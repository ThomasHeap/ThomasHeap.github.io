My research focusses on ways of making probabilistic inference better. 

In particular, I am currently working on ways of making variational inference, fast maximum likelihood fitting of exponential family distributions and moment estimation scale better in the number of latent variables in the probabilistic model.

In addition to this primary line of enquiry I am interested in:

* Deep learning theory
* Bayesian Machine learning more generally

Before starting my PhD I worked in industry on speech recognition for fraud detection.
