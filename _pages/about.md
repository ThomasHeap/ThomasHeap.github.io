My research focuses on ways of making probabilistic inference better. 

In particular, I am currently working on ways of making [wake-sleep type variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11022), fast maximum likelihood fitting of exponential family distributions and [moment estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17374) scale better in the number of latent variables in the probabilistic model. In this research I am supervised by [Laurence Aitchison](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~laurence/index.html).

In addition to this primary line of enquiry I am interested in:

* Deep learning theory
* Bayesian Machine learning more generally

Before starting my PhD I worked in industry, most recently as a research engineer working on speech recognition for fraud detection. Prior to that I did my MSc at The University of Edinburgh where my thesis was supervised by [David Sterratt](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/sterratt) and [Melanie Stefan](http://melaniestefan.net/).
