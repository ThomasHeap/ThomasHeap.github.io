# [Alan - Tensorised probabilistic programming](https://alan-ppl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Alan is a probabilistic programming language that aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to perform fast Bayesian inference. In particular it is designed to showcase the “Massively Parallel” framework as outlined in [Massively Parallel Reweighted Wake-Sleep](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11022) and the source trick for computing posterior moments as outlined in [Using autodiff to estimate posterior moments, marginals and samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17374).
