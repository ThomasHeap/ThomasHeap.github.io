## Projects

Here are some of the research projects I've been involved in:

### Alan: Tensorised Probabilistic Programming

A probabilistic programming language designed to provide a simple and intuitive way to perform fast Bayesian inference. Alan showcases two key innovations:

- The "Massively Parallel" framework from our paper [Massively Parallel Reweighted Wake-Sleep](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11022)
- The source trick for computing posterior moments, detailed in [Using autodiff to estimate posterior moments, marginals and samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17374)
