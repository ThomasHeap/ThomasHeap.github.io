8.8,10.4, You're out.
10.4,12.0, This is our new direction.
12.0,13.200000000000001, I'm out of here.
13.200000000000001,14.0, Not weak.
14.0,16.240000000000002," We had a, I was at an offsite last week."
16.240000000000002,17.44, That's why I wasn't here.
17.44,19.84," And we had all sorts of talks about, you know,"
19.84,21.84, metrics and how to get more listeners and stuff.
21.84,23.44, So this is what I came up with.
23.44,24.64, You guys into that.
24.64,25.28, That's pretty brilliant.
25.28,25.76, Yeah.
25.76,26.72, Gaming for the win.
26.72,28.16, Because I hear that's what people say now.
28.16,29.92, Something's cool for the win.
30.72,31.52, It's true.
31.52,32.32, Yeah.
32.32,32.96, So gaming.
32.96,33.76, That's what we are now.
33.76,35.12, FTW Radio.
36.0,37.36, FTL Radio.
37.36,39.76," Oh, man."
39.76,40.96, I'm just kidding.
40.96,41.44, We're not.
42.4,43.44, They made me do that.
43.44,44.56, They made me do that opener.
46.400000000000006,46.8, All right.
46.8,47.44, I don't know.
47.44,49.28, I was told you have to be a radio.
49.28,49.760000000000005, We are.
50.56,50.96, We are.
50.96,52.16, Because it's a brand now.
52.16,52.56, Egypt.
52.56,54.16, A lot of people being rebranded.
54.16,54.56, But we're.
54.56,54.96," Oh, yeah."
54.96,55.6, How can they get to?
55.6,56.480000000000004, Isn't that weird?
56.559999999999995,59.599999999999994," EGM is rebranding, even though it's still EGM."
59.599999999999994,62.08, And we don't have a magazine and we're still
62.08,63.04, GIFT up to you.
63.04,63.519999999999996, Yeah.
63.519999999999996,63.839999999999996, Huh.
63.839999999999996,65.03999999999999, What's wrong with that picture?
65.03999999999999,65.84, I'm not in drum.
65.84,68.72," Well, games for Windows still exist outside the magazine."
68.72,69.92," It's like, oh, or does it?"
69.92,70.56, Yeah.
70.56,71.6, EGM still exists.
71.6,71.92, Oh.
72.64,75.12, I did get a new game for Windows game on my desk.
75.12,76.88, I hadn't seen one in a long time.
76.88,78.96," And one showed up today and it renewed my, oh,"
78.96,81.03999999999999, all my faith in the platform.
81.03999999999999,82.32," No, it was Kung Fu Panda."
82.32,83.03999999999999," Oh, okay."
83.03999999999999,85.28, We didn't get mess of it.
85.44,86.88," No, we didn't get mess of it."
86.88,89.44," But I did get combat arms from next on,"
89.44,90.96000000000001, so maybe we can be next on radio.
92.96000000000001,94.4, We'll be whoever's paying us.
95.44,96.88, I'm sketch up radio.
97.68,98.56, That doesn't matter.
98.56,99.6, Puerto Rican candy.
100.32000000000001,105.44," You know, we talked about this last week about how we got the candy from Puerto Rico."
105.44,106.56," And there was the,"
106.56,110.32," it was basically corn meal and a little bit of sugar in construction paper,"
110.32,114.96000000000001, cylinder and I was surprised to find out we have quite a few
114.96,116.55999999999999, listeners in Puerto Rico and it was cool.
116.55999999999999,118.39999999999999, They all rode in and they all knew immediately what it was.
118.39999999999999,119.52," And they're like, this is a go for you."
120.16,123.83999999999999, And this stuff is classic because no one on the island will eat this shit.
124.55999999999999,128.32," And it's like, it furthermore, the, the name what you do is that you,"
128.32,131.92," if you do eat it, you get it, you turn it to like,"
131.92,133.92," you know, wet cement in your mouth."
133.92,137.12," And then you spit it out in someone's hair, but as you spit, you say,"
137.12,137.84, go for you.
139.44,141.68," So you dump the shit then in there, in their hair."
142.24,143.2, And then hair.
143.2,143.6, Yeah.
143.92,145.84, So that was that thing you gave me to eat.
145.84,148.07999999999998, Was that out of that cod that thing was awful?
148.07999999999998,151.35999999999999," No, I give you it was like a guava jelly,"
151.35999999999999,153.51999999999998, but smell like a dirty sock or something.
154.32,157.84," Look bad, it's smell bad and then it just tasted fucking foul."
159.51999999999998,160.4," No, no, no, no."
160.4,160.72," No, no, no, no."
163.92,165.12, You're just doing a candy.
166.95999999999998,168.16," So, so do not want."
168.16,169.92, Do not do not want.
170.32,173.51999999999998," But you've been told that this is, you know,"
173.51999999999998,176.16," this is, I mean, all those memes I can use now."
176.16,178.48," Yeah, it's a candy confirmed."
183.83999999999997,184.72, Now it's funny again.
184.72,187.2," Uh, yeah, we're bringing it back to the funny."
187.2,188.16, It's retro.
188.16,188.95999999999998," So, right."
188.95999999999998,190.23999999999998, Two years of it at Hot Topics.
192.23999999999998,194.07999999999998," Uh, do we introduce our associate?"
194.07999999999998,196.48, I didn't do the date any of that shit this week.
196.48,198.48, I missed one week and I've just fallen off.
198.56,200.56, I think you should let people figure it out for themselves.
200.56,202.88," Yeah, it's the day that you're listening to this."
202.88,203.92, That's what day it is.
203.92,204.72, My hope.
204.72,205.92," If you need any more help than that,"
205.92,207.12, like a fucking calendar.
207.12,207.92, It's also the other way.
207.92,209.28," Oh my, your timekeeper."
209.28,210.56, It's a little hit a life.
212.88,214.0, So that's introduce us us.
215.2,216.32, It's Brian Scott.
216.32,217.6, Anthony Gagos.
217.6,218.16, Go for you.
220.79999999999998,221.83999999999997, And he'll show on Meloy.
221.83999999999997,224.07999999999998, Hi. Hi.
224.07999999999998,226.07999999999998," That's your new, like new kids on the block name."
226.08,227.12," Actually, go for you."
227.12,228.72," I mean, you don't need to go for you."
228.72,229.44000000000003," Wait, what's your new name?"
229.44000000000003,230.16000000000003, They should make that.
230.16000000000003,231.28, That would be a good boy band.
231.28,231.92000000000002, Go for you.
231.92000000000002,232.56, Go for us.
233.92000000000002,234.64000000000001, Chuff.
234.64000000000001,235.20000000000002, Chuff.
235.20000000000002,235.68, And there we go.
235.68,236.16000000000003," No, no, no, no."
236.16000000000003,237.36," Oh, no, no."
237.36,238.48000000000002," Anthony, I think you like."
238.48000000000002,241.76000000000002, Can we just say Anthony's like officially on this podcast now?
242.56,242.96, Right?
242.96,244.32000000000002, You're not really a guest anymore.
244.32000000000002,245.44," I mean, we don't have a magazine."
245.44,245.92000000000002," Yeah, we have."
245.92000000000002,248.16000000000003, So it's not like we're the magazine staff plus guests.
249.20000000000002,250.24, I think you're on.
250.24,251.36, I think you're on who we are.
251.36,251.84, Yeah.
251.84,253.84, I think it's official as of last week because
253.84,257.92," usually when I fill in the comments part in the ID3 tag for the, for the,"
257.92,262.0," I put with Jeff Green, Sean Elliott, you know, the regular is"
262.0,264.24," and then period and then featuring,"
264.24,265.76," Oh, Bobito and Anthony."
265.76,267.12," But this time, he was in the with his."
267.12,267.76, Wow.
267.76,270.64," But so Bobito, we're at to you too, to be on."
270.64,272.88, And then also Chris from Boyer.
272.88,273.76, He's been on a few times.
273.76,274.24, Yes.
274.24,277.44, Now that he's left his office here.
277.44,279.28000000000003," Oh, he's he's freelancing full time."
279.28000000000003,281.04, He said that he would love to come in more.
281.04,281.6, He's welcome.
281.6,283.6, So this is part of the extended brody
283.6,285.68, and he's a real family to say farewell to Chris.
285.68,287.20000000000005," I mean, he's not really going anywhere."
287.20000000000005,288.48, We're still going to be working with them.
288.48,288.8, It's right.
288.8,289.68, Even features and stuff.
289.68,291.20000000000005," But I mean, yeah, it's like he's it."
291.84000000000003,292.88, He was an institution.
292.88,293.92, Who's an institution here?
293.92,295.52000000000004," And I think it's a serious, I don't know."
295.52000000000004,298.72," I'm not supposed to say it this way, but even it's a, it's a serious loss to me."
298.72,299.76000000000005, Is it having a colleague?
299.76000000000005,302.40000000000003," So when I really really admire respect and, you know,"
302.8,304.0, have fun working with.
304.24,307.36," And yeah, I mean, I learned so much from him over the years."
307.36,310.8," And I don't think I, I'm not even sure if I would have had the EGM job."
310.8,312.40000000000003, They got me started doing this if not for him.
312.4,316.71999999999997," He was the first person I, I said an email to and I was like, hey, you know, like, what,"
316.71999999999997,320.88," do you have any any any information you can give me about, you know,"
320.88,322.08, potential work and stuff like that.
322.08,325.44," But then um, and he was just, he was a first free writer."
325.44,328.4," I mean, I look forward to seeing the stuff he does now, even beyond gaming and stuff."
328.4,330.0, I know he's got a few things lined up.
330.0,331.03999999999996, So I look forward to that.
331.03999999999996,337.35999999999996, But I also wanted to say I wanted to celebrate his his parting gift for the game group.
337.35999999999996,341.91999999999996, And that was it's a shame that it wasn't caught on video because it would have made the perfect
342.0,343.2, one up show segment.
343.2,345.68," But he basically took a, this is on his blog as well."
345.68,347.36, So everyone go to just blog and check it out.
347.36,351.52000000000004," He, he took a bunch of random old magazines that we had laying around the office that were"
351.52000000000004,352.40000000000003, poly bag.
352.40000000000003,358.24, And very carefully with an exact knife open the bags up and insert it new bonuses.
358.96000000000004,364.96000000000004," And then he had he had the our artists, my crews produced, you know, new, you know, a branding"
364.96000000000004,369.36," for the bag so that it would say like so they, for one example, they took the, it was called"
369.44,373.92, the Battle Station's issue of EGM and it was a show to picture the PS3 with the tomato
373.92,375.12, thrown on it.
375.12,379.12, So he got a bunch of grape tomatoes and he put those in the bag and it was like with free
379.12,380.8, tomatoes is on the thing.
380.8,386.64," He did another, he got a CGW and he included like a golden girl's novel and put that in her."
386.64,393.2," He got Forbes and he put like straight shooter or whatever, like this business PS2 game put that in there."
394.0,398.0, And random action figure parts and stuff would come with one like general badass
398.0,399.76, reuse was to be a Star Wars character.
399.76,402.32, He came with like a fanny pack and it's something.
402.32,406.96, But so he took all those when he was done and he set him in the magazine rack at Walgreens down
406.96,408.24, the street.
408.24,412.72," And because the people that worked there have no idea, they will sit there forever and ever."
412.72,417.44," And so until the next time when, you know, when the magazine starter comes in and"
417.44,418.44, goes through there.
418.44,422.0, But so now it's been a week and a half and I went there today and they're all still there.
422.0,426.48," They're, to me know somehow haven't been smushed, but I mean, there's got to be a walk up"
426.48,429.6," and they're like, the people will do the same magazine."
429.6,432.24, So he's fucking golden girls.
432.24,434.24, He's a few.
434.24,435.24, He's a hilarious.
435.24,437.24, Can you imagine if someone did buy it?
437.24,440.56," And then the customer service rep gets an email like, my tomatoes were rotten."
440.56,444.32," I ordered him, you're special if you."
444.32,448.16," So he did, he's take pictures of all these and you can check those out."
448.16,450.16, But I want the golden girls.
450.16,453.76," This is one of those things where like, I mean, we get a golden girl's novel."
453.76,454.76, That's Chrisman.
454.76,455.76, He's like a big fan of.
455.76,457.44," Also, golden girls are awful."
457.44,459.44, What the fuck is that?
459.44,463.24, How did that product get extended that way?
463.24,464.24," Well, they had that."
464.24,467.2, I just can't get enough of that wacky sitcom.
467.2,469.88, I need Doritos a novel.
469.88,471.44, See what they're up to.
471.44,477.44," This is, how is that any different than like, when, when 12 buys, you know, don't go there."
477.44,483.71999999999997," Sorry, you're not going to say, but golden girls, you know, we got a, so when, I think"
483.72,486.32000000000005, his Nick Sutner had the Hulk movie novel.
486.32000000000005,487.68, It's not a game.
487.68,488.68, Yeah.
488.68,492.28000000000003," When novelization of the movie, there's more pussy in the Golden Girls book."
492.28000000000003,493.28000000000003, I'll stick to that.
493.28000000000003,494.28000000000003," Oh, God."
494.28000000000003,495.28000000000003," Oh, what?"
495.28000000000003,496.28000000000003, What the fuck?
496.28000000000003,498.28000000000003," I'm totally kidding, man."
498.28000000000003,500.28000000000003, That's so wrong.
500.28000000000003,507.84000000000003, I got the space balls novel back when that was quote unquote really.
507.84000000000003,508.84000000000003, Yeah.
508.84000000000003,509.84000000000003, Good.
509.84000000000003,511.8, That's why it was a good space ball.
511.8,512.8000000000001," See, right up in the book?"
512.88,515.16," Yeah, the novelization of the novel."
515.16,516.16, The novelization of the novel.
516.16,517.7199999999999," Yeah, go, God, here it comes."
517.7199999999999,518.7199999999999, I can feel it.
518.7199999999999,520.4399999999999, This is my favorite joke on the way.
520.4399999999999,522.16, But when you're reading the book.
522.16,523.16," Oh, yeah."
523.16,524.16, They did ruin the couple of them.
524.16,525.16," Yeah, they."
525.16,526.16, Yeah.
526.16,530.16," I think he calls everyone around him shit head, but in the book they were all idiots."
530.16,531.16, No.
531.16,537.16," It's like, hey, a little bit of profanity that I clomped on to as a 13 year old."
537.16,538.16, It's been removed.
538.16,539.4399999999999, It's worth blogging about nowadays.
539.4399999999999,540.4399999999999, Yeah.
540.4399999999999,541.8399999999999," I still don't get the Golden Girls book, though."
541.9200000000001,542.84, I read the book.
542.84,543.84, I've got your three.
543.84,546.6," See, all these things are like sci-fi geeky."
546.6,547.6, You sort of get that.
547.6,549.32, You think other people don't enjoy it?
549.32,552.24," It's like a modest rip or version of the Golden Girls, though."
552.24,553.24, Was it?
553.24,554.24, Was it?
554.24,555.24, Was it?
555.24,556.24, Was it?
556.24,557.24, Was it?
557.24,558.24, Was it?
558.24,559.24, Was it?
559.24,560.24, Was it?
560.24,561.24, Was it?
561.24,562.24, Was it?
562.24,563.24, Was it?
563.24,564.24, Was it?
564.24,565.24, Was it?
565.24,566.24, Was it?
566.24,567.24, Was it?
567.24,568.24, Was it?
568.24,569.24, Was it?
569.24,570.24, Was it?
570.24,571.24, Was it?
571.24,571.44, Was it?
571.44,572.44, Was it?
572.44,573.2," Oh, we were talking about Joviya of Dedi."
573.2,577.24," We were, we were a client of hand got around."
577.24,578.2800000000001," That was her thing, right?"
578.2800000000001,579.7800000000001, Was her character treat?
579.7800000000001,580.7800000000001, Why?
580.7800000000001,581.7800000000001," Oh, yeah."
581.7800000000001,582.7800000000001, She did.
582.7800000000001,583.7800000000001, She's a slut.
583.7800000000001,584.7800000000001, I'm lying.
584.7800000000001,585.7800000000001, I don't know who we were.
585.7800000000001,586.7800000000001, I'm not sure.
586.7800000000001,587.7800000000001, I'm not sure.
587.7800000000001,588.7800000000001, You're wearing a client of hand.
588.7800000000001,590.9000000000001," She was like the wacky one, wasn't she?"
590.9000000000001,593.0200000000001," You know, she was the slut."
593.0200000000001,595.0400000000001, I just found a loose spot.
595.0400000000001,597.72, I think Betty White was the wacky one.
597.72,598.72," Oh, yeah."
598.72,599.72, So.
599.72,600.72, That's way more Golden Girls will never shoot a vid and talk to bat on this pide.
600.72,602.72, You've got the game?
602.72,604.72," No, there was a game."
604.72,606.72," Okay, I was getting scared."
606.72,608.72, I was getting scared.
608.72,610.72," Anthony, I played a whack game recently."
610.72,612.72," Actually, it's not that bad."
612.72,614.72," But next on, this is a comeback to combat arms,"
614.72,616.72, the makers of Maple Story.
616.72,618.72, The bottom deck.
618.72,619.72, Heartwriter.
619.72,621.72," Yeah, they've got a first person shooter coming out."
621.72,622.72, Close beta just ended.
622.72,624.72," Yeah, well, it's called combat arms."
624.72,626.72," It's basically,"
627.72,629.72," Yeah, it's not sci-fi or anything."
629.72,630.72, It's just modern warfare.
630.72,631.72, Animate.
631.72,632.72, Weapons you use.
632.72,633.72, No.
633.72,634.72," It's kind of like,"
634.72,635.72, Counter-strike.
635.72,636.72, Between Counter-strike.
636.72,637.72, One and two.
637.72,639.72," Yeah, like somewhere between, like, visually."
639.72,641.72," Yeah, somewhere between, like, yes, yes,"
641.72,644.72, one point six and then Counter-strike source.
644.72,647.72," And of course, it's on the free, free to play model."
647.72,650.72, So you have to buy everything that's going to be worth anything.
650.72,652.72, But you don't even get to keep it.
652.72,654.72," You pay for, like, you know, you use it for a week."
654.72,655.72, Yeah.
655.72,656.72, You can use that.
656.72,657.72, You can use that.
657.72,659.72, Then you can choose to have it for 12 hours.
659.72,662.72," You can pay more, but you get a discount for getting it for, like, a full week."
662.72,664.72, Or you can pay and get it for a month.
664.72,668.72, And how much time are they charging for these short duration items?
668.72,671.72," I don't know because it's all in game points, which you can either buy."
671.72,674.72, But you also earn game points as you're playing.
674.72,676.72," But the funny thing about the game is that it's, you know,"
676.72,679.72, it's made in Korea in the best part of the game.
679.72,682.72, It's a game that's made in Korea.
682.72,687.72, It's made in Korea in the best part that the best thing is going for right now is all of
687.72,688.72, Voice Chat.
688.72,691.72, It's like you hit the button to say something to your team.
691.72,695.72," But it's basically some Korean guy who speaks a little bit of English pretending to be, you"
695.72,696.72," know, GI Joe."
696.72,700.72," And so they're like, it's, you know, if you're playing in the game, you can hit it."
700.72,703.72," So you guys go, you are the hero."
703.72,706.72," Or say if you're setting it, if you're setting a charge, you're putting a claim"
706.72,707.72, or down.
707.72,710.72," You guys go, I'm changing the mind."
711.72,714.72, And it's supposed to be saying he's charging the mind or something.
714.72,715.72, What is changing it?
715.72,718.72," And then there's like, that's, who did dream us?"
718.72,720.72, You got to get these soundbites for this podcast.
720.72,723.72," You just play, yeah, we just spam it the whole time you're playing."
723.72,726.72," Well, you're not only that, but you buy better soundbites."
726.72,731.72," That's just, you should shot it with Sponning and kill everyone and then sit there and spam."
731.72,732.72, You are a hero.
732.72,736.72, It has that going for you.
736.72,739.72, It has sort of like an infinite spawn mode.
739.72,743.72," And it also has the counter strike thing, you know, where you basically plant the bomb and you"
743.72,744.72, should get a single spawn.
744.72,746.72, So I get in and I got some free bucks to spend.
746.72,751.72," So, you know, you just take the heavy machine gun and you just moe everyone down"
751.72,754.72," in your team and then you have, you know, someone on the other team that's your friend"
754.72,755.72, do the same to theirs.
755.72,758.72," And then you just both keep saying, you are the hero and then you both go at the"
758.72,760.72, bomb and stand and look at each other.
760.72,764.72, And the game can't end because the guys are the ones that are supposed to kill
764.72,765.72, one another.
765.72,767.72, You just sit there.
767.72,769.72, But I didn't get most of the time.
769.72,772.72," But most of the time, I don't know, the guys playing with us."
772.72,774.72, They hurt a little hard on it.
774.72,775.72," Yeah, I thought it was fun."
775.72,776.72, That was okay for a free game.
776.72,779.72," Like if it was on instantaction.com or something, I occasionally."
779.72,780.72, Yeah.
780.72,784.72, Could you just get a dollar for saying that in tonight's game?
784.72,785.72," Yeah, that's a free set."
785.72,787.72, Or an in game dollar.
787.72,792.72, I got an in the game dollar for combat arms for saying it in the end and he got it.
793.72,794.72, I got it.
794.72,795.72, I got it.
795.72,796.72, I got my gun.
796.72,798.72, But it's getting a fun game.
798.72,806.72," But we've also been playing like, are you already talking about it in the last podcast?"
806.72,808.72, Because I wasn't here to talk about trials.
808.72,809.72," Yeah, we do."
809.72,810.72, We do.
810.72,811.72, We do.
811.72,812.72, We do.
812.72,813.72," Yeah, we do."
813.72,814.72, We do.
814.72,815.72, Yeah.
815.72,817.72, Everything I read about it made us sound hard.
817.72,818.72, It's very difficult.
818.72,819.72, Yeah.
819.72,821.72, I'm letting it to that.
821.72,824.72, I'm going to say something about you guys for what we have quite a few news items and stuff.
824.72,825.72, But we do.
825.72,826.72, We get a lot tomorrow.
826.72,828.72, I'm going to see your next on ticket.
828.72,829.72, It reminded me.
829.72,830.72, I'm seeing tomorrow.
830.72,833.72, I'm seeing the square in X free MMO.
833.72,835.72, Concerto gate or free MMO.
835.72,836.72, It's a little more.
836.72,837.72, Concerto gate.
837.72,838.72, Concerto gate.
838.72,839.72, That's what it's called.
839.72,840.72, Is that right?
840.72,841.72, Concerto gate.
841.72,842.72," Yeah, right."
842.72,844.72, Which I guess is the sequel to an MMO that's like been big over in Japan.
844.72,845.72, Some other gate.
845.72,846.72, I don't know what.
846.72,849.72," But anyway, I looked at the screens and it's all like big headed."
849.72,850.72," Anime, it's cool."
850.72,851.72, It's a little frogging in fields.
851.72,852.72, Your favorite.
852.72,853.72, Yeah.
853.72,854.72, So I'm dragging along Alice.
854.72,855.72, We hang.
855.72,858.72, Because I think she's more of the target audience.
858.72,860.72, She actually wants to see it.
860.72,861.72, So that means something.
861.72,862.72, Yeah.
862.72,864.72," As about to say, did you just assume Alice wanted to do that?"
864.72,865.72, No.
865.72,867.72, Where's an Asian girl?
867.72,869.72, Someone find me one.
869.72,870.72, Non-hush.
870.72,871.72, If you wanted to go.
871.72,873.72," Like, please go."
873.72,874.72, Maybe it'd be good.
874.72,876.72, She just kind of get the feeling.
876.72,877.72, It might not be the demographic.
878.72,880.72, Just call me wagging.
880.72,881.72, Charotogate.
881.72,882.72, Yeah.
882.72,883.72, Does it music based or do you have an idea?
883.72,885.72, You're just looking at the pictures right now.
885.72,886.72," No, Clio."
886.72,887.72, I'm just looking at these.
887.72,889.72, The kids with like three inch eyes.
889.72,890.72, Which did you share?
890.72,895.72, It didn't look much different from like squares of crystal chronicles.
895.72,896.72," Yeah, there's three."
896.72,897.72, There's three manners.
897.72,898.72, He raises really cute.
898.72,899.72, Yeah.
899.72,902.72, There's a whole subset of square games that have that look.
902.72,904.72, So it's not scary thing is like.
904.72,906.72, I picture people like Alice playing it.
906.72,909.72, I also picture like the extreme opposite of the guy's.
909.72,910.72, Of course.
910.72,914.72," Hard core beards in the you know, FF7 wall scrolls."
914.72,916.72," Well, when Karen was talking about,"
916.72,917.72, What's it called?
917.72,920.72," Hello, Katie online on legendary thread."
920.72,923.72," You know, she was talking about how you had to submit a,"
923.72,925.72," you know, an application video."
925.72,926.72, A video application.
926.72,928.72," Yeah, because they wanted to see you."
928.72,930.72," You know, because I think partly the concern."
930.72,931.72, I'm sure.
931.72,932.72, I'm sure.
932.72,934.72, I'm going to have these predatory guys in there.
934.72,936.72," I'm tell you, I'm tell you, I'm lying."
936.72,937.72, Yeah.
937.72,939.72, So they may need to do that with concherto.
939.72,940.72," Okay, I don't know."
940.72,943.72," Or maybe this was the first, you know,"
943.72,947.72, M big headed anime MMO for a grown up guys like us.
947.72,950.72, Maybe maybe maybe maybe a few weeks we're all going to be in here talking about it.
950.72,952.72, Leveling up strategies.
952.72,953.72, Sean's going to be talking about.
953.72,954.72, Can we continue?
954.72,955.72, Can we continue?
955.72,956.72, Can we continue?
956.72,957.72, Can we continue?
957.72,958.72, Can we continue?
958.72,959.72, Can we continue?
959.72,960.72, Can we continue?
960.72,961.72, Can we continue?
961.72,962.72, Can we continue?
962.72,963.72, Can we continue?
963.72,964.22, Can we continue?
964.22,967.22, Can I continue or continue gonna continue?
967.22,969.22," The wishes are clear,Day Elsa."
969.22,970.22," Whoa, if possible."
970.22,971.62, Yeah
971.62,973.22, I'm finally here with Challenge laughing.
973.22,973.26, The Black White White White zouden begins
973.26,975.22," So, for example, really freshman winners in Follow-Up."
975.22,976.22," Oh, overall."
976.22,978.22," Yeah, I'm just not sure how many of this is going on."
978.22,979.22, You give me a pen today now.
979.22,981.22," Look, how disciplines are going"
981.22,983.22, Think I got actively suited up at the還有 website.
984.22,986.22," So, you can go and see more ofンタ sort of internal dive."
986.22,987.22, Theה obligation红berry.
987.22,988.22, I Spartan Siumas.
988.22,989.22," Obviously, we are in line."
989.22,991.22, The multi- zwylems labeled by and traffic immediately.
991.22,992.22," Yeah, this is across-"
992.22,997.5," yesterday. That was kind of the big deal with the four. So that's the, you know, the online,"
998.0600000000001,1003.82," you know, depository repository of all the content that users are going to create throughout"
1003.82,1010.7," this game's lifetime, you know, a wiki of content that you upload your shit and then anyone"
1010.7,1014.7, can just download it immediately and stick it in their game and then your game will evolve
1014.7,1019.5, with that content. Which is a cool idea right now there's not a whole lot there yet other than
1019.98,1024.46, a lot to create yours because that's all that they've for Lisa far. You'll be putting up an interview
1024.46,1028.78, to have a sort of Johnson who's the lead designer now. What's his business?
1028.78,1033.58," Ah, no, he's not lead designer. I'm not sure if his exact title. So let's do some rough"
1033.58,1038.7," photos. Yeah, he's in a very important position on the score. Yeah,"
1038.7,1044.86," so on Johnson, if you don't know him, he was the lead designer of SIV4. So that he did AI or something like"
1045.82,1051.8999999999999, that that first score. That was what he was ostensibly hired for and now he's gone on to do a lot more.
1052.4599999999998,1059.58, So so this interview will be going up on Thursday if I would add it to you. But the thing
1059.58,1063.34," we're talking about is I mean, you know, you're going to see it again. And like Sean said, I mean,"
1063.34,1068.78," right now it's odd because you know, when the, when the game was first unveiled, it definitely had this"
1069.74,1075.58," Carl Seigen billions and billions and the whole, you know, theme music for 2001 is space"
1075.58,1080.1399999999999," Odyssey kind of kind of moment. And then it later on, it became more and more about let's show off"
1080.1399999999999,1084.22," the the funny creatures that you can make. When we talked about that here before too, where I said,"
1084.22,1088.86," in the worst case scenario, it's just one of those books with three leaves that, you know,"
1088.86,1094.1399999999999, you combine page one with the feet that are on page 26 and the midsection and it's on page 15
1094.14,1101.3400000000001, and you get this feature. And it's like we know that there's a game to it. But right now we've seen
1101.3400000000001,1107.8200000000002," we've been looking at this. Yes, we know you can make these funny and and quote and cue animals"
1107.8200000000002,1112.7800000000002," and so more importantly, they will animate and they'll sort of, you know, spring to life on the screen."
1112.7800000000002,1117.0200000000002," But I think we all want it. I mean, how much better would it be if they said, hey, Sean, Jeff or,"
1117.0200000000002,1121.42," you know, whoever, or some Ryan, you get to go there. We'll put you on two computers. You get to play"
1121.5,1125.98, whatever sections you want because you can start the game in the save stage. You can start it in the space
1125.98,1133.02," fairing stage and you can send, you know, that your creations back and forth to with one another through"
1133.02,1137.02," the sport PDF, you can play, but then just find out what happens. You know, the really interesting things"
1137.02,1141.5," that we were talking about, what like, say if you're in a tribal stage and you start to mess with, you know,"
1141.5,1146.6200000000001," your neighbors or, you know, you start to influence them and how exactly as a work, how many options do you have?"
1146.62,1153.02," Or is this just like, is that now sort of like the afterthought to a game that's really just about creating,"
1153.7399999999998,1158.9399999999998," right, basically, cute things that are going to survive by being the cutest and"
1158.9399999999998,1162.78," right, and download it on me. I'll always compete when they first announced it, my big thing that"
1162.78,1167.02, excited me most was the idea of the evolution idea. It's like the thing I'm doing here in the
1167.02,1172.4599999999998," cellular stage seven stages from now like what are the repercussions going to be. And if it's,"
1172.54,1176.6200000000001," if it turns out like, yeah, that is many as you thought, then. But in fact, we know they're having"
1176.6200000000001,1181.98," trouble linking all the different sections together. So we don't know how, how much that feeling is"
1181.98,1186.78," going to carry over. You know, every time they show the game to the media, like even the last time"
1186.78,1192.3," we all went for that, the big media event, they were careful to have all the different stages at,"
1192.3,1197.5," you know, physically different stages in the building itself. So I was like, okay, now we're all going to"
1197.5,1202.38," walk over here and you'll see the save game for a little while. And it was like, wait, I just want to"
1202.38,1207.98, see the whole thing at once. And even then it wasn't to see the save game. It was to see the sorts of
1207.98,1214.38," tribal structures you can create in this, in this societal part that's a building in machines that"
1214.38,1221.0200000000002," you can create. And they're also letting you play the game itself, like players can play it from"
1221.0200000000002,1227.5," any point. Yeah, like you don't have, you could start at the city game forever. Then does make me"
1227.58,1231.9," worry about the bigger picture. In the interview of Soren Johnson, he actually talks about"
1233.58,1240.78," the even in-house, the sort of not conflict, but back and forth, it's like the creative folks"
1240.78,1245.66," are having with the more game folks, you know, like, which how much to tilt along where the other,"
1245.66,1255.58," like, is it just a cute creator or is it a game with a game? And so when's the expected release date?"
1255.6599999999999,1260.1399999999999," Again, September is it? I thought I thought it was. I think September is the last they said, yeah."
1260.9399999999998,1265.02," Yeah. So in the pod in the thread that we had on email, before we came in here, I was,"
1265.74,1271.8999999999999," you know, using Ashley's, uh, stoking the game bone or metaphor for this game. And at my feeling here"
1271.8999999999999,1279.74," now is that we are in a, you know, semi-flacet state or or possibly a, possibly a blue ball state."
1279.74,1284.46," Might be the more, might be the more appropriate one. Like that was so much excitement for so long."
1284.54,1289.9," Oh my God, it's for, uh, and now like we've just been waiting and waiting and this is like people are just like,"
1289.9,1295.74," kind of, you know, right. I mean, it's not for one. It's still with any protracted, um, like,"
1296.7,1301.9," announcement to delivery time frame, like you got Duke, Duke, and forever, like who really gives a"
1301.9,1305.9," crap, but yeah. There's that. And then there's the other thing about instead of, you know, ramping"
1305.9,1310.6200000000001," and ratcheting up the excitement by showing increasingly, you know, fascinating and surprising"
1310.6999999999998,1313.8999999999999," elements of the game. And then in this case, it worked in, and we'll see opposite direction,"
1313.8999999999999,1319.8999999999999," whereas I described it, it starts with this potentially infinite possibility. Yeah. And where you look at it,"
1319.8999999999999,1324.3799999999999," and you just start thinking about, oh, God, can I do this? Can I do this? Can I do that? Which is such an"
1324.3799999999999,1330.1399999999999," excellent way to, to start to hype your game. And then it's become more and more specific to the point"
1330.1399999999999,1334.62," we're now. We're like, let me just like I said to reiterate that they just went backwards. I mean,"
1334.62,1339.34, now should be the point where I was thinking about what happens when I'm going through the universe and
1339.34,1344.3," and seeding these planets. And if I can find the equivalent of my own, you know, past on"
1344.3,1348.54," other planets and stuff like that. Instead of like, well, can this thing work? If I put web feed on the"
1348.54,1354.3799999999999," front and if I put like, if so, right, whatever. But if they were releasing assets and information,"
1354.3799999999999,1358.86," like the way that the game itself is supposed to progress. Like, how cool would that have been?"
1358.86,1363.1799999999998," If, you know, a year or two ago, you were, they were showing these little duck-feeted creatures,"
1363.1799999999998,1367.5," but then they're like, oh, and guess what? Now you can be able to do that. Or if they showed"
1367.5,1372.86," it in the little level of stages, right? So yeah, we just went out about going to space or something."
1372.86,1376.86," Right. Yeah. And then just kept going through that. But the deal is, is that, I mean, I think we will"
1376.86,1380.86," see those kind of marketing strategies in the future for games after the success of, you know,"
1380.86,1385.98," call it a before where it was like announced boom, it's coming out. Same fence with crisis warhead,"
1385.98,1389.98," which, you know, we'll talk about later. That's something Apple, like they just had the WWE"
1389.98,1393.74, DS or whatever. That's something Apple has been doing forever. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much like they don't
1393.74,1398.3, talk about a product until it's literally like either on the shelf the day they announced it
1398.3,1403.9," or a month away. Yeah. They showed exactly really for them. Yeah. We were, we had our edit meeting here"
1403.9,1409.74," yesterday, you know, our weekly meeting and David Ellis, the game videos was not in the meeting."
1409.74,1415.18, He was outside basically like listening live to the announcement about the new iPhone.
1415.18,1418.94," And he was like the star of our meeting, even though he wasn't there, because he kept going to the"
1418.94,1424.14," window and holding up like, you know, the latest fact he deserved on the radii. There's something"
1424.14,1428.14, to 99 dollars. There's something that we're all excited. There's something exciting about being able
1428.14,1433.5," to get that thing to know that. And he just announced it. And like, you can actually in the"
1433.5,1437.74," store right now, right? You didn't know about it, but you could go by and also doubt that that"
1437.74,1443.26," with half like a. I mean, didn't know. It's just because the way that the pace that tech evolves,"
1443.26,1448.54," you know, it's like when, say when I first saw a Quake Wars, I was like, wow, this is mind blowing,"
1448.54,1452.94," and at the time, I was playing battlefield, too. And then it was like, then that year passed and"
1452.94,1457.74," 2142 came out and then another year, and then it came out was like, and then at that point,"
1457.74,1461.18," it was like, wow, this game doesn't look as good as a lot of the other stuff that's out now. But"
1461.18,1464.78," you're like, I remember when you first see it, if this is coming out this holiday season, it's going to"
1464.78,1470.94," just be phenomenal. The other side of this, though, is that magic will write and company would have"
1470.94,1475.82," had a hard time keeping it under wraps for so long, because I think they were so genuinely"
1475.8999999999999,1479.4199999999998," excited with the direction that they were taking with their game. And you could tell,"
1480.3,1483.58," maybe EA is maybe something for EA, so that's the end of their like, oh, well, we didn't"
1483.58,1487.98," want them to talk about it then, but it was a GDC, you know, we'll, we'll like really wanted to show"
1487.98,1491.6599999999999, other other developers. And then what was going on there? There's something to be said for showing it
1491.6599999999999,1496.62," off and then getting public feedback right away, like to even know, like, if you're sitting there"
1496.62,1501.5," making this game, you still know you have three years to sit there and go, okay, we're not even"
1501.5,1507.02," sure for totally on the right track. Yeah. So then they show it and then people go, wow, and then"
1507.02,1510.46," like, oh, good, we're on the right track. Yeah, I think there's something to that feedback system."
1510.46,1514.7," Mm-hmm. And there's no question that they're the EA, I don't know where they're at now in their"
1514.7,1518.94," heads, but certainly even the last time we went to see it, which was what, a couple months ago,"
1520.14,1526.86," that they were worried, you know, or they were concerned, you know, they definitely were wanted"
1526.86,1530.54," the feedback. That was part of the reason we were all there. You know, we should have let us play"
1531.5,1538.7," well, yeah. I still think it could be great. I'm still I'm still remaining optimistic about it."
1538.7,1543.98," Yeah, I'm too. And I think, you know, I do think that the sport pediatrician is key, you know,"
1543.98,1551.26," obviously, I think that that, you know, that that's what they should have been talking more, I think."
1552.22,1557.8999999999999," Just the idea that that we're all, you know, sharing this big, huge pool of content and that"
1557.9,1562.3000000000002, your content could come in and and fuck with my game. I think it's such a neat idea.
1562.3000000000002,1566.0600000000002, Another cool way to promote it right now would have been instead of like having people come in and
1566.0600000000002,1570.3000000000002," just, you know, make more creatures, which we've already been doing is to take us around and show"
1570.3000000000002,1576.0600000000002," us the best sort of, you know, sport pedias that they have there. Like they mentioned when we"
1576.0600000000002,1579.26," were there last that they had an alphabet manager, we're all there and everything right. We're"
1579.26,1583.3400000000001," reading on letters, they had another, it was kind of based on the Beatles, yellow submarine movie."
1583.82,1589.26," And if they, um, if they went and showed us that, say, look, here's not like some stuff that"
1589.26,1593.82," people cobbled together while having drinks and hanging out with a ride over 30 minutes, but these"
1593.82,1597.74, are the things that we've been making over the past year. And these are the ones that are proven
1597.74,1602.22," sticky that they're still around and that they're still, if they show us each of those that,"
1602.22,1607.74," I think that would even be cooler than, like I said, the hoofs on the back and the duck feed on the"
1607.74,1613.26," front. A Robert Ashley's, no, Robert who is, no, Scott Sharkey's penis or"
1614.22,1619.66," I think that went around the office. Right, that's the, you're going to see a lot of penis"
1619.66,1624.94," horses or a pita, I think, a long stay. Yeah. Like, yep, you can make a penis."
1626.94,1630.54," Yeah, and you're a car that's penis shaped, I don't know that drives around this"
1630.54,1639.42," penis shaped continent on a penis shaped. Yeah, maybe you can even filter your content just for"
1640.3000000000002,1644.8600000000001," penis world. Yeah. It was kind of fun flipping through this bar of pita. I mean,"
1644.8600000000001,1648.54," or there are a few that like in thumbnail form was like, hey, that's intriguing enough to click on."
1648.54,1652.8600000000001," Even though it was kind of all scattershot, it wasn't organized in the way Sharkey's saying"
1652.8600000000001,1658.0600000000002," probably would be a good idea. Right. And then, you know, you can tag that if you see a guy's"
1658.0600000000002,1662.54," creature that you do think is cool, some guys in the art design, you can basically, like a podcast,"
1662.54,1667.5, you can subscribe to that guy. So any content that this guy ever makes will automatically get
1667.58,1672.14," downloaded into your game. I mean, they're doing, it's a neat experiment, I think. You know,"
1672.7,1676.94," I don't think we want to write it off just yet. I mean, not today. Oh, this is not the"
1676.94,1682.14," many of us are, but yeah, the big key to me again is what you're saying, like, is"
1683.02,1688.46," are the implications of what will write started out thinking about and doing years ago,"
1689.18,1695.74," bearing fruit with this game, or has it evolved into this kind of, let's all make"
1695.74,1699.82, cute stuff and share it thing. We find out some of it. And it's worth it. Like you have
1699.82,1704.54," like, little big planet for the PS3, which is totally, let's make cute stuff and share it. And like,"
1704.54,1709.5," never have as I want really seen that there might be an inkling of a game, but people are really"
1709.5,1715.9," excited about that. So like, maybe by implying that there is this rich complex game from the beginning,"
1715.9,1722.86," they've, over, like, oversold it. Yeah, because that's a hype, I think, for a little big"
1722.9399999999998,1727.5," planet probably will think people are more excited for that in some ways. Well, it was originally"
1727.5,1733.26," like, sim everything, right? What's what they said? Yeah, I was like the working title. That's not"
1733.26,1741.1799999999998," bite enough too much. I am still, I still will buy up and I still play it for sure. What do you think,"
1741.1799999999998,1747.02," Ryan, you're going to play sport? Yeah. Okay. I mean, I don't know. Are you going to make a lost"
1747.1,1756.46," steamed creature? Okay. And my old, they, I don't know. I was really excited for it for a while."
1758.46,1764.62," Guys going nowhere. See, I don't know if it's going nowhere, but a classic gameboater. Even when I"
1764.62,1769.58," when I said it, there was an event today. Yes, to the group yesterday, it was like, uh,"
1770.46,1776.54," they could want to go with me. Yeah. Plays, they got free shuttles. Well, in our case,"
1776.54,1780.6999999999998," shuttles. We just, actually, you know, it's not even that we just went a couple months ago,"
1780.6999999999998,1784.3," but like they just sent another round, like when Scott Sharky went, this was just like,"
1784.3,1791.6599999999999," what a couple weeks ago, we go. Yeah. So now it's like, yeah, you got to spacey things out, right?"
1791.6599999999999,1795.58," Let me get all excited again. Studios turning up to 7 11. Yeah, you don't want to get"
1795.58,1804.1399999999999, a bag of Doritos and see it for. I'll be right. Yeah. Would you like to see Spore against her?
1804.1399999999999,1810.3, And not today. How about a lot of reticut? Are they going to what you play the game tonight?
1810.3,1815.58, I don't know. I don't know. I'm just hoping for some good crab cakes.
1818.3,1824.22," So and well and a t-shirt. Yeah, well, let's, let's, let's quit beating the bush with, uh,"
1824.3,1829.1000000000001," I mean, beating the bush. That's quit beating the horse. That horse. Yeah. Yeah."
1829.1000000000001,1831.98, That's for. That's for. That's for. That's for. I will be back with more spore.
1831.98,1835.02, Crisis warhead was just announced last week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1835.02,1841.34," Yeah. Talk about that. Yeah. What is it? It is sort of like an expansion pack, right? I don't"
1841.34,1845.82, know. It's not clear if it's a band-up. I think it's a band-up alone. I think it's a standalone. Okay.
1845.82,1850.78," I don't know the. Um, basically it follows. I'm looking at the the press part here. If all those"
1850.86,1857.58, sergeants psychosikes and his adventures on the other side of the island during the events of Christ.
1857.58,1861.98," Oh, so it's like a blue shot or something. That's exactly. Or like season two of last. Yeah."
1861.98,1869.1," You like the others. The enemies. The title is is maximum freedom, maximum explosions,"
1869.1,1875.66," and maximum psycho. Yeah. Oh, the. Oh, his name begins. Psycho psychosikes."
1875.66,1879.8200000000002," Is that his last name is psychosikes? How psychosikes? Oh, my. I don't know."
1879.8200000000002,1883.18," Wait, is this a character from the first one? I don't remember any of the characters. Yeah. He's like the"
1883.18,1887.3400000000001, Australian guy that you always dealing with all the time. It sounds like an MGS name.
1888.14,1893.1000000000001," It does. Well, they all have. They all had it. It means like that as tech psycho. Well, he was like"
1893.1000000000001,1899.42, he used a crazy guy. That's called psycho. It was stupid like that. But I am excited for this for a
1899.42,1903.5," few different reasons. Um, well, at that another bit of information that's being produced by a"
1903.58,1909.5," Crytex Hungarians studio on Budapest, where's the Crytex that came out now was from their Frankfort"
1909.5,1915.82," formerly coberg studio and Germany. And they also have a studio in Kiev, I think. So they're getting around"
1916.54,1923.74, global. It's going to it's going to use an upgraded version of the engine that powers crisis that we know.
1924.62,1931.18, And that you'd be like whatever. Here's why I'm excited about this. And it's just sort of
1931.26,1936.38, theoretical right now. But I suspect my whole thing with with crisis one was that it was a phenomenal
1936.38,1940.8600000000001, game. I still think it's something that anyone who's remotely interested in shooters needs to play.
1941.5,1946.0600000000002, And it was toward the end. I felt that like the NFL partner said that there's a lot of sort of
1946.0600000000002,1950.6200000000001, like prompts that don't work delivered on. And they had this fantastic idea that this island was going to
1950.6200000000001,1956.6200000000001," become, you know, frozen over. And early showings, you know, we're talking about, you know, frozen"
1956.6999999999998,1961.34, waves and aliens shooting out the surface beneath you so that you'd fall into the water.
1961.9799999999998,1965.82," And just using this, you know, cover, you know, enemies with it would you take cover. They would"
1965.82,1970.06," free flash freeze it and then break the cover leaving you, you know, exposed again. And none of"
1970.06,1976.4599999999998, these things happen. And I suspect that part of this has to do with like the minimum specs for the
1976.4599999999998,1981.8999999999999," game, because if they wanted to get the game, basically whatever you determine your minimum spec is"
1981.9,1986.3000000000002," going to be the limit. Anything above that is going to just be superficial. I mean,"
1986.3000000000002,1991.42," things can look a lot better. The extent of facts. An example, this is also a stock or clear skies coming"
1991.42,1996.5400000000002, out. They had this ability to make sort of like air masses move around objects and stuff. And so they
1996.5400000000002,2001.02," just kind of showed it was like meet where you're walking through something, you know, corroded factory."
2001.02,2005.42, And you see that there's air coming through a vent. And it's like cold air. So it's just placing
2005.42,2010.22," around the objects and stuff. And I was like, oh, imagine if they have their equivalent of like their"
2010.3,2014.14, ghosts and invisible enemies and stuff that did appear in original stock. But now you have to
2014.14,2018.22," track them using air movement stuff. But of course, you can't do that unless you're mince back"
2019.18,2024.06," caronation. Because everyone will be able to see that. So crisis, I think the mince back"
2024.06,2027.98," might have, I'm hypothesizing might have prevented them from doing a lot of the things with the"
2027.98,2032.3, ice that they wanted. And now that they've got this upgraded version of engine that they've that is
2032.3,2039.66," able to do things for the same spec, it might give them the chance to go in and and do some of the"
2039.74,2044.7, things with the ice that they probably intended to all along. I'm hoping that's the case. I think
2044.7,2048.3, the sense I also got was that it came out in some of the interviews that the Trvott and the
2048.3,2052.7000000000003," others that tried to get after the game's launch that it seemed like there it was a case of,"
2052.7000000000003,2057.1," well, this game had to come out now. It had to, you know, yay, yay, said it had to come out and,"
2057.1,2062.14," you know, for whatever reasons and we had to get it out in that probably meant compromising in a few"
2062.14,2068.38, areas. And now I'm just looking at this as maybe this is their chance to basically do everything they
2068.46,2075.7400000000002, really wanted to without the compromise. It's like another chance to go back. This is a PC only as
2075.7400000000002,2082.78," well despite, you know, there when Trvott came out and said the future, CryTek will develop for"
2082.78,2088.7000000000003," multiple platforms, not exclusively for PC, but this doesn't fall under that kind of makes sense"
2088.7000000000003,2095.58," that it's still PC exclusive. I would think. I mean, it's really just to follow up to the PC game,"
2096.06,2102.22, be a weird thing to start on consoles. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I always assumed he was speaking of
2102.22,2106.86," whatever his next one, you know, the console port. It's probably just come with both in one package."
2106.86,2112.7," Yeah. That could be the case. The blue box console port, but this was supposed to save PC gaming."
2112.7,2116.22," Well, they are, but they've already said that they've been working. That's probably what the"
2116.22,2120.62," key of studios doing or something. So this is cool. Like there's some other things too, because the"
2120.62,2125.42," way that the game is past, you can clearly be in another part of the island and have these like"
2125.42,2130.22," reference points. So you know when you're at, when the mount will spoilers, at this point now,"
2130.22,2133.2599999999998," like this is something else too. I don't want to talk about spoilers in a minute, but like,"
2135.5,2139.5," I think we should be able to talk about it, you know, freely. So if you are one of those people who"
2140.7799999999997,2144.62," how I plan on playing it when I get a new graphics card next year, turn it on podcast off right now."
2144.62,2149.74, Sean is about the spoil crisis. I think the statue de la立itation. Yeah. That's full. There's an enormous
2149.8199999999997,2154.2999999999997, mountain in the center of the island. And it starts to quake and entremble and then eventually
2154.2999999999997,2159.18," large pieces of it fall off. And it's sort of revealed that there's an, it's an actual an alien"
2159.18,2163.9799999999996, ship or an alien structure inside this mountain. So you could be anywhere in the island and sort of
2163.9799999999996,2169.4199999999996," sync up the time, as by saying, this is when that mountain starting to shape. Same thing with when"
2169.4199999999996,2174.3799999999997, the ice dome flash freezes the entire idea of the island. Do you have that as another fixed point
2174.46,2180.06," time where you don't really have to have, you know, in an addition to specifics of like"
2180.06,2185.1800000000003," when maybe someone issued a radio call or when you had a discussion with, you know, psychs when"
2185.1800000000003,2188.62, you're playing their original crisis and they can fit all that stuff in. They could probably have a
2188.62,2195.82," lot of fun with that in the way that you're saying like lost, lost has and other shows, novels, books,"
2195.82,2199.82," but there's an ender's game in Ender's Shadow, can't be divine too. If you ever get those ones,"
2199.82,2204.1400000000003," I haven't. They were reading, they come up all the time. Yeah, I think Ender's game. I read the first one"
2204.14,2209.98," now is fantastic. Yep. I saw copy a round's year office, maybe? Probably. I feel like we're"
2209.98,2215.66," moving on. You can grab it. Oh, it's hard. It's just after this podcast. Okay. Another game."
2215.66,2221.66," So the bitch in about spoilers. I mean, I want to get to this at some point in, I don't know,"
2222.2999999999997,2228.2999999999997," with with reviews and stuff specifically, because I think that it just really puts a"
2228.38,2233.1800000000003, scripted limitation on how we're able to substantiate any of the claims that we made.
2233.1800000000003,2236.94," And that's especially important to me in our review. So for example, if you're, you know, this"
2236.94,2241.26, is going to come up over and over again now with Metal Gear Solid 4 reviews coming out. There's no
2241.26,2246.1400000000003," one wants to spoil it. You know, I'll probably rightfully soak the way that those games are built on,"
2246.1400000000003,2251.6600000000003," you know, conspiracy after conspiracy and you don't want to ruin that. But at the same time,"
2251.6600000000003,2256.3," I mean, if you're looking at, if you want your review to sort of tell you what you're spending"
2256.38,2260.86," your time and money on rather than what you should spend your time and money on, you have to spoil,"
2260.86,2264.46," I believe. And you know, when I'm looking at some of the reviews that are out now that are,"
2264.46,2268.86," they're really there, like the second case, to just tell you to spend your money or not."
2268.86,2273.02," It's that they kind of entropyl this time, because they all start with, you already knew,"
2273.02,2277.26," you already pre-ordered this or you already know what I'm saying. So that next now,"
2277.26,2282.3," 2,000 words at point later. With though, they'll make claims like, you know, this"
2283.26,2288.3, is modeled after the Messiah or something. It's modeled after the story of the Messiah. And then
2288.3,2293.02," they'll just stop there and then this comment's kind of hanging there and it's like, when we read that,"
2293.02,2297.9," we have no reason whatsoever, not to suspect that that's the most cock of me being in the world, right?"
2297.9,2303.9," I mean, sure tons of things will do to Christ how many of them get it right, you know? Same thing,"
2303.9,2307.5800000000004," if you're going to be talking about the Matrix movies and the way that they do, you would need to say,"
2307.66,2313.1," here's how they handle it, here's how the connections link up, here's how the comparison fails and stuff."
2313.1,2318.2999999999997," So it's like without being able to substantiate that in the least bit because for fear of spoiling things,"
2318.2999999999997,2324.7," it's just this empty claim. It's like, okay, cool. Someone, I have no reason to trust him, you know,"
2324.7,2330.14," thinks that this is a great thing, that this is the story, the retelling of the Messiah story."
2330.14,2333.66," Well, for one thing, we know that like they probably haven't only thought it through,"
2333.74,2339.8199999999997," chances are in this industry, so, you know, they didn't do it because they couldn't,"
2339.8199999999997,2344.46," or they didn't think it through, they just, you know, there's that, but then also, I think that you can,"
2345.98,2350.22," you can't spoil, you just have to be smart about your spoiling, right? I mean, there's just like"
2350.22,2356.3799999999997," levels of things and areas where you know not to do it, right? Or maybe I shouldn't say you can't"
2356.3799999999997,2361.98," spoil it, you can sort of talk around a spoiler without, right? There are ways to present it,"
2362.06,2366.7," so that someone who has played it would know what you're talking about. Like, uh,"
2366.7,2370.14," those are the ones that would, these, they would want to, this came, they would want this Jesus,"
2370.14,2373.82," you know, if this really was a Christ-Elegre, the ones who played it would be the ones who would like"
2373.82,2377.82, to have that conversation with the reviewer. Right. And this was difficult in the same way for
2377.82,2382.14," games like Portal and BioShock, you know, mean more and more, we're having games where you can"
2382.14,2387.02," have some sort of, you know, this level of discussion on it that you can't, if the game is"
2387.02,2391.74," consistent with nothing more than, than putting dropping blocks in the right positions. And"
2392.38,2396.54," right now, I'm going to go ahead. I would think, you know, in the case of, I reviewed Portal and,"
2396.54,2401.34," you know, in half life two episode two, Sean reviewed BioShock, and I know we both had a hard time"
2401.74,2405.5, saying what we wanted to say without without being able to directly substantiate some of our
2405.5,2411.1," claims. And I think in the future, I would love to basically do what I'm saying is criticism. I"
2411.1,2415.34," think in most cases, there's, you like, it, it's filming music. You don't really need to"
2415.34,2420.78," differentiate them. Like a good, you know, movie review will be both a review and a critique at the"
2420.78,2425.1800000000003," same time. But because of the way that it works in gaming, it's like almost wish we had some space."
2425.1800000000003,2430.94," Like I was telling Ryan, I want to do a review of Metal Gear, but it's like it's not going to go"
2430.94,2433.9," on the review thing. There's no space for that. You know, when I mentioned so-and-also,"
2433.9,2437.1000000000004," and I'm like, oh, you could just blog about it or something. Like, no, you don't understand."
2437.1000000000004,2440.3, I'm talking about spending a lot more time than someone who's been under a review. I don't want
2440.3,2446.46," to just blog about it, you know, but I want to see a space for that. Right. I mean, in gaming."
2446.46,2453.26," And, but I do think you see articles in film, I mean, of course you do, that are, you know,"
2453.26,2458.38, what you're talking about. Like an analysis that then includes a discussion of the film and its
2458.38,2463.1800000000003," entirety, or maybe even a series of films in their entirety, including spoilers and what you're"
2463.1800000000003,2468.46," talking about, you know, you're talking about the themes of scut, which obviously would include"
2468.54,2472.94," what happened at the end, or what happened at crucial moments in the film. Right. And because that's"
2472.94,2478.14," part of the whole point they're making that are separate from our review, that are separate from the"
2478.14,2483.34, thing that came out on day one telling you whether to go to the theater or not. Right. So it seems like
2483.34,2487.82," we should and could be able to do both on this. We can. And they're saying, but there's still even"
2487.82,2493.02," in the types of like even in an entertainment weekly review, which is, you know, they tend to be"
2493.02,2497.66," really timely. So yeah, magazine because the magazine is published, publication schedule, they will do"
2498.14,2502.62," I think if you'd compare it to the threshold, the spoiler threshold for people reading about"
2502.62,2507.5," game reviews, I think they're spoiling a quite a lot, you know. Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah."
2507.5,2513.02," Okay. They do. Yeah. But anyway, that's that's out there. I want me in the spoiler thing"
2513.02,2516.7799999999997," getting to the point where I mean, it is hard too because that that I understand that. I mean,"
2516.7799999999997,2523.2599999999998," when you're talking about, having a discussion with people about why, or what it is that we're"
2523.2599999999998,2526.54," that we're spending our time on money on, you, you, you're have to assume that we've already spent"
2526.62,2531.42," time on money on it. So that that limits the audience. And of course, for a game like Mel gear,"
2531.42,2535.74, I'm in the same position. I don't get to play yet. I'm going to try to get it this week. So
2535.74,2539.2599999999998," but I guess the thing is, here's the other thing is, I think people are only like if people"
2539.2599999999998,2544.54," for audiences only looking to read about games in this critical way, like within the first week of"
2544.54,2549.82," it's released before and after. And then when like a month later, something comes up, does anyone"
2549.82,2554.62," even care, you know? I mean, they even care beyond the time thing that they just want to look at the"
2555.58,2557.98," score, right? I was thinking about that in terms of, uh,"
2559.02,2564.8599999999997," grand theft.o4, which, you know, what is it like off the map already? It's just thing"
2564.8599999999997,2570.06," was like the greatest things slice bread, right? Six weeks ago. I think a lot have any of us finished it."
2570.06,2573.98," I have other than Anthony who's right in the gut, a strategy guy. So that's different. I'm not."
2573.98,2579.98," And now I'm having a hard time going back to it, honestly. Yeah, I quit when I said I suspected I would"
2580.3,2586.94," back then. I, I, I, I, I was enjoying it tremendously. Everything I was playing, but I lost the thread there."
2586.94,2591.02," Yeah, I lost it throughout. I tried picking it up and pretty much spent a play session just like"
2592.22,2596.3," dating people. Like that had that were giving me thumbs down to getting the random,"
2596.3,2599.5," I was doing the relationship grind basically. It's like, oh crap. I've got to go"
2600.14,2604.62, date the following three people because otherwise I could lose my taxi privileges. And then I didn't
2604.62,2609.18," progress anything and then I was like, what was dumb? Yeah, I didn't want to go bowling. I wanted to shoot"
2609.2599999999998,2617.3399999999997," people. Well, I've been playing a lot of Mass Effect for the PC and just on the spoiler thing,"
2618.46,2623.1," I'm really glad that even the scheme came out when did it come out for Xbox,"
2623.1,2628.8599999999997, I feel like a year ago. Here I go. I know not that long. Heading me. It just came out this last holiday.
2628.8599999999997,2633.2599999999998," See, I was like, no, yeah, feels like six months or so. I feel like a year. I think. Yeah,"
2633.34,2637.82, maybe not. It's just came out this last holiday. It's game time. It's a year. All right. So half a year.
2639.82,2645.6600000000003, But I between all the previews and everything and their views that came out. I guess I never
2645.6600000000003,2651.0200000000004, managed to avoid all spoils. And I'm glad now because I'm far enough into it and I started actually
2651.0200000000004,2657.1000000000004, really getting into the story like much more so than I thought I would. That now I want to know what's
2657.1,2662.86, going to happen on my own because I'm now invested in the story and I would be annoyed if I had
2662.86,2667.3399999999997," read a reviewer's spoiler. Right. But what about when you're done, though? When I'm done, of course,"
2667.3399999999997,2671.66," I would totally want to do this. Yeah. I mean, I guess there's the established it where you're like,"
2671.66,2676.7," this is what like if this is the kind of reviewer could take that this, you know, and you get people"
2676.7,2682.14," used to that idea. They know to stay away from it until they. Yeah. In fact, when I'm done,"
2682.14,2686.46, then I would like to read something like that. Right. And you couldn't you wouldn't go to the
2686.54,2690.86, standard video game site review then to find that conversation. You're right. I wouldn't find
2690.86,2695.42," that conversation. I would find out that it had fluid controls and that thing, you know. And that"
2695.42,2698.7," was part of my point. Like I don't wait. We didn't not just because we were working a building,"
2698.7,2703.66, but like you said you didn't read in your reviews for it. And I read one because someone had pointed
2703.66,2710.2200000000003," to me for other reasons. But again, you know, having just being really odd, having certain things"
2710.2200000000003,2714.7," about it, I don't want to say anymore. But it's like, yeah, I really don't think that people go"
2714.7799999999997,2719.8999999999996, to reviews for the purpose that a lot of people who write reviews assume their audiences turn to
2719.8999999999996,2724.8599999999997," what they write. You know, I mean, and that's data purposes that we are here to inform consumers"
2724.8599999999997,2729.74," and to help educate them on their on their bonding decisions. But I mean, let's consider that now"
2729.74,2737.18, we've got an era where people download demos all the time. They pre-order games oftentimes
2737.18,2742.06, before they read and they any review. So that's sort of like they don't need advice. They're
2742.06,2747.42," already made their decision. They have discussions on message boards and, you know, word them out"
2747.42,2753.98, with one another that are far more intimate and able to respond directly to one another than
2753.98,2758.06, whatever Joe Blow one of us says on the other side of what just doing some regular thing.
2759.18,2763.18," And I think even when you say, well, yeah, but you're talking about a specific type of person."
2763.18,2766.86," You're talking about the hardcore gamer. And I think if you go beyond that, I think it's still"
2766.94,2772.2200000000003," holds true for whoever you imagine, Joe Blow that doesn't do much of anything, you know,"
2773.02,2776.94," as far as the hardcore stuff. It doesn't go to any websites or anything. I mean, there's just so"
2776.94,2782.86, many ways to make up your mind that I think that it's kind of a reaction. It's kind of like a defense
2782.86,2788.46," mechanism. Like, well, even Jeff Kersman of giant bomb from a native game spot, he was talking to"
2789.1800000000003,2793.7400000000002," Steven Tato, drop in Tony names here at once, but of MTV multiplayer blog. And he was saying,"
2793.74,2799.2599999999998," what I do at the end of the day, I look at my job as being to say, can I say people money?"
2799.2599999999998,2803.8199999999997," That's how I tackle it review. And what I read that was it's kind of like this delusion,"
2803.8199999999997,2808.7," but the reason it's there is that, well, there was a time when him and people like him and"
2808.7,2812.9399999999996, ourselves were kind of these gatekeepers to gaming. We were there. We were the ones that had the
2812.9399999999996,2817.3399999999997, access and people would to count on us for this go ahead and buy it or go ahead and don't. And it's
2817.3399999999997,2823.66," like, people don't anymore. It's kind of like just lined yourself to make it. So you feel like"
2823.66,2827.8199999999997," that there's still some merit to what you're doing. And my, you know, my response would be to go"
2827.8199999999997,2830.8599999999997," the other direction. That's why I'm talking about, you know, the critique and stuff like that."
2831.5,2836.7," But I mean, yeah, if you look at any review on a website, the comments are usually people who have"
2836.7,2841.98," played it and either agree or disagree with your review. So obviously, right, you know, that's the kind"
2841.98,2845.8999999999996," of person you're attracting or they haven't played it, but they're like, they're agreeing, I already"
2845.8999999999996,2850.7," agree. This is a plus. So you're an idiot for giving a preview at the score, basically."
2850.7799999999997,2854.54, Yeah. And that's worth. Yeah. That's like a question we're asking in because people are clearly
2854.54,2858.9399999999996," still reading reviews that doesn't mean that that their reviews as we don't work on, but what are they"
2858.9399999999996,2863.02," really reading? Well, don't eat. I think they're reading it in justification of exactly thought that"
2863.02,2866.7799999999997," they're, they think they're going to have about the game or I thought that they have had about the game."
2866.7799999999997,2872.7," Exactly. And do you want to be, I mean, then the questions, do you want to be the priest to some,"
2872.7,2876.8599999999997," someone on the internet's personal religion? I mean, if that's what they're looking for, right? They're"
2876.94,2882.06," looking, you know, they're looking for the priest for the church and whatever game acts or the"
2882.06,2885.82," other or someone to hate it, they're looking for someone to challenge it and say it goes both ways."
2885.82,2890.46," You know, finally someone's got through the bullshit. You know, suck in this game's dick, you know,"
2890.46,2897.58," I mean, you see that a lot. So the, the terms of these conversations you're talking about happen"
2897.58,2903.58," in a less way less structured fashion on the internet after the reviews come out. I mean,"
2903.58,2909.5," there is no place on necessarily one up where we have, we can post a post-mortem criticism,"
2909.5,2912.94," because kind of what you're talking about here and the kind, and this is the conversation you'd"
2912.94,2918.94," want after the fact, like I wouldn't want to read that before I got the game either."
2918.94,2922.7799999999997," Oh, yeah, of course. But I would love to read it after. Yeah, they're just, right, this is,"
2922.7799999999997,2928.2999999999997," like, we don't have that tag in the scene. We don't, but we could. We could, we could have"
2928.2999999999997,2931.74, been to do this on one of the stuff. That's not the idea. It means that I'm going to be chronically
2931.74,2935.2599999999998," laid on everything, but it's how it is anyway, right? I mean, we have like other podcasts and"
2935.2599999999998,2939.74," stuff, and it's like, it those are the ones you go to. You know, which is part of the reason why I"
2939.74,2943.9799999999996," stepped away from one of yours, and there's like nothing. It's just, it was pure, like I love the"
2943.9799999999996,2948.06," guys on the show. All it really has to do with the kind of fit. And also, you know, the main thing"
2948.06,2952.2999999999997, is just the time and stuff. But the fit is that I think a lot of people tend to into that show
2952.2999999999997,2956.7799999999997," to get the latest information and, you know, garden and chain or in a position with their, their roles"
2956.7799999999997,2960.9399999999996," in the company where they're always going to see these events. So instead of me going to see,"
2960.94,2966.54," like, the new, you know, kills on or something, I'll get to go to see some Russian games at one"
2966.54,2971.7400000000002," of C once in a while. And it's like, but I will tend to want to like really talk about something"
2971.7400000000002,2976.7000000000003," thoroughly when I've gotten the chance to do it, but but when that time comes, that audience doesn't"
2976.7000000000003,2983.58," give a fuck anymore. You know, so. Well, this is a real, I mean, this realization, you know,"
2983.58,2988.54," we had the viewpoint seconds, see, which is specifically, yes, we did. I bet this exact conversation"
2988.62,2993.58," is what spawned that. In fact, it is back when I think we were still C, GW weren't we for"
2993.58,2999.1," viewpoint. Yeah, it was one of one of those experiments that that we thought was awesome that"
2999.1,3004.22, ultimately failed. I don't know if it was the execution. If we were ahead of our time. If we were just
3004.22,3010.22," wrong headed or whatever, but that was when we dropped the review scores. We did no more scores. We said,"
3010.22,3016.62," okay, we're a print magazine in an internet world now. We're late. No matter what, in some cases,"
3016.7,3022.7, we're going to be eight weeks late. People are way done. So let's have the post-reviewed discussion.
3022.7,3027.58," Let's have that's what our instead of a review, that's what we'll do. We'll say, here's what"
3028.8599999999997,3034.14, here's what the discussion and reaction was to this game and our thoughts on top of it. And we're
3034.14,3038.8599999999997," not going to give you a score. And it could aggregate like the attitudes, you know, in perspectives"
3038.8599999999997,3042.54," of other reviewers. That's what we did. But what I wanted to, what would have been even cooler to"
3042.54,3047.34," go even more? And we did do some of this. I had quotes from message boards. Right. You know,"
3047.34,3052.06," to actually bring in the people that play these games, not for a quick stretch so they can"
3052.06,3056.7799999999997," collect a review check, but that people that are like invested in this and bring them into that"
3056.7799999999997,3060.7," conversation. And so you can have your own, and under that model, you could have your own perspective,"
3060.7,3067.58," but being informed by all these other perspectives. Yeah, I think it was a concept of it. I mean,"
3067.58,3072.3," was pretty fantastic. I mean, it was the kind of thing that you would need to run with for quite"
3073.02,3077.1000000000004," some time to develop the results that you want, because it's another way of writing for a lot of people,"
3077.82,3081.5," especially when we're coming out of a review. But I think we could have got there, but we just"
3081.5,3086.38," we'd put that we'd put down. We went back to reviews of the large majority of the feedback was like,"
3087.6600000000003,3091.5," they hated it. They hated it. No, we didn't, I mean, yes, I guess we did put that. And it was"
3092.1400000000003,3096.38," probably just because it's a never number of tests. Yeah, we were getting overwhelming go back to"
3096.38,3102.2200000000003," what you were doing. I didn't know. I didn't know. Yeah, because we didn't know. Yeah,"
3102.22,3107.98," because I mean, I look at our meal bag and I saw both of us. A lot of people that seem to be quite fond of it."
3109.02,3112.7799999999997, You don't focus on the score. It all focus that they wanted the number. And if you're either
3112.7799999999997,3116.9399999999996," they were on board and understood what we were doing, not having a score. Then we included scores from"
3116.9399999999996,3121.5," other publications. And then they were like, OK, so now you're giving everybody score, but you're on."
3121.8999999999996,3125.5, Why are you holding out on the score for us? Why don't you just add that way to better. How much
3125.5,3129.2599999999998, pace does it really take up in your magazine to put a number there? Just give us the number.
3129.42,3135.34," OK, so maybe you don't like it, but we do. Just tell us. That was overwhelming. It's all we got."
3135.34,3139.5," And it was just like, man, all the complaining people do about wanting something."
3139.5,3145.9," Well, our response was always like, well, you should read the text. And that a lot of people"
3145.9,3151.1000000000004," sort of interpreted that as being sort of sort of pompous. They thought it was, yeah, it was an arrogant"
3151.1000000000004,3154.5400000000004," well, they were a lot of your two did for numbers. There were a lot of different challenges there"
3154.5400000000004,3158.46," that got compounded. Because one solution might have been to where we could put a score back,"
3158.62,3163.34, but we don't have to change the methodology behind what we're doing. We could still
3164.06,3168.54, take into account all these other things that we're taking into account. And so there's different
3168.54,3174.54," angles of it that got conflated. And then there's a big thing. You have to like, it did mean for you,"
3174.54,3179.7400000000002," right? And I don't end you. It meant month, month after month, explain what this is and why we're trying"
3179.7400000000002,3184.38," to do it. Because of course, it's not like people are not used to this sort of thing as far as games go."
3184.38,3187.98," I think if we got to the point where we got it right, you know, and I was talking about, I really"
3188.06,3194.06," wanted to like, wanted to review multiple games in a single review. And I thought that like,"
3194.46,3198.06," area fit you on black side and and soldier fortune payback called it before, when it worked"
3198.06,3202.54, excellent that way. So I think readers of other non-gaming stuff would look at it immediately be
3202.54,3207.18," comfortable with it. Oh, yeah, I'm used to this format or something, but the game thing. It's so"
3207.18,3211.02," we're so used to it's the TV dinner thing. You know, it's like, you got your piece in the"
3211.02,3214.7, compartment. You got your dessert in the compartment and your salesberry steak in the other and you
3214.7,3218.7," got it, you like, you're going to eat the salesberry steak in the compartment and you better"
3218.7,3221.66," eat that and then you can move on to the piece and then you can get on the dessert. It's like,"
3221.66,3225.5, people are just so used to that that you put it like you try to put a proper meal in front of them.
3225.5,3230.14, They freak to fuck out. Right. It's so product-centric rather than like idea-centric. Yeah.
3231.74,3236.14, So we've got to have a little smell really diversion. We're talking about games. This is a
3236.14,3240.06, gaming podcast. Right. But leach we're talking about games. We're just realizing that these are
3240.14,3244.7799999999997, conversations that we've had probably every year. We've had them on the screen. We have them all the time.
3244.7799999999997,3250.46, I'm sure people are sick of a bitch and a bad game reviews. We're sick of writing them. So there you go.
3251.2599999999998,3256.46," Well, yeah, I'm not. I mean, I'm not talking about being absolutely delighted in writing."
3256.46,3260.7," This is sort of things talking about, you know, and it's kind of a nice,"
3260.7,3264.14," a slight coming up. This is something I really want to do. You know, what does it feel"
3264.22,3270.8599999999997," good? It's like, it's only like, for a lot of writers, you know, you said it's hard. There's only,"
3270.8599999999997,3276.62," there's not, not everybody can do that. You know, that was- Well, I think everyone can with,"
3276.62,3280.7799999999997," I mean, it just takes practice. You know, I mean, it's just like learning to do something differently,"
3280.7799999999997,3287.5, maybe. Right. I think you also need to see examples to understand that's key to how this is done.
3287.5,3292.2999999999997," Like, I mean, that's is how the voice of certain, you know, how reviews are written."
3292.38,3296.0600000000004," Right. You're an open over and over. Right. If you're a young, a young writer,"
3296.0600000000004,3302.46," and you're trying to break into this biz, and you go to 95% of the publications. Well,"
3302.46,3308.0600000000004, how you write a game review is this is like a five paragraph essay in junior high. When I started
3308.0600000000004,3313.1000000000004," here, the first review that I ever turned in, because I, you know, I've used to read a lot of"
3313.1000000000004,3319.82," like game spot or stuff. And our review that I came back to me, I was like, do you read a lot of"
3319.82,3324.78, web reviews because this is structured exactly like like one of these. Any healthfully told you to
3324.78,3331.34," read it. And that that single, you know, interaction like taught me quite a lot. Right."
3331.34,3337.1800000000003," Because I didn't know, you know, at the time. Yeah. Other things like I do, I think with practice"
3337.1800000000003,3341.5800000000004," writing, you know, like seminar papers and stuff like that. I mean, if you're used to that kind of thing,"
3341.5800000000004,3347.1800000000003," which sounds totally boring, but it can be as fun and as, you know, wacky as you want, but it's like the whole trick"
3347.8199999999997,3351.8999999999996," is knowing that you're never just going to say, well, I'm going to give my two cents on this."
3351.8999999999996,3355.98," And as if it's an evacuation, as though you're going to just pretend that there aren't like,"
3355.98,3360.3799999999997," you know, 10,000 more intelligent people than yourself more together than yourself,"
3360.3799999999997,3364.7," we've already voiced their opinions. So what you then do is you take and you survey them,"
3364.7,3369.18," you bring them in, you have a discussion with them, but you still maintain your own point of view."
3369.18,3373.98," And that's the trick is that you're not just then summarizing what other people think,"
3373.98,3378.94, but you're distinguishing your own perspective. In comparison and contrast with all of these other
3378.94,3383.66," voices and that, I think, is a trick that that probably takes practice. But I think it's something that everyone can do."
3385.5,3388.94," Before we go on, I know Jeff, you got some Conan stuff, but do you want to like,"
3389.58,3393.9," want to say something about the, the Nvidia execs comments about the state of PC gaming?"
3394.94,3399.58," Yeah, let's see. You got grab this thing off NeoGafs after noon. Some rise up. Well, no,"
3399.58,3405.34," the sources are technical. Okay. Sorry. It was technical. Right. It was, I think we got the link from"
3405.34,3412.62," via the, via the graph. So, so Roy Taylor in videos VP of content business development spoke with"
3412.62,3418.22," uh, ours technical is Ben Kuchera. And he had some interesting some comments. I mean, some of"
3418.22,3423.5, some of these are bolded if you want to go through them. And I know we were sort of surprised with a
3423.5,3432.3," fuel vom and right, um, right. Let's see. I can go. I got got through it. He was basically saying that"
3433.02,3439.5, he imagines a future of PC gaming is being the place where console games come to be refined.
3440.14,3445.18, This is opposed to games originating on on PC and then moving to console or being developed
3445.18,3449.58," simultaneously for all platforms. But kind of like the case, like what you're with, with, with"
3449.58,3455.18," mass effect and gears or work where these special additions come out. And he says that, you know,"
3455.18,3459.18," he's, he specifically cites the Assassin's Creed and gears of war saying that they began"
3459.18,3462.94, in consoles and it became better when they reported to the PC with features like improved graphics
3462.94,3467.5, and level editors. And he says that the consoles will basically be the proving ground for titles
3467.5,3471.5," before they come to PC, which means fewer games will be built from the ground up to take advantage"
3471.5,3478.38," of what PC can do. And he says, um, well, I think that, I mean, that's, let's stop there. Yeah,"
3478.46,3483.1," I mean, first of all, that comment itself strikes me as like half bizarre and half retarded."
3483.1,3491.82," I mean, because for, okay, let's start with the low hanging fruit. Did,"
3491.82,3495.7400000000002, were gears of war and Assassin's Creed actually better on the PC just because they had a
3495.7400000000002,3502.06," level editor or higher graphics? No. I mean, the fact is, at least I'd in play Assassin's Creed on"
3502.06,3507.02, either. Let's read it. But let's say gears of war. Here's a war was a better experience on the
3507.1,3511.34, console because it's a console game. It played better. I played play both. I played them both to
3511.34,3519.02," completion. And I can say unequivocally in my opinion, that it played much better on the Xbox,"
3519.02,3525.18," because it was made to be played with a controller. And so what's better, you know, how do you"
3525.18,3529.98," define, how do you say it's better on the PC just because I mean, maybe this is what happens when"
3529.98,3533.58, you work in Nvidia that you're looking at everything from a graphics point of view as opposed
3533.58,3541.02," like a gaming point of view. But to me, it was a worse experience on the PC. And so just, if you"
3541.02,3546.46," start with this, that one piece of that one thing he's saying, then the whole rest of it falls apart."
3546.46,3551.9," I mean, the console version was a first draft of the game. It became on the PC. Let's look at"
3551.9,3557.9, the PC was like a mangled version of what was pretty perfect in the first place on the other platform.
3557.9,3562.06," Well, let's look at Mass Effect for a second. Because that's a game by where his made PC role playing"
3562.14,3569.1, is important. Mass Effect to me felt very much like all the design was done because they knew
3569.1,3572.7," it was going to be a console game. So when they bring it to PC, they do make some good changes."
3572.7,3577.9," Yeah. But at no point, you think this is the game they would have made if they had started on the"
3577.9,3582.46, PC. There would have been some fundamental differences. Yeah. I think control them how things
3582.46,3588.54, exactly handled. I'm really digging Mass Effect on the PC a lot. I really like the
3589.18,3593.02, tactical overlay that they've added. I don't know if you guys have seen it. Yeah. I think it's
3593.02,3598.46," literally considered better than the Xbox 3 right. But like you said, there's certain things like"
3598.46,3602.54, the inventory system and stuff like that that I think would have to have been totally designed
3602.54,3608.38, differently if it had started on the PC in the first question. And it feels clued to me. It doesn't
3608.38,3614.38, feel right. Right. Exactly on the PC. So I know that's just like one angle of what he's saying.
3614.46,3619.34," But some cases, I will say I can something just happened recently where it made me imagine that"
3619.34,3625.1, a console game could come to the PC. I'd like it a lot more. And that's about to feel bad
3625.1,3629.1, company. I can't say much about it. We're still waiting for the embargo to come up. But I
3629.1,3633.58," did like the multiplayer a lot to the point that at the whole time I'm playing, I'm like, God,"
3633.58,3638.86," I wish this was on PC. And part because the Xbox live environment is not as, you know,"
3638.86,3645.34, attracted to me is that my inventory will environment with with my people. And the interface for a
3645.34,3651.1," shooter like that. But for years of war, part of the reason I liked that and did play Xbox on Xbox"
3651.1,3657.5, live for quite some time despite not liking that in that play space was because it worked so well
3657.5,3661.5," with the interface that I never was like, God, I wish I had to control, I mean, a mouse and keyboard"
3661.5,3665.98," when I played it. But it was like, yeah, with that field, it kind of makes sense because dice"
3666.06,3670.54," they've made PC shooters for the longest time. And like, God, if they made this, this would be"
3670.54,3674.94," fantastic. I can imagine playing the hell out of this on PC if they did it. So I'm like,"
3674.94,3680.3, there are circumstances where I would definitely do our cases where it matters. And I think like
3680.3,3686.06," you're saying, I did play a little bit of mass effect on the 360. And I couldn't get my head around"
3686.06,3693.02," it at the time. Mostly weirdly for me, it was like a content thing. Like, I, when I'm playing my"
3693.1,3699.2599999999998," Xbox 360, my head, I want more something like a little more visceral and faster. It's just the space,"
3699.2599999999998,3704.06, my head is in. So when I start playing it and you get to the citadel and it slows down for a while
3704.06,3708.62," there, when you're at that place. Right. And this is like, this is not what I want to do on where"
3708.62,3713.74," it's the old tab for your A-M window or exactly. And then now on the PC, I'm back in, I'm like in a"
3713.74,3718.14, comfort zone there. Like the slow pace is actually appealing to me. And I'm taking my time because
3718.14,3723.18, all the side you're open on the small chair. I can't fault the task here and you're not wrong.
3724.46,3728.2999999999997," Those long elevator rides can go so slow. So yeah, I think there are cases. Yeah, God, what is"
3728.2999999999997,3734.14," with all the elevator? It's how they mask loading. It's such, it's like the elevator game."
3734.14,3738.94," I guarantee that no matter how bad it is on your PC, it was worse on the really. Yeah, it was."
3738.94,3741.66," If you watch my YouTube, it was called mask effect."
3742.62,3749.66, I'm liking it a little less elevator time would be. It'd be great. Thanks.
3749.66,3757.74," Yeah, this one, his quote here, Taylor's quote, this, that's something that people need to get their"
3757.74,3765.18," heads around. The PC is going to be an improved version. It's just like, why do I have to get my"
3765.18,3770.2999999999997," head around that? You're wrong. Like in some cases, maybe you can't make a blanket statement like that."
3770.38,3774.6200000000003," Some in some cases, the console versions always going to be better. Always every because"
3774.6200000000003,3777.02, that was a console game. It's about to say everything. It's about to say everything about
3777.02,3777.98, the game. It's about to say it's about to say it's about to say it's about to say it's about to
3777.98,3782.1400000000003," go for a last plan. Look at how definitive a statement that is to the one he says today,"
3782.1400000000003,3788.94," developing a PC game is mean starting on a console. Yeah, for a spokesperson for in Vedia to be saying"
3788.94,3794.46," this because the graphic is, you know, the chip makers is not for traditionally the most defensive. Yes,"
3794.46,3797.98," they're the ones that form, you know, the PC gaming lines isn't stuff and they're they're the ones"
3798.06,3802.54," they're always to say, you know, like in this case, Rob did send me a message after,"
3802.54,3807.42," first published the battlefield hero story. You know, it was talking about crisis sales and he was,"
3807.42,3810.62," you know, really defense wanted to remind me that well, you know, crisis is now,"
3810.62,3815.5," this time has gone on is selling really well. And so for him to be making this statement,"
3816.22,3820.62," it is kind of alarming. But at the same time, it doesn't address, it was like, well,"
3820.62,3825.34, battlefield heroes. That kind of game. Right. Or the wonderful was it guy online? What did you say?
3825.34,3830.1400000000003, It was what guy? I don't know. You're your gate. Something gate. You're okay. Okay.
3830.1400000000003,3834.46, You're okay. Sorry. Sorry. They kind of gave me a box of this game. It could be great.
3834.46,3840.3, But there were there are still games that developing a PC games means developing a PC game.
3840.3,3846.2200000000003," Of course it does. And beyond that, too, like we just went, I just went to this one C event last week"
3846.2200000000003,3851.42," and they showed, they had like eight or nine PC games and all, they were also announcing that they had some"
3851.5,3857.5, console games. They were definitely about putting a bunch of new product on PC.
3858.06,3864.06," Exactly. So even if it's not North Americans, you know, premier studios that are making just for"
3864.06,3869.1800000000003," their still places in the world that are in their still are. And there's still entire genres that are,"
3869.1800000000003,3875.42," I mean, God, we don't have to have the defend is PC gaming. Yeah, but it's not, but it's like this,"
3875.7400000000002,3882.7000000000003," this representative like for Nvidia axes started to like drink the cool aid, you know, a little bit."
3883.42,3891.34," The other comment here. I quote, I think we have to, it was you have to say the facts."
3891.34,3895.66, The value of consoles is such that no one is going to make a PC exclusive game in the future.
3895.66,3900.94," Why would they? Why would they ignore consoles? What would happen? Again, it's a like a discussion."
3901.02,3905.26," It went from like your girl's fat. You know, it's like, do you just not fat? She's not fat. You're"
3905.26,3911.98," girl is fat. I girl's got big titties like that. That's what I'm into. Yes, that's it."
3914.2200000000003,3921.66," Enhanced, hence the expanded content. Right. Right. Yeah, this is better. My girlfriend's the enhanced version."
3921.66,3925.26," Yeah, that's your girlfriend. Plus now with silicone."
3926.0600000000004,3931.0200000000004," So yeah, that's the only use anymore that you say."
3933.0200000000004,3936.3," Yeah, I mean, I think it's just the blanket nature of that state."
3936.3,3943.98," There's something that's what's bothering me. It's just like, okay, yes, certain, certain types of games will"
3943.98,3951.5," probably now be generated on the console first, but there's whole. Right. And if there's a civilization five"
3951.5,3956.78, F from that saying when for access is not going to be designing this thing on the consoles and
3956.78,3963.66," importing it to PC, they will make that game on the PC to run on PCs. I guarantee you, Blizzard's"
3963.66,3968.46," next game is going to get designed on the PC. Why would they ignore consoles, though? Right."
3969.58,3974.06," Tell me Jeff, this doesn't make any sense. Ask him. Well, this is the case. Actually, a Starcraft"
3974.06,3979.42, 2 is being designed for console. And the PC one is going to have extra stuff to have life
3979.7400000000002,3984.78," episode 3 is also being designed for console. We'll have a few PC bonuses. Right. Oh, these are exclusive"
3984.78,3991.1," scripts by the way. Yeah. So, so now. Yeah. So yeah, of course the other thing here is that it's a"
3991.1,3996.14," lot of ignoring Blizzard and Valve and other studios as well. Even if you know, Valve is making"
3996.14,4000.38, right and how can you. They are Valve and Blizzard. If you want to make PC game statements.
4001.58,4006.06," Yeah, it's not it's not a case that team fortress was developed for console and it just happens to have"
4006.14,4012.14, all the real red stuff on PC right now. Right. They as developed for PC has all the red stuff on PC and
4012.14,4016.7," it happens to also be on console. I mean, so it's not they will go both directions"
4017.42,4023.9," or long time in the future. And so it's indeed true get quick notes. Sciops, mine gate"
4023.9,4028.7, conspiracies on file plan it for free. I wrote that down just because I was talking about it a week or so ago.
4028.7,4035.34," It's pretty fun game. It's a it's a fun game. Fun game. So you guys still playing Conan? Yeah, I have"
4035.34,4040.7000000000003," a quick Conan announcement to make too. Oh yeah, yeah, it's not important to anybody here."
4040.7000000000003,4046.38, You gotta pay that. You just had everyone that's members of Pino Orange. Uh-oh. We have our guild city.
4048.2200000000003,4053.26," Right now we have is the keep in like three walls that aren't completed. Three walls. Yeah,"
4053.26,4059.02, you can get built. I helped you. So you build one wall. So it's like a golden half per section of
4059.02,4063.82, wall. And so you build an outer keep wall. And then you build all your buildings like stores. And then
4063.9,4068.54, you have to build the or maybe we're building in or keep wall. You build your buildings. Then you have to have an
4068.54,4075.9, outer keep wall. But all this shit cannot happen without everyone contribute. Uh-oh. So you here to collect money.
4075.9,4079.6600000000003," Yeah, we're talking about. Yeah, we're talking about. You need to get the next."
4079.6600000000003,4083.7400000000002, It's coming to the next time you're on getting guild chat and say who can I give money to for the
4083.7400000000002,4088.78," guild bank? Yeah, just fucking extortion. I'm in people. I'm not even saying I'm not even saying"
4088.78,4095.42," it has to be a lot. I'll have got us about to 10. 10 goes a long way when it's everyone though. Yeah, shit."
4095.42,4099.58," You need to donate. Fuck this game. But, Rory, what do I get out of pink?"
4099.58,4104.46," I'm just like, what do I get a wall? The three walls? That's not going to keep out the barbarian"
4104.46,4109.5, animal. And actually our keep is like you can see from the top of our keep. Really they're keeping
4109.5,4114.7, the distance. Damn. So what do we get? What do I get if I pay taxes? What do I get in the keep?
4114.78,4119.0199999999995, I get our protection for one and you've needed it. You just have failed to request it. When you were in
4119.0199999999995,4125.82," white stands, you were getting your ass beat over it. Yeah, it's protection. You could have said,"
4125.82,4131.099999999999," you got a nice family gift. Did you get a shame if anything happened to him? You could have said,"
4131.099999999999,4136.3," Pino inch clan. This is Jeffrey G. Exactly. I mean, white stands getting a shit beat out of me."
4136.3,4141.5, Uh-huh. A symbol. And you would have had so many beats there to help to help you out. All right.
4141.58,4145.9," Then you would have been the one beating the shit out of me. Okay. I get that part, but I get that part."
4145.9,4149.82, But what about the keep though? So you got to pay for that. So I can see paying for protections.
4149.82,4153.42," But what about the keep? We have that's what the, that's what money goes towards is the keep. Yeah,"
4153.42,4157.02," we have, what do I do in the keep? We have why do I want to? You don't you stay alive. We chill in the"
4157.02,4165.02, keep. Watch DVDs. I'm actually on the phone. I forgot there. There is things you can do with the
4165.02,4171.02, keep that are totally like in the long term like beneficial to everyone. Like you get special powers
4171.02,4174.620000000001, when you're keep reaches a certain level. Like everyone in the guild does or something like that.
4174.620000000001,4178.3," It's what I was told. But is it like a, so it's a physical, it's a place in the place."
4178.3,4182.14," You like that you would go to. You can go there now and I get. Yeah, you can go there."
4182.14,4186.860000000001," Yeah, when you walls. Whenever you're traveling like on one of those things, it's like take the boat to this"
4186.860000000001,4191.580000000001, place. Okay. There will be a thing that says travel to guild city. And just instant travel to your guild city.
4191.66,4197.9, We can dance in there. Maybe from just chill. Like it's a place to call our own and we'll eventually have to fight it.
4197.9,4202.7," Yeah, it's fight to defend it because other people can take it over. Yeah, like we'll let Anthony's job. So"
4202.7,4208.86," while you have to pay, like people last week flung a rotted cow corpse that had bubonic plague to"
4208.86,4213.18," keep and Anthony's job is to run around the, in the between the internal gate and the external gate"
4213.18,4218.54, and fling the cows back. So he does this. So he doesn't have to pay the tin. So you pay the tin.
4218.54,4223.1, So we can pay Anthony to get rid of the corpse that doesn't exist because I'm making it.
4225.1,4233.58, Excited. That's not so cool. There are things like like if you make your keep doesn't have to be open to attack.
4234.22,4238.7," But if you make your keep open to attack, you earn income for your keep doing that."
4238.7,4243.98, So it can keep you keep it destroyed. Yeah. So if we made our keep like if we made our keep like vulnerable
4243.98,4248.3," to attack like Monday through Friday, we would get a ton of money. Whereas if we made it"
4248.3,4252.62," only like a tackle on Wednesday nights, it wouldn't be. So then are we going to need a dude sitting"
4252.62,4258.62, there like lock with the numbers like what? Punch your man. Basically we need someone to
4258.62,4262.860000000001," Anthony, but your tin goes to paying. We need someone sitting on the keep just being like,"
4262.860000000001,4266.78," I can see people. Anthony, number three in the morning with those pillow and his hair."
4266.78,4271.18, Blow the horn like the recoil of guy. You pretty cool. And then all the sudden like everyone just
4271.18,4277.26," like ports to our town and gets ready to fight. If it, if the, if the thing gets, the"
4277.34,4282.54," keep gets destroyed, it's like gone with like a money. I donated. It's like fucked. Yes. I'm so"
4282.54,4287.34," not paying. You got to, you got to make a macro. It hex everybody's self-phone. I'm not paying."
4287.34,4291.58, Unless I'm guaranteed my investment is guaranteed. You got to fuck by. You got to get burger and
4291.58,4297.02, I get black your saying it's going to turn on. I need to talk to my lawyers. All right. You're
4297.02,4301.74, going to get everyone hooked up with black. What you do? Yes. I say let's change this right now.
4301.82,4306.86, Let's say your character name. You are on the tyranny. I'm on the tyranny. P.V. P.
4306.86,4312.38, P. Server. I'm Lamax. I'm I don't mind saying. And that's L. U M M O X. Yeah. And I'm saying this because
4312.38,4317.26," I don't want you to be in these positions where you're, you're just been playing solo. Well,"
4317.26,4321.26," I playing this game on your own. I'm level 20 now. I'm out in the world. See, that was the other"
4321.26,4327.74, finished tort tortage. So the only reason that there's been other players in this world is just to
4327.74,4333.099999999999, beat you down. But I only got beat down a couple times. I got beat down a couple times and the
4333.099999999999,4338.86, under he need to feel what it's like to do. It's a game. It's a game. It's build on beat a couple of
4338.86,4346.62," primus and a fiction about being a brutal warlord in the the purpose in life. As Conan said,"
4347.66,4353.58, which was a depth. That's King Conan to you. Genghis Khan is basically to be fools down.
4353.66,4358.78, Okay. But here's here's the thing. I played through the first 20 levels. The Tortado stuff. A lot of
4358.78,4363.66," that the night time stuff, which, you know, people been up and down on. I actually ended up"
4364.38,4370.3," enjoying it. I did. I liked the solo. I mean, it's not the world's greatest story or anything."
4370.3,4376.78, And there's a lot of. I still haven't read a lot of things. I've done more skipping in the later.
4376.78,4383.5, I read a lot of it. Yeah. I made me feel bad about yourself. Yeah. I read. I read most of it.
4383.58,4390.38," I mean, it was fine. I put that on once I got once I sailed off to my homeland and then got"
4390.38,4397.42, faced with like 25 new exclamation points from all the NPCs in front of me. It was like my soul just
4397.42,4401.74," got sucked away. I just like looked at those, all those people have logged off. I was like, oh no, I"
4401.74,4408.22, don't want to fetch all your shit. Yeah. I'm done now. And this is this is the difference. Like when I
4408.22,4413.42," got 20 and I got out of Tortado. I didn't go to my homeland at all. I immediately went, they,"
4413.5,4420.46," I followed, followed, rode and dunk in and they took me to a whole another area and there were fewer"
4420.46,4426.06," items. This is what? Can we? No, no, no. Why does this a lot to? No, I'll land the desert one."
4426.06,4430.86," Can we? Can we? Yeah. Yep. That's our reference. Yeah, it comes up. So we just went out there and"
4430.86,4435.9," there are fewer things to do. But basically the first, the first act is like, let's just start killing"
4435.9,4439.9800000000005," people that are like turning into Quest. So you don't want to be the guy who's like, oh, shit,"
4439.98,4443.58, there's 20 exclamations. I got to go get them all. You want to be the guy that's like killing the
4443.58,4448.78, dude who's looking at the exclamations. Yeah. And that makes all the difference in the world. Right.
4448.78,4453.179999999999," This game. Right. Well, that means you, that's a difference. That's not Conan. What you're doing."
4453.179999999999,4458.0599999999995," It's not Pino Orange and it's not Conan. I'm not living the Pino into life. It's, you know,"
4458.0599999999995,4463.179999999999," I saw some guys arguing in the Pino in the guilt chat. It was great. I had just logged on. I got,"
4463.179999999999,4466.86," I logged on right in the middle of an argument because as soon as I logged on, you know,"
4466.86,4471.9," the green text, I see just up on the screen. Like, you fucking doosh. Fuck you. And then, you know,"
4471.9,4477.5," I was like, oh, wow. What's this about? I think it turns out that one dude in the guilt, like,"
4477.5,4481.9," ganked another dude in the guilt. He's like, dude, you even see my fucking Ted. That was yesterday."
4482.46,4485.98," Oh, this was a couple days. Oh, it's like a same happened to Duncan. But that ain't Pino."
4485.98,4491.9," But it made me think offline. Like, maybe that is Pino. Yeah. Maybe Pino does not discriminate."
4491.9,4497.179999999999," Well, I remember one time Sean saved some guy that was being attacked by mobs and running."
4497.179999999999,4500.54," And Rory was like, what the fuck you doing? Yeah, this is that is not told."
4500.54,4504.0599999999995," Oh, that's what I thought. I just did it. It was both a Jeff. Exactly."
4505.42,4507.9, This is actually the story I'm alluding to.
4507.9,4513.259999999999," Oh, no, but I also had things where, you know, I'll run into people in our guilt and no hide for me"
4513.259999999999,4517.58," because they expect me to try to kill over something. But, um, is that culture? I just, series."
4517.58,4521.66, I don't do that. A Pino in control. I kill somebody else in Pino Orange and not Pino
4521.66,4527.18, Orange has gotten so like indiscriminate. I think I don't handle it. Like most people don't know who I'm in.
4527.18,4529.98, I'm on there. I was on the weekend. No one ever says hi or anything.
4529.98,4533.82," Oh, beisha. And I ask people, are there any like level 30ish people who want to do, you know,"
4533.82,4536.78," the parameter, the black ass or something, no one ever responds?"
4536.78,4540.62," And I think they just got a bunch of people in there and you asked me, like, well, how did you"
4540.62,4543.74," get in here? They're like, well, we just heard this is a good ganking build or something. So it's not like"
4544.62,4547.9, podcast listeners and stuff. And they routinely started kicking people out for
4548.54,4553.66," grave sins such as saying, you know, for the wind and what is it? QQ was. Any of that?"
4553.66,4559.74," I heard that discussion. QQ is an automatic. Yeah. And so someone the other day was like,"
4559.74,4563.9," we just, we're just we're looking in the chat and we see like in grit, gild green. Like,"
4563.9,4567.74," I've got more PvP in my little finger than you've gotten your entire body. It was like,"
4568.0599999999995,4575.179999999999, man. I don't want to read that shit. That's not pretty much. Everybody invented rules like
4575.179999999999,4578.94, everything that's over the world. That's also given us your money and shut the fuck up.
4578.94,4584.94," Yeah. Well, it's so bragging about their PvP. Like, for one, you don't talk to other people in the"
4584.94,4589.0199999999995," guild, like some kind of dumbass. And then like, the moment it goes your head and you think that like"
4589.98,4594.78," you're stupid ass, Conan and character. Yeah, that's definitely always my favorite part of all"
4594.86,4602.78, Emma much chat. Like the O.C. chat in Conan is worse than Barren's chat and wow. And it's just all
4602.78,4607.099999999999," these guys like, yeah, doing the E-peen thing with their. And it's like, do you realize what you're"
4607.099999999999,4612.78," doing here? No, it's just so ridiculous. Yeah. And there's a lot of what I find amusing is like,"
4612.78,4617.82," there's so much wow hate. You know, there's so much like, oh, this game's a million times better than"
4617.82,4621.98," wow. Wow. Wow. It's actually a forbidden topic in our guild. Right. But it's like,"
4621.98,4627.099999999999, I'm from. Do you know how much this game actually owes to wow? This game wouldn't be here without wow.
4627.099999999999,4632.86," Three forces of the design is wow. You know, Lochowers the same way. Lochowers the same way in the"
4632.86,4638.299999999999," attitude was the same way. That drew me nuts and Lochow. Like, oh, yeah, let's go back to your kitty game."
4639.099999999999,4643.419999999999," We're we're playing Lord of the Rings one. Yeah, Lord of the Rings. Yeah, Lord of the Hobbits. Yeah,"
4643.419999999999,4649.82," go to your care. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Holy. So that even like Rory and Met and James and"
4649.9,4654.38," Duncan get kind caught up in that. Like, I've seen them like they've done the same as anyone. Like,"
4654.38,4657.82," if they get beat to like dude, I'm getting my all. I'm getting my out. And you're like, come on. Like,"
4657.82,4663.099999999999, let's just do this quest and like you can't talk them out of it. They got to go prove that they've got like
4663.099999999999,4666.94," a bigger gun somewhere in their gun closet, even though you caught them out in the yard at the 38th"
4666.94,4673.179999999999," specialty. They do have an elephant rifle in their closet. No, they'll bring it out. I mean, you understand"
4673.179999999999,4679.42," the need for revenge. Well, right? Any game in my way. You know, the other thing about this, the"
4679.42,4683.82," thing that's disturbing me most about the game. And I suspect it's probably, you know, common"
4683.82,4690.3," to all of them and Moses. Like, we can't play together. I mean, there's kind of like a cast system"
4690.3,4695.02," based on your levels. And while you can apprentice people and stuff, he just doesn't work. Like, so if"
4695.02,4699.18," someone's like three or four levels above me, they don't want to play with me because or I don't"
4699.18,4703.18, want to play with them because I'm not going to get the XP doing the stuff that I would normally
4703.18,4707.42," do. People underneath don't want to do it. Same thing when you apprentice them, then it's just"
4707.5,4711.42, feels like more bullshit. And it's like the whole thing is just to rank up. And the best ways to do
4711.42,4716.54," it is never to play with people that are outside of your cast. Yeah. And every game is like,"
4716.54,4720.78," I play the game because I want to play with other people. Right. So like, everyone in our guild,"
4720.78,4725.18," the people whose names I keep mentioned, they're like three and four characters now. And like they'll"
4725.18,4729.82, they'll pass like I just got the 34 and they made these new characters because it turns out that the
4729.82,4734.9400000000005," 10th is set and priest of me, charred like radically overpowered and they proven that now. They,"
4735.0199999999995,4741.0199999999995," but they hit like 30 in like it in after noon. It was like, what you're on your fourth build in like"
4741.0199999999995,4747.339999999999," you're now like, yeah, you can quest with me on my main. And we're all nodding knowingly around Sean."
4747.339999999999,4753.0199999999995, Yep. Yeah. Like welcome to MMOs. But that's a problem. I mean isn't this like saying like you
4753.0199999999995,4756.62," go into someone's house, you're like, dude, there's a piece of shit in your living room. And"
4756.62,4762.94," everyone's like, yep. What do you have? That in our living room? How do you hear it a bit, dude?"
4763.0199999999995,4767.98," You know, we get like, why hasn't so and I mean, I want to be able to play with all of my friends and"
4767.98,4773.339999999999," have it still work out, even though they might be you know, higher level or lower level. Like just like,"
4773.339999999999,4779.0199999999995," we haven't both taken a year alone because we're like, right, you can. I'm level 20. Yeah. It's"
4779.0199999999995,4783.98," fucking stupid. That's what's going on. Man, I could man a plan more. I could man a plan more. But"
4783.98,4789.259999999999," I like I said I hit level 20 and then I just had this like sort of existential like, oh, yeah."
4790.22,4795.820000000001, The existential. I don't really know how the game or exclamation marks log off. Yeah. I don't really
4795.820000000001,4801.34," know how they could take care of that. Like an effective way to let people always group together,"
4801.34,4808.54," something. I don't know. I mean, the problem is yeah. I think it's a game to do that. Yeah. Don't make"
4808.54,4815.26, people have to level up. Yeah. Think of some other way that people can make a habit of playing
4815.26,4821.26," and almost long to suggest my own like, like, maybe suggested, but sure, something. There's there's"
4821.26,4827.74," gotta be a way around there. We don't have to live with that. Yeah. You buy a quick, you buy a level six"
4827.74,4832.7," character off of eBay. A real dollars for it. I mean, that's what every in the movies because that's"
4832.7,4837.58," whatever you really is. Because that's what we want. If I can't level up, what else am I going to do?"
4837.58,4841.900000000001," Oh, no. Well, I, I think that if you make some work, levels there, though. Yeah, because like, that's"
4841.98,4846.219999999999," all anyone's playing. Which is, uh, it should be noted that on the top of like the recent"
4846.219999999999,4851.74, additions to like yesterday's patch to Conan was we have now added a level sound for whenever you
4851.74,4857.5," live. Oh, yeah, after popular demands. Yeah. I'll let's say because it didn't. Oh, for I got to say,"
4857.5,4861.5, they got me in a good trick. I don't know if you've been to the series outside of the pyramid.
4861.5,4865.099999999999," It's called like the treasury of something. Some bullshit. Like when I say, don't read this game. I don't"
4865.099999999999,4867.9, read it. I don't. I don't read it. I don't read it. I don't read it. I don't read it. I don't
4867.9,4872.379999999999, the dialogue. I don't even read the name of the place that's I'm going. But I go in there and
4872.379999999999,4877.099999999999," they're like, okay, after we killed this boss, you see these vines in the wall. You climb up there."
4877.099999999999,4880.46," And that's where like we already did it, but you get, you know, there's usually some good, uh,"
4880.46,4885.82," like build specific. I mean, like class specific armor or weapon for you. So I climb this"
4885.82,4892.379999999999," fucking thing and like I fall through the world and like some boy is like, I's flailing and then"
4892.38,4897.26," they're all just laughing. Like, well, I guess like they did it to everyone. Oh,"
4897.26,4901.82," just thinking they know there's the void. Then bug from day one. So now you get, you get me all"
4901.82,4904.9400000000005," excited by the stuck out that you can climb here. I'm trying to remind of me, actually,"
4904.9400000000005,4910.3," they can climb here. My dad, like he, what I was really literally came back. He worked,"
4910.3,4914.14," works in Autobot and he comes back in this trunk of his beater and he's like,"
4914.7,4918.38," man, I got something for you in the trunk and he opens the trunk and there's like a,"
4918.38,4922.62," it's just like a paint can like, I was all excited. Like, you know, whatever dad brought me"
4922.62,4927.02, something and he puts a screwdriver to it and pops the thing and like a giant ass torrential
4927.02,4932.54," like comes out of my God. Okay. I just, I was so scared. I was terrified. I ran. What is that"
4932.54,4936.62, guy who was a president or was he trying to get a car of no or is he talking with me? So I
4936.62,4942.22, could think he was greafing me. And then he grew up to be a anchor. So what happened? That's
4942.22,4946.7," why I did the roots of John. I thought of this, so I go like, have I tapped all the, like, the"
4946.78,4950.46," possible connections of farting and video games, but I haven't because there's one more that"
4950.46,4955.9," came to mind and that was like one time when we were at, I was at Blockbuster video and you know how"
4955.9,4960.38, there's like racks on the very bottom and the whole video game is down there. But you have to like
4960.38,4965.099999999999, get down on your knees to read this stuff. So there's this little kid and he was like down there
4965.099999999999,4970.0599999999995, looking at the box for the game. So I just like stood right next to like I was getting something
4970.0599999999995,4973.98, and it turned as though we're gonna read and then my ass was in his face and I ripped it like a
4973.98,4980.0599999999995, tear fart on him just like a he farted on the little kid. Yeah and then he fell back the
4980.0599999999995,4983.74, red thing that was that he like fell back and caught him and he like caught himself with this hand
4983.74,4990.62, from fall all the way over and then like looked up like eyes. That was just like why did you do
4990.62,4994.62," a monster are you? Yeah, what are you doing? What did you do that? What did you do that? What's"
4994.62,4999.66," on it to that? Wasn't it just like last week? No, I wasn't like right after high school."
4999.66,5005.099999999999," You're now disciples, nerds go. I was. Dude, I right. We're ranking. That's what I"
5005.099999999999,5009.66, I get in trouble for that. I get to leveling but I always say I ranked because it's like that's
5009.66,5013.18, one used to saying a battlefield and stuff. But I ranked. I ranked in my nerd go
5013.18,5018.94," them when I told that story. Hey, hey, Roy, Roy told me that the developers are already fixing"
5018.94,5025.74," like popular, grieking tactics and such. Oh, is that right? Like there was some zone and I"
5025.74,5029.42, forget what he what it was but he told me that there was some zone where they would mess with
5029.42,5034.94, people and they made it like an instant zone. Hmm. Already. Because people were complaining about it.
5034.94,5038.46," Supposedly, I thought I was telling Roy last night and they do like two patches a week. So"
5038.46,5043.34," there's yeah, they're starting to raise a week. Yeah, they said they're going to slow down. Obviously"
5043.34,5049.0199999999995, when they when they can. I did find it interesting and kind of pleasant even if I was the
5049.0199999999995,5054.0599999999995," ganggy that even in that even in Tortage and sort of new area, once you get out of the city,"
5054.14,5058.3," I was surprised. You could be doing those quests and you could still get ganked. I mean,"
5059.02,5065.740000000001," I thought that was, you know, pretty, not hardcore of them, but, you know, just a good decision."
5065.740000000001,5070.14, It's a sort of make you have to deal with that right away. If the role with the role is too
5070.14,5074.22, quick. I think that's the way they differentiate themselves. Yeah. Yeah. That's the other thing.
5074.22,5078.780000000001, We'll institute a Pino-inch tax and then like a mandatory handholding like babysitting Jeff
5079.42,5084.7," to keep it in. Like, you're at the pro where you're about to own install. You sound like you're maybe like"
5084.7,5090.7," a Pino-inch from an uninstall. So I'm not an uninstall, but yeah, what no. So Pino-inch right. If you want Jeff"
5090.7,5094.0599999999995," around, you're going to have to like babysit him like that. That isn't going to keep me in. Think"
5094.0599999999995,5096.78, about in the world. Get the fuck away from me.
5098.38,5101.9, Good to have a minion. Yes.
5101.9,5106.62, And not one minions. I don't. That's why I have to create all of that. I don't get minions.
5106.94,5109.0199999999995," Yeah. There's a keep to be built, Jeff."
5110.7,5114.7, Oh yeah. That was what I know. We have to stop. And I was going to have to. So this keep thing. I
5114.7,5119.099999999999, could say you just spend the money and then it shows up or not. Do you see it being built?
5120.22,5125.74, You have to get like lobbies out there to like actually be built. I'm not sure. Like do I have to go over there?
5125.74,5130.7," Pick up a handhold. Right now if you go a little bit, you have to pull the wall. It has four towers"
5131.26,5135.82, a section of wall and then the beginnings of wall. So maybe it does have to be built. I don't know.
5136.62,5141.82, We're also after like roll a builder class and like hammer 12 hours. I made more builds.
5141.82,5147.34, Oh yeah. Star Wars. Yeah. Well you also realizing that we basically just like advertised it.
5147.34,5152.0599999999995, So for people to come into straw. Oh yeah. That's going to be a so in a modern need. Yeah. We really
5152.0599999999995,5155.099999999999, we really. We need a second. Honestly. I think that really is that you said this.
5155.099999999999,5158.3, Does your city like then show up on a map as like P Noron just city?
5159.0199999999995,5163.42, Yeah. Can it be orange or the walls P Noron? No. They're they're the same.
5163.42,5168.54, Is it have a name or is it just like name that someone comes by? Oh yeah. I wish I could live in a pumpkin too.
5171.26,5174.06, Does it have a name? Is it? Yeah.
5174.06,5177.74, It could also like defaults or something. No. I don't know if you weren't there. I don't think so.
5177.74,5183.42, Does we can't even put up like badass tags in the walls or something? It's like spray tags.
5183.42,5188.14, Yeah. I was thinking that would be so awesome. Because you imagine like the something awful
5188.14,5192.38, Goons would have like the ratestown in the whole game. Right. Like you know it would just be the most.
5192.38,5197.34, They'd have like for my wife dot W and B playing nonstop. Yeah. Right. In yield theater.
5198.62,5201.5, Second life. Explain that. Well they definitely do seem to
5201.5,5206.46," police this much less than while say in terms of that. Oh, yeah."
5209.02,5213.5, I'm not I'm not done. Well they got what was the shit we're like they rory got a
5214.46,5221.1, like a GM after them. The funny things about GMs in this game or maybe it's the thing about GMs in every game.
5221.1,5224.3," You guys once again have to inform me in my life. Yes, Sean."
5225.18,5231.42," Is that they're physically like twice the twice the man of anyone else. Like they're they're like,"
5231.42,5234.86," oh, they're models are bigger. They're giants. Yeah. Like Titans. I don't know."
5234.86,5239.26," I'm gonna see them. Like they're it's like you know the swinging dick just came swinging through. You know,"
5239.42,5245.9800000000005, like they stop you. Yeah. Yeah. And they act like they totally like ego trip and stuff. I saw them
5245.9800000000005,5250.780000000001," pasting some screenshots in the mess with one. And because they were just trying to like cause, you know,"
5250.780000000001,5256.46, mayhem and and the GM eventually came in to try to sort things out. And he you could just see
5256.46,5261.58," in the text. You're like, I'm here like all, you know. Yeah. And in an ever quest they were like the"
5261.58,5266.54, Neo from the Matrix. They could do anything. They wanted create items get rid of items. They do that.
5266.54,5270.94," Wow, too. They used to like my friend had an awesome day when like a GM was like, I'm"
5270.94,5275.1, going to show you the world and just transported them to all these places that he could never each.
5275.1,5279.34," And he's like, we're going to go see a dragon. They just go see a ghost of Christmas pass. Yeah."
5280.62,5284.78, That's usually what they end up doing like near the end of a game's life. Yeah. See a late player.
5284.78,5288.46," Yeah. Yeah. Because that's what they do when they're like, new person, new person. Come look at the"
5288.46,5293.66," cool stuff. It's like a sales pitch. Yeah. Totally. So like, you go to the car lot and you know,"
5293.82,5297.26," both you and the dealer know that you're going to get that pin. Oh, that's on a center block."
5298.46,5302.86," That's not going to stop him for showing you like the fucking way to make it. All right. Well, back to your"
5302.86,5308.94," rep going. Yeah. They did. Oh, I didn't print out the thing. I linked to it on the podcast where you"
5308.94,5314.94, had that the Ashrons call to or not to that's dead. That's what's called one. They're about to release patch 100.
5315.58,5320.46, Also for ever quest. They just did this thing where if you were a player in the last nine years
5320.46,5325.66," of the original ever quest, you can play until like July 6th for free and download the game and all the"
5325.66,5331.02, expansions and just restart for free. I thought that was amusing though that the time that you were
5331.02,5336.38," allowed to play for free was so small. Right. Like, okay, if I've been played in nine years and you really"
5336.38,5340.46," want me to come back, don't give me two weeks. I guess the thing is that you'd come back and see like,"
5340.46,5347.9800000000005," hey, we've had it. See what you masks and all the things class were. I do. I really do salute all,"
5347.98,5353.419999999999, you know snarkiness aside. The MMOs that can last that long and still have a player population right on.
5353.419999999999,5359.0199999999995," I think that that's cool. I mean, I went to the I followed all the links from the Ashrons call patch 100"
5359.0199999999995,5363.98, thing to the to the Ashrons call forums where people are talking about what might come up in this patch.
5363.98,5369.0199999999995," And I was like, it was amazing to me. My gut instinct of course was first to want to make fun of them all."
5369.0199999999995,5374.379999999999," It's like, wow, you're on a message board for them for Ashrons call and you know, and some of the"
5374.7,5381.26, positive like we're talking about patch 100. Think about how many patches that is. And you got people
5381.26,5387.34," speculating what's in it and people are writing like, I hope there's new quests like 100 patches later."
5387.34,5392.78," That's what your ambition is. I tend to be a little less. But then down and out, they have a nice community there."
5392.78,5397.900000000001," I tend to visualize metaphors as I'm hearing things. In this case, I imagine like a society of people that"
5397.900000000001,5402.9400000000005," live around like a trash dump and then they know that like, you know, New Year's has come or the"
5402.94,5407.259999999999, day after Christmas is so there's going to be like this big. There's a sudden bounty. They're all
5407.259999999999,5411.66," speculating on, you know, like, what's going to the rich people are going to give us their left of worse."
5413.66,5415.339999999999, I wonder if we'll get some meatpones.
5417.339999999999,5421.9," I think like, or, you know, like maybe someone returned a broken-erced card or radio check."
5421.9,5425.74, So radio checks is just going to throw it out. Maybe they'll get that card with like three wheels.
5425.74,5429.5," I don't, I don't, this is a metaphor. I don't mean this is real poverty. I mean, this is"
5429.5,5434.7," a fictional universe where it's, it's, it's in another, like a Dante's fear below."
5434.7,5439.02," I mean, I'm so sad that I said, all the astronauts call play. It's the thing to us."
5440.06,5444.7, Yeah. It's interesting that this has lasted astronauts called two by so long. Yeah.
5445.9,5450.14, Everquest as well. Everquest two didn't do. That's right. That's still around. Neither it is. But I'm
5450.14,5453.5," saying like, I still think everquest one probably has a higher player. I think so too."
5453.5,5459.02," Thank you. I heard it is million subscriber this past week. It did. No, it did. No."
5459.9,5464.3," Sean said it. Sean's been every time. Man, every time. It's so gullible."
5464.3,5469.1," Probably brands I put bought here. They brought you there a thousand. And then now,"
5469.1,5473.34," yeah, we're gonna hear about it now. Is he mad or sick? Pingered his."
5475.5,5483.42," 16,322. I don't know. I'm speaking. Yeah. He had a title though. So you want to take a break"
5483.42,5487.1, and talk about one C. Yeah. It's in a break or are we ending?
5487.1,5491.82, Dar. Let's talk this. Okay. Let's take no breaks. Okay. We're going to take the break because
5491.82,5495.5, minutes. But we have three minutes. But Sean and we want to hear your one two way. When
5495.5,5500.7," one other thing. If any was there. One thing. Oh, we were talking about age of Conan. Yes. I"
5500.7,5506.3, urge everyone to go read a very minion's age of Conan. Yes. I'm one of it's a very good
5506.3,5510.3, review. Excellent review. Yeah. Why are we looking at the clock? We haven't even got to the
5510.38,5515.34, last talk. Ryan's been sitting on that. Because I got to be at the sport thing. Do you
5515.34,5520.22," really listen? And those in an hour. I could come back to the, I mean, I don't want to just ignore"
5520.22,5524.62," the ones he's thinking because the fact of the matter is that you have a, like I said,"
5524.62,5530.3," publisher that's showing like eight PC games. One, I'm padding the numbers because they didn't show,"
5530.3,5535.1," but they are also working on Battle of Britain's Storm of War, which is the official sequel to"
5535.42,5540.22," L2 SteroVic. Not to be confused with L2 SteroVic, birds of prey, which is sort of a"
5540.22,5548.06," consolized. Take on L2 SteroVic that looks much more in line with what Storm of War, the next PC"
5548.06,5552.06," game is going to come out with, but actually uses a simulation models and stuff from L2,"
5552.06,5558.06, which is to say it's fucking fantastic. It's just that Storm of War is going to go to insane
5558.06,5564.06," extent to model weather. And I mean, like everything from like wind to clouds to like every single"
5564.14,5568.780000000001," component inside the interior of your plane so that when it's not just some randomized, you got"
5568.780000000001,5572.780000000001," clipped with the bullet, we're just going to pretend that this ALRON is like stuck or that your"
5572.780000000001,5576.9400000000005," feel tank and you know, we'll determine that if it's self-sealing or whatever, like it's actually"
5576.9400000000005,5582.06," going to pass through the plane and calculate what's going to happen when when when your shot there,"
5582.06,5588.22," which sounds like a whole lot of a way to talk about dying in a game, but it's important, and"
5588.22,5592.38," it's a people that are into that because I mean, in real life, people have flown and landed planes"
5592.46,5596.54," with tails missing and all sorts of insane stuff. So yeah, it's not game over,"
5596.54,5600.46, which is because you do get shot and for people that like seems that stuff is cool.
5600.46,5603.66," Right. And the and the bragging rights you're doing multiplayer, right?"
5603.66,5607.82," Say, I mean, whatever, horrendous damage you've had your vehicle and you still managed to win."
5607.82,5614.54," You get video to say it. By the way, you're a the Sean another plug I want to up is you wrote"
5614.54,5620.86," up this, uh, your impressions of this event. Also on oneup.com and the PC front door."
5621.339999999999,5626.78, Yeah. And that was an excellent story. Thanks. So that'll save me from having to go through it all over again.
5627.339999999999,5631.74," Like, just please, like if you're even slightly interested, go and check out that story and we'll talk"
5631.74,5635.98," about, you know, I'm trying to get like for a hands-on and I talk about a game called Cryostasis"
5635.98,5642.62," Nero, who could say something about that, because it's pretty interesting. Um, well, a lot of the"
5642.62,5646.46," games there, like I know, so they have a lot of Sims and stuff which I think is fantastic. They're keeping"
5646.46,5650.299999999999," that alive. And then this other kind of game, which I put into a category and that's like"
5651.179999999999,5656.38," like the equivalent of like black metal, you know, that comes from Norway and Poland and Scandinavian"
5656.38,5661.9," countries and stuff where it's like ages ago, metal went over and remember like the scorpion's"
5661.9,5666.7, video of like Gorky Park and stuff and how like cheesy like that was and then they actually had their own
5666.7,5670.94," like, you know, Russian metal and stuff. You know, these guys are behind the time. You know, it's like"
5670.94,5674.0599999999995," when you think when you thought of Eastern Europe is like holy shit, like that's where you pay"
5674.0599999999995,5678.7," 200 bucks for some shitty weavies. You can get like millers outpost for 10 bucks, you know. But then"
5679.179999999999,5683.98, over time they become capable with it and it takes on its own character identity and it comes back
5683.98,5687.26," and like now, you know, my point in the analogy is that there's people that are like,"
5687.26,5692.22," kind of sewers of that kind of metal. And likewise, I can imagine appreciating these games."
5692.22,5697.099999999999," And so the metal in this case is games like Doom, it's games, other other, you know, three"
5697.099999999999,5702.3," rounds and stuff and they, um, so they like painkillers, one of these, so that became came from Poland."
5702.3,5706.38," And it's like it out. I think that's a much better game than Quake 4. It's kind of like, well,"
5707.34,5711.26, they had had another team or if they just kept making the kind of games they did and evolved them in
5711.26,5715.02," this way rather than trying to make them like really, you know, serious or somewhere in between."
5715.74,5720.06, And so a lot of these games there like Necrovision definitely fit that bill in an
5720.06,5724.38," death track resurrection. They've always got like a grovey shit. Yeah, that was quite a trailer for"
5724.38,5729.26," Necrovision. That's it. Yeah, I dare you to, well, I listen to the whole thing. I dare you."
5730.14,5735.900000000001," But so the Cryostasis is um, to de-extend like all of their stuff is like de-extend, which is cool."
5736.46,5741.74," Um, the Cryostasis is like the perfect blending of crisis and like bio shock in terms of a title. Like"
5741.74,5745.34," it holds to mind both of the things that are going to work in some ways that the gameplay is like,"
5745.34,5750.38, like I'm talking about purely the word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like the premise of like so far so
5750.38,5756.38," good and like okay, this is set on Russian, you know, ice breaking ship and it's like lost in the"
5756.38,5762.46," Arctic circle and you're basically, you need to, you know, instead of a health bar, you have a"
5762.54,5766.46," heat meter and you have to keep your body temperature up and you do this by, you know, sources of"
5766.46,5772.86," available heat in the ship and as long as it's not like the dark world and, you know, the Metroid"
5772.86,5776.46," games and things like that where you're constant where it's like your lost, all we just have to"
5776.46,5780.7," be worried about it. But like there's a, you lost planet as well. I did play it for like 20 minutes."
5780.7,5785.58," I mean, it's like you do have a health bar and then you have a heat bar as well and the heat bar"
5785.58,5788.86, you're internal temperature like has to max with their health or you'll sort of just keep
5788.94,5794.78, dropping and you'll take damage and then you're using like either melee weapons or like a
5794.78,5801.82, bolt action rifles and trying to hit enemies who are like frost themed as well. So like
5802.86,5806.54, there was one guy who would like it looked like he was hitting the ground and like sending out bursts
5806.54,5813.9," of ice. So like, the leadcher heat instead of your health. Both yeah, physically hurt you when"
5813.9,5816.46," you were talking about types of attacks that were there. But you know, they were showing off a lot of"
5816.78,5821.18, the X10 features like when they would put a heat source in it would be like the ships completely
5821.18,5825.58, for as an acceptor on this heat source. You would see the water running like away from the heat source
5825.58,5830.7," and stuff like that. I mean, it was graphically impressive, but it still is like a super long way to go."
5830.7,5835.1," Like as soon as I started the demo, it was like crouch to pick up the weapon, but it didn't tell me"
5835.1,5839.02, how to pick up the weapon. I'm still in that phase with it where I'm looking like beyond the
5839.02,5843.02, technical stuff and just saying like what is the potential it has assuming it's going to have plenty of
5843.02,5851.5," time to be fixed up. And it's like the whole concept that you touch someone, you touch a dead body"
5851.5,5856.06, and you basically relive the last moment to their life and you get elements of like the final
5856.06,5860.860000000001," destination movies and stuff like that where it's kind of like, is this just like death porn,"
5860.860000000001,5866.780000000001," but it's more like a way to tell a story. And so you know, in bio-shock you pick up these recordings"
5866.780000000001,5871.02," and stuff and you would often hear people's last wishes and events, you know, preceding their"
5871.02,5875.26, death. And here you actually get to experience it firsthand. So I tend to think of that as at
5875.26,5880.700000000001," at least potentially as like a really, you know, streamlined way to tie all these multiple story threads"
5880.700000000001,5885.34," together. And then it's got this element of, I mean, it's actual gameplay. So, you know, one example"
5885.34,5889.9800000000005," that was their services crane. It ultimately falls on the guy and kills him, but you relive that part"
5889.9800000000005,5894.46, and you can suddenly alter the event. So he still dies with the crane falls another way and then that
5894.46,5898.540000000001, allows you to get through the environment somehow. They're really bizarre. The thing they had is that
5898.62,5902.38, there is a cow and you touch that and it's like boom all of a sudden you're on like the
5902.38,5908.38," slewson floor of like, you know, the slaughterhouse or something and you then move the cow and do something."
5908.38,5913.82," And there's like a, this is something interesting in games, right? I mean, you have like, there's technically"
5913.82,5919.98," no reason why we should just be the same character for the duration of a game. And in a lot of games,"
5919.98,5923.66," you know, like think of plenty games that aren't that way, you know, RPGs and stuff, but it'd be this"
5923.66,5928.94, kind of game where it lets you like you get to occupy all these different subject positions.
5928.94,5933.82," I'll use to be too academic, but like in the course of the game, you know, it's not just what is"
5933.82,5937.66," it to be Gordon Freeman, but it's like, and this person and this person and this person and"
5937.66,5942.139999999999, the turtle darkness to the real world. I didn't play that. So I'm glad you have to tell me about it.
5943.0199999999995,5947.0199999999995," Yeah, it was a game where the narrative was tied together by one single person and like the"
5947.0199999999995,5952.3," present, but every time you would find like a scrap of history, you know, whatever you would"
5952.62,5957.58, essentially play a short chapter as a person who was going through this like really this like short
5957.58,5961.58," lovecraft story, basically. It was like, I don't know how many 12 or so different characters."
5961.58,5963.02, Something something like that. Yeah.
5963.02,5966.9400000000005," The like knowledge they would find in there, you would learn in the present. It was kind of a"
5966.9400000000005,5971.9800000000005," cool way to like say, okay, this person in the past went mad and the following fashion and died,"
5971.9800000000005,5976.38, but also learned this spell. So now you get that spell and that was pretty brilliant. Cool.
5976.38,5980.9400000000005," Yeah, that. So maybe hopefully they look to that for some lessons. And it's like,"
5981.0199999999995,5983.82, hopefully it's not too cheesy because that's the other thing we always talk about stock or
5983.82,5987.58," I feel like we can get another scenario like that to come out of, you know, when we see this"
5987.58,5992.219999999999," turn your penis slash Russian games. But yeah, like I'd say point people with the story and"
5992.219999999999,5996.219999999999," let's Anthony, there's any other stuff there that got your interest, but it's like, it's like,"
5997.0199999999995,6000.299999999999," it's it'd be easy to dismiss a lot of it and say like, well, who the fuck cares? I mean,"
6000.299999999999,6005.0199999999995, I'm not you're not people aren't going to be searching like game sites for information on these games.
6005.0199999999995,6010.299999999999," Yeah. And, but like there, like you shouldn't dismiss them. I think there's like some potential there. And"
6010.3,6016.3," like even the one that surprised me is the fucking 4x4 game is like, who gives a shit. But I was like,"
6017.1,6021.58," when I started thinking true it, like this is cool. This is different. You know, this is not just"
6021.58,6027.900000000001," another version of a motor storm yet again or another one of, you know, like the basically mudbog and dirt games."
6027.900000000001,6034.3," It was like a really legitimate, serious, minded simulation of, you know, operating this kind of vehicle."
6034.3,6038.7," But it's like, if you imagine you're just in this world and it's like if crossing a creek,"
6038.78,6043.82, a creek bed can be a challenge or just getting over. There's a ton of rocks or something or like a
6043.82,6047.74," muddy hill and you're trying to go up it. I mean, you can choose to go up it and whatever,"
6047.74,6051.66," I mean, there's technical trials and there's time and stuff. But you have to know how to lock your"
6051.66,6055.34," differentials. You have to like, do all these different things. Maybe use a winch and like,"
6056.139999999999,6060.54," and it then becomes like, I'm kind of, I mean, this is a fun part about Sims, right? You know,"
6060.54,6065.74," like I was saying also in the story that when I play I'll too, it's a challenge if I can recover from"
6065.82,6069.34," stall and it's like, I get a sense of accomplishment from that and you're like, well, big, whoa,"
6069.34,6074.38," I can, you don't stall in Ace Combat or if you did, you could just press a button to get out of it."
6074.38,6078.94," That like defeats the purpose. So in here, it's like even the smallest thing, can I get over 20 feet"
6078.94,6083.9, of like terrain in front of me when that's kind of an accomplishment or true? Have you? I respect that.
6083.9,6088.46," I'm not sure if it's what I would want to do. There was an effort, it was for a specific audience."
6088.46,6091.42," It's for a specific audience. It was making me think like, well, what if I was playing a"
6091.9,6096.38," car racing game and I got a flat tire and the game made me change a tire? Yeah. Well, that's"
6096.38,6100.06," something in real life I hate doing. Right. So that's the trick, though. Is it about doing"
6100.06,6104.54," you obsess over in our cool with? Yeah, you maybe it would be, it's not cool to change the tire,"
6104.54,6107.9800000000005," but maybe it would be cool if you're like, hey, what if I, I had a vehicle and like, could actually"
6107.9800000000005,6112.14," get over this and if you would look at it in most circumstances, you'd be like, that's not even horse"
6112.14,6115.9800000000005," terrain. How are you going to, how is anything in the across here? It was a little different. But when"
6115.9800000000005,6120.9400000000005," they gave it demo, I really regret that I wasn't able to ask how many dogs I can fit in the"
6120.94,6127.179999999999," backs of the trucks. Well, maybe you can go back. You might have had an answer if that's"
6127.179999999999,6134.219999999999, my measure for quality in any offroading vehicle. How many dogs can I fit in the back? What's the
6134.219999999999,6140.86," eyes dogs? I say this is someone who, this is the surprising thing that that was interesting."
6140.86,6145.98," I say this is someone who like all through, like, calls us up. I would use to go out of my way to"
6145.98,6150.54," use the beds of people's trucks as trash cans. I got what tried like, there's nothing in the"
6150.54,6154.78, bed of that truck. There won't ever be anything in the bed of that truck. So I better find some
6154.78,6159.98, use for it. So I have to take my trash eyes through and in the back of the truck.
6164.94,6169.9," We might be at what the wind down time for this week. Because Ryan wants to talk about the,"
6170.62,6175.5," oh, the, what's the called the donkey wheel? What's the question? The question, donkey wheel?"
6175.82,6180.94," Right or lower cross time crank. Right. Uh, spoiler alert, law spoiler alert."
6182.62,6189.02," Sorry, that was just, you know, if you haven't seen the finale, we're going to talk about it here."
6189.02,6192.54," And if you haven't, I don't know why. Also go watch it then listen."
6193.82,6199.74," Yeah. So it was a magic crank. Right, that shit down. What the fuck was that Ryan? How do you feel that right?"
6199.74,6204.3, I don't know. You don't know. And move the island. Where in time or space?
6204.9400000000005,6210.06," I don't know. Oh, shit. What do you mean you don't know? The saw you do. You sit on, you, of course you know."
6210.06,6215.5," What do you get read like a 25 page paper on it? How are you holding out on this? No, no, where they put it?"
6215.5,6221.34," This is the, the, the, the township. I thought about it. Kiss you forgot. Maybe they, I think they moved it"
6221.34,6228.22, at two some later point in time. I agree with that. Like where else? I think. Or what if they moved it
6228.22,6233.5, earlier point? You'd have to change it such a radical point in time for the island to have moved though.
6233.58,6239.02," I mean, we're talking to like deep geological time for the island to be in another location."
6239.02,6242.14, Maybe the islands on a big boat or something. Nick can move it anytime.
6243.1,6249.18," Or it's on a giant turtle. Wait, what? Ryan, okay. So if depending on the type of island it is,"
6249.18,6252.62," how it's formed. I mean, we assume it's on the top. You're bringing, you're trying to bring like"
6252.62,6257.1," scientific logic. Well, I'm just saying island's moving the way that the Hawaiian, you know,"
6257.1,6261.58," that the Hawaiian island chain moves in. No, it's not moving like so. You're not,"
6261.9,6265.9," they picked it up. No, you're saying it's hard. 10 months and they popped it down."
6265.9,6270.62," So it doesn't exist for that. You're saying in, okay, like they're, they're moving through time."
6270.62,6275.34," And that creates the movement because like yes, if you did go say, you know, 200 million, I mean,"
6275.34,6280.78," you know, if you want like 50 million years, it's going to physically be elsewhere."
6280.78,6286.0599999999995," And reappear to another point in time. I think we should even, I don't think it's in question."
6286.0599999999995,6290.38, My problem with last night was that's not even like a question. I'm even interested in these years.
6290.86,6295.82, I think we all agree before we turn on the mics. It like now there could just be like cyborgs and shit on here.
6295.82,6300.06, They're what it's like. Demi as well. I still like it a lot. I love it. It's fun.
6300.7,6305.58," Yeah. But yeah. I don't, I don't need it to be far this season began. I mean, right."
6305.58,6308.86," I was like, what season two is where you're just like, okay, they could just do anything they want."
6308.86,6313.900000000001," Well, it's like the studio mentioned that the bad guys, the guy ended up being the bad guy of the season."
6313.900000000001,6318.9400000000005," He's basically died like three times in the last episode. Yeah. I mean, he was like a vampire."
6319.0199999999995,6324.219999999999," That was like, I had to touch. What was that? The Chris Farley skit?"
6324.219999999999,6329.259999999999," Where he's on like some kind of like local play, you know, it's like some local drama production thing."
6329.259999999999,6333.099999999999, This was a Saturday night at a life skit. And he's the guy who gets killed.
6333.099999999999,6339.0199999999995, Except he's like once he so loves being on the stage and adding that every time he keeps dragging it out
6339.0199999999995,6343.98," now and they're like, the guys just like stabbing him again. He's like, oh no, I'm stabbing him."
6343.98,6348.7, And it just goes on and on and on. So it's like Chris Farley does not want to die on the stage.
6348.7,6353.26," You know, he's kind of like that. He gets stabbed with like a K barrage."
6353.26,6357.5," He's like, you know, combat knife. They guess they're right in the kidney and then he climbs up a mountain."
6357.5,6361.179999999999, And then I thought it was kind of ridiculous because he descends the mountain on this elevator.
6361.179999999999,6367.9," And you know, we don't know exactly how far down it goes. But when lock-ass, you know, Ben, how deep is it? He's like deep."
6368.54,6373.82," Which was his, like if he was, if he was ghost face killer, he would have said deeper than in Navy seal."
6373.82,6379.98," So when they go down there, presumably the the transmitter on his arm, who would lose contact or something."
6379.98,6384.7," And then the explosives on the boat would have detonated. But no, like that like that's some high-tech shitties got."
6384.7,6389.98, So he's able to go all the way down to the depths of the earth. And this is lost. So he might be halfway to China for all we know.
6389.98,6395.0199999999995," Because that's where the time wheels at. And the time wheels not like some substrate, I'm shit. That's like deep."
6395.0199999999995,6399.5, So then they go and then the next thing we know is that Ben's turned into crank.
6399.5,6406.46," There's like, it's all, yeah, it's frozen and there's some higher glyphs. There's like some agent higher glyphs, like carved into the styrofoam wall."
6406.46,6411.34," He directly walked there and made it at that point. I mean, this game, this, yeah, he, the show had been missed."
6411.34,6414.62," Normal numerous other points, but that was totally a missed puzzle."
6414.62,6417.66," There was, there was a crank and some higher glyphs. I don't know what I'm saying."
6417.66,6419.02," Yeah, I turn the kid to get a candy."
6419.02,6419.74, You told him to go into the ground.
6419.74,6421.02, Go into the ground.
6421.66,6423.26, Yeah. So then he turns to time crank.
6424.7,6427.34," And it's like, that was the straight out of Tomb Raider."
6427.42,6431.34," We already talked about that though, because that's how we controlled the, uh, the black smoke"
6431.34,6435.18," monster too. He went down into the lure and crossed the, that was my problem with the vampire"
6435.18,6441.26," dude with the, you know, the heart monitor was, he, the smoke monster attacked him and there's like nothing happened"
6441.26,6447.02, after that. And like he's back. Yeah. Right. He was smoke monster. He's like more indestructible than the
6447.02,6453.34, kid in Jurassic Park after he got shocked on the fence. Like you ain't gonna die. That was your time to die if you
6453.42,6458.78," were going to. So this, the, the retarded theory that's probably true because it's lost again is that the,"
6458.78,6463.74," that the polar bear that ended up in the desert were, you know, they showed, uh, what's her face,"
6463.74,6469.1," you know, the archaeologist, she dig up the, yeah, the bear skeleton got there because they would use"
6469.1,6473.1, polar bears to turn that big ass crank. And the reason they would do it is because every time you
6473.1,6476.78," turn the crank, you have to leave the island and they didn't, they eventually got to a point"
6476.78,6481.74, where they didn't want to like have to sacrifice a person. Right. And it's the old down there.
6481.74,6486.3," So polar bears are trading. The polar bear doubt in there. Yeah, we're, it's all called to know to turn the"
6486.3,6494.7," time crank. That makes it. That makes it. It's, it's so stupid that it can wound up in the same place the polar bear was, right?"
6494.7,6498.86, So you think there were using bears to turn the wheel? Yes. I don't think so. I don't know.
6498.86,6504.78," I'm sure. That's actually kind of, that makes it much sense. It was, it was cringing now compared"
6504.78,6508.94," this. He's like, oh, it sounds like twilight zone. And I found that offensive as like a, uh,"
6509.0199999999995,6513.98, three kilograms of twilight zone. Yeah. That's what I'm certainly. I found that personally offensive
6513.98,6520.7, because what I would try to do with each of my episodes in my twilight zone was to have some
6520.7,6525.0199999999995," mystery, but also to explore like many old Star Trek episodes, some, you know, at the show,"
6525.0199999999995,6530.62," share our Phil Sofford. Therefore racism is bad. Right. And then, and then to wrap it up at the end of"
6530.62,6537.74," each episode. Now this, the comparison like, you know, holds and so far is this show has got a bunch of"
6537.74,6542.38," mysteries, but it's got it's missing that I'm sure a softical angle and then any sense of closure."
6542.38,6547.98, So you're comparing a half hour one-on-a-pepper so to a six season. I'm not certainly. Of course.
6549.98,6554.46, Do you think that they're going to have a satisfying conclusion to all this? They better.
6555.34,6559.0199999999995," But do you think they will? I mean, they were, they're better. It tells me you're fooling yourself."
6559.58,6563.98, I don't know. Yeah. I don't think they're going to. I think you tripped. I'm not sure if they
6563.98,6570.0599999999995, will. And I sort of don't care. I still enjoy the joy. I want to hope that it's worth the end.
6571.259999999999,6576.86," Again, I prefer to not buy all the exact answers. I've been burned by too many shows to expect"
6576.86,6580.86," where they had a mystery, but had no idea where I was going. Especially just kind of admitted it."
6580.86,6586.139999999999," Yeah. And it's a problem for me isn't it? When peaks, if you just stop caring about it and"
6586.139999999999,6591.5," you because the big attract, then you're free. The big attract to this show, though all along,"
6592.22,6597.9," was that engagement that like if I just think through this hard enough, it will like I will come"
6597.9,6601.66, to conclusions that are that other people haven't been able to because they haven't
6602.46,6605.74, either looked hard enough or have them in perceptive enough. And when you get to the point where
6605.74,6612.78," you no longer believe in that, you lose a huge portion of what made the show so attractive in the first place."
6613.5,6619.34, Right. I am at the point where everything I see that like has the the air of a clue to me is
6619.42,6623.74, just instantly red herring. There's like because they show that to me and because I can kind of
6623.74,6627.18," make a logical connection, it is therefore completely the wrong connection to make."
6627.18,6632.14, Yeah. I do think that they definitely feel like they're on a course now. I think they've clearly
6633.02,6637.82, they seem it seems to me like they're laying enough clues that they've thought it through.
6637.82,6641.58, Whether what they've thought through is actually going to be satisfying to us.
6642.3,6647.58," I mean, that could just be that the old cliche of you know that it's just it's never going to be as good"
6647.66,6652.3, as what we could. What we are going to imagine in our head. Right. It's just doomed to be disappointing.
6652.3,6658.22," But we don't know though. It's almost more fun not to know. I mean, this it I don't think they had"
6658.22,6663.9, this this series was not written. It scripted in its entirety from the beginning. It was not.
6663.9,6668.46, And then we're seeing it just you know being recorded and performed and filmed and stuff.
6668.46,6672.62," And because of that, I think that there's always there's all you always have to build in the"
6672.62,6677.34, wiggle room to say shit. We need to stretch this out. We need to pad this out and it's a
6677.34,6685.26, tail. And there's just so much potential for things to to go wrong. But it feels like they're past that.
6685.26,6689.82, Like that that's what season two and three were about that kind of padding and we don't know
6689.82,6694.94," but we're going. Right. Yeah. I mean they they committed to like okay, we know exactly how many"
6694.94,6699.34," episodes we have left. This is what we needed ABC to commit to. I mean, this is a problem with TV"
6699.34,6705.42," as an medium in general in America. Like X5, what happened to X5 is like yeah like resilient television."
6705.42,6710.22, Like they often make series and they're like this is a 13 episode series. We will have a beginning
6710.22,6713.58, and then it's like a novel. Right. And they just don't set this. This is what's going to do that.
6713.58,6717.58," Battle stars that it's ending. You know, it's like, thank God. It's so rare when they do that."
6717.58,6722.46, Dude. It's good. I still come a hatred. It's by far better than the last.
6722.46,6725.900000000001, I'm not only it's better. It's better than the last. I'm only about to start.
6726.46,6731.5, Now the wire was another example of one that had a limited run. It was brilliant all the way up to the last one.
6731.5,6736.86," I mean, as a writer, you just have to know exactly because making generation kill. I'm excited about that. Very excited about that."
6737.82,6742.78," Oh, I haven't read the book. Yeah, David Simon, the guy made the wires has us. I think it's a seven part"
6743.74,6748.219999999999," series called Generation Kill. Someone's going to have to tape it. Yeah. Obviously,"
6748.54,6752.62, I'm going to be going it. Last. I'll be looking.
6752.62,6757.02," Did you back to back to Laos? Yeah. How much theory is that? I mean, you're still true. Believe it right."
6757.58,6763.740000000001, Laos is like the green lantern to you. Like it can do no wrong. It can spawn guy gardeners and
6763.740000000001,6767.9800000000005," booster goals and it's still. Hey, guy gardeners. Cool. I mean, this episode did not"
6767.9800000000005,6775.02," see any way. Have the impact of the last seasons one. Yeah, Natalie. With what's his face in the coffin?"
6775.26,6780.780000000001, We want to not spell it. We spoil the rest. We can lock on the coffin. Yeah. And there were two
6780.780000000001,6786.700000000001," alternate endings. They filmed it. Yeah, watch it. Yeah, whatever. With Desmond and Soyla."
6786.700000000001,6792.9400000000005," Yeah, locks on the coffin. Who know freaking knows why I think it's like again. I think it's a"
6792.9400000000005,6797.34," total right here. Yeah. That's a little bit of the problem. What Sean, what you're saying, where when"
6797.34,6804.780000000001," certain things go out to window, it does sort of, you know, it dissipates any of, like I had no feeling"
6804.78,6809.98," of like, woo. It's locked because it's like, well, okay, there could be 18 fucking different"
6809.98,6814.7," explanations for this now. I mean, because they've thrown logic out the window. So I don't know."
6814.7,6819.66," He's probably not dead, right? Or if he's dead, he's going to go back and time and be alive or whatever."
6819.66,6824.78, Or this is some alterity. Whatever the fuck. That's the thing. They say like he has to come back to
6824.78,6830.54," the island with the right. So then what is the big scary? Like, oh my god, or, you know, that big"
6830.62,6835.98," horrific thing of single lock in the coffin is one person was like, oh my god, he's dead."
6835.98,6840.22," And it doesn't matter though because death itself has been made irrelevant, you know, right. I mean,"
6840.22,6845.58," you have dead people all over this. Yeah, they're all over. And yeah, well, this is kind of"
6845.58,6849.5," a visit to people. This is kind of like a tissue. I was reading, you know, like I showed you and"
6849.5,6854.54," guy put up a review of, I don't care for it. It's great, but I less of comments, but when he's talking about,"
6855.5,6859.98," you know, the the importance of, you know, the war economy as I think in the game."
6859.98,6866.219999999999," And I'm like, but please tell me though that there's not this, you know, this Russian doll arrangement"
6866.219999999999,6871.099999999999," of conspiracies on top of that because like if it's anything like the previous middle of your games,"
6871.099999999999,6875.74," it's like, well, who cares about whatever it's wanting and encouraging you to think through about"
6875.74,6881.0199999999995, a war economy when the fucking presidents like the chief conspirator and then the governments controlled by
6881.0199999999995,6886.7," dead people's fucking AI and right, every other like bit of batshit insanity. So it's like,"
6886.7,6892.22," you know, it's like, okay, well, why are we worried about people profiteering on war when it's like"
6892.22,6897.0199999999995," the fucking like, like if the George Bush was like a literal boogieman, you know, it's what if what if he was"
6897.0199999999995,6901.82," the smoke monster. Oh, it's just like suddenly, you know, like, well, fuck the little work on me, like we got the smoke"
6901.82,6909.74," monster. That's a bigger problem. That's right. Well, they're with the economy after we get the"
6909.82,6916.78," giant space aliens not to be our president anymore. So that's kind of fucked up. So that that I mean,"
6916.78,6921.34," I think that we're solving self-adjust as that issue too. You know, I mean, like where you remove"
6922.139999999999,6927.099999999999," the sting of death and you remove, you know, the, the kind of stuff logic and and after a while,"
6927.099999999999,6932.86, you just guarantee that whatever solution or to your riddle is going to be one that no
6932.86,6937.5," would have would have ever guessed in the first place. And I have accused Jeff Low, a comics writer of"
6937.58,6942.7," these sort of like shitty mystery stories and detective stories where it's like a manganet,"
6942.7,6949.18," detective story where not one, you know, bit of thinking you could have done an observation and an induction"
6949.18,6954.78, and deduction as you're seeing this thing could have helped you to decipher the fucking
6954.78,6959.74, the culprit because the culprits introduced on the last page and never existed or never appeared in
6959.74,6965.1," any way, shape or form, not only in the book, but in the fucking history of the fucking comic. Did you know you"
6965.1,6971.26," had a son? No. Well, he did it. So let's hope they don't do that. Right."
6971.26,6977.660000000001," Hope it still watches till you ever read Batman, Hush. That's one of them. That long Halloween"
6977.660000000001,6984.3," though, Hush is the biggest sorry, let's not pause for Anthony to talk to you."
6984.3,6993.34," He's just like, I was trying to just hold out and then I really just wanted to like,"
6993.34,6996.78," when you guys were like Anthony do you have anything to say about last night, it's wanted to be"
6996.78,7002.54," there. Dude, you're walking walk away. Were you holding one in the whole night? No, I got nothing."
7002.54,7008.3, I'm going to save him off of it. All right. Right. You didn't like Hush either. We're not going to wrap up Jeff.
7008.3,7012.3," You can go, you guys can leave writing and I got to talk about comics. You can't. I have to go."
7012.3,7016.9400000000005, You can keep it rolling. I'm dying by coming. Now we're good. That's writing unless you got some
7016.94,7028.139999999999," to say. I'm cool. You did your last comic, we should buy it. No. What if you heard it was"
7029.5,7032.94," written by Jeff Lowe? Yeah, I put this in and thank you. That was the word. I was looking for"
7033.339999999999,7039.5," you wouldn't buy it. If it was canon. What if it was written by Mark Wade? Is that oh, I'm my"
7039.5,7045.58," pinwork. Where is it? Well, which is by a last comic by Mark Wade? I, okay. So there's a world"
7045.58,7051.58, where you would buy a last comic that I am a great fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. So we hadn't
7051.58,7057.02," wrote it then. But even this Josie we didn't pin to comic that is currently, you know,"
7057.02,7060.86, season eight quote unquote. Like I've read some of it like I know. Which one is the
7060.94,7069.099999999999," Serenity or the expuffy. Oh, Buffy. The Vampire Slayer. Season eight in comics. Like it doesn't"
7069.099999999999,7072.86, interest me. It's not doing it for you. I mean the idea I guess is kind of cool. It's a
7072.86,7080.139999999999," key comic. Continue it on TV, but it's no continuity. It's just kind of down. I wouldn't read a"
7080.139999999999,7085.259999999999," last comic. Okay. Yeah, dude. Do some skin. Let's talk about anything. Just picked up Serenity"
7085.26,7093.74," comics and we out. Yeah. Okay, we're done."
