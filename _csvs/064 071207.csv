11.52,13.36," Dell, go play."
13.36,29.48, And we're back again from Santa Monica here in the Echo Chamber.
29.48,31.2, I've got a hate having to balance that out.
31.2,32.4, You have no idea what a pan that is.
32.4,38.08, But this is the one up radio podcast special Meet 3 2007 part 2.
38.08,43.04, John Davidson and Shane Benthouse in here with me as is Dan Shu from EGM.
43.04,46.96, That's Dan Shu Shu.
46.96,50.56, My tag actually says Dan Dan Shu.
50.56,51.56, Wiley?
51.56,52.56, Who else?
52.56,53.56, Dan Shu Shu?
53.56,54.56, Wow.
54.56,57.28, He's a pair of shoes.
57.28,59.28, And my Chinese nickname is Fan Fan.
59.28,61.28, So it's Dan Dan Fan Fan Shu Shu.
61.28,62.28, Wow.
62.28,63.28, That's your Chinese nickname Fan Fan.
63.28,65.28, That's like a baby Chinese name.
65.28,66.28," Oh, like a place."
66.28,67.28, I don't know why we're talking about.
67.28,68.28, I don't know.
68.28,69.28, I don't know.
69.28,70.28, I don't know.
70.28,71.28, I don't know.
71.28,72.28, I don't know.
72.52,73.68, Why did I do that?
73.68,75.04, Why did I do that?
75.04,76.04, Fan Fan.
76.04,79.0," So anyway, we figured we get this crew together and talk about games."
79.0,82.96000000000001," Since we did press conferences the death yesterday, we'll leave those things buried."
82.96000000000001,87.8, But I know that Shane feels compelled to come back and wrap up a couple things.
87.8,91.08," It's funny when we do this podcast, you think people would talk about what we said about"
91.08,94.32," the press conferences, but what we said about games, but instead they really strange things"
94.32,95.32, to obsess about.
95.32,99.32," And one of the things, I made that off-hand comment about Metal Gear being like possibly"
99.32,103.67999999999999, allegorical for the video game of the war that's going on right now.
103.67999999999999,106.6, That was the theory of the game where we were talking about the war.
106.6,108.08," And end of your life war, but could you?"
108.08,111.52, Could you have done work on multiple levels and he's kind of impenetrable and he does
111.52,113.47999999999999, a lot of symbolic stuff?
113.47999999999999,116.83999999999999," And I thought maybe there were little elements of that, but I wasn't actually posing"
116.83999999999999,118.56, some grand thesis.
118.56,121.75999999999999," And with strange people on the boards did, they went back and tried to pull out things"
121.75999999999999,123.96, to support this and everyone got all obsessed about it.
123.96,124.96, I wasn't saying that.
125.03999999999999,131.28, Making the stuff in the trailer that said that oil was the war of the 20th century
131.28,136.48," and war as an industry in the 21st century, and that's what's needed to perpetuate things."
136.48,137.88," Right, and there's more than that too."
137.88,140.56, But it isn't the first time that he's had in jokes like that.
140.56,144.95999999999998," Like last year's TGS trailer, there's obvious stuff about the real video game console"
144.95999999999998,147.64," war, but yeah, I wasn't saying that that's exactly what he's saying."
147.64,149.51999999999998, I was just tossing that out there.
149.51999999999998,154.2," The other thing I wanted to catch real backup on is Mario Galaxy, which you hate."
154.28,155.56," Yeah, I'm apparently hated."
155.56,158.39999999999998, I was told that you were visibly smiling while playing it.
158.39999999999998,158.92, I was.
158.92,159.92, I was smiling.
159.92,161.48," And as I was walking around, he treated it."
161.48,163.76," People were coming out to me and be like, why do you hate Mario?"
163.76,164.79999999999998," Like, now I don't hate Mario."
164.79999999999998,168.16," In fact, I really like it, but I'm still not completely sold on the level design."
168.16,169.88, Based on the levels I had played.
169.88,173.39999999999998, But then today there was a roundtable and they showed some more levels.
173.39999999999998,177.04, They talked about how there are huge planets where it's so round.
177.04,179.44," I mean, so big that it isn't rounding to more it's flat."
179.44,183.64," And there are other levels that are not even on, spheres, and Jeremy was saying this."
183.64,186.83999999999997," 40 galaxies, 120 different areas."
186.83999999999997,189.0, So apparently the variety is there.
189.0,191.39999999999998, So I don't need to be worried about everything just being a little planetoid.
191.39999999999998,192.72, Because that was my fear.
192.72,197.44, And I want this game to be as expansive and cool as Mario 64.
197.44,200.0," Much like like Mario Sunshine, I thought it was a little limited by its focus."
200.0,202.0, And I didn't want this game to be quite as limited.
202.0,206.16," OK, so are you saying that you were wrong or are you just trying to make up for people"
206.16,207.16, not calling you out?
207.16,211.11999999999998, I think people may have misconstrued my way away.
211.11999999999998,212.11999999999998, Misconstrued.
212.20000000000002,216.56," You came up to me and said, Mario, disappointing."
216.56,218.56, He said it just like that.
218.56,219.92000000000002, I didn't.
219.92000000000002,220.92000000000002, You use those words.
220.92000000000002,222.28," You were like, Mario, disappointing."
222.28,223.28, You didn't like it.
223.28,224.28, No.
224.28,225.56, I'm not saying you hated it.
225.56,226.56, You definitely.
226.56,230.32," I just recently, I'm, you definitely say it was disappointing."
230.32,232.36, I can still be disappointed in the game as really all.
232.36,236.44," But I mean, a listener should understand, like I know Shane, we all know we have to kind"
236.44,238.84, of like everything that comes out of his mouth.
238.84,240.6, He kind of have to filter on.
240.6,241.6, Because he exaggerates.
241.6,242.92, He's never neutral.
242.92,243.92, He either loves something.
243.92,244.92, He hates something.
244.92,246.12, It's always one extreme.
246.12,248.12, So it's a bit of a good on podcast.
248.12,249.12, I apologize.
249.12,252.4," And then I was at the Barker Hangar 83, where you go and play games, walk up and play."
252.4,254.6," Oh, by the way, we got a two-bar crash."
254.6,255.92, I just went on that in a minute.
255.92,256.92, Right.
256.92,257.92, I want to let people know we are going to cover.
257.92,258.92, But that's where it nights was.
258.92,261.28," You can actually play it, say, go and play it in front of you, in the nights for"
261.28,263.64," week, the night's sequel."
263.64,268.12, And I was impressed by that because I expected to be really terrible when it wasn't terrible.
268.12,270.08, Because the videos we'd seen previously didn't look very good.
270.08,271.08, And it wasn't bad.
271.08,272.68," In fact, it looks more promising than I expected."
272.68,276.12," So I told Jeremy Peris that he's like, oh, you hate Mario in love nights."
276.12,278.12, It's like 1997 all over again.
278.12,279.76," No, it isn't."
279.76,282.08, So I just want to clear there on those two things.
282.08,283.4, You needed to do a retronaut.
283.4,284.4, Yeah.
284.4,285.4, Definitely.
285.4,286.4, We should.
286.4,287.4, I was actually a huge van in nights back with it.
287.4,289.4, It's very clarified the third thing as well.
289.4,290.4," Oh, yeah."
290.4,293.64," When we were talking about Resident Evil and being said potentially in Africa, we don't even"
293.64,295.47999999999996, know that we just think it's in Africa.
295.47999999999996,300.0," And I made a comment that like, Africans are genetically predisposed to be better at marathon"
300.24,301.92, and there is scientific research for that.
301.92,304.24," And I can show you, I could point you to those links."
304.24,305.96, But there's no way that a racist comment.
305.96,307.56," And like, no intention or racism."
307.56,308.4, No intention of that.
308.4,313.48," In fact, however, this football season Shane will be doing predictions in Vegas for"
313.48,316.32, it might be winning the Super Bowl.
316.32,317.32, No.
317.32,322.16, And what's even weirder about that joke is it wasn't entirely my joke.
322.16,324.76, I kind of blew Joe Closet shoot.
324.76,327.32, So now Shane wants to give me credit for the racist job.
327.32,328.32, That's not what I'm a racist.
328.36,329.32, Apparently.
329.32,333.56," But yeah, shoot after the Microsoft Fresco, I was with their first show that trailer."
333.56,334.56, You said.
334.56,338.28, So someone pointed out in the books today that the guy in the Resident Evil trailer is Chris.
338.28,339.28, Yes.
339.28,340.28, Is that true?
340.28,344.08," I mean, for a fact, it's always been presumed from that original trailer to years ago."
344.08,345.92," Maybe we don't know that, but it looks like Chris."
345.92,348.84, So it definitely looks like I'm in the characterization as definitely there.
348.84,350.88," But yeah, Capcom has never really talked about this game."
350.88,351.88, No?
351.88,352.88, No.
352.88,355.2," I'm just so I was so glad to see it, not just because I predicted it, but because it just"
355.2,356.2, looks so cool.
356.2,360.32," And you know, it's kind of one of the things you'd seen a few pictures of here and there."
360.32,364.32," But it's been going on for a while, you've been thinking about the game and to have a little"
364.32,368.56, more to actually hang your hat on as far as like talking about the game is awesome.
368.56,369.71999999999997," Well, I like how unique it looks."
369.71999999999997,371.52, It doesn't look like Resident Evil anymore.
371.52,372.52, That's totally awesome.
372.52,374.91999999999996, And I'm really happy about that.
374.91999999999996,375.91999999999996, All right.
375.91999999999996,376.91999999999996, So let's dig into some games.
376.91999999999996,381.96," I, for me, E3 started with Mass Effect and I haven't had a chance really to go crazy on that"
381.96,382.96, as much as I want to.
382.96,383.96, Interesting.
383.96,384.96, So why don't people talk about this?
384.96,385.96, Why don't people talk about that?
385.96,392.59999999999997," I mean, today in tomorrow we'll do a lot of games, spooging and potentially hating on."
392.59999999999997,395.2," But yeah, Mass Effect is how we check."
395.2,396.68," Well, I can sum it up real easily."
396.68,401.03999999999996, And I've said this to people and I'm so I'm now just saying from everybody is I am more
401.03999999999996,404.2, excited from Mass Effect than I am for Halo 3.
404.2,405.47999999999996," And I mean, I am a Halo fan."
405.47999999999996,410.32," I'm not like the, I'm not the Luke Smith Halo fan of the world."
410.32,411.59999999999997, But I've been a big fan of Halo.
411.68,415.68, I've been a big fan of Halo for single player because I wanted to see where the story goes.
415.68,418.40000000000003, And I am excited for Halo 3 and I think the single player looks really good.
418.40000000000003,422.36, Mass Effect goes above and beyond what I've wanted.
422.36,425.6," Like when I go to play games on my time, it's, yeah, that's my entertainment."
425.6,431.08000000000004," You know, that's like, you know, you might choose to go play a sport or watch TV or read a"
431.08000000000004,432.08000000000004, book.
432.08000000000004,434.08000000000004," And for me, it's sitting down and playing a good video game and really getting a"
434.08000000000004,435.32000000000005, grossed in it.
435.32000000000005,441.56," And God, it's so amazing how quickly I got engrossed in that, especially when"
441.56,444.44, the first time using the conversation system.
444.44,448.8, It's so quick to get drawn into and it's so natural and easy.
448.8,452.6," And you know, we've been watching that for a while and watching them do it is one thing."
452.6,456.04," Because you know, you watch some in demo game and you think, I've seen guys demo game."
456.04,457.76, This guy's demo this game 50 times.
457.76,459.56, He knows exactly how to go through this segment.
459.56,461.64, He's just doing it because he knows how it works.
461.64,465.6, So what makes Mass Effect's dialogue better than the dialogue trees and coder?
465.6,469.6," Because in coder, you read the dialogue and then you hear due to on the screen, parrot it."
469.6,471.08, Or they didn't even have a voice over in that case.
471.08,472.08, Exactly.
472.08,477.44," Whereas in this, the dialogue options, so there's the people of screen show, there's"
477.44,482.2, that little hub and it has six blobs around it with the different reactions.
482.2,486.68, And the expressions that are written out aren't what he will say.
486.68,489.36, They are the sentiment that he will convey.
489.36,493.15999999999997," And I mean, it appears that he doesn't even always say the same thing for the same"
493.15999999999997,494.15999999999997, choice.
494.15999999999997,499.15999999999997, There's a bunch of things he could because he's responding to what the path through
499.15999999999997,500.15999999999997, the script is unfolding.
500.20000000000005,506.04, So it's very contextual and it's picking sound and animation to keep the conversation
506.04,508.0, flowing going in character.
508.0,512.0400000000001, And also the emotional range is always mapped to the same directions.
512.0400000000001,516.36," So the top left hand corner is always the most diplomatic option, I think that's what"
516.36,517.36, it's had.
517.36,519.28, And then their bottom right is always the most aggressive.
519.28,526.1600000000001, So you can also play the conversation just by knowing roughly on the emotional range
526.1600000000001,527.1600000000001, where you want to be going.
527.16,530.8399999999999, You can keep the flow of the conversation going just by tapping the stick and keeping
530.8399999999999,531.8399999999999, it flowing along.
531.8399999999999,536.0799999999999, But sometimes it'll just be two words and he'll spout a couple of paragraphs of the words.
536.0799999999999,540.24, What's really cool about the two words is it's not so super high concept where they're
540.24,544.16, like they don't give you some flowery explanation of how dude is thinking.
544.16,545.8, It's more like just go dress her down.
545.8,549.04," It would be, it's exactly like what you would be thinking in the back of your head of"
549.04,550.4, how you're going to phrase a sentence.
550.4,555.24, And it goes all the way to in some instances kill this person.
555.24,559.04, You can finish a conversation just by pulling your gun and kicking them down and shooting
559.04,560.52, them in the head.
560.52,566.08," But that very much depends on how you've been, how you've been building the character"
566.08,570.84," up to that point because there are elements of your character and your stats, the"
570.84,572.24," impact, the conversation system."
572.24,576.72," So if you've been building up your charisma in a certain way, you'll get these blue"
576.72,581.52," paragraph on conversation options, which we should well appear as an extra option that"
581.52,586.0799999999999, you wouldn't previously have had where it'll be an extra charming way of doing things.
586.0799999999999,590.56," And similarly, if you're being particularly evil and you're building up all the sort of"
590.56,595.0799999999999," mean stuff, there'll be extra evil that like the killing people pops up when you sort"
595.0799999999999,598.68, of plumb the depths of being like a real mean guy.
598.68,600.16, So it's not just lightside dark side.
600.16,601.16," No, more nuanced."
601.16,604.52, And also lightside and dark side do not balance each other the way they did in
604.52,608.12, coat or you know in coat or you could be really good and then you could pull yourself
608.12,609.4, back towards the middle.
609.4,612.76, And now you have good and bad stats permanently.
612.76,617.12," So if you've been bad, you can't flip halfway through the game and suddenly become"
617.12,618.12, good.
618.12,621.52, You're always going to have those evil deeds in the character's history and it'll also
621.52,626.4399999999999, impact the way certain characters or races will respond to you throughout the game.
626.4399999999999,628.88," People in the world are always going to know that you did, you know, that you behaved"
628.88,629.88, however it was you behaved.
629.88,633.12," Yeah, if you're the guy that killed this character and he was instrumental to one of the"
633.12,636.28, sort of side paths and he won't with any connection to that.
636.36,638.52, You're the guy that killed that killed that dude.
638.52,639.52, I'm not helping you.
639.52,644.8399999999999," And to like what Garnet said like in coat or you know, when you can read faster than"
644.8399999999999,647.0799999999999, you can hear the entire dialogue thing.
647.0799999999999,650.36," So you could if you read it, you're like, okay, I just skipped it the next thing."
650.36,654.36, So you're always cutting off after what I was cutting off conversation but in this game
654.36,656.72, because you don't know what anyone's going to say.
656.72,663.1999999999999, It's plays out like a movie and it's complimented by these awesome animations.
663.2,664.5200000000001," Like there, there's alien races."
664.5200000000001,665.5200000000001, These people look real.
665.5200000000001,666.84, They have to do the eyes.
666.84,669.6800000000001," Well, the facial reactions are kind of subtle."
669.6800000000001,671.96," You know, it's not just a big smile or a frown."
671.96,673.2800000000001," It's just, it's aerial."
673.2800000000001,678.08," And then so like when you're insulting somebody, like you could just be a smart ass all"
678.08,682.72, the time and you're insulting this big alien about his race and kind of implying that
682.72,685.44, it was a weak race that because they got wiped out.
685.44,689.0400000000001, And then just you could tell in the tone of his voice and even though he's an alien
689.0400000000001,692.6800000000001, creature and doesn't look human at all that he's not happy about this.
692.76,696.0799999999999, He starts to really start to lean forward and you can see him scowl and we were talking
696.0799999999999,699.92, to Greg and he was like there were a few years ago where they were building characters
699.92,701.56, out of 16 pixels.
701.56,706.92, And now they're able to tweak the muscles around an alien's eye to convey like that he's
706.92,707.92, getting angry at you.
707.92,708.92, It's funny.
708.92,711.4799999999999, That reminds me also of having this sword which has really amazing cutscenes where
711.4799999999999,714.4399999999999," previously people talking wasn't something you wanted to watch and you were like,"
714.4399999999999,717.0," you know, non-moving talking heads and the game is keep going."
717.0,720.0, But now as emotions and voice acting get better and better and like you can watch the
720.0,721.0, faces and it looks real.
721.08,724.08, It's like watching a movie and it's not so boring to watch people talk anymore.
724.08,725.08," Yeah, it's weird."
725.08,729.56, Like you could really sit there and watch people talk in Mass Effect and it's like
729.56,731.08, you feel like you're watching a sci-fi movie.
731.08,734.76, Well another thing about Mass Effect is that here at E3 they debut this new visual
734.76,737.92, filter which we hadn't seen previously and it's kind of divisive some people don't like
737.92,738.92, it.
738.92,739.92, I think it looks kind of cool.
739.92,740.92, I really like it.
740.92,745.44, It's a bit like the early before the silent hell effects got really wild.
745.44,749.92, It's just a film grain really fine noise filter or everything and it from a distance
749.9599999999999,753.12, it smoothed the edges off a little bit and I think it's allowed them to do some stuff
753.12,756.92, with the by focusing the detail in some areas or not in others.
756.92,758.12, Like he does a field stuff.
758.12,759.4799999999999," Yeah, there's a lot of shit going on."
759.4799999999999,761.56, There's a lot going on with the focus effects and stuff.
761.56,764.16," But the grain really, it gives it a gritty."
764.16,765.56, I really really like it too.
765.56,770.64, Because they said they've been looking at like late 70s early 80s sci-fi movies and
770.64,777.3199999999999," a lot of the sort of the grand sci-fi movies, you know, Star Wars and 2001 as silent running"
777.32,782.6," and light lots of these sort of big, even things like black hole and big spaceships"
782.6,788.48," and big epic robot fights and even the music, it's like the sort of 70s analogs,"
788.48,789.48, synths sci-fi movies.
789.48,790.48, It's very fun to watch.
790.48,793.84," Yeah, it's like it's very evocative."
793.84,794.84, Nice.
794.84,797.5600000000001," Yeah, I think we're all in agreement that Mass Effect is one of the best games here."
797.5600000000001,800.88," Yeah, so the counter argument by the way on the filter since we're all in, we all liked it"
800.88,803.48, because I've had this argument with Mark and Kathleen is that they felt like looking
803.48,807.2800000000001," at the television, it looked like there was something wrong with the television."
807.3199999999999,812.28, I think it's a little distracting and it's going to take me getting used to because that's
812.28,815.92," all I could pay attention to the first time I'm looking at, but I think after you're about"
815.92,817.92," an hour in, you probably won't notice."
817.92,818.92," Oh, and not."
818.92,821.92," There's like other subtle things they did, did you notice that they darken the edges?"
821.92,822.92, Yeah.
822.92,827.12," So it kind of puts more of a, it gives a weird depth of vision."
827.12,832.4," Definitely also do a lot with that depth stuff and fighting things out to direct, they"
832.4,835.6, were saying that they're using it to direct your attention to something because the unreal
835.6,837.36, engine allows them to do so much stuff.
837.36,841.52," I mean, the first thing they showed is when went down to the planet was that six-wheeled"
841.52,846.44," buggy thing that hops around, it gets, yeah, the makeover gets dropped out of a ship and"
846.44,851.08, it splashes down into the water and the water comes up over the entire makeover and then
851.08,853.64, water droplets drip off it and it's all in engine.
853.64,857.9200000000001," And they're saying when they can render stuff at that detail in engine, when there's"
857.9200000000001,859.96," so much shit on screen, you don't know what to look at."
859.96,864.0, So the reason they're blurring things out and darkening things is to tell you really
864.0,868.2, subtly what your attention should be on because otherwise it would just be overload and
868.2,872.32, everything would be listening and shiny and sparkling.
872.32,875.6, So we've teased about a billion times that Shane's been playing Heavenly Sword and it's
875.6,877.0, here playable.
877.0,879.64," So share some impressions now, Shane about Heavenly Sword."
879.64,884.28," I played all the things that are here and it's really, I'm really impressed."
884.28,887.48, Like I was very skeptical about this game because the game these guys made previously
887.48,891.72," was Kung Fu Kei, for Xbox which I did not like, I gave the game a five and I think was"
891.72,893.12, a very good game.
893.12,897.48," So yeah Heavenly Sword, the first of all the presentation, they hired Weta which is the"
897.48,901.12, New Zealand studio who did all the special effects for Lord of the Rings in King Kong to
901.12,905.12, do all the cutscenes and all the voice acting and all the motion capture.
905.12,910.64," And Sandy Circus doing, actually characters, he's the main villain, King Botan and it's"
910.64,911.64, stunning.
911.64,913.12, I mean the cutscenes are unbelievable.
913.12,917.88," They're the best cutscenes I've ever seen in any game, bar none, unbelievable."
917.88,919.16, She's interesting and I can't point at that.
919.16,922.48," I want to get to in a minute, it's talking about fable where the vision for that is no"
922.48,923.48, cutscenes at all.
923.48,928.0," Well, yeah, these cutscenes, they book in the levels and then when you start the levels,"
928.0,929.0, it's a lot like God of War.
929.0,933.24," In fact, the game kind of begins a lot like God of War and the combat, it's easy to pick"
933.24,936.6800000000001," up and just like you're matching buttons having fun but then when you realize, oh, you"
936.6800000000001,940.4," have three different stances, you're all these complex combos and you unlock more combos"
940.4,941.4, as you go through the game.
941.4,943.88," There's a lot of depth there, it's very rewarding."
943.88,948.16, The only negative I would say to the combat is the enemies aren't that tough to beat.
948.16,951.28," So if you used like Ninja Gaiden, the enemies aren't fighting back that hard."
951.28,953.28, Most of the grons are just grons that they're in your way.
953.28,954.28," See, that's weird."
954.28,959.16," I only, I didn't play that as much as you did but maybe 10 minutes and I found the enemies"
959.16,960.9599999999999, were blocking way too much.
960.9599999999999,962.56, Maybe they turned the AI up.
962.56,964.12, I didn't play here because it looked like the same thing.
964.12,967.3199999999999," Yeah, I played a here today and then like the enemies are just blocking so much so."
967.3199999999999,969.92," You're all in stance because like you haven't, no, no, I know, yeah, I was using"
969.92,972.8, different stances like to use the range stance and the power stance.
972.8,975.88, But there's actual visual indicators to tell you which stance you should be using to fight
975.88,976.88, this different way.
976.88,978.68, I might not have a pulse that were.
978.68,982.3199999999999," There's a little glow of different colors and you learn like, oh, if it's a little blue"
982.3199999999999,984.3199999999999," scene, I should be using speed stance."
984.3199999999999,986.5999999999999," That's what glows your sword, your sword."
986.5999999999999,990.4399999999999, The enemy right for you hit him and there's a lot of audio cues too.
990.4399999999999,994.8399999999999, You can count or most enemies attacks if you attack at the right moment.
994.8399999999999,998.1999999999999," Yeah, there's definitely you learn how to play this game but the combat is really fun"
998.1999999999999,1000.16, and rewarding but that isn't my favorite part of the game.
1000.16,1002.9599999999999, My favorite part of the game is the after touch system.
1002.9599999999999,1005.92, When you pick up anything in the game and you can pick up every object and pick up every
1005.92,1008.68, enemy when you throw them at the X button.
1008.68,1013.7199999999999," If you hold down X, you then become that object and you guide that object with the success"
1013.7199999999999,1017.52, that's the best use of success as an encounter because it's really fun and it takes you
1017.52,1020.52, out of a little bit because you can do things that you wouldn't normally be able to do
1020.52,1023.8399999999999, like you can steer a cannibal around a corner and hit somebody with it.
1023.8399999999999,1027.76, But that's really fun and there's these parts where you're controlling a catapult and
1027.76,1030.96, you're fighting thousands of troops in a battle and you're controlling the cannibals and
1030.96,1031.96, blowing things up.
1031.96,1035.68," It's really fun and you know, when you get to a room and you can break the tables and"
1035.76,1040.44, pick up swords and throw the swords to people and kill them and it's really really fun.
1040.44,1043.68," Yeah, my biggest concern about this game and I haven't had chance to go play it demo was"
1043.68,1046.5600000000002, that just every time they're shown it seemed like it had a potential to just be in a
1046.5600000000002,1047.5600000000002, arena game.
1047.5600000000002,1049.8," So, there is no platforming."
1049.8,1053.88," So, that when you first start playing this game and you realize I can't jump for 10 minutes"
1053.88,1055.68, or like why can't I jump?
1055.68,1059.48, But you can evade the right stick is like evasion and the evasion is very effective and
1059.48,1062.1200000000001, you know as soon as you realize okay I'm not going to be platforming and all the there
1062.1200000000001,1065.3600000000001, are platforming parts but they're all those quick time events that are called a hero
1065.3999999999999,1066.36, sequences.
1066.36,1069.7199999999998, But whether there's platforming or not is there is there actually some like inventuring
1069.7199999999998,1073.8, in the environment or is it simply cutscene encounters cutscene encounters?
1073.8,1077.76, I will say it is mostly that there is not a lot of exploration and there's not a lot of
1077.76,1081.52, platforming you know it's kind of a ride that you play through.
1081.52,1082.9599999999998, It did seem like God of War.
1082.9599999999998,1088.9599999999998, It's a lot of fun to fight basically where you just running down essentially down the tunnel
1088.9599999999998,1090.4399999999998, on having a sequence of battles.
1090.4399999999998,1094.6399999999999, There's a lot of a ride because you do do those sequences where you're sniping and there's
1094.72,1099.4, big boss battles and there's different types of fights and different types of levels.
1099.4,1102.64, So the variety is more than you'd expected isn't just an arena game it isn't the same
1102.64,1103.64, thing going over.
1103.64,1106.72, Can you explain the whole soul thing I'm still not clarinet so she has the soul that
1106.72,1109.64, she's not supposed to have and it's well killing it right?
1109.64,1113.0800000000002, Yeah at the beginning of the game I think I'm allowed to talk about this.
1113.0800000000002,1116.44, They mentioned it in the conference and I then generally like the tattoos come up over
1116.44,1117.44, about it.
1117.44,1122.2800000000002, Like her tribe is being killed by this giant army and like you begin the game fighting
1122.28,1127.28," against 4,000 troops and you die because you're outnumbered she doesn't have the heavenly"
1127.28,1133.12, sword and she decides to use the heavenly sword which is this God sword that she knows
1133.12,1137.24, is cursed that her father's been protecting and when that happens she becomes cursed but
1137.24,1141.76, she becomes amazingly powerful but she knows by using this she's going she's going out
1141.76,1142.76, to die.
1142.76,1143.76, It's constantly draining a hell.
1143.76,1147.36, It doesn't drain your health but it's like you know corrupting her and killing her.
1147.36,1149.36, It's more just a plot-based thing.
1149.4399999999998,1152.9599999999998, But when you don't have the sword at the beginning you only have one stand so when you actually
1152.9599999999998,1156.84, do get the sword you know you don't unlock all these other moves.
1156.84,1160.24, It's interesting but yeah so far I'm very impressed but she get the review code soon
1160.24,1161.24, I'm looking forward to playing.
1161.24,1162.24, What's it now?
1162.24,1163.24, September 28th.
1163.24,1169.6, I also don't agree with you on the combat because I catch up on old games before I came to
1169.6,1175.8, E3 I was playing a God award too and it feels to me like it moves so much faster that
1175.8,1180.76, it like having these sword just feels kind of a little bit slower and more cumbersome.
1180.76,1184.96, It's still a neat game overall but I kind of prefer a God award too's combat.
1184.96,1186.44, It's just quicker faster.
1186.44,1190.08, There's a different feel and the animation is really elaborating.
1190.08,1191.08, That's part of it yeah.
1191.08,1193.9199999999998, It's pretty but it's a little bit of a tradeoff because it is a little slower than God
1193.9199999999998,1194.9199999999998, over.
1194.9199999999998,1199.32, If you like these sort of games I saw on came at THQ which actually was the best game
1199.32,1201.28, in their booth area.
1201.28,1203.12, There's not even two out to the next year but it's called Dark Ciders.
1203.12,1204.9199999999998, Did you check this out at the THQ?
1204.92,1208.88, But I mentioned it to Brian EGM's previous editor and he said you were crazy.
1208.88,1209.88, He said I'm crazy really.
1209.88,1212.68, I haven't seen other people like well I haven't seen it.
1212.68,1213.68, Whatever.
1213.68,1214.68, I think it's really cool.
1214.68,1216.68, It's not even due out to late next year.
1216.68,1219.8000000000002, It already has like some very cool looking enemy designs.
1219.8000000000002,1223.3600000000001, The whole premise of the game is that it starts with the apocalypse and the end of humanity
1223.3600000000001,1228.4, and you play the war which is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
1228.4,1231.6000000000001, But is this the game that was once the forehorse from the fuck up is from a claim?
1231.6000000000001,1232.6000000000001, It sounds so good.
1232.6000000000001,1233.6000000000001, It sounds so good.
1233.6399999999999,1234.4399999999998, But if it...
1234.4399999999998,1236.4399999999998," You know, I might go with that one."
1236.4399999999998,1237.4399999999998, No one would have said that.
1237.4399999999998,1240.4399999999998, This is like their own game for this.
1240.4399999999998,1242.4399999999998, So you play war.
1242.4399999999998,1245.1999999999998, They're going to redesign the character because one thing I told you guys like do right now the
1245.1999999999998,1246.76, character does not look like war at all.
1246.76,1250.8799999999999, So they have to redo that part but you have your warhorse that you can summon.
1250.8799999999999,1251.8799999999999, You're basically...
1251.8799999999999,1256.32, War look like the Jackie from Dead The Dodontness.
1256.32,1262.7199999999998, Actually right now right now war looks like a demonic version of Samus Arn.
1262.88,1263.76, It's up like...
1263.76,1265.4, What the hell is this like?
1265.4,1265.92, Yeah.
1265.92,1267.6000000000001, And the game has like a very...
1267.6000000000001,1270.0, Very Metroidish kind of vibe to it.
1270.0,1274.4, It's like right now it really looks and feels to me like I was like wow this is like...
1274.4,1276.0, Metroid crossed with God of War.
1276.0,1277.52, What an interesting combination.
1277.52,1279.2, And it takes place.
1279.2,1280.56, It takes place in Earth right?
1280.56,1283.1200000000001, So like he's going around this giant sword that he can summon.
1283.1200000000001,1285.04, Kicking that shit out of these demons.
1285.04,1289.6000000000001, And then he has to also fight angels because you're on Earth and it's after the apocalypse.
1289.6000000000001,1292.0, So the angels and demons are fighting over Earth.
1292.08,1295.12, And the angels are like super advanced like technologically.
1295.12,1299.6, And so then he comes into like an area that's like an abandoned army base or whatever.
1299.6,1304.08, And he grabs a mini gun off of a helicopter and starts fighting the angels after he's just been
1304.08,1305.28, raising hell on the demons.
1305.28,1306.48, It has some cool potential.
1306.48,1308.48, I thought it looked pretty neat.
1308.48,1311.36, It sounds like something that Todd McFallow would write.
1312.16,1314.4, It does sort of sound like that.
1314.4,1316.0, And that really made that a good way.
1318.0,1321.04, There are a lot of God of War clones here and it's hard for one to stick out.
1322.0,1323.2, I mean Conan who's doing that one?
1323.2,1324.24, Because it's Conan.
1324.24,1326.0, Conan is right there in the same also.
1326.0,1327.6, Conan was right there and it's all the same to each you.
1327.6,1328.48, And it's like what?
1328.48,1329.68, This is not Conan.
1329.68,1332.56, Because Conan is just gold of Conan or Conan of War.
1332.56,1334.96, I mean it's like so obviously a knockoff.
1334.96,1336.32, For the divorce of the Conan Brian.
1336.96,1339.28, And there's a don't do the god of cowboy.
1339.28,1340.08, God of cowboy.
1340.08,1340.8799999999999, God of cowboy.
1340.8799999999999,1342.3999999999999, Conan is kind of a man.
1342.3999999999999,1342.8799999999999, How is that?
1342.8799999999999,1346.1599999999999," Because when they first showed Hellboy, I thought they had a lot of promise."
1346.1599999999999,1347.92, Like chrome in there and they were pretty good developer.
1347.92,1348.72, But yeah.
1348.8,1350.56," People were calling us out last night for saying,"
1350.56,1351.76, chrome's a good studio.
1351.76,1354.8, And I've always been impressed with what crime is put out.
1354.8,1355.76, I tied the Tasmanian.
1355.76,1358.88," I enjoyed both, both won and two, which crumbed it both of them."
1358.88,1359.52, Yes.
1359.52,1360.64, And then it was King Arthur.
1360.64,1361.52, That was awesome.
1361.52,1362.0, No.
1364.0,1366.16, I tried to know why people say that dude.
1366.16,1367.52, It's because they have games like that.
1367.52,1369.68," I mean, but people were calling out same toys or good game."
1369.68,1371.04," Well yeah, Ty was a good game."
1371.04,1371.84, He was.
1371.84,1372.32, He really was.
1372.32,1374.8, A lot of people didn't play it because they thought it was a baby game
1374.8,1376.56, and didn't want to be seen playing that kind of thing.
1376.56,1381.6799999999998," But it was a more than competent, you know, Jack and Dax,"
1381.6799999999998,1384.1599999999999," the Russian and Plancky kind of knockoff, right?"
1384.1599999999999,1384.3999999999999, Shoot.
1384.3999999999999,1384.8799999999999, I'm kidding.
1384.8799999999999,1386.6399999999999, Did you get the chance by a little big planet?
1386.6399999999999,1387.04, No.
1387.04,1388.08, I really wish that you had.
1388.08,1389.2, You got his play it.
1389.2,1389.6799999999998, I have.
1389.6799999999998,1390.32, Is that the hanger?
1390.32,1393.36, Is it the hotel thing?
1393.36,1393.6, Yes.
1393.6,1394.3999999999999, It's not in the arcade.
1394.3999999999999,1395.28, I am going there tomorrow.
1395.28,1398.3999999999999, I'm going to play everything I possibly can in the sunny in the sunny arcade.
1398.3999999999999,1398.8, Not there.
1399.9199999999998,1400.72, Brian played it to that.
1400.72,1401.9199999999998," Anyway, you should play as you because you're the"
1401.9199999999998,1403.44, downing Tomas on this game.
1403.44,1404.6399999999999, So I'm just trying to run.
1404.6399999999999,1405.76, I don't think he's still.
1405.84,1408.32," You're not really the doubting Thomas completely, aren't you?"
1408.32,1410.72, I'm not as excited about it as everyone else is.
1410.72,1415.36, I think a part of your insides are dead too.
1415.36,1418.08, That part of my brain died a long time ago.
1418.08,1421.76," I mean, like the last I saw of it was a GDC demo and I'm like,"
1421.76,1426.24," well, it's just like you're just just like charging through a level, you know?"
1426.24,1429.12, Just like jump like it didn't look like it took a lot of skill.
1429.12,1432.08, You just just run and jump and run and jump like go get changed.
1432.08,1433.44," Just push, just push, just push."
1433.44,1435.44, Eventually you're going to make it to the end and there's a
1435.44,1437.44, point where everyone has to work together anyway.
1437.44,1440.16," So it's kind of like, well, it doesn't matter what kind of lead you have."
1440.16,1443.44, You're going to have to wait for everybody so you can all do this puzzle and then you
1443.44,1445.28, restart the race over at that point.
1445.28,1449.3600000000001," And I understand, you know, that's just the one demo they made."
1449.3600000000001,1450.88, Like there's a lot of possibilities.
1450.88,1453.1200000000001," You can make a more, you know, we just did a preview of"
1453.1200000000001,1454.48, the GM where they talked about.
1454.48,1457.28," We can make, they can make levels that are more"
1457.28,1460.3200000000002," Mario, like where they're really skill based."
1460.3200000000002,1462.72," You know, so when I see that, I think I'll get more excited."
1462.72,1466.24," But from the game developers conference demo, I was just like,"
1466.24,1468.4, it's sharp looking.
1468.4,1471.68," The textures look fantastic, you know, those fabrics look real, but"
1471.68,1474.48," that's adorable, but you know, I'm not that excited."
1474.48,1476.88," I've played it here, but I can say like,"
1476.88,1481.28," if it's a better or whatever this year, like playing that game more than anything else on PS3,"
1481.28,1483.2," just like, you're different though now."
1483.2,1484.72," When you have this right now, yeah."
1484.72,1488.4," Now that you have kids, you tend to look for more."
1488.4,1490.24," When you play different things, what did you get to play with?"
1490.24,1493.52, I got to make my own levels with more of the producers and
1493.52,1496.32," you know, it's so easy to use and quick and fun and,"
1496.32,1497.84," like, I, all right, so how to work?"
1497.84,1500.32, Is it as easy as that there was a video where it was just going to be
1500.32,1502.08," where it was like select the texture and go,"
1502.08,1504.24," yeah, I mean, like, and you've made something."
1504.24,1507.44," Pick a shape and like when you're picking the different shapes and materials,"
1507.44,1509.04," something's there and you can like,"
1509.04,1511.68," using the analog sticks, grow it larger smaller,"
1511.68,1514.32," just add a metatium, and just put things on."
1514.32,1518.24," It's something, everything's, are you always making essentially two-dimensional objects, though?"
1518.24,1521.1200000000001," Yes, I mean, it takes place on there are three planes,"
1521.1200000000001,1523.6," but you know, everything is basically two-dimensional."
1523.6,1527.52," But beyond it's guys, like, you guys are going to go into the editor,"
1527.52,1529.92," you're going to throw some things around and you're going to run your guy through,"
1529.92,1533.68," like, that was kind of cool and it's really easy, but you're not going to take the time."
1533.68,1536.8, None of you guys are going to take the time to do a well-designed
1536.8,1540.96, lengthy properly balanced skill-based level.
1540.96,1543.44," No, I'm just going to throw a lot of shit in there."
1543.44,1546.32," I'm going to run through it and then you're going to be like,"
1546.32,1547.84," well, you know what, I'm going to play other lines."
1547.84,1549.6799999999998," I think the average player won't have the time to, like,"
1549.6799999999998,1553.28," from the ground up, create a whole level, but you can take other people's levels and edit them,"
1553.28,1556.56," and change them. And like, it's really easy to stick things in the level,"
1556.56,1558.9599999999998," and stick things together, and something make a new object."
1558.9599999999998,1562.9599999999998," Like, while we were there, we like, we made this giant drag-and-car thing,"
1562.9599999999998,1565.76," and it kept putting stuff on it, and like, moving around, and you can,"
1565.76,1568.1599999999999," and then you can give that to somebody else, and they have it in their game,"
1568.1599999999999,1570.3999999999999," and like, you can, so I think it's, it's just so expandable,"
1570.3999999999999,1573.52," and like, if you talk to the producer, they really don't know what's going to happen with this game."
1573.52,1575.84," It's kind of like, the Sims are sporesh, something,"
1575.84,1578.6399999999999," and that it's just a big playground, and you don't know what's going to happen."
1578.6399999999999,1581.04," Yeah, yeah, and to be clear, I'm not down on it."
1581.04,1584.24," I'm not saying it's a bad game. I just, I'm not excited about it."
1584.24,1585.28, As much as you want.
1585.28,1587.4399999999998," Well, and I think your mileage may vary. I mean, if you play a bad level,"
1587.4399999999998,1588.6399999999999, you might think this game sucks.
1588.6399999999999,1589.28," Yeah, yeah."
1589.28,1592.1599999999999," So, well, you know, you're saying essentially that you don't think that the audience"
1592.1599999999999,1594.8799999999999, is going to take to it the way that the team thinks they will.
1594.8799999999999,1596.48, Do you think game is a null thing?
1596.48,1599.76," I think I think like, everyone who saw the editor, like I said,"
1599.76,1601.1999999999998, I think people are going to get excited.
1601.1999999999998,1604.32," You want to try it. You're going to do a couple of simple levels,"
1604.32,1607.4399999999998," but very few of us, and we're all pretty hardcore,"
1607.4399999999998,1608.48, and we're all in to our games.
1608.48,1613.84," I think very few of us, even, will want to design a proper level."
1613.84,1616.08, That's actually fun for others to play.
1616.08,1618.08, I think I'm going to throw a bunch of blocks on there.
1618.08,1622.08," Throw some pornographic stickers on the blocks, and then like,"
1622.08,1625.04," check this out, and then barrel through it, and realize like,"
1625.04,1627.04, that wasn't really a well-designed stage.
1627.04,1629.36," Messed with it some more, and then after that, I'm like,"
1629.36,1631.84," you know what? I'm just going to play the levels that came with a game,"
1631.84,1633.04, and downloads some of the best of all.
1633.04,1634.08, Be kind of the stickers and stuff.
1634.08,1637.84, Have they said if you can pull photos out of your hard drive
1637.84,1641.6," and apply them to the environment, they say they want to include that,"
1641.6,1645.6, and they hope to have ways of policing it to stop shoe
1645.6,1647.28, for posting pornographic.
1647.28,1648.6399999999999, They hope to have.
1648.6399999999999,1650.96," Oh, look at my little cute guy. What's he crawling up?"
1650.96,1654.1599999999999," Oh, nice."
1654.1599999999999,1656.1599999999999," What's this big, rainy mountain?"
1656.1599999999999,1658.1599999999999, Oh.
1659.12,1662.1599999999999, There's another weirdly ambitious game that's hidden from view that you
1662.16,1663.92," got to play John, which is fable too."
1663.92,1665.0400000000002, I did get to play that.
1665.0400000000002,1668.16, Yes. Which is strangely on the dial.
1668.16,1670.5600000000002," Well, it's very, very, very early."
1670.5600000000002,1672.72," Like he actually opened the demo with,"
1672.72,1676.72, you're going to see a lot of games at E3 at varying levels of
1676.72,1681.1200000000001," technical proficiency, and I absolutely guarantee that this is the worst"
1681.1200000000001,1684.0800000000002, tech demo you will see. And he being ultimate
1684.0800000000002,1688.8000000000002, over-promiser Peter Moulnou promises the world every time.
1688.8799999999999,1693.68," So we open, again, it's very sort of grand."
1693.68,1699.04, I want to challenge the very foundation of how you play video games.
1699.04,1702.24," But he, I mean, you would say in the I've changed because I've got kids."
1702.24,1704.3999999999999," Peter Moulnou, I think, has changed because he's got kids."
1704.3999999999999,1706.3999999999999," There's a lot of people in the industry that you're hearing about,"
1706.3999999999999,1709.9199999999998, where because they're getting older and they've been around games
1709.9199999999998,1712.3999999999999," a long time and they're at a different point in their life now,"
1712.3999999999999,1715.44, you can see it's starting to affect the way they're approaching the design of the
1715.44,1717.52, games. And I think this is what's happening here.
1717.6,1721.6, The two things that he wanted to do is he wants anyone to be able to pick up.
1721.6,1725.44," It's like it's a big intimidating role playing game, but he wants anyone to be able to pick it up"
1725.44,1729.28," and get something out of it and to be able to enjoy it. And then the other thing was,"
1730.72,1733.92," I don't know if you've ever, I mean, people listening have ever heard Peter Moulnou talking,"
1733.92,1737.92," he's sort of, you know, there's very polite Englishman who's a bit C3PO like in the way that he"
1737.92,1742.96," pulls the bad things and he's sort of, so I was watching, uh, Ceno Royale."
1742.96,1746.8799999999999," And I was watching James Bond getting hit in the ballads with that, uh, with a huge rope"
1746.96,1751.5200000000002," thing and it dawned on me. And movies, the hero never dies. He's like,"
1751.5200000000002,1755.7600000000002," he paused it and he's like, so that's what I was going to do in Fable 2. So you never die."
1755.7600000000002,1760.8000000000002," You never die in Fable 2, which everyone was, there was like five people in the room,"
1760.8000000000002,1764.24," he was doing this and everyone was sort of like, yeah, and he's like,"
1764.24,1768.0, because the death mechanic in video games has been essentially the same since Donkey Kong.
1768.0,1770.88, It's like you die and you go back to the beginning of the level and you start again. So what
1770.88,1775.8400000000001," happens in Fable is, um, there's a lot of keys said, like 56% of the game is combat."
1776.8,1782.48," And some of the combat is five or six guys and there's a lot of the way that it scales is that,"
1782.48,1787.04," you know, there are, there are fights that you, you, you can wander into that you really shouldn't."
1787.04,1791.12," So the way that it sort of scales, the, the character stuff is that you, you don't really want"
1791.12,1795.12," to go and engage on something that you shouldn't, but if you do get beaten down,"
1796.24,1800.48," instead of dying, you fall and you're like, you're lying on the ground and you're"
1800.56,1805.52," depending on the, the character attributes, you will eventually get up. What?"
1806.16,1809.84," You will eventually get up, but fall and then you will eventually get up on your own."
1809.84,1812.88," And, but if you want to get up a metal or bracelet and which I should set up five,"
1812.88,1819.1200000000001," let me finish. If you want to get up faster, you can trade experience or gold or something"
1819.1200000000001,1825.04," in your inventory in order to get up faster. So you're in this fight, you get beaten down."
1825.04,1829.2," If you want to get up immediately, then you need to trade experience points to get up."
1829.2,1833.76," If you don't get up and you have to wait to get up, the characters continue to beat on you"
1834.56,1841.28," and over the course of you being beaten, any, any injuries that you sustain while lying on the ground,"
1841.28,1846.64, are permanent for the entire life of the character. So you have scars. You become disfigured and
1846.64,1850.56," the more like, does it affect your stats? Yeah. So the more disfigured you are,"
1851.1200000000001,1856.8," anything on the, on charm or personality is affected by your physical appearance. So if you're"
1856.8799999999999,1861.68," allows you to combat and keep walking into fights that you shouldn't get into, you'll get beaten up"
1861.68,1869.36, and you won't be able to engage in missions that require like charm or personality or persuasion
1869.36,1872.8799999999999, or because people will take one look at you and they'll think that you're a soldier or you're
1872.8799999999999,1877.44, some kind of like evil character and because you get like really fucked up apparently and like
1877.44,1880.72, there were people will take one look at you and they're not going to want to do anything with you. So
1880.72,1885.9199999999998, the consequence of falling in battle is more than just losing something and studying again.
1886.4,1890.4, There are parts of the game that will be way more difficult because of the way that you look.
1891.52,1896.4, I like the Donkey Kong style better because so you have to make a choice.
1896.4,1901.1200000000001," Praise the hell, but you want to give up some of your experience points which no one's going to want to do."
1901.1200000000001,1904.4," I don't want to do that. To get up fast, to get up faster, otherwise sit there and then just"
1904.4,1909.68," continue to get used to it. So you can get, you can like wander into fights that you, you know,"
1909.68,1913.04, you need to pick your battles essentially is what you need to do is you only need to wander into
1913.04,1918.0, fights that you think you have a pretty good chance of pulling off and the way that it guides you is
1918.0,1920.8, that you won't just dump you in the middle of a fight that you can't.
1921.84,1926.6399999999999, Well so that parts look at idea where it kind of makes you a little bit more tentative and afraid
1926.6399999999999,1932.8799999999999, because we know okay well if this boss is too big for me I just reload the last save. It makes
1932.8799999999999,1937.04, you a little bit more cautious maybe that's a little bit more realistic but still it's like you
1937.04,1941.12, know when you die and crack down and you lose some of those orbs that you built up it it would
1941.12,1945.6799999999998, kind of sucks you know like like Sonic the ring you don't pick up all the rings and you have
1945.6799999999998,1949.6799999999998, the first out of your body I mean it's taking that guess that idea to the but like it's
1949.6799999999998,1953.6799999999998, in favor like that's all you want to do is level up your character and build a stronger character
1953.6799999999998,1957.6, I don't want to go take it if you're wondering in this if you're wondering a device that you shouldn't
1958.1599999999999,1964.08, you are essentially committing to a more combat oriented story for yourself. Here's what here's
1964.08,1969.1999999999998, what's on to me about this is on the one hand you have the option of spending experience points
1969.28,1975.6000000000001, which is a very like abstract game mechanic sort of idea but if you don't spend them then you take
1975.6000000000001,1982.64, damage to your you know to your avatar in the game that impacts your game as if you are actually
1982.64,1986.88, laying on the ground in the game environment being beaten but it's not like I'm just like paying
1986.88,1991.28, some magic fairy to lift me off of the ground with experience it's just worth that's a weird
1991.28,1992.96, trade-off he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't he didn't
1992.96,1998.0800000000002, find specifically what the cost would be he said that we'll be a cost to getting up immediately or
1998.1599999999999,2002.24, getting up very quickly and he's just said it'll be gold or experience or something I haven't thought
2002.24,2005.52, of it yet it was a very sort of a beautiful and you moment you know it was like yeah there'll be
2005.52,2009.9199999999998, something that you do and he is he has these really wildly ambitious innovative concepts but then you
2009.9199999999998,2014.08, say like the actual mechanics of the game it doesn't look very good and you don't even think it's going
2014.08,2019.28, to be out in the next I don't think it's very early right now and the he did the other thing he
2019.28,2024.48, demod was the one button combat so melee attacks I'm mapped to the expert and range attacks I'm
2024.48,2030.56, mapped to why and magic is is mapped to be and everything is based on combinations of pressing one of
2030.56,2034.88, the buttons and a direction and it's all contextual and all procedural there's no like
2034.88,2041.1200000000001, predetermined moves so if you hold the X button he'll do a block and it's context sensitive to both
2041.1200000000001,2045.1200000000001, the environment and to where the characters are and then it'll break the camera off the action
2045.1200000000001,2049.6, and try and show the fight in the best possible place and then as you're doing these sort of like
2049.6,2053.12, if you you can press and hold to do a block and then from a block you're going to remove
2053.12,2058.16, it's more spectacular you start chaining these these moves together with directions and when you're
2058.16,2064.56, fighting multiple people it's based on who you're pointing the stick towards as to what you'll do so
2064.56,2069.8399999999997, he'll if I if the two if I have one of you on either side of me and if I'm blocking and holding
2069.8399999999997,2075.6, towards you I'll hold the sword up like that and if the guy on the other side rushes towards me
2075.6,2080.56, I'll try and push him in my hand and it's all it's all based on relational to where he's standing
2080.64,2084.88, the other thing is it's the the environment plays into it in a big way as as well so
2086.24,2090.24, if I'm walking along and there's a bottle on a table and I hit the range attack if I don't have
2090.24,2094.08, a gun or a bow and arrow I'll just pick up the I'll pick up the bottle and throw it at the nearest guy
2094.08,2099.12, in the environment and so everything is based on that and then this gradually ramps up until eventually
2099.12,2104.7999999999997, it becomes the demo that was a video of the demo he did at GDC the bar fight with the stick figures
2105.6,2110.08, I didn't see one but well he had this vision of a bar fight that was like an arrow flin moving
2110.16,2114.96, essentially where it would be using everything in the environment as part of a fight and you could have
2114.96,2120.96, this spectacular like old school movie sword fights swinging on the chandeliers and throwing bottles
2120.96,2125.84, and stuff getting broken and everything and someone could do it by essentially just doing it with
2125.84,2131.68, one button and he said they have that working now where if you you can jump you know he'll jump up on a
2131.68,2137.36, table and if the if the fastest path to attack the character that that you're facing is to leap
2137.44,2141.92, on the chandelier and swing and kick him then that's what the character will do but everything's
2141.92,2147.6800000000003, based on the physics and it's all procedural based on on where you are so very often you know
2147.6800000000003,2151.1200000000003, you'll hit a button and he might do the character might do something unexpected or you know is that
2151.1200000000003,2155.44, the attack is going to be on what you were intending to attack so the question says become how much
2155.44,2160.4, do you want to have to be responsible for actually making the cool shit that you see on screen
2160.4,2163.52, how and he handed it over because he goes what I want to do is I'm going to get you into a
2163.52,2166.88, middle of a fight and I'm I'm going to pause the game and I'm going to give it to you and I'm
2166.88,2171.12, not going to tell you what to do and I want you to he's like I don't like button measures I don't
2171.12,2175.36, want you to just mash it you can play it like that but if you want to see the cool moves
2175.36,2178.48, then you need to be thinking about how you're pressing the button and it was it was quite
2178.48,2183.36, interesting because you could you could push the guy against the wall and then hold the button down
2183.36,2187.7599999999998, and he'd force his sword up on the guy's throat and then you could do you could pull the stick
2187.7599999999998,2192.16, away and while he was finishing that guy off he would move around and attack the guy behind him
2192.16,2197.52, and he'd do things like you'd see him blocking and then as a guy came towards him he'd throw his
2197.52,2202.3199999999997, sword from one hand to the other and then start attacking the other it was very old aerol flin
2202.3199999999997,2207.68, movie kind of stuff and it's quite satisfying even it's not just I'm just going to jabble one
2207.68,2211.7599999999998, but it's not got a war jabbing on a button and just doing the same attack over and over and over
2211.7599999999998,2217.2799999999997, it's quite graceful and it's quite slow it's very sort of dancy in a way it's like a Assassin's
2217.84,2223.6800000000003, combat no I haven't played Assassin's Creed but I would I think the principle behind it from
2223.6800000000003,2228.7200000000003, what how people have described Assassin's Creed is very similar because that's very procedural and
2228.7200000000003,2232.88, context it's very context sensitive from what I've heard and this seems to be something a lot of
2232.88,2238.88, people are doing now and that they had to be accessible is to think of the controller differently
2238.88,2242.96, I mean at the beginning of the demo it was like we we have not got everything we can get out of
2243.04,2248.48, these controllers yet this thing has like whatever it is 12 buttons on it and we're not doing it so
2248.48,2253.6, one of the things is the things and this is what Hayler was guys said as well is you don't want to
2253.6,2259.2, change where things are you always want certain behaviors to be the same thing so in fable the
2259.2,2265.84, deep had is an emotional response and X is always a melee attack and Y is or you know so the emotional
2265.84,2271.12, stuff that he talked about was um if you want to be a real dick in the game you can use the
2271.2,2275.68, emotions as well as the aggressive stuff and he was talking about there's an old woman who's
2275.68,2280.3199999999997, talking about her son who is lost in the forest and she's telling this terrible terrible story
2280.3199999999997,2286.3199999999997, you guys if you tap left on the deep had your character will start laughing and uh and the
2286.3199999999997,2290.48, character and the woman will respond to the fact that you're laughing at her story so he said you know
2290.48,2294.96, you have a laugh and a cough and a fart and it's like various things mapped to the deep had it
2294.96,2299.6, we've been going to have it before and based on what you what you do well other people are doing
2299.6,2304.0, things it will affect the way that they perceive you and it's I mean it's taking a lot of the
2304.0,2310.4, ideas from fable and just like pushing them as hard as he can it's very ambitious and so you have
2310.4,2314.56, high hopes for anything he's going to for a long time I admire his vision and if he fills off some of
2314.56,2320.4, it like like mulling you for the last 20 years he'll throw out these great ideas some of them will
2320.4,2324.4, work some of them that don't the ones that do work we're going to see in every game out there
2324.7200000000003,2329.84, you know all right well that's how the good spot to take a little break in the minute we'll come back we'll
2329.84,2334.8, talk we got to get some halo wars in there since I know she got a little halo so you play crisis today
2334.8,2339.44, I did play some crisis today and then we talked about sandbox games we can't leave sandboxes without
2339.44,2343.76, talking about burnout so yeah so don't go anywhere stick around we'll be right back
2344.7200000000003,2360.0800000000004, this one at podcast is brought to you by Windows Media Center your Xbox 360 your music your photos
2360.0800000000004,2363.0400000000004, your TV shows and your videos with one connection
2364.0,2376.4, all right we're back and I I'm gonna spoke myself a little bit shoot it not actually get
2376.4,2381.12, to play halo wars but you did get to check it out which not many people have done either so
2381.12,2387.52, give us the skinny how's it looking so if you're a halo fan I think you're going to
2387.52,2391.52, really and you like RTS games obviously a real 10 strategy yeah obviously you're going to like
2391.68,2395.28, and I know that's just like the simplest thing to say it's such an easy thing to say but
2395.28,2400.48, it's really like you know they took all the source material they did it really well like all
2400.48,2405.2, this they took the original sound files from bungee so like for example when your troops meet up
2405.2,2410.8, with a group of grunts and elites it sounds like a real halo fight you know like what you see
2410.8,2415.12, in the first what you hear in the first person shooters like the needlers sound like needlers
2415.12,2420.4, from the firing of the needles to when it hits you and it got the crystals kind of break apart
2421.04,2426.56, the wart hogs they start exactly like the game the halo twos wart hogs and they even had
2426.56,2430.1600000000003, the same suspension and same physics like what's the same physics system they showed a
2431.28,2435.52, there's a break in the environment in the demo level that they showed and yet they fired these
2435.52,2440.88, two wart hogs and they like both hit the lip and both pushed up into the air and they bounced
2440.88,2444.32, down the other side and the way they hit on the other side they landed on their front wheels
2444.32,2448.64, and almost like bounced over forwards before crashing back down so there's like real
2448.72,2452.48, they look like the vehicle it looks like you're watching a halo game from like a hundred feet in
2452.48,2457.2799999999997, the exact like the physics are exact like when you run into people when the war hawks flip around
2457.2799999999997,2463.7599999999998, it does feel like halo just you're watching it from all really far this camera angle any
2463.7599999999998,2467.44, different than you'd expect it to zoom in at times or anything you can change it you could do the
2467.44,2472.64, typical like just like command and conquer and lord of the rings for a 360 you could spin it around
2472.64,2477.44, you could zoom in a little closer a little farther away that's that's the thing for me it's like
2477.52,2482.64, once you get past the halo stuff we didn't get to see a whole lot in terms of like why this is
2482.64,2486.0, a special one I want to go back to the camera stuff though because they talked about this a little bit
2486.0,2491.12, and the way that it's set up and the way that the game itself handles the camera is very
2491.12,2497.52, different from CNC and they said that if you if you're not experienced with an RTS game you will
2497.52,2503.44, never have to touch the right stick to move the camera because it's default setting is actually
2503.44,2508.64, quite close into the combat and it's it's a bit more skirmish and come company heroes like in the
2508.64,2513.36, way that it's like these series of they're not these huge battles stuff that they showed I mean
2513.36,2517.12, they're there were there were some sizable stuff but it wasn't like thousands of troops or
2517.12,2522.16, pilot into each other but the way that the camera is set up is it's always looking at the
2522.16,2526.2400000000002, the action from from a good vantage point and they said that you you will be able to play it
2526.2400000000002,2531.2000000000003, without having to worry about spinning the camera or getting disoriented or anything and it's the
2531.2,2536.56, levels of very the stuff they showed was this sort of sequence of events so what would happen
2536.56,2541.52, I didn't catch that part like is there something you do to zoom in on well you can you can zoom in
2541.52,2545.2, and out but they said that in what they found was very confusing when they were looking at
2545.2,2548.7999999999997, that things like CNC was when you start spinning the camera you start to loose track
2548.7999999999997,2553.2, where everything is in the world and it's because it's not it's not as easy as like skipping
2553.2,2557.12, a mouse around and being able to know you like get lost in it so what they wanted to do
2557.12,2561.7599999999998, was build the level and build the camera system so that you don't have to do that kind of thing
2561.7599999999998,2566.48, in order to play the game and see what's going on how much did they talk about the control scheme
2566.48,2570.16, because that was like the three the reason that they said ensemble wanted to do this game was that
2570.16,2576.88, they had figured out the way to do really simple there's like none of the holding down the trigger
2576.88,2580.88, and then popping one button and hitting the other issues with the things that had the Lord of the Rings
2581.2799999999997,2586.4," I think they did it really well because I'm able to like access groups, heroes, powers"
2587.04,2591.6800000000003, so they didn't really have to take strip anything away from a PC game to make Lord of the Rings
2591.6800000000003,2598.7200000000003, Battleful Milliter 2 for 360 everything's just in you know in a palm of your hands but in
2598.7200000000003,2604.8, Halo it is simpler it's like you know you could double tap A just like all units on the screen and you
2604.8,2610.1600000000003, could draw it has the paint feature where it draws a big circle and then if you just move this
2610.1600000000003,2615.6800000000003, circle around the units on a screen everything it touches selects that group and then you have this
2616.64,2620.72, available to you or you know you can I think there are ways to select all units like
2620.72,2626.16, I triple tap and it'll select every active unit in the game world I don't think we're triple
2626.16,2630.8799999999997, taped in my life I was saying new new thing to do now triple tapping so it's like you can
2630.8799999999997,2634.7999999999997, do that and everything in view will go and then you do it again and it'll like every every
2634.7999999999997,2641.3599999999997, unit that's available you can say come because the demo ended with what was it called a scarab
2642.08,2647.44, which is this big robotic full-legged thing with this huge fucking plasma cannon that's like burning
2647.44,2652.08, up the environment and like destroying everything in its path and it's sort of all the fine
2652.08,2656.1600000000003, and you said if you if you wanted to at that point you can select every active unit and just point it on
2656.1600000000003,2660.32, that one thing so how are the graphics compared to CNC and Lord of the Rings the graphics are really
2660.32,2664.6400000000003, good they're really detailed like yeah like from a like from our vantage point you can say like
2664.6400000000003,2670.08, those are grunts those are elites there's a band she goes like it's very clear very sharp and
2671.04,2675.2799999999997, like their little cool touches too as you expect in a real time strategy game like when you
2675.2799999999997,2679.68, when you pan over the marine base like behind the barracks you'll see a drill sergeant and you'll see
2679.68,2685.92, a like four or five guys doing push-ups and and then in another I don't know what this building
2685.92,2692.16, does but you had a crane moving crates around and they put it on a they put it on a ground onto a
2692.16,2697.6, conveyor belt you see this missile that's sitting in the base on a partially underground and there's
2697.68,2703.2799999999997, steam coming out of it and you know a lot of little touches so it's done really well but I think
2703.2799999999997,2708.72, really honestly besides the scarab was really cool and you know they ended a demo with an orbital
2709.7599999999998,2715.12, they call it a Mac gun from your ship that's orbiting in space it's a magnetic acceleration
2715.12,2720.88, accelerator a accelerated cannon whatever so it blasted down and destroyed the scarab but
2721.76,2727.92, if I was to replace all those units with generic soldiers or you know aliens or whatever
2727.92,2732.56, and just call it something else I don't think anyone would really care you know it's it's
2732.56,2736.56, pretty straightforward real time strategy game it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a
2736.56,2741.52, a I might my take on it was that this is for a lot of fans it's for not for RTS fans I mean you know
2741.52,2746.2400000000002, you might you might get something to it if you're into RT but the primary audience is the
2746.3199999999997,2751.04, 4 million people who are gonna buy hello three the one more halo yeah but I mean there's
2751.04,2755.68, probably a lot we didn't see you to be a to be fair yeah I mean the demo they showed it and then
2755.68,2761.2, they were like on that's it and like really that was like five minutes well when did you
2761.2,2766.16, come out that's a next year right yeah yeah yeah I mean I don't think I'm gonna give it some space
2766.16,2769.7599999999998, between three and this yeah yeah so it gives you a chance to come back to halo and get excited
2769.7599999999998,2773.68, about it and I guess now that we've seen a little more single player there's more to be excited
2773.68,2776.96, about I guess that was the big relief is that everybody who went and saw halo three and single
2776.96,2782.3199999999997, premiere that response overwhelmingly was wow it looks so much better than the multiplayer beta
2782.3199999999997,2786.48, I shouldn't speak in the light the halo universe before we'd go off will we um main Patrick
2786.48,2792.8799999999997, met with Shane Kim today and he categorically said there will be no halo four really yeah
2793.68,2798.16, that they are done do you talk about about the Peter Jackson game project yeah which I assume is
2798.16,2801.7599999999998, halo chronicles which it's been a name to a few times it sounds like that's what the Jackson
2802.4,2806.5600000000004, but that's the future and the reference to Star Wars that that's kind of what they were talking
2806.5600000000004,2813.1200000000003, about and that not only is at the moment the intention is the integrity of the core trilogy will
2813.1200000000003,2817.44, remain the core trilogy but does that open the door for halo episode one with Jojo?
2818.1600000000003,2821.76, potentially down the road maybe when they decide they want more money that's what they do but for
2821.76,2828.1600000000003, but after halo three the master chief story is done and everything that they do will be support
2828.24,2834.8799999999997, stories that are pre halo post halo you know but not in that core story which we didn't
2834.8799999999997,2840.3999999999996, mention halo wars is it's a prequel to the halo series it 20 years before the events of halo
2840.3999999999996,2843.68, one right so does that imply that perhaps master chief dies at the end of halo three?
2843.68,2849.04, I don't know but that's like that is the day halo three it is done it is over it's like the Star
2849.04,2853.92, Wars trilogy it's a complete unit when I'm gonna fuck with that explains the cliffhanger ending
2853.92,2860.96, of you know Empire Strikes back slash halo two yeah oh you're such a cynics so what
2860.96,2865.28, single play so you saw what do you think does it really look that much better what's your
2865.28,2870.88, impression now from halo three single play? Hale three looks really really good but it's a subtle
2870.88,2877.28, beauty you know it's not like an immediate when you see unreal tournament three or gears of war
2877.28,2881.6, you know that's those are the kind of games where immediately you're like wow holy shit this
2881.68,2886.3199999999997, game looks good kills on too is even a bit of that you keep trees almost like graphical sensory
2886.3199999999997,2892.48, overlord there's crazy things in your face it's so ornate that the levels are so realistic so
2892.48,2898.7999999999997, gritty hails not like that it's it's like the problem is why it's not as immediately obvious that
2898.7999999999997,2902.96, halo three looks great is because it's it's a different art style it's more colorful like
2902.96,2907.04, you know like their broots wearing shiny purple armor yeah Chanel it was making fun of like
2907.12,2912.16, the rainbow skittle color you know that's far into how it's taken about the game yeah yeah so it's
2912.16,2917.2799999999997, a different art style but uh and the problem with the Microsoft press conference video they showed
2917.84,2923.04, they showed this I don't know a bit of one side but they just showed a bunch of quick flash clips of
2923.04,2926.48, halo three you know just like a little bit here a little bit there a little bit there and it was really
2926.48,2930.16, no one came away impressed with that because you couldn't really see me yeah we got on them yesterday
2930.16,2934.64, for that I mean that was way too clip way too cut up yeah but wait but when you if you can sit and
2934.72,2940.56, watch the gaming played like it's pretty good it's beautiful because like you're in the way we saw
2940.56,2945.68, this jungle level and the sun's poking through the leaves through the branches and it's like this
2945.68,2952.08, soft so it's that that like harsh game lighting it's like it's very soft and subtle and then it
2952.08,2956.96, casts these nice shadows on a ground when you're in this cave there's these red lights that
2956.96,2963.68, cast like a realistic glow all the textures are really sharp the jungle looks really full like
2963.7599999999998,2968.16, it you know it doesn't look like video game trees or branches or leaves right it's not like a perfect
2968.16,2973.04, dog jungle but I think that is also not like the crisis jungle what's talking about that tomorrow yeah
2973.04,2977.2, but yeah definitely we get some of the PC guys on for that so John did you see the halo you saw
2977.2,2981.12, halo three also I saw both of you so when we were what would you what what's your take away from
2981.12,2985.2799999999997, exact I mean it's out of the same you need the this is why I've seen yesterday I thought the
2985.2799999999997,2990.7999999999997, trailer that they showed was lousy because it does not allow you to see what is good about halo
2991.44,2996.2400000000002, because you can't catch it no second clip of like the arbiter fighting with faster team and they
2996.2400000000002,3000.1600000000003, should have shown like a lot of that so the mission that they showed is it was going through the
3000.1600000000003,3006.0800000000004, jungle and and you were part of this fight it's not a squad but it is a fighting force of marines
3006.0800000000004,3009.92, and the arbiter is there and he's talking and he's like saying oh I'm gonna go over here and I'm
3009.92,3014.1600000000003, you know there are you know and this is constant chatter between the unit and the marines are
3014.1600000000003,3018.6400000000003, shouting at each other and then you know as the grunts are the jungle thing they say well the
3018.64,3025.68, grunts are asleep so as your squad enters this the outskirts of this of this covenant base the
3025.68,3029.68, grunts that are on that are on watch out and everything I like leaned up against trees and they're
3029.68,3035.6, asleep so you can actually sneak in unlike smacking with your rifle button start taking out the
3035.6,3040.7999999999997, the sort of out-to-defenses like silently before you actually start the battle properly but then
3040.7999999999997,3044.8799999999997, there's a ton of these create the ton of covenant in there and you you work your way to this big
3044.96,3049.76, set piece at the end of this thing that they showed but it's the thing that they really showed
3049.76,3054.2400000000002, off to me they went from that which is with all the cool lighting so they showed the
3055.12,3059.12, what's it called sand trap sand traps yeah sand trap that's a new geoleroid
3059.12,3063.36, desert environment with these ruins under the sand and while you're playing the sand is getting
3063.36,3068.96, kicked up by the wind and like it's this huge environment and when you see the stuff using the
3069.36,3075.92, saved films video editor and you can freeze the action you actually you can freeze it mid effect
3076.4,3080.64, and you can see how subtle and cool some of the stuff is and why you why you really want to play
3080.64,3086.16, this in high def not a big screen because as these cool sort of like little trails of light
3086.16,3092.32, and the way that the explosions are and the way that everything is you know the laser bolts and plasma
3092.32,3097.44, flashes and everything they're like I mean it's it's beautiful and it's like so high definition
3097.44,3102.8, and so smooth and the effects and everything just add this extra layer to it and the funny thing is
3102.8,3108.96, like save like replays and safe films it's it's not a new concept right like people have done
3108.96,3114.7200000000003, replays and hockey games basketball games football games we just saw I just saw Tony Hawk's
3114.7200000000003,3120.88, proving ground today and they have a really awesome film editor in the game and you could put
3120.88,3126.0, together close ad effects on all this stuff it's nothing new but what I'm like why isn't the
3126.0,3131.28, Tony Hawk like taking snapshots or video of yourself skateboarding why isn't that as cool as a
3131.28,3137.6, handle thing is because you've never had replays of games where there's conflict you know like
3137.6,3142.88, people love a replay in that and where it's like oh check out this catch this one hand catch
3142.88,3148.56, and I land my foot my foot's inbound or look at this tackle but it in halo it's awesome watching like
3148.56,3152.64, okay here's this guy driving a warhog and he doesn't see the sky on the hill with a Spartan laser
3152.72,3157.3599999999997, aim bright at him and then he could stop it right at the moment where the Jeep explodes and your
3157.3599999999997,3162.7999999999997, body's flying and he can pan around at 360 degrees and look at it from any angle and you can see
3162.7999999999997,3167.3599999999997, all the action from another perspective and it's just it's playing multiplayer you don't you mean
3167.3599999999997,3172.3199999999997, obviously you only ever see your view of the fight and and the people that were fighting alongside you but
3172.3199999999997,3175.8399999999997, you don't know what's going on the other side of the map and in these things whether the ton of people
3175.8399999999997,3179.8399999999997, playing you could you could like okay well this was me and I'm gonna watch for how to me oh and
3179.84,3183.52, now I'm gonna go over here and you can see this this I mean particularly the comedy moments when
3183.52,3188.08, people and these like you know oh we didn't see that coming and like people setting traps and stuff
3188.08,3192.48, of people this pieces of the action that you'd never gonna be you would never aware of previously
3192.48,3197.04, that now you can just go and check it out and see how people handle it and it's like a moment of like
3197.04,3200.56, if you're playing in first person someone comes up behind you assassinates you you just get the
3200.56,3205.1200000000003, message and you just see your body slump over but out if you see a replay and you see your buddy
3205.12,3209.7599999999998, coming up behind you and then taking a hammer and smashing it you see how long he was behind you
3209.7599999999998,3213.7599999999998, yeah you didn't notice and it's the kind of thing where you're all sitting around watching and everyone's like
3213.7599999999998,3218.48, oh you know it's just it's a different you see what's happening here is these guys talk about it
3218.48,3222.56, it's like this is like the mark this is really cool thing like watch observationally is like the
3222.56,3228.64, more you guys talk about it the more your eyes light up and the more like into it you get like say a
3228.64,3233.44, lot of people like spending an awful lot of time watching these videos because I think the other
3233.44,3240.2400000000002, thing is you will be able to get better at Halo 3 by watching save games like by watching your own
3240.2400000000002,3245.04, save I mean it is the coach going back to the locker room and like watching the videos of the game
3245.04,3250.7200000000003, to find out what the other team was doing this I mean and it's built into the game and every single
3250.7200000000003,3256.88, game is saved you can choose to keep it or not keep it but the the full thing is it's saving
3256.88,3261.52, all of the data from every game they said if you're playing like a six hour death match it will
3261.6,3266.08, eventually choke because there's only so much that the hard drive can take but it's not saving video
3266.08,3271.92, it's saving data so the files are really tiny so this is why it can't spit video out to you know
3271.92,3276.8, a Microsoft YouTube kind of saying it's safe it's safe it's it has to be in the game engine
3276.8,3282.56, and the game engine will process it but every single game you play can be saved and then you can go
3282.56,3287.84, and you can go back and watch it and work out so you can like again again with you guys after I've
3287.92,3292.1600000000003, played it I didn't do very well I could sit and I can I can go and work out why you're better than me
3292.1600000000003,3297.52, because you know how you play a certain map and then I can go back afterwards and if if I notice that
3297.52,3302.56, you have certain habits and a map I'll be able to exploit that yeah so I'd say from the enthusiasm
3302.56,3306.4, it's not going out on a limb here to say you guys think that the excitement's warranted it's going to be
3306.96,3311.2000000000003, and we were talking about halib being intimidating is a multiplayer game and that they must be doing
3311.2000000000003,3315.84, this is one of the things that are doing to make it make it better for people that are in experience
3315.92,3319.84, it's not about the playing it's the after you play stuff that's going to help
3320.2400000000002,3324.6400000000003, there's obviously a lot of people here that are interested in like catching into the let's do
3324.6400000000003,3331.84, multiplayer and campaign based you know futuristic first person shooters we shoot got a chance to play
3331.84,3338.6400000000003, multiplayer where we did here today this afternoon fracture and I don't know that the whole deal
3338.6400000000003,3342.6400000000003, on that is there they're saying that they want to make that a big mainstream game right and
3342.72,3346.7999999999997, yours yeah John's got that look on his face that's not going to be a big mainstream game
3346.7999999999997,3352.4, why do you say that well for a start it looks very I mean I am admittedly I didn't see it as my
3352.4,3357.3599999999997, and in play I was watching you guys play it looks like a very derivative sort of a rena shooter
3357.3599999999997,3360.64, with environmental effect has a little stick yeah like you can you can make a lot of
3360.64,3364.64, destroy big chunks of the environment right someone went back and played magic carpet from 15
3364.64,3368.08, years ago I never the hell it was but hey that was going to cool what's drawing off red
3368.16,3373.44, faction right and right yeah like the spiritual successor to that geomod sort of
3373.44,3377.12, I mean it's pretty extreme I mean it's like cratizle like you can shoot things and what was
3377.12,3380.96, I think what you do when these heat pillows will come out of the ground it's a spider-nade you drop it
3380.96,3388.08, on a ground and it raises this tall skinny pillar of rock but it's really designed like
3388.08,3393.2799999999997, I kind of think of a way practical use that's for but they said what you do is you stand on it
3393.28,3398.7200000000003, because it glows before it does it so you know what it's stand and then it raises you up like
3398.7200000000003,3403.52, 20 30 feet into the air for a better you know if you want to snipe if you want to have a
3403.52,3409.76, better vantage point it struck me is a gorgeous tag them uh the it doesn't strike you know
3409.76,3414.1600000000003, sometimes you could tell this game's gonna do really well it was just like no I can't say anyone
3414.1600000000003,3419.6000000000004, got no one's gonna buy this guy well I was talking to Michael Dada who from egm about this and he goes
3420.48,3424.7999999999997, he wasn't that excited about multiplayer but he really likes the game because he said in a single
3424.7999999999997,3430.0, player and garnet you saw more of the single player that I did there's their puzzles there's ways
3430.0,3434.96, to try to figure out how like how am I gonna get into this base that's based around moving the earth you
3434.96,3440.0, know like you got to drop the land so you could get underneath the base wall or you get a raise
3440.0,3445.2799999999997, yourself up so you can reach another point so there's yet to think about it but in multiplayer my
3445.28,3450.2400000000002, problem with it was like like well I did see Michael do something cool like some guy was shooting
3450.2400000000002,3455.28, him and he was reloading so he dropped I forgot what the grenade is called whatever one that raises
3455.28,3460.32, the land he drops one in front of them and creates an instant wall to protect him from the incoming
3460.32,3464.7200000000003, shots and then he kind of hit behind it and let himself heal so that was kind of cool and what I was
3464.7200000000003,3470.6400000000003, trying to do was drop the other grenade that sinks the land to like if an enemy was close to me
3471.2799999999997,3476.8799999999997, because what happens in the game is it takes you longer to run uphill than it is to run downhill so
3476.8799999999997,3483.2, if you're on a higher ground higher elevation you have the tactical advantage but what happens if people
3483.2,3488.0, start throwing grenades and people are shooting it gets a little confusing I think because the
3488.0,3493.2799999999997, your your staves the battlefield you're on it's constantly changing and if you're in the middle
3493.2799999999997,3498.7999999999997, of like grenades doing opposite things like to your left wall the ground's going up until you're
3498.8,3501.92, right the ground's going down it's like I don't know where I am all of a sudden and then
3501.92,3506.2400000000002, so I'm throws in a vortex grenade that puts you in a little mini tornado it's just like
3506.2400000000002,3512.0, I'm like I don't know what's going on but to be fair I was talking to one of the president of
3512.0,3516.88, the developer and said you know he asked me what I found I'm like well I'm really confused I don't
3516.88,3521.1200000000003, know what's going on but part of that's like because of frame rates really bad right now and you
3521.1200000000003,3524.88, know they have another year to work on that so hopefully that will be smooth out of the year oh yeah
3524.88,3529.12, it's not yeah it's not gonna do it oh wow in that case maybe that will do that yeah all right
3529.12,3533.6, it's really early so like when the frame rates smooth out you'll you have a better idea what's
3533.6,3537.6800000000003, going on and then they need the little stuff that you're used to like the messaging like you
3537.6800000000003,3542.4, got killed by who so and so or you killed so and so like I couldn't tell if I was killing people
3542.4,3546.88, have the time like if they were you know the ground was raised and I don't see their out of sight
3546.88,3551.44, and I don't know if micrinate work or not but there are a lot of little indications and things
3551.52,3555.6, that they need to tweak yet yeah the thing with single player so far for me is that the back
3555.6,3559.6, story is pretty cool but the actual character that you're playing so far hasn't been fleshed
3559.6,3565.52, out nearly enough for like Lucas R2 portrays it has set all along hey we want to make this all
3565.52,3568.4, about the character and have great characters they haven't been pushing that with all of your
3568.4,3572.88, very much been pushing the tech which I think it comes off as a tech demo and number two and this
3572.88,3579.12, was the big hang up in red faction is that this sort of gameplay mechanic leads to too much
3579.7599999999998,3584.7999999999997, and often leads too much in the design where oh well look there's a metal plate oh I throw
3584.7999999999997,3589.52, the spire grenade underneath it and it pushes the metal plate up and that lets me get through oh look
3589.52,3593.7599999999998, there's a little bit of a hole I throw the grenade that makes the ground sink and I make the
3593.7599999999998,3598.56, ground sink and go through which is kind of cool when you're showing it but an entire game of it
3598.56,3604.0, derivative innovation yeah I mean like if you played red faction you knew that like there were
3604.0,3608.72, places that you just knew oh I'm supposed to break through my mind and then there was no apparent
3608.72,3614.3999999999996, of the path I went to what I'm supposed to do I need the rocket yes so you know if they can if they
3614.3999999999996,3620.64, can mature the game design and the level design as they have with the idea of like how much
3620.64,3624.64, trained affirmation they've done then they could be onto something and if they can couple that with
3624.64,3628.56, you know a really cool character that matches up with the kind of interesting backstory that they've
3628.56,3633.2, done then they're onto something yeah they may be they need to make you feel like you're smart
3633.2,3637.52, for figuring out what to do definitely definitely and not just oh look there's the metal plate
3637.52,3643.04, I wonder how I get around this whatever um so you know if they're gonna hit Massapiel I don't know
3643.92,3646.72, it's gonna be tough and it's gonna have to be less fiddly I mean it seemed like there were a lot of
3646.72,3649.92, controls to learn there and a lot of different stuff they might they might want to consider I hate
3649.92,3654.48, to say this because I hate them to take stuff out of it but they might want to consider simplifying
3654.48,3660.0, some of the overwhelming number of choices that you have there with like all the up and down inspire
3660.0,3664.8, and vortex I think that where I we're talking about this moment it deserves all right
3665.52,3669.44, I know what I mean all right I'll move right out of that one and when I know you're ready to talk about as much as we
3669.44,3674.7200000000003, want to which is burnout you came back glowing from playing that thing I play a lot of burnout over the
3674.7200000000003,3678.96, years and I'm gonna know a lot of people who said they have burnout burnout but John you were caught I
3679.52,3684.0, like burnout before you liked it yes really when burnout one like the crappy burnout
3684.0,3688.0, burnout when came into our office I claimed brought it by a judge like what's that terrible music
3688.0,3692.0800000000004, and I was like this game's really good yeah but they were never terrible though right never terrible
3692.4,3697.6, there was a music was terrible and the only ones the way that it would force you to
3697.6,3702.96, watch the crashes and everything and they weren't as visceral and and fun and then sort of burnout
3702.96,3706.96, by burnout burnout two was much better and then burnout three was a lot of the coming out party
3706.96,3712.16, and then burnout revenge was obviously great and Dominator did less than about that better this is
3713.12,3718.24, I mean he said I'll just you know just try it out and it's I mean it's all open world for
3718.24,3721.04, stuff so there's moves that you've not been able to do in burnout before like you have
3721.04,3725.6, hambright turns and everything and it's very exaggerated physics so it's just parking yeah you
3725.6,3730.7999999999997, you can just also just shit you can do that was so cool parallel you know it's like the guys like
3730.7999999999997,3733.8399999999997, it's playing is like if you if you're ready like you know what's the first thing you do when you
3733.8399999999997,3736.72, get a hambright turn you figure out you can do it and you see it done in the movies you're like
3736.72,3740.8799999999997, I want to see if I can parallel park so there's like a there's like a burnout award for
3740.8799999999997,3744.9599999999996, there's like parked cars now in the game and the law sometimes they'll be separated like with a space
3744.96,3748.48, where you can parallel park and into the space here and I turn it slide into it and it
3748.48,3753.2, grades you on how well you did on lining up into the space well blew me away it was the the
3753.2,3757.92, persistent world nature of it I mean as a multiplayer game there can only be eight people in the world
3757.92,3763.28, but it's 72 square kilometers which I I googled that it's 30 square miles
3765.04,3769.2, of roadway which is pretty pretty big close to as big a San Francisco right so it's it's a
3769.2,3772.32, huge city with a lot of and it's the main streets and all the back streets and one of the
3772.4,3778.6400000000003, things it does for the persistence is there are stats for every single stretch of road in the game
3778.6400000000003,3784.0800000000004, and based on your it tracks your buddy list and everyone that's played the game and reaching a
3784.0800000000004,3790.6400000000003, top speed or doing a crash or the various things that it requires you to do in a sandbox world
3791.2000000000003,3796.96, it's tracking so if you go down if you boost down a hill and you boost it down that hill faster than
3797.04,3802.8, anyone else has ever the the little tracker in the game will log the fact that you have the record
3802.8,3807.6, for that stretch of road and then everyone else in the game will then be judging their performance
3807.6,3812.2400000000002, in that in that part of the world against you and that that applies to absolutely everything
3812.2400000000002,3817.44, way well how does it work like if if you have the record and I go visit that road it's going to tell
3817.44,3821.6, it's so if if you if you may on each other's so it'll it'll it'll say it'll track who has the
3821.68,3826.16, record for that thing right and if we're on our friends list it'll make a big a deal of the fact
3826.16,3832.08, okay that you'll it'll be like your friend Jw HD has the record on this stretch of road and
3832.08,3836.88, it'll sort of go do you into trying to beat it which then kind of build on the next mechanic which
3836.88,3840.88, is that what happens when that starts to occur in the game that you guys are both in is if it's
3840.88,3846.08, your record and he's like beating it then you're going to go see where he is on the map and go
3846.08,3852.4, try and wreck him out right so I mean there's there's some crackdown persistence to it in the
3852.4,3856.96, it does these joinable games and you can you'd aid if you can be in the world at once and it
3856.96,3862.4, because it's all sandboxed there's no contrived events per se in the game you start your own
3862.4,3866.64, like races yeah you're making your own game so you pull it you pull up at the stop light
3866.64,3873.12, and you pull L2 and R2 and all the other cars at the stop light you are then racing against and
3873.12,3877.68, if one of the cars near that within the catchment area of that race challenge if one of them
3877.68,3882.4, happens to be one of you guys you can say if you want to join in the race or not so it's not like
3882.4,3888.08, test drive where where it was it was free but there was still an element of it being
3888.08,3891.2799999999997, contrived like you could challenge other players in the world but the races themselves were at
3891.2799999999997,3896.56, set locations you can start a race wherever there are other cars and it can be a one on one or
3896.56,3900.16, it can be an eight player race and you know there's the things you can do and then the crashes are
3900.16,3906.96, the same it's not it's not those sort of massively sort of orchestrated almost like you know
3906.96,3912.3999999999996, playing crazy golf with cars thing now you drive along and you see a bunch of cars you hit L1 and
3912.3999999999996,3916.96, R1 and it flips the car up in the air and then the challenge is to make the crash last for as long
3916.96,3920.0, as you close the can it's almost like a rhythm game element it's a rhythm game then because
3920.0,3924.8799999999997, as the car hits the ground if you hit X it will bounce the car back up into the air and then you
3924.8799999999997,3929.12, want to hit other cars and again if you're in the world and you see me doing a crash you can
3929.2,3932.88, come and give me a nudge to help me go keep going further along or we can join in the crash
3932.88,3937.44, and do it together and we're bouncing off each other and doing shit in the world so you can
3937.44,3941.7599999999998, there's these sort of collaborative like so I mean I would imagine that if you get eight
3941.7599999999998,3944.72, like minded people like we're going to do a crash and we're going to crash together and we're
3944.72,3948.96, going to see if we can crash from the top of this hill to the beach and like bouncing into each
3948.96,3952.24, other and trying to see the exit that synchronized crash right well he was saying that there
3952.24,3956.56, are elements of the crash game where whereas before it was like playing golf with cars now he said
3956.56,3962.32, it's a combination of catamari and math with cars that's a weird combination
3963.36,3967.36, I think I think you have to talk about other graphics because we've seen Burnout Revenge on
3967.36,3971.92, Xbox 360 which was like an Xbox game with a little better lighting you know and after coming
3971.92,3977.6, from that to this it looks so much better as someone shit oh this game's hot crash is there
3977.6,3982.88, is a car's or buckling and it's just a beautiful like it looks it looks really good I remember that demo
3983.04,3989.6800000000003, which was that a 360 press conference where they showed that car that grandma was by pseudo the
3989.6800000000003,3993.76, guys who went on right full auto yeah was pseudo that was right was when the original XNA demo before
3993.76,3998.56, Xbox 60 was ever even okay so you remember those demos the crashes real time in this game
3998.56,4003.52, look like that they do and that that killed me I was like whoa that's that's exactly like
4003.52,4007.12, we saw that press conference to keep the persistent well and the sandbox the night one of the
4007.12,4011.6800000000003, things that they've changed fairly dramatically from so crashes it back traffic checking is back
4012.0,4015.04, like a lot of the stuff that would take an hour for dominated a back put in a different way
4015.04,4020.7999999999997, in this but what the interesting thing is that if you hit something head on previously that was
4020.7999999999997,4025.6, it there was a crash and the crash animation it would reset the car in this if you crash into
4025.6,4029.8399999999997, some it there was one of the crashes and again it's all you know based on how you hit the things
4029.8399999999997,4034.0, were crumple I was in the stallion which is like the Mustang kind of car and there was this like
4034.0,4039.7599999999998, shitty old van coming around a corner I hit it so hard that my car just tore through the thing and it
4039.84,4045.5200000000004, like just bust open this van completely if fuck my car up completely but there's a rule in
4045.5200000000004,4051.76, burnout that if you if you crash in a way that you still have four wheels you can drive away from it
4051.76,4057.28, so I basically drove through this van came out there was this spectacular animation where
4057.28,4061.92, I was like shit going everywhere my car's getting all crumpled up and it sort of bounced
4061.92,4067.6800000000003, out of the back of this van and it's like in pieces behind me and then I jabbed on the accelerator
4067.68,4073.04, and I wheel spanned and started driving again it was just like so much more satisfying than another really
4073.04,4077.2799999999997, cool satisfying thing is we've been playing multiplayer and you crash into somebody if you have
4077.2799999999997,4082.0, the a PlayStation eye camera or presumably the Xbox camera wherever that's called like it snaps a
4082.0,4086.8799999999997, picture of them look look on their face when they get killed so they were showing it that's why
4086.8799999999997,4090.56, they were showing it on ps3 is they had the ps3 camera there and that was so cool because they were
4090.56,4095.44, playing it with someone back at redwood shores and like I wasn't when they were over you'd wreck
4095.52,4098.4, it was like they talked so I talked about that and they're like well you know when we originally
4098.4,4103.68, did this we had it set to where it snapped that picture a half second after the take down
4103.68,4107.36, it's like what we changed it now to where it takes it about two and a half seconds afterwards because
4107.36,4112.16, what we found was like when people get taken down they started to want to pose for the picture
4112.16,4117.2, and that's exactly what happened is you got like we're we like take down the dude in redwood shores
4117.2,4120.4800000000005, and he was like playing one of the ease lounges and he would like have these looks on his face like
4121.44,4125.5199999999995, that was really funny you're like you know like holding his head or like holding his hands up or whatever
4125.5199999999995,4130.4, even he humanizes it it's gonna be like you'll be able to save those pictures and you'll be able to
4130.719999999999,4136.799999999999, drop them into your friends list and send them to your friend over ps network like that
4136.799999999999,4142.5599999999995, so you're able to is the 360 version here I didn't see it no it's not it was just only on one
4142.5599999999995,4149.36, pod at Baca hang out yeah and that's it yeah it was a line it was on two pods at the press conference and
4149.44,4154.24, that's all they've got wow I mean it's pretty downplayed it makes it very awesome it is yeah
4154.24,4158.799999999999, and it is really awesome but I guess there wasn't so much waiting for the other racing game that was
4158.799999999999,4165.28, here to play that was on 360 I was PGR4 it's it's fine it's very competent I just I don't know there was
4166.5599999999995,4170.48, you said you were bored with it was I like I gave you that lead in because you told me you were bored
4170.48,4176.32, it was it was just I mean it's got bikes now it's cool I mean but you know test drive did that and
4176.4,4180.96, but it's a pretty a version of I mean I was I when I was watching it the press conference I just thought
4180.96,4186.88, they shouldn't call it it's PGR wet basically because you know there's a lot of nice rain effects and
4186.88,4192.0, it snows as well it's not just rain and if you'd seen all the videos and screenshots you would think
4192.0,4199.36, that in PGR it's raining all the time it's not but it's snowing sometimes and it's dry sometimes
4199.36,4203.679999999999, and it's nine day and it's in a little more caution it's quite competent I mean the thing that
4203.76,4207.76, things that they have done that are more interesting is the career mode now is a proper career mode
4207.76,4213.76, and it's based it's more character driven than it's about you as the driver not as you as your
4213.76,4219.04, car collection it's not car it's not just chasing points like previously you were chasing kudos
4219.04,4226.400000000001, points or you were chasing race points and that was it now you are specifically racing again 72 other
4227.12,4232.0, like racers in the world and you are trying to work you way up the rankings against these other
4232.0,4234.96, characters that weren't probably the biggest change that made to the structure of the game
4234.96,4239.84, what could a what could PGR do then to get you excited I mean what could it do I mean it's
4239.84,4244.96, could be an out and it's yeah is how excited me right now because we're not done playing for
4244.96,4250.72, the yet that it's it's a GT5 for a log right come around the same time which which apparently
4250.72,4255.36, looks unbelievable and HD I mean everyone's like no don't even watch don't watch it in in the game trailers
4255.36,4260.08, window wait so you can watch it and proper HD yeah all right so PGR for what which
4260.16,4263.12, your projection on how that's going to do this for what do you think it's going to be like you think
4263.12,4267.84, are you are thinking to find something to make you interested maybe I mean right now I mean it's
4267.84,4273.44, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it looks way better than the last PGR but I mean it's another
4273.44,4279.84, fucking racing game on 360 yeah and it and it and it really it must just like PGR 3 it is really
4279.84,4284.88, struggling with am I a serious racing game or am I an arcade racing game I'm both and I'm neither
4284.88,4288.48, me it seemed like the need was a little more towards our kid this time little more yeah and the
4288.5599999999995,4292.959999999999, bikes kind of help that you know the the way they're doing completely on the bikes is kind of
4292.959999999999,4296.799999999999, interesting and the way that it leans and but it seems like there be some kudo balance issues
4296.799999999999,4299.599999999999, there because what they demonstrate when they demoed it and they showed how much quite good
4299.599999999999,4303.2, rack up the kudos on the motorcycle so I thought to myself wow it's going to make a real
4303.2,4306.959999999999, imbalance well the way they're balancing it is I mean you get kudos by doing wheelies and endos
4306.959999999999,4312.32, and stuff but when you're doing those it's impossible to control so okay I mean the kudo system
4312.32,4316.5599999999995, has always been a big point of contention over that game anyway yeah I mean you're you're you're
4316.88,4322.240000000001, facial expression it's how a lot of people respond to it yeah I mean I have always struggled to be
4322.240000000001,4328.400000000001, really enthusiastic about it I mean I can appreciate it but it's not you know forces force
4328.400000000001,4332.88, us doing a very good job on the realistic and burnout is going all the way into arcade stuff and then
4332.88,4336.64, the next big sim game as Shane said that everyone's gonna want to play is gonna be GD5
4338.160000000001,4342.240000000001, alright that's fair enough I wanted to change gears completely for a second because I was down
4342.240000000001,4346.240000000001, at Capcom today and had to actually chance to check out the zapper remember we're talking the other
4346.24,4350.48, day about the zapper yesterday and yeah I like the zapper I think it's it's good I
4350.48,4354.48, wish it had more rumble and I think you agree right oh you don't even really feel the rumble dude
4354.48,4358.16, I mean it's very faint I was saying it was I feel like much say he'd buying all these batteries to
4358.16,4363.28, power my various Wii peripherals like I almost wish they'd put like an optional like rumble thing
4363.28,4367.76, in it for the battery to make it shake so I played on Brella Chronicles as as you did Shane and the
4367.76,4370.8, first thing I did since we talked about it we didn't know the answer was like I stopped and like
4370.8,4375.28, checked out the the zapper itself and the people at Capcom are really cool I mean like explore it and
4375.44,4379.92, like this thing is actually really cool it feels good it's made out of the same plastic material as the
4379.92,4384.96, as the Wii mode so it has that nice you know heavy good weighty solid feel to it the front handle
4385.599999999999,4391.44, where the Wii mode fits into has a little cord guide and then the that goes down into the handle
4391.44,4398.08, and curls up under the the heel of your palm and where the nunchuck part fits so it's all very it's
4398.08,4401.84, all very it's concealed very tightly with the clothe it's the only thing like in the
4401.84,4406.0, cobblestone together out of rubber bands or something you know could cobbl one together
4406.0,4411.12, out of the bands and sticks could make what in which shop you wouldn't come up with anything
4411.12,4415.84, to work as well as I mean it works it's it's really nice you could you could come up with anything
4415.84,4422.8, that works as well as this yeah you wouldn't it has a trigger it has a trigger how does that
4422.8,4428.16, actually how does that work that is that a mechanical thing that presses the Z button for you I believe
4428.16,4433.2, so yeah yeah I think it is the the people the what the thing on the back of the way is
4433.2,4438.08, you know it's on the nunchuck right yeah yeah well you know my point was that most people
4438.08,4443.36, probably couldn't craft something better for the business I suppose someone who was like really
4443.36,4450.24, good for a 20 to 20 bucks for a basic bend plastic is oh seems a little a little much
4450.88,4454.24, all right but the idea of it's very cool and you do feel you do feel like a bat I mean let me tell you
4454.24,4457.28, what playing umbrella chronicles with this thing you do feel like a badass because it's like
4457.28,4461.84, you're holding this you know Mac 10 submachine and sort of deal and you're blasting on the zombies
4461.84,4464.5599999999995, that part was really cool but I have to agree kind of a shame that right now I think the
4464.5599999999995,4472.8, sensitivity needs some work because the it's very hard to get the cross here to stable move across
4472.8,4477.44, the screen it jumps around specifically what the hell is that please quiet yourself before
4477.44,4481.04, taking a podcast got it well and I complain that like the headshots they're kind of hard to do
4481.04,4484.4, it's a real skill shot and you really want to do it because it's a difference of hitting a zombie
4484.4,4489.28, like eight it done ten times versus one hit yeah well it's all about headshots it is very much
4489.28,4492.24, about headshots and there's lots of stuff that you need to pick up in that game so it's very you
4492.24,4497.04, need to be able to place the cursor accurately and right now that part's not there but so I
4497.04,4502.08, like chronicles is um how's the dead basically right it's but it's a little more than that and with
4502.08,4506.48, with the analog note no where it is now it kind of feels like an FPS because you are looking around
4507.44,4513.36, I wouldn't go so far so it feels like an FPS so it's not entirely pretty it's not entirely on rails
4513.44,4518.719999999999, there is an element of it's entirely on rails how it is you just have a it's a broader
4518.719999999999,4522.4, field of vision than what it's rendering for you right so like with the analog stick you can
4522.4,4525.5199999999995, you can look to the left look to the right would you actually need to do quite a lot because
4525.5199999999995,4529.28, there's stuff in the environment where you need to like blast boxes to get ammo out of it and pick
4529.28,4534.48, up a you know extra I know pretty common common deal there is still a arcade light gun game it's
4534.48,4538.48, you know it's a slightly evolved but arcade light guns are fun did you know I mean I've had a lot
4538.5599999999995,4543.04, of fun playing arcade light gun game I watched the video in Nintendo I saw that chick jumping around
4543.04,4548.08, feeling like looking like she was having a really good time so I'm sold I thought it was pretty fun
4548.08,4552.879999999999, but it's stuff like that like a game sir they're all fun on some level but you need to pay
4552.879999999999,4557.28, 50 dollars for like a game well I think if you're gonna put a disaster you pay another 20
4557.28,4560.48, well I think are you will have hopefully enough content to make it worth its while I'm
4560.48,4564.959999999999, be a long experience and more worried about like time crisis 4 on ps3 and ghost squad
4565.04,4569.44, ghost squad like more like things you put 50 cents in and walk away yeah it's like the Saturn days
4569.44,4574.16, like all these like ungames that you're like you're you know when virtual cop first came out where
4574.16,4579.68, excited about it but then it's like 10 minutes later like oh yeah well I hopefully will be some
4579.68,4584.24, more games to take advantage with the zapper right maybe well yeah I think for for FPS is that's
4584.24,4588.88, the whole idea is like they wanted to like evolve FPS on we so like I think for a real first person
4588.88,4593.2, shooter like metal of honor they showed a brief video that like if you use the zapper there I think
4593.2,4597.12, that could work because no one like metal of honor using the weak controls there's still the
4597.12,4601.44, problem though of centering like like and you talk to the big deal right now right of how to
4601.44,4606.72, center how to resenge yourself in an FPS yeah well and so before we get out of here let's
4606.72,4611.599999999999, wrap this show up with the what some people are calling potentially maybe even the game of the show
4611.599999999999,4615.599999999999, which you got a little chance because he's a judge to play some today I've seen the extra trailer
4615.599999999999,4618.72, of it and have been gush and over the show and talked about it yesterday and the show is right it's
4618.72,4623.280000000001, got to be Call of Duty 4 so should you play it on a shooters what do you think of what do you
4623.280000000001,4630.96, think of Call of Duty 4 I was excited but I mean what I play today was essentially Call of Duty in
4630.96,4636.240000000001, a modern era you know it's like very action packed there's a shit going on all around you
4636.240000000001,4644.72, explosions it's just intense high adrenaline like very fast-paced action so it was like you know
4644.72,4649.76, why all they did was slap on modern clothing on people give me a modern machine with laser
4649.76,4655.68, sites what I did like you know like there's one part I'm running through this burnt out apartment
4655.68,4660.88, complex and the lights are all out so you have these night vision but if you have your laser
4660.88,4667.360000000001, pointers on you can see where your guns your guns are pointing and all your teammates and where
4667.360000000001,4671.6, their guns are pointing so if you're kind of like in the chaos of war you're not sure where the
4671.6,4676.96, enemies are you just see all these lasers in the darkness just all pointing like to the second floor
4676.96,4680.320000000001, of the building next door so you like you've started to look over there and you're like oh yeah there's
4680.320000000001,4685.76, a bunch of enemies over there so there's like exciting moments like that I'm not sure if this was
4685.76,4689.92, done in a previous Call of Duty because you'd throw grenades back was I done before I guess yes
4689.92,4693.6, soon you throw it in the middle of the door okay so I know they did in metal bottom I wasn't
4693.6,4700.88, sure about COD but and then the one part that was really awesome I had to take out these tanks that
4700.96,4706.0, were driving on a highway overhead highway and you could just barely see them and then you get
4706.0,4710.8, you picked up this weapon I forgot what is called but you could take it in any tank rocket yeah
4710.8,4715.92, it's an anti tank rocket and so the cursor comes up and then you're locked onto the tank and you
4715.92,4722.24, pull the trigger and then I shot it and then I look like I put the rocket launcher down and I'm like
4722.24,4727.52, oh nothing happened and the second later the tank just exploded I'm like oh that was weird what
4727.52,4731.76, happened is like I thought maybe the game wasn't complete yet so then I took out the second tank
4731.76,4736.64, and the producer who was watching me play it's like oh this is what's happening so what happens is
4736.64,4741.200000000001, you lock onto the tank you fire this rocket it's like almost like a fire and forget weapon
4741.200000000001,4745.6, it shoots straight up into the air like hundreds of feet in the air it's like watching a flare
4745.6,4751.4400000000005, go up into the sky and then it arcs it just shoots straight up and then it does a 180
4751.4400000000005,4757.040000000001, arc straight down and it just slams into the tank and it explodes and it's like wow this is awesome
4757.04,4761.68, this is like I'm using modern modern day equipment you know this is what are your so you
4761.68,4766.64, like world war two yeah yeah and it's like I have machine guns with laser sights so it's not like
4766.64,4772.88, these those old carbines and stuff you know that they use in more war two so it's very exciting
4772.88,4776.88, and action packed and what I didn't get to play is what they showed in the trailer and they're
4776.88,4781.92, like press conference so that I'm excited about too because then it's a more stealthy side to it
4782.8,4789.2, but storyline wise it's it's a really cool idea it's about this this Russian general who
4789.2,4794.4, like old school guy wants to bring back the glory of mother Russia it's getting all the support from
4795.2,4802.0, X KGB guys X Army guys and he's gonna take over Russia and then but what they do to kind of
4802.0,4806.8, distract the Americans they know the Americans love a good war they start so I'm shit in the Middle
4807.360000000001,4811.92, so you're gonna fight two campaigns you're gonna be part of the American campaign in the Middle
4811.92,4818.16, East trying to and you know as the American you don't know that this is all the this Russian guys fall
4818.16,4823.360000000001, and then you're also gonna be play British SIS soldier in the Russian campaign and then when I
4823.360000000001,4828.64, asked him like well these two the battles kind of the story lines kind of converge and he's like
4829.4400000000005,4834.16, just gave a big spasm I was like yep that's a good call and then so they have really ambitious plans
4834.16,4838.32, for like this these two different skirmishes happening different parts of the world kind of
4838.32,4843.68, converging into an almost global battle so who there's an assault on the U.S. homeland that'd be also
4844.72,4848.24, that's they who knows that might be the expansion of our own do to I think this game sounds so
4848.24,4851.599999999999, tight what's interesting to me is after all that these guys have been busted their haunts for a
4851.599999999999,4855.5199999999995, couple years on their game engine it doesn't sound like the graphics really overwhelmed you that
4855.5199999999995,4860.32, much compared to their other efforts I that's so much they're they're fine you know I mean but in
4860.32,4865.28, that trailer the part that they excited everybody was you're you're looking in this grassy field
4865.28,4869.84, and you don't even notice that by your partner who's completely in camouflage and has all the
4869.84,4875.92, brush and branches and crap on him he gets up out of the ground and like you can hear the audience
4875.92,4880.5599999999995, go kind of woo because no one noticed that guy standing right there has talked about to a guy
4880.5599999999995,4885.44, from active vision he said the developers have changed where that soldier was a couple of times
4885.44,4890.0, because they didn't quite like it and he's had trouble spotting him every time you like even
4890.0,4895.2, when you go into it looking for your camouflage partner you can't find him and it's real you know
4895.2,4899.759999999999, it's not some fake video game graphical trick it's he's really there you just can't see
4899.759999999999,4904.5599999999995, blends in so well you can't see it and what I like about what was shown in a trailer is you know
4904.5599999999995,4908.5599999999995, usually when you're playing your ghostry cons or rainbow six is you're the guy leading and
4908.5599999999995,4912.799999999999, you're the one commanding the other guys but I don't remember another game where I'm following
4912.8,4917.68, another guy and he's commanding me you know so you're watching he has his hand signals and he's like
4917.68,4922.16, hey don't shoot that guy just yeah or take him out or he's calling out targets to you so it seems like
4922.16,4928.0, that your companion a is really smart so I'm really excited to play that part of the game to that
4928.0,4934.400000000001, the nine traditional COD like more stealthy stuff so you play Call of Duty 2 yeah that
4934.400000000001,4938.64, I didn't play 3 but I did play 2 because he played Call of Duty 2 same developer Call of Duty 4
4938.72,4946.240000000001, just kind of wrap it up with how do you think the switch from you know the very old style weaponry
4946.240000000001,4949.76, of World War II where you know you didn't have rocket launchers and long range for
4949.76,4953.280000000001, guy and forget weapons and I can't stop yeah how much do we're able still have that visceral
4953.280000000001,4957.4400000000005, field I mean when you have the rifle in your hand it still have that COD 2 field oh yeah yeah
4957.4400000000005,4960.8, you're looking down to barrel you know you pull in left trigger you're looking down to barrel
4960.8,4966.72, but now you had this high this huge caliber high-powered machine gun right and it just feels awesome
4966.8,4971.360000000001, and the demo in my demo they didn't really spark because they cranked it up they had 5 points
4971.360000000001,4977.280000000001, around they turned it up loud and I'm like Jesus you guys like your audio but it was like rumbling
4977.280000000001,4981.52, everywhere you could hear the machine gun both like boom boom boom boom and you could hear the
4981.52,4986.72, echoes of the gun fire happening all around you and it's just awesome having like that full
4987.6,4993.280000000001, modern weaponry you know like I had a grenade launcher underneath my machine gun like I said the
4993.36,4998.639999999999, laser sights and all that stuff so yeah it was just it's a different feeling and it's great to
4998.639999999999,5004.88, because you know all the other games that were playing with modern weapons you know your ghost
5004.88,5008.719999999999, recounts and rainbow sticks you're not really unloading you know you're not like I'm just going to
5008.719999999999,5012.88, go full auto and just go nuts you got to be a little bit more careful and tactical but in this
5012.88,5018.32, game it's just like you know what just go nuts just like just go crazy that's that black thing
5019.04,5024.4, that's that black thing but it's got better than black it's not the black all right so good enough
5024.4,5030.08, to be game of the show contender for me I don't know for me I still like Mass Effect all right
5030.08,5034.639999999999, I was really in press with Mass Effect but we got plenty more to come back and visit tomorrow
5034.639999999999,5038.96, we'll definitely get this PC guys in as well because we were gonna talk about crisis and I saw a couple
5038.96,5043.36, other PC games I know Jeff Green actually blogged the other day about a just today about how PC
5043.36,5047.5199999999995, games are good to so we'll get that Shane's got some more stuff he's seen shoot thanks for hanging
5047.52,5052.8, out with us dude thanks for having me I appreciate it don't get any trouble between now and tomorrow
5052.8,5058.8, when we come back tomorrow we'll have the final show from here in Santa Monica until then we are ghost
