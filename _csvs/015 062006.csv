0.0,16.0," Hello and welcome once again to the CGW radio podcast. This is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of computer gaming world magazine and I have three CGW editors with me today and they include the following."
16.0,26.0, Sean Elliott. Darren Gladstone. Sean Maloy. And kids were it's a little scary here today because we are flying without a net. There's no.
26.0,34.0, The guys who have produced our podcasts in the past are not in the room. Instead taking the soundboard is our own Sean Maloy over there.
34.0,38.0," Yep. I can go to the Sean. It's a little nervous, a little nervous. A little bit."
38.0,42.0, I will carry it. There's some light. And we're also flying without a Ryan Scott today. Oh and no Ryan Scott.
42.0,45.0, Yeah. Right. So should we bring up to we get it out of the way? Okay.
45.0,50.0, We bring up Guild Wars. There's actually a lot of spec and I just hit level 20. I mean for the 30th time.
50.0,54.0, Yeah. Think you hear that and they have two million subscribers now.
54.0,62.0, How's that? Okay. So it's as if he was here. So Ryan good luck on the Rookanel. See you next week.
62.0,66.0, Oh yeah. We should make fun of Ryan. He's getting yet another route canal. Yeah.
66.0,72.0, This one's been rough. I heard that sucks. Ouch. Yeah. I think the lesson to all you out there is brush your teeth.
72.0,77.0," In fact, it's a floss. Plossless 20. Pepsident. It's going to help. Yeah."
77.0,84.0," If you're listening to this, if you're listening now and you haven't flossed in the last 24 hours go ahead and get a piece of floss up right now."
84.0,91.0," Why you listen on the bus doesn't matter. That's what I'm saying. Sean, are you nervous? Are you okay over there?"
91.0,97.0, I think I'm fine. All right. I can handle this. All right. He's got a little bit of a deer in the headlight. Sort of look.
97.0,103.0," Well, I'm watching all of these lights flashing. So pretty scary. Yep. Not like. Oh, so it's kind of like I want to go to color organs from the set."
103.0,114.0, Put on some pink Floyd for you over there. Okay. So we've had a bit of a not weak because Sean and and Sean and Elliot. That's great.
114.0,122.0, Sean Elliott and Darren were were at a town. I was actually at a town this weekend. So does that mean we've been playing any games?
122.0,128.0, A lot of golden tea golf golden tea golf. The game for all vacationers. Yes.
128.0,134.0," I guess joking. Yeah. I was playing a besides good brother. See my sister get married. Congratulations, Kerry."
134.0,146.0," Yeah. I also was playing a tight and quest. I played like the first level of that. Yeah. I'm kind of like, I mean, I'm still like, I basically got to Sparta. Is that how far you got? Yeah."
147.0,153.0," I don't know. I got one of those, you know, you know, your mom says if you got nothing nice to say sort of things going on."
153.0,158.0," But it's early yet. It's early yet. Yeah. One day I kept thinking as I mean, the game looks pretty. Looks very pretty."
158.0,161.0, And it's he and I guess what I'm playing it. I'm thinking.
161.0,173.0," Age of what age of empires did to, you know, warcraft. This is kind of what Titan Quest is doing to like, the obliques. Okay. So it's kind of right now. All I was seeing is just way too much Diablo."
174.0,180.0," You know, it was like a scene for Diablo. You know, I mean, you had 3D."
180.0,191.0," The one thing I think it could be a strong selling point could be the map the map making tool. I haven't played around yet, but I mean, does it do random dungeons or is it?"
191.0,195.0," Gosh, I haven't even played enough to know there. My opinion. I don't think so. Yeah."
195.0,202.0," That's one of the only things that you know, to criticize Diablo. The only things I didn't like about it is the randomness because there's really no it's not they're not ran."
202.0,207.0," Wow, you didn't like in this or from our not random from the last preview I edited."
207.0,211.0," So I said, okay, but it's no."
211.0,224.0," Because on how can you didn't like the randomness? I like level design. I like when people can intentionally put a room in a spot and like it, you know, has it's there for reason because this is where they want to ramp up the challenge."
224.0,229.0," I mean, I understand that Diablo is all about it. I love Diablo. I just that was the only thing."
229.0,234.0," Right. Oh, I wish they had actually, you know, designed a few of these levels instead of just kind of have, you know, the algorithm and make them."
234.0,238.0, And the algorithm was really good at making them. Right. But I'm going to be real downscadding.
238.0,249.0," I read about Helgate, you know, just because it's just in the most general way in that like in my experience, the randomly generated content is usually boring content, you know, it's not it doesn't have the polish of design words."
249.0,261.0," It's constructed very carefully and deliberately to create, you know, different paths of, you know, progress and action and this and that and I think the last experience I had with the randomly generated content was horrible."
261.0,266.0, And that was that PSP game which was the one it was like champions and aura.
266.0,269.0," No, it was the one where you're inside. It was supposed to as a Konami first person."
269.0,276.0," Oh, you're putting on coated arms. Yeah. And it was just like, I mean, basically hello dead ends and back and forth."
276.0,282.0, I would think a shooter wouldn't wouldn't play itself out as well though as a deablo style game.
282.0,289.0," Right. Well, I understand some of the concerns and I think Helgate actually, I mean, like obviously it's not out yet. It has a lot of time before it's ready."
289.0,296.0," But I think there's some, like they are looking to address those problems and when I was, you know, doing the cover story a couple months back, they were saying how,"
296.0,301.0," when they were, when they're putting the game together, they're actually creating algorithms that are actually,"
301.0,306.0," you know, putting a lot of elements together inside the inside each room in each environment, you're playing in it."
306.0,310.0," Like it's like, like, haphazardly, you know, slapped together, it makes some kind of sense."
310.0,317.0," Right. I guess in Diablo, I mean, the agarith of Smasa bin such that, you know, certain things had to happen, right?"
317.0,324.0," I mean, obviously, like the butcher is put there, you know, like you know, no matter what on level three, the boss is going to be there."
324.0,327.0, Right. That's just kind of constructs a maze a little differently around getting there.
327.0,331.0," I think in terms of the visual experience, expectations were a lot lower than two."
331.0,335.0," Yeah. Yeah. I was like, if you see that same, I don't know, what would it be in Titan Quest?"
335.0,339.0, You see that same scorpion cave a thousand times in a row.
339.0,341.0, Right. I don't know. Maybe not.
341.0,343.0," Well, I'm definitely willing to give it another question."
343.0,345.0," Well, it has been a scorpion. It's been mostly say to so far."
345.0,346.0, Yeah. Nice.
346.0,350.0, Yeah. I still want to play more of it. I'm not ready to judge it yet.
350.0,355.0," I just was expecting something a little different than Diablo and it plays for, I mean,"
355.0,363.0," as you go through the tutorial mission, you know, everything that they show you, you know, the one of the towns people, you know, and here's the place where you'll resurrect."
363.0,367.0," Everything was like, oh, yeah, that's a Diablo feature. Oh, yeah, that's a Diablo feature."
367.0,369.0," Oh, there's the town portal. Exactly."
369.0,371.0, Yeah. I don't know.
371.0,379.0," Yeah. Well, there was one thing kind of bummed me out. I mean, maybe it'll be addressed later on, but you pick that one kind of direction your character class is going to go."
379.0,383.0," Or rather, I should say the skill sets you're going to choose, and you can't go back."
383.0,387.0," Yeah, the decision. It's all over. And you just kind of go, it seems like you just go forward from there."
387.0,391.0, So which Diablo cones have kind of like out Diablo Diablo?
391.0,394.0, I can't remember. I say none.
394.0,395.0, Yeah. I'll probably pop into my money.
395.0,400.0," Well, I remember actually before this, I was actually like looking back over a couple older games I remember playing."
400.0,403.0," Like, you remember, you remember, remember, knocks?"
403.0,407.0, Yep. I thought that was pretty good. That was pretty good Diablo clone did a decent job.
407.0,411.0," But see, that's all you can ever say. That was like, it's a decent Diablo clone."
411.0,415.0," There's never one that made you say, okay, this is better."
415.0,418.0," Yeah. You know, like we most of us still have Diablo on our heart."
418.0,421.0, That's pretty interesting for a gaming genre.
421.0,424.0," You know, well, it seems like everything else."
424.0,427.0," It's like, you know, it's something's going to trump it in five years."
427.0,431.0," And it has or at least there's like, at least there's a debate to be had about something."
431.0,440.0," If you're saying, hey, what's, you know, it's not like there's just one shooter that's the only one that people will say is the big granddaddy and still by far the best."
440.0,443.0," Right. I mean, in real time strategies."
443.0,446.0," Yeah. I mean, Blizzard almost did it, but not quite, right?"
446.0,451.0," I mean, because you could argue that Starcraft kind of supplanted warcraft."
451.0,457.0," Hmm. But there's plenty of people who would take age of empire, so over Starcraft or Rise of Legends now."
457.0,460.0," I mean, there's all sorts of the Commander Conquer series."
460.0,465.0," And they've all definitely done something to, you know, to it and changed it and so on."
465.0,469.0," Yeah. Well, it's an interesting genre because it, you could argue that it's more complicated."
469.0,474.0," It gets if you start adding these layers and something you're going away for what makes it, you know, the opposite."
474.0,478.0," Right. It whereas like an RTS, you kind of want these extra strategic layers."
478.0,480.0," Yeah, I was just killing and shopping."
480.0,483.0," Yeah. And there's not, there's not even that much interface streamlining to be done."
483.0,488.0," Whereas like an RTS is there was, you know, since Starcraft has been a lot of changes just in how interfaces were."
488.0,491.0," I mean, it was just perfect."
491.0,498.0," I almost feel like, in order to make a game that's going to supplant a Diablo instead of trying to focus on, like, basically doing the same thing."
498.0,501.0, And I did a little better. Just try to take it in a different offshoot direction.
501.0,505.0, Make it more like action based. What about guild wars? Isn't guild wars?
505.0,508.0," Well, guild wars is kind of kind of is kind of is."
508.0,510.0, Right. And would not do that.
510.0,511.0, Ryan Woods hit him back here.
511.0,513.0," Oh, from a million people could."
513.0,515.0, The new great success.
515.0,516.0," Oh, who?"
516.0,518.0, He doesn't even need to be here.
518.0,520.0, We're actually doing all the talking for us.
520.0,525.0," Speaking of, I've played a few mods when I got back in while the levels were not randomly generated."
525.0,531.0," In some cases, they might as well have been one of them is Troy divine playground image."
531.0,532.0," Oh, for that."
532.0,539.0," And it's a university project. And I felt bad as like when I first came out, you know, the beta first came out quite a few servers up."
539.0,543.0, And then now when I went on to play there are two servers. One was occupied.
543.0,549.0," And then unfortunate thing for this game. I mean, again, the recap is, well, it's basically, you know,"
550.0,557.0," Trojans versus Greeks. And it's a cool idea that you have a bunch of AI controlled bots on your side and you're able as you as you're the one you're controlling dies,"
557.0,559.0, or able to take over the other ones.
559.0,564.0," But they're all brain dead, which is a big problem, but they're able to aim really well."
564.0,570.0," So it's like you'll see a guy standing in a corner somewhere, but spear sniping you across the entire map through wall."
570.0,571.0," Oh, yes."
571.0,576.0," And then other few, I'm getting to the real messed up part of the game, but other funny things are that you have this growl."
576.0,580.0, It's like this godly growl and it's supposed to whip up the enemy into fear and submission.
580.0,583.0, But basically what happens is they do this little dance like they have to go pee.
583.0,586.0, So you run up through a whole mob of the enemy defenses.
586.0,591.0," They run and the growl is more like a constipated like groaning, you know."
591.0,597.0," And so you run through them and you're like, and then all of a sudden, their whole army is just standing."
597.0,598.0, Just dancing.
598.0,599.0, I'm being afraid.
599.0,600.0, That's kind of cool.
600.0,602.0, We hear at a darren's office once a day.
603.0,604.0, Yeah.
604.0,611.0, The messed up thing in terms of the level design is that you really appreciate about the published games is that you're not participating in the beta process.
611.0,616.0," And that basically with the pods, you're doing it, but you realize just what work it really is."
616.0,623.0," Because I mean, I think in the first, you know, the first day of playing it, we found all these ways to exploit it where you're supposed to get over this castle wall and you have these ladders."
623.0,629.0," So within minutes, we're like, okay, let's wait for our teammates to get up the ladder and just pull the ladder out from under him and laugh at him."
629.0,630.0, And we kept doing that.
630.0,639.0," And then after that, take climb the wall, take the ladder myself and then go and run and get it and climb up buildings that they clearly hadn't intended me for you to climb right."
639.0,642.0, Take the ladder back up there with me and then just drop bombs on everyone.
642.0,644.0, That's how you game it well being untouchable.
644.0,649.0, But doesn't like if you knew respect for games where where the exploits are all gone.
649.0,650.0," Yeah, no, they're readable."
650.0,655.0," It's like, yeah, I mean, it's like for us editing like in its cycle, PDF series or something, you know, right."
655.0,656.0, I mean single handedly.
657.0,660.0," And then another cool model is playing, well, a cool model is playing."
660.0,662.0, It was a zombie strike.
662.0,664.0," It's a, yeah, it's a counter strike."
664.0,665.0, It's really simple.
665.0,666.0, There are two iterations of it.
666.0,673.0," One is basically you and, you know, your friends, your actual players face off waves of zombies blast them."
673.0,678.0," Then another version once you're, you know, it's competitive and once you're killed by a zombie, you become one then."
678.0,679.0, But pretty fun.
679.0,682.0," Nice, you know, simple, simple diversion from the usual counter strike."
682.0,686.0," And the down point on that, the on the versus mode is that the maps again weren't designed for it."
686.0,691.0, So the exploits now are that everyone with the guns goes and find some ledge to camp.
691.0,693.0, And you'll see like everyone on each other's shoulders.
693.0,697.0, And you'll see a mountain of like 10 dudes blasting anything that's forced to funnel down one.
697.0,698.0, One route like zombies.
698.0,702.0," No, those are those are the human versus on the five."
702.0,706.0," Yeah, and then so you see the zombies, a board of Lee rushing at you and he's keep blessing them."
706.0,707.0, That's a zombie skins cool.
707.0,708.0, They're all from half life.
708.0,710.0," Yeah, they're a couple of half life too."
710.0,712.0, So it's all like the head crabs are on the head crab do.
712.0,716.0," Yeah, and there's other basically, you know, the ones that rush really quickly at you."
716.0,718.0, The ones from Ravenholm.
718.0,722.0," If you took off the head on them, they're like, these emaciated wasted little things."
722.0,724.0, So that's that's their benefit. They're really hard to hit.
724.0,726.0, Their heads are like these little pins.
726.0,727.0, And that's certainly weak point.
727.0,729.0, So it's pretty cool.
729.0,731.0, I definitely recommend zombies are always cool.
731.0,733.0, Like a guy for zombies.
733.0,735.0, They can rescue practically any game.
735.0,739.0," You know, that reminds me actually like that one feature that you talk about from zombies strike is the one thing I wish they had in games."
739.0,742.0," Like for stubs, um, stubs the zombie."
742.0,746.0, That had been so cool if you had like a multiplayer mode where you could just like create a whole zombie hoard.
746.0,748.0, And like if you get in the head of humans versus zombies.
748.0,750.0, I could not get into stubs the zombie.
750.0,751.0, I know.
751.0,752.0, I wanted to.
752.0,753.0, I wanted to.
753.0,755.0, I was giving it the minute for the doubt.
755.0,757.0, I wanted to be scary or in less tongue and cheek.
757.0,761.0," I wanted scary zombies, not like farting zombies."
761.0,762.0, Right.
762.0,763.0, I think I'm going into it.
763.0,765.0," You're getting farting zombies, though."
765.0,766.0, I know.
766.0,768.0, You know.
769.0,770.0, Sorry.
770.0,771.0, Yes.
771.0,773.0," I mean, I'm sure zombies probably really do fart."
773.0,775.0," You know, real life."
775.0,776.0, Real zombies.
776.0,778.0, That was over the top.
778.0,779.0, Like that was on the top.
779.0,780.0, It was a little over the top.
780.0,782.0, Not necessarily.
782.0,783.0, Yeah.
783.0,785.0," A lot of full, full on total conversions."
785.0,787.0, Zombie mods for sorcerers still in the military now.
787.0,788.0, She didn't check.
788.0,789.0, Yeah.
789.0,791.0," And then I was and well, it's on be watch next week."
791.0,792.0, But it also stuff.
792.0,796.0, It also kind of like laid out the fact that zombies are really slow.
796.0,799.0, And that's not necessarily all that fun to control and play.
799.0,802.0," Because also we know from 28 days later, they're actually fast."
802.0,803.0, That's true.
803.0,804.0," Man, that's been proven now."
804.0,806.0, I think that's a special period.
806.0,807.0, It goes.
807.0,809.0, It's not be fast on the debate.
809.0,810.0," Oh, yeah."
810.0,812.0, You always come up with this week's special podcast.
812.0,815.0," Oh, in that case, keeps tuned for Dead Island."
815.0,816.0, It's from Techland.
816.0,817.0, It's a Polish developer.
817.0,818.0, They're working on it.
818.0,821.0, It's kind of like a survival horror game on a desert island.
821.0,822.0, So it's.
822.0,823.0, Are they slower fast?
823.0,824.0, Both.
824.0,825.0, Oh.
825.0,826.0, Oh.
826.0,827.0," Oh, oh."
827.0,828.0, That's a separate.
828.0,829.0, It's a separate.
829.0,830.0, It's a separate.
830.0,831.0, It's a separate.
831.0,832.0, Wow.
832.0,833.0, Wow.
833.0,834.0, We had to pull that one.
834.0,835.0, Wow.
835.0,836.0, We did.
836.0,838.0, Did we all play corpse killer here in this room?
838.0,839.0, Yep.
839.0,840.0, We did.
840.0,841.0, Damn.
841.0,843.0, That was one awful game.
843.0,844.0, What was it?
844.0,846.0, Like creepy actors named from that game?
846.0,847.0, Ball dude.
847.0,849.0," He's like, I've seen like a billion movies."
849.0,851.0, Not telly's of all us.
851.0,852.0, Mr. Clean.
852.0,853.0, I don't know.
853.0,854.0, There are someone famous in here.
854.0,855.0," Well, not famous."
855.0,856.0, He's got to be in a Picard.
856.0,857.0, I'm going to look this up later.
857.0,858.0, He's got B.A.
858.0,859.0, I've seen him in a bunch of things.
859.0,860.0, Got a mustache.
860.0,863.0," He's like like, kind of like a go-to-ish kind of thing."
863.0,864.0, I don't know.
864.0,865.0, Ricardo Montelbon.
865.0,866.0," Rich, could have the other."
866.0,867.0, Okay.
867.0,869.0, I'll speak in a.
869.0,870.0," No, that's not speaking of."
870.0,871.0, That was my name.
871.0,872.0, It happened.
872.0,873.0, That was a lesson.
873.0,874.0, I was going to listen.
874.0,876.0, Speaking of the wild movie.
876.0,877.0, Her.
877.0,879.0, I was going to bring up.
879.0,881.0," Well, we were talking about blizzard before."
881.0,884.0, So we know there's a wild-a-wark craft movie announced.
884.0,885.0, Which is already kind of scary.
885.0,886.0, It is.
886.0,889.0, But there's a rumor floating around on our very on-web site.
889.0,894.0, So it must be true that Stephen Spielberg is is pondering directing it.
894.0,895.0, I'm wondering.
895.0,898.0," So it'll be, will it be a call bullshit on that?"
898.0,900.0," Like that's, that's just the biggest fanboy."
900.0,902.0," Oh, you are, you are."
902.0,903.0, Stephen Spielberg.
903.0,904.0, David Rich is going to be.
904.0,905.0, Not.
905.0,906.0, Stephen Spielberg.
906.0,908.0, That's what wild-a-wark craft movie I can see.
908.0,909.0, Yeah.
909.0,911.0," What Stephen Spielberg will be, would be, would be the."
911.0,915.0," Jaws would it be the ET, the Schiller's List or the Munich."
915.0,919.0," Or AI or, or AI or what are some of the other bad ones?"
919.0,921.0, Saving private round is a good one.
921.0,922.0, 1942.
922.0,923.0, Yeah.
923.0,926.0, I can't possibly see that.
926.0,927.0," Oh, wow."
927.0,928.0, Absolutely.
928.0,929.0," How can we actually, how could a world."
929.0,930.0, I think we know immediately.
930.0,932.0," We did the hell, get it directed."
932.0,933.0," Yeah, I know."
933.0,934.0, We want to say.
934.0,935.0, Vey.
935.0,936.0, What was that?
936.0,937.0, What was that?
938.0,940.0, Why do people have to direct?
940.0,942.0, I don't know.
942.0,944.0, What the heck would the movie be about?
944.0,947.0," Why would, you know, I've put in a lot of hours in the world."
947.0,950.0," It's going to be like, no, remember that damn dungeon and dragons move."
950.0,952.0," Oh, God, it's a damn, they're trying to make it funny."
952.0,954.0," And there's going to be like some day, Joe,"
954.0,956.0, and so on is going to level up in the movie.
956.0,957.0, People will be dancing.
957.0,958.0," Oh, go."
958.0,959.0, Yeah.
959.0,960.0, Maybe it'll be about the Sunwell trailer.
960.0,961.0, You should be ashamed.
961.0,964.0, If you're not a scary shun.
965.0,966.0, If someone's listening.
966.0,967.0, Maybe you're right.
967.0,969.0," And heard, you say, you know,"
969.0,970.0, we're the workcraft movie.
970.0,971.0," And immediately, they were like,"
971.0,973.0," Whoa, you need to slow down."
973.0,974.0, I know.
974.0,976.0," You know, this step away from it."
976.0,977.0, The guys are blizzed.
977.0,980.0," It's actually, you're touched about the Sunwell trilogy."
980.0,983.0, But they actually did make a pretty good backstory to the workcraft.
983.0,985.0," Oh, I was at, when I was at Blizzcon,"
985.0,986.0," I said, I'm at Laura Panel."
986.0,987.0," Yeah, it was awesome."
987.0,988.0, Yeah.
988.0,991.0, He was just going off about all this stuff that they're thinking about.
991.0,994.0," And like, it's kind of in some of the quest text if you're paying attention."
994.0,995.0, Yeah.
995.0,996.0, Yeah.
996.0,997.0, Yeah.
997.0,998.0, Think about all this all the time.
998.0,1001.0," I mean, it's pretty close to all the fantasy genres."
1001.0,1002.0, Yeah.
1002.0,1006.0," And they could easily, a Lord of the Rings trilogy sort of thing."
1006.0,1007.0, Yeah.
1007.0,1010.0," I mean, there's a lot more to the game."
1010.0,1011.0, That's the thing.
1011.0,1015.0," Because it's what is the movie is about like a level one guy, you know?"
1015.0,1017.0, A rag to rich history.
1017.0,1019.0, It sounds like it would be more a little more a lot.
1019.0,1020.0," Yeah, more a lot of tales."
1020.0,1023.0," Yeah, more craft story rather than like a world of warcraft story."
1023.0,1024.0, Right.
1024.0,1025.0, Yeah.
1025.0,1027.0," It's like, if you collect five more lockfins,"
1027.0,1029.0, you're going to see like five minutes of the movie.
1029.0,1032.0," Or even like, you know, when they have like the the climatic battle with it,"
1032.0,1035.0, makes you hear something you see the characters are waiting in line for someone else.
1035.0,1036.0," You know,"
1036.0,1037.0, I love it.
1037.0,1038.0, It's going to make it.
1038.0,1039.0, Yeah.
1039.0,1041.0," And like you're, and the leader of your guild is going."
1041.0,1043.0, What the fuck?
1043.0,1045.0," Now, I put it there on your,"
1045.0,1047.0," Yeah, your heroic ending of the movie."
1047.0,1049.0, If there's nothing we're waiting for.
1049.0,1051.0, I think it's all on the wrist bonds at the end.
1051.0,1052.0, Okay.
1052.0,1054.0, So we're saying Spielberg's probably not going to direct us.
1054.0,1056.0, I don't know if people Jackson's doing halo.
1056.0,1057.0, He's not directing that necessarily.
1057.0,1061.0, He's going to make a lot of money no matter who directs it.
1061.0,1062.0," I mean, they don't need to attach."
1062.0,1065.0," So I'm like, I mean, if he's producing it,"
1065.0,1067.0," that's a whole later, different story."
1067.0,1069.0," Like that, that I, that I might buy,"
1069.0,1072.0, but I don't think he'd ever sit down and direct the thing.
1072.0,1075.0, I'd worry about he's Spielberg would cast in the world of warcraft.
1075.0,1077.0," Maybe too, you know."
1077.0,1078.0, The lies you would.
1078.0,1080.0," Yeah, Reese withers bonus."
1080.0,1081.0, Thrall.
1081.0,1083.0, That's what I'm not doing.
1083.0,1085.0, I didn't make any sense.
1085.0,1086.0," McColley, coke in."
1086.0,1090.0, So I've been playing a lot of Half Life 2 episode one.
1090.0,1092.0, I finally jumped on that bandwagon.
1092.0,1095.0, Reinstall the steam on my machine.
1095.0,1098.0," Reluctantly, but then it actually worked really well."
1098.0,1101.0," I, I, I'm here to say."
1101.0,1104.0," I actually, I, I, I, I, I, I never thought I'd"
1104.0,1107.0, say it because boy did I hate it when it first came out.
1107.0,1110.0, But I see it worked pretty much like a dream as you said it would.
1110.0,1112.0, It was well.
1112.0,1113.0," Well, it's good."
1113.0,1117.0," You know, I think I took them after what the first six months after Half Life 2 launched,"
1117.0,1120.0," then it was kind of like, I got a lot of bugs iron out."
1120.0,1122.0," Did you get the box copy or did you buy the,"
1122.0,1124.0," No, I just thought I'd just bought it,"
1124.0,1126.0," essentially online, I bought it late at night."
1126.0,1129.0," And in the morning, it was, you know, installed on my machine."
1129.0,1133.0," So I've been actually having a lot of crashes in the game,"
1133.0,1135.0, but I'm not blaming steam.
1135.0,1137.0," I'm blaming my old video card, I think."
1137.0,1140.0," However, I do like to game a lot a lot."
1140.0,1143.0," And the thing I, I'm liking about it the most,"
1143.0,1147.0," and I think I'm it, I got to say I'm enjoying it more than Half Life 2 itself."
1147.0,1151.0," Is, I like the pacing a little better."
1151.0,1155.0," And I think that the, the puzzles are a bit more creative."
1155.0,1158.0, I've actually had to stop and think a few times.
1158.0,1159.0, Much more than half life.
1159.0,1162.0," I mean, everything ends up being kind of obvious."
1162.0,1164.0, But some of the stuff is really creative.
1164.0,1166.0, The elevator was was awesome.
1166.0,1170.0, The with the debris falling on you is you're going down stuff like that.
1170.0,1172.0," Yeah, and I'm just saying even though it's minimal,"
1172.0,1175.0," I just went back to, I think it's really cool how they"
1175.0,1178.0, develop the interacting between the different characters.
1178.0,1181.0," I mean, just, I don't know, I was just,"
1181.0,1185.0," this past week and I was doing a comparison contrast with the syneposodes and half life,"
1185.0,1187.0, because I'm doing the review first in.
1187.0,1191.0," And it just, it's, I'm reminded of how, like,"
1191.0,1194.0," good job, well, does storytelling."
1194.0,1196.0," Yeah, and I really do."
1196.0,1201.0," Yeah, they, they, I actually can't think of anybody else who really does it like that."
1201.0,1204.0," Who tells a story and a good story,"
1204.0,1208.0," actually in the game without the need to break away to a cutscene,"
1208.0,1211.0, without an overabundance of exposition.
1211.0,1214.0," Now, they're actually, like just hearing the,"
1214.0,1218.0," the stuff on the loudspeakers as you go by, like as you're gaming,"
1218.0,1223.0, really kind of fills in details in a way that I just don't see anybody else doing.
1223.0,1227.0," That definitely makes cutscenes just seem completely, you know,"
1227.0,1228.0, pass a no.
1228.0,1229.0," Well, I think most people, kind of removing the cutscenes,"
1229.0,1232.0," but you still have that, that I'm an operator who knows,"
1232.0,1234.0," who knows, you know, who with the handler back at home Bay,"
1234.0,1236.0," who is, or he's barking out commands and orders,"
1236.0,1238.0, or telling you what's up.
1238.0,1240.0," Do you guys, the first time you play a game,"
1240.0,1241.0, do you sit through the cutscenes?
1241.0,1242.0, I do.
1242.0,1243.0, I do.
1243.0,1244.0, You do.
1244.0,1245.0," Yeah, I end up skipping them."
1245.0,1247.0," Yeah, I have to get a feel for what the story's about."
1247.0,1250.0," I'm the kind of guys, yeah, I'm the kind of guy who, like,"
1250.0,1253.0," if everything's printed out on the screen that someone just said,"
1253.0,1256.0," and I already read it all, I'll still listen while they read it."
1256.0,1257.0, Wow.
1257.0,1259.0," So, one of your managing editor."
1259.0,1262.0, That's just a couple of typos.
1262.0,1264.0, And then in proper diction.
1264.0,1268.0," There's a lot of typos and the heroes of mine magic five cutscenes,"
1268.0,1271.0," you know, in the subtitles."
1271.0,1272.0, Less than translation.
1272.0,1273.0, Yeah.
1273.0,1276.0," Um, getting the cut line."
1276.0,1277.0," So, okay."
1277.0,1279.0," So, we're going to break for our sponsor."
1279.0,1282.0, And we'll be back in a minute.
1282.0,1284.0, One up now.
1284.0,1285.0, We're great.
1285.0,1289.0, He was being brought to you by Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Chapter 2 content.
1289.0,1294.0, That's an all new downloadable content package coming up for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.

1305.0,1309.0," Hi, this is garnet Lee host of One Up Years."

1329.0,1333.0," So, any computer entertainment takes no responsibility for this offer."
1334.0,1336.0," And we're back, see?"
1336.0,1338.0, So fast through the magic of radio.
1338.0,1341.0, It's like we didn't even hear it.
1341.0,1345.0," But whatever that was, it's a fine sponsor."
1345.0,1349.0," You just, it's a wonderful, wonderful product."
1349.0,1351.0," I mean, we highly recommend you get it."
1351.0,1353.0, Whatever the heck it was.
1353.0,1355.0, So you just proved the magic.
1355.0,1357.0, I'll be from Activision Wrong.
1357.0,1358.0, Right there.
1358.0,1359.0, That's right.
1359.0,1364.0, I was going to read you guys a quote that showed up apparently in the New York Times this morning.
1364.0,1369.0," And if this quote is wrong and he didn't say this, then I blame one up.com."
1369.0,1373.0, Guess this is on there from page that I scribbled it down.
1373.0,1380.0, It says this is the CEO of Activision said this in an article about games.
1380.0,1388.0," He said, quote, the idea of full downloadable games is so far in the future that it's almost"
1388.0,1390.0, incomprehensible.
1390.0,1392.0," Boy, that's wackiness."
1392.0,1395.0, What would wild do without him?
1395.0,1398.0, It was the topic of a good interview.
1398.0,1407.0," The context of that was sales and video games and general, the client and the CD market and how we're going to pump things back up."
1407.0,1411.0," I don't think that was the point of the article, but I think that's something he said on."
1411.0,1420.0," I think he's not even just saying, you know, it's an idea who's to the who's time will come, but we don't know exactly when it will come across the board."
1420.0,1422.0, It's so comprehensible.
1422.0,1424.0, I think it's incomprehensible to him.
1424.0,1431.0, Maybe it's like we are sending him to valve.com or telltale games or how about how about how
1431.0,1435.0, how about he boots up that Xbox 360 and looks at all this stuff happening on live arcade.
1435.0,1449.0," Yeah, I think it goes on to say that, you know, he and some of the other folks who are still not completely solved are more into the idea of downloadable content of a game that you've already bought on a disk like that they can get behind."
1449.0,1450.0, Right.
1450.0,1457.0," The idea of fully being able to, of buying a full game online, he sees as apparently incomprehensible because it's so fun to future."
1457.0,1460.0, Is it referring just to consoles or PCs?
1460.0,1465.0," Obviously if he's referring to PC, there you can do that already, so I don't understand."
1465.0,1468.0," Yeah, I'm hoping he's just referring to console games."
1468.0,1472.0," I mean, in that respect, I mean, I could see some sense, but now let's say he's full of crap anyway."
1472.0,1473.0, All right.
1473.0,1474.0, Just kidding.
1474.0,1476.0, Hard drive on the PS3.
1476.0,1478.0, I know we're just kidding.
1478.0,1479.0, We love Activision.
1479.0,1483.0," Wait, I take a stand there."
1483.0,1488.0, Sorry.
1488.0,1494.0," Every month there's some publisher mad at us, so maybe it's active as mentioned this month."
1494.0,1496.0," Yeah, we eagerly await the phone calls."
1496.0,1497.0, Right.
1497.0,1498.0, It's not them.
1498.0,1505.0," I mean, but that's an, if that really is as perspective and it really is about PC games, that says a lot."
1505.0,1510.0," I think, I mean, that says it does huge perception humps to get over here."
1510.0,1511.0, Yeah.
1511.0,1513.0, That's a lot of a game company is really thinking that.
1513.0,1515.0, And even if it is about the console.
1515.0,1519.0," Well, I guess, the thing is like, you know, we're the early adopters."
1519.0,1520.0," Yeah, we are."
1520.0,1522.0, So we're the guys buying into this advanced technology.
1522.0,1526.0," It's the people that target and Walmart, the people that are making the major sales, the keep these companies a flow."
1526.0,1532.0," But does the same people that buy it, it games that target Walmart now are already used to downloading ring tones for their cell phones."
1532.0,1533.0, Very true.
1533.0,1534.0, Getting music that way.
1534.0,1537.0," I mean, I think they're all the cards are in place."
1537.0,1538.0, Right.
1538.0,1540.0, But it's a big difference when you're talking about like a two gigabyte game.
1540.0,1541.0, Right.
1541.0,1542.0, That's why that's a hard drive device.
1542.0,1548.0, That's why I point out like PS3 is going to have quite a enormous hard drive on by my console standards.
1548.0,1550.0," Yeah, but how big is that hard drive?"
1550.0,1553.0, And you can also swap mount on the Xbox.
1553.0,1557.0," So I mean, it's not it's definitely not incomprehensible on either of those."
1557.0,1561.0," I mean, that's to say if he's talking about that, that's based."
1561.0,1565.0," Yeah, I think it's the extreme of that quote is what's kind of surprising."
1565.0,1566.0, Right.
1566.0,1568.0," And all fairness though, you know how much journalists suck."
1568.0,1571.0, Sometimes they do have to go on one up.
1571.0,1572.0," Oh, I get it."
1572.0,1573.0," Oh, my goodness."
1573.0,1574.0," Hey, no."
1574.0,1576.0," No, but sometimes they have it."
1576.0,1580.0, They'll have it in a agenda and they'll like selectively pull that quote apart.
1580.0,1581.0, That's true.
1581.0,1584.0," So maybe he, you know, we would never do that."
1584.0,1585.0," No, never."
1585.0,1591.0, Because we're trying to like the boring Monday morning press release batch from Activision and scan through it and
1591.0,1595.0, found one slightly possibly incendiary comment.
1595.0,1598.0," Yeah, we know."
1598.0,1603.0, Maybe I'd like to read the comments to do a little more research before we actually discuss something on the podcast.
1603.0,1605.0, So now we just killed five minutes.
1605.0,1606.0, Yeah.
1606.0,1607.0, What funny actually say?
1607.0,1608.0, I don't know.
1608.0,1610.0, I'll say forgot to record that section.
1610.0,1611.0," Oh, yeah."
1611.0,1613.0," How's it going over there, in the matter?"
1613.0,1614.0, Pretty good.
1614.0,1615.0, Yeah.
1615.0,1617.0," Still lines moving, which is very encouraging."
1617.0,1619.0," Lots of beeping, lots of flanking dots."
1619.0,1622.0, The red light that's not supposed to go on has not gone on.
1622.0,1623.0, Excellent.
1624.0,1627.0," Well, you got time to talk about your gaming lovers."
1627.0,1628.0, Okay.
1628.0,1629.0, Okay.
1629.0,1631.0," Now, when we say our gaming lovers,"
1631.0,1633.0, we actually talked about.
1633.0,1634.0, We're talking about the game.
1634.0,1635.0, We'll let you always talk.
1635.0,1636.0, Yeah.
1636.0,1637.0, Yeah.
1637.0,1638.0, No.
1638.0,1641.0," We were talking about last week about, you know, online romance or whatever."
1641.0,1644.0, We figured we could do it with our YouTube and Nurem because it could actually be a mature discussion.
1644.0,1645.0," Oh, I see."
1645.0,1648.0, We had giant breaking down the sex talk.
1648.0,1649.0, Actually was Jane.
1649.0,1652.0, We had Jane from one up show.
1652.0,1653.0," Oh, that's right."
1653.0,1656.0, Who up to the maturity level quite a bit.
1656.0,1662.0," However, she is the one as somebody pointed out to me and my blog in a blog comment."
1662.0,1664.0, She said the word tits first.
1664.0,1665.0, She did that.
1665.0,1668.0, It was great because it totally opened it up to say it after she did.
1668.0,1670.0," It's like, all right, the girl said it first."
1670.0,1671.0, I'll let you have to set it.
1671.0,1673.0, And now I'll open it up to you.
1673.0,1676.0, I have to listen to podcast.
1676.0,1677.0, It was good.
1677.0,1678.0, We said the word tits.
1678.0,1680.0, Apparently.
1681.0,1688.0," No, but when you say gaming lovers, I was actually, I meant our real life partner of spouses."
1688.0,1692.0," What I know, I just said it because it sounds like goofy like adult beef swelling."
1692.0,1694.0," You're my, you're making me gaming love."
1694.0,1696.0," Because it's, uh, it's an issue."
1696.0,1697.0, We all face isn't it?
1697.0,1702.0," We're kind of all of us here in this room and even Ryan, believe it or not, this interrelationship."
1702.0,1704.0," And, uh, we have to, I should say it."
1704.0,1705.0, Ryan.
1706.0,1707.0, You're not here.
1707.0,1710.0," If you're, if you can't make the podcast, that's what you get, you know."
1710.0,1712.0, It's definitely your root canal for some other time.
1712.0,1713.0, You're probably already straight.
1713.0,1714.0," Yeah, it is."
1714.0,1715.0, It's a blessing.
1715.0,1728.0," Yeah, no, we all to some degree have to deal with this, like, you know, I mean, well, let me just ask Sean."
1728.0,1729.0, Elliott.
1729.0,1730.0, This is topic.
1730.0,1731.0, I like to talk about it.
1731.0,1734.0," Does that, does your, does your partner play games?"
1734.0,1735.0, Yes.
1735.0,1737.0," And, and or tolerate you playing games?"
1737.0,1748.0," She does, but, uh, yes, so basically, I mean, a long stereotypical line is almost where she's definitely in, she plays but jooled like crazy bunnies book store girls love that stuff."
1748.0,1749.0, Right.
1749.0,1754.0," All the, so all the pop cap games, big, fiend form and then, you know, Nintendo games with me, DS, warrior, where and that sort of thing."
1754.0,1755.0, Mm-hmm.
1755.0,1756.0, Definitely another shooter's.
1756.0,1761.0," And the problem then is that since I play all these damn shooters, is they all look like the same game to her."
1761.0,1762.0, Mm-hmm.
1762.0,1767.0," So I could be playing, you know, Red Ark is still one minute called to do the next thing in the course of an hour, literally go through it,"
1767.0,1771.0," Audink Count of Strike battlefield, and I'm always playing the same game."
1771.0,1776.0," And, right, and when I come, you know, when I bring home a game and I'm like, hey, this is for review."
1776.0,1778.0," Right, and the story on this, I have to play it."
1778.0,1780.0, And it's about field expansion.
1780.0,1783.0," It's like, she's, you know, she's like, don't quit lying to me."
1783.0,1784.0, I know what you're doing.
1784.0,1785.0, I know what you're doing.
1785.0,1786.0, I know what you're doing.
1786.0,1787.0, It's good for an off at the same bowl game.
1787.0,1791.0," So yeah, and it's tough because, uh, yeah, I mean, you definitely, I mean, there's kind of a,"
1791.0,1792.0, you sort of right.
1792.0,1793.0, Yeah.
1793.0,1795.0," So there, guys, again."
1795.0,1799.0," But the other thing is, too, is it's, I think that anyone that's, that's in a relationship has"
1799.0,1803.0," got to deal with it, that there's going to be some kind of disparity between the commitment to the gaming,"
1803.0,1808.0," you know, and it's like, they're definitely times when I want to come home and play and getting to you"
1808.0,1811.0, speak and just yell and goof off and clown.
1811.0,1814.0," And then she comes in for that room and it's like, what the hell are you doing?"
1814.0,1818.0," You know, even the whole notion are you embarrassed and how much I'm out of the room?"
1818.0,1819.0," Yeah, I don't know."
1819.0,1824.0," You know, me, I'm pretty like pretty, I mean, to bear a spent night like to embarrass myself."
1824.0,1829.0," So, but I'll just, you know, I'll be on there talking in insane voices and stuff and"
1829.0,1830.0, rest.
1830.0,1838.0," You actually hit on the one big outtow that we all have here, then your average gamer doesn't."
1838.0,1839.0, Right?
1839.0,1841.0," Which is, we're doing this for real."
1841.0,1847.0," But it's kind of, it's a double edge sort of because it's like when you definitely, there will be times when you really are working and,"
1847.0,1856.0," and, and, and, and, and, and, and, we're playing my girlfriend most just doesn't buy it. She's like, yeah, or it's just because what we do is so divorced from so many people's notions of work."
1856.0,1862.0," And because for one, a lot of people just assume all we do is sit around and play games and we know that we definitely don't do that."
1862.0,1863.0, That's a good idea.
1863.0,1867.0," But, but in the cases when we that the awesome part, you know, when we do get to play games,"
1867.0,1869.0, it doesn't seem like work to anyone.
1869.0,1873.0," And it really isn't at the same time, but, but the bottom of it is we have to do it."
1873.0,1877.0," I want by OPM today, official PlayStation Magazine. I walked by Joe Rubiky's obviously."
1877.0,1878.0, He's a tech developer.
1878.0,1881.0, He's sitting back in his chair with the guitar from Guitar Hero.
1881.0,1882.0, That's cool.
1882.0,1884.0," Playing it, I'm like, I can't believe this is some guy's job."
1884.0,1885.0, Yeah.
1885.0,1886.0, That's amazing.
1886.0,1888.0," Or it's like, you know, an episode one came out."
1888.0,1889.0, I just spent the day playing that.
1889.0,1891.0," Yeah, but that really was your job."
1891.0,1892.0," Yeah, and that's good."
1892.0,1896.0," But I mean, it's kind of the up, I mean, there's a million things I could say, but one thing just"
1896.0,1899.0, thing you saying about your girlfriend not buying it.
1899.0,1904.0," Sometimes what happens with my wife is the opposite, which is that if I tell her it's work,"
1904.0,1908.0, she's actually angry because she thinks I just work too much.
1908.0,1909.0, That's exactly how she is.
1909.0,1914.0," It's almost better if I say I'm just goofing off because then she doesn't feel like, you know,"
1914.0,1917.0, ziff the man and have the other thing too.
1917.0,1920.0, There's no one between because like our hobby is what we do.
1920.0,1922.0, What we love doing is also our job.
1922.0,1923.0, Right.
1923.0,1924.0, Yeah.
1924.0,1928.0," When you go home and you're like, you know, I've been at work all day and I'm feeling to play some"
1928.0,1931.0," games and I feel too and and she's like, what are you talking about?"
1931.0,1934.0," You just played games all day and I was like, no, I didn't have a play to game it"
1934.0,1935.0, work in like two weeks.
1935.0,1937.0, You can hear the total voice I'm used to doing it.
1937.0,1941.0," Actually, I could play the game at work."
1941.0,1942.0, The deal.
1942.0,1943.0, The deal.
1943.0,1947.0, I think you actually have Mike and my apartment because that's the same exact conversation
1947.0,1948.0, that I have at the time.
1948.0,1951.0," Yeah, actually, I can't do that anymore because we've had too many arguments."
1951.0,1954.0, I can't walk in the door and go to a game.
1954.0,1955.0," On by the way, this was,"
1955.0,1957.0, I have to pay attention to my wife and kid.
1957.0,1958.0, Sheesh.
1958.0,1959.0, Sheesh.
1959.0,1962.0," Yeah, this actually was going to be my column this month."
1962.0,1963.0, But now I'm not going to do it.
1963.0,1964.0, Thanks guys.
1964.0,1965.0," No, you could just do it."
1965.0,1967.0," I think the stoppicks pretty, pretty endless."
1967.0,1970.0," Yeah, this is so much good stuff to have me just thinking of it."
1970.0,1972.0," Well, the one thing I got to say that was like Amy,"
1972.0,1975.0," when we first started dating, she wasn't in the house."
1975.0,1977.0, She basically said that she's not a gamer at all.
1977.0,1978.0, She hated stuff.
1978.0,1980.0, She played the mist when she was younger and that was about it.
1980.0,1983.0," And then I introduced you to Grim fan Dango and you know,"
1983.0,1986.0," once I'm on the, I got my hands on a cool, like an adventure game that she might like."
1986.0,1987.0, And she starts playing it.
1987.0,1989.0, And I introduced her to guitar hero and she's hooked on that.
1989.0,1993.0, And so there is nothing I can do to get my wife into gaming.
1993.0,1994.0, That's the best.
1994.0,1996.0, The thing that I learned at least with nothing at all.
1996.0,1997.0, You've done everything.
1997.0,1998.0," I tried all the, all the gutheries."
1998.0,2001.0, Everything you could think of really throw at me.
2001.0,2004.0," Well, like even she's immune to be jeweled."
2004.0,2005.0, And you need to be jeweled.
2005.0,2006.0, Wow.
2006.0,2008.0," The unit book, where we're new to,"
2008.0,2009.0, the little brain age.
2009.0,2011.0," The, like I found that work for me was just like,"
2011.0,2013.0, basically I would have the controller on my hand.
2013.0,2015.0, We do a puzzle game or adventure game.
2015.0,2017.0," And I'm like, Amy, boss me around."
2017.0,2019.0, She knows how to do that.
2019.0,2021.0," So my daughter told me,"
2021.0,2023.0," She's, she's, she's actually really."
2023.0,2028.0," I thought, so my wife, I think you guys do role playing in her boss."
2028.0,2029.0, Being the boss.
2029.0,2030.0, That's what I got scared of.
2030.0,2031.0, Yeah.
2031.0,2033.0," Well, it's, oh shit."
2033.0,2035.0, The podcast six and nasty turn.
2035.0,2036.0, Wow.
2036.0,2037.0," Okay, back on track."
2037.0,2038.0, Yeah.
2038.0,2041.0, I'm looking because my boyfriend is as into it as I am.
2041.0,2043.0, If not more in one of the cases is very cool.
2043.0,2045.0," So I got, I got to, I got to go with a soul caliber."
2045.0,2048.0," But you have to, like, yeah, pretty much it's also dangerous."
2048.0,2051.0, You have to argue though over like the controller or the game or.
2051.0,2052.0," Sometimes, but you, I mean,"
2052.0,2055.0," Wow, it was kind of what we settled on as the default thing when we can't agree on."
2055.0,2057.0," Like, what did you want to play D away?"
2057.0,2058.0," And like, yeah."
2058.0,2059.0," You know, we play, you set up."
2059.0,2060.0," Hey, I like to."
2060.0,2061.0, So you guys play together.
2061.0,2062.0, He's at his desktop.
2062.0,2064.0, And I'm usually at the laptop on the couch.
2064.0,2065.0, And do you play together?
2065.0,2066.0," Yeah, I do."
2066.0,2067.0," Yeah, they're kind of good."
2067.0,2068.0, That's pretty cool.
2068.0,2069.0, Yeah.
2069.0,2070.0," And in fact, that's, that's awesome."
2070.0,2071.0," You know, I actually haven't tried that."
2071.0,2072.0, You haven't tried to get her on MMOs.
2072.0,2074.0," You know, I'm afraid I might create a monster."
2074.0,2076.0," Yeah, I've done it now with my daughter."
2076.0,2080.0," Um, in fact, just today, I got Eggbird, my character moved up into her server."
2080.0,2082.0," So now we're, I've really on the same side."
2082.0,2085.0," I've heard horror stories from friends because who, you know, we're,"
2085.0,2086.0, and then moving together.
2086.0,2089.0," And then like, they had different,"
2089.0,2091.0, They got in different guilds or something.
2091.0,2093.0," And then they like, it ended in divorce."
2093.0,2094.0, Yeah.
2094.0,2096.0," And then like, literally that is that was the conclusion."
2096.0,2097.0, That is.
2097.0,2098.0," I just like, I traced it backwards."
2098.0,2100.0," I'm just like, they got divorced over that."
2100.0,2101.0, Look at the story.
2101.0,2103.0, I love bites and our current.
2103.0,2104.0," Yeah, exactly."
2104.0,2107.0, Like they get to the point where you're looking over each other's shoulder.
2107.0,2108.0, At least that's some of the people in there.
2108.0,2110.0," You know, they're looking over each other's shoulder."
2110.0,2111.0," See, like, what were you talking to in game?"
2111.0,2112.0, Why are they pimming you?
2112.0,2115.0," Why don't they say, yeah, when I say, oh, you know,"
2115.0,2116.0," I'm like, if there's a danger too."
2116.0,2119.0," That's like, like, do you guys, like, what I would"
2119.0,2120.0, wonder about?
2120.0,2123.0," Cause in a way, you know, my wife and this is what she says."
2123.0,2126.0," I don't know if somebody's got to run the household, you know,"
2126.0,2127.0, and there's a little bit of tooth to that.
2127.0,2130.0," If I'm just sitting on my ass, I'll wake in front of the PC."
2130.0,2132.0," Working, I should say yes."
2132.0,2134.0, Working earn her money.
2134.0,2139.0," That if two people are, are, like, do you ever think like, man,"
2139.0,2141.0, we should get up and stop doing this.
2141.0,2142.0," Oh, yeah."
2142.0,2143.0, That kind of thing.
2143.0,2144.0," We actually think, you know, we do that though."
2144.0,2146.0, We make a point like this weekend was just beautiful.
2146.0,2147.0," Oh, yeah, you can't do that."
2147.0,2150.0, I don't think we maybe be playing an hour of games.
2150.0,2152.0, I think the fundamental difference between your situation and ours is that
2152.0,2157.0," like, we can, we'd all, or, I mean, all of us in a room are aware of just like,"
2157.0,2160.0, how completely geeked out this stuff gets.
2160.0,2163.0," And I mean, and it's like, for us, I'm assuming there's places you don't go."
2163.0,2166.0, You don't even start to try to explain it joke because you realize how much
2166.0,2168.0," context is like, yeah, to take me all day to set this up,"
2168.0,2170.0, my stomach gets to the punch line.
2170.0,2172.0," Should be like, why is that funny?"
2172.0,2173.0, Yeah.
2173.0,2176.0," But both of you are like, what we're laughing at this."
2176.0,2178.0, And we know why it's funny.
2178.0,2179.0," Like, but is it really funny?"
2179.0,2180.0, I don't know.
2180.0,2183.0," I just imagine you think like, it would be weird."
2183.0,2184.0, Yeah.
2184.0,2189.0," I mean, you guys are both, it's really aware of how far you're going down the rabbit hole."
2189.0,2190.0, When you guys are really happy.
2190.0,2191.0, I'm jealous of you.
2191.0,2193.0," I was like, playing it off to..."
2193.0,2194.0, I am jealous.
2194.0,2198.0," I would like once in a while to be able to have, I mean, I do have that experience with my kid."
2198.0,2202.0," But it's rough when you got someone in the house who's just like, what you're doing is a waste of time."
2202.0,2204.0," You know, 20% of your money."
2204.0,2205.0, Right.
2205.0,2207.0," I'm not trying to, I'm dissing my wife in public."
2207.0,2208.0, This is bad.
2208.0,2209.0," Oh, I love you, honey."
2209.0,2210.0," That's going to be rough, though."
2210.0,2212.0," No matter what, I mean, because I've had that tune in."
2212.0,2215.0," It's like, it's similar to that like, what you do is not work."
2215.0,2220.0," And I'm thinking not so much of what we're playing in, but say when we're, you know, we have a rough week, a deadline,"
2220.0,2226.0," and we're basically, you know, writing it home, writing over the weekend, editing, preparing stuff for the next issue at the same time."
2226.0,2228.0," And those days, you'll least, it's still very nice."
2228.0,2229.0, Love it.
2229.0,2231.0," Rather be doing it than, you know, so many other things."
2231.0,2234.0," But at the same time, it's kind of in line too."
2234.0,2238.0," It's just so, anytime someone you love, it's just so merely dismisses a big chunk of what you're investing in."
2238.0,2247.0," Yeah, it's like, you know, it's just my career here, you know, and, you know, to put it into some context, I mean, first of all, she's European."
2247.0,2250.0, So she wants to play Raymond.
2250.0,2253.0," No, but also that's, that's nothing."
2253.0,2254.0, That's nothing.
2254.0,2257.0," Yeah, that's what I was really going to say was she's a teacher."
2257.0,2259.0," Okay, she's a high school teacher."
2259.0,2260.0, So she's got to deal with.
2260.0,2263.0, She's not using DDR to teach the kids to lose weight.
2263.0,2267.0," Yeah, what I'm doing, what I do is like the enemy of what she does."
2267.0,2269.0," You know, this was like why they don't fight in kids."
2269.0,2271.0, Don't do their homework.
2271.0,2273.0, It's quite a dynamic relationship together.
2273.0,2277.0," Yeah, we always say that, you know, she smartened some up and I dumb them down."
2277.0,2281.0," It would be a really talented way to send the NELCIFT it wasn't the games, you know?"
2281.0,2282.0," Yeah, I don't know."
2282.0,2286.0," But what bugs me too is like, you know, everyone's in a while."
2286.0,2289.0," There is a game that I really think I'm like, this is the one."
2289.0,2294.0," Like, Catamaria, I think was one where I was like, this is so innovative and it's so cute and it's so friendly."
2294.0,2295.0, I knew better than that.
2295.0,2297.0, I just glaze it to a lot of interest.
2297.0,2302.0," Play it, just watch me play it to acknowledge that there's something interesting happening here."
2302.0,2309.0," I mean, the last thing she saw me play was half-life episode two and episode one and I was playing it and I was really into it."
2309.0,2314.0," And she, it was like a good part of the story and she walked by and like right then on the screen."
2314.0,2317.0," There was of course, you know, something like horrible happening."
2317.0,2321.0," Like I was using the gravity gun to like throw bricks at zombie hits, right?"
2321.0,2322.0," Well, this wasn't a student."
2322.0,2325.0," So she walked by that and she's like, what is that?"
2325.0,2327.0, Like in the most dismissive time.
2327.0,2328.0, Why you're not playing it?
2328.0,2333.0, All you see is nothing but violence upon violence upon violence and you don't see.
2333.0,2335.0," I mean, now I got to go into Finn."
2335.0,2336.0, What?
2336.0,2337.0, It's not just violence.
2337.0,2339.0," But in the way that you're responding, you're like, what do you see how that happened?"
2339.0,2342.0," Or like, I got to figure out using the tools available to me."
2342.0,2343.0, Yeah.
2343.0,2344.0, How to get out of the situation.
2344.0,2348.0, All they see is that if you're like watching a movie and it was like an endless clip of like highlights.
2348.0,2353.0," Like, like, cresty old, you know, like puppet master films and whatever, you know,"
2353.0,2354.0, trauma of the show.
2354.0,2355.0, But studios.
2355.0,2359.0, What does actually the scene was that it was the part of the game where the
2359.0,2361.0, Ant Lions are spawning and they'll see.
2361.0,2365.0, So you have to use the gravity card to move the cars over to move the gravity gun.
2365.0,2367.0, The cars are there to spoil one of the puzzles.
2367.0,2368.0, Sorry.
2368.0,2372.0," But anyway, Alex is the one that says it like two seconds."
2372.0,2373.0," Oh, she does."
2373.0,2374.0, I guess that was the deal.
2374.0,2375.0, I don't know if she says that.
2375.0,2376.0, Yeah.
2376.0,2377.0, I didn't even hear it.
2377.0,2378.0, I missed it.
2378.0,2379.0, I thought I had to figure it out.
2379.0,2384.0," But you know, so my wife was like, dicing the game because the zombies are attacking you."
2384.0,2387.0, And I was actually trying to mount this defense over it.
2387.0,2389.0, So it's kind of a logic puzzle.
2389.0,2391.0," Oh, it's all over the heads."
2391.0,2392.0, Yeah.
2392.0,2393.0," All the time, I tried to sit there into a fan."
2393.0,2395.0," Like, you know, gaming is evolving as an art form."
2395.0,2396.0, And I was sitting there playing syneposites for the review.
2396.0,2397.0, And the first opening scene.
2397.0,2398.0, I'm staring at some digital boobs.
2398.0,2399.0," Yeah, that is."
2399.0,2400.0, That's it.
2400.0,2401.0, There you go.
2401.0,2402.0, Yeah.
2402.0,2403.0, That would have been harsh.
2403.0,2404.0, Yeah.
2404.0,2405.0, She's going to have a team.
2405.0,2406.0, She can't drop the F bomb on here.
2406.0,2408.0," But anyway, as soon as that part, you get in the car."
2408.0,2409.0, I've been in the corner F F F F.
2409.0,2411.0, The quarter of F and you.
2411.0,2412.0, Yeah.
2412.0,2414.0," Actually, that and the team A together would just be a."
2414.0,2415.0, Yeah.
2415.0,2418.0," She said, like, he's a time to have a negative like shoot themselves in the foot."
2418.0,2420.0," Where you're just like, see, this is really cool."
2420.0,2421.0," Oh, yeah."
2421.0,2424.0," I mean, I actually tried to like sort of take."
2424.0,2430.0," I mean, I do feel this way that like if it's if the game you're playing is stupid or whatever."
2430.0,2431.0," Like, that's actually okay."
2432.0,2434.0," You know, just say the way we want to do it."
2434.0,2438.0, If you have a exactly what you got to stupid movies or read stupid books.
2438.0,2440.0," Like, if this is just how you want to spend your time."
2440.0,2441.0, I think that's.
2441.0,2446.0," I think if you had someone come up to you, if your wife can't have team was trying to tell you that like,"
2446.0,2450.0," I don't know, Miss Congeniality was just, it's just amazing."
2450.0,2452.0," I mean, it's just completely high art."
2452.0,2453.0, Yeah.
2453.0,2454.0, And it's you.
2454.0,2455.0, Absolutely sincere.
2455.0,2456.0, And you had to listen to it.
2456.0,2458.0, And she ran it movies like it.
2458.0,2459.0, And it's sequels like every week.
2459.0,2460.0, We get a week out.
2460.0,2464.0, And then that's kind of probably her perspective on what we do.
2464.0,2470.0," You know, it's like, that is if you're not telling your hey, this is a dumb like this is a guilty pleasure."
2470.0,2473.0," I'm sorry, but like, well, it's not the reality."
2473.0,2479.0," I'd you know, I'll do about sometimes I really do try to defend it because there are games you can defend."
2479.0,2486.0," As, you know, strategy games or things like that, you can say this is actually using a a significant part of my brain."
2486.0,2491.0," You know, there's other times where clearly you're just goofing off and wasting time."
2491.0,2496.0," Maybe you need to start simple with her, start her on some flash games like torture or some or something."
2496.0,2498.0, I always think it's a good thing.
2498.0,2500.0," This seriously, like, elf bowling or something."
2500.0,2501.0, I don't know.
2501.0,2503.0, Maybe something from a French perspective since she's friend.
2503.0,2506.0," Get her into, I don't know."
2506.0,2507.0, I give up.
2507.0,2515.0," Yeah, but all takes is one like the fact that like if they play just one game, then even if the game content itself is completely different than what you're doing."
2515.0,2527.0," The, the concept of like wanting to keep playing something, you know, in the same medium like saying, hey, you know, I know that feeling where I want to go back and keep playing this and just do it again, even though I've done it the day before in the day before that, you know."
2527.0,2529.0, Bookworm and Bonnie's book show might be a good thing.
2529.0,2531.0, So maybe it doesn't matter.
2531.0,2532.0, Maybe it's okay.
2532.0,2534.0," You know, yeah, there's sweat and if or none."
2534.0,2538.0," Does she watch Oprah or anything like that, you can bring and shoot back."
2538.0,2539.0, She definitely watch to some dumb TV.
2539.0,2540.0, There you go.
2540.0,2541.0, That's it.
2541.0,2545.0," And, and her, you know, the way she'll say it is, well, you know, I've been teaching all day."
2545.0,2548.0, I've been working hard all day and now I just want to turn my brain off and chill out.
2548.0,2549.0," Yeah, there you go."
2549.0,2550.0, And there you go.
2550.0,2551.0, There's the argument.
2551.0,2552.0, Right.
2552.0,2553.0, Yeah.
2553.0,2554.0, Okay.
2554.0,2555.0, That's the end of it then.
2555.0,2556.0, Amen.
2556.0,2558.0," Well, why did the habit of turning to a therapy session?"
2558.0,2559.0, Okay.
2559.0,2561.0, And you just thought I was asking you guys a question.
2561.0,2562.0," Well, you part of it."
2562.0,2563.0, We want to know.
2563.0,2565.0," Yeah, but that I feel bad."
2565.0,2566.0, We're in for you.
2566.0,2568.0, We think what you're doing is worthwhile.
2568.0,2569.0, We're behind the.
2569.0,2570.0, We said it.
2570.0,2571.0, We're here in the delights.
2571.0,2572.0, We're here in the delights.
2572.0,2575.0, We're here in the delights.
2575.0,2577.0," I have a good job, because of it."
2577.0,2580.0, So what would she say if she heard this podcast?
2580.0,2583.0, It wouldn't be good.
2583.0,2586.0," Matter of fact, something that he makes it good right now."
2586.0,2587.0," Yeah, about five seconds."
2587.0,2588.0, I love you.
2588.0,2590.0, Love you honey.
2590.0,2591.0, Yeah.
2591.0,2592.0, Are we done?
2592.0,2593.0, That's it.
2593.0,2594.0, We're done.
2594.0,2596.0, You just want to throw out two quick things?
2596.0,2597.0, No.
2597.0,2598.0, Yes.
2598.0,2600.0, They see you W podcast theme.
2600.0,2601.0, Yeah.
2601.0,2603.0, So we got we got to throw a shout out.
2603.0,2605.0, We got an interest admission from George Teal.
2605.0,2606.0, Yes.
2606.0,2607.0, And thank you George.
2607.0,2608.0, Thank you George.
2608.0,2610.0, While we can't use the theme.
2610.0,2611.0, Yeah.
2611.0,2612.0, What were you saying earlier?
2612.0,2613.0, Don't say it.
2613.0,2614.0, Don't judge mental.
2614.0,2615.0, I thought it was in the cool.
2615.0,2616.0, All right.
2616.0,2618.0, I think that you need to hook up.
2618.0,2620.0," I mean, for being the first and so far,"
2620.0,2621.0," only submission, right?"
2621.0,2622.0, Yeah.
2622.0,2623.0, George is actually.
2623.0,2624.0, We should say it.
2624.0,2627.0, It's the guy who did the one that Ryan called Columbia and drug dealer.
2627.0,2628.0, And he's a glass week.
2628.0,2632.0, And we thought a little bad because he actually did take the time to do this for us.
2632.0,2634.0, Unlike the rest of you.
2634.0,2637.0, And so I heard that he sent us a new one today.
2637.0,2638.0, And this new one is nice.
2638.0,2639.0, Thank you George.
2639.0,2641.0," So George, you'll be getting any email from you soon."
2641.0,2642.0, I'll hook you up with some stuff.
2642.0,2643.0, Thanks.
2643.0,2646.0, Thanks for for throwing some songs away.
2646.0,2650.0," And one other thing, the get a life contest for."
2650.0,2653.0, That's this play.
2653.0,2654.0, So I'll make you laugh.
2654.0,2655.0, That's okay.
2656.0,2658.0, You don't know how you've made it face.
2658.0,2663.0," And also, I know that we had this two weeks ago."
2663.0,2664.0, The get out.
2664.0,2666.0, You can see how pathetic your life is from playing to play games.
2666.0,2667.0, Yeah.
2667.0,2668.0, So I know there are a couple entries.
2668.0,2669.0, And I was out of it down last week.
2669.0,2671.0, But quite a few you just see them on your phones.
2671.0,2672.0, I saw a couple of them.
2672.0,2674.0, So I'm just going to give it one more week if you have any more entries.
2674.0,2678.0, They take a screenshot and how many hours you've logged in any game.
2678.0,2680.0," And the winner, I'm just going to send some hardware to."
2680.0,2684.0, So are you going to pick a winner based on just pure hour input?
2684.0,2687.0, Or like combine that with like you should have some.
2687.0,2689.0, I'm thinking you should give it a good question.
2689.0,2692.0, A curve based on like help pathetic the game is.
2692.0,2693.0, Okay.
2693.0,2694.0, You know.
2694.0,2695.0, That's what you're thinking.
2695.0,2697.0," If it's 800 hours and hours, galaxies."
2697.0,2698.0, Yeah.
2698.0,2699.0, You get bonus points for it.
2699.0,2700.0, Exactly.
2700.0,2702.0," So it's like, wow, you know, 300 or 400 hours."
2702.0,2705.0, Like that's pretty much a normal American.
2705.0,2706.0, Okay.
2706.0,2707.0, So we'll do eight hours.
2707.0,2708.0, Okay.
2708.0,2709.0, Okay.
2709.0,2711.0, I say two scales.
2711.0,2713.0, One for most pathetic and one.
2713.0,2714.0, Okay.
2714.0,2715.0, So two awards.
2715.0,2716.0, Two awards.
2716.0,2717.0, One for the most pathetic game.
2717.0,2718.0, And then another one.
2718.0,2719.0, And then another one.
2719.0,2720.0, The hardest.
2720.0,2721.0, Russian.
2721.0,2722.0, Sure.
2722.0,2723.0, Fucking.
2723.0,2724.0, Whoa.
2724.0,2725.0," Oh, shit."
2725.0,2727.0, Beep that one out.
2727.0,2728.0, Sure.
2728.0,2729.0, Volume.
2729.0,2732.0, I guess Sean's going to have to learn how to do the beat.
2732.0,2734.0, I guess post production is a new post production for this one.
2734.0,2735.0," Thanks, Darren."
2735.0,2736.0, Sorry.
2736.0,2738.0, It's at the very end of least.
2738.0,2739.0, This one that's getting lively.
2739.0,2740.0, We got to just keep going.
2740.0,2741.0, We got to keep going.
2742.0,2743.0," Yeah, let's start the podcast now."
2743.0,2744.0, Get out of the Daren drop that.
2744.0,2745.0, Yeah.
2745.0,2746.0, Yeah.
2746.0,2747.0, We're ready to rock.
2747.0,2749.0, Actually we're ready to stop.
2749.0,2750.0, Okay.
2750.0,2751.0, You can stop there.
2751.0,2752.0, Yeah.
2752.0,2753.0, We got a roll.
2753.0,2756.0, But thank you all for joining again and thank everybody out there for listening.
2756.0,2758.0, And we will see you again next week.
2758.0,2759.0, Bye.
