196.0,200.0," And I'm here with the other four official editors, and they are."
200.0,204.0," Brian Scott, Daring Ladsdon, Sean Elliott, and Sean Moloi."
204.0,206.0, Hi gentlemen. Hello.
206.0,207.0, Hi.
207.0,210.0," Find job on the new, are we coming at an intro?"
210.0,212.0, This time it isn't intro.
212.0,214.0," We call it an intro. You like that shit, Jeffrey?"
214.0,220.0," I like that shit. Last time it was not our official intro, but some people took it as suck."
220.0,223.0," I don't think that was an intro. Well, I guess it wasn't."
223.0,225.0, It comes at the beginning. It's an intro.
225.0,227.0, It's an intro. It's an intro. It's an extra scary thing.

236.0,238.0, We have a lot to talk about.
242.0,246.0, What are we going to talk about?
246.0,249.0," I think you should, don't don't don't don't."
249.0,251.0, And I'm like okay Jeffrey.
251.0,253.0, This is an answer to any tricks.
253.0,255.0," Yeah, you're kind of prompting me."
255.0,257.0," And you're like, uh, with me."
257.0,258.0, I got off the side.
258.0,259.0, I feed him enough.
259.0,261.0, I just kind of burned up for all the meetings.
261.0,262.0, I am.
262.0,263.0, I sat in meetings for two hours.
263.0,264.0, I'm a little burnt.
264.0,265.0, So I'll just read.
265.0,266.0, So does that.
266.0,267.0, I don't have to do any tricks.
267.0,268.0, Yeah.
268.0,269.0," Yes, it does do tricks."
269.0,270.0, Okay.
270.0,272.0, This week on the C G F W.
272.0,274.0, I'm also C T W.
274.0,275.0, Okay.
275.0,278.0, We are going to talk about team fortress 2 Vanguard.
278.0,282.0, Lord of the Rings online and other such topics as.
282.0,286.0," Uh,"
286.0,287.0," Commander,"
287.0,290.0, 3 coming to 360 if we want to slum in that direction.
290.0,293.0," You got this freaking headset you want to talk about, Sean?"
293.0,294.0, What is adding to the track?
294.0,295.0, I are pro.
295.0,296.0, Yeah.
296.0,298.0," You're ducked, dorking out on us a week by the week."
298.0,300.0," I mean, the sense of the further."
300.0,301.0, I'm embracing that.
301.0,303.0," Yeah, we got at least one reader email."
303.0,305.0," Listener email, sorry,"
305.0,306.0, to read.
306.0,308.0, And I suppose that's enough.
308.0,310.0, But let's start off with somebody.
310.0,311.0, The answer to the me talking.
311.0,312.0, Please someone anyone.
312.0,313.0, Remember Mike.
313.0,314.0, Rock the mic.
314.0,316.0," No, uh, so I mean, I think,"
316.0,317.0, I just like start off with games.
317.0,318.0, Been playing lately.
318.0,319.0, Indeed.
319.0,320.0, All right.
320.0,323.0, So I'm going to blast through a couple of these and then we just kind of get into the stuff we will
323.0,324.0, been playing.
324.0,327.0," Uh, so let I'm totally loopy right now because I got no sleep last night."
327.0,328.0, I was I came across.
328.0,331.0," If you haven't checked us out yet, puzzle quest."
331.0,332.0, A puzzle quest.
332.0,333.0, That's a console game.
334.0,336.0, I don't want to start.
336.0,338.0, He also games for Windows.
338.0,339.0, Screw it.
339.0,341.0," Hey, you don't after my Halo experience this weekend."
341.0,342.0, I'm I'm all about this.
342.0,343.0," Oh, yeah."
343.0,344.0," No, but seriously."
344.0,346.0, Let's get back to that.
346.0,347.0," Yeah, we'll I'll get that a minute."
347.0,349.0," But, uh, basically, this game is like,"
349.0,352.0," but jeweled meets fire M1, so it's a it's a it's nice."
352.0,357.0," It's a turned based strategy, puzzle RPG."
357.0,358.0," Yeah, exactly."
358.0,359.0, It's the weirdest thing.
359.0,360.0, It's kind of a...
360.0,361.0, I use the...
361.0,363.0, Puzzles to...
363.0,365.0," Well, basically, you fight monsters and..."
365.0,366.0, Not doing puzzles.
366.0,367.0, By doing puzzles.
367.0,370.0," And it's a shared puzzle board and it's kind of like the jeweled, you swap out gems, and"
370.0,374.0," you create, you know, connect, rows, and you damage the other guy."
374.0,375.0, And you can...
375.0,378.0," It's also as multiplayer, so you can play on someone else."
378.0,380.0, It's a really cool idea.
380.0,381.0, It's definitely worth checking out.
381.0,383.0, So it's a cheap game for like...
383.0,386.0," I mean, you can get it for like 20 bucks, 25 bucks or so for either the DS or the PS."
386.0,389.0," And if you can find it, totally get it."
389.0,390.0, That's...
390.0,392.0," Okay, that was just the quick shout out because I..."
392.0,393.0, Okay.
393.0,395.0," I actually, I was up until five in the morning playing that last night."
395.0,396.0," It's a great name, puzzle quest."
396.0,397.0, Really?
397.0,398.0, It kind of sums it up.
398.0,399.0, Yeah.
399.0,400.0, I have to put your damn shoes on.
400.0,401.0, We went over that.
401.0,402.0, We went over that.
402.0,403.0," Oh, look, these don't have holes."
403.0,405.0, I think they're gonna match well.
405.0,406.0, They're gonna match well.
406.0,407.0, They're gonna match well.
407.0,408.0, They're gonna match well.
408.0,409.0, They're gonna match well.
409.0,410.0, They're gonna match well.
410.0,411.0, They're gonna match well.
411.0,412.0," Yeah, we're not in the brim collazin."
412.0,413.0, We're in the big app.
413.0,414.0, We're gonna match the big game.
414.0,417.0," You know, just stitching up, manding socks."
417.0,418.0, Sowing mama.
418.0,419.0, That would be...
419.0,422.0," Yeah, you need two weak controllers, though, for a sewing game."
422.0,423.0," Yeah, for letting needles."
423.0,424.0," Hey, crocheting needles."
424.0,428.0," What are you doing just being an editor in chief, you should be at the designer?"
428.0,429.0, You're right.
429.0,434.0, I'm gonna leave this magazine to make a wee sewing game.
434.0,435.0, Pro-shape.
435.0,436.0, Good money.
436.0,437.0," Yeah, about it."
437.0,438.0, Are you listening?
438.0,440.0," I'm coming after you, Miyamoto."
440.0,441.0, All right.
441.0,442.0, So an actual PC game?
442.0,443.0, Yeah.
443.0,444.0," Okay, thank you."
444.0,446.0, I figured I'd save it from that self-actor.
446.0,449.0, That's the AGF Physics Card-based game I've been trying to play this.
449.0,450.0, Yeah.
450.0,451.0, And this is on trying.
451.0,453.0," Thank God, it's free because I really wouldn't..."
453.0,454.0, I don't know if I'd pay money for this thing.
454.0,455.0," Oh, boy."
455.0,459.0," Yeah, if they're looking for something, it's gonna really push this physics card."
459.0,461.0, I don't know if this game is it.
461.0,464.0, You know how we sometimes complain how we never get on box quotes.
464.0,465.0, This will make a bet.
465.0,466.0," That was a good one there, right?"
466.0,468.0," Now, I wouldn't pay money for this thing."
468.0,469.0, They're in Gladstone.
469.0,470.0," Feel free to use that one, though."
470.0,471.0," Yeah, they could."
471.0,472.0, You guys can use that player.
472.0,473.0, That's weird.
473.0,474.0, If you got my approval.
474.0,475.0, No.
475.0,476.0, We're in the corporate.
476.0,478.0, So what's the source of the let down?
478.0,480.0, Is it an entire package or a performance issues?
480.0,481.0," Well, it's a lot of things."
481.0,483.0, I'm still in the middle of testing.
483.0,486.0, I've played it on an XP machine and a Vista machine.
486.0,488.0, It's just like slope performance.
488.0,490.0, I did see that over your shoulder.
490.0,491.0, Yeah.
491.0,492.0," And also, it's just kind of like, you know, it's a couple..."
492.0,496.0," Basically, it's a couple multiplayer skirmish maps with bots."
496.0,500.0," Or if you could meet, find other people online that have an AGF card, then you can play against them."
501.0,502.0, Yeah.
502.0,503.0, So what do you do at it?
503.0,505.0, It just like pick up tires and throw them at people.
505.0,510.0," Well, no, I think it's kind of like this, like it's like a, it's almost kind of shadow running, kind of counter strike kind of vibe to it."
510.0,512.0, So like you have three different types of classes.
512.0,514.0, One is like black ops.
514.0,518.0," You have some like psychic, you know, psychic abilities, tell kids stuff like that."
518.0,520.0, And you also can use weapons and vehicles.
520.0,524.0, And then there's another one that's straight up weaponry and there's another guy who's straight up psychic powers.
524.0,529.0, And so basically it's like all about manipulating all this stuff and blowing up all this crap in the environment.
529.0,534.0," It's supposed to be this huge tech that would have show off what a card can do, but it's just..."
534.0,537.0," I don't know, I feel like the gameplay isn't fully there."
537.0,539.0, It was a function as a tech demo at least.
539.0,542.0," Like, you're impressed by the physics in this physics game."
542.0,543.0," Well, it is kind of cool."
543.0,548.0," You see like a shit load of boxes just flying off, you know, flying out and you can throw a box of somebody and kill them."
548.0,551.0, But I throw a box of people without a card.
551.0,552.0, Exactly.
552.0,556.0," I mean, like I could do that with a gravity gun and half-light."
556.0,557.0, But it's more...
557.0,564.0," I mean, I throwing a hell of a lot more boxes, but overall what I saw, the level design reminded me of what was the guys that made"
564.0,567.0," Pryan, they made that other game that was strictly death match."
567.0,568.0, Warpath.
568.0,569.0, Warpath.
569.0,573.0," It reminded me of something like that, which is to say a knockoff on real tournament."
573.0,580.0," So if you take an uninspired, unreal tournament map and basically add your imitation of it and add a whole lot of boxes."
580.0,585.0," I mean, like the vehicle idea and stuff, I mean, there's vehicles that's basically like it looked like you're saying."
585.0,589.0," If you play the psychic character, then that becomes your equalizer, that becomes your vehicle."
589.0,599.0," But surprisingly, I mean, if you had a physics card, it's like you think the out of counted just how many boxes it took before they started bringing their bring in their whole process or to a grinding halt."
599.0,602.0, Because the boxes were like moving slowly.
602.0,604.0, In the same way when you get physics lag and you have to...
604.0,605.0, And I was trying...
605.0,607.0," And I was trying this at different resolutions, too."
607.0,610.0," It wasn't like I was just trying to max this out of 25, 60 by 1600."
610.0,612.0," Yeah, you did have it really crank though."
612.0,614.0, I'm not just being...
614.0,616.0," You know, just being fizzacious about it."
616.0,622.0, But I really don't get what these cards are supposed to actually add to the mix.
622.0,626.0," Well, the thing is the potential was there for what they could do, but I think they're..."
626.0,627.0, What could they do?
627.0,629.0," I mean, it's kind of like..."
629.0,631.0, I'm trying to think about that.
631.0,633.0," Here's the thing, what could add that would be cool."
633.0,634.0, They could add a whole lot more...
634.0,641.0," I mean, basically we know it's a given that physics will continue to be a very central part of next generation games and encouraging it."
641.0,649.0," So they basically take the strain off your graphics card so that it's able to emphasize, you know, and do all the other stuff that it's doing."
649.0,651.0, And let this handle the physics.
651.0,656.0," Any randomized idea could be like, I mean, if you're playing a splitter cell type thing,"
656.0,663.0," and every individual branch is breaking and falls over in certain ways so that when you're looking around and you're trying to track someone else for say,"
663.0,666.0," you'd be able to see in real time like, oh, these branches are broken."
666.0,673.0," These branches are broken, not because they swapped out the JPEG of a bush of a plant into a broken model, but because they actually..."
673.0,674.0," I mean, that's a quick idea."
674.0,675.0, That's a quick idea.
675.0,676.0, Or just the other way.
676.0,681.0," I mean, imagine like instead of a speed tree in oblivion, every, you know, leaves are falling off,"
681.0,684.0, and they're actual physics leaves that can fall and land on your shoulder or...
684.0,685.0, But see that shit I don't care about.
685.0,686.0, It doesn't add...
686.0,688.0, But it adds a specific edge for gameplay.
688.0,693.0," Yeah, it's a gameplay stuff that's the tricky part because everyone's playing the half of the physics."
693.0,694.0, That's exactly it.
694.0,700.0, And that's why the self-back game was so hinging upon the fact that it used really show off how it could really affect the gameplay in a smart way.
700.0,701.0, Right.
701.0,705.0," I mean, the analogy, like, when I started writing about this, when I first started writing about this a long time ago,"
705.0,710.0," the first thing that popped in my head was like, and this is around the time that Battlefield Vietnam was kind of out."
710.0,714.0," And I was thinking, wow, when you become a cool, if you're, you're, you're, you're, you're crouching and like, you know,"
714.0,720.0," crawling through a field and like, the grass, the blades of grass part and kind of give away your position if you don't go slow enough."
720.0,721.0, Right.
721.0,722.0, Right.
722.0,723.0, But it's not there.
723.0,728.0," Or, I mean, even in a simplistic gratification sense is say if you're playing Christ, it's something you're shooting up a vehicle."
728.0,733.0," And you want to see not just, okay, the wheels are scripted to fall off the door comes off,"
733.0,738.0," but the thing will actually break up and every piece that comes off, our flight game, you're shooting up with Canon and other plane."
738.0,743.0, And every little bit of of of Canvas and stuff that comes off the plane will actually be physical.
743.0,749.0," So again, like, I mean, someone maybe could take the idea and say, hey, I've always had this idea, like, you know,"
749.0,755.0," catamar, you're something, but it ultimately, I've been prevented from doing it because the physics demands are so intense."
755.0,759.0," I mean, I'm sure there's something that you could come up with that would use it."
759.0,764.0," But the thing it, I haven't changed the dawn in my appreciation for the need for advanced physics,"
764.0,768.0, but the only thing that's changed between when you first wrote about it now is multiple processes.
768.0,769.0, That's exactly it.
769.0,775.0," And it's like, if it's a no brainer that we're, the games we use are going to continue to perform physics operations, calculations,"
775.0,781.0," and the more that they perform, the easier it is going to be for developers to deliver the visions that they want to deliver."
781.0,784.0, It's just a matter of what the delivery system is going to be.
784.0,787.0, Is it going to be this card or is it going to be handled through your process?
787.0,792.0," Well, I think the real trick for the, for a geos early on, maybe it's like, they had to deliver on this promise quicker,"
792.0,796.0," and they needed to make sure that it was like, you know, it's such like a no brainer thing that it would be like,"
796.0,800.0," imagine like you buy a computer and it's not a car, it's built onto the motherboard."
801.0,805.0," And if it got to that kind of level of saturation, then yeah, it would make sense."
805.0,812.0," But the thing is it's such a limited audience right now that there's, and really they're banking on the game to show off what it can do."
812.0,820.0," So there's this game which I don't really see is I mean, like, what initially look cool when I saw it a year, two years ago, is pretty cool."
820.0,823.0, Maybe what net devils working on next could do something.
823.0,824.0, I don't know.
825.0,828.0, And then the last hope is that this is built into the Unreal 3 engine.
828.0,832.0," So if something cools down with the Unreal 3 engine in some game, great."
832.0,834.0," Otherwise, this should end the water."
834.0,839.0," It comes up over and over again, and it's actually a perfect segue for me talking about track IR because it's similar."
839.0,844.0, It's another piece of hardware that you have to buy a change of functionality of games.
844.0,846.0," And but so for this, it's just the usual thing."
846.0,847.0," I mean, you want to sell this product."
847.0,853.0," You have to have some killer application for it, but no one's making a killer application for your product unless you've sold it."
853.0,854.0, So you just dead in the water.
854.0,868.0," And in the same way in console and you say, if you're trying to release like the 3Dx for say, or something, if you're trying any major piece of hardware that you want to release after launch is basically going to be dead in the water."
868.0,876.0," I mean, there are a bit of few exceptions, you know, but like, I mean, quite a few people, I toys and stuff, but you can never really, if you don't put it in the box of a console when you ship it, you can't expect everyone to get it."
876.0,880.0," And it's the same problem here, and that, you know, basically for the reasons I just said,"
881.0,895.0," because so going back to the track, I are, it's, it's basically a piece of motion, you know, motion detection equipment and you put on a visor or now even more conveniently, you basically just clip this thing on the side of your headset."
895.0,897.0, What did the visor look like?
897.0,899.0," It's actually just a golf visor, something."
899.0,905.0," It's not as gimp that I can sex it up, and maybe people laugh by talking about how it was colored like a hot dog on a stick hat or something."
905.0,907.0," But it's just like, it's just about to do it."
907.0,913.0," I remember the first time that I saw some of that coming demo that, who was playing a GTR, because that game, that's one of the games it has."
913.0,915.0, GTR is the game.
915.0,916.0, And it's built in support.
916.0,922.0," So the guy comes in, he's actually demoing the game, and he brings in his head is track IR thing and like back then, they didn't have the visors yet."
922.0,924.0," They had these little like silver stickers, you'd put on."
924.0,925.0," Yeah, you put it on your head."
925.0,933.0," So yeah, he put a little silver dot as for like a techno, a techno Hindu and he's like, that's the old tech, the new tech now on the visor."
933.0,936.0, It relies on three points and the same thing with the clip on the side of your head.
936.0,946.0," Really, the fact that if you've already got a headset with the microphone boom on, you're not going to look like that much more of a like a douche by putting this other thing on the side."
946.0,948.0, It's basically these three prongs.
948.0,951.0," So what it does now, three points is it just detects more subtle movement."
951.0,956.0," And then why does anyone care about this in IL2, which I play in the same as GTR?"
956.0,960.0," It gives you, it basically translates, you know, your head movements into game movements."
960.0,965.0," Now, I've talked about this before, and I've talked about it again now, because now that I have it, it's, if it sounds slightly interesting,"
965.0,970.0," it's actually better and more fun than it sounds. I mean, it completely blew me away."
970.0,975.0, It's such an organic solution when I fly in IL2 to dog fighting and stuff.
975.0,981.0," I mean, just keeping another plane in my line of sight and maneuvering my plane and still like looking around and looking up."
981.0,988.0," But it's just so much fun. I mean, when you're playing it, you quickly, you don't even think about it. You don't fight it. You don't say, okay, let me try to coordinate."
988.0,990.0, It's not like patting your stomach and rubbing your head.
990.0,995.0," It's just do it. What's happened earlier? Like, you're flying that way and all of a sudden your girlfriend goes, hey, Sean,"
995.0,997.0, I think you turn around with all you whether you're head.
997.0,999.0, Is your plane going to crash?
999.0,1003.0," No, it's just going to stop after. Like, I mean, you're looking at me, people listening can't tell."
1003.0,1007.0," But like, if I move like this much, that's like the equivalent of me looking, so it's about three."
1007.0,1008.0, So it's like 35 degrees.
1008.0,1015.0," But you quickly, your mind very quickly understands the extent of read on the device."
1015.0,1022.0," And so you're not like, oh, you don't have to over undercrect it. You just get it. It's just like really intuitive and spank. You just know just how much to do it."
1022.0,1027.0," It's great in that game. Now to the point where I like, I don't even want to play that game without that."
1027.0,1031.0," It's that, I mean, I'm not lying. Like, here's the thing. I have to, so for,"
1031.0,1039.0," We're disclosure, I did, they said, they heard me talking about wanting this thing and on the podcast and they emailed me and said, hey, can I send it to you?"
1039.0,1042.0," So I want to get that out there. Like, I'm not in case I sound like a show for this thing."
1042.0,1047.0," I did get it for free and it is expensive. That's, and they gave you 50 bucks to them."
1047.0,1052.0," No, they did. And I said, hey, like, I'll take it. I have no guarantees."
1052.0,1056.0," I mean, I might think it's a piece of overrated trash. I mean, not over price trash."
1056.0,1058.0," How much is it? 100,000 bucks, right?"
1058.0,1064.0," Yeah, it is. So it's definitely expensive. The other thing is, like, I could say about it is that, like, so I was genuinely impressed."
1064.0,1069.0," You know, I mean, you have to like, you can decide if you want to be skeptical or believe me, but I like it."
1069.0,1073.0," And of course, I'm talking about for just experience with one game so far."
1073.0,1080.0," And it's also, it doesn't have that that chintzy feel that a lot of, you know, it's not a major interface manufacturer, what yet,"
1080.0,1087.0," but it doesn't, it doesn't feel like it came out of someone's garage at this point. Maybe earlier iterations did, but it was always, it was always pretty sturdy."
1087.0,1093.0," Okay. So other things, arm to salt, which is now called arma is out and use it."
1093.0,1103.0," And so not only does it look left, right, and up and down, it has, you know, role and coming forward and backward, you know, to the in relation to your computer monitor."
1103.0,1114.0," So what this means in arm to salt is that if you want, instead of having to mouse to or whatever to sight down your weapons or if you're on a turret and you want to like, you know, sight down if it's power something, you just lean forward a little bit."
1114.0,1132.0," Obviously, you're not touching your nose to your monitor. Do you lean forward a little bit and that will handle that furthermore, your your head can be moved independently of your body, which means that say if you want to go up to a corner and you want to point your gun, you know, because your head's able to move quicker than your body and still stay accurate."
1132.0,1139.0, You could put your gun and point on a general area where you expect to see and then look over your left shoulder with your head and see what's behind you or whatever.
1139.0,1154.0," It might not make you the best player or anything. It's not going to confer advantage on you that way in the way it doesn't aisle to, but my guess and my friend, Rory, who tried it says, it does what it does and that it wants to immerse you in the game and you feel more part of the game that you're playing."
1154.0,1167.0," So it's a thing. And then finally, yet again in that game, air of flying in vehicles and stuff works the same as it would nile to you. So if you're in a helicopter, you have door gunners and you want to make sure that you actually have them lined up where they're able to hit a target that you want them to hit."
1167.0,1175.0," You can just look to your left as you're flying without going screwball. And you can do that in battlefield, but you have to, you know, the way it's set up now, you hit shift or control, whatever you have."
1175.0,1183.0," And look, but then you can no longer control the plane. This way you still have control. So if you wanted to go down and all the while looking left out the window, you could do that."
1183.0,1189.0," And I mean, more and more game, the trick is to get more and more games to support it."
1190.0,1199.0," But here, it's not such a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's like restructuring the entire game from the ground up. It could be. But, and surprisingly, they have quite a few companies on board."
1199.0,1206.0, The guy I talked to that gave me the thing was saying how they're really interested in speaking with smaller game developers.
1206.0,1212.0," So like if you're making, you know, quick puzzle games and things, I mean, just different ways about that."
1213.0,1220.0," So it's pretty damn expensive, though. It's definitely expensive. It's not for, it's for people with the Swiss winkins."
1220.0,1225.0, But people who fly flight sims are used to spending a lot of money on these peripherals. And you need to get them.
1225.0,1227.0," Yeah, super, super, super immersive experience."
1227.0,1232.0," Actually, before we get to far off topic, I would anyone ask one question because I'm thinking about this for armor."
1232.0,1238.0," So can you like post, like, so you're going to post up on a wall. Can you like use your head, like, kind of peek around the corner? Is that how that works?"
1238.0,1243.0," That would be interesting because I know it does register you going forward, but in there, since it puts you up to your sights, I'm guessing no."
1243.0,1256.0," I know they could if they wanted because in Microsoft Flight Sim, which has the six degrees of motion tracking instead of the four like I'll two, you can actually duck down and look like so if you're looking at your instrument panel."
1256.0,1266.0," And you wanted to look like under it. You actually like duck down and look up and you're like, your view on the monitors doing the same or if you wanted to like kind of kind of stand up and your seat, look out over your dashboard."
1266.0,1277.0," That would work. So so clearly, it's got, it's got the ability to do that if they wanted to put that in that would kind of be interesting, you know, you see people peeking their heads out instead of hitting like lean left lead right. You see some fool actually pop his head out."
1277.0,1283.0," That's exactly what I'm thinking. I mean, that's an, that's an intuitive control that like, you know, people are so used to in real life."
1283.0,1291.0," And the final good thing I'll say about it is that I was expecting, you know, not only just being, you know, some, some smaller company, but that it would just be."
1291.0,1298.0," And in, you know, again, not only from an engineering standpoint, but from a software standpoint, and here's the good news is like, it puts an icon on your desktop."
1298.0,1306.0," You just double click it, open it up and then whenever you open a game, the light on your sensor will turn blue if it supports it and you don't have to do anything else."
1306.0,1315.0," So you don't have to even go into your controls and change anything. You just once once you've had the track, I kind of, prior to opening your game, you're automatically configured, good and go."
1315.0,1319.0," And it's easy. And does it, but is it possible to map out those commands from them?"
1319.0,1324.0," Yeah, you can, you can go and do all that if that you can take as much as you want. Yeah."
1324.0,1328.0," Cool. So that's, that's the end of my run on that, but I'm pretty impressed with the commercial."
1328.0,1331.0, I like that's a testimonial. This is a testimonial.
1331.0,1333.0, This episode brought to you by track.
1333.0,1341.0," But it, it's fun. I didn't want to talk about it because it wasn't here just because like, you know, if it was Nintendo or something, the kids would be like,"
1341.0,1346.0," well, I, I don't, I feel to understand how you don't see that this is revolution. Anything less than a revolution."
1346.0,1352.0," But I mean, I mean, I don't, no, not to that extent, but it's like, I think it's just because it's PC. People aren't going to get hyped about it."
1352.0,1354.0," Yeah, you know, and it's expensive."
1354.0,1357.0," Well, exactly. It's the price of entry. It's always going to be the issue there."
1357.0,1359.0, Yeah. I hate.
1359.0,1361.0, I don't have a hundred bucks to spare.
1361.0,1363.0, I don't either.
1363.0,1367.0," So anyone else want to jump in before we get to team fortress, too?"
1367.0,1368.0, No.
1368.0,1369.0, Where we're going to hit the loader.
1370.0,1371.0, You got to get any load of the rings.
1371.0,1372.0, A loader.
1372.0,1373.0, Loader.
1373.0,1377.0," Yeah. I played a, a bungload of, of loader this weekend."
1377.0,1379.0," I, I think that's how you measure."
1379.0,1380.0, Is that supposed to play in that game?
1380.0,1382.0, Yeah. It's going to be to cube it by the bungload.
1382.0,1384.0," Uh, I don't know."
1384.0,1385.0, I should.
1385.0,1386.0, That is actually a great game.
1386.0,1388.0," I'm, I'm sorry."
1388.0,1390.0," No, I'm having a lot of fun."
1390.0,1391.0, Lot of fun. I'm up.
1391.0,1392.0, Level 14 now.
1392.0,1393.0, Blubbo.
1393.0,1396.0, The Hobbit Guardian is now level 14.
1396.0,1397.0, Okay.
1397.0,1398.0, Okay.
1399.0,1402.0," And I'm finding I called out on our forms, though, by the way."
1402.0,1406.0," What? The dick writers, the lions, like, is when we mentioned that you guys are playing on Brandy."
1406.0,1407.0," The writers, lions?"
1407.0,1410.0," Because you guys are like playing on the Brandy, wild server."
1410.0,1411.0, Yeah.
1411.0,1414.0," And the other, there was an already extended thread to get people to play."
1414.0,1416.0, And they were on another server.
1416.0,1419.0," And they were like, they posted to rally."
1419.0,1420.0, Yeah.
1420.0,1421.0," Friends, like, hey, come on in play with us."
1421.0,1423.0," But now everyone's like, no, we're going to Brandy, wine."
1423.0,1424.0, What?
1424.0,1425.0, Cause I'm on there.
1425.0,1426.0, Yeah.
1426.0,1429.0," I said, I would be on there once I get this piece of weight."
1429.0,1430.0, This is what you're doing.
1430.0,1431.0, Where's the end?
1431.0,1432.0," You're not going to play it, are you?"
1432.0,1433.0, I'm going to play it.
1433.0,1434.0, Just so you might not.
1434.0,1437.0," Even if I'm going to get, I'm going to buy a lure of the rings novel."
1437.0,1440.0," So I can, I'm going to go in and try to join people's parties."
1440.0,1441.0, And then I'll open up.
1441.0,1442.0," No, I won't talk."
1442.0,1443.0, I'm not going to join their fellowship.
1443.0,1444.0, And I won't talk.
1444.0,1446.0," But then, like, after we're in the middle of a thing,"
1446.0,1449.0," Okay, maybe I'll just be like the guy that could play the loot."
1449.0,1452.0," But I won't bring any, uh, I won't bring any weapons or anything."
1452.0,1453.0, I'm just going to bring a go and naked.
1453.0,1455.0, And then I'll tell you your loot.
1456.0,1457.0, I'm going to play it.
1457.0,1458.0, So they won't know.
1458.0,1460.0," They'll just, like, okay, it's just the quiet guy, whatever."
1460.0,1462.0," And then, like, I'll just start talking."
1462.0,1465.0," I'll just start reading and like, like, some dumb voice, uh, some of the passages from"
1465.0,1466.0, the Lord of the Rings.
1466.0,1468.0," Just like, just like, ask him, you know, just like,"
1468.0,1469.0, and bomb a deal stuff.
1469.0,1470.0," Oh, really get it."
1470.0,1472.0, Maybe you can play 10 or sex instead.
1472.0,1474.0, Do they have it?
1474.0,1475.0, Skin flute.
1475.0,1476.0, What is that?
1476.0,1477.0," Yeah, central."
1477.0,1478.0, Okay.
1478.0,1480.0," Okay, you're going to play your time."
1480.0,1482.0, You're going to play the sixth grade.
1482.0,1484.0," Like, you'd have played, uh, essential sex."
1484.0,1485.0," Like, okay, maybe there's a joke here."
1485.0,1486.0, I'll pretend to laugh.
1486.0,1490.0," But you're really saying, dude, you could suck dick when you're in that game."
1490.0,1494.0," Oh, yeah, pretty fun, man."
1494.0,1495.0," Oh, I'm sorry."
1495.0,1497.0, This is already.
1497.0,1500.0, That was so sophisticated.
1500.0,1501.0," Yeah, thank you, I love you."
1501.0,1506.0, I'm the oldest one here.
1506.0,1507.0, Yeah.
1507.0,1509.0, I'm a sense of humor.
1509.0,1511.0," Okay, so I'm a level 14."
1512.0,1513.0, So I'm all 14.
1513.0,1514.0, I've been playing a lot.
1514.0,1517.0," I, uh, I am really liking it."
1517.0,1520.0, I'm very impressed by what turbine did here.
1520.0,1525.0, I think they learned a lot of lessons over the years with their MMOs and watching.
1525.0,1529.0," Wow, obviously, and I, it feels very balanced."
1529.0,1534.0," And, and what I'm really enjoying, and so I love a lot now is, uh, the traits you get."
1534.0,1536.0," Have you gotten far enough to get a trait yet, John?"
1536.0,1538.0," Um, I don't think so."
1538.0,1540.0, I've gotten the little indicator that tells me.
1540.0,1543.0, I'm on my way to earning a trait a little care that fills up.
1543.0,1548.0," Yeah, you know how we are sort of complaining about how there's not really, like, much, like, there's no skill trees to follow."
1548.0,1554.0," So there's no real choices to be made there, but the, but the choices start coming in these traits, because"
1554.0,1561.0," because you only get a couple slots, the slots open up more as you lot a lot, but at the beginning, you only have one in them too."
1561.0,1564.0, But you're going to have more traits than there are slots.
1564.0,1567.0," And so you need to, um, and you have to pay to fill the slots."
1567.0,1572.0," So you'll get, uh, empathy which will add plus one to your morale or whatever it is."
1572.0,1576.0," And you, you'll swap these out as, you know, as situations arise."
1576.0,1581.0," So you can, um, or you're like, only a couple at a time or have you going to equip a couple of time, but then to, like,"
1581.0,1584.0," respect you have to go pay or to, uh, let's just, uh, titles."
1584.0,1586.0," Okay, so I was, no, no, no, this is the traits."
1586.0,1592.0," The titles are just like, you know, right now I'm blah, blah, protector of the shire, because I, I killed some,"
1592.0,1595.0," I did so many quests, I think, or whatever, protector ended the shire."
1595.0,1598.0," Yeah, I, right, I protected right at the shop."
1598.0,1600.0, So how are these traits different?
1600.0,1603.0," And like, I was king of the cardboard city."
1603.0,1605.0, So I gave a homeless one.
1605.0,1609.0," There's a whole lot of different, the fact that you can be like champion, pie eater."
1609.0,1612.0," And if you like win a pie eating contest, that's what you want to eat."
1612.0,1613.0," Well, you can eat pie in that game?"
1613.0,1615.0," Yes, you can. Yes, sir."
1615.0,1616.0, You get it.
1616.0,1617.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1617.0,1620.0," You can, you can move and write on from that."
1620.0,1622.0, You can ask for it.
1622.0,1625.0," It says the guy who says, give a flute five minutes ago."
1625.0,1628.0," You can also type slash smoke, then you're smoking a pipe."
1628.0,1632.0," Slash pizza, not a whole not many games, no size pizza."
1632.0,1637.0," Uh, the only big problem having with the game is is there is a whole lot of the folks in chat, at least"
1637.0,1642.0," No, I mean, why me today have slash, uh, Lord of the Rings, shape, chicken nuggets."
1642.0,1645.0," So, there are chickens in the game."
1645.0,1646.0, I don't want nugget.
1646.0,1652.0," And me, Cobbett, there's chickens running around with this kind of weird, because I don't remember chickens in the, in the Tolkin books, you know,"
1652.0,1654.0, Is there a place they can take into the litter?
1654.0,1656.0, There's no question kilch chickens.
1656.0,1657.0, Actually I haven't tried to kill a chicken.
1657.0,1658.0, I think I will.
1658.0,1659.0, Next time I get on.
1659.0,1661.0, If I get an XP for that.
1661.0,1662.0, Yeah.
1662.0,1663.0," Just don't say, okay, there might."
1663.0,1665.0," I'm not going to say it was like, choking chicken."
1665.0,1666.0," Yeah, there we go."
1666.0,1667.0, There's always waiting for that.
1667.0,1670.0," Oh, I love their, they're poor."
1672.0,1673.0, Wow.
1673.0,1675.0, You're not really.
1675.0,1677.0, I'm not really.
1677.0,1680.0," Okay, so, uh, what am I trying to say here?"
1680.0,1685.0," Uh, oh, about the, uh, the traits, the traits, but then also the, the, the other players,"
1685.0,1690.0," There's, there's just an incredible amount of, of sincere chat going on that just,"
1690.0,1693.0," It just brings out that the bad person in me, you know?"
1693.0,1697.0," There's a lot of people, I guess, who have been waiting a long time to be in middle,"
1697.0,1700.0, Earth and pretend they're really in middle or just a lot of chat.
1700.0,1703.0," Like, like, a lot of chat there's like people saying number two in Europe right now."
1703.0,1704.0, Is it?
1704.0,1705.0, Yeah.
1705.0,1708.0," Maybe it's the Europeans who are doing this sincere error, the Lord of the Rings chat."
1708.0,1709.0, What do you mean sincere?
1709.0,1716.0," Like, like, like, like, like, like, like it's a may-find night out tonight like when the sun goes down in the game,"
1716.0,1717.0," You know, how do you spell, might you?"
1717.0,1720.0," Yeah, might you was like a, an e after the y."
1720.0,1724.0," Just pickable, and then someone going, I it is, lad back and chat."
1724.0,1727.0," I'm like, fuck I'm not on the roll, Planks server."
1727.0,1730.2, Man is there actually a role playing server. This is Killshick.
1730.2,1731.2, Wush off a lot.
1731.84,1732.0, Great.
1732.0,1732.8, Wush off.
1732.8,1733.2, Yeah.
1733.2,1736.4, And I was in a group last night with there were like four Hobbits.
1736.4,1737.2, I was one of them.
1737.2,1738.6," Sorry, a fellowship not a group."
1739.0,1740.8, There are other like four Hobbits.
1740.8,1742.2, You're just coming to the end of that.
1742.2,1744.6," And one of the guys, one of the Hobbits kept like,"
1744.6,1746.8, like we're like just trying to kill Goblins.
1746.8,1747.2, Okay.
1747.2,1748.0, That's the quest.
1748.0,1749.6, It was like kill however many Goblins.
1749.6,1754.4, And then you had to go get the thing the umbrella that was hiding at the end of the Goblin camp.
1754.4,1756.0, And one guy kept going.
1756.0,1757.0, I know.
1757.0,1758.0, It was an umbrella.
1758.0,1759.0," Clearly, forever."
1759.0,1760.0, You would copy a lure to the rings for free.
1761.0,1763.0, I am likely reverse psychology.
1763.0,1764.0," No, I'm liking it."
1764.0,1768.0," But this one guy in the fellowship kept like saying like, you know,"
1768.0,1773.0," we, we Hobbits should rest and have another breakfast before we continue venturing."
1773.0,1774.0, And then a smiley face.
1774.0,1777.0, It was like shut the fuck up and kill the Goblins.
1777.0,1780.0, There's no second breakfast in this game.
1780.0,1781.0, You need to make it.
1781.0,1785.0, You can get a whole whip up your own fellowship of totes on a shirt.
1785.0,1786.0, You can't do that.
1786.0,1787.0, You can't do that.
1787.0,1788.0, You're right.
1788.0,1806.0," And then some other guy was like actually on their complaining about like game reviewers, which I thought was funny."
1806.0,1807.0, Not somebody in the fellowship.
1807.0,1813.0," He was like saying like, the sparagingly he was saying, well, game reviewers probably aren't going to really like this."
1813.0,1815.0, But the kiddies are viewing this game.
1815.0,1819.0," I'm going to like this game because they're used to, they're used to a baby game like wow."
1819.0,1820.0, This one guy.
1820.0,1822.0," This is like, hi, for the guess what?"
1822.0,1825.0, This game is wow with a different skin.
1825.0,1826.0," Yeah, one more on."
1826.0,1828.0, This is not the more sophisticated.
1828.0,1829.0, Wow.
1829.0,1830.0, This is just wow with a Lord of the Rings license.
1830.0,1831.0, There's a equivalent of that.
1831.0,1834.0, I'm sure there's a equivalent of that every genre.
1834.0,1835.0, I'm just asked.
1835.0,1836.0, Yeah.
1836.0,1838.0, All an equivalent to that exists in every genre.
1838.0,1839.0, I'm sure.
1839.0,1842.0, And equivalent in shooters is the so-called tactical shooter.
1842.0,1847.0," Basically, if you play a game that sucks in the only difference between it and say like counter strike is that the movement speed."
1847.0,1849.0, This is Lord and Halo.
1849.0,1850.0, Uh-huh.
1850.0,1851.0, Then they're like the same thing.
1851.0,1852.0," Oh, yeah."
1852.0,1854.0, Those pleaps just wouldn't understand.
1854.0,1860.0," Basically, yeah, you walk like you just got out of like the urgent care care ward and it's tactical."
1860.0,1863.0, It's a little bit of a shit.
1863.0,1864.0, It's a little bit of a shit.
1864.0,1865.0, I'll hold you like.
1865.0,1868.0," If they were talking about the original rainbow six, is where you actually had to control AI squads and"
1868.0,1870.0, tactically tell them where to go and what ordered to do it in.
1871.0,1872.0, That'd be a little different.
1872.0,1875.0," Well, yeah, I'm not saying that like tactical game doesn't exist."
1875.0,1876.0, I know that like it's just funny.
1876.0,1881.0," That's the equivalent of here like that in the same way that Lord of the, it's not saying that a hardcore MMO doesn't exist."
1881.0,1882.0, Exactly.
1882.0,1884.0," It's not fucking Lord of the Rings online, you know."
1884.0,1891.0," Anyway, the same guy who was like talking about us, we have it sees at one point he said he was sorry that that wasn't voice chat."
1891.0,1894.0," I was like, yeah, I thought there is."
1894.0,1898.0," Well, that well, we didn't, I don't know if there is or not, but we didn't have it."
1898.0,1899.0, We're on the street.
1899.0,1900.0, There is.
1900.0,1902.0," Maybe there is, but I sure don't want to listen to that guy."
1902.0,1906.0," What am I supposed to like type token passages and texting, expect that to be fun?"
1906.0,1908.0," Oh, that's what, oh yeah, you are."
1908.0,1910.0, All my plans to play with the spelling more.
1910.0,1912.0, Revolve around the voice over IP.
1912.0,1914.0," Oh, so no, that you heard my that be there."
1914.0,1915.0, Who don't want to play with.
1915.0,1916.0," No, I know it's there."
1916.0,1917.0, Other people were saying.
1917.0,1920.0, I read the sketch just hearing some dude like.
1920.0,1922.0, Let's have second breakfast.
1922.0,1923.0, Yeah.
1923.0,1927.0," That's not ish one like, you know, like if you're or if you're in team, because I know you guys play"
1927.0,1928.0, with him.
1928.0,1930.0," I don't know how in team speaking, you get like a lot of people you don't know in."
1930.0,1935.0," What's in a while, something starts mouth and often you have to, everyone kind of like alt tabs and looks to see who's lights flashing."
1935.0,1937.0, Like I'm saying that shit.
1937.0,1938.0, Why don't you stop?
1938.0,1939.0, We use video.
1939.0,1940.0, I want to be that dude.
1940.0,1943.0, I want to do voice chat for any game.
1943.0,1945.0, Then I don't want to hear people talking.
1945.0,1946.0, Yeah.
1946.0,1948.0, I just break your illusion.
1948.0,1949.0, It will.
1949.0,1950.0, Yeah.
1950.0,1956.0," I don't want to be like, what if, you know, it's hard enough in a while like taking, I don't like taking orders of people in a game."
1956.0,1959.0," But I don't want to find out it's like some like 10 year old kid, you know."
1959.0,1960.0, You're really hippy.
1960.0,1961.0, You're really hippy.
1961.0,1962.0, You're really hippy.
1962.0,1964.0," Folk a singer energy on the, on the gap."
1964.0,1965.0, Yeah.
1965.0,1966.0, I can't even do.
1966.0,1967.0, You and Sean could play together.
1967.0,1971.0," You haven't even, you probably haven't even run into one another or not on the same server."
1971.0,1972.0, Yeah.
1972.0,1973.0, And that's the same way.
1973.0,1975.0, Same way we've never once had a staff barbecue.
1975.0,1976.0, Yeah.
1976.0,1977.0, It was well.
1977.0,1978.0, Yeah.
1978.0,1979.0, Like that.
1979.0,1980.0, You're having an end of staff bar.
1980.0,1981.0, Because everybody's Sean's house.
1981.0,1982.0," We have, we have lunch together."
1982.0,1984.0, You can at least play low to the rings together.
1984.0,1985.0, Hey.
1985.0,1987.0, We've been in the Lord of the Rings together.
1987.0,1988.0, Let's make a fair.
1988.0,1989.0, Sure.
1989.0,1991.0, Let's make a fair play.
1991.0,1994.0," I'm not even not, I just got out of the new piece of it."
1994.0,1996.0, And so which one I use?
1996.0,1997.0," Well, are you human?"
1997.0,1998.0," The human, yeah."
1998.0,1999.0, Okay.
1999.0,2001.0, Like the world changing event.
2001.0,2002.0, Yeah.
2002.0,2004.0, I am like in the game though.
2004.0,2005.0, I am.
2005.0,2006.0, Did you do that model 14?
2006.0,2007.0, Did you do the monster thing yet?
2007.0,2009.0," Nah, I still haven't made it over there yet."
2009.0,2011.0, I'm still enjoying being a hobbit.
2011.0,2013.0, Because I get too breakfast.
2014.0,2016.0, So I think that's pretty great.
2016.0,2017.0, I'm sick of hearing about this.
2017.0,2018.0, Alright.
2018.0,2019.0, Yeah.
2019.0,2020.0," Well, take a break."
2020.0,2021.0, I will take a break.
2021.0,2023.0, I will come back with some talk about team portraits.
2023.0,2024.0, Okay.
2024.0,2026.0, Because that's like a preview.
2026.0,2027.0," Actually, it's not playing."
2027.0,2028.0, It's like my game's this time.
2028.0,2029.0, Holy sh.
2029.0,2030.0, That happened.
2030.0,2031.0, I don't know.
2031.0,2032.0, We got plenty of time.
2032.0,2033.0, It's our good.
2033.0,2034.0, Okay.
2034.0,2035.0, We'll be back.
2040.0,2041.0," Oh, hello."
2041.0,2042.0, I didn't see there.
2042.0,2049.0," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live, the weekly podcast from the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly, along with the wonderful sounds of."
2049.0,2061.0," EGM live comes action packed with special guests, late breaking news, fanboy bait and commentary behind the scenes tales of office Tom Follery and trivia contest with fan tabulous prizes."
2061.0,2066.0, Download it now at EGMlive.1up.com or subscribe to it through iTunes.
2066.0,2070.0," EGM Live is part of the one-up radio network, tip and zip-divist offices and San Francisco."
2070.0,2074.0, It is not actually live and contest prizes are not guaranteed to be fan tabulous.
2074.0,2075.0, We're back.
2075.0,2076.0, Hi.
2076.0,2077.0," Hi, my team portraits."
2077.0,2078.0, Team portraits too.
2078.0,2079.0, Team portraits too.
2079.0,2080.0, Actually in.
2080.0,2083.0, I'm going to plug for one moment.
2083.0,2084.0, Our brand new issue.
2084.0,2086.0, Just going to subscribers right now.
2086.0,2089.0," It's got, yeah, it's got World Warcraft on the cover."
2089.0,2090.0, Again.
2090.0,2093.0, But we have a team fortress to article in there.
2093.0,2095.0, So check it out on the name stand.
2095.0,2098.0, I do want to say right before we came down here.
2098.0,2104.0," You know, when the new issue comes in to the office, I get this miniscule box with like eight copies."
2104.0,2106.0, So we each get one.
2106.0,2110.0," And one of them, I went into the men's room right before we came down here."
2110.0,2114.0, We know who was because when I have freaking precious issues sitting in the men's room like all wet.
2114.0,2115.0," Yes, all the stuff."
2115.0,2116.0," Yeah, all the stuff."
2116.0,2117.0, I have a soggy.
2117.0,2118.0, Honestly.
2118.0,2119.0, And I don't think that they were like they could.
2119.0,2122.0," They're like, okay, it's not so wet that I should throw it away."
2122.0,2124.0, But it's like more wet than I want to.
2124.0,2125.0, It was like touching.
2125.0,2126.0, It was like touching.
2126.0,2130.0, So they just looked at maybe do maybe some other dude doesn't really care about all this piss water on and we'll read it.
2130.0,2131.0, Yeah.
2131.0,2136.0," You know, yeah, I was that I mean, it was probably sink water, but who's going to take that chance?"
2136.0,2138.0," EGM, who was it?"
2138.0,2140.0," One of yours, Retronauts, who did that?"
2140.0,2141.0, Who did we give issues to?
2141.0,2143.0, I was in the five of us Brian.
2143.0,2144.0, It's a heart.
2144.0,2145.0, It's a heart.
2145.0,2146.0, Damien.
2146.0,2147.0, It was one of those.
2147.0,2148.0," Oh, shit."
2148.0,2149.0, And did anyone else?
2149.0,2150.0, Chris been boy.
2150.0,2151.0, Or might have grabbed one.
2151.0,2154.0, One of us guys took our new issue into the men's room and then peed on it.
2155.0,2156.0, I'll tell you what.
2156.0,2157.0, I'll tell you what.
2157.0,2158.0, That escalation.
2158.0,2160.0," Yeah, the next EGM that we got."
2160.0,2161.0, I'll tell you.
2161.0,2163.0, Use as a break dance met.
2163.0,2164.0," Worse than that, man."
2164.0,2166.0, You got you got a dog at home.
2166.0,2168.0, I'm going to hold something in for those guys.
2168.0,2169.0, Okay.
2169.0,2170.0, Okay.
2170.0,2172.0, Team Fortress 2.
2172.0,2173.0, Team Fortress 2.
2173.0,2174.0, Yeah.
2174.0,2175.0, Yeah.
2175.0,2176.0, Yeah.
2176.0,2177.0, We was in the aforementioned issue.
2177.0,2179.0, It's going to be weird because like I went to go see it.
2179.0,2180.0, Let's come on.
2180.0,2181.0, Then a half ago now.
2181.0,2182.0, Yeah.
2182.0,2184.0," So yeah, my memory has got to be refreshed here."
2184.0,2185.0, Okay.
2185.0,2187.0, So I went down to or up to or north to develop.
2187.0,2188.0, Yeah.
2188.0,2190.0, To play team Fortress 2.
2190.0,2191.0, First time.
2191.0,2193.0, And I think since the.
2193.0,2195.0, What was that cover story is like.
2195.0,2196.0, It was a little time ago.
2196.0,2197.0, I was a ghost at the moment.
2197.0,2199.0, That was pretty close to when I started.
2199.0,2200.0, Yeah.
2200.0,2201.0, A lot of changes.
2201.0,2202.0, A lot of big changes.
2202.0,2203.0, Good.
2203.0,2204.0, And I found this.
2204.0,2207.0, That's a good question because I went as the total team Fortress
2207.0,2208.0, 2.
2208.0,2212.0," So the changes were kind of like they're explaining to me and I'm like, okay, that sounds"
2212.0,2213.0, Okay.
2213.0,2216.0, I'll have to field some of these changes with Sean here.
2216.0,2218.0," So when I came back, he totally grilled me."
2218.0,2221.0, But as as a new bit it feel good.
2221.0,2222.0, Yeah.
2222.0,2223.0, I felt good.
2223.0,2224.0, Yeah.
2224.0,2226.0, Like I've always been the kind of person who would be inclined to avoid that kind of
2226.0,2230.0, game just thinking my my skills are extremely lacking to be playing a multiplayer
2230.0,2232.0, first person shooter of any kind.
2232.0,2236.0," I play first person shooters, but mostly solo or co-op with people I know."
2236.0,2240.0," But this one I was doing pretty good, but I was also picking a lot of support classes like"
2240.0,2246.0," Medic and spy and engineer, which seemed to not to like say they're not skilled, but"
2246.0,2251.0," they're at least not so dependent on knowing, you know, where to whip your mouse to shoot someone"
2251.0,2252.0, in the head real fast.
2252.0,2253.0, The amount of that.
2253.0,2254.0, The amount of that.
2254.0,2255.0, You showed up.
2255.0,2257.0," The amount of that pre you know, journalists are arriving meeting him."
2257.0,2258.0, Okay.
2258.0,2259.0, Go easy on Sean Melon.
2259.0,2260.0, Go.
2260.0,2261.0, Yeah.
2261.0,2262.0, Just wanted to probably do that.
2262.0,2263.0, That him win.
2263.0,2264.0, So then he'll write a better story.
2264.0,2265.0, And they come up behind you.
2265.0,2268.0," I've had these demos and they're like, that's a head shot."
2268.0,2269.0, Did you see that was good.
2269.0,2270.0," Oh, that was good."
2270.0,2272.0, Took his head clean off his own really good.
2272.0,2274.0," Oh, you got the hang of it now."
2274.0,2275.0," Sean, did you just backstab him?"
2275.0,2276.0, And then the opposite.
2276.0,2278.0, The complete opposite.
2278.0,2283.0," Where it's like they unleash the testers and the testers are like, oh, do we got to prove to these guys?"
2283.0,2284.0, Yeah.
2284.0,2285.0," Cream and that's like, oh, yeah."
2285.0,2286.0, Proved to me.
2286.0,2288.0, She did a game I've been playing for like 35 minutes.
2288.0,2290.0, You've been playing for like 12 months.
2290.0,2291.0," Oh, you're dead again."
2291.0,2293.0," Oh, I'm a professional journalist."
2293.0,2294.0," Oh, you're dead again."
2294.0,2295.0, So there's both.
2295.0,2297.0, That was crying after like 10 minutes.
2297.0,2298.0, That's kind of hard.
2298.0,2302.0," That's why this, this Lucian is just to have the journalist play one another."
2302.0,2303.0, Yeah.
2303.0,2306.0, Sadly not as journalists played online games.
2306.0,2309.0, They're of you for us to have a pop-related games doing that.
2309.0,2311.0, So we have to have the testers.
2311.0,2314.0, It's a big vicious circle.
2314.0,2315.0, Yeah.
2315.0,2319.0," So anyway, the big change number one is grenades be gone."
2319.0,2320.0, Yeah.
2321.0,2322.0, You can't get back when he came back.
2322.0,2323.0, You told me that.
2323.0,2324.0, Yeah.
2324.0,2325.0," As soon as I heard no crunch, I'm like, what?"
2325.0,2327.0, I think we put that on our cupboard in me.
2327.0,2330.0, I don't really put like what WTF no grenades or something.
2330.0,2331.0, Yeah.
2331.0,2332.0, That's some hardcore stuff right there.
2332.0,2333.0, For that to mean anything.
2333.0,2334.0," Anyone that's, yeah."
2334.0,2335.0," No, seriously."
2335.0,2338.0, You got to be as pretty deep in the rabbit hole already for that to scan.
2338.0,2339.0, Yeah.
2339.0,2340.0, It's just in the cupboard.
2340.0,2341.0, No more grenades.
2341.0,2342.0, WTF.
2342.0,2343.0, Okay.
2343.0,2344.0, That's all small down the bottom.
2344.0,2345.0, That's cool.
2345.0,2346.0, If you got your face that close to the magazine.
2346.0,2347.0, You've already bought it.
2347.0,2348.0, You already bought it.
2348.0,2349.0, You already stole your money.
2350.0,2351.0, Yeah.
2351.0,2352.0, You already stole our magazine.
2352.0,2356.0," So of course, the reason that that's like a huge statement."
2356.0,2357.0, Yeah.
2357.0,2361.0, No grenades is that that was one of the defining traits of team fortress classic and team fortress.
2361.0,2362.0, Mm hmm.
2362.0,2363.0, The difference between those.
2363.0,2366.0," I'm just going to say team fortress from now on by which I mean both, you know,"
2366.0,2368.0, team fortress prior to what it is now.
2368.0,2372.0, And so each of that now everyone had a regular hang grenade.
2372.0,2374.0," Um, except for scouts."
2374.0,2375.0," Uh, but."
2375.0,2377.0, And that was actually good and bad.
2378.0,2380.0, But the real thing was that everyone had a secondary grenade.
2380.0,2381.0, That was class specific.
2381.0,2384.0, There was a little overlap between classes like men at the scout.
2384.0,2386.0," Um, and such like that."
2386.0,2389.0," But the cool thing about them was that, you know, the concussion grenades,"
2389.0,2391.0, Darren's talking about or men at the scout.
2391.0,2395.0," And they were basically designed so that, you know, when you have a,"
2395.0,2398.0," a class that's supposed to be quick and nimble, but that's not going to be just like a big,"
2398.0,2400.0," you know, gun fighter."
2400.0,2402.0," You're able to throw it on on a stronger opponent,"
2402.0,2405.0, dizzy him and buy yourself some time to escape.
2405.0,2409.0," And of course, people found out that they were ultimately propulsion pads for,"
2409.0,2412.0," for rapid mobility, job as well."
2412.0,2417.0," And that completely as a, as a, as a medic as a clan player as a both a medic in a scout."
2417.0,2421.0," This, so like, it's like, you know, I said this elsewhere, but it's like, you know,"
2421.0,2425.0," in a fighting game, it's a find out that your main character has been altered for a sequel."
2425.0,2429.0, And they hear after took out some of just like your bread and butter moves.
2429.0,2433.0," You know, like I based like the majority of my strategy around like a 3B with nightmarin."
2433.0,2436.0," So caliber 2, that's basically an unupercut."
2436.0,2440.0, And then you find out that they made it so that the properties are different.
2440.0,2443.0," It's, it's really like that for someone that plays a hardcore."
2443.0,2448.0," Some of, but, but, but also it means that the game's got to be radically rebalanced."
2448.0,2454.0," The other example that I mentioned, I'll try to like repeat myself because I just realize some of this is going up on the one-up show Friday."
2454.0,2459.0," Is that the engineers had the electric magnetopulse grenade, which is used to destroy,"
2459.0,2462.0," I mean, explode ammunition, other players carried."
2462.0,2472.0," So that made them effective against heavy duty, heavy weapons guys who would then have to decide that they might want to throw away some of their ammo before going into the blue engineers basement, you know."
2472.0,2474.0, So it was basically the long story short.
2474.0,2476.0, It's really important to take that out.
2476.0,2481.0," It now means, and it's for a good thing is that instead of, it just means that instead of"
2481.0,2486.0," different using grenades as one of very important way of differentiating classes from one another,"
2486.0,2490.0, they have to do a lot more to the classes to differentiate them.
2490.0,2491.0, Right.
2491.0,2494.0," Well, you know, you know, I'm thinking about this, just playing doubles out of it."
2494.0,2501.0," I've figured for a second, you have a generation of people that grew up playing TF and would kick anybody's ass that was new to the game,"
2501.0,2506.0," just trying to get started out because they know all the maps, all the secrets, all the, all the conch jumping and all that stuff."
2506.0,2511.0," And like, it's like basically getting on the freeway with a jalapia and trying to go like the speed limit."
2511.0,2515.0," You can, you can run all the way there's some element of reset button here because number one,"
2515.0,2516.0, it's coming to 362.
2516.0,2517.0, Exactly.
2517.0,2522.0," Number two, they're kind of packaging it almost as like, hey, everyone who might not be interested,"
2522.0,2524.0," look how colorful and bright this is, and how cool."
2524.0,2525.0, Yeah.
2525.0,2531.0," It's coming bundled with two other games that like, I wouldn't have bought, I wouldn't have thought probably to buy a team for it just to buy itself."
2531.0,2535.0, But knowing that it comes with half life episode two and portal to games.
2535.0,2536.0, And that's a great idea.
2536.0,2537.0, That's how I feel.
2537.0,2538.0, I feel like that's how I'll explain.
2538.0,2539.0, Very smart.
2539.0,2540.0, Yeah.
2540.0,2541.0," You have life, you know."
2541.0,2542.0, It's three very different types of games.
2542.0,2549.0, And the advanced to conspiracy theory that these are almost being made to dumb the game down to ultimately make it work crossplath.
2549.0,2552.0, Not crossplath or but to make it work on multiple platforms.
2552.0,2553.0, Okay.
2553.0,2557.0, So with basically long search hard to make it work with a controller interface before I advanced that theory.
2557.0,2562.0," I want to say that they have very, very credible reasons for wanting to eliminate the grenades in the game."
2562.0,2571.0," First of all, it's just grenades or became a problem, especially the regular explosive grenades in that every character would would get like one or two."
2571.0,2575.0, You can go and get more from your your ammo bags in your spawns.
2575.0,2582.0, And ultimately even people that aren't just run out into the open and throw them and throw grenades and the timers are taking it different intervals.
2582.0,2583.0, Yeah.
2583.0,2586.0, Some grenades like blow up it like the nerves and make more grenades.
2586.0,2592.0, And ultimately instead of the kind of game that you're talking about Darren were like it's really based on you know placement of shots or everything.
2592.0,2599.0, It's just like you walk outside and like boom you have no idea why but you've lost you're like down to 10% health and then like more explosions.
2600.0,2601.0, That's exactly why I played.
2601.0,2601.98, It's why you.
2601.98,2604.98, If you suck there's nothing easier than just tossingj surtout íê²s.
2606.06,2609.4," Alright Tytsrey, I will just spawn it and just bull."
2610.9,2612.0," You do that, you go."
2612.0,2613.0," It's like gonna, it's on."
2614.0,2615.0, Outside the spawn door.
2616.0,2618.0, It's classic.
2618.0,2621.0, It's like you can always expect there's like hallucinogenic grenades from the spies like popping out there's murves going off.
2621.0,2622.0, There's pipe balms.
2622.0,2627.0, There's like nail grenades and it's just like you're saying you're running to you and two-four.
2627.0,2630.36," and two-four you're running to the basement of your opponent's base. Like, oh yeah, I just"
2630.36,2634.36," I'm going to take the spiral, you know, staircase, so I'm going to pass by their spawn."
2634.36,2637.72," I got something for you. Yeah, there's a demo man train as a screen."
2637.72,2640.2, It's just look at the equivalent of the pipe bomb. Yeah.
2640.2,2642.2," Yeah, the one where you detonate with your left hand."
2642.2,2645.8," So, I think you change the medic too. Let's, yeah, let's show some."
2645.8,2649.64, The biggest change. Better be good. Because that was my favorite.
2649.64,2654.12," Yeah, like I said, I've never played the old medic so you'll have to do the comparison for me,"
2654.12,2659.56," but the new medic basically is a healer. Like, you spend a lot of your time with this healing gun"
2659.96,2662.7599999999998, and you walk behind. Link on. Link on. Link on.
2662.7599999999998,2666.68," Lately, she seriously is always like, he's all in his base. Yeah. You walk behind. Like,"
2666.68,2670.7599999999998," most of the time, like, you latch yourself to a heavier, whatever. No poisoning. No nothing."
2670.7599999999998,2676.04," No poisoning. So, I get like, you have a thermic needle gun, which they said was a little stronger than any"
2676.04,2680.92," other, like, you know, just straight up up in the hammer to head in the past. So now they're pretty"
2681.88,2685.8," kind of, but you walk behind a medic, you hide behind a rock and make sure, you know,"
2685.8,2690.44," with the line of sight and not within. So you have a hypergermic needle gun that will kind of like,"
2690.44,2693.88," it's a straight up damage. Okay. And it's like, they said it was a little bit better than"
2693.88,2696.76," whatever they had before, but probably better than the deal with them. So what they mean. Yeah."
2698.52,2703.7200000000003," And the other thing, while you're, you know, healing the heavier, whoever you also"
2703.7200000000003,2708.12," filling this charge meter and when it hits the max, you can use the old fire to make you and"
2708.12,2712.3599999999997," whoever you're linked to invincible. That's kind of a major way you're like, to push you through things."
2712.3599999999997,2717.16," I think that could be cool. That could be, it's needed to touch the hell out of it. The way I played,"
2717.16,2722.52," you know, in client plants, too, I saw it definitely, it advanced. It's basically easier to"
2722.52,2727.16," to play defense, not game the offense, or you just conversely just have to be far more coordinated on"
2727.16,2733.3199999999997, your offense. And that could be a good way to help help some of the stalemate issues. Right.
2733.32,2737.88," I just want to pause to point out for the last, I don't know how many minutes. 10, 15."
2738.6800000000003,2741.96, We're all talking. And Ryan's is sitting here reading the max.
2743.96,2749.2400000000002," That's, that's how good our new issue is. This is quite an advertisement for GFW."
2751.2400000000002,2754.84," They said, what was it? Go ahead. You can keep breathing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, go back."
2754.84,2758.1200000000003," You'll back to your, just pretend we're talking to Guild Wars. It's like a guy in the library."
2758.12,2764.7599999999998," We're all talking. Don't mind us, Ryan. Other, some other stuff you're saying. I mean, clearly"
2766.2,2770.92, spies cannot faint death anymore. That could be a physics problem that they couldn't get around.
2771.88,2778.52," But you could still disguise, right? And then they're still cloak instead of throwing grenades from a"
2778.52,2784.2799999999997, cloaked state on enemy century turrets. They can now sort of disrupt her device to use on the turrets to
2784.28,2788.36, shut them down. So they're getting around the blades in that. It's pretty real though.
2788.36,2792.36," This by, huh? I mean, eh? How many ups, it's not vapor."
2792.36,2794.44, Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You see it's kind of exciting.
2794.44,2799.4," Maps for well. Yeah. I bet I see I just, I bet just, I mean, I mean, I for so long."
2799.4,2804.36," But now I'm still living. Can I, can I get over the, it's sort of like how I used to be a"
2804.36,2809.6400000000003," gigantic warriors fan. And then every year when they almost came close, I, you know, I just"
2809.6400000000003,2813.88, numb myself to it. I don't give a shit because I don't want to get my heart broken again. And now
2813.96,2818.36," this year, it's kind of real again. So can I feel that way about it? Right. It feels that way."
2818.36,2824.04, And that's pretty much the only reason why he's reading the magazine. He just does not want his heart broken.
2824.04,2827.88, Right. I know. I don't know what to hear about team for just two. Don't do it. Don't make
2827.88,2832.92," a great thing. I'm happy. And then sad. So really, it's going to come out. Yeah."
2832.92,2837.2400000000002," Yeah. Actually, right. Okay. In a box with two other games. Then the less."
2838.36,2841.56, I'm going to hate you. So yeah. What other big things? They'll be checking scout.
2841.88,2846.6," Oh, I'm just clearingly another, that's the thing that makes me wonder. A double jumping"
2846.6,2852.2, scout seems like so obviously like a way of making a conk jumping available to bowtards.
2852.2,2857.7999999999997," Ah, so like, yeah, that's like my trade prime right there. Yeah bowtards. Yeah, that's a long story."
2857.7999999999997,2862.12," Like, both seasons like a vocational school, like, we're going to grade school. My girlfriend's"
2862.12,2867.0, off from New York. And so both seasons. I don't like that. Yeah. There's a lot of fun words.
2867.0,2869.88, You can make it like bowseful. And boasting boasting. Boasting. Boasting.
2869.88,2871.88, Boasting. Boasting. Boasting. Boasting. Boasting. Boasting. Boasting.
2872.52,2875.64," Yeah. But anyway. Oh, there's just one tech. Yeah. Like, you could like, there's a, that's"
2875.64,2880.68," a bow tech. There was just one tech is part of it. Basically our experience with Halo 2, trying to,"
2881.24,2886.12," Halo 2 Vista, trying to install that. Oh, that's a monster segue. I'll spell it."
2886.12,2890.36," So, okay. So the quick thing like I was saying about, are we recording here? Yeah. We're fine."
2890.36,2894.36," Okay. So if, if the double jumping again, I'm just speculating. Yeah."
2894.36,2898.44," I'm not playing it not me, but like my worry there is that like, okay, they realize we're making a"
2898.44,2901.2400000000002," game. You need to build play of control and stuff to you. People aren't going to be like,"
2901.2400000000002,2905.48," X, heat, con, jumps, timing, and that stuff. So let's just let them double jump. I don't know. Okay."
2905.48,2910.92," But the cynical part of me is like, a damn well better not be what you're doing for the PSP version."
2910.92,2915.56," Oh, they had a dad a double jumping to the, uh, what the, the unreal series. So I mean,"
2916.28,2920.2000000000003, I don't know. It's all in the implementation. Maybe it'll work. Maybe it won't. I don't know.
2920.4399999999996,2925.08, I'm going to miss Kong jumping. That's for sure. How about the just the overall vibe of the game?
2925.8799999999997,2931.3199999999997," The art. The cool. I mean, where you look really cool. Like, I give it the, I think they pulled off the, uh,"
2932.04,2936.2, the stylistic change. Yeah. Like all the screens have seen a lot. It looks really like it's a
2936.2,2940.52, lot of character. And it just really easy. And this was what they said their point was for changing
2940.52,2944.7599999999998, all of the models. But like it's really easy to pick out from even really far away what
2945.2400000000002,2949.6400000000003, class you're fighting. And then I like this is after you know playing an hour. Just from the silhouettes and all.
2949.6400000000003,2953.96," Yeah. I mean, yeah. You're totally all that all the stuff they talked about like, you know, silhouettes trying"
2954.5200000000004,2958.36, you have a big difference. You're doing a new season action. Yeah. Totally does work. Yeah.
2958.36,2961.48," Before to see it a lot more. Like the way they designed those maps, like at least the"
2961.48,2967.5600000000004, few that we the shot and I saw what was it a year ago almost the long time. A while ago. We saw two
2967.64,2973.96," fort and Sean saw well. Yeah. That's a two for it, which is identical. I guess to the original."
2973.96,2978.2799999999997, And then well and dustball were revamped. But so they're kind of like spiritual successives. Yeah.
2978.2799999999997,2985.64," And then a new one is I was hydro, which had a weird kind of gimmick in that like, you fight over the"
2985.64,2990.7599999999998, control points. And they're just going to be really hard to explain without like some sort of white
2990.7599999999998,2995.48, port. This is going to do it on your way for one up show. Yeah. We're for the one up here. I can talk about it there.
2995.56,2999.8," Or by the magazine or by the magazine. Speaking of which, should we talk about any of the other stuff here?"
3000.92,3004.84, Let's just say we already been going for a while. Yeah. And we haven't given the
3005.56,3011.0, you got all games. You got your Vanguard beef. Or do you want to talk non-game? Let's jump out of games.
3011.0,3018.04," It's about bookers. It asks. Well, there's that other topic we can talk about. I don't know. How"
3018.04,3024.92," do you know, neurotic we get over. Hey, I love mail. Oh, that's a weird stuff. Oh, yeah. Ryan,"
3024.92,3031.0," just better get you to loosen those lips. As a bar is a fray bill. Okay. So,"
3032.04,3036.6," well, Sean, it's you're deleted. I'll just ask how to ask you. I just like clearly,"
3037.24,3041.64," you mean, well, there's, you know, we'll get feedback directly and indirectly on message boards."
3041.64,3045.4, We're talking to one another about us on ours where they might be talking directly to us.
3045.96,3050.28," You know, mail. I know it affects you. Yeah, but I want to ask like how like, do you guys,"
3050.28,3055.0," I mean, how do you guys like deal with it? Do you like it? Do you ignore it? Do you love it? Do you"
3055.0,3061.32," take to do it? Like what? I think I have to admit, I'm kind of addicted to it. I mean, I'm always"
3061.32,3066.44," looking for feedback on the magazine because I want to know. Yes. I encourage it. It turns, I know Jeff"
3067.0,3071.2400000000002," definitely true for you. I'm going to do a psychological diagnosis, psychologic diagnosis,"
3071.24,3078.4399999999996," go for it. It turns you into a bitch in that. No, it turns you into them. No,"
3078.4399999999996,3084.2799999999997," it turns a certified opinion right there. Yeah. Okay, it turns you and how it turns your boss into"
3084.2799999999997,3090.2799999999997," no, into the woman who's like, you didn't tell me I'm pretty today. You know what I'm saying? Like,"
3090.2799999999997,3094.12," you got to hear a man with the wife. Yeah. And you're so, you're a man that could tell me that"
3094.12,3099.4799999999996," that doesn't know what I'm saying. But like, you know, the, you know, how like the stereo, okay,"
3099.56,3103.08," so let me apologize to the woman out there. Like the very, the upper stereo typical and it's"
3103.08,3107.2400000000002, meant too. But let's say it's a vain guy. Say it's the guy who waxes his toes or something.
3107.2400000000002,3111.64," That's an wrong way. She's a hair office toes. Oh, that reminds me. And he wants you know, you just say,"
3111.64,3115.56," like, did you notice? Did you notice my nice shiny toes? Yeah. Yeah."
3115.56,3120.2, Yeah. I just got to play boy wax. You're comparing me to a guy who shades his toes.
3121.48,3124.04," Actually, we're going to tell you something. You're supposed to be so excited. Oh,"
3124.04,3129.4," you're time me to shave my toes. I'm missing the point straight up. That is the show. No,"
3129.48,3135.64," I think, I mean, yeah, I do, I do check the message boards. I do get bummed if, I mean,"
3135.64,3139.88," but listen, you and I end up talking each other down from the same things. Like, you'll still be"
3139.88,3143.88," so messaged part of like, man, Sean Ali's voice is, or so fucking dumb."
3145.08,3148.44," And then you're just like, all right, that's it. I'm never doing that again. And we add"
3148.44,3154.12," it to go like Sean is one dude. So, you know, we both do because I do that too. Or if I, you know,"
3154.12,3158.04," I'll get an email. Like, I get pretty nice email. Also the time I bought my calm, but everyone's"
3158.12,3161.72," in a while though, be what we want. I think it's stupid. It's funny. I've ever read."
3162.2799999999997,3167.0," And then I'm just like at home, like I'm in the dark and the lights are off in my wife's with what's wrong,"
3167.0,3173.96," Jeff. Oh, my failure. I'm just saying what that's why I avoided it. No, I'm just saying exactly."
3173.96,3179.08," Like, I can get like a hundred greedy emails and then one just says, you're a total asshole. You got"
3179.08,3183.88," this wrong. Yeah. You got that wrong. And I'll just, I'll fix it on that for a few more months."
3183.88,3189.08," And I'll be like, I got to fix this shit. Yeah. It's hard. I mean, I think people don't realize"
3189.08,3194.28," really like the kind of, because what's always funny, too, is when if you write people back. And then"
3194.28,3199.32," Sean, you and I were talking about this. That's it. The law. This is a lot of the EICs. This was"
3199.32,3204.52," a little bit. Right. You write them back. You know what they said. Right. Cause some, you know, then"
3204.52,3208.76," but this is only if you're an editor in chief. You got a special. Yes. I can tell you,"
3208.76,3212.76," you got a lot of compensation. You get a, you get a, you get a G. Right. Because if, you know, if somebody"
3212.84,3215.88," writes me, it says like, my calm is the biggest piece of shit they ever read. They haven't"
3215.88,3221.88," laughed once in five years. They wish I'd go away and die. And then I write him back and I'm like,"
3221.88,3227.32," you know, hey, you know, different strokes. I guess, you know, so I don't like it. I hope you keep"
3227.32,3230.92, reading the magazine anyway. All right. So I'm kind of sincere like that. And then they write me back.
3230.92,3235.0," It's like, oh, man, I reread my thing. And it's kind of harsh. Actually, you're pretty funny."
3236.36,3240.36, I'm always really like doing just not making this. I'm not making it up. I'm not even
3240.36,3245.2400000000002," exaggerating. There's one today on your blog. Yeah. I was like, I'm a block. Yeah, the guy backed off after"
3245.2400000000002,3250.04," like two minutes. I've seen it happen with a Dan shoe from EGM, the new gaming age forms and"
3250.04,3254.6," his own forms. But what I would like, but they're like, but it's the EICs. I mean, and then when"
3254.6,3260.04," when you guys go in there, there's like, you know, it's like boom, like, oh, like, oh, thanks so much for"
3260.04,3266.36," for posting here. But like, dude, like, he's right. Like, we just like to like the shows, you know, we go in there."
3266.36,3270.36," They don't care. They're not going to like back down because like, oh, it's so cute."
3270.36,3271.96, It's so cute. As whole.
3273.96,3277.1600000000003," RGFW letters in box. You know, I'll respond to those."
3277.7200000000003,3282.2000000000003, I tried to record this. And I get I've gotten the same kind of decision to read that. Usually they're
3282.2000000000003,3285.32," surprised. We were spawned and that's what I wanted to say before. It's like, I think a lot of people"
3285.32,3290.52," writing don't realize we're like, just people sitting at desk. You know, we're just like regular people."
3290.52,3294.76," So when E-mail shows up in your inbox and you read it, it can't have an effect on you."
3294.84,3298.2000000000003," Like someone, someone, if you're imagine, I mean, anyone listening this podcast,"
3298.2000000000003,3302.0400000000004, imagine you're your job and you get an email that all of a sudden says you're a big fucking asshole.
3303.6400000000003,3308.5200000000004," I mean, it can affect you. You know, I mean, I know we're in the public sort of."
3308.5200000000004,3311.5600000000004," Yeah. So I like you have to expect it, but it can still get to you."
3311.5600000000004,3315.7200000000003," Especially if someone calls you out on something personally on something you created, right?"
3315.7200000000003,3320.28," Like, but for some reason, like, bitching is always louder than praise."
3320.28,3323.96," And like, you, I think before there'd be some dreaded, it's like just a bunch of people are like,"
3324.44,3329.0, pretty happy for you. I know. There's like one guy. It says something bad.
3329.0,3333.2400000000002," And you're like, point that out. Like, do it. Yeah. There's like 20 positive responses."
3333.2400000000002,3336.92," Wait, but what? Well, if you were like, you know, if you do a research, you know, you can,"
3336.92,3341.16," you was like completely ignore them. But no, instead, when you're, when it's talking about you,"
3341.16,3344.84," like, that's all you see. Yeah. That's totally the same way."
3344.84,3348.44," It's been a counter session. But yeah, not really you do the same thing. But I,"
3349.4,3353.4," because of that, like, avoid things mostly. Like, I'll usually only look at a,"
3353.4,3355.48," a form of threat, if like, Sean aims at to me."
3356.52,3360.76," Otherwise, I'm pretty out of there. Because I don't even, as I know how it affects me, so I'm just going to be like,"
3361.4,3365.08, I know it's going to affect me. And I know how stupid it is that would affect me. So I'm going to
3365.08,3368.84," yeah. Actually, I spent entire days reading some of those boards. There's like, there's some really great stuff"
3368.84,3371.88," to tell about boards. And you know, even some, so yeah. Have you guys googled your own name?"
3372.52,3377.64," I have. Yeah. I try not to do that. There's a lot of me, though. Most, the most famous one is"
3377.64,3382.2799999999997," the construction company owner. Sean, a life. Yeah. Congratulations on the life. I got Jeff Green."
3382.2799999999997,3386.2799999999997, There's a NASCAR race. Yeah. You're going to NASCAR guys. So there's a lot of Ryan Scott.
3386.68,3391.16, Really? Yeah. I wonder how many from Reed Magazine's during their own podcasts.
3392.6,3396.2," So one, as you guys delve into Wajja territory. Let me,"
3397.0,3401.24," bring it back for you. Wajja, this word I keep using again is like embarrassment by proxy. So"
3401.24,3406.12," like these guys are making me feel like you feel when you watch Borat. Hey, you brought it up, man."
3406.44,3410.68," So you're topic. I know. I know. I'm bringing this back. I just want to say like, I do want to think"
3410.92,3416.04," like, especially last week. Yeah. When we, when we do have the people that have good stuff to say"
3416.04,3420.6," about us, they get us attention. And this week, we, for a very short time at least,"
3421.96,3428.2," we're with, we're in the top 10 of iTunes games and hobbies podcast. And it's people like those"
3428.2,3432.44," that go out of their way and say, you know, because we're talking about this, not, you know, like how"
3432.76,3438.12," you got serious love for a piece. It's a weird thing. As a PC podcast, we don't have, we don't necessarily"
3438.12,3443.4, start off with the same pool potential listeners that we would if we were platform agnostic. And so it's
3443.4,3448.04, cool when we're able to to break that. Although that's kind of a lame excuse when I think they're like
3448.04,3454.28, two World Warcraft based podcast. It's often a head of us. There's a lot of this. There's already
3454.28,3459.2400000000002," there. But no, like, like, no, so I just, I don't know, I just want to say thanks to the people"
3459.24,3463.9599999999996," that like help help spread the word that's. Yeah. That's it. Actually, here. So it's for them that I'll"
3463.9599999999996,3468.12," go out of my way every week and come up with some some skaters, some extra entertainment for"
3469.16,3473.16," just show up your life. Just tell us you love us. Actually, to get back to the people I was thinking,"
3473.16,3478.12," like, I actually found the whiskey nerds Z board at the Guild Wars overlay. Oh, that's true."
3478.12,3482.04," Yeah, we actually, we actually found the actual one. The actual with pizza grease. We had it by"
3482.04,3487.72," your fatality. And we need to like, we get the FTW keys actually right or do you make that up?"
3487.8799999999997,3490.7599999999998," Well, you could bind it to that. You could bind it to every door. I mean, that. Oh,"
3492.7599999999998,3499.0," I was wondering, how long did you know that's E-boy? So what we have it here, and we want to give it"
3499.0,3503.8799999999997," away to someone, one of like those extreme listeners, but we got to find some, I think of a worthy"
3503.8799999999997,3507.08," contest, just something to make it make it worth giving away. Yeah, maybe if someone like,"
3507.72,3511.56," I don't know, let's not turn it into the damn sink Pokemon contest. Oh, no, definitely not."
3511.56,3516.6," That you're the ultimate Nintendo fan or previous. Oh, it's, usually like when we run a contest,"
3516.68,3520.8399999999997," we run it the other way. Like, like we had who's the biggest slime bag. All right."
3521.64,3525.3199999999997," It's ultimately, I think probably inspired that whole skit, you know? Yeah, it's actually like"
3525.3199999999997,3530.2," dudes that yeah. Well, I mean, the whole contest, you know, how do you prove talking about"
3530.2,3534.12," you know, and Joe's and talk about people sending pictures of their rooms? It looked like"
3534.12,3539.96, basically cesspools. Was it theme? All right. So maybe you should just post a post and kind of
3540.8399999999997,3544.92, offer up the contest. Like if taking suggestions for next week or if you just come up with some
3545.88,3550.44," Ryan. Oh, I feel like this all this like we just fell apart here is because it's Ryan's point at the clock."
3550.44,3555.92," Yeah, and podcasting along time. We started late. Sorry. And we have maybe finished our"
3555.92,3560.12," now we ruined it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, let's start over. So,"
3560.12,3565.08," okay, whatever the contest, let's do the usual. I'll give me ideas on our on the GFW ready. Right."
3565.08,3569.08," If we're not in the right, GFW forums. Yeah, I'll start on podcast. I'll start off thread to"
3569.08,3573.96," Okay, tonight or tomorrow. We're in whiskey nerd Z board. We're in whiskey board. And it's the"
3573.96,3579.88, Guild Wars. We're in peace of Greece. So we'll send you that is luxury. It is like me. Yeah.
3582.04,3587.56, So we haven't got to the event. Our thing. Ryan's a big moment. He's been waiting for this all day.
3587.56,3594.36, All day. Yeah. No pressure. No pressure. Basically just to introduce it. If you haven't seen
3595.32,3601.8," Brad McQuade, the CEO and chairman of Situ Entertainment and one of the lead developers, originally"
3601.8,3611.0, developers on the game posted a pretty massive epic post about the state of Vanguard and where it's
3611.0,3616.6," going and it's a pretty unbelievable read. So I'm sure I'm sure the people here PR, SOA is really"
3616.6,3623.56," static about this going up. Yeah. So that's the thing when you read it, you got to plot this guy for"
3624.84,3629.88, just for a second. He's a kinder. He has always had that and that's one cool thing about it.
3629.88,3635.7200000000003," He kind of lays it on the line with his game. And this is one big, uh, I don't know what you"
3635.7200000000003,3639.96," caught. Me a culpard or something. Yeah. One big. But it's like, I mean, like, what if you said, like,"
3639.96,3644.44," hey, we messed up, like, we printed a shit article or something. You know, and then you end right with"
3644.44,3648.76, the never-winner night's thing way back. Do you don't even start that? We'll come back to the end
3648.76,3653.8," because no, that's a whole other podcast. Because actually when I was on vacation, I thought I'm like,"
3653.88,3657.0, if there's something I can come back after vacation to talk about. And I had all these
3657.0,3661.0800000000004," epipenies. I'm like, yeah, it's to come back and defend that review and the writer of that review."
3661.6400000000003,3665.88," You're right. Yeah. I'll bring that back. We'll bring it back another time. Yeah, but like,"
3665.88,3671.1600000000003, encounter points. That's definitely. Yeah. We'll get a pick them on the phone too. I'll come
3671.1600000000003,3677.0800000000004," in and fight and ride. It's come back to me. Yeah. But okay. So I just want to say that. Like,"
3677.0800000000004,3682.2000000000003," I don't want shit too hard on this guy for, well, I'm brand-maquad. Yeah. No, no, I mean, I don't"
3682.2,3687.72," know. Yeah. I mean, I put this on my blog to a blog about today. And this is not like,"
3687.72,3693.56," I'm not definitely not doing like a, uh, about this game or about these developers. Yeah. I've,"
3693.56,3697.24," I've wanted this game to be good. I just think it's been like a clusterfuck of like,"
3697.24,3703.56," bad decision making. Some of it has some of it. The people at Sony, I think it's unfortunate"
3703.56,3708.8399999999997," because I do think that behind it all, there's like the potential for a great game here. And it"
3708.92,3713.6400000000003," never, it's never good to see a game that's taken this long and so many resources and so many"
3713.6400000000003,3719.08," hours not do well. So I'm not like, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to kick a dead horse here,"
3719.08,3723.48, right? Yeah. But I do think this is interesting to talk about this because it was such an amazing
3723.48,3727.96," hell. No, totally. In fact, that post exists, you know. Yeah. How can you see this? I can't"
3727.96,3731.56," I might, I can't, and just just to add on to that. I mean, it's not like we actually"
3731.56,3735.88," want to see any game fail. We want to, you know, we don't take any pleasure in bashing something."
3735.96,3740.04," You don't. I think it goes about saying, but there has, I mean, someone probably could correctly"
3740.04,3744.84," point out that there is an element of of us, the self-sense faction of the person you said,"
3744.84,3749.8," I told you so. Oh, yeah. They ended up dead telling, there's threats about this about those"
3749.8,3753.6400000000003," McQuay posts today on the internet where there's like page after page of people going,"
3753.6400000000003,3759.6400000000003," ha ha. Yeah. Basically, what a joke. Right. It was coming. But again, we did know it was coming."
3759.6400000000003,3763.6400000000003," But I'm able to say, told you so is because he told us first. Well, right. Remember from the beginning,"
3763.72,3769.4," he said, this is too soon. Yep. Yep. You don't want this. It's too soon. Yeah. He was,"
3769.4,3772.2799999999997," he was, he was, he was, he was, he was me a coping, and before the game even shipped because he was like,"
3772.2799999999997,3776.6, we needed more time. The only ha ha I did on my blog was just about the fact that people were
3776.6,3781.56," giving a shit about our three out of ten review. Yeah. Because I felt like, okay, well, yeah,"
3781.56,3786.52," this guy has now reviewed his own game and given it an even lower score, basically. Right. So,"
3786.52,3792.12," so let's, let's hop to the end. That's it. All that says. All that says. For it. Well, I'm not going to read this"
3792.8399999999997,3798.92," whole letter because I would take the whole podcast. But when he says, I'll read a couple of"
3798.92,3803.64," excerpts. Brad says, and so he is in discussions with Sidil regarding the future of Vanguard"
3803.64,3811.88," and Sidil games. Talks are going well. First and foremost, our primary concern right now is what's"
3811.88,3816.04, best for Vanguard and its community. We want to ensure that this game and its community have a
3816.04,3821.32, healthy future. Does that mean an acquisition? Does this mean more or less people at Sidil or
3821.32,3827.64," a change in management? I can't say at this point. What does mean is at this point, the both companies"
3827.64,3831.64, agree that we need more of SOS involvement. If Vanguard is going to continue to get the support
3831.64,3835.64," and needs to both continue to be worked on and improve and be bogged and optimized. So,"
3835.64,3842.36, you can probably read between the lines there. And he goes on and on pretty much just say that
3842.6800000000003,3848.36," all the EQ players will look at it and just, you know, all the EQ players who now have like"
3848.36,3853.4, families and jobs and not necessarily the time for a big involved in a low. And we'll look
3853.4,3858.2000000000003," at it and say, oh, well, this looks like another EQ and I don't have time for that anymore. And so"
3858.2000000000003,3862.36, then they won't give the game another thought. And he also basically admits that the system specs
3862.36,3867.48," are way too out of control to target. Yeah, he actually pretty much says you're going to need to buy a new"
3867.56,3873.8," PC to play his game and a little bit of a problem. Yeah. And even if you buy a new PC,"
3873.8,3879.56, still doesn't run that well. And the biggest thing he says what the game needs is a relaunch of
3879.56,3884.6," sorts, including targeted marketing campaigns and all around successful move by gamers with an"
3884.6,3891.16," ex-generation of hardware continued good word of mouth, viral marketing by those who are already"
3891.16,3895.96, playing and doing and resubscribing. And I think you're talking about like this happening like
3896.04,3901.4," in a year, right, or end of this year. So my god. Right. He says there, they're arguably a lot of"
3901.4,3906.04, people who buy mid to end of this year in the emojis game space for who bank hard. So he's going to
3906.04,3914.28," try to get into the top 10 of iTunes. Yeah. Except we finished the podcast before we really,"
3914.28,3919.0," we put it up on iTunes. So yeah, we recorded half of it. We're going to record the other half"
3919.96,3924.04," but hey, subscribe now anyway. We're going to patch this podcast a little bit."
3924.04,3929.0," Okay. We'll give you the good hour of the show. We'll become a Darren wasn't in yet, but we're"
3929.0,3935.32, going to double his parts in later. So he's the band behind this game is going on record saying
3935.32,3942.68, that it needs to re-watch. Yeah. Of sorts. So what aside from the marketing that he eludes to
3942.68,3951.3199999999997," would acquisition do for him? Well, yeah, that's really hard to say. You know, I mean,"
3951.3199999999997,3956.04, there's a lot of theories running rampant on the internet as it wants to happen on the internet.
3956.04,3960.3599999999997," Some people are saying, well, Sony's actually just going to acquire a digital"
3960.3599999999997,3966.8399999999997," and Vanguard just so they can shut it down. Which, which makes sense in a vacuum, but it doesn't"
3966.8399999999997,3971.24, make sense in reality. That's like the people who never shut that. Any people for last week's
3971.24,3978.6," law state do their purgatory, they're purgatory. But they're some logic to that. Right. If Sony considers"
3978.6,3982.7599999999998," a singing albatross and they're after paying, they're having to pay for the servers and pay to"
3982.7599999999998,3988.7599999999998," to support this thing as publishers. And it's like bleeding money, then yeah. And maybe part of"
3988.7599999999998,3994.12, that is true. But the fact is they're also supporting games like Matrix Online. So apparently
3994.12,3998.52, they're willing to take on any MMO and let it run forever. So I don't see them shutting down.
3998.52,4002.2, So what else do they hold cable subscription model? Do you pay one price and you have access to this whole
4002.92,4008.28," world, you know, different, you know, universe of games? Yeah. Still. I've never understood that."
4008.28,4013.32," And you need. He also talks about how like, Lord of things gets it right. He does talk about how"
4013.32,4017.4," I buy it. Well, that's got to be killing him, right? I mean, that Lord of the Rings sort of came from"
4017.4,4021.16, here. I don't want to say from out of nowhere because it's been around forever. But it certainly
4021.16,4026.04, had no expectations in the leading up to a chance. It's not really worth. This is it.
4026.04,4029.64, You see what I did there.
4029.64,4033.48, My favorite Lord of the Rings. And off-brotted.
4033.48,4035.48, On his horse.
4035.48,4037.96," Okay, that's true. Wash it out."
4037.96,4044.2, I actually my favorite MMO was seeing a respectable work.
4044.2,4048.2, The wash on the wall. The wash on the wall was seeing like Gandalf on the New York Stock Exchange.
4048.2,4051.0, The clad big rig in the closing bell or whatever that was.
4051.0,4052.68, It was tough people were already. What?
4052.68,4055.64," Pitcher. Well, there was this picture from midway, like,"
4055.64,4059.7999999999997," probably, so they had like to celebrate the launch of the Loder game last week."
4059.7999999999997,4065.08," They had some like CEO and kind of, and a whole cast of characters dressed up like they're from"
4065.08,4069.72, the middle-earth on the Wall Street Stock Exchange for the air was dressed up as characters.
4069.72,4073.7999999999997," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Didn't see that. Well, not the CEO, but I thought that was the real Gandalf."
4075.08,4078.04, I was up there with watching Bush present Bush dance.
4078.2799999999997,4083.0, Pure washa. All right. Enough fun.
4083.0,4088.12, I'm Dan Garth. Yeah. So it's going to be interesting to follow. See what happens. We don't know what's
4088.12,4092.68, going to happen with Sidgell or this game. It's going to be interesting to watch and boy. This
4092.68,4098.6, would make an awesome post-mortem game when it down the line. Sure would. To get those guys to
4098.6,4104.36," like just talk about what the hell happened for real. This game. Well, Brad's a straight shooter."
4104.36,4108.44," I think you would be open for it. Well, we had Jeff Butler on this podcast before the launch"
4108.44,4114.36, and he was pretty open to about what was going on. Definitely. What is the next chapter in
4114.36,4119.0, Baton the God. I had a piece of a sucker for God. I might have some reader questions. I had like a
4119.0,4122.599999999999, piece of reader mail that I wanted. Did you want to hit the hill of two thing at all or did you want
4122.599999999999,4127.24," to even bother? Hey, if Ryan Ryan this whole time looks like he needs to get on the train."
4127.24,4129.719999999999," Yeah, you itching to get on the train. Yeah, right. Come on."
4129.72,4134.04," Yeah, it's kind of late. We're reading this. Is it late? Are you going to be able to get on the"
4134.04,4140.2," train or do you have to sleep on the office or now? Oh, no. Shit. Hey, if you have to. All right. You"
4140.2,4146.04," own that train. All right. I think we should talk about Halo 2 next week. Yeah, you know,"
4146.04,4150.6, we'll get it. If you go and if you if you got a roll like we haven't even been going we've been like an hour
4151.320000000001,4156.4400000000005," right. Technically. Our in five minutes people want longer than that. That's not long enough. Well,"
4156.44,4159.879999999999," you know, actually it's probably. I have stand on that. I got it. This thing did I too. Actually,"
4159.879999999999,4164.2," you know, let's roll one past Halo. Okay. Well, then let's roll one past Halo. Yeah, because in the"
4164.2,4168.28, shit ain't work. I wanted to read a piece of mail. We'll not piece of mail. We'll just a post from our
4168.28,4173.48," board today from there. Did you did you want to read it? Yeah, you read it this time. I'm not going to do it in"
4173.48,4178.28," the voice or anything. It's just funny on it. Yeah, this is an on-braided talk. This was great. And I"
4178.28,4185.08, had mentioned this before because he he was one who's responsible. It reminds me now. I need to bring back
4185.08,4192.68, heroes of the web. That will we'll make that come back next week. He's one of the dudes who he privately
4192.68,4197.72," message me and he sounded so sincere. He's like, you know, I work in this Delhi and it's a shit hole."
4197.72,4202.84," And I listen to that, you know, when I'm working and it makes that day so much fun. So anyway, this is the"
4202.84,4208.68, Delhi guy. Shout out to you. Says there's an understanding between my girlfriend and I that GFW
4208.68,4213.72," is something I do by myself. It's private time. 234. The Jack, you still rocked the podcast during"
4213.72,4219.72," work, but the man literally an old fat white bald man came. Got me listening to it and he made my"
4219.72,4225.0, boss stop stop my ear party at once. Sure he was the doctor of the Delhi for the fucking
4225.0,4233.64," direction. You know, sorry. I paste this right off of the the board. So here's the director of"
4233.64,4237.96," the Delhi's fucking region, but man, I did not need to use my right ear as I was elbow deep cleaning"
4237.96,4242.2, a fryer. I mean eight hours in the kitchen stepping poultry through the ass and metal skewers
4242.2,4248.44, does not require an awesome sense of hearing. What they do shit. That's what I'm talking about.
4248.44,4252.92," That's what I just like the idea. Well, I don't like the idea of that guy not being a little"
4252.92,4258.84," sneaky. If he's listening to this now, you should you should put your boss on the put your"
4258.84,4263.08," boss on your headphones right now. This is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of Gainesville in"
4263.08,4267.88, those magazine. Your your employee has a really tough job and he's working hard for you and he's
4267.88,4271.88, trying to do well. So let him listen to our fucking podcast. Okay. Okay. What is he
4271.88,4276.28," handing his chicken ass? He's sticking his hands up chicken ass is for eight hours. Yeah, you"
4276.28,4281.08, thought a lot of them have a little fun. Got damn it. You fucking fast fucking douchey.
4282.92,4290.4400000000005, That was Derek. That was Derek. I'm adopting a little more respectful. That's got the guy fired.
4291.0,4297.639999999999," All right. Overkill. He's like, okay, this Jeff Green customer is pretty funny. I see why he"
4297.639999999999,4304.5199999999995," listens to the show. Oh, get out. I'm pretty jack. I should take me later. Call this attorney."
4306.12,4309.96, So did we have any more mail? No. What about the red one?
4309.96,4314.44, Optimus. No. We'll see him for next time. Which one? The the the the the the red one. The
4314.44,4320.44," red one. Oh, that was the one that started. That this kind of the go ahead read if you want. Yeah."
4320.44,4324.919999999999," No, actually, I mean, it's just kind of like one of those he wasn't either guy who asked us about if we got"
4325.799999999999,4330.44," personally affected by. No, he started the third in this case. He started the"
4330.44,4335.16," regulators if listening to the show makes you at nerd. The answer of course is yes, but the"
4335.16,4340.5199999999995," guy asking, I mean, the guy appointment, of course, I don't think it's his avatar is really him,"
4340.52,4344.92, but it's like a fat ball guy in a cardboard box that's supposed to be painted like a transformer.
4344.92,4350.4400000000005, Optimus prime dude was like doing like it didn't really take our radio show to push you over the
4350.4400000000005,4357.72," edge. But so yeah, he just he post okay with Sarah quick. He he asked everyone maybe you can answer."
4357.72,4360.040000000001," Yeah, that's what I should like try to have a general question."
4361.88,4366.360000000001," Yeah, but the the the expensive making the show even more self-referential than it is. So he says,"
4366.36,4370.679999999999, I normally listen to GFW radio work today. I listen to after work when my girlfriend went out shopping
4370.679999999999,4375.88," and hung behind me. So when I attempt to enlighten my girlfriend and hopefully get her hooked on the podcast,"
4376.759999999999,4382.28," I hooked it up to the radio. After the champion of the web, we arrived at the first store,"
4382.28,4386.36," turned the radio off and she looked over at me and said, okay, now you're officially a dark."
4386.839999999999,4391.24," Anyway, I guess GFW radio will continue to be something as you buy myself. It beats going back to"
4391.24,4395.88," doing other things by myself. And you know, some stories of GFW haters. Let's share our pain."
4396.5199999999995,4400.12," So yeah, I took her that long to figure out the outfit. But it's like,"
4400.12,4404.759999999999, I don't even let my own girlfriend listen right. I don't know what she's my wife. Why are you trying to get your girlfriend
4404.759999999999,4409.24, to listen to this? Right. I never let my wife. How can you possibly explain how in the act? You possibly
4409.24,4413.24, imagine that this is going to be entertaining to your girlfriend. I spent all these years trying to convince
4413.24,4417.639999999999," sorry. My wife that I do I actually work and then she'll let you listen to this and she's like, what the hell"
4417.639999999999,4422.04," do you got it is do all day? Right. I know I always come home and say, I had the podcast today."
4422.04,4426.2," And now I got imagine in her mind she's thinking we're sitting around some of my conference table with, you know,"
4426.44,4430.599999999999," news stories like, you know, because she's sitting like NPR, I don't let her hear it. So actually,"
4430.599999999999,4434.2, things were talking about Bosnia or something. It's right here talking about skin fluids.
4434.2,4437.0," Her picture, her picture, her picture, her picture, her picture, her picture, her picture, her picture,"
4437.0,4441.24," in the girlfriend's ear. That's pretty much what's going on. You know, once in a while changes from her"
4441.24,4452.04," picture, but it's kind of like your dog listening to you talk. I think you just distilled it to"
4452.12,4456.68," its essence and it's like, that's for the haters to quote me on that. I just like,"
4456.68,4463.08," you're the best summary of my own bullshit. And there's your, you're the man now dog,"
4463.08,4468.28, I'm a sound by it. Yeah. So all right. Oh yeah. I'm going to yeah. We're going to let Ryan catch
4468.28,4477.8," its train. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll be back in a week with a lot more. Yeah. Well, I have some fun surprises."
4477.8,4481.16," We got I can tell you that right up. Actually, they're going to surprise us if I tell you they're"
4481.48,4486.76, coming up. But forget I said that nothing. All these got nothing. It would be nothing next week.
