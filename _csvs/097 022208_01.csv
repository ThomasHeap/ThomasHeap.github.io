0.0,6.4," Hey there, this is American McGee. Welcome you to American McGee's GFW"
6.4,10.16," Brodyo, presented by American McGee."
10.16,13.64, Well done guys.
13.64,14.64," Right, American McGee."
14.64,15.64, Yeah.
15.64,16.64, Killin it.
16.64,17.64," Sorry, it was a bit."
17.64,18.64, Thank you for presenting us.
18.64,20.12, That's quite all right.
20.12,21.44, That's what I'm here for.
21.44,24.64," And by the way, this might be an indicator that you suck."
24.64,26.64, So watch out.
26.64,29.48, People might be turning off the radio right now.
29.48,30.48, Yeah.
30.48,31.48, Where's that?
31.48,32.480000000000004, Oh wow.
32.480000000000004,33.480000000000004, Yeah.
33.480000000000004,34.480000000000004, You got some self-esteem issues there.
34.480000000000004,35.480000000000004," Hey, you know."
35.480000000000004,36.480000000000004, It's okay.
36.480000000000004,38.480000000000004, I did something bad.
38.480000000000004,40.480000000000004," You know, got some making up to do."
40.480000000000004,41.480000000000004, Yeah.
41.480000000000004,42.480000000000004, What was the bad that you did?
42.480000000000004,45.480000000000004," Well, I think we all know what the bad was."
45.480000000000004,47.480000000000004, And it was the bad daily.
47.480000000000004,51.480000000000004," Yeah, you know, when we walked in here in the studio, I said, the last time I saw you"
51.480000000000004,53.480000000000004, bad daily was a gleam in your eye.
53.480000000000004,57.480000000000004," Yeah, and I said, I wish it had stayed there."
57.48,59.48," Yeah, you're so hard in yourself."
59.48,60.48, Yeah.
60.48,64.47999999999999," Well, you know, I've been told by a number of people that, you know, we all make mistakes."
64.47999999999999,66.47999999999999, And it happens.
66.47999999999999,67.47999999999999," And, uh, and sure."
67.47999999999999,70.47999999999999," But, um, at the same time, it did suck."
70.47999999999999,73.47999999999999," And it was, and a lot of ways kind of a sucky experience."
73.47999999999999,75.47999999999999," But, um, so, do you actually feel like it sucked?"
75.47999999999999,76.47999999999999," I mean, does that how you feel personally?"
76.47999999999999,79.47999999999999, I feel like I feel like I feel like I feel like the execution of it.
79.47999999999999,80.47999999999999," Obviously was, was pretty lacking."
80.47999999999999,82.47999999999999, We thought we started off with a fun idea.
82.47999999999999,86.47999999999999," Um, and we thought that the idea of lampooning American fear culture had some"
86.48,88.48, merit to it.
88.48,92.48," Um, I think looking back on that, the truth is we don't want to make fun of ourselves."
92.48,98.48, And about an issue as delicate and obviously still heated as that one in particular.
98.48,101.48, People have a hard time finding humor in it.
101.48,105.48," And at least, uh, you know, in the way that I wrote it."
105.48,107.48," That's, you know, let's put it that way."
107.48,109.48," Um, but I think the concept has some merit."
109.48,112.48," I just saw that there's this trailer for a movie called Handcock, which is, uh,"
112.48,117.48, Will Smith as a homeless superhero living on the streets of Los Angeles.
117.48,118.48, Wow.
118.48,121.48," So, you know, there might be something there."
121.48,123.48," Um, it was a copy right to lawsuit, maybe."
123.48,125.48," Nah, that's totally cool."
125.48,126.48, Give me the timing.
126.48,127.48, Which is just off.
127.48,128.48000000000002," Well, there was a lot of people here."
128.48000000000002,129.48000000000002, There was a lot off.
129.48000000000002,132.48000000000002," Um, you know, I started writing up this post about what went wrong."
132.48000000000002,136.48000000000002," Um, and one thing that went wrong was the, this technology we were using."
136.48000000000002,138.48000000000002," Uh, these guys, it was fifth generation."
138.48,145.48," And it had started off as a 2D top down engine, uh, which that company had used to do simulation"
145.48,149.48," games, um, to the effect of like a theme park simulator, that kind of stuff."
149.48,151.48, And it had gone through these iterations.
151.48,156.48," And, you know, at one point it was a Joan of Arc game, 3D isometric view."
156.48,159.48," And then when we got our hands on it, they said, yeah, yeah, fine."
159.48,163.48," We'll repurpose this little become your 3D, you know, 3rd person run around adventure game."
163.48,166.48," And, you know, there were times when we were trying to tune the NPCs."
166.48,167.48," And I'd say, what's that guy doing?"
167.48,169.48," And they'd be like, oh, he's trying to feed the dolphins."
169.48,172.48," You know, he's over by a tree in the middle of Los Angeles."
172.48,174.48," And, wow, okay."
174.48,179.98," So there was a lot of legacy stuff in this, um, you know, one of the goals there was that we were"
179.98,184.48, going to make this thing on the cheap and ended up being that the whole game cost less than a million bucks.
184.48,188.48," We were trying to market it as this sort of casual, fun, you know, silly thing."
188.48,192.48," And I think that the market kind of said, now we're expecting the next Alice."
192.48,195.48," And so you made that in Hong Kong, right?"
195.48,196.48, That's right.
196.48,200.48," So I mean, were you already feeling like a cultural outsider to America at the time?"
200.48,203.48, And was that part of the thematic thing?
203.48,209.48," And then also is this refurbished over and over again, engine was that something unique to Hong"
209.48,210.48, Development at the time?
210.48,213.48, Or is that pretty common throughout game design across the world?
213.48,216.48," Uh, so the first question was I feeling alienating?"
216.48,218.48," Yeah, were you feeling like an outsider already?"
218.48,222.48," I mean, you're talking about, you know, maybe maybe it wasn't the right time or the,"
222.48,227.48," necessarily the right approach in your sort of, you know, parody, right of, you know, Western"
227.48,229.48, Cultures of fear.
229.48,234.48," And I mean, do you think it, I mean, had you been overseas long enough where, you know, you were like,"
234.48,239.48," Looking back and you're, where you had come from with a different point of view of that?"
239.48,245.48," Well, I think before I went to Hong Kong, I already had this outside point of view in politics that"
245.48,248.48, really did have something to do with my leaving at that time.
248.48,249.48, I was really fed up.
249.48,254.48, I kind of couldn't understand why people didn't see what seemed to be so obvious at that
254.48,259.48," time about where the world was, where the US was in its place in the world."
259.48,264.48," Um, and so I thought this was something we could try to present as a game."
264.48,268.48," Um, being there in Hong Kong didn't really have an effect on it."
268.48,273.48," Although while I was making it, I was concerned that people would say, well, you ran away to Hong Kong"
273.48,275.48, to make this statement about the place you came from.
275.48,280.48," Although, I think because of my name, people don't generally, people question."
280.48,287.48," Um, yeah, I was joking with my friend RJ was the executive producer on Alice about the name thing."
287.48,292.48," I was saying maybe when I retire from games, I can go into politics because it's so childish these days,"
292.48,297.48, the way politics and the state's work that I could probably go quite far with this silly name.
297.48,298.48, Right.
298.48,302.48," And when people try to question my loyalty to the state, I'd be like, hey, my name's American."
302.48,303.48," What's your name, buddy?"
303.48,307.48," Yeah, you know, just end it right there. What you're American."
307.48,314.48, I was looking at the San Francisco Chronicle the other day and there was this little article on this dude is local barrier guy
314.48,318.48, who's running for office for a small office and his name is Joe Nation.
318.48,319.48, There you go.
319.48,323.48, And I thought this guy is a winner and he looks like Joe nation.
323.48,325.48, Who would have vote for Joe nation?
325.48,326.48, So me.
326.48,331.48, It's the same time we have a Barack Obama as a presidential candidate.
331.48,335.48," Yeah, right. And since I was a young, the other way up with the great, you know, point case."
335.48,338.48," I mean, the, what's your name crazy woman and culture?"
338.48,342.48," Yeah, constantly refers to him as, as Hussein Obama."
342.48,345.48, Right. Why not why not go the full line and call that Hussein Osama?
345.48,347.48," You know, he probably loved to."
347.48,349.48," Well, see, it's a shrill and sane bitch."
349.48,350.48, So yeah.
353.48,357.48, So the other question was about just refurbishing an engine to such an extent.
357.48,359.48," Is that, is that, is that common throughout games?"
359.48,363.48," You know, we were again, we were trying to make a game on a budget with a public, a"
363.48,367.48," budget, a developer slash publisher."
367.48,372.48," And, you know, I didn't know going into this thing that it was going to turn into what it was."
372.48,375.48, I signed on to initially give them just a design document.
375.48,379.48," And I kind of thought, hey, you guys maybe want to buy it off something small."
379.48,384.48, I gave them a concept for a physics simulation disaster simulator.
384.48,388.48, You put an old woman in the shopping cart and push it down the hill and see how many points you get kind of stuff.
389.48,394.48," And they want, they wanted story, they wanted adventure, they wanted third floor motivation for pushing the lady."
394.48,395.48, Yeah.
395.48,401.48," But you know what I, what I discovered as I got closer and closer to the team and to the project."
401.48,406.48, And I eventually moved out to Hong Kong in the hopes that I could try to steer it one way or another.
406.48,411.48," Was that this guy, these guys, the team, they had their hearts fully in this thing."
411.48,415.48," But the guy funding it, you know, he was kind of notorious for how cheap he was."
416.48,420.48," They would work overtime, but at six o'clock and night he would turn off the air conditioning."
420.48,424.48, This is in Hong Kong where it's 90 degrees outside and a hundred percent of humidity.
424.48,428.48, And so you've got an office full of Chinese dudes in there underwear trying to get the game going.
428.48,431.48," And that wasn't a pretty sight, you know."
431.48,436.48," But if you feel guilty at that point, I felt disheartened."
436.48,444.48," I felt, you know, that between myself and my art director who is another expat, another guy living in Hong Kong from Australia."
444.48,448.48, We were just trying to do all we could to sort of hold it together.
448.48,456.48, To try to put some sort of sense into all the effort that these guys were putting into their work.
456.48,458.48, They were trying really hard.
458.48,463.48, It's just they were saddled with bad tech and not enough resources.
463.48,466.48," And so, you know, we got what we got."
466.48,470.48," So, what, at what point did you decide to move to Shanghai?"
471.48,481.48," Well, I'd been traveling to Shanghai on and off for the two years that I was in Hong Kong and checking out the scene there and seeing what we might want to, you know, try to build."
481.48,490.48," The idea always having been to try to start a studio to get IP going and, you know, as bad day I lay wrapped up."
490.48,493.48, I actually went to work writing on a film script for the Oz film.
494.48,504.48, I spent a year just kind of chilling out and doing that and then sort of cultivating business in Shanghai while we got the the grim deal going with game tab.
504.48,511.48," And off to Shanghai we went to start that we went from, in this last year we went from myself and my art director Ken."
511.48,514.48, He's been around working with us for years.
514.48,522.48, Two guys in Hong Kong pitching a concept to game tab to we now have almost 50 people around Shanghai Los Angeles and San Francisco.
522.48,535.48, Working on grim growing a company in a year from nothing in China and then also I mean you were playing the game today getting this game going with this bizarre.
535.48,540.48, Development cycle and you know concept and it's just been great it's been really fun.
540.48,547.48, So is it being published by just distributed by game tap is that primary the only way you're going to be able to get it is through game tap.
547.48,551.48, That's the only way you're going to be able to get it that we're talking about right now.
551.48,552.48, Aha.
552.48,553.48, Yeah.
553.48,555.48, This is there baby.
555.48,557.48," This is, you know, there."
557.48,560.48," You know, the studio that we've been building."
560.48,566.48, I mean this is all on their dime and it means a lot to us that they've given us a chance to build something.
566.48,569.48, They're in China and to build something so radical.
569.48,573.48," And so yeah, it's going out on their system to start with and then we'll see where it goes from there."
573.48,577.48," What are, what are some of the unique challenges with working, you know, in these overseas studios."
577.48,578.48, I'm sure they're tons and tons.
578.48,581.48, One that you mentioned in an email interview with me.
581.48,584.48, I'm not sure I could pronounce any where I was with my phone.
584.48,585.48, My phone.
585.48,586.48, Uh huh.
586.48,588.48, So if you can tell us a little bit about that.
588.48,590.48," No, well, and then then then whatever else."
590.48,593.48, And even even in the Hong Kong party or story to you.
593.48,595.48, I mean just how crazy things get.
595.48,601.48," Hong Kong is sort of a subset of China in terms of the difficulty because of the, you know,"
601.48,603.48, decades of British rule that they had.
603.48,609.48, There's a lot more civility to the way that they do business and they conduct their personal affairs.
609.48,612.48, Whereas China has always been a little bit wild.
612.48,616.48," There's not a lot to, there's not such thing as mismanters in China."
616.48,617.48, Let's just put it that way.
617.48,621.48, And Mothon is a concept that is is really prevalent.
621.48,624.48," You actually, the word means trouble or hassle."
624.48,629.48," You might use it to say, excuse me, Mothonni may, may I trouble you."
629.48,635.48, But then you also use it to refer to just every other like crazy fucking shit that just happens constantly.
635.48,644.48," It's just really, I don't think to anybody that hasn't been there trying to build something that it would really make sense."
644.48,654.48," Uh, it seems that path of most resistance is what's drilled into many, many aspects of government and banking and just everything."
654.48,658.48, It's a tough bureaucratic frustration.
658.48,666.48," There's a bureaucratic, but also there's this concept there that the nail that sticks up gets the hammer."
666.48,672.48, So the person who stands out or who steps out of line is going to get crushed.
672.48,684.48," So that means that as a culture, there's this idea that being different or having original ideas or having an original thought is not something you want to do."
684.48,692.48," And, you know, so we see this happening, not so much with our core team, but you know, when we work without sources and things like that,"
692.48,701.48, where they're not motivated or maybe incentivized to think outside the box that you can put people to work on something and they'll just do the most counterintuitive thing.
701.48,707.48," And then continue to do it until someone comes along and says, wait a second, why are you doing,"
707.48,715.48," but with an example of what the counterintuitive things that they're going on and then you step in and sort of horror and say, that wasn't what I had mind."
715.48,727.48," Yeah, there's, um, I'm just trying to think of an example, we've had recently, you know, an example might be that you set someone to work on building a particular kind of an asset."
727.48,736.48," They don't quite know how to do it, but they then begin to do that and then they just keep repeating it with subsequent assets and so you end up with a whole pile of assets you can't use."
736.48,746.48," And the type of mistake being made is the kind of thing that would have triggered, you know, someone not afraid of raising their hand to say, this doesn't feel right."
746.48,753.48," Maybe I shouldn't be building this asset like this, maybe something very obvious, and yet there's none of that triggering going on."
753.48,765.48," This is weird because this, I mean, there, you know, an oxidautilism and orientalism, I mean, there are these longstanding notions of me previously was a Japanese culture part of the Second World War that."
765.48,778.48," The servility and all these other things, but, you know, western, you know, history and other academia and stuff is largely tried to say, well, these were all."
778.48,783.48, Just the West projecting or assuming the wrong things about these cultures.
783.48,790.48," Is it taken, I mean, among the people that you work with there, is it accepted? Is that reading of the culture accepted?"
790.48,793.48, It's circulated among Chinese themselves.
793.48,799.48," You mean, do they have just awareness? Just the social and cultural traits and the fact that it's things are more difficult there."
799.48,805.48," Right, or which would it, which is a personal characterized themselves as being not inclined to be different."
805.48,807.48, This is my view as an outsider.
808.48,833.48," After you've spent enough time there, you have this sort of transcendental moment where what we perceive to be chaos becomes this alternate and very functional system of people being able to move about in a state that to us seems really like a bad idea, cars and traffic and people, ideas mixing together very chaotically with no, you know, discernible pattern."
833.48,840.48, And yet they as a society clearly have been around for quite some time and managing themselves with absolutely no problem.
840.48,850.48," So there comes a moment where you realize, oh, you know, what I perceive to be chaos and maybe out of control is just the way they do it."
850.48,856.48," And so I think for Chinese people who've been to the US, they see, wow, everybody stands in line."
856.48,860.48," And wow, if I turn my turn signal on, the guy behind me might actually let me in."
860.48,864.48," Wow, if I'm walking across the street cars don't purposely try to run me over."
864.48,874.48," You know, then go back to China, they'll go, oh, now I get why those foreigners come here and pull all their hair out because there is a very dramatic difference."
874.48,878.48, Sounds like super heated atoms colliding and like plasma or something.
878.48,881.48," It's, you know, you just have to be there to see it."
881.48,886.48," We were joking the other day about the, to get your driver's license there."
886.48,895.48," The, the translation of the driving test into English, you know, and it says something like when driving down it and it's a 500 question thing when driving down a residential street."
895.48,901.48," In order to allow, you know, make sure you don't hit pedestrians residents of that area."
901.48,913.48," What do you do? And it's a, honk, b, honk quietly, c, honk many, many times or d, press the horn and hold it down while going, you know,"
913.48,919.48, and one of these is actually a valid option. You're supposed to like honk as you're going down to everyone honks like crazy.
919.48,925.48," You know, pedestrians have no right of way. If you step out into the street and they will run you over."
925.48,926.48, That's awesome.
926.48,927.48, That's how it should be.
927.48,928.48, The bad day shank.
928.48,929.48, Yeah.
929.48,935.48," But you know, into our perception of this, it's madness and yet it completely functions."
935.48,939.48," But even in Western culture, I mean, obviously this is more extreme because,"
939.48,946.48," you know, you can go across the country and see those kind of differences in the way people act in traffic or the way people act in trains."
946.48,958.48," And I remember when you're a Disney first opened in outside of Paris, the biggest problem that they had that Disney had that they weren't anticipating was the fact that they had built the park."
958.48,964.48," And they had built the lines, the cues for the, for the rides based on how they had done it in America."
964.48,970.48, And then they opened the park in France and found out where Europeans don't stand in line in an orderly way.
970.48,972.48, They just rushed to the thing.
972.48,975.48," And they couldn't deal with that, they were not prepared for that."
975.48,978.48, Just this cultural difference of how you stand in life or don't.
978.48,982.48," Yeah. The cues in China oftentimes they, it's like cattle corrals."
982.48,987.48," It'll start off as a very big wedge with a wide open end, so you can rush towards it."
987.48,993.48," But then as you move up the cue, it narrows and narrows to the point where they make it so narrow."
993.48,1002.48," That perhaps your average American, you know, a wide body, your average American would not be able to fit."
1002.48,1003.48," Oh, you see."
1003.48,1006.48," You know, would not be able to fit into the cue line."
1006.48,1008.48, So they're sort of funneling people in.
1008.48,1014.48," And it's amazing to see how, you know, all the way up to the funnel point, these, you know, they're crawling over each other."
1014.48,1022.48," They're pushing and shoving and, you know, you take for granted for one moment that some little granny, you know, Chinese woman isn't going to try to,"
1022.48,1030.48," try to protect her position and you'll get it in the nuts. You're just like that. You're just, you know, elbow, knees just over."
1030.48,1035.48," Are you, are you long past the point where you're taking pictures of all this sort of thing and like telling yourself,"
1035.48,1039.48," This isn't normal or you know, in the point where this is just how things go."
1039.48,1041.48," And then when you come back here, like you're out here for GDC."
1041.48,1043.48," Yeah, I, it's a trip to do that."
1043.48,1046.48, I know that it's a strange existence.
1046.48,1048.48," You know, I write a bicycle to work every day."
1048.48,1054.48," And I am in the street in the society, speaking the language."
1054.48,1062.48," And it has sort of lost some of its strangeness, but there's still always a moment where, you know, I might accidentally turn,"
1062.48,1065.48, or try to explore a faster way to get to the office turned on an alley.
1065.48,1071.48," And suddenly find myself, you know, driving through fresh produce and fish market at six o'clock in the morning."
1071.48,1077.48," And then go, holy shit, I'm in China, you know, and just have these moments."
1078.48,1087.48," Another good one is, you know, having some decadent meal on the bund, which is the part of Shanghai out down by the river, where there's a lot of the older buildings."
1087.48,1097.48," And looking out and seeing the communist flag flying over, you know, China and having this very western meal and thinking again, holy shit out of China."
1097.48,1101.48," So you, you have moments, definitely moments where you wake up to it."
1101.48,1104.48, Are you making grim for a Chinese audience as well?
1104.48,1106.48, Is it worldwide audience?
1106.48,1111.48," We are, well, it's going to hopefully apply worldwide."
1111.48,1118.48," I was just talking with Ricardo Sanchez, who's the VP of content about the idea that we want to do a Chinese episode."
1118.48,1127.48," I can't say the name of the story or Wendy there will kill me, but the idea was that we would present the entire episode in Chinese."
1127.48,1131.48, So all the Vio we record in Chinese and then we'll do English subtitles.
1131.48,1141.48," And this is as much, you know, I think going to be fun for the western audience to watch as it is that our Chinese team really wants to make a Chinese episode."
1141.48,1143.48, So that should be really cool.
1143.48,1152.48," Which is kind of what I was wanting to get at in there is that when you have your creative teams over there, I mean, are they satisfied making games for foreign audiences?"
1152.48,1158.48," Do they want to see a strong, you know, national sort of game development character?"
1159.48,1165.48," Well, our team is having a blast. What we've found is that, you know, before their options for where they might work in Shanghai, we're really limited."
1165.48,1175.48," It was either Ubisoft or go work for one of the big Chinese corporations. And at Ub, a lot of the guys we have came from there, they were handed a piece of paper with a design on it and told create this."
1175.48,1180.48," So they felt very marginalized. They felt like a machine or a cog in the, in the machine."
1180.48,1185.48, And they weren't really allowed to make any kind of creative decisions about the product they were making.
1185.48,1188.48, Compare that with what we do with grim. We have very open design meetings.
1188.48,1194.48," And then once the design has been fleshed out by the team, we give that over to the designers, to the level designers."
1194.48,1200.48," And we tell them, go nuts. The, the whackier you make it, the cooler you make it, the more you make it yours, the better."
1200.48,1211.48," So they have a lot of freedom. And it was funny. Early on, they were kind of scratching their heads and a freight of this. They kept asking, hey, maybe you could give us, you know, more stuff to lay out."
1211.48,1221.48," But then one by one, they started seeing their co-workers, oh, dude, did you just see what this guy sun did? He went completely nuts and did something original."
1221.48,1227.48," And then all of a sudden, they all started going, we can all do something original. So that's, that's been great."
1227.48,1233.48," You know, the alternative on the Chinese side is that a lot of these big Chinese corporations have the little emperor problem,"
1233.48,1236.48, where a team might be working on an MMO for a year.
1236.48,1245.48," And suddenly the guy who is the nephew of the guy who owns the company will come in and go, all right, this game, you've been working on it all needs to be turtles now, or it all needs to be."
1245.48,1255.48," And we'll just completely and radically change the direction of the game day by day or month by month. And so again, they feel like they don't have any say or control and what they're building."
1255.48,1264.48," It's got to be an interesting subject matter to work with, too, because, I mean, obviously everyone in the last year knows that, you know, Rupple still, it's can store it in all these, is this something that's,"
1264.48,1271.48," or they know, you know, little red, red, red in hood is a Shao Huang Mal, the little red cap and they know little red cap."
1271.48,1286.48," They know a lot of these stories and a lot of the stories we're dealing with, I think even Western audiences may not, they, they'd need to be reminded of them, you know, there's things like Godfather death and now I'm just spacing out on some of them, the more weird ones."
1286.48,1296.48," We're a girl without hands and the boy who went forth to learn what fear is and these are stories that have a lot of cool content in them, but that, you know, weren't Disneyified so much."
1296.48,1301.48," So, they, they're, you know, they're having fun, we translate them, they get it, they get the humor."
1301.48,1310.48," Are there any stories that you, you know, one particular version of them, you start telling half of it and then their version is suddenly completely divergent."
1310.48,1320.48," So that's the point of the game is that a lot of these grimst fairy tales, they started an oral tradition, red riding hood is a great example of a story that has no formal route in writing."
1320.48,1329.48," It started off thousands and thousands of years ago as a, as a story told around the campfire and then became codified in many cultures."
1329.48,1335.48, That's why the Chinese have a version of it. That's why the Europeans have a version of the American Indians have a version of it.
1335.48,1344.48," These are very classic themes and when we're dealing with it, what we try to do is because of the format of the game, it's like a TV show."
1344.48,1353.48," It's presented in three pieces, a puppet theater which tells you the most Disney version of the story we could either find or we could make up."
1353.48,1358.48, We then allow the player to run through the game and change this environment to make everything really dark.
1358.48,1363.48, And then there's a final presentation of the grimst version of this story.
1363.48,1369.48," You know, an example might be that in the Pinocchio that we all know from Disney, there's a character known as Germany cricket."
1369.48,1374.48," He exists in the books, but in the books Pinocchio murders the cricket."
1374.48,1380.48," You know, Cinderella, the Indian of that story, they all live happily ever after in the original story."
1380.48,1384.48, The eyes are plucked out of her family's heads by birds.
1385.48,1387.48," So, you know, that first."
1387.48,1388.48, It's awesome.
1388.48,1397.48, So that diversity in the story is actually key to creating contrast that we then use to create gameplay.
1397.48,1404.48," So in some way, when you, to give some people a synopsis of it, I mean, you play the character grim."
1404.48,1411.48," Who acts is the embodiment of a paintbrush or a reverse Mario Sunshine rather than going around with the squirt pack,"
1411.48,1416.48," cleaning things up, you walk around and you put your thigh, turn everything, you know, disgusting."
1416.48,1425.48," Is this kind of like a way of undoing the sensors for because, like, you know, with the grimst brothers, tails, when their versions are more collected."
1425.48,1432.48," Various, you know, phases of censorship happen over them to get to the versions of these that we know now in America."
1432.48,1435.48, Is this kind of like a way of undoing that?
1435.48,1436.48," I mean, like, what's going on?"
1436.48,1443.48," Well, Grim's point is that without teeth, these stories don't mean anything that their original purpose was to teach us something."
1443.48,1446.48," Don't talk to strangers, you know, don't walk alone in the woods."
1446.48,1452.48," I mean, whatever the moral of these stories might have been by taking out the threat you destroy the meaning."
1452.48,1460.48," So he, as the presenter of this show is saying to us, all right, boys and girls, this week, we're going to look at Cinderella."
1460.48,1474.48," And in the light version, he'll scoff at it and say, this sucks, you know, and at the end of each telling, he always invites the player by saying, you know, this is the version, you know, the sort of Disney version."
1474.48,1477.48, If you think there should be a better version than this than play on.
1477.48,1483.48," And so you're brought in and then coming into the dark and theater, he goes, that's more like it."
1483.48,1485.48, Now we have the story as it should be.
1485.48,1488.48," Let's see these guys get their just desserts, you know."
1489.48,1504.48," Do you see, sort of like a native games movement coming out of China in the way that, you know, where you where you have Japanese, your games have, I've got to stamp on them, Korean, games more recently, or is it already there to some extent."
1504.48,1514.48," You know, I think to date, the Chinese games industry has mostly been about taking safe bets, which translates to copying what's come before."
1514.48,1521.48," They're like I said, haven't been any shops where someone could exercise true creativity or virginality."
1521.48,1535.48," And you know, we're certainly hoping that, you know, we're going to be doing projects in the future where our Chinese designers are given access to our Western concept artists, for instance, and told GoCrazi and make something truly unique."
1535.48,1547.48," I think once that starts to happen, people are given really given true freedom to design stuff, then we might be in a place where we're seeing more true Chinese content built by Chinese teams."
1547.48,1554.48," How much oversight is there from the Chinese government for stuff that's made for, you know, indigenous audience."
1554.48,1559.48," You mean in terms of releasing it, you mean just like, yeah, maybe we're off a sentence."
1559.48,1571.48," Like, say if you're going to, no, look at say you make a game for a Chinese market and release it and I mean when it comes to the point where someone's like are there, are there themes and messages in this game that we don't approve of."
1571.48,1574.48, I mean how iron is the fist.
1574.48,1588.48," You know, it's amazing people kind of had this misconception that it's oh god, it's communist China and you know, I get people, so they mean notes all the time of, you know, how's the repression and do you need me to send toothpaste or be odor and,"
1588.48,1603.48," you know, in fact, I feel safer, more secure and actually feel more free to go about doing what I want to do and being who I want to be in China, then I do and a lot of places I've been in the world often times America included."
1603.48,1612.48, I can go days in China without seeing a gun in the US. I walk out on the street and there's a gun on the hip of every cop on the street.
1612.48,1618.48," You know, I can go days in China without seeing people blow up at each other and get angry."
1618.48,1622.48," Here you cut someone off in traffic and you know, boom, I mean, it's not f**king you America."
1622.48,1625.48," Yeah, f**k, fuck, I'm American."
1625.48,1636.48, It's not to say it's perfect there and it's not to say that they have at the same time they have far more journalists and prison than any other country in the world to my knowledge right now.
1636.48,1638.48," Yeah, well we just kill our journalists."
1639.48,1641.48, I'm American. As we should.
1641.48,1657.48," As we should, you know, it's not a great place in a lot of respects, but at the same time there is a certain strange the government lets people do what they want to do because, you know, what there's so many people."
1657.48,1663.48," They know that to crack down too hard on any one thing, they wouldn't be able to control it."
1663.48,1679.48," But it's sort of managed chaos, you know, again, just I get what I was just getting is like, like you can make a game called bad LA in really Santa America and then it will be cynical and have, you know, various forms of commentary on America, but if you were to make a game in China that day bashing and you."
1679.48,1682.48, And it was a tank and it was pretty cool of right.
1682.48,1690.48," Yeah, or in it, and it, yeah, it brought up like you say a brought up 10 minutes square, but it, but made the go, you know, portray the government in a negative light."
1690.48,1695.48," Would that fly, is that possible? No, you would have a tough time with that. Okay."
1695.48,1709.48," You definitely have a tough time with that. You know, there's laws here. You can't make a game simulating killing the president in the US. I would imagine there's a lot of issues you might try to make a game out of here that you probably couldn't."
1709.48,1717.48," There's just people don't try to push those boundaries, same thing in China. They kind of question, well, why would I want to push that boundary? Why do I want to do Tieneman Square tank simulator?"
1718.48,1721.48, That sounds like it. I got to go.
1721.48,1725.48, I was going to get a bit rather riddle back. Is that a weak game?
1725.48,1726.48, It's not a weak game.
1729.48,1734.48, So you've had your name on many games and I asked this in the email interview.
1734.48,1741.48," And I didn't, I figured that your response that you can go in a greater depth. And it was basically what is an American McGee game?"
1741.48,1749.48," And why were so many guys like, you know, scared me about a won't have me about this Mario and all these other games? Why are your games still wearing your name?"
1749.48,1750.48, What is it?
1750.48,1760.48," You know, I've been thinking about this because I shouldn't, but I read comments when we put a trailer up and I see people going, what is this guy think he is?"
1760.48,1768.48," You know, it came down to this. I was sitting there thinking, okay, Joe, commenter."
1768.48,1776.48," Let's say that somebody came up to you tomorrow and said, you've nothing about games. You don't know anything about games at all of it. And you play games."
1776.48,1781.48," But guess what, Bob, we're going to give you $8 million to go make a game."
1781.48,1786.48," And by the way, the one caveat is you have to put your name on the box."
1786.48,1792.48," You know, that's the situation that I have in its sense because this is my living. This is my job."
1792.48,1796.48," And when these publishers come to me and they say, we want to make a game with you."
1796.48,1801.48," I think there's this idea that I say, no problem, but my name is going to box."
1801.48,1808.48," In fact, and you know, these guys can attest to this. I often say to them, this might not work out the way you want it to work out."
1808.48,1814.48, This is a very dangerous thing we're playing with here. There are the hardcore fans and there's the hardcore haters.
1814.48,1824.48," And the name, you know, I think it can work and I think it can come back and bite us. And so, but I'm not a part of that oftentimes."
1824.48,1831.48," I could say no, I'm not going to do this game because I don't want my name on the box, but turns out I like to eat and we're clothes and, you know,"
1831.48,1834.48, So you see how much of a cool name.
1834.48,1835.48," Oh, yeah."
1835.48,1840.48," Or hurts, right? I mean, if my name was just Bob, then they wouldn't be saying, hey, let's put Bob's name on the game."
1840.48,1850.48," So, you know, and I hope I don't sound like I'm bitching about the fact that this happens. I mean, certainly, okay, you know, it's not the worst thing in the world."
1850.48,1857.48," It would be much better thing if I felt like I deserved it a little bit more, right?"
1857.48,1866.48," I can be honest with myself and say, okay, put on a craft game, you know, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense, but I'm hoping that I'll put out some more good games."
1866.48,1870.48," And then people will say, I like the games this guy makes and then maybe it's worth something."
1870.48,1875.48," Sean, did you have, you know, some information about the Sid Myers name appearing on?"
1875.48,1878.48," Oh, well, yeah, I was similar to what we were saying. I mean, it's the marketing."
1878.48,1887.48," I mean, that's, you know, more ancient history, but the reason Sid Myers name was put on the box is mainly, like, from my understand, his marketing guy basically said,"
1887.48,1893.48," because he wanted to make pirates, and it was totally different than his other games, his audience might have known him for, so they were, they said,"
1893.48,1897.48," well, we put Sid Myers pirates, so people know if they're coming from this other audience, right?"
1897.48,1898.48, This is your game.
1898.48,1904.48," Well, this was exactly what happened on Alice. The marketing guys came into the room and they go, okay, here's the deal."
1904.48,1911.48," We're going to make Alice, we don't, and they had all these different names for Alice, Alice, and Nightmare land, Alice, who's looking at us, and they were all too worthy, and they said,"
1911.48,1917.48," well, we really want to capture the audience that we think you had when you made doom, and, you know, we were involved with this stuff."
1917.48,1922.48," And I, and I said, at that time, this sucks, I don't want to do this."
1922.48,1927.48," Gamers will say this isn't legitimate, and that, you know, we're, this is selling out or whatever you want to call it,"
1927.48,1930.48," and they were like, no, no, no, no, don't worry, trust us, it's fine."
1930.48,1934.48," And I, you know, focused on making the game, and at one point, they actually came in, they said,"
1934.48,1938.48," hey, guess what, American, we're not going to put your name on Alice, and I went to the team and I said,"
1938.48,1943.48," hey, team, great news, guess what, they're not going to put my name on Alice, and, like, two weeks later,"
1943.48,1947.48," I get another phone call and they're like, that name's back, and I'm like, you know what, now I got to go out there,"
1947.48,1952.48," it'd be like, guys, I was just kidding, it's mine again, so, yeah, whatever you guys are doing,"
1952.48,1959.48," doesn't, doesn't count, sorry, you know, then it's, it's just been weird since then, you know."
1959.48,1962.48," So, you know, it sounds like you might feel a little guilty when your name's on it, then,"
1962.48,1963.48," well, you know, it's a team effort."
1963.48,1970.48," It is a team effort, and I, every turn I try to go out of my way to, to make sure people know who it is that makes these things,"
1970.48,1974.48," you know, there's this quote of, you know, making yourself look smart by,"
1974.48,1979.48," surrounding yourself, by smart people kind of thing. So, I don't think I'm the smartest or greatest or any of these things,"
1979.48,1983.48," but I am fortunate, and that these people working at the company are really great artists,"
1983.48,1988.48," really great level designers, really great programmers, and they really do a great job."
1988.48,1993.48," And I guess at the end of the day, they're not bothered by it, so I try not to be too bothered by it,"
1993.48,1996.48, and it seems to work out all right.
1996.48,2001.48," I take it, you saw the recent mudsling in between Joan and Romero, and Wilson of GameConc."
2001.48,2004.48," I was pretty, yeah, which you make of that."
2004.48,2008.48," I was like, those crazy Americans, much went back to work."
2008.48,2010.48," Yeah, so you would not have to not be part of that, I'm sorry."
2010.48,2014.48," I don't want any part of that. That's good, that's healthy."
2014.48,2022.48," Yeah, it's, so I had a question about how, how grim came to be in terms of which came first,"
2022.48,2027.48," I don't know if it's going to be as simple as chicken and eggs scenario, but episodic or the concept."
2027.48,2030.48, Did you know that you wanted to make a episodic game first?
2030.48,2034.48," Well, I had been playing around at the concept of a character called Grim,"
2034.48,2039.48, and the idea that he had some kind of powers to make things dark in a fairy tale world.
2039.48,2043.48, I had actually written a tremendous amount of story about that.
2043.48,2048.48, There was versions where he was the Lost Athe Dwarf.
2048.48,2054.48," There's versions where there's this character who's sort of a Moses Lost character,"
2054.48,2057.48, who discovers he's got all this dark magic power to make things dark.
2057.48,2060.48," The game's app came along and they said, we want to do something."
2060.48,2061.48, We want it to be episodic.
2061.48,2066.48," And so I thought, well, let's try to figure out a way to adapt Grim into this."
2066.48,2072.48," And it started off with a loose narrative and a loose idea of the gameplay,"
2072.48,2075.48, but it was a very evolutionary thing.
2076.48,2079.48," It didn't really have a full form until we sort of prototype it,"
2079.48,2081.48, and this dwarf character kind of started to take form.
2081.48,2086.48," And so, you know, I think the egg was some story,"
2086.48,2088.48, but it was always about episodic.
2088.48,2091.48, It was always from day one we needed to do episodic.
2091.48,2097.48," It seems like one of the strengths of episodic would be that you can kind of adapt,"
2097.48,2099.48, depending on your player feedback.
2099.48,2101.48," And you've got a really interesting schedule,"
2101.48,2103.48, and that you're trying to do one of these a week.
2103.48,2106.48," Well, how far had you build them?"
2106.48,2108.48," And like, you have half the season ready when the first ones out,"
2108.48,2110.48, and then that way you can kind of...
2110.48,2112.48, Change your plan to think don't.
2112.48,2116.48, We will be quite ahead of the release schedule.
2116.48,2120.48," And, you know, we are building stuff,"
2120.48,2122.48," especially the landscapes,"
2122.48,2124.48, and putting the settings in place and things like that.
2124.48,2126.48, But we can always go back in and modify the gameplay.
2126.48,2130.48," We can always go back in and tighten things up, add new power-ups."
2130.48,2135.48, So there's definitely room to modify the game core game
2135.48,2138.48," without, you know, the landscapes having to change too much."
2138.48,2142.48," So we are hoping to take feedback, you know, as the first eight episodes go out,"
2142.48,2145.48, and then work that into the second group of eight episodes.
2145.48,2148.48, So what's the structure? It's eight at a time.
2148.48,2149.48," Eight, eight, eight."
2149.48,2151.48," Eight for, you know, once a week,"
2151.48,2155.48," and then a little break, and then eight, one a week, and then a little break."
2155.48,2157.48," You know, about the little break is going to be yours."
2157.48,2159.48, I don't know if we're even though we're doing it.
2159.48,2160.48," What it is, guy, yeah."
2160.48,2164.48," In episodic TV, in comic books, there's usually a few form,"
2164.48,2166.48," I mean, there's usually a few paths to take one,"
2166.48,2169.48," would be a show like Lost, where you build a story."
2169.48,2171.48," Someone's going to jump in five episodes in,"
2171.48,2173.48," isn't necessarily going to understand what's going on,"
2173.48,2175.48," or you've got like the Mat Lock or something,"
2175.48,2177.48," where each, the McIverMong."
2177.48,2179.48," Yeah, you could hop right in and get it."
2179.48,2182.48," Now, instead of the parallels and game in the game version of an episode,"
2182.48,2184.48," where the story is cumulative, I'm thinking about"
2185.48,2190.48," the actual gameplay, and, you know, the literacy with the move set and the options."
2190.48,2194.48," And for you, you mentioned that you wanted to be,"
2194.48,2197.48," you wanted to work in Grim, so that someone could pick up episode six,"
2197.48,2201.48," have never touched the others, and understand how to play it,"
2201.48,2203.48, and not be too challenged in this and that.
2203.48,2205.48," And I want to know how, is it difficult for you,"
2205.48,2207.48, is that frustrating and how are you dealing with that?
2207.48,2210.48," When you can't ever assume, especially if each episode is only about a half hour long,"
2210.48,2213.48," and you can't assume that I'm going to teach,"
2213.48,2216.48," because so many games spent so much time teaching people how to play them,"
2216.48,2219.48, and then they become fun after you go.
2219.48,2221.48," Well, you played through some of the stuff,"
2221.48,2222.48, it was afternoon.
2222.48,2225.48," It's all on one mouse, and it's two buttons."
2225.48,2227.48," There's run, there's jump, and there's a double jump,"
2227.48,2230.48," and it's like, kind of like a butt stomp."
2230.48,2235.48," And that's it, and to watch it played from the outside,"
2235.48,2238.48, it's kind of like watching someone play Catamari Dimasi.
2238.48,2240.48," It looks kind of interesting, but I'm not sure I get it,"
2240.48,2243.48," but then once you take the controls with Catamari, you're like,"
2243.48,2246.48," oh, this is fun, I'm rolling stuff up, and what we've heard"
2246.48,2249.48, is a very similar kind of response about grim.
2249.48,2252.48," Looking at it, it's kind of cool, he's making things dark,"
2252.48,2254.48," but then once you actually are behind the controls,"
2254.48,2257.48," and maybe you can be testament to this, I don't know."
2257.48,2259.48," It starts to be a little more interesting,"
2259.48,2261.48, because you're starting to be a part of all these transformations
2261.48,2263.48, that are taking place.
2263.48,2266.48," Tans your question, is this frustrating,"
2267.48,2270.48," or I'd say it's not frustrating, it's not challenging,"
2270.48,2275.48," it's a little bit scary, because we're breaking a lot of rules."
2275.48,2277.48," Not only about how we make the game,"
2277.48,2278.48," but how we're going to deliver the game,"
2278.48,2281.48, and how we expect the player to perceive the game.
2281.48,2284.48, And it means that a lot of rules would have to be broken down stream.
2284.48,2286.48," How do people talk about this game,"
2286.48,2289.48," how do they market it, how do gaming magazines or websites"
2289.48,2291.48, position this?
2291.48,2295.48," So I think it's going to be challenging for everybody,"
2295.48,2298.48," including the people playing it, but our hope is they go,"
2298.48,2300.48," oh, I love red, little red riding hood, I love Cinderella,"
2300.48,2302.48," I love Pinocchio, these things are classic,"
2302.48,2304.48," I want to be a part of this, I want to see what happens,"
2304.48,2306.48, and we've got pretty high hopes.
2306.48,2309.48," I could see the potential, my concern would be that"
2309.48,2311.48," if you, the worst case scenario would be,"
2311.48,2314.48," if you were to take a game like Super Mario Galaxy,"
2314.48,2316.48," I'm sure if you played it or not,"
2316.48,2319.48," but it's a lot more self-contained than some of the previous 3D Mario's,"
2319.48,2322.48," and each level will introduce some new,"
2323.48,2326.48," some new motif for game play mechanic,"
2326.48,2327.48," and then as soon as you learn it,"
2327.48,2328.48," then it moves onto something else,"
2328.48,2331.48," and it just keeps going, and then later on it will revisit those,"
2331.48,2334.48, and draw on the experience that you accumulate as you played.
2334.48,2337.48, And what I'll be worried is if every single level in a game
2337.48,2340.48," like that had to go back to square one and assume,"
2340.48,2343.48," we can't do this might be a little too much,"
2343.48,2346.48, because we can't assume people had that learning day.
2346.48,2349.48," Well, that period to learn and to acclimate themselves to the game."
2349.48,2351.48," At the end of the day, this may not work."
2351.48,2355.48," We have to face that, that there may not be an audience out there"
2355.48,2356.48, that wants to play this.
2356.48,2359.48," When we set out with the vision of the game,"
2359.48,2363.48," we arranged it, and this is going to maybe sound a little backwards."
2363.48,2364.48, Maybe it is.
2364.48,2366.48," We arranged it that story was out in front,"
2366.48,2370.48," and art style, and this transformation concept was second,"
2370.48,2372.48, and then the game play was third.
2372.48,2374.48, And that's not to say that gameplay was last.
2374.48,2376.48," I mean, there's a whole nother list of things behind,"
2376.48,2378.48," beyond that, that we thought we're interesting,"
2379.48,2384.48, but we wanted story and the transformation idea in the art to really come first.
2384.48,2388.48," So this is not a platformer, this is not an adventure,"
2388.48,2392.48," this is not an action shooter, it's all played in a very simple manner,"
2392.48,2394.48, and it may be too simplistic.
2394.48,2397.48," We're going to see, but until we get these episodes out there,"
2397.48,2399.48," and people start interacting with them, we'll never know."
2399.48,2403.48," And you know, I'd rather take the chance that we try it,"
2403.48,2407.48," and we try something new, and make it work,"
2407.48,2410.48, than just to keep doing the same thing over and over again.
2410.48,2412.48, So it's the weekly schedule given you enough time
2412.48,2416.48, to iterate based on your audience's feedback.
2416.48,2418.48," Well, we can, that's what I'm saying,"
2418.48,2422.48," the weekly schedule, we can go in and add minor tweaks"
2422.48,2428.48," for major things, it'll have to be, you know, later in the season,"
2428.48,2432.48," but, you know, week to week, we could go in and make minor adjustments."
2432.48,2435.48," So like if we release episodes one and two,"
2435.48,2438.48," and then people say, we don't like the run speed or the jump height,"
2438.48,2441.48," or some of these things that are kind of easily accessible,"
2441.48,2445.48, then we can go in there and make instant changes to that kind of stuff.
2445.48,2450.48," If people say, you know, this dynamic in general is, you know,"
2450.48,2453.48," lacking and needs more, then we might have to wait a couple of episodes"
2453.48,2456.48, to take those comments and suggestions and try to work them in.
2456.48,2461.48, We're hoping that it's an iterative process that we work with the audience on.
2461.48,2462.48, Right.
2462.48,2463.48, Skip.
2464.48,2466.48," Yeah, we're getting the cut off."
2466.48,2467.48, Okay.
2467.48,2468.48, Time here.
2468.48,2470.48," Does this guy even, like,"
2470.48,2472.48," you, you learn to quit?"
2472.48,2474.48, Usually it's one line per episode.
2474.48,2475.48, Okay.
2475.48,2477.48," But it's usually pretty, it's devastating."
2477.48,2478.48, I'm here.
2478.48,2479.48, Right.
2479.48,2480.48, Right.
2480.48,2481.48, Right.
2481.48,2483.48, Right.
2483.48,2486.48, I've just been listening in this whole time.
2486.48,2487.48, It's an interesting.
2487.48,2488.48, Okay.
2488.48,2490.48," But once you leave it, you need to go bullish."
2490.48,2491.48, I think I'm going nuts.
2491.48,2493.48, And I think I'm going to talk over these guys.
2493.48,2494.48, Yeah.
2494.48,2495.48, This is changed for the dynamic.
2495.48,2496.48," That's, that's sweet."
2496.48,2497.48, Thank you.
2497.48,2498.48, Yeah.
2498.48,2500.48, But thank you very much.
2500.48,2504.48," We do, it was Ryan's idea to have American introduce the show."
2504.48,2505.48, That's why I'm talking to you.
2505.48,2506.48, I'll talk to you.
2506.48,2509.48, Send us off with one of your classic hellyaz.
2509.48,2510.48, Huh?
2510.48,2513.48, And that's it.
