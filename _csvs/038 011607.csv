0.0,9.68," Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast. This is the podcast for January 16th, 16th,"
9.68,16.080000000000002," 16th, 2007. I do not know what the data is because I've been on my ass for two weeks with"
16.080000000000002,23.44," pneumonia and I'm finally back. Yay. I missed you. So since I was gone and came back, we"
23.44,28.2, find ourselves in a new room here. And Sean Malois has been mysteriously and sinisterly
28.279999999999998,34.36, replaced by Andrew Fister. True. That scares me. He's trying to subvert us as we made
34.36,37.32, photo of the what up yours. You're asking me. We can't make fun of him now. This
37.32,41.16, is because we have one of them in here. We were making fun of weird just trying to get in
41.16,47.0, on the radio. That was a tribute and homage. Right. Look at me. Not like the mini kiss.
49.239999999999995,55.56, So the law lets y'all introduce yourselves and then we'll get started here. I'm here with Ryan Scott
55.64,63.800000000000004, Darren Glaston. Sean Elliott and Andrew Fister on the mixing board. And I'm Jeff Green and I
63.800000000000004,68.68," love to say well, right. I'm sorry to be gone and I really sucked to being sick. I'll just have to get"
68.68,74.04, that off out of the way first because I couldn't play any games. I couldn't even read. I couldn't do
74.04,82.52000000000001, anything except playing bed. And the moral of all of this is don't go to Europe because they're
82.6,88.36," dirty people over there. If you're going to take a vacation, don't go to a place where bathing is optional."
91.24,100.28, So where are we? I kid the Europeans. I kid. I'm married to one. I can do. So now here we are back
100.28,107.96," in the Kony Island projects. Yeah. Actually, this is random. The only thing that this makes us"
107.96,114.91999999999999, not a non-sequator has to do with geography. Someone just posted on our boards. Why are this
114.91999999999999,119.32, if Davis office is located in California? Is it because there's to be close to Japan?
121.32,125.16," I mean, they're pretty good for everyone. Wow. She's not going anywhere."
125.16,129.56," Hey, everyone. Wow. Wow. That came out of that new town. It's a little scary. Yeah."
129.56,134.12," So some people of course were just like, yeah, they're close to the trans-Pacific highway."
134.84,139.16," This is, you know, to cancel next door again, isn't it? Yeah, hell."
139.88,146.28," Close to Japan. So, you know, after an event making UF, so it was worth their time. Yeah."
147.48000000000002,151.88," So we're back and I came back on a really, really good day because it's burning crusade day."
151.88,156.92000000000002, Makes me so happy because I came in and there it was waiting for me. I don't know how many of you
156.92000000000002,160.92000000000002, in this room were actually going to play it or just like sell it on eBay. But we all got it.
160.92,165.32," I'm just going to sell it. Oh, no. Totally to play it. That's 50."
165.32,167.72," Yeah, that's 50. I tried to give it. I'm not kidding if you're going to sell my"
167.72,171.39999999999998, go play because I don't even have wow installed. First thing I did is take it over to someone else
171.39999999999998,175.32," in the building that I had no place and say, hey, man, look what I got for you. And then he ended up"
175.32,179.64, getting it. So here's the problem. That means I still have a collector's edition.
179.64,182.83999999999997," Oh, be more than happy to give it to one of our listeners."
182.83999999999997,187.88," Ah, we're, we're the, I worry the, yeah, by the time we're done with this podcast, I can have to"
187.88,192.51999999999998," find some kind of victory conditions. How am I going to determine who gets it? You know,"
192.51999999999998,195.48," but we'll, maybe they want to get it right out the door right away. Maybe they're someone"
195.48,199.48," like, how do we, do you want to open our inner or something? One death match in our open"
199.48,202.76," arena? You mean in our upper room? Sure. Plenty of people we do. Yeah, I mean that's the point."
202.76,206.6," So we, yeah, but then you have to find the overlap of people who would be good. Yeah, who also"
206.6,210.51999999999998," play while we're just, by the end of the podcast, we'll come up with something and we'll just have"
210.51999999999998,216.68," to shoot us an email today. I think it's a safe to say after this, though, that this truly is the podcast"
217.32,223.48000000000002," that will change everything. Don't, don't. I'm getting it. We're going to use this phrase"
223.48000000000002,228.28," as an entire podcast. Maybe the next few podcasts, just because we know Ryan is sick of that phrase."
228.28,232.68," And we might actually get a talk. Hey, you guys."
233.48000000000002,239.96," Um, is this about where you talking about the thing that will change everything? The blank,"
239.96,243.8," the blank, the blank that will change. I know what you're talking about, but I'm playing"
243.8,248.44, double that of get for the listener who has no freaking clue what you're talking about. When
248.44,254.84," magazines use it, when TV shows use it, when any kind of serialized fiction or in some cases,"
254.84,261.16," magazines, 24 years ago already, they used it on like this. It's like the second episode of"
261.16,264.6, a new season. And it's already the episode. It will change everything. It goes into
264.6,270.04," a range for like episode 10. Well, that's the thing that I whole that out already. I just flipped"
270.04,274.28000000000003, out on my blog and posted like all about this because I saw an ad for that 20 or the other nine.
275.08000000000004,278.28000000000003," You know, and you know what? It didn't change everything. I watched the episode."
278.28000000000003,283.64000000000004," It makes it so much better to know that for anyone that's a big deal, but it didn't change everything."
283.64000000000004,288.68," For everyone that did see Ryan's blog, yeah, that he not only see Hunt and Peck"
288.68,294.12," and stare at the keyboard, but he just matches the shit out of his keyboard. Yeah. So if you want to"
294.12,299.96," actually like like anglery, you know what, but he is he's champion Hunt and Pecker. These are"
299.96,306.76, sorry. I should be the same Pecker on it. He's fast. He's fast. I've never seen anybody type that way.
306.76,311.72," Did you guys take like type like like type like type in class? I do that too, but I just like Ryan has"
311.72,316.68, got like the hammer fingers going on that thing. That's the way I've been typing since I was like
316.68,323.72, it's impressive. I do a game video video of Ryan typing an angry blog post. The way till the next
323.72,328.04," time he gets pissed. Wait, wait, actually you should see him on the comic book forums. That's yeah,"
328.04,332.36, right. The next time like you know flashed out something out of cotton. Oh my god.
332.36,336.68," God, God, God, God, God, God. I'm not going to say it again. Guy Gardner could beat up the flash."
339.72,346.12," What for Lord total two? I swear, man. So for today's agenda, we've got"
346.12,351.16," pretty much just on the usual. Like now playing, but in the course that I got a preview"
351.16,357.08, hands on pride. We got a preview to talk about. Let me tear Tory Quake Wars. Right. And I got to keep
357.08,364.6," pretty short. I'm on Dr. Zorders. Not to get this long. And some fun, a fun little, wow new story"
364.6,368.6, right along with the Burning Crusade talk. Okay. So quickly I'm Burning Crusade. And I guess there's
368.6,373.4, a burning Crusade coverage all over a one up. So we don't have to beat it to death here. But I do want to
373.4,377.56, say and I mentioned this on my blog post today. I find it incredibly amazing. This is just one of
377.56,383.32, those self serving God. PC games are great. Things. But isn't it amazing really though that
383.32,388.35999999999996, there were lines at the stores last night at midnight for a freaking expansion? I don't know.
388.35999999999996,392.76, PC game. That's it. I think it's it's not more it's making you happy to know that we
392.76,399.79999999999995, of course it is not in the days. I think you can't say one game would save our job anyway. Really.
399.88,402.92, I'm going to come up with a good one. That's when it's on my way to the world. Wow. Like a game world.
402.92,407.08, There's a good one. Yeah. I wouldn't say of our our job. Yeah. But the industry is. Yeah.
407.64,413.24, But still there really isn't I don't feel like there's a comparable moment in PC gaming like
413.24,418.36, that I can even think of where where a game release on the PC was such a big deal. And even
418.36,422.92, in Chinton so struck. And even in the console world. I don't know. I have the console world
422.92,427.64, that happens with the consoles itself. But it doesn't happen that often with the games. We know
427.64,432.36, it's going to happen with Halo three obviously. It happened with Half Life 2 and a lot of
432.36,437.15999999999997, it was on steam. Yeah. That was all on the internet. But all that we line preloaded it and we're
437.15999999999997,442.76, counting down. But long lines at regular stores at midnight expansion of a PC game. I think
442.76,446.44, it's a big deal. All right. I think part of this is just they did it. It's an online community. So
446.44,450.03999999999996, I mean part of it is just kind of like the gather and meet up with people kind of thing too. And
450.68,453.96," I mean if that's a part of it, I mean like there is blue's kind of for a reason, right? Yeah."
454.91999999999996,460.28, There is that. It's not a big deal. I think there are no. People have been leveled 60s for
460.28,464.91999999999996, however many have been waiting for two second air dungeons. Yeah. And they got a chance now to
465.71999999999997,470.28," instead of killing the red scorpion to kill the yellow scorpion. Right. Well, Golly, they're going"
470.28,475.88, to do that. That's why Sean Malose not here. He has jury duty. Yeah. Yeah. How convenient was that.
475.88,479.96, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not the day that the Bernie Crusade comes out. I'm not going to jury
479.96,488.28," duty now. I know. He's driving by his house. Oh, hi guys. You know his character name? Go on"
488.28,492.2, log. Yeah. We go to see if he's online. He's trying the case of Gilgames. I just just
492.2,495.64, prepared. He's just a bit of a mess. He's a plus five shoulder pads of doom or something.
495.64,499.47999999999996," I mean, I have to think if he thought he could tell the judge that Bernie Crusade coming out"
499.47999999999996,504.2, of that was like a hardship thing that he could get at. But that was some kind of double psych
504.2,507.96, out to me. He was saying that to me so that I wouldn't think he was actually at home.
507.96,512.1999999999999, Right. I think we set this how deep his figure has built a kitchen. We're on the
512.1999999999999,517.56," Sean. Come the fucking work tomorrow. So since we're on the wild thing, we should"
517.56,523.24, just just a quick story. And here's another one taken from the wonderful goons at
523.24,528.04," something off of forums. Oh, straight. Hey, even teasing me about this whole story. Yeah,"
528.04,531.48," this it's definitely. I mean, we're not going to do it justice. It's like almost like"
531.48,534.76, why are we reading this? You can just click yourself. So go there. Don't steal their links.
534.76,539.48," I mean, they're clicks. We go to something off of forum or just search for fork and"
539.48,544.12, world of workcraft or fork and wow. Okay. And I guess he'll find it as your first hit fork. It's
544.12,549.48, yeah. Okay. But so basically one of their their their members.
549.48,555.56," The pit you're watching because well, he was stabbed by his wife after confronting her"
555.56,560.76," for cyberring in World of Warcraft. Yeah. Oh my god. So he has pictures of his impaled,"
560.76,566.28," you know, Corp. And then body is big belly with all these four calls and bruises in real life."
566.28,569.3199999999999," Yeah, real life. What do you think? I was more than just a fork because I mean,"
569.3199999999999,573.0," and there's a knife after. There's like, I actually attack him because he caught her"
573.0,576.84, cyberring and wow. Yeah. Right. So here's here's the initial I'm just going to read his
576.84,581.4," initial story. I mean, it goes on for many, many pages and the story becomes far more"
581.4,586.92, convoluted than anyone sort of expected. I'm already so dead. So there you go. So
586.92,592.4399999999999, I caught my wife loving around with some spag on World of Warcraft again. I'll start with
592.4399999999999,597.56, the quick version since this is all anybody will see in the loan version anyway. We argued a lot
597.56,602.52, and I pushed her on the bed because she tried to hit me. She cried on the bed for a bed. I screamed
602.52,607.8, at her for a long while. She got up and tried to charge me again and I pushed her back. This
607.8,613.88, went on for a bit. Then she sees a mystery fork on the ground. Charges stabs at me with it and
614.2,618.68," runs out of the room. She then calls her mother and says, she's going to kill me and this is"
618.68,626.92," the result. Enjoy JPEG JPEG JPEG JPEG JPEG JPEG JPEG. So, of course, the the have the fun is the"
626.92,633.64, responses immediately. Very first responses like did her skill forced go up. What I wanted it to go.
633.64,641.76," It gets great. I mean, but what the hell is the fork doing by the World Warcraft computer?"
641.76,647.2," by the bad because we talked about like drowning in taco bell wrappers, but this when you have a fork next to your computer"
647.2,648.2, like that's a bad thing.
648.2,649.2, I don't know if it was the fork.
649.2,652.68, I'm guessing the fork was by the I'm trying to recreate the scene like she has stopped.
652.68,653.68, I'm guessing the fork.
653.68,655.68, He's always around the bed.
655.68,659.36, She grabs a fork and then stabs him.
659.36,661.48," Yeah, then it should later got a knife."
661.48,663.56," Unless it was a Taco Bell fork, then it could you know."
663.56,666.56," Yeah, it doesn't really feel like a rational response to being confronting with the fact"
666.56,667.56, that you were cyberring.
667.56,668.56," Yeah, it's not a fun story now."
668.56,674.0, He's going to read you could tell they've had a lot of trouble and he apparently was the first time
674.0,675.0, for it.
675.0,678.64," And it first, I mean, like it says she was loving around."
678.64,680.7199999999999," So people like, what is that mean?"
680.7199999999999,684.28," And then he got explicit and said that yes, there were various sexual eights."
684.28,685.8399999999999, They don't have animations like that.
685.8399999999999,687.1999999999999, And then trillow wasn't there.
687.1999999999999,692.28," No, they're on ventrilo and she had actual things in real life that she was using"
692.28,693.4399999999999, and stuff like we.
693.4399999999999,694.4399999999999, Yeah.
694.4399999999999,698.2399999999999, But it gets as sorted as you wanted to.
698.24,700.32, So you're going to check the story there.
700.32,701.32, Wow.
701.32,706.0, But that's for you to keep it in perspective as you go home and get out of line with your
706.0,707.88, burning crusade.
707.88,709.92, What is wrong with you that you're doing that in a game?
709.92,716.16," I mean, seriously, you can, I'm not advocating online, cyber sex or whatever, but if"
716.16,719.8," you're going to do it, why would you do it inside World of Warcraft?"
719.8,725.5600000000001," Well, yeah, you got like cartoon stuff amongst screen and put yelling like law news."
725.56,728.76, That's not stuff.
728.76,729.76, That is.
729.76,733.28," And you know, the other question is, are issue cybering while eating her taco bowl?"
733.28,735.28," Or, or she actually like, right?"
735.28,736.28, Yeah.
736.28,737.28, My guy didn't like it.
737.28,738.28, Keep there.
738.28,739.28, Not here.
739.28,741.28, This is the first part of the walkout on.
741.28,742.28," No, no, no, no."
742.28,743.28," Yeah, yeah."
743.28,744.28, I was just turned me on.
744.28,745.28," Yeah, yeah."
745.28,746.28, Yeah.
746.28,747.28, Yeah.
747.28,748.28, It was you.
748.28,750.1199999999999, The story of the hand where the guy always has a fork and has got a band of
750.16,754.04," a little bit of like kids, you should all go, you've got a whole bunch of style."
754.04,755.04," Yeah, tacos sauce."
755.04,757.48, He's got a chaloupis hanging off on a freaking holster.
757.48,759.68," Hey, you don't want to mess with her."
759.68,763.1," Taco sauce on the favorite, whatever you want, honey."
763.1,763.88," All right, we done with that."
763.88,767.96," So, you want to, let me talk about a, to interview him with quick."
767.96,769.88," Yeah, we got a real live preview here now."
769.88,770.88, We do.
770.88,774.8," Yeah, well, we're certainly we need the preview, you know, intro music."
774.8,776.92, That was not a good thing.
776.92,777.92, I can't do this.
778.0799999999999,779.92, We're going to get sued by park air and whatever.
779.92,784.4," Okay, so in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the,"
784.4,785.4, you should just came out.
785.4,787.28, Here's why getting around this now.
787.28,791.16," So, for the issue that's out to cross and cover, I went and played some quick"
791.16,792.16, wars.
792.16,794.64," And since it's out, I'm able to talk about it now."
794.64,796.24," Yeah, additional detail."
796.24,802.9599999999999," So, um, I played three maps and one of my favorite was one, I guess, those first"
802.9599999999999,805.9599999999999," first and the played outside of, you know, their, their testers will not, and it was called"
805.96,806.96, Canyon.
806.96,809.4000000000001, And we have screens of it and stuff in this year.
809.4000000000001,810.4000000000001, And it was very cool.
810.4000000000001,812.96," But, um, right, don't let me that look."
812.96,813.96," But, I sure was kidding."
813.96,816.24," I could, I was the one we were, that everyone was playing it."
816.24,818.4000000000001," Well, what was the time for you to just change it?"
818.4000000000001,820.4000000000001," This is the one, can you know, is the one that I played?"
820.4000000000001,821.4000000000001, I played.
821.4000000000001,822.4000000000001, I played.
822.4000000000001,824.24," I forget the one you played, you played Valley."
824.24,825.64," Oh, they have a awesome name."
825.64,826.64, It was like that.
826.64,827.64, Park is another one that's cool.
827.64,829.08," But so, a quick breakdown."
829.08,830.08, It's a map of truth.
830.08,833.12," It's cool thing about, I mean, there's so much to talk about the game."
833.12,838.08," So one of the cool things is that, you know, unlike, say, I did feel this way about"
838.08,839.08, Battlefield 42.
839.08,842.12," Every map, you just, so one says the name of the map."
842.12,846.52," And if you play that game, it immediately brings to mind, you know, the whole geography"
846.52,850.44," of it, everything, if someone says coral sea, it immediately is a million times different"
850.44,852.5600000000001," than like, uh, stalling grad or something."
852.5600000000001,856.08," One was basically all planes, carriers, the other is all, you know, tanks, nip and"
856.08,857.08, tree.
857.08,859.12, But it's very much like that.
859.12,865.44," And unlike like 2142 or even to an extent, Battlefield 2, where every map is very, very distinct."
865.44,869.68," I mean, as you rotate in your server order from one to the other, you definitely feel like"
869.68,871.24, it's a whole other environment.
871.24,874.12," So arc, for example, it's an Arctic environment."
874.12,877.48," But the cool thing is, not only does it look different, it has different assets than the"
877.48,878.48, other maps.
878.48,880.48," But as you play through it, it has this big switch."
880.48,883.4, You work your way into these giant biodewn facilities.
883.4,887.44," And inside, as you work your way inside, all of a sudden, it's just this big greenhouse."
887.44,891.08, And so then you pass from this really cold chili environment to a greenhouse phase and then
891.08,896.12," you work your way through that down into the more high-tech laboratory stuff, research facilities"
896.12,897.6, down in there.
897.6,900.9200000000001, And that all happens in the course of a map of Canyon.
900.9200000000001,906.0," It's a great, like it says, like a grand canyon type, combined with monument valley type"
906.0,907.1600000000001, type map.
907.1600000000001,911.7600000000001," And you end up working your way into this facility where it's like subterranean lava,"
911.7600000000001,914.48, makes to a strong technology and everything.
914.48,916.48, And maps look amazing inside or out.
916.52,918.9200000000001," I mean, it's just the engine hand doesn't matter."
918.9200000000001,923.88," It handles, I mean, everyone knows that the Doom 3 engine, which is just iterating on handles"
923.88,925.6," indoor stuff, like really well."
925.6,930.88," But I mean, with all their additional tech, the mega tech, and stuff, it makes the outdoors"
930.88,931.88, looking better.
931.88,933.28," But that's kind of a big deal, right?"
933.28,935.4, Because the outdoors of always look kind of sucky.
935.4,937.76," They were, they were, they've been always very, very shady."
937.76,938.76," I mean, like they're like four."
938.76,939.76, They're like four.
939.76,940.76, They're like four.
940.76,941.76, Yeah.
941.76,942.76, Walk outside.
942.76,945.84," It's like, that's a true thing show, you know, when you go, you get to see that skybox quarters."
945.84,946.84, All right.
946.84,947.84, Yeah.
947.84,949.4, So that was something that's really cool about it.
949.4,951.84," And then in addition, we've talked about this before."
951.84,956.88," And people that are played it at Quake on, know this, but all the maps are work the same"
956.88,960.84, way as Valley where actions funnel the specific areas.
960.84,964.12, Instead of like battlefield where they're a million cow points and so on over here.
964.12,967.6800000000001, And then they leave that and then so on goes and undo does the work they get accomplished
967.6800000000001,968.6800000000001, there.
968.6800000000001,970.12, And then they just keep going back and forth.
970.12,974.12," So say, at one moment, everyone's trying to build a bridge or everyone's trying, you're"
974.28,979.48, everyone on one team is trying to new this laser shielding array so they can gain access
979.48,982.72, to something more conversely trying to defend it.
982.72,986.96," And it just makes it, you know, everyone is, it's a lot more heated battles."
986.96,990.4," Kind of like, you know, return castle from sign every territory the same way where it"
990.4,994.96, just concentrates the action and you're not just running a million miles to do nothing or
994.96,998.16, to just regret and we die and this and that.
998.16,1000.28, All that stuff's really cool.
1000.28,1001.28, Some fun stuff.
1002.16,1005.0799999999999," I'm not sure we talked about before like this, this, this,"
1005.0799999999999,1008.48, strong and the stronger definitely entirely different humans.
1008.48,1009.28," I mean, the way that way."
1010.28,1016.16," I mean, we know that they revive, like if I have the kill human, a Gdf player, they can"
1016.16,1018.0799999999999, turn them into a strong spawn home.
1018.0799999999999,1022.16, So basically where they look like a strong and then the next person can pick that as a
1022.16,1026.8, point and then they sort of like resurrect in that character can come up.
1026.8,1029.6, And enemies in a human's character.
1029.6,1031.1599999999999," Yeah, it changes the model though."
1031.1599999999999,1034.28," So so here we hear me an example, Sam, they've struggled technicians as a"
1034.28,1035.28, equivalent of a medic.
1035.28,1039.32, I kill human and then I start to struggle.
1039.32,1042.08," I, I, I change him in, you know, as part of the, he has a, you know,"
1042.08,1043.32," metallic parts, strap to himself."
1043.32,1044.8799999999999, It's still laying there on the ground.
1044.8799999999999,1049.3999999999999, Then one of his teammates killed me and I had already struggled by the body of his
1049.3999999999999,1052.4399999999998, teammate who was sitting there and he didn't go around and get rid of it and just like
1052.4399999999998,1053.4399999999998, so it's still laying there.
1053.4399999999998,1056.24, So I immediately spawned right back after he killed me.
1056.24,1057.7199999999998, I spawned back in the body of his friend.
1057.8,1061.0," Yeah, just killed him that killed him from behind, which is really cool."
1061.0,1065.56," And then they have these, they still drones, these flyer drones that they can throw out."
1065.56,1069.6000000000001, And you've seen these in other games where you control in person and they've a camera
1069.6000000000001,1071.6000000000001," attached, they could self-destruct."
1071.6000000000001,1077.0," But the fun thing is that in the course of like one objective, it works out so that a whole"
1077.0,1081.28," bunch of you are trying to fly these things through this, you know, pipe net work and"
1081.28,1084.72, into blow up some structure that the GTF guys are protecting.
1084.72,1087.0," And then so from your play, it's kind of different."
1087.0,1089.2," You're all, you know, using these buzz bobs."
1089.2,1092.28," And then the GTF guys, it's like playing duck con or something like there's another one."
1092.28,1093.8," There's another one, Chew and does."
1093.8,1095.16, And that's that's pretty cool.
1095.16,1099.8," Have we tried playing, I don't know if it was so stifling implement it when I was checking"
1099.8,1101.4," it out a while back, the infiltrator though."
1101.4,1103.64," And then like basically I want the one you can like, the same check."
1103.64,1104.64, You can just spy.
1104.64,1109.16, The one you can inject yourself into a GDI soldier and then kind of like mask yourself
1109.16,1110.16, as him.
1110.16,1112.64, I didn't do too much with that.
1112.64,1116.0, But it seemed pretty close in application to what we're used to.
1116.0,1120.24," Spides where you basically assume, you know, the physical appearance of another character"
1120.24,1122.24, and the opposing team.
1122.24,1123.24, Right.
1123.24,1126.92," And then you'll lose that disguise if you use heavy weapons, betrayal of the user,"
1126.92,1130.08, your melee weapons and stuff and retain your disguise.
1130.08,1131.08, That was cool.
1131.08,1132.64, What else I want to say about it?
1132.64,1137.68," There's I was really impressed with the balance of, you know, all the deployable structures."
1137.68,1139.04, I know those would be huge.
1139.04,1142.04, And that's what I thought that looked deep and good way back at E3.
1142.04,1143.04, Right.
1143.04,1144.04, And the sheer number of them.
1144.04,1145.04," So I thought, yeah."
1145.08,1149.04," I mean, so like in battle, you know, you've got the commander controls the artillery,"
1149.04,1154.32," commander controls the, you know, the UAV satellite track and all these things."
1154.32,1158.8799999999999, Here's how decentralized because they don't want anyone player to have that much power to
1158.8799999999999,1163.3999999999999," like ruin or basically, you know, guarantee the victory of a team."
1163.3999999999999,1167.52, So it's distributed to each individual players and then it's almost like it's automated
1167.52,1170.36, the way that it all connects works together.
1170.36,1174.8799999999999," But it's even more specific though instead of just artillery, you'd have three types"
1174.88,1176.8400000000001, of basically artillery things.
1176.8400000000001,1181.96," Now, one would be effective at if you're wiping out infantry."
1181.96,1186.6000000000001, One is great for vehicles and another is great for countering other deployables.
1186.6000000000001,1190.3600000000001," And then so not only that, so like I said, you go into and you're trying to take a bridge."
1190.3600000000001,1192.7600000000002, You're trying to secure a bridge head and build a bridge.
1192.7600000000002,1197.2800000000002," But the enemy is throwing up all sorts of like anti tank turrets, anti infantry turrets and"
1197.2800000000002,1198.2800000000002, stuff.
1198.2800000000002,1202.72," So then you have your guys and you go up on a hill, spot that and you can launch anti deployable"
1202.72,1203.72, missiles at it.
1203.8,1207.92," So you're dropping these big, you know, Megaton missiles into them on that and then they're"
1207.92,1210.68," like, okay, well, they're they're they get sick of you doing that."
1210.68,1214.96, So they put up a shield generator and that basically intercepts like active missile defense
1214.96,1217.2, thing and that will intercept what you're throwing in.
1217.2,1221.56," So then one of your technicians has to go and not take nations on your, forget the class,"
1221.56,1226.6000000000001," but one of your, the equivalent of a spec ops has to go in to can sabotage the shield generator"
1226.6000000000001,1230.44," and everything has got like a counter, like very specifically, a very cleanly has counter"
1230.44,1231.44, to it.
1231.44,1234.96," It's not like, you know, to and it just is cool like back and forth in the way that you"
1234.96,1240.04," would with RTS, you know, like just like helping heroes and they got an MG up and you're"
1240.04,1243.2," like, okay, shit, I need to get a sniper, but they're like, hey, that guy's going to bring"
1243.2,1244.2, a sniper.
1244.2,1247.52," So put a motorcycle out front, the motorcycle catch is sniper and so on and so forth."
1247.52,1250.3600000000001," It very much works, works in that fashion."
1250.3600000000001,1254.6000000000001," And I, I really appreciate the challenges to totally like, you know, asymmetrical forces and"
1254.6000000000001,1258.76, the fact that I able to balance these two to totally different disparate types of forces.
1258.92,1260.92," Well, you're right, it is like a strategy game."
1260.92,1262.84, Like any good strategy game can do that.
1262.84,1266.64," You know, that's the, Sean, listening to you talk about this."
1266.64,1271.52," Do you feel like, like, when I, when I hear all this and just the little I played back at"
1271.52,1278.0," E3, like, do you feel like random, newbie casual shooter types are going to be able to"
1278.0,1282.32," jump and play this kind of game or, or is it going to be prohibitive in the same way that"
1282.32,1285.36, battlefield kind of became prohibitive and certainly counter strike was.
1285.36,1286.36, Yeah.
1286.36,1287.84, I already know all the shit.
1287.84,1289.84, It just became impossible to just come on and go.
1289.84,1291.3999999999999," I want to shoot stuff, right."
1291.3999999999999,1293.36," You know, I know, just that I was actually playing."
1293.36,1297.8799999999999," I've been playing Battlefield 42 over the weekend, just because I wanted to fly some"
1297.8799999999999,1298.8799999999999, more of our two planes.
1298.8799999999999,1303.52," And it's just amazing me like, how is like, oh, God, like, I remember I tried to get"
1303.52,1306.8799999999999, like some people from Egypt into that when it came out 1942.
1306.8799999999999,1308.28," Yeah, they were just clueless."
1308.28,1311.6399999999999," They were like, and that's scary because that game was still pretty."
1311.6399999999999,1313.24," I mean, that was kind of low rent."
1313.24,1314.24, Like I played that a lot.
1314.32,1317.44, And I just played as an infantry dude and I could almost play that as a shooter.
1317.44,1318.44, Yeah.
1318.44,1321.76," I mean, I was just gone from capture point to capture point shooting guys."
1321.76,1323.24, And I did fine in that game.
1323.24,1324.24, Yeah.
1324.24,1329.68," I think they're definitely, they definitely want to make it more accessible and automated"
1329.68,1330.68, stuff helps.
1330.68,1337.6," So for example, if you picked, you know, like a soldier or something and or whatever class"
1337.6,1342.4," you pick, it's going to tell you, it's going to create a mission for you and say,"
1342.4,1347.48," and you know, hey, go and destroy this turret that the enemy put up."
1347.48,1348.48, Someone on your team.
1348.48,1352.64, So another new one your team is whatever class and he puts up a radar.
1352.64,1354.0400000000002, He doesn't need to know what to do.
1354.0400000000002,1356.48," The computer says, hey, go put a radar up."
1356.48,1357.48, So he does.
1357.48,1359.3200000000002, And that radar punch is through to the other new.
1359.3200000000002,1362.3600000000001," And says, hey, we just detected that there's a tank here in this."
1362.3600000000001,1364.3600000000001, You should go kill them in this order.
1364.3600000000001,1366.3200000000002, We're going to prioritize them for you.
1366.3200000000002,1370.1200000000001, And we'll highlight it on your map for you as because the radar is detecting it.
1370.1200000000001,1371.1200000000001, So it still makes sense.
1371.12,1373.7199999999998," And then, of course, the game, you go do that and you're going to get extra points."
1373.7199999999998,1377.6799999999998, So you're going to get more points for doing that than if you just go around and blow up
1377.6799999999998,1379.28, any old tank or something.
1379.28,1385.1999999999998," So it's still, and also too, like they, they even have it."
1385.1999999999998,1388.6399999999999," So I mean, if you're, if you're quick with the game and you want to go up and destroy this"
1388.6399999999999,1392.0," thing, what you would have to do is you pull out basically an explosive charge."
1392.0,1393.0, You stick it to it.
1393.0,1396.56, Then you pull out another tool and you have to activate the thing and then you run away.
1396.56,1397.56, But they have a button.
1397.56,1398.8799999999999, It just works a little slower.
1398.88,1402.92," If you're new, you just press one key and it will automatically do all those things for"
1402.92,1403.92, you.
1403.92,1406.8600000000001," But it's just not as fast as the pro who knows to like, weapon switch between those"
1406.8600000000001,1407.8600000000001, and hurry up and do it.
1407.8600000000001,1411.24," But you're still, and with, so you don't have to go up to it and say, well, what the"
1411.24,1414.3200000000002," house, an activator, what the house, the charge, you just press this button and it will"
1414.3200000000002,1416.7600000000002, do what you need to do on that area.
1416.7600000000002,1417.7600000000002, Just stick that.
1417.7600000000002,1422.1200000000001," I just worry about games like this sometimes, you know that, like, especially as they're"
1422.1200000000001,1425.5600000000002," getting more, like, as they get more sophisticated and better, like they're great for"
1425.6399999999999,1429.0," guys like you, right, or total veterans at doing this."
1429.0,1433.52," But like, I just wonder if they start getting prohibitive to people who just want to play"
1433.52,1435.9199999999998, this new game and have a good time.
1435.9199999999998,1438.28," They, they, they almost always are."
1438.28,1440.84," I mean, that's the whole, that's a big part of this game."
1440.84,1446.6799999999998," But interestingly, I say, like the most prohibitive in that sense are really simple."
1446.6799999999998,1448.24," Like, quick, three or something."
1448.24,1453.52," I think, or even like, four are super prohibitive because the people are so good at them."
1453.52,1455.08," That if you, yeah, you have no chance."
1455.08,1460.76," So what battlefield did was it gave you the ability to get a tank and blast, like, five"
1460.76,1465.04," dudes on foot and there's, say, there's only one AT guy with or something or one engineer"
1465.04,1466.04, lay in mind.
1466.04,1468.84," So even if you weren't that, even if you weren't the guy that can just run game and"
1468.84,1473.08," knows the timing on, like, the quad damage, yeah, bond and stuff, you can go in and"
1473.08,1477.28, get the tank or get the plane and drop a bomb on some dudes and get a kill.
1477.28,1482.72," But here, though, one thing is, it's almost got quite, I mean, they insisted that it was"
1482.72,1485.8, actually slower than quite three by significant margin.
1485.8,1490.4," But when you're used to playing like a battlefield or something, quick wars is faster than"
1490.4,1491.4, hell.
1491.4,1494.8, Guys running and there's a sprint button and there's no stamina whatsoever.
1494.8,1497.8, You just do what you just can't shoot when you're sprinting.
1497.8,1500.32," And they currently, these are all variables that they're worth."
1500.32,1501.32, And I made a big point.
1501.32,1502.32," I mean, I had three key things."
1502.32,1504.28," I was like, these are concerns to me."
1504.28,1505.52," You know, what do you guys think about them?"
1505.52,1506.52, Yep.
1506.52,1507.64," And they're like, you know, definitely you're here."
1507.64,1512.68," But, um, so you wouldn't even lose, like, you could, you could strafe sprint."
1512.68,1515.0800000000002, And you wouldn't even lose stamina or studied.
1515.0800000000002,1519.24," And so what happens is the game when you start projecting distances, you know, say,"
1519.24,1522.92," you can, you can be as fast as you want in the corridor in a rat's maze and quick format,"
1522.92,1524.8," you know, or space bounces and even that big."
1524.8,1528.48," But then we take this giant thing and say, you're looking at someone down, down your"
1528.48,1529.48, iron sights.
1529.48,1533.48," And once they get to a hundred yards away, that's be translates into like the movement of a"
1533.48,1536.72, net or a quick moving net or something in front of me.
1536.72,1538.5600000000002," You trying to, it's like trying to hit him with chopsticks."
1538.5600000000002,1539.72," Like, uh, credit."
1539.72,1540.72, It's on Ryan.
1540.72,1543.72, So that was curious to me.
1543.72,1545.96," I did get used to it, but it was on Ryan."
1545.96,1550.1200000000001, And they do counter it because the difference isn't like obviously the battlefield accuracy
1550.1200000000001,1554.92," is just completely, you know, depending on your gun, if you're not prone and firing in"
1554.92,1555.92," burst, right?"
1555.92,1559.32," You're going to be shooting across like this, you know, great, true size thing in your"
1559.32,1560.32, screen.
1560.32,1561.32, Whereas here it's pinpoint.
1561.32,1564.52," It's like, if you have a hyperblaster that dot in the center of the screen is where"
1564.52,1566.0, your shots will hit.
1566.0,1568.76," So because of that, it makes it easier to."
1568.76,1572.48," But I do think that if they tone the speed down a little bit, it would be."
1572.48,1573.48, I don't know.
1573.48,1577.4, But we have a beat as also a part of like what Quake's always been.
1577.4,1578.4, That's it.
1578.4,1579.4, That's what's tough.
1579.4,1580.4, That defines that game.
1580.4,1584.76," But I swear, once you, if you make a game that fast, you're making a game for those"
1584.76,1586.68," like 10 savants, right?"
1586.68,1589.4," But I want to want to be too realistic either, too, though."
1589.4,1590.4, Yeah.
1590.4,1591.4, Right.
1591.4,1592.84," I mean, it is the sci-fi Quake universe, too."
1592.84,1593.84, Watch us in need to be.
1593.84,1598.36," I, the last time I watched you play 2042, it was agonizing for me to see you try to turn"
1598.36,1601.1999999999998," around and shoot something and then he, yeah, slow."
1601.1999999999998,1603.9199999999998," That game is like, I haven't played a shooter at my legs."
1603.9199999999998,1604.9199999999998, It was so humiliating.
1604.9199999999998,1608.9199999999998," The standing, they're playing in Sean's standing behind me going like, oh man."
1608.9199999999998,1614.56," Like, yeah, I feel, well, it would be like if I got a workout and I go and start"
1614.56,1616.8," beat on the fire monster with the like five, five, five."
1616.8,1619.4399999999998," But like, I mean, no, but like, I will, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I, you know,"
1619.4399999999998,1620.4399999999998, I'm in that.
1620.4399999999998,1621.4399999999998, Do you have any energy?
1621.4399999999998,1622.4399999999998, You're healing a minute.
1622.4399999999998,1625.52," But like, I didn't even know the controls at that point."
1625.52,1627.0, I didn't even know what I was doing in there.
1627.0,1628.0, Yeah.
1628.0,1629.0, You're like me.
1629.0,1631.52," Don't be like, he's like, they're like arrow keys."
1631.52,1632.52, Yeah.
1632.52,1633.52, Yeah.
1633.52,1634.52, Funny.
1634.52,1635.52, Yeah.
1635.52,1642.8," So that's the speed of one thing that I don't know, but it's, it also makes it different."
1642.8,1646.36," It makes it, you know, not battlefield or something like that."
1646.36,1647.36, Yeah.
1647.36,1649.36," It was a, we're running out of time already."
1649.36,1650.36, I'm ready.
1650.36,1651.36," No, go on."
1651.36,1652.36, We can move on.
1652.36,1653.36," But, um, no."
1653.36,1655.36, Don't worry about it.
1655.36,1656.36, Okay.
1656.36,1659.12," Well, things about that game, I'm still waiting to see how it all works out, but they're"
1659.12,1663.1599999999999," going to have a whole bunch of unlocks, similar to battlefield."
1663.1599999999999,1669.6," Again, and that's, it's set, instead of having a persistent over time, because they don't"
1669.6,1671.3999999999999," want the good players getting better, right?"
1671.3999999999999,1677.12," Or having, uh, an automatic, you know, ability to just destroy news is you're insane."
1677.12,1679.84, You get them in the course of play on a single server.
1679.84,1682.8799999999999," So say if you do like four maps on the server, you're able to get them that way."
1682.8799999999999,1683.8799999999999, Right.
1683.8799999999999,1684.8799999999999, Lighting guns.
1685.64,1688.68," Um, and just tons and tons of specific attribute buffs."
1688.68,1692.16," But then that's far for them to go away when you like, you showed me a master list"
1692.16,1695.96, and they're far more like attribute buffs and stuff like that than there would be in
1695.96,1696.96, 2042.
1697.2,1701.1200000000001," And, but yeah, they're gone once you want to log off and you have to choose again the next"
1701.1200000000001,1701.8000000000002, time and play.
1702.2,1704.3200000000002," How you think it sounds like an RPD, right?"
1704.96,1705.4, Right.
1705.92,1707.3600000000001, It tracks a lot of stuff.
1707.3600000000001,1708.24, It game actually.
1708.24,1709.16, It works.
1709.16,1709.92, It's not getting any way.
1710.8000000000002,1711.5600000000002, The way you play.
1711.6399999999999,1717.08," So if you're playing, you know, aggressively and you were, you know, you're dealing a whole"
1717.08,1718.08, lot of damage.
1718.32,1722.08, It's going to count like it puts a certain spin on that in the way that it gives you HP
1722.08,1723.28," out of you, uh, XP."
1724.0,1727.36," And then if you're not only dealing a lot of damage, but you're also taking a lot of damage"
1727.36,1730.24, and you're still staying alive in between spawns and stuff.
1730.44,1734.9199999999998," I mean, it's going to give you even more like a multiplier on multiplayer on your XP."
1735.48,1736.84, So there's some cool stuff like that.
1736.84,1741.08," I mean, it's it's definitely people will be like trying to work out exactly how to"
1741.12,1746.0, maximize like their their XP flow and the side from killing things and doing
1746.0,1749.6," doing stuff on their on their mission, but yeah, that's pretty cool stuff."
1750.56,1752.6799999999998, And the bottom line is when I play the game.
1753.1999999999998,1756.4399999999998," I mean, that's always as I mean, you can go and explain and talk around a game and"
1756.4399999999998,1760.04," say here's what it does and how it works, but the bottom line is when I came away from"
1760.04,1763.36," I was like, God, why is it so long until this game comes out?"
1763.8,1764.6799999999998, And what are they?
1764.6799999999998,1765.8799999999999, Because I really wanted to play.
1765.8799999999999,1768.32," I was like, I can't just take this home and play this all night."
1768.32,1774.6399999999999," You know, and it's it's pushed back to usual for it."
1774.6399999999999,1779.04," It's a splash damage to the game, but for for the whole ensembles instead of done"
1779.04,1782.08," one is done, it's like you'll be playing it before Quake on."
1782.8799999999999,1786.6799999999998," So Sean, that was like a good like they can use that for the box quake."
1787.2,1788.72, What can I be playing this already?
1788.72,1789.48," Yeah, we shall."
1789.48,1790.3999999999999," Sally, you're in the fine."
1790.3999999999999,1793.56," I'm playing games tonight, guys."
1794.52,1795.3999999999999, I'm bootlegny.
1795.3999999999999,1796.3999999999999, Pointed.
1796.3999999999999,1797.12, I played it on.
1797.6,1798.8, It's quite common.
1798.8,1799.8, It's like July or August.
1800.3999999999999,1801.8799999999999, We need to I'm 2007.
1801.8799999999999,1803.96, We got to work on getting on more box codes.
1803.96,1805.8799999999999, We need more sort of horish on this box.
1805.8799999999999,1806.3999999999999, Horish.
1806.3999999999999,1807.52," Okay, so what are some of the rat?"
1807.52,1809.6399999999999, We need to this in the game that'll change everyone.
1809.6399999999999,1810.24, So here we go.
1810.24,1810.9199999999998, There we go.
1810.9199999999998,1811.24, Okay.
1811.24,1814.36," Well, we just had that one in Ryan."
1814.36,1817.1599999999999," Remember, I was like, point out it was like from some German game."
1817.72,1821.36, It was like this is a game that's gotten hack and slashing.
1821.52,1824.1999999999998, This is an RPG with the hack and slash variety.
1824.56,1826.12, Like that was like a review quote.
1826.6399999999999,1827.1599999999999, It was.
1827.1599999999999,1830.1999999999998," Yeah, this is an RPG of the hack and slash variety."
1830.1999999999998,1831.0," Wow, oops, sorry."
1831.0,1832.28, We're kind of hurting for a quote.
1832.28,1832.6399999999999, Yeah.
1832.6399999999999,1833.0, Yeah.
1833.0,1835.9199999999998, And it's like a movie review from wireless review or something.
1835.9199999999998,1836.36, Yeah.
1837.36,1838.36, So there's some.
1838.6,1840.84," Yeah, I think it's good to not be on."
1841.04,1843.1599999999999, We have no idea because I was thinking like more
1843.1599999999999,1844.1599999999999, or jealous.
1844.1599999999999,1845.6," 2007, you know, yeah."
1845.6,1846.7199999999998, That's going to be my motto.
1846.7199999999998,1848.52," So every podcast, he just picks a random game and he."
1848.52,1849.56," Yeah, and it's like cool."
1849.56,1850.3999999999999, Great things about it.
1850.4,1851.72, So we get on the box right.
1851.72,1852.96, We don't even have to play it.
1854.16,1857.8000000000002," You like, you know, the shooter of the shooter righty."
1859.92,1860.96, It's shooter Rific.
1862.2800000000002,1863.48, It's blast hashtag.
1864.64,1865.3200000000002, Let me see.
1865.5600000000002,1866.4, Now what can it.
1868.64,1870.0400000000002, I hear some quotes actually.
1870.0400000000002,1870.48," Yeah, look."
1870.48,1874.3600000000001," Yeah, Sean, but was a trade-out with some quotes before we broadcast it."
1874.4,1878.16," No, that these are like, actually, these are just for a loss"
1878.16,1880.5600000000002," of a plan for 360, but okay, gorgeous graphics."
1880.5600000000002,1881.96, I won't read who they're source to.
1881.96,1883.3200000000002," Okay, action pack."
1883.68,1883.96, All right.
1883.96,1886.0, I need to say some of the publications either side.
1886.0,1886.3600000000001," No, no."
1888.3600000000001,1889.76," I don't, we never on."
1889.96,1890.76," I know, we don't."
1890.76,1891.68, I'm just saying town.
1891.68,1891.88, Yeah.
1893.0400000000002,1894.6000000000001, Capcom has another winner on it.
1894.6000000000001,1895.16, Tans.
1895.96,1896.88, That's from Capcom.
1896.88,1898.88, Lee says a few shares to Ksh.
1898.88,1899.68, Mama Capcom.
1901.3200000000002,1902.8000000000002, It were eight simply rocks.
1903.64,1905.0800000000002, They need one that just says F.T.
1905.0800000000002,1905.52, W.
1906.64,1907.1200000000001, Yeah.
1907.1200000000001,1907.72, And then we.
1908.68,1912.52, I like the ones that say best game ever period period period
1912.52,1913.32, in between this one.
1913.32,1913.52, Yeah.
1914.76,1915.3600000000001, Because that's interesting.
1915.3600000000001,1916.72, So are you going to read us on a caption?
1916.72,1917.28, How old is that?
1917.28,1917.8, 10 years old?
1917.8,1918.08, No.
1918.08,1918.44, Yeah.
1918.44,1918.96, What?
1919.1200000000001,1919.88, The sims are saying.
1919.88,1920.24, Yeah.
1920.44,1921.72," Yeah, but it's comic book."
1922.32,1922.84, About him.
1922.84,1923.68," Yeah, you got a pause."
1923.68,1924.28, Mast.
1925.44,1926.2, Got my mark.
1926.2,1926.76, comic.
1928.04,1928.96, Never.
1929.1200000000001,1930.3600000000001, If we're going to do some flam.
1930.3600000000001,1931.4, I could do that for real.
1931.4,1932.92," You know, I fake it up there."
1933.92,1934.3600000000001, I don't know.
1934.3600000000001,1935.3600000000001, I'm not going to read you anything.
1935.3600000000001,1936.24, What did you want me to read you?
1936.24,1937.08, Katna.
1937.08,1938.76, That's the way that that's OK.
1938.76,1940.4399999999998, The box stuff is red.
1940.76,1941.24, Guess what?
1941.24,1942.72, Other game magazines stink.
1942.72,1944.4399999999998, That was our point.
1944.4399999999998,1945.72, That says Jeff Green.
1945.72,1946.72, Yeah.
1946.72,1948.36, I was just weird.
1948.36,1949.9199999999998, We'll put that quote in the front.
1949.9199999999998,1950.72, Next issue.
1951.72,1953.1599999999999, Our competition's lame.
1955.4399999999998,1955.8, Yeah.
1955.8,1957.24, Do we have anything else to talk about today?
1958.08,1958.6399999999999, Besides the line.
1958.6399999999999,1959.84, Your home soon and got a bed.
1959.84,1960.4399999999998, You do.
1960.4399999999998,1961.52, Back to bed for you.
1961.52,1962.08, Let the roar.
1962.08,1965.48, I know what the mind just sounds like from the special sick bed edition.
1965.48,1966.48, Yeah.
1966.56,1967.84, Spin is almost nasty.
1967.84,1968.84, What's an A fun?
1968.84,1969.84, I can't even play games.
1969.84,1970.84, I played one.
1971.16,1971.64, The S.
1971.64,1972.16, That's good.
1972.3600000000001,1973.44," Oh, it's my cell phone."
1973.44,1977.4," Well, it's vibrating on the on their cast table."
1977.4,1979.72, Sounds like the wild players wife's back at it.
1980.72,1981.96, We have other topics.
1981.96,1982.48, Darren.
1982.48,1984.3600000000001," Well, I mean, I was trying to keep it like this month."
1984.3600000000001,1984.72, Yeah.
1984.72,1986.08," As we can say, you had to get raise home."
1986.08,1988.64," But, you know, I actually just caught this one last thing."
1988.64,1989.8," You know, you know, to comment on this now,"
1989.8,1991.4, but it was an interesting comment on the boards.
1991.4,1992.16, I just caught.
1992.16,1992.3600000000001, OK.
1992.3600000000001,1994.56, It was games you wish would be made.
1995.52,1996.12, What would you like?
1996.12,1996.9199999999998, What would you like?
1996.9199999999998,1999.48, I started off with it with like two like for example.
1999.48,2001.76," Well, his example was pretty retarded was a."
2001.76,2004.2, Can't the brain tales the game.
2004.2,2005.2, Wow.
2005.2,2005.8, Is he serious?
2005.8,2007.84," This is not gothic or like, well,"
2007.84,2009.6399999999999, what was he used to talk about like a Diablo cut.
2009.6399999999999,2011.6, I totally just jumped this down the last second.
2011.6,2012.72," But it was like, this guy was talking about like a can't"
2012.72,2014.6399999999999, to bring tales like Diablo game.
2014.6399999999999,2015.36, Wow.
2015.36,2017.32, How English made me a suggestion.
2017.32,2018.1599999999999, No.
2018.1599999999999,2019.12, That better not have been.
2019.12,2020.12," No, who I guess I read."
2020.12,2020.96, I was a freshman.
2020.96,2022.12, He's going to play the name.
2022.12,2022.9199999999998," I'm like, I say the name."
2022.9199999999998,2023.9199999999998, I wasn't our friend.
2023.92,2027.48, I don't think that creepy face staring back at me.
2027.48,2028.3600000000001, That's something you do.
2028.3600000000001,2029.8400000000001, Listen to this.
2029.8400000000001,2030.64," Yeah, be nice."
2030.64,2032.2, I don't know what you don't know what I'm talking about.
2032.2,2033.64, I'm just talking about the first.
2033.64,2035.04, I'm just talking about the first.
2035.04,2037.64, Whether or any other good suggestions.
2037.64,2041.52, I literally I just read just wrote that first line down before I ran off.
2041.52,2042.72, That's a pretty broad topic.
2042.72,2043.72, Exactly.
2043.72,2045.04," Those are horrible threads though in my opinion,"
2045.04,2048.64," because they always turn into like some kid just like,"
2048.64,2052.6800000000003," you know, some man maybe remember and like the greatest hits of this"
2052.68,2054.24," childhood, want to bring them back."
2054.24,2056.7599999999998," Yeah, we're just cleaning why their movies like Transformers the movie."
2056.7599999999998,2057.7599999999998, Coming out.
2057.7599999999998,2060.52," You know, the same guy goes like, well, I could do with the Thundercats game,"
2060.52,2066.7599999999998," followed by Tiger Sharks, maybe Jason the Wheelboy years in mask,"
2066.7599999999998,2067.68, mask crusaders.
2067.68,2068.68, We're in overtime.
2068.68,2069.2, That's right.
2069.2,2070.64, It hasn't been a guy for a movie.
2070.64,2071.64, They really need to be a cat.
2071.64,2073.08, They're power soldiers to oil.
2073.08,2073.64," Oh, my gosh."
2073.64,2074.0, Right.
2074.0,2075.0, They're a mess.
2075.0,2075.44, Yeah.
2075.44,2077.04," Anything you can remember, webster."
2077.04,2077.64, Things can happen.
2077.64,2078.2799999999997, Video game.
2078.2799999999997,2079.44," Oh, man."
2079.44,2080.04, I was so excited.
2080.04,2080.44, Yeah.
2080.44,2081.44, The whole thing.
2081.44,2081.88," Yeah, you float."
2081.88,2082.88, He floats on balloons.
2082.88,2083.88, You got likes.
2083.88,2084.88, Drugs.
2084.88,2085.88," Hey, guys."
2085.88,2086.88," Hey, guys."
2086.88,2087.2000000000003, You got you up in 7-11 today.
2087.2000000000003,2088.2000000000003, Ghostbusters.
2088.2000000000003,2089.48, Whatever stuff's going on.
2089.48,2090.48, What was that?
2090.48,2091.48, Let's go to the other.
2091.48,2094.48," Oh, the video that was float around today on, um, I don't know."
2094.48,2095.48, I can't believe you.
2095.48,2098.48, Developed by some guys who don't actually have the license to do.
2098.48,2100.12, Why do you think you got the game?
2100.12,2102.32, Pacific model of like new Chrysler.
2102.32,2105.64," I suspect, I mean, I can be proven wrong."
2105.64,2110.4," But my hunch is that, and if it's not the case this time, it's going to happen soon."
2110.4,2112.12," But like that, it's like a game."
2112.12,2113.12, It's funded.
2113.12,2114.12, It's in development.
2114.12,2115.12, And this is the way to reveal it.
2115.12,2118.2400000000002," So instead of the usual route say, like, hey, let's talk to one up or something."
2118.2400000000002,2119.2400000000002, And let's reveal this game there.
2119.2400000000002,2121.28, Talk to GFW and reveal our cover.
2121.28,2124.2000000000003, It's like a game where you're probably not going to get a cover.
2124.2000000000003,2126.56," So it's like, just put it out there randomly on YouTube."
2126.56,2128.0, But don't say what the hell it is.
2128.0,2130.84," Let people talk and spread it around and say, dude, you see this?"
2130.84,2131.84, Let it be a mystery.
2131.84,2135.6," I'm sorry, but then you're like, hey, by the way, then you can give the story to someone"
2135.6,2136.6, guess what?
2136.6,2139.08, All that stuff that we've already been like training you to get hyped about for like
2139.08,2141.04, the past two months is really a game.
2141.04,2143.12, And now you can read it on this cover too.
2143.12,2144.12, So I don't know.
2144.12,2145.84," I mean, it's not take my idea now."
2145.84,2149.52," I'm not like, I'll say how annoying it is later."
2149.52,2150.96, But that just seems like a great idea.
2150.96,2152.7999999999997, Say you got some random ask game.
2152.7999999999997,2159.04," That's not like a fallout, whatever, MMO or something like that."
2159.04,2161.0, They're equivalent to some Diablo 3 or...
2161.0,2167.16," No, I mean, that's totally possible considering the, what happened with the Sony blogger."
2167.24,2169.24, I want to PSP for granted.
2169.24,2171.2799999999997, It was totally like lit up up.
2171.2799999999997,2173.48, The thing is it looked like...
2173.48,2177.16," I wasn't sure, but it looks like it was a new E3."
2177.16,2179.08, And it's just like no one's modding on that.
2179.08,2180.72," That's not, you know."
2180.72,2181.72, So who's...
2181.72,2183.72," Well, I mean, I think there are reports."
2183.72,2184.72, I have some...
2184.72,2186.72," I was like, you're up at Universalis."
2186.72,2188.72," Yeah, they used that in."
2188.72,2190.72, It looked that good.
2190.72,2193.72, I'm looking forward to playing the back game.
2193.72,2196.72," We're going to call, wait three turns."
2197.72,2200.7999999999997," Well, you're going to call Sulemon of the Ottoman Turks."
2200.7999999999997,2202.7999999999997, That's where you're going to call.
2209.04,2209.8399999999997," Yeah, I don't know."
2209.8399999999997,2213.52, You don't get a lot of Ottoman Empire jokes on other gaming podcasts.
2213.52,2216.0, That's why we're special here at FW.
2216.0,2216.7999999999997," Oh, shoot!"
2219.2799999999997,2221.2799999999997, They thought that shit ended with Johnny Wilson.
2221.2799999999997,2222.2799999999997, But it didn't.
2222.2799999999997,2222.7599999999998, It's back.
2222.7599999999998,2224.04, So a kick-a-guard next week?
2224.04,2224.6, Yeah.
2224.6,2225.48, Awesome.
2225.56,2227.08," Ash, I should probably go."
2227.08,2227.6, Because...
2227.6,2228.6," Yeah, you get a game."
2228.6,2229.6, I just got the head.
2229.6,2232.28," No, I tried to end it on some horn playing."
2232.28,2233.12, But...
2233.12,2234.2400000000002," Oh, that was the end music."
2234.2400000000002,2235.12, That was supposed to be...
2235.12,2236.12, That was the end music.
2236.12,2237.4, We don't have...
2237.4,2238.4," We need the theme, too."
2238.4,2239.4," We don't have the theme, too."
2239.4,2240.4, Or anything like that.
2240.4,2242.0, We're so low-rent here.
2242.0,2242.84, It's just kept on...
2242.84,2244.84, You do mean music for one of those.
2244.84,2245.84, For one of yours.
2245.84,2246.84, Soundbores and bites.
2246.84,2248.48, Maybe we should just have a little bit of this
2248.48,2250.48, to start up at end theme in music.
2250.48,2251.88," Oh, that's right."
2251.88,2252.88, You know.
2252.88,2255.44, That's starting your computer and daily it off.
2255.92,2256.48," Oh, yeah."
2256.48,2257.48, There we go.
2257.48,2258.48, Wow.
2258.48,2259.48," Wow, that sucks."
2259.48,2260.48, That'd be really...
2260.48,2261.48, Yeah.
2261.48,2262.48, That was so...
2262.48,2263.48, So we should do it.
2263.48,2264.48, We should do it.
2264.48,2265.48, But we...
2265.48,2266.48, It would have been a rat surprise.
2266.48,2267.48, I would...
2267.48,2268.48," Yeah, we'd blow it now."
2268.48,2271.0," And have like a false alarm where it just goes off at one point,"
2271.0,2272.48, like a power surge and combat action.
2272.48,2273.48," Oh, yeah."
2273.48,2274.48, Yeah.
2274.48,2275.48, That's what we could do for our break.
2275.48,2276.48, Yeah.
2276.48,2277.48," Oh, we have to reboot."
2277.48,2278.48, Yeah.
2278.48,2279.96," Okay, you're salute."
2279.96,2280.96, We're done.
2280.96,2281.96," Ryan, I'm sorry."
2281.96,2283.76, We didn't get much a chance to talk to you this.
2283.76,2285.4," Oh, we're still here, Ryan."
2285.4,2286.4, Hi.
2286.4,2289.6800000000003," You know, I got crap on gaming age one time for..."
2289.6800000000003,2291.36, from making Ryan talk.
2291.36,2292.84," Yeah, what's your problem?"
2292.84,2293.84, I don't know.
2293.84,2299.88," Some guy, one of our friends on the GW boards said I said something about..."
2299.88,2302.6, I sound like...
2302.6,2304.64, Something terrible I can't recall.
2304.64,2307.08," Somebody was making fun of my voice on the boards, bro."
2307.08,2309.08," At Kat 7, 6 in the Nali."
2309.08,2310.88, They wasn't quite that...
2310.88,2312.08, With people about their wayward.
2312.08,2313.08, I know that you've...
2313.16,2316.7999999999997," Ever since you found that though, you haven't..."
2316.7999999999997,2318.16, You're thinking as fast as I can.
2318.16,2319.16, That's a bit too much.
2319.16,2320.16, That's a bit too much.
2320.16,2322.16, Every time I listen to you.
2322.16,2325.52," Actually, the great thing about Ryan is he's quiet, but then when he lets loose, it's"
2325.52,2328.12," always like this, you know, epic rant."
2328.12,2331.6, Which I thought maybe we were going to get today with this thing that could change everything.
2331.6,2332.6, That happened.
2332.6,2333.6, There.
2333.6,2335.6," Still still a slow boil here, maybe next week."
2335.6,2338.0," Like, if you want to see that, I'll just show you the log."
2338.0,2339.52," All right, I will."
2339.52,2341.52, His blog does the talking.
2341.52,2342.52, Got damn right.
2342.96,2344.48," Okay, we're done."
2344.48,2347.36," Skip, thanks for producing us today."
2347.36,2351.16," Oh, oh, do we have any ideas for contest for..."
2351.16,2352.16," Oh, yeah."
2352.16,2353.16," Oh, I don't really know."
2353.16,2354.96, That's why the only reason people are still listening.
2354.96,2355.96," Oh, yeah."
2355.96,2356.96, How about this?
2356.96,2358.24, We're going to make it easy.
2358.24,2363.52," Go to our forums, which is what GFW.1up.com boards."
2363.52,2365.52, Boardboards.com.com.com.
2365.52,2367.72, We're going to give it a game for Windows.
2367.72,2370.0, And we'll make a thread.
2370.0,2371.28, I'll go right now.
2371.28,2372.28, So it'll be up.
2372.28,2374.84, I'll preem to the release of the podcast.
2374.84,2379.2000000000003," It's called Win Burning Crusade, Collectors Edition."
2379.2000000000003,2381.32, And I'll put the terms in there.
2381.32,2383.84, I'll give me another five more minutes to think about this.
