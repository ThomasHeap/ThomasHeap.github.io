13.0,16.0, Hello and welcome!
16.0,18.0, Once again to GFW Radio.
18.0,19.0, We are back!
19.0,23.0," After a week's break, we were off at E3 and now we have returned."
23.0,26.0," While Ryan you never left, but you're back anyway."
26.0,27.0, Yay!
27.0,28.0, Yay!
28.0,31.0," By the way, you didn't stage your coup de Taw while we were gone."
31.0,33.0, I came back and I was still boss.
33.0,34.0, What's up with that?
34.0,35.0, Did your big chance?
35.0,36.0, There.
36.0,37.0, That's playing while we...
37.0,39.0, That's great.
39.0,43.0, At least you were playing a game for once on the PC.
43.0,44.0, Yep.
44.0,45.0, So there's a start.
45.0,46.0, There's so pretty yet.
46.0,48.0, We're all here.
48.0,49.0, That was Ryan Scott.
49.0,51.0, You heard also with us today are...
51.0,53.0, Daring Gladstone?
53.0,54.0, Sean Elliott.
54.0,56.0, Sean Maloy.
56.0,58.0," And me, Jeff Green."
58.0,61.0, Sean Maloy is looking extra intelligent today because he's wanting glasses.
61.0,62.0, I'm sure I had...
62.0,63.0, It's the new Sean Maloy.
63.0,64.0, What was it?
64.0,65.0, The old Sean Maloy.
65.0,66.0, Okay.
66.0,67.0, I lost them two years ago.
67.0,70.0, And then I found them again and realized I see much better with them.
70.0,72.0, I put them back on.
72.0,74.0, So you weren't using contacts this whole time.
74.0,77.0," So the guy who reads the magazine more closely than anyone, every..."
77.0,79.0," No, no, that's for distance."
79.0,80.0, Okay.
80.0,82.0, These articles look great.
82.0,84.0, So we're here.
85.0,87.0, We're here.
87.0,88.0, Hi.
88.0,89.0, That's a...
89.0,90.0, Yeah.
90.0,91.0, Let's do it.
91.0,94.0, We had an exhausting week except for Ryan.
94.0,95.0, I guess.
95.0,96.0," Oh, I had an exhausting week too."
96.0,98.0," Yeah, it really sounds like it."
98.0,100.0, I had to edit all of the...
100.0,101.0, You guys just previews.
101.0,102.0," Oh, I'm sorry."
102.0,103.0, You ready E3?
103.0,105.0," Yeah, we were kind of mailing it in too."
105.0,106.0, Yeah.
106.0,107.0, It looked better when I was drawing.
107.0,108.0, Writing it.
108.0,110.0," Yeah, I was in drunk as it's tired."
110.0,111.0, I was so overdue.
111.0,113.0," I, Chris been a boy from Ejamin."
113.0,116.0, I actually suggested that our violence be the internet.
116.0,117.0, That way we would have it.
117.0,119.0," We were talking about, uh..."
119.0,120.0, I don't know.
120.0,121.0, That's what our name is.
121.0,122.0, Catched it.
122.0,123.0, But it was fine though.
123.0,125.0," And we kept our violence and we just stayed up late, right?"
125.0,126.0, And I'm...
126.0,127.0, Keep you honest.
127.0,129.0," Yeah, I didn't need a byline on that stuff."
129.0,130.0, Yeah.
130.0,134.0, You gotta get the side of anything I wrote.
134.0,136.0, You did better than many people.
136.0,137.0, Whatever.
137.0,138.0, What's the other side?
138.0,140.0," What's the other side, John?"
140.0,142.0," Well, just the world of online."
142.0,144.0," You know, I mean, you need the text up that moment."
144.0,150.0," And I think that the thing, you know, not to disparage it because there's a wide variety of stories that will appear online and people want."
150.0,156.0," But I think especially during this convention, if you look at the discussions and message boards and wherever else,"
156.0,157.0, Yeah.
157.0,159.0, People just wanted the fact she wanted it.
159.0,160.0, They wanted it at the bottom.
160.0,161.0, Yeah.
161.0,162.0," Like, the conversation."
162.0,166.0," How excited are you for it, you know, and is this not actually the name care about that?"
166.0,168.0, Is this the best game at the show or is it not?
168.0,171.0, And it's only like five things that you can do in the game.
171.0,173.0," You know, I mean, and really so."
173.0,181.0," And if you're a fallout fan, if there was, if you're a fallout fan, there's one thing you could have learned about this game that didn't make you want to hate it."
181.0,184.0," Billy, I'm just saying, I actually like it a lot."
184.0,189.0," I'm talking about the fallout message boards, which we're a flame with hatred no matter what you said."
189.0,194.0," And on my blog too, everything is further proof that this game is going to suck."
194.0,195.0, I feel sorry for those guys.
195.0,197.0, Let's just dig right into that.
197.0,200.0," Yeah, let's go into, let's go into fallout."
200.0,204.0," Well, what do they, what do they got there, panties in the bunch over?"
204.0,205.0, Everything.
205.0,206.0, It doesn't matter.
206.0,209.0, Everything is further signed that Bethesda is going to fuck it up.
209.0,214.0," The fan, this is one of those games where I like with fans like these, you know, there is no defense."
214.0,215.0, Who needs enemies?
215.0,216.0, Yeah.
216.0,218.0," So basically, there is never seen so much hate."
218.0,221.0," It's like, they expected to be just turned based or nothing, basically."
221.0,222.0, Is it a sound like?
223.0,224.0, It's sort of that.
224.0,226.0, It's sort of they don't like the perspective.
226.0,228.0," They don't, you know, they don't like that."
228.0,230.0, It's going to be played out that way.
230.0,232.0, They don't like the Bethesda's doing it.
232.0,238.0, Everything that was wrong with oblivion and previous games is proof that they're going to fuck up this game according to them.
238.0,240.0," I mean, that's where I differ right away."
240.0,243.0, Is I do think oblivion is quite excellent.
243.0,246.0," And if you don't, well, you obviously don't understand fallout then, Sean."
246.0,250.0, You don't understand intricacies of the vault.
250.0,254.0," I don't know, like the, I don't know how to appease him."
254.0,256.0, I see that's the thing.
256.0,257.0," You know, there is no appeasing."
257.0,258.0, Yeah.
258.0,259.0, They're trying to appease the internet.
259.0,261.0, They are determined to hate this game.
261.0,262.0, It's the same principle.
262.0,265.0, I'm used to seeing it in the multiplayer shooter space.
265.0,268.0, And this is a chance to actually bring up the fact that we weren't for a magazine.
268.0,272.0," But, you know, our next GFW interview is with Paul Wedgewood of Splash Damage."
272.0,275.0," But one thing that he pointed out, which I found interesting, is that"
275.0,278.0," very similarly, you make a game."
278.0,279.0, It does well.
279.0,282.0, People do not want it to change to the point.
282.0,285.0," And I can vouch for this, you know, where even a patch, there are people that"
285.0,287.0, as soon as a new patch comes out.
287.0,289.0, You get the same kind of message board reaction set.
289.0,291.0," You're describing, but oh, God, they don't know."
291.0,292.0, Dice doesn't know anything.
292.0,293.0, They ruined it again.
293.0,295.0," We're not, we're reverting to the old patch."
295.0,298.0, And everyone he wants to play the real game stay with us.
298.0,299.0, Right.
299.0,303.0, But then what he said that I found funny was that when they first made Wolf and Stein
303.0,307.0," and a military, everyone was like, Oh, this is, we don't want anything to do with"
307.0,308.0, this.
308.0,311.0," This isn't the real multiplayer wolf and Stein, you know, that shipped with the game."
311.0,315.0, And then of course Wolf and Stein amin territory became massive.
315.0,316.0, Yeah.
316.0,317.0, Everyone loved it.
317.0,319.0," And then now it's like, Oh, God, this game's already perfect."
319.0,322.0, And instead of why didn't they just remake that with better graphics?
322.0,325.0, Where are they fucking it all up with break wars and stuff?
325.0,326.0, Yeah.
326.0,327.0, Yeah.
327.0,328.0, They don't even over again.
328.0,330.0," No matter what the game is, I'm sure with MMOs, it's the same way."
330.0,333.0," And there's just a certain, I mean, I don't know what it is about people."
333.0,335.0, They find something they like it and love it.
335.0,340.0," And they think it's supposed to be, you know, just like Lenin and his old, you know, Waxi, Waxi."
340.0,343.0, It's been a 10 years since the last Fallout game.
343.0,346.0, There's guys who have been on that on the Fallout message boards ever since.
346.0,347.0, Right.
347.0,349.0," You know, it's still like, it's still like Fallout."
349.0,350.0, Yeah.
350.0,353.0," It's like they're just hoping for more like, you know, a followed expansion pack."
353.0,354.0, Yeah.
354.0,355.0, Yeah.
355.0,356.0, That's kind of true.
356.0,360.0," I mean, in less Tim Kane and that those original developers were making the exact sequel"
360.0,361.0, to the next game.
361.0,364.0, I just think there was no way that this wasn't going to feel like a betrayal to them.
364.0,365.0, And then they haven't seen it.
365.0,366.0, They just heard about it.
366.0,367.0, They're listening.
367.0,368.0, Right.
368.0,371.0, There's really honestly has to be in that much about the game yet.
371.0,373.0," I mean, someone was telling someone on my blog."
373.0,378.0, I wrote about it on my blog and I said something about the humor and a poster on my
378.0,381.0," blogs and something about, well, it looks to me just like the humor."
381.0,383.0, It's like totally juvenile.
383.0,389.0," And I was like, you know, the amount of dialogue they've even released to show off what"
389.0,391.0, the humor is going to be like in the game.
391.0,393.0, It's like 0.0 0 0 1.
393.0,396.0," And I was like, you know, I'm like, what are you, what are you, what are you basing that on?"
396.0,397.0, And I want the guy who's out.
397.0,400.0," But his response to that was, okay, yeah, there's that."
400.0,405.0," But Todd Howard, who's the lead developer, he was he gave an interview at E3."
405.0,410.0," You know, he was demoing the game for all of us and one of those, one of those demos."
410.0,414.0," The transcript showed up online and he was making, you know, some pretty dumb jokes."
414.0,415.0, Some kind of juvenile jokes.
415.0,418.0," And I said, this is just a guy sitting in a room with a bunch of journalists."
418.0,420.0, It's just like talking off his the cuff.
420.0,423.0, That's not representative of what's going to be in the game.
423.0,425.0, But this guy took that as proof of that.
425.0,426.0," Do you mean, how are you?"
426.0,428.0," I mean, I want to do it."
428.0,433.0, I want to go back and play Fallout 2 and just see how with it all the jokes were.
433.0,436.0," Well, that was what other people, I mean,"
436.0,440.0," I included about the people I wanted to back to was like, there was some pretty juvenile humor in those games."
440.0,441.0, Exactly.
441.0,442.0," I mean, they're coloring the past."
442.0,443.0, They're probably.
443.0,444.0, Yeah.
444.0,445.0, It's all rose colored glasses.
445.0,447.0," I mean, you know,"
447.0,453.0," I think that Fallout 3, you know, from Bethesda here does have a lot to prove."
453.0,457.0, I think I thought they gave a great demo of D3.
457.0,458.0, I run on my blog.
458.0,459.0, It was a game.
459.0,462.0," I'm not going to do a best of show or whatever, but it was definitely the game."
462.0,465.0, I felt like I most wanted to play when we got out of there.
465.0,467.0, Here's the life of this happening.
467.0,472.0, As people are freaking out and hating on this game where they did show 45 minutes plus of actual gameplay.
472.0,473.0, Yeah.
473.0,478.0, And then they're freaking out going nuts for like how awesome a freaking third trailer for Metal Gear Solid 4 is.
478.0,482.0," You know, someone declared a website declared that."
482.0,488.0," I don't have the exact wording right, but the greatest game that God's Earth will ever give to us."
488.0,489.0," Oh, yeah."
489.0,491.0, I was at the thing she was in a course.
491.0,493.0," Yeah, so you're on to laugh at it."
493.0,496.0," But of course, yeah, they show it again and so and out there."
496.0,497.0," No, that's game."
497.0,498.0," Yeah, okay."
498.0,499.0," It's in the engine, but we're talking about demos."
499.0,501.0, It's what it means to play the game.
501.0,503.0," And that sense, it's a congima game."
503.0,505.0, That is a pretty big part of what it means to play out the game.
505.0,506.0, So watch cutscenes.
506.0,508.0," No, not against because they know that's all right."
508.0,512.0," But at the same time, even when you joke, I mean, that's it."
512.0,515.0, That's only like whatever one ate that experience or something.
515.0,516.0, Me.
516.0,517.0, Yeah.
517.0,518.0, Yeah.
518.0,522.0, That's the thing with this whole show being PC only.
522.0,523.0, We get it.
523.0,525.0, We get away from it at times.
525.0,526.0," You know, the whole lot."
527.0,531.0," Just so I guess fan ways, again, and and platform wars and stuff."
531.0,536.0," But, you know, being back in the context of E3, it just reminded me of how ugly it all is."
536.0,542.0," When you look at message boards, suddenly you're seeing people in the office that don't know a fucking rat's ass about like a genre."
542.0,545.0, And I'm only in all cousin because it's like FPS.
545.0,550.0," But, and there's suddenly declaring, you know, kill zones the best thing I've ever seen or whatever."
550.0,554.0," You know, like you might be someone that would have said the same thing about resistance,"
554.0,557.0," but having never actually played resistance even after it came out, you know."
557.0,560.0," But you just see a lot of, it's just so weird."
560.0,566.0," You just see how irrational we are in the things we like and the way that we have, you know,"
566.0,569.0, the way our opinions are formed and this and that.
569.0,573.0," And there's this other thing about it, too, is that we know it's following it online,"
573.0,579.0," which was interesting this year, because I did feel I had a better sense of the big picture by looking at message boards."
579.0,587.0, But there's such an intense emphasis on the business and economics of the industry.
587.0,597.0," Right. So, you know, I mean, there's just massive, massive words thrown into arguments about if something's cheap enough,"
597.0,601.0," if it's not cheap enough, if they're going to make money, are they going to sell enough units?"
601.0,603.0, Are they had or they behind?
604.0,612.0," And, you know, while you will occasionally see, you know, there's a list, there's always a list of the charts for movies or billboard and music and rolling stone or something."
612.0,621.0," But you don't have the majority of, you know, those magazines and those mediums coverage is not all about the business and the economics of it."
621.0,628.0," It's more centered on the artist and the art, the sexual stuff and it, and so that's definitely still there."
628.0,633.0," It's not like it vanished, but I was just trying to make sense, but why is that? Why is it that we define it?"
633.0,637.0," Because we certainly define it, I guess maybe because we're able to define ourselves with the music we listen to,"
637.0,642.0," but here it's like the choice we go for a platform or something, this says who I am."
642.0,645.0," So, yeah, it's going to, you know, I'm going to defend it till the very end."
645.0,649.0," And this is, but at that end, that would be the same in music, right?"
649.0,652.0, I'm a metal head. I'm whatever.
652.0,657.0," Yeah, but that's, but even go even more specific and say like, I'm, I'm strictly bad boy."
657.0,660.0," If it's not about, if it's not on no limit, I am playing."
660.0,666.0," I mean, if that kind of crap, you know, or, and then because of it, the, that, that means that the very,"
666.0,677.0," say the very next album that no limit puts out within in your mind, it would come, you would be that much more likely to think it's incredible than if it had come out on."
677.0,679.0, Atlantic or whatever.
679.0,682.0, Mercury.
682.0,686.0," I don't know. That was a diversion, but it was, it just kind of, it just kind of got to me."
686.0,694.0," I was just wondering what, was it trying to figure out what it is about, or what is it about gaming industry that makes it such a draw the,"
694.0,697.0," the, just the business end of the whole, of the whole bargain."
697.0,700.0," We're all, that's a good question. I don't know."
700.0,704.0," I mean, you do find that in, in more in the movie industry and TV."
704.0,708.0," I mean, like entertainment weekly now, to me, they focus a lot more on like the box of"
708.0,718.0," us and things like that. Okay. Who's do people like, I mean, I just saw an article somewhere online today about how the so called torture porn."
718.0,722.0, genre has played out now because hostile to took a big drop.
722.0,728.0," Right. Second week and new dumb ass movie with captivity that captivity movie with, well, it's a, what's her name?"
728.0,732.0," Elisha Cuffbert, whatever her name is from 24 tanked in the first week."
732.0,737.0," So now, I think it's like to use, you know, using his TV, it's for like what they're going to be playing or watching in the future."
737.0,741.0," Maybe like, you know, if this does tang, just like, well, I guess that's the end of the time."
741.0,745.0," And even that, you see, that's even different because then that would be like saying, let's know,"
745.0,749.0, a number of first person shooters made excellent showings this year.
749.0,753.0," And let's look at that trend. Is this, you know, and we always think, okay, that was the year of,"
753.0,758.0," yeah, yes, is it, it has to be about ready to crest its curve, but then here it is again."
758.0,766.0," That's just different than, I don't know, just sort of, I think it's, often I think it's a sort of just trying to justify the machine that you bought."
766.0,770.0," I think it is. I spent the money on the PS3, therefore the PS3 must be the best machine."
770.0,776.0," Right. You don't have that, you don't have that unless, you know, you're dealing with blue or an HD DVD or something."
776.0,780.0," Then people bend in that industry, people start getting defensive about that."
780.0,783.0, That's the point. There's a sense of ownership.
783.0,789.0," I mean, like, you can look at gaming, music sports. I mean, hello, I'm a jet fan for life and they suck as all hell, but, right."
789.0,792.0," I mean, there's always, everyone, as it, it finds an attachment to something."
792.0,798.0," There's a stunt ride, Sega fanboy during the Genesis era because that's all I had and then I bought an SNES."
798.0,800.0," And suddenly, I liked them both."
800.0,804.0," You have to see, gauge me, I went and launched it at PS3, so you have to see it."
804.0,806.0, Did you really change?
806.0,812.0," Yeah, I went to get a Wii and they still didn't have it. So I, I got mad and I was like, alright, it's like July."
812.0,815.0, You guys still can't get this thing in the store. Fuck you.
815.0,818.0," I'm not gonna buy it. So I just bought the other, because I already had a few."
818.0,820.0, Now you can't play with the shit.
820.0,824.0," Yeah, I got the, it was on sales, 599 bucks."
824.0,825.0," Oh, that's a bar."
825.0,826.0, That's a cheap one.
826.0,827.0, I'm just playing now.
827.0,828.0, Of course.
828.0,829.0, I'm gonna get the right one.
829.0,834.0," You know, and if you three went, when we first checked into our hotel, there was a guy doing some"
834.0,838.0," Grout work in the bathroom and he overheard Chris, when he was talking."
838.0,839.0, Yeah.
839.0,843.0," And he's like, you guys working video games. You know, I hear you guys working video games."
843.0,845.0, Can you tell me what console it should get?
845.0,848.0, And so we're talking to him and it turns out he just bought two days prior.
848.0,851.0," He bought a PS3 and we were like, oh, shit man."
851.0,854.0, Because it was like the day that they had to have a fries drop.
854.0,855.0, Wow.
855.0,856.0, I bought mine a month ago.
856.0,858.0," You know, but you know that swap it out."
858.0,859.0," The hard drives, right?"
859.0,861.0," Yeah, I don't, I can have that."
861.0,862.0, If the time comes where I need more.
862.0,863.0, I'm not near that either.
863.0,865.0, I'll just pick up my knee games.
865.0,866.0, I can do that.
866.0,871.0," But I borrowed from E. James, awesome library borrowed resistance, motor storm and darkness."
871.0,873.0, So I can continue to be.
873.0,876.0, I think I got mad when I saw someone on a message board post.
876.0,879.0," I was like, okay, well, Sean knows PC FPS."
879.0,881.0, So and so knows console one.
881.0,882.0," I was like, shit man."
882.0,885.0, That's what all those years of reviewing every single console.
885.0,886.0, FES ever made.
886.0,887.0, Got me.
887.0,889.0, So I got to go play more.
889.0,892.0," No, the other thing with Darren, you mentioned sports."
892.0,895.0," You know, that was one of their kind of like cock and maybe idea."
895.0,898.0," I had is just that I think, you know, when you're die hard sports man,"
898.0,902.0, you feel this sort of empowerment in being like the RBI king or whatever.
902.0,905.0," You know, every little bit you have an excellent command of every statistical."
905.0,907.0, Detail that that's available.
907.0,909.0, Maybe it's something like that too.
909.0,910.0," I mean, you just."
910.0,914.0," Uh, some other sense of empowerment or like I could tell you that this happened in this"
914.0,918.0, month and this company's stockholders sent a memorandum.
918.0,919.0, So it's so.
919.0,922.0," No, but I think everybody's a geek over something."
922.0,924.0, They want to claim fee for them over.
924.0,927.0, There's this little turf that they should they can feel like an expert over it.
927.0,931.0, But what in the world be a better place if we just all agreed that we're all the same.
932.0,934.0," No, we're all geeked."
934.0,937.0," No, I think you better be talking about the games about the god damn fuck."
937.0,938.0, I agree there.
938.0,942.0," The machine that required hearing one console and you know, room having the same"
942.0,943.0, console blah blah blah.
943.0,945.0," Well, hopefully Microsoft will just own us all one day."
945.0,948.0," God, I hope that's their plan about the game."
948.0,950.0, So what else do we get going?
950.0,954.0, Fallout was made a favorable impression on me.
954.0,955.0," Yeah, not on the fans."
955.0,956.0, No.
956.0,958.0," Uh, what else did we last?"
958.0,960.0, I think we all saw Bio Shark at some point.
960.0,962.0, Bio Shark looked awesome.
962.0,963.0, Mm-hmm.
963.0,964.0, My name is Bio Shark right now.
964.0,966.0, That was I've seen so little on the game.
966.0,971.0," I've like avoided like basically reading anything about it, even in our own man."
971.0,973.0, And now it's so close to coming out.
973.0,974.0, I just don't want to know.
974.0,976.0," Yeah, the moment I was like a little late on the way."
976.0,977.0, So just play it.
977.0,978.0, Go on radio sounds.
978.0,979.0, It's like I don't want the spoilers.
979.0,983.0, I had been hearing so much about it and editing stories about it.
983.0,988.0," Um, and it was this was the first time I had actually watched some play."
988.0,989.0, It's since last E3.
989.0,990.0, Yeah.
990.0,994.0," And when I did, it was kind of like, I got to this point where I'm like, okay, I accept that this is something I'm interested in."
994.0,996.0, Everything I hear about it sounds fascinating.
996.0,1002.0," You know, Sean's preview made a very, you know, excellent case for why I should want to pay attention to it."
1002.0,1005.0," But then when, you know, we sat down and saw it again."
1005.0,1007.0," It was just immediate like, oh, God."
1007.0,1008.0, I gotta have this.
1008.0,1009.0, Yeah.
1009.0,1010.0, This is just so cool.
1010.0,1011.0, There's so many things.
1011.0,1013.0," Unfortunately, we watched."
1013.0,1017.0," I think there's some rule that when you're demonstrating a game, you have to be like one of the worst."
1018.0,1020.0, One of the least coordinated people in the world.
1020.0,1022.0, And so we're watching the game show on for something.
1022.0,1024.0," Yeah, Sean and I were in Sam demo."
1024.0,1027.0," I mean, you know, he's trying to fight a big daddy."
1027.0,1030.0," And at the same time, guys are clubbing them over the back of the head."
1030.0,1035.0, And the game itself is doing its damn just to tell them that something bad's happening to him from behind.
1035.0,1042.0," I mean, so you know, you're getting the flashes on the screen saying, hey, dude, you might want to turn around and see about shooting this guy."
1042.0,1044.0," And then, you know, flashing on the screen is like, press beat."
1044.0,1046.0, You're here yourself.
1046.0,1049.0," And over and over again, like, you might want to press B."
1049.0,1056.0," But still, nonetheless, while you're watching and play and he is cycling through some of the abilities and stuff."
1056.0,1059.0," I'm looking at it saying, okay, here's what I would do."
1059.0,1062.0," And that was because you, everyone does that when they watch him and play a game anyway."
1062.0,1063.0," Well, I would do this."
1063.0,1068.0," But you could see, oh, what would happen if he tried this and just looking at the environment,"
1069.0,1078.0," looking at the ways that the AI was behaving and considering his arsenal both of the plasma powers and you know, weapons."
1078.0,1079.0, It is just great.
1079.0,1087.0," And you're like, okay, I know that this, you know, I've read enough to know that, you know, you can put an electrical current through water to shock someone."
1087.0,1090.0, You can hack a drone or something.
1090.0,1093.0, And all these various combinations of that.
1093.0,1095.0," I think it would be again, that's infuriating to watch."
1095.0,1097.0, Even if someone competent was playing it.
1097.0,1100.0," Why, just as you wanted to do this because I would want to do some reverting."
1100.0,1101.0, I don't do that.
1101.0,1102.0, That's why.
1102.0,1103.0," Anyway, yeah."
1103.0,1110.0," And of course, the environment, the fiction that it's selling through its art is just doing a great job of it."
1110.0,1116.0," I mean, when you come out of looking at like halo three or something and you see that, it's just, okay, this is awesome."
1116.0,1126.0," This is not an environment that we've, I mean, who basically is like, let's take John Gaul's, you know, and Randy and dystopia put it under water and make a shooting video game out of it."
1126.0,1128.0," Yeah, that's just genius."
1128.0,1129.0, Yeah.
1129.0,1134.0," Something else about that I watched them play on the controller, you know, they were playing 360 version."
1134.0,1137.0, I'm sure you can use control on PC if you're so inclined.
1137.0,1146.0," But because of the way that you are cycling with the bumper buttons through his available weapons and because of the variety of weapons and plasma powers available to them,"
1146.0,1150.0," I was already thinking like, oh, this is going to be hot on PC where I could key each of these to a number."
1150.0,1152.0," And that way, I can combo them."
1152.0,1157.0," So, you know, say for example, you might become an intern environment where rockets are coming at you or anything."
1157.0,1164.0," You might not be prepared for it, but rather than having the cycle through, you know, your split second to slow, oh, here's a rocket."
1164.0,1166.0, I can use telekinesis to catch it midair.
1166.0,1170.0," But by the time you work your way to that power, it's too late and it's smack you in the face."
1170.0,1172.0," So here, you're right, three, boom."
1172.0,1179.0," And then mouse click one and I've suddenly acquired control of this rocket and can send it back, redirect it, do whatever."
1179.0,1180.0," Yeah, because you're a lot more reactionary."
1180.0,1181.0, At least in my reckoning.
1181.0,1183.0," I thought they were showing it on PC, you know."
1183.0,1186.0," Well, I think they were at that Microsoft event."
1186.0,1187.0, They did.
1187.0,1188.0," Yeah, yeah."
1188.0,1194.0, We were actually at another hotel where we saw it.
1194.0,1195.0, Okay.
1195.0,1196.0, Yeah.
1196.0,1197.0, It's all over the place.
1197.0,1201.0," Speaking of which, I can top your lame demo story with another lame."
1201.0,1203.0," Actually, I didn't see it, but I heard about it."
1203.0,1208.0, That there was a Microsoft person who was trying to demo crisis.
1208.0,1211.0, And she was moving the mouse.
1211.0,1212.0, And she didn't ever hand on the keyboard.
1212.0,1215.0," And she was going, I can't time move forward or backward."
1215.0,1217.0, He was just moving the mouse.
1217.0,1218.0, Just moving the mouse.
1218.0,1219.0, Yeah.
1219.0,1224.0," But she was there to not just test it, but to show you what it's like."
1224.0,1226.0, It's pretty fantastic.
1226.0,1228.0, What's on on a bathroom record?
1228.0,1234.0," So you know, you spent, and they spent however many months preparing this, you know, this chunk of level."
1234.0,1238.0, They're making it presentable and doing what they can to fix bugs and stuff.
1238.0,1239.0, And then you have that.
1239.0,1241.0, And then they got someone from the short button.
1241.0,1245.0," And that's a game where, you know, really anyone can play in the, and you're going to walk up and go,"
1245.0,1247.0," Wow, this is a good looking game."
1247.0,1248.0, Right.
1248.0,1253.0," But I found, you know, there's so much you can do in that game that it really will help to have someone on there that's demonstrating."
1253.0,1259.0," They have the right person on there that says, hey, well, I know that if I bloody someone up and throw them out in the ocean,"
1259.0,1261.0, a shark's going to come and eat them.
1261.0,1262.0, But this chick.
1263.0,1269.0," Well, friends, let's do let's have me, you know, there and not me, it's so to speak to guy that, you know, that was at the key."
1269.0,1272.0, I was that I didn't park your hanger where I was watching it.
1272.0,1276.0," You know, I felt that way about the whole Microsoft press conference, which was probably been talked about the death,"
1276.0,1284.0," but we could do it a little bit here, but I felt that, you know, they put it in this gigantic outdoor stadium, which was just a fantastic local."
1284.0,1289.0," I mean, I don't know, what kind of money that high school had, but that thing was a big scam, which I was going to say."
1289.0,1294.0," I was thinking like, man, if this was only the pixie instead of, so I was like, I'm not fucking great."
1294.0,1298.0," I heard that I heard that Peter Moore unveiled the new Xbox model, the Thunderous Silence."
1298.0,1299.0," Yeah, we'll see that."
1299.0,1300.0, It's a point.
1300.0,1301.0, It needed to pass the point out.
1301.0,1303.0," It's going to make him, you glued his aside."
1303.0,1309.0," This is the point I was going to make was that here they have this audience in this, this amazing local,"
1309.0,1314.0, and they've got truly a great lineup coming up and great information.
1314.0,1317.0, The press conference in the way was such like a whiff.
1317.0,1323.0," I just thought, like, just in your way of saying like, they got all this ready for the show, and then they had someone lame demo it."
1323.0,1330.0," It's like they had all these resources, all the money it took to get the stadium up, all the time to prepare a decent presentation."
1330.0,1334.0," And then it was so tin-eared and there were so many like clunker lines, and it's like,"
1334.0,1339.0," who was in charge of this that they didn't like it needed a better director or something, you know?"
1339.0,1343.0, Someone that like cut the cheesy parts and pace it better.
1343.0,1350.0," You know, we were all sitting there like, wah, wah, wah, it was like, you know, a bad stand-up comic that you kept like everyone's like looking down like,"
1350.0,1351.0, Yeah.
1351.0,1353.0, There was any for a cricket sound effect at some point.
1353.0,1355.0, There were moments.
1355.0,1360.0," I mean, really, the truth is like the game is kind of overwhelmed the lameness of the presentation."
1360.0,1363.0, So there was cool stuff that we could go on onto.
1363.0,1366.0," But the speaker, I actually liked Peter Moore, I thought he was pretty good."
1366.0,1367.0, Yeah.
1367.0,1369.0, I thought that you guys have this conversation because I basically-
1369.0,1370.0, You've done it already.
1370.0,1371.0, You've done it already.
1371.0,1373.0," Well, we're probably like the 20th podcast about this."
1373.0,1374.0, Yeah.
1374.0,1375.0, Maybe we don't need to go on.
1375.0,1376.0," No, we can."
1376.0,1379.0," But they did show off a bunch of games that are coming out this year, which is the important part that-"
1379.0,1381.0, I thought that message was cool.
1381.0,1383.0," Yeah, their main message, like-"
1383.0,1384.0," Well, yeah, I mean, that was it's pleasant."
1384.0,1389.0," That was like the double edged sword of that was no exciting new announcements,"
1389.0,1394.0," but when it hits home that all this really is like within your grasp, there you go."
1394.0,1395.0," Okay, that's pretty damn cool."
1395.0,1396.0, Mm-hmm.
1396.0,1398.0, I did like the rock band demo.
1398.0,1400.0, Kind of made me want to get the game though.
1400.0,1403.0, I'm still skeptical of the practicality of that thing.
1403.0,1406.0, Kind of made me afraid of where that start button is located.
1406.0,1407.0, Composing it.
1407.0,1411.0," You like the rock band demo where the game, you have to accidentally-"
1411.0,1413.0, We're first Peter-
1413.0,1414.0, Composing every five seconds.
1414.0,1417.0," That was part of the game for, you know, writing enough notes."
1417.0,1422.0," Well, my main concern is that the drums were so cool that that's all anybody would want to play."
1422.0,1426.0, Every- every- you get your friends together and everybody's going to want to play drums.
1426.0,1428.0, So you're going to see a crack- going to want to play the bass-play.
1428.0,1429.0, It's a bass.
1429.0,1432.0," See, see Craig's like posting his favorite like drummer wants it for rock band?"
1432.0,1434.0, They can see Joe Rebicke's uh- block by the way.
1434.0,1435.0," No, it was-"
1435.0,1436.0," Yeah, former opium editor-"
1436.0,1437.0," Oh, now, three months."
1437.0,1438.0," Yeah, we're awesome."
1438.0,1439.0," Yeah, that was awesome."
1439.0,1441.0," Yeah, that was like a public service announcement."
1441.0,1444.0, You open it up in the message was uh-
1444.0,1447.0, It spelled B-A-S-S.
1447.0,1449.0, That was like the whole message.
1449.0,1450.0, Nice.
1451.0,1453.0, Bass guitar at the ASE.
1453.0,1454.0, That was.
1454.0,1456.0, Welcome to the internet.
1456.0,1458.0, You're going to try to realize it because editorial-
1458.0,1459.0, Yeah.
1459.0,1460.0, You should have changed it to for all-
1460.0,1462.0, Intensive purposes.
1462.0,1466.0, And then they had that-
1466.0,1467.0," Yeah, they're-"
1467.0,1469.0," Goddamn, uh, Ron Co. salesman."
1469.0,1471.0," Oh, trying to pedal the-"
1471.0,1474.0," The cash-ro games, which is just wrong on so many-"
1474.0,1475.0, Watch out.
1475.0,1476.0, Watch out.
1476.0,1477.0, Watch out.
1477.0,1478.0, You just push a bunch.
1479.0,1481.0, I know that's exactly how you do this on what I want to be yours.
1481.0,1482.0, Yeah.
1482.0,1484.0," The first day, the first week, the first show last week."
1484.0,1485.0, Yeah.
1485.0,1487.0, Plus I've had this conversation like-
1487.0,1489.0, Every hour on the hour during E3.
1489.0,1490.0, It was like so many names.
1490.0,1491.0, The guy you bring on-
1491.0,1494.0, Here's the part where I call him the King of all real estate
1494.0,1496.0, from American beauty.
1496.0,1498.0," Someone else called him, uh, you know,"
1498.0,1500.0, time-share salesman and this and that-
1500.0,1502.0, Do you think he gives a shit if he's hurt all this?
1502.0,1503.0, I don't-
1503.0,1505.0, I don't think he cares because I mean-
1505.0,1507.0, There's only a string full of money.
1507.0,1508.0, I-I-He probably does-
1508.0,1510.0, That makes you not care about a lot of things.
1510.0,1511.0, Yeah.
1511.0,1512.0, Yeah.
1512.0,1513.0, That sucks the care right out of the room.
1513.0,1515.0, And give me attention to this.
1515.0,1516.0, It's all the matters.
1516.0,1517.0, All right.
1517.0,1518.0," Well, so I'll fuck that."
1518.0,1519.0, Thank you.
1519.0,1520.0, It's been done.
1520.0,1521.0, When the taken out of the room-
1521.0,1522.0, What else were we playing?
1522.0,1524.0," We were just talking about, uh,"
1524.0,1527.0," by a shot, a little mention of crisis demo."
1527.0,1528.0, What else do we like?
1528.0,1530.0," Are we buying the hype of, uh,"
1530.0,1533.0," Call of Duty 4 because the show certainly, uh,"
1533.0,1535.0, became Call of Duty 4.
1535.0,1536.0, Love fast by that end of the week there.
1536.0,1537.0, It totally did.
1537.0,1538.0, It sure looks good.
1538.0,1540.0, That's good salesmanship right there if anything.
1540.0,1541.0, Mm-hmm.
1541.0,1542.0, That excellent demo.
1542.0,1543.0," Uh, for that-"
1543.0,1544.0," Yeah, look really good."
1544.0,1547.0," It's odd because, you know, we had seen in a private show"
1547.0,1550.0," and many months ago, uh, those levels and more."
1550.0,1551.0, And it was-
1551.0,1553.0," We all were like, yeah, this is-"
1553.0,1554.0, This is definitely cool.
1554.0,1555.0," But it was like, this is-"
1555.0,1557.0," This is exactly what I'd expect, you know?"
1557.0,1559.0," I was like, in fin-any-d-word, Call of Duty,"
1559.0,1561.0," Contemporary Combat setting went there,"
1561.0,1564.0," like, exactly what I was expecting to see."
1564.0,1567.0," But then now, once, uh, it's shown to the world,"
1567.0,1569.0," suddenly, uh, it's kind of-"
1569.0,1572.0, It really was kind of like the most talked about if not the-
1572.0,1575.0," I mean, certainly one of the most talked about games of the show."
1575.0,1576.0," I mean, I-"
1576.0,1577.0, Sure.
1577.0,1580.0," I mean, I-"
1580.0,1583.0," I mean, thinking it will probably, you know, when they do all those various awards, we like to harp on it, we'll probably be, you know, crown game of the show."
1583.0,1584.0," Oh, yeah."
1584.0,1585.0," Oh, yeah."
1585.0,1586.0, Yeah.
1586.0,1588.0," Other than, uh, in fin-d-word, and Activision staff, uh,"
1588.0,1592.0," but, yeah, I've said before, it's just puzzling to me that I'm-"
1592.0,1597.0, I'm trying to put my finger on exactly where or what it is about this game that's getting everyone.
1597.0,1598.0, Excited?
1598.0,1605.0," And not just those of us that who are traditionally excited, and, you know, because for me, I was already sign up the moment to set fin-d-word Call, duty, you know?"
1605.0,1607.0," Those are the modern setting help, maybe?"
1607.0,1609.0," I think it does, and I think-"
1609.0,1612.0," I don't know, it's hard to say, you know, I'm wondering, are people-"
1612.0,1621.0," There's definitely a much more muted reaction for Halo this year, and I'm wondering if this is me just being going out on a limb or thinking that it's also kind of like, it's-"
1621.0,1622.0, It's peaked already.
1622.0,1626.0," And I'll tell you what, if you don't partially get it when it went three comes out, but I mean, I know-"
1626.0,1632.0, I think it's partially the clever editing of the people who make these demos and these clips.
1632.0,1639.0," I think that the- at the Microsoft event, the Call of Duty 4 trailer, was like kind of a movie quality."
1639.0,1641.0," The pacing was great, right?"
1641.0,1642.0, Right.
1642.0,1644.0, More moments of total like tense silence or whatever.
1644.0,1645.0, Right.
1645.0,1648.0, And I think people are- the way a movie trailer can do that to you too.
1648.0,1649.0, Yeah.
1649.0,1653.0," It looks like the greatest movie ever, and it turns out to be a piece of shit, but the two-minute trailer ruled."
1653.0,1654.0, Right.
1654.0,1657.0," Well, possibly the Halo trailer, the Halo trailer sucked."
1657.0,1658.0," Yeah, that was a spoiler."
1658.0,1659.0, It was a spoiler for the trailer.
1659.0,1665.0," I didn't see it at the show, but from what I've heard from people who did their, like, oh, it's way better than the trailer was."
1665.0,1666.0, Right.
1666.0,1667.0, I did see it.
1667.0,1671.0," I did get a gameplay demo of Halo 3, and in fact, it looked way better than the trailer."
1671.0,1678.0," And after the demo was over, I was, I mean, I asked the buggy guy, so I was like, why wasn't this stuff in the trailer?"
1678.0,1680.0, Because this makes me want to play your game now.
1680.0,1681.0, Yeah.
1681.0,1683.0, It's just kind of weird.
1683.0,1686.0, But so that makes me think that people get fooled by trailers.
1686.0,1689.0, This is a game of the show because they made it through a matter of course.
1689.0,1694.0," People who are exposed to more footage of C84 than just that, that Microsoft showed their press conference."
1694.0,1695.0, Yeah.
1695.0,1701.0," I mean, they make- if you want to make a quick impact on someone, that's a great game to do it, because it's loud as hell."
1701.0,1702.0, Yeah.
1702.0,1704.0, There's stuff going on everywhere.
1705.0,1713.0," And if you're not really familiar with the conventions in the way that the things assembled and the tricks of the trade, I think you could see it and you're like, this is mind blowing."
1713.0,1720.0," Especially when you compare it to Killzone, which everyone, and that I honestly believe that, you know, not a PC game."
1720.0,1728.0," We're not even remotely related, but it's a game where I think people that have thrown their hat in with Sony and have committed to this is my system."
1728.0,1731.0, This is going to define me as a person.
1731.0,1738.0," Kind of went little- a little apixiate on that one, you know, so I mean, I saw all the stuff in the gameplay that they demonstrated for that."
1738.0,1742.0," It looked far less appealing to me than it called, called D.D.4."
1742.0,1744.0, I keep calling it called D.D.4.
1744.0,1747.0," That's what it's internally known as their, uh, modern combat."
1747.0,1750.0," But I mean, you just see, you know, no real demonstration of AI."
1750.0,1756.0," You just- you see basically guy navigating a maze and guys standing and shooting and, you know, you walk up to him and shoot them."
1756.0,1762.0," If you compare it to the CG that they showed, I still feel that they're- they're needs to be an atonement for that, you know,"
1762.0,1764.0, I can't believe how everyone let it slide.
1764.0,1768.0," And suddenly now, Sony itself is producing like comparison thing."
1768.0,1774.0," It's like, for two years, I mean, when was it that they officially admitted that that thing was CG from the month afterwards, right?"
1774.0,1781.0," I don't think it was that, but as I remember reading in various magazines, stories where they were discussing, you know,"
1781.0,1788.0," it was recently, you know, maybe six months ago where they're discussing the true potential of this platform in this console."
1788.0,1792.0," And what, uh, what at that showing was real and not, and they were still saying it was real."
1792.0,1797.0," You know, you know, the funny thing is about all this though, is like, you're really games that guys behind that."
1797.0,1803.0," I mean, they've made a couple games already and not one of them is backed up this, you know, they have no idea."
1803.0,1805.0," They have no, they did the Vietnam-"
1805.0,1806.0, They've had a glass for the PC.
1806.0,1812.0," Yeah, no pedigree whatsoever that would lead you to believe that they're capable of really, you know, well, truly delivering."
1812.0,1813.0, Right.
1813.0,1815.0," I mean, it's not, it's not Valver something like that."
1815.0,1816.0, Exactly.
1816.0,1818.0," But, you know, not to knock in the game."
1818.0,1819.0, I wanted to be great too.
1819.0,1821.0," Like I just bought a thing today and I want something, a damn-"
1821.0,1823.0, I want something good for it.
1823.0,1830.0," But, but looking at what was shown there, it's easy to see how in that, in that kind of environment, you look at CG and just say,"
1830.0,1835.0, all these things are happening explosions and helicopters are coming in.
1835.0,1837.0," You know, garnet from one of yours was just really odd."
1837.0,1841.0," He was going off on just the, basically what was the scripted stuff."
1841.0,1850.0," And it was interesting for me because now I think now more into after the crisis demo, I'm more into just like letting stuff happen and seeing what I can make happen."
1850.0,1855.0," And knowing that you know when I replay those levels, they will be in COD, they will be largely the same."
1855.0,1860.0," That at this point, I'll be able to, like, if I had friends over, then I'm essentially running a demo."
1860.0,1863.0, I know where to turn my camera so that they know and miss is the-
1864.0,1870.0," Should we go back? Should we go over some of it? We kind of breeze past it, but should we go over some of the stuff that we, like, because you and I both played crisis, you could go ahead."
1870.0,1871.0," Did you guys hit it, too?"
1871.0,1872.0," Yeah, I saw crisis."
1872.0,1874.0," I saw, did not play, didn't play."
1874.0,1876.0," I mean, I looked fantastic."
1876.0,1878.0," I mean, I didn't play it nearly as long as Sean did."
1878.0,1886.0," I mean, I only was there for like a good 20 minutes half an hour, but like, I was just exploring the world and just, like, you met a detail on stuff that I thought was just really amazing was."
1886.0,1889.0," So like, I was mailing some guy choking him with one hand."
1889.0,1901.0," And as you see, like, as I'm choking the life out of him, and his eyes rolled back in his head, his eyelids closed and I throw him out of my hand. He just kind of, like, flops over and threw a wall and try to, like, chain stuff and like knock him off other people."
1901.0,1910.0," It was just, I, I played it like three different ways trying a whole bunch of different things and I'm, Sean, I know that you, you were trying some really crazy stuff."
1910.0,1918.0," I hit it up, like, well, I had an appointment in Barker hangers, so I played it for about a half an hour and then I went back when I had some time on Thursday."
1918.0,1933.0," They played it two more extended sessions. Eventually it was cool. The guy there from, uh, Craig, I always confused the name from, cry tech was like, Kate just keep playing and it was kind of, it was funny because I was all like this little ego boosted like you're making it look really good."
1933.0,1945.0," So I was like, and I thought, and then I later told Brian, I'm like, man, look, we told me he's like, maybe like the biggest door. He's like, yeah, man, got what it takes to be a game-demonstrator."
1945.0,1958.0," But, uh, because I just played it and played it in much. And yeah, I mean, it reminds me of when, um, when Metal Gear Solid II came out, uh, it first they released a demo with it with the game zone of the enders."
1958.0,1970.0," And if you remember at the time, a lot of us got it, just played it again and again, even though it was this little demo, one because it was stated the yard and indicated what sort of power your PS2 had in it."
1970.0,1979.0," And so that was mesmerizing. But the gameplay itself, it was loaded with these deraix even in this little, uh, even in a little demo scratch of that game."
1979.0,1990.0," There were stuff to look for. And then there also, like let's push the limits and see what I can get away with. Let's see what the game developers anticipated me doing and how will they reward me for doing it?"
1990.0,1999.0," So I had the same feeling the whole time I was there. I just wanted to just didn't play that all day and take it home and even though it was just this one level because there was so much variability,"
1999.0,2014.0," so many options. And consistently, uh, just a great deal of reward for that kind of thinking, you know, everything from just, you know, the, the, like I said, the sharks out in the water and ways to, ways to engage the level."
2014.0,2022.0," And I said this, you know, I'll, I'll caught it off here because I like this is something else I talked about on another show, but you know, for me,"
2022.0,2033.0," single player of really engaging single player, you know, campaign that I want to see is going to give me the feel that I have when I play a multiple, great multiplayer game where, you know, I'm playing battlefield."
2033.0,2046.0," Some of the most entertaining moments are when you just have this hair brain idea and you say, you know what, I'm just going to do this and if it doesn't work and whatever it doesn't work, I just start to spawn again and equivalent here or you just load again, just hit your quick load key."
2046.0,2054.0," And knowing that this isn't going to be, this isn't experience that I can largely construct for myself, the enemies are going to surprise me and do things."
2054.0,2075.0," And if skin really close to that, you know, I mean, not, I mean, some of it's literal where you're using vehicles and jumping in and out switching the gun positions on them, you know, trying if, if at first you fail in one direction, you can take another route say, hey, all the planners are over at the TV station screw them. I'm going to go try to take the alleyway or something, maybe there's just one guy back there."
2075.0,2088.0," Really getting close to that and it's definitely appreciating. I hope if they can get it to run well and they make sure that the AI works properly throughout the game. I mean, I'm seeing some serious serious potential."
2088.0,2103.0," You know, I, I, I noticed some of that behavior and opportunity and brothers and arms tells highway as well in terms of the stuff that I saw them out. I saw a couple of missions where"
2103.0,2114.0," I, Gearbox was really demonstrating that to solve whatever, whatever problem there was or whatever the goal was, there were, you know, multiple angles of entry there, right."
2114.0,2129.0," And that the AI was, would respond to that, you know, that it was not just non-linear, but truly open. I mean, all there was was the goal and whatever you came up with to get to there was totally your call."
2129.0,2138.0," And if they're getting to an extent, it's, it's a little more constructed in that like, you know how they're showing off the destructible environments. You have a zoo continuum, a more routine machine, a team."
2138.0,2149.0," Right. And it's clearly, you know, parts of the environment are coded to explode. And when you put your crosshairs to order to issue a bazooka fire command on something, it will either appear or it won't appear."
2149.0,2158.0," You don't have the problem of saying, well, why when I hit the church tower, does it blow up, but why when I hit this like shitty little shack, does it not phase it?"
2158.0,2176.0," So it's kind of a neat way to prevent that, you know, to help you spend your disbelief, but yeah, that aside, I mean, I mean, they put you in the field, guys will come in and they'll take up positions and then from there. Yeah, just like you're saying, you can, however you decide to work around them, they will respond. They're not going to just sit there, you know, every time."
2176.0,2184.0," Like if you do flank them and if you don't have other guys suppressing them in that position, you'll lose that flank in our particular field. Yeah, they'll be okay. They're smart enough to say that."
2184.0,2191.0," Yeah, they jump behind this wall now and, you know, right. I mean, that's what I thought was cool. The whole suppression idea."
2191.0,2203.0," That's a good game. I can't wait for that to come out, especially after playing the Levanter airborne though it's not, I won't be the same playing it without the kernel there that they had as color commentator."
2203.0,2218.0," Yeah, who who provides color commentating. Why, why, why range is for epic was clowning on him. Yeah, I was there. I want to clown on that guy. It was face man. I know what he did. That's why it was so funny. Yeah, it got to this awkward pitch, because okay."
2218.0,2228.0," You know, they, they want to, they want to give you an element of just concern for the people that are involved in war, right, in this game."
2228.0,2243.0," One of the levels has to do with the guy who has a family, back at home, kind of like losing his stuff, not his little stuff literally, you know, losing his shit and running house to house deciding he's going to rescue civilians that happened to be caught in the crossfire."
2243.0,2257.0," And that jeopardizes the mission and your ability to directly fight the enemy. So as he's talking about this, John Colonel John and Tugas, you know, what did he say? We want, you know, we, we almost want want you to have, you know, the moment where"
2258.0,2263.0," I can't remember what he said. He didn't say wheat, but but something we want, we want an emotional roller coaster."
2263.0,2271.0," And so for immediately more, more grain is like an emotional roller coaster, John, he's like used to use those hands to choke the life out of men."
2271.0,2275.0, Like now you use the cover your eyes when you're crying at your own game.
2275.0,2277.0," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
2278.0,2281.0," This guy was like, you could tell it brought back the soldier in him."
2281.0,2291.0," Yeah, he's got like a name to defend. He just want to be the softy and it was awkward and then it led in to talk about like, oh, John never goes anywhere without a gun. He doesn't use his hands anymore because he uses a gun."
2291.0,2299.0," It was all like, and then, uh, then, uh, then, just kept lipping off and it eventually defused it because he's such a gestor that it was like, all right."
2300.0,2301.0, Don't know where to go from there.
2301.0,2305.0," But at home, the kernels got margarines like photo on the wall. Yeah."
2305.0,2307.0, With those. He's dead one day.
2307.0,2309.0," 50 calc, luck through it."
2309.0,2313.0, He's just so satellite photos and intel about their both.
2313.0,2315.0," They're both nice. Yeah, they're both really nice."
2315.0,2316.0, It was a good one.
2316.0,2318.0, It was a good one.
2318.0,2324.0," Yeah. So, uh, so I would say overall, it was, I hate to say it was a good chill for the PC."
2324.0,2326.0, But it actually was.
2326.0,2331.0, I think we should just keep talking about it.
2331.0,2333.0, Unless we're out of time or something.
2333.0,2334.0," Should take a break, though."
2334.0,2336.0, I don't want to take a break.
2336.0,2337.0, I don't want to take a break.
2337.0,2338.0, I don't want to podcast.
2338.0,2340.0, Now you don't want to take a break.
2340.0,2342.0, We got to take a break.
2342.0,2343.0, We have to take a break.
2343.0,2344.0, We have to take a break.
2344.0,2346.0," Man, dated, right, for our sponsors."
2346.0,2349.0, We'll be back after these good words from this night.
2349.0,2351.0," Right now, Ruto."
2351.0,2354.0, Ruto.
2355.0,2356.0," Hi, Ruto."
2356.0,2357.0, Hi.
2360.0,2364.0, This one podcast is brought to you by Doritos Unlock Xbox Contest.
2364.0,2372.0, Visit www.unlockxbox.com to turn your dream into the world's first user-generated Xbox video game.
2374.0,2375.0," Okay, so, okay, we're back."
2375.0,2378.0, Why are you singing Naruto before the break?
2378.0,2379.0, Are you into that shit?
2379.0,2382.0," Well, okay, we're talking about how we were assigned like all these, uh,"
2382.0,2384.0, pre-deus to write for the website.
2384.0,2386.0," Yeah. Well, I shared room with Chris Ben."
2386.0,2390.0," And, just as just habit, I have, I call it utterances."
2390.0,2394.0," And it's just saying, it's almost like a turret type scenario."
2394.0,2396.0, I was just never been diagnosed with that.
2396.0,2398.0," I mean, I can totally control it."
2398.0,2402.0," It's not that, but I just like to run off at the mouth and not use."
2402.0,2410.0," So he was, yeah, he, he, he, he, he, he got stuck with all the bellens of the show."
2410.0,2414.0," So he was writing about like, it hasn't he, like, a senior dude over the YouTube."
2414.0,2415.0, He's got a genius.
2415.0,2416.0, But he's a good sport.
2416.0,2418.0, And I think maybe that's where he got burned.
2418.0,2419.0, And it's fun.
2419.0,2423.0," We found that there was, it's probably more fun in some cases to write a preview for like,"
2423.0,2428.0," you know, carnival games for we, or, uh, you know, he did Naruto and a dry,"
2428.0,2430.0, another dragonball game.
2430.0,2432.0," And, uh, it got still unleashed."
2432.0,2436.0," It's like, when was Godzilla ever leashed, but, uh, so, as he was writing up,"
2436.0,2439.0," I was like, all right, I'm going to help you because the night before we had been"
2439.0,2443.0," up to like, like, three, 30 or whatever writing is like, like, let's just get these done."
2443.0,2447.0," And we'll, let's just throw jokes at one another and we'll turn them into a preview."
2447.0,2451.0," So, you know, the, the, the, the, with, um, with dragonball,"
2451.0,2454.0," I was like, this is going to come back to Naruto, trust me."
2454.0,2457.0," So it's dragonball is like, this is really like, you know,"
2457.0,2460.0, when Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was kind of like on it's like 15th season or something.
2460.0,2461.0, Yeah.
2461.0,2465.0, And all the kids that that made it successful in the first place got to the point where they had that
2465.0,2469.0," condom in their wall that stayed there until they graduated, and they're hoping to use, but never used."
2469.0,2471.0, So I told them all right that.
2471.0,2473.0," And he's like, I don't want to write that."
2473.0,2474.0, There's only going to be kids clicking on this.
2474.0,2477.0," So that got turned to like, you know, what kids working at RB's now."
2477.0,2482.0," But, um, so in the course of all this, the utterance to start to coming out and is like,"
2482.0,2486.0," what's the next one? Oh, so we're just, I was singing songs about Budokai and then Naruto."
2486.0,2491.0," And then we went through now, I forget any song that has kind of like a nana, nana section."
2492.0,2500.0," And just like we're doing it with Naruto. So hey, due to course was like one of the good ones. So we're just singing that at all all the time that we're trying to help them write it."
2500.0,2503.0, So sing and Sarah Naden and when there we go.
2503.0,2504.0, You were his head.
2504.0,2505.0, You were his muse.
2505.0,2507.0, You're ruined.
2507.0,2508.0," Hey, Jude for me."
2508.0,2512.0, And I'm the one who makes fun of that role in Ryan's Lord of the Rings online.
2512.0,2514.0, Maybe I should do it.
2514.0,2516.0, Right.
2516.0,2517.0," You know, you don't get it."
2518.0,2521.0," The bar, the character, you sing to the people to help them do something."
2521.0,2523.0, Don't play that guy anymore.
2523.0,2525.0, You play it while you're young.
2525.0,2526.0, He's up. He's all up and well.
2526.0,2528.0, Right on the well.
2528.0,2529.0," So let's, Sean."
2529.0,2532.0," Hi, what really got you excited."
2532.0,2535.0," What were you? What were you happy to see and please, we're not being excited."
2535.0,2537.0, That's a fine question.
2537.0,2541.0," I think we covered the ones that really did like Bioshok and, uh, all out."
2541.0,2543.0, Or not just other musings.
2543.0,2546.0," We both saw, uh, Conan and then it's the Conan."
2546.0,2548.0," That did not get me excited, however."
2548.0,2553.0," Uh, it wasn't the, uh, what, what did we call that when the titties appear?"
2553.0,2555.0," Oh, whoa, whoa."
2555.0,2556.0, Okay.
2556.0,2557.0, Katie's in Conan.
2557.0,2558.0, Re-wanted.
2558.0,2559.0, Yeah.
2559.0,2561.0," But it's like one of the, um, the buffs."
2561.0,2562.0," It will, it will."
2562.0,2563.0, It will.
2563.0,2564.0, It will.
2564.0,2565.0, There's a in-buff.
2565.0,2569.0," It will summon basically just the disembodied, just gorgeous disembodied breast,"
2569.0,2572.0, but with like a cobre hand or something.
2572.0,2573.0, Yeah.
2573.0,2575.0, It's like a semi-egyptian breast appeared in the air.
2575.0,2578.0," No, I think it was just like a priest casting, you know,"
2578.0,2581.0, sort of word forward to two or something that would increase your stamina.
2581.0,2583.0," But the grass or the grass, the ball is your right amount of."
2583.0,2585.0," Yeah, like, I'm trying to do it."
2585.0,2587.0," It was like, okay, make titty like, you know, three."
2587.0,2588.0, We're losing it.
2588.0,2591.0," I didn't know what it was doing, but I knew he was, and that's what it was."
2591.0,2593.0," Yeah, it was keep the game journalists awake."
2593.0,2595.0, Not even a part of the game.
2595.0,2596.0," Look, guys, kids."
2596.0,2598.0," But every time it happened, I was like, uh,"
2598.0,2599.0," you know, there was a,"
2599.0,2601.0," that whole thing was kind of one of those awkward,"
2601.0,2604.0," awkward scenarios where,"
2604.0,2609.0," I mean, not because I feel awkward when I see a pair of floating tits in a snakehead"
2609.0,2612.0," on them, but like, because when we do doesn't see those,"
2612.0,2614.0, I don't need a game for that.
2614.0,2615.0, I call it two days.
2615.0,2617.0, But first we walk into the booth.
2617.0,2622.0," There's one, it was basically a bunch of guys, and there's one infamous,"
2622.0,2623.0," uh, dude."
2623.0,2626.0," And little Alice is with us, you know,"
2626.0,2628.0," recent, um, to join one up."
2628.0,2629.0, Don't turn it one up.
2629.0,2630.0, It's the only woman in there with us.
2630.0,2633.0," And immediately, this guy makes the sausage party joke, which is like,"
2633.0,2635.0," okay, we're just waiting for it."
2635.0,2637.0," But then he goes, I got dives or something."
2637.0,2639.0, And he puts his arm around Alice.
2639.0,2641.0," It's like, it's going on."
2641.0,2644.0," You know, like, this is, and then so then they show us, like,"
2644.0,2647.0," you know, just go in and just get in all ripped and buffed out"
2647.0,2649.0, and chop and heads off fools and shit.
2649.0,2653.0," And then like a CG hot hot ass babe running by the side, you know,"
2653.0,2654.0," and then after that,"
2654.0,2657.0," you walk through the door and then they had some really attractive,"
2657.0,2660.0," you know, real women dressed up in, in Conan,"
2660.0,2663.0, when she uniform was welcome us into the demonstration room.
2663.0,2665.0," And, uh, and then all of a sudden,"
2665.0,2667.0, next thing it was the Tady Make button.
2667.0,2669.0," And so it was just like, the whole thing."
2669.0,2672.0," And then Alice was like, can you make a female character"
2672.0,2674.0," and no one in the room knew the answer, dude?"
2674.0,2677.0," Haha, that was so bad."
2677.0,2679.0," It was like, oh, god."
2679.0,2680.0, Wow.
2680.0,2685.0, Yeah.
2685.0,2686.0, Yeah.
2686.0,2688.0, What about the game itself?
2688.0,2689.0, It's hard.
2689.0,2690.0," We were having this conversation before that,"
2690.0,2694.0, it's really hard to demo MMOs because if you don't know exactly what is going on
2694.0,2697.0," with each character's abilities, especially in this case,"
2697.0,2699.0, because they were having terrible lag problems.
2699.0,2700.0, Yeah.
2700.0,2702.0," It just looks like the hotter tire hotels,"
2702.0,2704.0, it just looks like complete nonsense.
2704.0,2705.0, You can't tell what's going on.
2705.0,2706.0," I mean, because, you know,"
2706.0,2708.0," you know, I'm a mosaic, you have some with a sword,"
2708.0,2709.0, swinging at the air.
2709.0,2710.0, Yeah.
2710.0,2711.0, Yeah.
2711.0,2712.0, Of course to get to the air.
2712.0,2713.0, Basically facing in the right direction.
2713.0,2714.0, Yeah.
2714.0,2716.0, And like that happens in World of Warcraft.
2716.0,2717.0, It happens in EverQuest.
2717.0,2720.0," And they're trying to explain to us how, you know,"
2720.0,2725.0," how innovative the combat system is because you can sweep to the left or sweep,"
2725.0,2726.0," you know,"
2726.0,2728.0, upper right to the lower left or whatever.
2728.0,2729.0, It's been there.
2729.0,2730.0," It's a tech even stuff, right?"
2730.0,2731.0, Yeah.
2731.0,2733.0, Like they're saying there's more like fighting game moves.
2733.0,2735.0," He's kind of, that may be not that way."
2735.0,2737.0," But when you watch it though,"
2737.0,2738.0, it just looks like chaos.
2738.0,2739.0, It's a good sense of the sense.
2739.0,2740.0, Bad choreography.
2740.0,2745.0," You know, where one guy kind of hunches over in front of you and you just swing your arm around"
2745.0,2747.0, and then you just stands there.
2747.0,2748.0," See, that was the problem."
2748.0,2752.0," They showed us this high quality CG work where, you know,"
2752.0,2755.0," Conan is just locking off limbs and single sword strokes, right?"
2755.0,2758.0," But then they show us this demonstration and there's like I said,"
2758.0,2762.0, there's guys just kind of hunched over as Conan is just wailing on him.
2762.0,2764.0, Like he's trying to tenderize goddamn stage.
2764.0,2765.0," You know, they let him on."
2765.0,2766.0, Right.
2766.0,2767.0, And there's no sense of the tap attack.
2767.0,2768.0, There's not a tap attack.
2768.0,2770.0, There's not a tap attack.
2770.0,2773.0," So, but I don't know, you know, so much of that experience."
2773.0,2776.0, So much of the MMX experience is social.
2776.0,2779.0," You know, when you're talking, when you think about your best while moments,"
2779.0,2783.0," it's half of it's going to be supplied by players, right?"
2783.0,2784.0, Yes.
2784.0,2787.0, Sean said something and you responded and then he made his character do this.
2787.0,2790.0," But then when you're just watching MMO combat, you know,"
2790.0,2793.0," I mean, you're really missing the big picture and then when in the next,"
2793.0,2797.0, there's a demonstration of a game like Heavenly Sword or something where the entire
2797.0,2801.0," basically, you know, game processing budget and memory for, you know,"
2801.0,2804.0," for animations, for attacks and stuff like that."
2804.0,2805.0, Right.
2805.0,2809.0," Certainly the combat usually ends up being one of the least exciting things to watch,"
2809.0,2810.0, especially as a non-player.
2810.0,2814.0," I mean, you get into it and you accept it once you are playing that MMO."
2814.0,2818.0, But to be showing it off to someone as to why you should play the game.
2818.0,2822.0," I mean, if that's how you approached while, you wouldn't want to play while."
2822.0,2827.0," No, I mean, if you were to tell us, so he hits me and then I wait and then I hit him."
2827.0,2832.0," Even when you have the 20 skills that you eventually get or whatever and you are switching between him,"
2832.0,2833.0, you can't.
2833.0,2834.0," Well, it's sort of like, and he's right."
2834.0,2837.0," It's like one Sean, when you get behind us and you're making fun of us,"
2837.0,2840.0, because we're just like clicking random buttons and then it hits.
2840.0,2843.0," I mean, yeah, from that perspective, that is how it looks."
2843.0,2845.0," But in fact, there is a lot more going on in the game."
2845.0,2847.0," You're by, you're doing the math."
2847.0,2850.0," When exactly minus 19 appears over the head, you're imagining,"
2850.0,2852.0," yeah, I just heard that guy."
2852.0,2857.0," Well, and not just was not, but not just numbers, but also I'm going to stun him and then I'm going to do this."
2857.0,2859.0," I mean, there's some strategy involved."
2859.0,2864.0," If you can't convey, you know the character, you know as weaknesses, you're like playing him for 70 levels."
2864.0,2866.0," You know, yeah, you know what it was or the type of enemy."
2866.0,2870.0, You remember what it was like when you first encountered him and he beat the shit out of you and it pissed you off.
2870.0,2876.0, And then you finally figured out like that some excellent combination of the tax and coordination with allies would work against him.
2876.0,2879.0," Right, you need the kind of character to do this kind of damage."
2879.0,2883.0," Because he's weak to the sort of thing. I mean, it's, you know, there is a game there."
2883.0,2886.0," But if you're, but to demo it would be really hard, I think."
2886.0,2891.0," You know, I think you'd run a focus focus more on like the world itself or."
2891.0,2895.0," Yeah, and when you try, like you said, you have no attachment to the character you're playing."
2895.0,2902.0," I think the bottom line is we agree that it's, we don't end you when you're demonstrating an MMO in an environment like that."
2902.0,2908.0," However, I did get a great demo of, I, as one of the, I think probably the game that most surprised me the show,"
2908.0,2912.0, especially because Ryan's been talking about it for a long time and I tend not to trust him.
2912.0,2916.0," I told you guys, it was a pirate said the burning sea."
2916.0,2922.0," They gave a great demo for that game. They really did. I was, I was, I was pretty convinced by the end of it."
2922.0,2931.0," It was just very, you know, and it's not just because of the pirate scene, because that could just be a novelty, you know,"
2931.0,2935.0," the pirate scene, the pirate scene, but it's been on in the pirate scene."
2935.0,2943.0," But the, the gameplay mechanics is a described in the detail, you know, these guys really are trying hard to do some different stuff there."
2943.0,2945.0, Which is big.
2945.0,2947.0, What all did you see?
2947.0,2951.0," Well, they showed the four different factions, which are, which are interesting."
2951.0,2957.0," Pirates, French, Spanish, and English."
2957.0,2958.0," English, thank you."
2958.0,2959.0, No Dutch.
2959.0,2961.0, Yeah.
2961.0,2968.0," And they made the inevitable, you know, I asked, well, so, you know, what's going to be the incentive to not be a pirate?"
2968.0,2970.0," I mean, everyone's going to want to be a pirate."
2970.0,2973.0, Who wants to go into an MMO and then be French?
2973.0,2974.0," Called pirates, or..."
2974.0,2976.0," Called the, I'm called pirates or the burning sea."
2976.0,2978.0, Would you could be a French pirate?
2978.0,2980.0, You can't actually can be...
2980.0,2983.0," I'm sure the pirates are, composed of all national pirates."
2983.0,2985.0, The pirates can only be pirates.
2985.0,2986.0, No.
2986.0,2987.0, That's where it's supposed to go in the pirate.
2987.0,2990.0," Yeah, you're like a pirate, too."
2990.0,2995.0," The nation's, the national ones get other different class types."
2995.0,2996.0, They're not pirates.
2996.0,2997.0, They're not pirates.
2997.0,2999.0, Everybody's going to be a pirate.
2999.0,3000.0, Right.
3000.0,3001.0, And they're aware of that.
3001.0,3006.0," I mean, they're, well, they're going to try to incentivize you to be Spanish or French."
3006.0,3009.0," You'll get special abilities as a, as a Spaniard."
3009.0,3011.0, I don't know what those are.
3011.0,3014.0," So, you'll get special abilities as a pirate, too, right?"
3014.0,3016.0, I guess you will.
3016.0,3018.0, I'm not selling me on this man.
3018.0,3019.0, I am not selling me on this man.
3019.0,3022.0," So far, I know it's like it'd be a Spaniard."
3022.0,3023.0, A pirate.
3023.0,3025.0, Why do you don't want to play a game like that?
3025.0,3026.0, I can be French.
3026.0,3027.0, You can do your games.
3027.0,3029.0, Let me choose between that.
3029.0,3031.0," You get a, you get a uniform."
3031.0,3032.0, Very French.
3032.0,3033.0, You get a French uniform.
3033.0,3035.0," Is that, is that too, for you yet?"
3035.0,3036.0, Do I have you sold yet?
3036.0,3038.0," That's not all, Sean."
3038.0,3040.0, Do I want to play a game?
3040.0,3043.0," Sure, they show you like the ship combat."
3043.0,3044.0, They show the ship combat.
3044.0,3045.0," Okay, so that's it."
3045.0,3053.0," You know, a good percentage of the game takes place roaming around the land and doing, I think, sort of regular kind of quest."
3053.0,3063.0," But a good part of the game takes place on the open sea, where you're involved in ship combat with other players, both players and, I guess, NPC ships as well."
3063.0,3073.0," And the ship combat look pretty sophisticated for a game of this nature where, where facing matter, you know, there's all sorts of things your ship is,"
3073.0,3074.0," you know, you can't get up great bowls."
3074.0,3075.0, It goes along.
3075.0,3077.0," You know, you get better ships as you go along."
3077.0,3080.0, Can you make a pair of breasts appear above your ship?
3080.0,3083.0," You can go, but you can probably put a pair of breasts on your sales."
3083.0,3084.0, That's really custom wise.
3084.0,3085.0, Custom wise.
3085.0,3086.0, Custom wise.
3086.0,3087.0, You can.
3087.0,3088.0, I think that's something.
3088.0,3090.0," Well, they're going to filter it, of course, you know."
3090.0,3096.0," That's a good, that's a good, that's a good, you have a part, but that's a good transition into the, the whole, like,"
3096.0,3101.0," UT3 and content created on, you see, we're going on the PS3."
3101.0,3102.0, We can go into that.
3102.0,3103.0," Let me, I'll just do a bit of this."
3103.0,3108.0," Let's not, you know, don't cards, but just, but the whole, like, you know, TD on the top sales is kind of like,"
3108.0,3112.0," it's kind of, it's, it's kind of, it's so subbed off the game by the way."
3112.0,3113.0, That was a game of show.
3113.0,3117.0," Well, see, let's, let's say, announced like, that would be a good, it was like, I won't see the publisher"
3117.0,3119.0, something TD on the top sale.
3119.0,3120.0, Yeah.
3120.0,3126.0," But if I can try different Russia, but as soon as you start talking about, let's content,"
3126.0,3128.0," create it on PC, go over to consoles."
3128.0,3130.0, This is something that would happen.
3130.0,3135.0," It might potentially happen with gears of war, but the difference being that Microsoft and Epic would"
3135.0,3139.0, oversee specifically what content is passing through that tunnel filter.
3139.0,3143.0," Not so much on PS3 and it's like, as soon as you let people make whatever they want on their"
3143.0,3148.0," cars and forza, you got like the hateful mobile, like all kinds of bullshit, you know?"
3148.0,3151.0," So it's like, what, I mean, how, like, you could do anything."
3151.0,3155.0," If you're letting people create a map for your game, yeah, you can just have like the goatsy"
3155.0,3158.0," trophy room and all kinds of stuff, you know, you just like flick a switch and it's"
3158.0,3161.0, thought about harrow-quen babies in the most like rotten filthy.
3161.0,3163.0, That's a tab at humanity.
3163.0,3165.0, Everybody goes to the worst place at me.
3165.0,3167.0, It's tough to a girl.
3167.0,3168.0, Manly sucks.
3168.0,3169.0, It will happen though.
3169.0,3171.0," I mean, I think on PC, people got used to it."
3171.0,3175.0," Like, at first, it was a crazy thing with a spray tags and source for like, yeah, sure."
3175.0,3177.0," Oh, God, get these some great stuff with this."
3177.0,3179.0, And then kind of just died out.
3179.0,3183.0," Now it's like, you'll see it, but only now and then it's not the obsession because I think"
3183.0,3187.0," that the time, like even for me, the time we figured it out, like all my friends together"
3187.0,3191.0," and we took a huge image, chopped it up in a multiple pieces so that we can"
3191.0,3196.0, recombine the collage in team fortress and basically like cover the entire world with like
3196.0,3199.0," the most of not just filled possible, but we all had to go into a certain place."
3199.0,3203.0," You know, like when you get great people, state cards and a stadium and have them share"
3203.0,3207.0," stuff, you know, we know that like, okay, you know, your top centers spray your top"
3207.0,3208.0, left.
3208.0,3211.0," So each individual tag was not offensive, but when you put it together, it was a puzzle."
3211.0,3215.0," Yeah, that it made, it became had to combine our portal to enhance the fill."
3215.0,3217.0, That's very smart.
3217.0,3221.0," Well, I'm sure that whatever filters they try to put on in parts of the burning sea,"
3221.0,3225.0," no matter how clever they are, someone's still going to have the fine penis on it."
3225.0,3227.0," Yeah, that's what will happen."
3227.0,3228.0, The jelly Roger.
3228.0,3229.0, Right.
3229.0,3233.0," It's like all the naming filters and wow, they're still, you know, even in my own guilt, every other"
3233.0,3239.0," characters cocaine, mass murder, you know, penis filled with a one or whatever."
3239.0,3240.0, Right.
3240.0,3242.0," And there's people policing that, but they can't stop it."
3242.0,3243.0, I don't do it.
3243.0,3249.0," Oh, if it was Xbox live game, all the top sales would have all the main sales would just be like,"
3249.0,3257.0," uh, mountain deals it, no like, um, fight club posters and, yeah, you know, the usual range"
3257.0,3258.0, winner.
3258.0,3261.0," Yeah, Darren Darren, that was actually a good call though, too."
3261.0,3263.0, They could just sell those sales.
3263.0,3265.0," Oh, I'm writing the Pepsi."
3265.0,3268.0, You was just choosing to come from an upcoming move.
3268.0,3269.0," Yeah, right."
3269.0,3270.0, That's good.
3270.0,3271.0, It's not hard for enemies.
3271.0,3272.0, The boat.
3272.0,3276.0, I want to feel a buff on my full point thing here.
3276.0,3279.0, Is that just a kidnapping transformer?
3279.0,3281.0," So Jesus, the transvest name."
3281.0,3282.0, The transformers boat.
3282.0,3283.0, She a love buff.
3283.0,3284.0, That's good.
3284.0,3285.0, The beef.
3285.0,3286.0, Yes.
3286.0,3289.0," So, so the ship combat look good."
3289.0,3290.0, There's this whole med game going on.
3290.0,3292.0, I think that was one of the more interesting things.
3292.0,3293.0, That enough you felt the same way around.
3293.0,3296.0," But this whole control of ports throughout the, uh,"
3296.0,3302.0," Caribbean, where you're going to be fighting for, for, for different, uh,"
3302.0,3304.0, trading rights.
3304.0,3308.0," Domination over a port, which will give you, you're right, trading rights."
3308.0,3313.0, It will give you access to more resources for all the players on that particular nation.
3313.0,3316.0," And, and the, the bigger med game going on is that, you know,"
3316.0,3321.0," that, you're basically vying for control of the entire world map."
3321.0,3324.0," And at some point though, you know,"
3324.0,3328.0," we'll get down to a big epic battle in which one,"
3328.0,3333.0," one of the four factions is going to control the entire, uh, map."
3333.0,3334.0, Basically be declared winner.
3334.0,3335.0, What happened?
3335.0,3337.0," Well, then they hit the magic reset button."
3337.0,3341.0," So what happens in like any realm versus realm combat kind of scenarios,"
3341.0,3344.0," as you say, there's one side where everyone flocks you."
3344.0,3345.0, Yes.
3345.0,3346.0, And I asked them about that.
3346.0,3352.0," And they have a whole handicapping system set up where that could happen for a little while,"
3352.0,3355.0," but over time, you know, the, you know,"
3355.0,3360.0," if one, if one particular faction in one particular particular server"
3360.0,3363.0," is just completely dominating,"
3363.0,3368.0, the handicapping system will be a such that eventually they cannot keep controlling it.
3368.0,3371.0, They'll be penalized enough with points.
3371.0,3375.0, So the other teams will get enough advantage with other points that they'll get that taken away.
3375.0,3376.0, Okay.
3376.0,3379.0," Because there's an MMOI side NC soft called Aeon,"
3379.0,3380.0," which is like a,"
3380.0,3381.0," a,"
3381.0,3382.0, a Korean MMO.
3382.0,3385.0, A E O N A I O N.
3385.0,3386.0, A I O N.
3386.0,3388.0, And it has realm versus realm.
3388.0,3391.0," There's like the people, the demons above versus the angels below or something."
3391.0,3392.0, Something like that.
3392.0,3393.0," And, uh,"
3393.0,3396.0," if one side gets lopsided, you fight over the abyss in the middle."
3396.0,3402.0," There's these, this third NPC faction that will fight the people who are more strong and kind of try to balance it out."
3402.0,3405.0, So it seems like common thing.
3405.0,3406.0, Yeah.
3406.0,3407.0, That like that.
3407.0,3408.0," I know I have a,"
3408.0,3410.0, You're just making sure that's true.
3410.0,3411.0," You're just like,"
3411.0,3413.0," Yeah, give it a muppody."
3413.0,3414.0," Yeah, sure."
3414.0,3415.0, Sorry muppody.
3415.0,3417.0," Most of the boarding party combat too, the kind of cool."
3417.0,3418.0," Oh yeah, you can board chips."
3418.0,3421.0, You can either sync them outright or you can board them.
3421.0,3424.0," If you board them, you'll get fatter loot if they're booted."
3424.0,3427.0," But there's a chance that you will,"
3427.0,3428.0," uh,"
3428.0,3430.0, they get take back the ship that you won't succeed.
3430.0,3431.0," Making with the swash buckle,"
3431.0,3432.0, right.
3432.0,3433.0," If you, if you sync the ship,"
3433.0,3435.0, you'll get less good loot.
3435.0,3438.0," In fact, they were at that some point in the game's development."
3438.0,3439.0," When you sync the ship,"
3439.0,3443.0, you actually got no loot because the loot sank to the bottom of the ocean.
3443.0,3444.0," But then they realize,"
3444.0,3446.0, so what's the incentive?
3446.0,3448.0," Is this all entirely, uh,"
3448.0,3449.0," like,"
3449.0,3450.0, does it die rolling stuff?
3450.0,3451.0," I mean,"
3451.0,3453.0," is it like physics based cannon fire or is it,"
3453.0,3455.0," you just click on their ship and then,"
3455.0,3456.0," you know, it rolls a die."
3456.0,3457.0, It's a different fire.
3457.0,3460.0," There is, there's firing arcs and it's like the wind."
3460.0,3463.0," It plays did play a piece in it, right?"
3463.0,3465.0," You know, that would definitely affect your,"
3465.0,3466.0," your,"
3466.0,3467.0, to hit ability.
3467.0,3470.0," Well, is it, is it actually pushing the cannonball or is it just like a,"
3470.0,3472.0," or is it just, like, a resistance modifier like in,"
3472.0,3474.0, while or something the wind?
3474.0,3475.0," Yeah, that I'm not sure."
3475.0,3477.0," But I would say a hot sail would be just a big,"
3477.0,3479.0," like giant set of ass cheeks because like,"
3479.0,3480.0," like,"
3480.0,3481.0," with the wind blowing behind it,"
3481.0,3482.0," it would be like,"
3482.0,3483.0," uh,"
3483.0,3485.0," I think with MMO's restole to the point where that's,"
3485.0,3486.0, that's that rolls.
3486.0,3487.0, Yeah.
3487.0,3488.0," So, uh,"
3488.0,3489.0, okay.
3489.0,3491.0," So obviously, I don't have a career ahead of me."
3492.0,3495.0," And pitching, pitching games on the internet."
3495.0,3496.0," But in a reductionous way,"
3496.0,3498.0," though, would you say it would be fair to say it's only,"
3498.0,3499.0," like,"
3499.0,3500.0," sit my eyes pirates,"
3500.0,3501.0," but expand it into MMO form,"
3501.0,3504.0," or is that just, or is that too basic?"
3504.0,3505.0," No,"
3505.0,3507.0," that's because,"
3507.0,3508.0," sit, because Pirates had,"
3508.0,3510.0, I think more dimensions than this.
3510.0,3512.0," I mean, this is probably more like,"
3512.0,3514.0," standard MMO translated into,"
3514.0,3516.0, into this kind of world.
3516.0,3518.0," The ship combat was kind of,"
3518.0,3520.0, kind of similar.
3520.0,3521.0," I mean, not."
3521.0,3522.0, To Pirates.
3522.0,3523.0," Sort of,"
3523.0,3524.0," Yeah, it's kind of similar in the Pirates."
3524.0,3525.0, You're right.
3525.0,3526.0," Yeah, the ship,"
3526.0,3528.0, but there's no bar room dancing in this game.
3528.0,3529.0," Oh, damn it."
3529.0,3530.0," It's in my,"
3530.0,3531.0, it's pirates.
3531.0,3532.0, No stealth sequences.
3532.0,3534.0," Yeah, not that I saw."
3534.0,3535.0," Yeah, that's good, actually."
3535.0,3537.0," This is in our friends at one C,"
3537.0,3538.0," which is,"
3538.0,3539.0," I got the,"
3539.0,3541.0, their catalog in front of me right now.
3541.0,3542.0," Yes, sir."
3542.0,3543.0, It's actually worth reading from.
3543.0,3544.0," This is,"
3544.0,3545.0," this is,"
3545.0,3546.0," you know,"
3546.0,3547.0," in a way when you see it,"
3547.0,3548.0," it's so dumb,"
3548.0,3549.0," but I've said to myself,"
3549.0,3551.0," it's the boat ride of video games,"
3551.0,3552.0," just because like,"
3552.0,3554.0," I got the manual and I saw,"
3554.0,3555.0," you know,"
3555.0,3557.0," like now servicing,"
3557.0,3558.0," basically every,"
3558.0,3559.0," you know,"
3559.0,3560.0, one of the Central Asian stands.
3560.0,3561.0," So, you know,"
3561.0,3562.0," Uzbekistan Turkmenistan,"
3562.0,3563.0," Kurdistan,"
3563.0,3564.0," and I was like,"
3564.0,3565.0," okay, this is interesting."
3565.0,3566.0," And then, you know,"
3566.0,3567.0," you read the,"
3567.0,3569.0," you read the descriptions for like,"
3569.0,3570.0," like,"
3570.0,3571.0," Neck Grove is actually a cool,"
3571.0,3573.0, an interesting game has some of the guys that
3573.0,3574.0," made paint killer,"
3574.0,3575.0, which we liked here.
3575.0,3578.0, Which was fun and just goofy as hell.
3578.0,3579.0," And so this thing too,"
3579.0,3581.0," you're looking at it's basically world war one,"
3581.0,3582.0," and all of a sudden,"
3582.0,3586.0," demons and vampires and all sorts of randomness,"
3586.0,3587.0," like, breakthrough and,"
3587.0,3589.0," with world war one,"
3589.0,3591.0," weaponry and then with demonic and vampiric weaponry,"
3591.0,3593.0, you're continuing to fight.
3593.0,3594.0," But so,"
3594.0,3595.0," I mean, you have to imagine,"
3595.0,3596.0," you know, like,"
3596.0,3597.0," whatever,"
3597.0,3599.0, Baron Von Riktoff flies over and then suddenly a demon
3599.0,3602.0, is just tearing at the canvas of a split plane or something.
3602.0,3604.0, And I play that.
3604.0,3605.0, But it did look cool.
3605.0,3606.0," I know what's like,"
3606.0,3607.0," you know,"
3607.0,3609.0, this is a fun game.
3609.0,3610.0," It runs well,"
3610.0,3612.0, it's DX9 and stuff.
3612.0,3613.0," But in a weird way where,"
3613.0,3616.0, almost every game in this book in this brochure
3616.0,3620.0," is the most arbitrary collection of just,"
3620.0,3623.0, the weirdest genre stereotypes and just things
3623.0,3624.0," that's thrown in,"
3624.0,3625.0," but like,"
3625.0,3627.0, now and then they pull it off and it works.
3627.0,3628.0," It's like,"
3628.0,3629.0," that's,"
3629.0,3630.0," okay,"
3630.0,3631.0, that's basically pain killer.
3631.0,3632.0," It's like,"
3632.0,3633.0," that's just,"
3633.0,3634.0," that's just,"
3634.0,3635.0," yeah,"
3635.0,3636.0, it's too hard to describe.
3636.0,3637.0," And,"
3637.0,3638.0," so it's,"
3638.0,3640.0," this isn't quite here the web,"
3640.0,3641.0, but it's interesting.
3641.0,3642.0," I mean,"
3642.0,3643.0," this is,"
3643.0,3644.0," this is,"
3644.0,3645.0," I have a real hero for later,"
3645.0,3646.0," but this is just like,"
3646.0,3648.0," the game Necrovision is,"
3648.0,3649.0, the year is 1916.
3649.0,3652.0, Young American joined UK Army to experience adventure
3652.0,3655.0, of his life and soon realizes that greater evil
3655.0,3657.0, is hiding beneath the Great War storm.
3657.0,3659.0," He has to face the underground world of vampire,"
3659.0,3660.0," demon,"
3660.0,3661.0," evil genius creature,"
3661.0,3663.0, and even become one of the demon to rescue
3663.0,3665.0, the human vampire kind for forces of darkness.
3666.0,3668.0," Necrovision is a next gen,"
3668.0,3670.0, first person shooter taking place in variety of locations
3670.0,3672.0, from battlefield of World War I
3672.0,3675.0, to much darker and brutal underground world of vampires and demons.
3675.0,3678.0," Seenaries range from realistic to dreamlike,"
3678.0,3681.0," opponents from enemy troops to fantasy creatures,"
3681.0,3683.0, old fashioned looking style of the game
3683.0,3686.0, is going to remind the world setting from the Lovecraft Horse
3686.0,3689.0, and seamlessly mix the war shooting elements into it.
3689.0,3691.0," Player will fight enemies using environments,"
3691.0,3692.0," powerful and evil artifacts,"
3692.0,3693.0," vampire technology,"

3697.0,3699.0, Authentic vampire technology.
3699.0,3702.0, Old fashioned looking style of the game is going to remind the world setting
3702.0,3704.0, from Lovecraft Horse.
3704.0,3705.0, That was fantastic.
3705.0,3707.0," Man, it's so much someone ran through Babbles,"
3707.0,3708.0, I shouldn't have.
3708.0,3710.0," I'm glad that they came out though of,"
3710.0,3711.0," old mathematics of,"
3711.0,3713.0, I'll tell you didn't make it out though.
3713.0,3716.0," Just works by his own clock and I wanted to see,"
3716.0,3718.0," I was definitely looking to see,"
3718.0,3721.0, Storm and War Battle of Britain
3722.0,3723.0," is next flight to there,"
3723.0,3724.0, but we have to wait.
3724.0,3726.0," No, I'm sure it's going to be a,"
3726.0,3729.0, Germany next month for the big convention there.
3729.0,3730.0, All right.
3730.0,3732.0, When does that grow vision come in?
3732.0,3733.0, How do you remember?
3733.0,3734.0, I don't know.
3734.0,3735.0, I don't know.
3735.0,3736.0, It's soon for all that.
3736.0,3737.0," That's kind of,"
3737.0,3740.0, that was something interesting about the stocker prequel that was there too.
3740.0,3741.0," It's kind of,"
3741.0,3743.0," it just showed up and it was,"
3743.0,3744.0," you know, like when I spoke to him,"
3744.0,3747.0," it was just kind of like the product manager associated with,"
3747.0,3748.0, GSC game world.
3748.0,3749.0," They had no,"
3749.0,3751.0, publisher support there.
3751.0,3754.0," And that was interesting because you think that if stocker performed well,"
3754.0,3755.0," and,"
3755.0,3757.0," here we are back into the business thing,"
3757.0,3760.0," but I, but only, you know, in this specific context,"
3760.0,3761.0, it performed well.
3761.0,3762.0," You think the teach key would say,"
3762.0,3764.0," hey, this is a great game."
3764.0,3767.0, So the reason we well were behind it is a prequel.
3767.0,3769.0, It looks like they learned from their lessons.
3769.0,3773.0," It's got, I mean, they learned from their lesson from,"
3773.0,3776.0," the, the creating and releasing stocker,"
3776.0,3778.0, doesn't see shadow Chernobyl.
3778.0,3779.0," This is what, called,"
3779.0,3780.0, just start your clear sky.
3780.0,3781.0, It's starting to clear sky.
3781.0,3782.0, Yeah.
3782.0,3784.0," And, you know, it looks better."
3784.0,3786.0, It sounds like they're doing all kinds of fun stuff.
3786.0,3787.0," We think, but I'm just curious."
3787.0,3788.0," You know, who's someone going to pick it up?"
3788.0,3789.0, I hope they do.
3789.0,3790.0," Or is it just, I'll be downloadable."
3790.0,3791.0," Almost going to,"
3791.0,3792.0," I mean, they're just doing,"
3792.0,3793.0," it's not that it's not a full,"
3793.0,3795.0," a full, uh, prequel for this thing."
3795.0,3796.0, That's not an expansion.
3796.0,3797.0, Yeah.
3797.0,3798.0," It's a, it's a standalone."
3798.0,3799.0, It's a full full game.
3799.0,3801.0," It's going to, it's going to be optimized for DX10."
3801.0,3802.0," Which means,"
3802.0,3803.0," I mean,"
3803.0,3804.0," it's obviously going to look better,"
3804.0,3805.0," but I wonder if it's going to,"
3805.0,3808.0," if it's going to be a resource or the character models and everything,"
3808.0,3809.0," I suspect,"
3809.0,3811.0, it was running really smooth there.
3811.0,3813.0," Which was interesting, you know,"
3813.0,3814.0," and actually,"
3814.0,3815.0," you know, stocker I got,"
3815.0,3817.0," it's a run quite well for me, you know,"
3817.0,3818.0," um,"
3818.0,3819.0, it just took a while.
3819.0,3820.0, Yeah.
3820.0,3821.0," I took a lot of, it took a lot of,"
3821.0,3822.0," I think this would,"
3822.0,3823.0, setting some bit.
3823.0,3824.0, But you had those something else interesting.
3824.0,3826.0," Any of you guys, uh,"
3826.0,3827.0, try mercenaries too.
3827.0,3829.0, I tried a little bit of that.
3829.0,3830.0," I was, uh,"
3830.0,3831.0," I was, I was always,"
3831.0,3832.0," I was always fighting off a crouch and watch it,"
3832.0,3833.0, because there's a lot of people around that one.
3833.0,3834.0, Yeah.
3834.0,3835.0, It was popular.
3835.0,3836.0, It was pretty fun.
3836.0,3837.0, I've had it looked.
3837.0,3839.0," It kind of reminded me of, um,"
3839.0,3841.0, of Kane and Lynch in a way.
3841.0,3842.0," You know, like I was thinking,"
3842.0,3843.0," uh,"
3843.0,3844.0, what's the studio that's making that?
3844.0,3845.0," I, uh,"
3845.0,3846.0," wait, uh,"
3846.0,3847.0, I owe interactive files.
3847.0,3848.0, Yeah.
3848.0,3849.0," When they've done games and I also published them,"
3849.0,3850.0," like, uh,"
3850.0,3851.0, the hitman games.
3851.0,3852.0," They're always usually really good,"
3852.0,3853.0," but there's something,"
3853.0,3855.0," they just lack, uh,"
3855.0,3857.0, sort of the final coat of garnish on them.
3857.0,3858.0, Yeah.
3858.0,3859.0," And that's kind of how, and of course,"
3859.0,3861.0," this is because it was a demonstration of an unfinished game,"
3861.0,3862.0, and that could just be it.
3862.0,3864.0," But, um, mercenary's had that same vibe."
3864.0,3865.0, It looked completely fun.
3865.0,3867.0," It looks like it's going to be awesome to go in there and co-op,"
3867.0,3869.0," and just destroy everything,"
3869.0,3870.0," calling, you know,"
3870.0,3872.0," fuel air bombs and drop those places,"
3872.0,3874.0," getting a 10s and, you know,"
3874.0,3875.0, just alone.
3875.0,3877.0," Anytime you have a plane and something,"
3877.0,3878.0," and you allow multiple people in it,"
3878.0,3880.0," you basically created your own game within a great,"
3880.0,3881.0," and within a game,"
3881.0,3883.0, where you just do whatever you want.
3883.0,3884.0," See if you can play fall the leader,"
3884.0,3886.0, crazy bombing runs and stuff.
3886.0,3887.0," Um,"
3887.0,3888.0," visually though,"
3888.0,3891.0," it's remarkable in that it renders so much stuff in it,"
3891.0,3892.0," and it's such scale,"
3892.0,3894.0," but anytime you go up to anything,"
3894.0,3896.0, it kind of feels kind of chancy.
3896.0,3898.0," And then when you're just walking around shooting,"
3898.0,3901.0," I mean, once you go from firing rockets in a helicopter"
3901.0,3903.0," to running around on the street,"
3903.0,3904.0," and since it's third person,"
3904.0,3906.0," you know, you just have a little dot,"
3906.0,3907.0," and you wave it over people,"
3907.0,3909.0, and it's kind of like the PPP view.
3909.0,3910.0, Right.
3910.0,3912.0," Yeah, because the thing that you get with third person games,"
3912.0,3913.0," and times,"
3913.0,3914.0," the thing that exactly,"
3914.0,3915.0," here's a war over comms,"
3915.0,3918.0," and still uses that perspective by drawing you in close to it,"
3918.0,3920.0," by combining it with the ability to sight your own weapon,"
3920.0,3921.0, and stuff.
3921.0,3924.0," But it kind of has that toyish vibe to it when you're running around,"
3924.0,3926.0, and get away to get another helicopter.
3926.0,3927.0," But it definitely, yeah,"
3927.0,3929.0, it's got some potential.
3929.0,3930.0, I look forward to playing it.
3930.0,3932.0, So it's me doing this now.
3932.0,3933.0," Yeah, good call up game."
3933.0,3934.0, I like me some call up.
3934.0,3935.0, Hmm.
3935.0,3937.0, All right.
3937.0,3938.0, Try to work out.
3938.0,3939.0, How we do now?
3939.0,3940.0, You're just all the time.
3940.0,3941.0," You're just like,"
3941.0,3942.0, we're done.
3942.0,3943.0, So whatever.
3943.0,3945.0, I played a whole lot more shit.
3945.0,3946.0," Yeah, I'll say it."
3946.0,3947.0, There's a lot more shit.
3947.0,3948.0, There's a lot more shit.
3948.0,3949.0, There's a lot more shit.
3949.0,3951.0," Oh, we can't carry on."
3951.0,3952.0," All right, all right."
3952.0,3953.0, I'm a shit on this man.
3953.0,3954.0," Look, all right."
3954.0,3956.0," I just, just, what?"
3956.0,3957.0, Just because I was making that face.
3957.0,3959.0," No, for like 20 minutes, man."
3959.0,3961.0," I can't, I guess they're at the wall and talk to the wall,"
3961.0,3963.0, but it's someone listening.
3963.0,3965.0, I'm listening.
3965.0,3967.0," I can't, let's finish this shit up."
3967.0,3970.0, Let's talk to the guy who sent us from the Netherlands.
3970.0,3971.0, You sent us this.
3971.0,3972.0, All right.
3972.0,3973.0, You got us some letter.
3973.0,3975.0, I'll pretend that I was talking to him.
3975.0,3978.0," I, well, we just got this today."
3978.0,3979.0, So the timing was good.
3979.0,3980.0, We got a magazine.
3980.0,3982.0, I think they got the magazine over there for me.
3982.0,3983.0, Or is it here?
3983.0,3984.0," Yeah, you can read his letter."
3984.0,3986.0," I'm not talking to you right now, man."
3986.0,3989.0," I'm going to go, I don't know where his magazine is."
3989.0,3990.0," I'm breaking up on air here, but there it is."
3990.0,3993.0, PC gameplay from the Netherlands.
3993.0,3995.0," Oh, there's that the letter."
3995.0,3996.0, Do you know what?
3996.0,3997.0," Sean, you and I will just go by quick."
3997.0,3998.0, Where's the actual podcast?
3998.0,3999.0, I was going to stop.
3999.0,4000.0," Well, there's front lines."
4000.0,4001.0, He'll award.
4001.0,4002.0, There's an expansion for Microsoft.
4002.0,4004.0," Flight saying the, and everyone want the hit."
4004.0,4007.0, There's a way where they show in that.
4007.0,4008.0, That was over in the game.
4008.0,4010.0, It's for window section of Burger Hanger.
4010.0,4011.0, Maybe you should have stopped by it.
4011.0,4013.0, I didn't go to Burger Hanger.
4013.0,4016.0, All I heard was bad things about Barker hanger.
4016.0,4019.0," What about, that was for the best places to go."
4019.0,4021.0, Where do you get a certain people that want to go?
4021.0,4024.0, You can get a wide variety of games under one roof.
4024.0,4025.0, I can't play here.
4025.0,4028.0," I would be like, I'm going to walk over to Barker Hanger and people would be like,"
4028.0,4029.0," Oh, dude, don't do that."
4029.0,4031.0, Then you get on the shuttle because it's a 20 minute drive.
4031.0,4033.0," You know, you know, you're just telling the good."
4033.0,4035.0, That's what piss me off about E3 was it.
4036.0,4039.0, They had the shuttle going around to all the different hotels out there.
4039.0,4044.0," And except for Barker hanger, these hotels were like within four blocks of each other."
4044.0,4048.0," In Santa Monica, which is not only beautiful."
4048.0,4053.0," And sunny out, but also it's completely fucking flat."
4053.0,4054.0, It's level.
4054.0,4057.0, We're used to walking around here in San Francisco where there's big hills.
4057.0,4058.0, Yeah.
4058.0,4061.0, So there is no inclined whatsoever.
4061.0,4062.0, It's beautiful outside.
4062.0,4063.0, And they've got the shuttle going around.
4063.0,4065.0, And you got these fucking fat ass.
4065.0,4069.0," Sweating in their black t-shirts, like waiting for the shuttle."
4069.0,4071.0, I was standing behind these guys.
4071.0,4073.0, These fat dudes waiting for the shuttle.
4073.0,4075.0, And I admit I was waiting for the show.
4075.0,4076.0, I was feeling a little lazy.
4076.0,4078.0, But these guys are standing there.
4078.0,4080.0," And, you know, they come every 10 minutes."
4080.0,4081.0," And this one guy says to the other,"
4081.0,4084.0," I swear if this shuttle is coming in the next two minutes,"
4084.0,4085.0, I'm just not going to the demo.
4085.0,4086.0, Just fuck it.
4086.0,4090.0," If this is a movie, you're fucking ass and walk."
4090.0,4091.0, I know.
4091.0,4093.0, I was waiting in line for these shuttle's.
4093.0,4095.0," I was like, I swear."
4095.0,4096.0, I was waiting in line for one shuttle.
4096.0,4098.0, It's similar to a fat asses.
4098.0,4101.0, And I asked one of the officials there.
4101.0,4102.0, How far is the fair amount from here?
4102.0,4104.0, It's just a 10 minute walk.
4104.0,4105.0, Fuck it.
4105.0,4106.0, I'll just walk.
4106.0,4107.0, Yeah.
4107.0,4108.0," I mean, I walked everywhere."
4108.0,4109.0, It was no big deal.
4109.0,4110.0, The marker was the one place that you would.
4110.0,4111.0, Yeah.
4111.0,4112.0, I could see that.
4112.0,4113.0," But actually, I thought it was kind of like,"
4113.0,4114.0, for Barker.
4114.0,4116.0, It's not that it wouldn't if you walked that you would get lost.
4116.0,4117.0, Unless you were a local.
4117.0,4118.0, That was to Barker.
4118.0,4119.0, Yeah.
4119.0,4120.0," It was just, it was out on the near field."
4120.0,4121.0," Why did they have a,"
4121.0,4122.0," I mean, I had one."
4122.0,4123.0," I mean, I had one."
4123.0,4126.0," I know that we, we did this D3 for months leading up to the show."
4126.0,4128.0, But I actually enjoyed myself for the most part.
4128.0,4129.0," I didn't go to that hanger,"
4129.0,4132.0," but the one thing there is like, why isn't the time or place?"
4132.0,4134.0, I'm sure there is no answer.
4134.0,4135.0, Except maybe rent.
4135.0,4139.0, Why that the main convention thing was so far removed.
4139.0,4143.0, Pizzically from the convention wrapper or space.
4143.0,4146.0," That was the biggest, like, I think that's what they're talking about."
4146.0,4148.0, Vegas is a likely container for next year.
4149.0,4151.0," You can do the same thing, but everything is closer."
4151.0,4152.0, What did you guys think about?
4152.0,4157.0," I didn't go to the hanger, but I know it was done on the kind of all things being equal sort of thing where"
4157.0,4158.0, what?
4158.0,4162.0," Ryan's like, what were we going to talk about gold member, the Dutch guy there?"
4162.0,4163.0," Oh, yes."
4163.0,4164.0," No, right."
4164.0,4165.0," No, right."
4165.0,4166.0, Look at me because I said fuck Vegas.
4166.0,4167.0, Yeah.
4167.0,4168.0, Somebody bad memories.
4168.0,4169.0, I can't go to that town.
4169.0,4170.0," No, Marcus, me and trouble."
4170.0,4171.0, Really?
4171.0,4172.0, Yeah.
4172.0,4173.0, Never mind.
4173.0,4174.0," Does it get you in trouble too, Ryan?"
4174.0,4175.0," Hell, no."
4175.0,4176.0," Well, yeah."
4176.0,4177.0, Do you gamble?
4177.0,4178.0, Yeah.
4178.0,4179.0, Yeah.
4179.0,4180.0, He collects cards.
4180.0,4183.0, By gambling means dropping dollar bills and seeing what happens to him.
4183.0,4185.0, Pokemon gambling.
4185.0,4187.0, He's trading you geocards.
4187.0,4188.0, You get it.
4188.0,4193.0," Well, you know, on the street corner of the pimple luba's give you a, if you eat a little like flyer's for."
4193.0,4195.0, He trades those like Pokemon for.
4195.0,4196.0, That's what I say.
4196.0,4197.0, That's what I say.
4197.0,4198.0, That's what services.
4198.0,4201.0," They have that they have their little thing where it's like,"
4201.0,4202.0, when they stick it.
4202.0,4204.0," I choose you, blonde Russian girl."
4204.0,4206.0," You know, those gargotico and the alley ponds about that."
4207.0,4211.0, About how much money Los Angeles lost this year because of the E3 things.
4211.0,4212.0, Gale down so far.
4212.0,4219.0," And one of the, one of the little sub indices that hurt the most was all the women who"
4219.0,4221.0, normally would get hired out of spoof bids.
4221.0,4228.0," Turns out a lot of those women actually, you know, make a lot of a lot of money every E3 and that keeps them going for a while."
4228.0,4229.0, They're there that man.
4229.0,4230.0," Yeah, they're."
4230.0,4231.0, They're.
4231.0,4232.0," Yeah, think about it."
4232.0,4234.0," Actually, I thought you're going to say the people got hurt most of the guys who sell the bacon"
4234.0,4236.0, wrapped hot dogs on the street corners.
4236.0,4238.0, Probably a lot of those guys too.
4238.0,4239.0, Yeah.
4239.0,4241.0, So back to back to our.
4241.0,4242.0, We spark our anger.
4242.0,4245.0, We're talking about our leather leather leather from the Netherlands.
4245.0,4246.0," Oh, our letter from the Netherlands."
4246.0,4251.0," Yeah, we got a, we got a letter today from a young man by the name of,"
4251.0,4252.0, I'm sorry.
4252.0,4253.0, He was of the podcast.
4253.0,4254.0, I'm sorry.
4254.0,4255.0, I can't speak that.
4255.0,4256.0, So I can't.
4256.0,4257.0, I don't have to answer name.
4257.0,4258.0, It's Petri.
4258.0,4259.0, P.E.T.
4259.0,4260.0, R.I.T.
4260.0,4261.0, Petripe.
4261.0,4263.0, I'll just put on some random stuff.
4263.0,4265.0, I'm talking about better girl.
4265.0,4266.0, Excellent.
4266.0,4267.0, Petri.
4267.0,4269.0, Some people in built it speak Dutch.
4269.0,4271.0, So it relative close to France.
4271.0,4272.0, I stepped Petri.
4272.0,4273.0, Petri.
4273.0,4274.0, Petri.
4274.0,4275.0, Dahan.
4275.0,4276.0, H-A-A-N.
4276.0,4277.0, True.
4277.0,4279.0, He wrote us from the Hague in the Netherlands.
4279.0,4280.0, Goldlabber for short.
4280.0,4281.0, I'm going to read this letter.
4281.0,4282.0, But.
4282.0,4284.0, And it's in broken English.
4284.0,4286.0, I'm not doing this to make fun of him.
4286.0,4288.0, It's just this is what he wrote.
4288.0,4290.0," Okay, but since none of us could he write."
4290.0,4292.0," No, this is like huge props to."
4293.0,4296.0," Right, he actually was able to compose a letter that we can read."
4296.0,4298.0, And I couldn't compose three words in.
4298.0,4300.0, What do they speak there Dutch?
4300.0,4301.0, He's.
4301.0,4302.0, He's.
4302.0,4303.0," Uh, Jared, dude, I've gained."
4303.0,4306.0, You probably get like 10 of messengers every day.
4306.0,4308.0," Oh, he said 10 of messengers."
4308.0,4309.0, Just correct.
4309.0,4310.0, I'm reading your head.
4310.0,4311.0, He's reading it.
4311.0,4312.0, You probably get like 10's.
4312.0,4314.0, But I want to let you know.
4314.0,4317.0, I have something for the team and for the podcast that I think is really funny.
4317.0,4319.0, I used to play games and he was for.
4319.0,4320.0," Well, enough about me."
4320.0,4321.0, I want to tell you my big fan.
4321.0,4323.0, I have a big fan of GFW in the podcast.
4323.0,4327.0," Uh, because I'm from Europe, but I can't buy GFW magazine."
4327.0,4329.0," Well, what's up with that?"
4329.0,4331.0, I can't invite GFW in Europe.
4331.0,4332.0," Uh, sucks."
4332.0,4333.0," Mike, you need to get on that."
4333.0,4334.0, Hook him up with Zinho.
4334.0,4335.0, We accept euros.
4335.0,4336.0, Yeah.
4336.0,4337.0," Uh, but I do listen."
4337.0,4339.0, I listen to the podcast for nine months now.
4339.0,4341.0, And I think it's one of the best out there.
4341.0,4345.0, And I know this because I listen to about 12 gaming podcasts every week.
4345.0,4346.0, Holy.
4346.0,4349.0," Yeah, this is just man needs a little more to do with this."
4349.0,4350.0," Oh, yeah."
4350.0,4351.0, Okay.
4351.0,4352.0, Okay.
4352.0,4353.0, Okay.
4353.0,4354.0, Arise on average.
4354.0,4355.0, Really.
4355.0,4356.0," Oh, I want to have that treat."
4356.0,4358.0," If you're listening to me right now, turn it off."
4358.0,4359.0, Let's have six months of like darkness.
4359.0,4360.0, Go outside.
4360.0,4361.0, Something.
4361.0,4362.0, Hang in.
4362.0,4363.0, Go meet some girls.
4363.0,4364.0," Uh, last week."
4364.0,4367.0, I made a remix of what I thought was the best of the past.
4367.0,4368.0, Hopefully you can appreciate it.
4368.0,4370.0," The maybe you could put on the GFW podcast,"
4370.0,4372.0," Bogger, maybe even on the podcast itself."
4372.0,4374.0," You get your wish, dude."
4374.0,4376.0," And you get your wish because when we sign off today,"
4377.0,4382.0," everybody listening, you're going to be hearing a kind of a Dutch disco techno remix."
4382.0,4388.0, So that's why I do I kept saying gold member because it's totally gold membered out the song that you're got here.
4388.0,4389.0, Yeah.
4389.0,4391.0," Well, you know how we catch a glow."
4391.0,4392.0, Love and some techno.
4392.0,4400.0," Yeah, when we go out, you can thank Petrie DeHan from the Netherlands for our out going theme today."
4400.0,4405.0, And he is on one up if you want to send him a message with your.
4405.0,4408.0, Your opinions about his but be nice because he did this.
4408.0,4412.0, He sent us all the way from the Netherlands and remember that music because.
4412.0,4415.0, It's pretty common in Europe.
4415.0,4418.0," So right, there's still on that tip."
4418.0,4420.0, And so my.
4420.0,4424.0," Uh, anyway, his name is the Dutch Slayer over on one up true."
4424.0,4427.0," And so let's go for the, obviously, Dutch master."
4427.0,4430.0," Well, he says that no, it has nothing to do with the band's layer."
4430.0,4431.0, I never heard of the band at the time.
4431.0,4433.0, I created the nickname many years ago.
4433.0,4435.0, Flying Dutchman.
4435.0,4437.0, All right. So there's that.
4437.0,4438.0, So there we go.
4438.0,4439.0, There we go. Thank you.
4439.0,4440.0, As we roll out.
4440.0,4441.0, Is that it for us?
4441.0,4442.0, I don't know.
4442.0,4443.0," No, you didn't even do your hair."
4443.0,4444.0," So the web, man."
4444.0,4445.0," Or, uh, okay."
4445.0,4447.0," Well, then yeah, we just, we just set them up for one at the time."
4447.0,4448.0, Okay.
4448.0,4449.0, Okay.
4449.0,4451.0," So like when you hear the song, just remember this."
4451.0,4453.0," But there, I didn't even know if I was ready for this, but okay."
4453.0,4454.0, So.
4454.0,4456.0," I kind of found this, uh, man."
4456.0,4458.0, I forgot a reader.
4458.0,4461.0," I mean, a listener sent me a personal message through."
4461.0,4466.0, Oneup.com and tipped me off to a post by a guy named Naniwavmah.
4466.0,4468.0, And that was hilarious.
4468.0,4470.0," And unfortunately, didn't print correctly."
4470.0,4472.0, So I couldn't read the whole thing.
4472.0,4474.0, But what I did was I took this guy's name.
4474.0,4479.0," And I put it in, you know, as a search term in Google and found that he's busy guy."
4479.0,4484.0," So he's posting on like, you're fee forums, which is a term for when Furies"
4484.0,4485.0, Copyulate.
4485.0,4486.0," And uh, what's a copy?"
4486.0,4487.0," You're fee, you're fee."
4487.0,4488.0, You're fee.
4488.0,4489.0, You're fee.
4489.0,4490.0, You're fee.
4490.0,4491.0, You're fee.
4491.0,4492.0, I F F I.
4492.0,4493.0," Why, I F F I."
4493.0,4494.0, Yeah.
4494.0,4495.0," It was like, you're gonna go."
4495.0,4496.0, Go.
4496.0,4497.0, Later.
4497.0,4498.0, Because I said.
4498.0,4499.0, I said the link to a friend.
4499.0,4500.0," He was like, you're gonna go."
4500.0,4503.0, I don't think a link that starts with you fee.
4503.0,4504.0, Yeah.
4504.0,4505.0, So.
4505.0,4506.0," Well, I don't have that."
4506.0,4510.0," I found the same guy posting on the, the fantasism forum."
4510.0,4513.0, And Naniwavmahn.
4513.0,4516.0," Um, it was basically his original post."
4516.0,4519.0, What it revealed to me was that he was saying that.
4520.0,4526.0," It's, it's social pressure, essentially, that makes us, that, that makes, you know, a straight man think that like,"
4526.0,4530.0," Charlie's their own as a track, whatever, and that way."
4530.0,4532.0," It's just, social pressure."
4532.0,4533.0," Well, that it's entirely."
4533.0,4534.0, Yeah.
4534.0,4536.0," I mean, well, clearly, you know, whatever."
4536.0,4537.0, Clear.
4537.0,4539.0, I think he was willing to see this.
4539.0,4542.0," I'm extent that, yes, like, um, I don't know."
4542.0,4543.0, I'm getting off.
4543.0,4547.0," Wait, if we could just, if we could just admit, if we could take the social pressure off and just admit it to our self."
4547.0,4550.0, Then you would like what he likes.
4550.0,4551.0," Oh, okay."
4551.0,4552.0," Oh, I see."
4552.0,4553.0," Oh, I see."
4553.0,4555.0," So it's not, I should have freed himself."
4555.0,4556.0, It's not his problem.
4556.0,4559.0," The character that, he must be called the character must be known as Naniwavmahn."
4559.0,4561.0, The Japanese version of the game.
4561.0,4562.0, Okay.
4562.0,4563.0," But Ryan, help me."
4563.0,4564.0, This is just Final Fantasy.
4564.0,4565.0, It's not seven.
4565.0,4566.0, Is it that seven?
4566.0,4567.0, That's 13.
4567.0,4568.0," Yeah, that's seven."
4568.0,4570.0, Is basically a lion.
4570.0,4572.0," Um, a very mean one."
4572.0,4573.0, Yeah.
4573.0,4574.0, I'm tattoos.
4574.0,4575.0, That he's attracted to.
4575.0,4585.0," So when this thing he goes on and he's talking about how, you know, how gorgeous and everyone would, you know, the scales would fall from their eyes and they would see how gorgeous and live and ferocious, uh, read 13 is."
4585.0,4586.0, Wow.
4586.0,4587.0, So he's like out of the matrix.
4587.0,4589.0, We're definitely out of matrix.
4589.0,4590.0, We're definitely out of matrix.
4590.0,4591.0, Like in our world.
4591.0,4592.0, Something.
4592.0,4593.0, Okay.
4593.0,4595.0, It's the way to the laughing.
4595.0,4596.0, Yeah.
4596.0,4597.0, It's a pretty functional.
4597.0,4598.0, Okay.
4598.0,4599.0, Oh.
4599.0,4604.98," So Naniwavmahn, pose as the question to his fellow fantasism form goers that would are"
4604.98,4606.98, characters really want us.
4606.98,4609.98," And he says, wow, I'm not even ready for it."
4609.98,4610.98, I got an end of voice for this.
4610.98,4613.98, I actually had when I was singing about in a rudo.
4613.98,4614.98, I came up with some other voice.
4614.98,4616.98, I already forgot what I wanted to know.
4616.98,4617.98, Maybe I need to be no nerd.
4617.98,4618.98, But okay.
4618.98,4625.98," I just had a thought that if Naniwavmahn key were really physical on this world, what are the chances he would want me?"
4625.98,4627.98, I'm so passionate about him.
4627.98,4631.98, But I think my wanting to be around him so much would simply drive him crazy.
4631.98,4634.98," No, not he doesn't seem to type to want to settle down."
4634.98,4638.98," And from his experiences, we didn't really like to get that friendly with humans."
4638.98,4642.98," In a way, I'm glad that I can have him only in my thoughts and dreams."
4642.98,4645.98," If he were real and rejected me, it would hurt badly."
4645.98,4650.98," No, he can only hope to dedicate much of my time to showing him."
4650.98,4654.98," Whoever I think he is, that I do indeed can't for him."
4654.98,4655.98, Okay.
4655.98,4659.98, So not only is he fantasizing about this animated creature.
4659.98,4662.98, He's already neurotic and needy for him.
4662.98,4663.98, Exactly.
4663.98,4667.98, Why would he get him to therapy in a bad way?
4667.98,4668.98, Why would 13 call me?
4668.98,4670.98," Postor, a nigma 30."
4670.98,4671.98, I'll play hard to get.
4671.98,4672.98, Then he'll want me.
4672.98,4679.98," Postor, a nigma 13 who takes his avatar and his whatever after I can't tell."
4679.98,4680.98, I can't tell.
4680.98,4681.98, Is that Digimon or Pokemon?
4681.98,4682.98, Some piece of shit.
4682.98,4683.98, I think that.
4683.98,4684.98, Blue ZX for that.
4684.98,4685.98, Excuse me.
4685.98,4686.98, They're very good.
4686.98,4687.98, Okay.
4687.98,4688.98, So here's a preview too.
4688.98,4689.98, Okay.
4689.98,4690.98, Here he goes.
4690.98,4691.98, What's your Pokemon?
4691.98,4693.98, It's a critical question in the answers.
4693.98,4695.98, Different for all of us.
4695.98,4699.98, Some of us love malicious characters with sooner kill you than love you.
4699.98,4703.98, In those cases we may be a little unrealistic in our hopes.
4703.98,4704.98, Here's how I see it.
4704.98,4706.98, I think that this immense need.
4706.98,4711.98, This love is something so strong that when we meet our characters it will be something
4711.98,4713.98, that they can't deny.
4713.98,4717.98," I don't know about you, but if I can meet one of my loves and be friends, I'd be fine."
4717.98,4722.98," I think if we don't approach them like crazy, love, needy, freaks, then we have a chance"
4722.98,4723.98, with any one of them.
4723.98,4729.98," And if we finally find them and ruin it by acting like possessive fools, then they'll"
4729.98,4732.98, probably take it as they get away from you.
4732.98,4736.98," But if you call me approach them, let me know."
4736.98,4739.98, He immense passion you feel.
4739.98,4740.98, They made me to it.
4740.98,4742.98," He had, they may not."
4742.98,4744.98, This guy has a way better chance of scoring.
4745.98,4746.98, I believe it.
4746.98,4749.98, He shows some sympathy to our situation.
4749.98,4751.98, He's going to rap late out.
4751.98,4752.98, He does.
4752.98,4754.98, So I think he's a guy who joins in.
4754.98,4755.98, Okay.
4755.98,4757.98, This is a debate here.
4757.98,4759.98," No, no, no, no."
4759.98,4762.98, Now should we approach our animals.
4762.98,4767.98, It's either Gilman or Galman and this is definitely a Digimon.
4767.98,4769.98," He says,"
4770.98,4778.98," I agree with the Digimon and with the one I love, Galman is an affectionate loving, caring"
4778.98,4779.98, Digimon.
4779.98,4782.98, He would be happy someone likes him so much.
4782.98,4785.98, Of course he may not understand it first.
4785.98,4791.98, Part of he'd grow into it and then he'd eventually tell the same amount of means.
4791.98,4794.98, Long as I show him the way I feel.
4794.98,4798.98, I'm sure the Naki would be the same way.
4798.98,4800.98, Maybe not as playful.
4800.98,4802.98, Maybe not as trusting.
4802.98,4805.98, Maybe not as friendly as Galman would be at first.
4805.98,4808.98, But he'd eventually get there.
4808.98,4810.98, Naki's not a cruel person.
4810.98,4812.98, He's kindhearted and a little naive.
4812.98,4815.98, Of course there's a chance for both of you.
4815.98,4818.98," Then, okay, let's just keep going."
4818.98,4820.98, We actually did you notice we had some walk by.
4820.98,4824.98," Yeah, we had a couple of people on the fifth floor walk by and get a weird voice."
4824.98,4825.98," Yeah, they're like that."
4825.98,4827.98, So let's take a little too close to home.
4827.98,4833.98," Yeah, so, um, on a more liberal note, if there's psychology as similar to that of humans,"
4833.98,4834.98, they have libido.
4834.98,4837.98, There's always a chance your character could be into you.
4837.98,4840.98," Even if he's not human, that would be interesting."
4840.98,4842.98," Yeah, okay."
4842.98,4846.98," Then the super spastic one that's going to, that they're going to call security on me if I do again,"
4846.98,4854.98, says that he hopes his character would be into him because he has a long standing plan to marry him.
4854.98,4856.98, I've got to walk by a rude it now.
4856.98,4857.98, I'm going to blame it on him.
4857.98,4859.98, Why can't they come down to do it?
4859.98,4860.98, Do it.
4860.98,4861.98, Do it.
4861.98,4862.98, Go ahead.
4862.98,4863.98, Can you get your best shot?
4863.98,4864.98, Okay.
4864.98,4866.98," Okay, so actually, here's a normal point."
4866.98,4871.98," So Steve, an unregistered poster who could very well be the person who tipped me off to this all"
4871.98,4873.98, of the shenanigans comes in and says they wouldn't.
4873.98,4877.98, You aren't there kind chances are they would just use your for your money and leave you.
4877.98,4879.98," Is this actually, we'll get over it."
4879.98,4882.98," And then, Naki, my 13 response."
4883.98,4887.98," Well, that's pretty sad view of things depends on who you're talking about."
4887.98,4891.98," For example, if you're a Digimon lover, it doesn't matter if you're Digimon loves your not."
4891.98,4893.98, It'll be by your side always.
4893.98,4896.98," See, may as well add some intimacy to the relationship."
4896.98,4897.98, I got all.
4897.98,4899.98," Okay, that's hot right there."
4899.98,4900.98, Yeah.
4900.98,4904.98," Um, but for other characters that may indeed be the case."
4904.98,4907.98," The question is, will it be worth it just to have seen them?"
4907.98,4909.98," I think we have a, we need to have a link to red because obviously,"
4909.98,4911.98, guys logic.
4911.98,4912.98," Okay, let's go back to it."
4912.98,4913.98, Yeah.
4913.98,4917.98," You think that logic, since that since they won't leave you anyway, you might as well have sex with them."
4917.98,4918.98, Yeah.
4918.98,4919.98," So, it's a point of Digimon."
4919.98,4921.98, It doesn't matter whether they like you are not because they're by your side.
4921.98,4924.98," So, I guess they might as well bone on anything about Digimon."
4924.98,4927.98, But assuming it's just like Pokemon and they're kind of slaves.
4927.98,4930.98," No, I have you know they're totally different."
4930.98,4932.98," No, obey you no matter what you do."
4932.98,4936.98," So, you might as well, in his words, you might as well add some intimacy to the relationship."
4937.98,4943.98," I, I, I shutter to think about what someone takes that kind of reasoning to their, their pets and everything else."
4943.98,4947.98," Yeah, that guy shouldn't be allowed to have cat on them."
4947.98,4950.98," To our children, they're anything."
4950.98,4953.98, You should be allowed to have like a goldfish in a bowl.
4953.98,4956.98, But the fish back on you.
4956.98,4958.98," Oh, there's more."
4958.98,4960.98, I'm losing my voice if you're doing those voices.
4960.98,4962.98," So, I don't know if we'll maybe we'll have to continue it next week."
4962.98,4965.98, But this debate goes on and on and on.
4965.98,4966.48, Wow.
4966.48,4968.48, This is far from settled.
4968.48,4968.98, Okay.
4968.98,4974.48," If you need a chime in and you're listening, you think that maybe, oh, God, Goboomon, Joyce."
4974.48,4982.48," And if you think that Goboomon or Miracle Maker and the Naki Wolfman or Nigma 13 or right, let us know."
4982.48,4984.48, It'd be interesting to say here what listeners think.
4984.48,4986.48," Yeah, what are the opinions up there?"
4986.48,4990.48," Should you, might as you, should you just go ahead and have sex with your Digimon?"
4990.48,4992.48, Should you respect them more?
4992.48,4994.48, Do you think that they would actually like you?
4994.48,4997.48, They like you better if you played a little harder to get.
4997.48,5002.48," Say, you know, it's just kind of a love lines for as always for what are they called?"
5002.48,5003.48," Yiffy, you're stupid."
5003.48,5004.48, Yiffy love lines.
5004.48,5007.48, We're so used to this stuff now that won't open it.
5007.48,5010.48," You know, there would have been a time a few years ago."
5010.48,5012.48," If I had seen this, you would have called the cops."
5012.48,5015.48," There would be no, no, there would be no way I would not for a moment,"
5015.48,5016.48, believe this could be true.
5016.48,5022.48," The fact if you told me, you were that you loved Laura Croft and you were wondering if she would like you back."
5022.48,5024.48, I always think you're the biggest deep shit I ever listened to.
5024.48,5028.48," But then when you flipped it up, when you flipped the script and you come back and you were fucking Digimon,"
5028.48,5030.48, I would not believe that at all.
5030.48,5032.48, There would be no way.
5032.48,5033.48, Right.
5033.48,5035.48, But now we're so used to it.
5035.48,5039.48, Maybe we could be like a call like a advice line.
5039.48,5041.48," You know, like love lines."
5041.48,5043.48, We could have people call in with.
5043.48,5046.48, Let's embrace them because we got so much rage out of these dudes.
5046.48,5048.48," You know what, calling calls your problems."
5048.48,5049.48," Well, what will help you?"
5049.48,5054.48," I wonder if you should, if you should, you know, not be so needy in front of your Digimon."
5054.48,5055.48," Well, well, a vancers for you."
5055.48,5058.48," Yeah, just give me your personal cell phone number Jeff."
5058.48,5061.48," Well, we're told call it call me at."
5061.48,5065.48," I always felt I was grass type, but squirtle was a little bit funny."
5065.48,5071.48," We could, that's my little desire."
5071.48,5074.48," We, so we're not making fun of these people though."
5074.48,5075.48, We are.
5075.48,5076.48," We did this exact, though."
5076.48,5077.48, First time he had sonic passions.
5077.48,5078.48, You said the same thing.
5078.48,5079.48," Oh, I am."
5079.48,5080.48," Oh, yeah, you're right."
5080.48,5081.48, We told you.
5081.48,5085.48," And then I got someone yelled at me on our message boards for being like, I don't know, close"
5085.48,5086.48, mind it or something.
5086.48,5087.48, It doesn't hurt anyone.
5087.48,5091.48," It was like, well, that doesn't mean I can't, like, and laugh at it."
5091.48,5095.48, Like it takes me somewhere straight to not laugh at that.
5095.48,5097.48," Well, you're just close minded."
5097.48,5098.48, You're close minded.
5098.48,5102.48," I don't think you should touch your Digimon, especially if they don't, they aren't"
5102.48,5103.48, able to protest.
5104.48,5106.48," Especially if they don't, if they don't, if they don't, they're not into you."
5106.48,5107.48," Moral, moral ground there."
5107.48,5108.48, You're crossing.
5108.48,5110.48, Especially if you're being needy for them.
5110.48,5111.48, Why won't you love me?
5111.48,5114.48," And if they can only say, Pika, I've trained you."
5114.48,5117.48, How do we need the documentary on this?
5117.48,5120.48," You know, in the way that we've got like trekkies out there, which is great."
5120.48,5127.48," And all their documentaries called Yoke, Oki Newtling about fishing in Oklahoma with"
5127.48,5128.48, your fist for catfish.
5128.48,5130.48, You basically lure about of anyway.
5130.48,5132.48," There's doc, there is a lot to add about."
5132.48,5134.48," Um, it's type of just basically hand fish."
5134.48,5137.48, Use your hand for bait and catch fish go into these mud holes.
5137.48,5139.48," And they'll be very, very large."
5139.48,5142.48," So you basically ram your, grab them off, fist down their mouth."
5142.48,5144.48, And then they clamp up on it and then you can help.
5144.48,5148.48," Then you extract it with all your might or if you don't, you drown."
5148.48,5149.48, They pull you down and down.
5149.48,5151.48," And no, it's a documentary."
5151.48,5152.48, I'm like funny.
5152.48,5153.48, Gokki Newtling.
5153.48,5154.48, Sucked into the earth by a fish.
5154.48,5155.48, Get up.
5155.48,5158.48, But so if you got done a great hobby.
5158.48,5160.48, And you got documentary on this.
5160.48,5161.48, So it's a joke.
5161.48,5163.48, Jonas doubt of documentaries on this.
5163.48,5167.48," Then we need one on, uh, I don't know what I'm asking for."
5167.48,5170.48," Yeah, become as a part."
5170.48,5172.48, Someone's going to show you how to do this tomorrow.
5172.48,5173.48, Screw it here.
5173.48,5174.48, Okay.
5174.48,5175.48, Wow.

5177.48,5179.48," We had, we had, we talked about nothing but games for the entire,"
5179.48,5180.48, We did.

5186.48,5188.48," So those of you who stood up this morning, everything but games."
5188.48,5189.48, That's kind of what happened.
5189.48,5191.48, You made faces when we wanted to talk about games.
5191.48,5192.48, I know.
5192.48,5194.48," Sean, we're not done."
5194.48,5195.48," Yeah, if you stuff that."
5195.48,5196.48, I had a stink face on.
5196.48,5198.48, It was all too serious.
5198.48,5199.48, Yeah.
5199.48,5201.48," It was like I, I sharded or something."
5201.48,5203.48, So I had a bad face.
