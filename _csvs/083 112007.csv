159.60000000000002,161.92000000000002, As soon as I was like talking about bringing my kid there
162.07999999999998,168.23999999999998," He didn't ask if you wanted to subscribe to game informery. Yeah, he didn't or yeah, or ask if like or my name is manager"

190.56,193.67999999999998, You know they right they talk like this guy so far
194.32,196.64, Talk tells which eb it was so this guy gets fired
197.35999999999999,199.35999999999999, Not until then
199.35999999999999,203.28, I heard a story I can't remember if I knew the person or if this is like one of those
204.0,207.67999999999998," Her been legend things got past me, but I but I I think I knew a person who"
208.48,212.48," Was an employee at Disneyland? No, this is true. I'm not making this up. They were employee"
213.04,216.32, They were in a play it Disneyland and they sold popcorn out near
217.6,219.6, front here land and
220.48,225.35999999999999, They were selling the popcorn and a person came out to them and asked for a bag of popcorn and
225.92,230.95999999999998, They the the dude poured the popcorn and then the person like went into their wall and so like oh man
230.95999999999998,231.67999999999998, I
231.67999999999998,236.39999999999998," I don't have any money. I thought I had some money and it goes like well, I can't give you the popcorn and then he's like"
236.95999999999998,240.39999999999998," Come on man. It's like one bag of popcorn. I mean, who's gonna know whatever? I'm sorry"
240.39999999999998,245.51999999999998, I just I'm out of money and I'm hungry and the guy gave him the popcorn and then 15 minutes later
246.16,251.04000000000002, Dude's come over and fire him and like take him out. It was a sad not take it out. They didn't kill it
252.24,255.68, It was like a secret shop bird to make sure he wasn't giving away free fucks app
256.96000000000004,260.38," Yeah, because Walt Disney was gonna really lose out from that two-cent"
260.88,266.24, popcorn when you did the sad thing about working the more patient the job is you work at the more
266.88,269.92, Everyone else in there wants to remind you how piss in it is
270.48,276.72, So like if there's like an assistant manager or something which means he makes maybe like two pesos more than you a week and he'll
277.44,283.20000000000005, Lored it over you and just make your life as miserable as possible and then the person above him does the same and you're at some point like
283.6,285.28000000000003, Dude we're all here
285.28000000000003,290.32, I'm selling popcorn at the fucking theme park and you're watching me so pop from it the theme park
290.32,291.52000000000004," Yeah, but instead of being like"
291.76,294.08000000000004," Dude, we got a quit selling popcorn at this team"
294.08,297.76," Uh-huh, then you're like right I'm gonna sell the man keep it down"
299.12,301.12, That's right divide and conquer me
301.12,305.03999999999996, You know both a popcorn seller and the guy you know spying on the popcorn guy
305.28,308.88, They need to just march to the to the manners off and like kick his ass
309.68,312.4, Take over 97.5 to revolution
312.71999999999997,317.36, They have to work at least live in fear of the theater checkers because they would be you know
317.36,319.91999999999996, I'm supposed people you never know and then you get a report later saying
320.88,324.64000000000004, Sean you you didn't upsell to a large you didn't even try it exactly
325.36,327.36, Salto a large yeah
327.36,329.36, You want to see you want to see medium
329.76,332.96000000000004, Are you sure you don't want to large and if they don't have a drink you ask them
333.44,338.08000000000004, Would you like a drink with I hate people do that to me? There's always another one sure that's why order to medium
338.64,343.12, I don't have to tone that down now after super size me because I got to go that rep
343.12,349.12, I feel like that doesn't happen me much anymore not not aggressive salesmanship though and yeah up like because even
350.0,355.52000000000004," You be that's when you call you being they're trying to tell you about pre orders and yeah, yeah stuff and then like you know"
355.52000000000004,360.08000000000004, You don't want to stretch you guide with that back back when I worked back when I worked at music land
360.56,363.20000000000005, We would always have you know with the discount card
363.76,369.6, And in record we would always have to offer to everybody every time and then we would have to ask people you know
369.6,371.6, Do you want to pre order this this and this?
371.6,375.28000000000003, Did you feel like a jackass and then and then if they paid with a credit card
375.44,379.04, We always had to put like a little flyer and finally go like oh I see you're paying with a credit card
379.12,381.12, Would you like two free weeks of entertainment weekly?
382.24,383.12, Would you like that?
383.12,388.0, Save 10% on this purchase and then you have to get a credit card for every single place like why do you need a
388.08000000000004,391.84000000000003, Johnmadgeese credit card or like yeah a 711 like slurpy card?
392.40000000000003,396.72," Well, um and then when they give me that attitude to like now I'm just gonna use my cast"
397.12,401.92," Okay, but they really they want to use your job with this card. Okay, they're really on your ass about doing that"
401.92,406.24, If you work at those places because I actually worked at fun coland in college which turned into
406.88,413.92, GameStop right now everything's here whatever yeah and and my manager was in total freak about that stuff
413.92,417.68, And I just refused to try to sell people game and former or whatever
417.68,420.72, They're trying to get me to say they make you wear a lot of flare to no
421.12,425.84000000000003, But I actually had to go work with the the district manager who was like the best salesman in Texas
426.24,428.88, And she would just flat out light of people about anything
428.88,435.28000000000003, That's like you need this cleaning kit when you buy a brand new game to get the wax off of the the contact strips in the cartridge
435.52,437.52, She would tell people that
437.52,444.15999999999997," That's fantastic. Yeah, anyway, didn't you need a quote? You had to meet every week. Yeah, I never did at safe"
444.15999999999997,445.35999999999996, I happened
445.35999999999996,446.88, refired no it was
447.11999999999995,449.44, Suckers they couldn't get anybody else to do that job
450.08,456.96, Job was ridiculous when I worked at safe way it was the same principle where the rule at the time was every time you make eye contact with someone
457.11999999999995,458.4, You need to
458.4,459.52, greet them
459.52,464.71999999999997," Ask them if they're finding everything okay, and then if they say that they're oh, I'm looking for this"
465.44,470.15999999999997, And which the problem is is that when you stop most people like like us they don't want to talk to you
470.15999999999997,474.4, But the others like oh someone's talking to me. I better think of some good answer
474.4,479.44, What am I looking for and then they make something up and then the next rule is that you have to go and take them to it
479.76,482.08, physically touch the item and then
482.79999999999995,487.91999999999996, Recommend a complimentary purchase so the example in the training video was that someone was asking for hot-time
487.91999999999996,495.03999999999996," Mind you and the guys like you know like oh, man, did you get you get pickles with that and then then it was known in the story"
495.04,496.48, Is given the customer the pickle
499.12,501.12, So
501.12,504.40000000000003, Like intensely and if you're eating when you're you're stalking the shelves
504.40000000000003,509.6," You know, this was like a long time ago and I first started working to encourage stores and you're you're trying to get to the other into the store"
509.6,514.32, Right and then you stop someone because every time you pass when you're supposed to make eye contact say hi
514.32,519.36," And it's this infinite or grass like my end goes to go put this case of beer over in the beer aisle, right?"
519.36,522.9200000000001, But someone asked me where something about the produce and then you go back over to the other end of the store
523.0,527.3199999999999," Touch it and do it then you're like okay, I'm gonna go back to my cart and do it, but nope, there's someone else in a smile"
527.3199999999999,532.64, I got to do it again. So wait a little touch their produce you just touch something
533.5999999999999,539.24, And then so meanwhile there's the the mirrors up in the top and then over the management booth is you're always looking up there like
539.4799999999999,544.7199999999999, Is that guy Billy Compton was the manager and this is why I want to tell a story ultimately about Billy Compton and he
545.1999999999999,548.76, That old Billy Compton would look down through there and you'd see him looking at you and you like
549.28,551.56," Wait, it's only a well-earned. It was like the pan-off"
551.56,553.56, The city there would watching you guys
553.64,556.28, Watching us to make sure the background of the market
556.28,562.4799999999999," Yeah, it's a look at their across the store. Yeah, through the two-a mirrors to make sure everyone is doing it"
562.4799999999999,565.78, Some satisfying and we had secret shoppers come in at least once a week
565.78,570.4799999999999," You know, and that they would evaluate this, but then we had these things called huddles and I don't want this to seem racist"
570.4799999999999,575.76," This I'm this is the best like in personate this guy and he did speak this way, but so he would"
576.4399999999999,578.56, He would have these huddles. It was his idea
578.56,580.68, So all of a sudden we're working on the intercom here
580.8399999999999,585.0, Tent you safe way employees huddle up time to huddle up. Let's huddle up
585.0799999999999,587.0799999999999, So we'd have to run to the back room
587.0799999999999,591.9399999999999, We run to the back room and he'd like you know closer closer and we'd all get in this like you know
591.9399999999999,597.04, Circle like a like it's a huddle that football game and then he would start saying like okay
597.04,602.3199999999999," It's summertime what's going sell what's going sell coke, Peppy, Freed O' Light,"
602.32,605.4000000000001, Death Hayes money and then like we're sitting there
605.9200000000001,610.0," You know, we're just trying to get the shit stock on the shelves and this guy's telling you this guy"
610.0,615.24, You're like this is fucked up right and then he's he was so condescending
615.24,621.7800000000001, But there's this kid Eli who's his bagger is a total shit for braids and he looks and he's telling me he's like who here
621.7800000000001,628.86, Want to tell me about game sharing game sharing and game sharing was that if we got enough secret shop reports that were just like glowing in
629.04,633.28, Their report at the end of the year we'd get like an extra five cents tacked on to every
633.8000000000001,640.82, $200 we earned or something like this and then so he would break it down and remind us that we we stood to gain another
640.82,646.02, What three bucks at the end of the year and then he looks around and he's like tell me what it means and then he goes
646.42,649.02, You go even Eli knows what that means
649.34,650.14, Monty
650.14,652.14, Monty
653.34,656.34," And he lies all looking like yeah, I know what it means"
656.34,658.34," No, it means I don't know"
659.02,663.0600000000001, All but it was just red because like it's bad enough to have to talk to someone and do all that
663.0600000000001,665.38," But then when that's in the background, you know, you can be like"
666.0600000000001,668.0600000000001, Called to the hotel of any
668.0600000000001,672.94, You gotta think that there's somebody you know at the corporate headquarters of any
673.5,679.38, Large entity who sits in a room thinking about like you know whether there's any more dignity
679.38,687.9, They can straight for some small profit on level of their like
687.9,691.5, I'm close to have a monochem of happiness and and dignity
691.5,694.9," Yeah, you know, can we do to destroy that Barbara Aaron right?"
695.54,698.18, This is just some interesting books and then Nicola and Dynes
698.18,702.5, She does make a point where in for the for the research phase of writing this book
702.5,706.98, She's been a year trying to make a living on minimum wage jobs throughout the country and
707.54,711.62," All different types of work, so you know cleaning turning over hotel rooms and stuff"
711.62,716.9, But one phase was at Walmart and at both Walmart and Target should point it out that during the interviewing process
716.9,722.94, You fill out these questionnaires or which are really psychological profiles and it's all information that
723.4200000000001,731.34, The employer really wouldn't need you know stuff that you really wouldn't wouldn't need but but she was convinced that the questions are put together in such a way that
731.62,735.38, The person taking the exam everyone knows it's like it's just
736.1,737.6," Yeah, sorry"
737.6,742.02, So you look at them and everyone knows there's only one right way to answer it if I want this job
742.02,744.74, This is the correct answer right and it's and
745.14,749.74, Her case is that Walmart and Target know this way too and the point is not that like oh
749.74,752.66, How can we make this cheat proof and how can we get people to be honest?
752.66,759.5, But it's a lesson in advance of like this is who you need to be for us and you already need to start in
759.5,765.62, In addition to the drug screening and stuff this is where we start stripping your dignity by telling you exactly how you have to answer
765.62,769.22," Every little thing along the way, but I don't know I thought that was interesting and yeah"
769.22,773.66, I've worked in a lot of jobs like that and I agree with it. They're pretty damn
773.94,775.3, Yeah
775.3,776.66, Not so much
776.66,779.98, I mean you know this oh cuz you were you were calling the guy db
780.22,782.22," Yeah, that's right"
782.22,786.34," Yeah, yeah, they don't know I've had games strip me of my dignity as well"
787.1,788.1, Nice
788.1,790.1, I'm making a foot
790.1,793.1, We don't get much of the dignity stripping I hear at
793.9,795.82, ZF do we now you do it all yourself
795.82,798.7, You're the we strip our dignity before we begin
798.7,803.64," Yeah, don't pass up the opportunity to follow up on on Roberts opening there before we start recording"
803.64,808.0600000000001, You were just telling us that you had been having more sex with women in the Witcher oh
808.78,810.78, Me so stripping dignity
812.78,815.9," That's not stripping dignity. No, that was increasing my dignity"
818.26,822.5400000000001," And my and my manliness quotient. Yeah, I slept with since our last pack class"
822.5400000000001,826.02, I slept with two more women actually tried to sleep with a third one
826.14,829.14, She told me to meet her at the like old-win mill
829.86,831.4200000000001, Like the after sunset
831.4200000000001,832.94, Red you have to actually go through yesterday
832.94,835.44," Right, then the bed stood me up"
836.94,838.94, She had a game this trip me of my dignity
840.66,846.86, Now that would have been good right that's like that would have been so great. Yeah condition you in the same way like
848.62,852.86, Condemned or something you teach as you hey open every longer you see because you get ammo
852.86,858.22, They're like an hour in you open one in a booky man pops out right so this would be like that would have been
858.22,861.1800000000001, Just he's happy. He's beddy is and then off a sudden one of my sense
861.1800000000001,864.66, You and then the guys beat the shit out would have been great take half of your yeah
864.66,866.66," Yeah, what you hear for boner boy"
867.86,870.1, I mean it just like beat the shit out of me. Yeah
870.1,877.02," What about these totally cock-block? He was in a glitch or what I don't know what happened. Yeah, but need us to say I was I was a little else"
877.02,879.66, Little frustrated her was she just there to give you a quest or something
880.06,888.06," She was she was there to give you a quest. She was the quest. Yeah. Yeah. She was my quest. No, I like did something for I did like a quest of third and then she's like"
888.06,891.18, I like you which are you know come meet me tomorrow
891.5,893.66, You in and like you had the choice. I was like yeah
893.66,899.42," Yeah, yes or no and I said yes, so then it like you know I'm doing another quest and then you know in the game the sun sets and I'm like"
899.42,901.42," Woo, it's time man"
903.0999999999999,905.62, So I also across the map to the win-me-one
905.62,911.38, I'm standing around like some fucking dip shit junior high kid waiting for this day to doesn't show me
911.38,916.86," Oh, man, yeah, and I'm sitting there with the clock the game clock spinning. It's like seven o'clock eight o'clock"
916.86,921.24, I got to be doing other things with the game. I'm like I guess. He's not gonna show. Oh
921.24,923.74, I do this real quick
924.14,929.58," Since it's just a perfect opportunity. Yeah, back in that same safe way and you're gonna see the connection"
929.58,931.74," No, that's everything with you. I'm gonna"
931.74,936.58," Yeah, that same safe way there is a guy who had cleaned the meat department at the end of the night. He would come in and eat"
936.58,941.94, I don't know where to and I would always talk to this dude and I went back there one night and I was like hey
942.58,948.94, Someone was just asking for you. You know this this woman was just asking about you and he was immediately getting all excited and lit up
948.94,953.3000000000001, And I saw like proceeded to describe her and basically what I was doing was describing the cool-aid man
953.3000000000001,955.3000000000001, But without saying it was the cool-aid man
956.62,964.2600000000001," So you mean like the guy with the I was like she was where I started off. You know, she was wearing red dress and she was really like"
964.7,966.0600000000001, Curved
966.0600000000001,968.1400000000001, She was really hurt and so I just oh yeah
968.1400000000001,969.1, And then he
969.1,974.62," Yeah, so he was going to describing he'd asked for more information and I'd provide it and it was just she kept getting bigger and bigger"
974.62,977.44," So I said well she was yes, she was asking all about you"
977.44,981.9, And so that was the setup then I went to this girl that I knew who who was one of the kind of shears and I told her
981.9,986.94," Hey, here's the extension for the meat department. You got a call right now and just say you know"
986.94,992.62," So she gals him and she's like hey, I was you know, just doing a little shopping and I I saw you back there"
992.94,997.54," And I want to know and this guy had kids, you know, he had a wife and kids and he was like I want to"
997.54,1003.1800000000001, I want to come in tonight meet you. Can you stay there to like you know midnight and he normally gets out there or tan or something and so
1003.6999999999999,1006.8599999999999, Sure enough all night I kept going back. He's back there whistling and shit
1008.14,1010.78, Like mop in the meat department floor like whistle all guys
1014.62,1017.18," That's yeah anyway, there you go"
1019.18,1021.9," You are him jump. Yeah, I was there my was okay"
1022.9,1029.82, Other than that though still it's still a great game. I got to say loving the wicker highly recommended if you're an RPG fan
1030.22,1033.5, If you're not I don't know if there's one's gonna convince you that this is the one you should play
1034.7,1039.5, But is there is there anything about it that feels particularly like for in an interesting way?
1039.5,1041.1799999999998, I mean do you play it and you're like there's something
1041.98,1047.82," Audibut this that feels like it's you know not from where I'm used to playing games, you know"
1047.82,1054.3," I mean because of the fact that you're a pianist. Yeah, yeah, like some like the game is stalker right has this like really"
1054.9399999999998,1058.9399999999998, Strange vibe to it that well you would never see in an an American
1058.94,1064.06," Yeah, there is a bit of an odd vibe and I would say that the dialogue is actually a little more"
1065.5800000000002,1068.06, adult and you know there is some like cheesy
1068.94,1073.8200000000002, Fantasy you know stuff that that all these games have that you can either buy into or not
1074.6200000000001,1080.14, And you know we've we've made fun of the the having sex thing here on this podcast before even though
1080.14,1084.38," I've actually now done it three times in the game, but the things that happened wrong"
1084.46,1088.46, If you spend this whole whole game killing or shit and they it's called role-playing
1088.94,1092.0600000000002," If it's gonna be any kind of life it's gotta have sex in it, but the fact"
1093.3400000000001,1098.0600000000002, That's the fact that's how I feel as the Witcher yeah feeling like I've earned this
1098.7,1101.66, I've been killing monsters all day got damn right
1104.22,1107.2600000000002," Yeah, pour me a bear and you know"
1107.66,1113.02," No, but it's not yourself down there the lady for it, but it's like it's cool"
1113.02,1116.86, Just like we're saying the potential there to mess with you. I mean like even having you get
1116.86,1119.98," Ganked I mean that would have been incredible, but even the fact that she stood you up is red"
1119.98,1124.78, There's well that might have been a glitch or maybe I did maybe I didn't read the quest text right
1124.78,1129.18," Maybe she said get there before five and I got there after five yeah, maybe he's not hurt"
1129.74,1132.62," Maybe I went to the wrong place. Yeah, it wasn't like my fine"
1133.1799999999998,1137.26, Spend the rest of your time playing and find her and figure it out. She's upset and then gank her
1138.06,1140.06," Yeah, where the hell were you?"
1140.78,1146.54," A proper tension and everything so I mean, but I think that part of it even though you can kind of make fun of it"
1146.54,1150.1399999999999, And it is a little bit cheesy the fact that it does exist in the game
1151.02,1155.7399999999998, I think is a not kind of non-American thing don't you think? I mean this even that's actually for sure
1157.4199999999998,1162.1399999999999, I'm always I'm always attracted to that sort of strangeness
1162.78,1169.34, And a game I guess because so many games do share so many similar things and when when there's in an RPG
1169.34,1173.9799999999998, I'm not an RPG player and the thing that drives me crazy about RPGs is always the combat
1174.2199999999998,1178.3, It's always the things around that like getting laid by milkmades or doing some other
1178.6999999999998,1182.2199999999998, Ridiculous thing that makes me want to play it like when someone's telling me about a
1182.2199999999998,1186.4599999999998," Blvd and some ridiculous thing they did even though I can't stand that game. I'm like well, that's kind of cool"
1186.86,1190.86," I actually like the combat in this game too. Yeah, I think if he didn't like it in a bliffy"
1190.86,1195.02, You actually might like it in the literature. Yep. I'm with you on that a hundred percent though
1195.02,1199.58, It's like yeah like a final fantasy seven. I remember playing that and it's like the cool part was
1200.4599999999998,1204.2199999999998, Exploiting that like if you're in a certain place in a certain time something specific happens
1204.3799999999999,1208.1399999999999, You know such as the Ferris wheel ride with the the characters and yeah
1208.4599999999998,1210.54, I think on who you go. I'll ask to go on the ride
1210.54,1214.1399999999999, I mean things like that is the combat gets boring and the games are very clearly
1214.6200000000001,1218.14, Made to be far to last far longer than they should
1218.14,1223.18," Yeah, you know, I mean you could easily condense any any given RPG and it's like yeah"
1223.18,1227.9, I'm with you. It's like there's little moments that are that's that's where the genre has potential
1228.46,1233.98, I've also experienced a few moments in this game now where like where the actual gaming part the quest part
1234.94,1241.5800000000002, And even the dialogue part has has really kind of challenged me in in some way which it never really does like you'll get
1242.1399999999999,1247.98," Four options and had a respond to a guy, you know, yeah, I want to do this or or now or whatever"
1247.98,1251.1, I've seen by or do this a couple times. I remember there was a I think it was a
1251.8999999999999,1253.74, trial wasn't it in in
1254.3,1255.6599999999999, night to the over public or
1256.54,1262.3799999999999, Co-to-two and am I gonna be alone in this now? I was gonna remember there was something where you had to see it through and then make the call
1262.9399999999998,1264.9399999999998," Right, it was that whole"
1265.4199999999998,1271.1799999999998, Mystery solving and I was talking about right right where you really could we wasn't just the choices weren't like
1271.6599999999999,1277.6599999999999, You know a a 1 a 2 a 3 where basically it was all variations on the same thing it was a clear cut
1277.6599999999999,1285.1, I'm gonna be for this guy or I'm gonna be for this other guy right and the witchers done that a few times where they really kind of like where I had to go
1285.1,1290.1399999999999, Oh shit. I know this is totally gonna change the way this plays out depending on which way I do it
1290.22,1294.22, This is all why the new fallout game looks so interesting to me
1294.22,1297.02," You know, of course they brought it in it's the first time I got to see it"
1297.4199999999998,1301.34, You talked about the demonstrations before Robert have you seen I've only read about it
1302.3,1306.78," And it is very much like that you know, I was also just talking about shorter and condensing the story"
1306.78,1312.62, But so what it is instead of like let's have these sections where we suddenly put you up against a brick wall
1312.62,1317.98, Boss and and tell that more or less tells you to go back into the wilds and grind for a while and come back in over power
1318.3799999999999,1321.1799999999998, It's shorter but every choice is supposed to have some
1321.74,1327.82," Consequence and is at least a binary choice, you know what I mean because some of the choice you're talking about Jeff or like absolutely false"
1327.8999999999999,1329.74, You know we say a one a two a three whatever
1329.74,1335.1799999999998, They're basically all lead to the same result right you can just have like exactly a snarky way to get there or
1335.74,1339.74, Sub serving it way to get there right I mean it's like yeah sure all hope you well
1339.74,1345.58," I don't really want to but I'll do it for 10 gold or no way I'm not gonna do that well. Okay, right I mean, you know"
1345.58,1347.58, They're all you're all basically just saying yes
1347.58,1352.9399999999998," Yeah, and this is a post to like you know deciding to detonate the atom bomb at the heart of a town"
1353.42,1359.5, wipe it off the map so that rather it still exists as like an irradiated wasteland within the greater
1359.5,1366.3, Great the wasteland the right for the fall-up or to let it be and continue into dry to do things and the
1366.3,1374.3, Interact in there which fall-out one and two did back in there date too as well right you're definitely making clear cut choices and how you wanted
1374.94,1376.14, to
1376.14,1379.98, To influence the world and the which are you know is doing that too?
1380.06,1384.22, I mean there there's I don't I don't want to do any spoilers which is why I'm just doing it vaguely
1384.22,1387.66, But you you get to one section after you've done a whole bunch of the main quest
1388.14,1392.54, Where it's it's clearly I kind of a no returning back moment like you got to really decide
1393.02,1395.02, How you want the rest of the game to play out
1396.22,1402.7, And to me that was another kind of adult thing that you don't often see in in games over here. I felt like
1403.34,1408.14, and even even just the whole uh the whole leveling up and that the character
1409.1000000000001,1412.46, You know the character choices you can make it's fairly complex
1413.1000000000001,1417.8200000000002," Relatively for an RPG in 2007, you know, and and all that felt very"
1418.46,1420.46, European and like we did not
1421.5,1427.74, Focus test this thing for eight million years with morons that we picked out of game spot or a game spot
1427.74,1429.74, Sorry game stop you know
1429.74,1432.7800000000002, They felt like a it feels like an adult game. You're
1432.7800000000002,1434.7, You're making that face would be shocked because I'm
1434.7,1438.6200000000001, Something our real things are going nowadays everyone's gonna take issue with everything we say
1438.6200000000001,1442.94, So I'm going to clarify that you don't that you really mean game stop because right
1442.94,1447.74," Oh, I don't mean our you know stop we're all agree on is it disgusting right and I don't mean that through"
1447.74,1450.94, Defantastic website game spot. You know we mean the store
1451.5800000000002,1455.9, Right and they're not affiliated right you know crisis is also you know of course
1456.7,1458.54, Developing Germany it's kind of
1459.02,1460.7, International but it's also
1460.94,1465.74," Large parts of the game have that same vibe, you know, we're they're not gonna hold your hand every step of the way"
1465.74,1469.5800000000002," It's clear that they I mean it it definitely has that vibe to it, you know"
1469.5800000000002,1473.66, This is something that they're willing to try then you look at it in opposition to something like
1473.98,1476.38," You know, there's a war area 51 which I want to talk about later"
1476.38,1478.8600000000001, But that's the kind of game where you're saying we're not only
1479.26,1487.26, They focused test it so much and they're so concerned about everyone getting it in an exact in the precisely the way that they want them to get it so that
1487.82,1494.46, There's audio cues someone's yelling at you in the game world what to do text appears on the screen saying and in other words
1494.94,1501.26," Here's what we want you to do and then on top of that there's a big flashing arrow and a big flashing thing, you know and all three those together"
1502.54,1506.22," It does take away from it like oh, there's no there's no experimenting with the"
1506.62,1510.86, The limits of the game world and the system. I think I think it actually comes down to the fact that
1511.74,1515.9, In Europe and and Poland when I went to visit and see the Witcher
1516.5400000000002,1521.02, They never had console gaming as any sort of popular past time there
1521.74,1527.3400000000001, Like PC gaming was it like console games that made inroads and modern times and Germany at least
1527.3400000000001,1530.7800000000002, But when I was ever in in Warsaw seeing the Witcher like
1531.42,1535.9," People just don't play console games there, you know, it's like a fine there and console games are like"
1535.9,1536.8600000000001," Dumber no, but"
1537.42,1543.98, I think that the mass market for games there is different because they've only ever played hard core
1543.98,1547.66, I see games and to them like something like balder's gate is totally like
1547.66,1549.66," That's normal. I see it. Yeah, right?"
1549.66,1554.38, That's what shooters it's like they they're means they're playing system shock and day effects and yeah
1554.38,1555.58, stuff not
1555.58,1560.06," Medal of Honor well Medal of Honor, yeah, but like not every you know the big huge"
1560.38,1562.38, Tradition of console shooters that are
1562.94,1567.74," Well, I think we certainly could probably spend the next few hours talking about the main streaming of gaming"
1567.74,1570.6200000000001, Equing the dumbing down of lots of games
1571.18,1572.94," Yeah, but not all right not all games"
1573.02,1579.5, See things there look at look at PC RPGs and compare them to a lot of the you know the traditionally and I don't nowadays
1579.5,1581.74, Those are different because bioware is producing you know
1581.74,1583.3400000000001, It's RPGs for consoles and stuff
1583.5,1588.54, But once upon a time when your choices were Japanese RPGs and if you compare them to PC RPGs
1588.54,1595.1000000000001, They're very different mindset and then we're saying the euro stuff is clearly you know part of the lineage of the the PC RPG
1597.26,1599.26, Nerd
1599.26,1601.26, Yeah
1601.66,1602.6200000000001, Yeah
1602.6999999999998,1604.62," Sorry, I really squeaky chair"
1604.78,1607.7399999999998," Yeah, is that you yeah, if any tweaks man you got to be careful"
1608.06,1611.1, Whenever you're in the swing when you're playing games with people online and someone's in team
1611.1,1613.58, Speak you don't want your chair to squeak everyone's like whoa dude
1615.4199999999998,1617.4199999999998, Deep that squeak was
1618.62,1620.62, Which as you got sitting in that chair
1622.86,1629.4199999999998," So Ryan I want to turn the attention to you for a minute. Oh, you've been sitting quiet. Are you even listening? Huh? He's been young and"
1630.3,1632.3, Are you like in wow and you're just woke up
1632.6999999999998,1634.6999999999998, Are you playing wow on your head still?
1635.34,1640.2199999999998, Right now this minute. Yes. Are you so what are you doing in wow right now like in your head?
1641.8999999999999,1643.8999999999999, Question
1644.78,1646.78," Isn't that all you ever doing well, please?"
1647.1799999999998,1651.7399999999998, You've been on a big wow kit. I've been playing a lot of wow. Yeah
1653.02,1657.58, This last patch they they put in an experience bump
1658.54,1660.54, Oh
1660.54,1662.54, For quests
1662.54,1665.58, They are trying to hustle people to those in game levels
1666.22,1671.8999999999999, Is that like when they add like extra potency to the crack to try to bring more in or
1672.6999999999998,1676.46," Bring more cash in we don't know about that here Robert. Oh, okay"
1677.6599999999999,1679.6599999999999, That we do
1681.5,1684.86, I think we make money around here game magazines come on
1688.1399999999999,1692.86," Well, um, they've blizzard has said you know more more than once that"
1693.6599999999999,1697.8999999999999, The original games content is kind of like obsolete now with the expansion out
1698.62,1704.3799999999999, And I think they this this experience bump is like it's there to just kind of get people to that as quickly as possible
1704.86,1711.8999999999999," Right, yeah, I think they just yeah, they just want to get you out of the area that everybody's done to death now right right"
1713.02,1714.3, And so
1714.3,1716.3, My dude was level 49
1717.26,1719.98, Before the weekend now he's 55
1719.98,1727.02," Yeah, but here's my concern with you you're all wrapped up in this game now and there's like like 800 new PC games"
1727.8999999999999,1729.8999999999999, And you're like are you not playing those?
1730.3,1732.3, Huh? I'm asking this
1732.3,1734.3, I'm saying that
1734.3,1736.3, I mean no Jeff
1736.3,1738.3, You already said that last week
1738.3,1742.86, Every week this is gonna be a why did I hire Ryan talk to him a pocket?
1743.82,1745.6599999999999," Hey, I have to out"
1745.6599999999999,1751.74, I blame I blame you I blame you. Why doesn't even count is like because it's like everyone's list of now playing you know
1751.74,1753.74, I mean what it it's it's
1753.74,1756.3799999999999, It's not yours. It's so ubiquitous that it's like not even
1757.4199999999998,1759.4199999999998, It's still a list at least
1759.4199999999998,1764.06," Well, I'm I'm gonna be after this podcast for word a few of us here are doing legendary threat"
1764.06,1768.2199999999998, I'm gonna be completely outed once again as not having played this game
1768.38,1772.3," We're crap, hoes are but but I got to say that like these MMOs"
1773.42,1778.22, You know not only are they just time sinks in general for like everything else you would want to do with your life
1778.54,1781.58, That's not gaming but they're just a complete sink as far as
1782.54,1788.3, Or they're just a complete block as far as playing anything else like has been very liberating for me for the past
1789.1000000000001,1794.22," Few weeks to not play wow because it's like no, wow. There's other games at there. I forgot"
1794.94,1797.02, You know it's a real it's a real problem with them
1797.02,1799.02, I was I think because
1799.02,1801.42, If there's games out there that like I'm playing for work
1802.3799999999999,1808.06, There are particularly great. I'm actually resenting them because they're not wow. I'm thinking like I could be laughing
1809.1,1811.1, I could be you know
1811.1,1813.5, Getting through this next zone in the outland right now
1814.3,1819.82," So I I'm sort of resenting that I'm not doing wow, but now that there's actually great games out that I can play"
1819.82,1822.54, I'm relieved that I'm I'm not
1823.18,1830.46, Getting that feeling while I'm playing them and playing the witcher and actually able to enjoy the witcher in fact that mark my entire experience of oblivion was
1830.86,1835.1," Which I which I acknowledge was great, but but the whole time I was playing oblivion"
1835.1,1838.62, I felt like I was playing single player wow and it was making me miss wow
1839.8999999999999,1841.8999999999999," It's kind of play wow single player anyway, though"
1842.62,1845.18," Yeah, you don't really group up you admitted that before"
1845.6599999999999,1849.42, That's how I don't know that's because I don't like people. I've been able to play a bunch of the new people
1849.5,1855.5," I consider myself still way into wow. Yeah, I'm reading and stuff and doing all the onion game content and they think they designed it well enough"
1856.38,1862.22, That you don't have to sink your life into it because I'm doing it maybe twice or three times a week
1862.7,1865.9," But I'm still playing I still got to play a table arasah, so I still want playing hellgate"
1866.54,1871.26," It's a bit I play that armor getting Empire's game. Oh, yeah, but isn't it frustrating"
1871.26,1874.22, Counsel games even because it's you know how you able to
1875.18,1880.94, We're getting all the land and what is that horrible sound? I know I don't look at you trying to figure out what I hear nothing everybody stop
1882.6200000000001,1885.82," Here people take it off office ambience. Yeah, okay, damn them"
1886.14,1889.34, But isn't it ever frustrating to play games like that
1889.74,1898.54, These big open ended games where you just go on and you play a little bit like and you get just a taste of it and it never ends like you never get any sort of
1899.82,1901.02, It's about the journey
1901.02,1903.02, It's about the journey
1903.5,1904.86, I had about the ending
1904.86,1908.3799999999999, I'd rather have like I'd rather play like a five hour long game with an ending
1908.7,1912.94, Well the reason I'm playing wow was very different from the reason I would be playing like mass effect because I'm
1912.94,1914.94," Yeah, playing that for sure"
1915.58,1920.3799999999999, It's just like there's these kind of collaborative community that we hear the sounding there it is again
1920.62,1923.42," It sounds breathy. Yeah, it's like a ghost in here"
1924.1399999999999,1926.1399999999999, Ryan you were just messing with your headset
1928.06,1930.06," Oh, that was it does it"
1931.74,1933.74, No whoa this freaky
1934.3799999999999,1936.3799999999999, I don't
1936.3799999999999,1938.3799999999999, Podcast room
1942.94,1945.9," Yeah, wow we are we are recording this sober by the way"
1947.1,1950.46, Me not a standard like a past minute to do you hear that?
1951.42,1953.42, I swear there's someone in here with us
1954.54,1956.54," Well anyway, I"
1956.86,1962.3799999999999," A few games I plan on checking out in the near future such as sim city societies, okay?"
1963.18,1967.58," It's not a PC game, but I'm eager to jump into Super Mario Galaxy. Okay"
1968.54,1974.3," Those are the two big ones on my list right now. Did sim city societies? It's a doubt now. Yep, it is"
1974.86,1978.3," Damn it. Yeah, he sent us some copies got damn it. I got my copy"
1979.02,1983.82," Oh, yeah, great wait a hold it so you have it and you're not playing it. I'm planning on it"
1983.82,1985.02, I'm writing this video
1985.02,1991.82," Robert played it. I won't work on my PC it crashes it. Oh, man. Yeah, so"
1992.78,1995.74," Get a new PC yeah, just give it to me. Okay"
1996.3,2001.74," I get that PC yeah, yeah, I get shit for for going off long time, but I also happen to play games"
2002.06,2004.06, So
2006.22,2010.3799999999999, I'm playing games a play game except I don't I haven't played many PC games
2010.3799999999999,2012.3799999999999, I'm nearly done with Mario Galaxy
2012.5400000000002,2016.94," Really Mario Galaxy there aren't multiple Galaxy. Oh, there are there are though"
2016.94,2020.46, That's the Galaxy I'm a game about that to see irony. I got to get away and
2021.74,2027.3400000000001, Actually in last night I played rock band with my friends for about four hours and that was fucking amazing
2027.5,2030.3000000000002, What I instrument were you playing we were cycling through everything
2031.42,2037.5, Yeah rotation rotation that's interesting that you played that with friends because I would one concern I had was it seeing how
2037.9,2043.34, All the coverage for this game is coming out of you know groups of of people who write about games
2043.66,2049.1," Yeah, I don't use that this is the pause right there was me not wanting to say games journalist because I don't really believe there's such a thing"
2049.1,2054.7," I'll put professional enthusiasm it's professional enthusiasm. Yeah, so and and what we do is professional enthusiasm"
2055.66,2059.02, So but among these groups you have these these ready built
2059.9,2064.54, You know like bands you know like oh there's at least four people who are gonna want to and you can get together
2064.54,2069.74," Because you can play games in your days, you know, it's part of the natural work day and you could do it. And I was wondering like"
2070.3,2073.82, Like you know me there's no way if I bought that all that Fisher price shit
2073.82,2078.14," I'm never gonna assemble a dual on January at my house. Yeah, why? Because it likes you"
2078.86,2083.9," Well, no if people come over we're not gonna be playing. I don't know no let's come over and play you can"
2083.9,2086.14," Yeah, I don't know I don't know"
2086.14,2092.46, I don't know I was just I want to come out my place and just being the hub for a lot of socialization in general
2092.54,2098.78," Yeah, so it's good. It's like a good a good game for that. I also have friends who are pretty into music games like"
2098.94,2102.54, Who are really excited to play that game and I'm married in my wife played
2102.94,2104.94, So we actually had five people and
2106.54,2111.58," And it was way cooler than you're in the end using your life with you. Yeah, wow, it's cool"
2111.82,2118.94, We actually used to be in bands together when we were younger like real bands what did she play she plays his drums and guitar nice female drummer
2119.34,2121.34, She hot
2121.42,2124.6200000000003, I'm legally qualified to say yes mega hot
2126.1400000000003,2128.1400000000003, Mega mega hot
2128.1400000000003,2133.98," Someone singing to you that's the one instrument. Yeah, no we had singing. It was fun like I love karaoke"
2133.98,2140.06, Like how does it how does the game judge the singing in rock band? It uses that same karaoke revolution
2140.46,2142.46, Pitch detection just a pitch you can also
2143.42,2148.46," Yeah, you don't have to be singing anyone you don't have to be and we just kept that we just kept the vocal"
2148.54,2151.02," No, I think the thing is about this games"
2151.02,2156.06, I don't think that it's meant to be played for points at all like rock band is like the opposite of guitar hero
2156.3,2163.02, guitar heroes like very video gamey very like get the high school rock bands about having a virtual musical experience
2163.02,2168.46," You know, and so we just kept the the vocals on you know on easy the whole time so we'd never"
2168.86,2173.1, You know be downgraded for somebody having fun with it because it's not like a fire
2173.3399999999997,2175.3399999999997, You know
2175.3399999999997,2182.48, You can but you would leave along in San Francisco can the that the guy who's got like the tambourine to unison cool in the harmonica and the cordie and the
2182.48,2184.48, Which one
2184.48,2186.48, Who's the one one
2186.48,2187.48, The one with the tambourine
2187.48,2189.48, And you talking about that scene a lot
2190.38,2192.72, But no you could play it by yourself
2192.72,2197.88, I think only the drums would be fun by themselves the drums in another themselves are really
2198.38,2201.2599999999998, Interesting everything else. I think is more fun to play as a group
2201.6200000000003,2206.6200000000003, But I think the other cool thing about it is that they change the hardware of the guitars and it's much more physical
2206.6200000000003,2213.38, So like the actual parts note-wise or easier to play so they're less crazy if you're if you're not that great at it
2213.38,2219.6400000000003, But at the same time they've made they've made it feel much more like actually playing guitar by making the strum bar have more
2219.7400000000002,2223.1800000000003, Give to it to where you really have to jam up and down
2224.1800000000003,2226.94, I don't know it's it's really it's really really well done
2226.94,2231.1800000000003, I actually think it's not a video game. I think I think it's like an example of the kind of thing that can
2231.26,2235.6400000000003," Come out of video games that will be you know related but here in like 15 years, you know"
2235.6400000000003,2240.6400000000003, There'll be stuff like that that no one will think of as video games. It's just got my bundle waiting at home
2240.6400000000003,2246.9," Yeah, I think it's a video game. I think they really all just like I mean the drums is clearly obviously"
2247.98,2251.5400000000004," About getting the rhythm right yeah, aren't they really all rhythm"
2252.34,2256.9," Oh, all of them. Yeah, but I mean we're we are talking about rock music here"
2256.9,2259.1000000000004, Which is pretty much 90% rhythm
2259.2599999999998,2265.7799999999997, But you can sing in the in the game and that's definitely about a melody and pitch and people last night
2265.7799999999997,2267.7," We're doing ridiculous shit, you know"
2267.7,2273.62, We would sing songs and and everyone that I had over those end to singing songs and so we would do songs in different voices
2273.62,2274.62, You know singing like
2275.1,2278.06," Maps by the yeah, yeah, yeah, as in Johnny cash voice"
2278.3399999999997,2283.2999999999997," You know like doing just doing ridiculous stuff like that or adding your own parts to it, you know"
2283.2999999999997,2287.18," Hey, I have a question. Yeah, can you turn the foot pedal off on the drum?"
2287.7,2292.8199999999997," And no, I mean you're even on the easiest one you have to use the foot pedal like sparsely"
2292.8199999999997,2299.74, But you want to use the foot pedal because over time you get you get the coordination that you need to actually like play the drum
2299.74,2306.3799999999997, Probably more than any other instrument that one actually probably it's yeah would require a little bit of skill or maybe what actually
2306.3799999999997,2311.8599999999997, Teachy something as I think it's closest to the real instrument. It's very very very close
2311.8599999999997,2314.1, The only thing missing is a high hat pedal
2314.18,2321.14, I mean when you're playing the expert I'm a drummer so I play all the songs on expert and the parts are the same thing as the drums
2321.14,2321.86, I mean
2321.86,2328.42, Except you're not really getting the same feedback feel from hitting a drum and there's a lot too like finesse when you play the drums
2328.42,2333.86," Not just bashing on trash cans, but so when this first came up shot shonder for to them as a Fisher price"
2334.3399999999997,2342.86," Toys as a drummer do you feel that way? No, I mean I think the drums are very obviously like a low level electronic drum set"
2342.86,2350.7400000000002," That you might buy like guitar center, you know, but but on which you can only play along with songs that the drum kit is playing with you"
2350.7400000000002,2356.7400000000002, So if this were a Fisher price thing you press a button and the lights turn on on each of the drum heads in a given order
2356.7400000000002,2360.58," And it can only play songs, you know, I mean it's like there's no there actually open parts and"
2360.58,2365.98," So if you get there is there there there are moments where if you if you get a sequence of notes, right?"
2365.98,2367.98, You get to make your own fills
2368.06,2373.08, So you you'll you'll get this whole line where you make up your own fill in the song and you get points for that
2373.08,2379.46," Yeah, it's like the version of rocking out or whatever they called it guitar hero and just score you score is your based on"
2379.46,2385.7," Yeah, well, no, I mean the only only score thing you get is if you hit the symbol at the end of your at the end of your role"
2385.7,2391.14, So other everyone else who's playing it was really funny because it would just be like it would sound normal and then all of a sudden
2391.14,2395.58, They'd get to the part to where they could do the role and and they weren't you know drummers
2395.58,2399.2999999999997, So they'd just like go free jazz crazy for five seconds
2401.66,2403.66," And then go back to the song, you know"
2404.1,2409.38, But it was I don't know it was really fun and it felt like I don't know it felt not unlike
2409.98,2413.5, You know getting together with some friends in a garage and playing music
2413.5,2419.8199999999997, There there was something musical about it and it was fun to watch other people play and in a way that it might be fun to watch other people
2419.8199999999997,2424.5, Play I don't think I could bring this in the my house. I would totally play this if I was a bachelor
2424.5,2428.82," But I think this is gonna be if I brought that shit home, we would be like the times I've brought like a"
2429.58,2434.74, Steering wheel home or something for the PC or my and I'm hooking it up on my wife's like in me like are you fucking kidding me
2437.26,2439.26, Her inner friends come on
2439.26,2444.46," That's sad, you know I don't know I think I think the maybe I think that I think that it actually"
2445.06,2449.46, gets the ladies interested not in that sense
2449.46,2460.64, But I mean I've had lots of parties where I've had people over to play games who don't play games ever and they love to play guitar hero
2460.64,2467.2200000000003," Everybody yeah, yeah, I have a good. True house. Yeah, I toy worked that way as well. I toy yeah"
2467.54,2471.38, What's wrong? Do you want to talk about PC games here at the GFW radio podcast?

2538.18,2544.86, Of course I paid no attention to her and I'm focused as ever on the song clear in the fast pull off intro and the FC
2545.14,2547.14, She then starts screaming at me
2547.22,2550.22, So I told her would you mind shutting the fuck up
2551.5,2556.64, Grab my last Paul and pulls her away from me saying you only care about the fucking game
2557.3799999999997,2564.8599999999997, Result my FC on rating blood into the third minute of the song was ruined and what out the guitar was quickly a failed song
2565.3799999999997,2568.62, She then slams the door in my house and she yells she's going home
2569.22,2576.62, What should I do I mean? I don't want a loser but the bitch did ruin a magnificent run in one of the games most insane songs
2578.1,2580.1," Wow, I admire that guy"
2580.3399999999997,2586.3399999999997," He's manning up. You got it. You got a dumpper. Yeah, I think it's for advice. Yeah, I the choice is Claire"
2586.3399999999997,2592.5," Yeah, seriously. She ruined his song. You sound like a pretty serious guitar hero player. What do you need ladies for? Right?"
2592.9,2597.66, It'll it'll need to find a lady who appreciates that kind of air if you get that if you get that perfect FC
2597.66,2599.66, You'll have all the girls you need
2599.66,2603.54, And then she'll be sorry that one who dumped you. They were but I didn't I didn't
2604.2599999999998,2610.46," Imagine that got some where that comes from was that on our form? No, that was on I don't know. It was like I janned forms or something"
2611.58,2617.9, How are you forms do you read I don't read them all I get links from people which is good people will submit lately
2617.9,2623.82, People submit what they want to become a hero the web and that's been pretty good and then I have
2624.9,2626.4, This week
2626.4,2629.7799999999997, We did I mentioned in the past that I have this fake account
2630.3,2633.26, One of one at least one fake account on one of four
2634.1000000000004,2635.3, and
2635.3,2638.36, It's what I'm gonna out one of them because I want people to appreciate
2639.5,2641.5, If just how fun this guy is
2642.9,2651.02, So his name is ideal poster. That's you ideal underscore poster and part of the thing part of the origins of this guy is like
2651.3,2654.7000000000003, There was this long running tradition on one up of just these same in
2654.7,2656.7, Obsainely
2656.7,2658.7, these obsainely
2659.5,2664.02, Just pretentious posts about just dumb dumb stuff and the other thing is that
2664.54,2669.8199999999997," The grammar was a mess of course, but they were just low to a thousand pro-pizzons or like words used in the wrong context"
2669.8199999999997,2675.98," So they were actual words, but they weren't used correctly and so we took that and then also this tradition of like"
2675.98,2682.0, Boulding random shit and I talismizing it and editing your post over and over again and having a sig
2682.0,2685.18," I mean, that's so dumb right you know, so imposed on a say on a forum"
2685.18,2688.26, It says your name on the left and then they sign the damn thing afterward
2688.6,2693.3, With like a tilde whatever so we got all that in there and this guy's name some of his background is
2694.14,2701.9, His name is Fenster may hue. We list his interests on his one up page his forums honor on so steel fingerless gloves
2702.88,2705.88, His avatar is a picture of
2706.6800000000003,2711.6800000000003," Like this like smuck-looking white guy with a ponytail, but like holding a katana"
2712.0,2716.6400000000003," You know, sort of across his face like he's some sort of a shito master and then"
2717.4,2723.28," Where he oh and it's also in one of those like inspirational poster things, you know, and it's a long honor"
2723.28,2728.84, Beneath it and he works at staples in the astro plane and so
2729.84,2734.44, I'm gonna give a few examples of these are some of the the earlier post that we did to give you an idea for the character
2734.44,2737.26, And then all like tell you the one that we just did over the weekend
2737.26,2743.68, We because me and Roy will take turns. We both have the count information and sometimes we'll and then we'll try to out do each other with the most like ridiculous
2743.68,2745.68, Ideal poster post
2745.68,2755.08," A few people would get it, but most people don't most people just of course say does the forms are so in the Internet so like right insane and and ridiculous as it is that nothing"
2755.08,2758.7200000000003, surprises anyone anymore. You just believe that stuff is okay. All right
2764.44,2766.84, And I always imagine that you're my nerd voice for this guy so
2768.12,2773.96, His first post was gaming game free or don't that was the thread title and the don't it's a question mark
2774.68,2778.88, Hello friends and fellow travelers. I'm something of a new to these boards
2779.08,2784.88," This being my first post, but I hope to make a good impression on you to make a few new comrades in the procedure"
2784.88,2789.78, I encroach upon you today with a conundrum of meager yet fast proportions
2790.5,2796.1800000000003, Why is it that we as gamers have commenced to fear true freedom in this our most beloved hobby of gaming?
2796.5,2799.94, Is it the enormity of responsibility we so ferment against?
2800.5800000000004,2805.86, The thought that we may one day be accountable if not indeed accessible for our own enjoyment
2808.1000000000004,2815.6400000000003," Oh, I'm should be raised in the youth and Asia of our gaming freedom instead be fearful for your ability to enjoy games that are this free"
2816.12,2822.6, Will we one day throughout the legend of Zelda the Windwaker in knowing that the land of high-roo shall always be high-roo
2822.6,2824.6, And not a high rule of my own design
2825.24,2828.04, And what then of shadow of the colossal success
2829.04,2834.0, Ask yourself friends. What master chief can be as personable and close to your own heart
2834.0,2841.68, Then a master chief of your own design by speaking of course of a topic which has been focused upon numerous times by the minds of
2841.68,2847.04, Sinkers such as Miyamoto saw himself and perhaps even the likes of those such as Stephen Spielberg
2847.44,2853.8799999999997, Who has now made his commitment to gaming freedom not only known but renowned through his game blocks for the Nintendo
2857.16,2859.68, For the Nintendo brand Wii gaming system
2860.16,2869.9199999999996, They post post and indeed demand a revolution in how we gain a gaming 2.0 not unlike the web 2.0 that enriches our lives right now even as we serve
2870.56,2873.04," Okay, and then the post group that was"
2873.92,2880.08, What did a much covet what if the much-convented game of the year word given out by a multitude of publications
2880.52,2886.2400000000002, Who and how will determine whether or not the game or the civilian if I may so refer to them receives the prize
2887.0,2892.12, Time magazine was bold enough to confer upon me and you the person of the year
2892.2,2901.7599999999998, And who then will be electronic gaming monthly magazine give their game of the year little big planets with a users who make it acclimate
2902.12,2905.12, This is a topic that I perhaps cannot contemplate alone
2907.12,2912.56, That was the kind of shit like we went on and then I'll condense to us because they're long posts and then the next one was
2912.56,2918.7799999999997, Bashito as manifest games and again like I get all these words are all used in the wrong way and at the point right that
2919.1400000000003,2923.5400000000004, The responses like to that first one he just read people like believe that that was a real good
2923.5400000000004,2928.38, There's a serious debate people arguing that like no there's still room for games that tell you a story the
2928.38,2933.38, The story they want to tell and did anyone like point out that like every other word was used incorrectly no
2933.9,2937.6200000000003, What they always do is point out like you stop trying to sound so smart
2938.86,2941.46," No, but I mean because they get the sense they're like okay"
2941.46,2946.3, This is annoying but not like okay no you're not using any word
2946.3,2949.1200000000003, And he's like reasonable way
2950.5,2956.2200000000003, So then the next one the Bashito as manifest games he it goes sort of like
2957.94,2959.94, Why don't more vaulted
2959.94,2965.54, Developers in the quote unquote Western world take hints from the age this wisdom past us from the peoples of the East
2965.54,2970.42, I'm saying for instance the code of Bashito which could be of great help in designing games
2970.42,2976.02, I will demonstrate for the uninitiate the Netherlands as seen in Pikmin to devote with
2976.3,2979.26, To the aid of others lesser and stature than oneself
2980.38,2982.86, Honor and glory who can claim honor
2983.34,2989.2200000000003, Then the one that rescues the world from certain destruction what glory is there inspiring a weapon and enemy rather than
2989.3,2993.5, Competing and swordplay with that said enemy hence the final fantasy series
2995.02,2996.0600000000004, Then a
2996.0600000000004,3005.54, Filiopiety presents Shenmue it says it's one's father who won seeks to avenge one's grandmother with whom one lives and one's society with whom he is at peace
3006.86,3008.86, So
3008.86,3013.7000000000003, On and on that went so the final one what we did this weekend is there's this awesome
3014.5800000000004,3018.5, Video and if you're listening you should pause right now and go to YouTube and search for
3019.2200000000003,3024.1200000000003, Dragon Quest Jokesster and it's the television commercial for that or you can just go to the GFW thread
3024.1200000000003,3029.0600000000004, We have links in it in there and if everyone in here but Robert seen it and it's kind of weird because
3029.94,3031.94, There's this kid
3031.94,3035.2200000000003, He's on a beach and he's trying to set a trap for a monster and he's got this like
3035.2200000000003,3041.4, Like demon behind him. He's like pop-locking doing like the body wave and he's always just like right behind this kid
3041.4,3046.32, You know just like little close to him and then he's like I could cast a spell and the kids like
3046.86,3050.98, Pike down something and he's I don't think your space can work on this
3053.2200000000003,3061.1, There's something weird about the kid like he doesn't he doesn't have Downson or something right? I mean there's some speech and pediment or it could be that he was like maybe it's trying to
3061.94,3067.58, Per convey that fact that he's scared because there's this giant monster that even his spells aren't good enough to catch
3067.58,3073.54, So with that knowing that that has sort of been making around some people have been talking about it the post appears
3074.42,3075.42, um
3075.42,3077.42, And it starts off with
3078.42,3082.42, Recently I participate in the filming of commercial for Dragon Quest Jokesster
3082.62,3086.02, Here's a try of a travel log for the one-up.com gamer boards
3086.42,3091.66, My co-actor in acting coach Keith rubbed my back with his knee while I prepared to deliver my line
3092.14,3097.86," The commercial story is that he can cast the spell, but I request him that no it's spell will not work"
3097.86,3103.34, I tell my message to Keith demon Keith that I don't think his spells gonna work on this one
3103.9,3109.18," Keith appeared for a Lord, but anticipatory for what come next a shadow of monster in distance"
3109.5,3112.5, Have any of you born witness to my commercial on TV
3112.9,3121.62, So that got it started people were like mad people were upset there like why are you pimping you know your commercial
3122.62,3127.16," I really have viral marketer right and okay, so fall up was like you know"
3127.16,3134.58, I feel I should form those of you not exalting my achievement that in fact my line was not produced as a litre originally written as it was first
3134.58,3138.7," I'm not sure a spell will work on that one, but I claim don't appreciate"
3139.22,3144.54, Like into a true connoisseur of the acted word and said I don't think a spell should work on this one
3146.22,3152.6," To be honest, there's a flood to begin with because I feel the director would call upon me to perhaps cast a true spell or that"
3153.8799999999997,3156.5, Or that Keith who is a wicked would curse me somehow
3157.2599999999998,3161.5, Through for my fear was born a line that the director called acceptable
3162.22,3169.06," My pay for this action was a copy of Dragon Quest jokester and Keith's demon ears, which I would like to put on eBay"
3169.3,3173.46, Can a moderator at the site please make a poll on the top describing Keith's years
3174.58,3176.58, How much I shouldn't choir for them on eBay
3178.38,3183.58, Meanwhile like every time it ends we're signing it with like Fenster may hue 2007
3183.58,3189.82, I don't think a spell's gonna work on this one and then a little picture for a little steal from the commercial every time
3191.58,3193.58, So then next I told them
3194.22,3196.22, That okay in addition
3196.22,3198.38, This is Rallow let's try to read this in a normal voice
3199.02,3204.7, In addition and as to once my fearful retort the director's placed tennis ball upon a 30 foot rod
3204.7,3209.02, And it is this which we were told to direct our gaze as 30 feet is the height of the monster
3209.26,3212.94, The rod head once come a crashing down thus far making a terrible noise
3212.94,3219.66, And never after I was unable to regain my composure however the director believed that my fear was the fear of the boy on the island
3219.66,3225.5, Who is attempting an earnest to seize the 30 foot monster all the while I did recite the litany against fear
3225.5,3227.5, Is it appeared in the works of Frank Herbert?
3231.5,3236.8199999999997," Okay, then finally what went on to say like hey if you're a developer and you're reading this"
3237.18,3242.1," You know, I'm looking for I'm always eager to do future work, you know, and then I've included a headshot"
3243.2999999999997,3249.42, This blasted image from the YouTube one turned to like 2000 by something and then it was like a paint and
3249.42,3255.02," MS paint signature put on its safe fencer may you and then I also told people in it that like oh, yeah"
3255.34,3261.14, I don't mind once making this into a desktop wallpaper which can be enabled via right click on windows PCs
3261.78,3263.78, And some people took it
3263.78,3265.58, She's shocked and there of it as their desktop
3268.2200000000003,3274.06, So asking to have a recid so how many people got it like how many get people got the joke at that point?
3274.06,3277.66, Maybe like two or three and this was after we had a bunch
3278.22,3284.3799999999997, Did another one where we broke down the significance of all the boss names in in metal gear for so
3284.62,3287.18, That's coming out. You know how they're always ridiculous
3287.5,3291.64, It's like you know ravenous raven or something they might as well just be like hungry hippo or some
3292.94,3295.5, It's like for the names their name after auto pops or something
3296.8999999999996,3303.64," But so we tried to say how that was like no, let's just knowing nothing but their names let's speculate on like how you know"
3303.64,3308.2799999999997, What their MO is and you know how to fight and who they who they're related to and all the shit and broke it down
3309.44,3313.3599999999997, The thing is it is so close to reality. I mean these could have been real post
3313.3599999999997,3318.8799999999997, I just like first I mean set it on the stopping all of the all of the mannerisms of stuff are sort of
3319.48,3321.7999999999997, copies of things that we've seen
3322.44,3326.72, One way shape form you know on internet boards rolled up into one
3326.72,3328.72, Ideal post
3331.2799999999997,3335.48, So I'm gonna retire ideal poster now or now that he's been out there
3335.48,3338.3199999999997, We'll be fun to just keep we'll maybe do one more and see what happens
3338.3199999999997,3343.24, But see if people like our people are gonna be on the show. I'll do it more people like playing along with you
3343.24,3346.6," Yeah, and then that's even worse when they try to play along with it, and it's so bad"
3347.3599999999997,3350.7799999999997," Yeah, so I'm going to a routhy online now a little bit yeah"
3350.7799999999997,3355.3999999999996," People know that a long time because yeah, if you're in a game and you're trying to do something immediately everyone"
3355.96,3362.08," Starts talking about G of W radio or trying to go along with it, but in a horrible ridiculous way that makes it"
3362.36,3364.36, Is asked or price of fame
3364.36,3366.36, It's dreadful now
3366.36,3368.36, So so it's dreadful being famous
3370.6,3378.6800000000003, And I and like let's clarify I'm being for seizures. There's no fame involved. I put it before when the fame of
3379.48,3385.0, Of being someone that writes about video games for living is like orders of magnitude below that of like someone writes comic books or something
3385.0,3389.16, And you don't you don't see someone like oh shit that dude wrote a comic book
3390.2,3392.2, Right can I talk you
3392.2,3395.7799999999997, What so why did you make rhymes on quiet getting maddies like do that
3396.96,3399.96, Approach so many comic comic book writers that
3400.8399999999997,3404.7999999999997, It's a convention convention. How do you spot a comic book writer?
3405.6000000000004,3407.6000000000004, I
3409.1200000000003,3414.0600000000004," Well, we've all had the all seen famous people and and you've been tempted to ever say anything to them"
3414.0600000000004,3420.42, I met Tony Hawk once really I met Elvis Costello coming up out of art like last year really
3420.42,3423.1600000000003," Yeah, did you say anything to him? I gave you a CD of my band"
3423.1600000000003,3426.8, We came back from from E3 last year Robert and
3427.6800000000003,3429.6800000000003, Who was on her plane with us?
3430.32,3432.32, Was that the Jesse Jesse Jensen?
3432.32,3437.84," Yeah, and people and there was so many childhood like sell them some education system for"
3438.4,3441.44, Like municipalities or something like he was the mayor of a town
3441.44,3446.56, I was really weird I overheard a huge pitch that they were given them for some computer thing
3447.2000000000003,3449.84," Wow, yeah fly in Southwest right?"
3449.84,3454.6400000000003," Yeah, Southwest. Yeah, that means he was there is no coach. It's all coach. Yeah, yeah, yeah"
3455.2000000000003,3458.88, So former presidential candidates writing right in Southwest. There's an endorsement
3458.88,3465.08," You know you know Will is see he was sitting behind MC Hammer on a flight down to LA. Oh, God. Yeah, that would have been interesting"
3465.08,3470.2400000000002, I think that would be more interesting than or like Gary Coleman gonna bring him up in line of the catch call thing
3470.96,3473.96, He's always pissed off and upset about something
3474.6800000000003,3476.6800000000003, I saw Gary Coleman E3
3476.6800000000003,3488.48, He's always been a more human setting because he was in line in front of me at the little you know cafeteria thing and he was bitching about the
3488.48,3490.48, Cost of something
3492.28,3495.28," It was kind of what yeah, he was like the Sanchez for 50"
3496.12,3498.12, 45 for the sandwich
3500.12,3502.12, The E3 just to get free shit
3502.12,3508.32, You know come on child stars and sandwich shops speaking of which there's a member of the movie called Mac and me
3508.32,3509.2, Is a fake ass
3509.2,3517.92," He was at the McDonald's movie Donald's one. Yeah, yeah, there's the kid in the wheelchair was was the star in my friend went to"
3518.48,3521.8, High school and palm desert and that kid went to a school and he
3522.56,3531.4," Went to the local sandwich shops like port of subs or something, you know and he brought him in a picture of frame picture of him with a signature on it and he"
3531.4,3537.36, The they hung it up form and he'd always come in and just stare at it and like make sure and see if people recognize them
3537.36,3540.4," Yeah, yeah, or anything stuff. You know like see if anyone"
3541.04,3547.04," Port of subs that be me like walking around with a cop the FW like no, but I'll everywhere"
3547.04,3550.0," Like to my my photo. Oh, is that me"
3552.12,3560.32, I went to when I was a boy I went to to temple to a synagogue with the first drummer from the parchage family
3560.32,3562.32," You guys might all be too young for this, but"
3562.64,3565.12, At you guys know the parchage family
3565.12,3571.0," Yes, but I know they went through multiple drugs. They had the the brunette Jewish looking drummer"
3571.0,3574.2799999999997, Which was the kid I know and then somewhere in like season two
3574.28,3576.28, They subna mad for this area in blonde
3577.76,3582.26," No, maybe the damage maybe it was a little they got some hate mail or something"
3582.6800000000003,3584.6800000000003, What's with the kid drummer you got there?
3584.6800000000003,3587.48," I don't know what happened, but they subna mad"
3587.48,3591.2400000000002, But anyway the point is that we would be sitting there in Hebrew school and
3592.2000000000003,3596.5400000000004, You know whatever. We're trying to learn Hebrew and this kid who was on the parchage family
3596.5400000000004,3602.1800000000003," You sit there and like be doing like drum rhythms, you know on the on the table and stuff"
3602.18,3607.66," Yeah, like yeah, we know you're on the show dude for one and two you're not even playing the fucking drums on the show"
3607.8199999999997,3611.02, That's bad. We know every drummer. I knew in high school
3611.18,3615.1, There's the whole like tradition of pantheon mining shit so that someone asks you what you're doing
3615.1,3617.94, You know what's when you're like you want someone to like start the conversation
3617.94,3624.66, But you wanted to be about you so like this one kid would sit there and he played drums and he would be like you know pretending pantheon
3624.66,3627.8799999999997, Do it well actually tapping his feet out like his double-sided bass drums
3627.8799999999997,3628.8799999999997, You know on the ground and like
3628.88,3632.38, That's like doing spins and patching like invisible sticks
3632.92,3636.84, Reaching over your desk like it's a hi-hat or some extra like he's got this big cage
3636.84,3641.54, You know and he's just like rocking everyone's thing and then like the surfers to they'd go down
3641.54,3647.4, The halls like act in like they're cutting back and shit like you mean so that you would go acknowledge that they were a surfer
3647.4,3649.4," Yeah, you're like"
3653.0,3655.0, Great for surfers king
3655.52,3660.2," Yeah, I was always just hoping someone would come up and be like, wow, do you play video games?"
3660.2,3662.2, You go down like
3664.2,3666.2, Awesome
3666.64,3672.38, That's what you know I think I'm guilty that we're like at least I brought an intent of power to school elementary school
3672.92,3677.36, Showed someone code you want to get to mind this world. I'm talking about like the newspaper one the first came out
3677.36,3680.24, Oh the way what was it called the fun club or something?
3680.24,3689.08, Tendou fun club which was advertised within Mike Tyson's punch out remember there was a there was a one at one of the little corner talks that you'd get from
3689.72,3691.72," Yeah, it was like"
3691.72,3693.72, Fun club the day Mac
3693.72,3696.08, What happened in the Nintendo fun club it became Nintendo power?
3696.7999999999997,3698.3199999999997," Oh, yeah"
3698.3199999999997,3704.9799999999996," But I wasn't as close as you thought yeah, yeah, I'm picturing sort of like I'd you will like child molesting clown sort of thing"
3704.98,3708.34," Well, there there's a time"
3708.34,3713.6, Different Nintendo that's dragging warrior jokes. There's the devil thing
3713.6,3718.54, Nintendo Nintendo spokesman at the time was kind of I don't know he was kind of the Peter Moore of his day
3718.54,3720.54, But he kind of had that
3720.54,3723.1, He's the president of the Nintendo fun club kids
3724.78,3728.7400000000002, She's trying out this like corporate clown that's more like a clear uncle-merf
3729.42,3731.42, You know the hey kids
3735.54,3742.34," We went down some weird zoos here. Oh, yeah, not much to say about area 51 other than that"
3742.98,3747.66, You know it was you say that like we were always supposed to talk about what we were gonna come back to it
3747.66,3752.02, We were planning on this this was part of our plan Robert you know we're gonna talk about area 51
3752.02,3755.02," Okay, I just don't know the idea and yep, yes"
3756.42,3758.42," What was I saying about area 51? Oh, okay?"
3758.78,3763.22, The interesting thing about it before you know when it was in the preview stages and stuff was that okay
3763.22,3767.8599999999997, Harvey Smith is attached to it and he's you know associated with this X2 and and stuff
3769.06,3771.62, And that it was gonna take this political
3772.2999999999997,3778.8599999999997," Sort of angle and grafted onto its sci-fi story. So, you know rather than just hey, you're not just another space marine shooting just random ship"
3778.8599999999997,3784.2999999999997, But there's going to be you know like ob-grave is mentioned in here or they're going to be some
3785.18,3792.14, You know political there's gonna be political commentary you know on on America's position in the world right now and then you get this game and
3793.2999999999997,3797.98," It's very much to me like most of the time on a planet. I'm thinking like hey, this will probably be more fun with the light gun"
3798.4599999999996,3803.02, Which isn't really ironic because there if you do one was originally a light gun franchise right
3803.7799999999997,3808.7, What it's like now it's like but now instead that game where there's like a bunch of
3809.66,3814.18," Mocap actors, you know, prancing around and bus it as Halloween costumes"
3814.74,3821.06," Now like you take that more or less right and you give it this insane budget, but then you try to start talk about ob-grave"
3823.22,3825.22, Same time I think that sounds amazing
3826.58,3832.8799999999997," I'd be the ultimate game that's like performance sorry, and I don't know I mean I have to read the rest of it"
3832.8799999999997,3833.3799999999997, I know
3833.3799999999997,3838.66, Clip Thompson that wired and I'm really interested in reading when he wrote you know put up a story today sort of about you know
3838.66,3844.02," That I thought from what I gathered from the headline you think says a bull, you know, step in game narrative and stuff"
3844.02,3851.72," And for me, you know, it's kind of awkward because whenever you take a serious a very real problem with people and you know"
3851.8399999999997,3856.98, Politics and society whatever the case may be and you graphed on these like supernatural explanations
3857.54,3858.54, Kind of like
3858.74,3863.3799999999997, Just cheap in everything it's like in you know Marvel comics we talked about the ultimate before in the second phase
3863.3799999999997,3867.9199999999996, They had this story arc where there's these shapeshifting aliens called the scroll and they come in and it turns out
3868.3599999999997,3872.3199999999997, That they were actually the Nazis all the upper echelons of Nazi Germany
3872.3199999999997,3875.9599999999996, They were scrolls and for me. I was like this is dumb. It's like okay
3875.9599999999996,3881.2999999999997," You have yes, we we have to deal with the fact that people do these things that these you know that these things happen and and"
3881.72,3886.9599999999996, The real interesting answers are in the wise and in the house when when soon as you bring in the slight was aliens bro
3888.16,3891.7599999999998, Comic book this wasn't like a textbook right that I mean we're talking
3891.7599999999998,3893.7599999999998, I mean hopefully there's not kids any going
3895.52,3899.64," Right, but the thing is is for it to be like a really interesting I mean look"
3899.64,3904.8399999999997, I mean if you're gonna say like oh this is a game that tells an interesting story that that deals with you know
3905.24,3909.08, American politics is stuff at the time and you're gonna compare it to like a TV show like you like
3909.08,3915.64," Battle Star Galactica for example does the same thing and it is in a science fiction framework, but it's not like whereas here. It's kind of like"
3917.0,3919.88, It's it's more subtle so the difference between without spoiling
3919.88,3925.52, You know the the battle start Galactica thing where I guess I can't even talk about it without because that phase in in
3925.52,3928.72, Balsar Galactica's basically all spoiler real
3929.08,3933.7599999999998, But they do something different what they do in area 51 is basically say well all the you know
3933.76,3940.28, Guantanamo Bay and you know all the the torturing and stuff is American that's basically just they want to make their own super soldiers
3940.28,3944.88, And they're they're gonna do this by splicing aliens boars and stuff into into people
3944.88,3948.4, But they don't want to start testing on on the good soldiers so they're gonna use bombs and
3948.76,3954.0400000000004, P whoever we just happen to have in our prisons and stuff and the gamers and do it on them you know and it's like
3954.6400000000003,3958.48," It's kind of cool, but it isn't really going anywhere and the problem is that this"
3959.32,3962.76, This is only there in little bits and pieces in between
3963.7200000000003,3969.34, The action of playing the game which which like for the most part consists of being on rails and just shooting a turret
3969.34,3973.0800000000004, It's stuff and everyone you know exploding barrels everywhere and every time there's a barrel
3973.0800000000004,3978.96, I really want's gonna take cover behind it to the extent where it's so ridiculous that there's this there's if there's snipers in a section
3979.32,3982.84," In there up on some highest bridge or something, you know and normally a sniper like oh"
3982.84,3988.1600000000003, They're gonna spend some time getting up there and they're gonna lay there and wait around and then they're gonna wait for the you know
3988.16,3991.3599999999997," The patients have a sniper, but these these dudes brought like"
3991.72,3997.1, Explodable barrels on their backs on the height in the middle. They said it down and then they lay down
3997.1,3999.1, This is my blind
3999.1,4001.1, This is gonna be my blind
4001.1,4003.1, I hope they don't shoot it
4005.1,4010.12, You never know and then not just like you know whatever because it's fun to blow shit up that's fine
4010.12,4015.08, But the game though is so it's kind of like a model for how shooters
4015.64,4021.7, Or how it even like mediocre shooters were made six years ago or so where every little thing is just completely
4021.86,4023.36, You know here's another example
4023.36,4028.88, There's this tunnel and these guys are coming out of it and it's an infinite spawn and they're coming out by that by the pairs
4028.88,4035.4, And you have a turret and of course they don't they start coming out of the turret in your line of fire once you touch the turret
4035.4,4039.2799999999997, And then when they do you can just hold the gun there and just hold the fire button down
4039.2799999999997,4042.68, You don't have to move it because they'll just keep walking out into it and they keep doing it and doing it
4042.68,4045.44, So you know I've a screenshot I showed Ryan and in this game
4046.08,4050.06, Could be a PC bug whatever when you kill someone their gun just floats there in the air for you to pick up
4050.06,4054.48," And I had it look like the armory in the matrix, you know when you when they down low when they go"
4054.48,4060.8999999999996," Yeah, it's a blank world and there's just like every gun in existence for them to pick through to bring with them into the matrix"
4060.8999999999996,4063.7, It's looking like that and the guys are still coming
4063.7,4070.3599999999997, It's like okay something and then that's when I noticed the guy is yelling at me like go down there and put C4 in the pipe to stop them coming out
4070.36,4075.04, And meanwhile these stop um the arm is not aliens or something where it's like okay
4075.04,4079.04, There's just some kind of like crusty factory in there spitting out these aliens
4079.04,4081.04, But they're their humans with guns
4081.04,4086.0," I don't know why they're in this tunnel why they're coming out of the tunnel like this, but they're looking for color duty for"
4091.0,4093.6400000000003, So the guys yelling go put this to see four
4093.6400000000003,4097.88, Then you look and there's like okay sure enough at the base of the bridge that they're coming out on onto you
4097.88,4102.52," There's a flashing thing so you run down there and then you press the button, but in this game"
4102.8,4106.16, You don't press the button on the glowing icon to do anything yourself
4106.16,4110.06, But to tell your squad this is its notion of like oh you're in command of a squad right?
4110.06,4115.28, Mm-hmm and you basically press the use button on these things and then the same guy who is just yelling at you
4115.28,4120.2, You got to get down there and put C4 then you get down there by his order and press the button and you go
4120.4400000000005,4122.4400000000005," Hey, man you gotta get down here put C4"
4123.0,4129.599999999999, The same dude comes down and he goes get back on the turret and then you go back on the turret and she wore guys coming out
4131.919999999999,4138.5199999999995," It's just like what is going on you know, I mean it's loaded with invisible walls like you look is something and it's like"
4139.5199999999995,4144.4, It's not even a matter of they're didn't they're just you know a lot of his developers will have to find ways to wall you in because
4144.4,4148.12, They don't want you going just only so much the map that's actually modeled. They don't want you going outside of it
4148.12,4152.68," Yeah, it'll be a route to a place that is in the playing field right where you're going"
4152.68,4155.8," But it's like a rock that's like three inches high, but you can't jump over it"
4155.8,4160.88, Even though you already been jumping over this and you know other things and it's just it's just so random and arbitrary
4160.88,4165.84," Yeah, and and and the other piece about this game this is this is my favorite part is that"
4166.4,4170.48, You're planning you get the sense like every time I turn around there's an enemy behind me or something
4170.48,4176.36, Where the hell these dudes coming from so I start playing we're like I walk with my back to a wall and go up into a corner
4176.36,4180.679999999999, So that you know I'm looking out from a corner that way I have no blind spot and sure enough
4180.679999999999,4183.28, You they just start appearing in the world in front of you
4184.4,4190.12," And it's again, it's not part of the story like they're teleporting either and either not aliens or yeah or even if they are aliens"
4190.12,4194.12, They're they're supposed to be caught and instead of even like modeling like a hole in the wall that they call for
4194.12,4196.839999999999, There's something you just seem appear in this junk. Yes way to start
4198.12,4203.24," Falling out coming into existence like here's what had the emergence holes at least right. Yeah, they didn't even have like"
4203.24,4208.599999999999, There's no you know that I showed Sean the specific part and we're like hey all they had to do is have them come from behind here
4208.599999999999,4211.08, And you're like or just like put a little hole in the wall
4211.08,4216.44, I have to come there that looks like that really sounds like something that they had to implement at the last minute when it was like
4216.44,4219.44," Yeah, you're gonna have to be done with that by Christmas"
4222.679999999999,4225.719999999999," Yeah, you're not gonna have time for a merchant hole"
4226.52,4228.52," Sorry, sorry buddy"
4228.52,4235.320000000001," You know I haven't played this game, but I actually wrote extensively about it beforehand and talked to you Harvey Smith a lot"
4235.320000000001,4239.64," Yeah, it is so weird to hear me describing this now in like conversations"
4239.64,4241.240000000001, It really seems like a
4241.240000000001,4245.64, Situation though where you've got probably a team with good town and people
4245.96,4253.64, But then they have this fucking ridiculous franchise thing that they got to make you know area 51 is if that's a valuable name like
4253.88,4258.52," Oh, we've got area 51 we better make a game around that like instead of just saying hey"
4258.52,4263.56, Why don't you guys make a cool game that you want to make but is people remember that like I remember man
4263.56,4268.200000000001," I think we saw you know, I played that yeah right down the street make a like on shooter for we"
4268.200000000001,4272.76, You know like what why bother making like a next gen like first person shooter?
4272.76,4278.76," That's just it's weird, but yeah, it is super mass market everything. It's clear that like you know"
4279.400000000001,4286.04, You do this is exactly there's never any moment where you even slightly confused is the what you maybe maybe for those folks
4286.04,4290.6," It'll be a cool game it might be yeah, maybe for if you if that's the thing if you're like hey"
4291.4800000000005,4296.68, You remember vaguely when you had half a bottle of tequila and you played this game at the bar
4297.8,4299.8," Like you can bring back some of those memories, right?"
4300.4400000000005,4304.280000000001, If you happen to find yourself in the video game I love Walmart
4304.76,4306.76, Please
4309.72,4311.72, Oh
4312.12,4314.12, Touch the game for a second
4317.8,4319.8, Baryt I mean there's so much out right now
4319.8,4324.52," Yeah, it's what they were about to wait a couple of times and I was I was really into this idea of"
4325.24,4331.72, Even though it was alien invasion at least trying to make a a word game that had some real connection to the real world
4331.72,4332.92, Those are the
4332.92,4337.08, Points where that was here. You're like this is cool like you're in the suburbis or something and you're like oh
4337.08,4340.68, I mean a trailer park or like I'm like again. I mean some you know
4341.24,4343.16," Track home area. Yeah, you're like this is cool"
4343.32,4345.32, But instead of doing anything with it
4345.32,4349.32, It just becomes another maze and there are many guns in people's second store
