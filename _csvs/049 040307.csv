239.64000000000001,244.20000000000002, We've got an interesting topic on game game industry salaries
244.67999999999998,246.67999999999998, They got posted I think
246.67999999999998,250.51999999999998," Monday, huh? Well, is the see it's the game game developers magazine"
251.39999999999998,252.67999999999998, A port they do
252.67999999999998,257.88, Uh-huh so we have some interesting figures about that and why you should be in the game industry if you're not
258.52,262.91999999999996, Once you see these numbers you would definitely want to be in it
265.8,268.12, Like this the rest of the podcast
268.84,271.32, Some good news about the battle story galactica
271.64,274.52, That's our galactic game free online
276.2,282.36, So you can you know play as not even it's not it's not like it's more like a Sam right it's not a
282.76,286.52," I don't get the play as number six say right no, it's yeah, it's strictly"
287.08,289.08," Spaceblood yeah, okay"
290.12,297.08, And we got some other we got some other hot topics this week. I think Sean's gonna regal us with our cage story at some point
297.96,303.4," But I heard that's what I thought that's rumor has it that's the weird one street. Oh, but first is anybody playing anything"
303.4,309.56, I will start off. Mm-hmm. I'm just gonna talk. Hey Jeff. What do you think what are you playing glad you asked?
310.2,315.15999999999997, I'll tell you what I'm playing rest of you guys shut up. I tried to play stalker and I couldn't
316.2,320.2, I've got a 2.5 gigahertz machine one giga ram
321.0,325.24, 8800 video card and that was not good enough for stalker
325.88,331.47999999999996, You're right with the dynamic who lighting I mess with all that and it's still ran like but
333.0,335.0, That's post patch
335.0,339.96," Yes, pretty unpost patch. Oh, I actually I don't have your hair by the specific the patch came out and actually"
340.59999999999997,342.03999999999996, Negated game saves
342.03999999999996,346.52," Yeah, but since I couldn't play it in the first place. I had nothing to save with effect. You very much. Yeah"
346.59999999999997,353.64, It was just very stuttery. I couldn't I couldn't do it. In effect. It affected me deeply after I spent 10 hours playing and my game saved was destroyed
355.0,360.91999999999996," Really said he could start over and I'm holding off for now. Yeah, are they fixing that have they patched the patch? Do we know yet?"
361.71999999999997,364.12, Haven't heard anything yet. I actually been waiting
364.12,367.96," I've been trying to get hold my my contact over a THQ to find out what the deal is there, but"
369.15999999999997,373.64," Well, I don't have CNC yet and I'm still trying to finish infernal"
374.12,379.24, But I was hoping to get some stalker in and it would not happen because I don't have a good enough machine anymore
380.12,383.08, Something's not right. I think you need to mess with the settings a bit
383.47999999999996,388.44, So I just was talking to someone like I running and running well on a 70-800
389.15999999999997,397.32," Really, yeah, but maybe their process was better than mine or they are more ram than me. No, I don't have a gig around. Do you have the suck mode box checked?"
398.2,405.64," Do I forgot? Yeah, see you got to check the suck mode. Yeah, I was going through all that"
405.64,409.64," You know, I restarted my machine five times and it was definitely having one of those moments of"
410.28,413.56," Yeah, this is why PC gaming so great. Yeah, when I just"
414.28,416.6, I reviewed the last splinter so I had to buy
417.71999999999997,422.2, Another stick of ram for my home PC because I didn't have enough to run it. Yeah
423.15999999999997,427.88," Well, Shawn you were I mean you're the machine you're playing on the home is pretty budget right? Well, that's it. That's with the"
429.15999999999997,434.94," With the lighting turned it turned down at home, but on that you know on a radiant 90-100 card"
434.94,437.94, It runs fine really decent frame race
439.09999999999997,441.09999999999997," Well, we'll see"
441.74,444.21999999999997, Anybody else play anything else about that I'm done with me
445.41999999999996,451.32, Self-self-self-self- guilt see. I was apparently I really hate myself. I was playing tortilla tortilla tortuga two tiluras
452.2,453.68, or two good two treasures.
453.68,454.12, Yeah.
454.12,454.84, TTT.
454.84,455.44," Yeah, exactly."
455.44,457.8," Basically, imagine pirates ripped off."
457.8,459.32, And then they just kind of took basically someone
459.32,461.8," watched the pirates, the Caribbean marathon or something."
461.8,465.96," And they're like, they're so literally just hijacked the plot"
465.96,466.59999999999997, and the characters.
466.59999999999997,467.96," I mean, the captain."
467.96,469.56," We mean the gameplay of pirates,"
469.56,470.56," Sid Myers, pirates."
470.56,472.91999999999996," They try to lift some of the gameplay of Sid Myers, pirates,"
472.91999999999996,476.71999999999997," and the plot of pirates, the Caribbean."
476.71999999999997,477.56, OK.
477.56,479.56, So it's such a blatant rip off.
479.56,482.03999999999996, But does it have that it's the same gameplay as pirates?
482.04,483.96000000000004, Kind of like exploration.
483.96000000000004,485.96000000000004," And it's not so much about the exploration,"
485.96000000000004,488.08000000000004," at least what I've played so far, is all about like,"
488.08000000000004,490.12, it just leads you down this one path.
490.12,491.68," And you just, here's one."
491.68,492.92, Here's one mini game.
492.92,493.76000000000005, Here's a cutscene.
493.76000000000005,495.8, Here's another mini game.
495.8,497.68, They could just place it in the pirates' pirates instead.
497.68,499.28000000000003, That's exactly what I thought.
499.28000000000003,502.68," Because that game, even the remake, was classic."
502.68,503.68, That game was gold.
503.68,504.36, I love that game.
504.36,507.6," It did not get as much hype, I think, as it should have."
507.6,508.56," I mean, I thought I could."
508.56,509.92," I remember going like, I agree with that."
509.92,512.0," After about two hours of playing,"
512.0,513.76, I went back to playing pirates.
513.76,517.76," I mean, it made me realize how much I missed a good pirate game."
517.76,519.32, I still got that one on my laptop.
519.32,520.12, Yeah.
520.12,520.76, Yep.
520.76,521.84, I'm going to dig that one up.
521.84,523.24, Because that was a great game.
523.24,525.2, The only thing I couldn't quite dig at behind was the
525.2,527.04," courtly dancing part, but other than that,"
527.04,528.68, I liked the courtly design.
528.68,530.92, That was amused.
530.92,533.56, I didn't like the sneaking through town parts after all.
533.56,534.56," Oh, yeah."
534.56,537.36," That doesn't go to the, doesn't go to the one."
537.36,539.56," Actually, if it's only that they do try this in Tortuget,"
539.56,541.16," the one thing they try to do, it's kind of interesting,"
541.16,543.64," but they make it so like, lopsided."
543.64,545.4," When you do that sneaking around town thing,"
545.4,548.04, it's actually a click fest.
548.04,552.1999999999999," You're like, you know, having combat against the port guards"
552.1999999999999,553.28, and stuff.
553.28,555.68," But God forbid, you see, one actually sees you"
555.68,556.68, and I just gang up on you.
556.68,558.8399999999999," So you're fighting off the night, guys, at once,"
558.8399999999999,560.8, and you're dead inside of a minute.
560.8,561.76, That doesn't sound like fun.
561.76,562.6, Not really.
562.6,564.56, Did you find one of the two treasures or none of them?
564.56,566.72," I said, you know what, you keep the treasure going."
566.72,567.4, I'll be fine.
567.4,572.4," See, I'm just showing there, Sean Elliott."
573.1999999999999,574.36," I'll sound like a broken record,"
574.36,575.8, and then I'm playing ill too.
575.8,577.16," No, but at first I will."
577.16,578.9599999999999," And I'm playing ill too,"
578.9599999999999,581.72," storm of igniting 46, which came out recently."
581.72,582.72, And I had to say the whole name
582.72,584.56," because I've noticed quite a few people asking,"
584.56,587.12," what's that, flight sim, he's talking about?"
587.12,588.4399999999999," But I won't sound like a broken record,"
588.4399999999999,589.1999999999999," and then it was like,"
589.1999999999999,593.1999999999999, and then I'm passing through phases of appreciation for the game.
593.1999999999999,594.64," And I think I've gone through the whole,"
594.64,596.6," like I did the whole, okay,"
596.6,599.12, let's make fun of the rivet counting stuff
599.12,601.5600000000001," and make fun of just like how many knobs and dials are,"
601.5600000000001,603.4," and then moved into the phase of,"
603.4,604.5600000000001," I think for example, this weekend,"
604.5600000000001,607.48, I want to best buy a looking for rudder pedals.
607.48,608.32," Oh, wow."
608.32,610.24," So basically, that you're in the acceptance phase."
610.24,611.52," I mean, the acceptance phase."
611.52,614.2," And just like, and in addition,"
614.2,615.84," I wanted to find, so I'm still trying to track down"
615.84,618.8000000000001," a track I are, which is basically the latest version"
618.8000000000001,621.24," is you put a hat on, and it just,"
621.24,623.4," you know, the sensor, you put on top of your monitor,"
623.4,625.76," and it will gauge where, you know, where your head's looking."
625.76,627.56," Which is the thing that's so rad of being a hero,"
627.56,628.4, or a bad person.
628.4,629.24, I am so good.
629.24,630.08, I don't know.
630.08,630.92, I don't know.
630.92,631.96, Because it's a good feeling.
631.96,634.8," No, the whole thing with the head track and stuff,"
634.8,637.0," and this is, I think if you can appreciate this,"
637.0,638.28," if you don't even play a type of game,"
638.28,640.84," is that since you're moving your own,"
640.84,643.6," the equivalent of your own head independently of the cockpit,"
643.6,644.4," and that's not something,"
644.4,645.3199999999999," I mean, people that play battlefield"
645.3199999999999,647.3199999999999," get it to an extent where you hold down control,"
647.3199999999999,649.3199999999999," and you're able to mouse, look to the left of your,"
649.3199999999999,650.68," you know, out your window of your helicopter,"
650.68,652.2," or whatever, see where your door got,"
652.2,653.8," or in the black hoc same, you know."
653.8,656.4," But I mean, when you're in a big, you know,"
656.4,657.52," in a tight turn or something,"
657.52,659.28," and you look up through the top of the plane,"
659.28,661.7199999999999," which is the equivalent of looking sideways,"
661.7199999999999,662.92," and you're very,"
662.92,664.0799999999999," and one of your, you know,"
664.0799999999999,666.4, one of your physical senses is aware of the momentum
666.4,668.16," that your plane's traveling with, you know,"
668.16,669.7199999999999," where that's going, but you're also, you know,"
669.7199999999999,672.7199999999999," you do feel like, I mean, it's hard to pinpoint it,"
672.7199999999999,675.24," but the level of immersion is definitely something,"
675.24,676.76," I haven't had it a long time, you know,"
676.76,677.76," that feeling like when you go in,"
677.76,680.4," you play a really good, not a ride simulator,"
680.4,681.76," but like I'm really good, our K-game,"
681.76,683.76," that has some sort of gimmick implemented into,"
683.76,685.92," but you're like, this is actually cool."
685.92,688.36," I mean, it's kind of nerdy, and I've paid 75 cents for this,"
688.36,690.48," but it's working in a way where,"
690.48,691.8," as long as I quit being such, like,"
691.8,695.12," I don't know, a hard to play a jaded old gamer"
695.12,696.72," and just kind of come at this, like,"
696.72,698.08," in a way that maybe you're, I don't know,"
698.08,701.52," you're brother or whatever, it is just a cool feeling."
701.52,703.88, We know that also works with racing games too.
703.88,705.72," Yeah, it worked with all sorts of games."
705.72,707.96, And so how hard do you have to move your head
707.96,710.24, to make a very small amount?
710.24,712.3199999999999," And I've watched videos of it in use,"
712.32,714.72," like dog fighting videos of people winning,"
714.72,716.2," using it, of course, their promotional,"
716.2,718.12, I'm sure they were put on YouTube by the company.
718.12,720.6400000000001," But you could tell though, it's really smooth and fluid."
720.6400000000001,722.88," And so if I wanted to look all the way straight up,"
722.88,724.6400000000001, I'd probably just move a little bit.
724.6400000000001,726.5200000000001," Okay, so you're not like looking way up"
726.5200000000001,727.36, and then your eyes are rolling out.
727.36,729.72," Yeah, then you can't even keep your eyes on the screen."
729.72,730.88," But whether or not you use that,"
730.88,732.12," what I do with my controllers,"
732.12,734.7600000000001," I map that, I have the equivalent of a mouse knob"
734.7600000000001,737.36," from a laptop, you know, on my throttle,"
737.36,740.2," and I'm able to do it with that, and that works fine."
741.2,743.9200000000001, But don't you think if I was sitting across from you here
743.9200000000001,746.44," wearing a head, and I told you that I was"
746.44,749.0," any of it's gonna come in, playing World of Warcraft,"
749.0,751.84," and I had to head set on so that like when I get my spells,"
751.84,753.84," it's just pure like, I totally make it fun."
753.84,755.84," But here's the thing, like the guy,"
755.84,758.12," there's a certain amount of like, okay,"
758.12,760.6," special pleading, whatever, but these things"
760.6,762.0, I'm about to tell you are true.
762.0,764.24," Okay, the guy who made this all look mad at you."
764.24,765.48," So I was on the one-up show last night,"
765.48,767.9200000000001," everyone's telling us about all the,"
767.9200000000001,770.1600000000001," feel up to peanut farmer, whoever who made this game,"
770.16,772.88," you know, but I'm like, do you, this guy is a,"
774.0799999999999,777.92, he was part of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
777.92,780.36," back in the day, that's not, that's not pussy stuff."
780.36,781.68, I hope he's not bragging about it.
781.68,783.24," He's not, he's not, he's not, that was too cool"
783.24,784.0799999999999, when they did that.
784.0799999999999,785.12," No, he's definitely not bragging about it,"
785.12,786.56, and he's debating about the country.
786.56,787.6, He wouldn't even talk about it.
787.6,788.6, There is not a good guy right?
788.6,790.56," Because someone on his,"
791.76,795.12," someone on his team, I won't name posts on a forum,"
795.12,797.72," and they talk about just generally the philosophy of the game,"
797.72,799.9599999999999," whether or not, you know, they actually depict violence."
799.96,803.1600000000001," I mean, depict a gore, and if you know in the latest versions,"
803.1600000000001,804.24," when you are hit in your cockpit,"
804.24,806.4000000000001," there's no blood, your screen starts to go red,"
806.4000000000001,807.64," but that was a big thing, is that,"
807.64,812.9200000000001," oh, I want to know visual like depictions of gore or anything"
812.9200000000001,815.64," in this thing, and you doesn't even want to talk about that stuff."
815.64,817.1600000000001," That's why you probably know Moses,"
817.1600000000001,819.12," I mean, and I don't, they're not upset with me for saying this"
819.12,820.84," because I did find this in a forum, but no,"
820.84,822.84," so he definitely doesn't go around,"
822.84,824.76," I mean, in the same way, you know, that like,"
824.76,826.72," that you'd imagine, you don't go bragging about,"
826.72,828.5600000000001," about those, you know, that experience,"
828.56,831.76, but it shaped him.
831.76,832.5999999999999, I'm sure of that.
832.5999999999999,835.16," You know, clearly, well, the fact, in the negative sense"
835.16,837.3199999999999," that you don't have that kind of stuff in the game,"
837.3199999999999,841.04," but anyway, it's one of those notches on your belt,"
841.04,844.76," this is at least of all things, you're not the peanut farmer,"
844.76,845.5999999999999, whatever.
847.0,850.88," So back to the game, some of the cool stuff that we've been doing now"
850.88,852.8399999999999," is like, I played this with Matt Peckham,"
852.8399999999999,854.8399999999999, who's reviewing it for us this issue.
854.8399999999999,856.3199999999999," My friend, Rory, we're playing online,"
856.6,859.5200000000001," EGM's CRISPR Boyer is going to be joining us, too,"
859.5200000000001,862.6400000000001," in our little, little click of nerds."
862.6400000000001,864.6400000000001, He's going to be riding like an Amario plane
864.6400000000001,866.08," or something, so he feels comfortable there."
866.08,867.08, No.
867.08,869.12," But why am I just like,"
869.12,870.12, I'm already playing.
870.12,871.4000000000001," Brody's a little Mario plane,"
871.4000000000001,872.5600000000001, I'm not so boy.
872.5600000000001,874.72, That's all they play over there at EGM as Mario.
874.72,876.7600000000001, Maybe you can ride around in a giant mushroom.
876.7600000000001,878.72," But, like, some of the cool, like,"
878.72,881.08," a cool mission that we've been doing,"
881.08,884.8000000000001, which is ties into something else I want to say about the game.
885.24,886.64," And this is all, I'll say that first."
886.64,888.4," This is that when you hear about this kind of game,"
888.4,890.88," you're like, okay, there's no way this is accessible."
890.88,892.4399999999999, This is for a certain type of person.
892.4399999999999,894.3599999999999," You're already like, there's a category,"
894.3599999999999,895.3599999999999," whatever you're calling me,"
895.3599999999999,897.24, a person that plays this kind of game.
897.24,900.4," But I think the press has done a poor job in that,"
900.4,903.28," we talk, we do talk, like when I first came on and talked about it,"
903.28,906.4399999999999, we do talk about this sense of this insider's club.
906.4399999999999,908.04, If you have to be able to do this in this
908.04,909.68, in order to be part of this club.
909.68,911.8399999999999," But they're easy modes, you can turn all the stuff off."
911.8399999999999,914.68," If you want to make it so that there are no clouds,"
914.68,917.16," your bullets don't drop, you can't stall,"
917.16,920.0799999999999," there's no wind, you don't even have to take off."
920.0799999999999,922.12," These are all independence, which is you can click"
922.12,923.4799999999999," every single one of them, you can make it,"
923.4799999999999,925.88," so you don't feel G force, you can't pass out,"
925.88,927.92, you can't bleed every single thing.
927.92,930.2399999999999," And when you do that, the game becomes increasingly more"
930.2399999999999,933.76," archady, but it also means that you can go in."
933.76,936.64," And as you acclimate yourself to what's happening,"
936.64,938.5999999999999, create a lesson for yourself one at a time
938.5999999999999,940.5999999999999," by adding more and more, by clicking more and more,"
940.5999999999999,942.8," these things and saying, okay, now let's introduce this"
942.8,943.8, into this seminar.
943.9599999999999,946.7199999999999, It's ultimately end up at the point where
947.7199999999999,948.68, that you hear about.
948.68,951.0," But to think about this, that makes it different from other"
951.0,952.4399999999999," flight systems and combat flight systems,"
952.4399999999999,957.0," is that like, oh, it thinks that flying itself is really easy."
957.0,958.16, It's not a difficult thing.
958.16,960.92, And he actually argues that other sim creators go wrong
960.92,963.64," in that, just trying to say, I mean,"
963.64,966.56," wearing that complexity or that intricacy,"
966.56,969.0, like a badge of belonging or something.
969.0,971.56," And he says that, I mean, when it comes down to it,"
971.56,973.68," I mean, yes, planes have all these gauges and dials"
973.68,974.52, and stuff.
974.52,975.7199999999999, But the pilot's only looking at one of them
975.7199999999999,976.88, and it give time.
976.88,978.1999999999999," Well, I mean, it's the same way."
978.1999999999999,979.4, It's the fuels what they're looking at.
979.4,982.4799999999999," And if you go into a lectures, you see a million lit up gauges"
982.4799999999999,983.3199999999999, and stuff.
983.3199999999999,985.4399999999999," But you've driven a car, you know, you just like, hey,"
985.4399999999999,988.0," you know, maybe you need to look down there once in a while."
988.0,990.8, But it's a combat itself that gets intricate.
990.8,992.0, But it's also really rewarding.
992.0,995.3199999999999, So here's the thing that was taken back to the actual experience
995.3199999999999,996.9599999999999," that we did have is like, we're basically just playing"
996.9599999999999,998.5999999999999, these missions where it's just us
998.5999999999999,1001.1999999999999, in these experimental German jets.
1001.1999999999999,1003.4399999999999," And they have high caliber cannons attached,"
1003.44,1004.96, but also these wire guided rockets.
1004.96,1006.8800000000001, Now I'm going to try to put this on hot.
1006.8800000000001,1008.36," And we're fighting and we're taking out like,"
1008.36,1010.08," you know, big squadron of B-29s."
1010.08,1010.6800000000001, But it's just cool.
1010.6800000000001,1013.08," I mean, you shoot your missile and then use your separate controller"
1013.08,1015.5200000000001, to like kind of steer the missile into them.
1015.5200000000001,1018.0," And I mean, unlike, you know, another game,"
1018.0,1019.8800000000001," like you're hitting these and parts are falling off,"
1019.8800000000001,1021.72, you could specifically see engines come off
1021.72,1024.3200000000002, or a wing comes off and the whole thing just tips over.
1024.3200000000002,1027.24," And you'll see, we end up, they'll start feathering the props"
1027.24,1028.44, and try to get the other turn to rest
1028.44,1031.1200000000001, of the engines on that side off and get the other ones up.
1031.1200000000001,1032.92, And it's just cool.
1033.28,1033.76, It's fun.
1033.76,1034.6000000000001, It's still like it.
1034.6000000000001,1035.44, And I found a new love.
1035.44,1037.8400000000001," No, it's interesting to listen to you go through this."
1037.8400000000001,1042.04," I mean, it's probably not that usual these days I would think."
1042.04,1043.96," To watch someone, you know,"
1043.96,1047.16, actually get into this particular genre now.
1047.16,1049.0," Yeah, it experienced the, you know,"
1049.0,1051.76, newbie through wanting to add features
1051.76,1053.96, until your an actual experience guy.
1053.96,1056.5600000000002," I mean, you're, you're getting into this right at the point"
1056.5600000000002,1058.16, where there's practically no games
1058.16,1059.3200000000002, and there's genre anymore.
1059.3200000000002,1061.3600000000001," Yeah, I mean, there are still,"
1061.3600000000001,1062.52," there are still quite a few,"
1062.52,1064.2," but it's just not, yeah, like you're saying,"
1064.2,1067.08," I mean, you've been working in this room for long enough to know"
1067.08,1068.76, that you used to be a cover story every month.
1068.76,1070.8," Yeah, we talked about that last week and the old days."
1070.8,1074.16," It was, I mean, to me, the barrier to entry is still"
1075.96,1077.36, the joystick.
1077.36,1078.2, Right.
1078.2,1080.32," And it is hard because they don't have those,"
1080.32,1081.16," well, they did."
1081.16,1085.08, I was happy to see that they had the Cytec X5 to at best by.
1085.08,1087.84, And the non-promodel is like around $100 or something.
1087.84,1089.32," That's still as prohibitive, you know,"
1089.32,1091.6399999999999," but for it to be an impulse by,"
1091.64,1094.4, they really do need to have like some cheap sticks that are available.
1094.4,1096.0800000000002," So you just wander in some place and you're like,"
1096.0800000000002,1096.88," okay, cool."
1096.88,1097.72, That's a bad practice.
1097.72,1098.72, That's a bad practice.
1098.72,1099.72," There used to be everywhere, right?"
1099.72,1100.72," Yeah, they used to be everywhere."
1100.72,1103.72," I mean, it was really not unusual back in the day"
1103.72,1106.0400000000002, for us all to have them on our desk.
1106.0400000000002,1108.1200000000001," You know, even if we weren't hard core,"
1108.1200000000001,1109.4," a quantum-quot, flight sometimes."
1109.4,1110.24, Right.
1110.24,1111.0400000000002," You just, you'd have to add them."
1111.0400000000002,1113.0, Because it was just part of your PC gaming setup.
1113.0,1113.96, And I got money.
1113.96,1115.5200000000002, I got the stick you had.
1115.5200000000002,1117.3200000000002, It was a legacy from that.
1117.3200000000002,1118.8000000000002," Because I remember when I was at EGM,"
1118.8000000000002,1120.3600000000001, they would always see him floating around.
1120.36,1122.8799999999999," Whenever someone would get laid off or move or something,"
1122.8799999999999,1124.24, there's a pile of crap.
1124.24,1125.3999999999999, They didn't want to take with them.
1125.3999999999999,1127.8, It would always have like a brand new expensive flight stick in it.
1127.8,1128.6399999999999, Yep.
1128.6399999999999,1129.56," And this is kind of like,"
1129.56,1131.24, the legacy where I finally got around to it.
1131.24,1134.56," But I do think, one, it's kind of like,"
1134.56,1135.7199999999998, you get older.
1135.7199999999998,1137.7199999999998," You go from a gamer and you go from playing,"
1139.08,1139.8799999999999, I don't know.
1139.8799999999999,1140.9199999999998," I mean, just, you go from,"
1140.9199999999998,1142.6399999999999," I mean, call the UDL of, I don't know."
1142.6399999999999,1143.56, It's hard to think of a thing.
1143.56,1144.56, But you just branch out.
1144.56,1146.24, And you want different sorts of games.
1146.24,1147.56," You know, you start playing stuff like rope"
1147.56,1150.28," with universalism and ill-to when,"
1150.28,1152.6399999999999," I mean, that seems kind of natural with me."
1152.6399999999999,1153.48, It seems cool.
1153.48,1155.6399999999999, But I do want to proselytize for it just because I think
1155.6399999999999,1158.12," a lot more people than would enjoy it,"
1158.12,1160.08, than probably realize they would.
1160.08,1162.76," I'm kind of curious, because you've been a aviation buff"
1162.76,1163.28, for a long time.
1163.28,1165.32," And I got, you know, especially well,"
1165.32,1167.1599999999999," our two plans, right?"
1167.1599999999999,1168.52," Did you try other stuff in the past,"
1168.52,1171.6799999999998," like, you know, secret weapon weapons at a lift offer?"
1171.6799999999998,1174.12," I mean, all the console stuff."
1174.12,1176.28, So I would play anytime there would be like some
1176.28,1177.52, of some skies or stuff.
1177.52,1178.36," Yeah, some of the stuff."
1178.36,1180.92," Crimson skies and then, you know, the really poor games"
1180.92,1182.56," and all that, you know, damn cool stuff,"
1182.56,1183.52, which I really don't like.
1183.52,1185.56," I mean, it's like right now Ace Combat 6 screens"
1185.56,1186.56," are going around and they look great,"
1186.56,1187.3999999999999, but it's the same thing.
1187.3999999999999,1189.04, It's the same story as every time.
1189.04,1190.6399999999999," I mean, it's just night and day."
1190.6399999999999,1191.92," I mean, you can't, I honestly now,"
1191.92,1194.96, that you can't have any kind of good flight game.
1194.96,1196.2," It doesn't give you independent, like,"
1196.2,1198.2, look movement within your cockpit.
1198.2,1199.24," Go ahead, it's different with jets"
1199.24,1202.2," because you have other means of tracking, tracking,"
1202.2,1204.04," you know, targets in the air."
1204.04,1206.24," But, I mean, that's a huge part of it."
1206.24,1208.08," I mean, just being able to keep your eye on,"
1208.08,1210.28," on who you're chasing and everything and instead of,"
1210.28,1212.4," it feels, the console wants to feel so,"
1212.4,1214.08, and cruise skies is a whole other story.
1214.08,1216.16," And what it did right in its own way,"
1216.16,1219.1200000000001," it captured the verticality of air combat, which was cool."
1219.1200000000001,1221.08," Because you could put in a quick move,"
1221.08,1222.84," push one analog stick down the other up,"
1222.84,1224.4," and then suddenly you're going straight up,"
1224.4,1225.8, reverse it and you're going straight down.
1225.8,1227.64," Well, that just started as a PC game."
1227.64,1228.28, Yeah. Right.
1228.28,1229.0, Foss on.
1229.0,1230.56," But the other ones, though,"
1230.56,1232.44, I feel as if you're just going in a circle
1232.44,1235.56," on a flat plane to me, like on a disc or something, you know."
1235.56,1237.32," And it just is so, I mean,"
1237.32,1239.6799999999998, it just misses the whole feeling of going upside down
1239.6799999999998,1242.52, and looking up and seeing basically just like the ground
1242.52,1244.84," beneath you, you know, and cloud passing by"
1244.84,1247.08," and maybe another jet zips down beneath you,"
1247.08,1249.6799999999998, and then you just kind of flip down out of that inverted.
1249.6799999999998,1251.84," Now, that's a point at which I quit every single flight"
1251.84,1253.08, to my ever try.
1253.08,1256.28," Yeah. I see that the sky below me,"
1256.28,1260.8799999999999," I'm just like, ah, when I crash and I load something easy."
1260.8799999999999,1262.08, So I could do them or something.
1262.08,1262.9199999999998, Yeah.
1262.9199999999998,1263.9199999999998, Chop left.
1264.24,1266.3200000000002, So I guess we're going to have to make a thread
1266.3200000000002,1267.1200000000001, forward on our forms.
1267.1200000000001,1269.5600000000002," So I got people PM and me like, hey, I hear about this"
1269.5600000000002,1272.92," and can I get in your click, but we'll ultimately get"
1272.92,1274.0800000000002, together some big posses.
1274.0800000000002,1276.92, We'll go hunt the B29s like a big.
1276.92,1278.64, How big can those squadrons get?
1278.64,1280.0800000000002, Like 100 players or something?
1280.0800000000002,1281.3600000000001," No, it's not quite as big as that."
1281.3600000000001,1282.1200000000001, It's 32.
1282.1200000000001,1283.6000000000001, I think it's the max and the server.
1283.6000000000001,1285.92, But that's quite a few planes.
1285.92,1287.3600000000001," Well, and if you want to hunt Merrillogs,"
1287.3600000000001,1289.24, just send me and Sean the lie.
1289.24,1289.72, That's right.
1289.72,1290.3200000000002, Yeah.
1290.3200000000002,1292.0, You got a pot of Merrillog to do that.
1292.0,1293.44," Yeah, it's a whole lot of stuff about that."
1293.44,1294.8," Maybe if you get enough support,"
1294.8,1297.3600000000001, there could be a flight sim pod guess.
1297.3600000000001,1297.56," Oh, okay."
1297.56,1298.3600000000001, This is high.
1298.3600000000001,1302.48, The plan is actually there probably is a more
1302.48,1304.24, than one flight sim pod guess at probably.
1304.24,1305.0800000000002, I'm sure.
1305.0800000000002,1305.64, And it'll be soon.
1305.64,1306.56, I was that.
1306.56,1309.52, Mine would be like the retarded version of it.
1309.52,1314.04, So next we're talking about CNC.
1314.04,1314.56, I hope.
1314.56,1315.76, I hope if our copy.
1315.76,1317.72," Should we get copies, right?"
1317.72,1320.44, I'm psyched for CNC three.
1320.44,1322.52, It's supposed to be good.
1322.6,1323.72," Oh, and also what's it called?"
1323.72,1324.32, Just came out.
1324.32,1326.32, I'm going to take going to go home and play tonight.
1326.32,1327.48, Found out about it last night.
1327.48,1328.08, It was too late.
1328.08,1333.96," But does it conflict, which is new mod from it's not necessarily"
1333.96,1336.44, the same crew that made desert combat because they became chaos
1336.44,1337.8, studios or make front lines.
1337.8,1338.96, But it was Darren.
1338.96,1340.4, You said that their hand picked.
1340.4,1340.6, Yeah.
1340.6,1342.6, Basically what happened was they kind of passed the baton onto
1342.6,1344.52," like the next gen of devs, you know,"
1344.52,1346.28, upcoming devs that wanted to work on this.
1346.28,1348.04," So they just kind of, they have the blessings of the chaos"
1348.04,1349.0, studios guys.
1349.0,1352.28, So this is now a major battlefield to base mod.
1352.28,1356.36," That among other things, it's not necessarily a total realism"
1356.36,1358.76," mod, but it adds any all kinds of weird stuff for,"
1358.76,1359.36, or not weird stuff.
1359.36,1361.6," But it adds things from, you know,"
1361.6,1364.08," scut missiles and other types of, you know,"
1364.08,1367.8," armored fighting vehicles to take, I think all missiles"
1367.8,1370.3999999999999," are back to just being down fire, which was a huge point"
1370.3999999999999,1372.52," because I mean, the lock on missiles took a lot out"
1372.52,1376.04, of the air combat and battlefield to a number of other things.
1376.04,1378.84," New maps, but classic maps that from desert combat"
1378.84,1379.48, that they've updated.
1379.48,1380.6, Nice.
1380.6,1382.48, So that was the mod I played the most.
1382.48,1383.8799999999999, I'm going to look forward to that mod.
1383.8799999999999,1386.7199999999998," I'm surprised because if you had a hard time with battlefield,"
1386.7199999999998,1390.04," that I mean, that's, you'd get this trashed in that game."
1390.04,1391.1999999999998, I believe it or not.
1391.1999999999998,1392.36, I was actually good about a few.
1392.36,1393.48, I had 1842.
1393.48,1393.84, Yeah.
1393.84,1394.52, It was us two.
1394.52,1396.6799999999998, I just didn't play enough to get the hang of it.
1396.6799999999998,1398.04, Huh.
1398.04,1399.8, So hopefully report back now.
1399.8,1402.1999999999998, So maybe now is actually a good transition for the battle
1402.1999999999998,1406.52, start to act together because that actually is a conversion of a sim
1406.52,1408.04, of a space sim.
1408.04,1410.0," It's a total conversion of free space, too."
1410.0,1411.0, Is that right?
1411.0,1412.0, That's exactly what it is.
1412.0,1415.88," A classic space sim from interplay, one of their last final"
1415.88,1416.88, great games.
1416.88,1417.88, Yeah.
1417.88,1419.44," I was going to say, actually, I didn't get into the flight sim"
1419.44,1422.52," as nearly as much as some, but I space sims were was that for me."
1422.52,1425.48," Like private tier, wing commander."
1425.48,1426.68, They're playing all those.
1426.68,1427.88, That was totally my thing.
1427.88,1428.88, X wing.
1428.88,1429.76, Show for sure.
1429.76,1429.88, Yeah.
1429.88,1431.68, All the X wing tie fighters stuff.
1431.68,1433.84," But anyway, so the battle start to act to a game."
1433.84,1435.36, It's actually called Beyond the Red Line.
1435.36,1439.84, And you can find it at www.gamehifinwardin.com.
1439.84,1440.84, slash BSG.
1440.84,1445.4399999999998," And it's basically, it's a totally free game since a free space"
1445.4399999999998,1446.6, two is now open source.
1446.6,1449.08, So that's a double for free as well.
1449.08,1451.08, And that is a bargain.
1451.08,1453.04," And that free free space, too."
1453.04,1454.48, I would go get that if I were you.
1454.48,1455.48, Totally.
1455.48,1458.08, And so basically it's a total conversion.
1458.08,1461.36," And it's still in the demo phase, but you can download it right now"
1461.36,1465.76, in place of multiplayer at a demo of the campaign that's going to go forward.
1465.76,1467.6, So can you play as both human and silent?
1467.6,1469.48, Or what's it to be over?
1470.1200000000001,1474.24," You know, as far as I know, you can do human for now."
1474.24,1475.24, Okay.
1475.24,1478.24," I can silence, but there's probably more to it in multiplayer."
1478.24,1480.4, Like obviously like silent versus human in multiplayer.
1480.4,1482.24," You still, none of us have played this yet."
1482.24,1483.24," Well, it happened."
1483.24,1486.1200000000001, I was actually downloading it last night in my computer crash.
1486.1200000000001,1487.52, So I have to reload it.
1487.52,1488.52, Awesome.
1488.52,1489.52," So no, right?"
1489.52,1490.52, So that'd be a big fat note.
1490.52,1492.24, I was wondering how different it is than free space.
1492.24,1493.24, Is it just new skins?
1493.24,1494.72," You know, I mean, is it like?"
1494.72,1497.1200000000001," Well, the thing is, free space was like an arcade shooter."
1497.1200000000001,1499.3600000000001," And apparently, you know, it wasn't like, you know, true."
1499.36,1501.12, It was like I was just in my own physics and all that stuff.
1501.12,1504.12, And just obviously it was based with zero gravity.
1504.12,1505.08, But they try.
1505.08,1508.7199999999998, They are apparently adding some more stuff to it.
1508.7199999999998,1511.4399999999998," I don't know much more than that right now, but it's, you know,"
1511.4399999999998,1512.6399999999999, hella prices right.
1512.6399999999999,1513.6399999999999, It's my free way.
1513.6399999999999,1514.6399999999999, Take a week.
1514.6399999999999,1515.6399999999999, So let me see it.
1515.6399999999999,1518.08, I'm just kind of reading off the about from the upside.
1518.08,1519.08, Sure.
1519.08,1520.08," Sure, go ahead."
1520.08,1521.08, They see.
1521.08,1522.08, So multiplayer features.
1522.08,1523.08," A death match, team death match."
1523.08,1524.08, King of the Hill.
1524.08,1525.08, Gauntlet missions.
1525.08,1526.7199999999998, And possibly co-op.
1526.72,1534.1200000000001," right now you can fly a Viper Mark 2, Viper Mark 7 and the Raptor. So anyone who's"
1534.1200000000001,1537.42," watched the current show not the 1970s one, that's the experience you're"
1537.42,1540.04, going. So I could be Starbuck. You could be Starbuck. You could be
1540.04,1543.16, character already be Starbuck. I might be. Can't be Scar though. I'd like to
1543.16,1550.3600000000001, dress like her. What? You can't be Scar. No. Okay. So maybe we'll actually try to
1550.3600000000001,1553.56, check that out and report back whether it's worth it or not. But definitely the
1553.56,1557.6," free space too is though. Yeah. Well, I'll I'll I'll know by tonight. I'm"
1557.6,1560.96, downloading it again. And you're right. Can't go wrong for free. You can.
1560.96,1565.2, I have a disagree. Because there's so many who can crash.
1565.2,1570.24," Head and leave down those mods. No, but I mean, it depends on how much hard"
1570.24,1571.9199999999998," drive you space for you. You'll get a mod. And you're like, okay, that"
1571.9199999999998,1575.24, definitely was not even worth bothering. It wasn't worth the effort to
1575.24,1579.76, download. I suppose. I so just didn't you download like doom maps by the
1580.08,1584.4," 1000s. I used to do that. The wads. That's yeah. Oh, God, that would be bad."
1584.4,1587.6, If you were in like a slow loading map and you get a map in the first thing
1587.6,1590.64," getting an in addition to hearing like, you know, crossing the clown sound by"
1590.64,1593.96, it's just it's just it's nothing but you look on the ground. There's like a
1593.96,1597.72, billion weapons every kind of weapon. Yeah. Yeah. You need some ammunition
1597.72,1601.2, for it. They do that in half life too. And they got the pulse rifle all
1601.2,1605.08," far, which we call the shrimp cannon. And it's just like it's instant death and"
1605.08,1608.32," ricochets around. As soon as you get in some, you're like, Oh, maybe this will be"
1608.32,1611.52, good. And that I'm thinking about how when they when that have like two
1611.52,1614.6, death match first came out. They're only like two maps. So you'd be eager
1614.6,1619.4399999999998," for anything new hoping there'd just be some capable map maker was quick, but"
1619.4399999999998,1623.6799999999998," no, I'm talking about it. It's goddamn shrimp cannon. The giant boss."
1626.24,1629.9199999999998," Well, they can't all be gold. There's a lot of good maps now. I just take"
1629.9199999999998,1632.84, it just took time sometimes you need the intentionally bad map that are
1632.84,1636.28," really appreciate how good. How good some mapping. But I have. Sorry, you need a"
1636.28,1640.32," baseline. Right. I mean, I remember once I intentionally designed a map where"
1640.32,1643.8799999999999," there was like, there's big pit in the middle and you drop in it. Like all"
1643.8799999999999,1646.48," the weapons and everything you want is there, which can't get back out of the"
1646.48,1650.44, hole. So you made that intentionally. I made that intentionally. I wasn't just
1650.44,1654.52, okay. I have a whole fixation with bad movies and just bad designs camp
1654.52,1659.08," back design. Exactly that. Yeah. You know, that's my story. I'm sticking to"
1659.08,1666.9199999999998," what's next. Mr. Malay, have you been playing anything besides"
1666.9199999999998,1670.84, while? Not really. Now really? No. Get here all about my walk talk and
1670.84,1673.28, legendary thread podcast. What up.com.
1673.28,1679.48, But nice play a little bit of bookworm adventures bookworm adventure.
1679.48,1682.6799999999998," Yeah. I've never done play a whole lot when it came out. So I finally said, okay,"
1682.6799999999998,1685.76, I enjoyed Peggle. Let me try this bookworm a little more. Gotta think a little more
1685.84,1689.04," with bookworm. Yeah. Quite at the Peggle level of, you know,"
1689.04,1692.32," draw coming out of your mouth while you're playing. Peggle is not, is not that"
1692.32,1696.8," way though. Like I've, that's something like a daily rotation still. Still doing. Yeah."
1696.8,1700.44," Yeah. But the more you play Peggle, the more you get into the strategy. In the"
1700.44,1705.04," more you, I mean, clearly we're not talking, you know, it's not playing pool or"
1705.04,1708.36," something. But you do see, you get to the point like I guarantee you play it"
1708.36,1712.08," for like a couple days. And instead of just saying, oh, this is probably good"
1712.08,1714.92, because I can imagine it's going to just generally be in this area and there are
1714.92,1718.4, a lot of pegs over here. Right. Like you at least visualize pretty clearly
1718.4,1722.64, past the first ricochet into the second one. Right. You start and then once you
1722.64,1727.4," once you do that, once you're third eye sees it coming and it does come"
1727.4,1731.48," that way, it's pretty, it's pretty gratified. Yep. It's not like learning to"
1731.48,1735.48, fly or like or like getting spelling. Yeah. I've only had you on it. You had one of
1735.48,1739.46," those headsets for. Yeah. For all, what's your big version of all?"
1739.46,1744.4," Peggle's your bookworm word. I don't know. I was, I found myself"
1744.4,1748.2," being annoyed by, I think I had like a really awesome word and I started spelling"
1748.2,1752.16, it and then nothing happened. Like it didn't know. It didn't
1752.16,1754.76, register. Sometimes it dictionary sucks on that thing. Yeah. I was very annoyed.
1754.76,1758.0," I was like, I have predictions. This is going to get this triptus. Wow. And then"
1758.0,1760.8000000000002," I got to send an angry letter. I don't know if it was, I don't know if it was"
1760.8000000000002,1763.92," was predictions. But it was some, some big word that I was pretty sure was both"
1763.92,1768.6000000000001," things. Maybe it wasn't. I was just like, hey, you should be able to update"
1768.6000000000001,1773.0800000000002, that dictionary too. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. I like it. It's fun. It's fun getting
1773.08,1778.6399999999999, the Golden Flies and using it somehow. A word game. I still play it. I can do
1778.6399999999999,1783.8799999999999," it. It is. That's about it, though. All right. Should we take a break and"
1783.8799999999999,1789.4399999999998, come back with more news and stories and wackiness? I got a story until any
1789.4399999999998,1793.96, time to you. You got it. We'll come back with Sean's arcade story. We're right
1793.96,1803.76," there. Oh, hello. I didn't see there. But as long as you're here, let me tell"

1832.64,1841.44," not guaranteed to be a fan tabulous. Hi, we're back. Maybe I may be Ryan can do his show again."
1841.44,1847.6200000000001," Why do that again? Ryan, what are we up to? Oh, wait, you're here. Oh, I know. You're"
1847.6999999999998,1853.5," back in. Bring his back in, Ryan. Yes, I'm still here. Okay, we're glad. You know,"
1853.5,1858.1799999999998," you get this for the not talking, but I think that I think they're wrong. I think those"
1858.1799999999998,1862.9399999999998, people who say like Ryan should visit kick Ryan off. He never says anything. They don't
1862.9399999999998,1866.9799999999998," know what it's like to be sitting here. You know, Ryan's kind of like the Greek carouser."
1866.9799999999998,1872.6599999999999," He sits here. He nods while we're talking. So smile. Right, we're saying something funny"
1872.6599999999999,1877.02, to someone's going to hate on everything. We're kind of like podcasts for Ryan here.
1877.02,1881.1," He sort of like, I'm not. I had today. I was reading people saying he talked over everyone."
1881.1,1888.94, Who you for me. You shot out Sean. There's a certain balance to all things. I like to say
1888.94,1895.26, one guy enough. You're pretty good. I'm looking dude. I say that in the most disparaging way.
1898.06,1903.66," So compared me to what would you say Bob Sagitt and Robin Williams, but without the name."
1903.74,1911.18, Ouch. Robin Williams. I told him maybe we could see through this misunderstanding if he
1911.18,1916.94," came in a visit meeting my never, it never landed with Martin Bashir. Damn."
1917.8200000000002,1924.14," Get a nasty. Yeah. No, that's not a fucking normal. No, it's like, I don't know."
1924.7,1929.8200000000002, You got to think about it. There's some humor in there. I think Martin Bashir was the whole thing
1929.82,1934.3799999999999," where Jack goes like, you know what? I'm going to use people are saying I'm fucked up. I'm going to tell"
1934.3799999999999,1939.34, him I'm not. And I'm going to bring this mark. But sure guy over to my my fun land. And he's going to make a video
1939.34,1945.1, that proves everyone that I really am a cool guy. So it's kind of like saying like come over here and prove that
1945.1,1949.5," I'm for the purpose of proving that I'm not as bad as you say, but ultimately finding out that I'm worse than"
1949.5,1956.7," any. Anyway, we can try to well sophisticated. It's too. Can't get it. You're operating"
1956.8600000000001,1961.66, higher level. Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't know about the video the videographer hired by Michael Jackson.
1962.7,1968.6200000000001, Martin Bashir that was epic when that came out. Was he the dude? That was that big special that like two
1968.6200000000001,1973.42," hours. Yeah, two are special and they went to never went. He was like going around through, you know,"
1973.42,1978.8600000000001," through Vegas like the Blasio. Oh, take this one and he was like, I had the Charlie Green"
1978.8600000000001,1983.74, Jack. And he was very defensive. Sure. It's Michael. Wasn't he? Just because you're lying touching a
1983.82,1990.86," boy's does not really mean you're a molester. No, no, Martin. I do. I do this with our children."
1990.86,1995.1, Because you love them. Don't you Michael? With his special children. Only his special
1995.9,2002.86," but I touched them too, Michael. Well, we have his special children. That was the one."
2002.86,2008.3," No, it was a big big day. I like why would you need me to talk. Exactly. He teaches children"
2008.3,2014.46," Ethan Greenpeace. Oh, oh, oh, oh, he didn't join. He's stuck in a giant robot and Vibrisard."
2014.46,2019.8999999999999, I dreamed that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He is. Yeah. Because that was one of the key events of the
2019.8999999999999,2027.18, 20 first century. Okay. Stribula giant captain. Leo. Okay. Let's real this back in. There's something
2027.18,2032.7, related to what our podcast wants to be. Yeah. We're in Mark Moonmark was the video game. We're
2033.02,2040.8600000000001, in our cage. We're talking about video games. Okay. Yeah. Tell your our cage join now.
2040.8600000000001,2046.7," Sean while we're at this extreme. Well, right. Okay. Get any more. Right. Right."
2046.7,2051.18, Without spoiling the detail because I did tell Ryan I gave Ryan the teaser at lunch.
2051.18,2054.3, Yeah. How did you feel about how did it make you feel right?
2055.02,2059.82," Oh, this is going to be the new. Wow. Okay. I can't wait for that. So this is said. Yeah."
2059.82,2063.42," Maybe I should say. I don't know. Every time I say I should save it, I go into it."
2064.2200000000003,2069.98," So I'm just going to do it. Oh, my god. I got a roll. All right. One time in my friend Cori and I mentioned"
2069.98,2075.42, this guy before in the context of this is the guy I left with this it's saying rivalry of fighting
2075.42,2081.5800000000004, games Street Fighter tech in Mortal Kombat virtual fighter later on Soul Calibur and he got on a
2081.5800000000004,2087.6600000000003, big run and Mortal Kombat and just was talking shit on me the whole time. And so in the past I that the guy
2087.74,2093.3399999999997," left it dark. I was like, all right then. Yeah. It's like got in my car and left it there."
2094.2999999999997,2099.1, Call your dad and have him come get you to your sister. So that was dick. That was like the one that
2099.1,2105.8199999999997, was why a couple years ago. Take maneuvers out from. But so this same guy we're on our way back to
2105.8199999999997,2111.8999999999996, that same arcade. This is where so many all the fun stuff happened. And he came to pick me up at my
2111.9,2119.1," dorm at, uh, and we're driving in the whole time. He's just tearing ass, you know, we're just driving"
2119.1,2123.1800000000003, and it's the kind where at first like I have the window rolled down and I have like my head hanging
2123.1800000000003,2127.7400000000002," out and you know, eventually how when someone's farting around you and you do the farts we're"
2127.7400000000002,2131.6600000000003," going to be involved in this so don't ask price. Oh, no, it's not what's farting around you and all"
2131.6600000000003,2137.1," of sudden it's like it's not funny anymore. Like you want to just punch him. Yeah, you know and"
2137.1,2141.9," then so it hit that point where I stopped laughing, you know and I was just like, you know,"
2141.9,2147.3399999999997," seriously like swearing out of the stuff and he was just choking, you know. I'm just like just spasmotically."
2147.74,2152.94," And then all of a sudden he stops laughing and then like about, you know, I'm trying to get the"
2152.94,2159.8199999999997," time lying down on this. It's really important. About 10 seconds later he goes, hey, I'm just going"
2159.8199999999997,2164.22, to drop you off at your parents because they lived like in between where my dorm was and in an arcade.
2164.2999999999997,2169.66, I remember I got I got to do this or that. I can't remember what he said. He had to do it immediately.
2169.66,2178.4599999999996," I do. I know what this is going. Corey, you shit your fucking pants. No, you're not dropping"
2178.4599999999996,2183.58, me off. You're going to my house. You're getting a grocery bag. You're putting your duty
2183.58,2188.62, drawers in them. You're throwing them in a trash and then you're going commander to the arcade because
2188.62,2193.8199999999997," you came all the way out here to get me. So okay, we go to the arcade that he did all this. I mean"
2193.82,2198.1400000000003, it was not enough. Just as I called we go the arcade and then so the the rad end of the story
2198.1400000000003,2203.6600000000003," is that and as soon as I called it, he was like, you can't tell Mike. You can't tell Mike. It was another"
2203.6600000000003,2210.78," friend in our clique. He was like, he was the town cryer even more so than I was. So I was supposed to"
2210.78,2215.98," tell him right now. Well, this is years later, this guy is care now. Like this is the"
2215.98,2221.98," care that he's now famous on the internet. Yeah, she had been his pants. So Mike is like, Mike's"
2222.06,2226.7," now an accomplished fine artist and it's funny because he sells his stuff at like, you know,"
2226.7,2231.82," Monterey and Carmel, you know, like not anymore. Sounds like that. Yeah. And immediately, so I told Mike"
2231.82,2237.26," and he drew up like about a six to eight panel comic book, um, comic story telling the whole, you know,"
2237.26,2241.9, retelling everything I just told and he water colored it and everything. It looked really nice.
2241.9,2246.3," And then, you know, weeks later in the context of all this hanging out, Mike passes it around to"
2246.3,2249.82," big group of us and it's like, yeah, you know, here's something that's just working on lately."
2249.98,2254.7000000000003, And then it gets to Corey. Corey looks immediately and understands what it happened. It just turns around
2254.7000000000003,2260.38," it and starts yelling, but it was, yeah. Wow. I think getting in the last of that one. No, we were"
2260.38,2265.02," all I think I did. I think it was again. Those are like a subsonic laugh from me. I just, I just think"
2265.02,2272.06," I don't think I want Corey visiting the GFW. I just have a, have a rack of depends ready to show up."
2272.06,2276.2200000000003," Yeah, you're right. This was probably a new low for us. I didn't think it could go any lower."
2276.22,2282.8599999999997," Yes, you might say. I think it can. I could tell one once he'd w fart story. If I'm,"
2282.8599999999997,2288.4599999999996," well, we're on the topic. And now is that we used to all eat lunch and the lunch room here at the"
2288.4599999999996,2293.5, Gloria's Zif Davis offices. We would all go for it for our various food and then we'd bring it back.
2293.5,2299.66, We'd also sit in the conference room and talk and often quite often there was a lot of burping going on
2299.66,2305.4199999999996," because they've Salvador who now works. Oh gosh, where does he work now? Intel Intel, you're right."
2305.5,2312.7000000000003," Hi, Dave. He used to burp quite a lot. He was a champion belt term. I mean, this guy would like,"
2312.7000000000003,2317.98," you know, he could shake the walls with these belges. And so people would try to compete with him,"
2317.98,2322.54, but there was no competing with Dave. And so we're all sitting around burping and at the time we had this
2322.54,2329.1800000000003, intern. We did not last a very long. We're all sitting there eating and burping. And this guy just
2329.18,2335.4199999999996," like, let's go a really loud fart. And so it's laughing and we're all like, dude, we're eating lunch."
2336.54,2342.22," But you know, and he's like, not it. No, no one heated that he laughed. But we were all mad."
2342.22,2346.8599999999997," And he's like, what? You guys are burping? We're like, it's not the same thing."
2346.8599999999997,2351.74, And what universe do you from? It depends. So it can be burps can be far worse than far to the
2351.74,2355.3399999999997, pens. I don't know. Not when you're eating lunch. That's the real topic of this episode.
2356.2200000000003,2360.6200000000003, Which is where? Which can be worse? Does this have to go in the in the iTunes right up? Yeah.
2360.6200000000003,2363.98," Yeah. Well, that's what we've got the cover on there. Save the board."
2363.98,2368.06," It's not Ryan. You think he worked? You know, I think he's natural. I think maybe he should"
2368.06,2372.1400000000003, just open a sexual poll. Okay. I'm going to bring this back to something a little more serious. Okay.
2372.1400000000003,2377.7400000000002, Because we've we've hit the skids here. Yeah. This is an article from kataku.com. And they were
2377.8199999999997,2383.3399999999997, quoting game developer magazine. The headline is developers Roland in Benjamin's
2384.22,2389.9799999999996, which I believe is slang for money. They are money. I believe you don't fall. Call now.
2389.9799999999996,2397.58," Benjamin's. Okay. Industry mega. That's so actually. Well, I was just realizing how I mean, I"
2397.58,2401.58," guess when a video game site used it, you know how played out it is. But think about how long it was that"
2401.58,2406.3799999999997," like the moment, puffy released. Oh, about the benchy means baby like that. Yeah."
2406.46,2411.1800000000003," Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I actually I was thinking that when I was in Los Angeles, that was back"
2411.1800000000003,2415.58, weekend. My friend heard his pants on the way to their cave. I was never seeing Benjamin's way back then.
2416.46,2421.7400000000002, I was in the suburbs of LA and two times this weekend. I heard middle-aged men and when I say
2421.7400000000002,2427.1," middle-aged, I mean even older than me. So there are probably, you know, late 40s or 50s. I heard these"
2427.1,2433.34," like balding middle-aged white guys. One guy said, my bad. And another guy said, I feel you."
2433.42,2437.58," That's like, okay, neither of these faces. I've ever seen one of it. I've seen."
2437.58,2444.6200000000003," I've seen a lot of stuff. Yes. I feel you. That was a bad pot. I'm zero. Oh, man. That kills me."
2445.1800000000003,2452.78," My bad. And then he punches it in dog. Okay. So that's Benjamin. So, let's see. Game developer"
2452.78,2457.82, magazine came up with an average annual income for various jobs in the U.S. Games industry.
2458.78,2468.54," In 2006, here are some of the salaries that were made job by job in the gaming industry."
2468.54,2475.1000000000004," Programmers were raking in an average of 80,886 dollars a year."
2475.98,2480.38," Artists 65,107 dollars. It's a lot of Todd McFarlane figures."
2481.02,2492.7000000000003," That is. Game designers 61,538. Production personnel 77,131 production personnel would be what?"
2492.7000000000003,2499.58," Producer's, I guess. I mean, they've already seen the designers and programmers."
2499.58,2504.62," That don't have a production personnel or the guest producer. Producer's, producer's, yes."
2504.8599999999997,2511.98," QA weighed down to 37,000. Is there any its quality? Right. Which, which there you go. That says"
2511.98,2518.46," lot right there. But no, it doesn't say how much they value. It says like how in demand the actual"
2518.46,2524.14," employees are. I mean, you don't need much of an education for QA. I mean, you do need education."
2524.14,2527.98," So, don't give me wrong. But you don't need the same education that the programmer knows. Exactly."
2527.98,2531.74," No, you don't. So, don't take that bad QA to a love you. But I'm just saying you don't. I'm"
2531.74,2535.9799999999996," clearly, if you had the same education as the programmer, you'd be programming. Probably be programming."
2535.9799999999996,2546.22," Right. No. Or we'd have better games. Audio, audio employees were averaging 69,935,000."
2546.9399999999996,2555.18," And rated highest ranked highest business and legal 95,596. So, programmers were second."
2555.2599999999998,2560.22," And he run down there. It was business and legal 95, programmers 80."
2560.22,2565.02," So, interesting designer that designed this on your low-f program. Well, yeah, what that first"
2565.02,2568.8599999999997," mechanism, I've heard that, but then also kind of said, well, they're the ones that require the least"
2568.8599999999997,2575.02," like visual training on that list. Like if you got like a designer next to a programmer, obviously"
2575.02,2578.54," the programmer has gone through a lot more schooling, specifically for programming, you know, that a designer"
2578.54,2583.1," would have gone through, specifically for design. Maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe people are going through"
2583.18,2587.8199999999997," ten years of design school, but I doubt it. It's still pretty good money for pretty much all those"
2588.7799999999997,2594.38," all those titles except for QA, which really is kind of an entry level job as a game tester."
2594.38,2597.1," Those are all, I'm sure, were those averages or were those like those were average."
2599.1,2603.18," And as we were talking before we came on air here, the sad truth is that"
2603.9,2609.66," for a place like California, where we're podcasting from those salaries actually aren't that high"
2609.66,2614.22, for the cost of living here. Right. Sadly. Like when when you read off the when I read the numbers on
2614.22,2618.22," that, I didn't say, well, they're not all one and then the Benjamin's, I don't know, the headline."
2618.22,2622.46, This could talk is not can't be based in San Francisco. I don't know why I could. Because you definitely
2622.46,2626.14," wouldn't be considered in 60,000 roll and anything. No, that's why I can't. One's been your"
2626.14,2630.8599999999997," apartment. Yeah, if you're rolling in pennies, I mean, when I mean for it to put it perspective,"
2630.8599999999997,2635.42," I mean, wherever the listeners are, I mean, like 300,000 here, we'll get you if you're lucky."
2635.5,2639.9," Like if you're, if you're in a real estate, this will get you like a condo, right?"
2640.62,2644.06," With one room. You're looking at it, at least. Yeah, that's your life. You're not even a good"
2644.06,2648.62," good one. Not even a good one. Not even a good one. No, I single bedroom in like a not even a good"
2648.62,2655.7400000000002," area. You're not going to get a house in the Bay Area, you know, and any anywhere close to San Francisco"
2655.7400000000002,2661.1800000000003," were Berkeley for under one and a half half a million at the point. Like I was looking at,"
2661.1800000000003,2664.94," I've actually been looking at this kind of stuff and like, yeah, you need at least a million for"
2664.94,2669.82," a decent house. It's kind of sad. Yeah. So it's, you know, you need a geographical distribution"
2669.82,2672.62," of where these jobs are. I mean, we assume a lot of them are in these like,"
2672.62,2677.02," they're more expensive metropolitan areas. Some we know North Carolina, right? I mean,"
2677.02,2680.62," exactly. Well, I don't know what the percentage break down is. So you guys, the trick is to get a"
2680.62,2684.06," job in the game industry. One of these areas where they'll cost a living hasn't jumped yet. I mean,"
2684.06,2688.78," but if I was making, you know, even the QA salary and Buffalo, New York where I'm from, like, I"
2688.78,2693.58," mean, like, yeah, right by a house. The great thing is that a lot of these game companies, especially the"
2693.66,2698.38," bigger ones, I mean, even for QA, they do a good job of taking care of their employees, you know,"
2698.38,2702.7," we go and visit these companies and they have really nice setups for a lot of them. I mean,"
2702.7,2706.94, that's because they expect them to work long hours. But I've been to plenty of companies where
2707.5,2713.34," excuse me, where they'll have like, in how chefs will make lunch for everybody all day. I mean,"
2713.34,2719.02," every day, that kind of thing or gyms right on premises. I mean, basically, so they never want"
2719.1,2723.5," to be a studio with a, with a develop. I mean, if I were to guess, if you were to take any one of these"
2723.5,2731.1," jobs and kind of find the equivalent at a non game place, like it was okay, okay, I'm a programmer"
2731.1,2736.78," for, you know, some Capcom studio. And oh, no, I'm a programmer for Oracle. I've been a Oracle guy."
2736.78,2741.02," We'd be making a lot more. Because I think it's a supply and demand. Well, hey, we can do that frankly"
2741.02,2749.9," with games, quote unquote, journalism. Can't we? You know, the average writer at a, or editor at a"
2749.9,2757.42, magazine likely to make more at a non gaming place than they are at gaming. I can speak from experience.
2758.7,2765.42," Especially, especially if you consider gaming journalism a subset or offshoot of tech journalism."
2766.38,2771.7400000000002, And it is supply and demand thing because writing in the games industry is way more sexy than
2771.7400000000002,2777.02," working at a database company. Yeah. I kind of think of us as sort of like one step below PE teacher,"
2777.02,2782.3," you know, they got the like those who can't do teach those who can't teach T to PE. I think those who"
2782.3,2786.54," can't teach PE. Yeah, review games for a lesson. I think that's kind of what I work. Yeah, well,"
2786.54,2792.54," the put in perspective, the, I think the drivers of Bart, the local Bay Area Rapid Transit System,"
2792.54,2798.62," like a little over 60 K a year. Really. Wow. Wow. And yet my trains late every day. Yes,"
2798.62,2803.1, just just something to think about. Can't my drivers and they don't even drive it. Do they?
2803.1,2806.46, They're pressing like this. Press there's one big boat. Go. I've seen it.
2808.94,2813.2599999999998, And they still make get that right. I don't know. It might be really hard. Maybe they have to like
2813.2599999999998,2818.14, dodge the house all the time. I don't even notice it. Need to play the Bart driver's seeming
2818.14,2826.22," to learn some respect. Yeah. Yeah. Turn that throttle up, throttle down. But what else do we have this week?"
2828.54,2834.2999999999997, We had the ball. We had to sign up. Big topic. What was the big topic? Big topic was the evolution of
2834.2999999999997,2839.98," a multiplayer gaming. Oh, yeah. And that or it was kind of for me, like when I brought it up, it was"
2839.98,2844.62, more of like just the way that we play games socially. Yeah. How that's changed over the years.
2845.58,2850.2999999999997," So second on, the social gaming experience. So you want me to know me to start in one phase"
2850.2999999999997,2855.3399999999997, and or do a quick quick through the years for me and then compare and contrast with your guys
2855.3399999999997,2861.66, experience. Yeah. I feel you. Okay. So what I was thinking was just interesting because it is all
2861.66,2867.66," about the Benjamin. I mean, I've always been, you know, who do you want to play games with other people"
2867.66,2873.18," whenever possible? Uh-huh. And you started off, um, you know, there's an arcade experience where"
2874.14,2880.06," that silent rivalry with people you don't know. Uh-huh. Jocke for elbow space, you know,"
2880.06,2883.66," fighting games. Even before that, like, you are kung fu, not your kung fu single player, but like"
2883.66,2888.06," a karate champ. The thing that you had to do is you had to slap down the quarter, put the quarter"
2888.06,2893.5," up as soon as the guy was flailing as if to say, yeah, you're done. Yeah. I got moving there or like"
2893.5,2897.8199999999997," or they wait for you. There's that other thing too. We're like, uh, they're hoping that you come in,"
2897.8199999999997,2901.4199999999996, like they're losing and they're like put your quarter and put your quarter in. But then you just like
2901.42,2904.86," wait and then they like die and then they got to put another quarter and they want to play you,"
2904.86,2910.54," you know, like that was a whole new year. But definitely some jungle law there. But so I mean,"
2910.54,2914.14," we had that sort of thing. But then also, I mean, when I was really, I know of course,"
2914.14,2917.9," we're playing, you know, straight multiple multiplayer games, you know, sports. It was made like on the"
2917.9,2923.98," tendos, you know, and Atari will Atari and combat sports and stuff like that. But I just always remember"
2923.98,2929.98," like, also playing single player games, but the taking turns with people and I didn't have any"
2930.06,2933.98," siblings that lived with, but even with friends. And all the way up through like, you know,"
2933.98,2938.38," super Metroid, Mel, your solid one that came out, resin evil when it first came out. And you take"
2938.38,2943.5, turns and you all kind of like watch one another and kind of hope that the other person dies. So you
2943.5,2947.58," can get your turn all right. But at the same time, you're like, or you just might be fatigued with this"
2947.58,2951.42," part and you don't want to do it, but you still want to like feel like you could treat me to the"
2951.42,2956.7," getting through it. So you never root for your friends. Oh, I would. So then we'd help. But then you"
2956.7,2960.8599999999997," get mad too. If like, there'd always be that one friend. And he'd want to like try the dumbest"
2960.8599999999997,2966.46," solutions to everything. And it was like the, the dude played Castlevania 2 for Nintendo. And that"
2966.46,2971.4199999999996," game actually is put together that way, but like, we're in different life. So, you know, it's it's"
2971.4199999999996,2975.18, clear to everyone else in the room that all you need to do is you've got like whatever the star shaped
2975.18,2980.3799999999997," key and you need to put it in the star shaped, you know, locked a door or whatever. But he wants,"
2980.3799999999997,2985.02," but no, he wants to go back and look in the sewer and see if he needs to get some kind of acid"
2985.18,2990.54," to cover it with and pass it through a few, you know, subsequent phases, but there's always that dude."
2992.38,2999.9," Where am I going with this? Yeah, yeah, and then like, I don't know, and then for me, then it just seemed like,"
2999.9,3006.14," I mean, the big, of course, the, the big street fire came to home units and stuff. And then that,"
3006.14,3009.74," you know, brought the competitive stuff back. And then that was around the same time that Doom"
3009.74,3013.5," was in the dorm rooms. So everyone's, you know, gathered around for that on land."
3015.34,3019.18," And, and then that was really cool. But then it just, it was perfect timing for me because like I always"
3019.18,3023.74, got the most enjoyment at least with someone else there to play and that's when like online start
3023.74,3033.34," taking off. So it's great and I got to do, got to do all that and uh, yeah, yeah, that I"
3033.34,3039.98," burnt it. And then, um, and then, um, and then it's just like now it's like it just seems like the"
3039.98,3043.74, great place for it to be going is that you have more and more co-op games and just like increased
3043.74,3047.8199999999997," emphasis on co-op. And I mean, I'm really glad when it's there, like in gear's of war, which is,"
3047.8199999999997,3053.3399999999997," you know, for being such a big, you know, prominent release and co-op having a huge part in that"
3054.14,3057.74," EAs army of two, which is coming out. Yeah, but it does have a lot of console, but"
3057.74,3062.54, but it's an area is coming for PC as well. But doesn't it piss you off that like you see so many
3062.54,3067.4199999999996," console games, even like online console games that have co-op and yet like the co-op on PC games,"
3067.4199999999996,3073.5," there's a few and far between comparison. But of course, that's the whole appeal of MMOs, right?"
3073.58,3077.66," Right. You don't really play. I'm sure on, but that is, that is the appeal because we're"
3077.66,3083.34," killing these monsters in a group with other people. But the only thing I'm saying is like, you know,"
3083.34,3088.06," MMOs are distinct kind of like gameplay. Yeah. I mean, like if I want to get into a shooter with"
3088.06,3094.46," somebody or like a single player campaign of whatever shooters that's up next, be able to do that."
3094.46,3098.86," Yeah, you're right. It would be great if there was more of that on the PC and I don't get it either."
3098.86,3103.02, Why? I don't know. There's one get. One thing I haven't really gotten into on console
3103.1,3107.82," yet is co-op online. I will still do co-op like same room with the other person,"
3107.82,3111.34, which is why I was kind of disappointing when we were talking about crackdown a couple weeks ago and
3111.34,3116.14," someone said like, yeah, that's co-op, but not split screen. That was so great for me, is it?"
3116.14,3119.98," Had to co-op. Yeah. But I still want the like, doesn't split screen co-op,"
3119.98,3126.38," drive you nuts though? Yeah, really. I mean, it doesn't. Like I mean, I'm going back to golden. Yeah."
3126.38,3130.94," Well, like back in the college days, like we just used to sit around the TV, like golden"
3131.02,3134.46, I've been like for days. I know. I just played golden. I and I'd be so tempted to cheat all the time
3134.46,3137.82," because like they would be like these little windows. I'm like, check it out at the top right now."
3137.82,3142.46," Oh, that was part of the game. I know. It just tempted to cheat means you did cheat. Yeah, yeah. I did cheat."
3142.46,3147.34," That was very much part of it. Like knowing where the other people were, made it a very different game."
3148.06,3152.38," But yeah, I co-op great, but split screen co-op don't go away."
3154.14,3159.5," I'm like the opposite. Really? Is it's like, in fact, I think, you know, when my friends do come over,"
3160.46,3166.7, what happens is we won't play video games together because there would be we'd have more fun playing the games we want to play at home together.
3167.42,3172.94," You know, online. I still see it. I still get a lot of value out of the everyone's in the same room scenario."
3172.94,3178.14," And depends. The game's changed. Well, on a playing slow caliber, you know, right over a firefighter or something."
3178.14,3186.14, Right. I think you're not playing these points as ever are the ones I had at CGW with a group of people all in the same run playing a shooter.
3186.7799999999997,3192.46, The the same land game. It was it was mostly half-life one and different maps team portraits.
3195.3399999999997,3200.8599999999997, I think we would have had the same we would have had a lot of fun if we were all at our separate homes playing these maps.
3200.8599999999997,3204.8599999999997, But the fact that we are all in the same room yelling at each other and giving each other shit.
3204.8599999999997,3209.2599999999998, Yeah. Was at least half of what made it. I totally agree with that. I still would bring that back.
3209.2599999999998,3212.3799999999997, We need to like designate like blow the shit out of each other. It's carrying.
3212.46,3217.58," But it's interesting. I mean, we can have that experience because we all work together in a magazine, right about games."
3217.58,3223.98," Everyone has to go to a land party. Right. And you know, those are more popular in other countries."
3223.98,3228.46, Yeah. Have that kind of thing. Right. It's interesting that it hasn't translated here as well.
3228.46,3233.1800000000003," Because you wouldn't think that that would be so much fun. I think we do. I mean, we still do have."
3233.1800000000003,3237.98, We have a few cyber cafes. Yeah. Depending on where you go places where people go.
3237.98,3239.9, Right. So that's a niche.
3239.9,3243.82, But it's the same reason why our kids don't do aren't as big here. They aren't the parts of the world.
3243.82,3248.86," Because I mean, everyone's got a good computer at home or everyone's got a console or a nice home theater TV."
3248.86,3251.42, They want to sit in front of. We're all just at our own homes now.
3252.46,3257.1800000000003," I would totally like the social part of it. But it's just like, yeah, where, when and where. You know,"
3257.9,3263.02," I mean, I don't want to go to me on. I don't want to go play counter strike. One point six over at the cyber cafe."
3263.02,3266.2200000000003," You're right. No, I don't. I don't either. Right. So even though we don't like it."
3266.22,3269.4199999999996, I'm going to bust with actually. I'm going to go to a cyber cafe.
3269.4199999999996,3272.14, Yeah. I want to play with people I know like in my house.
3272.14,3277.8999999999996, Yeah. I think those like like those are my greatest memories playing multiplayer games.
3277.8999999999996,3280.4599999999996, It's like the college days when we put with seven other people.
3281.1,3285.5, And would set up a elaborate land system system play and rise to the triad or whatever.
3285.5,3289.66, Right. Rise to the triad. I remember that one. I was a fun land game.
3289.66,3291.66, I wish the Wii is bringing it back though.
3292.22,3294.3799999999997, Yep. That's the whole basis of the game.
3294.94,3297.6600000000003, Yeah. The Wii is the war people win the same room.
3297.6600000000003,3301.6600000000003, But you're going to say rise to try. I have this coming to a. That would be. Wow.
3302.46,3305.98, Yeah. Rise to the triad for the Wii. I don't know what that means. I have no idea. I just don't
3305.98,3310.94, I need to remind. I'm all for the for the co-op online. I know a lot more companies do it.
3310.94,3315.7400000000002," Yeah, I like it. I can crack down. I actually, I wouldn't have touched it. Had it not been for that"
3316.2200000000003,3320.86," option in that game. Really. I mean, that's what a track you can do. I was like the same reason for the"
3320.94,3325.02, very same reasons we would play back then together. It's like a cutscene comes on and we're both
3325.02,3329.82, making fun of it or like any I mean just the social experience of like commenting the whole time.
3329.82,3335.42," The peanut gallery. You know, I mean don't character lines and we're talking to make it fun of those"
3335.42,3341.58, or peat knows or like crack down. You go into you go from the equivalent of Mexico land to Russia land to
3341.58,3346.46," you know, China land it just making fun of like how like stereotypical and just the whole thing is."
3346.46,3350.3, I mean it's just it's so much more fun that way. I've been sitting there in my own and living room.
3350.38,3354.6200000000003," Like, you know, you can go use the computer hunt. I'm just going to be out here and then in the"
3354.6200000000003,3359.5800000000004," living room all you hear is like, hey, don't do that on my countryman. I mean, like whatever,"
3360.6200000000003,3367.42," you know, I mean that's cracked out the moment you started. It's like in your face there. Yeah."
3369.42,3377.6600000000003," All right, any of you? Well, any more? Did you ever have the phase where there's also back in college"
3377.66,3384.22," for like super Nintendo era, maybe yeah, I was playing Final Fantasy 3, which is Final Fantasy 6 and Japan."
3384.22,3391.02, Whatever. I would be playing it and everyone like maybe like eight people would want me to
3391.66,3395.8999999999996," want me to play it. They would like say, hey, can you play Final Fantasy 3 and I be like, oh, I don't want"
3395.8999999999996,3399.3399999999997," to play Final Fantasy 3, but all right. And then there would be like a bunch of people watching this"
3399.3399999999997,3404.7799999999997, freaking game. Just watching you play. Yeah. And they would do that with like graphic adventures. I think like the
3404.86,3409.02, dig we had a big audience that like I couldn't play unless certain people were there to watch.
3409.02,3415.1000000000004," Yeah, they all ran where they all stoned half of them. Yeah, that's what they said. That"
3415.1000000000004,3419.34," there were, yeah, totally. There was like super Metroid was that way. There's much people that"
3419.34,3424.2200000000003," like didn't want to play, but they all wanted to watch, you know, that that hasn't happened since then."
3424.2200000000003,3428.3," Very distinct year, maybe, or that was like the case. I'm just going to think what I've got"
3428.38,3432.7000000000003," built. You just put a lot of bomber man. I remember when I was in college, I think it was all about"
3432.7000000000003,3438.94," NHL. We used to have like huge huge tournaments. Never got into those. Yeah. Dude, you live,"
3438.94,3443.26, you lived like near Buffalo. Sega Genesis? It's like all about that's all about the snow and ice.
3443.6600000000003,3449.1800000000003," Yeah. That's why I'm not in Buffalo. The sameers man, come on. It was all Missile Command and Pinball"
3449.1800000000003,3455.02," for me and my generation down at the Yola and Archie. Yeah, I'm not the old Peter Rea. Yep."
3455.1,3461.42, Down at Silverball Archie and Berkeley. Yeah. I was a wee one getting my my fingers pinched in that
3461.42,3468.06, track ball. Remember it? It would do that. Oh yeah. I was a good guy. I was a good guy.
3468.06,3471.34," It's a show in the shirt on your phone. On your little command, that shit hurts. Yeah, that leaves"
3471.34,3475.42," like a scar. I think I still have one. Yeah, that was a tempest. The thing yet, the spin and"
3475.42,3480.22," tempest. Yeah, my hand used to get sore for the next time. I used to, yeah, that's why I got sore."
3480.22,3483.58, I used to play the shirt at that local piece of area and like I used to play the shirt at a
3483.58,3487.58," tempest at the local piece area. I have like that, but in crested layer like pizza grease."
3487.58,3491.8199999999997," Yeah, just sludge just around the dial and I'm like, tempest is one of those games. It's never"
3491.8199999999997,3497.74," converted well to any of the other, you know, every time one of these compilation packs come out"
3497.74,3502.2999999999997, for whatever console machine they got tempest on there. I'm not going to play tempest with a game pad.
3502.2999999999997,3506.54, Sorry. I need to totally knob singing. That's true. I remember the what was the one for the
3506.54,3513.74, Tart Jaguar. The version tempest. The tempest. The tempest. Okay. Yeah. That was a great game.
3513.74,3519.18," Tempest. Oh, yeah. That was returning to retro now. I was gaming. It was great. You better watch."
3519.18,3523.5, That was perfect. That was just like colored lines like spinning around. This is all
3523.5,3527.66, scarier. All the fancy 3D graphics. You should have done it all week. We've been getting emails
3528.22,3535.34, internally for they want us to go and tape some video segments for like what is it a show about game tap?
3536.3,3539.34," Yeah. And I was making fun of it. I was like, I don't want to do that because"
3540.1400000000003,3544.78," that's the equivalent of us being like, you know, in the time life, uh, music compilation commercial."
3544.78,3548.2200000000003," I mean, they get like, you could forget this band. Oh, and then they play a little field."
3548.2200000000003,3551.34, We united in.
3551.9,3556.46," And then they show some couple walking out of the beach. Oh, I remember when we play a main girl."
3556.46,3560.54," Like, yeah. So they basically want to turn into those people for video games."
3560.54,3563.02," I'm going to do on that right now. We already. Yes. Well, that's what the point is."
3563.02,3568.06, Yeah. We are. We're doing it. We stole the video. All my mind. Tempest. Final fantasy 3.
3568.06,3572.86," All here. I mean, the hot. You get these games, but uh, maybe this is for you, Jeff and your"
3572.86,3578.06," new, we found, uh, pitchman. Yeah. But like, I mean, this is the first time where you get all these"
3578.06,3583.66," games together in one place. I mean, before you use to track these down of an individual in eBay,"
3583.66,3588.94, so you're living it up with old game hardware systems. But now you're playing them all all together.
3589.58,3595.98, You're right. We should advertise for this. Why don't anywhere else? Game tap.
3596.54,3602.54," Okay. I got seven max to date. Wow. Actually, I hate to say, but there is one thing I'm appreciating"
3602.54,3609.26, because I could not get I. 76 to run in Windows lately. A classic. And I and it runs there.
3610.3,3614.14, So sorry. I hate to hate to hate to. Interesting. Classic game that I. 76.
3614.46,3621.3399999999997," Okay. What else we got? And now, hello. Yeah. Energy low here today."
3621.3399999999997,3624.3799999999997, That about GFW podcast. Five minutes.
3625.2599999999998,3629.66," Give me a minute. We can't do another five. We can't lie. Oh, minutes."
3629.66,3633.74," We're going to talk about it. We have a couple new. Yeah, we talk about the vanguard thing very"
3633.74,3639.58, quickly. I kind of hate the batch vanguard at this point in time. Little bit. A little bit like
3639.58,3644.14, kicking the retarded kid. Sorry. Not retarded. What do you mean we thought it?
3644.94,3654.22, Intimately able differently. Abel. It's slow. Slow learner. Flash. Only because we we gave a kind of
3654.22,3660.14," a harsh review. Which is a little sad. I was rooting for this game. You know, we had a"
3660.14,3665.66, depth Butler here in the studio quite a while ago. And we had a great conversation with him about
3665.74,3673.5," the game and the last review. Not so good. I will say however, MMOs. They can always, you know,"
3674.22,3679.3399999999997, this is this is the first time this game will evolve. We will keep looking at it. It could get better.
3680.06,3685.02," That said, they just announced a big change. That's not implemented yet, correct? It's a"
3685.02,3691.2599999999998," synonypid. It's a test. Yeah. Yeah. The fact they're even testing it is telling. Go ahead, Joe."
3691.5,3698.94," Right. As posted on vanguard's website, uh, uh, current changes are you will no longer leave a"
3698.94,3705.34," corpse behind when you die. Instead, you will drop an essence. You will no longer leave items."
3705.34,3710.6200000000003, So I'm not on your essence. As since this were a turn a large amount of experience upon retrieval.
3711.7400000000002,3719.1800000000003," So, um, in the amount of experience lost when you die has been decreased. Um, so, and that is all"
3719.2599999999998,3724.8599999999997, couched in the explanation that these changes are part of our ongoing plan to improve your experience
3724.8599999999997,3733.1, while playing vanguard. So the point is no more corpse runs or no more corpse runs. And the
3733.1,3738.2999999999997," symbolically big thing about that is of course, as the corpse runs were one of the big. I wouldn't say"
3738.2999999999997,3743.4199999999996," selling points. That's taking too far, but that was one of the kind of the big philosophical thing. Right."
3743.4199999999996,3748.8599999999997, It was kind of a statement by having a corpse run in an MMO at this point in time after
3748.94,3754.78, the release of wow that was saying we want our game to be more hardcore. Our game is not going to be
3754.78,3759.58," as easy as wow. If you're going to die, you're going to have to pay for it. And we think that"
3759.58,3765.42," gamers are going to like that because wow is too easy. If you're, if you think wow's too easy,"
3765.42,3769.98," if you're sick of wow, have we got the game for you? Well, vanguard's only been out now for"
3770.78,3777.34, a couple months. And they're now already backing off or they appear as if they are going to back off
3777.34,3783.42, with the with this announcement of one of those big points. So of course some message boards are
3783.42,3788.86, all aligned with this change and what it all means. And we're bringing up here for the same reason
3788.86,3798.6200000000003, because it does seem to point to that they are perhaps backing off that idea that maybe they're
3798.6200000000003,3806.46," saying, eh, okay, well, what we said about it being people wanting a harder game? Well, maybe they"
3806.54,3811.5," don't want it that quite that hard. And so it seems kind of like a big retreat to me,"
3812.94,3817.18," especially the early in the game to not stand by it. Well, do you think that it was a big"
3817.18,3820.78," feature in the first place? I mean, it's like saying, hey, you pay us 20 bucks a month. We'll kick you"
3820.78,3824.86," in the nuts. I'm not going to put a lot of people. I mean, yeah, that's well, it's for the response"
3824.86,3828.78," you're right. I'm from other people. Exactly. And that's what they're saying. Okay, well, I guess we're"
3828.78,3835.58," going to stop kicking you in the nuts. But which you're right, I mean, for a lot of us, including me,"
3835.66,3839.5," that's like a good thing. Oh, good. You're going to stop kicking me in the nuts. Maybe I'll play"
3839.5,3843.58," me out. Actually, I don't really like being kicked in the nuts. Right. It happened to me once in"
3843.58,3850.22, seventh grade and it hurt. So so maybe now I'll try your game. But it does. But then that brings up
3850.22,3854.46," the, you know, the issue is like, okay, well, are they just being more wow like now?"
3856.7799999999997,3861.34, Yeah. Yeah. And is there is an end does that then mean that there is no alternative to being
3861.34,3867.82," wow like can can you have an MMO that's harder? I have, then succeed. I think the financial"
3867.82,3872.54," realities just kind of the bottom line there is like, okay, hardcore is wonderful for the hard"
3872.54,3876.3," group people, but they're in enough of them. And it looks like most people aren't hard for enough"
3876.3,3880.1400000000003," to want to go to get their corpse every time. So, you're going to point out, even online."
3880.86,3885.9," Even online is pretty hard core, right? And how are they? Are they still growing, like, you know,"
3886.2200000000003,3891.82," they claim that they are. They're up over 160,000. All things that you're in."
3891.82,3896.7000000000003," Your causes on this podcast. Well, they also have, they're also an alternative to the fantasy"
3896.7000000000003,3899.9, and the whole thing. Because they're the gazillion of those things. So you also get the bonus of
3899.9,3904.62," that being spaceship MMO. Right. But there's a couple like, you know, alternate MMOs and not many"
3904.62,3909.26," of them have been a success like auto assault. It's a great example of what was pretty, it was pretty"
3909.26,3913.6600000000003," good. There's some, the fundamental flaws with it. Well, I think that's the most saline issue here"
3913.74,3919.74," is that, you know, if you're going to have a fantasy MMO that's the words and elves and whatever,"
3920.8599999999997,3925.58," you know, what are you going to do to differentiate yourself from, wow, well, in Vanguard's case,"
3925.58,3930.46, it's starting to make it harder. But now they're backing off the hardness part. So what is there
3930.46,3936.7," that? Harder and high fantasy MMOs are like, she'll act action figures. And I'm being"
3936.7799999999997,3941.58," more talkative. Certainly there's plenty of, plenty of Vanguard fans probably will come on and say,"
3941.58,3946.9399999999996," it's not just that there's a lot of good new features that wow, never had. And I get that, I do."
3946.9399999999996,3953.5," So you don't have to send many, no. But I do think that that it is, this is a significant change."
3954.22,3960.2999999999997, And I would like to see people come on our forum and defend this game to us.
3961.8999999999996,3965.18," They have a lot of good ideas. They do have, this game has a lot of good ideas."
3965.2599999999998,3969.66, And that's really on in it. That's the thing with it. It's always been like great idea.
3969.66,3973.98," Let's see it happen. And then, so that's the waiting."
3974.94,3978.46," I'm not giving up on it yet. No. Despite it. I'm a boes can change. That's one of the,"
3979.3399999999997,3983.1," if anything, that's what they do really well. Like Star Wars Galaxy, right?"
3983.1,3988.7799999999997," They complete. They completed that game. They said, okay, you're right. We didn't want to admit it"
3988.7799999999997,3992.7," at first. What do you mean, you're right? Our game sucks. We're going to take it all away."
3992.7,3996.62, And we're going to re-release it. And now here it is. And it sucks worse.
3996.62,4000.7," And you know, okay, maybe that didn't work. Well, they first showed that to us. We thought it was going to be good."
4000.7,4005.3399999999997," We did. Well, what, Galaxy? The second, the new Galaxy. Well, they rolled that out,"
4005.3399999999997,4008.7, like hastily without proper balance. Again. Yeah.
4008.7,4012.14," Yeah. Well, that's one of the greatest issues that we did in the year."
4012.14,4015.98," Mamo is whoops, too fast. Well, and of course, that was part of Vanguard's problem."
4015.98,4019.1, But are there any of the Mamo's that kind of made that total turnaround that had a
4019.1,4023.74," crap release. And then kind of rallied and came up with a good game afterwards. I mean,"
4023.74,4027.9," I think, and I could online my closet. That was the one that came to my mind. It had a very"
4027.9,4032.7799999999997," crap release. And I felt like it got better over time. And I was in, yeah, I gave up on it. Like,"
4032.7799999999997,4037.9," because I started playing that one right at the beginning. No, no, no, no. Never went back."
4037.9,4044.46," From what I've heard, again, you've online when it first came out was not very good in a lot of ways."
4045.42,4049.02," And certainly in the time life played, it's improved."
4049.02,4055.9," I think, you know, releasing a game. And this is so not even not even anything beyond"
4055.9,4060.78, the most dull sort of point. So I really shouldn't have to make it. But releasing a game when it's
4060.78,4067.9," not ready is such an incredibly short, short, cited dumb move. I mean, how do you ever get past"
4067.9,4074.3," that reputation that your game is not done and that it, you know, that it's not working?"
4074.3,4078.94," I mean, how would you like to work on a game? You know, if that's you for all those years."
4078.94,4084.54, And then instead of waiting that extra bit of time to make sure it's right to put it out and
4084.54,4088.78," have all have anybody says after all the work you did, boy, they really should have waited till that"
4088.78,4094.78," thing was done. And what a fucking waste. Right. But I guess what, I mean, I don't, I don't have the"
4094.86,4097.820000000001," insights here. I'm just, I want to hear that fly on the wall as they kind of, because I know that"
4097.820000000001,4102.780000000001," like Vanguard's been around for a long time and it's just a couple hands. So I guess what I'm wondering is,"
4102.780000000001,4106.62," you know, at what point did, you know, they, when was the first time we saw this game three,"
4106.62,4112.06, four years ago? That about right? That's about right. Yeah. Yeah.
4112.06,4115.820000000001," Yeah, years ago. Right. And I'm just like, in all that time, you wonder like, you know, at what"
4115.820000000001,4119.58," point that, you know, like when they finally, when Sony finally said, uh, screw it, you're shipping this"
4119.58,4123.900000000001," game, what did schedule say, oh, no, we need another two years. Well, I'm sure they probably did."
4124.86,4129.259999999999, I can't imagine. I wasn't there. This is complete speculating. Right. But I can't imagine anybody
4129.259999999999,4133.099999999999," was going like, yeah, let's put it out there. Well, Brad McQuay didn't even said like when it came"
4133.099999999999,4136.94," out, he's like, bringing just ran on the funding and we find out to reality is that we have to"
4136.94,4142.3," have to release this thing now. Right. He more said more or less said like, S. I mean, it's already,"
4142.3,4146.7, we're sorry. Yeah. I think he more or less did. And I'm sure they've been frantic to improve this
4146.7,4151.58," thing since. Right. Since large, but maybe this is part of it. Maybe they would have reached this"
4151.58,4156.22," conclusion before releasing it. Had they beta tested longer, had they been given the opportunity"
4156.22,4163.42," to beta test on this, right? Don't know. We don't know. Well, so we end on that high note,"
4164.22,4169.66," that we just don't know shit. Yeah. Great. How are you doing over there, Sean? The Sean's"
4169.66,4175.58, time to sounds like rockin' it was on music. The pop in his head. He's this in a red dog and
4175.58,4181.58," he's one of the what is listening to. Yeah. I feel you though. Yeah, dog. Okay. I think we're done."
4182.62,4189.26, Thanks for listening to the Ryan show all by GFW radio. Whatever the hell we talked about this week.
