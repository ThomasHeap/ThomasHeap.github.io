33.0,35.0, We have two special guests.
35.0,37.0, One who's never been on before.
37.0,41.0," However, he was going to be on on the day that Armagging shut down."
41.0,43.0, So be very afraid.
43.0,44.0," Yeah, true."
44.0,45.0, So thanks for that.
45.0,46.0, Got about that.
46.0,47.0, But should we do?
47.0,48.0, Should we let them introduce themselves?
48.0,49.0," You just go on, guys."
49.0,51.0," Yeah, I'll just go to the studio."
51.0,53.0, This is Julian Murdoch.
53.0,54.0," Hi, Julian."
54.0,59.0, Julian is one of the hosts of gamers with jobs.
59.0,61.0," A fine, fine podcast."
61.0,63.0," Well, thank you for saying so, sir."
63.0,64.0, One that you've actually been on.
64.0,66.0, Those are my favorite episodes.
66.0,69.0, We blame you for all of our success.
69.0,70.0, Yeah.
70.0,72.0," Yeah, I think it's Ken Levine who's our sponsor."
72.0,73.0, What's your success?
73.0,74.0, Probably.
74.0,75.0, Yeah.
75.0,79.0," Also on today, are Ryan Scott."
79.0,81.0, Robert Ashwood.
81.0,82.0, Sean Elliott.
82.0,83.0, Hi.
83.0,84.0, Hello.
84.0,88.0," So Robert and Sean, you guys were at a protest today."
88.0,92.0," Yeah, we woke up today and we're like today."
92.0,95.0, We're going to end this war.
95.0,101.0, So we met up with our fellow compatriots near the Ubisoft office in South Park.
101.0,103.0, Are we allowed to say that?
103.0,106.0, Are we allowed to say the word Ubisoft here at Sift Davis now?
106.0,107.0, There we can.
107.0,108.0, There we can.
108.0,110.0, You can't say Ubisoft.
111.0,114.0, The protesters were the one to agree with that.
114.0,115.0, Yeah.
115.0,116.0, Yeah.
116.0,118.0, They all gathered together to protest America's Army.
118.0,123.24," And at first, the message was that America's Army is, you know, is developed by the United"
123.24,128.0," States military, industrial, military, industrial complex."
128.0,134.0, And it's actually used to start recruiting people under 17 against a certain UN protocol and
134.0,136.0, and other things.
136.0,138.0, And then it kind of became.
139.0,142.0," Like, this game is just bad in general."
142.0,144.0," The fact that like, we've got some sponsoring a game."
144.0,146.0," I mean, well, there's like mixed messages right at any protest."
146.0,148.0, There's multiple voices and there's organizers.
148.0,152.0," And then the guy organizing it was like, you know, he was really level-headed and"
152.0,155.0," articulate, but then some of the other people that came up, it's kind of like,"
155.0,157.0, just looking for a cause.
157.0,159.0," You know, they weren't saying the game was bad."
159.0,160.0, Like the game mechanics are bad.
160.0,161.0, It's a bad to say.
161.0,162.0," Well, that would have been a customer."
162.0,164.0," Well, that was a horrible shit."
164.0,167.0, This was the joke because it's like the whole time we still have that.
167.0,172.0," They're like, chance in our head and some of more like, you will be soft, shame, shame."
172.0,174.0, War is not a game.
174.0,175.0, Good go.
175.0,176.0, War is not a game.
176.0,177.0, Good go.
177.0,178.0, Everybody in their mouths.
178.0,179.0, They're a funky protest.
179.0,183.0," Well, during the good-good part actually, it was like a little cowbell thing."
183.0,185.0," They really go, because they had, they had drums."
185.0,188.0," No, it wasn't good God, but you know, it's like this little cowbell."
188.0,189.0, It's good.
189.0,191.0, Did they bring like Frankie Ghost to Hollywood that a return?
191.0,192.0, No.
192.0,196.0, But they did all kinds of songs like it started out with like a senior songwriter guy and
196.0,201.0, this and another guy with an acoustic guitar like singing songs about the closing down
201.0,205.0," the junior rotsie, you know, because there's a big thing to say,"
205.0,209.0, if it's a skill against recruiting kids.
209.0,210.0, My question.
210.0,213.0," I mean, they're just protesting this game now."
213.0,215.0, He's been around for a long time.
215.0,218.0, Why did they just pick now to start?
218.0,219.0, I don't know.
219.0,221.0, I'm just going to say is they're like a new release out.
221.0,222.0, They released a new map pack.
223.0,228.0, And the funny thing was they sent their like representatives like storming into Ubisoft.
228.0,234.0, And the whole thing was like while we were watching all the music and people talk was waiting for them to come back from
234.0,240.0," Ubisoft and tell us, you know, what they found out on their mission to like deliver to Ubisoft their message."
240.0,244.0," And they came back and they're like, well, they basically agreed to stop making the game,"
244.0,247.0, because I guess they're not going to make the game anymore anyway.
247.0,249.0," I mean, that sort of is a mess."
249.0,250.0, Most of the like of protest.
250.0,253.0," Yeah, everything to the part of when it's follow up on the music thing."
253.0,258.0," Yeah, it was like then then they had like the open mic chant and then that one this one guy gets on it."
258.0,261.0, And you go from these like really open mic chant.
261.0,265.0," Yeah, like someone just basically like leads, you know, don't like you."
265.0,267.0, And one guy got it.
267.0,270.0," His like maneuver was no justice, no peace."
270.0,273.0, We can't be someone games that promote war in the Middle East.
273.0,274.0, Like it.
274.0,277.0," Yeah, you can't be introduced like, you know, 15 more syllables."
277.0,282.0," But I was saying it was like an after thought like we went there not knowing how we're going to cover it,"
282.0,287.0," whether or not it was going to be like daily show type coverage of code king and Berkeley, you know,"
287.0,292.0, protesting the recruiting station there or if we're going to go and get a serious look at it and like we ended up just.
292.0,296.0, We ended up really like having a determined for us because for the most part it was like highly scheduled.
296.0,299.0," There's very little opportunity to talk to people, but if it was a comedy thing,"
299.0,303.0, what I would have liked to have done is grab the mic and like start a channel about how the game's graphics are like.
303.0,311.0, Last day and a lot like the court game plays like we could have taken a few more dicks into Assassin's Creed while we were at it too.
311.0,321.0, The ther up it in the strange part about it was one of the things that there are sort of protests thing was that the game isn't realistic enough.
321.0,325.0," So it's almost as if they're you know, for it's low."
325.0,330.0," The whole thing was like, well, you know, this is a game about war, but you're not like killing civilians."
330.0,334.0," They had and families, which is kind of weird because it's like, well, it's a training game."
334.0,338.0, I don't think the army really wants to train you to kill civilians.
338.0,342.0, Like you should have introduced the GTA 4 if they really wanted to write.
342.0,346.0," They had a pair of former servicemen who are dishonorably discharged for like,"
346.0,352.0," coming to, you know, pro basically protesting against the war petition against it while being enlisted."
352.0,359.0," Yeah, they were, you know, listing, they're like, you know, the game will actually have a mission that's based on like nuclear art art."
359.0,367.0," They're like nuclear artillery training and he's like, you know, like, you know, like, you guys like, well, it shows you the fun part about this, but it doesn't, you know, it doesn't take into account that, you know,"
367.0,374.0," There's a quill and of a canary in the coal mine where someone has to pull their mat, you get like the least, the most expendable guy in the unit to take his mask off first."
374.0,379.0," And all these other things, and it just course the atrocities we've talked about them for two and the way that war games are really,"
379.0,387.0," you point stuff and shoot it and until now, I think David Jeff, he's been talking about wanting to make a war game that includes some of those elements where like their civilians."
387.0,393.0," And you have to decide, there are there are people who want to surrender themselves and do you fire on them or do you take them?"
393.0,402.0," So just acknowledging all that, yeah, and saying that it's a bloodless game that, um, that just, I mean, they were to the point where they were, they were upset that the game,"
402.0,408.0, Basically talks up like the quality of like px is and just like how nice it is.
408.0,416.0," Yeah, but one of the guys, one of the, one of the guys who had been a conscientious objecter, that was his big thing like he got up and, you know, everyone is like really happy."
416.0,423.0," To see someone in the military come up and speak and he was not exactly so in, in through the Aztec as the rest of the crowd."
423.0,434.0," He's like, yeah, you know, I guess this game kind of, this game pisses me off because you know, I played it and, and you go into the hospital and the nurses are all just talking about the quality of the px and all the facilities and stuff."
434.0,437.0," And I was like, that's bullshit. I couldn't even get playboy in there."
437.0,440.0, I just don't know if I could.
441.0,447.0," Did you get the sense that any of these people had really played the game where did they like, they're let it fired up and then complain."
447.0,460.0," One, one clearly hadn't a noblady, we interviewed, it's just like, it's one of those first games by which you met first first, and she was like, it's one of those first games and what I think that means is it puts you right in it and you go crazy like Rambo."
460.0,469.0," That was, but then the guy, the main guy, the spokes, the guy who organized the event is very knowledgeable, the game was clearly the de-applated and knew, you know, all about what was, you know,"
469.0,479.0," Yeah, I mean, you could tell, there were definitely like layers of people there. I mean, there were some people there who really organized an on topic and like not politically insane."
479.0,485.0, And then they're all these sort of hangers on and weird folks that come out because of San Francisco anti-weters.
485.0,488.0," So it's like, try going to be tribal drumming and yeah, yeah."
488.0,489.0," Yeah, yeah."
489.0,491.0, There was Johnny Chicken strips just for the hell of it.
491.0,493.0, All the burritos.
493.0,510.0," The most interesting and sort of out of control part of the whole thing was when we were still in the park before they marched to Ubisoft, like this kind of drunk in the middle of the day, that veteran shows up in the park and starts screaming at everyone."
510.0,513.0," It was, it was a really, at them."
513.0,519.0," Yeah, like he basically interrupted, but what we were talking about themselves, the women, they were called the raging granny."
519.0,521.0," The raging granny, that's they were singing."
521.0,523.0," That would be a great band, man."
523.0,525.0, It's not all that's cracked up to the right.
525.0,530.0," They were singing this like, they were singing this like nursery rhyme about, you know, keeping kids away from war."
530.0,535.0," Meanwhile, this drunk guy is like screaming at the audience. He's like, but what about me?"
535.0,539.0," You guys say no war, but I come home and nobody gives a shit about me."
539.0,550.0," And he's like going off and everyone, everyone, you can tell is really uncomfortable because that's the sort of the week spot for every war protestor is the veteran who comes out and says, yeah, these people don't really give a shit about me, you know."
550.0,551.0, Right.
551.0,556.0," But he was pretty insane and the funny part was he just sort of kept on talking until he started like,"
556.0,561.0," digressing and talking about how he wanted to kill George W. Bush and he's like, you can quote me on that."
561.0,564.0, I'll shoot him and like all this insane stuff.
564.0,565.0, Call the secrets there.
565.0,566.0, Oh man.
566.0,575.0," The one like it sucked it. He was so we're going to go here and he's the one, you know, valid point that he's buttered in between all the other insanity was that I had no choice."
575.0,583.0," When he and let's say he didn't elist because he played some hot game, but because he wasn't in a shitty position in life and that was one of the few viable options that he thought he had."
583.0,584.0, Yeah.
584.0,585.0, And that's like something that they're not addressing.
585.0,593.0," What it was like, put them immediately, it turned into him screaming about Jews and about killing George Bush and it was really, everyone gathered around immediately."
593.0,596.0, The all the press that was there just like flocked on that guy.
596.0,597.0," Oh, because shit."
597.0,598.0, It was funny.
598.0,599.0, It was funny.
599.0,606.0, It was funny to see how many people were there from game sites and stuff.
606.0,609.0, Everyone was tuned into it.
609.0,610.0, It's a blog orgy.
610.0,611.0, Yeah.
611.0,616.0," And you can tell the people, the anti-war people were sort of like surprised by how many people showed up with cameras and stuff."
616.0,617.0, Yeah.
617.0,618.0," Like, wow."
618.0,621.0," We really, you know, found the pulse with this one."
621.0,626.0, It's all a bunch of like video game nerds hanging out with cameras like smirking.
626.0,634.0," The thing, the other thing I was awkward about, it was like when they came when the couple reported back from having, you know, talk with a U.V. sauce."
634.0,641.0," They were, you know, they're like, you guys, they handed out all these stickers that they're basically like surgeon generals morning for playing this game."
641.0,647.0," And they were like, they, first they're encouraging you to go through all the stores that sell the game and the area and sticker the games, you know."
647.0,650.0," But then they're like, I'm not saying this week, they treated us nicely."
650.0,653.0, So you can put the stickers on the street post and stuff in the area.
653.0,658.0," And it was all like very like wink, wink, and I, you know, put that motherfucker all over the front door."
658.0,660.0," And of course, they marched down the street."
660.0,664.0," The first thing you see, the Ubisoft front doors are just covered in these stickers now."
664.0,667.0," And there, the guy was bragging about how hard the stickers were to remove too."
667.0,672.0," Or you know, he's just like, these are industrial strength."
672.0,678.0," And the stickers were like warning this game, because death and guilt or something."
678.0,681.0," It was like, this is long."
681.0,682.0, Is it?
682.0,686.0," We're to see their perspective too, because they, when they describe even walking into the Ubisoft lobby,"
686.0,690.0," I mean, we all hear know that they have like a Sam Fisher statue in the lobby."
690.0,695.0," And they described it like, it was like a fucking Gestapo statue or something."
695.0,701.0," You know, we walk in this door and there's just this really creepy, really scary kind of like the statue,"
701.0,704.0," just like, you know, over military man's statue."
704.0,708.0, And the people in there have got these buttons on and they're just really creepy.
708.0,711.0," That was like, that was like, I described everything."
711.0,714.0," Yeah, I understood again that like what they were referring to."
714.0,720.0," In this case, Ubisoft got a logo for Ghost Reconents, like a silhouette of a guy with gas mask holding an MP5 or something."
720.0,723.0," And like, you know, to them that this was more like, this was like SS button."
723.0,728.0," It's just funny that like, knowing that the lobby, it would be soft."
728.0,732.0," It's designed to make any like 18 year old man who walks to the door go,"
732.0,734.0," Oh, awesome."
734.0,738.0," And meanwhile, like any war protester goes in there and goes, oh my god."
738.0,740.0, And I always this had it.
740.0,745.0, And all the guys that get all the people who do be soft wearing those buttons are all probably like SF liberals.
745.0,751.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah, they were peeking out the window and it was just all like just in the San Francisco type scenario."
751.0,757.0, You get the feeling that's a slow day in the SF protest scene if this was what they chose to do.
757.0,761.0," You know, like when they were covering their bases, they were like,"
761.0,769.0," they had someone there, they were commemorating the 60 with third anniversary of bombing of like Hiroshima."
769.0,776.0," And then they were talking about the ROTC, like, you know, the same capacity that it's recruiting minors."
776.0,783.0, And they had all bases cover people were handing out some pliers about voting for them and for like protesting like Muni.
783.0,786.0," This is like, you know, municipal transportation in San Francisco."
786.0,788.0, It's just a fantastic year.
788.0,790.0, It's like a protest scene.
790.0,797.0," And they had like two or three elected officials there, which I was really surprised by and like a couple of people from the school board."
797.0,803.0, There was somebody there running for like city supervisor of the district that Ubisoft is in.
803.0,807.0," And I was really surprised by his balls. He's like, we love video games."
807.0,810.0, We love the high tech industry.
810.0,814.0, And how did you please make games about peace?
814.0,816.0, My pretty pony.
816.0,820.0," Yeah, you can tell you, it's taking a big risk there."
820.0,822.0," I think he was speaking to the wrong crowd, maybe."
822.0,823.0, Right.
823.0,826.0, I have a story I've been wanting to tell you guys ever since the moment it happened.
826.0,828.0, And I had no appreciative audience.
828.0,832.0, That's when I was flying to Dallas Fort Worth for Quake on last week.
832.0,837.0," And on the way there, a guy in the middle seat, this is a 74 year old guy in."
837.0,842.0," He's like, taking up my arm rest and at first I was like, this is going to be a fairly horrible thing."
842.0,844.0," God, it's not that long."
844.0,845.0, And we start talking.
845.0,847.0," And he says, you know what?"
847.0,851.0, You basically portrayed himself as like you're sitting next to like a pillar of wisdom.
851.0,854.0, And it's going to be idiotic if you just sit here and not like learn for me.
854.0,856.0," So I was like, fuck it then."
856.0,858.0, I'm going to learn.
858.0,860.0, So I start talking to him.
860.0,864.0, And but then I started to regret that because he was spitting on me the whole thing.
864.0,868.0, So I took my I took my blanket put that over my arms.
868.0,869.0, Yeah.
869.0,872.0, So the important thing here is I want to say he was a 74 year old black man.
872.0,879.0, And the only reason that the detail of their matters is because you have certain assumptions about the kind of conversations you're going to have with people.
879.0,880.0, Very natural when you stand with someone.
880.0,882.0, It's going to be the range of you've been in our discussion.
882.0,888.0," And in his case, I was just thinking like he's going to be thinking that the world has gotten to hell and I had to ask very much like my dad, you know."
888.0,890.0, Like I mean he's and he did.
891.0,898.0," But in between all of them, sandity, in between him telling me that I would be stupid to marry woman who's not nine years my younger."
898.0,902.0, Because I'm going to continue to get hard on someone sex.
902.0,906.0," You know, and she's going to dry up and hit and all this."
906.0,907.0, And all this.
907.0,913.0, And it turns out he's like he starts talking about playing Pogo playing chess online.
913.0,916.0," And so I was like, okay, listening to him and he's weighing the chest."
916.0,919.0," And the next thing he says, you know, he's like, I go on there."
919.0,921.0, He's a lot of really good people.
921.0,923.0," He's like, and they they talk a lot of trash sometimes."
923.0,930.0," And he's like, so what I do to those buckers is like, I turn on that Pogo and I turn on this other computer I have and it's got chess master."
930.0,932.0, He's got cheat on it.
932.0,933.0, Oh my god.
933.0,936.0, These these guys then I start talking shit on them.
936.0,937.0, They put it on me.
937.0,940.0," He's like, I put the moving the chest master."
940.0,943.0, Chess master puts out the move I put it back in on them.
943.0,946.0," He's like, he starts screaming and he's yelling."
946.0,948.0," He's like, he's a 74 year old."
948.0,949.0, You chess troll.
949.0,950.0," Yeah, do it."
950.0,951.0, And that was like that.
951.0,955.0," I was cracking up and like, I was like, that's totally amazing."
955.0,960.0," But I couldn't tell him like, I couldn't say, you know what, I pretty much like, I totally like condone this because I do."
960.0,967.0," I just went like, I can tell I mentioned I was like, well, that's funny because you know, I work in games stuff and I can tell like right away."
967.0,969.0, Like it just wouldn't register.
969.0,971.0," So I was like, that's a, that's a great story, man."
971.0,974.0, But so that was pretty cool to find like a 74 year old grief.
975.0,976.0, That's a great idea.
976.0,982.0," And he tells me, he plays so much and he tries, it's just like, it shows you how universal this thing is right."
982.0,985.0," You know, in our T.S. is we always talk about Smurf accounts."
985.0,992.0," You go in and you don't want to have a stats say you played 10,000 games because no one's going to join you unless they played 20,000 and they'll kick your ass."
992.0,997.0," So he has these really high stats, but he doesn't know how to make a new account or whatever the way it works."
997.0,1003.0, So what he does is he goes in and he tells people that he's playing in prison and that everyone in prison shares the same.
1003.0,1004.0, And shares the same account.
1004.0,1008.0, She shares the same fucking way to elaborate the story.
1008.0,1009.0, That's a lot of people.
1009.0,1012.0, He's a determined 70 year old.
1012.0,1015.0," Yeah, he was, yeah, I was like, I'm like, I think that's wonderful."
1015.0,1020.0," You're using your brain like that and it's your own, you know, you're not deterred from playing online games."
1020.0,1022.0, But that kind of crap is rampant.
1022.0,1025.0," I mean, poker and online poker, it's like a serious problem."
1025.0,1027.0, You get four people who are colluding and instant messengers.
1027.0,1029.0," Yeah, happens all right."
1029.0,1030.0, I'm not surprised.
1031.0,1034.0," I mean, even in the most casual shit, I've played like Yahoo,"
1034.0,1037.0, Cribbage and ticket to ride is another one.
1037.0,1040.0, Back when that was just an online free online game.
1040.0,1046.0, There was as much like griefing and people yelling and arguing in chat as in counter strike.
1046.0,1048.0," Yeah, it was like amazing to me."
1048.0,1052.0," Yeah, like I remember like being ganged up on by two dudes in ticket to ride."
1052.0,1055.0," No, and this is like the most casual fucking game."
1055.0,1059.0," You know, I just was on it just a waste time and I realized after a while that these two guys were totally teaming."
1059.0,1062.0, We're totally teaming up against me behind my back.
1062.0,1063.0, But it's a game about about.
1063.0,1065.0," About railroad tycoons, right?"
1065.0,1067.0," But it's your, it's every man from top."
1067.0,1069.0, It's not a team thing.
1069.0,1072.0," But even if it's even, but the same same thing with the real tycoons."
1072.0,1075.0," I mean, on the face, they just follow."
1075.0,1078.0, They were following the seared up the nightly century railroad.
1078.0,1079.0, Parents.
1079.0,1082.0," So you just saying, so therefore it's not griefing."
1082.0,1085.0," Wow, you just said he was a bit of a show."
1085.0,1092.0," Yeah, but yeah, I mean, that it's crazy how that behaviors not limited to like hardcore gamers."
1092.0,1093.0, It's like every.
1093.0,1094.0, Everybody wants to cheat.
1094.0,1098.0," I mean, everybody from the day that they learn how to play monopoly in their nine years old."
1098.0,1101.0," You start figuring out that if I play banker, I can just pull those 500."
1101.0,1102.0, That's what I thought.
1102.0,1105.0, I just watched a sign fault last night where do you guys remember this one?
1105.0,1108.0, We're a creamer and newmaner in the middle of a risk game.
1108.0,1112.0, And they have to put the board in Jerry's apartment because they're worried that one of the others
1113.0,1115.0, is going to cheat all up a foot.
1115.0,1118.0, So I'm trying to break in to move the risk pieces.
1118.0,1121.0," Yeah, that's the ultimate fist fight game though risk golf scores."
1121.0,1124.0," I'm sure the same way, you know, like I said, we're calling."
1124.0,1128.0," We're right about, you know, surveys of people like getting to admit that they like that they"
1128.0,1130.0, fudge their their scores at the.
1130.0,1131.0," Oh, sure."
1131.0,1133.0, It's not rampant like golf cheating.
1133.0,1134.0," Yeah, it's like kicking the ball."
1134.0,1136.0, But then you're like cheating against yourself.
1136.0,1137.0, That's what I don't get.
1137.0,1139.0," I mean, not if there's money on the body."
1139.0,1140.0," Yeah, there's money on the body."
1140.0,1141.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1141.0,1143.0, But that guy was cheating against himself too.
1143.0,1144.0, He's like not learning from Chinese.
1144.0,1146.0," Yeah, I just loved the dude."
1146.0,1149.0, So could you think he could beat them without?
1149.0,1151.0," I mean, did he make it seem like he was really good?"
1151.0,1155.0," It's pretty good, but he acknowledged that there's like just an enormous range of skill levels."
1155.0,1158.0, And that there are people on there that would whip them up and like so that's why he would come back.
1158.0,1163.0," He challenged him to a rematch, you know, and said like, you know, I wasn't thinking straight or like he would do the thing."
1163.0,1165.0, That was my that was the other guy in this this other cell.
1165.0,1166.0, Like now it's my turn.
1166.0,1167.0," Yeah, like."
1167.0,1168.0," No, no."
1169.0,1178.0, What was the deal with the new have you guys heard about the this new like hip hop theme like chess community side started by the good things.
1178.0,1180.0," Yeah, yeah, I've heard about it, but I haven't like that."
1180.0,1184.0," I heard I heard some like on the media story about about it where it's like, you know,"
1184.0,1189.0," supposed to be social networking and playing chess with people, but it's hip hop thing."
1189.0,1191.0," I was working with a scrabble, right?"
1191.0,1195.0," Yeah, I thought it was a weird project, but I ought to check that out."
1195.0,1196.0, I'm selling this.
1196.0,1198.0," Yes, it's kind of like a audio player."
1198.0,1200.0," Jillian, were you a yes, scrabble, it was player?"
1200.0,1201.0," I was not a big scrabble, it was player."
1201.0,1208.0," I'm a big online test player, but I wasn't a big scrabble, it was player, but I played scrabble online like actual like official"
1208.0,1212.0," The whole has broke, but it crucifix over it said it was okay."
1212.0,1213.0, Right.
1213.0,1216.0, But the new version seems like it might actually be a better game.
1216.0,1217.0," Like, all right."
1217.0,1221.0," It seems like they've twisted it a couple of ways, which make it more interesting because scrabbles pretty"
1221.0,1222.0, freaking boring.
1222.0,1223.0, What is it called now?
1223.0,1224.0, It's a weird deal.
1224.0,1227.0, You guys know about this kind of unboxing?
1227.0,1228.0, You think you thought of this?
1228.0,1232.0," Yeah, were they took it down and then a couple of days later, they showed up with some slightly"
1232.0,1233.0, modified writers.
1233.0,1236.0," Yeah, they saw some of the rules and they changed the name of word scrabble or word."
1236.0,1241.0," Yeah, and then the date that scrabble went online officially in scrabbiosis play."
1241.0,1243.0, So that got hacked and shut down.
1243.0,1248.0, So my angry scrabbulous players are sometimes.
1248.0,1250.0, Everything online is common.
1250.0,1252.0, People get fucking worked up about scrabble.
1252.0,1253.0, That's ridiculous.
1253.0,1254.0, What's the more ridiculous?
1254.0,1256.0, It's a game you worked up about.
1256.0,1257.0, Wow.
1257.0,1260.0," I mean, if it's what you're killing your time with, I guess."
1260.0,1261.0, Right.
1261.0,1263.0, I've seen crazy crap all week.
1263.0,1265.0," Like another thing, quite common."
1265.0,1268.0, We didn't have a camera and it sucked because I totally wanted to capture.
1268.0,1270.0, It's like way late at night.
1270.0,1273.0, It's like a hundred degrees in insanely human and doubts.
1273.0,1276.0, All the people from the convention go out to this grass like bowling green.
1276.0,1283.0, And they all throw their shoes into this big enormous pile and then they all start spinning around.
1283.0,1285.0," And the idea is, they're still making this."
1285.0,1290.0," So we walked up and half of where we're in the shamed tub, which was even better because I was like,"
1290.0,1291.0, we could have shot a scene.
1291.0,1296.0," It was like, who the fuck throws their shoes in the heap and then like charges it after making themselves dizzy."
1296.0,1299.0," It's like, oh, like you just all you have to do is just pan the back."
1299.0,1301.0," And you'd be like, shame, shame, shame."
1301.0,1302.0, But so they did this.
1302.0,1304.0, Explain the shame type for people.
1304.0,1308.0," Yeah, this is the, so it's time to pimpe it like I recommend you check a couple videos."
1308.0,1311.0, We put their like video walkin tours of QuakeCon.
1311.0,1317.0, And the shamed type is just this like a very large shirt and then it has like a picture of like a gamer.
1317.0,1319.0, I don't know. You guys have seen that you can describe it.
1319.0,1322.0, It's like a wanted picture sort of where lineup picture.
1322.0,1324.0, It's like a little brother or something.
1324.0,1325.0," Like a wife, theater."
1325.0,1330.0, He looks like an extra from the fast and the furious with some like driving gloves on trying to look tough.
1330.0,1331.0, Yeah.
1331.0,1335.0," And then what's the slogan on it like, you know, gamer for life, gamer for life."
1335.0,1339.0, So so then they threw this their shoes in this pile.
1339.0,1343.0," And then of course, then they all ran in there and like it was just this stupidest thing."
1343.0,1346.0," Did they like, did they actually like start beating the crap out of each other?"
1346.0,1347.0, Because that I could understand.
1347.0,1348.0, I actually got in there.
1348.0,1350.0, There's such a massive body that I couldn't tell.
1350.0,1355.0, I know whoever was in middle was probably getting like wrecked and then some of them were really drunk.
1355.0,1357.0, And they were kind of hanging around the perimeter.
1357.0,1361.0, And then they would take shoes. They'd sneak them real quick and then grab them and curl them like far away.
1361.0,1365.0," Like out, you know, out into the bushes and trees and stuff."
1365.0,1368.0, And then they started throwing more shoes onto the mob of people.
1368.0,1370.0, So people were getting hit in the head with shoes.
1370.0,1371.0, Totally.
1371.0,1373.0, I missed it detail here.
1373.0,1377.0, What exactly were the people in the mob doing trying to get their shoes?
1377.0,1382.0, Because they had all thrown them into this big center of this ring of the circle they formed.
1382.0,1386.0, And then so and like rake them all together with this like an opportunity to get exercise.
1386.0,1388.0, What was otherwise a sad tear.
1388.0,1389.0, Pretty much.
1389.0,1391.0, I'm not following this at all.
1391.0,1394.0, They get their shoes and throw them into a circle so they could go get them.
1394.0,1396.0," Okay, imagine a hundred of the sick ones here."
1396.0,1398.0, They'd be like fight over them.
1398.0,1399.0, I don't get it.
1399.0,1400.0, A hundred people stand in a circle.
1400.0,1401.0, They take after shoes.
1401.0,1403.0, They throw their shoes into a big pile.
1403.0,1405.0, Someone rakes the pile up.
1405.0,1408.0, So you have to imagine that this is now 200 individual shoes.
1408.0,1410.0, Then they're all mixed up.
1410.0,1411.0, It's dark outside.
1411.0,1413.0, Everyone in the circle spins around until they're dizzy.
1413.0,1414.0, Someone blows a whistle.
1414.0,1416.0, And then you run in to try to find the shoes.
1416.0,1418.0, You have to do Japanese game show?
1418.0,1420.0," Yeah, it's a bad real bad one."
1420.0,1424.0, It's going to be the motivation for some months of once.
1424.0,1427.0, It's a participant because I just don't see how it's supposed to be.
1427.0,1428.0, I just don't see how it's supposed to be here.
1428.0,1430.0," The rules are just go, you know, fuck."
1430.0,1431.0, I'm not gonna go do something.
1431.0,1433.0, A lot of people are walking outside.
1433.0,1434.0, I'm like looking at it and thinking that.
1434.0,1437.0, But I guess like if you just drink balls all day in.
1437.0,1439.0, This is the same.
1439.0,1442.0, These are the same guys that made the PC that was inside the.
1442.0,1443.0, Like a barbecue.
1443.0,1444.0, Like a barbecue.
1444.0,1445.0, That was good.
1445.0,1446.0," Oh, that was good."
1446.0,1447.0, So if you just.
1447.0,1448.0, That's pretty much what happens.
1448.0,1450.0, But like it's wrapped the show up like where I was surprised.
1450.0,1452.0, They had a lot of people come up and say hi.
1452.0,1454.0, I like listen to the podcast and stuff.
1454.0,1455.0, No school meeting everyone.
1455.0,1457.0, So to get a good time overall.
1457.0,1458.0, I quite come.
1458.0,1459.0," Yeah, it was totally fun."
1459.0,1460.0, I think we made it.
1460.0,1461.0, We tried to make it funny.
1461.0,1462.0," I mean, if you videos were great."
1462.0,1464.0, If you go just normally for press.
1464.0,1469.0, I could see how it would be pretty boring because all there is is the keynote on one of the evenings.
1469.0,1471.0, And then there are.
1471.0,1473.0, What's the keynote really two and a half hours?
1473.0,1474.0, A couple interviews.
1474.0,1478.0," It was three hours for the entire thing, which was insane for one because I was."
1478.0,1482.0, It out lasted my laptops freshly charged battery.
1482.0,1484.0, And also like.
1484.0,1489.0," I mean, no, I don't think anyone in the right mind ever has a convention without an intermission for three hours."
1489.0,1492.0," It's just normal, you know, people are going to want something to drink."
1492.0,1494.0, They're going to want to use the restroom or something.
1494.0,1495.0, And on and on it goes.
1495.0,1496.0, But to John.
1496.0,1498.0, John Carmichs the reason that it went on so long.
1498.0,1501.0," And to his credit, what happens is that everything moves along fairly quickly."
1501.0,1504.0, But then they open the floor and he does a question on answer.
1504.0,1510.0," And he just and he just he has so much to say, but also, I mean, really admirable trade is like he."
1510.0,1514.0," There's all these people in that crowd and instead of just saying, like,"
1514.0,1516.0," Hey, you guys have to understand."
1516.0,1517.0, I can't be up here all night.
1517.0,1518.0, I can do 10 questions.
1518.0,1520.0, He will not stop until he's answered every question.
1520.0,1522.0," Well, he waits until the audience is exhausted."
1522.0,1526.0," And then when it gets to the point where it's clear that everyone's asked all their questions,"
1526.0,1529.0," then they, you're getting this weird like feedback loop,"
1529.0,1530.0, where then they feel awkward.
1530.0,1532.0," So they're like, shit, we better ask questions."
1532.0,1534.0, I'm not going to get nothing.
1534.0,1535.0, I think he's asking questions.
1535.0,1536.0, And he gets answered.
1536.0,1538.0," And then that's when some of us are like,"
1538.0,1540.0," fuck, come on."
1540.0,1543.0, He's also so forthright.
1543.0,1546.0," I mean, he's one of those people that when you ask him, you know,"
1546.0,1547.0, what do you hate?
1547.0,1550.0, He's going to give you every single line of it.
1550.0,1552.0, It's great too because there are so few people with that.
1552.0,1553.0," I mean, it's combination."
1553.0,1556.0, I think it's personality and also the position he's in.
1556.0,1560.0, There are relatively few people in the business that have that kind of freedom.
1560.0,1563.0, And so it's fantastic when you do speak to someone that has it.
1563.0,1564.0, Gabe Nules and other person.
1564.0,1567.0," Yeah, I say it's the only other person I can think of because they've worked for themselves."
1567.0,1568.0," Yeah, right."
1568.0,1571.0, And it's nice to just not have to like listen to any.
1571.0,1575.0," I mean, I'm not saying that I mean, everything's bullshit that we get from other sources."
1575.0,1577.0, But it's like it's just so clear.
1577.0,1582.0," They're never pausing and thinking about how they want to phrase something that's going to,"
1582.0,1584.0," like, you know, play Kate the people standing behind them."
1584.0,1587.0, It's just like coming right off of the top of the head.
1587.0,1590.0," And I mean, so that's cool to talk to when that respect."
1590.0,1595.0," Yeah, I kind of made fun of Gabe on the on my live blog, the E live blog about,"
1595.0,1597.0," you know, the way how slumpy he went to."
1597.0,1600.0," And I guess some people got mad that I'm at that and, you know,"
1600.0,1602.0," some, you know, people who work with him were like,"
1602.0,1603.0, I think you have to do that.
1603.0,1607.0," But the truth is though that there was, I actually sort of admired it too."
1607.0,1611.0," That he just walks on there like, yeah, I'm Gabe Nule and fuck you."
1611.0,1616.0," You know, I mean, not like that, but just sort of like that he knows he can just do whatever the hell he wants."
1616.0,1617.0, And he does.
1617.0,1619.0," Well, right. And then he's cool when he talks."
1619.0,1621.0, He's cool. Right. And he's totally a genius.
1621.0,1622.0," Well, right. It's kind of the same way."
1622.0,1623.0, Yeah.
1623.0,1624.0, Yeah.
1624.0,1625.0, Yeah.
1625.0,1628.0," Like his TED thing or, you know, any time he stands up at a microphone, he kind of just tells you whatever the hell he wants to tell you."
1628.0,1629.0, Yeah.
1629.0,1630.0, Yeah.
1630.0,1631.0, Yeah.
1631.0,1635.0," Although, the carmack doesn't come off with quite the same marketing polish that it will right does because he'll,"
1635.0,1640.0, you always get the sense when carmack speaks that whatever the last thing he was doing that was really cool is what he's going to talk about.
1640.0,1644.0," Whether it's the right thing or not. I mean, all the stuff he was talking about iPhone gaming."
1644.0,1648.0," It's like he's only had the thing for a couple weeks, but he's just like, this is it. This is what I'm doing next."
1648.0,1649.0, It's going to be great.
1649.0,1652.0," You know, probably reverse engineered the whole device."
1652.0,1655.0, We programmed it like a rocket ship or something.
1655.0,1657.0, So a lot of the questions were about that.
1657.0,1660.0," We're about his, you know, his various stuff in rocket science."
1660.0,1661.0," So I mean, it was interesting."
1661.0,1667.0," There were people talking about space diving, which is essentially now people want to take the rockets that, you know,"
1667.0,1676.0, the carmack and some of the others that have been working on these various programs have developed and basically create a suit that allows you to ride the thing up and then basically come back down.
1676.0,1681.0," From, you know, the highest possible before you leave the atmosphere."
1681.0,1684.0, Or you can just strap the rocket to your chest and let it explode.
1684.0,1685.0, Yeah.
1685.0,1686.0, It really feels better the same.
1686.0,1691.0," And the crazy, the funny thing too is he's like, you know, who would want to do this? He's like, there's a line."
1691.0,1695.0," You know, I mean, there's actually a line of people waiting to pay to do it."
1696.0,1707.0," Mark Reigns and other guy. I think he fits in that camp of having the freedom and then I was thinking as we were talking, it was like lately more and more, you know, Dennis Dyax, but it's like I think for some people he epitomizes where it can"
1707.0,1709.0, Backfire to some extent on someone.
1709.0,1718.0," Well, kids and I have nothing against, but I mean, just talking strictly outside of my own perspective, you know, public response to some of his recent commentary, you know."
1718.0,1721.0," Yeah, I mean, I think he wades in a little too deep."
1721.0,1722.0, Right.
1722.0,1723.0, Yeah.
1723.0,1732.0," Big difference between sitting here and saying, you know, I'm developing here's why the 360 is really a better platform than the PS3, which is one of your interviews with Carmac, you know, he was going off on."
1732.0,1738.0," And the stuff that Dyax been talking about, which is really just as much sort of waiting in hip deep and stirring up shit."
1738.0,1741.0, And it's also kind of more self-serving and defensive.
1741.0,1742.0, Yeah.
1742.0,1745.0, The bad is on stuff as opposed to sort of talking about the industry.
1745.0,1754.0, That's like nobody wants to see someone have to like get down to the level of defending themselves to like any random person on a message board.
1754.0,1755.0, You're right.
1755.0,1756.0," It's like, oh, don't do that."
1756.0,1760.0," You're going to have to steep down like, just you know, you made this thing."
1760.0,1761.0, Let us speak for itself.
1761.0,1764.0," You don't, you shouldn't have to like write message board posts to defend your game."
1764.0,1767.0," Your game should, should speak for itself."
1767.0,1768.0," Ta-da, but Kathy is."
1768.0,1769.0, Yeah.
1769.0,1772.0, He's a little bit less wacky about it.
1772.0,1774.0," But yeah, I would say so."
1775.0,1776.0, He has a blog.
1776.0,1777.0, Does have a blog.
1777.0,1778.0, He does have a blog.
1778.0,1780.0, He does have a blog.
1780.0,1783.0, He and Ryan are having a moment right now.
1783.0,1785.0, Staying into his eyes.
1785.0,1787.0, You have the most beautiful slate.
1787.0,1789.0, Slaid blue eyes.
1789.0,1790.0, That's what people tell me.
1790.0,1791.0, I never noticed.
1791.0,1794.0," You'd be, you know, we talk about, we talk about games."
1794.0,1796.0, We get a protest.
1796.0,1800.0, We don't take the time to sit and just get to know each other.
1800.0,1801.0, Yeah.
1801.0,1803.0, Tell me about your childhood.
1803.0,1804.0, Wow.
1804.0,1807.0, Do we have anything now that you're on the spot?
1807.0,1811.0," We have any, any Ryan's got moments?"
1811.0,1813.0, We just had one from that.
1813.0,1815.0, It was electrifying.
1815.0,1818.0, I'm not cold sweat over here.
1818.0,1822.0, Now I'm on the spot now.
1822.0,1823.0, We've been doing.
1823.0,1825.0, You played so caliber online yet?
1825.0,1826.0, I did.
1826.0,1827.0, Yeah.
1827.0,1828.0, How'd that go?
1828.0,1829.0, It went well.
1829.0,1830.0, Out of about 40 matches.
1830.0,1832.0, We're only a couple of it.
1832.0,1833.0, Yeah.
1833.0,1835.0," Well, over the past few days."
1835.0,1836.0, Cool.
1836.0,1838.0, There were only a couple matches with an enosable lag.
1838.0,1842.0, So I'm kind of in your camp about how amazing it is.
1842.0,1843.0, Yeah.
1843.0,1847.0," I know there's some people complaining about how online's busted, but I don't know what"
1847.0,1848.0, they're talking about.
1848.0,1852.0," When the performance bars at five, and that's the max, and it's always that way."
1852.0,1855.0," I've been, you know, rowdy's based near zone, and it's always at five for him."
1855.0,1858.0," When I play a him and people in California, it's like perfect."
1858.0,1861.0," But we've been playing a lot of people in Albany, New York, and it's at four."
1861.0,1862.0," And it's totally fine, too."
1862.0,1867.0," Now, and then there could be a thing where you want to like debate the timing of a guard impact or something."
1867.0,1872.0," But for the most part, it's like, it's really like impressive to me how well it works."
1872.0,1875.0," You know, and so for that reason alone, I've been waiting for that for the longest time."
1875.0,1881.0," Why is it that forever, like fighting fighting game developers, like we can't do it?"
1881.0,1882.0, It's impossible.
1882.0,1883.0, Yeah.
1883.0,1884.0, You can't.
1884.0,1885.0, You can't.
1885.0,1886.0, You can't.
1886.0,1887.0, You can't.
1887.0,1888.0, You can't.
1888.0,1889.0, You can't.
1889.0,1893.0," You know, played decently online was just out of the realm of possibility."
1893.0,1895.0, And now it just seems like right.
1895.0,1899.0," I mean, well, every, I mean, because every frame counts, I mean, that's been the argument that I've heard."
1899.0,1906.0," You know, we understand why that would be the case, but it's like every frame counts and, you know, in counter strike as well."
1906.0,1909.0," I mean, if it's actually if you're playing seriously, it's not like you're going to be like,"
1909.0,1910.0," Yeah, that's fine."
1910.0,1911.0, I can't hit him because of lag.
1911.0,1912.0," I mean, it's."
1912.0,1913.0, That's can piss you off.
1913.0,1915.0," You're not going to play, you know."
1915.0,1916.0, Yeah.
1916.0,1918.0, How are the above physics in Soul God?
1919.0,1921.0, Next question.
1921.0,1925.0, I'm asking because I saw an article on games radar.
1925.0,1927.0, Why don't you go read that article?
1927.0,1928.0, Yeah.
1928.0,1929.0, Yeah.
1929.0,1931.0, I hear Yoda has killer boobs.
1931.0,1932.0, That's really.
1932.0,1933.0, Yeah.
1933.0,1934.0, Killer.
1934.0,1935.0, I think green.
1935.0,1937.0, I think those kids play to have to be.
1937.0,1939.0, The thing is they're also pretty hairy.
1939.0,1940.0, Yeah.
1940.0,1942.0, Green hairy boobs.
1942.0,1943.0, He's got three.
1943.0,1944.0, It's a thing that's.
1944.0,1945.0, It's a thing that's.
1945.0,1946.0, It's a thing that's.
1947.0,1951.0," The thing that people don't realize is that for Yoda between the ages of 200 and 800,"
1951.0,1954.0, he constantly lactates.
1954.0,1955.0," Oh, wow."
1955.0,1957.0, Is that kind of an iron on?
1957.0,1958.0, It is that a good thing.
1958.0,1959.0," No, that's what the hair is."
1959.0,1960.0, They call milk hair.
1960.0,1962.0, And it's really.
1962.0,1963.0," Yoda milk is really,"
1963.0,1964.0, Pneak.
1964.0,1966.0, And it's really.
1966.0,1969.0, Yoda milk is really futures smelling.
1969.0,1970.0, It turns immediately into this.
1970.0,1971.0, So.
1971.0,1972.0, So they actually animate that.
1972.0,1973.0, Could that be slow down.
1973.0,1975.0, They were in rate.
1975.0,1979.0, They went all out.
1979.0,1982.0, We already know every frame count.
1982.0,1985.0, You write a lot of Star Wars fan things.
1985.0,1990.0," Oh, I said the review."
1990.0,1991.0, I can't help it.
1991.0,1995.0, I'm just intrigued by the physical...
1995.0,1996.0, Is Yoda her man for night though?
1996.0,1997.0," No, I'm curious."
1997.0,1999.0, Because I know you do read all those novels.
1999.0,2002.0," He says, hey, I mean, they say he about him."
2002.0,2003.0," Yeah, he's a guy."
2003.0,2004.0, There was that girl.
2004.0,2005.0," No, but that was like..."
2005.0,2010.0," And Robert said, that was like 200 to 600 years ago, not now."
2010.0,2012.0," Yeah, it's like..."
2012.0,2017.0, At the S.A.D. that you is now a woman for all of us.
2017.0,2019.0, Maybe we're there female...
2019.0,2022.0, There was one on the Jedi Council in Episode 1.
2022.0,2023.0, There was her name.
2023.0,2024.0, Yes.
2024.0,2025.0, What?
2025.0,2026.0, Yaddle.
2026.0,2027.0, Yeah.
2027.0,2029.0, The good Lord was she smoking hot.
2029.0,2030.0," Oh, oh."
2030.0,2031.0, That's the female Yoda.
2031.0,2032.0, So she must be right now.
2032.0,2034.0," There were like 1,000 hot castlers in her Zalgoyne."
2034.0,2035.0, Yaddle.
2035.0,2036.0, Who's that?
2036.0,2038.0, Who's that surname?
2038.0,2039.0, Dumb shit.
2039.0,2040.0," Oh, no, my God."
2040.0,2041.0, That's why it's...
2041.0,2042.0, That's why it's like...
2042.0,2044.0, Star Wars is completely unbelievable.
2044.0,2048.0," Because if we ever in the course of humanity even like tens of thousands of years from now,"
2048.0,2051.0, came upon any race of being that looked like Yoda.
2051.0,2052.0, We would kill them all.
2052.0,2054.0, Or we would be killed by them.
2054.0,2057.0," There's no way we could have ever say like, hey, you want to come to dinner?"
2057.0,2058.0, Yaddle?
2058.0,2059.0, Yaddle appeared on the time.
2059.0,2063.0, I don't know what appeared on the tire bank show in Tyler Giver and I pot nano.
2063.0,2067.0, I'm gonna make over.
2067.0,2068.0, Yeah.
2068.0,2070.0," Oh, you look so fine."
2070.0,2072.0," Oh, Lord."
2072.0,2076.0," That's an intriguing thought, though, Robert."
2076.0,2077.0, You might be right.
2077.0,2082.0, What would happen if we ran into Yoda?
2082.0,2084.0," Well, kill on sight."
2084.0,2085.0, Kill on sight.
2085.0,2087.0, But they have the force and we know nothing.
2087.0,2088.0, They would kill us.
2088.0,2090.0, But we would not be co-existing.
2090.0,2091.0, That is a fact.
2091.0,2092.0, Yeah.
2092.0,2095.0," We need to find out how that happened, how the first meeting happened."
2095.0,2096.0, Or is there already been fiction?
2096.0,2097.0, I'm just gonna be...
2097.0,2098.0, There's...
2098.0,2099.0, Star Trek.
2099.0,2100.0, There's a story.
2100.0,2102.0, There's other guys yelling into the thing now.
2102.0,2103.0, It's in the book.
2103.0,2105.0, The 786 book.
2105.0,2109.0," I'm really hoping we'll be answered in the co-tor at MMO, right?"
2109.0,2111.0," Oh, I'm over this live."
2111.0,2112.0, That's right.
2112.0,2113.0, Right.
2113.0,2114.0, Right.
2114.0,2115.0, That'd be awesome.
2116.0,2118.0, There's a... there's a suggestion for a questline by where.
2118.0,2119.0, Yeah.
2119.0,2120.0," Yeah, it'll..."
2120.0,2121.0, Yeah.
2121.0,2122.0," And with the gable origin, right?"
2122.0,2123.0, Yeah.
2123.0,2124.0, Or a little bit of a strange thought.
2124.0,2126.0, Whether sexual orientation of the Yoda race?
2126.0,2127.0, Yeah.
2127.0,2128.0, All right.
2128.0,2129.0, I need to...
2129.0,2130.0, I slice that.
2130.0,2131.0, I slice that.
2131.0,2133.0, I'm interested in it.
2133.0,2134.0, Another questline.
2134.0,2135.0, Yeah.
2135.0,2137.0, Get 10 cups of...
2137.0,2138.0, Yeah.
2138.0,2139.0, Milk.
2139.0,2140.0, Yeah.
2140.0,2141.0," Oh, oh."
2141.0,2142.0," Oh, oh."
2142.0,2143.0," Oh, oh."
2143.0,2144.0," Oh, oh."
2144.0,2145.0," Oh, oh."
2145.0,2146.0, She's come up with a name.
2146.0,2149.0, But it's so... the thing is it's so impued with the power of the force.
2149.0,2154.0, That even though it's so... it's like... it's... it's terribly disgusting.
2154.0,2159.0, But at people who come from far and wide to try to drink it and gain the power of the food.
2159.0,2160.0," Oh, oh, oh."
2160.0,2161.0," Oh, oh."
2161.0,2162.0," Oh, oh, oh."
2162.0,2163.0," Oh, oh."
2163.0,2164.0," Oh, oh."
2164.0,2165.0," Oh, oh."
2165.0,2166.0," Oh, oh."
2166.0,2167.0, Oh.
2167.0,2168.0, Oh.
2168.0,2169.0, Oh.
2169.0,2170.0, Oh.
2170.0,2171.0, Oh.
2171.0,2172.0, I don't know how we got it.
2172.0,2173.0," Oh, oh."
2174.0,2175.0, Oh.
2175.0,2176.0, All stop.
2176.0,2177.0, Okay.
2177.0,2179.0, We got to podcast and tear.
2179.0,2182.0, We can go to... I have a full breakdown.
2182.0,2183.0, Full podcast breakdown.
2183.0,2184.0," Oh, my God."
2184.0,2185.0, Okay.
2185.0,2187.0, So we're... stuff thinking of...
2187.0,2188.0, Yeah.
2188.0,2189.0, Please.
2189.0,2190.0," No, no, no."
2190.0,2191.0, Okay.
2191.0,2192.0, We'll end that thread.
2192.0,2193.0, That's a good one though.
2193.0,2195.0, Like we should come back to it at some point because it reminds me of Wing Wing.
2195.0,2197.0," You know, like the whole story."
2197.0,2198.0, See?
2198.0,2200.0, Look at this fucking hypocrisy.
2200.0,2201.0, Remember my name?
2201.0,2202.0, Remember how he was on G-P-P-P.
2202.0,2203.0, He was on G-P-P-P radio.
2203.0,2204.0, Right.
2204.0,2207.0," When I was telling the story of fucking Wing Wing, which so clearly inspired, you're"
2207.0,2210.0, deriving a rip off piece of shit Yoda's story.
2210.0,2214.0, And he used to be a total fucking insane.
2214.0,2218.0, Because I said that Wing Wing got pregnant by sitting in the public toilet.
2218.0,2222.0," No, that's because when you were telling me about that shit, you were telling me like,"
2222.0,2223.0, via I am.
2223.0,2225.0, And you were giving me this long mythology.
2225.0,2226.0, It was like you're right.
2226.0,2229.0, You were like writing the wiki-p-dia intro about it.
2229.0,2231.0," And like, what the fuck is this?"
2231.0,2233.0, And there was so many points.
2233.0,2234.0, It wasn't just one like lactate.
2234.0,2237.0," No, we were in fucking ventrilo together, dude."
2237.0,2239.0, We were playing Team Fortress and Rory wasn't there.
2239.0,2240.0, We were both talking.
2240.0,2241.0, We were explaining to you.
2241.0,2242.0, And then he got mad.
2242.0,2243.0, He's like dude.
2243.0,2245.0, He'll try to explain the way Wing 2 is.
2245.0,2247.0," But I'm like, I think he's ready for it."
2247.0,2250.0, It's probably because it was like day one of me trying to play Team Fortress.
2250.0,2252.0, And I was getting killed every second.
2252.0,2253.0, Like motherfucker.
2253.0,2254.0, How do I do this?
2254.0,2255.0, And then you just keep hearing that.
2255.0,2256.0," Yeah, I'm stuff."
2256.0,2257.0, Like how?
2257.0,2259.0," I think at that time I was like, I don't even know how people manage this."
2259.0,2260.0, I think it's fine.
2260.0,2262.0," We're not going to, it's not, it's not flip,"
2262.0,2264.0, Flaming is just a change in perspective.
2264.0,2266.0," And that's something that's my, I admire the chief embraced."
2266.0,2268.0, I still think Wing Wing's bullshit.
2268.0,2272.0, You kind of bring it together.
2272.0,2273.0," Like, all right, all right."
2273.0,2275.0, It's a kind of a dumb and dumber.
2275.0,2276.0," Yeah, yeah."
2276.0,2278.0, Especially because it'd be so much fun.
2278.0,2279.0, Some of the many other heads of the thing.
2279.0,2281.0, I don't know what Wing Wing is.
2281.0,2282.0, Anyway.
2282.0,2285.0, So let's go into some serious news.
2285.0,2286.0, Right.
2286.0,2287.0," I wanted to, I wanted to."
2287.0,2288.0, Yeah.
2289.0,2290.0, On the lighter side of gaming.
2290.0,2292.0, I can't remember what I was asking about a rage.
2292.0,2293.0," Well, yeah."
2293.0,2294.0, Yeah.
2294.0,2295.0, Yeah. What about it?
2295.0,2296.0, Did you like it?
2296.0,2298.0," Well, I saw the same video that I did."
2298.0,2302.0," I saw on the trailer and then I had an interview with Matt Hooper, the lead designer."
2302.0,2304.0," And from what I've heard,"
2304.0,2306.0," just talking with him,"
2306.0,2309.0, it sounds like a step in the right direction for it.
2309.0,2311.0," The other thing is that even the art on the art design front,"
2311.0,2312.0, I think they got someone from Ubisoft.
2312.0,2313.0, Yeah.
2313.0,2315.0," And it's taking them away from, I mean,"
2315.0,2316.0, it games or it games.
2316.0,2318.0, They have that certain stamp to them.
2318.0,2320.0, But I think it's time.
2320.0,2323.0, They don't need another doom and they don't need another wolf and Stein and Quake.
2323.0,2328.0," And so there's yeah, while they're still monsters, while there's still big guns and things like that."
2328.0,2329.0, It's definitely different.
2329.0,2330.0," I mean, you can imagine."
2330.0,2331.0," I mean, when I heard the Ubisoft thing,"
2331.0,2332.0," I'm like, okay, this makes sense."
2332.0,2336.0, I imagine some of their like environmental paintings and things like this.
2336.0,2337.0, I think that's cool.
2337.0,2339.0, But everything is describing.
2339.0,2340.0," I mean, right?"
2340.0,2343.0, You have to play an action and see the levels to really know.
2343.0,2345.0, But it sounds good.
2345.0,2349.0," I mean, there's like some rudimentary form of an economy in the game."
2349.0,2352.0, It sounds just though it's not absolutely linear.
2352.0,2353.0, What's the basic thing?
2353.0,2355.0, I haven't read anything about the game.
2355.0,2357.0," What we know is, um,"
2357.0,2359.0," it's, this is really weird, too."
2359.0,2361.0," When I talked, when I talked to Matt,"
2361.0,2366.0, I was surprised that I got as much info as I did because there's almost like next to nothing known about it.
2366.0,2370.0," Other than that, they show these demos and the video clips that they've shown have depicted"
2370.0,2374.0," waistline like environments, you know, Mad Max type worlds where people are driving these,"
2374.0,2378.0," like, cobbled together, eating, car, crazy gonson, yeah."
2378.0,2382.0," And they've shown very, very quick teaser clips of monsters,"
2382.0,2386.0," but not do monsters, you know, kind of they still got, they got like,"
2386.0,2388.0," cleft palettes or something, you know, right?"
2388.0,2391.0," But so from from the sound of it now, it's just,"
2391.0,2394.0," just, imagine it's Mad Max type world or something, and they're like these"
2394.0,2396.0," ogres, mutant type things in as well."
2397.0,2402.0, Racing is like the primary form of entertainment kind of reminds me of like Star Wars episode one with the
2402.0,2406.0," Padres and thing in a way, you know, um, and in these various cities,"
2406.0,2411.0," they each have their own track or course, and it sounds like you can race there if you'd like,"
2411.0,2414.0," and you can get in sponsorships and things that, you know, we'll,"
2414.0,2418.0," we have different stickers and low-wiz and your car, but you also get weapons that you can take"
2418.0,2422.0," into the waistline, is you're fighting and exploring and then using the"
2422.0,2426.0," capability, and you can get out of vehicle anytime you want, and there might be times,"
2426.0,2431.0," um, as you describe it now, I kept trying to compare it to things that I'm familiar with."
2431.0,2435.0," So when you said, there might be a point of interest you'd want to exit your vehicle and explore,"
2435.0,2439.0," look for some item or respond to how calm on the ground, that sounds exactly like the way that the vehicle"
2439.0,2443.0," segments and how fly too, and it's episode's work, and he's like, no, it's not quite like that."
2443.0,2447.0," And he's like, for the most part, you don't, in some sections, you don't want to get out of your car,"
2447.0,2451.0," because that's like, just about, you know, it equates to suicide because the forces are so"
2451.0,2455.0," overwhelming. So it's like, well, it's like borderlands, you know, I mean, because"
2455.0,2459.0," cosmetically, that's another game set in this, like, wasteland, it's up that's"
2459.0,2463.0," something, another planet. And he's like, no, it's not quite like that. And"
2463.0,2468.0," the most important question I had to ask, it was like, please, God, tell me, it's not like the vehicle"
2468.0,2473.0," section in Quake 4. Any site, no, it's nothing like that at all. They're really weird about that,"
2473.0,2480.0," because you know, Raven developed Quake 4. Carmax been pretty plain that he is"
2480.0,2485.0," dissatisfied with that game, but then that same studio is making the new Wolfenstein game."
2485.0,2491.0," And like, it's always such a point of obvious pride whenever it's like, we're internally doing"
2491.0,2495.0," the next doom, you know, they're not calling it doom for whatever it is. We're doing"
2495.0,2499.0," rage. And it's like, but then they're still trying to pimp the new Wolfenstein game"
2499.0,2502.0," there too, and it's like it's Raven, but the vehicle segments and Quake 4 were just"
2502.0,2507.0," crafted their rents. But also, you know, it and Raven go so far back"
2508.0,2514.0," though, you know, Raven isn't just like random third party house to them. You know, they're practically an extension."
2514.0,2521.0," Yeah, they go all the way back to the beginning. So, right now, I could see why they would still, you know,"
2521.0,2525.0, still have be kind of defensive and protective of Raven.
2525.0,2531.0, Right. They commented all in multiplayer versus single player versus persistence or anything like that.
2531.0,2536.0," They would only say, and it was like, they wouldn't even confirm it was like, you know,"
2536.0,2540.0," co-op seems like an obvious thing in here and it's like, I agree with you."
2540.0,2546.0, That's just the kind of game that's perfectly suited for that. And that's about as far as things went.
2546.0,2550.0," For discussing competitive multiplayer elements for both rage and the next doom,"
2550.0,2555.0," the game is a kind of a game that's really, really, really, really, really."
2555.0,2556.0," Carmeck and this keynote repeatedly acknowledged that doom, three,"
2556.0,2560.0, is multiplayer was really insufficient that it was there. And that they're in this problem.
2560.0,2564.0," They, they, when you make first person shooters, there's a sense that you're expected to include a"
2564.0,2569.0," multiplayer component. And what happens then is that you either do a half ass one and it kind of backfires,"
2569.0,2574.0," and it detracts from people's perception of your game, or you go all out and then you get stuck in the trap where you're basically"
2574.0,2579.0, making like Quake Wars. And that's why they did that on their own. And it's an increasingly.
2579.0,2583.0," And despite we know how successful C84 is in Halo series and stuff, I mean, at least on PC,"
2583.0,2589.0, he's arguing that it's increasingly smaller audience that is just purely attracted to the competitive
2589.0,2594.0," multiplayer aspect of these games. But so what he ended up saying is that definitely more than doom,"
2594.0,2601.0," three, as far as multiplayer goes, but not like Quake Wars level of just total commitments"
2601.0,2604.0," and crafting the multiplayer game. Yeah, toward this genre,"
2604.0,2609.0," to me seems one that's gotten like more and more insular over the years, you know, to the point that it's"
2609.0,2615.0," nearly exclusionary, you know, that I just feel like in the old days of Quake and doom,"
2615.0,2621.0," like we could all play those games. And we all did play them. And I'm talking multiplayer, you know,"
2621.0,2625.0, where there would definitely be people who are better than others and there'd be people that would dominate.
2625.0,2631.0," But now that the barrier to entry, well, down mind, I would argue now in your mind,"
2631.0,2637.0," should be Quake 2 and beyond because seriously, from Quake 2 on, there would be people that"
2637.0,2641.0," like, you didn't be able to touch. I Quake 2 and it first came out, I could still play."
2641.0,2647.0," Well, but I think, I think there's a difference between the sophistication of players and the"
2647.0,2652.0, sophistication and complexity of the games. Right. Because part of the problem with hopping into a random
2652.0,2657.0, TF2 server or Call Duty or Battlefield is that it's no longer the case that everybody who
2657.0,2666.0," hops in is at an equal level. You've got unlocksed and you've got, in particular, you've got strategies that are now complex enough in class based enough."
2666.0,2672.0," That the idea that you're just going to hop in and be functional in a, in a broad server is just impossible."
2672.0,2678.0," And in the case of Quake 2, it's like, it's just, you know, the system itself is, you know,"
2678.0,2683.0," prohibitively complicated for some people. But so that's one big part of the picture,"
2683.0,2689.0, but then this Quake live is already proving so quickly right now. There's also the different players skill levels.
2689.0,2694.0," So you take, you know, Quake live, which is basically a port of Quake 3 that works in a web browser."
2694.0,2699.0," Very simple game. And so far as, you know, you don't crowd, you don't do all that you don't use cover."
2699.0,2703.0," You just, you have a jump button, you have like, that was the keys and you have a shoe button."
2703.0,2709.0," And yet regardless of, you know, if it's superficial simplicity, you go in there now."
2709.0,2717.0," You will not get a single kill like, you know, you will not score a single kill. If you're playing, if you're not wise enough to really choose your competition."
2717.0,2719.0, If you go in against like season players.
2719.0,2726.0," Well, but if you do get a game that's simple enough, and I would argue that TF2 tried to be that simple and it's kind of got, it's,"
2726.0,2729.0, it's made itself more complex since it launched.
2729.0,2730.0, Yeah.
2730.0,2735.0," That if you do have a simple enough game, you know, imagine a theoretical game with one weapon, right?"
2735.0,2743.0," No additional movement keys really boring game to play. Then you could at least come up with a skill system where you could say, okay, well, this is my public persona."
2743.0,2748.0," And I've played enough that I'm at, you know, this sort of magic skill level of 100."
2748.0,2753.0," This other person's at 50, you know, we, this whole true skill thing was supposed to work like that."
2753.0,2754.0, Never really did.
2754.0,2760.0," But if you make the game simple and after something like that could work, at least I hope so, because otherwise I'm screwed."
2760.0,2761.0, Right.
2761.0,2762.0, They're right.
2762.0,2764.0," You know, they want that to work for quick live as well."
2764.0,2766.0," I mean, that's just matchmaking is always an issue."
2766.0,2771.0, And then there's the ability to like just gather a group of people that you know.
2771.0,2777.0," And just because for whatever reason, most of the times like a group of friends, it just seems that their skill levels all fairly come."
2777.0,2782.0," Well, even if it's not, if you've got a good community of people, you can, the teams will self-balance."
2782.0,2785.0, You get five people in a server or 16 that are really good.
2785.0,2790.0, But also that people who are like insanely good at quick don't have any real friends.
2790.0,2793.0, They're just also insanely good at quick.
2793.0,2794.0," I mean, they're so close."
2794.0,2795.0, I'm just looking with you.
2795.0,2797.0, I see you.
2797.0,2799.0, You guys.
2799.0,2809.0," Oh, I also wonder, you know, like, it, I mean, not to disobey all, but like to some extent, like they've kind of like, I want to say they lost."
2809.0,2810.0, They've lost a thread.
2810.0,2812.0," That's also, that's too harsh."
2812.0,2817.0," You know, they were the, they were the authority on the genre, right?"
2817.0,2819.0," I mean, it was them and everybody else."
2819.0,2822.0," And then now it's, it's a more diverse field here."
2822.0,2827.0," I mean, now they have to contain with valve, even bungee on the console side with halo."
2827.0,2829.0," I mean, I think they're admirers of their conversation."
2829.0,2830.0," I mean, they play their games."
2830.0,2832.0," Yeah, they're not, they're really humble on that front."
2832.0,2835.0," I mean, especially when Carmix speaks because he's not a designer in this sense."
2835.0,2836.0, Right.
2836.0,2837.0, He's a programmer.
2837.0,2841.0, And another point that he emphasized in their keynote was that we're not looking.
2841.0,2846.0," We don't need any more, you know, genius programmers that are going to come and help us figure out some graphic solutions."
2846.0,2849.0," Like, we need level designers and we need really good ones."
2849.0,2856.0," And they're really hard to find nowadays, you know, he used to be a time when almost anyone with some degree of experience could make a doomsday level."
2856.0,2862.0," That's where you're just, you're going around through this board or you just make a maze and you put enough cheese in this maze to keep you going through it."
2862.0,2864.0," It could be guns, it could be enemies."
2864.0,2868.0," And now you want the guys that are making like the finest levels in C84, the finest ones."
2868.0,2870.0," Yeah, how much to total our norm."
2870.0,2871.0, Right.
2871.0,2873.0," And, you know, it's bio-shock levels."
2873.0,2876.0," I mean, so they want, they're saying, this is who we're looking for."
2876.0,2879.0," I mean, and, I mean, so that's like a way of, I mean, there's some humility in that."
2879.0,2884.0," That's saying, I mean, they've already got like their core 90 people that they've had for quite, you know, long time now."
2884.0,2887.0," And it's like, we're open to change."
2887.0,2891.0," The same thing with getting the art guy, you know, it's like, you can imagine."
2891.0,2897.0," It is also, you could see Carmix was acknowledging, there's the history of the company when John Romero's there and it's like,"
2897.0,2902.0," when everyone had attitudes, when everyone was like, we are, we are fucking it."
2902.0,2908.0," You know, you don't question our, and I think that whole, like, kind of, like, perspective can be just fatal for any kind of studio."
2908.0,2911.0," And it's like, we're just so fucking good."
2911.0,2912.0, We're not going to listen to anything.
2912.0,2913.0, We're not going to like change anything.
2913.0,2917.0," I mean, it doesn't mean you need to go out and like let everyone tell you what to do,"
2917.0,2920.0," but at least it, to just like plug your ears to the entire world and think you're on top."
2920.0,2922.0, That's how you find out that you're no longer on top.
2922.0,2925.0," You know, and Carmix was pretty much saying that I believe."
2925.0,2930.0," And Garnet did show me some of the art that this guy, this friend, I think he's French, the guy they got from Ubisoft,"
2930.0,2937.0," or he's French Canadian, and did look totally different, you know, some concept art for, for Rage, I guess it was."
2937.0,2945.0," Yeah, as long as it's not like, like, grotesque, you know, like things with cancer is gross and then like robotic legs and arms, you know, like,"
2945.0,2947.0," like, it always asymmetric."
2947.0,2954.0," They got one arm, but they couldn't afford to work on the other, they're like, you know, like pre-op, like real-loves sections."
2954.0,2958.0, Yeah.
2958.0,2961.0, Yeah.
2961.0,2963.0, What else do we got?
2963.0,2966.0, Is that enough on it and Quakes on and that's all that?
2966.0,2968.0, Do we need to take a break?
2968.0,2969.0, We can take a break.
2969.0,2970.0, We had break time.
2970.0,2971.0, Just kept shrugging.
2971.0,2973.0, And now he's saying yes.
2973.0,2974.0, Take a break.
2974.0,2977.0, We'll be back after all these words from all our sponsors.
2977.0,2981.0," That's for a, you know, Robert, you know, final word on half of me."
2981.0,2982.0," You know, this milk."
2983.0,2986.0, Do a commercial for Yota's milk since we don't have a sponsor this week.
2986.0,2987.0, Yeah.
2987.0,2988.0, You have to be ready.
2988.0,2991.0, You'll brought to you by Yota's milk.
2991.0,2993.0, It's delicious.
2993.0,2996.0, We're going to hit up some news items.
2996.0,3000.0," The first thing though, we checked the internet while we were taking our short break."
3000.0,3022.0," And we found out that Yota's lactate comes out like much like Peneer, the consistency of the"
3022.0,3023.0, internet.
3023.0,3026.0, And the second thing I got from IGN.
3026.0,3032.0, And here's what I get for like the last minute like pressing print on my computer.
3032.0,3038.0, But so someone named Svenson at Capcom is discussing the future of Capcom's games on PC.
3038.0,3044.0," And there's no confirmation is not certain, but they're expressing some doubts, some hesitancy"
3044.0,3047.0, and continuing to support the PC platform in the way that they have been so far.
3047.0,3049.0," Which has been fairly strong, right?"
3049.0,3053.0, You're as many before came out eventually on PC.
3053.0,3055.0, Eventually doesn't get me.
3055.0,3059.0," But beyond that devil may cry, the most recent devil may cry came out fairly soon."
3059.0,3062.0," The plans are to get the bind it, the next bind it commando out right away."
3062.0,3063.0," You know, both first."
3063.0,3066.0," Well, it's the ice game with the hell of that."
3066.0,3067.0," Oh, yeah, the last plan."
3067.0,3071.0, It's special additions came out right away on steam.
3071.0,3074.0, So here's the quote.
3074.0,3078.0," I know that you know, Phuna is on an IR both huge proponents of the PC platform and Capcom."
3078.0,3081.0, It's an active participant in the PCGA.
3081.0,3085.0, We believe in the future of the platform and that contrary to what retail data shows it is growing.
3085.0,3090.0, Our rosy prognostication decides somewhere the PNLs of Capcom is Japan's outings of the platform
3090.0,3095.0, are going to come up and they're likely to have a huge bearing on the decision making process of future titles.
3095.0,3099.0, That's my long-winded way of saying stay tuned because it's not clear yet.
3099.0,3103.0, And so what he's talking about there is that PNLs is like piracy and stuff.
3103.0,3108.0," And, no, no, I mean quick and quick, quick and easy item, but it's just like another."
3108.0,3114.0," If it's another case of piracy and like shit that was something else, I saw it quite kind of a lot of people down low in games."
3114.0,3120.0," Yeah, well, that was a story on what I think about the piracy of issues and with double make cry for,"
3120.0,3125.0, that they had claimed that there was just a shit ton of it going on for the easy version.
3125.0,3126.0, Yeah.
3126.0,3130.0," That sounds like kind of, I think often those like ports like that are often the ones that get fired and you know,"
3131.0,3136.0," people are just like I wouldn't normally buy this like Iron Man and stuff like that, but it's like let's try and,"
3136.0,3138.0, I don't know.
3138.0,3142.0," Wait, you saw people pirating games at, quick on."
3142.0,3146.0," Like, yeah, if they're there, you know, if you've ever been to the game,"
3146.0,3149.0, you can just like have to reason some people go to land parties.
3149.0,3151.0," Oh, come on, you're sharing it for me, too."
3151.0,3155.0," There were people with like 19 hard drives in a single computer and like, you know,"
3155.0,3158.0, and you weren't all pictures of Ma.
3159.0,3161.0," Yeah, well, maybe they were there."
3161.0,3163.0," People with Ma, Ma's just not their own."
3163.0,3167.0," The storage capacities like, you know, in the terabytes and it's like,"
3167.0,3172.0," the thing is that that was Google's and that you, that was Google that you ran into right there."
3172.0,3173.0, They were at QuakeCon.
3173.0,3175.0," That was the whole, that was the Google server."
3175.0,3177.0," Yeah, that was all of it."
3177.0,3179.0, That was all of the internet.
3179.0,3184.0," So, yeah, I mean, it's a fact that no, I mean, there's someone I'm not going to name."
3184.0,3188.0," It's definitely not, it's not anyone I've ever named in the context of my friends in Ben Trillo,"
3188.0,3193.0," but there's, there's someone that's like an affiliated at that group who seems to have no concern with"
3193.0,3196.0," pyriting stuff and it's like, let me pop in here and be like, what do you play in?"
3196.0,3200.0," Like Iron Man and everyone first, like, the fuck."
3200.0,3203.0," And so, how did Bigfoot be able to, like, fuck you?"
3203.0,3208.0," You know, it's like, because, but I mean, yeah, no, and no, it is like, I know he's fairly, you know,"
3208.0,3212.0, representative of a lot of like really hardcore PC gamers.
3212.0,3221.0," And that's the dumb thing about piracy, though, like anything at all movies or games or video games or music."
3221.0,3229.0, You end up looking at or listening to or playing things that you would never play or listening to or look at if you were paying.
3229.0,3231.0," So it's like, why the fuck are you doing that?"
3231.0,3232.0, Cousins free?
3232.0,3233.0," Yeah, you're just found it all."
3233.0,3234.0," Yeah, I'm found it all."
3234.0,3235.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3235.0,3237.0," Yeah, that's like a weird mentality."
3237.0,3241.0," It's like the kind of person who, like, when my grandmother had this, like,"
3241.0,3246.0," this, like, phase where she needed an intervention because I think like my aunt went to her house and her bedroom,"
3246.0,3248.0," like, she was sleeping on the couch."
3248.0,3250.0," And they're like, why are you sleeping on the couch?"
3250.0,3255.0, And they're going to her bedroom and it's like just full of like the bed's covered in like packages of brand new socks and stuff.
3255.0,3258.0," Because they're like, for sale at Walmart or something, you know?"
3258.0,3259.0, So it's like this mentality.
3259.0,3262.0," It's like, why can get something for free or for cheap?"
3262.0,3266.0," But I mean, I know so many people like that with music that they should there and say,"
3266.0,3269.0," oh, you know, I've got this 400 gigabyte hard drive."
3269.0,3271.0," It's full of music and it's got 50,000 tracks."
3271.0,3272.0," It's like, yeah, how often is it?"
3272.0,3274.0, And then they have their eight gigabyte iPod.
3274.0,3276.0, They haven't changed the song on in two years.
3276.0,3277.0, You know?
3277.0,3281.0," Yeah, I found it deadly one for me recently, which is an Amazon."
3281.0,3286.0," I know if you guys have seen this, but they have these daily specials now in their MP3 section."
3286.0,3287.0, And there's some good stuff.
3287.0,3288.0, And there's good stuff.
3288.0,3291.0," But it's like, it's like, as cheap as a dollar."
3291.0,3294.0," Like, today's it's a dollar 99 for Rod Stewart's every picture tells a story."
3294.0,3295.0, Okay.
3295.0,3296.0, He sucks now.
3296.0,3297.0, He does.
3297.0,3299.0," But at the time, nobody was good record."
3299.0,3300.0, But that was good record.
3300.0,3301.0, But that was good record.
3301.0,3302.0," Yeah, so dollar 99."
3302.0,3305.0," You know, I got the Queen's night at the opera for three nights."
3305.0,3309.0," Yeah, I was like, it's been like a trip down memory lane."
3309.0,3311.0," It's been like, if you're building a rock and roll collection."
3311.0,3312.0, Yeah.
3312.0,3316.0," And for that cheap, it's just almost impossible for me not to do it."
3316.0,3318.0," Because I, and it's only 24 hours too."
3318.0,3319.0," It's like, oh, I got to do it."
3319.0,3323.0," I did that the other day with like, it was like Hank Williams, Great Assets."
3323.0,3325.0, They had 20 songs for $1.99.
3325.0,3327.0, I'll put them literally up till midnight.
3327.0,3329.0," Like the last two hours, I was like, I should buy it."
3329.0,3330.0, I should buy it in two hours.
3330.0,3332.0, It's going to be $8.99 again.
3332.0,3333.0, But then I did it.
3333.0,3335.0," And some, but occasionally, there's some amazing."
3335.0,3338.0," When they had, they had Nebraska, Bruce Springsteen for like $4."
3338.0,3339.0, Right.
3339.0,3340.0, Right.
3340.0,3342.0, How can you like music?
3342.0,3345.0, It's not at least it's actually going to have that somewhere.
3345.0,3348.0," That should, that should be like how much MP3's cost period."
3348.0,3349.0," Like, yeah."
3349.0,3350.0, Yeah.
3350.0,3353.0, I'm paying more than $5 for some fucking files as ridiculous.
3353.0,3354.0, Yeah.
3354.0,3358.0," But to me, it's kind of an evil thing because they've, they have me hooked now."
3358.0,3360.0," Like, I can't, not know their everyday."
3360.0,3363.0," Every day I'm going like, oh, shit, what's Amazon special today."
3363.0,3365.0," And if it's something half decent, I'm going to buy it."
3365.0,3368.0," You look as digital, your bed would be covered."
3368.0,3369.0, I know.
3369.0,3370.0, That's the thing.
3370.0,3372.0, And that's another reason why I can justify it.
3372.0,3375.0, Because it's not another fucking CD sitting at the house.
3375.0,3376.0, You know?
3376.0,3377.0," So, yeah."
3377.0,3378.0, I think after that.
3378.0,3382.0," And your wife can't like come home and be like, honey, did you spend a lot of money at the record store?"
3382.0,3383.0, Because she can see you.
3383.0,3386.0, She can see the Amazon bills because we share the same account.
3386.0,3387.0, But they're for $1.99.
3387.0,3388.0, Right.
3388.0,3389.0," So, never go to say anything."
3389.0,3391.0, It's like full album books.
3391.0,3392.0, Yeah.
3392.0,3393.0, Yeah.
3393.0,3394.0, Yeah.
3394.0,3395.0," Well, that's about time."
3395.0,3399.0," I mean, it's like when I was same before and I was complaining about the prices of, you know, when it took me so long to get the wire."
3399.0,3403.0," Because the first season at the time, the price must have come down because it was like,"
3403.0,3405.0, insanely expensive and the same thing with like the war.
3406.0,3408.0," It's like, for me, it's like eBay is a solution now."
3408.0,3410.0, But it looks like keep getting everything on there.
3410.0,3411.0," But other than that, it really does."
3411.0,3419.0, It's almost like there's a point when you're kind of like encouraging people that are like on the threshold of considering like downloading to just do it.
3419.0,3421.0," Well, this is to get back to games."
3421.0,3430.0, This is the thing I have about the whole PC piracy thing is I have never seen particularly good numbers on the impact that rental market has on console sales.
3430.0,3439.0," Because of the people I know that are hardcore console players that, you know, just they're always playing something three hours every night hardly any of them buy anything."
3439.0,3449.0," You know, they're either game fly Qing or they're going down the store because they play enough that they're going to finish anything in two to three weeks unless it's something really epic like a believey and or something like that."
3449.0,3452.0, Same thing for like the the the resell market right.
3452.0,3456.0," I mean, these are traditionally, I mean, these are always like being, I don't know."
3456.0,3466.0," Look at this game. It doesn't have a microphone for some reason. I think you know about it. But it seems like the industry is always going after the read the read, you know, right selling use games and the rentals and stuff like so."
3466.0,3472.0," So, you know, on the PC there's this there's a bit of a feeling that okay, well, if I'm going to buy a believey and for my PC."
3472.0,3478.0, I'm I'm out 60 bucks right. I'm not given that to anybody. It's particularly true if it's a multiplayer game forget it.
3478.0,3484.0," You know, you're not going to buy half life to and start playing, you know, whatever half like two death mattress or something like that."
3484.0,3498.0," And then hand that game off to anybody and get any money back. So I think there is I'm not defending piracy by the means, but I think there is a natural tendency for somebody to not do that if they're on the console because I is harder obviously if they're to jump your console on all that."
3498.0,3501.0, But you can also get on the street and try a game for four dollars.
3501.0,3510.0," Yeah, imagine this I don't know if this is too far out there. The game tabs not doing so well right now. There was just a recent announcement that there is some sort of like financial trouble."
3510.0,3514.0, I think it's a really editorial stuff. The editorial but Turner is putting it up for sale now.
3514.0,3521.0," So imagine some future that where there's like, you know, they're increasing like fewer publishers say there's EA, there's Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard and stuff like that."
3521.0,3532.0," And it's like they've got the equivalent of HBO's, you know, and it's like you subscribe. So it's like I subscribe to EA online and that means like it dead space and then, you know, the equivalent of the next season like getting the wire."
3532.0,3539.0," It's exactly how it should work. I mean the game tab. I mean I understand they've been having problems, but it's been an absolute blessing for a certain cap."
3539.0,3549.0," For a certain category of gamers. I mean if you were in a venture gamer and they're still out there, you know, I mean salmon max for you know, you're $60 a year, plus everything else."
3549.0,3553.0," Plus they put fallout on it. So I'm right. Yeah, read from the night and they got a lot over it."
3553.0,3555.0, Good old games.
3555.0,3558.0," I don't think we've talked about yeah, five or ten bucks right? Yeah."
3558.0,3568.0," People have been saying that about, you know, about information downloads in general, like that anything that can be turned into like infinitely copyable data should just be sold as a utility."
3568.0,3573.0," You know, because it just doesn't make any sense to sell it as if it were a physical object."
3573.0,3581.0, You should be able to subscribe to content and listen to whatever music you want to or read whatever you want to watch.
3581.0,3585.0," Well, I mean that's basically what getting a game fly subscription is, right?"
3585.0,3592.0," You're 150 bucks a year or whatever it is by the year and you get three games, whatever they are. I just want steam to work that way."
3592.0,3597.0," I just want to give Valve, you know, right Gabe Newell, a big fat check in Sharpie and say, here's my $200."
3597.0,3600.0, Just give me whatever the hell you came up with this year.
3600.0,3603.0," They would have like, I mean, they could, but I don't know."
3603.0,3609.0," I mean, I'm to sure there are some impediments to it, but they could do a test on that, you know, it's like it's totally the order they can have both like totally good."
3609.0,3619.0," You know, in the guys at Teltael, I know are really happy with how the deal has worked for them with game tap that you know, they have a steady income stream that I have to worry about selling a box copy of an adventure game at Best Buy."
3619.0,3621.0, It just strikes me the losing proposition.
3621.0,3622.0, Yeah.
3622.0,3625.0, I wonder what's going to happen to them with this game tap fallout kind of sucks.
3625.0,3630.0," Well, they have other methods of distribution. They have steam."
3630.0,3631.0, They've got the impulse.
3631.0,3632.0, Yeah.
3632.0,3637.0," And, you know, I guess we just don't know how much of big of a the pie the game tap part was."
3637.0,3638.0, Yeah.
3638.0,3642.0," So if you guys seen good old games, got it's Gog.com."
3642.0,3644.0, Did it?
3644.0,3645.0, GOG.com.
3645.0,3646.0, And the CD project.
3646.0,3647.0, CD project.
3647.0,3649.0, The guy who made a picture.
3649.0,3650.0, Gog and May Gog.
3650.0,3652.0," They have this side, you know about that."
3652.0,3653.0, And May Gog.
3653.0,3655.0, It's one of the things.
3655.0,3657.0, You want to tell us the story.
3657.0,3658.0, Yeah.
3658.0,3663.0," It's just it's just figures from from the local prophecy that that Harold the Armageddon,"
3663.0,3664.0, Battle of Armageddon.
3664.0,3666.0, I don't think there's anything.
3666.0,3669.0, This is not the guy that I see.
3669.0,3670.0, The project.
3670.0,3671.0, Got one.
3671.0,3673.0, This is our real estate.
3673.0,3675.0, The process of the editing is Gog.
3675.0,3676.0, It's real estate.
3676.0,3679.0, We have Gog now and we're May Gog appears.
3679.0,3681.0, We have Armageddon.
3681.0,3682.0, Nice.
3682.0,3686.0," So it's still in beta, but good old games.com."
3686.0,3687.0, It's from the CD project.
3687.0,3689.0," Guys, this is their side project."
3689.0,3690.0, I'm just going right past year.
3690.0,3692.0, You should talk about scenario.
3692.0,3698.0, And they're offering it's kind of game tap at a step further because you're owning these games.
3698.0,3703.0, They've got the library of old interplay games and a library of old cold math.
3703.0,3708.0, They're going to have to start with and they're saying they're going to beef up the library by the time they launch.
3708.0,3712.0, And they're available for download for pretty but cheap.
3712.0,3716.0, And there's some great games like Fawat 1 and 2s in there.
3716.0,3718.0, And they're all patched up.
3718.0,3721.0," I mean, that's the part of the hook is that you can write it on an XP machine."
3721.0,3722.0, That's right.
3722.0,3723.0, They're not just patched up.
3723.0,3731.0, They actually run the installer runs from Gog.com with XP and VISTA directly.
3731.0,3732.0, And just plays beautifully.
3732.0,3734.0, I downloaded Fawat 1.
3734.0,3735.0, I did this on my XP machine.
3735.0,3737.0, It took like granted.
3737.0,3740.0," I was using the fastest if server here, but it took."
3740.0,3741.0, I timed it.
3741.0,3749.0, It was like five minutes from the time that I pressed the download now button on Fawat 1 until I had the load screen up.
3749.0,3750.0, And it ran beautifully.
3750.0,3754.0," And they also when you buy it, you also then have access to PDFs of the manual."
3754.0,3758.0," Then they had some other shit like the soundtrack, which was nice."
3758.0,3761.0," The Fawat, some javascript while painting."
3761.0,3762.0, You listen to it.
3762.0,3764.0, I didn't listen.
3764.0,3765.0, You didn't listen.
3765.0,3766.0, I didn't listen.
3766.0,3768.0, There was actually cool shit.
3768.0,3773.0," I actually, it's funny to say that because I fired a Fawat from game tap."
3773.0,3776.0, Like we could go to because I've been on the road.
3776.0,3777.0, So I'm trying to find crap.
3777.0,3780.0," I can play on my laptop, which is not a gaming laptop."
3780.0,3781.0, What a great game.
3781.0,3784.0," I mean, I don't mean to sound like a new mutant's allowed idiot."
3784.0,3786.0, But there goes the hate mail.
3786.0,3787.0," Oh, they're not."
3788.0,3791.0, But I forgot and I hadn't touched it since it released.
3791.0,3792.0, Yeah.
3792.0,3794.0," Well, it's going to be a lot more of that as Fawat 3 gets."
3794.0,3795.0, Yeah.
3795.0,3796.0, It's good idea.
3796.0,3798.0," I had to turn in my, my loan or laptop back."
3798.0,3799.0," It was just like a small thing, Pat."
3799.0,3801.0, But that makes sense.
3801.0,3802.0, Yeah.
3802.0,3804.0, I can imagine if I bought a cheap laptop that's mainly just for work processing.
3804.0,3806.0," And I just, I'm not going to play it all the way through."
3806.0,3807.0, But I played a couple hours of it.
3807.0,3808.0," You know, killed some rats."
3808.0,3810.0, I think this thing was like seven bucks.
3810.0,3811.0, That.
3811.0,3812.0, I had to get some new loot.
3812.0,3813.0, I think we can't lose.
3813.0,3815.0, That was my pimpage of that site.
3815.0,3819.0, But I do see when overboard talking about the day getting excited about the soundtrack though.
3819.0,3821.0, And that's when I started to call it.
3821.0,3823.0, I could sing the song.
3823.0,3826.0, That's the world on fire.
3826.0,3828.0, Keep on the.
3828.0,3829.0, I'm not.
3829.0,3830.0, I can tell.
3830.0,3831.0, I'm going to get the guitar.
3831.0,3832.0, I'm going to get the guitar.
3832.0,3834.0, It's with every next note.
3834.0,3835.0, Yeah.
3835.0,3836.0, No.
3836.0,3837.0, So it's a good soundtrack.
3837.0,3838.0, I believe it.
3838.0,3839.0, No.
3839.0,3840.0, How loud would you say you played it?
3840.0,3841.0, Many listened loud.
3841.0,3842.0, I could do.
3842.0,3843.0, You drank.
3843.0,3844.0, Yeah.
3844.0,3845.0, I did a good job.
3845.0,3846.0, You're a fan of me.
3846.0,3847.0, I did this at work.
3847.0,3848.0, I played a work.
3848.0,3849.0, Yeah.
3849.0,3851.0, So we're just used to it.
3851.0,3852.0, Right.
3852.0,3853.0, It was good.
3853.0,3854.0, Anyway.
3854.0,3855.0, Let's move on.
3855.0,3856.0, Okay.
3856.0,3857.0, Another thing.
3857.0,3858.0, This interesting.
3858.0,3860.0," Well, from the moment that."
3860.0,3863.0, Blizzard showed Diablo three at Blizzcon and Paris.
3863.0,3864.0, People's.
3864.0,3865.0, On the internet community.
3865.0,3866.0, Started.
3866.0,3868.0, The internet community.
3868.0,3869.0, What's that?
3869.0,3870.0, Where are those fuckers?
3870.0,3871.0, Let me kick.
3871.0,3872.0, Yeah.
3872.0,3873.0, Who is this internet community?
3873.0,3874.0, Yeah.
3874.0,3875.0, It's not a community.
3875.0,3876.0, It's just like a couple of freaks.
3876.0,3877.0," You know, like a couple freaks."
3877.0,3881.64," Given the rest of us on the line, a bad name, well, they immediately got to photoshopping the"
3881.64,3886.8, screenshots and show how Blizzard was ruining Diablo by having color in the Luch
3886.8,3887.8, via.
3887.8,3888.8, Retch it.
3888.8,3891.0," You know, world of devils and devilry."
3891.0,3892.0, Right.
3892.0,3897.0," I believe the term that I saw on one of the Dr. Chott was wow, gainous."
3897.0,3898.0, Yeah.
3898.0,3899.0, That's how it was being referred to.
3899.0,3901.0," Well, there was a rate that was already."
3901.0,3903.0, I wanted to draw a child gainous to Diablo three.
3903.0,3904.0, Yeah.
3904.0,3909.0, There was a rain dead Blizzard while talking to MTV multiplayer said was there is kind
3909.0,3911.0, of like just a push buttons.
3911.0,3913.0, So this is the interest of story.
3913.0,3915.0, This is a second podcast in a week.
3915.0,3916.0, I mentioned in the multiplayer.
3916.0,3917.0, It's not that I want to pivot.
3917.0,3920.0," But this is a case where like when I read this is like shit, why didn't we contact"
3920.0,3921.0, them on this?
3921.0,3923.0, But what they did is they took the screenshots to Blizzard.
3923.0,3925.0," Of course, Blizzard was already familiar with them."
3925.0,3926.0, You can imagine of course.
3926.0,3929.0," And home paint and refresh on every, you know, on the Google page with Diablo"
3929.0,3934.0," three and typed in and they just, you know, what I mean, they had some interesting things to say about"
3934.0,3938.0," they're like, you know, in some cases the lighting that people didn't photoshop just wouldn't"
3938.0,3939.0, hold up in real time.
3939.0,3941.0, It's just like it would be just too much reburnt on the game.
3941.0,3947.0," In other cases, they said, well, if imagine, you know, in the screenshot, you photoshopped"
3947.0,3948.0, it's all skeletons or something.
3948.0,3950.0, Imagine it's like a big menagerie of monsters or something.
3950.0,3954.0, And you need to differentiate them because they have different weaknesses and they have different
3954.0,3955.0, strengths.
3955.0,3957.0, And you need to immediately recognize what you're up against.
3958.0,3959.0, There's a reason for that.
3959.0,3962.0," Things pop, imagine also that you're not staring at a screenshot for five seconds."
3962.0,3964.0, But you're playing this game for potentially hours on in.
3964.0,3966.0, Do you want to be staring at this product?
3966.0,3969.0," You have low contrast, fair black and white mess."
3969.0,3973.0," And it's like, it doesn't, it's not like, you're a Blizzard opponent."
3973.0,3976.0," But it's like they just, just came back."
3976.0,3978.0, But they totally justify it.
3978.0,3980.0, But they just defined their decisions.
3980.0,3981.0, Right.
3981.0,3982.0, Of course.
3982.0,3983.0, So I don't think it's in those terms.
3983.0,3985.0," Like they just said, hey, this is why we're doing it."
3985.0,3988.0," But it's not like, you know, we didn't spend all these years developing this game."
3988.0,3991.0, And it just never occurred to us that maybe we could drop the saturation level.
3991.0,3993.0, If you'd fucking not just on the colored.
3993.0,3997.0, But the thing that kills me on this is not so much that anybody did this.
3997.0,4002.0," But what's the launch date going to be on this game when my kids are in, you know, grandchildren?"
4002.0,4005.0," I mean, it's, it's, we're talking about a game that's,"
4005.0,4007.0, you think it's going to be that long.
4007.0,4009.0, I don't think it's going to be spraying.
4009.0,4012.0," They told Sean, it's coming out next week."
4012.0,4015.0," But this is, I did get word next week."
4015.0,4016.0, Sure.
4016.0,4017.0, Here first on GFW radio.
4017.0,4018.0, The apple three come out.
4018.0,4019.0," Either way, just four teams."
4019.0,4023.0, They're going to announce it the day that two human ships.
4023.0,4026.0," They're, they're saying one week after that is when we're coming out."
4026.0,4027.0, Because they know it's going to compete.
4027.0,4028.0, Yeah.
4028.0,4029.0, They're trying to crush.
4029.0,4031.0, That's what he meant.
4031.0,4032.0, So if it had been serious.
4032.0,4034.0, I think that's all lies.
4034.0,4036.0," That's not all lies, truth."
4036.0,4040.0," You know, that we saw the sort of one run through, which was a brilliant little marketing,"
4040.0,4041.0," you know, video that they did."
4041.0,4044.0, Who's to say any of those assets are even going to end up in the final game?
4044.0,4045.0, This shit is ridiculous.
4045.0,4046.0, And it's embarrassing.
4046.0,4052.0," And I got it and props to today's penny arcade for, for roundly making fun of the, the folks who,"
4052.0,4054.0, the guy who are doing this.
4054.0,4055.0, He was the guy who was in the necromancer.
4055.0,4056.0, Necromancer.
4056.0,4057.0, Yeah.
4057.0,4059.0, Pretty much says it all.
4059.0,4064.0," I mean, to, to, to, to think that somebody's spending the time, you know,"
4064.0,4067.0, to first of all to get worked up about this.
4067.0,4068.0, This is a game.
4068.0,4069.0, This is like pre-Alpha.
4069.0,4073.0," They're, they're, they're not even begun, you know, to be done with this game."
4073.0,4076.0," I mean, when I was looking at this, I was thinking, like, imagine,"
4076.0,4081.0," shit, I don't know, some movie director, Chris Nolan, Spielberg, whoever, whatever,"
4081.0,4084.0, put out some like early teaser trailer.
4084.0,4087.0," And then you had fans like making their own, like, you know,"
4087.0,4092.0, screenshots of like how they think the movie should be because the person
4092.0,4093.0, is ruining it.
4093.0,4096.0," The equivalent I mean, is in like a Harry Potter books and stuff, where there's this, like,"
4096.0,4098.0, sense of public ownership.
4098.0,4099.0, Right.
4099.0,4100.0, Right.
4100.0,4102.0," But I mean, other than that, other than, can you think of other, like, maybe,"
4102.0,4106.0," Anne Rice and, and does, like, really popular, you know, fiction."
4106.0,4107.0," Well, Twilight, right?"
4107.0,4108.0, Right now.
4108.0,4111.0," Like, uh, you know, I, it's completely into Twilight."
4111.0,4115.0," I had to buy the new book that, as soon as it came out, and she and her girlfriends"
4115.0,4116.0," who were all around, what they mean."
4116.0,4117.0, What they mean.
4117.0,4121.0," So you're not, it's like, my, my 13 year old girl's reading there."
4121.0,4122.0, Yeah.
4122.0,4124.0," It's like a gothi, it's like,"
4124.0,4126.0," yeah, it's a gothi, you're all being in vampires."
4126.0,4127.0, Yeah.
4127.0,4133.0," It's a day, like the third, the third time I've seen an adult man reading one of those books."
4133.0,4137.0," And he was like a 25 year old guy, and he was walking down the street."
4137.0,4138.0, Yeah.
4138.0,4139.0, Yeah.
4139.0,4140.0, My wife got totally hooked on them.
4140.0,4142.0," She keeps saying, you kind of, you kind of, you kind of,"
4142.0,4143.0, get rid of this stuff.
4143.0,4145.0," I just like, I like, read the back of it."
4145.0,4146.0," And I'm like, really?"
4146.0,4147.0, Yeah.
4147.0,4148.0, I bought it.
4148.0,4150.0," I went to buy with my, uh, with my daughter, and we went to a borders and the guy"
4150.0,4153.0, behind the counter looked like he was maybe 26 or so.
4153.0,4157.0," So it was big, huge, looked like a, you know, comic book guy."
4157.0,4160.0," And I was saying, I was saying, so I hope it's good just to my daughter."
4160.0,4162.0," I wasn't talking to him and he was like, it is."
4162.0,4164.0, I got it last night.
4164.0,4165.0, And this is on the first morning.
4165.0,4167.0, So the thing had come out in midnight.
4167.0,4169.0," I mean, I really, I bet it's going to have hours."
4169.0,4170.0, Maybe it's brilliantly written.
4170.0,4172.0," Well, my fact that it's, I don't know anything about it."
4172.0,4173.0, Right.
4173.0,4174.0, This was keen vampires.
4174.0,4177.0," The point is, the point I brought it up because because there's a movie coming out."
4177.0,4181.0," And my daughter and her girlfriends are all refusing, or they're saying they are"
4181.0,4187.0," refusing to go see it because they believe that it's going, it's, it has, it's not faithful to the franchise as they know it."
4187.0,4191.0," And I've been giving your shed because it's like, well, you don't even know what's just, you know,"
4191.0,4194.0, because you're doing the same thing with Batman.
4194.0,4195.0, What?
4195.0,4196.0," Yeah, you weren't."
4196.0,4197.0," Maybe maybe other people, though, were."
4197.0,4198.0," Well, certainly people."
4198.0,4201.0, That would be indistinguishable for most in some people's eyes.
4201.0,4202.0," I mean, true."
4202.0,4207.0," Do you guys actually really feel sorry for the proprietors of these, you know,"
4207.0,4212.0," franchises, like, they have fans who are so involved that they'll spend hours of their time, like,"
4212.0,4215.0, photoshopping what they want the game out.
4215.0,4217.0," Figuring out that, like, the characters are lactating."
4217.0,4222.0," I mean, imagine if Blizzard was, imagine if Blizzard wasn't the one making the game."
4222.0,4225.0," It's imagine if, oh, say Bethesda was making the game, right?"
4225.0,4227.0, We know what kind of shit would hit the fan that.
4227.0,4228.0, Of course.
4228.0,4235.0, I just find that it's so early on in the process to be making your own screenshots to show them how it should be done.
4235.0,4237.0," It's like, why don't you just wait a little longer?"
4237.0,4240.0," We're talking about, we're talking about Palo and lighting."
4240.0,4241.0, We're not talking about Jack.
4241.0,4242.0," Well, they made it first person."
4242.0,4244.0," I mean, it's like, that's even right."
4244.0,4245.0, Right.
4245.0,4246.0, It's not even gameplay.
4246.0,4249.0," It was that to say the lighting is the train, the fear of the franchise."
4249.0,4253.0," It's like picking out like, you know, colors for your wedding with your fiance or something."
4253.0,4254.0, You don't really like it.
4254.0,4257.0," Like, find something to get angry about with your life."
4257.0,4258.0, That's it.
4258.0,4263.0," And the other people who will sit around and play Diablo 3 for hours and get, like,"
4263.0,4268.0," audibly excited when they find a sword with, like, amazing special powers."
4268.0,4269.0, Diablo 3.
4269.0,4270.0, Diablo 3.
4270.0,4271.0," Oh, yeah."
4271.0,4273.0," No, I mean, when Diablo 3 comes out, they'll come out."
4273.0,4279.0," And they'll be, like, so fucking excited about their little, like, man shopping trip into the cave of the mission."
4279.0,4282.0, Because I'm sure nobody here has ever gotten excited about a loot drop.
4282.0,4283.0, Never.
4283.0,4284.0, Wow.
4284.0,4286.0," I've never, I've never,"
4286.0,4287.0, Automatically yelled.
4287.0,4288.0," Well, Robert's not so much."
4288.0,4289.0, You haven't.
4289.0,4290.0, You're probably the mean.
4290.0,4291.0, I could never play Diablo.
4291.0,4297.0," And in fact, like, seeing the screenshots Diablo 3, the first time I've ever had any sort of, like, notion, like, that could be interesting."
4297.0,4298.0, Diablo 3.
4298.0,4299.0, Diablo 3.
4299.0,4300.0, I had it in click.
4300.0,4304.0," I had a roommate who played Diablo 2 for, like, a year."
4304.0,4306.0," I mean, without taking a break."
4306.0,4308.0, And in college.
4308.0,4310.0, And confidently a year.
4310.0,4311.0, He played it for a year.
4311.0,4315.0," And, like, you know, the only thing that he would ever do is, like, you know,"
4315.0,4318.0," wipe his nose with clean accent, throw him on the floor."
4318.0,4320.0, And order pizza.
4320.0,4322.0, And I fucking hated that game.
4322.0,4324.0," I was just, like, stare at it and try to figure out what he was doing."
4324.0,4327.0," Wait, did you hate the gamer to just hate that he was playing it?"
4327.0,4328.0, Don't hate the game.
4328.0,4329.0, I hate that he was playing it all the time.
4329.0,4335.0," And I thought that the game looked like the most boring thing you could possibly do with the computer, including Microsoft Word."
4335.0,4336.0, Out.
4336.0,4338.0, So.
4338.0,4339.0, Yeah.
4339.0,4340.0, Yeah.
4340.0,4345.0," I was like, I've had this thing against Diablo from, kind of similar experiences, like, seeing, you know, people playing."
4345.0,4347.0," And just, like, playing games."
4347.0,4351.0," Just sort of, like, you just, like, you just, like, you just clicking skeletons."
4351.0,4355.0," But it's like, when I saw the demo for Diablo 3, I was like, okay, this actually looks pretty cool."
4355.0,4358.0," There's like, you can't, I can't, like, fairly."
4358.0,4361.0," I mean, because I'm saying, you know, skeleton clicking the game, I'm like,"
4361.0,4363.0, deliberately being reduct given.
4363.0,4366.0," It's like, what I saw was like, okay, like, I'll stop being reducting."
4366.0,4367.0, It looks like I'll give it a try.
4367.0,4368.0," Like, it looks cool."
4368.0,4369.0, I will try that.
4369.0,4374.0," I'm just saying, I'm, I'm sort of disturbed by the whole, like, psychology of, like,"
4374.0,4376.0, games that are about shopping for stuff.
4376.0,4377.0, Mm-hmm.
4377.0,4378.0," Well, yeah."
4378.0,4380.0, That's like 90% of what we do.
4380.0,4381.0, They did.
4381.0,4382.0, Everything's made of me.
4382.0,4387.0," So caliber is basically like, I mean, everything is just, kill stuff to, to buy stuff."
4387.0,4388.0, Yeah.
4388.0,4389.0," I mean, shopping and killing."
4389.0,4393.0, Some of the way that you unlock the items for the character creation in so
4393.0,4395.0," caliber, like, will clearly take forever."
4395.0,4396.0, They'll take so long.
4396.0,4400.0," I mean, you know, I was like, what gets score 100,000 hits."
4400.0,4402.0," It's no different than unlocking your, of course it's not."
4402.0,4403.0," You know, it's not."
4403.0,4405.0, Ubersaw and team for just two.
4405.0,4406.0," Yeah, that's ridiculous, too."
4406.0,4407.0, And that's been frustrating.
4407.0,4417.0," And I know a lot of people that play team for tourists are like, please devise some alternative means for people to acquire these weapons that don't want to go through and farm these achieved."
4417.0,4418.0, Please give us micro transaction.
4418.0,4421.0, So I can give you a dollar to buy my sword.
4421.0,4424.0," And yeah, it's just the thing that gets to me."
4424.0,4428.0," The proliferation of the achievements, it's driving me crazy."
4428.0,4434.0," And I'm speaking to somebody who was not aunt, I was not anti-achievement in the beginning with the three cents."
4434.0,4436.0," I see, I like achievements as long as they don't mean anything."
4436.0,4437.0," Yeah, that's okay."
4437.0,4441.0," I mean, I'm more than happy to have something little go ding and a little thing go over my head."
4441.0,4445.0," Yeah, that's what that strike the tuning fork and my loins because I feel good about something."
4445.0,4448.0, I just don't want it to be what I have to do to keep playing the game.
4448.0,4449.0," Yeah, but tuning fork down there."
4449.0,4455.0," What you're using the achievements to get like, I'm not saying Val was doing this, but if, like, if you're saying their mentality was,"
4455.0,4457.0, we're going to put these achievements in here.
4457.0,4461.0, So people will play more in order to get these items.
4461.0,4465.0," You know, it's like, you should be playing more because the game is good on its own."
4465.0,4467.0," I mean, and it's ultimately empty."
4467.0,4470.0," It's because like if you're playing just to get those achievements, then you get the achievements and then what?"
4470.0,4473.0," They just keep adding more and it's like, you can say that it's like, any game."
4473.0,4474.0," That's like, wow."
4474.0,4476.0, But they're in those things.
4476.0,4478.0, It's just like life goes.
4478.0,4483.0, But those people like outnumber like Robert and I like of our type and I'm the view people.
4483.0,4486.0, You feel like you're having me crazy.
4486.0,4487.0, Get off my lawn.
4487.0,4494.0," But, but, but, but no, I do think that there's like, you know, we're talking about different mentality and there's someone that's there, like less, you know, just like,"
4494.0,4499.0, drawn into that kind of thing and it sucks in a way to see that that's just where it's going.
4499.0,4502.0," I mean, that's what's the people have spoken and that's what we want."
4502.0,4506.0," I mean, I just don't play any game for more than a month."
4506.0,4507.0, Pretty much period.
4507.0,4509.0, Like nothing.
4509.0,4510.0, Nothing for more than a month.
4510.0,4512.0, So you're just shallow.
4512.0,4513.0, I guess.
4513.0,4515.0," I'm just like, you want to play a game out."
4515.0,4516.0, I get that.
4516.0,4520.0, The game is to all play for years on end or strictly because I enjoy them so much.
4520.0,4524.0," Like, you know, the battlefield series games and company here is so cowvers because they're just fun."
4524.0,4527.0, I don't need any extra incentive other than mastery.
4527.0,4530.0," You know, and like, and just other than master."
4530.0,4531.0, I'm just thinking of the crap.
4531.0,4534.0, I've ever won absolutely missed.
4534.0,4537.0, I don't really that way.
4537.0,4541.0," So speaking of Emma, I was we done with the Blizzard and there are about three nonsense."
4541.0,4542.0, Yes.
4542.0,4543.0, Right.
4543.0,4544.0, Yeah.
4544.0,4547.0, So my final take is everybody just shut up and wait.
4547.0,4553.0," If it sucks when it comes out, if it's all like purple and gay."
4553.0,4556.0," You know, don't buy it and don't play it and go away."
4556.0,4557.0, Yeah.
4557.0,4558.0, Thank you.
4558.0,4563.0," I'm sitting on my shirt, which has my glasses, and I'm so I can read the next item."
4563.0,4569.0, Because it's a transition from Diablo and wild stuff to Warhammer on mine because Warhammer
4569.0,4584.0," got an official release date as of today, which is September 18th finally coming out after four years and one cancellation and half the stuff that it had a month ago."
4584.0,4586.0, Would you like to borrow my glasses?
4586.0,4588.0, They're there in the ground.
4588.0,4589.0, Great.
4589.0,4590.0, Right.
4590.0,4592.0, So it's coming out September 18th.
4592.0,4596.0, They announced a pricing structure 1499 a month.
4597.0,4598.0, Fuck.
4598.0,4599.0, Yep.
4599.0,4600.0, Or did you think it was going to be eight?
4600.0,4601.0, Yeah.
4601.0,4603.0, Or if you pay for 41.
4603.0,4609.0," 97 for three months, that reduces you to 1399 a month."
4609.0,4614.0, Or you can pay 77.
4614.0,4616.0, 94.
4616.0,4620.0, For six months and then it's 1299 a month.
4620.0,4625.0, Or you can give them the kidney and every free for a couple of years.
4625.0,4634.0," And then they announce some other shit like you can, you know, if you pretty order, you'll get in so you can level up a few levels before everyone before the masses get in there."
4634.0,4636.0, That same stuff that I took on in the most of.
4636.0,4638.0, So I mean it's bad normal pricing.
4638.0,4639.0, It's normal pricing.
4639.0,4640.0, Yeah.
4640.0,4644.0," It's normal, but it's for some reasons always shocking to hear because you think if like you're like really that's not that much."
4644.0,4650.0," Like I'm sure you can convert it to pennies a day, but it's like when you add in all the other accounts like Ryan suicide girls account."
4650.0,4662.0," You know, for all the things that you pay subscription for say if you got it, you know Robert you're telling me about thinking about getting an iPhone today."
4662.0,4666.0, And then you've got another thing you just talked about how you just got cable now.
4666.0,4670.0," So you know, like show time and HBO that all the hundreds of dollars on the platform."
4670.0,4675.0," And like seriously, if you get all these things, you know, they add up and then at the end of the month you put it all together and you're like,"
4675.0,4676.0, you've got a lot of money.
4676.0,4677.0, Paying is a day anymore.
4677.0,4679.0, Fifteen dollars is a lot a month.
4679.0,4682.0, I am surprised that these things are not just war hammer in general.
4682.0,4684.0, And if you're going to under $10.
4684.0,4692.0," If you're like a casual and I don't mean casual in the sense that you don't play a lot, but like if you surf MMOs and like you play this one for a while."
4692.0,4693.0, It's so easy to screw up.
4693.0,4698.0, I had a month like six months ago where I realized that I was paying for four MMOs at the same time.
4698.0,4700.0, But that's probably crap.
4700.0,4703.0, I just spent 65 dollars in the games that I did not play.
4703.0,4706.8," You're like, you know, like, suicide girls, they need non-recurring and"
4708.52,4711.16, What we really need is a suicide girls M M up they need
4713.16,4715.16, They already have this called second life
4717.4,4719.4, That's the punch line for everything
4719.88,4721.88, They're due it's called second life
4721.88,4725.88," To better Yoda do they should make a movie where Yoda does this there you go, Phil's in"
4727.08,4732.2," But yeah, I had to go and cancel my age of Conan account because I realized I just wasn't playing enough anymore"
4733.0,4737.44, And it's like and then I was like is this in pedemic is now I'm never gonna play it again because it would mean too much work
4737.44,4739.68," Well, no, because I'll do it two weeks free things six months"
4739.68,4741.68, I'll try to suck you back in
4741.68,4747.96," Like they're doing in wild right now with this amount thing right right that's pretty awesome, yeah, yeah"
4748.2,4753.96, They're letting you they're doing this refer a friend thing if you were if you get a friend to sign up for wow
4753.96,4755.96, I'm play for 60 days
4755.96,4762.88, Is that right 60 days 60 days then you get a new mount which is exclusive to just this is it like a real mount
4763.0,4768.26," Like yeah, we won imagine like it's like a zebra harvest or schemes already go to China"
4768.88,4776.36," Well, there's also like people because then you suck it. I can write about 14 for more than whatever the monthly fee is for a new person to subscribe"
4776.36,4778.36, Probably on eBay already
4778.36,4783.76, You could just start a second account right this is what people are talking about oh I can make an email account and sign myself off
4783.76,4786.36, And they act like they're cheating Blizzard too. I bet
4787.36,4789.36," Sorry, yes fuckers"
4789.76,4791.76, Don't we gonna cost me a wait
4793.64,4799.08," I don't think I've ever played a game with the subscription fee before yeah, it's kind of sobering when you do"
4799.08,4805.46, I did mine in the past couple years it's the first time I did it actually was this year was the first time lower to the rings maybe
4805.46,4808.68," Yeah, I first did that the lower the rings and I yeah"
4812.72,4814.84," Yeah, it's kind of like it's kind of scary"
4814.84,4818.16, And you like you got to remember like that's what happened to Conan. I was like oh shit
4818.52,4822.96, Like I always sweat and I'm like I got that Conan bill. That's gonna come on final right. I got to go play
4823.0,4826.8," So it made me think about it. Yeah, I get terms Conan became associating with like"
4827.68,4833.36, Like George mutility bill yeah water bill. Yeah. Here's a fucking Conan. That's why I like the second
4838.0,4839.0, I wouldn't fail
4839.0,4847.88, Come in bill. I think I know a town hall meeting this political season for like a bomber McCain and be like what are you doing about the rising Conan bills
4847.88,4849.88, Oh
4850.16,4851.52, All the citizens
4851.52,4853.52, Conan land whatever the fuck they call
4854.24,4856.04, But the shit like universal code
4856.64,4857.64, University code
4857.64,4862.72, But while we're through the roof sweet in their playing for free we need that really
4863.16,4865.28, Universal Conan for all well relief
4866.56,4871.36," Days at say well keep something trucking. Yeah, so I will see about it"
4871.36,4875.8," We'll see about warhammer, but yeah, I mean that's of course the big problem with all of these is"
4876.360000000001,4883.66, Convincing people to pay yet another bill like first of all to get the wild players to give it up give that up and try this one out
4884.0,4886.62," Well, what it when is Litch King coming out in beta now?"
4886.820000000001,4892.28," It's in beta now and right probably as soon as they can to squash everybody else, right?"
4892.28,4897.4400000000005," I mean that's what's got to happen. Yeah, you can speculate on how they'll time it or not with warhammer"
4897.96,4901.46," Because certainly warhammer, you know, I guess I still can't talk to the big one"
4901.46,4904.28," And yeah, but it is it is the big one. It's from EA"
4904.66,4909.02, You know who have a lot of money behind them. It's from mythics. They darted to Camelot
4909.74,4911.74, EA's less
4911.74,4912.74, MMO
4912.74,4917.54," Well, it's a mothman line of course is still there, but then they've got a pile of failures"
4918.1,4920.1, besides that
4920.1,4922.1, not to all the words majestic
4922.82,4927.34," Orthon beyond motor city online Sims online, you know, you know"
4927.74,4929.74, Insert that want what sound after
4931.46,4933.46, So
4933.46,4935.46," Yeah, prices right lost"
4936.46,4938.66, Bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump
4939.02,4945.1," Yeah, right held gate no it held gate so you know, they're they need a hit this time"
4945.3,4949.46, But they've got mythic is doing it and they made dark age of Camelot with still holds up
4949.46,4952.66, I think one of the great ever. I think gamers give will give them a lot of slack
4952.66,4957.86, I mean they're they're sort of core MMO audience. I think they'll get the normal blip where you know
4958.0199999999995,4964.0199999999995," Everybody who share hardcore they'll sell a million copies. Yeah, seven hundred thousand copies in the first month and then"
4964.259999999999,4967.62, Like I think we seem with age of Conan. It's a question of whether they can hang on to it
4968.0199999999995,4972.099999999999, 60 90 days later right that's a problem is that everybody goes over for the novelty factor
4972.339999999999,4976.94, Then and then everybody is there is gonna spend a month gisting wow and saying how this is the great thing
4976.94,4981.86," Yeah, and half the people like Sean will quit outright and the rest will go back to wow"
4981.86,4984.58, But that's just how I am like I enjoy it's not because
4985.0599999999995,4988.98," You know, it's like I'm it's not like I'm looking for wow or something because wow. I was never held me"
4988.98,4993.62, But I just like it's satisfying enough to me to play it in an offer 30 days
4993.62,4999.42," Right, well, I mean how many games do we all really play for more than 30 or 40 hour? I think that's actually right"
4999.42,5002.7," You know, there are a few like you know some multiplayer games"
5003.0599999999995,5008.5," Yeah, but you know, they're not it's gonna be pretty exceptional game to have you suck it up month after month after month"
5008.5,5013.14," Right, which is what wow achieved and certainly not just wow. I mean everquest and and really"
5013.14,5019.22, I mean to be fair all these MMOs have a certain amount of fans that do feel that it's enough to continue on for years
5019.22,5023.6, Right since whilst seem so hard to beat and then though makers should go out of their way
5023.6,5030.54, And then be create like a new kind of thing which would be like the wow vacation like you make a game that's explicitly like
5031.3,5035.5, From the ground up created to be the thing that you're gonna take a break from wow to play
5035.5,5037.5," Yeah, right"
5037.5,5038.5, That's great
5038.5,5039.5, Grinding
5039.5,5040.5, Not
5040.5,5041.5, Right little trash
5041.5,5043.5, That's right get away
5043.5,5045.5, Every year from my get away from the rides
5045.5,5047.5, That's a fucking great idea
5047.5,5050.5," Yeah, it's called like your dog your daughter your wife"
5050.5,5053.5, All this moving noisy
5053.5,5054.5, Or household
5054.5,5058.5, They continually distract you you spend nine months grinding an outland
5058.5,5059.5, That's time to get away
5059.5,5060.5, We'll see
5060.5,5061.5," Come, they're in"
5061.5,5063.5," Yeah, whatever, whoops"
5063.5,5064.5, But I just
5064.5,5065.5, Yang's a my course system
5066.5,5067.5, Broke mine
5067.5,5069.5, But we'll see what they say now
5069.5,5072.5," Yeah, I did something I banged it"
5072.5,5073.5, Oh
5073.5,5074.5, That idea
5074.5,5075.5, Check it out
5075.5,5076.5, You did bang it
5076.5,5077.5, I hit it with my foot
5077.5,5079.5," All right, yeah, I've only got sound in my left ear"
5079.5,5080.5, And I'm pretty sure that that's not me
5080.5,5081.5, We're going down
5081.5,5082.5, Damn it
5082.5,5083.5, Party foul
5083.5,5084.5, That's it
5084.5,5085.5, Party fouls
5085.5,5086.5," Yeah, that's it"
5086.5,5087.5, We're good
5087.5,5088.5, All right
5088.5,5089.5, I still hear it kind of cut
5089.5,5090.5, Yeah
5090.5,5091.5, But you're hearing it there
5091.5,5092.5, His always
5092.5,5093.5, Okay
5093.5,5095.5," Anyway, they have a big presence at GenCon next week"
5095.5,5096.5, And I'm sure
5096.5,5097.5, For Warhammer folks
5097.5,5098.5," Oh sure, of course"
5098.5,5100.5," All right, so and and Dragon Age"
5100.5,5101.5, Big
5101.5,5102.5, Dragon Age huge
5102.5,5104.5, Anybody thought was going to be there
5104.5,5106.5, So we'll see what they say
5106.5,5107.5, Filisting
5107.5,5108.5, Are you going to a GenCon?
5108.5,5109.5, Yeah
5109.5,5110.5, Awesome
5110.5,5113.5," Right, go straight from here to Indianapolis for five days of gaming goodness"
5113.5,5114.5, It's a good time
5114.5,5116.5, What's GenCon for the non
5116.5,5119.5, It's it's E3 for people who don't like electricity
5119.5,5121.5, Pretty much
5122.5,5123.5, It's it's kind of
5123.5,5125.5, It's kind of a kind of a whole of electricity
5125.5,5127.5," Exactly, you know there's a devil's lightning"
5127.5,5128.5, Blood I gamer
5128.5,5129.5, But there's a electricity
5129.5,5130.5, But the electricity's creeping in
5130.5,5131.5, Totally is totally is
5131.5,5134.5, I mean why is gaming taking over all these conventions
5134.5,5136.5, Like Comic Con and stuff too
5136.5,5138.5," Well, GenCon is a gaming game"
5138.5,5139.5, Video gaming
5139.5,5140.5, Just I mean it's reality
5140.5,5144.5, I mean you know role playing gamers came out of Dungeons & Dragons
5144.5,5146.5, And then discovered electricity and started playing
5146.5,5148.5," Wow, so of course Blizzard's going to be there"
5148.5,5149.5, Yeah
5150.5,5151.5, It's just because E3
5151.5,5153.5, Like they shut E3 down and it was like shutting down the bar
5153.5,5155.5, And everyone's like wandering out
5155.5,5157.5, Trying to find another way to put your hand in
5157.5,5158.5," Yeah, everybody's bombing"
5158.5,5160.5, They also show well in those kind of environments
5160.5,5162.5, Like Comic Con and stuff too
5162.5,5164.5," You know, it's like you can have someone sitting up there in a panel"
5164.5,5166.5," Right, Miller's talking or you can just have like"
5166.5,5167.5, BABYBURR
5167.5,5168.5, BABYBURR
5168.5,5169.5, Like I think the
5169.5,5172.5, GenCon has become kind of the place to go see RPGs
5172.5,5174.5, That's for a completely reasonable reason
5174.5,5177.5, I mean the best the best pre-launch stuff for the wicker
5177.5,5179.5, Whicher was all at GenCon
5179.5,5181.5, Right because it's the target audience
5181.5,5182.5, Of course
5182.5,5183.5," 50,000 geeks in a room"
5183.5,5184.5," Sounds fun, I want to go"
5184.5,5185.5, So you want it to go
5185.5,5188.5, Mostly I lock myself in a couple of sweets and play board games
5188.5,5190.5, That's just in so fun
5190.5,5192.5, That's great to me
5192.5,5193.5, I don't think that
5193.5,5194.5," Yeah, why don't you go Jeff"
5194.5,5195.5, I can't
5195.5,5196.5, Really?
5196.5,5197.5, Maybe I could
5197.5,5198.5, Well you just you were just saying
5198.5,5199.5, It's a big dragon age reveals
5199.5,5200.5," Yeah, I know"
5200.5,5201.5, There should be some
5201.5,5202.5, I'm gonna go
5202.5,5203.5, I'm gonna go to the coverage that's
5203.5,5204.5, Maybe I should
5204.5,5205.5, I've got stuff schedule
5205.5,5206.5, But see how this being something really
5206.5,5207.5, I'm playing with it
5207.5,5208.5, I'm gonna send it on to you guys
5208.5,5210.5," What board games are you gonna play, Julian?"
5210.5,5211.5, I don't know
5211.5,5212.5, Whatever's there
5212.5,5213.5," Whatever's new, whatever's hot"
5213.5,5215.5, Oh you got the whole routine there
5215.5,5216.5, As you go in the floor
5216.5,5218.5, And you see all the stuff that everybody's been
5218.5,5220.5, Making all your long and then you buy it
5220.5,5221.5, And then you take it back to your room
5221.5,5222.5, And you play it with friends
5222.5,5224.5, And then you never play it again
5224.5,5225.5," No, not true"
5225.5,5227.5, So what's the party atmosphere like
5227.5,5229.5, Totally gonna play it
5229.5,5230.5, What's on it getting ready to go?
5230.5,5232.5, What kind of hard drugs do people do
5232.5,5234.5, When they lock themselves in a hotel room
5234.5,5236.5, To play board games that have been recently
5236.5,5239.5, There are distinct subcultures
5239.5,5241.5, There are very large content
5241.5,5244.5, To people you don't particularly want to hang around
5244.5,5245.5, You got your white wolf people
5245.5,5246.5, You got your white wolf people
5246.5,5248.5, You got your you got your larkers
5248.5,5249.5, Running around through the walls
5249.5,5251.5, You know generally
5251.5,5253.5, Endocrine challenge
5253.5,5254.5, And some way
5254.5,5259.5, But then there's you know
5259.5,5261.5, There's a whole raft of cool people
5261.5,5263.5," To me put 50,000 geeks in the room"
5263.5,5265.5," Yeah, yeah, they're gonna be a thousand you don't mind hanging out"
5265.5,5267.5, I think we'd feel all feel at home there
5267.5,5271.5, I have a crew of about 60 or 70 people that we've been going every year
5271.5,5274.5, Forever and they're all remarkably normal
5274.5,5276.5, A lot of them are gained as a lot of people
5276.5,5278.5, Come from the video game industry or their press
5278.5,5281.5, And so we just rent the whole floor and I hope to see
5281.5,5283.5, I've got like five friends
5283.5,5284.5, Drink like crazy
5284.5,5290.5, And that's a friendly town man
5290.5,5291.5, It is
5291.5,5293.5, It's a friendly
5293.5,5295.5, It must be like a biker convention coming in
5295.5,5296.5, It is
5296.5,5298.5, It's very strange
5298.5,5300.5, And you can tell people are just about to jump in
5300.5,5302.5, Because it's way worse than E3 ever was
5302.5,5305.5, Because E3 first of all you're not in a little town like Indianapolis
5305.5,5306.5, Right
5306.5,5308.5, And second of all it's predominantly professional people
5308.5,5310.5, And then some smelly teenagers
5310.5,5312.5, And that's always really what it was
5312.5,5314.5, And Jen kind is just freak city
5314.5,5315.5, Self included me too
5315.5,5317.5," Right, you're not pointing fingers"
5317.5,5320.5, It's just it's all it's deep deep sub cultures
5320.5,5322.5, It's like it's like a swarm of locust
5322.5,5324.5, It comes in and within like 30 minutes
5324.5,5325.5, All of the red
5325.5,5327.5, All of the red bulls and pizzas
5327.5,5328.5, It's like gone
5328.5,5330.5, Yeah
5330.5,5333.5, But they can't like find a hamburger in the whole town
5333.5,5336.5, But it's also different because everybody's there to play games
5336.5,5338.5," Yeah, I mean they're their panels and stuff like that"
5338.5,5340.5, But for the most part people come to play games
5340.5,5341.5, It's cool that it's like you actually play the game
5341.5,5344.5, It's not just all like promotional like E3
5344.5,5345.5, There's actually very little of there
5345.5,5347.5, No big press conference and stuff like that
5347.5,5349.5, There's a lot of back room stuff
5349.5,5352.5, So like everything that I have scheduled video game wise
5352.5,5353.5, Isn't happening on the floor
5353.5,5356.5, It's happening in some suite where they've got two demo machines
5356.5,5359.5, Said right which is a much better way to do that right?
5359.5,5361.5, Doesn't traditionally why we don't cover it
5361.5,5364.5," In fact, I'd send out an email to"
5364.5,5366.5, To the one up edit saying
5366.5,5368.5," Like, hey, should we cover Jencon this here"
5368.5,5370.5, And the immediate response from Shane
5370.5,5371.5, Who was it?
5371.5,5373.5, A photo that he had gotten from Google
5373.5,5375.5, A crowd of Jenconner
5375.5,5376.5," Oh, yeah"
5376.5,5377.5, That's like so
5377.5,5379.5, You sure you want to go?
5379.5,5380.5, I got you back.
5380.5,5382.5, I think it would be fun to go there and cover
5382.5,5384.5, But it's not really like it's not gaming
5384.5,5388.5, And there will be maybe one or two things
5388.5,5390.5, The funny thing is all the knock-ups going the other way
5390.5,5393.5, So like there's a Star Wars Galaxy card game
5393.5,5394.5, Being launched at Jencon
5394.5,5396.5, It's like wofhoo
5396.5,5398.5, Big press release on that one
5398.5,5402.5," Yeah, you know and there's a never-quest card game that has an expansion coming out"
5402.5,5404.5, So it's all sort of going the other direction
5404.5,5406.5, Video game companies pushing down into the right
5406.5,5407.5, Into the train
5407.5,5411.5," I would just like to go walk around me and like, hey, you want to play"
5411.5,5412.5, Checkers
5412.5,5414.5, Do you like you like checkers?
5414.5,5415.5, I did some great things
5415.5,5416.5, We're trying to sell some games
5416.5,5418.5, Like we can go when we can make up a game
5418.5,5420.5," Yeah, we'll like make up the most"
5420.5,5421.5, That's a big answer
5421.5,5424.5, And draw all these like insane rules and try to get people to play with us
5424.5,5426.5, And as we sit down and play with them
5426.5,5428.5, It'll be revealed like it's just increasingly insane
5428.5,5430.5, But see if maybe it's going to be a real world
5430.5,5432.5, And then we can start accusing them with cheating us
5432.5,5433.5, And you got to be possibly a viewer
5433.5,5434.5, than the real world
5434.5,5437.5, I bought a game there that was totally not a joke
5437.5,5438.5, Yeah
5438.5,5441.5, Where did God five years ago called Ebala Monkey Hunt
5441.5,5445.5," That sounds like someone like trying to like, let's make something wacky"
5445.5,5447.5," Yeah, but they were totally serious"
5447.5,5449.5, And it was it got to be prepared
5449.5,5452.5," Like you're trying to, you were trying to, you were trying to like,"
5452.5,5455.5, Carry these monkeys around and infect your friends with Ebala
5455.5,5457.5, And then on a way before you died
5457.5,5460.5," It was just the most lame, crazy stuff"
5460.5,5463.5, And every year there's like six or seven of these guys that you walk by their booth
5463.5,5465.5," And you're like, dude"
5465.5,5467.5, I really hope you didn't see that
5467.5,5471.5, You should go like for us and like just try to assemble like the nutty
5471.5,5473.5," Yes, James, it's your fun"
5473.5,5474.5, You should bring a video to my restaurant
5474.5,5476.5, I do a lot of you every year I'll cut off that
5476.5,5478.5," I mean, why doesn't one have just covered board games"
5478.5,5479.5," I mean, what's the difference?"
5479.5,5481.5, It's besides a market
5481.5,5482.5," Well, we've, it's tiny"
5482.5,5485.5," A big, a big, huge print run"
5485.5,5487.5, Like the World of Warcraft adventure game
5487.5,5490.5," It kicks 100,000 units over the course of its life"
5490.5,5491.5, It was like big times
5491.5,5493.5, So we've talked about those
5493.5,5495.5," I mean, it's not out of the realm of possibility"
5495.5,5496.5, It's just some point
5496.5,5497.5," I mean, how can we do it?"
5497.5,5498.5, It's hard enough
5498.5,5499.5, I can't even do it
5499.5,5501.5, It's hard to find the stories like this week
5501.5,5502.5," It's 100,000 units"
5502.5,5504.5," Like this week we put up, you know, lower criggers"
5504.5,5505.5, Virtual Gehoddy's story
5505.5,5506.5, It's fantastic
5506.5,5509.5, Today we're Roberts story on pro game and levels up
5509.5,5510.5, Just one of them
5510.5,5512.5, It's like hard enough to get people to pay attention to this
5512.5,5513.5," It's like to feature, right?"
5513.5,5515.5, And as our critics would say
5515.5,5518.5, We don't adequately cover what we should be covering already
5518.5,5520.5," So to expand, so we can do it"
5520.5,5522.5, Much as I love it and we'd love to write it
5522.5,5523.5, It wouldn't make much sense
5523.5,5525.5, Have any of you been to packs?
5525.5,5527.5, I'm going for the first time this year
5527.5,5529.5, Anthony Gallegos is warning me that it's...
5529.5,5531.5, Your fans are going to love me there
5531.5,5532.5, Freak City
5532.5,5533.5, Right
5533.5,5534.5, That's like to go
5534.5,5535.5, You got to fan
5535.5,5537.5, And that's coming to pretty much New York
5537.5,5539.5, Everybody guesses next year
5539.5,5540.5, Is that right?
5540.5,5541.5," Yeah, it's packed east"
5541.5,5542.5, Like to...
5542.5,5543.5, Patchest east
5543.5,5545.5, I think you're right again
5545.5,5546.5, It's the east-west road
5546.5,5547.5, It's the New E3
5547.5,5548.5, Just like GDC
5548.5,5549.5, Should be fun
5549.5,5550.5, And it's Seattle
5550.5,5551.5, I love that place
5551.5,5553.5, So to get back on Warhammer
5553.5,5554.5," Actually think you should try it, Sean"
5554.5,5555.5, I would like your...
5555.5,5556.5," Yeah, I'll try it"
5556.5,5557.5, I plan to try it
5557.5,5560.5, More than most of these other MMOs
5560.5,5562.5, This realm versus realm stuff they have going
5562.5,5564.5, I think might appeal to the other
5564.5,5566.5, I'm going to be the expert on levels 130
5566.5,5567.5, And all end up
5567.5,5569.5, Along with everything
5569.5,5571.5, That's something goes to 40
5571.5,5572.5, So you're...
5572.5,5574.5, And 30 to 40 is where it gets really interesting
5574.5,5575.5, And Warhammer
5575.5,5576.5, Seriously
5576.5,5577.5, Have you been playing here in the beta?
5577.5,5578.5, I'm in the beta
5578.5,5579.5, But I can't talk about any of that
5579.5,5580.5, Any of the beta stuff
5580.5,5581.5, But...
5581.5,5583.5, What you just said it was interesting
5583.5,5584.5," Oh, you're fired"
5584.5,5586.5, You said it was interesting
5586.5,5587.5, Is that break in the end?
5587.5,5588.5, Yeah
5588.5,5589.5, I meant it's not interesting
5589.5,5590.5, Right
5590.5,5591.5, On a weight that I can say that either
5591.5,5593.5, Chef Greens is more hand-wrestling
5593.5,5594.5, It's not interesting
5594.5,5595.5, It's not interesting
5595.5,5598.5, It's my take on Warhammer
5598.5,5600.5, It merely is
5600.5,5601.5, When can you talk about it?
5601.5,5602.5, I know some...
5602.5,5603.5, I think it's IGNs
5603.5,5604.5, I don't know
5604.5,5605.5, I mean now that it's coming out
5605.5,5606.5, What did I say?
5606.5,5607.5, September 18th
5607.5,5608.5, They got a...
5608.5,5610.5, It's quit that damn NDA thing
5610.5,5611.5, So we can pimp it
5611.5,5612.5, Or not
5612.5,5613.5, We should be getting hands-on
5613.5,5615.5, With the Red Alert 3 soon
5615.5,5616.5, Hopefully we're not on Bargods
5616.5,5618.5, So we can play and talk about it right away
5618.5,5619.5, Right
5619.5,5621.5, I want to get to that
5621.5,5623.5, The other date announcement
5623.5,5625.5, Today was GTA 4
5625.5,5628.5, Coming to the PC on November 18th
5628.5,5629.5, Very cool
5630.5,5631.5, We'll have the about that
5631.5,5632.5, I am with the history
5632.5,5633.5," You know, Marronos"
5633.5,5635.5, I'm talking about San Andreas online
5635.5,5636.5, If they're able to work this out
5636.5,5637.5, Well of course
5637.5,5639.5, It's already got online support
5639.5,5640.5, So
5640.5,5642.5, And just like mod it
5642.5,5645.5, It's never a bad thing for GTA to be on PC
5645.5,5646.5, Because it's traditionally like
5646.5,5649.5, The scope of mods that come out
5649.5,5650.5, Geline DigiPlayer
5650.5,5651.5, GTA 4
5651.5,5653.5, I played not all of it
5653.5,5656.5, I probably put in 15 hours or something
5656.5,5657.5, Like that on the 360
5657.5,5659.5, But I'm just not a
5659.5,5660.5, It bugs me
5660.5,5661.5, I need to play a good guy
5661.5,5662.5, It's really what it comes down to
5662.5,5663.5, Really
5663.5,5664.5, I'm shallow that way
5664.5,5665.5, Because it's starting bothering you
5665.5,5666.5, Like morally
5666.5,5668.5, I think it just makes me uncomfortable
5668.5,5669.5, I just don't enjoy it very much
5669.5,5671.5, I don't like being a punk
5671.5,5674.5, In the sense that GTA sort of makes you feel like a punk
5674.5,5675.5, I admired the game
5675.5,5677.5, There's a ton about it
5677.5,5678.5, But all the time I was playing it
5678.5,5679.5, I kept thinking
5679.5,5681.5," God, I wish these people had made a game I wanted to play"
5681.5,5682.5," You know, because"
5682.5,5683.5, Because you know
5683.5,5684.5, The levels
5684.5,5685.5, I mean they're not really levels
5685.5,5686.5, The world designed
5686.5,5689.5, The game is really hard
5689.5,5691.5, Some of the stuff they did
5691.5,5694.5, The engine was really off the charts
5694.5,5698.5, But just wish they'd made a game I wanted to play out of it
5698.5,5700.5, They're bringing this port around
5700.5,5702.5, Pretty fast for them
5702.5,5703.5, I'd say
5703.5,5705.5, Pretty cool it's coming this fast
5705.5,5706.5, Yeah
5706.5,5707.5, Any of us finish it?
5707.5,5708.5, I finished it
5708.5,5709.5, You did?
5709.5,5710.5, Yeah
5710.5,5711.5, Yeah
5711.5,5713.5, It was a really good game
5713.5,5715.5, I was really happy
5715.5,5717.5, I was really happy
5717.5,5718.5, I was really happy
5718.5,5719.5, I was really happy
5719.5,5721.5, I was really happy
5721.5,5722.5, I was really happy
5722.5,5723.5, I was really happy
5723.5,5724.5, I was really happy
5724.5,5725.5, I was really happy
5725.5,5726.5, I was really happy
5726.5,5727.5, I was really happy
5727.5,5728.5, I was really happy
5728.5,5729.5, I was really happy
5729.5,5730.5, I was really happy
5730.5,5731.5, I was really happy
5731.5,5732.5, I was really happy
5732.5,5733.5, I was really happy
5733.5,5734.5, I was really happy
5734.5,5735.5, I was really happy
5735.5,5736.5, I was really happy
5736.5,5737.5, I was really happy
5737.5,5738.5, I was really happy
5738.5,5739.5, I was really happy
5739.5,5740.5, I was really happy
5740.5,5741.5, I was really happy
5741.5,5743.5, I was really happy
5743.5,5744.5, I was really happy
5744.5,5745.5, I was really happy
5745.5,5746.5, I was really happy
5746.5,5747.5, I was really happy
5747.5,5748.5, I was really happy
5748.5,5749.5, I was really happy
5749.5,5750.5, I was really happy
5750.5,5751.5, I was really happy
5751.5,5752.5, I was really happy

5753.5,5754.5, I was really happy
5754.5,5755.5, I was really happy
5755.5,5756.5, I was really happy
5756.5,5757.5, I was really happy
5757.5,5758.5, I was really happy
5758.5,5759.5, I was really happy
5759.5,5760.5, I was really happy
5760.5,5761.5, I was really happy
5761.5,5762.5, I was really happy
5762.5,5763.5, I was really happy
5763.5,5764.5, I was really happy
5764.5,5765.5, I was really happy
5765.5,5766.5, I was really happy
5766.5,5767.5, I was really happy
5767.5,5768.5, I was really happy
5768.5,5769.5, I was really happy
5769.5,5770.5, It was cool
5770.5,5771.5, I enjoyed it
5771.5,5774.5, but it wasn't the be all
5774.5,5777.5, What did the game-tap review say of it?
5777.5,5778.5, What did the game-tap review say of it?
5778.5,5781.5, What did the game-tap review say of it?
5781.5,5782.5, The game-tap was like Jon Steinbeck and Mark Twain
5782.5,5783.5, It was a dad
5783.5,5786.5, It was definitely like
5786.5,5789.5, The adventure bear in the adventure bear
5789.5,5793.5, The adventure bear in the adventure bear is a game of
5793.5,5795.5, a very big or something
5795.5,5798.5, The adventure bear is a big
5799.5,5801.5, The adventure bear is a big
5801.5,5805.5, I do wonder at the end of the year
5805.5,5809.5, What is the gaming press going to be saying about GTA 4
5809.5,5812.5, and the game-tap for after the end of the game
5812.5,5814.5, and the split fest
5814.5,5816.5, It's like ourself's out of that
5816.5,5817.5, Like bio-shock
5817.5,5819.5, These things are just giant things that you chew on
5819.5,5820.5, and you get through the end of them
5820.5,5822.5, Sometimes they're like Chinese food
5822.5,5823.5, That was awesome
5823.5,5827.5, Well we spent the whole press spent a couple weeks
5827.5,5828.5, to those games like
5828.5,5830.5, It's a new pinnacle in the art form
5830.5,5832.5, And now here we are in August
5832.5,5835.5, I'm not hearing anybody talk about either game at this point
5835.5,5837.5," Already, I mean are they done?"
5837.5,5840.5, I mean I'm not saying much because I don't want to rehash the discussions
5840.5,5842.5," Yeah, I know we talked about this time"
5842.5,5844.5, I was curious if Robert did finish it
5844.5,5846.5, because I know all of us for different reasons
5846.5,5848.5, We've talked about kind of hit the wall
5848.5,5850.5, But that's the other thing is people played it
5850.5,5852.5, and they even finished it and they returned it
5852.5,5853.5," We've moved on, it's not like an MMO"
5853.5,5854.5, That's going to live forever
5855.5,5857.5, I did find it perpetually enjoying
5857.5,5858.5, I didn't hit any sort of wall
5858.5,5859.5, I didn't have the same problem
5859.5,5861.5, I had with other GTA games where you hit this
5861.5,5863.5, like difficulty thing where you've got some insane mission
5863.5,5865.5, where you have to fight the controls
5865.5,5868.5," all the time to you know, look out"
5868.5,5870.5, and beat some hord of cops or something
5870.5,5873.5, It was all approachable and pretty fun
5873.5,5875.5, I liked everything I played
5875.5,5878.5, and the only reason I stopped I guess I mentioned this before
5878.5,5881.5, So it's because I had hit a mission that was just to
5881.5,5885.5, adult only audience for me to play in front of my wife
5885.5,5887.5, kids so you know
5887.5,5888.5, What was it?
5888.5,5891.5, It was having a kill everybody at the strip club
5891.5,5892.5," Oh okay, yeah"
5892.5,5894.5, It was combining two things
5894.5,5897.5," You know, strip club and murdering everybody"
5897.5,5899.5," Yeah, that could be kind of awkward"
5899.5,5901.5, in front of our kids
5901.5,5903.5," Everything else though, no problem"
5903.5,5905.5, He had the three-year-old niece there
5905.5,5907.5, Yeah
5907.5,5910.5, But it isn't my head to go back to it
5910.5,5911.5, Yeah
5911.5,5912.5, I wasn't drawing what I played
5912.5,5914.5, I didn't mean a disc detafore
5914.5,5915.5, just fine that's interesting
5915.5,5917.5, that the discussion completely dried up
5917.5,5919.5, but maybe that's just what happens
5919.5,5922.5, It's funny for me like that came to me so uneven
5922.5,5924.5, and the brilliant parts of it
5924.5,5926.5, make you expect more out of it
5926.5,5927.5," you know, like the writing"
5927.5,5929.5, could be like really impressive
5929.5,5931.5, or just totally
5931.5,5933.5, fucking lame
5933.5,5935.5," you know, bro, frapp boy jokes"
5935.5,5936.5, you know
5936.5,5937.5, Yeah
5937.5,5939.5," How many, one of your cookies?"
5940.5,5941.5, Okay
5941.5,5943.5, I was really good
5943.5,5944.5, Yeah
5944.5,5947.5," We have, we have been getting candy"
5947.5,5948.5, we continually
5948.5,5949.5, Oh yeah
5949.5,5951.5," thank our listeners, you sent us candy from around the world"
5951.5,5953.5," I got Jeff, by the way, again, a follow-up"
5953.5,5954.5, on the Taiwanese batch
5954.5,5956.5, I got Jeff and then the rest of the floor
5956.5,5959.5, today to finish the bag of like
5959.5,5961.5," I don't know, they were like these gooey plums"
5961.5,5962.5, and a sack
5962.5,5964.5, and then we got pictures of you up on community
5964.5,5966.5, and your team is blog eating one
5966.5,5968.5, I don't think there was bad as your face made it look
5968.5,5970.5," Yep, that shit was bad"
5970.5,5972.5, I wasn't making a face for the flow
5972.5,5973.5," Yeah, for the flow"
5973.5,5975.5," Yeah, the thing is, here's a candy"
5975.5,5976.5, and I bite into it
5976.5,5978.5, there's a fucking pit inside of it
5978.5,5979.5, like a hard pit
5979.5,5981.5, It's a piece of fruit
5981.5,5982.5," It was like, what went in"
5982.5,5983.5, and what went in and out
5983.5,5985.5," When it's sticky, the smelly thing was in your hand"
5985.5,5986.5, Yeah
5986.5,5988.5," You were like, this is in the starburst"
5988.5,5989.5, like you
5989.5,5990.5, You're just like
5990.5,5993.5, It really kind of had the shape of like a jelly
5993.5,5995.5," you know, you see gross me out"
5995.5,5996.5, just a look of it
5997.5,6001.5," I can't get it, I can't get it"
6001.5,6003.5," I can't get it, I can't get it"
6003.5,6007.5, and then what was this Negro candy you brought me
6007.5,6009.5," Negro, come from me, let me say"
6009.5,6011.5, That's what it is called
6011.5,6012.5, That you never talk like that
6012.5,6013.5, I'm podcast
6013.5,6015.5, It's like the word
6015.5,6017.5, I'm not just not the script
6017.5,6019.5, That was actually the brand name
6019.5,6021.5, Perhaps it's Negro
6021.5,6022.5, I don't know
6022.5,6023.5, I don't know
6023.5,6025.5, I don't listen to a whole box candy
6025.5,6027.5, I don't know
6027.5,6029.5, I don't know how to do it
6029.5,6031.5, I don't know the first thing about
6031.5,6032.5, Pranam's language
6032.5,6034.5, But here's the letter
6034.5,6035.5, We're free from him
6035.5,6037.5," He says, hello"
6037.5,6039.5, And who can do a good dust
6039.5,6041.5, We can actually
6041.5,6043.5, Nobody
6043.5,6045.5, We don't know what that is
6045.5,6047.5, We don't need to do it
6047.5,6048.5," He says, hello"
6048.5,6049.5, And welcome GF radio
6049.5,6051.5, Crew to your box of candy
6051.5,6053.5, I
6053.5,6055.5, Please take this box of candy
6055.5,6057.5, And it's inhabitants as a gift
6057.5,6058.5, For your successful transition
6058.5,6059.5, And great coverage
6059.5,6060.5, What's your name?
6060.5,6061.5, There's snake in there
6061.5,6062.5," No, but I'm thinking"
6062.5,6063.5, The inhabitants might be
6063.5,6065.5, There was a pez dispenser
6065.5,6067.5, The shape of a character
6067.5,6069.5, From a pirate to the Caribbean
6069.5,6071.5, And I want to thank you
6071.5,6072.5, But unfortunately
6072.5,6074.5, I don't know the first thing about pronouncing
6074.5,6075.5, And the various accent marks
6075.5,6076.5, Used in this but
6076.5,6078.5, But during your name
6078.5,6079.5," Sorry, it's like"
6079.5,6081.5, Emma actually I just won't butcher it
6081.5,6082.5, There's a nickname
6082.5,6084.5, It's a little bit of a lady
6084.5,6086.5, But it's M.A.T.E.V.Z
6086.5,6088.5, And you know what the accent
6088.5,6090.5," Mark, I don't know"
6090.5,6092.5, It's such an exotic accent that we can't even say
6092.5,6094.5, I don't even want to try
6094.5,6096.5, Because I honestly know it's going to be nothing like it
6096.5,6098.5, It's like you know when you read like
6098.5,6100.5, Who's what was Pope Jump Hall's name before he
6100.5,6102.5, became the Pope?
6102.5,6103.5, Don't look at me
6103.5,6104.5, I'm the Jew in the room
6104.5,6105.5, Probably looking at me
6105.5,6106.5, Marky McGee
6106.5,6108.5, I try and then like I hear it on the BBC
6108.5,6109.5, or something like well
6109.5,6111.5, Get the thing I bothered
6112.5,6113.5, I just don't bother
6113.5,6115.5, I need to learn
6115.5,6117.5, But so thanks so much for the candy
6117.5,6119.5, And there's a lot of good stuff in there
6119.5,6121.5, The Negers will get it
6121.5,6123.5, That's like I'm not joking
6123.5,6124.5, They were good there
6124.5,6126.5, You could lip this in like there's another one that was like licorice
6126.5,6128.5, Is there something inside of it because I saw this
6128.5,6129.5, They kind of like cough chips in there
6129.5,6130.5, Yeah
6130.5,6131.5, It's a hard thing
6131.5,6132.5, Yeah
6132.5,6133.5, Yeah
6133.5,6134.5, I like the licorice
6134.5,6135.5, She chewy thing
6135.5,6136.5," Yeah, I don't know what's going on"
6136.5,6138.5," Yesterday, Tina, our community manager"
6138.5,6139.5, She was locked in
6139.5,6140.5, I was behind closed doors
6140.5,6142.5, And my office because I was trying to write something
6142.5,6143.5, And she knocks on the door
6143.5,6144.5, I opened it up
6144.5,6145.5, And she says
6145.5,6146.5, Don't be mad at me
6146.5,6147.5, Sean Elliott told me to do this
6147.5,6149.5, She takes one of those
6149.5,6151.5, Negro candy wrappers
6151.5,6153.5, And tapes it to my monitor
6153.5,6154.5, So it's taped
6154.5,6155.5, You know facing me
6155.5,6156.5, Just as Negro
6156.5,6159.5, And I left it up there for about ten minutes
6159.5,6162.5, The box also came with two packs of salivinians
6162.5,6163.5, Non-filter cigarettes
6163.5,6164.5, So Anthony got this guitar
6164.5,6166.5, He plays like
6166.5,6167.5, Classco guitar
6167.5,6168.5, He had it in here
6168.5,6169.5, I told him
6169.5,6171.5, I flung open your door
6171.5,6173.5, And I had him walk in playing this like song
6173.5,6175.5, And then I came in with the
6175.5,6177.5, The pack of cigarettes with a single one
6177.5,6178.5, Extended and offered it to you
6178.5,6179.5, And I was like singing
6179.5,6180.5," Yeah, it was just what I thought"
6180.5,6181.5, I think it was weird
6181.5,6183.5, Like I kind of spaghetti western
6183.5,6184.5, Mom's like
6184.5,6186.5, He's walking serenading me with him holding a cigarette
6186.5,6189.5, So I'm kind of a pungged candid camera
6189.5,6190.5, Mom and I'm like
6190.5,6192.5, Oh fuck's gone on
6192.5,6194.5, So who's going to smoke the cigarettes
6194.5,6196.5, I'll try one
6196.5,6197.5, Jeff will have one
6197.5,6198.5, Well before we went in
6198.5,6200.5, It seems like Jeff has his door
6200.5,6201.5, He doesn't look happy
6201.5,6203.5, I'm like like this ain't gonna fucking make him happy
6203.5,6204.5, I did
6204.5,6206.5, I was riding something for EGM
6206.5,6207.5, I wasn't happy
6207.5,6208.5, Yeah
6208.5,6209.5, It's not that I don't like them
6209.5,6210.5, I did
6210.5,6211.5, Find magazine
6211.5,6212.5, Vailable now goodbye
6215.5,6217.5, So we need to I don't want to
6217.5,6218.5, I don't want to I don't need to
6218.5,6220.5, Apothe's for this Negro thing
6220.5,6221.5, Do I?
6221.5,6223.5," No, I'm just in front of you"
6223.5,6224.5, Just in case
6224.5,6225.5, I'm just in case
6225.5,6227.5, Let me just say that what that was
6227.5,6228.5, The name of the candy
6228.5,6229.5, Yeah
6229.5,6231.5, I've got Al Sharpton on my quick death
6231.5,6233.5, I just mean black
6233.5,6234.5, It just means black
6234.5,6236.5, I think the original candy
6236.5,6237.5, Probably was licorice
6237.5,6238.5, It was black
6238.5,6240.5, And then they branched out with other kinds
6240.5,6241.5, And that's one of some of them
6241.5,6242.5, Like green
6242.5,6243.5, And that's what's funny
6243.5,6245.5, It's like when you got a bag of obviously green candies
6245.5,6247.5, And it's called like Negro or whatever
6247.5,6248.5, It's called yeah
6248.5,6249.5, And it's also from Slovenia
6249.5,6250.5, It's not we're not talking about
6250.5,6251.5, Like the shit from a gerator or something
6251.5,6252.5, You know
6252.5,6253.5," Right, but it was just weird"
6253.5,6255.5, When you tell me to come in and look at the stuff
6255.5,6257.5, And I saw from far away the name
6257.5,6258.5, I thought for sure
6258.5,6259.5, That was going to be like some sandbow
6259.5,6260.5, Character on the thing
6260.5,6262.5, I thought it was going to be actually
6262.5,6264.5, But it had nothing to do with it
6264.5,6266.5, It has a chimney sweeper on it
6266.5,6267.5, It's weird
6267.5,6269.5, There's this like a photograph of a chimney sweeper
6269.5,6271.5," Yeah, what's the way to put on your candy"
6271.5,6272.5," Yeah, and that you know"
6272.5,6273.5, It tastes like ash
6273.5,6278.5, Just something weird about it
6278.5,6279.5, I don't know
6279.5,6280.5, Now you see
6280.5,6281.5, You see it
6281.5,6283.5, You see it's like a
6283.5,6284.5, I didn't have any of those
6284.5,6286.5, I had some sort of licorice chewy thing
6286.5,6288.5, And I had something that called itself toffee
6288.5,6290.5, But tasted like like starburst
6290.5,6293.5, But like some sort of crazy flavor that tasted like
6293.5,6295.5, Like if the re-clarb are the re-clarb
6295.5,6297.5, Like the bowl is horned into a starburst
6297.5,6299.5," Yeah, I don't kind of like"
6299.5,6300.5, Urbola
6300.5,6301.5," Yeah, yeah, yeah"
6301.5,6302.5," Yeah, yeah, yeah"
6302.5,6303.5, This is pretty weird
6303.5,6304.5, But I have like six of them
6304.5,6306.5," Yeah, I think the Taiwanese candy"
6306.5,6309.5, There was a bag of like I think it was like dried salted shredded
6309.5,6310.5, Plum
6310.5,6311.5, Plum
6311.5,6314.5, But they looked I was telling everyone that it was like
6314.5,6316.5, Decicated sea slug and
6316.5,6318.5, Not even slug snails
6318.5,6320.5, Like just a little because they're small enough
6320.5,6322.5, You know that they're pulled off at low tide and like
6322.5,6324.5, No one would try that
6324.5,6326.5, Real like
6326.5,6328.5, I was like
6328.5,6331.5, Like it was you know like big league chew or something
6331.5,6334.5, Those are guy on our boards who said he was going to send us some English sweets
6334.5,6336.5, We've got some before
6336.5,6338.5, I've already spoken with
6338.5,6339.5, What are English sweets sweets?
6339.5,6341.5, I don't know but they must do something horrible
6341.5,6342.5, You're teased
6342.5,6343.5, What are the people that are
6343.5,6345.5, And you guys see that a half of the sense
6345.5,6347.5," Yeah, that's a half of the sense"
6347.5,6349.5, It's what our friends are with their call candy
6349.5,6354.5, But they make their they are the makers of right now
6354.5,6356.5, My number one I'm trying to like rank the world
6356.5,6360.5, Like you got to send me the prove that your country's got the best candy
6360.5,6362.5, You throughout a little racket he's got going
6362.5,6364.5," Yeah, there's shit right now"
6364.5,6365.5, Right now
6365.5,6367.5, Especially if you're listening in Switzerland
6368.5,6371.5, Right now though the round trees fruit gum
6371.5,6372.5, It's like my favorite
6372.5,6374.5," Yeah, that's the best shit"
6374.5,6376.5," Yeah, I literally ordered some chocolate"
6376.5,6379.5, I'm disappointed by I was just talking to the chocolate
6379.5,6381.5, I am so my I am too
6381.5,6383.5, Well
6383.5,6385.5, There's chocolate in the batch from Slovenia
6385.5,6386.5, Really?
6386.5,6387.5, I've been chocolate
6387.5,6389.5, Every time I'm not and also for the listeners who sent it
6389.5,6391.5, I don't just sit there and hoard this stuff
6391.5,6392.5, I encourage everyone on the floor to come in and
6392.5,6393.5, He does
6393.5,6394.5, And grab it
6394.5,6395.5," Yeah, and he makes sure you watch us"
6395.5,6398.5, Like as we look through his candy and tells us what we can't
6398.5,6400.5, He only breaks the ground stuff
6400.5,6403.5," No, I do have these desiccated yeast"
6403.5,6406.5, The rule is you come into the office to get the good stuff
6406.5,6408.5, And you don't come then I come to you
6408.5,6409.5, Right
6409.5,6411.5, But when you come by it's sort of like the guy is like
6411.5,6412.5, Oh God smell this
6412.5,6413.5, Yeah
6413.5,6415.5, Like why would I
6415.5,6417.5," Yeah, you're just eat this"
6417.5,6418.5," Well, there's like hell now"
6418.5,6420.5, What was the part of Reakings shit call?
6420.5,6423.5, I forgot that like you what we found out
6423.5,6425.5, You're supposed to spit it out and there's someone's hair
6425.5,6427.5, And as you spit
6427.5,6428.5, You what?
6428.5,6430.5, It's like a close-up of the word for what this thing is
6430.5,6431.5, And you say that
6431.5,6432.5, Ha
6432.5,6433.5, Harbor it was like a little paper
6433.5,6435.5, It was a construction paper
6435.5,6437.5, Tube filled with just like cornmeal
6437.5,6439.5, Like a little bit of sugar to sweeten it
6439.5,6441.5, And as supposed to be candy and Puerto Rico
6441.5,6443.5, But it's like I forgot the name so I wrote in
6443.5,6445.5, And another Puerto Rican listener
6445.5,6447.5, Explain what it's called and they said that yeah
6447.5,6448.5, Like you kids take this
6448.5,6450.5, You fill your mouth with it
6450.5,6451.5, And then you go behind someone
6451.5,6453.5, And you spit you spit it all over their hair
6453.5,6455.5, And it dries like cement and then you spit out
6455.5,6457.5, You say then go feel you go like that
6457.5,6459.5, That sounds like total thinking bullshit
6459.5,6462.5," Yeah, because we got to do you have W guys"
6462.5,6463.5," Yeah, that's yeah"
6463.5,6464.5, It's a little bullshit
6464.5,6467.5, Multiple multiple people then confirmed it
6467.5,6468.5, Much of relatable
6468.5,6470.5, So it's free for candy
6470.5,6471.5," Yeah, free for candy"
6471.5,6474.5, I'm a pretty fucking ridiculous
6474.5,6478.5, I have that package and I made sure other people ate their
6478.5,6480.5," Yeah, a brave man with this firm candy"
6480.5,6483.5, Now that we're pimping now that we're trying to get free candy and stuff
6483.5,6485.5, I mean what meaning to pimp
6485.5,6488.5, Like this sounds like the saddest thing that I have a Twitter account
6488.5,6491.5, And it's even like I should be embarrassed on pimping it
6491.5,6493.5, But my thing in my rules like it's not like
6493.5,6495.5, Guys here's what I'm having for lunch
6495.5,6497.5, You're like guys here's like you know
6497.5,6499.5, I don't know I woke up my neck with sore whatever kind of shit
6499.5,6503.5, It's like it's just a link dump for all the kind of things that I normally send people on the internet
6503.5,6505.5," Yeah, but it's all like a very tiny URL"
6505.5,6507.5, So it's completely blind
6507.5,6508.5, It's a so no idea what you're getting at
6508.5,6510.5, It's like a URL grab bag
6510.5,6512.5," Yeah, and so like I encourage people to go"
6512.5,6513.5, It's just like
6513.5,6517.5, But he can't be held responsible for if you lose your job
6517.5,6518.5, Just assume it's not safe
6518.5,6520.5," No, I work Mark fam"
6520.5,6523.5, I will mark things not safer work
6523.5,6526.5, But like the deal we all work at different places
6526.5,6530.5, I work in abatement
6530.5,6536.5, So I'll try to mark anything that's obviously offensive
6536.5,6540.5, But it's like I'm now spreading my aim links with the world
6540.5,6543.5," So yeah, nice trying to get you on the day"
6543.5,6545.5, This is not how responsible
6545.5,6547.5," Yeah, it's not a point of really stuff"
6547.5,6551.5, Well then like there's more like I'll put like do not click like if the prefixes do not click
6551.5,6553.5, Really don't
6553.5,6555.5, Don't you know
6555.5,6558.5, Didn't like you posted because there's someone that's going to be curious
6558.5,6564.5, Like the one with the guy that the partially sex change chance
6564.5,6567.5, That's actually with the bottle of whiskey up his ass and it's like flipping
6567.5,6569.5, He looks like de-snighter
6569.5,6573.5, And he's like holding out a banner that says get her that between two middle fingers
6573.5,6577.5, But that's like that's as bad as it's ever gotten
6577.5,6581.5, The most most funnier interest hitting the end of the podcast
6581.5,6584.5, So you're it's sharing that way
6584.5,6587.5, As a way of showing us that it never goes that crazy
6587.5,6590.5, But that's the worst thing I've ever put up
6590.5,6592.5, I mean that was do not click though
6592.5,6595.5, But you're just thinking about your link showing
6595.5,6599.5, Yesterday I'm sitting in my office and he sends me one of these and it's
6599.5,6602.5, It's an Obama in a Superman shirt thing
6602.5,6605.5, Right or ripping open his shirt to show Superman logo
6605.5,6607.5, He's wearing it. Oh right. Okay
6607.5,6610.5, So he sends me that and I look at it and I'm just like haha
6610.5,6612.5, And then he's like what is that remind you of?
6612.5,6616.5, So so I click on the link and it's Obama and it's just like okay few
6616.5,6618.5, This wasn't a sense of a gross or disgusting
6618.5,6621.5, And I'm this is going to make me want a gag like half the other link
6621.5,6623.5," No, do come on they're not like that"
6623.5,6625.5," Okay, so it's sort of the link"
6625.5,6630.5," No, but then he says okay, so what is his remind you of and I'm just like I don't know"
6630.5,6634.5, Superman too. I don't know and then so I say what it was yeah
6634.5,6637.5," Yeah, so you know he's like holding his shirt like open you know"
6637.5,6641.5," No, but there's a oh he's got a job in Sydney and he's like for Obama"
6641.5,6643.5, I'm making a sure
6643.5,6645.5," Right, so you guys"
6645.5,6649.5," Oh, it was it was it a real thing like is it real?"
6649.5,6654.5, He lost the he paints for he did the kingdom comforts he's he's unintentional guilty
6654.5,6659.5," Yeah, but yeah, it's ridiculous. I can't believe Alex Ross painted this and it's like a hundred percent like a goat's a treat"
6659.5,6661.5, Like it's like outspro-
6661.5,6666.5, I never would have thought that in a million years really until you said that and then I couldn't unsee it
6666.5,6671.5, And then I was grossed out someone should make a goat's he's shit where it's not the explicit thing
6671.5,6676.5, But just two hands in a circle so that like only people who know what it is
6676.5,6681.5," Could ever walk by and be disgusted and then you would know yeah, like you're walking down the street and you see someone make a face"
6681.5,6682.5, You're like
6682.5,6687.5," Ha, I know that you have seen goatsie two hands like fight-nover a giant cheerier"
6687.5,6693.5, They're like a whole wiki page on this that has like all of these obscure ghosts
6693.5,6697.5," Yeah, it's like found ghosty. Yeah, it's like naturally occurring go to"
6697.5,6704.0," I can't even yeah, but that was neat like that was just super tame like that was just like a throw away like but it was just like 40"
6704.0,6706.0, I know but you wrecked my day anyway
6708.0,6717.0, It's not as bad as the glink you're sitting around like last year about the girl like accidentally losing her bowels and a hot tub
6717.0,6721.0, That was that was just funny
6721.0,6729.0," No, that was that I laughed at that was funny then that was funny because it was all like a model chicken of bikini"
6729.0,6731.0, Yeah
6731.0,6735.0," Yeah, it's like funny like see if it was just like a sickle person it wouldn't be funny"
6735.0,6742.0," It would be sad right? Yeah, but it was funny because it was like you know she would recover from it. You know it's like she's used to getting all this attention all the time"
6742.0,6747.0, And it's like she finally got a taste of what's like to be the rest of us. You just start we can't help it
6747.0,6751.0," Well, yeah, not all of us have done that"
6751.0,6758.0, Don't don't lump me into that you were the one who's all excited about the about the what is it called the hot tub party?
6758.0,6760.0, The hot tub party what did they call it?
6760.0,6762.0, Hold on. I
6762.0,6764.0, I was not with the key. I was not
6764.0,6766.0, Quarter-quote excited
6766.0,6770.0, It's it's virtually you were excited about the hot tub release party. I
6770.0,6772.0," Well, I beg your part"
6772.0,6774.0, Clare occasionally
6774.0,6779.0," On the checklist. No, no party and Berkeley. It was listed as a hot tub release party"
6779.0,6787.0," What would they release it you clicked it? Yeah, what do you think? Yeah, so we clicked it with my dude my free CDs Jeff already explained how he's attracted like cheat music"
6787.0,6789.0, So you know
6789.0,6796.0," Like I'm gonna get in this thing, but then you read the whole description it was basically yeah like everyone simultaneously evacuates their bells"
6796.0,6800.0," Yes, oh, it's wasn't a release party like the new Harry Potter coming out here"
6800.0,6804.0," I thought we were getting back to video game. Yeah, what was I think it did take it to the was it for real?"
6804.0,6808.4, I don't it's so how do you know it was probably a Sean Alticad for
6810.0,6813.76," Well, the one the classic one about the old guy. I posted that's right"
6813.76,6817.76, What you think about the old guy who's taking a picture of himself and he's got a picture of a model train
6817.76,6824.76, And it's like telling people to come over and like stop on the train like their Godzilla and get the free crab meat and like have a like a chill
6825.76,6826.76, And then like
6826.76,6832.56," Okay, so when you leave I got a bunch of imitation crab meat and the freezer is like it's not bad. We just got too much of it"
6832.76,6836.76," You take that with you that that was a KRAB. Yeah, that was from"
6837.76,6845.96," That was you that was a snow wasn't for me, but it was something awful account that the person who's like has like a special genius for making a"
6846.76,6847.76, Fake craigsand this dead
6848.76,6852.76, Did you see that there was it was kind of genius because it was so sad that it seemed real
6852.76,6858.76," Yeah, it was like well he's like that it all this like specificity that starts off. It's like you age 22 to 7"
6859.76,6867.76," But it's like yeah, no the specificity is like do not contact me for like solicitation right. Yeah, they kind of very real looking yeah"
6868.76,6874.76, Did you see that last Sunday the New York Times magazine had a feature on on the trolling
6875.76,6885.76, Talked out these guys for like four-channel and stuff and sort of examine the the phenomenon of people like ganging up and doing these like real life bullying things
6885.76,6890.76, And this is pretty interesting like they talk about something I'd never heard of this kid
6890.76,6897.76," Well, who's that bullying like the dude who was hungry for imitation crab and the like jack off and oh he's got zill. Yeah, I'm no none of that"
6897.76,6900.76, And that's I'm not trying to classify it all as bullying
6900.76,6905.76," I mean, there's obviously some stuff that's like amazingly hilarious awesome internet content"
6905.76,6911.76, And then stuff that they across is the line because they were talking about you know this this teenage kid who had killed himself
6912.76,6919.76, And they were going through this kid's my space page and saw that that he had posted about someone stealing his iPod
6919.76,6926.76, And so everyone on four-channel decided oh he killed himself because someone still has iPod and they started making all of these all of these
6926.76,6933.76, Photos shops about it and stuff and people start like calling the dudes family about it
6933.76,6936.76," That stuff fucked up. Yeah, that's entirely different"
6937.76,6943.76," Like I'm serious. I'm not just like saying that like smirk. I think that's garbage. You know, I think it's totally different"
6943.76,6950.76," It sounds like an interesting story. I want to read it. Yeah, it's so different. I don't like making up the story of this guy who actually doesn't exist"
6950.76,6954.76, But who's got his kids model real real training. He's just like hungry for a little while
6954.76,6962.76," And we all know the difference between goofing off an actual bullying griefing so yeah, I think I hope let it be"
6962.76,6968.76," Nevertheless, I still feel like talking about Zutai. You know what we waste something a little more whole sun talking about all that shit"
6968.76,6974.76," But I was like we had like I meant to ask Robert about the sport prototype stuff, but but instead we wasted this time"
6974.76,6982.76, I'm sorry. Sorry. That was another story. They just went up on on our site on the site being one up there. You should read it
6982.76,6987.76," It's still on if you go to the PC or GFW doors, it's still so you don't there. So, but it's let you run it down"
6987.76,6989.76, It's just about how
6989.76,6996.76," You know from a couple of weeks ago until the release of sport, they're releasing they're going to for a sort of promotional purposes"
6996.76,7006.76, And just for people who are interested release a bunch of prototypes that the sports team made when they're sort of in the conceptualization stage of sport
7006.76,7014.76," And it's cool because they're not exactly like games. I mean, actually the two that they have a bright now are really kind of hard to understand"
7014.76,7019.76, Software programs that are sort of made to simulate things that they were thinking about simulating in the game
7019.76,7026.76, But it's pretty interesting to see what they were considering putting into the game because one of the one of the prototypes is called
7026.76,7030.76, Particle man and it was this sort of I just
7030.76,7036.76, Way to test this idea that one of the designers had that players should be able to to build planets by
7036.76,7041.76, By sort of sculpting them like a sort of like a potter's wheel
7041.76,7046.76, So you make your own planet by like going out to where there's a bunch of star dust and sort of spinning the dust around
7046.76,7054.76," And so you get like an interesting shape, you know, and it was this weird way to try to incorporate real physics and so making a planet"
7054.76,7063.76, And obviously it didn't make it into the final game and so they put this out there is just showing what one of the many things that they were considering doing in the game
7063.76,7068.76, Because it seems to me like that at some point they thought about simulating practically everything in the whole fucking universe
7068.76,7073.76, That's how they pitched it. Yeah three years ago or whatever. Sim everything
7073.76,7075.76, Right they definitely had to cut back up
7075.76,7078.76, It's damn vicious
7078.76,7079.76," Yeah, just a little bit"
7079.76,7082.76, But it's pretty interesting stuff
7082.76,7088.76, And I get to be willing they'll probably put several more up before the game comes up. They probably will. Yeah
7088.76,7092.76, Sean Maloy and I saw a bunch of that when we went to see Sims 3
7092.76,7099.76, So I don't know if this is just something that this particular team or group of developers does but it was really interesting to see where
7099.76,7116.76, Where Rod Homball they had at the Sims department who was on our podcast a little while ago had the whole Sims 3 team everybody on the team to prototype's based on a certain human interaction that they felt they wanted to pursue in Sims 3 which was socialization
7116.76,7125.76, So they had everybody just do whatever it could be anything and they all came up with different little kind of mini games or whatever that would that was sort of their idea of what what
7125.76,7134.76, Socialization was about so it was pretty neat and we got to play some of them. So it's sort of a cool insight just to see what what's going on in these guys heads
7134.76,7140.76," Yeah, and I think it's interesting that like most of the time when you get to see a game that's being like that's in the works"
7140.76,7148.76," You usually see something that represents what you'll be playing. Yeah, it's pretty cool for them to release something for you to play around with that is so early"
7148.76,7159.76," That's almost unrecognizably part of sport, you know, it's really an early early part of their creative process and and sort of audacious to catalog it"
7159.76,7167.76, It's like we're going to provide you with the history of sport. I mean it adds to this since like that sports is mega event and we we've even got it documented
7168.76,7175.76," Well, I hope they beat the declining hype because I definitely get the feeling that that game is on the downside of its hype curve"
7175.76,7187.76," I don't know anything that but let's let's know I just I you know, I think that coming out of E3 I there's I feel like there's a real sense that the game isn't going to deliver on the promises that it delivered you know"
7187.76,7196.76," Made three weeks ago or six months ago or three years ago and you know, I want to be completely blown away, but you know, maybe maybe what they're doing is lowering my expectations"
7196.76,7202.76, So that when it comes out we already had the backlash and that was the backlash of the backlash. I think we are back
7202.76,7203.76, We're back
7203.76,7208.76," What's the current part of the hype meter. Yeah, what am I supposed to think"
7208.76,7216.76," Sean, you're more of a believer now, so you were going to say yeah, I think that it's I mean we face something similar like right before GTA 4 came out"
7216.76,7223.76, Where there was like I remember Robert and I were specifically having this conversation or like does anyone care and you're like you know what it doesn't matter because I guarantee you the week
7223.76,7230.76," We'll come when the games can be released and we're going to run to the store. Yeah, but I think in this case it's like yeah, you're right"
7230.76,7235.76, If it's like diminishing the hype that was established three years ago was big but the hype from six months ago
7235.76,7241.76, I think that they're they're pretty much six months ago presenting an accurate like representation of how the games actually going to be but even like
7242.76,7248.76, On this it's not even anecdotal evidence. It's it's armature traffic evidence and like based on you know
7248.76,7254.76, We put up a story that will say here these creatures created in this orange and stuff and sadly
7254.76,7257.76," You know, I'm always talking about the great features video. It's like it's got like"
7257.76,7262.76, You know 50 times the traffic of anything and it continues week after week to be popular
7262.76,7266.76, And it's like maybe it's because it's just a kind of story that's it's very easy to click through
7266.76,7270.76, You know to invest anything other than the ability to hit your scroll wheel and look at like cute pictures
7270.76,7274.76, But it's a quiet actual reading
7274.76,7278.76," Yeah, but I think those it like that that interest is there when it comes out"
7278.76,7283.76, Everyone will be talking about it and I mean putting the creature creator out just costs like another big you know
7283.76,7289.76, About of discussion that's actually what re-up the hype from you was actually seeing what people were making was like
7289.76,7291.76," Okay, the creativity really is like"
7291.76,7296.76, I'm afraid to put it in my my it's real daughter is addicted to the creature creator
7296.76,7305.76, She's got a library of a hundred crazy s things. I never could have come up with but I still feel like we haven't seen the game all the way through
7305.76,7308.76," Right, I mean we have not seen lots of little pieces that look really cool"
7308.76,7315.76," Yeah, I know how you when you sit down and you want to play for 30 hours over the course of a long game"
7315.76,7318.76, I don't know what the hell that even looks like right you know
7318.76,7327.76, I know all the pieces look really freaking cool. I've seen I can imagine it just because I played in like bits and pieces in you know some of the different like stages
7327.76,7329.76, There's the five stages of the game
7329.76,7337.76, And I don't imagine anyone would play for five hours can consecutively with the game unless they like spend a lot of that time messing with the creature editor and things like that
7337.76,7339.76, But I think like
7339.76,7346.76, I don't know maybe it's going to go through this period where it's going to come out everyone's going to talk about like oh my god like heavy got it like everyone's going to want to just like
7346.76,7348.76, There's this phase of the post release
7348.76,7355.76," Right, where everyone's going to like I'm part of this I have something to say about it. I played it to and it's going to be celebrating the diversity of possible creations"
7355.76,7361.76, And I think next is going to be this phase of like just like you a GTA when GTA 4 came out is like here's my GTA story
7361.76,7368.76, It's like tell you like what's that who's got the campaign right now? It's like tell us your story and it's like it's basically advertising something but you like
7368.76,7374.76, I don't know maybe someone will recognize that but it's some some current ad game name for some non game really product
7374.76,7378.76, I don't like it adds this is what happened. I didn't watch PBS
7378.76,7381.76, So what I play in my mode. I don't look at ads
7381.76,7383.76, So put I really listen to classical music
7384.76,7391.76," In that phase I imagine people will be saying things like oh my god, I ran into the creature that I created in like the tribal stage"
7391.76,7399.76," I'm like another planet this whole other system, but I also remember the time when this just ship just came down and abducted me and it all made sense"
7399.76,7403.76, Because then I recognize that same ship on that planet and they kept the details and everyone will have all these stories
7403.76,7412.76, Then a couple months after that people will start saying hey wasn't this the one where that fucking dude in the glasses was telling me I'd be able to like make planets and all this stuff
7412.76,7417.76, You know like I could you know change the this the linity of water and all these other you know
7417.76,7420.76, All these other variables and stuff and then they'll start to feel like
7420.76,7428.76," Well, it's fun creature creator, but where's all these other promises right like the and then that'll I think that's just a natural cycle of the way that games come out"
7428.76,7432.76," Yeah, although for sports particularly hard"
7432.76,7438.76, Sort of attack back to game because for years they talked about it like they were doing like serious
7438.76,7441.76, Research into the nature of the universe or something
7441.76,7452.76," No, I don't think they were sure they did no right Ted come Ted presentations absolutely he's talking about creating tools to learn about how things are made"
7452.76,7455.76, I mean he totally hyped it up
7455.76,7461.26," Years ago, but I don't think he said that's what's the high-muscle that's like what they were doing on their end while I were making the game"
7461.26,7466.76, I definitely don't I definitely don't see this hype. I think they honestly have this weird creative process
7466.76,7474.46, Where they look at the natural world and they're really interested in science and the way the universe works and say
7474.46,7480.76, What can we take from this and and turn into a video game and the first thing they think is like all let's do everything
7480.76,7485.26," Right, and then you need a motto do that to like to some extent like I've been at stories about him"
7485.26,7491.06," Getting ideas from like gardening. Yeah, although like in the in the story there slightly different outcome"
7493.26,7499.18, In the story I just wrote I pointed out I pointed out what a big difference that it is actually between like the way me
7499.18,7506.26, Emotors this thing is in the way that like will write those things because you look at me emoto and like he will famously create a game where it's all about like
7506.26,7509.26, You know like when Mario 64 was in development
7509.26,7519.76, He had his designers build this little garden where he played around with Mario's moves and and design moves and just played with the way he moved before he designed anything else
7519.76,7527.06, It was all about the tactile experience of playing Mario so as you know creating a world out of play
7527.06,7533.46, Whereas with sport you've got this thing where they look at the world and try to create play from the real world
7533.46,7535.46," Right, but"
7536.06,7541.26," Anyway, right, that's the most about oh, yeah, you know what's the other it's almost unfortunate is that now"
7542.58,7550.34, Since will and and Max has talked it's such a length about their game imagine if it had been reversed where the game comes out and and you're playing it for the first time
7550.34,7556.18, And you're realizing for yourself as you're playing that the game is sort of mimicking the history of video game development
7556.18,7560.9, You know where it starts off with something on the level of Pac Man and it moves up and we've heard this over and over again and
7561.42,7567.46, Introduces you know the equivalent of like save games and all these other things and basically working its way up to you know
7567.46,7571.7, The same everything I mean it's like if we took it home and we played and we experienced that for ourselves
7571.7,7575.099999999999, I think that would be really like fascinating and really that would be like a
7575.099999999999,7579.7," Chattering yeah, but it's really came out of nowhere. It's like no we've we've heard it so many times"
7579.7,7586.82, And this is potentially one of the coolest structural you know aspects of the game and it's just like it's been like three years now that people have been right
7586.82,7595.12, Not that I'm in the game right well somebody asked me on a on a on a forum on our forum and a question thread about like did I feel like
7595.74,7598.74, Personally that that this the cycle of of
7599.34,7606.58, publicity the way these things work over multi years of that ultimately you know is it ends up being a detriment or hurting the company in the game and
7606.58,7613.48, Question and I think it probably usually does right this Mike multi year build up of hype and the going dark and coming back
7614.0,7620.28," You know, yeah, I mean imagine you're right what if what if all we knew about sport was that there was this creature creator and then"
7620.28,7624.2, Maybe the next stage and then when it came out of turned out it did all the you know
7624.2,7626.599999999999, It kept going going it going but we've blown away
7626.599999999999,7631.04, We've seen how that feels in a small scale. I mean that's how we all felt about portal right yeah
7631.04,7636.299999999999, That's right and then boom it was like here's this awesome thing that you've never even heard of
7636.299999999999,7639.4, I was all games were like that right I mean
7639.4,7641.679999999999, I was like the first time I'd heard about the obla three
7642.200000000001,7647.9800000000005," Was because it watched this week right I mean that would be great. Yeah, yeah, wouldn't that did we'd all just be talking about it for a month"
7647.9800000000005,7653.280000000001, Right just don't know if that's practical though because I think that people do use like the feedback from the public
7653.400000000001,7657.92, The change aspects of a game after making it but really I mean your right
7659.200000000001,7661.92, But portal is like that's just a great example
7661.92,7667.08, I mean and look what it did like we ended up giving it game of the year ourselves and you have w and that and that's a game
7667.08,7671.04," Though that would have been absolutely ruined by knowing anything about it. Yes, you know"
7671.04,7676.58, Like I think some games can stand up somewhat like it is a shame that they let the cat out of the bag and
7676.58,7678.58, Sport about this sort of cool idea of
7679.6,7685.56, Tracing the history of games like that would have been something neat to just experience but for the most part like learning about
7685.56,7689.76, You know the basic mechanics of the game doesn't tend to take away from it in my opinion
7689.76,7694.78, And I think more some other Easter eggs about sport that aren't completely out yet. There's got it all now. I'm sure
7694.78,7698.24," Yeah, I'm sure there will be yeah, they're toward the ending of the game. We know there's some right"
7699.2,7705.219999999999, Like in in the past I think this I mean well for one more more companies are basically taking an exact course that we're talking about
7706.08,7710.5599999999995, This kind of one that like Activision really proved worked well with call to do for last year
7710.76,7715.04, But beyond that I think that the fact that this is happening in the internet age even intensifies
7715.5199999999995,7717.5199999999995, Sort of burnout cycle because
7717.92,7722.28, I mean a few different reasons you can you can be held to every single word you had
7722.28,7725.48, So say if you like you know your dentist die or something people are already doing that to him
7725.48,7731.08, You know you make a claim about your game it could be years ago or whatever people dig that up with like two keystrokes and like there it is all the
7731.08,7736.12, Right word for word there is your face in a video saying these things people can bring up the YouTube
7736.12,7738.679999999999, So we'll write and stuff and then immediately put those out and it's like
7739.08,7744.5, Maybe that's like someone's first encounter maybe like this month someone's being introduced to sport by seeing that very first
7744.66,7750.919999999999," You know GDC video with wheel riders and things and so that I think just complicates it, you know and and makes people more aware of"
7751.44,7754.04, You know what what they've been told and what they're receiving
7754.76,7759.92," Yeah, I blame Derek smart it's all his balls everything started all started with Derek"
7759.92,7766.96," No, the whole the endless hype cycle. Yeah, I mean he's he's the cautionary tale of telling anybody about your game was was"
7767.72,7770.36, Or making one was his before's like it's on a
7771.8,7777.56," Yeah, yeah, yeah, he goes back to use net he's yeah, he's the original use net flame more"
7778.64,7780.64, Starter that'll cruiser. Yeah
7780.64,7782.64, Oh
7782.64,7786.240000000001," Just got a shiver down my spine. Yeah, I was her those were good all days"
7786.96,7792.400000000001," Are we at the end of our show skip you think we've had it's a little bit on stick a home. Yeah, let's see that here"
7792.96,7796.56, Don't blame it on don't start that shit. We're done cuz we're done cuz we're tired
7796.56,7799.96," Just no kick out skip as cool enough to hang around for us. Thank you, skip"
7802.280000000001,7804.280000000001, That's it Ryan any final words
7805.72,7807.72, None
