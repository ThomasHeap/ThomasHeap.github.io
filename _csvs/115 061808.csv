304.0,308.8, I borrowed one from work but you bought the game anyway. Yes. Okay. That's what I did really
309.76,318.4," Wait, that's that you do a Lepia 3. No, he's all this old is there poor one. Yeah, all right. Yeah, so I didn't feel bad about that"
318.4,324.4," I don't know. I think I've done the past for other things. I'm sure you've had a collector edition. Actually, I think I've done that."
324.4,328.4," I did. Yeah, that's cool. Why do you get by the collector's edition?"
328.4,332.4," There's a bonus blue ray, but I don't know what's on it because there's a spoiler warning."
333.03999999999996,336.79999999999995," Wait, wait, wait. You bought the version that comes with more movies."

342.0,345.2," Man, what have you put it in? It's just like a five hour long codec."
346.71999999999997,352.32, I'll watch it. That's cool. So what else is in the box? Get like at the code ring or
352.32,356.88, no t-shirt. Anything that box? The box is cool. What else?
357.36,363.12, Just a blue ray. You get a bonus disc with I don't know what's on it because it says don't watch until you finish the game
363.12,367.2," and get it. So that's it. That's two discs. Yeah, there's our manuals."
367.2,373.04," I mean, there's the normal game and there's a bonus disc. It's just a special box that looks good next to your"
373.04,379.52," various anime collections. You know, like it holds up next to those hundred dollar DVD box sets of"
380.32,382.56, like anime. Friends look in girls and
387.84,394.48, So that's what we won't be talking about now. Okay. Later. Later after Ryan leaves a replaying this game.
394.48,398.8," All right. And yeah, all of you listening who don't want spoilers leave one Ryan leaves."
399.36,405.44," Yeah. Okay. You know, you should just be doing that anyway. Oh, yeah. There you go."
406.64,410.64, Sean's not even at the door and this dude's already stepping up to talk shit.
410.64,415.52," Yeah, he's taking the show with you. Yeah, that's normal. I just got it. One of these days, Ryan,"
415.52,420.64, you need to bring your rant back because I've told other people that you will rant and rant
420.64,425.76," when you're not on the podcast and they're amazing. I do. And you have now in there, show your"
425.76,430.24," brands. It's true. Well, I have to have all find something to go off about. Maybe I try to finish"
430.24,435.35999999999996, Melge your solid four. Okay. That's true. We know the secret of Ryan that people who only know him
435.35999999999996,440.79999999999995," from the quiet podcast don't know. You have a good D&D rant on the last legendary thing. Oh, I did. Yeah."
441.52000000000004,445.84000000000003, Were you not on it? No. I was out. Yeah. I heard you were going to be skipped.
450.24,454.88, I still haven't seen fourth edition. We are going to play a game and record it. We have we always have
454.88,459.28000000000003," these plans and that never happened around here. Big plans. Yes, sure."
460.72,470.56," Wait, what is fourth edition in my missing. The only the only time I've ever played Dungeons and"
470.56,475.44," Dragons. The people I was playing with killed me in like 10 minutes. That's a mean. Yeah, that is"
475.44,481.04," mean. Yeah, that was the only time I was something you did. I think provoked them. No, I just think I"
481.04,488.08," wasn't cool enough to be part of the T.D. You know, that's that's the sad truth of my life. That I was"
488.08,495.2," too nerdy for D&D. Wow. So, I was too busy like worshiping MC Hammer and wearing like"
495.2,501.28," balloon pants and shaving, shaving lines into the side of my head. Can you ever do that? Yeah, yeah,"
501.28,507.12, I actually did. I had a friend of mine put a piece sign into the back of my head and I had like sort of
507.12,514.0, an open l.e. I shaped the red hot chili pepper symbol into a friend's head. I didn't want him. I had
514.0,519.52," wise that he'd not do it. But I was like, I can still do it, man. I can shave the straight line. I'll do it for you."
519.52,524.72," Yeah, I did a lot of crazy stuff. I like growing up in a little small town called Grand Prix"
524.72,529.0400000000001, Texas. I was always under the impression that being cool meant being like the people on TV.
529.0400000000001,534.5600000000001," But that was not exactly the community standard of cool. So, a few, you know, mimic MTV and show up"
535.28,541.84, to your to your middle school and Grand Prix Texas totally crossed out. Not not cool. That hurts overall.
541.84,548.08," So, you actually did that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Nice. What was cool? I would have"
548.08,553.44, pictured you more for like like the punky color green hair dye from like hot topic that fades to like
554.4000000000001,559.6800000000001, Ash. That was high school for two watches. That was that was high school. Yeah. Did you do that?
559.6800000000001,565.6800000000001," I had well, I had pink. Really? But I didn't wash my hair so it didn't fade and stay true. And I"
565.6800000000001,573.6," had a blue period. Really? Blue, hair. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Does it punky color? No, something else."
574.1600000000001,578.8000000000001," I meant like a nude like my own period, you know. Okay. Did it come with a little above?"
578.9599999999999,586.8," Did it come with site with the instant clown posse period? No, is that for actually posted my insane? You were into the insane"
586.8,595.4399999999999," novel. I thought my shit was embarrassing. No, because you've let's talk about now that we're going here."
595.4399999999999,603.04, You want to talk about your history as an amateur wrestler? You're really good. Do the slay ride
603.04,607.5999999999999, men. You address up a Santa Claus and you had a move called the slay ride. But SLA Y.
609.76,614.7199999999999," Yeah, I had friends who were really into pro wrestling including Michael Dannaho. If any of you guys"
614.7199999999999,621.3599999999999," know, Michael Danna, we're from the same town and and the him and all of our friends were really into wrestling"
621.3599999999999,626.16," and they had a backyard wrestling thing. And we would like show up to the park and you know,"
626.16,632.16, all of we would have like a couple of our you know bands play and and and people would wrestle and hurt each
632.16,636.88, other until the cops showed up and told us to go home after being like baffled that we weren't drinking.
639.28,646.4," But yeah, I would dress up as Santa and my character was Satanic Santa and uh and my killer my killer"
646.4,651.1999999999999," move was the slay ride, but it was really bad because I was just sitting on people and one time I sat"
652.4,659.1999999999999," and I was a pretty big guy. I mean, I'm a big guy now, but I was like obese and uh and I sat like on my"
659.1999999999999,664.8," on my best not like fat man stuff though, right? No, no, I mean fat man here again like that"
664.8,670.8," and so you know, I was I mean, I was just pretty big, you know, I was I was on the McDonald's diet,"
670.8,678.0799999999999, I was I worked at a 7-Eleven and I drink slurpees all day and then I ate at the McDonald's across the street.
678.0799999999999,682.88," Could you please, this is before I became a pansy vegetarian, you use your tip as a gravy bib."
682.88,685.76," Oh man, first like a wet napper, so."
686.8,688.88, The was it to become the white crash podcast?
688.88,692.88, when all the white trash started showing up.
692.88,695.88, Oh god.
695.88,697.88, Yeah.
697.88,703.6," Oh, but I felt bad because at one time I said on my best friend Jacob and he really got hurt and"
703.6,704.88, like knock him out of the house.
704.88,706.88, But he tried to come after me.
706.88,710.88," You know, and he's pretty, he's got no reach with his arms."
710.88,715.88, And so he kept on trying to punch me and I was just pushing him back and back and back until he tripped and
715.88,716.88, like hit his head.
716.88,720.88," And it was, it was a disaster and he hated me for a couple days."
720.88,721.88, As whole.
721.88,723.88, He was he the first recipient of the slay right?
723.88,724.88, No.
724.88,727.88," No, the other guys were like kind of into wrestling and into getting hurt."
727.88,729.88," First passenger, rather."
729.88,732.88, If we asked Donna how what a slay ride is.
732.88,733.88, He knows.
733.88,734.88, He knows.
734.88,735.88, Wow.
735.88,736.88, I did another was this connection between you two guys.
736.88,740.88," Yeah, we, I was actually present the first time he ever got drunk."
740.88,742.88, He was he was 16 years old.
742.88,744.88, It was in a ravine behind a golf course.
744.88,746.88," And it was, it was a 40."
746.88,748.88, We were all a little bit nervous.
748.88,752.88," No, there was a little bit of water trickling through."
752.88,754.88, It was like way out in the burbs.
754.88,757.88, But we were significantly older than he was.
757.88,759.88, I don't remember who befriended him.
759.88,761.88, But we would come over.
761.88,763.88, That sounds bad.
763.88,766.88," No, but I don't remember who his like original connection was."
766.88,772.88, But he totally fit into the crew because he was like totally into the games and the rest like.
772.88,776.88, So did he take a few punches to the head over the ears and yet in the.
776.88,778.88, I don't remember.
778.88,782.88, I don't remember Donna had like wrestling a lot at the time.
782.88,783.88, I'm just asking.
783.88,785.88, I don't think so.
785.88,787.88, He did he did play a lot.
787.88,788.88, Was it lying in our VG?
788.88,789.88, Those those were beans.
789.88,790.88, It was funny.
790.88,792.88, Like there's some of you guys were like puzzle right.
792.88,794.88, You wanted to know more about this locale.
794.88,799.88," I mean, that just immediately clicked because that's where everything happens."
799.88,804.88," Like in your like a 40 of like of course, it's not that the bottle of triple-sector that's on fish"
804.88,805.88, to other deaths.
805.88,806.88, We don't or mad dog.
806.88,808.88," No, it was like the mixer or something."
808.88,809.88, We call those dirt parties.
809.88,810.88, I think kids.
810.88,816.88," I do in the ravine got a bunch of morning glories, which it's a flower."
816.88,819.88," But if you make a tea out of them, it's just an insane,"
819.88,822.88, insanely powerful drug and lethal.
822.88,825.88, And they got off from some friend is like pre-enernet days.
825.88,828.88, They somehow got the recipe to make the tea.
828.88,830.88, The morning glory.
830.88,832.88, And they got like the proportions way wrong.
832.88,834.88, So they like a massive overdose.
834.88,837.88," And when they took it, they all like shit their pants like right out there."
837.88,839.88," And they were like, but then like other interesting stuff came out."
839.88,843.88," We're like, they went back and they all listened to the cures out and distortion."
843.88,845.88," I mean, not distortion, disintegration."
845.88,848.88," And so everyone's sitting and listening through the one side of the album,"
848.88,851.88, singing along and doing aerodrons there and the band stuff too.
851.88,853.88," And then you know, come as time to turn the tape over."
853.88,854.88, And they go to do it.
854.88,856.88, And there's like no tape in the thing.
856.88,861.88, They're all on on mark though.
861.88,863.88, That makes it sound like a lot of fun.
863.88,864.88," Yeah, that's quite cool."
864.88,867.88," I mean, except for the shit in your pants thing."
867.88,869.88, Thanks for a call.
869.88,871.88, It'd be a really good segue in the Metal Gear Solid Square.
871.88,876.88," But actually, I think he basically lost like John lost two months of his life"
876.88,879.88, because he has no accounting for him after.
879.88,882.88, From like the day after they did that for the next couple of months.
882.88,884.88, He has no memories whatsoever.
884.88,886.88, Can anyone account for them for him?
886.88,887.88," No, no."
887.88,889.88," I think his ex girlfriend can, but that's about it."
889.88,890.88, Wow.
890.88,891.88, The imaginary cure can.
891.88,895.88," So, while we're getting personal now, I want to start a new segment."
895.88,897.88," You know, Anthony's nickname is Chuff."
897.88,899.88," He's also known as Nergal, but I want to start a segment known as Chuff."
899.88,901.88," Wait, wait, how does he get Chuff?"
901.88,902.88, Chuff?
902.88,903.88, It's his dwarf name.
903.88,904.88, Yeah.
904.88,905.88, Okay.
905.88,906.88, It's like my name and all that.
906.88,908.88, Rope like so itself appointed.
908.88,909.88, You picked it.
909.88,910.88, Yeah.
910.88,911.88, So Nergal is not so.
911.88,912.88, You're not so.
912.88,913.88, I just find Chuff.
913.88,914.88, Okay.
914.88,915.88, Chuff.
915.88,916.88, So Chuff love.
916.88,921.88, Do you want me to narrate or would you rather take control of your own story?
921.88,922.88, You can narrate for a bit.
922.88,923.88, Okay.
923.88,926.88," So, we'll take a look at the end of the script."
926.88,928.88, We were shopping in downtown Berg.
928.88,929.88," Oh, never mind."
929.88,930.88," Well, it's."
930.88,931.88, Sorry.
931.88,932.88, I.
932.88,935.88, You didn't want to reveal where this was.
935.88,936.88, Okay.
936.88,937.88," Well, Anthony, I was shopping."
937.88,938.88, We live in Missouri.
938.88,939.88, You know.
939.88,940.88, So we were.
940.88,941.88, We're shopping against.
941.88,942.88, We're not going to get a camera.
942.88,948.88," And, um, you know, we just got got back from a comic store and Anthony had a bag."
948.88,949.88," You know, his hand."
949.88,951.88, It had a walking dead issue when it.
951.88,956.88, And so this really nice and and cute clerk in the game store comes up to Anthony and
956.88,960.88," just comments on the, you know, and walking dead says that she's a fan."
960.88,962.88, And Anthony didn't really have much to say at the time.
962.88,966.88, And so we just kind of free finished our shopping and then we left.
966.88,969.88, And then we started to hear about it later in the week.
970.88,971.88," Oh, my god, what did I do?"
971.88,973.88, Like I fucked up guys.
973.88,974.88, I fucked up.
974.88,977.88," Not not really saying that, but I mean, and we were like."
977.88,978.88, It's all good.
978.88,979.88, You can go back.
979.88,982.88," So Anthony, you are pretty interested in forming a,"
982.88,984.88, a plan to interact with the events.
984.88,986.88," I was debating going back every day, telling our"
986.88,988.88, hiding that I might come in late.
988.88,990.88, So I could go take care of it.
990.88,992.88, But I didn't know when she worked.
992.88,994.88," And I figured I, I've only ever seen her on the weekend."
994.88,995.88, So I had.
995.88,998.88, We were trying to psych you up to like I even offered because I was warning you.
998.88,1001.88," Well, first I was almost psyched me out because I was like, they're going to be two guys"
1001.88,1005.88, and they're working with her and you got the stones to go right up to the counter with her flank
1005.88,1009.88, on either side and just like late down or do you want me to go and run in her parents
1009.88,1012.88, and act like my guitar hero controllers broken.
1012.88,1017.88," You know, help me get your loan."
1017.88,1021.88, And then we started coming up with like all these like pick up lines for Anthony to use.
1021.88,1025.88," Actually, it was more in the form of telling them what not to do."
1025.88,1027.88," So those included like, hey, body by."
1027.88,1037.88," Hey, body by we fit or asking for her animal crossing friend code and then asking if I could trade in my number for her."
1037.88,1039.88," Yeah, the edge."
1039.88,1041.88, Can I get the edge card to your heart?
1041.88,1043.88," I mean, you have to give them like $30."
1043.88,1045.88," Yeah, with with your number."
1045.88,1048.88, The best joke to turn on and sell it for 35.
1048.88,1054.88," The best joke, though, is I've referred to for my wife dot WMB before and that's like a video"
1054.88,1067.88," legendary, unpublished video of YouTube user demonious acts, master baiting for X, Y at the camera and then waving with this greasy hands after there's more details."
1067.88,1068.88, I'll spare you.
1068.88,1073.88, But so we just began a new legend that's for my store credit dot WMB.
1073.88,1080.88," But okay, but the amazing thing to be about this shot just went out the window here."
1080.88,1082.88, The amazing thing to be about this.
1083.88,1088.88, As a fine boy and Sean is the disgusting purriffy saying all this.
1088.88,1092.88," Yeah, Anthony didn't, but this is this was the usual."
1092.88,1097.88," This was the usual on the online talking and we're all sort of, but we're really just joking."
1097.88,1099.88, We're we're we're excited.
1099.88,1101.88, We're pulling where you Anthony.
1101.88,1102.88, What happened?
1102.88,1103.88, Yeah.
1103.88,1111.88," Yeah, I went back on that Saturday and like walked in there and I didn't see her and I was like hoping to God that she wasn't working so that I wouldn't have to actually."
1111.88,1113.88, I wouldn't have to actually do it.
1113.88,1116.88, Because I was so scared.
1116.88,1119.88, It's intimidating.
1119.88,1120.88," No, it is."
1120.88,1121.88, It's how do you do it.
1121.88,1124.88, Not only because it's like the placement.
1124.88,1127.88," But, but you know, she's she's kind of intimidating."
1127.88,1128.88, Looking a little bit.
1128.88,1130.88," Yeah, so in a good way."
1130.88,1131.88, In a good way.
1131.88,1132.88, Not a bad way.
1132.88,1133.88," Yeah, well, not a good one."
1133.88,1136.88," When they're attractive, it's like it makes it more intimidating."
1136.88,1140.88," And she is, which I wanted to say like when when I showed up today, I heard you guys talking about."
1140.88,1143.88, And all you guys said was like girl at a game store.
1143.88,1147.88, And I knew immediately what girl you were talking about because this is the town that I live in.
1147.88,1149.88," And I was like, oh, I'm not going to say the place."
1149.88,1153.88, But I knew immediately what girl you were talking about because she's like notoriously.
1153.88,1156.88, This is not the kind of girl you've seen a typical game store.
1156.88,1159.88," You're like, I got to keep walking there with your stupid nerdy video game."
1159.88,1162.88," You're like, oh, maybe I should go to another place."
1162.88,1163.88, Yeah.
1163.88,1168.88, I rolled in there and she was working with like two co-workers and it was super busy.
1168.88,1171.88, That's predicted as predicted. Yeah.
1171.88,1175.88, And so I started like a perusing the store.
1175.88,1180.88, But how only after using like coping that she'd come over and ask me if I wanted to help with something.
1180.88,1185.88, And then I like have that break away from like the two people behind the fucking void of the counter.
1185.88,1186.88, Yeah.
1186.88,1188.88, And that didn't happen.
1188.88,1191.88, So 20 minutes later.
1191.88,1192.88, That's a lot of browsing.
1192.88,1194.88, 20 minutes later.
1194.88,1195.88, 20 minutes.
1195.88,1197.88, I don't want to talk about what kind of a game has a lot of time.
1197.88,1199.88, It's a lot of time games.
1199.88,1200.88, All right.
1200.88,1202.88, He had to read the back of the box of.
1202.88,1207.88," So then like, you know, as she was taking out all the garbage is not it's like,"
1207.88,1209.88, I should actually leave the store.
1209.88,1211.88, That's going to be like my only chance.
1211.88,1221.88, This is what Beget met in James's alternate reality version where you ambush during you spunk out of a trash cave with a handful of roses.
1221.88,1222.88, Fucking cooking.
1222.88,1223.88, Not cookie monster.
1223.88,1225.88, I was in the case of it all.
1225.88,1226.88, I waited.
1226.88,1227.88, I waited.
1227.88,1228.88, I waited.
1228.88,1229.88, I waited.
1229.88,1230.88, I waited.
1230.88,1231.88, I waited.
1231.88,1234.88, I waited for her to take the garbage and come back.
1234.88,1237.88," And then when she was coming back, I just I walked up."
1237.88,1241.88, And was she taking out the garbage because the store was closing?
1241.88,1242.88, No.
1242.88,1243.88," Oh, the garbage time."
1243.88,1244.88, Picture.
1244.88,1245.88," It's like, can it night?"
1245.88,1246.88, No.
1246.88,1247.88, Yeah.
1247.88,1249.88, You could have used like tell you famous line from the movie kids.
1249.88,1250.88, Like I barely know you.
1250.88,1251.88, But I feel like I love you.
1251.88,1254.88, I don't know why you poured dogs or not show or something.
1254.88,1255.88, It works.
1255.88,1256.88, It works.
1256.88,1257.88, No.
1257.88,1258.88, I went.
1258.88,1262.88," At this point, she has to realize that you have been in the store for almost a half hour and hour."
1262.88,1267.88," I went with something equally lame, which was like, I came down here for two reasons."
1267.88,1270.88," And I wanted to get metal gear for, which I had."
1270.88,1272.88, And that's what I said.
1272.88,1274.88, That was to give you a slide.
1274.88,1275.88, That was for second.
1275.88,1276.88, Yeah.
1276.88,1277.88, And the other one.
1277.88,1279.88, I was to make up for the previous week and where I fucked up.
1279.88,1280.88, So.
1280.88,1281.88, Right on.
1281.88,1282.88, Nice.
1282.88,1283.88, Pretty.
1283.88,1284.88, You did it.
1284.88,1285.88, You.
1285.88,1286.88, That's pretty manly there.
1286.88,1288.88, But then she was.
1288.88,1289.88, Did she.
1289.88,1290.88, Yeah.
1290.88,1291.88, She said no.
1291.88,1292.88, She shut you down.
1292.88,1293.88, No.
1293.88,1294.88, She didn't.
1294.88,1295.88, But.
1295.88,1297.88," I mean, I haven't hung out with anything yet."
1297.88,1298.88, But then you saw her like talk about the comic someone else had at the counter.
1298.88,1299.88," Oh, we've got the new Thor."
1299.88,1300.88, I like Thor.
1300.88,1301.88, Yeah.
1301.88,1302.88, That's art thing.
1302.88,1303.88, That's what we do.
1303.88,1304.88, It's awesome.
1304.88,1306.88, I can't excumb to get me to trade in games.
1306.88,1308.88, You're in a dangerous phase now.
1308.88,1309.88, I don't want to get you nervous.
1309.88,1310.88, I've got.
1310.88,1311.88, I've got it.
1311.88,1312.88, I've got it.
1312.88,1313.88, I've got it.
1313.88,1315.88, I've got it.
1315.88,1318.88, I've got it.
1318.88,1320.88, It's all good and you pulled through.
1320.88,1321.88, You're now.
1321.88,1323.88, You're now the king.
1323.88,1324.88, But.
1324.88,1325.88, As I understand.
1325.88,1327.88, You're going to be playing games together.
1327.88,1329.88, And I just don't.
1329.88,1330.88, My next bit advice.
1330.88,1332.88, Avoid situations where you're.
1332.88,1336.88, Take in terms of playing and watching each other play.
1336.88,1338.88, And let's hope neither one of you.
1338.88,1340.5200000000002, She'll just know like I just talked.
1340.5200000000002,1342.6000000000001, I was talking about you to all my coworkers.
1342.6000000000001,1344.3600000000001," Oh, yeah."
1344.3600000000001,1345.3600000000001, Yeah.
1345.3600000000001,1346.8000000000002, Did she know your last name?
1346.8000000000002,1347.8000000000002, No.
1347.8000000000002,1351.1200000000001," If she is listening, Anthony is a fine boy."
1351.1200000000001,1354.0400000000002, I approve of this relationship entirely.
1354.0400000000002,1355.5600000000002, I don't see her now.
1355.5600000000002,1357.0, You do have my blessing.
1357.0,1358.96," But I think you and if it doesn't work out,"
1358.96,1361.1200000000001, if she likes older Mary Jewish guys.
1361.1200000000001,1365.3600000000001," Oh, oh, oh, oh."
1365.3600000000001,1367.16, I think it's amazing though that you actually
1367.16,1370.5600000000002," did this in the physical meat space because I'm like,"
1370.5600000000002,1372.0," I'm like, let's flip it."
1372.0,1373.0, They'll read meat space.
1373.0,1373.72, Break that down a minute.
1373.72,1374.6000000000001, What is a meat space?
1374.6000000000001,1376.92," You know, it's not my, let me know about the fourth edition"
1376.92,1377.48, of the meat space.
1377.48,1378.64, OK.
1378.64,1380.96," No, but honestly, like how many people you're age?"
1380.96,1381.8000000000002, How old are you?
1381.8000000000002,1382.96," 25, 25."
1382.96,1383.92, How many people you're age?
1383.92,1385.88, Are asking girls out in person.
1385.88,1388.5600000000002," I know they're all like lurking on my space,"
1388.5600000000002,1391.6000000000001," poking girls in Facebook, doing all this passive"
1391.6000000000001,1393.6000000000001," aggressive, fucking pussy shit."
1393.6000000000001,1396.3600000000001, And you went up to a girl at her place in employment.
1396.36,1398.6, And you talked to her and you asked her out.
1398.6,1400.0, Like a real man.
1400.0,1402.4399999999998," A seriously amazing skill that like,"
1402.4399999999998,1405.28, not a person of people do not have hair hair hair hair hair.
1405.28,1407.3999999999999, Let's go to the part that we're after.
1407.3999999999999,1409.4399999999998, Our door after I asked her out.
1409.4399999999998,1409.76, Yeah.
1409.76,1411.8799999999999, And she wanted to talk and I had only mentally prepared
1411.8799999999999,1413.3999999999999, myself to ask the question.
1413.3999999999999,1415.32," Oh, so then I was like, uh,"
1415.32,1417.36," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1417.36,1419.76," No, I mean, it was fine."
1419.76,1422.8, I just wasn't totally ready for her to continue to sit there
1422.8,1423.32, and want to talk.
1423.32,1424.4399999999998, Got to do flashcards.
1424.44,1427.16," Yeah, the problem was you immediately slipped into a long"
1427.16,1429.92, explanation of the story line of the Metal Gear
1429.92,1432.04, Solid series.
1432.04,1433.76, It took like 45 minutes.
1433.76,1435.72, And he basically looked like a psychopath.
1435.72,1438.24," Actually, she talks to me about Metal Gear 4 and how she was"
1438.24,1442.8, going to dress up as a as one of the characters for the midnight
1442.8,1443.8, release.
1443.8,1444.8400000000001, Really?
1444.8400000000001,1446.3600000000001, Which character do you like?
1446.3600000000001,1447.8400000000001," No, like what you're doing?"
1447.8400000000001,1449.88, The video one that leads all the the rebels.
1449.88,1451.0800000000002," Right, right, Merrill."
1451.0800000000002,1452.0800000000002, No.
1452.0800000000002,1452.8," So, Merrill."
1452.8,1453.68," So, I'm joking."
1454.64,1457.28, And did you say then I think you'd make a good
1457.28,1459.3600000000001," Merrill or whatever, laughing octopus?"
1459.3600000000001,1461.24," No, I don't remember what I said."
1461.24,1462.24, I'm a savior.
1462.24,1465.0800000000002," You say, you say, you say, I'll be your solid snake."
1465.0800000000002,1467.2," Come on, guys."
1467.2,1469.0800000000002, Not all right.
1469.0800000000002,1471.04," Well, we need to follow this relationship over the next"
1471.04,1471.88, number.
1471.88,1473.4," Oh, I'll hit his the first."
1473.4,1474.4, Shut up.
1474.4,1475.4, Shut up.
1475.4,1476.4, Right.
1476.4,1477.4, The series within a series.
1477.4,1480.1200000000001," We can also, I think we have at least a few female"
1480.1200000000001,1482.1200000000001, listeners and they can submit.
1482.1200000000001,1482.72," Oh, true."
1483.2,1484.48, Advice for that.
1484.48,1485.88," Yeah, there's at least nine"
1485.88,1487.64, I'm not a nine.
1487.64,1489.04, A few was three.
1489.04,1490.04, I know.
1490.04,1491.32, I was telling the two of them are forced by their
1491.32,1492.54, boyfriends to sit through it.
1492.54,1494.8," I was telling, John, I just need to start finding ran"
1494.8,1497.96, in places I go on regular basis in asking.
1497.96,1500.0, Girls out at each one of them and just coming back each
1500.0,1502.6000000000001, week with a story of how it went.
1502.6000000000001,1504.3600000000001," Black, that would be like a better."
1504.3600000000001,1506.32," Kind of Karan, you went to a Howard Stern character"
1506.32,1507.16, though.
1507.16,1508.16, I had.
1508.16,1510.2, It was it was all sincere and puppy love.
1510.2,1511.04, And you just went in a room.
1511.04,1513.04, what are you going to like talk about tonight?
1513.04,1519.04, I'd like to read those a double beef read as a number please.
1519.04,1523.04," Honestly, I, there's no way I could stomach up and I've never"
1523.04,1525.04, figured that any time seen again. It was like took.
1525.04,1527.04," That's really, it wasn't already dead."
1527.04,1531.04," Like after you did it, you weren't like, I can do anything."
1531.04,1532.04, I'm quite.
1532.04,1533.04, No.
1533.04,1535.04," While we're on the subject of love,"
1535.04,1539.04, I've got a quick hear of the web that comes from
1539.04,1541.04," the odd, the Ron Paul official forums."
1541.04,1542.04, So God.
1542.04,1546.04, I love you Ron.
1546.04,1548.04," But thanks for thup, dude."
1548.04,1551.04, Not the message I need to hear right now.
1551.04,1553.04, For the last year I gave up myself in
1553.04,1556.04, Don't lifestyle of being blind and self-absorbed
1556.04,1558.04, and internet video games.
1558.04,1560.04," Since I've heard about you,"
1560.04,1562.04," the message and the revolution,"
1562.04,1565.04, this board and multiple daily Google news searches
1565.04,1567.04," have been my routine in life,"
1567.04,1569.04, replacing unreal tournament all versions.
1569.04,1571.04, I'm going through a lot right now.
1571.04,1575.04, That words can't begin to explain.
1575.04,1578.04," Now I've got to deal with this news from you, Ron."
1578.04,1581.04, I've had an episode of my life that caused me to break down
1581.04,1582.04, last night.
1582.04,1585.04, And now I am in tears for the second time in one day.
1585.04,1587.04, This is truly fucked up.
1587.04,1589.04, I was pulling for you dog.
1589.04,1590.04, I still am.
1590.04,1592.04," You know, I spent the last half hour weeping,"
1592.04,1594.04," not crying, but weeping."
1594.04,1596.04," My two-year-old son, Sami weeping,"
1596.04,1598.04, and came to me and hug me.
1598.04,1600.04, I love my boy.
1600.04,1602.04, My first years were for me because I
1602.04,1604.04," stared in the face of impossibility,"
1604.04,1607.04," believing that some way somehow that you,"
1607.04,1610.04, we the revolution went over come the odds
1610.04,1612.04, and McCain and the RNC.
1612.04,1616.04, And he goes on and on.
1616.04,1618.04, I actually had to do some editing because McCain
1618.04,1620.04, anytime McCain comes up in this case.
1620.04,1622.04," Well, I'll read what he wrote."
1622.04,1623.04, No endorsement of it.
1623.04,1625.04, It's McFagget and he later calls him one.
1625.04,1626.04, McFuckup.
1626.04,1628.04," And sorry, it's got all serious."
1628.04,1630.04," No, she just got real."
1630.04,1634.04, But that he finishes up his insane tirade with.
1634.04,1636.04," Please, Dr. Paul."
1636.04,1639.04," Remember, please reconsider."
1639.04,1640.04," Oh, man."
1640.04,1641.04, Sorry.
1641.04,1643.04," I get, it's like it blows my mind that the"
1643.04,1646.04, Ron Paul people call themselves the revolution.
1646.04,1649.04," Like, that's the most impudent group of,"
1649.04,1651.04, like nobody's on earth.
1651.04,1653.04, And they think they're going to take over the whole
1653.04,1657.04, fucking country with their fucking jobless college student
1657.04,1658.04, dropouts.
1658.04,1659.04," Ron Paul, I guess."
1659.04,1660.04, Fuck it.
1660.04,1661.04, Fuck it.
1661.04,1662.04, I'm not.
1662.04,1665.04," Ron Paul, Ron Paul people are on like the level of"
1665.04,1666.04, Scientologists.
1666.04,1667.04, I'm sorry.
1667.04,1668.04, They're fucking crazy.
1668.04,1669.04, Yeah.
1669.04,1670.04, Now you're going to like do you get a knockout?
1670.04,1671.04, Yeah.
1671.04,1672.04, I don't care.
1672.04,1673.04, Yeah.
1673.04,1674.04, I don't care.
1674.04,1675.04, Yeah.
1675.04,1676.04," I just got, what is this shit now?"
1676.04,1678.04," Like, you see the comments and my current"
1678.04,1680.04, blog like the one about how I'm tearing the country
1680.04,1681.04, apart.
1681.04,1682.04, You personally?
1682.04,1682.52, Yeah.
1682.52,1683.04, Yeah.
1683.04,1684.04, Yeah.
1684.04,1685.04, Yeah.
1685.04,1686.04, Yeah.
1686.04,1687.04, Yeah.
1687.04,1688.04, Yeah.
1688.04,1689.04, Yeah.
1689.04,1690.04, I don't you know.
1690.04,1692.04, What does that mean?
1692.04,1693.04, Yeah.
1693.04,1694.04, Yeah.
1694.04,1695.04, Yeah.
1695.04,1696.04, You're part of it.
1696.04,1697.04, Yeah.
1697.04,1698.04, Yeah.
1698.04,1700.04, Ye sure.
1700.04,1701.04, Yeah.
1701.04,1702.04, Yeah.
1702.04,1703.04, Yeah.
1703.04,1705.04, How does that sound like.
1705.04,1706.04, Yeah.
1706.04,1707.04, Yeah.
1707.04,1710.24, get his name that Rush Limbaugh on that I don't know.
1710.24,1711.28, I don't understand hitchhiking.
1711.28,1712.8799999999999, I really tried not to turn it over.
1712.8799999999999,1716.28," If your agenda's hidden, then how fucking effective can it be?"
1716.28,1719.72," You know, you're obviously not getting much done there."
1719.72,1720.72, Sure.
1720.72,1722.92," If it's due to pre-stop and playback, we're it's pretty effective."
1722.92,1723.92, Yeah.
1723.92,1725.72, That's true.
1725.72,1726.72, You are poisons.
1726.72,1728.72, So how did you get to this Ron Paul message board by the way?
1728.72,1729.72," Yeah, wait a minute."
1729.72,1732.48, I got that from Rory and that came by way of something off the forms
1732.48,1734.6, and almost positive.
1734.6,1736.72, One of their subforms.
1736.72,1739.44," Ah, they tend to track that my favorite part there was,"
1739.44,1742.44, who the clarifying it was all versions of Leonard Real Tournament.
1742.44,1743.44," Oh, very good."
1743.44,1744.44, That was the best part.
1744.44,1745.64, That's what I was referring to.
1745.64,1748.92, Like casually reading it to show just how committed he was to this.
1748.92,1750.52," It's not just unreal, too."
1750.52,1751.52, Yeah.
1751.52,1752.52, All versions.
1752.52,1755.48, That's when Rory was reading it to us casually.
1755.48,1757.56," That's where I stopped and said, dude, said me that, please."
1757.56,1758.56, No.
1758.56,1760.2, I want it.
1760.2,1761.6000000000001, This is going on the air.
1761.6000000000001,1762.4, I don't know.
1762.4,1766.68, I'm sure that there must be like just a backtrack and not be killed.
1767.44,1770.1200000000001, Must be reasonable Ron Paul people out there.
1770.1200000000001,1773.48," But like, I don't know, everyone I meet is totally wacky."
1773.48,1777.92," I mean, I even met someone in my wife's finance PhD program at Berkeley,"
1777.92,1779.4, who was a Ron Paul fanatic.
1779.4,1783.52," And I was like, dude, that guy wants to go back on the gold standard."
1783.52,1786.24, And you're getting a PhD in finance.
1786.24,1788.4, Are you insane?
1788.4,1793.16," And he was like, oh, but he'd never be able to do that."
1793.16,1795.04," But he wants, I mean, I don't,"
1795.04,1797.76," like, people like pick and choose what they want to believe about that guy."
1797.76,1798.3999999999999," Like, yeah."
1798.3999999999999,1801.08," Like you can't, you can't just accept the whole package or something."
1801.08,1803.68," Anyway, it's the same thing with Obama."
1803.68,1805.6399999999999, You would like to read this and it's entirety then.
1805.6399999999999,1810.84," Because it hits up all the fun stuff, probably the gold standard as well."
1810.84,1812.2, So it's at it for this week.
1812.2,1814.56," Yeah, that's our, I don't know."
1814.56,1816.44, We've all been playing.
1816.44,1818.48, You've all been playing as anybody and playing anything else.
1818.48,1821.6399999999999," Is it all met a girl with everyone in the room, but me?"
1821.6399999999999,1822.24, Yeah.
1822.24,1824.24, I didn't play it some while.
1824.24,1825.24, What am I?
1825.24,1827.48, We'll save that for the next podcast.
1827.48,1828.68, We're legendary threading it out.
1828.68,1830.48," What are you playing there, Jeff?"
1830.48,1831.48, Anything?
1831.48,1832.48, I'm still playing that.
1832.48,1833.48," So, fact on the PC."
1833.48,1834.48, Yeah.
1834.48,1835.48, How do you like it?
1835.48,1836.48, I like it a lot.
1836.48,1837.64, I like a lot more if it didn't crash every two minutes.
1837.64,1838.64, We just fit up a very hard drive.
1838.64,1839.64, Have you ever viewed today?
1839.64,1840.64, Did we?
1840.64,1841.64, Yeah.
1841.64,1842.64, Would we give it a minus?
1842.64,1843.64, A minus?
1843.64,1844.64, A minus?
1844.64,1845.64, Oh.
1845.64,1847.64, That's believable.
1847.64,1848.64, A minus.
1848.64,1849.64, Who reviewed it?
1849.64,1850.64, Sean.
1850.64,1851.64," Scuder, I think."
1851.64,1852.64, Which means it's probably about what I would do.
1852.64,1854.2, Which means it's just as good as metal gear solid for.
1854.2,1855.2, Yeah.
1855.2,1856.8, But not as good as boom blocks.
1856.8,1857.8, Yeah.
1857.8,1858.8, There's people in the middle of that.
1858.8,1859.8," This is a problem, man."
1859.8,1860.8," Oh, God."
1860.8,1861.8, Now you're going to have to make fun of it.
1861.8,1865.6000000000001," I didn't want to bring big it up, but now I feel, now I'm like, I feel like I"
1865.6000000000001,1866.6000000000001, have to.
1866.6000000000001,1867.6000000000001, OK.
1867.6000000000001,1871.0," Because like on one of yours last week, they were comparing the scores in between"
1871.0,1875.2, different games of different genres and presumably written by different critics in another
1875.2,1878.2, publication.
1878.2,1882.8, And I hated to hear that because it opens you up for the reverse.
1882.8,1887.8," And that would be if it didn't make sense to compare, you know, the review scores for"
1887.8,1891.6," any two games of any genres, and even though there were different critics that reviewed"
1891.6,1892.6, them.
1892.6,1898.72," Then that means people can compare whatever they can say that boom blocks is, oh, a better"
1898.72,1900.8, game than Super Mario Galaxy or something.
1900.8,1904.8," And that's like, I don't think any of us believe in that or something."
1904.8,1905.8, That's absurd.
1905.8,1906.8, Yes.
1906.8,1907.8, Is the right word?
1907.8,1909.8, As the reviews editor of the one of the work.
1909.8,1911.8, I'd say this that's ridiculous.
1911.8,1917.6, You can't bet on why is it ridiculous because otherwise people are going to point out
1917.6,1920.8, that Ryan Scott thinks that puzzle quest is better than Metal Gear.
1920.8,1921.8, He probably does.
1921.8,1925.8," I think that puzzle quest is awesome, but it's like, I didn't review Metal Gear."
1925.8,1926.8, Right.
1926.8,1929.8," Well, plus it's your playing that game, obviously, for completely different reasons."
1929.8,1930.8, And then different times.
1930.8,1931.8, Right.
1931.8,1932.8, But let's be serious.
1932.8,1934.8, I'll never objective fun a meter.
1934.8,1935.8, Objective fun.
1935.8,1936.8, Objective.
1936.8,1939.8, I thought it was a phenomenon.
1939.8,1940.8, Yeah.
1940.8,1941.8, That was really fucked up.
1941.8,1942.8, That was made mean subjective.
1942.8,1946.8, That being subjective.
1946.8,1949.8," So I'm really, I'm really liking that."
1949.8,1950.8, Mass Effect on the PC.
1950.8,1951.8, And I think the.
1951.8,1954.8, I think the crash is actually have nothing to do with the game.
1954.8,1955.8, I believe it's my F.
1955.8,1956.8, F.
1956.8,1957.8, PC.
1957.8,1958.8, Where am I?
1958.8,1959.8, I've been on Sporleery.
1959.8,1960.8, An on Sporleery way.
1960.8,1969.8," Well, I've gone through at least three of the huge, you know, other planet long extended missions."
1969.8,1971.8, I don't have to do this without spoiling.
1971.8,1973.8, But maybe you just have to.
1973.8,1974.8, I believe I'm.
1974.8,1975.8, I'm.
1975.8,1976.8, I'm.
1976.8,1977.8, I think I'm well on the way.
1977.8,1978.8," You know, I'm a good."
1978.8,1980.8, Good 20 hours in.
1980.8,1982.8, I'd say I don't know how long the game is.
1982.8,1983.8, I've been.
1983.8,1984.8, I've been.
1984.8,1987.8, Dorking around with some of the side quests is going to other planets.
1987.8,1988.8, And check them out.
1988.8,1994.8, And I've been enjoying the varied terrain and the varied environments of the different places.
1994.8,1998.8, Except for the fact that I noticed by the third planet and now it's driving me fucking crazy every time.
1998.8,2002.8, It's just one of those random suspensions of disbelief that it's nothing.
2002.8,2004.8," It's stupid, but I can't stop being annoyed by it."
2004.8,2007.8," No matter, you know, you can go to all different solar systems in the game."
2007.8,2008.8, We don't guess I'll play it.
2008.8,2011.8, This is why I didn't get any plus right.
2011.8,2012.8, Right.
2012.8,2014.8, That's particularly reason right here.
2014.8,2015.8, I didn't review it.
2015.8,2020.8," It was on the cons, you know, it was the on the negatives, you know,"
2020.8,2021.8, what?
2021.8,2022.8, That's obviously why.
2022.8,2023.8, Right.
2023.8,2024.8," Oh, that's why it must be."
2024.8,2025.8, Yeah.
2025.8,2026.8," Well, I'm sure you play games like me."
2026.8,2027.8, You're like me.
2027.8,2028.8, You're like me.
2028.8,2030.8," When you start the game, but the sound was an 8.5."
2030.8,2031.8, What's up?
2031.8,2033.8, What's up with this part?
2033.8,2034.8, What?
2034.8,2035.8, Okay.
2035.8,2036.8, Go ahead.
2036.8,2037.8, What?
2037.8,2039.8," I was going to say if you play games like me, you turn it on and it's a C."
2039.8,2043.8, And then as you play like you add a C plus of like some cool happens.
2043.8,2045.8," And then like, oh, this is annoying back down to C."
2045.8,2046.8, Right.
2046.8,2047.8, Right.
2047.8,2050.8, Usually with like a tally thing right next to my computer.
2050.8,2051.8, I could do it in my head.
2051.8,2052.8, Yeah.
2052.8,2053.8, I got it.
2053.8,2054.8, That's actually how I deal with people too.
2055.8,2059.8," Generally like when I meet or now a B-mirus, they're just about at C into the Cs."
2059.8,2060.8, It proves me wrong.
2060.8,2061.8, Yeah.
2061.8,2062.8, I'm kind of a pessimist.
2062.8,2063.8, You're nice.
2063.8,2064.8, I don't have a lot of it.
2064.8,2065.8, They have for me.
2065.8,2066.8, Yeah.
2066.8,2067.8, They get a workout from it.
2067.8,2069.8, There's some truth that they just for me.
2069.8,2070.8," But like, yeah."
2070.8,2073.8," Like you see, like an anime avatar."
2073.8,2074.8, And then you'll meet Lee.
2074.8,2076.8, I would drop some down about a D.
2076.8,2079.8," And then like, they're way back up."
2079.8,2083.8, An anime avatar with the metal gear iPad.
2083.8,2084.8, Yeah.
2084.8,2085.8, I'm sorry.
2085.8,2086.8, I'm sorry.
2086.8,2087.8, What's the D-mirus?
2087.8,2088.8, Yeah.
2088.8,2089.8, Yeah.
2089.8,2090.8, I'm sorry.
2090.8,2093.8," But at the end of the video point in there is that yeah, we do make assumptions."
2093.8,2094.8, Yeah.
2094.8,2095.8, And sometimes they're accurate.
2095.8,2096.8," I really, I can."
2096.8,2098.8, Why assumed I was going to like this game.
2098.8,2099.8, And I ended up really like in it a lot.
2099.8,2101.8, So what was your problem with it?
2101.8,2107.8, The problem was the elevators not not the fact that there's so many of them because there are.
2107.8,2109.8, And I which is what I guess they use for the load times.
2109.8,2110.8, What plan is your on?
2110.8,2111.8, This is the mask effect.
2111.8,2112.8, Right.
2112.8,2113.8, And then you can get the same thing.
2113.8,2114.8, Yeah.
2114.8,2115.8, Yes.
2115.8,2117.8, Every because you're going to different solar systems and different galaxies.
2117.8,2119.8, It's like this whole universe in this game.
2119.8,2122.8, Or all the elevators were designed by the same company.
2122.8,2123.8, Otis.
2123.8,2125.8, Because I all have the same green button.
2125.8,2126.8, I don't know.
2126.8,2129.8, I just said it's a monopoly in all the restaurants to talk about.
2129.8,2130.8, Yeah.
2130.8,2131.8, Hit that one thing by the demolition.
2131.8,2132.8, It's a little thing.
2132.8,2133.8, Yeah.
2133.8,2136.8, But I wanted to see one other elevator design on some other planet.
2136.8,2138.8," That's worth the name, I miss."
2138.8,2139.8, That's why I can't.
2139.8,2140.8, You should download the elevator path.
2140.8,2141.8, I'm just kidding.
2141.8,2142.8, It's a little bit of a puzzle.
2142.8,2143.8, It's only like five bucks.
2143.8,2145.8, And you get like six or seven different elevators.
2145.8,2146.8, Really?
2146.8,2147.8, Yeah.
2147.8,2148.8, Okay.
2148.8,2149.8, So you can give a glass one.
2149.8,2151.8, That perfect downloadable content.
2151.8,2152.8, Yeah.
2152.8,2153.8, The original thing.
2153.8,2154.8, I still have it.
2154.8,2155.8, I still have it.
2155.8,2157.8, I was thinking about playing it on PC because I didn't play it on.
2157.8,2158.8, It is.
2158.8,2159.8, I'm loving it.
2159.8,2160.8, I'm still.
2160.8,2161.8, I'm over.
2161.8,2163.8, Even with all the the crash bug.
2163.8,2166.8, Because what's happening to me is I'm crashing straight out to the desktop.
2166.8,2167.8, No warning.
2167.8,2169.8, I moved and all of a sudden I'm at the desktop.
2169.8,2172.8, I can immediately reload it and be back in and I like the game so much.
2172.8,2174.8, That pain in the ass is actually not deterring me.
2174.8,2180.8, Do you find yourself playing specifically as like a good guy or a bad guy or you just kind of taking it as a comb?
2180.8,2188.8, I am being a paragon almost 100% of the time except when the person I'm talking to is incredibly annoying.
2188.8,2193.8, Then I'm willing to go down to the medium or the shut the fuck up.
2193.8,2194.8, So basically you're playing it like that.
2194.8,2196.8, I'm being as good as I can and you're still annoying.
2196.8,2197.8, That's fucked you.
2197.8,2199.8, So you're playing it like how you imagine you might in real life.
2199.8,2201.8, It's pretty mad at us with the gun.
2201.8,2202.8," Yeah, this guy."
2202.8,2203.8, Exactly.
2203.8,2204.8, Yeah.
2204.8,2206.8, I said I'd help you and you're still whining.
2206.8,2208.8, So you got one more chance.
2208.8,2211.8, One more line of dialogue where you're being a dick and you're out.
2211.8,2212.8, I'm picking that.
2212.8,2213.8, The red dialogue.
2213.8,2214.8, Yeah.
2214.8,2215.8, Your character.
2215.8,2216.8, Don't test me.
2216.8,2217.8, It's your character or a guy or a girl.
2217.8,2218.8, It's a guy.
2218.8,2220.8, I don't cross game in general.
2220.8,2221.8, I did it in every one.
2221.8,2223.8, I did it in every quest one.
2223.8,2224.8, In secure are we.
2224.8,2225.8," Well, I mean,"
2225.8,2227.8, see my tips and Conan.
2227.8,2230.8, I just dress up in real life.
2230.8,2232.8, While playing as a guy in these games.
2232.8,2235.8, I still just have to have a role behind.
2235.8,2237.8, That's the only way to satisfy your dreams.
2237.8,2240.8, I still have some nice launcher that I wear a play while.
2240.8,2241.8," So I mean,"
2241.8,2243.8, Are you into the game story?
2243.8,2245.8, I am kind of what I was interested in.
2245.8,2246.8," No, I am."
2246.8,2250.8, That's what I'm saying is that by where does this to me in a way that no other.
2250.8,2253.8, Almost no other game company I can say does where.
2254.8,2257.8, Where the story I actually do get sucked into the story after a while.
2257.8,2260.8," Sometimes there's a little bit of like, I don't know about this."
2260.8,2262.8," But in the case of this game, it got to me."
2262.8,2263.8, This was a slow burn for me.
2263.8,2264.8, It was a very slow burn.
2264.8,2268.8, I had to get out of city area to do it.
2268.8,2271.8, But they do enough kind of nice.
2271.8,2274.8," Sort of moments of not like big like,"
2274.8,2276.8," who turns of character, but just sort of like,"
2276.8,2277.8," Oh, shit."
2277.8,2279.8, Turns of characters that get.
2279.8,2280.8, There's a different thing.
2281.8,2282.8, I know.
2282.8,2283.8, Yeah.
2283.8,2284.8, Big difference.
2284.8,2288.8," You know, I mean, it's not just fake like last minute like bogus twist."
2288.8,2290.8," What Ryan, Ryan's raising."
2290.8,2291.8, You're gonna knock the wall down.
2291.8,2293.8, You're tearing the lock in the wall down.
2293.8,2294.8, I'm telling you.
2294.8,2295.8, I'm excited.
2295.8,2296.8, I am.
2296.8,2297.8, Just second job is collade man.
2297.8,2298.8, Give him a pen to eat.
2298.8,2299.8," Oh, yeah."
2299.8,2301.8, Okay.
2301.8,2302.8, I'll stop tearing down the wall.
2302.8,2303.8," Oh, shit."
2303.8,2304.8, Keep your shoes on.
2304.8,2306.8, Pettad to your mouth and the wall from follow up.
2306.8,2307.8, Yeah.
2307.8,2308.8, I want to step up my glasses.
2308.8,2309.8, Okay.
2310.8,2314.8," Like the scene with the, I'll just hint at a spoiler,"
2314.8,2318.8," but the scene with the, the giant insect queen."
2318.8,2319.8, Yes.
2319.8,2321.8," Then controlling the, I know what you're talking about."
2321.8,2322.8, That's a good thing.
2322.8,2325.8, Does anyone of us here care if you say it or explicit detail?
2325.8,2326.8," But it, what, what, what, what?"
2326.8,2329.8," We're going to tell me like, how many eyes this insect queen has."
2329.8,2331.8, It's going to put in here or some threshold.
2331.8,2332.8, I wanted to play the game.
2332.8,2336.8, When did the spoiler and thing turn into such a crazy like religion?
2336.8,2337.8," I mean, you're right."
2337.8,2340.8, That you didn't like reveal like crucial story moments.
2340.8,2343.8, That's something like think like it's a one-to-experience.
2343.8,2346.8," But it's like, I don't want to see that there's a snow level."
2346.8,2347.8, Okay.
2347.8,2348.8, Right.
2348.8,2349.8, I know how many that there's a snow level.
2349.8,2351.8, Look at the fucking screenshots for two years.
2351.8,2352.8, You're right.
2352.8,2353.8, Breathing about it.
2353.8,2354.8," I mean, it gets, it gets crazy."
2354.8,2356.8," I mean, I know what you're talking about here."
2356.8,2358.8, Because this is one of those moments that like made me go.
2358.8,2361.8, I like this game because I wasn't expecting the following thing to happen.
2361.8,2362.8," I mean, I can start to understand that."
2362.8,2364.8," That's what I'm saying is like, you're going along."
2364.8,2366.8, It's kind of your basic space opera.
2366.8,2370.8," You know, there's some mystery to be solved, having to do with this, you know,"
2370.8,2375.8," this beacon that has something to do with some, some wiped out old civilization."
2375.8,2377.8, And you're following this mystery along.
2377.8,2378.8, But then everyone's in a while.
2378.8,2385.8, There's a cutscene where they do things to the characters or in certain moments that that are just nice pieces of story telling.
2385.8,2387.8, Because you didn't see it coming.
2387.8,2391.8," You know, the story is on a straight trajectory that you see in every other game."
2391.8,2394.8, But then they will do these kind of nice little curveballs.
2394.8,2396.8, Are they make you go?
2396.8,2402.8," Curveballs that are surprising because they were like inconceivable or are they,"
2402.8,2406.8," you know, sort of like delightful because if you, if you had thought about it long enough,"
2406.8,2410.8," you maybe could have anticipated it, but you're sort of slapping yourself."
2410.8,2414.8, There's nothing like a preposterous in this game that I recall.
2414.8,2415.8, Yeah.
2415.8,2416.8, Yeah.
2416.8,2417.8, It's not proper.
2417.8,2419.8," I mean, and that's what it feels like to me just good storytelling."
2419.8,2422.8," Like as I've been playing this I've been thinking, if this was a movie,"
2422.8,2424.8, I'd be enjoying this movie a lot.
2424.8,2428.8," And in fact, the way the story progressed a lot of the stuff at the beginning that I thought was stupid."
2428.8,2430.8," I'm like, why is that there?"
2430.8,2435.8," That dumb who don't thought that there later, ten hours later, like, oh, that's why that was there."
2435.8,2437.8," And it's actually like, okay, that's not stupid anymore."
2437.8,2439.8," And I'm sorry, I got all this stupid stuff."
2439.8,2440.8, It's still the whole check off.
2440.8,2444.8," And if there's a shot shot, it's gonna show up in the third deck."
2444.8,2446.8," Yeah, it mostly had to do with like,"
2446.8,2450.8, when they started explaining how the Citadel works and I just did not buy it.
2450.8,2455.8," I was just like, how did civilization advance this far without anyone asking these questions?"
2455.8,2459.8," And then my later kind of just like, oh, okay, that makes sense."
2459.8,2467.8," So Jeff, I got, yeah, so which way you lean and you're gonna, you're gonna go and sexually pursue the human or the alien."
2467.8,2469.8, Because at some point you gotta make it show up.
2469.8,2472.8, And just remember that this is your only chance to get with an alien.
2472.8,2474.8, It's never gonna happen again.
2474.8,2475.8," You know, you get one chance."
2475.8,2477.8," You know, you've pretty hot your whole life."
2477.8,2478.8, You can blow it.
2478.8,2479.8," You know, you're gonna have to do human."
2479.8,2481.8, She's pretty hot to salient too.
2481.8,2484.8," You know, I'm definitely like, you know, have looked, you know,"
2484.8,2486.8," Dump, Dump, Dumpel takes the monitor going fuck."
2486.8,2487.8," I mean, she's blue."
2487.8,2489.8, She's got these kind of weird gill things.
2489.8,2491.8," And just just the mystery, you don't know what's down there."
2491.8,2492.8," I mean, I like to see."
2492.8,2496.8," It could, well, now you're, see, now you're traumatizing."
2496.8,2499.8, I guess I got to stick with the human.
2499.8,2502.8, I want to do it.
2502.8,2503.8, I want to do it.
2503.8,2504.8, I want to do it.
2504.8,2505.8, I want to do it.
2505.8,2506.8, I want to do it.
2506.8,2508.8, Like what if it gets delivered to another person.
2508.8,2509.8, That is a stupid question.
2509.8,2512.8, What if the next person isgeb estÃ£o up in the script.
2512.8,2515.8," Like if they've done a crime, the diteling is located on the run."
2515.8,2516.8," So at the first time open July 20,"
2516.8,2517.8,ð
2517.8,2521.8, I have an opportunity to name the answer to the theme of comparison between people.
2521.8,2523.8," And if you're publishers, what if its in the ad provide for people easily?"
2523.8,2524.8, Like yeah.
2524.8,2525.8," And if you've lifted a dance system,"
2525.8,2527.8," that's like form,"
2527.8,2528.8, that means you finish it.
2528.8,2531.8, It's absolutely hard in a passive way Lol!
2531.8,2534.8,Î³Ã¨te 42 and college data for VR being to open
2534.8,2539.1800000000003, That's what I was getting to suggest is the alien got both parts before Robert got to his genus
2539.1800000000003,2541.54, He just heard neutral. She's not so you just spoiled it for me
2541.82,2547.42," Did this hit them beginning yeah, yeah, that hurt like a pair of race whole races just now you're paying attention"
2547.42,2549.42, It just fueled your interest. They all look
2550.6000000000004,2554.26," They all like one to here. They'll look like females, but if you read the lore"
2554.54,2561.1200000000003," Yeah, you're gonna have to tender. She takes it two ways like the now your cooking line of girls boy. They kind of they're adapted the rolling paints a cookie cutter"
2561.12,2566.2799999999997, We're not gonna really can be a cookie. It's not like the crying game. I didn't spoil
2566.2799999999997,2571.06," Okay, it's not okay. It's not like I would make that decision and there'd be a cutscene to be going into the room"
2571.06,2573.06, No
2573.06,2576.0, You should know what you're getting into by now come here. Oh boy
2577.2,2580.48, But maybe you would have since you hadn't been paying attention that would have been pretty funny
2580.88,2582.88," Yeah, what have been"
2582.88,2586.94," We're not so anyway. Do you play jade empire? No, I did not know I"
2586.94,2592.5," I feared that I played played play jade empire, but do not finish jade empire. What do you like better?"
2592.5,2599.2400000000002," I like massive fucker. Okay, but I played a little bit of this on Xbox and for some reason I couldn't get behind it on Xbox"
2599.2400000000002,2604.68, I think I think my brain goes into a different mode when the Xbox is on and I want something
2605.78,2608.78, faster paced than the slow pace of
2608.78,2615.18," Of a game like mass effect. I think I need my RPGs to be on the PC. That's just me, but I think that's the way it has to be"
2615.74,2624.62," So when I heard Dr. Ray, you know, and Greg and others of Byward say that that they thought this was their best game way back"
2625.02,2627.54, When I was just was just dabbling on the Xbox
2627.54,2630.98, I was just like I don't know what those guys were thinking or they've lost it on the way
2630.98,2633.3799999999997, But now that I've I'm deep into mass effect
2633.3799999999997,2637.74, I definitely think this is holding up with the best games of this company is done
2638.18,2640.1, a fine effettin d
2640.18,2642.18, Yes
2644.18,2647.0, Like the only way I can end this is with a funny boy. I can't
2647.9,2649.9," Settings self-contrasts so yeah, I'm"
2652.86,2658.8199999999997," Yeah, alright, it's good. What is this? I don't know somebody's cue card from some other podcast"
2658.8199999999997,2663.7," Which just goes to show you how little we prepare. We're not a fucking cue card. Yeah, Sean has some printouts"
2664.7,2666.86, I got a tight out cue card
2666.86,2671.94," Somebody not only is a cue card, but it's typed that's true on a type run blue on special blue cards"
2673.34,2675.34, Are we gonna read it already?
2675.34,2677.82, We don't have a cell we don't want to out the Southern podcast
2678.1400000000003,2684.3," Right, is it a good question? No, it's kind of right. So if you don't like mental gher'sod for are you a peasant?"
2684.3,2686.3, That's the question. So
2686.3,2688.3, Oh
2688.3,2693.9," We're gonna take a break. Yeah, we'll take a break and I guess Ryan do we think three yet here?"
2694.46,2700.26," Getting out of here for the milk your salt for a talk okay. Oh, that's that do you have any last words for Sean the light any last public words"
2702.1800000000003,2703.1800000000003, Public words gosh
2703.1800000000003,2708.54, You should tell me you should tell him you you wanted to hang out for the rest of his last podcast
2708.94,2712.26," Working with you, but you didn't want to spoil metal gears cell for"
2715.58,2717.58, Like you were just not that much
2718.14,2721.82, Not more than he likes the game. Yeah. I don't want to know what happens to vamp
2722.2200000000003,2725.2200000000003, The hang he gets shot any stance back up
2734.78,2736.78, Actually
2739.2200000000003,2741.2200000000003, Okay
2741.2200000000003,2743.2200000000003," All right, Sean Sean the light well"
2744.54,2750.5, It's been good working with these two years and you know Sean Elliot pretty much some to doubt like it's a big loss
2751.82,2756.1600000000003, We miss you to be over get a damn not dying we should have brought some like tasty
2757.26,2759.5, You're dead to us
2760.78,2766.82," No, you welcome back anytime cool. I'll be back as long as you want to you know run the stuff"
2771.54,2773.54, Silver wheels
2773.54,2776.34, God we're so glad he came back we can figure this
2776.34,2782.34, I mean really this is easy
2783.6200000000003,2788.34," No, you want to do it. It's where no we can't what's not easiest cut into our break"
2789.9,2791.9," Okay, we'll be back"
2806.34,2809.3, Okay
2809.3,2815.1800000000003," Wow, that was I can't do mine in my laughing we were we're gonna weird that was our dolphin off Robert Ashley"
2815.1800000000003,2817.94, It was really short it was we can both be dolphin
2818.58,2822.58," But our team that was yeah, yeah, I suppose to be it's often"
2827.58,2829.1000000000004, I can't I can't
2829.1,2836.74, So convincing Robert is so convincing I'm visualizing before me as this happens that you're it's your little kid at sea world and he's an actual dolphin
2841.74,2844.18, I spent a lot of time by myself as a child
2845.18,2850.18, Basically just go I can also sing songs as a chicken
2851.1,2854.94," Really, okay, we're getting it to the metal solid like"
2855.94,2857.94, What should I happy birthday
2859.1,2861.1, I
2875.1,2877.1, Say it was twitching
2878.54,2882.38, Look a chicken like I was possessed by the spirit of the chicken
2882.38,2885.1, I don't know why people say where is it low brow podcast
2885.1,2887.1, I
2887.5,2891.94," And that made as much sense as the beginning of the title gear so before yeah, good nice"
2891.94,2899.06," Great, okay, so I guess I'm the only one in this room who has not played it and is probably not going to be the control group"
2899.06,2903.02, Then you can you can you listen to this in Stanley. I'm halfway through Madagur solid one
2903.3399999999997,2905.3399999999997, So I
2905.3399999999997,2909.3399999999997, So I'm a behind but I sort of I have the gist of sort of what
2909.9,2913.6, What at least these games are about by the way this next whatever
2913.6,2920.24, minutes gonna be fooled to the brim with the letters if we didn't make that clear before if you don't want this game spoiled
2920.3199999999997,2924.3199999999997, Just turn it off don't be mad if you hear him now because we've warned you in more times
2924.3199999999997,2927.68, You hear them after after this last warning here
2928.08,2935.92," It touched it you're playing one you're halfway through the first one. Yeah, so it's like basically you're listening to the Beatles before acid"
2936.7999999999997,2941.88," Like it's right. Yeah, okay, you're playing the game before it turns to utter insanity"
2942.6800000000003,2948.36," Okay, so I'm listening to it. Please please me. Yeah, you guys are on I am the walrus. Yeah, basically"
2948.6800000000003,2949.6800000000003, Okay
2949.6800000000003,2954.8, We're being on the one. Please please me at this point is still kind of there's still some weird shit
2954.8,2958.6800000000003," I mean, I've seen you know, there's guys named revolver Ocelad and you know"
2958.6800000000003,2961.0, He got his hand cut out let's just say you're on revolver
2964.6800000000003,2967.0," Yeah, so it's a wacky"
2967.0,2974.2, It's really really weird right after yeah on your day trip or on your way to strawberry field forever
2975.76,2977.76, Stop stop blowing my mind
2977.76,2980.76," No, we're watching okay, right. I'm sorry for okay, so"
2982.12,2984.8, So the games been out a week now or less on a week
2986.72,2992.18," Sean you were not on one of yours because you're not on that podcast anymore, but they they talked about it this past week"
2992.44,2995.74," Right, well, and also I mean like in that case if I"
2996.2599999999998,3000.18, Didn't get the game until after they take that like Friday
3000.18,3004.8799999999997, I didn't start playing till Friday evening and then I spent like all that night and you put all the weekend
3004.8799999999997,3007.08, Poops on me so one thing we do know is
3007.08,3011.4799999999996, What they talked about I want appears and just the reviews of general apparently
3012.2999999999997,3019.3799999999997, Everybody said Grant F. Dato for it was the greatest fucking game ever needed to wait another month and a half because now this one's the best game
3019.3799999999997,3024.14," Right at least some GTA for according to a lot of these reviews. Well, yeah, so not every review"
3024.8599999999997,3031.1, In fact probably less there is it what's the quote? Let's get the quote from from Jeremy Paris's review
3031.1,3036.9, Not from his review it from a comment on the review. It was like this game is an A plus plus plus I
3037.5,3040.22, Recreate ever playing any game I ever played before this one
3042.14,3044.14, I'd like to
3044.14,3049.62," Yeah, super great so it's just like the next stage is like I regret having even been alive prior to this game"
3051.02,3054.1, Nothing good. There's nothing left for the next game
3054.14,3060.22, That's better than MGS for now the hyperbly bars been raised so so high now. What are you gonna say?
3060.5,3062.5, What's this up to invent a new language
3067.7,3069.22, Super late game hyper
3069.22,3074.92," That's all I can say so. Yeah, let's go all in that. I mean, right? All right, so you"
3075.42,3081.22, Let's get into a way from you finish it. I did I'm on the tail and the back three
3081.22,3086.2999999999997, I don't know where you are I forgot in act three. I'm about nine hours in and I'm only like two
3086.2999999999997,3093.14, Like I think I'm in the 11 so who would just want to start I mean with your impression so I mean like I can launch in any one of you
3093.14,3096.14, Welcome to I could say that I
3097.22,3105.06, Really was a big not I mean I was pretty into the original of Metal Gear Solid and I played two and found it slightly baffling
3105.06,3107.06, But really fun
3107.06,3115.34, Then I desperately tried to play three like when when three came out snake eater like I tried to play the original version of it and just
3115.74,3119.82, Could not deal with I couldn't deal with like the wide open spaces with like the worst
3120.2999999999997,3123.62, Overhead camera thing I couldn't deal with like hiding in the bushes every two minutes
3123.62,3129.34, I used to play that game with a book because when I got caught I'd find my hiding space then read the book
3129.34,3133.52," Yeah, this has been a longstanding problem. I think yeah, with the series"
3133.52,3139.6," I mean, maybe not so much now because it's is viable option to just sort of for ghost elf when you are caught"
3139.6,3143.04," Yeah, but if you are either in those games or if you are determined"
3143.4,3149.32, That you do want to take a stealthy approach or some sections in Metal Gear Solid 4 where you do have to in fact
3150.16,3157.88," Yeah, the timer is the series of timers three timers take so long that you bet your better off doing something or in most cases"
3157.88,3160.68, A lot of us like Shawn and I were talking we'll just do something suicidal
3160.68,3165.7599999999998, Then you just go stay out and open it like that because you'll start to game with the full bar and you won't have to it
3165.7599999999998,3170.16, It will take less time to reload the the game than it will just sit there and wait and wait
3170.16,3174.04," Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I mean and I play I couldn't finish that one"
3174.04,3178.3399999999997, So I bought the subsistence version with the better camera and I tried to play it again
3178.3399999999997,3181.98, And it got about six hours in and literally took it to e-be games
3181.98,3190.2999999999997, So I would stop trying to play it because I've got seven fury. It was like yelling and I was just the game
3190.3,3195.4, Has has turned into pussy and this is why good. You're not reviewing it exactly
3195.4,3201.6200000000003," I'm I'm mega pussy, but I got to get I have to get like the people on the internet off my mind"
3201.6200000000003,3206.2000000000003, I think we should all make a pact after this discussion that we will not look at any commentary whatsoever
3206.2000000000003,3210.34, You are so podcast for a blog. I know I'm tempted to I've done well
3210.34,3212.0600000000004, I haven't looked at commentary for my blog
3212.0600000000004,3214.5, I've had people past me some lines from it
3214.6600000000003,3219.26, But I think to keep to maintain our sanity and just know in the same way that like you know
3219.26,3221.26," If you're on company here, it was in and in the um"
3222.6600000000003,3226.82, So like that I suppose I said that I'm like someone's gonna respond negatively about that
3226.82,3228.7000000000003, But I refer to that because I play it again a lot
3228.7000000000003,3233.2000000000003, So if I'm in the chat channel and there people talking about how global warming's a lie climate change is bullshit
3233.9,3240.5, Obama is a terrorist and a Muslim like I have no more interest in reading people there is a trauma than than
3242.2200000000003,3246.6200000000003," Stuff but it's just like getting to the point where you say yes, there are people out there who's"
3247.14,3249.98, Thoughts and opinions you have zero interest sure sure
3250.2999999999997,3255.8599999999997, But the the the thing is though like after that I really I kind of was not even gonna
3256.58,3262.48, Deal with the new one I couldn't see how it would be you know fun to play and I was really surprised
3262.74,3267.66, How how like just as the the game had changed to the point of being
3268.2999999999997,3273.7, So much less stressful and having so much more release in it like my problem with three
3273.7,3277.74, Specifically was that it was just constant tension you were just waiting
3277.74,3280.72, You're hoping not to get spotted and have to wait around for three minutes
3280.72,3284.46, So you're always on the edge and there was never any release until you got to these like
3284.8599999999997,3288.66," Boss battles, you know, I don't know where or you get to like a cinematic and you're like"
3289.14,3292.98," Okay, now I'm now I'm not gonna be caught. I've reached like a checkpoint"
3292.98,3301.18, But there's something has happened in the game that I would say is nearly on the level of of the transformation from like resonative
3301.94,3308.98, The original series to Resident Evil 4 and that they I think they really give you more of a
3309.8199999999997,3314.1, Tense and release kind of feel where you know either still tension there
3314.1,3317.1, But if you get caught you can kill the dudes and run for it
3317.1,3324.66, You can make it out you can you know put play it and play it more boldly not not play so that you're sneaking like as slow as possible
3324.66,3330.1, Hoping not to get caught I play it a lot more boldly than I played the other games and I don't really if I get caught
3330.1,3334.96, I can make it out. It's fun and I just find it so much more enjoyable as a game
3335.68,3338.88, Apart from any like story considerations or any of that stuff
3338.88,3345.8199999999997, I find it so much more enjoyable than then then three had been and I can actually play it and have a good time
3345.8199999999997,3347.8199999999997, You know I'm kind of the point where
3348.42,3355.7," Like like you said like there is that definite release, but in my head it's kind of like I've realized that like none of it matters like"
3355.7,3359.7, I'm picking up so many weapons and it's so easy to get out of a situation by just
3360.1,3363.2999999999997, Mowing everyone down with one of the 900 machine guns you happened to have picked up
3363.7,3367.74, That it's just like I don't feel any I don't feel with tension part of it anymore
3367.74,3371.2599999999998," Yeah, like I'll go through an area and maybe later there like you said later"
3371.2599999999998,3374.62, There's some areas where you definitely have to stealth through but I feel like some there's some very
3374.62,3376.94, Like once it clicked that like shooting was an option
3378.1,3383.02," More so than the other ones where I would totally just give up if I got spotted. Yeah, there's a nice I've realized it's like"
3383.62,3386.2599999999998, Beyond just an option. It's just like it just yeah
3386.26,3389.5, Just shoot everyone and get to the next area and you're done. It's fine. I think even the mark two
3390.1000000000004,3394.98, diminishes some of the detention when you are imposing the stealth option on yourself when you're basically
3394.98,3400.9, You know eliminating an option and you choose to use stealth because you take the thing if you haven't used it yet
3401.6600000000003,3404.5, It's practically foolproof and in most circumstances
3404.5,3407.7000000000003, So if they're too guards standing right beside one another and as long as you know
3407.7000000000003,3413.34, You can stealth you know invisible and you pull behind one and you'll electrocute him he'll fall down right next to
3414.3,3419.78, Is Comrade or whatever without alerting him and you just then repeat and get him and then so what happens?
3419.78,3426.02, Is his constant series of leapfrogging with the mark two and then moving yourself forward to picking up their guns and so on and so forth
3426.02,3427.02, And that's like
3427.02,3431.6600000000003, No one's forcing you to play that but it's worth pointing out though that like I remember you know when Tom Chick reviewed
3432.1400000000003,3436.08, Dark aside might magic is big problem if I'm remembering correctly
3436.08,3441.2200000000003, I could have as wrong is that you could kick your way through the game right and so some people were
3441.7799999999997,3447.52, Challenging this is like well does that mean everyone did that or that mean you had to do it if you found some but for me
3447.52,3454.08, I think it's it's not absolutely game right but but you I do feel sort of like I'm exploiting it when I use the more I feel the same way
3454.08,3457.12, I even about the strength to stop like I feel like
3457.7799999999997,3463.06, If there's three guys and like you know a position where you should be able to sneak in a specific way to knock its
3463.06,3465.0, Botted I can I feel like in his pull out the trend gun
3465.52,3467.0, And they all fall asleep
3467.0,3471.1, Without a learning drink gun. I just use the hand gun with a silencer
3471.1,3475.82," Yeah, it just makes it a lot of times like maybe the guy next time will get the explanation point"
3475.82,3479.7, The camo suits so effective usually in a position like if you're at 80% which
3479.94,3486.0," You can get that pretty easily. Yeah, the guy I'll get the explanation point and all you have to do is pop him the head before he even spots you and then he'll go down"
3486.0,3487.84," Right, so there's a bad shot"
3487.84,3491.16, Maybe I'm just a bad shot because I've had it where I've hit one and they still have time to
3491.68,3494.38, If you give him a head shot they go down right away and the other things
3494.38,3501.84, Don't like like the fancy soldiers you can't head shots with the mark to you or the the other gun don't work with the fancy soldiers
3501.84,3505.42," Oh, I got all of the ones who like the ones that evaporate like that right"
3505.42,3509.02," Yeah, well, that's usually in an action sequence anyway. Yeah, there's a couple parts for it"
3509.02,3512.6600000000003," There's there yeah, there's like a sneak that's crazy like elaborate"
3513.82,3519.46," Later tracking the set. Yeah, which was the worst thing that I've played in the game so far. You're about to hit something even worse"
3521.06,3523.06, What
3523.7799999999997,3530.74," I don't know what I was gonna say well, well to go into I do want to say that I think this is like an absolutely unique game"
3530.74,3538.82, And I'm I'm glad that it exists because of its uniqueness and because I think outside of the specific circumstances that created it
3539.06,3542.74, Nothing like it would exist and that's like if you try to imagine any other studio
3543.34,3546.38, Proposing this game a game that in my experience
3546.38,3552.46," I don't know if anyone's got hard numbers, but I look at it in retrospect after having played it as being three-fourths non interactive"
3552.58,3556.54, And you'll see that the this ratio of gameplay to to movies changes
3557.18,3559.38, considerably after act three from act three forward
3559.38,3565.78, And I can't imagine anyone else getting the green light or you know having the budget or if someone did
3565.9,3571.3, It being a studio with the budget to produce the quality of cutscenes that are in this game
3571.46,3574.58, That doesn't mean that this is a remarkable game to me
3574.58,3578.34," It doesn't mean it's I think it's a great game ever, but I think I want to get that out there"
3578.34,3580.34, I'm thankful that
3580.42,3582.42, Someone is able to
3582.42,3586.1800000000003, pursue this kind of game if that's the one that they want to make but because of that
3586.1800000000003,3587.46, I don't look at it
3587.46,3596.02, I'll a lot of people have been saying it like this is the one that changes everything. This is the one that you know in the same way that all these other games changed the gaming landscape and you know
3596.02,3599.42, Whatever other clichÃ©s we're seeing I don't see this is that kind of game
3599.42,3604.42, I see maybe people cherry picking specific ideas and this goes along with my like larger reaction to it
3604.42,3606.42, It's being really uneven across the whole thing
3606.5,3613.7400000000002, But I don't imagine anyone it's it's going to spawn a billion copycats in the way that like GTA did or something
3613.7400000000002,3617.46," All right, and that doesn't mean it's bad. It's just like I said practical and and"
3618.38,3623.94," For different reasons, but the game for me is like uneven is the best way to describe it where there are flashes of like"
3624.34,3630.94," Like just brilliant moments, you know and never jealous and then they are things that I find are just like"
3631.94,3633.2200000000003," Torturing you know, it's a"
3633.22,3635.22," Yep, I just unbearable at parts"
3635.22,3640.54, I found that in every single metal your game. This is to me. This is like no exception to that particular reaction
3640.9399999999996,3644.8199999999997," Like I've always felt that not to about one and barely played three, but"
3645.9399999999996,3649.4199999999996," Yeah, and I think that like a lot of when you see like the most"
3650.02,3652.58, Uniformly positive responses to the game
3652.58,3658.58, I think it has to do with just the reactions to the to the movie part of it to the non interactive part of it
3658.58,3661.74, Because when you watch it and you get the sense and when I keep remembering it now
3661.74,3668.1," Remembering the the coolest things about it. It's like yeah, this was all stuff in the movies and because of the way that a movie"
3668.1,3672.4199999999996, That medium is able to you know play on your emotions and all this stuff like
3672.9399999999996,3677.3799999999997," It gives it that much of an extra lead and if you're thinking well, why is that a problem?"
3677.3799999999997,3679.7799999999997, It if that's what movies do well. They're in the game
3680.1,3684.3999999999996, My big thing with the game is now I want to ask you guys this is like I think ultimately
3684.3999999999996,3690.24, I came to conclude that the game play to track it from the cut from the movie and the movie
3690.3599999999997,3696.04, Detracted from from the game with with a few notable exceptions though on a game to but it's like either or
3696.3599999999997,3701.04, You know like I mean one example to clarify would be if you're if you're watching a long cut scene and and you know
3701.04,3704.54, You see the get-goes and they're doing all these crazy things there
3704.54,3708.72, You seem like a remarkable type of enemy and then when you actually play it
3709.2799999999997,3714.9799999999996, What you then see is that well can do a spin kick or it can do a few of these like really readily identifiable
3714.9799999999996,3718.64, You know maneuvers that it's limited to and if I had gone in without
3719.16,3725.1, Any expectation of what they could possibly potentially do and it wasn't demonstrated to me in this like it's stunning movie
3725.1,3729.48, I would probably be a lot more impressed. Wow. That thing just did a spin kick on your talking
3729.48,3736.48, You're talking about a set of like it's doing the same fucking kick over an overlooking about a scene that really frustrated me because I
3736.48,3738.48, You're talking about when you see
3739.3599999999997,3742.48," Right in fighting them with the sword. Yeah, and it's like a 20 minute"
3743.04,3748.96, Bad-ass cutscene of him fighting. I'm sitting there. You will never do the whole time thinking I'd like to play this part
3748.96,3753.28, And it's not letting me and then after that cutscenes over you have what like
3753.76,3760.14, 20 seconds were snakes like all right run and then all you do is just run through some four stars and don't do anything else
3760.14,3766.72, You just get out of the way and then there's another 20 minute bad-ass fight you can't do and that's really it was that was frustrating me at that particular time
3766.72,3771.8, I'm not even being facetious when I say this but like I almost look at it as like another
3772.48,3777.68, Kind of category. It's like extended anime is what I think of you know when you have like extended DVDs or something
3777.68,3781.04, You can imagine like if when Empire strikes back came out
3781.28,3786.36," If instead of seeing the movie and then getting this game later you saw the movie, but then like right after the ad at scene"
3786.36,3789.0, Then you get to play the Atari 2600 Empire strikes back
3789.0,3791.44, You know you're the stoked theater and you're going side now
3791.72,3799.4, The comparison I want to I want to make is not that this game is of the quality of that the parts of this that are interactive or the quality of the 2600 game
3799.52,3801.52, With the disparity is no less
3801.8,3805.0, Real or pernawns because of it and it would be like
3806.12,3810.48, And it led me to the reverse notion of in the same way that I look at this game is like
3811.1600000000003,3814.92, They they approach gameplay in the way that most game designers approach cutscenes
3814.92,3821.84, It's like you use something to punctuate your your story or your gameplay in here. They use the game. It's punctuated and it's like
3823.4,3825.4," Yeah, losing that train"
3825.64,3826.92, But um
3826.92,3831.84," But I don't know I mean yeah, that I think that that was it was it was an issue for me the whole time"
3831.84,3836.32," Oh, here's where I'm going it got to the reverse point of of normally when I'm playing a game with a long-cut scene"
3836.32,3838.32, I start to think about
3838.32,3842.04, Should I just press start now and skip it not in metal gear but most really extended cutscene games?
3842.04,3847.6800000000003," Yeah, there are many times at metal gear when I wish that could press start and skip the game to just kind of carry on with the"
3847.6800000000003,3850.36," With the with the is that the movie. Yeah, you know"
3850.48,3852.48, It's weird because so far
3852.64,3856.86, To me the game itself and maybe this is just a phenomenon of the first of the game
3856.96,3864.48, But the game itself has been the entertaining part like I really had a lot of fun and the big open battlefield stuff
3865.04,3871.58, You know like it was it was really entertaining to me and when I get to like you know
3871.58,3877.28, All these all these scenes where their idea of storytelling is to find some like
3877.28,3882.6800000000003, Siphai technology and tell you every little minute detail about it
3882.6800000000003,3888.0800000000004, It's like it's like they're making the matrix and instead of making like a two hour long movie
3888.0800000000004,3894.52, They make a 20 hour long movie and they spend 90% of the time telling you exactly how technically the matrix works
3894.52,3900.28," You know, it's like power point pretty there's a tradition and anime with that with like ghost in the shell and stuff"
3900.28,3905.0, They got to the point of ghost in the shell too where it was there was nothing but footnotes on every page
3905.84,3909.68, You know telling you this is how this this cock a mami
3909.68,3918.4," You know, the matrix thing works, but one of the weird weird things about it is that I feel like metal gear goes about out of its way to present itself as an allegory"
3919.12,3923.0, You know that like this it's okay like don't get caught up in the Siphai stuff
3923.0,3926.86, We're really talking about the real world here. We're talking about private military contractors
3926.86,3933.52, We're talking about surveillance. We're talking about people watching you and controlling you but control and every time control or work
3933.52,3940.8, Economy comes up you can see the italics the italics in the script. Yeah because it it will be the war economy or yeah
3940.8,3945.6," under control, you know, and then not only will you have the weird thing where you begin the game with them with the monologue"
3945.6,3948.68, And then you spend the rest of the game hearing other people
3949.36,3958.1," Repute your monologue at you as you go, huh? Huh? Yeah, so be but every opportunity that's there to hammer those points in the game will take it"
3958.1,3961.6," You know, wait it almost assumes it maybe rightfully so assumes that"
3962.4,3967.3199999999997," It's audience is just not going to get it. Yeah, which is gonna let me someone tell you what layers like yeah"
3967.3199999999997,3971.4, When I do see things that I think are our flashes of brilliance
3971.4,3976.68, I always hit to the point where I wonder and it sometimes doesn't matter intentionality doesn't always matter
3976.68,3978.44, You could have you know
3978.44,3981.08, Wonderful patterns emerge in a book that that
3981.08,3986.44, Everyone in the world has convinced that the author sort of went along with after critics started pointing them out
3986.44,3988.48," Oh, yeah, I had that mind all along other times"
3988.48,3994.8, They were clearly there and I never really know and the reason I doubt myself is because when in every other occasion
3995.16,4001.88," The game goes out of its way to tell you. Oh, yeah, this is what we're about yeah when something that's genuinely subtle happens"
4001.88,4004.68, I'm like is this just a
4004.68,4006.2400000000002, point
4006.2400000000002,4009.96, One of these things to but I just didn't understand how they could be so
4010.48,4017.36, hammering it in your face that the game is is allegorical and metaphorical and and and and at the same time
4017.36,4022.6600000000003, Like spend most of their time like comic book dorking it out trying to give you the real
4022.96,4027.44," Science explanation for what's going on, you know like all the details that do not"
4028.0,4031.76, Matt do you also find that like giving by giving you those details?
4031.76,4037.7200000000003, It's encouraging you to push further and then what all it's ultimately counterproductive because then it leaves you take it apart
4037.7200000000003,4043.6400000000003," It's the bullshit there. Yeah, I feel that way. It's like if you just stop a lot of like a good sci-fi will do this"
4043.6400000000003,4044.92, it's very
4045.08,4054.2400000000002, aware of like its limits of of it's power of explanation like do not go too far in this like did Star Wars in the force versus Star Wars in the second
4054.2400000000002,4059.4," Virtue with middle Koreans and stuff. Yeah, and how a lot of us are like this is great as long as you know"
4059.4,4065.08," Where the mumbo jumbo boundary is and you stay well away from right, but then when you start to crudhen it and then you provide it"
4065.08,4069.96, What amounts to a half ass explanation of it you had been better off to if just not touched it at all
4069.96,4073.08," And I think like yeah, it tries to go so far into things that"
4075.28,4080.28, There's this other thing why want to spoil things for you all that all that all I just want to say that
4080.92,4086.0, Like I think the game has moments that are really mysterious that work really well
4086.12,4091.16, We are like what the fuck is this like the first time I ever saw the the egg thing
4091.6,4096.52, Where it's you know you just hear this like little girls voice just cooking eggs and you're like
4096.52,4099.36, I this is creeping me out. I don't even understand how works
4099.36,4103.6, I'm a switch the whole game was like that like it was just almost you know
4103.96,4111.46," Owning up to its nonsense. Well, yeah, that's how the game starts like the literally you press start and then you get those commercials of like David Hader and that weird"
4111.46,4113.06," Yeah, I was like it"
4113.06,4119.620000000001, Would you want us to be absolutely like it might I like some things by David Lynch and others
4119.620000000001,4125.92," I don't like and the ones I like like my home drive ultimately add up to something yeah, yeah, the same way that like"
4126.72,4131.360000000001, Like what what's the killer seven? You know the game that it's kind of like the game you're describing
4131.36,4134.5199999999995, Let's just celebrate the fact that nothing is ever going to make a lick a sense
4134.5199999999995,4139.839999999999," You know, yeah, and I found that ultimately disappointing because I would rather that the real trick is if you take"
4139.839999999999,4142.759999999999, What if you take something that seems just insane and batch it crazy?
4142.759999999999,4147.5599999999995, And then it turns out that you can convince a lot of people is not maybe that's what Kujima does here
4147.5599999999995,4152.42, I'm not one of the convinced but a lot of people are convinced that that is actually what's happening
4152.7,4154.7, taking seeming insanity and then
4155.16,4160.54, Make some sense out of it to me so far and even in two has just been in pure insanity with no
4161.36,4166.48, Payoff right and I do enjoy the moments like you know if you're having a fucking crazy dream
4166.48,4168.799999999999, There's gonna be these moments stand out as like whoa
4168.799999999999,4171.46," That was cool. Remember when that happened. Yeah, that's how this whole game"
4171.46,4177.28, You know and you know to felt the same way when the moments and the and the moments in that game that make no sense or the
4177.28,4181.92, moments when I like for some reason to be able to detach myself from the bad
4182.36,4185.679999999999, Dialogue writing and the and the sort of hit you over the head
4186.4,4190.48, You know bullet points like war economy and appreciate
4191.2,4193.759999999999, the style of the game like the the
4195.36,4201.379999999999, Cool like character design and and visual universe that the game has which is really interesting to me
4201.379999999999,4205.959999999999," Yeah, it's a solid way to keep the human characters look so good in that game"
4205.959999999999,4210.959999999999," And I don't even know if it's a technology thing, but like their faces or yeah like really like"
4210.959999999999,4216.839999999999, I buy it in a way that I don't buy a lot of games like realistic human faces
4216.84,4221.88, But it but then you get you know into these or you know how I love like a
4223.2,4230.400000000001, Was it dream in his like his monkey and like weird drinking like Narcissota and all that stuff
4230.400000000001,4234.4400000000005, You know there's a lot of like resting images in the game that are really fun
4234.4400000000005,4237.4800000000005, But then they go and ruin it by having so much exposition
4237.4800000000005,4241.76, It's like the guy desperately needs an editor to say you know cut this shit out
4241.76,4246.64," Yeah, you just have a way better and the flame there's also the old the the old version of it and art, you know"
4246.64,4253.68, And it's like it takes two people to create a masterpiece painting and one to paint it and the other to hit them over the head and knock them out when it's done
4254.76,4257.12, It's kind of like it's kind of like that with writing here
4257.12,4261.92, But I want to go back when you're talking about the way that it wants to explain everything like
4262.56,4266.76, Part of the bigger you know reaction to the game is that and then I
4267.12,4270.4800000000005, Hear people repeating this over and over again is that it ties everything up
4270.92,4276.400000000001, So perfectly it puts just this to bow on everything and at the end you feel absolutely satisfied
4276.52,4282.320000000001," But part of that is trying to kind of come and say well, you know all these things that you expected"
4282.76,4284.16, We're bullshit
4284.16,4287.84, They're not really as bad as you think and we got answers for them and one example
4287.84,4292.320000000001, We'll know we're in the spoiler zones that you got you know vamp is he really a vampire is you know mortal
4292.48,4296.4," Well, no, it's the nano tech that's keeping them alive. So you're like okay. That's cool"
4296.4,4302.0599999999995, But then they're like well what about liquid and the fact that the
4302.0599999999995,4307.04, Oslo that he's been taken over by a by liquid by the fact that he had an arm transplant
4307.04,4309.44, That's not seem absurd that that someone's
4310.92,4315.5199999999995, Especially if you're like me and you don't believe in you know the ghost without the shell that there's no
4316.08,4319.32, Without the brain and it's functioning. There's no mind
4319.32,4324.36, So it's like the consciousness come from the jeans and this fools arm and they go no that was another trick
4325.88,4334.04, Because what really happened is that Oslo hypnotized himself into thinking he was liquid is in so the problem there for me
4334.04,4337.28," It's like well, that's just about as fucking ridiculous"
4338.28,4343.0199999999995," Yeah, why is that better and then so they do that and then in another case with of"
4343.26,4349.3, Being uneven and backfiring is that then there's a character and I won't spoil this for you guys because I do think it's cool
4349.3,4354.360000000001, But there's a return of a certain character and it basically amounts to a ghost without a shell that goes around
4354.360000000001,4357.700000000001, And in this case is gone around the world it just possess someone else or something
4357.700000000001,4363.3," So it's like that's fine, but the kind of consistency it's like I could totally accept that this is a world with ghosts"
4363.900000000001,4365.900000000001, But it makes me
4366.06,4371.580000000001, Not appreciated when you've gone to such other efforts to say that there are prosaic and realistic
4372.0599999999995,4373.9, You know non supernatural
4373.9,4379.14, Explanations for everything and you go out of your way to do that and make people happy with it
4379.14,4383.18," But then the same people don't seem to notice or give a shit about the other things, you know"
4383.18,4391.18," Yeah, although I mean they're just using like fake technology to to make make a different kind of like you know"
4392.9,4394.9, Extra real
4394.9,4395.9, You know
4395.9,4399.0599999999995," mythological thing, you know, it's it's like they are but it's"
4399.0599999999995,4403.82," To stick with too light though, I mean you chew in the head. I mean it might as well be it's might as well"
4403.82,4408.7, But I think there's a difference there and that's just because like it's consistent with the world and where it's like everything
4408.7,4416.54, It's leading you to everything has to do with nanotech and that is sort of the logical conclusion to come to within the within the the way that that world works
4416.86,4421.42, But it's not for the other things. It's not for self hypnosis and it's not for for
4422.299999999999,4423.98, Spirits and and the other southern
4424.94,4429.78," But yeah, I totally see point in the scheme of things. Yeah, it's like made a chlorine and force right?"
4429.78,4434.74," They basically said that vamp has got metacorion's not the force or yeah, yeah, yeah kind of like that"
4435.74,4442.94," Technology is magic. Yeah, I remember there was parts of that even in two because like there was that girl in part two that could like"
4443.7,4450.0599999999995, Make bullets go around for something like that and then they like know we took that away from you and then she's still able to do it or something like that
4450.0599999999995,4453.86," After they take it away from her. Yeah, see there's an example of like fortune to me"
4453.86,4458.5, Was like the thing that I remember most clearly about metal gear salad too because
4459.0599999999995,4463.7, That battle and all of her cutscene just to me to stuck out is like not that
4464.86,4469.42, By itself taking out of the even the context of all that's going on just a cool cool thing
4469.42,4473.98, And like I kind of feel the same way about even two a lesser degree like the beauty in the beast squad
4473.98,4477.94," Yeah, would you see them you're like that super cool? Yeah, for all of us that grew up watching"
4477.94,4482.9, Voltron and stuff and I've actually compared the boss battles and here to like the robust fights at the end of any
4482.9,4487.46," Yeah, I feel that like that's cool that looks awesome the design works really cool"
4487.46,4491.46," Yeah, and it's great to see them fight and stuff. I mean did you have fun playing it?"
4491.46,4495.62, Like I get the feeling that I might be the only person who is enjoying it was uneven like that
4495.62,4501.379999999999, I would go for moments of saking like this is totally fun to this like to actually screaming at my TV
4501.379999999999,4506.259999999999, Fuck you fuck this game. I'm not gonna do more and like I do want to get into that because we got to Pacific
4506.259999999999,4509.54, You say I'm full some shan is it like at the first part where you hit that stuff
4509.78,4514.18," You guys are gonna make me not want to play it, but that's fine because I think there's good let me give you something good first"
4514.18,4519.46," I want to say like well, I do think you could really break the game down and and atomize and say there's the game"
4520.18,4524.58, Dude just see me and if you guys are just gonna be looking at each other because this is boring as far as I'm
4524.58,4526.58, I'm not looking at him like it's foreign
4526.98,4528.98, All right
4530.98,4535.46," You fight no, it's nothing like that, but it's like I mean if it is I understand if you if you don't want to spoil the"
4535.46,4540.34, And it's boring and we decided before we can't do this that we're gonna spoil it then it's like if instead of
4540.9800000000005,4542.9800000000005, Being bumming and just
4542.9800000000005,4544.34, Don't bump
4544.34,4545.62, That's bum out
4545.62,4550.74," Go on if you're reading into it going awkward moments. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah"
4551.86,4556.66, So like I think you could separate a lot of the gameplay from the movies and and they'll do fine and
4556.66,4562.66," Either well the movie would do do better off on its own in some cases, but a few moments where they really come together"
4563.62,4568.82, Or like with a few themes they really come together and works well one is just like with the age and like
4569.0599999999995,4574.58, Absoleteness like it's just a steam that goes through the whole thing right. I mean your snake is this living relic and
4574.9,4581.86, It right from the very beginning to establishing that this new breed of soldiers has got another generation of nanotack and it's oppresses there
4581.86,4582.82, You know
4582.82,4589.78, They're shell shock and their ability to feel remorse and all these things and and he's kind of like bitter about it and it's like what you know
4590.099999999999,4592.98, You had to fight in my day for this you had to acquire
4593.46,4598.34, Tactics through you know you had to basically survive battle in order to get this and it sets this cool thing up
4598.34,4603.219999999999, And so first I was like well I wish they'd do something more with this by have like it kind of
4603.219999999999,4605.219999999999, It's it's the perfect set of for him to
4605.46,4611.62," To get together with the militia and you actually do in the gameplay, but it really it never puts a face or or anything or motive"
4611.94,4617.219999999999, Or even gives a voice to individual militia members at any point and I thought that was weird because that you know
4617.22,4621.780000000001, When the when beauty and the beast first come in and there's this long scene and they just kill like 20 militia guys
4621.780000000001,4625.46, And they want to ends I just see all their guns flashing on the ground and I was like hot damn
4626.26,4628.26, They're just pulled like the casino leverage
4628.820000000001,4636.3," And but later on though, I think it does really cool things with it and it like it what it does is like it leverages the the longevity of the series"
4637.06,4641.22, To what I say to make us feel old as players to parallel it
4641.3,4646.66, So because I look at like snakes premature aging is kind of like this metaphor for like the the right that video game
4646.66,4652.98, Technology ages so like five years which is the time between the sequel or something in the generation is actually a long time
4652.98,4658.58, And so now what I have to do is give you some evidence that this isn't just me making shit up and like in X4
4658.58,4664.9, It starts off with the quick little it actually loads up an emulation of the game that Jeff is playing
4665.3,4668.82, Of metal gear solid and when you play a section of that
4669.62,4675.139999999999, What it does is it's not only him it it's there for snake to be remembering his own past
4675.3,4679.9400000000005, But then it makes you remember your past with the game and also makes you aware of the extent to which you age
4679.9400000000005,4683.62, But causes like dude did this look this look this bad back then
4684.18,4688.9800000000005, This much time transpired wasn't this calmer some and awkward to control you know
4689.54,4694.660000000001, And so that whole act really starts to develop it now like this is gonna
4695.14,4700.740000000001, Start to really spoil but then the next phase would be you're walking around you you return to shadow Moses
4700.820000000001,4702.820000000001, Which is the setting of the first game and
4703.299999999999,4705.299999999999, After that
4705.299999999999,4711.219999999999, That real quick replay of the original scene you're in a new rendering of it. You're walking around and it's and it's exactly the same
4711.219999999999,4715.0599999999995," But all updated you look and you remember after you've just seen it, you know"
4715.46,4721.94, The old camera positions and stuff and then they like there's a part where you walk in a room where you used to go to get a like a perk or something
4721.94,4728.0199999999995, And then the camera pants to the camera on the wall. It's a security camera and it rusts and it falls off and falls down
4728.580000000001,4729.540000000001, And
4729.540000000001,4732.900000000001, That is super cool because then what happens is in this new version of it
4733.38,4734.660000000001, You're you have
4734.660000000001,4741.700000000001, Alternatives you have stand-ins for cameras and stuff you have these mobile and droids and stuff you have the get-goes that are actually acting as turrets now
4742.02,4747.46, In this reiteration of it. You have the fact that the camera for the game has changed itself the way that your
4747.780000000001,4749.780000000001, Camera you're controlling is radically different
4749.860000000001,4755.22, So it starts to pile on this sort of thing without being heavy handed and that's where I came back to the point where is this just
4756.18,4762.42, Something that's steam roll ended up supporting its own thing but then more evidence that they know what they're doing is that
4763.14,4766.900000000001, You ultimately go down you fight through the same levels. It's it's it's constantly
4767.46,4773.14, Revising what you've experienced the battle with sniper wolf is is updated and it's a battle against
4774.58,4779.62, Crime wolf who's also like a sniper type thing but instead of like associating herself with a wolf
4779.62,4782.900000000001," She's actually like a robotic wolf, you know, and then you go in you fight"
4783.7,4787.139999999999, You actually get down to where the metal gear Rex was that you do that you
4787.7,4792.98," Fight in the in the first game and it is kind of like snake. It's now obsolete technology, you know"
4792.98,4798.099999999999, It's this old thing that was the big threat of the game before but out subsequent metal gears came out
4798.099999999999,4803.86, There were new metal gears and this is just this old relic there and you end up getting in it and fighting in it and fighting your way out
4804.179999999999,4809.94, And you're specifically you fight your way out the same route where you were in a Jeep before and you get out and just little things like that
4810.0199999999995,4815.299999999999, It's like this is cool. It's taking the old bad enemy and it's putting you in charge of it as the old bad dude and
4816.66,4820.58," And then it's sort of like dies down after that, but I think all of that is like a really"
4821.0599999999995,4826.98," Yeah, really good pairing of gameplay and you know the theme and the movie and the gameplay all that coming together really well"
4827.62,4830.66, Then you have the moments like an act three where
4831.62,4833.62, Get Ava saying
4833.62,4836.82, all of these these children remind these PMC rebels
4837.219999999999,4844.0199999999995, You just to play FPS games and that detached them from reality and now that's why they fight and they don't have any
4844.0199999999995,4846.9, I like seriously when she said that I was like
4847.7,4852.74, You're fucking kidding me easy about to make an FPS games or ruining youth speech in metal gear solid for
4853.46,4855.46, After trying to emulate FPSs
4856.74,4861.139999999999," So there's no ham-handed moments. Yeah, you're just like maybe he isn't being subtle"
4861.54,4865.86," That plays it off with it. Yeah, yeah, maybe he like because that was like the least subtle"
4865.94,4871.7, I was like the most laugh-out moment of mouth laugh-out love moment of the whole game so far and this came after like 45 minutes
4873.38,4878.82, Exposition of like you know biblical exposition of this person to get this person and then this person
4878.82,4882.74, This person and then they had a twin and then the twin had two twin and then they're
4882.98,4884.66, And a mingled and became second
4884.66,4890.9," That's also interesting to you. I mean, dude. No that part I was ready to just like okay shut up and can you skip the shit at all?"
4890.9,4893.46," Okay, you can you have to like you have a whole thing"
4893.46,4898.66," Yeah, yeah, yeah, just fast forward. Oh, you can right. Yeah, you don't know that it's not going anywhere that you don't care"
4898.66,4901.06, I mean my problem with this specifically is that I
4901.7,4908.5, Don't retain plot details of metal gear games the way some people do. I mean the people who love this shit are the people who remember
4908.9,4914.18, Every school all these people are and I just didn't go on. I don't remember any of this crap right that's the deal for me when I watch it
4914.18,4916.18, I felt that it that it just is like
4917.06,4923.14, You know back to the whole thing with hitting the artists over the head when to stop it fucks up its own it fucks itself up because it will
4923.22,4929.9400000000005, Have a number of cool concepts and scenarios and threats and you're like if this if you were to make it just a movie of this if this was just like CG
4929.9400000000005,4932.740000000001, You know anime movie or something and if they stopped here
4933.3,4937.38," Like this is cool. I like it. I mean, I'm not gonna compare it to like the great stuff ever"
4937.38,4941.3," But it would be a good it would be a pretty badass, you know like and anime and"
4941.860000000001,4946.26, But then they just keep going and they get to the parts where you're talking about where you find out that
4946.26,4949.22, I don't even know if I should spoil but at the very end there's just some real
4949.7,4956.58," Namasko shit, you know, and it's like well if you would just not done that if you would have been satisfied that you had"
4957.06,4962.5, Enough to thrill people with and enough to keep people thinking with without having who's sorry
4962.5,4965.14, It might be me without having to you know
4965.780000000001,4967.780000000001, Go that far it would have been better off
4968.34,4974.34," Yeah, and I'm ultimately frustrated by what they choose to show you in cutscenes that looks like it'd be cool to play"
4974.42,4979.38, Or so what you actually play because then again in act 3 and I think you probably about to get here. I don't know sure already did it
4979.7,4981.7, there's this scene
4982.26,4989.46, Where you're sneaking around is a civilian following this resistance person and it's the most long
4989.7,4994.74, protracted horrible sequence in the whole game as far as I'm concerned and it's like it's half hour
4995.22,4997.22, I've just following a guy around and
4997.9400000000005,5001.7, It's just not fun. Is it personality like you get caught easy?
5002.26,5008.5, It's not it's more like his reactions and just don't make any sense sometimes it's frustrating
5009.139999999999,5014.099999999999," And super long it's longer than it should be I think yeah, there was nothing interesting happened the whole time I did it"
5014.099999999999,5018.98, I was expecting some sort of like okay this part's gonna be tricky because something's gonna show up and like out of con
5019.7,5022.98, Manchins like oh there's a helicopter now and then I never saw a helicopter
5023.7,5030.5, Like the question like for the phone light and I'm like what's for me that was a good conceptually like this is a great way to change the pace
5030.58,5034.58, Because an axe wanted to you go from the war zone stuff and you go from the big you know
5034.98,5042.98, On rails battle at the end and and the big high high action cut scenes to like something that's subdued like a quiet night in Eastern Europe
5043.3,5047.86, And you're gonna be stalking someone but it's definitely like it's designed is if you basically take a
5048.5,5053.22, city a rudimentary city and you make it as a big you know maze and you have to find
5054.18,5060.02, Guy who's an an informer for this resistance and you basically then have to stalk him and find get him to
5060.26,5061.780000000001, You fall into the safe house
5062.02,5065.540000000001, But this is easier said and done it takes a long time. I mean where you'll you'll you'll
5066.18,5071.3, Trace them you know you'll you'll track him and then you'll hit a load screen as you're going into another part of the town
5071.540000000001,5076.1," Yeah, and then you'll just continue to do that and then it starts to to complicated by saying that well"
5076.9800000000005,5083.3, He can't get arrested and he's gonna or he'll actually stop and wait if you if there are like PMCs in the area
5083.3,5085.3, So you have to take out the PMCs
5085.3,5092.26, So then I my case around in this problem of like he'll you take out the PMCs that that are arresting them and then he tries to kill you
5092.74,5098.1, And you're like everyone else in the game understood right away that I was like their buddy if I took out the PMCs
5098.42,5100.900000000001," And that wasn't so bad, but then he would immediately run back"
5100.900000000001,5104.18, He would he would book it somewhere else and it would like restart the whole thing
5104.26,5109.3, So then you go back behind him and follow him through it again and and my case something would always go wrong
5109.62,5112.9800000000005, Where he would see me and freak out and he would do it over and over again
5112.98,5116.9, And I got to that was one of those points where I wish like a press start and skip it as I don't need to know
5117.139999999999,5120.74, The movie's gonna fill me in on what happens next. I don't physically need to do that
5120.74,5123.299999999999, It's not even what me why not you know
5123.299999999999,5125.299999999999, I'm ready for that game
5125.299999999999,5128.98, Seriously like you should just be able to skip it
5128.98,5132.98," Well, by the fucking game you should be able to skip actually, you know on the dark"
5132.98,5134.66," Well, yeah, I do what I'd arc what you do"
5134.66,5140.9," I'm happy ready for that. Yeah, so how long would it be if you just kept skipping every single if you just like I don't care"
5141.219999999999,5144.099999999999," I can't about the cut still would be over 10 hours long. Yeah, yeah"
5145.379999999999,5148.099999999999, Three is so uneven too because after that after
5148.66,5155.0599999999995, I basically remember that is that miserable section we just described a ton of cut scenes and then the next one is absolutely on rails
5155.0599999999995,5159.379999999999, Like time crisis without a like gun with a controller looks really nice looks fantastic
5159.379999999999,5165.0599999999995, But it's it's absolutely like immaterial. It's like you can't die. There's no it you just you know Sean you tested it right
5165.0599999999995,5169.62," You just yeah, I was it's it's literally you're like on a motorcycle like on the back of cement"
5169.62,5178.42," Also's motorcycling and controlling the motorcycle just shooting, you know the targets as they pop out and if you and I noticed that I was it was going so fast and again"
5178.42,5182.26, It looks incredible. I call that the gulf cycle by the way the gulf cycle
5184.099999999999,5186.099999999999, The grandma like the fuck cycle
5187.46,5191.0599999999995, Not really I because I heard but just because it's like an old chick with like a
5191.7,5193.3," Yeah, you're on the back of a bike"
5193.94,5198.98, One particular fade from a picture to her that's just particularly disturbing and on from that one
5198.98,5204.9, But anyway your on this motor around the back of this motorcycle and you know all the the cacos are jumping out and you know different
5205.219999999999,5207.0599999999995, Military guys are shooting for me and it looks
5207.62,5212.74, Unreally good like I think this is probably like the moment where I might I had the jaw drop moment
5212.74,5218.0199999999995, Like wow this looks like a quite great city and like the action here is just so well choreographed
5218.0199999999995,5225.459999999999, But it is just like you know moving your gun target over the things that they as they pop out and then yeah you get down one out of ten
5226.42,5231.38, And you don't feel any threat when you stop shooting and like you're not really gonna die and then you load in the next area
5231.38,5235.38," And like I could have probably not really shot any of the yeah, I was just gonna say could you just have sat there?"
5235.38,5240.58, It's more of like it's like a fact that's a few exceptions. I think you probably take to keep it from from looping maybe
5240.58,5242.02," Yeah, probably have to kill some of the girls"
5242.02,5246.26, What you're saying is it just didn't feel like that I was in that much peril to hold times
5246.26,5251.62, It was like an interactive cutscene and all that's as I say it's almost like the things that you were saying before that we're like bad
5251.62,5256.9, Things you wish you could have played like this is something that totally could have just been a cutscene that could have just been a cutscene
5256.9,5260.9, But there's also that I got to play it. I guess if I had had been a cutscene
5260.9,5264.82," I probably would have been complaining that I couldn't have played that yeah, but you know"
5265.3,5267.3, Maybe make it a little more challenging
5267.3,5270.66, before that like I would have talked with the action in act two
5271.22,5274.66, Because I think it's another example and like this is where we're all that you know
5274.66,5277.46, It's another example of how the games on even because
5278.34,5282.9800000000005, It's almost like it'll it'll suggest an idea and never develop it or follow through on it
5282.9800000000005,5285.62, So like for you saying but as an example when you're on top of
5286.26,5287.62, Dread and Striker
5287.62,5289.62, Which is you know is vehicle and
5289.62,5295.22, The guys are acting like zombies and coming after you like oh this could be cool. What if there's this entire level
5296.02,5301.62, Is basically like resin evil five or something and they really did it where you're you're running from these guys
5301.62,5305.06, It changes the pace of it. It's not stealth and you're dealing with bensteads just like a
5305.54,5310.34, Here's just like a little after dinner. May here's something if we had more if we really wanted to do something with it
5310.34,5315.3, Maybe we could have but it's just like just enough to make you wish they had and then the rest of it's an on-rails
5315.54,5319.860000000001," Point your gun whatever comes comes around the corner, you know as you're on our on our"
5320.42,5327.38," Enjoy ride. Yeah, that's going to disappoint me. Well, there's there's this like line of stuff going through the game that I feel like is intentionally"
5328.580000000001,5331.06, video gamey like intentionally
5331.620000000001,5340.26, Limited intentionally sort of old school like in the and they keep on bringing these things up almost and that way that he likes to like break the
5340.42,5346.160000000001," Potension by reminding you that that this is just a silly video game. Yeah, I've yeah"
5346.160000000001,5350.42," entertain the the thought too that like you know it's like well, how to see like outdatedness and obviously"
5350.42,5356.740000000001, It says a theme. It's like the theme that the game itself is a living relic right that it's like it exemplifies
5357.780000000001,5360.820000000001, It's like the last gasp of an old way of making games
5361.06,5365.700000000001," Even though I don't really think that I mean, I was just like it's something I entertain but because there are some parts like you're saying there's so"
5365.860000000001,5370.34, Ruedo-Mentry and they're so gamey and they're so like a lot of people reacted that way to the scene
5370.34,5373.46, We were talking about I see a bunch of people calling it last gen and
5373.780000000001,5378.18," It's like well, I was like another zap part of the point there and if it there's another thing at the end"
5378.740000000001,5382.660000000001, That they they would lead you to believe that and it's like when you get a fight with with liquid
5382.660000000001,5386.26, It switches like the health bars kind of appear on the screen and you're like oh shit
5386.26,5390.02, It's going to do a past issue of a fighting game and it does
5390.5,5395.9400000000005," With then you're like okay, this is a great joke. It should just be a sight gag and it should be really quick right, but then it becomes a grueling"
5396.580000000001,5402.740000000001, fight with the shitty version of the shitty makeshift version of you know of a fighting game interface and
5402.900000000001,5404.580000000001, Guys with multiple health bars
5404.660000000001,5407.46, So you're doing it and I died like five times on it
5407.46,5410.740000000001," So if you go ahead and send your mail him a pussy, but I died five times on that and"
5411.46,5414.34, I'll get him down to like the last health bar something and it's like dude
5414.34,5418.580000000001, It's I went from smiling and think it this is a rad joke to hating to wanting to skip it again
5418.66,5423.62, It's like I can't it's any other I said another another you know video gamey thing
5423.62,5427.46, I mean the big authentic old school video game experience
5427.46,5432.18," You should screw really hard. Yeah, I mean there's there's definitely like"
5433.86,5438.98," Partishingly cheap, but there are a lot of things about the game that that it just like that"
5438.98,5445.14, I'm sort of impressed by the fact that they're willing to keep that stuff like it's it's just straight up
5445.38,5449.06," Obviously, you know a few people's idea of a good time"
5449.62,5452.18, Not like you know a focus group
5452.740000000001,5454.58, tightly made like
5454.58,5460.26," thrill ride roller coaster Call of Duty 4, you know like all fun all the time"
5460.5,5463.62," Yeah, same but you will definitely get the sense that this is yeah"
5463.62,5467.3, Could you name his game through and through this totally an author game and that yeah
5467.3,5472.740000000001, That goes back to I go to say what's I'm glad that that potential exists because most people could not make that kind of game
5472.82,5479.7, At least with the budget that this will yeah as like most is like show one yes three product that everyone has been waiting for it would be awesome though
5479.7,5487.7," You know a game like that came out and it really did just blow you away like I that's just doesn't happen. No, you know"
5488.74,5494.34," I mean it's it's a nice game. It's cool, but I've always like waiting for that game that's gonna come out"
5494.34,5500.66," I know where and be like holy shit that we really feel really master piece. Yeah, but that isn't like losing your fucking"
5500.98,5504.74, Sense of proportion yeah to say to say that about you know
5504.98,5510.26, Like I this think about is like if if there is enough I mean like to go back to because I know people
5510.26,5515.62, I think people will probably have fun like looking at that that obviously less and Steven see other things and it kind of like
5515.78,5518.98, Let's you look at them differently and get something else out of them. So one example
5518.98,5522.66, Everyone was posting this video of when when autocons saying like
5523.22,5525.94, Since I need you to insert this to now snake and
5526.419999999999,5531.379999999999, Everyone's like look they're making fun of Xbox 360 like this is could you be saying it fuck you?
5531.379999999999,5536.98," You know because this all talk about proxy orders all the game is nothing but a proxy war for fucking fanboys, you know"
5538.98,5545.219999999999, And so they're like this is making fun of that but instead it was making it is it fits into the steam of like
5545.7,5550.9, This is when you know this is the way that you remember it here's another way of saying times have changed and like you know
5550.9,5554.259999999999, In the way of saying this snake has changed and stuff and like that fit in with that
5554.259999999999,5556.259999999999, There's this other theme of control
5556.259999999999,5562.82," Which of course, you know, they keep saying and I think there is more room for that to of like fit in with the actual gameplay"
5563.139999999999,5565.139999999999, They do with the boss
5565.78,5571.7, Screaming mantis which is not it shouldn't be a surprise or much of a spoiler because it's a marionette artist right
5571.7,5575.86," Yeah, it's first the enemy. It's you know the puppeteer and like the original original"
5575.86,5581.0599999999995," Antis like it is you had to change your controller for right. Yeah, which is one of the coolest"
5581.78,5584.5, Moments in a game for me that gave me that was awesome
5585.299999999999,5588.5, So like there's it does definitely hit hit on that theme there
5588.9,5593.94, And it's actually the weapon you when you when you beat that boss you get a weapon and it's like the voodoo doll
5594.339999999999,5598.58, Which you're supposed to be able to like you shoot someone with it and then you're able to control them it's
5599.139999999999,5603.86, There's no one else to fight after that point that it will work on so it's kind of like I was like oh shit
5603.94,5605.86, Maybe I can use it on the second playthrough
5606.42,5608.58, To my knowledge I can't yet so I don't know
5609.299999999999,5611.219999999999, But that I was thinking it would have been
5611.86,5620.58, It's another area where they could have like had had so much fun with control right because I mean we're snakes poppeteers on the other end and it's like if there were to been some moment where
5621.62,5625.86, I mean I'm not saying this because I think I'm a games iron something but it is just like what comes to mind
5625.86,5630.86, It could have been funny if you do something bonehead it was snake and he's just like autocon I don't know why I just did this
5631.42,5632.42, Stupid
5632.5,5634.5, Why did I do that
5634.5,5642.02," It was like if there's there's like ton of potential there. Yeah, that's one where I'm still I'm not convincing that category that that fully does allow it"
5642.9800000000005,5644.9800000000005, the the last
5645.22,5650.1," No, kind of I think x5 kind of goes back to me. You told to where I what I felt about act 3"
5651.86,5656.66," But overall that's just it. Yeah, it's like it's hard to say people want you to to love or hate something and it's it's me"
5656.66,5661.46," Wait, I'm glad I like it. I like it. I'm glad it's out, but it's like there's so much of it that I think"
5662.099999999999,5666.42, Is either annoying or or just absurd and it could have been better and then but for every one of those
5666.42,5673.38," There's something I think so also. Yeah, I mean the unevenness of it is kind of a drive to because you know that if this particular thing sucks that you know"
5673.38,5675.22, But around the corner there could be something
5675.46,5683.22," Fucking awesome because that's how these game works. Yeah, that's why he keep playing too. Yeah because it does it does establish that anything can happen"
5683.7,5689.06," So it's like let's just see what what else does happen. Yeah, even then like that like tracking sequence"
5689.06,5691.22, I'm lucky to do that where you're like looking at the ground with your night vision
5691.22,5694.18," Yeah, I mean the footprints like if you took a little like a wrong turn"
5694.26,5699.26," Did you end up in the crop circle did I yeah, did I take that wrong turn every wrong"
5699.66,5704.02," Yeah, I think it did every section of that entire map. I swear to God"
5704.02,5709.820000000001, I never really figured out really I never figured out what what made her footprints different from the other
5709.9,5715.259999999999," I think they're pretty easy. Yeah, I don't know so I I chalked it up to standard definitely not"
5715.74,5720.219999999999, Telling me the difference like to me it was very clear triangular heel print
5722.219999999999,5724.219999999999, Are you just like some sort of awesome tracker
5724.94,5730.62," Like look it's obvious that she was wearing high heels, man. I mean just looked down there in the dirt and I was actually"
5730.62,5731.98, I mean when
5731.98,5735.42, Riden called to say like because at one point those disappear
5735.42,5738.7," Yeah, and then I was like oh shit they disappeared know what and I was upset that"
5739.02,5741.02, Riden called before I could figure out that
5742.46,5746.3, That she had been picked up and now there is heavier like darker footprints
5746.62,5749.9800000000005, That you can track because they're deeper. I didn't get that at all somehow
5749.9800000000005,5752.86, I was upset that I was that that was told that section
5752.86,5756.3, That's really weird. It was disappointing for me because when it the setup was that
5756.9400000000005,5761.02," Okay, this is going to be an extraordinarily complex section"
5761.02,5763.74, We're really gonna like try something here and I was like oh God
5763.82,5766.46, This is like part two of the battle with the boss that end from
5767.66,5771.0199999999995, The sniper from metal your salt three and if you got the hammer not and it's saying
5771.34,5776.139999999999, You know it's telling you about wind and the people's ability to smell you and then so I was assuming
5776.139999999999,5780.86, Like this is I was like oh shit. This is the battle with the with crying wolf almost like
5780.94,5787.34, This is gonna be fucking red not only am I stalking trying to find where Naomi is but I have to avoid being stalked
5787.34,5793.26, But then you go through and there's nothing will stop you knew it all and it's actually like something like straight out of the original metal gear
5793.34,5795.26," Yeah, just in this like open wild environment"
5797.26,5801.66, Labrante of there's a honeycomb of like of trails and you go through there
5804.62,5811.02, What about like did it did everybody you like nitpicking shit when you were playing like the action levels and and they felt like
5811.34,5818.14," Okay, these guys are clearly more qualified to make a stealth game than an action game and so if I really wanted to"
5819.1,5821.1, To go all out play action and be like
5821.5,5826.860000000001, Then it this is fair to compare this to like other mediocre shooter games and stuff a lot of like third person ones
5826.860000000001,5830.860000000001, I might have played like you know shell shock name or something and it kind of was reminded me of that with like
5830.860000000001,5833.26, I mean it's got the old problem of infinite spawns guys
5833.26,5838.660000000001, They're materializing out of walls and you could hit them with the mortar for 20 minutes and I mean there are times
5838.660000000001,5843.5, It was a way to get a bunch of points if you want I mean you're simultaneously raising the price of items
5843.82,5847.94, But I think I was outpacing it because of the broad number of guys I killed right like a fucking
5847.94,5851.1, Charnal house in this whole alley because they kept just coming to the spot
5851.1,5856.7," Yeah, the three guys is constantly trying to take the positions and yeah, so sometimes little things like that would annoy me"
5856.7,5863.74, And I found I found the actual mechanics of fighting to be pretty satisfying sometimes like in close quarters
5863.74,5866.78, Like a lot of third person shooters it felt like
5867.42,5873.46," Like I would fight to get my aim around so that was a little awkward, but like if as long as they were, you know"
5873.5,5879.9," Ten feet away. It was a pretty satisfying third person shooter. Yeah, I don't understand the point of first person view"
5879.9,5883.3, They stick that gun like right in the middle of your tossing
5883.3,5886.5," Yeah, like how could that possibly the third you have a laser"
5886.5,5890.54," So you outside of snipers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the sniper rifle is another thing entirely"
5890.54,5894.5, But why you would ever want to block your entire screen with this weapon model?
5895.94,5901.26," Right. Yeah, it's scary. Then there's like I'd let it go as like this wouldn't be you know"
5901.26,5907.58," Anything a truly disturbing me, but it was kind of funny. We were pointing out where you'll be in the middle of this pitched battle with the"
5908.14,5914.22, Rebels fighting on your side and you're taking down the PMC's new shoot one guy and it's like it's a tough to exclamation above his head
5914.22,5917.1, And right suddenly everyone in the battlefield just wants to fight you
5917.26,5921.780000000001, You know the alarm counters going off you're like what the fuck yeah orders and machine guns and grenades
5922.1,5924.62, We're enough like it had it I had to you know
5924.62,5934.86," No, I'm in the beach and I think the most fun I had in the war environment was the the where you're sort of like"
5934.86,5939.98, Rating that villa toward the end of like the all-out war section where you can take
5939.98,5943.66, I took this path like up into the mountains where the snipers were hanging out up there
5943.66,5948.98, And I just like picked those guys off one by one and then you get to the edge of the cliff and you come up to one of those mortar stands
5948.98,5951.78, I didn't know to bum barred all the guys in the villa all though
5951.78,5953.78, That was a huge trouble
5953.78,5955.78, That boss is making it less sad
5955.78,5965.58," It does because yeah, it's like it's I felt in those moments like you know if you were on like a Disneyland ride like parts of the Caribbean and then if the ride broke down"
5965.58,5970.66, And so while it would be super cool if you momentarily pass and see the dog trying to the the
5970.66,5974.9, Priser trying to get the keys from the dog then you're stuck there for 15 minutes watching the Priser
5974.9,5979.54," Trying to get the keys from the dog every Peter dialogue. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, they do repeat the dialogue"
5979.54,5984.3," Exactly way, you know like she and I was by both supposed to be moving and get this three times"
5984.3,5991.46, WD40 on this thing. It's weird because they give you so much feeling of like openness like you could attack this and various ways
5991.46,5997.14," Like this like it's really up to you this very it's on rails, but it's like why like so wide and you could really"
5997.14,6002.1, You know sneak in or you could mortar the hell out of people or you could use your sniper rifle or you could do you know
6002.1,6008.06," You could do a lot of things, but in the end you feel like you can't you don't have the control to like change the game world"
6008.18,6013.780000000001, Doesn't matter what you do it's it is just always gonna be like dudes pouring out of there
6013.9400000000005,6018.780000000001," Right and yeah, I've rebels pouring out behind you and that's never gonna change no matter what you do, you know"
6018.780000000001,6023.780000000001," Yeah, I even felt like the incentive for doing things differently was simply your own enjoyment"
6023.780000000001,6029.620000000001, Which is a good incentive in its own way. Sure. I did make the effort to like get into a building
6029.620000000001,6032.54, I was like oh why did they get in here? There's like an
6032.54,6037.58," An ammo clip, but I wasted five ammo clips getting you know getting in the place. So they're just never seemed like"
6037.94,6040.34," You never found something in those special places, right?"
6040.34,6046.46, That was worth he was there for kind of a hop-up song choice for me is like did anyone not help the rebels?
6047.1,6053.26," I always did it seems like counterproductive to because yeah when the game was described at first I was like oh, this is"
6053.9,6059.0199999999995, Kind of like going to the stalker scenarios where there's just a bunch of factions and they align with you based on your actions
6059.02,6064.780000000001, But really there's PMCs which will never align with you and they're the enemy and you just happen to be fighting alongside rebels
6064.780000000001,6070.06," And if you shoot one of them then they'll attack you, but if you don't they'll help you though like why would you"
6070.38,6074.18," Want to shoot them yeah, right? I mean, I don't understand why who would do that?"
6074.18,6077.5, I want them to have the hearts over their head and turn blue with you. Okay
6078.14,6083.580000000001," So that kind of seemed like a non mechanic to me. It really just yeah, I had really deflated to and I never really got the chance"
6083.580000000001,6088.22, I've never got the sense of when it was when I when I triggered it or not like sometimes if it's still looking me
6088.3,6090.3, Like
6091.740000000001,6096.860000000001, Can I ask you a question you know that that that area of the honeycomb outside where you're tracking
6096.860000000001,6101.02, There is a moment where you find like the woman's bra. Oh my god
6101.34,6104.38," Okay, and there's some really gross thing that happens because it's bacon"
6104.38,6108.62," Yeah, is that what happened because I shot that guy in the head yeah, he was circling like I"
6109.5,6113.66, Couldn't feel but the thing was you just you you're past that you pass this girl's bra
6113.66,6120.0599999999995, And right when you show up you see this guy in the corner like bent over with like hearts coming out of and I mean he was like bent over her
6120.78,6123.0199999999995," Oh god, and I shot him in the"
6124.7,6131.66," Do you want to put the playboy magazine sound yeah, I didn't even understand that though because I never thought she was wearing a bra"
6131.66,6133.66, Her cleavage
6133.66,6140.139999999999, She has like the craziest like you know sports illustrated swimsuit edition cleavage
6140.46,6146.38, You know for a woman in a in a research those those gags though and they're quite a few them in there
6146.38,6151.02, I think we're we're worked better in the game portion which is that being an example
6151.02,6155.820000000001, But when they were in the cutscenes they were pretty embarrassing like when Johnny Achibos like shooting him
6155.820000000001,6157.820000000001," Oh, oh"
6157.820000000001,6161.02, Why do you know why does it show his pant that was the disgusting thing?
6161.02,6166.46, There's like a moment where you're in battle and this guy is with you and he's literally shooting his pants during battle
6166.46,6168.46, You're shooting people and the skies of their going oh
6170.700000000001,6172.700000000001, No
6172.700000000001,6177.740000000001, Not exactly the cutscenes they keep on swinging around to show you that the back of his pants are all shitty
6178.46,6180.46, It's so gross
6180.46,6184.3, There's a point at first where it's like I thought the monkey the monkey's wearing a diaper
6184.54,6190.3, Then there's the when you acquire the barrel. There's a dude you're acquiring the guy was in there shooting underneath the barrel
6190.3,6193.820000000001, Johnny wasn't it's like this you should sound like it would be right up my alley
6194.78,6200.62," The off of like I have a double standard, but it worked it was better some animators had to spend time like rendering that"
6201.42,6203.42, That's what they do
6203.42,6205.42, It should stain bigger and the folio
6205.42,6208.7, People they're probably like we need about 20 minutes of
6209.74,6213.66," Yeah, she sounds like just you know like a churning bow"
6215.099999999999,6217.099999999999, Oh
6217.099999999999,6222.86," Just okay, that's great. Yeah, yeah for the nirgling wow that Johnny nirgled dude that's that guy's name"
6223.339999999999,6231.5," All right, are we getting kicked out? Oh, yeah, indeed, I mean this was not open invitation"
6231.9,6235.5, Maybe I'll cut off my arm and you can graft it onto one of you and then you can hypnotize
6235.5,6238.219999999999," I think I'm that's a maybe yeah, oh, yeah"
6239.0199999999995,6244.299999999999," Staying in the mirror and tell me what I get your wild character. Yes, oh cool. Yes, you would if you believed"
6244.7,6250.139999999999, I thought legendary threat is next if there's a zero there's always gonna be a born so thanks cut out to zero
6251.1,6258.14," And remember let's see I'm gone for three weeks, but the brodio show go on and"
6260.54,6262.54, Then the dolphin will be here
6263.900000000001,6269.42," Flipper will be taking my slippers the new host. All right, we're out everybody"
6271.42,6273.9800000000005," Don't go man, all right, I'm still here"
