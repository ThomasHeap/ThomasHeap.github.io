0.0,10.52," earlier this week on one up FM. And now, Anthony Gallagos on Yodel. So people that"
10.52,14.8," don't watch the episodes, like one and two that closely won't notice, but there is"
14.8,18.8," a lot of Star Wars. Yeah, yeah. When I say episodes one and two, there is nothing else."
18.8,22.88," You know what I mean? Like I would say this name of this thing first, but Star Wars"
22.88,28.12, needs no introduction to that. But there is a female equivalent of Yoda on the Jedi
28.12,32.52," Council. And last week on GFW, all the guys are cloning on her. And they told me"
32.52,35.72," I had to sign that that's what they're going to be doing, which is why I wasn't on the show."
35.72,41.0," And won't be on any future GFWs because like, I can't handle that they've just been like,"
41.0,44.92," like, they can cland on a lot of ship, but Star Wars, I take kind of personally. Especially when"
44.92,48.92," it comes to Yodel because one time I got some play from a Primordial Midget, Primordial Midget,"
48.92,53.32," it's a really, really tiny. And she was a cosplayers Yodel. At the New York Comic Con I went to."
53.32,57.32, So I take it kind of on a personal level. Especially because a lot of people don't know that Yodel's
57.32,62.76," like an extra special character, you know. She's she's she like worked with one of the head of the"
62.76,67.72, Jedi Council and then she suffered a century of imprisonment. This shit's on Wikipedia. It's all expanded
67.72,73.88," universe. And so after suffering a century of imprisonment, she was given a temporary seat on the"
73.88,78.44, Jedi Council. And then she went and fought after training some really hardcore Jedi Council members.
78.44,82.2," I mean like you know Jedi Knights, she ended up fighting on this planet just part of the Clone Wars"
82.2,86.44," and she sacrificed herself by absorbing a chemical weapon blast that would destroy the city,"
86.44,90.6, which Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan can Obi-Wan be where in. So she sacrificed herself saving
90.6,95.8," Obi-Wan and Anakin, making up set three possible. And you know, was then replaced by Shakti,"
95.8,100.03999999999999," who we all know if we all watch the Clone Wars cartoons, Shakti. Plus you know I was talking to"
100.03999999999999,104.28," Sean last night and it was just pissing me off because he was clowning on a Twilight, because I told"
104.28,108.92," him Twilight's are like the single most beautiful alien species. And he said that that's retarded,"
108.92,113.72, but it's a known fact like in Star Wars lore that Twilight's are just like the most gorgeous
113.8,117.08," Twilight's being the head tail's girls that you see in child is palestancing. But yeah,"
117.08,121.32, it all comes down to Yodel. There's been a lot of people after that GFW making some really nasty
121.32,125.48, photoshopps of Yodel milk and shit like that for Sean. And I just don't appreciate that. I take
125.48,130.84, it very personal. So the fuck GFW radio and I ain't going to be on that shit no more. You guys
130.84,139.0," don't know shit about Yodel. Thank you, Anthony, for bringing me to the lab. Hello and welcome to GFW"
139.0,147.16," radio. This is the podcast for August 20th, 2008. If everything just went right with the audio"
147.16,158.76, then what you heard was a clip of Anthony on one of FM talking some shit about us and I don't know
158.76,165.8, how Sean is this this whole thing's I thought it was a joke at first and actually I thought that
165.8,170.20000000000002, you were totally in on it because it just sounds like something you would do. And so I was sort of
170.20000000000002,175.96," laughing and I was like kind of laughing a neo-gaff when people were like saying, ah they're kidding around"
175.96,182.92000000000002, and then but what's just weird is like I guess he wasn't kidding. And it just on our forums too
182.92000000000002,188.44," and it's about as true the best analysis I've seen yet is that they're comparing Anthony to Isaac,"
188.44,193.8, Hayes and the whole thing with South Park where when they they've made fun of Scientology and he kind
193.8,197.64000000000001, of flipped out but in this case it's worse because I don't know it I don't want to rip on him
197.64000000000001,201.56, because seriously he you know how there's this slide on out. It's like something in every
201.56,205.64000000000001, every friend you have in his life there's just this one area that you know you don't try it into.
205.64000000000001,209.96, It's kind of like everyone I guess I did it when they're not there. I mean we talk we joke about
209.96,214.52, the shit all the time. I mean he's been in on the joke so I don't get well all the sudden he
214.52,220.28, just just decides to be a big fucking cry baby. Did you start with this though he's got a tattoo of a
220.28,225.72, twilight on his arm and when he flexes it he thinks that it makes her much dancing. That's true
225.72,229.8, and also the last time when I was in his car in his back seat he had a plastic lightsaber with
229.8,235.16, like a telescoping blade and that's another fact swear I swear to you that fucking lights
235.16,240.68, it was in his back. I mean with the happy Taco Bell burrito. I never liked that kid anyway.
240.68,245.88, I mean you know we've we joke about geeky shit all the time like we're total nerds we make
245.96,251.24, fun of ourselves so I don't know why some guy you know here who really should have been
251.24,255.72, thankful in a way he was on this podcast. I mean he's basically just kind of like a nobody
255.72,260.12, you know when he first started and now you know he's just like fucking trashing us with some other
260.12,264.2, pockets and I know we'll be in here and we'll say like fuck retro not to whatever but like we're
264.2,269.64, basically kidding but I mean he's on on this other podcast. Yeah that's some fucking dude she's been here
269.64,274.2, for like six months. He's a boxy of W radio. And then he got people to know his name the whole
274.2,278.03999999999996, chuff love thing which we like indulged in and then as soon as like people are familiar with his
278.03999999999996,282.59999999999997, name he's like oh we're gonna be on the one of the FM which is a great show and stuff but it's like
282.59999999999997,286.59999999999997, I mean there's no reason that he just had it. I mean I think it might it's either an excuse.
287.15999999999997,291.56, Well I don't know he's serious about the star worship he did. It's because maybe this is part of
291.56,296.59999999999997, some like I don't know how Andy Kaufman sort of like you know foe Andy Kaufman I won't give them
296.59999999999997,301.24, much credit but you know to sort of like clown us you know take it to some extreme where
301.96000000000004,306.2, where he's fucking around but maybe still fucking what's your take on a rubber. I just think that
306.2,311.08, some people are way too serious about their fandom about things. I mean you see it every day on
311.08,316.04, message boards people freaking out because you know they find out that two human sucks or
316.04,320.92, talking shit about star track or talking shit about star wars whatever people come to define
320.92,325.56, themselves by the things that they watch or play or whatever and it just gets out of control and I just think
326.36,333.16, he's he's just a little too into it. Brian that was that was Robert actually all right I didn't do
333.16,337.48, the intro because I'm just a little this whole fucking soap opera is just kind of got me
337.48,342.2, where did that this way. You know he's been he's been taking it hard you know Anthony he's he's my
342.2,347.32, reviews intern we had to we had to actually move him off because it wasn't working out.
347.32,352.76, He's been off for a few years after the whole star war that's what he's back on my cheeks again.
353.15999999999997,358.59999999999997, Wow you know he just got we just got an email that went around too from some pissed off reader
358.59999999999997,363.64, who was a guy who said he was like 60 something and he was complaining about the crisis walk through
363.64,368.52, because which Anthony happened to write and in this walk through there's a part that's like you know
368.52,372.52, you want to be covert here and then the walk through the next thing it says is like pull out your shotgun
372.52,379.88, and the guy's like since when is a fucking shotgun covert. So yeah it's good to know they got him on my
379.96,387.8, cheeks yeah great so go on what do you think of all the Anthony I think that the person like
387.8,393.88, it's totally being taken out of hand I mean if I can sound like a moron like I was looking through his
393.88,400.28, wallet and he has a I think from Star Wars Insider from when he was a kid and it says yeah it says
400.28,408.84, official Jedi Knight. Oh he's fucking chicken scratch I'm in official Star Wars fan club and he still has it
409.47999999999996,414.28, so it's hard if it actually still thinks it's a surprise yeah there was one time I was with them at a
414.28,419.08, concert and one of the guys started playing a Star Wars song and he said like the guy on stage was like
419.08,423.0, are there any Jedi Knights out there and everyone was like whoo an Anthony got all pissed and pulled
423.0,430.59999999999997, out his actual Jedi Knight card and was like fuck in the house. So even big of a loser yeah I mean
430.59999999999997,437.0, that's been mistaken with his new like 2004 Star Wars fan club membership card oh my god so what do you
437.0,440.44, think we should do with this guy I mean do we should we just forget about him or can we read a
440.44,445.4, billet item somehow like you seem to know more than us yeah but people of the reach that stage
445.4,449.48, like you're saying what to talk about rapper and like the lightsaber like that lightsaber's real you
449.48,454.28, could vouch for that right yeah that's definitely real as was the happy color is it's a red one
454.28,459.64, it he got his a gift from a friend because you know like he makes sounds he's maniacal enough about it
459.64,464.04, the people by ship form because they're like oh this is Star Wars and I found this at the yard so
464.04,472.84000000000003, he'll like it yeah you know in the sad thing is that he does so that's how he did up with the lightsaber
472.84000000000003,478.20000000000005, and the bad thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean like I think it's the thing about him the sad thing
478.20000000000005,482.28000000000003, is like you know like his parents know he's like 25 and everything like that but when it comes to
482.28000000000003,487.88, Chris it will be uncommon for like you know some some fucking Star Wars toys like make it into stocking
487.88,496.52, I just be like a rainbow colored Darth Vader pin something like that I mean wow
496.52,502.92, happens that's he in his adult life of her purchase like a Star Wars toy for himself yeah yeah yeah
502.92,509.24, I remember I I can't remember this time when he was like in Canada and he went out of his way to like
509.24,515.72, buy this one figure just because it said the name and French and in English oh that's what that made it like
515.8000000000001,520.76, more rare. So he thought or he could like pin pit and Casey made a French girl like like
520.76,529.24, Dr. Green. No I mean he hasn't bought I mean he hasn't bought it in any toys in a while but when
529.24,533.24, he went to look a certain they gave him a Lego set it did stoke his game bone pretty big.
539.24,542.0400000000001, Okay there's anything else to be said about y'all
543.0,549.88, Now that we're on this we could we could up the insanity by revealing that Ryan Scott doesn't exist
551.88,554.04, He's been a character yeah
554.04,558.36," Yeah, I'm the thing that was truly one of the single best PM's we ever got that's"

576.52,581.4, Bialine and they're like what the hell it seemed they seem I showed it you they seem pretty serious right
581.4,586.04," Yeah, they're like I thought Ryan was like it's been this running joke between you and Jeff that you guys"
588.6,590.6, Why why is he wow I know
591.16,594.52, So I talked so little that my my existence is in question
595.16,603.0, So fantastic I am that Ryan I imagine Ryan as you know that character in an 80s action movie who doesn't say much
603.0,607.4," But when he does it's like of grave important exactly, you know you're just your"

767.96,772.6800000000001, But come on even this seems immature GFW threat is on its ability to go joking on the entire geek world
773.0,777.32, To they are I was bold over laughing when they were making up shit just because it was so stupid and funny
777.72,781.48, But it's only joke that's what they do to react in this fashion it's real maturity
781.64,784.9200000000001, I thought you were good addition to GFW but this is just childish and I'm becoming
788.52,792.12," Okay, but this so I'll just hit up this one and then I'll let you read the rap which says a"
793.0,800.52, I want more info on you saying you got play from a yodel cosplay midget especially after clearly took all your courage to strike a conversation with a game star chick
803.0,805.96, It's because when you're in costume you've got a lot more guts
806.84,809.96," Exactly, you can hit on your role-play people go"
810.44,816.2, It's the origins and cosplay because you're taught not talking to think on that page and it goes on to the next exactly whatever
816.2,820.6," All right, then one real fan Sean could you explain your shirt after you do the rap?"
821.32,826.1600000000001," Okay, this nothing be so what you see it's like a Janet Reno"

852.76,856.12, You can you see this raise like a poem. Yodel. No shit about yodel
856.6,859.96, 6.8 point 6 one meters tall. She stood for us all
860.2800000000001,865.08, There's a Jedi master. She had grace and wisdom to eighter one left out of episode two
865.08,869.48, Do the budget concerns in fan thick level can and she saved the future Darth Vader
870.2800000000001,875.4000000000001, That's a respect of any Jedi she earns how dare you diva you disgrace a figure so divine
875.4000000000001,877.72, Her legend echoes throughout space in time
878.2,882.6, The grand battle she died for got one the greatest story told by scribe Jude Watson
883.08,888.44, No doubt Sean Elliott is weakest fuck son he's never felt the fist of puppeteer fillies and
890.0400000000001,895.1600000000001," No, don't know shit about yodel 6.1 point 6 one meters tall. She stood for us all"
899.4000000000001,903.96," Wow, there's really some of the best blood comments. Yeah, those are really great to the stuff"
904.2800000000001,907.4000000000001, She have to be listeners some spires some good great to me
908.0400000000001,913.1600000000001, So let's get this shit out of the way. I wasn't gonna say we talked about games that's coming because we actually have all been playing
913.72,917.8000000000001," Yeah, so we have like preview material and stuff but like on the elevator down here"
918.12,920.52, Anthony got an idea how to revive print
920.76,923.4799999999999, We're basically how to succeed in the cutthroat print market and
924.04,926.5999999999999, And it was 2008 wait do we want to say this on air?
926.5999999999999,929.8," No, I mean who else makes magazines is this?"
930.5999999999999,933.4," Who else yeah, no one can try that's the thing is you know"
933.4,938.28, We are always talking about how we can get new readers new readers this and you know we've been going on this new art direction
938.28,942.5999999999999," And competing with online yeah, and but the reality of it is is that there are plenty people"
942.5999999999999,946.1999999999999, Maybe they don't have access to online magazines all they got but you need to cater to them
946.2800000000001,948.84, And those are prisoners they are
949.5600000000001,953.96, Prison gamer you look at our EGM letters and like 90% of them
953.96,957.88, Like from our from prison some just thinking we need to have a like a shout out
957.88,961.88, We need to have a column written up by a prisoner where he talked about like how he was playing
961.88,967.4000000000001, St. So before lockdown or something like that I used to do EGM letters like at respond and read
967.8000000000001,970.84, EGM letters like a couple years ago and and
971.32,975.72, Always amazing me how many prison letters there were and they were all of the same kind of like man
975.72,980.52, I remember back when I got to play video games like I want a commando man
980.52,981.88, I love spy hunter
981.88,983.88, This still have that man like
984.12,987.5600000000001, Your magazine is like the only thing that keeps gaming alive for me
987.8000000000001,993.0, And it's like all this so I thought it would be even better to expand this prison concept and do a magazine
993.0,997.64, That's like stuff that prisoners can't get their hands on but want to read about in a magazine
997.72,1002.92, But I think too I could have a special calm that's like we we only preview games that are coming out 25 years from now
1003.3199999999999,1005.3199999999999, So that
1005.72,1011.4, We can have them send in another thing is that they often submit it in their letters because I did the gym
1011.4,1015.88, There's the often submitted all the shit about like if I could make a game this would be my game
1016.04,1022.84, So we could have that would be red like you know like you just a whole page after page of like the games that like the prisoners would be making if you would
1022.84,1028.56, Get out of fucking I can see that feature though like the the head would be like you know
1028.56,1034.72," Doing 25-to-life is tough, but just thinking this way when you get out virtual reality will be a reality"
1039.16,1041.16, We gotta walk this up
1043.88,1045.88," Right, how do you feel about that?"
1046.2,1047.48, Pretty good idea
1047.56,1052.84," Would you be work on that magazine? Yeah, there you go you do the reviews of prisoner made games"
1052.84,1061.0," Yeah, and that probably be a good audience because they're not gonna complain that you you know like you scored something too low or too high or that like your bias like"
1061.96,1064.1200000000001, It'll take your word for you know what
1065.24,1068.24," Yeah, I'd be so afraid everything so I'm pecking cigarettes"
1072.72,1076.04, There's a game coming out for the PC soon called prison tycoon four
1077.48,1081.2, That's it that means they they're there was a prison tycoon one through three
1084.8,1089.68, That game sounds as good as country fried steak wins days in the prison cafeteria
1090.96,1096.3600000000001, I wonder what's in that game like if it has shit where like you can run a racket by getting drugs in you know
1097.0,1100.28," Right, are you a tycoon within the prison walls or you it's like"
1101.0,1108.36, Or becoming a tycoon by your own like the private prison corporations and you're like how little can I spend on a meal
1108.36,1114.84, So the right reason other dime out of the public's fascination with locking a drug criminals
1114.84,1117.0, How many cops can you fit? Yeah single lights
1117.24,1118.52, I like whatever the
1119.8,1122.6, I must have been the bottom of the tycoon barrel. Yeah
1123.16,1129.6399999999999, But when you get to the last level you get to put together a secret black site prison and it's like there's also a party got mother tycoon
1129.88,1133.2, There is I'm not making it up there's a game called fairy godmother tycoon
1133.2,1135.8400000000001, What does that even what does that mean? I
1136.2,1138.2, Very godmother's aren't into money
1138.4,1143.64, Like who knew that they can't the granting which guys being a fairy godmother required serious management skills
1144.3200000000002,1148.44," Hey, here's an update on prison tycoon right that internet that we were just talking about"
1148.76,1155.6200000000001, So it's a simulation game the objective started to keep the prison running keep the staff happy the prisoners in the line all while trying to make money
1155.92,1158.16," So it's like yeah, it must be like a private"
1158.24,1160.24, Prussian
1160.24,1166.48, You're able to choose between New England prison to modern US Southwestern style prison in a West Coast prison model after saying quinton
1166.98,1172.2, The game was released a poor reviews as a result of dated graphics lack of depth and replay value
1175.6000000000001,1179.44," The question is IQ which is gonna be hot, but this is graphic"
1180.44,1184.28, So jury just spoke on the fucking gaming on the gaming press right there
1184.28,1186.28, 25
1188.28,1193.58, But so so what we're gonna do is our next move our next credit the graphic spuck in suck
1195.8,1198.16, I've seen better shanks man. I'd say that
1199.8799999999999,1202.8799999999999, I play boy in my toilet the fucking Ziploc bag
1205.68,1210.8, Now just like that we're gonna go into game talk just that's just how it's gonna be that's how it's gonna be
1210.8,1216.3999999999999," Well, we can actually get into a real argument and the union and said we're fake one over a space seat"
1216.3999999999999,1220.1399999999999," Yeah, let's get that out of the way since that's like that's old. It's old, but we need to hear it"
1220.1399999999999,1222.6, It's not a shelf sorry. It's not a it's not all
1223.0,1225.3999999999999," If you're in the same queen bargain, but true"
1226.04,1232.6," Yeah, I guess the thing is that I should make the caveat that I only played like the first five hours like four all based way you played all of it then"
1233.96,1235.96, I thought it was cool
1235.96,1242.64, That it I thought that this the story as I wrote in preview that I thought the storyline was actually
1242.92,1250.04, It surprised me with that I was kind of actually looking forward to seeing the twist that it takes because I could see him coming
1250.04,1252.04, You know what I mean
1252.04,1256.28," If you've read you know, we're seeing any sci-fi in the whole approach"
1256.28,1262.96," Oh 30 or 40 years, you know, you might have a clue as to you know the quote unquote twist like oh my god"
1262.96,1266.44, Maybe that kind of sinister sounding AI isn't on our side
1269.3600000000001,1271.3600000000001, Who ever thought of that oh
1273.44,1275.44," Yeah, I don't know"
1275.44,1280.2, I just thought it was a fun point click action game. I just I didn't quite think it was a
1281.08,1282.44, Was a
1282.44,1286.52, Quite as middling we need we need you to be a little bit stronger in your opinion
1286.88,1289.72, Right now you're you're kind of only so you're straddling the fence
1289.72,1293.08," We we need you to be really into the game. Well, that's the thing I haven't"
1296.2,1300.2, Saber where it was just there you found it on the street and so it put it well
1300.2,1302.92, That's how I thought about the game too though. I mean I gave it a sea
1302.92,1308.52, Hmm and I just picked that might have given it lower in fact when I turned it in I thought I turned it in as a sea minus
1308.52,1313.24," But whatever should have been yeah, I like I don't know from what I played it. Oh, it's like a high seed"
1313.24,1316.64," Yeah, I mean you can let go through it and click on shit that dies"
1317.44,1320.6000000000001, You buy stuff. I mean it wasn't like a disaster
1320.8400000000001,1325.48, But but what I said in the review was I couldn't believe how utterly
1325.48,1331.0400000000002," Mediocard was from a company that usually tries so much harder. Well, you said it was an action RPG with no"
1331.6000000000001,1338.2, No like real loot no real character leveling up there is it's not that there's any real it doesn't exist
1338.2,1342.4, There's no character creation. There's no loot at all. There's no
1343.2800000000002,1345.2800000000002, Character customization
1345.28,1349.92," I mean, it not even in the most likely you get better as you go along in some way"
1349.92,1352.08," I assume yeah, you do yes"
1352.08,1357.76, Put points in the skills you get you can put points into two different skill trees that are all utterly generic
1357.76,1364.8, It's the skills are all passive skills. I mean every single thing that you like you work on like beating the shit
1364.8,1369.6399999999999, You level up and it's like okay now my choices are I can get a 1% boost to my two hit
1370.24,1374.16, 1% whatever there's no actual like cool tannels. There's nothing to make you right
1374.8000000000002,1379.5600000000002, Now I get to whatever do the the fact also that you can level up does not a good game make
1379.5600000000002,1382.5600000000002, Of course putting that on the back of the box for like yes
1382.5600000000002,1387.4, Dynastie warrior SQL pseudo sequel and actually you don't even level up. There's not even levels
1387.4,1391.0, You reach certain points in the game and it's like now you get two more points
1391.72,1397.4," Right, see, but there's also a little bit of character customization in the workbench thing where you get to spend your parts"
1397.88,1400.5600000000002," Right, but again building up your passive abilities and stuff"
1400.56,1403.34, But that's the thing they're all passive like you you'll you get a
1403.98,1408.02, New weapon say you find a weapon on the ground and then when you get
1408.96,1413.86, Instead of dropping loot it drops like generic parts literally. That's all it's parts
1414.36,1419.26," Okay, so you have one pool of parts. You'll have like at some point you'll accumulate like 300"
1419.48,1422.56, You go to workbench and then you could spend those points in
1423.3999999999999,1429.1," Like leveling up your gun, but all the ways in which you could customize your gun are like again"
1429.26,1433.86, 1% damaging crease. It's all like fucking numbers on a spreadsheet it's like dude
1433.86,1440.8999999999999, You created a sci-fi universe where's like you know come up with some cool sci-fi shit to attach to the gun or I give me some
1441.02,1445.4199999999998, Give me something you know it's like it never made it past the Excel part of the game
1445.4199999999998,1447.4199999999998, This is the background
1447.4199999999998,1450.78, But I'm not gonna let him cut in the game sucked
1460.02,1463.86, Now the thing is is I guess it's like I hear Jeff points and I think they're totally valid
1463.86,1469.8999999999999, I guess it's like Jeff wanted more RPG and they focused too much on the action like they didn't throw in a bunch of loot
1469.8999999999999,1472.3, So you don't spend all this time in your inventory screen like
1472.86,1476.3, Scrolling over stats like which is better you don't you don't ever stop the game to do that
1476.3,1479.3, They didn't add like a huge party system like the old dungeon siege games
1479.3,1483.26, So you don't sit there and be like I need this guy to attack this this guy to attack this no
1483.26,1485.54, You're like instead you're playing and you're like I'm shooting shit
1485.54,1488.8999999999999, I'm dodging bullets. I'm throwing grenades. They made the right the office
1489.1,1493.54," They made it yeah, they did make it more accurately, but then in that case I felt like they didn't go enough that way"
1493.54,1497.4199999999998, Then either like the fact that you can't move and shoot at the same time
1497.74,1500.2199999999998, So right then to me that's saying
1500.2199999999998,1502.2199999999998, Resident Evil forces high
1506.62,1508.62, Okay
1508.62,1514.12, This is like kind of like a classic video game nerd argument though like between someone who's like
1514.4799999999998,1520.82, This mediocre game sucks in the other guys like this mediocre game's pretty fun. Yeah. Hey you
1522.6399999999999,1529.6799999999998, You seem to think that the game failed on a global level because part of the twist is is that you're able to take cybernetic enhancements
1529.6799999999998,1536.4399999999998, At the price of your own humanity or you're able to like upgrade this and droid or something that accompanies you right
1536.4399999999998,1537.8799999999999, But having
1537.8799999999999,1543.4799999999998, Upgraded yourself with all the taken the cybernetic route and having supposedly lost your humanity entirely
1543.76,1549.96, The game was had some pretty right in fact that's where I lost it with the game up until then I was like okay
1550.3600000000001,1551.72, You know fine
1551.72,1556.8, They're not trying very hard on this level or this level. They're they're sort of taking the easy way out
1556.8,1559.52, But I'm clicking my way through killing monsters fine
1559.52,1561.32, I can spend a weekend doing that great
1561.32,1564.84, So up till then it was definitely a solid sea. I wasn't hating the game
1564.84,1571.08, But it's that conceit which is what the previous all along including once a we wrote said like
1571.24,1574.4399999999998, Well the cool thing about this game is that at points in the game
1574.4399999999998,1579.24, You're gonna get a chance to replace a part of your own human body with a cybernetic part
1579.24,1583.1599999999999, And you have to make these decisions carefully along the way because if you keep doing that
1583.32,1588.1999999999998, You're gonna keep losing your humanity and at some point you're gonna be past this point of no return
1588.1999999999998,1595.12, And do you want to make that kind of sacrifice to save the human race and become some kind of like cyborg and what happens if you do
1595.12,1602.28, Is that kind of like fuck you know fuck with your whole your whole beliefs in your whole world and is it gonna change the ending to the game?
1603.0,1608.3999999999999, So I decided at some point I'm gonna go full full robot. I'm just gonna take it all the way
1609.52,1612.9599999999998, And you know they keep warning you the NPCs are like you shouldn't do that
1614.36,1616.36, Do it you know
1616.6,1618.6, It's not worth it
1618.6,1621.6, At some point do you upgrade to robot junk?
1622.0,1624.0," Yeah, you"
1625.12,1627.12, Just so you know
1627.56,1630.0," Yeah, wait wait stand"
1630.3999999999999,1632.84, Get your cod piece your death or tall cod
1632.84,1635.12, But they could still have a unit coming out though like you know robot
1635.12,1637.9199999999998, How he feels like a face coming out of like the
1638.8,1640.8, It's like the one piece of flesh
1643.6,1647.56, Look I'm willing to go all the way except for one yeah
1647.6799999999998,1652.12," Yeah, yeah 99% robot yeah, so you know"
1652.3999999999999,1658.12, You keep doing it and you get and there's no reason not to as you're going along at first because they basically say like I
1658.12,1664.0," You probably shouldn't do that because it's gonna be bad, but it's like your choice is and I'm gonna take the 5% attack bonus at my"
1664.0,1668.52," Cybernetic arm gives me or not well, I think I'll take the bonus so you do"
1668.6799999999998,1671.6399999999999, But then it gets up to where it's the brain
1671.6399999999999,1673.9599999999998," Okay, that's the final one is your brain"
1673.9599999999998,1680.12, You're gonna replace your own human brain with the cybernetic brain and by this point and I apologize if anybody thinks I'm spoiling here
1680.12,1683.7199999999998, But really the spoiler is like wait till this is like $10
1683.8799999999999,1687.9599999999998," Okay, so I'm not I'm doing your favor I promise"
1689.0,1696.9199999999998, You know it becomes clear by the time we're at the brain part that the that oh my god that AI is actually up to no good
1696.9199999999998,1700.9199999999998," And oh my god, maybe the robot people have like another agenda"
1701.08,1705.2399999999998, So like am I gonna join that side or am I gonna stick with the humans?
1705.56,1710.76," Okay, so the brain thing comes up and I really as a game right at that moment I thought like well fuck"
1711.24,1714.04, This might actually this is the part where if it's gonna matter
1714.04,1717.4, It's gonna matter and what if I do this and my character is gonna start like
1718.04,1723.64, You know start speaking weird shit or beliefs and bloops or I'm gonna start turning on the other human
1723.8,1728.68, You know AI's whatever so but I went for it. I'm just gonna play the bad guy. I never do this time
1728.68,1730.68, I'm going to so I took the brain
1731.16,1736.8400000000001, Nothing fucking happens nothing happens. It doesn't change the game at all. You're still like your voice over
1736.8400000000001,1742.1200000000001, It's still now I'm gonna go you know you're still the sort of like John Wayne all American here
1742.1200000000001,1744.1200000000001, You've got a fucking robot brain
1744.68,1750.52, You're not even human and your brain is gone your brains been replaced by a cybernator
1750.52,1757.8, The only difference is that now I know now I'm gonna really take him on the the only difference is that now you have this real affinity for craft work
1758.76,1760.76, Like all you ever really want to listen
1761.48,1769.72," This is the only real music and then you know, so you go on and and you know you have the boss battle and you save everything and then like"
1770.04,1774.36," Humanity saved and there's a cutscene of you with like the check in the game and you're like, you know"
1774.36,1778.52, Like the sign is setting and you're it's like happily ever after and she stuck with you
1778.9199999999998,1784.52, You're a fucking robot and the game the game doesn't even acknowledge it. That's what was so I couldn't believe it last week
1784.68,1789.0, So the choice was nothing talking about Brad and John it and blow and how he has this is you know
1789.56,1796.04, This notion of they're being dissonance between the story that a game play and interactivity communicates and what the actual narrative is and in this case
1796.52,1802.6, Both the game play and the story are running counter to the story if that's possible
1802.6,1805.56," Right, you know, I mean there's like the setup for the story is telling you one thing"
1805.56,1809.24, But then even the narrative itself and the game player both saying that is entirely irrelevant
1809.48,1814.28, Whether or not you remain a human or what you take the risk the alleged risk of becoming a robot
1814.36,1818.2," Yeah, I mean they could have said okay, you save the world, but look what you did to yourself"
1818.44,1822.92," You don't get the girl now and you get this pile of parts or whatever, you know"
1822.92,1826.2, They just don't have a moment or something I mean that had to be the plan
1826.2,1830.36, It's sort of hard to believe that they would emphasize that stuff and then give you no
1830.68,1831.72, You know
1831.72,1836.92, Feedback that's what the whole thing felt like to me. It felt like you know this thing got scaled back at the end
1836.92,1838.92," Or they just sort of like, how fucking?"
1838.92,1840.92, And just
1841.0,1843.0, How many people are really gonna buy this?
1843.0,1849.24," That's just just finish it. Yeah, it's move on. I really felt like they lost their their creative drive along the way"
1850.68,1854.28, I'm being hard on maybe it happens. I mean they XV the scores of all
1854.8400000000001,1856.8400000000001, Then I think in the same range
1856.8400000000001,1860.6000000000001," Yeah, I don't know it was I feel like it was worth it"
1860.6000000000001,1864.3600000000001, It was worth it. It was worth it. They tried and now I think he's a quiet over here and acts
1864.3600000000001,1866.3600000000001, I've been clowning on the game
1866.52,1868.76, Do you think successful?
1870.04,1875.28," See, but the first is like yeah, I'll tell the game well the first part is you know that's when i'm telling you though"
1875.34,1879.32," It's like the first part's great. You know, I love this kind of game, you know"
1879.32,1881.8, I play all that's I'm saying I'll play and play to the end
1881.9599999999998,1886.1999999999998," Right and when you get to the end it's like well, I'd even bother with that story if it just didn't matter"
1886.1999999999998,1888.4599999999998, I haven't given me this story experience playing
1889.1599999999999,1894.12, To human. I mean I was playing like the completed version but it came out like prior to their view copy
1894.12,1901.52, And I played it for about half an hour and it's another one of those games where you're essentially just doing the same thing over and over again to acquire loot
1901.52,1908.04, And at some point it wanted me to go to this like arcade in world to turn a crank and then go back into chrome land
1908.04,1911.1999999999998, So that a door would open and then as soon as I did that it had me do it three more times
1911.1999999999998,1916.1399999999999, Then I turned the game off at that point and that was the end of it and it's like this isn't distinction to someone like
1916.1399999999999,1919.1599999999999, You know some people say I can play this kind of game even you you're like yeah
1919.1599999999999,1922.2399999999998, It's a game I could play a weekend and click on shit and kill that's fine
1922.24,1926.6200000000001, For me it's like dude it doesn't get past that as soon as I hit this point the same reason
1926.6200000000001,1930.36, I told you know like I turned up Batman begins like I hit this point and like that's it
1930.36,1934.6, It's like there's so many good movies to watch and books to read in games to play like
1934.76,1939.24, Do you really need to click on some shit just because it's theoretically fun to click on shit?
1940.6,1946.04, Well in the case of space age I wouldn't have continued if I wasn't reviewing I got to say and and
1946.2,1951.6399999999999," The for me it was the loot thing and you know that's maybe just where we're different there, which is which is totally cool"
1952.04,1956.1599999999999," Like if you want to play more of an action game, but like for me to hook with Diablo"
1957.1599999999999,1959.72, In Titan Quest and even Dungeon Siege was
1960.48,1967.86," To get stuff, you know like what's gonna drop this time is it gonna be an epic purple item that you know nobody else got"
1968.36,1970.84, You know for me I admit it for me that's like a
1970.84,1973.52, Fine Pokemon cards kind of yeah
1974.8,1975.8, The same affiliate is I
1975.8,1981.48, Me if it's always been the storyline of games that I guess and it first I did like super lame
1981.48,1987.9399999999998, I stood and I and I liked it too at the beginning I did I mean I wanted to review the game because after the demo
1987.9399999999998,1989.4399999999998, I liked it
1989.4399999999998,1993.0," Yeah, when I saw what I wanted to do it they also made me believe that all that robot"
1993.28,1998.8, Robotic choices and everything was a lot bigger of a deal than it was exactly and so for a good chunk of the game and certainly
1998.96,2000.8, Much more so than Dungeon Siege
2001.0,2005.24," Ultimately, I think are better games, but Dungeon Siege's stories were nothing, right?"
2005.24,2008.36, And here for a good while probably as long as you played
2008.56,2016.08," It's per the storylines progressing along it's on a nice pace with a couple nice turns, but then it just kind of all turns"
2016.08,2020.6, But they went out of their way to tell you that it was gonna be like this big choice and that was gonna like
2020.6,2023.6, Sure the foundation of the game. Let's go look at the
2023.6,2029.98," Yeah, it was on the cover of way to set up a terrible review. We'll go look at the last like preview"
2029.98,2035.6599999999999, I wrote like a week and a half before it came out and that's everything I was being told to exactly you could look at the cover of
2036.1599999999999,2038.1599999999999, PC gamer had it on their cover of
2038.8,2040.9599999999998, Got to be a year ago or so or I don't know
2040.9599999999998,2047.84, So I'm back and and Chris Taylor was on the cover of the magazine and they had half of its face as Chris Taylor and half of his face as
2048.0,2051.56, You know this robot cybernetic thing again. They're stressing
2051.88,2057.72, This was the big thing about this game that this choice between humanity and a cybernetic being and it's like
2058.2799999999997,2064.96," That's getting in do it. Yeah, so what does this sort of like thing that happens with most games now that we're you know in the planning stages"
2064.96,2071.2799999999997, It's they're always telling you about how it's gonna be this amazing storytelling experience that like by playing it
2071.2799999999997,2077.0," You're gonna have this who like really cool thing happen to you, but then by the time you they finish it"
2077.0,2078.52, It just doesn't matter anymore
2078.68,2082.08, Sometimes I mean that happens and everything in games. I mean I was just thinking this week
2083.2,2089.04, About how you know I try arcs making the next call do you be game and it's set in both specific and then like the Eastern
2089.2,2091.2, front and
2091.2,2096.96, You hear there military advisors saying all these things about you know the Japanese fought differently than the Germans and more
2097.08,2101.34, Specifically they fought differently during different years of the war with depending on which island in which phase of
2101.84,2105.3, The war that they were in and it sounded really familiar to what I
2105.86,2110.2400000000002, heard when rising song came out it was the EA Pacific first person shooter in the middle of honor series
2110.2400000000002,2114.82," And they were saying all these same things and then when I actually you know, so they made this big case about this is different"
2114.82,2116.7400000000002, Enemy in a different game than when you play the game you're like
2117.3,2122.76, Dude if this guy wasn't there telling me at some point what I even noticed the difference still looks like dudes coming out of like that's
2122.76,2124.52, Farm point like line up
2124.52,2129.0600000000004," I'm talking energy every time I hit a trigger on it, you know like yeah, but it just I mean a lot of times"
2129.0600000000004,2133.6200000000003, I think designers have these these plans and it's difficult to like execute on them
2133.62,2138.24, I mean to deliver them and meanwhile they're doing like promotion two years before they're done with the game
2138.24,2141.3599999999997," So they're the Stan all this shit that just never comes to fruition. Well, that's right"
2144.2599999999998,2149.2599999999998," That's another problem yeah, it happens with a lot so let let's talk about stalkers since we're both playing that"
2149.8199999999997,2151.22," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
2151.22,2154.7, Do you feel like some of the ideas not fully realized in the first one or
2155.9,2159.06," In real eye stalker. Yeah, I don't know you know"
2159.06,2164.7799999999997, I'm like four hours into it and the thing that struck me most about it was just
2165.62,2172.02," You know, I really enjoyed the the first game quite a bit. I really like playing it, but I'm a pussy"
2172.7,2178.32, Like I'm not a horror game guy and I you know there are moments in that game like long
2179.22,2185.22, Stratches where you're by yourself the whole time and you're like fighting those scary stuff and you're running out of ammo
2185.22,2190.4599999999996, And you're you're all your equipment's dying and you're like got damn it and I
2190.74,2197.2599999999998, I really feel like this one they go out of their way to to make you feel at least like there are a lot of people on your side
2197.2599999999998,2202.8199999999997, Like immediately like it starts off here in this in this in Camment for some new faction
2203.3799999999997,2212.2999999999997, That wasn't really in the first game clear sky and and within like 20 minutes you're out in these swamps with like a pretty big crew of
2213.26,2219.2200000000003, Military guys on your side not military guys. We got some disfaction and you're like clearing these areas and they're helping you out and
2219.42,2225.02, And it it's a massive thing like pretty much right off the bat. It doesn't start off with like you know
2225.5800000000004,2230.54, a couple of like little shitty shoots shootouts and starts with like really big set piece
2230.98,2233.34, Shootouts and lots of guys on your side and it just
2234.2200000000003,2239.2200000000003," Feels a little bit more approachable in that way, but at the same time like just they pour out so much stuff"
2239.58,2246.4199999999996," And that first 30 minutes, you know, you know like where you've got to clear like all these areas and guys are asking for help"
2246.66,2249.22," Every five seconds, you know, did you get that again?"
2249.22,2253.06," And you don't have to do any of it. Yeah, if you don't want well, you have to clear out the"
2253.62,2256.2599999999998," You have to do the faction more thing in the beginning, don't you?"
2256.2599999999998,2262.3399999999997," Yeah, well, there's like when you leave the town there's you immediately get a distress call from the local guys that are fighting like those mutant boars"
2262.58,2268.5, You don't have to help them. There's like another watch tower that's taken over by bandits and like if you go through the order of the missions
2268.5,2273.06," Sort of like in in the order there are made available for you. Yeah, and that's the next one"
2273.06,2277.54," And then there's the church, but really if you want you can skip all that and you go up to the big base where"
2277.78,2283.16," Where the guys are at and that's the faction mission. Yeah, but it's like it's definitely like I did everything like you're saying"
2283.16,2290.98," I went and every submission on there. Yeah, at first it seems kind of intimidating because you're you set out to go to one spot on the map"
2290.98,2295.86," You're you're going toward it and then all of a sudden you're like help me, Mark, we're being surrounded"
2295.86,2302.5," Like okay, you have to haul ass to get there a lot of times if you're not fast enough if you like run out of stamina or something"
2302.58,2307.82," Then it'll be like the guys will get killed they'll die there. You know, and then that's it or if you get there ahead of time"
2307.82,2311.1400000000003," Because all that stuff there, you know, the game is like mega about"
2311.6600000000003,2312.6600000000003, Simulating
2312.6600000000003,2317.2200000000003, Things in the world so they've got everything running on timers and so they'll be like okay
2317.2200000000003,2323.54, Well these guys are gonna have their camp invaded at such and such time and we're gonna play the radio announcement to you
2323.9,2327.1," Right now, but if you're if you're like pretty close to them when they play the announcement"
2327.1,2331.94, They're like help we're being attacked and you run over there and if you get that really quick
2331.94,2333.94, There's still like a guy strumming
2334.82,2338.18, Jumping is guitar next to the fire
2339.38,2343.9, What do they like hey stalker and then you know then like two minutes later
2344.2599999999998,2350.7799999999997, This is this is the big interesting thing for me is like the extent to which like things are procedural and then which they're running on a timer
2351.7400000000002,2357.3, The experience of playing the game is that they're all these like autonomous groups just doing things on their own
2357.3,2360.6200000000003, So like you can ignore them and at other times you might be in a fight and then all of a sudden
2361.46,2365.26, Assistance comes up to help you and if you die or and you go to your last save and do it again
2365.42,2368.0600000000004, Maybe they might not arrive because of the timing is different
2368.0600000000004,2371.42," Yeah, but I do think that it is all working on like this route"
2371.42,2375.86, So like if you were to sit there and wait you would see those guys fight the boars in the first thing
2376.1400000000003,2381.1, Head over to the tower go through the church go up the hill and it would just basically be doing it
2381.1,2385.98," But you can just like you're skipping it all by going over to some other area in this warms, you know"
2386.1400000000003,2389.1400000000003, That sucks at that happened though like I can that is being coupled
2389.1400000000003,2394.46," Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's sort of thing happening. I do like like that aspect of the game is fun though"
2394.46,2397.06, Just to see like what's going on and the guys are good
2397.06,2402.6200000000003, They they they're effective and they're fighting. They do use the cover well like in the way that when they showed those demonstration videos
2402.62,2410.74," I was like how much of this is scripted how much is perceived really know yeah, but the one problem is is that the fucking enemies will push you out of the way to take your cover"
2410.94,2415.72, So like if you're in a good spot you it's like you almost need to play like shit if I'm working with guys
2415.9,2422.74, If I was a programmer where am I gonna like tell what am I gonna like highlight in the code for these to be good places for our eye
2422.74,2425.2799999999997, To go and if you're there and then they want to go there
2425.2799999999997,2427.18, They'll just push your ass out of the way and they think
2427.18,2429.18, I just like
2429.18,2434.04," Dissteer well like shooting guys, you know I'm doing the lean two thing and I'm just looking down my sights and all of a sudden"
2434.04,2438.08, I'm just like moved jerking around the map and I turned and look and it's like my team is posted
2438.08,2441.08, Where I just was makes for throwing me out to the fucking bad
2441.08,2445.56, To be there's there's a there's a moment later on the game after you leave this wums
2445.56,2451.2799999999997, Where you're looking for this guy and you find him at the bottom of this valley standing out of rock and he's like
2451.28,2455.42, Merch her you have been get up on this rock there are mutant dogs everywhere
2455.42,2460.1200000000003, And see jump up on the rock and then all these mutant dogs come down like lots and lots of him
2460.1200000000003,2462.8, You start picking them off and the mother fucker just pushed me off the rock
2464.0400000000004,2467.92, Into this pack of dogs you tore me apart. It's like cheap things
2469.1200000000003,2474.1000000000004," But you know, it's it's bound to happen with a game with that much stuff going on and somehow"
2474.1000000000004,2477.7400000000002, I don't know stock your pulls this trick for me where you know
2478.2599999999998,2482.9799999999996, Somehow I'm able to swallow a lot of like bullshit like a lot of like glitched out
2483.62,2490.52," Surged messed up stuff because like when it clicks it's so awesome. Yeah, this is exactly how the first game was for me too"
2490.52,2495.0," Yeah, just yeah, I tend to be more forgiving of that sort of thing and not focus on it"
2495.0,2496.7, I just like I don't know
2496.7,2502.58, It's a kind of amazing feel because we got this version of their story in our minds is like all these Ukrainians next thing
2502.58,2505.8199999999997," You know, they're gonna have to be fending off Russia and like fucking they can have a bug"
2508.06,2511.2599999999998, I don't know I think I think some of it
2512.8999999999996,2520.7799999999997, Is is just that what they're trying to do is so cool and that what and that it has like so few comparisons
2520.7799999999997,2525.3399999999997, Other things that I've played at least that I'm willing to take it and it usually doesn't really
2526.06,2529.8199999999997, It doesn't really break your game. I mean I might break the illusion sometimes like I mean
2529.8199999999997,2531.8199999999997, I came across some really like
2532.34,2540.42, Bad stuff later on where you know I'd be fighting a huge group of enemies and I somehow killed a magical one and all the enemies disappear
2541.7000000000003,2546.28, Which should clarify that we are playing preview preview and that's something that I imagine
2546.28,2548.54," Well, I think's like that should be fixed"
2548.54,2552.54, I'll say like like stuff where you're getting shoved out of cover just because you know
2552.78,2557.7400000000002," That's how the AI is working like that that doesn't bother me much, but there's some there can fix that"
2557.7400000000002,2561.8," Yeah, and I think it has to do with the fact that they are like pushing a lot"
2561.82,2567.94, More density in the game and a lot a lot more characters on screen a lot more AI a lot more simulation like the
2568.3,2574.78, The first game it was like wide open spaces a lot of wide open spaces with very little in between it and a lot of that was nice
2574.78,2578.46, In that it really set the atmosphere that people appreciate about it
2578.7000000000003,2583.3, But they are definitely and it made it the it communicated the sense of actually traveling
2583.3,2587.1000000000004, So I mean you felt like if you're in a new area you felt like in an MMO
2587.1,2590.22, You know when you cross these enormous spaces and don't have the teleport option
2590.22,2595.02," Right, I mean that's kind of like the cool thing about as you feel as though you you've actually crossed some distance"
2595.02,2596.46, I mean it does a little bit of that
2596.46,2600.88, Well the but the clear skies definitely more dense
2600.88,2606.1, There's more stuff to do in between you definitely from based a base is a little bit shorter
2606.1,2609.74, I feel like there are more bases where you can like unload your loot and and
2610.2999999999997,2611.5, You know
2611.5,2616.02, Buy new equipment stuff but like beyond that there's also just lots of little pockets of
2616.54,2618.7, enemies that you consider it can front if you want to
2619.02,2625.58, Little situations that you can stumble on to you that I just feel like it's way more packed in than the first game
2625.58,2630.54, They try to like the real estate is much there's much more of it now like in that first level the swamps
2630.54,2634.02, It's really enormous when you're going through there and it's also cool too
2634.02,2638.58, I found out that like just because there's time of day dynamic time of day change and dynamic weather change
2638.58,2645.2599999999998, It's a whole another experience to like be out in like the reads when it's pitch black and there's like lightning and rain coming down
2645.26,2648.98," And you've got a flashlight going through the weeds and you hear like some shitty growling in it, you know"
2648.98,2652.36," Yeah, then it is when you're in the day and when you're with a bunch of guys, you know, yeah"
2652.36,2658.0600000000004, But then then they'll also it seems like they're trying to throw a lot more things in the environment to like
2658.0600000000004,2660.0600000000004, KPU busy and that will be like you know if there's like
2660.5,2666.6200000000003," So when someone else say hey, I got a tip for you pay me 200 bucks and I'll give it to you and then what it does is it marks a point on your map"
2666.6200000000003,2668.9, And you go and maybe inside of a hole in the log
2668.9,2670.9, There's a stash for you to grab
2671.42,2675.54," Maybe inside of a cabin of a truck, you know, like sitting on the seat. There's like a box and then you can"
2676.7400000000002,2681.98, And even in the past you know that the common head was there be in stock or one there might be these enormous like
2682.26,2685.3, You know like wonderful like sets of architecture and stuff
2685.3,2686.58, There's nothing in them now
2686.58,2688.9, When you do climb it up and around those things
2688.9,2691.98," They're almost always is some kind of like hidden cash, you know"
2691.98,2698.38," There's like a little tan and you shoot it open you can get something out of it and yeah, and they are reusing a lot of"
2699.34,2703.3, Environments and buildings and assets and stuff from the first game
2703.3,2705.02, I mean the same location come a lot
2705.02,2708.2200000000003, They've mixed them up. There's some sort of story line about how
2708.7000000000003,2716.62, between the prequel and stalker. There's like some sort of mega emission that literally twists the landscape or something because
2716.86,2722.02," Things are there, but they're not there like they used to be they're kind of mixed up right now"
2722.34,2728.1800000000003, That's one one way that I'm waiting to seek is right where I'm at now is actually a section that's in the original
2728.18,2734.3799999999997," Stalker of course it appears different no, yeah, but I was I'm hoping that they they get more mileage out of it than I'm seeing so far"
2734.3799999999997,2736.3799999999997, So so for example if you go
2736.54,2739.5, To an area that's like I play this in the first one
2739.5,2742.54, This is like there's so many opportunities here. There's one plane and your expectations
2742.54,2746.74," There's you used to one thing being here and then now we can do something else with it, you know"
2746.74,2750.94," Yeah, and then also in their own sense it's like here's a second stab at it. It's like a second edit"
2750.94,2755.06, So it's like well what would we have really done now that we have to benefit a hindsight with this?
2755.06,2761.92," Yeah, you mean which particular area? Yeah, so like same if you're in part whole parts of this game appeared in their original stocker in a different form"
2761.92,2767.62," In it, you know, although they're tons of new areas too that are enormous and so it's like if it's is it really just like"
2767.62,2771.16," Hey, I remember that house and you go in there now it's just it maybe it was like"
2771.62,2776.7999999999997," Like you take dogs before now there's some bandits in there, but I mean what if there's like I want like well"
2776.7999999999997,2781.48, There's a lot of like water later on you'll find bases that at one point had been like
2782.04,2784.04, Sort of scary
2784.04,2789.22," Underground spots, you know, they're not underground bases, but like I specifically remember there's this one"
2789.22,2793.28," I don't know, maybe you call it like a dungeon in the original game"
2793.28,2798.52," Yeah, that where you where you start out in this big like concrete military complex and you make your way down"
2798.52,2802.56, But it was always like an enemy spot now it's a base or
2803.16,2806.76," You know, they change around a lot of stuff like the dumps used to be like so"
2807.32,2814.6600000000003, Full of radiation that you couldn't just like go traipsing up to them and now now you can like walk all over the dumps because they don't have that problem now
2814.6600000000003,2818.5600000000004," Yeah, so so do you guys feel like because I've only you know"
2818.5600000000004,2824.82," I've played like the first few hours that the original stalker. Yeah, and it's like do you think like this one's like improved upon enough"
2824.82,2828.84, Or feels like so drastically different that if I like wait and play stalker clear sky first
2828.84,2833.9, Before I play regular stalker is I'm gonna feel like I'm taking two steps back playing the original stalker or like
2834.42,2838.2200000000003, I don't feel like I don't feel like that yet not from what I've played
2838.2200000000003,2842.44, I mean it might feel like a little more bare and to play the original
2842.44,2848.4, It's cool. I mean it almost seems cool to play the prequel before. I mean the are you the same character from the from this?
2848.4,2854.26," No, you're different. Yeah, okay, and there's technical things like I mean this they've really optimized the code"
2854.26,2860.5, So with this one I had issues running the original this one really well and it has like a host of new effects and stuff
2860.5,2865.14, So it will be a step backwards that in that respect the other thing that sucks
2865.14,2869.62, I mean I really do feel it it works best for people like us who played the original and come back to it now
2869.62,2874.26, Is it like we've talked about this game over and over on GFW radio since that reviews and servo debt
2874.26,2878.46, And it's like it's it's clear that it's been like that experiences stuck with me
2878.46,2881.14, But I just haven't been ready. You say like I'm gonna go replay that game
2881.14,2883.06, And so here's like a great way now. I'm like okay
2883.06,2889.58, I am playing it again and it's like I am getting the nostalgia because sometimes it is the the same area
2889.7,2895.64," Stop, but there's all this new stuff and it really isn't in game. You know, yeah, it's kind of I appreciate that element. Yeah"
2896.64,2900.04, I still like the bizarre mix of the fact that
2901.1,2908.98, It's still stocker still has these this menu system and like and a lot of graphics like overlay graphics that look like
2908.98,2916.14," They're from like a 1990s PC game, you know, you've gotten to all this trouble to create a world that is pretty like"
2916.14,2920.2999999999997, believable modern 3D world with like great effects like shunza
2920.2999999999997,2924.94, They're they're adding like all these cool lighting and and like smoke effects and crazy stuff and
2925.62,2931.2599999999998, But then you know the the the the the map and everything that you pull up and and like even
2931.2599999999998,2935.8599999999997, When you're talking to someone like in the tavern or something it brings up like a little pixelated like face of
2936.06,2939.74, Of you they are I mean it look I just looks like something from like 15 years ago
2939.74,2942.14," Yeah, Ellie Ellie D battleships"
2942.14,2946.22," Yeah, I think battle ship the game from a tell has like better graphics times"
2946.62,2949.74, But I don't know the end of that. Oh back stuff too like we're talking
2950.7799999999997,2955.3399999999997, Like before we were recording we both got to this part where these guys basically gank you in full
2955.58,2960.3799999999997," Yeah, it's not you can't correct it like if you go to this one part and you don't you have this choice"
2960.3799999999997,2963.3399999999997, Like these guys tell you to put your gun down and be be their bitch and
2963.5,2965.58, You're definitely outnumbered it when I got there
2965.58,2970.22, I didn't even have a radiation suit and the environment was killing me as it was I was just eating through my packs
2970.2999999999997,2973.8999999999996, I'm like I'm not gonna fight these guys all armed with machine guns and stuff so I'm like all right
2973.8999999999996,2977.24, I'll give you my stuff and you look and it's like do they take everything yeah
2977.24,2981.8999999999996, Take everything you got every dollar you've earned some of all these side missions and stuff and that's it
2981.8999999999996,2986.9399999999996, You don't go 20 minutes down the road and catch up with their boss and kill him and get your shit back. It's gone
2986.9399999999996,2988.9399999999996, It's gone that's unthinkable
2988.9399999999996,2993.3399999999997," Wow, and like yeah, yeah, I mean that's a really old right that seems like an old"
2993.3399999999997,2995.2999999999997," Yeah, that's a tough thing like old school thing"
2995.2999999999997,2999.2599999999998," It's a little bit immersive, but yeah, and there's just I don't know"
2999.34,3004.78, It's funny to see like the design choices that had had this game been made by an American team would be so different
3004.78,3008.38, I mean if stock of his American game it would have no HUD
3008.94,3016.0200000000004, Like if it they would try like really hard to keep you in the world and to not like distract you with like
3016.0200000000004,3020.0600000000004, RPG stuff and all of everything and they wouldn't even have so many options for missions
3020.0600000000004,3023.7000000000003," They would be like God, you know like Western players are really complete"
3023.7,3028.8999999999996, You know so many of them and they they don't want to feel like they're missing out on stuff because we're offering in these side missions
3028.8999999999996,3032.46, And they don't get there in time where they have to choose to go this way or this way they can't help everyone
3032.62,3035.06, Then they just gonna reset the game and try to do it all
3035.06,3039.5," Yeah, yeah, they really want it's like dude you make some choices and that's it like that's how it's gonna be you know"
3039.5,3045.8999999999996," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean and just the complexity in general like these guys are not showing away from complexity in any way"
3045.8999999999996,3052.1, And they're throwing it all at you and and then you know and they won't eat a worry about like radiation levels
3052.1,3057.38, And whether or not your character has eaten lately and like the condition of your armor and all this
3057.38,3060.86," Yeah, all this stuff that like to Western Village really well"
3060.86,3067.06, I totally felt that way about the Witcher which is another you know East East European
3067.98,3072.98, Game where they just throw every did you play it to get actually into playing the whole thing
3072.98,3079.2999999999997," I mean the the Witcher. Yeah, I've only played a little bit of okay, but like they did the same thing with the interface and the you know"
3079.3,3083.5800000000004," The screens for like making potions. Yeah, if you saw that screen. There's like"
3084.1800000000003,3088.1400000000003," You know, yeah, it was like actually like being in chemistry class"
3090.5,3097.1400000000003," I think of like growing up completely on PC game. Yeah, like consoles never penetrated there"
3097.1400000000003,3101.02, And it's still like totally PC dominated and I'm not complaining either
3101.02,3107.3, I like that. I mean it reminded me of like the old wizardry games or where these RPGs were it's like you really had to like think about the fuck
3107.3,3112.6600000000003," Yeah, and you really had to make choices with the quest and things like that. I mean it just yeah"
3112.6600000000003,3118.1600000000003," Yeah, I think you're right now. Those guys are doing that that you know download old school game service"
3118.1600000000003,3120.6600000000003, It's totally mixed and totally mixed and
3120.6600000000003,3123.02, God okay before we go on a good old game is again
3123.02,3129.28, It's time for a special segment. This is what this we're out of the background now. We received a bunch of candy
3129.28,3134.36, We're not playing this game. We're playing this game. This week. Sammy follow
3135.08,3137.08, Senus a bunch of
3137.32,3141.56, What are they called bean booze jelly bellies and the thing is you've heard of the nasty
3142.1200000000003,3146.6600000000003, Harry Potter jelly beans like like piggy-bottom and like like
3147.02,3151.76, I don't think they had pickle the handroid. It was very Potter just stuff like JK Rowling whatever
3151.76,3157.1200000000003, So with the flavors the flavors were nasty what this is is they pair they look identical
3157.1200000000003,3163.1600000000003," But you're basically playing roulette, so you might get what what is called top banana or it could be pencil shavings"
3163.2799999999997,3168.48, You could get butter popcorn also the same colors a rotten egg or there's like oh
3168.48,3174.2," You're a X-Late, Bugger and juicy pear baby wipes coconut vomit peach moldy cheese"
3174.6,3178.2, I don't know what we're gonna do let me look at the book no cuz you're part of the guinea pig
3178.2,3181.44, We're gonna look at this so what we need to do is we're all gonna
3181.96,3187.8999999999996, 6 grade truth or dare I'm not doing this someone someone spent $5 buying some fucking candy
3188.14,3190.14, I'm gonna make it
3190.78,3194.82, So we can even just do around but like so the first one let's go for these
3194.82,3201.06," We just take one my we're all gonna take the same brain. He's taking one. That's the worst one. It doesn't don't go ruin in it, man"
3201.06,3207.98, We're you know if there's one lesson that I have learned here. I know it's the if Sean Elliott comes up to you and says hey
3207.98,3210.54, Grab your check this out communion you don't
3210.54,3217.06," You do not you just got it right now and tells you to eat Ryan this guy for you grab it. No, come on come on come on"

3239.2200000000003,3244.34," Anthony you got vomit. Oh wait wait. Okay. The letter also says got the fuck. Oh, you know what"
3249.54,3255.54, I got that it is wait that was like eating vomit these are actually from Sam. I read the wrong thing
3255.54,3257.2200000000003, He's really our Bernie bot. Oh
3257.2200000000003,3259.2200000000003, So something the right rule Jeff
3259.58,3264.86," Yeah Sam who sent this into us says you have to chew and swallow or your giant pussy. Well, I'm a giant pussy"
3264.86,3267.78, I just spit mine that one was way to the floor
3268.6200000000003,3271.7000000000003, Gross when you said like that it would be these different flavors
3271.7000000000003,3277.0600000000004," I thought that it would be like like a joke on it, but that was like actual vomit smell"
3277.6200000000003,3279.1400000000003, Oh
3279.1400000000003,3281.6200000000003, I haven't come that close to throwing up in a long-ass nightmare
3282.5800000000004,3285.38, All right one one more round in and we'll do something else
3286.02,3291.82," So let's do the pair. Let's do the pair. I already got vomit. Okay, do everyone grab one now"
3292.1400000000003,3294.94," It's either clear God, either a pair or a booger"
3294.94,3299.18," This is a booger tastes like yeah, you don't remember I guess we're about"
3302.18,3306.26, Go Jeff don't strike don't do no her leash it on this
3310.9,3315.58," I got booger it tastes like it dirt. Yeah, like a dirt"
3317.5,3321.06, It tastes like a penny my spit and I download why do you
3321.06,3323.06, I
3323.06,3325.06, Sets all of it that said I download
3326.46,3328.46," Okay, we're"
3328.94,3330.94, I got a story how you digest
3331.74,3335.06," Well, oh, go ahead and go for the next round and I'll just tell you"
3335.06,3337.06, What we did to run?
3337.06,3341.7799999999997, Baby wipes and coconut is the hero of the podcast. He just brought in glasses of water
3342.06,3345.54," Oh, during this frat hazing we're happy. Oh, thank you, sir"
3345.54,3349.2999999999997, So we used to hang my friend Hans. I used to hang out with this guy Marcel
3349.3,3352.26," Yeah, and at one point we gotten this discussion about"
3353.6600000000003,3363.0600000000004, That when the last time he performed kind of linguess and it turned out that Marcel fit a certain stereotype about about black males and that he actually
3363.0600000000004,3368.3, He was he didn't he professed not to enjoy it. And so as we're talking you're supposed to be your beans as I talk about this
3368.3,3374.7000000000003, And while we were talking about we're like so wait like when was the last time and he's like 93 and this was in 99
3374.7000000000003,3378.38, So we just like really and then then he just dropped the line that made it all worthwhile
3378.38,3380.38, He's like it tastes like penny
3381.34,3383.34, penny forever after
3383.94,3390.42, Moreless stories something something you had doesn't taste good taste like a penny like a penny. I think I think that sounds
3391.42,3395.26, Unclean there might be something like we thought about we're like it was just random
3395.26,3401.1400000000003, But if you really think about it there might be some explanation. We don't want to get into it. I have to do with a certain cycle
3401.82,3403.82, All right
3403.82,3406.1400000000003, I'm telling this conversation
3406.14,3412.02, I just had one last being right here. This is how important a rotten egg. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it either
3412.02,3415.96, I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I'll make sure it's going to make you vomit. Let's do it
3417.2999999999997,3419.2999999999997, Right in front of me
3420.62,3421.62, All right
3421.62,3423.62, I split that out of a pussy that's the end of the dog
3425.2599999999998,3426.2599999999998, Bad
3426.2599999999998,3429.2599999999998, That was really strong. Wow. You should have seen these guys faces
3429.7799999999997,3431.7799999999997, Oh my god
3431.7799999999997,3435.5," Yeah, that's scared me that was foul. Okay, so you know what?"
3435.5,3440.58, I want to think good that I can eat after that. You just don't know you might have popcorn
3442.58,3447.62," You should find a blue one because that's either toothpaste or Barry. Oh, yeah, that one's good. Oh, that's not too bad"
3447.62,3450.38," This okay, it reminds me of a YouTube video"
3450.38,3455.82," I want to watch people played rock paper scissors. Yeah, like the loser had to put their hand in a mouse trap"
3456.26,3460.76," Gee, you could have sent some like good candy like that. Oh my god"
3461.7200000000003,3468.0400000000004," Okay, so I know we can't talk about a certain game your play. Yeah, I'm playing a game that's really"
3469.0400000000004,3474.5600000000004," Anthony, well, he's children. Yes, I was just trying to give him some to clean up that candy time is over"
3475.1600000000003,3481.0800000000004, Tell us about your homework Anthony. You just saw Donov war two and the reveal of the tyranny race. It was red
3482.48,3487.0400000000004," So they're finally letting us play tyrannism and teasing with us for well, yeah, I mean years"
3487.32,3491.8," They wouldn't talk about how they play or anything yet because you know, all-wise all-ice I was a"
3492.44,3497.74, A single player campaign mission against them and the whole point of the level they showed us was to show like a
3498.08,3500.4, I don't know how much this will play in the multiplayer because
3500.84,3503.56, But they wanted you to see like in single player
3504.4,3510.24, If you like because the way it works is you get an overall campaign map and you can see like there's like a light tyrannin in
3510.4,3512.96," Festation a heavy one, et cetera"
3513.2,3517.44, Real quick aside for those not even no tyrannists if you ever heard of the zerg
3517.6,3520.44, You'll probably be drawing comparisons of course tyrannism around first
3520.64,3527.2, But this is an alien race in the war hammer universe. That's all basically in sectoid types things of different classes and
3528.36,3534.96, Every single of the 12 expansion packs of Donov war had every time there be new races the boards people
3538.96,3542.6," Yeah, and I guess part of that was maybe they just didn't think the technology was there"
3542.6,3544.6, I think that was the
3544.6,3546.6, Give them but
3546.6,3551.18," So yeah, we saw tannins and the whole thing with them is if you like don't take care of their infant station"
3551.38,3553.56, Infication really they like start warping the planet
3553.56,3556.24, So like on the level we saw it was a pretty heavy infestation
3556.24,3561.68, So as you progress they went from like a swamp to like a swamp that looked all like kind of semi alien
3562.08,3563.08, What was that?
3563.08,3567.7," Hab it was that trait of the tannids established in like the warhammer 40,000"
3568.2599999999998,3573.46, Or before the starcraft came out with the with the zerg because they of course
3573.62,3578.5," Zerg do the sort of terraforming it had no I was always under the impression yeah, that I mean"
3578.5,3581.14," I'm not exactly next to it, but I thought that yeah"
3581.58,3586.4199999999996, Tannits come in the eat everything on the planet basically and turn it all tyrannid then they move on so
3587.06,3589.3399999999997," But yeah, what do you know about tyrannid lactation?"
3589.8599999999997,3591.8599999999997, Tannits a day
3592.5,3594.6800000000003, Cat camera rovers they're not mammals all right
3595.6200000000003,3597.6200000000003, Oh
3599.2200000000003,3603.54," But yeah, so like in phase one it was like the land would look kind of shitty and there'd be like these little"
3603.54,3605.1400000000003, Sporemines that would come towards you and
3605.38,3611.7200000000003, Sporemines will just like roll up on you semi-sentian type things that seek you out in the blood and like phase two is like
3612.02,3616.86, Little like turret looking things would come out of the ground and they'd launch like projectiles at you and
3616.86,3621.6600000000003, The phase three was like what you think of as a starcraft hive like a full hive would come in every 10 seconds
3621.6600000000003,3626.58," It would spawn more tyrannids, so you have to take that shit out. Yeah, I'll still do it"
3626.58,3632.6200000000003, They can quickly overwhelm you but what was cool was actually a pile of bones and garlic it was like the pile bones are got
3632.98,3634.98, But what was cool was actually seeing like a
3635.46,3642.9, The way that the tyrannids animated and it was we were talking with what was that guy's name? I can't remember Johnny the producer
3642.9,3644.9," I believe it's on her yeah, I"
3645.2200000000003,3650.82," Believe so I apologize that I don't remember your name, but if you listen, but"
3651.86,3657.64, You know the coolest thing was talking to hearing him talk about how they they wanted to make the tyrannids come to life
3657.64,3659.86, Like because they'd always done like in company here
3659.86,3667.64," They had animated squad AI and you know, but basically Germans Brits Americans they all acted kind of the same because they're all humans looking out for themselves"
3669.26,3673.54, But you know when it came to tyrannids that are like these like hive mind organisms
3673.54,3679.66, So how do you portray like how they would act and so they actually went to a Jurassic Park the film for their inspiration
3680.2599999999998,3685.66, So like when you see like the things coming at you they approach you like the way raptors would and then they like if you approach them
3685.66,3690.2599999999998, Into meally combat that like bound backwards to like get to the proper distance and stuff
3690.66,3696.0," It's kind of hard to describe, but if you think about the way you remember dinosaurs moving dressed apart. It's kind of way the tyrannids move"
3696.38,3701.94," But yeah, I mean I'm I remember is the scene with someone getting eaten on the toilet"
3703.54,3708.36," That wasn't a tourist that was some Jurassic Park two or something. No, that was that first part"
3708.36,3713.22," It was yeah, it was the lawyer that's like one of my favorite experiences that guy got spit on"
3713.62,3719.66," No, why some little dinosaur all I remember is that must have been one of my first nerd experiences because I love the boy"
3719.66,3721.66, The book was so much better
3722.22,3724.22, So
3724.22,3727.5," The book wasn't a lot better. Yeah, but it's still stuck"
3727.5,3732.46, But if you were in fifth grade and kicked ass
3733.02,3739.08," Yeah, all right, I'm talking another one of these things. Somebody baby wipe or coconut"
3739.08,3744.98, I really don't close out. It's it's gonna be this huge distraction baby wipes. That's really I got coconut. That's awesome
3745.5,3747.5, See another one
3747.5,3754.86," No, I understand odds and statistics. Yeah, but you keep eating the jelly beans. It doesn't matter what flavor you're eating"
3754.86,3762.54," Yeah, you're talking to a black Jack expert here. Yeah Ryan. Yeah. Are you going to we not supposed to tell that on air?"
3762.54,3767.02, I know that I would call myself a black Jack expert. Would you call yourself a compulsive gambler?
3768.02,3772.26, Would be if I had the money did you get to the point where you were paying your money on gambling?
3772.26,3776.1, Were you begging for a comp at the casino for like a comp at the buffet?
3776.1,3781.1400000000003," No, if you were if you were at Vegas and there was a star check online convention"
3781.66,3788.3799999999997, Happening at the same time would you go to that or would you or would you gamble or would you go to the store?
3788.3799999999997,3790.3799999999997, I don't actually like Star Trek
3790.3799999999997,3796.14, So if you walk into the casino and there were five black Jack tables and the dealer was a cling on at one favorite
3797.7,3800.02, We're stable which you go to
3801.46,3803.46, Which which table plays with the fewest egg
3805.5,3807.5, Well obviously he's got the fucking
3808.3,3809.5, Oh
3809.5,3814.34, Great thing is you could have an actual puppy hour long discussion on that if you got a couple stars
3814.34,3815.34, Groupals was Ryan
3815.34,3819.94, Gamma star Trek when did when did you start waste now your money on gambling? I
3820.34,3823.5, Why I didn't I did you first realize you were an addict though?
3823.94,3825.46, What the hell wait?
3825.46,3828.74, There's whole podcast so we're just waiting to do an intervention. Yeah
3830.06,3833.42, We're talking about you always all a lot of money
3834.06,3839.02, He tried to say if I would go pick him up to scratch off he'd let me use sport
3843.5,3846.06," Then when I and then when I brought him he's like no, I need a pull tab"
3848.54,3851.9, Fucking in the way from seven up because they're just they're running to
3852.54,3858.42, Did I ever tell you that I worked at a 711 in high school and like that
3858.42,3863.06, I would tell you this I worked at a 711 in high school with like the two other guys who are in my band at the time
3863.42,3868.5, And we just like ran the place the only other guy we ever worked with was this old dude named Ron
3868.66,3870.66, He was a compulsive scratch off
3871.42,3879.78, Dude who should never have been working working at a gas station and he would come in and just take a roll of scratch off like
3880.54,3885.7000000000003, 200 pull them out taking one of the backs scratching off then ring them up and get the money
3885.7000000000003,3889.34," We're as fingers like permanently silver now he's the coin, you know"
3889.9,3894.7000000000003," Didn't use his fingers. Oh, rather like that this fingers we still were for my vision not gonna lie"
3894.7000000000003,3897.02, But I did that for a long time when I go to the casino
3897.02,3902.3, I do hunt down the a start war slot machine. You do. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think you're gonna do better that? No
3902.78,3906.6000000000004, That's the little like that's the wheel of four. Just gonna feel that's the one that's better
3906.6000000000004,3910.6200000000003, Do you guys think the gamers are more likely or less likely to gamble?
3911.02,3916.38," There's probably like gosh just like the loose is correlation of ending. I mean, yeah. I don't know"
3916.86,3920.1800000000003, And I think that gaming like I feel like there's a lot of like poker players
3921.42,3925.54," Yeah, but maybe that's just the age group like all every all the young people play poker now"
3925.54,3929.7400000000002," I think that's probably yeah, like just a general like age group thing before we leave 7 11"
3929.7400000000002,3933.02, I've been waiting for the opportunity to make this public service announcement
3933.02,3936.78," Okay, well, we're still in that 7 11 and I wanted to point out in the past"
3936.78,3942.58," You know, we talked about how and a piece of father can get basically everything you need to keep his household abusive at the counter"
3943.54,3946.74, 7 11 but furthermore of a faint
3947.54,3953.18, Can't have a great time there as well like if you're ever to 7 11 and sometimes it might be next to the panoros
3953.18,3957.54, But they're like these miniature roses and they come in a small vial and if you ever look at that you're like
3958.18,3962.98, I don't know just just because baby by girlfriend wants to put this on her lapala or something
3962.98,3968.62, But really you get throw the rose away and the vial is a crack pipe and it comes with it's open on two wins
3968.62,3971.22, Something when they sell like allusia single cigarette
3971.22,3975.44, They'll come in the same thing or a cigar and they'll have the same kind of thing those are all
3975.44,3980.8599999999997, Just be just be aware that those are crack pipes and awesome. What a great public service. I have podcasts
3980.8599999999997,3987.9, Providing I found multiple crack pipes. How to find cheap crack pipes by GFW radio no
3987.9,3992.18, I'm sure by Zif Davis meeting that you actually crack has those in a podcast
3992.74,3998.3799999999997, That's the manager. That's the speaker manager and demand an answer say what is this for?
3999.1,4001.3799999999997, And he says it's it's it's a mini
4003.58,4005.58, The thing our one Mexican cast member
4008.58,4018.7," Yeah, I have a 7 11 story. I get awesome. I have a friend who used to work at a 7 11 many years ago and I heard the story through him and he"
4019.66,4022.4199999999996, He was robbed many times at this 7 11 and
4023.4199999999996,4027.3399999999997," You know these dude would come in with guns, you know, they can give him the money and everything"
4027.3399999999997,4030.22," He was just like whatever, you know, I'm not taking a bullet for you know"
4030.22,4033.3399999999997, They got to the point where he did the register at the fucking door
4033.3399999999997,4036.1, We'll know well guys the point where you know they would come in and just be like what's up?
4036.1,4037.7, He'd like how they're going here's the money
4040.3399999999997,4042.3399999999997, You know you hear
4042.3399999999997,4045.3399999999997, And just hit like check on the catcher
4045.86,4051.9, And it's not so bad at one point. I guess they brought in like a moving truck and like took the arcade games
4056.9,4060.6600000000003, And you know like he was being he was like they thought he was in on it
4061.6600000000003,4065.1600000000003, Because they were so because they were able to come and take the
4066.1600000000003,4071.38, I think it like a dolly or something or they had like a mini fork lift in the back and they pull that down
4072.3,4074.94, He's like he's like giving him drinks in case they're sweating
4075.34,4077.34, Oh
4078.86,4083.9," Dude, I used to hate how like cops would come in a 7 11 working at 7 11 like cops always come in there because he have"
4083.9,4089.6400000000003, Compt Cups that you give cops like little like styrofoam cups and they come in their coax and and the coffee
4089.6400000000003,4093.08, It's worth your while because then for the 10 minutes that they're in there
4093.08,4097.34," You're not going to get held up. Yeah, but I was like, you know in the burbs or an Austin"
4097.34,4102.22," I worked in both places, but like once I had my guitar case in the back and you know"
4102.22,4108.02, Obviously like a little punk rocker guy who thought he was like badass like rebel and I had this bumper sticker on it
4108.02,4113.860000000001, That said shoot cops not heroin and the shop went back there and drink his coffee
4113.860000000001,4116.780000000001," And it's like who's guitars this and I'm like oh, you know"
4116.780000000001,4118.780000000001, I think that's somebody in the third shift
4120.900000000001,4127.02, Nice I said some friends who in in high school pulled their pickup truck to
4127.3,4132.120000000001, There's this chain used to be called teaching wine. They they pulled up the back of the truck to the front
4132.120000000001,4135.9800000000005, You know when they have all this little like bending machine things we put your quarters in and turn the crank
4135.9800000000005,4140.860000000001," And it's like a whole rack up with like a police yeah, and it did they just like"
4141.46,4143.820000000001, Pulled up their truck and threw that whole fucking thing
4143.820000000001,4149.64, The truck is drove away for the next week at school everyone had like three like plastic spiders and
4149.64,4151.64, Yeah
4156.240000000001,4158.4800000000005, So let's like before like we we
4160.12,4162.12, And for another moment
4162.12,4167.92," It's like like tick stock of all the game stuff we played I mean Robert you just saw well, there's a event last week"
4167.92,4173.72," It's a couple of us went to Robert another fine showing by yeah, I got to say you just"
4174.6,4177.64, Went on a boat cruise and saw the godfather part two
4178.280000000001,4180.280000000001," Yes, it's hard being a don"
4180.84,4186.240000000001, It's hard being a don we learn at the yay event that being a game designer so it was like being the don
4186.72,4193.72, That's really hard for me to see how that might be true to let's talk about godfather before we I
4193.72,4196.84," Don't you know, I don't know what's about godfather the event was like"
4197.360000000001,4204.400000000001, People hanging out on this yacht like a bunch of people that I never met before in the game industry and they had like this
4205.36,4211.58, This sort of a card game that they made that was supposed to tell you how the godfather
4212.16,4215.82, Strategy elements work. So he had just sit down and play this card game
4217.2,4224.12, Which is really like it's a weird environment to have to learn it in because they filled the boat with like
4225.04,4229.139999999999, Sort of like girls and slinky black dresses who would like bring you drinks and
4230.12,4234.32," Like a missus and all of these, you know"
4234.4,4239.48, Did you get a massage I didn't get a massage actually they had that's they they had that same setup at yay
4239.92,4242.24, I believe you I vouch for
4242.24,4245.759999999999, But I want it what's the big lesson you learned about about this boat trip though
4246.799999999999,4252.24," Well, you never want to go to a game event on a boat and that's why because you can't leave"
4253.839999999999,4256.96," Very good, but I thought of that never go to boat"
4256.96,4261.0199999999995, Sounds epic to sound so spoiled because I mean we're talking about look what we're describing
4261.02,4265.660000000001, You're going on a boat with a bunch of hot chicks and free like gambling and massages
4265.660000000001,4271.72, But what it what it misses out on is it's not it's work like it's not it doesn't feel like you're having a party
4271.72,4278.5, It feels like you're there with a bunch of dudes that you don't really want to talk to and you're gonna get like sold on a game for three hours
4278.5,4281.620000000001, Because every time someone comes up to you from the game company
4281.620000000001,4287.6, They're gonna want to harp on like the three bullet points that they're telling you about right and it's not it's not you're not there to have fun
4287.6,4290.0, You're there to work and I would rather just go to
4290.52,4295.44, Like an office and have the demo and learn about the game and go
4295.68,4300.96," Yeah, I don't make that doesn't work. Were you guys at fifth Davis one they had the the Christmas party on the boat?"
4301.36,4304.48," Yeah, were you there? Yeah, because that was a fucking nightmare"
4306.2,4309.28, But exactly amazing you couldn't leave you were stuck
4309.28,4313.56," You know at first thoughts it's the office Christmas party, right? I mean and of course"
4313.56,4318.32, If didn't let you bring your spouses because that's just the way Zifraals or your girlfriend's or whatever
4318.5599999999995,4321.679999999999, It's like holiday party. No you can't bring your family
4323.4,4331.04, So you know so I was on this boat and it was like first all freezing it was freezing outside and you know
4331.04,4338.04, And it was crowded inside so it's either like be with your sweaty coworkers inside or freeze outside and then
4338.42,4342.88, Like less than half way on the in the course of this trip
4342.88,4344.24, They ran out of food
4344.36,4348.62," Okay, so here's this party without food. Oh, and there was no like decent alcohol either"
4348.92,4354.32, So you're on this you're at this party with your workmates at night when you'd rather be home on a boat
4354.5199999999995,4356.84, It was freezing and there was no food
4357.16,4362.84, So we actually like went into the boats like storage compartment and found like packs of like chips
4362.84,4364.639999999999, Like 75
4364.639999999999,4371.36, Like ladies potato chips. I'm we're breaking them out like we've been you know shipwrecks like five days people like oh my god
4371.36,4373.36, Take a fucking potato chips
4374.24,4377.5, How many packs of you had you already had to give me that
4380.16,4384.08," And this is like our Christmas party. Oh, this is like thank you for working here"
4386.08,4389.2, You're also on the paper two hours two and we could go home
4389.2,4390.719999999999," Yeah, we couldn't go home"
4390.719999999999,4393.04, It was like when we didn't get land. Thank god
4395.12,4400.719999999999," That is so yeah, this was nothing like that so I've never gone to a boat party ever since ever since yeah"
4400.88,4405.6, But the game I think actually looks fairly interesting. I mean really I think it's a little bit
4406.6,4412.88, the pressing the me to see that like after you know there was a bit of a stink when they made the first game
4412.88,4415.6, Everyone was sort of like oh they got the godfather
4415.6,4421.280000000001," You know, are they really gonna be able to make a game that lit up to the godfather? Now it's like oh, hey"
4421.280000000001,4426.64, Come check out our new strategy crime game. It's called the godfather too. It's like godfather is now just like a brand
4426.72,4431.92, They got over the whole movie. There will be like 20 games that I guarantee you like right anything
4431.92,4436.08," You know, I know this I noticed when we were at yeah, and they did a yeah for this gamer stand"
4436.08,4440.96, They did a little video presentation that's when the guy said being a designer's like being a dawn
4441.4400000000005,4447.360000000001, And they started showing this trailer for godfather the music was like this like 60s James Bond music
4449.92,4451.92, That's father too like hello
4452.4800000000005,4455.52, They have like the most famous soundtrack and film fucking history
4456.72,4458.72, Where is it
4459.76,4461.76, They paid like how many millions for this license
4462.320000000001,4464.320000000001, They think it's like get smart music
4465.360000000001,4470.0, They don't they're not taking like the the visual cues from the movie like they did with the first one
4470.0,4475.200000000001, It's really bright saturated colors and it actually looks a lot more like the Scarface game from a couple years ago
4475.200000000001,4481.04," Yeah, yeah, right what's that? It's my amy if not there's my any Cuba and New York City"
4481.280000000001,4485.04," Okay, so and that makes sense because that's what the movie was set in"
4485.28,4491.5199999999995," Yeah, it doesn't have anything to do with godfather to the movie right or does it well? I think yeah, it does it does yeah"
4491.5199999999995,4496.08," Okay, I mean they're it's going to relay. I don't know how closely it's gonna relate"
4496.88,4499.76, I'm sure that they'll try to use key scenes. I mean that's what they did
4499.76,4504.96, I played through the original game and it was sort of like um you were like the forest gun right man
4505.36,4507.36, Like you
4507.76,4513.12, You like you like you like happened to pawn every famous right godfather just because you
4513.599999999999,4516.08, Just having to be this dude who is there no you're right
4516.08,4522.0, In fact aren't you the guy who um seriously you're the guy who like has to kill the horse you wielded black hand technology
4522.0,4526.24," You right? Oh, don't start that right now don't you bring though? I think bring the horse to the guys"
4526.24,4530.16," Yeah, yeah, I mean they do they come up with all these things where you're like the guy who's"
4530.5599999999995,4535.599999999999," Sort of behind the scenes. Yeah, they get all the roasting pants and gilding turn up. Yeah, but but like as a game"
4535.599999999999,4541.599999999999, What's interesting about it is I really enjoy open-world games that don't have like a strict mission structure
4541.84,4547.04, to where you can something like stalker where where you can just happen upon events and like
4547.68,4551.92, Approach things like like like a url like crackdown where you like go and you find that that one part of town
4551.92,4556.96, You got like lace-ege and and do something big and it's and it's really open-ended
4556.96,4562.8, I think they're trying to do a lot more interesting stuff and that regard here because it's like this open-ended
4563.120000000001,4571.4400000000005, Take over the city kind of game where you're competing against you know four five other families and you have all of the all of these sort of things
4571.44,4577.36, That you're disposal you have a associate's that you gain sort of RPG style you go around recruiting guys
4577.5199999999995,4581.04," You got to have money to recruit them, but once you do they have like"
4581.599999999999,4586.799999999999, Sort of attributes and powers that you can use against people you know some of them might have like
4587.2,4593.679999999999, Stealth kill abilities or like the ability to fire bomb a store or whatever you can sort of manipulate all these things
4594.5599999999995,4597.919999999999, As you're playing a more traditional like crime
4598.4,4601.76, You know open-world game and it looks like it could be pretty good
4602.0,4606.16, They should have your character from the first godfather game and make a joke of it like
4606.56,4611.36, Like he's the like that before he's where he ends up in every crew like you know if you get the fire brawl
4611.36,4616.16, Squat like that guy ends up with them somehow and then like every time you like that dude is there no matter
4616.72,4619.68," Yeah, who you're dealing with or like yeah"
4620.08,4624.0," He's just in there. All right, we shit god. They should just say hey. Let's have this guy do it"
4624.64,4626.64, Yeah
4626.96,4632.08, We got to play a little bit of a battlefield heroes at the EA event and waiting this week
4632.08,4637.4400000000005, We're getting like I think this evening we're getting our beta invites finally so we'll be talking about greater death
4637.76,4643.68, It's kind of difficult. I mean in these events we you there's a line of people you sit down with five minutes and then like they kind of like
4643.68,4649.12, Plightly indicate that okay your time is up like like someone else sit on it and it's like okay
4649.12,4653.12, What whatever but there's always some dead that was sitting there like he said is fucking arcade
4653.68,4654.88, You know in his neighborhood
4654.88,4656.88, To some fat ass
4656.88,4658.0, 25 men every
4658.0,4664.08," In the high yeah, yeah, and but I was able to see in that time that I mean it seems like they're really going all out now"
4664.08,4668.32, What the character customization stuff like even where it was at one point it seemed like
4669.4400000000005,4674.96, It was all within the sort of this like fiction that they're creating so it would be like soldier like gear
4675.52,4680.08, That that resembled that of the gear from the allies or the access from thing and now it's like it's gone
4680.08,4686.16," The so-called real-world where I mean you'd be wearing like a chicken wing for a hat or yeah, you know, I mean it's like it's just"
4686.72,4693.64," They're going out of the way to show the yeah a crazy shit and so yeah, I mean yeah, I a student that's what's going on"
4693.64,4697.04," Well, right they might as well and and that stuff is like"
4697.28,4702.48," Right now that stuff is proven so successful. You know, I just did this preview for crisis warhead and you know"
4702.48,4704.08, I got me thinking about
4704.08,4708.08, I'm I hadn't anticipated you asked me like two years ago what the trend in multiplayer shooters would be
4708.32,4710.96, It definitely seemed like everything was taking the battlefield direction
4711.28,4715.44, Then so many games did do that last season we had so many front lines and the UT three and
4716.08,4721.08, Quick wars and all these things and none of those like was a breakthrough crisis power struggle
4721.08,4723.24, Mood included and of course what is is called did you for
4724.04,4726.72, Team fortress and both of those games team fortress now
4726.72,4731.44, It's kind of been an afterthought. I'm not saying team fortress popular just because it has achievements and stuff
4731.44,4735.4, But I don't think it's hurt likewise for COD for it's a fantastic game
4735.4,4740.28, It's just they're also the simplicity and like the streamlining of those games is a huge part of that success
4740.759999999999,4745.12," But it's also proven popular people like to just keep playing so they can rank up, you know"
4745.12,4751.36, And like given that simple five battlefield to get people a ton of shit to keep playing for I mean
4751.36,4755.379999999999, It seems pretty one game like Call of Duty. I was wondering or even team fortress
4755.639999999999,4758.679999999999, What is what is the financial incentive to wanting
4759.48,4762.04, Players to continue to play when they're not paying like a
4762.04,4767.08, Meat for years. They do they they do sorry studying. They do sell map packs occasionally
4767.08,4769.72, And I have on on the 360 I've purchased
4769.96,4773.92, The map packs are $10 like they did over a million downloads of their $10 map pack
4773.92,4778.12, Which they made like $10 million off of something they didn't actually have to produce a physical like
4779.04,4782.12, Media for in the lawn what's a good question the recognition
4782.12,4788.68," No, well like look safe for what happened with the halo games right and people are playing your game from the time it comes out until the time the sequel comes out"
4789.64,4795.240000000001, Eventually they're people hearing them talking about it and they're like it just becomes a established in the pop of the mentality
4795.240000000001,4798.400000000001, And every subsequent sequel sells more and more because then people like all jump on now
4798.400000000001,4801.6, That's the gamer balloon plays. That's the one that if there's a sitcom on TV
4801.6,4803.16, That's the one the kids are playing in the background
4803.16,4809.88," That's the one that grandma knows the name of it. Yep. Yeah, I mean you just you build that kind of devotion that you know dedicated fan base"
4809.88,4816.92," And yeah, the name right we have a loan is is prices. I mean I don't know how many times in the last six months eight months where like"
4817.4400000000005,4822.4, You know other parents or like relatives who with with kids would say like
4822.92,4824.84, My son wants to scale
4824.84,4830.0, I need you to help me because you're the gamer in the family. It's some world war two thing and I got a call duty and
4830.4,4836.84, That's it every time and it was amazing that that game had achieved that kind of it. It hit that level
4836.84,4841.56," Yeah, yeah, the other thing is that you you persuade say there's someone who hasn't bought team fortress yet"
4841.56,4848.200000000001, Right maybe this is the month where like because that's what all their friends are still playing and they hear that there's all this new stuff out
4848.200000000001,4852.4800000000005," Then nobody at now so I mean they have a long tail on them and people yeah, I mean especially with team fortress"
4852.4800000000005,4855.04, It's a little bit mysterious to me because you get everything for free
4855.56,4859.72," Right, but I guess you know they keep they keep this buzz about it"
4859.72,4863.56, I mean I do see every fucking time there's any sort of update about team fortress
4863.56,4869.84, It's at the top of dig so I guess say it lots. Yep. You know the thing that was fucking weird for me about this whole like the order
4869.84,4875.84, Success of the games the orange box notably team fortress and portals that like I always I was always a team fortress classic
4875.84,4879.12, Player and I like this is like a group of people and you had this one thing for it
4879.12,4883.96, But then it became like it's like the freaks fucking stole it and like
4884.64,4887.96," I mean I don't mean that like we were well, we were in this case. It's like you know"
4887.96,4894.400000000001, It's just move hang it changed hands and and what I mean my freaks is it's like you see I mean people that like
4895.04,4901.639999999999," Just like a hen tie and anime type stuff, you know, we're like their drawn team fortress characters like having sex with each other and"
4901.96,4906.599999999999, Portal like getting like the shitty portal tattoos and you'll see like their web page and it's like you know
4906.599999999999,4910.0599999999995, It is when you go to some space in the internet and like it's just inscrutable to you
4910.0599999999995,4914.5199999999995, You just really have no understanding of like who's doing this like it's your soul
4914.759999999999,4916.759999999999, Yeah
4916.759999999999,4922.44, Stop that they they're doing is just so alien to you and like totally that that's the group that just
4922.719999999999,4926.24, Just grabbed a whole of both port and what you fortress to it's really weird
4926.639999999999,4929.96, You see all these like shitty comics and stuff with them in it and like
4930.36,4934.7, Maybe we talked about it before the whole like the cake is a lie thing and it's like I don't want to hear about the cake anymore
4934.7,4936.7, You know like
4938.36,4943.0, Just some extent I guess that's kind of another reason that valve keeps up the thing of that going though
4943.0,4947.639999999999, Because I know that they do pretty well with the merchandising for both the portal and team fortress to you
4947.879999999999,4949.919999999999," So I'm sure that doesn't hurt. Yeah, yeah"
4949.92,4956.04, You can get even more than that. I mean how many companion cubes can you sell that? I mean they always sell out of them as soon as they get them
4956.04,4959.72, They at this point is they could make a companion cube flesh light and I'm sure
4961.32,4966.52, Man right now someone someone is doing that right now because you just someone has done it already
4966.52,4973.72, At some point while had put companion cubes in they put like a little thing like a little sort of homage to the companion cube
4973.72,4983.8, There I still I still admire I still admire like how there were these strangely resonating things in that game that people just couldn't like go like the companion
4983.8,4988.96, The companion cube was really I don't know I I don't want to be too predictable because I always bring up like
4988.96,4994.96," Esperger's all the time, but I mean that's the case where I kind of wonder when someone tells you that they felt more for the companion"
4994.96,4998.8, You then they did for like you know the little sisters and bio-shock or whatever all these other
4998.8,5003.76," Alex and Half-Life. It's like yeah, you really got to wonder at that point. You know who said that though?"
5003.76,5005.64, I feel like the companion cube over no
5006.64,5012.12," I like that was funny. Yeah, it was a great joke, but I've seen that I felt nothing for doing it do some searching for it"
5012.12,5017.4400000000005," You know, I think he tattoos were all one guys arm. He'll have a companion cube and it says love and on the other"
5017.4400000000005,5021.92, There's a cake and it says lies beneath it. I mean it's pretty that it no
5022.92,5025.88, That's real people. I've had a said things to myself
5025.88,5030.56, I was looking through your Twitter page twilight. I like tattoos. Yeah Anthony thought about getting Star Wars 10
5031.84,5036.8, Actually he actually has it planned that he wants to get the symbol of the older public and the new republic on this forum
5038.16,5040.16, As a loser I
5040.16,5043.4800000000005, I would say right now so you don't fund that like trick
5044.68,5051.32, I don't pay the dude. He does I witnessed things to your thanks to your Twitter page a picture of some naked guy with bad
5051.32,5055.5599999999995," Tetsu is having sex with an ATAT whatever. Oh, yeah, it's not that too"
5057.12,5062.84, I'm never looked at Sean's Twitter page. It's good. It's actually you get it's probably the best aggregator
5062.84,5069.0, I knew of for a for like content for for pictures like I don't have the video is right now
5069.0,5073.679999999999," But it's like a lot in pictures. You need to go to my YouTube favorite for that. Yeah, yeah"
5073.679999999999,5076.679999999999, You say in your YouTube favorites are a better aggregator
5076.68,5081.200000000001," There are a repository of everything stupid you could want to see on the internet. Yeah, that sounds pretty good"
5081.200000000001,5086.56, I need I need stuff like that because I sort of don't have any like good places to pick up
5087.72,5089.740000000001, Stupid content for the internet right now
5089.740000000001,5095.12," That Sean is my whole conduit for that. Yeah, well, then I stopped it straight up because I just put it on on the Twitter"
5095.12,5099.280000000001, Now so like I've been so wait all those photos. You've been aiming me as had all the stuff that ends up on the Twitter
5099.280000000001,5102.320000000001, Some of those have been yeah everything like that like so yeah
5102.32,5106.54, I did aim you like that billboard with a says that look at there's a cop hiding behind there
5107.0199999999995,5109.219999999999, There is a cop hiding behind that billboard
5110.5199999999995,5111.5199999999995, That's where the
5111.5199999999995,5112.92, Slow down that's where they call it
5112.92,5114.92, It's where the cop
5114.92,5120.719999999999, That's great sometimes like a since I just started them and dating it with like all the classics well if we're if we're
5121.88,5126.24," Try it up. I think we should all go out. Wait wait. I got to read the thing. Yeah, I'm reading"
5126.24,5129.44, I got to read something to you from the campaign to you when we end yeah
5129.44,5131.44, He's volunteer to eat a mouthful no
5132.44,5136.5599999999995, I've been slumped into my chair because I've been seriously like feeling sick to my staff
5136.5599999999995,5142.639999999999," Yeah, I've had since you had that that pew quang was bad. How many can you put how many like all at once could you eat?"
5143.36,5150.08," They didn't look nauseating just look at those colors, especially the rotten egg of those colors are the rotten egg human color worst"
5150.08,5155.639999999999," Okay, go ahead and read okay, and right now get Robert a okay, so this was a this was a forwarded to me"
5156.280000000001,5159.400000000001," Today, this is from the campaign trail"
5159.84,5163.240000000001, This is actually a serious news item this comes from CNN
5164.56,5169.56, I guess a McCain and let me just preface this is not there's no political
5170.52,5174.280000000001, Angle here that I'm working here. I'm just saying this was in the news. Okay
5176.160000000001,5182.38, On the campaign trial I guess McCain has been telling the story about how when he was a POW and in a moment of
5182.38,5188.38," For like inspiration or whatever he drew across in the sand okay, and that that inspired him"
5188.5,5195.64, So after he told the story he's gotten some shit from the left saying that he actually swiped this story from Alexander
5195.64,5197.88, So it's a neat thing that he told the story about it
5198.54,5202.54, Before and that McCain told the story in a different context in another way
5202.54,5205.18, Basically that it's not true or implying that
5205.66,5212.06, That it might you know that he's fudging it. It's a version is to reciting like writing poems in his head in the
5212.06,5214.88," Google like well, there was some about a cross too. So anyway"
5215.660000000001,5219.9800000000005, McCain has an aid named Michael Goldfarb and on the on his website
5219.9800000000005,5223.580000000001, He has a blog and he wanted to comment on
5224.38,5228.22, The fact that the left was giving McCain shit for this. So here's what the sky wrote
5229.46,5231.46, In in response to this
5231.46,5236.42, quote it may be typical of the pro Obama Dungeons and Dragons crowd
5236.74,5241.74, To despairage of failed fellow countryman's memory of war from the comfort of moms basement
5242.3,5248.74, But most Americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
5248.74,5249.74, He wrote
5249.74,5253.66, It's a joke. It goes on like so what the fuck of this with both things
5254.54,5256.78, Bush and I mean this has nothing to do with
5257.34,5260.74, Republicans or Democrats or whatever like just the dunes. That's the angle he took
5261.06,5265.46, Like he was very acting like there's a whole like the spirit about the story and
5265.46,5270.22, He's saying he's calling the he's saying the pro Obama Dungeons and Dragons crowd
5270.22,5274.3, He might not even get that. I don't know he must be thinking like dig or something like that
5274.3,5280.6," Yeah, like pile onto a story like that and who also like the top story right underneath that is like new level of super Mario Bros"
5280.6,5282.6, Little areas
5282.6,5284.6, Obama's not a big fan of fourth edition
5286.94,5292.72, So actually they the Eplarch of that is just that apparently some a great D&D nerds
5293.280000000001,5298.18, Road you know spam the sky or sort of spam the McCain website and now
5298.18,5303.22, There's actually an apology up saying you know my apologies to all the hardworking Dungeons and Dragons fans
5304.84,5308.72, A lot of those D fans are also card carrying in our eight members and stuff
5308.72,5312.68," We'll see like Mac Tens and stuff. Yeah, that's the other part of it. You know the D fans"
5312.68,5317.18, I knew tend to be fairly conservative a lot of them. I just seemed like a weird like
5317.52,5320.8, How did you make that leap like I can see the speeding the story?
5321.04,5323.360000000001, Or disputing the
5323.360000000001,5328.1, Speeding the people disputing it. I can see that there'd be some controversy over whether this guy
5328.400000000001,5332.16," Whether McCain, you know what the origin of the sort of story is"
5332.400000000001,5340.08, But to that but to say it's a lump Dungeons and Dragons into the world like we way of saying we ought to touch with reality
5340.08,5342.6, But instead of like world of warcraft or something
5342.6,5348.3," Yeah, but you would say like how the Hollywood liberals or something some more like expect this is like mechanics"
5348.3,5353.820000000001," Criter so disconnected from the internet that they're they're whole like vision of it is like oh, it's those Dungeons and Dragons kids"
5356.820000000001,5358.820000000001," Yeah, okay"
5358.820000000001,5363.66, Robert I know your punishment for that political comment. We don't welcome on the show was to eat a handful
5363.66,5366.66," Yeah, it's a it's butter popcorn and rotten egg"
5366.66,5371.1," So I don't think I could do right nag. I could do yeah, you look"
5371.1,5373.1," Yeah, you look stuff and eat"
5373.1,5375.1, See you
5375.1,5379.54," Do it though, do it why Sean is because sometimes we get people to do that's a good mix"
5379.54,5382.18, That's okay sometimes it could make like a new slide
5382.18,5387.3, Skeeps as it's not cleaning up your vomit okay skip did bring us a lot of got like six of these
5388.3,5391.660000000001, He had molded his and they're on air hairy carry earwax

5397.18,5399.42, What are the odds that he got nothing but delicious flits?

5405.1,5409.06, It's a character and we walk at the start of turning colors and then blue berry
5409.06,5417.46," Huh, it's like Robert Ashley right now if I were an owner file I would say the I detect hints of black pepper the smell coming out of his mouth makes me want to"
5420.46,5422.46, Some some vomit
