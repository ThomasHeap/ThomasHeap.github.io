0.0,9.0," Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast. This is the podcast for November 29th, 2006."
9.0,17.0," This is Jeff Green, the editor in chief of Gaines-Fuendo Magazine, and I'm here with a slightly reduced editorial staff."
17.0,22.0, We're missing one member. We'll see if you smart readers can guess who it is. So who is here?
22.0,25.0," Ryan Scott, Dary Gladstone, and Sean Moloi."
25.0,27.0, So you figured out.
27.0,29.0, We have an MTC for Elijah.
29.0,36.0," Yeah, for internet superstar Sean Elliott is out today, because he's trying to arrange for a trip."
36.0,39.0, So he apologizes in advance for not being here.
39.0,45.0," And we're once again on a shortened schedule, and we won't blame those bastards at restaurants this time, even though we might as well."
45.0,46.0," Yeah, it's just that."
46.0,47.0, That is blame.
47.0,48.0, Always a fault bastards.
48.0,50.0, That's not their fault.
50.0,56.0, We actually have a special two special guests coming up in the second half of this podcast.
56.0,63.0," Ray and Greg from BioWare, the CEOs of BioWare, makers of Baldur's Gate 2,"
63.0,67.0," J.A.D. Empire, Couture, what else have they made?"
67.0,74.0," Never win or nights, and the upcoming Dragon Age, the cover story for our first issue of game so-and-as-max."
74.0,78.0," So they'll be joining us in about 25 minutes or so, 20 minutes."
78.0,79.0, Something like that.
79.0,83.0," So hang on for that if you don't like us, and you like Ray and Greg, wait for them."
83.0,84.0, We're just skipping it.
84.0,85.0, Fast forward 20 minutes.
85.0,86.0, Yeah.
86.0,91.0," If we sound 20, it's because we had to quickly move all the podcast and equipment into someone's corner office."
91.0,98.0," Yeah, we're actually sitting in the office of some dude for, it's the PC magazine editor and chief, right?"
98.0,99.0, I think so.
99.0,100.0, Isn't that just a new title?
100.0,101.0, Yep.
101.0,106.0," And I gotta say, he doesn't have that impressive of an office for being the head of like a flagships"
106.0,108.0, if Davis magazine.
108.0,110.0," I mean, no offense to the guy, but really."
110.0,112.0, I think he worked out of a virtual reality helmet.
113.0,120.0," I think he's got some secret, like second office somewhere that's got like the girls feeding him grapes and the spa or whatever because this thing is kind of a dump."
124.0,126.0," Anyway, so we're here."
126.0,127.0, I'm back.
127.0,135.0," I'm completely exhausted because I've just spent two days in Boston seeing Ironmore, the makers of Titan Quest."
135.0,138.0, And so I'm like jet lagged and tug and exhausted.
138.0,141.0, So I'm gonna stop talking in one second.
142.0,143.0, One.
143.0,146.0," But I was, I was really excited to see that expansion."
146.0,150.0," Actually, I have to say, and I'm not just saying that because I'm kissing their ass."
150.0,152.0, They'll maybe I am a little.
152.0,157.0, But because I thought that that game was kind of underappreciated.
157.0,158.0, What did we give it?
158.0,159.0, Do you remember?
159.0,161.0," Oh, was that during our scoreless era?"
161.0,164.0," I mean, we don't think we gave it an editor choice."
164.0,165.0, We didn't.
165.0,166.0, No.
166.0,167.0, It felt just shy.
167.0,168.0, I think.
168.0,172.0," It's really, it's sort of, I was thinking as I was playing through it again."
172.0,177.0," This, uh, this weekend in preparation for this trip that is probably the first."
177.0,180.0, The Ablo clone quote unquote that Axie.
180.0,183.0, Probably was worthy of not being called that.
183.0,186.0," You know, it seemed to me like good on its own right."
186.0,188.0, Every other one sort of pale in the in the.
188.0,191.0, It was like lived in the shadow of the Ablo.
191.0,197.0, But do you think the reason why that is because only because it's been like so long since the Ablo two came out?
197.0,198.0," Well, I think that's part of it."
198.0,206.0," But I think that they also like sort of got that magic gameplay formula right where like everybody always tries to get that, you know,"
206.0,212.0," Karrton stick, loot monster level up thing and they never quite get what the Ablo got."
212.0,219.0, But these guys did it and they did it because they made the loot mechanism interesting for one thing.
219.0,226.0," They made the loot like the only loot that drives this loot that like these guys, these monsters would actually wear, right?"
226.0,231.0, So there was that thing and then they had all the interesting charm on a diggy guess play this game.
231.0,235.0," Oh yeah, yeah, but all the charm stuff the way you can enhance your armor."
235.0,240.0," There was just different, they found different ways to make this basic mechanic cool."
240.0,246.0," I think my favorite power up as a defender was being able to turn into a Titan or whatever it was like you basically you uh,"
246.0,249.0," It was a special ability to unlock later on where you can like, I didn't get that far."
249.0,251.0, It's like it's like it's one of the Uber skills.
251.0,256.0," Huh, you could like grow to like basically like dwarf the screen and just come like pressure anyone."
256.0,258.0, It sounds like final fantasy or something.
258.0,260.0, I'm trying to.
260.0,263.0," Um, so that's what I've been playing and that's what I've been doing."
263.0,264.0, Alright.
264.0,265.0, How about you guys?
265.0,267.0, I've been playing even online.
267.0,269.0, And you actually were playing it.
269.0,270.0, Actually.
270.0,271.0, Yeah.
271.0,273.0, I'm not making that joke.
273.0,275.0," Yeah, yeah, I'm still playing it right now."
275.0,277.0," No, no, no, no."
277.0,279.0," No, but you actually it'll get."
281.0,285.0," But you're all responding because you can get a Wii so you're just uh, I was yeah."
285.0,289.0," I actually almost took the money that I was going to spend on a Wii and bought a new um,"
289.0,291.0, You processor with it.
291.0,293.0," Oh, but I guess it'll frustrated."
293.0,294.0, I came real close.
294.0,295.0, You're just coming down.
295.0,296.0, But you didn't.
296.0,297.0, I didn't.
297.0,298.0, You didn't buy the new processor.
298.0,300.0, You're still holding out for the Wii.
300.0,301.0, Yeah.
301.0,302.0, Bastard.
302.0,303.0, There it is.
303.0,304.0, I'm working on a console magazine or something.
304.0,305.0, Maybe I will.
305.0,307.0," Oh, show."
307.0,308.0, Don't.
308.0,309.0, Don't.
309.0,312.0, So why the e-von line still.
312.0,313.0, Why.
313.0,314.0, It's it's cool.
314.0,315.0, It's not.
315.0,316.0, It's not.
316.0,317.0, It's not.
317.0,318.0, You're stupid.
318.0,319.0, Wow.
319.0,322.0," Well, angry angry man."
322.0,323.0, I got.
323.0,324.0, I got it.
324.0,326.0, Everybody likes the wow games.
326.0,328.0," They like the, you know,"
328.0,329.0, the loot.
329.0,331.0, He likes the monsters.
331.0,334.0, All that stuff that you kind of just talked about with Titan Quest.
334.0,335.0, I like that.
335.0,336.0, I don't want to kind of want to.
336.0,338.0, You're basically game mechanics.
338.0,339.0, There's no.
339.0,340.0, Are you doing this?
340.0,341.0, There's a course.
341.0,343.0, The Pavlovian Bell Regan doesn't work for Ryan.
343.0,344.0, He's above that.
344.0,345.0, You can.
345.0,346.0," I mean, you, there's space."
346.0,348.0, You can't loot if you must.
348.0,352.0," But there's, you know, there's other ways to get from point A to point B."
352.0,354.0," You know, what do you do then?"
354.0,355.0, What were you doing?
355.0,359.0," There's like, well, the thing that I've been doing is I've been working like the economy."
359.0,360.0," Oh, there's like this."
360.0,363.0, There's like this whole huge complicated sort of market.
363.0,364.0, And you.
365.0,367.0," You know, I, but if."
367.0,368.0, Answer the question.
368.0,369.0, If I went over here.
369.0,371.0," If I went over to your house,"
371.0,374.0," say, hey, did I'm playing Eve online right now?"
374.0,375.0, And I came over.
375.0,376.0, What would I see you doing?
376.0,378.0, What's going on in your screen?
378.0,379.0, I go over here.
379.0,381.0, And I buy things for a really cheap price.
381.0,384.0, And then I go over here and sell them for a really high price.
384.0,385.0," You know, you know, this is called the stock market."
385.0,387.0, You can actually make real money doing the exact same thing.
387.0,388.0, It's like going to eBay.
388.0,389.0, Yeah.
389.0,390.0, I'm like a game.
390.0,391.0, But.
391.0,392.0, Hello.
393.0,394.0, I'm not risking trading real.
394.0,396.0, I guess.
396.0,398.0," I mean, but well, you could do that in wild too, right?"
398.0,400.0," I mean, you could play your auction house or whatever."
400.0,401.0," But like, like."
401.0,403.0," So is that what you're doing, basically?"
403.0,406.0, Is this like an auction house mechanism or is that the game?
406.0,408.0," Like, are you doing the space coming by stuff?"
408.0,412.0," I haven't really gotten into the space combat outside of like,"
412.0,414.0," like, something in PCs."
414.0,416.0," I tried a little bit of it, but it was."
416.0,419.0, Isn't that like mostly what people do or no?
419.0,420.0, Some people do.
420.0,422.0," Some people don't ever touch that stuff, though."
422.0,424.0," There's like, you can."
424.0,426.0, You can do the market thing.
426.0,429.0," You can go and mine, which is."
429.0,434.0, Mine work your basic boring trade skill sort of thing.
434.0,435.0, Mine.
435.0,436.0, Mine.
436.0,437.0, Mine.
437.0,439.0, Or I'm a laser at least like a green laser.
439.0,440.0, It looks really cool.
440.0,441.0, There's lasers.
441.0,443.0, I can't wait to play this.
443.0,444.0, Make it.
444.0,445.0, That's a great.
445.0,447.0, It's a very slow.
447.0,449.0, It's a lot slower than a game like.
449.0,450.0," Wow, is."
450.0,453.0," You know, you have to, there's more of a learning curve to it."
453.0,457.0, I prefer my game slow and boring.
457.0,459.0, So good game.
459.0,462.0, Good game when she get into it.
462.0,464.0," What, what is it about?"
464.0,465.0, I don't mean the press.
465.0,466.0, I do mean the press one.
466.0,467.0, What?
467.0,469.0, What is it about this one?
469.0,474.0," That is getting you to keep coming back over, over all the other MMOs."
475.0,478.0," The amount, the comparative amount of freedom."
478.0,481.0, Do you like it to ultimate online?
481.0,482.0, Yeah.
482.0,486.0," That's exactly like, you know, with a game like, wow."
486.0,488.0, Or everquest or whatever.
488.0,490.0," When you go into the game, you're like, okay."
490.0,491.0, I want to find something to do.
491.0,495.0, I'm going to go talk to one of these dudes with the exclamation point on his head.
495.0,497.0, I'm going to go do a quest.
497.0,499.0, Or I'm going to go fish.
499.0,501.0, Like that's what there is to do.
501.0,502.0, Fishings fun.
502.0,505.0," I mean, you know, like that's something."
505.0,508.0, That you fish where the little swirly things are.
508.0,510.0, You get special things.
510.0,511.0, Right.
511.0,513.0, The objectives are all built in for you.
513.0,514.0, Right.
514.0,517.0," They're basically telling you, here's where you need to go and hear something."
517.0,518.0, Yeah.
518.0,520.0, You're the game like you've got earth and online.
520.0,522.0," Well, earth and online."
522.0,524.0, Out was.
524.0,528.0," You can, you know, you log in and you kind of make your own fun."
528.0,529.0, Yeah.
529.0,530.0," It's, you know."
530.0,531.0, Yeah.
531.0,532.0, Right.
532.0,533.0, Right.
533.0,534.0," I mean, wow."
534.0,537.0, It's essentially like a really nice amusement park where everything is all set up for you.
537.0,538.0, But I like that.
538.0,539.0, But I do.
539.0,540.0, Yeah.
540.0,542.0, I get kind of opportunity paralysis.
542.0,543.0, Like if I don't have a goal.
543.0,547.0," I kind of stand there and going, uh, right."
547.0,548.0, I guess I'll go.
548.0,549.0, I don't know to do this.
549.0,550.0, Right.
550.0,551.0, Right.
551.0,552.0, That was always to me.
552.0,553.0, That was the barrier.
553.0,554.0, I couldn't get over with the very first.
554.0,556.0, Emma was a came out.
556.0,559.0," It's like you'd log in and you just be like, well, what the hell do I do now?"
559.0,560.0, Yeah.
560.0,562.62," But I do have to say that when I went back to, uh, ever"
562.62,567.72," quest one when I was writing that story on it for the last issue, I went back in and I created"
567.72,571.16," a level in character and, um, what?"
571.16,573.08, Because I wanted to go through the newbie experience again.
573.08,579.12," And they've now retrofitted the whole newbie experience in E.K.1 in light of, wow."
579.12,584.0," So now that walky through this whole quest thing, you know, basically like for the first six levels"
584.0,587.0, or there's always people giving you stuff to do and whatever.
587.0,591.8," And I was weirdly, it's totally hypocritical, but I was weirdly like disappointed that they"
591.8,592.8, did that.
592.8,597.0," Like, I don't know why, just because they're trying to be like, wow, sort of."
597.0,598.0, Yeah.
598.0,600.0, I never quest wasn't wow.
600.0,602.0," So that was, yeah."
602.0,603.0," Yeah, I know what you mean."
603.0,607.0," Because I did the same thing when I used to play a request, I would have, I would go in"
607.0,612.28," and part of the excitement was, you know, not exactly knowing what I'd be walking into"
612.28,616.0, or if I'd be dying in the two seconds if I walked into that cave over there exactly.
616.0,620.0," Wow, you just know, it's like, okay, that's not, or it's supposed to be right now."
620.0,621.0, Right.
621.0,626.0, We talked about that a little bit on the podcast that we have with Jeff Butler from
626.0,631.0," Citral, you know, the part of the appeal of E.K. and Ultima Online in all those games back"
631.0,635.0, in the day was that there really was a sense of danger and of the unknown.
635.0,636.0, That's what I like.
636.0,637.0," Yeah, I can see that."
638.0,639.0, Have you been pKed and you've yet?
639.0,640.0, I haven't yet.
640.0,641.0, Of course.
641.0,643.0," Well, it's because you're traveling in the save zones."
643.0,645.0," You can't be pKed in the auction house, can you?"
645.0,647.0," Well, the way it works in the bank."
647.0,654.0," There's different solar systems and he has a security rating and the higher it is, the"
654.0,655.0, more NPC protection.
655.0,656.0, Okay.
656.0,659.0," So, and there's areas of just, you know, wild space there."
659.0,660.0, Is it all pK?
660.0,663.0," I mean, is it all sorry, ppbb?"
663.0,665.0, It outside of those security zones.
665.0,666.0," Yeah, you can be attacked."
666.0,667.0, Uh-huh.
667.0,668.0, You're kind of at the mercy of whoever's.
668.0,670.0," Okay, you can get your shit stolen too."
670.0,671.0," Oh, yeah."
671.0,672.0, Yeah.
672.0,674.0," So, the feeling ppb just play as pirates."
674.0,675.0, They can kill you.
675.0,676.0, You can kill you.
676.0,677.0," Yeah, there are people who just do that."
677.0,678.0," And you don't get it back, right?"
678.0,680.0, You just should that alok.
680.0,681.0, Sorry.
681.0,682.0," Well, you can."
682.0,685.0," You can, you can buy insurance contracts on your ships."
685.0,686.0, Uh-huh.
686.0,691.0," So, there's a lot of ways that you can customize them though."
691.0,694.0," And you lose all that when you, when you, um, if you lose your ship."
694.0,695.0, But you can.
696.0,702.0," I wonder, you know, it seems like this kind of games always going to just be for hard core"
702.0,703.0," days, right?"
703.0,704.0, Yeah.
704.0,705.0," I mean, it's that sort of an obvious point."
705.0,706.0, Yeah.
706.0,708.0," Well, I think if they have like different, like the way Ryan's describing it, there's like a"
708.0,711.0," a save zone where you can kind of, that's a safe little sandbox."
711.0,712.0, You could do whatever you want to please.
712.0,713.0, Right.
713.0,715.0," And then once you step into that larger world, then it becomes like the"
715.0,717.0, Uber hardcore like way.
717.0,719.0," But don't you think, I mean, who's going to play it?"
719.0,720.0, Isn't going to want to ever.
720.0,725.0," The thing is, no, and you just want to stick to those like civilized secure areas of space."
725.0,728.0, And you want that to be air and higher experience long term.
728.0,729.0, You can do that.
729.0,730.0, But is there a fun enough game to do that?
730.0,731.0, Yeah.
731.0,732.0," I mean, it's."
732.0,736.0," It would be like playing like, you know, like, type hand back in the day or some like old school"
736.0,738.0, just trading sim and kind of games.
738.0,743.0," If you want to play it that way, then you, if that continues to be fun for you for months"
743.0,747.0," on end, I don't see how that wouldn't be viable."
747.0,748.0, Yeah.
748.0,754.0," But like the whole, the whole game world, there's like the center of it is all secure."
754.0,759.0," And then as you go further out, I just saw a map of the game the other night that had it was like"
759.0,763.0, on a political map where it shows like all the outer regions of space are all owned by
763.0,768.0," these specific player alliances, who are like a war with each other and stuff."
768.0,775.0," And from what I understand, once you get out there into those player police alliances, it's actually"
775.0,779.0, fairly safe for you to kind of live there.
779.0,783.0, As long as you join one of the alliances and you're not multiple servers or anything as
783.0,786.0," a result, all one huge world."
786.0,787.0, Yeah.
787.0,788.0, That's kind of appealing to.
788.0,789.0, Interesting.
789.0,790.0, Yeah.
790.0,791.0, That's really nice.
791.0,793.0, We're talking a lot about Eva Online.
793.0,795.0, We like to talk a lot about Eva Online.
795.0,797.0, This episode spots.
797.0,800.0," In fact, if you took the sum total of all our podcasts, you've got the same"
800.0,802.0, property ranks way up there.
802.0,808.0," And they actually yesterday, they just patch in some new expansion material that gives"
808.0,811.0, better newbie experience better tutorial.
811.0,814.0," Yeah, see, we, we, we, we, that's the beginning of the end."
814.0,815.0, Yeah.
815.0,816.0, All right.
816.0,817.0, Don't thumb it down for the newbies.
817.0,821.0," Well, the thing, like, when you create a character and even if you don't know anything about"
821.0,826.0," what you're doing, it's very easy, or it used to be very easy to make a lot of choices and not really"
826.0,828.0, realize the impact of my problem was just there.
828.0,831.0," That tutorial went on for two damn long, you know."
831.0,832.0, Yeah.
832.0,833.0, Let me play your game already.
833.0,834.0, I get it.
834.0,837.0," You know, and like you could not out of it, could you?"
837.0,838.0, You had to like keep going.
839.0,842.0," You could skip to the very end, but you could."
842.0,845.0," I mean, you would be sort of lost in a lot of ways if you didn't go through it."
845.0,847.0," Oh, but I thought that's what it's all about Ryan."
847.0,848.0, Ah.
848.0,850.0, Okay.
850.0,851.0, Enough.
851.0,852.0, All right.
852.0,853.0, Enough.
853.0,854.0," Anybody, please."
854.0,855.0," Well, two things."
855.0,859.0," One is a demo that came through the office recently, and they left the disc me to play with."
859.0,860.0, It's called Silverfall.
860.0,861.0," Oh, right."
861.0,862.0, It's an action RPG.
862.0,864.0, It actually looks really cool.
864.0,865.0, I'm going to make this game.
865.0,870.0," It's monochristo games out of, uh, I want to save France."
870.0,871.0," Oh, boy."
871.0,872.0," Hey, you know what?"
872.0,874.0," Actually, it's got an interesting style to it."
874.0,876.0, It actually looks pretty interesting style.
876.0,877.0, Yeah.
877.0,879.0, It has a nice personality.
879.0,882.0," Well, though, I mean, as far as like,"
882.0,885.0, the world itself seems kind of interesting.
885.0,886.0, Are there elves?
886.0,887.0, Of course.
887.0,888.0, And there are orcs.
888.0,889.0, Okay.
889.0,890.0, It's an action RPG.
890.0,891.0," I mean, like, but I think it doesn't."
891.0,893.0, It has more of an art.
894.0,897.0," I don't want to say will or work craft kind of art style to it,"
897.0,900.0, but it definitely doesn't feel like something that you see all the time.
900.0,901.0, Are they French orcs?
901.0,902.0, Yes.
902.0,904.0," They were very, johnty berets."
904.0,905.0, Just off.
905.0,906.0, Thank you.
906.0,907.0, Thank you.
907.0,908.0, I would hit you.
908.0,909.0, No.
909.0,914.0," No, but um, so do you fight things and do stuff?"
914.0,915.0, Yes.
915.0,917.0, That sounds like a very unique game.
917.0,918.0, Thank you.
918.0,919.0, Thank you very much.
919.0,921.0," No, uh, what I, what I appreciate about it is,"
921.0,924.0," like when you're developing, basically as the game progresses,"
924.0,928.0," you can choose between the nature or technology as your character evolves,"
928.0,931.0, and that a whole bunch of other abilities kind of revolve around that.
931.0,935.0," So it's like, you can go to the spell cast and route or you can go to the steam punk inside of the"
935.0,937.0, sounds like arcane them exactly.
937.0,939.0," There's like the flavors of arcane them in there, but it's."
939.0,941.0, It's worth trying out.
941.0,944.0," I mean, it's just, I was always, I've always been a huge fan of action RPGs."
944.0,948.0," And it kind of felt like after Diablo 2 and we're just kind of ate that for a while,"
948.0,950.0," and then just kind of said, okay, we're done."
950.0,953.0, And then we're done doing it any better except type of.
953.0,956.0," And then type of quest comes along and I think the, and I guess to a degree,"
956.0,959.0," I mean, I, uh, Helgates going to, you know, try to bring that back to."
959.0,960.0, Right.
960.0,963.0, Does there any love for Dungeon Siege in this group here in this room?
963.0,965.0, I really tried actually know what the game is.
965.0,966.0, Fairly play.
966.0,967.0, I tried to do it.
967.0,970.0," I really tried the PSP version is actually pretty good, but because it,"
970.0,973.0," where's the PC version actually, it's kind of funny in the piece in the,"
973.0,977.0," in the, there's actually between the PC version of Dungeon Siege 2 and the PSP version,"
977.0,979.0, and then there's a little thing like you trade a code back and forth.
979.0,981.0, That unlock stuff in both games.
981.0,982.0, That's kind of neat.
982.0,983.0, I guess.
983.0,985.0, I don't know what it was about Dungeon Siege.
985.0,987.0, It was just kind of like no soul in that game.
987.0,988.0, I think that was my problem.
988.0,990.0, It was like a gigantic tech demo.
990.0,991.0, Yeah.
991.0,993.0, It's not really generic right from the beginning.
993.0,994.0, Yeah.
994.0,997.0," Like, I mean, that was like the first game that had the streaming levels."
997.0,1001.0," So you never had a load time when you went from one, like,"
1001.0,1003.0," outdoor, or into a dungeon."
1003.0,1004.0, Thanks.
1004.0,1005.0, Wasn't it the first?
1005.0,1006.0," It was, it was one of my wrong."
1006.0,1009.0," I don't remember because like I, I, I was like,"
1009.0,1013.0, there a big show off thing when that was like skeletons would follow you outside of a dungeon and keep chasing you.
1013.0,1014.0, Yeah.
1014.0,1015.0, Like I missed this stuff.
1015.0,1020.0," But other than that, I just remember so many things about it just being utterly dull."
1020.0,1022.0," And like all the NPCs that were with you,"
1022.0,1024.0, it's like you could basically like not play that game.
1024.0,1026.0, It's like another e-bond line.
1026.0,1027.0, Yeah.
1027.0,1028.0," I think it would just like, sorry."
1028.0,1031.0, Don't be hate.
1031.0,1033.0," No, it really, it was kind of lame."
1033.0,1036.0, I guess because it just felt like it was an autopilot the whole time.
1036.0,1037.0," Like, you're here."
1037.0,1038.0, Yeah.
1038.0,1039.0, Yeah.
1039.0,1041.0, There was no personality to your characters.
1041.0,1042.0, Yeah.
1042.0,1043.0, Yeah.
1043.0,1044.0, That was kind of a big problem.
1044.0,1046.0, We don't need to randomly back on dungeons.
1046.0,1047.0, I thought it was going to be bad.
1047.0,1048.0, I know.
1048.0,1049.0, Okay.
1049.0,1050.0, So it was like every fast.
1050.0,1051.0, Well.
1051.0,1052.0, Okay.
1052.0,1053.0, Let me see.
1053.0,1054.0," Also, I was doing a lot of like hardware installations."
1054.0,1055.0, We can't.
1055.0,1056.0, I was playing with Windows Vista.
1056.0,1059.0, So we have the gold masters and we got a couple of gold masters in the office.
1059.0,1060.0, Yeah.
1060.0,1061.0, Woo.
1061.0,1062.0, Yeah.
1062.0,1063.0, Yeah.
1063.0,1064.0, That's a podcast.
1064.0,1065.0, And games for Windows.
1065.0,1066.0, Yeah.
1066.0,1067.0, I'm sorry.
1067.0,1070.0, It's good to repeat everything.
1070.0,1071.0, Yeah.
1071.0,1072.0," You know, it's."
1072.0,1074.0, Every once in a while just to make sure we still have jobs.
1074.0,1076.0, We'll slow that into the podcast.
1076.0,1078.0," Well, got what a great platform."
1078.0,1080.0, Let me dump on it now.
1080.0,1081.0," No, no."
1081.0,1082.0," You know, actually it's."
1082.0,1083.0, It's.
1083.0,1084.0, It's nice.
1084.0,1085.0, It works.
1085.0,1086.0," I mean, it's nice."
1086.0,1087.0, It's super nice.
1087.0,1088.0, It's a first review.
1088.0,1089.0, It's nice.
1089.0,1090.0, It's going to be a great.
1090.0,1091.0, It's going to be a great personality.
1091.0,1092.0, Yeah.
1092.0,1096.0," No, I honestly, I think that the people who are going to benefit most from it are going to be people"
1096.0,1102.0," who aren't us people who like reaching out to new people who don't play games or I've always been curious about it,"
1102.0,1103.0, but intimidated by the.
1103.0,1104.0," Oh, my God."
1104.0,1105.0, What about systems specs?
1105.0,1108.0," Well, this computer works for it."
1108.0,1111.0," But as far as my initial test so far, I mean, like it was easy."
1111.0,1115.0, After a minor stumbling block with hardware issues.
1115.0,1116.0, Works.
1116.0,1117.0, It's the full on Vista.
1117.0,1119.0, Full on direct X 10.
1119.0,1122.0," Well, I mean, like, it's all in there, but the thing is like, you know, there's nothing taking advantage of it."
1122.0,1123.0, Yeah.
1123.0,1124.0, Yeah.
1124.0,1125.0, Yeah.
1125.0,1128.0," Except for maybe purple place and chest titans, whatever."
1128.0,1129.0, The chest titans.
1129.0,1130.0," No, no, no."
1130.0,1131.0, Chest.
1131.0,1132.0," Oh, chest titans."
1132.0,1133.0, I'm sorry.
1133.0,1134.0, That's a different vary.
1134.0,1135.0, I'm thinking to say that.
1135.0,1137.0," Actually, I have that."
1137.0,1138.0, I have that on my favorite.
1138.0,1139.0," Like, Mark."
1139.0,1140.0, I saw that on cinema.
1140.0,1141.0, I saw that on cinema.
1141.0,1144.0, I saw that on cinema.
1144.0,1146.0," But, you know, I mean, my initial test or, you know, it's nice."
1146.0,1148.0, They are throwing in like the trend of throwing more competitively.
1148.0,1150.0, Options for dos games.
1150.0,1152.0, But I still can get crusader to play.
1152.0,1154.0, So that's that kind of sucks.
1154.0,1156.0," Yeah, boy, that's like the holy grail, right?"
1156.0,1157.0, Yeah.
1157.0,1158.0, That for me is like trying to climb out of ever.
1158.0,1159.0," It's like, why is that?"
1159.0,1160.0, I don't know.
1160.0,1161.0, Crusader.
1161.0,1162.0, No remorse.
1162.0,1163.0, Crusader.
1163.0,1164.0, No remorse.
1164.0,1166.0, It's like the classic game that will not play.
1166.0,1167.0, It absolutely refuses to work.
1167.0,1168.0, Yeah.
1168.0,1169.0," It's like, you know, you mean that one?"
1169.0,1170.0, Yeah.
1170.0,1171.0, Yeah.
1171.0,1172.0, Yeah.
1172.0,1173.0, The closest I'll ever get to play that on my computer.
1173.0,1175.0, I actually just copied all the files onto the hard drive.
1175.0,1176.0, Yeah.
1176.0,1177.0, Yeah.
1177.0,1178.0, I don't think it's ever played under any version of it.
1178.0,1181.0, Never played on XP and never played on Windows 95.
1181.0,1182.0, What's it doing?
1182.0,1183.0," Oh, wait."
1183.0,1184.0, Or was it a Windows 95 game?
1184.0,1185.0, No.
1185.0,1186.0, It was a dos game.
1186.0,1187.0, Was a dos game?
1187.0,1188.0, Yeah.
1188.0,1190.0, I tried rolling it back until like playing to win 95 compatibility.
1190.0,1191.0, Right.
1191.0,1192.0, And still doesn't.
1192.0,1193.0, Yeah.
1193.0,1194.0, That never works.
1194.0,1195.0, No.
1195.0,1196.0," Well, the thing is they're trying."
1196.0,1198.0," I mean, I was hoping that they would have done like more with it."
1198.0,1202.0, They went through the trouble of throwing in this whole extra tab in the properties menu.
1202.0,1204.0, When you like want to load up a dos game or something.
1204.0,1207.0, Why don't they just integrate dos box box?
1207.0,1208.0, That's what I was saying.
1208.0,1210.0," Why not just like, you know, like it's done before the works."
1210.0,1211.0, Yeah.
1211.0,1212.0, Yeah.
1212.0,1213.0, What could they couldn't buy them?
1213.0,1214.0, So they just.
1214.0,1215.0, I don't know.
1215.0,1216.0, It's just been sore.
1216.0,1217.0, I just like just license it.
1217.0,1218.0, Okay.
1218.0,1219.0, So my burning question to you is.
1219.0,1220.0, Yes.
1220.0,1224.0," Like, let's say that I didn't work here and wasn't probably going to get a copy for free."
1224.0,1225.0, Mm-hm.
1225.0,1226.0, Would I want to buy one?
1226.0,1228.0, Would I want to buy this to?
1228.0,1230.0," Well, I mean, I think the real question is."
1230.0,1231.0, Are you buying it right now?
1231.0,1232.0, Right now.
1232.0,1237.0," Like buying a PS3 now, which we all know would have been a completely moronic thing."
1237.0,1241.0, What would buying this to be equally moronic at launch at launch?
1241.0,1246.0," Well, I mean, traditionally speaking, a lot of stuff has doesn't get fixed until"
1246.0,1250.0," SP1 or 2, but I haven't run any major glaring issues."
1250.0,1255.0," And like I said, like a lot of the stuff is it's going to be more of a benefit to people who just kind of like are kind of"
1255.0,1259.0, perferially interesting game or want to get into it or want to make the process simpler.
1259.0,1261.0," I guess for us, it's going to be the dex 10 thing, right?"
1261.0,1262.0, That's it.
1262.0,1265.0," And we don't even, we can't even really see that in full effect yet."
1265.0,1266.0, Yeah.
1266.0,1272.0," So I mean, like if you're looking for some initial holy crap on day one, I mean, like you're going to see the arrow interface that looks kind of neat and frosty,"
1272.0,1275.0," really dex, very OS X-ish."
1275.0,1276.0, Right.
1276.0,1279.0," But other than that, I mean, it's, it's very streamlined."
1279.0,1280.0, It's nice.
1280.0,1283.0," Actually, there are a couple of cool, like minor little things."
1283.0,1285.0, Like the gaming explorer interface.
1285.0,1289.0, It has everything you need to do inside of this one window.
1289.0,1291.0, It seems kind of silly and frivolous.
1291.0,1298.0," But when you load up when you go on the icon for company heroes and it pulls your system says,"
1298.0,1302.0," okay, you're, you have a good CPU, good RAM, good enough hard drive space."
1302.0,1304.0, Your system rates a five.
1304.0,1306.0, And this game requires this much to run.
1306.0,1308.0," And then there's a link, actually."
1308.0,1310.0," Oh, this is the one you first put in the disc for the first time."
1310.0,1312.0," Well, no, actually, like after you've installed it."
1312.0,1313.0," Oh, okay."
1313.0,1315.0, Shouldn't you know this before you bought the game?
1315.0,1316.0, You think.
1316.0,1320.0," But I mean, theoretically this could work with demos and like anything else too."
1320.0,1324.0," So I mean, like after a game you already own sure, but I mean, and of course,"
1324.0,1328.0," they're going to have to like, the problem I actually, I raised this question of the Microsoft guys is imagine,"
1328.0,1331.0," like, I have a system that's technically like a five, like,"
1331.0,1332.0, Pimp in system right now.
1332.0,1333.0, Right.
1333.0,1336.0," And then five months, six months, no, no, no, it'll probably be downgraded to a four or five."
1336.0,1340.0, And they have to like change the compatibility of each game.
1340.0,1342.0," You know, basically the performance level each game."
1342.0,1344.0, So let's just keep adding numbers.
1344.0,1345.0," Well, that's the update update."
1345.0,1350.0," They update their database all the time and say, okay, now what once was a game that required a level five computer,"
1350.0,1352.0, can you have work with a level two computer?
1352.0,1353.0, Okay.
1353.0,1357.0," No, but I mean, they could just keep the levels and then every time something new comes out,"
1357.0,1359.0, they just keep adding six and eight.
1359.0,1360.0," Yeah, obviously."
1360.0,1362.0, Because it's what a higher.
1362.0,1365.0," But no, that's actually been one thing."
1365.0,1369.0," I mean, I, it's kind of cool, but it's also going to be a little more confusing in the long run."
1369.0,1372.0," So someone's going to buy a game and if it's in God forbid,"
1372.0,1375.0, it doesn't sell out on the first within the first six months.
1375.0,1378.0," That box is going to say, oh, you need a level five system."
1378.0,1379.0, Right.
1379.0,1385.0," I've seen, I've seen the a couple builds of VISTA and just just the aesthetic of it."
1385.0,1388.0," I mean, just the completely shallow looks factor."
1388.0,1389.0, It is cool.
1389.0,1391.0," I mean, it does look nice."
1391.0,1396.0," And it made me think that's going to be nice, but just in terms of actual practical reality,"
1396.0,1398.0, and do I need this right away?
1398.0,1401.0," Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it's imperative you go out and race out and"
1401.0,1404.0," buy it, but I mean, the fact is other games are going to be."
1404.0,1407.0, Probably as soon as crisis comes out and some of the DX 10.
1407.0,1410.0," I think once you see the applications that really take advantage of it,"
1410.0,1414.0," yeah, I mean, when I see, when I see like, you know, live anywhere,"
1414.0,1417.0," start being popular on the inside of the OS, that's going to be really cool."
1417.0,1420.0," I'm already like, I'm already tinkering out with with gadgets, kind of like,"
1420.0,1423.0, little clocks that you could put on the internet on the desktop.
1423.0,1425.0, Widgets like widgets exactly.
1425.0,1427.0," So I mean, they had the sorry on that."
1427.0,1428.0, I'm back.
1428.0,1429.0, Okay.
1429.0,1433.0," But basically, like, yeah, like widgets, and then they already have ones for like,"
1433.0,1435.0, people have created their own like Xbox live ones.
1435.0,1438.0," So you can have your gamer tag on the front page and you kind of,"
1438.0,1440.0, you kind of see the next step.
1440.0,1441.0, Yep.
1441.0,1449.0, Is that is the default window look still that bubbly crap bubbly crap as in the crap.
1449.0,1452.0," Can you like the default, you know, the default."
1452.0,1456.0," I've had a look at how like the start thing you look and all the window,"
1456.0,1460.0," the title bars, it is still all bubbly and rounded and."
1460.0,1461.0, What do you think?
1461.0,1464.0," Yeah, can you just put like pictures of ponies up anyway?"
1464.0,1468.0," Who's your, don't you have like a, don't you have like a rainbow picture in this."
1468.0,1474.0," I'm just wondering, I hate that."
1474.0,1476.0," Okay, you'll be, you'll be hating it then."
1476.0,1477.0, Yeah.
1477.0,1478.0, Ryan hates that's that's it.
1478.0,1480.0, There's news for you.
1480.0,1481.0, Ryan hates something.
1481.0,1485.0," Hey, Mr. Moli before we run out of time."
1485.0,1488.0," Uh, do you have something to contribute to?"
1488.0,1491.0," Uh, going back to the burning crusade beta."
1491.0,1492.0, You are.
1492.0,1493.0, Yeah.
1493.0,1494.0, Okay.
1494.0,1495.0, Where'd you go?
1495.0,1496.0, I took a couple of weeks off.
1496.0,1497.0, I was distracted by council.
1497.0,1498.0, He was in council.
1498.0,1501.0," Before the week came out, we've been pinned you out on the after that Zelda."
1501.0,1502.0, So just a couple of minutes.
1502.0,1503.0, I don't know how to talk too much about that.
1503.0,1504.0," I mean, he will too."
1504.0,1505.0," If you're, I thought you forgot."
1505.0,1507.0, You guys been playing me with me with me with you at all.
1507.0,1510.0," I have a while ago, but I haven't been in less couple of weeks."
1510.0,1511.0, You've been into it.
1511.0,1512.0, Love it.
1512.0,1513.0, Yeah.
1513.0,1514.0, And this is right now.
1514.0,1517.0, We're in a really nice period for a PC strategy games.
1517.0,1519.0, We got medieval.
1519.0,1522.0," We've got, uh, well, a lot of us are still playing company."
1522.0,1523.0, There's a Jeff Conne.
1523.0,1524.0, Jeff Conne.
1524.0,1525.0, Yes.
1525.0,1526.0, And it's all different kinds of strategy.
1526.0,1527.0, It is.
1527.0,1531.0," I think we're going to have a tough call at the end of the year for, uh, strategy game at the year."
1531.0,1532.0, Maybe we should break it out.
1532.0,1533.0, We might.
1533.0,1534.0, We might go in the past year.
1534.0,1535.0, It's when there's been a lot.
1535.0,1538.0, We've broken it out into real time and turn based.
1538.0,1539.0, We need to.
1539.0,1540.0, And we remember this conversation.
1540.0,1542.0," We were like, few shooters this year."
1542.0,1544.0, We weren't a lot of really good shooters.
1544.0,1545.0, They're here.
1545.0,1546.0, Yeah.
1546.0,1547.0, We're not allowed to multi.
1547.0,1548.0, There weren't any good multi players shooters.
1548.0,1549.0, Yeah.
1549.0,1550.0, I see.
1550.0,1551.0, Let me.
1551.0,1553.0," Shout out there to you all, uh, listen or types."
1553.0,1554.0," But, uh, yo."
1554.0,1556.0, You'll be good.
1556.0,1561.0, We're starting to head into the end of the year.
1561.0,1566.0," We're going to be doing our game of the year stuff in, uh, the march issue, which comes out in February."
1566.0,1571.0," So, uh, if you've got, uh, your thoughts on game of the year stuff, post them on the boards."
1571.0,1572.0," Well, actually, we'll start it."
1572.0,1573.0, We'll start a threat.
1573.0,1574.0, We'll start a threat and you can chime in.
1574.0,1575.0, Yeah.
1575.0,1576.0, Don't start your own threat.
1576.0,1577.0, That's for big.
1577.0,1578.0, We'll delete it.
1578.0,1579.0, That's just chaos.
1579.0,1580.0, I'm getting the wrap-up sign.
1580.0,1581.0," Are we, are we already?"
1581.0,1582.0, Yeah.
1582.0,1583.0, We're ready for the time.
1583.0,1584.0, Okay.
1584.0,1585.0, Okay.
1585.0,1589.0, So we are going to take a break and come back with Ray and Greg from By Were.
1589.0,1594.0," Oh, hello."
1594.0,1595.0, I didn't see there.
1595.0,1598.0," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live."
1598.0,1600.0, The weekly podcast from the editors of Electron and Giving Monthly.
1600.0,1607.0," Along with the wonderful sounds of EGM live comes action packed with special guests,"
1607.0,1612.0," late breaking news, fanboy baiting commentary behind scenes tales of Office Tom Follery, and"
1612.0,1615.0, trivia contest with fan tabulous prizes.
1615.0,1619.0, Download it now at EGMlive.1up.com or subscribe to it through iTunes.
1619.0,1624.0," EGMlive is part of the one-up radio network, tip and the zip-tavis offices and San Francisco."
1624.0,1627.0, It is not actually live and conscious prizes are not guaranteed to be fan tabulous.
1631.0,1640.0, And we are back and joining us via the magic of Skype is three very important persons from By Were incorporated.
1640.0,1646.0," They have called into us from Edmonton, Canada, and we're very happy to have them here."
1646.0,1654.0," We have with us Greg Zestrick, the president of By Were, Ray Muzica, the CEO of By Were,"
1655.0,1666.0," and Scott Gregg, the project director of Dragon Age, their next PC game, which was also the cover story for our first issue of Game Surrendez."
1666.0,1668.0, So hello gentlemen.
1668.0,1670.0," Welcome there, thanks, Steve."
1670.0,1673.0, I have one important question for you first.
1673.0,1675.0, There's a for Ray and Gregg.
1675.0,1678.0, What's the difference between a president and a CEO?
1678.0,1681.0, Why is one one and one the other?
1681.0,1683.0, It's a very interesting question.
1683.0,1685.0, Does the CEO make more than the president?
1685.0,1687.0, I don't know.
1687.0,1689.0," Fortunately, no."
1689.0,1694.0, We're both peers actually at the core of the PC level at our power company by our pandemic.
1694.0,1699.0, But we focus on a lot of the same things here and a lot of different things to the same time.
1699.0,1707.0," So my role is kind of more across all the different areas like projects and operations and sort of development,"
1707.0,1709.0, but it's more of a strategic level.
1709.0,1715.0," And then to make Gregg as the president, I typically go a little more deep on primarily projects,"
1715.0,1719.0," but again, sort of sharing a lot of the project vision strategy stuff with Ray."
1719.0,1721.0, But you're going to help me out.
1721.0,1723.0," Help me out, guys, like Scott on the day-to-day basis."
1723.0,1724.0, This is a little more of a nice.
1724.0,1730.0," So you guys have been together doing this for forever, but did you ever, so did you ever, like, fight?"
1730.0,1731.0," No, I wanted to be CEO."
1731.0,1733.0," No, I wanted to be president."
1733.0,1735.0," Actually, we were joined CEOs."
1735.0,1737.0, We changed it 12 years ago.
1737.0,1741.0, We always wanted to re-configure a shake thing that's a bit mixed up.
1741.0,1746.0," So, as one of you, is like the president, the boss of the CEO, or is it the other way?"
1746.0,1747.0, I'm sorry.
1747.0,1748.0, I'm sorry.
1748.0,1750.0, I'm wrecking this all.
1750.0,1751.0, I'm just a boss of the CEO.
1751.0,1752.0, I'm telling you that right now.
1752.0,1753.0, You're a different one.
1753.0,1754.0, It's an extra boss.
1754.0,1756.0, We actually had another one thing too.
1756.0,1757.0, We have a boss.
1757.0,1759.0," Yeah, they're a whale whale machine."
1759.0,1760.0, We do a boss.
1760.0,1762.0, They have no other boss makes up for my boss.
1762.0,1765.0," Well, you don't see you does stand for chief executive officer."
1765.0,1767.0, I'm just a master of them.
1767.0,1768.0, You're not working here.
1768.0,1769.0, It's really here.
1769.0,1771.0, It's the corporate level and a bio.
1771.0,1774.0," We've been partners and cool founders here for many, many years."
1774.0,1779.0, And we're actually really lucky to have a good partnership where we can work together as peers
1779.0,1781.0, and kind of join and make decisions together.
1781.0,1783.0," Yeah, you were trying to pick a fight between you two."
1783.0,1785.0," Yeah, you weren't taking the bait."
1785.0,1787.0," Well, I want to try and tweet."
1787.0,1791.0," You mean, you know, the new game coming that focuses on a lot of fancy games."
1791.0,1794.0, We did have to remove all the swords from our offices at various times of the year.
1794.0,1798.0, There's been a lot of carpet cleaning.
1798.0,1800.0, I don't want to go on anymore detail on that.
1800.0,1802.0, You.
1802.0,1804.0, So why don't we talk about dragon age?
1804.0,1805.0, That's why we're all here.
1805.0,1809.0, Dragon age is why we're next fantasy role planning is.
1809.0,1812.0, It could be a little different for what we've done the past.
1812.0,1817.0," We're really been pushing for trying to make it more of a dark,"
1817.0,1820.0, her role of fantasy setting.
1820.0,1823.0, So this is a new fantasy role that we've created.
1823.0,1828.0, And we've taken all the elements from what we call high fantasy.
1828.0,1834.0," So you got, you know, wizards, you know, dragons obviously, you know,"
1834.0,1837.0," Quest, see the two aspects from like the high fantasy."
1837.0,1840.0, And we're putting an element from dark fantasy too.
1840.0,1846.0," So let's give you a much more sophisticated, more mature approach to it."
1846.0,1848.0, I think one of the.
1848.0,1851.0," If you want to compare to what we've done in the past,"
1851.0,1856.0, it's actually a bit more targeted towards more grown-up audience.
1856.0,1861.0, So what are the key things we're putting together is we're trying to grow out that.
1861.0,1864.0, That is tactical party based experience.
1864.0,1869.0, We have some or previous game like Baldur's Gate and the Gerwinter's night.
1869.0,1875.0, And pull them into like a next generation experience that you actually play on the PC.
1875.0,1880.0," So when you're saying darker, I've been coupled more than one person while we're visiting"
1880.0,1883.0, brought up like George and our Martin books.
1883.0,1887.0, Is that that kind of influences you're talking about?
1887.0,1890.0," Well, there's been a lot of influences from the team."
1890.0,1893.0, We've actually been working on this for quite some time.
1893.0,1899.0," Even when we were working on our D&D games, there was a lot of ideas that you had that you just couldn't,"
1899.0,1901.0," you know, do in someone else's IP."
1901.0,1902.0, Right.
1902.0,1904.0, And pulling a whole bunch of these things.
1904.0,1908.0," We've been looking where we think the, you know, fantasy audience wants to go."
1908.0,1916.0," And we're, you know, about we're building our own IP or our own fantasy world, we're able to actually do all the cool things we wanted to do for years and years."
1916.0,1918.0," And that's, in a way, a lot of things it's going to do."
1918.0,1923.0," Typically, you know, by our game, I think we like to hope that we think it's probably true."
1923.0,1925.0, It's enjoyed by quite a sophisticated audience.
1925.0,1933.0, And so we have to sort of let the sort of gravity of the decisions of the storylines or something we really want to push.
1933.0,1937.0," And it came that like, you know, like, like, like, dragon-inch."
1937.0,1943.0," I mean, it's really, you know, people that are, you know, kind of handled the heavy decisions you have to make and enjoy that kind of thing."
1943.0,1944.0, It's really what we're driving at.
1944.0,1949.0," We're trying to create a story experience that, you know, like, I guess when you make, you know,"
1949.0,1952.0," you know, it mentioned George R. R. Martin, you know, there's, there's shocking things that happen."
1952.0,1956.0," And we're going to do this similar thing in, in the game."
1956.0,1962.0," Our fans are smart, they're discriminating and, you know, they're kind of fans that really respond well to how meaningful choices in the game."
1962.0,1971.0, Which it hopefully convey a lot of emotion. And the stories I've impact that's really really striving for dragon-inch. It's sort of the pinnacle of everything we've done today.
1971.0,1976.0, We're taking a lot of the folks that have worked past games that fire or a baller's gate never in ice.
1976.0,1984.0," I feel the public can jade empire and all the good stuff we've done over the years and we're just taking all that knowledge and trying to build something that's going to be pretty, pretty compelling."
1984.0,1987.0," Really emotionally fulfilling it at a deep, deep level."
1987.0,1997.0," In all those games that you've worked on that you mentioned, they're definitely warm moments that you can point to it in every game where you had to make some pretty tough moral decisions."
1997.0,2001.0, And the consequences would often be fairly brutal.
2001.0,2009.0," And so you have been able to do that even within the context of somebody else's IP, like a D&D or Star Wars."
2010.0,2023.0, So what do you think you're able to do in an original IP that might be like a Zer specific example you could give listeners as to what kind of extra freedom you might have now?
2023.0,2030.0," Well, we've had the honor of actually working with some of the greatest licenses in my piece in the world."
2030.0,2039.0," And it's been great working with that. But in the end, you have to respect the license holders on it because they're the ones that have set up in the world."
2039.0,2042.0, So there's certain things that you just can't do.
2042.0,2049.0," Now, I don't want to give away any of the real story points on it because, you know, that's kind of the bread and butter on the things."
2049.0,2056.0, But one of the things we'll be striving for is trying to make sure that whatever consequence of the path that they make logical sense.
2056.0,2065.0, So the player is aware of what their choices are going to be. These one may be the decision of self be very emotional and very difficult for them to do.
2065.0,2076.0," Another another way to play the two is, you know, this in times when we want to, they can evolve characters or locations and they kill people off destroy things."
2076.0,2081.0," I mean, and we had, it's effectively we had to answer someone to someone to do that. Now it's really our side."
2081.0,2089.0," But you know, bring up a key character, build it over time, and then knock it down at a later date and some gruesome facts."
2089.0,2098.0," Fashion, it's our choice. I think that that freedom, I mean, we find that freedom to be really, really freeing."
2098.0,2103.0," You know, it's always the openness that we can create. It's kind of one more notch."
2103.0,2107.0," We've had the dial up and we're dialed one more notch upwards, which is really cool."
2107.0,2122.0," With with D&D, for example, like you couldn't necessarily, I mean, you couldn't like fundamentally change something in the forgotten realms world, right? I mean, you'd have to get there approval to destroy an entire Sadie say."
2122.0,2126.0," Yeah, even just for the sake of your own particular fiction, right?"
2126.0,2131.0, Star Wars is not like George Lucas doesn't really probably didn't want certain planets for it.
2131.0,2134.0," Right, right. I'm going to blow up the bookie home, world and co-tor."
2135.0,2136.0, I don't know what to say.
2136.0,2138.0," You're back to what we were pleased with that, obviously."
2138.0,2144.0, Right. But would that be a problem? And I'm not asking these things as a way to dis those IPs at all. I'm just curious.
2144.0,2147.0," If you had, it was honor like Spatzett to work on that."
2147.0,2150.0," So we were, it was honor and there's a great experience."
2150.0,2156.0," So we had great, great respect for, uh, Atari and it looks our true signal for respect to Lee for D&D and the, uh,"
2156.0,2158.0," Oh, we're sure we have great reverence rules."
2158.0,2159.0, Right.
2160.0,2165.0," I'd like say it in the first night to the older public, you had actually wanted to have a player choice,"
2165.0,2168.0, eventually lead to the wookie planet blowing up.
2168.0,2173.0," Like, I mean, would you have, would, is that the kind of thing that like,"
2173.0,2179.0," that Lucas may conceivably have said, even just within the fiction of your game, you're not allowed to do that?"
2180.0,2184.0," Well, that's tough question. I mean, obviously, every situation is different."
2185.0,2187.0, It's nice to be able with the game like Dragon Age.
2187.0,2190.0," You know, now the decision is basically tough to us, right?"
2190.0,2196.0, Besides what's the impact and it doesn't world to the fiction going to be and how is it going to impact the player?
2196.0,2197.0, Right.
2197.0,2201.0," One of the things that Chattas, I'll be wanting is consistency between the things when you're doing nice,"
2201.0,2204.0," the only public, we want to make sure that the fans, you know,"
2204.0,2209.0," who are exposed to the, the modern era stuff, they can see the links on it and it wasn't any consistency."
2209.0,2213.0," This is one of the design philosophy we can take for Dragon Age is that,"
2214.0,2218.0," things in the world may set, you know, just to walk around the corner and there's, you know,"
2218.0,2224.0," some monsters, you know, why are they there? Everything is a dragon age rule to the purpose for being there in these logical sense."
2224.0,2229.0, And all these things all pull together to really make more of versus experience with that.
2229.0,2230.0, Right.
2230.0,2232.0, What do you guys going to do?
2232.0,2238.0," It seems like the freedom is a cool thing about the IP, but on the, on the, on the other hand,"
2238.0,2246.0," the child is going to be getting people to be compelled to want to invest in, in that game,"
2246.0,2253.0, in your fantasy world and what kind of steps are you guys taking to ensure that that's going to happen?
2253.0,2262.0," Like how, how much are you building the world out in your own head? Are you going to release stuff ahead of the game to get people interested in the world?"
2263.0,2271.0," Well, one of the things is that the team has been working for literally years on the backstory of the history of this world,"
2271.0,2272.0, incredibly rich.
2272.0,2274.0, So this feels really well integrated.
2274.0,2278.0," And there's something we're really proud of, the designers have built something that, it feels like it's a living,"
2278.0,2280.0, breathing world.
2280.0,2285.0," So there's small, small, and tall, throughout the game that reflect that and make it feel richer."
2285.0,2289.0," And, you know, we're talking about sharing some of those elements with our dedicated plans,"
2289.0,2294.0," and we're talking about the things that really appeal to the fans when they understand the depth and richness of the fantasy universe,"
2294.0,2300.0," that bring it to life and make it feel like the characters there are real characters, the characters you can come to care about,"
2300.0,2303.0, and that make the story that much more compelling as a result.
2303.0,2308.0," Yeah, I think another factor too is that, you know, the thing is, the thing that you're saying, we can use a making awesome game,"
2308.0,2312.0," like at the end of the day, if we can make it great game, that just is totally compelling with characters you love,"
2312.0,2315.0," I mean people, that's when people get invested."
2315.0,2320.0," And the other thing for the thing is, you know, allowing us to sort of even explore it from, you know,"
2320.0,2323.0," to last few games, that by-ores we're working on."
2323.0,2328.0," You know, I think the game that's derived just true, we think game fiction, it's dedicated to the gaming platform,"
2328.0,2331.0," there's, it's not derived from other stories."
2331.0,2335.0," Actually, you know, it kind of gives you the ability to kind of think about it in a different way."
2335.0,2339.0," Like, you know, we look at things like downloadable content, you know, obviously we sold never went away to modules."
2339.0,2344.0," Like we can think of how to deliver that big story to one chunk and you know, have little stories after the fact,"
2344.0,2349.0," and how it all ties together to giant arc, like we've got so much flexibility in how we put it together,"
2349.0,2353.0," because of the medium, it's felt as it's really interesting."
2353.0,2357.0," So, so does that mean you're, you're pursuing that idea right now with your aggregation,"
2357.0,2361.0," where I like leave the whole world wide open, you go through the story, and then we'll be like additional, like,"
2361.0,2365.0, up a little content after the fact.
2365.0,2368.0," Yeah, so that's actually really important part of our community plan,"
2368.0,2373.0," and that we really believe in supporting our fans, both release and we want to do things that will actually,"
2373.0,2376.0," a lot of the continues, exploring new directions."
2376.0,2379.0," So, obviously, we're building a core game, but we are thinking about the franchise."
2379.0,2386.0," We are thinking about this as a long-term high-peave, that we're going to support the fire for years and years to come."
2386.0,2391.0," You know, the designers have actually built a full-rilled with, you know, history going back 5,000 years,"
2391.0,2394.0, all sorts of different nations and races all interacting together.
2394.0,2400.0," The actual team of drag and age only takes part in one country and the real,"
2400.0,2404.0," in my, you know, there's a lot of area for you to explore, a lot of locations, a lot of variety,"
2404.0,2409.0," but it's still only like a piece of the entire drag and age, really, itself."
2409.0,2416.0," And you know, our design team is looking forward to sort of exploring and, you know, filling out that over time."
2416.0,2418.0," I mean, that's our long-true soul."
2418.0,2422.0," And I think, you know, also the company, we kind of have a very long-term view when it makes stuff like,"
2422.0,2427.0," but we want to, you know, like, you know, like, you know, you can look at like the entire folders,"
2427.0,2432.0," the various gates, arcs, is in one level, or probably one of our, our crowning achievements in the sense of,"
2432.0,2438.0," you know, we took a pretty massive story, like, from beginning to end, and it was a really compelling experience."
2438.0,2443.0," And, you know, at the end of the, the conclusion that you felt, you felt like, wow, I did something."
2443.0,2449.0," And I think what's exciting is that now, again, when we, when we're the ones that kind of control the, the property of the world,"
2449.0,2450.0, we can do that.
2450.0,2451.0, And we've also been doing over and over again.
2451.0,2456.0, We can create all kinds of different stories and all kinds of ways that will put them all together into a giant arc.
2456.0,2459.0," Yeah, there's all kinds of neat things that we can do."
2459.0,2461.0, Mm-hmm.
2461.0,2464.0, Go ahead.
2464.0,2465.0, Okay.
2465.0,2469.0," I just, I was just, just to expand a little on the modules."
2469.0,2473.0," And, obviously, like, you kind of plan here that area with, never winter nights."
2473.0,2478.0," And one thing I really, I did appreciate when I was up there seeing what you guys were up to is how,"
2478.0,2482.0," how detailed and far along the engine is that the fact is like you spend all this time in the back,"
2482.0,2484.0," back in, working on the engine."
2484.0,2489.0," And then, just basically we started to, for, for together, the entire game world inside of like a few months now."
2489.0,2492.0," Why, yes?"
2492.0,2499.0," I'm kind of wondering, I mean, is that full engine going to, that full tool set going to be available day one or?"
2499.0,2504.0," Well, we haven't actually walked down into the exact plans on it."
2504.0,2508.0, We want to have the goal of having a tool known for the community.
2508.0,2512.0," Because there, it always surprises what they're able to actually fill the stuff."
2512.0,2515.0, It's pretty great content that's actually made by the community.
2515.0,2520.0," We just want to make sure that our tools that we're building, our powerful and the,"
2520.0,2522.0, it's made with the community to make a great stuff as well.
2522.0,2525.0, We learned a lot of great lessons on that front with everyone in our night.
2525.0,2531.0, So you go to see everyone in our night's specific test med for us to really deploy all the knowledge we have on community.
2531.0,2538.0," And user-generated content, post release content, things like that, and ongoing story that's part of a long-term plan."
2538.0,2543.0," Those are all things we've learned during bolder state, during every night in the fantasy setting."
2543.0,2546.0, And we're going to take all those lessons and deploy them in a drag action.
2546.0,2550.0, Are you going into this thing with the same kind of mentality as never in our nights?
2550.0,2562.0," Or, you know, because that game seemed to be very much just a way to empower gamers to make their own modules."
2562.0,2565.0, Their own modules and here's by a where sample module.
2565.0,2571.0, But it seems like in this case you're striving more to create your own original experience.
2571.0,2573.0, But very much.
2573.0,2579.0," Yeah, like we're really striving to build first and foremost an amazing story, an amazing experience for the players."
2579.0,2586.0," And at the same time, we recognize this real value in community and having the fans having access to really powerful tools."
2586.0,2591.0," But the first, first and foremost goals to make the game that people are going to talk about and say,"
2591.0,2595.0," that's fantastic, that's fantastic, you're able to play."
2595.0,2602.0," So what when you, you guys first showed this like two or three years ago now at E3 and I was something completely different."
2602.0,2607.0, What exactly did you show off that first time?
2607.0,2612.0," Well, that was essentially our proof of concept."
2612.0,2614.0," Damn, well, that we put together."
2614.0,2620.0," I mean, normally we don't show those publicly, but we want to, you know, reassure the fans that by our risk,"
2620.0,2623.0, commit to actually delivering great experiences on the PC.
2623.0,2627.0, And we thought it was very important to actually have that.
2627.0,2631.0," I would say let them know that yeah, we've got something coming down the pipes."
2631.0,2632.0, It's going to be pretty exciting.
2632.0,2634.0, And we took a look at that.
2634.0,2641.0," We took a look at the technology was going and we decided that, you know, to really deliver the experience we want the, you know,"
2641.0,2648.0," great, like having a great event, you know, just, which the word looking for your way."
2648.0,2653.0," Event, that's a product, you know, basically it's like, wow, that was amazing."
2653.0,2655.0," Okay, yes."
2655.0,2661.0," It's a, you know, trying to make something, it's going to be a landmark, hopefully, when I was out that people will point to and say,"
2661.0,2666.0," if there's moments within that, if never it does before, there's moments that are really reminiscent of the things,"
2666.0,2673.0," fireworks that are passed, but they're just, you know, the things, the basically it's combination of everything we're working for."
2673.0,2676.0," It's out of the town space, train, but it's like, really, this is a goal."
2676.0,2680.0," We, we owe this to our fans because, you know, they've, they've actually kept us in business."
2680.0,2682.0, And we wanted to deliver a great fantasy experience.
2682.0,2685.0, We haven't done a fantasy game at fireworks for a little while now.
2685.0,2691.0," So we think it's high time, really, something to be like a landmark fantasy title from fireworks."
2691.0,2692.0, Right.
2692.0,2696.0, There's some pretty compelling stuff in that original.
2696.0,2697.0, Yep.
2697.0,2700.0," And I think, you know, it's funny coming in in some sense."
2700.0,2706.0," Like, you actually had some really cinematic conversations for the time, like probably the best that we had done is that, you know,"
2706.0,2709.0," the way we look at development, we always kind of build upon our past experience."
2709.0,2713.0," And that was one step along the way of creating this really great, you know, it's like, you know,"
2713.0,2719.0," why, why will this be game-y so, so, so, powering because, you know, we do all the stuff so much differently,"
2719.0,2721.0, so it's better than we have in the past.
2721.0,2726.0," And that was one of that sort of like, I'd go in, it's, at, finally very early view of where we were going."
2726.0,2730.0," Yeah, and we wanted to make sure that the technology was in place, we could actually deliver that experience."
2730.0,2734.0," And at the same time, we wanted to make sure that there was enough care of given to the,"
2734.0,2737.0," uh, the actual design of the actual rules that they themselves."
2737.0,2744.0," Though we had a, like, a small team of designers that were actually, you know, working out at all the time planning of the rules,"
2744.0,2748.0," planning of the story, making sure that everything was up to the standards of what we wanted to do."
2748.0,2756.0," And it was a part of prototype, you know, like testing the technology and it's pushing the boundaries of what we could do."
2756.0,2761.0," You know, can you take part in a giant battle, really feel like you're, you're making a difference in this world."
2761.0,2767.0," Can you, can you think of the way we're pushing lately are pretty exciting as well, like giant creature combat."
2767.0,2772.0," And being able to do choices that actually impact the way the entire story flow of the entire world,"
2772.0,2778.0," um, perceived these are things that have really been pushed to the, um, to the, um, to the edge really in a lot of games yet."
2778.0,2782.0, And we're really trying to take that to another level.
2782.0,2789.0," Um, you guys, uh, the way that, uh, fans have looked at it."
2789.0,2795.0," And I think even the way that we, we have spun it a little in, in the story was, you know, that you guys are,"
2796.0,2800.0, are back now to the PC with this game in your minds.
2800.0,2808.0," Is it, is it, is that how it feels or do you guys feel more like you never left or, or do you feel that that's a little fair?"
2808.0,2814.0," Uh, we've never left. We, we've always been supporting our fans and PFC. They're, we're always, well, they're a really important community to us."
2814.0,2821.0," And we have a Jita Pirate, you come out, uh, we enhanced the, the version we did on the Xbox with a bunch of new stuff,"
2821.0,2826.0," much new content and customized graphics, you know, added a bunch of new features in as a Jita Pirate."
2826.0,2832.0," I made it, made the combat more satisfying and, uh, you know, you know, you could see how it could be a little more fun to make people"
2832.0,2836.0," or all to, to play that game as a result. And, uh, it's, uh, it's got to be a great experience."
2836.0,2841.0," So we, we've been supporting the fans throughout, you know, we have another game coming up shortly as well."
2841.0,2847.0," And so, I think, I think we, we will always want to support the PC fans because they're so important for our like community."
2847.0,2852.0," They, they're, you know, the people that are talking about the games on the forums that kind of build yearly awareness."
2852.0,2857.0," And they're the adopters basically that kind of, you know, propagate the latest mobile games on their excretion with something."
2857.0,2865.0," And I think, keeping the rest of the, I mean, even though we play constantly, guys, they're still pretty hardcore PC players, like we've got, you know, we still play a lot of stuff on the PC."
2865.0,2875.0," So it's, it's still in our blood, and I'll think it'll ever not be because it's not much piece of that experience when you're trying to get certain types of games and gaming experiences like the PC."
2875.0,2879.0," I think the PC is, is unbeatable, like it always will be for certain things."
2879.0,2885.0," It comes on console PC, I often buy both versions just to try out, you know, see what they're like on both systems."
2885.0,2886.0, Sure.
2886.0,2889.0," I kind of gravitate toward the PC quite often, frankly."
2889.0,2893.0," I play on both, but I love PC games."
2893.0,2898.0," And there are those games that, like what they call them, wow, I think, because it's called some sort of..."
2899.0,2911.0," Well, I think, you know, on this magazine here, we've talked about it, and they'll say on the podcast and many of our listeners would argue too much that, that, you know, we're all pretty platform agnostic here."
2911.0,2917.0," You know, and we all have multiple machines and play different kind of games for different reasons."
2917.0,2919.0," Yeah, yeah, totally great."
2919.0,2926.0," I mean, because there's so many great lessons to learn from, handheld, PC, and online games, and the console games."
2926.0,2928.0, You just can't do it here.
2928.0,2935.0," If you want to be in a developer that's progressive and innovating, you have to look for the best of breed on all systems and try and bring those things together."
2935.0,2940.0," So really, you know, we don't really see the platform, there's really distinct, you know, for us."
2940.0,2947.0, We're trying to take features that are the best game features to make the best experience and apply them wherever we can on both platforms.
2947.0,2957.0," So why would a game like Mass Effect be right for Xbox 360, whereas like Dragon Age is on PC? Why the distinction? Why not put them on both?"
2957.0,2963.0," This is a variety of factors, like I think, you know, it ends up being..."
2963.0,2967.0," There's business factors, there's sort of aesthetic factors."
2967.0,2972.0," It's almost like there's, you know, each one goes into pretty complex sort of an health and culturally."
2972.0,2976.0, And we have to kind of juggle a lot of things to sort of make the decision.
2976.0,2982.0," And it's quite the same. I mean, I think what we want to do is it's always been, like, you know, it's kind of the reason I get to know what we say."
2982.0,2990.0," We start with handheld sections, the company is like, we want to have something that's really impactful on, at almost every platform."
2990.0,2998.0," I guess it's maybe the only thing is like, we want to create handheld games to sort of say, hey, we're over here at Xbox 360, it's a hey, we're over there."
2998.0,3001.0," You know, if we want to, we want to have a broader each."
3001.0,3009.0," It's interesting because, you know, some companies have definitely sort of made the, you know, you see them dabble a little bit in the consoles."
3009.0,3015.0," And then if they get lucky and have a hit, they kind of never go back in a way."
3015.0,3021.0," And it seems like it's possible that in a way you could have done that with this, right?"
3021.0,3030.0," I mean, you had pretty good success with Jdampire and Mass Effect is obviously getting lots of love so far."
3030.0,3046.0," I mean, I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking, it's just that I'm not asking for you just to say like, because we love the PC, but like in a way you could have just said, well, we've done that and this market isn't as big and it you've chosen not to do that."
3046.0,3047.0, Is that again?
3047.0,3048.0," Yeah, I'm just going to be talking about the game."
3048.0,3055.0," And honestly, we have people that look by our games in all different platforms in the way that we want to try and deliver the best story, different games."
3055.0,3056.0, And that's our goal.
3056.0,3061.0," But by our, is to try and really re-estriving to deliver the best story, different games in the world."
3061.0,3064.0," And there's lots of fans out there, lots of different platforms."
3064.0,3066.0, And all the games are going to be a little different.
3066.0,3068.0, And we're going to be customized.
3068.0,3072.0," They're going to be really, you know, developed with care and attention."
3072.0,3080.0," And it really, you know, really customized rates platform, but we want to support the fans and all the different systems."
3080.0,3096.0," When I ask you a question to say about your general like success and state of where you guys are at right now, when you first came to CGW many years ago, you were you were pitching shattered steel."
3097.0,3107.0," And then, and then even even in the botherscape days, actually, I don't know if you remember this, but there was one time when botherscape wanted come out and you guys were working on botherscape too."
3107.0,3109.0, And we're hitting us up for covers.
3109.0,3112.0," And at that time, we were still sort of blocking."
3112.0,3118.0," And I remember you being totally frustrated, you were like, what the hell do we have to do to make it on the cover of CGW?"
3118.0,3119.0, Aren't we?
3119.0,3125.0," And now, you know, we would basically put whatever you did on the cover with that even knowing what you did."
3125.0,3127.0, It's like a picture of race mode going to so go.
3127.0,3128.0, Right.
3128.0,3129.0, People put them on the cover.
3129.0,3133.0, I remember the center.
3133.0,3134.0, I think it's me.
3134.0,3136.0, I think it's me and Elliot.
3136.0,3137.0, Yeah.
3137.0,3140.0, I was really impressed because he had this big monitor.
3140.0,3142.0," Like, this was back in the day when we were, yeah, it was like really big."
3142.0,3144.0," I was like, came back and just tried modern."
3144.0,3148.0," I was like, I was like, what are you going to do?"
3148.0,3153.0," But I would assume that our attitude is probably like, you know, similar to like a lot of people's in it."
3153.0,3165.0," It just makes me wonder like you have now gone from being like total underdogs and unknown people who weren't even in the gaming business to now being really, you know, kind of on top in a way."
3165.0,3171.0, And and I wonder how the the pressure is different to you like how it feels.
3171.0,3174.0, Is it harder now? Is it easier now?
3174.0,3176.0, It's being humble.
3176.0,3178.0, And your only as good as your next game.
3178.0,3182.0, And then the idea of your fans and that's what we look at it is we can't let our fans down.
3182.0,3185.0, Not once.
3185.0,3196.0, One thing to think is there's been an attitude that really hasn't changed from beginning and all the people here do in the end they just want to make a really really good game that they enjoy playing.
3196.0,3200.0," And our fans, in our fact, they've got a good value for money."
3200.0,3201.0, Yeah.
3201.0,3206.0," And this hasn't changed from the beginning and we're our harshest critics, you know, whatever anyone else has both stuff."
3206.0,3210.0," You know, we're ten times as hard as anybody else on this episode we do."
3210.0,3214.0, We're always looking for improvements always way to living a better game experience.
3214.0,3218.0," Yeah, this one is one time we had we had a, we're having this."
3218.0,3220.0, It's almost a casualty free.
3220.0,3227.0," We're, if I walked in a room and I don't know if I think all of us, I think three of us in another, trying to come with a guy that's sitting around."
3227.0,3231.0," Just going to town or one of our games and going, ah, you know, and there's this, there's that."
3231.0,3236.0," And if I walk in the instrument, other game companies, you can just ask for like, stunned for like 10 minutes."
3236.0,3239.0," And he says, well, he can't just win the game."
3239.0,3244.0," He can just, you guys just, what, like, you sound like you're like, the worst game ever that you guys just made."
3244.0,3247.0," Yeah, it's really, it's pretty good."
3247.0,3248.0, But it could be better.
3248.0,3250.0," Yeah, and I think we are really expecting it."
3250.0,3251.0, It's always easy to do.
3251.0,3254.0," Yeah, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, you know,"
3254.0,3259.0," Yeah, things are really extremely hard, but, you know, we're not perfectionists either."
3259.0,3266.0," It's just that, you know, I think from our perspective, we, and that's actually where, we're maybe that, you know, we don't feel the pressure because we always had it on ourselves anyway."
3266.0,3273.0," Like, like, we don't worry too much about the, you know, I can't say that we don't, like, sort of wait for every single review and you know,"
3273.0,3277.0," to tell me, check all that, you know, the medicritic game ranking stuff for our products."
3277.0,3278.0," Let me, we do."
3278.0,3279.0, We do.
3279.0,3280.0, We do.
3280.0,3281.0, We hang on that stuff at the same time.
3281.0,3282.0, Don't get us started on that.
3282.0,3283.0, We don't please.
3283.0,3285.0, We're not big fans ourselves.
3285.0,3291.0," Yeah, that's the way we, the way we operate it, you know, we did really, it's almost like a peer pressure now."
3291.0,3295.0," Like we also have multiple projects and everyone wants everything to be well because it kind of keeps the,"
3295.0,3298.0, the positive energy flow for the next project on the pipe.
3298.0,3302.0," See, a lot of, you know, your peers at the company, there's over 300 people working here now."
3302.0,3305.0," And there's a lot like, you know, lots of lots of games are working on."
3305.0,3307.0," So, you know, they're all really good people."
3307.0,3309.0, They're a part of their passion that created as hardworking.
3309.0,3313.0," And it's really crazy, making great games and they want everyone to succeed."
3313.0,3318.0," And so, you know, our, our colleagues here at the company are the ones who want to make sure,"
3318.0,3319.0, we don't let down the most.
3319.0,3322.0," I mean, you want to make sure that they're, they have like that nice record when they,"
3322.0,3325.0, they're game and the last one is successful.
3325.0,3327.0, The next one will be as well hopefully.
3327.0,3330.0, Sussexess has not spoiled by where yet.
3330.0,3336.0," You just wait for the, we've worked for monitors that 14 inches now, but not much."
3336.0,3339.0," Actually, we have pretty good monitors."
3339.0,3341.0, We're looking down for doors that close.
3341.0,3343.0," Now, the first office we were in."
3343.0,3345.0, I'm down from doors closed with your foot.
3345.0,3348.0," So, we'll start by the first office."
3349.0,3354.0," The first, the first office I visited up in Edmonton was was shockingly low rent."
3354.0,3356.0, Yeah.
3356.0,3358.0," I went to one of the, let me consider that."
3358.0,3361.0," Well, there was one where like, you know, there's funny footage and there's a bunch like,"
3361.0,3364.0," next this restaurant about this like, you know, secondhand bookstore."
3364.0,3368.0," And I think we, we actually finally looked at the electrical system."
3368.0,3371.0," We, we could believe that the 30 computers had like,"
3371.0,3373.0, completely blown over four breakers.
3373.0,3375.0, There's your finishing.
3375.0,3377.0," Yeah, actually, they started to, we started to crack."
3377.0,3381.0," Yeah, yeah, it started to break down at the end, but there for less than a year."
3381.0,3384.0," I'm a small, I think we're still on a, you know, I think, you know,"
3384.0,3387.0," we still want to do good stuff like we don't want to, we don't want to,"
3387.0,3390.0," we, we've a lot of, you know, folks of the fours what we make."
3390.0,3393.0," You know, we don't want to sort of have to feel that that, you know,"
3393.0,3395.0, we're letting them down or not doing a good thing.
3395.0,3397.0, And each game has to be better than the previous one.
3397.0,3400.0," So it's, you know, you put all the other stuff in the past."
3400.0,3402.0, Because we have such good people here.
3402.0,3404.0," I mean, we, we make, we, our games are pretty good."
3404.0,3406.0," So we try, we try to make each one, but in the last,"
3406.0,3408.0," the goal, they're okay."
3408.0,3410.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3410.0,3415.0," When I, yeah, when I was up there to, to see Baldur's Gate 2 for the first time,"
3415.0,3420.0," at that point in, at the size of the company where you were at,"
3420.0,3423.0," Ray, I'm not sure about Greg, if you were doing this too, but Ray,"
3423.0,3428.0, I remember that you were taking home builds every single night to play the game.
3428.0,3432.0," Your, your involvement was was extremely hands on."
3432.0,3434.0, Is it still that way with Dragon Age?
3434.0,3438.0," Or have you, has a company gotten to play the play?"
3438.0,3440.0, That's the right thing.
3440.0,3444.0," One of the projects we just, you know, usually we get down to the critical phase where the,"
3444.0,3447.0," you know, you're tweaking gameplay, you're tweaking the actual experience."
3447.0,3450.0, That's when the feedback from Ray and Ray's specials important to them.
3450.0,3451.0, Right.
3451.0,3455.0," So, you do there in the beginning, like I think, there's, there's sort of two phases that were quite intense,"
3455.0,3458.0," which is that, when we still do that, we still do play like, you know,"
3458.0,3461.0," we're still, hey, we're getting builds of JCC, frankly, like I think there's,"
3461.0,3465.0," you wouldn't come in a moral, so the latest, the latest and greatest we're going to be, you know,"
3465.0,3470.0," playing it and, you know, filing bugs and like, comment, like, reviewing the status to team."
3470.0,3473.0," You know, that's still, you know, at the end of the day, that's what our passion ultimately is."
3473.0,3477.0, It's actually playing the games and then having to have it helping women.
3477.0,3480.0," So, you know, we, we helped get them started using for like a couple months, kind of like,"
3480.0,3485.0," start the direction, then, you know, that's the, and then, tenths of point to second,"
3485.0,3489.0," and it would be like, through a whole middle, and we, we started sort of checking in and,"
3489.0,3492.0," and, and, and, and, and, and, sort of, more observing and making sure we're on track as"
3492.0,3496.0," the visions maintain, and then, you know, I'm, frankly, I mean, teams are so talented and so focused,"
3496.0,3500.0," and so good at what they do know, that, that ends up being, you know, more of a pleasure than"
3500.0,3503.0," any else, we just sort of see how things unfold, it's really great out,"
3503.0,3506.0," that it gave the people our, and finally, Christmas every day."
3506.0,3507.0," Yeah, it's awesome."
3507.0,3508.0," I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,"
3508.0,3511.0," I mean, we want to walk around, it looks all at cool stuff, I've got this cool thing."
3511.0,3514.0, You're going to get to see all the stuff that's in development that you're not seeing
3514.0,3517.0," every day, kind of like, I think, something tough, because it's very exciting."
3517.0,3521.0," And then, again, we play the games, take them home, and, you know, we really, we love it,"
3521.0,3524.0," you know, because we're, we're big RPG fans, you say, not the core."
3524.0,3525.0, Why are we doing this?
3525.0,3529.0," So, everybody here looks RPGs, they're all, they're all passionate about making the best"
3529.0,3530.0, games in the world.
3530.0,3533.0," That, that was driver for, we, we, we, we, we, we've done the horizon, you know,"
3533.0,3536.0," that perfect game, it's, we're always driving through to, to reach that point."
3536.0,3539.0," And we'll get there, you know, where we're getting there once, definitely."
3539.0,3544.0," Well, it seems he keeps driving there by, like, I was just noticing, so we know that you're"
3544.0,3547.0, going to be using the conversation system from mass effect in Dragon Age.
3547.0,3551.0, Are there other elements from previous games that you think are going to be a good
3551.0,3552.0, fit in Dragon Age?
3552.0,3556.0," Like, are you going to take the combat system from J&P, or modify that, or what sort of"
3556.0,3561.0, things you're thinking that kind of need to happen to get closer to that perfection?
3562.0,3566.0," One of the ways we approach our games is going to be quite a great answer to this, but we kind of"
3566.0,3569.0, break right down our core features into a few categories.
3569.0,3574.0," There's, as long as related story and character, and, you know, things like facial"
3574.0,3579.0," system, the, the animation systems, the way the dialogue unfolds, you know, things like that."
3579.0,3583.0," That's really important to the, being realistic, emotional kind of compelling, emotionally"
3583.0,3587.0, compelling experiences and characters that are credible or believable.
3587.0,3591.0," So, you know, progression systems, customization, you want to have really interesting"
3591.0,3595.0," progression systems, statistics and things like that that are accessible and all"
3595.0,3599.0," in hand, really easy to understand, yet there are a lot of depth and opportunities for"
3599.0,3603.0," you to customize your character and really, really, you're making a meaningful"
3603.0,3607.0," progression through the game, the very satisfying conflict and combat that's going to"
3607.0,3610.0," part of the game, you always have to have a villain, and somebody can really, really"
3610.0,3614.0," relish, you know, someone to really enjoy or bring it down and feeding."
3614.0,3616.0," So, you, if you're going to have that at some point, there's got to be some tension"
3616.0,3619.0," in the world, and of course, you've got to have exploration."
3619.0,3623.0," You have to have really interesting worlds to explore, big open landscapes,"
3623.0,3625.0, it's a very popular type of game plane out.
3625.0,3628.0," So, we're trying to embrace that as well, and each of these has lots of"
3628.0,3632.0," features that are associated with them, and we look to the past,"
3632.0,3634.0, to hold together the features that are worked very well.
3634.0,3638.0," We try to innovate and try to improve that's all the time as well, and"
3638.0,3641.0," link all these things together, activity, and chance to call."
3641.0,3645.0," One of the things we also do with, we take a couple areas on each game,"
3645.0,3648.0," say, these are the areas we're going to put a lot of effort in trying to"
3648.0,3650.0, take it above and beyond anything we've done before.
3650.0,3655.0," In mass effect, they did that with the conversation and some other things on it."
3655.0,3658.0," With Dragon Age, what the areas we're really going to be pushing is the"
3658.0,3659.0, party based combat.
3659.0,3663.0," So, we have lots of things where your characters are interacting with the"
3663.0,3669.0," environment, with the other characters, combination attacks, and we also"
3669.0,3674.0," want to do large creature combat, like you've never been done before."
3674.0,3678.0, We've done large creatures in the past.
3678.0,3684.0," If you've sat down and it's like, well, if there was a 14 foot tall monster"
3684.0,3687.0," that would move them and it was four of us trying to take it down, how do we go"
3687.0,3688.0, about that?
3688.0,3690.0, And that's where we started.
3690.0,3692.0," We really want to capture the feel of the trained, cold,"
3692.0,3696.0," capable fight from the Lord of the Rings, and we'll be right, where"
3696.0,3699.0," the six of us sat and said, yeah, that's what we wanted."
3699.0,3701.0, We weren't delivered out of experience.
3701.0,3705.0," We also choice, like, really pushing the outlook for the way the story unfolds."
3705.0,3707.0, That is sort of middle level.
3707.0,3710.0," If you make choices, you want to see outcomes that are different than other"
3710.0,3711.0, players.
3711.0,3712.0, That's always really fun to hear.
3712.0,3716.0," But if you're in a moment when you did this and this happens, you're like, no,"
3716.0,3717.0, I didn't do that.
3717.0,3719.0," I did this instead, and then this happened."
3719.0,3723.0," And then what if you imagine that kind of going out to the whole story view,"
3723.0,3726.0," you know, like, reactionally, meaning could have outcomes of, you know,"
3726.0,3729.0," a tired, different groups are aligned with you at the end of the game,"
3729.0,3731.0, depending on what you've done.
3731.0,3732.0, Yeah.
3732.0,3733.0, We want to have that.
3733.0,3735.0," That's a normal, really change."
3735.0,3739.0, Because you're the consequences of your action or actions are very apparent.
3739.0,3743.0," Well, actually, we do a dabble around, you know, in the past, I think, yeah."
3743.0,3745.0, There's a bit of pieces in the game.
3745.0,3746.0," Yeah, you did."
3746.0,3749.0," And in Jane, there was actually, you know, the folks with the PCLC,"
3749.0,3752.0, there's a few pretty neat things that you actually have ended that at
3752.0,3754.0," Jacob first, the public opinion."
3754.0,3755.0," Yeah, exactly."
3755.0,3758.0," But also in the middle, there's the kind of landing stuff."
3758.0,3761.0," And the things that are, that just, it's kind of like, we start, okay,"
3761.0,3762.0, let's take a little further.
3762.0,3765.0," And so the ones that happen, then, you know, mass-decked on other steps,"
3765.0,3768.0," I think, you know, I think we really think the right image of, like,"
3768.0,3769.0, two worst steps after that.
3769.0,3772.0," So it's like a neat, it's neat to sort of like,"
3772.0,3774.0," and that's the thing where Scott says, I think because we,"
3774.0,3776.0," you have to say, in folks who have had for a long time,"
3776.0,3780.0," Scott, with the lead programmer on call, on folders gate,"
3780.0,3782.0," and they're one or nine, so he's been with us for a long time,"
3782.0,3785.0," and so I, you know, all those things unfold."
3785.0,3787.0," So, you know, we, we fortunately have a lot of things,"
3787.0,3789.0," and all these games, what happens, they kind of,"
3789.0,3791.0," so you know, yeah, we did this this time,"
3791.0,3795.0," but let's let's do a little further, so that when you've got that kind of organizational memory,"
3795.0,3799.0," you can actually do pretty neat stuff because you're starting at a different level,"
3799.0,3801.0," and so I'm going to say, hey, let's, we've never made this kind of game of forms,"
3801.0,3802.0, try and make one.
3802.0,3806.0," That allowed us to kind of do some pretty cool, pretty cool things."
3806.0,3811.0," Is it a, just from a, a technical standpoint or a gameplay standpoint,"
3811.0,3816.0," is it, is it that hard to do that kind of thing you're talking about,"
3816.0,3819.0," where, where moral decisions will change the world?"
3819.0,3825.0," Because I'm just curious as to why most other folks don't even attempt to do it,"
3825.0,3828.0, because when it happens in games like this.
3828.0,3830.0," It's like, it's like really hard."
3830.0,3833.0," It's probably one of the hardest things that we can do because it,"
3833.0,3837.0, it's like making 100 different games in one box.
3837.0,3839.0," Yeah, that's what it really is."
3839.0,3842.0, And then you have to think of it in a kind of spectacular content.
3842.0,3845.0," It's exponentially more complex, just to build,"
3845.0,3849.0," integrate tasks because you have to create,"
3849.0,3853.0," outcomes for every, what if is that it or that that really is."
3853.0,3856.0," That's the thing, you want, you want the possibilities based for the players."
3856.0,3859.0," You want to build a choose what they want to do, they combat it,"
3859.0,3863.0," attack the global, and then it is strategic little through the main story arc."
3863.0,3867.0," And if you really achieve that, you can achieve something that's,"
3867.0,3869.0," I don't think it's been really ever done in a game before,"
3869.0,3871.0, you have choices at every level possible.
3871.0,3873.0, That's what Greg and Angel's about.
3873.0,3877.0," It's being able to really fulfill the fantasy and be the character you want to be,"
3877.0,3881.0," and have the party members around you and approach combat that we want to approach it,"
3881.0,3883.0, and then approach the story that we want to approach it.
3883.0,3886.0," There'd be the hero, the tyrant, or anywhere in between."
3886.0,3888.0," Well, I mean, to maybe put a number on it."
3888.0,3892.0," I remember it was a J&M fire, we were doing some rough calculations over together,"
3892.0,3896.0," but okay, how many presentations of characters and choices,"
3897.0,3901.0," you know, so there's not all these things you can do amongst the characters and do things with them."
3901.0,3906.0," Okay, let's put down a, there's a rough gap, okay, there's a 130,000 different outcomes."
3906.0,3912.0," I don't mean like, story, like, along the way, for example, different paths, different ways you can do goals."
3912.0,3913.0, That's a little too many to test.
3913.0,3918.0," What the figure out a different way they do is, if you do an attempt to introduce a lot of automation tests,"
3918.0,3922.0," they have a few egg group, because they're really specialized in testing RPGs."
3922.0,3926.0," And our design group, our animators, our programmers, everyone across the board."
3926.0,3930.0," You know, the organizational knowledge is there because our turnover is so low."
3930.0,3935.0," We're able to retain these great, great people across the board that are passionate, smart, creative,"
3935.0,3936.0, and they don't want to make this stuff.
3936.0,3941.0," And they've done it, you know, half a dozen dozen times before a different product's been."
3941.0,3948.0," So, you know, the following comes back to the Wolverine's limit to the player is the natural experience with their actually doing it."
3948.0,3954.0," You know, we see that we want you to live the game, not watch the game, right?"
3954.0,3959.0," I'll be really interested in seeing you guys can pull this off with your MMO,"
3959.0,3968.0," because one of the things that MMOs don't do well, at least now, is making you feel like you're actually having some sort of effect on the world."
3968.0,3973.0, It always feels like you're just kind of this really bit player in something going on.
3973.0,3977.0," Because you can't change it because if you do something, then, you know, the other guy can't do it."
3977.0,3980.0," More important, the story just feels like half way."
3980.0,3986.0," Can't talk too much about that, but the actual information mentioned that, yeah, you know, it's kind of funny for me."
3986.0,3995.0," When we actually try and put our experience with, again, making it, making it MMOs, it's a very, it's neat, because we actually, we kind of want to go different directions."
3995.0,3999.0," And so, and again, that's another super team working on some really cool stuff."
3999.0,4003.0, There's a lot of folks from the sort of Austin scene working.
4003.0,4007.0," There's also a number of, you know, pilot reports from Edmonton that's going down."
4007.0,4010.0, So it's a neat degree to make sure of people all super talented.
4010.0,4017.0," You know, we actually, that's one of the sort of fun things that we do get to do is we get to go and sort of check out what they're doing."
4017.0,4022.0," You know, sort of seeing the various sort of scenes, it's another thing that look at it, other prototype to play."
4022.0,4024.0," You know, it's just so much fun."
4024.0,4026.0, That's always really cool.
4026.0,4032.0," So, I'm kind of wondering, so the members from the Edmonton team that are down there in Austin right now, besides enjoying the study or weather,"
4032.0,4037.0, what did those members work on before going down there?
4037.0,4042.0," What did the folks who came from fire were going to the fire roster, we're kind of wondering where they were here in Hamilton?"
4042.0,4043.0, Yeah.
4043.0,4051.0," Okay, yeah, there's actually folks who worked on pretty much every game we've ever released, I think, down there, across the board, the great."
4051.0,4061.0," Yeah, I don't think there's a single probably not really anything that hasn't represented our, our, our creative director down in Austin, James Allen."
4061.0,4069.0," Was one of our most senior designers and across the board, we got some other great designers down there and full range of people that are like really,"
4069.0,4072.0," a top notch top, top notch industry really."
4072.0,4077.0," Yeah, like the James was a weekly designer and many of them, and the ball was getting totally on ball, they're still,"
4077.0,4080.0, and we don't need to let them go to public.
4080.0,4084.0," So, I think that's a good stuff under spell, they've got some of this, you know, pride's attendance there."
4084.0,4089.0," And unfortunately a lot of the other guys are here and they've been a filled, filled in the shoes,"
4089.0,4096.0," and you know, James saw that ball across the whole company, there's a lot of, it's great because, you know, we have such a wealth of people, especially in the design alley,"
4096.0,4104.0," the other area is that kind of know what to do this stuff, and it's wonderful to be able to kind of go off and tackle the challenges with them and have the guys, you know,"
4104.0,4111.0," all still interacting with the hate, we're learning this on him and we'll bring that back to these games that we're going to hear, it's really cool stuff."
4111.0,4118.0," It's great because we have such a little turnover again, it can all come down to the people because we have people that are passionate about story and character."
4118.0,4132.0," And the mission statement that we're driving towards and they've stayed with us for years, so they worked on an underproducts and they've grown, you know, in the process of being, you know, we have amazing people here and have it said add-offs and we're so lucky."
4132.0,4139.0," Cool. Well, we definitely have like 800 more questions about the MMO, but you probably can't answer any of them, yes, right?"
4139.0,4144.0," No, not yet, but we're so excited. It's a great thing that we really can't answer."
4144.0,4149.0," I'm sorry, I'm so holding my tongue right now, should I ask the question?"
4149.0,4154.0," We'll save that for another interview if you're not, you guys aren't ready."
4154.0,4159.0, I have my glasses.
4159.0,4162.0, How are you doing on time?
4162.0,4164.0, I wish you'd be.
4164.0,4167.0," Okay, we have a couple minutes left."
4167.0,4168.0, It sounds.
4168.0,4173.0," You know, that's the usual way you play a question, so that's what we're going to close with."
4173.0,4177.0," Oh, yeah, they're easy. We're going to keep you on your toes when to ask you out the end."
4177.0,4179.0," Well, we do that. Got your plan."
4179.0,4182.0, What are you playing?
4182.0,4184.0," Oh, right now?"
4184.0,4185.0, Yeah.
4185.0,4187.0, That was playing right now.
4187.0,4188.0, Right now.
4188.0,4189.0," No, not right now. I'm not going to talk."
4189.0,4191.0, Hopefully you're not playing any.
4191.0,4192.0, Playing solid solid.
4192.0,4193.0, Mine sweeper.
4193.0,4195.0, We can't control the time.
4195.0,4197.0," Well, actually right now I'm playing dragon."
4197.0,4199.0, It's a way you guys are supposed to know that.
4200.0,4201.0, Wait a rub it in.
4201.0,4203.0, Thanks guys. We got to be a winner.
4203.0,4204.0, Good to see you.
4204.0,4205.0, Got to get three.
4205.0,4206.0, Got to play.
4206.0,4207.0," Well, a self-adventy."
4207.0,4209.0, The latest Final Fantasy in Karnatio.
4209.0,4213.0, Many of course play a not to play a Final Fantasy 3 on DF.
4213.0,4214.0," Oh, I'm playing that too."
4214.0,4215.0, That's a lot of fun.
4215.0,4216.0, Great.
4216.0,4217.0, We're a lot of fun.
4217.0,4220.0, I guess it's kind of right to spoil those memories.
4220.0,4221.0, We've always had little interest.
4221.0,4223.0, We play the Final Fantasy 3 thing.
4223.0,4227.0," We kind of say, do you know anything about the tower of a win?"
4227.0,4228.0," Oh, my God."
4228.0,4229.0, That's right.
4229.0,4230.0, Where I'm stuck.
4230.0,4231.0, I'll start.
4231.0,4232.0, I'll start with a please.
4232.0,4234.0, It'll be spoilers for everyone.
4234.0,4236.0, I'll go for the audience.
4236.0,4238.0," They keep telling me I got to like, you know,"
4238.0,4240.0, we have to turn into toodes and I don't know how to do it.
4240.0,4243.0, I told him to stop in that tower.
4243.0,4245.0," If you want to do it, please."
4245.0,4246.0, Yeah.
4246.0,4249.0, Please send your gameplay tips to my worst strategy hour.
4249.0,4251.0, You have that yet.
4251.0,4253.0, That's a great.
4253.0,4254.0, It's great.
4254.0,4255.0, I'm loving it.
4256.0,4260.0, Check the whole towns around that the area you'll find is I think someone is so much.
4260.0,4261.0, Thank you.
4261.0,4263.0, Is that a good spot?
4263.0,4264.0," Yeah, that's a good spot."
4264.0,4267.0, I really enjoyed crossing through right now.
4267.0,4270.0, I've just heard one of the games I'm kind of most immersed.
4270.0,4274.0," I just started a few days ago, but you know, both kind of were both big fans of that."
4274.0,4275.0, Pretty cool.
4275.0,4278.0," Where there's some problems with the European version and like,"
4278.0,4281.0, it's most of us been solved for the North American version?
4282.0,4287.0," I don't know. We got, we actually got 10 of your paid version from my friends at the front of the bike."
4287.0,4289.0, So that's the one I'm playing right now.
4289.0,4290.0," You know, we've passed it in the world."
4290.0,4292.0," Yeah, so I got the biggest contract."
4292.0,4295.0, I'm looking forward to it. I like Gothic too.
4295.0,4296.0," Yeah, yeah."
4296.0,4297.0, Gothic too is good.
4297.0,4298.0, I think Gothic 3 is better personally.
4298.0,4299.0, Yeah.
4299.0,4301.0," You know, it's so big."
4301.0,4302.0, It will blow your mind.
4302.0,4303.0, Cool.
4303.0,4306.0," Like, like, I've been playing it for a while."
4306.0,4307.0," Like, like, rain."
4307.0,4310.0," Like, you know, how one of those explorers takes it."
4310.0,4312.0," And it's like, run off at a random direction of the OFI."
4312.0,4314.0, Go to something stalls on me.
4314.0,4317.0," You know, I'm like, please, you know, try to follow the questions."
4317.0,4319.0," Yeah, this is a little bit of a fact that you can, you can,"
4319.0,4323.0," you can, they show the quest of one group and then turn another group against that group."
4323.0,4326.0," And, you know, basically destroy them and then get extra experience for doing that."
4326.0,4327.0," Oh, wow."
4327.0,4330.0," That's a great, great year, you're completed."
4330.0,4331.0, I never knew that.
4331.0,4335.0," It would have put in the gameplay logs of like,"
4335.0,4337.0, number of hours played like in the saved games.
4337.0,4339.0, You just always like twice as big as everyone else.
4339.0,4340.0, That's what that was.
4340.0,4341.0, That was fun.
4341.0,4342.0, That was fun.
4342.0,4343.0, That was going to be fun.
4343.0,4344.0, Yeah.
4344.0,4346.0, That's what I never or two is actually really cool too.
4346.0,4347.0, Yeah.
4347.0,4348.0, It's neat.
4348.0,4350.0, I got them that in the pile.
4350.0,4351.0, It's actually very fun to see.
4351.0,4354.0," For us, one of the thrills is actually working with a group"
4354.0,4357.0, externally when they take our engine tech and they build a new game with it.
4357.0,4358.0, And then we get to play that game.
4358.0,4361.0," Yeah, we haven't only, we haven't only looked at number one or"
4361.0,4362.0, nights too yet.
4362.0,4364.0, I'm just 10.
4364.0,4365.0, Yeah.
4365.0,4367.0, That's a little bit of a joke around here.
4367.0,4368.0, That game.
4368.0,4369.0, Yeah.
4369.0,4370.0, Yeah.
4370.0,4371.0, A little move on.
4371.0,4373.0, I liked it.
4373.0,4375.0, I liked the campaign a lot.
4375.0,4378.0, I might as shoes were all technical based.
4378.0,4379.0, That's all.
4379.0,4382.0, But I have a lot of respect for the Obsidian guys.
4382.0,4385.0, And I thought they did a great job with the story in that campaign.
4385.0,4386.0, Yeah.
4386.0,4387.0, Yeah.
4387.0,4388.0, It's fun to play it.
4388.0,4389.0, We're enjoying it.
4389.0,4390.0, Yeah.
4390.0,4391.0, We're enjoying it.
4391.0,4392.0," It's a great, it's neat."
4392.0,4393.0, It's neat seeing it for the first time.
4393.0,4397.0, I don't know if you're trying to see what's in your head with what where you would have gone with.
4397.0,4398.0, It's neat to see all the others.
4398.0,4399.0, Some of them are just interpretation.
4399.0,4402.0, It's pretty cool actually.
4402.0,4406.0," Well, you guys, I mean, you've had a long-term relationship with those guys, right?"
4406.0,4409.0," I mean, it goes back to the beginning, really."
4409.0,4410.0, Doesn't it?
4410.0,4411.0, To Baldur's Gate 1?
4411.0,4412.0, Yeah.
4412.0,4413.0, Yeah.
4413.0,4414.0, Yeah.
4414.0,4415.0, We published an interplay back to Black Owls studios.
4415.0,4416.0," We're like, polish your background."
4416.0,4419.0, Do I think the Black Owls name is Black Owls name is this fact?
4419.0,4420.0, Then I think.
4420.0,4421.0, Right.
4421.0,4422.0, Black Owls name is this tool.
4422.0,4423.0, Yeah.
4423.0,4425.0," But the PGA version, which was the PGA one I think."
4425.0,4426.0, Okay.
4426.0,4427.0, Maybe Jail.
4427.0,4428.0, No.
4428.0,4429.0, PGA.
4429.0,4430.0, Okay.
4430.0,4431.0," Scott knows, yeah."
4431.0,4432.0, Yeah.
4432.0,4433.0," Well, we know those guys."
4433.0,4434.0, We went to the chat with Frank Hound there.
4434.0,4436.0, They don't have got a lot of respect for them.
4436.0,4437.0, Yeah.
4437.0,4440.0, How about you guys haven't mentioned Viva Pinata yet?
4440.0,4442.0, That's your official.
4442.0,4444.0," I would copy, but I haven't played it yet."
4444.0,4445.0, That's so good.
4445.0,4446.0, I have some helpers.
4446.0,4448.0, It actually is real.
4448.0,4450.0, You need to have them to the rare guys.
4450.0,4453.0," It's actually just a beautiful, beautiful game."
4453.0,4455.0," Very, it's so, so engaging."
4455.0,4458.0," And no, I mean, I mean, my helpers were playing it all weekend."
4458.0,4461.0," And then, I'm still getting cries of, hey, it's time for a few to put."
4461.0,4462.0, Yeah.
4462.0,4463.0," No, that's not that."
4463.0,4464.0, I'm sorry.
4464.0,4465.0," Yes, that's not that."
4465.0,4466.0," Let me tell you, it's started."
4466.0,4467.0, You guys can please?
4467.0,4468.0," Oh, yeah."
4468.0,4470.0, Did you get weeds up in Canada?
4470.0,4471.0," Oh, yeah."
4471.0,4472.0, Yeah.
4472.0,4473.0, Do you all have them?
4473.0,4474.0, I've only got them in French Canada.
4474.0,4475.0, But I don't know.
4475.0,4476.0, No.
4476.0,4477.0," Oh, yeah."
4478.0,4481.0," I, you know, as I had this bizarre, is very,"
4481.0,4483.0," might at least, like, kind of not painful."
4483.0,4486.0," We, a cheap and experience."
4486.0,4488.0, And I kind of literally went to the local malls.
4488.0,4490.0," It was kind of like, there was an EB there."
4490.0,4492.0," As I was going on, and it was like, you know,"
4492.0,4493.0, I wasn't there for five a.m. or anything.
4493.0,4495.0, That's kind of stood in line for a couple hours.
4495.0,4497.0," And it was like, wow, that wasn't so bad."
4497.0,4499.0, Until I started talking to the guys in line.
4499.0,4502.0, And one guy was number 94 out of standing 93.
4502.0,4505.0," People got them, and all these other guys arrived."
4505.0,4507.0," And it's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's neat to get one."
4507.0,4509.0, And I think it's a pretty fun display.
4509.0,4511.0," Like, it's, that, it actually does work."
4511.0,4513.0," The whole concept behind it works, which is, which is,"
4513.0,4515.0, which is neat when you're found with the amount of games.
4515.0,4518.0," So I, I still have trouble pitching in the baseball game."
4518.0,4519.0, But I'm going to truly source.
4519.0,4521.0, And that's it.
4521.0,4522.0, And the ball.
4522.0,4523.0, And there's a funny faster.
4523.0,4524.0, So I'm trying to figure it.
4524.0,4526.0, And the one thing I was here is the office who had them.
4526.0,4527.0," So they explained, no, no, it's all the risk."
4527.0,4530.0," Yeah, that's because you're not from the USA, man."
4530.0,4532.0," In the USA, we know what I play baseball."
4532.0,4535.0," Oh, I don't know why I'm saying that."
4535.0,4536.0, I don't know.
4536.0,4538.0, I don't know why I'm saying that.
4538.0,4539.0, I don't know why I'm saying that.
4539.0,4540.0, I don't know.
4540.0,4541.0, Hard and hard.
4541.0,4542.0, I used to play baseball.
4542.0,4543.0, I haven't up here again.
4543.0,4544.0, And back.
4544.0,4546.0, I'm just giving you shit.
4546.0,4547.0," Wait, wait, wait, wait."
4547.0,4548.0," You're just, wait, wait."
4548.0,4550.0," Who was the MVP for the, the national league?"
4550.0,4552.0," I believe he was, but then, Canadian."
4552.0,4553.0, Dow.
4553.0,4556.0," I think he had a, at least in the,"
4556.0,4557.0, in the same place.
4557.0,4558.0, It was a pretty interesting thing.
4558.0,4561.0," We're, we're, in friends and, and, and, by-words, well,"
4561.0,4563.0, and a lot of American boys and biorems.
4563.0,4565.0," I hear, I hear the, I hear the challenge"
4565.0,4568.0, to be against the riddle versus the final piece.
4568.0,4571.0," Yeah, yeah, when, if you saw how athletic we were."
4571.0,4573.0," I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't."
4573.0,4574.0," I can't, I can't, I can't."
4574.0,4577.0, It's a bit sad here at this office.
4577.0,4579.0," Well, I will have a great week competition though."
4579.0,4583.0," Um, so it's, it's so, it's hard to get up there as it is here, huh?"
4583.0,4585.0, Pretty pretty pretty.
