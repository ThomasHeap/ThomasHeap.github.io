0.0,7.8," Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. This is the podcast for August 13th, 2008."
7.8,15.32, Hello. This is Jeff Green and her chief of the PC part of Wannup.com. And I'm here with
15.32,27.16, the usual gaggle of Marons and Deadbeats. And who are you? Don't you know? This is right.
27.16,32.8, So it can be one of those podcasts. It always is with Ryan.
32.8,38.16, Just go with the program. Next to Ryan is Robert Ashley.
38.16,43.24," Bobby, Dr. Max Chill, various other nicknames. Yeah, it's more yet again. So we had Bobby"
43.24,47.68," Joe. You know, the judge. And then you might be familiar with him. I never heard that."
47.68,52.44, With this. There's a company that's called Etoin that makes Green Tea. Yeah. So then
52.44,57.68, now it's Judgey Toe and Green Tea. That's like the latest mutation. He's like the tea virus.
57.68,60.64, Like that. She just can't catch it.
60.64,65.67999999999999, So anytime Sean calls me on the phone. He's calling me some new fucking nickname. Because
65.67999999999999,69.72," I don't know if you guys know this, but Sean calls me on the phone. And it's always like"
69.72,75.03999999999999, Bapito Bapito. It starts like going all this nonsense for like two minutes. It's a long
75.03999999999999,78.8, greeting. It's like it's like the kind of greeting that people would have when they used
78.8,83.08," to sail the seas, you know, for days before they would get somewhere and they'd have this"
83.08,86.88, elaborate ceremony. It sort of like that every time I'm on the street. Did you appreciate
86.88,92.2," the rap song about Yaddle about Yoda? Yeah, did you plan for your wife? I didn't plan"
92.2,96.4, for for Sarah now. Did you raise someone did you listen to it when they're tired? I wish
96.4,100.2, that I wish that they were on my phone at play and right now. I wish I had a phone message
100.2,105.8," on there. Yeah, you should have saved them. All right. I'll remember that next time. And"
105.8,109.88," I guess I introduced myself this is Sean. Right. And our special guest, which we thought"
109.88,116.72," we might have today. We didn't have, but we will have him soon. Also we have no. There's"
116.72,120.39999999999999, some weird hand signals going on here. Nostalgia. Just keep going. You don't see him.
120.39999999999999,126.4, You don't know. Behind we see. We don't have chuff love today. There's so no chuff. We also
126.4,130.32, wanted to get Rod Humboldt to join us to rejoin us. Right. He was a special guest.
130.32,134.48," Over this past weekend, I sort of like slapped myself in the head when I started, you know,"
134.56,139.23999999999998, I was looking at various writing about braid. And I was listening to a lecture by
139.23999999999998,143.88," Bray creator Johnson Blow that he gave the developed conference in Brighton, England. And"
143.88,150.2, he referenced an art game made by one rod humble. So they go. So it's just the same guy.
150.2,155.0," I looked it up. And of course, there's it seems that both Rod and Jonathan are, you"
155.0,159.56," know, used to communicating with one another. They common one and others blogs. And so"
159.56,162.35999999999999," there was just this whole angle. I feel bad not doing any research because you know,"
162.36,166.32000000000002," Rod came on, you know, more than I do. And you're like, you know, he's associated with"
166.32000000000002,170.0," sins and stuff. And I was like, let's just we ain't there. But there's a whole other side of"
170.0,174.32000000000002, him and his career that we didn't even get to discuss. So I were trying to get back on and
174.32000000000002,177.88000000000002," the perfect opportunity to talk about, you know, a lot of the other things he's doing that"
177.88000000000002,181.52," are sort of like off the radar that aren't officially officially, you know, EA product."
181.52,185.04000000000002," That's right. Yeah. He has kind of a whole, you know, our games are to think going on"
185.04000000000002,190.32000000000002," that he explores or how do you make them art and, you know, what what counts as art and"
190.32,195.44, EA kind of let him just do this thing on his own. So he has a separate website where
195.44,200.16," he's actually posted a couple of games that I guess you checked out, right? Yeah. I mean,"
200.16,203.4," this would be a good opportunity to start. I mean, because ultimately we're going to talk"
203.4,208.24," about braid, at least three years here played it. And so one of the games called the marriage"
208.24,214.07999999999998," is called the marriage. And one of the goals, one of Rod's stated goals that I think he"
214.07999999999998,219.32, shares with Jonathan Blow is a notion that gameplay itself can communicate some sort of
219.4,223.56," message, not message in the sense that it's didactic, like it's trying to teach you something."
223.56,228.35999999999999, But I almost look at these kind of games that they call art games. They're more just like
228.35999999999999,234.04," they're equivalent of parables to me. And so far as that they're very, very compacted in"
234.04,238.84," they allow for, you know, multitude of interpretations and they make you think for a second."
238.84,244.84," But it's like you don't spend the rest of your week thinking thinking on it, you know, but"
244.84,248.6," they show potential, I think of like things that can happen in games. So in the marriage"
248.68,253.16," in this case, it basically starts off. And the other aspect of this is that there's no external"
253.16,258.84, explanation to the game unless you go and seek it out. Unless you go and look at Rod's notes on
258.84,263.32," the game. Like if you start it, it's basically the game opens up. There's two boxes, a pink one,"
263.32,267.96," and a blue one, they're moving across this field. And then there are these other black and other"
267.96,273.8, colored objects that start to appear in the field. You have no indications as to like control or
273.8,278.04, anything. You just experiment and figure it out. Find out what the rules of the game are in the
278.12,284.52000000000004, process of figuring out the rules of the game. That's where it starts to impart some sort of
284.52000000000004,289.16, meaning or you assign some meaning to it. It's the interplay between the audience and the creator.
289.16,293.40000000000003," And in this case, you have the hint that it's called marriage. And then you see,"
293.40000000000003,297.16," here's a blue block, here's a pink block. Maybe this is the male, and this is the female."
297.16,301.64000000000004, And then what's their relationship? And what happens? And you figure out that you're this force of attraction
301.64000000000004,305.88, that the only thing you do is scroll your mouse over things and cause them to move in different ways
305.88,311.48, or to erase items and things like that. Either you guys played it. I looked at it but didn't
311.48,317.96, play it. I went to a side and peaked. It's about it. Another example why I tried is called the passage
317.96,324.2, by someone else and what does a name with me. I played that. I forget that guy's name. He also did
324.2,332.04, another game. Another like super tiny pixel game that was about just a quick storytelling experience.
332.68,338.68," We should look at it. And passage, I mean, it's basically the passage of a lifetime."
338.68,343.16, Yeah. And it's just this tiny bar that goes across the center of your monitor. And it's super
343.16,347.8," pixelated. You have a character recognized with character that you play. And at first, you're on the"
347.8,353.40000000000003," far left side of this bar and everything is laid out in front of you. And as you start walking,"
353.40000000000003,357.88, you're basically just going across this environment and you're able to move north and south
358.04,362.52, and you're basically moving across the world at the same time. And so you see that they're like
362.52,367.32, various treasure chests and stuff down in the south. But then the terrain becomes more complicated
367.32,372.04, and labyrinthine and you can go through mazes and get chests later on. You find that there's like
372.04,377.48," another, there's a female figure and you can partner up with that person by touching them or you"
377.48,380.44," can just keep on going and avoid it. And then what happens if you partner with that person,"
381.32,386.36, you have like an extended view of certain things. But that person is always like one step behind
386.36,389.72," you. And then that means that you're now able and you basically when you're controlling it,"
389.72,394.04, it counts as a single unit. So you can't navigate some aspects of the maze in the ways that you could
394.04,399.08000000000004, before that you have to basically work with the two characters as your single character. And as you
399.08000000000004,403.48," continue to move across this stage, you're getting older and behind you, you're also moving toward"
403.48,407.96000000000004, the right side of the screen. And there's more of the game that's visible on retrospect. And there is
407.96000000000004,414.76," like a future ahead of you. And I mean, it's pretty interesting. It's like, I mean, I don't"
414.84,419.4," know, I see what you thought when you played it. I mean, I really played a pair of parable,"
419.4,422.28," play for five minutes think about you're like, okay, I see what they're doing. When you start off"
422.28,426.59999999999997," young, you've got your future ahead of you, moves the other direction. When you have a partner,"
426.59999999999997,431.15999999999997," you gain something. But then at the risk of something, you're not able to just take your own path"
431.15999999999997,437.0," through these various, you know, lyrids and mazes to get these things. So part of the talk that's"
437.0,444.2," going on with these games is that the kind of ongoing endless debate that would go back, which"
444.28,450.28," way precedes this art form on the notion of, you know, if you don't know, if you go into it,"
450.28,456.03999999999996," not knowing the theory or the idea, can you appreciate it? Can a lay person open up this game"
456.03999999999996,460.52, and get any enjoyment out of it or understand what it's even about if they weren't explained in
460.52,465.48," advance what the artist was trying to do? I mean, did you get any sense playing either of these things?"
466.68,470.91999999999996," It was very bad. Yeah, read about them before you played them. In the case of the marriage ahead,"
470.92,477.0," so that wasn't a good read. But with the passage I hadn't, Nick Sutner just told me to try it."
477.0,482.76," So I did without any preconceptions or anything. It seemed, I mean, obviously everyone's going to"
482.76,486.36," have a slightly different reading. That's part of the point as well, you know. It's pretty, it's"
486.36,490.68, pretty open. You're so to Jeff. Okay. And I want to make a little cookie noise while you're
490.68,496.20000000000005," being all smart sounding. But anyway, it's pretty, it's pretty out and open passage. I mean,"
496.20000000000005,500.28000000000003," it's a weird game that takes a little bit when you first open it if you never heard of it,"
500.28,505.55999999999995," because if first you don't even know what you're looking at because this guy, his games are made"
505.55999999999995,511.96," in super, super low-fi 2D. So it's literally like 80 pixels by 80 pixels. You know, it's hard to"
511.96,516.92, even tell what you're looking at at first and what you can do in the world. And the other stuff
517.64,523.64, sort of becomes apparent as you're going through. And it has music and it's sort of like hinting
523.64,530.92," at what you should be feeling in the music. Right. Yeah, they're like, I see like a lot of"
530.92,535.24," potential on these, but they just really remind me of exploratory sketches that an artist might"
535.24,539.96," undertake as they're working towards some larger project getting some place, you know? Yeah."
539.96,543.0," And I think that that's basically how, you know, Rod and the people they're creating these"
543.0,547.4," view on this. Right. Well, yeah. But I mean, there's something about it, too. It's like, you know,"
547.4,550.52," like when I'm playing even marriage, you know, you basically just have these different shape colors."
550.68,556.76," And you're basically writing a metaphor on top of moving blocks and and re seeing them as a relationship,"
556.76,560.76," you know? And it kind of reminds me in a way of like, you familiar with Pings and Mark Rothko,"
560.76,565.56, but just big giant enormous paintings of just color fields. Sometimes I'll have vibrating.
567.24,572.84, What is it called? A complimentary colors? They really stand out and see each other and see.
572.84,576.12," And sometimes what happens like if you do, if you put like a really sharp blue against a really"
576.76,581.16," sharp red and a green and a blue against a yellow or something, that their border will start to"
581.16,585.08," actually vibrate, creates the illusion of vibration or something. But anyway, in these paintings,"
585.64,590.92, people profess to stand in front of them and break down in tears and in all this sort of thing.
590.92,595.5600000000001," And I look at them and it's like, it's kind of a neat form of form of a formal point of view. It's like"
595.5600000000001,600.6800000000001," it's neat. Yeah. But it's like, I just never made the brai. I can appreciate art."
601.56,605.0799999999999, The board? Yeah. Yeah. You're the board. I'm part of the board.
605.0799999999999,611.0799999999999," Like, what kind of do you like data or Star Trek? I don't know. Everyone reacts differently to things."
611.0799999999999,615.3199999999999, I usually cried when I see paintings. You see Mark Rothko's? Yeah. I don't know. I'm just
615.3199999999999,623.0799999999999, used by five years. I don't know that. I've ever like been emotionally affected by a painting period.
623.0799999999999,628.5999999999999," By anyone? Yeah. It's just not my thing. Yeah. You know, like a music person. What's really"
628.6,633.32, fun? It's to go to museums and get angry at paintings. Yeah. That's all. There's always that person
633.32,639.0," that's in here. There's like, or no, no, the usual one, like, my fucking kid could have done that."
639.0,643.96, Yeah. That guy isn't every art music museum of modern art. That was that documentary. They
643.96,648.6800000000001," came out a little while ago about this prodigy, some little kid, little kid prodigy. Somebody listening"
648.6800000000001,652.84, is going to know what I'm talking about. I can't remember the name of it. They make a documentary
652.84,657.8000000000001," about it. It's a little girl, right? Right. And it's like the documentary is called like my"
658.12,663.8, kid kid. My kid could paint this. Yeah. And it's about that the kid was touted as being this genius.
663.8,668.4399999999999," Artists and other people were saying, yeah. Yeah. This is like, you know, little kid watercutter,"
668.4399999999999,673.64," color doodles or whatever. So yeah. Well, I mean, it just goes to show like how much the, you know,"
673.64,679.4," someone's reaction to something is important. You know, that's the handshake of the deal that"
679.4,684.4399999999999," art makes, you know. There's also promotion. You're all your time like making something, making"
684.5200000000001,691.24," a painting or music or whatever. But unless somebody decides to come along and give themselves to it,"
691.24,696.0400000000001," then it's, you know, it's nothing. So I think there's like, there's the interpretation of"
696.0400000000001,700.2800000000001," Flexibility. There's also just like the way that things are promoted. Like it sounds like in this movie,"
700.2800000000001,706.36," like this girl basically had the equivalent of an agent. You know, it's not like someone just walks"
706.36,710.0400000000001," into a random kindergarten. So that's not it. That's not it. That's like, hey, you kid come with me."
710.0400000000001,713.8800000000001," Like, I mean, they're so exactly promoting. And you look at it now. It's even more obvious than"
713.88,718.4399999999999," ever in the internet area where it's like people like they cover the, the woman on the cover of"
718.4399999999999,723.16, the most recent issue of wired magazine. This is basically someone who just made herself famous by
723.16,728.2," telling people she's famous. So, but I mean, this is a lot like two. I mean, I think even podcasting"
728.2,731.56," is like, you know, we, we notice this when we first started writing a magazine and start podcasting,"
731.56,735.56," it's like, we get so much more attention just by telling people they should pay attention to us"
736.2,741.24," on the podcast and I just think that like, yeah. And then, you know, how about, when we went to"
742.2,747.5600000000001," to the Metro on a local place in San Francisco yesterday and we walked by the, those art people."
747.5600000000001,751.5600000000001," Like, if you guys, do you remember this? Were you, yeah, they had the same empty picture frame thing?"
751.5600000000001,757.16," Right. And then there was a Volkswagen, like on this is right in front of the, of the"
757.16,762.52," Momma, the modern art museum in San Francisco. And right, you know, off the sidewalk, there's a"
762.52,768.76," old Volkswagen that's up on display there. So, what's somehow a some kind of artistic statement"
769.72,773.3199999999999," expressing some kind of theory. But then in front of that, there were some people holding an"
773.3199999999999,778.04," empty picture frame and then, yeah, people sticking their heads inside of it and other people taking pictures"
778.04,783.96," of them. But I think because they had that part of the group was there to act as a spectator,"
783.96,787.88," that encouraged other people to stop and see what was going on. So, like, we couldn't get by the"
787.88,792.28," sidewalk because there was a bunch of people looking. Yeah. And it's kind of like, I mean, this is"
792.28,795.64," more the audience saying it's like, but because it's another way of indicating something's worth"
795.72,799.0," your attention. Like, if you go walking through the art museum again, you see people just stand"
799.0,803.24," in for half an hour in front of a painting and you look at it and you're like, I don't know,"
803.24,806.92, I just feel like I digested that like five seconds. Why don't I need to stand there? But people might
806.92,811.08," feel compelled to. And then another thing, too, it's been proven. Like, you just go and you have"
811.08,814.36," people who form a line, you're like three of five people in the street form a line. And next thing,"
814.36,817.88," you know, you got like 40 people behind them. Right. No one can answer what they're in line for."
817.88,822.4399999999999," Right. I mean, I do think people need context. Maybe we'd like to think that like, we're all"
822.5200000000001,827.24," smart enough to know what's genius and what we should pay attention to and what we, what we"
827.24,832.36," shouldn't. But I mean, over and over again, you know, we proved that wrong. I mean, the Washington"
832.36,837.96, Post did that story last year that won them a Pulitzer where they took this violin virtually
837.96,843.5600000000001," was who was in town in DC to play the Kennedy Center. He was, you know, known all over the world"
843.5600000000001,848.36," and people in his, his both, you know, both nights in DC were sold out and everyone wanted to"
848.36,854.36, come see him play. They took him down to the metro station in downtown and had him play. And people
854.36,858.12," just passed right by the videotaped, you know, it's down for an hour. You don't just go off to"
858.12,862.04," right by it because, you know, they need, they need for it to be in the concert hall. The"
862.04,867.88," perception was just with some deadbeat street busker. Right. You know, and it's, and it's all just"
867.88,873.72," because, you know, it's not art until, you know, you stop and, and, and declare it to be and give"
873.72,877.5600000000001," it your attention. I mean, and the context though there, because I mean, we have some really"
877.56,883.16," telling musicians that play in the barge stations here. Like there's the, the, what does he plays?"
884.1199999999999,888.04," For you would it, this is how, how much attention I've made him. I think is this like a saxophone?"
888.04,891.2399999999999," He plays high down here at the, you know, right in our station. He's almost there every morning"
891.2399999999999,896.28," plays the sax. And he's very talented. But as you're passing through there, you're on your way"
896.28,900.68," to, you're in transit and you're usually in a hurry. I'm trying to get, so I can grab a bag on and"
900.68,904.04," then get up to the office so I'm not the latest one on hand, you know, and it's like the different"
904.04,907.9599999999999," of, like, if you went to sit down to performance, you're like, okay, I'm going with the expectation"
907.9599999999999,911.88," that I'm going to sit and pay attention this bit. Like, yeah, you know, when I was in high school,"
911.88,919.0," and I was in the jazz band me and two other guys, all three of us were Jewish. This one Saturday,"
919.0,924.36," we, we went and we took some of some of the bandage instruments that we don't play. Like,"
924.36,929.0," but we all played on horns, so, you know, the mouthpiece is kind of similar. We took like a two-butt"
929.0,933.24," and a trombone and I forget what else, and, you know, we were trumpet players. We went down to the"
933.32,941.48," local mall and as a joke, we just started playing Christmas carols and badly, you know,"
941.48,945.72," as we didn't really know how to play these instruments. And, yeah, we are Jewish. It was just sort of a"
945.72,950.52," job. We decided, let's do this. And people started giving us money. And we hadn't put money,"
950.52,954.52," we hadn't put a thing out of hat. People were just like throwing money at your feet. Yeah, so then"
954.52,958.36," we just realized, man, if we just like put a hat out or something like we can make some money,"
959.32,963.72, just have your practice sessions out there. Exactly. Yeah. Go through your schedule.
963.72,969.64," Was it even during Christmas time? No, yeah, so it was okay. Okay, so yeah, because that would be"
969.64,976.92," kind of weird. Yeah, then we pushed our lock because then we went back to school and one of us had"
976.92,981.32, so much fun playing the tuba that we went and found a couple more tubas on the day that the
981.32,985.88," music instructor was sick, you know, so it was a substitute music teacher, which is a like, you know,"
986.68,991.4, music classes already kind of a zoo. So this was substitutes. Everybody is fucking around. So the
991.4,995.48, three of us were all playing tubas. The whole day and the whole band was cracking out because we were
995.48,1001.16," terrible and just we were making up, um, pop parts to stuff. And the teacher came back, the actual"
1001.16,1005.96," teacher came back the next day and he was, he was in front of the class and he said, well, I got a"
1005.96,1010.68," really good, a good, really good report from the substitute that you guys were all very well behaved."
1010.68,1016.68, And especially well behaved was the tuba section.
1018.68,1023.88, Back to back to back to the white all that story. Where am I? Go back to back to all the games
1023.88,1027.72," and work are way to grade from there. No, I mean, not our games, but just like we were talking about,"
1027.72,1032.28," you know, games that try to tell story through gameplay. That's not exactly, you know, a"
1032.28,1037.0," property exclusively owned by small time indie developers. People are doing that all the time. Now,"
1037.08,1041.48," you look at like, I mean, we talked about this as being a real detracting moment in metal gear"
1041.48,1047.8," solid for, but they're definitely going for it. When, you know, spoiler alert, um, old snake is crawling"
1047.8,1053.32," through the, the radiated chamber and all of this suit is coming apart and he's, you know,"
1053.32,1057.96," dying and crushing green and you're mashing the butt. I mean, they're definitely going for"
1057.96,1062.04," something like that. Yeah, we should differentiate like, what do you say art games? This is what"
1062.04,1065.4," the people that are creating and we're calling them and the differences that, but I think they're"
1065.48,1070.3600000000001," probably just a little more ostentatious about this fact that that's their sole reason to exist,"
1070.3600000000001,1075.16," whereas with like metal gear, it's incorporating that into it and sometimes naturally, sometimes not"
1075.16,1079.16," so, but it's also doing all these other things and trying to make, like basically just something"
1079.16,1083.5600000000002," that can entertain anyone that can play it, you know. Yeah, I don't know if it's all, all these guys are,"
1083.5600000000002,1087.5600000000002," you know, going around saying, I make art games. I mean, I think it's, it's a lot of the reaction"
1087.5600000000002,1092.2800000000002," from the public. I think people are saying I make indie games, you know, I don't know if everyone"
1092.36,1096.68," is really like putting on the beret and, right? No, they're not, but in the case of like what Rod is doing"
1096.68,1101.3999999999999," here, this was like, I'm going to demonstrate a theory to you. Yeah, I mean, he was consciously doing."
1101.3999999999999,1104.92," Yeah. Other things like, are there any other reasons for the kind of like that? Another,"
1104.92,1108.76," I was just going to say another, another moment, and a recent game of God of War,"
1108.76,1115.0," chains of Olympus, if you get to the end of it, spoiler alert, others of that moment, where you get to"
1115.8799999999999,1119.96," the underworld and you're there with your daughter and your daughter, you know, this moment and the"
1120.76,1126.76," series that you know, the creato's has been wanting to get back as family and the daughter is"
1126.76,1131.8," grasping onto his leg and you have to like, you have to push your daughter off so you can go kill"
1131.8,1136.76," some dude and it's really me and it's like, your daughter's like, Daddy, no, no, and you have to,"
1136.76,1141.56," you know, basically kick your daughter off and and leave her behind forever and, you know,"
1141.56,1144.92," that's just a similar kind of right. But there's a difference there in that, like, I mean,"
1145.0,1150.2," that's almost like, Mimesis where it's trying to copy with a physical action that's trying to"
1150.2,1154.1200000000001," imitate it through the mode of interaction or in the case of marriage, what it's trying to do is that"
1154.8400000000001,1158.92, every bit of mean that can be obtained from the experience of playing the game is entirely
1159.72,1164.04," contained in just the interactive aspect of it. There's not, there's no one screaming,"
1164.04,1168.6000000000001," there's no recognizable like daughter saying that she loves you, you know, you know, I mean,"
1168.6000000000001,1172.1200000000001," but it's similar and and dude, it's, there's been so many cases of two of you, you know,"
1172.12,1176.52," psychonauts has levels that are basically the act of playing the levels, how you understand"
1176.52,1181.1599999999999," a character, I mean the level itself is a character, you know, other forms, I mean,"
1181.1599999999999,1185.8799999999999," other sort of mergers of form and content like and sport coming up, I mean, you get this game"
1185.8799999999999,1191.56," about evolution and at the same time it works as like another version of the evolution of game design,"
1191.56,1197.6399999999999," you know, simplicity. The bridge is totally not independent of, you know, other things. It's not entirely"
1198.6000000000001,1204.3600000000001," it's not, no, break is not, break is many, many steps like the way from marriage and yeah,"
1205.24,1209.8000000000002," and it's sort of weird actually, I mean, because sometimes I mean, you, you sort of writing about,"
1211.48,1216.3600000000001," you know, feeling that the game play was disconnected somehow from the story that it was trying to tell"
1217.64,1222.2," I've come to think with like a different, see my thing I have to get out there's I haven't finished the"
1222.28,1227.72, game and I'm glad you have so that that way because now I've got like all these ideas because
1227.72,1231.56," I've sort of been following it. I got to the point where I just was like, I like this and I"
1231.56,1237.56," appreciate it, but the act of actually playing it, that wasn't really that encroached into the point"
1237.56,1241.48, where I wanted to continue and then there's other things too. Some of it's just been time. Things
1241.48,1247.72," come off and I've like, you know, went out when I, I actually was like super compelled by the"
1247.8,1253.0," game. I mean, when I, when I first started playing it for like the first hour, I wasn't sure about it,"
1253.0,1257.24, like the puzzles didn't really click with me or anything and then when I went back the next day
1257.24,1262.28, and it was playing like for five hours and and being the game and then I went back and played through
1262.28,1269.64, it again because I'm in her and I just really enjoyed it on strictly like a puzzle adventure game
1269.64,1275.16," kind of level, although I also like after playing through it twice became sort of enamored with"
1275.24,1280.68, trying to figure out what the fuck was going on with the story and obsessing about that and reading
1280.68,1284.76," message board posts with all the other people, you know, trying to figure out what was going on"
1284.76,1290.76," and all the weird theories cropping up with people, you know, describing like the nautical flags that"
1290.76,1296.3600000000001," that pop up at the end of the level and you know, making all these theories about the sort of weird"
1296.3600000000001,1301.24," nuclear weapons, term, I mean, like references and stuff that pop up up toward the end of the game."
1302.2,1307.4," I don't know, that's a very good even on the cynical, I don't think that it was like calculation"
1307.4,1311.56," on blow as part, but I think it's a good time to get away with this sort of thing. I mean,"
1311.56,1315.24," I don't know how many people have actually downloaded the game now, but I mean with like the"
1315.24,1321.08, popularity of shows and like lost and stuff and people love to basically like just the crypto
1321.08,1327.16," mania, you know, they love like just that this element of things and so I mean the nautical flags and"
1327.16,1331.0," all that, I mean it's just feeding into the same part that like makes Ryan speculate that"
1331.0,1336.1200000000001, it was the dog that was the ghost in the cabin and lost. That's the most frustrating thing to me
1336.1200000000001,1340.92," that was like you playing the game like that, you know, it's a game where every puzzle has and"
1340.92,1346.92," has a solution. Yeah. And the solution is really clean, you know, like every everything makes a lot of"
1346.92,1352.2, sense to me and I've found that aspect of it really satisfying even even I had two puzzles that
1352.2,1357.88," had a sheet on and even those when I you know when I figured them out I was like, oh mother fucker,"
1357.88,1362.52," you know. Yeah, I haven't cheated yet, but I definitely feel the need to because I feel too dumb for"
1362.52,1366.8400000000001," that game. But I haven't put in enough hours yet. I mean, I hear the same thing that you said that"
1366.8400000000001,1372.68," at some point it clicks. Yeah. And it does not click for me yet, which may mean I'm just too stupid for"
1372.68,1377.32, the game or I just haven't spent enough time with it. But there's there's puzzle pieces I'm looking
1377.32,1383.96, at and I'm just like there's I just don't see it at all. Yeah. I think there's a potential reading
1383.96,1388.6799999999998, that I have that makes that make sense for that to be the case. And I should just throw it out there
1388.6799999999998,1392.6799999999998," and then you can tell me what sense it makes to you having actually played it. In this case,"
1392.6799999999998,1396.6799999999998," like when I said I've finished that I have I have looked at the video of the final level, the"
1396.6799999999998,1402.04," upload, I've looked at the transcript of, you know, the final text, you know, portion of the game"
1402.04,1410.92," and stuff. But, um, so what to go with this? So I know a few different things about from previous"
1410.92,1414.6," interviews with Jonathan Blow, he says he claimed that Mahal and Drive is his favorite movie of all"
1414.6,1419.1599999999999," time, which I think is very telling. Yeah. Not just like hey, by the way, I like this movie. This is my"
1419.1599999999999,1425.0, favorite movie. It is a great movie of all time. And the thing with that movie is that it tells the
1425.08,1432.6," tale of an actor who, I mean, the movie is presented in the form of their fantasy, their retelling"
1432.6,1436.28," of their own life and it turns out the end that they're, you know, they're on the verge of suicide."
1436.28,1441.24," They've been a total failure, but it's just this really weird mix of sometimes, you know, horrific"
1441.24,1448.28," surreal elements and really just like, you know, wide eye at Hollywood, Starlet, type of scenario."
1448.28,1454.04," But anyway, but the, the game, the movie is very cleverly structured. Yeah. So when people"
1454.12,1457.32," started saying, well, there's all this stuff later on at the end and the epilogue that"
1458.12,1462.68," in there showing these quotes and it sounded a whole lot like, you know, um, like the Manhattan"
1462.68,1467.96," project and like, you know, open-heimer and, you know, had all these illusions that are very clearly,"
1467.96,1472.52," you know, talking about, you know, I'm become death, the story or worlds and hiding behind, you know,"
1472.52,1477.3999999999999," blast, put it, you basically putting welders, goggles on to seeing explosion and stuff. And so"
1478.44,1483.3999999999999," when I saw that, and there's that post is on the RLL and UK, whatever that means forms is where"
1483.48,1487.64," that, you know, I think where people first started sort of like looking and seeing someone pointing"
1487.64,1492.6000000000001," out that these are in this game. They're like, well, this game is an allegory for like, it's just,"
1492.6000000000001,1497.5600000000002," it's, um, it's a metaphor for the making of the atomic bomb. What I was like, well, let's look at"
1497.5600000000002,1503.8000000000002," it the other way. I mean, what if, um, the, the real fact of the matter, to that's almost the"
1503.8000000000002,1508.8400000000001, Rosetta Stone and that's the reality that it is a story about someone who made an atomic weapon
1508.8400000000001,1513.16, or something like this. And then everything else you're experiencing is the construa
1513.24,1518.68," mental construction, the retelling of whatever, you know, to make sense of his own history and"
1518.68,1522.6000000000001," all these other things to repress certain things, to rewrite aspects and stuff and it works that way."
1523.4,1527.48, And there's a few things that make the seem to work. There's also Mary Shelley Frankenstein
1527.48,1533.0," references in, um, in the game where specifically the parts about how, you know, Dr. Frankenstein"
1533.0,1537.0800000000002, wanted to basically just pull apart the tissue and pierce the inner workings of the world and
1537.08,1544.6799999999998," of life itself, you know. And of course, in that story, Frankenstein has the scientific genius,"
1544.6799999999998,1549.48," but there's, he's an ethical and moral midget. He has no concern for the ramifications or no ability"
1549.48,1553.8799999999999," to anticipate it. And then, of course, once he does develop the monster, it's out of his hands."
1553.8799999999999,1558.1999999999998," It's gone in the same way that Oppenheimer Security clearance was revoked and, of course,"
1558.1999999999998,1563.6399999999999, the tonic weapons went over to another group of people in the US government. And then there's
1563.72,1568.2800000000002," like this other level of connection between those, you know, Mary Shelley Frankenstein's subtitle"
1568.2800000000002,1572.92, is a modern Prometheus and then Oppenheimer's biography. He's been called an American Prometheus
1572.92,1578.2800000000002," and stuff. This is notion of someone trying to produce something in being, you know, being"
1578.2800000000002,1581.24," punished for it or not getting it. So it's taking of it and I'm like, well, could you maybe put"
1581.24,1585.48," together this notion that saying that games are kind of like this, you know, we've got all these"
1585.48,1590.44," complicated physics. We've got, you know, bloom lighting and all these things, but at the end of the"
1590.52,1595.3200000000002," day, what are we using for? Is there any sort of like, you know, intelligence or morality or just"
1595.3200000000002,1601.96," like, significant to all this, you know? And then when you look at it, that when you know, it's also"
1601.96,1606.52," very important for Johnson Blow to have the gameplay itself correlate to whatever it is,"
1606.52,1612.8400000000001," he, whatever meanings he has in the story, like, well, people, you know, physicists and stuff are"
1612.8400000000001,1616.92," are well known for working in a counterintuitive mode of thought, you know, people, when people"
1617.0,1621.3200000000002," are involved, we're involved to understand the world on, like, on a cell, you know, not a cell,"
1621.3200000000002,1626.3600000000001," like a level of animal organisms and objects, things we see and interact with, but not on a molecular"
1626.3600000000001,1631.16," level, not on a quantum level for sure, you know. And so when you hear about people like Einstein's"
1631.16,1634.92," now working with all these things with time, it's like they just, most of us just can't grasp,"
1634.92,1638.8400000000001," but it's beyond our thinking. But so when you play the game, I have that there's this like doubling"
1638.8400000000001,1646.76," experience because it has a very consistent internal logic in the gameplay mechanisms, but it's kind of"
1646.84,1651.0," alien to us when we play it. And I think when you first saw the puzzle, you do get it, you're like,"
1651.0,1655.16," yeah, of course you're able to force yourself to learn these rules, but if you were to write"
1655.16,1659.08," then and there to explain to someone, saw him like Robert, what are you doing? Why did you do all"
1659.08,1664.12," those steps? Why was that exact, the order of operations you chose? Maybe at that moment,"
1664.12,1667.72, it might be difficult for you to explain. So it's kind of like just to someone's like this
1667.72,1671.64, like sublingual. It's just kind of like I'm saying there's a mode of thought that you could
1671.64,1676.68," probably, maybe it's defensible to say, you're in the mindset playing this game that kind of loosely"
1677.4,1680.3600000000001," correlates to someone of physicists or something like that, you know."
1681.0800000000002,1684.92," And the interesting thing about that is everyone's got these really emotional responses to the game,"
1684.92,1688.44," and that's like the story and stuff, but like for me that's what the whole time I was playing,"
1688.44,1692.68," I was like taking an IQ test or something, you know. And I think that could be the point. I mean,"
1692.68,1697.48," this is according to this reading, that might be the point. I mean, which is again, as why I was bad at it."
1698.44,1704.68," It was an IQ test. I don't think it's an IQ test. I mean, the puzzle really aren't so crazy,"
1704.76,1710.04," but beyond that, to me, like there's a frustration, like I don't, you know, this is like,"
1710.04,1715.48, I don't think the story is something that he even like intended people to analyze.
1715.48,1721.3200000000002," So obviously, he didn't intend for people to analyze, but not to come up with anything real, you know."
1721.3200000000002,1725.72, And it's like this built-in frustration because it's a puzzle game where all you have all the answers
1725.72,1731.0800000000002, to all the puzzles except for the one of like what the fuck is this game about. And the only thing that
1731.1599999999999,1742.36," really comes through for me is this weird, like, you know, creeping sense of the world being fucked up."
1742.9199999999998,1748.04," You know, you start out and it's in like super Mario World and it just gets more and more fucked up,"
1748.04,1753.48," you know, in the music, it gets more and more fucked up as it gets mangled by the different time effects,"
1753.8799999999999,1759.56," becomes like really ugly, even though it's just, you know, nice like string quartet and horns and stuff."
1760.52,1766.9199999999998," And I don't know that it just has this, as you think it's sub-lingual, but it's me, it's never going to have any meaning."
1766.9199999999998,1774.28," That the, just in terms of the gameplay element that the, what this game did to me at the beginning was,"
1774.28,1778.6799999999998," and I had to go on a message board to realize I was just so off-base was I realized that my,"
1779.3999999999999,1787.24," my learned language of how to play a game did not, it did not prepare me right for how to play this game."
1787.32,1790.6," Because I went through the, the first world at which I guess is World 2."
1791.32,1797.32," And I saw the things that seemed completely out of reach and my natural inclination was to think,"
1797.32,1803.4," just from years and years of gameplay, while I'll be able to come back to this later once I have that ability to do that thing."
1804.04,1808.84," I don't have it yet, you know, so I'm just going to skip it. Clearly I can't jump that high."
1808.84,1813.4," Clearly there's no way to get over there. So this is meant to be, this is like Mario World 12."
1813.4,1818.8400000000001," That's, yeah, that is standard like game rights and then eventually that's what you get some other power."
1818.8400000000001,1823.4," Right. So I kept going through the game and I wasn't getting more powers. You know, I hadn't read anything about the game."
1823.4,1827.8000000000002," I didn't read anything. So I just was, I just kept going. I was like, I was just skipping shit."
1827.8000000000002,1833.0," Because it's like, well, there's no way I could do this yet. Yeah. And then as I was continuing to not get more powers,"
1833.0,1838.76," I finally, finally looked at the, I was like, I got to look at the controls. Like, maybe there's going to be hint in there that there's more,"
1838.84,1843.72," because I can see her jump or something. And then there's nothing. So then I, then I was like, well, wait,"
1843.72,1848.04," I'm just like not playing this game right. So then I went up to a couple of message boards. It basically,"
1848.04,1852.92," we're saying I was trying to not cheat and I didn't yet, but basically that we're telling me,"
1854.92,1858.92," well, you can beat every puzzle from your first go through and every screen."
1859.48,1862.84," Well, there is in the, in the second world, their first world, whatever you want to call it,"
1862.9199999999998,1869.0," thing where you have to pass it, like the, when you come, there is a power, the ring. They put you off."
1869.0,1875.0," No, they put you off off the trailer first because that first level, when you would be thinking that"
1875.0,1880.9199999999998," there's a puzzle that you can't solve until you have enough pieces in, in, in, in the area where you pass,"
1880.9199999999998,1886.12," and there's a picture frame within. Oh, that one. You have to have the right. Oh, you can't,"
1886.12,1890.12," yeah, can't do that. So you do have to pass that one. And that made me think that's,"
1890.12,1895.9599999999998," wait, it's been fucking hour there. I kept jumping off the, my team might have the pieces."
1896.6799999999998,1904.52," Okay. But yeah, I thought that was kind of a funny or mean thing to do because it's true that"
1904.52,1909.32," for the rest of the game, you really should just, you know, stick in the room that you come to and"
1909.32,1914.9199999999998," and find the solution. That's what I did for the, for the entire game. I got, I got really"
1914.9199999999998,1919.9599999999998," obsessed with it and, and, uh, would just, you know, play around until I found it."
1920.04,1923.72, I've been waiting to back up for a second because I do think I disagree with you about
1925.72,1930.52," the way that the game could have a half meaning or something. Now, first thing I want to say that like,"
1931.32,1935.56," I do believe it's deliberately ambiguous. And I think they're almost all like, I mean,"
1935.56,1939.4," I'm not even saying this is a great work of art, but great works are especially the kind that, you know,"
1939.4,1945.24," I'm sure like the blow wants to be like, but his own version, you know, um, they're ambiguous."
1945.56,1949.64," But that ambiguity doesn't mean that anything goes, that anyone, and I see this a lot of"
1949.64,1953.32," lines, like, well, this is what I think it is. This is what I think it is. And there's no need to like,"
1953.32,1959.08," actually support it with, you know, evidence from the game, you know, or anything. And it's like,"
1959.08,1963.4," I mean, it's, because at that point, then you can just say like, you know, just take the most"
1964.44,1968.04," series case of abstract expressionism or something. And, you know, you'll get Jackson Pollock and"
1968.04,1971.08," you're like, well, this is like, Hiroshima, and so on. I was just like, no, this is like,"
1971.96,1977.08," like a capillaries and then like, this is, you know, a heart and all this stuff like this."
1977.08,1980.84," And at the point, like, if it's everything that everyone, it's like, whatever, why this painting,"
1980.84,1986.76," then anything else. And so what I think, though, is that like, I'm pretty convinced he has the"
1986.76,1991.48, number of ideas in mind. It's not like a Rosetta Stone type thing where you break it down to a
1991.48,1996.76, one to one. You've decoded it where the whole game itself is a puzzle that has a single solution.
1996.84,2002.12," Yeah. But what if it's a puzzle that's got maybe three, four or five? No, I agree with that."
2002.12,2006.68," Sustainable readings or interpretations. What I mean is like, I'm never going to think like,"
2006.68,2010.44," braid is about this. Because there are moments in moment, you know, there's a moment in the"
2010.44,2017.64," game where it does feel like you're, you know, going after some some, you know, ex girlfriend or"
2017.64,2022.84," you're you're regretting, you know, some some break up or something. And then there's, you know,"
2022.9199999999998,2026.84," moments later in the game, like, I thought at the end of the game where you come out of this"
2026.84,2031.08," epilogue where you're talking about all this nuclear shit and you come out of the front door,"
2031.08,2036.04," back to the beginning of the screen and you realize that the city that you thought was like,"
2036.04,2040.76, city at twilight. And it was just this really impressionistic version of the city at twilight.
2040.76,2044.6799999999998," You come out and it looks like the city blowing up. Right. Yeah. And that, I mean, like,"
2044.6799999999998,2049.3199999999997," I mean, there are like moments in the game that mean something. But it's just like the idea of like"
2049.32,2054.2000000000003," piecing it together to be anything in particular. It's not like it's not worth talking about,"
2054.2000000000003,2058.84," but, but it's just, but it's frustrating me. Those are, they're, they're multiple, like,"
2059.7200000000003,2063.48," sort of, you know, what I've been calling illusions that fit that bill, that like this is like an"
2063.48,2067.0800000000004," atomic experiment type thing or someone that worked on this kind of thing. And it's not like,"
2067.0800000000004,2070.92, there's a difference between safe. There was one illusion of that. Then there was another illusion
2070.92,2075.7200000000003," to like just any random thing you want to like cis aro or to, you know, you just start like,"
2075.7999999999997,2081.3999999999996," I mean, they're suggesting a solution and they're suggesting something. And I think also,"
2081.3999999999996,2086.4399999999996," I mean, even, you know, like Jonathan, when you know, he was talking to Matt Shanner today and stuff,"
2086.4399999999996,2091.08," you know, from the one up show. I mean, you could tell he was like, you could tell he was the sort of"
2091.08,2096.6, creator who did have something particular in mind. And he's waiting for the critics or someone
2096.6,2101.56," in his audience to get what he hopes people will get out of it. And he even said as much. He's like,"
2101.56,2107.64," I'm surprised no one's really put this together or said this, you know, like, he could just tell us."
2109.72,2113.88," That would that would be failure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you have to."
2113.88,2117.88," But so it's just, I mean, it's not like totally, yeah, it's just, it's the difference between like,"
2117.88,2123.4," I definitely, I'm not of the sort of person, the things that like, it's all arbitrary and you can read"
2123.4,2126.84," whatever you want on top of it. If that was the case, there would be the difference between this and like,"
2126.84,2131.24," say, Super Mario Brothers, we could say, well, Super Mario Brothers to me represents, you know,"
2131.3199999999997,2135.3199999999997," like, man's like, this or that, you could talk to him, talked to whatever thing you wanted."
2135.3199999999997,2139.9599999999996," And why would it be any different than, than, brave, you know, if there wasn't something there that"
2140.7599999999998,2145.4799999999996," came together in a more significant way than just people's imagination, you know. Yeah."
2147.16,2151.08, I don't know. I've enjoyed it a lot and I would say that it's probably my favorite puzzle game.
2151.08,2156.52," Yeah. Yeah. Like I enjoyed it as a puzzle game, more than I enjoyed portal as a puzzle game. I enjoyed it"
2157.08,2160.68," more than I enjoy the puzzles in that game, more than I enjoy the puzzles and I enjoyed the puzzles"
2160.68,2167.8," and pretty much any forget venture game. Yeah. I'm finding it's to me, it's not holding"
2167.8,2173.08, up to a game like portal so far. But it might be my own frustration with not solving the puzzles.
2175.24,2183.56," But I also, you know, I tend to lean towards wanting humor and I'm finding this to be a rather"
2183.64,2189.4, joyless experience so far. Yeah. It's not humorous. That's for sure. Yeah. It's a little unsightling.
2191.16,2196.68," And there are times when the writing is a bit, it's a bit much, but the whole thing, the whole"
2196.68,2202.84," things a bit portentious. And the little pretentious, I should say, just a little. I mean, even"
2202.84,2208.84," though, you know, when you go to the, uh, did you guys try going to the walk through site, have you been there?"
2208.92,2214.6000000000004," Yeah. And you know, he helps you, you know, you get this visual looks like you're going to be"
2214.6000000000004,2219.4," reading a strategy guide, you know, pretty much strategy guide or whatever. And you know, it's solving"
2219.4,2223.56," the first puzzle or two, which are basically not puzzles, you know, the easy stuff. And then you start"
2223.56,2227.32," getting into the world too and you're like, okay, here's where we're going to start getting spoilers."
2227.32,2232.84," And he says, you know, and now whatever, I forget how he phrased it, but it's like, and now it's time"
2232.84,2237.1600000000003," for you to think or whatever. And I mean, he basically then goes on to lecture you for your few more"
2237.24,2241.24," lines and screens, saying, like, I'm not going to solve these puzzles for you, like, it's all there."
2241.24,2245.0," If you just think about it, you'll get it. And now it's just like, fuck you, man, just give me the"
2245.0,2245.7999999999997, fucking answers.
2248.8399999999997,2253.96, They get crossword puzzle or something. You're taking a flight solve up myself. That's not why I came here.
2254.3599999999997,2257.0," Came here for the answers, because I couldn't solve it myself."
2257.0,2264.04," Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I think you can come off kind of a little snooty and interviews"
2264.04,2267.88," and stuff. But I guess I'd rather have my game designers come off as, like, pretentious artists"
2267.88,2272.68," than like car salesmen. Yeah, well, you know, like, we listen to what all the fans said."
2272.68,2278.2," Yeah. And we made a game that's exactly what he wanted. Yes, no, he's not bottom-feeting that's"
2278.2,2282.68," so. And that's yeah. And it is really interesting. I think it looks cool, too. Yeah."
2283.72,2289.72," They get's fantastic, too, that it's that it's out there. And that it is inspiring the sorts of"
2289.72,2293.56," discussions that we're having now and the kinds that you're seeing all over the internet. I mean,"
2293.64,2299.08," it's great for that to be there in a game. I mean, and it's been happening. I mean, just in the past few"
2299.08,2302.36," years, it's crazy. I mean, we're starting to see all this stuff from me. Yeah. I mean, it would have been"
2302.36,2308.36," a possible before. I mean, or watch games for TV like on YouTube. Did you see that? That's it."
2309.16,2313.4," And that was just amazing. I was looking at that. I was like, a kid. I used to like rush home from"
2313.4,2319.56," from school, so I could catch it as serious. Yeah. That's pretty fucking sad. There was another one."
2319.56,2327.24," And see what was a video. Video power. That was another TV show. And it had, you know, a sort of cool guy"
2327.7999999999997,2332.68, host that would talk about games. And then they had cartoons that were based on like Konami franchise.
2332.68,2337.4," It was big foot. Yeah. And the tomato do tomato. Yeah, like quick."
2337.96,2342.44, Yeah. I don't know. I played a fucking lot of Konami games. I don't remember no big foot. But I
2342.44,2347.24, get so mad because I wouldn't. I wasn't. I was like a cranch or something big foot and tomato.
2347.3199999999997,2351.0, I'd get detention for not doing my homework and then I wouldn't make it home in time for the video game.
2351.0,2355.7999999999997," Yeah. Yeah. Seeing that. Seeing even the games, though. I mean, it showed me how far things have"
2355.7999999999997,2359.72," come on that side. But of course, on the other level, watching that show, my things haven't come"
2359.72,2364.4399999999996," anywhere because it really reminds me of like, if you just changed the terminology to reflect the"
2364.4399999999996,2368.52, decade that the show was produced and it's really not all that different. A lot of the TV like
2368.52,2372.7599999999998," coverage of games nowadays, you know. I mean, it really is like, yeah. This is a, they have the review,"
2372.7599999999998,2376.2," you know, they have the review thing. And everything is getting to five, you know, perfect five,"
2376.2,2382.12," dude. And like the guys, that's the whole thing is that it's all fun filled. Every single one is like,"
2382.12,2389.48, that's totally like it's the rocket ship to the to space of video game in your face action.
2389.48,2394.68," Like go, oh, kind of like ridiculous. Like it like Mando and I mean, that kind of crap. I mean,"
2394.68,2398.4399999999996," when you see the game, remember from that era, the same era of like it was all like battle"
2398.4399999999996,2402.6," toes and you know, all those like extreme in your face mask. But I don't remember,"
2403.48,2407.96," I mean, I'm sure we said stupid shit back then. Yeah. But like, I don't remember. I mean,"
2407.96,2412.92," the way that they are, the hosts, it's basically you think, okay, these guys are just like the"
2412.92,2416.36, games that they're being in like that. The games are like this because everyone's walking around
2416.36,2420.44," talking like this. You're like, you know, the bog myster, the bog, the bog dude, it's got the most"
2420.44,2426.8399999999997," of the pain is troubled. It was really, I mean, it's really like that. If you, if you see it, you know,"
2426.8399999999997,2432.2799999999997," yeah. So it was like, if you just changed, that was what I inspired to. I might not have"
2432.36,2437.96," actually talked like that, but I bet I tried to what about I definitely aspire to like a"
2437.96,2443.6400000000003," bill and Ted excellence. You're like practice it. Yeah. No, not practice, but I would definitely"
2443.6400000000003,2450.44," definitely use it more than my Texas colleagues. Yeah. Yes. But I don't know. I, it's true that"
2450.44,2454.6800000000003, these kinds of games would never have happened before. And it's all this all this downloading stuff
2454.6800000000003,2459.6400000000003," is what it's all about. I think like particularly cool that it happens on a platform like,"
2459.64,2465.64," you know, on a console platform like Xbox users through XBLA have access to this stuff because"
2465.64,2471.0," this would normally be the kind of stuff that would just, you know, only be around for like"
2471.0,2477.3199999999997," total nerds on the PC that in this, you know, specific form or more another. And the fact that"
2477.3199999999997,2483.48," it isn't such a populist area where there's a ton of kids, I think is a really neat way for some"
2483.48,2487.48, of the stuff to get out. Yeah. I'm not going to throw it all though on like downloadables and stuff.
2487.48,2492.92," I mean, I honestly think that like bio-shock and, you know, portal and many other games are"
2492.92,2498.28," every little bit downloadable game. I mean, not for console people that wasn't. Yeah, but I mean,"
2498.28,2505.48," like, yeah, let's just do a little more special pleading. Yeah, let's just fuck stop fighting here."
2505.48,2511.08," I mean, I honestly think it's because it has a great deal to do with the fact that games that"
2511.08,2516.68, could never have sold for $60 like a best buy because they would have ended up like in stock
2516.68,2521.8799999999997," for three weeks sold a couple of copies and, you know, discounted, taken off the shelf forever."
2521.8799999999997,2527.64," Can hang out for a while, develop a long tail, have, you know, they don't always have to be like"
2527.64,2533.3199999999997," hits off the bat and people can invest in these things and, you know, sell them for $10 or $15."
2533.3199999999997,2540.7599999999998, Although apparently $15 is too much. I can't fucking believe like every time I read a thread about
2540.84,2545.88," braid, people are still fighting about this shit. About the $15. The $15. But that was like when portal came out,"
2545.88,2551.48," it was its length was the version of the braid price argument. Yeah. And it was in the price, too."
2551.48,2557.6400000000003," It was like the price to length, the price to length, the fucking ratio. I think after you pay $50 for space"
2557.6400000000003,2564.1200000000003," seed, you'll stop complaining about $15 for braid. Yeah. I'm just saying. I totally think,"
2564.1200000000003,2567.8," I mean, I absolutely understand what you're saying. I think that like the downloadable aspect is"
2567.8,2571.96," producing a whole lot. Like a game like braid in particular wouldn't exist. But I'm saying,"
2571.96,2578.52, I don't think that we owe this trend in creators of games trying to do something more than just
2578.52,2582.92," make a game where you punch someone in the head 50 times to get to the boss and get to them, you know,"
2582.92,2587.5600000000004, and repeat. Like I don't think we owe that to the downloadable stuff. I think that's what we have.
2587.5600000000004,2591.88," Yeah. I mean, there's definitely a lot of game developers have been pushing what a traditional"
2592.6,2598.92," $50, $60 game is. But now with all this stuff, people are going to, you know, start exploring"
2598.92,2603.88," all these weird territories that were never there before, you know, five hour game, the two hour game."
2603.88,2611.2400000000002," I want to play a 30 minute game. Like I love short, short games. I love like this whole thing"
2611.2400000000002,2616.6800000000003," with the Xbox Live summer stuff right now. Like every, every release that's coming out. I'm"
2616.6800000000003,2620.28," like interested in playing and it's like, you know, every week I've got something to download and"
2620.28,2624.84, mess around with for a few days and then leave it behind. Like I don't want to play like a game that's
2624.84,2629.96, going to take them all my time for weeks and weeks. I want to play something I can enjoy and put down.
2629.96,2636.52, So Graham was made for you. Yeah. Although I've not played it. It's eight the passage for five minutes.
2637.32,2643.0," No, okay. Yeah. I'm down with that. Yeah. I mean, that's what I love about a lot of like PC"
2643.0,2648.2000000000003," download stuff. Then you get for free as you play with it for a couple hours. Did the thing,"
2648.6,2651.72," you know, the other thing that's cool about like all these games, like you're saying is like the um,"
2652.8399999999997,2656.52," like I don't know, like when you reach the end of the generate of like, you know, the super Nintendo"
2656.52,2660.2," and the Genesis and Turbo graphics and then you moved over to 3D games. So like, okay, people,"
2660.8399999999997,2664.2," games of come out like Yoshi's Island and stuff and you're like, okay, that was it. The people"
2664.2,2669.08," have exhausted everything that can be done with the 2D games. And now it's kind of like,"
2669.08,2672.6," it just reminds me of like this alternate timeline where instead of like if those,"
2673.08,2676.8399999999997," immediately everything switched over to 3D, like what if like the next generation after"
2676.92,2681.1600000000003," Super Nintendo was another 2D machine or something, you know, um, probably someone screaming"
2681.1600000000003,2687.32," Saturn or whatever, but like you success, you know, and then people continue to deal with it and"
2687.32,2690.92," stuff. I mean, that's, I mean, because that's really what like Brade is, right? I mean, imagine,"
2690.92,2694.1200000000003," like you wouldn't it would have been in conceivable by back then. But I mean, imagine if you had played"
2694.1200000000003,2698.84," Brade and like whatever, you know, like 19, but you should have played Brade is 3D. The third"
2698.84,2708.84," dimension is time. And even. But I mean, like that, that would have like, I mean, that would have"
2708.84,2713.7200000000003," just been like mind building back then. Oh, yeah. And nobody would have bought it and it would be,"
2713.7200000000003,2717.88," I bet they would have do it. If you had a game of platformer game, even everything else aside,"
2717.88,2724.2000000000003," if you had a platformer with fucking the building to rewind for like, you know, whole minutes and"
2724.2000000000003,2728.2000000000003," stuff. Yeah. And like all that's, I think that would have freaked us out. Do we got excited?"
2728.2799999999997,2732.7599999999998," It like, remember something like the mode 7 shit in the worst case scenarios? Like in Castlevania"
2732.7599999999998,2737.16, for where like the background spinning. And now it looks like a bunch of like fucked up like artifact
2737.16,2741.96," JPEGs just like getting like manipulated all around and Photoshop to make you want to like,"
2741.96,2747.16," puked but back then that was that was like, whoa. Yeah. I think that's what the game"
2747.24,2757.64," Pro TV guys said. Right in the mood seven wave. Yeah. I don't know. So you want to, you"
2757.64,2763.8799999999997, want to come off the serious talk and get into the story of um sexual expression and age of
2763.8799999999997,2769.7999999999997," Conan. Oh my god, this will be like the biggest 180 ever. Yes, do it. Good immediately. All right."
2770.3599999999997,2775.64," Well, uh, before we came to the top of the two, right, you did this. A story, uh, see, one of our"
2775.64,2780.12, readers posted it on our on our board and I don't know where the original source was but apparently
2782.52,2789.64," yeah, an age of Conan, GM was uh, was busted and apparently there's so the story goes with"
2789.64,2798.8399999999997," fired because he was caught a cyberring with a uh, with a player of the game and the transcript of"
2798.8399999999997,2804.12, of the of set interaction has also made it onto the internet. And we just happen to have a copy of
2804.44,2809.96," that. And I think we're going to do traumatic reading it. Okay. No, yeah. No idea how this is going to go"
2809.96,2814.2, because I don't even read. I will be practicing it. We are going to this is going to be a little dramatic
2814.2,2820.3599999999997, theater. Yeah. So who's going to be the GM though and who's going to be? I don't know what what you
2820.3599999999997,2827.64, feel more like. What's your motivation? Who is whose mount? Yeah. I could be the GM. You're going to be
2827.64,2832.44," the GM. Okay. So I'm the guy, I guess they believed his name out. He was just empty brackets. We"
2832.52,2838.76, get to make up here. Name protecting the children. Okay. So I don't even know for male or female.
2838.76,2843.64," I think actually that's part of what happens here. Oh, that's the deal. Yeah. This is going to be like"
2843.64,2846.92," uh, yeah. You can do text voice like extroverts. Do a text role version theater."
2850.6,2855.08," Well, it looks like it starts in in in the middle of the action here, right? Doesn't it?"
2856.28,2860.76," Because he starts off with with dual-wheeled barbarians though. I mean, two,"
2861.7200000000003,2866.92," that's a bit difficult for me to handle. I'd rather stick with one big sword. You like it,"
2866.92,2874.1200000000003," real fine, take it. Of course. Of course. I'm a fucking rock sniffer."
2877.48,2883.4," And it's what? I don't know what does that mean. Jeff, you're supposed to play the part. Okay. Don't"
2883.4,2888.0400000000004, critique the script. I'm just looking to paint you to fucking act. I'm looking for my motivations.
2888.12,2892.2799999999997, Okay. I'm a fucking rock sniffer.
2894.68,2898.7599999999998," Keep going. Oh, it's my line next to the Oslo. Wait for your line. No."
2898.7599999999998,2904.36, With daggers. There's going to be some gift. And I'm just back for second wind. I can go all night.
2905.08,2910.7599999999998," Well, wow. I don't think I would ever be the same. Wow. This is turning me on, little."
2911.4,2921.32," Hong says, who's Hong? I'm all confused by this. Just keep going. Hong says he wants in on the"
2921.32,2928.36," hot action. But he's a gold farmer slash seller. How do you feel about that? He does have a big bow,"
2928.36,2940.36, a bow. Do it like they do on the Discovery Channel? Would you like to RP with me?
2941.2400000000002,2946.84, I see how it is not going to talk anymore. Sad face. Just got your cyber fix with my
2946.84,2952.76," pixelated body and left me like all those other guys double sad face. Sorry, getting tells"
2952.76,2961.0," Hills law RP. How so? Well, you know, on those cold windy nights, I want it to be mounted."
2961.5600000000004,2969.88," Well, low I see you're trying to get laid by a GM. Of course. I thought you were the master"
2969.96,2979.6400000000003," gamer master. Be gentle. Are you a real woman? Law, not crazy question. You would be surprised."
2980.44,2985.88, Yep. I just play a male character. So guys don't flirt with me in games like on wow.
2985.88,2990.44," Oh, nice. How about you? I'm wearing panties."
2991.4,2996.68, I'm expecting a turn of events.
2999.2400000000002,3002.76," Just go to the turn your screen. Oh, that's you. You'll know it is time to turn the page."
3002.76,3006.92," No, you lost your list. Oh, I did that deliberately. Okay."
3008.44,3013.32," You have a trust me. Okay, let's back it up. The next line was in brackets joke. But I think"
3013.32,3018.2000000000003, it detracts from the comedy to reveal that he wasn't actually wearing panties. Our listeners would
3018.2799999999997,3023.8799999999997, have a better time if they really visualized this guy wearing panties. It was delivered.
3023.8799999999997,3028.12, Okay. All right. Okay. You know what kind of panties? That we're going to get to that if you
3028.12,3034.9199999999996," are here. Okay. Oh, not wearing any. I did see you take them off earlier after all."
3035.56,3040.7599999999998, I'm going to summon you and if you to take care of your petition. Exhibitionist.
3040.84,3050.1200000000003, Summoning me. How romantic. Where's my summon? Low. You really do love me.
3050.1200000000003,3058.2000000000003," This is the spot. Low. This is like pretty hot. You like this. Or had. Yeah, whoa."
3060.36,3063.8, I left the boots on. They're hot. Or low.
3064.6800000000003,3071.5600000000004," Oh, but he must be spanking at this point. Yeah, because the white hand is very,"
3072.1200000000003,3076.44, a lot less typing going on. Yeah. My panties won't come off. Sad face.
3077.32,3087.0800000000004," Well, it's all looking at a guy character. Low in RL. Huh? No in game. Your panties won't come off"
3087.24,3094.04," in real life. Oh, I'll just have to tear them off and have my way all. Yes."
3094.7599999999998,3102.2," Without your massive soy, too. Raffle. Lawl, you like it. I can't jump on top of it."
3102.7599999999998,3110.2799999999997, Sad face. That could pose a problem. You'll just have to take it until I'm finished with you.
3110.52,3118.1200000000003, Are you a mighty warrior? Can you slay those meanies that attacked me? Sad face?
3119.0800000000004,3128.76," Oh, you do like multiple people in on it, huh? How old are you? Hopefully not under 18, Lawl."
3130.92,3134.52, I'm nine. Oh my god.
3135.08,3143.88," Want to be my daddy? Remember, I do like role playing. Oh, that's nice. You're only not nine,"
3143.88,3149.64," are you? I just want to be sure, Lawl. Come on. Do I sound like I'm nine? What nine"
3149.64,3156.68, you rolled notes about glory holes? Did this is totally sounding like the Ticketchip predator thing?
3156.68,3164.44," Oh, you don't, but you never know, Lawl. You've been a bad girl. I've never been a good girl."
3164.44,3171.48," No, very nice, but you know you'll have to be sprained, right? Take me out and put me in your mouth."
3174.04,3179.72," That's a good point. Not till you spank me with your soy. From your Brad,"
3179.72,3185.08, want to fire rip off your panties and you hard until I am satisfied.
3188.52,3196.52, That sounds perfect. Going to use clobber. Want to feel you get really weak so I can just put the
3196.52,3204.04," head of my inside new and use my hand as slowly moving around before plunging into you,"
3204.04,3212.84," following and making you take it all. Oh, climax. I think we should stop long ago."
3212.84,3218.68," Yeah, we're getting into Ziff, Lawl's new territory here. You guys, oh no, okay. We have to continue"
3218.68,3224.68," to continue. Yeah, here's the resolution. Yeah, we're up to the final. You're just as kinky as me. In fact,"
3224.7599999999998,3231.0, you're so kinky. You just cybert with a dude smiley face. This is sparta.
3234.6,3238.8399999999997, There's something wrong with the chronology here because my next line is then when you're really
3238.8399999999997,3244.8399999999997," hot and eating more, I can reposition. I see he was still going. The other guy was already saying. Yeah."
3244.8399999999997,3250.7599999999998," Guess what? Oh, this guy was still he was still outworked up. So he was saying what he was going to"
3250.92,3255.4," do. I don't even want to read the next one. Yeah, we're a pornographic. Yeah, it gets very pornographic."
3257.1600000000003,3261.7200000000003, I'm real. So then so then you can see that he's writing that as I'm going. You just
3261.7200000000003,3267.8," saber with the dude. This is sparta. He types off. Okay. Oh, yeah, then then he's. Okay. That would"
3267.8,3277.0," really not be good, Lawl. Love you. It's my way face. By the way, by the way, I've been"
3277.08,3284.92," fapping to this the whole time. Why did you want this then, Lawl? Are you gay? Are you serious?"
3287.08,3294.52," Seriously, about what? Um, what's fapping? I'm not up to par on the lingo, Lawl. I was joking about"
3294.52,3302.68," the fapping, but I am indeed a dude. Okay, I'm glad I put my clothes back on Lawl. Yeah, probably a good"
3302.68,3311.72," idea. I have AIDS. Oh, yeah. Sorry that that was rocking. Oh, man. Yeah, we didn't really have to do"
3311.72,3317.16," that, did we? I'm a good. I feel fucking dirty. I feel it dirty. See, that's like an interaction between"
3317.16,3321.48, form and content like that was a script written so that we feel the shame of the protagonist as we
3321.48,3329.8799999999997," read it. I definitely feel the shame. It's like an... Are you looking for a towel? I need to, actually,"
3329.88,3337.32," I'm trying to hide my fucking heart on. I need to go the bathroom. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh,"
3337.32,3342.28, so let us be a lesson to you. What can we take away from this all experience here?
3342.28,3347.6400000000003," Uh, when they have dramatic readings of Cybring on this podcast ever again, that's one thing"
3347.6400000000003,3352.2000000000003, to take away. And also the practical lesson for anyone and the age of Conan is that
3353.08,3360.04," if you're Cybring with a character who is a dude, chances are he actually isn't."
3361.08,3367.48," If you're Cybring with a dude, if you're Cybring with a chick he's probably dude. Right. Why?"
3367.48,3371.08," I just can't imagine how you talk someone, especially in a game like age of Conan,"
3371.08,3376.4399999999996, where it's all like buff dudes and like girls with giant breasts. Like couldn't you find at least a guy
3376.52,3382.2000000000003," who was willing to play a girl? Right. Also, he probably won't. Yeah, on his monitor,"
3382.2000000000003,3388.2000000000003," he's staring at the text and then above it, there's like a naked dude. But the text even,"
3388.2000000000003,3392.28," like the person that was the role that you played Jeff, wasn't even really saying anything. Like"
3392.28,3397.2400000000002," I imagine getting off to that. It was like almost entirely like, and furthermore, he was at work."
3397.8,3401.08," I mean, this was his job was to be in the game monitoring the game."
3401.4,3409.16," Oh, man. So, well, yeah. It's a sad idea. I've never lost a job doing something that's stupid."
3410.44,3416.36," That's true. He just wanted some place to write. He got tired of penthouse letters, not publishing"
3416.36,3421.24," a submission, so he just needed some place where he can let the world, you know, what kind of a"
3421.24,3430.2," real man's series? I feel bad now. Well, if I could take it back to to a series land,"
3430.7599999999998,3436.2799999999997, I got we have one of their MMO week talk about very briefly the Star Trek one. That's here all about it.
3436.2799999999997,3441.7999999999997," You've got and then you've, why just wanted to tell the tale of, um, because they announced it."
3442.9199999999996,3449.0," This weekend, cryptic cryptic studios, guys, are making champions online, and now said, and I,"
3449.7999999999997,3455.48," I lied blogged it. I heard some people in the Star Trek on my forums weren't. Yeah, there's a pretty,"
3455.56,3462.6," pretty long, hate thread about Jeff Green on there. Because I, you know,"
3465.0,3470.2," guys asked me to lie blogging and I did, and it was very, very blow-hanging fruit, fish, and you"
3470.2,3475.16," know, a shooting fish in a barrel thing. And my blogging a Star Trek webcast, you know,"
3476.6,3480.76," and I really like the cryptic guys a lot. I'm not a Star Trek fan. I don't know,"
3480.76,3485.88," anything against Star Trek. I'm just not a fan. So, you know, I was trying to, I am taking a game"
3485.88,3491.7200000000003," seriously, and I especially from an MMO standpoint as an MMO player, but watching this webcast,"
3491.7200000000003,3495.7200000000003," I was clearly just kind of looking just for, you know, dumb ass jokes to tell. I mean,"
3495.7200000000003,3499.5600000000004," shit. Well, the whole notion is a home on Sunday, and that you were live blogging webbid."
3499.5600000000004,3503.8," Yeah, webcast. Right. I mean, that whole sort of that it was a joke. Right. It was a joke."
3503.8,3509.4," And so everything I said was just completely, you know, it was just court gesture bullshit, you know,"
3509.48,3515.08, picking on Star Trek fans is like picking on Scientologists. Do not want to do that. And they
3515.08,3520.28," will haunt you for years. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. I'm waiting for the death threats to show up."
3520.28,3525.2400000000002," And, you know, at one point, you know, there's a guy, you know, I'm watching the webcast, and they're,"
3525.2400000000002,3529.2400000000002, they get to the question and answer part. And you just know that this stuff's going to be comedy
3529.2400000000002,3533.08," gold with these guys there. And one, and they're, but they're actually pretty boring, actually."
3533.08,3537.96," There wasn't a whole lot of comedy fodder, but then one guy gets up there, you know, complete,"
3538.12,3542.68," nerdy looking guy and he gets up there and he says, hey, this is Christopher from Earth."
3542.68,3546.76," Because everybody else has been, you know, Joe from Albuquerque or whatever. So that was his,"
3546.76,3551.56, hit that was his ha-ha line. But then he goes on then his question is not a question. He starts going
3551.56,3559.16," off about how, um, yeah, you know, I just want to know if there's going to be strategy in this game,"
3559.16,3564.52," like if I have knowledge of, of of of, you know, military tactics and things like death,"
3564.6,3569.08," I'm not just going to get owned by little kids, you know, because those of us who who watch"
3569.08,3574.92," Star Trek, we tend to be like physicists and scientists and this goes on and on about how smart he and,"
3574.92,3581.32," and we as Star Trek fans are and therefore this game better live up to, to our thing, you know, and so,"
3581.96,3588.12," so, you know, I just sort of mock that a little bit. And then Jack Emerd, the producer,"
3588.12,3592.68, did what he did with all all the questions that he took in various series saying was respectful and it was great.
3593.3199999999997,3598.68," Jack Emerd says his piece and so he's done with the guy and then the guy, the, the camera,"
3598.68,3602.2799999999997," the webcast goes back on this guy and he's still standing there and he says,"
3603.08,3613.08," Star Trek is in your hands. Oh man, it's kind of ominous, you know, wow. So then I wrote that in the"
3613.08,3617.48," live blog. I was like, man, if I was cryptic, I'd be watching Netflix or I, you know, it's like,"
3617.48,3623.32," it's kind of like a Star Trek in your hands. Yeah, so, you know, that's just like the nature of what this thing was."
3623.32,3628.44," And so, turn off on this official Star Trek forms. There's like a three-page thread. Oh, but that's"
3628.44,3635.2400000000002," a part I left out when he said, when he said, um, this is John from Earth or whatever, I wrote,"
3635.2400000000002,3641.32," I wrote that. I said, oh, this guy just called himself John from Earth, way to go nerd. That's what I typed."
3641.32,3647.08," Okay, so that's one of the things people took a fence to and went on about in their pulse. Like,"
3647.16,3652.7599999999998," who does this guy think he is at a gaming form calling us nerds? Like, what does he think he is?"
3652.7599999999998,3657.3199999999997," Well, this is like, would like Star Trek fans to try out if they're being made fun of, but it's like,"
3657.3199999999997,3661.88, I was awesome in nerd. What do you think I'm watching it? What do you think I'm doing here?
3661.88,3666.52," I just haven't heard. They should know that there's, there's a hierarchy. Like, I mean, certainly,"
3666.52,3674.68," certainly, I video game fans are nerds, but not nearly as much as a Star Trek fan would be."
3675.16,3683.56," See, video game nerds they get married, right? They have lives and Star Trek fans are married to the"
3683.56,3689.72," enterprise. And I have people in my family and friends. Yeah. Mayor,"
3689.72,3695.48, to the Star Trek fans. I have friends who have constructed their own uniforms and fazards. Okay.
3695.48,3700.6," I know, I know these people. There were people who they said the size dial with him yet? No,"
3700.6,3708.2799999999997, but they've tried. I grew up on Star Trek because my mom is a mega mega mega star Trek fan.
3708.2799999999997,3713.64, And I got to say I fucking hate it. Is she can turn herself a trickier or a tricker? She's a tricker.
3714.92,3720.2799999999997," That's what we watched most growing up, although I did have to suffer through all the 60s shit to"
3724.68,3728.7599999999998," Okay, so this is partially the sum of your own, you know, like, mother issues that you're working at."
3728.76,3733.8," Yeah, definitely. This isn't just you. And just being like, we're talking about Star Trek on here."
3733.8,3739.1600000000003, Like it seems to come up a lot. It's coming up. I brought it up a few times. I think it's cool.
3739.1600000000003,3742.92, Like I'm not. You like start. Like I respect Trek. He's every second one on the
3742.92,3746.5200000000004," deck. You've entered in a watch. Like Star Trek, the next generation stuff. Like it's cool."
3746.5200000000004,3751.32," I've got nothing against Star Trek. This is the problem. I don't. Online,"
3751.32,3755.88," in any whatever the format is, you can expect. I don't know. I don't know."
3755.88,3758.84," To have read this to have, like of course, listen to our podcast. Right."
3758.84,3763.4," Know that you constantly make fun of yourself for being a nerd. Right. And I mean, I get myself"
3763.4,3767.88, going to trouble all the time on the show. I'll post something on a forum or something. And it's just totally
3767.88,3771.4," misinterpreted. Right. And I always look. I'm like, either I'm just a shitty communicator."
3771.4,3775.48," It might be that, but there's also like I'm fucking up because I'm assuming that people are aware"
3775.48,3779.48, of all of my positions and that's right. Right. Because I've expressed the mouseware and like you can.
3779.48,3783.48," So yeah, these people get it and they get it as part of the nerd, Posse where, you know,"
3783.48,3787.4, you look around for something to be outraged about online every day. Sure. And so it makes its way
3787.4,3792.6, back to them. And then that's the thing. Look what he said about us. Yeah. And so then there's the
3792.6,3796.76, fucking outraged. Right. Like then they all go on and you're going to start doing that. They're probably
3796.76,3800.52," forgot all about it. But even though I was doing the live blog, I was thinking, oh yeah,"
3800.52,3804.6," that there's going to be some nerd rage over this. And there was. And when I saw the threat,"
3804.6,3809.4, I was laughing as I read it. The only part that bummed me out was that eventually the threat gets locked.
3809.48,3813.8," And the the the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the log in, cop to it. Did you try to make an account?"
3813.8,3820.04," Did not. Did, did you consider it? Yes, I did. But I didn't, but I didn't. Yeah. I was locked."
3820.04,3824.44, I put and you linked me to the thread. Yeah. I went to go to making a count because I was going to
3824.44,3829.64, put this like really fucked up story about how like I was totally offended and like I were going to
3829.64,3833.4," some people could call me in the nerd and I was going to say like, you know, whatever. I'm I'm"
3833.4,3838.52," so and so many pounds and I'm really disappointed because I got a flesh light, but I can only I can't even"
3838.52,3845.0," get far enough into it to hit to the Ruby. But I'm not a nerd and I am a nerd, but I don't need"
3845.0,3848.52," this guy telling me I'm a nerd and I'm making that part of it. Now, I was going to close up with"
3848.52,3853.48," something sad. Not a sad as that. But assuming that I was a bond to it, you were going to grief me."
3853.48,3857.64," Well, not for you, just for everyone else. He like, yeah, man, like this is why you don't go around"
3857.64,3861.48," saying this kind of shit. Like look at like quirky here, whatever. I call myself, you know."
3862.44,3865.32, You're not fucking thankful for you start live blogging with a kiss.
3867.16,3872.68," Yeah, so I, so the, when the last match of just from a GM is says like, you know, this, you know,"
3872.68,3876.28," he was entitled to his opinion, meaning me, whatever, but we're locking this right because, you know,"
3876.28,3880.12, this isn't the place for negative comments about our game or whatever. It was a long
3880.12,3890.7599999999998," dose line. It's like really, you know, like, I don't know. I didn't feel like that I would have"
3890.7599999999998,3894.8399999999997," been happy with them leaving it open and bashing me more. You have to know, though, I've seen"
3894.8399999999997,3899.7999999999997, you get genuinely pissed off when people opposed to things on our forums like the infamous way walker.
3899.7999999999997,3903.08," And you've been like, before we figured out it was way blast time, you're like, dude, I want to"
3903.08,3907.08," ban the scam. Like, you're right, and I'm like, why? Because he, I mean, like, maybe we disagree with"
3907.08,3910.7599999999998," him. He's an asshole, but I'm like, we just look like pussy's if we ban someone for like disagreeing."
3910.7599999999998,3915.7999999999997," Well, you're right, but it's different because that's our forums. Yeah. Here I felt like that was the"
3915.7999999999997,3919.64," official Star Trek game forum. Yeah, I didn't want to like go into their band. Do you know how much"
3919.64,3924.44," satisfaction he just gave that guy by saying his name on the podcast, the way walker. He always comes"
3924.44,3929.96," back when he did that most recent time. No, no, no, I don't care. He's kind of like, he's just a staple."
3929.96,3933.88," He's like a, like, a force to be like, you can, he's like, harpies, you know, you can do"
3933.96,3940.92," it. You're just fucking banning him, but you can't get rid of him. Yeah, not really a serious"
3940.92,3944.92," STD and. But yeah, like, when I first start seeing those posts, remember, and you know,"
3944.92,3948.76," like, something's up with this dude. Yeah, I did. I did an eye contact to see, and I tried to"
3948.76,3954.04," match him to the way walker count, and it didn't match. So I was like, but then other people,"
3954.04,3957.6400000000003," like, persisted with it, and clearly he just had like a dynamic. I mean, he was very cleverly"
3957.6400000000003,3961.96," getting my goat in that particular threat. Yeah, he's totally getting you. Yeah. He was way"
3962.04,3966.04," barking all over. Yeah, he was. And the start wasn't annoyed in the start correcting."
3966.04,3972.44," I really wasn't in that thread. I mean, I wasn't like upset. Yeah, you know, you could have,"
3972.44,3975.48," it would have been cool. Like, I don't know if you could have just read certain"
3975.48,3979.8," but I'm like, like, hey, guys, like, I have all just because you have no context, but like trust me,"
3979.8,3985.0," like, I play, take it to ride, and tonight I'm going to go home to do this, and I do a podcast about"
3985.0,3988.84," my World of Workout character. Right. I mean, this is essentially what I was going to be honest."
3988.84,3992.6000000000004," I'm going to start to actually probably a lot cooler than that. So, well, right. Is that's"
3992.6000000000004,3996.84," essentially what I was going to do. It was like, I'm actually, I was just having fun, you know,"
3996.84,4001.8," I'm wanting you guys. This was just a goof, you know. So I guess that's a long window way."
4001.8,4008.44, And how could you possibly entertainingly live blog a Star Trek MMO announcement without
4008.44,4012.84," at least making some nerd jokes? Well, I mean, if you're just going to play it straight,"
4012.84,4016.1200000000003," you know, and also if you learn read the thing, there's plenty of time to where I was like"
4016.12,4021.48," saying the sounds cool. I mean, they were cherry picking the hate. And furthermore, you know,"
4021.48,4027.0," they were kind of like nerd, were Star Trek, key comments made throughout the thing, you know,"
4027.0,4031.4," even Leonard Nimoy was sort of poking fun at the whole thing at the beginning. I mean, if you can't,"
4031.4,4034.8399999999997," if you can't participate in something like this without a sense of humor, you know, geez."
4036.8399999999997,4041.0," You got some problems. I mean, if this is if you're an adult, and you think that this, and"
4041.0,4044.68," and it's cool to have these hobbies, we all think that's what I'm doing here today."
4044.8399999999997,4048.9199999999996," Did they show much about the game itself? Or just announced? Well, they talked about a Jack"
4048.9199999999996,4054.12," and we're talked about it a lot. And they had a brief trailer, but the trailer didn't show a whole"
4054.12,4059.56," lot, but he went on in detail just verbally about concepts in the game. What's happened pretty good?"
4059.96,4064.6," So, this is a kid's, I mean, like how do you grind in Star Trek without bringing the"
4064.6,4068.52, killer. You got to kill the truth. Who painted your kid comic of the day? You got to go out and
4068.52,4074.92," collect 30 troubles. And then that's probably going to be it, right? Well, I don't know. They talked"
4074.92,4080.84," about, you know, there's going to be a planetary exploration. There's going to be ship ship combat."
4080.84,4085.4," They're, um, so, you know, is there going to be alien on alien sex?"
4087.8,4098.2," Only between the GMs and other, and other do. So anyway, the announcement itself was,"
4098.28,4102.679999999999," it is kind of amazing that this thing is still alive because this has been one of those, uh,"
4102.679999999999,4107.8," and they'll see like, barged projects. So, um, you know, originally this was in the hands of,"
4107.8,4115.8," of perpetual, uh, the nap-de-funked perpetual. He not so perpetual, uh, or at a business, and the"
4115.8,4122.679999999999," license was picked up by, by cryptic here. So, um, but, but perpetual had it for a while. So,"
4122.679999999999,4126.92," my here's my question about, and in your, maybe a little closer to Star Trek than I am."
4128.36,4133.24," Yeah, Robert's mom played it because Robert's mom played it. Is it like, it's just,"
4133.24,4138.12," I can't wonder about it. What do you play the game? That alone, she plays a Zoom, or whatever."
4138.84,4146.44," So far. But is this, is a franchise still as alive and well as, as never? I don't, I don't know. I mean,"
4146.44,4151.16," I think, I think, is the new movie going to wrap up. I think that again. I think the fan base is,"
4151.16,4157.88," is like, is sort of self-properuating, and it doesn't need any, like, cultural popularity in the"
4157.88,4163.32, present for it to sort of continue. You know? Yeah. I don't think that it's anywhere near at the
4163.32,4168.92," level that it was when, you know, you had, like, a next generation and, and Voyager and all,"
4168.92,4173.16," all these, like, various off-sheets popping up before they ground into the ground. Look how long it"
4173.16,4177.56," was between the original series and next generation. Yeah. I mean, what they had movies and stuff."
4177.56,4181.64," It just strikes me as, like, less of a mainstream product than maybe they're thinking it is."
4181.64,4186.36," Like, I don't know. But the people that they could get are exactly the kind who will be willing"
4186.36,4192.599999999999," to pay a monthly fee. Sure. And over and over again. Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't, I don't think"
4192.599999999999,4198.36," Star Trek is a mainstream thing. But I don't know what is, like, American Idol. I don't know."
4199.4,4203.96," It's a niche thing with, like, a lot of fans, which is basically all anybody wants anymore."
4204.679999999999,4208.759999999999," I guess so. Yeah. I mean, that was a period when they were grinding out the movie,"
4208.759999999999,4213.4," so that with the original cast where it was, I think a lot more in the public eye. Right."
4213.799999999999,4219.96," Although I don't know if like the next generation movies were nearly as big. Consider worldwide, too."
4220.679999999999,4226.839999999999, There's like a world wide Star Trek fan base trackers. Right. And you're going to play Star Trek online.
4227.96,4235.48," Am I try it? I'm not a Star Trek fan at all. But I'm, I'm interested in seeing, if they make a good"
4235.48,4240.599999999999, sci-fi in the most. Certainly they've got to be trackies or trackers at one up. They've got to be.
4240.68,4245.8," I mean, just odds are. There have to be, maybe even Chuck, because Anthony was upset about the whole,"
4245.8,4250.4400000000005," like, y'all, like, date and stuff. Oh, was he really mad at us? Because it wasn't more. He's like,"
4250.4400000000005,4257.0," there's no evidence for that. He was seriously like, disappointed in us. Well,"
4257.0,4261.96," he really, I was out last night here today because he said he's like, Star Trek people and"
4261.96,4265.64, Star Wars people don't get along because Star Trek people think Star Wars people are idiots.
4265.64,4269.64," There's no, there's a lot of overlap between the two. I think they've come to"
4269.64,4273.08," grips with it. I think they got to the brilliant where they're like, they had an honest. There's"
4273.08,4277.160000000001," only so much Star Wars and there's only so much Star Trek and like, what do we do when the"
4277.160000000001,4281.56," shit's not coming out? We go to the other. Like, we might as well love it all. So they probably had some big"
4281.56,4286.12, meeting and some big calls sort of like a west side story. They were either side of the camp and then one
4286.12,4291.400000000001," person took one step forward and eventually they hugged. One year, they had Star Wars people. One year,"
4291.400000000001,4296.68, they had dual interventions at the high at Regency. And there is this big showdown in the lobby.
4296.68,4301.72," They're going to fight tasers versus lightsaber. Yeah, but cosplayer like start hooking up with the"
4301.72,4307.320000000001," yodel constantly. But the Vulcan contingent came out and you know, and talks some reason into"
4307.320000000001,4314.360000000001, people and ever able to make them see that war has no logical basis for existing. And so they came
4314.360000000001,4321.240000000001, to a truce. I'm sorry that I continue to create this thing for the lower. We're all sitting here
4321.32,4327.96," sort of like, yeah, that sounds cool. We did. We'll probably have like a lot of Trek keys and"
4327.96,4332.92," Trekkers. Sorry. I keep saying it like that. That's from Trekies the movie. Yeah, they were"
4332.92,4337.96," seen the second. Trekies movie. It's not as good as the first horror. Yeah, it goes a sequel."
4337.96,4342.12," Yeah, don't even bother. Don't we get the thing about the sequel that you get to find out more about"
4342.12,4348.84," the one kid who's just like, in dubitably, the stitching needs to be released by 160 double"
4348.84,4352.52," each other. Otherwise, they pretty knock out job out, say like you find out that like I"
4352.52,4357.4800000000005," get to marry it and yeah, he kind of melded about him. Yeah, but there's the one woman who she"
4357.4800000000005,4362.28," she started off selling armor and it convention some sort of like Jen Conte, type scenario."
4362.28,4368.4400000000005, Originally we were selling armor and we got some trick cards and eventually we had more
4368.4400000000005,4374.2," trick cards that armor and next thing you know, a matrickey not a trick card or something like that."
4375.16,4382.5199999999995," That's a big that's a big transition for Trek fans. That's like from, you know,"
4382.5199999999995,4387.32," like coming from something punk to go, there's something like your friends will disown you."
4387.32,4391.8," So it's like a conscious thing you say, I'm no longer a trekkey, I'm a trekker. What's a different"
4391.8,4398.5199999999995," trekker? Trekkers are legit. They had, you know, it was so sad. The explanation that they had in"
4398.5199999999995,4402.599999999999," there was just like, I'm not a fan. Like they're trying to say that they're not fans, but that"
4402.68,4407.160000000001, they're almost like they they they I don't know man. It was just some half-asher. It was just like the same
4407.160000000001,4411.0, people that had the talk show and they're like we had to debate whether it was going to be called
4411.0,4415.160000000001," Trek Tucker, or Trek. No, ultimately we've decided it was going to be called Trek Duck because we were"
4415.160000000001,4420.04," talking about how we're not talking about Trek. I mean, I thought I had the difference between"
4420.04,4424.92, trekking and trekker was next generation in classic. I thought trekkers were next generation in
4424.92,4430.360000000001," trekkeys were old school. You need to part of the DVD son because there's no agreement. Yeah,"
4430.44,4435.24, there's some people that think that. There's like the old school ones called themselves trekkeys.
4435.24,4439.639999999999, Yeah. But then there are some that were there's a guy dressed up as Captain Kirk and he was calling
4439.639999999999,4445.799999999999, himself a trekker because do they like fight the two sides? Like it's there's no internal
4445.799999999999,4451.16," squabbling amongst these star trek fans about, you know, the trekkeys are cooler than the"
4451.16,4455.08, trekkers kind of thing. We were here first. So we don't know what the difference is. The
4455.16,4459.48," probably is just like the cash or the fight between casual and hard-earned, hard-earned, hard-earned,"
4459.48,4464.84, casual game or X-Bad Ryan is frustrated. Do you want to know what's the difference? I kind of want
4464.84,4473.24," another difference too. Yeah, what what? I gave my my theory. I don't know. Wikipedia. Oh no."
4474.04,4477.64, We're going to have something to post on the board there. It's also also different between
4477.64,4482.04, Trekking and Trekker. I wish that you could just call it a non-wikipedia. Is there a distinction
4482.04,4485.4, between like the people who just like watch the show and think it's cool and the people who
4485.4,4491.32," who don't, who dress like, like, get them on up here. We will read it. You guys want a quick review of"
4491.32,4495.56, a comic about this in because Anthony had read it as well when I thought we were going to review it
4495.56,4500.44, together. Can you start off by describing the quality of this man's death? Oh look Martin Miller wrote it.
4500.44,4508.28, It sucks. Wow. There's my review. I don't think we need to give any further than that. I think
4508.28,4514.04," Ryan totally owned that review. Yeah, it's he Sean's face. I actually not bought that. I do think it sucks."
4515.32,4521.0," Yeah, the comic is called War Heroes. It's an issue one of six coming out Mark Miller's guy"
4521.0,4526.92, wrote Ultimates. I was talking about before. He's done some good stuff. The artist on this Tony Harris
4526.92,4530.84, does this other does the illustrations for another series called X-Mark and now then I read.
4531.639999999999,4535.88," Generally pretty good. The artist has got a problem in it like every like thing he draws,"
4535.88,4540.6, the source materials a photograph of a person. Okay. So I'm just going to talk to you Jeff.
4540.6,4548.36," Well, Ryan and they're reading a laptop about trekking. I can't can we say go ahead."
4548.36,4552.28," Yeah, do that and then we'll get back to the Wikipedia entry for trekky versus trekking."
4552.28,4557.0, Excellent. Some start trekken thusiness per figure the term trekky. While some others
4557.0,4563.08," self identify as trekker, self identification as a trekky became even less popular after a famous"
4563.16,4569.16, national television parody in 1986. See parodies below. Several self described
4569.16,4575.08, trekkers were quoted as saying they had a life contrasting themselves from trekkeys. Okay.
4575.08,4580.84," So trekkers are trekkeys who don't wear their uniform to bed. They were, well, some of the"
4580.84,4587.08, self identifying trekkers were those that were wearing like the woman who wore her uniform.
4587.08,4591.08," Oh, where? Are my uniforms? She wore her start trekking a far off phase or two. The Clinton"
4591.08,4599.08," and in the documentary trekkeys, Kate Mulgrew stated that trekkers are the ones walking with us."
4599.08,4603.96," While the trekkeys are the ones content to simply sit and watch star trek. Oh, there we go. Yeah,"
4603.96,4607.8, that's what I was getting hung up on. It's walking with shit. Oh dear. Thank you.
4607.8,4612.36," There are those who trekkeys are just passive in a watching. Well, the trekkers will walk along"
4612.36,4618.36, beside us. Where? To the fucking convention. Walk with these actors. We're pretending to play
4618.36,4624.599999999999," these roles in this fictional universe. Yeah, and rely remember my first convention. Wow."
4624.599999999999,4629.639999999999," That's scary. Well, that's how it was really wish that Star Trek was a place that you could go and live."
4630.2,4635.32," You know, you can and Star Trek online soon enough. Yeah. Tell us. Tell us about our"
4635.32,4640.759999999999," Miller's latest name, but back to the comic book. Yes. Buck been riding."
4643.08,4647.4," So what's with this? Who mustache? There's a guy on the cover, appointed gun at me and he has"
4648.12,4654.04, a really ridiculous hand of bar mustache. Here's the deal with War Heroes. It's like a near future.
4654.04,4659.799999999999, Here's like the quick version of what's wrong with this book. Yeah. It's a near future take on basically
4659.799999999999,4664.599999999999," what what's happening with America and it's war on terror. But imagine though, if it was written by"
4664.599999999999,4670.2," someone who's foreign policy went no further than Fox News. I mean, the entirety of his awareness"
4670.2,4675.639999999999, of like world events was delivered via Fox News. And then you tried to write a near future
4676.360000000001,4682.68," thriller on world affairs. I mean, this is the problem, right? So America gets new to dirty bomb."
4682.68,4687.56," Then it gets hate again. Then there's like, all these biological like weapons events in parts of"
4687.56,4693.72, the country. And so America decides that we need to invade Iran because of this. But this time here's
4693.72,4699.240000000001," the problem. It's a tailband. And out of Kaita, we're siding with Iran. And that's when all the"
4699.240000000001,4704.68," shit started popping off. I mean, there's one problem, right? You've got two like very, very"
4704.76,4709.08, antagonistic branches of Islam getting the other. But then here's work. It's really dumb.
4710.280000000001,4715.72," Like millions of Americans flee across the border to Canada, no one wants to fight and they somehow"
4715.72,4721.96," can't manage to um, institute a giraffe to get enough people to fight this invasion in Iran. So"
4721.96,4726.6," what they got, they got something better in mind. They make some pills that make you super strong"
4726.6,4731.72, or make you run really fast or make you fly. And then they use these pills. So that way they
4731.72,4736.52, force they need fewer soldiers. And then they can attract recruits this way. Like you can be a superhero.
4736.52,4741.320000000001," And they'll heal like if you're in a wheelchair, if you're like paraplegic or something, you take"
4741.320000000001,4748.280000000001, these super pills and you're fucking ready to roll your soldier. It's just the same shit as always.
4748.280000000001,4752.04," Yeah, they have to create a super hero. It's just about all the bad guys."
4752.04,4757.08," Also, isn't that actual for five years? Isn't that actually what the US military strategy is?"
4757.08,4761.400000000001," I mean, not the super pills, but having all the technology and fancy stuff to make a smaller force"
4761.48,4766.2," more effective. I mean, it is and it's like it's the situation that it's the way it's told and"
4766.2,4770.44," like everything else I explained. But yeah, I mean, there's that there. I mean, like I just posted"
4770.44,4775.48," a story on my Twitter today about um, people uh, I've been here to add a pause on that one too."
4777.24,4778.92," You've become that guy, Sean."
4780.92,4787.0," Shit. Have you read my, have you read my Twitter today? Well, I basically uh, past the large"
4787.08,4791.96, stool and I wanted to do no. I take a picture with my iPhone.
4794.6,4799.24," It wasn't like that, man. It was about basically you were ironically posted. There it wasn't"
4799.24,4807.72, my rock. I didn't do shit. I'm deleting that kind of stuff. That's it. That's all. All right. That's
4807.72,4814.44," about it. No, what was the story about that you posted? Oh, using advances in neuroscience to uh,"
4814.5199999999995,4819.639999999999," just translating into more effective, war fighting, dealing with uh, interrogations and"
4819.639999999999,4823.4," light detection. There's a quid in the true series. It's just suppressing uh,"
4824.599999999999,4829.08, fear and all these sorts of things being able to control uh UAVs with your mind with a sort of
4829.08,4833.879999999999," just a mental interface. You know, metal gear solid had some really interesting ideas on that."
4833.879999999999,4839.96," It did. It's just been about it. Yeah, Twitter about a rabbit. Yeah, I think uh, I think what"
4840.04,4845.56," the US really needs is not the superheroes. It just needs the East German female Olympiates,"
4845.56,4851.4," you know, from the from the from the 70s and the 60s. They read that. They read that. They"
4851.4,4856.6," broke that dude's arm. If they were wrestled that one guy who I put the video up, uh, the weight"
4856.6,4861.0," lift or the weight lift or yeah, they could probably take him in an arm wrestle. Yeah, that was a story"
4861.0,4866.12, about this. It was in the paper the other day about this East German woman who was was fed so many
4866.44,4871.32," steroids, uh, unknowingly her moves turned into Dicks. She she ended up."
4881.32,4887.5599999999995," I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not even finished. No, I read about that. That's a better story. They"
4887.5599999999995,4893.8," fed their soap. They fed her soap. Yes, that's what happens. They fed her to her. That she became a man."
4893.8,4900.52," She became a man. Yeah. Oh, I saw the before and after pictures on that. Yeah, she didn't notice though."
4901.8,4907.0," I think she noticed. I think she noted. Anyway, that your story is better. Yeah, that's the one we're going with."
4907.0,4911.56, All the segments of the land after pictures you couldn't see what was under her shirt. So it's possible.
4911.56,4918.28," She looked like a man in the before picture. I'm to be honest to be honest. Yeah, it she did. Yeah."
4919.24,4923.08, See there was some with wrote a song about her even prior to all this for the force.
4923.719999999999,4926.679999999999, Wouldn't that be lady looks like it did not do the clip away.
4929.96,4931.5599999999995, You got me in good point.
4934.28,4935.0, Bobby Tom.
4936.679999999999,4942.04, We done skip. Are we we're at our time probably. That's what I'm here. All right.
4942.92,4947.16," Ryan, do you have anything to add? No, I think that's Sean kind of"
4948.36,4954.599999999999," did as well. This could be I have nothing to add to that. What about the that comic? No. Oh, about the."
4954.599999999999,4961.4," Did you read the comic? I flipped through it. Jesus, you can't take the time to read a comic."
4961.4,4967.8," I can read this in two minutes, man. Like there's there's literally like 500 words to read."
4968.5199999999995,4974.759999999999, Maybe. Oh my god. This thing looks yeah. We're going to sit here and read a comic.
4974.76,4980.68, We're not. Okay. So we're leaving. We'll see you next week. I'm sure. Yeah. With lots of all including some space
4980.68,4988.6," each analysis, which I was going to do with Anthony. Yeah, we should give like teasers for stuff this week because we get a lot of crap coming out."
4988.6,4992.52," I mean, I think Monday we're going to be able to have a lot of stuff about the"
4993.88,4998.4400000000005, command and character Red Alert three right. We'll hand on stuff about some things that haven't been
4998.4400000000005,5003.8, discussed about the game. There's exclusive. There's an EA event tomorrow. Yep. And I'm going to be
5004.84,5008.84, playing crisis. We're at multiplayer. Expect to be able to talk about that next week. Yeah.
5008.84,5015.4800000000005, Looking at it. No more of other games there. Bobito just went on a boat cruise to see Godfather too.
5015.4800000000005,5017.0," He gets all the same. Yes, sir. He's fine."
5017.0,5023.96," I did. No one wanted to go. Oh, nobody wanted to go. I didn't know. You got the buddy on that fucking boat, man."
5023.96,5029.400000000001, I did. It's amazing. I've never been to a game event where I walked in the door and did no a single
5029.4,5035.32, person. Yeah. So out if fans are the worst because you can't get off. Yeah. It's stuck till they go back to
5035.32,5039.16, Yeah. That's why no one else won. That's why we didn't go. Yeah. So we're trying to make it like
5039.16,5044.36," your own feet and up all the gravy. Yeah, just don't want to eat. And shot Sean totally bailed because"
5044.36,5051.0," the other night. I was supposed to meet him for drinks and I'm on my way over and he's like,"
5051.0,5057.0," hey, are you? We're going to leave and I'm like, I'm outside the restaurant. He's like, yeah,"
5057.0,5061.56," we're going home. I'll make it up to you. Oh, good. This is a vent with you tomorrow. And then I showed up and"
5061.56,5066.36," Sean's like, I'm tired. Dude, we got to like, okay, now we need like his and hers version. Oh boy."
5066.36,5072.6," Now that she's had hers. Really aren't counting. Yeah. Well, we were supposed to go to have like to go"
5072.6,5076.04," have drinks, but I was like, you know, going to get dinner and stuff. Yeah. But you were like,"
5076.04,5079.48, you were late on that because you were making dinner because you had to have dinner with your wife.
5079.48,5083.8," But for me, I was like, my fridge, raiders empty and chair. Now I'm starving. So Anthony, we were like,"
5083.88,5087.16," we got to go and eat, we're starving. So we get there and we were there for a while. And then like,"
5087.16,5091.72," I have to be honest, it was crazy shit. And I think both of us felt like an imminent movement. And so"
5092.360000000001,5097.08," I didn't want to sit in that place for another, you know, half hour for you to get there. And then"
5097.08,5103.320000000001," however much longer while you ordered while I was like, I'm in danger of shooting my pants. So I called"
5103.320000000001,5107.56," you and said, hey, man, you got to turn around. And then the next day, and then I felt, I did feel"
5107.56,5112.52," guilty about it. So I was like, you know what, man, I'm going to go on that boat with you. But then the next day"
5112.52,5123.56," came and I only got a fucking boat. But that story is going to go up. And then a sport, we're going to"
5123.56,5129.8," launch a big sport thing, counting down to the game to release next month, you know, some contest."
5129.8,5136.4400000000005," And also we have a very big interview coming up. They want to say yet. Oh, yes. Very big interview"
5136.4400000000005,5141.56, with this. This week probably. I don't that's why I don't want to say yet. But but from somebody
5141.56,5145.96," yeah, big in the PC community, we have needed to hear from for a while and he spoke to me. Yeah."
5145.96,5151.320000000001, So we were going to talk to him. Look for that. I'm sorry to be asking an online about having
5151.320000000001,5155.96," a sport. I mean to tease that way, but I just kind of do. Right. You can't even say that."
5155.96,5160.84," Hey, we can't eat from it. We tell you after the show's at no hints. I kind of don't want to only"
5160.84,5165.8, just in case there's some 11th hour background. We want to get this. We want to press publish before
5165.8,5170.200000000001," we. Yes, exactly. So just to make sure that actually goes through and there's no other"
5170.28,5175.0," complications. So just watch for it. Right. Oh, so much stuff. We just got a copy of"
5175.0,5180.599999999999," playable copy of the Starcore Clear Sky into a house. Oh, yeah. Maybe if you want to cover that"
5180.599999999999,5184.04, because I'm going to be writing something in crisis warhead this weekend. So if I don't want to
5184.04,5188.44," be that, okay, cool. After this, you just have some editorial planning. Yeah. I've had a"
5188.44,5193.32," tutorial planning. That's how it worked. That's how we work. Bobita. Whoa, that was loud. Sorry."
5195.32,5199.72, So be sure to check it out on one of that come throughout the week for all your PC gaming coverage.
