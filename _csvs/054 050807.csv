225.72,231.28," Sean, do I you feel I feel like you're looking at me like you want to talk I'll talk you want me just take this thing off"
231.44,236.76, Got it. I spent the weekend messing around with game tap
237.72,243.32," Darians been talking it up for a long time. He had finally got my hands on it. Yeah, I've written up a couple times the magazine good"
243.32,246.36," You went an early adopter. Yeah, what's so"
247.32,252.6, Initial impression I was like hot damn he was right. This is really impressive stuff because
253.48,255.48, But there's always a butt
255.48,259.64, But so you know looking through and I'm seeing their tons of games all the classic systems
259.88,264.6, It's like I don't the big man maybe going into the collector shop and they got like you know that the the
264.76000000000005,269.8, 12 inch GI Joe toys he collected as a kid. He's like no the gang's all here. They got Neo Geo
269.8,274.96000000000004," They got Nintendo. They got old thoughts games. You know they had everything they had a bunch of recent games, too"
274.96000000000004,276.96000000000004, You know stuff odd the Deus Ex games
278.16,281.88, Of course the the latest stuff that's just coming out now Sam and Max missed online
282.20000000000005,285.32000000000005, But the interface is really slick and clean really accessible
285.32000000000005,290.52000000000004, I could you know download stuff in the background as I'm you know continuing to browse other games and
290.84,296.68, Importantly I was able I found out to play online with old arcade games and old
297.47999999999996,302.44," You know console games, too a fan of multiplayer component the the equivalent other emulator would patch you through to someone"
302.44,305.64," Yeah, I was playing the I was playing Nemes 70 was it. Nemes 76 or something"
305.64,308.84, Nemes 75 that's part of this story. That's coming up
309.64,313.79999999999995, Has ever said away it's so so that was one of the games I played that
314.28,315.47999999999996, Cooperatively and
315.64000000000004,321.40000000000003, Real quick on that is that the latency is an issue thought for every game which kind of socks
321.40000000000003,325.12, It's it's it's a big problem for streetfighter or something like that where it's like a frame by frame
325.12,330.72, You know getting your combos right and stuff so I can't get dumb question before you go on does it actually download the full game
330.72,333.08000000000004, Or you just playing it is it streaming is your playing it?
333.08000000000004,335.56, I don't want to play game. It does yeah for forever
336.12,341.56," Yeah, no, I mean you have to be online in order to and you have to have your membership still active with game tap"
341.56,346.52, It's not there that's something they're looking into basically a pay you know a paid-on type thing
346.52,350.36, Or you're actually buying individual games the way it's set up now you pay a membership fee
350.36,354.2, You know monthly premium which allows you access to their entire library
354.36,357.4, It's almost like a Netflix type right situation
357.4,360.36, You know and you can have like on like five at a time or something
360.36,362.04, But they also have a new yeah also have a new
362.36,366.28, Add supported model or some kind of thing where basically you can like a rotating cycle of like
367.23999999999995,372.78, 30 or maybe even more games you can just like randomly cycle through and play one of you feel like but you can't all know like you
372.78,375.97999999999996, Right okay and when you're talking about latency issues
376.67999999999995,383.67999999999995, You're talking about bad formats of just a lag in the common language is it a firewall issue?
383.67999999999995,385.67999999999995, I mean have you as a lot of problems?
385.67999999999995,390.71999999999997," No, dude. No, it's just it's just those games were made"
390.71999999999997,395.08, They weren't built with the online you know built for online code. I mean they're throwing it in there and
395.47999999999996,399.15999999999997, It makes the music stutter and all the other stuff maybe they'll find a workaround
399.15999999999997,407.62, I don't know but it was still fun. That's the point and some sort of like delaying the fun part is that I learned through the course of the weekend playing a bunch of old-ass games
407.88,408.88, some
408.88,414.64, Incontrovertible laws of old-ass arcade games and I'm gonna I'm gonna read those off to you
414.64,419.56, I jotted some notes down as I was playing but the other the other last thing I wanted to say about the service was that
420.4,423.08, They've got it loaded up with all this video content
423.08,426.56, So you know while you're downloading a game you might be able to watch a video of some
426.76,433.2, You know editors in the game press talk about talk about why the game was so great not really really
433.2,440.15999999999997, Can we dodge the bullet on there some there some you know can't talk and talk too much shakes or some people in this building really
440.15999999999997,442.4," In this podcast, but in this building that that are on there"
443.96,449.28," But no, it was funny they came through and I was like there reason I can't do this. I can't do this because it's too much like"
449.28,451.28," No, the old-time life-bub music collection"
452.35999999999996,458.03999999999996," Yeah, who could remember the hook of forget these golden great. Yeah, and I didn't want to be like that newly old person"
458.03999999999996,463.88," Yeah, oh man Frogger I could cross the street and you know you either get run over by car"
463.88,466.44," You cross the street. No, I mean so basically they're doing that"
470.44,472.44, The horse for all of these things
474.71999999999997,475.91999999999996, But there's a
475.92,481.28000000000003, Kidding there's one guy on there for a street walk another website and he's talking about fantasy star too
481.56,483.56, But the saddest thing is he
483.56,488.84000000000003, spoils the biggest plot event in that entire game in the course as you're downloading the game
488.84000000000003,490.56," It's like thanks asshole, you know like"
490.88,494.40000000000003, It'd be like if you're you know it's 1982 or whatever and you're you're you're not downloading
494.40000000000003,501.20000000000005, Did it's not a spoiler if the game came out 25 years ago? I don't care man if they're trying to sell you on this like telling you why this game's cool
501.20000000000005,504.16," Okay, look you can't win if you already played it 20 years ago"
504.16,506.96000000000004, Why do you need this guy telling you that what the big fucking surprises?
507.68,511.68, I mean if I tell you that Darth Vader was Luke's dad. Is that a spoiler now?
512.96,518.4, Statue limitations is over. You know the okay. I do when I went and saw King Kong and if he yeah
518.4,521.76, I went with some friends and this buddy of mine's girlfriend cried
522.32,524.32, It's like I
524.32,526.32, The monkey died
526.32,528.32, Are you in
528.32,530.32, The monkey died
530.32,534.6400000000001, I didn't get to be no she thought like somehow like the planes were gonna come with the net
534.6400000000001,536.6400000000001, He was gonna jump off in a trampoline or something
536.6400000000001,538.0, What's that was gonna happen?
538.0,542.8000000000001," I'm gonna throw barrels down something that's right. Well, that's kind of sweet. You're gonna save the princess. It's gonna be great"
543.9200000000001,546.5600000000001," envy that position. Yeah, that's true though"
546.96,552.5600000000001, So spending the time with all these games was primarily arcade games that I played a lot of new geostop
552.5600000000001,554.5600000000001, I played ghost pilot
554.88,557.8399999999999," Kizzoon attack battle, which I call kizzoon attack disaster"
559.1199999999999,564.7199999999999," Kaptant command was a old Capcom arcade game, but anyway a bunch of stuff like that and in the course of a"
564.7199999999999,570.9599999999999," NAM 75 importantly because this is important. Okay, so I learned the laws of all that arcade games"
571.92,579.04, And one is is this one is just to get you started everyone knows this one but it's all that games are the electronic equivalent of a pan andlers
579.3599999999999,582.3199999999999, Except there's spare some change signs of airplanes with tank trades on them
583.2,587.0400000000001, Two the infinite quarters creating atmosphere of infinite apathy
587.7600000000001,594.0, Followed by three which is agreeing to use only a predetermined amount of continues creates an atmosphere pre-determined apathy
594.24,599.12," Yeah, we'll add in a ruckus you do these. We want to comment if you want to comment you can I'll say my questions"
599.12,606.6400000000001, The first ones are are are self self explain Torbit go on. I just want to the apathy thing. Why is it apathy?
607.2,611.84," It could be a is sadness depression whatever. I mean, it's okay. Bad feelings. Okay, okay"
611.9200000000001,617.6, It's you right I get to now okay sadness and depression. I I can you can that I get yeah
617.6,619.6, That's you can relate to that
621.6,626.88, You're like okay like what's going on here's another quarter don't even ask just just drop it in the slide
627.76,633.2, So then we have a mathematical proof. I don't know the name can calculate the precise point at which crab
633.2,635.84, You game stopped being funny and becomes suicide lead oppressive
636.88,638.88, That formula is
638.88,646.16, X black man in denim vests times y respawning midgets times z quarter spent equals a number of nanoseconds
646.16,648.16, You could play before the sadness sets in
649.92,658.8," Yeah, I did if then okay explaining your actions as exercise in gaming literacy reduces the apathy depression and sadness of loss two three and four"
659.68,662.24, So in other words if you say that in print
663.52,668.64, Tested on this I think I have any number two pencil answer this question. So if you if you say instead that
669.2,672.24," Not just playing some old ass games, but I'm becoming more game literate"
672.96,678.88, Then you're not gonna feel so apathetic depressed and say I see you're educating yourself you either that or you're creating
678.88,682.88, Or literature you're performing intellectual acrobatics to alleviate your own
683.4399999999999,689.36," Uh-huh, you know the psychological trauma you know this weekend. I played a paper boy on Xbox library"
689.36,694.24, Kate and I miss I came in the arcade when it first came out so everyone's in a while around one upper
694.24,697.44, Whatever people will like reminisce about paper boy and I thought like fuck
697.44,701.44, I don't know what they're talking about so now I did you see now there's a game. See I did that you
702.0,705.28, Better literally and I but I should let you know the end of the paper boy story though
705.28,707.52, I have so my
707.6800000000001,710.08, God if someone had said at the end you get around over by
713.04,715.04, I run it for everybody
715.04,717.04, Sorry
718.64,720.0, You wait for more of this bullseye
721.6800000000001,723.6800000000001," Okay, the boss isn't shoot em up"
724.24,729.52," Okay, and pardon the language here the bosses and shoot em ups or schmups if you're fucking more on our polish jokes"
729.84,731.84, Our Polish joke science fair projects
732.08,737.04, You never know if it's gonna be a helicopter with an ejection seat or the submarine with a screen door and he'd seeking fireballs
737.04,740.24, But you can bet it'll suck and that is based especially on
741.44,748.64," Where a boss okay, well goes pilot a boss who come to a tank right and if you can imagine now like a a sliding"
749.6,755.4399999999999, rail on the tank that that allows the turret to move left and right okay while still facing forward
755.68,757.68," Okay, that was an example"
757.68,762.88, And then you fight this big plane and after you blow up all you know all the turrets and missiles
763.1999999999999,766.72, Guys parachuting in the background. They're not even going anywhere you're standing on top of playing yourself
766.72,768.3199999999999, It's like hey guys coming through
768.3199999999999,771.84," You know, they're just like they're that determined to get one shot at you that they just parachute by"
771.84,775.76, But then when it's all done the engines of the plane start shooting napolm at you
776.08,781.84, Like the props to the plane and then next level you go on a tour through the barrel factory
781.84,787.6, We make fun of barrels and games like this game has like the origin of those barrels like it's all these conveyor belts with the barrels
787.6,789.84, Come through barrel co-shoot and then there's like a
790.4,792.8," When this machine comes out, I mean you got a laugh like it"
793.12,797.6, It's like a wrecking ball with two two wrecking balls on it and it's just like dropping them trying to smash you
797.76,803.3, But it's so messed up that like when the balls descend on you rather than getting larger to indicate you know
803.4599999999999,808.18, Perspective it's just random they get big and small at all these various points as they go up and down
808.74,816.5," But um, I don't know that's that's some pretty well. I didn't get the whole polish jokin algae there. It's at the skate a Polish joke science fair project would be"
817.3,819.6999999999999, This is failing because you have no sense in here. We're dude
821.4599999999999,826.02, Oh the joke's not funny because I don't get it not cuz of jokes. It never heard like okay
826.18,830.5, You know like the dumb Polish jokes if you heard about the latest pollution mention
830.82,836.1," You know they're flying to the sun they're going at night. Yeah, you know, I mean they got a helicopter with an ejection scene"
836.1,840.5, So like that's basically you take the dumbest the dumbest most stereotypical joke for something
840.5,845.22, But then the the designer said that's gonna be a badass way to in this level. You know
846.42,848.42, Throw that in there
848.82,851.7," Okay, so these these ones you'll be you'll be able to get this one Jeff"
853.06,855.06, Let me tell you something
855.06,860.42, When Johnny Carson who probably was retired before you were born or whatever when he when he bomb
860.58,866.5, This jokes he didn't go to the audience. Hey you guys are stupid. He took the credit for the joke sucking
867.3,869.3, Some blame me
869.3,873.14, Joe to a wider audience that you then you just you're just a bystander
873.78,875.78, People out there
875.78,877.78," No, I represent all the dumb people"
878.58,880.42," Okay, well, it's suck. I'll take the blame"
880.42,886.02," Thank you. Um, okay. I remember that game does not equal that was a great game no matter what your memory says"
886.66,891.3, And then finally if games are master-betary old ass games or serious women's wear catalogs
891.9399999999999,893.9399999999999, Like that just that shit
893.9399999999999,897.14," There you go, I can't satisfy a bone on my body anymore"
897.86,898.98," Yeah, that's real"
898.98,901.14, You know what I still have my share catalog a better
903.14,904.74," Actually, I'll make this here. It's catalog"
905.6999999999999,906.74, Do they?
906.74,908.5, I wasn't ready for it to go that direction
908.9,912.34, It was an annual ban you open the door you walk through it. It's just how it goes
912.82,915.86," Actually, so what's nice to have when I was 13. No, that was long time"
915.86,917.86, That was a good backup. Yeah
918.1,921.62, You're actually so you're saying you will play just just the arcade games over the weekend
921.86,923.3000000000001," Yeah, I know this bunch of other stuff"
923.3000000000001,927.0600000000001," Well, I'm just saying I know like you're kind of you know a relative newcomer to the PC space"
927.0600000000001,931.3000000000001, I mean they have a lot of like a lot of classics on there too like I mean I was still in your earlier XCOM and
931.5400000000001,935.46," Yeah, I'm too tired of the deepest on there now. Totally. I mean like actually like one of my favorites"
935.86,938.6600000000001, Interstate 76 is on there now. Oh my god. That game was great
938.9000000000001,940.9000000000001," That was unbelievable in that came out. Yeah, that was"
941.38,948.02, That's set the tone stuff like GTA it totally dead. It was all it was heavy for characters and yeah
948.02,951.86, Totally got sucked into that world they built for that and if they hadn't fucked up 82
952.66,956.98," Frances could have gone on well the 80s weren't as cool as the 70s. Yeah, right that was her mistake"
957.78,959.78, What the house
961.14,966.66," Yeah, 80s with the best comics ever the 80s right been interstate 77 after because it's gone up a year"
968.1,970.1, I hear that time left commercial
970.9,974.26, That's the whole point. You see that game's down. When nostalgia when nostalgia is a factor
974.26,978.8199999999999, You have to be wary in the same way that like I convinced my friend Rory to play these games with me and I told him
978.8199999999999,979.86, I started off
979.86,984.34, Damn 75 this was like the illness hit back when and then we were in that we played it
984.34,990.66, We were like no one three minutes in there when we realized all it was is like throw us many grenades as you came before you have to put another quarter in and continue
990.9,996.26, Because like so wait bullets coming at you to try to eat up your money. I think it would say 76 would hold up
996.9,1000.5799999999999, There haven't been many get this was car combat and it was done right yeah
1001.38,1007.86, It was actually using the McWare you're a McWare you're a McWare you're two engine you ever you ever recommend to us
1007.86,1011.4599999999999, Whippersnappers like you know an older album or something or like when you're gonna give to your daughter
1011.4599999999999,1015.78, You're trying to turn around so you know I'm saying it's good like in in many cases
1016.02,1020.5799999999999, And a great of music and games are are vastly different but I was saying what I think is similar is that
1021.14,1025.06, Like elite I'm assuming you do it's what I do is I listen to it first to get into make sure
1025.78,1028.34, Like remember and things right that I play it again
1028.34,1034.6599999999999, Like and then you try to try to if I care you say okay like I've got my daughter's ears on what is this gonna say like and then it passes that test
1034.6599999999999,1037.3799999999999, Then you go then you can say but that's just that's my test
1037.3799999999999,1041.62, But that's all I remember and it means my daughter's gonna do that no matter how cool the music is
1041.62,1044.58," It the fact that it's from me means it shit. Yeah, okay"
1044.58,1049.06, So not your daughter. I'm saying it says Ryan or so you've got to actively avoid talking about cool stuff
1049.06,1053.86, So she doesn't hate it forever right and if I mentioned things like cuz like red hot chili peppers
1053.86,1057.86, It's cool to her but if I tell her that the lead singer is actually like a year younger than me
1058.6599999999999,1062.58, Then they're not going you know she was like horrified to find out that the date was in this 40s
1062.8999999999999,1066.58, Now they're not going she'll hit that that's the way to ruin it point though
1066.58,1071.3799999999999, Which is like you know maybe three or four years from now now I told her like one day you're gonna realize
1071.3799999999999,1075.06, I got like you know hundreds of CDs here that are cool and you're gonna want to borrow
1075.06,1078.4199999999998," She's like yeah, I don't think so dad she's into like cheek a roan right now, right?"
1078.98,1080.1, You know like
1080.1,1080.5, Ali and
1080.5,1081.4599999999998, Hey
1081.4599999999998,1082.5, Oh
1082.5,1084.5, Like when's the funny and
1085.22,1087.78, What is it anything on the phone the top shelf of the
1087.78,1090.42, Obtarget or something is that your greatest fear though?
1090.42,1094.5, She's gonna you're gonna come home and she's like my homes my homes my let you like
1095.7,1097.22, It's already happening yeah
1097.22,1103.06, Kelly Clarkson a kind all this bullshit sorry for all the Kelly Clarkson and a con fans listening
1103.46,1105.3799999999999," Really, they're great and he looks right at me"
1105.3799999999999,1107.3799999999999, I took a cross over
1109.3799999999999,1111.3799999999999, Clarkson Fed
1111.3799999999999,1116.02, You check this check this for a transition you were playing an old ass game yourself this weekend
1116.1,1121.62, But reborn on Xbox I was sick I was it brings it back a little bit more to the PC
1122.18,1124.18, Sort of
1126.18,1130.5, I played Katan on Xbox I varcade here's how we can make the PC
1131.54,1137.46, Parallel it was done by it's done by big huge games at the Brian Reynolds one of the great
1137.78,1139.78, PC game developers
1139.78,1141.78, Big huge games made of course the
1142.98,1144.98, Rise of Legends games
1145.54,1146.5, Have they done anything else?
1146.5,1147.54, Is it just us?
1147.54,1149.54, I think will they just rise the nations rise the legends?
1149.54,1154.82," Yeah, they just came out and that was their first game rise the nations right and they just did a port of"
1155.6200000000001,1158.66, Settlers of Katan which is one of the great board games
1159.3,1163.3, When did that come out you guys know any built cheese oh god probably like
1165.06,1169.14, Early early 90s yeah that seems one of the amazing
1169.14,1175.22, From Germany board game in ports where all great board games now are spawn true very true
1176.42,1178.42, Just a brilliant
1178.42,1180.66, Is that me make a noise who's making noise?
1181.22,1183.22, There we go silenced
1183.22,1187.8600000000001," Well each other who was being bad was it me look at your hand. Oh, yeah, it was"
1188.9,1191.3000000000002, I was telling Ryan to quit twist in this court
1192.8200000000002,1198.0200000000002," Anyway, so a big huge games made this game available for Xbox I'm a kid I think it came out on Wednesday"
1198.66,1200.02, And it's a pretty brilliant
1200.74,1205.94, Translation of that board game. I'm so addicted to it. I actually dropped about it last night. Uh-oh
1205.94,1211.06," Which is a good and bad sign, you know you know any play a game like two late at night and you go to bed"
1211.06,1213.06, And you haven't wand out you haven't had a good transition
1213.54,1217.78, So then you're laying in bed in the cards or flipping or whatever you're playing and he's bricks
1219.3,1224.58, Not so that was doing I just need one more sheep card you're waking up honey. I've got the longest road
1224.6599999999999,1229.86," My army is huge like yeah, I go back to bed"
1231.06,1235.78," Yeah, so it's a it's a pretty awesome. I didn't play any multiplayer and I've heard a little bit of"
1236.6599999999999,1240.1, I was reading a little bit of nightmare stories about some of the net code with that
1240.5,1246.34," But uh, and also I bet with reading people griping about the AI possibly cheating a little bit"
1248.1,1253.46, In this game it's way too hard to explain the concepts of this game in the in detail on a podcast
1254.42,1261.94, There's a die roll to beginning and if you get a seven seven is the the fuck you die roll and what you get to screw another player
1261.94,1264.42, And it's always gonna be the guy who's in in the lead
1264.98,1271.7, There's a lot of people complaining on on the message boards that the seven start rolling against you as soon as you're about to beat the AI
1272.1000000000001,1276.58, All of a sudden a three AI opponent's magically start rolling seven's on oh man that would
1277.22,1282.42, That sounds about right it happened to me once last night. I did I have you need ten points to win the game
1282.5,1288.8200000000002, The points come very slowly so you know it's it takes a while to get up there and I had a nine nine points
1288.98,1293.7," Yeah, the guys were at like four and five and then was a string of seven center row and"
1294.18,1298.74," I ended up losing and at which point you threw the control it out as they fucking yeah, there was a little bit of that going on"
1298.74,1299.78, Yeah
1299.78,1304.74, Sheading with dice little lame however it was also set that you can
1305.94,1308.9, When the game's over you can click on some stuff to get a
1309.46,1312.1000000000001, You know a full on review of the die rolls and
1312.5,1315.94, Apparently if you if you follow it it actually does even out over time
1315.94,1321.94, They're apparently so who the seven supposed to come up the most anyway? Well that's right because this statistical probability of certain numbers
1323.3000000000002,1324.98, I guess
1324.98,1330.26, So stay stay static issues though interesting you how it always waits towards right when it's the year for a fair time
1330.66,1332.66," Yeah, however"
1332.66,1337.38, It's a really really if you're at all like a turn-based strategy fan a PC
1337.6200000000001,1339.6200000000001, Strategy fan
1339.6200000000001,1345.22, It's if you haven't played the board game. I still highly recommend this if you have a F box 360
1345.22,1349.46, I don't know why this doesn't end on the PC. It really should be you know if there's any plans for it
1349.46,1353.8600000000001, Have you heard anything do not know if big huge games is listening now please port katon
1353.8600000000001,1358.8200000000002, You like it more into the right there was like a not as graphical version of it on like MSN games
1358.8200000000002,1365.14," You might be right there might be a low rent version. Yeah, well take it to ride is sort of like a lower rent version of"
1366.1000000000001,1371.46," Souther self-gaton not to disc it to ride because I love that came immensely, but it's kind of a simpler"
1371.8600000000001,1374.5800000000002, Simple rules version of a similar concept
1374.5800000000002,1377.8600000000001," Right, would you say is that fair if I'd play to get to ride?"
1377.8600000000001,1383.0," I can't do it but no one you and your genius for games. Oh, I agree. Yeah, I knew I had you on the pie"
1383.0,1385.0, For a reason
1385.0,1386.6000000000001," Yes, genius pay"
1387.94,1393.44," Yeah, sort of like you know your built your collecting resources and building roads and the similar idea"
1394.4,1400.24, Anyway great game. I recommend it. I also played more Lord of the Rings online still holding up
1400.88,1406.8, Still a lot of funds to play Clarenet still playing my clarinet. I think I'm on one up show next week
1406.8,1409.1200000000001, light and plug for that playing the
1410.0,1412.0, Clarenet
1412.0,1415.66, I've never heard any play chopsticks on the clarinet before that we know so that's skillful
1416.4,1419.28," I don't know if I don't know if culture ain't could even do that too. No, it's not one"
1419.28,1421.68, I'm telling you like I come back next week to be able to play
1422.24,1427.68, The theme from close encounters and the theme from Beverly Hills cop really a little axle F
1427.68,1432.04, You could pull you could like you could whip out this game said he was playing scary to have it on his lived
1432.68,1435.8400000000001," Okay, I don't buy that. I don't buy that for a second. That's too many notes man"
1435.8400000000001,1438.48, You can hit either the examples I mentioned with like no more than four
1439.28,1441.28, Really or five. I don't know I'm not a musician
1443.6000000000001,1448.14," Anyway, so I was playing that how about you other folks Ryan or you are you playing games?"
1448.6200000000001,1454.0," No, I tried to play world of warcraft, but you weren't into it. Well my account"
1454.0,1458.24," I have to get another time card. Oh, yes, that's the problem"
1458.74,1464.42, And I have 25 years accounts like some people do it. It's 14 or it's 15 dollars
1465.22,1467.22, Am I paying these at little
1467.9,1468.9, Maybe
1468.9,1474.72," Okay, I didn't want to play that bad so you're answered a way you're playing this week was nothing but it would have been wow"
1474.98,1476.98," Yeah, okay, you're fired"
1477.5,1483.82, Dan I was playing for a little bit this weekend some somewhere between 80 and 90 degrees before my computer
1483.82,1489.02," Actually had a meltdown. Oh, did it really yeah, the heat here. Well, I think it's I yeah was was ungodly hot"
1489.5,1493.78, Awesomely hot this weekend. I have I live in a top floor apartment with a lot of windows
1493.78,1498.6200000000001, So all the sunlights come pouring in not enough ventilation and as I'm trying to play what the hell is it?
1498.6200000000001,1500.6200000000001, That was that put it over the edge
1500.62,1502.62, Um
1503.1799999999998,1505.1799999999998, Blank right now
1507.1799999999998,1510.1799999999998, Except the blank the electric blanket that I put over
1510.1799999999998,1515.1," Yeah, you know what my PC shut down spontaneously last night and I think it was from the heat too"
1515.7399999999998,1519.58, You're having a freaking like weird heat wave here in San Francisco
1519.86,1522.3799999999999," Yes, so basically like my computer actually had a meltdown"
1522.3799999999999,1527.06," And I just said okay time to go outside for five minutes. I actually enjoyed some sunlight this weekend for a change. Well, was that like"
1527.3799999999999,1530.78," It was weird, but there was a lot of alcohol involved since we think of tomorrow so okay"
1531.1799999999998,1532.86, Always a good always a good thing
1532.86,1535.98, It sat I was off for like two hours and they got a sunburn
1537.74,1542.5," That was very sad. I don't room full of Dracula. Oh, yeah, yeah"
1542.8999999999999,1545.7, Bell are you playing a PC game? I am though
1546.1799999999998,1551.22, Mostly this weekend. I was playing the fool. I was actually at the Renaissance fair in Southern California with my band
1552.26,1555.98, Though I did introduce my world of workcraft killed on stage on Sunday
1556.06,1560.78," Awesome, since a lot of them were there. That was pretty goofy including Shakespeare and the hot chick who's on the"
1561.26,1566.26, Billboards are both my guilt. So that was really yeah big you know we got geek all over everybody
1566.26,1567.26, But it was good kudos
1567.9,1571.78, What what is your band tells us the epoxy boggards is a group that does
1573.14,1574.54, Renaissance
1574.54,1577.1, Period sounding drinking songs
1577.1,1582.64," Huh, you know, so basically it's pushing it to rock and roll band, but you know have lutes and bod runs and not clear now"
1582.64,1586.44, Have a real loot in your band. We have a mandalins and war ons and
1587.0400000000002,1590.24," Suzuki he's a sense of fact, but we do you know"
1590.24,1593.76," Have you did a theme for our podcast? Yeah, we get one of those together. Damn"
1594.76,1599.5800000000002, That would be an energy play bill. I'd sing in that group actually play anything
1600.76,1605.4," Which mainly because I'm not down there anymore, so it's tough the instrument ones have to practice a lot more together"
1605.92,1609.0400000000002," But yes, the voice isn't there's the human voice"
1609.04,1610.12, The instrument
1610.12,1614.46, So I get to go down there and and hang out with the guys usually a couple times per run and do that
1615.0,1620.7," And it's a lot of fun. Are you in period costume? Yes. Yeah, I'm a down there in costume on stage"
1621.2,1623.2, Speaking with a British accent
1623.2,1626.32, Which happens to be the wall craft accent. He's the same voice
1626.76,1631.2, Which sometimes people get they're like oh that sounds really familiar and I'll say the town is under attack
1631.2,1633.2, Oh
1636.48,1640.9, Why said that why is British the default accent whenever like he looked at a game?
1641.14,1645.92, And it's like I show a friend a screen or something. He's just like it's gonna be British accents in that like yeah
1645.92,1650.04," That's like I think it's default fancy even like Rome, you know you watch it's a default"
1650.04,1652.04, Roman accent
1652.04,1656.64," That's what that's what I'm getting that yeah, we're not applicable in your case. It is, but now"
1656.64,1661.1000000000001, It's true. I think I'd say where it's he that's the easy one people go right to that. Oh foreign land a British
1661.72,1663.24, Right there
1663.24,1664.96, Though I it was interesting
1664.96,1671.48, So I played tons of well and it's actually a great way or I stay connected to a lot of my friends down in Southern California
1672.0,1673.3600000000001, I
1673.3600000000001,1674.3200000000002, Was
1674.3200000000002,1677.5200000000002, Organizing some stuff on my office and I came across one of my
1678.1200000000001,1682.92, 40 copies of Carcasson the board game versions I have which is another fantastic
1682.92,1687.9," Yeah, I came out of Germany. Yeah, that's built around city building and roads and"
1688.74,1693.4, And cities and farming and this again again. It's pretty complex to try to describe
1693.4,1697.6000000000001," Yeah, but really easy rules. I'm one of the great things about that game is that every time you play"
1697.92,1702.16, It's tile-based so you lay down tiles so it's a random game every single time you play
1702.44,1706.3000000000002, You're randomly building the whole area and the other thing it's fun about it is that in the rules
1706.8000000000002,1710.8400000000001, You kibits so someone flips a tile over and then everyone is encouraged to say oh
1710.9599999999998,1713.6, You should put that here because that'll give you this no no no no no no that you go
1713.6,1717.48," So everyone's kind of like arguing for something that does good for you, but doesn't screw them"
1717.6799999999998,1722.84, So it's a very fun dynamic and when I was cleaning up these different versions
1722.84,1724.6799999999998, I have it I found a box that had
1725.6399999999999,1732.1999999999998," One of the expansions for that game these river tiles, but in it also had this like demo version of"
1732.4399999999998,1737.6, The game in German for the PC so I installed it on my laptop so I've been like that's my guy
1737.7199999999998,1740.8, Little fun games like all in German so first time I got
1741.8,1745.0," Verloss and oh God's closed damn you know, so it's a kind of learn"
1745.6,1751.76," My basic PC gaming German now, but I've been actually playing that it was fun and the internet went out at my hotel"
1752.32,1760.24, On Sunday night before I came back up today and I looked at my all my hot bar items like online online online
1760.24,1762.24," Oh, oh, Carcasson"
1762.24,1765.52," That was the one thing I had on my computer didn't quite have any going online, so"
1766.08,1772.28, Playing playing in the streets at the fair this weekend playing some carcasson online
1772.28,1777.8799999999999," Which I know they're gonna be doing for the live arcade. Yeah, I've arcade which is it's kind of funny the games"
1777.8799999999999,1779.84, I've been the most excited about a library. I like
1780.16,1784.8," Uno and board games and you know, though the smack talking you know is played a lot of"
1784.8,1791.6," You ever trade your toys with other kids when you're a little kid. Yeah, like that sounds like a good good example of like if you excelled at that"
1791.6,1796.6399999999999," You would like the carcasson part, you know, it's like your friends got jet fire the transformers"
1796.6399999999999,1800.1799999999998, And maybe you got like some bus it asks like handshoeing Mexico robot that blows
1801.1799999999998,1805.1999999999998, And you got to tell him that like you know this thing sturdy this thing's old school
1805.48,1808.3999999999999, We're gonna make up your trip bus it asked me in Japan transfer
1808.3999999999999,1812.36, You don't want that you don't want that by the end of the session. He's like I don't want this thing man
1812.36,1815.1999999999998," This is right. Oh, so that's what carcasson is all about all right"
1815.1999999999998,1820.6799999999998, And that's what I like about it. It's got that that actual dynamic where you're you're trying to convince of the guys do that
1820.68,1827.78, So I'm actually looking for to be able to play that online with people and I do you I do you hope that they they take maybe it'd be a great package
1827.78,1834.78, I would completely buy you know like like two or three board games like kind of like just kickass multiplayer board games
1834.78,1840.3200000000002," Yeah, for the PC and sit there and plan it'd be great. Yeah, I do I hope Katan does well on library cake"
1840.3200000000002,1842.3200000000002, Cause maybe that'll be a good
1842.3200000000002,1848.1000000000001, Does it use the camera the the webcam for Xbox? I do not know the answer. Yeah
1848.1,1850.3999999999999, I don't think it was have a camera saw
1851.6,1853.6, And if I had one I wouldn't set it up
1853.6,1861.04," What do you need to see? I don't want to see it. Oh, there's this mod where you both set up your cameras and you roll your own die and you hold it up to the camera"
1864.3,1866.3, And you look I got a seven again
1867.3,1869.3, See
1869.3,1871.3, No doubt
1872.02,1877.24," Sean what was I playing yeah, I was playing wow. I was actually playing well you are yeah"
1878.1,1880.5, Still working on my old still haven't gone back to my other character
1880.5,1885.54," I think I was kind of your mains kind of dead. Yeah, the guild drama killed that guy pretty much"
1886.86,1890.1, But I'm over 40 now so I'm trying to save up for my mount again
1890.58,1896.58, Which is well class good dude. Are you feeling any sense of like I don't know
1897.4599999999998,1901.34," Like I've done this before already. Oh, yeah, why am I can't wait to get that land again?"
1902.1,1905.4599999999998," I mean least we're in Stylthorn now, which is a lot more interesting than some of the other"
1906.1000000000001,1908.1000000000001, Earlier zones that are just like
1912.1000000000001,1915.66, I mean we've done it before but it's still fun yeah
1916.3,1921.46, Playing that and I was also I'm only bringing it's not a PC. I'm gonna bring it up and you'll see why I'm bringing it up
1921.46,1923.46, A lot of Pokemon
1923.7,1925.7, for the DS
1925.7,1926.7, They're
1926.7,1931.14, And they would make an awesome memo. That's all. The only thing I'm more sick of you in about the warcraft's Pokemon
1932.1000000000001,1937.46," We haven't mentioned that the P you were done this podcast. Oh, because ever obvious reasons. Yeah"
1938.0200000000002,1945.0400000000002, But I'm just saying awesome. I'm just hoping I was playing it. I was like the mechanics are already there
1945.3000000000002,1951.74, Okay craft you're already fighting other trainers out in the world like that's the whole mind that make the mother players
1952.3000000000002,1954.98, So how we had already out's called Habo hotel
1955.38,1957.38, It had a hotel
1957.46,1959.46, Habo hotel
1959.46,1963.0600000000002, My poker works like like pass a digital pacifier for a little kid
1965.7800000000002,1969.46, Like actually Habo hotels like it's basically like a
1970.9,1975.3000000000002, Virtually I mean it's like it's a space where a bunch of different kids can go in and play and there's like
1975.38,1979.8600000000001, You know they make their own bedrooms and stuff with then there like might be like a community pool or playground
1979.8600000000001,1984.74, But then a bunch of like reapers from something awful forms or something will get together
1984.74,1989.78," Like the tens thousand so much about that right, but and then just go in there and like stand in doorways and like"
1990.18,1992.18, Just do as well as
1992.18,1996.26, The browser game that looks like the e-boiled art kind of like it does yeah
1996.26,1998.26," Yeah, I"
1998.26,2000.26, Pokemon MMO
2000.26,2004.5," See I'm not alone. Yeah, but there's some big news there's some big news about"
2004.9,2006.9, World of Starcraft this week so
2008.18,2010.98, There we go. We don't really have time to talk about you playing Pokemon
2011.78,2013.78, We have more pressing matters
2014.74,2016.74, There's a lot of stuff is now
2016.74,2018.74, You're just gonna stifle any Pokemon
2019.94,2026.18, What's like on every podcast and video show and everything on that like there's nothing left to be said about I haven't even body yet
2026.18,2028.02, Dude so I have nothing to talk about
2028.02,2034.34, And it's only the only way that can get worse is if someone says Pokemons and it's supposed to be a punch line on the show
2035.54,2040.02, How would you use that as a poke as a punch line like you as a joke and the punch line
2040.5,2044.34, Or just simply saying and expecting expecting Mary-Mitten murder a rub
2047.62,2049.62, See
2049.62,2052.2599999999998, She's gonna scoop that that better how about this one interwebs
2054.34,2056.34," All right, full show yeah"
2056.34,2058.34, Speaking of interwebs
2058.34,2063.38, There was the rumor got all out of control this weekend so we don't and we don't know we don't know shit here
2063.86,2068.02, At this magazine I don't know the build you know shit. I don't know anything build doesn't know anything either
2068.98,2072.02, Total idle rampant speculation. No something
2074.02,2077.7," Yeah, no, I believe he does yeah because they call me right away"
2079.3,2081.3," Hey, you know work here anymore"
2081.3,2083.94," We don't have been in about four years, but we want to run a couple things by"
2085.06,2089.38," Yeah, that's we don't have a game come out that's online, but he has idea and what do you do with this?"
2089.86,2096.18," So yeah, so I mean it's sort of been like ever since they announced that they were having this event on May 19th in South Korea"
2096.18,2101.06, It's been sort of like everybody's been saying starcraft to the starcraft to without anybody really knowing anything
2101.06,2104.58, But then who were the folks that broke at this weekend computer
2105.3799999999997,2111.3799999999997, CVG either video games said that they supposedly had like credible inside sources that said it is a starcraft
2112.3399999999997,2115.7, Universe MMO right did they use a phrase MMO?
2116.3399999999997,2120.22," Yeah, we're getting not like world of warcraft pretty much like a world of starcraft"
2120.74,2122.74, Sorry to game
2122.74,2125.62, Apparently that galaxy of starcraft though if you
2126.18,2128.18, You're not a world world
2128.18,2130.58, Yeah world oh star universe
2131.7,2133.7," Yeah, yeah, more I don't know"
2133.7,2139.54, If multiple version of multiverse DC killed multiverse for me
2141.2999999999997,2144.2599999999998, I don't know what is there even to talk about we because we don't know shit
2144.2599999999998,2149.54, Maybe it is worlds of starcraft if I guess if it is you think that's a good idea
2149.54,2151.54, Don't you ride I think that's pretty awesome
2151.94,2154.1," I mean, if you get to have like a fun"
2154.74,2156.74, Accessible sci-fi MMO that
2157.38,2159.7799999999997, You know it took off really well in the mainstream
2159.7799999999997,2163.94, We don't have one yet you are it just seems it seems early to me
2163.94,2167.7, But then like the more I think about it doesn't seem early to be announced you get this close to like
2168.18,2172.58, World of Warcraft having like not even peak jet like I have one expansion out and
2173.14,2178.02, And then like I think I still have a thunder from it already by an ounce and people when you guys announced
2178.82,2180.82, What a warcraft that was in
2181.38,2185.06, 2000 all right that you are still there yeah
2186.7400000000002,2193.54, Mine of the little letter than that I mean it was one thing that I think Blizzard always done for better or for worse is a lot of lead time on announcements
2195.3,2197.86, Though usually that's because there's this crazy goal in mind
2197.86,2201.86," I wouldn't might actually get done and then you start devic and you're like oh, yeah, we really want this to be incredible"
2201.86,2203.86, So it's gonna take one
2204.26,2209.2200000000003, I have my whole other theory which I don't think is it's more it's a MMO though
2209.62,2215.4599999999996," Really I think it's sarcasm to see I think I'm gonna run that I think there's some yeah, and there's there's reasons"
2215.4599999999996,2218.1, You're seeing a dark crash. This is why I had my whole theory
2218.1,2223.7799999999997," Okay, and and I my disclaimer is I do not know I have one"
2224.5,2227.9399999999996, Starcraft is a landmark title in Korea
2228.4199999999996,2232.8199999999997, Really there's book star economics that talks about how it totally really you know
2233.46,2239.06," Made a massive amount of money over there not just for Blizzard, but for the economy of Korea"
2239.06,2242.5800000000004, They the whole game rooms the PC bonds are all set up around those
2243.06,2246.02," You know, and it's just this massive powerful force over there"
2246.7400000000002,2250.5800000000004, To the game went gold in the US on March 27th in
2251.2200000000003,2257.2200000000003," 97 and so I'm I'd have to really think on a little more, but I'm guessing"
2257.8599999999997,2260.4199999999996, Probably with localization time and shipping
2260.98,2265.06, Sometime in May would probably be maybe when it actually not in Korea
2265.2999999999997,2269.06, So I in my head I'm sensing this 10 year okay anniversary
2269.62,2272.74, Starcraft is so huge they still play it there's professional leagues
2273.22,2274.74," You know, and if they were gonna be"
2275.3799999999997,2278.98, ever gonna be announcing a star a starcraft product. It's gonna be in Korea
2278.98,2281.7799999999997," Right, I just think that you know, they've they've hired"
2282.4199999999996,2284.4199999999996, Blizzard's hired guys that worked
2285.14,2288.7400000000002, On and I came to who was but the lead designer from one of the scene see franchises
2288.7400000000002,2292.1, I recall we've got a lot of RTS routes there and strengths there
2292.34,2296.26, It's still a great genre set in comms been getting great reviews and doing really well and
2296.7400000000002,2299.86," You know, I just think that I wouldn't be surprised at all"
2299.86,2301.54, I and I hope it is
2301.54,2305.86, Honestly because you have I love craft I would love another starcraft art yes
2305.86,2307.86, What if it was like a
2307.86,2313.3, Some sort of weird combos of genres is something that like we just don't even know yet like a more
2313.38,2321.0600000000004, What if it was more like a planet side or something like it was an MMO but it was more combat base than that would make more sense being
2321.0600000000004,2325.2200000000003, Assuragling going on quest to pick up apples so make more sense than like a world of
2325.2200000000003,2331.2200000000003, Warcraft straight up is in terms like I love to walk time again on I mean a starcraft skin on a world of work
2331.2200000000003,2338.5800000000004," Again, yeah, I could see that I mean I think that hopefully they're going to try to bust bust some genre open"
2338.5800000000004,2341.78, I would actually be a little disappointed if it was just
2342.7400000000002,2347.94, Talk to you yeah multi-artists our craft or whatever it is and almost feel like it would be a little
2349.0600000000004,2353.94, Not backwards well maybe little backwards of them to do that after wow to go back to a straight
2354.5,2358.9, RTS but they may not I mean that the whole Korea thing in some reason why I was thinking it was
2358.9,2365.1400000000003, Starcraft right well and you know it doesn't have to be even just like we're building it exactly out of that RTS model
2365.1400000000003,2367.0600000000004, It could be we're doing a real time strategy game
2367.2200000000003,2371.2200000000003, But we're completely blown the doors off how you there are five on RTS and yeah
2371.22,2376.4199999999996, You know maybe there's MMO elements where you have hero units that are in your army
2376.4199999999996,2384.98, But you've got some RPG thing that you're actually I mean there's all kinds of ways they could approach that right I think the the biggest thing that that has led to a lot of speculation and
2385.54,2390.74, And actually this morning when I was doing my you know really critical web surfing which for me is web comics
2391.2999999999997,2398.18, And I went through and looked at penny arcade one of the things that the cave and tycoe were talking about was the whole thing where they were saying you know
2398.8199999999997,2402.2599999999998, You've got to imagine somebody there in biz dev is saying well
2403.06,2410.1, Let's see one box you release it maybe an expansion or continuing stream of money right and so
2410.3399999999997,2415.06, You know that that I think has been the big push for a lot of people saying what's got to be another online game because
2415.2999999999997,2421.8599999999997," You know wow has been so hugely successful, but I really do hope it is an RTS and I think even just for that specific reason that that"
2421.8599999999997,2424.98, You know there there needs to be great single player
2425.38,2427.38, Box product and ways to play online for free
2427.7,2433.98, You know right products that come out and I everything can just go to the you must give us money to have fun right right
2433.98,2437.62, How much of an emphasis would you guess you know guessing in the keyword?
2437.62,2444.7, They would place on designing this game for specifically with a Korean audience in mind and that would and that would include both
2444.7,2445.7, You know a
2445.7,2449.78, Presentation for tournament play and stuff to just the sensibilities of a Korean gamer
2449.78,2451.78, I think that
2451.94,2454.98, Presentation for tournaments things will be really vital if it's an RTS
2454.98,2458.9, I think that's and that's been experienced firsthand and really proven out. I mean the
2459.86,2461.86, Move fact that there are
2461.86,2464.7400000000002, You know such a huge following the professional gamers that are over there
2464.7400000000002,2467.38, And I remember one time I went over and we did a signing and
2467.86,2470.1800000000003, Badness table and it was like three
2470.98,2475.7400000000002, Pro gamers in me and this is a war three event and I was the guy the least
2475.9,2481.5400000000004, They were interested in seeing and there was hundreds of people lined up to get the autographs
2481.54,2485.46, These pro gamers they're bringing them presents. I mean there they're huge. There's sports stars over there
2485.46,2489.3," Yeah, and so much of that is is the television shows that are built around it in the announcers"
2490.1,2493.62, We went over there with flagship a couple of years ago to Korea
2493.7799999999997,2499.54, Went to a gaming event hand-bits off has a team that they run and so we were there checking it out and
2500.5,2504.18, There was all these fans and they're screaming for their fans definitely then the announcers come up
2504.18,2507.06, So doing a live taping and so they're showing the announcers on the screen
2507.2999999999997,2512.58," I turned like I said like why do I recognize that guy in the middle didn't he used to play like oh, yeah"
2512.58,2516.66, He was the top-terrain player and then he went into the military service for two years
2516.66,2518.1, They have mandatory military service
2518.1,2524.74, He came back out and he and he couldn't keep up anymore. Wow like they like the speed of the gameplay and new strategies of the evolved
2524.74,2526.74, And so just like in sports stars
2526.74,2532.66, He became a broadcaster so he used to be this total star player who then now brought the child's bark
2532.66,2535.54," Yeah, yeah, and so I mean, it's it's amazing"
2535.54,2538.2599999999998, So I would think that would be a huge thing they would think about is like how do we
2538.8999999999996,2541.7, Build in tools how do we make it so it's like really presentable?
2541.94,2544.5, You know with extra cameras or how did it did
2544.8999999999996,2548.58, Warcraft three have some presentation issues next to starcraft
2549.22,2551.22, Like I heard that that the one was more
2552.2599999999998,2554.66, Sort of viable for the way the things work with television
2554.66,2558.8999999999996, I'm not really sure if there was a television viability. I think that that starcraft though
2559.2200000000003,2562.42, Really has fit more into the dynamic of how they like to play
2562.42,2565.54, They really like fast pace lots of units
2566.02,2569.46, You know the strategies of I think War three was a little
2570.34,2574.9, Too much rock paper scissors if you got too much of one then they were like no way to be the back
2574.9,2580.42, Will with starcraft you know you do have there is some slingshot you can get if you just totally outbuild the other guy
2580.5,2583.2200000000003, Even if he has a better strategy maybe you can get a foothold so
2584.1,2586.1," You know, I think also just the fact that"
2587.06,2592.58, And I'll I'll throw out there. I just think starcraft especially with brute war is the best balanced RTS ever
2593.22,2599.62," And you know, I mean war three was great. I'm gonna be wrong but just it's just so difficult to go up against that"
2600.74,2603.22, But I think that you know if they are doing the starcraft two
2603.22,2606.02, They've obviously had a lot of time to think about what they would do to do that
2606.02,2609.38, I don't know how much do it make its sensibilities wise for the Korean gamer specifically
2609.38,2614.9, But I think presentation and things that would be would be really key in some of their design concepts or at least camera controls and things
2615.54,2618.7400000000002, Build the this whole notion of the of the
2620.1,2622.1, Spectator ship over there in Korea
2622.6600000000003,2628.6600000000003," I've never seen it I've only heard accounts like what you describe, but it's it seems so amazing it just makes me wonder if"
2628.9,2633.46, Is there so much of a cultural gap that you think that could never happen here or is it just said it just says
2633.7000000000003,2638.1, It hasn't happened here for other reasons that could be sort of mounted I think
2638.7400000000002,2641.2200000000003, one of the big reasons it happened over there is that
2641.62,2646.98, It really became ingrained into the culture of the youth there
2647.54,2651.54, Everybody goes to PC bonds and so first of all unlike in the US
2651.8599999999997,2656.18," You know, we everybody has systems at home everybody plays from home and if you're connected to people"
2656.2599999999998,2660.58," You know, maybe you're best case scenarios you're on vitrilo or you know you're on expires something"
2660.58,2665.2999999999997," It's you're talking to people and hearing that what you're playing right, but mostly it's it's a fairly solitary experience"
2665.2999999999997,2670.58, Right and your connectivity is virtual there everyone goes to these places they all hang out seeing each other
2670.9,2676.98, There's actual physical intermingling and in community that builds very differently and so as
2677.62,2683.14," You know, over the last 10 to 12 years kids have grown up playing in that it now becomes where it's a more"
2683.14,2686.74, Social and kind of like if you're playing baseball or basketball through buddies you grow up doing that
2686.74,2692.34, Then you want to you see other people do it and see how well they do and so I think that's maybe the way that it works out
2693.06,2695.06, Maybe here that would change
2695.06,2700.02, But also I just think for whatever reason gaming has become super mainstream in Asia
2700.66,2706.1," You know, crazy great example of that and so no one looks at something like oh, oh, you play video games"
2706.1,2710.5," Oh, mm-hmm, how I'm using you know, you don't really get that here there's still some"
2711.22,2716.2599999999998," Stigma I think to agree is a lot of a stick. Yeah, yeah, do you think a large part of that is because I mean the government"
2716.2599999999998,2719.22, You know the Korean government itself you know really gets behind it because it's he is
2719.7799999999997,2724.34," The benefits you know in education and just kind of getting boost me economy. Yeah, I think so"
2724.34,2729.46, I mean I think that is a big deal and it was a great that was really their leap gaming was their leap into
2730.02,2735.78," Becoming a technology force you know, and I think they were the government was really really smart about that because they looked at it and said"
2735.78,2737.78," Hey, this is super attracted to the youth"
2738.02,2743.78, What a great way to get them excited about high technology is to really push gaming and they came up with you know
2743.78,2744.82, government
2744.82,2746.82, Sponsored gaming centers where
2746.82,2751.94, Start up coming to go in and get mocap super cheap and sounds to do stuff super cheap and they really made it
2752.26,2753.3, You know a place that
2753.3,2756.18, Fostered that growth in in gaming and
2756.18,2758.66, And you know there's a lot of place where I always feel that
2758.8999999999996,2761.06, Korea is a great place to look if you want to see where
2762.02,2765.14, Online is moving because they are
2765.22,2769.94, Conceiving with new business models new concepts new ideas and it's all focused about online and
2770.2599999999998,2775.7, They were doing things in online usually about three to four years before we do it in the states
2776.18,2780.5, And it's really like the whole MMO you know like when ever quest was doing good here and they're like
2780.5,2782.8199999999997," We've got like 300,000 subscribers that's huge"
2782.9,2789.06, Millions of players playing lineage and games like that there were for some reason always discounted oh well
2789.06,2791.86, That's some weird Asian thing we don't even know what that is
2792.1800000000003,2796.34, You know and now it's like oh my god world of workcraft this you know American we have eight million players
2796.34,2797.54, You know it's like so
2797.54,2801.94, Kind of that acceptance you know is caught up and now then that thing that they've been doing for the last
2802.26,2804.26, You know two two or three years or so
2804.6600000000003,2810.1800000000003, In Asian and spawned out of Korea again is that concept of you know games that are free to download free to play
2810.5,2813.62, And then you have you know real money transactions where you're buying things in the game
2813.62,2819.7799999999997, So you're kind of buying that next level of gameplay that you want to piece at a time and now we're starting to see that
2820.1,2823.94, Become interesting and popular in the US in Europe so and it's it's really interesting
2823.94,2829.54, That's an area that they I think they really lead in is like how do we get gamers games in the way that they want to experience right?
2830.02,2834.66, He did the Korean embrace of starcraft catch you well
2834.66,2837.7799999999997, You went anywhere with Blizzard off guard or did you guys see it coming?
2837.86,2843.0600000000004," No, we didn't see it coming out of it. No, it was and in fact that you know that was always the the funny part is it"
2843.0600000000004,2847.46, We sit around and talk like wow we could just figure out a way to get money out of Asia where they pirate everything that'd be great
2848.1000000000004,2849.38, And then
2849.38,2856.5, All of a sudden was like wow we're having a lot of people buy boxes over there and it was just actually it happened right around the time when
2857.6200000000003,2860.7400000000002, The South Korean government was making big strides towards the
2861.3,2864.34, Protection and electrical property and so they went to all these
2864.82,2869.3, Nacent game rooms and they said look if you're gonna have eight machines here and they all have a copy of a game
2869.3,2873.46, You need to buy a copy of each game and we're gonna come back and check on you so suddenly all of a sudden
2874.1800000000003,2876.1800000000003," They're really buying this game, but then"
2876.26,2884.58, The popularity of that game and the fact that they were actual versions there wasn't weird crappy spyware that was stealing people's past codes and all kinds of stuff like that
2885.38,2892.26, That level I think of security and and legitimacy then more and more people came in and it just kind of kept growing upon it
2892.34,2896.5400000000004," So yeah, I wish I could say that we had had some genius plan"
2896.5400000000004,2900.6600000000003," It's been a yeah, how we're gonna craft the Asian market, but no, I pretty much caught us, you know"
2901.2200000000003,2907.6200000000003," Gleefully flatfooted you know, I think there's probably listeners here who like when we stay say starcraft with big over in South Korea"
2907.86,2914.2200000000003, Really have no idea exactly how big it was I mean I remember stories at the time of like you guys
2914.2200000000003,2918.98, Maybe if you personally met like the heads of government of Korea. Yeah
2919.46,2924.42, I remember the the first part of that it happened to was Paul Sam's who's I think CEO now at Blizzard
2925.14,2928.54, But Paul went over there and met based like the equivalent of their vice president
2928.82,2934.22," One and I've met several government, you know people over there and it's I mean it's huge there's"
2935.06,2936.42, You go over there there's
2936.42,2941.06, Tell-lovision shows are dedicated to it strategy shows professional gaming tournament leagues
2941.22,2946.46, It is a common custom now where because the game's teen rated that when
2947.42,2953.98, A kid turns 13 years old an older sibling or we have also a friend will buy them a copy of the game
2955.26,2958.3," Korean bar misma today you are a man. Yeah, this is right"
2959.62,2965.2200000000003, Make those eggs grow strong. That's right. So go forth and and a salt it's weird
2965.2200000000003,2969.5, There's like no equivalent in this country. I don't think no there really isn't like giving me
2969.5,2971.9, Darts on TV you watch bowling on TV
2972.42,2977.38," So that's different you're not gonna get the head of the bar. Oh, no, I'm just saying I mean if you can get darts on TV"
2977.38,2979.38, I mean how long is it gonna take for we can get some
2980.02,2984.2200000000003, I don't know I'm trying to answer that what I rather watch you playing your Mary had a little lamb on your your death
2984.2200000000003,2987.2200000000003, Or whatever throw some dude throwing darts. Well
2987.5,2991.5, That's but in start draft they're not they're not playing their lutes
2992.2200000000003,2998.9," You know there yeah, it's intense. Well, and this match amazing is a great audience is a good to watch those games live are so"
2998.9,3003.02, Educated it's just like a sports match. So they absolutely know they know what's happening
3003.02,3008.46, You'll see somebody make like a really good faint or a good move or like they know they uncovered every year and you'll
3008.46,3010.46, People know
3010.46,3011.46, Everybody knows what happened
3011.86,3016.34," Yeah, that's the thing here you have to explain it would take so much work to even let people know what's going on"
3016.86,3019.7400000000002, You know like if you imagine if you put startcraft on TV here
3020.06,3023.1800000000003," Yeah, like imagine if you're some colors"
3023.18,3027.22, They do so all right Scott just built it just built a barracks. That's right
3027.22,3030.22, You like sitting up his tarant forces and he's moving him over to that second base
3030.22,3035.06," That's gonna be an important move later. Oh, he's gonna go some patrol. Oh, that's right. Yeah, and they actually have"
3035.06,3040.46," They have three guys. He do many teams at three and there's a color guy. Oh, it's a color guy. Yeah, there is and that's like the guy who was the former"
3040.46,3045.2599999999998," You know best hair player. He was the color guy talking about well, that's a great strategy because it's just wow"
3045.2599999999998,3050.8999999999996, It's it is something it's totally amazing when you go over there and see it because there's nothing like it that we've ever experienced here
3050.9,3052.6600000000003, I think they're trying to they're trying to do that kind of stuff now
3052.6600000000003,3054.88, You even if it's just online with a command of conquer three
3054.88,3059.54," They are including the battle cast, tell us straight or mode into the game. So maybe it's gonna happen"
3059.54,3062.54, Maybe in our lifetime we'll see something like that happened. Be pretty fun
3063.2200000000003,3066.7000000000003, It's still gonna end of now. We still have to wait for all the old people to die
3067.98,3073.7400000000002, We do have a rapidly changing online scape and on that note
3073.7400000000002,3078.58, That's that's the tip off to get another transition. There's you've got some news about steam
3079.14,3084.18, And about valve their plans to to basically offer more with steam
3084.7799999999997,3088.02," Well, this news kind of broke over the weekend, right?"
3088.42,3094.06, Actually if I'm on mistake and you're the one who first uncover this little gem a little little online search
3095.5,3097.5, trip to a message board
3098.22,3103.2599999999998," So actually I want to do the headoff back to you since you found it. Okay. Well, basically long story short"
3104.14,3106.38, Valve is going to continue to expand
3106.94,3111.06, Steam and with what it's been called in the story to steam community. It's basically adding
3111.86,3113.9, enhanced friends list functionality
3113.9,3119.5, The ability to you know part the equivalent of parties people are familiar with that with Xbox and Halo 2
3119.7400000000002,3123.2400000000002, Where you have a bunch of your friends together and you're like let's change server so instead of
3124.1400000000003,3128.46, A series of leap frogs where you find the server daring and I join you and then someone joins me and stuff
3128.46,3131.12, We all go out once you're able to filter for
3131.7000000000003,3134.54, This is bad news for me. You're able to filter for no-one griefers
3134.54,3136.54, You're a
3136.54,3137.54, Shuttle luck man
3137.54,3141.98, Party's over so but but I mean some of the things that that I mean here's the big thing
3141.98,3144.18, Or these are all things that you associate with live
3144.74,3152.54, So so clearly valve is stepping up anticipating games for windows live and is basically offering solutions of their own
3152.74,3155.38, as we know yes with with steam
3156.02,3160.7799999999997, Valve is more than just you know a developer their publisher if they're party games and so
3161.7400000000002,3165.82, They're basically situating themselves to say hey like do you want to put your game on library?
3165.82,3170.38, Do you want to put it on steam we have all the stuff here? It's up our users don't need to pay a
3171.3,3173.3, subscription fee or something like that so
3174.94,3178.7000000000003," Yes, we got we got bill here. I mean like you're making a game"
3179.26,3183.02, You have options you have games for windows live is a potential option
3183.26,3187.1400000000003," You have steam is not shen and then you have creating your own solution. No, right?"
3187.1400000000003,3189.1400000000003," Yeah, we chose trading our own solution"
3189.46,3191.7799999999997," There was so much easier right? Yeah, I don't know about that"
3192.02,3198.3799999999997, It was what worked though. I mean well live anywhere wasn't really even a viable option at point when we started because it wasn't out
3198.54,3201.54, Right announced it and everything so but they shouldn't you have known?
3201.54,3207.9, I mean this is something that I asked them shouldn't you have known you know well in advance of the announcement to the world at large about it
3207.9,3209.74, So that you could if they wanted to woo you
3210.22,3215.14," Courts your company in your game, you know, since you've just had been in that conversation at a"
3215.62,3218.14, In earlier date that might have been good
3219.14,3224.42," I don't know it so you know, I don't know how it also depends on when they actually thought of doing it to you know"
3224.42,3228.42, I mean and the amount of time it takes to build up that online infrastructure
3229.66,3235.7," Also a lot of the things that that we're doing with ping zero, which is actually the company that we created to do that for our game"
3236.42,3241.66, Is that is not only the things that you get with steam like distribution and patching those things
3241.66,3244.2599999999998, But we actually have to handle a lot of other things. You know
3244.82,3249.86, client server data structures databases hosting ban with I mean like you know
3249.86,3256.1800000000003, We kind of are doing this subternut solution and so for us there there were some options out there to do it
3257.0200000000004,3263.5400000000004, But it actually just came down to the fact that we thought we were gonna be the safest doing it on our own based on our own experiences
3263.86,3268.1000000000004, But I think that there's a lot of companies out there on the flip side that that don't have that
3268.1000000000004,3272.1800000000003, Wherewithall I don't have that experience and and neat solutions
3272.4199999999996,3278.8999999999996, And I think it's you know it's good that there are some you know really strong stable solutions that are that are out there that people can turn to you to say
3278.8999999999996,3283.8999999999996," You know, I really want to get my game online how do I do that because it is difficult and it's expensive to do and"
3284.18,3286.54," You know, it's not a superman or but everybody needs to be there"
3286.54,3291.98, But this does seem to be one of the big hit just to me is that when a company is of a either substantial size or
3291.98,3297.66, Substantial experience like you guys with with all of your Diablo two experience before this before how gate that
3297.66,3300.06, The incentive for you guys and
3300.2999999999997,3302.2999999999997, companies like you to want to join
3304.38,3312.2599999999998, GFW live or steam and it's just got to be less right? I mean because you're used to having the control you're used to having the
3313.14,3316.94, It is I think but it's it's also difficult because I mean there's plenty of
3317.46,3322.86, Big companies with experience that've gone online and it failed and it's not it's not easy it really isn't
3322.86,3326.86, And so I think that that is interesting and then you know for
3326.86,3332.46, Even bigger companies publishers are bigger you know any developers to look at because you have to start figuring out
3332.46,3333.98," You know, where do you put your effort somewhere?"
3333.98,3337.94," You put your dollars especially if you're the guy making a budget and if it's like hey, you know"
3337.94,3342.5, We can find a solution that is we is tested is proven
3342.5,3348.54, We know is gonna work and and you know the developers of that are going to work with us to make sure that we're getting what we need for our product
3348.94,3350.94, It's just like
3350.94,3355.02," Really, I think in the future seeing like licensing an engine from epic"
3355.02,3357.98," You know or from it you're gonna say wow, you know"
3358.46,3362.1," Yes, we could make our own graphics engine, but right here's what it does everything we want to do"
3362.1,3369.82, We can make some changes and get it exactly what we want and that's a better solution and more and more it seems as more games are available with games for just life and
3370.06,3374.62, Steam you know community functionality where you're able to do because again on steam is you're able to
3375.18,3381.38," Check your own stats, you know and insane detail look at basically everything you've done how many hours you spent playing and stuff"
3381.38,3387.06," And then when you're not able to offer those features and everyone else is you just seems that you're to disadvantage, you know"
3387.46,3389.46, So I mean
3390.26,3393.78," I guess I'm saying it seems like I mean, I'm I'm glad for it. I've been waiting for a long time"
3393.78,3395.94, I mean there are a number of features that I mean
3395.94,3401.54, I remember getting really excited when they're you know when when EA announced that there'd be voiceover IP for Battlefield 2 and
3402.1800000000003,3407.2200000000003, Getting to a point where these things are become a standard rather than a really cool treat and that's been happening
3407.2200000000003,3410.26, You know command and conquer load of the rings online all have voiceover IP
3410.7400000000002,3414.26," It's happening in different ways you know independently and stuff, but I mean it's it's"
3414.82,3420.9, Reassuring overall to see these things happening. I think right and it becomes a barrier to entry really if if
3421.3,3426.42, Someone goes online and suddenly their expectation is I'm gonna have voiceover IP and I'm gonna have stats
3426.42,3430.6600000000003, I can download and I'm gonna have this and those things become the norm even though the companies
3430.98,3434.42, That made them the norm spent years and years getting there
3434.98,3438.98, That's the other thing is then gamers start expecting that. I mean it's actually a pretty pretty tough
3439.3,3445.22," Making games now because the expectations are so high for games. Oh, I'm gonna get movie quality cinematic sequences"
3445.22,3450.18, I'm gonna have Hollywood voice acting and I'm gonna have unlimited amounts of gameplay and I'm gonna
3450.18,3455.38," You know, you know, these are ticking off this list of that's what you can't give us that series catalog anymore. It's right"
3456.66,3459.78, But that's probably why there's like this whole side market of
3460.34,3464.98," You know experience long time developers making more casual games now, right?"
3465.06,3471.3, And so might say sort of set buckle that I'm just gonna go back to my roots from 20 years ago and make this little game
3471.62,3474.82," Yeah, make things that are smaller leaner are still incredibly fun"
3475.22,3478.34," You know, and then you start figuring out different ways how do you get that to market and"
3478.7400000000002,3484.18," Okay, you could talk about mythos like you know, you know, we've kind of gone both directions"
3484.18,3487.46," You know, we've got Helgate London which is you know kind of the big bad"
3487.86,3494.7400000000002, Hopefully 800 pound gorilla that comes out and you know uses everything we've ever learned in terms of making a gigantic triple A
3494.8199999999997,3497.14, title and then mythos was kind of the
3498.02,3503.4599999999996, Originally was the test bed product for Helgate was there that uses all the technologies to you know
3503.4599999999996,3507.8599999999997, Try to smooth the path for Helgate in terms of online and engine mechanics and things
3508.02,3511.9399999999996, But really to kind of whole life of its own and and so that's
3512.4199999999996,3514.4199999999996, Kind of become like that smaller
3514.66,3521.9399999999996, You know online RPG vibe and and and they and they are really different in the way they play and really different in the the focus on
3522.5,3528.1," You know what we put into them, but it is it's really fun. I mean it's like that was I think the surprise first about mythos"
3528.1,3529.14, We were playing I'm like
3529.14,3531.7000000000003," God, this is really fun. Okay. We got to do more with this"
3531.78,3535.3, This is way too fun to just let it end up dying off as this test bed
3535.3,3538.58, So how are you gonna feel if mythos ends up being more popular than Helgate?
3538.98,3540.26, That's okay. You know
3540.7400000000002,3543.38, How are you gonna be going God damn it the free game
3543.78,3549.2200000000003, Son of what about we should have made Helgate the free one continuing to use mythos as a test bed for all other things
3549.2999999999997,3554.02," You know I mean because it seems like in that free environment you can say well, let's just try something radical"
3554.02,3558.66," You know, yeah, it's a real fun part about it. There's a different level of expectation with the right and you know"
3558.66,3561.8599999999997," Hey, here's a crazy idea. Let's try this out. Put it down there"
3562.66,3567.4599999999996, But it's really interesting. I mean just from the the people that have had a chance to be in the alpha
3568.3399999999997,3572.02, For mythos you know we had amazing feedback and to the point where you know
3572.02,3574.5, They were saying like okay you guys can't let this go away
3574.8999999999996,3576.1, This game can't disappear
3576.1,3579.46, So which is really you know good news for the guys and Seattle if they were
3580.58,3583.7, They don't really want to disappear either actually the first we heard of this game was when
3584.66,3591.46, Excuse me you participated in a roundtable we had with a whole bunch of game developers about something else and when your
3592.1,3596.8199999999997, Your piece your part of the piece came back with your name it said you know developer
3597.46,3600.5, Helgate slash mythos who we all like what the fuck is mythos?
3600.74,3604.2599999999998," He just let his new game slip no, but we hit it. Yeah, I get that cover"
3606.18,3609.2999999999997," You'll be here in about it soon. Yeah, that was for the love hate story"
3609.2999999999997,3614.74," Right, yeah, yeah, I mean that was the thing was fun about it, too. Is it you know it hasn't been the whole all right?"
3614.74,3620.3399999999997," How do we grind up the gears for kids like you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll just kind of start talking about it"
3620.3399999999997,3622.58," Yeah kind of bring people in virally, you know"
3622.9,3626.74, We've always talked about the way we kind of wanted to start spreading the word about it was almost like
3627.14,3632.18, You know like with Google mail with Gmail right it was like oh hey play hey here's some invite start telling your friends about it
3632.5,3634.98, You know seeping it out there until we got to the point where we wanted
3634.98,3641.14, You know be able to get articles about it and things and so if we see these random message board posts now about how great mythos is is
3641.38,3644.98," Can we can see with the u-bell yeah, probably we really got to try this great game out"
3645.86,3647.86, actually I've been blown away by how
3649.22,3650.42, Into it
3650.42,3653.22, I mean with relatively small amount of content that's there
3653.78,3657.06, People that were in the alphar and like on our forms for it and stuff and talk about it like
3657.06,3661.54," I'm gonna go talk about it now. Okay. Yeah, so I think about it. Yeah, so we get it"
3661.54,3665.7799999999997, Stringing borrow these emails. What is this mythos thing? How do I play in your mythos alpha?
3665.7799999999997,3667.7, It sounds like on a less labor intensive
3668.58,3669.62, scale
3669.62,3671.62, GFW podcast is our mythos
3672.34,3675.38, You know what's like we spend all this time working on the magazine and then what you like

3682.9,3687.46," Well, it's not a lot of popular, but you get a lot more feedback a lot more volume feedback yeah"

3871.46,3875.54," To decide you know what the contest should be and that was ultimately yeah, we'll get it"
3875.54,3878.98," But but so yeah, it was a reader that actually suggested the contest should be"
3880.1,3886.34," Okay, it rooklives says shouldn't the contest be come up with the contest idea and like you he said that could be kind of mad"
3886.42,3889.62, But that's that's no why no knock against it so

3961.2200000000003,3964.02," So uh, you know what I never even got GBA rules"
3965.06,3967.6200000000003, What did you think you I don't always pronounce what got bowed
3967.62,3973.7, There's got a rule that's how it goes on message boards you so used to seeing like an avatar or something and a bunch of letters
3973.7,3977.7799999999997, And you might know a few and you say it in your head like like no effects CKY we used to
3978.2599999999998,3981.62, Because we we play steam games with them sometimes and we'd always calm
3982.3399999999997,3984.3399999999997, No effects not fix Kiki right
3986.3399999999997,3993.06, Crop like that so GBA rules wanted us wanted people to create the best my space page entry for the whisky nerd
3993.06,3996.66, You created an aim for make your own horrible identity of music clips favorites
3997.7799999999997,3999.7799999999997, I got a lot of that was pretty good
3999.7799999999997,4006.18," Okay, okay, this one here's another one that I like for the response that it got not not the idea itself"
4006.2599999999998,4011.62, Okay liquid Ocajis is I've got a great idea how about we role play in this thread for it
4011.62,4015.14, I'm so good at form role playing in anime manga forms at my space
4015.7,4019.2999999999997, It's not as easy as it looks when it comes down to our pain we get our share of noobs
4019.62,4023.22, You know the people who come in write some shit and kill off your character immediately on post
4023.54,4028.02, News piss me off because I'll post up like it doesn't taste work on a character for a week
4028.02,4032.8999999999996, And look at write some stuff about they stabbed me in the back when I wasn't looking that gang to kill off a character
4032.8999999999996,4037.62, You have to engage with the person a full on battle of whits and knowledge and of the lore that you are
4037.62,4044.1, Are being about I could go on about it the skill required in role play in the underlying rules when it comes with it for example
4044.1,4048.18, If we were doing warcraft role playing obviously no one can be a Titan because that would be cheating
4048.4199999999996,4051.22, So after this guy posts this and I have to point out
4051.2999999999997,4055.22," This guy is like our whipping boy, but he was the one who complained that when I when I did the"
4055.22,4056.74, I hear the web
4056.74,4059.22, The rudo thing that I spoiled something for him
4059.7799999999997,4061.62, And it was basically a bunch of gibberish in our mind
4062.4199999999996,4066.1, So the response ninja gamer response and he underlines when
4066.74,4072.8999999999996, Liquid Ocajis says that I'm so good at form role playing in the anime manga forms at my space
4072.8999999999996,4078.4199999999996, So he highlighted role play anime manga at my space and he says this guy should win
4078.7400000000002,4083.06, It's just post where tattoo it would be the congee tribal Tasmania double trifecta
4088.58,4093.78, So he's like an asilded tramp stem so now now like well I was gonna say like
4094.5,4101.62, The guy that one is is real alive to make it like uber met us who the guy that basically decided what the contest is gonna be
4102.34,4106.42," Is about a contest about creating contest is the winner so yeah, there you go"
4109.3,4112.82," Okay, so now you only speed through two chief brief heroes"
4113.7,4119.86, Here's the where bill this kind of be embarrassing in front of Bill Robo because he doesn't know what the hell this is about but we basically
4119.86,4123.22, But it's the whole that's gonna let's go the key to our podcast can't be embarrassed
4123.78,4125.78, I'm using gaming
4125.78,4131.62," Yeah, so these guys we basically find I mean kind of that guy I could I could have been here"
4131.62,4137.46," The one you find yeah, it was like that you know and you kind of spice them up a little"
4139.38,4142.66, So actually maybe build could help out with one of them if you want to read one
4143.9400000000005,4147.46, I think it's a reading I mean all light nice. I mean this is this is the the max
4147.46,4151.7, So making fun of people nerdier than so all start when I was were police
4151.7,4155.3, We are in all hands you get mentioned I was at a Renaissance fair this badly
4156.34,4158.34, Check this shit people we got Bill
4158.9,4159.86, I
4159.86,4163.06, Chill out on the classic what we got Bill Robo this gonna read a hero the web
4163.38,4169.780000000001," Okay, so let me give you one the kitchen mother after you started. They're not on you. Okay, so spools says"
4171.780000000001,4176.34," I knew probably be attacked for this video games or for losers, etc"
4176.820000000001,4181.54, But this is exactly how I thought when they're eth died I honestly didn't know what to do
4181.9400000000005,4186.1, That's pretty much in the days or going to battle without any material equipment
4186.660000000001,4190.660000000001, Forget to heal my characters after battles completely neglecting my chocobas
4191.62,4196.74, And we just go to the golden saucer and take around for hours and hours at a time playing mini games
4197.3,4201.7, I just didn't see any point to advancing the story how could there be a story without it?

4245.78,4252.5," Yeah, it's up to you. Which one is now? You know, I think you do a disservice to the original author if you don't read it in the format presented"

4280.5,4284.74, Who gives a damn about being more social amongst those vapid ways of food and employment?
4285.38,4290.5, If you're a great way to have fun and enjoy things that are available to you in life
4290.9,4296.02," Not only this, but the making of a game is an art form by playing through say an RPG"
4296.34,4300.74, You are treated to a grand story that's just overwhelmingly more fulfilling and going out
4301.139999999999,4304.099999999999, Fucking some chick high five in yourself and calling it a night

4355.06,4358.42," Oh, he's I almost miss a cue there. Yeah, space and out"
4359.62,4362.66, Marveling that we had build away here as of the web that was that was classic
4363.38,4365.38, I think it was a hero
4366.5,4371.58," Just call them like you see some all right, so we we've put you through the yeah, ring your hair and making us listen to our idiocy"
4371.58,4373.58," Yeah, now the payoff"
4374.1,4376.1, We'll talk about you
4376.1,4378.42," It was no my idiocy sweet. Yeah, so"
4378.74,4384.86," We've previewed this game a lot of times now before we dive yes, sir right into how gay"
4384.86,4388.06," Yes, sir can we build can we ask you a few general questions sure"
4388.06,4390.06, I'd be happy to answer general question. Okay
4390.54,4393.3," Well, I just before it cuz I mean, I think once we get into hell gate"
4393.3,4398.34," I was gonna do right we'll go deep. Yeah, um, number one thing"
4398.34,4401.38, I was thinking you're talking about you know all the feedback and stuff and I just wonder
4402.34,4409.42, In light of recent events and recent trends where you have you know dentist die-ac and David Jaffee and
4410.82,4414.1," Well, see that to a different extent rather than quay to mean I've been"
4414.38,4420.1," You know interacting directly not only with their audience the people that play their games, but with people in the press"
4420.1,4422.58, You know critics and stuff too and so I'm
4423.46,4425.86, At two questions I guess you know what's your take on that
4426.82,4431.7, You know how if you've been if you've even been paying attention to it and also like how closely do you patrol
4431.7,4436.54, You know message boards for things set about you that games that you have both in development and it
4436.54,4439.219999999999, Gives that you've already that are already out that you've worked on you know
4439.219999999999,4444.5," I mean, are you basically googling you know how gaiting and seeing what what shit people have to talk or like they'll"
4444.5,4448.74," Roper and asshole yeah, well, you know those those come straight to the inbox"
4451.139999999999,4454.259999999999, You know not so much I mean we we spend a lot of time with our community
4454.74,4458.42, You know we we've got an amazing group of fan sites
4458.58,4463.18, We have fans that actually went up within the first two weeks of the company being announced
4463.74,4468.54, That's crazy which is not like flagship follower is like probably our oldest fan site and
4469.02,4470.900000000001, Now they're all geeking out like oh my god
4472.900000000001,4477.1," But they were just like you know we don't know what you guys are gonna do, but we're sure it's gonna be great"
4477.1,4481.02, And so we're making a fan site based on and it's and it's awesome
4481.02,4484.820000000001, Those guys have been great. They run forums. We were actually in those forums quite a bit
4485.5,4487.9400000000005, We do like to see what people are saying about the game
4487.9400000000005,4492.42," You know, let's from maybe ego surfing standpoint, but more just getting that you know what are expectations?"
4492.42,4497.540000000001, What are interests I think one of the things that was how that tracked really well in the development of
4497.900000000001,4500.620000000001, Helgate and even talking about it was that at the beginning
4501.540000000001,4506.780000000001, We knew that we'd have these three factions we'd have Templar and Cabalas and Hunters and but the first one we talked about was the Templar
4506.78,4508.139999999999, Because they're the easiest
4508.46,4512.36," Faction for people to understand you know, hey, it's guys with swords and shields and going in and you know"
4512.36,4514.0599999999995," Banging the crap out of monsters, so you're gonna you know"
4514.0599999999995,4518.78, That's an easy one and then we can talk about all the things that were the layers of complexity about the game
4519.259999999999,4522.86," And then people searching oh that's really great, but well, what about spellcasters?"
4522.86,4525.259999999999," That's great for melee, but we want spellcasters like oh great"
4525.259999999999,4526.78," Well, let's talk about the Cabalas next"
4526.78,4528.62, But then they got done they're like that's up
4528.62,4532.179999999999, But the game has a great first person engine. What about some FPS going?
4532.179999999999,4535.5," Oh, well good. We'll talk about the hunters next day and it just kind of worked out that way"
4535.58,4542.14, But it was really interesting to see the community tracking kind of the same thought process we had and it was a good validation of okay
4542.14,4544.7," Well, we're not nuts. These are gonna be really good things for players to get into"
4545.5,4548.86," Yeah, I don't know it's it's it's really difficult though because"
4550.3,4555.34, Fans tend to get really into the minutia of things and it's really easy to not
4555.74,4560.3," To you know, he's a horrible cliche see the forest for the trees sure and they'll come in and say oh"
4560.54,4567.66, If you guys did this or this and they're like focusing on this one just tiny little element of something to do and it's like
4567.9800000000005,4572.62," And from that our job then has developers is to take that step back and say okay, what's the what's the problem?"
4572.62,4577.18, They're trying to address what is it that they actually want not saying you should disfire ball
4577.18,4582.06," Should do two more points of damage. Yeah, like that like okay, so what are they really what are they really getting to?"
4582.06,4584.7, What's the meta that they're turning it to right and try to address that
4585.18,4588.22, And we we do tons of stuff all the time. I mean that's one of the reasons that we
4589.18,4593.42, Wouldn't especially you know in the hey day of E3 that I don't even know what you three
4593.42,4597.26," Isn't more yeah, but you know, we would always have a talk about that next"
4597.26,4599.26," Yeah, we'll have it out of war"
4599.66,4603.66, You know people will come up and play we we'd watch them play get feedback from them
4604.22,4607.18, You know doing talking with the press like every time we talk with you guys
4607.18,4611.26," It's always like okay now, so that's great story like what do you think you guys see way more games"
4611.26,4616.54, And we you know it's and getting all that constant feedback and kind of putting that in the mix is is really vital
4616.78,4621.82, So the community plays a big part in that so I think when we're out surfing the web and looking for that stuff
4621.82,4628.7, It's more you know what are people what's their feedback on articles with their feedback on if we've had you know people in for play days if they've seen it
4628.7,4633.74, It shows you know what are they feeling about that you know less than whether I'm concerned if somebody thinks them a good guy
4633.74,4640.54, On the right there's got to be a certain amount of like I mean that must be just learned behavior it is for most of us on on the net of
4641.0199999999995,4646.46, filtering out a certain level right I mean because you'd go nuts if you took every single pulse here
4646.54,4652.22," Seriously about the my new ship the gameplay like you're saying. Oh, yeah, you would you go you go totally bonkers"
4652.38,4657.82, Because everybody's really opinionated and it's great it shows passionate shows that they they love the fact that you've got the game out
4657.82,4659.82, And they they're really into it
4659.82,4663.92, But it's the same kind of thing where if you sat there and took every single post super serious
4663.92,4665.92," Yeah, yeah, you'd probably kill yourself"
4667.18,4671.5, So that that's on the the company level. Does that the same also for you on the personal level?
4671.9,4674.54," Yeah, I think the first couple years"
4675.1,4682.06, Back in the blizzard days where I started you know really kind of spokesmaning and things like that and talking and being the face of the company and and
4682.06,4684.06, I would
4684.06,4687.5, Really take things super seriously and if somebody said something like you know
4687.5,4691.42, I know this and had our bill said this and the whole thing and I would speak all oh my god
4692.3,4697.82, And after while you just realize people are just gonna say whatever they want you never gonna make everybody happy
4698.7,4701.42, You have to try your best to actually get across
4701.42,4704.54, You know what the message is make sure it's really understood
4705.42,4707.9800000000005, but you know also I think for me personally
4709.26,4711.26, You know it's
4711.66,4715.18, Definitely at blizzard and flagship is really this way. I mean it's a huge team
4715.18,4717.18, There's so many people that are important to the product
4717.18,4720.9400000000005, Porting getting it done important to the messaging and everything you know and I happen to be
4721.42,4727.42, The one who goes out and then represents that and takes that message out and so for better or for worse
4727.58,4731.9, I also realize on the flashpoint for that so if something comes out that is
4732.46,4734.9400000000005, unpopular or misunderstood or whatever
4735.18,4741.34," You know then it's you know, oh that bill roper guy and you know on the flip side of something comes out in straight"
4741.34,4744.38, It's like oh bill roper is big success and it isn't it isn't me at all
4744.46,4747.02, You know it's just that I'm the one who gets to be you know
4747.02,4748.54, I do think lucky enough to
4748.54,4755.5, Represent all this massive work that goes on with the team and and so it is really you know kind of the thing where I had to
4755.66,4762.46, To shut that off to not freak out when somebody said something is that a danger then with maybe like responding a little too too
4762.46,4765.66, Vocalier to need your to to your critics online
4765.66,4769.66, You know when you are basically speaking for an entire group of people that are working on a
4770.22,4776.38, A project that might be you know many years in the making it is and and I think the the big thing that is important is that when
4776.78,4778.78, You know the company and the team
4778.78,4782.54, Understands that so they don't get that impression. It's like oh well
4782.78,4787.26," Bill's out there taking all the credit or that kind of stuff because it's not the case, you know, but at the same time"
4787.26,4793.74, And I think it's an area where our industry is very different than then music or film and things is like you know people want
4794.54,4798.86, Again for better force they want quote unquote stars they can latch on to do want to recognize
4798.86,4804.54," Will face a persona someone they can look at and say oh hey, I either identify with that guy or I hate that guy or whatever it is"
4804.78,4810.14, And you know film has it naturally in television and authors and books and you know the front man in the band and all that kind of thing
4810.780000000001,4813.58, I think it's something that because games are such
4813.9800000000005,4818.3, Massive endeavors that take you know huge teams of people that are incredibly talented
4818.54,4823.42, We don't have so it is kind of a thing where you know if I if I go out there it's you know
4823.42,4827.18, I always try to push the fact that I'm I'm ripping the team the company if the same time
4827.18,4829.5," You know, I'm not perfect and if I say something"
4829.740000000001,4832.06," Yeah, maybe not the best or something you know"
4832.06,4836.780000000001, I get the joy of getting it both sides. So you know like if people on the fan the sides will be like oh
4837.259999999999,4840.94, I'm going to go with the absolute what did you say no? I don't think I said then
4840.94,4843.98, I don't gotta learn to master the art of like if it's something cool
4844.54,4850.139999999999," Then you take credit for it, right? But something lame than its flagship right or then all right if there's a PR"
4850.139999999999,4852.46, Person that's where I like to go
4853.5,4855.5, That's what I try to do with the magazine
4855.9,4862.3," If there's like a really good article and just be whether I run or not. Yeah, I I thought that up and I had the guys do that right"
4863.26,4865.26, Stocks a second man
4865.26,4867.5, Just got really fucked it up. Thank you Dan
4871.34,4878.9400000000005," Yes, well, okay, so why don't we why we back up? Oh, let's see how gay does now been in development for how many years sir"
4879.9800000000005,4881.9800000000005," Well, you know I guess"
4881.9800000000005,4887.26, We probably if you want to go back we probably started it I guess officially day one of the company
4887.5,4889.5, But starting it means we came up with the idea
4889.98,4896.14," Right, you know, so that the idea pre does that pre date the existence of flagship no actually"
4896.7,4897.98, the
4897.98,4907.18, day after we left Blizzard and we started flagship we met in Dave Brevix living room and it was Dave and then Eric and Max shave on myself
4907.66,4912.7, And sat around just taking around ideas for games and after a little while Dave said okay
4912.94,4914.94, This is my high level idea
4914.94,4917.66, Half life to meet still
4918.46,4923.5, You know I want a game that's got that first person shooter immersion and some FPS elements even in it
4923.5,4932.86, But I want you know leveling of an action RPG and randomization stuff and so we we kind of sat there and kicked the idea around for probably 20 or 30 minutes and our initial reaction to a
4933.26,4935.74, A big cool idea is to figure out why it's crap
4936.22,4940.78," So we would sit around and say okay, is there a reason to spat and we couldn't figure it out"
4940.78,4946.0599999999995, So we kind of just started rolling and that same meeting that was when Max came up with the idea of putting it in London
4947.02,4952.54, And he's like oh they architecture's great and he had like he's an architect by education
4952.54,4959.26, So he had all these reasons of why there'd be great game spaces there and how it looks so cool and then we kind of started talking more about the history of the city
4959.26,4961.660000000001, And so I mean that that very first day
4962.14,4965.5, I guess you know maybe that's what the accent's down so I think it's more
4967.34,4969.740000000001," Yeah, great idea was she's put it right there in the city"
4970.780000000001,4974.9400000000005," But that's kind of amazing. I mean yeah, it was the first day first day"
4974.94,4980.219999999999, I mean and it's still kind of is that game it really is I mean it really has stayed to that core
4980.78,4982.78, Day one vision somehow
4982.78,4989.259999999999, We've kept it on that path. I mean now granted the first year of the company being together and working on the game was growing the company
4989.5,4993.58," You know doing crazy things like oh, you know getting funding through a polishing deal and all that could be stuff"
4993.58,4994.62, You have to do
4994.62,4997.82, But we worked out of Tyler Thompson is one of our tech directors
4998.94,5003.339999999999, He we worked out of his house for the first year and I actually think no matter
5003.66,5008.9400000000005, What you could do when you started company you should always start that way as somebody's house like
5009.5,5013.9800000000005, Add some is fashion the cash like however you know whatever it is like even if you had the wherewithal
5014.14,5019.1, Day one to say we're gonna get this sweet office and whatever it is that you should start in a
5019.82,5026.06, She's string confined space because it's actually the crucible with which kind of that core of the company gets formed
5026.9400000000005,5029.58, And at least it sure did for us and you know
5029.58,5034.46," I mean I was like the 17th guy at Blizzard and it was that way there too, you know you by by nature"
5034.46,5039.1, You all hang out together and you're eating lunch together and you're going places and you're not sitting around and
5040.3,5044.54, Figuring out when can we arrange our schedules to have a meeting right things like that?
5044.54,5046.54, I don't know who here has been to
5046.54,5050.62, down with you and I think we were talking about that our first visits to a bioware
5051.18,5055.26, Up in Edmonton in the old days they were in the biggest piece of shit office
5055.26,5057.26," Oh, that was you"
5057.5,5061.58," I don't know if they don't care now. They you know, they sure they'd agree with you where they were right"
5062.14,5067.1, I mean it's true was like you go and they had already made balder's gate one so you go up there and you think oh
5067.1,5069.1, This is gonna be nice and you're like holy shit
5070.22,5075.820000000001, Like some I don't know that's like some third you know fourth level down a counten
5076.22,5077.9800000000005, Soffas and some you know
5078.38,5079.74, Skid Row neighborhood
5079.74,5081.74, Like did
5081.74,5083.74, Yeah
5083.74,5087.099999999999, Never like proud I'm a control through like literally cardboard boxes
5087.74,5090.219999999999, Like I had a construction like a habit trail thing a box
5090.94,5094.3, But there was something that I really was chatting about it too in a way because it was like obviously
5094.54,5098.219999999999," They're just thinking about their game here right. I'm thinking about having some cool, you know"
5098.46,5100.78, Lunchroom with you know Mahogany desk
5100.78,5105.0199999999995, So I think gave him something to fight for to get out of the Taco Bell rappers and into wherever
5105.58,5107.82, So I mean so I guess to you know
5108.219999999999,5110.219999999999, Too late short answer but
5110.219999999999,5112.86, 2003 July was when we started
5113.82,5116.38, And I kind of think of it that first year was the
5116.78,5123.66, Building the idea and the you know the core of it in early technologies and and the team starting the team and everything so
5124.78,5127.58, You know whatever that's gonna end it being it will probably be you know somewhere in that
5127.98,5130.62, Three to four year range however you want to think about it
5131.42,5132.62, Take to deal but
5132.62,5139.179999999999, You know when you're doing a big huge triple a title with on like we're saying it's almost the norm now
5140.0599999999995,5143.26, So it tracks very much to making a gigantic feature film
5143.9,5145.9, Mm-hmm
5146.3,5152.0599999999995, Which is scary that is getting awesome. I mean for your first game to I mean your first game is this company. Yeah
5152.78,5159.0199999999995," Well, it is and it's you know and obviously you know fortunately we've got a a great history and"
5159.58,5163.34," Working together and it worked in a lot of great titles and everything but yeah, it is it's the whole reset"
5163.34,5165.58," It's like hey, this is a new IP it's a new company"
5165.98,5167.0199999999995, It's you know
5167.0199999999995,5171.66, We're starting over from scratch and you look at that and saying great and so four years from now we're gonna
5172.38,5177.58," We're gonna see how that all worked out. That's a huge leap of faith. Yeah, yeah, I'm glad I didn't think about it"
5179.98,5184.139999999999, We did a different world if you all walked in that room that meeting that first day and said okay
5184.78,5190.38," What's our big idea and then I go into Pokemon MMO yeah, yeah, how that would have been parallel universe. That's right"
5191.18,5199.42," You I know you're really you know, I mean you just for you now playing will the workcraft and so clearly you're into a standard MMO thing and for me"
5199.74,5202.14, Not so much guild wars I could do
5203.18,5206.38, But the more I tried to play the straight-up in I was I find
5207.34,5209.74, At least without the chat environment talking with friends
5209.74,5213.58, You know mean the old joke is that their their chat room was but really without that going on
5213.58,5216.54, I find that there's just not enough engagement to keep me entertained
5216.9400000000005,5219.18, So specifically for me games like
5220.14,5221.18, auto assault
5221.18,5222.7, Games like hell gate
5223.099999999999,5226.54, Our appealing because they they at least promised to offer enough
5227.099999999999,5228.3," engagement, you know"
5228.3,5235.82," An interactivity so that even though you do you I am engaging in basically repetitive, you know tasks maybe I don't know I'm guessing"
5236.78,5241.3, Just the kind of kind of game it is I'm gonna have to collect five of something at some point in the game or 10 of the other
5241.3,5246.22, Kiel five of these but as long as there's more to that than hitting you know one two and three and then like
5246.62,5247.98, Taking a sip from my
5247.98,5249.98, 64 ounce mountain dude
5250.459999999999,5255.0199999999995," You know he's so dismissive man. Oh no, but so was that I mean like clearly"
5255.0199999999995,5258.7, I mean this seems like that would be one of the major benefits so not only you know taking you know
5258.7,5262.94, Half-life two and Diablo but also a little bit of I mean for for people like myself
5262.94,5266.78, I guess I mean just making a game that would appeal to that well it really is I mean you know
5266.78,5271.259999999999, That was the huge thing about a Diablo and there was always those religious arguments about whether Diablo
5271.9,5274.7, You know and then D2 were even RPGs
5275.259999999999,5277.259999999999, That was a big thing that was a big thing
5277.26,5280.860000000001, You can call that a role playing game and right and and you know
5280.860000000001,5283.820000000001, That's the kind of thing we look at too is I think we're gonna get a lot of those arguments about
5284.22,5290.9400000000005, Whether Helgateland is really an MMO or not because we don't follow the kind of classic in my mind the classic I ever quest model
5291.66,5298.62, Which is interesting because ever quest obviously wasn't the first you know MMO RPG and really wasn't even the first kind of big
5298.62,5300.14," US made him a more RPG, you know"
5300.14,5306.46, For some reason no one ever followed all to my online model people left on a more of the ever quest style of gameplay
5307.5,5312.860000000001, And and it's kind of interesting because I mean obviously we didn't set out to make a game that was like World of Warcraft
5313.1,5318.46, So the while a lot of us played enjoy it. It's not necessarily like oh that's what you know that's not the only thing
5318.46,5321.66, I mean I played tons of guild wars. I tried a lot of was saw you know
5321.9800000000005,5325.74, We all play tons of different games and I think that for us we wanted to have a game that was
5326.38,5330.9400000000005, I think you put it really well much more engaging you know it's it's not about how you know
5330.9400000000005,5335.42, How do we figure out to get people to write on a griffin for X number of minutes to extend their gameplay
5335.58,5341.58," It's like how do we get you out into the mix absolutely as fast as possible? Yeah, and hopefully the thing that remains compelling about that is the fact that"
5341.74,5346.86, You know we're constantly working on new places for you to go and go and new items and things and you know the fact that that
5347.02,5351.58, You never know what's gonna happen to me that was always the magic of the obelitude is it every time I play
5351.58,5354.78, I know I do it was gonna happen next even if I okay in the jungle
5354.78,5356.3, I know it's gonna be that tile set
5356.3,5362.62," You know, but I don't know what's gonna be there exactly or what corner I'm gonna turn and there's a framework that it was structured on which are the quests"
5363.0199999999995,5365.5, But it was always different and so we've in hell gate London
5365.66,5370.38, We've taken that concept and just blown it out the door even things that we never did in the deoblo games like having
5371.0199999999995,5374.94, Rarity the parts of the way that background spawn so
5375.58,5377.74, For example when you're playing you can have
5379.18,5384.7, An underground area that's like say the the sewers and you're in these like old Victorian sewers
5384.94,5389.5," That's there and maybe you've gone through that type of tile setting, you know dozens of times only"
5389.5,5392.22, But this time you go through now there's a great on the wall. You're like whoa
5392.7,5398.46, What's that I've never said and I can interact with it and it takes you to this other type of like mini-side dungeon and that has you know
5398.46,5400.22, Something that's special about that or we have
5400.7,5404.62, These different chance events where you'll go I'm gone through again. They're tied to the backgrounds right now
5404.62,5409.5, So there's a quest that pops up. That's not tied to the storyline. It's not a you know collection type thing or whatever
5409.5,5410.54, It's just like
5410.54,5416.3, Wow that was something that happened to me that's a rare spawn basically so these things are like random
5416.62,5421.98," Yeah, they're randomly put in some of them are are set things that can happen other ones are like links to other"
5422.0599999999995,5428.0599999999995, Random and generated areas but the the big thing is that it is at a tied that concept of rarity into even the background
5428.0599999999995,5433.099999999999, Even the place is your adventurer and have rare things that you can find the intersociate with them and I've always loved the fact that you know
5433.099999999999,5435.099999999999, We we always talk about how our monsters are
5435.66,5438.139999999999, In this combination of slot machines and pinatas
5438.379999999999,5443.9, You know you're like killing them and like that's pulling the slot machine hell and they explode and you know
5443.9,5450.94, It's you know slightly gory or Viva Pinata and they're filling out and and there's that really excitement of that
5451.0199999999995,5454.78, You know you're seeing like what's next what's next so I'm gonna get and and and you know
5454.78,5460.139999999999, Kind of I think the other danger difference is that most of the standard MMOs and where they kind of get draggy is they
5460.54,5463.339999999999, Really start becoming all about your next level
5463.66,5468.54, Especially higher on it takes longer and longer longer and you're you're tracking the level bar like okay
5468.94,5473.179999999999," Eight more bubbles. Oh, expecting you to get better when you get to that level and then since you get to that level"
5473.179999999999,5478.139999999999, And you just want to get to the next one right and the thing I love about I love about playing you know
5478.14,5483.26, The oblo and and I love about how to get learning because it does exactly the same thing is I just level at some point
5483.660000000001,5487.740000000001, Like rarely do I look down and go how close my level. I'm just playing I'm like oh cool. There's new
5487.740000000001,5493.820000000001," Wow, it's a side. I'm cool and then thing oh cool I level they get more skills or more points to put in you know"
5493.820000000001,5497.34, You know that was a big that was a big goal and and part of
5497.900000000001,5502.780000000001, World Warcraft itself back and you made it I mean when we when I wrote the very first article on it with you in fact
5502.780000000001,5506.860000000001, That was one of the bullet points and one of the big things we talked about when I was down there was said
5506.94,5511.9," Um, you that exactly what you described is what you said about wow because"
5512.46,5518.139999999999, We went down there and Tara tearing the wind and I played it scooter and we both had moments where
5519.099999999999,5524.0599999999995, You gave us enough quests to do that we were actually trying to finish the quest and we both leveled without realizing
5524.139999999999,5530.139999999999, We were about to level so and I think wow does that brilliantly really on that is a big part of its early gameplay is that
5530.62,5535.5, You've got seven eight ten quests in your quest log like oh hey cool. I level
5535.74,5539.66, Right then but the problem is that you have 30 and you're like a bunch of you
5539.66,5543.98, One of the rings on line out if you've played that yet they took that and they like quadrupled it
5544.14,5546.86, So now you've got like your quest book holds 40
5547.18,5551.34, And you've got like well over 20 right from the start. It's like kind of overwhelming
5552.38,5556.22, You know and so I mean the way we looked at it's we want people to have a lot of you know
5556.7,5562.46, Quest and we kind of break our down to story story lines specific quest things that are moving you through the world through the game
5562.94,5564.14, um
5564.14,5566.14, Because we're doing that
5566.14,5571.58," That kind of hub and instance style game. Yes, every time we adventure and we move you through the world with the storyline quest"
5572.14,5574.78, But we have tons of tons and tons of
5575.26,5579.9, Which for us are more like missions right which a lot of those things will be fallen to those like get five of these 20
5580.62,5585.18," Right, but then with the storyline quest we really try to do some really different things"
5585.18,5592.22, We've got some pretty insane stuff. We have you doing the storyline quest things that are even outside the the scope of it being
5593.34,5598.14, To some of your reason RPG like one that I've I've brought up but it's really cool is there's
5598.54,5603.82, One where I mean usually you're used to kind of leading the battle from the front or being you know on the ground and fighting and things
5603.82,5608.22, And there's one way where we actually pull you out of that and saying like what we need you to to get this
5608.78,5611.42, The squad through this area and clear this area out
5611.5,5620.06, But we need you to do it from here from a command level position and so they've brev it coded up this like little RTS in our engine and you play this really
5620.14,5627.740000000001, Simplified little about 10 to 15 minute RTS level in the middle of your RPG and you're like and it's it's not hard
5627.740000000001,5630.3, It's not like you know you have to have mad lead
5630.780000000001,5636.38, You know Korean starcraft gamers skills to play but it's really fun and you and you can completely pull you out of
5637.02,5640.54," You know the the click-click-click-click-click-click, you know, oh, I'm going in and killing more stuff"
5640.780000000001,5645.820000000001, And it's really neat. It's like having that you know having that little shot of
5646.78,5652.54, You know of ice cream on slightly ice cream but between you know you have those big meals and it's like oh
5652.54,5656.78," And now here's the little gelato. Okay, and you're like oh, oh, I'm my palettes already fresh"
5656.78,5660.78, Now you can dig back into the next major meal. It's really fun how that works out
5661.179999999999,5665.259999999999, one thing I heard about tabular us and I wonder if this is true for your game as well is that
5666.38,5672.38, There's the equivalent of like an aim assist thing where you have a very large it would be like just taking the crosshair and really expanding them
5672.46,5675.34," So that it's more accessible, but if you choose to do a pinpoint style"
5676.62,5680.9400000000005, Which would of course mean is an option then you do more damage that way
5681.58,5688.3, Actually the way um so it really depends the the hunter classes are the ones that are most applicable with that really the marksman really
5688.46,5691.42, Specifically and actually what we do is we
5692.46,5696.46, Start you with kind of a wider area of effect so when you're starting in that class
5696.62,5701.26, But then depending on what skills you're choosing the more point you put in that skill like the smaller and smaller
5701.5,5703.5, We make that so it's more
5703.5,5708.06, Senate around just like that pinpoint shot from that and there's different things that you get from that
5708.06,5713.9800000000005," So it depends on what skills you're taking like more damage, but our chance for a critical hit different types of effects that you get"
5714.46,5719.74, But we do have it be where if if you want that FPS mechanic basically that's the way you're tuning
5720.14,5722.14, Your character in that class
5722.14,5725.02, But some in Elf's could play a marksman that maybe is more of a
5725.1,5729.34," Generalist and so they're getting that bigger zone of effect, but they're not anywhere near as"
5729.900000000001,5734.780000000001, You know like that sniper guy in the back. It has an exact FPS mechanic. Very cool and it's and it's that kind of thing
5734.780000000001,5736.780000000001, It is a is a difficult tossup on how do we
5738.22,5743.740000000001, If you FPS gameplay almost it is overlay but keep it in action RPG your level matters just right
5743.740000000001,5745.900000000001, I mean people were were were had a hard time
5746.38,5752.46, Characterizing Diablo as an RPG and what's the rule like if it takes if it takes dexterity
5752.54,5757.58," It's not an RPG yeah, I think people like to put things in boxes"
5757.82,5764.22, They like to create you know oh in my mind this is what an RPG is this is what an RTS is this is what a whatever is that kind of
5764.62,5768.46, Emerged around you know fabled in my mind was definitely an RPG and
5769.34,5773.58, The purist that we're saying it was now look at the types of games by which they meant RPG
5773.58,5778.46, You know clearly the Japanese school and stuff so think of you know a file fanciness to me those are just like
5779.26,5785.1, Like character leveling games and there's not you know really playing the role. I mean you don't I mean I probably feel much more
5786.3,5791.58, I feel you know about a stronger connection to the character that developed in a fable or something that I would
5791.58,5797.74," One of my party members in the vinyl fantasy that I'm just loving up so yeah, I think these are just semantic arguments right"
5797.74,5802.78," Yeah, I mean that the big argument about Diablo at the time was from so-called purist was"
5803.18,5808.06," Well, you're not making any moral decisions with Diablo right you're just clicking on things and killing them"
5808.46,5811.9, So if you compare it to you know an old ultima game or whatever
5812.06,5818.7, You're not you're not in dialogue trees making choices about you know how to behave or not the way biore does and what it claims
5819.1,5823.58, But that makes sense with the western tradition of RPGs because I mean there's not like
5824.14,5827.82, But who's to say that that's the one definition of a role-playing game
5827.9800000000005,5836.62, I mean what Diablo dig was was it it took you know the combat mechanics of a role-playing game and the leveling up the the point distribution and and and said
5836.7,5842.0199999999995," Okay, this is this is the game we're making and in fact you guys in a commout and say here is our role-playing game"
5842.0199999999995,5847.66, Diablo too you just or Diablo you just mean the game right and then people started labeling it and that's the thing we've always done
5847.66,5849.9, We're just like let's just make a cool game and then
5850.78,5853.0199999999995, I think sometimes that's the vein of the marketing group
5853.0199999999995,5858.54," Yep, yeah, so what are our bullet points for like I don't know man play the game and you what do you think the bullet points"
5859.18,5863.34," And with D2 it actually like you know didn't didn't create it, but I think"
5863.66,5868.9400000000005, Maybe codified the whole action RPG right because we had to have something to put on the box right
5868.9400000000005,5871.18, What's the you know what I just want to ask you this?
5871.18,5875.9400000000005, I'm not asking people this because I just heard this trim the other day and I want to you know it a USP is
5876.82,5881.78, USP don't this is a good thing that you don't this means you're not yet a complete marketing
5881.78,5883.78, Do we have no ideas
5883.78,5890.34," selling point oh God yeah, I was at it. I was at demo last week and the PR person there"
5890.34,5896.1, I'm not gonna name it names was getting annoyed because the the designer who was talking to the developer was not
5896.34,5902.06, Was not fixating on the US piece like can you see another US piece tell me US pays unique selling
5904.82,5906.66, Because because big companies DTLAs
5908.26,5910.26, acronyms
5913.06,5918.58," Well, I was gonna ask what's the most ridiculous shit that marketing's ever put on one of the boxes of your games"
5919.14,5924.1," Or not necessarily the box, but some way shape or form attached to the cell sheet or something like that"
5924.1,5929.38," Yeah, you know fortunately we've always been very involved with the marketing groups and we we maintain that at flagship"
5929.38,5933.62, So we we don't get too much of that or they just like we're gonna throw crazy stuff on there
5934.9,5936.9, He's dodging no
5936.9,5938.66, Not actually I'm trying to think of one
5938.66,5944.38," I mean there was things that were like that were screwups that used to drive us crazy. Yeah, on the original warcraft box on the back"
5945.02,5949.14, There was a screenshot that got taken from a really early build and all the trees are purple
5949.54,5954.38," Oh, wow, and we were like what the hell is that like and then we can play and like told Martin"
5954.38,5957.02," No, no, no, not you have it and for some reason that"
5957.34,5962.18, screenshot like file would just never get deleted and was always like and so we're doing like you know
5962.74,5966.54, The warcraft to battle chest. I mean get the sheets look at it
5966.54,5969.74," I'm like no, don't put this shit on the purple trees"
5970.0599999999995,5972.38, Like eight years old now. How are you doing?
5973.58,5977.34, We used to get crazy stuff like that. What's really funny? I think are the things that that
5978.7,5984.82," Our feedback is like oh, yeah, no way and hell because you you'll get some things like that where it comes in you're like oh, yeah"
5984.82,5988.139999999999, That's that's not good probably the biggest one that leaps the mind was
5989.5,5991.5, when we did we worked with
5993.66,5999.7, Nintendo on starcraft 64 right so the way from the sea a little bit right and so we're going and doing
5999.74,6004.3, That and they sent us the first ad campaign back and we've done so much starcraft creative
6004.3,6006.54, And there's all these great images and cinematics
6006.54,6010.62, We just gave them everything here's everything right and so what ends up happening
6011.34,6013.34, Was the
6014.139999999999,6017.98, element of they sent us the first ad and it's uncle Sam
6018.7,6023.98, Like doing that that classic uncle say poster right it was like we want you and it was like you know to join the star
6023.98,6027.34, Whatever and they've just taken uncle Sam made him green and put a third eye in it
6030.7,6036.7, And they and they went we were working on this like the first thing was like it was early July and so I literally said email back going like
6037.0199999999995,6041.58," Ha, that's really funny. I get it. It's almost July fourth like I thought it was a dry joke"
6042.38,6044.38, So you guys don't like it. I'm like
6044.78,6046.78, No
6046.78,6051.5," This is back at the day there was some busted ads back. Oh, those are like those are the glory days of crap ads"
6051.9,6055.0199999999995," Yeah, so I mean fortunately I thought I do that fortunately"
6055.0199999999995,6059.5, We've always been involved in that and I think the thing that's great about that is the marketing groups and work with
6059.82,6062.7, Recognize the fact that we're gamers and so they talked us like going okay
6063.42,6067.66, As a gamer is just gonna resonate with you right and and then if we go like no
6067.66,6069.66, We're gonna look at that and think that's stupid
6070.46,6075.42, Right to their credit they listen and don't try to force some horrific ad down our throat
6076.62,6077.9, Yeah
6077.9,6083.26," After you're talking about why you're talking I brought up that because we keep doing this. Hey. Yeah, that's like us bill"
6083.66,6089.34, So they're in the news issue of computer gaming. I'll let's a house ad for this very podcast
6089.9800000000005,6095.1, Which page and we didn't really down on one knee holding out as I
6096.3,6101.02, Shubby as I pot into the like you know out out of the frame in such a way that you see him
6101.02,6102.7, I just want to put that thing in his face
6102.7,6108.3," Yeah, this is the case where the marketing folks made the ad and didn't and you know we didn't make the ad"
6108.54,6111.66, So some people who don't listen to our own podcast who work for us?
6111.74,6113.66, The next contest is to do that
6113.66,6117.9, I add it as I know it goes and go out and public tape yourself doing that to people right
6117.9,6121.82," What is he holding up an iPod? Is I with that? Yeah, all right to do something to our podcast"
6121.82,6129.46," Yeah, they actually if they did a video of it they're holding that post some place and they actually use this like incredibly fresh line"
6129.66,6131.66, Tune in and drop out
6132.38,6133.66," Yeah, we did"
6133.66,6135.66, We did a favorite life
6135.66,6136.94, The best part of the right
6136.94,6143.74," Okay, so so when we were we were making this when we were making this when we knew what they were gonna make a house ad and they actually to be honest"
6143.74,6147.0199999999995," We had the option to doing it ourselves, but I like was like nah, you guys do it"
6147.0199999999995,6153.419999999999, We got to make the magazine or so and I trusted them and this is what we get so but I gave them my help
6153.419999999999,6155.419999999999, It'll listen
6155.419999999999,6162.379999999999," Okay, they listen they want to make that damn ad you're right. They want to make one up selling so I sent them an email with like"
6162.38,6168.78, 2000 quotes or so of like reader responses to our podcast and they are like oh you guys are so fucking great or whatever
6168.78,6173.26, They are like good responses and bad and tell my she'd you would you have your mom hang on or fridge
6174.14,6177.9800000000005," Right, I didn't tell them like use these ones. These are the best"
6177.9800000000005,6183.5, I just gave him a whole bunch of them. I just felt like cutting pacing from forums and the one like the ones they picked are like
6183.74,6187.18, What do you mean that give me the one so that the one first one is okay?
6187.74,6189.5," The first one's okay, but the second one is a"
6189.74,6194.38, Cudos on a very entertaining podcast and a first fuck who does you
6204.46,6206.46, You and your podcast
6207.42,6209.42, Kiddos on a very good opinion
6211.42,6213.42, I mean fuck you to the guy who said
6213.42,6214.22, I mean I mean I
6214.22,6216.22, Fuck you to the person we thought that that
6217.58,6222.3, I thought it was on a very entertaining podcast and I look forward to my next long drive
6222.54,6225.740000000001, Which will give me a chance to listen to the two most recent podcast
6227.34,6229.34, How dry is that so dry
6229.66,6232.22, It's all specific. I imagine now I'm actually
6232.22,6234.860000000001, I'm done the same Diego and I'm looking forward to
6235.58,6239.66, Couldn't they pick something a little more dynamic than the agency that sound like an ad for a movie?
6239.66,6241.02, I asked to make a
6241.740000000001,6248.38, I estimate dropping a seven ounce do so over the course of an hour and 45 minutes and expect the podcast to entertain me throughout
6248.860000000001,6250.860000000001," Okay, I'd need to do rail this entire thing"
6251.740000000001,6256.14," Yeah, I built a question in our talking about us again. Okay, so we're going I like the third one though"
6256.3,6259.740000000001, Especially the beginning of it. I don't even really play PC games anymore
6260.3,6262.3, This is still one of my favorite
6262.3,6265.34, That's gonna be good. Go show to be holy irrelevant to my lifestyle
6266.3,6271.58," Yeah, now we do kind of like that we like that that people who don't play PC games because we want like what if like Bill"
6271.58,6276.22, What if someone told you they don't even have a PC and they buy hell gate you're not gonna tell them they're dumb
6276.78,6280.06," You know, I guess I would buy some more"
6280.46,6282.46, I know right
6284.46,6286.78, They don't even need to be able to use it
6286.78,6288.78, The
6289.98,6296.7," Man you man, yeah, I don't know that I saw the cover the box from across here and I said I must have they like that they like the demons on the box"
6296.7,6299.74, Like the rubber action figure that comes in the super deluxe edition
6300.94,6304.219999999999," So the point of that was marketing people. Yeah, so"
6305.42,6311.099999999999," We love that back. Yeah, I know actually, but very directly that's what we actually have our own marketing person"
6311.18,6318.9400000000005, Aha because they know because Trisha you know Trisha's are great PR marketing director and because she knows and she's been
6318.9400000000005,6324.860000000001," Ingaming for many many. Yes, and so she's great to sit there and filters out 95% of it before we ever see it"
6324.860000000001,6330.38, Allot of marketing people both on the press side and the and the game side are people who
6330.9400000000005,6333.9800000000005, You know that that their career has always been marketing not games
6334.22,6338.06, So they might have actually been selling candy like literally that is the case in some
6338.54,6343.34," Some cases they come from the candy bar world or whatever, so it's just a product to them. That's not their fault"
6343.660000000001,6345.660000000001," No, but marketing and development should come together"
6346.06,6348.06, They shouldn't be like you know these
6349.26,6354.38, Rams battering warms to figure out who's right right well everyone's in a while in my long career here at
6355.1,6361.660000000001, C.W.U.G.F.W. I'll meet some new marketing person and I'll have a meeting with them and now like so is your magazine
6362.54,6364.54, Do you guys cover like
6364.54,6366.06, Mario games
6366.14,6369.18," I'm like oh fuck man, this is the person selling our magazine"
6370.38,6373.26, And you've been selling it for the past six months. No wonder there's no ads
6374.22,6376.22, Shit
6376.22,6381.34, I'm mad about that very fast they're all brilliant. That's why that's why we're not complaining about the fools
6381.34,6383.02, That don't even have a PC
6383.02,6386.54, Big set. You know and I would imagine that that voice wouldn't go over so well and trying to sell that
6387.34,6389.34, You're like advertising our magazine
6390.3,6392.3, It's really me sir. I have a great ad
6395.02,6397.02," All right, so let's get it back on"
6398.3,6400.3, The magic of podcasts
6400.7,6410.06, Just let it die on that amazing note we could you know we haven't done because we've been we've been pretty nice to build we haven't done any hard-bought questions like we usually do on this podcast like
6410.46,6414.38, Like the classic question is so how awesome is your game gonna be
6414.62,6419.5," Well, you know the we actually"
6420.46,6421.82, All right
6421.82,6427.82, Secret that I'm gonna divulge and this is a kind of a dirty thing but as you know and only because my overlord is here in the room
6427.82,6436.06," Right, we have a distribution deal with EA right and and part of that is that we actually have to reach a metawesome of 88 or more"
6436.9400000000005,6439.66, You know no for him to get his bonus
6439.66,6441.66, Oh
6442.54,6444.54, Now we're gonna have to
6448.54,6454.66," We're okay, is it Joe a joke no total joke. I just get I just like actually I like the fact that that"
6455.98,6460.139999999999, EA does care enough to actually like worry about what kind of ratings their games
6461.099999999999,6463.98," You know, but that's the awesome this thing is really funny. I mean"
6464.86,6467.66, To attempt to answer that question somewhat I'm just kidding
6468.62,6473.66," That was a damn good way to feel that question though. That was yeah, that was some good stuff right there"
6477.099999999999,6479.099999999999," Hellagate awesome no, I think it oh"
6480.38,6481.98, There's our line hellagate
6482.7,6484.7, Right that's for when we review it
6487.26,6494.0599999999995," But no, I I was I mean we've been pouring everything we have into this game for almost you know coming up on four years now and"
6495.02,6501.34, It's it's actually to the point where you know and I think I've we've had this feedback
6501.34,6506.860000000001, And you actually care about your characters at this point and it's a real drag when you're playing and then you're done
6506.860000000001,6508.06, you're like
6508.06,6510.9400000000005," What no, I want to start no, I want to make my guy"
6510.9400000000005,6517.1, You know you start caring about what you're doing and to me that's always a huge sign of the game is really on the right track when when
6517.34,6521.18, Internally people who know better get mad because they're doing a character web
6521.42,6525.02," Deep right yeah, that's actually like when I was playing a last one was over there office"
6525.02,6527.9800000000005, Something can I keep this character early? I just been a couple hours playing and I
6528.3,6531.66, But do you feel like after after all these years now that if something
6532.3,6537.820000000001, Is not or was not working in the game at this point that you would have you are or the other principles would have a clear
6537.820000000001,6543.26, Nuffusion like to be able to go as a group or or as individuals to be able to go like
6543.66,6548.3, Actually that kind of sucks and if you found something like that we better yeah
6548.3,6550.780000000001," No, I do I mean, yeah, I think that's the great thing is that"
6551.18,6553.58, You know almost everybody at the company
6554.06,6562.14, If done everybody our gamers and we all play games constantly all the time and we are our own harshest critics right and so if something in the game sucks
6562.780000000001,6567.860000000001, We better be the first ones that you were I noticed that and tell each other and you know you have to be fairly
6567.860000000001,6569.5, Eagolous to have that happen
6569.5,6574.54, So if somebody else comes up and maybe this was your baby in your brain storm and if somebody else in the you know the company comes up
6574.54,6578.42, Especially if it's more than one person because it says you did I do really sucks
6578.42,6583.38, That is bad we can't have that in there that you can't then sit there and go but I love that idea
6583.38,6588.22, You know you have to be able to let it go. That's got to be pretty hard to do right and it can be yeah
6588.22,6591.62, There have to be anecdotes of times when they haven't been able to let go
6592.58,6595.66," Yeah, there's definitely times where I mean one of my favorites"
6596.78,6600.58, Favorite way I think a lot of times it's your pitch so you pitch it and
6601.3,6604.86, There was a time I'll use a Diablo two story because the first one popped in my head
6604.86,6606.86, um
6607.0199999999995,6609.0199999999995, Dave Brevick wanted to have
6609.42,6614.94, This this map that would have come of there was very classic RPG map when you'd like oh when you'd hit tab
6615.179999999999,6618.86," Right, it would oh here's the map the dungeon until I try and out looks great everything and"
6619.58,6623.9, And Alan ad ham used to be at Blizzard accounts out Alan said he goes oh no
6623.9,6627.9, We should it should be like an overlay and so this was discussion about should it be like old school
6627.9,6632.46," Actually and at one point Alan said well, okay, look the question if you actually have this do you want like"
6632.78,6636.299999999999, crappy old school piece of shit like like
6636.299999999999,6639.7, Like map think of it you want the cool new dark forces style
6639.94,6643.259999999999, Start forces it just come out right dark forces style of map like
6643.74,6645.74," Well, I guess when you put it that way"
6646.7,6652.78," I guess the cool new dark sources, you know, so it was very funny like there'll be and it's because"
6653.099999999999,6656.0599999999995, There's that respect that's built in where you know that when you know
6656.06,6658.820000000001," So he's good that points like okay, let me see like in ham and further"
6658.820000000001,6663.900000000001, But I mean all those things have have happened over the years and it's it is really funny to see that where sometimes
6663.900000000001,6666.580000000001," You will have somebody's like oh, oh, this is gonna be the greatest thing ever"
6666.580000000001,6671.860000000001, I think fortunately for us in the way that we handle development and this what we always call our organic development process is
6671.860000000001,6674.06, It for us the big test is when it goes in the game and
6674.860000000001,6678.88, If it's you we consider round on hypothesized whether it's gonna be fun is it gonna be cool
6678.88,6684.22, I think it's gonna be a great idea get it in the game and start playing it and suddenly you will know whether it's any good or not
6684.22,6687.5, And we've had things that have been planned out and it's gonna be awesome
6687.5,6691.02, Then it you know we spent a couple of three weeks building it and you get it early prototype in the game
6691.02,6694.06, Like wow that really blows that's terrible
6694.06,6696.06, They get that the hell out
6696.06,6699.26," So you know, but on the other side we've put stuff in and we're saying like you know"
6699.26,6703.18," Oh, yeah, I hope maybe this will be a good idea and you put in and it really you know"
6703.18,6705.34, It blossoms and flowers and it's amazing
6705.740000000001,6709.02, And of course sometimes they do make it through and then
6709.9800000000005,6715.34, The community cries and the winds and cries and then something happens or or maybe they don't but something I mean
6715.34,6716.9400000000005, The nature of Emma most especially
6716.9400000000005,6721.18, I mean recently you're seeing radical changes in Vanguard and a number of other games where
6722.06,6728.02," You know, I know but the biggest example that was probably Star Wars galaxies that had a total reboot right after players were completely"
6728.02,6730.22, We're coming on bright of course in the reboot guts
6730.780000000001,6735.18," Yeah, that worked out really well for them. Yeah, well, you know that is the promise of online games"
6735.26,6741.740000000001, It's something we're looking forward to it being able to do continuing content for Hellgate is that you start getting that feedback from your players and even if it's things that aren't wrong
6741.740000000001,6746.62," With they're like wow, this is really cool. I want more of that is that you can then you can address that"
6746.62,6750.700000000001, You can they don't have to wait around for a year or 18 months or whatever to get you know
6750.9400000000005,6754.9400000000005," Oh, well, we put it in an expansion pack here it is that you can always be you know working with them"
6754.9400000000005,6759.26, And if something comes out it's not quite balanced right because balance of the RPG is a bitch right you know
6759.26,6762.700000000001, Real-time strategy games are actually much easier to balance because it's
6763.0199999999995,6768.179999999999," Exit you know, it's a rock paper scissors like times or it's you know, it's just the balancing is easier right in our PG"
6768.179999999999,6771.66, You have no idea what people are gonna do in crazy situations like wow
6771.66,6776.38, We never thought what would happen if they used that skill with that armor with that weapon in this stage
6776.38,6779.9," And you're like oh God and suddenly, you know somebody who comes up with the instant win"
6779.9,6784.38, Build and you have to figure out how you deal with that or you some item you think is great
6784.38,6788.38, You realize money making scheme right. Yeah. I mean there's so many different things that that can happen
6788.38,6791.62, So having the ability to have that game online to constantly
6791.62,6796.42, You know watch your player based and talk with them in tweak things and tune and change and whatever needs to happen
6796.66,6800.74, You know I think is kind of a a godsend for developers because
6801.22,6805.42, You know as long as the game is popular and people want to do it they'll they'll show you what doesn't work and
6806.14,6808.14, And shockingly they're vocal about it
6808.78,6814.86, You know and the thing that's great about an online game is especially the client server game is you can keep tons of stats in the server
6814.86,6819.099999999999, And so even if you can't see everything live time because you only have so many developers
6819.22,6825.42, You can go back and start calling for that data and saying like why is nobody playing this character class or why is nobody using this spell?
6825.740000000001,6829.620000000001," You know what why what's the reason like you know, Jesus like 2% of our players"
6830.14,6837.18, You know choose kind of this bill that's out there and see you're able to work with that and then that allows you to either
6838.1,6842.02, Analyze that and make change on your own or if you need to ask directly ask the community
6842.02,6844.660000000001," Say hey, how come nobody is playing this character class?"
6845.02,6848.46," Yeah, that's like amazing feedback for you guys. Yeah, it is it's fantastic"
6848.46,6852.66," A luxury right I really it's the old school. Oh, yeah, compared to like put it in the box ship it"
6852.66,6855.22, And then you know crush your fingers and pretty god that it does all right
6855.22,6860.18," I mean what you still do anyway, right, but you know now you've got a chance where if it gets out there and there's things"
6860.18,6864.9800000000005, You can address right away. You can do that and I think there was something we always tried to do in the past
6864.9800000000005,6872.46, But certainly it's very different when you can have the ability to devote a live team on to a product all the time as opposed to
6872.58,6875.94, You know your shipping the game and then you've kind of got to be moving on to the next thing
6875.94,6877.94, The expansion or whatever it is
6877.94,6881.379999999999," I think you're right though, too that like I mean so much of it to me"
6881.379999999999,6886.74, It just makes sense it like at the company at the game company or at you hire gamers right?
6886.74,6889.099999999999, I mean to me that was us always such a no brainer
6889.099999999999,6893.419999999999, And I wrote about that about Blizzard years and years ago and I think as critics
6893.74,6898.74, That's one of the things that constantly blows our mind with when a game is is bad like really bad
6898.74,6905.5," You know, and that's always the first thing that we always say to each other and often in the review was like did nobody at this company play this game"
6905.5,6907.3, Right like you can't believe it
6907.3,6911.3, Probably they build it. They ship it and they're like and then people come out and they're like you can't even do this
6911.3,6915.42," And it's unplayable and sometimes like yeah, didn't anybody sit there and yeah, actually"
6915.66,6918.3, You know drive the car before they all put their parts into it
6918.3,6923.16, You put it on the show floor and right and then in case that's why we always have you know
6923.16,6925.98, The games always up and running everybody can play it all the time
6926.38,6930.7," You know, I mean we work really close to our publishing partners like we're like you guys can play it all the time"
6930.7,6933.98, We love feedback tell us what you think about what I want to play it
6933.98,6937.78, I was just thinking what's missing is like is interview I haven't played the game
6938.78,6942.879999999999, So I wouldn't know what Jeff you brought the hard questions. I'm like what how I have a
6942.879999999999,6944.879999999999, You're playing the game
6944.879999999999,6952.299999999999, I need to play the game. Let me ask you this you you have it up and running everybody's playing every week banging on is it possible
6953.139999999999,6955.9, That there's this like massive like
6955.9,6960.099999999999, Cool-a drink and going on and in fact the game is gonna suck
6960.660000000001,6964.54," Uh, Ritter make a hard question. I just refered out"
6967.1,6969.84, I just want to know personal puff in this
6971.84,6979.5, The series question behind that is I wonder if it's actually possible that that not necessarily you but any game company could actually collectively believe
6979.860000000001,6982.660000000001, I'll be telling themselves this and everybody being off base
6982.660000000001,6987.26, But he's never worried you know we might be wrong. I think that's possible
6987.780000000001,6990.76, I want to hope that's possible based on some games
6991.38,6995.26, Movies albums I bought right you know some films you watch you're like well
6995.26,6999.22, They have like 140 people working at film and nobody sat around with like Frank this is shit
6999.22,7004.9400000000005, Like I hope he's ever done that you have to imagine happens right so I do think that that is a part of it
7004.9400000000005,7007.38, You know where you're like going like this is the coolest thing
7007.38,7010.58, It's like in a boogie night when they're just studio and he's recording his soul
7010.58,7015.34," Like this just cool, you know engineers are going like okay"
7015.34,7020.78," Well, I I happen to get it on to tape that's my job right right like everybody else like I'll just the greatest thing ever"
7020.78,7023.5, See you have to imagine it happens. I think
7024.5,7031.0599999999995, For us we are extremely harsh critics yeah and of our own stuff the worst more than anybody
7031.0599999999995,7033.22, And so I think that we're
7033.78,7038.2, Hopefully saved from that because you know not a day goes by we're even things that are in the game that
7038.36,7041.599999999999," Cuns of people have played outside of the company, you know they talk about wow"
7041.599999999999,7046.12, This is so fun and it's great. We still constantly look at and go. Is that really is that really any good?
7046.12,7053.2, You know there was a there was an element in the game that we had somebody come in and play and they were just like going off about that
7053.2,7056.5199999999995," Go and that is the coolest thing I've ever seen in the game blah, blah, I'm like well"
7056.5199999999995,7059.679999999999, It's really cool to hear because Eric who's our lead designer hates it
7060.5199999999995,7063.92, But everybody else loves it and it's the kind of thing where like a hill constantly bring it up
7063.92,7068.4800000000005," It's like okay, should that really still be in the game and we're like dude everybody loves it. Yeah"
7068.4800000000005,7071.36, It's got you got to leave it in so I mean we always look at that
7071.36,7077.12," So yeah, I really hope that when the game could sell people don't sit around and and the first question getting the form is like"
7077.12,7080.56," Okay, whatever drugs you guys want it. It's good. Where do I buy it?"
7081.2,7083.64, Soon as soon as Jeff soon as you said coolado
7083.64,7087.84, I saw the transparent saw saw the wheels spinning in your head. You're like hell gate
7088.4800000000005,7090.4800000000005, This gate
7090.4800000000005,7092.4800000000005, Cool
7092.4800000000005,7094.4800000000005, Your own mind
7095.12,7097.12, Purple jumpsuit sneakers
7097.6,7101.360000000001," All right, how we do it and we've been here for a long time. This is not like seven hours. This is the making bell"
7101.360000000001,7105.28, Same making cast now. Is it how long's it been is like after so long?
7105.28,7107.68, First order we've got a promo to cut oh
7108.08,7110.08," We do have a problematic cut. Yeah, okay"
7110.64,7115.2, Bill you've been an incredibly good support. Thank you. I've just been a lot of fun. Thank you. It was great to have you here
7115.44,7119.24, I'm pretty sure I missed a like a border director's meeting actually awesome
7119.24,7122.5599999999995, Maybe that's gonna be the meeting. It would say decide this game. Axie sucks
7128.24,7132.72, We're changing directions. It's not an RPG. It's not in London. Fuck London. It's awesome
7132.72,7136.0, We're gonna release it on game tap. It's only quarters. You're gonna put in and it's
7137.2,7139.2, We have a great new us p for this
