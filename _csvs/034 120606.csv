0.0,10.16," Hello and welcome once again to the GFW radio podcast this is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of games for Windows"
10.16,18.28, the official magazine this is our official podcast and it's officially December 6th.
18.28,19.28, How did this?
19.28,23.28," Yeah, I think your wife heard you not get the date right you've been troubled."
23.28,25.28, I know I think because I would be.
25.28,26.28, I'm sorry.
26.28,27.28, I don't know what date is.
27.28,28.28, But we're not our anniversary.
28.28,29.84, I need to let this out right now.
29.84,30.84, I'm so freaking tired.
30.84,31.840000000000003, We're all tired.
31.840000000000003,36.120000000000005," This is going to be the most brain dead podcast ever, I think."
36.120000000000005,38.36, It might take some more.
38.36,40.6, Point reader letters to wake us up.
40.6,42.08," Yeah, well, three of us have any."
42.08,46.400000000000006," Actually, I should say who's here today or you should say who you are here today."
46.400000000000006,47.400000000000006, Okay.
47.400000000000006,48.400000000000006, Who are you?
48.400000000000006,49.400000000000006, Ryan Scott.
49.400000000000006,50.400000000000006, Ryan Scott.
50.400000000000006,55.1," Sean Elliott and I'm back from a bit on some business trips, playing Quake Wars and"
55.1,56.1, prior to that.
56.1,58.1, I thought you couldn't talk about it.
58.1,61.06," I mean, I can't go in a details, but I can, you could say you saw it."
61.06,68.46000000000001, I'm sure they just don't want me to go into some prior to the story going to press
68.46000000000001,69.46000000000001, to print.
69.46000000000001,73.46000000000001, I'm tongue tied and got my turrets weird.
73.46000000000001,74.46000000000001, It's tired too.
74.46000000000001,75.46000000000001," Yeah, it's tired."
75.46000000000001,77.86," So Sean, I'm a lawyer and I'm also tired."
77.86,79.5, When do you get a bad child in the light?
79.5,80.5," 30, 30."
80.5,81.5, You were worth a win.
81.5,83.5, When do you get a bad child Elliot?
83.5,84.5, I think we could have a bad that way.
84.5,88.06," I'm just like, maybe two or something, but that's late."
88.06,89.06, Big baby.
89.06,90.06, You can't.
90.06,94.06," You can't make up the entire, we can make up the entire, but this is legit."
94.06,95.06, Yeah.
95.06,97.06," So I, so we just sit here."
97.06,98.82," No, let's launch right into the talk."
98.82,99.82," Okay, let's all right."
99.82,101.98, Let's get into the good times.
101.98,105.18," We're going to talk about, oh, I had a quote to read first."
105.18,106.18, That's right.
106.18,107.18, That's where we're going to start.
107.18,108.18, We're going to play a little game.
108.18,111.26," Yeah, now I'm going to start with this quote from a game developer."
111.26,115.9," And then we're going to see if you guys can get, if anyone out there can guess what game"
115.9,116.9, we're referring to.
116.9,118.9," Okay, here we go."
118.9,119.9, Quote.
119.9,125.14, I'm sorry that we have disappointed so many people on a certain project.
125.14,128.58, Please realize we did what we felt was best.
128.58,131.78, But the cards that were dealt to us in the situation we were in.
131.78,135.42000000000002, We have learned from the experience and we won't make the same mistakes twice.
135.42000000000002,139.14000000000001, The companies we dealt with were professional in every way and we enjoyed working with
139.14000000000001,140.58, them while we did.
140.58,143.46, And appreciated the opportunity to be presented to us.
143.46,147.02, You won't hear anything about our next game and tools almost on the shelves.
147.02,150.58," You lying, lying, liar."
150.58,153.34, So that's a sad quote.
153.34,155.34," Who read, who said was someone felt real bad."
155.34,156.34, What's that about?
156.34,157.34, First and second.
157.34,158.34, They felt real bad about their game.
158.34,160.34, What are they weeping over?
160.34,161.34, Should we just say?
161.34,164.02," That's how we'd wait till they enter the podcast, you know, the draw it out in like"
164.02,165.02, so smooth.
165.02,166.02, That's fine.
166.02,167.02, That's good.
167.02,168.02," People go like, oh, what is it?"
168.02,169.02, Right.
169.02,170.02," Remember, we'll remember."
170.02,171.02, We'll remember.
171.02,172.02, We'll remember.
172.02,173.02, Okay.
173.02,174.02, We'll do it next time.
174.02,175.74," And if you don't care about the rest of us, you can just hit your fast forward"
175.74,176.74, button.
176.74,177.74, Yeah.
177.74,178.74, Fized it.
178.74,179.74, Who said it?
179.74,180.74, But it is significant.
180.74,182.98000000000002," That's the fun part, I guess, because you're never going to guess."
182.98000000000002,189.10000000000002, And it could have a very significant impact on a game that you were hoping to be playing
189.10000000000002,190.10000000000002, sometimes soon.
190.10000000000002,193.10000000000002, And your life is general true.
193.10000000000002,194.10000000000002, Mm-hmm.
194.10000000000002,195.10000000000002, No.
195.10000000000002,196.10000000000002, What is it?
196.10000000000002,197.10000000000002, What could it be?
197.1,199.7, It's a little bit more abstractual from enjoying the rest of the podcast.
199.7,200.7, What do you think about it?
200.7,201.7, Yeah.
201.7,202.7, That's sure they're going to be all bug now.
202.7,203.7, They're going to be only half listening.
203.7,204.7, Which is great to say.
204.7,205.7, What does this mean?
205.7,206.7, This is going to be a shit to say.
206.7,207.7," Well, why is it?"
207.7,209.29999999999998, I've heard of this thing to get that other way.
209.29999999999998,210.85999999999999," It's like, I hate when we come on here."
210.85999999999999,216.54," And if it's a case of, we haven't played too many games recently that we could talk"
216.54,217.54, about or this for that.
217.54,218.54," But in my case, it's tough."
218.54,220.54," You know, we don't want to get on here."
220.54,222.82," Well, I play this, but I can't tell you."
222.82,223.82, But we're often the...
223.82,224.82, You'll have to read it in the magazine.
224.82,225.82, Yeah.
225.82,226.82, We're often the...
226.82,227.82, Right.
227.82,230.98," Part of being, you know, pre-use editor, whatnot, and because, you know, fewer PC games"
230.98,234.34," come out in a month, you know, on the shelves and they do a content one up."
234.34,236.78, But so many great games have been playing.
236.78,238.57999999999998, And that I'd love to talk about.
238.57999999999998,240.82, But I'm just not in position to do it here.
240.82,241.82, What can you tell me?
241.82,244.42, Can you tell anything about what you talk of Quakehorse?
244.42,245.42," Yeah, exactly."
245.42,248.14," I mean, I spent a great deal of time playing three maps."
248.14,249.14, And...
249.14,250.14, Of the fun?
250.14,251.14, Yeah.
251.14,252.14, It was completely fun.
252.14,256.14," I think it was a really good experience, too, because, instead of the usual dog and pony"
256.14,258.26," show, hey, here's this, and did you know you could do this?"
258.26,261.3," And that and the other thing, it was all about sitting down playing it."
261.3,266.09999999999997," I mean, really getting the no-the developers, Paul Wedgewood, lead designer, and just"
266.09999999999997,268.9, hatching it out over what we think make great online multiplayer games.
268.9,271.14, So you don't competitive multiplayer games.
271.14,274.18," Our history's playing these games, and then play the game, and then just sit and talk"
274.18,275.18, with them.
275.18,276.18, Here's what I'm thinking about this.
276.18,278.9," Just kind of concerns me, this is fantastic."
278.9,282.18," You know, I mean, sometimes it's as simple as just saying, hey, good going on that."
282.18,283.18, That's brilliant.
283.18,285.74," No, no other times looking at all the different possibilities."
285.74,288.78000000000003, Because there's so many dials in terms of balancing and introducing new.
288.78000000000003,291.42," Where you able to say, like, you know, but that really didn't work for me."
291.42,292.42," Yeah, I did."
292.42,296.62," I said that online three points, and it was cool because I'm hoping to, you know, I"
296.62,298.90000000000003," mean, I don't want to be so conceited that, again, it's subjective."
298.90000000000003,303.18," I mean, if there's one thing that I'm not too excited about, it could be that someone else"
303.18,306.42," is that it tickles them their fancy perfectly, you know."
306.42,310.3," But I do think, I mean, I do think it's cool to be in a position where at least there's"
310.3,311.3, some chance that...
311.3,313.3, Did you feel like you're being heard instead?
313.3,314.3," No, I'm just..."
314.3,316.18," I'm not prepared to rewrite a press release, you know."
316.18,319.82," I feel bad sometimes when I'm doing that because I feel like, what do I know?"
319.82,320.82, Right.
320.82,321.82," Like, well, I might have been telling them."
321.82,323.26," Yeah, in this case, though, it feels good."
323.26,324.26," I mean, it was a full more empowered."
324.26,327.62," I mean, partly because I've been doing this, like, I mean, I haven't been doing as long"
327.62,331.82," as you, but I feel more empowered than I did when I first started doing this."
331.82,335.5," And because that category of game, you know, Army versus Army Shooter along the lines"
335.5,337.74," of, you know, battlefield or whatnot."
337.74,341.94," Because I play that kind of game so extensively, and I do see myself as the core audience"
341.94,342.94, for that.
342.94,344.82, Very well versed in it.
344.82,348.02," And also not just myself, but in the community of players for that sort of game."
348.02,350.86, I know what things are going to be issues.
350.86,351.86," And I mean, it's great."
351.86,357.26," I felt to the point where, you know, one of my friends in the multiplayer, you know,"
357.26,358.86, community was watching one of the promo clips.
358.86,362.46, And he saw that the field operative was placing his artillery.
362.46,365.74, And he had to place apparently he had to place it in a very specific spot.
365.74,366.74, And he was bummed out.
366.74,368.1," He said, I want to be able to place this stuff anywhere."
368.1,370.98," But what kind of, like, the mice will just be there if you have to put it in a low"
370.98,371.98, box.
372.5,373.86, Look at that map right there.
373.86,379.70000000000005," And you can see that it was the GDF, the global defense forces main base."
379.70000000000005,382.82, And they also have this giant mobile command center that has to leave the gate.
382.82,385.5," And I said, if they let you put it anywhere in there, you could block the gate,"
385.5,387.70000000000005," which is exactly what, you know, him and I would do one."
387.70000000000005,389.58000000000004," You know, what were you trying to greet for some."
389.58000000000004,390.42, And so it was cool.
390.42,391.82," That, I mean, that was my hypothesis."
391.82,393.94," And I just, you know, casually mentioned that to them."
393.94,397.22," They're like, oh my god, that's exactly why you can only do it there."
397.22,399.14000000000004," But as soon as you're outside the gate, you put it anywhere."
399.14,400.14, Okay.
400.14,401.14, Yeah.
401.14,402.74," So it is completely, you know, free to do what you want with it."
402.74,403.74," But it, right."
403.74,404.74, But let me tell you.
404.74,405.74, Right.
405.74,408.58," But so I mean, those just an example of them and how quickly, I mean, how tuned"
408.58,412.5," into that sort of game you are, where you can, I guess, to with the multiplayer game,"
412.5,417.53999999999996," I mean, it makes more sense for them to solicit feedback from people like you and"
417.53999999999996,418.53999999999996," other, right."
418.53999999999996,419.53999999999996, You know.
419.53999999999996,422.02," And they're totally, I mean, they have people, they have some of the, you know, some"
422.02,426.53999999999996," of the best and most hardcore players of that category game, giving them feedback and talking"
426.53999999999996,427.53999999999996, to them.
427.54,431.34000000000003," In this case, this is the first time, you know, I, I constantly asked developers of"
431.34000000000003,432.34000000000003, this type of game.
432.34000000000003,437.14000000000004," If not only are they hiring, you know, Q&A that is not only trying to break the game or"
437.14000000000004,441.46000000000004," trying to exploit it, but people that are trying to play and they socially."
441.46000000000004,443.78000000000003, Because a lot of so many people just don't test for that.
443.78000000000003,448.42," The assumption is if, if there's an exploit, people will do it when it gives them game."
448.42,452.42," But we don't have to worry about people doing it just to be assholes or whatever, you know."
452.42,453.42, But that's not the case.
453.42,454.42, You know.
454.42,457.22," So I mean, they've actually got people testing it just for that too."
457.22,461.18," I mean, they go in and instead of trying to find ways to get out of the game, the way"
461.18,464.62," is to break it, not in and out of self with to break it for other people playing."
464.62,465.62, Right.
465.62,467.94000000000005," So that's, I mean, that's reassuring that they've got that on there."
467.94000000000005,472.70000000000005," And again, I mean, they, the, the, the, the other part of the story is that it's then delayed."
472.70000000000005,475.74, So that goes now with we do might mention later crisis is now in the late.
475.74,476.74, Yeah.
476.74,477.74, Yeah.
477.74,478.74, Team Fortress 2's been delayed.
478.74,479.74, Yeah.
479.74,484.98," All of them now are basically more or less in the same window as unreal term in 2007, sometimes"
484.98,486.38000000000005, around June or summer.
486.38,490.5," So for Quake Wars, what they said is you'll definitely, or you should definitely be playing"
490.5,491.98, it prior to the next Quake on.
491.98,492.98, Damn.
492.98,494.98, So do we not have any decent multiplayer shooters coming up?
494.98,495.98, That's not true.
495.98,496.98, It's not true.
496.98,499.26," That's why I've had played years of war on 360, you know."
499.26,503.5," And then for, you know, been playing company here as much stuff a lot on PC for multiplayer."
503.5,509.5," But yeah, I definitely wanted at least one of these games soon or rather than later."
509.5,511.02, Maybe there's something that might fill it.
511.02,515.26," I mean, now, Valve's just announced Left or Dead, which is cool."
515.26,519.7," It's kind of a cooperative, based, I mean, it's multiplayer."
519.7,523.18," It's competitive, but you work with two people or whatever in order to fight or two or"
523.18,525.9, four people in order to fight a number of infected.
525.9,526.9, Here's not a case.
526.9,529.7, I don't even know how much I should talk about this because I know if it's out.
529.7,530.7, Just say everything.
530.7,531.9," But anyway, we'll get into a later."
531.9,532.9, Yeah.
532.9,533.9, I think we'll get into a later.
533.9,537.78," How about a rainbow six Vegas, except you're not that hot on that are you?"
537.78,542.74," Well, the console version I've only played a little bit and, you know, contrary to the"
542.74,546.98," campaign and that game, which I think is supposed to be much different."
546.98,548.62, I haven't tried that.
548.62,551.9, A tactical shooter like that is really slow going.
551.9,552.9, Yeah.
552.9,558.1, And it's so much based on just the twitch ability to basically quickly and accurately put
558.1,561.78, your crosshairs on someone's head and get the first burst of shots off.
561.78,565.0600000000001," So whenever I play a game like that, I want it to be, you know, I'd rather just have"
565.0600000000001,566.0600000000001, to input be a mouse.
566.0600000000001,569.7," But then in addition, I mean, when you come off a gear's a war, something, it's just"
569.7,571.5, it's multiplayer's hideous looking to me.
571.5,574.46," I mean, some people will say it's gorgeous, but the character bottles look like the"
574.46,577.94," old, uh, 1970s, Jedi Joe dolls."
577.94,580.9," You know, just all kind of walked out and they're very exaggerated."
580.9,581.9, Gross.
581.9,583.54," Yeah, the environments are just bland."
583.54,584.54, They look like Xbox one.
584.54,585.54, Good looking Xbox one.
585.54,589.98," Yeah, I was playing gears or war last night and then those guys, what's with all the body"
589.98,590.98, types in that game?
590.98,593.82," Oh, just, you know, arms are like shoe."
593.82,594.82, Fracking tree trunks.
594.82,595.82, Yeah.
595.82,596.82, That's a steroid.
596.82,597.82, There's just some weird.
597.82,598.82, I don't know.
598.82,599.82, Shit.
599.82,600.82, Yeah.
600.82,608.3000000000001, I can't play that game when my wife is awake.
608.3000000000001,609.6600000000001," It just is like, why do you play?"
609.6600000000001,610.98, You play everything like that.
610.98,611.98, Yeah.
611.98,612.98, Yeah.
612.98,613.98, It's embarrassing.
613.98,616.34, And they walk around and nothing's happening and then let's go.
616.34,617.34, Shit.
617.34,618.34, Yeah.
618.34,621.1800000000001," Or if they're watching you play multiplayer and you spend all this time telling her, hey, we've"
621.1800000000001,622.1800000000001, got these great games.
622.1800000000001,626.86," We are a railroad magnet and doing all this stuff and she comes in and, like, there goes"
626.86,628.1800000000001, a guy getting something on the floor.
628.18,630.62, But it's spraying our cereal sprays on the screen.
630.62,632.26, And it doesn't help out your going.
632.26,633.26, Yeah.
633.26,634.26, I'm going to kill the monitor.
634.26,635.5799999999999," Yeah, and you can hear how this speaker's."
635.5799999999999,636.5799999999999, No.
636.5799999999999,639.2199999999999," Oh, hi, honey."
639.2199999999999,644.8199999999999," So yeah, especially in Burnley, that's not really."
644.8199999999999,646.02, Not that appropriate.
646.02,650.54," Yeah, I was wearing, I was wearing some t-shirt and Berkeley that some gaming"
650.54,653.78," swag t-shirt the other day because it was like green, long sleeve."
653.78,656.14, So it was warm because it's called out.
656.14,660.5," And the color of the shirt was, you know, I was like color coordinating with the flannel"
660.5,661.5, shirt I had over it.
661.5,663.06, But I took the flannel shirt off.
663.06,667.14," So I was walking around with the shirt on in downtown Berkeley and then in the back, I"
667.14,670.8199999999999," realized it was like, it said like, hands or something."
670.8199999999999,673.38," It was like some German, floor court shirt."
673.38,675.74, I'm walking around in downtown Berkeley.
675.74,678.66," You know, I just said, like, you know, Hitler rule."
678.66,681.46," Yeah, I just said, because like, oh my god, I got to go home and change."
681.46,682.46, You have to shut it up.
682.46,684.18, It had like an access tank on it.
684.26,686.78," Yeah, and it said like, you know, I'm cool or something."
686.78,690.9399999999999, I forget I'll have to remember when it was was a blatant like Nazi shred.
690.9399999999999,693.3399999999999," Well, it's a free shirt."
693.3399999999999,694.3399999999999, And that's all you're thinking.
694.3399999999999,695.3399999999999," It was like, right."
695.3399999999999,696.3399999999999, I could have this piece of shit.
696.3399999999999,697.3399999999999, I didn't even realize what it said on the back.
697.3399999999999,698.9799999999999," But then it was like, what are you wearing?"
698.9799999999999,701.9799999999999," You got to look at it if you're going to, it's rare that you get a shirt from a, you"
701.9799999999999,703.7399999999999," know, a game shirt that you want to put on your back."
703.7399999999999,707.62," But like, take a look at the front end of the back to make sure it's not it doesn't say"
707.62,709.74," every time it's just right, you know."
710.74,712.26, So a fake case.
712.26,712.58, Yeah.
714.98,717.78," I've got to stop wearing that as you'll notice, I stopped wearing."
717.78,720.86," Oh, yeah, I should mark hat just because I got and getting into many like"
720.86,722.86, conversation that didn't really want to really.
722.86,723.66, That's awkward.
723.66,726.1," Yeah, it's like because the people who recognize it as a world of work."
726.1,726.54, I've had it.
726.54,729.66," It's like, hey, I don't know what, oh, yeah, I didn't really want to talk to you."
729.66,732.54," Yeah, you know, I wore my, my world of workcraft hat, which is the"
732.54,737.5, exclamation point on that 10k run I did in San Francisco and not one person said anything.
737.5,737.86, Yeah.
737.94,739.94, But I'm taking property because your company you're keeping.
739.94,743.14, They were exactly the crossover of the running audience.
745.14,745.98, Right.
745.98,750.66," Well, the weirdest situation that involving a warcraft piece of a peril was my boyfriend"
750.66,752.42, and I read the airport going to security.
752.42,753.26, Yeah.
753.26,756.66," And we're going through and he gets pulled aside like the guys like, can you"
756.66,758.86, us make him step aside and we're a crap.
758.86,759.86, What's going on?
759.86,763.1," And then like he's like, what's server do you play all my god?"
763.1,765.66," And I just like, wow, they pulled you side to ask you this."
765.66,768.86," You pulled us out of the security line for the, that's a warcraft question."
768.86,771.06," And we're like, going, oh, did they find the gun?"
771.06,772.66," I'm like, you said."
772.66,775.4599999999999," Wow, got my belt and she's back."
775.4599999999999,777.86, Have you guys seen the World Warcraft TV commercial?
777.86,779.66," By the way, the office."
779.66,780.26, Was a conference?
780.26,781.26, Yeah.
781.26,781.86, I have.
781.86,784.86," So did they, this is going to be a super question."
784.86,788.26, Did they just like muck with office space?
788.26,788.86, Yeah.
788.86,789.4599999999999, Okay.
789.4599999999999,791.86, He was like playing Tetris in the movie and that's easy.
791.86,792.06, Okay.
792.06,793.4599999999999, I couldn't remember that exact scene.
793.4599999999999,795.4599999999999, They didn't like re-filmet with those two actors.
795.46,796.46, Yeah.
796.46,797.46, Like photo shot.
797.46,798.46, Wow.
798.46,799.46, Wild box undo his desk.
799.46,800.46, Okay.
800.46,801.46, Yeah.
801.46,802.46, On top of the monitor.
802.46,803.46, Okay.
803.46,804.46, It was funny.
804.46,805.46, It was highly laugh.
805.46,806.46, They can do that.
806.46,807.46, Yeah.
807.46,808.46, I knew it was a stupid question.
808.46,810.46, It was too much to help for to think that those guys.
810.46,811.46, Yeah.
811.46,812.46, Sure.
812.46,814.46, We'll re-filmen entire scene from the movie because we love wild so much.
814.46,819.46," I actually got close to role playing in, uh, cheers to war."
819.46,821.46, The last last week before I left.
821.46,824.46," We just decided that no, we that we were around the locust team so that we're going"
824.46,828.46," to just pretend that we were locusts and give them, give them flesh them out more than the,"
828.46,833.9000000000001," then the, but nine, uh, race of barrel carriers that they're depicted as the last cut"
833.9000000000001,834.9000000000001, scene of the game.
834.9000000000001,840.3000000000001," And so we were just talking about how, you know, we're all angry that we had to bring"
840.3000000000001,842.98," our, uh, share it hard."
842.98,846.34, But we had to bring our challenged little brothers along who tend to blow up when they
846.34,847.34, get shot.
847.34,851.94," But like mom made us, I mean, like if you played campaign, you know, there's a little"
851.94,854.0600000000001, like fiendish things that drop down to explode.
854.06,855.06, Yeah.
855.06,856.06, I know.
856.06,858.06, I guess I should have done it in the voice we were doing and it would have been funny.
858.06,861.06, But mom made us bring them along.
861.06,863.06, Locust role playing.
863.06,865.06, You must be desperate.
865.06,866.06, Yeah.
866.06,868.06, This fun.
868.06,872.06, So have we all been playing any piece of games?
872.06,877.06, Now that we have successfully avoided the watch a plane so far in the past.
877.06,881.06," That kind of similar situation is shown or like, yeah, but you can't talk about it."
881.06,882.06, Yeah.
882.06,883.06, You can't talk about it.
883.06,884.06, Yeah.
884.06,885.06, You can't talk about it.
885.06,886.06, Yeah.
886.06,889.06, You can't blow the whole reason on planet.
889.06,890.06, Right.
890.06,895.5, We'll say it is prompting a unique situation that I didn't expect.
895.5,899.5799999999999, And I wonder if other people will have the same reaction.
899.5799999999999,900.5799999999999, That is all I will say.
900.5799999999999,901.5799999999999, Great.
901.5799999999999,902.5799999999999, And that's a teaser.
902.5799999999999,904.5799999999999," See, this is where I, it's like, yeah."
904.5799999999999,905.5799999999999, Yeah.
905.5799999999999,906.5799999999999, It's like why do you even say it?
906.5799999999999,907.5799999999999, If you don't.
907.5799999999999,910.5799999999999," I'm really playing PC games, guys."
910.58,913.58, But I just can't talk about these PC games.
913.58,916.58, And then I was playing one bit of a law beta.
916.58,918.58," Burning crew said, yeah."
918.58,921.58, Which is standard and I won't skip right past that.
921.58,922.58, Yeah.
922.58,923.58, Ryan.
923.58,924.58, Eve online.
924.58,925.58, Yeah.
925.58,928.58, Like Sean standard will skip right past that.
928.58,929.58, Yeah.
929.58,930.58, True.
930.58,931.58, I'll skip it.
931.58,932.58, I do need this as a hot reader.
932.58,934.58, I do need to start getting into some of the game of the year.
934.58,935.58, We did.
935.58,937.58, That this is this important.
937.58,939.58, That's going to bring us up with your folks with you boys.
939.58,940.58, Yeah.
940.58,942.58, Because we got a few years left in 2006.
942.58,945.58," And we got to, we're going to hand out some awards."
945.58,946.58, So a few years left.
946.58,947.58, Did I what I said?
947.58,948.58, Yes.
948.58,949.58, A few years.
949.58,950.58, A few years.
950.58,951.58, Yeah.
951.58,953.58, Might as well just be stunned.
953.58,954.58," Oh, guys."
954.58,955.58, Games.
955.58,956.58, Years.
956.58,957.58, What?
957.58,961.58, So we got a few weeks left in the year.
961.58,963.58, Now we're going to pass it some awards.
963.58,964.58," And we, I don't know."
964.58,966.58, What do we think of the big candidates so far?
966.58,973.58," And the game said, you think you need to play more to, because you think it might be worthy for time to get in the award."
973.58,976.58, I think Jaws on leaches a strong contender.
976.58,978.58," Oh, good start."
978.58,979.58, Okay.
979.58,980.58, God's on here.
980.58,981.58, It was definitely on all.
981.58,982.58, God's on here.
982.58,987.58," That's one of those that I think that's probably the, you know, top contender right now."
987.58,988.58, Ryan's gonna get in the year.
988.58,992.58," You can, are you, get nightfall is, is red."
992.58,993.58, Nightfall is not came in a year.
993.58,996.58," But it's like, yeah, but even like, in company here is in multiple categories."
996.58,1001.58," It's like, yeah, in multiplayer, you know, strategy, the straight, you know,"
1001.58,1003.58, There's actually a lot of strategy games.
1003.58,1004.58, There's a lot of strategy games.
1004.58,1005.58, There's a lot of strategy games.
1005.58,1006.58, Yeah.
1006.58,1007.58, Yeah.
1007.58,1011.58," But in the Olivia and we can't, you can't, like, not take that in consideration."
1011.58,1012.58," Oh, no way."
1012.58,1017.58," And it's, you know, it's time passes and people look back on it and question, like, how much, you know,"
1017.58,1022.58," question the repetitive nature of so much of the game, you know, that they're basically a couple different dungeons."
1022.58,1028.58," There was iterations of the, of the world on the other side of the portals, you know,"
1028.58,1029.58, It's still got to be way up there.
1029.58,1031.58, But it was just an effort of it for so long.
1031.58,1036.58," And when you were playing it, when you, you know, got home and started playing that, I mean,"
1036.58,1038.58, I just completely glued into that thing.
1038.58,1039.58," Yeah, it sucked me in more of life."
1039.58,1041.58," Yeah, that was what you definitely went all games."
1041.58,1043.58, I'm going to console this year.
1043.58,1044.58, Mm-hmm.
1044.58,1045.58, For sure.
1045.58,1047.58, What else?
1047.58,1050.58," So about, about shooters."
1050.58,1051.58, Not a lot.
1051.58,1052.58, Not a lot this year.
1052.58,1053.58, No.
1053.58,1054.58, The best one I went through.
1054.58,1055.58, You got a episode one.
1055.58,1056.58, There you go.
1056.58,1057.58, You got a play.
1057.58,1058.58, And probably.
1058.58,1063.58," Yeah, it's the one I played most was prey, which certainly isn't going on my game with the list."
1063.58,1064.58, Game of the year.
1064.58,1065.58, Game of the year.
1065.58,1066.58, Game of the month.
1066.58,1068.58, Game of the last few years of the year.
1068.58,1073.58," That's, I was, you know, that was the only real full-length shooter of note this year."
1073.58,1074.58, Mm-hmm.
1074.58,1076.58, At least that's the one I saw when I was making my list.
1076.58,1077.58, Wow.
1077.58,1078.58, Really seeing you.
1078.58,1079.58, So we didn't pass out awards last year.
1079.58,1082.58," I mean, we were, if you would've asked us at the beginning of the year what the contenders"
1082.58,1083.58, will be.
1083.58,1084.58," We were, yeah."
1084.58,1088.06," We were thinking that this would be the year of, you know, the games that I mentioned earlier"
1088.06,1090.06," that were delayed, huxley, in addition to those."
1090.06,1091.06, Right.
1091.06,1092.06," So I mean, yeah, so, right."
1092.06,1095.06, So those crisis quick wars team were just right.
1095.06,1096.06," I mean, so many."
1096.06,1097.06, So they're all delayed.
1097.06,1098.06, Right.
1098.06,1100.58," So, you know, don't you think better delayed and good."
1100.58,1101.58," Oh, yeah."
1101.58,1102.58, I do.
1102.58,1104.58, Don't you think better delayed and good.
1104.58,1105.58," Oh, yeah."
1105.58,1106.58, Yeah.
1106.58,1107.58," I mean, non-delayed and sucky."
1107.58,1108.58," Well, look at that."
1108.58,1112.58, Look at all the games that we thought we'd end up on the list that kind of were crap
1112.58,1115.58, or weren't ready.
1115.58,1116.58, Mm-hmm.
1116.58,1120.58," You know, never went into a night's two was needed more work."
1120.58,1121.58, Got the three.
1121.58,1122.58," I mean, needed more work."
1122.58,1123.58, Yeah.
1123.58,1124.58, That's kind of a mantra this year.
1124.58,1125.58, That's a real world.
1125.58,1126.58, Need to be a more.
1126.58,1127.58, Yeah.
1127.58,1128.58, Yeah.
1128.58,1129.58, Darkness.
1129.58,1130.58, Right.
1130.58,1131.58, That would have been one that we'd have assumed would have been high on the list.
1131.58,1132.58, Darkness.
1132.58,1133.58, I was on our cover.
1133.58,1137.58," We're going to have to go through, you know, in a few months and go back on all our cover stories"
1137.58,1139.58, and see how many of us we would now go.
1139.58,1140.58, Wow.
1140.58,1141.58, Wow.
1141.58,1143.58, But that's not our fault.
1143.58,1145.58, Or is it?
1145.58,1146.58, Or is it?
1146.58,1148.58, Maybe it's a GFW cover curse.
1148.58,1149.58, Mad.
1149.58,1150.58, Yeah.
1150.58,1153.58," But if we cursed recently, what have we cursed?"
1153.58,1155.58," So what are the closest fights, really?"
1155.58,1158.58," You know, I mean, I'm just a bunch of you guys have been having this game in the"
1158.58,1159.58, Your thinking.
1159.58,1160.58, Your thinking.
1160.58,1161.58," Well, I was away."
1161.58,1162.58, And what are the closest?
1162.58,1164.58," I mean, I assume that, like, as always Ryan, we're going to be fighting him and"
1164.58,1165.58, the first.
1165.58,1166.58, Yeah.
1166.58,1167.58, Every year is he's like the Guild Wars Monolith.
1167.58,1171.58," It's another one of the, like, there's no MMOs if not really that came out."
1171.58,1172.58," No, there."
1172.58,1174.58," No, it's zero MMOs."
1174.58,1176.58," Well, here's what I want to know for MMO if he's here."
1176.58,1179.58," What's the call for, I mean, for some kind of special award."
1179.58,1180.58, Yeah.
1180.58,1182.58," I still think, God was always a red game."
1182.58,1183.58," It just sucked it like no, right."
1183.58,1184.58, I played it.
1184.58,1187.58," I mean, that was like, was unique for the two weeks that I played it before I was I"
1187.58,1189.58," gave up because there were no, no one else playing it."
1189.58,1190.58, There's a lot of fun.
1190.58,1191.58," Man, that is it."
1191.58,1192.58, That's games to live isn't it?
1193.58,1195.58, That must be the loneliest game ever.
1195.58,1196.58, Yeah.
1196.58,1198.58, Be like driving on the I5 at like three in the morning.
1198.58,1199.58, Yeah.
1199.58,1201.58," You know, run north of Baker's field."
1201.58,1202.58, I don't know.
1202.58,1205.58, Two donuts in the parking lot at four a.
1205.58,1207.58, And what the milk truck.
1207.58,1209.58, It's a multi player game.
1209.58,1210.58, Sure.
1210.58,1211.58, It's fun.
1211.58,1212.58, Anyone.
1212.58,1213.58, Hello.
1213.58,1214.58," Well, let's you in the back."
1214.58,1216.58, We can do some tweaking.
1216.58,1219.58," Well, here's my question about MMO the year."
1220.58,1225.58," Because does it, does it have to just be a game that came out in 2006?"
1225.58,1232.58," Because if these MMOs are like living forever, couldn't like the best MMO of the year be like the game like in that year."
1232.58,1233.58, It did like the coolest stuff.
1233.58,1235.58, Even if the game has been around for forever.
1235.58,1236.58, Could be.
1236.58,1240.58," You know, because MMOs are not necessarily notorious, but they do come in like completely"
1240.58,1243.58," change like, you know, Star Wars galaxy."
1243.58,1245.58, They've gone through three completely different iterations.
1245.58,1246.58," All the like, let me sucky."
1246.58,1247.58, Right.
1247.58,1250.58," That's saying, you know, Star Wars galaxy, that our list."
1250.58,1251.58, But we're back.
1251.58,1252.58, Now we suck more.
1252.58,1256.58," I mean, yeah, I was playing more than any other game last year easily."
1256.58,1257.58, Right.
1257.58,1259.58, And it's an interesting question.
1259.58,1262.58," Well, if we're doing that, you have to fight me on Eva online."
1262.58,1263.58, Yeah.
1263.58,1264.58, When did that go live?
1264.58,1265.58, So that was in three.
1265.58,1267.58, That's a 2003.
1267.58,1268.58, Wow.
1268.58,1269.58, I had no idea.
1269.58,1271.58, You can spin around for three years.
1271.58,1272.58, Yep.
1272.58,1273.58, Wow.
1273.58,1276.58, So some people are really leveled up from that.
1276.58,1278.58, You said you didn't have to run for three years.
1278.58,1279.58, Back.
1279.58,1280.58, Huh?
1280.58,1283.58, That's a recidivism bringing it back.
1283.58,1287.58," That was a never-gum, MMO."
1287.58,1288.58, All right.
1288.58,1289.58, Should we answer some reader mail?
1289.58,1290.58, No.
1290.58,1291.58, Okay.
1291.58,1292.58, No.
1292.58,1293.58, Do we care what they have to say?
1293.58,1294.58," Anyway, was there any news first?"
1294.58,1296.58, I'll let's hit the reader mail first.
1296.58,1297.58, Okay.
1297.58,1298.58, And then we'll go back to mixing this up.
1298.58,1299.58, I thought we're going to do some extra.
1299.58,1302.58, We need that we need to apologize to the readers for this week.
1302.58,1303.58, Do I think for this podcast?
1303.58,1304.58, We're sorry.
1305.58,1308.58, But you got to play that way.
1308.58,1311.58, It's just not in particular order that we had intended.
1311.58,1312.58, It's a little scattered.
1312.58,1313.58, We're a little tired of it.
1313.58,1315.58, It's like a Paul Jesen to do.
1315.58,1320.58," You sold the banquet TV dinner too because you made a meet the peas before the, whatever the rod and carrots."
1320.58,1322.58, That's not a matter of part of it.
1322.58,1324.58, But really don't don't.
1324.58,1325.58, Don't mix in the peas and carrots.
1325.58,1327.58," Don't you love games for Windows, though?"
1327.58,1329.58, I do.
1329.58,1330.58, That's good.
1330.58,1331.58, That's good.
1331.58,1333.58, I'm going to do that every week.
1333.58,1335.58, I'm going to throw that in.
1335.58,1338.58," That's what I thought you know, blatant product placement for a mic."
1338.58,1339.58, I'm sorry.
1339.58,1341.58, You all love it.
1341.58,1343.58," I'm sorry, Ryan."
1343.58,1347.58, You want to ask that one that we were talking about.
1347.58,1349.58," Yeah, go ahead."
1349.58,1350.58, All right.
1350.58,1351.58, Right.
1351.58,1352.58, Icarus asks.
1352.58,1353.58," Hey, GFW."
1353.58,1356.58, I'd like to hear some spin-off ideas from you guys.
1356.58,1358.58," Why do you got to make some sound like a,"
1358.58,1359.58, Like a C.A.K.
1359.58,1360.58, We have made this a smart guy.
1360.58,1362.58, I came to a third person action adventure.
1362.58,1365.58," Halo, spun, Halo Wars, Warcraft, spun off into an AMO."
1365.58,1367.58, My maddie became turn-based strategy.
1367.58,1368.58, Here was a might magic.
1368.58,1369.58, And so on and so on.
1369.58,1372.58, Do you guys have any great ideas for games or games
1372.58,1374.58, who could work well with genre switch?
1374.58,1375.58, Okay.
1375.58,1376.58, So other he wants to know.
1376.58,1377.58, Other genre.
1377.58,1378.58, Swit.
1378.58,1379.58, Other ideas we have.
1379.58,1380.58, We have.
1380.58,1383.58," Well, I've already, I'm pretty famous for this because I've done quite a few."
1383.58,1384.58, It actually in real life.
1384.58,1387.58, I've made a super bombad racing.
1387.58,1388.58, Star Wars bombad racing.
1388.58,1389.58, That was you.
1389.58,1390.58, Which is basically yeah.
1390.58,1393.58," You took, I took all of our heroes from the Star Wars universe and put them on"
1393.58,1396.58, GoCarts and put them around the slit trek.
1396.58,1398.58, You do that with the cricket that craps.
1398.58,1400.58," Yeah, I've got this."
1400.58,1402.58, Great idea.
1402.58,1407.58, Where we're going to take out life and make a miniature golf course out of it.
1407.58,1412.58, And the nightthold that takes you right in the Zan.
1412.58,1414.58," Yeah, that would be awesome."
1415.58,1419.58, And when the sucks that gets kind of up in his examples actually it had been great.
1419.58,1420.58, They've got quite well.
1420.58,1423.58," Well, who's going to argue with World of Warcraft, you know?"
1423.58,1424.58, Right.
1424.58,1426.58, And it's some other things.
1426.58,1428.58," Hey, the worst looks great."
1428.58,1429.58, We'll see.
1429.58,1430.58, I'll have seen her sort.
1430.58,1434.58," I think what looks great about is that the idea we're confident that hey, how difficult is that to pull off?"
1434.58,1435.58, But I think it's a symbol.
1435.58,1436.58," No, no, no."
1436.58,1437.58, No RTS.
1437.58,1440.58, Take take take the figures that.
1440.58,1441.58, Right.
1441.58,1443.58," I mean, it's kind of a no brainer to think that every single thing."
1443.58,1448.58," I don't just think that every single game company they have a successful game and then they just think, okay, well, what else could we do?"
1448.58,1449.58, Yeah.
1449.58,1450.58, Yeah.
1450.58,1452.58, It's like it's like the whole thing with action figures.
1452.58,1454.58, You start off with Spider-Man and you're cool with that.
1454.58,1456.58, And then like it's no more things.
1456.58,1459.58, You got Spider-Man and like the black costume and you're cool with that.
1459.58,1464.58," But then like eventually you get Spider-Man with like the gold, like mecca boots."
1464.58,1465.58, Yeah.
1465.58,1468.58, Whatever you shoot like the platinum webs or something.
1468.58,1469.58, You know what it is?
1469.58,1470.58, Samurai Spider-Man.
1470.58,1471.58, Yeah.
1471.58,1473.58," I mean, it was for us like, I don't know."
1473.58,1476.58," When I was kid-flow twisters like Star Wars, whatever."
1476.58,1477.58, It never got to.
1477.58,1482.58, It only got crazy in that you got these like ass and iron characters that didn't mean anything in the movie.
1482.58,1483.58, Like you got low-bottre something.
1483.58,1486.58, It only you and you alone know who the hell he was from.
1486.58,1487.58, Yeah.
1487.58,1490.58, That he was the guy with the banana clip backwards around his ears.
1490.58,1495.58," But then later on for subsequent generations, you know, like the he men and stuff."
1495.58,1499.58, They had to just keep taking what they had and throw him more flair onto it.
1499.58,1504.58, Like freaking TGI Friday's employee until you got like those ridiculous.
1504.58,1505.58," You're like, what?"
1505.58,1507.58, He's not even Batman at that point.
1507.58,1508.58, Right.
1508.58,1509.58, Right.
1509.58,1510.58, Like freaking Godzilla fighters.
1510.58,1512.58," But anyway, that happens."
1512.58,1513.58, That's like the Ninja Turtles.
1513.58,1514.58, Although the time is only four of them.
1514.58,1516.58," It's like, well, not what I was going to do with Ninja Turtles."
1516.58,1517.58, Another space.
1517.58,1522.58," Why aren't you just going off about how there's some new Ninja Turtles thing coming out there, Ryan?"
1522.58,1525.58, There's a new Ninja Turtles game coming.
1525.58,1526.58, Yeah.
1526.58,1529.56," Ryan discuss that with me because man, it's been a long time since there's been a"
1529.56,1531.56, good Ninja Turtles game.
1531.56,1532.56, Yeah.
1532.56,1533.56, I never.
1533.56,1539.56," I remember that our Kate, we used to ride our bicycles with the papers delivery racks on him to"
1539.56,1540.56," 7, 11."
1540.56,1544.56, Mom would give me 75 cents and get to level 14.
1544.56,1545.56, Your dad's here.
1545.56,1548.56, This is like two years ago for Ryan.
1548.56,1550.56, That's what we need to retry nuts podcast.
1550.56,1551.56, This is nothing.
1551.56,1552.56, Fuck done.
1552.56,1553.56, The secuators.
1553.56,1556.56, I had so many like I spent so much time in our kids.
1556.56,1557.56, Yeah.
1557.56,1561.56," I need to get on there and bring back the glory days of our Kate, just mess with people."
1561.56,1565.56, And I'm going to tell you once to get a silver ball arcade in Berkeley.
1565.56,1570.56," No, because I was growing up between Seattle and San Diego, not, not Berkeley."
1570.56,1574.56," But like when the best thing, 7 11, you go in, you know, you go, you go, put your"
1574.56,1578.56," quarter up, you're watching this kid play and I was probably like 14, this kid's like"
1578.56,1580.56," 7, he's eating an incense stick."
1580.56,1583.56," You know, just like a big fat incense stick."
1583.56,1584.56, And we're looking at him.
1585.56,1586.56, He's doing.
1586.56,1587.56," You eat that for, man."
1587.56,1590.56," He's like, all just casually like, speak jerky."
1590.56,1593.56, So what the hell?
1593.56,1597.56," He points us over and, you know, beef jerky comes in just toss it."
1597.56,1598.56, Lenders.
1598.56,1599.56, Yeah.
1599.56,1602.56," Well, they had the beef jerky tub, but they filled it with incense and it was like incense."
1602.56,1603.56, Three for a dollar.
1603.56,1605.56, So he got three beef jerky sticks for a buck.
1605.56,1606.56," He's like, you know what?"
1606.56,1608.56, He's like Jasmine or every bus.
1608.56,1611.56, Is it really just like beef jerky view?
1611.56,1612.56, Wow.
1612.56,1613.56," Yeah, yeah, he had not threw it out of it."
1613.56,1616.56," It was a big fat one, like a cat tail type thing."
1616.56,1619.56," Anyway, that was a rest for some of my gamers."
1619.56,1625.56," We're, we're, we're including that in the, the games for what you're watching."
1625.56,1626.56, Many detours this week.
1626.56,1629.56," He was playing a game that you can now play a game tap, which plays on your PC."
1629.56,1630.56, That runs Windows.
1630.56,1631.56, Mm.
1631.56,1634.56," You're making me, you're reminding me of my arcade is a sinking of all the weird,"
1634.56,1637.56," like psychological, sociological things about our kids."
1637.56,1638.56," Oh, yeah."
1638.56,1641.56," The way you could like always, like I used to not put my quarter up on the"
1641.56,1644.56, machine until it was clear that the guy was playing sucked.
1644.56,1647.56," So it was like the cycle of the article like, yeah, you're going to be at it."
1647.56,1648.56, Yeah.
1648.56,1649.56, I got your eye got next.
1649.56,1653.56," Other things like, I mean, was, because I would always ride like, you know, each"
1653.56,1656.56, 7 11 would have no more than three games at the max.
1656.56,1660.56," So I would ride as far away to the 7 11, hope and to find some exotic game."
1660.56,1661.56, And it would appear.
1661.56,1662.56," I remember like, yeah, kung fu."
1662.56,1664.56," Like, what is this?"
1664.56,1665.56," You know, like, I got a game."
1665.56,1669.56," And then gauntlet gauntlet came in all the local hesh from the high school,"
1669.56,1672.56," who were like, that was an age when, you know, kids with like,"
1672.56,1676.56," motley crew jackets and stuff, not motley crew, but like Aussie jackets and stuff."
1676.56,1680.56," Actually scared you, you know, they had like a denim vest with like a patch on the back."
1680.56,1684.56, But they had kicked a hole in the back of the thing and got to the switch where you
1684.56,1686.56, could insert credits in it.
1686.56,1687.56," They got it like, backed out."
1687.56,1691.56," So this one fool, this total long hair played a, like,"
1691.56,1693.56, got it for like two days straight.
1693.56,1697.56, And he was just living off of like slur piece and like bags of free foods.
1697.56,1700.56, But like I'd ride back the next morning to check on his progress.
1700.56,1702.56," Like, oh my god, man, you're on level 89."
1702.56,1704.56, That was good.
1704.56,1707.56," And then the other, the psychology thing, there's like, not only you put your quarter up,"
1707.56,1712.56," but then when you do get to play each other, there's like, where actually is the dividing line in between."
1712.56,1714.56, And are you going to buy elbows and stuff?
1714.56,1715.56, You can just have a bit of a bit of a bitch.
1715.56,1716.56, Yeah.
1716.56,1717.56," You like, kind of."
1717.56,1719.56, Just a little body language didn't let them know.
1719.56,1721.56," There's never been a really talk to the other player to say,"
1721.56,1722.56," All right, here it is."
1722.56,1724.56," Oh, yeah, now you never took a silence."
1725.56,1728.56," Or something, someone spudder something once in a while."
1728.56,1730.56, But I've ever played Mortal Kombat 3 and all of a sudden.
1730.56,1733.56," Like, I got all excited because this guy was just like,"
1733.56,1737.56," woping up everyone, you know, and just being all cheap and throwing these plain subs zero."
1737.56,1739.56," And like, I can't believe I'm meeting this."
1739.56,1742.56," It's like the cheesiest, like most of criminating thing I ever,"
1742.56,1745.56, like I deflected his freeze and froze him.
1745.56,1747.56, And then ran over to him to do an 80% combo on him.
1747.56,1750.56," But like the second second, like I reflected the freeze."
1750.56,1753.56, And I was playing Nightwolf who's like the most generic token they have.
1753.56,1755.56," American dude, Thomas Hawk."
1755.56,1757.56," I'm gonna get tribal on you, bitch."
1757.56,1761.56, And then I ran over to the 80% combo on him to kill them.
1761.56,1762.56, So good.
1762.56,1763.56, Wow.
1763.56,1767.56," Actually, I actually over over those games,"
1767.56,1769.56, we'd go to this place called Wonderland in San Diego.
1769.56,1772.56," It's like, you pay a buck 75 to get in."
1772.56,1774.56," And it's five cents, five cents to play all the games."
1774.56,1777.56, And so we'd go there to nonstop and just play finding games.
1777.56,1780.56," But one time my friend got on this big, you know,"
1780.56,1782.56, I drove us there and he got on this big win in streak.
1782.56,1784.56," And he was rubbing it in, like a total last."
1784.56,1786.56," And because we're ultra competitive, you know,"
1786.56,1788.56," and I got so mad, just left in there."
1788.56,1791.56," Like I just like, went and got in the car and drove off."
1791.56,1793.56," We were like, you know, it was like 20 miles away."
1793.56,1795.56, I'm hitting you and picking them up.
1795.56,1796.56, Wow.
1796.56,1798.56, That's a good story man.
1798.56,1799.56, I didn't talk to a friend of mine.
1799.56,1800.56, I didn't talk to a friend of mine.
1800.56,1804.56, I didn't talk to a friend of mine for like a week after he beat me up at the end of double dragon.
1804.56,1807.56," You know, after he saved a little girlfriend and you fight over."
1807.56,1808.56, Because it's all co-op.
1808.56,1810.56," And then the suddenly they like mix it up and say,"
1810.56,1811.56," All right, now it's over."
1811.56,1812.56, You take a part.
1812.56,1813.56, Turn me apart.
1813.56,1814.56," No, it was like I was upset."
1814.56,1815.56, Wow.
1815.56,1816.56, You're talking for a week.
1816.56,1817.56, Yeah.
1817.56,1819.56, Trying to bribe a bullboat to get your back.
1819.56,1822.56," I met one of my biggest,"
1822.56,1826.56, indelible memory of silverball arcade in Berkeley was when
1826.56,1827.56, those of sky.
1827.56,1831.56, This is a back when there were pinball machines and it was like the beginning of the video machine.
1831.56,1834.56, So there's like missile command and space invaders.
1834.56,1836.56, Those of sky who at the time liked older to me.
1836.56,1838.56," So he was probably like,"
1838.56,1840.56," I don't know, late 20s or something."
1840.56,1843.56, He was playing pinball and he was so frustrated with himself.
1843.56,1845.56," Wow, he was playing the game."
1845.56,1847.56, He was crying like tears.
1847.56,1850.56, And he was like yelling at the game.
1850.56,1851.56," It was like, come on."
1851.56,1852.56, Don't just fucking do.
1852.56,1853.56," God, I'm happy."
1853.56,1855.56, Like any cat playing.
1855.56,1857.56," And he's like, like, putting another quarter in it."
1857.56,1858.56," It was like, man, they're going."
1858.56,1861.56, You guys are just sharing and kid with the keyboard.
1861.56,1862.56, It's kind of like that.
1862.56,1863.56, You two video.
1863.56,1864.56, Yeah.
1864.56,1867.56," I said, I wish YouTube was was around during the arcade golden era."
1867.56,1870.56, There's good stuff.
1870.56,1873.56," Yeah, some sad stuff."
1873.56,1878.56, Like the long hair that spent two days playing gauntlet eating nothing but cheetos and slush ruffy.
1878.56,1880.56, Now you could do that to print a car.
1880.56,1881.56, You're wearing a big bite.
1881.56,1883.56, It's like porn now.
1883.56,1885.56, You don't have to be at a porn theater doing it.
1885.56,1886.56, Right.
1886.56,1887.56, It's all the kids.
1887.56,1889.56," That's what our kids are like, the porn theaters."
1889.56,1890.56, Do that.
1890.56,1891.56, Just a public.
1891.56,1892.56, Right.
1892.56,1893.56, Right.
1893.56,1895.56, People still do the DDR thing.
1895.56,1896.56, Yeah.
1896.56,1897.56," They're not like, you go there."
1897.56,1899.56," They're like, yeah, completely different."
1899.56,1900.56, Yeah.
1900.56,1901.56, That's on YouTube.
1901.56,1902.56, Yeah.
1902.56,1903.56, I'm actually anti-acid.
1903.56,1904.56, That's stuff.
1904.56,1905.56," I got to say, because I can't do it DDR."
1905.56,1906.56," It's just like, it goes with me."
1906.56,1908.56, But I think that that's a cool thing.
1908.56,1915.56," The kids can do today is to go to our kids and do that stuff where, like, actually playing it in front of other people is part of the thing."
1915.56,1916.56, Right.
1916.56,1917.56, And it's hard for kids to be.
1917.56,1919.56," It's good for your social standing, too."
1919.56,1922.56," Like, doing a river dance up in a bee voice dance."
1923.56,1925.56, People want to be you.
1925.56,1929.56, We got to take a break here.
1929.56,1931.56, We don't have a break.
1931.56,1932.56, We didn't have a break.
1932.56,1933.56," Oh, God."
1933.56,1936.56," If we take a break now, then we're going to come back and say, okay, and goodbye."
1936.56,1937.56, We're going to come back.
1937.56,1943.56, We're going to keep talking about how we've ended friendships at where video games.
1943.56,1944.56, Okay.
1944.56,1945.56, So we'll be right back.

2020.56,2021.56, Okay.
2021.56,2024.56," When we wrap it up, let's tell him who that heart quote from the beginning of the interview."
2024.56,2025.56, We're getting glad you're all right.
2025.56,2027.56," Wait, Ryan, did you want to read another one?"
2027.56,2029.56, You're looking sort of expectant like you're high.
2029.56,2030.56, Look at me.
2030.56,2031.56, Hi.
2031.56,2032.56, Got something to say.
2032.56,2034.56, Did you want to read something?
2034.56,2035.56, Yeah.
2035.56,2036.56, What?
2036.56,2037.56, Go ahead.
2037.56,2038.56, Ryan's.
2038.56,2039.56," Well, do I have a, I have one more good one."
2039.56,2040.56, I'm ready.
2040.56,2042.56, Those are King asks.
2042.56,2047.56, I hear John Carmack is more happy developing for 360 than the PC.
2047.56,2049.56, When did everything go wrong?
2049.56,2053.56," I'm hoping it's just a blogging rumor, which seems to get in the way of what's really going on."
2053.56,2054.56, Your thoughts?
2054.56,2059.56, I heard that the PS3 is 50 times more powerful than the 360.
2059.56,2065.12," So yeah, no, in other words, the dude's been, what he, we're confirming is fear that he's"
2065.12,2066.56, been reading the wrong blog.
2066.56,2072.48, So what is Ben established is that it in that division don't like all the pyrting that
2072.48,2075.56," happens on their PC games, which is fair enough."
2075.56,2076.56, Right.
2076.56,2080.56, And so they're definitely interested and also in the sales that are offered on console.
2080.56,2083.56, And they were saying doesn't like PC as a platform or anything.
2083.56,2089.92," And furthermore, one of those, not saying this to Blair about in our upcoming issue, but we recently"
2089.92,2092.7999999999997, interviewed Mr. Carmack at length.
2092.7999999999997,2099.24," And he revealed to us among other things that the lead platform for his next game, his big top"
2099.24,2102.24," secret, you know, project is PC again."
2102.24,2104.24," So, so there we have it."
2104.24,2105.24, There we have it.
2105.24,2106.24, Where do we go?
2106.24,2109.24," But he's also, I mean, Carmack's also very much into cell phone stuff."
2109.3999999999996,2112.7999999999997," You know, it's not the hates PC, but the difference there is is dramatic."
2112.7999999999997,2115.4799999999996, It's not like the difference between PC and 360.
2115.4799999999996,2119.08," The difference is him and two other people, like he used to do in the old days, can get"
2119.08,2124.0," together, make a game right in a very quick turnaround, be completely, you know, autonomous,"
2124.0,2125.56," attach to it the whole time, too."
2125.56,2129.64," You know, I mean, just there's not levels of, you know, our teams and PR and all this stuff."
2129.64,2131.4399999999996," It's just like, hey, let's make this game."
2131.4399999999996,2132.4399999999996, Let's do it.
2132.4399999999996,2133.4399999999996, It put it up.
2133.4399999999996,2137.56," And so that, I mean, that's totally understandable, but it's not, it's not the difference"
2137.56,2143.16," between I have only like the power of the PlayStation 3 or whatever the case, maybe."
2143.16,2146.7999999999997, I'm looking forward to the day when we can finally just all admit that the cell phone is not
2146.7999999999997,2147.7999999999997, a gaming platform.
2149.7999999999997,2151.48, We just stopped fricking talking about that.
2151.48,2152.7999999999997, I admitted it a while ago.
2152.7999999999997,2153.7999999999997, Yes.
2153.7999999999997,2156.7999999999997," And I'm hating that we every once in a while, somebody is if Davis."
2156.7999999999997,2159.96," So like, what do your plans for cell phone coverage in the next six months?"
2160.96,2162.4," Once again, there's zero."
2162.4,2163.08, Okay.
2163.08,2163.6, Yeah.
2163.6,2165.08," It means for Windows, Maxine."
2165.08,2165.6, Okay.
2166.6,2170.6, Not looking at what our magazine would be on cell phone.
2170.6,2171.6, Yeah.
2171.6,2172.6, Check the points.
2172.6,2173.6," Oh, yeah."
2173.6,2178.88," To see the live anywhere in a great, such an extent that you're doing some mystery at this"
2178.88,2180.68, example that Bill Gates gave it.
2180.68,2182.6, E3 was kind of cool though with that.
2182.6,2185.7599999999998," That was the first time I ever thought, okay, that's somebody using a cell phone in a cool"
2185.7599999999998,2187.04, way for a game.
2187.04,2188.04, Yeah.
2188.04,2191.6," And if you man, maybe could feed and water your pinatas from Viva Piccata."
2191.6,2193.6," Oh, you'd be doing it."
2193.6,2194.6, You don't even think about such a thing.
2194.6,2195.6, You're so right.
2195.6,2196.6, I would do it.
2196.6,2197.6, Okay.
2197.6,2199.6, So maybe we should cover cell phone games.
2199.6,2200.6, I take all that back.
2200.6,2201.6, Okay.
2201.6,2206.6," So when you play cell phone games, cell phone games, one of the growing platform."
2206.6,2208.6," It's a, it's a growth market."
2208.6,2209.6, It's a growth market.
2209.6,2210.6, A growth market.
2210.6,2212.6, We get to end on that.
2212.6,2213.6, Okay.
2213.6,2214.6," Well, and on the growth market."
2214.6,2216.6," Oh, I got to go about the quote."
2216.6,2217.6," Oh, the quote."
2217.6,2218.6, Yeah.
2218.6,2219.6, Who said that?
2219.6,2222.6, The answer to the sad and mental quote.
2223.6,2225.6, It's Bob Ross.
2225.6,2226.6, He didn't say it.
2226.6,2229.6, Bob Ross came back from the dead.
2229.6,2232.6," Well, so apologize for making the video."
2232.6,2233.6, Wait a go.
2233.6,2234.6, Shame.
2234.6,2237.6, You're right.
2237.6,2239.6, He didn't come back from the grave to say that.
2239.6,2240.6, It was his game.
2240.6,2242.6, It's the people that were making his game.
2242.6,2245.6, Bob Ross is the joy of painting.
2245.6,2248.6, The people making that game came out.
2248.6,2249.6, I think Bob and Apollo.
2249.6,2251.6," Bob, that's what words is very, obviously."
2252.6,2256.6, The whole point of what I'm doing is that painting is to teach you that painting is simple.
2256.6,2257.6, Right. That you could do it.
2257.6,2259.6, So you can get a brush and paint something and feel right.
2259.6,2261.6, So the fact that they had to cancel this game.
2261.6,2264.6," It's not going to be, we're missing the point."
2264.6,2265.6, Right.
2265.6,2267.6, This game was too hard for us to make.
2267.6,2270.6, That was no joy in our joy of painting.
2270.6,2272.6, You pretend you're painting on a game.
2272.6,2274.6, It was probably more complicated than actual paintings.
