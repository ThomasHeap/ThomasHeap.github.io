27.36,30.36, That's all come on
30.36,37.36," Sean Elliott, yes, Maxine and GFW radio people have been waiting for this they've been waiting for Sean Elliott to arrive"
37.36,41.86, They've been a lot of posts on our boards and Neo Gap that are like kids showing on one of yours
41.86,47.760000000000005, This is the most requested crossover. This is like crisis at it's over. It's so big a hang because I was just realizing as I sat down
47.760000000000005,50.760000000000005, That I haven't haven't actually listened to one up yours yet
50.76,55.76," Oh, I hope I know that had you this but you probably wouldn't sign up"
55.76,60.76, Thank God our other guest has listened to one of yours. That's true. He has and he seems to already understand it from the
60.76,68.42, Pre-Show Green Rooming that would be Mitch Gidalman from Faso studio and I am Gittleman. So we're off the road
68.42,70.94, Not special start thank for doing it. I don't really understand
72.94,77.75999999999999," You put the shell like garnet's got to miss something up. Yeah, he's wrong about something 10 seconds in this time"
77.76,80.56," That's awesome. We're on a roll. Oh, I'm a fucking anyway"
81.48,86.86, Already already pratted out by Luke to great yay. Thanks. I'm here. Shane's here
86.86,91.88000000000001, I am and for once he won't be bitching about being on deadline or anything right I'm not even a special guest anymore
93.24000000000001,97.28," Wow, he finally fucking admitted he's not a special guest. What do you know?"
98.04,103.80000000000001," Surprise shocking all so the by the way, we're supposed to tell you that the this episode has been"
104.72,106.72, Made without compromise
106.72,110.86, And just leave that for you as always as always made without compromise
110.86,115.32, So we're gonna do the regular show lines today. We have in the first segment we do in what you've been playing with the you know
115.32,118.44, Sean of course playing some PC stuff since we never cover PC
118.44,120.84, You know with Sean it's more like what you've been griefing
122.4,127.84, I play console games too though. That's something we got a clear of Shane used to be changed co-worker at EGM and it's true
127.84,130.12, I remember I like to just change jobs
130.12,132.36," No, I can't play any capital game thing anymore"
132.64000000000001,136.68, I recall assigning you amazing games such as Drake in the 99 dragons
139.0,144.4, All the favorites while he was a fucking generous guy was a pretty nice pretty nice nice in the second segment
144.4,147.92000000000002," Of course, Mitch is here for a little foster studio's little shadow run talk"
147.92000000000002,152.68, But we're also gonna parade him about whatever else they might be up to and designing games and whatever else
152.68,156.76000000000002," They're trouble we can get help to it. I'll be like in interview segment that doesn't stink. Yeah, I don't like"
156.76000000000002,158.76000000000002, I'm not already people are like oh
158.76,159.76, Doing in a
159.76,163.56, Rear skipping second segment going to news. Whatever. Skip it. Thanks
164.44,169.2, Glad I could fly down for this skip it. This is your fucking loss. I don't care anyway
169.2,171.2, We can get me fired
171.2,173.2, I bet we can actually
173.2,177.07999999999998, Thank we also have Michael Wolf over here in the corner. That's pretty cool. I mean
177.07999999999998,181.12," He's like he's the handler. Yes, well not only is he the handler, but so here's a funny story"
181.12,185.92, I got to throw in here first thing and because my very first like real interview to get into this business
185.92,190.48, In 1997 with PC gamer and all their Michael really probably doesn't remember it
190.48,193.04," Although I think he kind of said oh, I don't think you're really a risen"
193.23999999999998,196.44, So the guy the what was Matt's title at the time was he
197.07999999999998,202.64, He was publisher of it. So Matt firm had me out to interview for PC gamer in 1997 and like their interview
202.64,208.07999999999998, They could cut it down to two guys me and one other guy know I didn't get the job and and the interview was
208.27999999999997,215.04, Spend the whole day with Matt having Matt like drag you into interviews and like grill you and then take you out and give you to a person in the staff for like an hour
215.04,218.51999999999998, For them to go why the fuck is this person hanging out with me today for an hour
218.51999999999998,223.01999999999998, And I got with Michael for an hour and he was pretty much like why the fuck is this guy hanging out with me for an hour
223.01999999999998,226.48, But it was pretty cool. Didn't you not get that job because you like new too much or something
230.04,234.68," You had you heard the story, man. No, I didn't hear the story, but just the idea of Michael knowing too much"
234.68,239.72, I might have heard a garden with no too much for sure the end of the story was for the reason
239.72,244.62, The reason that they told me that I didn't get the job was because I was too enthusiastic to be taken seriously
245.04,247.04, Are you serious?
247.04,248.04, Damn
248.04,255.79999999999998," These are the attic. I don't know that seems pretty rare to hear in the enthusiast period things, so right, but I would I would like to"
256.32,259.76," The industry where we could say those sorts of things, but I don't know that one exists"
260.03999999999996,263.28," Yeah, but you got to know like 97 there was like that whole era of"
263.28,267.34, We'd be taken seriously and and we're PC gaming and a piece of games
267.34,272.8," We're serious things very serious endeavor and you should take us seriously. It's not kids play. We're not kids hobbies. We're we're. Yeah, I did"
272.8,274.8, Yeah
274.8,276.8, What do you even play in Luke?
276.8,284.56, I'm still fucking God of life. You were going to have been playing so much God of War that I did the unthinkable and actually shot Jeffy and know this week to be like
284.96000000000004,291.16," Yeah, wait, you kissed us and you kissed Jeffy. I told my liked his game. Oh wow. It's pretty awful"
291.56,292.56, Wow
292.56,299.86," Fan mail from some flounder. Yeah, but all the big like all the big news done to ask I feel about clown cars"
299.86,304.24, I felt like it'd be good to tell him when I thought of his game. That's two years old. You know what to the party now
304.24,305.74, I know why he cut his hair
305.74,310.66," Yeah, GDC's coming. He's kind of an overjazzy look. You have no you know a little bit"
311.38,317.26, Vice-aborted Jeffy white drink and have some like elephant features crafted over my simian like facade now
317.26,321.48, I'll be good to go. It's not that long past Valentine's day. He's still might be cranking out a little leave. That one time
322.22,326.32, I'm here number one fan so I haven't got the part of the game that everyone says is terrible
326.32,328.54, Which is like the spike climb when you're sitting there
328.54,330.54," Yeah, quite a few horror parts"
332.54,339.78000000000003, Climb the spike climb occurs in the context of like the template and hell version where it's you know floating platforms with red
340.3,344.98," crap beneath them. So like you can't have you went through that and then oh, but we okay"
344.98,349.92, So aside from I mean pushing crates while being beaten up on that sucks
350.08000000000004,354.66," But at the very end you get to a part supposed to be like the rad, you know, okay"
354.66,357.48," This is it, you know your fighting you're gonna fight yourself and stuff"
357.48,360.78000000000003, But there's like you're on another floating platform which totally made me laugh
360.78000000000003,368.56," I mean that was horrible and zen and half light, but like then there's like another little platform floating around like orbiting your floating platform with an archer on it"
368.56,371.56, Shooting an arrow at you as you're trying to fight yourself
371.82000000000005,373.82000000000005, It's I don't know
373.82000000000005,378.76000000000005, Play that play that shit and sit and and identify what's going on and tell me you think that's a little frustrating
378.86,382.62, Sounds like you weren't feeling it. I wasn't definitely not feeling it. What else did I play?
382.94,387.38," Oh, I got that I downloaded the agent packs for crackdown and looked at like the cobra commander scan"
387.38,392.94," You were loving that love. Yeah, yeah, the time it's there's no way the game the thing one of the things that"
392.94,397.82, Ear tastes me those that there's no way to start over like my I've had we've had green here for weeks
397.82,399.98, And weeks so my character's like totally done
399.98,404.98, Like there's nothing really I can do that and run around and try and find arms and everyone else is like this little level one
404.98,407.06, Sort of back street boy type looking care
407.06,409.74, I don't think you have to worry about it too much because what's gonna happen is pretty soon
409.74,413.12, 360's gonna like at that red ring and then it's gonna have to go back when you get it back
413.12,416.54," You get a new hard drive you can start over. Yeah, I heard about that too this week"
419.90000000000003,424.46000000000004," Real-time world at least. Oh, everyone else who knows well, but I'm just saying"
424.46000000000004,429.42, I think you don't have to worry about it. I think I'm okay. Yeah people shouldn't be surprised to see an upcoming patch where
429.66,435.14, All the bosses can get put back into the game and also like sort of a new way to create a new character on the same safe
435.3,439.18, Right another thing that you could probably not not count on but is
439.18,445.26," Pretty probable coming in the download of the pipe. Well, I think that the whole that if it's in exactly with what real-time world is all about"
445.26,448.66, I mean obviously this is like totally sandbox. They're not like focused on the on the
449.42,454.74, Incapsulated game like like a grand theft. They're very much into like here's a sandwich with fucking one to have fun
454.74,460.14," So they'll definitely do stuff like that. I think that's pretty much all I've been playing. I haven't playing. Oh, tell the us come down"
460.14,462.14, Not playing that I like it
463.34000000000003,465.34000000000003, It's crap
465.34,470.7," Wow, did you want someone to argue with you because you made my fucking for it? I just it's crap"
470.85999999999996,473.97999999999996, It's a whole internet for people that with a argue with you about that
475.97999999999996,480.97999999999996, It's no our it's no art with people every time you ask someone what's so good about this game
480.97999999999996,483.26," And they're like well, it's no art and it's like"
484.17999999999995,488.29999999999995, They give it to you like you know when you a little kid like peas is pants and all you can say is
488.29999999999995,493.88," And you like okay, that's that's supposed to say everything that's the whole end of discussion"
493.88,496.6, They go it's no I think not fucking war
496.6,498.71999999999997, I think if you were you serious about that
498.71999999999997,500.5, I think if you were to read your reviews
500.5,504.56," I mean there are the good things by the game, but yeah, it perhaps was a tad overrated by some members of"
504.56,507.0, Tad overrated like why was talking to Ryan about it?
507.0,510.2, I haven't like played enough of the game to actually defend not liking it
510.2,511.36, I just know that I don't like it
511.36,517.96, I'm not willing to like be a massacist and keep not liking it so that I can make like a particularly coaching argument as to why I don't like it
517.96,519.16, I don't know it was like well
519.16,523.64, There's this great part later with there's like dust on a picture and you actually like blow on the DS
523.64,525.64, And the dust goes off the picture revolution
525.64,528.76," That's like yes, yeah, I mean I don't need to be giving blow jobs"
528.76,532.4399999999999, I mean more than I do on the show every way so yikes
533.56,537.6," Well, I'm not playing the show anymore either so I can tell you as it grabs you"
538.08,540.92, Mitch Mitch obviously knows how to do that's close job
541.64,543.64, But working out at a long time
544.12,548.28," You can't get into gaming without knowing a little bit about getting on your knees. Hey, how's it going?"
549.24,555.48," It's a required developer. That's not you getting to fast actually. Oh, yeah, we all stand in a line"
555.48,557.24, And it's kind of like a spanking machine. Wow
558.52,560.52," On that note. Oh, I gotta go"
561.0799999999999,564.1999999999999, Mitch Mitch was telling us earlier that he you're never playing anything else. I mean
564.6,569.0799999999999," You know, I worry crucified Mitch for being a bitch and wanting to just talk about shadow run. No, that's fine"
569.0799999999999,573.88," All right, so Neil's going and get the nails out. You see in crunch time you and then you be blue to shadow run"
573.88,575.88, I'm gonna focus a little man
576.84,578.84, It's just what it is
578.84,583.48," Boy, that was a song. Did you like that one? Yeah, I see that's all read the dive had time to play"
583.48,584.52, Oh
584.52,588.12," Yeah, pretty much I mean what happens is you know, we're in crunch mode"
588.12,590.84, So I started working about six in the morning and
591.56,593.96," You know, I go home about"
594.68,601.32, Seven or so and then I get on mail and then at 930 we play shadow run from home
602.04,604.04," Right crossplay in that beta, right?"
604.36,606.04," No, no, no in our own probably"
606.04,612.1999999999999, Comes oh private not even for the likes of you motherfucker and the well known and documented fact
612.1999999999999,614.1999999999999, Maybe very much just you fit and
614.5999999999999,620.12, So we play that until about 11 11 30 and then I'm on mail until a bit
620.12,624.52, It's not so fun playing it. I mean he's or you guys I play it for work like it's sort of like a job
624.92,628.12, I don't think you'll believe me if I answer the question probably not right
628.68,632.68, So so go ahead and go ahead the risk of doing the Glenn Gary Glen Ross thing
633.56,637.56, It's not funny more obviously it is so there you go obviously he's confirmed right there
637.56,643.4799999999999, It's a longer fun. We probably should the the real answer is that it is incredibly fun to play
643.8,645.8, Having been on it for three years
645.8,647.3199999999999, It is still fun
647.3199999999999,651.16," Every night even though it's not an RPG anymore. He still likes it. Yeah, anyway"
652.68,654.68, I'm shocked
654.68,656.5999999999999, So he's done on the Nells. Where are you Shawn what even plan?
657.88,659.88, Stocker multiplayer this week
659.96,666.28, What was that like it's pretty much what you'd expect it's just team death match team death match and an artifact mode
666.52,670.6, Which is basically single flat like CTF okay? So that build work
671.32,674.6," Yeah, runs actually it runs really well the yeah single player stall"
675.16,677.56, You know versions that they've been sending us don't run so well
678.2,682.92, Which is which is odd because it has all the same effects in the maps or I mean I don't know
682.92,687.08, I say it looks great there's always like certain attachment to put on when you're talking stalker
687.1600000000001,691.96, And that's like it looks great for like this Ukrainian software that was supposed to be mind-blowing five years ago right
692.12,696.5200000000001, But with that in mind it's definitely got a fingerprint to it that you don't get elsewhere
696.5200000000001,700.2, I mean as as you run around the maps and stuff I mean you you're not it's not using you know
700.5200000000001,703.88, Make a texture or anything but you're not seeing repeat a tiling and stuff
703.88,705.88, I mean you're just seeing the stuff that's just there
705.96,709.32, Their whole world design is really different. I'm used to it doesn't have the sort of like
710.2,712.76, Floor planfully feel of counterstriker something like that you know
713.72,720.92, But other the right it's really straightforward. I mean it's just you get your guns and you and this is the MP stuff not the single player
720.92,723.72, Which right straightforward but you get your guns go around and
724.28,726.28, Shoot stuff up and the usual flavors
727.48,730.52, They sent me a revised single player build and I played it and it was like
731.56,736.56," Okay frame rate works now, but that game was really we've laughed it was supposed to be a huge really the environment flat"
736.56,740.76," Yeah, there's quite a bit of verticality and the multiplayer maps is there yeah"
741.3199999999999,744.84, And depending on where you go in the single player stuff by me. Obviously you get in the
745.08,748.52, Where house areas and stuff and you get near the sarcophagus you get near
749.24,753.3199999999999, You know just other you know urban sectors and there's a lot of verticality to it
753.3199999999999,757.48," I didn't play it long obviously, but it didn't catch me very well. I wasn't it was kind of"
758.68,762.84, All right didn't get much kick from the gun wasn't getting much visceral appeal out of it was kind of like all right
762.84,766.68, I mean I get the whole like go around and talk to different people's get different assignments that kind of that parts all cool
767.88,769.88, What's cool to me about it that I I mean
770.36,775.72, And everything is like got that condition on it that I've only played very little because performance problems is right right
775.88,782.12, But what what sticks out to me is that I'm wandering around and you have all those missions like you say
782.4399999999999,784.84, There is a good deal for you them in terms of where you can go
784.84,789.4, It's not it's not a Bolivian big where you have complete 360 degrees from your starting point
789.4,794.04, I mean you will run into barriers in any given direction after a while
794.28,796.28, But you have it's not it's not the
796.6,798.12, You know the call the
798.2,799.4, Company of
799.4,801.4, Getting a confused company of duty
802.68,806.76," That could not call up here. It's too pioneered, but now with like 2d3 I got too much"
807.32,809.16, I mean it's just the usual you know
809.5600000000001,810.76, heavily scripted
810.76,816.2, You're basically following the thread through the level and you're waiting for the guys to come out. I mean and you can you get some of the
817.64,819.48, Sort of emergent stuff where you see dogs
820.36,825.4, Eat and around in a body right you shoot one of them take the guys wall it and you know get the ammo off him
825.56,831.24, Then a bigger animal comes and starts chasing some dogs and they all chase you into a town and then they start fighting the towns and have it
831.24,833.9599999999999, Hence and you run out the back of the town. I mean that kind of stuff is cool
833.9599999999999,836.1999999999999, Where for the first eventually months later
836.1999999999999,840.4399999999999, I'll look at it and I'll say okay now I understand the extent of how this game's functioning
840.68,844.12, But for the first like you know and that's how Bolivian was for me for the first you know
844.1999999999999,848.68, Week or so or month with that game right before you completely understand the dimensions of the game
849.0799999999999,853.24, It has the capacity to surprise you which is something that the standard
853.32,857.08, Cord or FES single player has no ability to do for the most part with me
857.88,863.32," Wow, it's pretty good endorsement. It's like the dust pretty good early and pretty good early like wow it's pretty cool"
864.12,868.92, We'll see but like I said I'm not hanging my reputation on it because that's I mean all all those impressions are about
868.92,870.92, 12 frames per second
870.92,872.92," Well, it's a game come out"
873.64,877.24," I haven't seen it. It should be yeah, it's fun for next month, so wow"
877.24,880.92, I can play right now the reason they're having problems and has a huge memory leak so obviously
881.0799999999999,885.0799999999999, That's what that's the problem. It's got a huge memory leak until they get on top of that and there's sunk
885.0799999999999,891.0, I do the other thing I like about is that it's like I said again. It's just it feels as if it were from somewhere else
891.0,893.0, It doesn't feel as though it were from
894.12,899.16, The school of thought that that's characterized FES making in North America for so long for so many years
899.16,904.1999999999999, It's got a different ride to it. Let's go anything else on your desk that was cool last week or so
905.0799999999999,907.3199999999999, stuff the usual stuff you can't talk about you know
907.48,913.0, Our bar goes this net and the coolest thing of all which is you know not to pentamaxing but it's an exclusive for a cover
913.0,919.0, So I put really like what what issue the April is that it may may yeah
919.0,924.36," So when some people we all detect that out in early April. Yeah, it sucks though. I wish I could at least say what it was"
924.36,927.4000000000001, We say something that if you're PC way would John or is it oh?
927.96,932.7600000000001," I don't do this to come back and give me trouble, but it's yeah, I don't know. It's not FES though"
933.1600000000001,934.7600000000001," Okay, that's fine. That's enough by the"
934.76,937.96," Yeah, I haven't seen Jeff Green angry. I don't really want to ever"
938.2,944.92, I don't Jeff doesn't even get angry. I think it would be more like you know the company and and John and John Davis in that isn't stuff
945.24,950.2, Do you have John as when he gets mad as like horrible? It's all over everything. It's like when you piss off Chewbaca
953.8,957.8, Shane Stern or years gone. I don't know I mean I can play but so what a today
958.12,961.8, EA brought by burnout on PSP same game as PS2 was that's pretty cool
962.12,966.5999999999999, Did you play anyone play any burnout on at all? Anyone play burnout on my like the only right out
966.5999999999999,969.24, I'm the original burnout lover as we talked about how was he?
970.4399999999999,975.0," Yeah, but I don't like cars. I don't like pretending to drive. I don't like actually driving"
975.0,979.4, I don't I like burnout and dominated I'm curious about it because John was saying it's close to burnout too
979.56,985.8, It's really close to burnout too. It's just like burnout too. What I liked about what they do in the PSP version is that to make up for how small the screen
985.8,988.68, And how fast the action is it's really forgiving on collisions
988.68,994.28, And so so if you're like doing like you know like rubbing or if you're doing like trying to do close calls on traffic to fill up your bruce meter
994.28,998.28," They're really forgiving like you can see oh, I should have probably hit that guy on the front corner"
998.28,1002.52," But it let me slide by you know, so it actually makes it playable because you don't have traffic checking"
1002.76,1008.1999999999999," Right, you know there's no traffic checking so that part that actually I was worried about how not having traffic checking in PSP"
1008.5999999999999,1012.8399999999999, Because I don't want to like just sit there and be frustrated and I want to toss the PSP out the window
1012.8399999999999,1014.5999999999999, That's not fun. That's not fun at all
1014.6,1019.96, But it wasn't like that it was like okay if I like really fucked up and was like coming around a corner and there was a car right there
1019.96,1021.64, And I hit him full on goose wreck
1021.8000000000001,1025.24, But if it was like I was coming around the corner and I compensated and managed to slide by them
1025.24,1029.8, Then it was able to slip by him. He played really well. I was thinking you would play that version over the PS2 version
1031.48,1036.1200000000001," Well, I would because for that for that degree of visual fidelity why not play it on the PSP?"
1036.1200000000001,1039.0, It's like if I'm playing at home and I want to play I want to play hi-dep
1039.0,1041.72, I don't want to play get-o 480 eye crap
1041.88,1045.56, Tell that to the 464 thousand new we owners gone it all right
1045.56,1049.32, Foreigned 64 thousand new we owners. I don't want to play 480 get-o crap
1050.1200000000001,1053.48," Anyway, I mean really if you're playing burnout which is like about the graphic"
1053.88,1057.16," We're not halfway about graphics anyway, right? I mean that was like always it's big deal"
1057.16,1061.56, It's how fucking gorgeous it looks for all the special effects. It looks really good on PSP the frame rate was really solid
1061.96,1065.8, Perfect little game to sit down and like screw around with for a little while and then like turn off and be done with it
1066.2,1069.16," Yeah, I'm down. Do you think the last burnout took it a little too far though?"
1069.72,1071.5600000000002, In terms of like finding that perfect balance between
1072.28,1079.16," Risk and reward having it, you know, you do so you do pull off of maneuvering you're gonna crash and the the most recent one for the 360 for me"
1079.48,1081.48, It was just far too forgiving
1081.48,1085.48, I mean that's like I can say it's a button and then the game and then just just let it race
1085.48,1090.2," You know let it knock stuff out of the way. Yeah, that's that's so that's totally the argument is whether you like that"
1090.2,1096.0400000000002, And want to just like run around and not have to worry about it or if you like the actual having some stress and actually having to drive a little harder
1096.92,1100.6399999999999, John and I kind of make a mode just a flip of a switch traffic will
1101.1599999999999,1105.24," Rear and someone and you might crash, but you know Alex listens to this so you run everyone over mode"
1105.8,1108.36, You just told Alex to do that so I may be able to look into it
1108.92,1113.8799999999999, There you go Alex for like the big MMO one think about putting a switch in there flip it flip it for mode to mode
1113.8799999999999,1117.28," Because I think that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, if it were only a switch that would be off"
1117.28,1120.8, But of course you actually have to make shut up fucking real-ness
1120.8,1122.8," No, it's not a reason. Oh, okay"
1122.8799999999999,1125.52, We don't we don't use fucking real logic we
1126.8,1129.6, Swing it's up to me to actually do shit
1130.32,1135.82," By the way, if you guys could just give up your nights weekends and how it is because some motherfucker at a whim on it's kind of show"
1137.08,1141.68," Yeah, yeah, we said flip a switch. I don't care what the wiring is behind the switch flip it"
1141.68,1144.52, It's a switch what like 10 minutes to put into the game
1145.52,1147.52, It's fucking doing for the other nine
1150.8,1152.8, There was such complaints aren't they?
1152.8,1154.8, I'm not talking about being a developer
1154.8,1161.8999999999999, It's hard mode to the extent where there probably is a switch where you just turn it on and you turn all geometry impermeable except for the track
1162.8,1166.56, Could be so they don't even know that they're driving through all the cars
1167.12,1170.8," So it's also got ad hoc multiplayer, but not ad hoc multiplayer. What a throwaway, right?"
1170.8,1174.24," No, it gives a shit no one cares about this score. You better be pouring me some of that while you have that"
1175.2,1177.6, And score internet score checking
1177.84,1179.12, Hmm
1179.12,1182.84, It's like that's like he guys are almost in harmony there. That's like a minor third
1182.84,1186.36, I think next thing you know it'll be like burnout now with exclusive friend codes
1186.8799999999999,1189.9199999999998, I'm more curious about the next gen versions. They really haven't shown it to you
1189.9199999999998,1193.6799999999998, I haven't real everything you've seen is very smoking mirrors on like models and artists
1193.6799999999998,1195.6799999999998, I'm very curious to see the real thing
1195.6799999999998,1198.3999999999999, So it's kind of like what you see about crimson skies two
1199.4399999999998,1201.6799999999998," Anyway, you're looking at my play that you for the rest"
1201.6799999999998,1205.1999999999998, I say I just say it's three right side the don't spoil the boards part
1207.6,1210.24, Guitar hero two for three sixty because we have another build of it in
1210.9599999999998,1214.48," So good, but it's so bad. Yeah, as you can say you kind of said and the internet"
1214.8,1218.6399999999999, So it's so frustrating because the music list still not doesn't do it right for me
1218.6399999999999,1220.8799999999999, And that's the thing is so if you like guitar hero
1221.12,1225.6, It's up to the music list. That's why I think 360 will be the best version is because DLC will save it
1225.6,1228.24, DLC will make it to wear whatever you game whatever game you want
1228.32,1232.08," You can build your game. Yeah, so I was thinking about that today on the train on the way and it work"
1232.08,1236.24, And I was thinking I'm in it's fun. I don't play guitar here. I've never played guitar here at all
1236.32,1240.88, But the 80's version that you guys talked about in a jam like remove the quote from the guitar here
1240.88,1243.36, Guys that said we're gonna have more downloadable content ever would it be real?
1243.36,1246.32, Is stick to think that maybe some of that downloadable content on the 360 version?
1246.32,1250.72," I'll just be the 80's stuff. Oh, yeah, I think I would think like the 87'd be like an expansion pack"
1250.72,1254.64, I would wonder if Sony got some time exclusivity on it because that's what they did with guitar here
1254.64,1258.4," too, but you never know they were there still not talking about that even though we heard about that months ago"
1258.8,1263.2, But so I tell you what's most impressive about playing this even though like the first the first levels even though they've
1263.2,1268.48, Like rejiggered all of the the song list line-ups. I still don't like the first two levels. It's still kind of slow-implotting
1268.48,1271.52, But the it works so well
1271.52,1277.1200000000001, It's like they've had so long to refine it and so long to affect making the guitar that the guitar has the best feel
1277.1200000000001,1283.04, It's it's a flying that's not flying me. It's a explore it's explore it's wide explore and the feel on the buttons is
1283.2,1288.32, Unbelievable and the hammer on and pull off are so natural now it that you really can play the game without thinking about it
1288.32,1290.32, You can just play it and not think about it and then just
1291.28,1297.9199999999998, Rock it's perfect. It's it's it's so perfected the combination of the way harmonics has laid down the note
1298.08,1303.2, Combinations this time and and how well the guitar is working that it's just it's totally fluid
1303.6,1306.0, It's totally fluid. It's awesome when we were at CES
1306.0,1312.8799999999999, We were demonstrating shadow run and they had guitar here all right next to us so all they long all I heard was she's
1314.32,1316.32, Oh my god so bad
1316.32,1318.32, That that's
1318.32,1321.28, Love it the dude world. Oh well let me explain
1321.6799999999998,1327.76, You know it's a broad audience for that game. I'm gonna try to say this right it was a broad audience for that game
1327.76,1329.76, So it attracted a different
1330.56,1337.6, I did oh like it attracted a wider scope of game a rather than a typical shooter loving Xbox 360 fans
1337.6799999999998,1341.04, But you guys are gonna get more of the cosplays jitter and fans
1343.04,1345.04, It's not an RPG fuck this game I hate it
1346.0,1348.3999999999999," Yeah, I've never met anybody like that, but"
1349.28,1352.96," Right yeah, of course not they don't line up outside your door anything"
1353.44,1357.44, There I think there is actually like a firemitch gillman
1358.72,1362.96," Petition they probably they probably pronounce it right also yeah, exactly"
1364.24,1368.08," You're not talking about the list Mac, but yeah and Shane Kim gets emails occasionally"
1368.6399999999999,1370.32, What's my really doing holding the guy?
1370.32,1372.32, There's a fireman's gillman
1372.6399999999999,1374.6399999999999, Guys at dick
1374.6399999999999,1376.6399999999999, It's from here I'm glad
1377.2,1379.84, There is a special Microsoft game studios
1381.2,1384.72, Little survey you know it's like what's it like to work here how are things going
1385.4399999999998,1390.72," Yeah, I look forward to that over here with mgs for on 360 make you buy the console"
1392.08,1393.6, Hear about that survey this week
1393.84,1398.96, There's a survey that's been circulated. I don't know if you started that popular North American research and marketing firm
1399.1200000000001,1401.1200000000001, Where one of the questions is
1401.1200000000001,1409.28, Would metal gear sell it for an Xbox 360 increase your interest in the platform on a scale from one to a hundred with a hundred being the most you could possibly increase your interest
1409.44,1412.48, Where do you rate metal yourself on for on the Xbox 360?
1412.48,1415.1200000000001, I'm just saying research marketing believe
1416.16,1417.76," Yeah, good to see you wait wait"
1417.76,1419.76, Welcome Ryan Peyton
1419.76,1421.76, Did the list are audience
1422.48,1424.48, 232 downloads in Japan today
1425.44,1430.8," Anyway, Shane how about you what you've been playing now? You're not on deadline. You're just like chilling you just sit around here like a cute playing game"
1430.8,1434.84, I was playing I was playing game at my desk which never happens. I never play games
1434.84,1436.16, I watched unless they're fighting me
1436.16,1438.56, I'll play a lot of fighting games in my desk. That's that's the usual
1438.56,1442.48," But yeah, I spent the last week playing through in a coming-week title"
1444.08,1446.72, How was it? Is it is very entertaining?
1446.72,1452.56, What how would you just how did you describe this game tell me a little bit about a mix of like a traditional platformer with some RPG elements built
1452.8799999999999,1458.6399999999999, Like what were some of the four some of the mechanics how did it use the remote and an interesting and unique way?
1458.6399999999999,1460.8," Well, I wasn't like a what's it like a what's it made me not design?"
1460.8,1465.76," Well, I'm not sure if I really started out as a weak game, but I think like you know, it's only we now and they incorporated some some"
1466.6399999999999,1470.32, We elements to it. It's really not that overbearing though. You're probably only way way way. She probably staff you
1470.6399999999999,1475.32," He's in the cyst yeah, you're right. I see got beside that. I'm playing the the chocobo game for DS"
1475.44,1477.6799999999998, Which is can you can you talk about?
1477.6799999999998,1478.3999999999999, I can talk about it
1478.4,1483.2800000000002, When people are so here's how it works with square screen. It's he talks about it and then they call and get mad at me
1483.2800000000002,1487.6200000000001," No, I think that we have to about this one because I actually I like it. I mean, you know, it's cutesy because it's it's all these like"
1487.6200000000001,1491.6000000000001, You'd see Joe really doesn't matter so much of you like it. I know it's just the they just have to call and get mad
1491.6000000000001,1495.2," Well, when there's actually in their calling this game like final fantasy blah blah blah chocobo"
1495.2,1497.0400000000002, So I think that's gonna help to say it was because I was final fantasy
1497.0400000000002,1502.5600000000002, But it's actually a half out of the little yellow birds are gonna help the game. Yeah. It's one of the best multi-player
1502.56,1508.04, Many many game collections I've seen like they're not the same games you've been playing on every other stupid DS game
1508.04,1512.9199999999998," Some of them were pretty creative and has remixes of all the final fantasy music and yeah, it's a it's a nice little package"
1512.9199999999998,1515.72, I think I think I think we'll be surprised by it. It comes out in April
1516.0,1520.0, Beyond that has been playing flow came out the other day. Oh shit
1520.0,1521.52, I've played a lot of flow too
1521.52,1526.72, I like boy flow isn't exactly a game per se and if you come into it like I don't want like the best game ever
1526.72,1528.56, You're right. It's like a stone or entertainment
1528.56,1529.76, It's kind of like a nice
1529.76,1531.76, Interactive
1531.76,1540.12," That's yeah, it's kind of a screensaver kind of thing that's interactive but pretty tested the enjoyment of the game on our two-alt under two different states"
1540.44,1541.84," Yeah, I would"
1541.84,1546.44, When that game is totally three-bong hits and three hours later. I would not even three hours
1546.44,1547.44, I would trick home
1547.44,1550.04," Well, I would write my dad play every 28 days"
1550.04,1556.64," Not feel like so far. Yeah, don't be sober while you play that. Yeah, don't actually don't even talk about it if you're so"
1556.64,1562.16, We're yeah people want to understand where you talk about when you you're making it sound shitty like a fish show or a grateful
1562.16,1567.0," Bitch, although no, it's gonna be there, man. He's like a bit like a fish show"
1567.0,1569.5200000000002, It's like that's green-saver oven and aquarium
1569.5200000000002,1573.24," Yeah, I'm expecting small psychedelia and instead I turn on something"
1573.24,1575.96," No, but like you know, there's definitely not a grateful dead"
1575.96,1577.76, People are not driving across country

1798.9199999999998,1804.18, Motion control is critical to good gaming more important than rumble does that mean the next PSP will be a motion control device
1804.18,1809.1000000000001, We'll be like flying the screen around and watching at the same time think it'll be a touch panel device
1809.1000000000001,1812.0600000000002," No, no, I think about that. That would be wow"

1865.62,1870.94, You know where it's gonna go. It's gonna be on PS3. They should port that to we down notable down notable on the PS3
1870.94,1873.82, It would probably control better on the weathen and doesn't the PSP I'll take the bait
1874.66,1878.66, Down low to one of the PS3 with a right thumb stick for camera control. Could I do yeah? Yeah

1896.74,1899.38, That's what I'm gonna get to sort like the butterfly effect
1903.38,1906.74, Sorry if this has been already discussed on here. I've been listening to the show for a long time
1906.74,1908.74, But I rarely have time to dive into the boards
1909.14,1912.1, Can be out of sight. I usually have a pretty good understanding of what games I'm gonna buy
1912.1,1914.94, I have a pretty solid set of genres that I play. I've been a victim
1915.66,1917.34, I've been a victim of the one-pures effect
1917.34,1919.1, I'm not quite sure where to start it
1919.1,1923.7, But I know when I kicked in full-board Viva Pinata. I had no intentions of buying this game
1923.7,1927.94, I didn't really even read the previews. It's probably better that way but somehow
1928.7,1933.1, Listening to John and Luke talk about it express what was clearly honest and unbiased enthusiasm
1933.1,1938.54, I went from never going to buy it to I have to own it stay tuned if you actually listen to the third segment
1938.54,1940.94, We'll tell you exactly how many copies of Viva Pinata have been sold
1941.74,1944.1399999999999, Obviously the one-up yours effect very valuable

1966.6599999999999,1970.34," Sean you play the show you to verify that not those other ones so much, but yeah"
1971.06,1973.06, Coping here is what doing right I
1973.3,1979.3799999999999," Was infected as well having bought Viva Pinata, so that's like two copies of Viva Pinata that we've sold how many have been sold overall"
1979.3799999999999,1981.3799999999999, That's 50% of their total sales
1981.3799999999999,1986.4199999999998," A lot of people listen to Viva Pinata, so I mean you guys wouldn't shut up about that shit seriously"
1986.4199999999998,1990.32," You said that if we kept playing it long enough you were gonna pick out all this but yeah, but I still"
1990.32,1992.56, Guess what the box he playing it long enough
1992.56,1996.62," No, then I said what the box like I don't want that to be on my show. Yeah, that's the thing like once the"
1997.0,2000.6799999999998, Right the the special edition goes away and like the real one that fits on the shelf
2000.6799999999998,2002.4399999999998," Yeah, yeah, yeah, normal boxes"
2002.4399999999998,2006.24, I'll be okay all the other boards stuff. I have a questions for Mitch. Oh

2008.96,2014.58, We can lay to the fire with the kids before the break and then we'll come back and talk to him about what we want to talk to him about
2014.58,2016.9399999999998," You think we do that? Yeah, I think we do that way the way to do it"
2016.9399999999998,2021.86, So we had a post from my cross who sort of took it under under his own wing to
2022.34,2025.22, Lead the way and facilitate discussion about what people want to know from you
2026.22,2032.54, Xbox fan boy this first post was not actually a question. It was I like make a salt one. Oh
2033.82,2038.9399999999998, That was it this is the way this is the soft one look at the frickin Chris Farley show
2039.6599999999999,2041.6599999999999, You remember that time
2044.58,2047.78," Yeah, do you like Michael so one. Yeah, totally did so"
2048.66,2055.58, Hex hexagonal has a question that's in all caps and says where the fuck is crimson skies three and why are you doing anything besides this game?
2055.86,2060.2999999999997," Yeah, I heard about that one. There are a couple of follow-up posts. Yeah, dude. That's right holy crap"
2060.2999999999997,2065.1, That's right start breaking fingers until he commits to another crimson skies game. Do you have to worry about him committing?
2065.1,2067.1, They're already working on it
2067.1,2069.62, I can either confirm or deny actually
2069.62,2073.86, So actually they're not working on it. What's the name of the studio where the guys who were talking to me on crimson skies
2073.86,2079.86," What's the day one studios you mean they didn't know no? Oh, you taught my air tight. Is that the name of him?"
2079.86,2086.94," Yeah, yeah, there was a fairly large defection from fastest that we were talking about right. Yeah. Yeah. They're not doing crimson skies though"
2087.1400000000003,2090.1800000000003, What did they do I something else? Maybe you ought to look into that?
2091.5,2093.5, They defected why would I look into that?
2093.5,2098.1," Just because they defected and mean they're actually owns the shirt does you who I mean no, no of course you're right"
2098.38,2100.7400000000002, Absolutely and I wish everybody in the industry well
2100.74,2105.9799999999996, Shut up on the IP rights to our crimson skies. Will me you really on the IP do?
2105.9799999999996,2106.9799999999996," Yeah, sure"
2106.9799999999996,2112.9399999999996, So if you should see the concept art in their office what I said me what I met was me is in fastest to do it
2112.9399999999996,2114.74, Right part of Microsoft games studio
2115.4599999999996,2116.9799999999996, But me
2116.9799999999996,2122.7599999999998, Dear crimson skies one of the biggest Xbox live online multiplayer games one of the games is set the standard
2122.7599999999998,2127.3399999999997, I really liked it. It's one of those I loved it. It's one of those games that early on in in Xbox ones life times
2127.34,2132.82," Sent the example that hey, you know what live multiplayer works lots of people will play this if it's a good game"
2132.82,2136.54, And they'll get involved and they'll go do this. That's right. We're really like game. We actually work
2136.54,2143.6400000000003," Yeah, I'm right real fast everything we do usually somebody says you can't do that or that's bullshit and you know"
2143.6400000000003,2147.44, It's set or and then we prove them wrong stop trying to tie shadow running you bitch
2148.44,2154.58, We're talking about ABC always be closing. I'm looking at these questions and like there's like actually later on
2154.58,2159.06, There's some questions that aren't that are actually pretty good and we can probably just come back to a lot of them all right
2159.06,2165.2999999999997, So the crimson skies things a big thing before you let it that's one of the best IP's Microsoft had and instead of reviving that
2165.2999999999997,2167.62, Let's make another future friends. You too. That's gonna be big hit. Oh
2168.38,2170.38, Real well hey
2170.38,2172.38, There's two separate resource
2172.38,2175.44, Susan fusion friend. They needed something to give away with the achievement points
2176.74,2182.18, My condiment crimson skies because they're different dudes making it you know
2182.18,2186.5," It's just for fast a real fast about crimson skies, make aware whatever mechanism"
2187.5,2188.7," Commander, you know"
2188.7,2193.2999999999997, There's a finite number of things you can do at the same time right and we're a highly highly focused little men
2193.94,2199.12, So along with shadow run on that dart board of creative concepts
2199.94,2201.94, What's top of list
2202.94,2204.44, I think
2204.44,2209.3799999999997, Well crimson skies is the one that comes up the most right internally or with people like us bitching
2210.3,2216.7000000000003, Little of both I mean the you know a lot of the people that made crimson skies who are right now making shadow run
2216.7000000000003,2218.06," Just like dude, you know"
2218.06,2225.46, We've got ideas for crimson skies seriously. We got ideas for crimson skies and you know totally listening to that right in a big way
2225.46,2229.6600000000003, But there's a very vocal group of people that are asking us for McOriar five
2230.3,2232.3, So
2232.3,2234.7000000000003, If I was gonna do McOriar again
2234.7000000000003,2237.82, I'd want to do a quote unquote right with the fuck does that mean?
2238.54,2247.02," I just tone a lot of it's tone okay, I think that over time the tone of the the whole McOriar universe is sort of"
2248.1800000000003,2249.5800000000004, Developed a little bit
2249.5800000000004,2256.54," McOriar's cool. It's a cool universe. There's a lot of good things in it, you know, it's a dark universe, but it's it's this blend of"
2257.42,2262.78, You know a high-born nobility and stuff like that and then this sort of Korean war
2263.5,2270.5, Your combat and to smash that two together and then add in like this sort of nights of the roundtable
2270.5,2276.7000000000003, Sort of feel where your your giant steed is actually a giant robot. It's kind of cool and then to set it in a place like
2276.7000000000003,2277.9, Cocivo
2277.9,2279.6600000000003," You know, we're the feel of cocivo"
2279.6600000000003,2284.98, Right everything's gone and we're going through these you know these crowded streets that are all broken down
2284.98,2287.78, Sort of like you know the stalling ground levels and call it duty
2287.78,2293.6200000000003," But as a console gamer, I always viewed McOriar is kind of like scary and daunting whereas McAus salt was more accessible"
2293.6200000000003,2296.88," And yeah, I'm really back McOriar as a console game. I'm like, oh, I know that's for me"
2296.88,2301.1600000000003," I don't mean for console and that's so you know, I mean Microsoft game studios"
2301.1600000000003,2304.42, You know Microsoft has this commitment for games for windows
2304.42,2307.4, So Sean what do you think about that? I mean did you play much McOriar?
2308.1400000000003,2310.1400000000003, I didn't know I'm on that
2310.1400000000003,2312.1400000000003, Why nobody likes it
2312.86,2314.86," I have to explain it's not least yeah, oh"
2315.42,2321.28," No, just like I was I was primarily a console game for the longest time and then it was shooters that lured me over to PC and then"
2322.54,2327.1200000000003," State both you know, but so there's a lot there's like a big definitely a big historical"
2327.58,2332.08," Yeah, I remember how huge McOriar two was when it came out"
2332.08,2337.42," I worked a retail and like that in the expansion. It was colossal. Yeah, wow. This is a big deal and that was a lot of units"
2337.42,2340.78, It was horrible. It was a huge deal and again
2340.78,2343.3, It was a long time ago no did it peak there are mercenaries
2345.7000000000003,2351.96, I think it peaked there. I think it peaked there. I don't quote me on this Chris
2353.3,2359.08, But I think it was something like with all the OEM stuff. It was like seven million units. Yeah
2359.08,2361.58, It was like a miss here comes us. Yeah
2362.06,2366.54," Well, you like most people listening will give a shit about my opinion, but here's a deal if the chauffage"
2366.54,2370.1400000000003," giant giant robots. Yeah, I'm a fucking dozen but crimson skies unique"
2371.1,2377.2," A great show. I made a funny face. Well, I was just thinking I just the mech where you're designed like at sucks"
2377.2,2381.06, Like what does that mean? Well that that makes themselves I don't like like blocky
2381.54,2385.5," Well, they look like it looks like you know kids taping cardboard boxes and paper towel tubes and stuff"
2385.5,2390.3799999999997," I mean like that's a good point no, let me let me respond to that because there's a lot of that"
2390.3799999999997,2393.2599999999998, That's how we mock them up because I know a lot of people like that too
2393.2599999999998,2397.06, Right now someone's out there like oh my god there looked that way because they're speaking there's strong
2397.06,2399.06," Anyway, the Nile and it was my last thing"
2400.54,2404.46," Right, well, okay, right now someone was painting like a figurine. They're like no"
2405.46,2407.46, Were they like
2407.46,2413.86, Were they gotten there? They're little lad like whatever feminine? What is it even a jelly and hey
2417.86,2419.86, I'm like yeah
2419.86,2422.6200000000003," Yeah, tell them you don't like those big black and romance"
2423.86,2428.58," Well, what are you we've done we've done surveys of people because that's of course"
2428.58,2430.58, I make games by asking everybody what they want
2432.58,2436.1400000000003, A little is made for example. It's just big online survey no underwashing
2437.1400000000003,2439.1400000000003, Kill your family
2440.5,2443.1400000000003, I will kill your ethnic group that's always my wife
2443.14,2448.5," Yeah, but there are penal there there are people out there that say you know the quote is you know"
2448.5,2452.04, This is like a game for my grandfather when we talk about McLoryer
2452.04,2456.0," No, really it is because you know because of the blockings you were talking about it"
2456.0,2463.94," Yeah, well kind of but the again the Korean war was actually the influence for the art style it really was"
2464.14,2468.3399999999997, You know this kind of that whole lost technology and it's all old and clunky
2468.3399999999997,2471.64, But what people are looking for it. We had a warrant for this more like like
2472.44,2476.44, World War II recession so Soviet stuff that I mean then like you know patent it depends
2476.44,2481.3399999999997, You know and then there was the clans that came in and there stuff is all new and shiny and higher tech but
2481.8799999999997,2483.24, You know
2483.24,2485.92, There's slow the max even though they go 90
2486.6,2490.12," kilometers per hour I had to do that translation, but you know"
2490.12,2497.48, It's still too a lot of people that kind of slow and kind of clunky when what they want is this sort of fast moving into feel nimble and the idea of
2497.48,2502.04," You know it doesn't necessarily appeal to some people, but if you"
2502.44,2504.44," It was all a game of heat management, right?"
2504.76,2509.08, For some people it was a game of heat management. How about you make crimson sky with heat?
2509.08,2513.8, No crimson's go without the fucking planes planes turning to fucking 1930s robots
2514.36,2519.28, Take oh see that now you should be a game to follow up on the game design career on
2519.28,2522.12, For old days wings on this week's one-up yours
2522.52,2526.12," What about that you've if you heard of a machining crigger? No, what's okay?"
2526.2,2534.2," It's just this it's like someone in between like the slick super sexy, you know even jelly and robots and the microwave stuff this guy"
2534.92,2539.7999999999997, From Japan basically took an idea and took our world war two stuff and moved it a little bit into the future
2539.7999999999997,2543.96," Where it's got this futuristic vibe to it. Yeah, but it's still definitely like situating world war two"
2543.96,2547.08," Yeah, but it's just it's just really cool stuff. I mean yeah, that's the thing right now"
2547.08,2551.4," It's like let's just do an alternate world war two then right, but yeah, it's not like resistance"
2551.4,2553.8, You gotta go glued if you want to believe me
2554.76,2561.32," It looks better in the town, but that's that's I guess the problem with McOrior right now is for sort of the new generation of gamers"
2561.32,2563.32, They look at it and they go that's called school
2564.44,2567.4, Then you're moving away from what it is
2567.7200000000003,2570.52, What did I look like not the way in thinking then who knows?
2570.92,2575.36, I know it's fast and it was a little bit about doing alternate words worlds alternate words
2575.36,2577.04, We have alternate worlds for every
2577.04,2579.04, I mean
2581.04,2583.34, A little bit about doing ultimate alternate ultimate
2585.34,2589.6," Anyway, there was a transition there anyway, fuck it. I don't care stick around will be right back"
2589.6,2591.12, I'm just gonna talk about shadow run
2592.4,2596.7599999999998," Yeah, they're really my game development. Yeah, I flew out here to talk about a little bit just one sound bite"
2596.7599999999998,2598.7599999999998," Now, thank you love you"
2598.7599999999998,2601.2799999999997, Just glad he listened to the show stick around will be right back
2603.4,2606.4, You're listening to one of yours part of the one up radio network
2607.44,2617.24, Can't get enough of deal dot TV then download our podcast just go to deal dot TV and click on the audio link
2617.24,2622.88, Turn the moves you'll be able to listen to Patrick Robert and the rest of the gang over and over and over again
2622.88,2627.12, Over to you here canal clean and don't share if you don't want to risk breading disease
2627.3599999999997,2644.68," All right, we're ready to dig into some shadow run with Mitch by the way as many people in the internet know him the fucking tool who made a shooter out of shadow run"
2644.68,2650.48, That would be me how dare you I dare do he meddled us those who dare metal horns. That's right
2650.48,2653.88," I did I've a guess is to why they're doing it this way, but I'm an aluminum talk first all right"
2653.88,2660.2400000000002," So yeah, so with the fuck's the deal dude. Why why take a brilliant RPG we were going to turn it into a brilliant first person"
2660.2400000000002,2663.6," She I guess we still have to wait for that, but yeah"
2664.52,2666.52," Really, why it what's the deal?"
2666.92,2671.96, Why make it a first person shooter in first place like the biggest fucking that was the number one question right of course
2671.96,2678.04, Why why but why and I think the other question I mean for a lot of our listeners might be what the fuck is shatter on?
2678.04,2680.32," Okay, okay, I think that's probably the place"
2680.32,2684.6400000000003," The fuck the fuck is shatter run the intellectual property no, I don't want time with the right"
2684.6400000000003,2686.44," All right, I'm gonna show power down. What is shatter now?"
2686.44,2689.7000000000003, There's like that whole big argument website with like the comic book series
2689.7000000000003,2692.04, I read that one time I was like what the hell is this shit?
2692.04,2696.56," Well, but the existence of the IP and the fans like he are the reason why people ask why is this a shooter?"
2696.56,2700.0800000000004, Sure absolutely I mean you as I say I'm it. It is a good role plane
2700.0800000000004,2704.04, You deserve the fan base. I used to be a big nerd and I really
2705.6400000000003,2710.0800000000004, Clearly that time is bad. I played the shadow right in pinnip paper game with my friends during college
2710.08,2714.52, What the hell is that your monophilament? I had this really awesome monophilament a whip keep that in your hands dude
2714.52,2719.36, Zag it was a really unique world. It is it was like the best cyber punk in a source book
2719.36,2723.2599999999998, You could get out there and there were games for super Nintendo and Genesis that were both really well
2723.64,2728.98, Regarded these RPG right and when we first heard that Microsoft had purchased the license and you guys everyone assumed
2728.98,2732.3199999999997, They're making like an MMO that make us awesome RPG everyone got so excited
2732.3199999999997,2735.64," Yes, and then when they find a girl revealed as a shooter mass disappointment"
2736.44,2738.24, Mass hysteria disappointment
2738.24,2743.4799999999996," Gas and dog living together right and of course don't forget the petitions fire mix get them and yes, yeah, that was awesome"
2743.7599999999998,2746.6, Again send my it's in those requests to me. I'll be glad to sign up
2747.7599999999998,2753.4799999999996," That's GL4 that one up that cutting people do that when they announced uh, you know halo wars"
2753.4799999999996,2757.9599999999996," Oh my god, it's a shooter where they are already doing training making this strategy game"
2757.9599999999996,2758.9599999999996, I think that's what Luke said
2758.9599999999996,2760.6," No, that was what I said actually"
2760.6,2762.6, I said I said I said
2762.6,2766.3999999999996," I thought they could trust game the least all love to ensemble, but that game is doomed really"
2766.4,2769.4, What do you think so back to you okay?
2769.4,2773.92," We go back no really if you want to go back to the marketing my game on do it, but I'm marketing here"
2773.92,2776.92, I'm you really want to hear go on. I'm I hear the what you don't want to hear
2776.92,2779.36," All right, I know you already bore me go"
2779.6800000000003,2781.6800000000003, Just like in jumpires three
2781.6800000000003,2784.76, Good six should a universal transcend John Rundra
2787.4,2792.56," All right, but transcend is John or enough that it was a doll game at one point did you know about that?"
2792.56,2797.12, You had Shane it was an action figure game like a hero click skin
2797.12,2801.96," Oh, there's there's gonna be one of those for a low there was one for crimson skies two was there?"
2801.96,2803.96," Yeah, yeah, absolutely"
2803.96,2812.44, You're and I'm sure my question the guy who created hero clicks is the guy who created the crimson skies in the microwave universe and the shadow on universe
2812.44,2815.4," There you go, so I think they're doing a halo game, too"
2815.4,2817.04, That was just an answer during like you know
2817.04,2817.68, Is that right?
2817.68,2823.8399999999997," Comic-con yeah, I'm not just being a jerk. He's not we're gonna buy them all I assume I haven't given to let's say he wants the boss"
2823.8399999999997,2825.8399999999997, Shit kidding me
2825.8399999999997,2828.96, I don't need to be like too Luke with love
2829.8399999999997,2832.8399999999997, Microsoft and we take it makes total sense to me to make a
2833.52,2839.24, RTS on I say have you right here? You are right here was there ever an MMO plan was that ever real?
2839.24,2845.2799999999997," No, no never never never real there was somebody doing an unauthorized MMO and you guys shut that down"
2845.28,2847.92, Season to sit we were the board F you
2848.48,2852.48," You know, yeah, you can't just take my stuff and just do whatever you want with it"
2853.1200000000003,2858.6800000000003, I might do something good with the last time Microsoft season to sit it was those kids who are making the good halo RTS
2858.6800000000003,2862.8, And it was like two weeks before they announced that I said six so I mean
2863.2400000000002,2867.0800000000004, There's a shooter for shadow run to me. It makes sense that you guys would do a shooter because
2867.2400000000002,2872.92, The Xbox 360's market is ultimately is a lot of shooter fans and they haven't really spread out from that
2872.92,2877.7200000000003, That that no spread is evidence in the sales of some game like the U of Paniata where if you can get people
2877.7200000000003,2883.76, Interestingly IPv2 shooter that would seem like a gateway drug toward remaking our PG that was exactly what we were thinking yeah
2883.76,2885.12, It really is
2885.12,2888.64," For you know, it fast that was but that's not why we made it a shooter"
2888.64,2893.52, That's the additional logic that comes on top of it right the real reason we made it a shooters
2893.8,2899.52, We make shooters every game we've ever made is a shooter right we're a multiplayer shooter
2899.96,2902.2, Joint and that's what it is and oh by the way
2902.2,2905.44," We make campaigns to go with our multiplayer shooters, but that's what we do"
2905.68,2909.88, So you know we put together the people at the crimson skies the people that did make war
2910.04,2914.48, The people that did mechas salt and then I heard John Howard the lead designer at halo
2915.16,2917.92, What do you think I'm gonna do you know like making our PG?
2917.92,2923.36," I'm gonna make a shooter cooking game. Yeah, exactly. Now. It's gonna be awesome. You know it's like you know"
2923.52,2925.12, Kicked up a notch
2925.2799999999997,2929.2," So yeah, we made we made a multiplayer shooter it just duh"
2929.6,2932.0, You know it just makes chatter run goes emerald
2935.2,2940.0," Well, yeah, that's what we did with the Shadow and Universe you have these different character classes"
2940.0,2944.72, Very unique and that plays well into this counter strike style game where you have multiple character classes
2945.3199999999997,2948.3199999999997," Yeah, you know we were calling it like shadows strike for a while"
2948.56,2953.88," Well, no, they were calling it halo strike one of my testers are originally just calling it halo strike"
2953.88,2956.76," Oh, I call it I after yesterday I call it halo with gadgets"
2957.08,2962.4, It's in terms of the pacing of the way the radical moves and the way the characters move with their jumping and the floaty
2962.4,2969.2400000000002, It's it's halo with like treats that you can't you don't have a halo why break something that works and sells millions and millions of units
2969.2400000000002,2973.6," It just doesn't make sense to me, right? And it didn't make sense to us the control scheme of"
2973.8,2978.2400000000002, Shadowrun is the control scheme of halo because that's kind of like the gold standard
2978.6,2980.88, Now for first person shooter that console
2980.88,2984.28," On a console, but on a console and to jump into and so that we can"
2984.28,2985.88," Yeah, I'm sure Sean's coming"
2985.88,2989.42," Yeah, no, it was a bit as far as like the adaptation to PC"
2989.42,2994.44, I mean Shadowrun is sort of the it is what's being pushed as the emblem of live anywhere and Sean
2994.8,3000.92, Sean's experience yesterday on the PC version wasn't necessarily indicative of a game that was developed from the ground up as a PC
3000.92,3003.44, Game right when you were talking to me about the menus yesterday
3003.44,3006.6800000000003, I just we are we ready to like jump to this level of I mean first
3006.6800000000003,3008.6800000000003," Yeah, no, let's get your game"
3008.7599999999998,3010.7599999999998, Yeah
3010.7599999999998,3015.6," Okay, well, I need a big part of the experience as far as you know as I'll look with saying is that it's"
3017.08,3021.04, Introducing live anywhere you have cross platform play you have you know people in 360 playing
3021.64,3023.68, PC people right and this is a big element of it
3023.68,3027.68, So at least on paper here's a game for PC players and a game for 360 players
3027.68,3032.1," Yeah, but I guess I was just wondering to what extent you know when you're saying it's a no brainer"
3032.1,3037.68, You when you when you have halo movement speed and you have halo gravity when you have halo amesist and you have you know all these things
3037.68,3042.3199999999997," Then it's a no brainer to make a 360 game along those lines, but those are all things"
3042.3199999999997,3046.7999999999997, I think are not necessarily universally despised by by hardcore PC shooter players
3046.96,3051.44, But they they're understood that those things are very very appropriate on console and
3052.0,3054.96, far less appropriate on on and less welcome
3054.96,3059.3999999999996, I go to the way I'm gonna turn it back any information. Why is that inappropriate on PC? Okay?
3059.96,3061.64," And by the way, it's not all"
3061.64,3065.52," 360 right, you know, okay. Well, let me let me okay"
3065.52,3070.0, So let's say if you obviously you have aamacist on on the control when you're playing with a controller
3070.0,3076.6," Sure, right and that that makes sense because of the the less per pixel accuracy of the analog stick compared to a mouse right"
3077.28,3082.88," Totally makes sense. Yeah, but and you have that there so that when they're playing against people with that per pixel"
3082.88,3085.12, I actually have a mouse that you have a level playing field
3085.52,3089.96," No, we have it on here because that's what makes a good first person should run console. Okay"
3090.28,3097.16, So here's my thing is like as I was dying like it's I get the sense that well for one the movement as I as I'm moving around with the mouse and stuff
3097.16,3099.96, I mean my looks speed is definitely PC shooter
3100.12,3104.44," Yeah, but the character movement is very halo and the jumping is very halo so"
3105.08,3109.96, It would translate to me to about like if you're playing in a low-graph server team for just counterstrike or something
3109.96,3113.7200000000003, And as soon as you jump to jump as to die you get or quake whatever you get railgun
3113.7200000000003,3117.64," You get because of the because of the auto wave. Yeah, there was nothing else in the game"
3117.64,3121.48," But running around and shooting yeah, but shuttle and so much more than that so"
3125.72,3127.72, I don't know
3129.72,3131.92, I want to hear what John
3131.92,3136.92, I want to hear you go have to see off on that because that's bullshit. I don't want to be like a fence reading
3136.92,3142.0, I'm just saying no it's my experience and I I like what I played you know like let's get that out first
3142.0,3145.3599999999997," I didn't know that yeah, it's isn't like God that was a piece of shit"
3145.36,3147.76," I can't wait to say how much I hate it. It's not that at all, but"
3148.2400000000002,3154.0, Looking at it in terms of this is a game for multiple audiences and how is it gonna work for these audience now?
3154.32,3156.56, What came to mind is I was playing was like okay
3157.28,3162.7200000000003, Everyone always wants to have this grudge match forever and you said this is a chance not to not to settle the score is
3162.88,3165.84," Controller better than mouse or vice versa, but let's all get together"
3165.84,3168.96, Let's all try together. That's important. But I know that's always there
3168.96,3173.04, More playing. I'm seeing people like you know Greg Ford eat jams like I got you
3173.04,3176.28, I got those PC guys and and I think you'd encourage that right? I think it's not a
3178.68,3184.96," And I'm like okay, dude, but your cursors just tracking fools around on its own on the screen and even though like you could be"
3184.96,3186.56, That's true with the PC
3186.56,3191.88," But this is yeah, I'm very reductionist, but like when you go from one to the other that's how it feels to me"
3191.88,3198.04, And that's how like a lot of console like shooters feel to me playing like great amount of time on PC shooters
3198.12,3201.88," Yeah, it feels like they're playing themselves to it to an extent now you don't accept those terms"
3201.88,3204.36," I know you won't accept those terms, but so that's cool"
3204.36,3209.32, Long-winded and now what I'm getting to is it was like if you say once a year you're like let's take the the five foot guys
3209.32,3212.84, And let's take the seven foot guys and let's all get it get a pickup game going
3212.84,3217.96, Now we're gonna have an eight foot high rim for these dudes and we're gonna have the ten foot regulation for these guys
3217.96,3221.48," Yeah, like that's cool. We can let's get together and do that again sometime next year"
3221.48,3226.96," We'll try again, but it's like you don't want to spend your whole year playing that on the eight foot rim dudes"
3226.96,3232.56, versus the ten foot rims just because that that works out for the fight the dudes are four and a half feet tall
3235.2400000000002,3241.16, What if they wait wait wait what if the game was fun right what if what if game was fun
3246.16,3251.04, I mean I was a couple of weeks ago and they said you know we start off making our games fun
3251.04,3253.36, That might be something you would look into is that right?
3253.36,3254.96," That's a new concept, but wait"
3254.96,3260.16, Let's just say let's just say that it was I don't think you're right
3260.16,3262.7200000000003, But what if it was five feet five footers like myself
3263.36,3268.56, versus seven footers right and the games were tied
3269.76,3274.64, You know all the time and it was an an edge of your seat experience right and it was fun every time
3274.64,3280.32, Who gives shit right? I still think in my experience that the people eventually get people would want to play
3280.8,3284.0," And they're oh you've like okay, we've settled at that's cool. It's there and again"
3284.0,3287.28, This isn't saying your game doesn't force people to play as far as I know
3287.28,3289.6800000000003," It doesn't force people to play in these circumstances. Oh no, not at all"
3289.6800000000003,3294.2400000000002, And I'm thinking it would be cool if not only that like if you were on the PC side because it's not even just
3294.96,3300.7200000000003, 360 versus PC it's controller versus mouse because you have excellent 360 controller support on PC
3300.7200000000003,3302.96," Yeah, I think I think that also has a badge"
3302.96,3307.84, So we're gonna play this with a controller on PC isn't that one of the ideas here that like on this and I
3307.84,3311.36, Mean it's like like the many system like Sean and I talked about yesterday
3311.36,3318.6400000000003, Sort of supports that very controller center. It's very controller actually the interface changes when you plug in a controller
3318.6400000000003,3322.84, Which was totally nuts because I was playing on PC because Mitch was trying again yesterday
3322.84,3326.44, He convinced me the PC doesn't suck which by the way. I agree. It's still sucks
3327.1600000000003,3329.1600000000003, You would you're selling exactly
3331.6000000000004,3333.6000000000004, Why does the PC version suck?
3333.6,3336.36, It feels like a console game that is exactly right
3336.36,3337.88, It never shields right
3337.88,3339.24," Well, but what does that mean?"
3339.24,3340.88," Hello, it's on the middle of the world"
3341.36,3343.2799999999997, Speed is a happy season for a second
3343.2799999999997,3348.2999999999997, Because I because I have a reputation me the stupid guy. I'll tell you because I just play games my feel when I play
3348.48,3350.2799999999997, Shadow run with mouse and keyboard
3350.2799999999997,3355.16, I'm not comfortable when I play it with a controller. I am locked in the totally fucking natural
3355.16,3359.4, The real deal right the reason why that is I mean to be supremely
3359.6800000000003,3368.1600000000003, simplistic is because it's halo with gadgets and the way that you know that pacing that you're used to if you're coming from a PC shooter background
3368.1600000000003,3372.64, And you pick up halo the first thing you do when you pick up halo if you've been playing CS you go
3372.64,3375.12," Oh my god, this is so fucking slow"
3375.12,3378.7200000000003, I'm jumping this is terrible. This it lies the redical move so slow
3378.7200000000003,3385.28," Turn the sense it's hitting up ten and it's still too fucking slow. It's imprecise. Okay, and that's the same experience that people as I mean"
3385.28,3390.0400000000004, That's like that fundamental difference between PC shooter and console shooter with Sean's getting it
3390.0400000000004,3391.88, That's why it feels that way to you. Okay
3391.88,3399.38," I was looking for specifics like that. Yeah, so say for example when you're when you're moving at that speed and when you have a"
3399.38,3402.48, Assist I think it's almost impossible to to dodge
3402.88,3407.0400000000004, Using not using your powers. It's almost it's almost impossible just to dodge by by jukeying
3407.0400000000004,3412.5600000000004, You're not strafe jumping. You're not bunny hopping or these things. They won't really be effective in getting you away from an SMG fire
3412.72,3418.2, So I think it's a great move again for the console senses. You have teleport teleport to eight to ten feet
3418.2,3422.12, And I can see there's so much so many wonderful possibilities for that you're able to go down
3422.2799999999997,3425.66," You know, so like you could just a night crawler type shit. Yeah, you're on a"
3426.0,3430.2, You just crouch down to go through the floor. You point up go up or something and that's so great
3430.2,3437.88, But the sense I got playing that again and again it works great on consoles like it's it's there as a means of dodging in a game with aim assist
3437.88,3442.7400000000002, And will slow movement. It's also a great way to dodge and play vases and it's like and again
3442.7400000000002,3448.32, That's a very console centric type solution to a invasion and and and joking and stuff to me
3448.6,3453.04," Coming from like a strafe jumping world where okay, you know, so in a PC world"
3453.2000000000003,3457.48, You're strafe and you jump and you right right and you exploit the physics of it
3457.48,3461.6800000000003, So that you're able to build momentum increasing with each jump. I get it cuz in shatterruns world
3462.1600000000003,3464.1600000000003, Use your powers
3464.1600000000003,3465.1600000000003, You teleport
3465.16,3471.0," You're trapping into the thing that you glide you glide off. Yeah, I mean there's like five or six ways of disengaging from"
3471.0,3475.5, Compass that you don't do another. Let me ask you a question. Are you are you tapping in a thing that like they used to call bounding?
3476.3999999999996,3479.24," Well, yeah, it has a million different forms bunny hopping straight jump"
3479.24,3484.44, But like are they're different and and that's what I knew it is but like we can like manipulate the physics of the game
3484.44,3487.48, So to like you were you moving in a diagonal and jump to you're moving in the highest
3488.0,3491.7999999999997," You're really using your you know, yeah, you're left and right keys, but why is that superior?"
3491.7999999999997,3493.48, That's not that's not not
3493.48,3499.88, Even one like necessarily say that but say like the speed of like half life death match where you have a sprint button and you jump and you can you move really fast
3499.88,3505.2, And it seems really cracked out to like to I think compared to the pacing of a console game what can
3505.2,3507.2, superior to me because
3507.2,3511.72, With that format with that interface because you're able to to move and look so much
3511.72,3516.34," Right, more rapidly and precisely that you need harder to hit targets because of it and"
3517.0,3520.68," Conversely because people aren't using the slower, you know analog stick"
3520.68,3525.8799999999997, They don't need you to be slower so that they can hit you so it's just a matter of like it just
3526.24,3532.2799999999997, Appropriate to the interface is really partly also. It's a matter of which which character race you play too
3532.2799999999997,3535.3999999999996, For example if you were playing a troll you're really slow if you're playing an elf
3535.3999999999996,3542.72, You're really fast and if you were to buy wired reflexes tech ability you're your double secret fast on top of that too
3542.72,3546.7999999999997, So maybe you just didn't get the full range of the movement and I'm not trying to defend it or anything
3546.7999999999997,3549.3199999999997, But you know there's probably just more to it than that
3549.32,3553.94," Right, so we didn't know the studio directors not defending the game. No, he's just don't fucking troll"
3553.94,3555.44, I'm not that I think I mean
3555.44,3557.94, I mean I'm not troll it's open season in my job
3557.94,3563.1400000000003," No, but I think that that's one of the things to talk about was that I mean we sort of all I mean garnet and"
3563.1400000000003,3567.26, Sharan I were all at the session two days ago now by the time this airs and we all did play the game
3567.26,3572.1200000000003, So I think that it's it's probably pretty reasonable that we talk a little bit about actually like the play experience to you
3572.1200000000003,3573.6200000000003, It should just like right
3573.62,3583.7799999999997, I mean if I just said if you ask me for one word what's your play experience slow or another one
3583.7799999999997,3589.56," Conquer me two words slow console I mean that's not minutia. That's no, but it's also what I came away from with it"
3589.56,3593.54," Wait wait, so Mike's your game was wrong you're then right. Yeah, okay"
3593.54,3600.54, Told you it was a pretty short experience show it was it was a short experience and that's what I sensual it was that I want to add
3600.54,3603.74, You could have stayed on freaking day to all and there wasn't a vending everything
3603.74,3609.36, I've said there is it was a very short experience with the game. How ever there is something I mean
3609.36,3612.8," I don't want to get all pops likeology, but you heard about the glad wheels book blank right"
3613.2599999999998,3617.5," Yeah, yeah about you know the extraordinary power of you know snap judgments"
3617.5,3622.86, And I think more so than anything that when someone breaks something down and tells you this game is good because it
3622.86,3628.2799999999997, It performs this function this function this function this function when you ask an average person they experience something
3628.28,3630.76, They come away and they just got that shitty and green on their face and they're like
3631.2400000000002,3635.6000000000004," That was fun. I want to play more. You know, and it was like and that is the sense you know"
3635.6000000000004,3637.2000000000003, I've also another elsewhere
3637.2000000000003,3641.7200000000003, I've converted to the hairs in the back of your neck and you can use that bitch and those were definitely going on for people
3641.7200000000003,3646.4, shoe at EGM on the console experience came away saying like I'm gonna go back there tonight play some more
3646.4,3650.0400000000004, I really like you know it so those are the things that like again
3650.0400000000004,3654.52, I mean I don't know you could say I'm special pleading or what but I have a very good track record of like
3655.08,3659.56, Life long battlefield. I mean not like as long as back get around and when 24 42 came out
3659.56,3661.96, I played it you two play sessions and I was like
3662.28,3666.9," This isn't gonna do it. You know, and then it was later on when I understood the reasons for it"
3666.9,3668.64," Yeah, the snap judgment proves so right now"
3668.64,3672.22, I had nothing against the game. I really wanted it to be here's the game
3672.22,3674.32, I'm gonna play for another 365 days
3674.32,3678.2," Yeah, and it was just a case of like my snap judgment on that"
3678.2,3682.16," But but snap judgment with the when I soon as I plug the controller and was like, hey, this is a great"
3682.68,3688.0, Controlled base but also like I tried to adjust your mouse sensitivity and it didn't work right off the bat
3688.0,3690.64, I think all of a sudden it's just like look I sat down at the controls and
3691.12,3694.64," At this very moment they're not quite right, you know"
3694.64,3699.2999999999997, And like the default config is completely wrong which a could have been a bug because we're not
3699.2999999999997,3702.94," Yeah, yeah, you know, I mean so your snap judgment is based on not a shipping game"
3703.22,3705.7," Right, which isn't quite fair and also I"
3705.8599999999997,3709.6, Maybe didn't hit the button right to get you the sensitivity you want to right off the bat
3709.6,3713.52," So you know, I'm just saying it's it's not it's not completely"
3713.52,3717.2, Very good about that. Any given day how many testers do you have playing this game?
3718.68,3723.24," Just quick off top of your head just go up. We had 20 okay, so the way fastest set up"
3723.24,3728.12, They actually have two test studios across the hall for me each other right because they constantly play it competitively
3728.72,3735.6, Very competitively what's the feedback from the people who like the PC version are they first of all
3735.6,3738.68, Are there people who like the PC version? I want this text amongst the testers
3738.68,3742.3399999999997," You meet okay, what do you mean prefer for for for for what did I say?"
3742.3399999999997,3746.88," Why why why you said like which like the man to please the loaded question, but if you prefer"
3746.88,3751.7," So people are I mean the test started playing the PC version. Oh, say what's your feedback? Why do they like it?"
3751.7,3753.2, It's real
3753.2,3757.24," It's just matter preference, you know, I don't have how's that influence how's that influence?"
3757.24,3760.88, What you've done with the game then the statistical breakdown of the preference. I know you haven't done this survey
3760.88,3763.92, The more numbers the ratio
3764.96,3771.1600000000003," No, but why did these people prefer the PC version because they're just because you know, it's like for me"
3771.1600000000003,3774.7200000000003, I learned how to play first person shooters on mouse keyboard
3774.7200000000003,3777.84, Right I learned to play shadow run on the controller
3777.84,3780.8, I'm more comfortable with shadow run on the controller
3780.8,3786.56," I'm getting pretty good at it in the mouse key. Okay, so what did it take to get the controls right for PC with mouse and keyboard?"
3786.56,3788.96, I can't answer that in the reason why I
3788.96,3792.06, That's the answer. I'm on the issue. I should look into that Michael. I mean it's a
3792.16,3794.84, Electricity into that. I'm not it's cool. It's just
3795.6,3799.32, What it is. I don't know. It's technical shit that I don't deal with you know
3799.32,3801.32, I'm very high level
3801.32,3804.48, I've got like three stars. Oh my god
3804.48,3808.58," I'm not the white my shoe. You know, oh no, it's no sage mariles are core"
3809.32,3813.04, Multiplayer desire and he's one of did if you go to shatteron.com
3813.2,3817.84, He wrote a little essay on how they did it a little bit more isn't it more like a dissertation
3817.84,3822.1600000000003," It's somewhere between ass and dissertation. Yeah, something like that. It's pretty lengthy as far as like yeah"
3822.1600000000003,3825.76, I'm not a multiplayer design. We're not hiding anything at all. There's nothing to hide
3825.92,3829.2000000000003, You know it works and I think it works well and all you have to do is do some
3830.08,3834.32," Adjustments and also that the menu to do it, you know bring it up, you know on screen"
3834.32,3840.08," Mm-hmm stuff like that. It wasn't working right right so whatever, you know, but how did we do it?"
3840.08,3843.28, I don't know I don't I don't I don't I don't care it's a mystery
3843.28,3846.8," I just don't care. It's fun. I don't care. Well, you play with a controller"
3847.2000000000003,3851.44," I play with the controller. Yeah, then why the hell you've been trying to sell me on playing a mouse and keyboard"
3851.6000000000004,3855.84, Because I've got this mouse keyboard game. I'm selling to
3856.6400000000003,3862.1600000000003," Jesus, I want PC gamers to play I game everybody from PC gamer the other day"
3862.7200000000003,3867.2000000000003, You know love the game and they played it mouse keyboard only they never even touch the controller
3867.2000000000003,3869.28, Are you trying to sell me on PC gamer having a
3869.52,3871.28, Remote
3871.28,3873.28, Easy
3873.28,3875.28, John or here he would not accept that
3875.28,3878.4," But um, but John's that here it's my show at the moment. Thank you very much"
3879.0400000000004,3883.36," What I wanted to talk about a little bit was just actually the core mechanics of the game. Yeah, yeah"
3883.6000000000004,3886.32, I mean you you talked yesterday and you talked a little bit
3886.7200000000003,3893.2000000000003, I mean a little bit hyperbolicly about how it was you know yeah a little bit about how it was like the first time I've ever seen you know
3893.28,3897.84, Like the use of magic and like the use of like the use of tackling I still think it was like
3897.92,3905.84, I still think you waiting it's innovation in the good job of the John. I still don't think I've done a good job of defining for people who are listening and we're what like fucking 25 minutes into this
3905.84,3907.84, Like what that's what it's like
3907.84,3913.76, Like let's not do Pillsy constipers. Let's do what is the game? What makes it unique? I'll give you I'll give you one example
3913.76,3915.6000000000004, And then I won't mention to talk more about the game
3915.6000000000004,3918.48, Because that's important. He hasn't given me that but I understand what game this is
3918.48,3923.6000000000004, But I want to tell you that I stayed after our demo session in play with like the Edelman and Microsoft guys
3923.6000000000004,3927.44, And they did this thing called like the what was it called? I believe the term use of the office was
3927.44,3933.92, Ambush rate it was our teleport ambush rape and like they had a troll who like I was chasing this troll
3933.92,3936.7200000000003, And I go around the corner chasing the troll. I'm like totally gonna kill the troll
3936.7200000000003,3942.4, I'm like I got this guy wired and then next thing I know three guys teleport through a wall behind me and just
3943.44,3947.76, Ask rape the shit out in like in the second in a second. I don't like to like harm this man
3947.76,3953.12, I run into the hall and like where am I getting shot from my turn around and there are three
3953.28,3955.28, What's the what's the name of like the corporate?
3955.76,3960.32," All right, hey, there's like three RNA guys behind me with guns just going nuts. I'm like"
3960.88,3965.52," Fuck them dead. Yeah, well, that's been like houses of our day buses the forces of DNA"
3966.6400000000003,3969.44, I was talking to a friend of mine today just that I'll recombient gonna win
3969.44,3973.0400000000004," Amen, he was like duty plate chatter running yesterday. I was a guy and that's and then he's like"
3973.0400000000004,3978.0800000000004," Well, what did you think and I said what I said at the beginning of the segment which was like halo with gadgets and he said"
3978.0800000000004,3982.4," Well, what do you mean halo with gadgets? I said well, it's pretty cool to like teleport through two walls"
3982.48,3989.52, Which to katana and then ghost and then like come on a ghost and sneak up on a guy and stab him and kill him and then like teleport out
3989.52,3994.64," Well, for you and like that's I mean that's something that you're not like I haven't really had an FPS experience like"
3994.88,3999.6800000000003, I thought that that was fun. I haven't got a chance to play a bunch of the maps like and I'm just talking about very core
4000.08,4005.28," Like console gaming, you know experience on only a handful of the maps. I mean the map design is gonna be a big thing"
4005.28,4010.32, I mean all the players a huge is almost like the soul focus of the game the bots do seem pretty bright
4010.8,4018.32," Yeah, they're real fun. But the game is a multiplayer game and it's the community is gonna drive basically and like that sort of experience was it was unique"
4018.32,4025.44," And it was interesting absolutely you know the thing is you say halo with gadget whatever. I mean, you know a great game with gadgets"
4025.44,4033.76," Okay fine, you know take that. Yeah, it's not meant to be pretty cool. No, it's cool. No when you were saying before it's like when you were saying, you know, what's the overview and you know"
4034.1600000000003,4036.8, Me being sort of hyperbolic and saying how innovative it was
4037.76,4042.4," I don't think it's hyperbolic really for example, you know in"
4044.7200000000003,4051.52, Perfect art zero you can see through walls right right and in Jedi night you could do force push
4052.1600000000003,4056.5600000000004," All right, so I'm not saying that we invented every single one of these"
4057.04,4061.52, Powers or abilities what I'm saying is that when you put them all together and to be able to
4061.52,4066.8, Combo them the way you can and shadow on and they have the four races with their own innate abilities
4067.2,4073.36," You know it's a unique experience. Well, I mean, there's something particularly promising about the game at high levels for a player to be in a"
4073.52,4078.72, Situation where they have like the katana which blocks bullets if you have a certain skill and to encounter
4079.28,4082.16, In a bit and to encounter to enter an encounter or you don't have
4082.56,4087.92, What's it lightning reflexes that would just a wired reflexes active and to be able to be swift enough on the control
4087.92,4094.64, It to hit the navigate the tech map menu and map it quickly and activate it block bullet bullets and then say like whoever you're fighting
4094.64,4098.24, Like there's the potential for a great deal of skill at least I mean
4098.64,4104.72," I don't I can only speak to the console version, but something like that's gonna be pretty rewarding to go like takes to be a part of in our"
4104.88,4108.8," Experience yeah, I totally agree no one no one that we were playing a job"
4108.8,4113.6," Like on the EGM or or one up in there there could do anything like that obviously, but I mean, yeah"
4113.6,4115.04, Have you had a kill yesterday?
4115.04,4117.04, Have either you guys played the specialist
4118.0,4121.280000000001," Is that the share is a half lifetime body really cool, but it's basically"
4121.76,4126.8," He takes your own sort of a spell a weapon. Yeah, with all full time and they would have like"
4127.04,4130.72, Where you be able to disarm people you'd be able to so what you could do is equivalent combos
4130.72,4134.8, And it worked really really well and if you could pull off those so satisfying now there are people in the studio
4134.8,4135.92, They can pull off
4135.92,4141.52, Lile shit that I couldn't possibly hope to and that but that the prospect of that to me is someone who's you know
4141.84,4148.160000000001, I think it's pretty well documented that I like shooters not in the same way that Sean does I like console shooters
4148.4800000000005,4152.8, But so but so it's interesting though like you can deflect bolt by you press a button and with a bit
4152.8,4159.040000000001," No, it's coming based on you activate as long as you activate a pat as far as I would it's a passive skill that you"
4159.040000000001,4161.360000000001, That you can't have that map to a shoulder button
4161.360000000001,4164.0, You could have maps so you're talking like you're going into a fire fight
4164.0,4166.88, You're like I'm gonna put let press left bumper so that I feel like full no no
4166.88,4170.280000000001, I'm not even telling that I'm telling like I have glider teleport and
4170.36,4172.599999999999, Ghost mapped and then I'm like oh shit
4172.599999999999,4178.2, There's like two dudes that just jumped me and then I'm saying like what I'm doing is I'm hitting B bring up my menu
4178.2,4182.04, hitting right on my pad bring up tech bring up wire reflexes
4182.5199999999995,4188.12, Mapping that to right trigger real quick hitting it right trigger putting all that up and I start deflecting bullets and then just Katana right right
4192.12,4196.36, Trust that you had almost every single thing right accept the right triggers the left
4196.92,4201.4, That was a ball I would have been for us to bumper right back right bumper that's where I would have put it
4201.4,4209.799999999999, That's right so just to answer the question Sean yeah if you there are passive abilities and their active abilities right and so for wire reflexes passive
4209.799999999999,4213.48, You move faster you jump faster you reload faster right and
4214.599999999999,4219.799999999999, If you're holding the sword you can deflect some bullets not everyone and you just can't deflect the shot
4219.799999999999,4224.04, It's like a it's a flat it's sort of like a would you equate it to like a flat damage reduction
4224.04,4228.68, Basically like if you have wire reflexes active it's gonna deflect a certain percentage of the bullets like yeah 45
4228.68,4232.5199999999995," Never ducks yeah, but don't think of it as damage reductions literally purple it"
4233.08,4235.96," Well, you know, but you but you have to think if you're thinking about it and like"
4236.84,4238.84, The third time is already to go off
4238.84,4242.84," If you think about it, you know, it's a flat damage reduction over time basically"
4242.84,4243.96," All right, so I'm gonna choose the problem"
4243.96,4248.28, I've given you a ton of shit and I have to tell you the reason I give you a ton of shit is because I actually like your game a lot
4248.28,4252.28, And I okay I have had a ton of fun every time I have played this game
4252.599999999999,4260.599999999999, Here's what worries me the most about this game. Okay that the price of entry is too high for it to be a mainstream success
4260.599999999999,4261.5599999999995, I was
4261.5599999999995,4266.679999999999, The price of entry you'd like like he talking like a price tag no you're talking about the learning curve
4266.679999999999,4270.84," Okay, so the reason I assume that's because I know that like sitting beneath this whole discussion"
4270.84,4276.04, There's a discussion happened later today that's is a multiplayer only game good enough
4276.04,4279.719999999999, Or is it half of a game? You know what and I was like I'm from the camp where hell. Yeah. It's totally a good
4279.8,4284.6, Absolutely and as much as they put into this game. I'm really impressed I do I so I give you shit and I'm gonna
4284.6,4287.0, Back off the ship for like two seconds here. So I
4287.240000000001,4291.88, You got a lot of props to seconds. I'm impressed with the amount of drink depth it's here
4291.88,4295.16, I'm impressed with how well the different character classes work
4295.16,4299.16, I'm impressed with how well weapons versus magic versus tech works
4299.56,4305.08, But what worries me is that I'm gonna be the guy walking on the office going with someone fucking play shadow
4305.08,4308.360000000001, Runway because that's the game you never played that kind of thing
4308.36,4310.36, That's that's exactly what you don't want
4312.36,4315.96, Especially when the IP really I mean the IP should get a shooter and then
4316.5199999999995,4319.4, I mean strategically like I thought what earlier in RPG to follow
4319.799999999999,4322.5199999999995," No, the best game first. I mean first is the Tomb Raider clone"
4322.5199999999995,4324.36, And then come see our PG
4325.639999999999,4329.08, Don't I can let me interject here. I'm a shadow run fan
4329.08,4332.759999999999, I'm a fan of the IP and I'm not a big shooter fan. I only play shooter like every four years
4332.759999999999,4335.88, I'm not a big shooter fan. That's why I don't talk what I expect to see you
4335.88,4337.88," I'm like, hey, yeah"
4337.88,4342.04," Let me tell you all this for one second. No, you hold this you hold this let him answer my question"
4342.04,4344.04," All right, okay, what's the question?"
4344.84,4355.04, How do you guys envision the casual game market or just a bigger the broader game market as a casual gamer my experience with shadow
4355.400000000001,4359.72," Okay, that's what you need not a hardcore shooter fan. Okay, let me tell my anecdote. I think it's good"
4360.12,4364.68, I did not play the game today's ago because everybody else was going I played a D3 and say we went about the E3 build
4364.92,4371.240000000001, I walk up to a shadow on kiosk. I'm as a shadow run fan. I'm very curious about this and like I'm gonna play this game right all right
4371.64,4373.64, I'll walk up there and what if first thing
4374.200000000001,4376.68, Why just turn my my sorry wrong button. Thanks
4376.92,4381.4800000000005," So I walk up see all these fancy buttons. I walk up to the kiosk, okay, and there's a a"
4381.8,4387.240000000001, Partboard sign taped to the screen with the word underwhelming tape to the screen
4387.4800000000005,4394.280000000001," I go to the guy who's demoing the game. I'm like what does that mean the word underwhelming? He's like, oh, that's the name of this game"
4394.76,4399.56, Because it's part of a multiplayer network. What's that a very good name for this kiosk underwhelming?
4399.56,4402.200000000001, A I thought that was like the review of this game
4402.6,4404.360000000001, That was like that's bizarre check check
4405.0,4410.6," But so I was like oh, like you give me the demo and he gave me the full demo and it was a pretty good demo that taught me the powers and stuff"
4410.6,4412.280000000001, And so by the end of this demo
4412.280000000001,4415.8, I was teleporting is around I was like wow this game is a lot deeper than I expected
4415.8,4418.12, Like a lot of depth to gameplay
4418.52,4422.84, I'm not expecting from a shooter and I was like wow. There's a lot of some shooters dude
4423.0,4426.12, I'm a player that many shooters. I don't know if I only play a shooter every three years
4426.360000000001,4430.360000000001," So when I play this it's like well, a lot of moves all its own classes. I was like this isn't what I expected"
4430.360000000001,4432.52," Yeah, like and as a shadow around family"
4432.52,4437.08, I think I can get into this because it's almost like an RPG because there's so much customization to what I can have
4437.400000000001,4444.52," Yeah, and like I was interested because of the depth of gameplay and you can adapt it to your play style like the type of game right"
4444.52,4447.16, I was playing I was playing an elf and I'll like be fast and I was like wow
4447.16,4451.4800000000005, Like I can really customize my experience and I was interested because of like the depth you guys offered
4451.5599999999995,4455.959999999999, At the same time I was like wow I look over at gears of war that game looks a lot better at the same time
4455.959999999999,4459.639999999999," Oh, that's because it does I mean aty three aty three"
4460.2,4462.2, You know it was like night and day
4462.839999999999,4467.24, You look younger and first gear's a war the way I love shadow on looks a lot better now than it did it
4467.799999999999,4469.799999999999, I should hope so yeah
4469.799999999999,4472.28," Yeah, it's nice that you added a lighting model that was impressive"
4473.24,4477.959999999999," Yeah, but do you worry about the whole fact and even though you have all this depth that like just because you don't look as good"
4478.04,4481.24, There's a war people are gonna like write you off right off the bat aty three
4481.96,4485.96," Yeah, I mean it was a big deal. It was a giant kick in the nuts right"
4486.92,4491.4800000000005, That's a bunch of questions to answer oh yeah tell me about it's like let's go to the beauty show
4491.72,4494.84, Nobody's gonna stop and actually play your game. They're just gonna turn up their nose
4495.4,4498.04," Because you don't right well, no one was playing it so I said I'm playing it"
4498.04,4501.72," Yeah, actually kind of yeah, yeah, yeah, it occurred to us too that that was kind of a bad thing"
4501.72,4506.36, I wrote the one up thing on a chat around. I think you did where you were you weren't one of the people
4506.36,4508.36, It said fire your artists there with the whistle
4508.36,4513.48, I think I said like good shoot like potentially good shooter shows potential for a lot of depth
4513.639999999999,4517.719999999999," Wait and see yeah, pretty sure that's probably that was the kindest thing we got"
4519.719999999999,4525.08, I heard like I said that that's probably the if you played that's something to it about people that least like
4525.639999999999,4531.799999999999, If you didn't play if you just saw I didn't I didn't get a chance to play but everyone told me hey never mind the fact that it looks like a
4531.88,4537.320000000001, C.S. modern making maps like it's actually it's fun it plays well and that got around like that got around
4537.320000000001,4542.12, And that's exactly what you were saying you're like it looked that way because we didn't give a shit about putting the polish on it's like about
4542.12,4548.6," It's like a house, you know some people didn't but there's some people couldn't see the forest through the trees without a doubt and some people"
4549.16,4551.64," In power couldn't see that you know what I mean, but"
4552.360000000001,4554.360000000001, There's a couple of things to answer
4556.360000000001,4558.360000000001, In playing in Microsoft they were upset with the way it looked
4559.16,4560.6, Wouldn't you be well
4560.68,4566.76, I don't know if it's next to gears of war yeah exactly look look the power of Xbox three at the power of
4566.76,4573.08, Xbox 360 is like these next generation high-deft graphics how am I supporting that message was shadow on a D3?
4573.08,4574.280000000001, How are you?
4574.280000000001,4575.240000000001, poorly
4575.240000000001,4578.68, But the gentleman was like the live anywhere you know is on this day. Yeah
4578.68,4584.04," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and live anywhere was like a like the message of the"
4585.0,4589.72, The press conference three build against is the one who announced my game. That's never happened at any three before
4589.72,4594.2, But let's blow that already right now. I think he's totally sporting like those fun bill Gates
4594.2,4597.24, Not my game. I just I just want to point out that I predicted that
4597.96,4603.16, I know I'm sorry Bill Gates also freaked out at CES was like why are we only showing shooters?
4604.84,4606.84, I didn't get that email
4606.84,4613.08, So let me just respond to saying it's just what I've heard the one thing is and just why did it look that way at E3?
4613.96,4622.04, Fasten makes games backwards from other game companies. Okay game play first game play first hardcore game play first make it right no vertical slice
4623.72,4625.4, Eventually we do a verticals. I love that
4627.24,4629.88, What the game company doesn't do that anymore by the way
4634.6,4639.24," You want it for a long time yeah, I got why epic's been doing it for a long time"
4640.04,4644.2, What he's saying is backwards is basically been epic's like mo sense
4644.2,4645.719999999999, That's the mo for every
4645.719999999999,4646.92, Epic's doing
4646.92,4651.88," I think gorilla that gorilla doesn't do it. No, epic's those the sizzle. I mean you guys were in every good game"
4651.88,4655.0, But like you tea they don't start putting on the reason you tea looked like
4655.4,4660.76, Similarly people said the same thing it looks like whatever just like generic corridors with like metal shine
4660.76,4664.5199999999995, It's a normal mapping dimples on them is because they're creating maps
4664.5199999999995,4668.5199999999995, They're creating the foundation of the house and then they're going on later and putting the paneling on and if you look
4668.52,4673.160000000001," Game in primitive is it works right yeah, and that's a big deal and a lot of companies"
4673.160000000001,4675.88, I'm telling you they do it they do this sizzle first
4675.88,4682.040000000001, Because they does this sizzle for it. We're learning but they do you know you do that because you need venture capital money or you need
4682.040000000001,4686.68, What the hell is the developer can't you just hire some hired gun to go out and build you some cool
4686.84,4693.200000000001, Ardid up bullshit to sell your stuff wait Sony did that at E3 2005 was it? Sony's done that everybody
4693.200000000001,4694.88," Yeah, okay, okay, just so no"
4694.88,4698.8," No, no, no, but yeah, I mean they're not alone, but they mean the x was six last year"
4698.8,4701.04, It was like PGR4 is announced here's Fnv
4701.04,4703.52, I mean just save it able to that's a beautiful CG yeah
4703.52,4709.6, That's a great final fan. Why do we have it in what's the real question is why did you even have in gaming?
4709.6,4714.96, Do we have to show this stuff so much in advance where you don't with I mean some some in some cases
4714.96,4718.56, How would you do but most you don't so like for real if the issue is for you?
4718.64,4722.04, You know people's base or instincts are to judge these books by their covers
4722.2,4727.56, Then why why show it at that point some made a mistake did you make a mistake or did the same guy
4727.56,4732.28," But they made the mistake when I want to make the mistake, but nobody played I played his game and his game was fun"
4732.28,4736.2, The plate even though it didn't look good. He was like I want to go back to that who decides to show Shatteron
4737.32,4740.28, Did you decide to show Shatteron or was that a decision that comes from above?
4740.6,4745.76, That's a decision that comes from above and is that I can't point a finger at one person?
4745.76,4747.16," Okay, I know I'm sorry"
4747.16,4752.36, But it is a decision that that is made outside of like I just want people understand that it's not fascinating
4752.36,4756.4, Who goes hey time to show Shatteron it's someone else who goes but it's time to show you a quite fair
4756.4,4760.28, That's not quite fair. I mean I want to show Shatteron because I thought I kicked out
4760.28,4764.5199999999995," Yeah, and you're it looks questioning implies it showing you show me three was bad and I don't think it was even though"
4764.5199999999995,4766.5199999999995, I was bad
4766.5199999999995,4771.72, Or proven have like the tendency to judge books by their covers as stupid as that is but you know
4771.72,4773.72," Yeah, you can't change that"
4773.72,4775.72, That's
4775.72,4777.72, I played in
4777.72,4783.240000000001, Because people don't see all the innovation doing they don't see the gameplay
4783.240000000001,4784.52, They don't see the live anywhere
4784.52,4789.0," Right, so because what you're causing the graphical fidelity yeah, you know when you're walking"
4789.0,4796.68, I want to hold him on this because your point was that if we divide games backwards and backwards being that we make them fun first
4796.68,4798.68," That's right, then why does that fun not come through?"
4799.320000000001,4800.52, Because you
4800.52,4803.64, Nature let him answer because it's human nature
4803.96,4808.68," Okay, it's just the way it is don't look at me like that. It's not going enough. Go on. It's like no"
4808.84,4813.88," Go on you can oh you can extend this so easily. No, hold on. Let's go to porn from yeah"
4813.88,4814.52, That's right
4814.52,4815.72, And it's worth that
4815.72,4820.360000000001, But everybody back at for it fastest city is going of course. He went there
4821.0,4827.72, But let's face it head is head right the act is the same and your grip can be fantastic
4828.2,4832.04," Right, but if you look like I know the marcos you're not gonna sell the game"
4833.320000000001,4837.08," Yeah, you know thank you give me my freaking dollar and expect cases give him some"
4837.08,4838.280000000001, That give him some
4838.280000000001,4842.04, If you paid five bucks for that hookup you're not expecting it
4843.320000000001,4847.64, It was three the reason I say that is because I can go with so many
4848.76,4851.64," Where are we going with this? Okay, here's why I said that though"
4851.88,4857.240000000001, I'm going to any any given mod it and I routinely find games like the specialist which I mentioned which are great in this
4857.8,4862.4400000000005," They look like total shit yeah, but when you but the position you ran it was like 360"
4862.4400000000005,4865.64, You know this is like your your big powerhouse and you're gonna pay all this money for it
4865.64,4867.64, It's been like harness human energy and all the stuff
4868.92,4871.0, So you get to that point and then you're like
4871.0,4875.0, How does it look like human energy? That's right and then that's the whole rule that's it
4875.56,4879.72, And let's face it no man we're on the Florida E3 that's the show
4880.12,4884.84," Yeah, right people aren't looking at your game with blinders on going oh I get it"
4884.92,4889.400000000001, See what they're doing man right they're going they look across the aisle it's something else
4889.96,4894.4400000000005, You know even saints roll those pretty Bob Ross. It's it's true that E3 is not the best venue for
4894.4400000000005,4896.4400000000005, Are you sure the best venue for you?
4896.4400000000005,4899.08," Oh, she has a great personality and that's what you're getting"
4899.08,4900.84, No real life is the best
4900.84,4903.96," Super host yeah, it's a good for a melt that she rocks no seriously"
4904.12,4909.72, I would say real quick now that no one's looking at anything and they're listening this podcast and you have control over what's going in their ears
4910.68,4917.16, What what is it about the game that makes it innovative and that makes it stand out when you know graphics at a year ago aside
4917.8,4923.96, Options options options I mean I said this the other day when I was demoing for you guys and I'll say it again
4924.6,4927.56, You know we have more verbs and we have
4928.04,4931.8, verbs that you want to use what it's totally you're looking at me like I'm insane
4932.360000000001,4934.6, You totally tell a port you can fly
4935.08,4940.4400000000005, Wow tell us a Michael you and I had this conversation other day people who give bullshit generic answers instead
4940.4400000000005,4943.320000000001, That's finding instead of defining what they mean right?
4943.72,4946.120000000001, I would have he could have said what he meant but instead he said
4946.4400000000005,4950.68," Rubo boobs so all the stuff all right thing, but the thing is you cut me off"
4950.68,4952.120000000001," Yeah, you're going to the right"
4952.120000000001,4953.0, I didn't cut off you are
4953.0,4957.400000000001, The way I got trained in high school is you start with your thesis statement then you go to your supporting
4957.400000000001,4961.0," Okay, yeah, I am ready to maybe"
4961.0,4962.84," All right, so look for example"
4962.92,4964.84, When you get a tree life you got a
4967.64,4974.52, You don't a per se pack when you go into a first person shooter right you see the enemy and you're looking at him right
4974.92,4979.400000000001, What can you do even you engage with the enemy? What can you do you shoot you?
4979.400000000001,4982.6, You can run you can jump and you can throw a grenade
4982.92,4988.12, Maybe you can get into a vehicle and run away a drive away and you can
4989.4800000000005,4992.4400000000005," That's it. No, okay, you can what cut is throat"
4992.5199999999995,4994.5199999999995, In assume the shape of his body
4994.5199999999995,4997.4," Uh, team forches classic and then go into his base"
4998.12,5001.48, For who's in the genigranades and for in front of his teammates and cut more their throat
5002.04,5004.04, Retend your body
5004.04,5008.679999999999," Okay, no, but you can I mean you could teleport but not only that you could throw the teleport"
5009.16,5012.44, Destination at a person and so you materialize inside their bottom
5013.16,5014.679999999999, Bad up bad
5014.679999999999,5015.5599999999995, Shut up
5015.5599999999995,5019.48," Bitch-flap total no no, no, I'm just saying there are a lot more"
5019.959999999999,5021.879999999999, This was my thing when you did your demonstration
5021.879999999999,5026.2," Yeah, I thought you were really reductionist and you said there was wolf and sign 3d and then now there's I mean"
5026.2,5030.12," I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being reductionist, but you know, we did the end of your discussion you said"
5030.5199999999995,5035.639999999999," No one's innovated so you know, we're gonna innovate if you go online and you listen to consumers"
5036.2,5041.08," That's what they're saying where's the innovation that's true. It's true. Oh, which is that one's a product of a"
5041.08,5045.16, But no god. I don't know. I'm gonna cut you off before you can get that girl
5045.48,5052.04," No, but it's like you're fucking making the troll can you can you for example in the game you're talking about where you can throw the teleport deal"
5052.04,5057.8," Right, that's just you. Yeah, that's bill based. Yes, totally. Yeah, can you combo a tell other thing"
5057.8,5061.16, I'm frugging and you can't use go list can you combo it with other things?
5061.5599999999995,5063.72, That's the thing about chapter. I like say for example
5063.72,5066.599999999999, You have a rocket you know a bunch of guys are throw your teleport above in the air
5066.68,5071.5599999999995, Miturize above and shoot a whole bunch of rockets down straight down into over something was your really simple example
5071.8,5075.88," It's a it's a pretty simple example, but remember there's just a lot of stuff and shadow run to do"
5076.200000000001,5082.120000000001," Right, so go on back to my deal where you you engage with the enemy and then you're one of you dies"
5082.68,5087.4800000000005, It's pretty much what happens you engage with the enemy one of you dies and shadow run you can disengage
5087.96,5093.0," Multiple times multiple ways, right? I can teleport away through the floor through the ceiling through the enemy whatever"
5093.0,5098.92, That's one thing. I can glide I can glide teleport. I could turn to smoke so that you know if there's a crossfire
5099.16,5103.4800000000005, And I turn to smoke you guys actually shoot each other right through me right and they got
5103.96,5109.64," Yeah, as an example and there's point counterpoint to it, right? I could summon those crystals that I showed you the other day right"
5109.64,5113.08, Where I put a wall between us or I could summon them right under you and you're trapped in it
5113.08,5118.28, You're doing that grizzly dance a death and then you can throw grenades on top of them as another example. I mean
5118.84,5122.4400000000005," I just listen a couple of other all hands right. Yeah, and those are all cool. I think they're all bad"
5122.44,5127.4, What I was reacting to is just like if you say like we'll write will present something and he's like
5127.719999999999,5131.799999999999," Well, I'll work it on this game and you know, it does this and this and at the end of the thing you're like okay"
5131.799999999999,5136.12," That's poor but you were like you could do this and not only that, but this is like the first time"
5136.599999999999,5139.639999999999, That you've been able to do anything along these lines in any game
5139.639999999999,5143.48, But on my head I'm like every time you show something. I was like and this is nothing against you like tree of life
5143.48,5144.28, I'm like okay
5144.28,5148.44, And junior's uh med ammo station you're like uh revive. I was like okay
5148.44,5153.799999999999," We'll you know shock paddles or whatever or you guys crystals like dark Messiah's Bramble patch, you know"
5153.799999999999,5157.719999999999, I mean and if you look at all your top line putting them together is awesome
5157.96,5161.799999999999, But it's just like when you stay when you turn around say not only I'm putting them all together
5161.799999999999,5165.08," And it's fucking awesome, but I'm the first like we're the first ones to ever do this"
5165.799999999999,5169.4, And there's never been anything that's I think you may have read into that a little bit
5169.4,5172.44," But also I don't think he did, but let's face it all you guys"
5172.44,5174.759999999999, I come to a family of sales people on both sides
5174.76,5177.72, My family so now you're just my family
5178.84,5182.04, Easy it's the truth. I'm gonna break you guys up
5182.04,5183.8," Yeah, yeah, no no no no no no no"
5183.8,5185.8, Just a table. Let's roll
5185.8,5189.08," Well, okay all these different verbs talking about yeah my concerns is balance"
5189.08,5191.96," I'm like you can add all these cool shit in your game, but like what are the end of the day?"
5191.96,5193.56, One of these things into being overpowered
5194.2,5195.400000000001, What if well
5195.400000000001,5197.400000000001, Everybody gonna do about how Zack what are you gonna do?
5197.400000000001,5200.12, You do the question fix it patching what I mean
5200.12,5203.64," Are you hoping you do like you're gonna fix the all in post like oh, we'll see what happens when it goes out there"
5203.72,5206.12," No, I think the game's been a development for three"
5206.12,5208.84," We'll pull the plasma pistol off the maps. Yeah, it should be fine"
5209.96,5215.72, We just lost so much bungeecred like they're like Frankie sitting there going that mother fucker
5215.72,5218.6, I would pick his ass and just sand just sand
5218.6,5220.6," Yeah, but the plan is game for three years"
5220.6,5221.400000000001," All right, right?"
5221.400000000001,5222.6, Like it's possible
5222.6,5226.280000000001, That takes you have to about I mean like it's not like you're the first ones have to like balance
5226.280000000001,5231.0, Yeah multiple class but they have all these powers all these races it seems like they have a
5231.32,5233.32, Greater mix oh
5233.32,5243.0," Okay, great Shane I would tell you this I have played this game four times seriously twice with people who really knew how to play it and I have no clue"
5243.0,5246.2, What I want to play because nothing out of all things
5246.2,5252.84, I've tried jump dot at me is overpowered nothing is tricking me is like oh my god this is broke these are my combos like I had yesterday
5253.8,5260.76, Or two days ago with Mitch I had like a set of abilities that I preferred and I had like a couple weapons that I like to use and I had like a
5260.76,5266.84," Way that I had started to play the game, but whether or not that was overpowered or game like I want to until a month into the game"
5266.84,5269.96," Right, yeah, I'm not gonna find about I'm actually going to find out an hour and a half"
5270.2,5276.92, Here's the problem. I'll see your thing about the learning curve no one has proven to me how someone who just likes to play games
5276.92,5280.96, Picks up the controller and enjoys this game and a total evidence ready to
5280.96,5284.32, Happy at the event. You guys left
5284.8,5288.36, And this is true and wolf was there so he's my PR guy. He's gonna totally yeah
5288.36,5291.88," Yeah, I totally will believe the PR guy nods"
5291.88,5297.56, But I can never imagine I can probably get your hurry mail address woven came in she was from gamer Andy
5298.2,5300.2," Right, she said look"
5300.2,5302.2, 87 years old
5302.2,5304.2, She
5304.76,5306.76, I said wow
5306.76,5309.5599999999995, So she came in she's like look on a casual game person
5310.04,5314.84, You know don't bother with me. I really like right you know because she was there with another game
5314.84,5320.599999999999, A gamer Andy person who was hardcore and stuff like that so she was just watching him play and she decided to just get on herself
5320.599999999999,5324.679999999999, And she got on and she did the tutorials by herself later on
5324.92,5329.54, We got her into a real game with us and she held her own and at the end of it
5329.54,5332.84, She comes up me and I swear to you on my children's fucking heads
5333.56,5337.32, She came up to me as she goes I don't believe this I like this game. This is a cool game
5337.32,5339.2, I can play this game. It's a first person shooter
5339.2,5344.76, I don't play first person shooters. I like this one. That's encouraging. Okay. She had slow experience with first person shooters
5344.76,5347.68, Otherwise she wouldn't be calling it first. I choose you saying it's the game where you work
5347.68,5351.0, It's a game around me. She might know what a first person shooter is
5351.0,5356.24," Yeah, you made this game and it's another one of those kind of games where it's a gun that floats around and I actually like this one"
5356.72,5357.72, I think it was like
5357.72,5360.0, But that really happened the way I described it
5360.0,5363.28, That was cool. I think I got in and by the time you know
5363.28,5367.48, I had to switch over to controllers and having all the issues with the mouse looks speed when I did
5368.12,5370.36, Like you were you were like okay
5370.36,5373.56, Because I wanted to skip the tutorials like catch up there and you're like suit yourself
5373.56,5377.52, But so I skipped it and I was like I need I have an SMG and I have a grenade on one button now
5377.52,5379.52, It's fine and I killed everyone like you know
5379.52,5383.28," Well, you said this one I came about gun shooting"
5383.28,5388.34," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't take don't twist dude. He's playing against a bunch of don't wait until you turn you"
5388.34,5393.759999999999, Dude anyone with a mirror ounce a testicle skill like he when I was playing is right time
5393.759999999999,5396.4, So I'm just saying that like even if you don't work
5396.4,5398.48, We're gonna put that in as an announcer for you
5398.48,5404.04," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sir. There's someone together a pill of you such a silly porting guys. That's not ghost. That's God"
5404.04,5409.36, If you me I haven't answered them you use your some you know you said me she ain't gun grenades and you're still you with a whole drone
5409.36,5413.24, I mean that that's what I'm saying like and then like a two more game
5413.24,5416.32, Then I figure out then I add other things to my vocabulary either new verbs
5419.32,5421.32, My mother
5421.32,5423.32, That's the same time
5425.32,5427.32, Wait what's your point
5427.32,5433.28, I'm the same point there's no the whole thing of price of entry. I'm saying like it didn't if you have any familiarity with like the genre
5433.28,5435.5599999999995, It is pretty accessible
5435.5599999999995,5437.24, I like
5437.24,5442.36, Like you know natural selection or dystopia or any of these other games where they're like
5443.24,5446.92, They're like extraordinarily off the beaten path and what you need a tutorial
5446.92,5451.32," Wait, that's why the weapons in the game the way they are what's your runs about Sean"
5451.92,5456.92, We gotta get there eventually about it's about taking the vocabulary of the first person shooter and then
5456.92,5458.92, Adding verbs to it
5459.48,5463.5199999999995, Like start on the box start it off with cool and we had a dude
5467.36,5470.5599999999995, Hi down there to add verbs finally
5474.2,5480.62, You got admit that it's an entry into the game going look there's run and jump shoot and stuff like that now we're adding new verbs
5480.62,5485.04, It's a perfect segue into what we're doing with the game. It was completely legitimate
5485.04,5488.8," Yeah, the marketing wizard is it a pretty good job coming up with that all right"
5488.8,5490.8, I did it myself but whatever I get your point
5491.96,5497.599999999999," So anyway, to your point garnet I think the ease of entry is there. I agree with Sean again"
5497.599999999999,5502.32," I'm paid to agree with Sean, but that's why the weapon is I'm gonna look I'm set in three or four times"
5502.32,5508.28, I told Michael to see their day. I think your tutorial is shit. I've said this so many times and I've said it to you in November
5508.48,5513.799999999999, You're tutorial gives people a bunch of fucking stuff to play with and it's overwhelming
5513.799999999999,5518.4, I kind of like the tutorial that seemed like a pretty standard to even paste the tutorial
5518.4,5521.28, It's better that you're totally high. I went to the first tutorial
5521.28,5526.96, I wish I was I was like I did the first level then I skipped to the last level and then I was like
5526.96,5529.16," Okay, cool. I just want to play and I'll play here's the situation"
5529.16,5536.36, Sort of learned by doing on my own and then I'd let in kills. I have a lot of rating the audience and I and I also think you're doing the the tutorials
5536.36,5539.16, A totally service you're thinking I'm under rating the audience
5539.16,5542.92," Well, that's a shock, but anyhow. I know why why do you think he's under rating?"
5542.92,5546.5599999999995, You're saying that they're gonna get overwhelmed by this and that the tutorials are here's the deal
5546.5599999999995,5551.88, I've watched several groups of people play this game and there are certain texts and certain
5551.88,5559.16, Magic that they gravitate towards yeah your testers have perfected ways of utilizing this and you don't give those tools people
5559.16,5565.28, The thing is live them on it like in a leap player in any game is gonna an elite player in any sort of FPS
5565.28,5569.0, It's gonna be someone who uncover something in and like to use it. That's right. I agree
5569.0,5574.04, BXB is a faster way to reloaded. I agree that is shadow on partially and exactly like
5574.04,5580.52, The game is about elite motherfuckers beating the shit of the casuals and driving them off the game and not being what I think is what I think is
5580.52,5581.52, It's fine
5581.52,5586.400000000001, Because our matchmaking is great and we'll get people together that are really like my didn't your match
5586.400000000001,5588.160000000001, Your matchmaking what is your matchmaking?
5588.160000000001,5591.200000000001, I don't know there was a news story about the people like it. You guys know all the
5591.200000000001,5593.64, Shadowrun our matchmaking is great by the way
5593.64,5597.080000000001," Oh, I'm just gonna make out that thesis statement that I won't support it with fat"
5597.080000000001,5602.320000000001," No, those Shadowruns shatterruns one of the games that's coming to Xbox 360 that does have team-based matchmaking"
5602.320000000001,5607.6," Yeah, it's a I mean that's a that's a story from five months ago unlike yours or war unlike well unlike yours work"
5607.6,5614.56, Because they didn't hire more people like I say it. I think on PC that the options are going to be like really important
5614.56,5619.08, I mean if you're enabling server hosts to say turn off like controller use
5619.08,5623.120000000001," So it's able to detect and say hey no, no aim assist or whatever or if they can just control it"
5623.120000000001,5624.96, But there's like no aim assist on this server
5624.96,5629.64, That's a question is that that's something is it gonna be configurable? No no no
5629.64,5632.96, I mean I'm just being honest here like I do like everything. I think it's cool
5632.96,5640.28, But I think that is gonna mean that a big portion of your potential audience on PC is is not what they don't want to play with
5640.56,5642.24, console gamers is that what you mean?
5642.24,5647.28," No, that they're not eventually they're not gonna want to play in an environment where when they when they want to had it"
5647.28,5651.04, Where there's no such thing as aim assist or something that they can't you know turn that off
5651.04,5656.88, I think that's more important than you're probably assuming when you plug a controller into this game it changes the control scheme
5656.88,5659.68," Right, yeah, I mean what to do?"
5660.88,5662.32, Magic magic
5662.32,5667.04, Not sure what you're asking I mean he what he's asking and I can reduce it a little bit simpler is in
5667.04,5670.799999999999, It's good talking small when you pay with the control when you play with the controller there is like
5671.5199999999995,5674.44, obvious auto auto I'm here you still want to come
5674.44,5679.2," So stay aim which is the case, but if you're and that's what he's asking"
5679.2,5685.12, In addition to something like that when you plug in a controller what's fundamentally changing about the way the games play and also a peat in
5685.12,5689.44," Right, yes, that is okay. Let me answer that question. Let me answer that question. Then we'll move on"
5690.24,5691.44, So
5691.5199999999995,5698.879999999999, Nothing to the best of my knowledge nothing with all of all it is is the halo style right
5699.599999999999,5703.919999999999," Sticky MTM or whatever you call it there is stick either. Yeah, that's the release"
5703.919999999999,5705.44, It's a secret
5705.44,5710.719999999999," That's the secret of my halo is good. Yeah, all right. That's why every like Taylor asking me if we made the game good"
5710.719999999999,5715.919999999999," I'm gonna say yes, yes, yes, I mean like it's the best halo players. I mean just speak and pick"
5715.919999999999,5719.12, Talk about what about the accuracy degree within that sticky though
5719.599999999999,5724.0, Like so say you got it you've got to cross her it's about the size of a dime or something you okay
5724.0,5725.599999999999, You put it over a person
5725.599999999999,5730.88, Is it like automatically shooting with without deviation like right where the dot is right at dead
5730.88,5735.599999999999, There is no need on the control of model. There's a dot on the PC model. Okay
5735.599999999999,5739.12, So what is it doing when you're shooting in the middle of that dime? Where's it hitting is it just randomly
5739.12,5745.68, Distributing shots in that circle or is it okay? So the difference between us and halo is that kind of like counterstruck strike
5745.76,5752.88," We have an accuracy model too, right where as you as you move a runner jump or fire right right your accuracy decreases"
5752.88,5758.8," That's why you have to do short controlled bursts in the game. Okay, so within that just on a basic level"
5758.96,5764.16, There's something there's like friction and adhesion right so as you go over somebody with your
5764.96,5770.08, Cross hairs right flat metal radical right you slow down a little bit over the person
5770.56,5773.52, It's pretty subtle and most people don't even notice it at all
5774.0,5780.160000000001," Okay, that's what halo does but we decide where the police will like if they John John gets that"
5781.360000000001,5787.200000000001, John John really gets that there's there's two people in the world that I have absolute faith that have this and that is John and
5787.4400000000005,5792.88, And for the life of me my mind is spacing but the technical director and infinity word gets it also
5793.040000000001,5795.92," Yeah, those are the two people in the world who understand how to make it"
5795.92,5801.76, I mean like I was saying before before we got into this little further like playing halo two at the highest levels is about
5802.24,5807.280000000001, manipulating that that auto aim it's about manipulating that auto aim for something like a swipe
5807.280000000001,5810.96," Snip for everybody else who just use the force and let go, you know everybody else"
5810.96,5815.52," It's exactly where your family else just works and you have fun with the game. Yeah, I mean"
5815.52,5818.8, They're gonna enjoy the game in a completely different way than someone like you know
5819.2,5823.52, myself playing the first halo competitively is gonna enjoy the game and you know a game like
5823.52,5828.400000000001, Shadowrunners seems to be offering at least for the console player both levels of that depth whether
5828.639999999999,5833.44, You know whether they see the nuance and being able to teleport between walls and switch to
5833.759999999999,5838.5599999999995, Reflex in the right situation and whether they seem to grasp that or they just want to run around and fucking glide
5838.879999999999,5839.879999999999, I mean
5839.879999999999,5844.24, It's supporting it's supporting both of that will that create an alienation in the player base
5844.719999999999,5849.92," Ultimately, but that's also contingent on the fact that there is a player base which is the problem that Shadowruns facing"
5849.92,5852.08, It's hard to do it. It's hard to do it. And let's be honest. I mean
5852.08,5855.28," That's you guys know that's a problem, right? What's a problem?"
5855.599999999999,5860.88, A sign of garnishing garnishing garnishing a player base. I joke with you yesterday like I maybe I might not have been with you
5860.88,5862.5599999999995, But I said like be my epic
5862.5599999999995,5867.82, I'm just gonna just want to make sure I mean it's Microsoft gonna slap a halo three single player bait on Shadow
5870.28,5874.82, The crackdown thing like you're laughing but like I'm actually not being funny
5874.82,5879.639999999999, I don't understand you're concerned because we all think this game is good and the expected system model is
5879.639999999999,5883.759999999999, Everybody moves one game of the other. There's nothing that is true. There's no question remind everyone's gonna move to this game
5883.76,5887.4400000000005, Well will you will you have moved off of Mass Effect by the time it's yeah
5887.4400000000005,5892.88, I think you will have it's only twenty hours long. I think it could do well on 360 in ways that like I mean like COD2
5892.88,5896.68," Which is a good game, but the multiplayer is really simple. It is really part of it was timing"
5896.68,5898.68," That's over, but I think I mean"
5898.68,5899.68, It's over a million
5899.68,5903.08, Where you have people like are shifting from one thing to another
5903.08,5905.72, So let's compare it. It's like it's really for me. It's like PCA
5905.72,5907.08, I can't see it like
5907.08,5910.4400000000005, selling like very many get all I don't see a lot of PCA
5910.44,5915.0, I think it's me bigger on 360 just because it's you know captive audience whereas PC gamers of all these choices
5915.0,5922.12," Well, I mean I've talked a lot about Call of Duty and as a matter of fact Activision called me several times about Call of Duty 3 because I was outspoken in"
5922.12,5924.12, 6.5 and
5924.12,5932.759999999999," Good score and claim me. See 1.5. It's good. I did complain that for good. Yeah, but regardless call of duty 3 multiplayer was better than Call of Duty 2 multiplayer"
5932.759999999999,5934.759999999999, But Call of Duty 2 single player was
5935.639999999999,5939.879999999999, Orders of magnitude orders of magnitude of magnitude beyond Call of Duty 3. That's true
5940.44,5942.44, So where does that leave you?
5944.28,5946.28, I
5946.28,5952.2," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not gonna say you're game or you're not gonna say what I heard Luke say was that this is a really good game"
5952.599999999999,5958.919999999999, How are you gonna find your audience really good game? How are you gonna sell it? How are you gonna sell it? MGS sells games at 60 bucks
5959.24,5962.36, Like we talked about a little bit earlier like before we got into any of this
5963.0,5965.0, Other shit
5965.0,5969.24," Actually, so far. It's the one day I will describe what the games about the people on"
5971.08,5974.84, Let me jump here and take this if this is a multiplayer only game for the most part
5974.84,5978.28, I mean there is this part of single player by experience by the way the bots are pretty fucking amazing
5978.28,5982.5," Actually, it is a multiplayer online experience that is 59.99 and if say so"
5982.5,5984.44, We haven't announced pricing by the way
5984.44,5987.16, a lot of all the second I just want to send this out Mark Rain listens a lot
5987.16,5991.32, Mark by the way if you I know you need a lot of people for the gears and unreal teams
5991.4,5995.16, You should totally plumpify because of his Ferrari's looking pretty good to the father
5995.16,5999.719999999999," No, here I want to like I want to keep the focus on what we're talking about really"
5999.719999999999,6001.719999999999, All right good luck with that shit
6001.719999999999,6006.84, But I was gonna I was gonna point to the fact that like there's always rivers that what game like War Hawk is gonna be a download only
6007.639999999999,6012.12, Online only game for PS4 thanks. He just conferred Sony will be calling me
6012.12,6014.679999999999, Garnish like god really gunna shut the fuck up
6015.24,6018.12, Like for 15 seconds no talk right?
6018.28,6025.5199999999995," So if your game is online only yeah, well was there any like maybe we should make this like an online only download game or something like was it"
6025.5199999999995,6028.5599999999995, Somebody floated it. Yeah. Oh sure somebody floated. I mean come on
6028.5599999999995,6033.8, When you've got Xbox live and when you have the games for Windows live service right you think how can we exploit this
6034.2,6036.2, Right we have an advantage over Sony
6036.2,6040.92," I'm gonna be sorry. I'm gonna sound like corporate shell, but it we have an advantage over Sony"
6040.92,6043.4, Right we've got a really good secure online service
6043.5599999999995,6045.5599999999995, Right it's got a lot of great features on it
6045.64,6049.0," This is a great way to do it and yeah, I thought about it pretty hard"
6049.64,6054.92," You know we didn't do it, but yeah, definitely came up so the pricing for the game hasn't been enough"
6054.92,6060.84, But do you guys do recognize that this has to be at a price especially with an IP like Shadow on like we talked about earlier
6060.84,6066.52, And like you said yesterday this version of the game does not have a particularly robust single-player mode
6066.52,6071.4800000000005, And when you said this version and someone it was Sean or Kathleen or I who leaned on you about it
6071.5599999999995,6077.12, And he said well reading to that what you will it's sort of what we talked about at the beginning of the segment with you look over
6077.12,6078.12, Right he'll cover it
6078.12,6083.5599999999995, He's like he's got the he's got the he's got the parachute he's ready to bail out
6083.5599999999995,6088.5199999999995, Look everybody in the marketing department's like oh great put Mitch on a podcast fantastic
6088.5199999999995,6090.5199999999995, Totally stick his entire body
6092.5199999999995,6094.5199999999995, But I'm but yeah
6094.5199999999995,6097.4, Okay with the bill. The game needs to be priced appropriately
6097.4,6100.599999999999, Especially if this is an IP that you want to foster into an RPG
6100.599999999999,6104.759999999999, My first off game suit is his never shipped a game for under 49 99 for Xbox 360
6104.759999999999,6107.48," We've also never shipped a cross platform. Okay, this will be I'm"
6108.04,6113.5599999999995, This bet like this game in order to sell the way that Microsoft needs it to sell this game needs to be 39
6113.5599999999995,6116.599999999999, That's magic price on both platforms and you'll sell a million
6116.599999999999,6120.2," Right, I'm telling you right now you'll sell a million cross platform if it's 40 bucks"
6120.92,6124.4, You heard it here first folks. Well that price point. Oh no no no
6124.4,6126.4, Look you already
6128.4,6132.219999999999, I look at from bad kid for that totally bullshit
6132.719999999999,6136.96, Right point does exist for third party games it has happened by the way there are WMDs out there
6137.44,6139.44, It's one point out
6139.44,6143.74, I'm giving you a marketing strategy is that right this is a wrong for that
6143.74,6144.74," Oh, dude and play"
6146.74,6147.74, Not a
6147.74,6148.74, Not a lot
6148.74,6150.74, What do you pay yeah?
6150.9,6158.0599999999995, Maybe we can do a survey 40 bucks 40 bucks here and have way more people there than it says day this is the most exhaustive and the hardcore interview
6158.0599999999995,6162.26, We've ever had him on appears. I think Luke you have some really good questions in the reader is maybe you should get to those
6162.26,6165.16," Yeah, this will not we have a couple of really good questions"
6165.16,6169.9, We have a couple of uh real quick just to pause and say like like it's cool with Mitch
6169.9,6174.5, The only the only reason we're also like Eddie's is because it's from the beginning from the getko is obvious that
6175.26,6178.679999999999, You're like you're just you're to play it straight. You know I am here to play it straight
6178.68,6182.820000000001," And often in my consciousness know you I mean, I think even a whole like I would be"
6182.820000000001,6187.860000000001, I would be inside believe me maybe for you know for for for guess like you to come on the jeep
6187.860000000001,6191.9400000000005, This is where I've him GFW radio you come on our show because you know when I mean
6191.9400000000005,6195.780000000001, There's a huge difference between someone come on and they're and they're reading from the prepared material
6195.780000000001,6202.16, They're staying on message and so and so forth. So like aside from all the fun and the tension and the caddiness like I mean like it's like
6202.16,6203.4400000000005, There's a thanks in their man
6203.4400000000005,6205.4400000000005, Thanks
6205.44,6207.44, How you out we were gonna
6207.719999999999,6209.0599999999995," Show us a mask. Yeah, Mitch"
6209.7,6211.7, Appreciate your candor. Oh
6211.7,6215.599999999999, So I got more where that comes from that from the boards a couple of questions that were
6216.839999999999,6222.44, appropriate one went when we touched on a minute ago or actually in the first segment that we did finish
6223.16,6225.16, What about the art?
6225.16,6227.16, Does your art style wise the art?
6227.16,6229.94, I mean look dude it looks sort of sort of like
6229.94,6230.94, Mark McDonald's
6230.94,6232.94," Yes, you know"
6232.94,6234.94, You know what honestly
6235.219999999999,6236.719999999999, Do sort of a little bit
6236.719999999999,6238.719999999999," Yeah, yes"
6240.719999999999,6245.24, That's a Mark said that he did he's at the Bahamas right now. He's like you guys have a match from fast on this week
6246.24,6251.759999999999, There's no good mark in pressure than to wave my hands on my head like this and but no one can see it
6251.759999999999,6254.04, But he's like he's asking about the troll dolls
6254.04,6256.04, I don't know
6256.04,6258.379999999999, I was playing yesterday I didn't see any troll dolls
6258.38,6260.38, I don't know
6260.38,6265.42, Everybody that gives you advice on what to ask me does the bunk hits before they send you the message
6265.42,6267.58," They've been playing flow, but I think"
6267.58,6272.66, People are talking about not so I mean in addition to the characters is like the level design
6272.66,6274.38," Yeah, it looks like perfect dark levels are golden"
6274.38,6279.34, It's a little bit of a utility little sparkly utility little sparkles. There's not a lot of furniture
6279.34,6280.62, And I like that
6280.62,6283.46, I was from counter strike that's true. So that take that as a huge
6283.46,6285.46, It's a huge
6285.46,6287.46, It's a huge
6287.46,6289.46, Number one
6289.46,6294.46, Is that there is not a lot of furniture in there. That's absolutely true. That's not art. That's design
6294.46,6303.26, We did it on purpose from a design point of view not an art point of view because you don't want to get a hung up on a chair when you're backing up to try and shoot somebody
6303.26,6307.18, You just don't want to so we just remove it. Okay. That's the truth. All right
6307.9,6311.54, What you know if it look it is why you fucking giggling over
6311.54,6313.54, I
6313.54,6316.54, He's tickling up self on the table
6316.54,6321.14, He's just a bush else to create a gravity gun and then you're able to manipulate or physical objects
6323.54,6327.54, I actually did it on my my legs. He's Peter later
6327.54,6332.54, Is that right? A little bit like totally hot. Thanks. Do you want to feel it? No really feeling everything
6332.54,6338.54, But they're true to the shadow run like legacy
6338.54,6341.54," You know, that's when you play gentlemen like those are what I was like like for real"
6342.54,6349.54, Is that how do you feel about that? I feel about that. I feel that the RPG art was all over the board all over the board
6349.54,6358.54," I used to write RPGs. I know hard PG art is made. That's it. Every basically. Yeah, and basically what you do is you pay him like 250 bucks"
6358.54,6364.54, For a piece of art they do it as fast as they cancel it. They can get multiple 250 dollar increments between tattoos
6364.54,6366.54, You know
6366.54,6368.54, There's no
6368.54,6370.54, There is no
6370.54,6378.54, RPG art is so RPG I'm talking about paper and pencil RPG right you do it. You there's no defined art style for shadow run shadow
6378.54,6385.54, Existed for years and years and if you open up those books elves looks like something different on every page trolls look like something different on every page
6385.54,6395.54, We chose what we liked that's really what it was well wait let me let me say one more thing on that we chose what we liked and we also chose what we thought differentiated them
6395.54,6401.54, Insilawette from each other for differentiation so that you know that guy's healing out a combat
6401.54,6405.54, You know if he's an elf or he's a troll and he's gonna harden so did you worry about this?
6405.54,6411.54," I think you have like 500,000 more polygons each character to make them look like yours or work characters because that wasn't like you're not about these characters"
6411.54,6413.54," Look at it. Yeah, I've been sponsored that too"
6413.54,6421.54, And that is that I think yours were a great looking game. I think the size of their maps are substantially different than the size of the shadow on map
6421.54,6428.54, What we're doing in shadow on with the verticality and the be and to be able to glide over the battlefield and teleport through and all that stuff you can do
6428.54,6432.3," We have it's No, three we have it's no real three if you say emerging game plan"
6432.3,6432.82, I'm gonna come on
6432.82,6434.62," No, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just know what I was going to say"
6435.34,6437.34," Obviously, oh god, here we go"
6437.34,6445.84," No, but if you can do all the stuff in your booting summoning trees and summoning creatures and having 16 players and doing it at frame rate"
6445.84,6447.16, It's a technical achievement.
6447.16,6450.2, I would say the thing that you touch on that's the most important is
6450.2,6453.88, at 16 players with like that level of...
6453.88,6455.8, With a combination of AI and...
6455.8,6457.4400000000005, We've got level of detail.
6457.4400000000005,6460.4400000000005, So what limitations does peer to peer versus having hosted
6460.4400000000005,6461.8, dedicated servers put on you?
6464.8,6466.4400000000005, It's a heavy question.
6466.4400000000005,6468.04, We're going to have hosted a server by...
6468.04,6469.08," No, we're going to have a PC."
6469.08,6470.8, You can do dedicated server on PC.
6470.8,6471.28, Okay.
6471.28,6472.8," Actually, you could probably join them on..."
6472.8,6473.28, Could I?
6473.28,6473.96, Could I?
6473.96,6474.8, Probably.
6474.8,6475.8, Probably because...
6475.8,6479.24," Well, yeah, why don't have the PC guys dedicate all your servers."
6479.24,6481.4800000000005," That's what I was going to say, like the PC guys dedicate their servers"
6481.4800000000005,6482.96, you facilitate live anywhere.
6482.96,6484.96," Play, I haven't dedicated their servers."
6484.96,6487.28, That's why we're going to do so confident that you're going to have
6487.28,6490.4800000000005, that many PC people there that are willing to pay a hundred bucks a month for
6490.4800000000005,6491.4800000000005, their client to have that server.
6491.4800000000005,6492.4800000000005, It's not going to be that...
6492.4800000000005,6493.4800000000005, It's going to be free.
6493.4800000000005,6494.4800000000005, Oh.
6494.4800000000005,6495.96, Telling that's going to be free.
6495.96,6496.96, We're making magic now.
6496.96,6497.96, But that would actually...
6497.96,6498.96," Yeah, that's a good question."
6498.96,6500.360000000001, We're also going to design our tutorials.
6500.360000000001,6501.360000000001, Stripping off the...
6501.360000000001,6503.360000000001, Stripping off the audio is a question to real.
6503.36,6506.96," Like, why not have dedicated servers, but you just put that burden on the PC side."
6506.96,6509.48, And then the Xbox players get to play.
6509.48,6511.4," Well, there was a way way back."
6511.4,6516.04," I mean, to jump in, there was a way in Rainbow Six III for Xbox."
6516.04,6518.16, You could actually dedicate your Xbox.
6518.16,6519.16, You couldn't play it.
6519.16,6520.639999999999, You could dedicate your server.
6520.639999999999,6523.88," It's like, I could come to work and dedicate my Xbox Live account, which I'm not giving"
6523.88,6524.88, out on the show.
6524.88,6526.88," Yeah, it's good call."
6526.88,6530.679999999999, But you're not going to be a pretty self-sagrifying motherfucker to do that though.
6530.679999999999,6531.679999999999, Yeah.
6531.92,6532.92," Yeah, I gotta go to work."
6532.92,6535.92, I'm going to leave on my Xbox and keep someone who's nice people when to play games.
6535.92,6537.72, And here's my email address and Microsoft too.
6537.72,6539.400000000001," Yeah, I'm still gates."
6539.400000000001,6543.6," But I mean, dedicated servers are something that has come up more and more and more."
6543.6,6544.6, It's mentioned.
6544.6,6548.0," Because PS3, first party games, at least, are doing dedicated servers."
6548.0,6553.16, Which is one of the absolute best things about PlayStation Network and about resistance.
6553.16,6554.16, And you know what?
6554.16,6555.16, Wait a minute.
6555.16,6556.64, It's only the number one thing to mean.
6556.64,6558.16, You don't need to pay for it.
6558.16,6559.16, Yeah.
6559.16,6560.16, I don't have shame.
6560.16,6561.5599999999995," But I mean, that is a concern."
6561.5599999999995,6563.639999999999, Is that something that you guys have a lobby with?
6563.639999999999,6566.639999999999," With Microsoft to say, why don't we get dedicated servers for this title?"
6566.639999999999,6567.639999999999, I don't have to lobby.
6567.639999999999,6568.639999999999, I'm doing it.
6568.639999999999,6569.639999999999, You're getting dedicated servers for your title.
6569.639999999999,6570.639999999999," Oh, hold on."
6570.639999999999,6572.28, There's two different things.
6572.28,6576.88, Supporting dedicated servers is different than us providing service.
6576.88,6578.5199999999995," Who's providing you, probably?"
6578.5199999999995,6580.92," No, it's providing dedicated servers for resistance."
6580.92,6581.92, Sony.
6581.92,6583.5199999999995," Hey, we're a quick change."
6583.5199999999995,6584.5199999999995, Just like Bill.
6584.5199999999995,6585.5199999999995, I'm so Michael.
6585.5199999999995,6586.5199999999995," Michael, where's the money?"
6586.5199999999995,6587.5199999999995," Where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the, where's the,"
6587.52,6588.52, where's servers?
6588.52,6589.88," I'm like, you're gonna ask Michael."
6589.88,6592.72," Yeah, let's ask the PR law to dedicate some servers."
6592.72,6594.52," We're not like, we're not, we're not, we're not like, we're not, we're not like,"
6594.52,6595.52," yeah, that's his call."
6595.52,6596.52, No question about it.
6596.52,6597.52, We're not waiting.
6597.52,6598.52, No hold on a second.
6598.52,6599.52," I mean, Mark for you here."
6599.52,6600.52, As he had a couple of drinks.
6600.52,6601.52," Who, Michael?"
6601.52,6602.52, Yeah.
6602.52,6603.52, Yeah.
6603.52,6604.52, He's been invited.
6604.52,6605.52, Where the servers come out.
6605.52,6606.52, You know what I'm talking about.
6606.52,6609.52," There you know what, there's a big great example of how to demonstrate"
6609.52,6611.52," Microsoft's, you server architecture."
6611.52,6613.52, Microsoft is going to roll out news over architecture.
6613.52,6616.52," Unfortunately for the masses, it wouldn't be with Shadow."
6616.52,6617.52, It's all I'm saying.
6617.52,6620.52, It's probably going to have to happen for underal tournament three.
6620.52,6622.52, How are you going to be able to pull that shit?
6622.52,6623.52, All I'm saying is that a hit.
6623.52,6628.52, All I'm saying is if Microsoft is going to roll out dedicated servers for their online
6628.52,6630.52," multiplayer games, it will not be with a title."
6630.52,6632.52, Hello three dedicated servers confirmed.
6632.52,6635.52," I was just saying, again, they shut."
6635.52,6636.52, This is a hell of a shell.
6636.52,6637.52, You got a power feeling.
6637.52,6639.52," Speaking of things, I think we should get the reader questions."
6639.52,6640.52, All right.
6640.52,6641.52, So this is real important.
6641.52,6644.52," Like I, and I'll be quite, I promise I'll be quite for no, no, no, no quiet."
6645.52,6651.52," But Shane, like, I mean, one thing I do, I see the, I don't listen to show so much, but I see like all the messageboard or whatever."
6651.52,6657.52," But it's like that there's a lot of fightin over cables and deals and values, but I just want to say Shane for a dude"
6657.52,6663.52, who's got everything you can ever want and doesn't have to make either or choices who it's always about you get all you want.
6663.52,6670.52," You care so much for the dude who's got to go pawn his ring to get himself a, get himself one single console."
6670.52,6673.52, I don't really care for that guy.
6673.52,6675.52, I want you to make the right decision man.
6675.52,6677.52," I know you're taking, I know you're giving blood today."
6677.52,6679.52, I spent a lot of you going down to ebg.
6679.52,6680.52, I spent a bit of people.
6680.52,6682.52, So I spent five years with an ebi.
6682.52,6683.52, I've met average Joe a lot.
6683.52,6684.52," I know, I know what he thinks."
6684.52,6687.52, I know the guy that we're talking about the guy that returned final fancy because he couldn't read.
6687.52,6688.52, I met off of you screen.
6688.52,6691.52," Yeah, the dude returned from RSS seven because he didn't know you had to read the blade of the game."
6691.52,6693.52, It's just like why the fuck did I pay to come on?
6693.52,6694.52," No, this is awesome."
6694.52,6695.52, Okay.
6695.52,6699.52," So one question that I do want to get to from the readers and the, the question that we talked about a little bit."
6699.52,6700.52, I talked about a little bit earlier.
6700.52,6701.52, Wait did he answer the art thing?
6701.52,6702.52, Yes.
6702.52,6703.52," Yeah, we're really, we're done with it."
6703.52,6705.52," Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about."
6705.52,6708.52," I think answer, answer was they don't actually have a concept artist and find."
6708.52,6709.52," No, that's it."
6709.52,6710.52, Answer that actually.
6710.52,6713.52," Yeah, no, it's like completely blind."
6713.52,6718.52," The answer was actually going to, if you listened when he was talking, which I know is a problem for you sometimes."
6718.52,6719.52, It definitely.
6719.52,6726.52," That they were, they, he's an example of $250 a pop front piece of art and they picked a piece of art that they liked the most and that's a piece of art they ended up rendering and rolling."
6726.52,6727.52, And then does.
6727.52,6728.52," Yeah, yeah, $250."
6728.52,6729.52, That's what he did for the entire.
6729.52,6733.52," And then I'd like to say, you don't want to put too many physical objects in the way they can repeat."
6733.52,6735.52," No, that's completely true."
6735.52,6736.52, That was a valid argument.
6736.52,6737.52, It is.
6737.52,6738.52, Okay.
6738.52,6739.52, It is.
6739.52,6740.52, But also I think that looks great.
6740.52,6746.52," Next, Boston College fan asked a question that is actually, I remember this, I think it was on Discovery Channel."
6746.52,6747.52, A whole special about it.
6747.52,6752.52, Can you ask him to tell the story behind the crimson skies development hiatus?
6752.52,6753.52, Sort of.
6753.52,6754.52, What development hiatus?
6754.52,6756.52, I remember that Discovery Channel special with odd world stranger.
6756.52,6757.52, Yeah.
6757.52,6758.52, That was a good one.
6758.52,6759.52, Is that sort of my dimension?
6759.52,6763.52," No, there was a, there was a special way back and I sure, years ago."
6763.52,6769.52," I was a, but there was a special about how crimson skies went through like sort of two phases of development."
6769.52,6772.52, The first phase produced a game that was ultimately not up to Microsoft's.
6772.52,6774.52," They reset the, you went to the project."
6774.52,6775.52," Yeah, and in the project."
6775.52,6776.52, Absolutely.
6776.52,6778.52," Like, I would like to talk a bit a little bit like this."
6778.52,6779.52, That's not a hiatus.
6779.52,6780.52, That's hard work.
6780.52,6781.52," It's a big, no way to make it."
6781.52,6782.52, It wasn't a hiatus.
6782.52,6784.52," I mean, he was you being told that you suck."
6784.52,6785.52," No, not true at all."
6785.52,6786.52," Well, no, not true at all."
6786.52,6788.52," But like, that's the thing like, let's talk about that really quickly."
6788.52,6792.52, You just sort of monologue about it because this is something that this particular user wanted to know.
6792.52,6794.52, And I think that it's pretty interesting.
6794.52,6795.52, I agree.
6795.52,6796.52, It's interesting.
6796.52,6798.52, And I'm happy to talk about it.
6798.52,6799.52, Right.
6799.52,6800.52, I'm happy to talk about it.
6800.52,6801.52, I'll tell you.
6801.52,6802.52, V-truth.
6802.52,6803.52, Good.
6803.52,6804.52, What's so happened?
6804.52,6805.52, That is this.
6805.52,6807.52," First of all, the crimson skies for the PC."
6807.52,6808.52, First one.
6808.52,6809.52, The first one.
6809.52,6811.52, Because a lot of our listeners are going to know hi road to revenge.
6811.52,6812.52, That's right.
6812.52,6813.52, That's correct.
6813.52,6814.52, You've done your homework.
6814.52,6815.52, That's one of you.
6815.52,6819.52," The, the deal is on the PC Lee designer was John Howard, right?"
6819.52,6821.52," Fassigai who did Chetaran, right?"
6821.52,6823.52, I thought that was a very cool game on the PC.
6823.52,6826.52, I was involved in that in the very earliest phases.
6826.52,6835.52," Then, um, well, Fassig was off doing mech matter, mech warrior, mech warrior mercenaries, you know, milking the franchise."
6835.52,6836.52, Got it.
6836.52,6837.52, Carnot.
6837.52,6838.52, So negatively.
6838.52,6839.52, Why is it negative?
6839.52,6840.52, There's doing our job.
6841.52,6842.52, You've never heard of the last one.
6842.52,6843.52," Yes, on the show again."
6843.52,6846.52," It's a good listen sometimes, Gondon."
6846.52,6847.52, Let's practice.
6847.52,6848.52," So, a couple of minutes."
6848.52,6852.52," So, while we're doing that, they took the crimson skies IP."
6852.52,6858.52, They gave it to a different studio within Microsoft game studios at the time called studio
6858.52,6860.52, Y slash ironworks.
6860.52,6862.52, Just let it go.
6862.52,6867.52," And they said, make crimson skies because at the time the vice president and charge of Microsoft"
6867.52,6870.52, games was a big crimson skies fast-eimed to Ed Freeze.
6870.52,6872.52, And he really wanted a crimson skieskin.
6872.52,6873.52, He loved crimson skies.
6873.52,6874.52, He loved the world.
6874.52,6875.52, He loved the gameplay.
6875.52,6877.52, And he wanted them to make a crimson skies.
6877.52,6880.52," These are the guys that are right now at airtight games, right?"
6880.52,6882.52, The detectors.
6882.52,6883.52, Easy.
6883.52,6885.52," If they're making the cock and a chosen sequel, no, right?"
6885.52,6886.52, Oh.
6886.52,6889.52, I think I'm making a cow thing.
6889.52,6891.52, I actually don't have to pee at the next place.
6891.52,6894.52, It's all about the action game based about the fatalist.
6894.52,6895.52," I'm done, ping."
6896.52,6899.52," And just for the record, I hear that the game they're working on, that was very good."
6899.52,6900.52, Right?
6900.52,6901.52, I'm done.
6901.52,6902.52, They went off.
6902.52,6905.52," They started working on crimson skies, right?"
6905.52,6907.52," Two, two, or two, or two."
6907.52,6909.52," High road to revenge, right?"
6909.52,6913.52, Brought it to E3 and had a lukewarm reception.
6913.52,6919.52," Came back, Ed Freeze re-ordered that team into Fassa Studio."
6919.52,6921.52," Said, finish this game."
6921.52,6922.52, Make it a hit.
6922.52,6923.52, Right?
6923.52,6930.52," What we did then was we added some developers to that team, specifically our designers."
6930.52,6933.52, And that's how we got the game that we have today.
6933.52,6936.52," So it was a bit of a reset, but it wasn't like a total reset."
6936.52,6937.52," You didn't like start from scratch, right?"
6937.52,6938.52," No, no, not at all."
6938.52,6939.52, Change direction a little bit.
6939.52,6940.52," No, a changed direction."
6940.52,6943.52, More than a little bit in two ways.
6943.52,6946.52," One was Jim Deal, who was the project lead."
6946.52,6952.52," I think came up with a very good idea, which was that you could get out of a plane"
6952.52,6955.52," and get into a turret and you couldn't jump around and do different things, right?"
6955.52,6956.52, Added that.
6956.52,6962.52," Then the design team on the controls, because the flight model, I thought, needed improvement."
6962.52,6966.52," This, sorry, wasn't my thought, but I think needed improvement and was proved out."
6966.52,6972.52," You know, they came in, they improved the flight model, then they added in the special moves and stuff like that."
6972.52,6974.52, And that's how we got to where we are today.
6974.52,6977.52," So a complete reset, I wouldn't say that at all."
6977.52,6980.52," You know, but you know, added some stuff."
6980.52,6982.52, And it was for the best though.
6982.52,6983.52, Yeah.
6983.52,6984.52," Oh, totally."
6984.52,6987.52, That the threat of a complete reset with Shadow Run after the E3.
6987.52,6988.52," I mean, because you said that."
6988.52,6989.52," No, no, no."
6989.52,6994.52," Someone higher up was responsible for saying, let's show this probably before some of the people wanted it to be shown."
6994.52,7000.52," I wonder, like, the reason was just for, they were eager to start promoting it or they wanted the litmus test where they said,"
7000.52,7002.52," Okay, maybe this needs to, no, no, no, not at all."
7002.52,7003.52, Nothing like that.
7003.52,7009.52," It was, it's more about we're announcing the life anywhere vision, right?"
7009.52,7012.52, This is the cornerstone of the life anywhere vision.
7012.52,7016.52," You know, it's sort of the, the germ of the life anywhere vision, right?"
7016.52,7018.52, And so we're going to do that.
7018.52,7020.52," You know, I'm not sure."
7020.52,7026.52," I think people thought that the gameplay would, you know, win out, right?"
7026.52,7027.52, So there it is.
7027.52,7029.52, So there was no threat of a reset.
7029.52,7034.52," You know, it was just a matter of me going back to the team going, okay."
7034.52,7036.52," You know, we got a report card."
7036.52,7039.52, And so we're not going to run around like chickens with our heads cut off.
7039.52,7040.52, It seems useless for you.
7040.52,7044.52," It seems like the whole E3 thing would have been entirely useless for you because you know,"
7044.52,7048.52," I mean, the gameplay stuff would have been good, but that was tainted because people were,"
7048.52,7053.52," There's perception was, was distorted by the emphasis on what, how the game looked."
7053.52,7058.52," And you wanted, at that point, like, by your own admission, you see, all we cared about is the gameplay itself."
7058.52,7063.52," Insofar as you could separate that from the presentation, and you just wanted feedback on how it played,"
7063.52,7066.52," but it's like you couldn't really get that fairly because everyone's busy saying like,"
7066.52,7069.52, You just don't look like a three-changed game.
7069.52,7070.52," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
7070.52,7071.52," Yeah, it was awesome."
7071.52,7075.52," It was so, like, why was it useful for you?"
7075.52,7077.52," Do you want to say, why was it useful for me?"
7077.52,7078.52, I don't know.
7078.52,7081.52," You know, I don't know how to respond to that exactly."
7081.52,7084.52, E3 is a milestone in game development.
7084.52,7088.52," In other words, what we like to do, you know, you do milestones and a project."
7088.52,7091.52," All right, milestone in like pulling out the smoke and chains and mirrors too."
7091.52,7092.52," I mean, depending on the game."
7092.52,7096.52," For some, and that's an interesting point because we refuse to do that, right?"
7096.52,7103.52," Fassa historically has never done smoke and mirrors, and that in a way can be our downfall, right?"
7103.52,7108.52," And that we insisted on the game running at frame rate on the Florida D3,"
7108.52,7110.52, even though other games don't necessarily do that.
7110.52,7113.52, We insisted that our gameplay be smooth and that it worked great.
7113.52,7118.52," And so, at times you sacrifice your art to make sure that the play is as smooth as it needs to be"
7118.52,7120.52, to show off the rest of this stuff.
7120.52,7123.52," And so, that's one of the reasons why the art was the way it was."
7123.52,7127.52, We've kept the frame rate and the gameplay solid through the whole development.
7127.52,7129.52, And art suffered because of that.
7129.52,7134.52," Now, as we get more frame rate back, then art rises up."
7134.52,7135.52, And that's what you're seeing.
7135.52,7138.52, That's exactly what happened to the frame rate.
7138.52,7139.52, It's another frame.
7139.52,7140.52, It's a measure.
7140.52,7142.52, It just seems like somebody holding this down.
7142.52,7145.52," E3 was, E3's always been just about your bullshit."
7145.52,7149.52," It just seems like, okay, well, you won't have to worry about E3 much longer."
7149.52,7152.52, But don't back to that thing about the milestone.
7152.52,7158.52, There is nothing that motivates game developers in my opinion more than showing their stuff.
7158.52,7159.52, Vertical slice.
7159.52,7160.52, You love it.
7160.52,7161.52," No, I don't mean it that way."
7161.52,7166.52, I just mean vertical slice for the listeners because there's going to be some security in it.
7166.52,7167.52," Yeah, sorry."
7167.52,7168.52, Let's show on.
7168.52,7169.52, Let's show on.
7169.52,7170.52, It's real quick.
7170.52,7176.52, Would you put together a snippet of whatever five minutes or whatever segment of gameplay that's indicative of what crisis
7176.52,7177.52, is the game?
7177.52,7182.52," Yeah, well, crisis, the last hand's on thing from CES and the games for Windows event were vertical slices."
7182.52,7183.52, This is what it was like.
7183.52,7187.52," As I was saying, we'll find out just by like, you know, using speed jumping out of the map and then you look and they're like,"
7187.52,7188.52, Right.
7188.52,7192.52," The thing is, we see a really good vertical slice that doesn't mean there's actually a good game."
7192.52,7196.52," And how life, how life too, the part that leaked Fistown was a vertical slice."
7196.52,7197.52," Right, Bryce."
7197.52,7198.52, We still love you.
7198.52,7199.52, Yeah.
7199.52,7201.52," But it been, but anyway, yes."
7201.52,7203.52," So vertical slices, you put together what could,"
7203.52,7204.52, maybe just a bunch of smoke here.
7204.52,7205.52, Show off.
7205.52,7206.52," It's an absolutely, right."
7206.52,7212.52," And you always know, you know, it's a vertical slice when one dude, when the game developers"
7212.52,7213.52, representatives are playing it.
7213.52,7216.52, And every video you seize them doing the exact same thing.
7216.52,7219.52," Like, crisis videos, you look, you're like, this is a game where they're saying you can go left."
7219.52,7221.52," If you want to go left, you can go right if you want to go right."
7221.52,7226.52," Now it's always like going left, but that's what we've left it within like two millimeters of the same path."
7226.52,7227.52," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
7227.52,7228.52," Yeah, yeah."
7228.52,7229.52," But anyway, that verticals."
7229.52,7230.52, And what did we show it?
7230.52,7231.52, We showed it a three.
7231.52,7233.52," We showed a complete level, right."
7233.52,7234.52, Which is pretty much the tech.
7234.52,7235.52, It was awesome.
7235.52,7236.52," Yeah, it was awesome."
7236.52,7237.52, It was awesome.
7237.52,7238.52, It was awesome.
7238.52,7239.52, It was awesome.
7239.52,7240.52, It was awesome.
7240.52,7241.52, It was awesome.
7241.52,7242.52, It was awesome.
7242.52,7243.52, It was awesome.
7243.52,7244.52, And it was balanced.
7244.52,7245.52, And it ran it frame.
7245.52,7246.52, You know what?
7246.52,7247.52, We covered the tail out of the thing.
7247.52,7248.52, Jesus.
7248.52,7249.52," And the man, I'm sick of shit."
7249.52,7250.52, It's got a bit old on there.
7250.52,7251.52, The Luke Smith.
7251.52,7253.52," Luke, has the clothes."
7253.52,7256.52," Oh, that's the, I haven't even described the damn game."
7256.52,7258.52," Oh, no, no, no, no."
7258.52,7259.52, Let him describe the game.
7260.52,7262.52, So I think we're all going to say when we're preparing.
7262.52,7264.52, It's an LL of Senator V.
7264.52,7267.52, It doesn't merge and swear to God.
7267.52,7270.52, I have never said a merchant in this picture.
7270.52,7272.52, I'm actually piano on the show.
7272.52,7273.52, Absolutely.
7273.52,7275.52, And I will open my mouth and take it.
7275.52,7276.52, Jesus.
7276.52,7277.52, What's the matter?
7277.52,7278.52, I'm waiting.
7278.52,7279.52, So.
7279.52,7282.52, Shadowfront is a team based multiplayer.
7282.52,7285.52, First person shooter for expats.
7285.52,7288.52, 360 and windows vista that you can play cross platform.
7288.52,7293.52, And that means that people on vista and people on 360 can play together.
7293.52,7294.52, Starting there.
7294.52,7297.52," It's a round based game, which means that each round you can buy new weapons, new tech, new magic."
7297.52,7301.52, Some people described it as an RPG on speed.
7301.52,7305.52, And I've used that word myself because I kind of dig it where you actually
7305.52,7307.52, modify your character round by your character.
7307.52,7310.52, And I've used that word myself because I kind of dig it where you actually
7310.52,7312.52, modify your character round by your character.
7312.52,7315.52, And I've used that word myself because I kind of dig it where you actually
7315.52,7320.52, modify your character round by round to make them into the character that you want to play.
7320.52,7323.52," You can play one of four races, elf dwarf, troll or human."
7323.52,7325.52, Each one has their own innate abilities.
7325.52,7329.52," And then on top of that, the abilities that you add during the game."
7329.52,7334.52, And each of those abilities have nothing to do with offensive capabilities.
7334.52,7339.52, It's about getting the drop on the enemy outsmarting and outplaying the enemy.
7339.52,7341.52, And then you put your crossers on him any blow away.
7341.52,7342.52, I'll stop there for now.
7342.52,7345.52, And you've done that works only because it's too smart for everybody.
7345.52,7351.52," Well, I think it's fair that 40 minutes in this segment and he gets to describe his game."
7351.52,7352.52, What my question.
7352.52,7353.52, 40.
7353.52,7358.52, And you're you will not look at Michael and all during this question.
7358.52,7360.52, You will not look over to.
7360.52,7361.52," Oh, yeah."
7361.52,7362.52," Yeah, it's pretty."
7362.52,7363.52, This isn't.
7363.52,7364.52, He doesn't exist.
7364.52,7365.52, It's just you and I.
7365.52,7366.52, It is.
7366.52,7368.52, And these three other dudes can defend the tender moment.
7368.52,7372.52, The game is supposed to ship in within Microsoft's fiscal year.
7372.52,7375.52," Right now, cracked on to ship forces next."
7375.52,7379.52, Then Mass Effect and then Shadow Run.
7379.52,7381.52, What's next for Fasa?
7381.52,7384.52, Are you guys is what you guys are working on next already determined?
7384.52,7387.52, Or is it we're doing crimson skies next?
7387.52,7390.52, Or is it we're doing the Shadow Run RPG?
7390.52,7397.52, Or is it what's next for the studio is based on the sales for this project that we're concluding now?
7397.52,7401.52, What's next for the studio is based on the success of Shadow.
7401.52,7404.52, Would you like to do an RPG?
7404.52,7405.52, Me personally?
7405.52,7406.52, Yeah.
7406.52,7407.52," Yeah, absolutely."
7407.52,7409.52, Take a place in the Shadow Run universe.
7409.52,7410.52," Sure, why not?"
7410.52,7412.52, I just want to do an RPG.
7412.52,7413.52, Right.
7413.52,7414.52, I've never made one.
7414.52,7417.52, I'm an old school RPG guy of written RPGs.
7417.52,7418.52, Right.
7418.52,7424.52," One of the things, you know, from my careers, I've done a real time strategy game or real time tactical game with mecassault."
7424.52,7427.52, I've done third person action game with mec...
7427.52,7432.52," well, sorry mecassault, what do I say mec a manner for the real time tactical?"
7432.52,7433.52, I've done the third person shooter.
7433.52,7435.52, I've done a first person shooter.
7435.52,7436.52, I wouldn't mind doing an RPG.
7436.52,7441.52, I don't like to do the same thing twice if I can get away with it personally.
7441.52,7452.52," As a crimson skies fan, is it am I going to see a crimson sky's game this generation during this console cycle coming to my Xbox 360?"
7452.52,7454.52, I can't promise you that.
7454.52,7457.52, Would you like to be able to promise me that?
7457.52,7458.52, Yeah.
7458.52,7459.52, Yeah.
7459.52,7462.52, I was the original lead designer and crimson skies.
7462.52,7463.52," So yeah, I would love to."
7463.52,7465.52," You know, I wish I could have made the game."
7465.52,7466.52, I wrote the first design.
7466.52,7467.52, I was surprised.
7467.52,7469.52," I wrote about the, I wrote about the real question."
7469.52,7471.52," Or instead of like, we're going to get a sequel for this."
7471.52,7472.52, We're going to get a sequel for this.
7472.52,7475.52," What about like, do you have any unfulfilled dreams as a developer"
7475.52,7477.52," that the way that things work,"
7477.52,7479.52, you have prevented you forever from doing?
7479.52,7484.52," And you know that like you have so many people above you that you'd have to convince that this is worth,"
7484.52,7485.52," you know, financing or anything."
7485.52,7488.52," I mean, do you have anything like that that if, if, if at this moment,"
7488.52,7490.52," so it's okay, go make the game you want."
7490.52,7492.52, Would it be a sequel or would it be something else on your own?
7492.52,7495.52," The game, if I could do anything, no, the game wouldn't be a sequel, though."
7495.52,7497.52, There's a lot of things to add to Shadowroom.
7497.52,7498.52, We haven't touched the matrix.
7498.52,7500.52, We haven't touched the Astral plane.
7500.52,7502.52, There's all sorts of things you can do in that.
7502.52,7504.52," I'd be totally happy to do them, right?"
7504.52,7506.52, Would that be my dream game?
7506.52,7510.52, The problem is that my dream game would probably be a boutique game.
7510.52,7511.52, You know what I mean?
7511.52,7512.52, Shadowroom dating sim.
7512.52,7514.52, Awesome.
7514.52,7516.52, My daughters would love that.
7516.52,7518.52," You know, so can I say that?"
7518.52,7520.52," No, you know, what's my dream game?"
7520.52,7522.52, It doesn't matter what it's sell.
7522.52,7523.52, I would love it.
7523.52,7528.52," I think it's safe to say, based off the response that I had after I visited your studio"
7528.52,7532.52," and through out a rumor that I saw maybe some crimson skies, you know,"
7532.52,7534.52, concept art around the studio.
7534.52,7536.52," You're a rebel, Razzar."
7536.52,7537.52, I would never be.
7537.52,7539.52, We only talk about it on the show.
7539.52,7540.52, Yeah.
7540.52,7541.52, It's a little place you get it.
7541.52,7543.52, I appreciate the fact that you like the game and you want to see more of it.
7543.52,7545.52, That's incredibly cool.
7545.52,7546.52, I want you to appreciate that.
7546.52,7548.52," I want to see more of it, too."
7548.52,7551.52," As I sent to you via email, as you know, because I sent it to you,"
7551.52,7554.52, there are plenty of folks who reiterated that out there.
7554.52,7556.52, So there's lots of people who are very interesting crimson skies.
7556.52,7560.52, I hope for you that there's a lot of people who out there who can dig in the shadow run
7560.52,7562.52, and then it can find its audience.
7562.52,7565.52, I hope it's priced appropriately.
7565.52,7568.52, That's the most important thing about this IP period.
7568.52,7572.52," It's like when we talk about NPDs when we come back from the break price,"
7572.52,7574.52, this generation is the ultimate barrier to entry.
7574.52,7577.52," And while we're talking about that in terms of console hardware,"
7577.52,7580.52, it's not exclusive software is also important.
7580.52,7581.52, That's going to be really playing it.
7581.52,7585.52," So if you're listening stick around because when we come back in a minute,"
7585.52,7588.52, NPD numbers galore all the time.
7588.52,7589.52, I love NPD week.
7589.52,7590.52, Oh God.
7590.52,7592.52, It's my favorite time in the month.
7592.52,7593.52, This is very sexy.
7593.52,7595.52, It's like the week that a lady friend wouldn't be on a period.
7595.52,7596.52, Oh God.
7596.52,7597.52, That's right.
7597.52,7598.52, Lucas's tampax.
7598.52,7599.52, He's all set for the NPD numbers.
7599.52,7600.52, So don't be a stranger.
7600.52,7601.52, Hang on.
7601.52,7603.52, I love a flow after this.
7603.52,7604.52, Math.
7604.52,7605.52, And we'll leave it at that.
7605.52,7606.52, We'll be right back.
7606.52,7607.52, We'll be right back.
7611.52,7612.52, Want to know what's new now?

7629.52,7631.52, That was pretty epic.
7631.52,7632.52, Wasn't it man?
7632.52,7634.52, We're in almost two hours.
7634.52,7635.52, We're out.
7635.52,7638.52," If you're watching the time, just stop watching the time and enjoy your commute."
7638.52,7639.52, Listen to the show and have a good time.
7639.52,7640.52, We're back.
7640.52,7641.52, We're ready for news.
7641.52,7642.52, Lucas and PD numbers.
7642.52,7643.52, He's thrilled.
7643.52,7644.52, He had some thoughts.
7644.52,7646.52, Why we were just talking here a moment ago about one thing that happened though.
7646.52,7647.52, You might want to introduce.
7647.52,7648.52," I mean, you know what I want to announce,"
7648.52,7650.52," rather, is that Mitch had to go."
7650.52,7651.52," Yeah, because we ran so long."
7651.52,7654.52, And the dude realized his flight was leaving like 40 minutes.
7654.52,7656.52," So yeah, by the way, he missed his flight."
7656.52,7657.52," Yeah, so."
7657.52,7659.52," So we're all like, I'm sure you can just join me in saying,"
7659.52,7661.52," like, thanks to Mitch, great, great sport."
7661.52,7664.52," Yeah, it was, I mean, though, like he sat there."
7664.52,7669.52," And I think that, uh, I don't think he got to say a whole lot about his game."
7669.52,7671.52, That was like on message.
7671.52,7672.52, I don't think there was much on message.
7672.52,7676.52," So, I mean, you know, but it's welcome to one of yours, by the way."
7676.52,7679.52," If looking back at, you might even want to give the opportunity."
7679.52,7681.52," He looks back on his like, hey, you know, like, or even it,"
7681.52,7684.52," I'm sure in his cab ride, he's probably like, I have a million other things to say."
7684.52,7686.52," It's like, write it up and put, oh, sit on one up somewhere."
7686.52,7688.52," Mitch, he's, I will put it on my personal blog, actually."
7688.52,7690.52," Mitch, if you want to like send it to me, I will."
7690.52,7692.52," If you want people to read it, I'll put it on mine."
7692.52,7693.52, Dude.
7693.52,7694.52, Dude.
7694.52,7695.52, He did it.
7695.52,7696.52, Dick.
7696.52,7698.52," Actually, let's give him his numbers."
7698.52,7701.52," So what I want to start with is NPT, but I want to start with it in the context of"
7701.52,7704.52," Shaderun, another game that's going to be coming to PC."
7704.52,7706.52, Eventually is Gears of War.
7706.52,7707.52, That's no secret.
7707.52,7711.52, There's a secret video floating around one up that we haven't actually unveiled
7711.52,7716.52, the public where a high executive at Microsoft says a year ago now at
7716.52,7720.52," GDC says, GDC of six says, yeah, when Gears of War come to PC,"
7720.52,7723.52," well, the numbers that that you're going to, you're going to expect from a game"
7723.52,7729.52, like Gears on PC is about 1.5 million to epic internal estimates of 5.5 million
7729.52,7730.52, on consoles.
7730.52,7733.52," I think that that number is important when you consider a game like Shaderun,"
7733.52,7736.52," which like Sean talked about, and I would actually agree, especially seeing the many"
7736.52,7740.52, system and listen to sort of like the a little bit of a list.
7740.52,7743.52, I would be pretty damn surprised if Shaderun does 1.5 million.
7743.52,7747.52," No, but that's not what I want people to gravitate towards is that ratio,"
7747.52,7749.52, 5.5 million to 1.5 million.
7749.52,7752.52," I mean, Shaderun's not going to sell like a Gears of War, but, but,"
7752.52,7758.52, Mitch's semi-listless defense of Shaderun on PC sort of confirms that the game
7758.52,7761.52, is a console game for some foremost.
7761.52,7764.52," What else, what else would a game using Halo's lead designer be?"
7764.52,7765.52, Guess what?
7765.52,7766.52, Guess what?
7766.52,7769.52, Halo didn't sell all that fucking well on the PC when Gearboxed out with it.
7769.52,7773.52, And that's great news for all of us that like the play shooters is console shooters.
7773.52,7774.52, It's fucking awesome.
7774.52,7777.52," Right, and yeah, great news for the Luke Smith train."
7777.52,7779.52," And me train, I love it."
7779.52,7783.52," As the PC shooter guy, it's pretty fucking scary to me though for this reason,"
7783.52,7787.52," because you see Quake Wars coming to console, you see crossing."
7787.52,7791.52," I mean, games that are just quintessentially PC-centric are all going console."
7791.52,7795.52," At some point, you were like, because at my whole point was, there's something"
7795.52,7800.52, there are quintessential aspects of a PC shooter that differentiate them from the console.
7800.52,7802.52," And if we lose that, I'm going to be pretty pretty."
7802.52,7806.52, Are you the least bit worried that Luke is going to let Quake Wars get messed up?
7806.52,7807.52, I'm not with him.
7807.52,7808.52, No.
7808.52,7809.52," Okay, so I'm not either."
7809.52,7813.52," But Activision say, say Quake Wars ends up selling better on 360."
7813.52,7815.52, It doesn't matter what the fuck Loki thinks.
7816.52,7817.52, It was Paul Wedge with the least.
7817.52,7818.52, That's a true.
7818.52,7823.52," Right, with Paul Wedge, dude, I've talked about Wedge with twice and the dude, he is not going to let Quake"
7823.52,7824.52, Wars do screwed up.
7824.52,7826.52, Because he got into it because he loves it.
7826.52,7830.52," He's his mother and they made a wolf and standing in the territory, but I mean, at some point,"
7830.52,7834.52," you go where you want your job, you go where the dollars go, you know?"
7834.52,7836.52," Speaking where the dollars are going, is that to the Wii?"
7836.52,7837.52, He's the Wii.
7837.52,7842.52," You know what, you would, you one would say it to the Wii, but based on revenue numbers is not to the Wii."
7842.52,7846.52, General NPDs came out this week when we talked hardware first.
7846.52,7853.52," In the next gen hardware race, next gen Microsoft out sold the Sony PlayStation 3 by Margin of Barely,"
7853.52,7857.52," 294,000 units to 244,000 units."
7857.52,7862.52," Now, one thing to keep in mind is that Microsoft has run on the market a year longer."
7862.52,7866.52," If you compare the numbers between Microsoft's first three months on the market last year,"
7866.52,7870.52," and Sony's first three months on the market this year, guess who wins Shane?"
7870.52,7871.52, Not sure.
7871.52,7873.52," Guess what, it's Sony by 50,000 units."
7873.52,7874.52," Oh, but that was a thing."
7874.52,7882.52," It's like, does that really matter when the Wii sells a whopping 436,000 units during the month of January?"
7882.52,7885.52," Well, I guess it depends on how much you're catching up."
7885.52,7887.52," Well, the thing is, is like, how much are you catching up?"
7887.52,7891.52," And the other thing is like, I think that what these hardware numbers prove is,"
7891.52,7897.52, ultimately that the most important barrier to entry and what we know as gen now is price.
7897.52,7899.52, There are other factors to consider here.
7899.52,7904.52," Like, we has this amazing zeitgeist among mainstream people like soccer moms and grandmothers"
7904.52,7905.52, and shit.
7905.52,7908.52," And if you look at the sales figures this month, Zelda was not selling like it was in the season."
7908.52,7911.52," Well, I'm going to talk specifically about that because we've got a story up on one"
7911.52,7913.52, up today about it.
7913.52,7916.52, Zelda sold over the on the Wii actually.
7916.52,7917.52, I want to be specific.
7917.52,7918.52," Like 1808,000."
7918.52,7923.52," Yeah, 1809,000 copies, 1808,158 according to NPD."
7923.52,7931.52," To the Wii's roughly, 436,000 units, that's approximately 30,000."
7931.52,7932.52, Where has it been?
7932.52,7933.52, Yeah.
7933.52,7935.52, And he said that we were seeing like a 90% at the time.
7935.52,7937.52, So it seemed like the hardcore Nintendo fans were there.
7937.52,7941.52," It's more of the soccer moms and we sports people who are like, oh, one that crazy."
7941.52,7942.52," Well, well, now I mean, life today."
7942.52,7944.52," I mean, that's still can't find the fucking day."
7944.52,7948.52," Well, that's the thing like we're still the Wii is still supply constrained."
7948.52,7952.52, But what we're seeing is that supply constrained isn't tying directly to the Twilight Princess.
7952.52,7953.52, The Twilight Princess constraintments.
7953.52,7959.52, So we're seeing we expanding into markets that may not be the hardcore gamer or might be the Uber
7959.52,7960.52, or core gamer.
7960.52,7961.52, I disagree.
7961.52,7963.52," Yeah, we talk about the set launch."
7963.52,7965.52," So Garnet, go ahead and illuminate you."
7965.52,7966.52, I think Garnet is for us.
7966.52,7967.52, I just heard a let's let those of you.
7967.52,7968.52, Let's give the numbers.
7968.52,7969.52, The Wii has sold.
7969.52,7971.52, The Wii hasn't stalled at this point.
7971.52,7973.52, Life to date has installed.
7973.52,7974.52, 1.5.
7974.52,7975.52, No.
7975.52,7980.52, The Wii hasn't sold 1.5 million units in North in the United States.
7980.52,7983.52, Zelda Twilight Princess has installed at 1.1.
7983.52,7984.52, It's a 1.1.5 time.
7984.52,7987.52," Oh, well, do you think that it beats my argument?"
7987.52,7988.52," Yeah, it's still selling."
7988.52,7990.52, It's in selling it roughly 73%.
7990.52,7993.52," You're argument, but in the recent numbers, you showed that."
7993.52,7997.52," Didn't you say that several people that the numbers were great for hardware, but not some"
7997.52,8000.52, great for the release numbers show a great spread for hardware.
8000.52,8003.52, But the Zelda Twilight Princess attaches low.
8003.52,8004.52, The problem though.
8004.52,8009.52," My response to that was that, wow, there are a lot of hardcore gamers coming out of their"
8009.52,8012.52, closets and buying we used to play virtual console.
8012.52,8015.52," And see, what was what did I tell you?"
8015.52,8016.52, It launched about that though.
8016.52,8017.52, That those same people would buy Zelda.
8017.52,8021.52," They'll same people would buy Zelda, which is Zelda is still a new game."
8021.52,8024.52," They'll tell him about hardcore of the fuckers, but have they got their calls."
8024.52,8025.52, It's 16 days.
8025.52,8028.52, Zelda is the quintessential hardcore gamer game.
8028.52,8030.52," And now, by the way, time out."
8030.52,8033.52, We've had zeitgeist and quintessential.
8033.52,8036.52," But what you, but what the, the contention they could make."
8036.52,8038.52," And I think it's, it's improbable."
8038.52,8041.52," Is that because Zelda is available on two skews, one being the GameCube skew."
8041.52,8044.52," And it sold roughly, like, according to my numbers,"
8044.52,8049.52," 140, about 144,000 units last month."
8049.52,8053.52," These consumers buying the version, the game on the GameCube and"
8053.52,8055.52, Wings for their Wii purchase to later.
8055.52,8057.52," I think that's an improbable scenario, frankly."
8057.52,8060.52, I don't think that people are buying the Wii for the virtual console lineup.
8060.52,8063.52, As much as we'd like to be able to defend it and say that it is expanding the market.
8063.52,8064.52, Deep-run to the hardcore.
8064.52,8068.52, I believe that the hardcore is going to buy the Wii and buy Zelda.
8068.52,8072.52," I think that that what the Wii is doing right now, at least that we're seeing based on"
8072.52,8077.52," these MPD numbers, and it is unprovable, conjecture what the Wii is doing is"
8077.52,8079.52, probably reaching new markets.
8079.52,8080.52, I just want to intent a one.
8080.52,8081.52, I think it right.
8081.52,8084.52," And I think that the immense success of Wii in January to me,"
8084.52,8088.52," mixed wonder, is there any month this year where Xbox 360 or"
8088.52,8090.52, PlayStation 3 will out sell the Wii?
8090.52,8091.52, I'm starting to think no.
8092.52,8095.52, I think the Wii may out sell those two consoles every single month is
8095.52,8097.52, I'm going to be really disagree.
8097.52,8098.52, I know you disagree.
8098.52,8099.52," Of course, of course."
8099.52,8102.52, I don't think Halo 3 is going to push 360 sales in the month of the
8102.52,8103.52, Reddit series.
8103.52,8105.52, I think that it's beyond that.
8105.52,8109.52, I think that if Halo 3 does not push 360 sales in the month of November in
8109.52,8114.52," December, the problem, yeah, beyond the Wii, because being the PlayStation 3,"
8114.52,8118.52," like Leipzig said for months and months and months, the biggest barrier to"
8118.52,8119.52, the game is the game.
8119.52,8120.52, The game is the game of the game.
8120.52,8123.52, The game of the game is the game of the game of the game of the game of the game of

8172.120000000001,8186.4800000000005, and makes those games of what you more interested in the game of the game of
8186.48,8191.04," 36,000 units a month is as realistic for Nintendo to keep up. I think that right now"
8191.04,8194.88, they're benefiting from the supply constraint. I do think that they're gonna have better numbers than
8194.88,8200.72, Xbox 360 had all last year and those numbers will be better than PS3 pushes this year. But that reason is not
8200.72,8206.88, gonna be because of software although the software wasteland for both PS3 and the Nintendo
8206.88,8211.279999999999, way is gonna be similar through up until the holiday season. We continue to select this. It's
8211.279999999999,8215.359999999999, gonna catch Xbox 360 pretty quickly. I think you guys put Sean to sleep already. It's like
8215.36,8219.6, if you guys could text in your vote is what you would console you things gonna win the hard way.
8219.6,8225.12, I do it right now. It's like American Idol. All I hear is five seconds away from you.
8225.12,8230.640000000001," Me, G, C, D, O, C, B, A, R, L, E, G, D, B, G, D, I want to show you what you got."
8230.640000000001,8234.480000000001," A few other MPD concerns. Okay, PS3 you know it did solve fewer than PS3 than PS3."
8234.480000000001,8238.880000000001, There were no major releases during the January only sounding the headdog which sucked where
8238.880000000001,8241.44, it's PS6 had lost planet which is a great game which was a huge seller.
8241.52,8245.52," And so yeah. Last point, no it was a huge seller."
8245.52,8250.08," It's sold over 400,000 units still less than denorizing debut at slightly. But still"
8250.08,8254.560000000001, Capcom I mean by about but slightly though garnet like your pointy I mean laughing like it's like
8254.560000000001,8259.84," 9,000 units. Dead rising is so much more fun than I was playing. Yeah, get it break. The other thing"
8259.84,8265.28, I have to say is this is the second month in a row where Hanuman Tana for DS outsold every single PSP game.
8265.84,8271.6," Yeah, I mean yeah, I mean like I mean have we talked about Hanuman Tana for"
8271.6,8274.320000000002, rising though. No but have we had we talking about it? It's a setting right?
8274.320000000002,8282.0, So I mean relative life to the PS3 and our PSP and solumers are roughly 66% of DS which is not
8282.0,8286.800000000001, a terrible falloff people should be buying a Sony pointed out in their PR that they are
8286.800000000001,8292.960000000001, rapid they're gaining ground on an intended DS which means they're losing by less every month.
8292.96,8296.72, They only lost by 10% as much and that becomes a point of contention for Sony.
8296.72,8300.24, I think what's going to happen over the years is like I don't know I feel like the old man on the
8300.24,8305.359999999999, block in this like meaning the PC space is it you're going to get to where we've been out for ages and
8305.359999999999,8309.599999999999, PD numbers are like nothing to get excited about unless you want to say like oh my god
8309.599999999999,8312.4, the systems are no it seems are in the top 10 seems are in the top 10 seems are in the top 10
8312.4,8317.599999999999, speed up or uh will the work have will the work have spin in the one of the top five I mean it's like
8317.68,8324.960000000001, there are certain things you expect or the CSI games agate the Christie you know we know that the
8324.960000000001,8329.84, games that sell in the greatest numbers are going to your sister your mother and all these things and
8329.84,8334.4, it's like you get excited when I don't know the game your root for is like in the top 20 or
8334.4,8337.92, some I don't know but the show it's it's a real concern that PSP games do not sell the fact that
8337.92,8342.24, the advice it is to be sorry I did not sell that's a huge I can't tell you when I bought a PSP game
8342.24,8346.960000000001, I mean I think that it's a concern that PSP games don't sell and you know what arguably
8346.96,8350.56, maybe PS3 games don't sell I gotta tell you the most exciting thing I have about my PSP
8350.56,8354.0, I'm sorry I could off your transition I saw you when it transitioned there but the most exciting
8354.0,8360.24, about PSP lately is watching Ryan play PS one games on his act PSP for a more well call the FCC
8360.24,8367.359999999999, one I mean what I was talking about was PSP and PS3 software sales and like Madden which is a pretty popular
8367.359999999999,8372.96, franchise I've heard of that game the month of January sold roughly 69 thousand copies on the PSP
8373.039999999999,8379.199999999999, the PS3 which is new new hardware it sold 75 thousand units it's a disparity of only 6000 units
8379.199999999999,8385.039999999999, for a major franchise one that you would expect to perform a little bit better on new hardware to
8385.039999999999,8391.439999999999, speak also to what's been selling on that new hardware the top 10 currently on the PlayStation 3
8391.439999999999,8397.679999999998, life to date list resistance Madden NFL 2007 called duty need for speed carbon finite around three
8397.68,8404.64, Marvel ultimate alliance NBA of 720 hot project eight Tiger Woods PGA 2 2 or 07 NBA 2k 7
8404.64,8410.800000000001, Rejors 7 full auto 2 battle lines and blazing ageing angels squadrons of World War II and I just
8410.800000000001,8415.76, to give you some some bases for reality the numbers scope that we're looking at there is between 55
8415.76,8422.0, thousand copies and roughly 430 thousand here's the baddest is for Sony out of that out of that
8422.0,8428.24, recitation you just gave how many of those are exclusive we'd like to look at the same list
8428.24,8433.52, two and a half months out on the 360 or the P.R. the PS2 or the dieting I concur with you on that
8433.52,8438.88, however the ace and the whole for Sony was that our hardware is better our games will be better
8438.88,8443.44, we're going to give you a more powerful platform they must have a bit of long-term plan they do have
8443.44,8448.96, long-term plan they do have a long-term plan and they're being aided by the time plan with the success
8449.519999999999,8456.0, of stuff like the PS2 version of guitar hero which sold 2204 thousand units despite what is it 90
8456.0,8462.48, bucks 80 bucks at retail and a huge box on retail shelves which retailers would get second buy and
8462.48,8466.96, people are still buying that skew of the game the PS2 version of madden still among the top 10
8466.96,8473.679999999998, software at 156 thousand copies like we talked about earlier last planet combined skew for her 9000
8473.68,8480.4, regular edition 329 thousand copies i mean there is a lot of there is a lot of stuff to gravitate
8480.4,8484.32, toward in terms of software we hinted at it earlier and wanting to know what i want to touch on one
8484.32,8490.4, of our one of the shows favorite favorite games is bbpaniata and uh one of you and john's favorite
8490.4,8495.28, games dude you played it too don't deny i played it you're a correct way so this is number you're
8495.28,8500.0, gonna say it's bad but it's not as bad as it's bad but it's it's not as bad as it could have been
8500.0,8505.68, in it shows signs of potential legs if there's a significant price drop in a re-upping of the marketing
8505.68,8512.4, program it's sold 166 thousand units life today it it limptan roughly at 35 thousand units which is
8512.4,8520.24, again just for context about half as many copies as moved on madden on 360 and that came that we
8520.24,8524.72, talked about earlier hand-in-month hand-in-the-ds so the fuck is hand-in-month hand-in-the-hand it's a hot
8524.72,8530.4, dizzy general property interestingly enough like an antenna that she she's actually billi-reciors
8530.4,8535.039999999999, is daughter and he's a he's a proccontucky like myself two skews a m i two scissor in a
8535.039999999999,8542.08, entend-dog sold 137 thousand units go to oba's or last last month i mean we're not going to grant that
8542.08,8551.679999999998, daughter of san andreus on ps2 ps2 68 thousand units just for a frame of reference xbox xbox owners
8551.76,8557.84, gobbled up halo to in january to the tune of roughly 70 thousand units and how many
8557.84,8561.52, we've been paying the honest and they buy that same time you're paying out of during the same time
8561.52,8567.36, generated roughly half of that 35 thousand units well it's uh we life today numbers if you're really
8567.36,8573.44, into that uh number two i mean number one we all know is the legend of the way we we talk about this
8573.44,8580.0, lunch also speaking of things we talked about a lunch MPD interesting section of the world right
8580.0,8585.2, because well it's important that people take n pd numbers with a a veritable grant of salt because
8585.2,8589.76, it's the equivalent of like cable rating system like it's this is not the authority of the
8589.76,8595.68, proccontation it is an approximation that that does not based on retellers it's based on retellers report
8595.68,8600.32, figures but it doesn't include all retailers popular retailers like walmart are left out on the
8600.32,8604.8, cold i've heard of them before yeah have you heard of walmart i think kind of a big deal so it's
8604.88,8609.439999999999, why are we get so excited about mpd's and because all we have do because take it away from the
8609.439999999999,8613.84, free app is just for north america to you it's all you ask for you ask not even all can
8613.84,8618.0, it's a bit comes up for us whenever they bring up like pc and pd i don't even really care because
8618.0,8625.119999999999, it's like i mean the world market for pc is it's just so like first you can capture
8625.119999999999,8629.679999999998, you can capture small shots of other markets i mean media create japan you can you will
8630.0,8634.16, but that's for yeah but but it's it's easy to gauge japan in north america but on pc now it's like
8634.16,8639.84, uh i mean european union outside of it like former you know Soviet countries where surprisingly
8639.84,8644.960000000001, we hear from people that do sell in those regions that like uh uh there's there's actually a good
8644.960000000001,8650.0, deal of legitimate sales even though the piracy is where it didn't stuff anyway to move on to the
8650.0,8655.44, we life to date software numbers number one i think we all expected legends i'll tell that
8655.44,8661.12, princess sort of the killer app for the Zelda playing machine at one point one two million copies
8661.84,8668.4, thank god that raiman raving rabbits has exceeded it's the i was surprised by five five thousand
8668.4,8675.04, units i two six five to two sixty essentially and uh super monkey ball banana blitz and madden
8675.04,8679.84, are waiting in the wings along with worry wear smooth moves which debuted in January with 200
8679.84,8684.4, 1000 units it's another one of those Nintendo IPs a surprising comparison call of duty three has
8684.48,8686.8, sold more copies than we than on ps3 that surprised me
8688.0,8692.4, get you played it well the thing of well the number to be and i don't have it and i can't do
8692.4,8697.68, the math up in front of me would be to tie the call of duty three on we present in stop percentage
8697.68,8703.199999999999, to the call of duty three in stop percentage on ps3 that would be call of duty three was so good
8703.199999999999,8709.039999999999, as the pc version was awesome wasn't it that good i think it's too due to have to split the sales
8709.039999999999,8713.92, for three sixty and ps3 call duty together because it's like if i was going to play that game
8714.0,8717.6, i would play either order to matter you know whatever but like it's a whole other category
8717.6,8722.08, of the soft all you're welcome to totally disdeme for notes well that no whatever like i'm
8722.08,8725.44, i don't even really care because i played it and it's like the multiplayer is what united
8725.44,8731.68, offensive was uh which was great and i was actually madden uh infinity were dropped all the stuff
8731.68,8736.32, that uh that gray matter brought in for right i did offensive right so they brought that to the
8736.32,8742.24, concepts that was cool but the single player was like it just hit the point where okay i could
8742.32,8747.199999999999, deal with it and it was cool and two and and two you know and and it is just being like the
8747.199999999999,8752.16, the other total linear the whole thing and they you know they spread out and and fan out a bit
8752.16,8756.24, in the later levels and two but it was just too much by the time three came out have you seen the
8756.24,8762.64, Vietnam or modern era game from infinity war um if it if the stuff which one is it by the scene
8762.64,8767.039999999999, which one is it which one is it which one is youtube videos which one is real what's infinity
8767.12,8772.080000000002, we're doing is it is it is it not not not Vietnam as far as i know as a simple contemporary
8772.080000000002,8777.84, what one thing to to sort of continue to go back to the sales right right uh the actual
8777.84,8783.6, install numbers of games that have sold over a hundred thousand units on ps3 is one two three four
8783.6,8789.92, five six titles on the Nintendo Wii which has been you know i've made the joke of calling it a Zelda
8790.0,8797.28, playing machine that number is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
8797.28,8802.64, titles on the Nintendo Wii install base more the twice of life saved right but i'm still
8802.64,8807.84, but third party software making argument third party software Nintendo Wii is actually sort of six
8807.84,8814.64, is succeeding more that has previously if you seen graphs i mean the the the graphing is is indicative
8814.64,8819.28, of more success for the third party but at the same time the Wii still continues to suffer from
8819.28,8825.44, a series of ports to talk about what's it's talking about something beyond and pd sales figures
8825.44,8831.52, i think it's a circuit city is jumping in to take an Xbox marketing xbox 360 marketing phrase
8831.52,8836.16, but jumping into the use game biz garnet you you came over to my desk this week to talk
8836.16,8842.08, to me about this a little bit and you have no idea how big a touchy subject this is especially
8842.08,8845.28, publishers because here's the publishers here's the publishers if you want to publish a viewpoint
8845.28,8850.16, is that if you're buying used games they're getting fucked that's really how they see it they're
8850.16,8855.36, they're very single right this no they're not getting fucked because i can tell you look i was a
8855.36,8860.24, district manager for e-be games for long time i've seen all kinds of internal numbers with sales
8860.24,8866.400000000001, figures and all that kind of stuff when the game business gets bigger as a whole everyone benefits
8866.400000000001,8872.24, but the publishers don't see that they're very entrenched in their viewpoint of of per title earnings
8872.32,8877.039999999999, they look at everything in terms of this is a title it's a triple a title it succeeds
8877.039999999999,8881.6, when a title doesn't do well it's very easy for them because it allows them to establish blame to
8881.6,8885.119999999999, say that title didn't do well it doesn't mean anything but the game business doesn't mean anything
8885.119999999999,8889.28, about anything else doesn't the fact that that title didn't do well publishers and platform
8889.28,8894.16, holders despised use games they totally hated pan for last 20 years there's been a concert effort
8894.16,8898.56, to destroy the use game business make it illegal and digital distribution the advent of that
8898.56,8902.16, would bring about the destruction of the use game market it might but here's the thing about the
8902.16,8908.4, use game market the the use game market is only open for disruption for destruction because e-be games
8908.4,8912.96, or game stop or whatever the fuck they are now has screwed it up so badly with their whole
8912.96,8918.08, we're gonna so will use game for five dollars less than new what the fuck is wrong yeah how do you
8918.08,8923.68, ever think that i'm gonna sell you a used game dude i'm five all right there too and like i do
8923.68,8930.32, this door cool shit anyway anybody out through buys games knows the deal but i want to go back to
8930.32,8935.04, in the conversation that that just took place is that remember earlier this summer when you're
8935.04,8941.04, talking on the show about Sony's effort to create like a DRM system that would essentially issue
8942.32,8947.04, the use game market and a sign a number basically it'd be like you buy a game that games
8947.12,8952.480000000001, assigned to your machine well wouldn't essentially uh moving forward with the digital distribution
8952.480000000001,8957.2, model accomplish the same goal yeah i mean this again sort of comes back to what chain and i
8957.2,8963.12, talked about last week that that warlock is nor the first or warlock is the first but it is certainly
8963.12,8970.800000000001, not the last game you're gonna see from a CEA that is a digital distribution game only here's
8970.800000000001,8974.320000000002, the challenge for content providers the challenge for content providers is to pull their heads out of
8974.32,8980.48, the sand and be willing to take that risk to be the guy who stands out there and offers your game
8980.48,8985.44, up and let's the whole world build around it let's use people buy it let's new people buy it
8985.44,8990.64, whenever because the more people that are playing games ultimately the more energized and the more
8990.64,8994.4, a lie you know what kind of fucking hippie come you're living in but you do not understand business
8995.199999999999,8999.84, you know what i disagree i do understand business my bank account disagrees with you
9000.48,9005.28, okay our whole thing is like the dude the dealer he like gives out the free little like package
9005.28,9009.92, exactly the fool's on the street like come back remember but not but not in a malicious way in a

9036.48,9040.48, other games or something he tells didn't exist in the environment anymore they probably don't
9040.48,9046.16, they they probably don't have a necessary place in in what we have as games because games are
9046.16,9051.44, not movies they're not books we don't need a goddamn brick and mortar they smell like rotten McDonald's
9052.32,9056.800000000001, oh that's it on moving on it looks just like what the hell to happen out of that

9091.76,9096.720000000001, the name rationing clank future tools of destruction works on many levels it signals a new air
9096.720000000001,9102.560000000001, for the franchise ties into the game stories includes one of our signature subtitled double on tundra's

9134.72,9140.32, most of you haven't did if you will say wow they look better than better than expected and when you see
9140.32,9144.24, the video from the first it's not as good as that move file hey remember that video footage that
9144.24,9150.96, leaked from my gdc last year that ran about a 15 15 frames per second we're gonna have it at 30 plus
9150.96,9156.88, and we're gonna have some gameplay treats over at game videos when it's time get ready it's everything
9157.519999999999,9162.4, it's everything wow from the next year and matching clank wall off to become multiplayer only
9163.279999999999,9169.359999999999, for is it yeah exactly this has been it this has been this has been a messy source of
9169.359999999999,9176.08, contention all day at the office here's a story since PlayStation 3 was originally unveiled at
9176.08,9180.48, e3 2005 we've been led to believe that Sony has been leading the crusade to resurrect Warhawk on
9180.48,9186.72, the platform same Kennedy the ESC from one up dot com posted this in his blog what i do know
9186.72,9192.24, it's some interesting choice cut some interesting choices have it indeed been made in terms of its
9192.24,9197.359999999999, scope and I'm curious to see how they're over with people myself included what Warhawk has apparently
9197.359999999999,9202.8, evolved or devolved that's my own edit depending on where you're coming from into is a multiplayer
9202.8,9207.279999999999, only title featuring ground in the air combat that'll be downloadable from the PlayStation network
9207.36,9211.44, it's interesting because I know a lot of people's perception of the game will change once they
9211.44,9216.400000000001, here it's downloadable over psn as opposed to being a full retail game it shouldn't I believe this
9216.400000000001,9220.400000000001, could actually become a great demonstration of what Sony has in store for us for downloadable games
9220.400000000001,9226.880000000001, before anyone else jumps in i do think that what's saying is true and i also think that what Sony
9226.880000000001,9231.12, is going to do with PlayStation network is going to be embodied in what they're doing in Warhawk
9231.44,9238.0, you can't handle the truth shame what you got uh i think it's a good idea well the thing is like
9238.0,9243.36, if you're making full feature like full games available over the psn you're moving in a direction
9243.36,9249.12, it's completely different than the ll will just port this game to vc or ll we're going to offer
9249.12,9253.92, you achievements with this old version of pack man so he's going to carve their own nation on
9253.92,9259.12, life and give you yet another reason to purchase the ps3 just give you a little different
9259.12,9264.24, perspective shawng how long of digital downloads of games been available for pc what i mean
9264.24,9269.44, everyone celebrated uh the whole uh Xbox live stuff i mean just getting outside of this monolithic
9269.44,9274.08, package for a game that you have the 59 ninety on version of game and then people now are ready to buy
9274.08,9279.2, that whatever 599 you know 89 whatever but what about the development between there that seems cool
9279.2,9283.28, seems fine for me and if and if the rest of the game wasn't working rather than like shit can
9283.28,9287.6, the whole thing pull out what does work that's kind of the best use of that and what we've heard
9287.6,9292.240000000002, is this project was a little troubled and it decided to like you know make it smaller yeah i don't know
9292.240000000002,9297.76, it seems cool the more options we have and the more like variety of game you know sizes and
9297.76,9303.44, categories we can we can choose from seems uh seems like we all benefit from that and again too i mean
9303.44,9307.44, does that create like this mid category game or instead of you know your multi-million dollar
9307.52,9312.16, development thing or instead of your you know shoe string budget and two programmers on Xbox live you
9312.16,9316.24, have something in between i mean i know that's not the case for this they pumped a whole lot of money
9316.24,9321.6, and in this specific situations probably a matter of losing a lot of that but uh going ahead maybe
9321.6,9326.24," someone's like hey we'll give you $200,000 to make a game do what you can with it and you've got"
9326.24,9334.16, a more of a paradise lost sort of situation i think in other news in a scholastic twist mercenaries
9334.16,9339.76, two has completed the assassins create training core it went beyond that dude what we've what we've
9339.76,9345.039999999999, said for ages just like we said with the assassins create has proven true how this make your news segment
9345.039999999999,9349.119999999999, that's all i want to add what i think it made it just to say like hey yes well you're okay we
9349.119999999999,9354.32, knew it was coming to ps3 and physics we didn't know it was coming to ps3 and ps2 well ps2 is a different
9354.32,9360.0, it's a completely different demonetist smart decision well that's the thing in the if it's coming to ps2
9360.32,9366.48, who says not coming to the way what what you mean it obviously it is right only because the psp first
9366.48,9373.76, right home former oblivion designer Ken Ralston has jumped ship he was a lead on elder scrolls three
9373.76,9378.88, more wind and elder scrolls for oblivion the latter which so pretty well i've heard that pretty okay
9378.88,9383.04, one of the war it did decent on the xbox 360 we're still waiting to see how it doesn't appear
9383.04,9388.8, three we're getting to build this back a year and a half later hey he's jumped ship to go to big
9388.8,9394.96, huge games uh Brian Reynolds team train the president of big huge games offered this
9395.84,9400.72, Ken's addition marks a bold new direction for big huge games we remain committed to creating a
9400.72,9405.759999999998, real-time strategy games such as our past hits rise of nations and rise of legends at the same time
9405.759999999998,9411.119999999999, we've explored developing a role playing game for several years now Ken is a fantastic fit for us
9411.119999999999,9416.88, on every level and gives us the leadership we need to be confident of our uh confident of our
9416.96,9422.16, success in our new venture also is as Brian Reynolds is one of those lightning rods around which
9422.16,9428.24, cool things happens rise of legends was was my it was at the top of my list of most overlooked
9428.24,9433.759999999998, games for last year well they continue with the bethaz the love i guess Bethesda says hey guess what
9433.759999999998,9439.439999999999, elder scrolls five yeah we'll do a shocker what ever interested in printing money with our existing
9439.439999999999,9445.599999999999, IP the next elder scrolls scrolls game is a long way off says patchy a classic but Bethesda did say
9445.6,9452.4, that yeah we'll look at doing another one will there be a madden game this year exactly what i can tell you
9453.44,9458.24, that since oblivious months of just smashing success that i'm sure we'll do it many other scrolls five
9458.24,9464.48, but there are no immediate plans now said peat hides he's he's pretty cagey and sometimes the
9464.48,9469.2, things that that mr. Heinz will say on the record are completely different than what he'll tell you
9469.2,9472.800000000001, I'm off the record I'm not gonna be drawn into that cover so yeah garnet let's all drop
9473.759999999998,9479.119999999999, hey you've shane i have a question for you what do you know what do the DS fat the game boy advance SP and the
9479.119999999999,9484.0, PSP having common they're all portable consoles they're all part of the past if I believe this
9484.0,9490.08, eb ad but says play the future and look at this ad right here shane you can trade all those in for
9490.08,9495.759999999998, I can trade you might copy a ridgeracer for PSP and get ridgeracer for DS you can trade in your your DS fat for
9495.759999999998,9501.519999999999, 60 bucks your PSP for a hunt box or your game boy yeah that's a little important for taste perhaps
9501.84,9506.880000000001, a little p-thing a little bit i mean the thing is like the DS is only in North America out selling
9507.6,9512.880000000001, PS3 like three to two you mean PSP yeah he's just wondering if they'll bury and in the coal with a PSP
9512.880000000001,9516.16, the DS raping with PS3 it's a ray that's true
9517.76,9524.720000000001, one no more about super paper Mario I do no don't we all shane's answering your burning questions
9524.720000000001,9530.16, or not on his blog well shane was answering his burning questions on your blog Nintendo said
9530.48,9535.84, almost nothing about super paper Mario since announcing that the game had no longer been planned for
9535.84,9540.96, the game cube and instead would be ditched in favor of shipping April 9th for the Nintendo we
9541.76,9547.36, shane took it unto himself to answer some user questions about the game prior to his season to
9547.36,9552.32, cyst let's turn back the clock and see just what users wanted to know about super paper Mario
9553.2,9559.28, noise noisy asked how did the 2d 3d mechanics work can the player switch between the two at any time
9559.36,9563.28, shane offers you actually control several different characters during the game but only
9563.28,9568.720000000001, Mario can flip the world between 2d and 3d it's easy I do it's press the A button to flip the 3d
9568.720000000001,9574.0, but while in that view a meter constantly counts down if it runs out you begin to lose HP
9574.0,9580.08, it refills slowly was used to which back to 2d same dude asks are underfooter
9580.08,9585.04, muses is the next big thing for we owners after a seller would you say or is it just a mild
9585.04,9590.080000000002, distraction until super Mario galaxy compared to most of the weest of out there shane says this
9590.080000000002,9595.28, is a really made game it's also more accessible than past pm games given this traditional
9595.28,9601.44, Mario gameplay that pm means paper Mario games so while shane loved before he was issued a
9601.44,9606.320000000002, season to cyst from Nintendo super paper Mario and he was you're doing it service I felt like
9606.320000000002,9610.240000000002, I mean to explain this a little bit there was an embargo and I read it pretty carefully and there was
9610.72,9615.199999999999, a miscommunication about what we could say when we couldn't say and because there's nothing
9615.199999999999,9619.039999999999, known about this game literally and it comes out literally nothing and it comes out in five weeks
9619.039999999999,9623.28, I mean we knew more about like GTA by city than we do about this game seriously but apparently
9623.28,9627.36, Nintendo they have some other plans for when they're gonna reveal what this game is and how you play it
9627.36,9631.92, despite the fact that we have it so it's stay tuned and maybe you'll figure out what this game is
9631.92,9637.92, all about coming up on game life the season to cyst seems indicative to me of an information
9637.92,9643.92, basic exclusive that may go to a competitor site like say maybe ij and landed the the paper
9643.92,9649.12, Mark exclusive I mean that's what happens when your ij and cube or we editors dating someone
9649.12,9654.8, Nintendo is that for real burn hot blood it's really on that for a minute you can't bring up that kind of
9654.8,9659.2, shit with me around it I don't expect it to live read on I'm not gonna make a joke about it unless it's true
9660.0,9665.84, guess that's some rotten shit right there hot burn hot blooded rhythm so you know what that is
9665.92,9671.04, that's the sound of me ejaculating because there is an awareness thing but just like I said I'm
9671.04,9676.24, okay just like I said a wind and sequel coming to Japan but you know wind on sequel isn't a leapy
9676.24,9681.44, day in sequel is everything is I don't care baby I'm tapping on taps tapping away to the rhythm
9681.44,9687.36, and the sounds of whatever kachi yano wants me to do and I'm there sign me up uh start dancing
9687.36,9691.36, you know leapy the series you say I mean you have no idea you're depth of this you're gay for
9691.44,9698.400000000001, these me I can't wait to get into our here on 360 because I finally build a play in the
9698.400000000001,9701.6, environment that's been most conducive to me where my friends can watch me play
9702.400000000001,9707.68, then tendos cussers that even me do well I'm I have been played until now because I want my friends
9707.68,9712.720000000001, to be able to see that I'm rocking then tendos sporting this little bit
9713.76,9717.92, all two and you say Nintendo loves their customers then they're like crimenating shit why do you want it like
9718.0,9723.12, advertise that Nintendo loves their customers they know they're saying informing them so much
9724.0,9728.960000000001, it's evidence by the super big Mario season to assist I eat that we stepped on the IGN Mac
9728.960000000001,9734.64, cast mask in the married someone from Nintendo exclusive there's been one around you for days
9734.64,9740.8, out but a woman in redman Washington broke her we after a marathon session of gaming with her
9740.8,9745.04, six year old son the Wii was about a month old at this point and the kid was pretty upset
9745.04,9749.68, without as we sports well redman Washington as we all know is where an o a's based essentially
9749.68,9756.0, what happened is the women took her we eat to Nintendo of America and in a half hour they repaired it
9756.0,9760.960000000001, header out the door oh that's a beautiful story it's a great story right it's charming
9760.960000000001,9766.720000000001, especially in light of all the stories of we've called the Xbox 360 support in India and it is
9766.720000000001,9771.68, taking us hours to get this against the console to fix the we apologize to the entire audience I'm
9771.68,9777.76, gotten it I was for all the people who have had bad Microsoft responses with the with the
9777.76,9784.16, Colin line winner my stepdad had a red ring it is I mean she's a product of the firmware update
9784.16,9788.800000000001, he mentioned my name or anything and he got a ticket if you send us your console we will
9788.800000000001,9795.12, maybe refund your year 360 with a refurbished edition of the console for all right keep going
9795.6,9800.08, no lightsaber game for the we just yet this is just makes sense to you
9800.08,9804.560000000001, can you join a general line give it to control you a general lightsaber seems about the most
9804.560000000001,9810.560000000001, natural concept for the we mom yeah seems yeah Lucas Arth hasn't said a thing about it yet what's
9810.560000000001,9815.92, the deal well the deal is that Lucas Arth can only announce according to a minute that they set
9815.92,9821.36, down last year two new Star Wars related IPs per year and guess what I know one of them is
9821.36,9826.08, second announced this year and I'm not telling you yet but the but the other one probably won't be
9826.08,9830.560000000001, a week and what do you think the Dark Forces engines would run away right real quick I want to say
9830.560000000001,9834.640000000001, like talking about Dream Games Dream Games on Wii Dream Games but you got what you got I want
9834.640000000001,9839.28, I want a mini golf game where I can like edit courses it's like you know that the golf on
9839.28,9844.16, Wii Sports not so hot not so good it's cool the putting works fine so like if I could like edit
9844.16,9848.960000000001, of course trade that with the friends online that I got to get that like retarded but I'm about Mario Golf
9848.96,9853.519999999999, for Wii have that option but but yeah but like yeah full I'm talking like full of good
9853.519999999999,9858.0, our group goldburg holes and stuff you know yeah set up your fucking windmill that shoots into a castle
9858.0,9864.0, that would be yeah I like that idea I like it to boy Shane to boy Koji Kondo he's good guy he's
9864.0,9871.119999999999, gonna be a video games live at GDC uh it's gonna be do do do do do do do he wrote that Friday
9871.119999999999,9876.96, March and I hear wrote all the music for Zelda in Mario he's a kind of a big deal kind of a big deal
9876.96,9883.039999999999, true he's gonna be a GDC and Friday March 9th at the knob hill Masonic auditorium they're
9883.039999999999,9887.439999999999, gonna be playing but like my question is who's really gonna be there 300 opens that night
9889.519999999999,9892.88, you're already told me you're going Saturday at one point I'm going Saturday and fully I'm actually
9893.679999999998,9899.519999999999, yeah absolutely I think it's gonna be healer it's doing uh want matchmaking gears for
9900.08,9903.679999999998, I certainly do I think that everyone here is talked about how they want matchmaking gears for
9904.32,9909.04, go work for epic games and then interview with one up a few weeks ago
9909.04,9913.68, Phil Spencer talked about how the matchmaking function from Halo 2 is something that they wanted
9913.68,9919.36, implement across the board next box 360 games but specifically in Microsoft Game Studios published
9919.36,9927.12, titles epic games vice president Mark Rain responded on the gears of war official forms with this
9927.12,9932.48, it isn't realistic to suggest that we can integrate thousands of lines of three-year-old Halo
9932.48,9938.32, two source code and the gears of war and have working Halo 2 style lobby functionality in any
9938.32,9944.24, reasonable period of time it would be far more efficient for us to develop it ourselves but unfortunately
9944.24,9950.16, this is a multiple man year effort and as I indicated above we're sure on people it would take
9951.279999999999,9956.4, do something like this in a time frame that makes it worthwhile those comments from Mr. Rain echo
9956.4,9963.039999999999, what Phil Spencer said when he told one up that it was either co-op in gears of war or matchmaking
9963.039999999999,9967.76, you want to be more amazed I'm sitting there eating eaten barbecue with Mark the other day and he's all
9967.76,9973.76, like dude we're hiring one guy a month I'm like wait I thought you said you were trying to hire
9973.76,9977.76, people he's like no we are trying to hire people so that's the reason do you hear this right now
9977.76,9983.6, it's because they want to give you a Ferrari because the guys who finished gears are taking home some
9983.6,9989.12, serious fucking bank the residuals right now from a game like years are pretty high coupled with
9989.12,9993.68, fact that couple of the fact that that's a that's a I mean that's an IP that's going to be looking
9993.68,10000.640000000001, at a pretty significant size sequel come November of 2008 no Xbox live arcade released this week
10001.2,10005.2, makers have actually sort of makes jokes about it on the gamers car blog this I mean no
10005.2,10009.6, there are a few titles that were all really looking forward to but game development remains as much
10009.6,10013.44, an art as a science that everyone's working hard to bring out the titles that we've been
10013.44,10018.16, announced as soon as we can it may or may not be about to run up yours by the one up dot
10018.16,10023.28, combat the time you were in the he'll do come any titles came to the PSN and Bertrick console this week
10023.28,10027.84, shame shame how many you're still in crapping by the way he's about to tell you what's coming next week
10027.84,10034.48, for four vc games right as pretty usual and probably this week flow and cube it and an
10034.48,10039.52, demo two games what's coming next week and Xbox live our game we can reveal exclusive
10039.52,10044.640000000001, that's going to be alien how which people will wait for people who wait for that one finally
10044.640000000001,10049.92, and what do we get worse in a couple in a conversation between Aaron Greenberg from Microsoft
10049.92,10056.560000000001, the night that I had on Thursday afternoon he said that while you may feel like because I said that
10056.560000000001,10060.48, if you looked at the Xbox live release schedule for the last six weeks if you're my girlfriend
10060.48,10066.4, I'm breaking up with you so he promised me that March would be like makeup sex so in March
10066.48,10072.0, I would expect games like Castlevania Katan and probably a couple other heavy hitters also at GDC
10072.0,10076.24, expect playable versions of first party Xbox live arcade games however
10077.279999999999,10081.52, and Greenberg did confirm to one up that the geometry war sequel which he did not deny
10081.52,10086.64, its existence of which we've talked about on this program before would not appear at GDC
10086.64,10090.88, expect I would say at GDC expect to see the the marathon game and I'm not gonna tell you who's
10090.96,10097.599999999999, working on it but it's not Bungie. Forza Motorsport 2 to have options and tournaments turning that
10097.599999999999,10102.8, whole car culture thing into like car eBay which is what when you're not the real driving simulator
10102.8,10107.759999999998, which forza isn't you need to find another way to cut to cultivate car culture.
10108.96,10114.72, The auction house itself is self explanatory players buy and sell on game customize vehicles
10114.72,10119.199999999999, from other players it's a mini eBay for virtual mechanics and here's what to expect
10119.2,10124.400000000001, great online auctions and sell your customized rides gives car tuning experts in a depth
10124.400000000001,10128.800000000001, delivery painters purposes they can now build up in game. Hey let me ask you a question
10128.800000000001,10132.880000000001, are they gonna actually make that bullshit they showed off with like cell phones and on that crap work
10133.84,10138.720000000001, that's something for the live anywhere group not to look Smith group. We in commander and
10138.720000000001,10143.36, let's just say probably not. We in commander and line with an angry member told me about the rising
10143.36,10150.480000000001, support of third party developers for xpysliverk and he did say that while Microsoft's first
10150.480000000001,10155.68, party and a move that is somewhat antithetical to the way that Sony's PlayStation network is approaching
10155.68,10160.800000000001, the online space with Sony having several of their notable first party developers working on
10160.800000000001,10166.880000000001, premium grade PlayStation network games like the eco team we've seen examples of that with like
10166.880000000001,10171.28, the tech and five port we're gonna continue to see examples like that going forward throughout the year
10172.24,10178.08, so Microsoft's first party will not be leading the charge but will be somewhat carrying the torch
10178.08,10183.36, for first part development online online space but it seems to be an area that Microsoft's
10183.36,10191.12, willing to give away to ps3 so if maybe you may see an insomniac xpysliverk or PlayStation network
10191.12,10196.560000000001, game long before you see a bungee xpysliverk title it's a difference in approaches and one that may
10196.56,10203.76, ultimately prove costly for xpysliverk users that's like I aren't it. Wow spin some serious knowledge
10203.76,10208.96, there the close isn't he? I think we've left plenty out there for discussion Sean thanks for being on the show man.
10208.96,10214.48, Yeah dude it's not a pleasure look I think you like had the right of it would you write on that sheet of paper
10215.439999999999,10220.56, I said Sean is what Sean after the second segment is welcome to come on the show anytime he sort of
10220.56,10226.16, assert himself as a valuable member of the team. I personally would like to see down in the group
10226.16,10230.16, anytime that we have a spot on cool be fun if you ever get out mark grain around
10230.72,10235.2, we might be a good time actually quick I had to say it up in this event it's been eaten yet for months now
10235.2,10241.039999999999, but ever since I did the egm podcast talk about gears war my thought it was an excellent game but it just wasn't
10241.039999999999,10248.0, the 10 for me um mark called one of my co-workers to complain and yell and steam and storm about it
10248.0,10253.92, and the whole time I'm like eight can you call me can you? I was on the bucket I'd love to explain everything
10254.0,10258.64, back at all your points dude mark and I and it wasn't like I was saying this is a great game
10258.64,10264.64, it's just not like the pit of me of like of greatness you know and uh and it was like hey you know
10264.64,10269.28, I even emailed him I was like mark I know you're busy dude and it doesn't it's a waste of your time to talk to me
10269.28,10273.84, but if it it's also a waste of your time to get mad and yell at my co-workers about stuff I said in the co-workers
10273.84,10278.64, didn't even listen they weren't on the podcast you know like if you want to talk I'd love to talk so that might be a good
10278.64,10284.0, time to make that mark and I had a similar going around with a similar one of your co-workers and uh
10284.0,10289.359999999999, Mr. Rain and I sort of things out so I think that you had the same thing happen he yeah after after I called him
10289.359999999999,10295.439999999999, and in Mr. Bullseon's key Dicks on our show uh he contacted a co-worker of yours and then uh
