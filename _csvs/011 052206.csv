0.0,7.0, Hello again this is Jeff Green the editor and chief of CGW.
7.0,11.0, I'm going to keep trying to come up with a different way of not doing that.
11.0,12.0, Hello.
12.0,14.0, But every time it comes up the same.
14.0,19.0, Anyway we're here for our first post E3 podcast.

26.0,28.0, Darreglesto Scott has no the engineer.
28.0,32.0, You know what I think we need is we need to theme song to this podcast totally.
32.0,36.0, Don't you think then I don't have to go hello and welcome every time.
36.0,39.0, Well actually you know you still will because you know the shoot.
39.0,43.0, Music will fade out and then you're going to be like nothing.
43.0,44.0, You're right.
44.0,45.0, Well how will we throw it out to the audience?
45.0,47.0, We can have them do a remake of you saying hello.
47.0,49.0," First of all,"
49.0,52.0, you should have a kind of like whoever like our listeners all three of them.
52.0,55.0, Then we'll like just pop up with the best like.
55.0,56.0, You got another one?
56.0,57.0, Exactly.
57.0,58.0, My mom's listening now.
58.0,59.0, Oh cool.
59.0,61.0, Hey we're up to the thousands now.
61.0,62.0, Swanard.
62.0,63.0, It's readers.
63.0,64.0, For listeners.
64.0,65.0, Aren't we?
65.0,66.0, Yeah we are.
66.0,67.0, Okay.
67.0,71.0, Yeah I got I think tonight at home I'm going to practice in the mirror some new like.
71.0,72.0, Hi.
72.0,73.0, No.
73.0,74.0, Different.
74.0,77.0, Or you know what what I tell other people is you know right out your open.
77.0,80.0, Yeah right out your clothes and actually like read it.
80.0,81.0, But you have to say hello.
81.0,82.0, I can't just start out.
82.0,84.0, We can write hello and then read it.
84.0,86.0, Alright John is saying move on.
86.0,90.0, We're going to talk about the podcast.
90.0,92.0, Alright we're going to start off.
92.0,100.0, We had the whole E3 thing gotten away of all of our gaming so now we're back was a normal week and I assume for many of us that meant playing games.
100.0,102.0, So what have we been playing?
102.0,103.0, Anyone?
103.0,105.0, Well I know what Ryan's been playing though.
105.0,107.0, Let him talk about it anyway.
107.0,108.0, Go ahead.
108.0,109.0, Get it over with.
109.0,110.0, Guild Wars factions.
110.0,112.0, You're wearing the T-shirt even though.
113.0,115.0, Oh God.
115.0,119.0, He has well aren't you the people playing the game he's wearing the shirt.
119.0,121.0, He killed the horses awesome.
121.0,122.0, I'm not doubting that.
122.0,124.0, This is a podcast paid for by NC so.
124.0,128.0, No it's still I'm about halfway through the factions campaign.
128.0,130.0, It's still really good.
130.0,136.0, I'm getting to the point where the two player factions can compete over control of an area.
136.0,140.0, So that's the next thing I got to get into NCL that works.
140.0,143.0, Can I see something about the scheme?
143.0,145.0, Because I started playing it and I was liking it.
145.0,153.0," But I noticed now that at the town exits like to go into the instances, there's all these like NPC dudes standing around that you can hire."
153.0,154.0, Right?
154.0,158.0, So does that mean I basically don't ever have to play it with other humans if I don't want to?
158.0,161.0, There are places in the game that you cannot get through in NPCs.
161.0,162.0, Damn it.
162.0,165.0, I mean there's I see humans.
165.0,167.0, Some of the some of the like the story missions.
167.0,168.0, Yeah.
168.0,173.0, Once you reach the mainland or just I mean maybe you could get through with NPCs if you're really good.
173.0,174.0, I am.
174.0,179.0, Well yeah I think you need the because I'm still playing the old one.
179.0,184.0, You yeah exactly you need this like okay do this do this because I don't really the NPCs just run in and just.
184.0,186.0, Sure you have no control over what those guys.
186.0,187.0, Right.
187.0,188.0, So yeah.
188.0,192.0, Okay so they're just to kind of help you out at the beginning part.
192.0,200.0, I mean anything that isn't like one of the big like heavy story missions you can generally kind of get through it in PCs.
200.0,201.0, Yeah.
201.0,204.0, But yeah you're going to you're going to need to make friends at some point.
204.0,205.0, Yeah.
205.0,207.0, Also can we officially stop calling this an MMO.
207.0,208.0, It's not.
208.0,210.0, How is this an MMO?
210.0,212.0, It's just Diablo basically.
212.0,213.0, Right.
213.0,214.0, But you walk through the chat room.
214.0,219.0, That's the different of MMOs that aren't in and see soft promotional hour.
219.0,221.0, It's been playing auto assault.
221.0,222.0, Yeah.
222.0,224.0, So first they want to be an MMO.
224.0,226.0, It's an MMO in structure and everything.
226.0,228.0, It's just not in player base.
228.0,234.0, So I think during peak hours they're hitting on the server and I'm on the most populated server which is called breakdown.
234.0,239.0, And I think it was like 240 players or something in 240 players.
239.0,240.0, Right.
240.0,241.0, And that was the three zeros at the end there.
241.0,242.0, No.
242.0,245.0, So you know we're going through this this world this ghost town.
245.0,246.0, We're shouting.
246.0,247.0, It's like a big pocket lineman.
247.0,248.0, We're not at all.
248.0,250.0, And we get like five different people.
250.0,252.0, Sometimes we'll be playing for hours and we'll run into a person.
252.0,253.0, It's crazy.
253.0,254.0, So we expect to find you here.
254.0,257.0, It's like all of a sudden you're playing Mario Brothers and someone pops up.
257.0,258.0, Does that add to like it?
258.0,261.0, Does that add to sort of like the post-capacaleptic feel?
261.0,263.0, You know that there's no one there.
263.0,264.0, It definitely does.
264.0,265.0," So I'm like, I can't see."
265.0,266.0, Like they do.
266.0,270.0, They decided to act and talk like they're living in a doomed world.
270.0,275.0," I mean, they're already talking about acting for pro rates for type of the rossum when that comes out."
275.0,279.0," But with the bottom line is, I kind of predicted that."
279.0,284.0, But now I feel I've kind of honed out that I did do that because I liked the game.
284.0,285.0, It's a fun MM.
285.0,287.0," Well, it's not your fault that people are."
287.0,288.0, It's all your fault.
288.0,289.0, It's not.
289.0,290.0," I mean, I just, yeah, I just saw it coming."
290.0,295.0, But it's actually a fun game because you know all the boring stuff that you associate with
295.0,299.0, MM was the walking here and there and the grinding and stuff because it plays like an action game.
299.0,303.0, It's actually entertaining and you can cross such a huge distance is so quickly in your car.
303.0,305.0, Randomly run over things.
305.0,307.0, It's a lot of fun.
307.0,309.0," I mean, the craftings a little broken though."
309.0,311.0, And I'm acting.
311.0,315.0," Yeah, there is some crafting that you build car parts and you do all this kind of like tweaking up your car."
315.0,316.0, I pretty much ignore all that.
316.0,317.0," I mean, I'm with Sean."
317.0,319.0, I'm on the breakdown server as well.
319.0,322.0, Maybe we should try to like have some kind of like massive fire flight at some point.
322.0,324.0," Yeah, see if you're playing, look us up on there."
324.0,332.0," We've, we're our, our clan is Mingo's Marauders named after Mingo, a random NPC wants us to go wipe out the"
332.0,336.0, populist of this canyon village and you go in there and it's nothing but a canyon filled with crates.
336.0,338.0, That's like some crazy crates that.
338.0,339.0, Yeah.
339.0,341.0," So we, we're like we're doing it."
341.0,344.0," We realize we probably killed a good, you know, five thousand these things these people."
344.0,346.0," And the kids are like, why are we doing this?"
346.0,347.0, Mingo said it.
347.0,349.0," Mingo just, let's a random guy out in the desert."
349.0,350.0," So we just were like, all right."
350.0,352.0," Well, but you guys really do like the game right?"
352.0,353.0, You're not.
353.0,354.0," It's, it's a lot of fun."
354.0,357.0," It's, it kind of has, it's just a straight up action game."
357.0,360.0," You, you, you, you, you take in jobs, you're shooting at things."
360.0,361.0," I, I, I'm serious."
361.0,363.0," I, I like, I mean, it's fun."
363.0,364.0, Have to fun.
364.0,367.0, I guess is kind of talking crap when you're playing and it's buggy.
367.0,369.0," It's, you know, a lot of stuff like that."
369.0,374.0," But also, sort of in its favor because they're so, maybe it's because there's so few players"
374.0,377.0, or NCSoft's custom or service is just really effective.
377.0,380.0," Anytime I've had a problem and I've, I've sent it into GM."
380.0,382.0, They've been there to help me right away.
382.0,384.0, They're probably just glad someone's helped.
384.0,385.0," Yeah, you did that extra attention."
385.0,387.0," But like I'm saying, yeah, it's a fun game."
387.0,391.0," I, I, I don't play so many, you know, straight MMOs because I, you know, I quickly"
391.0,394.0, tire of the grinding for the next thing.
394.0,398.0," But it's one where I'm still playing it, you know, week later and, and definitely enjoying"
398.0,399.0, it.
399.0,400.0, It's wish more people were there.
400.0,402.0," Now, I play with the gamepad or keyboard I'm else."
402.0,403.0, I play with keyboard mouse.
403.0,404.0, Yeah.
404.0,405.0, I do both.
405.0,406.0," It's actually, it actually works either way."
406.0,408.0, I feel bad for this game.
408.0,410.0, I think it's been hard to categorize.
410.0,413.0," And, and also it seems like it might be one of those games with benefit from a,"
413.0,415.0, a no monthly fee thing.
415.0,416.0, That's a huge part of it.
416.0,417.0," I think so yeah, like you lived there."
417.0,420.0, That's been the one main thing that's kept me out of D&D online.
420.0,422.0, This kept me out of World of Warcraft.
422.0,425.0," And all those are, it's like an extra 10 to 15 bucks a month."
425.0,426.0, Probably another thing.
426.0,427.0, Right.
427.0,429.0, You got a D&D online as a fact that it's crap.
429.0,432.0," But, well, that's not a small point."
432.0,438.0," Well, the one, the one trial time that I, that I did playing it, and the group that I was with"
438.0,440.0," is actually, you know, it's Lloyd's Friday night."
440.0,441.0, Follies.
441.0,442.0, Yeah.
442.0,443.0, That's a hip group.
443.0,444.0, Yeah.
444.0,447.0," So we're a bit, so I'll just mr."
447.0,448.0, I love you Lloyd.
448.0,449.0, Yeah.
449.0,450.0, I will explain that later.
450.0,452.0," But I mean, it was fun."
452.0,454.0, The interface was okay.
454.0,457.0, But it's not worth the extra 15 bucks a month to me.
457.0,458.0, It's really not.
458.0,459.0," Well, it's a big thing."
459.0,462.0," You're only going to be most people are going to be playing one, you know,"
462.0,464.0, MMO when it comes to that pay one monthly fee.
464.0,465.0, Yeah.
465.0,466.0," I think you had you in a mince, everybody."
466.0,469.0, You're the one that should get the 15 bucks.
469.0,471.0," You know, I should have done gun that route with it."
471.0,472.0," You know, the free."
472.0,473.0, Yeah.
473.0,476.0," And it's an instant and look, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, too,"
476.0,481.0," because anytime you're playing, you only run into five people anyway, which is still a good one."
481.0,483.0, Three shy of a guild or as party.
483.0,484.0, No.
484.0,490.0," But another thing about it, but others means that it's one of those MMOs that was trying something different."
490.0,491.0, We've called it before.
491.0,492.0, We've tried to make a mouse.
492.0,493.0, Yeah.
493.0,494.0, That's exactly what you know.
494.0,495.0, And CGW for the past months.
495.0,498.0," And we looked at, you know, what are some other options to get us out of the"
498.0,499.0, house?
499.0,500.0," You know, paradigm."
500.0,503.0," And it's a good example that, hey, it is possible."
503.0,505.0, But I don't know if it's going to prove physically possible.
505.0,508.0, Maybe people don't want out of the Gulf Goblin troll paradigm.
508.0,509.0, I don't know.
509.0,510.0, Are people ready for it?
510.0,512.0," I mean, how city of heroes doing?"
512.0,515.0," I mean, that was totally outside of the, that whole paradigm."
515.0,518.0," Well, that, but the city of heroes and silly, silly,"
518.0,521.0, city of villains is more still along the fantasy line.
521.0,522.0, That's true.
522.0,524.0, But it is different though.
524.0,526.0," I mean, because I mean, they're all when you look at it."
526.0,529.0," Like, uh, auto salt is essentially, you know,"
529.0,531.0, guild wars or whatever on wheels.
531.0,534.0," I mean, you have to put an engineer is your, is your major,"
534.0,535.0, your monk.
535.0,539.0," Your, your tank is an actual tank, you know, and it's like,"
539.0,543.0," basically, it follows the same, you know, the same format."
543.0,544.0, Yeah.
544.0,547.0," Well, maybe more people play."
547.0,549.0, What's the name of that server again?
549.0,550.0, Breakdown.
550.0,551.0, It's one of four.
551.0,553.0, It's the one that's low populated.
553.0,554.0," Right, right."
554.0,555.0, Very low.
555.0,556.0, That's very low.
556.0,557.0, Yeah.
557.0,559.0, It's actually tumble leads across the main screen as you're trying to
559.0,561.0," like, something, it was something like that."
561.0,564.0," If they want to pull people into the game, they should just make,"
564.0,565.0," make it, make it gratis."
565.0,566.0, Yeah.
566.0,569.0, Pay for this software and just let people go for it.
569.0,570.0, Right.
570.0,571.0," Well, they're probably, well, head that way, right."
571.0,574.0," Or at this point, all those four servers and collapse them in the"
574.0,575.0, ones.
575.0,579.0," So then we can, you know, have real battles running into people known then."
579.0,580.0, Yeah.
580.0,581.0," Well, I hope they'll stick around."
581.0,582.0, That's a fun game.
582.0,583.0, I like to see it grow.
583.0,584.0, That's for sure.
584.0,585.0, So we've also been playing the sin.
585.0,586.0, Definitely.
586.0,587.0, I've been playing a lot of sin.
587.0,588.0, How far do you help hard you get?
588.0,591.0, I guess I've passed the mutant boss battle.
591.0,595.0, The sin get better after the first minute that first opening cuts seeing what
595.0,598.0, the woman's breast is using your face there.
598.0,600.0," Oh, is it, it's, it's a little more subtle after that."
600.0,601.0, Yeah.
601.0,602.0, It is.
602.0,603.0, Okay.
603.0,604.0, It's just those first two moments.
604.0,605.0," You're like, yeah."
605.0,606.0, It was so much of an explain.
606.0,607.0," Like, my fiance is watching me play this game."
607.0,608.0, Yeah.
608.0,610.0," And like, of course, as the game starting and it's so hard to explain."
610.0,611.0," You see, this digitized woman in a bikini."
611.0,612.0," Like, just like, yeah."
612.0,617.0," I'm like, it's like the image comics, but you know, during the early 90s, image is changed"
617.0,619.0," and said, but it's definitely like of shooters."
619.0,620.0, It's the image comics of shooters.
620.0,632.0," You start off with the TNA and then the first thing you're carrying, the female character says is you're driving in a car to a guard is like, you know, hey, we're going to, you know, meet us at the corner of F and you or something like that."
632.0,633.0," Oh, yeah."
633.0,634.0," But, you know, that's edge."
634.0,635.0," Said, yeah."
635.0,636.0, Straight man.
636.0,637.0, It's kind of.
637.0,639.0, But it gets better after that.
640.0,642.0," But interestingly, there's a lot less story after that."
642.0,650.0," And this is one of my concerns with the game is that when, you know, we kept talking about is, is this a viable model, you know, episodic real, episodic content, right?"
650.0,652.0," And they, what are you paying for next?"
652.0,654.0," They needed, it was $20."
654.0,660.0," But of course, I think they needed to come out of the gate really strong with this because they need you to say, I have to come back and see what's next."
660.0,664.0," And you can't, you can't have any people there like, oh, I still haven't even finished the first episode."
664.0,665.0, Should I get the second one?
665.0,667.0, It has to get it to work.
667.0,668.0, You've got to be addicted.
668.0,673.0," And I think story is, and narrative is a great way to get people coming back, you know, leaving unanswered questions or what not."
673.0,682.0," But then as you start playing the game, the really isn't much there, you know, I mean, there's, there's stuff on the wall, there's cutscenes now and then."
682.0,685.0," But there's not really much of, you know, of a plot that I see."
685.0,690.0," It's a lot of shoes, you guys that come out that wear the same yellow and black jumpsuit."
690.0,693.0," Yeah, there's, there's different, you know, I agree with you."
693.0,697.0," I think it's a lot, a lot of the similar monster, you know, and bad guys you're going up against."
697.0,705.0," And the, and what's the story is kind of slow going, if you make it to the, the syn, the syn tech headquarters or whatever it is one of the places."
705.0,708.0," It's, it's so disposable to plot right now."
708.0,710.0, But there is a story there.
710.0,713.0," It's just, they're kind of stringing it out so far between."
713.0,714.0, Right.
714.0,717.0," And the thing is, I'm actually going through the trouble of exploring every nook and cranny of the game."
717.0,720.0, So I'm actually like stretching out the experience longer than most people.
720.0,727.0, I think I've been to I've been calling every single phone number looking in the controller and I'm not finding all I'm finding or one off gags.
727.0,728.0, Exactly.
728.0,736.0," I'm not finding any, you know, I'm not rifle, you know, if someone's cabinets and finding some backstory or file that lets me into the process like I was lead to believe what happened."
736.0,742.0," Or talking or calling my radio to talk to, to Jessica and other, you know, the other NPCs instead."
742.0,747.0," It's a lot of really funny gags like in one case, there's the one about extension x graphics tension expert right."
747.0,751.0," And you want to fill that in and what's the, you know, you know, you don't fill the joke though."
751.0,752.0, Okay.
752.0,753.0, All right.
753.0,754.0, We'll look for the number.
754.0,755.0, It's one 999.
755.0,758.0, What is the general synopsis for this game though?
758.0,760.0," You know, shoot stuff."
760.0,762.0," That's basically a three weapons, you shoot stuff."
762.0,763.0, Okay.
763.0,766.0, There's kind of an original take for a game.
766.0,769.0," It's some decent, you know, it's some decent AI and level design."
769.0,770.0, I like it.
770.0,772.0," Yeah, actually, I like the layout and it's good start."
772.0,774.0, But just I feel like there was more of a story that could have been there.
774.0,776.0," It's not phenomenal, you know."
776.0,777.0, Right.
777.0,780.0," What you said before about, you know, the needing the hooks to keep going to the next one."
780.0,784.0," I mean, that they need to learn from things like 24 or lost, right?"
784.0,787.0, Where you where it ends and you just can't wait to get to that next piece.
787.0,790.0," I mean, there's probably just like good enough writers on this game."
790.0,791.0, Yeah.
791.0,794.0," And it's what it's why I think I'm coming at it a little more skeptical than usual, you know,"
794.0,799.0, just because it's like I need to be that phenomenal to get us to come back.
799.0,800.0," The back, the back story is there."
800.0,802.0," I mean, it's not like they haven't done their homework."
802.0,804.0, It's just the thing is they didn't like put two and two together.
804.0,808.0," If you remember from like Doom 3 or half life 2, you can go anywhere in the world."
808.0,810.0, You can find these little elements.
810.0,814.0, Doom 3 was the PDA and they all this backstory stuff that filled in some blanks.
814.0,817.0," And then in half life 2 was like, you know, little,"
817.0,818.0, Q was in the world.
818.0,819.0, You can interact with.
819.0,821.0," And they just needed, they need more of that in this game."
821.0,822.0, Right.
822.0,826.0," And what what half life 2 is guy going for it when the episode comes out is it's got such a big,"
826.0,831.0," well known, it clearly defined over our question that's lingering."
831.0,833.0, Not only what happened since the last one.
833.0,839.0," They've already got us there, but also it's just, you know, you were still asking who the hell is this guy pulling the strings behind it."
839.0,841.0," And so I mean, I think that'll be a big help for them."
841.0,843.0," And if they play that off the right way,"
843.0,847.0," and you see, you know, you want to know what happened to dog and all these other characters from it."
847.0,850.0," And these are things that, sin at least, if you weren't, you know,"
850.0,854.0, die hard into the original game that came out back when it's not going to be with.
854.0,855.0, We was right.
855.0,856.0, 12 people.
856.0,858.0," I mean, who even remembers that game."
858.0,861.0," I remember the game, but I don't remember getting that hooked on it,"
861.0,865.0," but still, I don't want, I'm not going to put it on any spoilers out there."
865.0,868.0," And I'm, I think I'm getting close to the end of the first episode."
868.0,872.0," There is one point that could be a cool jump off for the next episode,"
872.0,874.0, just a matter of how they end this one.
874.0,878.0, Because it was already like the mutant boss you're talking about.
878.0,879.0, You fight him again.
879.0,880.0," Oh, great."
880.0,882.0," So it's like, let's rehash the same as that."
882.0,887.0," On the good side for it, I like jumping into it knowing that it wasn't going to be very long."
887.0,888.0," We talked about, right, the length."
888.0,891.0," And it was cool to say, like, I've got one day here."
891.0,894.0," I've got an afternoon and I don't have to jump into this and like, you know,"
894.0,895.0, like a oblivion.
895.0,897.0, I hear you about all this time to it.
897.0,901.0, Another thing quickly on that is the dynamic difficulty adjustment.
901.0,905.0, We're basically the game is looking at how well you're playing and ramping itself up according to that's nice.
905.0,909.0," At first, it was a little too steep because if you did a few head shots,"
909.0,911.0, it would come at you immediately.
911.0,912.0, And it was being possible.
912.0,914.0," They'd be pissed of sniping you from, you know,"
914.0,917.0," a thousand yards, but they patched it since then."
917.0,920.0, And I think it's really as one of the stronger features of the game.
920.0,921.0, How long is it?
921.0,923.0, I think people are saying that it's anywhere between six.
923.0,925.0," Yeah, six hours roughly."
925.0,927.0, Here here for shorter games.
927.0,928.0, But cheaper games too.
928.0,931.0," But yes, it's a price appropriately."
931.0,932.0, Yeah.
932.0,936.0, So I've been playing heroes five a week and here's a mitematic five.
936.0,940.0," And I'm liking it a lot better than four, which I thought was terrible."
940.0,944.0," But now I'm getting a little sourd, I have to say,"
944.0,946.0, because it's just not done.
946.0,948.0, This game needs a pillage.
948.0,949.0, Pretty bad.
949.0,950.0, Yeah.
950.0,956.0, Our contributing editor Matt Pekom was mentioning that it took him about seven hours before he was really getting into it.
956.0,959.0," Yeah, which seems like a, I don't know, I'm not used to that."
959.0,961.0," It seems like almost backwards, you know."
961.0,962.0, It's pretty steep.
962.0,965.0," And I got stuck at one mission that took me,"
966.0,971.0, I swear probably 15 to 20 hours to finish this one mission.
971.0,973.0, The map was huge.
973.0,976.0, That it was impossibly difficult on the normal setting.
976.0,979.0," And I thought maybe I'm just stupid or something, but actually went to the first form."
979.0,980.0, And that's the one mission.
980.0,984.0," You know how some games have a mission where everyone's just like, how the hell do I beat this mission?"
984.0,985.0, Right.
985.0,987.0, That's the one where I was glad that that was there.
987.0,993.0," But, but there's a like totally random, totally random stupid bugs."
993.0,996.0," Like, you know, you're, you're looking at your army."
996.0,1001.0," And this is like hard game to describe if you haven't played it, but you know, you have an army of characters."
1001.0,1005.0," And they're listed by number of units, you know, literally a number."
1005.0,1008.0, Like you have 84 goblins.
1008.0,1012.0," Well, there's a bug so that the numbers are off."
1012.0,1014.0, Once you start fighting.
1014.0,1016.0," But that's, that's key to the whole strategy."
1016.0,1017.0, Right.
1017.0,1021.0, Because I need to know I have 84 goblins going against whatever 64 steel.
1021.0,1023.0," But if you're like, you're right now."
1023.0,1025.0, I need to know how many goblins I have.
1025.0,1026.0, But you really do.
1026.0,1028.0," I mean, it kind of messes with the whole game."
1028.0,1031.0," If the numbers are wrong, it's all about the numbers."
1031.0,1033.0," So, I don't know."
1033.0,1034.0," Kind of, kind of unhappy there."
1034.0,1037.0," I mean, was it pretty obvious that it was rushed out the doors and something like that?"
1037.0,1038.0," Well, that's what it makes you feel."
1038.0,1041.0," I mean, there's a post on the official form that the header is like,"
1041.0,1044.0, So what exactly did the play testers test?
1044.0,1046.0," You know, and that's exactly how I felt."
1046.0,1049.0," I mean, it was such a basic thing that's wrong."
1049.0,1051.0, It just makes you wonder.
1051.0,1053.0," Say, say, that's patch tomorrow."
1053.0,1055.0, What's your take on the game then?
1055.0,1057.0," If it's patched, I'm completely happy."
1057.0,1060.0," I mean, because I like it even with these annoyances."
1060.0,1063.0," You know, I can sort of remember in my head how many goblins I have."
1063.0,1065.0," You know, it's goblins."
1065.0,1066.0, But last night.
1066.0,1069.0, He actually has a goblin count.
1069.0,1071.0, I click so I'll be talking.
1071.0,1073.0, I just lost another 20.
1073.0,1074.0, Ready?
1074.0,1076.0," It's pretty, pretty."
1077.0,1079.0," Okay, so let's move on from that."
1079.0,1082.0, I know Ryan wants to talk about lost.
1082.0,1084.0, We got the official announcement today.
1084.0,1085.0, Was it?
1085.0,1086.0, Yep.
1086.0,1091.0, That Ubisoft's snatched up the license for a lost video game.
1091.0,1094.0, And we know how many people are watching that show right now.
1094.0,1096.0, Have the world this?
1096.0,1097.0, Have the world.
1097.0,1101.0," So not a bad move on their part, but will the game be any good?"
1101.0,1104.0, I have a lot of people watching the game.
1104.0,1107.0, I think they got the CSI three three dimensions of murder.
1107.0,1110.0," Okay, can we think of one TV show that turned into a good game?"
1110.0,1112.0, Desperate housewives.
1112.0,1114.0," No, it's enough."
1114.0,1115.0, And that's not out yet.
1115.0,1116.0, Don't laugh.
1116.0,1117.0, It could be good.
1117.0,1118.0, That's true.
1118.0,1120.0, I don't know if there's any precedent for a good.
1120.0,1121.0," Well, 24."
1121.0,1122.0, 24.
1122.0,1123.0, Good reviews.
1123.0,1124.0, I think it's getting like seven.
1124.0,1125.0, It's pretty average kind of stuff.
1125.0,1126.0, It was all right.
1126.0,1128.0, What do you think Ryan?
1128.0,1129.0, I don't know.
1129.0,1132.0, I'm having terrible visions of the ER game.
1132.0,1135.0," Well, the only saving grace for me here is that it's you be Montreal."
1135.0,1136.0, They don't make crap.
1136.0,1137.0, At least not generally.
1137.0,1138.0, Not usually.
1138.0,1139.0," So what would you, yeah?"
1139.0,1142.0, I want to know there's so many questions about the game in tail.
1142.0,1143.0, Right.
1143.0,1147.0, If it's not getting the duct tape in the cat hair to rub together and do this or
1147.0,1148.0, Right.
1148.0,1149.0," You know, to get through the gate."
1149.0,1150.0," Oh, so you play Gabriel might as well."
1150.0,1151.0, Yeah.
1151.0,1153.0, That was a great night.
1153.0,1154.0, Three wasn't it?
1154.0,1155.0, It's a tape.
1155.0,1156.0, It's a tape.
1156.0,1157.0," No, to lose."
1157.0,1158.0, You had to make glue to make the fake.
1158.0,1159.0, It makes it a fun.
1159.0,1161.0, I thought you used syrup syrup.
1161.0,1162.0, That's what it was.
1162.0,1163.0, It's a hair.
1163.0,1164.0, It's gone.
1164.0,1169.0," But why I was talking with one of one of one of the guys earlier today and he was like,"
1169.0,1170.0," You know, what are you going to do?"
1170.0,1173.0, Just like see something weird and then not tell one of the NPCs about it.
1173.0,1176.0," Well, you want to the regular like sweat hogs."
1176.0,1180.0," You know, one of the main characters or you like the bat one of those background guys."
1180.0,1181.0, I think it'd be cool.
1181.0,1182.0," Yeah, if you were just like plainly."
1182.0,1183.0, I don't know.
1183.0,1184.0, Maybe I survived.
1184.0,1185.0, Yeah.
1185.0,1186.0," Dude, I would be hurley."
1186.0,1187.0, Who would you want to be?
1187.0,1188.0, If you got to be one of those guys.
1188.0,1189.0, That's how you guys are.
1189.0,1190.0, Hurley.
1190.0,1191.0, Hurley.
1191.0,1192.0, You'd want to be hurley.
1192.0,1193.0, That's who they all think we are.
1193.0,1195.0, I mean gamers are all right.
1195.0,1197.0, I probably want to be lock.
1197.0,1198.0, You want to be what's her name?
1198.0,1199.0, The DUI girl.
1199.0,1201.0, I got a red riggas.
1201.0,1203.0, Big big killed her on the show.
1203.0,1204.0," Oh, wait."
1204.0,1205.0, This is boy.
1205.0,1206.0," Dude, come on."
1206.0,1207.0," Okay, that was two weeks ago."
1207.0,1208.0," I guess it's, I guess it's fair."
1208.0,1209.0, Yeah.
1209.0,1210.0, Yeah.
1210.0,1211.0, I'd want to go echo.
1211.0,1214.0," You know, tap your inner soul man."
1214.0,1215.0, Mm-hmm.
1215.0,1216.0," Yes, it were."
1216.0,1217.0, Or lock.
1217.0,1221.0," I mean, I mean, I'd be like, you guys, you guys, some additional, you know,"
1221.0,1222.0, peats to the puzzle that can get.
1222.0,1225.0, Probably what everybody's going to be hoping for.
1225.0,1226.0, But they won't.
1226.0,1228.0," Complaining at the same time, too."
1228.0,1231.0," I mean, because it's just like you've got to buy, yeah."
1231.0,1234.0, Infinite crisis tie at number 47.
1234.0,1235.0, They won't do that.
1235.0,1237.0," The last people, I don't know if you guys are reading"
1237.0,1240.0, the last ones of the people who watch the show are pretty obsessed.
1240.0,1242.0," Well, they're selling something novel."
1242.0,1243.0, That's a tie in and it's right.
1243.0,1244.0, Yeah.
1244.0,1245.0, They have to read the name.
1245.0,1248.0," I mean, is it called or, but evil twin, I forget what it's called."
1248.0,1250.0," Yeah, but how does that tie in those?"
1250.0,1253.0," Like, are you missing something if you don't read the book?"
1253.0,1254.0, Apparently not.
1254.0,1258.0," So, I mean, hopefully they followed the same kind of theory with the, with the, with the game."
1258.0,1263.0," The novel, it's something that was like, that it's a manuscript that's found on the plane"
1263.0,1265.0, on in the TV show.
1265.0,1266.0, And hurley's reading the manuscript.
1266.0,1270.0, And so now they're selling that book as a novel in real life.
1270.0,1274.0," And apparently in that novel, they have these sort of like cutesy references"
1274.0,1278.0," like one of the characters, Manson's John Locke, the philosopher, which is of course,"
1278.0,1280.0, an email into the main characters on the show.
1280.0,1282.0," So they sort of have these, ah ha!"
1282.0,1284.0, That's just like on the TV show moments.
1284.0,1286.0, For those who are stupid enough to buy the book.
1286.0,1290.0," When they're using their goblin counter, they're a lot of other books in the show"
1290.0,1294.0," that like, they'll show them in the show and people will go out and buy them"
1294.0,1297.0, just because they're hoping they can get a clue by reading the book that was
1297.0,1298.0, mentioned in the show.
1298.0,1299.0, Right.
1299.0,1302.0," I had to the precedent here, probably not good."
1302.0,1306.0," I mean, just if you look at the history here of TV shows as games."
1306.0,1308.0, But maybe this one will be different.
1308.0,1310.0," I don't know, Ryan will buy it."
1310.0,1316.0," By the way, can we mention the fact that because Ryan sitting here, I didn't actually shoot Ryan."
1316.0,1319.0, Because I'm really needing to be said.
1319.0,1325.0," Because we did that as a sort of joke promo piece for other podcasts, and I guess a few people"
1325.0,1326.0, out there were offended.
1326.0,1328.0," Yeah, to the guy that sent us that email, it's okay."
1328.0,1330.0, I'm still alive.
1331.0,1332.0, Help him.
1332.0,1334.0," What do you say, Scott?"
1334.0,1336.0, I'm just shocked.
1336.0,1338.0, I'm honestly shocked.
1338.0,1339.0, Yeah.
1339.0,1341.0, Was it one person was just that one dude?
1341.0,1343.0," As far as I know it's just that one dude, you never know."
1343.0,1346.0," I mean, it could be like, oh, I'm never going to listen to this again."
1346.0,1347.0, Because they're going to kill people.
1347.0,1349.0," And it's like, oh, please, people get over it."
1349.0,1351.0, It's a gag.
1353.0,1354.0, Okay.
1354.0,1356.0," So, I was a bit of art for that."
1356.0,1360.0," Yeah, we've got all sorts of cool, fun gadgets at CGW lately."
1360.0,1362.0," That's always, that's always a good time."
1362.0,1364.0, What little toys have you guys been getting?
1364.0,1367.0," Well, it's kind of offshoots from being at E3."
1367.0,1370.0, We got a chance to sneak in through Kenshin Hall.
1370.0,1371.0, You always see some cool stuff.
1371.0,1375.0," Now, I know Sean was hooked on the, was it the gaming mouse too?"
1375.0,1377.0, And with not the frag pedals that came with it.
1377.0,1378.0, It's the gaming mouse.
1378.0,1379.0, The gaming mouse.
1379.0,1382.0," And then, first off, I'm going to talk about it."
1382.0,1383.0, I thought we were going to talk about it.
1383.0,1385.0," No, I was going to say the best for that."
1385.0,1387.0," So, the game that no one felt about it."
1387.0,1388.0, That's the how to control it.
1388.0,1391.0," So, the gaming mouse, to mouse, design for gaming."
1391.0,1397.0," But, I know, it's basically rather than, you know, the usual way that a mouse works where you're moving your wrist and your arm."
1397.0,1399.0, All you're moving are your fingers.
1399.0,1400.0, It's a small round thing.
1400.0,1402.0, You hold between your thumb and forefinger.
1402.0,1404.0," And so, it's very sensitive."
1404.0,1405.0, The slightest movement.
1405.0,1407.0," It's like a hockey puck size, right?"
1407.0,1408.0, Just really.
1408.0,1409.0, That makes it sound bad.
1409.0,1410.0," That makes it, no, it's smaller than that."
1410.0,1413.0," That makes it sound like the Mac mouse, which is horrible."
1413.0,1415.0," The hockey puck, hockey puck thing."
1415.0,1416.0," So, it's really sensitive."
1416.0,1420.0, It has buttons on the side where you're thumb and pointer finger touch.
1420.0,1424.0," But, just because of it, what I liked about it was that, you know, small movements were very precise."
1424.0,1432.0," It was easy to aim at, but then, for a game like a battle field where you're switching between on-foot play to a jet or something."
1432.0,1436.0," And a lot of people ordinarily there, what's switched over to a controller or a flight stick."
1436.0,1440.0," So, you can, you know, do e-mails and more complicated maneuvers."
1440.0,1446.0," You can just do it with a mouse because you just move it a little bit further on the desk and, you know, just like a few millimeters."
1446.0,1453.0," And that's the equivalent of like, moving, picking your mouse up several times off the pad and swinging to the left and then putting them back down and continuing that."
1453.0,1457.0," So, I just thought that was pretty neat for that reason in terms of being effective."
1457.0,1460.0," And it comes with some, if you want to buy them, it comes with some foot pedals."
1460.0,1462.0, Which I don't know about those.
1462.0,1465.0," I mean, I guess for jumping or something, if you really need to touch it."
1465.0,1467.0," Or if you're a drummer and a duff leopard, you're just right."
1467.0,1477.0," But pedals, I mean, like, what, like accelerating and a racing game, those different pedals are jumping fire in, in a unreal tournament."
1477.0,1478.0, Really? Yeah.
1478.0,1480.0, But I don't know. I don't know.
1480.0,1483.0, And that's kind of when it's time to go outside.
1483.0,1487.0," I think it's 80 bucks for that thing, too."
1487.0,1488.0, That's really rough.
1488.0,1490.0, But you don't have to get the foot pedal.
1490.0,1491.0," Oh, no, no."
1491.0,1495.0," I thought, you know, when I told people that the gaming mouse is cool, all they could think about were the foot pedals and were laughing."
1495.0,1496.0," I mean, what?"
1496.0,1499.0," Well, there are push-ups and foot pedals if you're in a relationship."
1499.0,1501.0, You just can't. You can't bring that home.
1501.0,1503.0," But at this time, it's really hard."
1503.0,1505.0," So, a haptic device that we're about to go out and crazy for."
1505.0,1509.0," That is, it looks even worse. It looks like some dental cleaner that sits on your lap."
1509.0,1512.0," Seriously, it looks like something like out of a torch, it looks like a torture device."
1512.0,1518.0," But it is, by far, the coolest thing I saw at the show, like way revolutionary controller, forget the we remote control."
1518.0,1520.0, This is the shit.
1520.0,1522.0, You can't say that.
1522.0,1523.0," Oh, yeah, you can."
1523.0,1524.0, I don't want you to say that.
1524.0,1525.0, It's just stuff.
1525.0,1526.0, It is.
1526.0,1527.0, It is.
1527.0,1528.0," It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just shit."
1528.0,1529.0, Yeah.
1529.0,1530.0, Okay.
1530.0,1531.0, Word dog.
1531.0,1535.0," Anyway, no, but it's like, it's meant as a mouse replacement."
1535.0,1538.0," And it operates in like, it's a haptic device where operates in free space."
1538.0,1542.0," So, basically, you push in, you move out, moving out all directions."
1542.0,1543.0, It can convey weight.
1543.0,1545.0," Wait, so you don't, you hold it."
1545.0,1546.0, You hold it.
1546.0,1547.0, It doesn't sit on the desk.
1547.0,1551.0," No, no, it's a haptic real quick, just means of or pertaining to the sense of touch."
1551.0,1552.0, Thank you.
1552.0,1553.0, Dr. Ali.
1553.0,1554.0, I wear our Webster moment.
1554.0,1555.0, Yeah.
1555.0,1558.0," Hey, well, a lot of people are going to be like, have what?"
1558.0,1559.0, Half-lo.
1559.0,1560.0," So, go on."
1560.0,1562.0," No, it's, it was kind of crazy."
1562.0,1563.0," So, they had some base."
1563.0,1566.0," I'll just, you know, the best way to describe it is with tech depth, with demos that I played."
1566.0,1569.0," So, they have one, like, it's like a basketball, like a tech demo."
1569.0,1573.0," And actually, you can feel the ball in your hand as you're lifting up the knob and just,"
1573.0,1575.0," and you hit a, you know, hold on, like, you know, left-right mouse buttons."
1575.0,1576.0, And you release the mouse button.
1576.0,1578.0, And you can feel the ball leaving your hand.
1578.0,1579.0," Like, as if you're taking the shot."
1579.0,1581.0, It does sound a little like the Wii controller.
1581.0,1582.0, It is not.
1582.0,1583.0," No, it's not."
1583.0,1585.0, It's attached to your desk.
1585.0,1586.0, It sits on your desk.
1586.0,1588.0, And there's a little arms that come off of it.
1588.0,1590.0," So, you just kind of moving it around."
1590.0,1593.0," And then when you're, go to, jump to a first-person shooter."
1593.0,1594.0, That's a lot better example.
1594.0,1597.0," So, they had a half-life tomb on it with it."
1597.0,1600.0," And now you're, you're, you should have 357 mag them."
1600.0,1602.0, And you feel the kick back on the gun.
1602.0,1605.0," But again, you have to say, I mean, people are probably thinking, you know, they're making"
1605.0,1608.0, the inevitable analogy to a rumble pad in a controller.
1608.0,1609.0," No, it's not like that at all."
1610.0,1614.0," I mean, you feel basically what it is is a little ball attached to three arms."
1614.0,1617.0, And then there's a servo motor behind each of those arms.
1617.0,1619.0, And they're running in different degrees of resistance.
1619.0,1622.0," So, because of that, without having any weights or inside there, they're able to create"
1622.0,1623.0, that resistance.
1623.0,1625.0," So, it's your holding a gun or a crowbar."
1625.0,1627.0, You feel the different weights in your hand.
1627.0,1630.0," You know, obviously it's not exact one for one because you're going to charge, you know,"
1630.0,1632.0, fatigued in a second.
1632.0,1636.0," But so, if you're hitting a crowbar against a chain like fence, it, it, it resists"
1636.0,1640.0, the different feeling that if you're hitting mortar or something or shooting a shot.
1640.0,1641.0, It's less.
1641.0,1642.0, Right.
1642.0,1643.0, It's a smitty finish.
1643.0,1645.0," And then when you use the physics in there, just have to have straight objects."
1645.0,1649.0," You can feel them, you know, and the neat thing is it's not just a uniform weight."
1649.0,1653.0," All of a sudden it becomes heavier, but it becomes heavy in relation to a full"
1653.0,1654.0, crum.
1654.0,1658.0," So, if you say if you grabbed a ball on a rope and you swung it around, you can feel this"
1658.0,1661.0," and tributal force pulling it has the ball passes around, you know, pass it around."
1661.0,1662.0, That's right.
1662.0,1663.0, I just want someone else playing that demo.
1663.0,1664.0, I didn't get a chance.
1664.0,1666.0," I just want to say, how much is this contraption?"
1666.0,1669.0," Well, that's the thing is they're targeting, having to go for a hundred bucks when it comes"
1669.0,1670.0, out into it.
1670.0,1671.0, Okay.
1671.0,1674.0," And so, it's trying to, like, it's going to have an initial run for a hundred fifty,"
1674.0,1677.0," probably by the end of this year, then, then, when it goes into full mass production,"
1677.0,1679.0," hundred bucks by, like, early 2007."
1679.0,1683.0," The other neat thing about is that it totally, you get that sense of texture."
1683.0,1686.0," You do the demo where you run your, like, we're going to running your hand over balls of"
1686.0,1687.0, various services.
1687.0,1691.0," So, it could be corrugated, it could be sandpaper, it could be ice, and you definitely"
1691.0,1693.0," feel, as if you'd run it."
1693.0,1694.0," It would be like, probably across the end of cool."
1694.0,1698.0," So, in a game, I mean, just take splinter cell right off the bat, like, you know, the lock"
1698.0,1701.0," picking or something, and it could feel or hot wearing a car or something we saw in a"
1701.0,1702.0, loan in the dark.
1702.0,1706.0," I mean, it would feel like you could feel the texture is naturally match it up that way,"
1706.0,1710.0," and it would be entirely, it would be a whole little layer of touch rather than, you know,"
1710.0,1712.0, any correlating anything on screen.
1712.0,1715.0," And they sort of like, when they modded the Half Life 2 for the show,"
1715.0,1719.0," it only took one programmer, like, it can maybe, like, I think, like, a week or two."
1719.0,1720.0, Right.
1720.0,1723.0," So, I mean, like, that's just one guy doing it, but if you had, like, a whole, you know,"
1723.0,1728.0," a whole team of guys dedicated, creating the algorithm for the different, it's a problem."
1728.0,1732.0," I mean, when we just did our interface story with PC is that we can't ever have someone, you know,"
1732.0,1735.0, outside of Microsoft uniformly and foreign to interface.
1735.0,1736.0, That's the thing.
1736.0,1740.0," And because of it, it's like, it has to reach critical mass somehow, but how is it going to do it?"
1740.0,1744.0," Unless it's attached to, you know, in less, you know, Christech says, hey,"
1744.0,1746.0," Christ's 3 is made for this thing, right?"
1746.0,1748.0, And you can get it when you pre-order.
1748.0,1752.0," And if there's some way like that to get into it, I guess consoles do that a little better, huh?"
1752.0,1756.0," I mean, you can't make it, you buy the, you know, the music, whatever it is."
1756.0,1757.0, The arachas or the.
1757.0,1758.0, Right.
1758.0,1762.0," And a developer, you know, and it's kind of like that symbiosis where you've got to get a good"
1762.0,1765.0," developer who says, let's look at this and, like, like, the very best, you know,"
1765.0,1769.0," Nintendo DS games or the Wii games that really stand out, are the ones where the developers"
1769.0,1772.0, program specifically for that interface.
1772.0,1777.0," Now, of course, that's, you know, you can on suicide for any program to do a for a device that, like,"
1777.0,1778.0, ten people have.
1778.0,1781.0," Right. And maybe, maybe just too much of an uphill battle."
1781.0,1784.0," I mean, look at the whole history of PC gaming in the scenes, so, like, practically every"
1784.0,1789.0," controller, other than keyboard mouse fails, even when Microsoft puts it out."
1789.0,1791.0," You know, they couldn't make their sidewinder's work."
1791.0,1793.0," I mean, do they even make controllers anymore?"
1793.0,1796.0," Other than the Xbox 360, you see, they can't even, they can't even, they can't even"
1796.0,1799.0," Yeah, they can sell it into the game, but, you know, I think one way they could do it is if they"
1800.0,1805.0," make a reasonably priced product, like, you know, if you look at how much people are paying for these high end gaming mice,"
1805.0,1807.0," I mean, they're going for as much as 70, 80 bucks."
1807.0,1808.0, Yeah.
1808.0,1811.0," If you could justify giving somebody that, and that's just a gaming mouse."
1811.0,1812.0, That's it.
1812.0,1813.0, Yeah.
1813.0,1817.0," If you can hit give a really unique experience and not make it that much more than, you pay for a gaming mouse."
1817.0,1820.0, I could see some people who wanted to get into it.
1820.0,1821.0, Yeah.
1821.0,1823.0," The best case scenario is when this thing comes out at the end of the year,"
1823.0,1827.0, don't have it coded so that it will work with a wide variety of games.
1827.0,1832.0," People already have an ill-enhanced of the fives on those, and then in dream land, you sell enough of them,"
1832.0,1837.0," so that someone, you know, warrants, petrists, someone can come out and say, hey, or like the guys that like Mark's"
1837.0,1841.0," Healy who did, right, dog kung fu on steam will come out and say, hey, let's make a game for this."
1841.0,1842.0, Right.
1842.0,1843.0, You need to get the killer app.
1843.0,1844.0, Absolutely.
1844.0,1850.0," You need like a bio-shock or something or crisis or something to say, to use it completely, right, organically."
1850.0,1855.0," When I talk to people at the show, they said that they do, that they are looking to provide this,"
1855.0,1858.0," you know, code based to help people out, just throw it into their games."
1858.0,1859.0, Right.
1859.0,1862.0," And it wasn't just, there was actually a lot of buzz about that device at the show."
1862.0,1864.0," I mean, if you look around, it was on like, you know,"
1864.0,1869.0," API picked an AP picked it up, bunch of places, and can you send me the info?"
1869.0,1870.0, I want to pitch it for DLTV.
1870.0,1871.0, Sure.
1871.0,1872.0, Yeah.
1872.0,1873.0, It's one of those things.
1873.0,1874.0, It's totally my check it out.
1874.0,1878.0," You know, as soon as you try it, it's what you just kind of like marvel at technology, and it's just"
1878.0,1879.0, fun and it's gearing.
1879.0,1881.0, And you want to go tell someone about it.
1881.0,1884.0," And it was especially that way because it was in Ketchahol, just known for being the place."
1884.0,1888.0," Where, you know, but I guess you throw enough sticks together to make a spark down there once"
1888.0,1891.0," in the wall, and they did, you know, actually, you just have, I mean, at least one or two"
1891.0,1893.0, good things come out of there every year.
1893.0,1894.0, Yeah.
1894.0,1895.0, All right.
1895.0,1898.0," Well, Scott, the engineer is giving me the little wrap-up sign."
1898.0,1899.0," Well, I was just going move on."
1899.0,1901.0, I'll move on from this boring topic.
1901.0,1904.0," Oh, not from the boring topic, but you don't you have some emails and stuff?"
1904.0,1905.0, Do we?
1905.0,1906.0, We have one.
1906.0,1907.0, How long are we?
1907.0,1908.0, How much better to talk to us?
1908.0,1910.0," You got about, you're up around 30."
1910.0,1912.0, We're up at 30 minutes.
1913.0,1915.0," Okay. Well, we'll address one question."
1915.0,1919.0, We have a few and folks keep asking even if we don't answer them all.
1919.0,1921.0," We just, you know, we'll get to them eventually."
1921.0,1923.0," Oh, and one other order of business."
1923.0,1928.0," Those who responded to my requests for the tarot cards, the hero's five tarot cards."
1928.0,1932.0," We have our winners and as I told you guys, it's just going to take a little time post."
1932.0,1933.0, You three to get the mail down.
1933.0,1934.0, It went.
1934.0,1935.0, What are coming?
1935.0,1938.0," We'll have to come up with the contest for all those guilders, the boards."
1938.0,1941.0," We have the, uh, the, uh, the, the sticks around."
1941.0,1942.0, Right.
1942.0,1944.0," We're going to have a giveaway not this week, but stay tuned."
1944.0,1947.0," We're going to give away some, uh, what are they called e-boards?"
1947.0,1948.0, As e-boards?
1948.0,1950.0," We bought the, with the guilders factions overlays as well."
1950.0,1955.0," So I'll, I'll send one to anybody who volunteers me to run, run, run me through"
1955.0,1958.0, The last missions in the original campaign.
1958.0,1960.0, We're trying to get my right through.
1960.0,1961.0, There you have it.
1961.0,1964.0," We've got shirts and, uh, premigides to go with us to, right?"
1964.0,1967.0, We've got all sorts of guilders loot to give away.
1967.0,1968.0," And I'm sure by next week, why does more shots?"
1968.0,1969.0, We've got shirts.
1969.0,1970.0, The one that's on the right.
1970.0,1972.0, You don't get to where the shirt that we donated.
1972.0,1977.0," And, and mind you guys, the, the, the extra that we decided the rest of us were like, you know what?"
1977.0,1978.0, Let's give this back to the readers.
1978.0,1979.0," We don't need it, right?"
1979.0,1980.0, Right.
1980.0,1981.0, Right.
1981.0,1982.0, And put that shirt right on.
1982.0,1984.0," I took a book, put that in this backpack."
1984.0,1985.0, I did.
1985.0,1987.0, Took a couple extra shirts.
1987.0,1989.0, I could wear a different get-wars shirt.
1989.0,1990.0, Okay.
1991.0,1992.0," Oh, I'll put a few-"
1992.0,1994.0," If you say I got all this one, then stay."
1994.0,1995.0, Okay.
1995.0,1996.0, So we're going to read that.
1996.0,2001.0," We're going to read an excerpt from one reader's question, um, which where did it go?"
2001.0,2004.0," Uh, no, I don't think we're going to read that one, right?"
2004.0,2006.0, It's not the one about doing cover stories.
2006.0,2007.0, We're going to save that.
2007.0,2008.0, Because that's a big topic.
2008.0,2009.0, We'll say that.
2009.0,2010.0," Um, it was this one."
2010.0,2011.0," Uh, okay."
2011.0,2014.0," This comes from Fred Vuflow, Oliver."
2014.0,2017.0," Uh, out in, uh, cue garden hills."
2017.0,2018.0, New York.
2018.0,2021.0," And he asks, uh, why aren't old games for dead systems."
2021.0,2023.0, He's talking about console games.
2023.0,2026.0, Like the Sega Saturn and Dreamcast release to PC.
2026.0,2032.0, Why aren't consumer from the emulators created to unlock this to be played on desktops and laptops?
2032.0,2035.0, Why doesn't your publication do more reviews on beat them up type games?
2035.0,2036.0, Okay.
2036.0,2037.0, Okay.
2037.0,2038.0," Well, that's kind of random."
2038.0,2039.0, Yeah.
2039.0,2040.0, That's kind of random.
2040.0,2042.0," But, um, what do we think about that?"
2042.0,2043.0, Sorry.
2043.0,2044.0, The flow.
2044.0,2045.0, Sorry.
2045.0,2046.0, Sorry.
2046.0,2047.0, Sorry.
2047.0,2048.0, Sorry.
2048.0,2049.0, Sorry.
2049.0,2050.0, Sorry.
2050.0,2051.0, Mr. The flow.
2051.0,2053.0," Well, the console games, uh, old console games on PC."
2053.0,2056.0," Well, idea or not, you can get plenty of old console games on PC."
2056.0,2059.0, You mean through emulators and may it's stuff like that?
2059.0,2060.0, Not legally.
2060.0,2062.0," Well, what about like, uh, remember, I don't remember,"
2062.0,2063.0, Blame.
2063.0,2065.0," What about, uh, that didn't go anywhere."
2065.0,2068.0," Well, it did go somewhere, but it's so many shut it down."
2068.0,2069.0, Right.
2069.0,2070.0," I mean, like that, that flueless."
2070.0,2072.0, That was legal for like five seconds.
2072.0,2074.0," I mean, his key word here, like, you know,"
2074.0,2077.0, why aren't consumer friendly emulators created?
2077.0,2079.0," Nobody really, what could happen."
2079.0,2082.0," They actually, actually, a game tab."
2082.0,2083.0, Okay.
2083.0,2084.0, I think that goes that way.
2084.0,2085.0, That's what I'm going to ask you.
2085.0,2087.0," Do you see, do you get Sega Genesis games on one of them?"
2087.0,2089.0," The only thing you don't get in Nintendo games,"
2089.0,2092.0, What about like Saturn and Dreamcast now are the open?
2092.0,2093.0, Yep.
2093.0,2094.0, And they're on PC.
2094.0,2095.0," Yeah, you need to flow there."
2095.0,2096.0, What's it got to go?
2096.0,2097.0, Game is a bit missed to the flow.
2097.0,2100.0," You go to a game tab and just sign up and you, I think it's what,"
2100.0,2101.0, Tom Bucks a month now.
2101.0,2102.0, I think they just dropped their prices.
2102.0,2103.0, Not a bad.
2103.0,2105.0, I think they're on your PC.
2105.0,2108.0," Yeah, so it's like, like, old arcade games, old console games."
2108.0,2110.0," I think they even have like PC games too, so like,"
2110.0,2111.0, be on good and evil.
2111.0,2113.0, No one plays music games.
2113.0,2114.0, Exactly.
2114.0,2115.0, How?
2115.0,2117.0, How do they play?
2117.0,2119.0," You know, how does it like a soul caliber plan on the PC?"
2119.0,2122.0," Well, you can map it out to a joypad or it works on keyboard and mouse."
2122.0,2124.0, It has all the instructions right there.
2124.0,2125.0, It's pretty basic.
2125.0,2127.0," And if I go to a commercial forum right now,"
2127.0,2129.0, but it does actually work.
2129.0,2130.0, Brought to you by Darren Glitz down.
2130.0,2131.0, Yes.
2131.0,2132.0, Hi.
2132.0,2133.0, So that's the answer.
2133.0,2135.0, The answer is you can do it.
2135.0,2137.0," You can't be able to win, pay monthly fee."
2137.0,2138.0, Right.
2138.0,2139.0, Maybe it's worth it.
2139.0,2140.0, Maybe we'll see now.
2140.0,2142.0," I mean, it looks like within Nintendo,"
2142.0,2145.0," we have their calling in a virtual console, which basically means it's got a hard drive."
2145.0,2147.0, You can buy crap on it.
2147.0,2151.0," But, you know, we're seeing them cut deals with some of the main games for the"
2151.0,2153.0, TurboGrafx 16 and some old Sega games.
2153.0,2157.0, Maybe we'll see in the equivalent of that on PC where you pay per game.
2157.0,2160.0," So rather than paying a monthly fee, you just pay 99 cents,"
2161.0,2162.0," I want to know,"
2162.0,2163.0, $19.42 or something.
2163.0,2165.0," So I told you, I do as model basically."
2165.0,2166.0," Just kind of like,"
2166.0,2167.0," Yeah, something like that."
2167.0,2169.0," And the one exception, of course,"
2169.0,2171.0, you wouldn't see anything on there from Nintendo.
2171.0,2172.0, Yeah.
2172.0,2173.0," First of all, you're whatever."
2173.0,2175.0," But yeah, why not?"
2175.0,2176.0," I mean, you see stuff like Capcom,"
2176.0,2178.0, which started release console games.
2178.0,2181.0," It recent PS2 games for budget prices on PC,"
2181.0,2182.0, like the only Moosha games.
2182.0,2185.0, So it's like why not go all the way back in their library
2185.0,2187.0, and just make it their cheap and get it digitally?
2187.0,2188.0, Right.
2188.0,2189.0, Same cast games.
2189.0,2190.0," I mean, the system's dead, right?"
2190.0,2192.0," So why, why have those games?"
2192.0,2195.0," It's either that, either get money or let the guys go to,"
2195.0,2197.0," you know, demonoid or wherever and get them for free, you know?"
2197.0,2198.0, Yeah.
2198.0,2199.0, I don't know.
2199.0,2201.0," I mean, the best of the best of the best of the best."
2201.0,2202.0," And as soon as I could say,"
2202.0,2203.0," as go to Game Tap for now,"
2203.0,2205.0, we're just keeping the wear sights because
2205.0,2206.0, what don't say that on air?
2206.0,2208.0," I mean, don't go to the wear sights."
2208.0,2209.0, Thank you.
2209.0,2211.0, We don't even know what wear is is.
2211.0,2212.0, Where what?
2212.0,2213.0, W.
2213.0,2215.0, Good Lord.
2215.0,2217.0, We need some training at the staff here.
2217.0,2220.0, We have another reader question.
2220.0,2221.0, We do.
2221.0,2222.0, We do.
2222.0,2223.0, Okay.

2226.0,2227.0, Kills with one L.
2227.0,2228.0, Okay.
2228.0,2229.0, Kiles.
2229.0,2230.0, Yeah.
2230.0,2231.0, laughter kills me.
2231.0,2235.0, I have a more professional question for you.
2235.0,2236.0," Oh, good luck."
2236.0,2238.0, Is anybody on your staff a furry?
2238.0,2239.0, Y.
2239.0,2241.0, Why do you bring these in?
2241.0,2242.0, You're setting me.
2242.0,2243.0, You're the one.
2243.0,2244.0, We're not going to kill.
2244.0,2245.0, I'll let you into that.
2245.0,2246.0, Yeah.
2246.0,2248.0, You want it answered since you asked the question.
2248.0,2251.0," Ryan, what does apparently you have something to say?"
2251.0,2252.0," Oh, no."
2252.0,2253.0, Is it not that we are on your cell for us?
2253.0,2254.0," No, no, no."
2254.0,2256.0, I just wanted to write you guys.
2256.0,2258.0," But does it, what does that mean?"
2258.0,2260.0, That means like I dress up like an ass.
2260.0,2261.0, Is that what it is?
2261.0,2262.0, I love to ask.
2262.0,2263.0, Cost new.
2263.0,2264.0, You finally to rot it.
2264.0,2265.0," Well, I'm clearly."
2265.0,2266.0, I'm clearly.
2266.0,2267.0, I know I do with the early start.
2267.0,2268.0," Well, I have my delge."
2268.0,2270.0," Well, I just kind of like roll out."
2270.0,2272.0, People with an FBD for animals.
2272.0,2274.0, Pretty much not wearing it.
2274.0,2275.0, That's what I think.
2275.0,2276.0, I don't think I can do that.
2276.0,2277.0, I don't think I can do that.
2277.0,2278.0, If I do that.
2278.0,2279.0, Okay.
2279.0,2280.0, But I dress up like an animal.
2280.0,2282.0, And then someone else does something nasty to me.
2282.0,2284.0, Because I'm dressed up like that.
2284.0,2285.0, You've been watching.
2285.0,2286.0, You've been watching my CS.
2286.0,2288.0," So, no need to watch my entire thing."
2288.0,2289.0, I think I know what he's talking about.
2289.0,2293.0," You had a good question about how we choose our cover stories in the process,"
2293.0,2295.0, but which we arrive at our features.
2295.0,2297.0, We opted instead to ask you to go the previous.
2297.0,2298.0, Okay.
2298.0,2299.0, Let's wrap it on the website.
2299.0,2301.0, What is that saying about us?
2301.0,2303.0," Next week, we're going to answer that serious question."
2303.0,2304.0, I would have told it.
2304.0,2305.0, I did.
2305.0,2308.0," Next week, we're going to talk about how we pick cover stories."
2308.0,2310.0," But right, I'll focus on Furry's."
2310.0,2311.0, Right.
2311.0,2312.0, Okay.
2312.0,2313.0, We're done.

2319.0,2321.0, We're not yet doing that Guild Wars giveaway.
2321.0,2324.0," We were talking about it, but we don't have the rules down yet."
2324.0,2326.0," Next month, next Monday is Memorial Day."
2326.0,2327.0," Oh, all of all."

2332.0,2333.0, It's a good deal.

2334.0,2335.0, Feel free to sample any of our song.
2335.0,2336.0, That's right.

2338.0,2339.0, Remix it.
2339.0,2340.0, Right.
2340.0,2344.0," But, or not, we're just coming up with some nice tune."
2344.0,2351.0," And if we use your song as the podcast theme, you get what?"
2351.0,2352.0, Our Eternal gratitude.
2352.0,2353.0," It's a good word, man."

2378.0,2379.0, Or the breakdown servers in a lot of salt.
2379.0,2382.0, Please keep Sean and Darren company that are lonely out.
