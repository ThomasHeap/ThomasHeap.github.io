0.0,10.0," Hello, this is Jeff Green, broadcasting live from E3 in Los Angeles, the C.D.W. Radio podcast."
10.0,16.0, With me is the entire gang of idiots of C.D.W. and plus special guest idiot.
16.0,18.0, Vice idiot.
18.0,27.0," We don't all have mics because we're in a crowded cramped room here on the E3 show floor, but we're going to try to spot out to everybody gets their say."
27.0,33.0," But with me on Mike right now are the previous editors, Sean Elliott."
33.0,35.0, Why do you talk?
35.0,36.0, Tell them it's real.
36.0,38.0," Review editor, Ryan Scott."
38.0,41.0," Raspi Bastard, Daring Gladstone."
41.0,48.0," And we're just going to get right to it because we don't have a lot of time and we have a lot to cover, but I'm just going to say from start."
48.0,54.0, Does anybody disagrees me that this is like the best E3 for PC games in like years?
54.0,59.0, And this is not me like blowing like hype smoke up the collective rare.
59.0,62.0, I really think this has just been an awesome show for PC.
62.0,64.0," Yeah, it's been a general live."
64.0,69.0," I mean like you figure with a year where there's two consoles, do you know how for supremacy here past three and we?"
69.0,72.0, And yet the game is it once talking about it all PC?
72.0,74.0, Yeah.
74.0,83.0," It seems like sometimes even when the PC has a good year, it's like, you know, it still almost feels like we're playing, you know."
83.0,93.0," We're kind of like the backup or, you know, the red headed stepchild to what's going on at the show, but it seems like there's a lot of stuff that's PC that's actually center stage."
93.0,101.0," Sport, crisis, Quake Wars games like that are all getting serious attention from seems like the population at large here."
101.0,103.0, Not that anybody's listening.
103.0,104.0, No.
104.0,106.0," No, I totally agree."
106.0,108.0, At an inventory to where you Quake Wars to that.
108.0,109.0," Definitely Quake Wars, right?"
109.0,112.0," So actually, let's, yeah, let's just like talk about it."
112.0,118.0," What if you guys seen that has, has really been awesome for you at the show?"
118.0,119.0, Four.
119.0,120.0, Four.
120.0,121.0, Yeah.
121.0,122.0, Sorry.
122.0,124.0, Let's get the obvious ones out of the way.
124.0,125.0," I mean, sport looks great."
125.0,126.0, Yeah.
126.0,132.0, We should say we just all walk out of the sport demo that will write give about a half hour demo that came.
132.0,134.0, And it looked pretty sweet.
134.0,135.0, Yeah.
135.0,136.0, I can't wait to play him.
136.0,138.0," It keeps, he just kept going."
138.0,139.0, Yeah.
139.0,140.0, He's going to be the plan.
140.0,143.0, Now we're going to show you the soloist and now we're going to show you the universe.
143.0,147.0, Like most games would have been like one or two of those levels would have been enough.
147.0,153.0, And then it's like a kept going back and then there was another level of game and then another and then another.
153.0,163.0," The one thing I am looking forward to seeing more on that in the coming months, the coming year is since we've seen all the macro scale stuff and the movement between, you know, one phase of civilization to the next."
163.0,168.0," I'm wondering about the specific more about the specifics of, you know, within each one of those subsets."
168.0,169.0, Yeah.
169.0,171.0," How much depth there there is, you know, you're right."
171.0,172.0, It's been left pretty vague.
172.0,174.0, Like what are you going to do when you are in a city?
174.0,175.0, What is that going to play like?
175.0,182.0," Well, that's probably the one that's probably the one that deeper parts just build the up at civilization becomes a, you know, a sim game."
182.0,183.0, Uh-huh.
183.0,184.0," Well, kind of game."
184.0,189.0," It looks like a like neighboring plans because like a pack you, so maybe it sounds kind of like an RTS or something."
189.0,190.0, Maybe.
190.0,195.0," And then earlier it was like, it was like Sims like right, like making friends and it's almost like all is pretty."
195.0,200.0, It's like all this previous games are kind of leading up to this kind of like used tackling the different pieces of it before then.
200.0,214.0," And and I guess the other big concern in this is there's all this customizability that we've seen, you know, we've seen not only the creature creation menus, but civilization creation menus from, you know, housing structures vehicles and whatnot."
214.0,217.0, But how cosmetic is it how superficial.
217.0,224.0," Can you design a civilization that works that excels one field and not in another same same way that you would with creature, you know, just in the so-"
224.0,230.0," Yeah, all that range, I don't doubt it, but that's all the stuff that I'm looking forward to seeing more so you're a hater."
230.0,232.0, Not a don't even say it.
232.0,233.0, Don't even say it.
233.0,234.0, Uh-huh.
234.0,237.0," Okay, so enough of far you can read about it in the June CGW, right?"
237.0,238.0, On sale now.
238.0,239.0, Yeah.
239.0,240.0," Um, what else?"
240.0,241.0, What else?
241.0,243.0," Well, if I've got around off on enemy territory,"
243.0,244.0, Yeah.
244.0,247.0," Quick wars just because I, what's been a good three hours playing it?"
247.0,248.0, That is so awesome.
248.0,249.0, I was enjoying it.
249.0,250.0," Hell, that today."
250.0,251.0, Yeah.
251.0,253.0," It's kind of crazy how it's, I mean, that'll feel 2042."
253.0,260.0," I mean, we've kind of, we've, we've, we've looked at the two and, and off the bat said, well, we'll, and we territory looks more interesting."
260.0,267.0," And now that I played about field, it, um, seems like it's a lot more fun than I suspected, but by comparison, um, it's game."
267.0,275.0," As Flash damage is just game, you know, specifically, is, is a lot more, you know, compelling at the moment, you know, sitting down and playing, playing each of those."
275.0,281.0," And, uh, you can just see all the potential for, um, sort of the typical, the emergent play that people are used to in those."
281.0,284.0, So you can put an anti-personnel mind in the front of your Jeep.
284.0,289.0," And instead of the usual, you know, battlefield that's C4 on a Jeep, run it in, go straight and get out and detonate it."
289.0,291.0, But now you can sort of bulldoze through personnel.
291.0,298.0," And if you don't, if they don't get caught in the wheels, the anti-personnel mind's, the claim words are going off on the front of your, your bumper as you're running through them."
298.0,305.0," So I'm already finding all kinds of stuff like that and, you know, I enjoyed writing my, I think Chris on top of, on top of a Titan Titan's dropping bombs around top of them."
305.0,306.0, Right.
306.0,307.0, Yeah.
307.0,308.0, That thing's fun.
308.0,310.0," I mean, it goes back to the Jet Packs and, yeah."
310.0,311.0, And it's expansion for battlefield.
311.0,317.0," And, uh, like the first day and I think I tried as once, night we're, took the Jet back to the roof of, uh, the GDF spawn and start sniping."
317.0,324.0," But it was reassuring to see that they had already anticipated that and they put up automated turrets on, uh, in that very area."
324.0,329.0," So it was good just talking to them about how, uh, because as we see the game, I mean, it looks great right now."
329.0,333.0," They can ship it and it would be great, but the, the real challenge is just bouncing in."
333.0,335.0," You could not really, I mean, a lot of time."
335.0,336.0, Right.
336.0,339.0," And, you know, these are the former team fortress quake guys, so I mean, like they know what they're doing."
339.0,340.0, Set them up.
340.0,354.0," And it was reassuring talking with Kevin Cloud there too, because they know, they know that they not only need to test with testers that are trying to break the game, you know, for bugs, but with testers that are trying to break the experience for other people, you know, specifically griefers and one not griefers like, right."
354.0,360.0," And I offered, I offered to help out if they needed some, but, uh, you guys, other, I mean, geez."
360.0,361.0," I mean, by a shock."
361.0,362.0, Yeah.
362.0,363.0, Yeah.
363.0,364.0, You need to get in there and sit off on it.
364.0,365.0, You need to run over on it.
365.0,366.0," It's, it's awesome."
366.0,367.0, It looks gorgeous.
367.0,376.0," It's, as opposed to most other, um, you know, first person shooters, it's, you know, where there's a tank corridor, is this is like a, if you read the, if the channel is plugged for our main issue, right."
376.0,379.0," If you read the preview there, I mean, it's, so this is the game."
379.0,384.0," This is from a rational who made system shock too, and that this is being called like the spirit of trolls."
384.0,385.0," It's, right."
385.0,386.0," It didn't feel, it felt like system shock."
386.0,387.0, It's not a video.
387.0,389.0," I mean, it's still early on, but I mean, yeah."
389.0,400.0," There's definitely a tension there and a vibe that I can't even really put my finger on it, like as you're playing it, you feel like you're doing this, this, the backstory is like, yeah, this is, you're totally in society, all underwater."
400.0,406.0," And you are walking around and you feel like there's this whole war that happened, or you know, this whole civil war, I guess."
406.0,410.0," And you're just kind of dealing with the piece, the piece are being picked up."
410.0,411.0, You just bring it out of there before the season.
411.0,418.0," Because you get to interact with any of the other creatures and, yeah, yeah, the big brothers and the, and the, the, the, the, the big goons that you see all the screenshots on, they for,"
418.0,433.0," the little, like, like, you take a girl's, so you, so they walk around the world and if you, and like, they'll run away, scare from you behind the big goon, the big brother and they'll just like, they'll start if you're, they'll leave you alone as long as you're, you know, not perceived as a threat."
433.0,434.0, Okay.
434.0,441.0," So that's interesting, because that's the big point that they were making is that you don't have to kill everything that you're not, that your options go beyond that the, the,"
441.0,455.0," the side them up and pull the trigger thing. So I just wanted to see if they're, if they're going to be part of the game world is that you have, you, you, you, you, you gain the ability to like alter your DNA and give yourself certain powers and you go to, it kind of like how insistent,"
455.0,463.0," check it, you go to like, you go to like, you know, you know, the little stations and like drops of money and whatever bonuses are cash for strum,"
463.0,470.0," for a crash or strap, will be, for the stuff, well, you basically like actually, it's a, a good comparison was probably more like Guild Wars,"
470.0,474.0," where you know, you pick your deck of powers you want for you out on a mission, right? Same kind of thing."
474.0,475.0, That's cool.
475.0,483.0," Crisis was the next game that was going to come and there's a good segue because in that game, rather in earning points to allocate to various, you know, you know,"
483.0,490.0," you know, a field, resources and stuff. You have them all together. You have say 100% energy, but on the fly as you play, you can say move attributes."
490.0,497.0," I want to power all my, all the energy into my arms or something. And then at which point then you can lift very heavy objects."
497.0,502.0," You, you, you punch someone in your melee to overcome that much more devastating. You could run it all the speed."
502.0,508.0," If you have, you know, a circumstance where you just want to run really quick, put it into your cloaking device when you want to go stealth."
508.0,514.0," That's that that was pretty interesting. It was similar similar, but instead of having to turn the stuff you're constantly pulling that menu up."
514.0,523.0," Well, I mean, then there's also the village just going back to Baja for one more second. The other piece of tension. I kind of felt, you know, mentioned is that there's like almost no ammunition in the world."
523.0,526.0, So you have to like really scavenge try to figure out where you're going to get your mix like wait up or tight.
526.0,532.0," I remember since I'm shocked being that way, too, wasn't it? Like you really had to fight to reload your weapon."
532.0,540.0," Like you saw me like really a depreserve here. I'm a little bit here, but you're right. It is very cool. You could switch your suit on the fly and like you can change the load out of your weapon."
540.0,542.0, And in the right.
542.0,544.0," Right. Yeah, like so beautiful."
544.0,545.0, It looks awesome.
545.0,552.0, When you pull up your gun instead of the traditional so-called ghost recon interface where you go to a menu and click left and right and look at your options.
552.0,557.0, You just hold your gun up at an angle where you can see the parts and then different menus appear off of that.
557.0,558.0," Yeah, that was really cool."
558.0,559.0," Yeah, that was really cool."
559.0,562.0, Was it my imagination? Was it like this kind of like blur effect going on?
562.0,568.0," I was noticing when I actually when you moved fast, that wasn't as my turn quick, quick mouse look movement would create a motion blur."
568.0,569.0, That was neat.
569.0,572.0," Yeah, I caught that too. I thought it was a really cool, really cool."
572.0,573.0," It was a really cool, really cool."
573.0,574.0, And it was really cool.
574.0,575.0," And it was neat, right?"
575.0,577.0, And it's not all that I definitely should have lighting.
577.0,579.0, I had dynamic range lighting going on.
579.0,580.0, Yeah.
580.0,583.0," So it's, you know, you're getting blurry eye at certain points and yeah."
583.0,586.0, I don't know if that's going to get distracting after a while or not.
586.0,589.0, Not as distracting as blinking and alone in the dark.
589.0,590.0," Oh, yeah."
590.0,591.0, That was weird.
591.0,592.0, Those are weird.
592.0,594.0," In fact, I think I always thought that."
594.0,597.0," You know, actually, actually, if you hit like the space bar, you could pour some byzine and"
597.0,598.0, do it with some of the things.
598.0,601.0," So if there were other people out there listening, well, we're the gameplay features and"
601.0,605.0," alone in the dark is that, I don't know if it's glaucomo vision or web."
605.0,608.0," You're in fire, you're in fire, you're clarity degrades."
608.0,610.0, And then there's a button you press to blink.
610.0,613.0," And then at which point, you know, that there's a bunch of security increases."
613.0,615.0," But then it once again, it goes back down."
615.0,619.0, But it looked like it was just that for one hallucinogenic segment of the game rather than
619.0,623.0," type, we'll imagine playing an entire game where you're, we have to keep, you know,"
623.0,624.0, manually.
624.0,628.0," And then next next they need, you know, you have to press to tear all the coal and the"
628.0,630.0," keep your pulse going or whatever, take a breath."
630.0,635.0," I was thinking even when watching that, there was a mind of you, like, old RPGs where you had to"
635.0,639.0," eat, where you had to do all these, like, manual things that just were not fun, but, you know,"
639.0,642.0," like, oh, I have to stop and eat an apple now or else I'm going to faint."
642.0,643.0, Right?
643.0,645.0," And I was like, now we have to blink, screw you."
645.0,648.0, That game was kind of weird looking at that.
648.0,649.0, Not the bag on it.
649.0,652.0," But then, let me, like, well, actually, I mean, what do you, what do you want on the dark cake?"
652.0,656.0," I mean, I, I, I, I only played the first two games in series, kind of gave up on, you know,"
656.0,657.0, the third and fourth.
657.0,659.0," What do you, I mean, what do you think?"
659.0,663.0," It looked cool to me here's why, like, you know, it reminded me of a graphic adventure, but"
663.0,667.0," with a greater degree of realistic interactivity and not so, I mean, at least what they're"
667.0,671.0," showing, not so much fighting and things, but, you know, hot wiring a car from a first"
671.0,674.0, person perspective and moving around and all sorts of things.
674.0,677.0," I mean, that keeps you entertained even though you're not necessarily shotgunning, you know,"
677.0,678.0, goals and whatnot.
678.0,680.0, And that looked promising to me.
680.0,681.0, Yeah.
681.0,682.0, Yeah.
682.0,683.0, I guess so.
683.0,684.0, I don't know.
684.0,685.0, Maybe the blinking was just too much.
685.0,688.0," I think, I think it's just, it probably only do that, like, beginning, like,"
688.0,689.0, certain little parts.
689.0,690.0, You kind of sell a vibe.
690.0,693.0," I think that's a sort of good general piece of advice for any developer, dumb,"
693.0,694.0," I mean, a game."
694.0,696.0," Don't shop the blinking, like, the first thing."
696.0,697.0, Yeah.
697.0,698.0, The blink simulator.
699.0,702.0," All right, I passed up my microphone a couple other things I saw."
702.0,704.0," Surprise, surprise, rolling conflict."
704.0,708.0," And only that because I've not traditionally CGW's big start, TS guy, but, uh,"
708.0,713.0," cool thing, I played the multiplayer, and I've foreign format, and you basically,"
713.0,717.0," instead of collecting resources, whatnot, the gameplay is divided with one player on"
717.0,721.0," Air Force, one player on infantry, another on armor and tanks, and then one on support,"
721.0,724.0," which would be bridge players and aircraft vehicles, whatnot."
724.0,727.0," And consequently, I had a lot less to focus on, right, and I was able to"
727.0,732.0," use my troops, my Air Force to that most efficiency."
732.0,734.0, But the hell is that?
734.0,736.0," I was almost here here, like, trumpets in the headhead."
736.0,738.0, It's like the cavalry is arrived there.
738.0,739.0, Right.
739.0,740.0, And he's pretty free.
740.0,741.0," So what's going on, Ryan?"
741.0,743.0, What are all these emotions you have going on?
743.0,745.0, Is she sick now?
745.0,747.0," Okay, apparently Jeff's still second."
747.0,749.0, I don't know what's going on.
749.0,750.0, Yeah.
750.0,752.0," And then, uh, listen, folks."
752.0,754.0," Yeah, actually, so, was there any cool games you saw?"
754.0,756.0," Like, like, we're like, you know, the big games that you kind of,"
756.0,758.0," like, surprised you."
758.0,759.0, World and conflict?
759.0,760.0, That was a good game.
760.0,763.0," Well, what's there were games that they're not small ones, but they're once that I went in."
763.0,768.0," They weren't as high on my radar yet, but supreme commander, Chris Taylor looked"
768.0,769.0, awesome.
769.0,772.0," I thought, um, and uh, I got a little bit of what did you think?"
772.0,773.0, Really?
773.0,774.0," Thank God, looked really good."
774.0,777.0, I'm going to go on record and saying that there's a lot of haters for that
777.0,778.0, game around here.
778.0,780.0," I'm not one of them yet, Darren."
780.0,783.0," No, I mean, that game, well, that game's been around for like two years now."
783.0,786.0," And there's been nothing to show except like, you know, nice architecture."
786.0,787.0, Yeah.
787.0,788.0," No, it's like a CAD program."
788.0,790.0, I think we've said that in the acting D-CAD.
790.0,795.0," But this time, I thought it really, I mean, it's a really ambitious MMO."
795.0,798.0," You know, I think they have, it's hardcore, though."
798.0,801.0," No, I don't think it's going to appeal to everybody, but like they're bringing back"
801.0,803.0, corps runs and they're bragging about it.
803.0,804.0," You know, you got to respect that."
804.0,806.0," You know, there's no option to it."
806.0,810.0," If you want to retrieve your character when you die in this game, you got to do the corps."
810.0,811.0, Yeah.
811.0,812.0, Unboiled.
812.0,813.0, Okay.
813.0,814.0, We're going to do it.
814.0,816.0, We're going to hot swap in a second.
816.0,817.0, We're going to hot swap.
817.0,818.0, We're going to hot swap.
818.0,820.0," We're hot swap and out, chocolate."
820.0,824.0, And we're bringing an Eric there when I want you to show me the three answers.
824.0,828.0," And Sean Maloy, our brand new and spanking new managing editor."
828.0,829.0, It's easy to do.
829.0,830.0, Hi.
830.0,831.0, Hi.
831.0,833.0, Nice to have you board Eric you too.
833.0,834.0, Hi.
834.0,835.0, Hi.
835.0,836.0, Hi.
836.0,837.0, I hope.
837.0,838.0, Voices coming across.
838.0,839.0, Yeah.
839.0,840.0, We hear you.
840.0,845.0," So Sean and Eric, what did you guys hear that you like that we haven't talked about."
845.0,847.0, Or chime in on what we talked about that you liked.
847.0,852.4," Well, I just want to say the thing that I was most impressed by is the new to new"
852.4,853.4, come forever.
853.4,855.4, I think that's great game.
855.4,858.4," And I'm going to go ahead, Sean."
858.4,861.0," Well, you know, easily the best thing I saw was sport."
861.0,863.0, But we already talked about that to death.
863.0,865.0, I'm actually looking forward to the collective card game aspect too.
865.0,866.0," Oh, yeah."
866.0,867.0, We did a lot of that.
867.0,868.0," That was, yeah."
868.0,869.0, That was cool.
869.0,873.0," I think I would actually do, which is probably something I shouldn't myth first thing of."
873.0,876.0, Why you got the job.
876.0,881.0," But yeah, go ahead and make the Supreme Commander that was, they did a couple really cool things that"
881.0,883.0, I actually haven't really seen in any other RTS.
883.0,887.0, It's like the ability to use this grow wheel to zoom all the way out and I'm going to just
887.0,888.0, print into your mini map.
888.0,889.0," That was, yeah."
889.0,890.0, Yeah.
890.0,891.0, That's something that like collect civilizations to does.
891.0,892.0, Yeah.
892.0,894.0, Which is kind of different genre but pretty close.
894.0,895.0, It's so useful.
895.0,896.0, I do it all the time.
896.0,897.0, Yeah.
897.0,898.0, That was very cool.
898.0,900.0, It's almost the Atari version because you just get all dots.
900.0,901.0, But yeah.
901.0,902.0, Yeah.
902.0,904.0," You could, you could do all screen it."
904.0,906.0, So you're going to have that was interesting.
906.0,911.0," He was like presenting that as like, you know, I'm unveiling this like great new feature, which it is great."
911.0,913.0, But like how many people have two screen?
913.0,914.0, Yeah.
914.0,918.0," But one thing that was kind of cool though, someone, I mean, is going to take advantage of it."
918.0,919.0, I know I will.
919.0,921.0, Is the being able to coordinate your actions.
921.0,924.0, You could pull off a pinser attack and pinser attack and you could have them
924.0,927.0, hit the same type and you could have them hit the same T.A.
927.0,931.0, So instead of you having to like jump back and forth between the two different like squads.
931.0,932.0, It doesn't okay.
932.0,933.0, It synchronizes it for you.
933.0,937.0, And then let's say you had like a picture in picture window.
937.0,938.0, Uh-huh.
938.0,941.0, The leading of modded open so you can like create several picture in picture windows and the interface.
941.0,945.0, So like imagine like you task one window to like look at one strike force.
945.0,947.0, Another the other and you're kind of like.
947.0,949.0, But I love the units in that game.
949.0,950.0, Those humongous units.
950.0,951.0, Yeah.
951.0,952.0, He's been talking about that for a while.
952.0,956.0, He wanted to have a game where the units were actually of scale.
956.0,960.0," You know, I mean like he gave the example if he never wanted to see like pikemen sinking a"
960.0,961.0, battleship anymore.
961.0,962.0, Yeah.
962.0,963.0, Strategy game.
963.0,964.0, This civilization for a long way.
964.0,966.0, The guy's towering over the city.
966.0,967.0, Right.
967.0,969.0, So that was that was good looking.
969.0,970.0, Yeah.
970.0,973.0," Actually, I was playing also on THQs."
973.0,975.0, With was front line feels.
975.0,976.0, Oh yeah.
976.0,977.0, Front lines feel a war.
977.0,979.0, It was from the desert come back guys.
979.0,980.0, I was actually going to surprise by that one.
980.0,981.0, I was too.
981.0,982.0, Yeah.
982.0,983.0, Yeah.
983.0,985.0, They showed that on Xbox 360 and PC both.
985.0,986.0, That's right.
986.0,989.0, I think it's kind of like goes it's kind of like goes to a kind of advanced war fighter.
989.0,991.0, But more of a focus on the action is opposed to the tactics.
991.0,993.0, And I'm kind of looking forward to that one.
993.0,996.0," I mean, it's obviously a easily a year and a half off."
996.0,997.0, But.
997.0,998.0," Well, it's mostly a stuff."
998.0,999.0, Yeah.
999.0,1000.0, I saw that.
1000.0,1003.0, I don't know if you guys got a chance to go see the code masters.
1003.0,1005.0, But they showed me a couple of games.
1005.0,1009.0, One of which called Mailstrom was a really interesting RTS.
1009.0,1014.0, It's got beautiful graphics and a lot of the game engine is based on a 3D system where
1014.0,1018.0, the ground that you're on is actually raised up quite a bit.
1018.0,1024.0," So you can dig huge holes into the ground with, you know, orbital satellite weapons and"
1024.0,1028.0," film with water, which has poisonous effects and all sorts of cool stuff."
1028.0,1030.0, So the engine in that game was very interesting.
1030.0,1032.0, And I'm looking forward to seeing how they do with that.
1032.0,1034.0," Well, you were there to check out overlord."
1034.0,1035.0, I did.
1035.0,1036.0," As a matter of fact, I was a really funny game."
1036.0,1038.0," If you get a chance to check it out, I'd recommend it."
1038.0,1041.0," And basically, it kind of might be a dungeon keeper in a way."
1041.0,1044.0, You control one evil character and you have a hoard of minions.
1044.0,1046.0, A goblet little goblins.
1046.0,1048.0," You have no go kill people, loot houses."
1048.0,1050.0, And basically just be the bad guy.
1050.0,1051.0, Yeah.
1051.0,1053.0, What I saw was they go to this Hobbit village.
1053.0,1057.0," And he's got this, this, you know, slavery hoard of goblins armed with, you know,"
1057.0,1058.0, pikes.
1058.0,1063.0, And they opened some poor bakers home and Russian and you hear that you hear all this crashing
1063.0,1064.0, and burning.
1064.0,1066.0, And these people come out screaming and then you hack them down with your support.
1066.0,1068.0, Cool idea to put goblins in a game.
1068.0,1069.0, Yeah.
1069.0,1070.0, Yeah.
1070.0,1071.0, Yeah.
1071.0,1072.0, Yeah.
1072.0,1073.0, Yeah.
1073.0,1074.0, Yeah.
1074.0,1075.0, I was kind of a hateful thing to say.
1075.0,1076.0, I'm sorry.
1076.0,1077.0," Hey, the game."
1077.0,1078.0, Faster.
1078.0,1082.0, It goes kind of along one's with Darren was talking about where you have sort of the ability to control multiple things.
1082.0,1090.0, And once the goblins are sort of controlled by a certain set of controls and your own guys control by the keyboard and the mouse.
1090.0,1091.0, It's a need.
1091.0,1095.0, It's a cool system allows you to feel like you're doing a lot of once when you're really doing one thing.
1095.0,1098.0," You know, the new alliance race and the world of work."
1098.0,1099.0, I liked it.
1099.0,1100.0, I liked it.
1100.0,1103.0, I was I was holding out for the Murlux.
1103.0,1104.0, I wanted to be a Murlux.
1104.0,1105.0, I think I'm lobbying.
1105.0,1107.0, They're still in a list of more expensive in the way.
1107.0,1108.0, I believe me.
1108.0,1111.0, One of the one of the penny arcade guys said that he was helping me be working.
1111.0,1114.0," And when he said that like, that's all I could think I was like, oh, my God."
1114.0,1115.0, I hope it's far.
1115.0,1116.0, So often.
1116.0,1117.0, And then.
1117.0,1118.0," And I'm like, oh, yeah."
1118.0,1119.0, Yeah.
1119.0,1121.0," I was expecting to like, blue evil dudes."
1121.0,1123.0, I thought it was cool.
1123.0,1124.0," Did you see the, I'm sorry."
1124.0,1125.0, Go ahead.
1125.0,1126.0, Okay.
1126.0,1127.0, You guys.
1127.0,1128.0," What do you see the, the new expansion for Warhammer and Star War?"
1128.0,1130.0," Oh, I haven't seen that yet."
1130.0,1132.0, They're adding to races.
1132.0,1133.0, They're adding the Necrons.
1133.0,1135.0, This evil undead race.
1135.0,1138.0," And they're adding the tau, which are sort of a classic sci-fi race."
1138.0,1145.0," And very controversial in the Warhammer universe of your fan of the, the tabletop game, the tower sort of hated because they don't fit into that whole."
1145.0,1147.0, Flow medieval.
1147.0,1148.0, Incosition.
1148.0,1150.0," Oh, so the mid air sports must be like a flame."
1150.0,1151.0, Exactly.
1151.0,1152.0, They were on it.
1152.0,1154.0, So I think that means you play the board yet.
1154.0,1155.0, You played the tabletop game.
1155.0,1156.0, I used to record.
1156.0,1157.0, I was popular in high school.
1157.0,1158.0, And I had.
1158.0,1160.0, So I had so many.
1160.0,1162.0, I just remember.
1162.0,1164.0, I just remember.
1164.0,1165.0, Just remember.
1165.0,1166.0, Other games.
1166.0,1167.0, Okay.
1167.0,1168.0, Raise your hands if you saw Mass Effect.
1168.0,1169.0, I got to say tomorrow.
1169.0,1170.0, Yeah.
1170.0,1172.0, We got Luke from one up over the race in the sand.
1172.0,1173.0, You saw it.
1173.0,1174.0, Yeah.
1174.0,1175.0, It's awesome.
1175.0,1176.0, It's awesome.
1176.0,1177.0, It's awesome.
1177.0,1178.0, Yeah.
1178.0,1179.0," And you know, Ray and Greg from Byward just walked by."
1179.0,1181.0, That's a cool thing about being in this little bubble here.
1181.0,1183.0, It was like gaining celebrities walking by as we
1183.0,1184.0, Yemmer here.
1184.0,1185.0, Yeah.
1185.0,1188.0," One of the coolest things, especially for stay three was a standing out."
1188.0,1190.0, So the sport theater and a gave new a walk out.
1190.0,1193.0, And then standing there waiting to get in was a.
1193.0,1194.0, No more inspector.
1194.0,1195.0," So just like, wow."
1195.0,1196.0, That's so weird that like.
1196.0,1199.0, All these people are just kind of meeting in the same.
1199.0,1200.0, Yeah.
1200.0,1201.0, See any of the other games.
1201.0,1202.0, Eris.
1202.0,1203.0, Yeah.
1203.0,1204.0, Ryan's.
1204.0,1206.0, And Adam was where they together.
1206.0,1208.0," Oh, that would have been so."
1208.0,1209.0, That would be so good.
1209.0,1211.0, That's the sex video.
1211.0,1212.0, Absolutely.
1212.0,1215.0," Actually, I think I think the camera would have been blown in different."
1215.0,1218.0, Like Adam was in the batsuit.
1218.0,1219.0, Yeah.
1219.0,1220.0, He's like 75 now or something.
1220.0,1222.0, That's what he's also got.
1222.0,1223.0, Who plays Robin too.
1223.0,1224.0, That would have been.
1224.0,1225.0, Perselle in the Robin.
1225.0,1226.0," Oh, yeah."
1226.0,1227.0, That's good.
1227.0,1228.0," See, that's why you're there."
1228.0,1229.0, I'm safe with it for my fancy tonight.
1229.0,1230.0, I think.
1230.0,1231.0, But I'll figure out.
1231.0,1232.0, I actually just threw up a little bit.
1232.0,1234.0, I got my throat.
1234.0,1235.0, Oh.
1235.0,1236.0, Oh.
1236.0,1238.0," Oh, God."
1239.0,1240.0, I don't know if you guys are dark.
1240.0,1241.0, I'm a side of my magic.
1241.0,1242.0, But I think that's a really good.
1242.0,1244.0, I'm very stoked about Assassin's Creed.
1244.0,1245.0, Anyone.
1245.0,1246.0, Assassin's Creed.
1246.0,1247.0," Oh, no."
1247.0,1248.0, I see it on the board over there.
1248.0,1252.0, It's a game of show nominee from the from us from one up.
1252.0,1253.0, So.
1253.0,1254.0, I sounds like I should see it.
1254.0,1255.0, Yeah.
1255.0,1256.0, It's a good one.
1256.0,1259.0," And for the record, just going back to CGW cover stories."
1259.0,1260.0, Huxley was.
1260.0,1261.0, It's just looking great.
1261.0,1263.0," I'm really, really, really excited about Huxley."
1263.0,1266.0," So basically, every game we put on our cover, we think is great."
1266.0,1267.0, Everything else.
1268.0,1270.0, We're supposed to go on the PC game recovery.
1270.0,1271.0, So kind of sucked.
1271.0,1272.0, Oh.
1272.0,1273.0, Oh.
1273.0,1274.0, Did I have to say that?
1274.0,1275.0, I get it out.
1275.0,1276.0, I just want to put that to that.
1276.0,1277.0, I want to put that to that.
1277.0,1278.0, I want to put that to that.
1278.0,1279.0," Actually, let me set you up."
1279.0,1280.0, I'm going to say for the record.
1280.0,1282.0," The new cover, PC game is command and conquer three."
1282.0,1283.0, And that game looked great.
1283.0,1284.0, Yeah.
1284.0,1285.0, Okay.
1285.0,1286.0, Did you write that?
1286.0,1287.0, We all friends again.
1287.0,1288.0, It looks great.
1288.0,1289.0, It has no interface.
1289.0,1290.0, It's really pretty though.
1290.0,1291.0, Yeah.
1291.0,1292.0, It was cool.
1292.0,1293.0, I thought the story of that game looked really neat.
1293.0,1294.0, Yeah.
1294.0,1295.0, Yeah.
1295.0,1296.0," But as we came out, they were asking me like, what I thought."
1296.0,1299.0," I was thinking about, when you played the first couple games, they just kind of like"
1299.0,1301.0, through you in this world without the history behind it.
1301.0,1302.0, Yeah.
1302.0,1304.0," And now when you're actually, you come back and look at this game."
1304.0,1307.0, And at least maybe just me getting excited because I love the series.
1307.0,1310.0, The trailer kind of puts you right back in the world.
1310.0,1311.0, It was cool.
1311.0,1312.0, It was cool.
1312.0,1313.0, It was cool.
1313.0,1314.0, It was cool.
1314.0,1315.0, It was cool.
1315.0,1316.0, It was cool.
1316.0,1317.0, It was cool.
1317.0,1318.0, It was cool.
1318.0,1319.0, It was cool.
1319.0,1320.0, It was cool.
1320.0,1321.0, It was cool.
1321.0,1322.0, It was cool.
1322.0,1323.0, It was cool.
1323.0,1324.0, It was cool.
1324.0,1325.0, It was cool.
1325.0,1326.0, It was cool.
1326.0,1327.0, It was cool.
1327.0,1333.0," I think I was going to say, I want to second with Jeff said, being a freelancer and writing for a wide variety"
1333.0,1334.0, magazines.
1334.0,1337.0, None of them anywhere near as good as any of his dayless publication.
1337.0,1340.0, I just want to say how embarrassing.
1340.0,1342.0, I do want to say all the series.
1342.0,1344.0, This is a great show for PC games.
1344.0,1345.0, There's a lot of great games.
1345.0,1351.0, I was really surprised that there's some Japanese game houses that normally only do console games.
1351.0,1354.0, Like Namco that are releasing PC content.
1354.0,1357.0, The PC is looking really cool.
1357.0,1362.0, I really love to the Microsoft press conference on the first day.
1362.0,1368.0, They paid a lot of good Peter Mard said a lot of good things about supporting games for windows
1368.0,1371.0, which is what we have to call it now.
1371.0,1374.0, The live stuff was awesome.
1374.0,1379.0, The integration of Xbox Live with Live on the PC is so damn smart.
1379.0,1381.0, That's speaking of Huxley.
1381.0,1384.0, They're going to do their own play with Xbox games.
1384.0,1387.0, They're showing it with ShadowWry.
1387.0,1391.0, It's showing off ShadowWry although I can't go in quick as a huge fan.
1391.0,1394.0," I mean, I used to play the game in that platform."
1394.0,1396.0, The SNES and the Jeff's version.
1396.0,1397.0, That's cool.
1397.0,1399.0, The CFPS game.
1399.0,1400.0, I don't know.
1400.0,1401.0, That's so psyched on it.
