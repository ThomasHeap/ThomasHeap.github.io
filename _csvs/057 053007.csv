344.52,345.52, We need to hurry up.
345.52,346.52, Yeah it's a crazy day.
346.52,347.52, We got people looking in here.
347.52,351.52, Probably any minute the fucking retronauts are going to be down here trying to get in.
351.52,352.52, And those DLTV guys.
352.52,353.52, We have to fight them off.
353.52,354.52, Yeah we're not even going.
354.52,356.52, So Jack what have we got to talk about today?
356.52,358.52," Oh, much you're prompting me."
358.52,360.52, We got a lot to talk about.
360.52,361.52, We have a lot to talk about.
361.52,362.52, We have so much to talk about.
362.52,364.52, We could be here for hours.
364.52,365.52, And we will be.
365.52,367.52, Maybe we'll just hijack the studio.
367.52,368.52, Let's go everybody else.
368.52,370.52, We'll just keep vamping until we actually have a.
370.52,376.52, Among the things we have to talk about are two important big huge
376.52,381.52," Microsoft releases this week, which we bring up because we are the official games"
381.52,382.52, that those magazine.
382.52,386.52, And we're here to do our best to promote Microsoft product whenever we can.
386.52,391.52, So we're more excited than ever to announce that finally Halo 2 is coming out on the PC.
391.52,392.52, Yay.
392.52,393.52, Woo.
393.52,394.52, Oh wait.
394.52,395.52, Holy crap.
395.52,397.52, Oh crap.
397.52,398.52, That was kind of better.
398.52,399.52, I can't talk.
399.52,400.52, I've been playing.
400.52,404.52, This is not my now playing but I've been playing nothing but Halo 3 beta
404.52,407.52, while I've been waiting for this PC to arrive.
407.52,410.52, I've been talking about six months now.
410.52,411.52, Yeah.
411.52,412.52," Well, the mystery PC."
412.52,415.52, There's one thing we're saying on that to end all Halo 3 talk.
415.52,417.52," Yeah, I'll that river in the past."
417.52,422.52, I talked about how people found the river in one of the maps while hauling just to be just phenomenal and gorgeous.
422.52,423.52, Yeah.
423.52,426.52, I figured out it's a conveyor belt with KY jelly.
426.52,427.52, You.
427.52,430.52, I have to figure that one out.
430.52,431.52, Look at it.
431.52,432.52, So it looks like too.
432.52,435.52, So my original analogy the game is pretty much holds up.
435.52,437.52, Now the game is clean for that.
437.52,438.52, This is all gel and out.
439.52,441.52, That'll make a good review quote.
441.52,443.52, I can bear about with KY jelly.
443.52,446.52, What is with these people who keep walking by and looking in here?
446.52,447.52, Go away.
447.52,448.52, We're podcasting.
448.52,449.52, We hate you.
449.52,451.52, Love Jeff.
451.52,453.52, Also shadow run.
453.52,454.52, About to come out any minute now.
454.52,457.52, Maybe we're actually a little more excited about that.
457.52,460.52," Yeah, I was being very cynical and so I casted about."
460.52,461.52," Halo, but shadow run."
461.52,462.52, Yeah.
462.52,463.52, I'm into.
463.52,465.52," If you times I have played it, I've had fun."
465.52,467.52," I mean, it's just a straight up multiplayer experience."
467.52,470.52," There's not, but there isn't anything else to it besides that."
470.52,471.52, At least it's a new game.
471.52,472.52, But that's yes.
472.52,473.52, I don't know.
473.52,474.52," I mean, like, I feel like that's it."
474.52,475.52," Like, I don't know."
475.52,477.52, I just want people to say that.
477.52,478.52, And I've said it over and over again.
478.52,480.52, Is that a straight up multiplayer experience.
480.52,481.52, It's no knock against any game.
481.52,482.52, Right.
482.52,484.52," To me, like, you know, here it comes again."
484.52,486.52, You hear me talk about it every week and you have for years.
486.52,487.52, Ball field too.
487.52,488.52, That's exactly.
488.52,490.52," I wouldn't even, you know, they put bots in it later on."
490.52,491.52, Who cares?
491.52,492.52, I didn't want to play that on a play multiplayer.
492.52,494.52," And that's like, I don't know."
494.52,495.52," I mean, that doesn't really say anything to me about it."
495.52,499.52," It's like the lack of total enthusiasm for the game is not well, for some people, I think,"
499.52,503.52, some ponder it's it's that there is no single player from the exact quality of the
503.52,504.52, multiplayer.
504.52,505.52, Right.
505.52,506.52, Right.
506.52,507.52, Right.
507.52,508.52, Right.
508.52,509.52, Right.
509.52,510.52, Right.
510.52,511.52, I wouldn't be excited about this.
511.52,513.52, If this was just straight up PC multiplayer shooter.
513.52,514.52, It's the cross platform stuff to me.
514.52,515.52, That's the industry.
515.52,516.52, Yeah.
516.52,519.52," But what, but there's really this is why we've been to the reason the reason you"
519.52,522.52," One is because there's something about the game itself, the multiplayer itself."
522.52,524.52, That's not that exciting to you for whatever reason that is.
524.52,526.52, I have to admit on the 360.
526.52,527.52, What it comes in.
527.52,529.52, If they if a big huge.
529.52,530.52, Yeah.
530.52,534.52," If a big huge box of shadow run shows up tomorrow, which by the way, it really should"
534.52,536.52, High Microsoft send us your games.
536.52,537.52, Hello Jeff.
537.52,538.52, Yeah.
538.52,539.52, I'm just going out there reading.
539.52,540.52, Wow.
540.52,541.52, This from the coming back.
541.52,542.52, His game is in stores tomorrow.
542.52,543.52, Yeah.
543.52,544.52, Yeah.
544.52,545.52, We don't get any special treatment.
545.52,546.52, We're still waiting.
546.52,547.52, Like early.
547.52,551.52, But if I get to if a box comes from me and there's a VISTA and a 360 version
551.52,552.52, in the middle.
552.52,553.52, Yeah.
553.52,556.52," Well, technically, kind of have to do you either have VISTA set up on a computer?"
556.52,557.52," No, I do not."
557.52,558.52," You say, way."
558.52,559.52," No, do I want to?"
559.52,560.52, Yeah.
560.52,563.52, So I'm the only person I ever made the only person on step that I actually has
563.52,564.52, VISTA.
564.52,567.52, That's because I'm getting new machine sent to me with VISTA on it at this point.
567.52,570.52," Hey, but don't let that influence your decision if you're listening out there."
570.52,572.52, Whether you should upgrade the VISTA or not.
572.52,575.52, That's because no one at the official magazine except for the tech guy actually has
575.52,577.52, Mr.
577.52,579.52, Don't don't do what we do.
579.52,580.52, Do what we say you should do.
580.52,582.52, Maybe we just hope you should upgrade the VISTA.
582.52,583.52, It can be a VISTA.
583.52,584.52, It can be a VISTA.
584.52,585.52, Maybe it will.
585.52,587.52, Maybe this will be a VISTA on the PC.
587.52,588.52, Maybe.
588.52,592.52," I know when I get a new PC, it will have VISTA on it and I will be happy."
592.52,593.52, I think.
593.52,596.52," I just don't want to upgrade my current machine because I don't want to break,"
596.52,600.52, which I said before and I got shit from tech guys on there.
600.52,602.52, I can't believe he said that.
602.52,604.52," Running a magazine, he doesn't even know how to."
604.52,607.52," You know, but that's just the way it is."
608.52,612.52, I don't have faith that things will go right.
612.52,614.52," Well, why would you install it?"
614.52,617.52," Or, Shadowrun and he was exactly."
617.52,618.52," Well, his idea good reason."
618.52,619.52, That's exactly.
619.52,621.52, So in crisis comes around then it's that.
621.52,622.52, Is it good reason?
622.52,623.52, Yeah.
623.52,624.52, Yeah.
624.52,626.52," Well, in the meantime, I guess also, I mean, like,"
626.52,630.52," you know, history kind of proves it like you kind of have to wait a couple months with the with the new OS."
630.52,635.52," I mean, you know, yeah, 98, 95, 98, XP."
635.52,637.52, I don't think I could tell service pack one.
637.52,638.52, Exactly.
638.52,639.52, And I was super happy with it.
639.52,640.52, What was it?
640.52,641.52," Dead, but I waited."
641.52,642.52, I'm still running 95.
642.52,650.52, I think that the real heart of the matters that people aren't finding the the game itself that compelling me.
650.52,651.52, Yeah.
651.52,659.52, We all played the original game as we know the franchise and stuff and we've had plenty of time to get used to the fact to get used to it and the function and leave with the fact that it's a multiplayer game.
659.52,660.52, Yeah.
660.52,661.52, But imagine if it was called whatever.
661.52,663.52, Imagine if it wasn't Shadowrun was called whatever.
663.52,664.52, That's playing this game.
664.52,666.52, It's just not so far my experience.
666.52,668.52, It's not like exciting enough.
668.52,669.52, It's not rewarding.
669.52,671.52, And what if it was called an engine gold?
671.52,672.52, Would you play it then?
672.52,673.52, I probably would.
673.52,674.52, I'd smoke it.
674.52,675.52, I don't know if I'd play it.
675.52,676.52, Seriously.
676.52,681.52, That's what we talk about an engine gold.
681.52,682.52, You brought it up.
682.52,683.52, I brought it up.
683.52,685.52, We're kind of an awkward segue.
685.52,692.52, An engine gold apparently is the name we think or the working name of the new Warren Spectre game.
693.52,699.52, That careful with the with putting the V on there though because we're not sure junction point studios which he formed some time ago.
699.52,704.52, My guess is that they're working they're working on and have been working on something else for some time.
704.52,705.52, Right.
705.52,706.52, I would be surprised if this is it.
706.52,707.52, Me too.
707.52,708.52, Not against it.
708.52,715.52, But it just seems because when you think the thing with Ninja Gold is it's based on a film that's being made by John who.
715.52,720.52, And when you think license games and film games and stuff you don't think Warren Spectre.
720.52,721.52, Yeah.
721.52,727.52, Like you think it's like this really like independent and you know I think it's fair to call him a visionary you know with what he's done.
727.52,729.52, And you just don't think.
729.52,734.52, It's kind of like the other guy that's now who's the guy that's working on an area 51 black site.
734.52,739.52, Oh Harvey Smith Harvey Smith that worked with him on you know some of the day of sex stuff is like it was like huh.
739.52,748.52, And you're wondering well maybe he's going to take and you know with everyone else it's working on it but just in fuse like a game with some cool ideas that you wouldn't expect from it.
748.52,753.52, The same thing that happened with Riddick that was one of the few cases where something went that happened right where to go into it.
753.52,757.52, Yeah like Riddick was better than the movie right in a way better.
757.52,758.52, But yeah it'll be interesting.
758.52,765.52, I was hoping to get some feedback from Warren and time for this taping but didn't happen but we can either put it on the forums or talk about next week.
765.52,773.52, But I asked him a few questions about you know his well for one to clarify is this the game that they've been working on a secret for for some time now.
773.52,787.52, And you know what other one of the things he cited it makes it in an interesting and worthwhile project him as the whole notion of the fusion of classical and contemporary culture sometimes and stuff because this basically a modern day ninja.
787.52,791.52, Which sounds like a funny way to justify my age of 2000.
791.52,794.52, I think you've got a good old.
794.52,799.52, Yeah that's like a little bit of a way to see what it's done with the deal is with this.
799.52,802.52, Yeah ask him how much an ounce costs.
803.52,807.52, Yeah this kind of like what do you say goes to go stock when it's written like that.
807.52,811.52, Yeah this would be a game for a little bit more expected to try it.
811.52,815.52, Like Michael Duda cough American minture production or some kind of stuff like that.
815.52,819.52, Wu Tang's a risous already announced he's doing the production for the soundtrack.
819.52,821.52, Yeah kid I'm kidding.
821.52,823.52, He did a lot of stuff and goes on.
823.52,825.52, He did go stocks yeah great movie.
825.52,826.52, Yeah.
826.52,828.52, We were doing a movie podcast that would be relevant.
828.52,831.52, Yeah so we had to go stock talk.
833.52,837.52, So ninja gold actual game or elaborate practical joke.
837.52,840.52, We'll find out where high quality weed.
840.52,842.52, We'll find out for next.
842.52,843.52, For the next year.
843.52,844.52, Radio doesn't have or no.
844.52,847.52, That's like that's the only is this the first game.
847.52,849.52, This is the dumbest joke ever I've set up.
849.52,853.52, First cover story of this game is going to appear on high times before it appears on
853.52,854.52, Game of War.
854.52,856.52, That's a little lamp.
856.52,857.52, What?
857.52,859.52, Well we'll edit that out.
859.52,860.52, Just stand by that joke.
861.52,863.52, You have to mark my words in years.
863.52,864.52, You will be laughing.
864.52,865.52, It was the joke.
865.52,867.52, Oh someone you like it is.
867.52,869.52, So we set it up as a joke.
869.52,870.52, Should have said that.
870.52,874.52, So I'm going to segue now into what you plan.
874.52,877.52, As we've talked about things we want to play like an engine gold.
877.52,879.52, I'll tell you what I have been playing.
879.52,882.52, I reinstalled for some wacky reason.
882.52,885.52, I reinstalled a rise of legends.
885.52,887.52, It actually wasn't a wacky reason.
887.52,889.52, It was because it was a starcraft.
889.52,894.52," It was a starcraft reason because on the originates podcast, which was about"
894.52,901.52, Starcraft garnered brought up rise of legends as an example of a modern RTS that had
901.52,905.52, the three different sides that were totally different from one another and still
905.52,908.52, maintained balance like Starcraft.
908.52,913.52, And I didn't actually give rise of legends a lot of time when it came out earlier.
913.52,916.52, I think just because it must have come out at a flood of other releases.
916.52,918.52, I think that's right when age of empires three came out.
918.52,925.52, But I just kind of pass it by even though I loved rise of nations and I have to say it is quite a great game.
925.52,926.52, Hello.
926.52,927.52, I agree with you.
927.52,929.52, You think it's better than right in Asians?
929.52,933.52," I think I do, but that's actually because I, I wouldn't say it's better."
933.52,941.52, I would say I prefer it because I tend to be more of a fantasy dark than a real life dark.
941.52,945.52," So which is why I prefer like heroes of might magic over, say,"
945.52,950.52," even though I totally bluff seven respects, but I tend to hear on the fantasy side of things."
950.52,952.52, But we did give this a good review.
952.52,953.52, Didn't we?
953.52,954.52," Yeah, you give it like a."
954.52,958.52," Okay, because otherwise I just back back and re-react in the non-review and show them like that."
958.52,960.52," Yeah, we give an editor's choice back in the day."
960.52,961.52, Yeah.
961.52,963.52, It's a great game.
963.52,964.52, It is a great game.
964.52,966.52, What's making it send out to you?
966.52,967.52," Well, there's that issue."
967.52,972.52," There's the issue of the balance of three different, very distinct races, which is hard to do."
972.52,974.52, All with their own play styles.
974.52,979.52," Also, the new sources and tech tree type stuff and the tech trees are completely different."
979.52,982.52," I mean, maybe not quite as there's nothing as radicals."
982.52,983.52, It's a zero.
983.52,987.52," No, this irg stand out is like the big differentiating point between like starcraft and air two,"
987.52,988.52, then right?
988.52,989.52," Yeah, led to me."
989.52,990.52, Mm-hmm.
990.52,993.52," Also, you know, this game is just reminding me like really how far."
993.52,997.52," I mean, playing, I played Starcraft for a long time right after the,"
997.52,999.52, Starcraft two and as we came out.
1000.52,1008.52," The going from that to this and jumping 10 years, you really could see how far the RTS is of come,"
1008.52,1013.52," which was more speaking to your point, Sean, a while ago, where you were saying that you felt like Starcraft."
1013.52,1016.52," Now, it was like kind of too limiting to you."
1016.52,1018.52, I was just doing that based on speculation.
1018.52,1021.52, A lot of it's from what I hear like talking to people that are.
1021.52,1022.52, But you're kind of riding playing on it.
1022.52,1028.52," And it was just, yeah, just to reiterate it was that you have a very rigid rock paper scissors."
1028.52,1034.52," And although that term is used all the time, whatever balance is being addressed and anything from a battlefield to an RTS."
1034.52,1039.52," In this case, they really mean it and that if they're, if you do something with your tech tree,"
1039.52,1043.52," that's the equivalent of scissors, someone's going to come out with a rock and it's definitely going to beat you."
1043.52,1045.52," And then you're going to lose because of that, right?"
1045.52,1053.52," Where's like in prior to recent patches, company heroes, especially a good example of a game that would,"
1053.52,1059.52," that would make that not be the case. You know, you essentially have the option to go and retain here with whatever you're doing."
1059.52,1065.52, And your tactics are always going to be more important than like if you made some strategic snafu in the beginning of the game.
1065.52,1068.52," And you're just going to pay for it, you know."
1068.52,1069.52," Yeah, I think right."
1069.52,1073.52," Although that does exist in company heroes too, based on like the territory that you decide to get."
1073.52,1077.52, You could definitely lose a multiplayer game because you didn't in the first minute of the game.
1077.52,1081.52," You didn't get secure, especially important building or something."
1082.52,1084.52, Right. So it start craft to me is like speed chess.
1084.52,1089.52," You know, it's just there's a very certain way you almost have to play it."
1089.52,1090.52, You trace.
1090.52,1092.52, Right. And every move is countered by another.
1092.52,1093.52, I'm just reiterating.
1093.52,1094.52, Yeah. So exactly.
1094.52,1096.52," And that's exactly what I've, what I've been told about it."
1096.52,1097.52, Yeah.
1097.52,1098.52, And it's awesome.
1098.52,1100.52," I mean, it's perfect for what that is."
1100.52,1108.52," But but rise of legends to me, it's, it's got the, the fast pace of RTS, but there's so many elements in there that are,"
1108.52,1116.52," are drawn from turn-based games and drawn from board games even that add like all this, just extra tactical thinking to it that I, that I really love."
1116.52,1121.52, You talking about the like the campaign and the world map thing or you talking even even in the game.
1121.52,1126.52," Even within the campaign, even in the campaign or the skirmish maps either way."
1126.52,1133.52," There's like a lot of decisions you have to make with how you're going to level up the, the points you get."
1133.52,1136.52, What are those called.
1136.52,1141.52," Where you can, you know, expand the flaming."
1141.52,1142.52, Right.
1142.52,1144.52, So I'd drip and down my face.
1144.52,1145.52, And we're just going to throw you the aim.
1145.52,1149.52," Yeah, you know, to to limit the attention of your units and those are talking about orders."
1149.52,1153.52, I just can't remember the term for great way to point their points.
1153.52,1154.52, The points.
1154.52,1157.52," Something that there's something with something that's like, yeah."
1157.52,1162.52," But in the campaign too, you know, the way that the campaign, I mean, there's plenty of other games to do this, the wrong time."
1162.52,1168.52," To do this, the wrong total war series where where you're getting the, the board to decide what, what the next zone is you're going to attack."
1168.52,1169.52, Right.
1169.52,1171.52, And the ramifications of which way you decide to go.
1171.52,1173.52, So it is like the total work games.
1173.52,1174.52, It is kind of like a.
1174.52,1175.52, Yeah.
1175.52,1177.52," And I mean, I just really loved stuff."
1177.52,1181.52," When I played the medieval to the war, I really liked the turn based element of it."
1181.52,1184.52," And it was the real time aspect of it that I found, you know, you know."
1184.52,1186.52," Yeah, that was a save."
1186.52,1191.52," And for me, I feel like both sides hold up really because I don't think the, I didn't think the turn based side of."
1192.52,1193.52, Right.
1193.52,1194.52, Legend is anything special.
1194.52,1195.52," Well, it's not deep."
1195.52,1197.52," No, it's just like you pick left or right."
1197.52,1199.52, And then you either get more.
1199.52,1200.52, Jemms or you get more gold.
1200.52,1204.52, And then you can always go left instead of right the next turn left to rights and tough decision.
1204.52,1205.52, 50 50.
1205.52,1207.52," No, I mean, we don't want to pursue."
1207.52,1208.52, We don't want to pursue.
1208.52,1209.52, We don't want to try to decide.
1209.52,1211.52, I still want to confuse people and let make them believe that this is anything.
1211.52,1212.52, That's true.
1212.52,1214.52," But maybe if yours dumb as me, I was."
1214.52,1217.52," I wonder if it there's like my wife left or right, honey."
1217.8799999999999,1221.52," F sweetest game that came out, like a year II, go called Rathony leashed."
1221.52,1224.52," And it was basically like a fighting game, but you would, oh,"
1224.52,1227.92," The hex pack, there was a hex碼 in between, like, rounds off"
1227.92,1230.24," when you would fight, every beard that joke."
1230.8799999999999,1232.2," That was supposed to be our con, right?"
1232.6,1235.54," Well, it was inspired by our Thomas Terrathonia last year."
1236.54,1238.06, Is there really bad board game
1238.46,1239.46," and a really bad fighting game, all in one."
1240.52,1242.48, Do greater taste that takes everything together.
1242.76,1243.56, So.
1243.56,1244.8, So that's what I've been playing.
1244.8,1248.2," Oh, and actually the other reason I was inspired to do that is if you if"
1248.2,1252.8, false listening don't know is that this was done by big huge games who currently
1252.8,1257.08, are doing extremely well on Xbox Live arcade with the Katan port.
1257.52,1260.48, So so that's why I've been playing that a lot.
1261.08,1265.32, I have been and I'm still getting my ass kicked by that goddamn cheating AI.
1265.96,1268.52," Well, it's all with the other ones that it's a great game."
1268.8,1270.12," Yeah, I think my record against."
1270.12,1272.12," I mean, you establish like two and nine."
1272.12,1273.8799999999999, You've already established that it's not cheating.
1273.8799999999999,1274.8799999999999," Right, though."
1274.8799999999999,1277.6, You actually looked at the code base that why didn't look at the code.
1277.6,1278.6, He posted it.
1278.6,1279.6, But I can't fucking read.
1279.6,1280.6," Oh, yeah."
1280.6,1281.6, That's not any proof.
1281.6,1282.6, I saw him.
1282.6,1283.6, I didn't care.
1283.6,1285.9199999999998," It's like a poster Chinese and went, see."
1286.9199999999998,1291.8," Like, okay, there's it says if then, then something and there's a Boolean variable."
1292.0,1294.1599999999999," Okay, must be honest."
1296.0,1298.04, Probably know that translated into fuck you.
1298.04,1298.8, I'm cheating.
1298.8,1299.8, Right.
1301.08,1302.08, Love.
1302.08,1303.08, Yeah.
1303.08,1307.9199999999998," So anyway, big, big props to big huge games on rides and led."
1307.9199999999998,1309.08, Relatedly for me.
1310.08,1310.6, All stuff.
1310.6,1311.76, Also lots of gears of work.
1311.76,1313.76," Would tell you what I'm talking about, but I played that a lot."
1314.4799999999998,1315.1599999999999, Back to that.
1315.1599999999999,1316.1599999999999, Could you repeat it?
1316.1599999999999,1317.1599999999999, Be thai.
1317.1599999999999,1318.1599999999999," No, I never had."
1318.1599999999999,1320.9599999999998, So I'm still part way through the single player campaign.
1321.9599999999998,1326.7199999999998," At the time I was doing Sean before the show that when a first came out,"
1326.96,1330.3600000000001," I, it's one of those things where I mean, it"
1330.3600000000001,1334.76," think it happens to all of us with every medium, whether it's a movie or game or whatever."
1334.96,1339.3600000000001," If there's too much hype and you didn't buy into it right away, then when you finally"
1339.3600000000001,1342.16," do it, you're like, yeah, I don't see what the deal was there."
1342.4,1343.88, And that happened to me with gears of war.
1343.88,1348.72," I mean, it was to give it the 10, which was the equivalent of the Oprah reading club"
1348.72,1349.76, sticker on a book.
1349.76,1350.76, Yeah.
1350.76,1351.04, Yeah.
1351.04,1351.76, Yeah.
1351.76,1352.4," I mean, so I got a gosh."
1352.4,1353.56, I guess I have to get gears of work.
1353.56,1355.04, Because everybody says this is the shit.
1355.76,1358.68," And I got it and I played a little bit and I was like, huh, really?"
1359.28,1361.92," But it's the same time it made you not want to pick it up to, though, for whatever"
1361.92,1363.28," snow is your reason, you know, right?"
1363.28,1363.68, Yeah.
1363.68,1364.44, That's why I don't watch here.
1364.44,1369.6399999999999," But now with the hype long past or whatever, and I booted it up this week and actually"
1369.6399999999999,1370.6399999999999, thought it was pretty great.
1371.36,1374.24," And even the graphics, which at the time, I was like, I'll see what the big deal is"
1374.24,1376.68, here struck me as big pretty damn cool.
1376.68,1377.8," Yeah, I could do better."
1377.8,1378.48, Yeah.
1378.48,1381.96, So I think a lot of it is early just to like the attitude we bring into it.
1381.96,1382.32, Yeah.
1382.32,1382.68, Totally.
1383.32,1383.8, Totally.
1385.44,1385.6, Yeah.
1385.6,1386.28, That's me.
1386.6,1392.8799999999999, I've been monopolizing the mics on handing it over to Ryan.
1394.6,1395.6399999999999, What do you plan anything?
1395.6399999999999,1400.6399999999999, I spent the entire four day weekend that we just had playing city of
1400.6399999999999,1401.04, villains.
1401.48,1402.32, Was it a was father?
1402.32,1402.96, Really?
1403.36,1403.92, I don't know.
1404.76,1406.1599999999999, What's outside?
1407.12,1408.84, Outside in Paragon City.
1409.36,1409.6, Yeah.
1409.6,1412.04, I just did the math on that.
1412.04,1413.24, And I'm not liking this illusion.
1414.2,1416.64, So you've been watching a whole lot of heroes and all of a sudden you
1417.6,1420.44," inexplicably start playing city of villains again, like how are the"
1420.44,1421.04, two units?
1421.44,1423.32," We like, oh, I got to go reenacty scenes."
1423.76,1425.84," Yeah, that's exactly what you've done."
1426.44,1427.32, That's totally right.
1427.32,1430.52," So Ryan, who's your what's your character in city of villain?"
1430.52,1431.1200000000001, What do you have?
1431.32,1432.24, What's your guy's name?
1432.52,1433.88, His name is Doc Clockwork.
1434.44,1434.76, Okay.
1434.76,1438.6," And he is a mastermind, which is the the tech class."
1438.8,1441.24, Is it permissible for us to refer to him as doc clock?
1442.44,1442.96, Sure.
1443.24,1444.24, All right.
1444.24,1447.24, Does he have a big clock sort of like flavor flavor flavor flavor?
1447.44,1448.24," No, nothing."
1448.24,1449.24," No, no."
1449.24,1452.24," He's an army of mechanical, uh,"
1452.24,1454.24," uh, henchmen, his army of robots."
1454.44,1455.24, That's cool.
1456.24,1457.24, Lots of fun.
1458.04,1460.64, So why would I see that you still the answer why was it?
1460.64,1461.64, Why?
1461.84,1463.24, Why why why why why are you playing this?
1463.24,1464.04, It's fun.
1464.24,1465.04, Why are you playing?
1465.04,1465.44, Wow.
1465.44,1466.04, It's fun.
1466.04,1468.24," Well, well, but in the first half, there you go."
1468.24,1469.24, I never stopped though.
1469.24,1470.24, There you have it.
1470.24,1471.24, What are you even experts?
1471.24,1472.24," Well, you know what?"
1472.24,1474.24, I had never played City of Billons.
1474.24,1475.24, Uh-huh.
1475.24,1476.24, Like City here.
1476.24,1479.24," I mean, there are a lot of it's obviously kind of the same."
1480.24,1483.24, But all the the mission structure and all that stuff in City of
1483.24,1485.24, Ellon is a lot more kind of focused.
1485.24,1486.24, Mm-hmm.
1486.24,1487.24, You know what's not?
1487.24,1488.24, Do you feel like a villain?
1488.24,1490.24, Are you doing villainous quests?
1490.24,1493.24, Or is it just like the guy stuff in a different skin?
1493.24,1494.24, He's killing the good rats.
1494.24,1495.24, He's killing the good rats.
1495.24,1496.24, He's killing the good rats.
1496.24,1498.24, He's killing the good rats.
1498.24,1499.24, He's killing the good rats.
1499.24,1500.24, He's killing the good rats.
1500.24,1501.24, He's killing the good rats.
1501.24,1503.24, You had to like rob banks and...
1503.24,1508.24, So you're stealing all of the verses that are being stolen on the streets and saving the people?
1508.24,1509.24, Pretty much.
1509.24,1510.24, That was my big problem with it.
1510.24,1512.24," There's so many freaking heroes, quote, I'm quote running around."
1512.24,1514.24, And everyone's persons getting stolen everywhere you look.
1514.24,1515.24, Yeah.
1515.24,1516.24, Yeah.
1516.24,1517.24, I'm just a little...
1517.24,1519.24, I don't feel real like it.
1519.24,1521.24, I don't feel real special.
1521.24,1522.24, Yeah.
1522.24,1526.24, It seems like a lot less people play City of Billons.
1526.24,1530.24, There seems to be kind of like a lower population on the villain side.
1530.24,1531.24, Like anyone.
1531.24,1532.24," You're not alone in there, are you?"
1532.24,1533.24," Oh no, no, no."
1533.24,1534.24," No, no, no."
1534.24,1535.24, You guys are all in your clockwork.
1535.24,1536.24, Hello.
1536.24,1537.24, Anyone does anyone need help?
1537.24,1539.24," I mean, maybe it's the same as like, wow, right?"
1539.24,1541.24," I mean, like, a lion's outnumbered for..."
1541.24,1542.24," Yeah, I guess."
1542.24,1543.24, So I'll definitely...
1543.24,1546.24, Plus the thing came out after the heroes.
1546.24,1547.24, Yeah.
1547.24,1548.24," Yeah, good heroes."
1548.24,1549.24, So after.
1549.24,1550.24, So.
1550.24,1554.24," You would like any superhero guild, like, gave your super friends or anything."
1554.24,1556.24," Yeah, your own religion of villains."
1556.24,1558.24, I'm asking if it's...
1558.24,1559.24," Yeah, it's a champion."
1559.24,1560.24," Yeah, sure."
1560.24,1561.24, I'm not kidding.
1561.24,1563.24," I am in a guild, yeah."
1563.24,1564.24, Why do you...
1564.24,1565.24," What's your guild, Culp?"
1565.24,1566.24, Can we say it?
1566.24,1567.24, It's called the Kindred.
1567.24,1569.24, It is a guild that I have been in since the end of the game.
1569.24,1570.24, That's an ultimate online.
1570.24,1571.24, Wow.
1571.24,1572.24, That's impressive.
1572.24,1574.24, So you guys migrate from game to game.
1574.24,1575.24, Pretty much.
1575.24,1576.24, There aren't a lot of us left.
1576.24,1578.24, This is Mark Velar still in your guild.
1578.24,1580.24, I'm gonna pretend.
1580.24,1581.24," Oh, yes."
1581.24,1583.24," Let's play with me, man."
1583.24,1586.24, Think I kicked out of the guild a long time ago.
1587.24,1588.24, So there's not many people left.
1588.24,1590.24, As I guess you're stuck on city of villains.
1590.24,1593.24," But they all say, let's go play something else."
1593.24,1594.24, Did?
1594.24,1599.24," Well, after Ultima Online, nobody, you know, people just moved on to different games."
1599.24,1600.24," So, uh, uh."
1600.24,1602.24," After Ultima Online, that was like 10 years ago."
1602.24,1603.24, What?
1603.24,1604.24," No, that was..."
1604.24,1606.24, That was more recent than that.
1606.24,1608.24, We stopped playing Ultima Online around two thousand.
1608.24,1610.24, Because you stopped playing at a launch date.
1610.24,1611.24," I mean, he did."
1611.24,1612.24," Oh, hell."
1612.24,1614.24, Ultima Online's awesome.
1614.24,1615.24, What?
1615.24,1617.24, Has to need diabolical schemes?
1617.24,1618.24," Uh, I don't."
1618.24,1620.24, Kill the bunch of people with some robots.
1620.24,1621.24, That's pretty diabolical.
1621.24,1622.24, That's pretty diabolical.
1622.24,1623.24, That's pretty diabolical.
1623.24,1626.24, You actually get to move up to where you can be.
1626.24,1628.24," Like, yeah, like that, like a crime king pin."
1628.24,1630.24," But, you know, like a dock, aquavel sort of guy."
1630.24,1632.24," I think eventually it gets to the point where like,"
1632.24,1634.24," there are all these kind of signatures,"
1634.24,1636.24, super villain in PCs in the game.
1636.24,1637.24, Uh-huh.
1637.24,1639.24," And you reach a point when you get to the higher levels where you can,"
1639.24,1642.24, I guess fight those guys and...
1642.24,1643.24, Can you win?
1643.24,1644.24, Yeah.
1644.24,1646.24," You know, I'm a those work."
1646.24,1649.24," I mean, you win."
1649.24,1652.24," And then, you know, the next group comes in kills and wins."
1652.24,1653.24, Yeah.
1653.24,1655.24, But looking for the animatronic ride.
1655.24,1656.24, Yeah.
1656.24,1659.24, Mr. Toads Wild Ride in the super villain town.
1659.24,1661.24, What level is Mr. Clockwork?
1661.24,1663.24, He is level 22.
1663.24,1666.24," Is that, is a doctor of Clockwork or Mr. Clockwork?"
1666.24,1667.24, Doc.
1667.24,1668.24, Doc Clockwork.
1668.24,1669.24, Yeah.
1669.24,1671.24, I don't recognize his degree.
1672.24,1673.24, Yeah.
1673.24,1674.24, What is he a doctor of?
1674.24,1676.24," No, you whole robots."
1676.24,1677.24, I don't know.
1677.24,1678.24, You gotta have answers for this.
1678.24,1680.24," You need the best instrument, man."
1680.24,1683.24," Because if I was a wipper here on that, I came up and I would duck."
1683.24,1684.24, Doc Clockwork.
1684.24,1686.24, What do you a doctor of?
1686.24,1690.24," In the comic book panel, you would totally, you know, come back with some Repartais."
1690.24,1691.24, Doctor of Pain.
1691.24,1692.24, Yours.
1692.24,1694.24, You know what your country phrase?
1694.24,1695.24, I'm a veterinarian.
1695.24,1698.24, I'm a podiatrist.
1698.24,1699.24, I'm a podiatrist.
1699.24,1701.24, I'm kind of an apex tech.
1701.24,1702.24, Do you move oxytools?
1702.24,1703.24, Your veins get a catchphrase.
1703.24,1704.24, The hero's dead.
1704.24,1705.24, They do have a different thing.
1705.24,1707.24, I haven't done any clever catchphrase.
1707.24,1708.24," Oh, dude, come on."
1708.24,1710.24, Your whole heart is going to be a villain.
1710.24,1711.24," Okay, yeah."
1711.24,1714.24," I was going to say, I actually spent time creating a backstory."
1714.24,1717.24," You spent time creating backstory for your lucky charms,"
1717.24,1718.24, Lothry.
1718.24,1719.24," Unlucky charms, by the way."
1719.24,1720.24, Was that his name?
1720.24,1721.24, Yeah.
1721.24,1722.24, A lucky charms.
1722.24,1724.24," Yeah, he was an evil leprechaun, mastermind, who had a hint"
1724.24,1725.24, of thugs.
1725.24,1728.24," And my battle cry was, my wrath is magically delicious."
1728.24,1730.24, See?
1730.24,1731.24, See?
1731.24,1732.24, That's good.
1732.24,1733.24," That's the whole game to me, buddy."
1733.24,1734.24, Right.
1734.24,1735.24, Then you can quit.
1735.24,1736.24, And I hope done.
1736.24,1737.24, Yeah.
1737.24,1738.24, Run around saying that a few times.
1738.24,1739.24, You make the saying.
1739.24,1740.24, Right.
1740.24,1742.24, And then you quit.
1742.24,1743.24, Yeah.
1743.24,1744.24, There.
1744.24,1746.24, There's one game.
1746.24,1749.24, Who's named Shalaphi spoken for fear that I might be a shameless
1749.24,1750.24, Chil.
1750.24,1751.24, What?
1751.24,1752.24, Overlord?
1752.24,1753.24, Yeah.
1753.24,1754.24, Done.
1754.24,1755.24, Okay.
1755.24,1756.24, Next.
1756.24,1757.24," Actually, if you have to check it out."
1757.24,1760.24," If only because it's a free download, free to play game."
1760.24,1761.24, It's free in and out.
1761.24,1762.24, It's a free MMO.
1762.24,1765.24," But it's also, I guess, it's a five bucks a month for like, you know,"
1765.24,1767.24," extras, a lead items, whatever."
1767.24,1769.24," But you know, you can't complain if you're playing the game for free, right?"
1769.24,1770.24, That's the new trend.
1770.24,1771.24, Yeah.
1771.24,1774.24, But it's definitely the oblo inspired.
1774.24,1775.24," It can be as, can run as lower."
1775.24,1776.24, High-reds as you want.
1776.24,1777.24, Is it all instant?
1777.24,1778.24, So for the five bucks you get clothes.
1778.24,1779.24, It's a hub area.
1779.24,1781.24, And then you run in 20 instant world.
1781.24,1782.24," So it's like, go the woods."
1782.24,1783.24," Well, it's a hub area."
1783.24,1784.24, It's a hub area.
1784.24,1786.24, And then you run in 20 instant world.
1786.24,1787.24," So it's like, go the woods."
1787.24,1788.24, Pretty much.
1788.24,1789.24, Okay.
1789.24,1791.24," But I mean, you know, even with guild wars, you know,"
1791.24,1793.24, technically it's kind of the reverse.
1793.24,1794.24, You're paying for the game.
1794.24,1795.24, And then it's online for free.
1795.24,1796.24, Mm-hmm.
1796.24,1798.24," But in this case, you know, it's, it's worth jog."
1798.24,1800.24, At least downloading and trying.
1800.24,1803.24," I was, I mean, it's kind of mindless like, you know, just like,"
1803.24,1807.24, kind of that same kind of multiple clicking the oblo kind of gameplay.
1807.24,1808.24, That's it.
1808.24,1810.24, Why would I want to play it instead of just the oblo?
1810.24,1811.24, I'm just asking.
1811.24,1813.24," And I'm just saying, well, it's, it's got a tongue in,"
1813.24,1815.24," from what I've played so far, which isn't a whole lot."
1815.24,1818.24," I'm not sure, but it's like, well, obviously better graphics,"
1818.24,1820.24, but also kind of a tongue in cheek sensey humor.
1820.24,1821.24, Mm-hmm.
1821.24,1825.24," So like, you know, low, you know, goofy items, like a cardboard crossbow."
1825.24,1828.24," It's like, you know, it kind of has a self-referential sensey humor"
1828.24,1829.24, about itself.
1829.24,1830.24, Mm-hmm.
1830.24,1834.24," So, um, I'm enjoying it for, I mean, I was enjoying that for what it was."
1834.24,1835.24, Mm-hmm.
1835.24,1837.24," Uh, and on that same kick, I was, I also started playing a,"
1837.24,1839.24, have you guys checked out this free style basketball game?
1839.24,1840.24, No.
1840.24,1841.24, Uh.
1841.24,1844.24," That, that, that's that huge Korean thing, right?"
1844.24,1845.24, It's exactly as a huge thing in Korean.
1845.24,1848.24," I'm like, is there something I miss about sports games?"
1848.24,1852.24," You know what I think is, it's actually, it's actually a good basketball game."
1852.24,1854.24," I mean, it's just like, you know, so, so I'm amazed,"
1854.24,1857.24," and you obviously, you, it's skill-based."
1857.24,1859.24," And as you go on, you can, you know,"
1859.24,1862.24," you know, obviously buy, you know, pay-in-to-buy-more-skills and stuff,"
1862.24,1863.24," which then it becomes, right?"
1863.24,1864.24," You know, it's escalation."
1864.24,1869.24," Well, this, I think this is the model for the, for the micro payment online game, right?"
1869.24,1870.24, Exactly.
1870.24,1872.24," And it's going, and I was kind of curious to see kind of how,"
1872.24,1878.24," it's picking it out, how it's being revealed here and how it people are going to kind of get into it."
1878.24,1880.24," What, what are the micro payment?"
1880.24,1882.24," Well, the mic, in, in this case of this game,"
1882.24,1886.24," you can buy shoes and pants, and it sounds stupid, and it kind of is,"
1886.24,1890.24," but each of these things kind of add, like, extra skill points and stuff."
1890.24,1891.24," You sure, I know you're making it."
1891.24,1892.24," Yeah, right?"
1892.24,1893.24," It's too, you want to say, right?"
1893.24,1895.24," No, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,"
1895.24,1897.24," Hey, real cash for fake ass shoes."
1898.24,1900.24," Yeah, I, I mean, let's just, I mean, I'm trying to stupid."
1900.24,1902.24," Come on, we kind of, I know you said it."
1902.24,1904.24," No, well, I mean, it's, it's, it's not even that."
1904.24,1907.24," I mean, the, it's, associate values to the items."
1907.24,1910.24," So it's like, you know, it being, oh, God, I get to buy some Nike sneakers."
1910.24,1913.24," It's like sneakers that can, like, improve my jumping skills or something."
1913.24,1916.24," Oh, they were back in the whole, they ran, they ran, they ran."
1916.24,1918.24," That's the, they ran with the, they had to help with the,"
1918.24,1920.24," the hellgate stuff, you know, basically it is,"
1920.24,1921.24, buying yourself.
1921.24,1922.24, It totally is.
1922.24,1923.24, You're buying yourself a leap of performance.
1923.24,1924.24, So why do you want to play that?
1925.24,1929.24," Someone who's dumb enough to buy a bunch of like elite basketball gear can,"
1929.24,1931.24, like dunk on your shit over and over again.
1931.24,1934.24," You can't even like touch the touch the fucking ram on your,"
1934.24,1935.24, your best day.
1935.24,1937.24," Yeah, but then the internet is your house."
1937.24,1938.24, Show.
1938.24,1942.24," Yeah, I just get out of my house."
1942.24,1946.24," I know, and that's actually, that's, that's the genuine question that I've been curious about as well."
1946.24,1948.24," It's like, how well, that's going to play here."
1948.24,1951.24," Is, is it a, and then when that, and then play on the court is,"
1951.24,1952.24, controlled by a person?
1952.24,1956.24," You can play like, you could do a, like, I guess, a, I could have practiced match against, like,"
1956.24,1959.24," some, I guess, some, a couple of box and drills and stuff, but otherwise,"
1959.24,1960.24, you're playing against people online.
1960.24,1963.24," It's like, like, like, five or four, yeah, five or six."
1963.24,1964.24," Yeah, I mean, it's, it's three on three."
1964.24,1965.24, You're in three.
1965.24,1967.24," And then, and then you can actually like, you know, you, obviously there's, like,"
1967.24,1969.24," level, it's like, you're not going to be playing against some level,"
1969.24,1972.24," like, level awesome guy who's going to be able to dunk on in your ass every time."
1972.24,1976.24," You're kind of putting the same, like, level, skill areas."
1976.24,1978.24," So you actually, like, as you're playing your character,"
1978.24,1981.24," you're going to get extra skills and you, and you do get some points,"
1981.24,1984.24," just not as many, just from, like, you know,"
1984.24,1986.24," you're, you're, you're a victory, you pull off some moves, whatever,"
1986.24,1988.24, and it kind of goes into a pot.
1988.24,1990.24," Um, that strikes me as an evil model."
1990.24,1992.24, It is the basketball game itself.
1992.24,1993.24," I was, I was, I was having fun."
1993.24,1995.24," I mean, it's basically, it's, it's kind of basic, but it's,"
1995.24,1998.24," it's not like a full 3D map, because I mean, it's kind of like,"
1998.24,2001.24," a top, you know, you, this double dribble shit."
2001.24,2002.24," Yeah, exactly."
2002.24,2003.24, It's a 2D map.
2003.24,2005.24, You just hit up and down through a soma.
2006.24,2008.24, Three frames of animation up on the dark with an allow.
2008.24,2009.24, Eight bit stuck.
2009.24,2010.24, I'm on a hammer.
2010.24,2011.24, Time for a hammer.
2011.24,2014.24, Hit that reset button because it's talking to me.
2014.24,2017.24," No, it's kind of like, um, remember that shit, right?"
2017.24,2018.24, Yeah.
2018.24,2019.24," Oh, yeah."
2019.24,2021.24," So excited when I came talk to me, I just would sit there and hit the reset button."
2021.24,2022.24, What the hell?
2022.24,2023.24," You know, it kind of reminds me of it."
2023.24,2024.24, Got her behind cock with it.
2024.24,2025.24," What, what, what?"
2025.24,2028.24," I took a kind of hair, I like that, like, a stop motion, like,"
2028.24,2031.24, there's only like three frames of it.
2031.24,2032.24, Exactly.
2032.24,2037.24," And it reminds me of, uh, like being an arcades in the day and, and going in and watching us play."
2037.24,2039.24," And the guys playing it would always be these big,"
2039.24,2040.24, fucking fat guys.
2040.24,2041.24, I know it.
2041.24,2043.24," And I know we've, I know we've ripped on fat people."
2043.24,2046.24," Or we've got, we've got, we've got a bad mail about it."
2046.24,2053.24," And I'm sorry if you're overweight and it's a problem, but I always just think going into the arcade and, and see guys,"
2053.24,2058.24," like, that is like two, why don't you guys try to be a bit just on our message board played about for those."
2058.24,2063.24," Like, I got so many, a few bad watches of people saying that like dude, I found three today after all."
2063.24,2066.24," Like, my whole school's playing this shit now."
2066.24,2067.24, I'm indicated.
2067.24,2068.24, Right.
2068.24,2072.24," I'm just saying that it used to bother me to go into the arcade and see guys like three in the afternoon,"
2072.24,2075.24, playing like a one-on-one arcade basketball game.
2075.24,2078.24," And, you know, they could stand the lose about 150 pounds each."
2078.24,2082.24," And it's like, go outside and play some real basketball for fuck's sake."
2082.24,2085.24, There's just one thing I could ever say.
2085.24,2088.24, Don't play a video game people.
2088.24,2089.24, Yeah.
2089.24,2091.24," Oh, yeah. I run a video game magazine. I'm sorry."
2091.24,2094.24, Don't play real sports by games.
2094.24,2096.24, Go larp play well.
2096.24,2098.24, Yeah.
2098.24,2101.24," I know, just here's how many places that could go that you don't want it to."
2101.24,2102.24," I guess, right?"
2102.24,2104.24, I guess it would be at the front run at the front run.
2104.24,2105.24, You're right.
2105.24,2106.24, Yeah.
2106.24,2107.24, Play it.
2107.24,2110.24," But there's just something about that, especially when they're like trash."
2110.24,2111.24, I dunked all over your ass.
2111.24,2114.24," I mean, it's like you're saying they couldn't dunk in real life."
2114.24,2117.24," Oh, no, no, no, they're too fat because they don't exercise because they're playing games."
2117.24,2120.24," So, as it's a video game, I wouldn't say it."
2120.24,2124.24," You couldn't beat the Zergob Dawn Armada in real life, you know what I mean?"
2124.24,2125.24, I could.
2125.24,2127.24, I'm ready for them.
2127.24,2129.24, I have my 10-fold hat ready.
2129.24,2132.24," No, but like, I remember like back in, like, just double jubbles specifically."
2132.24,2137.24," I remember like, I went to my local, like the local pizza place and like, they had a double drum machine all set up there."
2137.24,2140.24," And this dude, every day after school he'd be there, like,"
2141.24,2145.24," he's fad dripping over like the, the pan all these like the rolls."
2145.24,2149.24," The roll's going to come in and he'd master the dunk on people and he'd just go,"
2149.24,2152.24," Oh, oh, like you see like, just,"
2152.24,2154.24," Wow, something like a wild boss."
2154.24,2157.24," He was totally like, he was totally, he was totally jabba."
2157.24,2158.24, Oh yeah.
2158.24,2161.24," Oh man, but he was so proud of himself with his like,"
2161.24,2166.24," So for that game, my whole thing is like, if you took like a really, you know, well done,"
2167.24,2170.24," basketball existing, you know, like, he a basketball game and NBA or something."
2170.24,2172.24, And then you added all that other stuff.
2172.24,2173.24, It's gonna be a huge fun.
2173.24,2177.24," But I mean, if, if, if, if, if the game itself just is, is really rudimentary."
2177.24,2179.24," Yeah, but maybe it's a good basketball."
2179.24,2183.24," It's kind of, I think it's, it's NBA street, but it's got more like an RPG depth to it."
2183.24,2186.24," So it's, it's interesting in that respect."
2186.24,2188.24," And, uh, what, I mean, would,"
2188.24,2191.24," are people willing to pay for that, like on, you know,"
2191.24,2193.24, on a paper item basis?
2193.24,2194.24, I don't know.
2194.24,2195.24, That's a pretty bold statement.
2195.24,2200.24," No, no, no, that it's like, that it's got, that's just like NBA street level of play."
2200.24,2202.24," What, so what else can you buy?"
2202.24,2203.24, Just clothes or whatever.
2203.24,2206.24," Well, no, so you're also paying for skills, too, like, you like, do like,"
2206.24,2211.24," special jokes and, can you, like, you know, earn your skills through regular play?"
2211.24,2212.24," Yeah, I did it a slower rate."
2212.24,2213.24, Okay.
2213.24,2217.24," Uh, I play that, uh, about street home court for 360 play that."
2217.24,2218.24," You love the game, right?"
2218.24,2219.24, It's pretty fun.
2219.24,2220.24, Yeah.
2220.24,2221.24, Other weapons in this one on my game.
2221.24,2222.24, You can't.
2222.24,2223.24, Sadly no.
2223.24,2224.24, No.
2225.24,2227.24," No, just can't have weapons with their D."
2227.24,2229.24," They don't actually want to, like,"
2229.24,2230.24, it doesn't really annoy me about it.
2230.24,2232.24," And then, like, this is almost like unforgivable."
2232.24,2234.24," Like, you can't, there's no game path."
2234.24,2236.24," I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't hook it at game path."
2236.24,2237.24, So you're using your keyboard to play a basketball game.
2237.24,2238.24, It seems kind of stupid.
2238.24,2240.24," Well, Darren, you're playing a PC game."
2240.24,2241.24, I know.
2241.24,2243.24," Yeah, but you forget it."
2243.24,2245.24, But how many times did play a bit?
2245.24,2247.24," And a day, a days of high heat baseball."
2247.24,2248.24, Everyone used the game pad.
2248.24,2249.24, True.
2249.24,2250.24, I was messing with you.
2250.24,2251.24, I know.
2251.24,2253.24, You never played much sports games.
2253.24,2254.24, I don't know.
2254.24,2255.24, Mutant League footballs about things.
2255.24,2256.24, Mutant League.
2256.24,2257.24, Did you ever play?
2257.24,2259.24, Can you ever play a bunch out?
2259.24,2260.24, A bunch out of the code.
2260.24,2261.24, Here it is.
2261.24,2262.24, What's a sports game?
2262.24,2264.24, And ice hockey and Mario golf.
2264.24,2265.24, Mario golf.
2265.24,2266.24, Mario golf.
2266.24,2267.24, Yeah.
2267.24,2268.24," Oh, it does."
2268.24,2269.24, The Netflix.
2269.24,2270.24," Actually, that counts more than RPG."
2270.24,2272.24," You're going to make me mad, though, right?"
2272.24,2274.24," There's that whole click of kids that, uh,"
2274.24,2276.24, they won't touch any sports games.
2276.24,2280.24, But then they find out like you can unlock Mario or Princess Peach and it or something.
2280.24,2281.24, Suddenly they care.
2281.24,2284.24," They totally, it's like their favorite shit in the world."
2284.24,2285.24, You know what I'm saying?
2285.24,2287.24," You saw every time it happens with like, it's a sports game."
2287.24,2288.24, It's a sports game.
2288.24,2289.24, It's a sports game.
2289.24,2290.24, Yeah.
2290.24,2291.24," You're like, if people are like, oh, great."
2291.24,2292.24, What is there for this system?
2292.24,2296.24," Just a bunch of like, fucking sports games and, you know, and brain dead shooters."
2296.24,2299.24," And then like as soon as they announce the same game, but you can unlock Mario."
2299.24,2302.24," And when they're like, oh, God, this is incredible."
2302.24,2304.24," I don't want you to be that person, man."
2304.24,2307.24," Oh, I don't play golf, but oh, you don't play Mario golf."
2307.24,2309.24, I'll be that.
2309.24,2310.24, I'll be that.
2310.24,2311.24, I'm that person.
2311.24,2313.24, Or you might all be that person.
2313.24,2314.24, So I'll do that.
2314.24,2317.24, That doesn't sound so bad.
2317.24,2319.24," I played two Mario golf socks, actually."
2319.24,2321.24, I try to play Tiger Woods and Mario golf.
2321.24,2323.24," No, it's nice and I'll track."
2323.24,2325.24," No, it's just like, you just want to hit it."
2325.24,2328.24," You don't have to bank a ball of a flower, so I'm flowering."
2328.24,2331.24," I mean, at least something that I like the envelope stuff and the whole, you know,"
2331.24,2334.24," it's essentially descended from, you know, the Golden Tea Track Ball type."
2334.24,2337.24, They only tell my play it is when we have a group of people.
2337.24,2340.24, So I kind of want something that doesn't feel high maintenance.
2340.24,2343.24, And I don't even know if Tiger Woods is high maintenance.
2343.24,2344.24, I don't even touch it.
2344.24,2348.24, Mario golf appeals to the crowd of random people walking in the house.
2348.24,2351.24," Although I will say it could be, it could be better on we."
2351.24,2352.24, That's the new thing.
2352.24,2354.24, It's like that would be so much better on we.
2354.24,2355.24, Yeah.
2355.24,2357.24, That would be so much better on Ninja Gold.
2357.24,2360.24," You know, you know, Ninja Gold is a little better on that."
2360.24,2361.24, That would be the size.
2361.24,2363.24, Be better on Ninja Gold.
2363.24,2364.24, Yeah.
2364.24,2365.24, Okay.
2365.24,2366.24, Take a break.
2366.24,2367.24," Where we take, okay."
2367.24,2368.24, Before we take a break.
2368.24,2371.24," We got, we're going to go out and style here."
2371.24,2372.24," No, we're real quick."
2372.24,2375.24," We got this, uh, we get this email."
2375.24,2376.24," Oh, that thing."
2376.24,2377.24, Oh yeah.
2377.24,2379.24, And really go out and see if it was awesome.
2379.24,2383.24," It was in the face of me because, okay, this subject, well, it was amazing first because it was like,"
2383.24,2386.24," in a whiskey nerd skit, like three weeks ago or whatever,"
2386.24,2390.24," I had him basically chilling doing like, you know,"
2390.24,2393.24, grill a marketing on message boards for food stuff.
2393.24,2396.24, Like air pockets and pockets and shit.
2396.24,2400.24, And then all of a sudden I get this email and the subject line is next gen food for next
2400.24,2401.24, gen gamers.
2401.24,2403.24, It was like holy shit.
2403.24,2406.24," Like my alternate ego, like somehow emailed me."
2406.24,2408.24, Did you think with a joke at first or not?
2408.24,2409.24, I thought it was a joke.
2409.24,2410.24, Yeah.
2410.24,2411.24," I was like, okay."
2411.24,2412.24, I totally got the same thing on the photos of Joe.
2412.24,2413.24, Then I opened it and here's what I got.
2413.24,2416.24," And I'm, okay, by the way, my name is not Rory, but it says,"
2416.24,2417.24," Hi, Rory."
2417.24,2418.24, There's a fan of computer gaming worlds.
2418.24,2419.24, Also notice that.
2419.24,2421.24, You're getting a name and wrong magazine.
2421.24,2422.24, Great.
2422.24,2426.24, I'm happy to offer you some quality feel for your late night sessions.
2426.24,2429.24, I represent Carl's junior in Harvey's new spicy buff.
2429.24,2430.24," Oh, chicken sandwich."
2430.24,2432.24," I thought we were not, I thought we're going to blanket."
2432.24,2433.24," Oh, it was the blanket."
2433.24,2434.24," Oh, well, that's fine."
2434.24,2436.24, Because now we can turn it back on them.
2436.24,2440.24," Like, notice they don't represent Carl's junior and hearty's."
2440.24,2443.24, But they specifically represent a spicy buff low chicken sandwich.
2443.24,2444.24, Yeah.
2444.24,2445.24, That really made me laugh.
2446.24,2450.24," I told you I wanted us to write back and say, like, we like your idea,"
2450.24,2453.24, but we'd rather talk to a representative for one of your other standards.
2453.24,2456.24," So, yeah."
2456.24,2458.24," Personally, I like your curly fries."
2458.24,2461.24, Can I support the sweet things that you're trying to say?
2461.24,2469.24," So then they go on to say, and I'll skip the spill about when they're trying to convince me why this is the taste of the shit that I've never eaten."
2469.24,2473.24," Since you're in the games, you might like to play with our lunch invite widget."
2473.24,2480.24, You can make a lunch date with Ashley Hartman and you can train her to lick a lollipop to the robot or take the elevator.
2480.24,2484.24, Send an invite to your friend or use it to remind your coworker that they still low you'll meal.
2484.24,2489.24," Either way, you get a dollar off coupon at the end and you'll get to see a gorgeous girl that you're bidding."
2489.24,2492.24," Of course, if you're off email, blood else, you probably used to it."
2492.24,2497.24," Now, at that point, I was thinking to a spam where they just inserted like some name."
2497.24,2500.24, They just inserted like they got the name of the magazine right.
2500.24,2505.24," But then it's like, at least took the time to say like the blood else shit. That threw me."
2505.24,2508.24," I was like, someone right. This shit just for me."
2508.24,2514.24," You know, but then I was like, no, I'm sure EGM got one and it just said like inserted like a large craft for blood offer, whatever."
2514.24,2522.24," You know, but, but, but, but so you have this widget is basically there's like this chick that wants to put on her."
2522.24,2525.24," For one like on my website, yeah, let me do that for you."
2525.24,2530.24," We put a widget of Ashley, what's her department, linking Lolly Pop on my website."
2530.24,2533.24, That I don't have.
2533.24,2536.24," But it's like, what the fuck, why would you want to do that?"
2536.24,2545.24," And then anyway, she says, either link, either link will make you a lunch date with Ashley, no clicking required, no extra clicking required."
2545.24,2550.24," And Ashley might not actually show up, but you can still get fired up over that extra dollar in your wallet."
2550.24,2552.24, What the hell? So she may not even show up?
2553.24,2557.24, What does that know on my spot? How did they even apply she even made?
2557.24,2562.24," Okay, that's just, I don't know, that's the bulk of it, but I just thought that was pretty sad."
2562.24,2571.24," It kind of reminds me of like if anyone uses like instant messengers now, a various sorts of MSN is particularly, and Yahoo are particularly offensive that they're the shit's called Winks."
2571.24,2573.24, That's a hot thing.
2573.24,2580.24," And it's like, when you, you know how there's the tradition of smiley and stuff, because you can't just type, hey, I'm smiling and have it say the same."
2580.24,2597.24," So then you got a picture of smiling fool. But now with Winks, there's like when you, when you can't possibly find a way to say like dodge trucks are sturdy, you hit this button and it changes the background and all of a sudden a big dodge truck and flash goes by that phrase often come to your mind."
2597.24,2603.24," It's a death like how mom, I'm talking to you and I love you and I know it's just mother's day, but check it."
2603.24,2608.24," And then it's just like, even crystal light because I believe in me."
2609.24,2613.24," So while you've got like five pro, pro as you, you're sponsored by dodge."
2613.24,2617.24, That's like those why I'm in fireman. So I was showing you.
2617.24,2619.24," Yeah, the, like what is the shit?"
2619.24,2622.24," Yeah, the messenger you can like load a background that's like, you know, just got toilet."
2622.24,2624.24," Yeah, that's all over the place."
2624.24,2625.24, But I know about them.
2625.24,2627.24, Why I download them to piss people off.
2627.24,2628.24, Right.
2628.24,2630.24, But it's like maybe that was maybe on the butt of their joke.
2630.24,2633.24," Maybe they're like, there's no one who's ever going to send this to someone seriously."
2633.24,2635.24, It doesn't matter whether they think they're being ironic or not.
2635.24,2637.24, They're still advertising our bullshit stuff.
2637.24,2646.24," And so it's like my little avatar off like a some foot, what did I football do like run it back and forth like the corny is flash you've ever seen and just like, but you're right or movie."
2646.24,2650.24, She's flying on the jokes on you man. You're doing their PR for them.
2650.24,2651.24, Right.
2651.24,2653.24, Just like we just did for what's her face.
2653.24,2654.24, So actually Hartman here.
2654.24,2656.24, I got the last day with Ashley.
2656.24,2658.24, So I'm also for next week.
2658.24,2662.24," I'm not going to mention a name, but like as I'm looking at the woman who we sent out this email."
2662.24,2664.24," Yeah, I'm wondering if like she wakes up the morning."
2664.24,2665.24, Looks in the mirror goes.
2665.24,2666.24, I got to do this again.
2666.24,2668.24," Yeah, that's like, how do you feel about that?"
2668.24,2673.24, At least this person you had the decency to say they were representing the sandwich and not pretend that they were.
2673.24,2675.24, I'm a spicy wing sandwich.
2675.24,2676.24, I don't represent it.
2676.24,2685.24," Yeah, I wonder if she's like, and I want to, where do you think she is on the, that's from the latter of PR apps is it like other people aspiring to represent the buffalo chicken sandwich?"
2685.24,2688.24," You know, like there's other girls on the office going like that bitch."
2688.24,2689.24, And then we got to come to the exit.
2689.24,2692.24, I can't believe she got the buffalo chicken sandwich.
2692.24,2694.24, I was so sure to be me.
2694.24,2695.24, They represent the line of sandwiches.
2695.24,2699.24," Yeah, maybe that that that you start out at Filaeo Fish."
2699.24,2702.24, Like bottom of like the shit fish.
2702.24,2704.24," Yeah, shit with you."
2704.24,2706.24," Like, let's call in if I just work a little harder."
2706.24,2708.24, I can get the buffalo chicken sandwich.
2708.24,2710.24, Jellys of the wap are guys like I isn't it to do anything.
2710.24,2711.24, Right.
2711.24,2713.24, To sell themselves those wapers.
2713.24,2717.24," If she's listening to me back now for my reward, you can keep the dollar off keep on."
2717.24,2720.24, Just just tell me how you felt when you typed that out.
2720.24,2725.24, How much you sold crumbled every day with every letter sure of.
2725.24,2728.24, I felt a lot of money going to my bank account.
2728.24,2729.24," Yeah, no kid."
2729.24,2731.24, He's probably making more than ass of jokes on ass.
2731.24,2733.24," Yeah, but she's getting paid in buffalo wings."
2733.24,2734.24, Let's go take a break.
2734.24,2735.24, That's still sounds alright.
2735.24,2738.24," Okay, we'll be back soon."
2738.24,2741.24," Three, two, one, here the best."

2778.24,2779.24, Game on.
2809.24,2812.24, I'd Ralphie went nerdcourt.
2812.24,2815.24, He's a bit angry now this to these days.
2815.24,2819.24," Yeah, he's the least for a few weeks and he comes back angry and rapping."
2819.24,2820.24, He's got some gold.
2820.24,2823.24, He got some gold fronts too and no doubt.
2823.24,2826.24," Good to have you back, Ralphie."
2826.24,2828.24, I'll stay away so long.
2828.24,2831.24, So one thing that we wanted to talk about.
2831.24,2832.24," Yes, sir."
2832.24,2837.24, We continually bring up griefing and goofballing.
2837.24,2838.24," Yeah, causing trouble."
2838.24,2840.24, Maybe I'm in online games.
2840.24,2841.24, We do.
2841.24,2845.74," And a couple weeks ago, you know, when it last talked about it, I very, it was a joke when I said it."
2845.74,2858.24," But I said that in one of the rings online, the ability to go and do some social engineering might make the game worthwhile because collecting the five, you know, cheap, health and stuff alone isn't incentive enough to play the game."
2858.24,2866.24," It was a joke, but I was serious to the extent that I do think that the social engineering and things that people will do or just the stuff that just kind of have"
2866.24,2871.24, happened to emerge in those games is often more entertaining than the missions that they give you.
2871.24,2884.24," And even if you don't believe in goofballing and messing around, I think you'll agree that sometimes when even you shine or playing world of aircraft, you're having a much better time talking with your guildmates as you're sort of like casually clicking on monsters."
2884.24,2885.24," No, yeah, totally."
2885.24,2893.24," It is a completely technical and at this point in time, a cliche term almost of emergent gameplay."
2893.24,2894.24, Right.
2894.24,2895.24, The game makers call it.
2895.24,2901.24," So a few things surprised me, one of the captain of Calester on the forums which are now gone."
2901.24,2906.24," We've been, you know, merged into one Uber form now, but he said that,"
2906.24,2916.24, Sean and others on GFW are always talking about trying to elevate games to the level of film and supporting griefing is not the way to do this.
2916.24,2923.24," When Roger Ebert sees a film he hates, he writes a critical review pointing out the film's flaws and then goes on to see it goes on to something he likes more."
2923.24,2928.24, He does not go to the theater and ruin the film for people who might not like or who might like you.
2928.24,2934.24," So, as you seem beyond value of the dolls, immediately, I mean, the whole thing there was like,"
2934.24,2936.24," I mean, and everyone else could chime in."
2936.24,2939.24," If you do it, you can speak from a position of the military."
2939.24,2945.24," If you don't, if you're Ryan, if you turn dot hate this stuff, although I know secretly you cause a mayhem in Ultima."
2945.24,2946.24," Oh, yeah."
2946.24,2952.24," But the whole thing there is like, what an inappropriate analogy for one to say that like the experience of,"
2952.24,2962.24," of watching a movie is like an MMO and then instead of of us doing something in that environment is basically the same of like being a obnoxious and talking on our cell phone and other movies,"
2962.24,2972.24," because rather than people that were sitting there and watching this passive experience unfold with everyone else in the game, we're all principal agents, we're actors in this thing together."
2972.24,2981.24," And part of the very draw of that genre is our presence there, because if you strip that away, you've got essentially a very, very dull and repetitive RPG."
2981.24,2986.24," Right, it would be more like if you went to somebody's house while they were playing a single player game."
2986.24,2987.24," Yeah, sure."
2987.24,2990.24, But you should exactly sat on their couch and given them shit.
2990.24,3005.24," And so a few things that I wanted to say, like, first is that when we say grieving, so there's no misconception, it's not like we're just kicking sand in the face of the scrawny and it's not like we're going and we're using hacks and we're just team killing you and stuff like that."
3005.24,3018.24," Like some of the examples I gave, you know, before we're staging fake contest and stuff and they turn out of tricks or like, you know, recently and I did get on alerted the rings online, one thing we did is the usual, the game's got voice chat."
3018.24,3034.24," We get someone in it and you make up this whole spiel and like example, you know, it's telling the guy that, you know, I'm a serious that I'm the leader, this is my chance to be the leader and I want all transmissions to be concluded with over and I got, you know, I get this guy like going along."
3034.24,3044.24," And then I told, you know, like our characters are Ralphie and Dar Down, we retain we're like kind of brothers of what would be a PC way of saying of dubious mental capacity."
3044.24,3047.24," And so, so you know, like in red apolite."
3047.24,3063.24," And I'm just telling the stories about, yeah, you know, it's like, you know, tell them, yeah, I haven't read the books because grandma won't let us, but she says we're allowed to play the because they're satanic and I, you know, say like, is it true that, you know, if you read the books sometimes you wake up at night and you'll have a devil on your chest and it makes it hard for you to breathe."
3063.24,3079.24," And it all this isn't a messed up voice. And then the guy's like going along is like, you know, pretty much, and then I tell him, it's like, you know, we're allowed to play this game because we're allowed only if we roll play because grandma won't just use our imaginations."
3079.24,3092.24," And a lot of games don't take imagination. You know, grandma has imagination too because great on on her car on her car. There's a sticker that says in case a rapture, this vehicle will be on man."
3092.24,3097.24, So sometimes she'll just start squirving around to make people think that it's already the rapture.
3097.24,3105.24," So like, we'll just be talking just going off and off like that shit with this guy, you know, and all of a sudden, I mean, to me, that's radically different for one."
3105.24,3113.24," In that case, that guy can be grief no more than he wants to. All he needs to do is kick out of the fellowship or click mute or any of these things."
3113.24,3117.24, And it's so completely stupid and ridiculous.
3117.24,3131.24," That it's like, if you're going to get mad at that, well, fuck you, you know, like just turn it off, like I said, and it's not like, I mean, that's like loose goofballing, you know, and then analogy that comes to mind is there's a simple about fit on the East Coast called in Prague everywhere."
3131.24,3148.24," And they'll basically just engage in social engineering, but like real life. And it's somewhat just crazy and awesome. I think they do phenomenal stuff. One example would be they find a local band and say you're, you played a few shithole bars or something, you know, and like you get a show at one."
3148.24,3156.24," And then they show up with like 60 people in their group that they all get to go and they're all like they practice in advance and they all, they know all the lyrics of the songs."
3156.24,3163.24," And as you go up there and you play, you're thinking like maybe five friends are showing and then like a bunch of boosers and my darts in the background might wander up to the stage now and then."
3163.24,3170.24," And all of a sudden you've got a full house. They're like singing every, every morning that you're doing, you know, helping their fish and shit."
3170.24,3174.24," And then like when you go out back, they're all just running and asking for honor."
3174.24,3180.24," I have some like boom, a second later they all just vanish. And then you're like, what the hell was that? Like how did that happen?"
3180.24,3186.24," And it was an interesting story on that as they did on a pyrr later and said, you know, most of the band guys were like."
3186.24,3193.24," It wasn't crap. They realized that they got pranked, but they're like, wow, like how how many times in your life are you going to have an experience like death that you can talk about now."
3193.24,3196.24, I'm not saying grandma in a rapture ready truck is quite the same.
3196.24,3201.24," Right, which is amazing. But at the same time, there was the band member who's it was just crushed him."
3201.24,3204.24, It just like it was so like it just like her is just.
3204.24,3212.24," Yeah, I was going to say, because I was I was in a band in my younger years. And we played all the crappy places in Berkeley and and Oakland in San Francisco."
3212.24,3225.24," And I would usually be that it'd be like all of our girlfriends and you know, and friends and and the people who hung out in the bar normally and after we played for a while, we got it teeny tiny little following like 30 people or whatever."
3225.24,3231.24," But if there was a huge crowd to say, I didn't know, yeah, more people that want to hear you play a clarinet, or the reason why I didn't ever want to hear you."
3231.24,3237.24," It's not true. It's true. It does, but it actually tells me I made the right career choice rock musician, not the way to go."
3237.24,3246.24," But but think when you're telling the story, that's exactly what I was thinking like what if this big group huge group came in and did that and I realized I was up there and they were goofing on me."
3246.24,3248.24," Yeah, I probably would have thought really shit."
3248.24,3258.24," Yeah, yeah, that's totally bugged out there here, just because they're making fun of us because we're losing or no, they didn't, but they didn't realize it was even more like crushing form because they believed in the illusion the entire time."
3258.24,3267.24," And it was when he realized what happened afterward, he had already felt like he just like the highest sort of like, just a dolphin, you know, rush he'd ever had."
3267.24,3274.24," He just was on top of the world and then just to realize that it was all just predicated on a bunch of bullshit, you know, they pulled the rug out and it just kind of crushed it."
3274.24,3287.24," Yeah, but they did all kinds of stuff like that. They'll go into Starbucks and repeat a scene over with three actors where someone spills his coffee on the so on and they'll just keep repeating it at 35 minute intervals over and over and over and over and over as a test people feel, I mean, they do all kinds of stuff like that."
3287.24,3292.24," But anyway, I think I ever, I respect for that kind of thing where it takes some work right here."
3292.24,3295.24, And in preaking another like that's just like goofing.
3295.24,3305.24," I mean, in Ashara on's called to Robert coffee and I one day, we were we were two characters. He was Mike Mike Oxbig last name, oh X, the IG."
3305.24,3312.24," Oh, he was just a couple of mature guys here, but so he was Mike Oxbig and I was his brother York, York Oxbig."
3313.24,3325.24," And we would we would go around in this game, just do random shit and this one day we just went into like it was like a crossroads area out in the middle of his own and he and I built us like laid down on our backs."
3325.24,3333.24," Okay, and that's all we did. We just lay down and then this dude like runs by and he stops and he's like, what do you guys who and we're like, we're just laying here. You want to join us."
3333.24,3341.24," So he does too and then other people started coming by and they would like like look around like type WTF and we're just like, what I would just all in here."
3341.24,3345.24," Chill out, you guys want to chat with me and then they lay down watching."
3345.24,3355.24, And then soon we had a whole field of bodies. We had like a sleeping in Ashara on's called to and I was just completely random and people laughed.
3355.24,3357.24," You know, it had nothing to do with the game whatsoever."
3358.24,3375.24," And that is more I don't know, I think that like you're going to like of all the things you did Nash around's called that's one of the things you remember and the other thing I remember was a little more griefing like but it was still just a goof was we found out that if you do the sit you could do the sit animation in the game which puts you cross like it right."
3375.24,3381.24, But why you were sitting you could still do a slash follow. So you would you could follow players.
3381.24,3387.24," Yeah, exactly. Hence the outside you're still sitting. So basically looks like you got people on like a magic carpet behind it."
3387.24,3398.24, So we would just Robert and I would just pick some random guy and just go on follow sitting down and never and then and not stop even you know he'd be typing like not do it's really I'm not kidding cut it out.
3398.24,3403.24, And he just be running all over with these two cross like guys following him in the air.
3403.24,3417.24," And that was the birth of the as a fire in the ass as a fire started. Yeah, we formed our own guilt the ass as a fire. But you know, and eventually he logged off because he was pissed off that guy posted on her forums by the way."
3417.24,3419.24, So speak another guy.
3419.24,3424.24," Yeah, he's okay. So read it. His name is Baron Clambody and he's like the end of all care bears."
3424.24,3432.24, But we love him. He says rude behavior in a public place is rebaving there's no difference from griefers in an MMO and a group of teenagers talking.
3432.24,3446.24," On cell phone, stirring a movie. And this was after I posted and talked about how they're all these ways to get out of it. You know, and then also the nature of an MMO by default is not that of a movie watching a movie in a public space."
3446.24,3457.24, So it says you say people don't accept griefers in the MMO. They should play single player game. That's no different from saying people don't expect cell phone using teenagers in the theater that they should stay home and watch a DVD.
3458.24,3466.24, You want to you want to grief and another people's gaming experience that they paid for in the company running the MMO doesn't mind them chasing off other customers. That's fine.
3466.24,3473.24," In a short time you end up with a small community of griefers, griefing griefers or it is better or as it is better known, Ultima Online."
3474.24,3483.24, You're just wasting your time trying to justify it to me or anyone else because you're debating from a week foundation.
3483.24,3488.24, So I don't know. I just compared that to you think as a point at all.
3488.24,3497.24," Well, depending on how you look at it and how he's interpreting what I had to say, you know, I mean to the extent that like you're able to extricate yourself from these situations is different."
3497.24,3505.24, And it's not the equivalent of having to get up and leave the theater and go it would be like if you could press a button and make that person just disappear from the theater.
3505.24,3507.24," If you had power, you know."
3507.24,3516.24, And just once again saying that it's like I honestly believe it if you want just the experience of the game as the designers intended it.
3516.24,3525.24," Like what's to say why not play single player and I didn't just say hey go play single player buddy if you don't like what I say was like you have options of playing with guilds with you know,"
3525.24,3534.24," clans and of controlling your environment you know, and if it's that important to you and if you're that worried about someone doing something unpredictable in online space."
3534.24,3542.24, I think it's a fair suggestion to say what will maybe you either need to be much more selective and who you're allowing yourself to be exposed to or play single player.
3542.24,3545.24, You can put on a massive nor you could join.
3545.24,3549.24, I don't know another server aware there's less of noxious people.
3549.24,3550.24, I mean they're let's.
3550.24,3552.24, I mean like I mean they have RP servers for a reason.
3553.24,3562.24," Yeah, I'm a opinion like in any game if the designers give you the means to do something and you and it's not an exploit right the go for it."
3562.24,3566.24, We've talked about this before the designers I mean some of the best like.
3566.24,3570.24, I agree thing is such a loaded word here so it's a bad deal.
3570.24,3572.24, Right some of the best stories we've heard of.
3572.24,3581.24, Funny things that players have done are from like the wild designers themselves and these guys are like hardcore into their own game too as a game.
3581.24,3583.24, But they'll also still want to do the goofy stuff.
3583.24,3589.24, I mean even the whole hero of Jenkins like meme was is based on what we'd call what would fall under grieving you know right.
3589.24,3591.24, The other thing to is that I think there's it.
3591.24,3602.24, I mean for some people like game is always not real life for me the two are fundamentally different and like my sort of code of ethics is different in games.
3602.24,3603.24, Uh-huh.
3603.24,3610.24," And in the same way that I think like I kind of like jokingly accused this poster of it, but you know like once a while you'll see on the internet about how someone says they were raped in."
3610.24,3611.24, Uh-huh.
3611.24,3615.24," It raves not funny, but they said they were raped in second life and that's funny to me."
3615.24,3616.24, Uh-huh.
3616.24,3621.24, But but very because it's so different you know it's like and they wanted to have a lawsuit and they are having a lawsuit with the same.
3621.24,3624.24, Hoping to have the same conditions as if they had been raped in real life.
3624.24,3627.24, Whereas one is is not funny whatsoever.
3627.24,3633.24, It's fucking ridiculous to me that they think that you got raped in a video game whatever that means.
3633.24,3634.24, I don't even know.
3634.24,3636.24, And they're going to somehow like turn off your vote.
3636.24,3642.24," Yeah, I get the cat lock off what you know social social handling for that like that that's preposterous to me you know."
3642.24,3643.24, Right.
3643.24,3645.24, So I mean some people go so far down the rabbit.
3645.24,3647.24, It's not the same like you shut that part of their brain on.
3647.24,3648.24, Yeah.
3648.24,3649.24," If I'm on a bus, you know."
3649.24,3651.24, And someone's like poking me in the side.
3651.24,3656.24, I don't think that's the same as if I'm like doing the equivalent of poking in the character in an online game.
3656.24,3657.24, Right.
3657.24,3658.24, Right.
3658.24,3659.24, And maybe I'm alone in that.
3659.24,3662.24," But to me, hey, I don't games are not that serious of a business to me."
3662.24,3663.24, So I'm going to do taking a while.
3663.24,3664.24, It starts typing in me.
3664.24,3666.24, I am fondling your breasts.
3666.24,3668.24, I'm not going to consider myself assaulted.
3668.24,3669.24, Right.
3669.24,3670.24, And that's the whole thing.
3670.24,3671.24, So my act of enjoy it.
3671.24,3676.24," That ridiculous like a lot of taking to its extreme would say that like, you know, yeah."
3676.24,3677.24, You just use just ignore the day.
3677.24,3678.24, Yeah.
3678.24,3680.24, I don't really buy the movie analogy.
3680.24,3682.24, And it makes so light of the real thing.
3682.24,3684.24," You know, it's like an insult to."
3684.24,3685.24, Yeah.
3685.24,3686.24, Yeah.
3686.24,3687.24, It's a survivor.
3687.24,3688.24, Yeah.
3688.24,3689.24, Real.
3689.24,3690.24, Yeah.
3690.24,3691.24, Yeah.
3691.24,3692.24, Yeah.
3692.24,3695.24," I'm not sure about like basically like it's like saying, you know, the griefing is like almost like, you know, you have to remove that person from the movie theater."
3695.24,3696.24," I mean, that's just that's absurd."
3696.24,3698.24," I mean, that's not what's happening here."
3698.24,3699.24, Right.
3699.24,3701.24," I mean, and in the movie, it's a one shot thing."
3701.24,3703.24, Would you have no control over.
3703.24,3704.24, Right.
3704.24,3705.24," And it, I mean, your."
3705.24,3706.24, We've been over this.
3706.24,3707.24, Yeah.
3707.24,3708.24, It's just like.
3708.24,3717.24," And even then it might be more like if all of a sudden, so, so and made it so that like, what are the, one of the actors on screen, had like a mustache or something right."
3717.24,3720.24," And like, they're able to like do stuff like that."
3720.24,3721.24, I don't know.
3721.24,3724.24," You know, the only thing, I guess, the only case of griefing where I would take issue with is anything."
3724.24,3727.24, It's going to make me like redo game play for like a couple hours.
3727.24,3732.24," Like say like really, right, Jen, can sing and go through a couple, like go through a raid and then you."
3732.24,3735.24," And then you die and then you got to redo the thing for a couple hours, you know, lose XP."
3735.24,3737.24," But I do still, I still would do that."
3737.24,3745.24," Like, so I guess like, I still won't like if, you know, I was talking about getting a whole bunch of a mob pissed off and then leading that mob to someone who had like an undying rank."
3745.24,3746.24, Right.
3746.24,3748.24, And then that mob often died.
3748.24,3750.24," Like to me, like that's really just fun."
3750.24,3752.24, Like that should happen to me.
3752.24,3755.24, I've totally got griefed and ganked and like the games that I laughed.
3755.24,3756.24, Right.
3756.24,3763.24," But also the hardcore ones, you know, like when we were playing, um, call war as the demo, we found ways to like, because there's,"
3763.24,3768.24," There's so many like like shades of, of creeping, you know, there's like exploiting, which is like something that's there."
3768.24,3772.24," But like, you know, exploiters will draw the line they'll never do anything to the code."
3772.24,3774.24, So they'll never put hack in or something.
3774.24,3786.24," So we found ways to get out of the map, but then there's some straight out hacking like my got style griefers coming in that are like jumping 60 feet near turning like, you know, falling through the floor and shooting us for beneath the map."
3786.24,3788.24, And I was laughing out loud.
3788.24,3789.24," I was like, right."
3789.24,3790.24," I was like, right."
3790.24,3794.24," Like, I mean, just about every single case is totally hilarious and totally cool."
3794.24,3797.24," The only time that I would, I mean, I have never done with this myself."
3797.24,3803.24," But I'm just saying personally, if I invested like hours and hours into something, then I know how to like go back and reinvest hours."
3803.24,3804.24, Now it piss me off to know in.
3804.24,3808.24," Yeah, you know, I'm a little bit worried, but I think it's manned on my,"
3808.24,3813.24," Oh, it's like, oh, but it's like, okay, maybe it's different for me because like I do this for my job."
3813.24,3817.24, And I probably would not be spending hours in the real in my free time.
3817.24,3827.24," It's very, very difficult though, in almost all of the most outside of like what the Brian, you online and ultima online to do to cost anyone serious."
3827.24,3831.24," Because even if you get every, killed and loaded there's like no death penalty."
3831.24,3836.24," Yeah, like, like, like, there it's like, there it's fine, but I just keep thinking of like, you know, like a wow pedal tier."
3836.24,3838.24," So or ever, back in the day, ever quest penalties."
3838.24,3844.24," Yeah, that's very hard for you to play wow on a PvP server, then you kind of have what's coming to you, right?"
3844.24,3846.24," I mean, I was on a PvP server."
3846.24,3852.24," And exactly what you're talking about what happened to me, I would get ganked like ruthlessly in places where I be like,"
3852.24,3854.24," It's like, come on, man, come on already."
3854.24,3855.24, Got it out.
3855.24,3857.24," No, and they do it again and then give a shit."
3857.24,3858.24, Would you like to go over my core?
3858.24,3861.24," But then the thing was like, yeah, it's my own fault."
3861.24,3862.24," Yeah, I joined the server."
3862.24,3863.24," Yeah, right."
3863.24,3864.24, And then you know what?
3864.24,3866.24, Then I did it back to people.
3866.24,3867.24, And that felt good.
3867.24,3868.24, And I felt really good.
3868.24,3869.24," You said, right, right?"
3869.24,3870.24, So you started doing a little one guy.
3870.24,3873.24," When I was watching Ryan play ultima, he was so, I was like, dude, what's that stupid thing,"
3873.24,3876.24," Jason, you on the horse, you're like, oh, it's just another player trying to kill me."
3876.24,3878.24," And I'm like, he's been doing it for 15 minutes."
3878.24,3880.24," Ryan and carries like, I've started going to town."
3880.24,3882.24, I'm going to make it to town.
3882.24,3885.24," No, it's like Wild West."
3886.24,3890.24," Yeah, I mean, I got some people in Wild West, like the follow me and Seth Leeford."
3890.24,3893.24," Like, three minutes hoping like I'll accidentally hit them or something."
3893.24,3895.24," And I'm just like, hey, if that's what you want to do."
3895.24,3897.24, That's how you want to spend your time.
3897.24,3898.24, Yeah.
3898.24,3900.24," I think a larger part of, I mean, it might be a whole other conversation,"
3900.24,3904.24," but I just keep thinking like, Baron, kind of, I'm trying to touch upon this a little."
3904.24,3908.24," I think that a big part of the reason why people, there's so many care bears that"
3908.24,3912.24," take issue with griefing because they, they, they, that's, this is basically the place"
3913.24,3916.24," they can get their RPG fix from like, there's there aren't many classical RPGs anymore,"
3916.24,3917.24, read us play by yourself.
3917.24,3918.24, Yeah.
3918.24,3919.24," So yeah, there's a lot of stuff."
3919.24,3923.24, So they certainly go online looking for that fix and wishing this is something that it doesn't exactly.
3923.24,3924.24, Exactly.
3924.24,3928.24," But yeah, I mean, I, for me, I can't, I can't really draw online."
3928.24,3930.24, Like everything's 30 and pretty much.
3930.24,3931.24, I think so too.
3931.24,3934.24," Yeah, I mean, the time said that I've been on and people have done goofy shit to me."
3934.24,3937.24," I mean, obviously just like, okay, yeah, you got me."
3937.24,3938.24," Yeah, whatever."
3938.24,3941.24," And you know, if I really bothers me, I just log off and come back when they're gone."
3941.24,3942.24, That's it.
3942.24,3945.24, I play on PDP servers and I get my ass kicked and I laugh about it.
3945.24,3950.24," Like it's been some pretty creative like, you know, hateful moments, but I knew it was coming."
3950.24,3952.24," I walked out, I walked out into his own."
3952.24,3953.24, I shouldn't have been in.
3953.24,3957.24," I feel like it's sort of like if it's, I don't know, it's hard to say."
3957.24,3959.24," It's a, it's a real subjective call here."
3959.24,3962.24," You know, I think at some level, like, I just like,"
3962.24,3966.24," pranks, you know, like it, it did pranks all my life."
3966.24,3968.24," Yeah, remember when we, when we had,"
3969.24,3972.24, remember when I was a rockstar's bully came out.
3972.24,3976.24," I think it was Joe Rebekye, over at OPM, started to thread about or somebody at one."
3976.24,3982.24," Sharky started to thread about hey, send us your anecdotal bully source about when you were a bully."
3982.24,3985.24, And I wrote one about like how I had been bullied.
3985.24,3990.24, And then John Elliott sent out the female that was like 50 examples of all the different bullying.
3990.24,3996.24," It was like, no, it was like, no, it was just, just, just, just, just like, one example to give this words,"
3996.24,4003.24," repeating online. Yeah, but because it's like, you get to, the games are a good outlet because like once you can't do that anymore because you'll get busted."
4003.24,4005.24, You were just getting arrested or stuck.
4005.24,4006.24, You could do it in a game.
4006.24,4013.24, But like we would take like pair of tidy ideas and then you spray up the crotch with butter spray.
4013.24,4016.24, Drill a few dots of Tabasco in there.
4016.24,4020.24, And then you take like a nutty peanut butter with a lot of nuts in it.
4020.24,4022.24, You fix it with her. She's in an egg yolk.
4022.24,4023.24, And then you roll that together.
4024.24,4025.24," And it's like, you roll that together."
4025.24,4027.24," And it's like, you roll that together."
4027.24,4030.24," And it's like, like, the perfect, the perfect, you know, sauce."
4030.24,4032.24," It's just like, it's solid, but it's greasy."
4032.24,4037.24," And then you dribble that all inside inside the, you know, the crotch."
4037.24,4039.24, And then you take those bad dads.
4039.24,4041.24," And like, we, we made tons of those."
4041.24,4043.24," It was like, you know, making all these drawers."
4043.24,4045.24, And then we leave them like in the safe way.
4045.24,4048.24," Don't, in case all laid out like it was a display."
4048.24,4051.24," Like, that's, you know, working there at the time?"
4051.24,4052.24," No, it was after I'll fit."
4053.24,4055.24, I did it like a week after I've had a week after I quit.
4055.24,4058.24," You ever tried to, you know, try to, I'll try to, I'll end by any chance."
4058.24,4065.24," But then other uses we took, we took the same taking role in drawers and like epoxy them up over the school lunch lines."
4065.24,4068.24," Like, we're, you know, the cafeteria lines."
4068.24,4071.24," And then like epoxy one on a stop sign, which is so rad."
4071.24,4077.24," Because like, I remember years later, people would say like the, in the town, you know, where I graduated high school like that,"
4077.24,4080.24, that still like elastic BBD band on the stop sign is.
4081.24,4083.24," And then the best one, we'll not the best."
4083.24,4091.24," It's the safe way was the best, but then like, of course, the Danny's bathroom, you just like rub some toilet paper in the mess and have it draping over the toilet and leave that in there."
4091.24,4093.24, And then stuff like that.
4093.24,4098.24," But yeah, so it was like, you just graduate from doing that to talking about grandma in the rapture."
4098.24,4103.24," We should put that formula up on the, on the, on the, on the blog post here, your BVD recipe."
4103.24,4106.24," Sorry, on the podcast, man."
4107.24,4108.24, You need the exact ratio.
4108.24,4109.24, Yeah.
4109.24,4110.24, Yeah. I encourage you.
4110.24,4111.24, You're going to insight.
4111.24,4112.24, That's a lot of stuff.
4112.24,4114.24," It's so, it's a lot of stuff."
4114.24,4116.24, Please don't do that at home or at your school.
4116.24,4117.24, Don't do it.
4117.24,4118.24, Right. Don't do it.
4118.24,4122.24," But I just will say, it looks so real. Like, you'll, you'll be impressed with even taste real through on hand."
4122.24,4124.24," You work, but don't do it."
4124.24,4125.24, Don't want to do it.
4125.24,4126.24, Don't be like shows.
4126.24,4129.24," Stunts were performed on clothes, safe ways."
4129.24,4131.24, I was speaking about this.
4131.24,4133.24, Is anybody here going to play the jackass video game?
4133.24,4135.24, What the hell?
4135.24,4137.24, I know of his existence.
4137.24,4139.24, It's a little late coming.
4139.24,4140.24, Yeah.
4140.24,4147.24," What I would use like, say, I got to hang out with both Steve O and BAM Margari and Margari and Margari and various points."
4147.24,4148.24," Oh, yeah."
4148.24,4151.24," And I remember they were like, yeah, we wanted to do a jackass game."
4151.24,4153.24, It was like years and years ago.
4153.24,4155.24," And it seemed like, yeah, it's kind of over isn't it?"
4155.24,4156.24, Yeah.
4156.24,4159.24," I mean, like the jackass team movie came out with great stuff, but it's like, yeah."
4159.24,4160.24, They needed to have done it.
4160.24,4164.24, Like before even the Tony hot games got us played out as they are now.
4164.24,4165.24, Yeah.
4165.24,4168.24," Well, now they're already making one for the console thing."
4168.24,4170.24," And it's just be stupid too, I think."
4170.24,4180.24, And it's like what like you get less stage pranks in a video game or pretend they're doing like like a dude like the whole essence of jackass is funny because you don't know like it's the y'all might have surprised.
4180.24,4184.24, You need like a totally emerging like emerging simulated universe to play in.
4184.24,4187.24, Like for people like real reactions to crazy.
4187.24,4188.24," Yeah, you just think."
4188.24,4190.24," Like you go into second life and do your own like,"
4190.24,4198.24," yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my friend went went over the red light district in second life and he had he bought some other scooter that he got somehow."
4198.24,4204.24, So he's flying around and then he started raining like penis prostheses down on the town.
4204.24,4206.24, He did so many.
4206.24,4211.24, It was like lagging the hell out of the server because it was having to calculate the physics.
4211.24,4212.24," You know, the falling."
4212.24,4215.24," Wow, that make like for a second life in his paper."
4215.24,4216.24, It's raining.
4217.24,4220.24, There's an article about someone doing it.
4220.24,4221.24, I don't know if it wasn't exactly the same.
4221.24,4224.24, There's like a author having like a virtual book signing.
4224.24,4226.24," Yeah, and then like, does someone ever get flying that through?"
4226.24,4228.24, That was like the funniest thing ever.
4228.24,4234.24," Someone, someone, some real life, no real life author or whatever was having like some book signing or speech in the game."
4234.24,4235.24, Okay.
4235.24,4240.24," And someone like grieved that and like made this these giant fowluses that were like, we're going to make it."
4240.24,4241.24, We're going to make it.
4242.24,4248.24, Rolling all through the thing and then they had music playing in shit unless that was added like post production in YouTube.
4248.24,4251.24," But it's like, you know, so right right in the walk, these are some kind of shit."
4251.24,4252.24, Yeah.
4252.24,4254.24," Well, that is kind of a jackass moment."
4254.24,4256.24," Yeah, that's totally like what the first guy's going to do."
4256.24,4259.24, And how you're going to do that and something other than like a second life scenario.
4259.24,4260.24," Yeah, you can."
4260.24,4261.24, Yeah.
4261.24,4262.24, But good luck.
4262.24,4265.24," Yeah, taking a shopping cart down a hill and crashing in a video game."
4265.24,4268.24, That's about taking a shot of a cart down a hill and crashing through the dome.
4268.24,4274.24, You don't that's like probably more fun to get a word hog and take it off a man cannon when you have your teammates in it and ram.
4274.24,4279.24, Unless it's something like way more complicated than assuming it is.
4279.24,4282.24, It's an MMO nothing in the shows or movies make sense in a game.
4282.24,4283.24," No, I just can't separate it."

4369.24,4370.24, Yeah.
4370.24,4371.24, Anyway.
4371.24,4375.24, So what we're waiting for the time to pass.
4375.24,4377.24, That's a good reason.
4377.24,4378.24, We could stop.
4378.24,4380.24, We could stop if you wanted to add anything.
4380.24,4386.24, Today's whiskey nerd intro was about an excursion to a game store.
4386.24,4388.24," Yeah, we have a especially shop."
4388.24,4391.24, Those of us in the podcast haven't heard the whiskey nerd.
4391.24,4392.24," Oh, no."
4392.24,4393.24," Yeah, we're listening."
4393.24,4394.24, As I've heard it before we have.
4394.24,4396.24, So he went to a game store.
4396.24,4397.24, Yeah.
4397.24,4399.24, You went to a game store.
4399.24,4400.24, Yeah.
4400.24,4401.24, You had a good time in there.
4401.24,4402.24," Oh, yeah."
4402.24,4403.24, Yeah.
4403.24,4404.24, I'm glad whiskey nerd is back.
4404.24,4405.24, I'm just kidding.
4405.24,4406.24, But if you got actually.
4406.24,4407.24, Yeah.
4407.24,4409.24, Now I got to remember what it was because I did over the weekend.
4409.24,4410.24, I went to a couple of game stores.
4410.24,4412.24, I was thinking I had like a member of those arrows.
4412.24,4414.24," Like, hey, this is a podcast material."
4414.24,4416.24, The experience is horrible both times.
4416.24,4418.24, I think it was just as I was browsing.
4418.24,4421.24," Like, I heard the clerk say pre order like 50 times."
4421.24,4422.24, Don't kid it.
4422.24,4423.24, I got it.
4423.24,4424.24, It was 20 times.
4424.24,4425.24, Just talking to other people.
4425.24,4426.24, They badger you know.
4426.24,4428.24, It's just it's just like you want to buy anything.
4428.24,4429.24, And it's do you want to pre order it?
4429.24,4430.24, You want to pre order this or that?
4430.24,4431.24," Oh, yeah."
4431.24,4432.24, I asked if something was in.
4432.24,4433.24, And then they said no.
4433.24,4434.24," And I was like, OK."
4434.24,4435.24, Thanks.
4435.24,4437.24," I got, you know, that's basically a big deal."
4437.24,4440.24," So we're hearing over and over again, you know, no matter what."
4440.24,4442.24," If we're not anything up, you're not going to get it."
4442.24,4443.24, If you don't pre order for me.
4443.24,4444.24," He was like, OK."
4444.24,4445.24, I think I will.
4445.24,4446.24, It'll be fine.
4446.24,4447.24, That then it gets us the new thing.
4447.24,4448.24, That's what they do.
4448.24,4449.24, That's what they for.
4449.24,4450.24, And we're saying.
4450.24,4453.24," I was hoping to see, you know, the PC section is is."
4453.24,4455.24," Retro does always, you know, hoping to see."
4455.24,4457.24, Although it targets is actually pretty nice.
4457.24,4459.24, I did go there too and look at their game stuff.
4459.24,4461.24," There, their PC selection is pretty nice."
4461.24,4462.24, And it's the actual attention.
4462.24,4463.24, That's kind of good.
4463.24,4466.24," Um, but we've had the game store."
4466.24,4468.24, I tried to buy a Wii a couple times at the game store.
4468.24,4470.24, That's what I was looking for.
4470.24,4471.24, Yeah.
4471.24,4472.24, Was I always been in have a day in a play?
4472.24,4474.24, I just got the naman.
4474.24,4475.24, Yeah.
4475.24,4476.24, I did the same.
4476.24,4480.24, It was funny because like I started calling at least three times a week.
4480.24,4483.24, And I would do it in a different voice every time because that feels dumb.
4483.24,4485.24, And it was funny because I saw a panier cake.
4485.24,4486.24, I posted the same thing.
4486.24,4487.24," I swear guys, I'm not biting your shit."
4487.24,4488.24, I would do that.
4488.24,4489.24," Like, I've been doing that for a year."
4489.24,4490.24," You know, not a year."
4490.24,4491.24, Yeah.
4491.24,4492.24, No member.
4492.24,4493.24," And I was like, all right, what am I going to say now?"
4493.24,4495.24," Because I don't want to be like, hey, you guys get to meet yet."
4495.24,4497.24, And you want to get off the phone quick.
4497.24,4501.24," And they start telling you, like, you got to come down at 5 a.m. on Friday or something."
4501.24,4502.24," And like, which."
4502.24,4503.24, Yeah.
4503.24,4504.24," Well, let's get a pre-order to the hell out of something."
4504.24,4507.24, But they won't let you like put money down on a Wii when it's going to be.
4507.24,4509.24," I've got to be in like, it's got to be, you know, what's the, give me a year."
4509.24,4514.24," 1994 in a former Soviet Union in a breadliner, a balloony line or something."
4514.24,4517.24, We got to get up at 5 a.m. and wait for some shit.
4517.24,4518.24, I know.
4518.24,4519.24, I'm not doing that.
4519.24,4521.24, I know the guy started giving me tips just to when I should show up.
4521.24,4524.24," And I'm like, you know what, I'm not going to try that hard."
4524.24,4525.24, Right.
4525.24,4527.24," You know, when I, when I get one, I'll get one."
4527.24,4528.24," You know, don't need it that bad."
4528.24,4530.24, When go look at the games.
4530.24,4531.24, Right.
4531.24,4532.24, Yep.
4532.24,4534.24," Go as soon as you, as soon as you're there and you're like, I got to have one."
4534.24,4535.24, I did keep it and check.
4535.24,4536.24, Go look at the games for it.
4536.24,4538.24," And then you're like, man, I don't."
4538.24,4539.24, Yeah.
4539.24,4540.24, Yeah.
4540.24,4541.24," And I, I was pissed three."
4541.24,4543.24, I was really thinking about getting it this weekend to play Warhol.
4543.24,4544.24, And I go and I looked at the games.
4544.24,4547.24," And it was like now coming soon, pre-order Rainbow Six Vegas."
4548.24,4549.24, I did the same exact thing.
4549.24,4551.24," I had a target of like, hey, PS3, I should get one."
4551.24,4554.24," No, then soon as I looked at the games, there's nothing."
4554.24,4555.24, Right.
4555.24,4556.24, I guess I tried to get this.
4556.24,4557.24, There's just one of play motorstorm.
4557.24,4558.24, That's it.
4558.24,4559.24," And it, you know, virtual fire."
4559.24,4560.24, It's all potential energy right.
4560.24,4561.24, Yeah.
4561.24,4565.24," I mean, even the Wii is like, I haven't played a thing on it since like Zelda."
4565.24,4567.24, The locationally break out the Wii sports when people come over.
4567.24,4569.24, But that's the reason I could get one.
4569.24,4571.24," It's, it would just be for the family."
4571.24,4573.24," It's very, very, very, very."
4573.24,4575.24," People are like, so why are you, my plans to get that."
4575.24,4576.24, Where are you where?
4576.24,4577.24, Where are we?
4577.24,4579.24, We're out off even faster than sports.
4579.24,4580.24, Really?
4580.24,4581.24, Really.
4581.24,4582.24, That's not good.
4582.24,4583.24, I thought it was all right.
4583.24,4584.24, It's good.
4584.24,4586.24," It just, we stopped carrying really fast."
4586.24,4588.24," It's really just, I mean, and this is come up on board recently."
4588.24,4591.24, It's really about game selection at this point.
4591.24,4592.24," Yeah, it's not a game."
4592.24,4593.24, It's not a game.
4593.24,4594.24," No, not a game at all."
4594.24,4596.24, But there's just some sad-ass games for it.
4596.24,4599.24," You know, and everyone's like, if you see a pitch and online all the time,"
4599.24,4602.24," you know, it's one of yours, the way that they handle Wii when they talk about it."
4602.24,4609.24," Because they don't talk enough about, you know, smash brothers, Metroid Prime and Mario, they're all supposed to be coming out the end of this year."
4609.24,4612.24," But it's like, I'm looking for the instant graph, Kation of a bite now."
4612.24,4614.24," I'm not going to be like, oh, well, this is good."
4614.24,4617.24," I know that I'm all set come, you know, November or something."
4617.24,4618.24, I want to place them shit now.
4618.24,4619.24, Yeah.
4619.24,4620.24," It's like they're going to be like, why the time?"
4620.24,4621.24, Why this?
4621.24,4622.24, Just some corny ass games on that system.
4622.24,4625.24," And it is a real worry that like, it's, it's what happened with GameCube."
4625.24,4628.24," Nintendo puts out excellent, excellent first party games."
4628.24,4631.24," But then if it's not Nintendo product, and if it's not like real game,"
4631.24,4634.24," and if it's not like related to them, you know, like when Silicon Knights did, you know,"
4634.24,4637.24," Melgure, it's like fucking W. W. Crush Hour."
4637.24,4638.24, Yep.
4638.24,4639.24, It's all every other baby game that you can.
4639.24,4644.24," But still some of the, some of the games I had on GameCube were some of the best games I've played,"
4644.24,4645.24," you know, in a long time."
4645.24,4646.24," Oh, yeah. Totally."
4646.24,4649.24," Like, first paper Mario was my favorite RPG of that year on any,"
4649.24,4652.24," oh, that's the, that's another one I'd get for it."
4652.24,4653.24," The super, paper Mario."
4653.24,4654.24, I do have that.
4654.24,4655.24, I haven't played very much for it.
4655.24,4657.24, I've played like the first world.
4657.24,4658.24, It's really talking.
4658.24,4660.24," Everyone's right when they say it's like, oh, my God,"
4660.24,4663.24, I've been going to get past all the freaking like chatter.
4663.24,4666.24, So do we need to edit out the last 10 minutes of podcast?
4666.24,4667.24," No, this is the bonus."
4667.24,4668.24, This is our bonus.
4668.24,4669.24," Well, it's a long time."
4669.24,4670.24, Bonus console material.
4670.24,4671.24, Yeah.
4671.24,4672.24, We say that we saved the random crap.
4672.24,4673.24, Yeah.
4673.24,4675.24, We wouldn't have had the last talk at the end of the last one.
4675.24,4677.24," No, you wouldn't have talked about it."
4677.24,4679.24," I also want to say that you're getting nerdy, like shit."
4679.24,4680.24," Every day, right?"
4680.24,4685.24, We're talking about comic books and I've been trying to get you to read a certain list of comic books.
4685.24,4686.24, Yeah.
4686.24,4687.24, I don't know.
4687.24,4688.24, I don't know.
4688.24,4691.24," In fact, comic snob, you know, I don't really think my read comic books."
4691.24,4692.24, Yeah.
4692.24,4694.24, I've never had you read superhero stuff.
4694.24,4698.24," Only like three powers, which is like, oh, is that still going?"
