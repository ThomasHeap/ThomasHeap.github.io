0.0,8.0, Hello and welcome once again to the CGW Radio podcast. This is the podcast where July 17th 2006.
8.0,13.0, I'm going to try something new today and I'm going to say what we're talking about first.
13.0,18.0," So if you don't like these topics after Sam, you can just leave and we'll just talk anyway."
18.0,20.0, Sounds like a great idea.
20.0,22.0, I was kind of hostile.
22.0,23.0, It's just cool here.
23.0,27.0," Today we're going to do our little round of what you plan first, get that out of the way."
27.0,32.0, Then a few of the editors here spent day last Friday was at Thursday.
32.0,35.0," There's an electronic arts, EA's."
35.0,43.0," There are big summer showcase, extrapaganza showing all their new stuff with at least one big exciting announcement there that we'll talk about."
43.0,48.0, Then Darren are our news.
48.0,52.0," What, what, I was going to say like, no's hound. That's not a work."
52.0,56.0, Darren's going to give us the news for the week and we will make fun of him while doing so.
56.0,59.0, And then we're going to answer some of your reader mail.
59.0,66.0, So that's the plan. We'll see if we stick to it and helping me today are among the following people.
66.0,67.0, Brian Scott.
67.0,68.0, Darren Gladstone.
68.0,69.0, Sean Elliott.
69.0,70.0, And Sean Maloy.
70.0,77.0," And since you can't see us in person, you all should know that today, Ryan is sporting one of my favorite"
77.0,80.0, shirts of his.
80.0,81.0, I'll take a screenshot of it.
81.0,82.0, We'll take a screenshot of it.
82.0,84.0," Tell us what your shirt says, Ryan."
84.0,87.0," My shirt says, this is what cool looks like in the second."
87.0,88.0, In the second.
88.0,90.0, That is what cool looks like.
90.0,91.0, Ryan Scott.
91.0,93.0, Good to see.
93.0,96.0, I don't think any of the rest of us could actually get away with that shirt.
96.0,100.0, Only Ryan could wear that because I already used just so deep.
100.0,102.0, Oh yeah.
102.0,104.0, That was a compliment.
104.0,105.0, I met that in a good way.
105.0,106.0, Yeah.
106.0,108.0, So we're a little busy today.
108.0,109.0, You all should know.
109.0,111.0, We're going to do a regular long podcast.
111.0,116.0, But I want you to know just because I'm a little resentful that we're sitting here doing this.
116.0,117.0," Oh, I'm making noises."
117.0,119.0, I'm making noises with the prey lighter.
119.0,122.0, We got prey as seen in the ultimate as seen in the game.
122.0,123.0, Yeah.
123.0,128.0," Your character has a lighter and certain, certain exalted editors, I guess, got prey"
128.0,129.0, lighter.
129.0,130.0, You only I got one.
130.0,131.0, I think you did.
131.0,132.0, Yeah.
132.0,134.0," So as you walk on the dark corridor as of CGW, you can you can light that up."
134.0,137.0," Conveniently enough, I'm doing the review too."
137.0,141.0, And we all know that free lighters equals one star extra at least.
141.0,144.0, It's really a shame we're not doing star sports anymore.
144.0,145.0, Yeah.
145.0,148.0," If we were and you saw that I gave it for you and no really it was the game was a three,"
148.0,150.0, but the lighter was a one.
150.0,152.0, That's a really loving effort at the score.
152.0,155.0, So we could get this stuff.
155.0,156.0, Okay.
156.0,159.0, So what I was saying was this is actually our deadline week.
159.0,160.0, So we're pretty busy.
160.0,162.0, We're trying to put out a magazine right now.
162.0,164.0, We're trying to show up the September issue.
164.0,165.0, Sorry.
165.0,166.0, Yep.
166.0,168.0, September here in mid July.
168.0,173.0," And you know, so what I'm saying is I want you to appreciate us."
173.0,174.0, Okay.
174.0,176.0, We're doing this for you.
176.0,178.0, All right.
178.0,179.0," So what do you, what do you guys playing?"
179.0,180.0, What are you playing Ryan?
180.0,181.0," You're not playing Guild Wars, are you?"
181.0,183.0, I'm not playing Guild Wars right now.
183.0,187.0, I've taken a break from Guild Wars to play an in-em-o that actually really
187.0,190.0, good and doesn't get the attention it deserves.
190.0,192.0, It's even online.
192.0,196.0, And it's sort of a it's a sci-fi and memo.
196.0,197.0, Came out of Europe.
197.0,199.0, Most of its player bases European.
199.0,204.0," I think they've got somewhere around 125,000 total players."
204.0,205.0, Or so.
205.0,209.0," So not only do you have to play with other people, but you have to play with the European people."
209.0,210.0, Yeah.
210.0,212.0, That's a double turn off for me right there.
212.0,213.0, Wow.
213.0,216.0, So that's the guy with the French wife.
217.0,220.0, People speaking mostly are typing mostly English on it.
220.0,221.0, There is a dog.
221.0,223.0," Oh, it's like an English speaking."
223.0,225.0, So you're not getting a German chat.
225.0,229.0," No, I think they just put up a server specifically for China."
229.0,230.0, Mm-hmm.
230.0,233.0, But the rest of the world plays on like this one.
233.0,235.0, One server.
235.0,239.0, And it's kind of a pretty hardcore MMO.
239.0,244.0," You know, there's free PvP, you know, anybody can just run up and kill you if you're."
244.0,246.0, It's all PvP.
246.0,248.0," Well, if you're there, there's certain like."
248.0,253.0, Unsick your areas where you can you can kill by other players if you're not careful.
253.0,257.0, And that all the economy and everything is player controlled.
257.0,259.0, Um.
259.0,262.0, That's the one where you can like.
262.0,265.0, Log off for a month and like level up while you're not even playing.
265.0,268.0," Yeah, it has like this interesting skill system where it's awesome."
268.0,270.0," I mean, the whole game here."
270.0,272.0, I'd be the most lead player.
272.0,274.0, You're probably a shot of a shot of a shot of a fauna sleep over there.
274.0,276.0," Wake up, dude."
276.0,278.0, You're a fucking hot in mind.
278.0,280.0, You're a penis.
280.0,281.0, Up the gym.
281.0,282.0, Pump it up.
282.0,286.0," Look at the shitty bang bang stuff in a minute, Sean."
286.0,288.0," Well, you played whole game."
288.0,289.0, It's all in outer space.
289.0,292.0, So you never you never like set foot on a planet or go out.
292.0,293.0, It's all space.
293.0,296.0," Yeah, so there aren't any orcs and elves in this game."
296.0,298.0, Are you like you're trying to be on a spaceship?
298.0,301.0," There's like, third guards that are like reading the skin dayly."
301.0,304.0, It's like what's the answer to the point of yours and there's like.
304.0,305.0, But they're not elves.
305.0,307.0, Are there any space where it's?
307.0,311.0," No, no, there's they don't like boats and they don't like dark ours."
311.0,314.0," There's no, all there is is like dude in spaceships."
314.0,316.0, Space pirates and stuff.
316.0,320.0," Isn't this game the one that gets the bad rap though for a side from all the sort of,"
320.0,325.0," in game society stuff that happens, but for just being essentially calculus with the"
325.0,328.0," space screen saber, it's actually."
328.0,332.0," It's it's not well, well, when you first jump in and you you start doing a tutorial."
332.0,335.0, It looks like this really intimidating game.
335.0,337.0, It looks like wallpaper.
337.0,338.0, What is your wall.
338.0,340.0, It looks great.
340.0,342.0, Yeah.
342.0,344.0," So, yeah, I'm sorry."
344.0,346.0, It's the God's of the economy.
346.0,348.0, Gonna rip you off aren't the the gods of industry.
348.0,351.0, Gonna make you their peon and aren't the gods of work.
351.0,354.0, Gonna grind you to the dark our dust.
354.0,355.0, Pretty much.
355.0,356.0, Yeah.
356.0,360.0, So what do you why what made you want to play this and are you going to keep playing?
360.0,361.0, Do you actually like it?
361.0,363.0, I do so far.
363.0,367.0," I've only been playing for since Friday, so I've been playing for about three days now."
367.0,370.0, But it's it's an interesting game.
370.0,374.0, It's it's different than would you recommend it to us?
374.0,376.0, I'd recommend you check it out.
376.0,377.0, I don't know.
377.0,380.0, You guys are all into like the whole wow thing.
380.0,381.0, So yeah.
381.0,383.0, It might be too hard for you.
383.0,385.0, A gold regular people.
385.0,388.0," No, but the skill system like I was going to say,"
388.0,393.0, You have all these skills that you can learn and what you do is you just set a skill.
393.0,397.0," You can learn one skill at a time and you set the skill to start learning and it'll tell you,"
397.0,402.0," You know, the skill will take so it's such a tough hours to get to the next rank."
402.0,403.0, Okay.
403.0,404.0, And it trains in real time.
404.0,407.0," So even if you log off, it's still training."
407.0,409.0, So I'm playing the right now.
409.0,412.0, What is your skill?
413.0,414.0, Every skill.
414.0,415.0, Yeah.
415.0,417.0, And there's like no limit to the number of skills.
417.0,418.0, So will you just level it?
418.0,419.0, Okay.
419.0,421.0, I could just come back in two years and be level 60.
421.0,422.0, Long should paint that month.
422.0,423.0, That'd be awesome.
423.0,424.0, Yeah.
424.0,427.0, So there's no chance you'd ever catch up to like the highest guy in this everything.
427.0,428.0," Oh, yeah."
428.0,430.0, Whoever whoever logged on first is the highest level.
430.0,433.0," Well, the thing there's like there's tons of different skills."
433.0,434.0, Right.
434.0,436.0, You have skills that cover.
436.0,439.0," You really general things like spaceship piloting, you know,"
439.0,447.0," having like different different types of spacecraft and then really my new things like how to use individual missiles like light missiles versus medium missiles, you know,"
447.0,449.0, But each have like their own skill.
449.0,450.0, Mm-hmm.
450.0,458.0," And to get to the highest ranks of a skill, like to go from rank four to rank five, which is which is the highest in any skill."
458.0,460.0, It'll take like I have this one.
460.0,463.0, It's like you'll hit it will take you 20 days.
463.0,468.0," Such and such hours, you know, so it would take me like 20 days to get that one skill to rank five."
468.0,472.0, You actually have to do anything to get to that rank or just be alive.
472.0,474.0," No, you just pay the membership fee."
474.0,475.0, Exactly.
475.0,479.0, So you don't have to use the skill. You just have to you just have to wait for the timer to count down.
479.0,483.0," It's like hiring a powered leveler, but like they just built it right into the game."
483.0,486.0," Well, you can only train one at a time, though."
486.0,489.0, So what's best?
489.0,491.0, When do you actually play the game?
491.0,493.0, Is this when you're logged off?
493.0,495.0," Well, I mean, you know, you're."
496.0,498.0, I'm leveling right down. This is great.
498.0,499.0, It's progress quest.
499.0,502.0, You log in. You can log in and like do stuff while you're.
502.0,506.0," You know, where your the skill is training and skills just always training no matter what you're doing."
506.0,507.0, Okay.
507.0,510.0, So you can run around. You can mine or off Asteroids.
510.0,511.0, Mining or?
511.0,512.0, That's it.
512.0,514.0," You can go and got it. So different from while, though."
514.0,516.0, You can fight like space pirates.
516.0,518.0, I agree with your ship.
518.0,519.0," Wow, it's pirates."
519.0,520.0, Yeah.
520.0,522.0," It doesn't have space pirates, too."
522.0,523.0, But we have an inches.
523.0,524.0, No.
525.0,526.0, I don't need to use.
526.0,528.0, I wish we shouldn't be harsh on this game.
528.0,529.0, You're the only one who played it.
529.0,531.0, Can't say you're making the greatest case for it.
531.0,534.0," Well, we all know it today."
534.0,535.0, Good things about it.
535.0,537.0," We've already had the best stuff about it, too, though."
537.0,538.0, Yeah.
538.0,542.0," So I mean, it's I kind of get the feeling so far that I might."
542.0,547.0," I might run out of stuff to do other than so far all I've seen is like,"
547.0,549.0," Well, the great thing is you'll be leveling anyway."
549.0,550.0, Yeah.
550.0,551.0, Career missions.
551.0,552.0, And just one way to make it.
552.0,555.0, And my people keep their subscriptions active.
555.0,558.0," It's like, well, if I don't want to play, maybe in a year, I'll be so awesome."
558.0,560.0, That's how we start.
560.0,561.0, Yeah.
561.0,564.0, All the interesting stuff I've read about sounds like it's the player to play
564.0,567.0, social action stuff and creating the fun gameplay.
567.0,569.0," Basically putting hits out on one another,"
569.0,573.0, getting them all inside their faction and then basically making a pull-in-off
573.0,574.0, a heist and all that sort of thing.
574.0,576.0," When I heard it was like, right, merciless getting started, like,"
576.0,578.0," you know, you can just put a newbie area, you know,"
578.0,581.0, keep pirates just kind of like laying in weight for you to like show up.
581.0,582.0, Right.
582.0,585.0," That's kind of like any, you know, MMO with PvP that, right?"
585.0,586.0, As soon as you get into it.
586.0,589.0, But even more so there was just like basically it's like kind of like
589.0,591.0," waiting for you to come out like just peek your head out of that,"
591.0,593.0, like say for each and then you're dead instantly.
593.0,594.0, Yeah.
594.0,595.0, I would do that.
595.0,598.0, I've been avoiding all that stuff for now.
598.0,600.0, Welcome to PvP.
600.0,602.0, And pretty much.
603.0,608.0, Who also has been playing anything different games?
608.0,609.0, What are games?
609.0,610.0, No actually.
610.0,611.0, The here's okay.
611.0,614.0," My confession, I guess, is this weekend I wanted to play a battle for"
614.0,618.0, Middler to finally had a chance to play it and do I play it on the PC?
618.0,620.0, Or do I play the Xbox 360 version?
620.0,621.0, So I give me a break.
621.0,622.0, That's not even a question.
622.0,623.0, I actually was curious.
623.0,624.0, I tried it out.
624.0,625.0, I was genuinely curious.
625.0,626.0," Well, it's out of sheer laziness."
626.0,628.0, I got a nice big TV and a big TV.
628.0,630.0, You can't see anything.
630.0,631.0, You can't tell what's what.
631.0,632.0, Is that enough for Zedor?
632.0,637.0, Let's just drag the slow ass D pad on it and find out.
637.0,639.0," Sadly, I could see everything."
639.0,641.0, Javanagedeans moving nice and slow.
641.0,643.0," Yeah, moving slow."
643.0,644.0," Yeah, I mean, I mean, it looked okay."
644.0,647.0," I mean, it's obviously not, but I mean, I have a nice big HD TV."
647.0,648.0, How big is that TV?
648.0,649.0, 52 inches.
649.0,650.0, Okay.
650.0,652.0, So I actually downloaded the demo.
652.0,654.0, I'm taking a try and I'll just cause I'm curious too.
654.0,655.0," And I have, I don't have an HD."
655.0,656.0, It's like 31 inches.
656.0,657.0," So you're like, squinting you?"
657.0,658.0, I couldn't tell what was going on.
658.0,660.0," I mean, I think it's one of those cases where you really"
660.0,661.0, do need a large TV.
661.0,664.0, Just so you can see all the menu systems and all the things going on.
664.0,665.0, That's true.
665.0,666.0, More and more for 360 games.
666.0,668.0, So it's like I tried to go to a street called street.
668.0,670.0, That's going to be the guy damn instructions.
670.0,671.0, What am I supposed to do?
671.0,674.0, Go on a PC.
674.0,677.0, It looked like it was Eve online text coming at me.
677.0,679.0, So you knew speed.
679.0,680.0, How was the game?
680.0,681.0, The game?
681.0,683.0," I mean, it's the same game for more or less."
683.0,686.0," Isn't it like slow ass gameplay, like clicking on everything with your."
686.0,687.0," Well, they do have the cursor."
687.0,691.0, They do create shortcuts and you can control that you can like amp up the cursor speed.
691.0,694.0," So I mean, it's not like you're, it's not like you're totally hose."
694.0,695.0," I mean, it does do it."
695.0,698.0, It does with a decent job of replacing the keyboard mouse.
698.0,701.0," But at the same point, I'm just, I'm just so bored and bored for it."
701.0,702.0, Like I'm used to the hot keys.
702.0,704.0, I'm used to be able to draw and drag a box around.
704.0,708.0, I just can't even imagine really playing a game of that style and that speed.
708.0,709.0, You know what?
709.0,714.0," In that setting, like on TV on the couch, that seems way more to sort of like a desk keyboard."
714.0,716.0, It's totally like a boss mode of type game.
716.0,721.0," Where you get all up in there and I like, oh, I need to generate 14 or over whatever."
721.0,722.0, Whatever.
722.0,726.0, There's no need to outweigh our foundry.
726.0,728.0, But you need to do that at your desk.
728.0,729.0," Yeah, you do that's on the start."
729.0,731.0," You know, like, all hunched up in there."
731.0,732.0, I got you like face it.
732.0,735.0, That was a beer in your wife or girlfriend hanging around.
735.0,737.0," Who might as well as remembering though is that, you know,"
737.0,739.0, it's not like as the first time this is happened.
739.0,742.0," I mean, everyone, back six, six, six, five or six years ago,"
742.0,745.0, they tried to bring in command and conquer and start craft the year 64.
745.0,746.0, Right.
746.0,750.0," And I mean, that was certainly, that was a much less Starcraft 64."
750.0,753.0," Yeah, but I mean, those were those were decent efforts for what they're trying to do."
753.0,756.0," But I mean, I think the significant thing here is that this really is really,"
756.0,758.0, it looks really close to what the PC version was.
758.0,763.0," Obviously not as high res, but it controls okay, but ultimately at the end of the day."
763.0,766.0," I'm kind of starting to like, like a fighting game."
766.0,769.0," I mean, it's playing so caliber with the keyboard and the mouse itself."
769.0,770.0, Exactly.
770.0,771.0," You know, it's like, right."
771.0,773.0, Certain games can make this happen.
773.0,774.0," It's like, it's like, right."
774.0,775.0, Yeah.
775.0,777.0," Well, I'm willing to bet that just looking to maximize profit, like, you know,"
777.0,780.0," because, you know, command and conquer three is going to come along and they're going to say,"
780.0,783.0, maybe we can bring this over to the 360 as well.
783.0,784.0, Right.
784.0,785.0," It's probably a test run for that, right?"
785.0,787.0," Yeah, though, though I want to do that."
787.0,789.0," Well, that piece of art of them."
789.0,790.0, I guess.
790.0,791.0, I guess.
791.0,796.0, I always wonder if just bring us knowing that it's a time with two forms of design in such a way
796.0,799.0," that like, you're going to get the caped PC version."
799.0,800.0, Yeah.
800.0,801.0, That's always scary.
802.0,807.0," Like, I would like to play army to, on, kind of getting ahead to the E.A. thing, but they didn't show that,"
807.0,811.0," but that's one of their console games, but it's all co-op and that would be a great game of"
811.0,812.0, plan PC.
812.0,813.0, The controls would work.
813.0,814.0, It could be a blast plan.
814.0,816.0, Because apparently the command command goes to the future.
816.0,817.0, That's a trade.
817.0,820.0, I'll let them put command and conquer on the 360 if they give us the other.
820.0,821.0, Okay.
821.0,822.0, Deal.
822.0,823.0, All right.
823.0,824.0, You speak for the game now.
824.0,825.0, Yeah.
825.0,826.0," I'll do that for you, Sean."
826.0,827.0, Okay.
827.0,830.0, So what is what is a Sean brigade over there playing?
830.0,831.0," Sean, I'm going to play."
831.0,835.0," Just to make the start of it again, get the box copy today."
835.0,837.0, Play it to the end of the demo.
837.0,838.0, I like it a lot.
838.0,841.0, And I like the free lighter.
841.0,843.0," No, I finished it."
843.0,845.0, I really liked it a lot.
845.0,850.0, I'm kind of not understanding the mediocre reviews of that game.
850.0,851.0, Adam Gilly.
851.0,852.0," I was like, what do you want?"
852.0,853.0, I'm still waiting to see the goose though.
853.0,854.0, I don't know.
854.0,858.0, It's already feeling like the fact that I've only put in plain it in an hour.
858.0,861.0," And I called, you know, we're talking about when you come to a stop, you know, it's either"
861.0,864.0, time to spear walk or look at the switch on the roof.
864.0,867.0," And you're saying, I'm already saying that and I've only played it for an hour."
867.0,870.0, And it's not reassuring when you're telling me that's the same the whole game.
870.0,872.0," Well, yeah, kind of is."
872.0,874.0, But they do subtle variations on it.
874.0,876.0, And I just like all the gravity stuff.
876.0,880.0," I mean, I like, you know, it really reminds me in a good way of descent back in the day."
880.0,883.0, I don't recall playing a shooter like this in a long time.
883.0,884.0, Yeah.
884.0,886.0," I mean, I really enjoyed it as well."
886.0,890.0," I guess the thing is like, people are saying, okay, yeah, it's no half life two episode one or whatever."
890.0,895.0," I'm like, you know what, there weren't many puzzles in episode one and the ones that were there were just about as rudimentary using the same."
895.0,897.0," Well, I'm not comparing it to one."
897.0,898.0, I'm not kind of a nod.
898.0,899.0," Well, I'm not saying, I'm not saying you."
899.0,900.0, I'm saying some people out there.
900.0,903.0," So I don't think that I think that this game holds up to half life, too."
903.0,905.0," Frankly, I'm not."
905.0,906.0, I'm not.
906.0,907.0, I'm not.
907.0,909.0, And I'm in for a real treat.
909.0,913.0, But I like trying to figure out the weird gravity puzzle.
913.0,914.0, Like finding the answer to those.
915.0,916.0, I do not just switch and turning right.
916.0,920.0," They get more cold thing is in this environment that looks like, you know,"
920.0,922.0, spink theirs and stuff.
922.0,923.0, I'm right.
923.0,924.0, Yes.
924.0,925.0, Okay.
925.0,926.0," Because I mean, we'll have life two."
926.0,927.0, You got the coast level.
927.0,929.0, You've got next thing you're in a no prospect.
929.0,930.0, I'm going through these out of order.
930.0,931.0, But then you're in.
931.0,932.0, Okay.
932.0,933.0, Haunted house land in Ravenholm.
933.0,934.0, Then you're in an alien city.
934.0,935.0, There's no way near.
935.0,937.0, There's a variety.
937.0,942.0," There's no, no, the graphic, you know, it looks just like Quake for and doom three."
942.0,943.0," Yeah, that's all way."
943.0,944.0, I don't know.
944.0,948.0," That's part of the, and the enemies aren't getting any more intelligent, right?"
948.0,950.0, The enemies lurking and play just like.
950.0,951.0, I don't want to go.
951.0,955.0, I had one experience where they actually seem pretty intelligent from the situation for me.
955.0,956.0, I'm just a retard.
956.0,957.0, Yeah.
957.0,958.0, So comparison to you.
958.0,960.0, This goes smart.
960.0,963.0, There's a fire back in me.
963.0,964.0, Shot at me.
964.0,965.0, And I made a way.
965.0,966.0, My shot.
966.0,969.0," I mean, grab just like right where I shot him."
970.0,976.0," Well, no, actually, this one situation I forget which, which creature it was, but we're, you know, we're having a shoot out and there's a health station nearby."
976.0,979.0, And he's hurt and he knows where it is.
979.0,981.0," He, you know, he has, you know, presence of the of mine in the room."
981.0,983.0, So he runs there and he gets the health.
983.0,987.0," He heals him, you know, you know, you know, what a food is accidentally jerk it out though."
987.0,988.0, It did it repeat.
988.0,989.0, That's the key.
989.0,990.0, If it's repeatable.
990.0,995.0," Because he could have been just like he's programmed it like straight left, straight right, straight left."
995.0,996.0," No, he actually."
996.0,997.0, Regardless of what you're doing.
997.0,998.0, And he accidentally ran over that thing.
998.0,1001.0," He actually went out of his way to sign that you like, that was, that was math."
1001.0,1002.0, Did you see it?
1002.0,1003.0, Did you see it?
1003.0,1004.0, Did you see it?
1004.0,1005.0, I was just given your heart.
1005.0,1006.0, No no.
1006.0,1007.0," No, no, actually he actually went through it."
1007.0,1008.0, I told him to leave it.
1008.0,1009.0, Yeah.
1009.0,1011.0," But I mean, but it, but it, but it, but it, but it's a bunch of shots point though."
1011.0,1012.0," I mean, I only saw that once or twice."
1012.0,1014.0, I didn't exactly see it like every single time.
1014.0,1015.0, It was with a specific creature.
1015.0,1017.0, So maybe like they jacked up the intelligence for it.
1017.0,1018.0, I don't know.
1018.0,1019.0, Yeah.
1019.0,1022.0, There are certain things that Half-Life 2 has way over a game like this.
1022.0,1023.0, Yeah.
1023.0,1025.0," Did you find a difficult level because one of the,"
1025.0,1028.0, one of the issues that I'm still struggling with whether I like it or not is the death mechanic.
1028.0,1031.0," Because you, you get killed."
1031.0,1036.0," You kind of go to the spirit world where you're allowed to really shoot the, you know, the health power up, basically."
1036.0,1037.0, Right.
1037.0,1039.0, And then you go right back to where you were.
1039.0,1040.0, It's like a spiritual dot.
1040.0,1041.0, I like it.
1041.0,1043.0, You're a spiritual right.
1043.0,1044.0, I expect a little little dot hunt.
1044.0,1046.0, I expect a little hound to come up and go.
1046.0,1047.0, Yeah.
1047.0,1048.0, Kind of is.
1048.0,1052.0," Except you got the native American, you know, on the good side though, like you were saying,"
1052.0,1055.0, right on their way down here is like you don't have to deal with the loading screen.
1055.0,1056.0, Yeah.
1056.0,1057.0, There's no end game.
1057.0,1058.0, Not reload.
1058.0,1061.0," The only thing I could have on balance though is as you're playing it, you know,"
1061.0,1064.0," you've damaged some like, like a boss guy who kills you."
1064.0,1065.0, Yeah.
1065.0,1068.0," And you come back, you're, you're re-healed and then he's still damaged."
1068.0,1069.0, So right.
1069.0,1070.0, Right.
1070.0,1071.0, Like infinite quarters.
1071.0,1072.0, Yeah.
1072.0,1073.0, Exactly.
1073.0,1074.0, It's like infinite quarters.
1074.0,1075.0, Yeah.
1075.0,1076.0," I mean, you, you basically can't not kill the boss."
1076.0,1079.0," But if no matter how bad you suck, eventually you're just going to wear him down."
1079.0,1080.0, Yeah.
1080.0,1083.0, You're going to the spirit wall and coming back and he'll be down one to come.
1083.0,1084.0, I kind of feels like cheating to me.
1084.0,1088.0," And I guess, I mean, I'm the kind of person who quick saves as much as possible anyway."
1088.0,1089.0, So I'm not sure if.
1089.0,1091.0," Well, you know, that's cheating to."
1091.0,1092.0, Yeah.
1092.0,1093.0, It's the same kind of thing.
1093.0,1095.0," Well, so he kind of keeps you in the game the whole time."
1095.0,1099.0, We need an IMDB style database for games where we track bluepers and stuff.
1099.0,1104.0, Because I'm wondering how Papua who teaches you the ancient secret can't pull off himself.
1104.0,1106.0, Why didn't he come back?
1106.0,1107.0," He didn't have the glow, man."
1107.0,1109.0," Anyway, you got to stay to the end."
1109.0,1110.0," Oh, Papua does pull it on."
1110.0,1111.0, Maybe maybe he does.
1111.0,1112.0, Maybe he does.
1112.0,1113.0, I'm not.
1113.0,1114.0, It's be rude to stay tuned.
1114.0,1115.0, No spoilers.
1115.0,1119.0, I've been playing also team fortress classic this past week.
1119.0,1120.0, Yeah.
1120.0,1124.0," And light of what we'll talk about next, but we wanted to fire it up and did it all that."
1124.0,1125.0, We live the memories.
1125.0,1127.0," You know, it's always fun."
1127.0,1128.0, It's like I know that gave so well.
1128.0,1129.0, I played it so long.
1129.0,1131.0, It's like it never surprises me.
1131.0,1134.0," But all looking at it now saying, OK, here, it's coming."
1134.0,1135.0," You know, it's coming back."
1136.0,1138.0, We found out at the EA event.
1138.0,1141.0," And that was the big, the big hype for me there."
1141.0,1143.0, That the thing is actually real.
1143.0,1144.0, That the sequence actually real.
1144.0,1150.0," But just there's a little, you know, problems where everyone's got to, you know, two grenade varieties in the game."
1150.0,1151.0, It was part of the signature to the thing.
1151.0,1153.0, And then they're specific to each class.
1153.0,1158.0," But because of it, that's a whole lot of grenades to just be thrown out randomly."
1158.0,1160.0," And so if there's, you know, classic map would be two for it."
1160.0,1162.0, It's basically two bases connected by a draw bridge.
1162.0,1164.0," And there's one alternate route underneath the,"
1164.0,1167.0," the water through a tunnel, but basically everyone just goes out."
1167.0,1169.0, Throwes all their grenades on the bridge.
1169.0,1173.0, And anyone trying to play off and just gets blown up without being able to do anything about it.
1173.0,1178.0, Same thing when one of them finally gets over that bridge gets in your base with 40% health.
1178.0,1181.0," Again, he's faced with century guns, full health defenders."
1181.0,1185.0," And everyone just throws their grenades and if friendly fires off, which it almost always is,"
1185.0,1187.0, they're going to get blown up in the splash damage.
1187.0,1189.0, So my worry was.
1189.0,1192.0," How they're going to address that because it's been team portraits,"
1192.0,1196.0," classics always been, at least in my experience playing with clans and stuff."
1196.0,1199.0, Very heavily weighted for defense.
1199.0,1203.0, It's really easy even with just two good soldiers to defend almost any map.
1203.0,1206.0," Whereas an offense takes, you know, a lot of concerted effort on the other."
1206.0,1209.0, So I'm kind of hoping they do something about that.
1209.0,1215.0," But otherwise, it's still so much fun because each class is like wildly different from the next."
1215.0,1220.0," And that far more so than games like battlefield or call do you or something like that,"
1220.0,1222.0, where you're basically just choosing a different gun.
1222.0,1224.0," And again, that's part of the secondary grenade."
1224.0,1230.0, So it's kind of tricky how they worked that out because you want to keep them because they they
1230.0,1233.0," Distinguished your class, but at the same time,"
1233.0,1236.0, little too much too much of it causes problems.
1236.0,1237.0, Yeah.
1237.0,1243.0, It seems like it wasn't that one of the first shooters to do that with the multiple classes and having a really distinct
1243.0,1245.0, difference between them.
1245.0,1246.0, It was definitely one of them.
1246.0,1248.0, If not the first there and you got this.
1248.0,1252.0," I mean, I mean, I'll have to consult a Wikipedia or something like that."
1252.0,1256.0," I mean, and the the rat is part about that is that they're completely unique."
1256.0,1260.0," The stuff you can do with the medics, you know, a lot of the trick grenade jumps."
1260.0,1266.0, The way that the century guns work for the engineers and how it's this always this challenge of finding the most
1266.0,1268.0, opportune place to put it.
1268.0,1273.0," And one that's going to be safe because basically the enemies using a nail gun to take it out and sneak up on it,"
1273.0,1279.0, and then you get the marker nades and stuff and messing with messing around with the maps and finding like the right place to be doing what you want.
1279.0,1284.0," If you're a spy getting on the enemy battle, and it's all though now everyone that's played knows to look for it."
1284.0,1288.0," But you get up there, uh, fain, like you're an enemy sniper and then you play dead."
1288.0,1291.0, And then because usually that area is totally covered with corpses of snipers.
1291.0,1296.0," So they go out and snip you just pop up behind him, stab him and then back and then go down somewhere else."
1296.0,1298.0, But all that stuff is really cool.
1298.0,1308.0, But what was nice to see about you if you haven't seen the image that's up on steam of the new classes is that they went with this whole new art style for it.
1308.0,1311.0," And I think it's great. I mean, that's going to be one of the big."
1311.0,1318.0," I don't know, it's not even such a debate as much as I expected to be, but basically there's like one or two people out there in internet land that say,"
1318.0,1325.0," Well, I wanted the muddy green and brown one that they showed back when at E3, you know, 2002 or whenever it was probably before that even."
1325.0,1339.0," Yeah, probably was. But when you look at it now, the game, since they decided rather than, you know, some speculation said that they were going to do a version of it that took place in half like two continuity, basically, and what's called a seven hour war."
1339.0,1347.0," And since they didn't decide to do that, I think it's an excellent decision to do what they go with the route that they're going because when you look at the art in that game, it's either, I mean,"
1347.0,1359.0," when you look at the gameplay itself, it's just ludicrous. It's two teams in these tiny forts going to capture each other's flags. And if you try to put like a realistic veneer over that, it's just going to emphasize how little sense it makes."
1359.0,1362.0, It's ultimately a game world. So they have a very gamey looking.
1362.0,1366.0, It almost looks like people like the animated action figures.
1366.0,1371.0," Yeah, they do. They look like like vinyl action figures kind of though with a really neat style to them."
1371.0,1375.0," You know, like the same art style that I saw they tried to use and evil genius back in the day."
1375.0,1379.0," It's definitely like a stole from evil genius. Yeah, that's interesting."
1379.0,1386.0, They also look like they're because of the very stylized look that you're going to be able to tell people apart in a glance really easily.
1386.0,1388.0," Yeah, and that's even better."
1388.0,1389.0," I mean, you always could."
1389.0,1394.0," You always could in team fortress class, especially after the second batch of character models that they released."
1394.0,1398.0," But you can. I mean, they're really, they're even more iconic than before."
1398.0,1402.0," I mean, the scouts of skinny little guy with his socks pulled up over his shins."
1403.0,1407.0, So it's everybody looks at Ryan Jeff.
1407.0,1410.0, One day he's just going to kill us.
1410.0,1417.0," The other thing about the art style that's neat is that we have so many shooters and they all look either of the shiny metallic, you know,"
1417.0,1424.0," space aliens, quake and prey style or the battlefield ghost recon military style thing."
1424.0,1426.0," And this definitely gives it, I mean, it's distinct."
1426.0,1431.0," And then even like counter strike and day to feed on source, you know, a lot of source games are starting to look really similar."
1431.0,1439.0, You start recognizing assets that get reused. And so I think it's a great idea. It is something entirely fresh.
1439.0,1440.0, All right.
1440.0,1446.0," So okay. So why don't we officially shift into, I mean, we started talking about that. So that was EA's big announced."
1446.0,1452.0," I guess I was a big one, but you guys spent all day Thursday at EA's summer showcase."
1452.0,1460.0," So they went through their whole big lineup and team fortress two was the big announcement, but were there other good ones that came out of that show or nope."
1460.0,1464.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Talk about portal portal portal portal."
1464.0,1467.0, It's another word for shrink door.
1467.0,1471.0, All right. So everyone's always been talking about the portal. The portal's being used and prey lately.
1471.0,1478.0," And it's kind of cool you walk through one and it's since you don't know how part of the ship or whatever, and messes with your whole sense of reality."
1478.0,1481.0," The thing is, can I just pause for one second? Somebody say this one. Can I say this?"
1481.0,1483.0, Can I say this? Can just hold on.
1484.0,1490.0," Somebody on the on the message board said how or some are said, how is a portal? I need different than just a door."
1490.0,1493.0," You know, support. I mean, Hans pleasure."
1493.0,1496.0, Okay.
1496.0,1497.0, Yeah.
1497.0,1499.0, Because you're just going into it's just linear.
1499.0,1504.0," It's a spink door to, I don't know, it is vorking around in space time."
1504.0,1512.0, I guess the difference to this game is that a door is basically a passageway where you'd expect it.
1512.0,1515.0, And the portal is something that doesn't make sense instead of walking.
1515.0,1516.0, Yeah.
1516.0,1520.0," You end up in another, you know, dropping in another SLS gang."
1520.0,1521.0, Yeah.
1521.0,1522.0, Yeah.
1522.0,1527.0," All right. Anyway. So the whole idea here's basically instead of, instead of walking through the doors,"
1527.0,1529.0," portals that the, they're magic."
1529.0,1530.0, That's a door with magic.
1530.0,1531.0, It's a door with magic.
1531.0,1533.0, A doctor's strange door if you look.
1533.0,1535.0," So as you walk through it, I mean,"
1535.0,1536.0, No magic.
1536.0,1537.0, I'll put the K from the Xman.
1537.0,1539.0, All right. You're killing me here.
1540.0,1542.0, Darren tells about portals.
1542.0,1543.0, Why can't you tell us?
1543.0,1544.0," God, six."
1544.0,1548.0," So the idea is in portal, you actually create the portal."
1548.0,1550.0, So you set the start point in the end point.
1550.0,1554.0," So you can like, you could, you could drop a portal underneath the machine gun,"
1554.0,1556.0," uh, turn it and then put it in the ceiling above."
1556.0,1559.0," You can create this infinite loop of this, the machine gun just falling through the ceiling."
1559.0,1560.0, That's kind of like a subtle knife.
1560.0,1563.0, Did any of you guys read the Philip Paulman books?
1563.0,1565.0," You know, I'm talking about his dark material."
1565.0,1566.0, Yeah.
1567.0,1569.0, The subtle knife was the second book.
1569.0,1572.0," And in that book, you could like cut a hole in the, you know,"
1572.0,1575.0, in the universe and then like stay there with the live.
1575.0,1576.0, Yeah.
1576.0,1577.0, Yeah.
1577.0,1579.0, I didn't know you knew the lingo.
1579.0,1581.0," Oh, I guess you read it too."
1581.0,1584.0, I'm going to say regular doors cannot do what Darren just described.
1584.0,1585.0, Sorry.
1585.0,1586.0, Yeah.
1586.0,1587.0, I think you're right.
1587.0,1588.0, Okay.
1588.0,1589.0, So that's the basic premise for the game.
1589.0,1592.0, It's kind of like a lost coast kind of like add on into.
1592.0,1595.0, The premise is what to show off the technology.
1595.0,1596.0, Exactly.
1596.0,1598.0," But you can also, but it's like, it's like a puzzle solving game."
1598.0,1602.0," Most of the teams like basically, you get to get to certain points in each area."
1602.0,1604.0, And you do that by manipulating your.
1604.0,1608.0," I heard a few other examples from someone who I can't name, who had actually."
1608.0,1612.0, Got to test this technology turned out more than a year and a half ago.
1612.0,1616.0," And one example he gave, he actually tried it had no idea what it was for."
1616.0,1617.0, And my can't you name him?
1617.0,1619.0, Because he's in our building.
1619.0,1622.0," And he was, it wasn't an NBA, but it was never one."
1622.0,1623.0, Anyway.
1624.0,1627.0," So an example would be, you know, there's this ball of energy going around."
1627.0,1630.0, You're immediately thinking of the orbs in half life too.
1630.0,1634.0," But, uh, it basically what you need to do is you need to fit it into some place."
1634.0,1638.0," So as it's passing around like a pinball, you throw up a portal that's an entry place for it."
1638.0,1639.0, Or you get the exit first.
1639.0,1643.0," So you basically set up, you know, a path or a conduit for it."
1643.0,1647.0, So that it's say it's passing by you enters the portal and then it goes out the other direction.
1647.0,1651.0, But up in up in the sky somewhere and then fits into some other place.
1651.0,1654.0, And then you need to get yourself up there once that door opens.
1654.0,1657.0," But it sounds like a kind of like, you know,"
1657.0,1661.0," consoles, metal gears got, uh, the VR missions, bonus things."
1661.0,1665.0, But they kind of like take the fundamental gameplay and they just like boil it down to.
1665.0,1667.0, So it seems kind of like that.
1667.0,1668.0, It feels like the are.
1668.0,1669.0, It feels like the are.
1669.0,1670.0, It feels like the are.
1670.0,1672.0, It's a separate stand alone game that's going to ship with half life episode.
1672.0,1674.0, So it's so nice.
1674.0,1675.0, That's a lot of that.
1675.0,1676.0, That 18 fortress to.
1676.0,1678.0," I mean, like team porch two is going to come in."
1678.0,1680.0," So it sounds like, you know, a pretty busy."
1681.0,1682.0, They're working hard now.
1682.0,1684.0, They were kind of a radio silent there for a while.
1684.0,1685.0, They're just.
1685.0,1689.0, And so actually something kind of crazy that a lot of people aren't really kind of touching upon as much as that.
1689.0,1693.0, They've worked out the source engine so that they can co develop and like basically create the same.
1693.0,1696.0, So they can have a game simultaneously release on three platforms if they need to.
1696.0,1700.0," So when by the time when half episode two comes out,"
1700.0,1703.0, it's going to be out on the 360 possibly the PS3 as well.
1703.0,1705.0, Not the way.
1705.0,1706.0, We.
1706.0,1707.0, That's not going to work.
1707.0,1708.0, No.
1708.0,1711.0, It's just the gravity gun would be awesome with that controller.
1711.0,1712.0, I'm fun with that.
1712.0,1713.0, There.
1713.0,1714.0, I make it a kid.
1714.0,1718.0," It's called what Elebits or something and all it is is basically imagine if you had a gravity gun demo,"
1718.0,1721.0, but all you could do is point the gun around and pick stuff up.
1721.0,1723.0, What the hell you do different in half.
1723.0,1724.0, I've.
1724.0,1726.0," Yeah, but you can't throw it."
1726.0,1728.0, There's no objective is just a pick stuff up.
1728.0,1729.0, Find little Elebits.
1729.0,1733.0," Oh, and by the way, there's one thing during his speech,"
1733.0,1735.0, Gabe was talking about this one bit of freeware.
1735.0,1737.0," That's out right now called our,"
1737.0,1739.0, Bicular drop or something like that.
1739.0,1741.0, Or basically he referenced this bit of freeware.
1741.0,1743.0, It's a game about how it's.
1743.0,1749.0, It's a really goofy game with like princesses and dragons and stuff.
1749.0,1752.0, But you actually create these portals and it's the same kind of idea and technology.
1752.0,1754.0, And it's a bit killer.
1754.0,1755.0, Yeah.
1755.0,1757.0, Have they been any good on Hubbard video games?
1757.0,1758.0," Oh, sure."
1758.0,1759.0, They made a version of it.
1759.0,1761.0, Have they made a battle field there?
1761.0,1762.0, It's a good.
1762.0,1763.0, Yeah.
1763.0,1764.0, Really isn't really good.
1764.0,1765.0," Like, did it open your eyes?"
1765.0,1767.0," Why don't they have where you turn your,"
1767.0,1770.0," Do you yet Nintendo DS, no whatever they call that."
1770.0,1772.0, A slate table reader is no.
1772.0,1773.0," They're a little, a little, a meter."
1773.0,1774.0," They're, yeah, they're a meter."
1774.0,1776.0, Who's the dude that you meet?
1776.0,1777.0, Who's the big dude that you meet?
1777.0,1778.0, Who's the big dude that run?
1778.0,1779.0, Has he knew?
1779.0,1780.0," Oh, he knew?"
1780.0,1781.0, He's the big dude.
1781.0,1782.0, Do you know where in Joshua Boulder?
1782.0,1783.0, So he's the second.
1783.0,1784.0, He'd be the final boss.
1784.0,1785.0, He's at the right hand.
1785.0,1787.0," He's like, he's like level 50."
1787.0,1788.0," No, you don't have to work."
1788.0,1791.0," Like, I've told the others like enough to solve it."
1791.0,1792.0, You don't fight them.
1792.0,1793.0," Ryan, shaking the foot here."
1793.0,1794.0, Ryan's in matching up.
1794.0,1795.0," We're all gonna, if we all do this at that."
1795.0,1796.0, We're gonna do next to you.
1796.0,1797.0, Yeah.
1797.0,1798.0, There's no where we went.
1798.0,1799.0, Yeah.
1799.0,1800.0, Tom Cruise got to us.
1800.0,1801.0, We went to kill them all.
1801.0,1802.0, We're up ahead with the Zine.
1802.0,1803.0, What's your crime?
1803.0,1804.0, What's your crime?
1804.0,1805.0, What's your crime?
1805.0,1806.0, It's a bad though.
1806.0,1807.0," We're, all right."
1807.0,1808.0, So where were we?
1808.0,1810.0," We were talking about, we were talking about,"
1810.0,1811.0, We were talking about to the E.A. thing.
1811.0,1812.0, What is it?
1812.0,1813.0, Was there other good stuff?
1813.0,1814.0, No.
1814.0,1815.0, They showed us.
1815.0,1818.0," Basically, the CG for the White Council,"
1818.0,1820.0," which is the Lord of the Rings RPG,"
1821.0,1825.0, also coming to PC set prior to the films and the novels.
1825.0,1826.0, Eight years.
1826.0,1828.0," So, uh, the RPG."
1828.0,1832.0," It's an action RPG that kind of, they're trying to make it all like it's a really high-resd"
1832.0,1833.0, oblo kind of thing.
1833.0,1835.0," Well, the CG they showed was just amazing."
1835.0,1837.0," It's a part of the, you know, this is our target video."
1837.0,1841.0, And we have every reason to believe it will look exactly like this.
1841.0,1845.0, We have no reason whatsoever to believe it's going to look anything like that.
1845.0,1847.0, Why so skeptical.
1847.0,1848.0, You always open this up.
1848.0,1849.0, It's a little trouble.
1849.0,1851.0," It was like, the only film that's with CG."
1851.0,1852.0," It all, it all, it all, it all, it all, it all, it all, it all."
1852.0,1853.0, Fair enough.
1853.0,1856.0," They're like, I remember like a year ago when the, they showed a fight night round three."
1856.0,1859.0," And they're like, it's going to look just like this and everyone's like, yeah, right, whatever."
1859.0,1861.0, And it came out and on the 360 it looked just like they said.
1861.0,1862.0," I believe, yeah."
1862.0,1865.0," I think that was one of the few things when they showed for PS3,"
1865.0,1867.0," they're like, okay, that one we believe."
1867.0,1868.0, Yeah.
1868.0,1869.0, Okay.
1869.0,1870.0, I talked to you.
1870.0,1871.0, This was like Kill Zone.
1871.0,1872.0, Stop.
1872.0,1875.0, If you remember the electronic entertainment expo we're talking about was with 2005 and one of the PS3
1876.0,1877.0, demos they showed.
1877.0,1882.0, Computer generated footage that they passed off as real time for for the system.
1882.0,1883.0, And it was kind of like that.
1883.0,1885.0, This is your gut says this.
1885.0,1887.0, An action RPG is not going to look like this.
1887.0,1891.0," I mean, like, it wasn't like it was like Pixar maybe four years ago or something."
1891.0,1892.0, Okay.
1892.0,1893.0, What they showed was of that quality.
1893.0,1894.0, Yeah.
1894.0,1895.0, What's the game called again?
1895.0,1896.0," Uh, the white council."
1896.0,1897.0, A load of the rings of white council.
1897.0,1898.0, The white council.
1898.0,1899.0, White council.
1899.0,1901.0, Formally known as Project Great Company.
1901.0,1902.0, You know what?
1902.0,1903.0, Other than that.
1903.0,1904.0, It was wrong.
1904.0,1905.0, I'm afraid.
1905.0,1906.0, A lot of this.
1906.0,1907.0, Yeah.
1907.0,1908.0, The cult studio showcase.
1908.0,1910.0," It seemed like, you know, they're redheaded"
1910.0,1912.0, Stept children that they wanted to get attention for.
1912.0,1916.0," So it's like they could draw captive audience get people from around the world, you know,"
1916.0,1920.0," International press there and say, you know, hey, there's this big event."
1920.0,1922.0, It's going to be worth your time and you get there.
1922.0,1924.0, And it's like there is hands on on the sports games.
1924.0,1926.0," You know, which is great if you're in the sports."
1926.0,1927.0, I know seven.
1927.0,1928.0," You know, a big fan."
1928.0,1929.0," But I mean, just say it."
1929.0,1930.0," I mean, that that's never."
1930.0,1932.0," It never is as exciting as, you know,"
1933.0,1934.0," So no, uh, Superman return."
1934.0,1937.0," And it's Superman returns, which is just like,"
1937.0,1938.0, Shavefully bad.
1938.0,1942.0," And then the Godfather 360, which is, you know, you've already played it, but look,"
1942.0,1945.0, Here's some high risk textures of crap geometry.
1945.0,1948.0," Uh, but what the hell were you saying about the gameplay and stuff,"
1948.0,1950.0, Superman before we came on about.
1950.0,1952.0, Think about the city having health bar and stuff.
1952.0,1953.0, Superman.
1953.0,1954.0," Yeah, superman."
1954.0,1955.0, The city has a light.
1955.0,1956.0, The city has a light.
1956.0,1957.0, The sorrow.
1957.0,1958.0, Second.
1958.0,1959.0, It's been schools.
1959.0,1960.0, That's all.
1960.0,1961.0, The city dies.
1961.0,1962.0, You die.
1962.0,1963.0, Yeah.
1963.0,1964.0," And you don't say the city, then."
1964.0,1967.0, But I walked up and he was the guy was playing.
1967.0,1968.0, He was Bizarro.
1968.0,1970.0, He was like the evil Superman.
1970.0,1972.0," He's like Superman, but purple."
1972.0,1973.0, So he's evil.
1973.0,1974.0," But anyway, talks funny."
1974.0,1975.0, All the citizens were running around frightened.
1975.0,1978.0, And then the bizarre guy just kind of lets the controller idle.
1978.0,1980.0," And then all this, a couple of the citizens, like,"
1980.0,1983.0," got up on his back and did their towering animation, like halfway"
1983.0,1984.0, in him and on him.
1984.0,1986.0," And it was like, I've had enough."
1986.0,1987.0," Oh, four guys."
1987.0,1988.0, We're going to turn around.
1988.0,1989.0, It took a look at the Sims two heads.
1989.0,1993.0," Also, you know, you can just Superman game it been out already."
1993.0,1994.0, It should have.
1994.0,1995.0, They were going to.
1995.0,1996.0, They were going to have to wait for the movie.
1996.0,1997.0, Yeah.
1997.0,1998.0, That guess.
1998.0,1999.0, But that's a Lincoln.
1999.0,2000.0, It's related to the DVD.
2000.0,2001.0, Here's something like that.
2001.0,2002.0, This is a legacy.
2002.0,2005.0," I mean, you can't, what's a good Superman game."
2005.0,2011.0, Pretty much every Superman game that's ever been released for any platform has been the worst game of its respective generation.
2011.0,2013.0," Also, I mean, how could it be latest?"
2013.0,2016.0, This movie's been in development for like 10 years.
2016.0,2017.0, What has nothing to do with that?
2017.0,2022.0," With the, he's fighting space dragons and final fantasy like bottom it guys and stuff."
2022.0,2024.0, Are you saying serious?
2024.0,2026.0, See it in the bizarrow?
2026.0,2029.0, He's throwing like Bob's big boy signs at people.
2029.0,2030.0, Really?
2030.0,2031.0, Screw that.
2031.0,2033.0," Yeah, I don't want to talk about anymore."
2033.0,2035.0," Well, though, we isn't even coming out on PC."
2035.0,2036.0," No, I don't think so."
2036.0,2038.0, We're wasting even more time.
2038.0,2042.0," Yeah, we're trying to change the crappy Superman game that's not even on PC."
2042.0,2044.0, We're going to hear first.
2044.0,2045.0, I come up.
2045.0,2046.0, I think it's time for news.
2046.0,2049.0," Okay, we're going to go on to Darren."
2049.0,2050.0, Darren's news bit.
2050.0,2052.0, We're going to be a song.
2052.0,2053.0," Yeah, I need a song."
2053.0,2055.0, You got to read it in a nerd voice.
2055.0,2057.0," Yeah, someone do the teletypathy."
2057.0,2060.0, Today in video game news for your Delling Goath of Gaming Goodness.
2060.0,2061.0," No, no, no, no, no."
2061.0,2062.0, I'll do that.
2062.0,2063.0, No.
2063.0,2068.0," Okay, so first up, this is at this happened late last week."
2068.0,2074.0, Mark Reane at the developed conference in Brighton slammed episodic gaming.
2074.0,2075.0," Yeah, Mark Reane."
2075.0,2076.0, Tell the folks who Mark Reane.
2076.0,2081.0," Mark Reane, the VP of Epic Games, who's never soft spoke and always has an opinion."
2081.0,2082.0, I love the guy.
2082.0,2084.0, Here's what he says.
2084.0,2087.0, I've heard a lot of insane talk about episodic content.
2087.0,2090.0, Very little of it makes any actual sense to broken business.
2090.0,2093.0, And then he goes on to say customers are supposed to buy half a game for 20 bucks.
2093.0,2094.0, Then wait six months for an episode.
2094.0,2099.0," When I put a game down, I want to try and do an episodic games that offer faster turnaround."
2099.0,2102.0, We'll inevitably be using a lot of recycled content walking through the same environments
2102.0,2105.0, and shooting the same enemies with the same weapons.
2105.0,2110.0, He pretty much started on it.
2110.0,2112.0, How do you really feel?
2112.0,2113.0, He kind of did.
2113.0,2119.0," He's got some valid, I mean, that's like reiterating what all of our fears are in the worst case scenario."
2119.0,2120.0, Absolutely.
2120.0,2121.0, The same old crap.
2121.0,2127.0," If it's coming rapidly and otherwise the weight seems so long that you're, you know, you're thinking,"
2127.0,2129.0," well, why not just give us another full game."
2129.0,2130.0, And those are those are valid.
2131.0,2137.0," The only thing I was kind of running through my head is can't the same thing be said for full, it's a full games that aren't episodic"
2137.0,2142.0," that recycle content and have the same weapons and, you know, very little new imaginative stuff."
2142.0,2144.0, Expansion packs.
2144.0,2148.0, And then you're waiting for expansion packs come out in there's your episodic content.
2148.0,2149.0, Right.
2149.0,2153.0," I mean, can any of us defend against what he said there?"
2153.0,2154.0," No, I still don't actually."
2154.0,2155.0, We have to see.
2155.0,2157.0," You know, it's like, it's still early enough."
2157.0,2159.0," I mean, like, and no one's actually like figured out the right pricing model."
2159.0,2161.0, We haven't even seen the second episode of any.
2161.0,2162.0, Right.
2162.0,2167.0," So on a way, that's the only real criticism of what he did was a sort of like, you know, kind of"
2167.0,2169.0, ranting kind of prematurely there.
2169.0,2172.0, A little bit of an old man get off my lawn thing.
2172.0,2173.0, Isn't it?
2173.0,2174.0," You know,"
2174.0,2175.0, Shepashaddy gaming.
2175.0,2177.0," Well, we don't have a lot of that in my games."
2177.0,2179.0, We had full games.
2179.0,2182.0," I mean, there's a lot of companies now that are taking, you know,"
2182.0,2185.0," is going to start taking some big games with, you know, Valvo obviously and tell,"
2185.0,2187.0," tell, tell us, back at home business on episodic gaming."
2187.0,2191.0," And don't we feel like so far the valve did it kind of well, I mean,"
2191.0,2192.0, I like episode one.
2192.0,2193.0, I enjoyed it.
2193.0,2200.0," I just got the point about studies complaining about, but what we've seen of the next one looks like it's going to introduce the long new stuff."
2200.0,2201.0, Right.
2201.0,2202.0, But then you're waiting more than six months for it.
2202.0,2203.0, Aren't you?
2203.0,2204.0," I mean, how low and it's about six."
2204.0,2205.0, It's about six.
2205.0,2206.0, Will be okay.
2206.0,2210.0," And that's better than, I mean, traditionally what what's about been between full"
2210.0,2212.0," sequels, you know,"
2212.0,2213.0, years.
2213.0,2214.0, Yeah.
2214.0,2215.0, Yeah.
2215.0,2216.0, The decade or whatever.
2216.0,2218.0," It's the expansions, but it's kind of like you have to count their own stuff."
2218.0,2220.0," Not something that they've harmed out, you know?"
2220.0,2221.0, Yeah.
2221.0,2222.0, Yeah.
2222.0,2224.0, And what else you got of the news ticket there?
2224.0,2225.0, All right.
2225.0,2226.0, What would it?
2226.0,2227.0, I'll do a little next up.
2227.0,2229.0, Whatever.
2229.0,2232.0," Whatever anti-terrorist action happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."
2232.0,2237.0," Okay, the, okay, according to Las Vegas TV station at KL, AS TV,"
2237.0,2242.0, Mayor Oster Goldman and other Vegas officials plan to fight the release of
2242.0,2245.0, Rainbow Six Vegas.
2245.0,2248.0, What they're afraid is going to give Vegas a bad next.
2248.0,2249.0, Exactly.
2249.0,2250.0, Okay.
2250.0,2252.0," Play, say, saw on the video game."
2252.0,2255.0," They plan to, they plan to fight the release by,"
2255.0,2258.0," let me say, Golden Goodman says that,"
2258.0,2262.0," that Rainbow Six Vegas is based on a false premise in that the game,"
2262.0,2263.0," quote,"
2263.0,2265.0," could be harmful economically,"
2265.0,2269.0, and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech protection.
2269.0,2270.0," Oh, quite a lie."
2271.0,2272.0, What?
2272.0,2275.0," I mean, basically, it's going to tell a town where you can get drunk at the"
2275.0,2280.0," Rulet table, meet a hooker, and then go up to your room and, and a game based"
2280.0,2282.0, upon fighting terrorists is offensive.
2282.0,2285.0," Hey, with a pop guy for a mayor."
2285.0,2288.0," But, like, a little lady, you're going to play this game and stop dropping their"
2288.0,2290.0, quarters in the machine.
2290.0,2292.0," That's, that's not."
2292.0,2294.0," I mean, I didn't even, that's all you can really say."
2294.0,2296.0, I'm just a gas at that.
2296.0,2298.0, I didn't even know they cared about their reputation there.
2298.0,2301.0," I thought they're cultivating the reputation that, like, you know, this is"
2301.0,2303.0," Babylon, you know?"
2303.0,2304.0," Yeah, anything goes."
2304.0,2306.0, These are the end times of the American-
2306.0,2307.0, This is a rush.
2307.0,2310.0," They, uh, city San Francisco, suit, uh, who is it?"
2310.0,2311.0, Atari on that one?
2311.0,2312.0, Because they weren't at a rush?
2312.0,2314.0," Well, they just, it's, it's not representation,"
2314.0,2317.0," uh, it's any of the, it's just driving style out here."
2317.0,2320.0, It's not right.
2320.0,2323.0," I'm just joking, Kromic, but you get the deal."
2323.0,2326.0," I mean, you can say that about all of all the cities that have New York in it,"
2327.0,2329.0," and it's like, right, we're books like,"
2329.0,2330.0, and a city to protest.
2330.0,2333.0, Don't write a bad poem about Las Vegas.
2333.0,2337.0, Some like just video games or evil bandwagoning.
2337.0,2338.0," Yeah, that's how fun book is."
2338.0,2340.0, Their whole city is evil.
2340.0,2342.0," I mean, I like it."
2342.0,2343.0, There's a big room.
2343.0,2345.0," There's a city is grandendre, a cemetery."
2345.0,2346.0, Yeah.
2346.0,2347.0, Wow.
2347.0,2348.0, Okay.
2348.0,2349.0," Well, that was a good news, bit."
2349.0,2351.0, We'll have to follow up with that.
2351.0,2352.0, We'll check that out.
2352.0,2354.0, We should invite the Mayor of Las Vegas onto the podcast.
2354.0,2355.0, That would be nice.
2356.0,2358.0," Next time I go to Vegas, I'll look for a old man voice."
2358.0,2361.0, You can't stop playing games in my code.
2365.0,2366.0, Okay. What else there?
2366.0,2367.0, All right.
2367.0,2368.0, Okay.
2368.0,2370.0, Apparently hungry is full of space pricks.
2370.0,2372.0, That's all you need to say.
2372.0,2373.0, I agree with full space pricks.
2373.0,2375.0," Well, like we didn't know that."
2375.0,2376.0, Okay.
2376.0,2377.0, What does that mean?
2377.0,2378.0, Ryan's face.
2378.0,2380.0, I don't like that.
2380.0,2381.0, Okay.
2381.0,2382.0, Yeah.
2382.0,2384.0, So this is from gamepolitics.com.
2385.0,2386.0, I'll just read it for a start.
2386.0,2387.0, I'll hear.
2387.0,2389.0, Kill any non-romatian alien prick and cold blood.
2389.0,2392.0, That's the goal of a mission in Romanian's in space.
2392.0,2394.0, A game being developed for the PC.
2394.0,2395.0, Yeah.
2395.0,2397.0, That's PC gaming isn't dead folks.
2397.0,2400.0, It's being developed by a 20-round 21-year-old programmer from Romania.
2400.0,2401.0, So let me see.
2401.0,2404.0," The games, alien pricks are not entirely the outer space variety."
2404.0,2407.0, They include ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.
2407.0,2411.0, As a as a as a as a as a plot of Romanian's in space explains.
2412.0,2419.0," The remainder of former, basically this is a far-flung future where apparently Romania now rules the conquerors of the world and is in space and stuff."
2419.0,2421.0, What does he say?
2421.0,2423.0," Why does he say, uh,"
2423.0,2426.0, Kill any non-romatian alien prick?
2426.0,2429.0," I mean, what aliens out there are Romanian?"
2429.0,2432.0, Apparently a whole lot of them.
2432.0,2435.0, They get around to get their freak on in space.
2435.0,2438.0, It's a double on taudio with the word alien.
2439.0,2440.0, It's really is.
2440.0,2442.0, There's lots of double on taundras.
2442.0,2444.0, It forms some sort of quadruple on taundras.
2444.0,2446.0," Okay, so anyway, apparently,"
2446.0,2449.0," um, this, it's just a meant as a joke."
2449.0,2451.0, It sounds like it should be a flash game.
2451.0,2452.0," Yeah, yeah."
2452.0,2455.0, I like to go on whatever.
2455.0,2456.0," Well, I check down the screenshots."
2456.0,2461.0," I mean, it looks like it could be like freeware or something you'd pay like, you know, ten bucks for something."
2461.0,2463.0, But it's not like that big.
2463.0,2466.0," I mean, it's, I think he's just kind of, he might even be just generating."
2467.0,2470.0," It's like, it's going to get all this news."
2470.0,2472.0," Just like, you'll see a news report about, you know,"
2472.0,2475.0," here's this game where you murder immigrants, you know,"
2475.0,2478.0, because we have like a legal catcher and stuff that popped up on.
2478.0,2480.0, But they're kind of missing the whole thing.
2480.0,2482.0," It's like these are coming out of people's like garages and,"
2482.0,2486.0," anonymously, and then, I mean, I'm not saying they're, they're, they're right or they're moral,"
2486.0,2488.0," but there's part of that whole,"
2488.0,2491.0," that milieu of like, just extreme internet,"
2491.0,2495.0," you know, just trying to be offensive, trying to be a soft park."
2495.0,2497.0, Right exactly. Yeah.
2497.0,2500.0, A single person expressing himself through game design and this game.
2500.0,2501.0, Right.
2501.0,2502.0, Just being stupid.
2502.0,2504.0, Like escape from Neverland was another good flood.
2504.0,2505.0," Yeah, exactly."
2505.0,2507.0, It was a real good one.
2507.0,2508.0, This is a really good one.
2508.0,2510.0, I'm just sitting here reading that summary of this game.
2510.0,2512.0," It's, what the hell."
2512.0,2516.0, Chao Chescu has taken over the United States and then the earth.
2516.0,2518.0, And then the earth.
2518.0,2522.0," You got some like, who, who's the guy making this game?"
2522.0,2523.0, He needs some help.
2524.0,2527.0, He's a Hungarian Romanian.
2527.0,2528.0," Next, delivers."
2528.0,2530.0," At Exenju Duta, cut the light out for a heat."
2530.0,2532.0, We're sending you out of lifeline right now.
2532.0,2534.0," He needs a therapist, rather than making a game."
2534.0,2535.0, He needs a hug.
2538.0,2541.0, Okay. So I keep a keep a look at for Romanians and space.
2542.0,2544.0, The demo is coming to your PC.
2544.0,2548.0, Sounds like the first must play a game of the year.
2548.0,2551.0," That's right. That actually, that's the game of changes everything from what I hear from us."
2551.0,2554.0," Yeah, I always wanted to kill non-Ramenian aliens before."
2554.0,2555.0, That's a chance.
2555.0,2558.0," Because if there's so many Romanian aliens in space, I just,"
2558.0,2561.0, We're also from in Pray where probably Romanian Romanian aliens.
2561.0,2564.0, Okay.
2564.0,2566.0, Do you got anything else there?
2566.0,2567.0," Well, do we have a pound?"
2567.0,2570.0," Well, you know what, for the sake of time, should we probably just get ahead to,"
2570.0,2571.0, How would you and I'm tired?
2571.0,2573.0, We're already at over 14 minutes.
2573.0,2574.0, Really?
2574.0,2576.0," You know, the people like the long podcasts."
2576.0,2577.0, They do.
2577.0,2578.0, Okay.
2578.0,2579.0, I've spoken to the people.
2579.0,2581.0, And that's what they've told me.
2581.0,2582.0, All right.
2582.0,2583.0," All right. Well, let's see."
2583.0,2584.0," See, we can continue next time."
2584.0,2585.0, Okay. So more news come on.
2585.0,2586.0, More news. Tell them.
2586.0,2587.0, Let's tell them.
2587.0,2588.0," Oh, tell them now."
2588.0,2592.0, Some kid Bobby pre-ordered a video game today.
2592.0,2593.0," Oh, no way."
2593.0,2594.0, That's really?
2594.0,2595.0, Yeah.
2595.0,2596.0, Yeah.
2596.0,2597.0, That was Sean's news.
2597.0,2599.0, That's why Darren does the news.
2599.0,2600.0," Bobby, teenagers."
2600.0,2601.0, Sean's news.
2601.0,2603.0, I have clean shoes on today.
2603.0,2604.0, Okay.
2604.0,2607.0, So we got a lot of reader mail.
2608.0,2609.0, We actually always do.
2609.0,2610.0, Usually we just ignore it.
2610.0,2614.0, But we're going to pay attention because we care because we love you.
2614.0,2618.0, So we're going to go over a few that came up on the messageports this week.
2618.0,2619.0, I'm going to read.
2619.0,2621.0, But so I'll read the one about physics.
2621.0,2622.0, I was a good one.
2622.0,2623.0, Yep.
2623.0,2626.0, From our pal Drew's three or is it draws?
2626.0,2627.0, I'm sorry.
2627.0,2630.0, He's a Drew Drew Drew's on our on the messageport.
2630.0,2633.0, And I'll read this for Betem.
2633.0,2636.0, Why isn't anyone taking a dump on physics?
2636.0,2639.0," What we ever did today now, Broadway show."
2640.0,2642.0," But that whole stuff was being done on Jackson Show news,"
2642.0,2644.0, it was from IMA series.
2644.0,2648.0," But the этот VCTV episode, Now, it's that issue."
2648.0,2652.0, It's hitting on the軍's.
2658.0,2660.0, Dammit.
2660.0,2661.0, But it's check.
2663.0,2664.0, ProRes.
2664.0,2665.0, Yeah.
2665.0,2666.0, that in the July issue?
2666.0,2667.0, Yeah.
2667.0,2668.0, Yeah.
2668.0,2669.0, We didn't dump on it to go.
2669.0,2670.0, We said that it's way-
2670.0,2672.0, Let's just- there's no software for it.
2672.0,2673.0, That's the problem.
2673.0,2675.36, And the- and the- well the thing is there's only one game that even kind of supports it right
2675.36,2677.64, now and it's Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter.
2677.64,2681.08, And- and that's not a game that's really- it's not built from the beginning optimized
2681.08,2682.08, for it.
2682.08,2683.08, Yeah.
2683.08,2685.08," And there's how much is- of it's going to take advantage of, you know."
2685.08,2687.48, Well I mean like you see more part- you see a couple more particles in the environment
2687.48,2689.88," and stuff like that, you know, in big deal."
2689.88,2692.84, But actually the funny thing- well the sad thing I guess I should say is that the drivers were
2692.84,2697.2000000000003, someone optimized that when you started playing it with- and it would see your- your- a G-card.
2697.2000000000003,2699.4, The game would actually slow down further.
2699.4,2702.88," So basically, the- the H- the H- the H- the G- card was actually making your game worse."
2702.88,2703.88, That sounds awesome.
2703.88,2704.88, Awesome.
2704.88,2707.88, And- and- and how much money could you spend to make your game look worse?
2707.88,2708.88," I mean, it was a mere 300 bucks."
2708.88,2709.88," It turned- Oh, it was a 300 bucks?"
2709.88,2710.88, It was a 300 bucks?
2710.88,2711.88, Yeah.
2711.88,2712.88, Awesome.
2712.88,2716.4," You know, I think it's- it's early technology and I think they- I mean they have to a really"
2716.4,2717.4, rough story.
2717.4,2718.88," Well it's like the first video card, the first graphics card."
2718.88,2719.88, Exactly.
2719.92,2721.96, At some point it was like it was a joke.
2721.96,2722.96, What is this?
2722.96,2723.96, We don't need it.
2723.96,2724.96, Right.
2724.96,2729.48, So maybe it's got a paper- the way that- that a physics card- dedicated physics card is- is never
2729.48,2730.96, going to happen in the future.
2730.96,2732.96," Well, I- they advertise on our magazine."
2732.96,2734.44, I don't think so.
2734.44,2735.44," No, yeah, okay, good."
2735.44,2736.44, Okay.
2736.44,2737.44, Okay.
2737.44,2738.96," Otherwise, I'd say you guys are wrong."
2738.96,2739.96, I just-
2739.96,2740.96, What is the software?
2740.96,2741.96, Where's the-
2741.96,2745.2000000000003," Well, no, I- I think like there was one game of a particular that was the only one I've seen that"
2745.2000000000003,2748.32, actually was built with it with this physics technology in mind.
2748.4,2749.32, Self-actor.
2749.32,2753.0800000000004," And it's still really early on, but that game actually shows a lot of promise."
2753.0800000000004,2754.0800000000004, And that's the thing that you need-
2754.0800000000004,2755.0800000000004, I think you can get interested.
2755.0800000000004,2757.2000000000003, Why- why would I want a physics card?
2757.2000000000003,2758.8, I got enough cards in my machine.
2758.8,2759.96," Well, I- I think there was-"
2759.96,2760.96, I just have a card there.
2760.96,2761.32, There is a thing-
2761.32,2765.1200000000003, It could be an amazing for you for the- I mean the number of things you could do with
2765.1200000000003,2769.76, gameplay instead of having your CPU chug when you're half-life and you throw a grenade
2769.76,2772.6000000000004," at it, rack and like more than the threshold of objects."
2772.6000000000004,2774.6000000000004, Just put on the cards and one- a-
2774.6000000000004,2777.2400000000002," Is- a card, a graphics card, a sound card."
2777.2400000000002,2777.76," I mean, just-"
2777.76,2779.88," Well, I mean, I- I- I think about this way a lot of people."
2779.88,2782.5200000000004," They don't even have to buy an engine, a transmission."
2782.5200000000004,2785.7200000000003, I don't think they make one thing.
2785.7200000000003,2787.8, Why don't they get an engine with the tire on it?
2787.8,2789.0, They need a change in the position.
2789.0,2790.7200000000003, Which they call a car.
2790.7200000000003,2793.1600000000003, I don't have to buy them all separate.
2793.1600000000003,2794.1600000000003, Get the brakes be optional.
2794.1600000000003,2795.44, I'm sure-
2795.44,2797.0800000000004, Why don't you build your cars?
2797.0800000000004,2800.44," If it becomes popular enough, you'll be able to order a PC that's-"
2800.44,2801.6400000000003, That's what I want to want there.
2801.6400000000003,2802.6400000000003, I don't want to have to buy it.
2802.6400000000003,2803.0400000000004, But it's-
2803.0400000000004,2803.44, It's really-
2803.44,2804.44, It's really-
2804.44,2807.6800000000003," Well, Delso offering it up in their new computers in the XPS-700s."
2808.08,2809.04, And-
2809.04,2811.24," They are- I mean, I think ultimately, they're the kind of work toward"
2811.24,2813.9199999999996," is getting it on the motherboard or some kind of like, you know, close to the course."
2813.9199999999996,2814.8399999999997, You don't even think about it.
2814.8399999999997,2816.12, Like you buy the back of the spare.
2816.12,2816.64, Yeah.
2816.64,2818.04, It's one of those if the support isn't there.
2818.04,2818.52, It's right.
2818.52,2821.9199999999996," I'm surprised, like, games like Crisis of any game would totally build a use."
2821.9199999999996,2822.9199999999996, Like that would be an example.
2822.9199999999996,2826.7599999999998," So instead of just having a couple of explodable barrels and boxes move,"
2826.7599999999998,2830.12," you have like every, you know, well, every leaf pretty much is moving."
2830.12,2832.7599999999998," And- and not only just, you know, textures moving around,"
2832.7599999999998,2835.64, but actual geometry that's moving and interacting.
2835.64,2836.7999999999997, And that-
2836.88,2838.48," Theoretically, the card would help it."
2838.48,2839.84, Or imagine what kind of thing.
2839.84,2842.0800000000004," Imagine you do a multiplayer and you're like, you're trying to like crawl through,"
2842.0800000000004,2844.7200000000003," like the grass or something, you're like, you know, not be seen."
2844.7200000000003,2847.84," And you get up and you're a crawl, you go too fast and all these other blades and grass"
2847.84,2849.32," around, you start moving and it gives away your position."
2849.32,2851.36, That'll be troubling though to sync up that.
2851.36,2854.48," I mean, like, that's already one thing where, with Crisis multiplayer,"
2854.48,2857.2400000000002, you know how there's such a big deal about all the trees and stuff are breakable.
2857.2400000000002,2859.76," But once you've got 30 people in the server,"
2859.76,2863.0800000000004, you start trying to match up how every leaf is moving and everything.
2863.0800000000004,2865.5600000000004, And then you have to submit everyone has a physics card and-
2865.56,2866.92," So you just do, yeah."
2866.92,2870.92," And if you're building a game with physics in mind and there's a bunch of people who don't have it,"
2870.92,2873.4, suddenly their machines are going to just not be able to run.
2873.4,2874.92, Because that's not stuff you can-
2874.92,2876.7599999999998, It's just turn off if you don't want to use it.
2876.7599999999998,2877.7599999999998," No, not actually."
2877.7599999999998,2879.2," To make it, there are, there are switches."
2879.2,2880.2, Yeah.
2880.2,2883.48, It's just the transition periods always going to be balls because it's like to do anything good with it.
2883.48,2886.52, You have to make something where that's the only-
2886.52,2887.56, you have to have it.
2887.56,2888.56, It doesn't seem like-
2888.56,2891.24," Like the Tomb Raider, you need a quick-"
2891.24,2893.08," Otherwise, like, it's like, ghost recon."
2893.08,2894.68," If you can run it with or without it,"
2894.7599999999998,2899.08, there's never going to be that big of a disparity between it to show off what it can do.
2899.08,2900.7599999999998, Did you say it was going to be balls?
2900.7599999999998,2902.04, Yeah.
2902.04,2904.12," Yeah, you would Ryan look right and look so upset by that."
2904.12,2904.8399999999997, Look at him.
2904.8399999999997,2905.96, Sweaty balls right.
2905.96,2907.72," No, that's bad, right?"
2907.72,2909.0, It's something that looks like balls.
2909.0,2910.9199999999996," Well, it's not going to be hip with the length."
2910.9199999999996,2912.3599999999997, It's going to be that's balls.
2912.3599999999997,2913.56," Oh, boy."
2915.56,2916.8399999999997, It's bad.
2916.8399999999997,2917.24, You never-
2917.24,2918.04," Oh, yeah."
2918.04,2919.0, It's greasy balls.
2919.0,2920.04, It's ass.
2920.04,2921.0, That's butt.
2922.44,2923.64, That's what we're saying there.
2924.6,2925.72, How do you rank those things?
2925.72,2926.2799999999997, Ass.
2926.2799999999997,2927.08, The butt?
2927.08,2927.72," Yeah, that's-"
2927.72,2928.68," Okay, yeah."
2928.68,2929.64, That's not going to go off on that.
2929.64,2931.0, They're all doors in prey.
2931.0,2931.16, They're all-
2931.16,2931.3199999999997, They're all-
2931.3199999999997,2932.3599999999997, They're all-
2934.3599999999997,2935.3199999999997, They're all one way.
2937.96,2941.24, What was your theme earlier about the smart spink doors?
2941.24,2941.7999999999997, It wasn't mine.
2941.7999999999997,2943.8799999999997, I just wanted to give him where you're talking about prey for guys.
2943.8799999999997,2947.72, I'm going to give a shout out to the guys that's something awful.com.
2947.72,2950.52, And they had this awesome review of the demo.
2950.52,2957.16, They just pointed out that you can measure any species sort of like level of technological
2957.16,2960.04, advancement by how efficiently it uses an energy source.
2960.04,2965.08," And then anyway, that it's well known that a spink there is the most efficient"
2965.08,2969.48, means of opening and closing something in like a real human spink there that can differentiate
2969.48,2973.0, between a fart and a third the doors and prey.
2973.8,2975.0," It's how I'm sorry, Mom."
2975.0,2978.7599999999998," No, they can tell when Tommy should go through and when not to let him through."
2979.48,2980.28, And they do that.
2980.28,2983.32, And it's otherwise inexplicable what this guy figured it out.
2983.32,2984.84, Ryan just says his head in his hand.
2984.84,2986.6000000000004," Well, Tommy, this is not the weekend."
2986.6000000000004,2987.5600000000004, I'm going to have my mom kiss.
2987.5600000000004,2988.6000000000004, This is why I can't watch this.
2988.6000000000004,2991.8, This is what we stop at 40 minutes.
2991.8,2993.0," Tommy, stop at that."
2994.6000000000004,2995.32, Oh boy.
2995.32,2995.7200000000003, Okay.
2996.5200000000004,2998.1200000000003," Well, let's try to keep a couple."
2998.1200000000003,2999.4, Do a couple more of these.
2999.4,3000.5200000000004, Let's keep it clean.
3001.1600000000003,3001.7200000000003, We don't want to.
3001.7200000000003,3002.6800000000003, Good luck.
3002.6800000000003,3003.96, The nuclear dawn?
3005.2400000000002,3005.96, Nuclear nuclear.
3005.96,3006.44, Nuclear nuclear.
3006.44,3007.48, Nuclear.
3007.72,3010.6, From a charizard.
3011.32,3013.0," Laughter kills me, Bulbasaur."
3013.0,3015.2400000000002, We just let me just clarify here.
3015.2400000000002,3019.48, His quote unquote real name is charizard Bulbasaur.
3020.52,3023.08, But his nickname in quotes is laughter kills me.
3023.8,3024.2, So.
3024.2,3027.0," By the way, if that is your real name, that is the coolest name ever."
3027.0,3028.36, I think we might kid that.
3028.36,3029.48, That would be a great name.
3030.76,3032.52, When you want to hear that read off in class.
3032.52,3033.32, This is Bulbasaur.
3033.32,3035.88," Yes, Bulbasaur charizard Bulbasaur."
3035.96,3037.2400000000002, Yeah.
3037.2400000000002,3037.7200000000003, Yeah.
3037.7200000000003,3038.04, Okay.
3038.04,3039.8," Anyway, he asked about nuclear dawn."
3039.8,3041.0, It's nuclear dawn a fake.
3041.6400000000003,3043.6400000000003, I was pretty excited for this game.
3043.6400000000003,3048.12, But I've seen a lot of comments by people formally working on the game on different forums
3048.12,3049.48, supporting this conclusion.
3050.12,3054.44," And I'll answer that to the best of my ability since I wrote our last story,"
3054.44,3056.28, our only story I nuclear dawn.
3057.96,3060.28," Well, for the whole audience, what is nuclear dawn?"
3060.28,3063.2400000000002," Basically, it's a mod coming out for the source engine."
3063.24,3066.12," And it looks fantastic, especially by mod."
3066.12,3068.12, It looks good by non-mod standards.
3069.3999999999996,3070.2799999999997, So it's great looking game.
3070.2799999999997,3076.3599999999997," It's kind of similar, at least in design to what is it natural selection,"
3076.3599999999997,3077.56, which was a half life one mod.
3078.3599999999997,3081.72, But sort of set in a gin row kind of neotocial future.
3083.7999999999997,3086.04," And anyway, the stuff look great."
3086.04,3087.64, They got people that are working on it.
3087.64,3092.68," They're moonlighting that of either worked in the past with big name developers,"
3092.7599999999998,3096.04," or working with them now, or did some work for nuclear dawn,"
3096.04,3097.8799999999997," and then left, and then work with them."
3097.8799999999997,3101.08," So, and then work with big companies like Splash Damage, or something like that."
3102.2799999999997,3104.9199999999996, So the screen's a great part of what you're seeing.
3104.9199999999996,3108.68, What if what those readers seeing is that there's a lot of cattiness
3108.68,3109.7999999999997, of own mod communities.
3109.7999999999997,3112.6, The more and more I've worked with them and talk to them for different stories.
3112.6,3113.48, I've done the more I see.
3113.48,3116.2799999999997," It's kind of like art school where instead of just like,"
3116.2799999999997,3117.24," oh, that's a great drawing."
3117.24,3118.12, You're doing a really good job.
3118.12,3120.2," Everyone has got to be like, I've got to be better."
3120.2799999999997,3121.72, Damn it. That's why you're doing that.
3121.72,3124.4399999999996, Or it'll find some reason to say someone's doing this or that.
3125.08,3129.7999999999997," I don't know why, because they're all going to end up working on the same mod at one point or another."
3129.7999999999997,3131.64, Because it's a fairly small community.
3131.64,3133.56, And there's a lot of back and forth.
3133.56,3134.6, It's really incestuous.
3134.6,3137.72," And a lot of, you know, toes get stepped on and this and that."
3137.72,3140.52, We're not going to end up at EA working on Madden O9.
3140.52,3141.16, Right.
3141.16,3142.52, Or like rugby.
3143.48,3143.8799999999997, Yeah.
3143.8799999999997,3146.9199999999996, I was thinking of something like walls and drama this or that.
3147.96,3149.64, But I don't know.
3149.72,3150.92, What do you got to do to get it?
3150.92,3156.6," You know, but anyway, so there's a lot of reason and and some of the people on that team have"
3156.6,3162.44," got bad reputation among the mod community and there's, you know, what for being for being"
3162.44,3167.96, Devas for being not being or just sometimes being pretty arch in the way that they go about business.
3167.96,3171.96," You know, stealing members from other competing mod teams trying to get them over on their side."
3172.68,3173.24, And this and that.
3173.24,3175.7999999999997," But basically what happened with the screens is, you know,"
3175.96,3180.84, I wasn't formed before we received them that they had finalized the heads up display.
3181.5600000000004,3186.04, And so that they wanted to take a mock up and overlay it on the actual screenshots that they have.
3186.04,3188.04," And that was a pretty fairly, that's a fairly common practice."
3188.04,3192.36," They said, you know, hey, it's going to look better than this when we when we finalize one."
3192.36,3193.88, It's just the last thing on our mind right now.
3193.88,3197.6400000000003," We want the game to work before we get, you know, we worry about the exact crosshair we're using and stuff."
3198.2000000000003,3199.5600000000004, And that's a fairly common practice.
3199.5600000000004,3200.76, Big publisher stood all the time.
3200.76,3205.32," You know, the EA's, it's the developer, no name and publisher's end developers."
3205.32,3206.6800000000003, But it's fairly common.
3206.6800000000003,3209.0," So I was like, hey, that's fine, you know, it's not a big deal."
3209.0,3215.1600000000003," So because of that, and people did work out that the heads up display had been sort of super"
3215.1600000000003,3215.8, imposed on there.
3215.8,3218.84, They immediately said that the whole thing was spoken mirrors.
3218.84,3219.4, Right.
3219.4,3221.0," And well, that's not the case."
3221.0,3225.4," From from everything I've seen, I mean, the guys at the team constantly show me new screens."
3225.4,3226.2000000000003, That what they're doing.
3226.2000000000003,3231.1600000000003," And it's just, it doesn't make sense that they would be generating this many fakes and frauds"
3231.1600000000003,3233.4, of the same scenes from all these different angles.
3234.36,3237.08," On such a regular basis, we're going to get anyone."
3237.08,3237.8, What's the point?
3237.8,3238.6, Why would you do it?
3238.6,3238.92, Right.
3238.92,3239.56, Why would you do it?
3239.56,3240.44, That was my question.
3240.44,3241.64, There's no reason at all to do it.
3241.64,3241.96, Right.
3241.96,3244.12," They're not like getting huge, you know."
3244.12,3244.44, Yeah.
3244.44,3245.8, It's not like they got a finance or in there.
3245.8,3246.12, Right.
3246.12,3248.76," And they're like, I'm going to pull smoke and mirrors over some like, right."
3248.76,3252.52," Didn't there, Don, you know, isn't getting like $2 million worth of investment money?"
3252.52,3253.8, Don't get any money at all.
3253.8,3254.76, So yeah.
3254.76,3255.8, So there's the loan.
3255.8,3256.92, So it is a real game.
3256.92,3257.2400000000002, Yeah.
3257.2400000000002,3258.2000000000003, Because our answer to you.
3258.2000000000003,3259.48, So have they given you any game?
3259.48,3260.6800000000003," So Mr. Bulbasaur, you may say."
3260.68,3261.68, Band-in-Bee.
3261.68,3263.16, This is going to be out soon.
3263.16,3265.8799999999997," I mean, even when we ran the preview, this is the first public beta."
3265.8799999999997,3266.9199999999996, It's going to be in October.
3266.9199999999996,3267.9199999999996, So cool.
3267.9199999999996,3270.12, Last I heard from David Lyon on the team.

3272.08,3273.08, Awesome.
3273.08,3274.48, Here's your answer.
3274.48,3275.48, Are we done?
3275.48,3277.48, Do we want to do a time for one more?
3277.48,3280.64," Well, this one, that one at, there's one more."
3280.64,3281.64, It's four minutes.
3281.64,3282.64, I like that.
3282.64,3283.64, But it's going for the hour.
3283.64,3284.64, Okay.
3284.64,3285.64, But we got it.
3285.64,3287.04," So we got to do this in just a few minutes, even though it's like a six part"
3287.04,3288.04, question.
3288.04,3289.04, Hopefully we'll wrap it up.
3289.04,3292.16, And we're actually getting close to the battery on this laptop.
3292.16,3293.6," Oh, it's going to be better."
3293.6,3294.6, You just cut.
3294.6,3295.6, I'll read that.
3295.6,3300.08," Adam Ninja, gamer, Borman asks, how do you feel about professional?"
3300.08,3301.08, Yes.
3301.08,3302.08, And it's called gaming.
3302.08,3303.92, Is it a legitimate career?
3303.92,3307.88, Do you think pro gamers can be called?
3307.88,3311.04, That woulda says I would get to put my glasses on.

3320.2000000000003,3323.04," You, you, you, you, you, Mr."
3323.04,3324.88, All that just to get to this fatality.
