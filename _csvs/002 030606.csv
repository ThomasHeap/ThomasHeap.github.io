0.0,11.0," Hello, welcome to the second computer gaming world podcast. I would say the second weekly podcast, but we've already blown that haven't we haven't we kids?"
11.0,13.0, But we're not going to do that anymore.
13.0,16.0," Yeah, don't let it happen again."
16.0,25.0," I have sitting with me three esteemed computer gaming world editors, and I will let them introduce themselves starting with user."
25.0,27.0, Ryan Scott reviews editor.
28.0,29.0, I'm a Christmas albator.
29.0,31.0, It's a fantasy.
31.0,32.0, Not a bad.
32.0,34.0," Oh, I'm a good one."
34.0,35.0, Hi.
35.0,38.0, We're just we're just kidding.
38.0,39.0, Where are the whack?
39.0,40.0, You know what?
40.0,42.0," This is actually Kristen, the managing out of there."
42.0,43.0, Kristen South or?
43.0,44.0, And this is actually Darren.
44.0,45.0, Hi.
45.0,46.0, The jerk.
46.0,47.0, Are you guys done now?
47.0,48.0," Yeah, we're done."
48.0,49.0, Sorry.
49.0,50.0, Are you done fooling around?
50.0,52.0, This is serious business.
52.0,56.0," Okay, so there's a lot to talk about, but what I want to talk about is"
56.0,61.0, we've been getting a lot of mail from our last issue.
61.0,63.0, Because of something we didn't do.
63.0,66.0, Usually we get mail for things we did do that they don't like.
66.0,69.0, This time it was something we didn't do and they don't like that either.
69.0,74.0, So apparently there's nothing we can do or not do that will make some people happy.
74.0,81.0, What we didn't do this time was we didn't do a games of the year feature.
81.0,85.0, We actually weren't the only zif davis magazine not to do that by the way.
85.0,89.0, But we were the only ones who drew attention to that fact as we tend to do that.
89.0,90.0, And there lies the rub.
90.0,93.0, And here we are drawing even more attention to it.
93.0,96.0, So if you weren't mad before and as your chance to be mad.
96.0,97.0, Really if you just talk.
97.0,102.0," If you didn't know, we didn't do a games of the year story for 2005."
102.0,105.0, We had very specific reasons why we didn't do it.
105.0,110.0," Some of which I tried to communicate in the editorial, but I may or may not have done a good job on that."
110.0,116.0, I'm going to read you what this one guy wrote except I have to be able to see through my glasses.
116.0,118.0, Otherwise I can't because I'm old.
118.0,119.0, You know what?
119.0,123.0, This is one of those moments I really wish we were doing a video at C-C.
123.0,126.0, Something very Jerry Lewis like.
126.0,128.0, Fighting the wires and the glasses.
128.0,129.0, Okay.
129.0,132.0, Through my glasses I may able to read this.
132.0,134.0, This came from a reader.
134.0,136.0, Should we name his name?
137.0,141.0, Mr. X wrote to us.
141.0,143.0, These are just excerpts.
143.0,148.0," Contrary to just lead editorial, I haven't read 250 other best of articles."
148.0,151.0," Nor have I read 25, nor even 2.5."
151.0,154.0," Silly me, I was waiting for yours."
154.0,155.0, Why?
155.0,162.0," As you are also fond of pointing out, yours is the best gaming mag in the industry, which is why I've been a reader for ten years."
162.0,165.0," I know when you guys give an award, it really means something."
165.0,173.0," So why would I go buy another mags in or scour the internet for a best of list, produced by some mis-inthropic kid that I don't know and can't trust?"
173.0,175.0, One more thing.
175.0,185.0," By the way, how dare you get two quote, bored, which is a line I used in my editorial, to write about the best things that happened in an above average year for a great hobby."
185.0,192.0," I don't know if it's arrogance or apathy, but either way maybe you need to make way for someone who cares."
192.0,193.0, Ouch.
193.0,196.0, Thanks for dropping the ball this year.
196.0,197.0, Okay.
197.0,200.0," Jeff, I don't think that guy's a member of your fan club anymore."
200.0,202.0," First of all, you're welcome."
202.0,204.0," Yeah, you're welcome."
204.0,207.0, We're happy to drop the ball for you.
207.0,209.0, What do we think about that?
209.0,211.0, Do we have any regrets?
211.0,220.0," You know, I don't, but maybe I don't understand what people are using best of lists for at the end of a year."
220.0,228.0," You know, I think in the past when there were literally more games than you could get your head around."
228.0,235.0," That made it a little bit more sense to me, because I think he also mentions in the letter the fact that he didn't have time to play that many games this year."
235.0,236.0, Right.
236.0,239.0, That he only had time to finish four games or something.
239.0,240.0, Right.
240.0,249.0," But you know, part of the reason that we decided not to do that feature is that we really were kind of tripping over ourselves and coming up with the same five or six or seven games that were kind of falling into all the category."
249.0,255.0," So, you know, I wish he would have explained to me exactly what he was going to do with this list that we didn't give him."
255.0,260.0," So basically, I mean, you think you might need like more of a shopping list kind of things like, I mean, is that what people are using it for?"
260.0,266.0," If that's what people want to know, you know, what to pick out of the bargain bin, then that's different."
266.0,268.0," But, but I don't really feel like that's what he's saying."
268.0,273.0, I've got not sworn for just a railing as a fact we did something different or something.
273.0,277.0," I think some people just want like the official confirmation from, you know, an official source."
277.0,289.0," You know, here's these games deserve some kind of kudos and they deserve it from you guys because you, you know, are an authority."
289.0,293.0," Yeah, sure about a point of view."
293.0,295.0," Yeah, it's."
295.0,303.0," Which I sympathize with, but you know, maybe I didn't make it clear in our in our in the editorial why we did what we did."
303.0,313.0, And people are very much centering on the word board. He's like the third or fourth or fifth letter to mention that and I probably shouldn't have used that word because I didn't mean that we were bored.
313.0,318.0, Either by the games or by the idea of.
318.0,323.0," Well, we were bored by the idea of doing that or that's because we were in a meeting for four hours about it."
323.0,326.0," That would boring anybody, right."
326.0,337.0," But I think it was, I think that what we were really struggling with there was at the time that we were making that list."
337.0,340.0, We were.
340.0,344.0, We ourselves had already read God knows how many less ourselves.
344.0,348.0, We'd been faced with best of the year after best of the year article.
348.0,355.0," And when you're working on a monthly magazine, you know, at the point when we're talking about making our list and we've already read everybody else's."
355.0,359.0, And we know the list isn't going to be online for six more weeks.
359.0,366.0," You start having a feeling of futility a little bit like well, who's really going to care in March or April."
366.0,369.0, Apparently a lot of people care.
369.0,371.0, Apparently a lot of people care.
371.0,376.0," Well, so it seems to me that people want to know what would have been on our list."
376.0,377.0, So.
377.0,378.0, So what is our list?
378.0,379.0," Well, what have been on our list?"
379.0,380.0," Well, you know, we did talk."
380.0,382.0," We did actually have a game of the year, didn't we?"
382.0,384.0," Well, we got it down."
384.0,385.0, We got it down to two.
385.0,386.0, We got it down to two.
386.0,387.0, We got it down to one.
387.0,388.0, We got it down to one.
388.0,389.0, Now.
389.0,390.0, Good.
390.0,391.0, No.
391.0,392.0," Well, you just love it."
392.0,395.0, We got it down to two guild wars.
395.0,396.0, Mm-hmm.
396.0,398.0," And to battlefield two, right?"
398.0,399.0, Mm-hmm.
399.0,400.0, Yeah.
400.0,401.0, That was the neck and neck fight.
401.0,402.0, Right.
402.0,404.0, Both incredibly worthy games.
404.0,407.0, I would say both very different games.
407.0,412.0, And both games that different people on stuff had spent varying amounts of time playing.
412.0,415.0," In fact, if I recall, we were split almost right down the middle."
415.0,419.0," Half the staff had played a lot of guild wars, and half the staff had played a lot of battlefield"
419.0,420.0, two.
420.0,421.0, Mm-hmm.
421.0,424.0, And that was why part of the reason why we were struggling.
424.0,425.0, Right.
425.0,429.0," You know, I think the point you made earlier is totally true, though, in terms of like the number"
429.0,434.0," of games, like back if I can play the old man card here, back in the in the in the in the in the"
434.0,441.0," in the old days of CGW, when there were so many releases, you know, it it seems like a useful exercise because"
441.0,448.0," because if there were 50 real-time strategy games, you know, it it made more sense to narrow"
448.0,453.0," down to one or two, as opposed to if there's only two released this year."
453.0,454.0, Right.
454.0,455.0," Well, one of them's going to win, right?"
455.0,456.0, Yeah.
456.0,457.0, Right.
457.0,458.0, And how many of venture games were mentioning even?
458.0,459.0, Right.
459.0,460.0, Right.
460.0,461.0, Indigo prophecy won.
461.0,462.0, Right.
462.0,465.0, Art venture game of the year that we didn't pass out because there weren't any others.
465.0,466.0, Right.
466.0,470.0," Well, there weren't any others that we felt were even, you know, close."
470.0,473.0, It had no competition.
473.0,478.0," But, but there were other, you know, there were other more highly contested categories."
478.0,479.0, Right.
479.0,480.0, The shooter category.
480.0,482.0, Very contested.
482.0,484.0, We had Call of Duty 2.
484.0,486.0, Fear.
486.0,487.0, What else was on there?
487.0,488.0, Serious Sam.
488.0,489.0," Well, that really."
489.0,491.0, Serious Sam was up for an award.
491.0,492.0, Brother's an arms brothers and arms.
492.0,493.0, And actually the two brothers.
493.0,494.0, That's right.
494.0,497.0, They should they should get some kind of metal somewhere for the fact they produced a game
498.0,499.0, at its sequel in the same year.
499.0,501.0, And the same year in both were awesome.
501.0,502.0, Yeah.
502.0,504.0, I think did Call of Duty 2 end up winning?
504.0,507.0, I think that was actually another one where we deadlocked.
507.0,508.0, Where we deadlocked.
508.0,509.0, Yeah.
509.0,512.0," Well, we deadlocked because Ryan does the play shooters."
512.0,514.0, So he did a lot of it.
514.0,518.0, And I was feeling bustling for brothers and arms.
518.0,519.0, That's right.
519.0,524.0," Actually, you know, that fact is, you know, is kind of crucial to the whole awards thing."
524.0,526.0," I mean, the fact that Ryan doesn't play shooters."
526.0,531.0," And I think that's Sean that's like all he plays, which was a big reason why we had the battlefield to"
531.0,533.0," Guild Wars deadlock, right?"
533.0,540.0," And I thought, because Sean's not here, I feel like it bears mentioning that I'm like 90% sure that he chose Call of Duty 2 as his."
540.0,541.0, They're he did.
541.0,543.0," Well, always a single player shooter."
543.0,544.0, That's right.
544.0,545.0, That's right.
545.0,546.0, Multiplayer battlefield 2 just walked away.
546.0,547.0, Right.
547.0,548.0, What else was there?
548.0,552.0," But yeah, Sean Sean was definitely lobbying for Call of Duty 2."
552.0,555.0, I think my game of the year was pulled of warcraft again.
556.0,559.0," You know, I was thinking about it this morning."
559.0,568.0," I was thinking if we keep doing awards, so in years to come, like maybe that is something that actually could really happen."
568.0,574.0," That like, you know, if these games, if we if more and more games end up just being, you know,"
574.0,581.0," living forever and we're seeing less new single player titles, maybe that does happen, right?"
582.0,594.0," I don't I mean, you know, we talked about what we talked about doing instead, and I'd be real curious to see what people thought of this was something similar, but maybe just not handing out awards per se."
594.0,598.0," Something that looks more like, you know, a year and review kind of thing."
598.0,605.0," Yeah, like a more in depth, like at the games over the course of the past year that we really liked that we thought were, you know,"
605.0,610.0," were demonstrating some sort of innovation that we want, you know, either we're going to see more of in the future."
610.0,616.0," We wanted to see more of in the future, and you know, I wonder if people would have felt any better if we had named games."
616.0,628.0," Right. Well, the true facts, you know, I mean, if we're just airing dirty laundry here, is that once we realize that that story was of just having pages of handing out awards that we felt that was pass A."
628.0,631.0, What we had wanted to do instead was do what you're talking about.
631.0,639.0," We had wanted to do like best trends, things like that, but the problem was we were a few days away from finishing the magazine and kind of didn't get that together."
639.0,644.0, But you're really wanted some space to talk about Darwinia. I have seen them all.
644.0,653.0," Oh, yeah, I wanted to I get another like indie game that no one really talked about. I think like was one of the, like dark horses of last year that no one."
653.0,655.0, No one actually played was probably the best game out there.
655.0,663.0," I wanted that would be like the real great point of doing an article like this is to, is to champion games that I mean, do we really need to get battlefield to an award?"
663.0,668.0," You know, I mean, if it deserved it, yes, but I mean, they don't need more sales."
668.0,674.0," Yeah, there was no surprise. Everybody, everybody I think knew that game by then. Everybody knew that was a really good game."
674.0,677.0, But the pinpoint people to a Darwinia.
677.0,685.0," Yeah. I think that other part of the problem is I guess is the nature of the fact that you know, you brought up earlier Jeff that, you know, our magazine comes out March April and it's a way after the fact."
685.0,692.0," And we have to wait that long because you know, all the, all the, every game starts to shove out the dark the last second December 24th."
692.0,693.0, Yeah.
693.0,696.0, And if only we could do it sooner or so. It actually was more relevant. Yeah.
696.0,704.0," Yeah. What's interesting to me is like most of the people writing other people who who said like, well, I didn't read 20 other articles or I didn't see any game sites."
704.0,708.0," I mean, we assume now that all our readers are going to gaming websites."
708.0,713.0," Well, because we have, because we have a study that tells us that 99% of them have broad effects."
713.0,717.0," Of course, they're not good gaming websites. And we're wasting our time here this morning."
717.0,720.0, Just a back upstairs and work on our magazine.
721.0,730.0," Well, all right. So since we didn't have a chance to do that article in the, in the magazine, I suppose we should talk about it right here."
730.0,731.0, We could do that. Yeah.
731.0,734.0, Me and our own personal games of the year. Yeah.
734.0,743.0," Or, or, you know, I mean, they're on the starting talk a little bit about Darwinia. Like, what, you know, sorry. I don't mean suddenly host the show for a time."
743.0,744.0, You host a way.
744.0,747.0," But I mean, what was it about that game that you thought was so great?"
747.0,753.0," Well, I mean, approve that you don't need a big budget for starters. I mean, the game is 50, 50 megs roughly."
753.0,758.0," And, and it has the, it's, the best way to describe it's kind of like, tron lemmings."
758.0,762.0," And an old, old school game called Cannon Fatter. And it blends action and strategy."
762.0,771.0," And it doesn't look like anything else out there. And it doesn't rely your high end graphics card or super realistic graphics. It's very, it's very art style-ized."
771.0,772.0, Was this a downloadable?
772.0,773.0, Yeah.
773.0,775.0, Yeah. And it's actually being offered through Steam now.
775.0,779.0, So how else could you get it? Do you happen to know that URL?
779.0,783.0," Um, I think I think it was an introversion.co.uk."
783.0,786.0," I mean, it basically, it's a British. It was a British site. You could just order it through that."
786.0,793.0," But since it's available through Steam now, that's pretty much the steam or or Googleable. I would thank pretty much."
793.0,794.0, Yeah.
794.0,801.0," I mean, that's just one of many games. And that, this year, that kind of like fell into the radar because it didn't have a big budget behind it."
802.0,808.0," Ryan, you were like crazy for Guild Wars. You still are still crazy for Guild Wars."
808.0,810.0," Um, they're still playing it."
810.0,813.54," Not as much as I was before, but I'm an off-"
813.54,816.0, How many mice have you broken at this point playing that game?
816.0,818.0, Just the one. Okay.
818.0,821.0," Okay. For the record, I've never actually seen anybody get that angry at a game before."
821.0,828.0," Even myself and the leads. No, myself included. I broke in keyboards, but Ryan just like he used to turn into break that mouse."
828.0,830.0, Just how passionate I was for that game.
832.0,836.0," Well, so other than breaking a mouse."
836.0,839.0, What was good about the game?
839.0,843.0, Why didn't you break the mouse? What specifically made you mad at that?
843.0,847.0, Tell us what was happening in Ryan's world at that moment.
847.0,854.0, It was some mission in the first part of the game that I was trying to solo with a bunch of NPC characters.
854.0,860.0, And I kept getting killed at the same point. Probably like seven or eight times in a row.
860.0,865.0," So instead of breaking your mouse, maybe you should have just formed a group."
865.0,867.0," Yeah, probably."
867.0,870.0, It's not funny. It's like the same thing.
870.0,877.0," Every game for all time, like every sort of, you know, that's the worst thing that can ever happen to you as you just get stuck."
877.0,880.0, You keep dying over and over and over and over in the same place.
880.0,881.0, I get more mad and more mad.
881.0,882.0, Yeah.
882.0,883.0, That's not funny.
883.0,887.0, I don't like being in groups and even those strangely enough.
887.0,889.0, Is that like the point?
889.0,892.0," Well, I don't like it when I'm forced into doing that though."
892.0,895.0," No, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't be in the shadows online for you, my friend."
895.0,896.0, Yeah.
896.0,898.0, Group or die.
898.0,899.0, Yeah.
899.0,902.0, But Guild Wars. You could kind of or most of the game.
902.0,908.0, You could sort of get through it with just the NPCs if you didn't want to deal with other players who.
908.0,909.0, If if.
909.0,910.0, Okay.
910.0,914.0, Let me ask you this if if Guild Wars was single player then.
914.0,915.0, Would you like it as much?
915.0,918.0, I think it's still the fun game.
918.0,921.68, I mean you can almost see it as a single player game if you want to since it's got
921.68,927.2, I mean all the different missions follow like this logical story progression and
927.2,932.48, you don't really even have to deal with other players if you don't want to do that
932.48,935.52, Do you like the fact that that they're there though?
935.52,942.56, Yeah well it's kind of I mean most of it is kind of like a single player game with these
942.56,948.9599999999999, these towns spread out through the map that are pretty much sort of like the oblo chat room sort of
948.9599999999999,956.16, things I'm asking because I feel like there's some weird phenomenon about like liking to
956.16,961.04, so like I know this is true of me and I've talked to other people where they like to play the
961.04,965.3599999999999, MMOs just because they know those other people are there but they don't really want to talk to
965.3599999999999,970.7199999999999, them or group with that. That's why I don't play MMOs at all. I kind of wonder if I should have tried
970.72,977.12, guild wars like I don't like the idea of having to to tie my gaming experience to everybody
977.12,981.84, else there that actually really bug me like but you don't have to. Gaming is time I actually
981.84,987.52, get to spend by myself kind of you know and less I'm choosing to play you know co-op with
987.52,993.36, somebody or you know like it's like actively play and if I'm doing that it's sort of like
993.36,996.5600000000001, I want that person to be in the room so we can yell at each other for you know.
996.56,1002.16, That's what makes me worry about like D&D online's ultimate ability to survive. Right because they
1002.16,1007.8399999999999, tied that so much into a grouping experience which if you're into that that's cool but what if you
1007.8399999999999,1013.3599999999999, just wanted yeah get an hour to yourself. I just hear so many people talk about like yeah and then we
1013.3599999999999,1019.3599999999999, all arrange to you know meet up Friday night and you know complete this question together or whatever
1019.3599999999999,1025.6, it's like I don't know. Sometimes that can be the most fun most of the the best most memorable
1025.6799999999998,1030.9599999999998, gaming experiences I've ever had have been that kind of situation to have been. Were you bothering
1030.9599999999998,1035.84," virtually or you gathering virtually? Yeah, totally great because those are usually like the"
1035.84,1040.08, big laugh out loud moments because it's just what other people are doing it's so unpredictable
1040.48,1046.08, but I have to say even though I'm saying that my my default though is to not want to play with other
1046.08,1051.52, people. I mean if I'm playing wow and I'm by myself and I'm just leveling and doing stuff and then
1051.52,1055.28, some one of my friends comes online and starts talking to me my just reaction is like the
1056.96,1062.4, cool way. I'll sort of break down and then go have fun with them but it first of my god damn it
1062.4,1066.48, I was by myself and having a good time. Well we just saw a game the other day actually that has
1066.48,1071.12, an interesting way of doing that you were in the room when we looked at son which is the new game
1071.12,1075.92, from websen the guys were doing hoxley. Right. They're at before hoxley's released they're actually
1075.92,1080.08, going to bring over this it's bringing over from Korea this other game called son it's
1080.1599999999999,1086.56, soul of the ultimate nation right that has this whole well you may be able to explain it better than
1086.56,1091.52, maybe because you play on it was and I don't really but they basically like made it so that you can
1091.52,1097.12, level grind you know on your like on your own if you want to right well it's sort of like you can
1097.12,1102.32, be in your own instances doing your own thing because you can lock the map like once you clear
1102.32,1106.8, a mission you can actually then go back and play within the map but you can set these parameters
1106.8,1111.36, so that no one else can come into the map over there right it's kind of like deablo in a way that
1111.36,1117.04, we've even guild war size opposed. And can you do that guild war's too? Yeah sure yeah I can
1117.04,1121.36, like go into your own well the maps when you when you go out on an adventure map with a group of people
1121.36,1126.3999999999999, they're all they're all instance so it's it's kind of like it's just for you but are the instances
1126.3999999999999,1131.52, scalable they are yeah I mean they'll add more more creatures more difficulty to it
1132.48,1139.6, generally no no uh uh could have sworn in one of the early areas like beyond the gate and that first
1139.6,1143.52, area before you even like I don't like zero pretty serring that always seem to get a lot tough
1143.52,1147.92, and when I had more people with me really or maybe just they were all idiots running toward the
1147.92,1153.2, uh the enemies just not even thinking it allowed not not that I've noticed and you guys are going to
1153.2,1160.8799999999999, get some angry email now yeah somebody got it wrong probably me well I think I think actually it's
1160.88,1163.2800000000002, probably more the you know what now that I think about it was probably more the case of like I was
1163.2800000000002,1167.0400000000002, playing with guys who wouldn't listen and that's the problem with playing with other people sometimes
1167.0400000000002,1170.4, well it's fun when it's people you know like you know they know what they're doing yeah you got a
1170.4,1172.96, weirdo you got a weirdo you got a weirdo mouth though that's the annoying part you have to
1172.96,1177.92, you have to keep to go through that it's like looking for new friends I hate that yeah no it's hard
1177.92,1184.5600000000002, it I hate people what we all do that's why we're in this business that's why we play game
1184.5600000000002,1189.7600000000002, we hate socializing so it's a weird thing that to go online and have that be like part of your
1189.84,1197.44, experience and all these MMOs as as solvable as they make it like wow my main guys is 53 now
1197.44,1202.96, and I've soled almost all the way but the the the negative of that is like the cool loot is all
1202.96,1207.76, stuff I would have had to be in groups and do the dungeons to get it's not being penalized is another
1207.76,1211.36, part of it the fact like I mean you can just drive like you just want to hang out play for a little bit
1211.36,1215.2, and get off the nature a lot of these games where you get all the cool loot requires you spending
1215.2,1218.8799999999999, like two or three hours at a time and like if you if you leave someone else they're everyone else
1218.96,1223.92, totally host yes yeah that's a huge thing yeah that's a really good point I mean if you're
1223.92,1230.3200000000002, if you're living in a situation where you have a family for example you know I mean it can be tough
1230.3200000000002,1235.68, to go like those there have been times when I've been in an instance dungeon in World Warcraft
1235.68,1241.68, and it'll be like a two or three hour thing and then my wife will you know say it's time for dinner
1241.68,1246.4, and I can yell from the office and say I'm in the middle of a dungeon you know but
1247.3600000000001,1252.88, but the her you know it's high I've just cooked you your food and it's it's time to eat now and you know
1252.88,1259.52, and then I'll say like listen I can't be rude to these people I'm you know I'm the only warlock in this
1259.52,1265.76, group and they're gonna die if I don't stay and then she says I'm the only wife you have pretty much
1265.76,1270.16, yeah it's so wrong about that yeah so who the hell are these people that you're choosing
1270.16,1277.44, over me who just cooked you your dinner but it's a really weird dynamic because it's as right as she is
1278.88,1283.8400000000001, as right as she is it's kind of true because those people are all gonna go one an ass but if I log out
1283.8400000000001,1289.76, but honey they get she they give me a soul stone yeah I mean so they're not gonna make you sleep on the couch
1290.5600000000002,1295.44, but there is this weird social contract if like if you go if you commit to going in this dungeon
1295.6000000000001,1301.6000000000001, you're supposed to stay you're not supposed to bail out so kind of going back to the
1301.6000000000001,1306.48, what the conversation we started here on game in the years stuff you know when we talked about
1306.48,1310.8, killed wars in battlefield two one of the conversations that came up around those two was the fact
1310.8,1317.28, that even though battlefield two really isn't an MMO technically it kind of skates the edge yeah
1317.28,1321.44, and like when you think about the stuff you're talking about now think about what it's like a back game
1321.76,1328.3200000000002, right right right if you're part of a squad and oh my god the whole plan right yeah yeah I mean it's
1328.3200000000002,1334.4, it's really true I mean so and that game I don't know can you solo battlefield two
1334.4,1339.1200000000001, well you could play offline with the bots but that really is just a waste of time yeah
1339.1200000000001,1343.76, oh we ever did but we all got a field to use jump around by the pool anyway
1344.4,1348.24, right well who was trying to fly the copter was that he was like not gonna be right I was mean
1349.04,1357.2, oh that was I mean I mean he's down and he's down so was side mission and he and the other big
1357.2,1363.92, favorite games of 2005 people want to mention I loved need for speed most wanted in fact that was
1363.92,1368.8, another one of the conversations was about raising game of the era because need for speed most wanted
1368.8,1374.56, and it was a GTR we're both on the list and I made the argument that I didn't think you pair those two
1375.04,1379.76, because one is more Sam one's a Sam you absolutely can and then there's like these weird other
1379.76,1384.3999999999999, like games like trackmania right that we're like you know it's kind of like virtual hot wheels
1384.3999999999999,1388.48, we just building your own choices only raising game fan in the world who doesn't like track
1388.48,1393.04, media I don't those games I think I don't like that I'm so not into those games well
1393.04,1397.12, it'll be I don't I'm not into it I'm not into the game because I mean actually I'm lazy
1397.12,1402.56, and requires me working in building a yeah I guess that's part of it but I think for those out there
1402.72,1406.56, who really are into like you know level design stuff we're getting a lot out of it that's true
1406.56,1411.76, that's really the appeal of that game that the track design as opposed to that absolutely
1411.76,1418.56, looped elups and you know crazy stuff it's funny that's been an ongoing problem forever with
1418.56,1425.2, the arcade racers versus the same racers another a few were in few of each coming out each here you know
1425.2,1430.8799999999999, or each yeah each here I think we used to divide them up at CG in CGW we would have like racing
1430.88,1435.6000000000001, game in the air but then we would have sim of the year and the sim would include racing game race
1435.6000000000001,1441.92, it would include auto games and playing games. Oh it's interesting. Well I loved me knee for speed
1441.92,1447.44, most wanted that was probably one of my favorite games of last year really I really like to it got
1447.44,1452.64, I don't know how far you played through the game. Yeah pretty far. It got really hard really hard
1452.64,1456.0, as you were working your way up the blacklist and I love that I thought that was great because racing
1456.24,1462.08, games I mean I wrote the review of that game but you know after like they can only be like one or two
1462.08,1467.04, or maybe three track ponies like it's a racing game you know but I thought they did a good job of
1467.04,1471.12, scaling the difficulty of that game to actually keep me pretty interested. Yeah I was under that game.
1471.12,1475.6, Yeah I think I was the open world and the ability just kind of go and pick wherever you're going to
1475.6,1479.44, drive and just give you all these different objectives so you didn't feel like locked into I think the
1479.44,1484.64, previous games that I played in review it was just a very small slice of city that was just cut up
1484.72,1489.2800000000002, different ways and you knew exactly everything inside of five minutes. Right. Yeah I thought I mean
1489.2800000000002,1495.0400000000002, I loved the cop chase as I thought that was really fun. I would just do the cop chase so I wouldn't
1495.0400000000002,1499.76, even bother with the game. I can totally see that like just the whole the way they set that up that
1499.76,1504.72, you got more you know your points went up the longer you kept the cops in the chase and you didn't
1504.72,1509.5200000000002, get caught like that was a real adrenaline rush and I was I was way into that. It was very
1509.6,1513.84, smokey in the band it. Yeah I had to and that and you know what I mean I feel like this about most racing
1513.84,1519.04, games. I like that you can kind of pick them up and put them down for a while and then go back to them and
1519.04,1523.84, you're not you know you don't feel like there's a new learning curve like they're very easy to sort of
1524.32,1530.48, jump into and out of pretty fast. Wonderful. I'm going to put the burnout games to the PC. Man they won't
1530.48,1534.8799999999999, find I doubt it but they won't I mean I've actually they come through the opposite couple times most recently
1534.88,1540.96, to show off black before release and I said one question one question alone where's the PC?
1542.0,1547.68, Yeah they're kind of not into the game. Yeah I always joke with those guys whenever they come in town.
1547.68,1553.44, Yeah it's too bad. Need for speed to me it just I mean I actually never even
1553.44,1557.68, installed it to be honest because for me it just I couldn't get over the like I've played
1557.68,1563.3600000000001, need for speed. Like I think it's sort of a problem with franchises like that sometime. Yeah I mean I
1563.4399999999998,1567.4399999999998, was sure how I was going to feel about it because I had just you know need for speed underground
1567.4399999999998,1572.7199999999998, wasn't that long ago. Right. But well now I think the question will be the next one this for me
1572.7199999999998,1577.12, worked out okay because they were the copchases there were some new stuff you know the next iteration
1577.12,1580.9599999999998, and I assume there will be a next. Yeah wait wait until this Christmas the next install.
1580.9599999999998,1585.76, I mean what are they going to do that? Then then I may be taking the limit of my interest. Well there
1585.76,1590.1599999999999, is one thing they can bring back that they did and I think was way long ago hopper suit I think it was.
1590.24,1594.5600000000002, Yeah where you could actually do multiplayer and you could be the cop or the guy doing the chasing
1594.5600000000002,1598.4, so that they brought that back that would be pretty cool. That was a great game. That was a lot
1598.4,1602.24, of fun. I think that was the last one I played but you know you're right it might just be after
1602.24,1608.4, you place a certain many. Yeah you hear over. Yeah but I have to find something to do with my
1608.4,1614.16, gaming time or what. Or got for me there's new franchise. Yeah but again you know racing games
1615.28,1619.92, you know there's only so many really different things you can do with with a racing game so
1620.24,1625.52, right. I don't know. I'm trying to get into adventure games right now. There's some amazing ones.
1625.52,1628.5600000000002, In the go prophecy. That was the one you know I've traditionally
1629.8400000000001,1633.44, kind of railed against being given a adventure games to review because I feel like
1634.4,1638.48, they've been kind of pigeonholed a little bit as like games that girls play and I have
1638.48,1644.96, who sew not into that and I was never into like Mr. any of that stuff. But in the go prophecy
1645.3600000000001,1649.52, I mean I love the Grim Fan Dango but in the go prophecy maybe feel a little bit better about
1649.6,1654.24, playing adventure games again. They'd be feel like it wasn't you know they weren't that wasn't
1654.24,1658.8799999999999, peg does like a girl game and I was that's a really interesting point I never thought about that.
1658.8799999999999,1664.8, Really that the adventure games quite often in C.D.W. not just now but years past those are
1664.8,1669.52, off in the ones the women or the girls review. My very first game that I was ever offered
1669.52,1673.84, when I started to work for C.D.W. was an adventure game and I said no. Which I said I wouldn't do
1673.84,1678.8799999999999, it's because we know you're not going to have to shoot things and race things. I love shooting and
1678.96,1686.16, racing and you've always had the same time. Auto sold. Auto sold. I'm so excited for it. Yeah.
1686.8000000000002,1690.96, And also I think maybe we think that you ladies are better at the logic puzzles than us.
1692.0800000000002,1695.2800000000002, Surely you're over that by now. I have expanded a couple of years working with me.
1695.2800000000002,1700.96, But yeah pretty much over that. Come on. Let me see Monster blow up.
1701.8400000000001,1707.2, Even when like when Ubisoft is doing a new misgame they always kind of target it and women
1707.28,1712.0800000000002, like they've painted whole with themselves. So it's not your staff. The trees have an intelligent
1712.0800000000002,1716.72, story and just putting it together smartly. I mean within the go prophecy it actually felt at times
1716.72,1721.52, I mean as cliched as the sound is like watching an episode of 24 or an angel horror or something and
1722.56,1727.6000000000001, the action sequences. I mean the fact that they let you basically play the cutscenes.
1727.6000000000001,1731.8400000000001, Yeah. Instead of just saying they're passively watching action unfold. Kind of drags you further
1731.8400000000001,1736.96, into the story. To me the production of that game just the split screen stuff. Totally just phenomenal.
1737.04,1742.8, Because it's not those games are not about like crazy graphics. They're not about and it's funny because
1743.52,1748.08, you know there's another adventure game that I'm previewing for this month that's coming up
1748.08,1752.08, that I would mention here because I don't want to tip our hand. But you know we got the screens
1752.08,1754.96, in for it and when you just see the screenshots of a game like that it's like
1755.76,1758.4, you sort of it sort of gives you pause because it doesn't look like
1760.24,1764.32, a bunch of big splashy stuff on the screen. But yeah in the go prophecy I thought did a really good job
1764.3999999999999,1769.2, of making it look you know really interesting without throwing a ton of polygons.
1769.2,1772.0, You know actually another game that has a lot of potential for that if you haven't checked it out yet
1772.0,1777.28, it has dreamfall. Oh yeah. I think that that could be another really quality one along the
1777.28,1781.4399999999998, same lines as a medical prophecy. The dream falls to the sequel to uh longest journey long
1781.4399999999998,1785.28, a straight right right right. Right right. A great game. That was a brilliant game.
1785.28,1790.08, Yeah I mean it's it'll be interesting to see. I mean somebody made the argument to me that
1791.04,1795.76, that maybe the reason there's a little I mean like Sam and the new Sam and Max is coming and
1795.76,1800.08, the maybe there's a little bit of what appears to be a random song in the adventure game genre
1800.08,1807.12, is just that gamers want smarter stuff to do you know and that that's sort of easy genre to
1807.12,1814.24, make smart smart our puzzles. Right well we've seen a lot of the a lot of adventure game
1814.24,1819.36, things in the past get incorporated even into our shooters and action game right like half life
1819.4399999999998,1825.12, too and you know that's well sort of have a logic puzzle based elements to their game.
1825.12,1830.7199999999998, A good example be a vampire bloodlines that actually had like you know a lot of adventure elements
1830.7199999999998,1836.4799999999998, even like multiple choice conversation questions and right RPG stability it's interesting
1836.4799999999998,1840.6399999999999, seeing how like while the adventure genre and RPG genre are pretty much fallen by the way so they're
1840.6399999999999,1845.52, kind of just kind of blending into everything else. Well which is and this is probably a top and
1845.52,1851.2, for another podcast by now to be comparison. Well I was going to tie it back in to our original
1851.2,1856.08, conversation but gave it here which is that you know I think there's a good argument to me made
1856.08,1861.36, that the concept of genres is pretty much going away. Right you know I mean we're back to see a
1861.36,1866.96, lot of different games that talk about getting some shooter in your RPG and etc and getting some
1866.96,1871.76, action in your you know so I would venture guess that by the end of this year it's going to be
1871.76,1878.64, really hard to do as genre by genre. Yeah I mean we're able to keep the MMOs separate and now you're
1878.64,1883.36, right you know what is that. You know actually thinking back now I do remember like that was part
1883.36,1888.56, of our debates when we were coming up with the awards because like guild wars. Well guild wars is kind
1888.56,1894.96, of like you know a card game or action based and then we were debating about whether to even classify
1895.04,1904.16, it in a mow. True very true. So. Okay so yeah sorry we'll we'll we're all during that my
1904.16,1910.48, moment there. Oh well I was not paying attention I'm sorry we were talking and I was
1910.48,1919.76, based on it. Thank you. Come on we got we got Scott the sanded and he was like shaken his head
1920.24,1926.8799999999999, he's like dear god. So before we sign after there's one game that has a come out yet so
1926.8799999999999,1930.8, none of us are playing yet but I'm curious to get the response because it goes to a little bit of what
1930.8,1936.96, we're talking about here in a few weeks we're going to see the release of oblivion. The third
1936.96,1944.0, third elder scrolls game third fourth elder scroll games pardon me. We had arena dagger fall marowind
1944.0,1951.04, and now oblivion. Now that is a single player RPG that is just defiantly old school single player
1951.04,1958.4, there's no online you know MMO component to that game and I'm wondering if you guys are looking
1958.4,1966.48, for to that game or not. Right. Ryan. Sure. You don't have to say yes it's not true.
1966.48,1973.28, eloquent as ever. I didn't really get into morrow in so much and you're into those kinds of games
1973.28,1979.84, fire call like you're you like your RPGs don't you? You're kind of all about the fay.
1982.48,1990.56, He brandishes his sword mightily. He disdainful lightning vote. This coming from a no more lot.
1991.12,1998.32, Hey level 53. Sorry I mean are you not into RPGs? I thought I'm making that up.
1999.2,2004.24, I used to be quite a bit not so much in the last couple years.
2004.24,2009.76, Okay. They're kind of like I am making that up because I've really only known you for a couple
2009.76,2017.6799999999998, of years. I mean more like NMOs single player RPGs are a little too time consuming
2019.04,2023.04, paranah. That's always been sort of a thing about this game. Right. The danger.
2023.52,2027.68, Yeah. I mean what's the joke if they have they call it like massively single player? Right.
2027.68,2033.44, And man is that ever true. I mean I remember trying to finish morrow in it was just too much.
2033.44,2039.6, Way too much. I got the the the hint guy with all the maps. Things like a freaking like Bible.
2039.6,2044.72, But what does too much mean if people are playing like 200 hours of wow or more. Well that's true.
2044.72,2050.16, But uh and you need to put down the computer. Yeah I think I guess maybe it's kind of the
2050.16,2053.68, function of like what we do every day. Like I don't have enough time in my life to
2053.68,2056.7999999999997, devote 200 plus hours to a game at this point to get the full experience.
2057.52,2062.3999999999996, Well I have this horrible feeling that like I'm going to start playing it and possibly get into it.
2062.3999999999996,2067.04, But then I'm going to be thinking uh missing out on what's happening in wow or whatever
2067.04,2071.2799999999997, MMO I might be playing at the time. There's something about like I need to be playing that other
2071.2799999999997,2074.7999999999997, thing that everyone else is playing. Well I'm definitely going to play it. I'm going to look forward
2074.7999999999997,2078.48, to it. The big debate for me is whether I'm going to play it on my PC or on my my new like
2078.56,2085.28, widescreen HD's TV. If you want to keep your job. No actually I'd so I'm thinking it's probably
2085.28,2091.36, going to do better on Xbox 360. It's late. Right. I probably have not going to play that game just
2091.36,2098.16, because I happen to be a big fan of this move toward combining genres. So a single player
2098.16,2102.2400000000002, appear or old school RPG doesn't really do it for me. Well there are actually no one is to it.
2102.2400000000002,2107.52, Like you shoot your bow. It's like a first person shooter. Yeah nothing is exploding. You know nothing's
2108.56,2116.4, you know. I need guns and big monsters. Like that. A car or two would be nice. You're just more
2116.4,2122.08, manly than the rest. Yeah exactly. I'm happy. I'm happy with the elves and the bulls. Dad down the
2122.08,2127.92, pixie fire. Not what your problem is. Not me. You're the butch one. Yeah.
2128.96,2137.28, He's supposed to go with. I think with the comments of Chris's butchness where maybe we've hit the
2137.36,2144.7200000000003, peek. We've hit the limit for this week. I don't know if we answered your questions about
2144.7200000000003,2150.0, our game of the year or non game of the year but please feel free to hit us up on our message boards.
2151.36,2158.0800000000004, The URL being. No sorry. I'm just going to say it one up.com and then if you're going to see
2158.0800000000004,2166.7200000000003, you do that one up.com. He can make your way there. Yes. So. And we will be back sometime soon.
