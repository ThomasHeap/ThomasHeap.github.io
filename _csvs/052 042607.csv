219.68,225.12, We are dangerously close in terms of personal space here. It's a little uncomfortable in awkward. Yeah
226.96,232.32000000000002, My headset actually I can barely like reach. I'm so I have to lean forward even to like be able to sit here
232.32000000000002,236.72, Jeff already knocked over I did cook. I'm not covered by a cow carpet

242.88,244.88, You pick him up like
245.76,250.0, It was a little frightening of the way the carpet absorbed that ten ounces of coax of that

274.0,278.40000000000003, Lord of the Rings online a whole bunch of us playing it here and didn't want up in general
279.28000000000003,282.48, First PC game in a little while it's getting random one-up or stick out
282.48,287.44," Do you have extra copies of Lord of the Rings online? So that's always a good thing. Yeah, yeah, it was a place"
287.92,290.64000000000004, They always say to that voice no matter who they are or
291.28000000000003,293.28000000000003, But gender there
293.28,296.79999999999995, Also I was on Lord of the Rings online earlier today and I waited in a queue
296.88,299.52, So that's another good sign the people are actually great
301.52,304.15999999999997, I think we I mean it beats the auto assault experience
304.4,310.55999999999995," True, well, I think the only thing is like it's kind of a mixed blessing because like it's the brandy one server, right?"
311.59999999999997,315.84, It is I think that's one of the few servers. It's like really like like heavily populated
315.84,319.52," Yeah, they're actually already doing the we recommend you start on this server thing"
319.84,321.11999999999995," But again, that's a good sign"
321.28000000000003,323.92," Okay, so we'll come back to that we have that game to talk about we've got"
325.12,326.16, Halo 2
326.16,327.68, Provista
327.92,329.92, Everybody is excited about that
331.76,336.16, I don't know that's we have we have some we have some reader mail
336.8,342.48, Are we gonna do a here as of the web or was that your hero of the web that was it? How's that there you have it?
342.48,347.28000000000003," Yeah, I just got back and I'm like insanely jell eggs so I'm probably just gonna be pretty good"
347.28,353.11999999999995, Did he write this at on your vacation or I wrote that in delirium yesterday? I was telling Sean you know that feeling when like
353.2,356.0, Maybe some of kids out there don't know this feeling but when
356.64,359.84, You have a friend spend that when you're in college you have a friend spend the night your dorms
359.84,364.0, Whatever and it's like for you. I mean you're up and like you're just doing nothing you're like totally brain dead
364.15999999999997,367.52, But you're just making fun of like whatever's on TV Trinity brush
367.52,370.47999999999996," Yeah, whatever just like stopping on any random channel"
370.79999999999995,376.96," And so when I was always watching the hotel of Angela's at that time, but yeah, yeah, so that's it like so you watch that and you just like"
377.35999999999996,381.67999999999995," Look at it and you're laugh once a while. Yeah, I don't know why you haven't gone to bed yet so anyway, that's where I'm at"
383.03999999999996,384.0, Give me some TV
384.0,388.55999999999995, Very good well it it it it produced content for one up. It did
389.11999999999995,393.59999999999997, It paid off. We should talk to to be back getting your bonus for that writing assignment
396.47999999999996,397.84, That's money
397.84,400.96, What do we want to lead out? Should we just go right back in the Lord of the Rings online?
401.35999999999996,405.35999999999996," Might as well. Yeah, thanks. Oh, that's your about it big stuff convinced me"
405.35999999999996,409.35999999999996, I have a copy sitting on my desk and I want to know if there's gonna be convincing you
411.2,416.15999999999997, There might be convincing a rhyme. Come on. You can't be that hard. I only walked out of out of the second movie
418.0,420.0, Not the intended audience
421.35999999999996,423.35999999999996, I don't think not the movie license
423.35999999999996,426.88," Right, it's not the movie license based on the books but you get to play lutes"
427.67999999999995,429.03999999999996, You do get to play lutes
429.12,431.12, Sweet and clarinet
431.12,434.96000000000004, Your heel people so the word online when I came back I was surprised to see a
435.68,440.0, Big thread will big for our boards a big thread dedicated five years
441.6,443.6, By three posters
443.6,448.64000000000004," Denny no, but but a bit a bit a pretty big big sized thought red dedicated to this game and"
449.12,453.04, Usually MMO launches come and go and it's just a vacuum
453.04,458.22, So and that's this is reflective of our listeners who are our notorious
458.3,461.82000000000005," Commudence, you know, but in a good way I mean you said like I mean"
462.54,464.3, Help me guys
464.3,467.5, There they're going crazy for it. So what's the deal?
468.22,472.94000000000005," Well, it's a well, I'm not too far into who's the first one"
473.90000000000003,476.54," Far did you get well, I've got a level nine guy"
477.58000000000004,482.86, But I'm actually gonna force a cam and start somebody new but I'm so new be new be town
483.18,487.98," Yeah, same here. I'll be a little further than I mean the very early new be experiences like"
488.86,493.58000000000004, Pretty much wow like it's the same same kind of quest cycles and kind of
495.02000000000004,498.54, Accident blog a little bit negatively about about the new bezone
499.42,501.98," Even though I like the game, but my feeling was like"
502.86,508.78000000000003, The the time in which you have a dedicated new bezone that is not connected to the the actual game world
509.58000000000004,514.14, Has passed that you know I felt like wow that a really good job of
514.6999999999999,522.06, Putting the player into the world that really is there and just sort of bread crumbling you along until you got to places that were harder
522.38,528.6999999999999, Right and this sort of like artificial like play pen where only new thing out. I don't like and declare
528.6999999999999,532.6999999999999, I you're talking about kind of new bezone too because you start off in kind of an instance
532.9399999999999,536.6999999999999," Yes, where you've already like breaking out a prisoner whatever to be your correct"
536.6999999999999,538.86, You pick and that's kind of a cool that one's cool
539.34,542.62, except for I think we agreed on the wire the ring nice talking
542.62,544.62, That's total order the rings dorkism
544.78,549.66," Yeah, I'm a he's there they talk. I guess it is just straight fear into your heart"
550.0600000000001,554.7, You know I created another new character today and I went through that again and a bother me again
555.02,558.94, You don't want the black writers talking like what's put what's so scary about him?
558.94,560.3, Is there this like oh like
560.62,566.86," You know there's this stuff like I'll get you yet hopped. Yeah, you hopped and you're dog too. Yeah, it's a little like"
566.86,569.02," Oh, no, anyway besides that"
569.1,571.1, Shondos a care
571.1,573.5799999999999, I'm gonna have a contest to get rid of that copy. I got on my desk
576.06,578.86, The one thing I'm looking forward to giving it try at least is the
579.5799999999999,583.5, The ability to become one of the high level monsters like from what I understand you hit level 10
583.9,589.74," Yeah, and like you could like forsake your own dude and just go on and like take grab it be a level 50 spider or whatever and just start ganging up on"
590.14,596.14, The reason for this is there's no PVP proper because there's only good races in
596.22,603.34, Lord of the Rings online and they can't have you know men fighting Hobbits right as much fun as that would be so it's PVP
603.34,607.02, So the PVP is at when you hit level 10 you can play as a monster
607.9,611.98, Against the other in death players that game still look like a bunch of homeless people
615.34,617.34, Come on now
620.86,622.86, Don't joke
623.26,625.74, Shoked and this is the aftermath of the whiskey nerd voice
626.94,628.94, Like ready to try for every word
630.62,632.62," Swallow brilipat no, I was just like just"
633.02,637.9, To get it like back then they're close when all advanced like are they look like bumps
637.9,639.9, They didn't even afford shoes
640.3000000000001,641.82, Bigger
641.82,643.82, Hobbits don't need shoes because they have hairy feet
644.54,647.58, So if you're playing as a monster is that you know
648.3000000000001,651.1," I think you level up slightly as a monster. Yeah, much"
651.58,655.1800000000001, So it's not like the full experience like playing is a hobby
655.1800000000001,657.66," No, it's not like a character that's in the horror or anything"
657.66,661.5," Right, well, I'm just looking forward to like just screw them with all the guys that are like power levelers"
662.3000000000001,666.86," Yeah, there's some kind of advancement. There's reasons to keep playing as it I I"
667.58,670.38, I don't know talking out of my well ask in next week
670.38,674.7, I'm gonna come to check a week. We'll know more the and yeah to clarify
675.4200000000001,679.02, Sean you're right when you first create a new character the first thing that happens to you
679.1,683.8199999999999, As they put you into an instance that like starts a story right away and that is cool
684.38,690.06, I like like puts you right in you know in media ray right in the middle of a sort of epic moment
690.6999999999999,695.5, But then they stick you into a a kind of like level one through six
696.9399999999999,702.38, Dedicated like years had to learn the game thing and I think that that like takes the wind out of it sales a little bit
702.38,706.78," Right, and it's then it's right back to collecting herbs and berries humans and like Hobbits start in the new"
706.78,709.42," Yeah, the humans on top of turners are exact same area"
709.66,713.74," Someone says kill six wolves and you go kill six wolves. Yeah, I was just kind of bummed by that too"
713.9,717.8199999999999," Right, well like they could have they could have carried that instance moment out"
718.6999999999999,722.38, Further or more distinctly for each race I think
723.1,726.06," No, I gotta keep playing. I mean, it's really like"
726.86,730.3, A launch game. It's really polished and like you haven't encountered anything
730.86,735.42, No bugs on the good side. There's that it's incredibly smooth as a launch
736.38,741.5799999999999, There are a lot of players on there with an MMO needs so it's easy to group up already
741.5799999999999,750.38, I've joined fellowships. You don't come groups so everybody the so the players who are taking the game seriously say LFF in this game looking for fellowship
751.02,754.86," Yeah, I've taken for anyway just a piece of the already on day one"
755.5799999999999,761.9, Now people were I mean this game got good buzz in the weeks leading up so that helped you know the open beta went really well
762.4599999999999,764.4599999999999, So it was also a good timing for him like
765.42,770.54, Burning crusade has been out for what right months now so right little played out that there are people here
770.54,773.26, It's like all right. I'm gonna stick a while now. I'm gonna try this out
773.74,775.9799999999999, But no one in my guild while guild has
776.86,781.0999999999999, There people are trying it but no one has said I'm jumping ship through just like I'd like to play this on the side
781.5,784.86," Yeah, I think that's where it's out right now right people are just checking it out"
785.5,789.0999999999999, Seeing if it's a worthy alternative and my take is it's like the first one
790.3,794.3, This is the first one that's like made me want to play an MMO other than wow
794.38,799.42, I don't know if it's gonna replace while but like I spent my evening playing it and feeling like
800.14,801.0999999999999, You know
801.0999999999999,805.8199999999999," Okay, well that was a nice alternative to wow as opposed to play I wish I played wow instead"
806.3,809.02, Which is what it usually is for games like this true
809.42,811.42, Like can we see the first person who hits the level cap
812.14,817.42," Yeah, but it's just it's just through the entire story that yeah the stuff that's interesting to me is stuff that"
817.42,820.78, I'll have to figure out later if it's worth it but like the player combos
821.18,825.74, Or there's that color system where you can kind of lift off each other's moves like there's some
826.3,831.26, There's a system in the game for the combat or like if someone does a certain move then another person
831.98,833.8199999999999, Like there's a little color wheel that pops up
833.8199999999999,837.18," I haven't really seen it in action, so I'm just kind of talking"
837.9,843.66, Part purely theoretical but like then another player in your party can see what you did and kind of combo off of it
844.6999999999999,846.6999999999999," So, okay"
846.7800000000001,850.94, That sounds kind of interesting to me. I know like Final Fantasy 11 and stuff did that because they had that
851.5,855.9000000000001, It's called some system very similar. I think that the things to give to props for at least is that
857.0200000000001,859.0200000000001, This game's a bit around for so long
859.26,864.94," You know, it's changed it. It's very much at in years pass had the kiss of death to it sort of like"
865.6600000000001,870.0600000000001, Taint of godless not right about this damn for the last three. I was watching it going
870.62,874.3000000000001," Man, poor thing exactly. Yeah, you just sort of like wanted it to go away"
874.54,877.66," You know, so just so it's got the embarrassing everybody"
878.2199999999999,881.42," But now they really kind of got it together, you know"
881.42,885.5799999999999, Because it's part of it's just the Lord of the Rings thing. It's so like past it's prime. It's like
885.9799999999999,891.02, You know how like whatever year it was and the first movie came out McDonald's who'd want it would want the the tie-ins for
891.02,893.66, They're having meals and now it's like shaky burger shack that's got
895.02,897.18, Lord of the rest on the food chain based on the
897.42,899.42, Literally
899.42,901.42, Based on the book
901.42,905.26, I think there's still let's see how that hobbit movie can contingent to people or into this
905.8199999999999,911.3399999999999," Like no matter what I weird here it is or what yeah, I mean they the talking fans are eternal, you know"
911.3399999999999,917.26, I mean the movies you're right the movies are a bit passing out but you go on to these servers and there's some pretty hard core
917.9799999999999,919.9799999999999, Talking nerds playing
919.9799999999999,925.42, I again I know it has voice over IP and that I have to confess is probably one of the main reasons I want it play
926.62,929.66, Because I can think about the damage I could do yeah a lot of fodder there
929.98,936.14," But it's like it would be better if it were doomed because I've confessed to having read all the dude books and uh, but"
936.62,941.9, Like if I knew it's it's easy you've read all the all the dude books. It's really it's you're doing the talking
942.4599999999999,943.66, I know
943.66,945.98, But I'm ashamed I got saying that there are a do
946.54,948.54, I'm dying to play a do-nammo
949.1,954.86, It's pretty used to use nobody'll be swelling in a bit but to go in like the better arm your go it actually like
955.1800000000001,959.58, Strip the pot this like yeah like that when I was on Xbox live playing you know
959.58,963.34, Warms like a while ago and three or four weeks ago. There's a guy in our game
963.82,968.0600000000001, And we're just doing stack games with my friend Roy will make like a three a three worm game
968.46,974.0600000000001," And then we'll immediately just tag team on the other guy and talk shit to a whole time and uh, but this guy's name was doondoo"
974.62,978.38, But we had both read the book so we immediately just started talking about like
979.02,985.26," The most of skiership you'd have to have read the book, but immediately let them in on the fact that we knew what his name was and we knew like"
985.82,990.06," Like how absurd the stuff got no, I mean we're talking about like hitting him with like the"
990.7,993.98, Sexual propensity of like a 16th generation Duncan go
994.7,996.7, Like
996.7,998.7, Are you
998.7,999.66, Nontis
1000.06,1005.82," Wow, that man nothing to me. That's funny to me. Yeah, Sean left up early asleep. It was the other dune guy in the room"
1005.82,1009.98," Yeah, trust me. Wow, no, I know how to go in all skills. Let's talk about graphics cards and shit"
1013.2600000000001,1017.1, Have you read the Lord of the Rings book? Wow
1017.74,1022.7, How did you get a job here man? That should have been on like my entrance test in book two
1024.6200000000001,1026.6200000000001, When Saruman no
1027.42,1030.54," Well, you know what kind of person you're gonna get if that's your quiz neck beard"
1030.62,1042.54," You did yeah, there's a new one in that full dead"
1044.78,1046.54," Yeah, so"
1046.54,1052.54," Actually like two bucks in the soundtrack for this, too. So he's not technically dead. He went over the over the gray seas"
1053.58,1056.54, The gray havens sorry the gray seas do you're here?
1056.54,1058.54, I'm ours
1058.54,1062.86," Nothing yeah, I don't understand what you're saying. I can't even contextualize it. What possibly could you be talking about?"
1065.26,1068.62," Yeah, okay, so we'll we'll keep talking about the rings online so far"
1069.34,1071.34, So far so good. I will play it again. Yep
1071.82,1073.98, I'm looking forward to getting out of here and playing it
1074.3,1075.5, We're looking low
1075.5,1082.3799999999999," Probably not but I think it's gonna do well. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a circuit could be a good alternative like the people who are looking to get out of wow now"
1082.94,1084.94, Like now have a place to jump to
1085.1000000000001,1090.14, There's always like a certain like wave of people are just like I need something else right
1090.14,1092.14, Coming go right
1092.14,1093.3400000000001, So
1093.3400000000001,1095.3400000000001, They'll be no mass access
1096.14,1099.74," It's good stuff. I mean, it alternative a final turnative"
1100.78,1102.78, All right
1103.42,1104.78, Moving along
1104.78,1107.42, Daren do you want to discuss a haleto vista
1107.98,1109.98," Oh, a shame of the year"
1110.38,1112.38," Yeah, no"
1112.38,1118.3000000000002," First of all, first of all, I'm gonna hang my head low knowing that I have PC achievement points now and I'm there's no way I'm gonna cover it up on my own"
1118.3000000000002,1121.2600000000002, What does your first one wow just to get the first level yeah
1121.66,1124.7," Congratulations, here's the idiot badge for clearing the the tutorial"
1133.42,1135.42, Fuzzy the bear do
1136.6200000000001,1139.0200000000002, We're just gonna make noises. They're asking the pretty much okay
1139.34,1147.9," No, it's just you look at the game and you're like wow it's like it's like shellacked animatronics like characters walking me through the game"
1148.78,1150.78, It sounds like about a 78% to me
1152.06,1157.34, The beginning of that game it'd be hard to play that again like the beginning levels were so like the things you look at it now
1157.34,1159.5, And you're like wow the level design it's so
1160.1399999999999,1165.34," Two a couple years ago, and it's just like all that's been that like the texture has been optimized for vista"
1166.3,1167.34, I
1167.34,1173.26," Kind of I was just reading a bullet point, but it doesn't I mean you could put you could sharpen the the resolution on it"
1173.26,1177.6599999999999, It doesn't matter it's it's basically a bunch of I mean if you took poured concrete and rebar
1177.6599999999999,1179.74, I mean to an extent that you're like a large area
1179.74,1186.58," You know the height of like communist architecture looking inspired, you know and just start laying that goddamn concrete everywhere"
1186.58,1190.4599999999998, And sometimes you paint it green and sometimes you paint it purple. It's kind of like levittown in space
1190.46,1194.54," Just kidding, but the thing was when I I mean I'm gonna have to play it again"
1194.54,1196.7, I'm gonna have to and see how it stands up at the time
1196.7,1204.8600000000001, I just it was it was difficult because I reviewed half-life two two weeks prior to Halo two and then when you jump in you go from
1205.26,1209.66," Of course the the well-known intro to half-life two where you're like okay, there's this"
1210.22,1214.54," You know this very old-well-eaten world and whatnot you look out and you walk outside, you know the little"
1215.1,1220.3799999999999, Mean all the buildings in architecture you like this is like a plausible place like this there's a lot of yeah
1220.3799999999999,1223.74, Even though there's not even though I'm controlled and limited and where I can go
1224.46,1228.8999999999999, The placement of the environment is very convincing and that someone puts them thought into it
1228.8999999999999,1233.5," It has a history to it. It sort of tells its own history just by by the way it looks, you know sure"
1233.5,1234.86," Yeah, and"
1234.86,1237.3799999999999, And going through that experience then you start when you start off
1237.3799999999999,1241.6599999999999, Halo two of course the big things spoiler alert if you haven't if you somehow I don't play to you
1242.22,1244.22, Look to spoilers
1244.22,1247.26," It's on earth you know and you have to stuff on you're like okay, this is gonna be interesting"
1247.26,1249.1000000000001," You could always do some fascinating with this, you know"
1249.1000000000001,1252.78," It was kind of like with you know, it remember that the alien movie and there's like the alien comic"
1252.94,1255.18," Or like they took it to earth and you're like oh, it's gonna be wild"
1255.42,1260.38, But then you're like what the like earth is just like a dirty alley with like some crust
1260.38,1262.8600000000001," Yeah, like so you're going through the subways"
1262.8600000000001,1268.6200000000001," Right as like yeah, it was just like it could have been anywhere it could have just been more like it's just like Pac-Man space"
1268.62,1271.7399999999998, You know and while a game is more like those aren't not hey
1271.7399999999998,1278.3, I'm just drawing attention to it because those are not Halo's strengths and it doesn't matter because it succeeds to spite those
1278.3,1282.3, I mean it does all their things well at least on the especially on the console on the 360
1282.54,1288.26, But the way that I buy into it it does matter because like anytime someone talks automatically
1288.26,1291.26," I just don't care. I mean there's like another burn victim, you know and"
1291.6599999999999,1294.3, Like the first guy I mean to the first guy that talks to you
1294.3,1297.8999999999999," He's like cut him wax works, man. Do you come and out of the machine out not this face?"
1297.8999999999999,1302.26," No, it's pretty bad. I mean like like like it's like weird. You see like this it's just a hollow mask"
1302.26,1305.4199999999998, It's like it's like a serial killer with some kind of ass
1305.82,1311.5, He's the eyes operating like it's a pitifully underneath that level like holy crap the dude from the the the
1311.5,1315.02, The pre the skit nerdy here if the preacher comic book basically made like that
1317.58,1323.18," But yeah, it was it was pretty it's pretty rough. I think it was like, okay, so the ultimate question"
1323.18,1325.74, Can you play it with keyboard and mouse like they're talking about
1327.02,1331.48," Honestly, I tried playing it for about a level and I went I plugged in a game pad"
1331.48,1335.6000000000001, My question with really be is it with the multiplayer be as
1336.74,1342.46, Compiling as Halo 2 multiplayer on Xbox. So that's where the all that game is yeah
1342.46,1345.1000000000001," It's gonna be the multiplayer, but no one's really in multiplayer"
1345.1000000000001,1349.98," Yeah, limited number of people are actually like up online live right now, right? And yeah, so it's just kind of like"
1349.98,1350.98, It was just kind of weird
1350.98,1357.16, And stuff here. It's just kind of weird hit my guide but been seeing my lot all my live stuff like pop it up and on the Halo
1357.16,1361.6200000000001," You know, it's I definitely gonna try to I'm gonna give it try I'm gonna keep playing through it and see what happens"
1361.6200000000001,1368.34," You know if if I if my opinion changes at all, but I agree with Sean the if the strengths are gonna be in multiplayer and the maps that they get made"
1368.34,1373.6200000000001, And speaking of which I just installed the map maker earlier today and started taking trying to take around with it
1373.6200000000001,1375.6200000000001, It's a lot more complex than I was hoping it would be
1375.9799999999998,1383.54, It's like in far cry they make it that thing really easy because like it's alter the world and like in the map and just drop right into the world and here
1383.54,1384.8999999999999, It's just like
1384.8999999999999,1391.34," It's basically if you've made maps before and Halo 1 you'll be okay, but so is this not yet the reason to install Mister Darren?"
1391.34,1393.9399999999998, I know I would not say this is the killer reason
1394.9399999999998,1399.3799999999999, Maybe shadow run we'll see if you get a stable version of that but
1400.3400000000001,1406.3200000000002, I don't know it's how many people here at official games for windows magazine are running faster yet
1407.9,1410.66, And in this room we got one we got one
1410.66,1416.66," I get to take that computer home. Yeah, okay actually the yeah the count's gonna go up to two soon. I'm giving sure"
1416.66,1418.66, I have an extra piece of Sean's gonna strike it around
1419.42,1426.3400000000001," But yeah, I mean to be honest with you like I have one machine that runs Vista, but I also have a dual boot and for XP because I want it to be stable"
1430.0200000000002,1432.0200000000002, Oh
1433.6200000000001,1435.6200000000001," Yeah, okay"
1435.6200000000001,1438.9, But we need to make a different licensing deal with Apple
1440.42,1445.3000000000002," Come on, but piece of gaming is researching I hear oh yeah nice segue Darren"
1446.18,1451.74," Yeah, so nice to did anybody actually bring the numbers anybody was anybody smart enough for not of course"
1451.74,1454.72, We are so unorganized with this podcast EGM what I had it in here
1455.18,1457.7, Retro nuts what I had it in here you're all five. I suck
1458.3400000000001,1460.66," Yeah, so that was some kind of news story about"
1461.9,1465.46, PC gaming numbers it was in the news it was in six
1466.18,1470.66," 2006 yeah, yeah, it was it was from the New York Times article the post it on Monday or Tuesday"
1470.66,1475.1000000000001, I think and the evidence that it's up some dude walking into EB
1475.7,1481.3, Or best buyer whatever like running straight to the biocopious sim for well that was that was the little anecdotal
1481.3,1486.94, I know thing to go with the actual sales numbers which showed a positive increase in PC gaming
1486.94,1487.98, Yeah numbers
1487.98,1493.6200000000001, Growth market right so you could probably go to some reputable game side where podcast and get the actual information
1494.22,1495.22, Not here
1495.22,1499.42, How much is that that is like because it was the down cycle of the council
1499.42,1501.9, You're like as the tail end of the Xbox and see you know
1501.9,1507.5800000000002, I just want I just wish one day that and the NPD actually accurately tracked numbers for online sales and digital distribution rise
1507.74,1510.7, Because really like retail is just gonna like I mean at some point
1510.7,1515.8200000000002, I think retail is just gonna dry up for PC gaming and it's you're gonna see people just getting downloading all their stuff
1516.78,1518.78, Steam is a prime example
1519.5,1521.82," Yeah, but what about all those great games for windows?"
1521.82,1526.22," Um, Kiosks at the store where you can oh right by the game for windows games and"
1527.34,1531.5, And your magazine you can buy that there too. You got such bad at you today
1534.22,1540.28," Podcasts and I'm in my bum and yeah, if my bad attitude you just have a good attitude because you went on vacation"
1540.28,1542.28, So fuck you
1542.28,1545.0, You were not vacationing you had to be here at work every year
1545.0,1548.6, It's been a fun too. I was part of this was not the beginning of
1549.24,1551.24, The level design for a minute
1553.28,1558.52," I'm mainly in hey I'm in the halo mainly for the fiction though this random fiction. Yeah, so you've read all the news"
1561.52,1566.36, Like I knew like I was one of the few who like appreciate like what it meant when feet me see more came out
1566.36,1568.36, Okay
1568.84,1570.84, What was the line oh
1570.84,1572.84, See you next time see more
1573.76,1575.76," Sorry, that is a"
1578.0,1584.9199999999998, Great villain the high-end Ray mind is is basically just a giant two carnivorous plant that
1585.4799999999998,1587.4799999999998, See me like she pops up at it nowhere and
1587.84,1590.36, Hat has a few words to say and then let's
1590.6799999999998,1593.84," Credit because he's see more no, I mean that's you know the whole deal"
1593.84,1598.08," More little shop-hars fun. Yeah, there's some more but no"
1600.1999999999998,1602.1999999999998," No, no"
1603.1999999999998,1608.56, So like see more but this little shop of course I got volume is one who seven
1613.56,1615.56, I don't
1617.56,1621.8, I was like I'll come in and I'll read that thing. See aren't you glad you were now?
1622.32,1626.68," Now there's no turning back it's like I went on yeah, how many of the novels of your it?"
1627.2,1628.2, The halo one
1628.2,1634.44, They just one of them just came in today. They keep showing them we get every book series here pretty interested to find out like because there's like
1634.44,1636.1599999999999," You know, I played multiplayer and there's a red"
1636.48,1639.1599999999999, Spartan armor and a blue Spartan armor
1639.1599999999999,1643.9199999999998," I'm yeah, I want to find out about like how they chose to designate those with various colors. That's right red versus blue"
1643.9199999999998,1648.44, I'm kind of curious about how that works. So the extended fictional answer that question. I don't want to be a little like you know
1648.44,1650.44, Sort of righteous about these kind of things
1651.1200000000001,1654.9, But I'm thinking if you haven't yet read like Hucco Berry Finn or
1657.2,1663.42," Oh, you're gonna get all fucking more in peace or or it'll be more recent slide or else five cuz Kervana get to stay"
1663.5,1666.04, They'll be fucking wasting your time reading halo now
1667.4,1669.4, Other reading to do first
1669.4,1674.1200000000001, There's a required list when you get past that list then you can see your ass down and there's some gaming novels
1674.12,1678.8799999999999, I can't talk cuz I said I read do and I know like it a lot of people are horrified
1678.8799999999999,1681.6399999999999," They're like oh god Frank Herbert so much better than the halo novels, but"
1681.6399999999999,1686.84, We get it's still it's still a lot of reading and that's about as bad as I've I'm that's about my most
1686.84,1688.84, Washa like reading a day
1688.84,1694.36, I got worse than that. Do you watch your worst set was your most embarrassing fanfic book?

1824.14,1830.14, What are those I've always wondered what those books are like I mean this totally wasn't just a traditional GFW radio
1830.14,1834.88," That this was not our plan to talk about the mobilizations of games, but this we found a red topic just by bullshitting"
1835.6200000000001,1840.74, What what's on the pages of these things like I just imagined the reason I so dismiss it was I I think halo novel
1840.74,1846.96, Mike okay page 43 master chief empty's a submachine gun into grunt five and six reloads
1847.74,1851.42, Submachine gun in a grunt eight nine a locus appears or whatever
1851.42,1853.46, You know what I call the insect
1853.46,1860.34," No, not done page 87 master chief jumps master chief lands master chief throws a flat plasma grenade"
1860.78,1863.38, Shoots and master chief reloads and court punishes
1863.38,1867.8," Matthew chief dies because it has one continue left. I'm sorry, but the work of things are a lot deeper than that"
1867.8,1873.76," You know, yeah, maybe because work has to deeper game than hail chief green. It's basically your the master of the nargoal planes"
1878.0,1880.44, Any number of your Lord of the Rings rip off
1880.44,1883.52," Yeah, it's just got right it's high fantasy"
1883.52,1889.28, The spirit of the world of warcraft universe we encourage you to insert your own name with a protagonist
1889.28,1890.28, With a peer
1890.28,1893.6, And the following text yeah now it's not like a right your own story
1893.6,1895.6, Sort of how about I choose your own adventure
1895.6,1902.36," All right, it's not you know it's actually like you know there is a whole huge backstory in this game and that's what these books are the books tell the backstory"
1902.36,1905.48, Of the game like you get some in a quest text
1905.48,1909.8, But then it's like go to the novel for the real so you mean it's not like a literal like depiction of the game
1909.8,1911.9199999999998, There's not no no this 100 pages of
1916.9199999999998,1921.1999999999998, More does so it's not a thousand pages of you fighting like
1921.2,1926.0800000000002," Nixie right now this is like 10,000 years before wild start of so serious"
1927.0800000000002,1929.0800000000002, We're taking you seriously no
1931.0800000000002,1934.68, That's a good good writers doing these things. It was just kind of like well
1935.2,1937.2," Yeah, I mean you know relative"
1937.6000000000001,1940.3600000000001, It's Philip Roth isn't doing it in the in his off-hours
1941.72,1949.6000000000001," These are good as like an R.A. cell guitar, which is you know exactly the night elves and the warcraft novels when they're you know in town buy and something"
1950.24,1956.9399999999998," They have problems with the random hoard people wrote in the hand and no, this doesn't like wow gameplay in novelization"
1956.9399999999998,1961.08," It's not like shouting for options, it's Sean with the straight face"
1962.8799999999999,1965.6799999999998, Sean just said they're about as good as the
1966.8799999999999,1968.8799999999999, Books the I think the goose bumps books
1973.08,1978.52," Yeah, that's a different author dude. It's our all-stein at R.A. Salvador. Sorry loser"
1979.6799999999998,1983.3999999999999," He did the dragon lands novels. Thank you very much. Yeah, we all knew that"
1984.9599999999998,1987.8799999999999, What's the difference between I read all I mean I've been reading this well
1987.8799999999999,1991.9599999999998, It's a lot of my reading existence. So it's just kind of a natural continuation
1992.6799999999998,1995.6999999999998, It's a bad way. I think the only these bumps has got larger print
1999.3999999999999,2002.1599999999999, Actually I tried reading I tried reading one of these books. It was the
2002.7199999999998,2006.4399999999998, I hate to say this the perfect dark one because Greg Rucker was writing it
2006.96,2010.3600000000001, So I just know from this from his graphic novel in the world. So
2014.3600000000001,2017.0, I think I be guys going to room and admit to the shady
2017.72,2019.72, They've ever read this closet
2019.72,2022.72, It's half this job if we wouldn't you know
2023.6000000000001,2026.8, Could we I mean and plus these bus can be free everyday
2027.92,2030.04, You read all those the glowsy doon books
2030.56,2035.02, It's like like one hair removed from what we're talking about here in some cases. It's probably worse
2035.02,2038.3799999999999, I tell you there's though there's a line in the third or fourth-thune book
2038.3799999999999,2040.58, We're he talks about someone having an adult beast
2040.58,2044.86," Well, right which has become one of my many names for my characters in the end"
2045.1399999999999,2047.5, You know what's dried up around here at the war hammer
2047.9,2050.7, We started getting we were getting like new warm hammer books every day
2051.7,2055.14," It really I was always swear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's rare"

2070.36,2077.12," Collected them all and after I read them of course and yeah, I put them all in a big box to send to my friend Rory"
2077.12,2083.8199999999997, He did some illustrations for us back when and we didn't have the freelance budget to pay him so I said I don't know
2083.8199999999997,2085.98, You up dude. I got you up

2116.7400000000002,2121.1800000000003, Down to like the local game shop where they got like a commercial on TV
2121.1800000000003,2126.5800000000004," You know, they spaced up all their money to say that they had a TV commercial right? It's like anime manga"
2127.3,2130.3, Comics teams manga
2130.3,2132.3, Man yeah
2132.3,2135.46," Anyway, so he goes down there and he takes the bus cold ass"

2160.6000000000004,2162.6000000000004, That one didn't look so good
2162.6000000000004,2166.7400000000002, And then so he basically this is the moral this fucking rad stories
2166.94,2170.1400000000003, He had to take that full box and get back on the bus
2170.14,2174.42, Right home the box of that shit. I would have just left them on the sidewalk
2176.54,2179.3399999999997, So that's how we paid him for the work he did for our magazine

2214.3799999999997,2218.7799999999997, That's even better. I was funny because I wondered what happened in those books not that I was looking to read them
2218.7799999999997,2221.7799999999997, You said to get rid of them. It was like dad saying to clean your room

2227.02,2229.02, I found a way to use my talent

2273.46,2278.62, That doesn't do has it right strategy that doesn't count right any novels. I was
2278.62,2286.14," Heavily into dragon lantern high school. See, that's where the stems from okay? Well, that's that that's on the acceptable side of"
2286.38,2288.74," All right, just cuz you're our Ryan's feelings"
2288.74,2290.9, He told me to was for

2301.2599999999998,2303.2599999999998, Shut up
2303.26,2308.48," I can't make fun of my room to see now is been quiet again, so talk about me"
2308.48,2315.6200000000003, What you get now it's on you why are they better than than scavence later because they're based off a real campaign in D and D is played by Gary guy gicks
2318.94,2321.7000000000003," They're in tells the truth. That's right, right? Yeah"
2323.1800000000003,2327.0200000000004, They're in you clearly read them too. I read I voted these players. I read each novel
2327.0200000000004,2329.6200000000003, I wanted to make sure I made saving through his as he's chapter point
2329.62,2334.38, No back when I was a high school back when I was like way into the Indian stuff like I used to think those were like
2335.22,2341.1, Awesome the dragon novels have a good reputation even as books when you go back in the end
2341.1,2342.8599999999997, When look at him now though it's like
2344.98,2346.58, He too I
2346.58,2351.7, Know I shouldn't have to say even as books as I for books. They're considered good as books
2352.9,2357.24, As opposed to whatever we're gonna hear about this on their message for is that's for sure
2357.24,2359.7999999999997," Yeah, the dragon lands army is is coming after us"
2361.0,2363.4799999999996, He's gonna come here joining costume
2363.4799999999996,2367.3999999999996, They're gonna join better is when they come in. They're so earnest about like convincing
2367.3999999999996,2371.3999999999996, They think they're gonna convince you otherwise like I did that hero the web couple weeks ago then the Rudo one
2371.7999999999997,2373.7999999999997, Did you see that and I look at a message boards?
2374.52,2377.4799999999996, There's some dude on there trying to do everywhere you were talking about
2377.4799999999996,2380.04," Yeah, he was all mad because I spoiled something"
2380.04,2382.04, I might say
2382.04,2386.96, Like the goddamn nutritional information off like a back of it like nila wafer or something
2386.96,2390.36, Then he ended up spoiling the goddamn show for him
2392.16,2396.7599999999998, Just laughing I did say anything because I could really like L.O.L. doesn't cut it like I was like
2397.48,2399.96, Tensley laughing at him on my end of the computer
2401.16,2404.04," Yeah, I wasn't though I'm stay your friend"

2664.68,2669.72, So if there's ever a game that you're gonna want to take extensive notes on I always did a thing that whenever I was P

2672.8399999999997,2674.8399999999997, Whenever I won't guys whenever I would write

2758.84,2760.1200000000003, No one really ever says that
2760.1200000000003,2762.76, You call sellers like to them in jobs for the NES
2762.76,2764.76, Come on
2768.76,2770.76," Okay, so"
2773.8,2775.8, You're listening to legendary threat
2780.6800000000003,2782.6800000000003, And we're back
2782.6800000000003,2786.84," So in our little downtown that we started yeah, I'm running amongst ourselves about E3"
2787.2400000000002,2793.1600000000003, Cuz the show of shows is coming up once again and a in a kind of different and neutered form this year
2794.1200000000003,2797.56, Last year was announced that the show was actually dead
2799.0,2805.96, Due to a number of big publishers kind of realizing it maybe it's time has passed as a show and that was causing too much money
2805.96,2807.32, And it wasn't worth it
2807.32,2809.8, But over the past year there's there's been a
2810.44,2815.88, Kind of a attempted verification of the show and now there is sort of any three sort of
2816.84,2821.96, Though if you talk to different game companies and ask them what exactly is going on with the E3?
2821.96,2824.76, They all won by one say I don't know. I thought you knew
2825.2400000000002,2827.2400000000002, So everybody's still kind of like scrambling
2827.88,2830.92," In terms of exactly how the show's gonna go down, but there is one"
2831.56,2834.52, Happening July I think 11th 11th 11th and
2835.32,2837.32, We will be there covering it
2838.36,2840.36, But
2840.36,2844.84, We wanted to use this opportunity to discuss in some detail
2844.84,2848.2000000000003," Yes, sir the entire notion of E3 critics awards"
2848.76,2851.2400000000002," The E3 critics. Oh, yes, that that"
2851.56,2853.56, Austin that
2853.56,2859.8," Is anybody in the room other than me and E3 critic? No, just you see mom's special former judge former judge right"
2859.8,2865.1600000000003," Actually, I think you had to give it up to me didn't you because I think it was like one person per staff"
2865.1600000000003,2872.2000000000003," Yeah, and for like a year I had boycotted out of principle and then I came back and you know why I came back"
2872.68,2873.96, Why did you come back?
2873.96,2875.96, Thanks for asking
2876.7599999999998,2882.04, I came back because I realized it was the only way to get access to certain games at the show
2882.8399999999997,2887.3999999999996, And as EIC of a magazine I thought it was important for me to see these games
2887.72,2890.4399999999996, But being EIC of a magazine was not good enough
2891.72,2893.72, I needed to be a game critic
2894.12,2900.6," In other words, have it you know running a magazine wasn't enough for the game company as a consider it a worthy"
2901.56,2908.8399999999997, Where the qualification it was whether or not I had the ability to give their game in a ward or not right deemed whether I could see the game or not
2909.4,2910.68, So
2910.68,2920.36, Was interesting this year is that the show is not really the E3 that we knew it that it was this is not 500 companies in a gigantic convention center
2921.0,2923.0, This is
2923.0,2927.08, 30 something companies spread out over a whole bunch of different hotels in Los Angeles
2927.24,2929.24, It's really a much much much smaller
2930.2,2939.24, Affent and yet the E3 game critics are still apparently in operation as we got as you should know as you're you're still one of them
2939.8799999999997,2944.52, As I am still one of them I do know I got the we're back in operation
2945.56,2948.3599999999997, And we're gonna start and we're gonna do these awards again this year
2948.6,2953.4799999999996, But because of the fact that the venues is so much smaller and not every company is gonna be there
2953.4799999999996,2958.7599999999998, They're now gonna consider the the gamers days that the companies throw
2959.3199999999997,2962.4399999999996, Do we need to we explain what those are just really quick?
2962.4399999999996,2967.7999999999997, Just like just lying shows basically right right so a company like Ubisoft or whoever's Sony
2967.7999999999997,2972.4399999999996, Sega they are now having days in in the next month or so
2973.0,2977.3999999999996, Where they're inviting the press from all over the country or all over the world to come and see their showcase
2977.56,2983.3199999999997, They're lineup. This is an alternative to E3 that that these companies started doing and they've done it for years
2983.32,2988.6000000000004, I'm trying to try to the end of E3 they've done it is and there've been several in the in the in this year even you know
2988.6000000000004,2991.7200000000003, Right midway had one in the writing of the year in Las Vegas for example
2993.0,2995.56," But anyway, yeah, they're they're basically just press parties"
2995.56,3003.48, So the companies able to to to show the press what it's you know what product it plans to release so they set up booths where we can check out the games
3003.48,3008.1200000000003, They show they have giant screens where they show trailers of games that don't have gameplay yet
3008.1200000000003,3010.1200000000003, It's centered center and
3010.44,3014.52, The game critics have said that we're gonna be including those gamers days as
3016.68,3019.12, Events where we can consider things for awards
3019.24,3021.5, So it'll be really cool going to these lion shows annoying
3021.5,3026.12, There's a curtain where the game where the game critics can get go behind the curtain and play the game as well
3026.12,3027.12, The rest of the
3027.12,3030.62, The guys in in the in steerage get to watch your video screen exactly
3030.62,3035.4," He different from me three. It's not even that. I mean, I think the issue of you may be kind of in more in your face"
3035.4,3039.66," Maybe we take different issue with it, but in many cases to my knowledge"
3040.14,3043.8199999999997, Games that were considered for for e3 critics awards. We're not necessarily playable
3044.3799999999997,3049.3799999999997, And that was one of our problems and I was one of your problems before is that right just the whole nature of for one
3049.3799999999997,3054.6," Well, they kept my words for for unfinished product in many cases on playable on you know"
3054.6,3056.6, Unplayable product and then in increasingly
3057.7799999999997,3063.64, Product that didn't reflect the content that was going to be that was going to be made available to consumer
3063.64,3065.64," Yeah, with launch so for example"
3066.52,3071.7999999999997, Like if you look at the fizz town demo for half life too that they had never appeared in that form
3073.48,3078.0," In the actual game, you know with the whole segment where you know the AI was drawing oozing"
3078.0,3080.64, Oz as it would you know peak throwing a little
3081.04,3086.48," Camer through the window to look where you're at and then breaking down the door to get to you and stuff. Yeah, and now if you had said"
3087.12,3091.3599999999997," We're gonna give in a word to this, you know and increasingly I mean like that was I mean"
3091.3599999999997,3095.06, That was a classic case of smoke and mirrors you put together something that was
3095.58,3096.58, designed to
3096.58,3103.7599999999998," To generate hype and it worked really well and just five we saw the final games great, but in the whole thing is just giving awards to"
3104.66,3105.86, these
3105.86,3110.52, You know our souls the commercials and and and and they're just I mean
3110.52,3114.18," There's just so many things involved that you just like well, what's the point?"
3114.18,3118.46, It's not a contest I mean people always get to come and win e3 it became it's like
3118.46,3121.8," Yeah, you know, it's about getting another bad idea"
3121.8,3124.98, I would I would wager not wager I would contend that
3124.98,3132.04, Part of the downfall of e3 was this very thing I think that what started happening was company started caring more about that
3132.04,3138.78, Then they did about actually like making and finishing their games right so they started devoting more resources to making these
3138.78,3143.42, Frick and e3 demos which was taking away from the development time of the real game
3143.58,3147.9, This is where a lot of the money that they're talking about losing it e3 was going to yeah
3147.9,3150.78, And I've checked it to it even further because from a consumer's viewpoint
3150.98,3156.88, It was very clear why this was happening it was it was a it was a mutual back scratching scenario where for
3157.62,3163.58, Websites and magazine such as ourselves having your logo and your URL or whatever appear within a word
3163.58,3169.3, Icon on the on the retail product was just another way or an advertisement. It was just another way to increase visibility of your own brand
3169.3,3174.38," Yeah, on the other end of things they could then turn and use your awards as a marketing tool now"
3174.6600000000003,3178.54, If you're an average consumer enthusiast kind that doesn't listen to this you know
3178.54,3183.26, GFW rating doesn't you know go on the web for information to read the magazine and you go to the store
3183.26,3186.86, And all you see are these boxes with all these little golden silver things and you're like oh
3186.86,3190.46, This is great this thing one a bunch of an awards you're used to seeing that they like oh
3190.94,3195.1, Like yes this one like six Academy Awards and a couple nominations and whatever the case
3195.1,3198.62, You're I don't mean to say that person is an imbicill or anything
3198.62,3203.06, But they're probably just saying okay an award's got to count for something right otherwise it wouldn't be a word
3203.38,3208.42, And in this case the counter for absolutely nothing and in many cases you will see you'll still see till today
3208.74,3211.7799999999997, Games that come out where they critics might not necessarily have anything
3212.18,3215.86, Especially chair will say or quoteable to say about them. So those won't appear on the box
3216.5,3221.58, Neither will there are view scores but instead you'll see one and sometimes two and three year old e3 awards
3222.18,3225.58, Listed on the box of games that are coming out this year and again
3226.2999999999997,3231.98, What services is that doing anyone that something some someone that looked at a a preview that might not have had
3233.14,3237.62, That of a section of the game that might not even be in the game that I'm buying now or might it just been a movie
3237.62,3240.9, Some guy watched the movie and got all excited and that's even because he was like
3241.14,3245.74, One of the proud few who got to look at that movie before when the rest of the world right and so
3245.74,3248.7799999999997, So all the years ago he he blew his load on it and then yeah
3248.7799999999997,3254.7799999999997, You're looking at it. It's just part of the reason he blew his load on it and frankly is because he had this early
3255.06,3258.34, Exclusive access right he was also excited to be there right
3258.34,3263.38, So it's basically it's assigning or basically even without a number it's assigning a review score to a game
3263.38,3264.9, It's a preview build or something
3264.9,3269.1800000000003," Or there's a perception of doing that exactly yeah, that's exactly what it is"
3269.1800000000003,3273.7000000000003, I mean like they see gold medal and they don't ask where that gold medals from the general right and then
3273.7000000000003,3276.82, You know to get to your earlier point about it being playable or not
3276.82,3281.26, That was always a sticking point with these awards and it was something that was debated a lot
3281.78,3286.54, Amongst judges themselves as it became an issue over the first few years of the awards
3286.9,3292.74, But it was an endless can of worms with no real answer because the definition of what was playable
3293.2599999999998,3296.7, Was it actually played yourself or was it was it?
3296.7,3303.62, It's playing it and then if you played yourself was this something that was actually in the game or had they Jerry rig this thing
3303.62,3310.18," Right, you know had they just made something playable quote unquote just for these judges to do that was never gonna actually be in the game"
3310.18,3312.46, I mean it really the questions are endless
3312.46,3318.42, It's just amounts to the fireworks show and you throw a bunch of pretty colors up near and whoever the kind of guests like whatever got the most ooze
3318.42,3322.1, Nause and say but and the reason question of all's who gets a shit
3322.1,3328.2200000000003, And you know why should these things be competing and now and then bringing it full circle the point that we're bringing this up for is that
3328.7,3336.66, That there's like such a desperation there to continue this tradition yeah of mutual backscratching it just seems even more like
3337.62,3343.7, Just to baldly absurd that you're taking it and saying it's now this decentralized saying we're okay
3343.7,3345.7," Well, what you saw a couple months ago at"
3346.1,3348.1, You know Sony's
3348.1,3354.42, Place that counts in this to yeah what you're gonna see another month from now is gonna count to so basically just you know
3354.42,3358.58, Whatever whatever kind of press junk gets happened. It's like it's not like Ryan said
3358.58,3362.14, It's just the same thing it's it's it ultimately amounts of the same thing as E3
3362.14,3364.14, It's just it's just decentralized physically
3364.5,3370.1, But for some reason it just I don't know it's just me it makes it seem even more absurd and it shows like how
3370.5,3372.7799999999997, I mean there's just such it no it feels it feels
3372.7799999999997,3374.74, I mean I'm a expert to keep this right
3374.74,3378.3399999999997, Great and it's weird for me as somebody like in the group like part of me
3378.3399999999997,3383.3399999999997," You know, definitely wants to like bite the hand that feeds like I did a couple years ago and quit and"
3383.54,3387.3799999999997, Complain about it publicly like on this podcast because part of me feels like it's bullshit
3387.3799999999997,3389.98, But on the other hand like I want to see the games too
3390.3799999999997,3393.02, your sort of like you know
3393.98,3396.74, You know a prisoner of the thing if you want to see the games
3397.38,3399.38, You know I mean
3399.38,3405.86," Yeah, well, yeah, yeah even spreading them around like because all these pre-three events that you're allowed to vote on are all over the place like what"
3406.82,3411.7, Judge is gonna be at all of these to like right everything that's it. I get any three at least you could say well
3411.7,3413.7, You had access to everything
3413.7,3419.94, Like who who's gonna be going to LA and then New York and then you know Paris if someone's got some Paris and there's even more
3419.94,3423.06, Where they have the of course when they have these events. I mean there
3423.06,3427.1," I mean not suggesting anything is super improper, but they're catered"
3427.1,3430.5," You know, there's entertainment there, you know, there will be"
3431.14,3437.2200000000003," Like in the case of Yays last event literal dog and pony show for the the same's pets, you know outside"
3437.2200000000003,3439.2200000000003, They've got
3439.2200000000003,3441.2200000000003," Well, maybe not ponies that dog show"
3441.54,3445.06, But so I mean there's all these other things and again these are not I mean
3445.06,3452.22," That's not an environment that you want any sort of valid critique to a current. Yeah, I mean just look flat out"
3452.22,3457.1, You don't you don't want but of course most of the audience doesn't know that this is why we stopped doing reviews
3457.38,3462.5, That were where we were required to do them at the game company. You know we did one or two of those
3462.74,3464.2599999999998, You know
3464.2599999999998,3469.86, And it we you know it was ill advised that we did and we're not doing it anymore because
3470.26,3476.7400000000002, Because it's a it's an artificial environment. It's not the environment that someone who pays for the game is gonna get and for accountability
3476.7400000000002,3481.3, It's not that I honestly I don't think anyone goes and says hey that was a good ice cream sandwich
3481.3,3484.7400000000002, And that I'd never seen a dog do it back flip while catching a frisbee
3485.06,3487.86, This has got to be one of the best games of three
3488.1,3492.1800000000003, But because that situation is there it doesn't look proper
3492.1800000000003,3495.6600000000003, It's unseemly so with your audience is aware of those conditions
3495.8199999999997,3498.94, It's very easy for them to say well hey what about those?
3499.2599999999998,3503.54, Even if you know for a fact I mean there's just really no objective way of saying it you're like yeah
3503.54,3507.42, Was there a nice cream sandwich and watching the dog back flip catch the frisbee but
3508.7,3512.58," That's not why I thought I thought this game was actually super cool, you know"
3512.94,3515.7, And it's just just why they have to play
3515.7,3517.7, But if we as as you know
3517.7,3520.02, Lay people ourselves looking at another industry
3520.02,3525.14," We're hearing a journalist do that we might have a similar form of skepticism. Yeah, you totally know"
3525.66,3527.66," You know I go yeah, huh?"
3527.66,3528.66, Very hard
3528.66,3534.7," No, they took that dude to like an all-you-can-eat buffet that not only had like pot roast and stuff"
3534.7,3538.3799999999997, But they had Chinese food they had like a sushi bar all-you-can-eat
3538.3799999999997,3543.54, You know they could make your own tacos and nachos and then he writes ten pages about how good right?
3543.54,3549.42, And they said that do they're over and over and over and over again like they said them through there like five ten
3549.42,3551.42, 15 20 times
3551.42,3553.42, And they have a preview
3553.42,3555.42, He's right
3555.42,3557.42, The line about 20 times
3557.42,3558.42, And like
3558.42,3559.42, Here we go
3559.42,3561.42, Groundhogs they hit the fucking buffet line
3563.42,3565.42, What am I gonna try differently to this time?
3565.42,3569.42, So you'll put the sushi in the roast and then of course the other
3571.42,3573.42, And the other thing they came up about
3573.42,3575.42, We're making tacos
3575.42,3577.42, We're not gonna move anyone is right now
3580.42,3582.42, To crunch rapture looper
3583.42,3588.92," Okay, so we're gonna take a couple read a questions we gonna do that Brian Ryan Scott"
3589.42,3592.42, We got a question. We got a stuff calling them reader questions
3593.42,3594.42, What are we looking for?
3594.42,3599.26, Reading the podcast they're listening. Okay listen our questions mr. editors stickler
3599.42,3607.58," Yeah, I'm freaking a word Nazi. Yeah, all right. We have a couple of good questions this week the first one is from hurtful mad max"
3607.58,3613.74," Yeah, he asks have you ever played through a game that really caught your attention you love it"
3613.74,3618.06, Yet many years later when you play that same game for an astrologic or cinema reasons
3618.06,3623.5, You realize that it wasn't as awesome as you thought it was I'm not talking perly about graphics please share your thoughts
3624.22,3628.38, So does anybody have a game like that that goes for just about every game you played as a kid
3628.94,3635.8199999999997, And I've said this for but it's like the world's another place when you're 10 and and and all you get all mom can afford is like
3635.98,3639.5800000000004, Maybe one game every like five or six months damn well better like that
3640.6200000000003,3643.98, Play it over over again leave it on all night leave it to Ted no one all night all night
3644.46,3646.46, Because they're the save option
3646.86,3651.7200000000003," Right down that password, but you come I mean, but it doesn't make it does I think age makes it very significant"
3651.7200000000003,3654.02, Access to different different because when you have
3654.86,3660.9, The ability to basically pick and choose to play whatever you want and if you get one that sucks you like it
3660.9,3664.42, Whatever I picked bad one just turn put it away traded in go play something else
3664.42,3667.46, You know as opposed to when I mean it's kids now
3667.46,3670.62, I mean even then you know you trade games and stuff and rentals available
3670.62,3673.98, But it does make a difference and so I think there are a lot of people that are in
3674.9,3679.3," Lucely our age bracket. I know there's a difference between like what 25 and up here, but"
3680.34,3684.88, Like we've all got that and I think that's like part of the whole danger of like you know like the
3685.6800000000003,3689.44," With with I don't not returnaughts, but I mean when you look at it"
3689.44,3694.6800000000003," It is it well, it's one of the interesting things I'll turn around to some positive about I mean if you go back and play and like if you do go back and play"
3694.6800000000003,3698.08, You can't gauge that experience and once in a while legitimately
3698.08,3703.0," You will find the gem and you're like okay, this is definitely timeless like this game did something even though"
3703.0,3707.04," It wasn't made to be timeless. It was made to make money in a very specific, you know moment time"
3707.04,3711.7400000000002," It ended up working that way and those are great, but I think when you do go back"
3712.2599999999998,3716.8599999999997, The majority of those games are not timeless at all and they are completely unplayable and they suck and you know
3716.8599999999997,3721.64, They start more and more you're seeing that now with we just got the virtual console out and start buying all these games
3721.7999999999997,3723.7999999999997, You're just gonna realize
3723.7999999999997,3725.7999999999997," Games, that's so good, you know"
3726.52,3729.9799999999996, Even like you know her socks buy that was like so much fun
3730.22,3732.74, It was like when I favorite games every the time you look at it now
3732.74,3737.14, I'm afraid to play that's a game actually will not play again because I know it's just gonna make me say
3738.06,3740.06, Wasn't all that
3740.06,3742.06, I can hear you say something Sean
3742.06,3743.06, Hi can you hear me?
3743.06,3748.62," Yeah, sorry didn't mean I thought we had to take like a different call these so I mean that's one case"
3748.62,3754.5, I mean some some hold up super Metroid. I mean I have played that sense definitely still as good as it was
3754.5,3756.5, I guess I just don't go Metroid one again
3756.94,3762.46," Why has I think those are the fact that the map was gone was really bugging yeah, it is not a world god"
3762.46,3767.02, I still love that game. I can't think of many things. I played a doom again recently
3767.02,3770.2200000000003, And I loved it all over again the same thing for marathon
3770.5,3773.58," Loved it all over again, all right. You know, there actually know what I was playing doom again"
3773.58,3776.98, I was like there was one thing where I figured there was a jumping or some basic thing that
3777.2200000000003,3781.26, A basic convention that's been added since that I was like I really need this to play
3781.26,3785.9," I think I might have been jumping something like that. Yeah, you don't jump and doom"
3786.06,3790.86," Right, so I'm ever going back and play that going I'll allow we sit the jump key and doom and it never works ever"
3791.82,3794.54, Even a hundred times later. It's still doesn't work for some weird
3795.54,3797.54, Jump damn it
3798.1800000000003,3800.1800000000003, How about you Ryan
3801.3,3806.2200000000003," Lots of old Nintendo games that's suck now. Do you yeah, yeah"
3809.34,3811.1800000000003, Can't really think of anything particular
3812.02,3816.5, Even recently I mean because I had started playing Battlefield 1942 again and
3816.5,3822.62, And while the air combat stuff was great. I was just I couldn't believe I mean part of it's because of the
3822.62,3827.1, What success of iterations did to stream line the game and it's like almost unplayable now
3827.1,3831.82, Without once you become accustomed to those it's so hard to go back. You're like right I can't join the squad
3831.82,3833.18, I can't you know tell where
3833.34,3837.7, These guys are at I can't revive dead allies and all these things that you're like there're no big deal
3837.7,3841.26, You just kind of think they've been there all along you go back. You didn't admit so at the time though
3841.26,3844.66," Right of course you didn't but no, but the question is about going back and replaying them"
3844.66,3846.66," So yeah, I mean and that's the case not of"
3847.06,3852.02, That's the case of the game aging and causing itself to age with by correcting itself with you know
3852.3399999999997,3858.22, Doing it and of course there's a game set never will ever age like Tetris right something
3858.66,3860.98, Star control time most forever right
3861.3799999999997,3867.54, But any random thing like if you take any random thing you're like like but by you Billy or Kate make you or whatever
3867.54,3873.2999999999997, You just name something splatter house like you get splatter house on bird. I mean God play that and try to tell me that's fun
3873.94,3875.94, And you made us in some cool back with
3877.6200000000003,3879.6200000000003, My goodness game
3882.26,3888.02," Yeah, I'll be east. I mean not anything night trapping hold up today. Well, that didn't hold up"
3889.94,3894.94, Hold up when not enough Dana play. You did do that bought that game to like beat off to it didn't get it
3896.9,3899.9, Not one actually did that someone did come on
3904.1000000000004,3908.6200000000003, Everyone gaming took away in the room. I didn't know that Sega see
3912.9,3918.3, One game like that for some reason. I think it's another age thing cover command in the arcade the laser disk based one
3918.9,3920.4, Like oh man. I love that
3920.4,3926.5, I would play that it's tracking cheese all the time and then when like I went to the call California extreme to guard our old arcade game
3926.5,3929.34, Expo and they had it I couldn't believe that was the same game
3929.98,3931.98, God damn. I thought I was playing a cartoon
3931.98,3937.5, I know I used to play the hell it'll like the dragon's layer and the straight stage and all that other stuff and
3937.98,3942.78," Cliff hanger yeah, just basically looping the third but remember in college be hit a yeah a"
3942.94,3945.32, Tari party because no one had played in the Tari and like I
3945.98,3949.26, Repardy oh my god someone has an Atari 2600 like
3949.98,3950.98, 20 tapes
3950.98,3952.62, This will be games and more
3952.62,3955.08," Hey, I'll set it up and it's gonna talk on the party"
3955.08,3958.06, Like do you want to see at the do you call a tape?
3959.58,3961.94, We turned it on and like started
3961.98,3966.12, Playing I don't know God does what the superband game where maybe combat never it was just like
3966.86,3972.58," Really quiet this kind of sucks. Oh, yeah, that not one of them like we would be a Tari party"
3972.9,3975.98," Five. Yeah, it's a good to be a quimmer kind of a downer. There's very much a downer"
3975.98,3979.54, I did go through like 20 seconds was there alcohol involved in this Atari
3979.98,3985.88," Maybe I got better after that. Well, that's the thing now like we we saw it upon shop like a box with the you know a"
3985.88,3990.92, 6800 in it and some some games a bunch of games for like 10 bucks for like this is gonna be rad
3990.92,3993.52, I'll take it back just like on the way home
3993.52,3997.88," We're turning this all all these motherfuckers in the drink and games, you know like basketball"
3997.88,4001.96, You get it it's time to have a drink whatever whatever game it was you know
4001.96,4003.96, Superman you take falls into a pit
4004.96,4006.96, Some of these games actually they bear goggles
4008.96,4010.96, Venture I had you
4010.96,4015.04," Saying this shot just described you stipulated you're like oh, I remember these old times"
4015.2,4019.08, Then you just kind of get quiet because you don't really want to like announce to everyone that
4019.2400000000002,4021.2400000000002, Like you will sometimes suck
4021.48,4026.4, Dude you're as revenge drinking game. That's what we need not worried about not even funny though
4026.8,4029.64, Sounded funny that we were coming kind of bumming me out to talk about this
