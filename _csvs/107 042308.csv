16.0,17.0, You're a constant.
17.0,18.0, I don't know.
18.0,26.0, That that young man's voice was one of our two very special guests this week along with the two regular people.
26.0,27.0, I'm not that kind of special.
28.0,30.0, I was not short about special.
30.0,32.0," See, I was totally going to go there."
32.0,33.0, But there you go.
33.0,39.0, I maybe a stout long term one-up readers might actually already recognize those two voices.
39.0,40.0, I don't know.
40.0,41.0, Freaky.
41.0,46.0, But we'll introduce them in a moment after regular guests introduce themselves.
46.0,48.0, Ryan Scott and Sean Maloy.
48.0,52.0, Sean Elliott is sick and on vacation both.

66.0,68.0, That's the last item.
68.0,69.0," So, either he's..."
69.0,70.0," Well, maybe he's both."
70.0,72.0," So, there's a weird outbreak in the eastern sea board."
72.0,73.0," This probably, yeah."
73.0,74.0, Sean Elliott's fault.
74.0,75.0, Yeah.
75.0,78.0, You do kind of want to space out your excuses a little better.
78.0,79.0, Yes.

97.5,100.0, Maybe that can be the next one up contest.
100.0,102.0, Where are Sean and Hans?
102.0,104.0, Sean's like some bad mice-based series.
104.0,107.0, He's assuming he's going somewhere with Hans again.
107.0,110.0, Sending your answer and you'll win a Yorkie bar.

138.0,140.0, We like leaving our room.
140.0,144.0, We have an actual majority of CGW people now.
144.0,146.0," No, you were all on the same thing."
146.0,148.0," Yeah, your first issue, Sean, was..."
148.0,150.0, Right before GFW stories.
150.0,151.0, Did you have one issue of CGW?
151.0,152.0, Maybe three.
152.0,153.0, Yeah.
153.0,154.0, Okay.
154.0,156.0, Because you're all for the Splinter-Seld Double Agent one.

660.0,661.0, Yep.
661.0,662.0, And you had something like crazy.
662.0,667.0, Remark about how the first day I saw this stuff staff meeting and your air is all cut up for some weird reason that you're like.
667.0,669.0, I've been my van go face.
669.0,671.0, That's like how you're greeted me.
671.0,673.0," Oh, really?"
673.0,674.0, Yes.
674.0,677.0," Cut that around like you're a little bandage up and you're just like, what?"
677.0,679.0," Yeah, I know my van go face."
679.0,681.0, I don't remember that at all.
681.0,682.0, I cut my ear.
682.0,684.0, I never got the real story for me.
684.0,685.0, Just that's what you told me.
685.0,686.0, Okay.
686.0,687.0," And then you told and then either you,"
687.0,690.0," Ellie told me like, I don't know, go bring some boxes or something."
690.0,693.0," Yeah, you were definitely we had you slept and shit around."
693.0,696.0, Well he was an intern who at least did what he was told.
696.0,697.0, That's true.
697.0,701.0, We had interns in the future who did not do what they were trying.
701.0,702.0, Ryan.
702.0,703.0, What the hell?
703.0,706.0, But but scooter did.
706.0,710.0," Yeah, I was like, just this kid around hanging around."
710.0,711.0, It's a thousand trouble.
711.0,714.0," Yeah, you're my magic turns."
714.0,716.0," Yeah, with your elf over there."
716.0,717.0," Yeah, over there."
717.0,720.0," Yeah, you did actually, you did a lot of backseat gaming too."
720.0,723.0, Because you didn't really have like a place to sit and remember too.
723.0,725.0, So you were always having a helping around me and Ellie.
725.0,729.0, I learned that or take the death of someone who would like someone who just happened not be there that day.
729.0,730.0, It was like my desk for the day.
730.0,731.0, Right.
731.0,734.0, So you were there in the glory days of like 15 people on the staff.
734.0,737.0, You were member of 15 people that I'm actually not exaggerating.
737.0,738.0," No, it was there was a lot."
738.0,742.0," I mean, it was like, oh, but three or three for art people also."
742.0,745.0, And there's a lot of gaming and other total talking.
745.0,749.0," Yeah, a lot of art people to make those crazy flames that ran across the"
749.0,752.0, party page graphics card features.
752.0,755.0, A lot of art.
755.0,756.0, You're the knocking touch.
756.0,759.0, And the other and chief had an assistant.
759.0,761.0, That's the thing that they get to me.
761.0,762.0, That's crazy.
762.0,766.0," Yeah, actually, I was not like the director of like Sony PR and Europe or something like that."
766.0,767.0," Yeah, Charlotte Panther."
767.0,768.0, Wonderful person.
768.0,771.0," But yeah, he also had the time had an assistant."
771.0,775.0, But he just expenses and even answered the phone for him crazy.
775.0,776.0, Wow.
776.0,779.0, And I was technically her assistant technically like it was heard.
780.0,784.0, You were a ties her stuff as I in the apparently the ziff intern.
784.0,786.0," You know, org chart apparently."
786.0,788.0, I was like taster her in particular.
788.0,789.0, Huh.
789.0,792.0, You just said like asked like Jeff or Elliot what they need help with.
792.0,794.0, We didn't need help with shit.
794.0,796.0, We never did anything.
796.0,799.0, That was a great thing with 15 people on the staff.
799.0,800.0, Like wake all day.
800.0,802.0, 11 other people to do that.
802.0,803.0, You see what Ellie is building.
803.0,806.0, So as man is that one Ken was the managing editor.
806.0,807.0, Yeah.
807.0,808.0, And he was so cranky.
808.0,809.0, You guys all the time.
809.0,812.0," Well, I told the story in last six podcasts of when he busted."
812.0,814.0, I wait a nice for playing.
814.0,815.0, Might magic on deadline.
815.0,816.0, Yeah.
816.0,818.0," But you know, that's kind of been a pattern of your."
818.0,821.0, Climate at CGW is getting busted by your manager.
821.0,822.0, Excuse me.
822.0,823.0, I play games for a living.
823.0,828.0, There are three managing editors from managing editors of your sitting at the same.
828.0,829.0, That's true.
829.0,830.0, Yeah.
830.0,832.0, I could be crucified this very room.
832.0,833.0, Yeah.
833.0,834.0, I ain't going to.
834.0,836.0, I don't think anyone else took away his phone.
836.0,837.0, His phone cord.
837.0,838.0, His internet connection.
838.0,840.0, And that taped him into his office.
840.0,842.0," I was like, no, I'm not."
842.0,844.0, I don't think I ever did anything as hard core as that.
844.0,845.0, Yeah.
845.0,847.0," Actually, the great thing about that was you were not kidding."
847.0,848.0, No.
848.0,849.0, You were actually kind of genuinely.
849.0,852.0," Well, part of it was because people always go into your office."
852.0,853.0, Yes.
853.0,855.0, And I was trying to keep them out as much as I was trying to keep you in.
855.0,856.0, Right.
856.0,859.0," But then I also, I know you surf online all the time."
859.0,860.0, Because I was right.
860.0,863.0, I would usually send Jeff like a stupid link to like a low cat picture.
863.0,865.0," But hey, Jeff, you see the link is in it."
865.0,866.0, Yeah.
866.0,867.0, You want to me to stop doing that.
867.0,868.0, Yeah.
868.0,869.0," This is pretty long cats, but yeah."
869.0,870.0, Yeah.
870.0,871.0, I'm just giving people like a ride.
871.0,872.0, It was a kind of thing.
872.0,873.0, Yeah.
873.0,876.0, It probably would have been to forget like hamster dance.
876.0,877.0, That that.
877.0,878.0, Yeah.
878.0,879.0, It would have hamster dance.
879.0,880.0, But right.
880.0,881.0, Yeah.
881.0,884.0," I remember you storming in because I'm sure it was a green speak, right?"
884.0,885.0, That I'm sure.
885.0,886.0, That what it always is.
886.0,887.0, Yeah.
887.0,891.0," And a managed to miss not only like you turned to the green speak,"
891.0,893.0," but it not only missed like the deadline for that month,"
893.0,895.0, but it missed the deadline for the next month.
895.0,896.0, Yeah.
896.0,897.0, To.
897.0,898.0, Yeah.
898.0,901.0, She actually witnessed the one time when I laughed myself in late.
901.0,902.0, Yeah.
902.0,903.0, Yeah.
903.0,904.0, Yeah.
904.0,906.0," And then we would always, I would always say you would promise me you're like,"
906.0,908.0," No, I promise you it's going to begin tomorrow."
908.0,910.0," And then it'd be like, if not, you owe me a bottle of scotch."
910.0,912.0," And you'd be like, oh, it'll totally be in."
912.0,913.0, And then you would never get it in.
913.0,915.0, You owe me like 20 bottles of scotch.
915.0,916.0, I do.
916.0,917.0, You want to scotch.
917.0,919.0," And then ironically,"
919.0,924.0," the very last issue of GFW, I was going to turn it in."
924.0,925.0, I swear.
925.0,926.0, I know it sounds so empty.
926.0,927.0, I have three Nancy get it.
927.0,928.0, You're here.
928.0,929.0, Who can roll the ice?
929.0,930.0, I swear.
930.0,931.0, I swear.
931.0,932.0, I swear.
932.0,933.0, It's going to be on.
933.0,934.0, Yeah.
934.0,936.0, It was mostly written.
936.0,938.0, I can't say with air quotes.
938.0,942.0," The only time we didn't, you missed a deadline quote"
942.0,946.0," and quote was when you were heading to Monius, like as you had a."
946.0,947.0, That's true.
947.0,950.0, That's the one and a time when it actually did not even make the deadline.
950.0,951.0, It was very monic.
951.0,954.0," I saw you think, because that was when I was unemployed."
954.0,955.0, Yep.
955.0,957.0, Thanks to Zif no longer requiring my services.
957.0,959.0, And so I actually came over to bring you food.
959.0,960.0, You brought me soup.
960.0,961.0, I remember.
961.0,962.0, Because your wife and daughter were out of the.
962.0,963.0, Out of the country.
963.0,964.0, Yeah.
964.0,965.0, They left the country when I got in the Monius.
965.0,966.0, That was.
966.0,967.0," Well, no."
967.0,968.0, I was a lot of such.
968.0,969.0, With more pneumonia.
969.0,970.0, Yeah.
970.0,971.0," No, I'm kidding."
971.0,972.0, They did.
972.0,974.0," But yeah, you were, you were very, very, very ill."
974.0,975.0, Thank you.
975.0,976.0, Yeah.
977.0,979.0," Hey, you made you, you, you, you made a deadline today."
979.0,980.0, I did.
980.0,985.0," I made my very first, uh, I wrote my very first console review actually."
985.0,990.0," Oh, I was a, I was a we review for battle the bands and I made the deadline"
990.0,991.0, The deadline was today and I turned it in.
991.0,993.0, So all the internet will be good for you that way.
993.0,996.0, So all your PC staff are all the stuff you write for your nice.
996.0,997.0, You're worried.
997.0,999.0, You can't make a deadline.
999.0,1000.0, Just for your life.
1000.0,1001.0, I'll tell you.
1001.0,1002.0, And if you.
1002.0,1005.0," But this is, but this is common with writers and I was actually going to bring the stuff to"
1005.0,1010.0, the serious point and maybe you guys who made the transition from print to online already
1010.0,1012.0, at game tap can confirm.
1012.0,1017.0," And that's that I mean, the ageal thing you take the time a lot to you, right?"
1017.0,1018.0, Yeah.
1018.0,1023.0, I used to work on a weekly magazine and I never miss my deadline there because
1023.0,1026.0," Well, for one, you could have been a hard day for a week."
1026.0,1027.0, You could have been a hard day for a week.
1027.0,1028.0, You can have a hard day for a week.
1028.0,1029.0, Right.
1029.0,1033.0," But also it just, it was too, with a weekly and of course, the internet is much more,"
1033.0,1035.0," you know, it's not just daily."
1035.0,1043.0," It's like hourly, but the weekly made it impossible to miss because it would just pile on so fast that you would just be screwed for forever."
1043.0,1045.0, So you had to stay on deadline.
1045.0,1048.0," I mean, don't you find that working online?"
1048.0,1051.0, Like you see a demo and then you have to go write something up right there.
1051.0,1053.0," You have a pretty great, I mean, you were, how many previously?"
1053.0,1054.0, Because we did the Namco thing.
1054.0,1058.0, Like so scooting I went to the Namco event and I wrote up three articles from that.
1058.0,1062.0," Like the next day and you wrote up three as well, right?"
1062.0,1064.0," Yeah, like an RPG and something."
1064.0,1070.0, And then you went off to midway the day after that and then turned in all three pieces from like you saw that same day.
1070.0,1076.0," Like the next morning, like at nine, when I got up and I logged on and scooter and turned in all three of us."
1076.0,1079.0, See now I mentored scooters and procrastination.
1079.0,1080.0, I know that.
1080.0,1081.0, You have to do with both of you.
1081.0,1085.0, But now like it's slow to sleep in me like eating fat burger for one.
1085.0,1087.0," We're like, oh, I got to write about games."
1087.0,1088.0, Here you go.
1088.0,1089.0, I appreciate it.
1089.0,1090.0, I love the running man.
1090.0,1092.0, This has been for OPM or CGW.
1092.0,1094.0," Would you have no, I would still not be written."
1094.0,1095.0, Oh no.
1095.0,1096.0," No, I would be right."
1096.0,1098.0, I would have drank more and eat more fat burger.
1098.0,1099.0, Yeah.
1099.0,1103.0," Yeah, you let that window of like a media sea slip by and then it's a week later."
1103.0,1106.0," Well, yeah, we went to another event like a week,"
1106.0,1107.0, where when was that?
1107.0,1113.0, Like it was like a week and a half ago and the embargo is this Friday and we still have written any of the things.
1113.0,1116.0," Yeah, I just started like putting my notes onto the computer."
1116.0,1117.0," Yeah, I did."
1117.0,1126.0," I did a brief stand against bar after I got laid off and GDC flashy was actually my eye open for online versus print because I don't pay on the CW like,"
1126.0,1127.0," Oh yeah, I wanted to do see."
1127.0,1129.0," Yeah, I can think about stories."
1129.0,1132.0," Like, you know, maybe do a follow-up email and be like, oh, yeah, I got to write that."
1132.0,1133.0, Don't I?
1133.0,1134.0, I'm dead line.
1134.0,1136.0, That's like about two and a half weeks later.
1136.0,1139.0," GDC was like the first time like, I got to stay up to like three more and write to stupid"
1139.0,1141.0, that story because I got to get it.
1141.0,1142.0, Get down now.
1142.0,1143.0, Yep.
1143.0,1144.0, That was our future show.
1144.0,1145.0, I'm not.
1145.0,1147.0," Yeah, but then I did a pic, so you know, 200 work a week."
1147.0,1148.0, I was going to put littleɑ.
1148.0,1152.74," Hey, David, how was the journalist recently the Silcin mic and the"
1152.74,1154.74," speaker, who will señ, Bradet."
1154.74,1158.4, Certainly you look a little bit out of the way
1158.4,1162.4, Hum fly as I honestly not fath Not for me and also just redirecting your
1167.4,1169.64, things as you imagine.
1169.64,1170.88, I suppose well.
1170.88,1173.4," We also mentioned you know, the people in the"
1173.4,1175.0400000000002," after, yeah."
1175.0400000000002,1179.44," But even in the print only days, E3 was always hectic and a bit."
1179.44,1181.0800000000002," Well, hectic as far as appointments went,"
1181.0800000000002,1183.2800000000002, but then you didn't have to worry about going back that.
1183.2800000000002,1184.44, It was hectic with a point of minutes.
1184.44,1187.2, And that you got screwed when actually came deadline time
1187.2,1189.1200000000001, because realized all those rounds of it were playing off.
1189.1200000000001,1190.64," Now, or do now."
1190.64,1193.8000000000002," So basically, E3 for print person, I think at the time for me,"
1193.8000000000002,1197.0400000000002," was like a delayed, oh shit, I'm screwed effect."
1197.0400000000002,1200.0400000000002," Cause online, oh, I got right this night after I see it."
1200.0400000000002,1201.8000000000002," E3, I was like, I won't worry about for two weeks."
1201.8,1203.0, I won't write anything for two weeks.
1203.0,1205.04," And then when you guys come up like, oh, it's deadline."
1205.04,1206.24," Oh crap, I got through prison."
1206.24,1208.0, And you would do that at OPM all the time
1208.0,1210.44," because he was the, you scoop is the previews editor."
1210.44,1212.84," And ended up, I mean, everyone would write everything,"
1212.84,1215.04," but as a result, you would end up writing a lot of the previews."
1215.04,1217.36," And I'd be like, be like the Friday before,"
1217.36,1219.08, and would be shipping Monday to say Wednesday.
1219.08,1220.44," And I'm like, all right, scoop."
1220.44,1222.96," And then you would just like, it's like they don't look percolating"
1222.96,1223.56, in your head.
1223.56,1226.28," And then suddenly you would just go, and they would all be there."
1226.28,1227.6399999999999, And they'd be really good too.
1227.6399999999999,1230.9199999999998, My initial E3 experience was totally hectic.
1230.92,1233.64," And it was at a print magazine, but I was at Game Pro."
1233.64,1237.44, But E3 happened to fall right on our shipping days.
1237.44,1239.0800000000002, So we would pre-lay everything out.
1239.0800000000002,1241.48," And then we'd have to like, oh God, figure out"
1241.48,1243.52, any future right instantly.
1243.52,1245.3600000000001, So that's horrible.
1245.3600000000001,1246.3600000000001," Yeah, those were rough."
1246.3600000000001,1247.6000000000001, That was your first E3.
1247.6000000000001,1249.1200000000001," Then it was like three, the first three,"
1249.1200000000001,1250.68," three, is it always happened that gone?"
1250.68,1251.6000000000001, I don't know if it was on purpose.
1251.6000000000001,1254.48, I wasn't like pretty much the production schedule
1254.48,1255.44, or anything like that back then.
1255.44,1257.92," So I don't know, maybe it was like, decided,"
1257.92,1260.24, they decided to do that on purpose to like be super timely.
1260.24,1262.48, And we had something like that.
1262.48,1265.4," Yes, because the issue that you started,"
1265.4,1270.32," that's when I still issue, I remember having to like,"
1270.32,1273.1200000000001," well, the cover story had to be too art"
1273.1200000000001,1275.84," like the day before, like I got on my plane to E3"
1275.84,1277.84, because it had to like ship.
1277.84,1279.64," Oh, I remember that."
1279.64,1281.6," Yeah, yeah, I remember that."
1281.6,1283.04," And I was like the last one left,"
1283.04,1287.16, like specifically to edit the cover story.
1287.16,1287.6, Right.
1287.6,1291.3999999999999, So it was one of those crazy timing things.
1291.3999999999999,1292.6, I got so long time.
1292.6,1293.6, I'm going to agree.
1293.6,1296.9599999999998," I mean, you know, they have these pre-E3 events kind of to help"
1296.9599999999998,1297.6799999999998, you get it.
1297.6799999999998,1298.52, I'm going to the value of the way.
1298.52,1300.3999999999999, They started to do pre-pre-e3 events.
1300.3999999999999,1301.24, Half day really.
1301.24,1302.3999999999999, They put me in such a big place with the van.
1302.3999999999999,1304.32, The last week was basically like pre-pre-3.
1304.32,1306.04, And now you're going to have your pre-3 events
1306.04,1307.6399999999999," in the middle of May with like,"
1307.6399999999999,1308.56," yeah, the second."
1308.56,1309.56," No, no."
1309.56,1310.56, Sorry.
1310.56,1311.56, I remember my mic down.
1311.56,1313.76, You couldn't hear me talking.
1313.76,1317.1599999999999," Like the second week of May, there's like an in three days."
1317.16,1319.96, There are five companies to read three things.
1319.96,1321.64, And I don't like we're checking now
1321.64,1322.76, to see if they have embargoes.
1322.76,1325.0800000000002, So they're at least space out when you kind of up.
1325.0800000000002,1327.5600000000002," But the first one, they're like, no, I'm bargo."
1327.5600000000002,1331.0," We're like, I fucking hate pre-3."
1331.0,1333.3600000000001," And I just said, I hate it."
1333.3600000000001,1334.6000000000001," Yeah, I don't have it."
1334.6000000000001,1336.16, I don't know why and how it started.
1336.16,1338.0, I think EA was the first one to do it.
1338.0,1339.48, They would have their EA day.
1339.48,1340.64, They would have like the same idea.
1340.64,1343.28," So we're like, you'll have to see all of our games at E3."
1343.28,1345.24, So you can come see all that one before hand.
1345.24,1346.88, They have time to enjoy yourself.
1346.88,1349.24," Yeah, time to show yourself when you have to run"
1349.24,1351.3200000000002, up to this next event an hour later and see.
1351.3200000000002,1354.3200000000002," I have this time now for the theory would be that, yeah,"
1354.3200000000002,1356.3600000000001, they have you as a Captain audience for the whole day.
1356.3600000000001,1360.7600000000002, You can see everything that you would totally not even have a second
1360.7600000000002,1362.1200000000001, look at at E3 itself.
1362.1200000000001,1363.1200000000001, Right.
1363.1200000000001,1364.1200000000001, Yeah.
1364.1200000000001,1364.92, Which is why they often don't even try out it.
1364.92,1369.16," Like if you go to any EA, pre-3 event, they might not have"
1369.16,1372.0, like the spores and stuff because you know that you will take a look
1372.0,1373.0, at that.
1373.0,1375.2," But they'll have the cultural Zanthor at, yes."
1375.2,1376.2, Yeah.
1376.2,1379.56, Spring I would spend all day with cultural Zanthor.
1379.56,1383.1200000000001," Somebody in the, and what's his face who likes his cheese?"
1383.1200000000001,1384.1200000000001, Oh.
1384.1200000000001,1385.76, I don't even remember the thing about that.
1385.76,1386.76, It was a wrap.
1386.76,1387.76, I love that great.
1387.76,1388.76, Yeah.
1388.76,1392.0," But Daxi was, what languages are using?"
1392.0,1393.0, Was your Swedish?
1393.0,1396.2," Yeah, I used to Swedish, English, dictionary, and that actually"
1396.2,1397.2, been vomit.
1397.2,1402.72, Nobody actually bothered to see if those people thought the
1402.72,1403.72, preview was real.
1403.76,1407.68, I know that was the both beautiful and scary things.
1407.68,1410.52, I did notice there's a thread on quarter to three or people were talking
1410.52,1413.16," about are we going to rename this podcast and some, I don't know"
1413.16,1416.48," if you saw the scooter, but somebody suggested radio freeze and Thor."
1417.84,1418.96, Which made me happy.
1418.96,1419.72, Like that.
1419.72,1420.64," Yeah, I like that too."
1420.64,1424.08, She has to tell you is not the catchiest of acronyms.
1424.08,1426.3600000000001," So it's not, but that's kind of what we're known as."
1426.3600000000001,1426.84, Yeah.
1426.84,1427.16, Yeah.
1427.16,1427.3600000000001, Yeah.
1427.3600000000001,1429.56, Kind of like that or crazy brand listing.
1429.56,1430.56, Huh?
1431.52,1434.28," I was saying, GFW, I think other you guys are like a bizarre"
1434.28,1435.2, Craigslist acronym.
1435.9199999999998,1437.32," Oh, like, look, what did you do?"
1437.32,1438.12," Yeah, what did you do?"
1438.12,1438.6, Yeah.
1438.6,1439.9199999999998, I do whatever I don't do.
1439.9199999999998,1441.52," It's Craigslist, whatever you wanted to mean."
1441.52,1441.72, Yeah.
1441.72,1442.56, Okay.
1442.56,1443.56, Yeah.
1443.56,1443.96, Yeah.
1443.96,1444.8, That's who we are.
1444.8,1447.8, I think that I've already made my one offensive comment.
1447.8,1448.8," Oh, my."
1448.8,1449.3999999999999, I'm so happy.
1449.3999999999999,1449.8, I'm guessing.
1449.8,1450.6399999999999, Yes.
1450.6399999999999,1451.6399999999999, For the decade.
1451.6399999999999,1452.56," Yeah, maybe so."
1452.56,1453.44, Yeah.
1453.44,1454.28, That's okay.
1454.28,1455.04," Yeah, racist."
1456.0,1457.0, Yeah.
1457.0,1458.0, Yeah.
1458.0,1459.0, Scooter.
1459.0,1464.0, I wanted to share one of the thing which was the origin story
1464.0,1465.6, of your name.
1465.6,1467.72, It's not everybody in the industry know set.
1467.72,1469.6399999999999, I don't think I don't think I know this either.
1469.6399999999999,1474.6399999999999," See, this is a man who's been in the gaming industry for over 10 years now."
1474.6399999999999,1479.32, And is known by most people just by that acronym.
1479.32,1479.92, It's not a acronym.
1479.92,1480.92, Not acronym.
1480.92,1481.92, Nick Nick.
1481.92,1482.52, Nick.
1482.52,1483.12, Nick.
1483.12,1484.12, Nick.
1484.8799999999999,1487.3999999999999, It's been a while.
1487.3999999999999,1489.12, It's been a while.
1489.12,1490.9599999999998," No, I'm not going to get bad."
1490.9599999999998,1491.9599999999998, I'm going to get bad.
1491.9599999999998,1493.12, Okay.
1493.12,1497.04, I just have a really difficult name to look to pronounce because I have like a French
1497.04,1502.32, and Vietnamese name and high school is not very fun being like Syrian Newgain.
1502.32,1504.4799999999998, A lot of time.
1504.4799999999998,1509.8799999999999," So Johnny and TC and I think Cannon Dave at the end of the town were like, yeah, this"
1509.8799999999999,1511.1599999999999, is going to work out with the call you.
1511.1599999999999,1512.1599999999999, And also the TC.
1512.2,1515.68, I don't know that they couldn't find me bothered to figure out a single name.
1515.68,1517.68," Because also, we call this guy."
1517.68,1518.68, Sorry.
1518.68,1521.24, Some of them was even though one of them even had the same name.
1521.24,1522.24, That was it.
1522.24,1523.24, You know what?
1523.24,1526.0800000000002," You know, either we write called Terricolman TC."
1526.0800000000002,1530.0400000000002," It's like, we can't have two terries on staff because you know, it's like, well,"
1530.0400000000002,1531.76, what am I really called by other thing?
1531.76,1533.72, And also you are a kid.
1533.72,1536.44," You know, other kid and I was like, I guess in the future,"
1536.44,1538.8400000000001," and part of it was like, yes, the name."
1538.8400000000001,1541.72, I heard conflict with the things like Dave's that is came from the fact that I
1541.72,1543.04, zipped on the office like as well.
1543.04,1544.56, I was on a scooter.
1544.56,1546.44, John is a red con.
1546.44,1547.44, And John.
1547.44,1548.44, John.
1548.44,1552.64," John, TC says because scooter was the intern to curman on the Muppet show."
1552.64,1557.2," Oh, and that I looked like him because I had the glasses and like the non-white"
1557.2,1558.2, complexion at the.
1558.2,1559.2, Yes.
1559.2,1561.8, It was quite an novelty at the time.
1561.8,1562.8, Wow.
1562.8,1563.8, Yeah.
1563.8,1564.8, Crazy.
1564.8,1565.8, Yeah.
1565.8,1566.8, Those were the super.
1566.8,1567.8, We have a minority on staff.
1567.8,1568.8, Those were the two of us are hurt.
1568.8,1569.8, And that they just used it to say it.
1569.8,1570.96, They're sure how to refer to me.
1570.96,1574.24," And like someone's on a conference like John and TC on a conference call,"
1574.24,1577.0," some peer person and they heard them say like, hey, screw, go get this copy of the"
1577.0,1578.0, game.
1578.0,1579.0," Oh, who's that?"
1579.0,1579.6399999999999," I was like, oh, that's our intern."
1579.6399999999999,1582.56," It's like, oh, that's much easier than actual name."
1582.56,1585.52, So that's how I like I got leaked out to everyone just saying when they was
1585.52,1586.52, screwing.
1586.52,1589.24," See, and you were smart enough to just go with the flow and accept scooter because"
1589.24,1591.6, there were interns after that who complained about the.
1591.6,1594.44, One in particular and then received much force.
1594.44,1595.44, Right.
1595.44,1596.44, So right.
1596.44,1598.12, A later intern was.
1599.04,1601.1999999999998, Because then it became kind of a tradition.
1601.1999999999998,1603.3999999999999," Yeah, because Ryan was animal for a while."
1603.3999999999999,1604.3999999999999, That's right.
1604.3999999999999,1606.3999999999999," Yeah, that never stuck too well."
1606.3999999999999,1606.9199999999998, We came.
1606.9199999999998,1607.9199999999998, We did.
1607.9199999999998,1608.6399999999999, But it was one of the better ones.
1608.6399999999999,1610.12, It was animal was good.
1610.12,1611.4399999999998," But yeah, we did have it."
1611.4399999999998,1615.04, And the other net was we decided was junior.
1615.04,1616.56, We started calling him junior.
1616.56,1619.1599999999999," And he really, he not only did he object to it."
1619.1599999999999,1620.1599999999999, He objected to it.
1620.1599999999999,1623.12, And he kind of really don't appreciate being called junior.
1623.12,1624.1599999999999, Robert coffee.
1624.1599999999999,1625.1599999999999, Robert coffee.
1625.1599999999999,1626.1599999999999, Exactly.
1626.16,1629.4, Robert coffee does not react well to that kind of thing.
1629.4,1630.8000000000002," Oh, you don't like that."
1630.8000000000002,1633.28, How about this?
1633.28,1637.44," And from then on, he was known as chim chim named after these very same monkey"
1637.44,1639.0400000000002, that's going to be in speed race.
1639.0400000000002,1640.0400000000002, Speed race.
1640.0400000000002,1641.16, Come with the theaters for you.
1641.16,1642.16, Yeah.
1642.16,1646.6000000000001," But so scooter, you got name that there was actually a formal naming ceremony."
1646.6000000000001,1647.6000000000001, Do you remember that?
1647.6000000000001,1648.6000000000001, Seriously?
1648.6000000000001,1649.6000000000001," Yeah, that was a meeting."
1649.6000000000001,1654.3200000000002, Because that's what it was like in the Johnny Wilson's Wilson day to go.
1654.3200000000002,1655.3200000000002, We did.
1655.32,1657.0," Yeah, we're having a net at meeting."
1657.0,1659.0, And he was great.
1659.0,1661.0, He was great at like grandstanding.
1661.0,1662.0, Please a minute.
1662.0,1663.0, I remember him in other.
1663.0,1664.0, I remember him in other.
1664.0,1665.6799999999998," I don't remember that one in particular, actually."
1665.6799999999998,1666.6799999999998," Oh, yeah."
1666.6799999999998,1671.3999999999999," He got up there and he's like, and so we have a new intern upon us."
1671.3999999999999,1673.08, And so he shall be named.
1673.08,1674.36," You know, went on and on like that."
1674.36,1675.36, And he called you.
1675.36,1679.08, He said you were dubbed scooter and he gave you a beanie propeller hat that he put
1679.08,1680.08, on.
1680.08,1681.08, Wow.
1681.08,1682.08, I remember the hat.
1682.08,1683.08, I'm probably black.
1683.08,1684.08, I'm probably black.
1684.08,1685.08, I'm probably black.
1685.12,1688.08," It's a really talented, a very well-to-plocked."
1688.08,1689.56, That's what it is.
1689.56,1693.48," And then when I started at CGW, you had just become a full-time employee."
1693.48,1695.96, Because you just graduated from Cal like that may.
1695.96,1699.1999999999998," It was after it was like, right after Jeff, I just assumed."
1699.1999999999998,1701.04," Because yeah, you became ESC no one."
1701.04,1702.04, And that's right.
1702.04,1704.1599999999999," Yeah, I came in in September, 01."
1704.1599999999999,1705.1599999999999, Right.
1705.1599999999999,1706.1599999999999, That's right.
1706.1599999999999,1709.6," Because I was managed by like, I went through Johnny and George and you."
1709.6,1713.6," Yes, all the intern chiefs left after dealing with you."
1713.84,1714.6, Wow.
1714.6,1719.9199999999998," Yeah, I'm going to say something about your early days."
1719.9199999999998,1720.9199999999998, I don't remember.
1720.9199999999998,1721.9199999999998, Yeah.
1721.9199999999998,1726.7199999999998," I just remember coming into that for, because I came in not from the gaming side at all."
1726.7199999999998,1728.52, I was a magazine person.
1728.52,1730.6," You were one of the serious, like, on gaming."
1730.6,1736.08," What you guys in the shape and that first meeting, that first Monday morning meeting was"
1736.08,1737.08, like petrifying.
1737.08,1739.6799999999998," I was like, what have I done?"
1739.6799999999998,1740.6799999999998, What?
1740.6799999999998,1741.6799999999998, What am I here?
1741.68,1744.04, And all these acronyms that I've never heard before.
1744.04,1745.04," Like, RPG."
1745.04,1747.04," Yeah, I was like, I don't know."
1747.04,1749.0, It's going to be on here and what do you do this?
1749.0,1752.6000000000001," And you're like, you were like hyper hyper."
1752.6000000000001,1757.6000000000001, And then I have Tom Price and Will and Meal and Jason Babler.
1757.6000000000001,1758.6000000000001," There's a scary, good philosophy."
1758.6000000000001,1761.04," Robert Poffey, Ken Brown."
1761.04,1766.04," In fact, I in the job interview, I had to warn you because Dana was, she was on the"
1766.04,1771.3600000000001," night floor, which is where the serious, serious, serious, serious, serious, serious, serious"
1771.84,1773.6, Dana worked at smart business.
1773.6,1777.08," No, I believe it was Zif Davis smart business for the new economy."
1777.08,1779.4399999999998, That was Zif Davis smart business for the new economy.
1779.4399999999998,1784.04," No, because they decided PC computing wasn't good enough."
1784.04,1785.04, So they changed it.
1785.04,1788.7199999999998," Well, they wanted it to be smart business, but there was already a smart business magazine"
1788.7199999999998,1789.7199999999998, out there.
1789.7199999999998,1793.56," So then they had to put the Zif Davis in front, and they added the for the new economy tagline."
1793.56,1794.56, So ZDSB FTNE.
1794.56,1795.56," Seriously, yeah."
1795.56,1798.3999999999999," Oh, it goes off the tongue."
1798.3999999999999,1799.3999999999999, Anyway.
1799.3999999999999,1800.3999999999999, Yeah.
1800.44,1803.44," From there, and she came down to interview and she was wearing her like nice business"
1803.44,1804.44, clothes.
1804.44,1805.44, I had to warn.
1805.44,1808.44," And by that, you mean not jeans and a free t-shirt."
1808.44,1810.72," Yes, that is what I mean."
1810.72,1811.72, Yeah.
1811.72,1816.76," I had to, I had to warn the fellows, a lady was coming down to the floor."
1816.76,1817.76, Fright job interview.
1817.76,1818.76, Wow.
1818.76,1819.76, Please pull your pants up.
1819.76,1820.76, Yeah.
1820.76,1823.76," The list, that was one of my kids."
1823.76,1824.96," You were scared of that door, right?"
1824.96,1826.3200000000002, You were scared about hiring me.
1826.3200000000002,1830.3600000000001," Well, we had the job interview, and I had the, like that's, I think that was a"
1830.36,1831.36, big part of the interview.
1831.36,1836.0," I was like, you know, it's a little unorthodox down here."
1836.0,1839.8799999999999, Certain languages used.
1839.8799999999999,1841.08, We're not that professional.
1841.08,1846.4799999999998," I'm just saying, and you had the best possible answer, and it's actually why, because"
1846.4799999999998,1849.4799999999998," I interviewed a lot of people, and it's totally why you got to jump."
1849.4799999999998,1852.12, And it is that I used to teach you in your high.
1852.12,1853.12, Yep.
1853.12,1854.12, Perfect.
1854.12,1855.12, Yeah.
1855.12,1856.12, Yeah.
1856.12,1858.12, So you know exactly what you're getting into.
1858.12,1859.12, Yeah.
1859.1599999999999,1862.3999999999999," Well, I'm sorry, it's a nerd."
1862.3999999999999,1864.4799999999998, I just didn't know that much about being a specific nerd.
1864.4799999999998,1865.4799999999998," No, I know."
1865.4799999999998,1866.4799999999998, Yeah.
1866.4799999999998,1884.8," It's a, it terrifies me when I stop and think about how much stuff there is in my brain."
1884.8,1888.6399999999999, That was not there a mere seven years ago.
1888.72,1889.64, So mere.
1889.64,1890.64, Yeah.
1890.64,1891.64, It's a lot of time.
1891.64,1892.64, Yeah.
1892.64,1893.64, Yep.
1893.64,1894.64, So there you go.
1894.64,1895.64, Yep.
1895.64,1901.0," And now you're one of the, there's still not that many women, uh, gaming journalists"
1901.0,1902.0, types.
1902.0,1903.0, Yeah.
1903.0,1905.0, I can think of three.
1905.0,1907.0," There's Fran who runs, uh, a lot of some."
1907.0,1908.0, Chris Den.
1908.0,1909.0, He's great.
1909.0,1911.2800000000002," Chris and Salvador are former, uh, him."
1911.2800000000002,1912.2800000000002, He's in the same.
1912.2800000000002,1915.16, And that's all I can think of.
1915.16,1917.16, Not that many.
1917.16,1918.16, Yeah.
1918.16,1919.52," Well, I mean, I can think of a few."
1919.52,1920.52, Yeah.
1920.52,1921.52, I'm not even going to go down there.
1921.52,1924.16, Anyone who else who writes about.
1924.16,1925.16," Since then, I can think of you."
1925.16,1926.16, Yeah.
1926.16,1927.16, Or all smarter than us.
1927.16,1930.28, You really should just like defect and form your own magazine.
1930.28,1933.16," And then we could call it girl with like, no, excuse me."
1933.16,1934.16, Two or seven.
1934.16,1936.16, So I might not recommend the same magazine.
1936.16,1939.16, Best in this business at this country in time.
1939.16,1941.16, You think we don't know that.
1941.16,1942.16, Yeah.
1942.16,1946.16, Not of the magazines that I've worked at exist anymore.
1946.16,1947.16, Go figure.
1947.16,1948.16, There you go.
1948.16,1950.16," I said, yeah, I guess I could say that the two."
1950.16,1951.16," Oh, that was kind of funny."
1951.16,1955.16," Actually, after you guys shut down, Scooter totally put out a rumor that games have"
1955.16,1958.16, at it was getting shut down because of your Facebook.
1958.16,1963.16," Because people, I said, I said, I'll say it was like my first job is now shutting down."
1963.16,1966.16," And people were supposed to have a, at my game that I like first job."
1966.16,1968.16," No, I worked for another place."
1968.16,1970.16, Then we actually ran into Garnet like the next day at a thing.
1970.16,1972.16," And he was like, so you guys are losing your jobs."
1972.16,1973.16," And we were like, no."
1973.16,1974.16, Stupid thing.
1975.16,1976.16, Look.
1976.16,1979.16, And I will stick to the same things like Scourry's eating jelly beans right now.
1979.16,1982.16, I've got a lot of company for us.
1982.16,1984.16, I love Facebook.
1984.16,1986.16," So you're actually, guys, they're pretty sad."
1986.16,1989.16," I'm game tap owned by Warner Brothers, right?"
1989.16,1990.16, Only by Turner.
1990.16,1991.16, Turner.
1991.16,1992.16, Turner.
1992.16,1993.16, And Turner.
1993.16,1994.16, They won a brother time Warner.
1994.16,1995.16," Yeah, time to see Warner."
1995.16,1996.16, I got one.
1996.16,1999.16, Warner Brothers is all those movie people.
1999.16,2001.16," And Anthony will please time, ain't because all that stuff."
2001.16,2002.16, So you're not going anywhere.
2003.16,2007.16, It was pretty crazy because we are the only like almost all of Turner is in Atlanta.
2007.16,2009.16, So we are the West Coast based.
2009.16,2011.16," So I mean, there's like eight of us in an office here."
2011.16,2012.16, So we're tiny.
2012.16,2014.16," I mean, there are a couple of satellite scene offices."
2014.16,2017.16," But yeah, we're everything is also that land."
2017.16,2018.16, But one way went to Atlanta.
2018.16,2020.16," It was just like, okay."
2020.16,2021.16, Wow.
2021.16,2023.16," I mean, there's a lot of scene."
2023.16,2026.16," That's a center, which is basically like a mall in an office put together."
2026.16,2027.16, Right.
2027.16,2028.16, I just seen that building.
2028.16,2031.16," And the Turner campus, we're just five buildings that was built on like,"
2031.16,2033.16, a tenter is old plantation that he bought.
2033.16,2034.16, Yeah.
2034.16,2036.16," I just, the Turner's house into like a,"
2036.16,2037.16," Yes, a plantation."
2037.16,2038.16," Well, he bought plants."
2038.16,2041.16, He bought like 27 acres in the middle of the land.
2041.16,2043.16, I like the thing you actually have someone.
2043.16,2045.16, Maybe someone may want to tell.
2045.16,2046.16, Yeah.
2046.16,2047.16," Excuse me, Mr. Turner."
2047.16,2049.16, We lost that war.
2049.16,2050.16, Yeah.
2050.16,2052.16, So yeah.
2052.16,2054.16," I mean, it was pretty insane to go."
2054.16,2055.16, Okay. Yeah.
2055.16,2056.16, The company that we work for.
2056.16,2057.16, Pretty big.
2057.16,2059.16," Actually, our company actually owns Casa Blanca."
2060.16,2061.16, Yeah.
2061.16,2063.16, Turner is actually the city.
2063.16,2064.16," No, the movie."
2064.16,2065.16, Yeah.
2065.16,2066.16, I'm sorry.
2066.16,2068.16," No, but I, I'm probably the movie."
2068.16,2069.16, I'm probably the movie.
2069.16,2070.16, I'm probably the movie.
2070.16,2071.16," Oh, and by Turner."
2071.16,2073.16," Actually, that was part of the reason why one of the,"
2073.16,2074.16," that's part of the, like, one of the,"
2074.16,2076.16, Turner at some point is because of all the movie.
2076.16,2077.16," I mean, like, when that was a movie."
2077.16,2078.16, So it was just something crazy.
2078.16,2079.16, There's a vault.
2079.16,2081.16," There's a vault Atlanta that has like, yeah, like,"
2081.16,2083.16," 10,000 original movie."
2083.16,2084.16, Yeah.
2084.16,2085.16, And it's like the X-Fart on.
2085.16,2086.16, It's all to.
2086.16,2087.16, Yeah.
2087.16,2089.16, And we were also warned when we started.
2089.16,2091.16," We were warned very specifically about,"
2091.16,2093.16," which I remember when this happened with us,"
2093.16,2097.16, like about not taking anything using anything that was a copyright issue.
2097.16,2101.16, Because time Warner super interested because they own more copyrights than anyone else.
2101.16,2103.16," One of the biggest, I think, in the world."
2103.16,2107.16, So do you guys get free cable or something or what kind of perks do you get?
2107.16,2109.16," You got some, but I think, I think it depends."
2109.16,2112.16, I think those are more for actual.
2112.16,2114.16," And like, if your thing says time Warner,"
2114.16,2117.16, I don't know if you think of the puzzle.
2117.16,2118.16, Yeah.
2118.16,2119.16, Yeah.
2119.16,2122.16," It's like, in Atlanta, like a lot of the perks are associated with the location too."
2122.16,2123.16, Yeah.
2123.16,2125.16," Like, a parallel, like, we get a lot of free food at the scene in the center."
2125.16,2128.16," And like, we get discounts on all at the cartoon networks."
2128.16,2130.16," I think it's a discount on my cell phone bill, though."
2130.16,2131.16, That's nice.
2131.16,2132.16, Yeah.
2132.16,2133.16, Yeah.
2133.16,2134.16, Because time Warner's subscription to GameCap.
2134.16,2136.16," Uh, I get a free subscription to GameCap."
2136.16,2137.16, Good.
2137.16,2138.16, Indeed.
2138.16,2139.16, Yeah.
2139.16,2142.16," I mean, well, you know, time Warner has 80,000 employees, something like that."
2142.16,2147.16," So, they're able to negotiate pretty good for a lot of things just based on that number alone."
2147.16,2152.16," Man, you can really just kind of slide into the surface, sir, with 80,000 co-workers."
2152.16,2154.16, You can totally just let you walk off.
2154.16,2155.16, Okay.
2155.16,2156.16, And it's my treat.
2156.16,2157.16, No one notices me here.
2157.16,2158.16, Just goes to the wall.
2158.16,2160.16, Exactly.
2160.16,2161.16, I think I'll watch TV.
2161.16,2168.16," But it is crazy when we get the, like, company emails about, you know, congratulating HBO and other Emmy wins the night before."
2168.16,2169.16," Oh, like, that's weird."
2169.16,2171.16," Or like, good, congratulations."
2171.16,2173.16," Well, you line for their Oscar nominated."
2173.16,2174.16," Well, like, you won't go big."
2174.16,2175.16, You line to the Warner Bros.
2175.16,2176.16, Family Proper.
2176.16,2177.16, Yeah.
2177.16,2180.16," When you like a convert to a WB property, not just a few bites."
2180.16,2181.16, That's so interesting.
2181.16,2186.16," Do they ever, congratulations to Terrain Nguyen on his face monkey's preview?"
2186.16,2187.16, The little black hat.
2187.16,2189.16," Hi, I wrote Space Shamps."
2189.16,2193.16," So, I did a little bit like, you know, it'll be content."
2193.16,2198.16," They'll be like, it's a kind of contest to like win like the wire box set, which I always didn't win."
2198.16,2203.16," But like, win like the wire paraphernal, like, you know, teachers from this night."
2203.16,2206.16, It's been half an asset and like done entire season.
2206.16,2209.16," But I had to my name in it and like, I'm not listening to name of winners."
2209.16,2210.16, I'll last them sad.
2210.16,2212.16," Although, it's a web like, congratulations."
2212.16,2217.16, Terrain Nguyen of Game Tap slash Turner San Bruno for winning all this wire black.
2217.16,2219.16," So, do they know who you guys are?"
2219.16,2220.16, It's going to be a lot of fun.
2220.16,2221.16," Well, I mean, Wolf."
2221.16,2223.16, I think other people with it.
2223.16,2225.16, We tried visiting Larry King.
2225.16,2226.16, Yeah.
2226.16,2228.16," He's a New York, not in like, Anderson."
2228.16,2230.16, You're a first name basis without these guys.
2230.16,2232.16, Wolf is the default one that we jumped out.
2232.16,2234.16," Yeah, Wolf for Aaron's influence."
2234.16,2237.16," Or like, oh, Wolf got my paycheck by axe."
2237.16,2238.16, I got together for him.
2238.16,2239.16, Yeah.
2239.16,2240.16," Or hey, can't catch up."
2240.16,2241.16, Just drop by the situation.
2241.16,2242.16," Yeah, I asked Larry King."
2242.16,2244.16," Hey, you're going to go with the expense of King."
2244.16,2245.16, Get my expense for Porto.
2245.16,2246.16, We're Larry.
2246.16,2247.16, Yeah.
2247.16,2248.16, I don't like that guy.
2248.16,2250.16," No, I've got I watched his recap of the glowing glow."
2250.16,2251.16, This is pretty terrible.
2251.16,2252.16, Larry King.
2252.16,2253.16, Larry King.
2253.16,2254.16, Larry King.
2254.16,2255.16, Can't believe it.

2432.2400000000002,2433.08, flavored cases.
2433.08,2434.6, I was eating for our kindness.
2434.6,2435.28, Chomping away.
2435.28,2438.84, Although actually now that we've all heard off camera how much Ryan
2438.84,2442.32, weighs were actively encouraging to eat more candy.
2442.32,2444.8, You're a thin fellow.

2451.6800000000003,2453.1600000000003," God, that's it."
2453.1600000000003,2455.8," Because Jeff, I use a toy ball."
2455.8,2456.8, That's just a face.
2456.8,2457.8, You're young.
2457.8,2458.96, I told you we'll count on you.
2458.96,2459.8, It's the kids.
2459.8,2460.8, You're not having the kids.
2460.8,2461.96, That's there you got scared.
2461.96,2467.32," And then now I'm just like, man, I gain and I'm like slower than my first"
2467.32,2470.6800000000003," first food like, like, playing to and left."
2470.6800000000003,2473.28," So, weight gain has affected your speed in games."
2473.28,2474.32," Well, they'll just ate."
2474.32,2475.32," Oh, yeah."
2475.32,2476.32," Oh, yeah."
2476.32,2477.32, Yeah.
2477.96,2478.1600000000003, Yeah.
2478.1600000000003,2480.56, My costume's just that one low and my agility.
2480.56,2483.92, Next three went down as well.
2483.92,2484.28, No way.
2484.28,2485.1200000000003, Yeah.
2485.1200000000003,2485.6400000000003," No, no."
2485.6400000000003,2486.0800000000004," No, no."
2486.0800000000004,2487.48," Jeff's talking about like, I'm trying to play FDF."
2487.48,2488.6000000000004," I was like, what the hell?"
2488.6000000000004,2490.28, I guess she worked shit now.
2490.28,2491.28, Yeah.
2491.28,2492.28, I told you.
2492.28,2493.28, Welcome to my world.
2493.28,2494.28, Yeah.
2494.28,2497.84, I did some trick in the other day that made me think of you.
2497.84,2501.32, So I don't know if anyone else watches a no reservations ever.
2501.32,2504.0800000000004, Anthony Bourdain show on travel channel.
2504.08,2508.64, He did a thing where he was going to go back to his restaurant because he doesn't actually
2508.64,2510.0, cook anymore.
2510.0,2514.44, And he was having like the worst time because he couldn't read the tickets anymore.
2514.44,2517.64," And he was just like, he had to have people start reading him off and make me think"
2517.64,2518.64, of you.
2518.64,2520.64," He was like, I had this problem actually."
2520.64,2526.12, He was reading a meta-ger solid twin snake to what's it called twin six.
2526.12,2527.12, Yeah.
2527.12,2528.72, I've been playing it on the game queue by mentioned before.
2528.72,2533.2," Ryan, like, you told me just a few days ago that you finally got past the first room."
2533.2799999999997,2534.2, I did.
2534.2,2535.2, I don't know.
2535.2,2536.2, We did.
2536.2,2537.2, I beat the first room.
2537.2,2538.2, I beat the ball for a lot.
2538.2,2539.2, And I beat him.
2539.2,2540.2, Farron Square.
2540.2,2541.2, I did not cheat.
2541.2,2544.4399999999996," But what's then happened was I got to the part of the game where there's actually, I guess"
2544.4399999999996,2548.6," it's a copy protection thing or whatever, where you have to look at the back of the box"
2548.6,2550.8799999999997, to input a code.
2550.8799999999997,2553.64, And I literally couldn't see it.
2553.64,2555.2," I mean, I knew it was there."
2555.2,2556.12, I knew where it was.
2556.12,2559.7999999999997, I could see the screen and I could not read it at all.
2559.7999999999997,2561.12, So I had to go to GameFacts.
2561.12,2567.56," I think that code that code I've made around like, I think it's 1 4 0.81."
2567.56,2568.56, It might be.
2568.56,2569.56, It's definitely 1 4 0.
2569.56,2571.56," Oh, I mean, I'm pretty fine."
2571.56,2572.56, Pretty much Ryan.
2572.56,2574.56," Oh, I think all 1 4 0."
2574.56,2575.56," Hardly, aren't, wasn't cool."
2575.56,2576.56, Okay.
2576.56,2578.88," For zero anyways, but yeah, it's a, it's a certain code."
2578.88,2580.3599999999997, I think that was 1 5.
2580.3599999999997,2581.56, You could be right back in the day.
2581.56,2582.56, Scoot.
2582.56,2583.56," You remember that off the top of your head, too."
2583.56,2584.56," Yeah, we beat the."
2584.56,2586.56," Yeah, the scoot matrix we used to call it."
2586.56,2588.6, My boy's psycho-pedia scootopolis.
2588.6,2589.8399999999997, I wouldn't use Google.
2589.84,2592.08," I would just say, it's the case."
2592.08,2593.08, And I'll.
2593.08,2597.1600000000003," Yeah, before the internet there was scooter."
2597.1600000000003,2598.1600000000003, It was quite incredible.
2598.1600000000003,2599.96, It's actually what the internet is based on.
2599.96,2602.8, Wikipedia is a direct download from scooters head.
2602.8,2607.08," What's funny is that one of the, one of the guys that my husband used to work with"
2607.08,2609.1200000000003," is also a total, total comic book nerd."
2609.1200000000003,2612.1600000000003, And he would always hear stories from Brian about you.
2612.1600000000003,2614.84, And he totally wanted to like take you on an attribute challenge.
2614.84,2616.6800000000003," Because he was like, oh, I could totally beat scooter."
2616.6800000000003,2617.6800000000003, I totally know.
2617.6800000000003,2618.92," And I was like, now, probably now."
2619.0,2620.4," I was like, Jerome, there's no way."
2620.4,2621.2000000000003, There's no way.
2621.2000000000003,2622.8, He was just all fired up.
2622.8,2628.56," So scooter, you have a child now who's how old, two, two, and has that change."
2628.56,2632.8," You're your gaming habits or the other day, she tried to imitate Ninja Gaiden."
2632.8,2635.96," Because I was playing Ninja Gaiden, she grabbed the Wii Moans swinging around like a sore."
2635.96,2637.96," They say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2637.96,2639.76, Did she like grab the grade?
2639.76,2640.76, Did she grab it?
2640.76,2641.76, It wasn't doing anything.
2641.76,2645.2000000000003, So they she grabbed a second controller like sat next to me and like was pressing buttons.
2645.2000000000003,2646.36," I'm like, oh, crap."
2646.36,2648.44, She's aware what's going on the screen right now.
2648.52,2650.16, I got watch like watching now.
2650.16,2650.68, Yep.
2650.68,2653.36," No more Robo cough, pants, lab rinse."
2654.36,2655.16, Yeah.
2655.16,2658.52," I watched all of those from earlier like, oh, well, when they're that little, it doesn't matter."
2658.52,2660.56," Yeah, there is a point where you when they start imitate."
2660.56,2661.4," Yeah, what is that age?"
2661.4,2662.4, Fuck.
2662.4,2663.4," Oh, shit."
2663.4,2664.4," Oh, no."

2675.12,2675.68, Very awkward.
2675.68,2676.52, That's hard.
2676.52,2677.88, That's hard warming.
2677.88,2678.88, Yeah.
2678.88,2685.44," Yeah, Sarah used to sit on my lap when she was that age when I played, well, pretty much any"
2685.44,2690.32," sort of game, but there definitely became a point where her as her awareness picked up, I"
2690.32,2693.0, I let her do it less because I did not want her to.
2693.0,2697.7200000000003," So what what age was like then the cutoff for like, all right, now it's says to me street"
2697.7200000000003,2698.7200000000003, only.
2698.7200000000003,2700.44, I don't know this other crap around.
2700.44,2702.88," Um, probably around two or so."

2703.88,2704.88, I'm like right now.
2704.88,2707.8," So the playing games at like a friend where I'm like, well, I guess I'll"
2707.8,2711.6400000000003, leave a dog and for a little while until he's like fall asleep enough and then I
2711.6400000000003,2714.84, could go back to like finishing the guy then.
2714.84,2721.76," And I'll say even to this day and she is 14, I still will not play a super violent thing"
2721.76,2726.5600000000004, sort of around her or or my wife just I just kind of down.

2750.12,2751.12, So why don't we do it?
2751.12,2752.12, What you're playing?
2752.12,2754.12, I'm still playing Metagersawd.
2754.12,2755.12, Still like.
2755.12,2756.12, How far are you in it?
2756.12,2759.08," Like, well, that's a codex stuff because that's not a requires."
2759.08,2760.08, That's been so long.
2760.08,2761.08, So that's.
2761.08,2765.24," Yeah, I've contacted Merrill and I'm waiting for her to bust me out of some room now."
2765.3199999999997,2767.12," Oh, it's got to open up a gate for me."
2767.12,2768.12, OK.
2768.12,2769.12, So that's where I am.
2769.12,2770.52, Are you playing the Twinest Naked's version?
2770.52,2772.7599999999998," Yeah, and if had a few people on my blog say,"
2772.7599999999998,2775.04," you're playing, you're playing the wrong one."
2775.04,2778.0," Well, because I told them they blame Ryan."
2778.0,2779.7999999999997," Because it's, there's probably a good real"
2779.7999999999997,2780.6, with some for life.
2780.6,2781.4399999999996, It kind of is.
2781.4399999999996,2782.2799999999997, Yeah.
2782.2799999999997,2782.4399999999996, Yeah.
2782.4399999999996,2782.64, How is it?
2782.64,2783.4399999999996, Tell my wife.
2783.4399999999996,2784.4399999999996, Just a part of the brand.
2784.4399999999996,2785.4399999999996, Go get that like dish.
2785.4399999999996,2787.4799999999996, It's the kind of broken because of the way Twinest Naked's
2787.4799999999996,2788.0, handles things.
2788.0,2788.9599999999996, So just weird.
2788.9599999999996,2791.52," Like you said, you beat revolver, I saw a fair and square,"
2791.52,2793.64, which means you did not go into first person mode and just
2793.64,2794.0, unloaded.
2794.0,2794.64, I didn't.
2794.64,2797.3599999999997," But other people are telling me that like the cutscenes,"
2797.3599999999997,2799.56, like ruin the mood or ruin the effect.
2799.56,2801.6," Like you know that that scene with the ninja,"
2801.6,2802.56, almost all cutscenes.
2802.56,2803.4, Yes.
2803.4,2803.7599999999998, I think so.
2803.7599999999998,2805.7599999999998, The one with the ninja after you beat revolver.
2805.7599999999998,2808.04, So that's like totally like style lives.
2808.04,2810.8399999999997, Like they told that was like right after the matrix.
2810.8399999999997,2814.56," Well, I was going to take the guy who directed the cutscenes"
2814.56,2817.48, for Twinest Naked's was a guy who directed one of my favorite
2817.48,2820.16," bizarre Japanese movies called Versus, which is basically"
2820.16,2823.08, a Japanese samurai zombie movie.
2823.16,2824.48, And it's totally like this weird style.
2824.48,2826.36, I was like guys chopping zombies a half.
2826.36,2828.88, And basically the ninja cutscene was literally like one of his
2828.88,2830.72," scenes for that movie, but like with ninja,"
2830.72,2831.84, so they'll like the main character.
2831.84,2832.52, I see.
2832.52,2836.72, So do you like the hardcore faithful not like that edition?
2836.72,2838.72," Is that I mean, they say it looks different."
2838.72,2840.88, It makes it more ridiculous than it was.
2840.88,2842.16, Like I think in the new version of their original
2842.16,2842.7599999999998, ridiculous.
2842.7599999999998,2844.88, There's part of the because a game with a bag and a
2844.88,2846.04, revolver oscillate.
2846.04,2847.2, It's already ridiculous.
2847.2,2847.96, It's not ridiculous.
2847.96,2849.0, It's a very ridiculous way.
2849.0,2851.16, Had the little more like the ninja jumps in like kicks a
2851.16,2852.7999999999997, missile away and like cuts it half.
2852.7999999999997,2855.52," So you're like, okay, there's it kind of went beyond the"
2855.52,2856.16, point of life.
2856.16,2859.2," Yeah, still contend that it gets more ridiculous."
2859.2,2859.56, Yeah.
2859.56,2860.3999999999996, That was always.
2860.3999999999996,2861.0," Well, too."
2861.0,2861.3599999999997, Got more.
2861.3599999999997,2862.2," Wait, I'm talking about you."
2862.2,2863.3999999999996," Yeah, I'm talking about you."
2863.3999999999996,2865.2799999999997," Yeah, I'm just wondering if you have a weird."
2865.2799999999997,2867.92," See, in the cause of the ones, like one actually was"
2867.92,2868.7999999999997, somewhat grounded.
2868.7999999999997,2870.44," And I was like, okay, now I think that's not a ninja."
2870.44,2871.44, I fucking flip kick this.
2871.44,2872.2799999999997, So what the hell?
2872.2799999999997,2874.72," Those were my favorite things when you would do like,"
2874.72,2877.3199999999997," you know, like when we were doing the Metal Gear Solid"
2877.3199999999997,2880.3999999999996, 3 cover on OPM and you would do all the back story stuff.
2880.4,2882.28, Like just like just tracing the whole thing.
2882.28,2883.36, Because it was just so weird.
2883.36,2884.84," I mean, it's like, yeah, it's like so bad."
2884.84,2885.64, I was so weird.
2885.64,2887.64," I tried to, that's what I like about it though."
2887.64,2889.04, Is this time absurd it is?
2889.04,2890.64," Yeah, two gets played straight."
2890.64,2891.48, I wouldn't care.
2891.48,2892.08, Right.
2892.08,2892.88, Yeah.
2892.88,2895.4," Well, and so much of games out there, do you take them so"
2895.4,2896.92, so seriously and play it so straight?
2896.92,2900.52," You're like, right now for Muggy that's hyper."
2900.52,2902.88, You know what I liked and maybe this I was going to ask you if
2902.88,2904.76," this was in a, is that the title?"
2904.76,2905.76, Wow.
2905.76,2906.76, Wow.
2906.76,2907.92, One of the rejected names.
2907.92,2908.92, Yeah.
2908.92,2911.92, As a vendor rejected a game tap.
2911.92,2916.32, One of the cutscenes or maybe as part of that same long cutscene that I
2916.32,2918.08, thought was really cool.
2918.08,2921.28, Was they're talking about like the arms race or nuclear weapons or whatever.
2921.28,2923.7200000000003, And it actually goes into actual FM video.
2923.7200000000003,2924.7200000000003, Video.
2924.7200000000003,2926.12," Video like guys, Martial Satellite."
2926.12,2927.12," Oh, missiles exploded."
2927.12,2928.12," Yeah, I like that."
2928.12,2930.32," Yeah, because that was pretty big for friggin 98 at the time."
2930.32,2932.28, So was that in the original game or was that?
2932.28,2933.28," Some of us, yeah."
2933.28,2934.28, Wow.
2934.28,2935.92, That was really nice touch.
2935.92,2936.92, Yeah.
2936.92,2937.92, So there's that.
2937.92,2938.92, So I'm playing that.
2938.92,2940.36, I played battle the bands for the Wii.
2940.36,2943.8, So that's up on my reviews should be up today.
2943.8,2944.8, I want to put it.
2944.8,2945.8, I like quite a lot.
2945.8,2946.8, But I shouldn't say anything.
2946.8,2950.52, So I actually am so waiting for our review copy to show up so I can.
2950.52,2951.92, Don't you think I don't know.
2951.92,2953.32, I don't know what taint your opinion.
2953.32,2955.52," Yeah, I do do that."
2955.52,2957.16," Well, I'm playing."
2957.16,2958.16, I can't really.
2958.16,2961.16," I probably shouldn't go into detail yet, but I'm playing Wii Fit, which is why"
2961.16,2963.92," you know, as you've marked earlier, my, my weight."
2963.92,2964.92, Right.
2964.92,2966.6800000000003," At least as far as as we fit, the ledges."
2966.68,2972.68," I am near 28 years old, 5'5"", and we fit as I am 127 pounds."
2972.68,2973.68, So that's.
2973.68,2974.68, So ha ha.
2974.68,2975.68, That's okay.
2975.68,2976.68, But didn't you want to hear it?
2976.68,2979.68, I guess you're not allowed to talk about this game.
2979.68,2980.68, We can't go.
2980.68,2981.68, Probably shouldn't.
2981.68,2982.68, Yeah.
2982.68,2983.68, Ryan and I are about the same age.
2983.68,2985.68, I'm only a little bit taller here.
2985.68,2987.68, I am nowhere near 127.
2987.68,2989.68," Well, yeah, I'm only an inch taller than he is."
2989.68,2991.68," And I'm much older, but I am a girl."
2991.68,2993.68, And I am no brand new.
2993.68,2994.68, What he is.
2994.68,2995.68, Right.
2995.68,2996.68, Okay.
2996.68,2997.68," So, what?"
2997.68,2998.68, Yeah.
2998.68,2999.68, Yeah.
2999.68,3000.68, Yeah.
3000.68,3001.68, Yeah.
3001.68,3003.68, You're still eating candy.
3003.68,3004.68, I know.
3004.68,3005.68, Some day.
3005.68,3006.68," Some day, it makes."
3006.68,3007.68, What person do you eat Wii Fit?
3007.68,3009.68, Do you or skinny boy?
3009.68,3011.68, I was a skinny runt.
3011.68,3012.68, No.
3012.68,3014.68," But that's for Sarsido Real, skinny."
3014.68,3017.68," Because you and Ellie were like, keep on eating those triple cheeseburger."
3017.68,3018.68, Yeah.
3018.68,3019.68, Yeah.
3019.68,3020.68, I took me with the idea.
3020.68,3021.68, Yeah.
3021.68,3022.68, I took energy.
3022.68,3023.68, I took everything.
3023.68,3026.68," I always had a slomer to have as like, I was a fat kid."
3026.68,3027.68, Where are you?
3027.68,3028.68, And college I was huge.
3028.68,3029.68, Really?
3029.68,3030.68, Yeah.
3030.68,3031.68," See, you'd never know now."
3031.68,3032.68, I was skinny.
3032.68,3033.68, I was skinny.
3033.68,3034.68, 40.
3034.68,3035.68, Wow.
3035.68,3036.68, I was really tall.
3036.68,3037.68," I was like, no, I'm not."
3037.68,3038.68, I'm not.
3038.68,3040.68," I was just like, ah, no, I'm not."
3040.68,3041.68, I stopped.
3041.68,3043.68, I didn't know about it the wrong way.
3043.68,3044.68, Yeah.
3044.68,3045.68, Would have like some rice.
3045.68,3047.68, That was my daily meal.
3047.68,3050.68, I actually probably have a pretty good metabolism.
3050.68,3053.68, I'm not sure if you eat quite a lot.
3053.68,3060.68," Well, my coworkers comment on their amount of crappy food I eat sometimes is that I'm not bigger than I am right now."
3060.68,3062.68, I guess because I keep Jared.
3062.68,3064.68," He's like, you ordered it."
3064.68,3065.68, You actually eat the bacon.
3065.68,3067.68," Anyway, go to Wendy's on here, whatever."
3067.68,3068.68, It's like the bacon eater.
3068.68,3070.68, I just spice you bacon.
3070.68,3073.68," It's like multiple patties, bacon slices, how the bacon is really."
3073.68,3075.68, It's just told his terrell.
3075.68,3076.68, I'll have a wide do it.
3076.68,3077.68, I just hate myself.
3077.68,3078.68, It's just one of the good.
3078.68,3079.68, Yeah.
3079.68,3080.68, You don't want for the bacon.
3080.68,3081.68, You want to hear what it is?
3081.68,3082.68, You don't want for the bacon.
3082.68,3083.68, You don't want for the bacon.
3083.68,3085.68, You don't want for the bacon.
3085.68,3086.68, And you want to hear what it is.
3086.68,3090.68," Or like the Burger King one where it's like, you don't think three patties are enough?"
3090.68,3091.68, How about eight?
3091.68,3092.68, Yeah.
3092.68,3093.68, Stack it up.
3093.68,3094.68," I mean, I can't."
3094.68,3095.68," Yeah, that's so make me sick."
3095.68,3097.68," Yeah, because I, you, I use not, not anymore."
3097.68,3100.68," And I use to always get like a three by three, so they're four or four."
3100.68,3101.68," And that, not anymore."
3101.68,3102.68, It's not even on the menu.
3102.68,3103.68, That's like a special order.
3103.68,3107.68," Yeah, we have more stories about CGW people in an hour."
3107.68,3108.68, What about one of our four ways?
3108.68,3111.68," This is by, yeah, Johnny Lou, A.D."
3111.68,3112.68, What?
3112.68,3113.68, And eight by eight.
3113.68,3114.68, Eight by eight.
3114.68,3115.68," Yeah, we have a photo of it."
3115.68,3116.68, I thought it was 60 months.
3116.68,3117.68, It was in the mag.
3117.68,3118.68," No, no."
3118.68,3119.68, It was eight by eight.
3119.68,3120.68, Yeah.
3120.68,3121.68, It was very first appearance in the magazine was like that.
3121.68,3122.68, It's like this.
3122.68,3123.68," And his mouth was just like, ah."
3123.68,3125.68," Amazingly, he actually got his mouth around it."
3125.68,3129.68," Well, he's also the same person who ate a porter house for two,"
3129.68,3130.68, 84 L. or so.
3130.68,3131.68, That's true.
3131.68,3132.68, That's true.
3132.68,3133.68, That was it.
3133.68,3134.68, E3.
3134.68,3136.68, That was a tradition at CGW.
3137.68,3141.68," Oh, did I would take the CGW staff out for a steak dinner at Morton's."
3141.68,3142.68, Heck yeah.
3142.68,3144.68," No, it was eating more bucks every year."
3144.68,3146.68," Okay, I thought I was like, 84 L."
3146.68,3147.68, Oh my gosh.
3147.68,3149.68," Yeah, I think it was like 40."
3149.68,3150.68, Six pounds of steak.
3150.68,3151.68, Eight L. and six.
3151.68,3152.68, It was insane.
3152.68,3153.68, Right.
3153.68,3154.68, So what?
3154.68,3157.68," So once he already three, this whole CGW staff and assorted free"
3157.68,3161.68," Lancers if they were available, your Tom chicks and your who have used."
3161.68,3162.68, Good.
3162.68,3163.68, I'll go.
3163.68,3164.68, Got it.
3164.68,3165.68, And it was expensive.
3165.68,3168.68, It was like the only real meal we would eat.
3168.68,3170.68, It would be that it was the best.
3170.68,3171.68, Like a taste.
3171.68,3173.68," Yeah, we basically be full for a week."
3173.68,3174.68, Yeah.
3174.68,3177.68," It was usually like, was it after like most of the E3 crap."
3177.68,3180.68," Like usually like Wednesday night, I think was the traditional."
3180.68,3181.68, Or it would be a very through.
3181.68,3183.68, You would have been eating like either.
3183.68,3184.68, Right.
3184.68,3188.68, The crummy stuff of the convention center or more like things on sticks at parties.
3188.68,3189.68, Right.
3189.68,3190.68, We need on sticks.
3190.68,3191.68, Yeah.
3191.68,3193.68, So we'd have the steak dinner and Johnny Loo are.
3194.68,3197.68, Our editor who right who would eat eight by eight.
3197.68,3199.68, So I guess that was at the other end of the table.
3199.68,3203.68," But I guess at his end of the table, he was he was sort of saying like,"
3203.68,3205.68, I could eat a double porterhouse by myself.
3205.68,3208.68," And someone else said, yeah, I dare you to order it."
3208.68,3210.68, And he did.
3210.68,3215.68," Which, you know, not only was gross because this I mean,"
3215.68,3218.68, it says on it said on the menu for two.
3218.68,3219.68, Yeah.
3219.68,3223.68, But also it was like a shitload of money that I was paying for.
3223.68,3224.68," Yeah. Well,"
3224.68,3226.68," Well, Ziff was paying for it."
3226.68,3227.68, Yeah.
3227.68,3228.68, Then I fired.
3228.68,3230.68, That's why we're for the porterhouse.
3230.68,3231.68, Yeah.
3231.68,3233.68, I never forgave him.
3233.68,3234.68, Yeah.
3234.68,3235.68, Porterhouse for two.
3235.68,3236.68, Yeah.
3236.68,3238.68," Sean, what do you plan these is?"
3238.68,3240.68, DARRR.
3240.68,3241.68, I've been playing.
3241.68,3243.68, I've been catching up on seven max.
3243.68,3246.68, I came up exclusively on Game Tab.
3246.68,3247.68, I was convenient.
3248.68,3249.68, That's not anymore.
3249.68,3250.68, Is it?
3250.68,3252.68," Well, they do it on the Steam and then we have."
3252.68,3254.68, I think it's exclusive on Game Tab.
3254.68,3255.68, Yeah.
3255.68,3256.68, Yeah.
3256.68,3257.68, We get a first.
3257.68,3259.68, That's because of this season.
3259.68,3260.68, I actually decided to find it down low.
3260.68,3263.68, Because the only thing I've given play was original LucasArts.
3263.68,3265.68," I'm like, oh, I should play like this."
3265.68,3266.68," Because what there's,"
3266.68,3267.68," I would just find see there's like what like 10,"
3267.68,3268.68, 8 or 10 episodes worth of.
3268.68,3270.68, There's five in the total of that.
3270.68,3271.68, About a total 11.
3271.68,3273.68, So there's six from season one.
3273.68,3275.68, So there's 11 episodes worth of stuff.
3275.68,3276.68, That's a lot of ketchup.
3276.68,3277.68, Yeah.
3277.68,3278.68, What are they like at hour each?
3278.68,3279.68, Just like that.
3279.68,3280.68, They're like two to three.
3280.68,3281.68, Okay.
3281.68,3283.68, Free is about the PC editor.
3283.68,3284.68, So yeah.
3284.68,3287.68, The PC editor and a game that's on your site.
3287.68,3288.68, Way to be.
3288.68,3289.68, Exactly.
3289.68,3290.68, Yep.
3290.68,3291.68, Yeah.
3291.68,3293.68, I haven't done the fifth one of season two yet.
3293.68,3295.68, I just finished the fourth one target.
3295.68,3297.68, Terriots of the dogs.
3297.68,3298.68, Nice.
3298.68,3299.68, Yes.
3299.68,3304.68, We were just actually talking about the conundrum of how to keep reviewing these
3305.68,3306.68, Sam and Max.
3306.68,3307.68, This is what this is.
3307.68,3310.68, Like for this one in particular is the fourth one.
3310.68,3312.68, I have reviewed for GFW and R1 up.
3312.68,3313.68, Yeah.
3313.68,3314.68, Which means okay.
3314.68,3316.68, I've kind of just randomly done a few of them.
3316.68,3321.68, I did like number four number five from season one and like number two.
3321.68,3322.68, Season two.
3322.68,3327.68, So you have the problem of like if you go under one up like and you just want to.
3327.68,3328.68, Right.
3328.68,3330.68, Get a snapshot of the whole season like you're going to be reading other people's opinions.
3330.68,3333.68, And they might think that this one had the best puzzles.
3333.68,3334.68, Yeah.
3334.68,3335.68, So you have the problem of the funnier.
3335.68,3338.68, So like when you make statements like that is just well you know I think it put
3338.68,3341.68, them the guy who said that last episode too soon.
3341.68,3348.68, Plus they they've really do build on themselves and I think in my review which I submitted
3348.68,3354.68, to Ryan I kind of I think it's a donning and me that reviewing one of these is almost like reviewing a level of a game.
3354.68,3355.68, Yeah.
3355.68,3360.68, So if I was just reviewing like the water temple in Zelda and then putting a score on the water temple.
3360.68,3362.68, And then what would you give the water temple in Zelda?
3362.68,3364.68, Which Zelda?
3364.68,3365.68, Yeah.
3365.68,3366.68, Which one?
3366.68,3367.68, No which one.
3367.68,3369.68, I went in the in the arena time.
3369.68,3373.68, That one I would give the nate plus I think is one of the finest levels of all time despite
3373.68,3374.68, another people think.
3374.68,3376.68, Tricking water temple fanboy.
3376.68,3378.68, And he.
3378.68,3384.68, So I like times as long as like a B plus B plus yeah that's the one that involved the weights in the
3384.68,3385.68, ground.
3385.68,3389.68, Yeah and there's like all those sloping like oh yeah like slide around all that.
3389.68,3390.68, Yeah.
3390.68,3392.68, That's pretty good.
3392.68,3395.68, You're okay Jeff sorry with dying off Mike.
3395.68,3402.68, So yeah I mean this fourth one of season two is actually I think the best one that I played.
3402.68,3408.68, But again it's like in context of what it's this one especially builds so much on everything that came before I
3408.68,3411.68, It involves like time travel and you're like.
3411.68,3413.68, Visiting scenes from season one.
3413.68,3414.68, It's like lost.
3414.68,3415.68, It's very much like lost.
3415.68,3417.68, Oh it's got the I was going to find on your constant.
3417.68,3418.68, Okay.
3418.68,3420.68, I mean I'm probably going to go back to the future.
3420.68,3425.68, But yeah I involved you know jokes built on jokes built on jokes that have been accumulating for nine episodes.
3425.68,3429.68, So like as a standalone thing it's like really hard to do.
3429.68,3433.68, You can't really I mean it's a point and click adventure games so there's not really anything to talk about mechanics.
3433.68,3439.68, So it's like done with all your talking about is the plot and that's the fun part to discover.
3439.68,3440.68, And you don't want to spoil.
3440.68,3441.68, Yeah.
3441.68,3445.68, You like I could sit here and just say here's a funny puzzle and then here's a funny scene but you don't
3445.68,3446.68, want to do that.
3446.68,3456.68, Yeah I did a preview of the first episode of season two and like we actually got comments from readers saying I'm not going to read it because I don't want you to wreck anything for me.
3456.68,3457.68, Yeah and it's like.
3457.68,3461.68, Yeah maybe maybe maybe the answer is not to review every individual episode.
3461.68,3464.68, So review the season as a whole when it comes out as it's.
3464.68,3467.68, Except then but I don't know then you do see sites you know.
3467.68,3468.68, Yeah.
3468.68,3470.68, Further the reviewing episode of Lost and it's okay.
3470.68,3472.68, Yeah I find that weird.
3472.68,3473.68, I find that weird.
3473.68,3475.68, I think you're like you read it because you're into it.
3475.68,3477.68, Like you already know that like.
3477.68,3478.68, Yeah.
3478.68,3479.68, Yeah.
3479.68,3480.68, Yeah.
3480.68,3481.68, Maybe you don't read it.
3481.68,3482.68, I look on Lost PDF.
3482.68,3484.68, I don't know what to do.
3484.68,3485.68, It works.
3485.68,3488.68, I think I'm at my limit personally for reviewing these things.
3488.68,3489.68, So in the next episode.
3489.68,3490.68, I'm going to understand that.
3490.68,3491.68, Yeah.
3491.68,3492.68, I can't.
3492.68,3494.68, I can't.
3494.68,3495.68, I can't.
3495.68,3496.68, I can't.
3496.68,3497.68, Think of other ways to talk about this stuff.
3497.68,3498.68, Like I enjoy them.
3498.68,3502.68, I think they're very good games and I think they they definitely fill this void that isn't there but yeah I'm like I just I can't figure out.
3502.68,3505.68, I just I can't figure out a right about this without keep saying the same thing.
3505.68,3506.68, Really.
3506.68,3507.68, Yeah.
3507.68,3508.68, And yeah.
3508.68,3509.68, And my fourth review here.
3509.68,3514.68, I have like broken the fourth wall and just started talking about the process of reviewing these things because there's really nothing else to talk about.
3514.68,3515.68, Yeah.
3515.68,3516.68, You know.
3516.68,3517.68, You know.
3517.68,3518.68, You know.
3518.68,3521.68, You made your sweeping statements about episode of gaming already.
3521.68,3522.68, You know.
3522.68,3525.68, Just be like valve and take forever to make one.
3525.68,3526.68, Yeah.
3526.68,3527.68, Yeah.
3527.68,3528.68, I mean those are different.
3528.68,3529.68, I mean.
3529.68,3530.68, It is pretty good.
3530.68,3537.68, It's something that's really truly has found you know followed through and a big way on this like the only ones who have really.
3537.68,3538.68," No, it's the total success."
3538.68,3539.68, The total success.
3539.68,3541.68, I was playing for the pick up boat again.
3541.68,3542.68, Boen.
3542.68,3543.68, Yeah.
3543.68,3545.68, That's the guy that's that's strong that game.
3545.68,3547.68, I know they're doing the doing strong.
3547.68,3548.68, For the way where.
3548.68,3549.68, Oh yeah.
3549.68,3551.68, And it's coming.
3551.68,3552.68, It's coming.
3552.68,3553.68, I think it's we were first.
3553.68,3554.68, Yeah.
3554.68,3555.68, But did bound just die.
3555.68,3556.68, I think so.
3556.68,3560.64," Well, I heard I read some room and I've both was like kind of in limbo because of the"
3560.64,3561.64, flight to movie.
3561.64,3564.64, Like that there I guess are waiting for like this.
3564.64,3565.64, Activation.
3565.64,3567.64, Animation a start of something like this.
3567.64,3569.64, They're supposed to be it got off your wall.
3569.64,3570.64, I'm going to.
3570.64,3574.64," It's supposed to be some kind of movement that once that movement was started, then they'll pick up on the game again."
3574.64,3575.64, There's like that.
3575.64,3577.64, What am I on the other side of the comics?
3577.64,3579.64, People always ask us for comic recommendations.
3579.64,3580.64, Bound would be one.
3580.64,3581.64, That's.
3581.64,3582.64, That's.
3582.64,3583.64, I like the big like one point version.
3583.64,3584.64, Yeah.
3584.64,3585.64, Very sense paper.
3585.64,3586.64, Yeah.
3586.64,3588.64, It's very thin papers of commit.
3588.64,3589.64, Yeah.
3589.64,3590.64, Yeah.
3590.64,3592.64, Great story that holds up all the way through.
3592.64,3594.64, Are there comic recommendations?
3594.64,3595.64, That's.
3595.64,3596.64, That's what you're going on.
3596.64,3597.64, I think I think about what I was playing.
3597.64,3598.64, Yeah.
3598.64,3599.64," Oh, we're going."
3599.64,3600.64, You weren't actually looking to.
3600.64,3601.64, I know.
3601.64,3603.64," Oh, you play in Dana."
3603.64,3610.64," Well, I've just finished reviewing the wee version of a comic, which I was a very big fan of that game on PS2."
3610.64,3611.64," Yeah, remember."
3611.64,3612.64, Like it on Wii as well.
3612.64,3614.64, Although the graphics are not.
3614.64,3615.64," Well, okay."
3615.64,3617.64, Here's the big pro and the big con with the game.
3617.64,3618.64, The big con with the other one.
3618.64,3621.64, So it depends on what bugs you the most.
3621.64,3624.64, The wee version does not look as good graphically.
3624.64,3625.64, Okay.
3625.64,3626.64," However, the PS2."
3626.64,3628.64," There's a lot of really, really long."
3628.64,3629.64, Yeah.
3629.64,3633.64," A lot of really, and I ran them on the exact same TV side by side."
3633.64,3635.64, So like it wasn't just the objective.
3635.64,3638.64, Like I used John's big guest TV and mine.
3638.64,3639.64, Yeah.
3639.64,3640.64, PS2 version looks better.
3640.64,3644.64," However, the PS2 version has lengthy cut scenes that you cannot skip."
3644.64,3645.64, And the version.
3646.64,3647.64, You can skip.
3647.64,3648.64, Okay.
3648.64,3649.64, And you can speed up dialogue.
3649.64,3650.64," Oh, okay."
3650.64,3651.64, So I have the PS2 version.
3651.64,3653.64, I have started the PS2 version.
3653.64,3655.64, I'm not finished with the PS2 version.
3655.64,3656.64, The wee one.
3656.64,3658.64, I kind of stopped when I heard about the wee one.
3658.64,3660.64," And like, okay, I'm not going to play as we're going to the wee one."
3660.64,3663.64, Worth it for someone who has already has the PS2 version.
3663.64,3664.64, How far are we?
3664.64,3665.64, Not very.
3665.64,3667.64, And I would probably start over anyway if I were to pick up the PS2 one again.
3667.64,3670.64, Even though there is that game in a cut scene at the beginning.
3670.64,3671.64, Right.
3671.64,3672.64," Well, you can skip past that with the wee version."
3672.64,3673.64, Okay.
3673.64,3678.64, I think it's a little bit longer to get used to just because like with the PS2
3678.64,3680.64, since you're using the analog stick.
3680.64,3682.64, Like you have this automatic guide.
3682.64,3683.64," You know, a limit."
3683.64,3686.64, And like you're with the wee you're completely free form.
3686.64,3689.64," So, you know, it's like much easier to screw stuff up."
3689.64,3691.64, It took a little longer to get used to it.
3691.64,3693.64, Which one when I play it on.
3693.64,3694.64, I don't know.
3694.64,3699.64," You know, I would do we just because I can't stand really long cut scenes."
3699.64,3702.64, And I hate dialogue that like a fast reader.
3702.64,3706.64," And so when the dialogue is just trickling across and I can't speed it up, it drives me nuts."
3706.64,3709.64, So I would do the wee version just because I'm very impatient.
3709.64,3710.64, Okay.
3710.64,3717.64," I think that game also, if I remember at the beginning at least has a lot of dialogue that exist that is just dot dot dot dot for a match."
3717.64,3718.64, Yeah.
3718.64,3720.64, There's really dot dot dot dot dot.
3720.64,3721.64, Yeah.
3721.64,3722.64," Well, you made me read that."
3722.64,3723.64," Oh, Google."
3723.64,3724.64, That's what have you watched.
3724.64,3725.64, Yeah.
3725.64,3727.64, I gave it a nine in OPM on the PS2 version.
3727.64,3730.64, And I also gave the wee version a nine on games app.
3730.64,3731.64, So yeah.
3731.64,3732.64, What else.
3732.64,3733.64, I'm still.
3733.64,3741.64," I'm still slugging through puzzle quest on my DS just because, you know, I like matching three things together."
3741.64,3743.64, And a role playing in my room.
3743.64,3745.64, But Ryan says they're a role playing game.
3745.64,3748.64," Well, it is, it is that too, but I, you know."
3748.64,3749.64, I heard this.
3749.64,3750.64, It's a bit short.
3750.64,3751.64, Let's on melt.
3751.64,3752.64, Yeah.
3752.64,3753.64, Yeah.
3753.64,3754.64, Yeah.
3754.64,3757.64, The amount as fact is kind of useless.
3758.64,3759.64, Yeah.
3759.64,3760.64, Yeah.
3760.64,3761.64, Yeah.
3761.64,3762.64, Yeah.
3762.64,3763.64, That's a best way.
3763.64,3765.64," It's a, it's a jewel but you get mountain it."
3765.64,3766.64, Like what?
3766.64,3768.64," I mean, it's definitely drags."
3768.64,3772.64," But you know, I've been like kind of coming, leaving it and coming back to it."
3772.64,3775.64, And it's just something that doesn't require a lot of thought.
3775.64,3777.64, So that puzzle questions.
3777.64,3778.64, Awesome.
3778.64,3779.64," I mean, I like it."
3779.64,3780.64, No.
3780.64,3781.64, I know.
3781.64,3782.64, I don't like actually the look of the sequel.
3782.64,3783.64, Have you seen it?
3783.64,3785.64, I'm going to go like this.
3785.64,3790.64," And it whichever way you drag the gem, that's the way that the gem's fall."
3790.64,3793.64," Like if you're in space, because it's like you're in space."
3793.64,3795.64, It's a very effective inertia.
3795.64,3799.64, So it's like being paying attention to which way you're dragging the gem to.
3799.64,3801.64, Is that a little effect the board?
3801.64,3802.64," Oh, I may have just over complicated."
3802.64,3803.64, I know.
3803.64,3804.64," I'm like, let's get it."
3804.64,3806.64, You don't fight with success.
3806.64,3807.64, Yeah.
3807.64,3809.64, But jewel day to do anything wacky.
3809.64,3810.64, No.
3810.64,3811.64, No.
3811.64,3814.64, It went to 73D graphics.
3815.64,3816.64, All right.
3816.64,3819.64," Those gems were like popping out of my, uh, popping out of my screen."
3819.64,3824.64," We joke that if GFW magazine had continued, we are going to do a bajoon three cover."
3824.64,3825.64, Hell yeah.
3825.64,3828.64," At least at the very least, um, peggle two."
3828.64,3829.64, Peggle nights.
3829.64,3830.64," Oh, pebble two, pebble nights."
3830.64,3831.64, It's great.
3831.64,3832.64, When the real sequel opens up.
3832.64,3833.64, Yeah.
3833.64,3834.64, Yeah.
3834.64,3835.64, We could have just put that chipmunk on the cover.
3835.64,3836.64, Maybe the unicorn.
3836.64,3837.64, He's back.
3837.64,3838.64, Bjorn.
3838.64,3839.64, The chipmunk.
3839.64,3840.64, Bjorn.
3840.64,3841.64, The evil chipmunk.
3841.64,3842.64," Oh, not the chipmunk."
3842.64,3843.64," Oh, yeah."
3843.64,3844.64," Oh, god."
3844.64,3846.64, That's Dana's favorite.
3846.64,3847.64, Yeah.
3847.64,3849.64," You know, Ryan will randomly just aim me that link."
3849.64,3852.64," Like out of the blue every, every month or so."
3852.64,3853.64, Just to just to try to read.
3853.64,3858.64, You just have to watch me the one person in this geek community who has never laughed at that.
3858.64,3859.64, No.
3859.64,3860.64, You've never laughed at this world.
3860.64,3861.64," Oh, that's funny."
3861.64,3862.64, I'm sorry.
3862.64,3863.64, It's just playing.
3863.64,3864.64, It's not funny.
3864.64,3865.64, Yeah.
3865.64,3866.64, Yeah.
3866.64,3867.64, I do.
3867.64,3868.64, It's not funny.
3868.64,3869.64, It's not funny.
3869.64,3870.64, Yeah.
3870.64,3871.64, I do.
3871.64,3872.64, It's not funny.
3872.64,3876.64," But I'm just like, the other stuff, the energy thing that the energy."
3876.64,3877.64, I play anything else.
3877.64,3879.64, You're playing anything on the PC.
3879.64,3880.64, Remember that.
3880.64,3881.64, C-T-W.
3881.64,3884.64, I haven't had anyone to fund in my upgrade of a PC.
3884.64,3886.64, So other than wow on my MacBook.
3886.64,3887.64, No.
3887.64,3888.64, And I haven't played.
3888.64,3889.64, Wow.
3889.64,3890.64, And a long time either.
3890.64,3891.64, I want to get back.
3891.64,3892.64, I could get back into that.
3892.64,3893.64, Yeah.
3893.64,3894.64, We were talking about that today.
3894.64,3897.64, Kill in time at work because we're both like at this kind of profile.
3897.64,3900.64," Well, I mean, I have previous that I need to write, but they're not due to"
3900.64,3903.0," So, you know, have a different crafts tonight."

3903.72,3905.24, And yeah.
3905.24,3906.92," Just kidding me on the proud Morris, everybody."
3906.92,3908.56," Here's the thing, like, I hate the hell."
3908.56,3910.72, I hate pick a groups in general.
3910.72,3911.68," So every time I read,"
3911.68,3913.48," every time I get here, I'm like, the mid 40s,"
3913.48,3916.08," whereas like, you really, it really helps to have like groups"
3916.08,3916.92, that instantly like scale.
3916.92,3918.64," You're gonna have to say, you know, doing,"
3918.64,3920.0," I just hate like arm league,"

3928.44,3930.84," these three of those, and where is, well, yeah."
3930.84,3933.68," I mean, these can tolerate and cut down a little bit."
3933.68,3934.52, Wow.

3935.68,3936.7200000000003," you're a real, funny roll."
3936.7200000000003,3937.52," I'll do a problem with her,"
3937.52,3939.48," they're just like, say, like, I'll at least look for someone."
3939.48,3942.68, That game is so different when you're playing with people.
3942.68,3945.04," When you have five friends in an instance,"
3945.04,3947.96, I still say it is like the best game.
3947.96,3948.96," Yeah, one, one."
3948.96,3950.84," When I was so, as if we had to club sandwiched"
3950.84,3952.4," guilt, that was like the best I had."
3952.4,3953.76," Wow, because like me, it's good."
3953.76,3955.36," Yeah, I lived club sandwiched."
3955.36,3956.52," Right, right through stupid dungeon."
3956.52,3958.7599999999998, I was just like sitting on a server there.
3958.7599999999998,3960.08," Yeah, so I was going to play."
3960.08,3961.56, I still have Neemon Ranch.

3962.56,3964.56," I, my tour more year."
3964.56,3965.56, Yeah.

3968.08,3970.32," I always used to call him in, but that's a name Niamon."
3970.32,3971.7599999999998, I was a name in also.
3971.7599999999998,3973.16, It's like Neemon.

3977.16,3978.48," Yeah, me as a skipper,"
3978.48,3979.56," saying, I was going to call a girl,"
3979.56,3981.24," and like, just kind of club sandwiched."
3981.24,3983.56, Cause it's like the first one I've got before one
3983.56,3984.56, up before.
3984.56,3985.56, I can't.
3985.56,3986.56, I joined Kenquit.
3986.56,3988.32," You briefly, by just didn't play enough to like really"
3988.32,3989.7999999999997, be part of the Kenquit you called.
3989.7999999999997,3990.7999999999997," Yeah, I have a Kenquit."
3990.7999999999997,3992.6, I can't quit you and it's been so long.
3992.6,3993.12, You did.
3993.12,3994.12," That's still, you can exist."
3994.12,3994.48, You.
3994.48,3995.48, Yep.
3995.48,3996.7999999999997, That was the counterpart to vomit.
3996.7999999999997,3999.12, They kind of become their own thing without any of.
3999.12,4000.12, I think anyone.
4000.12,4001.92, Ustiller in it.
4001.92,4003.92," Yes, except any any."
4003.92,4005.32, Any Kenquitters.
4005.32,4008.04, Can't quit youers who are listening now know that I have not
4008.04,4009.64, locked in in about six weeks.
4009.64,4011.0, The flu derailed me from.
4011.0,4012.0, Wow.
4012.0,4012.72, So vomit.
4012.72,4015.2," Did you, did you with Sherrit over there to Sherrit?"
4015.2,4016.2," No, Eggbird is."
4016.2,4017.2, Eggbird.
4017.2,4018.2," I mean, I was right."
4018.2,4019.2," Oh, Sherbert was, oh, that was another bird."
4019.2,4020.2," Yeah, Sherbert."
4020.2,4023.2, I actually wonder if my known name Petto is still on.
4023.2,4024.2, Petto.
4024.2,4025.2, I think that's common.
4025.2,4028.6, I found like this gross looking face and facial recognition that makes
4028.6,4030.2, all of these constant learing up things.
4030.2,4032.2, I just named it that and see what can get with it.
4032.2,4034.64," I actually, how do I slash follow all at the kids running around"
4034.64,4036.2, store when and like people.
4036.2,4037.2, Yeah.
4037.2,4038.2, That's great.
4038.2,4039.2, Wow.
4039.2,4041.2," But don't you, I was just saying you're a dad."
4041.2,4042.2," Well, I just wait to see you."
4042.2,4043.2, They change it.
4043.2,4044.2," Actually, I can't actually remind you."
4044.2,4045.2, I can't actually see.
4045.2,4046.2, Where are you?
4046.2,4047.2, It's pretty dark.
4047.2,4048.2, That's real nice.
4048.2,4052.2," Where are you playing wow on like your, your wedding day or something?"
4052.2,4054.2," Oh, yeah."
4054.2,4056.2," Yeah, we thought it was very club sandwiched."
4056.2,4057.2," No, no."
4057.2,4058.2, What?
4058.2,4059.2, What is on Saturday?
4059.2,4062.2, I leave Sunday like after was actually evening.
4062.2,4066.2," So yes, Sunday morning, while I was packing, I had to spare time."
4066.2,4067.2, I played so well.
4067.2,4070.2, And then we left for Mexico because we like to see that.
4070.2,4071.2, It's a club sandwiched.
4071.2,4072.2, Yeah.
4072.2,4073.2, Yeah.
4073.2,4075.2, And we had been at his wedding.
4075.2,4076.2, Right.
4076.2,4077.2, I think skip.
4077.2,4079.2, Actually set the guild message that said scooter.
4079.2,4080.2, Get the hell off.
4080.2,4083.2, The computer and enjoy your honeymoon.
4083.2,4088.2," But the big thing I got me out while was like, yeah, having a lot of those, like, I"
4088.2,4089.2, just couldn't sleep on.
4089.2,4090.2," I was like, I would play."
4090.2,4095.2," Oh, wait, God go and like being a middle, like running, you know, armory and be like,"
4095.2,4096.2," Oh, God go in it."
4096.2,4097.2," Oh, wait."
4097.2,4099.2," I got trained by all these like, you know, mobs and stuff like that."
4099.2,4101.2, So I just stopped playing and I just haven't really picked up since.
4101.2,4104.2, But it's quite a nuisance that way.
4104.2,4106.2, Now I think I could follow get back into it.
4106.2,4107.2, I'm waiting for it.
4107.2,4112.2," Actually, when we go see Litch King a few of us are going to go in a couple weeks for a press event."
4112.2,4117.2, And I think that these press events always sort of reignite my.
4117.2,4118.2, I think you were right.
4118.2,4123.2," I say, yeah, like because of like the way like some other, well, like Brad Schumacher for one of the games,"
4123.2,4124.2, but I was talking about it.
4124.2,4125.2, I was actually still talking about it.
4125.2,4127.2, And because it's not game spot anymore.
4127.2,4128.2, That's why I said for me.
4128.2,4130.2," Oh, formerly I didn't have the formerly."
4130.2,4132.2, And that was crunching on my can.
4132.2,4133.2, Yeah.
4133.2,4136.2," And because of the Donna Ward 2 now, I've been playing both like a lot of Donna"
4136.2,4141.2," War and come to hear what's lately trying to like say, all right, if I combine these two experts into one,"
4141.2,4143.2," that's like, like, Donna Ward 2 is going to be like,"
4143.2,4144.2," like, the future."
4144.2,4147.2," That's, that's, that's just what I do like desk."
4147.2,4151.2," That are like, lose terribly a TF 2 like, oh, my slave bro,"
4151.2,4154.2, try to hit you in close range for a knife to sell using my rifle.
4154.2,4155.2, Oops.
4155.2,4157.2," I've been thinking about getting back into them, but that's kind of a TF 2."
4157.2,4158.2, Yeah.
4158.2,4159.2," Yeah, but it's here."
4159.2,4161.2," Well, I'll be announcement with all the."
4161.2,4163.2, That's what got me back to stuff.
4163.2,4164.2, That's what got me back to that.
4164.2,4167.2," Actually, it's because I went to the Valley of Mount War and played gold rush."
4167.2,4169.2," And I was like, oh, the credits are great map."
4169.2,4172.2," I really get back to TF 2 and, oh, wow, I forgot I suck at this game."
4172.2,4176.2," Yeah, I'm afraid that I will just be so left in the dust by the time I log in again."
4176.2,4179.2," Yeah, it's still not quite as bad as like counter strike though."
4179.2,4183.2," Yeah, I'm still smiling off that you go and you can serve."
4183.2,4185.2," And there are classes that like, you know,"
4185.2,4188.2, exist kind of outside of the super classes.
4188.2,4190.2, I'm just too old to like online games.
4190.2,4194.2," I'm just like, are you young people who have time to sit on here?"
4194.2,4196.2," The kids, oh, the internet kids."
4196.2,4198.2, Mostly the people.
4198.2,4199.2, Yeah.
4199.2,4200.2, Right.
4200.2,4204.2," I like, I like MMOs other than all the other humans who are lying in there."
4204.2,4206.2, You need people who like.
4206.2,4207.2, Yeah.
4207.2,4208.2, Exactly.
4208.2,4211.2, I would not be playing well if all I was doing is pick up groups or like that.
4211.2,4214.2, That's what you do get to the point like what's like school is.
4214.2,4215.2," I was saying, where are you in your 40s?"
4215.2,4217.2, Where you really have no choice but to group.
4217.2,4219.2," And like, hey, you all that's that."
4219.2,4221.2," We're like, make it all in roles somewhere and start again."
4221.2,4222.2, I get 40s.
4222.2,4224.2," I'm like, you know what screw is that?"
4224.2,4228.2, You can you can get your internet instance except for like the first.
4228.2,4229.2, The RMR one.
4229.2,4231.2, You have two point three changes.
4231.2,4232.2, I think it was two point.
4232.2,4234.2, Whenever they did the level in two.
4234.2,4237.2," Yeah, you can solo the whole thing so easily because they got rid of a lot of"
4237.2,4238.2, questions that were elite.
4238.2,4239.2, They made them.
4239.2,4240.2, They saw.
4240.2,4241.2, Can you still do it?
4241.2,4243.2, Can you still always just six at least?
4243.2,4244.2, You think?
4244.2,4245.2," Yeah, usually."
4245.2,4246.2, You're not.
4246.2,4248.2," So, the benefit of having someone else in your house who will play."
4248.2,4249.2," Well, yes."
4249.2,4250.2, Yeah.
4250.2,4251.2," See, I like it."
4251.2,4252.2, Constant team.
4252.2,4256.2, I live with a cheap skate who just would not want to pay for two accounts.
4256.2,4257.2, Ah.
4257.2,4259.2," I mean, I think he would like it."
4259.2,4262.2," And he's looked at it and he was like, oh, yeah, that looks like it would be fun."
4262.2,4263.2, But I am not.
4263.2,4264.2," Because he is kind of a gamer, right?"
4264.2,4266.2," Well, he's weird because he's like way behind."
4266.2,4269.2," It's funny because he works like in an office with people who like,"
4269.2,4273.2, there was this guy who just got a PS3 and thinks it's fascinating that I work in the end.
4273.2,4277.2," You know, he's just like always asking Brian about these games and Brian's like, I don't know."
4277.2,4279.2, And I'll bring stuff home for Brian all the time.
4279.2,4281.2, And then he won't look at it for like a year or two years.
4281.2,4287.2, Like he totally jumped on the Marlond bandwagon or oblivion bandwagon.
4287.2,4288.2, It's a Marlond.
4288.2,4289.2," Yeah, it's a game."
4289.2,4291.2," The little bandwagon, like a year after I brought home."
4291.2,4293.2," I was like, this game's awesome."
4293.2,4295.2, And he was playing it nonstop.
4295.2,4297.2," But it's like, yeah, I probably asked him."
4297.2,4299.2, I talked him in the thousandth of the games.
4299.2,4300.2, Yeah.
4301.2,4303.2, The last game I talked him about was Bard's Tale.
4303.2,4306.2," Oh, when they did the original, when they did the original,"
4306.2,4308.2," when they did the original, when they did the original."
4308.2,4309.2, The original.
4309.2,4310.2," Oh, the original."
4310.2,4311.2, Yeah. Okay.
4311.2,4314.2," Well, the PC because the PC version like had the first three on it."
4314.2,4316.2, And those were like he played those when he was growing up.
4316.2,4319.2," And it was just like, he still took the clip."
4319.2,4320.2," Oh, awesome."
4320.2,4323.2," So he like installed the first one and was like, like,"
4323.2,4324.2, just like brought it up to show me.
4324.2,4328.2," And then he was like, oh, he was like, no, but two like the graphics were so much better."
4328.2,4330.2, And then we went back and tried some new games.
4330.2,4331.2, He was very disappointed.
4331.2,4335.2, Like every time that he would bring up these games that had the best graphics ever.
4335.2,4336.2, And then we all go through that.
4336.2,4337.2, It didn't so much.
4337.2,4338.2, Yeah.
4338.2,4339.2, You don't like what I liked.
4339.2,4340.2, Yeah.
4340.2,4341.2, Yeah.
4341.2,4342.2, I was just going in that with fallout.
4342.2,4344.2, I remember how great these looked to me.
4344.2,4345.2, And they look pretty.
4345.2,4346.2, Yeah.
4346.2,4347.2, Crabby now.
4347.2,4348.2, Yeah.
4348.2,4349.2," Little, little, I see metric dudes running around."
4349.2,4350.2, Watching rats and the growing.
4350.2,4351.2, Yeah.
4351.2,4353.2, Gameplay is some of my time when it's graphics.
4353.2,4354.2, Yeah.
4354.2,4355.2, Yeah.
4355.2,4356.2, Yeah.
4356.2,4357.2, I think that's the day of sex one.
4357.2,4358.2," Oh, man."
4358.2,4361.2," He said, like, right now, it's a technology back versus back."
4361.2,4364.2," Then it's like, you got to really love that game."
4364.2,4368.2, And some ways it's even worse with those like early generation 3D games.
4368.2,4369.2, I'm sorry.
4369.2,4370.2, Yeah.
4370.2,4371.2, I see for the heck of it.
4371.2,4374.2," Actually, I was actually loaded up 2 and 3 just to see what it looks like."
4374.2,4375.2, Just see what it looks like.
4375.2,4376.2," Like now it's like, oh, yeah."
4376.2,4378.2," Monster clauses still, but it is fun to see."
4378.2,4379.2, Like running on like a super.
4379.2,4382.2," A monster system, which is much faster when they had back then."
4382.2,4383.2," Like, do me three really smoothly."
4383.2,4385.2, And you have to straight up monster closet.
4385.2,4386.2, Yeah.
4386.2,4388.2," So, you know, you know, models are even the characters are quite details."
4388.2,4392.2," Now these are, but did general look like, yeah, it is still overall like lots of hallways"
4392.2,4393.2, textures and stuff.
4393.2,4395.2, And there'll be a bald guy where even though he's bald has no hair.
4395.2,4398.2," He still has weird points on his head because, you know, I mean, the polys"
4398.2,4403.2," like make his head round, but still that's he actually still kind of holds up much better"
4403.2,4406.2, than like other games like day sex.
4406.2,4409.2, Other games like doing three not that old.
4409.2,4411.2," Well, there's certain games like like play."
4412.2,4414.2," Yeah, well, they're certain games like like play."
4414.2,4415.2, Do you know the wind waker?
4415.2,4416.2, Yeah.
4416.2,4417.2, That totally still.
4417.2,4418.2," Well, yeah, that's that right."
4418.2,4419.2, They kind of the transcendent.
4419.2,4421.2, That's because it's so.
4421.2,4422.2, Knowledge.
4422.2,4423.2," Yeah, so this art style."
4423.2,4424.2," Yeah, that's what it's all about."
4424.2,4426.2, You're trying to shoot for the realism bar.
4426.2,4428.2, And that's where that's where that's where I like falling victim to.
4428.2,4429.2, It's for the time.
4429.2,4431.2, But the time is not your friend at all.
4431.2,4432.2, Right.
4432.2,4436.2," Well, that's where something like why something like wow is so smart or TF2."
4436.2,4437.2, Yeah.
4437.2,4438.2, Right.
4438.2,4439.2," I mean, that's still going to look good."
4439.2,4440.2, I'm sure.
4440.2,4441.2, It's the art engineer's personality.
4441.2,4442.2, Right.
4442.2,4443.2, Right.
4443.2,4446.2, So even though it don't like even the记ps of Skelling is as funny as
4446.2,4448.2, it was just an animation archery.
4448.2,4449.2, Just keeps it backed.
4449.2,4450.2," Yeah, using yeah."
4450.2,4455.2," When I reinstalled every quest one would not that long ago, relatively, like within the last year,"
4455.2,4457.2," oh my god, yeah."
4457.2,4459.2, But once even with like updated graphics.
4459.2,4460.2, Yes.
4460.2,4461.2, But the updated graphics.
4461.2,4465.2, But what what I remember was at that time when I was really hooked into it.
4465.2,4468.2, Like it was such a realistic world I was inhabiting.
4468.2,4469.2, I thought you know and now it's on.
4469.2,4470.76," You know, and now I look at it."
4470.76,4473.0, I think your imagination was a little sharper.
4473.0,4474.599999999999, That was required.
4474.599999999999,4475.96, Right.
4475.96,4476.92, Even done the warrior.
4476.92,4478.96," Only an O4, a man that game was looking."
4478.96,4480.36," Oh, this is it got."
4480.36,4483.96," You know, your orgs look all like these Lerler triangular jaws because they like,"
4483.96,4485.72," oh, you can't have qualities I have like a square jaw."
4485.72,4486.88, You got to be a triangular jaw.
4486.88,4489.44, Your space manager like these words squat.
4489.44,4491.44," Dude, they look fat, not like that."
4491.44,4492.44," Yeah, that's."
4492.44,4493.599999999999," Yeah, Starcraft II."
4493.599999999999,4494.76, I've been having that trouble with.
4494.76,4496.2, And the fact that you can't zoom.
4496.2,4497.2, Starcraft II.
4497.2,4498.2, Starcraft II.
4498.2,4500.5599999999995, I'm so done with Starcraft II.
4500.5599999999995,4502.44, I'm on three now.
4502.44,4503.44, Yeah.
4503.44,4504.44," All you wait for, too."
4504.44,4505.44," No, Starcraft II."
4505.44,4507.639999999999, One very old looking.
4507.639999999999,4510.28, But boy does that gameplay hold it.
4510.28,4511.48, Yeah.
4511.48,4512.8," Boy, howdy does it."
4512.8,4514.5199999999995, You mean.
4514.5199999999995,4520.24," Uh, so I'll mention one of the game I just blogged about that I want to alert listeners"
4520.24,4521.32, who if they haven't.
4521.32,4523.16," Yeah, uh, track mania."
4523.16,4525.44, Think this is track mania nations forever.
4525.44,4526.96, Celebrating United Forever.
4527.04,4529.2, Trivine all drives if I got the nation's.
4529.2,4530.6," You know, the forever extreme."
4530.6,4531.4800000000005," Well, they'll call it that."
4531.4800000000005,4532.0, Right.
4532.0,4536.72," The new one on the new track mania, which you can get on steam or I think you could just go"
4536.72,4538.2, to actually track mania.com.
4538.2,4541.96, This is a very popular arcade racing franchise.
4541.96,4547.0," It's been more popular in Europe than in here, but it has quite a big following."
4547.0,4551.84, It always has both for it's arcade racing and it's track building.
4551.84,4553.8," Um, so that's arcade racing."
4553.8,4554.8, Right.
4554.8,4555.92, It's not like you have to worry about gear ratios and all that.
4556.0,4557.68, It is a total arcade racer.
4557.68,4560.12," It, it primarily uses the keyboard."
4560.12,4563.24, That's what it defaults to not even the mouse.
4563.24,4568.24," Um, I guess you could plug in a game game pad, but I read on one form that the developers"
4568.24,4569.52, themselves just use the keyboard.
4569.52,4570.4, That's what I've been playing with.
4570.4,4576.32," So requires no, no sort of knowledge of how, you know, cars or engines work or how."
4576.32,4577.96, Or physics or physics.
4577.96,4582.2," I mean, it does help to know how to like, you know, go through the red packs of a turn"
4582.2,4583.2, and that kind of stuff.
4583.2,4584.92," I mean, those skills will help you a little bit."
4584.92,4589.56," But really when you're talking about using the arrow keys, you're not talking about"
4589.56,4590.84, a whole lot of finesse.
4590.84,4591.84, Yeah.
4591.84,4596.76," So, uh, but this entire game is online for free right now."
4596.76,4599.88, And it's really great.
4599.88,4604.68," And for free, it's probably like the best download I've done in forever."
4604.68,4607.24, There is a lot that you can do for free.
4607.24,4610.28, There's all different levels of difficulty.
4610.84,4618.16," Level has maybe 20, 20 races that unlock as you go on and beat them."
4618.16,4621.36," Most of them are incredibly short, you know, a minute or two."
4621.36,4625.2, And sometimes they're like 12 seconds because the whole thing is just basically like a
4625.2,4626.2, stunt.
4626.2,4628.639999999999," And you have to, you know, jump through whatever hoops."
4628.639999999999,4633.04, The graphics are are really quite brilliant.
4633.04,4638.599999999999," They're their cartoony and it's 3D, but they've got a good sort of arcade cartoon shine"
4638.599999999999,4639.599999999999, to them.
4639.68,4643.88," I think they get more if you pay, like are there more features that I believe I don't"
4643.88,4647.8," I don't want to miss because I didn't spend enough time on site, but I believe that"
4647.8,4649.76, there is stuff that you can pay for.
4649.76,4654.0, I believe that some of the online competition is something that you pay for.
4654.0,4655.96, I might be wrong and I apologize.
4655.96,4659.0, They also did release a pay version.
4659.0,4661.0, There's like a 40 dollar game on Steam as well.
4661.0,4668.64," But just to, uh, even the taste that they provide in free game is so there's so much"
4668.68,4672.88," there, you know, there's so much to do that it'll keep you busy for a long time."
4672.88,4679.08," So if you ever wondered about Trackmania or if you just want a cool free arcade racer,"
4679.08,4680.280000000001, I highly recommend it.
4680.280000000001,4681.280000000001, Intriguing.
4681.280000000001,4682.240000000001, It's good shit.
4682.240000000001,4683.280000000001, Trackmania.
4683.280000000001,4686.4800000000005, Let's my tip of the week.
4686.4800000000005,4687.88, Brought to you by.
4687.88,4692.92, I was wondering how long they'll look when they're trying to make it.
4692.92,4695.4400000000005, Brought to you by your key bars.
4695.4400000000005,4696.92, It's not for girls.
4697.84,4700.04, We in pro tip.
4700.04,4702.4800000000005, All right.
4702.4800000000005,4703.72, Asked.
4703.72,4705.72, Gooder.
4705.72,4711.8," At work, I just a bit down time and playing either TF2 or company heroes."
4711.8,4714.16," At home, I play a lot rock band."
4714.16,4715.16," Rock, yes."
4715.16,4718.84, Boston is the best downloadable content in any game ever.
4718.84,4719.84, The Boston Mega Pack.
4719.84,4720.84, Boston Pack is good.
4720.84,4721.84, More to the field.
4721.84,4726.2," I guess now, literally the greatest single experience in gaming history have done it a long"
4726.2,4727.2, time until I'm.
4727.2,4728.8, What's your daughter can participate?
4728.8,4731.44, Does Boston need a mega pack or do you know what just need?
4731.44,4732.44, Just.
4732.44,4733.76, Is it really just more than you're doing?
4733.76,4735.76, More than if it's like that wasn't guitar hero.
4735.76,4736.76, Two.
4736.76,4737.76, One.
4737.76,4738.76," Well, the guitar hero won."
4738.76,4740.44," And that basically when Rock and I feel like I've more to feel like I'm like,"
4740.44,4743.04," okay, I really don't need my cover guitar hero one anymore."
4743.04,4745.5199999999995, There's no reason for me to ever put it in my PS2.
4745.5199999999995,4746.76, That one is really fun to play.
4746.76,4749.5199999999995," But see, I've either the Boston Mega Pack as like boarded filling with some pretty cool"
4749.5199999999995,4750.5199999999995, bonuses on top of it.
4750.5199999999995,4753.5599999999995," Yeah, if you only, if you really are a Stigio, you're a Microsoft points, you're a"
4753.56,4757.6," PlayStation that worked dollars, whatever, get more than feeling only or just bring"
4757.6,4759.080000000001, for the whole thing.
4759.080000000001,4760.080000000001, My favorite deals.
4760.080000000001,4762.320000000001, What other fantastic tunes do you never mind?
4762.320000000001,4768.120000000001," It's basically, it's a first, it's the first Boston EP pretty much except for one song"
4768.120000000001,4770.4400000000005, because I guess it's a lot of life because it was free.
4770.4400000000005,4771.4400000000005, There you go.
4771.4400000000005,4772.4400000000005, Yep.
4772.4400000000005,4773.4400000000005, Okay.
4773.4400000000005,4774.4400000000005, Portal one.
4774.4400000000005,4776.6," So when you're playing Rock, being what instrument are you playing?"
4776.6,4779.120000000001," I've been most, I play everything except singing."
4779.12,4782.8, My wife does singing and my kid does singing and drums kind of.
4782.8,4784.08, That's pretty cute.
4784.08,4785.08, She grabs the mic.
4785.08,4789.12," Oh, that sounds like, how the fuck the game went easy, like, bail her out."
4789.12,4791.12," But the times, hopefully, hope is a short song."
4791.12,4794.12, So we were like completely failed when she's actually playing.
4794.12,4798.16, We were actually at a wedding this weekend that had Rock Band at the wedding and your daughter.
4798.16,4801.44," Your daughter was like, look and over, like, she came up with Charlie."
4801.44,4805.8, When is it my turn to actually I was a wedding of Karen Chu of this legendary thread?
4805.8,4806.8, It was.
4806.84,4810.88," Actually had, um, still alive as one of the professional's."
4810.88,4811.88, Really?
4811.88,4812.88, Yeah.
4812.88,4813.88, Yeah.
4813.88,4814.88, I'll get to our rage.
4814.88,4815.88, Just still alive as she walked on the.
4815.88,4816.88, Wow.
4816.88,4817.88, Yeah.
4817.88,4818.88," The gamer, two gamer wedding."
4818.88,4819.88, It is.
4819.88,4820.88, It was.
4820.88,4821.88, Yeah.
4821.88,4824.4800000000005," Like, yeah, for Rock, we have a kid like I did make sure the drums are not actually plugged in."
4824.4800000000005,4825.88, I just let her bang away and she's.
4825.88,4829.320000000001, Has she figured out that they're not plugged in yet?
4829.320000000001,4832.28," Not quite, but she's figured out enough that like, she, she gets mad."
4832.28,4834.88, I don't have to base pillow plugged in if it's not plugged in.
4834.88,4835.88, They're pretty savvy.
4835.96,4838.36," So it's like, she's like, she like, points to the base plug."
4838.36,4841.36," You know that me to like, bring it down and plug it in."
4841.36,4844.04, It looks like it kind of works and just bang on.
4844.04,4846.92, We actually used to do that with Ryan and his magazine articles.
4846.92,4848.24, I wasn't actually hooked.
4848.24,4849.4400000000005, This computer wasn't hooked up.
4849.4400000000005,4850.4400000000005, I'm not.
4850.4400000000005,4852.4400000000005," Yeah, just keep working on that article."
4852.4400000000005,4854.24," Yeah, we're going to print that."
4854.24,4856.24," Thanks, Queens, a lot."
4856.24,4857.24, I'm sorry.
4857.24,4861.24, It's also clear now.
4861.24,4863.36," You would think that was the case with you, too."
4863.36,4864.36, What?
4864.44,4867.2, Given how long some of yours took to actually come to fruition.
4867.2,4869.2, I was polishing fine gems.
4870.48,4872.08," Paul, all of that did."
4874.08,4875.2, Left myself open there.
4875.2,4876.16, I've been there Jeff.
4876.16,4877.0, Yeah.
4877.0,4877.2, Yeah.
4877.2,4877.839999999999, Okay.
4878.839999999999,4880.719999999999, How are we doing on time here?
4880.719999999999,4882.5199999999995," We should probably, you're right."
4882.5199999999995,4883.24," Hey, wait, wait, wait."
4883.24,4884.88, I have a question for everybody before.
4884.88,4885.5599999999995, Sure.
4885.5599999999995,4886.44, Ryan said.
4886.44,4889.04," So, last this week, I'd all cut off my mouth."
4889.04,4889.679999999999, I am.
4889.679999999999,4890.44, Yeah.
4890.44,4891.5599999999995," Oh, it's coming back."
4891.5599999999995,4892.48, Isn't it this week?
4892.48,4893.48, This week?
4893.5599999999995,4894.32, It's a week.
4894.32,4894.839999999999, I saw it.
4894.839999999999,4895.839999999999, I thought it's a week.
4895.839999999999,4896.839999999999," No, it's this week."
4896.839999999999,4897.839999999999, There's very excited.
4897.839999999999,4898.839999999999, There's the third.
4898.839999999999,4899.839999999999, There's a tent.
4899.839999999999,4900.839999999999, Where did we left off?
4900.839999999999,4902.12, Does she have a thing to come?
4902.12,4903.12, That's right.
4903.12,4904.12, That's what you have to do.
4904.12,4905.12," Oh, what's this?"
4905.12,4906.12, It's got shot.
4906.12,4910.12, And then the other guy just got out of this a trader.
4910.12,4911.5199999999995, Michael just got out of this a trader.
4911.5199999999995,4912.5199999999995, Yep.
4912.5199999999995,4913.5199999999995, Right.
4913.5199999999995,4914.5199999999995, Okay.
4914.5199999999995,4915.5199999999995, It brought him in.
4915.5199999999995,4916.5199999999995, Right.
4916.5199999999995,4917.5199999999995, Yeah.
4917.5199999999995,4918.12, Which shows the creators that you shouldn't put the actors
4918.12,4919.12, in the credit.
4919.12,4920.959999999999, You're way through the whole season.
4920.959999999999,4921.959999999999, Episode eight.
4921.959999999999,4922.959999999999, Right.
4922.96,4923.96, That's a good age.
4923.96,4924.96, I'm like sag rules or whatever.
4924.96,4926.4," I'm like, well, why is this name here?"
4926.4,4927.72," Oh, he must be doing the boat."
4927.72,4928.72, Yeah.
4928.72,4929.72, That was the least surprising.
4929.72,4930.72," Yeah, that was not surprising."
4930.72,4933.32," Well, they confirmed he was coming back all these like news stories."
4933.32,4934.32, I know.
4934.32,4935.32, I know.
4935.32,4936.32, He's just stepped before this season.
4936.32,4937.32, And then it was in the credit.
4937.32,4938.32, Yeah.
4938.32,4939.32," But the couldable is a libyer, whatever."
4939.32,4940.72, Is this the year for a second and that.
4940.72,4941.72, That's the dream.
4941.72,4942.72, Right.
4942.72,4943.72, The next episode is a day before the board.
4943.72,4944.72, This is a Ben Flash forward.
4944.72,4945.72, Yeah.
4945.72,4946.72, Awesome.
4946.72,4947.72, Interesting.
4947.72,4948.72," You know, I'm very excited."
4948.72,4951.28," Well, you son, OPM, we always used to talk about last."
4951.28,4952.28, And how much junk color hated it.
4952.28,4954.48," Yeah, junk color would be on an up-sign bill."
4954.48,4955.48," Well, he went to the bank."
4955.48,4957.12," Did he back on the bandwagon, though?"
4957.12,4958.12, Cut.
4958.12,4960.12," I actually, at the movie, I've been chicken."
4960.12,4961.12, I had a lost discussion.
4961.12,4963.719999999999," Like, loss is sure that he actually hates the content."
4963.719999999999,4966.12, But he thinks everything else about it is so great that he watches it.
4966.12,4967.719999999999, What do you mean he hates the content?
4967.719999999999,4969.16, He thinks it's a riding terrible.
4969.16,4971.92, And that he's a he always backs on it on court in three.
4971.92,4972.92, That's what he watches it.
4972.92,4976.2, He watches it because of the production design and the actors.
4976.2,4979.8," But he, his question to be at the time was, why would you have the production"
4979.8,4980.8, design?
4980.8,4981.8, I only want PBS.
4981.8,4982.8, I don't want television.
4982.8,4983.8, I don't want television.
4983.8,4984.8, I don't want television.
4984.8,4985.8, I don't want television.
4985.8,4986.8, We're just kidding.
4986.8,4987.8, Yeah.
4987.8,4989.8," His question is, like, how embarrassing I first am totally."
4989.8,4992.8, This question would be the best actor or loss and worst actor or lost.
4992.8,4993.8, Who are you?
4993.8,4994.8, Who are you?
4994.8,4995.8, And worst actor or loss?
4995.8,4996.8, I.
4996.8,4999.8," We have a comment best and like, our worst kind of differed."
4999.8,5000.8, Kate and Jack.
5000.8,5001.8, Eight.
5001.8,5002.8, Eight.
5002.8,5003.8, Wait.
5003.8,5004.8, The characters are the actors.
5004.8,5005.8, I hate the characters.
5005.8,5006.8, Who's the worst actor?
5006.8,5007.8, Yeah.
5007.8,5008.8," Well, I mean, obviously I can't do the obvious Nicky and Paolo."
5008.8,5009.8, You're talking like me.
5009.8,5010.8, Yeah.
5010.8,5011.8, Normal.
5011.8,5012.8, Talking regular here.
5012.8,5013.8, Yeah.
5013.8,5014.8, We talked characters.
5014.8,5015.8, You're asking us about that.
5015.8,5018.8, He's acting and I think we start to acting.
5018.8,5020.8," Actually, that is awesome."
5020.8,5021.8, Hits.
5021.8,5022.8, Hits.
5022.8,5023.8, Yeah.
5023.8,5026.8, He also been graduated from my alma mater.
5026.8,5027.8, Really?
5027.8,5028.8, Trake University.
5028.8,5029.8, Iowa.
5029.8,5030.8, Yes.
5030.8,5031.8, Wow.
5031.8,5032.8, Yeah.
5032.8,5034.8, This side of the room and check out where things are.
5034.8,5035.8," Oh, we're going to get forward."
5035.8,5036.8, Yeah.
5036.8,5037.8, I'm going to be hanging out with you.
5037.8,5038.8, Yeah.
5038.8,5039.8, I could tell you.
5039.8,5040.8, You can then.
5040.8,5041.8, You can then.
5041.8,5042.8, They're the new retro nuts.
5042.8,5043.8, Yeah.
5043.8,5044.8, Um.
5044.8,5046.8," So Ben, I think is the best."
5046.8,5047.8, Emily Derivine.
5047.8,5049.8, She's kind of weak as an actress.
5049.8,5050.8, Wait.
5050.8,5051.8, Who's that?
5051.8,5052.8, Claire.
5052.8,5053.8," Well, she doesn't get much to do."
5053.8,5054.8," No, she doesn't get much to do."
5054.8,5056.8, But I hate the way she says bye bye.
5056.8,5057.8, Really?
5057.8,5061.8, She's her for being a brilliant.
5061.8,5062.8, Yeah.
5062.8,5063.8, I'm going to wait my bye bye.
5063.8,5064.8, Yeah.
5064.8,5065.8, It's bye bye.
5065.8,5066.78, Yeah.
5066.78,5067.78," I mean, she's."
5067.78,5068.78, She's a very.
5068.78,5069.78, She's a very good actor.
5069.78,5070.78, She's a very good actor.
5070.78,5071.78, She's a very good actor.
5071.78,5073.78," So, when I see Maybe you know, she's a very good actor."
5073.78,5074.78," And you know, she's a very good actor."
5074.78,5075.78," But I think I can tell you, that's the best actor."
5075.78,5077.78, But it's characters I hate Kate and Jack Kate is the wisseous con ever kind of time.
5077.78,5079.78," By, too, which is like, like, check out I both say like Ben has obviously"
5079.78,5080.78, best actor.
5080.78,5081.78, And his worst actor was.
5081.78,5083.78, The one playing Kate eventually.
5083.78,5084.78, Lily.
5084.78,5085.78, Cause he said there's a lot of stuff going on with our character.
5085.78,5087.78," General, but she doesn't pull off at all."
5087.78,5090.78, And he also said Ben Ben does a great job with every mature he's given with.
5090.78,5092.78, Like the ex and the ex.
5092.78,5093.78, Great job.
5096.78,5098.0199999999995," is still played up to his typecast,"
5098.0199999999995,5099.46," whether he has no rage beyond,"
5099.46,5100.94," like somewhat charismatic,"
5100.94,5101.78, that's what he's like.
5101.78,5103.259999999999, Even when you're watching a smoking ace
5103.259999999999,5104.34," where he's not the main character,"
5104.34,5105.42, you go like you feel weird
5105.42,5106.0599999999995," because he's like,"
5106.0599999999995,5107.54, I can't play a person as a piano.
5107.54,5108.46, I have to play like the
5108.46,5110.179999999999, some of the characters from the charming hero.
5110.179999999999,5111.0199999999995, No boy.
5111.0199999999995,5112.86, I was the oldest brother in part of your five.
5112.86,5114.0199999999995, I gotta be the leading guy
5114.0199999999995,5115.179999999999, and lost like the other.
5115.179999999999,5118.54, I didn't believe his down and out beard phase.
5118.54,5119.54," Yeah, no."
5119.54,5121.9," You know, it looked like like pom-hanks cast"
5121.9,5122.58, to a beard.
5122.58,5123.86, You have all that fucking thing.
5123.86,5125.58, So I was so like every time
5125.58,5127.18, like that they're in a dangerous situation
5127.18,5128.94, and you know like they've told you a character
5128.94,5130.54," is gonna die at keypoping,"
5130.54,5131.82, but it's gonna be catered jack.
5131.82,5132.66, I'm just kidding.
5132.66,5133.66, They can't do that.
5133.66,5134.5," Yeah, they can't."
5134.5,5135.34, They can't.
5135.34,5136.66, They kill those two or soier.
5136.66,5138.1, They're too much the digital strategy.
5138.1,5139.62, They have strength in the community right now.
5139.62,5140.46, They use to add.
5140.46,5141.66, Because they're in the future.
5141.66,5143.74, Abrams used to advertise things about how
5143.74,5145.18, like they would fuck what the audience
5145.18,5146.22," by saying like,"
5146.22,5147.5," yeah, we'll introduce a red shirt"
5147.5,5149.1, and lock will go walking on the island
5149.1,5150.5, and up and lock will get killed
5150.5,5151.42, and a red shirt will become
5151.42,5152.5, a new main character.
5152.5,5153.46," They used to actually say like,"
5153.46,5154.98, that's what fuck what you're expecting
5154.98,5156.299999999999, but they didn't quite do.
5156.299999999999,5158.62," Yeah, that dude plays Sawyer has grown on me"
5158.62,5159.139999999999, over the season.
5159.139999999999,5159.98, I like Sawyer.
5159.98,5161.179999999999, I thought he was too over the top
5161.179999999999,5162.54," at the beginning, but now I actually like"
5162.54,5163.379999999999, I'm almost shocked.
5163.379999999999,5165.259999999999," Well, see, we watch a talk"
5165.259999999999,5166.099999999999, while other things these day
5166.099999999999,5166.82," when he's not Sawyer like,"
5166.82,5168.259999999999," oh, that guy's actually not a"
5168.259999999999,5169.54, conniving asshole right?
5169.54,5171.78, He does have it in his contract
5171.78,5173.099999999999, though that his shirt has to be off
5173.099999999999,5174.459999999999, for a certain amount of minutes every.
5174.459999999999,5176.86, Where are you just gonna ask if we were
5176.86,5177.74, all caught up for a did you?
5177.74,5179.099999999999, I was trying to bring up a sauce
5179.099999999999,5181.0599999999995, because I'm sure best in our sectors.
5181.0599999999995,5181.98, And then we'll sign off.
5181.98,5183.94, Best is you have been of course.
5183.94,5185.94, I also maybe it's just because I like
5185.94,5187.98, the character so much because he does
5187.98,5188.82, wind.
5188.82,5189.82," Yeah, I'm a big fan."
5189.82,5191.179999999999, The hitman movie freaked me up
5191.179999999999,5193.339999999999," because I, I would see the actor"
5193.339999999999,5194.339999999999," and hitman would be like,"
5194.339999999999,5195.82, you're not calling a one brother.
5195.82,5196.82, You're not talking about the concept.
5196.82,5198.419999999999, What the hell you doing this movie instead?
5198.419999999999,5200.0199999999995, He plays like a Russian arms dealer
5200.0199999999995,5201.54," and it totally, it totally,"
5201.54,5202.98," I don't see it man,"
5202.98,5203.82, extremely.
5203.82,5205.5, But what does that bunch to be
5205.5,5206.7, getting on the island?
5206.7,5207.7, I don't know.
5207.7,5209.5," Sorry, it just made me a friend."
5209.5,5210.86," And then like the Owen,"
