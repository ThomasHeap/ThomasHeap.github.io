0.0,3.86, This is the one up radio network and now GFW radio
5.08,10.52, Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast for February 5th
11.16,13.16, 2007. I remember the date for once
13.8,16.0, This is a very special podcast this week
16.0,20.34, You know why because we're all here finally in the same room. Yay
20.84,26.66, John Malice off Judy jury duty. I think they convicted and executed that's come back totally good
26.66,31.740000000000002, Welcome back Sean hang on my homo. We're so the whole GFW crew is here
32.24,36.38," Oh, we didn't tell you the Sean went last week. We realized our name was too boring"
36.38,39.38," So we changed it. Oh, what is it? We're now the boobs show"
40.82,44.78, So we hope you're okay with that. We figured we get more readers that way for listeners
45.14,50.34, But over there works for me boobs for windows. Sean a Sean a LED okay there you're holding your
50.620000000000005,55.82," I think yeah, I'm curious because I have a headset that doesn't work on so while you can hear me"
55.82,58.74, It doesn't sound like I'm to me like I'm talking I can't hear you guys
58.74,63.4, You can't but it would be like if we were on the same room and I had light I was going to bed and I put my ear
63.4,69.44," Well plugs in and yeah, so that's where I'm at like it just there's a space there's like distance between us guys"
69.44,71.64, And you got this like I'm just gonna listen this time anyway
71.64,73.64, I had people who probably some yeah
73.64,76.74000000000001, That was too much of us a wise acre whatever
76.74000000000001,80.98, I don't listen to that Mike so listen to them. This will be the episode where I listen
80.98,85.86," No, I'm just gonna have an interesting statue of liberty pose going on here"
86.06,90.54," Well, I'll try not hold the court too because I can actually hear like every rustle makes anyway enough"
90.54,92.08," Okay, cool things great get your"
92.54,97.5," Yep, get the Sean the road actually everybody here introduce yourselves for the fine people in the audience"
98.02000000000001,104.02000000000001," Ryan Scott Gary Gladstone Sean Elliott Sean Maloy. Yeah, so we wanted to"
104.02000000000001,108.74000000000001, I was gonna do what we're talking about this week. I already blew that never mind you'll just have to find out
108.74,111.75999999999999, But the first thing we're gonna talk about is a follow up on last week's
113.41999999999999,119.25999999999999, query we had on nerds and do these still exist in the world because a reader asked us that and
121.38,125.41999999999999, We threw the question back and I think we got a lot of response on the message boards. Do you know me? Yeah
125.41999999999999,130.42, We got a lot of nerds wrote in his response to it. We we we we didn't know about nerds
130.62,138.04, Part of it had to do I think with the fact that the letter writer at least alleged to be a high school girl with an attraction to nerds
138.74,140.74, That could be part of the excitement going on
140.82000000000002,142.58, We's also another 40-year-old guy
142.58,146.70000000000002, But I think people really wanted to speak up like they were like you know we got like the younger generation
146.70000000000002,149.34, It was like we got our nerds like they were like standing up to be counted
149.66,155.66000000000003," You know even though we're in like a badger water, but so the big thing like I didn't have time to like read everyone's like"
155.66000000000003,161.3," Really like the length the exposition of like how they know nerds still exist, but as soon as we were done taping that one"
161.3,165.86," I kind of left like oh god, why didn't I just I know their nerds"
165.86,171.98000000000002, I know exactly what happened to them and I know like you know how they're counted and how we can I classify and find them located
171.98000000000002,172.98000000000002, I'm gonna stop nowadays
172.98000000000002,173.98000000000002, So we can tag you
173.98000000000002,175.98000000000002, Just to be just to be
175.98000000000002,178.98000000000002, So my whole theory is basically much
179.42000000000002,184.74, So much of what we were talking about as being nerd them just became like co-opted in a regular society so you had
185.86,191.3, You know computers everyone uses those the pencil protectors and I mean pocket protectors and all that kind of stuff
191.3,220.68, See the truth on sidesters
221.3,222.14000000000001, We were nervous.
222.14000000000001,222.98000000000002, We had the toy.
222.98000000000002,224.06," Oh yeah, but we had the toy."
224.06,226.42000000000002," So I memorized them the back of the box is name,"
226.42000000000002,227.9," but I'm glad because now,"
227.9,231.06, there's a way to define anyone with a Bluetooth headset.
231.06,233.26000000000002, He legitimizes low button.
233.26000000000002,234.46," So okay, so the nerds."
234.46,236.9," So anyway, got normal D&D,"
236.9,237.9, even that's not that bad.
237.9,239.94, It got a mainstream motion picture and stuff.
239.94,241.22000000000003," Even back then, it had a Saturday morning,"
241.22000000000003,242.06, our dude.
242.06,244.74, So what happened is they take it a step further.
244.74,246.34, It's like all about extremity now.
246.34,248.54000000000002, So if you're in a D&D now you're a LARPER.
248.54000000000002,250.3, Now you dress up like that shit.
250.3,253.02, And go play that stuff out in the field.
253.02,254.38000000000002," Yeah, you know, like, right."
254.38000000000002,259.38," Okay, there's like people that call themselves other kin."
259.38,261.66, And this is some seriously repugnant shit.
261.66,264.42," This is like, they might be some of our fans here,"
264.42,265.26, be careful.
265.26,266.98," Do you know, okay, I got to talk about this."
266.98,269.66, They think that they were born into this life
269.66,272.46000000000004," that they're the incarnation of, like instead of,"
272.46000000000004,274.34000000000003," you know, whatever, that they are like,"
274.34000000000003,276.7," you know, solid snake or whatever,"
276.7,278.54, some character for videos.
278.54,280.82, Like they think that that's who that they really are
280.82,283.62, these characters from video games and just fantasies.
283.62,285.42, So it's a bit of a racist complex.
285.42,287.54," So you tell me that some dude, like outside our office,"
287.54,288.62," underneath the cardboard box,"
288.62,289.94, thinking no one's gonna notice him or something.
289.94,292.1," I think, yeah, I think like back then, you know,"
292.1,293.94," like you would meet, you know,"
293.94,295.42, there'd be like two or three other kids
295.42,298.58000000000004, that were close enough as nerdy as you that you'd meet.
298.58000000000004,299.74," So in like junior high and high school,"
299.74,300.98, you can go to have lunch with them.
300.98,302.34000000000003," And that's where you're gonna draw the line,"
302.34000000000003,304.98, like your communal love of D&D and some of this stuff.
304.98,306.66, But now it's like you go on the internet.
306.66,308.22," And as soon as you post this stuff,"
308.22,311.1, you've immediately created like 50 more million people
311.1,312.18," with the same disease, you know."
312.18,314.38000000000005," It's like how everyone, another thing nerds,"
314.38000000000005,316.46000000000004," all are like self diagnosed asperger,"
316.46000000000004,320.34000000000003, it's like people like self diagnosed mildly autistic people.
320.34000000000003,321.62," What, you mean they don't get a guess."
321.62,324.34000000000003, Whatever the average research society.
324.34000000000003,325.18," Right, right."
325.18,326.58000000000004, But I'll talk about self diagnosed.
326.58000000000004,328.54," And that's why I'm not saying if you're they to say,"
328.54,329.90000000000003, I have asperger's cause.
329.90000000000003,331.5," Right, you know, like on,"
331.5,334.1," and then just like focusing on the part of my mind,"
334.1,336.54," I just sit here going, what's an asperger?"
336.54,339.66," I'm, I perform it one, one, you know, one facet of life."
339.66,342.3," Extraordinarily well, that happens to be reading anime"
342.3,343.46000000000004, or manga if you feel.
343.46000000000004,346.1," I mean, like that, you know what I'm saying?"
346.1,348.78000000000003, So basically he comes like some compensatory like skill
348.78000000000003,350.42, at reading manga.
350.42,351.26000000000005, Like help.
351.26000000000005,353.70000000000005, So it makes up for the fact that like when someone else
353.70000000000005,356.22," is in a room laughing at him, they have no understanding"
356.22,357.3, that they're being laughed at.
357.3,358.5, So it's basically pretty interesting.
358.5,359.3," It's an entry on Wikipedia,"
359.3,360.46000000000004, it justifies his own existence.
360.46000000000004,361.74," And then he's like, right."
361.74,362.94, And that's how you get other kid.
362.94,363.78000000000003, It's stuff.
363.78000000000003,365.22," So someone you make the post and then like whatever,"
365.22,367.38000000000005," I don't know, someone, if it was something off or whatever,"
367.38000000000005,369.22," but they basically said that, you know,"
369.22,371.26000000000005, make a post about it and then you've got a support group
371.26000000000005,372.94000000000005, in that very hour.
372.94000000000005,375.58000000000004," Okay, you're saying so to people like think,"
375.58000000000004,376.62, they're the manga characters.
376.62,377.46000000000004, What's the character?
377.46000000000004,379.02000000000004," Yeah, they're not getting the see the other kid."
379.02000000000004,379.86, Other kid.
379.86,382.46000000000004, It's O.D.H.E.R.K.I.N.
382.46000000000004,382.98, Put that for it.
382.98,385.62," So they actually think like they're horrified,"
385.62,388.34000000000003, they're linked or solid snake or whatever.
388.34000000000003,390.02000000000004," But yeah, as far as it goes, you know,"
390.02000000000004,392.90000000000003, it started off with like vampires and what's not in there.
392.90000000000003,394.1," People that think that they're thinking,"
394.1,395.34000000000003, the white wolf game may not forget.
395.34000000000003,396.34000000000003, They might not have to taste her.
396.34000000000003,397.34000000000003, You lied.
397.34000000000003,398.34000000000003, You know that.
398.34000000000003,399.34000000000003, That's all.
399.34000000000003,401.42," I mean, roleplaying one thing."
401.42,403.5," That seems like something else, something scary."
403.5,405.02000000000004," All right, it's not in the code you're supposed to."
405.02000000000004,405.86, It's a cosplay.
405.86,406.70000000000005, That's the other thing.
406.70000000000005,408.70000000000005, That's another manifestation of like that nerd.
408.70000000000005,410.1," And then you could point out all you,"
410.1,411.22, you're some hot girl.
411.22,413.34000000000003," Cosplay is nerd and hook me up,"
413.34000000000003,415.86, because I've seen some really hot cosplay.
415.86,417.38, It's out there.
417.38,419.42," Well, that might be the case."
419.42,423.1," But by and large, so you think it's like the people who like"
423.1,425.06, are really into like the night elf chick dancing
425.06,426.54, and the iron forge for money.
426.54,427.54, Like the case.
427.54,428.1, That was Tom.
428.1,429.54, But that's the last month.
429.54,430.06, Forget that.
430.06,431.26000000000005, And burning face.
431.26000000000005,431.86, You made a lot of money.
431.86,433.26000000000005, You made a lot of money.
433.26000000000005,435.70000000000005," So some other, there are other signs."
435.70000000000005,437.90000000000003," Oh, I should like, there are other signs."
437.90000000000003,442.62," I think for me, another clear sign of a nerd is when it's like"
442.62,445.18, being like completely in love with other cultures.
445.18,446.18," Like, you know, back in the day,"
446.18,447.98," you'd have like angle files or something like,"
447.98,450.62," I wanted to be a mod, you know, whatever."
450.62,451.90000000000003, Like you've got a vest bug.
451.9,454.34," But now it's like, you get the manga."
454.34,456.46," And then you talk about how, oh, you know what?"
456.46,459.97999999999996," It would happen if Japan would remiliterize, oh, God help a"
459.97999999999996,463.41999999999996, soul of one squad of ninjas would take out an entire division
463.41999999999996,465.62, and armed forces of any other country.
465.62,469.34," I mean, this kind of people use their all over the internet."
469.34,470.85999999999996," But they have a squad of the South, like, not a"
470.85999999999996,471.85999999999996, enemy.
471.85999999999996,474.09999999999997, This just sounds like I do not want to see the next revenge of the nerds
474.09999999999997,475.09999999999997, movie.
475.09999999999997,476.09999999999997, Pretty sudden.
476.09999999999997,477.65999999999997," Well, there were other subs that there were like spazas,"
477.65999999999997,479.85999999999996," you know, freaks and all that kind of stuff."
479.86,481.5, This is like some new.
481.5,484.1, It's like the Jeffrey Dom reversion of a spaz.
484.1,484.78000000000003, Wow.
484.78000000000003,485.78000000000003, I don't know that's takes it far.
485.78000000000003,487.58000000000004," They don't hurt, well, they hurt themselves, I guess."
487.58000000000004,489.94, But I don't know.
489.94,490.78000000000003, Wow.
490.78000000000003,492.22," Anyway, that was all the jokes."
492.22,493.06, Those people.
493.06,494.42, We know what the really happened to them.
494.42,495.58000000000004, We know what happened to them.
495.58000000000004,496.42, We what?
496.42,497.02000000000004, That was all just a big joke.
497.02000000000004,498.02000000000004, I take all that back.
498.02000000000004,500.54, Because we know what happened to nerds and what nerds are now.
500.54,502.62, They just call themselves retranauts.
502.62,503.46000000000004, Oh.
503.46000000000004,504.46000000000004, Oh.
504.46000000000004,505.46000000000004, Oh.
505.46000000000004,506.46000000000004, Oh.
506.46000000000004,507.46000000000004, OK.
507.46000000000004,508.46000000000004, It's on now.
508.46000000000004,509.46000000000004," No, no, no."
509.46,510.46," That was the lie, actually."
510.46,513.26," Actually, this was a lie, which was it."
513.26,514.26, Which one was it?
514.26,515.26, It's not believe it's lies.
515.26,518.26," Actually, what I did want to say, speaking of the retranauts."
518.26,520.6999999999999, I just don't know if you're about actually he wanted to transition.
520.6999999999999,523.26, Thank you for that nice game shows style segue.
523.26,526.38," Hey, speaking of retranauts."
526.38,530.42," Yeah, I just wanted to very quickly say, because there's a little bit of hate going out"
530.42,532.22, on the message towards a little bit.
532.22,537.78," Actual hate, not fake hate involving GFW in the retranauts."
537.78,542.62, So I just wanted a little time out in the frivolity just to say that actually we do love those
542.62,543.9, guys a lot.
543.9,548.5, We would there are co-workers and we're just kind of turned into the sort of sign felt
548.5,550.74," like hello, new men sort of thing."
550.74,554.78, I don't think there's really all started because randomly one day we were recording and
554.78,558.1, we had to finish and it was like our time was done.
558.1,561.02, It was the retranauts that were scheduled next.
561.02,562.02, And so we made a joke.
562.02,563.02, You made a joke.
563.02,564.02, I did.
564.02,565.02, Those damn retranauts.
565.02,566.02, Yeah.
566.02,567.02, They were kicking out of the room.
567.02,568.02, So it's a good idea.
568.02,569.02, Do you think they're retranauts?
569.02,570.02, Right.
570.02,571.02, Right.
571.02,572.02, Right.
572.02,573.02, Right.
573.02,576.42, We actually liked those guys and we're just kidding around.
576.42,580.02," But having said that, you know, fuck those guys."
580.02,581.02, It's done now.
581.02,584.78, We need it like we need to find an understanding of all the branch.
584.78,585.78, You are.
585.78,586.78, We are.
586.78,587.78, I think we have to write all the stuff.
587.78,591.06," Like basically all, I don't know, never mind."
591.06,593.06, So we pick out somebody else now.
593.06,594.06, The retranauts.
594.06,595.06, We got to find someone.
595.06,596.06, No.
596.0999999999999,597.06, I just wanted to.
597.06,599.06, Our podcast and describe this.
599.06,602.06," Remember that you read that Jeff is self, self hating."
602.06,603.06, Yeah.
603.06,604.06, Self hating nerds.
604.06,605.06, So hurting that perspective.
605.06,607.06, It's like we just spent 20 minutes on.
607.06,608.06, I'm not sure.
608.06,609.06, It's true.
609.06,610.06, So we hate ourselves.
610.06,611.06, Yes.
611.06,613.06, I want to night at.
613.06,614.06, Hammett.
614.06,616.06, So where do we go from here?
616.06,617.06, I know where we'll go.
617.06,621.06," Well, it's to a quick round because it's been a while to a quick round of what"
621.06,625.06," you're playing because I, because Ryze's been playing something quite interesting for"
625.06,628.06, Mr. Scott and also we haven't checked in with Sean Mloin a while.
628.06,629.06, You know the answer to that one.
629.06,630.06, I do that.
630.06,631.06, I do that.
631.06,632.06, I do that.
632.06,633.06, Whatever you can play well being on jury duty.
633.06,635.06," Well, the other true."
635.06,637.06," So Ryan, you have a public confession to make."
637.06,638.06, Make it.
638.06,640.06," Well, being Sean can do this one together."
640.06,642.06, I've been playing World of Warcraft.
642.06,648.06," It's not really, I mean, that's no big."
648.06,652.06," It's not like, no one the whole rest of your world is like that."
652.06,654.06, But it was the rest of the world except Ryan.
654.06,655.06, He was the writer.
655.06,656.06, He was like a lone lone.
656.06,657.06, He was like a lone lone.
657.06,659.06," I'll never intended to, but I'm very special."
659.06,662.06," So when I hit on match dot kind of, it's."
662.06,664.06, It was the place to be.
664.06,666.06, How do you now?
666.06,668.06, So what happened?
668.06,673.06," Well, it's kind of just you know after Bernie Crusade came out, and I saw like kind of"
673.06,674.06, a huge response.
674.06,676.06, 2.4 million sold in a day.
676.06,677.06, Hype bandwagon.
677.06,679.06," Well, I kind of wanted to."
679.06,680.06, Way to fall par a.
680.06,681.06, I saw going to be sort of.
681.06,682.06," Yeah, I mean, I kind of just set."
682.06,683.7399999999999," I mean, I kind of just set that."
683.7399999999999,684.4599999999999, You are okay.
684.4599999999999,685.4599999999999, That's an army.
685.4599999999999,687.02, I need to look at this.
687.02,689.26, Like I can't keep ignoring this.
689.26,691.26, Maybe I should get it.
691.26,693.78, They fit it out one more time.
693.78,696.78," And you know, plan to the first few levels,"
696.78,700.3," you know, like all the go kill A to B to go."
700.3,700.8199999999999, Yeah.
700.8199999999999,701.78, Can't have these quests.
701.78,703.8199999999999," You know, I've done the same stuff in your course."
703.8199999999999,705.9799999999999," You know, I've done some change in that level 60."
705.9799999999999,706.8199999999999, Yeah.
706.8199999999999,707.42, Without complaining.
707.42,709.9799999999999, Just takes 60 hours to do it.
709.9799999999999,711.18, Right.
711.18,713.06," But it's, you know, so far."
713.06,716.0999999999999," I mean, it's, but you didn't stop you haven't stopped playing."
716.0999999999999,717.38, Right.
717.38,718.9," Like you, you installed it."
718.9,720.2199999999999, You wanted to the opening class.
720.2199999999999,722.0999999999999, And then you didn't go screw this.
722.0999999999999,722.62, I didn't.
722.62,728.9399999999999," Well, I have a friend who's been asking me to play for two years now."
728.9399999999999,730.26, What kind of friend?
730.26,732.54, A friend.
732.54,734.9, One charge is real life.
734.9,736.54, A real life friend.
736.54,737.54, Okay.
737.54,738.54, It's not your imagination.
738.54,740.9799999999999," I have a, three or four of my friends"
740.98,742.1800000000001, play on this PVP server.
742.1800000000001,746.74," So I said, okay, I'll give it the benefit of it out and play to a level 20, at least,"
746.74,749.1, which is what I was being asked to do.
749.1,750.1, So.
750.1,751.1, Right.
751.1,752.1, Where are you now?
752.1,753.7, I'm level 17.
753.7,754.7, After a weekend.
754.7,755.7," No, no, no, no."
755.7,759.1, I spent quite a bit of time this weekend playing.
759.1,762.34, And I think I'd only been playing for two days prior to that.
762.34,763.34, It doesn't take a while.
763.34,764.34, It actually doesn't take that long.
764.34,765.34, Yeah.
765.34,766.34, Yeah.
766.34,767.34, Not when you got to push that hand.
767.34,769.34, I touched that way.
769.34,770.94, How did you do all that?
771.4200000000001,778.1," But I'm so your impressions are favorable coming for as a guild wars,"
778.1,780.1400000000001," junkie and, and, uh,"
780.1400000000001,781.4200000000001, reponent.
781.4200000000001,782.1400000000001, So far.
782.1400000000001,786.5400000000001," Like the PVE stuff for some reason I've always wanted to like,"
786.5400000000001,790.62," compare to everquest one, because that's like my big baseline for how those,"
790.62,791.6600000000001, those kinds of games were.
791.6600000000001,792.7," Yeah, yeah, that's true."
792.7,793.86, I can't really do that.
793.86,794.6600000000001, Why?
794.6600000000001,798.86," It's, I mean, to everquest one when it came out, at least at the time, you know, we were all playing."
798.86,804.14," It didn't have all the, like, quests and, yeah, that sort of stuff that, that wow has."
804.14,809.22," Talking about it now, are you thinking about how you, you're, you already go home and play it tonight?"
809.22,810.22, Kinda.
810.22,811.22," Well, there you go."
811.22,812.22, You know what?
812.22,813.22, Then that's a win.
813.22,814.22," Go, that's the answer to you."
814.22,819.9," I mean, I think it's ultimately going to come down to like how good the PVP is and all that stuff."
819.9,824.62," I haven't tried that stuff out, but that's what I'm really eager to check out."
824.62,826.1800000000001," Although Ryan's talking, I've seen the, here I go."
826.1800000000001,827.82," I gotta go back to, I'll can do it tonight."
828.7800000000001,830.6600000000001," I need my, point five pants."
830.6600000000001,832.38, I'm just pointed.
832.38,837.0600000000001," Like, I, I, I noted this, like, when it, the game first came out when I played, I played a character"
837.0600000000001,840.0200000000001," to like, level eight or something when the first came out and I said, screw this."
840.0200000000001,845.58," But, um, one of the things that bothered me to end, bothered me now is, um, how little"
845.58,849.22," variety you have and, and how your character looks."
849.22,850.22," That is, that's true."
850.22,851.22, That's true.
851.22,852.46," Problem that is plagued, it's at the beginning."
852.46,856.1400000000001," Like, right at, like, at the end of the world of work, I've free burning per se."
856.14,860.6999999999999," Like, if you were an end game player, you looked exactly like every other end game player."
860.6999999999999,862.8199999999999, You got the same set of gear from the same place.
862.8199999999999,865.9, And they're trying to sort of maybe correct that a little bit.
865.9,867.34, They're not really sure if they will go.
867.34,873.26," Even from the very beginning, when we're looking at the original beta of, of the original game,"
873.26,875.18," it was, I was surprised by that."
875.18,877.9," It was like, how come I can't change my face more?"
877.9,881.7," You know, it seemed, you know, it's only five different kinds of eyes."
881.7,883.5," I mean, I got used to it."
883.58,884.5, It's fine.
884.5,886.26, There's a level of customization that's too much.
886.26,888.86," Like, if you're looking at, yeah, I request to you just like, why am I changing my eye color?"
888.86,889.86, No one's going to see this.
889.86,890.86," Yes, it was crazy."
890.86,892.14, It's just too many choices.
892.14,894.02," At that point, then I'm just hitting the random button."
894.02,896.7," World of workouts kind of the other end, where you're just like, I wish I had some more"
896.7,899.26," because it really does, like, everyone does look very similar."
899.26,903.94," But I assume they did that on purpose pretty much to keep, you know, everything down"
903.94,906.26, in terms of system requirements and things like that.
906.26,907.26, I'm sure that's part of it.
907.26,909.26, It was as a quick counterpoint though.
909.26,912.7," I mean, I think one of the best parts of city I heroes was sitting down and just creating"
912.7800000000001,916.38," all your characters with all the, all the different customizable factors."
916.38,919.0200000000001," So, but to me, that was the whole, I think it was the game."
919.0200000000001,920.0200000000001, Exactly.
920.0200000000001,923.22, It's like making the doll and then I was actually on a me in the world.
923.22,925.7," After a while, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,"
925.7,927.1800000000001, that there was a lot of other things that didn't work.
927.1800000000001,929.34," Like, it, it kind of went away from the whole loot system."
929.34,932.1," That, you know, a lot of people fall, you know, fall in full with, wow."
932.1,936.4200000000001," So, if they kind of like, I guess, if they just had a little bit more or something, like,"
936.4200000000001,940.22," because I'm switching through the faces in, in, wow, like, for, when I'm creating a"
940.22,943.1800000000001," engineer something, and one guy looks almost identical to the other."
943.1800000000001,944.1800000000001," I can't, especially those guys."
944.1800000000001,947.22," I mean, until the difference in the end, like, you're looking at your ass, the whole game,"
947.22,948.22," anyway, so, true."
948.22,949.9," Like, I, like, I, like, every day."
949.9,950.9, Yeah.
950.9,952.9, Just like in real.
952.9,953.9, Yeah.
953.9,954.9," I quick up, looking at the mirror."
954.9,955.9," I, is hot."
955.9,956.9, Yeah.
956.9,958.9," Um, so, it's still look pretty good."
958.9,961.6600000000001," It's all about the loot back game, because you're wearing a helmet or you're wearing, you"
961.6600000000001,962.6600000000001," know, a piece of armor."
962.6600000000001,968.3000000000001," I still get comments on a couple, like the, the mind control hat, I wear as an engineer,"
968.3,972.54," you know, people still, like in the 60s will make comments on that hat."
972.54,973.54, Right.
973.54,974.54, It makes me feel good.
974.54,975.54, And there is a lot of made that.
975.54,978.8599999999999," There is a good variety of items and stuff, but the problem is, like, there's"
978.8599999999999,980.8199999999999," usually an, an accepted best item."
980.8199999999999,982.06," And yeah, I'm going to wear that."
982.06,983.2199999999999, And so everyone's got that best shoulder.
983.2199999999999,984.2199999999999," Yeah, whatever."
984.2199999999999,985.2199999999999, That kind of sucks.
985.2199999999999,988.66," So it's, so basically, it's like, at the very beginning, and at the very end, the"
988.66,990.62," very top level, the guys are going to look pretty much the same."
990.62,991.62, Yeah.
991.62,993.3," I'd call that a valid complaint, right?"
993.3,994.3, Here.
994.3,995.3, I support you.
995.3,996.3, Thank you.
996.3,997.3, I'm just bringing that approval.
997.3,998.3, Really?
998.3,999.8199999999999, I approve of that.
999.8199999999999,1000.8199999999999, Any other comments?
1000.8199999999999,1003.02," So far, you're going to go home and play tonight."
1003.02,1004.02, That's cool.
1004.02,1005.02, Probably.
1005.02,1006.02, But you weren't right.
1006.02,1007.02, weren't you sent earlier?
1007.02,1008.02, How you were kind of comparing it?
1008.02,1009.02, So you're saying it was the Xbox of.
1009.02,1010.02," Oh, yeah."
1010.02,1011.02," That was, yeah."
1011.02,1015.06," Well, when the, when the Xbox came out, and this is the same for the dream"
1015.06,1016.78," cast and the PlayStation 1, too."
1016.78,1018.06, And so saw that.
1018.06,1020.9, I was kind of like down on it by default.
1020.9,1025.06," But essentially, this isn't Nintendo."
1025.06,1026.06, That's your Nintendo.
1026.1399999999999,1027.06, Yeah.
1027.06,1028.06, Yeah.
1028.06,1029.7," Especially back in like the Genesis, like the Game Cast State and stuff."
1029.7,1032.6599999999999, I didn't get a dream cast until they were 20 bucks used at Blockbuster.
1032.6599999999999,1033.6599999999999, That's true.
1033.6599999999999,1034.6599999999999, Right.
1034.6599999999999,1036.46, Which I regret.
1036.46,1039.82," But, you know, I was pretty much down on those because it's like, well,"
1039.82,1042.1399999999999," screw this, Nintendo's awesome."
1042.1399999999999,1047.86," And then for whatever reason one day, I'd say, okay, I had to stop thinking this"
1047.86,1048.86, way.
1048.86,1052.1," Because that's dirty and wrong and kind of lose our issue, right?"
1052.1,1053.1," And well, sorry."
1053.1,1054.1, They made a put words.
1054.1,1055.1, Thank you.
1055.1399999999999,1057.1799999999998, And I want to mention it.
1057.1799999999998,1060.1," But um, so this is sort of like that."
1060.1,1061.1, Yeah.
1061.1,1063.1399999999999, So how similar to that is it?
1063.1399999999999,1068.06," Because when you got over your Nintendo thing, well, let me, let me ask this."
1068.06,1070.26," This is a specific, a very specific question."
1070.26,1074.2199999999998," When you got over your Nintendo thing, it was a matter of like, Nintendo is what grandma"
1074.2199999999998,1075.2199999999998, Ruth bought you.
1075.2199999999998,1078.62," And when you got to the point where someone else got your PlayStation, then you like"
1078.62,1079.62," that, too."
1079.62,1083.4599999999998, So does this mean that grandma Ruth is finally willing to pay them monthly fee for
1083.46,1086.7," the World of Workcraft, which is killed where it was free."
1086.7,1092.7," Basically, you want to know if you're playing for your monthly subscription."
1092.7,1094.5, Is your grandma the special summoning?
1094.5,1095.5, All right.
1095.5,1098.38," So it is not the same, man."
1098.38,1102.18," I think it's like, it's the same in that like, wow, sort of like, 800-pound gorilla,"
1102.18,1104.82," like Sony or Microsoft, well, it's back against Nintendo."
1104.82,1105.94, Is it that kind of thing?
1105.94,1108.82," It's sort of, that's kind of how I was with with the Xbox."
1108.82,1110.3," It's like, oh, this is Microsoft."
1110.3,1112.7," Well, I'm not going to give Microsoft any of my money."
1112.94,1114.3400000000001," Of course, now that we work on it."
1114.3400000000001,1115.3400000000001," I run it, please."
1115.3400000000001,1116.3400000000001, Right.
1116.3400000000001,1121.14, Do you want to copy the privileges imagination and even make that innovate?
1121.14,1122.5, Or that simply steals.
1122.5,1125.18, That's what it takes from the other.
1125.18,1127.18, That's more imposing.
1127.18,1128.18, Wow.
1128.18,1129.18, A lot of it.
1129.18,1132.78," With MMO, it's like, a lot of my mentality comes down to like, okay, well, the ultimate online"
1132.78,1133.78, it's not.
1133.78,1134.78, You.
1134.78,1135.78, Right.
1135.78,1137.5800000000002, All the online is a terrible.
1137.5800000000002,1139.78," It's either a pilot, or a pilot."
1139.86,1144.74," So all, Krayal to my online is like, if Nintendo made nothing but Pokemon games."
1146.02,1146.86, What the?
1146.86,1147.86, Krayal?
1147.86,1148.86, Yeah.
1148.86,1149.86, That's what Krayal is.
1149.86,1150.86, It sucks.
1150.86,1152.7, So I just got a lot of money for me.
1152.7,1153.7, I got a train.
1153.7,1158.18," Making 9,000 ring gloves and then getting killed over and over again."
1158.18,1159.18, No.
1159.18,1160.86," After I got killed by a goat, how was that?"
1160.86,1161.86, All the time.
1161.86,1162.86, All the time.
1162.86,1163.86, He was killing you over and over.
1163.86,1164.86, I'll see you.
1164.86,1165.86, I'll see you.
1165.86,1167.86, I'll see you.
1168.2199999999998,1172.3," Well, there is a hearty and healthy PvP in, wow."
1172.3,1176.62," Uh, better on some servers than another, but it can be quite fun."
1176.62,1179.1, So you need to report back with your experience on.
1179.1,1180.82, Are you talking about just the battlegrounds or?
1180.82,1181.6599999999999, No.
1181.6599999999999,1183.1, That's just any PvP server.
1183.1,1185.8999999999999, I haven't gotten gangped yet or anything.
1185.8999999999999,1186.8999999999999," Oh, it will happen."
1186.8999999999999,1188.3, I'm on death wing.
1188.3,1189.3, Just you wait.
1189.3,1190.3, You're coming up and just come back.
1190.3,1191.34, I'm gonna go for a fail.
1191.34,1192.9399999999998, It is a gang of ill.
1192.9399999999998,1193.9399999999998," Oh, I shot a shot."
1193.9399999999998,1195.34, I'm gonna get some of that.
1195.34,1196.34, Passing out.
1196.4199999999998,1199.1, And I'm gonna get the rest and he doesn't want to just want to.
1199.1,1199.9399999999998, Is it the wrong building?
1199.9399999999998,1201.58, I'm in the legendary 3rd podcast.
1201.58,1202.1, Yeah.
1202.1,1203.1, I know.
1203.1,1203.8999999999999, I try to save it up for an inch and.
1203.8999999999999,1209.58, But all I have to do is to get the five of us are also frequent guests and
1209.58,1210.58, hosts or whatever.
1210.58,1213.02," However, it works on the wow, only podcast."
1213.02,1213.3799999999999, Yeah.
1213.3799999999999,1215.1, I basically get out of you joined by Ryan.
1215.1,1216.78," Uh, I'm just being hit in the hole."
1216.78,1220.02, One up so please forget if I don't hear about that shit anymore.
1220.02,1222.22, I'll come up to.
1222.22,1224.4199999999998," I'm, okay, obsessively every free minute I have."
1224.4199999999998,1226.26," Well, Sean, you just wildly."
1226.34,1228.14, You were doing jury duty.
1228.14,1229.5, You were also playing burning crusade.
1229.5,1231.54, It's Leslie because of the review.
1231.54,1232.06, Yeah.
1232.06,1233.5, Which just got posted on one up.
1233.5,1234.02, It did.
1234.02,1235.62, You would have been doing it anyway.
1235.62,1236.62," Well, first I would have."
1236.62,1239.1, We just empowered him.
1239.1,1239.74, We enabled.
1239.74,1240.74, Right.
1240.74,1242.22," So I'm like, hit 69."
1242.22,1243.22, Wow.
1243.22,1244.22, Damn.
1244.22,1245.54, That doesn't take long.
1245.54,1250.98, There were 70s like within days like my guild had a bunch of 70s last week.
1250.98,1251.98, That's nothing.
1251.98,1255.02, There was 70 and like 28 hours or something.
1255.02,1256.02," Yeah, but he was a friend."
1256.02,1258.62, The idea is not to be a million dollar that game.
1258.62,1260.42," No, no, or just like 60 wasn't."
1260.42,1262.34, It's just like that kind of starts the next phase.
1262.34,1266.26," But I'm just wondering, like, if you race to hit 70, I mean, like at what point do you go,"
1266.26,1268.42," huh, I'm just going to slow down a little until."
1268.42,1272.1399999999999," No, some people are, some people who are crazy before and I'll take it real slow."
1272.1399999999999,1275.5," Like, it's pretty interesting to watch people go, okay, I'm going to take this nice and slow."
1275.5,1276.78," Well, they learned their lesson now."
1276.78,1281.06," Yeah, because they burned out or they couldn't, or no one else was at the highest level"
1281.06,1282.06, with them.
1282.06,1284.1399999999999, So they just kind of had to wait around and help them do the stupid stuff that they
1284.7,1285.5800000000002, powered through.
1285.5800000000002,1290.8600000000001," Also, just the fact that so much of the level 60, like gear and stuff is has been made"
1290.8600000000001,1293.38, null and void by the expansion stuff.
1293.38,1298.46, I would just think this time around maybe they're not going to be so anxious to do
1298.46,1300.5400000000002, every little thing.
1300.5400000000002,1305.94," Right, you know, yeah, there's a level between a obsession and enjoyment that they may have found."
1305.94,1306.94, I hope they did.
1306.94,1309.22, That's enough of that though.
1309.22,1310.8600000000001, I'll be talking about this on legendary thing.
1310.8600000000001,1311.22, Okay.
1311.22,1312.5400000000002, Let's keep it to ride ride.
1312.54,1315.1399999999999," Enough wow here, but we are glad you're back."
1315.1399999999999,1320.6599999999999," And yeah, listen, for more of Sean through my nations on legendary thread, the official"
1320.6599999999999,1322.54," stage of one out of work, I fuck."
1322.54,1324.54, You're one up network.
1324.54,1327.22, Are you recording that this week?
1327.22,1328.22, Tomorrow tomorrow.
1328.22,1329.22, Yeah.
1329.22,1330.22, Okay.
1330.22,1332.46," You are, because I have nothing more to say on that podcast."
1332.46,1333.46, You're done.
1333.46,1334.46, I'm just been.
1334.46,1335.46, Okay.
1335.46,1339.94," Sean, Elliott, you've patiently been listening to this nonsense."
1339.94,1343.66," Do you want to chime in with some counter, some like shooting, shooting, bang bang, game,"
1343.66,1344.66, even playing.
1344.66,1346.66," One of your little shoot, one year, what all, you know."
1346.66,1349.66," Oh, I'm the fastest, so I win."
1349.66,1354.54," I'm in a supplant, I play increasingly all sorts of games."
1354.54,1358.06," Hey, did you get a chance to go back to about a battle station's been waiting at the"
1358.06,1363.38, final retail code or I tried to play it last night in over the weekend in my gaming
1363.38,1364.98," session, but this happens."
1364.98,1368.02," Trouble basically, you're like linking up to games."
1368.02,1371.22," And I was saying it's such a console game that like when someone joins the server, you"
1371.22,1372.86," make, you want to kick them."
1372.86,1377.34," You have to press the button and then another like option comes up on screen and it says,"
1377.34,1378.7, are you sure you want to kick them?
1378.7,1381.82," Instead of just hitting like wire something, you have to move the mouse over and click"
1381.82,1382.82, like the yes.
1382.82,1383.94, The whole thing is just like that.
1383.94,1386.74," So no, I haven't got to, got to play it much yet."
1386.74,1389.74," Like, I tried going back to it now that the final version."
1389.74,1392.82," And a lot of the things you were complaining about, the kind of throwing you in the deep"
1392.82,1393.82, end.
1393.82,1397.06," There is a naval academy, they call it basically a training area."
1397.3799999999999,1400.58," So it kind of breaks down for you, but still it doesn't quite cut it."
1400.58,1401.58, I went through the single player game.
1401.58,1403.5, I actually fell asleep at my computer the other night playing it.
1403.5,1404.5, Awesome.
1404.5,1406.3," Yeah, it's hard to be a glowing recommendation."
1406.3,1410.8999999999999," But even the degree of control, like we went back and played a bunch of secret weapons"
1410.8999999999999,1413.02, of World War II and just being able to control like the.
1413.02,1414.4199999999998," Yeah, I was thinking of something."
1414.4199999999998,1415.4199999999998, It was a simple thing.
1415.4199999999998,1417.34, The airplane combat in it was so much better.
1417.34,1418.62," But then again, it's a strictly air."
1418.62,1423.86," Although to go back, yeah, like it's amazing now, how completely like broken battlefield"
1423.86,1427.3, 42 was like how it's so clear now.
1427.3,1430.9799999999998," But at the time, it was like I was so excited because I'd always get a make sure I got"
1430.9799999999998,1431.9799999999998, a plane anyway.
1431.9799999999998,1434.8999999999999, But it's basically a pilot's game if you're in a map and there are planes on it.
1434.8999999999999,1438.6599999999999," And you don't have a plane, you might as well just like turn it off."
1438.6599999999999,1439.8999999999999," I mean, it's so bad."
1439.8999999999999,1442.78," I mean, it's like you mean, it's like, we make a weapon or just even the plane."
1442.78,1444.1799999999998, It's just battlefield 42.
1444.1799999999998,1448.82," I mean, if you go into a thing and there's planes on the map, it wasn't like that"
1448.82,1449.82, back at the beginning.
1449.82,1452.8999999999999," No, I didn't get that way pretty quickly."
1452.9,1454.0600000000002," I mean, there's still stuff you could do."
1454.0600000000002,1457.94," I'm exaggerating like you'll come across people, depending on the map where they're really"
1457.94,1458.94, good with AA or something.
1458.94,1461.9," But just like, I want to turn to a big battlefield reminiscent."
1461.9,1466.5400000000002," But like, yeah, especially secret weapons, if you go in and you get like the German flying"
1466.5400000000002,1470.9," wing and you know what to do, like say, for example, you go up really high and you come straight"
1470.9,1473.8600000000001," down on their flag because you know where the place in Tsar, where as they won't know"
1473.8600000000001,1474.8600000000001, where you're at.
1474.8600000000001,1476.3400000000001, And you take care of that.
1476.3400000000001,1479.1000000000001," Then pretty much you're going to have like by the end of the round, you might"
1479.1,1482.8999999999999," like 50 kills in the next person up could have like, you know, like 18 or something and"
1482.8999999999999,1486.1399999999999, you'll updive maybe one time and they'll updive like 40.
1486.1399999999999,1488.1399999999999," It's just, it's just enough to infuriate anyone."
1488.1399999999999,1489.6999999999998, I can't imagine playing when you don't get that.
1489.6999999999998,1493.06," And you'll see it as soon as you get, you get in fights where like, so maybe someone"
1493.06,1496.26, will get like the key flying vehicle.
1496.26,1499.2199999999998, So we'll all get whatever else we can or get on the flag and we'll shoot them down even
1499.2199999999998,1500.3799999999999, though he's a teammate.
1500.3799999999999,1502.3, And then like we'll just until we get it.
1502.3,1505.2199999999998," And then this is just something that allows us to sit, they're not getting the plane anymore"
1505.2199999999998,1506.62, than they just get the server.
1506.62,1507.62, Yeah.
1507.62,1509.3," But anyway, sorry, it doesn't look."
1510.7399999999998,1511.54, That's your camera memory.
1511.54,1512.54, That's right.
1512.54,1513.34, You can reminisce.
1513.34,1514.9799999999998, We're free here.
1514.9799999999998,1516.82, I still have three to be.
1516.82,1519.82, It just like the wow talking comes back every podcast.
1519.82,1523.58," You see, there's a I had this computer that it's always broken and I'm trying to get it"
1523.58,1524.58, fixed.
1524.58,1527.86," But when it does go up, it's going to have an 80, 800 in Windows Vista."
1527.86,1528.86, Really?
1528.86,1534.7399999999998, The first thing I do is install a flight sim and try that and direct X 10 and bunch of other
1534.7399999999998,1535.7399999999998, games have been sent down.
1535.74,1537.78, Is that going to be my copy of this that you installed?
1537.78,1538.78, You need to bring in for me.
1538.78,1539.98," All right, I'll bring it tomorrow."
1539.98,1542.26, So bad or I'm e-banked.
1542.26,1543.26, I don't.
1543.26,1547.58, We're ready for our break and then we're coming back.
1547.58,1548.58, We had.
1548.58,1549.58, We have to go.
1549.58,1550.58, Yep.
1550.58,1551.58, Yeah.
1551.58,1557.82, We're going to pass out some awards in our current now on sale.
1557.82,1559.46, We have our games of the year.
1559.46,1562.86, We're going to look at the opposite side of the gaming spectrum.
1562.86,1563.86, When we return.
1563.9799999999998,1568.5," We could say, quick on that, how thoroughly did we explain in the issue itself are"
1568.5,1571.3799999999999, reasoning for the way that we tackle the games of the year awards?
1571.3799999999999,1572.3799999999999, I think we did.
1572.3799999999999,1573.3799999999999, I think we did.
1573.3799999999999,1578.58," Well, we could do a three-feet right here before."
1578.58,1579.9799999999998, What will we get back from the break?
1579.9799999999998,1580.9799999999998," Well, we'll talk about quick."
1580.9799999999998,1581.9799999999998, We'll talk about quick.
1581.9799999999998,1584.2199999999998, We have a lot of listeners that don't necessarily do it in our magazine.
1584.2199999999998,1589.78, But I think it was a point like it's worth kind of wasting.
1589.78,1590.78, It's not there for people.
1590.78,1592.94, I think we did our best within the confines of print.
1592.94,1593.94, But let's talk about it.
1593.94,1594.94, Right after the break.
1594.94,1595.94, When we get back.
1595.94,1596.94, It's worth two.
1596.94,1597.94, That's worth two.
1597.94,1598.94, I think.
1598.94,1599.94, Worth.
1599.94,1601.94, To say that break on the count of three.
1601.94,1602.94, Right off.
1602.94,1603.94, Break it down.
1603.94,1604.94, Break it down.
1604.94,1605.94, Break it down.
1605.94,1606.94, We fingers.
1606.94,1608.94," Oh, hello."
1608.94,1610.94, I didn't see there.
1610.94,1617.74," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about E.G.M. live."
1617.74,1621.94," The weekly podcast from the editors of Electronic Giving Monthly, along with the wonderful"
1621.94,1625.22, sounds of...
1625.22,1625.46, E.G.M.
1625.46,1629.5," Live comes action-packed with special guests, late breaking news, fanboy baiting commentary"
1629.5,1635.02," behind scenes tales of office-tomphullery, and trivia contest with fan tabulous prizes."
1635.02,1636.18, Download it now at E.G.M.
1636.18,1639.18, Live.1up.com or subscribe to it through iTunes.
1639.18,1640.18, E.G.M.
1640.18,1643.66," Live is part of the one-up radio network, tip and tip-and-sip-divist offices and San Francisco."
1643.66,1647.42," It is not actually live, and contest prices are not guaranteed to be a fan tabulous."
1647.42,1648.42, E.G.M.
1648.42,1651.54, And we're back.
1651.54,1654.3400000000001," Is there actually a break this time, or do you think there's..."
1654.3400000000001,1656.3400000000001," Because if not, that's going to sound weird."
1656.3400000000001,1657.3400000000001, It's actually like a commercial.
1657.3400000000001,1658.3400000000001, I'll give it a second.
1658.3400000000001,1659.3400000000001, I'll give it a second.
1659.3400000000001,1660.3400000000001, Okay.
1660.3400000000001,1663.6200000000001, Hopefully it's not an ad by someone who's going to get an award now.
1663.6200000000001,1664.6200000000001, Okay.
1664.6200000000001,1665.6200000000001, That would've kind of suck.
1665.6200000000001,1666.6200000000001, That's what it works.
1666.6200000000001,1667.6200000000001, Okay.
1667.6200000000001,1674.18," So, so we did our games of the year in our current now-one-sale issue."
1674.22,1678.22, We did a top 10 of 2006 as how we did it.
1678.22,1684.42, Actually we got quite a lot of shit the year before because we didn't do any awards.
1684.42,1685.42, Which is kind of a long story.
1685.42,1686.42, And the reason...
1686.42,1687.42, The ultimate...
1687.42,1689.42," I mean, there are a number of reasons for that."
1689.42,1693.42," And part of it, like, I mean, the complicated ones are that we had something else in mind,"
1693.42,1695.42, but it ended up not happening.
1695.42,1699.14," But really, it's just, I think, in a version to that, to pick and low hanging fruit that"
1699.14,1700.14, we've had here.
1700.14,1701.14, It's true.
1701.14,1706.14," Where you see so often, and we're, you know, enthusiasts' presses involved, that there"
1706.14,1709.5400000000002, are just certain things that the magazines and websites just write them.
1709.5400000000002,1712.5400000000002, How many freaking top previews you have to use?
1712.5400000000002,1716.98," Yeah, you have top, you know, if your games of the year issue, then you've got, like,"
1716.98,1720.66," the press release comes out where a company Sony says, hey, did you know it's our 10-year"
1720.66,1722.6200000000001, anniversary for this piece of hardware?
1722.6200000000001,1725.98," And then you look around in every magazine, every website's got the story."
1725.98,1728.46," You see, I mean, those kind of things over and over again."
1728.46,1730.8600000000001, The quality of the game is September.
1730.8600000000001,1731.8600000000001, Fall pre.
1731.8600000000001,1734.58, The holiday gift got the top 10 of the next year.
1734.58,1736.5, It's the same goddamn thing over and over.
1736.5,1737.5, And we're guilty too.
1737.5,1738.5, Right.
1738.5,1739.7, So we've been trying to break them all along.
1739.7,1740.7, We can't.
1740.7,1741.7, And we did break it that year.
1741.7,1743.7," It was, it was basically, you know, getting it."
1743.7,1744.7, Getting for it.
1744.7,1746.7, But people want that.
1746.7,1748.7," They just, like, they want that."
1748.7,1751.02," Everyone, but some people crave that low hanging fruit."
1751.02,1752.02, Right.
1752.02,1754.18," Actually, if they don't, I mean, this is a part of the story."
1754.18,1758.42," We will say we did a something else plan for the, for the, for the, the retrospective."
1758.42,1760.38," Of 2005, it was."
1760.38,1765.22," And what we were going to do was have in a side bar the top, the games of the year."
1765.22,1766.22, Right.
1766.22,1767.46, We're still going to give throw that bone.
1767.46,1768.46, But then the whole story's got to be.
1768.46,1773.3000000000002," We're just naturally in the, in the, in the course of the big solid story that"
1773.3000000000002,1776.66," looked, it evaluated the trends of the year in the developments in the, in the, in the, in the,"
1776.66,1777.66," yeah, gaming space."
1777.66,1778.66, Exactly.
1778.66,1782.14," Put, put the, noteworthy product in that context, you know."
1782.14,1784.6200000000001," And that's what we tried, that's what we were originally going to try to do this year."
1784.6200000000001,1787.22, But I think we just had to go with the top 10 games that made them.
1787.22,1788.22, We did.
1788.22,1789.8600000000001, We had to have to compromise this year.
1789.8600000000001,1793.66," I think where we just combined, we dovetailed in what we saw as being, you know, the"
1793.66,1797.5, noteworthy trends and whatnot of the year into the games that were all also noteworthy
1797.5,1798.5, to us.
1798.5,1802.1000000000001," But the biggest accomplishment, I think, in doing the 10 rather than breaking it down."
1802.1000000000001,1804.78," And this is what we say in the story, rather than breaking it down according to"
1804.78,1810.38," genre is that you get these absurd scenarios where say, there's, runner up and even, you know,"
1810.38,1812.46, second runner up for one genre one year.
1812.46,1814.74," Hey, you can ask you for some RTS here."
1814.74,1816.8600000000001," Say, Jean, not genre."
1817.3799999999999,1818.8999999999999," Okay, I'm just saying that because I'm, you're sure."
1818.8999999999999,1822.78," Oh, man, you should have, my friends, why thanks to you."
1822.78,1824.3799999999999," Okay, please continue really."
1824.3799999999999,1826.3799999999999," It's like, go for me."
1826.3799999999999,1834.26," Okay, so if you, if you break it down by Jean, you're going to have a second runner up."
1834.26,1839.82," For example, RTS that might be far more noteworthy than say what's going to win in a category"
1839.82,1841.5, that was particularly weak that year.
1841.5,1842.5, Right.
1842.5,1844.62, The category could be MMO as it was this year.
1844.62,1845.62, Right.
1845.6999999999998,1847.1, So words for D&D online.
1847.1,1848.1," Oh, good."
1848.1,1852.4199999999998," And it's like, so D&D online ends up getting this big blurb and big set of recognition"
1852.4199999999998,1857.26," where, you know, like, what if it was the year that like two, you know, whatever it is."
1857.26,1861.4199999999998," The way we thought about the RTS was this year was that there were like, you know,"
1861.4199999999998,1863.3799999999999, at least four great RTS is right.
1863.3799999999999,1865.9399999999998, Only one would get an award if we did a genre award.
1865.9399999999998,1869.2199999999998, Whereas those other three were better than most other games than any genre on the
1869.2199999999998,1870.2199999999998, piece.
1870.2199999999998,1871.2199999999998," Yeah, the best of all."
1871.2199999999998,1873.82, The best of all for in past years would be like if an RTS were to win game of the year.
1873.82,1876.62, And then we were able to free a slot for another RTS to win.
1876.62,1877.26," Yeah, that's true."
1877.26,1879.8999999999999, But you're D&D online example.
1879.8999999999999,1884.4199999999998, I thought it was perfect because I did see that that got like quote MMO of the year in other
1884.4199999999998,1885.4199999999998, sites.
1885.4199999999998,1887.02," And I was like, well, that's because it was the only one that came out."
1887.02,1891.82," And I, there's the one where the text for it was like, you could tell like, no,"
1891.82,1896.5, you could see just like how like mangled the mind was that was processing it because it
1896.5,1903.1799999999998," was like, you know, in a year when there were hardly any MMO games D&D online somehow"
1903.18,1905.18, managed to come out on top.
1905.18,1907.18," They were like, they wanted so badly."
1907.18,1911.02," So desperately to say that this game came out on top that you're like, I'm right now."
1911.02,1913.02, I don't give a fuck when I wrote it.
1913.02,1914.02, This one one.
1914.02,1916.02," You know, it's so stupid."
1916.02,1918.46," Yeah, I was like, this is like a little bit of water."
1918.46,1921.0600000000002, It would take like two seconds to parse that sentence to go.
1921.0600000000002,1922.0600000000002," Oh, yeah."
1922.0600000000002,1923.0600000000002, Okay.
1923.0600000000002,1924.3, So there weren't any others.
1924.3,1925.3, Right.
1925.3,1926.3," I mean, in the long."
1926.3,1927.3," Yeah, I'm having that."
1927.3,1930.6200000000001, So some part of it was to avoid situations like that.
1930.62,1936.7399999999998," The other being that again, that that is the recognized standard boiler plate for the"
1936.7399999999998,1937.7399999999998, industry.
1937.7399999999998,1939.4599999999998, This is how you have your game of the year awards.
1939.4599999999998,1942.6999999999998," And then if you want to tack on some readers, choice ones, you do that and you break"
1942.6999999999998,1945.58, them down according to the same lines.
1945.58,1950.1," And you know, we do know and I don't want to make it sound like we're completely, you"
1950.1,1954.4199999999998," know, begrudging that we did this because there is something to be said for a magazine"
1954.4199999999998,1958.3799999999999," of a certain authority, recognizing certain achievements in the industry."
1958.3799999999999,1959.3799999999999, That's fine.
1959.46,1960.38, Talk about this.
1960.38,1962.42," No, I meant EGM."
1962.42,1963.42, Right.
1963.42,1964.42, And we did.
1964.42,1965.42," And there are, it was just small."
1965.42,1968.6200000000001," We wanted to like, if you want to give a specific, I mean, that was the other thing."
1968.6200000000001,1971.0200000000002, We were almost going to do the entire thing.
1971.0200000000002,1977.18," Instead of now we have a specific, like, a combination for art direction and for character"
1977.18,1978.7800000000002, development and all these other aspects.
1978.7800000000002,1983.2600000000002," But that was actually, that was going to be an option for like the like principle method"
1983.2600000000002,1986.6200000000001," of organizing the feature, right, which I would have been totally fine with that."
1986.6200000000001,1988.0200000000002," I would have, I think that beats."
1988.1,1989.46, I think I think it's a good compromise either way.
1989.46,1992.78," I'm just happy that we stuck, we stepped away from the genre awards."
1992.78,1993.78," Yeah, yeah."
1993.78,1996.18, It was very liberating.
1996.18,1997.78, And I feel like I'm happy with the list.
1997.78,1998.78, I look at that.
1998.78,2001.06," That whole shit about France, we got to take a quick thing."
2001.06,2002.62, It's like I actually took for it.
2002.62,2004.62," For itch in high school and college, you know."
2004.62,2007.7," And so, but of course, here you end up writing it."
2007.7,2009.62, I can actually read a good deal and whatnot.
2009.62,2013.46," But, but that's one reason why I've never been to France and I don't want to go."
2013.46,2014.46, It's like think of America.
2014.46,2017.66, Think of the first person that comes to you and speaks with you in the accent.
2017.74,2021.38, Yeah. Whatever it may be and learn how many we hear every day.
2021.38,2025.74," We're like, no, you asshole, pronounced money."
2025.74,2026.6200000000001, You know what I mean?
2026.6200000000001,2028.6200000000001, It's like we would never do that to someone.
2028.6200000000001,2030.5," So, but they don't introduce in the air."
2030.5,2033.38, I think Americans are actually a lot cooler and more dominating.
2033.38,2034.38, I haven't come to that.
2034.38,2034.9, Just kidding.
2034.9,2036.78, Unless you think something different from what we think.
2036.78,2038.74, Then you're uncle.
2038.74,2039.74, Right.
2039.74,2045.02," Actually, it's, it's the truth is, if you go over, if you go to France and try to speak French,"
2045.02,2047.1000000000001, they will love you just for trying.
2047.1799999999998,2051.58," Oh, I heard from other people that have been there that, ah, they would rather you"
2051.58,2054.3399999999997, not butcher their attempt to butcher their language.
2054.3399999999997,2055.62, Rather not even try.
2055.62,2057.06, It may depend on what you are.
2057.06,2057.58, Yeah.
2057.58,2059.18," So, they saw us in terms of the male and female."
2059.18,2059.54, Right.
2059.54,2061.54, I'm been there and I married to a French person.
2061.54,2061.74, Right.
2061.74,2063.74, Here's what I should be happy.
2063.74,2064.3399999999997, Yeah.
2064.3399999999997,2064.86, Right.
2064.86,2065.74, Yeah.
2065.74,2066.22, Okay.
2066.22,2067.22, Let's have some.
2067.22,2068.42, So let's find your ring.
2068.42,2069.22, I'll grill her.
2069.22,2071.22, Why are your people such assholes?
2071.22,2071.74, Yeah.
2071.74,2074.14," Well, we have got a whole lot to answer for."
2074.14,2078.9," But in that one specific, you know, it's, that's one thing where I think like a proud"
2078.9,2081.18, people can come up to you and you can't understand the words they're saying.
2081.18,2082.18, Like that's cool.
2082.18,2083.54, I think I made sense of that.
2083.54,2085.3799999999997," And when I do, I'll give you the answer."
2085.3799999999997,2089.46, Like not like the why are you trying to talk to me in this language?
2089.46,2092.14," You know, you just assume you're like, that's red."
2092.14,2093.14, You're learning another language.
2093.14,2094.14, That's awesome.
2094.14,2095.14," Well, they're not everyone."
2095.14,2096.14, I'll tell you.
2096.14,2097.14, I'll tell you one.
2097.14,2102.3799999999997," I'll tell you one tiny anecdote that I saw in Paris, which is that I was standing"
2102.38,2105.38," around on the, on the street corner."
2105.38,2106.38, That sounds a little weird.
2106.38,2108.38, I wasn't like doing track position.
2108.38,2110.38, Wasn't doing tricks or what's it.
2110.38,2111.38, Watch out for my wife.
2111.38,2115.1400000000003, I'm not going to be a monkey that can smoke a cigarette and write my signal.
2115.1400000000003,2117.86, And for those of my job before being at this man.
2117.86,2118.86, Performing sockets or something.
2118.86,2124.54," No, I was standing around waiting for my wife and, uh, don't say a clap stand."
2124.54,2126.38," So you don't say cry, or a creep."
2126.38,2127.86, It's clap stand.
2127.86,2131.7000000000003," And this, this young woman was selling these, uh, confectioners."
2131.7,2132.7," No, these, what are they?"
2132.7,2133.7, The patissigli.
2133.7,2134.7, Thank you.
2134.7,2139.06, And an American guy walks up.
2139.06,2144.62," And he says in a, in a, you know, American voice with no, no even attempt to"
2144.62,2146.1, announce it in English.
2146.1,2147.1, Strawberry please.
2147.1,2148.1, He's be creamed.
2148.1,2149.1, So it's a strawberry.
2149.1,2150.1," Oh, nice."
2150.1,2151.74, Now this is someone who doesn't speak English.
2151.74,2152.74, Right.
2152.74,2153.74, In just humans.
2153.74,2155.4199999999996," And she's just like, you know, what?"
2155.4199999999996,2157.5, I just strawberry please.
2157.5,2161.58," And you know, it's as if we were here, you know, or you're at a store here."
2161.58,2164.34, That say Chinese person comes up to you and just tries to love.
2164.34,2169.5," But if he was like, you and, friends, who plays like that, that's at least different than,"
2169.5,2174.8199999999997," I mean, that's him, like, butchering, you know, to like, horrible degree like French language."
2174.8199999999997,2176.7799999999997, And I would have made this one a try for that.
2176.7799999999997,2177.7799999999997, But at least he would have tried.
2177.7799999999997,2182.14," I mean, I think at least she would have had some understanding what he was trying to say,"
2182.14,2184.9, because I actually interrupted there and did the transaction.
2184.9,2189.14," And I said, what is in fact, you say pickled muppet hearts and friends."
2190.1,2191.14, The curde.
2197.14,2197.74, Okay.
2197.74,2197.94, Okay.
2197.94,2198.74, So back.
2198.74,2198.94, Yeah.
2198.94,2200.66," Well, the reason we're talking that we were."
2200.66,2201.58, We have so long ago.
2201.58,2206.3799999999997, We were talking about games in the year because we wanted to give out.
2207.66,2208.8599999999997, We don't have a name form.
2208.8599999999997,2210.7, We just have to have a picture of the year.
2210.7,2211.46, So sure.
2211.46,2211.9, Yeah.
2211.9,2212.2599999999998, Yeah.
2212.2599999999998,2212.74, Right.
2212.74,2215.9, And then we talk about a talk that calling it the cost of the year.
2216.3799999999997,2217.7799999999997, That's going to be a little too far.
2217.78,2219.1800000000003, Is it you think it's that too mean?
2219.1800000000003,2221.6600000000003, That's being a little too proud of your cheesy pun.
2221.6600000000003,2222.02, I think.
2222.02,2223.02, I think.
2223.02,2224.02, It's.
2224.02,2226.6200000000003, I'm not really thinking about what it means.
2226.6200000000003,2228.7000000000003, You're like those words sound similar.
2228.7000000000003,2229.7000000000003, No actually.
2229.7000000000003,2230.7000000000003, No actually.
2230.7000000000003,2233.7000000000003, I think the reason why we came up in the first place is because two
2233.7000000000003,2235.6600000000003, coasters of the year were awarded to cost of games.
2235.6600000000003,2236.6600000000003, Right.
2236.6600000000003,2237.6600000000003, I know.
2237.6600000000003,2238.6600000000003, I'll too.
2238.6600000000003,2240.1800000000003, I don't think that that works.
2240.1800000000003,2242.1800000000003, I want to call them like the dooses of the year or something.
2242.1800000000003,2246.9," Because coasters of the year, we have awards for hardware for specific music and"
2246.9,2247.7400000000002, games.
2247.7400000000002,2248.94, We have them for specific love.
2248.94,2249.94, Obviously.
2249.94,2251.54, So you can't call like a song a coaster or something.
2251.54,2253.1800000000003, Do you think anything could be a doose?
2253.1800000000003,2254.1800000000003, OK.
2254.1800000000003,2257.42, That's like some streetlingo word of your drop in doose.
2257.42,2258.42, Like doose.
2258.42,2259.42, Yeah.
2259.42,2260.62, You drop with a doose.
2260.62,2261.82, That's how the kids talk.
2261.82,2262.82, The doose.
2262.82,2263.82, OK.
2263.82,2266.06, So we don't want to do something.
2266.06,2267.06, I don't want one.
2267.06,2268.06, You don't want to do that.
2268.06,2268.7000000000003, OK.
2268.7000000000003,2269.3, So we yeah.
2269.3,2270.3, Yeah.
2270.3,2271.3, We do so.
2271.3,2272.3, We compiled the dooses of the year.
2272.3,2273.3, Well.
2273.3,2274.3, Well.
2274.38,2277.42, Like you snuck that in during the podcast not before.
2277.42,2278.42, Yeah.
2278.42,2279.42, Yeah.
2279.42,2281.9, There's like a play like hold that off until the last second.
2281.9,2282.9, Yeah.
2282.9,2284.9, So we don't.
2284.9,2285.9, The show.
2285.9,2286.9, So awards.
2286.9,2289.3, Back to you didn't make an overall doose of the year.
2289.3,2290.6200000000003, Grand doose of the year.
2290.6200000000003,2291.6200000000003, No.
2291.6200000000003,2292.6200000000003, We didn't really have one.
2292.6200000000003,2293.6200000000003, Which is like I guess is a good thing.
2293.6200000000003,2296.98, There was not one game in our collective brains to adapt.
2296.98,2297.98, It's just like an utter.
2297.98,2299.2200000000003, I think that that's a problem.
2299.2200000000003,2300.9, Because there's a couple of one.
2300.9,2302.3, Not enough of us all played it.
2302.3,2304.2200000000003," So like I mean, I heard so much about bad day."
2304.22,2305.22, I like it.
2305.22,2306.22," Say for example, all of us."
2306.22,2307.22, I'll be front candidate.
2307.22,2308.22, That reviewed it.
2308.22,2309.7799999999997, We're obligated to play and complete it.
2309.7799999999997,2311.22, We probably all hate it.
2311.22,2312.7799999999997," You know, probably all agree."
2312.7799999999997,2316.7799999999997, But I will say that in the past and we could change the criteria in the past and
2316.7799999999997,2317.7799999999997, computer gaming world.
2317.7799999999997,2321.54, The coaster of the year was always something because there were there are always
2321.54,2322.54, crappy games.
2322.54,2323.54, Right.
2323.54,2324.54, That's obvious piece of expected expected.
2324.54,2325.54, Right.
2325.54,2328.22, The coaster of the year ended up being something that we assumed was going to
2328.22,2329.22, be good.
2329.22,2331.7799999999997, And I don't know if any of us actually thought about bad day LA.
2331.7799999999997,2332.7799999999997, I'm sorry.
2332.7799999999997,2334.18, American McGee's bad day LA.
2334.18,2335.18," Yeah, make sure you say that."
2335.18,2336.18, American McGee presents.
2336.18,2337.18, But that's true.
2337.18,2338.18," Yeah, that's true."
2338.18,2339.18, So thank you.
2339.18,2341.02, It's a total of like why you keep putting your name on the game award or like why is
2341.02,2343.02, you still turning into a bad.
2343.02,2344.02, Yeah.
2344.02,2345.02, It all Hitler presents.
2345.02,2346.02, Okay.
2346.02,2347.02, Okay.
2347.02,2348.02, Okay.
2348.02,2349.02, Okay.
2349.02,2350.02, All right.
2350.02,2351.02, I'm sorry.
2351.02,2352.02, American maybe it's not that bad.
2352.02,2354.5, But still starting to be maybe a brand you don't quite want to be a
2354.5,2355.5, associated with.
2355.5,2358.8999999999996, Certain cashier that comes with a no.
2358.8999999999996,2360.2999999999997, You both presents.
2360.2999999999997,2361.2999999999997, Right.
2361.2999999999997,2363.2999999999997, So where are we going to be giving this?
2364.26,2365.26, I don't know.
2365.26,2369.6200000000003, Why don't we just let's let's so I don't hog the mic when we randomly
2369.6200000000003,2371.34, each jump in there and pass out the razzy.
2371.34,2372.34, I'm sorry.
2372.34,2373.34, Ducers.
2373.34,2374.34, Okay.
2374.34,2375.34, Fess of induces.
2375.34,2376.34, Pass the do see.
2376.34,2377.7400000000002, I have to say world of more craft.
2377.7400000000002,2378.7400000000002, Oh yeah.
2378.7400000000002,2379.7400000000002, Yeah.
2379.7400000000002,2380.7400000000002, That's right.
2380.7400000000002,2381.7400000000002, For what?
2381.7400000000002,2382.7400000000002, Yeah.
2382.7400000000002,2383.7400000000002, That's for 2006.
2383.7400000000002,2384.7400000000002, I didn't like it.
2384.7400000000002,2385.7400000000002, Just being confirmed.
2385.7400000000002,2386.7400000000002, Now 2006 it sucked.
2386.7400000000002,2387.7400000000002, Yeah.
2387.7400000000002,2389.34, Now it's great.
2389.34,2393.42, In 2006 you were a moron and now you're like on the bandwagon.
2393.42,2394.42, What the hell?
2394.42,2395.42, So maybe you should get the do's.
2395.42,2396.42, Maybe.
2396.42,2399.42, Ryan and Ducers are more of a year.
2399.42,2400.42, Okay.
2400.42,2404.5," In all seriousness, there's the most unfortunate game name which goes to bed."
2404.5,2405.5, I'm so sure.
2405.5,2406.5, That.
2406.5,2407.5," No, no, that's 2005."
2407.5,2408.5, Was that too close?
2408.5,2409.5, I don't care.
2409.5,2410.5, I just don't care.
2410.5,2411.5, That's a transcends time.
2411.5,2414.34, I thought we were going to say so important that we want to talk about it.
2414.34,2415.34, We can talk about it.
2415.34,2418.1000000000004, So now every bad game name is going to get the bed on soldier award.
2418.1000000000004,2419.1000000000004, Right.
2419.1,2421.1, And all of these are bed on soldier award.
2421.1,2422.1, You know what I mean?
2422.1,2426.3399999999997," It's like, I can, to this day, I don't even know what that means."
2426.3399999999997,2427.3399999999997, What?
2427.3399999999997,2428.3399999999997, Always been on soldier.
2428.3399999999997,2429.8199999999997, That's always been on soldier.
2429.8199999999997,2430.8199999999997, But is that what it is?
2430.8199999999997,2432.8199999999997, Is it a declarative?
2432.8199999999997,2433.8199999999997, Is it?
2433.8199999999997,2434.8199999999997," Is it a command, Jeff?"
2434.8199999999997,2435.8199999999997," Actually, kind of."
2435.8199999999997,2437.02, Is it am I the soldier?
2437.02,2438.02, Like bed on.
2438.02,2439.02," No, no."
2439.02,2440.02," No, no."
2440.02,2441.02, I bet on the soldier.
2441.02,2442.02, Is it touched?
2442.02,2443.02, I bet on actually not.
2443.02,2444.02, What it was.
2444.02,2447.38, It's a game name and a game descriptor.
2447.62,2450.1400000000003," Basically, that's, that's, you bet on soldier."
2450.1400000000003,2451.62, You bet on soldier's in a game.
2451.62,2452.62, Bet.
2452.62,2453.62, Really?
2453.62,2455.46," They have, like, if some more runs, I mean, like,"
2455.46,2456.78, sat on tailor.
2456.78,2458.78," Don't bet on tailor, bet on soldier."
2458.78,2459.78, Right.
2459.78,2462.26," I was like, oh, there's trouble in Panama."
2462.26,2463.1, How are you going to fix it?
2463.1,2464.62, Bet on soldier.
2464.62,2467.46, So it doesn't even matter what you're doing.
2467.46,2469.3, That did not come out 2005.
2469.3,2470.3, I don't exactly.
2470.3,2471.7000000000003, I thought it was like a derogative.
2471.7000000000003,2472.7000000000003, Maybe he may be a red.
2472.7000000000003,2473.7000000000003, I think he's fine.
2473.7000000000003,2474.7000000000003, Yeah.
2474.7000000000003,2475.7000000000003, That's shit.
2475.7000000000003,2476.7000000000003, We live on a single.
2476.7,2478.7799999999997," That stuff comes out every month, far as I'm concerned."
2478.7799999999997,2480.58, It wouldn't be a big more sense if it was plural.
2480.58,2481.9399999999996, And that bet on soldiers.
2481.9399999999996,2483.8999999999996," No, I mean, I mean, you were a little bit of a"
2483.8999999999996,2485.7," actually, if you heard of soldier."
2485.7,2487.98," Actually, if you heard all the broken English in the final game,"
2487.98,2488.7, it would make total sense.
2488.7,2490.1, It would make total sense.
2490.1,2491.8599999999997," I thought it was a decoder if, like, you know,"
2491.8599999999997,2494.2999999999997," like I'm gambling in Vegas and so I'm a standing behind me going,"
2494.2999999999997,2495.9399999999996, bet on soldier.
2495.9399999999996,2496.9399999999996," That's not, that's not."
2496.9399999999996,2498.7799999999997," You know what, maybe it is that way, but they don't."
2498.7799999999997,2501.2999999999997," Well, this part of why it's winning our award."
2501.2999999999997,2502.02, Because we don't get it.
2502.02,2503.02, Because we don't know.
2503.02,2505.3799999999997, I spent an entire year going around doing what I did to you
2505.38,2507.9, with a che who used to work here who's now
2507.9,2508.94, who works with Microsoft.
2508.94,2509.3, Yeah.
2509.3,2510.9," And anytime we'd see each other, we'd just be like,"
2510.9,2512.06," che, che, what's up?"
2512.06,2513.06," Oh, like, what's up?"
2513.06,2514.06, Bet on soldier.
2514.06,2515.7400000000002, We just any time randomly for you.
2515.7400000000002,2517.1800000000003," We're just going always, always."
2517.1800000000003,2519.98," Okay, so next I want to add, yeah."
2519.98,2523.02, We got a doose for the shitty assales pitch.
2523.02,2526.98, And this would be the Call of R is Walter Player demo.
2526.98,2529.82, The game has not officially been published here yet in the United
2529.82,2530.34, States.
2530.34,2531.62," It's going to be out in June, I think."
2531.62,2532.1400000000003, It's going to June.
2532.14,2537.7, But it's been out in your opinion since last fall or whatever.
2537.7,2538.22, Right.
2538.22,2540.3399999999997, But the reason that there's a shitty sales pitch is not
2540.3399999999997,2541.7, so much that the game is bad.
2541.7,2544.3799999999997," I mean, and it's got some ridiculous stuff."
2544.3799999999997,2547.06," I mean, it's basically just Wild West Counter Strike with the"
2547.06,2548.06, worst melee ever.
2548.06,2549.1, It's like this boot.
2549.1,2551.3399999999997," So it's supposed to be like a boot up the ass, but look down"
2551.3399999999997,2552.66, at yourself kicking.
2552.66,2554.3799999999997," And it's like, it barely goes above a knee."
2554.3799999999997,2556.06," He's like, he's like, so you're going to melee."
2556.06,2557.2599999999998, And it does like 10 damage.
2557.2599999999998,2558.74, And you don't think I got 100 damage.
2558.74,2560.3799999999997, So you just keep kicking people.
2560.7000000000003,2562.46," Oh, check that."
2562.46,2565.5, But so there were hackers in the game.
2565.5,2567.6600000000003," Not only that there were exploits in the maps, you can get"
2567.6600000000003,2571.7000000000003," outside of the maps, but there were straight up like hacks all"
2571.7000000000003,2572.3, over.
2572.3,2574.5, And the game hadn't even come out yet.
2574.5,2575.34, It was just a demo.
2575.34,2578.78," So it's like, OK, like, how re-assuring is it that you're going to buy?"
2578.78,2580.5, I can't wait to buy this game.
2580.5,2582.02, I get hacked on for free.
2582.02,2583.7400000000002, I can't wait to pay to get hacked on.
2583.7400000000002,2585.2200000000003, And the hacks were just hilarious.
2585.2200000000003,2588.02," It was like you could moon jumping, but you'd go like 80 feet"
2588.02,2591.74," a year, just like, you know, turning no clip on."
2591.74,2593.94, So you just go into buildings or drop underneath the map
2593.94,2596.5, and shoot everyone from underneath the map.
2596.5,2600.1," There's absolutely no, there's no punishment for team killing."
2600.1,2602.54," So as soon as you go in there, it's like everyone's just like,"
2602.54,2603.2599999999998, just turn on the shot.
2603.2599999999998,2604.14, They're really just the wild one.
2604.14,2605.14, What another.
2605.14,2608.14," And like, it totally is the wild one."
2608.14,2609.14," OK, it's all good."
2609.14,2611.14," And it's a feature on the box, man."
2611.14,2613.46," It's kind of the day of our good, like, well, that we were going"
2613.46,2615.82, to enable all that in the actual game.
2615.82,2616.82, I don't know.
2616.82,2618.3, But you know what the thing is.
2618.3,2620.3, But it's actually point you brought it up.
2620.3,2623.06," And I was thinking, how many games come out in Europe first?"
2623.06,2626.38," And like, the North American published, say, oh, this is so bust"
2626.38,2627.7400000000002, and we can't release it yet.
2627.7400000000002,2628.02, Right.
2628.02,2629.78, Like Gothic 3 is the same deal.
2629.78,2631.54," Yeah, that is interesting."
2631.54,2632.46, And I wonder what the deal is.
2632.46,2634.26, I think more the delay it has to do.
2634.26,2635.82, I doubt they're doing anything to the game.
2635.82,2638.78, I think it has to do with just like quarters and revenues
2638.78,2642.3, and based on what their product line is and each region
2642.3,2643.5, for a certain quarter.
2643.5,2645.1400000000003, But there are so many more games that are busts.
2645.14,2646.14, Let me come on.
2646.14,2649.18," Like there's no, if they drop that game here in the holiday season."
2649.18,2650.18," Oh, we have huge mess."
2650.18,2651.18," Yeah, exactly."
2651.18,2652.18," No, we would have to spend invisible."
2652.18,2653.5," No, but it's seriously."
2653.5,2655.7799999999997," There are so many games that like, they'll come out with a billion"
2655.7799999999997,2658.98, patches in the EU before it'll ever come out here in the States.
2658.98,2662.3799999999997, Do we have a lower tolerance for patches than the Europeans do?
2662.3799999999997,2663.18, That's seemingly so.
2663.18,2664.18, Apparently.
2664.18,2666.8199999999997," Well, last next week when we bring on the French people."
2666.8199999999997,2667.8199999999997, Everybody.
2667.8199999999997,2668.8199999999997, For our epic.
2668.8199999999997,2669.8199999999997, I think it catches in French.
2669.8199999999997,2670.8199999999997, All of it.
2670.8199999999997,2671.8199999999997, That is.
2671.8199999999997,2672.8199999999997, Call of futches.
2672.8199999999997,2673.8199999999997, That's here.
2673.86,2674.82, Another word.
2674.82,2677.1000000000004," Ryan, I think Ryan wants to hand out an award."
2677.1000000000004,2678.98, Biggest cluster of fuck of the year.
2678.98,2680.98," Oh, he's got to wait and this one out."
2680.98,2681.98," Oh, man."
2681.98,2685.6600000000003, I keep handing this one out whenever anybody gives me a chance to talk about it.
2685.6600000000003,2686.6600000000003, Hand it out again.
2686.6600000000003,2690.06, It goes to the Sierra collections that the Vindi games release.
2690.06,2691.06, Yeah.
2691.06,2696.98," Which as many of you already know are the compilations of the Kingsquass space quests,"
2696.98,2700.86," police quests and leadership series, the event room series."
2700.86,2704.54, All put together in really crappy packages for a full-open.
2704.54,2706.1400000000003," 1990, 90, 90 piece."
2706.1400000000003,2709.1400000000003, Here you've got some of the best.
2709.1400000000003,2710.1400000000003, I was going to say it.
2710.1400000000003,2711.1400000000003, Best game ever.
2711.1400000000003,2714.1400000000003, Game of all time on the PC.
2714.1400000000003,2715.1400000000003, Fans.
2715.1400000000003,2716.58, That's the one that you're not new talking.
2716.58,2717.58, That is.
2717.58,2719.58, I love the Richard Notton.
2719.58,2720.94, But it's true.
2720.94,2724.82, And fans have been clamoring for their re-releases forever.
2724.82,2727.2200000000003, Sierra brags about Vindi.
2727.2200000000003,2728.2200000000003, Sorry.
2728.2200000000003,2729.54, Brags about how they're going to bring them back.
2729.54,2734.62," And then when they do, these are like sub-warm art releases."
2734.62,2735.62, What they did here.
2735.62,2739.34," I mean, they so could have done like a criterion of a version with interviews from the"
2739.34,2740.34, team.
2740.34,2741.34, This is what we were saying at the time.
2741.34,2742.34, Correct.
2742.34,2743.34, Yeah.
2743.34,2744.34," If anything, I'm curious."
2744.34,2747.22, A criterion style DVD release.
2747.22,2748.66, It was these games.
2748.66,2754.2599999999998," Because while claiming that they brought these back, they're like thinking about reviving"
2754.2599999999998,2755.2599999999998, these series or whatever.
2755.2599999999998,2756.74, And they wanted to do them justice.
2756.74,2759.7, The lack of respect shown to these releases.
2759.7,2761.14," To me, it was just a poly."
2761.14,2763.18, I'm ranting where you should be right.
2763.18,2764.18, I'm sorry.
2764.18,2765.18, But I couldn't believe it.
2765.18,2766.18, I don't know.
2766.18,2768.18," I mean, we agree that like it's not a lot of a car."
2768.18,2769.8199999999997, No manual.
2769.8199999999997,2773.3799999999997, It was like one of those comes in a cardboard box with like one fricking.
2773.3799999999997,2777.14, The piece of paper says like the manual PDFs are on the disc.
2777.14,2778.8199999999997, You might want to print them out.
2778.8199999999997,2779.8199999999997, Yeah.
2779.8199999999997,2782.74, Richard Notton's sludge and the Zelda duo record was released in nothing less than
2782.74,2784.06, the gold cartridge.
2784.06,2786.2599999999998," You know, we released that."
2786.26,2789.34, The traditional form only on the virtual console.
2789.34,2793.26," You're mocking, but it's true, though, especially because some of these games kind"
2793.26,2796.9," of required the print manual, just to proceed."
2796.9,2800.86, Some gold are stuck on the stuff on there that you needed.
2800.86,2803.5," I, yeah, just utterly disappointing."
2803.5,2805.82, I thought it can't even be funny about it.
2805.82,2807.0200000000004, Those things are to make me mad.
2807.0200000000004,2808.0200000000004, And then they did that.
2808.0200000000004,2811.34," And the point of the, and then like, I really do hope they come back to those series."
2811.34,2813.34, I want to see a brand new space question.
2813.34,2816.1800000000003, What I've heard was that they were going to use the performance of the
2816.74,2817.4199999999996, games.
2817.4199999999996,2818.4199999999996, The game.
2818.4199999999996,2819.8199999999997, The game is to engage people's interests.
2819.8199999999997,2820.1, Yeah.
2820.1,2821.1, Yes.
2821.1,2822.1," It's like, yeah, well, what?"
2822.1,2823.7," You just, these are there like a bit you're."
2823.7,2825.98," Yeah, wait a mile up some happy, you know what?"
2825.98,2826.98, It's enthusiastic.
2826.98,2829.58," If they want to engage enthusiasm, look at how people are clamoring to get a graphic"
2829.58,2830.98, adventure on a DS right now.
2830.98,2833.8999999999996," I mean, like people are starving for good and good graphic adventures wherever they"
2833.8999999999996,2834.8999999999996, can go.
2834.8999999999996,2835.8999999999996, I'll dust FTW.
2835.8999999999996,2836.8999999999996, I don't know.
2836.8999999999996,2838.8999999999996, Tell us and Phoenix right.
2838.8999999999996,2839.8999999999996," Very, very good graphic."
2839.8999999999996,2841.54, But that's exactly my point.
2841.54,2844.06," Like, you know, that's graphic, that's graphic adventures for a new generation."
2844.06,2845.98, People are dying to get those things.
2845.98,2846.62, Yeah.
2846.62,2847.74, You can't find them in stores.
2847.74,2851.22, I would say if that's the treatment that they're going to give the franchises like
2851.22,2853.42," that, please don't bring them back then."
2853.42,2854.42, Just let them die.
2854.42,2855.42, Look at that.
2855.42,2856.42, Just have a happy memory.
2856.42,2857.42, You probably can't bring up.
2857.42,2859.86, There's a really good story associated with this whole thing.
2859.86,2860.86," No, no."
2860.86,2863.1, It's based on the same one thing.
2863.1,2865.86, Someone wanted to ring Ryan's neck the last time we talked about it.
2865.86,2866.86," Oh, yeah."
2866.86,2867.86," Well, now they're going to want to ring mine now."
2867.86,2868.86, That was me.
2868.86,2869.86, That was me.
2869.86,2870.86," Sorry, Brian."
2870.86,2871.86, Yeah.
2871.86,2872.86, I love you.
2872.86,2874.2200000000003," Lastly, you're so Larry, they released."
2874.2200000000003,2876.78," You know, I mean, that was horrible, too."
2876.78,2877.78, Yeah.
2877.78,2881.1400000000003, I say let these games rest in peace now.
2881.1400000000003,2883.6600000000003, Unless they can come back and shut us up with a great game.
2883.6600000000003,2885.82," And the other thing, well, we're on the subject of which I see a."
2885.82,2886.82, I don't know.
2886.82,2887.82," See, I know."
2887.82,2889.3, I'm just a.
2889.3,2893.1800000000003, The Vindi seems to be trying to kind of like.
2893.1800000000003,2894.82, Use the Sierra name again.
2894.82,2899.2200000000003," Like, they're starting to use the name Vindi less for their game division."
2899.2200000000003,2900.78, And I think they made the shift over fully.
2900.78,2901.78, Right.
2902.42,2904.6200000000003," No, they can't do that."
2904.6200000000003,2905.42, Why?
2905.42,2906.42, That's not right.
2906.42,2907.38, I think they can't.
2907.38,2908.02, Yes.
2908.02,2910.42, I'm saying they can't.
2910.42,2911.42, Why?
2911.42,2912.6200000000003, They've done enough damage to the game.
2912.6200000000003,2913.82, Just why.
2913.82,2915.78, Ryan's drawing his land on the sand.
2915.78,2917.26, They've done enough damage to that name.
2917.26,2918.86, They just need to be Vindi.
2918.86,2921.5400000000004, It's like when S&K became S&K play more.
2921.5400000000004,2922.5400000000004, Exactly.
2922.5400000000004,2924.1400000000003, That's super.
2924.1400000000003,2927.6200000000003, I was very upset when I couldn't play.
2927.6200000000003,2930.9," You move the production house at a country, at a Japan."
2930.98,2932.38, It is no longer S&K's.
2932.38,2934.1, It's not a concern.
2934.1,2934.58, Same right.
2934.58,2935.54, Should we go with S&K?
2935.54,2936.54," No, it's not."
2936.54,2937.54, It is no longer S&K.
2937.54,2938.82, It is VU games.
2938.82,2940.58," And if we're a challenge, call it."
2940.58,2942.1800000000003, Gick.
2942.1800000000003,2943.5, OK.
2943.5,2944.7000000000003, I'll pass one out.
2944.7000000000003,2948.38," I think we talked about this in a previous podcast or 10, too,"
2948.38,2950.5, which is a most defensive intro.
2950.5,2951.5," Oh, yeah."
2951.5,2952.7000000000003, We did.
2952.7000000000003,2953.3, This is what he did.
2953.3,2955.46, Which goes to the chief Wahoo.
2956.38,2962.58, T.P. Fest that was the two minutes of the play of the play intro.
2962.58,2965.3, The play make our top 10 of the year.
2965.3,2967.94," It did for, no."
2967.94,2969.54," It was like, it was the shot."
2969.54,2971.54, Especially for level design.
2971.54,2973.2200000000003," OK, I actually loved play."
2973.2200000000003,2974.38, I did have fun playing.
2974.38,2975.54, I loved that game.
2975.54,2979.06," But that intro, you really had to get paths that intro."
2979.06,2980.02," And we're not talking about,"
2980.02,2983.94, was it the fire water drinking grandpa or is it the gambling?
2983.94,2986.5, It wasn't the beating people drunk in the end of the race.
2986.5,2987.5, It was worse.
2987.5,2988.5, Yeah.
2988.5,2990.1," And it wasn't because a lot of people, when I say that,"
2990.1,2991.38," they're like, well, that was really cool."
2991.38,2993.54, When you get the spaceship show up and don't
2993.54,2995.54, free the reapers play and that part was awesome.
2995.54,2996.26, That's cool.
2996.26,2997.2200000000003, I love that.
2997.2200000000003,2999.34, But it's the minute it's before that that it terrible.
2999.34,3000.7400000000002, The people move after that.
3000.7400000000002,3001.82, That was for that was you.
3001.82,3003.58," That's the, it's a small world to death."
3003.58,3004.58, That was like that.
3004.58,3007.2200000000003," So you go, you move or that's the minute."
3007.2200000000003,3008.58, Did you do do do?
3008.58,3009.06, Yeah.
3009.06,3010.34, Then you go through the whole people move and get
3010.34,3011.82, spiked to the second sight.
3011.82,3014.2200000000003," And maybe, you know, like they had been working on that"
3014.2200000000003,3016.7000000000003," sparkly care for five years, but like the fact"
3016.7000000000003,3018.54, that matters that a million other games had it.
3018.54,3021.1800000000003, And then those recently quake four with its
3021.1800000000003,3023.7400000000002, stratification scene that it revealed and actually
3023.7400000000002,3024.78, the struck the case of Russell.
3024.78,3025.82, So I'm a cooler.
3025.82,3028.3, So maybe they didn't know what to do once you got to the end
3028.3,3028.7000000000003, of it.
3028.7000000000003,3030.6600000000003, You just care about so that it was a f**k it.
3030.6600000000003,3031.3, Let's kill him.
3031.3,3035.5," To me, it was like, it was a, we had this all elaborate"
3035.5,3037.1400000000003, sci-fi thing going on to them.
3037.1400000000003,3038.38, We ran out of money.
3038.38,3041.26, Maybe we'll stitch one of them to a monster of the
3041.26,3042.26, monster.
3042.26,3043.26," Yeah, right."
3043.26,3044.26, I'm going to fight it.
3044.26,3045.26," But aliens, like they're so sophisticated, but they always"
3045.26,3047.26, have to have a group goldberg device to fuck.
3047.26,3048.26," Yeah, well, it was a cop."
3048.26,3050.26, I was the thing you were saying in the podcast back then.
3050.26,3052.26," I was like, it was like, it was like an Auschwitz log flu."
3052.26,3053.26," You're like, you know what?"
3053.26,3054.26, I think if you're not.
3054.26,3055.26, That's a second Nazi joke.
3055.26,3056.26, You get to the very ending.
3056.26,3058.26, You sit there like you look up something happens.
3058.26,3059.26, Then it's all over.
3059.26,3060.26, That was.
3060.26,3061.26," Hey, yay."
3061.26,3062.26, We're here.
3062.26,3063.26, Oh.
3063.26,3064.26, So now we've killed that.
3064.26,3065.26, Yeah.
3065.26,3066.26, I wanted to come back to it quick.
3066.26,3067.26, I always thought that a mission.
3067.26,3068.26, I want to give the dumbest mission.
3068.26,3070.26, I'm sure like dumber missions existed in a year.
3070.26,3073.26, Just a little bit of a particular memorable for me.
3073.26,3078.26, Just called Mingo's Marauders and basically you run into this guy out in the middle
3078.26,3079.26, of nowhere.
3079.26,3082.26, He's just standing in the wastelands like all the other like guys that give you
3082.26,3083.26, missions.
3083.26,3084.26, And you talk to him.
3084.26,3085.26, He's got a fistful of a clink for you.
3085.26,3087.26, He's got a fistful of a gun.
3087.26,3088.26, I've heard that.
3088.26,3091.26, So they're these guys in this canyon.
3091.26,3094.26," And they, you know, they are up to no good."
3094.26,3096.26, I need you to go and exterminate these fools.
3096.26,3097.26, So you go and do it.
3097.26,3098.26, And it's like you get there.
3098.26,3101.26, And it's like just all these dudes walking around about your crates.
3101.26,3103.26, Just crates stacked everywhere.
3103.26,3105.26, Like what's up with these guys?
3105.26,3106.26, I don't really see what the harm is.
3106.26,3111.26," So sure enough, whatever I turn on the flamethrowers and the napaam and the bombs and blow"
3111.26,3114.26," them up and I go back and they're like, I just like collect my body for."
3114.26,3116.26, But then it's like you go back again.
3116.26,3117.26, Someone else needs that mission done.
3117.26,3119.26," So I say, all right, I'll go help you."
3119.26,3121.26, And when you go back and the same fools are back there.
3121.26,3122.26, They set up their boxes again.
3122.26,3123.26, I'm going to blew them all up.
3123.26,3124.26, So basically it's up to back there.
3124.26,3128.26," They're back there building, but this is like a bunch of peaceful crates stackers."
3128.26,3130.26, They want you to like exterminate them off.
3130.26,3133.26," But when you get back there, does he explain why you dig what you did?"
3133.26,3134.26," No, he doesn't need to give a shit."
3134.26,3136.26," He just like, like, here's a link."
3136.26,3138.26, Like the only way to just a link.
3138.26,3140.26, The fools are stacking crates.
3140.26,3141.26, You got work to do.
3141.26,3143.26, But that's all there is to it.
3143.26,3146.26," So basically, it's not that to bring up yet another version of it."
3146.26,3148.26, But it's like a master solution for some Hooverville.
3148.26,3150.26," And yeah, that's what it basically was."
3151.26,3155.26, But it reminded me in jump up tracks here into console land.
3155.26,3161.26," And in gear's a war for 360, like the one time you see the locus doing anything."
3161.26,3165.26, Like you get this little clip of them and they're carrying crates too and pipes.
3165.26,3169.26," It's like, who wise everyone is like, I want to know what makes you guys tick."
3169.26,3173.26," I mean, it's like, I don't need to read the literature like the internet canyon."
3173.26,3176.26," Like talk praising the great crate, whatever that found it."
3176.26,3177.26, They're supposed to be talking.
3177.26,3178.26, That's what you're talking about.
3178.26,3179.26, That's what you're talking about.
3179.26,3181.26, Same way in gear's a war.
3181.26,3182.26, That's all right.
3182.26,3183.26, All right.
3183.26,3184.26, Do we have any more to pass out?
3184.26,3188.26," We have a big one that we haven't talked about yet, which is a scrap."
3188.26,3189.26," Yeah, I was really business with."
3189.26,3190.26," Oh, we're done."
3190.26,3193.26," So actually, you know, originally people were in the office."
3193.26,3195.26, We're thinking there's going to be some kind of great debate.
3195.26,3197.26, And Sean has a good point and you want to see.
3197.26,3198.26, You're back and off the debate.
3198.26,3201.26," No, I was like, well, the Willie was no debate in the first place."
3201.26,3203.26," I mean, I was selling like the debate."
3203.26,3204.26," That was a, I heard it in fight on the right."
3204.26,3206.26, I don't know if they don't really do.
3206.26,3208.26," Okay, well, well, actually, I wasn't yelling."
3208.26,3209.26, I was.
3209.26,3210.26, It was out.
3210.26,3212.26, We had physics down to fill people.
3212.26,3213.26, We had physics card.
3213.26,3214.26, The GS physics card down.
3214.26,3216.26, And we also had killers and I see.
3216.26,3218.26, And then never came to face card.
3218.26,3219.26, There were interface card.
3219.26,3222.26," And you were, you dare and you were saying it should be the network interface card."
3222.26,3225.26, And I was saying it should be the physics card.
3225.26,3226.26, And then you.
3226.26,3228.26," Well, the worst piece of hardware of the year."
3228.26,3229.26, Yeah.
3229.26,3230.26, Yeah.
3230.26,3231.26," Well, the thing was, okay."
3231.26,3233.26, So my logic was the killer card outright bored computers.
3233.26,3237.26, It actually crashed my system multiple times and I didn't see any valuable use come out of it.
3237.26,3238.26, That's bad.
3238.26,3240.26, That amounts to pretty bad on my kid.
3240.26,3241.26," In my book, that's bad."
3241.26,3243.26," I mean, the fact that I would actually try to shut down a computer."
3243.26,3244.26, I get blue screens of death.
3244.26,3246.26, This is going to be Windows vista next year.
3246.26,3248.26, But I'm just going to keep rubbing that.
3248.26,3249.26," No, no, I just."
3249.26,3250.26, So I get fired.
3250.26,3251.26, Right.
3251.26,3255.26," And Sean, Sean brought up a really valid point that's out there right now that basically"
3255.26,3259.26," Will court to, uh, quad, you know, the news in cell CPUs,"
3259.26,3263.26," well, that kind of remove any need for a physics, you know, for a hardware solution for physics."
3263.26,3267.26," That's the big question right now because, um,"
3267.26,3269.26," Well, it's, it's twofold."
3269.26,3273.26," Uh, the, like, one, one answer I, I was thinking when I first thought of this all was,"
3273.26,3277.26," Okay, trying to say that physics did not perform in its first year's true because there are no games that actually,"
3277.26,3279.26," They're all like, like, strap on applications."
3279.26,3282.26," Just like little, it's like you watch a movie and they have like one laser bolt."
3282.26,3284.26," And then you flip a switch and oh, there's five more laser bolts."
3284.26,3285.26, Big freaking deal.
3285.26,3286.26, And how much is this card?
3286.26,3288.26, 200 something bucks.
3288.26,3289.26, Okay.
3289.26,3292.26," So, but the thing is if you use that same logic, you, you, you, three, three,"
3292.26,3295.26, three cards sucked in the first year and now they're pretty much invaluable.
3295.26,3296.26, Right.
3296.26,3299.26," So, you're, so, but here's my, here's my side now."
3299.26,3300.26, Right.
3300.26,3304.26, I was assuming that no one in the right mind bought the killer card.
3304.26,3305.26," Like, you do, what is it?"
3305.26,3307.26," Like who even knows what it is, right?"
3307.26,3310.26," Well, well, the same time the physics card is a sexier,"
3310.26,3314.26, A candidate to me because I think people were probably interested in it because
3315.26,3320.26," We, we're at this crossroads where like clearly we need to solve physics issues in some way, shape or form."
3320.26,3324.26, And this is one very seemingly very viable solution to it.
3324.26,3327.26," However, for the year that the card came out,"
3327.26,3330.26, I don't remember doing like Jack shit with it.
3330.26,3333.26," You know, I mean, like it had ghost recon events, warfighter supported it."
3333.26,3336.26, But the reports were that it did absolutely nothing to the game plan.
3336.26,3339.26," People playing it actually thought that it had the game performed a little like,"
3339.26,3342.26," Yeah, that was, um, and then there was, you know, Robo Blitz,"
3342.26,3343.26, which came out and stuff.
3343.26,3346.26," But at the end of the day, I mean, the whole like the argument about, you know,"
3346.26,3350.26," Well, if we rip video cards in the same way, then whatever, but it's like,"
3350.26,3354.26," I want to take us back to like before I worked for the magazine,"
3354.26,3356.26," uh, you know, as computer gaming world,"
3356.26,3359.26," they gave an infamous award to something called Steam,"
3359.26,3361.26, and it was the coaster of the year award.
3361.26,3362.26, Yep.
3362.26,3367.26," And steam as we know, it's pretty damn good, you know?"
3367.26,3371.26," I just think it like now, almost now I was changing computers and the break and I love it because"
3371.26,3373.26," it's like, oh, yeah, put a new operating system on there."
3373.26,3375.26," I don't give a shit if anything goes wrong,"
3375.26,3377.26," I just open up steam and hit, yes, down right."
3377.26,3378.26, I'm all again.
3378.26,3379.26, Right.
3379.26,3382.26," But so anyway, a point, you did it to steam and that took balls in the same year."
3382.26,3383.26," You're like, you know what,"
3383.26,3385.26," paint killers, the FPS of the year,"
3385.26,3387.26," and head and the web in the paint killers,"
3387.26,3389.26, hell of a lot better than the gravity gun.
3389.26,3392.26," God knows it's, it's better than the, uh, than the, uh,"
3392.26,3394.26, the fair moon bug bait.
3394.26,3397.26," I mean, those things are all right, but they're no, they're no paint killer."
3397.26,3400.26," I mean, so like to go back to that, I mean,"
3400.26,3401.26, that's what my mind is about.
3401.26,3404.26," But I would be filibustered on that, but I hope you're not, I mean, but I actually,"
3404.26,3408.26, I still think to this day that that steam or was totally justified.
3408.26,3410.26," Right. And I mean, that's how you get it."
3410.26,3414.26," Because you can always come around the next year you can turn around and be like,"
3414.26,3416.26," hey, we have to admit, we sucked last year."
3416.26,3420.26, Anyone who bought our card did not get $200 worth of value for us.
3420.26,3421.26," Then a new year comes, right?"
3421.26,3423.26," All of a sudden it's like, hey, guess what?"
3423.26,3427.26," Um, you know, crisis is like 10 times better when you've got this card,"
3428.26,3430.26," uh, like, brother's norm's hell's highway."
3430.26,3433.26," Whatever, like, all the physics and tents of games, you know, are like, uh,"
3433.26,3438.26," you know, relics next RTS or whatever, just hype off to my authorizing things that we use physics."
3438.26,3439.26, Right.
3439.26,3442.26," Then you're like, you come around that next year and you're like, hey, you know what?"
3442.26,3444.26," Like, this is such a turnaround for them."
3444.26,3445.26, They were a coaster of the year last year.
3445.26,3447.26," Uh, or there are scram we did that was a deal."
3447.26,3450.26," No, we have a parent said, you know what?"
3450.26,3451.26, Now it rules.
3451.26,3452.26, Right.
3452.26,3453.26, And we did those things.
3453.26,3454.26, Yeah.
3454.26,3457.26, And we just just because things could change.
3457.26,3459.26, Does it mean you can ever rule something out for the award?
3459.26,3462.26," Because I mean, the magazine's tradition, that's just how it worked."
3462.26,3463.26, Right.
3463.26,3466.26," Well, I think the, I think the, I think the, my knee jerk reaction was I thought"
3466.26,3471.26," Killer, the killer card was a worse product because it actually screwed up a computer."
3471.26,3474.26," Uh, with with with the, with the physics card at first it was kind of, it was kind of"
3474.26,3477.26," sluggish, but with time, it basically they improve the drivers."
3477.26,3480.26," But yeah, I was just saying it should at least consider it as a contender."
3481.26,3483.26," Uh, no, no, no, no. I totally, I totally should."
3483.26,3486.26," And I'm just going to say like, I would give it a miscensionity for for a"
3486.26,3488.26, coaster of the year and then like next year.
3488.26,3491.26, It could be a prime candidate for being a total piece of crap if it doesn't deliver.
3491.26,3493.26," Cause this, this year is really the make or break year for it."
3493.26,3496.26, If they don't deliver something really good and exclusive game.
3496.26,3500.26," That's, that's really the problem is they need to make a game that shows off exactly"
3500.26,3501.26, what the physics card can do.
3501.26,3503.26," But if I just thought, why is it that way?"
3503.26,3507.26," Why wouldn't just all, like if it was so good, wouldn't all the developers be like,"
3507.26,3510.26, our audience has just have to get this thing because this makes developing.
3510.26,3513.26, And this makes the product that we can deliver so much better.
3513.26,3516.26, And it's such a good solution for us that we're going to basically in the same way
3516.26,3519.26," that happened with 3D cards say, hey, audience, you want to play our game."
3519.26,3522.26, You need to go buy this thing instead of instead of them say the first.
3522.26,3526.26," Hey, we got this rad game called duck hunt and it makes our light guns so rad."
3526.26,3528.26," No, no, no, no, no, no."
3528.26,3530.26," I don't just say, like the thing is the first two games that actually sold."
3530.26,3533.26," Light graphics cards are all about Tomb Raider, Quake."
3533.26,3535.26, They had software render versions.
3535.26,3536.26, So basically they did a both.
3536.26,3537.26," Yeah, exactly."
3537.26,3541.26," So I mean, like you have to have a game that can like really get transition game and a lot of"
3541.26,3545.26," a bit, basically the Unreal 3 engine has physics in it."
3545.26,3548.26," So technically it's just going to like will you will you, you,"
3548.26,3551.26, Unreal tournament 3 really show off what physics can do.
3551.26,3556.26," So they'll have, they'll have Unreal tournament 3 will have a mode where you click and if you have that hardware,"
3556.26,3557.26, it's going to.
3557.26,3558.26, Exactly.
3558.26,3561.26, I wasn't aware of that because the last time I remember it was at last GDC and I took the Mark Raine.
3561.26,3564.26," They were saying that asked him about that and he was like, well,"
3564.26,3568.26, it doesn't like we're so happy with the way that the physics just work on their own in the game.
3568.26,3569.26, We don't need you.
3569.26,3574.26, They had that big physics demo and they had like a gravitational field and it sucked in about 60 objects.
3574.26,3575.26, Right.
3575.26,3576.26, And that was all without.
3576.26,3580.26, And when I talked to Mark Raine for our GFW interview a few issues back or maybe I still see
3580.26,3581.26, GW at the time.
3581.26,3584.26," But anyhow when I talked to him then he was saying how it actually does and you know,"
3584.26,3587.26," you can see a lot more happen in the game, but it'll be in a single player version,"
3587.26,3588.26, not multiplayer.
3588.26,3591.26," But you know, again, it's, it's a matter of like,"
3591.26,3595.26, there need to be some big games to show off what it can really do otherwise.
3595.26,3597.26," I still think I just, I purchased this thing."
3597.26,3600.26," I think I would be, I would be, no, I'm not arguing."
3600.26,3603.26, But it hasn't broken my computer is what I'm saying.
3603.26,3605.26, So that's why I'm given it.
3605.26,3606.26," That's why I'm given it a, you're on, I'm giving it."
3606.26,3610.26, I'm putting a G on this benefit of the doubt status benefit of the doubt status.
3610.26,3612.26," And I think it's like, I thought I was going crazy."
3612.26,3613.26," I actually, I quadruple checked."
3613.26,3615.26, I actually called Intel and I checked.
3615.26,3617.26, I was chatting with Lloyd and Jason about it.
3617.26,3619.26, We're all kind of on the same page.
3619.26,3625.26, Right now it's up to the guys who make the games to take advantage of either quad core using physics or a G.
3625.26,3632.26," Either way, but it seems like quad core is, is the one, the no brainer that everyone's going to have in their quad core."
3632.26,3633.26," So I'm pointing out, I agree."
3633.26,3643.26," Who knows how many people are going to end up with physics and that's why I'm saying a G has to come up with some kind of killer thing right now to kind of say, oh shit, I have to get this card."
3643.26,3646.26," I mean, they're, they're offering up a self-actor."
3646.26,3647.26, I'm coming out.
3647.26,3651.26," I look pretty hot when I saw a GDC last year and uh, warm on."
3651.26,3657.26," But again, I mean, I just, I just, I just, people talking right now is supposed to see what's, you know, when it's coming out or whatever."
3657.26,3661.26," So, but in terms of 2006, could it affect killer?"
3661.26,3666.26, I have no problem saying that I think screw up my computer in more ways I can count.
3666.26,3672.26," I actually, I was back to the whole, like, when we were talking about what would be the coaster of the year,"
3672.26,3677.26," like, I mean, I had a delay or, or no, we go something that's a little higher because we all expected that to be crap."
3677.26,3678.26," So it's like, it's good."
3678.26,3679.26, It's fine.
3679.26,3683.26," Something that we all like, we're hoping was going to be a dark messiah was one of them."
3683.26,3684.26, Right.
3684.26,3685.26, We put that on.
3685.26,3694.26," So I was just the same principles that of like, okay, well, that's how things operate then like I can't imagine anyone in the right mind saying, this networking card is going to give me 17.5%"
3694.26,3695.26, That no bit.
3696.26,3699.26," No, but actually, it's actually not a matter of that."
3699.26,3705.26," It's not only, I mean, I can get into the boring shit, but the idea was it was supposed to be able to prioritize packet data."
3705.26,3710.26, So you could actually download shit in the background while you're playing a game online.
3710.26,3712.26," Can't we already, all to be aware, it's not a good idea."
3712.26,3717.26, You can play world of warcraft for ripping off albums that haven't been released yet.
3717.26,3720.26," And you know what the funny thing is, you should be saying that in your own voice."
3721.26,3722.26, What?
3722.26,3724.26," I used to call on you out, buddy."
3724.26,3727.26, That was the fight.
3727.26,3728.26, Yeah.
3728.26,3730.26, That was good fun on Friday.
3730.26,3733.26, That was a lot of an example today.
3733.26,3735.26, A lot more simple because we're on air.
3735.26,3736.26, That's right.
3736.26,3737.26," Well, I got no idea."
3737.26,3738.26," Oh, fair. It's like fucking ass."
3738.26,3739.26, It was like an email discussion.
3739.26,3741.26, I was sitting there and gave charge in the door.
3741.26,3743.26," Oh, no, I think it was I didn't want to talk to him."
3743.26,3746.26," Damn it, that card is worth your money."
3747.26,3748.26, That's like that.
3748.26,3750.26," No, actually, I just stood out the door and I said,"
3750.26,3754.26," Well, I didn't want to get too deep into it because I just was like doing a billion things at once."
3754.26,3760.26," But the whole point I had back then, and it was just trying to say that it's too soon to call it dead."
3760.26,3763.26," Oh, that's my email was just like, hey, let's at least talk about it."
3763.26,3764.26," Oh, no, I don't know."
3764.26,3765.26, I sure see his fun.
3765.26,3767.26, That's what that's what people want to hear.
3767.26,3768.26, I totally want up your own.
3768.26,3771.26," Honestly, they just want to see his tearing ourselves apart."
3771.26,3773.26, Coming apart at the scenes.
3773.26,3776.26," Plus, a lot of, you know, phallic jokes."
3776.26,3777.26, Mm-hmm.
3777.26,3779.26," The kids like, or do suck in."
3779.26,3781.26," Oh, actually, I meant to ask you."
3781.26,3784.26," So the GT-The, the new 80 and 100-fit in your computer."
3784.26,3785.26, I want to give you.
3785.26,3787.26," Oh, actually, I haven't done that yet."
3787.26,3788.26, All right.
3788.26,3789.26, Sorry.
3789.26,3791.26, So I got a smaller version of the 8800.
3791.26,3794.26," Yeah, they just called the 800 GTS is supposed to the GTX."
3794.26,3795.26, Okay.
3795.26,3798.26, So that actually looks like it is going to fit in my box.
3798.26,3799.26, Cool.
3799.26,3800.26, Insert joke there.
3800.26,3802.26," And, but I haven't done it."
3802.26,3803.26, I don't know if it's any yet.
3803.26,3804.26, Our report back.
3804.26,3805.26," Oh, yeah."
3805.26,3806.26, We kind of need to wrap up.
3806.26,3807.26, Okay.
3807.26,3808.26," Last year on there, I was going to give."
3808.26,3811.26," Did you not did beta, did beta, did you not do it?"
3811.26,3819.26, And that would go to Battlefield 2042 because it just seemed like unbelievable to me that the
3819.26,3823.26, game shift with this big promise that what happens is when commanders are able to move the
3823.26,3827.26, Titans part of the new mode is that you have these giant floating basically shield
3827.26,3829.26, hover carriers if you're a comics nerd.
3829.26,3830.26," And you can, and you can visualize it."
3831.26,3832.26," Oh, it's cool."
3832.26,3833.26, Are new skill with the hands or they would process.
3833.26,3834.26, Anti-gravity.
3834.26,3835.26, Okay.
3835.26,3836.26, You're a school that I feel.
3836.26,3839.26, Or the gym Lee one that Rob life felt ripped off.
3839.26,3841.26," So anyway, you can control these things."
3841.26,3845.26, And the problem is that they were actual objects in the game.
3845.26,3848.26, And they created just these insane lag vortexes.
3848.26,3851.26, Anytime they're moving and it's trying to sync up player movement.
3851.26,3855.26," And everything that's happening on board, the Titan, to, you know, all the many, all the"
3855.26,3857.26," 64 people in the server, the deployable shields."
3857.26,3858.26, They sit down.
3858.26,3862.26," Their corpses that are trying to, the other medics are trying to revive their century guns,"
3862.26,3863.26, and all these things.
3863.26,3869.26," So, and it was clear in, and the beta the whole time, you're like, okay, this is a serious problem."
3869.26,3870.26, It doesn't work.
3870.26,3874.26," And, and like at the, you know, to the point where when the game came out, every, you know,"
3874.26,3876.26," everyone that was running a server was saying, you know what?"
3876.26,3880.26," If you move the stupid thing after the shields go down and we need to fight on,"
3880.26,3883.26," inside of it, we're going to kick and ban you immediately."
3883.26,3886.26," So it's like that, the fact that that went on and that that was tested."
3886.26,3889.26," And then finally, and they got to the point now, of course, where once the shield's"
3889.26,3891.26," good, you can't move the Titans anymore."
3891.26,3895.26," And that was in my review, you know, at the time, I was like, is this inevitable that that was"
3895.26,3896.26, what was going to happen to it?
3896.26,3900.26," And even everyone else, you know, is like, well, why didn't they just, like, put this in"
3900.26,3904.26," some space, put the interiors of these things and some space off of the regular map,"
3904.26,3906.26, where you just transition when you go through the door?
3906.26,3910.26," But anyway, that just seemed crazy to me that it was so clear that it was a problem"
3910.26,3912.26, in public beta.
3913.26,3916.26," And it's like, well, isn't that what a public beta is for is to address issues."
3916.26,3921.26," And that was by that was like huge job issues, you know, yeah, what is a problem?"
3921.26,3925.26," I mean, it's more and more of a problem these days when you see games being released,"
3925.26,3927.26," like two days after the public beta ends, right?"
3927.26,3932.26," Like, okay, so actually nothing that's happening here is going to make it into the game."
3932.26,3936.26," The beta, the public beta just serves this like a demo as a sales pitch."
3936.26,3938.26," Yeah, right."
3938.26,3941.26, So I wanted to make sure we gave that a news.
3941.26,3944.26," Sorry, even though it's all good now, at the time it was a do's."
3944.26,3948.26," Well, actually, how did a hero is might magic five fair on that in that respect?"
3948.26,3952.26," And because I know like they had some really crappy results in the multiplayer beta,"
3952.26,3953.26, didn't they?
3953.26,3958.26," Well, I might, if I have a totally wrong memory on this one, or I don't now."
3958.26,3959.26, Okay.
3959.26,3960.26, I can't remember.
3960.26,3962.26," No, I had the biggest issue."
3962.26,3964.26," You Jeff, you were going to play it netted up a,"
3964.26,3965.26, starting about it all the time.
3965.26,3969.26," It had some had some concerns when it came out, but not multiplayer."
3969.26,3970.26," Oh, okay."
3970.26,3971.26," Oh, it was single player."
3971.26,3972.26, I didn't play multiplayer.
3972.26,3973.26, Okay.
3973.26,3974.26," I don't, I don't play."
3974.26,3975.26, I have to take it back.
3975.26,3976.26, Great game.
3976.26,3977.26," Wow, let's not go."
3977.26,3979.26," All right, all right."
3979.26,3981.26," All right, this might be it."
3981.26,3983.26, I think on kind of a download with all these dooses.
3983.26,3987.26," We're going to have to, can we, can we say anything positive?"
3987.26,3991.26, You want to bless this podcast or the pop?
3991.26,3993.26, That's another downer though.
3993.26,3994.26," Yeah, never mind."
3994.26,3997.26, The pop doesn't like us on top of everybody else.
3997.26,3999.26, Pop doesn't like us.
3999.26,4000.26," Uh, pop."
4000.26,4002.26, We're officially coming to the US.
4002.26,4003.26, There you go.
4003.26,4004.26, I'll let you.
4004.26,4005.26, That's a positive.
4005.26,4006.26," Actually, two worlds."
4006.26,4007.26, Two worlds.
4007.26,4008.26," I saw that game, I saw that game."
4008.26,4013.26," I got a quick tour recently and they're actually, um, it's actually coming out really quick."
4013.26,4015.26," I mean, the first time I heard of it was what back in December."
4015.26,4016.26," Something like that, Sean?"
4016.26,4018.26," Yeah, it's a preview to back there."
4018.26,4019.26, Right.
4019.26,4020.26, And the games coming out in May.
4020.26,4022.26," It's actually looking like, I mean, it's trying to go for that gothic free,"
4022.26,4024.26, oblivion kind of like huge world to explore.
4024.26,4025.26, Okay.
4025.26,4026.26, We got an end note.
4026.26,4027.26, We missed it real quick.
4027.26,4028.26, Yeah.
4028.26,4029.26, Sorry.
4029.26,4030.26, Okay.
4030.26,4032.26, I'll be a perfect end to closer.
4032.26,4033.26, Okay.
4033.26,4034.26, Okay.
4034.26,4036.26," Anyway, so I checked out the game and it looks really cool."
4036.26,4038.26, The only question mark is because it's being made in Europe.
4038.26,4041.26," Will the, the lost in translation English kind of hamper the gameplay?"
4041.26,4042.26, Mm-hmm.
4042.26,4043.26, But it's a huge role.
4043.26,4044.26, It looks great.
4044.26,4046.26," Who's making, I mean, where's the big man?"
4046.26,4047.26," Uh, geez."
4047.26,4048.26, Reality pumped.
4048.26,4050.26," Is that's, that's reality pumped?"
4050.26,4051.26, Yeah.
4051.26,4052.26, Okay.
4052.26,4054.26, It's kind of where the thing is like their dev process is kind of work.
4054.26,4058.26," They put the entire slamming entire game together about, like if I have it done by May."
4058.26,4059.26, Uh-huh.
4059.26,4060.26," Well, that's where you're sharing."
4060.26,4061.26," And, no, but it actually, I know."
4061.26,4062.26, Believe me.
4062.26,4063.26," I was like, okay."
4063.26,4064.26, This has got to be total crap.
4064.26,4065.26, And just put it out there.
4065.26,4066.26, We're just going to show it later.
4066.26,4067.26, We're just going to show it to you.
4067.26,4068.26, It's made.
4068.26,4069.26, That's all we care about.
4069.26,4071.26," And they're, but they're saying that they're actually going to be able to ramp up"
4071.26,4074.26, multiplayer to like thousands of people and multiplayer.
4074.26,4078.26," So it's technically an MMO possibility, which is kind of interesting."
4078.26,4080.26," The, the answer right now is tentative,"
4080.26,4084.26," tentative, no for whether they'd actually charge for multiplayer."
4084.26,4088.26," But anyway, I just thought it was kind of interesting that they're, you know, how far"
4088.26,4089.26, long ago.
4089.26,4091.26," So like, at the last minute figuring out that you can have a thousand points."
4091.26,4092.26," No, I, I found that hard to believe."
4092.26,4093.26, Doesn't make an MMO.
4093.26,4096.26," It makes like, like, Guild Wars for something potentially no."
4096.26,4098.26, That's totally like broken.
4098.26,4099.26, That's good.
4099.26,4100.26, We can have them.
4100.26,4101.26, Let's put them in there.
4101.26,4102.26," Well, I know."
4102.26,4104.26," I can imagine if you know, like, but Quake Wars or something."
4104.26,4106.26," Well, they got a thousand dudes in here."
4106.26,4107.26," Well, there's, I know."
4107.26,4109.26, They're originally talking at the originally talking about like two to eight
4109.26,4110.26, people in multiplayer.
4110.26,4112.26," And they're saying,"
4112.26,4113.26," and I'm like, I don't know."
4113.26,4115.26, Two to eight or a thousand.
4115.26,4116.26, Or a thousand.
4116.26,4118.26, Seems like a lot of a factored design choices.
4118.26,4120.26," It might, it might limit gameplay."
4120.26,4123.26, A little crowded in this in right now.
4123.26,4127.26," But, you know, I, again, I don't know what the deal is, but it's interesting"
4127.26,4130.26," enough that they're putting, they're saying they could put this together."
4130.26,4132.26," I'm wondering how that, how they're going to do it."
4132.26,4133.26, But we'll keep our eye on that one.
4133.26,4134.26, That's the big thing for all of you.
4134.26,4137.26," That's the, every one of you that you know, is generic."
4137.26,4138.26, Stay tuned.
4138.26,4139.26, That's one to watch.
4139.26,4140.26, Just kidding.
4140.26,4141.26, Wanted to change everything.
4141.26,4142.26, There you go.
4142.26,4143.26, Thank you.
4143.26,4144.26, Thank you.
4144.26,4145.26, It could be.
4145.26,4146.26, It could be.
4146.26,4147.26," For a while, everyone wanted it."
4147.26,4148.26," Well, they still do."
4148.26,4151.26," Everyone wants to get in on the whole, like, bragging about higher player count thing."
4151.26,4152.26, Next guy.
4152.26,4153.26, It's like horse power.
4153.26,4154.26, Right.
4154.26,4155.26, I don't know.
4155.26,4156.26, Or make a fix in people.
4156.26,4157.26, Or make a fix in people.
4157.26,4158.26, Or make a fix in people.
4158.26,4159.26," And it's so, I mean, it happened that way."
4159.26,4161.26," The shooter space, you know, the point where you're,"
4161.26,4164.26," and, and Huxley is still promising over a hundred people in these big things."
4164.26,4167.26," But like, more is not always better."
4167.26,4169.26," And it's a soft, a pan."
4169.26,4172.26," Didn't, didn't it, Blibian prove that if you have a one good game, one person is going to enjoy it?"
4172.26,4176.26," I mean, well, not only in that, but even like when it is multiplayer to begin with,"
4176.26,4181.26," it's like sometimes like, I mean, half the time, you're playing a shooter and you start searching for, you know,"
4181.26,4182.26, like even team forcher.
4182.26,4184.26," You know, even way back then, I was a lesson I learned."
4184.26,4188.26," I wouldn't, if a max player passed to us like more than 24,"
4188.26,4193.26," and I'd actually prefer like, you know, 16 to 18, it would just experience with just start getting bossed."
4193.26,4194.26, Because there's just so many things.
4194.26,4196.26," You know, we just kind of take that mold and go,"
4196.26,4198.26," whew, wow, right."
4198.26,4199.26, This one's going to have a hundred.
4199.26,4202.26, And I really think about the implications of whether that's cool or not.
4202.26,4204.26," I mean, it's the image of just 100."
4204.26,4205.26, That's right.
4205.26,4209.26," I remember when, when I'd brought by Quake 4 and they were showing the EGM guys,"
4209.26,4213.26," and they were like, oh, what do you mean?"
4213.26,4215.26, You can only have four people in multiplayer?
4215.26,4217.26," You know, four to eight, like that."
4217.26,4218.26, What's the point of that?
4218.26,4223.26," You know, and they were trying to say like, well, we really believe in the quality of, you know,"
4223.26,4228.26," if someone's, every time someone kills you, you know who it was and what they were doing in this and that,"
4228.26,4231.26," you know, and it's like, while that game may not have been that good and,"
4231.26,4235.26," well, especially in a console space, but there is something like, it was essentially Quake 3."
4235.26,4239.26," And in time that was a really, I mean, I still think that's an excellent, just an amazing game."
4239.26,4244.26," It's just that it's for an increasingly smaller audience just because like,"
4244.26,4246.26, you have to be so good to compete.
4246.26,4247.26, This is a fun part.
4247.26,4251.26," But anyway, yeah, you could see how frustrating it was for them to try to like break through and tell the journey was like,"
4251.26,4255.26," you know, it doesn't really, you don't just because, you know,"
4255.26,4257.26, perfect dark offered this many players.
4257.26,4260.26, It doesn't necessarily mean to step down because our numbers are smaller.
4260.26,4266.26, My half-de-steer sheet of multiplayer shooter memories by far are the ones that happened in the old days at CGW.
4266.26,4272.26," When they were, you know, maybe just like six or eight of us at the most in logged in at one time."
4272.26,4274.26," Yeah, because it was so much just about payback."
4274.26,4275.26, And you could be negative.
4275.26,4280.26," Instead of, yes, so you could be like, maybe like four or four kills down from the top rank or something."
4280.26,4283.26," Instead of like, there's like those two dudes at the top."
4283.26,4285.26," Yeah, like 60 kills above everyone else."
4285.26,4286.26," Right. You always tell you, you can't."
4286.26,4288.26, Worthless pieces of shit down the bottom.
4288.26,4291.26," Try to get the rocket and one like like, it's your thing of health."
4291.26,4292.26," But, yeah, the half-life."
4292.26,4294.26," Okay, so, okay, we're getting the serious wrap-up."
4294.26,4295.26, Getting the serious wrap-up.
4295.26,4296.26, Getting the serious wrap-up.
4296.26,4297.26, Getting the serious wrap-up.
4297.26,4298.26, Getting the serious wrap-up.
4298.26,4299.26, Getting the serious wrap-up.
4299.26,4300.26, Getting the serious wrap-up.
4300.26,4303.26, Doesn't make those really payback.
4303.26,4306.26, Insolienably takes us off on a dorky note.
4306.26,4308.26," We could tied in, say, it's been less to support."
4308.26,4312.26, It's for Shonen Jump's pages once 17 and 116.
4312.26,4314.26, The book of shonen pages.
4314.26,4315.26," It's been Arabic session, isn't itkel?"
4315.26,4317.26, It wasn't our mail room and I grabbed it and laid down.
4317.26,4318.26," And it was, like readnya, so."
4318.26,4319.26, Uh huh.
4319.26,4321.26, And this is in the first chapter.
4321.26,4322.52," You, you, you, Haku show episode"
4322.52,4325.26, insufficient theory in our read.
4325.26,4329.76," And as I see it, you in turn have an obligation to fight"
4329.76,4332.64, to fight me with everything you've got.
4332.64,4334.14, But have you?
4334.14,4337.96, I've been pondering how he can be sure you've really done your best.
4337.96,4339.280000000001, Would it take pain?
4339.280000000001,4340.4400000000005, Fear of death.
4340.4400000000005,4341.72, Sheer age.
4341.72,4345.68, I'd be glad to apply them all if it would help you to excel.
4345.68,4346.96, Ooh!
4346.96,4348.68, That's the dialect.
4348.68,4350.0, That's the dialect.
4350.0,4351.0, That's the ellipsis.
4351.0,4352.0, That's the doctor.
4352.0,4355.0, He's crazy!
4355.0,4356.400000000001, A battle junkie!
4356.400000000001,4359.2, He's running on pure fighting instinct!
4360.0,4360.76, Instinct?
4360.76,4361.76, No!
4361.76,4362.76, My will!
4362.76,4365.76," This is my deliberate, considered goal."
4365.76,4367.76, Instinct is only about survival!
4367.76,4368.76, Like this!
4368.76,4372.76," And at that point, page 117, there's some smoke coming out of some..."
4372.76,4374.76, His shaker tip is growing off his shoulder.
4374.76,4376.76, These people got some dirt on the shoulder.
4376.76,4379.76," That was page 117, 116."
4379.76,4380.76, Thank you.
4380.76,4381.76," Thank you, Sean."
4381.76,4386.76, Next week we'll have you come on and make some fun.
4386.76,4387.76, The story of the dark culture.
4387.76,4388.76, Enemy is for adults.
4388.76,4392.56," What you don't understand is they found a way to take cartoons, which typically associate"
4392.56,4393.56, with children.
4393.56,4396.56, And they've been made adults stories for you.
4396.56,4397.56," Oh, they did."
4397.56,4398.56, Someone could say that's about the idea of the podcast.
4398.56,4399.56, Someone could say that about video games.
4399.56,4400.56, We're done.
4400.56,4401.56," That's what it's saying, dude."
4401.56,4404.56, Even praise got a better story than that.
4404.56,4405.56," Hey, now."
4405.56,4406.56, Come on.
4406.56,4407.56, Okay.
4407.56,4409.16, We'll be back next week with more hate.
4409.16,4410.16, Maybe a lot of little love.
4410.16,4411.16, Just a little bit.
4411.16,4413.360000000001, A little bit of love.
4413.360000000001,4414.360000000001, True.
4414.360000000001,4415.360000000001, We're lovers.
4415.360000000001,4416.360000000001, Okay.
4416.36,4417.36, Now you need it.
4417.36,4418.36, Bye.
4418.36,4419.36, Bye.
4419.36,4420.36, Bye.
