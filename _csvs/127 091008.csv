0.0,5.0, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio Wow that was loud.
5.0,7.0, There was a lot of my own here.
7.0,15.68," September 10th, 2008 and I'm here with the full Brodyo crew for maximum brodyo"
15.68,17.0, city.
17.0,21.0, Let's do the intros and get on with this show.
21.0,22.0, You?
22.0,24.0," Me, Ryan Scott."
24.0,25.0, Anthony.
25.0,27.0," Robert Ashley, Sean O'Yet."
27.0,29.0, And we got to skip on the boards.
29.0,33.24," And if anybody hears any crunching in the background, this is because Robert Ashley is eating"
33.24,34.24," his lunch, right?"
34.24,38.24, Which is cheddar flavor checks mix.
38.24,40.24," Oh, 60% less fat."
40.24,44.0," Well, fair, they take a box of mac and cheese and they dump the cheese powder."
44.0,46.0, But it's cereal.
46.0,48.519999999999996, You can probably pick that on your own actually for cheaper.
48.519999999999996,52.16," Yeah, I wasn't really looking to make my own checks mix."
52.16,54.36," I was at Walgreens, I was starving."
54.36,57.28, And I wish that they had left the 60% fat where it was.
57.28,59.28, So I wouldn't have to eat so much of it to get full.
59.28,61.28, 60% less fat.
61.28,62.28, Yeah.
62.28,65.28, So it has 40% the same amount of fat.
65.28,67.28," Well, it's about to do my math correctly."
67.28,68.28, It sucks.
68.28,70.28, I should have bought the reeds.
70.28,72.28," Yeah, you can't go around with the reeds."
72.28,77.28, I think the Doritos orange dust is the same as the craft mac or any cheese orange dust.
77.28,78.28, I don't know.
78.28,80.28, I don't think it's a sharp.
80.28,81.28, I wonder really.
81.28,84.28, Who of you guys is poured out the orange dust to eat it on the phone?
84.28,87.28," We could have an orange dust, you know, like blind taste test."
87.28,91.28, I wish that they sold Doritos orange dust on its own.
91.28,92.28," Oh my god, that'd be so good."
92.28,94.28, You could just put it on anything you want.
94.28,95.28, Absolutely.
95.28,99.28, There would be all these like super ghetto recipes for making Doritos cake.
99.28,100.28, Fry fish.
100.28,101.28, Fry fish in it.
101.28,102.28, Yeah.
102.28,103.28," Oh god, they would do that."
103.28,104.28, I bet.
104.28,105.28, Fry fish.
105.28,106.28, Fry fish in Doritos.
106.28,109.28, They do like an iron chef with Dorito dust.
109.28,111.28, I was so upset.
111.28,115.28," But secret ingredient, Doritos."
115.28,119.28," And then you get those shot of the chef and they're like,"
119.28,123.28, What would I do now?
123.28,124.28, Anyway.
124.28,126.28, Gelato is always the answer.
126.28,127.28, Gelato.
127.28,128.28, Yeah.
128.28,129.28," Any weird ingredient, Gelato."
129.28,130.28, Yeah.
130.28,131.28, Iron chef.
131.28,132.28, Have you guys watched Iron chef America?
132.28,133.28, Yeah.
133.28,135.28," It doesn't quite do it for me, not the same way."
135.28,136.28, Mm.
136.28,137.28, It's all right.
137.28,138.28, It's all right.
138.28,141.28, Don't have enough foods that I find incredibly disgusting.
141.28,142.28, That's the thing.
142.28,145.28, They feel more normal on the American one.
145.28,146.28, Yeah.
146.28,147.28, Like last one I watched.
147.28,148.28, It was just some fish.
148.28,149.28, It's like really?
149.28,150.28, Yeah.
150.28,151.28, I want to see.
151.28,152.28," Yeah, whatever."
152.28,157.28," And they try to like, they try to, you know, rip off the original presentation,"
157.28,158.28, which seems to be a ridiculous.
158.28,159.28, Yeah.
159.28,162.28, Also like last one I was on or I was on.
162.28,163.28, Because I'm always on that show.
163.28,166.28, Last time you iron chef Doritos.
166.28,167.28, That's not my watch.
167.28,172.28," The, you know, they have the one chef is near the one that judge his name is Jeffrey"
172.28,173.28, Sutterrather.
173.28,175.28, He's like that older sort of author.
175.28,178.28, He has like a lot of authorities written a bunch of food books.
178.28,181.28, But then the person in the middle is often a guess in this one last time I watched.
181.28,185.28, It was some random entertainment correspondent for entertainment weekly.
185.28,187.28, She'll collect shoes like 24 years old.
187.28,191.28," And I was, you know, when she was critiquing the Iron chef's food, I was thinking,"
191.28,194.28," like, those guys totally looked like they were thinking like,"
194.28,197.28, who the fuck are you to judge my food?
197.28,202.28," You know, I really could use it to little less muster to eat in that dish."
202.28,204.28, I just was really too prungent for me.
204.28,206.28," You know, and she writes like, movie reviews."
206.28,209.28," I was thinking like, God, what, for this guy to do there."
209.28,212.28, Do you know where someone who's got a job developing games?
212.28,216.28, That's what I think about all you fuckers reviewing my Sims game.
216.28,218.28," No, but I really did make me think about that."
218.28,221.28, It did make me think that's probably what they think about us.
221.28,224.28, I'm the one who's consistently keeping the show off track.
224.28,226.28, It needs to be randened by you Jeff.
226.28,230.28," Since I will never, you know, like, without you here, I'll do nothing but make dick jokes."
230.28,234.28, I'll use this opportunity to bring us into the domain of games.
234.28,235.28, Okay.
235.28,237.28," Where on shoe and Chris, that sort of stuff."
237.28,242.28," So not it you, and people on, at members, at people in our audience."
242.28,248.28," Yes, who for whatever reason think I'm absolutely incapable of moderating my own,"
248.28,250.28," you know, behavior and switching between different, you know,"
250.28,251.28, it's true.
251.28,256.28, I got labeled as a guy who keeps you in lying when it's really quite usually the opposite.
256.28,258.28, It was just both back and forth.
258.28,260.28," I mean, like, right now, the whole dreof thing."
260.28,263.28, It's not because we can't contain ourselves and we just decide.
263.28,265.28," Like, let's run with it and see what happens."
265.28,268.28," We think, well, I thought it was, yeah, look at Rob."
268.28,272.28, I just saw this really regretting bringing sex.
272.28,275.28," I just thought it was, I just said it was your lunch."
275.28,277.28," Yeah, no, it was fucking sad."
278.28,282.28," Because it's a, you know, it's sort of a glimpse into your, you know, vaguely pathetic life."
282.28,288.28," And if you could see beneath the shirt, you would see the consequences of a life we're eating."
288.28,289.28, We're not filming.
289.28,290.28, So you could take the shirt last night.
290.28,295.28," We had dinner in Robert revealed to us that he wears glasses so that people don't think he's, well,"
295.28,299.28," I mean, he wears glasses to see better, but rather context because, yeah,"
299.28,302.28, you don't want to be taking as a perpetual stoner or something.
302.28,305.28," But at the same time, it's just a Sarah Pailin glasses."
305.28,312.28," Not only that, not only are there to Sarah Pailin glasses, but a second after he got done explaining to us that this was the case."
312.28,318.28, We're in this restaurant and he's doing the sounds of turtles mating sex at like full ball.
318.28,321.28," We had to remind a bit like, you got the glasses on."
321.28,324.28," Well, maybe we can get him to do that later."
324.28,325.28," Yeah, I don't know."
325.28,329.28," I just noticed like in college when I got glasses, people treated me differently."
329.28,333.28," Because I'm without glasses, I look like fucking dumbass."
333.28,334.28, Did they punch you more?
334.28,335.28, No.
335.28,336.28, No.
336.28,339.28, Not at all.
339.28,342.28, You had a better school life than I did.
342.28,343.28," Oh, I did."
343.28,347.28," When did you get, no, I'm not saying I never got, I said not punched more, right?"
347.28,351.28," Definitely got my ass whipped plenty, but in college I didn't get my, you didn't."
351.28,352.28, You did.
352.28,353.28, That was what I was looking for.
353.28,354.28, You were making a stop.
354.28,356.28," I think like, a saltier."
356.28,357.28, Yeah.
357.28,358.28, For being different.
358.28,360.28," No, there was no assaulting for glasses."
360.28,363.28, It was pretty common in college to have glasses of it.
363.28,366.28," Yeah, it's like Ryan, like he really had people fuck with you."
366.28,369.28," Now that I think about it, not in college."
369.28,371.28," Yeah, that was just making it up."
371.28,374.28," Once a last time we got your ass kicked, Ryan."
374.28,376.28, Got my ass kicked.
376.28,378.28," That's a pretty strong, that's plenty."
378.28,379.28, That's plenty.
379.28,381.28, Or you kicked someone's ass.
381.28,382.28, I was just sort of assuming.
382.28,384.28," Okay, that's, that's an even, yeah."
384.28,386.28, I don't know if I can answer it.
386.28,387.28," Okay, so when to last one?"
387.28,388.28," He doesn't want to, you know,"
388.28,390.28, it was an element of the school lawsuit.
390.28,391.28," Genior, how are you?"
391.28,392.28," Sure, high school."
392.28,393.28," High school, you got your ass kicked."
393.28,396.28," I don't know if I got my ass kicked, but I certainly,"
396.28,401.28," How would you end up in a situation where there's like, you know, an altercation in a first place?"
401.28,403.28, Just people being jerks.
403.28,404.28, Really?
404.28,405.28, Really?
405.28,406.28, Pointing in a shoulder or something.
406.28,408.28," So you were like one of those guys in a movie where they,"
408.28,410.28," we would just walk by and hit you because you were,"
410.28,411.28, We kind of lit all of them.
411.28,412.28, Because that was all of us.
412.28,414.28," That's where we, yeah, we were the bros."
414.28,416.28," It wasn't me, man."
416.28,417.28, I guess you could.
417.28,419.28," No, I was like you though, though."
419.28,420.28, You could drop parallel.
420.28,421.28, Yeah.
421.28,422.28, Yeah.
422.28,423.28, All right.
423.28,424.28, So back to shoes.
424.28,425.28, We're back to school.
425.28,426.28, Yeah.
426.28,427.28, And there's sort of a blog.
427.28,430.28," They've been talking about just different aspects of what happens in,"
430.28,433.28, in Thusius press and when you're working with PR and so on.
433.28,434.28, So forth.
434.28,438.28," And last week, an anonymous guy from big publisher,"
438.28,441.28," he calls himself, wrote, you know,"
441.28,444.28," wrote in and gave, you know, his version of things."
444.28,446.28," And I asked you to read it Jeff, just kind of curious."
446.28,448.28," Because you're not going into PR, right?"
448.28,450.28, But you're going to be on that side of the fence.
450.28,451.28, I did read it.
451.28,454.28," And the first thing I thought of was like, when you describing how, you know,"
454.28,457.28," the chefs are looking at this woman eating their food with, like,"
457.28,458.28, total content.
458.28,461.28," It was funny to me because again, in this PR person's sort of"
461.28,463.28," rebuttal, it's that, well,"
463.28,466.28," developers put a whole lot of, you know,"
466.28,468.28, sweat and tears into these games.
468.28,471.28," And when you see just how much is going into it,"
471.28,475.28," it's difficult to see someone that might potentially have an un informed or less informed,"
475.28,478.28," you know, perspective on it, babbling."
478.28,481.28," And like, my immediate response and then one of you guys think is just the same."
481.28,484.28," It's like, well, it's not like Eric Hartman, you know,"
484.28,487.28, the famous World War II ways didn't have to know how to design an
487.28,492.28, engineer a plane in order to tell people whether or not it was an effective plane.
492.28,495.28," I mean, he had like 360 something like, you know,"
495.28,498.28," victories, like, it's not, it's like, it's like,"
498.28,500.28, this counting your audience.
500.28,504.28," It's like, game reviewers are no different than the people you're selling"
504.28,506.28," your games to like, yeah, that's right."
506.28,508.28," And so your audience isn't capable of sitting,"
508.28,510.28, whether or not the game that you've made is worth playing.
510.28,512.28," Yeah, that's right. That blog post kind of piss me off."
512.28,523.28," And I felt like, well, this person is totally not getting the idea that we would be looking at it as being consumer advocates that we're being representative of the people who will buy the game like you said."
523.28,526.28," And that, therefore, we're immanently qualified to do it."
526.28,528.28," I mean, or not everybody is,"
528.28,531.28," but if you've done this for a certain long and, you know,"
531.28,535.28," how to write, you know, how to think critically that that certainly should be enough."
535.28,539.28," Well, that blog post kind of, I mean, implies the developers are,"
539.28,544.28, they want us to score games based on effort and not the final product.
544.28,546.28," You know, that sort of what I got from."
546.28,548.28," No, it's like, if what if the iron chef like, you know,"
548.28,553.28," his sister and law was in the hospital last week and, you know,"
553.28,558.28," he just got served of horse papers, but he's, what if he served you food that had like human feces and, you know,"
559.28,561.28," like, probably wouldn't need it."
561.28,566.28," Well, that's got to score he sucks, but are you going to be a delicacy?"
566.28,572.28," And that's for the, I mean, this is just for the, this, what this is for is the whole score issue."
572.28,574.28, That's the ultimate lady important thing I believe.
574.28,578.28," And like it seemed to be the case in, in this blog response,"
578.28,580.28," I mean, Ryan, you were talking, I'm going to make you talk."
580.28,583.28," You tell me about some issues you had with,"
583.28,586.28," you know, topspin, reviewing the topspin game."
586.28,593.28," Right. Like a lot of the points, you know, like this guy makes in this blog post or things I hear all the time as the reviews"
593.28,597.28," editor here, you know, PR people calling up and agree about,"
597.28,602.28, ultimately comes down to the score nine times out of ten.
602.28,610.28," And this specific case, I reviewed topspin 3GM and I gave it a, a sea of some sort."
611.28,619.28," And the PR guy, they passed the PR guy called me up and he was upset about the score and he,"
619.28,621.28, his immediate sort of defense.
621.28,624.28," He's like, well, maybe you weren't the right person to review this game, you know,"
624.28,632.28, and he started citing other people who had been sort of like positive about it from preview events.
632.28,634.28, You're just not a tennis guy.
634.28,635.28," Well, that's the thing."
635.28,637.28, You need to get your tennis guy on that game only.
637.28,639.28, That's tennis expert.
639.28,643.28, That's a positive part of this is part of the course of this blog thing as well.
643.28,645.28," And Ryan, you've got your."
645.28,649.28, That's the thing about like I didn't play tennis games since since since virtual tennis.
649.28,653.28," You wouldn't know from looking at me, but I made big fan of tennis."
653.28,655.28, You're an efficient not a.
655.28,660.28," And so, you know, I have, you know, like I said to you, for you see how many hours of the original topspin I've got."
660.28,662.28," Yeah, I know tennis games very well."
662.28,665.28," And, you know, from that perspective,"
665.28,670.28," like I didn't, I wasn't really digging topspin three to the extent that this guy obviously wanted me to."
670.28,671.28, Yeah.
671.28,676.28," And I mean, he just he kept scramble and for excuses, you know, when it was always centered around the score."
676.28,678.28, And it's also just funny to me.
678.28,683.28," I mean, that is I read that that post and he does talk about that sort of, you know,"
683.28,690.28, needing the the press to the editors of publications to do a sign reviews to someone who really knows the genre.
690.28,695.28, I think it's important to like a sign of review to someone who isn't going to do it with an agenda.
695.28,702.28," You know, somebody who like I'm like, I'm not going to give an RTS game to somebody who has never played an RTS."
702.28,703.28, Yeah.
703.28,706.28," You know, like there needs to be something like a ready and not."
706.28,713.28, But it's also just funny in the context of modern gaming when things are like totally not really very specialized anymore.
713.28,716.28," I mean, games are pretty open to everyone."
716.28,726.28," I mean, is there really a first person shooter type of person anymore, considering the way that first person shooter games like cater to the masses now?"
726.28,733.28, Like do you really need to be like an expert in first person shooters to play halo and understand what's going on in halo?
733.28,736.28," Well, every critics going to have a different response anyway."
736.28,739.28," And that's like when you were saying, you know, you wouldn't put it on RTS player and RTS review."
739.28,744.28," I was thinking like, well, this is the good thing about having multiple voices respond to something."
744.28,752.28," And not to pimpy jamer anything, but I mean, just in some ideal scenario where you have like a podcast is more what I have in mind where you have a course of people responding."
752.28,760.28," That is totally not only is it a viable perspective, it's one that in previous parts of the whole, you know, promotional campaign for the game."
760.28,766.28," I'm sure they were saying, well, we don't want to just make an RTS that's for the duties played every RTS that's come along."
766.28,772.28," We want to show people that this is a genre that they made, they shouldn't be frightened of or that they could get in, you know,"
772.28,777.28," that person's got a valid point of view, you know, I mean, that was definitely my perspective on a company here."
777.28,792.28," I was going to start talking about that. Then I think it's just, it's cool to have someone to have the perspective of the person who knows it topped a bottom can break down every single like the whole gene, the entire genealogy of system changes and just convention."
792.28,798.28," Although that has its own drawbacks. I mean, a hate reading review is like a history of the genre."
798.28,803.28, Someone who is obviously played a lot of games and they want to tell you everything about it.
803.28,814.28," And you get to like the two lines of like real criticism of the of the game after you've received this like long genealogy of, you know, of what went into the games before it."
814.28,825.28," Well, if the genealogy like if you situate the game that you're talking about in that genealogy and that's clear the entire time that you're only bringing up the context so that you can better understand the game."
825.28,833.28," But yeah, I mean, if it's just like, I mean, we've seen those, the dumpiest S, reviews, things like I started off playing the the Tocopon series when I was like,"
833.28,840.28," And I went to Japan and then this game came out and then suddenly you get to like an Eke Tiki and then it's like,"
840.28,843.28, So that sounds more Hawaiian than Japanese.
844.28,857.28," Yeah, so what what about it? Like, I mean, I guess in general, it's just like, you know, just want someone who is going to give it a chance and try to understand it and try to understand what goes into it."
857.28,867.28," And I think take it on the terms that it's presenting itself or the developers are you know, what what are they trying to accomplish here did they succeed or what they were trying to do."
867.28,878.28," You know, I think that it's important for us to match a review or somebody who gets the intention of and who the audience is, you know, so that they're coming at it with realistic expectations."
878.28,888.28," And that that's difficult to because like, it's not necessarily slippery slow, but I do think that down that road lies the whole fans of the genre trap."
888.28,900.28," And that's where you get into it. Like they say that this game was made for this person. So we got to find just this person in the whole time or even worse, you aren't that person, but you're writing your your review and you know,"
900.28,904.28, You're conducting your criticism trying to assume that person's perspective when you really aren't having it.
904.28,911.28," Okay, you're just imagining shit. Right. What if your guts telling you, this is horrible. I don't like it, but you're hypothesizing you exist in some of a person out there who loves it."
911.28,930.28," Well, right, that's totally different. I mean, I guess what I mean is that they understand I'm bringing up this particular point because when I was reading some stuff about sport and not official reviews, but message board comments and people were complaining about that this wasn't a hardcore enough strategy game and I felt like why are you expecting that."
930.28,936.28, That's not what Maxis has ever done. They don't they don't make that kind of game. If you were looking for some kind of like
936.28,946.28," Campaign in which you were going to get increasingly difficult AI challenges. One has Maxis ever made that game never and you know, so I'm responding to that sort of thing."
946.28,952.28," Like if you're going to review it that way, you're not reviewing the game that Maxis ever had any intention of making."
952.28,968.28," Although in the defense of those reviews that I've read the same stuff, I mean the game has like from day one been sort of framed as this epic thing that tries to explore like the history of game development different genres and I think people like"
968.28,975.28," I want to speak to cover why. Yeah, I'm not going to just speak to that sport has problems. A lot of problems, but just that specific idea."
975.28,981.28," Yeah, I'm disappointed because this isn't a hardcore strategy game. It's like I never thought I was going to be hard to understand."
981.28,992.28," But what about if you're not disappointed that's not necessarily hardcore strategy and so far as it conforms to conventions of the strategy genre, but in that it's not in that ultimately you don't find that it has"
992.28,1008.28," It has only a fraction of the depth that early advanced looks sure suggested it might be there in the game. I mean the game has been presented at like science symposiums. Like I said, it was on cover wired. It was you know, it's so many different context and suggesting to different people that like this."
1008.28,1017.28," There's something for scientists here, there's something for the most casual of gamers conceivable and like the other thing though is that I think so far at least to my knowledge."
1017.28,1024.28," Even though that reaction has been strong among the select group of people to the point where we now know that they're on Amazon,"
1024.28,1034.28," Mucking with the review ratings turning it down because of the DRM mainly, but then also citing other issues about the difference between what was delivered in their expectations."
1034.28,1036.28, A lot of it is.
1036.28,1041.28," Max is in the realm of the world right in the response interviews I've seen has just said,"
1042.28,1055.22," Let me let you know the interview. Rast is this the case that this game was dumped down for certain audience and you'd be like I think that's a fair statement, right. So that's the thing. It's like if on their side if he's saying that this is going to be game that everyone's going to play you can give it to your kid maybe a little you know"
1055.22,1059.22, spark some interest in biology or something.
1059.22,1062.82," Then you don't turn around and try to pretend to the other person, well, at the same time,"
1062.82,1064.02, you're not getting it.
1064.02,1065.98," This is actually the most complicated, you know,"
1065.98,1067.22, writing that's ever been released.
1067.22,1070.02," He's just saying, like, he's just taking, you take the knocks."
1070.02,1073.82," If you're going to, if your game, if you're stating that your game isn't for those people,"
1073.82,1075.22, then you really have to brush them inside.
1075.22,1076.6200000000001," And so far, I think they're doing just that."
1076.6200000000001,1080.22," It's like, well, there's 300 people, there's, there's, you know, whatever."
1080.22,1084.22," There's 3000 people bitching on Amazon, but if there's fucking 5 million that buy this,"
1084.22,1085.22, you know what?
1085.22,1093.22," Right. I mean, I think somebody pointed out that despite all that the Amazon hub of it was still the number one game on Amazon,"
1093.22,1094.22, even with all of those.
1094.22,1096.22, It probably contributed to it.
1096.22,1098.22, Maybe.
1098.22,1101.22, And certainly the RM thing is a real issue.
1101.22,1107.22," And I'd say, you know, a fuck up on an on EA's part and not a cool."
1107.22,1109.22, I don't think this has been handled well.
1109.22,1112.22," And I think, you know, I don't know,"
1112.22,1120.22," they've come out and now it's and said that the DRM would be in Red Alert 3, but that they were going to allow for more for more installs."
1120.22,1122.22, I guess up to 5 now.
1122.22,1129.22," But like I personally am about to face this exact issue with my copy of sport because I'm getting, I have to do a system wipe on my,"
1129.22,1132.22," machine at home, which is just completely boring."
1132.22,1136.22," So I have to read, you know, I have to reformat it and reinstall windows."
1136.22,1138.22, And I'm going to lose my spore install.
1138.22,1140.22, I've already installed it twice.
1140.22,1141.22, You've had three times.
1141.22,1143.22, How late you could still call it three times.
1143.22,1145.22," But you could just, you have a third thing you did."
1145.22,1146.22, You got it.
1146.22,1147.22, I don't know.
1147.22,1153.22," I personally find it offensive to have to call somebody and say, excuse me, I used all three of my installs."
1153.22,1155.22, And I swear I'm not a criminal.
1155.22,1156.22, I bought this game.
1156.22,1159.22," I don't have my receipt, but I did buy it."
1159.22,1169.22," You know, I hate being treated like a criminal or with suspicion and just buying a game that automatically assumes that you might be the type of person to spread it out."
1169.22,1172.22, Over the internet or give it to all your friends or something.
1172.22,1175.22, We can get why they're doing it.
1175.22,1177.22, Everybody in the same get why.
1177.22,1178.22, That's not in dispute.
1178.22,1180.22, And we don't want their game stolen either.
1180.22,1181.22, Yeah.
1181.22,1182.22," I mean, but I just am wondering to be in the industry."
1182.22,1184.22, But there's got to be other ways.
1184.22,1190.22," And certainly, you know, companies like Valve have figured out other ways in which there doesn't have to be this kind of loan."
1190.22,1194.22, The irony is that sporelessly to the internet before it ever hit retail.
1194.22,1197.22," And at the people bitching on Amazon,"
1197.22,1199.22, it's likely the ones that stole it.
1199.22,1200.22, Right.
1200.22,1202.22, Or would never bought it in the first place.
1202.22,1203.22, Yeah.
1203.22,1205.22," So I think that those, you know, you can dismiss those morons."
1205.22,1209.22," But but the, but the DRM issue is real for sure."
1209.22,1211.22," And so,"
1211.22,1214.22," So, did we after you installed three times you just can't ever install the other day?"
1214.22,1216.22, You got to call a number and get more.
1216.22,1218.22, That's like a window is installed.
1218.22,1220.22," If you ever had to do that, like Microsoft."
1220.22,1224.22," Let's like trying to disconnect your, I mean, cancel your Xbox live subscription."
1224.22,1225.22, Try that one day.
1225.22,1227.22, I think that's a lot more difficult.
1227.22,1229.22, I think that's a lot more difficult.
1229.22,1231.22, It's a lot more drama than I want.
1231.22,1233.22," You know, it's like, can you just cancel over the system?"
1233.22,1239.22," Like, you know, when you want to, like, if you're going to cancel your cable, you recently switched to another, like, cable, internet and TV cable provider."
1239.22,1243.22," And you have the whole confrontational thing where, like, why are you?"
1243.22,1245.22, Are you sure? What could we do to make you not want?
1245.22,1247.22," It's like, no, fucking cancel."
1247.22,1249.22, I wish I can't have just press a button.
1249.22,1250.22, Why do I have to talk to you?
1250.22,1252.22," So, I mean, I just got rid of HBO that way."
1252.22,1254.22, And I did it online and it was awesome.
1254.22,1256.22," I didn't have to, like, justify it all."
1256.22,1258.22," And I had it, like, ready in my head."
1258.22,1259.22, So I thought for sure.
1259.22,1260.22," I mean, I'm gonna have to..."
1260.22,1261.22, It's like breaking up with the girl guy.
1261.22,1262.22," Yeah, I know."
1262.22,1265.22, I'm sorry. You get to the promises over and the wires over.
1265.22,1267.22," And the new show's going to peeled, I mean, I'm sorry."
1267.22,1268.22, I think it'd be fun.
1268.22,1270.22, I think after the vampire show starts.
1270.22,1271.22, It's a call.
1271.22,1272.22, It doesn't know when called me on it.
1272.22,1276.22," I think it'd be funny that it call and be like, I want to, you know, I want to get rid of HBO."
1276.22,1278.22," Oh, sir, can we ask you why?"
1278.22,1281.22," Well, how familiar you are with season five of the wire."
1281.22,1285.22," Yeah, I mean, spoiler alert."
1285.22,1287.22," But yeah, what you did to proposition is that."
1287.22,1289.22, It just wasn't down with that.
1289.22,1291.22," Oh, yeah."
1291.22,1294.22, That would be video game fan territory then.
1294.22,1295.22, Yeah.
1295.22,1297.22," I'm sure actually, probably not."
1297.22,1298.22, I'm sure it happens.
1298.22,1301.22," Maybe if we have a listener that actually works in, like, whatever,"
1301.22,1303.22," call these shirts, what would it be for HBO?"
1303.22,1304.22," Oh, don't you think?"
1304.22,1307.22, The right thing about HBO probably every day.
1307.22,1309.22, And now after some episode of whatever.
1309.22,1313.22," And it's like, how can you possibly do that to Joey?"
1313.22,1314.22, Yeah.
1314.22,1315.22," Oh, no."
1315.22,1316.22," Sorry, sir."
1316.22,1317.22, I'm just working in.
1317.22,1321.22," You, you and you mean you Jeff is Robert Hibbin playing sport."
1321.22,1323.22," I know Anthony, you started last night."
1323.22,1324.22, And did.
1324.22,1327.22," So let's, I want to hear about the game itself."
1327.22,1329.22, DRM and all that shit aside.
1329.22,1330.22, Haven't you been playing to?
1330.22,1331.22, I can.
1331.22,1333.22, Anthony got it for me for my birthday last night.
1333.22,1334.22, And so my phone's ringing.
1334.22,1336.22, You got it for me for birthday last night.
1336.22,1337.22, And I didn't have time to.
1337.22,1338.22, You should take it to play it.
1338.22,1339.22, But I'm just on the phone.
1339.22,1342.22," Because it's like, it was not available, which means it's the usual."
1342.22,1346.22," It's the California like, Mark Littacle Cause calling the tell you to vote."
1346.22,1348.22," No, on Proposition 7 or whatever."
1348.22,1349.22, It's some unusual shit.
1349.22,1354.22," It's probably like it's like, what is the difference between a pit bow and a hockey mob?"
1354.22,1359.22, A pit bow believes in evolution and climate change.
1359.22,1364.22," Oh, man."
1364.22,1365.22, Okay.
1365.22,1366.22, So the fact is for.
1367.22,1368.22, Yeah.
1368.22,1369.22, So I've only.
1369.22,1370.22, I start with Robert.
1370.22,1372.22, We can't trust you anymore.
1372.22,1374.22," Oh, it's awesome."
1374.22,1375.22, I'm the one who gets it.
1375.22,1376.22, I'm the one who gets it.
1376.22,1378.22, I'm the one who gets it.
1378.22,1382.22, I've played through the cellular stage.
1382.22,1384.22, And I'm like at the end of the creature stage.
1384.22,1386.22, So I just got it on Sunday night.
1386.22,1389.22, And I have not been able to play as much as I would like.
1389.22,1395.22," So far though, I have no, I, I don't think that I could possibly like say that I have a grasp on it."
1395.22,1398.22, Enough to to see how like the reviews stack up.
1398.22,1402.22," I do really enjoy playing with the creator, though, which I never got to download."
1402.22,1404.22, I never got around to doing that.
1404.22,1407.22," And like, and I've spent most of my time doing that."
1407.22,1412.22, So it's pretty pretty enjoyable.
1412.22,1415.22, But I'd be interested to see like.
1415.22,1417.22, What else is there in the game to do?
1417.22,1420.22, Like right now I'm in the in the creature stage.
1420.22,1423.22," And like hunting for fruit and you know, following my,"
1423.22,1429.22, my family across the the the the whole geographic area to find my next nest.
1429.22,1434.22, And then befriending people haven't really had any fights or anything because I'm an herbivore being max chill.
1434.22,1439.22, Running from predators or I ran into one predator who destroyed me.
1439.22,1440.22, It was like some giant creature.
1440.22,1441.22, They do that.
1441.22,1443.22," Yeah, random giant creatures."
1443.22,1448.22," Yeah, yeah, but mostly I've been, you know, dancing and singing and giving piece of chance."
1448.22,1451.22, How does that make it with a lot of different animals?
1452.22,1453.22, It's pretty fun at first.
1453.22,1455.22, And then I do it like a million times.
1455.22,1457.22," And I'm like, I think I want to kill some of these."
1457.22,1459.22, Do you know what's going to happen to you yet?
1459.22,1462.22, If you keep evolving that way as a piece loving hacky sack.
1462.22,1463.22, Little.
1463.22,1464.22, I don't know.
1464.22,1465.22, You did.
1465.22,1466.22, Do you want to spoil it?
1466.22,1467.22," Yeah, yeah, spoil it."
1467.22,1469.22, Because because this is what I did.
1469.22,1472.22, And it actually was a little disconcerting to me.
1472.22,1473.22, Yeah.
1473.22,1476.22," If you go along whatever path you go along,"
1476.22,1479.22, it that when you get to the next phase of the game.
1479.22,1481.22, So you're in creature and you're going to go into.
1481.22,1482.22," No, you're in tribal now."
1482.22,1484.22, I think now you're in creature.
1484.22,1485.22, You're going to go into tribal.
1485.22,1486.22, Okay.
1486.22,1491.22, It starts choosing for you what kind of society you are based on your actions.
1491.22,1494.22, So if you continue along these lines of being the peace loving.
1494.22,1495.22, I love everybody.
1495.22,1496.22, I'm going to make friends with everybody.
1496.22,1499.22, Soon you will be able to just sell it.
1499.22,1502.22," This is like, even in the manual, it was clear that they let you know ahead of you."
1502.22,1505.22, They're basically three affiliations in each stage.
1505.22,1507.22," And in the first, it starts off like you were robbers saying,"
1507.22,1509.22, or a reward on the board and carnivore.
1509.22,1513.22," And then it seems as though there's an equivalent choice along every,"
1513.22,1516.22," you know, in every different phase to the point when you get to the space phase."
1516.22,1519.22," It's like religion, economy, or like, you know,"
1519.22,1522.22, warrior sort of scenario.
1522.22,1523.22, Yeah.
1523.22,1526.22, You have the chance to influence it and go in a different direction.
1526.22,1530.22," But if you pursue a particular way, you're locked into that."
1530.22,1533.22," So what bothered me when I got to that stage,"
1533.22,1535.22," I said this on some of the podcasts,"
1535.22,1540.22," but when you, when I pursued that peace loving way and then when I got to the"
1540.22,1545.22," sieve phase and I had to, you know, to win that and go on to space,"
1545.22,1548.22, I had to convert all the other cities.
1548.22,1551.22, And the way you do that is very aggressive.
1551.22,1554.22," You know, and I mean, it's a, it's a funny animation."
1554.22,1555.22, It's nicely done.
1555.22,1558.22," You know, a giant holographic image of you,"
1558.22,1562.22," towers over the opposing city and you're sort of speaking with megaphones,"
1562.22,1564.22," basically, you know,"
1564.22,1569.22," and you know, they eventually get converted to your"
1569.22,1571.22," to your religion and I thought, like, well, fuck,"
1571.22,1574.22, I don't want to be like some religious desperate.
1574.22,1575.22," I was like, preaching love and peace."
1575.22,1577.22, I guess that's what I guess is.
1577.22,1578.22, I guess that's what it makes sense.
1578.22,1581.22," I mean, past phism was a religious idea,"
1581.22,1585.22, historically before it was ever a political way.
1585.22,1586.22, Sorry.
1586.22,1587.22, Go on.
1587.22,1590.22," I'm just saying that I would say that taking the violent approach to me,"
1590.22,1593.22, rather speaks of the founding of most religions and stuff like that.
1593.22,1596.22, And I just found it on a bunch of conflict and early tribal war
1596.22,1597.22, fair and stuff like that.
1597.22,1599.22," So it seemed to me like in your tribal phase,"
1599.22,1601.22," if you were all aggressive, it kind of be,"
1601.22,1602.22," I mean, like, you know,"
1602.22,1603.22, is right.
1603.22,1605.22," I thought, like, you know, we'd all hang."
1605.22,1607.22, And they just like want to be with me.
1607.22,1609.22, They'd convert to my to my ship.
1609.22,1611.22," Well, I was clenid love."
1611.22,1612.22, Exactly.
1612.22,1613.22," Yeah, maybe be back."
1613.22,1615.22, This is the interesting thing about the game.
1615.22,1617.22," I think for me is that like, when I played,"
1617.22,1619.22, I want to look at its implicit messages.
1619.22,1621.22, When we talked about right last to ask him what he saw
1621.22,1623.22," or the implicit messages in the game, it's not like,"
1623.22,1625.22," I'm not expecting it's not like if the messages are good,"
1625.22,1627.22, then I like the game.
1627.22,1629.22, I'm just like irrespective of review scores and all that shit.
1629.22,1630.22, I just want to see what it says.
1630.22,1632.22," And even looking at the manual,"
1632.22,1635.22," I started to see some, like, for example,"
1635.22,1637.22," you know, after you get to the space fairing stage,"
1637.22,1641.22, you're able to basically take your build and re-roll it more
1641.22,1646.22, less by adopting the religion or the culture of some other thing.
1646.22,1648.22," It's almost like, you then become whatever they are."
1648.22,1650.22, So it's like I could convert to Jeff's world or something.
1650.22,1654.22," And implicit message there is that at least when a species gets to this,"
1654.22,1658.22," you know, space fairing stage that there's, you know,"
1658.22,1660.22," I don't believe in like genetic determinism,"
1660.22,1664.22, but what this suggests is that there's no longer any relation or no longer any restrictions
1664.22,1668.22, whatsoever shaping force from their history and their genes.
1668.22,1670.22," And in this case, we would know give you some examples, like say,"
1670.22,1675.22, a predilection for interspecies violence or any of these kind of things.
1675.22,1678.22, It's like you just like wish them away and you become whatever you want.
1678.22,1681.22," And another example would be like if you're an herbivore,"
1681.22,1685.22, you're immediately becoming like the hearted Christianes of the world.
1685.22,1686.22," And it's like meanwhile we know,"
1686.22,1689.22, there are plenty of herbivore species that chill members of their own.
1689.22,1690.22, They fight to the dead.
1690.22,1692.22," I mean, like look at like rams and stuff."
1692.22,1693.22, They just don't want to eat them.
1693.22,1694.22, So they break their neck.
1694.22,1696.22," But you can't, and you can't do that in the game, though,"
1696.22,1698.22," as a number of where you can kill the other species,"
1698.22,1700.22, you just don't eat them.
1700.22,1701.22, But you can kill them.
1701.22,1702.22, That's right.
1702.22,1704.22," But I mean, if you're saying as you progress into the next stages,"
1704.22,1706.22," then the natural,"
1707.22,1709.22," if I can't kill enough of them,"
1709.22,1712.22, then the game will say you are a predator.
1712.22,1714.22," You're an herbivore, but you're a predator."
1714.22,1717.22," What happens, say for example, if you do like Robert and you start off as a kind of"
1717.22,1723.22, creature and then you end up changing your affiliations as you go into the tribal more likely
1723.22,1724.22, to civilization phase.
1724.22,1727.22," And you're like, well, I'm going to be an herbivore now."
1727.22,1731.22," Eating probably doesn't even figure in in the civilization phase, I'm guessing."
1731.22,1732.22, I don't have another game at that point.
1732.22,1733.22," Yeah, it's another game."
1733.22,1734.22," Yeah, right."
1734.22,1737.22, Then it's basically how you're taking up with the other civilizations.
1737.22,1740.22," And at any point, you have the option of how to do it."
1740.22,1744.22," So, you know, you are making choices that matter,"
1744.22,1749.22, but it's the simplicity of the choices that at times bothered me.
1749.22,1754.22," This is, it sounds like, I mean, I know the answer to this question just from the reviews and stuff I've read,"
1754.22,1760.22," but like, say what if you want to experiment and you want to lay your egg in a nest of another creature,"
1760.22,1763.22, you want to basically try to become a cuckoo or something like that.
1763.22,1765.22," I mean, there's nothing like that, right? I mean, it's just no."
1765.22,1771.22," My understanding, though, is that it that's, I could be wrong, but I think that's something that unlocks"
1771.22,1774.22, if at a certain point after you've been in space for a while.
1774.22,1776.22, You're talking about like interspecies?
1776.22,1783.22," No, a 9K, a specific like the cuckoo bird, and what the term cuckoo comes from, is the bird will lay its egg."
1783.22,1784.22, Right.
1784.22,1788.22, And its egg is colored to resemble that of whatever species nest it's laying in.
1788.22,1794.22," And then the, because of the way that, you know, the other bird works, it's not like based on recognition of its own offspring,"
1794.22,1797.22," so much as if something hatches in its nest and it takes up, right?"
1797.22,1801.22," It's therefore its own offspring, and of course you'll see a cuckoo bigger than the host bird,"
1801.22,1807.22," and it pushes out, not only that, it's further evolved so that once it hatches prior to the other eggs in the nest,"
1807.22,1812.22," and then its first act is to push those eggs out, and then let us lay Bakker."
1812.22,1815.22, And so basically what's happening is this other bird's raising it.
1815.22,1817.22, So I'm just saying situations like that.
1817.22,1827.22," That's not really that different from the way it really is in the game, because I mean when you, when you create a new, you know, version of yourself,"
1827.22,1833.22," it can be completely different from everything that came before and what you've done genetically,"
1833.22,1840.22," and then when you hatch it's just you, you know, the other, the other people are around, but I mean you are in the driver's seat."
1840.22,1842.22," You might as well be the cuckoo bird, you know."
1842.22,1843.22, Right.
1843.22,1844.22, Yeah.
1844.22,1846.22," So there's another, yeah."
1846.22,1848.22, So what else about this?
1848.22,1852.22, Well I do like that that creators a lot.
1852.22,1858.22," So all of those tools, and I do think that's where a lot of the longevity for a lot of the players"
1858.22,1860.22, is going to come from in this game.
1860.22,1863.22," It's just people who like to make cool shit, and we'll keep making it."
1863.22,1868.22," So I think some people are going to take those tools, and that's going to be the game for them,"
1868.22,1872.22," and they'll probably get a lot out of it that way, because the tools are pretty,"
1873.22,1874.22, amazing.
1874.22,1880.22," And what I liked was that at every stage, there was another tool to play with basically."
1880.22,1886.22," So, and you know, like I actually didn't know, I guess just from not paying attention during previous,"
1886.22,1890.22," that like I could design my own plane, or I could design my own boat."
1890.22,1893.22," I was surprised when that stuff came along, and that's a pretty neat."
1893.22,1899.22," So I do think that maybe sports suffers from having been like way over exposed,"
1900.22,1904.22," and that like every aspect of the game was revealed to people who were following it,"
1904.22,1908.22, way before anyone saw it.
1908.22,1911.22," It would have been interesting to see, I mean we talked about this before I think,"
1911.22,1913.22, but like what if we didn't know about it?
1913.22,1916.22," Yeah, sure when the creators did show up on going."
1916.22,1919.22," Right, which will be the case for a lot of people that picked this game."
1919.22,1923.22," Yeah, I do think like I was thinking the other day when I was playing it,"
1923.22,1926.22, it feels like too much in a way.
1926.22,1930.22, It's over and it was over and vicious from the start.
1930.22,1932.22, I mean we knew it was from the start.
1932.22,1936.22," They knew it was from the start, and then they did have to kind of scale back at the end."
1936.22,1942.22," But I feel even, you know, and I actually asked Lucy Bradshaw this when I interviewed her,"
1942.22,1950.22," was like, couldn't you have taken any one of these phases and gone laterally out and just made a game out of that phase?"
1950.22,1955.22," That it's almost like, it almost feels like each one is just not quite as great as it could have been."
1955.22,1961.22," If that one got itself got the loving treatment, that the whole project did."
1961.22,1966.22," And yeah, I feel like you really feel that, for me, like the tribal on the sidestate,"
1966.22,1971.22," and I know this is not a minority opinion, are the ones that feel like kind of like,"
1971.22,1975.22," cobbled together, you know, and you're just sort of waiting to get into space."
1976.22,1981.22, And space to me feels much more like the game that will actually wanted to make the whole time.
1981.22,1989.22," And I don't that may not be true, but that's how it feels to me that like, okay, this was all sort of the prologue to get out here into the thing that he's really into."
1989.22,1993.22, And if you want that you can you can start the game in the space stage.
1993.22,1999.22," I don't think you can, the last night when I started it, it was like, I went to go check out if I could play the phases."
1999.22,2003.22, And yesterday it said that I had played enough of the creature phase to unlock the civilization.
2003.22,2009.22," Yeah, so that's the first time celebrated ramping the first time through you have to play each phase a certain amount of time."
2009.22,2012.22, You don't even have to finish it before it unlocks the next one.
2012.22,2019.22," Let me play devil's advocate and ask this, like when the Sims came out, I think it made a lot of sense to a great many people that."
2019.22,2027.22," The idea that you could, you know, have these little humans that have romantic relationships and mansions and all these things."
2027.22,2029.22, People could immediately identify with it.
2029.22,2033.22," Even if it wasn't like the typical gamers, the ones that get angry that we fit exist and this kind of shit."
2033.22,2040.22," But you can, I apologize, I just see why this is going to, do I people are going to latch on to this and I predict success for this."
2040.22,2048.2200000000003, Do you think that sport has that same ability that people are going to say I want to make weird creatures and spaceships and stuff?
2048.2200000000003,2049.2200000000003, I think so.
2049.2200000000003,2050.2200000000003, I do. I think it's already doing.
2050.2200000000003,2054.2200000000003," It's already had, it's already been like 10 million creatures that have been made."
2054.22,2062.22, I don't see it being the same kind of cultural phenomenon because I don't see what stories you can tell with sport.
2062.22,2067.22, Like compared to specifically girls who play the Sims.
2067.22,2080.22," Like every super Sims fan I've ever known, I have friends who are really into it, they're all girls and they love the domestic narrative that they make with the Sims."
2080.22,2088.22, They love creating situations for people where they're like humiliated or have like a romance and it goes a rye or whatever.
2088.22,2093.22, And those kinds of stories which people relate to so much are not going to be happening in sport.
2093.22,2103.22," The sports stories are much more guy stories, stories about like aliens coming to conquer your planet or like battles or growing bigger and stronger."
2103.22,2116.22, But the conceding that we're stereotyping women here like say you want to say you want to say you want to answer from or find sport in that same way.
2116.22,2121.22, What you just described about the war guys going out and conquering the universe and stuff is totally different than what you said.
2121.22,2124.22," You just had, I mean your yours was the and Jeff's too."
2124.22,2127.22, I mean you guys are like the happy happy joy stuff.
2127.22,2129.22," I mean I can imagine all your characters going like,"
2130.22,2132.22, boobah.
2132.22,2136.22, She like that so is that I mean.
2136.22,2143.22," Well, I don't mean to like divide it into like male and female or like aggression."
2143.22,2149.22, Well I think what what you're getting at in one way is that it's not really at this point in the game's life.
2149.22,2158.22, It is not the kind of sandbox game that the Sims is or that Sims City was really like you know it's very goal oriented in each phase.
2158.22,2163.22, So there isn't this sort of just like breath to you when the phone man.
2163.22,2165.22," Oh, okay get it this time."
2165.22,2166.22, I'll see you at it and get it.
2166.22,2168.22, See you at it is put it on speaker.
2168.22,2169.22, We all want to hear.
2169.22,2172.22, It's not it's not it's not a good time.
2172.22,2177.22, We have your a rather message of day.
2177.22,2183.22, I just want to stroke you.
2183.22,2186.22, You're a very good player.
2186.22,2187.22, Thank you.
2187.22,2189.22, Well Larry actually we were stereotyping.
2189.22,2193.22, And this is for that those two listeners that think I can't contain myself right now I've made a choice.
2193.22,2195.22, I'm like you know what we've been fairly serious.
2195.22,2197.22, We can have like a joking digression.
2197.22,2200.22, So like just chill the fuck out.
2200.22,2203.22, But the last night we were stereotyping.
2203.22,2208.22, Jenner's based on the game played but in a really weird way talking about playing.
2208.22,2210.22, What is this fucking thing called?
2210.22,2211.22, It's a smarty pants every time.
2211.22,2218.22, And there's a tug of war game in it and whenever this one comes up basically what happens is you're fighting over who gets to answer the question.
2218.22,2219.22, So it's called an I know it cards.
2219.22,2224.22, So say for example Melissa buzzes in first and I play my I know it card.
2224.22,2233.22, I don't immediately get to answer we then you know wagered a tug of war and the way it's played is by holding the we-moat sort of like a pin or and and.
2233.22,2242.22, So we're playing him every time like I would just like win that shit in an instant Melissa you like what the hell like what do I got to do.
2242.22,2248.22, And I like looking at her and like it's like that that look at my eye you know and I was like this is what you got to do and it's like.
2248.22,2253.22, Robin Sarah we're having like the same the same discussion because he always loses.
2253.22,2259.22, But then we started like stereotyping the other way and we're like the chat but like you know you got the advantage in the game so it's like.
2259.22,2261.22, Rapid fire button press.
2261.22,2263.22, Yeah.
2263.22,2264.22, So there we go.
2264.22,2266.22, Yeah back to sport.
2266.22,2267.22, Yeah.
2267.22,2275.22," Yeah, but I think it's probably more just what you're saying that like as of right now sports not really that kind of sandbox that would allow you to set up these kinds of situations."
2275.22,2279.22, The people love and just let it roll and see what happens.
2279.22,2282.22, I mean the sandbox is like the creators itself.
2282.22,2285.22," Yeah, but I could definitely see sport getting there."
2285.22,2288.22, I mean the Sims was a long long project.
2288.22,2291.22, I mean it was added to over and over and over again.
2291.22,2301.22, Right. That's what I my suspicion is that is that they will see what people are trying to do now and evolve it from there.
2301.22,2310.22, And I bet that they will sort of maybe like go granular with certain modes like the super popular ones like if it ends up being creatures like everybody plays.
2310.22,2315.22, And they'll be able to tell that now do something to just expand that part out.
2315.22,2324.22," As for the popularity, what I think it could leverage is just this idea that it's customized ability is huge right now."
2324.22,2333.22, I mean whether and also that but not not just the ability to customize things but like little anthropomorphic due to ads and trinkets and stuff.
2333.22,2339.22, I mean if you walk around our floor and you see how many little either like vinyl toy animals and things there are or you know.
2339.22,2344.22," For for girls, you know that's not like the 2D type stuff and that's mostly shame."
2344.22,2351.22, This is this is also that's not like you know America or that's the office of a video game.
2351.22,2357.22, People don't and their offices typically have like their cubicles full of tiny like toys from Japan.
2357.22,2362.22, I use that because it's an example close to hand and we go to Walmart and we walk through Walmart and we go through stationary aisles.
2362.22,2364.22, We go through the kids backpack.
2364.22,2370.22, We go through I mean just the difference you go through the DVD section and look at the kind of like cartoons that have been coming out and stuff.
2370.22,2376.22, I do think I mean that there's a case like yeah in that and it's like urban vinyl or something small group of people do it.
2376.22,2386.22, But I think it is far back is like you know Hello Kitty and shit and Sanrio has been huge for the longest time among mainstream America you know Sanrio shops and malls and Tulsa or wherever.
2386.22,2391.22, But that that that that people like that sort of thing and I'm sure.
2391.22,2398.22, I mean look it also like you what do you think I'm lying what's this now I was laughing at him trying to quietly chew his checks.
2398.22,2400.22, And I'm fucking jealous.
2400.22,2403.22, It's like like a kid eating candy and a church.
2403.22,2405.22," Oh no, just me."
2405.22,2415.22, I could eat such a big handful of that and I remember in church like a lifesaver you basically get it down to just like a tiny razor thing and you keep like showing your friend.
2415.22,2423.22, You're like like really serapticiously just be like all just like show how like basically making your game trying to entertain yourself.
2423.22,2429.22, I don't think I ever made it past like 20 seconds with a lifesaver in my mouth before eating it.
2429.22,2432.22, Yeah you haven't been to the churches I've been to men.
2432.22,2435.22, But you mean you can't resist but to bite in them.
2435.22,2444.22, Yeah this was specifically that church where the incarcerated former pastor would phone in from the prison to talk about because he hit bomb hit abortion clinic and we talk.
2444.22,2456.22, Talk about all the wonderful things and to tell us about the various you know the cycles that and to ask you guys to get some money up to send him some cigarettes.
2456.22,2461.22, Maybe to finish this sport thing I might my point was just that like people like cute little things.
2461.22,2462.22, Yeah sure they do.
2462.22,2468.22, So maybe maybe on on that's right or is a cute little things says one up dot com stronellian.
2468.22,2470.22, No it's a game in which you make cute little thing.
2470.22,2473.22, Yeah go look at the things Alice has made it is all cute little things.
2473.22,2477.22, Yeah yeah my my my my my creatures have been unembashedly cute.
2477.22,2480.22, I haven't made anything very gross.
2480.22,2487.22, Are they all herbivores well even the gross it looks cute right I mean you can have the train of animals like.
2487.22,2496.22, I guess that seems some really ugly stuff but I guess you're true the art style of it kind of keeps everything kind of looking kind of dopey in the cute way or something like that.
2496.22,2498.22, Yeah it's all aggressive.
2498.22,2507.22, It is interesting to see to me like the the way they try to unify everything in sport by controlling like parts.
2507.22,2516.22, And it's like you can really do a lot with what they give you it's sort of like the me's and on on the we except for like way way more options.
2516.22,2520.22, Yeah they give you these standard parts and then it's like you're amazed by what people do with them.
2520.22,2526.22, Yeah that's the thing is that you know like I'll be thinking when I'm using the creator like well.
2526.22,2531.22, Maybe I've kind of hit the limit of what this thing can do and that's so wrong.
2531.22,2537.22, When you go up under the sport PD and you see the stuff people made us like how the hell did they even think to do that.
2537.22,2549.22, Yeah you know that I and I really think that's the cool part of the game is that the tools that they gave for people to make stuff that they can never make you know they they don't have those kind of skills to use.
2549.22,2553.22, And actually professional 3D software that kind of thing is really a cool thing.
2553.22,2558.22, You think to see a market where there's like specialist sport creators that then like try to sell their stuff on email.
2558.22,2563.22, Yeah that sounds with that word I mean can you just yeah don't you just share it.
2563.22,2571.22, I mean you you but you don't have to if you don't want to if you think that you're like the who's the glass blowing dude that you're who Lee and fucker sport.
2571.22,2575.22, No nobody makes face to black me.
2575.22,2581.22, And then you put that shit on you can be like well you find it you know like yeah you probably could do that.
2581.22,2595.22, When I was listening to it right on NPR he was talking about how the creature creator was like they're like their flagship thing in the sense that you know the whole thing they were trying to emphasize on NPR was that he wants it to not be like a teaching tool.
2595.22,2608.22, He doesn't think that sports something to teach you about evolutionary biology or anything like that but he wants it to he's referred to it as a it shouldn't fill a bucket but it should spark a flame to like make people want to learn about like that's his goal right his goal.
2608.22,2610.22, Maybe I'll go pick up that's a bad.
2610.22,2618.22, I mean like if if Carl's second became who he was because he grew up watching book Rogers you know I mean that's about that level and I'm not I don't want to knock that.
2618.22,2634.22, But I mean that's really the level of correlation. I don't own an argument because it could really I mean there's a whole generation of people that grew up in the post where they're absolutely fascinated with space travel with you know and and it had to do with like the pulp sci-fi pulp and right earlier years before that.
2634.22,2647.22, To be fair at his speech at the sport launch event where we'll write said like a big reason that he got into doing it all this in interest in science and all the research he did was because he watched like or he read sci-fi books growing up right and you know he's a thick a year or two older than me and.
2647.22,2663.22, He talked a lot about the you know NASA and stuff on television when when we were boys when you know people are age for boys in the late 60s you know to sing that the you know the landing on the moon was like unbelievable and I mean imagine being.
2663.22,2688.22, I know you know I want to play I want to play a game like sport that's like about evolution but where you have no direct control over the appearance of the species just the only way the only way you do it is by like punishing the animal or like I would have a really long back so all your food is way up here come get it come get it come.
2688.22,2694.72, Kind of a reversing it's for right you can you can design a really long neck and then you can reach the fruit that they did put up there.
2694.72,2715.72, Yeah in the game you would you would control selection pressures that would also be like that would be other creatures that share the ecosystem as well and stuff but like yeah everything you're talking about every just like add some horrible predator just to see like what happened I mean I'm sure that this is something that would be so incredibly difficult to me out you know and I'm sure it's something that they are thinking of at the time.
2715.72,2721.72, Yeah it's time for a candy break right and then I might be time for a real break yes.
2721.72,2725.72, See that says the crew should we take it out of my first way to go out with the candy break before we take a break.
2725.72,2730.72, Richie Churchill yeah the sentence buckets of toxic waste.
2730.72,2733.72, He can you just pass out like good looking candy.
2733.72,2741.72, These were made in Pakistan and there's a warning on it says consuming more than one within a brief time because irritation of the mouth.
2741.72,2744.72, The sense of individual should not consume this project.
2744.72,2746.72, I'm a sense of all that.
2746.72,2751.72, It says 15 seconds your total was 30 seconds your cry baby 45 seconds your toxic one.
2751.72,2752.72, What the hell is it?
2752.72,2753.72, 6 seconds.
2753.72,2754.72, Go go go go go.
2754.72,2756.72, Got it.
2756.72,2758.72, This is not bad.
2758.72,2760.72, It tastes like a penny.
2760.72,2761.72, I don't know.
2761.72,2763.72, Talk to you guys I'll put it now.
2763.72,2764.72, Hell no.
2764.72,2766.72, I'm doing it.
2766.72,2769.72," Oh, God."
2769.72,2772.72, Come on.
2772.72,2773.72, You're blasting.
2773.72,2775.72, He didn't even make it to 15 seconds.
2775.72,2777.72, He's your below a total of.
2777.72,2778.72, I'm not going to.
2778.72,2779.72, I'm past it.
2779.72,2780.72, I'm past it.
2780.72,2781.72, I'm past it.
2781.72,2782.72, I'm half.
2782.72,2784.72, Now I know I'm never eating this shit again.
2784.72,2786.72, What's my not a true about more than you have.
2786.72,2789.72, I'm going to get some real candy.
2789.72,2791.72, I'll be back after a break.
2796.72,2810.72, And we're back.
2810.72,2815.72, Robert is volunteered to eat another bit of toxic waste along with the handful of cheddar
2815.72,2817.72, cheques mix at the same time.
2817.72,2818.72, And call it Simon eating.
2818.72,2821.72, Well he doesn't have a great to have around the dorm.
2821.72,2824.72," Robert, we eat this piece of shit."
2825.72,2826.72, Okay.
2826.72,2828.72," While he's doing that, I have an experimental palate."
2828.72,2829.72, Yeah.
2829.72,2830.72, Yeah.
2830.72,2833.72, So Richie Churchill again gave us the toxic waste.

2850.72,2852.72, gummy and sounds good.
2852.72,2853.72, They're really good.

2859.72,2860.72, They're really good.
2860.72,2864.72, I'm just nervous about trying anything that you specifically give me.
2864.72,2867.72," Like, all go through your collection and also let something."
2867.72,2868.72, But we know what to try this.
2868.72,2869.72, I just want to try this.
2869.72,2870.72, I just want to try this.
2870.72,2871.72, With the toxic waste.
2871.72,2872.72, Yeah.
2872.72,2873.72, He's just the background for us.
2873.72,2876.72, So Robert James from Belfass Northern Ireland.

2934.72,2939.72, Viva la bro diol.
2939.72,2943.72," No, this is not a story."
2943.72,2945.72, I'm losing control.
2945.72,2946.72, All right.
2946.72,2947.72, All right.

2968.72,2969.72, You have Bratidander.
2969.72,2971.72," See, this is Letharban volume."
2971.72,2972.72, One's pretty nice.
2972.72,2973.72, Very nice present.
2973.72,2976.72," And, but I brought down the description of what's in it."
2976.72,2980.72, Findest edition ever offered according to them.
2980.72,2984.72," But anyway, this is one particular item I wanted enough to spend."
2984.72,2987.72, Anything to any of you.
2987.72,2991.72, Color insert showing leaves from the book of Mazarbool.
2991.72,2994.72," Well, does that mean anything to you?"
2994.72,2998.72," No, but even my big ass is laughing at that."
2998.72,3000.72," Whoa, that's a fancy book."
3000.72,3001.72, See what I'm talking about.
3001.72,3002.72, It's like gold.
3002.72,3004.72," That's like, by my fancy."
3004.72,3006.72," Yeah, it's kind of like a Bible."
3006.72,3007.72, It's like an nerd Bible.
3007.72,3010.72, It's kind of like a Bible.
3010.72,3012.72, It's not like a Bible because it is the Bible.
3013.72,3015.72," Anyway, so thanks, good."
3015.72,3016.72, Very nice of you.
3016.72,3019.72," And yet you were upset about your religious sport,"
3019.72,3021.72, Civilization.
3021.72,3022.72, What?
3022.72,3023.72, That's a different one.
3023.72,3024.72, But he doesn't worship a deity.
3024.72,3027.72, He worships a fantasy franchise.
3027.72,3028.72, Exactly.
3028.72,3029.72, It's different.
3029.72,3030.72, Whoa.
3030.72,3032.72," I can't get your grubby fingers off it, Ryan."
3032.72,3034.72, That's what it comes down to you.
3034.72,3035.72, What would it pay?
3035.72,3037.72, What used to be a book is now a fantasy franchise.
3037.72,3038.72, Soiling my book.
3038.72,3040.72," Okay, let's move on."
3041.72,3044.72, I wanted to tell so say thanks to all the people I made it.
3044.72,3045.72, Packs.
3045.72,3046.72, It was now a couple weeks ago.
3046.72,3050.72, But I heard you were kind of Jesus like there while we're on the stop.
3050.72,3054.72, I thought I heard you could just kind of put your hands out and people would touch them.
3054.72,3056.72," There's the whole like when people would ask,"
3056.72,3058.72, What's it like being a pseudo celebrity?
3058.72,3059.72," And it's like,"
3059.72,3062.72, I have to fucking make those answers.
3062.72,3064.72, I go because that's a fucking weird question.
3064.72,3066.72," I also like,"
3066.72,3067.72," I mean, yeah, it's like,"
3067.72,3071.72," Well, I guess it's what it would be like to be a star of,"
3071.72,3073.72," you know, like the real world or something."
3073.72,3075.72," It's said if you weren't, you're only like, you know,"
3075.72,3078.72," one thousand of there, you know,"
3078.72,3079.72," a note right here, whatever."
3079.72,3081.72," But yeah, people there were super cool."
3081.72,3084.72, Like they had a lot of them came bearing gifts to you.
3084.72,3086.72," So if you'll guilty walking away at times,"
3086.72,3089.72," I just have like stuff coming out of my bag out of my,"
3089.72,3091.72, my shoulder bag.
3091.72,3092.72, Very flattering.
3092.72,3095.72, Good stuff from Devon Low from Korea.
3095.72,3096.72, Like banana chips.
3096.72,3097.72, I didn't get to share it.
3097.72,3098.72, I ate it all the one I was there.
3098.72,3102.72," But like it's like basically it's like packing foam, packing peanuts,"
3102.72,3105.72, but they tasted like banana and then some other.
3105.72,3107.72, I found it's great.
3107.72,3109.72, And I didn't know it's upstairs.
3109.72,3110.72," Someone from Australia,"
3110.72,3111.72, I should have brought a steak.
3111.72,3113.72, He gave me a kangaroo nut sack.
3113.72,3115.72," Oh, it's like,"
3115.72,3119.72, it's basically the bow sack of a kangaroo that you can put
3119.72,3120.72, change in or something.
3120.72,3121.72," And I first thought was like,"
3121.72,3124.72," Okay, I'm cool with this because there's no way this is really a kangaroo nut sack."
3124.72,3125.72," And the reason I,"
3125.72,3127.72," the reason I care about that is like,"
3127.72,3129.72," I don't want kangaroos getting killed for their,"
3129.72,3130.72, they're scrooed.
3130.72,3132.72," But then you realize that kangaroos are,"
3132.72,3134.72, they're pie-procured for more than just their scrooed.
3134.72,3135.72," They're various,"
3135.72,3137.72, not only products made out of kangaroos.
3137.72,3139.72," And then novelty products can be made out of kangaroos,"
3139.72,3141.72," doesn't mean it's a feel to be a,"
3141.72,3145.72, but I appreciate the sentiment.
3145.72,3147.72," And I now am the owner of a kangaroo,"
3147.72,3148.72," but not so I can,"
3148.72,3150.72, I can put it in your change in there.
3150.72,3152.72, I've been putting weed in it pretty much.
3152.72,3157.72, Is it making up to put your nuts in it?
3157.72,3158.72, No.
3158.72,3160.72, What?
3160.72,3162.72, Do you get a question?
3162.72,3164.72," I mean, Robert's then you could have like,"
3164.72,3165.72," Take your question, sir."
3165.72,3167.72," And let's figure this out like you're at home like,"
3167.72,3168.72," one of the,"
3168.72,3173.72, we might not be in this nut.
3173.72,3176.72," We were,"
3176.72,3178.72," and also last night,"
3178.72,3179.72," we were talking,"
3179.72,3181.72, I was talking about the size of testies and
3181.72,3184.72, the size of the testies and the size of the testies.
3184.72,3186.72," And you guys thought you and your wife and Tina,"
3186.72,3187.72," and I thought I answered you believe me,"
3187.72,3189.72," but you thought I was making the stuff up as I went,"
3189.72,3192.72," that I seem to know so much about the sexual,"
3192.72,3193.72," sexual,"
3193.72,3195.72, more ballgy and dimorphism.
3195.72,3196.72," Well, don't you remember it?"
3196.72,3197.72," Robert's totally like,"
3197.72,3200.72, like non-glass is moment when we were talking about that fish
3200.72,3203.72, that like slowly attaches to the female.
3203.72,3205.72, And then the fish.
3205.72,3206.72," Okay, let's build it right back."
3206.72,3207.72," All right,"
3207.72,3208.72," because we have two people here,"
3208.72,3210.72, and we're just going to be a different way.
3210.72,3213.72," So, what I was talking about with balls is that generally"
3213.72,3217.72," the larger mammals testicles are the more,"
3217.72,3219.72," like,"
3219.72,3220.72, how do you say it?
3220.72,3222.72," Like, it's not just the more sexual partners"
3222.72,3223.72," that he has because in the case,"
3223.72,3227.72, but like outside of a circumstance like a herum.
3227.72,3228.72," So, for example,"
3228.72,3232.72," if a male gorilla has exclusive access to a set of females,"
3232.72,3236.72," it also have menaceual genitals,"
3236.72,3237.72, compared to other primates.
3237.72,3240.72," Humans, chimpanzees, bonobos."
3240.72,3242.72," And this is because it's like,"
3242.72,3246.72," if they're having intercourse with one of the females in their ham,"
3246.72,3248.72, they have no worry that they're going to be cuckolder
3248.72,3251.72, or that because some other gorilla would have had to beat him
3251.72,3252.72," and fight and he would have caught him,"
3252.72,3255.72, and they would have fought till it chased him off or killed him.
3255.72,3260.72," Whereas in animals that just spread their seed all over the place,"
3260.72,3264.72, there's a great likelihood that the female had already
3264.72,3266.72," just had intercourse,"
3266.72,3267.72," maybe even an hour,"
3267.72,3268.72," minutes before, you know."
3268.72,3269.72, So it's basically like a wall.
3269.72,3270.72, There are more.
3270.72,3272.72, The biggest load.
3272.72,3273.72," And,"
3273.72,3274.72," but it just,"
3274.72,3276.72," it harms race, if you will."
3276.72,3281.72," And then I kind of comment on the side that humans are actually fairly large among primates,"
3281.72,3286.72, which indicates that we're not necessarily as faithful as our society.
3286.72,3287.72, No.
3287.72,3289.72, Wantes to tell us and listen to that.
3289.72,3290.72," But that aside,"
3290.72,3293.72, there's a special case of a certain deep sea fish.
3293.72,3295.72," This happens in a few different types of species,"
3295.72,3298.72," but basically the male is a very, very, very tiny females are large,"
3298.72,3299.72," you know,"
3299.72,3300.72," benthic fish,"
3300.72,3301.72, super exotic looking.
3301.72,3305.72, And the male will attach itself to the female.
3305.72,3308.72," And then eventually it just becomes part of her,"
3308.72,3309.72," her body just absorbs,"
3309.72,3311.72, it absorbs the male.
3311.72,3313.72, Circular Tory system becomes one.
3313.72,3316.72, And then it's just a living sperm sack that hangs on her.
3316.72,3317.72," And Robert actually,"
3317.72,3318.72, I was just one.
3318.72,3319.72, I was just one.
3319.72,3320.72, I was just one.
3320.72,3321.72, I was just one.
3321.72,3322.72, I was just one.
3322.72,3323.72, I was just one.
3323.72,3324.72, I was just one.
3324.72,3325.72," I was like,"
3325.72,3326.72," you're like, you hear that?"
3326.72,3327.72," And you're like, got that sun so such like a horrible type of sex."
3327.72,3329.72," But I wonder if for the male fish,"
3329.72,3332.72," the whole grafting you into the female body,"
3332.72,3333.72," for however long it takes,"
3333.72,3336.72," if that isn't just like one long moment of like,"
3336.72,3338.72," oh,"
3338.72,3339.72," oh,"
3339.72,3340.72, forever.
3340.72,3341.72, I'd be in grafting.
3341.72,3342.72, I'd be in grafting.
3342.72,3343.72, I'd be in grafting.
3343.72,3344.72, I'd be in grafting.
3344.72,3346.72," Oh, listen to myself."
3346.72,3350.72, He was doing this at higher volume than that.
3350.72,3351.72, In a public favor.
3351.72,3352.72," He was a monster,"
3352.72,3354.72, but it wasn't like a nice restaurant.
3354.72,3355.72, It was a bar.
3355.72,3356.72," It was pretty nice, man."
3356.72,3358.72, By Berkeley's in Berkeley.
3358.72,3360.72, But most standards it was nice.
3360.72,3361.72," The other day I was in Berkeley,"
3361.72,3362.72," and I said a cuss word,"
3362.72,3364.72," and someone with me was like,"
3364.72,3366.72, what's wrong with your kids around here?
3366.72,3368.72," And I'm like, they're in Berkeley."
3368.72,3369.72, What the fuck?
3369.72,3370.72, They've heard of it.
3370.72,3373.72, Did they say this is they were stepping over someone shooting up?
3373.72,3374.72," Like,"
3374.72,3377.72," fucking downtown Berkeley is like,"
3377.72,3378.72," yeah, like, yeah,"
3378.72,3379.72, come out of the place last night.
3379.72,3380.72, How many people did we see
3380.72,3382.72, that were like bed and up for the night?
3382.72,3383.72, You're probably getting ready.
3383.72,3384.72," It's like, I've heard of it."
3384.72,3385.72, I've heard of it.
3385.72,3386.72," You know, I mean,"
3386.72,3388.72, I can't deal with the real estate prices around here.
3388.72,3390.72, I just can't bet on your tree.
3390.72,3391.72, Peanut jar.
3391.72,3393.72, I think I plugged my plastic.
3393.72,3394.72, I'm a fan of you.
3394.72,3395.72," Is that the free,"
3395.72,3397.72, I had the free land for a jar at some day?
3397.72,3398.72, I was thinking to...
3398.72,3399.72, No comment.
3399.72,3400.72," I was thinking,"
3400.72,3402.72, how long have you been with your wife forever?
3402.72,3404.72," Like, can we receive a thing?"
3404.72,3407.72, You got some small balls I've been.
3407.72,3409.72," Oh, oh."
3409.72,3411.72, That's why you weren't here on GFW.
3411.72,3413.72, I was wondering about fit and mint.
3413.72,3415.72," Oh, small ball bubble."
3415.72,3416.72, Bubbito.
3416.72,3417.72, They called him.
3417.72,3418.72, So I'm just thinking.
3418.72,3419.72, We have a bunch of questions.
3419.72,3421.72," Yeah, for you, Jeff."
3421.72,3423.72," Uh, for your, since you're leaving."
3423.72,3424.72, Yep.
3424.72,3425.72," And, like, I want to get to those."
3425.72,3426.72, I just also want to say thanks.
3426.72,3427.72, Thanks again to the people at Pax.
3427.72,3428.72, It's at high.
3428.72,3430.72," And like, there were a lot of people that were super interesting."
3430.72,3432.72, And I wanted to get to know them.
3432.72,3434.72," One guy, a particular guy, a really interesting story."
3434.72,3435.72, He lived in DC.
3435.72,3437.72, He got busted for some stuff there.
3437.72,3439.72, But then basically decided who's going to change his life.
3439.72,3442.72, He moved out to Vegas and started this program for troubled youth.
3442.72,3444.72, Super interesting guy.
3444.72,3446.72," But the problem was, is that there's so many different people."
3446.72,3448.72, And everyone's asking questions and stuff.
3448.72,3452.72," Really unnatural way to talk to, you know, to try to basically acknowledge everyone."
3452.72,3454.72, But then follow up.
3454.72,3456.72," Yeah, they can't follow up conversation."
3456.72,3459.72," But so yeah, so all those people, I hope I didn't seem like a dick or anything."
3459.72,3462.72, What was the dumbest question you got?
3462.72,3463.72, I don't want to pick on anyone.
3463.72,3465.72," I mean, like, there's like that most awkward one."
3465.72,3468.72," To be honest, like I was leaving."
3468.72,3471.72," Was it, was it, cannot, can you be my big brother?"
3471.72,3472.72, It was close.
3472.72,3475.72, It was clear that it could be my big brother.
3475.72,3478.72, It was whether or not my boss could free the inside the...
3478.72,3483.72, I'm not even going to go there.
3483.72,3485.72, I like everything in there.
3485.72,3487.72," Let's go on to questions for you, Jeff."
3487.72,3488.72," Yeah, how are you, Wayne handle this?"
3488.72,3490.72, I've got like eight thousand of them.
3490.72,3492.72, I got a lot of questions.
3492.72,3493.72, You don't need a monitor-
3493.72,3494.72, You just have to pick the best I know.
3494.72,3495.72, I know.
3495.72,3499.4199999999996, The thing is that you don't bring in the 50 page and all the web through the
3499.4199999999996,3500.4199999999996, modern area.
3500.4199999999996,3503.06, We have not five minutes of dead science.
3503.06,3504.4199999999996, Is that really the entire thing?
3504.4199999999996,3505.4199999999996," No, not that one."
3505.4199999999996,3508.06, I got some highlighted here.
3508.06,3510.3599999999997, And they do kind of go around a general theme.
3510.3599999999997,3512.06, I've never seen Gaff from that.
3512.06,3513.06," No, this is a Gaff."
3513.06,3514.06, This is one of the.
3514.06,3515.06, Okay.
3515.06,3516.7, We don't print off Gaff.
3516.7,3518.8999999999996," No, there was a Gaff thread too."
3518.8999999999996,3522.3399999999997, But the questions are very much sort of a theme.
3522.34,3527.7000000000003," And I do want to kind of say the same thing, Sean, just said in a way, which is that there's"
3527.7000000000003,3528.7000000000003, no way.
3528.7000000000003,3531.2200000000003," Obviously, I can answer any more than a few of these."
3531.2200000000003,3533.38," And there's like, I don't know, a few hundred of these."
3533.38,3539.02, So I just want to thank everybody for writing in and asking these questions.
3539.02,3540.54, And I want to be able to answer them all.
3540.54,3544.9, I'll try to go online and answer some of these in that thread in writing.
3544.9,3546.98, So I could get to more of them.
3546.98,3550.06," But if I didn't answer your question, I apologize."
3550.06,3552.02, Don't hate me.
3552.38,3557.62," So a lot of them are, you know, why I decided to do this."
3557.62,3560.58, Did I always want to be a game developer?
3560.58,3565.34," And this, you know, so this was my secret dream that I'm finally fulfilling."
3565.34,3571.86, So I think I could probably answer a bunch of those questions kind of all at once if I just
3571.86,3577.34," sort of, you know, lab for a minute or two and just stop me when it's getting boring."
3577.34,3579.3," Also, I did blog about this."
3579.38,3582.5, So a lot of the reasoning why I did this is on the question.
3582.5,3582.98, Do you need the questions?
3582.98,3585.0600000000004, And I'll find some good cover news here.
3585.0600000000004,3586.0600000000004, Okay.
3586.0600000000004,3587.82, But just to go over the old territory in general.
3587.82,3589.6600000000003," Oh, look out there."
3589.6600000000003,3596.7000000000003," No, this was not my secret dream to develop for the Sims or to develop games at all."
3596.7000000000003,3600.26, This just felt like the right thing at the right time for me.
3600.26,3605.1800000000003," We've been over how fucking long I've been at Zif Davis, which is 17 years, which is a long"
3605.1800000000003,3607.6200000000003, God damn time to be anywhere.
3608.62,3612.18," Yes, the end of the magazine did influences for me."
3612.18,3617.8199999999997," That was, you know, I've set up a four and it's no big secret that, you know, was pretty"
3617.8199999999997,3620.74, fucking devastating to me and it still is.
3620.74,3624.18, That was very much what my career was about here.
3624.18,3630.1," So when the magazine closed, you know, I was kind of at a loss, you know, when you're,"
3630.1,3634.38," you know, when you think of yourself as a magazine guy and then you don't have a magazine."
3634.38,3637.86, It really my career changed at that point.
3637.86,3642.58, Then I became a web journalist and it took a sort of a little while for me to get my head around
3642.58,3643.58, that.
3643.58,3645.06," This is, this is what I do for a living now."
3645.06,3646.62, I'm a guy in a website.
3646.62,3648.34, And that's fine.
3648.34,3649.34, That's fine.
3649.34,3651.94," If you're, if you're ready for it, but I wasn't ready for it."
3651.94,3653.3," All the sudden, this was my job."
3653.3,3656.78," And there's a big difference between the, being the editor and chief of a magazine and the"
3656.78,3661.34," group of us who were together every month, putting out this product that we were proud of,"
3661.34,3663.94, and being the editor and chief of a door.
3664.18,3668.38, Which is what I was as the editor and chief of one door of a larger website.
3668.38,3672.38, And it was a door with where we didn't have a whole lot of control over really.
3672.38,3677.1," And that was, you know, I think had we, I hung on."
3677.1,3679.2200000000003, We would have seen some good changes to that page.
3679.2200000000003,3680.46, And I think we still will.
3680.46,3682.1, Or you guys still will get to there.
3682.1,3685.82," But for me, it was time for me to move on."
3685.82,3691.62," And in terms of the sims and then that move, that has a lot to do with Rod Humble, actually,"
3691.62,3695.8599999999997," who was on our podcast, who I, a friend it as a result of that podcast, I decided to"
3695.8599999999997,3698.94," sort of he was a totally brilliant smart, funny guy."
3698.94,3701.46," And, you know, those are the kind of people that we like to be around."
3701.46,3704.7," And when I started thinking about, well, shit, what am I going to do next?"
3704.7,3706.98," I thought, well, who would I like to work with?"
3706.98,3709.8199999999997, And he was right at the top of the list.
3709.8199999999997,3712.18, It wasn't because he's making games.
3712.18,3713.2999999999997, And that's what I want to do.
3713.2999999999997,3716.62, It's just because I just was looking at the people who felt like.
3716.62,3718.2999999999997, I could have been a track on tax in my life.
3718.2999999999997,3719.46, You would have jumped on the back of my head.
3719.46,3720.46, I might have.
3720.46,3723.46, Delivering trash with Rod Humble would be an awesome trash.
3723.46,3724.46, Delivering trash.
3724.46,3727.46," Here's your trash, sir."
3727.46,3731.46," If you like minute, where to?"
3731.46,3734.46," Three bags, right?"
3734.46,3735.46, Here's your shit.
3735.46,3737.46, You got any more seafood?
3737.46,3739.46," Mel's pretty bad, sir."
3739.46,3740.46, Enjoy.
3740.46,3742.46, I'm picking up trash.
3742.46,3744.46, I would have been great with him too.
3744.46,3748.46," No, but the other thing I have a question on top of that, which is,"
3748.46,3751.46, do you feel like you had to go into development?
3751.46,3758.46, Because there's just not anywhere for a guy of your stature in the whole writing about games thing to go.
3758.46,3761.46," Well, like, are there just no options for the server?"
3761.46,3762.46," Yeah, I do."
3762.46,3764.46, And I would take out the of my stature part.
3764.46,3767.46," Well, someone who spent 17 years doing it."
3767.46,3768.46," Yeah, right."
3768.46,3769.46, Okay.
3769.46,3770.46, Yeah.
3770.46,3771.46, Like the guy that worked at McDonald's for 17 years.
3771.46,3772.46," Oh, oh."
3772.46,3773.46, Just don't watch taking a dude.
3773.46,3774.46, Go to Arby's.
3774.46,3775.46," Oh, I got shit."
3775.46,3776.46, Now I'm here.
3777.46,3779.46," That's, I got turned down to where the fuck that's."
3779.46,3782.46, That's what I'm doing for a year's in a row.
3782.46,3783.46," Yeah, I mean, what do I do?"
3783.46,3785.46, I walk into IGN and I'm at her chief there.
3785.46,3787.46," And then day one, I got some clowns saying, like,"
3787.46,3790.46," like, I gotta get paid to you, tap on the PC coverage."
3790.46,3792.46," I'm supposed to be going, fuck."
3792.46,3794.46, It's just what I just got away from.
3794.46,3798.46," So, you know, I mean, and, and, but the truth is that,"
3798.46,3800.46, and I really feel this way.
3800.46,3803.46, And I'm biased because I spent most of my adult life here.
3803.46,3807.46," And I feel like for, you know, every other thing about that we have"
3807.46,3810.46," problems with, you know, with, it's if Davis and the money and all that,"
3810.46,3813.46," that just in terms of the staff and the content we do,"
3813.46,3817.46," you know, I feel like it, for me personally, it is the best."
3817.46,3820.46," So, where would I go that it would be more satisfying,"
3820.46,3823.46," just in terms of the people I work with in terms of, you know,"
3823.46,3824.46, the creative energy.
3824.46,3827.46," Like, it just, it just, I felt like it was going to be a step down"
3827.46,3829.46, if I did the same thing anywhere else.
3829.46,3832.46," So, I really did feel like there was nowhere else for me to go."
3832.46,3835.46," Yeah, I want you to consider this before we go on that,"
3835.46,3837.46," imagine two,"
3837.46,3841.46," a freshman or what, what refuge management specialist to be kinder."
3841.46,3845.46," Yeah, had like a podcast where they refuse, yeah,"
3845.46,3846.46," we're, you know, it's a refuse."
3846.46,3847.46," Sorry, refuse."
3847.46,3848.46," Yeah, and they,"
3848.46,3850.46," you know,"
3850.46,3852.46," just our,"
3852.46,3853.46, our natipod can.
3853.46,3855.46," Yeah, they go around and like, they're just like,"
3855.46,3858.46," bring pot to town like you, they pull up to this house."
3858.46,3860.46," And they like, they just start talking about like the,"
3860.46,3862.46," the, the, the, the, the, the diapers that they know they're like,"
3862.46,3863.46," they're like, they're like, they're all shaking on this one."
3863.46,3865.46," And they talked about this and all here's like old man,"
3865.46,3867.46," someone says, and his fucking dogs are out."
3867.46,3870.46, And I wish I could put a plate of broken chicken bones and sign
3870.46,3872.46, out here and he fucked me up.
3872.46,3874.46," I just, I just, I don't know,"
3874.46,3876.46," you know, like, that would be a great podcast."
3876.46,3879.46, It might be a future career choice.
3879.46,3881.46," So, so, you know,"
3881.46,3883.46," game development wasn't the dream, but it's, you know,"
3883.46,3886.46," and we hear a lot and we see on message boards like,"
3886.46,3888.46," oh, another guy who just sold out and he's going to do this,"
3888.46,3890.46," you know, looks smithed,"
3890.46,3891.46, it's brine into hard did this.
3891.46,3893.46," And it's not because I don't think,"
3893.46,3896.46," I don't know if it was a case in, with them,"
3896.46,3899.46," but with me, it's just, this is the obvious place to go."
3899.46,3901.46," It's not, it's not the place that I was dying to go."
3901.46,3904.46, It's just that if I want to be in a creative field where I get to
3904.46,3907.46," write and I get to work on, you know,"
3907.46,3910.46," left brain, create a project."
3910.46,3912.46," Well, this is where I have the connections."
3912.46,3914.46, This is where I know people.
3914.46,3916.46," If I could go write movies and be in a movie studio,"
3916.46,3917.46, then maybe I do that.
3917.46,3919.46, But this is the one that is available to me.
3919.46,3921.46, So that's why I'm doing it.
3921.46,3922.46," They're settling, man."
3922.46,3923.46, I'm picturing it.
3923.46,3924.46, I'm not settling.
3924.46,3925.46, I'm very happy.
3925.46,3926.46, I'm very happy.
3926.46,3929.46, Our management like a deciding that we should have no more podcast with
3929.46,3931.46," people that work for video game companies,"
3931.46,3933.46, because it just seems like we're all being head hunted by
3933.46,3934.46, people that we meet.
3934.46,3936.46," Well, that's another question."
3936.46,3937.46, My god.
3937.46,3939.46, So that I didn't get head hunted.
3939.46,3940.46, I didn't get head hunted.
3940.46,3941.46, I actually contacted Rod Humboldt.
3941.46,3942.46," What was that, Sean?"
3942.46,3943.46, What did I say?
3943.46,3944.46, What did I say?
3944.46,3945.46, What did I say?
3946.46,3948.46, I was talking about how it sucks as you're leaving.
3948.46,3949.46, I'm serious about that.
3949.46,3951.46," We need to address that, right?"
3951.46,3952.46, Right.
3952.46,3953.46, I guess we should address that.
3953.46,3956.46," Like, I mean, the brodo as we know is over with you gone."
3956.46,3958.46," I mean, we're going to let's get tender with you right now, Jeff."
3958.46,3961.46, You're the greatest boss that I've had.
3961.46,3963.46, And I'm seriously going to miss working with you.
3963.46,3965.46," Not I mean, the podcast has been fun,"
3965.46,3967.46, but just on day to day basis.
3967.46,3969.46, And it sucks as I have stitcher going.
3969.46,3972.46," I'm happy for you, though, because I think you're doing the right thing."
3972.46,3974.46, And then I can tell that you're excited and change is good.
3974.46,3975.46," Thanks, man."
3975.46,3978.46," But yeah, but for those of us, like, I mean, we're seriously going to miss you."
3978.46,3980.46, I am definitely going to miss being here.
3980.46,3984.46," I mean, if we're going to share and care now, you guys have been in this."
3984.46,3988.46, I've been in awesome group of guys who work with this.
3988.46,3992.46, This podcast has been the most fun part of working at Zif Davis.
3992.46,3993.46, I have to say.
3993.46,3995.46, You've just answered a question on our list.
3995.46,3996.46," Well, it is true."
3996.46,3999.46," And you know, and I could say it honestly, especially because we sort of like,"
3999.46,4002.46," worked up to this being as fun as it is, right?"
4002.46,4006.46," I mean, we had a lot of growing pains getting to this."
4006.46,4010.46, And we sort of got pushed into it quite a long while ago.
4010.46,4013.46," I mean, we've been enjoying it for a while now, but at first it was like, we have to do what?"
4013.46,4015.46," Like, I didn't even know what that word was."
4015.46,4017.46," Yeah, it sounded so douchey upon a podcast."
4017.46,4018.46, Yeah.
4018.46,4020.46," Like, it sounded like it's just like the kind of thing that a douche comes up with."
4020.46,4022.46," And they said, it's down."
4022.46,4023.46, And the press record.
4023.46,4027.46," And I remember the whole time, I would be like, well, glad someone out there that's not going to want to"
4027.46,4029.46, fucking listen to us is already decided.
4029.46,4030.46, They didn't want to fucking listen to us.
4030.46,4037.46," Yeah, I remember like when you asked me to come on like three or four times for the day."
4037.46,4040.46," And I was like, I was like, yeah, man."
4040.46,4042.46," Yeah, just whenever."
4042.46,4043.46," Yeah, come on."
4043.46,4044.46, Your podcasts.
4044.46,4050.46, And it's been great to tap people like Anthony come along and and add to it in their own way.
4050.46,4056.46," Totally expanding the brodo universe, the song and dance, the hot wearing put that head back on."
4056.46,4059.46, That was actually like before I worked as if long before.
4059.46,4063.46, And I was working as shitty job at a lab like GIFT of your idea was like the one thing I always listened to.
4063.46,4065.46, And I didn't even have a good PC at the time.
4065.46,4070.46," And I was one of those people that posted on the boards like, I don't even play PC games, but I listened to it and you."
4070.46,4073.46, And now he really has a job and the PC.
4073.46,4075.46, And listen to the channel.
4075.46,4076.46," Yeah, double you ran here."
4076.46,4077.46, And thank you.
4077.46,4079.46," You know, can be like Anthony, go, you go."
4079.46,4081.46, That was something that was cool.
4081.46,4084.46, Also to hear packs so many people were of that set.
4084.46,4086.46," Like, I wasn't a PC gamer."
4086.46,4087.46, I am now.
4087.46,4091.46," And we heard that so much, but that was like when you have someone telling to your face, it's like it made it really like."
4091.46,4097.46," Yeah, people actually, I mean, we do get how much better if it could have been like we convinced someone to recycle or something like."
4097.46,4100.46," Like, it's like, wow, you know, but it was still cool."
4100.46,4105.46," Wait, we could have done GIFW cure AIDS or cast, but instead we did GIFW."
4105.46,4112.46," Not necessarily the people I've talked to there, but people at packs though, I would have rather that they, before they became PC gamers."
4112.46,4115.46, I'd rather they learn to watch their fucking hands after they go to bathrooms.
4115.46,4119.46," Because the entire time I was there, I swear I saw no one leave that place."
4119.46,4120.46, Stop it that scene.
4120.46,4123.46, And I know it's nothing like chaos and hands on and stuff there.
4123.46,4125.46, And I did get sick when I was at past.
4125.46,4127.46, So you're saying you're getting stink fond of it.
4127.46,4128.46," And it could be like, how are you shit?"
4128.46,4131.46," You know, where I'm saying like, oh, dude, it's because those people, they're watching their hands."
4131.46,4134.46," But like, I think it's because those people, well, right."
4134.46,4137.46," Yeah, but you know what, you don't have to leave the building for that because,"
4137.46,4142.46," Yeah, we got to say I am not going to miss the, you know, half inch of urine by the urinals."
4142.46,4145.46, So it's there every day from people fucking missing.
4145.46,4147.46," Well, it's that I don't know how you miss that."
4147.46,4149.46, It's bad. And sometimes the urinals miss.
4149.46,4150.46," Guys, you're spraying on the floor."
4150.46,4154.46," You know how you miss, you're looking at your mother fucking iPhone while you pay."
4154.46,4156.46, God damn it.
4156.46,4161.46," If I see another person looking at their iPhone and an inappropriate situation, I'm going to punch somebody."
4161.46,4165.46, We need what they have. They start testing in some European country.
4165.46,4169.46," Maybe Germany, but they etch a fly into the urinal."
4169.46,4177.46, And what happens is they they tested they found that there's like almost no more spray over because every guy tries to piss the fly down into the drain.
4177.46,4179.46, What about that game?
4179.46,4188.46," There was, there was a urinal like game that he was selling to bars where you, you went like drive a car by peeing in like certain directions in the."
4188.46,4192.46," Yeah, that could fail because that's kind of like someone someone."
4192.46,4193.46," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
4193.46,4194.46, It's trying to make sure it's hurting.
4194.46,4195.46, I'm sorry.
4195.46,4196.46," No, but someone who's like insecure."
4196.46,4197.46, That's my leg asshole.
4197.46,4201.46," So this is gay watch this and they're like, like, they'll just deliberately crash."
4201.46,4202.46," Like, oh, look, I crashed."
4202.46,4203.46, Like they didn't.
4203.46,4204.46, You know what I'm saying?
4204.46,4205.46," Like someone who would just be like, yeah."
4205.46,4206.46, Yeah.
4206.46,4207.46, So I'm not going to miss that.
4207.46,4209.46, But I am going to miss you guys.
4209.46,4211.46, And I'm going to miss the listeners a lot.
4211.46,4214.46," And, and again, my inbox is overflowing."
4214.46,4216.46, I can't possibly answer everybody who wrote me.
4216.46,4221.46," And, but I'm really, truly grateful and honored to get that kind of reception."
4221.46,4222.46, It kind of blows me away.
4222.46,4223.46, I blog about this too.
4223.46,4226.46," It is, it's a very surreal feeling."
4226.46,4232.46, I think all of us in the sort of have felt that at times when you get that kind of mail.
4232.46,4236.46," And you're just doing your job, you know, which is what I've been doing."
4236.46,4241.46, And so I feel very lucky to get this kind of response on my weaving.
4241.46,4244.46, And certainly didn't ever expect to be here this long.
4244.46,4250.46," But I guess after a while, you've just sort of, you just sort of are."
4250.46,4254.46," Well, I just want to say as a reader, I think the thing that's going to suck"
4254.46,4260.46," is that for me, I really enjoyed reading the perspective of someone who was older."
4260.46,4262.46, I'm not a young man myself.
4262.46,4263.46, I'm married.
4263.46,4268.46," It was nice to read someone who has a family who obviously, like, is good to their family."
4268.46,4270.46, You got a daughter.
4270.46,4271.46," She sounds cool, smart."
4271.46,4275.46," And yet you still play games and you're, you know, a decent guy."
4275.46,4278.46," And you're not like, you know, a total fuck-away or something."
4278.46,4283.46," I like to, it was nice to read the perspective of someone who, of someone who had grown up with"
4283.46,4287.46," games and was still doing it and it wasn't, you know, going out the window."
4287.46,4289.46, And I don't think there's much of that around.
4289.46,4295.46," So I did sort of like, I realized as I hung on longer and longer and the age gaps"
4295.46,4297.46, started getting lighter.
4297.46,4300.46," I sort of realized, like, oh, wow, all of a sudden I have become kind of like,"
4300.46,4304.46," what Johnny Wilson was when I started, which was like the older dude who sort of"
4304.46,4311.46," representing, you know, and that was, you know, that's my lesson to you young men."
4312.46,4314.46, You can't even have your family.
4314.46,4319.46," You never became the one that was like, you things used to be so much better and different."
4319.46,4320.46," I mean, there was never time."
4320.46,4321.46, Right.
4321.46,4322.46, Yeah.
4322.46,4323.46," Well, I honestly don't feel that way."
4323.46,4325.46, I feel mostly like we're living in the best of times.
4325.46,4326.46," I mean, I do."
4326.46,4327.46, What it comes to gaming.
4327.46,4329.46, Here's what it comes to gaming when it comes to the internet.
4329.46,4333.46," I mean, it's fun and unbelievable that advantages of people have now for the things they can do."
4333.46,4336.46, Here's a question that ties into that from Doom with Serverbot.
4336.46,4337.46, Yep.
4337.46,4342.46," Basically, what are the major changes in industry that you experienced over those 17 years in your career?"
4342.46,4343.46, Yeah.
4343.46,4344.46, You don't have to outline them all right.
4344.46,4345.46, Right.
4345.46,4346.46, One that you think is getting the 3D.
4346.46,4348.46, I'll do it in terms of everything.
4348.46,4349.46, It's in color now.
4349.46,4354.46," Well, I'd say it certainly in terms of PC gaming."
4354.46,4360.46," It's the commercial, the commercialization of it and the mass popularity of it."
4360.46,4366.46," I mean, when I started, PC gaming was really just kind of coming out of a much more hobby."
4366.46,4371.46," I mean, before I started at CGW, it was very much."
4371.46,4376.46, This was the geeky nerdy hobby that we did as geeks and nerds.
4376.46,4384.46, And there wasn't even sort of a pretense at that time that this was going to be something that was going to be embraced by mainstream media.
4384.46,4390.46, We wouldn't have ever fathomed that there'd be a game like the Sims or World of Warcraft or ever that millions of people were playing.
4390.46,4392.46, We knew this was like our thing.
4392.46,4396.46, We're going to play these gold box RPG games because we're dorks.
4396.46,4398.46, And so that was kind of our thing.
4398.46,4407.46," And as it related to our job in the press, what that meant was, you know, we were a sort of group of hobbyists writing to ourselves."
4407.46,4409.46, And we only had to please ourselves.
4409.46,4413.46," And because there was no internet, we were all there were for everybody else too."
4413.46,4415.46, So we sort of owned that space.
4415.46,4418.46, That was kind of the amazing thing back then.
4418.46,4422.46," You really felt like, okay, we're like the magazine of authority on the,"
4422.46,4423.46, I know I'm just popping.
4423.46,4426.46," I won't tell, I won't tell, I won't tell, I won't tell."
4426.46,4428.46," Yeah, pretty much."
4428.46,4429.46, It was the gaming in this act.
4429.46,4430.46, Exactly.
4430.46,4436.46," And then, you know, the increasing popularity of PC gaming and gaming in general, which of course is a great thing."
4436.46,4437.46, We want them to succeed.
4437.46,4439.46, We want the game companies to succeed.
4439.46,4443.46," And I think it's what we're seeing to this day, not just some PC gaming but a cross-sabord."
4443.46,4445.46, I think it's why we're seeing magazines fall.
4445.46,4451.46," It's that the game companies are getting so popular and gaming is getting so popular that they don't need,"
4451.46,4454.46, they don't need a niche media anymore.
4454.46,4457.46, They don't need hobbyists' pubs because they've got entertainment weekly.
4457.46,4462.46," They don't need a 300,000 circulation magazine because they've got a 5 million circulation magazine."
4462.46,4466.46," So in some ways, the success of gaming, I feel is kind of killing the gaming media."
4466.46,4468.46, I don't mean that in a total gloom and doom way.
4468.46,4471.46, Like it's going to go any time in the near future at all.
4471.46,4472.46, I don't think it is.
4472.46,4474.46, And I think that there's plenty of things about that.
4474.46,4475.46, I hope you'll be able to eat it.
4475.46,4476.46, I hope you'll be able to eat it.
4476.46,4477.46, I hope you'll be able to eat it.
4477.46,4478.46, I mean that's like a two-part thing.
4478.46,4483.46, I mean there's people that have to embrace both the man and embrace it.
4483.46,4484.46, Yeah.
4484.46,4485.46, I mean we always say about this.
4485.46,4486.46, It's pressuring you.
4486.46,4489.46, Like if you can't create your content based on the fact that you were the first to see it.
4489.46,4493.46, And constantly reminding people again and again that you were the first to see it.
4493.46,4494.46, You have to do something different.
4494.46,4496.46, But then people have to buy that something different.
4496.46,4497.46, So go back and forth.
4497.46,4498.46, That's right.
4498.46,4500.46," You'll hear people say, well, we don't want to do it because we're like, look at edge."
4500.46,4501.46, They have so few subscribers.
4501.46,4506.46," It's like really, I mean, the people really did warn it that they don't."
4506.46,4510.46," I mean, maybe not everyone knows how to get that magazine or other things that are like it."
4510.46,4512.46," Well, my advice would be."
4512.46,4514.46, And we've talked about this amongst ourselves.
4514.46,4519.46, It's that what you want to do then is you want to like drill down and just go back to that.
4519.46,4521.46, What it was back then in 1992.
4521.46,4524.46, You want to just talk to the people who actually want to spend money on a gaming magazine.
4524.46,4525.46, You don't fuck around.
4525.46,4527.46, You actually just be serious about it.
4527.46,4530.46," You know, cinema has film comment on other magazines."
4530.46,4534.46, It doesn't mean that a gaming magazine has to be hard core serious.
4534.46,4539.46," But that you just say, okay, we can't compete with time magazine when they put spawn in the cover."
4539.46,4540.46, We can't compete with entertainment weekly.
4540.46,4547.46," But we can talk to the 300,000 dudes who were so nerdy, they would spend seven dollars on a gaming magazine every month."
4547.46,4548.46, Like talk to those people.
4548.46,4551.46, Don't pretend that you're a mainstream magazine.
4551.46,4553.46," You know, just like be hardcore about the hobby."
4553.46,4559.46," You know, I'm really going in depth on articles, which is what I thought we were doing at the end of GFW magazine,"
4559.46,4562.46, which is why I was so frustrated when that got closed.
4562.46,4566.46," You know, because it felt like our whole strategy was fucking lecturing."
4566.46,4567.46," Well, it was so cranky."
4567.46,4571.46," Man, it was going to say, well, that's why GFW closed because he didn't want that."
4571.46,4573.46," But I mean, we don't think that's the case."
4573.46,4574.46, I don't think that's the case.
4574.46,4575.46, I don't think that's the case.
4575.46,4576.46, Right.
4576.46,4579.46, And it wasn't that the magazine was closed down because there weren't enough subscribers.
4579.46,4582.46," You know, like GFW had a strong subscriber base."
4582.46,4587.46, And the reasons it closed had much more to do with the state of Zif Davis's finances than it did.
4587.46,4589.46, And it had status and all that.
4589.46,4591.46," And there's other parties involved too, right?"
4591.46,4594.46," If you're buying ads right at them, I mean, you want to be, I mean, you have your own notion."
4594.46,4596.46, Everyone's got these different ideas.
4596.46,4597.46, And it's good now.
4597.46,4600.46," And then to see someone, I'm going to name check."
4600.46,4605.46," I talked to Ryan Jones, you know, he works at PR, does PR for 2K."
4605.46,4607.46, And I take two.
4607.46,4614.46," And he was really honest about saying, just like, yeah, we don't, we don't know everything."
4614.46,4616.46," I mean, even on their side, I mean, they're trying to figure out what's the,"
4616.46,4618.46," what do people want, what's the best way to reach people?"
4618.46,4621.46, How many different types of people are there to reach and stuff like?
4621.46,4625.46, I definitely think there's a place for the gaming media.
4625.46,4629.46, And I think that this side again is like the one that's onto something really well.
4629.46,4636.46," I think the guys, it games videos are amazing in terms of like the one up show and the kind of content that you're,"
4636.46,4643.46, that you're just not going to see elsewhere because what they're doing is they're creating something that's coming from their own brains.
4643.46,4646.46, They're not just like shoveling out screenshots or whatever.
4646.46,4648.46, I think that's what we need.
4648.46,4652.46," That's what the gaming, how the gaming press is going to succeed in the long haul."
4652.46,4655.46," And the thing that I would love to see, which I mean, I see like,"
4655.46,4662.46," cropping up around the Brodieu, which is so impressive to me, is just cultivating like a sense of community and seeing."
4662.46,4663.46, Yeah.
4663.46,4667.46," Like, like, this is like a certain kind of sub culture and like, welcome to the club."
4667.46,4668.46, Yeah.
4668.46,4672.46, We want to talk about this stuff and we want to hang out with you guys and meet people that are interested.
4672.46,4674.46, And things like this.
4674.46,4676.46, And I think that's what I'm sort of getting at it.
4676.46,4679.46, That's what it was like back in the old days of CGW.
4679.46,4682.46, It felt like here we're in an extended meeting of a club here.
4682.46,4685.46, And I think that's when it works best here as well.
4685.46,4688.46," On the club, no, I put up my Twitter today."
4688.46,4693.46," Someone remembers name, someone did a painting of Yaddle, a pilot that is milking herself."
4693.46,4694.46, No way.
4694.46,4695.46, Yeah.
4695.46,4698.46, I was way way way.
4698.46,4700.46, Fuck you.
4701.46,4703.46, I can't help it.
4703.46,4705.46," No, I'm totally to say everyone sees it."
4705.46,4709.46, It definitely is a painting you have to look at like for like 10 seconds before your brain registered.
4709.46,4711.46," So it's kind of like, I'm getting mad at those here to like,"
4711.46,4714.46," Oh, you can never see it."
4714.46,4716.46, Is the milk green?
4716.46,4717.46," No, it's white."
4717.46,4718.46, It says go off.
4718.46,4719.46," Clop, Nancy."
4719.46,4720.46, You got any more questions for me?
4720.46,4721.46," Yeah, I won't go through this."
4721.46,4725.46, I'll also write a same getting back because you always said that your I remind you of spacoli and then also
4725.46,4729.46, Tina started asking you recently like if I'm high every single day.
4729.46,4730.46, I thought that's the way.
4730.46,4732.46, So did you tell her that you are?
4732.46,4734.46, That's the only correct response.
4734.46,4737.46, It's like you're like the only thing is just to like to.
4737.46,4739.46, You're like not just gay.
4739.46,4741.46, You're like the gayest person they've ever had.
4741.46,4742.46, She thinks I'm high.
4742.46,4744.46," I'm like, fuck it ripped out my mind."
4744.46,4746.46," You're just like, what?"
4746.46,4748.46, What did she say?
4748.46,4749.46, Um.
4749.46,4750.46, Tucks.
4750.46,4752.46, What are you going to miss Jeff?
4752.46,4755.46, What are you going to miss most about being on the press side and what are you looking
4755.46,4756.46, for?
4756.46,4758.46, I'm going to miss you on the development side.
4758.46,4759.46, Okay.
4759.46,4762.46, That comes from complex the chimney suite with the heart actually he's not the chimney
4762.46,4763.46, suite.
4763.46,4764.46, We've got to go.
4764.46,4765.46, That's our random tag.
4765.46,4766.46, So it's complex.
4766.46,4767.46, Let's see.
4767.46,4769.46, I'm going to miss a total access to all games.
4769.46,4771.46, I'll be honest about that.
4771.46,4773.46," I mean, let's let's face it, you know."
4773.46,4774.46, We get fucking everything.
4774.46,4775.46, I've been playing.
4775.46,4777.46, I actually beat already.
4777.46,4778.46, I beat pebble lights.
4778.46,4780.46, The sequel of pebble.
4780.46,4781.46, It's not out yet.
4781.46,4782.46, So that's a nice shit.
4782.46,4784.46," Yeah, say you didn't even know about it."
4784.46,4786.46," You, you, of all the way."
4786.46,4787.46, Why didn't you like let us know.
4787.46,4789.46, You had it wasn't a transferable code.
4789.46,4790.46, I tried to share it.
4790.46,4791.46, You just sitting in your office.
4791.46,4792.46, Hold it now.
4792.46,4793.46, It's on my blog.
4793.46,4795.46, I said in between packing and playing pebble lights.
4795.46,4797.46, It's not like I was hiding it.
4797.46,4799.46, I probably publicly said I was playing.
4799.46,4800.46, Okay.
4800.46,4801.46, So see.
4801.46,4802.46, That's an example.
4802.46,4806.46," But I mean, you know, we were in a very privileged position."
4806.46,4807.46," I mean, let's face it."
4807.46,4808.46, If you're a gamer.
4808.46,4813.46, What better places there to be than in a place where people are asking you to play their games
4813.46,4814.46, all day every day.
4814.46,4821.46," We had an amazing, have I had you have an amazing job in that way to have all that."
4821.46,4826.46," And to get that kind of overview, not strictly from the selfish I get to play this game now,"
4826.46,4831.46, but also just watching everything being made and watching everything develop over time.
4831.46,4836.46, And actually sometimes even getting to have input on what's happening is such a cool thing.
4836.46,4837.46, I'm very much going to miss that.
4837.46,4842.46," And now you're trading it for the ability to access a coffee machine, which can make 10,000"
4842.46,4844.46, different kinds of coffee.
4844.46,4847.46, And like a snack room filled candy.
4847.46,4848.46, Exactly.
4848.46,4849.46, Interpretation.
4849.46,4850.46, Yeah.
4850.46,4851.46, Yeah.
4851.46,4852.46, Yeah.
4852.46,4854.46," I mean, and answer that question seriously on the other side."
4854.46,4857.46, I'm just mulled looking forward to just being involved.
4857.46,4858.46, Respect.
4858.46,4859.46, Yeah.
4859.46,4864.46, I'm looking forward to the new to the new to the new to just actually getting to do something.
4864.46,4866.46, I'm going to walk in that for a stay and not have any fucking clue.
4866.46,4868.46, I won't even know where the bathroom is.
4868.46,4871.46, Like how awesome is that for a guy who's been like a fucking fixture for almost two decades?
4871.46,4875.46, And I'm going to be the new guy and I have a lot to learn and that part really excites me.
4875.46,4877.46, You're going to have crazy dreams now.
4877.46,4879.46, You're going to get to work the first day and the whole night.
4879.46,4881.46, You're going to be waking up in the middle of the night.
4881.46,4882.46, Dreaming about work.
4882.46,4884.46," Oh, I love things you're thinking about."
4884.46,4886.46, I'm already anticipating somewhere around the second or third day.
4886.46,4888.46, I'm going to have some kind of breakdown.
4888.46,4890.46, I'm going to be sitting in my cuber office.
4890.46,4891.46, Whatever wherever I'm sitting.
4891.46,4892.46, I don't know what it is.
4892.46,4893.46, Calling my wife going.
4893.46,4894.46, I got a little wide.
4894.46,4896.46, I can't do it.
4896.46,4897.46, I already know.
4897.46,4899.46, You should call into the brodea.
4899.46,4901.46," Oh, I should have a live call."
4901.46,4902.46, You can pick me up.
4902.46,4903.46, Yeah.
4903.46,4904.46, Please let me come back.
4904.46,4906.46, Do you have enough?
4906.46,4907.46, I didn't know how good I had it here.
4907.46,4908.46, There's something a lot of people will.
4908.46,4910.46, I can get more page views.
4910.46,4914.46, A lot of people want to know if you're going to be able to do podcasts and stuff.
4914.46,4915.46," No, and then."
4915.46,4917.46," Well, I think so."
4917.46,4918.46," I mean, I want to."
4918.46,4919.46, I guess I'm.
4919.46,4920.46, I'm hesitating because of that.
4920.46,4921.46, Yes.
4921.46,4922.46, I don't know.
4922.46,4923.46, EA is going to let me or not.
4923.46,4924.46, So we'll see.
4924.46,4925.46, They let Rod humble.
4925.46,4927.46, They got something better for you.
4927.46,4928.46, I know.
4928.46,4930.46, So I know that works at EA LA.
4930.46,4933.46," When he drives the work, he brings a bag of his dirty laundry."
4933.46,4935.46, And when the person the card.
4935.46,4936.46, Lot of tenant parks his car.
4936.46,4937.46, Hulk.
4937.46,4938.46, I take his laundry when he gets down for the day.
4938.46,4939.46, He's got a bag of fresh laundry.
4939.46,4940.46," Oh, my."
4940.46,4942.46, I don't know if they do that.
4942.46,4943.46, Wow.
4943.46,4944.46, Go on.
4944.46,4945.46, I didn't see anything about laundry service.
4945.46,4946.46, I know there's a full gym.
4946.46,4947.46, I can join for free.
4947.46,4950.46, And like it's it seems like a pretty nice place.
4950.46,4951.46, If we blend out the work.
4951.46,4954.46, Sometimes they have coax in the machine as if you get a paper.
4954.46,4955.46, Yeah.
4955.46,4956.46, I don't know.
4956.46,4957.46, I don't know.
4957.46,4958.46, I don't know.
4958.46,4959.46, That's pretty good.
4959.46,4961.46, Your first day you should just go in with a.
4961.46,4964.46, Bug big like bucket of laundry and just leave it with your set.
4964.46,4965.46, Your set.
4965.46,4966.46, Or is my law.
4966.46,4967.46, My boss is desk.
4967.46,4968.46, Yeah.
4968.46,4970.46," If anybody calls, I'm doing yoga."
4970.46,4971.46, Yeah.
4971.46,4973.46, I'm looking forward to that.
4973.46,4976.46, I'm looking forward to actually having to work all day.
4976.46,4977.46, You know.
4977.46,4978.46, Has it both been sitting there.
4978.46,4981.46, Or maybe I could try that strategy at EA just put my feet up on the desk.
4981.46,4982.46," Well, this is awesome."
4983.46,4985.46, We want some playpaggle.
4985.46,4987.46, That's how you get into man.
4987.46,4988.46, You're.
4988.46,4989.46, Yeah.
4989.46,4990.46, You're.
4990.46,4991.46, You're.
4991.46,4992.46, You're.
4992.46,4993.46, You're.
4993.46,4994.46, You're.
4994.46,4995.46, You're.
4995.46,4996.46, You're.
4996.46,4997.46, You're.
4997.46,4998.46, You're.
4998.46,4999.46, You're.
4999.46,5000.46, You're.
5000.46,5001.46, Do you.
5001.46,5002.46, Yeah.
5002.46,5003.46, I will see.
5003.46,5004.46, If you.
5004.46,5008.46, We ask him if he knows that his name is pseudo anonymous for small cock.
5008.46,5009.46, You mean.
5010.46,5015.46, If you go to their area.
5015.46,5017.46, And last one one later.
5017.46,5021.46, I fancy a robber.
5021.46,5023.46, Just call that a Wenn.
5023.46,5025.46, slices another isROAD.
5025.46,5039.4, Travel with
5039.4,5041.099999999999, I interviewed that guy once he was nice.
5041.099999999999,5043.299999999999," Do your bosses, do you know bosses know that they're"
5043.299999999999,5045.9, been occasions when you've had to be taped into your office
5045.9,5046.7, to finish?
5046.7,5048.799999999999, They don't know about my lack of deadline making
5048.799999999999,5050.5, and we won't talk about it here in public.
5050.5,5051.099999999999," Oh, okay."
5051.099999999999,5052.299999999999, I found out soon enough.
5052.299999999999,5054.099999999999, You didn't have one of those annoying interviews
5054.099999999999,5056.799999999999," where they're like, so are you the type of person you"
5056.799999999999,5060.599999999999, turns in your work at day before or the day of your deadline?
5060.599999999999,5062.5," No, they were very nice in a new season."
5062.5,5065.5, And they probably should have asked me those kind of questions.
5065.5,5067.599999999999," But yeah, they'll find out soon enough."
5067.599999999999,5069.099999999999, Quickfire questions.
5069.8,5072.3," Yes, your favorite bill of an underground album."
5072.3,5075.1," Probably loaded, which I know isn't really the most"
5075.1,5076.900000000001," politically correct answer, but it's mine."
5076.900000000001,5078.700000000001," Or the first one, I'll get you a brand of Nico."
5078.700000000001,5082.1, Favorite Bob Dylan album?
5082.1,5084.1, I'm going to go with John Wesley Harding.
5084.1,5084.5, Wow.
5084.5,5086.3, Blond on Blond closed second.
5086.3,5086.5, Okay.
5086.5,5089.1, And your favorite album by Bruce Springfield.
5089.1,5090.1, Springfield?
5090.1,5093.1," That's because of an old, the old,"
5093.1,5094.6," okay, Doc, that's on the edge of town."
5094.6,5098.900000000001, That's an inside joke for old time GFW listeners.
5098.9,5100.099999999999," So old, I don't even remember."
5100.099999999999,5100.599999999999, I don't know.
5100.599999999999,5101.4, You don't remember?
5101.4,5102.9," I was like, I said it."
5102.9,5106.4," I somehow, you mix up, yeah."
5106.4,5107.4, What does he springs?
5107.4,5107.9, Or what?
5107.9,5108.9, That's not a cool.
5108.9,5109.4, It's cool.
5109.4,5109.9, It's cool.
5109.9,5110.4, It's cool.
5110.4,5110.9, It's a cool spring.
5110.9,5111.9, It's not a little.
5111.9,5112.4, Something happened.
5112.4,5113.4, I know what is that other guy.
5113.4,5115.4, That's someone that got any mic that.
5115.4,5116.4, Whatever.
5116.4,5117.4, I move on.
5117.4,5118.4, All right.
5118.4,5119.9," Well, I'm still getting some."
5119.9,5121.4, I'm going based on the ones that you highlighted.
5121.4,5124.4, I'm assuming those are the ones that you felt comfortable.
5124.4,5126.4," There's a, they were all good questions."
5126.4,5128.9," No one, you had a couple requests for one last angry ran."
5128.9,5130.9, Is there anything you can get worked up about all of a sudden?
5130.9,5131.9," Oh, God."
5131.9,5133.9," Other than, don't get me started."
5133.9,5134.9, Yeah.
5134.9,5136.9, I need to not burn any bridges here.
5136.9,5139.4," You know, I'm leaving just fine."
5139.4,5140.9, I'm leaving just fine.
5140.9,5143.9," You don't, I got out before they threw me out."
5143.9,5144.9, That was my goal.
5144.9,5148.9, I beat him.
5148.9,5149.9, There you go.
5149.9,5150.9, There you go.
5150.9,5151.9, I'm scared to find.
5151.9,5154.9," I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't want to."
5155.4,5160.9," I do our, um, no, let's just say that when you quit a job and the first thing you find"
5160.9,5164.9," that is they are not replacing you, then your suspicions that you're position with"
5164.9,5167.9, probably superfluous are probably correct.
5167.9,5171.9, So I'm thinking I got out of just some time.
5171.9,5173.9, That job was just made for you.
5173.9,5175.9," Well, in to some extent, it probably was."
5175.9,5176.9, Right.
5176.9,5180.9," I mean, they didn't want to lay us off after the magazine closed, which was very kind of"
5180.9,5181.9, them.
5181.9,5182.9," Of course, had they laid me off."
5182.9,5183.9, I would have had some pretty nice severance.
5184.9,5188.9," And some nice long days at the beach, but that's a different story."
5188.9,5191.9," But, uh, yeah."
5191.9,5196.9," They, they, they made these positions for us and I don't know how necessary they"
5196.9,5197.9, all were.
5197.9,5199.9," This is a, um, a chance to pimple your blog."
5199.9,5202.9," So, and as if you'll still post on one up and then they also want to know what"
5202.9,5204.9," are, what are your favorite moments from the broodio?"
5204.9,5205.9," Oh, God."
5205.9,5207.9," Um, I have favorite moments."
5207.9,5210.9," That one podcast we had a little while ago, where we were all in, in"
5210.9,5212.9, hysterics for forever was.
5212.9,5213.9, Y'all.
5213.9,5215.9, Awesome podcast was that the y'all podcast?
5215.9,5216.9, That was probably the best.
5216.9,5217.9, So it was recently Robert.
5217.9,5218.9, Yeah.
5218.9,5220.9," Robert got us with his, uh, got the guy right."
5220.9,5221.9, Yeah.
5221.9,5223.9," Um, from a galaxy far far away."
5223.9,5224.9, Yeah.
5224.9,5226.9," And my, uh, I am going to still blog."
5226.9,5227.9, I started in the new blog.
5227.9,5229.9," I've, I've already posted twice."
5229.9,5230.9, I made myself do it right away.
5230.9,5232.9, So I wouldn't procrastinate on it.
5232.9,5237.9," So it's up at, uh, the Jeff Dash Green Speak at blog spot.com."
5237.9,5239.9, And if that's too hard to remember on the one up blog.
5239.9,5241.9, I have a link to that.
5241.9,5243.9, So I am still going to be blogging.
5243.9,5245.9," I'm not going to be blogging for one up because, you know,"
5245.9,5247.9, I don't work for one up anymore.
5247.9,5249.9, I don't have to get them clicks anymore.
5249.9,5250.9, So there you go.
5250.9,5251.9, You do a similar thing.
5251.9,5253.9, I'm done with that.
5253.9,5254.9," Um, and also it's just not right."
5254.9,5258.9," I mean, they'd have to take me out of the editor-box base and then I go into the general pool."
5258.9,5260.9," I'm out of sort of a, you don't have tips."
5260.9,5262.9," So you'll, can I get clicked down there?"
5262.9,5263.9, Exactly.
5263.9,5266.9," Can I point out that though Anthony, the microphone is at eye level."
5266.9,5268.9, I can indeed hear much crunch.
5268.9,5269.9," Yeah, what are you at?"
5269.9,5271.9, The sound is going on here.
5271.9,5272.9," Yeah, much too."
5272.9,5273.9," I'm like Robert, man."
5273.9,5274.9, Yeah.
5274.9,5275.9, I thought you're going to ask me something.
5275.9,5278.9," It's strangely addictive about the, I believe you."
5278.9,5281.9," So you wait, the URL you just mentioned, like,"
5281.9,5283.9, Does somebody else already have green speak up?
5283.9,5286.9," Yeah, some freaking doids with some, like, some out of the out."
5286.9,5289.9, It's either like an out green span thing because that's like a word used for him.
5289.9,5290.9, It's green speak.
5290.9,5291.9, That's how he talks.
5291.9,5293.9, It's got to be like an environmental thing.
5293.9,5295.9," Then there's a, yeah, there is one there's environmental."
5295.9,5296.9," So yeah, Jim Jerks."
5296.9,5297.9," Yeah, so what I said."
5297.9,5298.9, What did I say?
5298.9,5300.9, What is the earth atleast?
5300.9,5302.9," That's, that's, there are some games coming in."
5302.9,5306.9," And if you want to like keep going through those and if any, okay stuff comes up, like,"
5306.9,5307.9, we can go back and forth.
5307.9,5308.9," That's, that's cool."
5308.9,5310.9," Yeah, let's move on because we do have other."
5310.9,5312.9, Anthony recently wrote a preview for Demi God.
5312.9,5313.9, We both saw it here.
5313.9,5315.9, I saw it again at packs.
5315.9,5319.9," And I'm upset because I think that the, the bait is now out and we didn't get in by."
5319.9,5322.9," It's even though I just Taylor himself promised he would, he would hook me up with it."
5322.9,5324.9, Maybe he's heard our spacey rant.
5324.9,5326.9, Maybe he seemed pretty cool.
5326.9,5330.9," This was, I definitely talked to him after that and he seemed like he, he didn't."
5330.9,5336.9," Yeah, I don't, I don't think he was concerned about about the rant or the reviews or."
5336.9,5340.9, So Demi God break it down.
5340.9,5344.9, It's another one of those games where like they're looking for something to call it.
5344.9,5347.9," I think Chris Taylor has been calling it, um, what was he saying?"
5347.9,5350.9," And action, it's more, what is he saying?"
5350.9,5353.9," I forgot he's like, he's like an action strategy game."
5353.9,5354.9, I think is what he described it as.
5354.9,5358.9," And I looked at it more as like, it's closer to real time tactics."
5358.9,5360.9," I mean, ultimately the name is not going to matter."
5360.9,5365.9," And so far as you look at it is like, if you, if you used to playing RTS games, you'll see it."
5365.9,5366.9, And it will seem familiar.
5366.9,5370.9, It's at the different tiers that rather than controlling the entire army and building up the units and stuff.
5370.9,5374.9," You're control of a single unit, a single heroic unit."
5374.9,5377.9," Um, and there's an exception to that that will get to you."
5377.9,5380.9," But, um, so these are the Demi Gods from the title."
5380.9,5383.9, They're aided them and they're divided along two camps.
5383.9,5386.9, And they're called assassins and others that are called generals.
5386.9,5392.9," And the assassins that they've been showing so far, um, the big root character that they've showed over and over again looks kind of like a giant."
5392.9,5394.9," It looks kind of like, you know, the characters muscle man."
5394.9,5397.9," I know there's like some Japanese name for it that people prefer to call it, but fuck them."
5397.9,5398.9, It's a muscle man.
5398.9,5400.9, And there's like a guy made of bricks.
5400.9,5402.9," You know, he's like a giant tower man."
5402.9,5403.9, It kind of reminds me of that.
5403.9,5404.9, It's like a tower battle with legs.
5404.9,5406.9, It kind of looks like the last boss in Shadogla.
5406.9,5407.9, The glasses have seen.
5407.9,5408.9, Yeah.
5408.9,5410.9," So like in this case, what happens is you have this board."
5410.9,5413.9," You can have up we we've every time we've seen it, it's been 3v3."
5413.9,5414.9, Yeah.
5414.9,5420.9," So, um, you're basically just trying to work your way across this map and they're different lines of battle on lanes that you can go through."
5420.9,5423.9, And you have these what they call creeps and they're just like automatically.
5423.9,5427.9," They're spawned by some, you know, procedural thing that or some rule set rather than just says,"
5427.9,5429.9, You're going to these are going to come out at this rate.
5429.9,5430.9, And they just they help you.
5430.9,5433.9, You don't direct them or command them or anything and they just go out and help you.
5433.9,5435.9, And you've got control over certain powers.
5435.9,5436.9," You know, you can stop things."
5436.9,5444.9, The rook can uproot these towers that sort of channel energy across the map and then relocate them and get certain abilities doing that.
5444.9,5447.9," It gets upgrade so that there's like archers that appear in the shoulders and are, you know,"
5447.9,5453.9," Raining arrows down on the enemies and catapults or trebuchets and stuff appear on some of the other,"
5453.9,5456.9," You know, towers that he's got on his body."
5456.9,5459.9," And for me, so far."
5459.9,5465.9," The problem is is that I mean, I think the draw would be that if you're intimidated by the seeming complexity,"
5465.9,5469.9," even RTS, like here you go, you'd one unit, you could do that, anyone can do that."
5469.9,5476.9," But then the loss is that for me so far, it doesn't seem like it's going to be all that fun to just take that one unit."
5476.9,5481.9, And order it to be on people or wait for it's super power to recharge and do those.
5481.9,5484.9," Because that starts to sound a lot like a lot of MMOs, you know,"
5484.9,5490.9," But instead of imagining MMO world, you're just trying to work across the side of a map and take over their base,"
5490.9,5492.9, Break down their towers and stuff.
5493.9,5496.9, And so like let's stop there and get your take on that Anthony.
5496.9,5498.9, I know you seemed to like that aspect a bit more.
5498.9,5500.9," Yeah, I thought it played in a lot of ways."
5500.9,5504.9," It kind of like a, it was more akin to like a Diablo game,"
5504.9,5506.9," Like a point in click action, except that,"
5506.9,5510.9," Instead of just fighting like mobs on one side like in Diablo,"
5510.9,5513.9, It was like you're running around with an army of your own mobs.
5513.9,5516.9," And since you couldn't command them, you had to pay attention to the way they moved."
5516.9,5519.9," Because if they were all moving in on a tower, they can't do it on their own,"
5519.9,5522.9, So they need you to go in there and help support them.
5522.9,5524.9," Or if the enemy enemy god comes,"
5524.9,5526.9, It's obvious that you have to like go there.
5526.9,5529.9," And if you were playing with like other players,"
5529.9,5532.9," Since there's usually like on the 3v3 we saw there was 3 lanes of travel,"
5532.9,5535.9," You could like coordinate so 2, you move up one channel,"
5535.9,5539.9," You know, and like then they would have to coordinate obviously on their side as well."
5539.9,5542.9, So I think the demigods have a potential to have a lot of influence in the battle.
5542.9,5545.9," But like you, I was disappointed with the assassin demigods,"
5545.9,5550.9," And the sense that like for me coming from playing so many like strategy games and stuff,"
5550.9,5555.9, I really like wanted to play more of the general demigods that get control armies.
5555.9,5557.9, I mean supposedly I haven't seen them at all.
5557.9,5560.9," I found out about the current state of that too, and then that had me."
5560.9,5563.9, So the bright size of the game looks fantastic.
5563.9,5566.9," I like the art direction, the maps are super interesting."
5566.9,5568.9," And when you zoom out of these battlefields,"
5568.9,5572.9, There's usually some sort of motif to it or something.
5572.9,5579.9," Like there's the one they call it snake and space, and it's basically just like this statue floating in the vacuum of space."
5579.9,5583.9, And it's a guy holding like a serpent and the serpent is what you actually fight on.
5583.9,5585.9," It's like flat on top, but when you zoom out,"
5585.9,5589.9, It's only then that you see the context of where you're having this battle on.
5589.9,5594.9," But then like you're saying, the promise was that maybe when you play the general side,"
5594.9,5596.9, Things become more interesting.
5596.9,5599.9, And this way you satisfy both types of players.
5599.9,5605.9, That aren't intimidated by the complexity or but or even the people who start simple and then want to graduate to the complexity.
5605.9,5610.9," But actually the way that the generals are set now, the only difference is that the creeps will attack with you."
5610.9,5617.9," You're not deciding which ones are spawned and you can't tell them split over here and here, do a picture movement or whatever."
5617.9,5621.9," They just, if you go to text them where they come with you and assist you."
5621.9,5625.9, And I mean I told Chris that Chris isn't the designer of the game.
5625.9,5628.9, I mean he's you know he's part of what's the situation on this Jeff.
5628.9,5634.9, Well it was being developed out of house and I'm just blanking on the name of the company and I apologize for that.
5634.9,5637.9, It's it's just like it's he brought him in the gas power game.
5637.9,5638.9, That's right.
5638.9,5639.9, So they are he brought this team in to do it.
5639.9,5642.9, And then it's now you know they have a deal with start Arkansas right.
5642.9,5644.9, It's publishing it with this guy.
5644.9,5648.9, Also I mean wasn't he they emphasizing sort of the fighting game aspect of it anyway.
5648.9,5649.9, I mean they're sort of they are.
5649.9,5650.9, This is it.
5650.9,5652.9, It seems that that's the game they want to make.
5652.9,5656.9, I did get some sense from Chris that there's conflict in the studio normal kind.
5656.9,5661.9, I mean sure not nothing to be alarmed over anything that indicates anything that's not normal is happening.
5661.9,5666.9, But there's just a normal disagreement of people that think alike Anthony and I are saying that yeah they probably should be something there.
5666.9,5675.9, And Chris is concerned about well if it seems too complicated what do you do with the message and when I just tried to explain is that like take a game like left for dead for example where.
5675.9,5681.9, It's being shown over and over again in the most you know simplistic and accessible terms your human zombies run at you.
5681.9,5685.9, You fucking blow them up and you get scared or like you pop your fist when you blow bunch up.
5685.9,5689.9, At the same time the game of course we know offers the ability to play on the zombie side.
5689.9,5695.9, It's going to be more complicated and it's going to require total coordination if you hope to succeed or you know.
5695.9,5700.9, And because otherwise you just run out and you get shot once and you die you blow up or something you want to act and concert.
5700.9,5711.9, But that's the part that they're sort of leaving there and I'm saying likewise with the fighting reminds me of a fighting game where you get so caliber and there's characters like Mr. Ruggie there and you can pick that up and play it.
5711.9,5716.9, And then as you keep playing or if you're the person who thinks that that's maybe like doesn't offer you enough range.
5716.9,5726.9, Then you have like voldo characters and IV characters with stance shifts and you know all of these other things and that's also what adds to the ultimate playability is that you just keep going at it.
5726.9,5728.9, You know right you can pick some things up.
5728.9,5738.9, So I was definitely thinking if they can work something out where the generals are closer to you know an RT and RTT or something and then you have like the Diablo style.
5739.9,5742.9, For the others that that might be pretty cool but.
5742.9,5750.9," Yeah, I mean I'm not right in offering anything. I think this death's just that's my concern right now is that maybe it's just not engaging enough."
5750.9,5757.9, So we're going to take another break down right and they're adding very briefly because I think we're almost at a time here.
5757.9,5760.9, Really I was told. Okay so far cry to.
5761.9,5770.9, Or am I meant to say this is that's appropriate for the last GFW every time there's like the big game that's moving far away and we're going to talk about and far far.
5770.9,5772.9, Two days at least yeah you know.
5772.9,5775.9, All right so we'll be back with Far Cry and some final thoughts.
5790.9,5795.9, Can you help it on man. I used to work in this building and computer gaming world and they shut that down.
5795.9,5799.9, Can the Microsoft bought it and they've had a magazine and they shut that down.
5799.9,5802.9, Then it worked on the website and I didn't do a good job.
5802.9,5810.9, So I had to leave and I want to EA and I didn't do a good job there and now I can't afford to feed my family and can you spare a quarter.
5810.9,5811.9, Wow.
5811.9,5813.9, You weren't even taking a reading.
5813.9,5815.9, You can't even spare some peggle review code.
5815.9,5820.9, I haven't been able to read out in the hand but they're playing.
5820.9,5823.9, You didn't even know what to look at.
5823.9,5828.9, Now I'm a peggle teacher and you've got to be specific.
5828.9,5831.9, I peggle is like five bucks and you've got three dollars.
5831.9,5833.9, It's just two cents.
5833.9,5836.9, I'm just gonna get another dollar thirty sur.
5836.9,5840.9, Yeah we're laughing now.
5840.9,5843.9, We'll be crying in five years.
5843.9,5844.9, All right.
5844.9,5846.9, So what else do we do in here?
5846.9,5847.9, That's what we're doing.
5847.9,5848.9, We can talk about Far Cry 2.
5848.9,5850.9, Do we have time or are you guys going to do that next week?
5850.9,5853.9, Because there is in fact going to be next week.
5853.9,5855.9, Is there one more?
5855.9,5857.9, One more video.
5857.9,5865.9, My sense here which for you group of young fellows is that you continue to podcast in some form.
5865.9,5872.9, Because you're a very funny group of guys and I don't think you need me to have a successful podcast.
5872.9,5874.9, I fully believe you can do it.
5874.9,5879.9, You did have done it in the weeks I've been gone so I hope on behalf of the fans.
5879.9,5881.9, I'm playing then that you continue.
5881.9,5882.9, Well some will.
5882.9,5884.9," You know, change is inevitable."
5884.9,5887.9, The Colonel Blake had to leave Mash and they went on.
5887.9,5888.9, They got Colonel Potter.
5888.9,5890.9, Some people never like Colonel Potter.
5890.9,5891.9, Other people loved.
5891.9,5893.9, You guys do the bewitch thing and get a new day.
5893.9,5894.9, Get a new Darren.
5894.9,5896.9, What a hard of green.
5896.9,5898.9, Bring back Darren.
5898.9,5903.9, You were bitching about the fucking the fucking Barney Robah had a different message.
5903.9,5904.9, Get your right.
5904.9,5905.9, Now I'm being a hypocrite.
5905.9,5906.9, That's right.
5906.9,5910.9, I don't know if you guys if that because I was I'll actually alive during the switch.
5910.9,5912.9, So this wasn't on reruns.
5912.9,5914.9, I remember when they switched Barney Robles voice.
5914.9,5916.9, Did they use this sort of hip this voice?
5916.9,5917.9, Hey Fritz.
5917.9,5919.9, And then why was something happen to that guy?
5919.9,5920.9, He got fired or he quit or whatever.
5920.9,5922.9, And then next morning he was kind of like this.
5922.9,5926.9, And I remember the little kid I was like what the fuck did people in the message words go crazy?
5926.9,5927.9, Yeah.
5927.9,5928.9, Holy shit.
5928.9,5930.9, I can't get him in a mess.
5930.9,5931.9, That was a concert.
5931.9,5932.9, Play more.
5932.9,5933.9, Yeah.
5933.9,5936.9, Did you talk about it in the playground at least?
5936.9,5937.9, Oh hell yeah we did.
5937.9,5939.9, Was there any anger?
5939.9,5940.9, I don't know.
5940.9,5942.9, I would be like I like the new Barney better.
5942.9,5943.9, It would be like you know that would be that.
5943.9,5945.9, But there wasn't you weren't like we're going to go fuck in one star.
5945.9,5946.9, They saw an Amazon type.
5946.9,5949.9, See that's what I'm saying everything's better now.
5949.9,5951.9, Everybody can be shit like that.
5951.9,5952.9, We had no voice.
5952.9,5954.9, We were powerless.
5955.9,5956.9, Against the man.
5956.9,5958.9, But those same people in a barbedo.
5958.9,5962.9, The fact that you're not on GFW and that it's not the same for years and years.
5962.9,5964.9, Much as they do for Luke and one up.
5964.9,5965.9, They do.
5965.9,5967.9, And he say any of us are interested in that.
5967.9,5970.9, But let me say two of those fans that after I leave.
5970.9,5974.9," If there is still a podcast and these boys are involved here, you should listen."
5974.9,5975.9, Wait a minute.
5975.9,5976.9, I don't know.
5976.9,5977.9, You like recording.
5977.9,5978.9, Yeah.
5978.9,5979.9, Yeah.
5979.9,5980.9, We're recording.
5980.9,5981.9, I don't know.
5981.9,5982.9, We got the sign.
5982.9,5983.9, So what's in here.
5983.9,5984.9, They would keep listening.
5984.9,5985.9, To you guys talk.
5985.9,5988.9, That sounds a little bit like Hillary Clinton.
5988.9,5989.9, Really?
5989.9,5991.9, Was that a Hillary Street?
5991.9,5996.9, You guys should definitely tune into the GFW radio.
5996.9,5997.9, Yeah.
5997.9,5999.9, They're going to vote for the GFW.
5999.9,6000.9, They're going to listen to the GFW radio.
6000.9,6002.9, They're going to listen to the GFW radio.
6002.9,6004.9, I don't have a podcast at EA.
6004.9,6005.9, Yeah.
6005.9,6006.9, Brodi of this.
6006.9,6007.9, Whatever it's called.
6007.9,6008.9, Yeah.
6008.9,6009.9, Alright.
6009.9,6013.9, And if you are a podcasting still and then I can come back.
6013.9,6014.9, Okay.
6014.9,6017.9, You're appearing on gamers with jobs podcast this week.
6017.9,6018.9," Oh, that's true."
6018.9,6023.9," Barring any difficulty or conflict with my family, gamers with jobs who I've been"
6023.9,6027.9, a guest on a few times and we had Julian Murdoch on our podcast here.
6027.9,6028.9, So we're all good friends.
6028.9,6031.9, I've been invited to appear on their Sunday podcast where I will probably
6031.9,6033.9, Yammer about some of the same shit.
6033.9,6034.9, So let's go.
6034.9,6035.9, This sounds fun.
6035.9,6036.9, Yeah.
6036.9,6037.9, Sounds like fun.
6037.9,6038.9, Yeah.
6038.9,6039.9, Yeah.
6039.9,6040.9, That's good podcast.
6040.9,6042.9, Maybe you got to find up making that garbage man.
6042.9,6046.9," When you're out here begging for Pegal code, I'll let you do my garbage man podcast."
6046.9,6048.9, You mean the one where I deliver garbage?
6048.9,6049.9, You just write a lot of them.
6049.9,6050.9, You've touched you.
6050.9,6051.9, People's trash.
6051.9,6052.9, They were on people's trash.
6052.9,6053.9, We're picking up.
6053.9,6054.9, I think you're really on a something.
6054.9,6055.9," You know, there was something."
6055.9,6056.9, You made a whole career at it.
6056.9,6058.9, They're going to be someone who Bob Dylan's garbage.
6058.9,6062.9, Like a new jersey or someplace that they've figured out of
6062.9,6063.9, it.
6063.9,6064.9," You know, it's like just undiscovered."
6064.9,6065.9, Brilliant material.
6066.9,6069.9, Just press record basically put a recorder in the cabinet of the vehicle.
6069.9,6072.9, And then or actually mic a mic because when they're like hanging off the back and
6072.9,6075.9, I'm sure you get some of the best grumbling when they're actually trying to lift
6075.9,6079.9, and someone put like 50 pounds of center blocks and look in the tree.
6079.9,6080.9, Oh my god.
6080.9,6081.9, It's full of diapers.
6081.9,6082.9, Yeah.
6082.9,6083.9, How are we done?
6083.9,6084.9, No.
6084.9,6085.9," Oh, we're not done."
6085.9,6091.9," Well, this is how like, like, it's where if you want to be done, we're done."
6091.9,6092.9," No, we have to be done."
6092.9,6094.9, I've been looking forward to talking about a parker.
6094.9,6095.9, I know.
6095.9,6096.9, I need one.
6096.9,6098.9, No one else is played it yet.
6098.9,6100.9, So we've seen some of it.
6100.9,6101.9, We like it.
6101.9,6104.9, I've been playing a lot because I have the thing at my house.
6104.9,6109.9, I've been able to basically have unlimited access to an un-final copy.
6109.9,6113.9," You know, so subject to change as we, you should say."
6113.9,6116.9, And definitely liking it so far.
6116.9,6119.9," I mean, to the point where I'm convinced it's a good game."
6119.9,6122.9, And the issue is whether or not it will be great.
6123.9,6128.9," I mean, the most noticeable thing is just the fact that they've taken, I mean, you used to,"
6128.9,6130.9, you remember how much I like crisis when it came out.
6130.9,6131.9, Yep.
6131.9,6137.9, And I was so appreciative of their approach to level design in that it ultimately was on rails
6137.9,6138.9, and some respect.
6138.9,6140.9," But I mean, you could move sideways and backwards so to speak."
6140.9,6143.9, It wasn't just constantly and relentlessly moving you forward.
6143.9,6147.9," And it gave you a lot of, you know, because of that, it gave you a lot of tactical freedom."
6147.9,6149.9," And you felt, you know, that you were someplace."
6149.9,6150.9, And this takes you to step further.
6150.9,6155.9," And basically says, let's arrange the world as though we're just cause or grantive data or something."
6155.9,6159.9, And it's still going to be a first person shooter though.
6159.9,6164.9, And it's still going to remind it's still going to have a lot in common with first person shooters.
6164.9,6168.9, And it's basically not just going to be just cause with the first person camera.
6168.9,6171.9, And there's a lot that you can get from there.
6171.9,6177.9," I mean, the media benefits are that, you know, when you're in this world, you, it's going from level to level."
6177.9,6181.9, And it really develop a sense of continuity and familiarity with the place.
6181.9,6183.9," You develop like, you know, mental map of it."
6183.9,6187.9," After a while, you start to recognize, okay, there's going to be a bend in the road up here."
6187.9,6190.9, I know this and there's probably a patrol here at this time of night.
6190.9,6194.9," Maybe I want to like get out of the vehicle, turn out the lights and go around the bush."
6194.9,6195.9, There's something.
6195.9,6201.9," And just the quality of the environment, the presentation really contributes to that."
6201.9,6202.9, Because it looks so phenomenal.
6202.9,6206.9," I mean, the sun is setting and moving through accelerated cycles kind of like GTA,"
6206.9,6209.9," instead of whatever the speed there is like a half hours, a whole day cycle here."
6209.9,6212.9, It's about four hours per 24 hours.
6212.9,6215.9, And changes on whether a storm will come through.
6215.9,6221.9," And then it's not just that the sky darkens and that it rains, but the wind actually registers in the world with a certain direction."
6221.9,6225.9," And that could have a bearing on the, the, the flammability of that world."
6225.9,6227.9," So, I mean, you know, you throw something."
6227.9,6230.9," You can, you can shoot, see, you're, you're having a gunfight."
6230.9,6232.9, You end up shooting a box of ammo.
6232.9,6235.9, Then the rounds start cooking off and doing their fireworks show.
6235.9,6238.9, And that could set a fire to some tall grass that was beside the box.
6238.9,6240.9, The wind's blowing your way and it's blowing strong.
6240.9,6244.9," The conflict, the, the conflict, the, the, the configuration is going to, you know, envelop you really quickly."
6244.9,6246.9, You could have time as well.
6246.9,6248.9," There's not, and I mean, the flammability is a big part of it."
6248.9,6252.9," You can have just like, you're fighting people and you want to keep distance between you and them."
6252.9,6253.9, Maybe they got shotguns or something.
6253.9,6255.9, And you could put down a fire wall.
6255.9,6256.9, And they're obviously not going to come across.
6256.9,6260.9, Didn't mean suddenly you've got the advantage because you can shoot your rifle through it and throw grenades over it.
6260.9,6264.9," And all, all that seems cool."
6264.9,6270.9," And it's also neat to just be able to have that kind of like, you know, I'm going to go here and I'm going to take this mission."
6270.9,6272.9, Or I'm just going to go explore and see what's up.
6272.9,6277.9, I'm going to just try to climb this mountain and hang light off of it and try to land on a church or something.
6277.9,6282.9," Again, very, grantive, dot-o-like things when what people have celebrated for the longest time."
6282.9,6286.9," The, the drawbacks though that I, I mean, I've only played for about four hours."
6286.9,6289.9," So I can't, you know, conclusively say that any of the stuff is like a,"
6289.9,6295.9," a definite danger and that they're going to be issues when the game ships out and people play through it and it's entirety, but um,"
6295.9,6299.9," in a game like a half-fly for something, you always have this objective."
6299.9,6301.9," I mean, and half-light to it's a citadel."
6301.9,6305.9," It's omnipresent. You see, you're always aware that you have a destination, you're heading toward it."
6305.9,6314.9," Maybe to something, step in halo, you know, you're going to end up on the, the titular halo space station and probably blow it up if it's anything like the des stars or something."
6315.9,6322.9," And, but they have like this, I mean, you do have this sense of, of forward movement and drive and what this game kind of game because it doesn't have it."
6322.9,6330.9," It's more, I mean, it's got an objective, but since you're just crisscrossing the same world and you might not necessarily feel that you are building towards something, you know,"
6330.9,6335.9," I mean, even though you got the continuity, if you go from Savannah to jungle, I mean, you, you've,"
6336.9,6340.9," driven from one ecosystem to another and you've experienced that it's not like,"
6340.9,6345.9," huh, where am I going to be at the next level? I'm going to be underground in antline caves or am I going to be in Russia?"
6345.9,6349.9," You know, call do these caves, and then we back here, then you're going to go off."
6349.9,6354.9," So, you know, that can be an issue. And then the other thing is, is that, and this kind of game, what happens in,"
6354.9,6364.9," since you don't have these scripted set pieces where you're, um, you know, I mean, you can just like really carefully tweak the intensity throughout"
6364.9,6368.9," then, for the entire play experience you say, let's put in a couple of big heavy grunts here."
6368.9,6373.9," I'm trying to draw examples from a bunch of different, so it's not just half life over and over and I talk about that because I,"
6373.9,6377.9," I played it so much, and you know, we're going to have a tank come out here or something."
6377.9,6384.9," And in this game, it's not so carefully orchestrated, and players might decide, I'm not going to have a fight for another hour."
6384.9,6388.9," I'm just going to go on the outback and drive around or something, and then it's going to be a random encounter."
6388.9,6392.9," What that, that means is that the quality of those random counters have to carry the game to an extent,"
6392.9,6399.9," because I mean, if your missions consist of a series of like rating base camps, you know, being, you have to go assassinate someone here,"
6399.9,6404.9," you have to steal something here, acquire this from this base, and it's just going from one place to another and having these fights."
6404.9,6415.9," Those fights better be pretty fucking good. Right now, they are in so far as, you know, dealing with the flames, you know, goes, and everything else, but the AI pretty much stinks."
6415.9,6420.9," They get to, they get fixed that, you know, but right now it stinks, and that's a beta, you're looking at or,"
6420.9,6430.9," that's not a beta, it's just a preview code. Okay. So again, like, you know, totally subject to change, but that's going to be something to watch for."
6430.9,6442.9," Right. You're going to need not confused and wouldn't enemy behavior, but you're going to need interesting stuff, where sometimes they'll do it like, I mean, I had a circumstance where I was, let me get a drink here."
6442.9,6445.9," That's not a drink, that's readable."
6446.9,6452.9," So I had a, like the other thing that's cool about the game is instead of constantly moving forward and fighting, you have the ability to retreat."
6452.9,6458.9," And you see, you have escape phases as well. So if you go to some camp and you strip the hornets and that's kill one guy and you saw, I'm getting in the Jeep and getting out here."
6458.9,6463.9," You have people chasing you, which is something that you don't always get, you know, and call duty or something."
6463.9,6470.9," And that can be cool. I had a part where they shot my truck up it. I thought it was going to overheat to the point that I was like, alright, I'm just going to get out."
6470.9,6477.9, But apparently it wasn't done because I got out and started running and bay people chasing me got in it and used it to run me down.
6477.9,6482.9," It's heating. And that was totally cool. I mean, there's another time where people chasing me."
6482.9,6488.9," In the first time I was like, dude, these people chasing me, like what, what idiots? Because I had RPGs on me, I had a ton of them."
6488.9,6497.9," So I just get out of my car and like shoot him with RPGs and it's just big, dramatic, incredible explosions as they go flying through the like, the African knight and set a fire out into the weeds on, on."
6497.9,6520.9," Yeah, I see the road. I could see it totally working without halfway decent AI just because of the whole Grand Theft Auto idea, which Grand Theft Auto even for, you know, has never had enemies that didn't come across to me like the guys who, you know, pop out of boxes and digitized shooters that you'd play at put put."
6521.9,6529.9," But there's, I would argue from what I played, there's like a great deal more variety in Grand Theft Auto, and in the types of the missions and just the whole thing."
6529.9,6539.9," I mean, the whole, you know, running over random people and I mean, all those different things that go in sometimes you have like an RC mission or the missions to like race your car or something."
6539.9,6549.9," And here, I really don't, I can't say because I haven't experienced the game in its entirety, so I don't know what the true range of mission objectives are, but all the missions have done so far have more of that spend about going to a place having a firefight."
6549.9,6560.9," And getting out and going back. It sounds kind of like more in the vein of crackdown like you go, you're like, you're like, you know, you're making your way to some central point that you got to like fight out the enemies."
6560.9,6566.9," Right. And even in crackdown, though, what's kind of like, will co-op is really important in that circumstance."
6566.9,6578.9," This would have been a fantastic game for co-op. Oh my god, I would have loved it. But, but it's still like the in crackdown you're like, yeah, we're going to jump to the top of this building and play like we're spider manner, the Hulk jumping through the city or something, you know."
6578.9,6587.9," I mean, I could be wrong, we that could be the case, right? Maybe, maybe flying hand gliders is that much fun. Maybe there's like helicopters we don't know about in the game. So far it's boats and trucks, you know."
6587.9,6591.9, And that might totally be the case.
6591.9,6601.9," What else, there's a few other concerns about the game. Because it is drawing from GT it's like it also risk acquiring and inheriting some of like sort of like the defects that are unique to that kind of game."
6601.9,6609.9," And that would be, say your mission to go into Sassnate someone and then terms for completion of the mission or to actually return to the person who gave you it in the first place."
6609.9,6616.9," Now the PC version, you can save anywhere. So it's not a problem, but in the console, you have to be at a safe house to save."
6616.9,6622.9," Well, what happens when you go to the mission, your successful involves a 15 mile drive there on the way back."
6622.9,6627.9," You run into a random troll and then you die. Then you're presented with a situation where you're going to do it again, you know."
6627.9,6629.9, And so those are little things that could happen.
6629.9,6635.9," At first, that was worried about this one thing where you go, it's like a problem with them and most."
6635.9,6640.9," And in the most, if you don't have a quest, you could still go to quest places."
6640.9,6648.9," But it's, and you can still do the same exact thing. Sometimes even with other people, but the game doesn't acknowledge that you've done anything because you're not officially on the quest line."
6648.9,6652.9," Right here, I go out to this giant fort and it's full of people and it's clearly designed."
6652.9,6657.9," I mean, they clearly take time to create this fort because it's going to be a mission at some point."
6657.9,6668.9," It wasn't a mission I was on at the time. So I went cleared out, blew everyone up, rooted through it and tried to find every single thing I could make sure there was like not some, you know, hidden diamonds or something in there."
6668.9,6672.9," And nothing. And it was like, I just know that at some point in the game, that's going to be a mission."
6672.9,6673.9, I'm going to go right back.
6673.9,6674.9, You got to do it.
6674.9,6675.9, Can we remember you guys?
6675.9,6678.9," You know, well, they still be dead."
6679.9,6682.9," Oh, certainly not. I'm sure they'll be that would be really funny."
6682.9,6686.9, They would be cool if they were. If you go back and they had to clear out the fort.
6686.9,6688.9," Wait, go on clearing out the fort."
6688.9,6702.9," So what I was thinking would work in that would be like, I mean, because the game, the game's fiction already assumes that someone has GPS tracking on you, because you get the cell phone calls now and then,"
6702.9,6709.9," you know, no, no, but because when you die, it's an interesting part of the game is that you don't really die the first time that you have these allies and they come in."
6709.9,6725.9," It's like, they just come in out of nowhere, you know, and then they pick you up and you weren't really dead. It's like maybe you had a broken hand and you like it just automatically shows you like setting your fingers in first person pulling out like a nail before between your fingers or yank it up and roll it out of your your leg with the pair of pliers as they're fighting."
6725.9,6730.9," And then you fight with them for like five minutes, but their ability to arrive anytime you're in danger implies that they know where you're at."
6730.9,6735.9," Those same people can say, hey, you're by this fort. There's a motherfucker that needs dying there. Why don't you go do this right now."
6735.9,6741.9," Well, it's, it's a kind of world that is. It's like harsh. I mean, it's, it's just like savage people, you know, it sounds good."
6741.9,6743.9, It's a world in which motherfuckers need dying.
6743.9,6746.9," Yeah, I mean, it's like people people people get to round the world."
6746.9,6747.9, They're a far box.
6747.9,6758.9," There's this war between two factions going on and people from all mercenaries and hired guns from all around the world and with different interests and opportunities there to make a buck off it, you know, something or another off selling walking through diamonds are there."
6758.9,6767.9," And those are the people that are, you know, I definitely think if that was on the box more people would buy it. I think because motherfuckers need dying."
6767.9,6771.9, I'm trying to come in December.
6771.9,6774.9," I think that's something I did commercial, you know."
6774.9,6777.9," Yeah, I think you should work on that somehow and work that into a sinset."
6777.9,6782.9, Same three because motherfuckers need dying.
6783.9,6786.9," Moving to staircase from the pool, you know, lotting people in their rooms."
6786.9,6793.9," You're the only wanting year that knows about the new Sims expansion pack, which is Sims automatic weapons."
6793.9,6795.9," Yeah, that's going to be my goal."
6795.9,6797.9, Because motherfuckers need dying.
6797.9,6799.9," Mr. Humble, I have a great idea."
6799.9,6802.9, I like to see who's girls will love them.
6802.9,6807.9," Yeah, we know we sell this to teenage girls. We need to start selling it to like the female democrat."
6808.9,6814.9, You can go and you pinch it like shaking. You know your sister Sims world that she spent so much time in.
6814.9,6817.9, And then it's just like Bobo and they like the trailer starts.
6817.9,6820.9," Yeah, shit, people bodies fly."
6820.9,6823.9, It's like the boy running through like murdering his whole family.
6823.9,6832.9," The little brother who used to torture the Barbie doll, kidnapped and destroyed his sister Sims family."
6832.9,6833.9, And they could sell that.
6833.9,6834.9, And go on and stuff.
6834.9,6837.9," Yeah, and then they could make it happy because you're basically clones a copy of their world."
6837.9,6842.9," It's not like the sole existing one. So that way he can do it and feel like that without making you know,"
6842.9,6845.9, Susie cry because her world's been destroyed.
6845.9,6847.9," Right. And they can have a version for her, for her."
6847.9,6852.9," Then like she can go in and like do whatever, you know, make all of like his like super protagonist."
6852.9,6853.9, Put into that.
6853.9,6854.9, Put into that.
6854.9,6860.9, I think it should be on a USB stick and little brother can just go into the computer.
6860.9,6862.9," Just plug it in, start killing."
6862.9,6863.9, Perfect.
6863.9,6867.9, So it's strictly in USB.
6867.9,6870.9," Yeah, like it's just like you're coming. You're hacking to her game."
6870.9,6874.9, I don't know if there's any like basis for that in reality.
6874.9,6877.9," I saw it on TV, but I think we can make it happen."
6877.9,6878.9, USB.
6878.9,6879.9, There's a lot of not a few.
6879.9,6881.9, Like the classic one like we need more RAM.
6881.9,6882.9, We need more RAM.
6882.9,6884.9," And then you hear like did it, did it, put someone in."
6884.9,6885.9, We've got it.
6885.9,6886.9," Yeah, some people."
6886.9,6887.9, Couple key strokes in on the computer.
6887.9,6888.9," Yeah, it's like there you go."
6888.9,6898.9," So, um, the game's also got this like really elaborate world editor that for multiplayer."
6898.9,6900.9, That seems pretty cool to use.
6900.9,6909.9, I think people really like forge for Halo 3 that allowed you to basically place weapons and bounce pads and change items vehicle spawned in such.
6909.9,6911.9, And then here's like a true proper world editor.
6911.9,6917.9," But the difference is that, I mean, importantly, it seems really easy to use and to use in a way."
6917.9,6920.9, Where the results are good.
6920.9,6928.9," Um, so like if you don't, if you want to be the sort who specifically plants every tree and every bush and every rock and you go through with a texturing tool and you textured this amount,"
6928.9,6931.9, you want to transition so you put a creek bed in.
6931.9,6933.9, These kind of plants are on the side.
6933.9,6934.9, I don't want any.
6934.9,6936.9, So basically if you're a professional landscape.
6936.9,6937.9, Right.
6937.9,6943.9," If you're a professional landscape or like someone who you want to maybe you're thinking about making levels at some point, you know,"
6943.9,6953.9," it's a really accessible way to try or you could just take, you know, this procedural tool put in say like, hey, I want this and you change the size of the brush could just be enormous."
6953.9,6955.9, I'm just going to coat all this landscape in it.
6955.9,6958.9," But then you're like, hey, that might look too shitty."
6958.9,6969.9, So I can you just change a few other variables and it will be like only apply this to slopes that are like this grade or something because then that way you don't have hills that look that have like trees growing off and it's just like entirely.
6969.9,6970.9, It's just like entirely.
6970.9,6977.9," So you're saying like you know, you've got like the tree brush and you paint across the country setting you can define some rules like, yeah, but don't put them on rocks."
6977.9,6978.9," Yeah, exactly."
6978.9,6979.9, Don't put them on slopes.
6979.9,6982.9, And it will already do a nice job of randomizing and stuff.
6982.9,6983.9, Yeah.
6983.9,6985.9," Based on the type of jungle or whatever, like you don't put the audio in."
6985.9,6988.9, So like the appropriate types of like bird sounds and stuff like that.
6988.9,6993.9," These guys are these guys are making the game or like obsessed with all this procedural simulation stuff, right?"
6993.9,6998.9," I mean, I looked at Far Cry like a year ago or a half a year ago and everything that they were wanting to tell."
6998.9,7007.9," I was like all the crazy or procedural, like simulation stuff they had going for like how the world knows where to grow grass and trees because you can chop it all down."
7007.9,7008.9, Right.
7008.9,7009.9, Exactly.
7009.9,7010.9, Yeah.
7010.9,7011.9, Those are the same sorts of things.
7011.9,7012.9, Yeah.
7012.9,7013.9," Like a riverbed, say you put in a riverbed."
7013.9,7014.9, Very easy.
7014.9,7017.9, You just take the tool draw a line right through same same thing as a road or something.
7017.9,7020.9, Throw another pass over with the texturing tool and it just kind of like randomizes.
7020.9,7025.9, So it's not this uniformly deep creek bed and then you go on yet another tool.
7025.9,7035.9, All this takes like just a couple of minutes and say put this put this texture and these sorts of assets on any part of the map that's like five feet below.
7035.9,7041.9, See the equivalent of sea level in there then boom the creek bed's got its stuff and you don't have to worry about it appearing somewhere else.
7041.9,7042.9, And that seems fun.
7042.9,7044.9, And what I think people are going to do is.
7044.9,7050.9," I mean, though they'll do some interesting things and first it's I just imagine like just shitty unbalanced maps will proliferate."
7050.9,7054.9," This is a norm anytime a map editor, professional ones like source when it came out."
7054.9,7057.9," You know, and gimmick games, but those can be fun too."
7057.9,7062.9, So like say you just make this giant flammable world or whatever with key areas and you throw everyone in it.
7062.9,7064.9, So you put high winds and it's randomized.
7064.9,7071.9," So the next thing is like basically running through just this giant burning field of tall like elephant grass, but still trying to fight each other or something."
7071.9,7073.9," Maybe that's a shitty example, right?"
7073.9,7075.9, But someone could do it.
7075.9,7080.9," Then you know, I was kind of speculating people were probably going to say, I mean, there's only certain kind of games you could imitate."
7080.9,7085.9," And in this case, you probably could make a lot of you could do far cry two versions of COD popular COD maps."
7085.9,7090.9," The games are like similar enough, you know, it's not like Halo or something where they're like really different and they're inside."
7090.9,7093.9," And um, because he's using the buildings and stuff."
7093.9,7096.9," And then after that, people could probably have fun just like figuring out."
7096.9,7101.9," Cool ways to set things up, you know, we're like bringing stuff that just doesn't fit with the world at all."
7101.9,7107.9," Like, can you build a McDonald's and have to get all the assets are basically ones that they're taking from the game."
7107.9,7119.9," So there's like a range of stuff in there. I mean, there could be industrial works and like, you know, colonial churches and, you know, this kind of stuff like that and down to just like really city shacks and stuff and then just open environment."
7119.9,7122.9, And I hope you could put the animals in multiplayer.
7122.9,7132.9," That will be pretty cool because there are scenarios, you know, like a clenhawk and was telling me he's a creative director for the game that, you know, he's had, you know, the best case scenarios when you have anecdotes when you play these games."
7132.9,7147.9," Like, this I did this and this happened kind of like, you know, the one I gave about being chased and in his case it's like, he, all he learns these guards and they start summoning all this help and the jeeps are coming in and right when they come in like one of them like this buffalo or will the beast just jumped out in front of one of them."
7147.9,7159.9," And so it hit that and boom, send the truck flying and kill the animal or another time we're like, you know, you're trying to sneak up somewhere and gazelle see you and they run and then that ends up learning the AI so then they go out to a search to see what the hell cause that."
7159.9,7172.9, So I mean that would be pretty interesting if you can put those if you can put the animals in multiplayer games to course everyone's just going to like then make the map works like nothing but 50 buffaloes and middle of like 10 and then everyone's got this a launchers.
7172.9,7174.9, That sounds great.
7174.9,7175.9," Yeah, that's okay."
7177.9,7178.9, True.
7178.9,7180.9," Oh, true."
7180.9,7181.9, It's getting sad.
7181.9,7184.9," So yeah, if we just keep talking it can't end."
7184.9,7185.9, Our time is coming.
7185.9,7188.9," If we can't talking Jeff Kelly, you guys know,"
7188.9,7189.9, we'll do a fellow roster.
7189.9,7191.9, These make like good shakers.
7191.9,7193.9," Okay, not really."
7193.9,7196.9, You want to eat some more toxic waste Jeff.
7196.9,7200.9," No, I really don't want to go out by vomiting."
7200.9,7205.9," Well, what do you what's your final message before you start hoarding yourself out of 50 other podcasts."
7205.9,7206.9, You're resting.
7206.9,7210.9," It's not only on one more, those game was game results."
7210.9,7211.9, Let's let everyone know.
7211.9,7213.9," Hey, where you're joystick wherever you're at."
7213.9,7214.9, You want Jeff on?
7214.9,7216.9, I'm in the agent now.
7217.9,7218.9, I can hook you up.
7218.9,7220.9, I know it's Skype ID.
7220.9,7224.9, Now I'm going to quickly run and have things to say.
7224.9,7227.9," So, and I'm going to have to move on to my actual."
7227.9,7228.9," Yeah, isn't worse."
7228.9,7230.9, So I started in two weeks.
7230.9,7232.9, What are you doing until then?
7232.9,7233.9, Fucking around.
7233.9,7238.9," Yeah, you're going to just, you have like a book you want to read or something you want to do."
7238.9,7239.9, You just got like a lot of stuff.
7239.9,7240.9, I started talking about.
7240.9,7241.9," Yeah, he's already reading."
7241.9,7243.9, It's another one of those like with the blood bodies.
7243.9,7244.9, We're up to my waist.
7244.9,7248.9," Is I way through the slain, something cork at corn, piece of wood?"
7248.9,7251.9," Well, it's not quite that good."
7251.9,7260.9," No, I'm reading Steve Erickson's Malazon series if you're a fantasy based on his presumably on his"
7260.9,7261.9, D&D campaign.
7261.9,7262.9," Okay, yes."
7262.9,7267.9," It started the D&D campaign, but in his defense he did it."
7267.9,7268.9, This is on the back.
7268.9,7270.9, Based on a round of the campaign.
7271.9,7273.9," I don't say that, but if you Wikipedia, you'll find out."
7273.9,7275.9," But you know, he did go to Iowa, writers' workshop."
7275.9,7276.9, He does know he's shit.
7276.9,7277.9, That's a writer.
7277.9,7280.9," It's a 10 volume series and each volume is like,"
7280.9,7281.9, Fatter than the last.
7281.9,7284.9, I bet people loved workshopping his stuff there.
7284.9,7285.9," Yeah, I honestly."
7285.9,7288.9, Is this guy a barbarian or is he a barbarian?
7288.9,7291.9, I'm just not finding these stuff.
7291.9,7292.9, I'm just not finding these stuff.
7292.9,7294.9, I know how a few about what you're doing.
7294.9,7297.9," I'm sure he, I'm sure he befuddled the workshop group."
7298.9,7300.9, It was based on a D&D campaign.
7300.9,7305.9," And there are times when I'm reading it and I am laughing to myself because it's like clearly, you know,"
7305.9,7308.9," like this is the scene where the healer rolls of, you know, whatever."
7308.9,7313.9," I mean, you could kind of feel those moments, but did that add to the excitement for you?"
7313.9,7314.9," Oh, totally."
7314.9,7315.9, Someone told me that.
7315.9,7316.9, They're happening my campaign.
7316.9,7318.9, So I can't retin this.
7318.9,7319.9, I'm wrong.
7319.9,7323.9," Yeah, so, but he's a really good writer and he's created this pretty amazing role."
7323.9,7326.9," I mean, among fantasy fans, this is a pretty highly regarded series."
7326.9,7329.9," If you're not a fantasy fan, this is probably not going to change your mind."
7329.9,7333.9," And certainly over the past few weeks, as I've read the first book, I thought,"
7333.9,7338.9," I could just bring this down to random ratings and you'll, I knew Sean would just laugh if I'm not laughing."
7338.9,7339.9, I'm not laughing.
7339.9,7340.9, Ryan's looking at you all the time.
7340.9,7344.9," I'm laughing at, I'm laughing because Ryan's basically laughing like, what a fucking door."
7344.9,7345.9, It was all right.
