120.0,121.0, Is there any more?
121.0,122.0, I started playing a little bit.
122.0,125.0, I haven't had much of a chance because this weekend as we get closer to my wedding.
125.0,127.0, I'm getting pulled into like wedding type stuff every weekend.
127.0,128.0, And you got to.

141.0,142.0, That's.
142.0,144.0, V.A.H.M.E.T.
144.0,145.0, Is it a mandatory?
145.0,146.0, You have to have a douche name.
146.0,147.0, Yeah.
147.0,150.0," Well, that was kind of intentional for it."
150.0,151.0, It's for a guild of nubes.
151.0,152.0," Oh, yeah."
152.0,153.0, Yeah.
153.0,155.0, You'll just be rejected if you create one.
155.0,156.0, And it's not douchees.
156.0,158.0," Well, it'll just say not douchees."
158.0,159.0, It was not.
159.0,160.0, Yeah.
160.0,164.0, Skip was talking about that guild on the other podcast.
164.0,167.0, The only requirement is he can't have a level 60 character.
167.0,169.0, Because it's supposed to be for casual players only.
169.0,172.0," So if you have a level 60 character on some other server,"
172.0,173.0, Skip doesn't want you.
173.0,174.0, Yeah.
174.0,175.0, You're in this guild.
175.0,176.0, Yeah.
176.0,177.0, But I just turned 60.
177.0,178.0, Oh.
178.0,179.0, So I got a pass.
179.0,181.0, So we have 50 nine characters.
181.0,182.0, You can get in.
182.0,183.0, You can get in.
183.0,184.0, Luke can't get in.
184.0,185.0, But wait.
185.0,186.0," If you have a level 60 character, doesn't matter."
186.0,188.0, Because that's not the max level anymore.
188.0,190.0, The rule is essentially no poop sockers.
190.0,191.0, Right.
191.0,192.0, That's pretty much the rule.
192.0,193.0, Yeah.
193.0,195.0, We have to explain what poop sockers know.
195.0,196.0," No, no."
196.0,197.0, We go ahead.
197.0,198.0, Some people will.
198.0,199.0, Because we've got this one.
199.0,201.0, Okay.
201.0,204.0, That's actually going to be the hook to get people to listen to the whole podcast.
204.0,205.0, Okay.
205.0,206.0, If you need another.
206.0,208.0, If you want another definition of poop sock.
208.0,209.0, Who's soccer here?
209.0,212.0, You got to know if I can wait the entire podcast to talk about this.
212.0,213.0, Awesome.
213.0,214.0, Awesome.
214.0,218.0," And if my mom's listening this week, just log off before we get to the end."
218.0,220.0," People are like, if you can do this drinking game,"
220.0,222.0, they're already don't raise your glass yet.
222.0,225.0," If the rules are like, if they talk about scatter,"
225.0,227.0, they're farce then you have to drink.
227.0,228.0, We haven't gotten there yet.
228.0,230.0, Poof sock is not what you think it is.
230.0,231.0," Oh, that's not what it is."
231.0,232.0, No.
232.0,233.0," Boy, you just threw me off."
233.0,234.0, I thought I thought I had it.
234.0,236.0," No, I need to stay to the end too."
236.0,238.0, I'm just a good liar.
238.0,240.0, And such a tease.
240.0,243.0," So actually, so I did actually play all weekend."
243.0,244.0, Play burning because I don't wake in.
244.0,246.0, And I think it's an awesome expansion.
246.0,247.0, Yeah.
247.0,249.0," On the way to lunch, we're telling you, you're schedule for Saturday."
249.0,250.0, What was it like?
250.0,252.0, It was pathetic.
252.0,255.0, I actually got up at like six in the morning.
255.0,257.0, One of it to play.
257.0,260.0," And partially because it's so crowded in some of the zones right now,"
260.0,263.0," because everybody wants to play at night that there's, you know,"
263.0,266.0, it's got a little bit of a Disneyland weight line to kill this guy.
266.0,268.0, That's like how many six queues there.
268.0,269.0, What are you doing on the carpet?
269.0,272.0," Well, it's looking for the last little rock in film in the carpet."
272.0,274.0," Dude, come on man."
274.0,277.0, It's less busy at six in the morning.
277.0,278.0, What the hell man?
278.0,279.0," Oh, what was funny?"
279.0,280.0, It's mass greatness work.
280.0,282.0," I wouldn't have, who's in that excuse hold up to you aside from there."
282.0,283.0," And he was just like, yeah."
283.0,284.0, Yeah.
284.0,285.0, I know.
285.0,286.0, I was like in a ham.
286.0,287.0, Yeah.
287.0,288.0, He was got in nodding.
288.0,291.0, But I could see what was funny though is when I was playing at that time a day.
291.0,294.0," There were people in the general chat who were like talking and like,"
294.0,297.0," you know, some guys were saying like, you guys are like fucking geeks or people."
297.0,300.0," I'm like, man, if you're anyone who's on right now is a geek, like,"
300.0,301.0, does get over it.
301.0,302.0, If you're up playing now.
302.0,303.0, What's the deal though?
303.0,307.0," Do you, I mean, are you trying to explain away your guilt or did you feel guilt at all?"
307.0,311.0," No, I didn't feel guilt because today when you came in the office, you said, you know,"
311.0,315.0," you're like, I mean, you didn't look back on your weekend as, yeah, time will spend."
315.0,316.0," It seemed like, right."
316.0,320.0," We're looking at yourself and like, and I just imagined you basically poop sock in the"
320.0,321.0, game.
321.0,324.0," I was a little disgusting with myself, but I was letting myself go."
324.0,328.0, I knew I need to spend another week and kind of quiet and at home because I'm getting
328.0,329.0, over the pneumonia.
329.0,334.0, It was a beautiful weekend in California and had I been 100% better and had done the weekend.
334.0,335.0, I had this weekend.
335.0,336.0, I would have felt really bad about myself.
336.0,340.0," Yeah, because I should have been outside, but in general, I don't know."
340.0,342.0, I didn't feel guilty about it.
342.0,343.0, I didn't.
343.0,345.0, Did you activate the special pet that came with your collector's edition?
345.0,346.0, I did.
346.0,347.0, The net.
347.0,348.0, The net.
348.0,349.0, That's all.
349.0,350.0, You asked me to touch your phone.
350.0,351.0," It's sending way, man."
351.0,357.0," I mean, anything other than throw away the collector's cards that came in the collector's edition."
357.0,358.0, I didn't throw them out.
358.0,359.0, They're still in the box.
359.0,360.0, Did you do it?
360.0,362.0, I don't want to break the shrink wrap on the possible value.
362.0,363.0, Yeah.
363.0,364.0, I'm not breaking the shrink wrap.
364.0,365.0, The speculators market.
365.0,366.0, It's my first name.
366.0,371.0," Meanwhile, Sean, you were like an insect all weekend in that investigation."
371.0,372.0, I was in a team speak.
372.0,375.0," I was actually, I was, you know, King Freak of Mall."
375.0,376.0, I was in a team speak.
376.0,380.0, And we were going into play team fortress classic and a much rather random game.
380.0,383.0, It's like I've been waiting for a good new game to come out.
383.0,386.0," And in the meantime, I've been revisiting a much more old crap."
386.0,390.0," Like, you know, mouth to the nineteen forty two team fortress of Found."
390.0,393.0," Tons of hackers on their last night, which was really weird because with the fact"
393.0,397.0," that the Valve anti cheat software, it just seems like no one for one it works well."
397.0,398.0, And it's updated frequently.
398.0,401.0," The other thing is since it's on steam, like who's going to take the risk?"
401.0,406.0," Do you really want to caught cheating and team fortress and lose access to your entire,"
406.0,408.0," like, bunch of games and steam?"
408.0,409.0," You know, they would do it."
409.0,410.0," Yeah, that's crazy."
410.0,414.0," Yes, but there's, there's people with all kinds of hacks in there now."
414.0,415.0," So, was doing that."
415.0,418.0," But anyway, in the team speak channel, we just go to random ones and they're almost all,"
418.0,419.0, they're almost all German.
419.0,421.0," And the only thing we can say to each other is like,"
421.0,423.0," Shost,"
423.0,424.0," Shost,"
424.0,425.0," Ravstein,"
425.0,427.0," I said,"
427.0,429.0," Ravstein,"
429.0,430.0," Ravstein,"
430.0,433.0," There happened to be, there was a woman in there and,"
433.0,435.0," Just did, we do the slide."
435.0,437.0," Wait, you mean a woman or a woman?"
437.0,439.0," There was no, this is, it sounded like."
439.0,441.0," We need to, we need to, that needle scratching,"
441.0,443.0, the record sounded like stop.
443.0,444.0, It's not here.
444.0,445.0, It's all not.
445.0,446.0," Oh, no."
446.0,448.0," We're in like,"
448.0,449.0, so we're there.
449.0,455.0," And we do this thing, maybe my friend Rory, where we just pretend we're kids playing from some school."
455.0,459.0, We just elude to either our grandmother or the school that we're at.
459.0,462.0," And it might be like, it's, you know, whatever, 10 pm on the weekend."
462.0,466.0," So, you got to come here and ask us about the variety of school it is,"
466.0,468.0," you know, where you live there and they let us play games."
468.0,470.0," And so I started asking her, you know,"
470.0,473.0, in the voice that I do on here all the time.
473.0,477.0," Like, no, are you playing team foraches when you like to play some video games?"
477.0,481.0, Are you a real lady or the only sound like a woman?
481.0,485.0," So, she's like, no, you know, she tells me she's playing the world of work,"
485.0,488.0," craft burning crusade and then like, Rory and Rory will chime in like,"
488.0,490.0," what, where am I?"
490.0,492.0, Jay is like this random stuff.
492.0,494.0," It's, it's usually totally buying it."
494.0,499.0," And she, she's asking us, you know, why don't you guys play burning crusade?"
499.0,502.0," And I told her, you know, because it's got, you know, devils in it."
502.0,503.0, And all the sudden things.
503.0,505.0, And then we'll turn her back.
506.0,508.0," I'm trying to, this is like going, this is spinning wrong."
508.0,510.0," All of a sudden, there was like a punch line to the story."
510.0,512.0, And I'm trying to find my way back to it.
512.0,513.0, I'm going to get back then.
513.0,516.0," But basically, I don't load it."
516.0,519.0," It came, oh, yeah, the monthly fees, you know, so I was like,"
519.0,521.0," you know, don't you have to pay a lot of money on me,"
521.0,523.0, month and play that game.
523.0,525.0," She's like, well, consider you know, all the enjoyment you get,"
525.0,527.0," not really, you don't have to."
527.0,531.0," And I was like, well, I could spend that same amount of money on McDonald's."
531.0,534.0," And then she said, well, McDonald says,"
534.0,538.0," well, there's game, well, there's game, when you mean every time I get a"
538.0,540.0," laugh, there's games right on the box."
540.0,541.0, Happy mail.
541.0,545.0, And cut out the little picture and sometimes you've got your own
545.0,546.0, dice.
546.0,548.0," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
548.0,550.0," But anyway, she was cool."
550.0,552.0," She didn't run away and she was just alone in that room with,"
552.0,553.0, when she thought we're two.
553.0,555.0," I just want to point, I just want to point, I just want to point."
555.0,557.0, She sounds kind of scary now.
557.0,559.0, She hung around there with you.
559.0,562.0, Probably it's just sitting there poop sock and it couldn't afford to all
562.0,563.0, the kids.
563.0,564.0, I'm going to throw those teams speak.
564.0,566.0, I was looking for young boys.
566.0,567.0, I can't even go with her.
567.0,570.0, I'm just going to come to Mama.
570.0,573.0," Grandma, what's in sleep and I'm going to yell at you so loud."
573.0,574.0, The clue.
574.0,576.0, Remember breastfeeding.
576.0,577.0, Sorry.
577.0,579.0, I don't think that's the point.
579.0,583.0, That only bring it back with some more burning crusade stuff.
583.0,586.0, We may be you might have killed the burning crusade.
586.0,587.0," Yeah, that kind of."
587.0,589.0," Well, I just wanted to actually, that's what I wanted."
589.0,591.0," I was nodding a little bit before when you're saying,"
591.0,593.0," I'm kind of crazy schedule, but I think it's every MMOM."
593.0,594.0, I start like that.
594.0,600.0," I'll be full, you know, great guns, until like, level 20 and then I hit this wall."
600.0,604.0," You know, we talked about that on the other podcasts too that it's a very common phenomenon"
604.0,606.0," that, like, kidding that wall."
606.0,609.0," Because, I mean, at the level 20 crisis."
609.0,610.0, It's everyone in the family.
610.0,611.0, It's a middle-aged.
611.0,612.0, It's a middle-aged crisis.
612.0,614.0," Yeah, that's something to the other."
614.0,615.0, Yeah.
615.0,617.0," At one point, it's like, you're like, you haven't fallen with it."
617.0,619.0," And then you realize, okay, what is, what is once fun?"
619.0,620.44," It's not just like, okay now I realize how much you're"
620.44,621.5600000000001, which are freaking like treadmill.
621.5600000000001,623.44," It starts with coming work rather than,"
623.44,625.9200000000001," because once you 20 is like a casual thing,"
625.9200000000001,627.7600000000001, you just level whatever that sense is
627.7600000000001,629.6, that's kicking in at level 20 is the one thing
629.6,631.44, that's that what it's humans for mile lemmings.
631.44,634.5600000000001, You are such a hate or man.
634.5600000000001,635.84," Oh, if it's a game's you like."
635.84,638.36," I was just gonna say, man, come on."
638.36,640.0, Come on from the guy who spends 500 plus hours
640.0,641.32, and you gotta go to your factory.
641.32,642.48, You're not a geek.
642.48,647.32," You fuck you, I'm level 60 and I'm proud, man."
647.32,648.6400000000001," No shame, man."
648.64,651.0, I got the poop soccer's badge and battlefield.
651.0,652.16, That's why you're gonna prove it.
652.16,654.56," Actually, I did feel that there was some like ironic,"
654.56,658.48, I got damn it that I finally hit level 60 after two years.
658.48,660.84, Two days after they raised the limit of 70.
660.84,663.1999999999999," It is like, I'm proud of what you point out"
663.1999999999999,666.08," that you guys are like, I'm the drunk, I'm the alcoholic,"
666.08,667.48, but I drink beer.
667.48,668.3199999999999, Right.
668.3199999999999,669.4," And you guys are like the alcoholic,"
669.4,670.4399999999999, so I'm like nit train.
670.4399999999999,671.6," Oh, whoa, whoa."
671.6,672.4399999999999, Watch that.
672.4399999999999,673.6, Ha ha ha.
673.6,674.4399999999999, Baco.
674.4399999999999,675.28, Baco.
675.28,678.16, And we sit here and we take a cheese ride where geeks.
678.16,679.52," I'm telling you, no more."
679.52,680.7199999999999, Ha ha ha.
680.7199999999999,681.64," No, actually, yeah."
681.64,683.36," So I got that all right, you're not on nit train."
683.36,684.1999999999999, That's hardcore.
684.1999999999999,686.76, You guys are on like the barbells and James cool.
686.76,689.4," Fuzzy neighborhood, whatever."
689.4,692.28," So yeah, you're drunk and you're drinking Zima then."
692.28,694.0," No, that's what you're drinking, dude."
694.0,695.4, Mike's hard lemonade.
695.4,696.56, We're all geeks.
696.56,701.12," All right, that's just very, you know, variations on a theme."
701.12,704.68," So let's talk about, before we break off another thing,"
704.76,709.3199999999999, that was we got the list of the top 10 PC games of 2006.
709.3199999999999,709.8199999999999, Okay.
709.8199999999999,711.68, This will be John Raphree.
711.68,713.0799999999999, This is our North American number.
713.0799999999999,716.68, North American sales best selling PC games of 2006.
716.68,718.52," All right, let's hear him."
718.52,720.76," Number one, World of Warcraft."
720.76,721.76, Super great.
721.76,722.76, Surprise.
722.76,723.52, Made money and people can't be wrong Sean.
723.52,724.3599999999999," Yeah, they can't."
724.3599999999999,725.3599999999999, Can they come on.
725.3599999999999,726.3599999999999, Yeah.
726.3599999999999,727.3599999999999, How many of you show up there?
727.3599999999999,729.4799999999999," They're totally, after I told you to turn your Britney Spears"
729.4799999999999,733.8, out and tell you the same thing after after I asked you.
733.8,735.3599999999999, Why do you record in Dr. Phil?
735.3599999999999,736.92, You told me the same thing.
736.92,740.24," That's right, and all those people are great."
740.24,740.9599999999999, I like to play.
740.9599999999999,743.24," Wow, with Dr. Phil and Brittany."
743.24,745.5999999999999, And we all say fuck you all three.
745.5999999999999,746.56, Phil Brittany and me.
746.56,748.8, We've got three birds for you.
748.8,750.64, We've got three.
750.64,753.7199999999999," Then, number two is Sims 2."
753.7199999999999,756.56," In fact, let's just let me go ahead and skip around here."
756.56,763.0799999999999," Number two, three, five, eight and 10 are all Sims 2 related."
763.1600000000001,765.6800000000001," Two, three, five, eight and 10 have to list."
765.6800000000001,766.6800000000001, Not one first person shooter.
766.6800000000001,767.88, That Sims 2.
767.88,770.0400000000001, Sims 2 open for a business expansion pack.
770.0400000000001,771.64," Sims 2, pet six, mansion pack."
771.64,774.48," Sims 2, family fun, stuff expansion pack."
774.48,776.32," And Sims 2, nightlife expansion pack."
776.32,778.5200000000001, That's five of the top 10.
778.5200000000001,781.0," Wow, what do we think about that?"
781.0,783.24," Well, doesn't make us cry?"
783.24,785.84," He's the gamers here, a bunch of girls."
785.84,786.88, Apparently they're listening to me.
786.88,787.72, Maybe he's listening to me.
787.72,789.32," He's in Dr. Phil, I don't know."
789.32,790.32, It's a very odd thing.
790.32,792.0400000000001," No, bad, I mean, that's very true."
792.12,793.28," I mean, you said, right?"
793.28,795.52," In North America, PC game."
795.52,799.0, What's interesting is that all the people that bought those games
799.0,802.0, are not really readers of our magazine.
802.0,802.8399999999999, Right.
802.8399999999999,806.8, So five of the top 10 are really going to our big bot
806.8,811.16, by gamers who probably don't consider themselves hardcore gamers.
811.16,812.04," You know, it's actually kind of flinted."
812.04,813.56, It dedicated to one franchise.
813.56,814.8399999999999, I was actually kind of reminds me.
814.8399999999999,817.48," I was in, I was a, I ran up in a bar this weekend, big surprise."
817.48,820.8," And there's some, there's some girl over here's game conversation."
820.8,822.9599999999999," I was talking, I was hanging out with Fabler in a bar,"
822.9599999999999,823.76, friend of mine.
823.76,826.76," Anyway, so girl comes up, ask you why you drink it's you, my."
826.76,827.76, Exactly.
827.76,829.88," She goes, you are the coolest guy here."
829.88,830.88, Do you play?
830.88,832.1999999999999, Wow.
832.1999999999999,833.4," Yeah, I'm pretty."
833.4,837.4399999999999, So I'm drinking my Jack straight.
837.4399999999999,839.0, Thank you.
839.0,840.8399999999999, She overhears our conversation about gaming stuff.
840.8399999999999,842.0," And she says, I'm not like, you know,"
842.0,843.92," she says, I would still not let my boyfriend play games."
843.92,845.52, And she goes off on all this stuff.
845.52,848.28," And then she goes, well, I do play some stuff like this Sims."
848.28,849.68, And it's kind of funny.
849.68,850.52, There's a huge disconnect.
850.52,852.28, She doesn't see herself as a gamer at all.
852.28,853.28, Mm-hmm.
853.28,856.12," This is some total random, you know, sampling out there in the world."
856.12,858.12," But it's odd, too, that the Sims, you know,"
858.12,860.92, began life as pretty hard core game.
860.92,862.84, But it's morphed into something totally different.
862.84,864.4399999999999, Virtual paper dolls.
864.4399999999999,865.16, Yeah.
865.16,868.12," But five of the top 10 to round out that top 10, then,"
868.12,872.04," wrong with, wow, and the five Sims two entries are Star Wars and"
872.04,875.88," Power at War at number four, which was a good RTS."
875.88,877.48, Yeah.
877.64,880.84, Elder's holds four oblivion was number six.
880.84,884.12," And, uh, it's the eight vampires three with seven."
884.12,886.84," And, Civ four was number nine."
886.84,890.2, So what's interesting there is a lot of strategy games.
890.2,891.16," Right, at the top 10."
891.16,892.2, Definitely.
892.2,894.6," Surprise, that Star Wars game was on there."
894.6,895.88, Star Wars game was right after me.
895.88,897.08, Tired and Civ.
897.08,898.84," It did, Civ was number nine."
898.84,900.28, Yeah.
900.28,902.52," Well, Civ had come out in 2005 though."
902.52,903.24, It wasn't.
903.24,904.52," Yeah, that's true, actually."
904.52,905.96, So that's actually sort of impressive.
905.96,908.2800000000001, It's done the list a year later.
908.2800000000001,912.9200000000001," Um, if we had actually prepared for this podcast, we could actually go through all the"
912.9200000000001,916.2," great 2006 games who didn't, that did not make this list."
917.0,918.9200000000001," Well, if we actually went and grabbed our,"
918.9200000000001,920.52," or we could, or you issue, or you,"
920.52,922.76," do we, we did kind of just talk about all this recently as we're doing."
922.76,925.1600000000001," Or, you mean the company here is on there is frightening."
925.1600000000001,926.2800000000001," Yeah, Olivia is not on there."
926.2800000000001,926.9200000000001, No oblivion is.
926.9200000000001,928.36," Well, Olivia is like, it's number six."
928.36,930.6," It's a lot lower than, but it's number six."
930.6,934.6," Yeah, oblivion is below three of these Sims two entries."
934.9200000000001,936.36," So yeah, I mean, like, let me just like,"
936.36,938.12," I'm not a ferrous like you said, not on there."
938.12,940.6," But I mean, in general, just like all, not just strategy games, but all the"
940.6,944.2," good games, it came out this year that like, right, you know, fell off this list all together."
944.2,945.0, Mm-hmm.
945.0,946.6," I mean, um,"
946.6,948.6," okay, company here is obviously, I mean,"
948.6,950.6, company here is coming a lot later in the year though too.
950.6,953.0," Also, what I'd like to know is what is the difference in numbers?"
953.0,954.76, Because we don't have the actual numbers here.
954.76,956.36," Between number one and number two,"
956.36,958.2, one being wow and two being Sims.
958.2,959.96," Did there, there are a lot of, if like that's here."
959.96,961.8000000000001, It was also a winter like worldwide.
961.8,966.68," Sales would really skew it, not the usual like work off stuff with like the"
966.68,969.4," Asian market, but just like, yeah, once you get the Germans and then you"
969.4,972.04," get, you know, all the weird strategy games in the right."
972.04,974.8399999999999, And I'm sure this was something all along.
974.8399999999999,979.0," I'm sure that like, uh, Titan questions upon that list."
979.0,979.4, Right.
979.4,981.7199999999999, Company heroes and right number of other games.
981.7199999999999,985.7199999999999," Well, perhaps a professional at BC gaming podcast would have that information."
985.7199999999999,986.1999999999999, Yeah.
986.1999999999999,986.5999999999999, Let's go.
986.5999999999999,987.4, We're not going.
987.4,987.8, Let's go.
987.8,988.92, So I'm on Google.
988.92,989.64, Hey.
990.6,992.76, Maybe we'll try to remember that for next week.
992.76,994.28, Let's try to get some worldwide numbers.
994.28,996.12, See how they see how they vary.
996.12,1000.04," Well, I think the wow numbers, if I'm not mistaken, I think it was like 979,000"
1000.04,1000.92, sales.
1000.92,1002.92, It allows you to end up being number one no matter what.
1004.92,1006.36," Because it's the best, sure."
1006.36,1008.04, But after that it could be anything.
1008.04,1008.84, Not the best as Emma.
1010.84,1014.04, So is that all we have to say about that topic about the sales?
1014.04,1014.68, I guess so.
1014.68,1015.4, Yeah.
1015.4,1016.84, It's not some controversial.
1016.84,1018.4399999999999," That's what we've been, we were used to this."
1019.4000000000001,1019.5600000000001, Yeah.
1019.5600000000001,1020.2, I think shocking.
1020.2,1020.5200000000001, Yeah.
1020.5200000000001,1024.76," If all of a sudden, if it had been, you know, shooters that had been"
1024.76,1028.3600000000001, don't don't aim that list for the past years or something.
1028.3600000000001,1029.48, Interesting not one or two.
1029.48,1029.88, Shooters.
1029.88,1030.3600000000001, Not one.
1030.3600000000001,1031.0800000000002, Don't go on that list.
1031.0800000000002,1031.48," Oh, also."
1031.48,1033.88," And there weren't that many, like, how"
1033.88,1035.56, with what were the good shooters of this year?
1035.56,1036.04, Pray.
1036.04,1036.8400000000001," Well, this was another."
1036.8400000000001,1037.0800000000002, Yeah.
1037.0800000000002,1038.04, There was pray.
1038.04,1039.8," There was 21, I mean, just in general,"
1039.8,1041.0800000000002," pray 21, 42."
1041.0800000000002,1041.8, Go straight.
1041.8,1042.3600000000001, Go straight.
1042.3600000000001,1042.44, Go straight.
1042.44,1042.8400000000001, Go straight.
1042.8400000000001,1043.0, Go straight.
1043.0,1043.48, Go straight.
1043.48,1044.04, Right.
1044.04,1044.2, Right.
1044.2,1044.76, Right.
1044.76,1045.16, Right.
1045.16,1046.44," I mean, what, I mean, I'm just going to"
1046.76,1049.72," what, okay, episode one, but all those sales,"
1049.72,1051.56, but most of those sales are going to be oversteam.
1051.56,1055.16," Well, a year from now would be interesting to come back here and see if we're going to see things like"
1055.16,1058.8400000000001, Quake Wars and that's another thing for those numbers.
1058.8400000000001,1059.88, It's not taking into account.
1059.88,1062.3600000000001," We always say it, but it's not taking into account, you know,"
1062.3600000000001,1063.56, steaming on these stores.
1063.56,1064.28," Well, true."
1064.28,1064.52, Yeah.
1064.52,1067.72," And then, if you're totally floating that respect, then we're taking into account that at all just store sell."
1067.72,1071.3200000000002," Actually, that's a huge top cap even, you know, right, sales on the thing."
1071.3200000000002,1076.2," I mean, you think that like every year, I'm sure, like, the jude to still"
1076.2,1079.32," sells, you know, enough to get it on this."
1079.32,1082.1200000000001, I got a phone call this morning from ABC.
1082.1200000000001,1089.16," They asked me because with these numbers, also came up the random fact that PC game sales went up by 1%"
1089.96,1091.4, over the year before.
1091.4,1093.4," So he called me about the, quote, research."
1093.4,1094.76, It's a close market.
1094.76,1095.4, Exactly.
1095.4,1095.8, It's loading.
1095.8,1096.2, Exactly.
1096.2,1098.44," And it's like, I don't know, I don't know what to say to that."
1098.44,1099.48," I mean, is there?"
1099.48,1100.44, I don't know.
1100.44,1104.28," I mean, yeah, because what, and what, I don't even really know what to say when people say"
1104.36,1105.56, it arrives in PC gaming or not.
1105.56,1110.04," Because as you said, all those people playing pop cap games, I mean, do count that shit."
1110.04,1112.2," Do you count the like millions of people playing Yahoo,"
1112.2,1113.24, cribbit every day?
1113.24,1117.56," And, you know, I mean, if so, then then PC gaming is humongous."
1117.56,1122.84," But if we're only counting the, uh, these retail games, these high profile retail games, I don't know."
1122.84,1123.08, Yeah.
1123.08,1124.76, I don't want to answer questions like that anymore.
1125.32,1126.2, Don't call me.
1126.2,1127.16, Call someone else.
1127.16,1128.2, Call someone else.

1137.5600000000002,1138.2800000000002, With disagreeing.
1138.2800000000002,1138.76, Okay.

1151.4,1152.92," I mean, yeah."
1152.92,1154.6000000000001, And that was pretty much it.
1154.6000000000001,1154.92, Right.
1154.92,1158.3600000000001," How about, I mean, not that we actually do our homework, but they tell me he's"
1158.3600000000001,1159.72, sales that they're making his first week.
1159.72,1161.72," Well, I believe it was over a million."
1161.72,1163.16, A million in one week.
1163.16,1164.1200000000001, In front of the guys.
1164.1200000000001,1166.76, What didn't they release that number after like four days or something?
1166.76,1167.4, Yeah.
1167.4,1168.1200000000001, Yeah.
1168.1200000000001,1170.52," Years of work, trumpeting three million after how many months?"
1170.52,1172.1200000000001, A lot of people bought this is a week.
1172.1200000000001,1173.24, Burning crusade.
1173.24,1179.88," And yet people still were complaining in the, uh, in the general chat on what the hell was that noise?"
1179.88,1182.1200000000001, That was my my my my got caught on my sweater.
1182.1200000000001,1182.68, Sorry.
1182.68,1183.16, Okay.

1183.3200000000002,1184.1200000000001, Yeah.
1184.1200000000001,1184.28, Yeah.
1184.28,1184.92, Way to go.
1184.92,1185.24, Dan.
1185.24,1185.4, Yeah.
1185.4,1186.1200000000001, Nice talk.
1186.1200000000001,1186.28, Yeah.
1186.28,1186.76, That's for you.
1186.76,1186.92, Yeah.
1186.92,1187.88, We got us going to say.
1187.88,1188.6000000000001, Never mind.
1188.6000000000001,1189.72, So you're talking about the fools.
1189.72,1190.52," Oh, they didn't jump off."
1191.48,1197.08," Well, it's on day one day one of the launch is this this expansion spin into space for over a year."
1197.08,1199.48, I'm on a server that's already overcrowded.
1199.48,1202.84," I mean, they've been warning people for months that they're going to put the server because it's full."
1202.84,1205.6399999999999, There's been a queue every night even before the expansion.
1205.6399999999999,1207.08, So it's a crowded server.
1207.08,1209.16, It's night one of the launch.
1210.12,1213.8, And everybody's in the first zone because it's the only zone you can be in and guess what?
1213.8,1215.32, There's lag big surprise.
1215.32,1217.16, And there's guys in there complaining about it.
1217.72,1219.96," To me, it was like, what do you expect?"
1220.04,1221.96," I mean, how could they're not be lag here?"
1221.96,1223.96," You know, and that Blizzard fucked up the launch."
1224.52,1225.96," Like, no, they didn't."
1225.96,1227.4," It's day one, dude."
1227.4,1228.44, Way to tomorrow.
1228.44,1229.4, It'll be fine.
1229.4,1232.28," So it's just a bunch of you sitting in the same area, right?"
1232.28,1235.0," So there's a bunch of like, cloud looking."
1235.0,1236.04," Very, very good."
1236.04,1237.16, Reducing again.
1237.16,1237.56, Yes.
1237.56,1238.3600000000001, So how many gradients?
1238.3600000000001,1239.48, Because I guess true.
1239.48,1242.04, I've never had despite working with people who could
1242.04,1245.16, you explain how games work and critique them for a movie.
1245.16,1249.88, I've never had anyone present to me a strong case to why I should buy the game.
1249.88,1252.44," Or said anything about the game or I'm like, you know what?"
1253.24,1254.2800000000002, I've been a damn idiot.
1254.2800000000002,1255.24, I need to get this game.
1255.24,1257.24," But so I'm, how many matches in this game?"
1257.24,1260.68," So you got a bunch of dudes standing around, right?"
1260.68,1262.68, I can't stand around.
1262.68,1264.5200000000002, They're rubber banding around and stuff.
1264.5200000000002,1266.5200000000002, We're doing the dance animation.
1266.5200000000002,1269.16, So we're not just standing.
1269.16,1272.3600000000001," So some of you, some of them type like, shout all like,"
1273.3200000000002,1275.5600000000002," Hey, my friend is gaming."
1275.5600000000002,1276.6000000000001, It's lagging in the game.
1276.6000000000001,1277.24, Come on there.
1277.24,1278.8400000000001," Dude, it's all good."
1278.84,1279.8, It just chilled.
1279.8,1280.6, Right.
1280.6,1283.3999999999999, This is how we roll in whatever world's called Azeroth.
1283.3999999999999,1283.8799999999999, Uh-huh.
1283.8799999999999,1285.8," And then like, yeah, that's it."
1285.8,1287.24," You like, you just pan the camera."
1287.24,1289.08, You just see more and more of these fools standing.
1289.08,1289.3999999999999, Right.
1289.3999999999999,1290.76," And we're all arguing with each other,"
1290.76,1292.36," Kong, each other, losers."
1292.36,1295.48," So if you like, make a numbers appear over a monster here and there."
1295.48,1297.6399999999999, And then we all talk about how we're reporting each other.
1297.6399999999999,1298.28, Reported.
1298.28,1300.12, That's.
1300.12,1301.48, Reporting you for reporting me.
1301.48,1302.28, Yeah.
1302.28,1303.56, That's pretty much wow.
1303.56,1304.28, Yeah.
1304.28,1305.72, See what you're missing?
1306.52,1306.9199999999998, Wow.
1307.64,1310.28," So I indeed, you could save that for another."
1310.28,1311.16, And that's all about the.
1311.16,1312.28, That's all about questing.
1312.28,1313.88," It's all about losing and killing, dude."
1314.6000000000001,1316.44, But that's one of the the loot slot machines.
1316.44,1321.88," You just, you know, kill kill rat five and get the cool shoulder pads or something."
1321.88,1322.04, Okay.
1322.04,1323.0800000000002, We're changing the topic.
1323.0800000000002,1324.8400000000001, We're going to table this for another day.
1324.8400000000001,1325.8000000000002, We're going to have the epic.
1326.44,1329.48, Why you why Sean Elliott should play this game podcast.
1330.1200000000001,1332.44, And then we're going to make you play it and then report back.
1332.44,1333.8000000000002, And then I'll be back on here.
1333.8000000000002,1334.2, It's on the ground.
1334.2,1334.8400000000001, How much I love it.
1334.8400000000001,1335.24, I know.
1335.24,1335.8000000000002, You'll be.
1335.8000000000002,1336.04, You'll be.
1336.12,1336.6, Total change.
1336.6,1337.8, You'll be the next cadass.
1337.8,1339.32, I'm going to have to play some while now.
1339.32,1341.32, So I can sit with Sean against you guys.
1341.32,1343.1599999999999, But you play guild wars.
1343.1599999999999,1345.3999999999999, You don't have like a different thing that's the same thing.
1345.3999999999999,1346.2, Same general idea.
1346.76,1348.6, Or Sean would actually hate you too.
1348.6,1350.6," Actually, you were played guild wars."
1350.6,1350.76, Yeah.
1350.76,1351.8, How is that different?
1351.8,1354.36, But he stopped because it was pretty fun.
1354.36,1356.2," I mean, just like there was a pretty fun."
1357.24,1360.2," Just a wide variety of you know, spell combos and I could say."
1360.2,1361.48, You're going to say a bit about wow.
1361.48,1362.52, You've seen new areas.
1362.52,1364.68, But I wouldn't stand around in like some town.
1365.0,1369.72, There's a bunch of fools and all just like talk about like the state of the network or
1369.72,1370.2, whatever.
1370.2,1372.2," OK, why don't we just throw a glove in the middle of the street?"
1372.2,1374.76, I just made throw a golly from Potija.
1374.76,1376.8400000000001, I have to damn server with the sound lagging.
1376.8400000000001,1381.5600000000002, I put it back into my eye to box every time I attempt to put it on the auction block.
1382.68,1383.0800000000002, All right.
1383.0800000000002,1384.76, So you sound like you know a little too much.
1384.76,1385.5600000000002," Yeah, I really don't know."
1385.5600000000002,1386.04, I don't know.
1386.04,1388.04, I know enough.
1388.04,1390.3600000000001, So let's just do this now.
1390.3600000000001,1393.0, Since we're like deep in the depths of.
1393.0,1393.48, OK.
1393.48,1394.1200000000001, Have nerdville.
1394.1999999999998,1396.1999999999998," Oh yeah, okay, it's despicable."
1396.1999999999998,1397.3999999999999," I mean, OK."
1397.3999999999999,1398.84, So let's let's the podcast.
1398.84,1399.8799999999999, We have the contest.
1399.8799999999999,1400.1999999999998, Yeah.
1400.1999999999998,1405.32, And I gave away my copy of the Burning Crusade Collector's edition.
1405.32,1407.56, Big heavy box 70 VDs in it.
1407.56,1409.32," It's gotten mouse pads, maps."
1409.32,1411.08," Yeah, you were missing it earlier."
1411.08,1412.12, We remember what it is.
1412.12,1412.52, Yeah.
1412.52,1414.36," So I was like, who's calculating?"
1414.36,1415.3999999999999, It's never been a word.
1415.3999999999999,1416.36, I gave it away.
1416.36,1417.0, Yeah.
1417.0,1420.36, But the condition for the contest was that you prove.
1421.32,1425.4799999999998, You are just the biggest slime bucket and they're bag out there.
1425.4799999999998,1428.9199999999998, By showing photos of your of your gaming center and just like how
1428.9199999999998,1430.36, squall it it is.
1430.36,1431.24, It was awful.
1431.24,1434.76," So yeah, people, you know, I mean, the Ryan was upset immediately."
1434.76,1438.76, Tell me what was wrong in your mind with the principal of this contest.
1438.76,1442.76," Well, I figured that it was flawed on the basis of anybody who's going to"
1443.9599999999998,1446.12, qualified enough to enter this contest.
1446.12,1448.4399999999998, Already lined up and has a copy of this collective.
1448.4399999999998,1449.08, Yeah.
1450.04,1450.6799999999998, That's actually one good.
1450.6799999999998,1452.28, If you're living condition is that bad.
1452.28,1453.08, Right.
1453.08,1453.6399999999999, Right.
1453.6399999999999,1455.8, You've already earmarked the money to pay for it.
1455.8,1458.84, And I didn't care because I wasn't worried about getting it into the right
1458.84,1459.56, persons hands.
1459.56,1462.6799999999998, I just wanted some stuff to laugh at and I got it.
1462.6799999999998,1463.48, I just like it.
1463.48,1463.8799999999999, Space.
1463.8799999999999,1464.9199999999998, I was just on the attic.
1464.9199999999998,1465.72, Another hit.
1465.72,1469.1599999999999," I felt like I felt like I felt like I sort of like, uh, I think it was the"
1469.1599999999999,1469.96, dad and me.
1469.96,1472.6799999999998," I felt like, you know, we should have rewarded the person like with the cleanest"
1472.6799999999998,1473.0, room.
1473.0,1473.32, Right.
1473.32,1475.48," You know, when you're home and then you can have a burning crusade."
1475.48,1478.36, I wonder how many people just took a trash can just dump it over their computer.
1478.4399999999998,1480.4399999999998," We tried to, we tried to allow this, right?"
1480.4399999999998,1481.08, We did.
1481.08,1481.4799999999998, We did.
1481.4799999999998,1486.04," No, we tried to allow for people googling like filthy,"
1486.04,1486.84, fake rooms.
1487.56,1491.8799999999999," Feces plus like living space and imposing whatever,"
1491.8799999999999,1495.32, talking and fixing whatever like the hit to virus HQ.
1496.1999999999998,1498.76, So they had to have like their their screen name appear in there.
1498.76,1501.56, And some people were clever and they wrote them on tortillas like they had
1501.56,1504.12, happy and burritos with their name written on the side of them.
1504.12,1505.8799999999999, People really probably tried hard.
1505.88,1509.88," There's you know, I knew some would just like solid their space,"
1509.88,1513.0, artificially would just basically overturn trash cans on their monitor.
1513.0,1514.68, And that was fine because still it doesn't matter.
1514.68,1515.8000000000002, They got to clean it up.
1515.8000000000002,1518.8400000000001," If they want to turn it go to that late,"
1518.8400000000001,1520.6000000000001," and some, I mean, some clearly did."
1520.6000000000001,1522.1200000000001," It's like, let's, I think point out."
1522.1200000000001,1525.64, I think the best of the best of the guy who does that and he comes in second place or he just doesn't
1525.64,1525.96, look.
1525.96,1527.0, This guy's slotted.
1527.0,1529.5600000000002," We, he was going to come in second place,"
1529.5600000000002,1531.72," but I asked around the building and from, uh,"
1531.72,1533.24," I'll try to give him a monthly zone, uh,"
1533.24,1535.88," Edder and Chief then she, he volunteered to copy."
1535.88,1539.08, So I could give a second grand prize winner to Slavic.
1539.08,1539.88, To Slavic.
1539.88,1544.76," And this, this dude, he, you could tell he was a Slavic as it, you know, he was naturally a"
1544.76,1547.24," Slavic, but he was so determined to win."
1547.24,1550.44," He basically, he painted shiners on himself."
1550.44,1551.4, Taped his arm off.
1551.4,1552.28, I don't know what the hell.
1552.28,1555.72," It's like, instead of like a belt or something, he put a bunch of duct tape over his arm."
1555.72,1558.2," That's the, that's the kind of, that's the way it had one at a time."
1558.2,1559.08, He's slated back.
1559.08,1562.28," And these, these photos here, you know, pass them around in the, in the studio."
1562.36,1565.24," You can't really see anything because this is just a fraction of, you know,"
1565.24,1569.48," I went to print it only, it only, you got printed a little quarter of the image."
1569.48,1574.52," But he's, he had, you know, basically pizza mashed in between the keys of his keyboard."
1574.52,1578.6," And there was this disgusting, I mean, there was food everywhere."
1578.6,1580.36," It looked like someone, you know, like, so I'm not,"
1580.36,1581.96, he had a peg with an RPG.
1581.96,1585.3999999999999," And then just like, and there was a condom."
1585.3999999999999,1587.0," That was, that was the condom picture."
1587.0,1590.36, Condom hanging over the keyboard with the banana mashed up inside of it.
1590.36,1591.16," Oh, that's nice."
1591.64,1593.72," So this is, like, that was, that was the image I,"
1593.72,1594.52," I mean, all the time."
1594.52,1596.0400000000002," Okay, he owned the condoms."
1596.0400000000002,1598.3600000000001," So this guy, you can see all these stuff."
1598.3600000000001,1599.88," You go to our forums, you can look at these pictures."
1599.88,1603.96," But this one, there's something I want to point out, some features of it were real."
1603.96,1605.88," I mean, a lot of them, certain things would come up."
1605.88,1609.16," And you would see, you would see, like, tombs, which makes sense,"
1609.16,1612.76," because you saw, I saw the pizza in the keyboard, you know, so that you're going to need the"
1612.76,1613.4, tombs.
1613.4,1615.64," I saw for breeze, a lot makes sense."
1615.64,1616.28, It makes sense.
1616.28,1617.0800000000002, It's kind of stink.
1617.0800000000002,1620.3600000000001," But like, this food, it's got, like, you know, I see something like baby powder"
1621.32,1622.12, or something by the mom.
1622.12,1623.4799999999998," Oh, no, I'm like, oh, but change it."
1623.4799999999998,1624.28, Think about it.
1624.28,1625.4799999999998," Yeah, I think I can do anything."
1625.4799999999998,1628.04," Then yeah, if you live in these kind of conditions."
1628.04,1629.8," Okay, I can buy the baby powder."
1629.8,1631.3999999999999," Uh, but it's old bond."
1631.3999999999999,1632.9199999999998," Go, bond, go, bond, wait, man."
1632.9199999999998,1636.4399999999998," And some of these stuff, they're, I mean,"
1636.4399999999998,1638.04," that, look at that on the counter."
1638.04,1640.4399999999998, What do you see on the desktop right there?
1640.4399999999998,1643.3999999999999," Is that, is that, is that a jar of Vaseline right there?"
1643.3999999999999,1645.8," Yeah, so you get the Vaseline effect and a box of things."
1645.8,1647.1599999999999, And that can be for anything.
1647.1599999999999,1649.08," All right, right next to the notebook about this."
1649.08,1652.28," One dude, he's got a bucket of Mountain Dew."
1652.28,1655.96," Now when I say a bucket, I mean, this shit has got to handle on it."
1655.96,1658.04," Like, okay, who drinks out of a bucket?"
1658.04,1658.6799999999998, What do you mean?
1658.6799999999998,1660.36," Like, cans in a bucket or like a bucket?"
1660.36,1661.0, A bucket full of.
1661.0,1662.52, It's like 144 ounces.
1662.52,1663.56," No, no, no, no, no, no."
1663.56,1665.56," How do you know, it's actually a soda bucket?"
1665.56,1666.52," It's a bucket, it's a bucket."
1666.52,1667.72," Wait, you have a picture of that."
1667.72,1668.52," No, it's not a bucket."
1668.52,1669.24," It's a cropped out, but we got it."
1669.24,1669.96, It's show you later.
1669.96,1671.32, Is it like a giant straw?
1671.32,1671.8, It's a straw.
1671.8,1672.76," A lot of it, we're looking at it."
1672.76,1674.76," No, this was the other guy that, that one."
1674.76,1676.12, And he's just mountain Dew.
1676.12,1678.2," This says Mountain Dew on the side of the bucket, dude."
1678.2,1678.68, Wow.
1678.68,1679.32, It's a bucket.
1679.32,1681.56, This guy drinks out of a bucket.
1683.56,1685.4," He's like, you know, he's surfacing."
1685.4,1686.6, He should have been in the picture.
1686.6,1688.2, I'm a lot in a vat of air.
1688.2,1690.44," You know, I mean, he's like, comes up in that thing."
1690.44,1691.16, What?
1691.16,1693.0," I got, well, I got to say to these guys."
1693.0,1694.6," I'm not sure the guy is like, it's like,"
1694.6,1695.56, let me say this though.
1695.56,1697.8799999999999," The main thing, when I looked at these, I remember like,"
1697.8799999999999,1701.8799999999999," there's that kid, you know, when you're younger and his mom or his dad"
1701.8799999999999,1702.52, has the money.
1702.52,1704.12, And so they buy in the video game systems.
1704.12,1706.28," And you know, I really like this dude, but you can write his house."
1706.28,1708.36, Cause I want to play some fantasy star.
1708.36,1710.28, I just want to see what the Genesis looks like.
1710.28,1713.08," You know, but this dude, if this was that dude,"
1713.08,1714.36," oh, and even go."
1714.36,1716.4399999999998," I don't even, I don't even, I don't even,"
1716.4399999999998,1719.0," but it's not even, it's the same 20 years later."
1719.0,1719.9599999999998, He's your friend.
1719.9599999999998,1721.56," You know, I actually got into that place."
1721.56,1722.52, I knew a kid growing up.
1722.52,1724.6799999999998," He had like a huge, huge room."
1724.6799999999998,1727.2399999999998," And like, you know, parents would look up"
1727.2399999999998,1729.08," up at everything computers, games, whatever."
1729.08,1732.36," He would have comics, novels, books."
1732.36,1734.9199999999998, Like basically he had like stuff like string all over the floor.
1734.9199999999998,1736.4399999999998," You could see the floor without a step,"
1736.4399999999998,1737.9599999999998," but you know, you're going to be stepping on something."
1737.9599999999998,1738.36, Right.
1738.36,1738.52, Yeah.
1738.52,1739.1599999999999, That's what these are.
1739.1599999999999,1741.24," And then like, you know, but like this is like,"
1741.24,1742.36, this is total chaos there.
1742.36,1744.4399999999998," It's like, you can't see, yeah, you can't see the carpet."
1744.4399999999998,1746.4399999999998, You can't see what I want to say to these guys.
1746.4399999999998,1749.8," So especially now that they've won, just clean the fucking food up."
1749.8,1751.7199999999998," You know, if I have the nails,"
1751.7199999999998,1753.9599999999998," if you got to leave the game box is lying right,"
1753.9599999999998,1756.36," I mean, pick up those plates and put them in the kitchen."
1756.36,1757.8," You know, that's that hard."
1757.8,1759.9599999999998," Yeah, not always, but once a while mom was right, you know,"
1759.96,1761.0," just, yeah, really."
1761.0,1762.1200000000001, And there's one dude.
1762.1200000000001,1763.56, I don't see his picture here.
1763.56,1766.44, There's one dude to have like a two liter soda bottle of
1766.44,1767.4, screus.
1767.4,1768.2," Like, the pants."
1768.2,1770.2," Like, with that was that was the thing."
1770.2,1774.04," After I saw that, that was clear that you had like a pjuggie."
1774.04,1774.52, He made.
1774.52,1777.72, And I was like the only way it's getting it's going to step further.
1777.72,1779.56," If there's a poop truck, there you go."
1779.56,1782.04," And that's the floor in the secret origin when you're so like, okay."
1782.04,1786.52," So so that's basically when like these guys and every and every other respect,"
1786.52,1789.72, meaning that you're living space looks like a
1789.72,1791.72," tornado, rip through a trailer park."
1791.72,1794.3600000000001, And then it zipped down past the landfill.
1794.3600000000001,1799.16, And it just like suddenly lost all power and just dropped everything and one big
1799.16,1799.56, heat.
1799.56,1801.4," And then you get out and you say, check that out."
1801.4,1805.4, You put your steak in it and you put up four plywood walls around the side.
1805.4,1808.84," And you get, you get your like corrugated sheet metal roof on top."
1808.84,1809.64, You go in there.
1809.64,1810.68, It'll be in your hook.
1810.68,1811.32, You're wow up.
1811.32,1816.44, And then you don't stop playing wow for weeks to the point that when you have to
1816.44,1819.08," evacuate, you got a sock and you do it with a sock."
1819.08,1822.52," So basically it's a gaming who reveal you're envisioning where people are just like,"
1822.52,1824.1999999999998," you know, you know, I just find it so funny."
1824.1999999999998,1825.8799999999999, So you have a bottle full of pee.
1826.6799999999998,1828.12," You know what, that takes a lot of aim."
1828.12,1831.32," A lot of like, you know, concentration."
1831.32,1835.8799999999999, You could just get out and go to the damn bathroom and that would do some things.
1836.76,1837.8799999999999, That's a good game.
1837.8799999999999,1838.1999999999998, That's a good game.
1838.1999999999998,1838.6, That's a good game.
1839.8,1842.12," Anyway, yeah, those pictures are still up on the floor."
1842.12,1843.8, I think everyone should have a look at them.
1843.8,1847.6399999999999," Just to remind yourself, like no matter how, I mean, if you think you're slightly messy or"
1847.72,1850.76," if anyone tells you you're significantly, if you know, that tells you to clean up a little bit."
1850.76,1851.5600000000002, Go on there.
1851.5600000000002,1852.76, That hook them up with these guys.
1852.76,1853.76," Yeah, you see this, honey."
1853.76,1854.76, This is a wrong dog.
1854.76,1858.3600000000001," You know what, I want our next contest to be the opposite."
1858.3600000000001,1861.16, And I want Slavic and Manjita enter that contest.
1861.16,1862.6000000000001, So lean up your rooms.
1862.6000000000001,1864.0400000000002, You could win again if you have a clean.
1864.0400000000002,1865.5600000000002, So the gaming makeover.
1865.5600000000002,1866.6000000000001, Gaming makeover.
1866.6000000000001,1869.96," And then the one only one winner though, the guy who cleans up better."
1871.0,1872.0400000000002," The like, I can't."
1872.0400000000002,1874.68," There's some nice, I've seen versions of that."
1874.68,1877.5600000000002," People who's like, then you get all the daddy warbucks showing their like quadruple"
1877.8799999999999,1880.9199999999998, and I'm not care about if it's like fancy just cleaning.
1880.9199999999998,1881.96, We got to be nice.
1881.96,1884.52," So no, you know, stains on the floor."
1884.52,1886.2," Yeah, confused you say if you want to get action."
1887.32,1888.6799999999998, This is like on that though.
1888.6799999999998,1891.0," This is like, you're on your mom won't even call you when you're."
1891.56,1892.9199999999998, Looks like this man.
1892.9199999999998,1893.8, Maybe that's why.
1893.8,1896.28," But okay, so so going on to."
1896.28,1897.48, So to our.
1897.48,1898.52," Wow, we're awesome."
1898.52,1899.32, Go top of this today.
1899.32,1903.32," We, there's a stink online about bioshock, not even multiplayer."
1903.32,1903.6399999999999, I heard.
1903.6399999999999,1907.32," Yeah, there was, I mean, there was a little not really shock yet, but there's like"
1907.3999999999999,1910.9199999999998," there was an interview I forget where it was ran, but basically we're talking about the plans to make"
1910.9199999999998,1913.0," you know, bioshock steam."
1913.6399999999999,1915.1599999999999," Oh, pardon me, simply single player."
1915.72,1915.96, Right.
1915.96,1918.52, And no demo possibly do something.
1918.52,1919.6399999999999, A focus and get me game out the door.
1920.28,1923.32," So I mean, what do you, what do you guys thought's on a single player game only?"
1924.2,1926.28," Well, they never said it was going to have multiplayer."
1926.28,1927.08, That's nothing.
1927.08,1927.6399999999999, It was it.
1927.6399999999999,1928.36," I mean, the Libyan's."
1928.36,1928.6799999999998, I agree.
1928.6799999999998,1929.24, I don't exactly.
1929.24,1930.6, Game after game is single player player.
1930.6,1930.76, Right.
1930.76,1933.08," I was going to say like, you know, the last system shot game was like,"
1933.08,1934.6799999999998, play one of my favorite single pair games.
1934.6799999999998,1935.8, I have no problem.
1935.8,1936.12, Yeah.
1936.1999999999998,1937.2399999999998, It's such a dot.
1937.2399999999998,1938.6, Like it's not a show.
1938.6,1942.52, We have games that are like explicitly multiplayer.
1943.1599999999999,1945.08, The powerful series Quake Wars.
1945.3999999999999,1951.1599999999999," I'm not going to like knock it when they do provide it because like crisis, the multiplayer looks like"
1951.1599999999999,1954.76," that for some for that looks like the game that could not only, I mean,"
1954.76,1958.6," we don't know yet, but it could very well end up being the best single player shooter you"
1958.6,1961.08, played that year in the best multiplayer you play there.
1961.08,1964.36," But I think that's a rarity and I think in most cases,"
1965.32,1968.4399999999998," if they're just going to give you, you know, hey, here's here's some of the"
1969.32,1971.24, environment that we already created for single player.
1971.24,1972.12, We're just going to rework it.
1972.12,1972.9199999999998, No map.
1972.9199999999998,1976.12, Give you some of the same guns and put you in a space with death match and team death match.
1976.12,1976.9199999999998, Yeah.
1976.9199999999998,1980.36," I mean, it's kind of cool, but it's like, I don't know if it's not there."
1980.36,1982.4399999999998," You know, I felt that way about prey."
1982.4399999999998,1984.6799999999998, I had no interest in playing a multi player.
1984.6799999999998,1985.3999999999999, I was fine.
1985.3999999999999,1986.4399999999998," I mean, I'm sure I was."
1986.4399999999998,1987.9599999999998, But I didn't even dare.
1987.9599999999998,1991.3999999999999," But yeah, you don't need like you didn't need that to get the game."
1991.3999999999999,1993.3999999999999, And when half life two ship didn't have.
1993.3999999999999,1993.7199999999998, Right.
1993.8,1994.28, Right.
1994.28,1995.8, No multiplayer.
1995.8,1999.8," And you know, the death match component came out a short while after, but it."
1999.8,2000.76, I didn't have.
2000.76,2001.08, Right.
2001.08,2004.3600000000001," I was just going to say, I think I guess my only thing about it is it."
2004.3600000000001,2007.72," It used to be a thing in the past, it used to be a big concern having multiplayer in a game."
2007.72,2010.3600000000001," And I'm glad it's at the point now where if you want to make a good single player game,"
2010.3600000000001,2011.16, just make that.
2011.16,2011.48, Right.
2011.48,2016.2," If you want to, if it has great multiplayer bonus better that than half as."
2016.2,2016.84, Exactly.
2016.84,2017.8, Don't have as it.
2017.8,2019.32, I'd rather have nothing than if you had that.
2019.32,2020.3600000000001, That's like the player.
2020.6799999999998,2024.12," And then like, you know, a Doom 3 came out like through who cared about the multiplayer."
2024.12,2027.08," Like, except for like the, you know, the pro death match."
2027.08,2031.6399999999999," Because no one that played pro death match, we wanted to play it on Doom 3 at that time because"
2031.6399999999999,2036.36," the performance was like, you know, uh, inconsistent in any other circumstance,"
2036.36,2037.8, you would just play quite three.
2037.8,2038.84," You play quite three, reenacted."
2038.84,2039.0, That's true.
2039.0,2042.9199999999998," And then real tournament or something like Counter Strike at one point six, even"
2042.9199999999998,2048.44," even that source came out, people are still, you know, resistant to, to moving up to the, to the"
2048.44,2049.72, current stuff when they're.
2049.7999999999997,2051.8799999999997, So I think we're declaring this a non issue.
2051.8799999999997,2053.0, We don't care.
2053.0,2054.7599999999998," Yeah, we definitely not getting anyone."
2054.7599999999998,2058.12, I think we're all psyched about bio shock to almost definitely.
2058.12,2060.8399999999997," But, but as a single player game can't wait for the game."
2060.8399999999997,2061.64, Yeah.
2061.64,2065.48," And I love multiplayer shooters too, but it's like, I just, I don't need it to be everything."
2066.68,2067.16, Great.
2067.16,2071.3199999999997," I, I have, I definitely have times when I, I want to play with other people, but I have"
2071.3199999999997,2076.12, times when I just want a game on my own as sort of a way to whatever chill out on my own.
2076.2,2079.64," So, I mean, single player gaming, I probably do more than multiplayer game."
2079.64,2080.64, Right.
2080.64,2082.04, It's kind of funny for a while is kind of like that for me.
2082.04,2083.56, I prefer to play a lot of game alone.
2083.56,2086.04," And then when I got to the rating level stuff and I just think I'd play once in a while,"
2086.04,2088.68," and just say, forget it, I'm done with this because people would piss me off."
2088.68,2093.48," The two, it's got to be difficult for for developers because the two types of modes are so"
2093.48,2096.44, different and the demands for more or so different.
2096.44,2099.72," That it is asking me to double the work and in some cases like, you know, with our"
2099.72,2103.08," cane and Kuju for dark and was side, they actually have different groups."
2103.24,2106.2799999999997, They have one and a whole other development team work out the multiplayer.
2106.2799999999997,2109.72," Well, a lot of times I do like like garage, another example, two different teams."
2109.72,2113.96," And actually that was when they kind of annoyed me was in garage, you can like, in single player,"
2113.96,2117.48," you can do like, you know, sliding and like crouching and all this posting stuff and you"
2117.48,2118.44, couldn't do it in multiplayer.
2118.44,2119.24, Mm-hmm.
2119.24,2122.44," And like to me, like that was the game, but like the excuse, I think they head behind"
2122.44,2127.24," up time was, oh, I said, it was intentional design from multiplayer to speed it up, and I'm like,"
2127.24,2128.2, I don't know if I buy that.
2128.2,2128.52, Yeah.
2129.16,2129.96, Mm-hmm.
2129.96,2136.6," And then we've got the big, uh, other big news story the day that we broke is the crossing we did."
2136.6,2137.64, That's all you have to try.
2137.64,2140.6, That's where the multiplayer and the single player don't really make a difference.
2140.6,2142.28," Right. That's our, that's a bit marked."
2142.28,2143.88, That was my clever segue by the mark.
2143.88,2145.32," No, that's our February camera story."
2145.32,2145.56, Yeah.
2145.56,2147.48, Bring it up again because it's on slash dot today.
2147.48,2149.48, It's one of the top stories on there.
2149.48,2152.52," Yes, slash dot credits one up, but we broke the news, baby."
2152.52,2154.2," Yeah, so, so that's there."
2154.2,2157.48," There's some funny, there's some funnier responses and there people, I mean, it's interesting"
2157.56,2159.56, to see how everyone's reacting to.
2159.56,2160.04, I think.
2160.04,2160.2, I think.
2160.2,2160.84, I think.
2160.84,2161.0, Yeah.
2161.0,2161.56, I'm slash dot.
2161.56,2165.08," So when they're comments like, um, and every bring everyone up speed,"
2165.08,2167.48, won't hash it out again because it is on the one up show.
2167.48,2168.28, I talked about it there.
2168.28,2174.52," We're issues out now and our, our issue after that shipping, um, but basically it combines"
2174.52,2178.44," they call it cross play, cross player, and it combines single player with multiplayer,"
2178.44,2179.4, and all these different ways.
2179.4,2185.08," And so some of the responses that I mean, you could tell people are just expecting the worst in this."
2185.16,2187.0," So we got one guy, anonymous coward."
2188.2799999999997,2189.96, I got Q up his voice.
2189.96,2191.96," He says, well, yeah, great."
2191.96,2195.0, I'm really looking forward to being spawn camped in a single player game.
2196.2,2201.48, Then we got a canthro says not to mention being repeatedly owned by half a dozen Korean kids.
2202.68,2203.7999999999997," Oh, and then we got."
2203.7999999999997,2207.56," I see a problem with this skill gap between people, typically play single player,"
2207.56,2209.4, FPS to enjoy storyline.
2209.4,2214.6," People that play multiplayer competitively so huge that no armor, health, boost, or anything."
2214.68,2215.64," Well, help."
2215.64,2220.8399999999997," So, uh, the guy there said, I mean, they're all with their all responding to is the whole, the whole thing"
2220.8399999999997,2223.96," is that when you go into a multiplayer game, yeah, people are good."
2223.96,2225.96," And I, yeah, I've called him some onts in the podcast."
2225.96,2226.92, I want to spread that term.
2226.92,2227.56, They're some onts.
2227.56,2231.72," So when they can kick your ass without trying, and a multiplayer FPS is a sub one."
2231.72,2233.16, And not also vansos.
2233.16,2235.72, So some of them are just people who spend three hundred times a minute.
2235.72,2236.52," My turn, man."
2236.52,2237.0, Don't challenge.
2237.0,2237.7999999999997, You take it back.
2237.7999999999997,2239.64," It's not, it's not sub-bought in the way."
2240.2,2243.4, Does it mean they can count like how many put two things fell in the floor when you
2243.4,2246.52," overturn the box, but you're assuming that if you, if you're only good,"
2246.52,2249.0," because you spent three hundred hours in it, you're not a sub-bought."
2249.0,2251.48," And army of winning, man, as we were talking about, right?"
2251.48,2254.12, And you're a loser who had nothing better than it at this time.
2254.12,2254.84, Poobsockers.
2254.84,2255.56, Yeah.
2255.56,2257.56, Why are you trying to make up new ones?
2258.76,2261.1600000000003," So, okay, so, Poobsockers and savants alike."
2261.1600000000003,2262.52," Okay, there we go."
2262.52,2267.32," And, and of course, you know, it's like, when everyone sees it, and it was, those were, you know,"
2267.32,2271.32," my concerns exactly was like, okay, well, obviously, they're going to have to stack the"
2271.4,2272.92, way that this opera is.
2272.92,2278.6000000000004," And that means that if you're playing as the single player, who is, or the narrative mode player,"
2278.6000000000004,2281.2400000000002," you're going to expect, at the end of the day, you need to win."
2281.2400000000002,2281.56, Right.
2281.56,2282.76," Be able to write, win."
2282.76,2283.4, Right.
2283.4,2288.04," And so the challenges and so much that, I mean, they should just, like these guys,"
2288.04,2292.36," our can, I mean, you know, despite reviews for, for Dr. Simon issues, these guys have made games"
2292.36,2293.0, before.
2293.0,2293.7200000000003, They know that.
2293.7200000000003,2297.88," They know that they, the person of a plane, the narrative portion of the game,"
2297.88,2299.4, is going to expect to win if so.
2299.48,2303.56," So what does that mean for the people on the, I'm sorry, I'm interrupting it, but I just,"
2303.56,2304.36, one quick question.
2304.36,2306.36," That's what, what does that mean for the people on the other side?"
2306.36,2307.56, That's exactly where I'm going.
2307.56,2308.36, That's where you go.
2308.36,2308.76, Okay.
2308.76,2311.32," And that should be, I think, where people should be concerned about."
2311.32,2311.64, Okay.
2311.64,2315.56," And that's where I'm most concerned is that, you know, not only, you know,"
2315.56,2320.12," not only is it a question of who wants to be those people, you know, and in the one of"
2320.12,2322.92," show I compared them to the dudes that come out in half life on the, on the bridge, and"
2322.92,2326.28," you're in the, you can ask, actually, you know, right, come out there so you can hit the"
2326.36,2328.6800000000003, pilings of the pier and they can fall down into the river.
2328.6800000000003,2333.32," So it's not, not only who wants to be those guys, and, you know, who's going to play him with"
2333.32,2338.28," Gusto, but like, I mean, how, you know, yeah, how much fun is that going to be and how long?"
2338.28,2339.32, How are you going to be a red charm?
2339.32,2341.7200000000003," I mean, I, I, I, I, I mean, you know, I mean, you, you know, I mean, you're so,"
2341.7200000000003,2345.0," the guys just want to be the bad guys for five seconds, and they can swap out and change"
2345.0,2348.28," sides or whatever, but, but you, I think the way that the process works,"
2348.28,2352.28," so you're not going to be able to say, hey, I'm going to be like, showed number 20."
2352.84,2356.0400000000004," So, I thought, and then all of a sudden you go back and be, when I've got to, I hope"
2356.0400000000004,2359.32," there's a role name show number six. Yeah, yeah, it's out of the in the credit."
2359.32,2362.92," You're going to be able to, you're going to be able to go between like, and we call the, the,"
2363.32,2366.6800000000003," the Kenzie quintuplets and other games, like, Son of EGM, the, uh, because, you know,"
2366.6800000000003,2369.7200000000003, the dudes come out the only thing different is the color of their Hawaiian shirt.
2369.7200000000003,2374.44," It's like, yeah, the word blue. Oh, oh, for everything else, the okay,"
2374.44,2379.48," from the same giant, like, most fertile womb in the, in the, somewhere deep in the heart of"
2379.48,2382.44," mobland, the earth, the earth, the earth, mother, birth to butter, guys."
2384.44,2388.76," So you get to be the kind of the Mackenzie's. And I mean, yeah, I'll be playing,"
2388.76,2392.92," having played Left or Dead, which is another game, don't confuse the two, but it's similar in"
2392.92,2397.72," that you get to play the bad guys in portions, right, play the different zombies. And, and similarly,"
2398.28,2402.92, that game is not meant to be a tournament game where humans play zombies and anyone can win.
2402.92,2407.16," You're still, the humans are supposed to win. So it's definitely, and I played it,"
2407.3199999999997,2410.7599999999998," and I described that game to everyone that I cocaught, I can't wait to play the zombies. And that's what I was"
2410.7599999999998,2414.6," thinking too. But the one I played it, the humans were a lot more fun because they're sturdy,"
2414.6,2419.7999999999997," or just for the fact that they don't die. So like, freaking easily. And they take less work."
2419.7999999999997,2423.3199999999997," They, the skills that you're already used to that you've already owned elsewhere, basically pointing"
2423.3199999999997,2428.3599999999997," shooting, using, uh, firewalls with Maltov cocktails and stuff, but, but, I mean, they're entirely"
2428.3599999999997,2431.96," different for, say, if you all, you can really do as Hang Someone with the Tonga and you've got to find"
2431.96,2435.8799999999997," some way to ambush them and hope that their teammate doesn't get you and you basically grow, you know,"
2435.88,2441.6400000000003," grab them around their neck that pull them up. Um, so it was fun, but then, and then when you die,"
2441.6400000000003,2445.56," you know, it takes like three hits. So when shoots you, so when shoots you, and you die,"
2445.56,2449.6400000000003," then you're going to wait like 15 seconds. And you're like, that's a long time. You know, it's like"
2449.6400000000003,2453.88," when a counter strike match moves on and then the last two dudes are playing chicken shit. And you're like,"
2453.88,2458.04," just go, dude, just try to plant freaking bomb. And everyone starts starting like boats, you know,"
2458.04,2462.6," kick this dude, or battlefield two. It's like always the last guy alive. He's always all spawn points."
2462.68,2467.24," The last guy lives a sniper sitting up where he like, meant absolutely jack shit to the whole game."
2467.24,2471.3199999999997," And I like to be that guy. And how many times have you done that with, we're already like, you're"
2471.3199999999997,2475.72," all one-sided on the other thing. Just like, no, I hate that guy. And we're just like, everyone just like,"
2475.72,2479.72," matches their keyboard, their fingers bleed about like trying to tell the other team where he's"
2479.72,2484.36," happening. Of course, the other team can't read what you're saying when you're dead. But anyway,"
2484.36,2488.8399999999997," so that's the concern, like what you pointed out Jeff, yeah, thinking that and it's going to be"
2489.48,2495.56, tough to make it fun to be those dudes. But they do solve it by like sheer numbers and then
2496.04,2500.28," being able to work together in, you know, in the segments of the game where instead of just"
2500.28,2503.88," you're playing the typical bad guys that spawn in, you're not playing the dudes that come out on"
2503.88,2508.28," the pier to take a swim, you're playing like a big battlefield style match. And then these guys"
2508.28,2511.56, come in and they're out of like the elites or something. It's like the dudes in the battle walk
2511.56,2515.48," or almost. Right. And you don't have to, you can still get points and still play and fight the"
2515.48,2520.52, guys and other team. You just don't have to like focus entirely on taking those two guys out.
2520.52,2525.32, All right. You guys are drawn pictures now. I'm listening. That's why it's commenting on your
2525.32,2530.76, pitch. Give me the pen. I'll drop the pictures. So what are we going to class all this up in? I know.
2530.76,2534.76," Yeah, you got yelled at by the teachers. Turn that computer. I don't want to see anyone playing"
2534.76,2539.64," mine sweeper. It's not fun, man. I was a teacher. I know that experience. You brought a"
2539.64,2542.92, hard to do the link back for me. I'm just doodle. These want kids. The
2542.92,2546.92," grab this. Greg Ford saying hurry it up. He's like, wrap it together with the wrap it up."
2546.92,2553.2400000000002," Siggle. Wrap that sheet up. Next topic. Oh, I have another topic, man. We don't have it."
2553.2400000000002,2557.4," Yeah, we did. We have letters. We have readers. Let's do the letters. We'll do those."
2557.4,2563.08," Ryan, we get your name. We have some good ones. We have good ones this this week. Holy crap. Yeah."
2563.64,2569.2400000000002, All right. Let's see. We'll start off with a wow one. Awesome. College boy.
2569.64,2575.16," At with the burning crusade out, I was hoping that Blizzard had opened the game to more casual"
2575.16,2580.2799999999997, players and the dungeons no longer take a day to go through. Can I now pick up the game and clear
2580.2799999999997,2584.3599999999997, through a dungeon within one to two hours and get some real nice epic loot? Or are they falling
2584.3599999999997,2590.4399999999996, into the same in game six hour Rintin repeat pitfalls? His purse have been answered aside from the
2590.4399999999996,2595.3999999999996," getting epic loot part, which would be silly after an hour. So what what the hell is he doing?"
2595.4,2599.64, It's four for his not epic loot. You got to earn it. But their options would take more than an hour.
2599.64,2603.88," Oh, hell. Oh, she's there. There are, there are don't have a day. Oh, yeah."
2603.88,2607.32," Okay, you never get me to play like that. And that's why I stopped we before."
2607.32,2613.48," No, but they did, they did, they did add new five man dungeons that instances that are about an hour."
2613.48,2617.64," They're quite fun. So that they did do that. That's good. I mean, like that can deal with."
2617.64,2622.44, It was the ones where like it's like hour four and it's a tough command. She don't get any real reward.
2622.68,2625.96," No, you get a particular part. No, you get good loot, but epic is different."
2625.96,2628.76, I think the insurgent in all I got was this shitty coin.
2629.32,2631.96," Well, you know what you're getting going in the way. You don't have to do it."
2631.96,2636.44, What tells you? Yeah. Beat on this dragon for five gold. Sure. That's what all the
2636.44,2639.4, lot of questions like that. You know what you're what you're getting going into it.
2639.4,2641.4," To get theme park. Yeah, it's like a theme park."
2643.08,2648.84," Yeah, so yet the answers. Yes. They have, they have a casual quest or casual dungeons."
2649.0,2653.7200000000003," Right, the casual ask. And there's their like right from the start with burning crusade. Yeah."
2655.1600000000003,2660.28," So yes. Good to know. Well, next, that was an easy one. That was an easy one. That's a tough one."
2660.28,2661.56, Right here. Here's a tough one.
2662.76,2670.6000000000004, Seb stick basically asks for for in and those what what to your stance on care bear.
2672.2000000000003,2676.84, PvE gameplay like very PvE focus versus PvP.
2677.1600000000003,2681.2400000000002, And you can either take it or take it. Yeah. That's like a whole podcast topic.
2681.2400000000002,2687.8," Yeah, that's all right. Well, translate a care bear is, you know, and basically it's a"
2687.8,2693.7200000000003," derogatory word for a non PvP server, non PvP environment where people are just on"
2693.7200000000003,2700.76," questing, you know, against the NPC mobs, whatever, and the player on player interaction is"
2701.6400000000003,2708.76," friendly or not hostile at least, you know, a non ganking environment versus."
2708.76,2718.1200000000003," Yeah, versus the PvP, which we all know what that is. So, you know, I don't know about that"
2718.1200000000003,2724.1200000000003," question. That's a tough question. Really, that can just take hours. Well, you play on a PvP"
2724.2,2730.68," server on Wauery, you used to, right? I used to actually had him moved. PvP, you know, having played"
2730.68,2738.12," both in Wau, I am exceiling because the PvP can get incredibly frustrating because in the way Wauw"
2738.12,2742.6," works, it's actually pretty clever on the PvP services. You're in a safe zone for your first 20 levels"
2742.6,2748.8399999999997," or so, but to do quests and get experience, once you hit a certain level of experience,"
2748.8399999999997,2753.72, you have to go into the PvP zones. So at any time you're going to be doing quests
2753.7999999999997,2758.12," that are involving NPCs in your normal, I got to kill a whatever, or so, whatever."
2758.7599999999998,2763.8799999999997," There could be players from the other faction who can kill you, so they can completely disrupt your"
2763.8799999999997,2767.48, gaming experience. You are what does essentially a single player game. That's what I would
2767.48,2772.12," play that. But, and there's a lot of people just like to play it just like that to that point, though."
2772.12,2776.8399999999997," We're not the poop stocking. You get to level 20 takes hardly any time. Actually, the poop"
2776.8399999999997,2781.0," stockings would have been afterwards. No, you can, I can't get anyone. If I went in that game,"
2781.0,2786.52," I couldn't gank you into a poop stock. No, that's not true. You could. Yeah, you could."
2786.52,2791.4," If you go into a PvP server, the PvP starts after level 20, which is not there for a poop stock."
2791.4,2794.12," So that's what we're saying. No, you don't need to poop stock to game."
2795.16,2799.0, How why are we having this? Why am I taking your bait?
2799.0,2803.64," You're talking about that. I just like, I don't know."
2803.64,2808.84," So if you're trying to do when you're playing these games is like, get the loot, get the stuff,"
2809.4,2814.84," you know, do the theme park stuff. Then PvP can be a really tough thing because there's going to be"
2814.84,2819.7200000000003, players like Sean Elliott who are just there to fuck with you and want to kill you. If you go
2819.7200000000003,2824.1200000000003," on to a PvP, be sure for a thought. If you do, to play against them, you'll start to have a"
2824.1200000000003,2828.36, classmate. But then that's then that's then you're going to have fun that way. If you go into a
2828.36,2832.92," PvP server, because when I was on the PvP server, there would be people on general sets,"
2832.92,2837.56," chats, I got them and I'm so tired of these dudes ganking me. Other people would write,"
2837.64,2842.12," you're on a PvP server, man. If you don't want to get gangred, this world will be a hero."
2842.12,2845.56," Oh, go, go, go. I want it to be a real one to a care bastard. I want to make a difference."
2845.56,2852.84," You're like, my hero when people keep fucking kill me. But when you're on a PvE server,"
2852.84,2858.04," like I am now, at times it almost feels like cheating in a way, because now I'm in zones in"
2858.04,2862.7599999999998," wow, that before we're hotly contested zones where it was a practically impossible to play the"
2862.7599999999998,2867.48, game regularly because you are always worried about the enemy. And now you see the same players
2867.48,2872.52," who you see, these orcs other players going by and you're just waving because you can't kill each other."
2872.52,2877.56," So it seems though, I mean, I was making fun of it. And honestly, it does seem fun to me to be able"
2877.56,2881.72," to jack someone else in the game. It is. But that seems much more fun to say, hey, even if you are"
2881.72,2885.96," one of the dudes who's getting mad because people are gay, and you say, hey, let's put together"
2885.96,2890.68," our own little team or let's hire a vigilante or let's all just agree to like, yep, like the"
2890.68,2895.32," kids in the South Park episode. Let's make this heroic. That's absolutely what happened. Yeah, to stop"
2895.32,2899.1600000000003, these like that's why that episode was so funny because that is what I was going to do.
2899.1600000000003,2903.1600000000003," And then you guys are just in line for the day of trial, prior to the career."
2903.1600000000003,2905.56, But people different people are playing different ways.
2905.56,2908.92," Watch, you're coming here. Here's where the pirate waves. No, you're right. You're going to"
2908.92,2914.76, burn the beacle moon. The dog that keys a trail clear to the dragon you fight.
2914.76,2920.28," Well, I could argue that that's what my slice two is to. That's all half life too. That's true."
2920.28,2925.0," It's just well, it's right. But as far as you can, no, because some of those sometimes when you do"
2925.7200000000003,2929.8," in in at points and half life too, it's like the pirates come off with their little"
2930.52,2934.76, posts and we'll do something that that Walt Disney himself didn't type into the old.
2934.76,2939.4, Like what? Every made every school that's seen plays out exactly the same way.
2939.4,2943.8," No, but I mean, when the, it's like the president's not the part of the game. But then it will"
2943.8,2947.48," do something different. So, say, for example, you put in a fast moving zombie, right?"
2947.48,2952.52," Isn't Raven Hall, I'm not able to climb buildings. Where, where and when they enter the game"
2952.52,2957.56," world, we'll be part of the Disney ride. But what they do after that moment is not part of the,"
2957.56,2961.16, is not part of the ride. They can do it would be like the rogue employee in the theme park who
2961.16,2966.6," could decide he wants to like kick your ass when he's wearing them. You know, you don't know what"
2966.6,2970.84," he's going to strike, but he's out there looking for you. Yeah. Yeah. Different people play"
2970.84,2975.8," while for different reasons, but, but the truth is, you can go on to a PVP server and just play the"
2975.8,2980.04," game and there are, you know, thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who play it for that"
2980.04,2984.52," reason to kill other people, right? You know? Well, it's worth the PVP thing. I mean, one thing I"
2984.52,2988.84," thought about as, especially with with wow is there aren't really that many RPGs out there."
2988.84,2994.04," And then people think are need a one of fix for it. And so, you know, some don't mind the PVP people,"
2994.04,2998.92," I love it personally. But PVP stuff, it's for those who just want like misplaying RPGs. That's what"
2998.92,3002.92," that's what I see in the least. Right. I mean, I, when I'm playing World of Warcraft, I'm mostly playing"
3003.0,3008.28," it as I would play a single player RPG. And I just, in less other people to play with me for the"
3008.28,3013.16," quest that require more than one person. But as in that, I don't want to be bothered with the PVP. Yeah."
3013.16,3017.0," So this is a whole care bearing thing. I think I don't, I don't quite, I don't quite buy into the"
3017.0,3021.0," care bearing thing, but I think it's more like people who misplay RPGs. Well, what's interesting,"
3021.0,3025.8," the phenomenon going on in Burning Crusade right now in the Outlands area, which is the post-level"
3025.88,3032.2000000000003," 60 area, even on the PVP servers, because all of these new zones are accessible to both"
3032.2000000000003,3037.2400000000002," hoard and alliance. And even on the PVP servers, there's a phenomenon going on there now of people"
3037.2400000000002,3043.6400000000003, not ganking. So even the PVP servers have been turning into kind of care-bear areas because all of the
3043.6400000000003,3048.44," players are seeing these quests for the very first time ever. When you're level 60 in while,"
3048.44,3053.0800000000004, you've already seen everything a million times. So ganking comes this part of is like with boredom.
3053.16,3057.4," That's right, exactly. And all the, any of the kinds of games I play is like right for the first"
3057.4,3061.24," few months I'm playing a game. I'm not, I don't know. I don't. Right, exactly. And that's what's"
3061.24,3065.08," happening in life. When you played the shift kind of it. Yeah, and it's just not so much fun just killing"
3065.08,3070.7599999999998, Bobby G. You just get on to the most of you. You can't even afford a microphone. That out.
3070.7599999999998,3076.68," Dude, your name's G money and you don't even have a microphone. Come on, dude. Come back, come back,"
3076.7599999999998,3084.3599999999997," make it. But for now, she's a real story, too. I played G money many times. He's on Xbox."
3084.3599999999997,3090.6," You find them on PC games. What do you make? I mean, the same guy. I mean, thanks to G money."
3090.6,3098.04," I mean, just like something dog, DAWG, dog or something pitbull. Red dog?"
3099.3199999999997,3101.96," Okay, we have a, do we have any more questions here before we sign off?"
3102.68,3106.84, This is just kind of a hostile podcast here. We got a not hostile. It's just doing my thing.
3106.84,3110.92," Fisey shit. That's okay. Fisey. It's fighting. Yeah, you're just briefing me. Friendly briefing. All right."
3111.56,3115.2400000000002," I'm going to bring it on more next. What you know, that would you, and she'd only bug you."
3115.2400000000002,3119.32," You're like, you already pointed out there's a dude who poop sock battlefields. Kind of yell"
3119.32,3125.08," for poop sock and warcraft. No, it doesn't bother me. And like it does stand that like a gun,"
3125.08,3128.76," like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like, we're all better. Like we're always"
3128.84,3133.4," win over your like plus five like fireball. Yeah. Well, like other other than that,"
3133.96,3139.4," we're like equally like, you're out. I would rather say that we're, we're just a, and I'm going to argue with you."
3139.4,3145.8, That that's a given right. I'm taking the fireball man. Okay. You're gun. You're
3145.8,3150.92," conventional weapon rate. You will for lipstick protect all that. Well, just use a face changing particle."
3150.92,3158.6000000000004, Exactly. Chains meet your album. It's in magic. Beats reality. Dude. Sorry.
3159.4,3163.4, Okay. Next question. Or are we done care rare games suck. All right. Next question.
3163.4,3167.48," Yeah. This is thanks for chiming that in. Yeah. And changing the subject. Um,"
3167.48,3171.4," okay. Yeah. Last word. Thank you. Maybe the, okay. This will be the last question. This is from"
3172.1200000000003,3177.88," no effects. DKY. I have no idea how to pronounce. No, effects. No, that we play with that guy. I have"
3177.88,3181.8," a line a lot too. We do. We know it's not how you say his name, but we call him no effects. Kiki. No,"
3181.8,3189.2400000000002," no, fix the game. Okay. And this is a question about our work days. How much time a week is"
3189.2400000000002,3193.32, a lot to playing games? How much choice are writing? And how much to other works just setting up
3193.32,3197.96," meetings and exclusive with developers. Oh, it's also does a lot of the review and works fill"
3197.96,3201.7200000000003," over into your free time at home, especially with a link your game to the oblivion. It answered"
3201.7200000000003,3206.84, that with one sentence. We get an hour each week to make fun of you and we're using it. We're almost
3206.92,3211.96," three minutes. Yeah. We're almost done. The answer to the last part of the question is yes,"
3211.96,3217.7200000000003," of course, the review time totally spills over into our, uh, what did he call it? Our free time and"
3217.7200000000003,3222.84," home time. Yeah. I mean, there's a snow. There's no way it for it not to. You cannot contain all"
3222.84,3227.88," stuff that needs to happen inside eight hours. And I don't know about you clowns, but I hardly get"
3227.88,3233.48," any gaming done that, that GFW. And I need to just not really be any writing done here. I end up"
3233.56,3238.76, doing it. I do. We don't game. I do a whole lot of it. I don't have time to write it because it's
3238.76,3244.04, all like logistics stuff like making lots of logistics. All the day everyone's got their stories
3244.04,3249.32," come in, making sure I got the assets for meetings. There, you know, they're setting up cover"
3249.32,3254.52, stories for the next issue after that and one after that same thing for stories. Yeah. It's like
3254.52,3260.28," like a lot of traffic cops. I feel like we're kind of like, I feel kind of like, uh, I can't"
3260.28,3263.6400000000003," think of those like Wall Street brokers, always on the phone saying, bye, seller always"
3263.6400000000003,3267.48, kind of like a wheeling feeling stuff. We're getting articles in. We're arranging articles for the next
3267.48,3272.1200000000003," month. We're editing. We're laying out articles for the current issue. I mean, there's also like,"
3272.1200000000003,3277.2400000000002," you know, concurrent issues, at least for me going on at once. Right. I mean, arranging for covers"
3277.2400000000002,3281.5600000000004," down the line. And there's different phases of editing too. I mean, there's like the text comes in."
3281.5600000000004,3285.8," We edit it. It comes back from caught. I mean, it's laid out on the page after it had an art pass."
3285.8,3289.48, And at which point we're editing again. We're also looking at art issues and it's going back.
3289.96,3293.48," So there's just a ton of different things that happen. And usually like,"
3294.52,3297.88," if I have any kind of distraction, like that's more difficult for me to write. So I just said,"
3297.88,3301.8," not doing, you know, like, it. Yeah. Do it in the evening. Yeah. Most of most of my running. If you"
3301.8,3306.12," want it to really know what it's like to work here, you should watch ugly Betty or volunteer to intern."
3306.12,3313.48, Because we're a lot like the fashion magazine and ugly Betty. Really? Exactly. Except we're all ugly.
3314.44,3323.08," Right. We're all Betty. No. Yeah. I mean, what what frustrates me, and actually about the gaming,"
3323.08,3326.36," because especially because we always get that. Sadie, it does play games all day."
3326.36,3331.0, Which is the standard question. Is we really don't. And what frustrates me the most about that is we
3331.0,3336.12, never play multiplayer games together. I tried to do it now. Yeah. We tried to do it. It never
3336.12,3340.68," were a time timing always sucks. One of us always in some other friends meeting now. I take on,"
3340.68,3345.08," like, well, you can only do one versus four, but I'll take on four of you guys at company heroes."
3345.08,3350.2," Oh, big man. Actually, you know what? I want to get you to play. You know what? You know what?"
3350.2,3357.08, I want to try a group sock that I better. I want to try general delu at a retirement and have
3357.08,3361.24, a face of a vest you. I think you would kick your ass. He probably would. I'm new to this whole
3361.24,3367.0," artiest thing. He was saying he took us all on him. I'm not asking delu. That's like,"
3367.56,3373.32," I was challenging you and you know, brother is cousin who's in the Marine Corps. No,"
3373.32,3382.04," but he could face your ego body. He took on like six people once. I'm sure he's just,"
3382.04,3386.84," just wasn't age two or he always hated too and he killed everybody. Oh, it was painful. And"
3386.84,3390.92," our strategy at the time could never get out of the like Stone Age, you know, if you had an"
3390.92,3396.28," age, you know, aging up game and you're like, you know, you guys get a shooting weapons. Like,"
3396.28,3399.96," yeah, because we even playing for three hours. You're the strategy editor. You're fucking fired."
3402.28,3405.7200000000003, You go do his plays. He's just Stone Age and you got pretty much. Yeah.
3405.7200000000003,3408.76," Yeah, stuff. Yes, but he has a health room. Sure. If you're going to shoot me with a gun. Yeah,"
3408.76,3414.6800000000003," sure you're going to win. Yeah, this is the straight leveling up. Hold on."
3416.36,3420.76," Yeah, he's done like a little Jesse. But actually, you know, that kind of part of that is"
3420.76,3424.84, that the staff saw a lot smaller back then. We had a big staffs of playing multiplayer game.
3424.84,3428.36," Yeah, that is big. It's helping with the staff. 14."
3428.36,3433.0, Four cheese. Yeah. We're five strong right now. 14. When I started there were
3434.0400000000004,3440.36, nine eight nine editors. Wow. Yeah. They started death Matt server and they would actually be like a
3440.36,3445.1600000000003," death match. And right when it be like, you know, three of us picking our noses and waving."
3445.24,3446.52, Hi.
3447.48,3451.7999999999997," Well, like now. Yeah. If we try to get a DM going to be like, where are you guys at?"
3451.7999999999997,3455.7999999999997, Let's all disagree to meet over where the rock spawns may have will see some action.
3456.68,3460.8399999999997, Yeah. Want one. I remember playing battlefield two together. That was about the last
3460.8399999999997,3464.44," time. And then. That's good. And together. Oh, that's right. That's when you were crashing"
3464.44,3468.12," helicopter. So, oh, yeah. That was fun. Yeah. That was good. It's like you keep congratulations"
