50.480000000000004,52.160000000000004, It's not really a secret.
52.160000000000004,53.160000000000004, Is it?
53.16,56.16," No, no, no, no, no."

64.16,66.16," No, Bhabita this week either."
66.16,70.16, We tried to get Chris from Boyer from EGM on but he was too busy.
70.16,73.16," Yeah, we're going to have Chris been auditioned for six months."
73.16,75.16," Yeah, all this."
75.16,76.16, Seven.

79.16,80.16, Bobito has a six.
80.16,82.16, Chris been his going for seventh.
82.16,84.16, Do you guys watch house?
84.16,89.16," Yeah, I think he's a house right now because he fired this whole staff from last season's gone."
89.16,90.16, He had three.
90.16,93.16, And so this season as I think the old three are going to come back.
93.16,97.16, But right now they're doing this extended thing where he's like trying to get a new team together.
97.16,101.16, He's got this room of like 50 that that he has assigned to different things.
101.16,104.16, So that's what I think I think we need like 50 chairs in here.
104.16,107.16, Just we just like fill the room with like reality show.
107.16,108.16," Yeah, W R."
108.16,109.16, We have a lot of guests.
109.16,110.16, It's all about that show.
110.16,111.16," Yeah, all in this room."
111.16,112.16, Yep.
112.16,115.16, So we are the old actor still like on the show.
115.16,116.16," Yeah, they're showing up."
116.16,118.16, They'll be on the right.
118.16,120.16, Like a big dance shoe for 12 chair.
120.16,123.16, Like that South Park runner looking for a Kenny replacement.
123.16,124.16, You want to play the part.
124.16,125.16, But what role?
125.16,129.16, I ripped the fourth chair leg from your butt hole from role drum roll.
129.16,131.16," Wow, that was good."
131.16,134.16, That was something we've done.
134.16,136.16, So yeah.
136.16,138.16, So we're here.
138.16,141.16, I know that Mr. Elliot has played some opposing fronts.
141.16,142.16, I've been playing more.
142.16,144.16, I played some last week too.
144.16,148.16," But the hard thing I'm about talking about that game, there's always there for one."
148.16,152.16," There's always this circumstance where we have for, yeah, not everyone on staff is playing."
152.16,153.16, Great.
153.16,155.16," And people always, or not always know what I'm adding to it."
155.16,157.16," Yeah, just me talking about some shit."
157.16,158.16, So there's that.
158.16,160.16, And then there's this other factor.
160.16,165.16," And that's where's I'm super confident with FPS isn't talking about, you know, the bounce."
165.16,168.16, And just the way that they're put together in the quality of everything.
168.16,169.16, RTS.
169.16,172.16, I have a more limited perspective.
172.16,177.16," And I think it's, and I'm always just, it seems dangerous to make these sweeping, you know,"
177.16,183.16, pronouncements about balance and issues and things like that because what happens more often than not is you start
183.16,185.16, biction about something or some tactic.
185.16,188.16, And really you just didn't search the internet hard enough for a counter to make it.
188.16,189.16, We could just go.
189.16,191.16," They did that five years ago in Starcraft, Sean."
191.16,192.16, Right.
192.16,193.16, Way to go.
193.16,194.16, So some expert.
195.16,197.16," Yeah, you're either a walk-hands-yclap idiot or an idiot."
197.16,198.16, Yeah.
198.16,199.16, Yeah.
199.16,200.16, No one between.
200.16,207.16," It's kind of a timid to play and feel like, you know, when people ask for my take on it, it's like, I can only really give you, you know, what it's like for me to play and why I'm interested in it."
207.16,208.16, Right.
208.16,212.16, You've got me into despite the fact that having traditionally played games in that genre.
212.16,213.16, Yeah.
213.16,214.16," So it was kind of your gateway, wasn't it?"
214.16,215.16, To our classes.
215.16,216.16, Yeah.
216.16,219.16," Well, as it was like, you know, I played Warcraft 2 way back when in like my classic story of"
219.16,224.16," playing with that Star Wars RTS, I forget which one, but it had like seven resources to farm."
224.16,226.16," Oh, it was just a black thick battleground."
226.16,227.16," Yeah, disgusting piece of crap."
227.16,228.16, The one.
228.16,229.16, Yeah.
229.16,230.16, That's the one.
230.16,231.16, Yeah.
231.16,232.16, Yeah.
232.16,233.16, That wasn't a rip off.
233.16,234.16, It was too long.
234.16,236.16, It was a gosh off.
236.16,237.16, It was like part.
237.16,240.16," But this isn't, you know, this is an awesome game."
240.16,241.16, It's an awesome series.
241.16,244.16, I kind of wondering how well it's doing.
244.16,246.16, I haven't seen too much hype.
246.16,248.16," Well, then I mean, it's just been out for a week."
248.16,250.16, It just came out and it's bad timing.
250.16,253.16," The same same as in Quake Wars, which is another fantastic game."
253.16,257.15999999999997," And it's like, how we are kind of on my nails."
257.15999999999997,259.15999999999997," You know, it's for Quake Wars."
259.15999999999997,260.15999999999997, So isn't that weird?
260.15999999999997,262.15999999999997, That seemed unexpected to me.
262.15999999999997,263.15999999999997, There's some buzz.
263.15999999999997,265.15999999999997," I think, but it's kind of like stealing it's thunder."
265.15999999999997,268.15999999999997, Team Forchers is stealing everything's thunder right now.
268.15999999999997,270.15999999999997, The other thing is that the beta was out for a while.
270.15999999999997,275.15999999999997, So people kind of like went through that phase with the beta of Quake Wars of Quake Wars.
275.16,276.16, Right.
276.16,280.16, And I also think that like that game in particular really came out too late.
280.16,284.16, I'm not like writing it off and I can't wait to get playing with the part of the reason
284.16,288.16," I've been playing it as much as I should is because you know, I play with a freelancer"
288.16,291.16," and friend of mine, Rory Manion and he doesn't have it yet."
291.16,293.16," And it's like, you know, we get on team speaking."
293.16,295.16, We start shooting the shit and we're going to play a game if he doesn't have it.
295.16,297.16, Then we're just going to go and play.
297.16,299.16, What do you mean they came out too late though?
299.16,300.16, What do you mean they came out too late though?
300.16,303.16," I just, I was really of the mindset that it was supposed to come out last all day"
303.16,304.16, and had it.
304.16,308.16, It would have been up against Battlefield 2142 or the two would have been out at the same time.
308.16,310.16, And it would have really visually.
310.16,311.16, Is it that late?
311.16,312.16, It's definitely.
312.16,314.16," Yeah, it's been, it don't make for a long time."
314.16,320.16, And it just seems like then it would have had basically the market almost all to itself.
320.16,324.16," And or any time earlier this year when, you know, you know, how if you look back at"
324.16,328.16," GFW radios, there was a big stretch when I was talking about nothing but Battlefield 2."
328.16,330.16, And that was the game that I like poops talked nonstop.
330.16,332.16," Yeah, we weren't really listening to you then."
332.16,336.16," I was a little bit more at her, but you might remember hearing something about it."
336.16,338.16, So I was really looking for a replacement for that.
338.16,340.16, 2142 didn't do it for me.
340.16,344.16," It was an horrible game, but it just didn't have, it didn't have the legs for me."
344.16,347.16," And I really wanted, you know, something like Quake Wars to come out."
347.16,349.16," So that's why I think, you know, maybe it's, we'll see."
349.16,353.16," It could still, it could, it could still gather momentum here, right?"
353.16,354.16, It's only good.
354.16,358.16," It's just again to keep in mind that, you know, crisis with power struggle modes coming out"
358.16,361.16," Unreal, tournament three is coming out."
361.16,365.16," So you have, you know, other games in this category to play with."
365.16,368.16," And it's even been hard, you know, like right now what I do is I go back and forth"
368.16,371.16, between opposing fronts and team fortress two.
371.16,375.16," But on opposing fronts, I wanted to say, I hope it does well because their plans"
375.16,381.16," as stated, you know, very loosely, it wasn't like a set and stone road map for the future,"
381.16,385.16," but they want to, you know, look at the Eastern Front, the Pacific,"
385.16,389.16, basically all aspects of World War II and I'd love to see those games from them.
390.16,393.16," And what they put out with opposing fronts is awesome. I mean, I can't."
393.16,397.16," It really, you know, when I'm playing it, and it takes me so long to learn,"
397.16,402.16," I mean, race in, in, um, scare quotes because, you know, it's just another army in the game."
402.16,406.16," It takes so long to, to get to master them to the point where I'm comfortable,"
406.16,409.16," and I can go into a public game and from the beginning,"
409.16,413.16," not have these moments where I say, God, what the hell should I be doing right now?"
413.16,415.16, What should I be prioritizing these builds?
415.16,418.16, Do I need to go aggressive? Should I turtle?
419.16,423.16," Where's when I, I could still load up in this game, the American or the original, uh,"
423.16,430.16," Axis army, um, and, and do those, but so it's a total learning process and what I was thinking about is,"
430.16,434.16," like, you know, how they're done a war? How many classes, how many races are they up to now?"
434.16,438.16," Uh, they're up to, uh, seven or nine."
438.16,441.16," That's just, I think it's going to be nine by the time solsterems come."
441.16,444.16," Yeah. That just seems ridiculous to me. Like, God,"
444.16,448.16," and it's so hard. I really don't know how they do it. Well, they gave it to pronounce them and they"
448.16,451.16," make them unique at the same time, you know. Yeah. They gave it a good, I mean,"
451.16,454.16," because I called them on it when we, when we did the preview for that,"
454.16,458.16," because, you know, that was one of the guys answers to me on the fond was like,"
458.16,462.16," you know, it was kind of like, you know, but, but this goes to 11."
462.16,466.16," It was a little bit like that, you know, like, you know, all game has nine races."
466.16,469.16," Right. And that was kind of like, you know, why is nine,"
470.16,473.16," well, all game has more races. He's not even English."
473.16,474.16, I don't know why.
474.16,475.16, I'm sorry.
475.16,476.16, I'm sorry.
476.16,479.16, My name is hard. Our game has more races than any other RTS.
479.16,481.16, No other RTS has done nine.
481.16,483.16," I was kind of like, why is that good?"
483.16,486.16," Very good. Like, starcraft has three."
486.16,487.16, Uh-huh.
487.16,489.16, And it's like the best RTS ever.
489.16,490.16, And it's like some more of the virus.
490.16,494.16," So you know, when you throw in, and they get to the point where there's like 24 characters."
494.16,497.16," And it's like, well, it's fine. There's only five that people play when they won."
497.16,502.16," Right. But he, but he had good counter arguments to it, you know, that, that, that,"
502.16,508.16," you know, the races evolve out of, I mean, the races are a real one from the Warhammer universe."
508.16,509.16, So they're not making them up.
509.16,510.16, Right.
510.16,516.1600000000001," But they're added to the game for, you know, for what they offer new to the gameplay."
516.1600000000001,518.1600000000001, And then that actually helps them rebound.
518.1600000000001,520.1600000000001," See, other ones to actually be even more unique."
520.1600000000001,522.1600000000001, That was his argument.
522.1600000000001,523.1600000000001, Yeah.
523.16,529.16, So it's matter stripping away at attributes of one race and a plan to say that one of the other new ones.
529.16,532.16," So it's kind of, but so far, there's none of that."
532.16,535.16," I mean, they're so in company here as a posing front,"
535.16,542.16," the, the British and the panzerily armies are so different from one another and so different from the two original armies."
542.16,547.16," That's really crazy. And it's like, I mean, it's just taking me time to get competent with them again and"
547.16,552.16," define, you know, I was looking up some rush strategies for the British and one particularly devious attack deck is long."
552.16,556.16," As a tactic, as long as you're playing against the vermark is opposed to the panzerily because"
556.16,563.16," basically what happens is when you, when you start your game, you have your HQ area and you have different types of"
563.16,568.16," the original German army has machine gun, putness that defend it."
568.16,573.16, But then the other guys have these flat cannons and that's part of the reason why you can't do this rush strategy.
573.16,577.16, But you basically take a person out carrier immediately into their backfield.
577.16,584.16," And because with a captain in the thing, you can call for everyone to retreat to the captain instead of your HQ."
584.16,589.16," So what happens then is you get as many units as you can, you know,"
589.16,594.16," Tommy soldiers to race through and since they're running at full retreat speed, they run right past the machine gunness"
594.16,599.16, and then you get them inside their back area and then have them dig trenches where they're almost unstoppable.
599.16,605.16," And if it's early enough in the game, then you just start setting up base right on right on their doorstep."
605.16,608.16," Oh, literally, and that kind of stuff spawn."
608.16,610.16, The single player is definitely cool too.
610.16,615.16, I've only been playing a little bit of that other to say that the voice work for the this time.
615.16,621.16," Instead of subtitling the German, they actually have English with the German accent on it."
621.16,624.16, And some of it's just really kind of hoogens heroes.
624.16,628.16," Some of it is, yes, some of them sound, I couldn't tell if they were supposed to be V-Shi or Wuppet."
628.16,631.16," Some of them sound wrench, but I don't think it's intentional."
631.16,636.16," And there's just some weird, you know, like, brought out, do you see them coming down?"
636.16,640.16," Like, it's just, you know, I mean, it's all very,"
640.16,641.16, or awesome.
641.16,644.16," I know he's Austrian, but you know the Bruno character from Oligy."
644.16,645.16," Yeah, sure."
645.16,647.16, It's very much like they're all Bruno.
647.16,650.16, Why do they did it that way?
650.16,651.16, I don't know.
651.16,653.16, Maybe people just weren't feeling it.
653.16,654.16," Tom, they passed me a brothel."
654.16,657.16," Yeah, they couldn't read it in the first one."
657.16,659.16, Yeah.
659.16,661.16, Tell the Allies not to invade yet.
661.16,663.16, I have Shaisa.
663.16,666.16," Yeah, maybe they got complaints about the subtitles."
666.16,672.16," Why are these, they're squiggly lines on my screen when I'm trying to play on the,"
672.16,673.16, on the other note on that game.
673.16,678.16," And I do want, like, that's something I want to find people to play with from, you know,"
678.16,680.16, our listeners and our message boards and stuff.
680.16,684.16," Because when you do, like, forverses, for battles, the game isn't the same."
684.16,686.16," But the trick is it's just not getting,"
686.16,689.16," I mean, because people are of such uneven board, you're level four."
689.16,690.16, Yeah.
690.16,694.16," And that's a lot of people crazy in that game, especially with all that artillery."
694.16,699.16," I mean, with the V1 rockets and, I mean, there's just so much destruction."
699.16,701.16," I can't imagine the crazy, big people."
701.16,704.16, Armor graveyard ever in the middle of the map.
704.16,711.16," But because people are of uneven skill levels, the problem is, as you get a group of guys that are just,"
711.16,713.16, don't just cream you.
713.16,716.16," I mean, there's a couple of guys that I played with too, a shout out to listeners,"
716.16,719.16," draws in his brother and this other guy left,"
719.16,720.16, kills me.
720.16,723.16," If you play with them on your team, it's pretty much like a comp stop."
723.16,726.16," Like you're just guaranteed to annihilate the other guys, because they're that good."
726.16,731.16," That even if you're not pulling up your end of the bargain, they'll just rush over and rescue you."
731.16,733.16," Like, yeah, hopefully could find a bunch of other people there."
733.16,738.16," Not super confident, you know, in their abilities yet and get some good games going."
738.16,741.16," I'm not done multiplayer, bar T.S."
741.16,743.16, Gaming in a long time.
743.16,745.16," So, that's the best."
745.16,747.16, What was the last one?
747.16,751.16," I think like age two, honestly."
751.16,752.16, Wow.
752.16,753.16, It's weird.
753.16,756.16, Like I never play single player RTS.
756.16,757.16, Really?
757.16,758.16, You only play online.
758.16,759.16, That's a multiplayer.
759.16,761.16," When I buy an RTS, that's all I have multiplayer."
761.16,763.16, What's the last one you played multiplayer?
763.16,765.16, You mean single player?
765.16,767.16, Single.
767.16,768.16, Yeah.
768.16,769.16, Single player RTS.
769.16,774.16, I think I played was a game I reviewed called No Man's Land.
774.16,777.16, That was why I played this single player.
777.16,778.16," No, I played this single player."
778.16,780.16, Because I was no one to play multiplayer.
780.16,781.16, We're no.
781.16,784.16," I mean, you know, I had to play the single player because I was really in the game."
784.16,786.16," Otherwise, I wouldn't have touched it."
786.16,789.16," You know, I've never, I played like a few missions in Warcraft 3."
789.16,791.16, Never finished the campaign.
791.16,792.16," You know, for example."
792.16,796.16," So, what's your favorite multiplayer RTS in?"
797.16,803.16," I would, well, I haven't, you got it in one in a while."
803.16,807.16," The last one, the last one I played at any light was Rizer Nation's."
807.16,808.16, Rizer Nation's.
808.16,809.16, That was because I was good.
809.16,810.16, I was great game.
810.16,815.16," I'm really psyched for the next age expansion because it's by the,"
815.16,816.16, Rizer Nation's guys.
816.16,817.16, Right.
817.16,818.16, The big huge games guys.
818.16,819.16, It's pretty good.
819.16,821.16, The buzz is good.
821.16,822.16, Good stuff.
822.16,824.16, Yeah.
824.16,825.16, Yeah.
825.16,826.16, Yeah.
826.16,827.16, You guys should play some comedy here as with me.
827.16,828.16, Yeah.
828.16,829.16," No, I want to play."
829.16,832.16, I just played the whole first game again to get ready for this.
832.16,834.16, So it's all about.
834.16,835.16, Second line.
835.16,836.16, So much fun online.
836.16,837.16, That's the other reason too.
837.16,840.16, Why people are waiting for us to talk about world and conflict.
840.16,841.16, I know.
841.16,842.16, I played that beta.
842.16,844.16, It's like that's just like yet another game now.
844.16,847.16," I'm, you know, you only have so many, you only have so many hours."
847.16,851.16, The promise I need a AI because the AI is always stupider than me.
851.16,852.16, Right.
852.16,853.16, One of the other people.
853.16,854.16, Yeah.
854.16,855.16, Can't so zoom.
855.16,856.16, I'm going to lose.
856.16,860.16," And again, like we said this before is like the difference is that you go into an RTS online."
860.16,861.16, You either win or you lose.
861.16,862.16," Well, yeah."
862.16,863.16, And it's hard to feel good.
863.16,864.16, Or you disconnect.
864.16,865.16, No matter how yet.
865.16,867.16, Option three.
867.16,869.16, But you still lose when you disconnect.
869.16,870.16, Yeah.
870.16,871.16, Yeah.
871.16,872.16, You'll market that with the loss.
872.16,873.16," But, but yeah."
873.16,875.16," I mean, when you lose in an RTS, it sucks."
875.16,877.16," It's not like, I'll play you again."
877.16,879.16," It's like, it's pretty crush them."
879.16,880.16, They're analyzing.
880.16,881.16, Yeah.
881.16,882.16, Very demoralizing.
882.16,885.16," And I think it's just to back in age of, I think it was age of M.Pars."
885.16,889.16, It was the game where the game wouldn't be officially over the other guy when it
889.16,893.16, get the victory until like every unit was dead of yours.
893.16,894.16, Right.
894.16,895.16, Or you surrender every single unit.
895.16,897.16, So I went out and near the end out.
897.16,899.16, We signed a couple units in the corner.
899.16,900.16, It's crazy.
900.16,902.16, The things we take for granted now.
902.16,903.16, I know.
903.16,904.16, I'm not quit.
904.16,905.16, I'm not dead yet.
905.16,907.16, Did the same victory for you did it.
907.16,908.16, We're a cracker.
908.16,909.16, You got one P.O. on the show.
909.16,910.16, And I'm building houses.
910.16,911.16, Exactly.
911.16,912.16, I think it was a good one.
912.16,913.16, It's crazy.
913.16,916.16, It took as long as it did to find the solutions to these things.
916.16,919.16, I remember at a time a dreamcast football came out.
919.16,921.16, I think it was one of the two K football games.
921.16,923.16, And it had this thing where you're playing online.
923.16,925.16, And you could pause it indefinitely.
925.16,929.16, And the first person to leave with loot would catch the list.
929.16,931.16, So people would just do these bullshit waste games.
931.16,933.16," We're, oh, I'm down by 14."
933.16,934.16," Well, guess what?"
934.16,935.16, I got to go take a shit.
935.16,936.16, Then I got to go make dinner.
936.16,937.16, Then I got to pick the kids up.
937.16,939.16, Then I got to go shopping.
939.16,941.16, And then I'm going to see if you're still paused.
941.16,943.16," And you know, I've heard tales of people waiting."
943.16,944.16, Wow.
944.16,945.16, I guess they get the big tired days.
945.16,946.16, Yeah.
946.16,948.16," You know, the big on pause."
948.16,954.16," So it's kind of weird that, you know, it's just, like, how and how does that stuff happen?"
954.16,957.16," That's what's interesting, you know, to transition to TF2."
957.16,959.16, Because we're going to say a little bit more about that.
959.16,963.16," How you can tell the difference now where it's almost, it's so far it's seemingly almost"
963.16,965.16," X-play, X-play proof."
965.16,968.16, Because they've been around the block so many times.
968.16,972.16," They know immediately like, okay, we don't want people getting here in the map and this"
972.16,980.16, And that although I did just recently get word or something I want to try tonight where you can build a teleporter in such a way right on the
980.16,984.16, The border of your spawn eggs that you'll lock everyone in your spawn.
984.16,988.16, Which is funny because that was like the first things that we tried in the fortress of the river.
988.16,993.16," And in fortress forever, you can lock people in with a century guns in your spawns."
993.16,997.16," And I guess someone, um, someone had that going."
997.16,1000.16," It's also screenshots, it looked pretty fun."
1000.16,1005.16," But you wouldn't mean locked in like, like, so you know, you start in your spawn room."
1005.16,1013.16," And for whatever reason, the way that the teleporter goes down, like right on the border, because normal, you can't build inside of your"
1013.16,1014.16, Re-supply.
1014.16,1017.16," Yeah, but you get it right on the fringe and it lets you build."
1017.16,1021.16," And then I guess you stand on the teleporter, you don't move."
1021.16,1025.1599999999999," And for whatever reason, no one else is able to get outside."
1025.16,1028.16," Huh, and there's no friendly fire, so."
1028.16,1032.16," Because it's gonna become as it gets you, then you go, but if they don't, sounds rad."
1032.16,1034.16, And you have captive audience.
1034.16,1037.16, That's bad.
1037.16,1038.16," They'll fix it, you know."
1038.16,1040.16," Yeah, sounds like they'll totally pass that."
1040.16,1041.16, Just no doubt.
1041.16,1044.16," They've been, they've been tweaking back in so frequently."
1044.16,1045.16, It has the pyro.
1045.16,1050.16, The pyro's still so tough.
1050.16,1054.16," You know, some people are asking for tips."
1054.16,1056.16, I want some more pro tips.
1056.16,1057.16, Right.
1057.16,1058.16, From thoughts.
1058.16,1059.16, I can give you guys a few.
1059.16,1063.16," Well, I cue the 144 just two tips, music."
1063.16,1066.16," Oh, thanks."
1066.16,1070.16," One thing is like, to general for people who play spies,"
1070.16,1073.16, There's like a few things that people don't know.
1073.16,1078.16," And it's funny because like by saying these, I'm kind of preventing the, I'm kind of,"
1078.16,1081.16," I mean, for however many people listen to this, and actually play the game,"
1081.16,1082.16, which is probably very few.
1082.16,1085.16," I'll tell you, we'll stop doing this dumb behavior."
1085.16,1088.16, I'm about to describe that let's make you so easily.
1088.16,1091.16," If you, whenever you go through a teleporter, you have, you know,"
1091.16,1095.16," your team colored particle effects kind of trailing behind you,"
1095.16,1098.16," teleporter, teleporter, mojo effect."
1098.16,1101.16," And so, if a spy goes through a teleporter,"
1101.16,1104.16," even if he disguises the other team, say you're red team,"
1104.16,1106.16," and you see a teammate running around the blue shit,"
1106.16,1108.16, channeled by him.
1108.16,1110.16, But what do you know?
1110.16,1111.16," Yes, what?"
1111.16,1114.16," Then you shoot him, and then he screams, how the fuck did you know?"
1114.16,1117.16," Well, that's one way, you know, so anyway, so if you're playing spy,"
1117.16,1120.16," and you're going to use teleporter, you should always check first,"
1120.16,1122.16, make sure that you're clear of that.
1122.16,1123.16, That's super basic.
1123.16,1124.16, That's like one of ones by.
1124.16,1126.16," Other things that people just, you know,"
1126.16,1128.16," is they want to go spy, I was like, you know,"
1128.16,1132.16," it's talking Robert Ashley because they see you get crazy kills and crazy points on it,"
1132.16,1134.16, and then they go spy and then how do you do it?
1134.16,1136.16, Everyone just shoots me the second eye here.
1136.16,1137.16, Yeah.
1137.16,1140.16," So the trick so far at the skill level,"
1140.16,1142.16," I'm playing spy at now, and I'm sure, you know,"
1142.16,1146.16," ask me again in two weeks, and maybe I'll have revised my tactics."
1146.16,1150.16," But you never want to, again, I apologize to the,"
1150.16,1152.16," to the, to the, die hard TF2 players,"
1152.16,1154.16," because this is all, no brainer stuff,"
1154.16,1156.16," but I'm sure they're quite a few people that don't,"
1156.16,1158.16, that don't know these things.
1158.16,1161.16, You always want to cloak and try to get behind the enemy.
1161.16,1163.16," You never want to approach them from the front,"
1163.16,1165.16, especially if you're in disguise.
1165.16,1167.16," So what I'll generally do, say if I'm,"
1167.16,1169.16, I want defense.
1169.16,1171.16, That's another thing.
1171.16,1173.16, Spies very effective defensive class.
1173.16,1175.16," Everyone tends to think of it as offensive,"
1175.16,1177.16, because you want to go when it takes out century guns and stuff.
1177.16,1179.16, But say we're on Dustball or something.
1179.16,1183.16," I'll go spy and I'll use my invisibility and timing,"
1183.16,1185.16," so that no one sees me,"
1185.16,1186.16," not even in a disguise,"
1186.16,1188.16," and I'll get all the way up to their thing,"
1188.16,1189.16," and I'll go right behind their spawn,"
1189.16,1191.16," and then I'll come out of cloak,"
1191.16,1193.16," and I'll go right when no one's looking,"
1193.16,1195.16," and just go with the hurt,"
1195.16,1197.16, because they're all running out.
1197.16,1199.16," At that point, they're less likely to spy check you,"
1199.16,1200.16," which is basically in shoot,"
1200.16,1201.16," you can see if you bleed,"
1201.16,1203.16," then if you come running at them,"
1203.16,1205.16," from the front of the field,"
1205.16,1206.16," then it makes no sense,"
1206.16,1207.16," say your disguise does,"
1207.16,1209.16," maybe it will for a sniper or something,"
1209.16,1211.16," but if you're, if your disguise is heavy,"
1211.16,1213.16, heavy's don't go running back field.
1213.16,1215.16, So that's another thing.
1215.16,1216.16," But then at that point,"
1216.16,1217.16," you get them lined up,"
1217.16,1219.16," and especially if the rest of your team is holding them back,"
1219.16,1221.16," and they're all focused forward on going up field,"
1221.16,1223.16," then you just chop your way through all of them,"
1223.16,1225.16," because they're all looking forward,"
1225.16,1227.16, and it takes a minute before they realize what's happening.
1227.16,1229.16," And again,"
1229.16,1231.16," save up your invisibility,"
1231.16,1233.16," so that as soon as you know,"
1233.16,1234.16," it looks like the gig is up,"
1234.16,1236.16," you go invisible and hide and relocate,"
1236.16,1238.16, and wait it out again.
1238.16,1239.16," Certain times,"
1239.16,1240.16," if you don't have enough,"
1240.16,1242.16," it's like don't be afraid to use your Magnum,"
1242.16,1244.16," it's totally effective weapon,"
1244.16,1246.16," say if an engineer spots you,"
1247.16,1249.16," and you're at medium range,"
1249.16,1251.16," and it's his shotgun against your Magnum,"
1251.16,1252.16," like bile means if you're a good aim,"
1252.16,1254.16," go for it, you'll probably win."
1254.16,1256.16," If it's a pyro though, and he's close,"
1256.16,1257.16," I mean pretty much anyone,"
1257.16,1258.16," you never want to get close,"
1258.16,1260.16," that's like the rule never get close to a pyro,"
1260.16,1263.16," but you're pretty much dead already,"
1263.16,1264.16," and that's the other thing to spy,"
1264.16,1266.16, like just do not ever go near them.
1266.16,1269.16," I mean, maybe you can go for some backstabs,"
1269.16,1271.16," but because all they have to do is spam their flame,"
1271.16,1273.16," and if you're invisible, it'll set you on fire,"
1273.16,1275.16, and you're not everyone's gonna be shooting
1275.16,1276.16," at you anyway,"
1276.16,1277.16," and heavies are another trick,"
1277.16,1278.16," they're great to stab,"
1278.16,1279.16," because they're slow to turn around,"
1279.16,1283.16," but if they do suspect you in the field invisible,"
1283.16,1285.16," like I said before,"
1285.16,1286.16," every time they hit,"
1286.16,1288.16," anytime anyone hits you in your invisible,"
1288.16,1289.16," it silhouettes you briefly,"
1289.16,1291.16," and because that gunfire so many shots,"
1291.16,1293.16, you basically are not invisible.
1293.16,1295.16," So that's a good technique,"
1295.16,1297.16," going back more advanced is like,"
1297.16,1299.16," if you're wondering,"
1299.16,1301.16," I guess this engineer technique at the same time,"
1301.16,1302.16," because they're both, you know,"
1302.16,1303.16," opposed classes,"
1304.16,1306.16," engineers, you always want to build some place,"
1306.16,1307.16," where you can have your back to a wall,"
1307.16,1309.16," so you don't get stabbed in the back,"
1309.16,1311.16," or you can have your back to your own dispensary,"
1311.16,1312.16," even better yet,"
1312.16,1313.16," and if you're crouch down,"
1313.16,1314.16," you're getting healed,"
1314.16,1315.16," and getting ammo,"
1315.16,1317.16, and you're banging on your SG.
1317.16,1319.16," Meanwhile,"
1319.16,1320.16," you never want to just go up,"
1320.16,1321.16, and you're just gonna give engineers
1321.16,1323.16, points by throwing sappers on shit
1323.16,1324.16," that they're banging on when you can't stab them,"
1324.16,1326.16," so you always want to kill them first,"
1326.16,1328.16, and if you kill them from such a position
1328.16,1332.16," that their gun has to turn a significant amount,"
1332.16,1334.16, you have time to do your stab
1334.16,1336.16, and quickly go invisible.
1336.16,1338.16," Then you put your costume on,"
1338.16,1340.16," and then you come out of invisibility,"
1340.16,1342.16, and then you put the sappers on.
1342.16,1344.16, Yeah.
1344.16,1346.16," I'm listening to you,"
1346.16,1348.16, but I'll just never play this just nonsense.
1348.16,1349.16," No, it's not nonsense."
1349.16,1351.16, It's just not for you.
1351.16,1354.16," No, it's just too hard for me."
1354.16,1356.16, I can't do it.
1356.16,1358.16, You're playing medic with this last time.
1358.16,1359.16," I was playing medic,"
1359.16,1361.16, and I learned to love the medic.
1361.16,1362.16, You missed it last time.
1362.16,1364.16," I couldn't play it even when I wasn't on your server,"
1364.16,1365.16," and not think,"
1365.16,1368.16," I'm just being what I'm being like this guy's fluffer,"
1368.16,1369.16, or something.
1369.16,1370.16, I'm not that guy.
1370.16,1372.16," Let me hear you, sir."
1372.16,1373.16," But I,"
1373.16,1377.16," you know, on a map where it really is playing dustbow"
1377.16,1378.16," with these guys,"
1378.16,1379.16," and on a map where,"
1379.16,1380.16," you know,"
1380.16,1381.16," on offense,"
1381.16,1384.16, it can really make a difference in these all the different.
1384.16,1386.16," Keeping these guys,"
1386.16,1389.16, and the involnabellity is just absolutely key.
1389.16,1392.16," I was also finding that I was getting better scores,"
1392.16,1396.16," and not just better than my own other performances,"
1396.16,1398.16," but then like most of the team,"
1398.16,1401.16, I was ranking near the top of the ranking just by healing.
1401.16,1404.16," Right, because you're sharing points with the guys doing the killing."
1404.16,1405.16," Yeah, so,"
1405.16,1406.16, so I got into it.
1406.16,1407.16," I found it, you know,"
1407.16,1408.16, parasite.
1408.16,1409.16, A parasite.
1409.16,1410.16, Yeah.
1410.16,1411.16," Well, I kind of found it like,"
1411.16,1412.16," like Ryan, I agree."
1412.16,1413.16," I think it is a kind of a nice,"
1413.16,1414.16, or a symbiotic.
1414.16,1417.16, It's a nice gateway into this kind of game.
1417.16,1419.16," Yeah, you know,"
1419.16,1420.16," it's really nice,"
1420.16,1422.16, because you're not a gamer.
1422.16,1424.16, Right.
1424.16,1425.16," Well, the not aiming does help."
1425.16,1426.16," I mean,"
1426.16,1427.16," you have like,"
1427.16,1428.16," this wide, you know,"
1428.16,1431.16, you got the wide stretch where you just vaguely aim the thing anywhere.
1431.16,1432.16, It's a ton of a screen.
1432.16,1433.16," Yeah,"
1433.16,1434.16," There's a problem though,"
1434.16,1435.16," like,"
1435.16,1436.16," where we were in a Roya in our playing,"
1436.16,1439.16, which is like bitching about medics all the time.
1439.16,1440.16, Yeah.
1440.16,1441.16," Because of that,"
1441.16,1443.16, it seems like you get the least talented people.
1443.16,1445.16," Playing medics all the time,"
1445.16,1446.16, and it can be at Troscious.
1446.16,1448.0800000000002," because he think you've got one set and you're like,"
1448.0800000000002,1450.88," yeah, guys behind me, and all of a sudden he disappears and you're like,"
1450.88,1454.0800000000002," okay, he just had a 100% for his annual recharge."
1454.0800000000002,1457.44," And he's like, he either doesn't do it or he does it."
1457.44,1460.72," When there's nothing happening, yeah, where you run out and you're like,"
1460.72,1464.4," okay, let's take the flag and you go and you look and then he stops doing it and"
1464.4,1466.8000000000002, put it on like a sniper or something like that.
1466.8000000000002,1469.76," Well, there's absolutely strategy with that class like there was"
1469.76,1470.5600000000002, with everybody else.
1470.5600000000002,1471.2, Exactly.
1471.2,1475.6000000000001," You need to know when to use your euber, you need to know,"
1475.6,1476.32, it's not that hard.
1477.36,1480.7199999999998," Well, right, but I mean, you know, to save it for those key moments when someone's"
1480.7199999999998,1482.6399999999999, running back with a flag or not a flag.
1482.6399999999999,1485.36, It's useful to use a class of others and the heavy.
1485.36,1488.08," Well, right, like, bringing the lowest common denominator together,"
1488.08,1489.52, it's like the heavies and the medics.
1489.52,1490.1599999999999, I used it.
1490.1599999999999,1490.32, I used it.
1490.32,1491.52," I each other and they're like, yeah."
1491.52,1492.8, Right.
1492.8,1494.0, You learned my hand.
1494.0,1494.48, I had a problem.
1494.48,1498.8799999999999, I was playing medico heavy's like getting a new euber charge and then like
1498.8799999999999,1501.28, turning into a wall and shooting for the duration of the.
1501.28,1502.6399999999999," Yeah, well, yeah."
1502.6399999999999,1505.28," Well, right, you think that the social stupid people in the matter, what"
1505.36,1506.16," that's right, right."
1506.16,1508.72, I was used my my health.
1508.72,1513.6," I wasn't a Uber, but I just kept my health going on a sniper actually at one point."
1513.6,1517.12, And it was rad because the guy just stood that they kept trying to take them out.
1517.12,1521.04, He was picking people off one by one from far away and they couldn't get them because I kept them
1521.04,1522.24, fully charged.
1522.24,1526.48," If you do it on the, I had this insane run with like a medic who's playing,"
1526.48,1528.3999999999999," I forget his name, so I can't shout him out."
1528.8,1530.0," Maybe he was, I have candy."
1530.0,1533.6," I'm not sure, but um, I have candy."
1536.24,1538.56," But with the demo man, it's, it's just awesome."
1538.56,1542.8799999999999," That's a demo man, David, the general thing would be like, don't be afraid of using your"
1542.8799999999999,1547.6," pybons and don't just use them for the obvious like, you know, sticking them all in the capture point,"
1547.6,1550.3999999999999," use them offensively and, you know, when you're in a fight."
1551.12,1553.2," And yeah, can I ask you a damn question about that?"
1553.2,1554.16, Uh-huh.
1554.16,1558.56, Because I tried to play demo man for like one round for like a minute and a half.
1558.56,1561.6," And I just, what are the difference between the two kinds of"
1561.76,1569.12, the first is a grenade that will explode on direct impact impact impact impact impact impact impact.
1569.9199999999998,1573.6799999999998, That's actually a name of a sushi roll to play side go to and it's the
1573.6799999999998,1574.8799999999999, actually spelled that way.
1574.8799999999999,1581.52," So maybe that's where you pick impact on impact or on the second bounce, I think, or they just"
1581.52,1582.0, tweaked that.
1582.0,1583.6, They used to blow up on the second bounce.
1583.6,1587.84," I think now they don't, um, but so it's basically fire and forget, right?"
1588.8,1592.9599999999998," The way I play with that is obviously if you see a group of people in your far away,"
1592.9599999999998,1598.0," you just spam them into them or you give them the right lead, you get a sense for how fast they"
1598.0,1602.8," fly, which isn't very, um, and how fast your enemies moving, you can nail them and screws this"
1602.8,1603.52, that way.
1603.76,1607.4399999999998," The other, you fire them and then you detonate them with your mouth, your second mouse."
1607.4399999999998,1608.24," Oh, okay."
1608.24,1609.4399999999998, And they stick to things.
1609.84,1615.12," So, you know, the classic scenarios would be around a blind corner when they don't see them there."
1615.6,1618.3999999999999," And also, you don't have to just stick them on the ground."
1618.3999999999999,1622.56," You can stick them on the roof on the walls where people are less likely to look, especially roofs,"
1622.56,1624.4799999999998, because people just are used to looking else.
1624.4799999999998,1626.08, But they don't detonate to you detonate.
1626.08,1626.8799999999999, And then detonate them.
1626.8799999999999,1629.04, So you got to hide and not even proximate.
1629.04,1630.6399999999999," You have to, you have to trigger them."
1630.6399999999999,1632.08, So that's the second level.
1632.08,1637.28," People people get used to using the way you're saying, getting a safe distance and just waiting to hit the charge."
1637.28,1637.76, Yeah.
1637.76,1641.36," But what I mean, my actively doing is, you don't, it's not all or nothing."
1641.36,1644.2399999999998, You might just shoot one and detonate it because they're very powerful.
1644.32,1646.32, They're more powerful than the other ones.
1648.16,1649.2, I don't think so.
1649.2,1650.16, I don't know exactly.
1650.16,1651.28, I don't have the details.
1651.28,1651.76, Hmm.
1651.76,1652.4, I don't know.
1652.4,1653.1200000000001, You can't know.
1653.1200000000001,1653.92, I know they're powerful.
1653.92,1657.04," But so, you know, if a medic got you overcharged, that's another thing."
1657.04,1661.28," You want to tell the medic, it's like, hey, let me reload all my stuff first."
1661.28,1662.64, You don't have to do that with a heavy.
1662.64,1664.72, Or other just make sure he's got ammo because that's dumb too.
1664.72,1668.16, And a heavy gets the Uber and he's got nothing but shotgun and stupid like this.
1669.2,1673.36," But then you throw those and you see if people are retreating, you throw them behind them."
1673.4399999999998,1675.28, And they'll retreat into them and then you detonate them.
1676.08,1679.84, They only retreat from a demo man usually when you got it over.
1679.84,1681.04," Otherwise, they rush you."
1681.04,1684.3999999999999," Then you run backwards and throw them right at your feet and then as they run over them,"
1684.3999999999999,1686.0, or you go around a corner and throw them.
1686.0,1689.84," And in their mad rush to get at you, depending again on their class, then you blow them up."
1689.84,1694.4799999999998," But just like, I find they're super effective when you use them actively."
1694.4799999999998,1699.36," Where it's like, when you're in the middle of a duel, shoot them and blow them up and constantly do that."
1699.36,1702.9599999999998," Instead of like, I said, the R and nothing trap method, which is effective too."
1702.96,1704.8, But to do both.
1706.64,1708.48, The game is so great.
1709.28,1711.6000000000001, I'm still just totally loving it.
1711.6000000000001,1712.64, So you're like an emetic?
1713.2,1714.4, I am like an emetic.
1714.4,1715.04, I am.
1715.04,1716.56, I'm going to stick with it for a while.
1716.56,1718.24," Also, you know, it's one of those classes."
1718.24,1722.88, I guess it's just like a healer class and an MMO just not that many people want to do it.
1723.44,1728.32," You know, I mean, it was the rare server when I was bouncing around where the team would already have"
1729.28,1733.28," you know, enough medics that it would be super close for me to pick that class."
1733.28,1736.08," Yeah, most of the time it's like, oh, there's no medics that should probably be one."
1736.08,1736.72, Exactly.
1736.72,1737.6799999999998, That was my experience.
1737.6799999999998,1742.6399999999999," Pirate would be a decent offensive class, but just in that case, if you're if you're new"
1742.6399999999999,1747.4399999999998," pyro, especially avoid open areas and stay around in corridors, this is a part of my"
1747.4399999999998,1751.36," beef at the pyro's that, you know, clearly they say, well, we supposed to be good at close"
1751.36,1752.6399999999999, quarters combat.
1752.6399999999999,1757.52," But the way that every map design, they're almost all close quarters combat anyway."
1757.52,1757.92, Yeah.
1757.92,1760.08," They're all, you know, tunnels and hallways."
1760.08,1765.28," So any map looking, if you see, hey, here's a tight area just going there and hold your"
1765.28,1769.76," pyro's down and then as soon as they get out of range, switch to shotgun and finish them."
1769.76,1773.84," Yeah, most of the open areas are the kind of open area you want to try to cross as fast as possible"
1773.84,1775.44, to be out of like the sniper fire.
1775.44,1775.92, You right.
1775.92,1780.8," If you're good, yeah, if you're starting off pyro, just avoid those all together, find find your little"
1780.8,1784.08, rotten coves and where you can farm from under cheese and stay in there.
1787.52,1794.16," I definitely would encourage like if you've never played it at FPS shooter multiplayer, this one"
1794.16,1795.2, is so good.
1795.2,1800.8," I mean, I still think there's, there's no getting around the fact that there's, I mean,"
1800.8,1804.72, it's nowhere near the level of the most of the hard record ones like Counter Strike in terms
1804.72,1805.92, of punishing noobs.
1805.92,1806.92, Right.
1806.92,1807.92," Oh, no way."
1807.92,1810.24, But there still depends on the server you get on.
1810.24,1814.72," But you could certainly get, I mean, I was on a server last night with strangers."
1814.72,1819.04, The first time that I was playing medic and I had a good team that like it was clear that
1819.04,1825.28," I was new at it and there were actually like a couple patient guys who over, over voice chat,"
1825.28,1827.68, were actually not being dext to me.
1827.68,1829.48, That's because they probably knew who you were.
1829.48,1830.48, Yeah.
1830.48,1831.48, Yeah.
1831.48,1832.48, Yeah.
1832.48,1833.48, Aile man.
1833.48,1837.1200000000001," No, because that's not true because on that same server about two or three minutes"
1837.1200000000001,1839.72," in some guy wrote, do few suck ass."
1839.72,1840.72, Yeah.
1840.72,1841.72, Yeah.
1841.72,1842.72, Yeah.
1842.72,1843.72, Yeah.
1843.72,1848.8, On the team for just talk leads to another subject that will transition nicely.
1848.8,1854.04," So when you're playing that game, increasingly, we start, I start having these conversations"
1854.04,1859.92," where you're like, are you more likely to score a critical when you're outnumbered?"
1859.92,1863.16, Does the demo man's bottle do more damage when it's broken?
1864.0400000000002,1864.16, Yeah.
1864.16,1869.24, People saying that you can overcharge Century Gus.
1869.24,1873.0400000000002," So as we're playing and we're talking about these things, you know, so all credit goes"
1873.0400000000002,1874.2," to Roy, he coined the term."
1874.2,1877.6000000000001," He's like, that's a fucking old nerds tale."
1877.6000000000001,1881.76," And so the equivalent of like the old, the old wives tale, but for gaming."
1881.76,1885.96," So I was thinking about like, maybe you guys got some other cases because the classic"
1885.96,1889.8400000000001, example of the old nerds tale is in Diablo 2.
1889.8400000000001,1893.1200000000001, There's the chat menu and there's this gem on it.
1893.1999999999998,1897.52," And I guess everyone said, if you click this thing, like a thousand times, you get, if"
1897.52,1902.76," you're able to, before you had a limited time, then you get some kind of item or this"
1902.76,1903.76, or that.
1903.76,1907.12," And I guess to the point where there were spreadsheets proving out, you know, how it worked"
1907.12,1908.9599999999998, and stuff online and all this shit.
1908.9599999999998,1910.36, But it was total bonk.
1910.36,1912.4799999999998, It wasn't real.
1912.4799999999998,1919.3999999999999," And I figure like, especially in MMO games and art yet, any genre really, there's got to"
1919.3999999999999,1920.3999999999999, be something.
1920.4,1923.16," There's really those that have any element of chance, which is like where the critical"
1923.16,1924.16, hits come in.
1924.16,1926.52," Because then you get the casino, you get the gambler's mentality."
1926.52,1930.48," You know, when someone in scaces like my dad, he's like, I'm going to tell you how to play"
1930.48,1931.48, the slots.
1931.48,1934.16," You're like, whoa, back up a minute there."
1934.16,1937.16, There's only one way to play a slot.
1937.16,1939.52, It's like not to play it if you want to play it.
1939.52,1944.72," But yeah, then they start bringing up the stuff like, you know, the one on the corner is"
1944.72,1948.44, good or you got to do it after when it's a full moon or whatever.
1948.44,1949.44, Yeah.
1949.44,1953.52, You play Keynote and you got to use your birthday divided by whatever.
1953.52,1956.3600000000001, I had to friend who had convinced he had to re-let and figure it out.
1956.3600000000001,1957.3600000000001," Oh, yeah."
1957.3600000000001,1958.3600000000001, Yeah.
1958.3600000000001,1959.3600000000001, You got to play it like this and so the pattern.
1959.3600000000001,1960.3600000000001, You mean the batting.
1960.3600000000001,1961.3600000000001, Yeah.
1961.3600000000001,1962.3600000000001, Yeah.
1962.3600000000001,1963.3600000000001," And it's like, okay."
1963.3600000000001,1964.3600000000001, Wow.
1964.3600000000001,1965.3600000000001," All right, then."
1965.3600000000001,1966.3600000000001, And is he rich from re-let?
1966.3600000000001,1968.3600000000001," Uh, let me see."
1968.3600000000001,1969.3600000000001, No.
1969.3600000000001,1974.56," But we're, if you were to try it, he just doesn't want to be."
1974.56,1975.56, He could be.
1975.56,1978.88," It was based on, of course, like one lucky streak where he did that."
1978.88,1979.88, I got on one day.
1979.88,1982.68, So then that was like that was how you do it.
1982.68,1991.0200000000002," And that's like, you know, Skinner, old BF Skinner would get pigeons to do all sorts of"
1991.0200000000002,1998.5600000000002, bizarre behaviors by randomly dropping food into their area when they were doing something.
1998.5600000000002,2003.6000000000001," And of course, they, you know, without thinking or ever sub vocalizing or anything on"
2003.6,2009.36," some base level of pigeon brain, um, created a correlation between whatever their foot was"
2009.36,2012.8799999999999, doing or whatever they were doing in the food falling in and they're able to get them
2012.8799999999999,2015.48, to do all these bizarre things.
2015.48,2017.48, And then they'll just do them forever after that.
2017.48,2018.48, Right.
2018.48,2020.1599999999999, So why don't we do this for your friend at the roulette?
2020.1599999999999,2024.6799999999998," You use there that night and so whatever he wears the same, you know, same clothes goes"
2024.6799999999998,2025.6799999999998, there again.
2025.6799999999998,2028.12, So let's do that with Darren because he's not here today.
2028.12,2029.52, So let's pick on him.
2029.52,2032.8," Let's like find something every time he does it like, I don't know, I'll bring him"
2032.8,2033.8, to read for it.
2033.8,2037.04," Yeah, again, I'm a pack of M&Ms from the candy machine here."
2037.04,2038.04, That is the same.
2038.04,2040.04, Just drop it on his desk.
2040.04,2044.04," So every time Darren says something, you know, just to see if he still does it."
2044.04,2045.04, Wow.
2045.04,2047.56," Every time I bring up the agency, I get a pack of M&Ms."
2047.56,2048.56, It's something like that.
2048.56,2052.12, Skinner did that to me when I was a kid with fart dick and fart jokes.
2052.12,2053.12, Really?
2053.12,2054.12, Yeah.
2054.12,2056.32," Because that way, you still tell them."
2056.32,2057.32, Yeah.
2057.32,2061.88," Um, so what about other other old nurse tells you guys don't, you guys are drum blanks?"
2061.88,2066.2400000000002, The only one I could think of is the one that we did in CGW itself back years ago.
2066.2400000000002,2070.8," We did, uh, it was called like a 501 cheats."
2070.8,2071.8, What's the name of that?
2071.8,2072.8, That was our conversation.
2072.8,2074.08, And you put some bullshit in there?
2074.08,2079.1600000000003," The 501 cheat was a bullshit tip, which reminded me because of your deobl story."
2079.1600000000003,2081.6800000000003," It was, I forget what, it was a blizzard thing."
2081.6800000000003,2082.96, I forget what was added to time.
2082.96,2084.6800000000003, It was like Starcraft was out in Warcraft.
2084.6800000000003,2085.6800000000003, Three was coming out.
2085.6800000000003,2089.84, I forget whatever their next game was that was about to come out.
2089.92,2094.4," 500 and first cheat was if you like, I might have the game wrong and maybe it was"
2094.4,2099.2000000000003," sort of incorrect me, but let's say it was Starcraft and we are, the, the key was, if"
2099.2000000000003,2106.04," you go to the Starcraft menu and bring up the, the console and type us the certain thing,"
2106.04,2109.96, it will unlock the complete Warcraft three that's actually on the desk.
2109.96,2111.6000000000004," It was like F 10, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
2111.6000000000004,2112.6000000000004, It was something like.
2112.6000000000004,2113.6000000000004, Something like something or other.
2113.6000000000004,2114.6000000000004, And it'll bring up Warcraft.
2114.6000000000004,2119.2400000000002, Which was a complete ludicrous joke because Starcraft had been out for years.
2119.24,2122.7599999999998, And we were saying they're entire next game was sitting on the CD all this time.
2122.7599999999998,2125.64, And all you had to do was type the thing and you were going to get it.
2125.64,2126.7999999999997, So you created one.
2126.7999999999997,2128.0, So we made one up.
2128.0,2129.64, But then it was crazy.
2129.64,2136.2799999999997," We got so much angry male from people who thought like, I tried that and that didn't work."
2136.2799999999997,2137.2799999999997, I didn't get it.
2137.2799999999997,2138.2799999999997, Right.
2138.2799999999997,2144.3599999999997," And you know, and then our, our editor and chief at the time, who I loved, actually got"
2144.3599999999997,2148.2, upset because we put that in without telling him.
2148.2,2150.8399999999997, So we put that cheat in and then he started getting male.
2150.8399999999997,2153.04, It wasn't April Fool's issue where that wasn't April Fool's.
2153.04,2154.04," We just said, fuck it."
2154.04,2155.04, Let's just do this.
2155.04,2158.04, So we had 500 real cheats.
2158.04,2160.72," You're like, yeah, let's do a joke one."
2160.72,2165.6," So he found out that we, we made this one up and he calls us in, you know, closes door or"
2165.6,2170.7999999999997," or, it's like face is like red because he's angry and he's like, you have betrayed the"
2170.7999999999997,2171.7999999999997, readers trust.
2171.7999999999997,2175.52," Like betrayed their trust, they're just fucking stupid man."
2175.52,2179.4, Who would believe that?
2179.4,2180.8, So I absolutely want to hike it.
2180.8,2181.8, Yeah.
2181.8,2183.96, Egypt has done those on the cover of April Fool's issue.
2183.96,2184.96, Yeah.
2184.96,2189.48," I mean, the classic one with Street Fighter II and Shen Long and then the Sonic and"
2189.48,2191.44, Sonic and Knuckles and Smash Brothers.
2191.44,2192.44, Right.
2192.44,2197.56," But I like to despontaneously, you know, uh, it ones that generate organic."
2197.56,2198.56, Sure.
2198.56,2199.56, Yeah.
2199.56,2202.68, Like the Sasquatch and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas did everyone thought they were
2202.68,2203.68, seeing.
2203.68,2206.12, They thought there was a Sasquatch and then Woods.
2206.12,2207.12," God, I can't."
2207.12,2210.56," So we could ask, like if you're willing, we got out of the readers here."
2210.56,2211.56, Focus up.
2211.56,2212.56, We want to make one in our tails.
2212.56,2213.56, The old nerds tales.
2213.56,2216.2799999999997, There's just gotta be a million of them.
2216.2799999999997,2219.2799999999997, Then there goes that now and then turn out to be true.
2219.2799999999997,2223.12," The ones where it's like so bizarre and like there's no way that that, I mean, it sounds"
2223.12,2226.12," like a joke and then it turns out that it's, it's really right."
2226.12,2227.12, I'm still heard.
2227.12,2228.12, I don't know.
2228.12,2229.12, I can't verify this.
2229.12,2231.64, But I've heard that an astronauts call.
2231.72,2238.24," Drops were based on the name of your character in the time, like some kind of like"
2238.24,2239.96, combination of those two.
2239.96,2243.68," And the people I, you know, I talked to you was swearing that yeah, it was proven like"
2243.68,2246.3599999999997, they found the code and they showed that it to be true.
2246.3599999999997,2247.3599999999997, So maybe that's.
2247.3599999999997,2250.96, That's like when people play cards either with whether it's with other people or online.
2250.96,2251.96, Yeah.
2251.96,2253.8399999999997, And they like think that cards are like out to get them.
2253.8399999999997,2254.8399999999997, Right.
2254.8399999999997,2256.6," You know, another seven."
2256.6,2257.6, Fuck every time.
2257.6,2259.96," Well, that was you fucking game."
2259.96,2260.96," I mean, what's it called?"
2260.96,2261.96, On the can.
2261.96,2262.96," Yeah, that's right."
2262.96,2263.96, Yeah.
2263.96,2266.96, But that was proven.
2266.96,2268.96, That was proven to be kidding.
2268.96,2269.96, You're right.
2269.96,2270.96, I totally am.
2270.96,2271.96, I thought it was proven to not be true.
2271.96,2272.96," No, you busted me."
2272.96,2275.96," No, I proved it was because I kept losing."
2275.96,2276.96," Oh, I see."
2276.96,2277.96, There we go.
2277.96,2278.96, You're right.
2278.96,2279.96, I'm totally busted.
2279.96,2280.96, You're not dying.
2280.96,2282.96," Well, that's how it feels like have time and team fortress the criticals."
2282.96,2284.96, It's like they're out to get you.
2284.96,2285.96, Yeah.
2285.96,2286.96, I did.
2286.96,2288.96, I got a critical last night as a medic.
2288.96,2291.96, Taking out a guy with the with the saw.
2291.96,2292.96, And that made me so happy.
2292.96,2295.96, I was saying that before happy too before we.
2295.96,2297.96," Yeah, I was a heavy before we."
2297.96,2298.96, Before we turned it on.
2298.96,2299.96, Did you hit it?
2299.96,2300.96, Did you want hit a heavy one?
2300.96,2301.96, He hit it a heavy with the.
2301.96,2302.96, With the.
2302.96,2303.96, But that's what I was saying before we recorded.
2303.96,2305.96, There's some weird psychological thing.
2305.96,2308.96, If you're a medic in enemy territory.
2308.96,2310.96, Like I found at least in the short run.
2310.96,2312.96, Like guys won't shoot you.
2312.96,2314.96," That it's like, oh, it's a fucking medic."
2314.96,2315.96, And when I'm in a military.
2315.96,2316.96," I mean, not the."
2317.96,2320.96," I know I mean, in there in there zone in there zone."
2320.96,2321.96, Yeah.
2321.96,2322.96, Yeah.
2322.96,2325.96," I found that sometimes all like go in and they'll just like look at me like,"
2325.96,2326.96," Oh, it's a medic."
2326.96,2329.96, And I'm able to just like casually like take out the saws.
2329.96,2330.96, I'm just.
2330.96,2331.96, I don't know.
2331.96,2334.96, That must be because you weren't healing anyone because normally if you're healing someone
2334.96,2335.96, They go for you first.
2335.96,2337.96, They go for the medic first.
2337.96,2338.96, That it.
2338.96,2339.96," No, I've not."
2339.96,2340.96, I just did these kind of fight.
2340.96,2341.96," See, that's it."
2341.96,2342.96, They see you feed on these nuts.
2342.96,2343.96, Then they.
2344.96,2346.96, They like that.
2346.96,2352.96," No, I just was I did these like random kind of comocasi runs into the other side as medic."
2352.96,2354.96, Just to see what would happen.
2354.96,2355.96, Go on.
2355.96,2356.96, I wouldn't get mad at it.
2356.96,2359.96, Way farther than I thought I would get the needle guns pretty effective too.
2359.96,2360.96, It just.
2360.96,2362.96," Yeah, I like that they drop."
2362.96,2364.96," Yeah, the ark is kind of heard the."
2364.96,2367.96," Yeah, common to what kind of damage is that thing do I never use it."
2367.96,2368.96, It's pretty good.
2368.96,2369.96, It kills with it a few times.
2369.96,2370.96, I play it.
2370.96,2371.96, Yeah.
2372.96,2374.96," It's not. Yeah, I mean, you're shooting people with syringes."
2374.96,2375.96, Gotta be some potent in there.
2375.96,2378.96, It took me a long time to figure out what that gun was.
2378.96,2379.96," Oh, you couldn't tell."
2379.96,2380.96, A little pellet gun.
2380.96,2381.96, Thank you.
2381.96,2382.96, You couldn't.
2382.96,2384.96, You didn't look inside the and see the cylinder full of hybrid
2384.96,2385.96, Dermix figured out.
2385.96,2386.96," Now, we're see the hybrid."
2386.96,2388.96, I'm sticking to the wall when you miss.
2388.96,2390.96," I thought I was just dropping like little, you know, little."
2390.96,2392.96, You're telling yourself gun balls are used to.
2392.96,2393.96, You still playing it.
2393.96,2394.96, I thought that was the healing thing.
2394.96,2395.96, Thank you.
2395.96,2397.96, But then I figured that.
2397.96,2398.96, We thought this was a really good.
2398.96,2400.96, I thought like one.
2400.96,2401.96, They've shooting them.
2401.96,2404.96, And then you found out like you accidentally rolled your mouse wheel.
2404.96,2405.96, Oh.
2405.96,2409.96, Pretty much.
2409.96,2411.96, I didn't know any better.
2411.96,2412.96, Yeah.
2412.96,2413.96, Thank you.
2413.96,2416.96," Well, I saw people running around with this like blue"
2416.96,2417.96, A billacle court connecting them.
2417.96,2419.96, And it looked like they had the proton pack.
2419.96,2421.96, And I looked at the needle gun I had.
2421.96,2422.96," And I said, that's probably it."
2422.96,2426.96, So I'm going to shoot these at my phone.
2426.96,2427.96, You're going to shoot them.
2427.96,2429.96, So hopefully they didn't take long for better.
2429.96,2431.96," You know, there was another in that map."
2431.96,2434.96, You're playing last night that I don't know what the mode is called where you have to.
2434.96,2437.96, It's basically a capture the flag like you steal the attache case.
2437.96,2438.96, Yeah.
2438.96,2441.96, That there was a little graphic in there that to me was just one of those moments
2441.96,2445.96," who were like, oh man, they just so nailed the art style for this."
2445.96,2450.96," When you're carrying that that attache case, there's like pieces of paper flying out of it."
2450.96,2451.96, Yeah.
2451.96,2452.96," It's just such a, it's a little thing."
2452.96,2455.96, But to me it was like such a nice touch.
2455.96,2457.96," If you, um, it's a beautiful game."
2457.96,2462.96," If you play with ultra high textures or a full, which you should, I mean, that was with the last patch enabled."
2462.96,2468.96," So if your computer's up to it, like switch textures to ultra high, then you could read those papers."
2468.96,2469.96," Oh, yeah."
2469.96,2474.96," And they have the list of the maps available, but it also shows the next five maps that really"
2474.96,2476.96, Valve's going to release for the game.
2476.96,2481.96," When you look in the closet for the, the, what is it the lockers for the characters?"
2481.96,2482.96, Yep.
2482.96,2485.96," And his section, he's got a person there, a purse."
2485.96,2490.96," So there's like the, well, man, the, well, they don't know because you know, our characters all, you know,"
2490.96,2492.96, heavily suited up in the world.
2492.96,2493.96," Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
2493.96,2494.96, So maybe a girl.
2494.96,2498.96," Yeah, maybe it's a team fortresses first, first woman."
2498.96,2500.96, Kind of Samus around it later.
2500.96,2503.96," Yeah, this is a little, uh, heavily mailed this game."
2503.96,2504.96, Little sexist.
2504.96,2505.96, It is.
2505.96,2507.96, They could have made the heavy.
2507.96,2509.96, People all get mad about the demo man.
2509.96,2510.96, They're in fat one.
2510.96,2513.96, Demoman's racist because he's fucking scotch.
2513.96,2514.96, What?
2514.96,2516.96," I think we talked about this for a day, Javu."
2516.96,2520.96," Yeah, but people got all mad and they say that the demo man's racist because he has a,"
2520.96,2522.96, a Scottish X.
2522.96,2525.96," Yeah, actually there's no minority."
2525.96,2526.96, So it all right.
2526.96,2529.96, I'm sure the reason he does is because it's funny.
2529.96,2531.96, And then they avoid the problem.
2531.96,2535.96," Because instead of like having, you know, the one black character be like,"
2535.96,2538.96," Oh, you a bitch or some other like offensively stay into the thing."
2538.96,2541.96," They're like, well, let's just go the opposite direction."
2541.96,2542.96, All right.
2542.96,2546.96," Let's just like have them, you know, whatever, give them a man or an accent or like give, you know, give,"
2546.96,2548.96, give the Asian guy the Brooklyn accent.
2548.96,2553.96," You know, whatever, although there's no, I think the scout might be Jewish."
2553.96,2558.96," I'm taking maybe he, you know, he could be because he's kind of got that Brooklyn thing."
2558.96,2561.96," He's skinny, you know, he's got a paper, Mr. kind of thing."
2561.96,2563.96, I think he could be Jewish.
2563.96,2564.96, That's possible.
2564.96,2567.96," You can keep, you can keep thinking that maybe I just want to be represented."
2567.96,2571.96, I'm going to sign your own attributes to it.
2571.96,2574.96, So why don't we even therapy twice a week?
2574.96,2575.96, Just count them a little breaks.
2575.96,2576.96, Things about.
2576.96,2577.96, Okay.
2577.96,2578.96," Yeah, we'll take a break."
2578.96,2579.96, We'll be back.
2579.96,2580.96, All right.
2580.96,2581.96, Okay.
2581.96,2582.96," Three, two, one."
2582.96,2583.96, You're the best.
2583.96,2585.96, All right.

2600.96,2606.96, We've been a little on topic of PC games this week.
2606.96,2607.96, It's a little dismay.
2607.96,2609.96, Does that what happens when Darren's not here?
2609.96,2610.96, We stay on topic.
2610.96,2612.96," Oh, this is for you."
2612.96,2613.96, That talk about it.
2613.96,2615.96," And we had, yes, actually lots of games."
2615.96,2620.96," And it's like, we're, we're already racing to finish the next issue that we have two weeks"
2620.96,2621.96, to do.
2621.96,2622.96, So.
2622.96,2625.96, I don't know how to have much time to think about other.
2625.96,2626.96, This is kind of reversed.
2626.96,2628.96, I'm saying like now I've got it backward.
2628.96,2632.96, Like we got a prepared to go on the tangents from my talking about.
2632.96,2635.96, I need more time to think about how to go on top of my tangent.
2635.96,2637.96, Wow.
2637.96,2638.96, Yeah.
2638.96,2640.96," Well, maybe we got to give it a piece of what we got to do."
2640.96,2642.96," We've got to do a whole, we've got the cast."
2642.96,2643.96," We can, we can do that several times."
2643.96,2647.96, Join the peanut gallery of people talking about the Halo 3.
2647.96,2648.96, Make you go to church.
2648.96,2649.96," Oh, yeah."
2649.96,2650.96, That's a fun one.
2650.96,2651.96, Yeah.
2651.96,2652.96," Brian, do you have that news story?"
2652.96,2653.96, Start it up.
2653.96,2654.96, I didn't print it out.
2654.96,2655.96, It's got it.
2655.96,2656.96, Apparently.
2656.96,2660.96, This is from evil avatar.
2660.96,2666.96," And they say the New York Times has an interesting piece on Halo 3, specifically on how church groups"
2666.96,2671.96, are using the game as a tool to attract new members to the congregation.
2671.96,2676.96," The church is whole Halo night and stock gamers with the Emrated title, hoping to get young,"
2676.96,2677.96, perspective congregants into the whole.
2677.96,2679.96," Wait, it's not Emrated is it?"
2679.96,2680.96, Yeah.
2680.96,2681.96, There's no blood in it.
2681.96,2682.96, There's no blood.
2682.96,2684.96," There's no, you just kill muppets."
2684.96,2686.96," Anyway, go on."
2686.96,2687.96, Okay.
2687.96,2688.96, It's assumed it was Em for some reason.
2688.96,2698.96," The church is whole Halo 3 night and stock games with the title, hoping to get young,"
2698.96,2701.96, perspective congregants into the fold in the process.
2701.96,2705.96," Church officials compare the practice to old stand by the Protestant churches, including"
2705.96,2709.96," chairs and camping trips as tools to keep young people away from less wholesome, more"
2709.96,2712.96, dangerous activities.
2712.96,2713.96, Wow.
2713.96,2714.96, That's.
2714.96,2716.96, So it's a kind of bait and switch.
2716.96,2717.96," Yeah, that is."
2717.96,2718.96, A little bit.
2718.96,2720.96," Sean, you can reenact how that bait and switch goes."
2720.96,2723.96," Oh, so, uh, enjoy and handle there, son?"
2723.96,2724.96," Yeah, it's really fun."
2724.96,2725.96, It's really fun.
2725.96,2728.96," What you find there, you find what's the name of those creatures?"
2728.96,2729.96," Oh, that is it."
2729.96,2730.96, The flood.
2730.96,2732.96," Oh, do you know where the flood is from?"
2732.96,2734.96, I've heard of a flood before.
2734.96,2736.96," Well, I didn't fight in the covenant."
2736.96,2739.96," Like, let me tell you about another covenant."
2739.96,2744.96," I bet though, I bet that happened."
2744.96,2745.96, That probably does.
2745.96,2750.96," I've seen worse like watching, you know, like Trinity broadcasting network or some other, you know,"
2750.96,2751.96, evangelical TV show.
2751.96,2752.96, Yeah.
2752.96,2755.96, I saw this one guy stuffing himself with the candy bar.
2755.96,2757.96, Stuff in his fat face with the candy bar.
2757.96,2758.96, Just gobble in it down.
2758.96,2759.96, Is this wife sat next to him?
2759.96,2761.96," Like, oh, he's such a card."
2761.96,2764.96," And then he somehow, I don't remember the exact moral lesson he"
2764.96,2765.96, Transcendent to.
2765.96,2769.96," But it was something about like, you know, the milk and honey, you'll get, um, um,"
2769.96,2770.96, I don't know.
2770.96,2775.96," I've had something nice trek or or or some lesson about things in moderation or something, you know,"
2775.96,2777.96, it was just like the most messed up take.
2777.96,2779.96, Let's try a halo and do a parable.
2779.96,2781.96, When are you beat to the special spell for you or some kid?
2781.96,2785.96, And you you found out that this church which off was setting up a halo three land.
2785.96,2786.96, Yeah.
2786.96,2788.96," Like, I don't want to play that in church."
2788.96,2789.96," It's like, you know, you know,"
2789.96,2793.96," I mean, first of all, when you feel uncomfortable sitting in a church going, you fucking do"
2793.96,2794.96, a thing.
2794.96,2796.96, I love that guy alive.
2796.96,2797.96," Yeah, you got to be playing that."
2797.96,2798.96, That player.
2798.96,2799.96," Okay, that's a good story."
2799.96,2801.96, I went to a church camp one time.
2801.96,2803.96," And there's the same thing where, you know, like you're saying that like they"
2803.96,2805.96, specifically mentioned camp.
2805.96,2809.96, And we almost got kicked out of it twice just for running around the thing like
2809.96,2812.96," yelling at screaming and then at one point, you know, they had this little pond and we're in the"
2812.96,2816.96," canoes and we scraped up all the scum and slime, you know, that, that"
2816.96,2820.96, cameylaed's on the top of a lake and it filled our boat with that and then went and
2820.96,2824.96," pelted the, got the counselor dudes with it and their boat."
2824.96,2827.96, And so we're going to go almost got busted for that.
2827.96,2832.96," But then when night we were playing paintball in the desert, but we had wrist rockets to do it."
2832.96,2834.96, So we had Jesus camp.
2834.96,2835.96, Yes.
2835.96,2837.96," And we had, and I went with a friend."
2837.96,2840.96," We, you know, we had no protective gear on or anything."
2840.96,2845.96," So that, you know, considering that this wrist rocket was more than enough to make it hurt."
2845.96,2851.96," And we were playing in the night and it was, you know, just the Christian camp."
2851.96,2855.96," And this one dude was just, he was camping basically."
2855.96,2857.96," It was like, he was an F. Yes, dude."
2857.96,2858.96, Just camping.
2858.96,2862.96, And he would sit in the bush and hide by their flag and shoot you whenever.
2862.96,2864.96," And he kept on like, yeah."
2864.96,2866.96," And so finally,"
2866.96,2871.96," we were like, all right, just don't because it's an honor system."
2871.96,2873.96," You scream, hit when you get hit."
2873.96,2876.96," Most people are more than happy to, so they don't get hit anymore."
2876.96,2879.96," We're like, I'm just going to suck it up and rush this dude."
2879.96,2882.96," You know, like, he hit me as many times as he wanted and saying nothing."
2882.96,2885.96," I run up to him and then get him and it's like, all of a sudden."
2885.96,2887.96," So you guys are like, where's this going?"
2887.96,2888.96, They're going anywhere.
2888.96,2892.96," But so, okay, imagine we're playing with the counselors and it's all quiet."
2892.96,2895.96," It's the dead and night and the desert and all of a sudden you hear me yell,"
2895.96,2898.96, Got you mother fucker.
2899.96,2903.96, And then it got even more quiet.
2903.96,2905.96," Yeah, it was like now shine."
2905.96,2906.96, Just because I read it.
2906.96,2911.96, It took like four hits from this dude just like push him aside and hit him at point blank.
2911.96,2913.96, You got the flander's kids over there.
2913.96,2915.96, You don't use this word in Christian camp.
2915.96,2918.96," And then it was all bad, yeah, because as soon as it sounds like, oh crap."
2918.96,2919.96, What did I do?
2919.96,2924.96, I got I got drawn into one of those Christian camps during the summer.
2924.96,2925.96," Yeah, by my neighbor."
2925.96,2929.96, So it wasn't where it was weird because it was a Protestant one.
2929.96,2930.96, And we were in a group of Catholics.
2930.96,2932.96, So that was the big sticking point.
2932.96,2933.96," Yeah, so that Protestant camp."
2933.96,2934.96, We were in a few minutes.
2934.96,2937.96, And as soon as mom had to realize what Kings of the King was.
2937.96,2938.96, Kids of the King.
2938.96,2939.96," Yeah, kids of the King."
2939.96,2940.96," Yeah, kids of the King."
2940.96,2941.96, Wow.
2941.96,2942.96, Kids of the King.
2942.96,2943.96, That's the tail of the.
2943.96,2945.96," I mean, it's not the first time we've heard of the King."
2945.96,2947.96," We have y'all, children."
2947.96,2950.96, It's not the first time we've heard of the King.
2950.96,2951.96, It's a King.
2951.96,2952.96," You know, that's scary."
2952.96,2954.96," That was one of the guys who kept saying,"
2954.96,2955.96," we love y'all, children."
2955.96,2956.96, It was part of us.
2956.96,2958.96, I just remember some fool of talking in Babylon.
2958.96,2959.96," We love y'all, children."
2959.96,2961.96," It's like, no, man."
2961.96,2963.96, Try that to love me so much.
2963.96,2970.96," America's army was, well, actually, no, that's not true."
2970.96,2973.96, Because the game wasn't doing the recruiting.
2973.96,2975.96, It was people using the game to do recruiting.
2975.96,2977.96," This is, well, I mean, we've done it."
2977.96,2980.96," We did a story on that in the magazine before, where people will find"
2981.96,2984.96, online games in which to go on.
2984.96,2986.96, I'm trying to write a little term inside the game.
2986.96,2987.96," Yeah, Christians."
2987.96,2990.96, But that's different than what we're talking about here.
2990.96,2993.96, But it's kind of awkward because you still have to make that transition.
2993.96,2996.96," You still, you know, it's kind of like, what do you do when you're in the,"
2996.96,3000.96," you know, when you, so if you're playing battlefield or call duty or any of these things"
3000.96,3002.96," and you go into a Christian server,"
3002.96,3006.96," at some point, see a lot of people we spoke to."
3006.96,3008.96," They were saying, you know, it's very casual."
3008.96,3011.96," What happens is we create this, you know, fun environment."
3011.96,3014.96," And we, we maybe we won't proselytize in the server."
3014.96,3016.96, We'll get people to join our team speak.
3016.96,3018.96," And from there, we'll talk to them."
3018.96,3019.96, Sure. Like maybe all this.
3019.96,3021.96, But I've definitely been in somewhere.
3021.96,3026.96," There's like, you know, inspirational messages that will pop up on the server thing."
3026.96,3028.96," Now, and then you're playing."
3028.96,3031.96, And they'll kick you immediately if you swear something.
3031.96,3036.96," Instead of being like, like, hey, why would you, why do you use that language to express yourself?"
3036.96,3038.96," And you know, um,"
3038.96,3040.96," if they want to make a server or even a girl, right,"
3040.96,3042.96," where like they just want to hang out with people like my,"
3042.96,3043.96, I think that's all fair.
3043.96,3045.96," But then what is, what is, what is it?"
3045.96,3047.96," What is it though, you know, like, like,"
3047.96,3049.96, do you want to know about the real response?
3049.96,3052.96," You know, I mean, like, when they, when they go to that kind of,"
3052.96,3054.96," you know, when they go to that tradition,"
3054.96,3056.96," you know,"
3056.96,3058.96, are you ready for the final response?
3058.96,3059.96, Yeah.
3059.96,3060.96, Yeah.
3060.96,3061.96, Jesus is free.
3061.96,3063.96, He's probably free days.
3063.96,3064.96," You guys ever see that,"
3065.96,3069.96," that old Simpson's episode where they're at the Springfield Swatmeat,"
3069.96,3072.96," and like Barton, one of his other friends, go up to,"
3072.96,3076.96," to Ned Flanters, little table, and they're like,"
3076.96,3079.96," whoa, biblical training cards."
3079.96,3081.96," And then, uh, he's like,"
3081.96,3084.96," Matthew's in the rookie year, Joseph of Aramathia,"
3084.96,3086.96, 40-and-conversion and something AD.
3086.96,3089.96," And then all of a sudden, and then, uh,"
3089.96,3090.96," Flanters is like,"
3090.96,3094.96," see kids, these make learning about the Bible fun."
3094.96,3096.96," And then, um,"
3096.96,3099.96," and then, and then,"
3099.96,3101.96, now I've been like fucking Chris Rockshow.
3101.96,3102.96," I mean, Chris Farley Show."
3102.96,3103.96, That was awesome.
3103.96,3104.96, Remember that one?
3104.96,3105.96, There you go.
3105.96,3106.96, Learning.
3106.96,3108.96, Bible fun.
3108.96,3109.96, That was awesome.
3109.96,3113.96," Okay, so that's same friend from the Christian camp."
3113.96,3115.96," Oh, the guy who you, who I went with,"
3115.96,3118.96," and he was like, he wasn't feeling that either."
3118.96,3120.96, He is basically his parents split.
3120.96,3123.96," His mom was like super, um,"
3123.96,3125.96," you know, played a really big part in this church."
3125.96,3127.96," And like, so I don't offend any of our, you know,"
3127.96,3129.96," our Christian listeners, whatever,"
3129.96,3131.96," or even stating, you know, our own perspective on it."
3131.96,3134.96," This is very, very ultra right wing to the point that,"
3134.96,3136.96," you know, when you go to their church,"
3136.96,3138.96," first thing they do is hand out a flyer to you,"
3138.96,3140.96," and it'll tell you what your boycotting that week,"
3140.96,3142.96, and it would be anything from like Tyd's soap.
3142.96,3145.96," To be boycotting because they advertised on days of our lives,"
3145.96,3147.96," which featured a homosexual character,"
3147.96,3150.96," then 30 minutes into the sermon, you get a call,"
3150.96,3152.96," and it's their former pastor who's imprisoned,"
3152.96,3154.96," you know, for having bombed a clinic,"
3154.96,3157.96," calling in to preach to you about how,"
3157.96,3159.96," you know, even Paul was a prison,"
3159.96,3161.96," and he had spent time, you know,"
3161.96,3163.96," no less emphaliscent time in prison,"
3163.96,3165.96," and when he comes out, you know, he'll be back"
3165.96,3166.96, back doing this thing.
3166.96,3169.96," And so it was very, they're this little tub in the back,"
3169.96,3172.96, and this is a good set up for this.
3172.96,3174.96," Because now you get to know about his mom's temperament,"
3174.96,3177.96," and I tell you what we did, it'll resonate more."
3177.96,3180.96," So at one point, she made him go to the school there,"
3180.96,3182.96, and his dad now was massively secular.
3182.96,3186.96," He's one of the senior detectives for Escindito,"
3186.96,3188.96," police department in Southern California,"
3188.96,3189.96," and he got sick of it, he's like,"
3189.96,3191.96," I'm getting mad at it at the school,"
3191.96,3192.96, this is crazy shit.
3192.96,3194.96," When he heard about how they were beaten up and stuff,"
3194.96,3196.96," like they make him go look at the shed out the window,"
3196.96,3198.96," and they spank up, they have like some stick."
3198.96,3201.96," It's like the, the possible be good stick."
3202.96,3204.96, It's like they will appreciate with that.
3204.96,3205.96," So one day his dad goes in there,"
3205.96,3206.96," and he goes to principal,"
3206.96,3208.96," and he's like, get my son, get mad."
3208.96,3209.96," We're going, we're leaving,"
3209.96,3211.96," and the guy wouldn't, wouldn't do anything."
3211.96,3213.96," So he like, he just was like, okay,"
3213.96,3214.96, and then I'm gonna go walk.
3214.96,3216.96, And there's only like four classrooms here.
3216.96,3217.96," So he starts going down the halls,"
3217.96,3218.96," one by one, opening the door,"
3218.96,3220.96," and looking in and seeing if he sees mad,"
3220.96,3221.96," and then he finally gets to the one,"
3221.96,3222.96," and tells him like,"
3222.96,3223.96," all right, Matt, let's go."
3223.96,3225.96," And all the other kids are looking,"
3225.96,3227.96," and then I guess the teacher runs up,"
3227.96,3229.96, and then it's like trying to push the dad out.
3229.96,3230.96, You gotta get out of here.
3230.96,3232.96," And then the epic story,"
3232.96,3234.96," he's like, his dad just like,"
3234.96,3236.96," drop the blade him out at the punch,"
3236.96,3238.96, and then grab Matt up under his arm and left.
3238.96,3239.96, So teacher?
3239.96,3240.96," Yeah, he just got off."
3240.96,3241.96, So that's a dream called true.
3241.96,3242.96," Imagine if you're a student,"
3242.96,3244.96," like my dad just fucked you up, dude."
3244.96,3245.96, What do you say?
3245.96,3247.96, So that's kind of mean.
3247.96,3249.96," But then at one point,"
3249.96,3252.96," when we were staying at his moms for the weekend,"
3252.96,3253.96," we had to do like,"
3253.96,3255.96," like if I'd spend night,"
3255.96,3256.96," if we wanted to go play or something,"
3256.96,3258.96," first had to do all the chores,"
3258.96,3260.96, which was black because he was only there in weekends.
3260.96,3264.96, So we had to clean up dog shit and mow the lawn and all the stuff.
3264.96,3267.96," And then we had to memorize Bible verses,"
3267.96,3270.96," like me, too, just because if I stayed over."
3270.96,3272.96," And then we had to listen to like this program,"
3272.96,3273.96," and it was like this little machine,"
3273.96,3274.96," I think it's called salty,"
3274.96,3276.96," and like the kids are talking,"
3276.96,3278.96, talking about how you get this thing to work.
3278.96,3279.96," And they're like,"
3279.96,3280.96," you know, this will only,"
3280.96,3282.96, we can only get it to work.
3282.96,3285.96," If you praise God with all of your heart,"
3285.96,3286.96, and all of your might.
3286.96,3288.96," And then all of a sudden,"
3288.96,3289.96," Matt was like,"
3289.96,3290.96," oh no,"
3290.96,3292.96, we'll never get it to work.
3292.96,3294.96, Oh no.
3294.96,3295.96," Immediately,"
3295.96,3297.96, his mom came out.
3297.96,3300.96," And she was just like,"
3300.96,3302.96, stricken dumb.
3302.96,3305.96, It not believed what kind of monster she had raised.
3305.96,3306.96, Oh man.
3306.96,3307.96, How was that for a detour?
3307.96,3308.96, Wow.
3308.96,3309.96, That was quite a detour.
3309.96,3310.96, Were you double child though?
3310.96,3311.96, We're getting in some uncomfortable parents.
3311.96,3312.96, We are.
3312.96,3313.96, Yeah.
3313.96,3315.96, Let it be said though.
3315.96,3317.96," We're going to have to all our,"
3317.96,3320.96," religious listeners that were,"
3320.96,3323.96, were equal opportunity haters.
3323.96,3324.96, We'll make fun of it.
3324.96,3326.96," Oh, and the different,"
3326.96,3327.96," I mean,"
3327.96,3328.96," the whole point of my,"
3328.96,3329.96," my saying that,"
3329.96,3331.96," okay, there's a difference when your,"
3331.96,3333.96, pastors falling in from prison
3333.96,3335.96, because he was convicted of bombing shit.
3335.96,3336.96," And,"
3336.96,3337.96," you're every day,"
3337.96,3338.96," believer of whatever,"
3338.96,3340.96," here in whatever faith,"
3340.96,3342.96, like more than capable of knowing the difference.
3342.96,3343.96," And even like,"
3343.96,3344.96," you know,"
3344.96,3345.96," you know,"
3345.96,3346.96," like, yeah,"
3346.96,3347.96," yeah,"
3347.96,3348.96," there are many still this,"
3348.96,3350.96, this tactic of church using it.
3350.96,3351.96," I mean,"
3351.96,3352.96," whatever,"
3352.96,3353.96, I guess kind of more power to him.
3353.96,3354.96," It strikes me a little bit like,"
3354.96,3355.96," you know,"
3355.96,3356.96," you know,"
3356.96,3357.96," hey kid,"
3357.96,3358.96, you want some candy?
3358.96,3359.96, I don't know.
3359.96,3360.96," It definitely is,"
3360.96,3361.96," you know,"
3361.96,3362.96," oh, there's no doubt about it."
3362.96,3363.96," It's very,"
3363.96,3364.96," it's very bald,"
3364.96,3365.96," you know,"
3365.96,3367.96, just complacent video games.
3367.96,3369.96, And then we'll talk about something else.
3369.96,3370.96, It's a bait.
3370.96,3371.96, Right.
3371.96,3372.96," You know,"
3373.96,3374.96," it's a very,"
3374.96,3375.96, very kind of a big picture.
3375.96,3376.96, I see.
3376.96,3377.96, I see.
3377.96,3378.96," You know,"
3378.96,3379.96, I'm assuming these things were happening
3379.96,3382.96, within some sort of church building.
3382.96,3384.96, And it probably just happened to get the story.
3384.96,3385.96, It probably just happened.
3385.96,3386.96, It probably happened to the church.
3386.96,3387.96, I was just talking about.
3387.96,3388.96, Right.
3388.96,3389.96, That was it.
3389.96,3391.96, Now it's national news.
3391.96,3392.96, Right.
3392.96,3393.96, I'll see.
3393.96,3394.96, You got to wonder.
3394.96,3395.96," I mean,"
3395.96,3396.96," wouldn't there,"
3396.96,3398.96, you would think that a game like that would just kind of be counter.
3398.96,3399.96, I don't know.
3399.96,3401.96, Here's what you don't want to be doing kids.
3402.96,3403.96, Killing things.
3403.96,3404.96, I don't know.
3404.96,3406.96," I think you can have perspective and say,"
3406.96,3407.96, like what?
3407.96,3408.96," Well, they are a lot of muppets."
3408.96,3409.96," You know,"
3409.96,3410.96, this game.
3410.96,3411.96," I mean, it's not like flat zombies."
3411.96,3412.96, True.
3412.96,3413.96, Yeah.
3413.96,3414.96, Right.
3414.96,3415.96," I mean,"
3415.96,3416.96, that's just a love by me.
3416.96,3417.96, Not by alien.
3417.96,3418.96, It's a terrible way.
3418.96,3419.96," Yeah, but I mean,"
3419.96,3420.96," look, hey,"
3420.96,3425.96, that's why I thought was particularly kind of unfair.
3425.96,3426.96," Like for one,"
3426.96,3428.96, like if they're saying it's a mature idea game.
3428.96,3429.96," And I really do,"
3429.96,3430.96, I don't think it is.
3430.96,3432.96," If you go in there and you can read about,"
3432.96,3433.96," you know,"
3433.96,3435.96," Jeff does daughter or you can read about,"
3435.96,3438.96," I forget the famous conk you bind,"
3438.96,3440.96," who was cut and after being,"
3440.96,3441.96," you know,"
3441.96,3443.96," brutally raped was cut into X number of pieces by her,"
3443.96,3446.96," her family member and sent to the various tribes of Judah,"
3446.96,3447.96," uh,"
3447.96,3450.96, if you read the story of Sodom and go more of the story of the flood itself.
3450.96,3451.96," Hey,"
3451.96,3452.96," what's shooting some muppets,"
3452.96,3453.96, you know?
3453.96,3454.96, Right.
3454.96,3455.96," I mean, it's not like everyone knows."
3455.96,3456.96," It's, I mean,"
3456.96,3457.96, True.
3457.96,3458.96," It's not like the,"
3458.96,3459.96," particularly the Old Testament or even the story,"
3459.96,3460.96," the crucifixion,"
3460.96,3461.96," the crucifixion,"
3461.96,3462.96," aren't very, you know,"
3462.96,3463.96," you know,"
3463.96,3464.96," violent and powerful,"
3464.96,3465.96," you know,"
3465.96,3466.96," themes, you know?"
3466.96,3467.96," Yeah, I guess when you think about it,"
3467.96,3470.96, you could probably make a cool FPS set of some of the Bible stories.
3470.96,3471.96," Sadly,"
3471.96,3473.96, people already have already beat you to it.
3473.96,3474.96, Tamm it.
3474.96,3475.96, How do you say that one?
3475.96,3476.96, Tamm it.
3476.96,3477.96, Tamm it.
3477.96,3478.96, You say that one?
3478.96,3479.96, Tamm it.
3479.96,3480.96, Tamm it.
3480.96,3481.96, Tamm it.
3481.96,3482.96, Tamm it.
3482.96,3483.96, Tamm it.
3483.96,3484.96, Tamm it.
3484.96,3485.96, Tamm it.
3485.96,3486.96, Tamm it.
3486.96,3487.96, Tamm it.
3487.96,3489.96," Tamm it in the abstract edge of the century,"
3489.96,3490.96," this is the old one coming up again,"
3490.96,3491.96, or it also comes together.
3491.96,3492.96, It goes together.
3492.96,3493.96," You know,"
3493.96,3494.96," why don't you tell us,"
3494.96,3495.96," go post a book on a book there,"
3495.96,3496.96, when it starts
3496.96,3497.96," like,"
3497.96,3498.96, whatever one is something that will
3498.96,3499.96," write your mind here,"
3499.96,3500.96," Let it hear from you,"
3500.96,3503.2400000000002, let's will show off all of you on Central
3503.2400000000002,3503.96," solids,"
3503.96,3505.6, how many instrumental in religion to
3505.6,3505.96," read,"
3505.96,3506.96, all of it and
3506.96,3508.8, let it read from the name of the name of the name of the name of
3508.8,3511.0, or raised from all the top Children's
3511.0,3512.0, Adventure.
3512.0,3513.2, What would haze around of you.
3513.2,3513.96, Hmm?
3513.96,3514.96," It should be true as a,"
3514.96,3516.96," that is a flat aspicable sentence,"
3516.96,3519.7200000000003, Here we got an ever-quest movie.
3519.7200000000003,3520.56, Finally.
3520.56,3521.56, Excited.
3521.56,3522.56, Hmm.
3522.56,3525.16, Is this based on one of the 12 expansions?
3525.16,3527.2, What's the movie about?
3527.2,3528.16, I don't know.
3528.16,3529.16, It's about ever-questions.
3529.16,3531.96," It's the ruins of Koonark, the movie."
3531.96,3536.64," It's a that dude from Marvel Studios,"
3536.64,3538.2400000000002, who's producing it.
3538.2400000000002,3540.2400000000002," Wait, is this like a real thing?"
3540.2400000000002,3541.52, But what's a deal?
3541.52,3542.52, Talsa story.
3542.52,3543.96, There you go.
3543.96,3544.96, Sony.
3544.96,3546.28, Doos are with Gusto.
3546.28,3548.84, Sony is making it ever-quest movie.
3548.84,3552.44," The dude who wrote 300 Michael Gordon,"
3552.44,3554.2000000000003," well, who wrote 300 screenplay."
3554.2000000000003,3555.48," Yeah, the thing."
3555.48,3558.28," Yeah, is apparently writing it."
3558.28,3559.4," Okay, that's good."
3559.4,3560.28, That's right.
3560.28,3561.6800000000003," No, it's not."
3561.6800000000003,3563.1200000000003, Fucking lie.
3563.1200000000003,3563.96," You know what, it's good."
3563.96,3566.28, It's good even pretend to be even marginally excited about this.
3566.28,3568.96," Well, no, I'm just saying that's a good pedigree."
3568.96,3570.2000000000003, The guy wrote 300.
3570.2000000000003,3571.0400000000004, Did I?
3571.0400000000004,3572.7200000000003, Did I adapt to a graphic novel very little?
3572.7200000000003,3574.6400000000003, He shakes beer right in it.
3575.6,3577.2, Nothing's going to fix it.
3577.2,3577.8399999999997," Well, keep it."
3577.8399999999997,3579.64," Don't be a hater, read more."
3579.64,3580.64, I'm a hater on that.
3580.64,3581.64, All in one.
3581.64,3583.64," You said you're defending, and I want you to know,"
3583.64,3586.64," you're, you're piecing ever-quest the movie fan."
3586.64,3587.64, I've never quit.
3587.64,3588.64, Somebody has to.
3588.64,3593.3599999999997," And then, the reason we're talking about this is to make fun of it."
3593.3599999999997,3594.08, So it's cool.
3594.08,3594.92," No, we're not."
3594.92,3596.08," Yeah, well, I'm on to it."
3596.08,3597.08, That's right.
3597.08,3598.08, That's right.
3598.08,3599.3199999999997," Well, you guys are doing this."
3599.3199999999997,3600.08, You guys have a difference.
3600.08,3601.56, I hear the love.
3601.56,3604.24, So the big screen version of the massively popular
3604.24,3607.0, game has been in development for several years.
3607.0,3611.2799999999997," Yes, but Michael Gordon is the first scribe to take a crack at the material."
3611.2799999999997,3612.2799999999997, Awesome.
3612.2799999999997,3613.2799999999997, What does that mean?
3613.2799999999997,3614.7999999999997, He's going to give it a shot.
3614.7999999999997,3615.7999999999997, That means that he's going to develop.
3615.7999999999997,3616.7999999999997, What was it?
3616.7999999999997,3617.7999999999997, What was it?
3617.7999999999997,3618.7999999999997, What was the development?
3618.7999999999997,3619.7999999999997, It was in development.
3619.7999999999997,3620.7999999999997, The process.
3620.7999999999997,3622.68, Some prosthetics guy that listened to his mom's basement was making
3622.68,3624.0, trying to figure out the frog locks.
3624.0,3625.0, Yeah.
3625.0,3626.7999999999997, I want to do the frog locks.
3626.7999999999997,3627.7999999999997, Can't do this.
3627.7999999999997,3628.7999999999997, The frog locks.
3628.7999999999997,3630.7999999999997, What else does it say?
3630.7999999999997,3631.7999999999997, It's isn't the game.
3631.7999999999997,3634.2, Players created a character that you two explore the world.
3634.2,3635.2, The North.
3635.2,3636.2, It's true.
3636.2,3638.08, The interaction with other players are fight-off creatures.
3638.08,3639.68, We'll go on Quest for treasure.
3639.68,3641.2, The movie will be nothing like that.
3641.2,3642.2, Yeah.
3642.2,3644.2, Does it say like what is based on anything?
3644.2,3645.2, No.
3645.2,3647.2," Well, part of the universe."
3647.2,3648.2, No.
3648.2,3649.2, No one even gives a shit.
3649.2,3650.2, It's just a name.
3650.2,3651.2, It's just some random like pet.
3651.2,3655.2, It's probably made by the dudes from American movie.
3655.2,3656.2," You know, coven."
3656.2,3657.2, Yeah.
3657.2,3658.2, What's this guy?
3658.2,3659.2, It's Mark.
3659.2,3660.2, Mark.
3660.2,3661.2, Yeah.
3661.2,3662.2, Mark.
3662.2,3663.2, And I get him.
3663.2,3664.2, That was a great movie.
3664.2,3665.2, That's a fantastic movie.
3665.2,3666.2," Fuck, everyone."
3666.2,3667.2, Let's talk about that.
3667.2,3669.2, I want to know more.
3669.2,3670.2, Is there anything?
3670.2,3672.2," You keep reading, but you're not saying anything."
3672.2,3674.2," Well, that's kind of what the story is."
3674.2,3677.2, There are more words on the page you haven't read yet.
3677.2,3678.2, Yeah.
3678.2,3679.2, How could read them?
3679.2,3681.2, You just want to read the whole thing.
3681.2,3682.2, Yeah.
3682.2,3683.2, I have to read it.
3683.2,3684.2, I don't know.
3684.2,3685.2, Yeah.
3685.2,3686.2, Okay.
3686.2,3691.2," Sony online entertainment published the original version of the fantasy title in 1989,"
3691.2,3694.2, with a sequel following in 2004.
3694.2,3698.2, That request was the most popular online role playing game for 2004 before similar
3698.2,3700.2," games, as well as the Warcraft launch."
3700.2,3704.2," It's also a long-term major money maker for Sony because in order to play, you just"
3704.2,3707.2," must probably thinking you're in pay monthly feed, to first as a fake."
3707.2,3708.2, That is peak.
3708.2,3710.2, This title had more than 450.
3710.2,3711.2, That was for subscribers.
3711.2,3713.2, Pointing of $10 a month to fire.
3713.2,3716.2," We added this peak and had more than 450,000."
3716.2,3718.2," As one of the most popular games of this type of request,"
3718.2,3723.2," it's going to wrap it in different than the fanboy bloggers fear, particularly IGN."
3723.2,3726.2, Fanboy bloggers fear.
3726.2,3727.2, This is dangerous.
3727.2,3728.2, This is dangerous.
3728.2,3729.2, No.
3729.2,3731.2, This is a variety.com.
3731.2,3732.2, Oh shit.
3732.2,3733.2, Talk about something.
3733.2,3736.2," Something at a Blizzcon when they had their World of Warcraft panel,"
3736.2,3738.2, just resonated when we had no one.
3738.2,3739.2, Yeah.
3739.2,3740.2, It's an insane thing.
3740.2,3743.2," I think the audience just assumed that like,"
3743.2,3745.2," oh, World of Warcraft movie, instant money."
3745.2,3749.2," But he said, even if, yeah, all 9 million subscribers paid 10 bucks each,"
3749.2,3750.2, you don't write what?
3750.2,3753.2, 90 million dollars made and that's right enough to write.
3753.2,3754.2, Right.
3754.2,3755.2, Yeah.
3755.2,3756.2, He was right.
3756.2,3762.2," I mean, he was saying like, that's not our goal is not to make a movie for the World of Warcraft fanbase."
3762.2,3763.2, Because that's not enough.
3763.2,3766.2, We just want to make like a great frickin epic movie.
3766.2,3769.2," All he would so fucking had a bite is, that's pathetic."
3769.2,3770.2, You're making that shit.
3770.2,3772.2," I mean, it's no, it's not new."
3772.2,3775.2," It was like, of course, the Dungeons and Dragons movie that we all ripped on before."
3775.2,3777.2, The Dungeons Siege movie.
3777.2,3778.2, Remember they've done some series of games?
3778.2,3779.2, Yeah.
3779.2,3781.2," Well, before that, the Dungeons and Dragons movie."
3781.2,3782.2, I remember that.
3782.2,3783.2, The Dungeons and Dragons movie.
3783.2,3784.2, That was awesome.
3784.2,3785.2, Who did we all see it?
3785.2,3786.2, I saw it.
3786.2,3787.2, I did.
3787.2,3788.2, I did.
3788.2,3789.2, I saw it in the theater.
3789.2,3790.2, Yeah.
3790.2,3791.2," That was, I'm saying."
3791.2,3792.2, That we all went.
3792.2,3793.2, That had Jared.
3793.2,3794.2, I have some excuse.
3794.2,3799.2," I went, that was during my phase of life where I would see everything in the entire universe."
3799.2,3800.2, Yeah.
3800.2,3805.2," Like, you probably like dating someone and it was within the first like year of the relationship."
3805.2,3808.2, That phase when you see every movie that comes out of the movie.
3808.2,3809.2, Yeah.
3809.2,3810.2," Or yeah, we're in high school."
3810.2,3811.2, Yeah.
3811.2,3812.2, It was college.
3812.2,3813.2, Yeah.
3813.2,3814.2, We were anything.
3814.2,3816.2," Well, I'm trying to find something to grasp on through here with it."
3816.2,3818.2, Some saving grace of the ever-quest movie.
3818.2,3819.2, But I'm still done.
3819.2,3820.2, Don't even lie to yourself.
3820.2,3821.2, There's nothing about it.
3821.2,3822.2, Fuck that movie.
3822.2,3823.2, It shouldn't be made.
3823.2,3825.2," I mean, I've spent that play in a fucking worthwhile."
3825.2,3828.2," Like, fill in the seasonal aisle at right-aid with much of shit."
3828.2,3832.2, It just needs to be built inside the landfill.
3832.2,3835.2, So it doesn't have to go anywhere.
3835.2,3836.2, Don't waste build it.
3836.2,3837.2," Like, in the landfill."
3837.2,3839.2, Open up the factory in the landfill.
3839.2,3841.2, It'll eliminate the metal man who does it.
3841.2,3845.2," You're done pull the supporting fucking, so it's like instead of straight to 3D."
3845.2,3847.2, Straight to landfill.
3847.2,3848.2, Yeah.
3848.2,3852.2, The thing about everyone and I haven't played like the last 12 expandings.
3852.2,3857.2," But when I played it before, even the first expansion, the thing that struck me about it was that it was so generic."
3857.2,3858.2, Yeah.
3858.2,3862.2, I had no idea what the story was when I was playing out at all.
3862.2,3865.2, And I think that was kind of the thing that we're going for.
3865.2,3867.2," It was just like, this could be any fantasy."
3867.2,3869.2, This is your fantasy.
3869.2,3873.2, So like to turn it into like some movie with a plot.
3873.2,3874.2, Yeah.
3874.2,3876.2," I mean, say we know that we want to work around it."
3876.2,3878.2, At least they have had a story all along.
3878.2,3879.2, Right.
3879.2,3882.2, At least the idea of a movie actually makes sense because they've been telling us.
3882.2,3884.2, They have lore all along.
3884.2,3889.2," And then the other quest does have lore, but like when I've got some ever quest fans are going to spam."
3889.2,3891.2, He's been on the cover of every box.
3891.2,3893.2," Oh, I guess it would star her."
3893.2,3894.2, Yeah.
3894.2,3895.2, So apathetic.
3895.2,3901.2, So let's have the ever quest number one fan can kid over come to apathy to write us and tell us that they think they're excited for this.
3901.2,3903.2, I bet you it's going to happen.
3903.2,3904.2, I bet you will not.
3904.2,3905.2, And we will read that out loud.
3905.2,3907.2, Someone will do it as a joke now to prove you right.
3907.2,3910.2, Because they won't be one of your banana writers.
3911.2,3913.2, Let's talk about it's been a loss.
3913.2,3917.2," We've made like off of non gaming recommendations, but we brought up American movie."
3917.2,3920.2, We need to we need to tell our listeners that if you haven't.
3920.2,3922.2, The wise ones among you have already seen it.
3922.2,3924.2, Haven't your collection.
3924.2,3925.2, But it's a fantastic.
3925.2,3926.2, It's an American movie.
3926.2,3927.2, Yes.
3927.2,3928.2, I love it.
3928.2,3929.2, And also watch it.
3929.2,3935.2, And then watch it again with the commentary because it has one of the most bizarre because it's them commenting on their own movie.
3935.2,3936.2, I have to see.
3936.2,3937.2, I haven't seen that.
3937.2,3939.2, Just so surreal and awesome.
3939.2,3942.2, And doesn't the DVD have coven on it as a coven.
3942.2,3943.2, So the quick filler.
3943.2,3945.2, It's entirety quick synopsis.
3945.2,3955.2, It's a documentary about basically a guy in his friend who decided that they want to be big Hollywood types and produce some horror movie.
3955.2,3957.2, But he has.
3957.2,3959.2," Well, it's mainly one guy."
3959.2,3961.2, And his friends just kind of like his doughto side kick.
3961.2,3963.2, He's like the best friend you could ever have.
3963.2,3964.2, I mean he's just totally.
3964.2,3968.2," He's the nicest dude, but he's also the most brain dead drug."
3968.2,3970.2, He's like a funny rubble.
3970.2,3971.2, Yeah.
3971.2,3972.2, American movie.
3972.2,3976.2, And so the thing is that his artistic drive is very real.
3976.2,3977.2, And this is why it's so.
3977.2,3981.2, And everyone who's ever aspire to do anything and feel good about it.
3981.2,3984.2, Can relate because it's like you always doubt yourself.
3984.2,3985.2, You have the second guess.
3985.2,3988.2, And what if what if I'm am I the guy am I making the.
3988.2,3993.2, The equivalent of the the coven no matter what and it's coven because he doesn't want.
3993.2,3994.2, It's coven right.
3994.2,3996.2, It's coven right with oven and he doesn't like that.
3996.2,3997.2, So it's coven.
3997.2,4002.2, And it's just painful to see because it's like he's always like right on the
4002.2,4006.2, Cusp of realizing that yet he really does suck.
4006.2,4009.2, The other complication is that of course when you work at film you're working.
4009.2,4014.2, It's not like writing a book or a screenplay or something on your own.
4014.2,4017.2, But he he needs all these other people perform.
4017.2,4022.2, The best he can get is like some local douchebag from like the Shakespeare and the park or something
4023.2,4028.2, who over acts everything to this ridiculous extent and then the rest it's like his family is mom and stuff.
4028.2,4034.2, And they're supposed to be dressed up like even witches in their stand there looking all gloom like someone stole their Halloween candy.
4034.2,4039.2, You know what's the thing that though guy yells we were always we're signing that around the office.
4039.2,4041.2, It's okay.
4041.2,4044.2, Something to him for.
4044.2,4046.2, He's a storm.
4046.2,4047.2, That's right.
4047.2,4048.2, Thank you.
4048.2,4049.2, Yeah.
4049.2,4050.2, I'm done doing this.
4051.2,4055.2, Yeah. And that guy is I mean like yeah it's just this what we're talking about.
4055.2,4059.2, The characters is grandfather right or is it like it's a great uncle.
4059.2,4060.2, Yeah.
4060.2,4065.2, And he's kind of provides the funding for this guy's crazy.
4065.2,4069.2," You know, hair brands came to make movies and he also plays a role in the movie."
4069.2,4070.2, Yeah.
4070.2,4071.2, But he's just so cynical.
4071.2,4072.2, It's just a guy.
4072.2,4076.2, You're like the thing you not of a server want to be when you get to the point where you're like two
4076.2,4080.2, two apathetic to kill yourself but you see any reason to live whatsoever.
4080.2,4086.2," You know, and then you're a year whatever your nephew puts the lines in your mouth about how you've got something to live for."
4086.2,4088.2, And the guy so clearly has nothing to live with.
4088.2,4091.2," You know, I mean it's the it's kind of like the real life Edward."
4091.2,4092.2, Yeah.
4092.2,4093.2, That's right.
4093.2,4095.2, Because I kind of like I love that movie to the Burton one where.
4095.2,4096.2, Yeah.
4096.2,4101.2, You just got like this guy who's so cheerful about his terrible crap.
4101.2,4102.2, Right.
4102.2,4104.2, And like these just like cast a really quirky weirdos.
4104.2,4105.2, Yeah.
4105.2,4106.2, Yeah.
4106.2,4107.2, Yeah.
4107.2,4108.2, Yeah.
4108.2,4109.2, Yeah.
4109.2,4110.2, Yeah.
4110.2,4112.2, It's like a real life Edward.
4112.2,4113.2, These are really highly worth it.
4113.2,4117.2, I think you got like halfway through it before he realized it was not a joke.
4117.2,4118.2, Yeah.
4118.2,4119.2," And then he was like, Oh, God."
4119.2,4120.2, This is incredible.
4120.2,4121.2, Yeah.
4121.2,4122.2, But at first he was like skeptical.
4122.2,4125.2," You know, he's like, I have no idea what it would be like to see that."
4125.2,4128.2," I mean, I've never had conversations where we knew was a documentary."
4128.2,4130.2," But afterwards, we're just like, that's not real."
4130.2,4131.2, Is it that can't be real?
4131.2,4132.2, Yes.
4132.2,4133.2, This cannot be a real situation.
4134.2,4136.2, But there's a last you couldn't make out there.
4136.2,4138.2, There's a classic moments that we haven't spoiled.
4138.2,4141.2, And we haven't even touched on the whole thing and it's full of them.
4141.2,4145.2," And also, I want to recommend if you guys haven't seen it, I'll bring in the DVD for you."
4145.2,4146.2, It's called Home Movie.
4146.2,4151.2," And then the next documentary that Chris, whatever, directed that one."
4151.2,4152.2, It gets made.
4152.2,4153.2, It's awesome.
4153.2,4154.2, Yeah.
4154.2,4156.2, It's this time.
4156.2,4157.2, It's about it.
4157.2,4162.2, It's about four people or four groups of people who live in extremely unorthodox houses.
4162.2,4169.2," So it might be some, you know, neo hippies living in what used to be an Atlas missile silo,"
4169.2,4174.2," Kansas, you know, where they would basically put into conduct rolled over three from,"
4174.2,4181.2, to a crazy and like totally lovable guy who lives in the house where he's just like a tanker.
4181.2,4185.2, And it's like everything is robotic and computer-controlled.
4185.2,4188.2," He can dial, but very, you know, kitschy, like 60 style."
4188.2,4191.2, Like he's got this piece of shit robot that he made called A Rock.
4191.2,4197.2," And it's like he's convinced that, you know, when you die, you can come back and live in A Rock."
4197.2,4201.2, And Michael Jackson heard about it and made an inquiry about buying it from him.
4201.2,4207.2, And there's people like Kat Freaks that live in a house with that's basically dedicated to their 20 something.
4207.2,4215.2," Kat's a really cool guy who lives in a house, boat in Louisiana, and who raises alligators for basically for living."
4215.2,4218.2," But yeah, you're sitting there rolling your eyes Jeff."
4218.2,4219.2," Oh, no, I'm not."
4219.2,4220.2, This is a good show.
4220.2,4221.2, It's a good show.
4221.2,4222.2, All right.
4222.2,4224.2, It's considered on my team.
4224.2,4225.2," Yeah, that's no."
4225.2,4228.2," Yeah, if you're listening, you could come back and give me your hate mail."
4228.2,4231.2," If either of these disappoint you, I know they're not."
4231.2,4233.2, GFW recommends.
4233.2,4234.2, And that's what I like to do.
4234.2,4236.2, I'll throw out a fast cheap and not a control of what they're to.
4236.2,4237.2, You ever see that?
4237.2,4238.2," Oh, no."
4238.2,4239.2," Oh, Eric Morris."
4239.2,4241.2, So this is the thin blue line guy.
4241.2,4242.2, Right.
4242.2,4243.2," Yeah, that's awesome."
4243.2,4244.2, Another one of those.
4244.2,4245.2, Two D.T.
4245.2,4246.2, I didn't see that one.
4246.2,4247.2, I did.
4247.2,4248.2, I just looked up.
4248.2,4251.2, That one's like another one of those four disparate characters.
4251.2,4253.2, He's like kind of detailing the lives of them.
4253.2,4258.2," And they're so different, but like the way he edits it, they're like, they flow into each other."
4258.2,4259.2, It's just awesome.
4259.2,4262.2, There's like a guy who studies like blind mole rats.
4262.2,4265.2, Another guy who's like a lion tamer and then another guy.
4265.2,4266.2, This is my thin guy.
4266.2,4267.2," No, this is Earl Morris."
4267.2,4268.2," Okay, Earl Morris."
4268.2,4270.2," And then another guy was like, I."
4270.2,4271.2," Oh, and what's wrong with him?"
4271.2,4272.2, He needs to get this.
4272.2,4273.2, I know you should see it.
4273.2,4274.2," Okay, now I know what you're talking about."
4274.2,4275.2, Yeah.
4275.2,4276.2, And while was the other guy?
4276.2,4277.2, He does what?
4277.2,4278.2, What's this?
4278.2,4279.2," Fourth guy, the fourth guy."
4279.2,4280.2, There's the lion tamer.
4280.2,4282.2," Oh, he makes a little little robots."
4282.2,4283.2, Robot maker.
4283.2,4284.2, Okay.
4284.2,4286.2, So crum is also good.
4286.2,4288.2," The thing that like a problem is,"
4288.2,4293.2, The common feature with all those is that the documentarians.
4293.2,4296.2," I mean, they have, they're working with eccentric subject matter."
4296.2,4299.2," The people are entertaining, you know, in their own right."
4299.2,4303.2," It's very, you know, sympathetically put together."
4303.2,4306.2," But in a way that it's not afraid to show these people's faults and, you know, their"
4306.2,4310.2," idiot, synchroces and all this, but at the end of the day, you look at him and it's"
4310.2,4312.2," It's very touching, you know, like, right."
4312.2,4314.2," You know, they're not like, he's letting him look at this."
4314.2,4315.2, Right.
4315.2,4320.2," Well, I think we're responding to all these kind of documentaries here because in some ways, we're in"
4320.2,4325.2," our own kind of, you can do these things on so many people, you know, right."
4325.2,4326.2, The trekkies is another classic.
4326.2,4327.2, The first trekkies.
4327.2,4330.2, It's another mussey.
4330.2,4333.2, It's all like documents.
4333.2,4334.2," Well, these are right."
4334.2,4336.2," Does there all awesome, awesome documents?"
4336.2,4341.2," Yeah, crommets, crommets, particularly great if you have any interest in comics and all."
4341.2,4342.2, In music too.
4342.2,4345.2," And music, especially your true."
4345.2,4349.2," It was weird because I saw that, but almost right before I moved out here."
4349.2,4353.2," So then like watching it again, after I had seen it, it was like, after the area."
4353.2,4354.2, Yeah.
4354.2,4356.2," And they're just like the character of the area is just like, you can see his breath."
4356.2,4358.2, You can see his breath are still around here.
4358.2,4359.2, It's different.
4359.2,4360.2, It's different.
4360.2,4361.2, Yeah.
4361.2,4363.2, He's not far from the soft it's actually.
4363.2,4365.2, What a kind of medication he's on nowadays.
4365.2,4368.2, And I'd like to walk by and just give him a copy of GFW.
4368.2,4369.2, Yeah.
4369.2,4370.2, Tell him to show my kisser.
4370.2,4371.2," Yo, yo."
4371.2,4372.2, Yeah.
4372.2,4375.2," We, when are we going to tape another promo?"
4375.2,4376.2, It's going to back now.
4376.2,4378.2, It's going to get so sick of hearing that shit.
4378.2,4379.2, The GFW rap.
4379.2,4381.2, Are they still playing that thing?
4381.2,4382.2, Probably that's all we got.
4382.2,4383.2," You have to, yo, yo."
4383.2,4384.2," Because for a while, we're good."
4384.2,4386.2, It'd be like every week we get a new one going.
4386.2,4387.2, Let's do it after this.
4387.2,4388.2, Let's do it.
4388.2,4389.2, Let's do it.
4389.2,4390.2, But I want.
4390.2,4391.2, I want it.
4391.2,4394.2," When we get on the time, I want to see if we get, we do like,"
4394.2,4397.2," Oh, I want to read makes of the GFW rap with Jeff."
4397.2,4398.2," Oh, get like, zoomed in."
4398.2,4400.2, Granny does do some of this magic on it.
4400.2,4403.2," So, the granny, let's get like Kanye or somebody out here to produce for us."
4403.2,4404.2, We could do that.
4404.2,4405.2, I want to go big time now.
4405.2,4406.2, No.
4406.2,4407.2, Okay.
4407.2,4410.2, Now that I'm the great middle-alayed white rap star.
4410.2,4411.2, It's popular shit.
4411.2,4413.2, It's very popular.
4413.2,4416.2, I'm happy to see that thing stuck at brought up in threads.
4416.2,4418.2, The rap.
4418.2,4419.2, Yeah.
4419.2,4422.2, People get mad about the line about walking in the sound of us walking on your
4422.2,4423.2, Moms ass though.
4423.2,4424.2, They don't like that.
4424.2,4427.2, It's not funny like long cats.
4427.2,4430.2," Well, what is your relationship with that actually?"
4430.2,4434.2," Actually, it's more played out than long cats at this point."
4434.2,4435.2, You need to make some new shit.
4435.2,4437.2, Let's just do it.
4437.2,4438.2, That new outdated shit.
4438.2,4442.2, Long cats had about to actually long cats was funny up until the day someone called
4442.2,4443.2, it long cats.
4443.2,4445.2, Those early versions of the long cats were.
4445.2,4447.2, Until they turned it into a cover.
4447.2,4448.2, They became her cats.
4448.2,4449.2, H-U-R-R.
4449.2,4452.2, Her cats laid out.
4452.2,4453.2," After we're done, yeah."
4453.2,4456.2, Let's try recording something and see what happens.
4456.2,4457.2," And if you hear it, it worked."
4457.2,4458.2, And if you don't.
4458.2,4459.2, Didn't work.
4459.2,4462.2, Then that means we had no comedy for you.
4462.2,4463.2, Yeah.
4463.2,4464.2, Are they Jeff?
4464.2,4465.2, You got laid out there.
4465.2,4467.2, We have anything else on our list here?
4467.2,4468.2, I don't know.
4468.2,4469.2, We can document everything.
4469.2,4470.2," You know, Ryan."
4470.2,4472.2, We had the...
4472.2,4473.2, Yep.
4473.2,4475.2, Just the developments with Bungie and their real estate.
4475.2,4476.2," Oh, you saw we..."
4476.2,4477.2," You know, it's almost time."
4477.2,4479.2, I want to get home and go play some team for it.
4479.2,4480.2, Yeah.
4480.2,4485.2, I only take on that really was just if Bungie is really free from Microsoft and Halo that
4485.2,4487.2, maybe they'll get back to their roots.
4487.2,4488.2, To their roots.
4488.2,4490.2, And make some mac games.
4490.2,4492.2, You guys are going to say PC gates.
4492.2,4493.2," No, they're the roots."
4493.2,4494.2, They're the roots.
4494.2,4495.2, From their mac.
4495.2,4496.2, The roots is mac.
4496.2,4497.2, Yes it is.
4497.2,4498.2, Is that right?
4498.2,4499.2, I'd like to see Marathon for the mac.
4499.2,4501.2, That's what I'm voting that Bungie's next game is.
4501.2,4503.2," And if not, then it's not free."
4503.2,4507.2," Like the end of Halo 3, the true end of Halo 3."
4507.2,4509.2, Plug your ears if you don't want spoilers.
4509.2,4513.2, I'm running the last mission set up in such a way that it...
4513.2,4514.2, Ah!
4514.2,4516.2, Maybe they go into Marathon.
4516.2,4517.2, Really?
4517.2,4518.2, It's gonna clip.
4518.2,4519.2, Hang on.
4519.2,4520.2, I don't spoil.
4520.2,4521.2, Don't spoil.
4521.2,4522.2, They go to another world.
4522.2,4524.2, I don't spoil that.
4524.2,4525.2, I've never...
4525.2,4526.2, I've never...
4526.2,4528.2, I've never...
4528.2,4529.2, Going to a wager.
4529.2,4530.2, But even the spoiler warning...
4530.2,4533.2, Why haven't I been going to have to add some echo
4533.2,4538.2, to that in the spoiler spoiler.
4538.2,4539.2, You know it's...
4539.2,4541.2," I don't know if we might not intend to bring it up or not,"
4541.2,4542.2, and I know you...
4542.2,4543.2," We all want to get home, but we have been getting some shit"
4544.2,4549.2," on at least a couple forms about saying a,"
4549.2,4551.2, heroic is hard.
4551.2,4552.2, Oh yeah.
4552.2,4555.2, The whole point of that was great.
4555.2,4557.04," the first one we got in your response was like,"
4557.04,4559.76," cause we're bussy, you're not on a full of dicks."
4559.76,4561.76," Cause you know, they, that was basically what he was saying."
4561.76,4563.12," All right, that's why I said, you know,"
4563.12,4565.76, you didn't even mark McDonald's stop me today to ask me.
4565.76,4568.24," Why are you, why are you trolling Halo?"
4568.24,4569.4," The trolling at my ass, what?"
4569.4,4572.08," I can't, I mean, you know, we play something we want to talk about it."
4572.08,4575.36, And I know as you go around trumpeting this mode.
4575.36,4578.8," And I honestly, you know, I say,"
4578.8,4580.2," I say, I'm serious flaws with this mode."
4580.2,4582.96," Yeah, it's not, it's not enjoying it so much."
4582.96,4586.76," And at the same time, I've had so many people like PM me who sent me,"
4586.76,4588.16," you know, messages and stuff saying like,"
4588.16,4590.8," hey, thank God, like I felt like I was alone."
4590.8,4591.28, Uh-huh.
4591.28,4593.12," And it was like all these people that like,"
4593.12,4595.44," they don't want to say anything because they just know people are saying,"
4595.44,4596.72," because you can't, you suck."
4596.72,4598.4," Hey, change plane it on easy."
4598.4,4600.0," And then the confusion when it wasn't that,"
4600.0,4601.44, I couldn't beat it.
4601.44,4603.36," But it was that I just said, I was like,"
4603.36,4604.88," you know what, this isn't fun."
4604.88,4605.44, Right.
4605.44,4606.24, I don't need to do that.
4606.24,4607.28, That's just because he suck.
4607.28,4608.08, I beat it.
4608.08,4610.24, Which is the response.
4610.24,4612.32," And then they had someone say, oh, but because he doesn't know anything"
4612.32,4615.36," about console FPS, which was fucking hilarious to me."
4615.36,4618.0," You know, if only you knew how many,"
4618.0,4620.96," it's really to the point with the exception of Killzone,"
4620.96,4624.4, I've played every single console FPS in existence.
4624.4,4625.2, That doesn't make you good.
4625.2,4628.639999999999," To the saddest, no, to the saddest extent from like right down like"
4628.639999999999,4631.5199999999995," fugitive hunter and Robo Cop for Xbox,"
4631.5199999999995,4633.28, I don't even like your sand here.
4633.28,4636.32," You should have honours the game where like it ended when you,"
4636.32,4638.32, when you catch some of it in Laudon.
4638.32,4639.12, Really?
4639.12,4640.88, Really come in the shit until he's right.
4640.96,4643.12, Is that the one that had that awesome rap?
4643.12,4645.52," Some of it, Laudon, where you been hiding,"
4645.52,4646.56, you come in for me?
4646.56,4647.76," Well, I'm coming for you."
4647.76,4650.72," No, if you're asking on the PS2, yeah, that was it."
4650.72,4654.4800000000005," You could, uh, some music video, that was play."
4654.4800000000005,4656.4800000000005," He was he rhymed, Laudon with hiding."
4656.4800000000005,4657.4400000000005, Hasn't I?
4657.4400000000005,4660.0," Some of it, Laudon, where you been hiding?"
4660.0,4661.68," And the shit, if he can use an accent like that,"
4661.68,4662.32, you can make it.
4662.32,4663.84," You could, yeah, you could cheat him."
4663.84,4666.72, You could unlock the video of that dude in the studio.
4666.72,4667.92, I forget his name.
4667.92,4669.92, That was some hot shit.
4670.0,4671.36," But so of course, then you could say, well,"
4671.36,4674.64," that's a piece of shit, FPS, and that doesn't mean you know anything"
4674.64,4677.28," about killing a lot of FPSs, this is shit once, but no, I'd ever."
4677.28,4679.2, I've played all the Halo games I played.
4679.2,4682.32," I mean, you name it like a play to say that was a play to say."
4682.32,4685.52," But I should have just, my response should always be,"
4685.52,4686.32, I'm a pussy.
4686.32,4688.72," Well, that's what my, that's the only response."
4688.72,4690.0," All right, that is the only response."
4690.0,4691.4400000000005," Yeah, yeah."
4691.4400000000005,4694.16," Uh, but I guess we're all done with that game."
4694.16,4695.52, Mm-hmm.
4695.52,4696.4800000000005," We all done, period."
4696.4800000000005,4698.88," It's like this again, more analogies before."
4698.88,4701.68, I gave you the one about like extreme bonnet dude.
4701.68,4704.88," Next one that seems appropriate for me is, you know, when you go swimming"
4704.88,4708.16, at a lair or a river or something with your friends and you find some cliff
4708.16,4711.36," and you're all up there and you're like, you jumped the first time,"
4711.36,4714.08, then you dive and then you do a flip and it's never enough.
4714.08,4715.68, There's always that one piece of shit up there.
4715.68,4717.28," Like, come on, do a trip of me."
4717.28,4720.8, And then you all stand there for an hour waiting for him to think he's going to do one.
4720.8,4723.76," And then he doesn't, or if he does do it, it's just so he like,"
4723.76,4725.28," you know, hits his head or something."
4726.24,4728.48," Like, do watch at the fuck off."
4728.48,4730.5599999999995," I don't even know what, what how does this relate?"
4730.5599999999995,4733.5199999999995," Because then the same like, you know, you play, I play a normal."
4733.5199999999995,4734.96," We got a plan on her own, man."
4734.96,4735.92, Go for her own.
4735.92,4736.96, I played her own.
4736.96,4738.32," You got to do legendary, man."
4738.32,4739.5199999999995, I played legendary.
4739.5199999999995,4741.2," You got to do legendary with skulls, man."
4741.2,4743.44," So it's like, it never ends, you know?"
4743.44,4746.639999999999," By the time you're doing the fucking Greg Lagena song of the Rocks on your head,"
4747.2,4749.44," you're so dumb from the experience in the first place,"
4749.44,4750.48," from, you know, hitting your head."
4750.48,4751.28, Yeah.
4751.28,4752.0, I don't know.
4752.0,4754.32, That kind of time to do these things over and over either.
4754.4,4756.719999999999, Yeah. I finally finished by a shot this weekend.
4756.719999999999,4758.24, And I'm not gonna cry at a second.
4758.24,4759.44, And now I'm slow.
4759.44,4761.04, But I feel done now.
4761.04,4762.639999999999, People are already turning on by a shot.
4762.639999999999,4764.32, I noticed that now is gonna bring that up.
4764.32,4765.5199999999995, That by a shot back on.
4765.5199999999995,4766.639999999999, And they did the dumbest thing.
4766.639999999999,4768.48," The people that are doing that are like, actually."
4768.48,4768.799999999999, Yeah.
4768.799999999999,4772.799999999999," All the dude, I mean, because they tried to like recast the terms of the discussion into,"
4772.799999999999,4774.719999999999," well, all there is about by a shot is this"
4774.719999999999,4777.759999999999," alleged, you know, binary moral choice of whether or not you, you,"
4777.759999999999,4778.639999999999, you harvest or not.
4778.639999999999,4782.799999999999," And it's like, well, did you forget about the part where it's so much fun"
4782.8,4787.4400000000005, to use all the plasmids and the weapons and to hack if you're so inclined and all this stuff.
4787.84,4790.320000000001," And hey, you know, this will be the next argument."
4790.320000000001,4794.4800000000005," Oh my god, is he saying the combat and bio-shocks better than Halo and Legendary?"
4796.320000000001,4800.96," It's like, hey, to me, honestly it is because I would rather hack a drone,"
4800.96,4804.0," have that with me going, freeze this dude,"
4804.0,4806.24, and then electrocute this guy and shoot him and stuff.
4806.24,4808.72," And I mean, hey, it is, it is fun to me."
4808.72,4809.92," I have to, because you're up that shit."
4809.92,4810.56, It's fun.
4810.64,4813.120000000001," And if it's because I'm a pussy, then so be it."
4813.76,4818.080000000001," But um, nobody ultimately reminds me more of like the experience, you know,"
4818.080000000001,4821.280000000001," when I'm playing online or something, which is so weird about because Halo"
4822.320000000001,4827.200000000001," on those difficulty levels is the exact opposite of Halo Online, with really good players,"
4827.200000000001,4828.56, are constantly moving.
4828.56,4833.4400000000005," So you know, rapidly changing, you know, melee grenade, this and that vehicle,"
4833.4400000000005,4839.52," all that and then you take it and you turn it to that very slow, you know, crawl through the things."
4839.84,4841.76," But yeah, people were turning on bio-shocks right."
4841.76,4843.360000000001," Yeah, they're turning on bio-shock, I have no to set."
4844.080000000001,4845.6," You say, Halo, you saw your own car."
4845.6,4846.56," Oh, I'm not turning on it."
4846.56,4849.76, I think it was one of the best games of the year and it's still going to be one of the end.
4849.76,4850.72, At the end of the year.
4850.72,4854.8," I would play, I would gladly play bio-shock again and I never want to play Halo campaign again."
4855.200000000001,4857.360000000001," And I'm not just saying that, they're really, yeah, I'm totally the way."
4857.360000000001,4861.200000000001," I honestly, hey, I wish it made me that happy, it would be something else to like."
4861.200000000001,4865.6," You know, like what's someone, you know, is really into some comic book or a TV show."
4865.6,4867.84," And at the end of the day, if you watch it and you don't get it,"
4867.92,4872.88," you're kind of like, well, it would be great because it's fun to find something new to really do love."
4873.4400000000005,4876.08," You know, when you're proven wrong or something, it's like the best thing in the world."
4876.08,4879.04," Like, oh, I got like two more seasons of this to catch up with."
4879.04,4879.76, This is awesome.
4879.76,4880.16, Yeah.
4880.16,4882.96," So it's like, I don't go in there wanting to hate it, but then, and I don't hate it."
4882.96,4888.400000000001," Well, it's like, it was common for what it was, but not fun enough to make me want to play it again."
4888.400000000001,4888.72, Right.
4888.72,4890.08, And that's actually a single player.
4890.08,4891.360000000001, That's a misperceptive player.
4891.360000000001,4891.76, Single player.
4891.76,4892.56, And yeah.
4892.56,4894.400000000001, That's opposed to co-op or something.
4894.400000000001,4897.04," So maybe, hey, if a group of people get together and want to play,"
4897.04,4900.16," that's another story and, you know, multiplayer, of course."
4900.16,4902.16, I had a fine time with the Halo campaign.
4902.16,4903.76," I mean, I played it on normal."
4903.76,4908.32, And I found it to be a fun game to play when I was taking breaks from other games.
4908.32,4913.2," Because he just, you know, the difficulty on normal to me was just at the right point where I could"
4913.2,4916.96, just kind of blaze through without having to think too much and just get to the next part.
4918.96,4920.72, But you'd have to really like it.
4920.72,4922.72, He wants to spend that much time with it.
4922.72,4922.88, Yeah.
4922.88,4924.88, It's not like I was playing it up as an obligation.
4924.88,4926.400000000001, And I was genuinely enjoying it.
4926.400000000001,4927.12," It just, yeah."
4927.12,4927.76, Me too.
4927.76,4932.24," So if you get a really long movie or a really, you know, dance book, it's like, it can be as long"
4932.24,4934.72, and dances that wants as long as you're really enjoying it.
4934.72,4938.400000000001," But if you're not, then you're like, no, I just get to it."
4938.400000000001,4940.88, Couldn't this just be 300 pages instead of 1000?
4940.88,4943.84," You know, and that's just my experience with, yeah."
4943.84,4945.92, I was just going to add to your point earlier.
4945.92,4949.2," I think that in general, like, we want to like stuff."
4949.2,4949.6, Right.
4949.6,4953.6," I mean, that's, you know, I mean, it would be ideal for us."
4953.6,4958.56," And I think it's a misconception that we enjoy bashing stuff or whatever that, or that"
4958.56,4961.84," when we ride a negative review, it feels like we're just like having fun with it."
4961.84,4964.88," I mean, sometimes we are because it's kind of cathartic."
4964.88,4965.360000000001, Yeah.
4965.360000000001,4967.76, Like we had to spend 40 hours playing this piece of shit.
4967.76,4969.4400000000005, I'm going to get my revenge now.
4969.4400000000005,4975.200000000001," But for the most part, I think it's, I mean, is there ever a case where it's not a"
4975.200000000001,4977.4400000000005, bummer to be reviewing a bad game?
4977.4400000000005,4980.160000000001," You know, I think we all want to like the stuff that we're playing."
4980.160000000001,4982.08," And it just adds, as far lives of better life."
4982.08,4984.48," And if you think that's a good game, that Halo is a bad,"
4984.48,4985.12, it'll through soon.
4985.12,4986.48," No, I'm not saying that."
4986.48,4988.48, I don't want it to be confused with that.
4988.48,4989.44," No, it was like I said."
4989.44,4992.64," I mean, some parts, I think, are really like genuinely fantastic."
4992.64,4995.5199999999995," See, we keep, why do we keep apologizing about Halo though?"
4995.5199999999995,4996.24, I know why.
4996.24,4998.48," Because, well, it's got to work with the effects of Michael's stuff."
4998.48,5001.28, I don't think it's a piece of shit and I don't think it sucks.
5001.28,5004.72," But what I'm saying is I don't think it's the best shit I've ever played to the point, or"
5004.72,5007.28, I don't even think it's so good that it makes me want to play it again.
5007.28,5007.92, Yep.
5007.92,5008.32, Right.
5008.32,5011.92," But that's not, there's plenty of things that's that there's plenty of games at plenty of"
5011.92,5017.2, movies and books and entertainment and all formats where I like it and I enjoy doing it.
5017.2,5018.32, I just don't want to do it again.
5018.32,5019.84, I don't want to buy like the VHS.
5019.84,5022.72, I'm going watch it every night that week of certain movies.
5022.72,5025.84," You know, I'm not sure if I'll play by a shock again."
5025.84,5026.96, I may or may not.
5026.96,5028.32, I thought it was awesome.
5028.32,5028.72, No.
5028.72,5030.72," Yeah, it'll be fun to wait a while, I think."
5032.08,5036.8," But again, I wanted to say too that I am, I would admit, I'm very skeptical going into anything"
5036.8,5038.4, that's been massively hyped.
5038.48,5045.12," But I have so many instances in my experience where like the, the, the, the, whatever it is,"
5045.12,5047.92," the game, the movie, the comic is so, it is so good."
5047.92,5049.36, It completely blows out away.
5049.36,5054.32," Like preacher the book is one of my favorite comic series and like God, I was so determined"
5054.32,5055.36, to hate on that thing.
5055.36,5056.36, Right.
5056.36,5057.759999999999, I heard so much about it and I'm sure.
5057.759999999999,5060.32," Okay, you know, at least Philistines recommend it."
5060.32,5061.36, It's going to suck.
5061.36,5065.839999999999," And then I went and I was skeptical the first book and then like by the end of the second one,"
5065.92,5068.96, it's like went back to the store and bought like every one of them.
5068.96,5072.400000000001," Every one of the collections and then it was like, okay, this is definitely one of my favorite"
5072.400000000001,5074.08," graphic, collect, craft no collection."
5074.08,5076.56," Yeah, quite often you can't one can believe the hype."
5076.56,5078.96," Yeah, I mean, and that goes for so many things, you know,"
5078.96,5080.88, I'm gonna cut my current one is heroes.
5080.88,5081.68, You all know I thought.
5081.68,5082.16, Right.
5082.16,5082.4800000000005, Right.
5082.4800000000005,5083.92," I, you've started off heroes."
5083.92,5086.08, I know that we all know that you would love it.
5086.08,5087.4400000000005, It's like totally your thing.
5087.4400000000005,5090.0," Yeah, as soon as I start watching it, I'm sure it'll be great."
5090.0,5091.52, But it's like me and world of warcraft.
5091.52,5093.2, Do you guys have the deepest right to that?
5093.2,5093.92, Of heroes?
5093.92,5094.16, Yeah.
5094.16,5095.28, So I can catch up and
5095.44,5096.0, I don't.
5097.04,5097.84, I don't know.
5097.84,5099.92, I don't have to get into the Ken Burns thing too.
5099.92,5101.599999999999, They want 180 books for that.
5101.599999999999,5102.24, Yeah.
5102.24,5103.12, Whoa.
5103.12,5103.599999999999, Yeah.
5103.599999999999,5104.32, It's like shit.
5104.32,5105.599999999999," They're, and it's so exciting."
5105.599999999999,5108.8, I'm going to the PBS site and it's like the testimonials.
5108.8,5115.44, It's like I'm so glad that my children can get a piece of history for the low price of 179.99.
5116.88,5118.08," Dude, what?"
5118.08,5118.719999999999, What's in there?
5118.719999999999,5119.679999999999, That is that much money.
5119.679999999999,5120.719999999999, That's a lot of money.
5120.719999999999,5121.5199999999995, I'm sure.
5121.5199999999995,5121.84, Say that.
5122.96,5123.5199999999995, Yeah.
5123.5199999999995,5125.12, I don't know.
5125.92,5127.5199999999995, An actual soldier comes here.
5127.5199999999995,5130.64, I was a protect the 80 year old guy and tells you stories.
5132.48,5133.84," Hey, god shit out."
5133.84,5134.48, I'm good.
5134.48,5134.88, Yeah.
5134.88,5136.16, It's going to be a bad shot.
5136.16,5136.72, I'm glad.
5136.72,5138.08, That's a pan over these pictures.
5142.08,5142.48, Yeah.
5142.48,5143.5199999999995, So they'll give me that.
5143.5199999999995,5148.08, I felt that I plugged out the war that very first episode when we
5148.08,5150.72," uh, we casted a couple weeks ago because I had lots of first one."
5150.72,5152.08, And I really enjoyed it.
5152.08,5154.96, So I wanted to make sure everybody who was sent here got a little
5155.04,5156.0, edgification.
5156.0,5158.16, And then I never watched another episode of that.
5158.16,5159.6, I want to see what I think I've seen.
5159.6,5160.8, I've heard some complaints.
5160.8,5163.2, No one to see how they stuck in the box.
5163.2,5165.2, I couldn't watch it because I had the ugly beddy season premiered.
5165.2,5166.0," Oh, yes."
5167.76,5168.8, That's pretty sad.
5169.84,5170.4, Just say that.
5171.2,5172.4, Why did we just let that go?
5172.4,5173.44, What did I say that at that?
5173.44,5176.32, You didn't watch the work because you had to see a season premier of ugly
5176.32,5176.96, fucking beddy.
5177.68,5179.68," Hey, ugly beddy is great."
5179.68,5181.52, And America forever wanted any for her.
5181.52,5183.68, I can't see this kind of comic performance.
5184.64,5185.04, Uh-huh.
5185.04,5185.84, You want me to know what?
5185.84,5187.04," You know what, Sean?"
5187.04,5187.84," You know what, Sean?"
5187.84,5188.240000000001," You know what, Sean?"
5188.240000000001,5188.88," You know what, Sean?"
5188.88,5191.04, I'm only a Sean inside.
5191.04,5192.0, She's not ugly.
5192.0,5195.52, I know how many times did you get so good?
5195.52,5198.16, I got so sick of reading like entertainment weekly or something.
5198.16,5199.76," Like one of the hottest shows,"
