0.0,8.44, Hello and welcome to the first and probably last ever computer gaming world.
8.44,10.64, That's optimism for you right there folks.
10.64,12.68, Getting off to a confidence start.
12.68,15.0, The first ever computer gaming world podcast.
15.0,19.72," I'm Jeff Green, the editor and chief of computer gaming world magazine and I'm going to"
19.72,23.6, let today's panelists introduce themselves starting with you sir.
23.6,26.0," I feel like I'm on a game show now, but panelists today."
26.0,26.68, Right.
26.68,27.68, You could win.
28.16,31.36, So this is garnetly and I'm the managing editor up at oneup.com.
31.36,32.84, I'm Darren Gladstone.
32.84,33.84, I'm an alcoholic.
33.84,36.84, Have you seen your editor over at computer gaming world?
36.84,40.08," I'm Sean Elliott, previous editor at computer gaming world."
40.08,44.96," Now because we haven't done this before, the thing about podcast, those of us who have"
44.96,47.72," now, Jeff, you have totally been on many podcasts."
47.72,51.4," Well, that's what I'm saying and the thing that I've learned now is that they get better"
51.4,52.64, over time.
52.64,53.8, So the pressure is off here.
53.8,54.8, We know this one's going to suck.
54.8,56.8," Oh, so you're going to mail this one in."
56.8,58.04," All right, we're going to mail this one in."
58.04,58.519999999999996, Awesome.
58.519999999999996,61.04, Readers need to know that or listeners need to know that.
61.04,64.47999999999999, And then from after this one will be set.
64.47999999999999,65.39999999999999, That does help our audience.
65.39999999999999,66.44, They don't have to be able to read.
66.44,67.96, Keep your expectations low people.
67.96,68.64, That's what I'm saying.
68.64,70.64, That's why I live my life.
70.64,75.92," The reason that we've all gathered here today, though, is to talk specifically about,"
75.92,78.2, now we're getting someone married.
78.2,79.44, Just stop interrupting.
79.44,81.24, The CS is already not going well.
81.24,86.24," What we want to talk about today is Peter Moore, who would"
86.24,88.52," actually be the most title, by the way."
88.52,89.36, What is his title now?
89.36,91.72, So they changed their responsibilities.
91.72,94.67999999999999," Well, he's an exec over at Microsoft."
94.67999999999999,100.56," He's a corporate vice president, actually, of Microsoft's interactive entertainment division."
100.56,105.67999999999999, He spoke at the dice conference in Las Vegas this past week.
105.67999999999999,113.56," And he made some comments about PC gaming that, well, let me just read what he said."
113.56,117.12, I highlighted a little quote for you here.
117.12,122.72," He got up in front of the audience said in Vegas and he said, quote, I want to apologize"
122.72,129.72," for the dereliction of duty to our company's number one platform, the PC, in terms of gaming."
129.72,132.84, We've been a little distracted for the past few years.
132.84,135.0," Mia Copa, we've been busy."
135.0,137.16, Did you know I got it?
137.16,140.56," I hate to throw those words out there at the beginning, but I'm so over the"
140.56,142.72, pontificating and PC gaming.
142.72,144.92000000000002," It's like, whatever dude."
144.92000000000002,145.92000000000002, It's done.
145.92000000000002,146.92000000000002, Thank you.
146.92000000000002,148.6, We need to hear this for a 50 billionth time.
148.6,150.24, Every console comes out and every time.
150.24,152.52," Again, it's like Coca-Cola advertising campaigns."
152.52,154.36," Oh, let's rock and roll another one."
154.36,156.28, It's been two years.
156.28,157.28, Does it?
157.28,158.68, Did he say anything here?
158.68,159.68, Did he?
159.68,162.4, Do we believe him this time?
162.4,163.4, Did he?
163.4,165.92000000000002," I mean, what do you think the point was of him saying?"
165.92000000000002,167.28, I'll tell you what I think the point.
167.28,170.28, The point is he basically wants us to upgrade the windows this day.
170.28,171.28, Right?
171.28,172.28, Absolutely.
172.28,174.4," Well, yeah, I want to play a, I want to play Halo 2, I want to do a computer."
174.4,175.4, Right.
175.4,179.96," Actually, to me, that was the big irony of this announcement was that it came the day after"
179.96,185.36," we found out that to play Halo 2, and now two year old, two years old at this point"
185.36,190.52," today, two year old Xbox One game, you're going to have to upgrade your operating"
190.52,192.32, system to windows this day.
192.32,197.2," Now if Microsoft is saying that they're now, they forgot about us, but now they were"
197.2,198.2, remembered.
198.2,203.32," Oh, yeah, there's you guys, and really we support you and God we love you."
203.32,206.56, Then why are they making a separate our system to play a game that's already two years
206.56,207.56, old?
207.56,209.35999999999999," You know, it's a damn shame that PC gaming got forgotten."
209.35999999999999,210.35999999999999," Half life, too."
210.35999999999999,211.35999999999999, That was horrible.
211.35999999999999,212.35999999999999, I hated that.
212.35999999999999,213.35999999999999, Battlefield.
213.35999999999999,214.35999999999999," That's the worst, isn't it?"
214.35999999999999,215.35999999999999," Man, I'm telling you."
215.35999999999999,216.35999999999999, They totally need to forget about PC gaming.
216.35999999999999,217.35999999999999," I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, we're a reddit and stepchild."
217.35999999999999,219.0," I know, we're a graphic sucks."
219.0,220.35999999999999," It's kind of like, how long is it?"
220.35999999999999,221.35999999999999, Do you know what you've been around?
221.35999999999999,223.44," Really, they're the ones who forgot PC gaming."
223.44,225.0, The rest of us didn't.
225.0,227.24, The gaming has gone on without Microsoft's help.
227.24,233.48," Well, are they suggesting that they're going to be releasing a $59.99 product in Halo"
233.48,237.24, 2 or is it going to be spearheading in different type of emulation or something where we
237.24,239.24, can play Xbox One games through Vista.
239.24,241.48, You know what I'd have reduced price and be a download.
241.48,242.88," Yeah, you know, they're never going to do that."
242.88,244.36, They're going to keep it where you have to stay.
244.36,246.48," If you want the console game, you're going to have to buy the console."
246.48,249.08," That's that would undermine their entire business model, I think."
249.08,250.08, Right.
250.08,254.96," That if they really, you know, if they, they talked about a few more talk about platform agnosticism."
254.96,258.64, And the fact that they care about the PC gamers as much as the Xbox Amers.
258.64,263.72," If they really cared, couldn't they, in theory, wouldn't there, what would prevent them"
263.72,270.6," from making a game a new game, Xbox 360, and PC compatible at the same time?"
270.6,274.48," Well, I think with the developments at XNA, that's where they're really trying to go for."
274.48,276.24, I don't know if it's going to happen right away.
276.24,277.96000000000004," I mean, it's like slowly happening."
277.96000000000004,282.92," You're seeing the fact that you can like take your 360 controller, what, the wired one, plug"
282.92,285.8, it into the PC USB port and it's going to work with any game now.
285.8,288.6," And it'll work, and it's the best gamepad I've used."
288.6,290.24, So that's cool.
290.24,291.24, Right.
291.24,292.24, So what's up with that?
292.24,293.24," I mean, how's that controller working now?"
293.24,294.96000000000004," Is the driver, it wasn't there some drive-ease issues right there?"
294.96000000000004,295.96000000000004, No.
295.96000000000004,299.24," Well, I mean, basically, you can basically go to get a Windows update now and it'll be right in"
299.24,300.24, the system.
300.24,301.24," Okay, cool."
301.24,302.64," But otherwise, it came with a disk at first."
302.64,303.64," I mean, it's kind of annoying."
303.64,305.68, It won't work the wireless controllers.
305.68,309.28000000000003," So like, even if you have the, was it the Lincoln charge kit, whatever the hell they call."
309.28000000000003,311.68," Right, which doesn't actually transfer any data just for us."
311.68,312.68, Exactly.
312.92,314.36," They need to get a wireless dog, a little bit of some sort."
314.36,316.96," But otherwise, that's one way in."
316.96,319.2," I mean, oh, so that controller really plug and play now."
319.2,320.96," I mean, it's a really plug and play."
320.96,324.72," I mean, it's going to, like, a lot of developers now are starting to build that support"
324.72,325.72, into their games.
325.72,328.08," Like, like, it in Windows update goes on and gets the driver in a way you go."
328.08,330.48," Yeah, I mean, a auto assaults, it would be a great example."
330.48,334.32," Like, you're able to play that game with your controller."
334.32,337.6," Of course, you know, while an NC software isn't talking, I mean, that leaves the door wide"
337.6,340.76, open for auto assault to come out to the 360 as well.
341.12,341.76," Oh, yeah."
341.92,343.8," There would be a no brainer, it's like, exactly."
344.88,346.84, But the controller working is one thing.
347.24,351.0," And then the game, but the games working, but that's all part of XNA."
351.0,352.8," So I mean, like, sure, it all worked together."
352.96,353.56, Right.
353.84,354.32, I don't know.
354.32,356.56," I just, it feels very hollow to me."
356.56,362.44," It seems like every, every, you know, pre-E3 Microsoft comes around to the PC gaming"
362.44,367.44," press and, you know, sort of like, it's like, Charlie Brown in the football."
367.44,368.0," You know,"
368.08,376.8," and then we go to E3 and all we ever see is, you know, there's like, you know, one mile"
376.8,381.8," long stretch of Xbox games and then somewhere in the back corner, you know, there's Zootai"
381.8,382.8, Kune 2.
382.8,385.72, So it really is like Charlie Brown in the football because then they go on to do Lucy the
385.72,388.92," psychologist, you know, and here, give me your nickel and I'll come and soul you about"
388.92,389.92, your PC game.
389.92,390.92, Right.
390.92,392.56," I remember there was like, was it a hero to a go?"
392.56,397.68," It was just like, you, you couldn't even find a PC area on the floor itself."
397.76,402.32, You had to actually go to the press booth behind the scenes to actually see the PC games
402.32,403.32, in action.
403.32,404.32, Mm-hmm.
404.32,408.52," And you know, we're, we talk in Microsoft, the platform like Microsoft, the OS developer,"
408.52,412.2, we talk in Microsoft game studios because which one is he talking about here?
412.2,413.36, That's a great question.
413.36,418.44," Actually, when you talk to the game studios, people, you know, they're all nice people."
418.44,422.24," And you can feel kind of bad for them when they come in there like, please, please believe"
422.24,425.44," that we're, you know, we take you seriously because that's what they do."
425.68,430.08," You know, you get the sense when you talk to the guys at the game studio that they wish"
430.08,435.52," that Microsoft was a little more supportive of the PC gamers, you know, I hate to take it"
435.52,440.6," out on the guys who come to our office and, you know, open their laptop and show us"
440.6,441.6, so you're taking it too.
441.6,445.64," Hey, I'd rather than show me so you're taking it too than flight simulator 10."
445.64,446.64, Come on.
446.64,450.48," I know you guys are going to like, you're rupt on me on this one, but I am so over flight"
450.48,451.48, sims.
451.48,453.48," That's like, I can write it on you."
453.48,454.48, Yeah.
455.0,456.36," It's like, I don't want to go with that one."
456.36,460.76," Put my head in the sand 10 years ago and I'm thinking, yeah, the PC game community, yeah,"
460.76,462.56, they still probably play a lot of flight sims.
462.56,466.08000000000004, I'm betting site tech who's been trying to sell joysticks might have a little argument
466.08000000000004,467.08000000000004, with them.
467.08000000000004,471.52000000000004," That's not, if I'm trotting out something to show off direct X 10 and business gaming,"
471.52000000000004,478.56, I'm not trotting out a flight sim game for a very niche audience and a two-year-old Xbox
478.56,479.56, game.
479.56,480.56, Right.
480.56,481.56, What on earth?
481.56,482.56, Exactly.
482.64,487.72, I think they were showing when they came around to show us their commitment to PC gaming.
487.72,490.88, Were things that weren't game related.
490.88,494.28000000000003," I mean, and it was like OS things like the parental controls."
494.28000000000003,495.28000000000003, Okay.
495.28000000000003,496.28000000000003," Hey, brilliant stuff."
496.28000000000003,497.28000000000003, Which is brilliant stuff.
497.28000000000003,498.28000000000003, Right.
498.28000000000003,500.28, But it's not game themselves.
500.28,504.68, For the very reasons that Donna just pointed out is why I think that really they're not
504.68,505.68, showing their hand yet.
505.68,509.68, But instead they're just tipping it slightly in preparation for E3 or something and that the
509.68,515.12, real issues are going to be functionality similar to Xbox Live on PC.
515.12,519.36," Again, I still think there could be something in the works in terms of emulation or something"
519.36,523.44, because right now I just can't imagine them seriously thinking that Halo 2 was going to
523.44,526.28, interest any PC players right now.
526.28,530.36, Because the difference between Halo 1 and the generation of technology was the gap
530.36,533.5600000000001, wasn't very large at the time between Xbox and PC gaming then.
533.56,540.64, And now between our 7800 cards and HHS crossfire stuff and Xbox 1 and then in light of
540.64,545.56, how slow bungee works I can't see them allocating their resources to upgrade Halo 2 again
545.56,546.56, in this net.
546.56,551.3199999999999, I just really think that what we are hearing at a dice is just them sort of clearing their
551.3199999999999,553.28, throat for announcements to come.
553.28,556.4," Yeah, I mean the only things that they've talked about so far for Halo and I've talked"
556.4,561.3599999999999," to those guys actually about like in the past, like setting up emulation, they've shot"
561.3599999999999,562.3599999999999, it down every time.
562.36,565.8000000000001," I mean as much as I'd like to see it to me it makes sense because you know, they're losing"
565.8000000000001,567.8000000000001, money on making hardware.
567.8000000000001,573.28, But I don't know if you want to prove to me that like PC gaming is alive and kicking whatever
573.28,576.9, bring me a real IP bring me a new IP don't bring me a bunch of retards your Microsoft
576.9,581.32, you got money go out and you know stalker it's been in trouble it's like on the ropes
581.32,585.48, go out by the whole damn game bring it over fix it make it right and then throw it out
585.48,586.6800000000001, there's a PC showcase.
586.6800000000001,588.12, This is this is what I'm saying.
588.12,592.32, I'm saying show show us your new IP show some cool games don't show us the fact that
592.32,597.5600000000001, we can keep our you know lock our kids out of game time or whatever through the OS.
597.5600000000001,602.36, I mean whatever that stuff is great but that's not proving to me that you're committed
602.36,603.84, to as a game platform.
603.84,606.84, Well I think they're committing to it and the fact they want to bring in more casual
606.84,610.7600000000001, people or people who are more comfortable with a console environment and PCs are a little
610.7600000000001,615.24, intimidating to them or they want to make the money off those that are exactly exactly
615.24,619.6800000000001, exactly I mean like all the pop cap people make it make it make it be for your OS that
619.68,623.76, requires more hardware that you can play more games on and then just streamline the interface.
623.76,630.28, Right Sean you had a good point before we went on air about about Valve and its digital
630.28,638.4, distribution and through steam that you know really the kind of PC gaming renaissance that
638.4,643.3199999999999, Peter Moore is saying we're going to have maybe it's already begun because of actions
643.3199999999999,644.3199999999999, like that.
644.3199999999999,647.56, Right I think if for one it's conceded as we already discussed to say that you're you know
647.56,651.8, about to Harold a PC gaming renaissance when people like Valve you know groups like Valve
651.8,655.92, himself are already blazing that trail and saying instead where you like parental controls
655.92,657.52, and stuff not so interesting.
657.52,662.0799999999999, Episode content now in light of a BF2 patch just came out and I spent the the whole day
662.0799999999999,663.68, trying to find a place to get it.
663.68,668.0799999999999, Irony is I should have a fast past a file for a five plan or something like that.
668.0799999999999,672.64, Is anyone less so we do an old the difference already between between now and a year
672.64,676.88, ago when you looked at steam the way that I looked at steam now it's like this is ridiculous
676.96,680.32, why do I have to go find patches for my games and all this and it really showed me is like
680.32,684.72, okay the renaissance is already like happened you know and it's already been going on
684.72,688.4, and so I thought about that and I was also talking about you know what if in fact they
688.4,692.72, really are trying to do something similar to Xbox live on PC and implement that I mean
692.72,695.6, and how will that work because I mean obviously you're not going to bring some like steam
695.6,699.4, on they're trying to work on their own thing right now if that their friends list has been
699.4,703.12, if you miss Lee broken for a long time but they've been building something much more
703.12,706.2, ambitious out of it than hey you can find your friend and play
706.5200000000001,710.48, so but if you guys are anything different every time I've talked to Microsoft the
711.2,715.6800000000001, unofficial off the record stuff is that look they're not going to do anything live like on PC
715.9200000000001,720.0400000000001, because that's a console IP and they don't want then there's some internal
720.88,723.12, disagreements there that they don't want to step on each other's toes
723.36,726.9200000000001, the pretty much what you've heard yeah is and that's such a shame yeah
726.9200000000001,731.6800000000001, it's you got to get past that then they should be there they should absolutely be bringing together the PC
731.6800000000001,735.8000000000001, gamers on the console gamers in the same like helping bring my gamer tag over and they're doing it already
735.8,739.76, like for a whole series make the live brand that much stronger hey look
739.76,743.7199999999999, we're talking to speculation on ps3 look they're going to have an online service
743.7199999999999,746.0799999999999, there's going to be something I mean it's obviously not going to be called hub because it's
746.0799999999999,750.5999999999999, a stupidest name ever but but they're going to have something so strengthen your
750.5999999999999,753.4, live brand you're already out there you're number one you topped all the
753.4,759.28, trying to connect your 360 to your PC as it is I mean exactly so why not why not
759.28,763.4, go all the way right right I mean I don't have to ask it like you know the
763.4,770.4, Xbox 360 games be playable in your PC let you connect to Xbox live over your PC
770.4,774.12, here my list back and forth but do you think as far as playing the console games on your
774.12,777.3199999999999, PC I think I might be like security issue because I mean like once you start doing that
777.3199999999999,779.84, you know imagine the wear sights just load up with uh...
779.84,783.04, yeah I don't know if you can really need to have the console games playable in
783.04,787.4, okay but have a live like interface such that when I want to play a Microsoft or
787.4,791.56, or even sell it out to everybody else if I want to play a game on my vista PC I can have
791.64,796.3199999999999, this live connectivity and wouldn't that only help Microsoft and Xbox live sure
796.3199999999999,801.4, if all of us who live in a PC gaming bubble who only read about Xbox live
801.4,805.7199999999999, suddenly we're experiencing it ourselves on our PCs maybe that would open us up to
805.7199999999999,809.64, wanting to get a 360 or even more so the ones that don't live in a bubble like myself
809.64,814.68, that play everything I want that that kind of experience I don't find the PC online
814.68,819.4, experiences enriched anymore because I'd rather play on the live right and why why
819.4,823.4, is that because I have easy access to all my friends I know what everybody's doing all
823.4,827.0799999999999, the time we can get together on games easy we can voice chat built in I don't have to
827.0799999999999,831.8, run been trillow or you know you don't speak you don't get inspired stuff you know what
831.8,835.72, I best of the experiment I don't run the background so Xbox live takes care of all
835.72,840.4399999999999, that yeah if I have that I don't need it would PC gamers I think we found our work
840.4399999999999,843.24, rounds around it and it's funny because you know talking to some of the other people
843.24,847.16, and one up staff and chain you know and Tories PC haters always cite those very
847.16,851.64, reasons for online it's too difficult to come together so for me someone who plays PC
851.64,854.92, games online every day I always say well what's the problem here because it's not
854.92,858.76, an issue for me but instead of I realize what I do is I have an existing network of friends
858.76,862.36, through aim and whatnot we talk through there and say hey let's get into teams speak and
862.36,866.12, then in teams speak we decide what game we're going to play and then we spread our IP around
866.12,870.4399999999999, that way and stuff and so we make it work but it's very rough and it's it has no
870.4399999999999,874.4399999999999, or none of the elegance of Xbox live we can't think about you just described yeah you could
874.44,877.8800000000001, be playing another game and you can say send them a voice message that will pop up
877.8800000000001,881.1600000000001, while they're playing that says hey dumbass turn that off and complete this game whatever
881.1600000000001,885.96, you know that's exactly what you do that's exactly what you do and play in that crap
885.96,891.0, and now I'm that that's exactly basically like expire works on that same methodology I think
891.0,895.24, the only thing that we should be able to do is incorporate my aim account into it so
895.24,900.44, I don't have like 30 programs open at once okay so your Microsoft go buy expire
901.4000000000001,905.32, there you go Peter go buy there's your advice and go buy expire well next step in the
905.32,911.1600000000001, Renaissance buy X fire or how about just you know make I mean it's just too simple to
911.1600000000001,915.72, simplify to say just make Xbox live work on the PC
915.72,918.6800000000001, well I just want to get the expire guys similar because I know a lot of people around that's
918.6800000000001,922.84, floor use it I mean expire really is a great product I mean I've seen kimi uses it like crazy
922.84,926.9200000000001, she loves it you guys use it I just go into world of warcraft and talk to my friends
927.24,932.92, that's the other thing that PC 2 is that I mean the whole Xbox 360 set up is different
932.92,936.52, that people have a game one day they're playing burnout then the next they're expected to buy
936.52,940.8399999999999, something else then they're playing you know perfect dark together or something or is you know
940.8399999999999,944.8399999999999, Jeff you're going to be playing one game forever and you can build these relationships and you
944.8399999999999,948.92, don't need to be able to like transfer this info like instantaneously it's like if you meet someone
948.92,953.88, that's fine they'll be you'll run in them in the same places all the time in the same game and so
953.88,957.48, you know even with the shooters and stuff it doesn't have quite the longevity but it's like I've
957.48,961.88, been playing battlefield two since it launched you know so there's a similar sort of thing where
961.88,965.96, we don't have as much of a need to stay in touch with people because we're always in this doing the
965.96,971.96, same things in the same places where there's a lot more active and decentralized I think on 360
971.96,976.04, well yeah well what I mean like the same at the same point you could be playing battlefield two
976.04,978.92, Jeff will be playing world of warcraft and I'll be in city of villains we only want to like hook up
978.92,982.84, and do something else you know be nice to have some kind of centralized place to do it as opposed to
982.84,987.8000000000001, having to like organize my friends and there's the trophy case mentality because I mean the
987.8000000000001,992.6800000000001, yeah those scorecards are so that's pretty addictive yeah totally addictive and but there's like no
992.6800000000001,996.36, even though okay actually here's my here's my tip of the day for any 360 owners out there
997.1600000000001,1001.64, get get any EA sports title and just one and it's just semis season I don't even play the game
1001.64,1005.88, I just semis season I'm in jacking up my gamer score right so we've seen that trick
1006.6800000000001,1008.52, Darren's always got the work around doesn't he?
1009.48,1011.72, he's like the hook ups what are you doing?
1011.72,1015.96, improving man yeah actually it was kind of a joke with some friends of mine I just
1015.96,1019.88, see if we could just rank jack up our score even though we weren't playing the games so what do you
1019.88,1024.52, win with that? I get a cookie at the end of the week it gets about it I lose
1024.52,1030.12, credibility I mean actually said that's a serious question I mean do you get anything other than saying
1030.52,1034.92, you have this car I mean does that that's really it I mean if you're cheating it no but I mean
1034.92,1037.8799999999999, if you're not cheating you're just like showing what you have but you're planning having fun with
1037.96,1041.96, people can look at and say oh hey look how many achievements he has in perfect dark I know he plays
1041.96,1045.96, that a lot of whatever it goes for 360 NPC but if they did that and say hey look you get enough
1045.96,1051.16, achievement points and you can buy yourself a demo you know a two-day demo yeah yeah that's nice
1051.16,1057.64, on your PC or even some chaacheke or something buy yourself you know a different color helmet
1057.64,1062.2800000000002, for your game or something like that and then you start creating problems with memory and stuff
1062.2800000000002,1066.8400000000001, there when you when you do that but to me there's a slight loser factor there though of like the
1066.9199999999998,1071.3999999999999, high the higher the score there you have a slightly from the well master now talking about
1071.3999999999999,1077.24, these are factors hey the I'm someone who I do not type you know slash played anymore because I don't
1077.24,1081.6399999999999, want to know how many hours because yeah it's kind of pathetic I don't want to know I've spent
1081.6399999999999,1085.48, good stop worrying about it you have fun with which you have fun with two busy type slash pizza
1086.6799999999998,1090.6799999999998, that's ever quest but you know like you talk about working around there at one of pepperoni
1090.6799999999998,1095.32, there's work around in the in the in the communities for MMOs as well so like you've got sites
1095.32,1099.72, like a lot to say and where you have like you can build your uh your avatar online and show
1099.72,1103.48, all the gear that you've gotten show that kind of stuff off right that could so easily be part of
1103.48,1108.36, life and it would be you know hey here's Jeff Green here's his avatar and wow here's the stuff he's
1108.36,1111.3999999999999, got here's the achievements he's earned here's where he is right now
1111.3999999999999,1115.96, chaps right now I don't want people to know
1117.0,1124.76, aren't you the Jeff Green now time the other Jeff Green right anybody of anything else here
1125.56,1131.3999999999999, how are we doing on time how long you want to go it's your show man let's let's talk all day
1131.3999999999999,1135.1599999999999, all right yeah I don't want to get lines let's just hang out here you're nothing better to do
1135.8,1138.6, all right we're gonna keep talking out there actually now we're not gonna keep talking out there
1138.6,1144.12, think we're gonna we're gonna wrap it up right here uh in the same windows as any final words
1144.12,1149.8, to say on the subject of of windows and Microsoft and gaming are we looking forward to seeing
1149.8,1154.84, Microsoft's booth at E3 this year well um rise of legends looking forward to that
1154.84,1159.0, do I'm totally looking forward to that actually hot I've been so bored with RTS and then I played
1159.0,1164.28, that game and I'm like well this game's hot yeah and um how about Vanguard how we feel about
1164.28,1168.76, Vanguard how we feel about Vanguard well I'll I'll tell you guys what I told the guys from
1168.76,1173.3999999999999, from from schedule when they came in a couple weeks ago when I first saw the game years ago to me
1173.3999999999999,1178.12, it looked like a D&D cat I want to play an architecture game because you know it has all this
1178.12,1182.6, you know gamer housing well that that was a lesson in how not to demo it just don't demo it
1182.6799999999998,1185.9599999999998, when all you have is buildings right you know you gotta have achievement points
1188.12,1192.36, yeah that's an achievement point no but actually it's it it is looking better it is looking better
1192.36,1197.0, it's it's a it's a I think it's like a high fantasy stuff so I mean like it's not exactly like
1197.0,1201.32, for me and it's Brad McQuay it's with super hard if you're not in the high fantasy what are you
1201.32,1208.84, in do uh I mean I mean the wearing superhero tates and mid-linked fantasy game occasionally low fantasy
1208.9199999999998,1213.48, oh in the games oh that's different uh yeah you know um and what also are we gonna see how
1213.48,1218.36, to Microsoft the C3 well I I'm gonna I'm gonna keep the rumor watch to a minimum but I do
1218.36,1221.6399999999999, know of some stuff that's coming up I'm pretty psyched for if I actually go ahead with the plans
1222.6,1227.8, that's all I'll tell you guys off my Mister Insider here Mister Insider stay tuned stay tuned for
1227.8,1232.52, for big scoops from Darren Glenn yeah no actually um but I think it has been announced that they
1232.52,1236.84, they do have intentions to bring uh Garrett gears and war to the PC at some point yeah I think they've
1237.1599999999999,1239.3999999999999, talked about that they've talked about that I'm really looking forward to that and hopefully they'll
1239.3999999999999,1243.72, have some to show it E3 yeah unreal three engine stuff so me smoking hot definitely smoking hot
1243.72,1248.9199999999998, well so I think like Charlie Brown with the football we're gonna go to E3 we're gonna walk up to that
1248.9199999999998,1253.8, to the Microsoft football and see if Lucy pulls it away from us once again so I don't know I mean
1253.8,1258.36, the thing you're gonna see with this is because because the fact that Vista requires direct X9 cards
1258.36,1263.6399999999999, so they pull the GDI layer out you're gonna see a huge improvement in how well PCs can run games
1263.72,1267.64, so that's let's see that's the takeaway that I've had from the talk about this I was completely
1267.64,1273.16, couldn't care less about this than until I heard hey there's no more GDI you get 35-40% performance increase
1273.8000000000002,1278.92, was like whoa okay that's motivation yeah oh you don't actually there's uh there's one thing
1278.92,1282.44, that I was just thinking up that I totally forgot before it was like one thing they they really need
1282.44,1286.5200000000002, to do to improve the image for PC gaming in general is not make it when I want to go into an EB or
1286.5200000000002,1291.16, something I don't want to feel like I'm walking into a ghetto section of the store you got you got
1291.16,1295.48, sort of like the back porn out section of a video just like not gonna know what those are like
1296.52,1300.92, they won't even buy your games you come in with use games we don't want that how bad is that when
1300.92,1305.8000000000002, they turn you away they're only gonna offer you 10 to 15 cents as it was and then they won't even
1305.8000000000002,1310.1200000000001, give you that we can't even leave it with them for free no actually I did it last Christmas had a bunch
1310.1200000000001,1313.3200000000002, of games I wasn't playing anymore I just walked into EB I just dropped them right on the counter I said
1313.96,1317.88, whoever wants one take one thank you not a hair you can't chase me out of the store with a broom
1318.1200000000001,1324.2, sad okay we'll tell Michael's stuff to buy EB and increase their shelves based on the front
1324.2,1328.3600000000001, well actually they've been talking about some like Walmart's and stuff like that and they do have
1328.3600000000001,1333.24, some kind of plan basically in the same way you see a ps2 section or a Xbox section they're gonna
1333.24,1338.5200000000002, have a full on the least the plan is to have unified case design kind of like what you see with the
1338.5200000000002,1343.4, right electronic arts and that's what part of a peanut word was talking about a dice was you
1343.48,1348.68, uniform case design as well simplified installation right and it's kind of what they talked about when
1348.68,1352.68, they were here is of how they reorganized themselves to where PC games is no longer separate from
1352.68,1357.0800000000002, their game group it's now you know all one big happy game group family why did they take so long
1357.0800000000002,1362.1200000000001, a standardized cases so most of us like mere at the point where we don't even want this anymore I mean
1362.1200000000001,1366.8400000000001, where I have a chance we just want this is going right yeah we we'd he get you should together a little
1366.84,1372.76, too late after the fact that I think that is true isn't it isn't this maybe the last year of
1372.76,1377.72, discs last couple years well it's even the last year of discs or people are just gonna like
1377.72,1381.6399999999999, they're gonna increase the so ridiculous amount of content so instead of having like I mean
1381.6399999999999,1386.28, there are some games we're seeing now it like six seven CD installs right it reminds me of the
1386.28,1390.76, days back just before the adoption of CD ROMs well look ever quest two when it first came out
1391.32,1398.52, came on six eight I don't know how many CDs 20 but now it's a direct download from
1398.52,1402.68, file planet I think it's just a special offer on Prime Minister's supposed to be plugging file planet
1402.68,1407.96, don't go there don't go to file plan but they don't you don't you go there but they do but you can
1407.96,1412.92, directly download ever quest there so that's the entire game that at one point was on multiple CD and
1412.92,1417.64, they and you can get it for free that's well there's that yeah and every time again every time you
1417.64,1421.4, switch computers you don't have to move with all that stuff and I wonder you guys readers tell you
1421.4,1425.24, that I mean they're still a group out there that wants CDs right well I think I want to dis I
1425.24,1429.88, think the real trick is like you know where's broadband adoption that's I totally agree with you
1429.88,1433.3200000000002, I mean like I mean like we live in a we you know we live in San Francisco so we're pretty hooked
1433.3200000000002,1437.16, up and that's not a problem but you start getting to them you know middle America other random
1437.16,1441.72, more remote part but we know our readers are hooked up we know the 95% of the people reading our
1441.72,1447.24, magazine have broadband those are the people who are also gonna spend the most money on games
