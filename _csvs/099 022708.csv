247.76,254.92, wanted to thank publicly thank Andrew skip. Fistor for last week's monumental. Amazing job
254.92,259.71999999999997," of putting together those GFW radio and one of yours podcast. So I'm very, very, very"
259.71999999999997,264.64," very, very. He that did was work and harder than anybody else at ZF last week. And so"

271.2,274.47999999999996," you might if I get us on track back in the middle of the world of PC gaming. Oh, sure. If"
274.47999999999996,278.91999999999996, you feel the need to take us somewhere else under the Mandy more go ahead. Should get a
278.91999999999996,284.88," conversation started just in that ever. Since last week, we were busy podcasting. Yeah."
284.88,289.44," Every day, you know, multiple times a day in some of our cases, we didn't really get to go"
289.44,294.24," over to the game, you know, develop a conference to go to any of the show, show us floor space."
294.24,299.04, Uh-huh. And just kind of like browse around and see what was there. But we did on Friday. And
299.04,305.04, I went with Sean and Anthony. And I know both of you and Ryan got to go over there too. And
305.04,309.92," we found some pretty cool stuff. Some scientific wonders. Do you want to talk about the, uh,"
309.92,315.68, what's it called? The personal I max. We've got a full list of things to go through. I guess
315.68,320.48, I figure we can like just take turns alternating talking about. Okay. So I'll kick it off with
320.48,327.84000000000003," the personal I max. Um, it's a fine product known as the Z dome. Like what's up with that, too? They're like"
327.84000000000003,337.36, the Z people like the Z board. The Z dome. Is that it's a Z deal. M E Z. Yeah. Yeah. And what this thing is is it
337.36,344.48," looks like just this big, you know, parabolic dish, some kind of analgesic geodesic dome. And"
345.04,351.04," no, it's just this big, you know, dish and you stand in it and a projector projects your game"
351.04,356.0," onto the inside of it. So it creates a pseudo 3D effect when you stand in the middle of it. So if,"
356.0,360.56," you know, tip it's immersive. If you're playing the game and whatever's on the far left of the screen"
360.56,364.88, or whatever's on the far right would be like in an FPS it would be what's actually on on your left
364.88,369.52000000000004," right. Is this just any game? Any game? Yeah. So it's not it doesn't have to be built. No,"
369.52,374.08, they were doing it with the Assassin's Creed or movie. Anything that can work through projector.
374.08,377.91999999999996, So like the jewel you could do it. So they're thinking super Mario Brothers.
378.64,383.68," I just see this ridiculous thing. I mean, we, we, we were actually there. We decided that we were"
383.68,388.96," gonna hunt for weird science. Yeah. So when we saw this dome and we saw people standing around it,"
388.96,395.68," we immediately flock to it and the guy who had, it was like this old mustache, you do"
396.0,399.92, who brought it there and immediately I think it was like Anthony. It was like this guy got kicked off
399.92,405.12," America so you want to be an inventor or whatever. Yeah. You know, there's like that show where it's"
405.12,410.16, like a gong show for an mentions that dude got kicked off like in the first round. But he was there.
410.16,415.6, He somehow paid for floor space. And in some way it was kind of cool. It was like a look in the future
416.48,423.68," that is like decidedly retro. Like in the way that you, you remember when that set 3D live action"
423.68,428.0," game came out it was like, you know, time, time, copper, something and it was based on the"
428.0,432.08," hologram one, the hologram, the hologram and it was, it played like dragons layer something. You know,"
432.08,438.24," you move left or right or upper down on, on cue. And basically the movie plays out but it had"
438.24,443.52," this sort of pseudo 3D effect to it and you look at it and you're like, I could see that this is"
443.52,447.92," supposed to be futuristic but it, but maybe more so like a buck rod, there's episode filmed"
448.0,455.84000000000003, with like 1979. So the sad thing is this thing kicks off. The Z don't kicks off so much glare
455.84000000000003,460.48, that that's all I was really seeing is just the glare that you had to play in the dark. Yeah.
460.48,467.12," Right. He said it was not a best environment for the Z dome. And the other, you know,"
467.12,471.92, prominent features that's enormous. The thing was like 10 feet tall. It's like a bullet point.
471.92,476.48," Yeah, you'd have to like saw your, another couple feet of space in your front door to get in"
476.48,481.04," your house. You have to say, but remember he also said that it, the, the final product has the"
481.04,488.48," projector built into the right thing. So it's like this 12 foot long beast. Oh, giant a big plastic enclosure."
488.48,494.16," Because the projector is like, there's several feet behind the dome. And because it's, I don't know,"
494.16,499.28000000000003, he apparently was dissatisfied that it was just sitting back there. He wanted to close it in. So that's
499.28000000000003,505.36," another like, I don't know, fully dozing light. That'd be so great to bring to your left spouser partner,"
505.36,509.76," whatever, you know, hi, honey, I'm home. Look what I got. You'd have to be the guy"
509.76,515.28, fucking thing at it. You guys from a whole movie that lives in like the robotic house. At least one of
515.28,520.88," that's watch. I was in a movie. Yeah. No. Well, this, that guy had a whole movie, of course, we talked"
520.88,524.08," about the documentary in the made American movie, but that's just one on people living in"
524.08,529.12," Northodox, you know, living spaces. And this guy's got all this shitty contraptions and stuff."
529.12,534.0," But you know, an example of why this guy is so red. Is that just living room is on a rotating"
534.0,538.32," diet, kind of thing. When you're sitting in this, you know, you're on one of his couches and he doesn't"
538.32,541.52, like you. He flips a switch and it just rotates you so that you're suddenly outside.
541.52,547.44, Nice. And you just outside. That's super villain. I could use that. Yeah. So what else do we
547.44,552.72," shoot there? There you guys. Wait, wait. Oh, that question's about this. I do. I just wonder, is there any"
552.72,558.96," world in which this might be cool? Like a Ricky Schroeder from Silver Spoon's like, it's a"
558.96,564.08, prop for a TV sitcom for like a spoiled rich kid. You don't know about it. When you have
564.08,570.24," a four eight year old like me, like, oh, shit. He's got set up he did his all. All I saw when I stepped"
570.24,576.72, into the Z-Dome was the like the lights on the ceiling like in very bizarre floating positions next to my face.
576.72,581.44, And I barely saw Assassin's Creed. So I don't know. Plus you have a design something to like.
581.44,584.72, You can't get the set. There's nothing cool. There's no reason. Yeah. Yeah.
584.96,589.0400000000001," They didn't even get the price. That would have been the well, it's not he didn't know at this point,"
589.0400000000001,592.72," though, is what he said. He kind of just, you know, feeling the crowd. I think he was helping"
592.72,595.76, him. There's someone would want to buy a pat and off him. There's all these. All right. All right.
595.76,599.76," Well, he said he's like this. He custom builds these for like the military. That's right now."
599.76,602.8000000000001," Oh, I go. That I heard that one a lot. Military application. Yeah."
602.8000000000001,606.88, Yeah. That's when you know soldiers like get in there and they are like making fun of it because
606.88,610.8000000000001," they're like shit. This is supposed to be Uncle Sam. It's like, I got better technology. My living room."
611.76,616.4," That could go to the PX and get better, better tech. It's a classic."
617.52,622.4," So so, and BX was pretty hot. We all saw that and you want to break it down."
623.04,630.4799999999999, You want to? Yeah. It's a series of speakers and fans. You set them up around you. Don't forget the
630.4799999999999,634.9599999999999," lights. Okay. Well, the speakers have lights on top of them that change according to the game."
634.9599999999999,640.4," So like when I saw a demo, it was like a warhammer online thing. And when the wizard would go to cast a spell,"
640.88,646.0," like the spell was blue so the lights would dim blue. And then when she'd cast it, the fans would"
646.0,651.92, blow on your face. And as well as the wizard on GFW radio and the context of the train
651.92,656.56," soon, which is what they sent like a press release on before. But that's spell thing. That's a little"
656.56,662.56," better. Yeah. Well, and you checked it out with a quake. Yeah. That's just like a color organ. That was"
662.56,670.24," a mercy. It is. Yeah. Basically. Oh, and it has the vibrating. All the vibrating ergonomics."
670.24,675.2, Yeah. Rest rest. Yeah. Rest rest. The keyboard. It is basically like a rumble pack for your keyboard.
675.2,681.28, You're just rests on a rumble case. You want to wrist a rumble pack on their keyboard. You mean like
681.28,685.2, your keyboard vibrating while you're playing? Right when the rumble pack was taken into
685.2,692.5600000000001," their console controller. I get, that makes more sense to me. Really? The one I like. I don't know."
692.5600000000001,697.6, None of them. I don't like the idea of my keyboard rumbling. It's such a keyboard. It's just the
697.6,701.6, thing you rest. All the pad that you're in. Yes. I don't know. You said you kind of dug it when
701.6,705.84," you were trying to look at that far cry too. Demo, right? The wind on your face. I was kind of like,"
706.4,713.44," okay. I was kind of swept up in it. Really? Well, first, you're playing, you know, what"
713.44,717.76," does? I was playing Quake 3. And I didn't even, I mean, I'm paying attention to the screen. You're playing"
717.76,721.28, a death match game. I'm not going to notice that these lights are turning red when I go into a red
721.28,724.4," room where they're going to turn green when I go into, you know, predominantly green color"
724.48,728.72," game room. I didn't even know that they were there. It was completely stupid, right? But maybe"
728.72,732.64," the fan was supposed to be like, oh, you're running. You could feel like the wind in your face."
732.64,737.52, And that was ridiculous. It was just a mismatch. Completely idiotic way to showcase your technology.
738.0799999999999,742.56," However, when you go up to the Far Cry 2 demo and all what was doing was playing, you know,"
743.6,750.64, a movie of in-game engine. And so would be out on this African Savannah in a wind is blowing through
750.64,756.0," in the game space. You know, it's knocking over, you know, blowing the brush down and you can see the"
758.0,762.48, branches and the trees wiggling and stuff. And then when the wind was blowing in conjunction with
762.48,765.92," that, it was like, this isn't that bad. Because it kind of gave me that vibe and, you know, when I was"
765.92,770.0," playing. And I thought of like, it would have been cool and stalker when all these atmospheric"
770.0,774.88, anomalies kick up and it's just kind of like creepy and quiet. And you're walking around. And you're
774.88,778.72," kind of like filling in the rest of the blanks anyway. Like, I mean, so to speak with your"
778.72,782.32," mind, you're like, you know, just putting yourself in the experience, like, just imagining"
782.32,788.08, you're here. And so the fan is dumb as it sounds. It kind of like worked because it was timed well.
788.08,792.1600000000001," Like it would be like, there would be a gust. You'd feel it. And you'd see all, you know, that the"
792.1600000000001,798.08," leaves bend over. You're like, I can't hate on for that. If it was cheap, if it was really cheap,"
799.44,804.08," I don't know, just how cheap. But what they should do though, now get full, like weather effects"
804.08,808.64, in there. It's like when it's raining. It's double raining. It's like rains on you. Just like
808.64,812.24, fill the thing up with water. It's smell. You do it like there's some gazellamineware that's
812.24,817.6," good. Oh, right. You're known. That'll be that would happen. Maybe next year's CDC. I'm sure"
817.6,822.72," will. I mean, the people already working on, you know, versions of this. I have a like licensed"
822.72,827.6, this technology out to any other people who who want to make these wacky sensory peripherals from.
827.6,831.0400000000001," That'd be great. So you see, Harry, you're walking"
831.04,839.1999999999999," by some poo. And notice if you inhale now, inhale a little bit. See? Smells like poo."
839.1999999999999,844.48, That does smell like poop. Very realistic. So you sound like you're sold on this one.
844.48,848.48, I don't know about that. Maybe just the thing. What is this? What up? What up yours now?
850.48,855.5999999999999," I love it. I'm willing to be a spob. I'm so smart. I'm like, it's a, we're things suddenly"
855.6,862.72," go from like, oh, he says the breeze was kind of okay to hot. They have to. You advocate this"
862.72,871.76," thing. No, you love it. Don't you? I didn't shame that. So Sean, what about your"
871.76,876.4," cyclops from the X-Men technology? Yeah. Oh, though. I wish you remember what it was called."
876.4,883.0400000000001," But basically, it was this technology where there was a camera. This one was attached to the"
883.52,888.48, eye-culture thing. Yeah. It basically scangerize. You stand there for like 10 seconds while
888.48,891.76, it celebrates. And you like look at all these different points on the screen. And then
893.04,898.56, you control the screen just by looking at it. So they had a demo of like creepy. These
898.56,901.8399999999999, spaceships flying at you. And you just looked at the spaceships and they would blow.
901.8399999999999,907.5999999999999," Wow. As if you had heat vision. That's fucking awesome. But yeah, it was actually fairly accurate."
907.5999999999999,912.24," Yeah, it was fairly accurate. There's a bit of a lag. Like it was kind of spiky. It would jump around."
912.24,917.28," But in the game, they were demoing looked like an SNES like Tom Ngan. Not you know that."
917.28,923.12," Yeah, it was it wasn't for games. It was again, it was again just like two like six-year-old"
923.12,927.76," engineers from, you know, so it's a tech demo. Yeah. And again, they were like, I'm not really"
927.76,931.76, up. Exactly. And they said people have been using it that are like paralyzed for years to control
931.76,936.4, their computer and stuff. So they just want to see if they can find a way to sell it to the
936.4,940.4," pricing. Well, like, and then they brought up like a paint program. But it was like, it was like a giant"
940.48,945.28, block so you can't accurately paint with it. But it was definitely falling my eyes and it was a really
945.28,952.24," creepy. So work. If you have glasses. Oh, that's a good question. Probably not. That's a good question."
952.24,957.12, So work for people with very poor eyesight. They work fine like where they were set up. They were just kind of like
957.12,963.4399999999999," at the back end of some, you know, the low rent row and the lights were all wacky. And"
964.0799999999999,967.6," so since it might get on to use that for something like coloring, even coloring a box like when"
967.6800000000001,973.2," your eyes, like you'd started like gone, like, cross-eyed and like back. So long, I could be"
973.2,977.36, application of filling the box. The first thing that comes to mind would be like in an art
977.36,982.08," yes for like unit selection. I mean, I don't know how you would indicate to it like the equivalent"
982.08,987.36," of a click. But I mean, if you're just selecting your unit by like eyesight, you know, yeah, you"
987.36,993.6," need some kind of binary like. So you're not just the difference between a look and an active look,"
993.84,1000.64," you know, to combine this with the mind control helmet. There we have it. I could see like in an RTS,"
1000.64,1007.12," like so you would still have the mouse moving your look, your main look, and then the keyboard"
1007.12,1011.84," moving your body, but your eyes would control cursor of your gun. So you would still be able to look"
1011.84,1015.9200000000001, out of it then you could look and control where your guns pointing just by looking. Kind of like
1015.9200000000001,1019.44, basically like track I are. Yeah. It's apt. You don't need to wear anything.
1019.5200000000001,1024.96," Hey, guys. Just knows where you're staring. It's like that you have to hold a really still up with your eyes."
1025.52,1029.68," Yeah, that just be more awesome even in real life. It was fun. It's like,"
1030.3200000000002,1035.52," cyclops. There's shit and explodes. Yeah. Yeah, the where my childhood dream. Yeah, that is"
1035.52,1039.1200000000001, to make you go around wearing Ruby Quint. They need to make all day and we're going to play your game.
1039.1200000000001,1044.96, You take them off. They just need to make one release you get. They need to make cyclops the
1044.96,1054.48, gamer. You just hold some glasses and with them. You gotta be careful because you don't want to
1054.48,1060.72," like set like you know, a jean gray on fire. Right, that'd be it one. Yeah, they got five sales right here in"
1060.72,1068.24, this room. So did you guys see the mind control how much to or I only saw it. So I did. I guess there
1068.24,1073.2, were two because there's the emotive and then there's the like neurone at or something else that I
1073.2,1076.8, came up with. It's called I must say we got to give credit where it's due. I think it was Robert
1076.8,1080.56, Ashley. We were telling him about this and he was already envisioning a game where you like
1081.04,1087.44, have X-ray vision and mentally like strip women's clothes off. Bye. Like look at the one thing.
1088.0,1091.6000000000001, He wasn't saying like he wanted it but he was like saying that's the first game. This is what's
1091.6000000000001,1097.1200000000001," gonna happen with this. Yeah. Wow. No, it's gonna be a Jedi game where you just tell people what"
1097.1200000000001,1101.44, to do by thinking about it. That's right out of an episode of extras. You guys have ever watched
1101.44,1107.92," it show with the Ricky Dervace. And he had John the Picard on. Oh, I saw that one. Yeah, on the YouTube."
1107.92,1112.4," Yeah, playing playing himself as they always do on that show and he was running all these different"
1112.4,1119.3600000000001, script and story ideas by by Ricky Dervace. John the Picard was an every idea was that the
1119.3600000000001,1124.72, net result was and then the women take off their clothes. Those every single thing. You did a
1124.72,1132.0," justice justice job. Sorry, hilarious. Sorry, can we just add it that out? Anyway, so they had to"
1132.0,1136.96, two other like mind interfaces there. I didn't get to I saw them from afar. I didn't get to try
1136.96,1143.44, there. We had a first thing. Boyer is got to play with them and he said and basically these are you put
1143.44,1148.32, this it's not like you staple electrodes. You have to shave your scalp and tape electrodes if you're
1148.32,1153.76," soft, but you put that's great. This fairly star trek look and thing around the the crown of your head."
1154.48,1161.12," And then you just think in the game reacts and kind. Yeah, he said it worked well. I don't even know"
1161.12,1166.08," what he was saying. He did just moving objects around and pushing blocks. Yeah, yeah, I think about moving"
1166.08,1171.84, the chair and then it moves or something. And he said it worked. So it didn't seem to work for the
1171.84,1176.08," people. Everyone that was standing there while I was standing. Oh, I'm sorry. There's like a long line"
1176.1599999999999,1179.6, because everyone had to try it. Maybe some people just don't have good telekin. They probably
1179.6,1185.04, got that's what the guy was doing. That was good. That was a good park. Mental image of you. You
1185.04,1189.84," cannot control the block. And it's probably just like a block, right, or a chair or whatever."
1189.84,1194.0," They had like so then they it's sort of like a clairvoyant. They can just guess. Well, if we put a block"
1194.0,1198.8," in there, they're going to think they're going to move it. Right. But also it's why your gauge would be"
1198.8,1203.1999999999998, specifics like if Chris feels like I want to move this block like three and a quarter and just to
1203.68,1208.48, the right. And then it did that as opposed to just moving it really that accurate. Maybe they got
1208.48,1213.04," a guy who would have another like three and just the other direction. If it worked along,"
1213.04,1218.0," they probably had a guy sitting under there, you know, like with a curtain over the cable. And Chris"
1218.0,1222.0," was going like, I told it to move to the right. Why is it just moving? And then the guy goes going,"
1222.0,1226.32," oh fuck. No, he's like with a magnet in the ether. Oh, yeah, it's a little bit like there."
1226.32,1231.52, Cause it's going to the right now. Right. I like the whole angle though. We're like the guys like blaming
1231.6,1240.24," you. It's like your mental, your mental, your mental, midget. I do the sky only special people can"
1240.24,1245.28," do it. He would go to the Benny, him, faith healing things and he would go there for entertainment."
1246.72,1249.52, Just get all quiet. I afraid of my left. Jeff's already got into apology to make
1250.4,1254.6399999999999," our Muslim list. We've been doing this so long. Sean can read my mind. Don't bust on religion,"
1254.64,1260.64," that's Sean. But no, no, he and he said he'd go these faith healing things and he,"
1261.3600000000001,1266.72, he got a kick out of it until they brought someone up there who was just so clearly and truly crippled.
1266.72,1270.5600000000002," And then they couldn't do anything with the guy. Cause you know, Benny handle like kind of push you"
1270.5600000000002,1274.5600000000002, and you'll fall down and then you're supposed to get up all as well. And you're having a
1274.5600000000002,1278.4, journey. But they couldn't do anything with this guy who isn't the chair. And so then they start
1278.4,1283.2," blaming him like, oh, you have little faith, you know, like it's wow. So I'm just bringing it back"
1283.28,1288.0800000000002, by way of unnecessary analogy to the reason why the blocks were moving in the right direction.
1289.68,1295.76," Oh, I can can I go off on a tangent just before I forget speaking of unnecessary. Okay, just just my apology."
1295.76,1303.1200000000001, How about we might to deny you that? You could. I just want to apologize. Speaking of unnecessary
1303.1200000000001,1312.0," and offensive because a guy wrote me from, uh, he wrote me last week about the podcast and what Sean"
1312.08,1318.8," and I've talked about the taxi, the crazy taxi story. And this is a guy who's a loyal reader of ours."
1318.8,1324.8," And uh, well, I say I got second a street when he said, uh, I love your magazine podcast."
1324.8,1329.28," Number one, just agree with them. I am Arab. I'm Muslim. I heard you recent story about the taxi,"
1329.28,1335.04, which is very funny. I laughed hard. Same thing where I live here in Ottawa. But it's one of
1335.12,1338.32," the one that won a little thing. Please turn it up to terrorist. stereotype of all Arabs,"
1339.52,1346.08," Muslims is crazy mofos with bombs. I'm not. I'm a gamer. Not some crazy idiot, idiot."
1346.08,1353.04," Boba, Boba. So yeah, I do apologize if I made that. If I made some kind of joke on."
1353.04,1357.44," You were so quite joking. You did joke. Of course I was joking. We're kind of like, uh,"
1358.24,1362.8," just say that. And you were clearly joking. Of course I was joking. And the context even then,"
1362.8,1370.08," even in the context of joke, it wasn't that all Arabs or Muslims either are in saying terrorist."
1370.08,1375.12, But that a guy who was just talking about how he was arrested for refusing to snitch.
1376.1599999999999,1381.52," And then, you know, it was kind of like disturbing you in other ways. And that we were, we were"
1381.52,1388.96, exaggerating for comedic effect. Right. Then he scared you. You're joking. Right. Right. So there's a difference.
1388.96,1396.32," And really it's more just that it's like taxi drivers at, you know, midnight with who"
1396.32,1401.44, ran below on tend to be the crazy ones. It had nothing to do with his ethnicity or religion. Right.
1401.44,1406.48," You know, shit. The last camera we got Anthony was worried for me because we had dropped him off"
1406.48,1410.24," and, uh, Oakland where he lives and then he was taking me to my place. And it was just some like"
1410.24,1414.88," old white hippie guy for some reason. Anthony, he worried Anthony just because he was talking"
1415.68,1419.3600000000001," you're, do you like Jim Crochi? Do you like Jim Crow? He kept on asking. He kept on asking."
1421.1200000000001,1424.96, He kept on asking. Wow. Whenever he asked a question that when we'd go to answer the turn of the
1424.96,1429.7600000000002," music, I learned a lot every time did you notice that eventually was so loud. So what he was like"
1429.7600000000002,1435.3600000000001," making time in a bottle. And then when I said see it, a shot and he was like, oh, see."
1435.3600000000001,1439.44," I was like, that's weird. They say, I don't know where I'm going because we got a ride from the"
1439.44,1445.1200000000001," set from San Francisco. It's like, I never come over here. So back on the back to take us,"
1445.1200000000001,1449.3600000000001," you know, listeners back to the GDC. Yes. It's the other item. I don't even know what is called."
1449.3600000000001,1456.3200000000002, It's basically a vest and interactive vest and helmet. And you put the vest on and it was described
1456.3200000000002,1460.0800000000002," to me by Chris Bitton is having a number of inflatable rings inside of it and that it's,"
1460.0800000000002,1465.3600000000001," well, I say vest don't think of like, you know, some, uh, Abercrombian fidget sweater or, you know,"
1465.4399999999998,1469.9199999999998," LL being catalog type stuff. Think of like an at enormous, you know, life vest, you know,"
1469.9199999999998,1473.36," the kind that you hate to wear. You know, you go somewhere and they're like, you have to wear your"
1473.36,1477.6," life vest at all times as soon as you're out of like visibility, whoever told it to you take it off."
1477.6,1485.1999999999998," It's like one of these. And as you're shot in the game, these, these rings will instantly inflate"
1485.1999999999998,1490.4799999999998," and various parts of the vest to stimulate that, you know, you're being hit. And then similarly,"
1490.64,1496.56," the helmet has an inflatable band on the liner. And that will, to inflate to various, you know,"
1496.56,1502.72," PSI or whatever in a different season. And I feel like hits are uh, whizzing by your head and"
1502.72,1507.28, and Chris Bitton's described it. The helmet is just like shaking around on his head and falling
1507.28,1512.72," on the side. It looks like just idiotic, a tragedy. Well, I do that's like, you know, the bolts are"
1512.72,1517.92," knocking it off your head. You got to put it back on. But so yeah, that sounds fun to you. You're like sitting"
1518.4,1526.3200000000002," there. The dream is is if we could hook up all these things together. So no, you put the vest on"
1526.88,1532.0800000000002, you go inside the Z dome. But you also have the fans from ambiex and there and some other lights around
1532.0800000000002,1536.96, the perimeter. You've got your eyeball thing so that you can stare whatever and you've got your brain
1536.96,1542.96," control going at the same time. And then um, there was another trap shot I do want to talk about that."
1542.96,1547.3600000000001," It was cool. Of all of them that are kind of like what? Well, there's one one more that you guys"
1547.36,1552.8," checked out. It was like a we-mote type, uh, lightsaber thing. Yeah. Oh yeah. It was, I think"
1552.8,1557.9199999999998, pretty much what it was. It was just a way more accurate. We way more went to one. We saw a bunch of
1557.9199999999998,1563.12," different motion control things. But it was, it was very much like the dream everyone has of like"
1563.12,1568.24," holding a lightsaber with the weak controller. This was actually it. And I don't, I get the impression"
1568.24,1573.4399999999998," though that you know, we've had a we for however long I've had a we that that game is not going to be"
1573.52,1578.8, possible on a we. Yeah. But like this was very much like you were knocking. They had like a
1578.8,1582.88, a samurai dummy and you just you know you blocked with it when he swung at you and you knocked
1582.88,1585.92, off different pieces of armor depending on it. So it's pretty cool. It was really accurate and
1586.8,1590.88, wasn't nearly as laggy as some of the other ones have tried. But I don't know if it's just
1590.88,1595.6000000000001," a matter of like that particular prototype technology was like $1,000 and that's why I'm so accurate."
1595.6000000000001,1598.48, Right. But it'll get you. It's like the sad thing is that
1599.44,1605.3600000000001," few of any of these things will ever reach mass market on PC. But some will, I mean you're"
1605.3600000000001,1609.84, smart. But it's like right to stick in mass market. They're not going to really reach any market.
1609.84,1616.24, But some of that's the thing. All these people were here just like hoping for game developers to come
1616.24,1622.0, by and say like I would like to use this in my game. And this is definitely selling the MBX stuff.
1622.0,1626.24," Well, they are hoping to reach your mark. This was beyond the prototype. This was like the"
1626.24,1630.24, lighting's the technology. They want to sell it. They're they're selling it. That vests you were
1630.24,1635.84, talking about. They actually said someone who's making the best licensing the MBS MBX technology.
1635.84,1639.68, So I wonder if that was the same size I did. Yeah. That's the thing with MBX technology. It basically
1639.68,1644.8, just like it's like the communication channel from the game to any number. So it's not just
1644.8,1649.04, MBX is not just the lights or the fans. But it's basically anything you want to hook up to it
1649.68,1654.24," for additional, you know, force feedback or whatever it is lights. You know. Yeah. So if you the"
1654.24,1657.84," listener wanted to make the thing that releases the manure scent, go for it."
1657.84,1662.16," You think it's a toxic technology. Yeah. But even those eyeball things and stuff, we saw like"
1662.16,1666.72, developers that would walk up and designers and they'd be like really interested because every
1666.72,1670.8, they set they he like play at least cities like everyone's looking for that next guitar hero.
1670.8,1673.84, Yeah. Like something we can make a peripheral and sell it to everyone. Yeah.
1673.84,1679.28, Exactly. So you know on PC it's very unlikely. I mean you have to guitar here in a scenario
1679.28,1682.96, where do you do you have a killer app that you package it with and the two go together in a catch
1682.96,1689.3600000000001, on so people are willing to buy it. But so far that's pretty rare. But even a needs of all
1689.3600000000001,1694.56, things you're describing just sound like they all sound like a group. Right? They're like how to
1694.56,1699.76, make it feel like you're more in the environment. Exactly. Yeah. Immersive technologies. Yeah.
1699.76,1704.88, Right. And but it is cool because like the the weemo thing obviously we as a success
1705.44,1709.3600000000001, and they're going to have second generation technology at some point. Maybe with like the wee
1709.36,1713.4399999999998, two or whatever they call the other different name for it and then they will have something that
1713.4399999999998,1718.32, is capable of one to one because the you know technology care is going to do it staying and instead
1718.32,1722.6399999999999, of costing a thousand bucks they'll be able to produce them for you know 1495 in the right province
1722.6399999999999,1728.3999999999999, in China and then we'll all benefit by having and I say the tendo there is because they're able
1728.3999999999999,1732.6399999999999, to sell the entire thing at once and then people develop for it. But it's like now like the
1732.6399999999999,1736.56, no event Falcon which is a haptic device I've talked about a few other times and I played it again
1736.56,1740.8, and I don't tell you about their updates but um you know there's so many things you could do with
1740.8,1746.48, it but who's going to waste their time developing a game for an interface that maybe a thousand
1746.48,1751.52, people have if that right even if 20 thousand people have it they're still not going to do it right
1752.08,1757.52, but the the interesting thing with this is now there's always designed so that you know the
1757.52,1761.9199999999998, controller part comes off of the swing arm and you would just pop it off and now what they have
1761.92,1766.3200000000002, is like they have like a pistol grip which works well with shooters I mean it feels like now
1766.3200000000002,1770.24, so you look on the screen you're holding your gun and now you're holding it and it's kicking
1770.24,1775.04, and you're using it to turn and look around on the screen um that was cool they had an actual
1775.04,1778.88, instead of just this ball they had an ergonomic kind of had to feel of an intendo controller or
1778.88,1784.88, something an ergonomic plug-in and I tried that with the game called gish that you know that's available
1784.88,1790.16, now in any in a general form it doesn't use a haptic interface it was like the independent
1790.16,1794.3200000000002, game's festival winter from two years back it's also on steam and the basically in this game
1794.3200000000002,1800.0, here there's this ball and you can change its density so that like if you want to break through
1800.0,1805.6000000000001, something beneath you you get heavier you can get slippery or slippery or slippery or slippery
1805.6000000000001,1810.96, or the words of the three so to go through pipes and stuff sticky to climb up walls
1811.68,1816.0800000000002, and you bounce you jump by sort of bouncing so what they did is with the haptic device
1816.96,1821.76, um the interface is really streamlined too they put it'll put up like you know on the on the
1821.76,1828.08, version of this game so it'll be like gish haptic or something gish falcon and it'll say here's here's
1828.08,1832.08, what the commands are and it could remind you on the screen it looks like it was designed that way
1832.08,1836.72, and then it actually feels like you're holding the ball in your hand and moving it around the screen
1836.72,1840.8, so you could feel as it gains momentum and if you want to change its directions you could feel it
1840.8,1846.08, fighting against you or if you would make it heavier you feel it get heavy in your hand and then
1846.08,1852.8799999999999, when you bounce it part of the cough you take the controller in your hand and you feel the weight
1852.8799999999999,1857.36, and you kind of like bounce it up and down and you get the sense that you know again that that
1857.36,1862.6399999999999, you're feeling it or you're holding or something when it reacts when it's you know climbing up a wall
1862.6399999999999,1866.96, and it's sticky mode and stuff it was very cool that made the game go from an interesting
1867.04,1872.4, sort of IGF game to the kind of thing that like a good Nintendo game you know for one of their
1872.4,1879.92, interface or something like that they had a bunch of adaptations and stuff so that you could play
1879.92,1883.92, versions of half life too and quake and all these other popular games using it you know
1883.92,1889.92, COD and stuff using using the gun device but um their internal software they had was there's
1889.92,1894.48, some interesting stuff there's like basically a complete shameless rip off of catamari democracy
1894.96,1899.84, but again you're moving it in a way instead of moving it with two sticks you're moving it like a ball
1899.84,1903.6, and as you go through and you collect objects and get bigger and bigger you actually feel it
1903.6,1909.28, get heavier in in your hand it was pretty fun it was the biggest kind of carrier this thing has
1909.28,1914.08, is like the foot print like because you got the reason like the weaver modes the wease of
1914.08,1917.84, poppipes because the the remote so like little iPod things you can just lay around on the on the
1917.84,1922.72, that unlike table and the one not up true so they kind of blend in this thing is like
1923.04,1928.64, a robot from space camp or something so it looks like a like a centerfuge for a mid-lab or something
1928.64,1933.76, yeah you have it just that's not that's not around yeah that's my problem with all these things
1933.76,1938.72, this this this vest all the shit that you know what you really want this line around your house I mean
1938.72,1943.2, some of this technology does sound cool but listen you guys describe it I think like well this would
1943.2,1949.44, be cool in in arcade something but not in my house who wants to suit up before playing their PC
1949.44,1958.24, yes well any ever gamer which we look in their gaming vest gaming necktie I will defend though
1958.24,1964.72, that it's not that ridiculous looking the Falcon thing it's it's it's a conversation piece with
1964.72,1971.2, some comes in your version like ah tell the buildings I've heard about this but it's um you can't
1971.2,1976.56, really tell what it is like and to there yeah I don't know I see promising then I think that in
1976.56,1981.6, the future it will be one of the things that like again if Nintendo or someone could do something
1981.6,1986.48, with it because it's great I mean the number is another game right it's this horror game but it can
1986.48,1990.48, simulate in additional weight and stuff it can actually simulate textures like you know where you're
1990.48,1994.6399999999999, running your hand over something and you feel that it's corrugated or you feel that it's slippery
1995.28,2001.44, or sticky um you know it's not just a turning door knobs and stuff but it's actually in the
2001.44,2008.0800000000002, city come on I'm sorry it just the joke was just a cyber it's all the dumbasses of jobes right
2008.8,2017.92, go back to your own things so what what is it huh sticky fingers oh sticky fingers and
2017.92,2022.48, you know okay all right then you and you were glad I thought I was brand I was called you old no I love
2022.48,2026.24, that's what I love it okay no that's what I was on the right that's what I was on the right
2027.2,2032.24, but at the time so it's like you get it no really get it yeah I on the album for a long time before
2032.24,2051.04, I understood that okay okay yeah so I don't know I just think it's in the same way that it's
2051.04,2054.88, fun to use the weeboat and play games with that I think that there's some value in the
2054.88,2061.2799999999997, nehaptic interface and in an ideal world someone will will put out the technology in a way you know
2061.2799999999997,2066.96, either with killer software or it'll be like an Nintendo of the hardware world so that puts it in
2066.96,2071.84, the more people's hands so that it's actually worth someone's time to develop for it but it's hard it's
2071.84,2077.04, due to it's so hard to change and because even when Nintendo has put this device out there how many
2077.04,2081.68, the developers for that system are really really taking advantage of it when they do it's phenomenal
2081.68,2086.48, right and given given their market penetration and you still have now's looking at some of the Wii
2086.48,2091.2, games on the tip Anthony and I went to UB games looking at some of these games like what the
2091.2,2095.44, fuck is someone should like how is this even for the shelf looks like what you said it's
2095.44,2099.84, nascent technology right I mean everyone still does learning how to deal with this right
2099.84,2103.2799999999997, or but not just that people are just shitting out games for the system because they know
2103.28,2107.84, that the install base is high enough that people just buy it I think it's all cheap too yeah
2107.84,2111.2000000000003, there's this one it was like turkey shooter something yeah rooster shoot do you see that
2112.4,2116.4, rooster shoot like imagine like duck hunt if it sucked and it was like turkey there's something
2117.0400000000004,2122.32, imagine duck hunt if it sucked it had graphics like the like when you were describing the graphics
2122.32,2125.84, for you the Cyclops game I was imagining like you know in the mall that's the hospital there's
2125.84,2131.92, someone and on the outside it looks like someone got the mold for like an N64 for like the actual
2131.92,2135.84, plastic hardware but inside it's really like a chip that's like a quarter of an inch square
2135.84,2143.92, in place 28 games it looks like yeah the graphics look like that turkey shoot
2144.7200000000003,2148.88, until some kid goes in the mall and like takes a picture and says it's an intensive power
2148.88,2153.92, letter column and then and then the editors there like quietly pass it along to their legal department
2154.64,2158.08, how much much more do you say this was this is pretty cool
2162.0,2167.36, Nintendo power is no longer at Nintendo though that's true on by future
2168.0,2172.8, indeed it is in the eastern strip of the turn of the window so we saw other stuff there it's
2172.8,2178.48, headed up Brian right just see behind a commando are you looking at me it's your
2178.48,2184.4, tire I did not see by on it commando you were telling me about those sounds pretty cool
2185.2,2189.68, aren't you the one riding the story on it well I haven't he's gonna go see it so
2190.72,2195.28, let's send the one guy who hasn't seen it hey I like the old by on a commando so that's why
2195.28,2201.28, I need to check out you like by a commando so be fun for you Brian and I attended a really great
2201.36,2207.6000000000004, Sid Meyer Q&A and GDC I was riveted yeah you're falling asleep
2208.1600000000003,2210.5600000000004, sarcastic Jeff I actually have fell asleep
2210.5600000000004,2215.84, back I have a picture yeah he has a nice cell phone phone why was it so not riveting it was good I
2215.84,2222.6400000000003, shouldn't disoved let me it was just it was a one on one it was a one on one Q&A with Sid Meyer
2222.6400000000003,2229.52, and his his questioner and he was just like it was a circle like the old days yeah it's just like
2230.16,2236.32, said you're awesome how awesome are you it was like that can okay that's a like 7 8 8 8
2236.32,2243.6, 8 awesome so I'm listening to our podcast for the last week pretty much yeah no it was it was good
2243.6,2249.68, that's tired I did see a good panel with Jack Emer of cryptic studios the former lead on
2249.68,2254.4, on city of heroes was it the one I was up with you the future it was that was a different one the
2254.4,2260.1600000000003, one I was that was just it was just him and he was talking about um episodic content and
2260.1600000000003,2265.52, MMOs and sort of how they released content with city of heroes and sort of you know it was
2265.52,2269.76, surprisingly frank about like a lot of the stuff they got wrong which you know take it with a
2269.76,2273.6800000000003, grain of salt he's working on a new game that directly compete with studio heroes so it's right
2273.6800000000003,2279.36, probably pretty easy for him to admit those things but it was it was interesting and then when we were at
2279.36,2283.76, he was on a panelist with a bunch of other MMO developers and nearly started a war
2284.7200000000003,2288.64, yeah the micro transaction more that was weird that was called the future of MMOs so I was like
2288.64,2295.2000000000003, really excited because Rob Pardo was on there from Blizzard Ray musica from BioWare Jack Emer cryptic
2295.2000000000003,2300.0, so he held and like the guy from website and a guy from MNC stuff so there's like a bunch of you know
2300.0,2305.12, MMO luminaries up there and it panel called the future of MMOs I was totally expecting
2306.08,2310.88, anything but what we got is just the questions were so they were all business focused and that's like
2310.88,2315.28, what really what the game developers conferences and how it's no they can talk about design at the
2315.28,2319.44, game developers conference there's design there's a design track but they were talking more about
2319.44,2324.88, you know whether micro transactions are the way of the future rather than rather than like how
2324.88,2329.28, how story might be playing more into it which is what I was expecting you know
2329.28,2334.96, raid to talk about since they've been touting whatever the MMO is that isn't Star Wars but might be
2335.92,2342.32, it's not co-tor online or is it or is it yeah I don't know but I figured because they were all
2342.32,2346.16, back when we did a Dragon Age story and they were hinting at what it might be they were really talking
2346.16,2351.52, about how narrative and who knows like you know what they learned from Mass Effect might be in there
2351.52,2356.7200000000003, so they expecting that kind of talk and then said it was you know our consoles the future of MMOs
2356.7200000000003,2361.28, that kind of thing but the micro-transact back to the micro-transaction thing what what was the
2361.28,2366.5600000000004, question this was just basically our micro-transactions they were talking about like micro-transactions
2366.5600000000004,2372.8, versus the the uh subscription typical subscription based model and you know some people were arguing
2372.8,2378.0, like you know the Rob Pardo saying it's kind of an east versus west thing you know you see games
2378.0,2383.6800000000003, like maple story that are all completely micro-transaction based and then game you know games like
2383.6800000000003,2388.0, wow city heroes whatever all subscriptions and Jack and right he kind it was kind of like an
2388.0,2392.88, off the cuff comment he he said the like micro-transactions making one of stabs eyes how there's
2392.88,2398.88, something like that yeah and color full remarks at least five times in that regard and of
2398.88,2404.16, course you got the next song guy you know maple story guy yeah they who make their living up that
2404.16,2409.6, like next to him are you just saying every time someone talks about micro-transactions I just want
2409.6,2415.28, to kill them and stuff like that but yeah Jack his um Jack and her it was like you know
2415.28,2420.6400000000003, basically like I don't believe in micro-transactions I think these are stupid and not viable
2420.6400000000003,2425.28, who haven't really seen it implemented over here in this country yet like in a significant way
2425.28,2429.6800000000003, it's against we don't play that well they're with the doll with games for adult but they are trying
2429.6800000000003,2436.88, now I saw two different MMOs for PC uh during the GDC which were both four adults and going to be
2436.88,2442.0, based around like micro-transactions to make their money well were there one was called Requiem
2442.0,2450.0, Bloody Mayor and that one right now can you say that again what Requiem Bloody Mayor was the
2450.0,2454.64, name of it in the whole premise of it was like it is for adults only like when you fight a mob
2454.64,2458.8, you'll like chop off its arm when you're grinding against it and when it falls like it will
2458.8,2464.72, like tie like times collect your arm huh like an entire mob's collective arm no like he means
2464.72,2474.64, I mob is a chance just being a jerk like a he made like a really big point of showing me like
2474.64,2480.08, like a like a centaur that had boobies and because he's like seeing we show the breasts this
2480.08,2485.2, game's clearly not for children I saw that I made a Conan already yeah really but let's see
2485.2,2488.7999999999997, about that but the mix boobies go over but all these the when I talk to them they all said that
2488.7999999999997,2491.9199999999996, they are gonna have micro-transactions but they haven't figured out what they're gonna be yet
2492.56,2498.48, everyone's probably doing some of the 10 to 10 he was you know he's been in a lot of business meetings lately for
2498.48,2504.4, obvious reasons where it sounds like they all the business folks were just like micro-transactions
2504.4,2508.0, I'm sure they're hearing that kind of nonsense I think it's a strike from a player in the
2508.0,2512.56, point of view though I don't really object to it because as long as it's one of the scenarios where
2512.56,2516.8, hey if you want to be the guy who pays money for this stuff you can be that person if you don't
2516.8,2522.0, you don't right because like the whole subscription model thing they give me a break right now like
2522.0,2525.36, it tabular us I got that when it came out and it's like even when I installed it it's like okay
2525.36,2530.0800000000004, well what does it give me 30 days 14 days because that's all there's gonna be yep like no I'm not
2530.0800000000004,2538.32, gonna pay like seriously it was gonna pay 14 95 a month well yeah but for world of workcraft but
2538.32,2542.7200000000003, for multiple games oh yeah well for multiple games I only like you'll do it for world of workcraft
2542.72,2547.7599999999998, because everyone you know is doing it and you're all playing it like always been subscribe to at least
2548.7999999999997,2554.8799999999997, one sometimes that time since like the dawn of MMOs I think you're not excited to subscribe to it
2554.8799999999997,2559.8399999999997, once is too see that I think I think that that's what they're realizing is that the only way
2559.8399999999997,2565.52, they're even gonna get people to try stuff like bloody mayor or whatever is is because is it has to
2565.52,2570.0, change the game it really is a problem though I mean this is like it's like all of these things
2570.0,2575.2, are like a different cable company right like how many cable companies are you gonna subscribe to
2575.2,2581.76, you I mean seriously 15 dollars a month or premium channels right I mean if you can't beat
2582.64,2588.16, you know wow or low-show I don't know and she's soft enough it's five million sales of
2588.16,2595.2, guildwires worldwide yep today but that's not the most recent story yeah yeah that's my
2595.8399999999997,2600.56, yeah and there's no fee to play and then compared it pairs into a type of aros which they recently
2600.56,2605.68, launched and has been called a financial disaster that's having severe repercussions for the company
2605.68,2610.48, uh Korean standing I should also add that the games I saw were also free to download too they were
2610.48,2616.24, completely for if you wanted them to be well so I'm not putting bloody mayor into my uh you are into my
2616.24,2622.72, browser what was what was the other one you said it were too uh I actually can't remember the name of the
2622.7999999999997,2628.24, other one it was pretty forgettable and Gary it's not even on table aros anymore is he he's like
2628.24,2634.8799999999997, off it he's not in spades and now he's like on the space you're speaking about guys he is like
2634.8799999999997,2639.52, you know snake or salesman you know it's like rolls in the town with this new thing it's
2639.52,2644.64, gonna change everything yeah we have a game like whack em all not mine this is gonna be the future
2644.72,2649.2799999999997, em all as well thanks to the money I'm off to another town
2649.2799999999997,2655.2, that's for you not a rail you know it's an angry mob chasing after him hey fucker it is just like
2655.2,2658.16, whack em all
2664.7999999999997,2672.0, so on the topic like so funny I lost my head for ing gdc things yeah just fine because it's not for us
2672.0,2678.72, it's not a press show like it's it's disheartening to me when you see it become a press show
2678.72,2682.56, but even like I went to a post mortem on un-relead tournament three hosted by Jeff Morris and
2683.44,2689.6, the Michael Caps yeah Michael Caps president at epic and uh it was like where am I I mean
2689.6,2694.4, you like theoretically it should be interesting right they okay that what went well where do we succeed
2694.4,2700.64, where do we fail but you look in all around you it's like people holding cell phone cameras and
2700.64,2705.6, cameras up at the screens and the screens are just they're just showing grass slides and
2705.6,2710.08, graphs but then in between they're showing you know what steals from un-relead tournament three
2710.08,2714.96, which has been out now and not only are they just showing still so but they're showing the screen shots
2714.96,2720.48, that have been up all over and everyone's like shoot the cameras just hit the sky like it's a
2720.48,2725.12, Britney Spears concert you know and everyone's like the people are taking cell-farm photos
2725.12,2728.92, of slides of screenshots of the game that's already out.
2728.92,2732.16," And I was like, okay, I was going to be worth a lot."
2732.16,2733.4, I don't wear it.
2733.4,2734.4, Stay at what's happening.
2734.4,2735.48, Is your conference become?
2735.48,2738.7599999999998, How is get that feeling when you see people taking like cell phone photos
2738.7599999999998,2741.04," like out the window if they're playing, you know?"
2741.04,2745.44, Like you're going to get a photo of your camera of your window with glare on it.
2745.44,2746.64, Bravo.
2746.64,2751.16, Sporting of cell phones when we went to register for our press.
2751.16,2752.16," Oh, don't."
2752.16,2753.88," All right, do a head."
2754.04,2756.84," Robert Ashley isn't lying or like, oh shit, it's Robert."
2756.84,2757.48, What's up?
2757.48,2758.2400000000002, Start to talk.

2760.48,2761.56, So I'm talking to Robert.
2761.56,2764.32, I take my place online behind him.
2764.32,2764.84, There's a couple.
2764.84,2766.84, There's another person in front of Jeff.
2766.84,2771.08," Then, you know, one of the people who's citing you and says next,"
2771.08,2773.32," and it was Robert's turn, followed by me."
2773.32,2775.2400000000002," And then Jeff, Jeff runs right up there."

2786.04,2787.04, It did.
2787.04,2790.64," You know, the asshole you're always making fun of in Starbucks like Bobby was"
2790.64,2792.4399999999996," so, man."
2792.4399999999996,2793.4799999999996, I was so that guy.
2793.4799999999996,2798.8399999999997, I was I read like the karma is so bad for me there.
2798.8399999999997,2803.0, Because I'm always bitching at people and lying at pizza about doing that.
2803.0,2806.7599999999998," Just this morning, some dude was on his phone on one of the hands free things."
2806.7599999999998,2808.7599999999998, Still talk and as like the clerk went up.
2808.7599999999998,2811.3599999999997, I was not to tell a story about what you just did.
2812.32,2814.32," Yeah, I'm trying to deflect."
2814.32,2815.32, I was still.
2815.32,2817.28," I was going to say, I'm so full asshole."
2817.28,2822.4, I cut in line in front of two guys and was still talking while cutting.
2822.4,2825.76, And was still talking while they were trying to sign me in.
2825.76,2827.08, Yep.
2827.08,2828.56, That was me.
2828.56,2829.76, And then shot.
2829.76,2833.6," Yeah, I look up and shot and ask you like, what the fuck dude?"
2833.6,2836.92, I don't even matter because we are all just going to like get our badges and go anyway.
2836.92,2838.84, But it was just a person in front of these games.
2838.84,2840.8, It was just like.
2840.88,2842.88, I see man got placed in the be.
2842.88,2843.6400000000003, Right.
2843.6400000000003,2844.44, That's that.
2844.44,2847.44, I apologize to you personally in public now.
2847.44,2848.44, Cutting a funny.
2848.44,2851.84, There was a balloon belong there.
2851.84,2854.7200000000003," I did like Captain Captain, Captain Commando."
2854.7200000000003,2858.6400000000003, That's not to be confused with the other Capcom franchise.
2858.6400000000003,2862.0800000000004, Captain Commando is like the four player sort of beat them up game.
2862.0800000000004,2863.0800000000004, Kind of played like you.
2863.0800000000004,2866.36," He came to me saying that you just played Captain Commando and I was like, what?"
2866.36,2867.36, I got it confused.
2867.44,2869.6, I had played Captain Commando on GameCap.
2869.6,2871.6, That's a long ago.
2871.6,2874.6, And I kind of liked it that you could be in Ninja and there.
2874.6,2876.32, Back to the knife man.
2876.32,2877.84, He was in there too.
2877.84,2879.48, He had bandaged on his face.
2879.48,2880.48, I'm so confused.
2880.48,2882.92, What the hell he's looking about?
2882.92,2883.92, I got it.
2883.92,2885.48, It's not just me.
2885.48,2887.52, It was an old arcade game.
2887.52,2889.28, It wasn't even that old.
2889.28,2892.1600000000003, It was like next gen technology at the time.
2892.1600000000003,2894.6800000000003," But so anyway, the buying of Commando, they have two games."
2895.24,2898.08, They have one that's a remake of the 2D side score or thing.
2898.08,2901.16," But it's like 3D graphics, 2D presentation."
2901.16,2903.3199999999997, And had a really cool look and animation.
2903.3199999999997,2906.04, And the games are all based on the fact that you've got it.
2906.04,2909.52, And taught me farland fashion instead of a gun in this.
2909.52,2913.0, You've got like a grappling hook for an arm.
2913.0,2915.08, You're just able to someone throw something at you.
2915.08,2917.08," You grab it, throw it back at them."
2917.08,2920.52," And the 3D version of the game, which they have this next gen 3D game,"
2920.52,2922.04, kind of acts like Spider-Man.
2922.04,2924.52, So your mobility when you're going through these enormous
2924.52,2927.04," 3D environments, you're able to stick to buildings."
2927.04,2931.32," Or if you see an enemy, you can grab them, throw them up in the air with it"
2931.32,2934.84," and then shoot them, double make a lifestyle, or you could grab them and then pull"
2934.84,2936.92," yourself to him, like a flying kick."
2936.92,2939.52, So you assume the Kung Fu kick.
2939.52,2940.52, You go flying.
2940.52,2942.52," You just like, yes, that's a fun thing."
2942.52,2943.36, How awesome do you?
2943.36,2944.36, I am.
2944.36,2945.8, I'm really playing by any command.
2945.8,2948.64, It's really cool to see emotion where you're just zipping all around.
2948.64,2951.56, And it just looks like it would be pretty fun.
2951.56,2954.7599999999998, And the 2D one looks pretty cool to me too.
2954.7599999999998,2956.7599999999998, So is that 2D one straight up remake?
2956.7599999999998,2957.7599999999998, Or is it all new one?
2957.7599999999998,2958.7599999999998, That I'm not certain.
2958.7599999999998,2959.7599999999998, It's not.
2959.7599999999998,2960.7599999999998," Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
2960.7599999999998,2962.16," And so it's multi platform, but so that I don't get it."
2962.16,2963.16," Yeah, it's a PC."
2963.16,2965.88," And PC is what seems like a weird skew for it, isn't it?"
2965.88,2969.0," Well, they also put lost plan at PC as well."
2969.0,2970.0, I did say skew.
2970.0,2971.0, I'm sorry.
2971.0,2972.0, You did.
2972.0,2973.6, What skills is it going to be on?
2973.6,2974.6, And I didn't think lost plan.
2974.6,2975.6, It was a fun.
2975.6,2976.6, That's a good worst PC.
2976.6,2979.2, It'll make a great force coming to PC.
2979.2,2981.2, That doesn't seem like a very good PC game either.
2981.96,2983.96, I should play it with a controller for it.
2983.96,2984.56, Yeah.
2984.56,2988.68, You know what was actually good on the PC was Resident Evil 4 though?
2988.68,2990.4399999999996," That played well, I thought."
2990.4399999999996,2992.8399999999997," Yeah, I think because you have to."
2992.8399999999997,2995.4399999999996, I don't think you could use the mouse to aim.
2995.4399999999996,2996.4399999999996," Yeah, I think."
2996.4399999999996,2997.4399999999996, Really?
2997.4399999999996,2998.4399999999996, That.
2998.4399999999996,2999.4399999999996, I was playing the console.
2999.4399999999996,3000.8399999999997, I've been getting nostalgia for that game.
3000.8399999999997,3003.24, So I just borrowed the wee version from Anthony.
3003.24,3004.64, Are you trying it?
3004.64,3005.64, Is it good?
3005.64,3006.64, I was about to.
3006.64,3007.64, I got it.
3007.64,3008.64," No, it's a good."
3008.64,3012.6," On the GameCube ones, you just kind of aimed at the guy and you hit him where you hit him."
3012.6,3015.24," Where's this one, the wee mode controls exactly where you're going."
3015.24,3016.24, Same thing.
3016.24,3018.44, So you can aim for like a knee and drop them really easily.
3018.44,3019.8799999999997, It seemed really cool to me.
3019.8799999999997,3021.2799999999997, So it does work really well.
3021.2799999999997,3024.48," It's a good excuse because I wanted to play it again, but I don't want to just, well,"
3024.48,3028.16, my incentive to play it again on the game could be that I can I unlock some super
3028.16,3029.48, weapon or something.
3029.48,3030.48, I hope there's a code.
3030.48,3031.8399999999997, That's the first thing I'm doing when I go home.
3031.8399999999997,3034.2, I'm going to go online and I'm looking at my cheats.
3034.2,3036.6, I'm going to see if there's just some code I can put in.
3036.6,3039.6," I'm not expecting to find it because they're going to wee, well, you got to beat it"
3039.6,3041.6," in order to get like, yeah, that's the third design."
3041.6,3043.7999999999997," It's all in the laser, but that's stupid."
3043.7999999999997,3046.2, It's like I've already beat the game the right way.
3046.2,3047.2, Capcom always does it that way.
3047.2,3051.0, Let me put in the fucking code and get a laser and go in there with the wee mode and cut
3051.0,3052.0, people up with it.
3052.0,3053.0, Hit the zombies.
3053.0,3054.0, They're not zombies.
3054.0,3055.0, What do they call?
3055.0,3056.0, There's zombies.
3056.0,3059.0," Now, what's what is their name, Logan?"
3059.0,3060.0, They're not zombies.
3060.0,3061.0, They're on their own.
3061.0,3062.0, They're on their own.
3062.0,3063.0, They're on their own.
3063.0,3064.0, They're Spanish.
3064.0,3065.0, That's the whole thing.
3065.0,3066.0, It was supposed to.
3066.0,3068.4, There's a bunch of listeners right now yelling at you.
3068.4,3069.4," Yeah, they were on over."
3069.4,3071.2, We're a PC podcast.
3071.2,3072.2, Fuck you.
3072.2,3074.6, We don't know the name of the official name of it.
3074.6,3075.6, Fuck you.
3075.6,3076.6, I didn't have time.
3076.6,3077.6, We just had the die.
3077.6,3078.6, I just learned again.
3078.6,3079.6, Shoot their head.
3079.6,3080.6, He died.
3080.6,3083.6," Actually, some people would consider that spoiler."
3083.6,3085.6," Some of them, you don't shoot them in the head."
3085.6,3086.6, You don't.
3086.6,3089.6," Well, if you do, you got to be ready for something else to happen."
3089.6,3092.6, How is all the ones that then the technical shit comes in?
3092.6,3093.6, Hey.
3093.6,3094.6, Is that a spoiler?
3095.2,3097.2, There are 10 olds.
3097.2,3099.2, The gas went out for a long time.
3099.2,3100.2," Yeah, come way in there."
3100.2,3102.6, The spoiler is more like we found out in loss that Cates
3102.6,3104.2, been taking care of baby Aaron.
3104.2,3105.0, A way to go.
3105.0,3106.0," Oh, man."
3106.0,3107.2, Thanks.
3107.2,3109.2, I just wanted to put that all over.
3111.2,3112.6," Oh, I'm sad."
3114.7999999999997,3117.6, Now we got to put spoiler on the front of the whole tech.
3117.6,3118.0, Talking.
3118.0,3119.0, What else did you get to see?
3119.0,3120.2, Who's here about it?
3120.2,3121.2," Oh, what did I do?"
3121.7999999999997,3129.2," On the last day of GDC, we had a big reunion here at the office"
3129.2,3130.6, for all the LucasArts.
3130.6,3132.2, That sounded wonderful.
3132.2,3135.3999999999996, We had Matt Leon.
3135.3999999999996,3143.0," One up to executive editor and we got to Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman,"
3143.0,3146.3999999999996," Noah Falsene, Kersen Monkey Island's Larry A. Hurren,"
3146.3999999999996,3149.6, and a bunch of other dudes.
3149.6,3154.2, I'm not sure who they really are.
3154.2,3155.6," I mean, they're not designers or anything."
3155.6,3158.68," They were more on the R side, but they were"
3158.68,3160.6, LucasArts employees back during that interview.
3160.6,3161.6, It was on.
3161.6,3163.0," Oh, you know."
3163.0,3165.6," But um, he got a groupies."
3165.6,3170.6," But they, uh, we kind of, you know, hit record and let him talk."
3170.6,3171.0, Cool.
3171.0,3172.2, I bet that was funny.
3172.2,3174.2, So did the podcast work where it was.
3174.2,3175.2, It was fun.
3175.2,3175.6, It was filmed.
3175.6,3176.2, OK.
3176.2,3177.4, It has been on yet.
3177.4,3178.6, It has not.
3178.6,3180.7999999999997, We recorded like an hour and a half of footage.
3180.7999999999997,3182.4, I believe it's going to be edited into a number of
3182.4,3183.4, to 10 seconds.
3183.4,3184.4," Oh, well."
3184.4,3186.2," But uh, it was really cool."
3186.2,3187.0, That's exciting.
3187.0,3188.0, Yeah.
3188.0,3192.2," Unfortunately, you know, we couldn't get like Tim Schaffer."
3192.2,3193.6, Ron Gilbert's pretty good.
3193.6,3194.2, Yeah.
3194.2,3195.6," Well, all those guys are really good."
3195.6,3198.7999999999997," But there were, there were a few of them that we met."
3198.7999999999997,3201.2, So give us a highlight.
3201.2,3204.2," Um, a choice quote."
3204.2,3207.0," Well, we, we asked them."
3207.0,3209.0," One of the things I asked them was, you know, back,"
3209.0,3212.0," that that time, you know, because ours was obviously, you know,"
3212.0,3215.0, in the end of the stars or there were no stars or
3215.0,3216.0, it had been to games.
3216.0,3219.0," And I guess they had a, they had scrapped a Boba Fett"
3219.0,3223.0, adventure game idea at one point and a C3PO adventure game.
3223.0,3224.0, Wow.
3224.0,3226.0, So it wasn't they never had any
3226.0,3227.0, introductions.
3227.0,3228.0, I was a player either of those.
3228.0,3229.0, Yeah.
3229.0,3231.0, But so I played workcraft adventures.
3231.0,3232.0, I do.
3232.0,3233.0, Me too.
3233.0,3236.0, Who wouldn't play a Boba Fett thing or C3PO adventure?
3236.0,3238.0, Probably wouldn't have to have a choice.
3238.0,3239.0, Yeah.
3239.0,3240.0, To the new children's going to get one.
3240.0,3244.0," Well, no, back then back then it would have of course."
3244.0,3247.0, It's had their concern back then was like C2PO wasn't popular enough.
3247.0,3248.0," Well, he had his own."
3248.0,3249.0, Serial.
3249.0,3251.0, Did you just put it in every ethos?
3251.0,3253.0, That's how I got to be six with three.
3253.0,3257.0, I would have put something good in that.
3257.0,3260.0, I'm horrified for gross.
3260.0,3263.0," And that's why you have that kind of, if it's an accent too."
3263.0,3264.0, I had a car.
3264.0,3266.0," Like the one that makes me say,"
3266.0,3268.0, Grandma's Grandma's by-tapter.
3268.0,3270.0," By-tapter, let's just wait to start"
3270.0,3272.0, to find the Grimmino putter.
3272.0,3275.0, Is that really the jam?
3275.0,3278.0, I like the shame version of old jingles.
3278.0,3280.0," Like, you know what, yes, with like random video game"
3280.0,3281.0, back to it.
3281.0,3282.0, Yeah.
3282.0,3284.0, I could do that with like everything from like fruit
3284.0,3286.0, dial and cereal or yama yama.
3286.0,3290.0," Now, your cooking is different than moms and it's more fun too."
3290.0,3291.0, You do crispy critters.
3291.0,3292.0, Crispy critters.
3292.0,3293.0, How do you get to?
3293.0,3295.0, Crispy critters.
3295.0,3297.0," Seriously, y'all's entirely new."
3297.0,3298.0, They sent you with a bleed?
3298.0,3300.0, And do with a bleed.
3300.0,3303.0," I could do that, but they go back to the seven."
3303.0,3307.0, Mr. T. He's got a fistful of rings and a mean mean looking
3307.0,3308.0, is that.
3308.0,3313.0, Mr. T. He's got a real cool haircut and he's 12.
3313.0,3314.0, Inches high.
3314.0,3317.0," So, got loop."
3317.0,3320.0, There's like gaps because that was just like with an area
3320.0,3322.0, when I was a latch key kid.
3322.0,3324.0, You're supposed to that kind of crap.
3324.0,3327.0, There's a weird thing in our brains that
3327.0,3329.0, retains those jingles.
3329.0,3330.0, I don't know what it is.
3330.0,3331.0, I think it's particularly American.
3331.0,3332.0, They were affected by this.
3332.0,3334.0, It's called by my ability.
3334.0,3335.0, They've done their job.
3335.0,3336.0, They're called this shit.
3336.0,3338.0, They're tailored to be remembered.
3338.0,3341.0," Yeah, I can't remember where my keys are or whatever that."
3341.0,3343.0, But I can do like the blue bonnet.
3343.0,3344.0, Yeah.
3344.0,3346.0, Marjorin commercial from 1973.
3346.0,3348.0, Everything's better with blue bonnet on it.
3348.0,3349.0," Say,"
3349.0,3350.0, Where's the rest of?
3350.0,3351.0, I want some like.
3352.0,3354.0, I want a.
3354.0,3356.0, Teen steam got a letter.
3356.0,3361.0, This will be a separate podcast.
3361.0,3363.0," Yeah, well, just keep my glasses."
3363.0,3365.0, It's just jingles on nice and jingles.
3365.0,3366.0," Yeah, battle royale."
3366.0,3368.0, But then there was the best ones were like.
3368.0,3369.0," Mr. Bucket, the boss."
3369.0,3371.0," Madam, Madam. Mr. Bucket."
3371.0,3373.0, It's just like given at the time.
3373.0,3374.0, What?
3374.0,3376.0, Why did they gotta do that?
3376.0,3380.0, Bucket's a fun.
3380.0,3385.0, What else do we get?
3385.0,3387.0, Anything.
3387.0,3392.0, We should say where we're still like just recovering from post shall burn right.
3392.0,3393.0, I'll be ready.
3393.0,3395.0, If this podcast seems a bit scattered.
3395.0,3397.0, I'm playing front lines.
3397.0,3398.0, Came out front lines.
3398.0,3399.0, Fuel war came out today.
3399.0,3401.0, I'm playing that for review.
3401.0,3402.0, I saw you playing it already.
3402.0,3403.0, Yeah.
3403.0,3404.0, I'll more to say on it next week.
3404.0,3407.0, Maybe Anthony you'll you'll get your copy.
3407.0,3408.0, You'll play with me.
3409.0,3412.0, I got utterly obsessed with Civ 4 this weekend.
3412.0,3414.0, So I wanted to bring that up.
3414.0,3415.0, Okay.
3415.0,3417.0, I know I'm bringing it up.
3417.0,3424.0," Because my brain, the thinking went from I got back into sport after you and I saw it at that event."
3424.0,3427.0, And I just got re-excited for that game.
3427.0,3432.0, And I was thinking about Soren Johnson who had moved from for access to that to
3432.0,3434.0, Max's tour con sport.
3434.0,3441.0, And I thought it was interesting that this guy has gone from working on Sid Myers civilization
3441.0,3444.0, to working on Will Wright's sport.
3444.0,3448.0, Really he actually wasly designer at Civ 4.
3448.0,3450.0, I'm not sure what kind of input Sid had.
3450.0,3451.0, I'm sure he had some.
3451.0,3454.0, But really with Soren's game more than anyone else's.
3454.0,3457.0, So just thinking about Soren Johnson made me put that up.
3457.0,3460.0, And you know I don't know if you guys hear of played Civ 4.
3460.0,3462.0, But or if a previous is probably.
3462.0,3466.0, Like my obsession with Civ was the original one.
3466.0,3468.0," And that game, it just."
3468.0,3471.0, You need to commit to it if you're really going to do it.
3471.0,3475.0, You know you cannot be a Civ dabler because the games are just so long.
3475.0,3477.0, I mean it's like some of the solar empire now.
3477.0,3479.0, Except it's turn based on it's even slower.
3479.0,3486.0," So you know working in this job, I never really take the opportunity to just totally indulge in a game like that."
3486.0,3488.0, Have you ever finished a game of Civ?
3488.0,3489.0, A multiplayer game?
3489.0,3490.0, Yeah.
3490.0,3491.0, Multiplayer now.
3491.0,3492.0, Yeah.
3492.0,3495.0," We try like those kind of games multiplayer, but it's never."
3495.0,3496.0, We never ever.
3496.0,3497.0, Yeah.
3497.0,3500.0, They're really two sessions max and then you're done.
3500.0,3501.0, Yeah.
3501.0,3502.0, Because the mostly it's just commuting.
3502.0,3505.0," Yeah, just waiting for everybody else to take their turn."
3505.0,3509.0," But this Saturday after GDC, I was so wiped out."
3509.0,3512.0," You know, and I was so tired."
3512.0,3513.0, I couldn't even read.
3513.0,3514.0, I didn't want to do anything.
3514.0,3518.0, And I told my family just like I need to I seriously need to vet
3519.0,3522.0," out in front of a game and just, you know, forgive me."
3522.0,3524.0," I miss you too, but I'll see you tomorrow."
3524.0,3526.0, I need a day on my own.
3526.0,3531.0," I swear that you chose to match out with Civ 4, which is like really dense."
3531.0,3536.0," It is, but I wanted, I really wanted to get lost in something really dense."
3536.0,3539.0," You know, I'd sort of like picking up a big historical novel or something."
3539.0,3543.0," You know, just and I just, I knew I was going to spend hours on it."
3543.0,3547.0, So I felt like if ever that was a day where I was going to finally get to give this game the time.
3547.0,3549.0, It needed it was today.
3549.0,3553.0, And so I played it from about 11 a.m. until 2.30 in the morning.
3553.0,3558.0, And I got up for the necessary bathroom breaks and food.
3558.0,3562.0, And to say hi to the people I live with once in a while.
3562.0,3565.0, And it was so fucking good.
3565.0,3568.0, It was so good to do that for one.
3568.0,3570.0, I probably never do it again.
3570.0,3574.0," You're for, there'll be many years again since I get a day like that."
3574.0,3581.0," But, but the game, it just reminded me, you know, how how brilliant the game design is and that thing."
3581.0,3587.0, It's a very similar to a sense of a solar empire in that there's so much to do.
3587.0,3589.0, There's so many goals.
3589.0,3594.0, Anyone turned there's so much to accomplish that it just seems like it could break so easily.
3594.0,3599.0," Like this should not be a game that functions because it's just, it's too unwieldy."
3599.0,3603.0," You're trying to conquer the world from 4,400 BC until the future."
3603.0,3606.0," You know, and there's just no way that that should really work."
3606.0,3608.0, And it's just so brilliant design.
3608.0,3611.0," It always has been back to 7,1 in 1991."
3611.0,3614.0," But, before,"
3614.0,3617.0," Severe seemed particularly great to me because,"
3617.0,3621.0, because they've made the concessions to the way it looks now in terms of its graphics.
3621.0,3625.0, They've streamlined a lot of the stuff that used to be much more tedious.
3625.0,3631.0, It's kind of the same way that like PC game receives to be able to deal with editing their auto-exact
3631.0,3637.0," that bad file and configs this and now everything's, you know, like we put up with more back then."
3637.0,3638.0, Yeah.
3638.0,3643.0," And in Sioux, 4 now they've gotten rid of some of the intense micromanaging that I think this wouldn't fly now."
3643.0,3647.0, So you really can go in and just play it on a certain level if you want.
3647.0,3650.0, I'm just going to build cities and I'm going to conquer that country over there.
3650.0,3657.0," And you don't have to worry about, you know, putting workers on certain tiles and things like that for the city management."
3657.0,3659.0," But if you want to, you can."
3659.0,3662.0, That's where the older ones broke for me is like in the late game.
3662.0,3663.0, Yeah.
3663.0,3667.0, You are reaching more and more modern era and things are starting to get interesting technologically.
3667.0,3669.0, That's when one turn took forever.
3669.0,3670.0, Yeah.
3670.0,3674.0, Just because you had to go to all the different places you've conquered and my command to draw that stuff.
3674.0,3675.0, And that's where I love the interest.
3675.0,3677.0, And I usually played like two thirds of a game.
3677.0,3678.0," Even if I was winning,"
3678.0,3679.0, Yeah.
3679.0,3685.0, I would then start a new one instead of finishing off the one I was on because the late play games for those were just so overwhelming to me.
3685.0,3687.0, And I think that's not entirely gone.
3687.0,3690.0, I know there was at least one game where I did that.
3690.0,3693.0," Like I was like 70, I could see I was going to win."
3693.0,3698.0," And yeah, every turn is so long that I was like, okay, well, I won."
3698.0,3700.0, I'm going to say I won.
3700.0,3701.0, Mm-hmm.
3701.0,3705.0, I was going to give yourself some hot cocoa and coffee.
3705.0,3710.0," I was waiting to make a comment on there and I was like, this would be the perfect point to transition."
3710.0,3713.0, But then like you kept going and then you ended on that note.
3713.0,3723.0," I was actually going to say that it reminds me of like well another reason to celebrate, you know, PC is a gaming platform until you get to the point where you turn stays so long you just pretend you win."
3723.0,3730.0," Well, it's like, it's one reason why last week was so frustrating to me, not just because of like, you know, coming out of the convention."
3730.0,3731.0," Yeah, the conference."
3731.0,3734.0, There was just so much doom and gloom PC talk.
3734.0,3735.0, Mm-hmm.
3735.0,3742.0," And I think that in the middle of all, you know, the punitri and the, you know, the point making and just try, you know,"
3742.0,3746.0," as far as the podcasting goes and stuff, you know, trying to score points with online listeners and stuff."
3746.0,3750.0, The whole talk is just like PC is hard to manage.
3750.0,3751.0, It's too hard to change.
3751.0,3752.0, This is a caught up here.
3752.0,3753.0, So you want up your share.
3753.0,3759.0," And also, but in the larger extent of just the show when you had no cliffy bees comments."
3759.0,3760.0, Yeah.
3760.0,3766.0," And, you know, a few other people may comments to the extent that they were losing faith in the platform and this net."
3766.0,3769.0, But I think the majority of the discussion is all about.
3770.0,3775.0, People that didn't play PC games and at least I want to be honest people don't play PC games in the first place.
3775.0,3777.0, Or you talk about how difficult they are.
3777.0,3780.0," You know, how difficult the hardware is to work with."
3780.0,3786.0," How I mean all of these problems that are, to, to a great extent, I think they're blowing them out of proportion."
3786.0,3790.0," But ultimately, it was really the discussion was just about the business side of things."
3790.0,3798.0," And like, what, this is what was disturbing to me is just like the love for the, the huge heritage on of PC games and the type of games that only,"
3798.0,3804.0," that come out and only would have come out, you know, if not for the platform and all these other aspects of it."
3804.0,3806.0," And the reasons why we do it, we do it, we do it, we love it."
3806.0,3812.0," Like that all just gets lost in the middle of like trying to be the first to, to bang to say, I called it, it's dead."
3812.0,3813.0," I called it, you know, right?"
3813.0,3815.0," And anytime it's that bell button, wrong amount."
3815.0,3826.0," And it's been running a million times and it was funny because like even, you know, like Mark Raine went out to spook up to contradict cliffy bee and say that he's just basically a console developer and he's been one for ages."
3826.0,3840.0," And, you know, he's missing, you know, the point even some of our guests, you know, Chris Perry was talking about how he helps to make more money with a 360 version of Supreme Commander and it was like, it's not my mind at the time, but get a point it out that like, you know,"
3840.0,3850.0," this is a command and conquer three sold allegedly sold, you know, according to MPD numbers, like a 1.7 million copies on PC and a mere, you know, 300 and something thousand on the console."
3850.0,3856.0," So it's like, well, we could have asked, you know, Chris, like, well, do you think that Supreme Commander's going to be any different?"
3856.0,3868.0," You think it's been, I mean, I mean, there's just so many factors involved and stuff and I mean, I don't know, not to get into too much just to say that I mean it's good to hear, you know, when you guys are even though like I particularly, we haven't played that game."
3868.0,3872.0," I think it sounds like something I should. I mean, it's good to see like the experience you're describing is definitely unique."
3872.0,3885.0," It's a fucking brilliant game. It is. I mean, you know, that my comment about quitting at the end, it's only because I, we're talking about like hours and hours, right, in which I was utterly gripped at my computer."
3885.0,3896.0," And I just saw the way the tide was, it was a tradition at this point in my game. I mean, I'm not being defensive now, just saying, if you, if you played the game, you would know at a certain point, you're, you're basically just grinding out an end game."
3896.0,3916.0," And many games worked that way, right, chess works that way. But certainly there's plenty of games of silver. It does turn out, you know, bad for you way in the late game. I mean, it stays challenging, especially this is a game where the AI is so scalable, you know, you could start out at which is essentially like a sandbox level to learn the game."
3916.0,3932.0," And once you start ramping it up, this thing will completely kick your ass. And that's what I love about the game so much is that to me, I realized this weekend after like almost a decade or more of really not, you know, I used to love, and then I just, you know, you get busy with everything else."
3932.0,3945.0," But I think after this weekend, and it feels, it's probably just a gut reaction. I would change it in a week, but like right now, I feel like, because I get asked this question all the time that this would be my, my desert island game because there's so much to do with soon as you ramp,"
3945.0,3951.0," as soon as you not, notch up that AI one more notch and there's a bunch, I forget like 12 levels of difficulty."
3951.0,3959.0," All the sudden, every strategy you thought you had to beat the AI once you think you have it figured out and, oh, well, this is just an algorithm."
3959.0,3972.0," I can, I can work around because my brain is smarter than the computers. All the sudden your whole game is, is out the window again, and you have to rethink it all again. So, you know, and it's not to say, like, you know,"
3972.0,3988.0," so yes, it's, it's, it's very hard on, on, if you want it to be, but you could scale it down to where anybody who's not even a PC gamer could go in there and find, I think, find like total join this game on the most basic level."
3988.0,3994.0," So, and then it is a unique PC experience. Very much. And I'm probably to Santa like the old guy."
3994.0,3996.0," Hey, you know, turn-based games."
3996.0,4002.0, True. Other now playing stuff.
4002.0,4004.0, And you guys playing audio surf?
4004.0,4010.0," Yes. Good game. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that, oh my god."
4010.0,4014.0," Now you did not play it, but I'm talking about it."
4014.0,4016.0, It's pretty awesome. Why is it off?
4016.0,4018.0, Thanks Ryan.
4018.0,4021.0, What makes it awesome? It is a synesthesia.
4021.0,4025.0," Well, it's sort of for people who don't know what audio surf is."
4025.0,4030.0," It's kind of like a guitar hero-ish thing. I mean, I guess I can't compare it."
4030.0,4033.0," It's sort, it's like your hidden colored buttons to music."
4033.0,4035.0, It looks like a guitar hero.
4035.0,4037.0, It's more like the jeweled meats.
4037.0,4040.0," I mean, it's a match three, right?"
4040.0,4045.0," I mean, if there's a mode where you can play it that way, you don't have to."
4045.0,4047.0, There's so much you do if you know what this is.
4047.0,4048.0, I played it.
4048.0,4049.0, Now I played it.
4049.0,4051.0, Listen to the quality analysis.
4051.0,4052.0," Oh, gee."
4052.0,4053.0, Damn.
4053.0,4055.0, That's fucking hurts.
4055.0,4058.0, I get the discussion to see.
4058.0,4060.0, What is it?
4060.0,4062.0, It's great.
4062.0,4065.0, It's like that's the most mickey life review.
4065.0,4072.0," So you move, like this little ship, what have you along this track,"
4072.0,4077.0, which there are like three or four different lanes where there's
4077.0,4080.0, a different color blocks that you'll run over.
4080.0,4087.0," And you have, at the very bottom of the screen, you have this grid where you have to match three"
4087.0,4089.0, colors in any one column.
4089.0,4093.0," Three or more of the same color, because all the different breaks you run an over, you know, red, blue,"
4093.0,4094.0, whatever.
4094.0,4099.0," And when you match three touching blocks, it'll clear out and give you points."
4099.0,4100.0, And so the other side.
4100.0,4101.0," Yeah, innovative that is."
4101.0,4103.0, You match the three color things together.
4103.0,4104.0, That's the track on July.
4104.0,4108.0, And they clear time with the music with the tempo and the beat of the music that you got.
4108.0,4113.0," And then also the blocks come in time with like certain tones, like, you know,"
4113.0,4115.0, snares and symbols and things like that.
4115.0,4116.0, Right.
4116.0,4117.0," That's really the unique aspect of it, right?"
4117.0,4120.0, And you can use any music you want with it.
4120.0,4122.0," Which is very, you're including what's your name?"
4122.0,4124.0," YouTube here, Mandy Moore."
4124.0,4125.0, No.
4125.0,4126.0, What's up?
4126.0,4128.0," Oh, well, Jeff's favorite singer."
4128.0,4129.0, Yeah.
4129.0,4131.0," That one that you were sending me, those horrible links."
4131.0,4134.0," And then, Jen, some kid, down, down, down, go."
4134.0,4135.0," Yeah, down, go."
4135.0,4136.0," Yeah, down, go."
4136.0,4142.0," That's part of the fun for me about your service, just like uploading your scoring, seeing if anyone else has raised that track."
4142.0,4146.0," And so far, I was like, no, not my normal snuffer do either."
4146.0,4152.0," I found that if you want to get a high score, and you want to have an easy time playing, put on reggae."
4152.0,4153.0, Yeah.
4153.0,4154.0, Yeah.
4154.0,4158.0," Because, you know, it goes the thing, the speed of the thing, go on speed of the music."
4158.0,4159.0, I was actually going to recommend.
4159.0,4163.0, I've had the most fun with tracks that have like a wide variety of tempos.
4163.0,4171.0," And so then you could feel, I mean, the tracks slowing down and speeding up, the audio track and that physical track and the game that you're racing along."
4171.0,4180.0," So that you get that, you know, stintesthesia experience to the better extent when, you know, you're, you're consciously aware of like,"
4180.0,4186.0, I was really getting the stintesthesia effect with craft work because they have that.
4186.0,4187.0, Yeah.
4187.0,4188.0, Craft of act.
4188.0,4198.0," Vy-dance file not because they, you know, because you do have the steady rhythmic hypnotic beat, but they're constantly adding on different instruments with getting represented that way."
4198.0,4199.0, So game.
4199.0,4202.0, Does one representation of the music is cool?
4202.0,4203.0, Yeah.
4203.0,4207.0," If you play one song, if you put, could you put any MP3 you own in there, right?"
4207.0,4208.0, Right.
4208.0,4210.0," So if you play it one time, it will be identical."
4210.0,4214.0," The next time, or is there some element of randomization, like every time you'll be play a song."
4214.0,4215.0, It's the same.
4215.0,4216.0, Depends on the mode.
4216.0,4217.0, Yeah.
4217.0,4219.0, You can change the mode for game modes.
4219.0,4220.0, Right.
4220.0,4228.0," There's a mode where you, there's a just colored blocks and then brick walls, your special avoid the brick walls and hit all the colored blocks."
4228.0,4235.0," It is a really neat function that as soon as you're done, you can upload your score immediately and see who else has played that song."
4235.0,4236.0, The easy.
4236.0,4241.0, The other thing about that is like bad ID three tags kill.
4241.0,4243.0," Oh, because they're so many versions."
4243.0,4256.0," You know, I mean, like whenever I just had a hand when to play whatever song, I'll go and search high scores to see what the correct name of the song is that people have been playing."
4256.0,4257.0," Oh, yeah."
4257.0,4259.0," So what songs have you done, Ryan?"
4259.0,4260.0, I'm curious.
4260.0,4263.0," I did the portal song, which I'm sure everybody did."
4263.0,4264.0, Right.
4264.0,4267.0, Which comes right there in the anything from Final Fantasy?
4267.0,4268.0, No.
4268.0,4270.0," I did, uh, what did I do?"
4270.0,4272.0, I did the back of the future with team song.
4272.0,4275.0, Is that the guy to get back into?
4275.0,4277.0," No, no, no, like that."
4277.0,4279.0, It's the instrumental.
4279.0,4282.0, Not that song.
4282.0,4283.0, Damn it.
4283.0,4285.0, I do anything from the top going soundtrack.
4285.0,4286.0, No.
4286.0,4290.0," I did, uh, I didn't in the name song."
4290.0,4295.0," It's a rather one if you're a very steady, you know."
4295.0,4297.0, Very easy.
4298.0,4300.0, You can't listen to the right rap.
4300.0,4303.0, Page just bow to worms got all kinds of mix up in it.
4303.0,4305.0," That's, I've been, I've had racing that one."
4305.0,4306.0, It's good.
4306.0,4307.0, Okay.
4307.0,4308.0, It's fun.
4308.0,4314.0," I had a friend, a little tangent, who would play Star Fox for the SNES."
4314.0,4318.0, But he would turn the volume all the way down and then put rocksets.
4318.0,4320.0, The look on repeat the whole time.
4320.0,4321.0," Oh, shit."
4321.0,4323.0, That's why he could play it really.
4323.0,4326.0," And as he was playing, and he was like, just buttering out."
4326.0,4329.0," He's like, no, no, no, no."
4329.0,4331.0, That's even to the beat as he plays Star Fox.
4331.0,4335.0, So is that sort of like sinking up dark side of the moon and was sort of lost for it?
4335.0,4337.0," That's, that's my only guess."
4337.0,4340.0," Certain lyrics were, was transcendental for him."
4340.0,4341.0, Were working certain times.
4341.0,4342.0, Was he like autistic?
4342.0,4343.0, It's a turn.
4343.0,4345.0, For an acre man.
4345.0,4348.0," Maybe he was like, my, uh, I hit, when my wife and I lived in the"
4348.0,4354.0," South up in the Berkeley Hills are, are landlord lived below us in the same house."
4354.0,4359.0," And he used to be down there and in the middle of the night, he would, uh,"
4359.0,4365.0, He would be with his girlfriend down there and they would have loud sex to
4365.0,4370.0," Madonna's Papa don't preach with what, which was on repeat."
4370.0,4372.0, Like what a fucked up song to be.
4372.0,4374.0, I'm keeping my baby.
4374.0,4377.0, And it was our landlord too.
4377.0,4379.0, So like we couldn't exactly complain.
4379.0,4380.0, Dude.
4380.0,4383.0," Yeah, that's why we don't want to go there."
4383.0,4386.0, But sex to music with lyrics can be a bad thing.
4386.0,4388.0, That was just like pay attention.
4388.0,4389.0," And like that, you're like, oh shit."
4389.0,4391.0, I don't want to get that associated.
4391.0,4395.0," Yeah, today I can't hear that song to this day or my friend, my landlord."
4395.0,4398.0," Oh, oh, listen to the same thing over and over again."
4398.0,4401.0," Or money of my friend Corey, he had, he had this old brother."
4401.0,4406.0," And he's like, wasn't this room listening to radiohead's fake plastic trees."
4406.0,4408.0, Like over and over again for like three days.
4408.0,4411.0," And then, uh, like that it was just all day long."
4411.0,4412.0, That's a little track.
4412.0,4415.0," He had like, you know, all of the bands or whatever weren't playing anything else."
4415.0,4422.0," And then, uh, and then, um, the same guy though, like months later, he had sort of like a schizophrenic episode."
4422.0,4426.0, And that was the first thing to mark the onset of total full blown schizophrenia.
4426.0,4429.0, But his first thing was that God spoke to him.
4429.0,4432.0," And he, like, we found the sound because he came up to Corey and he was like,"
4432.0,4434.0," Come on, he was like, you know, God talked to me."
4434.0,4435.0," And we're like, what did he tell you dude?"
4435.0,4438.0," He said, he doesn't want you to smoke pot anymore."
4438.0,4441.0," Corey, we're like, oh, shit."
4441.0,4444.0," He broke the 2000, you could've sent on the telechoried."
4444.0,4448.0, I better lay out the reverted.
4448.0,4449.0, Yeah.
4449.0,4451.0, Seriously.
4451.0,4456.0, It was for some important like that.
4456.0,4458.0, Had we get there.
4458.0,4459.0, On the turf.
4459.0,4460.0, On the audio surf.
4460.0,4463.0," We turned it to like, so Vont surf."
4463.0,4466.0," Well, we can bring it back to the PC."
4467.0,4472.0," Um, in general, despite saying how well that game has been selling,"
4472.0,4476.0," I mean, talking about body from valve saying that it's like their number one"
4476.0,4478.0, Steam's number one selling.
4478.0,4479.0, So far.
4479.0,4480.0, How much is it 10 bucks?
4480.0,4481.0, 10 bucks.
4481.0,4482.0, 10 bucks.
4482.0,4486.0, There were big crowds of GDC around it at the independent games area.
4486.0,4488.0, They had audio surf running.
4488.0,4489.0, They had more games.
4489.0,4493.0," I love more games that employ, you know, music somewhere and other."
4493.0,4500.0, I started trying to pop up on because Eric Wopah from valve portal writer was recommending to us.
4500.0,4503.0, And I've only gotten so far into it that I can just go around going.
4503.0,4504.0, Pop up on.
4504.0,4505.0, I've done like a lot of things.
4505.0,4507.0, It's like a cult with this game.
4507.0,4510.0, Everybody who has this game does this because it's a skip.
4510.0,4511.0, Let's do that with all things.
4511.0,4512.0, It's just though.
4512.0,4513.0, And that's really what it is.
4513.0,4519.0, Basically imagine if you had a side scrolling game and you had a little army.
4519.0,4526.0," And rather than telling, you know, whatever rather than telling them, you know, attack or move forward or run or defend."
4526.0,4531.0, You basically take a button and string it out so that it's like four buttons.
4531.0,4535.0," So for example, it would be like square circle square a square."
4535.0,4537.0, And then that makes us like pat that poem.
4537.0,4542.0," This is like sort of, you know, on a mod of P for drum sounds and Japanese or something."
4542.0,4544.0," So it'll be like, p on pat that poem."
4544.0,4546.0, And then your guys will attack.
4546.0,4548.0, And then if you want them to run forward.
4548.0,4549.0," I thought, pat that poem."
4549.0,4550.0, Okay.
4550.0,4555.0," And then so when you when you look at it this way, it's like, it's really ridiculous because you're taking basically a binary."
4555.0,4559.0, These really simple commands attack or or move forward.
4559.0,4563.0," And you're assigning them to this sort of, you know, convoluted rhythmic input."
4563.0,4566.0, But the fun is this is in the colon response that you do it.
4566.0,4569.0, And in their wee little distorted Japanese voices.
4569.0,4573.0, The characters will respond to whatever drum call you had.
4573.0,4575.0, And they'll go do it so far.
4575.0,4578.0, I think got to the point where there's any like real strategy involved.
4578.0,4585.0," I mean, you could see that it's modeled after strategy game where you, you collect items and you're able to outfit your armies with them."
4585.0,4591.0," And there's different unit types by, you know, getting food and and clink or whatever they call money."
4591.0,4593.0," Okay, what are they called?"
4593.0,4595.0, I don't have that fun.
4595.0,4599.0, That's so far it just seems pretty like an actual play part.
4599.0,4602.0," It's just like stylistically, it's just fantastic."
4602.0,4603.0, It's pretty fun.
4603.0,4605.0, Like a $19 game for peace.
4605.0,4609.0, There's enough play in treating aspects to this that I have to go pick it up.
4609.0,4613.0," I've been looking forward for like the last week, but then I found out it's not up yet until today or something."
4613.0,4614.0," Oh, it's not."
4614.0,4615.0, So how are we going to do?
4615.0,4619.0," I was borrowing the library, the one up library copy and alternative."
4619.0,4627.0," Yeah, because I kind of got to the point where you could tell that there's some grinding involved for basically you want to say you get to a level and you got like a boss or something."
4627.0,4630.0, You got a fight and you have to have the right unit make up to do it.
4630.0,4634.0," But in order to get those units, you need to go back to the levels you've already beat."
4634.0,4639.0," And basically do your version of attack, move attack, attack, move attack, move."
4639.0,4640.0, I'm level's you've already done.
4640.0,4644.0," Yeah, over and over again until you can get the units you need to go fight the boss."
4644.0,4650.0," And then after a while for me, I don't know, maybe I'm just like, cold hearted, but the pat that pat that pat that on."
4650.0,4654.0," It's just a bit of cute, but it was just like, and I got other games."
4654.0,4659.0," I went picked up paper Mario, super paper Mario, who wanted to play some of that."
4659.0,4666.0," I mean, mostly doing console games is like last week and I'd be double make up for."
4666.0,4668.0, How is that?
4668.0,4669.0, It's really good.
4669.0,4671.0, I had a first reason.
4671.0,4674.0," Those games I, I'm always just drawn to."
4674.0,4678.0," And it's some, I don't know what it is about those ones in particular over like, because I don't like got a war."
4678.0,4680.0, Sound the exact opposite.
4680.0,4683.0," God of war, I like really have my cry not at all."
4683.0,4684.0, God of war just doesn't do it for me.
4684.0,4687.0, But like Ninja Gaiden and double make cry.
4687.0,4688.0, I love.
4688.0,4689.0, I love the game.
4689.0,4690.0, Maybe it's just their hard.
4690.0,4693.0," I think it had the most fun with Ninja Gaiden, but then it was too hard."
4693.0,4697.0, And I wish it had the Ninja Dog mode in the original game that I played.
4697.0,4698.0, Morris pretty hard too.
4698.0,4699.0, It's not as hard as three.
4699.0,4706.0," It does this, it has this design philosophy like, like Ninja Gaiden that it lets you do easy mode,"
4706.0,4710.0," but it has to insult the hell out of you first for doing it, which is fucking awesome."
4710.0,4713.0," So like, a little scissy boy needs that."
4713.0,4714.0, Yeah.
4714.0,4718.0, And it also has this weird design issue where some better you do.
4718.0,4719.0, It's better you do.
4719.0,4722.0," Spawning to, to use or something."
4722.0,4726.0, And also has this weird thing with like the better you do.
4726.0,4730.0, The more skill points you get basically to buy new skills.
4730.0,4736.0," But it's kind of counterintuitive because if you're doing bad and you're continuing too much,"
4736.0,4741.0," it'll deduct skill points from you, meaning if you're doing bad, you can't make yourself better"
4741.0,4742.0, to get the combos and stuff.
4742.0,4747.0," So it's like this reverse, it's a very bizarre thing to put on to you."
4747.0,4751.0," Very much, but I still played the hell out of it."
4751.0,4755.0, And it's just their weapons are really cool.
4755.0,4757.0, And the combos are really fun.
4757.0,4761.0," It just like, that came for me about like straight up action combo games."
4761.0,4762.0, Yeah.
4762.0,4765.0," That one just, they just feel really fun and that came to me."
4766.0,4767.0, Enough to try it.
4767.0,4774.0," It's always surprising to me to see how people are like, they like want and hate the other like Ryan chimed in to say that he hates an inch of guidance."
4774.0,4779.0," And because you always see this like, you, you, you can get with this or you can get with that."
4779.0,4783.0," And it's like, there's so few games of this sort, especially the Japanese ones."
4783.0,4787.0," It's like, once you like both, when you want to play both, I don't know."
4787.0,4788.0, Right.
4788.0,4789.0, Yeah.
4789.0,4791.0," I mean it would be like me like saying,"
4791.0,4795.0," like half life to episode two or do you like Bioshark, which is it going to be?"
4795.0,4798.0, And then expecting you to hate the other and to spend all this time.
4798.0,4805.0," The other problem is that the console, I think that the platform stuff gets in the way too there is when people have points to this one looks better."
4805.0,4806.0, This one is out right.
4806.0,4810.0," This one is more like thoroughly associated with this platform, even though it's now available."
4810.0,4812.0, I don't know.
4812.0,4814.0," I mean, maybe it is."
4814.0,4819.0," I mean, clearly, there's people are going to like one prefer one game over the other, you know."
4819.0,4825.0," But it just seems weird to me that because I like kind of both of those games, but what puts me off is like you're saying just the difficulty level."
4825.0,4829.0," I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to ever want to be frustrated playing a single player game again."
4829.0,4834.0," I get to hit this point where it's like, why am I paying to be frustrated?"
4834.0,4835.0, Right.
4835.0,4839.0, Why am I paying and then choosing to use my time this was to be for entertainment to frustrate myself.
4839.0,4842.0," Some people get that in any other, don't get that with books and don't get it with me."
4842.0,4843.0, Is there anything?
4843.0,4844.0, Some people like that though.
4844.0,4846.0, I know my roommate likes to.
4847.0,4852.0, He likes the massacistic part of like being beat up in Ninja Gaiden and then he likes the accomplishment he feels.
4852.0,4853.0, That's the thing.
4853.0,4854.0, That's the thing.
4854.0,4855.0, That's the thing.
4855.0,4857.0, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment ever for for.
4857.0,4860.0, Beating a video game or something so that because of that.
4860.0,4861.0, That's what achievements are for.
4861.0,4865.0," That means that the punishment seems like doubly unnecessary, you know."
4865.0,4866.0," Yeah, I'm kind of with you."
4866.0,4868.0," I think for me, I just learned."
4868.0,4870.0, When to quit.
4870.0,4875.0, So like the only type of games that really make me mad to the point where I'm like yelling at the team.
4875.0,4879.0, Like those YouTube videos of the guys freaking out the only time I get to that.
4879.0,4883.0, I mean when I get to that point the only time I do is in games like Mario games.
4883.0,4887.0, It's what I'm having to repeat and that it's when I know how to do the thing.
4887.0,4891.0, I get it but I can't do it because of the timing or whatever.
4891.0,4892.0, Yeah.
4892.0,4893.0, That's when I lose my shit.
4893.0,4897.0, But it's at the point where I'm about to run level in Mario that do that to me.
4897.0,4899.0, But now I know when to quit.
4899.0,4901.0, Is it a dread not level that you're on?
4901.0,4902.0, I will see it's been weeks.
4902.0,4903.0, It's okay.
4903.0,4904.0, I don't even remember.
4904.0,4911.0, But now I know when I when I start even feeling that when I'm like going back to the same thing and in my head I'm going.
4911.0,4915.0," You know and my wife walks by and goes, are you okay?"
4915.0,4916.0, I'm fine.
4916.0,4918.0, That's when I know okay.
4918.0,4919.0, Turn off the week.
4919.0,4920.0, Yeah.
4920.0,4921.0, I'm not having fun now.
4921.0,4925.0, I just take a minute to turn the trade to me and put him in a trade to trade and probably hit that point.
4925.0,4927.0, I do it as a kid because right.
4927.0,4928.0, Said it over and over again.
4928.0,4929.0, But it's like well right.
4929.0,4930.0, You're big for a game.
4930.0,4932.0, You're not getting another one for a while.
4932.0,4933.0, You're damn well better played.
4933.0,4934.0, And then now.
4934.0,4939.0, In a review scenario where you have to you don't have the option of just saying I'm not going to play any more.
4939.0,4942.0," Thankfully, I don't get those kind of games that very often."
4942.0,4945.0, I kind of decent saying kind of games I review.
4945.0,4946.0," Yeah, it's nice to hang in there."
4946.0,4948.0, Just get a signed random shit.
4948.0,4949.0, Yeah.
4949.0,4951.0, Then it wasn't at the case of EGM.
4951.0,4952.0, When you were a bit.
4952.0,4953.0," Well, it was always that way."
4953.0,4954.0," Yeah, it just reviews."
4954.0,4958.0, And that's why I got this is some of the most horrible experiences I've ever had like the evil dead.
4958.0,4959.0, One of these evil dead games.
4959.0,4965.0, That it was like the whole infinite regress series of game progress where there's this gate.
4965.0,4968.0, And you figure out right away that this is the gate you need.
4968.0,4974.0," You need to open, but to get to key you're like, okay, well, I need to go and get this guy something."
4974.0,4976.0, But then you go to get that guy something.
4976.0,4978.0," It's like, well, to give the item to give to the guy."
4978.0,4980.0, You got to do something else and on and on it goes.
4980.0,4981.0, And they would embed it in that game.
4981.0,4983.0, Some like five six steps deep.
4983.0,4986.0," And at the same time, it's just the gameplay itself was just dumb."
4986.0,4990.0," And then I just lose track of everything and figure out what and I'm looking at the clock and they're like,"
4990.0,4993.0, You reviews do two days.
4993.0,4996.0," It's like, well, that's fucking good because I spent my whole day on one level."
4996.0,5001.0, I can get to that horrible.
5001.0,5002.0, That's horrible.
5002.0,5004.0, That's a good thing that you've had the bad.
5004.0,5007.0, That's a concern to me though when I'm reviewing is that.
5007.0,5011.0," You know, like, I need to always feel like they need to make sure like,"
5011.0,5016.0," if I'm getting frustrated, am I getting frustrated because my progress is impeded"
5016.0,5021.0, because I'm feeling that the deadline looming right or is is the progress impediment.
5021.0,5025.0, What would it would I be okay with this if I didn't if I knew.
5025.0,5027.0, I didn't have anything to do after this.
5027.0,5032.0," Yeah, those are all the moments when it's best to put the game down and come back and then get right past that thing."
5032.0,5034.0, You were getting stuck on right away.
5034.0,5038.0," But those are the moments where you can't because you're like, I don't have an hour to spare."
5038.0,5039.0, Right.
5039.0,5041.0, I'm not going to bed till I beat the fucking thing.
5041.0,5042.0, Yeah.
5042.0,5044.0, Good times.
5044.0,5049.0," Generally fun with print because our deadlines, we don't really even get in that scenario anymore."
5049.0,5055.0, At least in GFW because there are a few or games and we're not having three people review every single game.
5055.0,5057.0," And that, yeah, we'll have to watch that."
5057.0,5060.0," No, that, you know, we're back on the online to think as well."
5060.0,5062.0, I'm reviewing front lines now.
5062.0,5064.0, I decided not to talk about it yet.
5064.0,5067.0, I guess just because I'll wait and get a more fully formed impression.
5067.0,5071.0, I've been playing the campaign was actually pretty fun.
5071.0,5079.0," You know, it's got, I mean, clearly the AI was, was improvised for a multi, what's, like ultimately a multiplayer game."
5079.0,5084.0, And it's just there to help fill in the blanks in this single player mode that they're making.
5084.0,5090.0," But as far as a single player mode goes for what I think of as a multiplayer shooter, it's pretty damn fun."
5090.0,5091.0," So far, I'm really liking it."
5091.0,5094.0," I'm more concerned about multiplayer actually just because I,"
5095.0,5102.0," the first map, the first and only map I played so far was really aircraft heavy, which is fine because I love that, but there were so many."
5102.0,5109.0, And so few people that everyone had to do anything on the ground because they were seemingly like impotent in the face of the helicopter and jet attacks.
5109.0,5110.0, Right.
5110.0,5112.0, So there's the usual problems.
5112.0,5114.0, I'm curious to see how they handle those.
5114.0,5117.0," And little things like, you know, how they handle rockets."
5117.0,5120.0," I'm a big fan of the, the tow rocket in Battlefield 2."
5120.0,5125.0," Just basically, it works like the rocket doesn't have life to where you point at something and it's laser guided."
5125.0,5129.0," And the, that's fun because there's like a bit of manual input involved."
5129.0,5131.0, And there is a reward.
5131.0,5139.0," That's where I feel gratified in games and stuff is like if I'm like, if I hit a helicopter, it's flying full speed, a quarter mile out with a tank shell."
5139.0,5143.0," And I just, I intuitively did perfectly the amount of drop and lead on it."
5143.0,5146.0, And then I'd see the thing blow up that feels really rewarding.
5147.0,5151.0," So it's great to use the missiles that way too, because even though they're wire guided, they're slower in Battlefield 2."
5151.0,5153.0, So you'll have to work it.
5153.0,5158.0," And this is the old, you know, you hold over, you hold your crosshairs over it and you get a lock and you fire the button and forget about it."
5158.0,5160.0, And there's a lot of that.
5160.0,5164.0," And it kind of makes me really wish that like, like, I guess I'm kind of getting my wish with Battlefield heroes."
5164.0,5167.0, I was going to say that the next big Battlefield game actually go back to World War 2.
5167.0,5174.0," That seems like a weird thing to ask for, but I mean, there's, there's so many things that work better in my mind with,"
5175.0,5181.0," with non automated weapon systems, non, you know, heat-seeking missiles and lock-ons and countermeasures and stuff."
5181.0,5191.0, Because those are a lot less fun than just doing figuring out how to lead your target with old fashioned cannon fire and hitting them rather than just passing by someone in.
5191.0,5193.0, That was real war.
5193.0,5194.0, This is a way.
5194.0,5195.0, Like you had to point you.
5195.0,5197.0," It doesn't even at the enemy, there's something."
5197.0,5200.0," Perfect, perfect transition."
5200.0,5204.0," Yeah, I like that because it was fun, not necessarily for the realism."
5204.0,5205.0," However, I didn't want to bring this up."
5205.0,5212.0, We got these form form responses to GFW review of forgotten hope to.
5212.0,5219.0," It's a mod for Battlefield 2 and like what I'm asking for, it's in setting World War 2 in the North African theater."
5219.0,5222.0," Rory, Menden, reviewed it for us."
5222.0,5228.0," And first off, we reviewed it in the first place because I was like, this looks great."
5228.0,5231.0, These guys made it big mod for Battlefield 42.
5231.0,5232.0, They're back now.
5232.0,5234.0, They're skins.
5234.0,5235.0, They're items.
5235.0,5239.0," All the things, all the assets that they put together for this game just look professional grade."
5239.0,5243.0, There's a lot of potential for just to be a cool game.
5243.0,5248.0," So I was like, hey, just trade it just like one of the big boys."
5248.0,5251.0," The difference being, you can make a point where like, oh, you're going to score it, right?"
5251.0,5252.0, But it's free.
5252.0,5256.0," And I've always tried to explain in the podcast that, like, at least when I review a game,"
5256.0,5262.0," it's not just like, what's the value proposal here, whatever, what's the, it's like, is this just a good game or is it not?"
5262.0,5263.0, Let's look at this as a game.
5263.0,5266.0," And then since we don't do the consumer reports,"
5266.0,5270.0," the style thing and if you did a consumer reports style thing on a free mod, then it's absolutely free."
5270.0,5272.0, Then we think you're spending is your time.
5272.0,5275.0," So it would be like, well, that means they're automatically at 9 or 10."
5275.0,5280.0," You know, so I think that that is responsible for some of the harsh reaction that I've been picking up."
5280.0,5285.0," But specifically in the forums dedicated this mod, the guys are going,"
5285.0,5290.0," the guys are going crazy there because we, because we gave it a low score,"
5290.0,5292.0," we gave it, who was it a four?"
5292.0,5294.0, Something like that.
5294.0,5297.0, And they are just going wild there.
5297.0,5300.0, And some of them are completely cool.
5300.0,5302.0," It's like, understand, they really like it."
5302.0,5306.0," And it's always upsetting when someone else disagrees with you, you know,"
5306.0,5307.0, pisciss me off.
5307.0,5310.0," Like every time I, to be honest, every time I would hear about a game in the year,"
5310.0,5314.0," or for an RTS and go to CNC 3 or World of Conflict over company here,"
5314.0,5316.0," like, what the fuck do they know?"
5316.0,5317.0, You'd think that too.
5317.0,5319.0, That's exactly what I was thinking at our awards ceremony.
5319.0,5321.0," Yeah, CNC 3 got it."
5321.0,5322.0, One up readers choice.
5322.0,5327.0," Yeah, the RTS thing was for CNC and we're just like, you got to be smoking"
5327.0,5330.0, some of that shit that Corridis brother didn't want to smoke.
5330.0,5337.0," So it's like, hey, I understand that, but there's some really crazy misunderstanding"
5337.0,5338.0, going on.
5338.0,5340.0, And some of it was from my captions.
5340.0,5343.0," There was like, just kind of the usual snarky captions, right?"
5343.0,5344.0," Yeah, you have a few forums."
5344.0,5347.0," Yeah, like you're right in the caption, you could do something informative"
5347.0,5352.0, that sort of supplements the review or you just do something funny that's just like a
5352.0,5354.0, site joke site gag based on the screen.
5354.0,5355.0, So there are some of those.
5355.0,5357.0," And one of them was talking about a Halo jump, the first Halo jump."
5357.0,5358.0, This is a joke.
5358.0,5360.0, And that high altitude low opening.
5360.0,5363.0, It's a form of military parachuting.
5363.0,5368.0," And I think the people read that as they wanted Halo video game,"
5368.0,5374.0," style jumping in forgotten hope to, which is a random world or two"
5374.0,5375.0, modern something.
5375.0,5376.0, So I don't know that.
5376.0,5380.0," I hope that's what they're reading it as because everyone is like, this piece"
5380.0,5382.0, of shit just wants to be Halo.
5382.0,5383.0, This is just another.
5383.0,5385.0, This is what's this called games for Windows Magazine.
5385.0,5386.0," Oh, too bad."
5386.0,5387.0, It's not Halo 3.
5387.0,5389.0, This and this is funny.
5389.0,5390.0, I frustrating.
5390.0,5391.0, Yeah.
5391.0,5392.0," Because it's like, I was roaring."
5392.0,5395.0," Someone was an offensive reading just all this, you know,"
5395.0,5396.0, to roaring.
5396.0,5398.0," And I was like, oh, shit, like welcome to the club, you know,"
5398.0,5402.0, because like this any of us that's written reviewed knows that this is just how things
5402.0,5403.0, shake out.
5403.0,5404.0, Yeah.
5404.0,5405.0, Yeah.
5405.0,5406.0, There's going to be this group is going to be there for every game you play.
5406.0,5407.0," No matter what it is, you play game."
5407.0,5409.0," You're like, good God."
5409.0,5412.0," It's like, this is one of those kids that not even a mother could love."
5412.0,5415.0," But there's like, it's got a mother out there somewhere that loves it."
5415.0,5416.0," Not the makers, but a fan, you know."
5416.0,5418.0, They have friends around the forum.
5418.0,5419.0, Yeah.
5419.0,5420.0, I don't know.
5420.0,5421.0, I don't know.
5421.0,5422.0, Because they hate it.
5422.0,5423.0, And that's not the case with this game at all.
5423.0,5425.0," But so there's like that and they're assuming, and that's totally wrong."
5425.0,5428.0, It's funny because where he doesn't even really like Halo.
5428.0,5429.0, And he knows his shooters.
5429.0,5431.0, We played this game together.
5431.0,5433.0, Then the queuing of not having played it.
5433.0,5434.0, He played a whole lot of it.
5434.0,5439.0," Every single map, you know, and fully populated servers, which is hard to find."
5439.0,5442.0," That's something to point out is that they're about, you know, at any given time."
5442.0,5444.0, You might find three populated servers now.
5444.0,5446.0, And someone on the forums did point that out.
5446.0,5449.0," They're like, hey, well, at least, you know, look at it this way."
5449.0,5452.0, What he's responding to is the saying that it's he's judging it by how
5452.0,5454.0," fun it is, right?"
5454.0,5457.0, And he's obviously not alone because at least with forgotten
5457.0,5460.0," whole one, you could find 30 occupied servers nowadays."
5460.0,5461.0, There's just three.
5461.0,5464.0," So for whatever the reason, let's just assume that maybe other people are trying it"
5464.0,5465.0, and are having fun either.
5465.0,5466.0, They're on installing it.
5466.0,5467.0, They're not continuing to play.
5467.0,5472.0," But as a realism audit, it's led to this whole, you know, he just doesn't get it."
5472.0,5475.0," So I'll read some of these, these quotes from here."
5475.0,5480.0," So we got one reader says, you know, I consider the fact that none of your viewers"
5480.0,5483.0, understand the philosophy behind realism.
5483.0,5485.0, So the airplanes don't have realistic controls.
5485.0,5486.0, So what?
5486.0,5487.0, Which is really weird.
5487.0,5490.0," I picked this one because he's, everyone there is complaining."
5490.0,5494.0, This guy doesn't like it because he doesn't understand that it's supposed to be realistic.
5494.0,5496.0, Because he did talk about it when you play this game.
5496.0,5498.0, It's the North African campaign.
5498.0,5502.0, So you had just these huge open spaces with nothing but like a
5502.0,5504.0," toberk pattern, a bunker here and there."
5504.0,5506.0, Maybe a tank bear cage to hide behind or something.
5506.0,5509.0," And while that's real, what it translates to in the game is"
5509.0,5512.0," you know, maybe spending 15 or 20 minutes, whatever."
5512.0,5516.0," I mean, even some exaggeration, even five minutes is an extraordinarily long time and"
5516.0,5520.0, an FES to just be kidding from one place to another with no guarantee that anything
5520.0,5523.0," is going to happen when you get to your destination other than that you'll just be,"
5523.0,5528.0," you know, some rarely return to the deploy menu in time or because you're"
5528.0,5533.0," blown away by someone who's lobbying already from you from, you know, an actual"
5534.0,5535.0, placement in the map.
5535.0,5539.0," I mean, warrior, you know, no one's accusing of being like magic missiles and"
5539.0,5542.0," just like, want on arbitrary death that doesn't make sense."
5542.0,5546.0, Someone is actually on like a 17 pound or something and they fire the shell across
5546.0,5548.0," the map kill you, but you didn't know where it was."
5548.0,5553.0," Then at the day, it's like, you're going across the desert and you're dying and"
5553.0,5557.0, you're doing it again and maybe again and again or whatever or real life.
5557.0,5558.0, Right?
5558.0,5561.0," It takes like, if you got a bunch of guys with nothing but with"
5561.0,5564.0," Iran's the tanks going to, we're not in this get in and fields in this case."
5564.0,5568.0," It's Brits and they're going to, the tanks are going to blow you up."
5568.0,5572.0, That's the end of the story unless you've got piazza or something to defend yourself.
5572.0,5574.0," And he was just saying, you've spawned in this game."
5574.0,5577.0, There might be five enemies and tanks outside your spawn just waiting for you to appear
5577.0,5579.0, so they could blow you up and get it again.
5579.0,5584.0, You have absolutely zero chance of of killing them.
5584.0,5587.0," Well, that's real, but who wants to do it so long?"
5587.0,5590.0, I want to do it if I'm the dude in the tank.
5590.0,5591.0, Right?
5591.0,5596.0," He was just making some of these points, but then at the same time he also commented that like,"
5596.0,5601.0," for the total, you know, someone who's just insist on slattish realism,"
5601.0,5604.0, there's weird anomalies like the planes aren't realistic at all.
5604.0,5605.0, You can ascend indefinitely.
5605.0,5607.0, You can just point your planes straight up and go and go and go.
5607.0,5609.0, You'll never stall some of these other things.
5609.0,5615.0, So that's why it was weird that the guys saying this guy doesn't understand the philosophy behind realism.
5615.0,5618.0," And then he also goes, you know, so their planes don't have realistic controls."
5618.0,5621.0, What is the philosophy behind that?
5621.0,5625.0," He's a mean at all realism, it's up for planes, whatever."
5625.0,5631.0," So another guy was upset and says, I think the caption that we should have lend-least"
5631.0,5634.0, the British and new color scheme shows entirely what kind of person he is.
5634.0,5638.0," He's just pissed because A, there's no yanks, boohoo, this isn't metal of honor."
5638.0,5643.0, We don't have to focus on the faking 101st airborne all the time at the expense of everyone else.
5643.0,5647.0," I'm so sick of seeing games based around the 101st, you wouldn't believe it."
5647.0,5649.0, He clearly doesn't understand realism.
5649.0,5654.0," Surprisingly, mate, a bullet of any caliber fired from pretty much any distance up to 1500 yards."
5654.0,5658.0," Less than the case, a pistol rounds I admit, will kill your pink supple, full-ush yourself."
5658.0,5660.0," That's life, deal with it."
5660.0,5665.0," See, again, with realism, the geography of the North African campaign eludes him."
5665.0,5667.0, He wants close quarters urban battles in a desert.
5667.0,5670.0, I have to interject and say he actually didn't say that.
5670.0,5673.0," You might be barking up the wrong palm tree, matey."
5673.0,5677.0," The thing here again is that's life, deal with it."
5677.0,5680.0," To you, this is a game."
5680.0,5684.0," Even though it really doesn't play some factor in it, it has to be fun enough."
5684.0,5687.0," You like the realism, but it still has to be fun."
5687.0,5690.0," This is just being gazing and some, this is real in some way."
5690.0,5692.0, You don't know the philosophy of real.
5692.0,5701.0," And, I mean, if that's life, deal with it, it's like, okay, there are plenty of aspects of being in the military."
5701.0,5702.0," I mean, when do you stop?"
5702.0,5703.0, Do you want to have it?
5703.0,5708.0," So you got to start walking in shitty speed if you don't change your socks, keep your feet dry."
5708.0,5709.0, What about disinteri?
5709.0,5715.0," I don't know, four of them are 40% of the dudes in that campaign, we're shit themselves, like every day."
5715.0,5717.0, Why don't we have that?
5717.0,5719.0, It's just like a dumb thing.
5719.0,5725.0," You say the reviewers acknowledging that, like, and very clearly, you're saying, this is the type of game this is."
5725.0,5730.0," At the same time, at the end of the day, I can't put myself in these other imaginary shoes."
5730.0,5732.0," Well, if you're this person, you could really like it."
5732.0,5734.0, And I hate when people do that.
5734.0,5735.0," It's like, you are who you are."
5735.0,5736.0, And you know what it's like to be with.
5736.0,5737.0, Is it fun or not?
5737.0,5741.0," And you just say it like, even though we like red or construed it in the extent, even though we played for"
