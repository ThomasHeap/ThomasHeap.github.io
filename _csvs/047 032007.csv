50.120000000000005,52.96, I'm feeling gun-hol about games for Windows
52.96,56.76, It's feeling the room people say the mic I was behind the
56.76,60.72, Internet it's like I could imagine you got on the way to the Toyota factory or whatever
60.72,64.96000000000001, To they're doing your calisthenics before you start today. We might work out together later
64.96000000000001,70.08," Right, right. I was thinking more like a break dance crew kind of tracks you two got going"
70.08,73.56," Oh, yeah, we could break dance later than workout go up against EGM"
74.08,78.74000000000001," Yeah, we're awesome people are saying that Microsoft's not really you know pushing this"
79.3,84.3," Gantz-Royn does initiative hard enough, but apparently they haven't seen the official track jacket"
85.58,87.58, You need proof in your face
88.78,94.96," Okay, so hi everyone I heard the last couple podcasts that I wasn't on were great"
95.53999999999999,97.53999999999999, Which tells me something
98.53999999999999,100.53999999999999, The message board's dead. Oh
100.53999999999999,102.53999999999999, I'm just gonna shut
102.53999999999999,104.53999999999999, Take it
104.86,106.86," No, this thing gonna work"
107.86000000000001,112.22," Okay, so we've been talking before we we got a lot to talk about today in fact"
112.22,115.54, We're gonna hear Sean's opinions long awaited opinions
115.54,119.02000000000001, Sean Aliots on stalker because he's were being at force in the next issue
120.14,122.14000000000001, We're gonna talk about
122.14000000000001,124.94000000000001, Paggle early game of the year contender
126.26,128.26, Dam you pop cap
128.26,131.85999999999999, It's a three-year question. L2 we got L2 we're gonna talk L2
133.06,135.06, I know what that stands for
139.54,146.73999999999998, And but we've been had a couple philosophical issues we've been battering around here the last week or so here at the magazine indeed
146.73999999999998,151.18, It worked out well like last week. I wanted to I was hoping to bring these up
151.74,159.18, But I kind of wanted to draw on your experience because the first one involves something that you you were the one that told me about it
159.18,164.70000000000002," Yeah, so well it happened over GD so so the theme here both of them are instances where"
165.70000000000002,170.70000000000002, People that are in the industry people that do make games for a living have publicly said that
171.34,177.38, People in our position who write about games for an a living for a living can't do a few things or there's a few things
177.38,184.7, We're not qualified to do so the first one all you take it from here is is in short that we can't review or critique a game
185.5,187.5, Without having made a game for ourselves
188.42,190.42, Right
190.42,194.06, Right no so go ahead and wrong on right this showed up we were
194.06,197.01999999999998," Look but bring up yeah, yeah, right"
197.01999999999998,200.9, We heard this at the game developers conference in San Francisco
200.9,202.9," Oh, that too we go"
203.46,208.46," So this is that part of the stories a bit old news, but I wasn't around here to talk about that"
208.46,214.54000000000002, But Ryan and I had attended a conference at the game developer's conference a round table of
217.1,222.46, Game developers mostly and there were a few journals talking about the subject was game criticism
223.26,228.70000000000002, And it basically turned into a kind of lots of developers bitching about how shitty
228.94,234.85999999999999," Game reviews are these days which for the most part there they're right, but one point that came up was"
235.29999999999998,239.57999999999998, Which was agreed upon it got some huzzaws around the table was was
240.61999999999998,246.22, You know these guys meaning us are not really qualified to review video games because
246.54,250.73999999999998, They don't know anything about what it takes to make a game like this they haven't been there
250.73999999999998,253.78, They don't know what it's like to program. They don't know what it's like to do
254.7,259.66, 3D art they don't know what it's like to write dialogue for game characters
259.66,263.18, So who are they to judge whether a game is good or not?
263.18,268.24, It didn't surprisingly I think you told me that at least one member of the press was sort of yeah
268.24,270.78, These guys know what they're saying one he's one brought it up
271.06,275.98," No, he wasn't one to brought it up, but he he quickly ascended to what to when that point was brought up"
275.98,279.22," Somebody who actually not only worked for the press, but they worked for one up"
279.62,282.98," That one point and he was sort of like yeah, you're right"
283.3,287.14000000000004, So now it's like what the fuck you talking about
287.14000000000004,291.26, What I heard is I don't know what it's like to spend 50 bucks on a game as total crap
291.26,296.06, We'll see that's heard of course. That's the main point. We do know what a site to spend 50 bucks for a game
296.06,298.62, We are writing from the point of view and a game player
298.74,304.90000000000003, Which is who they're marketing and selling those games to people who play games first on on just to know
304.90000000000003,310.58000000000004, I mean for you even need to elaborate you can pick up a few comparisons and it's right and our office
310.58,316.94," Yeah, it's like have you I mean to know to be able to say anything good or bad about a television show"
316.94,318.94, We're a movie or comic book or a song
318.94,325.41999999999996, Do you need to have made any of those things yourself and that's on our artistic level on a mechanical level or technical level
325.7,327.86, Say if you're a pilot fighter pilot or something
327.86,332.82, Do you need to have manufactured a plane yourself or designed a plane to test a plane and say hey
332.82,337.65999999999997, This is useful. This is going to be good for me under the circumstances that it was created to be used in
338.54,342.74, So it's that's logic. That's pretty you know that that makes it clear
342.74,347.58000000000004, But at the same time like you said we do notice like to a body game and and because of these guys
347.58000000000004,354.38, Actually I would argue that in some ways that they're probably less qualified to review games having worked on them
355.1,358.82000000000005, I don't know if they're not quite I don't want to reverse this and say you can if you've made a game
358.82000000000005,362.46000000000004," You can't reveal game, but but just this if you follow me here for a second because"
362.97999999999996,368.58, Because you know and you appreciate the difficulties involved in all these things and you are going to be sympathetic to those
368.58,375.29999999999995, I'm going to go easy on them. You're going to go easy on them in ways that an average consumer just does not give the give right give it
375.29999999999995,377.29999999999995," Sure, yeah, because they don't"
377.58,383.26," Pair about okay, well, it is extraordinarily difficult to stream this kind of you know information pack in or these circumstances"
383.26,387.21999999999997, They don't just don't care right. They see is this game fun is it doing
387.53999999999996,389.97999999999996," You know, is that guys face the black-a-melted mannequin?"
390.06,393.5," You know, I'm just wondering if it comes down so plus one star"
394.62,400.82," Right and and yeah, and we all are our experts at playing games right and enjoying games"
400.82,406.86," You know, we take it actually even a step further which is that which only further proves the point"
406.86,415.14000000000004, You're making which is that we won't let someone review a game here if we if we feel that they're too close to the development team as it is
415.3,419.74, Like if somebody if somebody if I know somebody has like what was that Sean?
419.98,424.94," No, some kind of awesome guests are up shit on there. I don't know where it came from a few to my mouth"
426.94,430.62, They're getting guys are coming up there. It's like Rod Mcdonalds
431.78000000000003,433.78000000000003, Awesome
434.98,443.70000000000005," Okay, if we know somebody is close to developer we don't want them to review the game because we think you know like if you've been to see"
444.26,452.06," whoever like Darren okay, you've now gone to see the stock the guys making a hellgate. Sorry a couple times now"
452.06,457.82, I would be not inclined to have you review the game because guys because you've been hanging out with those guys
457.82,464.18," You know what they've been doing. I don't mean even on a friend basis, but even to sing them do the work makes me think"
464.18,466.18, We might be more inclined
466.18,472.82, Give them a break. That's another story though. I mean I'm saying like I mean my argument is that if you if you know all the ins and outs of the development
472.82,476.74, In general and you're sympathizing with just how difficult it is to do it
476.74,481.86," But I think in that case, it's really like you you want to insulate our critique against"
482.42,486.1," Like sort of nepotism or something, you know you don't want like"
486.1,488.98, I mean if we got into close to the project or something
488.98,492.42, But in this case if you're saying you know the circumstances it was created in
492.42,497.86, I don't know that's another story because it is interesting because I do know for a story I'm working on now that PR people
498.82,504.66, Will actively try to guarantee that it is the writer who spent the most time previewing and visiting
505.06,510.46000000000004, You know the developers that are making a game is that is that that's the same person who actually does the review
510.74,514.42, You know it's it's funny. It swings either way because like there are games
514.42,518.34," I mean whatever with hell game, but I mean like there's some games that I know I followed really closely"
518.34,521.62, And then when the game finally came out and I actually was on board or review something
521.62,526.66, I was actually harder on it than a lot of people because I saw the potential that was blown early on right well
526.74,532.26," You're right, maybe it's a different topic. I mean the the basic one you're saying is that we brought up in the first place"
532.8199999999999,539.2199999999999, I think it is right. I mean and listen it applies to like every single aspect of the entire world of art
539.4599999999999,540.66, I mean
541.06,541.86, painting
541.86,543.4599999999999, architecture music
543.4599999999999,547.6999999999999, I mean none of the professional critics anywhere not I shouldn't say none right
547.6999999999999,555.06, But but in general the average critic is not someone who came from that field right there their field was actually journal is on
555.14,560.66, It's an age old I mean all far older than games mean for people that have been critics of novels
561.38,566.66, You know literary critics and everything else. I mean a version of the argument has been around for ages
567.14,573.2199999999999, But it was just really I don't know is it's kind of stunned me to hear that coming out of this you know this game is development conference
574.26,579.4599999999999, That there's something so idiotic is that and then not only that you didn't just hear someone in the snack line
579.9399999999999,583.2199999999999, A dude who's nicknamed is little big planet because he weighs like 400 plus
584.1800000000001,588.82, You know getting himself a chiro or something you didn't hear him like mumble that but there was like
589.22,590.5, It was time
590.5,592.5, Space and time set aside
592.5,598.34, Really for the purpose of saying that you can't comment or critique a game unless you produce the game
598.34,600.58, What really the whole round table was a bit
601.14,603.14, I don't know why did you think right?
604.74,610.58, I don't know if they were they were kept trying to they look like dancing around all this stuff that they couldn't really
611.46,612.6600000000001, Quantify
612.8199999999999,617.06," Yeah, it's so I wasn't there, but it sounds like a bunch of like irate coders who worked on games"
617.06,618.26, I got pan on the press
618.26,619.4599999999999, I
619.4599999999999,623.9399999999999, Apparently it was sort of like you remember that like that there is no bestier bangs
624.74,626.74," Right, there was a lot of that going on"
626.74,631.6999999999999," Yeah, there's no lesser bangsters no Roger ebert at the games industry"
631.6999999999999,636.3399999999999, I mean it was just a lot of stuff that you could you could take a part in 10 different ways
636.74,639.22," Okay, so basically one of us has to make beyond values of the doll the game"
640.1800000000001,644.02, Or something like then only then only then will we be?
644.02,646.02, We know how to do this yeah
646.26,649.3000000000001, It's like that point that you know we can't
650.1,652.9, We can't critique games unless we know what is to make them
653.22,657.22, It's like then just begging like well why don't you just give everybody an A for effort
658.82,661.0600000000001," Right, I mean that's what that boils down to"
662.1800000000001,667.62," Kind of yeah, I'd say that's fair. That's yeah. That's another I made a text adventures a child maybe we should"
668.58,670.58, Maybe we should have a separate great effort
671.78,673.78, Give everybody gold star
674.02,676.18, All the effort so the other thing that we were told
677.0600000000001,684.26," Comes from and this has been sort of beaten the death, but I have I think that at least I wanted to come in on it and see what you guys say because I think I was slightly different"
684.98,688.42, Thing to say about it. This is Dennis Dyak of
689.3,692.5, Silicon Knights which is making two human for Xbox 360
693.14,695.62, Was on EGM live just the EGM podcast
696.58,697.94, It wasn't even last week
697.94,705.94," It was two weeks before right yeah, so that's how old played out this is but anyway part of part of the whole thing that caused such a sensation on there was that he took"
706.66,708.98, EGM to task for having an opinionated
709.86,711.14, Preview
711.14,717.7, And and it's different like I want to take it more general and say you know like because I think his argument was you should the very notion of an
717.86,720.98, Evalued of preview is kind of pointless kind of stupid
721.94,727.22, There's like a whole sub argument there about it being about the the way that it appeared because that was you know
727.22,733.94, EGM's E3 issue and it appeared in the context of an E3 feature and their logic on that of course is that
734.66,738.9, For the same reason that you see all these bought the same developers like I'm sure whoever publishes
738.9,740.9," You know, it's not Dyak's doing whoever publishes game"
741.86,747.94, If they want some E3 judges awards did there'll be more than happy to put those on the box or on the promotional website or something
747.94,750.9," You know, hey, we want so more and more people put"
750.98,755.54," Put playable product at the show floor in a way to be a value expected to be evaluated, you know"
755.54,757.78, I mean just the assumptions there if you can win in a word
758.26,762.1800000000001, Right someone's evaluating your stuff so it's like I don't accept your word you have judges
762.9,765.22, But so in the in the larger scheme of things though
766.34,768.1800000000001, I agree with them in this sense
768.34,771.7, You don't it would be and this is and we talked about this before on the show
771.7,777.62," You know, I felt like okay, they're just going right where we've been and that it's so dumb to write a preview and talk about how the"
777.7,782.26, Frame rates are coming along or how such and such technical aspects of the game need to be addressed
782.66,786.66, I mean it's just the same as if you know you're you're writing a preview for entertainment week
786.66,790.98, We have whatever movie king corner something and you talked about how well right now
790.98,794.02, There's people running around and screaming in front of a green screen
794.02,798.82, But we have ever reason to believe it in six months time a large gorilla will will take the place of that screen
799.78,804.34, And we'll be grabbing this people so that is completely stupid and I agree with it. However
804.98,806.98, That said
806.98,810.1800000000001, The essence of the game so to speak or whatever the design of the game
810.1800000000001,814.34, I think it's totally or we're totally able to comp comment on it and evaluate it
814.34,815.94, Right not only and not only
816.26,821.38, It's not even a matter of if we are and we just do it in some matter of if we own up to it or not like whenever say
821.38,822.9, We companies coming here
822.9,828.1800000000001, This is going to get just trouble. We won't name any names. What say company comes here. They come to our floor and we have one up here
828.34,830.6600000000001, Like trying to give him monthly games for windows magazine and
831.62,835.9399999999999, If there's a demo if sometimes if it's something that's cop people's eye
835.9399999999999,839.78, You know it might be the pedigree or it might be just the premise of the game or whatever
839.78,843.14, But everyone's in there. You know and they want to see it and then there's times when there's like
843.62,847.4599999999999, No one in there. There's like one person like goes in there just because they feel obligated
847.4599999999999,850.74, It's kind of like Russian or less and you're already going to be a hero hiding
850.74,855.4599999999999, So at that point you're already evaluating things to the extent where you can say
855.86,857.78," Okay, if this is a game like you know"
857.78,863.14," Here's another case, you know they brought in Elviano while ago and this game is got it's got every"
863.6999999999999,867.6999999999999," Chance of becoming something cool, you know a 360 in-piston game. It's based on you know fighting whatnot"
867.6999999999999,873.54, But looking at it I immediately said this is a hack and slash game where you run around and there's there's no
874.02,878.26, Puzzle solving or anything to break them in-autony so it's entirely going to come down to how engaging
878.5799999999999,880.5799999999999, It is to fight however
880.9,884.9, Although there's combo systems in place and stuff like that you could do more than just match a
885.6999999999999,886.9, um
886.9,890.98, It seemed it oblivious to what God of War has done
891.38,899.3," What you know even devil may cry is done to it, you know an inch of guidance what these other games have done and what the price of entry has has since changed to"
900.02,903.06, in this category of game and immediately I could say well
904.18,908.5799999999999," My gut so far as it says this is not gonna be if if this is all there is to it. No, you know"
908.5799999999999,912.74, It's not gonna be and you can say it's gonna change but so many times and we don't talk about these things
913.14,916.1800000000001," We're for a perfect right, you know other people review it and they say"
917.22,923.14, That's interesting. It was exactly what I was wondering about like you know 12 months ago or something that so in cases like those I think you can
923.86,929.38, It's not a conclusive. It's not like I mean there's always always that the element of that a game can change
930.1,933.86," I mean if it's a preview that's the whole notion. It's a work in progress, you know, right but"
935.86,939.86, You can I do think I mean that we can't do it not only that. Here's another point
940.5,941.86, Game companies
941.86,946.58, Let me give you a example will employ people full-time there call game evaluators
946.9,949.46, But what they do and and I was actually offered a position
950.02,952.66, At a major publisher before I decided to work for GFW
952.9,954.9, He purchased first C.J. W and
955.14,961.94, Part of that was doing you know writing mock evaluations and talking to people basically and and anything and this is based on anything from a very
962.26,963.0600000000001, Primitive
963.0600000000001,965.86, Primitive version of a game to just a design document
966.02,971.94, We're already at that phase. They're wanting you to evaluate not just is this something is this a product category that people are willing to buy?
971.94,973.46, Is it going to make us money?
973.46,979.94, But this is having a chance of being cool of being a good game and if they're already doing that the publishers are already doing that and
979.94,983.46, And pulling people full-time to do that again. I just think it reinforces the idea that
984.1800000000001,986.1800000000001, You can do something
986.82,990.1800000000001," You can't make some judgment. Well, they just don't want it unless it's positive"
990.74,993.78," Right, I don't know. I think sometimes in the past we've we've thought we've run an"
993.86,999.14," You know, evaluate it evaluative to a degree previews and we've made a comment and that actually got"
999.86,1006.5799999999999," I can't run the exact example right now, but I made a comment about something that you'd be fixed in a game and by the time the game came out"
1006.74,1011.06, They actually made that change that exact change. I'm like well good. I'm glad in some small way
1011.06,1016.8199999999999, I'm glad I you know that game got fixed if if not by my saying at then at least a billion other editors who price of the same thing
1018.02,1022.42, So I mean I think there is some some merit to it as long as you balance it out and not make it like
1022.5,1027.3," Okay, the game's gonna suck because of this just long as you know, right if you would have you in this constructive criticism"
1028.02,1032.58, It's just the pieces you have to figure out which pieces are the ones that are important and like
1032.8999999999999,1038.02, You know the most likely to not change by the end and like you know the design decision made from the beginning
1038.02,1040.02, same like if you read a script for a movie
1040.18,1041.94, to bring it back to you know another
1041.94,1046.58, Our form you could say all right you can read the king Kong script and you know
1047.3799999999999,1048.18, You know
1048.18,1050.18, Certain things about the movie
1050.18,1054.18, Whereas like if you saw the green screen you would just kind of dismiss that and say of course
1054.18,1060.18, I'm gonna accept it. You can't really the script what it is you know what it's gonna be right and that's the really dumb part about our
1060.26,1066.74," Well, that's a problem about our industries that that I mean because we're halfway between like technical pages and and"
1067.46,1072.26, Art critics you know let's the maturity of the critics at this point. They just have an inquiry figure out how to like
1072.26,1075.7, Where to fall in that spectrum and they sometimes get so wrapped up in the eye candy
1076.18,1081.8600000000001, If you think of the maturity of the entire business the one good point that somebody made at that at the
1082.74,1088.74, At that game critics rounded that I thought was interesting was and maybe kind of true was he said that like
1090.02,1092.02, Because of the technology because
1092.5800000000002,1097.22, So much of what happens with new games and new generations of games is technology based
1097.78,1104.66, That that the right the writing about it gets lost in that and he said it's as if somebody were to review a
1104.74,1107.38, Movie in 1950 and basically be reviewing
1107.94,1113.94," Cinema scope yeah, you know or technical are exactly the edge of the criminal yeah as opposed to the actual you know"
1114.9,1119.6200000000001, Content and that maybe if there becomes a point and maybe there is will never be a point though
1120.5800000000002,1126.02, Where games kind of stabilize where we're not just talking about the technology all the time we can sort of get beyond
1126.74,1130.74, That being you know the bullet point list that we go through right. I mean
1130.74,1137.86, That's just some shin in every category of never aspect of games. I mean that that's when you'll start getting more and I'm not saying that you don't have games
1137.86,1141.94, That have just really rich and vibrant art design now as opposed to graphics
1142.5,1148.74," You know, but you'll get more of that you'll get it's no longer going to be about just proving that you actually look good"
1148.74,1151.94, But then and then you can start worrying that you stop worrying about that you start worrying about the story
1152.34,1155.86, Start worrying about you know the AI to a greater extent than you ever have
1156.82,1165.2199999999998," And quality of interaction and all these other things worse like right now. I mean, yeah, it's well known fact what what one of the chief selling points for game is how good it looks and"
1166.34,1168.34, We can go all the way back to
1169.2199999999998,1173.3, You know some of the some of the the best looking pieces of shit that have ever been
1173.86,1175.86, You know
1175.9399999999998,1177.6999999999998, Yeah
1177.6999999999998,1181.04, Matt dog Mcree exists we can bring that up. Oh anyone's feelings
1181.68,1188.56," Yeah, we didn't stack point though. I mean"
1189.68,1193.68, You know those developers basically just want to see you lavish praise on their games
1194.3999999999999,1197.44," Yeah, it is credit. I think he did say"
1197.92,1202.8799999999999, I mean what did he say that he was for he he says he is for you know harsh or criticism and whatnot
1203.12,1206.1599999999999, And against like the point I don't I don't want to rehash everything about that
1206.1599999999999,1208.3999999999999, I mean that there have been tons of threads all over and
1208.88,1214.16," Two podcasts focusing on that and I just kind of wanted it to address that specific aspect of it, but"
1215.2,1219.2800000000002, It's really you know the reason why most of us hate writing previews
1220.24,1223.6000000000001, Because you're so caught in between this notion of
1224.24,1227.0400000000002, You know you want to be fair to the game. It's not done
1227.0400000000002,1232.0, You know it's not done so you don't want to be too harsh on it because that would be a little
1232.32,1239.76, That's a fair right yet on the other hand. We're not we're not we're not hired by EA or Ubisoft or whoever to do their PR for them
1240.0,1242.4, It's not our job to just give them publicity
1242.64,1245.52, We're trying to like tell other gamers about this game
1245.92,1247.92, Right and that's hard to do in a way
1248.32,1252.72, You know it's like you're saying it's almost by necessity you have to put some kind of opinion into there
1253.04,1256.88," Otherwise, you know, let's just like reprint their their press release"
1257.44,1258.8, You know
1258.8,1260.8, And to a large degree that's how it used to be
1260.96,1265.44, I mean like it's only in the past few years that people are finally at least we've always been pretty good about it
1265.44,1266.8, But I'll much by and large
1267.04,1271.9199999999998, You know bloggers websites some other magazines a short of my name was pretty much as reposted
1272.96,1277.84, Rest releases. There is a case. It's okay. So it actually was actually I mean the magazine's gone now
1277.84,1282.1599999999999," But it's called PSC2 PlayStation Extreme. Well, that was my favorite and they had the"
1282.48,1284.8, Transformers cover story and I was reading it
1285.76,1288.8799999999999," Well, when I first started in this business. I was read everything"
1289.44,1294.56, But uh so I was read it and I was like wait a minute. It sounds familiar and and as a you know
1294.56,1299.2, Was reviewing the same game and I just got all the press materials for it along with the review
1300.08,1301.6, And it's like wait a minute
1301.6,1307.6, So I went and I pulled that I pulled the press release out and I held it up against the page and they it pasted about
1308.3999999999999,1310.3999999999999, 600 700 words maybe
1310.96,1317.52, Into the story direct not even piecemeal not even like paragraph here that but just a block that big if you took just this giant block of text
1318.0,1320.5600000000002, And hit paste and then you just wrote around it
1320.5600000000002,1321.6000000000001, Wow and
1321.6000000000001,1327.92, For one I mean that's just sad but I mean and on so many levels even stylistically that no one's gonna notice that it's not a frankin just a
1327.92,1329.2800000000002, Stingyob because
1329.2800000000002,1335.52, You're writing a so in a single shibor from a press release anyway that no one's even gonna kind of see the duct tape on that thing
1335.52,1337.2, You know the same thing happen. I mean right I
1337.6000000000001,1339.2, Forget I forget where I saw this I
1339.2,1342.72," I was either a reviewer a really really late preview, but they actually like"
1343.28,1348.8, Line for line took the text from the press release and like just put it right into the text
1349.28,1351.28, We're working way too hard around here
1352.0,1355.2," Well, you know it was talked about that we remember that was like here. I was journey thing"
1355.2,1361.44," Yeah, that's it. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you only reason I remember it right that's right the only reason why I remember that is because in my story"
1361.44,1364.64, I actually I you know put it in quotes and kind of called and kind of turned into a little bit
1364.64,1369.0400000000002, Hold them on if we're talking about the same one. It was Jeff who did it. Huh are we talking about it?
1369.8400000000001,1371.8400000000001, I wrote I played to rise no
1372.0800000000002,1379.1200000000001, I'm thinking of like the here was journey shit and in your I wrote it. I wrote it my preview I wrote it my preview like way before
1380.24,1385.76, But maybe he brought up as well. I could use yet. I brought it up. I brought it up as a joke in my room
1385.76,1388.8000000000002," Yeah, I think I'll bleakly reference. This is so like okay"
1388.8000000000002,1390.8000000000002, Let's win side. I don't know
1390.8000000000002,1393.5200000000002," Sorry, so people can can can can understand what this is about"
1393.92,1400.4, Basically one review for a game and come out and there was a line that seemed really at a place for if for this publication
1400.4,1403.12, It was like why why are they bringing up this reference and
1405.12,1410.24, They're and pointed out that he had depressed release and that that reference was on there and so you look at it and it was like
1411.04,1416.32," Okay, so that's where you know it's like a review this is really bad viewing the reviewers. Yeah, you know some publishers"
1416.32,1420.56," We'll put together what's called what they call a reviewers guide. Oh, yeah, and they give it to you"
1420.6399999999999,1424.56, It's not like the manual or anything. It's like a list of points that they think are really cool
1424.56,1428.56," things you might want to mention and yeah, it'll review yeah if you're just a complete"
1428.56,1433.36," Here's a score you might want to put a series of shit, you know like you'll just go and you'll you'll go through that"
1433.36,1437.44, You'll bake you'll write an outline based on the or use like the outline provided in there and
1438.1599999999999,1442.8," Talk about these people into our gaming clues. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they are I"
1444.0,1447.6," I wonder yet no, they're more based on the features and stuff at least it the the gaming"
1447.6,1454.0, It's not even break it down by the usual graphics audio and I think you write down my pray review
1454.0,1460.1599999999999," I made some reference to yeah, you did it. Oh, it'll come back to the facts. Yeah, yeah, go back and look at that and piece together"
1460.1599999999999,1462.1599999999999, Whatever the story
1463.04,1466.9599999999998," All right, we're on here, Rooster knee where we're rambling here on the podcast. Yeah, we're sorry"
1467.4399999999998,1469.4399999999998, rambling so bring it back
1469.4399999999998,1473.76, Bring it on back bring it on back. Let's bring it on back to some evaluation of a game
1474.32,1476.32, Some of the things yeah
1476.8,1478.8, So how's that stalker Sean?
1478.8,1483.2, It's it's very cool and I think my review is gonna go up actually
1483.92,1487.28, My review might beat this podcast or it's gonna come out around the same time
1488.08,1489.84," Really, so you beat the game you're done"
1490.08,1492.4," So yeah, you just wrapped it up this weekend. I think the whole thing huh"
1492.4,1497.84, I might as well just not say the score just in case there's like an hour or so that like this podcast beats the
1498.1599999999999,1501.9199999999998," To explain I get in trouble, but I did I do I did"
1503.9199999999998,1505.28," Yeah, thank you"
1505.28,1507.28, Right you games I can't even talk
1508.24,1511.6, So now we're to begin on this thing. I solved the game tape
1514.3999999999999,1518.08, To twice but I got the thing is this is one of those games with multiple endings
1518.08,1522.0," So you got two different endings so far to get to that, but there's seven endings all together and they're"
1522.3999999999999,1525.6, It's got that annoying thing where they're I don't want to start with with this. I'm already starting with it
1525.6799999999998,1529.9199999999998, But there's like two true endings and five like slow endings. I got a slow ending
1530.32,1533.1999999999998, That's kind of like a disservice anyway. It tells someone they didn't get to the real
1533.76,1537.4399999999998," And get to real ending, but okay, starting from the very beginning this game"
1538.9599999999998,1544.24, It's great and I think that if you have any interest in playing you know first person shooters
1544.24,1547.52, Especially on PC you definitely need to need to play it
1548.48,1553.76, If you look at what's happened to first person shooters or you know North American made over the years
1554.32,1561.28, This game will put it perspective and show you how you know what's upon the time you know system shock at DSX and thief and there was like the certain
1561.44,1569.04, Way that things were going and then all of a sudden it was like the rain of Call of Duty and Half-Life and and this this other sort of like very strict very linear
1570.8,1573.44, Like I mean people talk about a roller coaster
1573.44,1580.64, It's a played out analogy for but it's pretty fair and that you get on the rails and and various exciting things happen to you
1581.1200000000001,1585.68, You have you know you have some degree and you're able to I mean the choices you make are always
1586.48,1589.1200000000001, Just basically how fast are you gonna go along the rails and
1590.16,1595.76, What weapon are you gonna shoot with yeah? It all went horribly wrong with middle of honor and those are fun games
1595.76,1599.6000000000001, I really I mean even if you want to say that that you know that Half-Life is that way
1599.6000000000001,1603.44, I mean there's so much about it. I don't want to turn this into to defending what Half-Life and Half-Life
1603.44,1607.2," Too do so well, but it's a it's a different type of game and then I say"
1608.0800000000002,1615.44, That um with Far Cry the PC game which after again clarifying because of some of our audiences listing and they only have console
1615.44,1622.4, Experience it was a different game than the ones released by Ubisoft on on Xbox and later on Xbox 360
1622.56,1625.6000000000001," But it was also similar, but it was actually developed in Germany"
1626.32,1628.32, And you get the sense there that like okay
1628.48,1630.4, We're gonna just create this large environment
1630.4,1633.8400000000001, They're gonna be any of number of ways to get through it. You're gonna have missions and stuff still
1634.1599999999999,1637.6799999999998, But you just not going to follow the specific rail we're gonna have to throw you know
1638.6399999999999,1642.6399999999999, Some other elements and then to make it entertaining no matter what path you do it with a path you take
1642.8799999999999,1646.8799999999999, So the trade-off has always been and that obviously just you know
1647.76,1649.12, Ryan thanks for y'all and then
1651.12,1653.12, There's a tickle wind out of the road
1655.12,1657.12, Talk about
1657.52,1660.8," Here it is, Phil of course the difference would be this you know this this"
1661.76,1667.28, Heavenly script a scenario where action the highest magnitude is happening every other minute
1667.28,1673.28, You know stalkers are coming out and guys are breaking through walls and stuff is supposed to maybe you take a path and all you're gonna run into is like
1674.0,1679.2, A dude with a guitar sitting out in a field and maybe a dog that's running around like looking for something to eat
1679.2,1680.0, You know
1680.0,1686.48, That's not necessarily what you what you will run into but that very well might be if you give to player that much control
1687.12,1688.24, You know
1688.4,1692.8, Unless you're gonna just cover the board like like centipede with with monsters everywhere
1692.8,1697.1200000000001," I mean that could that could be the nature of the experience so anyway, it's that sort of game"
1697.68,1702.0, closer to oblivion it's kind of like halfway between oblivion and then the shooters that we know
1702.56,1705.52, But I think it's just so much fun because
1706.0,1708.0, I'm so
1708.0,1710.48, That was ready to talk about this I spent all this time right in a view
1710.48,1711.28, You know
1711.28,1715.44, Like say different things that I say their view without you know to make something that's complimentary to it
1719.2,1721.68, Well one thing I'll say while you try to fish for the words
1723.52,1725.52, Be on me out
1725.52,1729.76," No, I mean I I've I've been dying to play this game for for freaking a aberman and I"
1730.32,1737.2, I came back and as soon as I heard you had a copy of it I called THQ beg for an extra code and started playing it this weekend too and
1738.96,1743.92, I had a lot of vista crash issues so I actually like it's no issues and it keeps crashing in vistas
1744.5600000000002,1748.24, Is a patch coming but I tell you it was it was like it was like I felt like
1748.24,1751.28, Sisyphus this whole weekend I'd play for five minutes. It would crash
1751.68,1756.72, I would reload the game and quick save it and just I keep basically pushing the edge further as I can go every time
1756.72,1758.72, But every little bit that I appreciated
1758.72,1760.72, Now on toddy it upgrade the vista
1760.96,1762.96," Yep, early adopters man"
1763.3600000000001,1765.3600000000001, Like me in the ass every time
1766.0,1769.28, So the technical I don't that's exactly what I don't know about getting the technical stuff
1769.28,1771.6000000000001," Okay, you know that actually like just say that one bit so carry on"
1771.9199999999998,1776.9599999999998, I guess what I'm saying is that when I looked at this the game feels different and I was trying to identify
1776.9599999999998,1781.28, What is the nature of the difference is it just because this is a game developed in Ukraine?
1781.84,1788.24, No are the things that this game does characteristic of your peeing games or more specifically Ukrainian game making
1788.8,1796.8799999999999, Or is it just time? I mean because that's another factor. This is also a game has been delayed that it was originally announced in 2001 and November 2001
1797.2,1798.2, um
1798.2,1804.96, And is it a matter of you know and I think that's that's largely the case in some ways if you take all those other games that I mentioned
1804.96,1811.2," Day effects and stuff and you go back to 2001 it kind of makes sense. You're like, oh, this was where things looked like they might have been going there"
1811.7600000000002,1814.4, So then you take this game that was kind of like a time capsule
1814.48,1820.0," But then ended up getting retrofitted to be to come out today that kind of makes sense too. Yeah, they dialed out a lot of stuff"
1820.16,1825.76," However, they're um and so let me just give some examples of the way that it works you know some of the ways I think it does"
1826.48,1832.32, Really succeed in being a game that that breaks itself beyond just the super strict real ride
1833.68,1839.52, At one moment I'm going down a path and I see you know on my on my radar some some blips of life forms and it will indicate
1839.76,1847.28, Whether they're hostile friendly or you know or they're they don't not persuaded either way to fight your to be your friend
1848.24,1852.6399999999999, And the reason that's there is because there's this client system in the game and you know much like a blavian where you
1852.6399999999999,1857.92, Can join one guild and you can have rivalries with or you could be a vampire and have rivalries with other groups and stuff
1859.52,1864.72, You can make you can make for and can be friends some organizations and and make you know have beef with others
1864.72,1866.72, But so I go over I see it and
1866.8799999999999,1874.16, It's just some guys hanging around this you know this torn down village just trees going through the room through the roofs inside the house as stuff and and if the guys says
1874.96,1876.16, I
1876.16,1879.52, K I have a goss gun you want to buy it for 800 800 bucks
1880.0800000000002,1885.3600000000001, I was like oh that's great. I mean the only reason I even knew what the goss can and was was because I played multiplayer
1886.16,1890.4," And unlocked it for fortune there and it's just kind of like the got it a rail gun basically, you know"
1891.0400000000002,1893.8400000000001, So I was like oh great sounds awesome all do it and here's my money
1893.8400000000001,1897.52," You know, of course he rips me off sound too good to be true and it was and he's just like"
1898.16,1902.16," You know, Bucky you and then he goes over to his friends and he's like get out of here"
1902.64,1904.64, Before we fuck you up
1904.64,1909.8400000000001, So I was like I happened to had just found a grenade launcher a little bit ago and I had three rounds in it
1909.8400000000001,1911.8400000000001, So like I tested that out
1911.8400000000001,1916.5600000000002," I threw all those dudes away and I went back and I took my money off them, but then I realized that"
1918.0800000000002,1921.52, I'd spent more money getting getting the grenade launcher rounds
1922.0,1925.28, Then the a hundred bucks that I lost the dude so I still felt kind of ripped off
1925.28,1927.28, I was probably about 400 bucks short still
1928.4,1929.44, Breaking even
1929.44,1934.64, The principle but the fact that there is even a moment like this I mean it and if you're not PG player
1934.64,1938.0800000000002," You're like yes, so what when I do that kind of thing in every game I play"
1938.64,1941.28," We don't always do that in shooters, you know, and why I"
1942.24,1949.1200000000001, Strong advocate for the level of complexity and sort of the degree of intellectual engagement that shooters
1949.1200000000001,1956.24, Especially multiplayer shooters require that is one type of decision that you don't ordinarily get to make the simplest it is it's very refreshing
1956.88,1963.84," Um, let me think of another example where you just you go somewhere like say for there's this large building"
1963.84,1968.0, And I'm supposed to get inside of it and instead of having you know the path laid out to me obviously
1968.0,1970.24, I mean it's marked on my map and I know I have to get in
1970.72,1977.2, But there's no clear way in the front gate's lock now walk around the whole perimeter and I'm looking and I can't really find a way in
1977.2,1981.92, And as I'm looking like this is exactly pretty much if I if I knew here's this complex and I need to get in
1981.92,1983.6, This is pretty much what I'd end up doing a
1983.84,1986.7199999999998, Case it and I try to figure out what's going on where the guys are and
1987.52,1992.56," And then like as I'm walking by here guy, you know, yellow whispers out to me at a window and he turns out he's a prisoner"
1992.56,1996.9599999999998, And he's like hey looks like you're trying to get in here if you do free me and I'll hook you up something else
1996.9599999999998,1999.6, And that becomes an optional side mission you can take or not
1999.6799999999998,2003.76, But so I you do find your way in and then once you are inside the compound gates
2004.32,2008.6399999999999, There's just any number I mean at least at least five maybe as many as 10 just different routes
2008.6399999999999,2012.48, You can go climb up stairs first come in the middle floor come in through the basement
2012.8,2015.6, And just go in and clear it out and get what you need and get out
2017.28,2020.96," But of course it's gonna play different every time you do it, but just this just knowing that"
2022.08,2026.88, I can go over here and see if this is dead end or maybe I can go over here and it's like not there
2026.88,2031.68, No giant arrows floating around in the screen and and this is something I think that is
2032.0,2036.8, Characteristic of American games of late and and it's characteristic of the the mass market nature games
2037.2,2040.48, The more people you know that you have more and more people playing games and
2040.96,2043.76, Especially games of this category a first-person shooter
2043.84,2047.04, It's got to the point where you have to make games for everyone you know
2047.52,2051.44, It's like I there a few I talk about sort of the no no game or left behind mentality
2052.32,2056.96, Where you know if you're writing a book or or having a movie you can have a complicated
2057.52,2060.56, Section and people are gonna skip by it. Maybe they won't understand it
2060.56,2064.16," But it's the movie is gonna go on or they could still keep reading you know, but in a game that's it"
2064.16,2066.8," If they don't get it that's then it's just a dead end, you know"
2067.28,2070.2400000000002, So there comes the point where like in perfect dark zero you got to put the
2071.76,2076.0800000000004, Flashing arrows on the ground and say this is where you got to go or in you know
2076.4,2080.96, In Japan in half life two they have the our survivor arcade game and they're just giant arrows
2080.96,2082.96, They're right that's different
2083.6000000000004,2088.8, Then a do that one call of duty two with the putting the grenades and the it does yet rocks or whatever
2088.8,2093.28," I mean whenever you had the little something yeah, I've been glowing this or that it was like a mouse click"
2093.44,2096.4," Yeah, and it and whenever you have something like that like say"
2096.6400000000003,2099.6800000000003, There there wasn't called duty to a mission where you know
2099.6800000000003,2106.1600000000003," You need to repair wires and as a mouse click just like you're saying. Oh, it's F you hit the F key to fix these broken wires"
2106.6400000000003,2110.2400000000002, But when that becomes the the mode of interaction
2110.2400000000002,2112.96, Then that's all you're really doing is you're going up to it pressing
2112.96,2117.92," Yeah, if you're not thick you're no longer fixing wires as if you would actually pull out some tool and set"
2117.92,2122.2400000000002, Their messing with it while you're getting shot at maybe had to go take cover or throw some more smoke go fix it
2122.7999999999997,2128.0, You're gonna lose a few people or a few people are gonna have to like look in a manual or something maybe you know
2128.3999999999996,2135.2," But um, but that's just that's one of the dangers. I mean when you start making a game for every person and every single person is gonna get through it"
2136.24,2141.2, You then the highest the game the highest level the games are in B is for the lowest common denominator
2141.2,2146.0, You know right so that kind of stuff is refreshing it just feels like this game assumes your intelligence
2146.0,2148.0, In ways that I'm not used to you know
2148.08,2152.08, Remind me a little bit your description of it sounds like a operation flash point
2152.32,2154.96," Yeah, that's another that's a game that it's definitely"
2156.32,2163.12," I mean, oh, that's a people are gonna want to talk about this game as you know in the generic formula take a portion of this and a"
2163.12,2165.12, Pugines
2165.12,2171.12, Or the worst case when they say it's equal parts this this and then they and then they don't realize they have like an odd number
2172.24,2176.16, How can you have equal parts of a fucking odd number actually? That's that's from
2177.12,2179.12, Some preview that's out now for a game
2180.24,2182.24, Yeah equal parts
2184.24,2186.24, X Y and Z E O my and
2186.64,2189.92, My favorite another just going on impressions you know another
2190.24,2194.0, Toward the end of the game in the town of Pripyat where you're getting close to the sarcophagus
2194.0,2200.3999999999996, Which is just where the actual Chernobyl reactor melted down and they threw the big lead containing thing facility over it
2201.3599999999997,2205.8399999999997, It's like it's clearly late in the game you're supposed to be getting a move on their snipers everywhere
2206.48,2210.48," Just a lot of guys are fighting and you're like okay, I really I know I need to go"
2210.48,2214.7999999999997, I don't have any reason to go check over here. I mean just how big is the city but I did and
2215.7599999999998,2220.72, It's kind of weird. It's like a whole new way of gauging it normally in a game if you see a bunch of enemies somewhere
2220.72,2225.04," You're like okay, it's probably worth going over there because that's one of the ways that the developers told me"
2225.6,2230.7999999999997," That it's worth going over here, you know because there's gonna be an ammo supply or cash of some cash"
2232.0,2235.44, So you do that and and there's not in this game
2235.76,2239.28," It's not just for that reason but there's like a whole like I'm like okay, I'll go over here"
2239.28,2243.12, And there's a whole building and you go in and the whole thing's rendered interiors
2243.12,2247.92, You know when I go upstairs and there's guys to fight in it and I'm still fighting and doing stuff and I could take ammo off them
2247.92,2252.0, And get their guns and stuff and then I just keep going around the whole back court and like
2252.8,2254.96, To the point where it was like this is just nuts
2255.44,2264.32," You know, it's just so far away from me getting to the end of this level and this stuff is just here like who took the time to model all this and put it in when only like"
2264.4,2266.32, 10% of the audience might check it out
2266.48,2269.52, Similarly you can go on a field or something to find a massive a
2270.88,2276.7200000000003, Like a torn down factory or something and again in another game if you see something that big where they've invested
2276.7200000000003,2280.96, You know like when you get to the bridge and half life too when you see a bit of environment where they've invested
2280.96,2285.28, Such a great degree of labor until you say they're gonna make some use out of this
2285.6000000000004,2288.48, There's gonna be a puzzles in this thing. We're just gonna be enemies
2288.96,2290.96, This gripped it shit chains gonna come chute and buy
2291.92,2298.0, And so you do and you go and the only thing in here again is like maybe there's like two guys that were in there
2298.0,2304.16," Haven't had an assace or something and some birds up in the in the rafters, but you can climb up around in it and"
2304.8,2309.3, Everything is just rendered and it's like maybe you know at some other time
2309.68,2314.8, Depending on how things worked out you could have run into a gang of you know wild board or people or something
2314.8,2318.64, But it's just so weird you just don't because it's not cost effective. I can't imagine
2318.96,2321.44, You know a lot of developers saying yeah go ahead and
2322.16,2328.24, Take two weeks make a big factory. There's gonna be two guys if there's no maybe three of you people that buy this game will go check it out
2328.56,2331.2799999999997," You know, it's pretty awesome though. I totally love that"
2331.2799999999997,2333.2799999999997, How much of the game is like that?
2333.2799999999997,2338.72, I mean like excuse me is like a good amount of it's that way. I mean it's not like I said don't don't give me wrong
2338.72,2341.2, Don't go buy it and feel ripped off when you realize that like
2341.92,2348.56, You can't go any you know you can't basically pick a compass point and go in that direction and just free wheel of until you know
2348.64,2352.16, I mean because you will hit the ends of the earth and some way shape or form and there
2352.16,2354.24," They might be you know, they'll use radiation"
2354.24,2358.24, Cl-invisible radiation cleverly to tell you that you can't go somewhere or this or that
2358.48,2363.44, But there's still there's there's a lot of options. I mean there's a lot of extra stuff that is just there
2363.8399999999997,2367.7599999999998, I don't know if it's just me like being trained on easy games or whatever
2367.7599999999998,2371.2, But if I went into that big tower expecting you know something at the end
2371.7599999999998,2375.6, Like some game you'd be like you like kind of ripped off or ripped off right like yeah
2375.8399999999997,2378.4, Like I took the extra time to do this extra exploration
2378.64,2382.3199999999997, So I should get the rocket launcher right and it's just there
2382.64,2386.08," Yeah, you go to the roof that and that that was the same thing. It's like I made it to the roof"
2386.08,2389.12, I found the way up and maybe that wasn't even obvious so you're like surely
2389.44,2393.68, There's a sniper rifle sitting in the giant crate of like armor piercing around you know
2394.24,2398.3199999999997, And then then a bunch of guys are gonna come running and try to take the factory back because whatever
2398.56,2402.48," Did you get the trigger point yeah, but it just isn't there and it's weird. It's like the whole point"
2402.8,2408.4, I mean I could be a scrap maybe this was just a messed up part like for all I know like the guy that made it
2408.96,2413.52," It was like I was in the level yeah, we didn't they teach cute to all this we had to get this game out"
2413.52,2418.2400000000002," They're supposed to be a level there and whatever, but this guy thinks it's a work of art so you know"
2418.2400000000002,2420.2400000000002, I'm not gonna just fuse them off off
2422.32,2428.32," That unspeaked levels great, but you know like without it been my and that actually would have been my like probably first thought is like"
2428.32,2430.88," I don't know if I was this or yeah, I was this here"
2430.88,2437.6800000000003, I would have been disappointed in in creating but but I mean going with my theory to spin it to something positive
2437.6800000000003,2439.6800000000003," No, no like that"
2440.32,2447.36, If atmosphere is everything in the game and is the chief success of it is just creating this world and that's just how places are they don't
2448.32,2451.52, It's like there's if you go out in the field there's not like a tree in a rock over here
2451.92,2455.1200000000003, Just so they can hide the gold underneath it that leprechaun buried for your ass
2455.12,2460.4," You know, it's like they're just there and they're just like that's part of what it means to be there and and that's a very cool part of the game"
2461.7599999999998,2466.3199999999997, Some other things about it does well as the Dernan if you got to any that like the underground stuff
2466.3199999999997,2472.64," You know, I didn't get I didn't get very far because of like my issues, but then again, I kept playing it trying to get as far as I could and"
2473.3599999999997,2475.6, Let me see I did I did the first band of the base
2476.16,2480.56," Okay, so I'm really really really on I just did a couple of big a couple of missions like five seconds"
2480.56,2483.7599999999998," Seriously, but and that that five seconds took me about like an hour"
2483.84,2486.0800000000004," Okay, let's get lost your long time then"
2487.36,2492.0800000000004," That's my biggest and that cause of your shitty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it feels running it to frames. That's why"
2492.0800000000004,2496.6400000000003," No, I don't actually it was working great just whenever I try to quick save or save or any kind of like"
2497.6000000000004,2500.48, Change of menu state was just kind of like some kind of weird instability
2500.96,2505.6000000000004," Again, it's a technical issue that I know they're working on and I'm still looking for the plan again"
2505.6000000000004,2510.5600000000004, How big is it like how long to take you to break like bust-through the first straight run?
2510.5600000000004,2513.1200000000003," I mean no, I mean Ryan I played it for"
2513.92,2515.92, I've had it for a while
2515.92,2521.6000000000004, And then playing the one hours. I don't know I really don't know less than that and you probably play but I did I'm I'm fat
2521.6000000000004,2526.0800000000004," I play these games pretty quick. Yeah, I don't obsess over every side mission there is you know"
2527.84,2530.5600000000004, But there's plenty of game there. That's not even an issue
2530.5600000000004,2533.44, I mean there's definitely and this thing is selling for like 29 or 39
2534.1600000000003,2539.5200000000004, 40 bucks so it's like you get game for your money right so to go back to some other stuff
2539.52,2544.16, I want to say about is that if you look at it as an FPS with an RPG slant
2545.28,2547.28, It's easy to be really positive about things
2547.84,2553.44, If you look at it as like a true hybrid where if you're an RPG player and you're expecting a full you know fully fledged RPG
2553.44,2555.68, You're gonna be disappointed or feet different reasons
2557.2,2560.48, The money system by the time I finished the game and it was like I realized I
2561.44,2565.2, Had tons of money and I didn't have anything to buy with it or anything
2565.2799999999997,2570.0, You know there are only a few key places to get weapons aside from killing them and finding them
2570.0,2572.0, It's a purchase and stuff and trade
2572.56,2576.96, All the items and then getting your inventory the artifacts that would be the equivalent of like you know
2576.96,2580.96, And oblivion you'd have all these different ingredients to make spells with and you can you know
2581.2,2586.56, Cast all these effects on your armors and stuff and instead you just get you know one one artifact might give you
2587.3599999999997,2589.3599999999997, Resistance to radiation but make you weak to
2589.7599999999998,2593.04, electricity it could make it so that you bleed out slower
2593.12,2600.8, But it burdens you all these things like that and an RPG would be absolutely essential to manage those say
2600.8,2608.0," You know, I need to I'm going into a highly radioactive area. I need to just completely buff against radioactiveity and do this and that and you can kind of get by"
2608.0,2612.0, I've that really mess with any of that you know and and by the end of it it just doesn't feel
2614.0,2618.24, Like again like I'm saying it doesn't feel like they had really figured out a way to deal with all this
2618.72,2622.8," You know, I mean you can't you can't just go like if if you if you get to a"
2622.8,2627.84," Really hard point in an RPG, you know, you could teleport back to town and buy a whole bunch of an item or something in this"
2627.84,2632.8, You'd have to walk your ass way and it could be a whole long way as a way a walk back to the dude and then
2632.8,2636.1600000000003, Biobunch of health packs and you're almost better just trying to improvise and go from there
2636.7200000000003,2642.0, But the reason I bring up the the RPG thing is like the the underground sort of kind of the equivalent of the
2642.0,2644.96," standings for dungeons in this game, you know where"
2646.2400000000002,2649.6800000000003, All the big you know all the big questions stuff end up in these underground facilities
2650.16,2653.6, But they're really cool because I mean usually like the dungeons are
2653.6,2656.7999999999997," You know supposed to be oppressive and stuff in these kind of games, but in this game"
2657.2799999999997,2661.7599999999998, It's like it becomes a horror game and they do some really scary creepy shit in there
2661.7599999999998,2665.9199999999996, It's like I was far more in there playing this and I was playing fear for example
2666.56,2671.2," Which positions itself straight up as a horror game, you know and"
2672.48,2674.48, It's just cool cool things. I mean
2674.48,2677.7599999999998," I mean sound is always key you hear stuff, but there's"
2678.0,2683.44, These invisible forces that that one part and you're not used to this you don't know that this is something that can happen in the world
2683.44,2685.44, But they start throwing things at you
2686.7200000000003,2693.36, There's these weird flaming polter guys that sort of like a fire will appear in a room and just start like moving itself around and you have to duck under it
2693.36,2695.36, It flies over your head and
2695.36,2697.36, Thor's are banging and stuff and
2697.6800000000003,2704.32, You see some weird mutant that the equivalent of effect that like grabs onto your mind and like pulls your conscious out of your body up into its face
2705.04,2709.04, Basically gives you like the psychic raspberry and then let's go
2709.76,2715.28," I mean all kinds of cool stuff like that and I I mean just was really I mean you're going around with your flashlight, you know and"
2715.6800000000003,2720.6400000000003," You know doomsday, but it just for some reason it was just so like oppressive and just nasty in there"
2720.6400000000003,2722.6400000000003, I couldn't wait to get out
2722.6400000000003,2726.48," To get upstairs again, but it was fun. I mean it was it was it was it was because it feels scripted"
2726.48,2728.96, They felt like you were being well like you actually were being like hunted or something
2729.52,2732.32," Yeah, and I just wasn't like it just took me a little bit longer"
2732.32,2736.88, Maybe to figure out the exact extent of like what the hell was going on that like you know
2736.88,2741.1200000000003, You can figure out the extent of the monster closets and doing pretty quickly or something and the game still give me through
2741.1200000000003,2746.2400000000002," But um or in fear it was like okay, these ghosts guys are just gonna keep coming out and"
2747.1200000000003,2750.4, And they do good stuff. There's that you get false positives because the out in the world
2750.4,2753.6800000000003, There's you know the electromagnetic anomalies that will distort the air and space
2753.6800000000003,2758.88," Yeah, and then once they condition you for that to that for good three or four hours later on you get these"
2759.12,2765.36," Invisible guys are cloaking so you might think it's just uh, but an anomaly on the horizon or something that's blowing around"
2765.36,2769.12, But really it's like some dude running like on a looping at you on all four is coming
2769.12,2772.2400000000002," You full speed and then like right when it's in your face you're like oh crap, you know"
2773.6,2775.6, So does that that kind of thing really well
2777.52,2778.56, Any other question?
2778.56,2781.2000000000003, It's all this everything it sounds like the less you know about it the better
2782.08,2784.08," Yeah, I"
2784.32,2785.28, Think I've I
2785.28,2788.1600000000003, Spoken I just know that it gets scary and that it does you know
2788.88,2793.12, The underground stuff is actually cool and and even there I was happy because there are so many ways
2793.92,2796.32," Like even the underground stuff is connected well, you know"
2796.32,2798.48, There's there's somebody you go into a tunnel and you can
2799.12,2806.6400000000003," Leave some other place entirely or use it to circumvent in some some cases, you know a lot of like fights that you might not want to deal with but"
2807.36,2810.6400000000003, At the cost of being scared for a while
2813.44,2816.96," It's cool because we've been needing a good shooter again, been a while"
2817.68,2822.0, As in it it has been a while I think it's a very good single player shooter
2822.0,2826.0," I don't think even last year. Yeah, that there was anything I'm back to pray and I like this yeah"
2826.0,2830.7200000000003, I like this kind of experience right so much it's so rough around the edges and it's so
2831.28,2836.96, Like pray will seem so much more polished and it's just controlled in every other way but like this is like
2837.28,2838.96, I'll take this over pray any day
2839.68,2845.04, Just so much more rewarding to me and and it's just the uniqueness of the other whole thing
2845.2,2850.24, It's cool because this was sort of kind of getting you know a bit of a paint around it for being so late
2850.24,2852.8," Right, yeah, we were all starting to kind of worry"
2852.8,2853.6, I think yeah
2853.6,2862.24," That's what's one thing's come out that all can be forgiven if it turns out good. I mean anything up in the pray right and hey, you know what if Duke Nick and Trevor is great"
2863.7599999999998,2869.12," If it ever comes out it will get a great review. Yeah, you know, I mean all bets will be off when that thing"
2869.52,2874.8," If that thing ever ships yeah, the time is like I said in this case, maybe it was a good thing and that like it"
2875.04,2877.04, You know at least for my experience that the delay
2877.68,2883.12," It wasn't trying to stay with the times and it wasn't trying to stay with the big Hollywood as a shift of the genre, you know"
2883.7599999999998,2887.36, It meant that it does mean that the graphics I they they they do it great
2887.36,2891.36," I mean if you have the right rig for it crank them up look great, but it's not not correct"
2891.36,2893.36, It's or anything
2893.36,2897.36, It came from an era when like it was I mean this was like one of the first games as I suppose to show up with DX 9 can do
2897.36,2899.04," Yeah, so"
2899.04,2900.96," So this is like what four years ago? Yeah, in fact"
2900.96,2903.2, I think that's how most of us saw the first time yeah
2903.2799999999997,2910.96, We didn't even see it as a game demo right it was a tech demo that Nvidia was making so they really succeeded in because if if you saw it as a tech demo
2910.96,2912.96, And it was that type of game that was gonna succeed
2913.8399999999997,2919.3599999999997, Or sell on the strength of its graphics I got to the point where whenever people would combine the office and see me playing it
2920.0,2923.12, Very believe the first thing that would comment on is like how it looked like butt to them
2923.6,2929.3599999999997," Really well I think what people combined a PC, you know like the guys from EGM and stuff come by they want to see there"
2929.3599999999997,2930.3199999999997, You know like
2930.32,2936.1600000000003," Show us just to find why you got to pay all these thousands of dollars to play these games on this thing yeah, and"
2937.04,2940.7200000000003, And I've always wanted to talk about the graphics now. I was like by my reaction so it's like
2941.76,2945.92, Shut up about that. I don't care like you know like it tells me that the game was working like
2946.6400000000003,2950.8," It's strong the game is better than the sum of its graphics, you know and the best it's just"
2951.1200000000003,2953.92, It wasn't ever an issue for me. There's never a moment where I said oh
2954.32,2959.44," Well, there's one moment in the very beginning and I showed Ryan there's a dude's wrist that looks so jacked and"
2960.0,2965.04, Once you get by that that was like the only time where I actually poke fun and laughed at like how dumb and bad
2965.04,2966.2400000000002, How bad it looked
2966.2400000000002,2972.16, It was wrong with his wrist it just looked like if you took and twisted it if it was like made a rubber and you just took and twisted it and twisted
2972.16,2976.88, It was like the joint was like about a millimeter thick point between two triangles
2976.88,2982.32," Ha, it made no sense there's other wrists in it like that is just this one maybe it's like a birth the fact on this guy"
2982.32,2984.32, I don't know
2984.32,2986.32," Yeah, it's a genuble"
2986.4,2987.6800000000003, Anything's possible
2987.6800000000003,2991.28," Nobody's it is cool though. They you know you may look like bud, but I think it's it's fun"
2991.28,2993.2000000000003," Yeah, it's like bud. I don't think it does"
2993.2000000000003,2995.28, I mean just as obviously doesn't look like heldgate or
2995.84,3000.0800000000004," Crisis but you could play it on a four-year-old machine and it's gonna work. Yeah, that was great too"
3000.0800000000004,3003.28, Like at home. I mean I'm playing on a 9800 radio on card and
3004.6400000000003,3009.2000000000003, It runs fine there. I can't I haven't figured I slated what the deal is with with the work PC
3009.52,3014.4," 70 100 that it why it's not working so well on that, but yeah, yeah, these busted work off work machines"
3014.64,3019.6," Yeah, I really wish that it's moments like that when I do and be console words like we don't have to sit there and"
3020.08,3026.7200000000003," Try to sort out how much we have to talk about this performance shit. Yeah, you know, it's like I want to engage the game"
3026.7200000000003,3031.44, It's self not the fact that like you're saying not the fact that the tech the color is broken or something
3031.44,3036.64," You know, and we have to at times if the game like you know if the game is not gonna run for anyone"
3036.64,3040.2400000000002," It's not gonna run, but it it is it would be nice in a world where"
3040.8,3043.44, Like it runs. That's fine. Let's talk about the game now
3043.92,3047.92, I think it's it's infinitely better than it used to be and that's because you know
3048.4,3053.68," Stability encoding wasn't quite it, you know is good back then so now I mean like we're actually way beyond where it used to be"
3053.68,3059.28, I remember reading entire reviews that were all about game bugs and game errors as opposed to the actual gameplay
3059.28,3061.28," And so well, that's still happens now"
3061.68,3064.4," Well, but not nearly as often as it used to. That's sure"
3065.28,3067.28," Yeah, it does"
3067.28,3071.44, So that's taking up a great deal of time talking about but hey that's a game
3071.44,3076.08," We all wanted to know about yeah, yeah, we just wanted to I want to know about that for sure now I want to play it"
3077.52,3083.04," Okay, so we're gonna take a quick break and then we'll come back and talk about other things including"
3083.68,3085.68, Hegel
3089.68,3091.36," Oh, hello, I didn't see there"
3091.36,3098.4," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live the weekly podcast from the editors of electronic gaming monthly along with the wonderful sounds of"

3139.44,3143.28," Ryan the whole time. It's not helping me man. Yeah, Ryan you got to wake up think of it"
3143.84,3145.84, I think of it as glory that evil eye
3148.08,3150.08, Glowering and yawning
3150.48,3154.56, Deadly combination really is either bored with the or he wants to kick his eyes were saying
3154.56,3157.44, Little thing me tired his eyes were saying shift it
3159.7599999999998,3161.7599999999998, Whilst
3164.16,3166.56, So who else wasted their weekend play
3166.88,3168.08, Heggle besides me
3168.08,3172.32," Yeah, I play quite a bit of a pego since I couldn't get stalker to run properly"
3172.32,3174.32, I was playing people at the time
3175.36,3180.88, It completely was a secret appearance a cameo appearance in pego who does chuzzles
3181.2000000000003,3182.88, The tussles do
3182.88,3184.88," Wait, I missed them. She noticed the space levels"
3185.92,3187.2000000000003," Yeah, I"
3187.2000000000003,3192.1600000000003, You know I realize that many many levels of pego were going by where I wasn't even noticing the back of the background
3192.1600000000003,3198.1600000000003, House is too fixated on the tank so for inter-referential pop cap going on a fan was is bookworm in it
3198.8,3202.96," I didn't notice him, but you have to be a little funny for some of the for some of those"
3203.36,3209.2000000000003, I actually stopped looking at the back of us because they made them be as absolutely embarrassing as possible in every case
3209.68,3213.4399999999996, I mean could it play look play like your game with your daughter in the world and you'll be fine
3213.8399999999997,3215.8399999999997," No, they were actually the ones making fun of me"
3216.24,3220.7999999999997, My girlfriend was like cute like at the the jack the big smiling
3220.7999999999997,3225.04," Yeah, it's like that is nose up to the screen and you like big shots off his mustache"
3225.04,3227.04, As far as or whatever right
3227.04,3229.04, What is this cute
3229.04,3235.68," Yeah, yeah, yeah, basically yeah my my my wife Amy she she sees me playing it with like the the unicorn levels in the beginning"
3235.68,3238.08, She's like so you're playing it with unicorns now. That's what it's come to
3239.4399999999996,3241.8399999999997," Yeah, actually on yeah my wife came in the"
3243.04,3246.0, Last night I couldn't sleep so I got up and I was a plank baggle and
3247.04,3252.48," You know there's something about that game. I really really love it. I'm totally addicted to it, but there's something so"
3253.2799999999997,3255.2799999999997, Fundamentally kind of
3255.2799999999997,3257.2799999999997, Pathetic about it because
3257.2799999999997,3259.2799999999997, There's nothing to do
3259.2799999999997,3260.64, I mean
3260.64,3266.48, You click one button and that's your round you know once you just shoot the ball and then it's just pochinko
3266.48,3270.2400000000002," You know, I mean I remember going into pad and wondering what the hell's the fifth fixation with this thing"
3270.2400000000002,3272.4, I'm just watching a silver ball drop down on a fricking little
3272.4,3275.04," Flanko yeah, I'm like what's the point?"
3275.04,3277.04," Oh, not a chinko"
3277.04,3283.92," Yeah, you have you have some you have some control. Well, yeah, how far to the left or right you're gonna drop that thing? Yes, you can you can sort of aim it"
3284.48,3286.4, They're like now that I've beaten it
3286.4,3290.32, Put it on a half-time for stitches. You are you can sway it after it's been dropped by
3290.88,3293.12, Rubin pushing the air with red is for you
3293.28,3295.28," Yeah, push in the air right"
3295.52,3298.5600000000004, Then you have to start choosing which which dudes you want to be
3299.6000000000004,3303.6800000000003, How are you up sir? Well to be fair. I think the first shots are that way
3304.48,3307.36, And I'm not gonna argue that this is like it extraordinarily like
3308.32,3310.32, Demanding K
3310.7200000000003,3315.92, But later shots though and yeah a bunch of elements moving around in your timing
3315.92,3320.5600000000004, You're like trying to get stuck between and sure and eventually you will develop a pretty good
3320.7999999999997,3326.0," Intuitive gauge for where the ball at least not not past two bounces, but up to two bounces"
3326.0,3330.16," Yeah, and that that can be like very helpful when it gets to the point where it's like you have"
3330.7999999999997,3335.04, Someone's somebody balls to get like 40 you know right right now. I'll start going like okay
3335.04,3338.4, I have five shots left. I've gotten to use many. I know if I bank it off this
3338.4,3345.2," I mean, I'm definitely starting to develop some peggle strad. Yeah, it's like immediate like rewards for your intuitive"
3345.2,3349.92," Assessments, you know in your risk. I mean you're gambling you're like okay. Yeah, I have to get at least four on this shot"
3349.92,3354.0," If I put it this area, yeah, probably got like a good chance of that and see it play out. It's like"
3354.48,3356.48, That's like something up like
3356.48,3359.28, Golfland or Chuckie cheese where you drop the token and then like
3360.56,3362.56, Like that it is like that
3362.56,3363.84, They should make it look a little bit
3365.84,3367.84," Yeah, it's kind of like that"
3367.84,3370.2400000000002," But there's no tickets. There yeah, there's no tickets"
3370.2400000000002,3375.36, Like you have any tickets for the level of the ticket the river banks with like the two floating circles
3375.36,3378.7200000000003," That one was tough. Man. I always jump. Oh, it's like the dude in the boat"
3379.04,3381.04," I mean, yeah, there's like you've going to yeah"
3381.04,3382.8199999999997," Yeah, there's two tubes floating down the river"
3382.8199999999997,3388.3199999999997, It's funny that we were like before we started recording this we were all talking about the relative strengths of each of the different characters
3389.2,3392.7999999999997," Right, all shooters and different levels now when they come up on like oh man"
3392.7999999999997,3397.52," This was definitely like a flower power level. Yeah, I know go with the flower. But that but that though"
3397.9199999999996,3402.56," I mean, that's like we're so close to right in a strategy guy for playing a big a slot machine. You're right in"
3402.7999999999997,3407.2," Yeah, so on the one hand we're saying there's nothing to do and on the other hand don't change your underwear for a week"
3407.7599999999998,3410.08," Okay, really cap this is why it's a great game"
3410.08,3415.52," But there definitely a moment. Oh, well, that's sort of starting to say went when when my wife woke up in the middle of the night"
3415.52,3420.2799999999997, And she saw me not in bed like she she got up to check on me to see what I was up to and you know
3420.2799999999997,3423.6, I don't know if she thought she was gonna catch me like you know looking at porn or whatever
3423.6,3428.3199999999997, She you know she ran she ran to corner and I'm sitting there playing this game and she just looks at the screen
3428.3199999999997,3430.64, She's like you've got to be kidding dude. I know
3431.9199999999996,3434.96, It's like bad. I was like this is what you're up doing
3434.96,3436.96, I'm sorry
3436.96,3444.2400000000002," How there's like the pink balls are for bonus. Yeah, like I got this whole thing where I'm like I always talk about like touch the pink touch the pink"
3444.2400000000002,3445.28, I touch pink
3445.28,3448.32, It's like the list of comes in from the other room. It is like one of those scenarios
3449.36,3451.36, I was going on your past discussion
3453.6,3457.52," I think the other the big draw the game of course, duh is like when you finish the level"
3458.08,3462.88, It's like how many ways can you keep on bad asiness to it? You got slow-mo matrix slow-mo
3462.96,3468.2400000000002," Yep on your ball you did. Oh, did you enjoy the way to choice the main meal after every time"
3468.2400000000002,3474.08, It's just the big giant casino style number counters go up through the chance for a one last game of plink
3474.08,3475.52, Go to get the you know the the
3476.1600000000003,3481.12," 1000 in the middle and just and yeah, but well, it's 50 in multiplayer"
3481.44,3485.92," Okay, and that's why I've been playing a lot of lately and then you could do the replay if you want yep"
3486.48,3490.7200000000003, Which is so annoying when you're doing it in dual like in other persons like oh
3491.04,3492.72, It's replay again. Oh
3492.72,3494.72, It's replay again. Oh
3496.72,3503.9199999999996, I went out as playing yesterday. I turned the volume up because I knew that the boying and every single ball hitting the peg was annoying the shit out of my daughter
3504.3199999999997,3511.3599999999997," Well, I was in her room trying to read you think they would want to play that buying buying buying they didn't play it and get hooked at all"
3511.3599999999997,3513.8399999999997," No, she thought it was pathetic that I was doing that"
3513.8399999999997,3518.0, What I heard about it like this sounds like like Melissa my girlfriend is gonna like it
3518.0,3522.32, So that's why I justify trying the demo on my own and sure enough
3522.88,3527.44," It's completely loved it, you know, but then I saw something interesting too. I was like my friend Rory"
3527.44,3533.44, Who's like hardcore gamer we play all the shooters and stuff together. He got the demo and then you just like disappears off of aim
3533.44,3537.44, We were talking about something and like hours later. He's like dude
3538.96,3541.28, Your crab guy or something like that just an utterance
3541.28,3543.28, No
3543.44,3546.1600000000003, Oh shit you're still playing it and it turned down on the demo
3546.32,3549.2000000000003, He pips off the demo because you know it's like on the time thing
3549.6000000000004,3553.2000000000003, So we're gonna go to like the last damn thing like the Zen shooter
3553.2000000000003,3557.6000000000004," Yeah, he's like the last character on the demo in the course of like the time limit thing"
3557.84,3562.8," Yeah, that's like a 60 minute time demo, right? Yeah, so he just like jam through that bad boy"
3563.1200000000003,3568.48," But yeah, so it's not like it has pretty good replay value too that does you know"
3568.56,3571.76, I start getting into the yeah the strategy of which guy to try
3572.8,3576.8, Beat in your own score then they have all the challenge models with there's a ton of those
3576.96,3581.68, They are the pop-camp games are over too quick though. I think after having done this
3582.48,3584.48, Reactor the same way to
3585.04,3587.04, I think this is a bit stronger
3589.04,3597.12, But it's a friend you were all after after like in guys go back to it now now that like you see what the deal is it's like peggle like that game is red
3597.6,3603.52, But you'll beat it in like two sessions you'll be all like that's it right anymore like this these levels are so easy to make
3603.52,3604.7999999999997, Can't you
3604.7999999999997,3608.72," Just like well we need the peggle expansion now yeah, yeah, bring it on pop-camp"
3608.72,3612.72," Yeah, that's how those are with a lot of other games like rocket manias one of my favorites. I still go back and play"
3613.04,3616.48, It's like you could just keep even if you beat it you just keep coming back to it
3617.04,3622.16," Yeah, this one to me though. I mean as much as I like it and I really do like it it really felt to me at times"
3622.16,3624.16, I was buying a like this is the absolute
3625.12,3631.6," Lois comma denominator like we'll play the word you're making words, you know, but you'll at least you're dealing with shapes"
3636.56,3638.56, Like you know
3640.7999999999997,3645.8399999999997, Could I be any lazy or not really have it open in a window what you're like check it even or something
3647.6,3649.7599999999998, It's not even time well imagine this though now
3649.76,3655.5200000000004, You don't fall on to do the duel all the time and like the computer desk is like meant for one person
3655.5200000000004,3659.76, So it's like I'll pull up another chair and like another chair. I'm like way far away
3659.76,3662.6400000000003, Like you know at this like messed up angle like when you get the worst
3663.5200000000004,3664.88, I call the
3664.88,3668.0, Paralax seat and the theater you know when you're in the front row the far right
3668.2400000000002,3672.4, And all you see is like a giant dude on your side of the screen that turns to a widget when he goes to other side
3672.5600000000004,3677.84, So I'm playing it like that at Paralax view and just trying to enjoy it and I think I'm getting to the point now
3677.84,3679.84," Or yeah, I need to take a break on that"
3679.84,3684.88, You use gamepad as well gamepad sport. Oh my haven't tried. I don't know why you bother
3684.88,3686.88, I'm just saying if press the button
3687.44,3689.92, I'm gonna keep you eating and your gamepad
3689.92,3691.6000000000004," No, I just say in case you know we start"
3691.6000000000004,3693.92, I'll actually take a pull back a little back on the bed
3694.48,3695.6000000000004, Just chill back
3695.6000000000004,3696.8, I see
3696.8,3698.8, I'm not that least
3698.8,3701.6000000000004, I don't see why not like I'm like I said there's left or right
3702.2400000000002,3704.7200000000003, Shoot and then speed up time actually with the other mouth
3704.72,3710.08, Is that even once that can be good for what when you're waiting when you get to the big you know massive really
3710.08,3713.3599999999997," Giggle levels later on yeah, they're spinning and it's spinning"
3714.56,3719.8399999999997, And you want it to get to you want it to get out of your way or whatever or you're waiting for like a certain
3719.8399999999997,3721.8399999999997, Should you try to get that magic pink or the green?
3721.8399999999997,3723.8399999999997," Uh, I just speed it up to where you need to"
3724.24,3728.8799999999997, I learned to let you play later on touch pink. It wasn't until my second time through that I sort of love in the pink
3729.52,3731.8399999999997," Yeah, now go and then there's your cell by the"
3731.84,3737.2000000000003, Paggle you got the sound by Paggle turn turns down to do a lover of pink. I love the pink

3751.2000000000003,3754.4, I podcast with just dumb ass sit around and talk about pink
3755.92,3760.48, You'll notice I kept the nerd voice to a minimum too because I got that that mail ryan. I showed you

3775.76,3783.52, He says it the whole not only that he was like the sky writes in to me and he's pretty much ended the nerd voice as far as I can control
3783.52,3788.64," Man, just if one guy took the time to write to me and this guy knows this stuff too. I checked his blog out"
3789.6,3794.16, He didn't can't write a paragraph without having like wilds and varying and thereby and sigh

4087.04,4089.84, Say we fuck up the podcast you and me
4090.56,4092.56, You took oh
4092.56,4095.2," Speaking of talking about some your questions. Yeah, we could do that"
4096.08,4099.28, We can just read a question real a back in how long we've been talking?
4099.68,4106.32, One hour and 10 minutes wow like a epic an epic well we haven't all been in the same room in a while
4107.6,4114.24, Let's see they were they were a couple that I really liked in the read a question. So let's look over these
4115.12,4117.12, And one
4118.4,4120.4, Option to be mama baby. What is all right
4122.48,4124.0, Actually here's one that I kind of like
4125.2,4133.76," And I didn't cut and paste anybody's name so I apologize, but this was on the on the message boards and thank you anonymous reader for asking"
4135.04,4140.0, Said something I've always wondered are you guys like awesome with playing games in general
4140.56,4144.72, Like to kind you go into a CS game and dominate like 42 points in five rounds
4145.2,4149.84, If so is this related to how much time he's been playing countless shooters and RPGs and just get used to them?
4151.04,4155.44, I'm wondering because I play a lot of shooters and I'm not bad but not very good at the same time
4155.5199999999995,4159.92, So is there hope for someone of my skill to make it into the video game journalism field?
4162.16,4164.16, Nothing at two parter
4164.16,4167.04," Yeah, I'm not even gonna attempt because I can't write"
4167.92,4172.8," Okay, there you go and so of course that would be the big answer of course would be to learn how to write"
4173.76,4177.4400000000005, Well the other answer'd be that a lot of people that do this aren't really that good
4177.84,4181.68," Right, I right that's what I was gonna say is all right goody games or writing right I"
4182.320000000001,4184.320000000001, And you're kind of yeah baton zero
4184.72,4187.360000000001, But but I tend to kind of mostly suck
4188.0,4193.28," I just actually love them, but I still play everything I can and I shouldn't say that there's certain genres"
4194.16,4199.68, That I can play very well and that consider myself very good at but there's others that I like
4200.64,4202.64, And in genres that I would even review
4203.52,4207.52, But I'm not particularly an expert. I don't think that that disqualifies you
4208.56,4210.56, You know
4211.12,4217.200000000001," I certainly would not hold a very well on a counter strike server. Yeah, what's all specialties? I mean like yeah"
4217.200000000001,4224.320000000001, Shons like the savon for that there's mastery too where like you can you can not be the best but you cannot you can know something really well too
4224.320000000001,4229.6," Yeah, I think it's a that's right. It's a matter of literacy. I think I know there are people like I mean the kind of games"
4229.6,4231.6, I think about we're like skill like really
4232.08,4237.200000000001," No, I'm thinking like twitch stuff like shooters. Yeah, I love fighting games too before that"
4237.52,4241.200000000001, I mean I knew there would be people that would would know like the system was on fighting games
4241.200000000001,4245.52, The stuff but they wouldn't really be able to apply it themselves. They'd follow it up on the hard core boards
4245.52,4246.56, stuff and so there's there's
4247.52,4254.400000000001, There's that there yeah that that one side of it though. I mean that's like one of the more common letters that I've gotten for years and years
4254.400000000001,4255.6, It's like you know
4255.6,4259.200000000001, I'm great at games. How can I get into your field and like well?
4259.68,4263.4400000000005," Those are too totally different. That's the worst thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
4264.08,4273.04," There's other official gaming first like a lot of people who are in great games. Yeah, but you don't have to be great to be in this business"
4273.04,4277.84," Yeah, I mean I'm just about hardly I'm fairly average. I mean I just like I'm"
4278.72,4282.160000000001, Sometimes I'm really on sometimes I'm really off but that's not like there's
4283.200000000001,4285.6, Really good at Mario Kart that doesn't really help me
4286.08,4287.6, I
4287.6,4292.400000000001, I always wanted to be like the group of people I played with I mean I usually always was the best
4292.64,4296.56," Yeah, good start off with you know what I mean it was because it was just a small fish"
4296.56,4298.56, I mean it was just a small pond so it was easy here
4298.56,4302.64, Big fish and like the house and little bit of college and then online came out and I was like
4303.360000000001,4308.240000000001, I was like I'm still good. I'm like that's like but then you're even but then it's big enough
4308.240000000001,4312.08, Where no matter how good you are you're gonna end up in some place and someone will like humble you
4312.64,4316.72," So thoroughly yeah, you're like okay, I really don't even know this game"
4317.84,4323.84, But like I'm up into it. I mean I'm confident like any average person like I've said anyone that works in the industry like
4324.24,4329.28," I bet on myself that sounds cocky, but just like it is probably a fair chance depending on the game"
4329.6,4333.8, Like not on you know not on RTS or turn-based or something although I do like turn-based
4333.8,4337.5199999999995," I think it's a good one because like yeah, I would play a lot of those against my friends"
4337.84,4342.56, Like on a you know a land and then like as soon as the online RTS started becoming popular
4342.56,4345.92, I did it's did not learn the correct right the bills order
4346.160000000001,4351.360000000001," Right right and then I just like would get reem constantly and yeah, it's not because I suck is it"
4351.68,4354.88, Right or is it just because I didn't memorize the certain way to do things right?
4354.88,4358.88, There's really exploiting something and it's just a different level one like
4359.52,4364.400000000001, Exploiter significant piece of knowledge will make all the difference and that's why it's like all that's her off the moment you go
4364.400000000001,4367.360000000001," Yeah, there's the moment you go like into a real"
4367.52,4371.4400000000005," The big wide open online world, you know the best example I could think of recently"
4371.4400000000005,4376.8, So I was playing Supreme Commander and in that game you could set up your build order from the very beginning it into the very end of the game
4376.8,4378.0, Straight like straight from the get-go
4378.0,4380.0, Just start so
4380.0,4382.240000000001, If they figure out the right build path you are
4382.64,4384.64, Oh
4385.68,4388.64, Ryan are you good you good at ganking people
4389.76,4391.76, I saw you playing a little ultima
4392.160000000001,4397.120000000001, Run it away like I'm actually you're a gank anyway you run away like a bitch from a guy that chased you for good like 10 minutes
4397.52,4401.68, Put the hand off with it on you. I saw that man. Remember I can't work instead of your shoulder
4401.68,4406.0," Yeah, I just heard my character. I wasn't ready to fight yet. It was so rad is running"
4406.400000000001,4409.6, Right is running in this guy and a hole right on foot and he's just running
4410.080000000001,4411.68, It looks as Jake yes hell
4411.68,4416.400000000001, I was talking about a game that came out in 1997 right so the guy the horse is chasing him
4417.040000000001,4424.96," And I was like I saw I could tell Ryan just we should get talk shit, but he wasn't about to when he like wasn't as sure if it's like getting away with his like life"
4425.04,4429.76," In fact, he finally gets to this boat and he hops in a boat and I know he must be safe because immediately"
4429.76,4431.76, Tied type type type type type
4432.96,4436.4, You guys stay in there like looking empty can't get in the boat or whatever
4437.76,4442.2, But it wasn't that bad you were just complimenting him on his fighting prowess on his melee prowess or something
4442.72,4444.4, On his manhood
4444.4,4445.68, Ryan's like the most wicked
4446.4,4447.92, I'm talking about
4447.92,4449.92, No character is why
4449.92,4451.6, You just take it in the set one
4452.24,4453.6, Ryan no
4453.92,4458.360000000001, Straight back getting chased by a pk and you know if though good is hell to talk shit
4458.360000000001,4459.84," Oh, that guy wants you escaped right"
4459.84,4460.88, Carport car
4460.88,4462.88, Like if he
4463.4400000000005,4465.4400000000005, If he killed you it wouldn't have been fun
4466.0,4468.0," Yeah, not fun at all"
4468.0,4473.360000000001," You're here call them out. Okay, we'll read another question here again. Sorry. I don't have your name"
4473.84,4475.52, But good question
4475.52,4479.68, I would like to know your thoughts on the recent released geometry wars for Vista
4480.320000000001,4488.0, Not so much about the game itself but the fact that it's a Vista only release especially considering there's already a hacked version with the OS check removed
4488.0,4490.56, And the game will play perfectly fine on XP
4490.96,4493.68, Does it make sense for MS to release Gw
4494.0,4499.04, Geumtourists for Vista only when they could have released a version that runs on both Vista and XP
4500.64,4505.360000000001, I think it's awesome that we have the idea of who yours and I would like to know where to find it fact version
4506.0,4512.599999999999," Well, I'm gonna be a total dick and I'm gonna say there's a bunch of free games out right now that do the same thing as geometry wars that basically"
4512.599999999999,4514.639999999999, Just emulate geometry wars gameplay
4514.639999999999,4519.44, Geumtourists game play is basically ripping off robotron right right with funky griff funky or graphics
4519.44,4523.719999999999, So I mean it was only natural for someone else to do the same thing right I mean if you get this
4524.44,4525.08, You know
4525.08,4530.04, You can't the show there's a whole bunch of if you if you if you just do a quick Google search for like grid wars or
4530.92,4533.08, X wars or there's a bunch of versions
4533.08,4538.76, Such a weird game to pick as like a Vista only game just like everything
4538.76,4541.0, But out for Xbox live for arcade
4542.04,4544.04, It came with it came with a
4544.28,4551.34, 360's thing right no you have to buy it was a download. Okay. It was hexic note was the famous right now the thing is I mean
4551.34,4556.34," Yeah, they could have and should they have I don't know put it on XP"
4556.34,4559.84, But like it seems pretty clear now that their strategy is just gonna be
4560.64,4566.92," Upgrade to our goddamn new operating system right you know, you can't do anything to encourage you at this point to keep XP"
4567.56,4569.76," I think it seems pretty clear. Yeah, you know"
4570.4800000000005,4572.4800000000005, They're not gonna make it easier for you
4573.32,4575.32, Just keep going with XP
4575.76,4578.52, Let's suck it up isn't direct X 10 and not though
4579.08,4581.08, Our gamers well not yet
4581.08,4587.32, Is it a way when you they start getting established that's gonna be the only you're not gonna need to give people any more encouragement
4587.32,4592.259999999999," Well, true right they're trying to think of stuff they could do right now and in the immediate time frame"
4592.259999999999,4597.66, I think they don't you feel like they're kind of saying like in a way like XP is dead. It's dead to us
4598.04,4600.04," Yeah, that they're sort of saying that"
4600.28,4603.84," Like no, we're not gonna make it backwards compatible because we don't give a fuck about XP"
4604.16,4606.16, We're on Vista now
4606.16,4612.639999999999," Right, I guess in some ways like so you released a game for the Xbox 360 that totally could have been on the Xbox"
4612.64,4618.780000000001," I mean, is anyone yeah if you if you use that logic or you're gonna say well how come you didn't put it on Xbox"
4619.280000000001,4623.96, I did they want to sell their new operating system right if people aren't buying it that's their problem
4623.96,4628.6," No, they state and it is their problem. They need to convince more of us to upgrade"
4630.56,4632.56, So yeah
4632.56,4638.160000000001, Sounds like if the dude really wants to play he's found a way sounds like he has family. Yep. That he has
4638.16,4641.72, That's how saying the game isn't fun. It's a lot of fun
4642.96,4649.0199999999995, I played a lot of that it's very it's very like like Zen hypnotic is just kind of like run around the screen
4649.0199999999995,4651.82, Shoot's all because of the stupid achievement. That's not a good argument again
4652.32,4658.0," The achievement argument yeah, but again the only reason I get playing is because I saw someone else had a higher score on my friends"
4658.0,4662.139999999999," Well, at least now we're gonna get the painted get achievements on our own play place of"
4662.14,4664.14, One
4666.700000000001,4671.18, Any more questions and one was kind of kind of Petered out the hood that took the whole conversation
4673.18,4677.700000000001, It sounded good when I when I was looking at let me see what we're gonna deal with
4678.14,4684.88," Would you guys actually publish an article written by GFW for a member is a good one? Well, we know that actually haven't we yeah"
4684.88,4687.38," Oh, my well, well, yeah, we and and Rory"
4688.3,4690.3," Man, it was done a few"
4690.3,4697.9800000000005," Reviews of mods comes from the forums yep, so the answers yes, you can write and also Terran Nelson snug"
4698.5,4701.66, Snugs that's an article. I don't want to
4702.38,4704.38, Now like in that area
4704.38,4707.66," Yeah, so they have a whole pile of like submissions"
4707.66,4709.860000000001, But but really that's how I mean that's how it goes
4709.860000000001,4713.66, I mean when people ask you know how you have people end up writing for the magazine. I have no
4714.860000000001,4718.28, I mean you'll you'll hear you know a lot of people saying that you've got to have
4718.84,4723.24, Contacts or you have to know someone and you have to be friends with someone and hang out in the IRS
4723.24,4729.28," And yeah, yeah, all it takes is one sample like my you know one of our one of our one of my favorite freelancers that we have"
4729.92,4734.04, We just got just sent me a dry sample at the blue you know didn't yep
4734.04,4736.36," No, I've never heard his name and I looked at it and I was like"
4737.0,4741.48," Okay, I could deal with this you know send him right back and then then right first every month since"
4742.44,4745.679999999999," It like yeah, I mean that's kind of how I kind of just sent"
4746.599999999999,4747.88, You know
4748.12,4752.92, My own samples in and that's how I ended up doing this and I didn't know anyone didn't know single person in it
4752.92,4758.28," Yeah, it's such a sample. It also like you know, so also ideas if you have an idea for a story and you can and you can write that"
4758.28,4763.56, So this this the sample does for me. There is no I have samples on important me is yet to prove that you can well
4763.56,4765.56," A lot of people have ideas, but can't deliver"
4765.56,4770.12, But I mean like you have to have both I mean like in at least for me like when I'm looking for feet for feature writers or something
4770.12,4772.76," Yeah, have you an idea to bring to the table? You know, we could definitely like a"
4772.76,4777.320000000001, Evolved or something but you know writing is key. I don't want to spend my weekend at re-enitting your stuff
4777.320000000001,4782.6, And but but at the same time don't want to make it sound like an American dream or anyone could do it because it obviously
4783.400000000001,4788.92," I mean the big fact that they're impressing us could be really difficult, you know, yeah and in order to do it"
4788.92,4791.4800000000005, I mean you have to have been writing like like someone
4792.4400000000005,4798.12, a certain magazine just closed and one of their writers sent me a submission and he did an idea of just how thorough
4798.92,4800.76, People looking for this kind of work are though
4801.72,4808.280000000001, Had a whole story fleshed out here's exactly the angle here's the context that I'm gonna draw on here's basically the dimensions of it
4808.280000000001,4813.88, How many words I need to do it? Here's my experience doing these sorts of things and you look something like that as an editor
4814.2,4818.68," You like okay, here's the proof that they can write I mean here's some samples attached to it"
4819.16,4824.04," It's already they've already done the organization or approved that they've got the sting all the all the ducks lined up, you know"
4824.04,4828.280000000001, It's like great sounds sense perfect. Let's go ahead and do it and and be happy to see it
4828.759999999999,4831.16, The final product two weeks or whatever three weeks
4832.2,4837.88," I mean that's they also involve knowing the editor and it's not necessarily knowing them personally, but like knowing what they're looking for like"
4838.44,4843.0," Okay, I know this magazine does this kind of thing. I know this editor has said you like this kind of story"
4843.0,4845.0," Yeah, they're part of it. Yeah, I mean"
4845.8,4846.44, I mean
4846.44,4849.639999999999," One person and they don't give a crap, but if you send it to someone else to make a business exactly"
4850.84,4854.44, You know knowing knowing knowing knowing the audience knowing your clients I guess
4855.08,4860.44, If you're in if you're in the experience writer and you just do some review and it's in like the game pro
4860.599999999999,4862.599999999999, I mean the game spot format or something
4863.08,4865.24, And you send it to another outlay I mean
4865.24,4868.839999999999, Totally it just throw it away immediately or just click delete
4868.839999999999,4875.32, I mean that's what I'll do like if I see something and it might only take it like two sentences in and I might I'm ready all time
4875.32,4876.759999999999," I got a hand over the delete key, you know"
4876.759999999999,4878.759999999999," Yeah, so that to give you an idea"
4878.759999999999,4882.28, It's easy because you don't need any connections
4882.28,4886.04," You don't necessarily need to agree or anything you just need to good sample, but that's how"
