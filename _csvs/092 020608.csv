4.48,9.42, fear extraction point and fear-pursious mandate together in one box.
9.42,14.200000000000001," Experience new weapons, new enemies, new missions, and brand new multiplayer maps."
14.200000000000001,16.92, It's twice the fear in one box.
16.92,21.080000000000002, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio.
21.080000000000002,26.32, This is the podcast for February 6th 2008.
26.8,33.76," Yeah, I'm saying that questioningly because we're recording on February 4th, we won't be here February 5th"
33.76,36.0, so you'll get it on February 6th.
36.0,37.76, Super Wednesday.
37.76,38.6, Good math.
38.6,41.84," The day after Super Tuesday, today being super Monday."
41.84,44.28," Every day, super, when you're with games for Windows."
44.28,45.28," Oh, that's right."
45.28,47.480000000000004, And it was super Sunday.
47.480000000000004,51.68," Wow, every day's just super, super weak."
51.68,53.56, I don't feel super Ryan.
53.56,55.36, I feel super.
55.36,56.36, Hi.
56.36,61.48," This is Jeff Green, the editor in chief of games for Windows and I'm here with two of these"
61.48,64.28, three usual gang of idiots and they are.
64.28,65.28, Ryan Scott.
65.28,66.28," And Sean, I'm a lawyer."
66.28,67.28, That's right.
67.28,69.76, We're without Sean Elliott today.
69.76,73.88, And we don't have a fourth chair to fill that void so we'll see what happens here.
73.88,76.76, Does anyone know where Sean actually is?
76.76,77.76, We know he's on vacation.
77.76,79.76," See, I didn't even know he was going on vacation."
79.76,80.76, He's an ironed boss.
80.76,81.76, Is that it?
81.76,82.76, I think so.
82.76,83.76, Really?
83.76,84.76, Did he tell anybody?
85.2,88.2, I asked him where he was going and then he gave a really vague secret response.
88.2,89.2, I heard that from him.
89.2,90.2, I heard from him.
90.2,91.2, I heard from him.
91.2,92.2, I heard from him.
92.2,93.2, I heard from him.
93.2,94.2, I heard from him.
94.2,95.2, I heard from him.
95.2,96.2, He didn't tell you directly.
96.2,97.2, He told no one worry was going on the stage.
97.2,100.0," I asked him and he said, I'm going to go hang out with my friend, Homes, another."
100.0,101.0, Okay.
101.0,102.0, I could have known.
102.0,103.0, He couldn't really be mistaken.
103.0,104.0, I don't know so.
104.0,105.0, Let's perpetuate that rumor.
105.0,106.0, Okay.
106.0,109.04, He said it's a lie with Homes.
109.04,110.04, Okay.
110.04,112.64, Detective work right there.
112.64,113.64, Alright.
113.64,117.18," Yeah, why you don't get a Hawaii."
117.18,121.04, This is something to be said for my leadership here when I didn't want to.
121.04,124.6," When he, I didn't even know he was going on vacation."
124.6,126.48," You know, he eventually told you."
126.48,132.84, I was thinking about that just today because I was looking at election stuff because it's
132.84,137.0, super Tuesday tomorrow though it will have been yesterday by the time everybody hears this.
137.0,139.44, Not to go into politics at all because we don't want to do that.
139.44,148.2," But I did note for the record that I am the same age as Barack Obama, which is a little"
148.2,149.56, shocking to me.
149.56,150.56, Why is that?
150.56,153.28, Do you think you were younger or older?
153.28,159.68," I, I would have just thought I was younger than anyone actually running for president."
159.68,162.32," And it makes me, makes me wonder what I've done with my life."
162.32,163.76, You could run for president.
163.76,165.16," Yeah, I don't think so."
165.16,166.92," See that's, that's my whole point."
166.92,169.35999999999999, I can't even really manage a staff of five.
169.35999999999999,171.67999999999998," I'm like, I'm all country."
171.67999999999998,173.35999999999999, I don't even want to my own.
173.35999999999999,176.64," The editors is gone for a week and I'm like, oh really?"
176.64,181.16," So, you know, what if that was like, you know, the defense department that'd be a problem."
181.16,182.44, Isn't that kind of how it works?
182.44,186.11999999999998," It's a president that defense department wasn't here this week, you know, that'd be a"
186.11999999999998,187.11999999999998, fight.
187.11999999999998,188.11999999999998, I think you're actually quite suited to be.
188.11999999999998,190.92," I, yeah, really actually probably do have former presidents."
190.92,193.88," You're going to delegating responsibility, Jeff."
193.88,196.04, That's what it is.
196.04,197.04, That includes.
197.04,198.88," You have to, to turn this into a strength."
198.88,203.84," Speaking of which, but when people hear this podcast on Wednesday, I want to have found"
203.84,208.76," out this is a little bit of time travel, but on that day, I want to find out that you"
208.76,211.04, Ryan will have actually voted.
211.04,212.44," Oh, God."
212.44,216.64," Which we won't, which we won't have known because the way you're talking at launch is like,"
216.64,218.92, you're like talking about another country.
218.92,219.92," Oh, I'm one of those."
219.92,220.92, This is concerning.
220.92,223.2," Yeah, when do we decide what everyone picked?"
223.2,225.92," It was, yeah, when they, when do they decide?"
225.92,227.48," I kind of, what do you mean?"
227.48,232.51999999999998," They, you know, the country who thinks my vote doesn't matter."
232.51999999999998,234.48," So I, every vote matters."
234.48,237.35999999999999," Ryan, I have voted in the past, but it's very rare."
237.35999999999999,240.0, See if everybody thought the way you did.
240.0,243.2," Everybody, you're not going to vote."
243.2,244.2, I can tell.
244.2,246.11999999999998," The majority of people don't vote, right?"
246.11999999999998,247.27999999999997, Yeah.
247.27999999999997,248.27999999999997, But they should.
248.27999999999997,250.27999999999997," In fact, if you're listening to, well, no, I can't tell."
250.27999999999997,252.27999999999997, And it's part of the same majority.
252.27999999999997,255.67999999999998," Well, you don't have to be."
255.68,259.6," Not playing for like 10 minutes tomorrow, whatever you're playing and go vote."
259.6,260.6, Okay.
260.6,263.0," I'm even care who you vote for, doesn't matter."
263.0,264.8, Or it's not even the issue.
264.8,265.8, You vote.
265.8,268.64," And power yourself, young man."
268.64,269.64, I don't know.
269.64,271.76, There's something to be said for not voting.
271.76,274.6," If you have no freaking clue, what's your voting for?"
274.6,275.6, Yeah.
275.6,276.6, That's me.
276.6,277.6," Well, like, okay."
277.6,278.6, I think you should be on it.
278.6,279.6, Be an educated voter.
279.6,282.04, That's the best thing you can do.
282.04,284.2," Don't just go on the voting, but because you have to."
284.2,285.2, Right.
285.2,286.2, I don't know.
286.2,287.2, Yeah.
287.2,292.2," Fortunately, I think a lot of people do do that."
292.2,293.2, Yeah.
293.2,294.2, Yeah.
294.2,298.88, I do skip the ones that I realize I haven't read about when there's some proposition.
298.88,303.71999999999997, Because if all I know is never know the back and forth and commercials that you usually
303.71999999999997,304.71999999999997, might not.
304.71999999999997,305.71999999999997, Yeah.
305.71999999999997,306.71999999999997, That one.
306.71999999999997,308.71999999999997, I just have no idea what that one's all about.
308.71999999999997,309.71999999999997, Yeah.
309.71999999999997,313.96," Obviously, two sides are very, very, very, very into it though."
313.96,314.96, Yes.
315.0,315.96, Yeah.
315.96,316.79999999999995, We got the whole gambling thing.
316.79999999999995,318.2, I can't make heads or tail of that.
318.2,319.59999999999997, That's no clue.
319.59999999999997,321.91999999999996, Every commercial is about that one.
321.91999999999996,325.03999999999996, And it's obviously very important to both sides otherwise they won't be
325.03999999999996,326.68, thrown so much money into it.
326.68,327.68, Right.
327.68,328.68, And arrows.
328.68,330.68, They're calling each other names nonstop.
330.68,331.67999999999995, So there's some.
331.67999999999995,332.67999999999995, Yeah.
332.67999999999995,334.67999999999995, I don't know.
334.67999999999995,337.52," Anyway, hope you voted or not."
337.52,339.0, Right.
339.0,342.28," And I'm talking, and I mean, you, Ryan, I hope you voted."
342.28,343.28, Okay.
343.28,345.47999999999996, Have I shamed you into it yet in public now?
345.47999999999996,346.47999999999996, Maybe.
346.47999999999996,349.32, To grab this is going up one.
349.32,350.32, Damn it.
350.32,351.32, All right.
351.32,353.84, So have we been playing games?
353.84,354.84, So we talked about games.
354.84,357.44, We've been playing while Shawn's out of the office.
357.44,361.59999999999997," I mean, talking about stuff that we actually like and we won't be made fun of."
361.59999999999997,363.79999999999995, I'm such a big one.
363.79999999999995,364.79999999999995, He is.
364.79999999999995,365.79999999999995, That can be cry.
365.79999999999995,372.23999999999995," Mr. Milite, did you get a sense of a solar empire?"
372.24,375.68," Yeah, I was going to talk about that last week."
375.68,376.68, Awesome.
376.68,379.48," Decided for some reason, I don't even know why that it couldn't."
379.48,381.6, It's one of the one of the great names I think.
381.6,382.6, I love that name.
382.6,385.8, That it's like the geekiest name of the game I've ever heard.
385.8,387.8, It needs to be made into a soap opera.
387.8,388.8, So think.
388.8,390.8, Since the solar empire.
390.8,394.64," Last week, both of you guys had been playing that, right?"
394.64,395.64, You started.
395.64,396.64, I started this weekend.
396.64,398.28000000000003, We were kind of doing the tutorials and try it a little.
398.35999999999996,402.0, I played the tutorials on Saturday.
402.0,405.28, I got overwhelmed with it as I thought I might.
405.28,407.28, It is pretty overwhelming.
407.28,412.76," In fact, I was on one of yours last week and we were having a discussion on that podcast"
412.76,418.35999999999996, about the complexity of PC strategy games.
418.35999999999996,426.35999999999996," Shane, Bettenhausen, and Brian, into Har made a joke about the tech trees in games like that."
426.36,431.44," At very day when I got back to my desk, I had the box copy of Sins of the Solar Empire"
431.44,433.76, and inside the box where you've seen it.
433.76,435.36, There's a poster.
435.36,438.24, Two-sided poster that's all the tech tree.
438.24,442.24, It was such a great visual joke because it's exactly what those guys were talking about.
442.24,446.44, I walked over to the EGM side of the building and held it up and they both screamed.
446.44,447.44, It's pretty daunting.
447.44,449.72, It is very daunting.
449.72,455.84000000000003," When you start the game, the interface just at first glance and looking at the tutorial,"
455.84,457.84," I mean, they're shit everywhere."
457.84,462.88, There's a million numbers and tabs and your whole empire on the left side of the screen
462.88,463.88, and all that.
463.88,469.35999999999996," If you're not at the point where I loaded it up, I had already played burnout paradise for"
469.35999999999996,470.35999999999996, like three hours.
470.35999999999996,472.96, My brain was adequately numbed.
472.96,473.96, This is really similar.
473.96,476.15999999999997, It's a fast racing dumbness.
476.15999999999997,479.2," I just was like, oh, and I put it away."
479.2,480.91999999999996," On Sunday, I was more in the mood."
480.91999999999996,485.76, I was fully caffeinated and well rested and in the mood for something heavier.
486.32,492.4," Then I was amazed by how actually accessible it was, given all that."
492.4,494.71999999999997," I'm going to say, I actually took the time to learn it."
494.71999999999997,499.24," I've got to say, I had the same preconception like the screen shots and like doing the previous"
499.24,505.12, before we actually got the builds in and that it was going to be a terrifying daunting experience
505.12,506.76," because that empire tree, the thing on the left side."
506.76,510.59999999999997," Yeah, that's the one that worried me because it has lots of collapsible triangles and"
510.59999999999997,513.96, like just looking at just like row upon row of these little icons.
513.96,519.0400000000001, But I got to say for like how much is going on here that interface is pretty darn brilliant.
519.0400000000001,520.2, It's pretty brilliant.
520.2,521.2, I agree with you.
521.2,521.48, Yeah.
521.48,527.88," I mean, by the time I was into a real game and I, you know, I told you earlier before"
527.88,532.84, we podcast said that I was playing like the smallest map right on only two stars.
532.84,533.84," Well, plan that's right."
533.84,538.96, And even that I quit after like almost three hours.
538.96,539.96, The game was an over.
539.96,542.52, But I was thoroughly enjoying it the entire time.
542.6,549.96," But but by the end of that game, I realized without really being conscious of it that"
549.96,557.12," I like fully I won't say mastered, but I had a full grasp of of that entire empire, you know,"
557.12,562.0799999999999, interface that I was able to freely go back and forth between my planets and the ships.
562.0799999999999,566.0," And I really totally knew what I was doing, which I wouldn't have thought I would be able"
566.0,567.4399999999999, to do a few hours before that.
567.4399999999999,570.0," Yeah, they really did a great job."
570.0,573.08, It's also got the way it's crawls in and out.
573.08,574.08, It's really elegant.
574.08,575.08, Yeah.
575.08,579.72," Like, because I think it defaults to just scrolling and zooming in, it's got the Supreme Commander"
579.72,582.24, kind of interface where the closer you are.
582.24,584.88," If you're really close, it shows all the actual 3D models of everything."
584.88,589.48," And if you zoom way out, you can look at all five stars and all their planets altogether"
589.48,591.48, in one mini map.
591.48,592.48," Yeah, exactly."
592.48,596.04, You get a change just for the ships to icons and your colonies to icons and everything
596.04,597.04, just makes life.
597.12,601.28, It actually makes a lot more sense to be using it in this game than it didn't Supreme
601.28,602.28, Commander.
602.28,605.88, It just seems like you are managing things on these two levels.
605.88,610.76," Like, they're these very very tightly controlled like RTS battles, which you can actually"
610.76,612.8, not really tightly control the eyes pretty smart.
612.8,618.8," And then the big, very much like galactic civilization too, like, overview kind of thing."
618.8,624.16, And yet it didn't feel daunting either way to go back and forth between the two actually
624.16,627.0, felt very natural.
627.0,630.72, The second Supreme Commander will just in terms of that camera where that seemed like
630.72,636.52," kind of a neat gimmick here, it seems like a total necessity."
636.52,639.56, But it's so easy to use.
639.56,640.56, Were we going to ask?
640.56,641.56, You've had a question.
641.56,643.88," So I was going to say, does it other than the Supreme Commander stuff you're talking"
643.88,644.88, about?
644.88,649.72," I mean, is it comparable to any of the other big strategy games out there?"
649.72,651.2," Well, I mean, what?"
651.2,655.04," I mean, this is very, very, very much like galactic civilization."
655.04,656.04, Yeah.
657.04,661.76," And I guess, you know, if you get on the, uh, to close up planet Terry level where you're"
661.76,666.12," actually flying your ships around in real time and shooting each other, it's kind of like"
666.12,667.12, homeral.
667.12,668.12, Right.
668.12,674.24," So think of like, homeral meets galactic civilization meets, uh, geez, I'd starcraft"
674.24,676.56," would not be, would not be accurate."
676.56,682.28," Not, but I mean, but it's got real time that's got the three sides to it and right complementary."
682.28,685.16," The, uh, the real time aspect of it."
685.16,690.0799999999999," And I think is what really puts us over into like, like super accessible territory."
690.0799999999999,695.16," I mean, I think for for gamers and strategy fans who like never could quite make the leap"
695.16,701.36," into a forex game, um, that like this really could almost be like a gateway to that kind"
701.36,705.48," of game, just because, um, because you're getting the total complexity."
705.48,707.92," I mean, and we're talking super complex."
707.92,710.28, Like you were telling me stuff this morning.
710.28,711.92, I had no idea it was even in the game.
711.92,712.92," Oh, yeah."
712.92,713.92, The pirate writers.
713.92,714.92, Yeah.
715.68,718.3199999999999," I mean, I know I've only scratched the surface completely."
718.3199999999999,722.92," And it even the little that I, that I felt I had a grasp on, which is probably like 20%"
722.92,729.16," of the game was already deeper than than most other real time strategy games I've played recently,"
729.16,730.16, like in the years.
730.16,733.04," So you're, you're getting kind of the depth of the forex games."
733.04,735.8399999999999, And yet the pace keeps moving because of it.
735.8399999999999,741.8399999999999," Yeah, the pace is awesome because you could, it takes minutes and minutes and minutes"
741.84,744.76, for a fleet travel from one end of the galaxy to the other.
744.76,748.76," But you're actually like, if you say, okay, I'm going to invade this planet over here."
748.76,752.0, You're actually enjoy the break as they're traveling to the phase lanes.
752.0,754.88," Because it takes what you do is you select, select a flage."
754.88,755.4, You can just do this.
755.4,759.0," You just click on the, what I do is I just click on the planet where my fleet happens"
759.0,760.6, to be sitting in the Empire window.
760.6,763.84, And then you just right click on a planet you want them to go to.
763.84,768.48," And then you can set them together, jump all together through the phase lanes."
768.48,770.64," So if they get to the edge of a planet, he's gravity well."
770.64,773.04, What they'll do is look on a hyper space basically.
773.04,776.96, And then they're totally untouchable while they travel between the gravity well as a planet.
776.96,781.4399999999999, So you don't control the units kind of in dead space.
781.4399999999999,786.96, You rightly just control them in these interconnected circular zones or spherical zones actually.
786.96,787.96, Right.
787.96,792.08," And while they're traveling to the phase lanes are untouchable and you kind of like,"
792.08,797.56, you'll learn to use that time to do other stuff and manage all the other colonies that you've kind of been made.
797.56,798.76, And there's plenty to do.
798.76,799.76, Yeah.
800.0,803.68," Well, that's the other thing we were talking about this morning was that all the things you need to do,"
803.68,805.84," like managing your resources and stuff,"
805.84,810.96, there's like at least it feels like three different ways to do every single thing.
810.96,816.48," So, you know, if you need to collect crystal one of the resources,"
816.48,820.08," you can actually go to the asteroid where the crystals and tell it, you know,"
820.08,828.0," tell your fleet to build an extractor there or you can go to the structure that actually builds the,"
828.16,829.76, build the extractors.
829.76,836.08," I mean, there's this like, I just really appreciated the way that you weren't forced to memorize one way to do things."
836.08,836.4, Right.
836.4,839.76," Like any way you could think of doing it, it was there."
839.76,841.52," So, back to those pirate writers."
841.52,845.12," So one of the things, back to the pirate writers."
845.12,849.2," One of the things that the game does at the beginning of the game, this is really important."
849.2,853.2," And actually, you can make your break a game early on if you're pulling this against a couple of people."
853.2,857.2," What you do is, uh, and most maps, and you can actually,"
857.2,861.9200000000001," you know, randomly generate a map or there's a whole bunch of premades scenarios."
863.5200000000001,866.24, There's like a pirate outpost at one of the stars somewhere.
866.24,872.96," And, uh, there's every 20 minutes, you'll, the game announced, he will say, pirate,"
872.96,878.32," pirate, pirate, imminent, at which point you can kind of get into a bidding war to see who the"
878.32,879.6800000000001, pirates are going to go after.
879.6800000000001,882.8000000000001," So, uh, if the way it works is that this bounty system they call it, you go to this"
883.2800000000001,888.24," bounty screen and uh, you just click on one of your enemy's names and anonymously put down"
888.24,889.9200000000001, a certain amount of credits that you want.
889.9200000000001,893.6," So other players, including these pirates, can collect the bounty by going to kill them."
893.6,896.32," So if you kill a player ship and his bounty on it, you get that money."
896.32,898.72, So it's kind of a cool way to add and know about any of this.
898.72,900.96," Yeah, there's this kind of a really pirate way to go."
900.96,903.84, So what the fuck is with all these pirates all the time?
903.84,904.32, Mm-hmm.
904.32,906.48, That's all I wasn't even fighting the other enemy.
907.12,910.0," Right, yeah, these these, these gray guys coming in to kill you."
910.0,910.32, Yeah.
910.32,911.6800000000001," And you're like, oh, what's going on?"
911.68,912.64, Yeah.
912.64,916.64," But it's kind of a cool way to, um, I guess put a bounty on someone else's head without"
916.64,919.68," actually, dealing anyone that it's you doing it."
919.68,919.92, Yeah.
919.92,923.28," It's a good way if you're like, taking up early on and do like a economy"
923.28,925.12, trees rather than the hostility trees.
925.12,926.7199999999999, So you're not making new missiles.
926.7199999999999,929.52," You're making, you know, different ways to make your ore production better."
929.52,930.4, Mm-hmm.
930.4,933.8399999999999, It's a good way to kind of convert that to early attacks.
933.8399999999999,938.24," So you can kind of fend off a player who might be, you know, building up their hostility"
938.32,941.52, trees without actually building up your own little army.
941.52,944.96, But it can totally backfire someone beats you in the bounty game.
945.6,945.92, Right.
945.92,948.88," The way it works is when you get that warning that the pirates are coming,"
948.88,951.44," it's like a, the little thing starts flashing red."
951.44,955.04, And then you have a completely randomized amount of time before they actually launch.
955.04,957.76," It's like something like 30 seconds to a minute, but it always changes."
957.76,964.0, So you just go to the screen and just watch other players add money to the pool against you
964.0,965.04, or against someone else.
965.04,967.6800000000001," And then if like it looks like you're about to be attacked, you quickly"
968.72,970.08, try to get on there and eat bay.
970.08,971.28, It's very much like eBay.
971.28,975.92," Which is kind of weird because you have to go into this really giant interface screen,"
975.92,977.76, the blocks everything for about 30 seconds.
977.76,981.76," So kind of feel like, it kind of takes over your whole world while you're trying it."
981.76,984.0, Because you don't want to be beaten and you don't want the timer to go off.
984.0,986.32," You can't do like when you're using buy it now, sort of thing."
986.32,988.32," No, you can't set like a kill them now."
988.32,989.6, You can't set a reserve price.
991.6,992.16, That would be nice.
993.2,995.28," But it's really, that's the wind button."
995.28,996.24, I win.
998.24,1001.92, But it can really mess you up if you're attacked early on because you can spend a lot of money.
1003.2,1006.48," Just fending off pirate raiders while the other player is going,"
1006.48,1007.52," ah, ha ha ha."
1007.52,1008.8, Like collecting planets.
1008.8,1011.92," Yeah, that's kind of the kind of game I had."
1011.92,1013.12, I still enjoyed it.
1013.12,1014.72, If you just didn't know any better.
1014.72,1019.12," If you're ready for them, you can actually kind of use them like in Warcraft 3"
1019.12,1022.72, in like the creeps kind of way like level up your capital ships because your
1022.72,1024.72, capital ships basically act as hero units.
1024.72,1025.2," Oh, right."
1025.2,1026.48, Just one of those games.
1026.48,1027.6, It's one of what do you mean?
1027.6799999999998,1029.52, I hated that part of Warcraft 3.
1029.52,1030.9599999999998," Well, there's not that much to it."
1030.9599999999998,1032.1599999999999," I mean, you're not making it hard."
1032.1599999999999,1036.3999999999999," Yeah, you're not like actively going to kill little packs of goblins just to get through levels."
1036.3999999999999,1039.04, And there's so much more to the gaming your capital ship.
1039.04,1040.0," Yeah, yeah, for sure."
1040.8799999999999,1045.04, Whereas the hero unit in Warcraft 3 was a huge part of your victory.
1045.04,1047.4399999999998," I mean, the capital ship's obviously important in this game."
1048.0,1050.7199999999998," But it's, yeah, I mean, it gets as important as you make it."
1051.1999999999998,1056.0," Yeah, you can, because that they give you options to like build up your"
1056.08,1061.52, capital ship fleet or your just your total unit count and your unit count can get
1061.52,1062.24, crazy.
1062.96,1066.24, And then I don't think I've ever gotten halfway through whenever I
1066.24,1070.4, already have like hundreds upon hundreds of ships just like in my fleet.
1070.4,1072.8, I can't even imagine what is like at the end of the game.
1073.84,1076.64," Yeah, I really end of a really big game."
1076.64,1082.08," I'm still very much at the beginning, but so far my impression is very positive."
1082.1599999999999,1087.12," This, I mean, it just seems like I can't think of the well, I guess probably"
1087.12,1091.28, Galsive 2's the last game that felt this deep and this much fun.
1092.0,1097.36, But this one to me is even more likely to like I would probably recommend this one first
1097.36,1102.48," two players who haven't played this kind of game before, just because I think the real time aspect"
1102.48,1106.48, of it keeps it going a little a little better.
1106.48,1107.12, Right.
1107.12,1110.6399999999999, It's less it's less daunting to play.
1110.72,1112.3200000000002, And I think less likely to get boring.
1113.92,1118.88," Yeah. And then there's a yeah, the cool aspect is which I'm just kind of discovering now"
1118.88,1122.3200000000002, like the more you play the more thing you discover is because that's the nature of these kind of things.
1122.96,1125.5200000000002, It's just how cool culture is.
1125.5200000000002,1130.0, It's like you build these little media hubs in your planets that'll spread spread the message
1130.0,1132.64, over society across the phaseline. So you'll see these little creeping
1133.8400000000001,1139.44, colored lines kind of advance out and like slowly assimilate other other planets which is kind of cool.
1139.52,1142.64, Doesn't that affect does that affect economy like will that affect your
1142.64,1146.56, imposter economy if it's like it'll increase the
1147.76,1152.48, allegiance of your like planets are a little further away from your home right because
1152.48,1156.96, it the further away a planet is from your home planet less the less it brings in.
1156.96,1160.4," Yeah, the less allegiance it has and then that factors directly into how much"
1160.96,1165.28, you know the rate of its production. So you know you're not getting or in crystal as quickly as you
1165.36,1170.48, could be right. So those they they help the friendly planets be a little more friendly.
1170.48,1177.76, Right. You're right. You're genes in your movies and uh it also if it if you're uh
1179.04,1184.0, culture lines are hitting other enemy planets it'll lower their allegiance and eventually
1184.6399999999999,1189.04, it gets low enough they'll just kind of succeed and join your union. So that's kind of a way.
1189.04,1193.84, I haven't actually achieved a cultural victory because in galactic civilizations too it's actually
1194.72,1199.84, pretty easy not necessarily easy but actually totally viable to win without
1199.84,1206.0, Luigi and Warren necessarily. The games are long though. Yeah. Very very long.
1206.0,1212.56, Yeah. Which is unlike other RTSs so like you know you can do what are they talking 20 minutes
1212.56,1217.12, is like the target for a starcraft 2 game. A small one of these could take four or five hours.
1217.12,1222.32," Yeah, no seriously. Yeah, the the game I played yesterday was over three hours it was on the"
1222.3999999999999,1228.96, small snap and I wasn't nearly done. Yeah and it's great because you never like four hours into it.
1228.96,1234.32, You never feel like it might be over like you can't you know you can always feel like you can
1234.32,1239.12, come back right it's got a really great back and forth. Do you guys think that knowing what you
1239.12,1243.84, know about the game I mean if they were to introduce smaller maps then whenever the smallest they have
1243.84,1247.6, now I mean what it was B. I wouldn't want a smaller map like
1248.56,1255.36, the smallest map is like 14 planets which you really can only gather you know if you're going to
1255.36,1260.08, get seven planets it's really the only that is about the bare minimum for like an interesting
1260.08,1267.12, economy. Yeah and I don't know it's not like if you compare it to if you compare it to starcraft
1267.12,1271.6799999999998, obviously that's way long if you compare it to a collect civilizational two game or even a civilization
1271.6799999999998,1276.08, it's not long at all. You really almost have to compare it to it's more like that like a
1276.08,1282.1599999999999, civil game or a golf civil game. Yeah because it's really modeled more on that you know these are
1282.1599999999999,1289.6799999999998, gigantic world conquering games. You know I I mentioned to you I was reading the uh the
1289.6799999999998,1295.6799999999998, I've got forum on this game and and somebody's too word-posed was after some all these other people
1295.6799999999998,1303.12, were talking about this game was goodbye life. That was a really good map comment.
1303.6,1310.0, Think the biggest it gets is around I think five four or five star systems. Or is the
1310.0,1314.6399999999999, maximum and you can have like a dozen planets in the star systems or you're talking on the 60 maybe
1314.6399999999999,1319.52, even more than I don't know. That's so beyond what I could ever do. I had to go into my life.
1319.52,1324.0, I looked at those games and I was like well this is what I would have done in college. Right the
1324.0,1329.84, highest I've done is a force I've done a couple four star maps. Yeah with like I think the max move
1329.9199999999998,1335.04, six others societies and it's kind of cool because if you're playing playing it's other players
1335.04,1339.04, obviously you can make your own allegiances it will and make an outcome because they're dealing with
1339.04,1345.36, humans but if you're playing all against the AI they do a cool thing where other empires will
1345.36,1353.1999999999998, just send you missions as a hey launch go kill five of this guy's you know trading ships and
1353.1999999999998,1357.84, then your you know my allegiance will go up with you and then it will kind of be out like a wow quest.
1357.9199999999998,1361.6, So yeah they just randomly will like send you quests and they'll first conflict.
1362.1599999999999,1365.76, So one will say you know blow up five of his trade-erships while the other guy is saying
1365.76,1370.24, well I want you to go blow up you know five of his mining colonies or something like that.
1370.24,1374.9599999999998, Uh huh so you kind of so instead of just being at war with everyone right from the beginning you
1374.9599999999998,1380.6399999999999, can actually kind of make allegiances with the AI which is kind of right I haven't so far they've
1380.6399999999999,1385.04, worked out okay no one's ever one problem with the allegiances against with the AI is that you're
1385.12,1388.24, just assuming any second they're just going to break it and kill you.
1388.8799999999999,1394.6399999999999, And in my long history of playing games I almost have never made allegiances with anybody
1395.2,1398.0, in the AI no matter what the game is for that reason.
1398.56,1401.6, I feel like I usually make y'all out.
1402.24,1408.8, Well I usually I usually treat him as temporary okay I don't have to worry about these guys for now.
1408.8,1413.12," Yeah, worry about the purple guys instead of the blue guys so that front is kind of close"
1413.12,1417.28, it off at least until it's I'd change the mind. Right so at least it's one factor
1418.0,1422.4799999999998, kind of out of the equation. I always feel sort of guilty too when I have done it because then
1422.4799999999998,1426.8799999999999, when I do break it and then they send they're going to do it to you man. You get the message it's like
1426.8799999999999,1429.04, I thought we were friends. Oh my gosh shit.
1430.8799999999999,1436.9599999999998, They'll totally send flavor from world now. I'm sorry if you put a bounty or anyone puts a bounty
1436.9599999999998,1440.56, on one of the AI players and they happen to be the target of the pirate raid because they
1440.6399999999999,1442.8799999999999, have the most bounty against him. They'll send them as interesting.
1443.44,1447.76, That better not have been you if I find out that was you. I'm totally going to get you and I'm like
1447.76,1453.6, something they're going. Can you find out if that was me? I thought this is anonymous.
1454.8799999999999,1461.52," Trying to strike you out. Right. But yeah, red game. Yeah, I'm addicted. I also like that the"
1461.52,1465.9199999999998," phased jumps remind me very much of battle struggle. I took a, so that makes me feel good."
1466.0,1470.64," They make you feel good. They're cool to watch too. Yeah, they're cool to watch. It's really like"
1470.64,1476.4, I spend most of my time looking at it from the really likes to cheat Jake iconic view. But when you
1476.4,1481.52," do really zoom in and look at these battles, they're really cool to look at. Yeah, that that has"
1481.52,1486.8000000000002, not gotten old to me at all. There's all to be watching them from way far out. And then I'll think like
1486.8000000000002,1491.8400000000001," oh yeah, actually I could zoom in and see watch my capital ship destroying the enemy and it looks"
1491.9199999999998,1498.8," great. I mean, it's like homeworld level when you say like it. Yeah, but better now. I mean,"
1498.8,1504.56," because we're years later. So it looks good. Wait, is there an I evenly, when I am controlling"
1504.56,1509.36," micro managing a battle, I'll usually still use the Empire tree and say, okay, I want to grab"
1509.36,1512.72," all my illuminators, all this all to click on the illuminators because they're long range."
1513.36,1517.4399999999998, And I want them to hit these healing ships back there and I'll still just kind of use the icons I see.
1517.44,1523.6000000000001," Mm-hmm. So that am I mean, that is just brilliant. Yeah, really is the first time they showed that in"
1523.6000000000001,1529.8400000000001," the demo, I just was like, oh, what the fuck for that thing. Yep, I mean, that really works great. Yeah."
1529.8400000000001,1534.16," I mean, figuring out which ship is which is at first a little daunting because they aren't that"
1534.16,1538.88, different looking when you look at it. So run. This has got three prongs that are two exactly. Yeah.
1538.88,1543.92, But you eventually kind of learn where they are in the scheme of things. So you always know your
1543.92,1548.0, colony ship is like the last thing on the list. Mm-hmm. Your scout ships the second last thing.
1548.0,1551.92, So you can kind of grab in that way. Mm-hmm. It's just kind of like having like a clickable
1551.92,1557.68, legend or something. Mm-hmm. I don't know. I really like it. My problem is when you get more than
1557.68,1563.28," we'll fit on one screen, you have to scroll through. But then you can like pin them and unpin them."
1563.28,1566.64," So if a plan is kind of just doing its own thing and you don't really need to worry about it,"
1566.64,1570.0, you can kind of take it off the list for a while. There's even a search function.
1570.32,1575.2," Which is awesome. It is awesome. It is great. Yeah. Oh, I was like search function. I have to type it in."
1575.2,1579.12," But yeah, you just click search and then you're like search colony ships and it'll just all highlight all the"
1579.12,1584.24, colony ships. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. It's awesome. Yeah. Then you go click on it and it's like that.
1584.24,1587.92, It's just so you want how huge this frickin game is that they had to put a search in.
1588.8,1596.0," Where are my ships? I have no idea. Well, yeah. I said I usually just build a bunch of scouts like five at a time"
1596.0,1599.36, and then have them auto explorer. Like I don't really make my commandage my exploring.
1599.36,1602.96, It's interesting. That's a wild thing. Is that all the auto stuff works quite well.
1603.52,1608.8," No, what I was thinking, I was even the auto combat. I was compared. The other the last auto game,"
1609.52,1615.84, remember master Ryan 3 did you play 3? I did not play 3. I was scared off by 3. The problem with that game
1616.72,1622.48, was that it was so automated. You could hit n turn and win the game by doing that.
1623.2,1627.84, You just hit it over and over again. It was really. It was so it was over automated.
1627.84,1634.64, Like so much like it was all about that. That's like progress quest or something. Yeah. It was actually kind of like funny.
1634.64,1639.52, I was like really can I just hit n turn over and over and over. It's actually doing anything. Just hitting n turn
1639.52,1644.48, much. That's a bit of an exaggeration but not that much. Yeah. It was bad. It was like the
1644.48,1649.28, whole wrong way to go. You guys recommend this crazy daunting game that has a search bar.
1649.52,1655.28, Yes. I love it. I do. I do. I do are just getting into this genre. I don't necessarily recommend
1655.28,1662.08, it for some people getting just into it. Maybe Jeff does. I think it is shockingly friendly for
1662.08,1668.08, how much is going on here. That is absolutely I totally agree with that assessment. It is shockingly
1668.08,1675.44, accessible for such a hardcore game. But if you are a PC gamer and a strategy fan and you are
1675.52,1679.92, looking to take it up a notch. Maybe you got into company heroes because there's a genre
1679.92,1685.3600000000001," something. This. In fact, I would like I would wonder if Sean would be into this kind of thing."
1685.3600000000001,1689.28, There might be two. I'm impressed interest. Did he? Yeah. Yeah. I would have to get his take up.
1689.28,1696.56," I mean, it is like halfway. It's not as complicated and only it is. I don't like a tactical"
1696.56,1701.1200000000001, one-to-one basis for each for the battles specifically as it is like a company of heroes. But
1701.9199999999998,1708.32," you are also getting the wider perspective. Well, the economic game. Which is just a really rich and cool."
1708.9599999999998,1714.6399999999999," Well, if we get him to stop walking around naked in a second life. I do have to make a confession"
1714.6399999999999,1718.32, of certain absolute hypocrite. Yeah. It is life we are talking about achievements.
1719.52,1725.84, Yeah. So this game has got achievements. That game is from Windows Live achievements. But it has
1725.84,1728.9599999999998, got a little tag like a game of achievements. And that's the counts of money and stuff.
1731.04,1740.24," So one of them in the achievements is to research all of the hostility tree, which is because"
1740.24,1747.12," each civilization has two trees. One is for war, one is for economy and civilized, you know,"
1747.12,1752.9599999999998," civics, government and next sort of thing. One of the achievements is to research all of one tree"
1752.96,1758.16, without touching anything in the other tree. Okay. So it's kind of doing an experimental game.
1758.16,1764.64, Just to try to build up just hostility for the advent I think I can't remember what was for it.
1764.64,1768.4," Yeah, because it was called hostility. We need to do an experiment specifically for the..."
1768.4,1771.6000000000001," No, I started just kidding it because I was just like, okay, I'm just going to try this battle"
1771.6000000000001,1776.72, just being like a warmonger without getting. So I realized a little bit into it that I hadn't
1776.72,1781.28," touched the harm industry nor had I built temples of harmony, which are the things that allow you"
1781.28,1787.36, to research that tree. So I was about to win. There's like one planet left for the other
1788.0,1795.6," for the AI I was playing against and I still had maybe 20 things to research. So I'm just like,"
1797.44,1800.8799999999999, I could probably get that achievement. This is the pilot last time of every even
1800.8799999999999,1807.52, consider like just doing going down the hostility tree. So you did it for me. I clicked all of the...
1807.52,1810.96," You can cue... You can cue out. You can... As long as you have the resources, you can bring up the order"
1810.96,1815.28, of research and just let it go. Right. So I did that. I could only get maybe half of them.
1815.28,1819.92, Could have been none of money. So then I just kind of let it sit there and watch TV while I was
1819.92,1824.8, researching. Wow. Then I went back and then clicked on some more and then we're back and watch some
1824.8,1828.24, television. Wow. And then eventually. And then I just typically for the chief. And like literally
1829.12,1835.44," two hours later. Wow. At the bottom of the screen and like two point time. That said, achievement"
1835.44,1841.52, unlocked. Advent has to let him onger or whatever it was. And then what did you get for that
1841.52,1848.24," challenge? I got to turn off my game. You got it didn't unlock some like cool union. No,"
1848.24,1853.2," it was unlocked in achievement, which is right. I don't know what it was for had. I mean, I'm very"
1853.2,1861.1200000000001," feel now ashamed. Very, very ashamed. Hey, speaking of achievements as I predicted in our last podcast."
1861.12,1864.9599999999998," Yeah. Multiple people on steam have. And then on one out of sent me like,"
1864.9599999999998,1868.4799999999998," I've probably just feel like, hey, I'll be your, I'll be your headshot dummy."
1868.4799999999998,1872.1599999999999," So I'll tell the stand there and take the shots so you can get that achievement. I mean, I haven't"
1872.1599999999999,1880.9599999999998," done it, but I have. I have a willing servants. Yeah. I don't know what it is. I can't, I can't"
1880.9599999999998,1886.8799999999999, get over it even when I know I should. I played a lot of burnout paradise and a lot of
1886.96,1894.3200000000002," REST HD and REST is a much shorter game, but in both cases, I would, I was playing the game as"
1894.3200000000002,1899.3600000000001," the game and being in it and being into it. But part of my brain was still like, you know,"
1899.3600000000001,1904.64," but if I do this thing, then I'll get the achievement. I can't, I can't not do that. Like,"
1904.64,1909.2," I kept going back to the to the screen and the achievements page and in burnout to see,"
1910.24,1914.24," well, okay, I'm not winning races right now. I'm kind of fucking up like, what can I do to get"
1914.24,1921.28," an achievement instead? Did you, did you, had you played REST before? I never had. Neither had I."
1921.28,1926.8, So I downloaded it this weekend too. I don't know if I get it. You got to keep playing it. Really?
1926.8,1932.56," Yeah, because I love the aesthetic and I love, yeah, you know, making music with shooting is really"
1932.56,1936.56," awesome. And you know, some of the games I played recently, like every day shooter, whatever, I'm like,"
1936.56,1941.1200000000001," oh, this isn't as cool and as innovative as I thought, because this is something that did this"
1941.1999999999998,1946.56, already that I hadn't played it just because I missed it. I couldn't buy it anywhere by the time.
1946.56,1951.6," Right. By the time I had heard it, I have a huge Panzer Dragon fan. I love"
1952.6399999999999,1959.6," Orta. Uh-huh. Xbox One love Panzer Dragons. We love saga. So this to me feels like that game, but"
1959.6,1964.2399999999998," yeah, simpler. Which is like the game, in terms of the gameplay, right? In terms of the gameplay,"
1964.24,1971.52," it is. It is those things. I mean, this is a very simple rail shooter, right? But it,"
1972.48,1977.1200000000001," it's really about the aesthetic more than anything else. I mean, I think it's that. It's the whole"
1977.92,1982.88," experience of, like the gameplay is, the gameplay is not the thing that makes"
1983.76,1989.44," REST great. I don't think in my, well, I don't think anyone should that plus the music plus."
1989.44,1993.76, I think I was still expecting at least Panzer Dragon. Then no one's going to argue Panzer Dragon
1993.84,1998.8, Orta is like the pinnacle of complex gameplay. Yeah. I was expecting at least that little of it.
1998.8,2003.84," And it's just a matter of like, in that game, you could, you know, rotate the camera so you"
2003.84,2008.08," could get things on the side, the front. Uh-huh. This game, just because it's missing bad, I was"
2008.08,2013.76," suddenly like, oh, I missed that ability to like, that extra layer of strategy to know"
2013.76,2018.24," everything, like, trying to defend your mind. You need to be a little more Zen Buddhist event."
2018.24,2022.56," I think that's it. Yeah. I mean, the, the very fact that, you know, I said to so on a"
2023.04,2029.12," bit, I said that, that, I said it on one of yours, where I was on last week, so sorry, that sound a little."
2031.36,2036.96," Uh, that the very fact that there's a mode, a non-competitive mode in what you can just like,"
2036.96,2044.1599999999999," float along, you know, and shoot things to the beat with no consequences whatsoever is the telling factor"
2044.1599999999999,2048.7999999999997," of the game. Yeah, that's the game. I think I was just expecting more game out of it. Yeah."
2048.96,2054.2400000000002," Because I mean, if you want to be super reductive, all it is like hovering a cursor over things"
2054.2400000000002,2058.8," and then letting go of the button and then the way that that's all it is. But, I mean, you know,"
2058.8,2063.44," you can challenge yourself. There's things you can do to like super up your score, say."
2064.48,2068.4," Well, I know like the challenges to try to get like, you know, 100% on all the different levels,"
2068.4,2074.7200000000003," which is, which is hard. It can hard to do. Yeah. You know, when I get like 99.1 every time,"
2074.72,2079.2," like, I don't even know what those 0.9 was. Right. Actually got a red a good tip. I think I'm"
2079.2,2086.0," quarter, I think it was quarter to three, where you can go to the leaderboard and watch videos of like"
2086.0,2093.52," the top players playing this from within the game and, uh, and you get some pretty great tips on how to"
2093.52,2098.56, do these levels so you can get that high of a score. Okay. Yeah. I did that a little and immediately
2098.56,2104.48," played better. Um, but really, it's just kind of about like, you know, having the froping controller"
2104.56,2113.76," in your hand to the, to the rave music going on, you know, it's more about that. That aspect is awesome."
2113.76,2119.36," Yeah. But I think it just, maybe I was in more of a gaming mood, say it just come off us and"
2119.36,2122.96, use a full-are empire. But you think I would have wanted something that was really simple. Yeah.
2122.96,2127.2," Now, I'm finding this game to be perfect for like, you know, one in the morning. I'm done with"
2127.2,2134.2400000000002, gaming and now I'm going to have a little rave in my computer seat. I've got to say the boss battles
2134.24,2140.56," are pretty rad though. Yeah. Fuzz are cool. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, had we get on that?"
2141.2799999999997,2147.3599999999997," Uh, chief friends. Oh, achievements. Yeah. What do you have in playing Ryan? Anything?"
2148.3999999999996,2154.64," I played some while this weekend. What? Yeah. Crazy. Um, I'm suffering from a little bit of"
2154.64,2162.8799999999997, altitis. Meaning I've got a level 10 age and I got a level 10 priest and I got a level 7 rogue.
2164.3199999999997,2168.3199999999997," And you're not even getting to know 10 with them though. Yeah. I mean, that's like 20 minutes of gaming."
2168.8799999999997,2174.4799999999996," That's one of the 25. All right. An hour. But um, I just wanted to kind of try everything."
2175.2,2178.9599999999996," I figure and you just, you can't commit 10. You have one. Well, I think it's hard because like, I don't"
2178.9599999999996,2183.12," think any of the classes in a while at level 10, you have a good picture of what it really does."
2183.12,2188.4799999999996," I have another 10 of where you start to, I mean, you get a bunch of abilities at 10. Yeah."
2188.4799999999996,2194.08," And you were using none of the interesting ones though. Yeah. Like 20, you're at a pretty good place."
2194.72,2200.3999999999996, You keep going with these guys. Yeah. I think when I go back to my warlock eventually.
2201.2799999999997,2205.7599999999998, Our lock is still my favorite class. Even though I have a nine parset of warlocks. Yeah.
2205.7599999999998,2210.8799999999997," Even though I have a priest, this is like my main. We'll show you a new warlock, my main."
2212.3999999999996,2216.8799999999997," Though I did my first, I guess, wow, we're having a little mini legendary thread here."
2216.8799999999997,2220.72," Cause all three of us will be on that. I was saying that earlier. It's like, hey, this is like legendary thread."
2220.72,2224.48," My last two people. Yeah. She have to be really, I suppose we don't need to go on about"
2224.48,2229.04, while here. But I did do my first arena stuff this weekend. And I did not find
2229.8399999999997,2237.9199999999996," Warlock to be that useful. We still respect for rating. No, I had respect back to demon. But"
2239.04,2245.04," I still got my. In fact, the warrior I was with, he told me not to bring the full guard out anyway."
2245.04,2249.3599999999997," So anyway, we got killed. Arena is a totally different thing."
2250.0,2254.2400000000002," I just, you just got to know what I was doing. It's almost like an RTS and that if you're playing"
2254.2400000000002,2259.6800000000003," guess people who know what they're doing, you have to like memorize what your countering can"
2259.6800000000003,2265.6800000000003, attack the area. Every time every round I was dead within seconds. Yeah. Like less than 10.
2266.8,2270.6400000000003," Yeah, you got to know exactly what. Thank you. What to do when someone does something else and why"
2270.6400000000003,2274.6400000000003, you're doing it. There's no getting around it. Yeah. If you're doing it. What's the name of your arena team?
2275.6,2284.3199999999997, I'd remember. Yeah. Yeah. I know as I died five times in less than like 20 seconds each time.
2284.3199999999997,2288.96," And that I said, yeah, I gotta go. Yeah. I did have to go. But if you're not like,"
2288.96,2293.44," if you don't want to get in even if you're just trying it, it kind of sucks. Like if you're just"
2293.44,2300.16," dabbling in the arena, I was a dabbler. Yeah. But if you're really into it, I guess it's really fun."
2300.3999999999996,2304.16, I never could get in. Were you playing against crazy people that were decked out in all
2304.16,2312.3999999999996," purples? Was like 400. It was like insane. Yeah. Like like all epiced out. Roaks. You know,"
2312.3999999999996,2317.7599999999998," like I'd be dead before I could even see them. Yeah. You know, was that kind of thing? Like I'm"
2317.7599999999998,2322.8799999999997, just like sitting there and then I'm dead. You probably still. Wow. I didn't get the right. So that was
2322.8799999999997,2329.12, that was a barrel of last sun. Yeah. That was some good quality gaming. Yeah. queue up wait for five minutes
2329.12,2336.24, and then I'm not watching other guy. I kicked my kid out of frustration. What? Just kidding.
2337.44,2343.2, I wouldn't do. You seen it for paying attention. Yeah. But we could save that for legendary threat.
2343.2,2348.0," The end. We already talked about it. Oh, we did already. Sorry. So I was going to, uh,"
2348.0,2352.24," I was going to come in here and talk about pirates with the burning sea. Yara. Because Yara,"
2352.24,2357.44, because people have asked us to talk about that. Yeah. Other than just the new. Yeah. And I kept waiting
2357.6,2364.8," for a copy to show up. And I asked Ryan like last Friday. It's like, when are we ever getting"
2364.8,2370.8, pirates in? Do you want to win? You're the one who gave me the copies that came in the box. And
2370.8,2376.0, they sat on that table. I know because I given to you because I think like the freelancers need
2376.0,2380.2400000000002," them or something. And then you just like, oh, they're just sitting here. Yeah. We'll give it back."
2380.24,2387.12," Could it talk one? I didn't know. So there you go. Yeah. So anyway, I thought I would be able to"
2387.12,2394.3199999999997," talk about it on the podcast today. But I forgot about yield patching problem. So I mean, I installed it."
2394.3199999999997,2398.3199999999997," I'm not problem, but I installed it. Oh, the fact that you have to have that. You have to have that."
2398.3199999999997,2403.6," Yeah. So I installed it with plenty of time. I thought, but then I went through the gigantic patch"
2403.6,2409.7599999999998, updating plenty of time was what in half our pretty much. Yeah. So by the time I was finally fully
2409.76,2414.48," patched, we had like, we had like 10 minutes before we had to come down. I saw you sing one around"
2414.48,2418.8," for a second. Well, I was planning to tutorial. I did have enough time to get in the game. I created"
2418.8,2427.28," a French guy, Pepe L'Apieu, which I thought, you know, wasn't taken yet. Yeah, that's exactly what I"
2427.28,2430.8," thought. I mean, the most, you know, you're going to play a French guy. What's the first thing"
2430.8,2435.28," that comes to mind? It's something like that or you know, or Pierre L'Adumshid or something."
2435.36,2439.92, Yeah. So I just thought Pepe L'Apieu just all people think that. Yes. Pierre L'Adumshid.
2440.48,2444.2400000000002, Assuming Pepe L'Apieu would be taken. I was just waiting for this name. It was probably
2444.2400000000002,2449.84," going to take terms of surface. Yeah. Well, it got accepted right away. So I actually was, uh,"
2449.84,2456.48," I was aiming with our, with our old pal Dana jungle or it, it game tap. And I said, I just created a"
2456.48,2463.92," French guy in this game and Pepe L'Apieu not be taken. And she wrote, she wrote back."
2464.8,2468.7200000000003, So that's because you're playing a game called Pirates of the Burning Sea and everybody who's not
2468.7200000000003,2475.28," a dumbass is playing a pirate, which is, oh, that's probably right. I might be the only French guy"
2475.28,2480.4," on the entire server, which is why I got Pepe L'Apieu. So what we covered this before, what can you be?"
2480.4,2486.96," It's French French British British and, uh, pirates. Yeah. Yeah. Who's not going to be a pirate"
2486.96,2491.92, and pirates in the sense of that's what she said. Yeah. Was right. You're the guy they beat up.
2493.92,2500.4," I'm going to have the automatic, you know, recreate button. Sorry. I could, let me pick the most"
2500.4,2505.36," generative. Yeah. Go, guys. I possibly could. Wow. How's kind of a Bob Homin low? Yeah."
2507.36,2511.6," Yeah. What I shouldn't do anyway, because my wife is French. Sorry. And listen to this all the time."
2511.6,2515.2000000000003," Every week. And that's the reason you shouldn't make fun of people because you're like,"
2515.2000000000003,2520.0, I'd be that. What she thinks of your Pirates of the Burning Sea character? She won't give a fuck.
2520.64,2528.08," That's good. Look, I guess we're the other dumb on my play. Yeah. I will see about this game."
2528.08,2532.8, I don't know. You can't give us your informed opinion based on it. Yeah. Based on having created the character
2532.8,2538.4," and gone into the tutorial, I will now not pontificate for the next 15 minutes about it. I have not"
2538.4,2544.48," played very much past the tutorial, but I will say I do not like the fact that when it, it"
2544.48,2548.48," starts off with like, you know, hey, go kill these five pirates, which, you know, whatever,"
2548.96,2553.92," actually, you know what it did. It says, go kill these rats. They're they're called Bill"
2553.92,2559.2," Drats, but it's the name of the pirate crew, which I thought was perfect. That's intentional because I was like,"
2559.2,2565.52," fuck, I have to kill rats. He's killing Jeff Green, actually. No, I have pirate rats. So you"
2565.52,2571.92," got to do that part. Yeah, I got to do that. And then it's a it puts you in the sailing mode. But then"
2571.92,2577.44," all the only tutorial that gives you is like, it's like one of those quick reference cards in like"
2577.52,2582.32," splash screen format. Like how to control your ship. Like it doesn't. I know how to set it. Yeah,"
2582.32,2587.92, that's exactly what it does. So it says now we'll show you how to how to navigate your ship. And then it's
2587.92,2595.04," literally like a to a pdf. It's a jpeg of the quick card of ship combat. It's like, I think for this"
2595.04,2600.08," good, not even a voicel for anything. And in fact, it looks like a low resolution like I could even see it."
2601.04,2605.12, Thank you. Ha. You would think for this for this game is more key feature would. Right.
2605.2,2608.64, Also then when you walked in to get me for the podcast sets and fact what I was doing. I was trying
2608.64,2612.56, to figure out how to sail. And I couldn't really as it's going around in circles.
2613.7599999999998,2618.88," The seed looked like it was not burning. No, like it was very clear. Yeah, yeah,"
2618.88,2624.08, clear day. And how the water looked nice stuff. Good water. How is important to me? Good water.
2624.08,2629.44, It's very important to pirate game. It is. Yeah. So we'll see. What's the one to put into
2629.44,2633.84, the picture of could you have? I could have I could have cupped my hands into I could have reached
2633.84,2641.84," into my monitor and taken a sip of that water. It looks so good. So maybe next week. Well,"
2641.84,2646.64, maybe next week will have an in depth analysis of pirates of the burning sea. Maybe or not.
2647.2000000000003,2651.52, You should try out a that pirates at the Caribbean online. I keep seeing the commercial for
2652.2400000000002,2657.76, is that the one we keep getting all the swag and the office about. We could try to keep sending
2658.2400000000002,2663.1200000000003, stuff. There was some gigantic or box in there that big huge wooden box. Yeah. What the
2663.1200000000003,2668.6400000000003," fuck was in that thing? It was like some like a big enough like a bottle of ship. Oh, yeah, a"
2668.6400000000003,2674.5600000000004," model ship. Yeah. I don't know about that game. Can we give it a break? I think it's free, right?"
2675.6800000000003,2682.7200000000003," Free's people's bad, right? I know it's designed for like younger like teenage boys and stuff."
2682.72,2696.3199999999997, So yeah. That kind of till aren't all games. No Jeff. No. Wow. Very certain.
2696.3199999999997,2702.16," No. It's a stunned silence there. So anything else? Uh, that's probably about it."
2703.3599999999997,2710.8799999999997," Oh, hey, uh, for I forget. Yep. Puzzle Quest, which you guys all make fun of, but it is really awesome."
2711.84,2716.1600000000003, There's now on steam. Yeah. I'm probably the only one who cares.
2717.04,2722.0," Now that I've played it more, I'm gonna play it. I don't know about your 10 out of 10 in this magazine."
2722.0,2726.7200000000003, I may have to renounce that 10. What the hell? Your opinion is invalid.
2727.6,2736.0," When we said 10 out of 10, we meant five out of 10. I like it. I like it. I still think I would not play"
2736.0,2742.24," that on my PC, though. Like as I kept hearing all of this stuff, when it was, you know,"
2742.24,2747.2," out for D.S. or PSP or whatever, and I was like, oh, maybe I'll pick that up, but never did."
2747.2,2750.64," That's on PC and like, well, that's not really a PC game. Well, hey, you play like peggle and"
2750.64,2754.24, beduble and all that stuff on your PC. Right. Not as much as some other people.
2756.96,2762.32," Yeah, I'm not entirely so I think it's fun. I'm not sure about a 10. Yeah. I am."
2762.56,2769.6800000000003," Yeah. I can't hate it. I just- I mean, I can't hate it. That means it's good as Halo 3 then according to one"
2769.6800000000003,2776.0," up.com. Yeah. Game two games of the year right there. Yeah. But anyway, it's on Steam. So,"
2776.8,2784.0, nice bit of like wider recognition and I would hope that it will that will help be multiplayer
2784.0,2790.88," potential of that game. There was no matchmaking in the box copy. No, nor do I think there is any"
2791.52,2796.1600000000003," Steam enabled matchmaking on the Steam version, but at least now you'll be able to look at your"
2796.1600000000003,2800.8, friendless and see that people are playing puzzle quests and play with them. Can ask them.
2801.92,2806.32," You play puzzle quests with me. I can actually see that being fun. The multiplayer. So, how"
2806.32,2810.88," does that? Yeah, how does that could you have a persistent quote unquote character in multiplayer?"
2810.88,2814.8," You play, you pick like your character, you know, any character that you've been leveling up in"
2814.8,2821.28," single player you? So, you could have like a level 17, what would you have majors and stuff?"
2821.28,2825.52," Wizard major, Wizard major versus someone else's level five warrior? Wouldn't that be way you got"
2825.52,2832.2400000000002," a whack? I don't think that would be a very fair game. Okay, but the second. I didn't know how big"
2832.2400000000002,2837.52," a deal levels were in this game. Yeah. There are big deal. There are. Yeah, and you could probably play one"
2837.52,2843.92," just pre-made with like preset characters. Like, say hey, let's just pick this generic level 25."
2844.0,2850.88," There's not like a character editor in the game now. I mean, you have to level you have to go through"
2850.88,2856.32," the classroom level, whatever character you're interested in in playing. I'm going to buy a character"
2856.32,2862.4, in eBay. A puzzle quest character. That's what we'll said. What was that link you sent me today about
2862.4,2869.76," the Chrono Trigger auction? Oh, there was some like sealed copy of Chrono Trigger for the super Nintendo"
2870.4,2876.6400000000003, which went on eBay for over a thousand dollars. What? That's just fucking insane.
2877.36,2882.7200000000003, Someone really likes Chrono Trigger. I don't I've never understood the sealed copy thing.
2883.6800000000003,2887.92," It's a collector thing. I just don't. If you're not going to actually use it,"
2889.6000000000004,2894.48, then what is it for? It's just flat. It's just to say you have it. Like your little museum.
2895.36,2901.12," I got I find life too short for that. Well, some people don't. Some people have a lot. That's because I'm"
2901.12,2906.0," older and closer to death than them. Yeah, and I see things more clearly. People that's all they have."
2906.96,2911.68, There's like a highly sought after game. If a totally sought-offer thing you should play it. So
2912.2400000000002,2918.16," well, they probably have a copy that they do play. They're love it so much. They want a trophy copy."
2918.16,2924.08, For what? Show to who? No one's coming over because you don't have any friends.
2924.48,2928.96, Right? So who's it for you? Invest. Look there's my book there. Look.
2930.4,2938.88," Great. I got this. Yeah, it's very strange. I like that game, but you know what I'm gonna."
2938.88,2943.6, I'm sure it's probably people listening who are that type. I would really like to know.
2943.6,2948.8, Maybe you can send me an explanation. Why you would I can understand paying a little but like that
2948.8,2952.4, kind of month. That's what I understand. Why would you pay hundreds of dollars for something
2953.28,2958.8," not to play it over the comic book not to open it? You know, because I collect a comics for years. I've"
2958.8,2965.1200000000003," got the long boxes at my house to prove it, but I never in all my comics obsessiveness ever thought of"
2965.1200000000003,2973.2000000000003," buying one that I would then not open and read it. Right. You know, or or buy it happen when you"
2973.2000000000003,2977.92, try to eBay this collection though or put it on Craigslist. How much is my people want to give you
2978.4,2984.64," 30 bucks? Yeah, and I did get that been sealed. Yeah, that's true. And I did get it out that by a guy."
2984.64,2992.0," This not this time when I sold him, but the last time years ago I sold off a bunch. And I described,"
2992.0,2996.96," I don't know what I described him as good or very good or whatever, but I didn't use right, but I"
2996.96,3001.84, wasn't I didn't mean that with capital letters. Right. It wasn't like some officially judged thing.
3002.48,3008.2400000000002," And I you know, I've I don't remember what it was I sold. It was some X man comics or whatever."
3008.2400000000002,3012.1600000000003, And I sent him to the guy and the guy sent me the money and then he wrote this really nasty
3012.1600000000003,3017.84," know it about how you said they were good and and they were, you know, but in the thing itself, I had written"
3017.84,3025.44," like, you know, I'm a reader not a collector. These were all read by me, you know, I didn't, you know,"
3025.44,3030.8," whatever, because an oil detector like organizations devoted to comic grading. Yeah,"
3030.8,3037.36," getting scores and everything. Yeah. I'd like to think it's the people who do collect these things,"
3037.76,3043.2000000000003," like as a collector are doing it as like it's an investment, but it's also fun. So they don't"
3043.2000000000003,3046.96," want to play the stock market or anything, but all those people are idiots. I thought I don't think"
3046.96,3052.96, it's a smart thing. But the whole speculative comment. I think there's a large degree. I think there's a lot of
3052.96,3058.32," people doing it. That's that way. I mean, like, does that kind of dead though now? Yeah. That died in like"
3058.32,3064.56, night. Someone just made a thousand dollars on chrono trigger. Sure. That's not a comic book.
3064.56,3070.32," Flip it around. Well, you know comic books have had similar crazy sales figures. Someone has to get"
3070.32,3075.76," that money as well as give it. So yeah, we need to sell some of the shit in the CGW library. We"
3075.76,3082.4, could have be rich because of a tire. That's as if Davis property of Chris. Yeah. And if we also see
3082.48,3087.36, the real library is gone. It's long gone. You're telling me about that. I was just on the
3087.36,3094.2400000000002, way about this computer gaming world used to have the most fantastic library of games ever.
3094.2400000000002,3102.08," It was like a holy grail in a Nirvana of gaming. And it wasn't just PC. I mean, it went way"
3102.08,3110.2400000000002," back before IBM PC. You know, we had Amiga games and games in in like on cassette tape in plastic"
3110.3199999999997,3114.9599999999996, baggies. It was unbelievable. But then there was this massive purge. And we lost them all.
3115.8399999999997,3121.7599999999998, It's so sad. It makes me weep late now. I cry. This happened. We didn't ever move.
3121.7599999999998,3127.2799999999997," Yeah, we moved buildings here. Yep. We had to move buildings and downtown San Francisco. And there was"
3127.2799999999997,3133.2, no room in the other building. And we just dumped them. Is that I know? It should have done some
3133.2,3138.72," don't like someone take it. Yeah, and it makes me just weep inside. Why didn't we do that?"
3139.52,3143.04, We could totally give them away to somebody who would have actually done something with them.
3143.04,3146.48," They're probably like, they're in the museum. There and now they're in a landfill somewhere."
3146.48,3151.6," I mean, I think they was like, we were alerted that like we are on the last"
3151.6,3155.68, how many of our weeks of the old buildings rent. And this space must be cleared now.
3155.68,3160.3999999999996," Yeah, we kept getting the PC emails. You guys really need to do something about the game library."
3161.36,3166.0, I don't know how many more times they tell you that just 400 games that were there and you didn't do anything
3166.0,3169.6," yet. You didn't do anything about the game. And then we didn't do anything. Well, then it's your fault. I know."
3169.6,3177.52, We're gonna throw them out. This is another need for a time machine. I know. That's sad. Yeah.
3178.56,3183.04," I think some of them got saved. Didn't they? We didn't we weed it down the, because like every"
3183.04,3187.92," ultimate game. And that's even late. Quanna quote late. Well, I mean, we have a few, you know,"
3187.92,3194.16," I mean, if stuff in our library that dates back to before before that ever happened. I mean, I know."
3194.16,3201.12," I saved a copy of the incredible machine. Oh, God. I walked out of that building. Yeah. You did."
3202.24,3207.92," Didn't that have one of those funky like trapezoidal boxes? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like if I,"
3207.92,3211.7599999999998," if I didn't work here and that was someone asked me like, where would you think you would find the most"
3211.76,3215.84," comprehensive game library of all PC games ever made? I would probably say like, oh, you'd probably"
3215.84,3223.28," have to go to like computer gaming world. Yeah. Not anymore. In the glorious Johnny Wilson era,"
3223.28,3228.0, he was smart enough to actually preserve that damn thing. Now I feel all bad because of that library.
3228.5600000000004,3235.0400000000004," Shit. Oh, wow. His worst thing is to lose. Not really. Oh, okay. That might be it."
3235.12,3241.68," Well, they'll, they'll never be back. We'll never get another, you know, a calabeth again."
3242.88,3248.56, I don't do. Don't even don't even joke about a calabeth. I don't know if it was in there. But
3248.56,3253.12, that's a similar one. Could have been. Yeah. Ryan doesn't want to know the truth.
3253.92,3256.96, My parents is signed by Lord Brodyshamself.
3259.04,3261.44, Hand copied by Lord. Yeah.
3262.2400000000002,3266.48, Silent prayer to CGW's forgotten library.
3268.48,3272.96," No, we'll ask for that stuff. Yeah. We should take a break. All right. We'll take a break. We're"
3272.96,3280.32, going to cry into our sodas and we'll be back. You remember of a secondary 15 that is
3280.32,3285.04, brought in to find more information regarding the secret project at Armacham. Expect the
3285.04,3290.16, intensity of battle to continue and the second expansion packed to the critically-adlaimed first-person
3290.24,3298.3999999999996," shooter fair. Red, we're back. I got to stop doing that. Did it every time? Is there going to be"
3298.3999999999996,3304.0," an ad in the middle of that? Probably. Okay. Good. Whatever we were advertising for there, I"
3304.0,3311.2799999999997, recommend you go buy five of them. Are you sure you want to say that? No. No idea what it's for.
3311.2799999999997,3316.16," You might be something that totally sucks. Factors are not me. Okay, so are going to start"
3316.16,3325.7599999999998, off. The second segment here with a news article that came from Eurogamer. Is that just Eurogamer?
3325.7599999999998,3335.52, www.urogamer.net. The headline is buying MMO gold is like funding prostitution.
3337.12,3343.6," And I'll start off Runescape Content Boss. Oh boy, I'm going to get this guy's name. Actually,"
3343.6,3350.4," they're pretty done this. Emory, it sees. I am, this is like a jumble puzzle. Probably after unscramble"
3350.4,3355.7599999999998," these letters to get his real name. But according to this, it's Emory Jelly."
3357.7599999999998,3365.68," That is totally be saying that right. Emory, hey, I don't know. I am RE, J E L E. You pronounce it as"
3365.68,3372.3199999999997," you see fit. And I'm sorry, Mr. Whoever for saying your name run. Next time, try getting a more"
3372.32,3378.4," coherent and easy to pronounce name. Yeah, I blame your parents. Runescape Content Boss Emory,"
3378.4,3386.32," Helly says that those of you buying MMO currency are effectively funding digital organized crime,"
3387.36,3393.28, not to mention cheating and ruining the experience for everyone else. Speaking exclusively to Eurogamer
3393.28,3400.96," about the growing problem of illegal real world trading, Helly said or jelly said, quote,"
3401.04,3406.4," the biggest concern about illegal real world trading is sorry for this example. As I know,"
3406.4,3413.12," it's not politically correct. It's a bit like prostitution. It's not necessarily the prostitution,"
3413.12,3418.16," which is a problem. Although you might have more or problems with it, the real problem is the"
3418.16,3423.36," organized crime that's built around prostitution, the human trafficking, the drugs, etc."
3424.48,3430.0, And that's the same with illegal real world trading. The problem comes in when they start doing
3430.08,3434.88, other illegal activities. One of the biggest is the use of stolen credit cards he added.
3435.92,3444.16," So I guess this article came up because Runescape, which is an incredibly popular free MMO"
3444.16,3449.04," game that we've talked about only a little in our magazine, and should probably go into a little"
3449.04,3453.92," more. Let's see, it's both around six million active players around the world. Recently,"
3453.92,3459.76, took measures to stamp out trading real world trading by banning unbound trades where one person typically
3459.76,3465.28, gives another a pile of gold or a valuable item for nothing in return because they have paid for it
3465.28,3472.8, in real life. And he goes on to say that it's been positive and he does not understand why
3474.4,3482.2400000000002, other games are not taking similar actions to crack down on quote unquote real world trading of
3483.12,3492.3999999999996, MMO items. So what do we think? Are those people horrors? Do we care?
3493.04,3498.3999999999996, Let's clear that this point was the crime community around it is the bad thing. It's kind of
3498.3999999999996,3502.7999999999997, that it's the same argument for like some people when they don't want to bring morality in the
3502.7999999999997,3506.8799999999997, picture when they're talking about making a version illegal to say well if you make a version
3506.8799999999997,3511.3599999999997, illegal women are going to go get back galley abortions and who knows that's not regulated that's
3511.44,3515.76, going to be you know it's going to be even more hurt women. So that's like
3516.32,3520.48, to bring another politically correct assessment into it that's kind of on someone it sounds like he's
3520.48,3525.1200000000003, saying there. Right. I mean couldn't you take his thinking and then say okay well let's
3525.1200000000003,3534.32, have that be part of the actual real game and have real quote unquote real world trading be part of the
3534.32,3539.52, experience. Right and sanction it yourself. Sanctuary yourself. Right. And just say okay we're going
3539.52,3547.36, to handle these transactions so like these are the total. Yeah did they do they still do that?
3547.36,3553.04, I believe it's still I think so because that that was that it's that you can auction because
3554.08,3559.44, that was for the item's and stuff. In fact that was our way of dealing with that issue.
3559.44,3564.72, They said rather than having these third parties make money off the kind of transaction
3565.2,3571.4399999999996, let's control it ourselves. Let's just acknowledge that people are going to do this and let them do it
3571.4399999999996,3578.24, within our own you know handled through us. And of course they get a commission from every auction.
3578.24,3582.8799999999997, And well right that right I mean in their view better they get a commission than some third party.
3582.8799999999997,3588.3199999999997, Right. Right. I mean I don't know I don't I don't care what other people the only the only thing
3588.32,3595.2000000000003, that ruins it for me is if like I'm writing or something in rolled a warcraft and someone
3595.2000000000003,3598.96, joins the guild that had just bought a pallet and clearly has no clue what they're doing.
3598.96,3604.88, But I mean in your guilds. No. Okay. So I mean but if it did I can't imagine that person would
3604.88,3608.2400000000002, stick around real long and then it's just ultimately their their loss because they're going to
3608.2400000000002,3613.92, get kicked out for me in an idiot. Yeah that's sort of how I feel. I mean his ob his objection
3614.0,3621.36, strikes me as odd. I mean how much how much other I mean really are there is a credit card
3621.36,3628.48, fraud going on as a result of of people buying wow care. I don't know yeah I don't know if the
3628.48,3636.32, connection is there. I mean yeah I mean I'm okay with you objecting to just that issue itself
3636.32,3641.28, and even on moral ground. I think there's a right that's actually my problem there. Yeah.
3641.84,3646.8, But uh it's just like don't do that. I don't wish your money on that. Right. Crazy. Yeah.
3647.44,3653.36, I mean it does piss me off to when I think about it. It makes me it pisses me off but I don't
3653.36,3658.96, know if I could go as far as saying it's wrong. Right. You know I think people are wasting their
3658.96,3664.1600000000003, money when they're doing and I also think they're lazy. You know it's not like you bought the game
3664.1600000000003,3670.6400000000003, to play it right. Yeah right. Right. Right. Now to this I mean I guess if that's what you want to do
3670.72,3675.2799999999997, with your money let me guess more power to you. I guess the way. Wait.
3675.2799999999997,3682.24, Well you justify credit card fraud. This whole circle is say in order to get and maybe it's not
3682.24,3687.8399999999997, credit card fraud but account fraud in order to get the money. I mean wow is right now rampant with
3687.8399999999997,3694.16, people being hacked. Yes. You know and people will log in one day. They're password suddenly
3694.16,3697.92, doesn't work and like oh what happened? Get your password back. It's been changed. You log in
3697.92,3702.48, and you're naked and all of your shit has been sold on. Right. That's obviously to front
3703.52,3709.12, you know it's that money went into a gold selling outlet. Right. That's that okay. That's the
3709.12,3713.04, criminal on the ground I'm worried about. No. Okay. Credit card fraud gets in there. I guess
3713.84,3717.52, if you happen to make your passwords and while the same as your passwords on your banking account
3717.52,3722.7200000000003, site or whatever. Okay. Then you're by the way don't do that. Right. It's then you're stupid
3722.7200000000003,3727.44, that kind of Darwin award there. Yeah. If you're doing that. Do not have your wild password be the same
3727.6,3734.4, as anything important ever. Yeah. I mean it's really rampant too because people in my
3734.4,3739.6, gold are just like I don't do I don't download mods and I'll go to any sites and I just got hacked
3739.6,3745.28, and they're just kind of scary. Wow. So people have just come on and found their account and
3745.28,3749.76, their guys naked and I don't know how I want to believe them. Like that they don't download mods or
3749.76,3755.2000000000003, anything but that's always seems to be that it seems always happened to anyone in my gold. That
3755.2799999999997,3760.96, really sucks. It's kind of scary. I changed my password like weekly now. These are the fear
3760.96,3766.24, and I don't even do that for like my bank sites that is very sure. You mean your real world banks.
3766.24,3771.2, Yeah. My actual bank. You know. Don't change my password weekly. What is your bank password
3771.2,3777.2799999999997, John? Why it's no. What Ryan? I have a friend who's wow count got hacked like three times.
3778.48,3784.8799999999997, Like I don't understand like how that happens. See if you're a wild
3785.52,3788.7200000000003, player. Please write us. Yeah. Tell us what up. Comment tells how you do it.
3789.6800000000003,3794.4, We'd like to know your secrets. Yeah. So that I guess. Yeah. That actually make an interesting story.
3795.2000000000003,3799.84, An interview with an evil wow hacker. Sure. Write us anonymously. We want we want we'll tell you
3799.84,3807.6," tale. Right. Yes. Seriously. I am being serious. Write into us. Tell us. I mean, I guess the other"
3808.32,3812.0," you know, if you don't know if World of Warcraft would ever go this far that you could just"
3812.88,3818.0, purchase gold for cash. But I mean some other like battlefield heroes doesn't do that.
3818.0,3821.28, But we like Sean was telling us last week that one of the things that we're talking about doing is
3822.0,3826.88, you pay a little extra and your experience. Yeah. And it boosts and your experience. Yeah.
3826.88,3830.96, So you level up faster and you know experience points are a form of currency in many ways.
3832.0,3837.04, So it's not some games you need to be trying that. See how that one goes. I don't think any game
3837.92,3842.08, like wow on the scale of vows really tried that. Yeah. I mean you get your current writer
3842.08,3847.68, do whatever but those aren't. I don't really like a. Of all the things that I heard the theoretical
3847.68,3852.4, transactions you could have in battlefield heroes that wanted bothered me a little really a little bit.
3852.4,3858.96, Yeah. I mean it's the same reason to it bothers me for the same reason that someone buying a
3858.96,3864.24, pallet in without knowing what to do with it bothers me. That's about the only thing that bothers me.
3865.2,3872.16, Yeah. I just artificial means of getting XP to feel cheap to me. I'm saying this is a guy who
3872.16,3878.56," went from level 60 to 70 all with rested bonus in wow. Well, I mean aren't they aren't they paying for just"
3879.8399999999997,3885.3599999999997, an increase in the in the experience rate? It sounds like they're in constant rested state exactly.
3885.3599999999997,3889.68, Right. That's a little different than just being like here. You go here to the level so yeah it is.
3889.68,3893.9199999999996, No it is. It's still a matter of matter of major degrees there but yeah well how about buying a
3893.9199999999996,3899.7599999999998, level 50 pallet and having a level it up to 70? I think even that is that's obviously that's different
3899.7599999999998,3905.44, to do. But you don't think the buying experience curves weird. I mean you're at least getting the
3905.44,3910.8799999999997, hands-on experience with like understanding how this thing you are playing is supposed to relate to the
3910.8799999999997,3916.8799999999997, world and which you live. So and you're not I mean if you're just being handed a high level character
3917.04,3923.92, you're talking about this on legendary thread before the buying a level 50 pallet and because you
3924.48,3930.2400000000002, have a level 70 priest and right that was a different problem with that. Right that was Luke's big
3930.2400000000002,3937.84, guess that was Luke's big crusade. Right he was always lobbying for the let me buy a level 60 guy.
3938.96,3943.76," I've already played 8,000 hours of your game. Specifically for rating say like you play right"
3944.0800000000004,3949.28, a warlock and you have so many freaking warlocks on your team or whatever that you're kind of useless
3949.28,3954.96, but you don't have enough druids and you just want to like oh I see quickly be able to get a druid
3954.96,3963.36, into the hands of a competent player. So see that that makes sense to me. I'm okay with that.
3963.36,3969.44, Luke always make you know what they're kind of uh there's they're kind of testing that aren't they?
3969.52,3974.32, They're gonna have that death night is kind of sort of that sort of that idea. Yeah.
3974.32,3980.16, Perhaps if uh if that works maybe they could implement something like that I don't know.
3981.92,3985.92, I don't think they ever would but I wouldn't. I mean because they did it with Dark Age of Camelot.
3985.92,3991.6, You could start off I think at level 20 whatever that translates to if you had like a high level
3991.6,3995.68, character they added that later. I haven't heard positive things about that though. Yeah.
3996.48,4000.24, Seems like a good idea to me and I don't know. Someone out there listening who's played Dark
4000.24,4005.2, Age of Camelot and lived through the experience tell us why that didn't work or why it did work.
4006.0,4012.56, I like that game back in the day. Ryan was about five then. Okay just Camelot.
4014.16,4019.3599999999997, Ah well so we have on the agenda this week. Do we have anything else? It's kind of weird with that
4019.44,4025.44, John here. Yeah. His story. His safe way stories and his feet around that life story. Yeah.
4025.44,4030.32, Sean and the Sean Lois got his feet up on Sean Elliott's chair. You've kicked it a few times too.
4030.32,4035.92, It seems sort of weird kind of aggressive thing. Have I? As if you're kicking Sean.
4036.88,4043.2000000000003, Yeah. Take that. One at Björ's Haur. Okay so uh oh I know we were gonna talk about
4043.8399999999997,4050.0, we were gonna talk about lost. Oh yeah. We're gonna go off topic. Off topic. Sort of.
4051.2,4055.12, Yeah. Let's talk a little bit of busy gaming. This is gonna be lost spoilers everybody.
4055.12,4058.24, Last spoiler. Put on the spoiler. You've done with the PC gaming sections.
4058.24,4064.0, Boiler. If you haven't seen the end of season three of the last. Turn it off now because you don't want to know.
4064.72,4071.8399999999997, Or episode one of season four. Or yeah. Well. Did I tell you that my kid who turned 14
4072.48,4078.2400000000002, she asked if she could start watching the lost a few weeks ago online and I figured since she was
4078.2400000000002,4083.36, watching all the other kind of questionable crap on TV like desperate housewives and stuff. She
4083.36,4090.1600000000003, is now old enough to watch lost. So she watched like all three seasons online and like some
4090.1600000000003,4097.12, ungodly you know marathon. Yeah. And now she's like obsessed with the show and it's like
4097.28,4103.04, having a Ryan around my house. Like on to give her think that maybe the numbers if you
4103.04,4107.599999999999, add up the numbers and multiply by three that maybe that's gonna be Hurtley's grandfather's dad's
4107.599999999999,4112.8, eight or whatever. So bullshit. Like no Sarah I didn't whatever. No go away.
4115.44,4122.72, Nice. Yes. Has she come with any awesome theories? Not really. They're all just like
4123.04,4128.320000000001, dumb. Yeah. Yeah. She put forth any theories that like you know lied. This is all in reality
4128.320000000001,4133.2, lock is like a death row inmate and all these all these things that are happening on the island
4133.2,4139.360000000001, and all these people are just just fragment of him as he's he's put in the electric chair.
4141.360000000001,4144.400000000001, What? I'm not kidding. I saw just theory put forth on something.
4144.400000000001,4149.6, That's what it is. We based on what? I have no idea. That's all on something.
4149.6,4153.280000000001, Whenever I think whenever I think crack. If it's one of those all on somebody's head things I'm
4153.280000000001,4156.88, going to say. I thought they said a long time ago when it was not. Yeah. I think I've said
4156.88,4162.88, they're not going to do the scene elsewhere. Everything's in it. You know an autistic kid's snow globe.
4162.88,4170.08, They're not dead. It's not like a dream. I forgot about that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I would go to the
4170.08,4174.4800000000005, purgatory fears everyone goes to the I think they're all in purgatory and writing for their sins fate.
4174.4800000000005,4178.72, That's like you will you say in the first season or through 90 in purgatory. Right.
4179.92,4186.400000000001, So you guys think a season four so far? First episode. All one episode.
4186.400000000001,4191.04, Yeah. All one episode. I like it. I thought it was awesome. Yeah. I really liked it.
4191.76,4196.56, I am a man said they've that they've recovered so strong. I was ready to give up on a
4196.56,4201.4400000000005, halfway through three. Yeah. Was it the point? I think Mr. Echo died.
4202.160000000001,4205.200000000001, That was a great beginning. Was it? Was it so much five of season three?
4205.200000000001,4209.52," Oh my god. You know that? I know that. That's right. Well, okay. That sounds about right."
4209.52,4212.8, Because I like I couldn't even imagine if I wasn't even into the first six episodes where they were all
4212.8,4219.68," doing the doctor. You know, I cut his kidneys get out of here, Jack and Slyer. I mean, yeah. That didn't hook me at all."
4220.56,4225.360000000001," But it was that moment where like Echo goes away when you're you sit there and you're like,"
4226.320000000001,4234.400000000001," okay, so Annelusia and Libby and Echo are all now dead for what purpose. Yeah. That was the"
4234.4,4238.32," one. I mean, I was all in a gated all of season two. I'm just like, what was the point of any of that?"
4238.32,4242.799999999999," I mean, you know, I don't burn arts to alive. Okay. You're great. Burn arts to there. But that that's where"
4242.799999999999,4247.2, it lost me for a while. But then it took me back right. The flash forwards. They killed off all the cool people
4247.2,4252.799999999999," into and then brought on Nicky and Paolo. They did their kill off. There was yeah, later they got killed"
4252.799999999999,4258.24, off after after they realized how much they'd fucked up. That was an awesome episode when they
4258.24,4264.24," it was. But only because they could made these horrible, unlike the book characters. Right."
4264.4,4267.92, But at least they went out and style. They went off and they did that great rose and crans and
4267.92,4271.44, guilden's or anything with them. Right. Having them be kind of at the center of everything.
4271.44,4276.799999999999, That was just it was very clever the way they killed them. Still. That was where I got my first
4276.799999999999,4280.639999999999, taste that like because the whole time you're trusting that the writers just got everything
4280.639999999999,4284.879999999999, under great right. They know exactly where the saw going. And partially just the fault of
4284.879999999999,4288.08, television and how it works and how you don't know how many seasons you're going to have until
4288.08,4294.08, clocked it down. But it's just to have that much of a stretch of story just go nowhere. And who knows
4294.08,4297.36, maybe they'll reign it back in. But I just don't think they would. But I don't think they
4297.36,4303.12, will either because you know in the season four premiere last week they had that one hour recap
4303.12,4308.08, that everything you need to know to get ready. They didn't mention any of those characters and I
4308.08,4312.4, felt like okay if they really did matter and the big scheme of things they would have at least said
4313.28,4317.2, there was a sky echo and there was this guy and here's what happened. But it's like they were never
4317.2,4322.4, even on the show. So all those episodes that we devoted to learning echoes back story and all that
4323.04,4329.759999999999, is just for nothing now. I mean yeah that does make me doubt that they have a I mean yeah now it's
4329.759999999999,4334.719999999999, clear that they because they've they've announced the end date that they probably have something
4334.719999999999,4339.2, more coherent mapped out. Right. But that felt a little bit like they were making it up as they
4339.2,4343.5199999999995, went along. Yeah that's and that's where you lose trust. You're right. It's like okay you're kind of
4343.5199999999995,4349.12, losing me now. Yeah plus this is I was going to go go ahead Brian. I think well.
4349.92,4355.28, Well I think that like at least with those characters those those daily characters
4355.84,4360.88, libbies are going to be back in some capacity like in flashbacks. Okay you know they make her
4360.88,4365.84, more it's really important but then they kill her so but it's like she's got to occupy
4366.4,4372.5599999999995, yeah but in say killer because she was in a DUI just like what's her face? That was a rumor. So they say
4372.96,4379.120000000001, although I've heard stories that the Mr. Echo was killed because of
4382.0,4387.280000000001, differences with the actor that they couldn't reconcile. Is that right? He was fucking great.
4388.64,4393.52, He was great because he was a special guy because he was on Oz. No no did you guys ever watch
4393.52,4398.64, the HBO show Oz? Now here in there because he was on that and he was just an incredibly scary
4399.6,4405.6, evil bad guy on that show and it was a very different role than he was on loss so I had a lot of respect for him.
4405.6,4411.360000000001, Actually Michael also from Oz to Oz veterans. So in fact he was one of the main characters on us. Yeah.
4414.160000000001,4419.200000000001, Yeah that's awesome. So the other the other issue I have. Yeah is the
4420.160000000001,4425.6, continuation in season four and I'm assuming for the rest of the rest of the series of piling on
4425.68,4432.160000000001, mysteries without answering in the old ones. Yeah at the point and you can totally correct me if I'm
4432.160000000001,4438.320000000001, wrong here where some of these old ones I don't think they're ever going to get back to. I agree with you.
4438.320000000001,4442.08, I mean I specifically- Especially your suspicion that they will never get back to them.
4442.08,4445.84, So if it's specifically they make a huge deal about the numbers in season four I was just going to say
4446.56,4451.68, and they had that our or whatever the ultimate reality game would have with the hope that's
4452.0,4458.240000000001, worth it. We're at ends in that video and if you watch this no where they basically explain
4458.88,4464.240000000001, what the numbers are and what they mean. Really? Yes. Yeah. Well what is it? Exactly.
4464.240000000001,4470.0, No no I'm asking. Okay. Yeah tell me this thing called the valence eddy equation. Okay.
4470.0,4476.0, Which- It calculates the time until the- And the humanity. Yeah. Okay. And these numbers are all
4476.08,4482.96, factors in this equation. The point of the Dharma initiative was to- and it's- the factors represent
4483.52,4489.12, different elements of human life and the environment. The point of the Dharma initiative was to
4490.24,4494.56, manipulate the environment to figure out how to change one of the factors of the equation and prevent
4494.56,4500.0, the end of humanity. Okay. From happening in that specific day. Okay. So that's all I thought
4500.4,4505.76, after watching this video in the Zethan of the S-Arg. Pretty important information and we're actually
4505.76,4511.280000000001, kind of revealing. And they've been show Hanzo or whatever his name is. Relang this information
4511.280000000001,4519.76, in this video in this Arg. And to me to put that into this video that was online after a game
4520.320000000001,4524.88, not in the narrative of TV show itself is just which is the only thing that really matters.
4524.88,4529.92, Is obnoxious. Like it should not like if you're gonna relate key information don't- that
4529.92,4534.72, shouldn't be like that. So then maybe it wasn't key information. I think it was though. I think they're
4534.8,4541.04, done. But then that doesn't explain the significance like why Hurley had those numbers. And I really
4541.04,4546.400000000001," think explained the tie between the island and the people who got on the island. No, but I don't think they're"
4546.400000000001,4552.08, gonna do that. Right. Because they definitely made it seem at the beginning like that. I mean like
4552.08,4555.84," that those were the numbers on the hatch, right? Yep. The numbers on the hatch. When you see my free"
4555.84,4560.400000000001," tower or you see them everywhere. I think they're still inserting the numbers. You know, there's"
4560.48,4567.44, websites dedicated to when when Hurley remember he said he spotted Charlie by the
4567.44,4574.799999999999," Hoho's looking at him. Yeah. He ran out of that community store. Hoho's H is the 8th letter,"
4574.799999999999,4582.4," the alphabet and oh, is the 15th letter. Oh, that's that. I did not bother to go to do this myself."
4582.4,4586.639999999999," There's a side I always hit that has all this geeky information. Do you know,"
4586.64,4592.64," though in HL that HL is what they did in the game horse between uh oh yeah,"
4592.64,4599.84, the jack and horse and Hurley. Okay. Did you know that was in HL there too?
4599.84,4607.280000000001," Oh, there you got this is season four. They only recorded 8 episodes. They were supposed to be"
4607.84,4613.360000000001, 16. So what does that mean? Let's gonna happen in the 15th episode. Something big. Oh my god.
4614.32,4620.4," About it. So yeah, I just stuff like that bugged me. It seems like that should have been addressed"
4620.4,4624.799999999999, also in the television series and you're a main narrative. I do not. I'm not into the show enough
4624.799999999999,4630.4, to go looking for these ten gentle things that yeah. And it just struck me as a very key piece of
4630.4,4634.96," information. I'm like, yeah, that's yeah. That would have been cold and no. I'm going to tell you"
4634.96,4640.96," me this. And it's really geeky like that's more geeky than lost tends to get like you know,"
4640.96,4648.4," valence at equation and then at the universe. You know, but it's just that bugs me. Yeah,"
4649.44,4655.28," I just, you know, as long as they wrap up the big stuff at the end. I mean, there's a lot of things"
4655.28,4660.56, that I'm going to want is that if they don't ever say it mentioned them ever again by the time
4660.56,4665.6," the show's over, I will feel like they just completely host us. I think I'd explain Jacob. They got"
4665.6,4669.68, explained what this month wants to. How about photo stage before? To attach you. Right.
4670.56,4674.8, The pirate ship. And if they're going to. It's not a third. If they're seeding all of this stuff into
4674.8,4681.360000000001," this series to be like dug up in YouTube videos after people will do online crap. Yeah, fun. Like"
4681.360000000001,4686.8, fuck that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really think so. Like I really do have to credit them though for
4686.8,4693.84," being on season four and having it be this intriguing still. You know, I feel we are not even really"
4694.56,4700.08, remotely at a sharp jumping thing. I think they still totally have the momentum on their side.
4700.08,4705.12," Completely. Yeah. I mean, this is all for the like the flash forward thing was amazing last season."
4705.52,4710.96," It was awesome again in the season opener. I mean, they really are keeping us on our toes. Right."
4710.96,4714.400000000001, This is all just me speculating that they're not going to answer these. I have no idea if they are
4714.400000000001,4719.52, enough. If they do awesome. And it's fair enough from like a lifetime of stealing disappointment
4719.6,4724.240000000001," to attract the I mean, this will be another one. I correlate this directly to like the X files."
4724.240000000001,4730.400000000001," Right. The ultimate. Right. Well, that was the classic. I mean, do you like I totally remember"
4730.96,4738.56," in the heyday of X files when X files that is peak? It was I was as intrigued, you know, as a mythology"
4738.56,4744.240000000001, was first building when you realize that cigarette smoking man was actually just yet another pond
4744.240000000001,4748.160000000001," that he wasn't a big bag of like, oh my god, there's someone more evil than that guy. Yeah."
4748.24,4751.68, Like I couldn't wait for that show every week to see what was going to happen in terms of that
4751.68,4758.08," storyline. And then I literally like utterly lost interest. And at at the point where it peaked,"
4758.08,4763.44, I could not have possibly believed I would have got to a point where a mythology episode of X
4763.44,4768.88," files would be on. And I'd be like sitting in a with my wife going, yeah, fuck it. Let's just"
4768.88,4774.24," try scrabble. I wish this is, you know, like they loved monster gold. Yeah, I was looking"
4774.24,4778.24," forward more to the monster episodes because I felt like they so blew the mythology. Right, because it"
4778.24,4783.04," came apparent that they were just making it up. They had nothing. Yeah, they had nothing. And I'm still"
4783.04,4787.599999999999," not sure. I mean, they can they keep saying that they don't worry guys. We're not going to do that to you"
4787.599999999999,4792.16, if it man. Everyone's in a while. They'll do something that makes me go. Are you sure? Yeah.
4792.16,4796.4," Well, that's what I mean. I really like changing your mind. Yeah, the whole tailies season made me feel"
4796.4,4801.04," that way. Like, oh, fuck, they're kind of making it up. They go along here because now none of these"
4801.12,4804.96, people matter. They made it seem like they were important. But that's that said I really like
4804.96,4809.68, episode one of season four. I thought it was really good. Who do you guys see OCNX six are?
4810.48,4817.12," Okay, well, we know three of them. So the other three. Thar. So I heard and then it's one of them"
4817.12,4825.68," Ben, person who died. Oh, no. Probably. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Really Ben, you think it's one of the OCNX"
4825.68,4830.72," six. Sure. Why not? He wasn't on OCNX. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He's not in the right because he wasn't."
4830.72,4837.92," He wouldn't have been found again. Okay, so scrub that. I don't know. I just make and stuff up the dog."
4840.72,4844.64, They totally didn't. They totally didn't. The Michael count. They can have a dog flashback.
4845.52,4850.56," A whole episode that's a flashback from the dog. The dog's a pretty awesome. I mean, the dog looks like"
4850.56,4855.04," horn around and see like random. Oh, a hungry again. There's another one. Okay. What?"
4855.04,4859.68," That web was so would you show it, but you're right before? Oh, I know. So I don't know if you saw this one."
4859.68,4864.080000000001, So spoiler alert for the web was so where they show Vincent running around from Vincent's
4864.080000000001,4868.240000000001," perspective, you don't run into the grass. And it comes upon Jack's father in the forest."
4869.280000000001,4873.92," And you're like, oh, what was what's he doing? And then he's like, what does he say? He's like,"
4873.92,4878.080000000001," you have to go find my son. He's over there unconscious. You know, and he's got work to do."
4878.4,4883.92, And then it goes to like the opening moment of the very first episode. So he's what's it take away from this that
4883.92,4890.5599999999995, before you've even watched last Jack's father quote unquote has been here. Maybe manipulating
4890.5599999999995,4895.2, things or in a month. We've seen dead people alive and speaking to other characters before.
4895.2,4900.96, It's talking to a dog. He can. Why would he tell us to Vincent? I don't know. I didn't care.
4900.96,4907.76," I don't know. But for him, and I said that video around with like, oh my god, you got to watch this."
4907.76,4912.96," And I just like so. And yeah, again, so if the supposed to be key information,"
4912.96,4919.04," why is it in a web as so? And if it's not, then like who cares? Like it's to read here. And if it is,"
4919.04,4924.08," then why is it in a web as so? Exactly. So I don't know what to make of that. I mean, we've seen his"
4924.08,4930.24, his ghost or whatever it is on the island before. So he just dead. Yeah. So I get it's not new in
4930.24,4933.679999999999, for me. Okay. So what was your deal that your tannis or some spoiler about?
4934.4,4941.04," Oh, well, about Jacob's cabin. So that was him sitting in the chair. That was Jack's dad sitting in."
4941.04,4946.08," I mean, you can tell from the white shoes. Yeah. And I mean, there. I remember that. I did not pick"
4946.08,4950.48," up on that at all. I didn't either. Yeah. I had to hear you tell me that. There were trailers,"
4950.48,4954.719999999999, previous to the episode where you could see him clearly freeze framed. Okay.
4954.719999999999,4959.28, I'm a little more clear. It couldn't get pasted. But apparently I read an interview today with
4959.36,4965.679999999999," George Garcia who plays Harley. And he said that when they filmed it, they shot it with him in the chair."
4965.679999999999,4973.36, Harley in the chair. Yes. Ha. So I guess they changed it later. I wonder if that's them. So what
4973.36,4978.96, is a messing with their own actors? Maybe they've heard of that before. Like people sure or even
4978.96,4983.12," not necessarily messing with their actors, but like just messing with anyone who's like, you know,"
4983.12,4986.5599999999995, filling three different versions of an ending of a movie just to make sure the real one doesn't
4986.64,4991.76, get leaked. Right. Right. Right. That could be that. Or they changed their mind and screw them.
4991.76,4996.72," Right. They don't know who Jacob is. Every interview I've seen with Cass, you know, people"
4996.72,5000.56," ask, what's going on? What do you think? And they're like, we don't know anymore. Right. Right. Right."
5000.56,5006.64, Right. So. Yeah. What was a TV show that ended with that? You're totally making me think of
5006.64,5011.92, something where they had to pass out multiple versions of the script so that people wouldn't know
5012.0,5015.28," what the real one was. God damn. Oh, I don't know. It's driving me crazy now."
5016.64,5023.28," Dallas. Let's say Dallas. One of those kind of shows I guess. Yeah. Well, he's secret. Yeah."
5023.28,5033.2, Alph. So he does go back to Mel Mac. Get to take it away. I'll get taken away by the government.
5033.2,5037.28, That's how it ends. Was that what happened? It was supposed to be a cliffhanger and another season
5037.36,5042.48," would have come on, but that didn't happen. Are you serious? I'm not making this up. I know how"
5042.48,5051.759999999999, Alphan's. Wow. Anyway. Is that a whole writer's dragon? Who knows when that's going to be over?
5052.5599999999995,5056.719999999999, Yeah. Yeah. That kind of fucked this all season up. And her day we're having informal talks to
5056.719999999999,5061.36, decide whether they were going to keep having formal talks. Wow. That sounds like a different data
5061.36,5066.24, that we're meeting. Sounds like us meeting the side. How many meetings we should have this week?
5067.92,5075.759999999999, It's progress. It's forward thinking. Yeah. Maybe we'll never see the end of last. Maybe
5075.759999999999,5080.08," the writers are like, oh, thank God. This is the perfect excuse to not finish this. Oh, God. How"
5080.08,5085.44," much with that suck? With suck. That would be so awful. They need to, yeah, they need to"
5085.44,5089.2, resolve it just so we could have the rest of that show. Yep.
5090.0,5097.44," Yeah. Well, I hope they're not done telling us like why like I don't want it all just to be"
5097.44,5102.32, now because this flash for it has me worried that now it's just going to be about who are the ones
5102.32,5109.44," who got off. What was this rift that they had between the two sides? Why do you know, why did they"
5109.44,5115.12," screw up by leaving? Like I want to, I still want to know all the like how they ended up there"
5115.2,5119.5199999999995, and why they ended up there because there's been so many things that have intimated in the first
5119.5199999999995,5124.24, couple seasons like they're there for a reason. Right. The island brought them there. Like I still
5124.24,5128.64," want to know all that part of it. Well, I mean, you still get to that till the like I mean, very end."
5128.64,5132.48," I mean, you've seen Jack and Hurley both raving about how they need to go back. So I'm sure they're"
5132.48,5137.28, going to explain that in the context of that and then returning like they had to have a reason.
5138.5599999999995,5144.72, Yeah. Like I can't still figure out if Henry's a good guy or not. You mean Ben Ben. Sorry.
5144.72,5150.72, Henry. Henry. Henry. Yeah. And we kill. I don't know if he's a Henry. He's just decent. He's out for himself.
5151.68,5158.96, Yeah. He's never can't tell with him. Credit to the writers for being really clever about making
5158.96,5165.84, you not have any clue. He is what they really. But they really mean. Yeah. He is really a great actor.
5165.84,5171.12, It's got to be hard for them if they don't really know their ultimate and goal. Right. How to play a
5171.2,5175.76," character like that. Right. Am I good? Like I got to just trust the writer to just say, okay,"
5176.72,5182.64," you've got to like just be kind of slimy. Oh, I'm like, okay. Well, I don't really know why I'm"
5182.64,5187.84," slimy, but okay. But he always delivers those lines so straight because he's always insisting."
5187.84,5192.4," No, where the good guys, you know, and he always delivers that in a way that makes you feel like he"
5192.4,5196.5599999999995," does believe it. But yeah, you don't know. I mean, we know that he doesn't know."
5197.360000000001,5202.080000000001," Not that specific fact, but you're just like the guy playing this guy. Yeah. Has no idea if he's a good guy."
5204.320000000001,5210.64, Yeah. Right. But he's convinced himself that he is his character is convinced himself that he is. Right.
5210.64,5216.080000000001, Or he's convinced or he's just like a really awesome liar and he knows he's not. Right.
5216.080000000001,5220.320000000001, Telling people these people that he is with a straight face. Do bad guys actually know their bad.
5221.120000000001,5225.84," You know, some do. Do are they like I'm the evil guy? Like does Darth Vader know he's being"
5225.84,5230.8," battered as he just like, you know, is it just his agenda? Does he know he's the bad guy in the"
5230.8,5238.88," movie? I'm pretty sure he knows really. Yeah. Soren, I guess he probably knows. Yeah. Some do it for like"
5238.88,5243.6, some greater good. Got your doctor brains for example. He doesn't really think he's the bad guy. But
5243.6,5247.92, I think there's some who really do know that the prep of the bad guy. Uh-huh. We need to have like a bad guy
5247.92,5254.72," round table. You know, get all into their psychology, Lex Luthor, Darth Vader soren. Be grudist great to"
5254.72,5258.4800000000005," have him around the table. Find out like how bad they think they are, you know."
5260.320000000001,5263.12," Hitler. No, there's waiting for a bad guy."
5264.400000000001,5271.04, Got to get a safe place. I think some bad guys know and some don't.
5271.92,5275.84," Hey, most bad guys. I don't think Ben really knows. Those bad guys do what they do."
5275.84,5279.2," You know, they think they're doing the right thing. That's what I'm asking."
5280.0,5286.24," Doc, Doc. I guess I guess if they think the right thing is to slaughter millions of people and"
5286.24,5290.4, they think this is actually the good thing to do with the new. I'm doing as far humanity. Right.
5290.4,5294.24, Magneto. Right. People deserved a good idea. Magneto was always about like the greater good.
5294.24,5298.88, He's delusional. Right. Right. Okay. So Magneto gets to be on the round table.
5299.599999999999,5305.04, But a lot of his little little little bit. We need to talk and so. And so we need to. Yeah. We got to set this up.
5306.0,5312.64, Someone work on that. We'll talk to our PR department at Zif Davis. See if we can get those guys to get them all on here.
5315.12,5317.12, You call up a Darth Forest?
5317.84,5321.12, He'll enjoy that. You know. Got an assignment for your skip.
5323.92,5325.92, What do you guys? Hi.
5326.72,5328.72," Zeta, is that how we got this week?"
5329.68,5332.56, Errr. Do we have more? What's on our little gen to sheet?
5333.360000000001,5336.88, I guess we could have segue that at any point into the last game.
5337.52,5341.92," Oh, there is a last game. Speaking of like that tangential stuff. Right."
5341.92,5347.76," Of course then that once again, if there's any actual fact that's of relevant in the last game,"
5347.76,5352.320000000001," it kind of sucks. It's in there. They've kind of, they kind of have the producers kind of said that"
5352.88,5358.240000000001, this is very much a side story because it takes place between like seasons two and three or something like that.
5358.96,5362.88, And you play a character that just made up just for this. So it seems very much to me like
5362.88,5365.68, they probably isn't a whole lot of actual substance in it.
5365.68,5370.72, We're training to the main plot line. Now we are all gamers here.
5370.72,5376.4800000000005," Yeah. I think we can presume we can, that's a safe bed. We're also all lost fans."
5377.360000000001,5381.84, Will we play the law? Does this game sound good to either you? Because it's just sounds like
5382.96,5388.240000000001, to me like it is just doomed to suck. It sounds like it's trying to play the too many people.
5388.8,5394.240000000001," Like if it was really just a straight up missed kind of game, like an adventure,"
5394.240000000001,5398.8," graphic adventure kind of game, I would probably begin to it. Like because the last is very much about"
5398.8,5401.92, solving puzzles. So why not just make a game about solving puzzles. But it sounds like
5403.360000000001,5406.72," they want to do, okay first this is a scene where you're running from stuff and you can shoot"
5406.72,5411.84, another as you're running to the next thing. Then there's a slide puzzle. And then there's you know another scene
5411.84,5417.04, where you're stealthing through the dark. It just looks like nothing but exploitation.
5417.12,5422.88, They're just yeah. They're getting waiting our interest in the franchise to make a shitty game
5422.88,5428.88, that will buy discos of the name on it. It could be it. It sounds like I mean they could be yeah.
5428.88,5433.04," I don't really don't know. No, I don't know. Being a little bit unfair, but I just don't see how."
5433.04,5436.0, It sounds like they're trying to make what they think is a good game. But I think they're
5436.0,5439.76, definition of a good game might be different than mine. That's the impression I get from that.
5439.76,5444.24, I think they're trying to play it because lost appeals to the masses. They want to make something
5444.32,5450.5599999999995, that the masses will want. What do you think Ryan? Well I mean my default assumption is like okay
5450.5599999999995,5459.12, this is a game based on a TV show. I can't get too excited for it. But it because of the nature
5459.12,5466.08, of lost to me it has it seems like it could be cooler. Just because it seems like it just lends
5466.08,5471.599999999999, itself way better than like a CSI. It leads to me because this is very much just this show is like
5472.56,5478.08," like a video game you're watching in a way. It is, but I feel like they can't really answer any of the actual"
5478.08,5483.120000000001, nothing posed by the show. So they're going to have to come up with their own. I would love to just get a copy of
5483.120000000001,5489.76, whatever whatever memo they got from the producers that's like here the thing you cannot talk about.
5489.76,5493.92, Just that. Is there going to be all the things that we want to know about? Yeah. So that's that's
5493.92,5498.64," I see. You're not going to get it through this video game. Yeah, they'll give us some answer to"
5498.64,5502.8, some question we didn't even have. Well of course they should have just made it so you play as
5502.8,5508.72, Nikki and Paolo through season one. That's what this guy basically is. His name is Elia then he's a photographer.
5508.72,5513.68, Remember Elia and was he one of the so you're playing as a background. He's a background. Yeah.
5514.56,5519.200000000001, That part still bothers me about the show. It bothers me all over again in the season opener.
5519.200000000001,5524.56, Oh whenever I stopped to think about it I just feel it's like the other sweat hogs and welcome back
5524.56,5529.76, hotter. There's had too much of an old reference for you guys. Wow dead silence. Nothing.
5529.76,5534.0, Nothing. I've watched the show before. But like I don't know. Okay.
5534.0,5537.84, Talking about it. Welcome back hotter. Do you even know what that show is? He watched it. Yeah.
5537.84,5542.0, Okay. It was on Nick and night. Oh my god. That's where I watched it as well.
5542.0,5547.120000000001, I had to be some way too old for you guys. All right. It was it was John Travolta's first show.
5547.120000000001,5552.400000000001, And he and he was Vinny Barber and you know and got why am I doing this? Why do I have to explain the show
5552.48,5555.839999999999, to you? I need to be on the old people's podcast where people know what I'm talking about.
5555.839999999999,5560.879999999999," But anyway, there was him and his and his compatrails in the in the classroom."
5561.44,5566.4, And it was as if the classroom was just those four guys because they were all the ones who they
5566.4,5570.799999999999," had all the lines and they had all the jokes that they would riff off with the teacher,"
5570.799999999999,5576.16, codder. But there were the other people in the class who they would barely show off to the side.
5576.16,5581.679999999999, But they never said anything. So and that's how these guys feel to me on loss. All the other survivors.
5582.64,5588.320000000001," You know when Jack is making a big speech, we all gotta go down to the beach. You know you're wondering like"
5589.6,5594.96, like any connection like when someone chooses sides keeps the crap where you. Yeah.
5595.84,5601.92," Oh, he picked blonde guy pick lock. Okay. Well, let's good to know. Right. And then if you start thinking"
5601.92,5606.16," about it more, then it's just starts getting way more complicated like way to minute. If they are"
5606.16,5611.280000000001," really all here for a reason, like shouldn't we know their reasons too? Like or they just random."
5611.36,5615.36, Like that's what that's the extended universe fiction is for it to tell all of their individual
5615.36,5620.0, stories and. Yeah. I think that form and a novel form and an alternate reality game form.
5620.0,5624.88, I just I just wonder why they're even there. Then though like why can't they just have had 10 survivors?
5624.88,5629.28, And it's just like these 10 people we know. The fact that there's other people that we don't know
5629.28,5634.4, makes me keep feeling like I just feel uncomfortable. I guess most say I feel bad for them.
5634.719999999999,5638.639999999999, That doesn't bother me. I want to know. I'm not knowing about those other guys just to never
5638.8,5645.4400000000005, has bothered me. You don't want to know about Steve and Scott. Don't you feel bad when you
5645.4400000000005,5649.68," see them walk and bye? I just want to go, hey, hi. Hey, this is hanging up through a long"
5649.68,5654.240000000001," video, yeah, right. Open an account book. I'm sorry that came my never shows you."
5654.240000000001,5659.92," I'm sure you're important in your own world. Hey, hey. I think that pass up granola bars today"
5659.92,5664.72," and then I've started about nikiem, hala when niki dies. Or well when she's, you know,"
5664.72,5667.92, paralyzed whatever somebody's like Nikki Nikki's dead.
5667.92,5669.72," Sorry, it's just like who the hell's Nikki?"
5669.72,5670.72, Yeah.
5670.72,5671.72," Yeah, that was funny."
5671.72,5672.72, That's kind of.
5672.72,5674.72, And then it was also the episode with the teacher guy.
5674.72,5676.72, Remember the blow who gets blown up.
5676.72,5677.72, Right.
5677.72,5678.72, Doc Arst.
5678.72,5679.72, Right.
5679.72,5680.72, That's funny.
5680.72,5681.72, It's unbelievable.
5681.72,5682.72," I mean, another red shirt."
5682.72,5683.72, So the show.
5683.72,5684.72, The red shirts.
5684.72,5685.72, Yeah.
5685.72,5686.72, But then he had some like angry rant about.
5686.72,5687.72," Oh, you people think it's about you."
5687.72,5688.72, And then he explodes.
5688.72,5689.72, Right.
5689.72,5691.72, So that was great.
5691.72,5692.72, That's funny.
5692.72,5697.72," You know, self-aware, fourth wall breaking is not necessarily awesome narrative in the sense, but"
5697.72,5698.72, at least they're aware of it.
5698.72,5699.72, Yeah.
5699.72,5705.72, It's nice to have an infinite pool of people to draw upon to blow up when they need it.
5705.72,5708.72," I think that's the one where I'm in the 40, whatever."
5708.72,5709.72, That's kind of true.
5709.72,5713.72, I guess that's why they're there in case they ever need to kill somebody.
5713.72,5714.72, Yeah.
5714.72,5715.72, Okay.
5715.72,5716.72, You're up.
5716.72,5717.72, No.
5717.72,5718.72, Come on.
5718.72,5721.72, I've just been drinking out of coconut and living in Hawaii.
5721.72,5722.72, Come on.
5722.72,5723.72, Don't kill me.
5723.72,5727.72," They didn't need that in Gilligan, Silent."
5727.72,5728.72, You're right.
5728.72,5730.72," See, Gilligan, Silent was some model."
5730.72,5733.72, You could get away with the same group of castaways.
5733.72,5734.72, Got them.
5734.72,5735.72, Yeah.
5735.72,5737.72, Are we done?
5737.72,5738.72, We're done.
5738.72,5739.72, Let's get out of here.
5739.72,5740.72, We're done.
5740.72,5741.72, We're leaving.

5757.72,5758.72, Yes.
5758.72,5759.72, Okay.
5759.72,5760.72, I'm not going to.
5760.72,5762.72, It's quite say yet because it's still remaining to be seen.
5762.72,5769.72, But stay tuned for GDC week here at GFW radio and one of the common general.
5769.72,5775.72," We have very, very special stuff coming up for the podcast that we think you're all going to really dig."
