0.0,8.18," Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast. This is the podcast for, I don't even know what"
8.18,15.84," data this is Wednesday. December 13th, 2006. Hi, everybody. We are here. Did I say who"
15.84,24.32, I am? This is Jeff Green. Yeah. I'm here with three of the four other editors of the magazine.
24.32,29.6, And they are. Brian Scott. Sean Elliott. Sean Maloy. And Darren Gladstone is a
29.6,36.4, way on assignment for our March cover story. He's in New York City right now. New York City.
36.4,41.56," Yeah, New York City probably drunk right now. It's 10 a.m. 11 a.m. in the morning and"
41.56,49.120000000000005," knowing Darren is drunk. So yeah, here we are. We're shipping a magazine this week today,"
49.120000000000005,55.08," which is why we're late once again. And I don't know about you guys, but is have we been"
55.08,59.92, on time with this podcast in the past month? We have we been on time. Maybe we need to
59.92,64.28," change the time we do this. But it's always after a po for PC gaming, you know, that's"
64.28,68.28," done with it's done thing. That's right. I mean, it's yeah, this is a lot of it to do."
68.28,73.75999999999999, Do not stop that mantra. Yeah. Right. We'll podcast when we post it. It's a threat on
73.75999999999999,77.75999999999999, the forum. This is where your podcast. Right. It's we came out on Monday when we're
77.75999999999999,82.4," supposed to. Then we'd have to have a patch for the podcast. The concert obviously,"
82.4,86.84, it's not there when you're told it's there. The pros are that when it does come out
86.84,90.84," and surprises you, it's like, Oh, cool. Like it. You know, right. We're out about that."
90.84,98.60000000000001," Yeah. But we are sorry. Did we even try Monday? We did, but it just wasn't the shipping"
98.60000000000001,101.48, stuff. And then yesterday had the dentist.
101.48,106.96000000000001," Selling Jeff's teeth. Yeah, blame my teeth on the lack of a podcast this week. So here"
107.03999999999999,114.36," we are anyway, Darrenless, but still ready to talk. And let's get the usual, what you're"
114.36,118.83999999999999," playing out of the way. And then we'll get to onto some more interesting and important things,"
118.83999999999999,125.03999999999999," like my teeth. Ryan, what are you playing? Are you playing? There's a couple games that I've"
125.03999999999999,131.88," been playing lately. One, I can't say too much about yet because it's not out until January,"
131.96,137.35999999999999, but it's going to start off with a tease. It's the next episode of salmon max. Oh.
137.35999999999999,145.48," It's about like the previous episode. Any, any funnier, any less funny. It's puzzles"
145.48,152.28, better worse the same. It's about it's similar in terms of humor. You see like sort of a
152.28,156.4," lot of the same locations in this game, just because you know, it's episodic. They're"
156.64000000000001,162.44," doing one in mind. So could you play like just the second one? I mean, are they stand"
162.44,168.92000000000002," alone in a way? You could. Would you want to? I mean, is there any like on last week's episode,"
168.92000000000002,173.56," kind of thing or last month's episode? You know, like I do have to buy into the whole"
173.56,177.20000000000002, thing. That's what I'm asking. Or could I just start with episode two and know what was
177.20000000000002,181.84," going on? I think you could probably just start with episode two. Yeah. Because I wonder,"
181.84,185.44," well, because you have to get it on a game tap, you don't have to like buy the previous"
185.52,189.48," one or anything. So you might as well. I can't imagine anyone like going, I'm going to skip"
189.48,193.56," episode one. I don't really care. Right. If that's the model they have, I don't like you"
193.56,197.76, have to go buy the old one. Right. I just haven't even seen physically seen the model. So
197.76,202.0," I mean, I wonder if it looks like an iTunes thing where like every episode of a TV show"
202.0,209.07999999999998," is listed. You could just get the ones you want. You know? Well, it's like as far as this"
209.07999999999998,213.44," structure of the game and getting into it, you know, it's like a standalone episode of a TV"
213.44,217.76, show. You don't have to have seen the previous episode. Okay. I wouldn't have had to solve
217.76,222.07999999999998, any particular puzzles from episode one to play episode two. Right. Stand along games in a
222.07999999999998,226.16," way. Right. So if you're still on the fan to that stand next, you can jump in with this"
226.16,230.72," one. So the one thing they should probably get props for is like, they're the one episode"
230.72,236.88, of game that's actually now had a second episode. Right. Like in a timely manner. What's
236.88,242.16, happened? I've been waiting for an episode. Yeah. When's that supposed to come out now?
242.16,251.84," Late summer of 2007 and sin episode two, right, is likely not happening now. Oh. So, you know,"
252.0,257.52," I mean, I see. Well, I mean, on on that count, it's a lot of people from the the dev team"
257.52,262.71999999999997, or I have left the ritual. Yeah. They've gone elsewhere. They've now worked for other people.
263.36,267.6," Some of the key people. Some of the lead designer. I mean, the lead programmer. That's not a good"
267.6,272.88000000000005," time. And that that, you know, that seems like a real world thing that's going to be constantly a problem"
272.88000000000005,279.44000000000005," with any episodic game. I mean, how could you possibly, you know, ensure to fans or gamers"
279.44000000000005,284.32000000000005, that there's going to be future episodes at any given point the team might dissolve. And there's
284.32000000000005,288.64000000000004," still so the jury's out on why that's happening. I mean, I've personally been trying to contact"
288.71999999999997,293.28," ahead there, uh, Thomas Stain and I haven't been able to get too much information. But, I mean,"
294.15999999999997,300.32," what it seems to imply, I mean, obviously is that sin episode one didn't do well. Yeah. And it's"
300.32,305.12," the equivalent of, you know, when you got a pilot and it comes out and people don't respond well to it."
305.76,310.15999999999997," And that's bad. I mean, I guess it works good. It means it works well and that you don't spend,"
310.88,315.28," you know, three years working on something that's not going to, you know, pay back. Right."
315.35999999999996,318.96," But at the same time, when you get those cases where they're, you know, we all know this fame is"
318.96,323.35999999999996, great pilots or the great season ones or there was whatever there's like four episodes and then not
323.35999999999996,328.96," it's fantastic, but not enough people get it. And then it's just enough to give you a taste and then it's gone"
328.96,335.52," because it's not another people got it. But I mean, yeah, so far there's no guarantees with episodic"
335.52,340.55999999999995," stuff. Yeah, the half-life episode two one, and that was is a little more. It was the guarantee"
340.64,346.0," I guess right. Let me go right back here. Garen, to use when your episodes are half-life. But that's"
346.0,351.12," what you say from the beginning. You can't really judge the strength of episodic, you know,"
351.12,357.84000000000003, content as a model based on half-life because it's right. It has a built in safety net. Right.
357.84000000000003,362.8," For kind of half-life. Right. And I mean, it valve is, it's so slow. I mean, that right, the odds are"
362.8,367.44," when episode two finally comes out, right, it's probably going to be great. Right. And in"
367.44,371.92," addition, it's coming with and it's to further complicated things. It's got team fortress two"
372.48,377.6," and portal packaged with it. Yeah. So I mean, who's to say? Because I mean, shit, I would buy if"
377.6,381.68," it, it doesn't even matter what it came with. That has to be fortress two. I'll pay whatever. It's just"
381.68,386.0," like 59 bucks. I'll pay that for team fortress two and whatever else comes with it. Right. So I mean,"
386.0,390.8, there's so many ways is that you just can't look at that at how I see. But remember our cover line
390.8,396.8," for when we did the half-life episode one article, it was like a new half-life every three months. Right."
396.8,406.56," Yes. No. So I mean, and so that, you know, I mean, maybe we got to call something different"
406.56,411.04, than episodic content or something really there like expansions at this point or something.
411.04,416.56," Yeah. I mean, yeah, they really are, you know. And then that rate they're expansion. Yeah. And then"
416.56,420.40000000000003," our expectations are different, you know. But if you're going to tell us that we're going to get"
420.40000000000003,424.8," episodes, right, then I would expect something more like what we actually are seeing with salmon"
424.8,430.16," max, right? Because it did that what was the time span between one and two. Um, one and two."
430.16,435.28000000000003," Episode one came out in November. And now episode two is coming out in early January. See,"
435.28000000000003,439.44, that's cool. That's really a lot. Yeah. That's like as often as we get lost episodes.
439.44,445.28000000000003," These news. Not that I like. And so far, according to the schedule that's on their website, I mean,"
445.28000000000003,451.92, they're firing on hitting a monthly release. Did we ever hear back from them about our review of
451.92,459.28000000000003," that game? Hmm. You know, we didn't follow. I don't think they had anything to say."
460.48,463.28000000000003, I'm obsessed. Right. I've been just what they expected. Yeah.
464.16,467.44, Haven't said anything. I'm still in play. Yeah. Me. It's stuns me that I haven't.
468.88,471.44, I'm saving them up. Good. Are you? Uh-huh.
471.44,478.08000000000004," So you're really what? No, I'm not. I should try. I mean, it's perfect. You have"
478.08,482.15999999999997, being it. It's exactly what I need to be able to hop in and hop out at least in terms of a single player
482.15999999999997,486.0, game. And it's pretty amazing. But I just really don't know. I missed the whole ventrican boat and I
486.0,491.28, see Ryan playing and they're psyching a pod to carry shop and they're different medicines on the shelf.
491.28,495.91999999999996, And all I see them is point at different ones. And I looked 20 minutes later and he's still doing
495.91999999999996,503.2," it. I'm like, at least without a obscure graphic. These were what you, they've shits are blowing up."
503.28,512.48, Making pretty colors. That used to be my favorite genre. Good adventure games can just be great.
512.48,518.88," You know, adventures in logic and you know, they're good mind. You know,"
521.84,526.56," they're clearly good. You're my entire intelligence. You obviously haven't played one of them. Yeah,"
526.56,529.28, see that's the thing. I haven't played one of so long. I'm a stupider.
529.36,536.56," But God, even the old text adventures were were awesome. Now I'm really dating myself."
536.56,542.24," But my favorites were the LucasArts ones. I think Ryan, with me on that. The Monkey Island."
544.24,548.0, I am also with you on that. Yeah. But it's been a long long time. So I haven't played
548.0,550.8, a graphic adventure. I don't even know how long. But that used to be like
552.4,558.64," the exclusive domain, my PC playing almost. Yep. Let's lament the death of the"
558.72,566.3199999999999," African-American. Yeah, it was also playing an episodic game that's not officially out as an episodic"
566.3199999999999,572.08," game. So it's been herself just in that it comes out every year, which basically means it comes out"
572.64,576.3199999999999," true. Well, it comes out more than the half life. Greater frequency than the half life episodes."
577.76,584.8," And how is it, Ryan? Well, it's feels like a freaking game that comes out every year. It's sort of,"
584.8,589.8399999999999," you know, these Tom Clancy games are sort of Ubisoft's madness. Yeah. It's kind of weird because like,"
589.8399999999999,595.4399999999999, I liked the first splinter saw. But they actually come out so often now that I'm like two behind.
595.4399999999999,600.0799999999999," Like I have them all on my shelf ready to play because I know I like the series. You don't need to be,"
600.0799999999999,604.56," you're not behind because they're not serial stories and any real sense. I mean, you're not,"
604.56,610.0," I mean, that could be an impoverished experience because you missed out on, you know, whatever the events"
610.0,614.48," in KS theory were penned over tomorrow or whatever the case may be, however you jump around."
615.52,621.04," Yeah, I can't even distinguish between the different subtitle names now. Yeah. I don't know which one is"
621.04,626.56, which. What's the latest one called? KS tomorrow. No double agents the latest. Okay. So what is this one
626.56,633.36, do that the others didn't? If anything. The big mechanic that they're trying to sell you on with this
633.44,640.08," one is this trust meter that you got because you're, you know, playing special agent Sandfisher,"
640.5600000000001,646.0," one man army type guy and you're not got the green thing on your head, the green glowy thing."
646.0,650.96," Ah, at certain points. This time you're undercover, though. You're you're infiltrating a,"
651.6800000000001,660.4," a terrorist cell. Okay. And jump around the army. John Brown's army. And at certain points in the game,"
660.64,665.52," you're, you're, you're asked to make the use these moral decisions like early on there, there's a prison."
665.52,672.64," Oh, like an adventure game. Well, there's no real consequence to them now. Well, how does it work? Like I mean,"
672.64,679.12," how does it work? Break the scribe, break it down, break it down for us. You, you have this trust meter that kind of fluctuates"
679.12,684.0799999999999, between. Like how much? Kind of like a real life. Like angels right now. I trust you very little.
684.96,689.84," I trust the story is going to be worth podcasting about. It's, it's a way."
690.9599999999999,692.4," This trust me, you're."
698.24,702.72," That's sorry. Go ahead. So you have this trust me, you're that fluctuates between these"
702.72,708.3199999999999, dudes back home with the NSA and this terrorist cell that you're infiltrating. And depending on
708.3199999999999,712.4," whether you, you do things that they want you to do, like, you know, do you kill the prisoner to show"
712.4,718.0799999999999, your loyalty or do you not kill the prisoner? It kind of waxes and wains between those two sides.
718.96,724.48," And basically it amounts to whether you unlock a bonus level at the end. Well, what happens if it"
724.48,731.2800000000001," ups all the way into the like untrust game of the job grounds army. Say, for example, you refuse to do"
731.2800000000001,736.64," their evil bidding to, you know, to the extent that that you're that you're allowed the choice."
736.64,739.84," They're still going to keep working with you, right? Right. I mean, they have to. You all"
739.84,743.5200000000001," sudden don't get kicked out on the street. You're like, hey, I got to go the smiths,"
743.52,748.0," compromise. Now we get to come in here with the rainbow 16 and just like straight up, you know,"
748.0,753.4399999999999," I mean, well, there's there's things that you can do to where that they'll, they'll get mad and"
753.4399999999999,758.24," start attacking you and realize like, hey, he's not one of us, but, you know, at that point, you're just"
758.24,766.48, probably going to re-loat saving. Yeah. So it's not really always big as the back of the box would
766.5600000000001,772.24," have you think? Is it fun though? That I mean, is that mechanic adding something worth?"
773.04,778.8000000000001," No, not really. They what I played it hadn't, but I mean, at the same time, the games worth"
778.8000000000001,783.28," playing to me. I think I like it more, you grind because I'm able to see even though I have played"
783.28,788.88," every single one of the series, I'm able to imagine that I hadn't. So for example, if I are"
788.88,792.8000000000001," to artificially opposed, you know, like a two-year break on myself or whatever, or if this is my"
792.9599999999999,798.88," first time of the game, it's still very well put together, you know, what's that like? That's"
798.88,802.56," what I've liked. I mean, come to a half. Yeah, compared to, you know, a lot of the other stuff out there,"
802.56,806.4799999999999," and it's just completely destroys, you know, the vast majority of other, you know, see the game."
807.04,812.4," What I remember is just like that just really, really awesome level design, you know, just the"
813.4399999999999,820.4799999999999," opportunities that gave you to try different things, the just, they were kind of like movie set pieces,"
820.5600000000001,826.64," some of them in a way, you know, like action game or action movie set pieces, you know, each new"
826.64,832.8000000000001," level gave you something, this was kind of a nice bit of candy. Right. Yeah, it's still, it's still"
832.8000000000001,837.36," delivers in that department, I think. I mean, for me, like the biggest frustration with Splinter"
837.36,841.52," cells, and it sort of comes and goes over time, and they've worked a great deal to mitigate it,"
841.52,846.8000000000001," but it's basically, it's always what they are in any detection-based game, you're going to want to"
846.88,851.3599999999999," dispute the legitimacy of whether or not you were detected. So that's always an issue, you know,"
852.0,856.24," you're trying to sneak up a set. How the hell did he? Because I mean, because it's all just based on,"
857.04,861.1999999999999," logarithms and all the other, you know, off switches and, you know, unlike, you know, perception,"
861.1999999999999,866.4," because, yeah, model it. So that just goes with the territory, but it always bothered me, but made"
866.4,870.3199999999999," me very happy that a guy could walk like one inch away for me, but couldn't see me just"
870.32,875.2," cause I happened to be in the black. Right. You know, like there's just no way. I mean, I was great"
875.2,883.2800000000001, for the gameplay. Right. And I was able to get away with it. That's just the danger of making that
883.2800000000001,889.2800000000001," kind of game. Yeah. Yeah. You know, AI does not exist to do the equivalent of what we're asking."
889.2800000000001,894.96," Yeah, to replicate human perception. Yeah, they said that's a dream-ficed that way. The one that"
894.96,899.2, really drew me crazy though was thief. Lisa first one. I heard that they fixed it a little better
899.2800000000001,903.84," after that, but in the first thief, it drove me crazy that there would be an NPC there,"
903.84,909.9200000000001," standing under the lights. And, you know, if he saw you, you'd be busted and you'd have to basically"
909.9200000000001,913.9200000000001," restrict the level. But if you took at your bow and arrow and shot the lights out,"
914.88,919.0400000000001," yeah, then you wouldn't see you. That's the lightning. But the guy's just standing there while you're"
919.0400000000001,924.8000000000001," shooting at the lights all around him. Like, boo. Yeah. Yeah. That's not necessarily realistic."
924.8,930.4," It's kind of like, you know, a game play meme they use. That was a suspension of disbelief."
930.4,935.4399999999999, Yeah. You can do it. That like wreck the game for. Yeah. Is there a co-op modem's puttersell?
937.04,939.4399999999999," Well, that's the other. That's the big thing that sucks about"
940.0799999999999,944.88, about this game is that the multiplayer is completely broken. Awesome. Right. Broken.
944.88,947.52," Go before you get to that. You're talking about compatible multiplayer, but"
947.52,953.5999999999999," online chaos theory, which did offer for cooperative maps. It has none of that at all. See,"
953.6800000000001,957.44, that was what I thought was what maps. Those were awesome. That's what I enjoyed most about chaos.
957.44,960.96, There he was. That's co-op mode. Mm-hmm. And they just didn't provide that this time.
962.4,968.32," There's there's co-op stuff. I mean, they're not like, they're not. Well, you're playing like,"
968.96,972.5600000000001," because their iterations of the competitive mode, though, where you're playing against, like,"
972.5600000000001,976.32," bots, right? Right. Yeah. I'm talking about the castors, quote, mode. They were basically"
976.32,980.72, if you took a mini narrative and you crafted in the same way you would the single player campaign.
980.8000000000001,985.84," And the two of you work together, and you go through a map that's not, you know, like one"
985.84,989.52," one area where you can go back and forth between it to do things, but where you more or less"
989.52,994.48," progress along a route. Right. And it was different from the one in the single player, because it was"
994.48,998.64," obviously, specifically crafted for two people to go through. Yeah. They incorporated a number of"
998.64,1002.5600000000001," moves that, you know, you're able to help on another. I mean, those are those are in the competitive"
1002.5600000000001,1008.1600000000001," version in this, too. The long answer there is that this is from Shanghai. The reason that"
1008.16,1011.92, Ubisoft's able to get these pointer cell games out with the speed that they do is because they have
1011.92,1016.3199999999999, two development teams that are being frogging on them. And it was another development team that did the
1017.04,1020.7199999999999," that all the co-op stuff and where it is, and that's something that's they're emphasizing again for the"
1020.7199999999999,1028.1599999999999," next one, right? Right. Where is I got a question the the the the way that they're doing that so fast."
1028.1599999999999,1032.32," I mean, it's like you said about it being like they're maddened. You know, I mean, I felt that way"
1032.32,1036.96," about Tomb Raider back in the day when Tomb Raider went from being cool to being like, uh,"
1037.04,1043.28," geez, again, like don't you think that it's a franchise like spun or so would just have more cash"
1043.28,1048.08," a if they were just a little less eager to shove them in our face all the time. I mean, that's the"
1048.08,1052.96," game would be more fun if they're paying. Right. It's paying. It has to be paying. I mean, it has to have"
1052.96,1057.1200000000001," been paying well for them. Otherwise, they wouldn't be doing it. Just in business matters. Right."
1057.1200000000001,1062.0, Then the other enough people are willing to buy or if the new people are coming on every year.
1062.0,1066.56," So it's keeping the cash flow. Right. But the other gamble is like if, you know, you got four"
1066.6399999999999,1072.1599999999999," out in four years or the other option is, you know, two out in four years. Right. And people may be"
1072.1599999999999,1076.08, still losing interest in the four year period. So you might as well get four of them crammed in there.
1076.08,1080.1599999999999, I guess it just seems like don't you think like if there's another one now where it's going to get
1080.1599999999999,1083.52," there's going to be a diminishing or two. There's no level of hype. You know, like when they"
1083.52,1087.36, out Halo three year when Halo two was announced or when Half Life Two is announced or Doom three.
1087.36,1092.32," Any of these big sequels that had, you know, four five year gaps between them, you know, three in the"
1092.3999999999999,1098.56," case of, of what was Halo two, you let people build up the anticipation excitement. You let the"
1098.56,1102.96," game become the last game to come a legend in their own minds. And then when the next ones announced,"
1102.96,1107.12," they're like, oh, God, here, here comes the second coming. Right. You know, as opposed to now,"
1107.12,1111.36, this is like the paper on your door every morning with this one. And it's cool. And you like read it.
1111.36,1116.0," You know what I mean? But an either one or sell again did. Yes, not the it's just not the big,"
1116.0,1119.6," you know, it's not the what's his name Ed McMann or whatever coming to your door. He doesn't even"
1119.6,1124.6399999999999," bring it, but one of those old ass dudes bring a check to my door for published just clearing house."
1124.6399999999999,1132.3999999999999, But did the original split or something? Some old dude brings me money. Did the original split or
1132.3999999999999,1137.36," have like that cachet to, because that like I was never really on this plunder cell. Yeah,"
1137.36,1142.8, it probably did it did the first one. Was it? I love the first. So the first splinter cell to me was the
1142.8,1147.6," first Clancy game that I was actually ever able to get behind. Like I, because I don't like the"
1147.6,1152.3999999999999, squad-based stuff. It's like too complicated for my brain like adventure games. But the
1152.3999999999999,1159.1999999999998," and everything else. But I could get behind the one man stealth thing. So, but I can't remember if"
1159.1999999999998,1164.48, the first one had that kind of hype did it. And don't remember now. It did. I think it did.
1164.48,1168.32," It does now. It was incredible. I mean, the light worked that they were doing with it. It was just"
1168.32,1174.1599999999999," incredible at the time. And as, you know, after Metal Gear Solid had basically come out and reinvented"
1174.24,1180.64," that genre, you know, excluding on the PC side, where you have thief and stuff. And sort of brought"
1180.64,1184.4, attention back to that. And then here was something in that category that was different that was
1184.4,1190.5600000000002," you know, grounded in reality and just looked remarkable. And at the time, all the things we take for"
1190.5600000000002,1196.48," granted now, night vision goggles, thermal goggles. Those were all cool. You're like, wow, look at"
1196.48,1200.4," all these ways to see it. And these are the exact same things that now, when someone tries to tell you,"
1200.48,1204.5600000000002," hey, Rainbow Six Vegas, we got thermal goggles. I mean, it's like big, whoa, but it's like saying that"
1204.5600000000002,1209.2," you've got like, you know, a trigger on your gun or something. You just, you're so used to it. Yeah."
1209.8400000000001,1215.52," While they are, I have a quick, quick aside on those things. And in some cases, they can really be great."
1215.52,1220.3200000000002," No, I'm playing some of Rainbow Six Vegas single-player now. I'm getting around of that. And there"
1220.3200000000002,1225.0400000000002, are times where definitely you create the conditions yourself in which you're going and up using those.
1225.0400000000002,1228.24, There would be the cool enough if you were the one who shot out the lights and then switched
1228.32,1232.08," to your goggles or if you threw a smoke or a tear gas grenade and switched to thermal, so you can"
1232.08,1236.96, continue to fight. But what sucks is someone he games forced you to use those modes. It's like you get
1236.96,1240.56, here and all of a sudden. So what it's expecting you to do is switch to your night vision because it's
1240.56,1246.16," dark out now. Yeah. But you just end up, it's just the same old thing except it just means compromised"
1246.16,1251.84, enemy AI. And it means looking at everything through a piece of filter for the right to the next
1251.84,1256.24," hour or something. Well, I'm straining your eyes with the kind of on your complaints of gears of"
1256.88,1260.8," like you get to the place where there's the turret and then you have to know. Yeah, I mean at that point,"
1260.8,1267.1200000000001," yeah, because it's a decision forced on you. And then, but it's got the extra like aesthetic bug and"
1267.1200000000001,1272.08, that it's just ugly. You don't want to look through those filters very long and anything. You want to
1272.08,1277.76," minimize that. I'm sure people that were in NDGs, in night missions, by the end of the night,"
1277.76,1281.6," they can't wait to take the damn things off, and like turn on a light in a room, you know. Right."
1282.32,1287.04," Yeah, that's so much Twitter. So talk. Yeah. And you know, I'm sure like the Ubisoft,"
1287.04,1291.1999999999998," if the Ubisoft people are just like, why are they begging on our games all the time?"
1291.1999999999998,1295.36, Like banging their heads against the wall. And I think this was actually a franchise really that we all
1295.36,1300.56," like, you know, I mean, I think it's pretty undeniable that this funer so games are awesome."
1300.56,1306.48," But the most part, I guess I'm just like bringing up this like should they slow it down a little."
1306.48,1310.08, Kind of. And then I don't think there's a yes or no on that. I think that's a tough question to know.
1310.08,1315.9199999999998," What is the sweet spot between, well, you know, yeah, this building up the hype,"
1317.04,1324.08," not wanting people to forget you needing to bring money into your company, which is a valid thing."
1324.08,1329.76, I don't know. Yeah. I propose to talk about left behind. I guess I just don't want to see another
1329.76,1335.4399999999998," spun or sell the force summer. Because I need to catch up on the other. In the offseason,"
1335.4399999999998,1339.84," being the year, you know, the 11 months that you don't have a spun or sell game, you get to play it."
1339.84,1344.8799999999999," On your portable and your cell phone, your DS, your PSP, you know, let me know."
1346.24,1351.1999999999998," Okay, so we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to back and talk about that left behind and firefly."
1357.4399999999998,1361.6," Oh, hello, I didn't see there. But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live,"

1415.68,1419.8400000000001," Yeah, we're a little, we're a little low down here today. Is it because of Darren not being here?"
1420.1599999999999,1423.76," No, I don't think so. I think it's because we're tired and we're tired. It's the morning."
1424.24,1428.08, Nobody has gas and we need something like left behind to get things going. All right. So we're
1428.08,1433.9199999999998, talking about left behind. So we should we remind the listening audience what left behind is before we
1433.9199999999998,1440.56," talk about it and talk about why we're talking about it. Yes, it is. Okay. Left behind is the"
1440.56,1445.6799999999998," RTS that came out fairly recently, right? I mean, we've been looking at it for a while, but"
1446.3200000000002,1455.92, I think it just hit the screen. It is an RTS that is a explicitly religious game.
1457.44,1462.96," Expositely, I don't want to say I think saying pro Christianity would probably"
1464.48,1468.88," bothers some Christians. And of course, we've had this discussion before. And we had to skip through that."
1468.88,1476.3200000000002," But basically because there's no, you know, no, there's no one single monolithic version of Christianity."
1476.3200000000002,1481.1200000000001," Or what constitutes Christianity. And once you start presenting something and saying that, you know,"
1481.1200000000001,1485.68," this represents Christianity, then you're into the trouble of the person saying, well, no, it doesn't."
1485.68,1490.0800000000002," You're right. We have talked. I mean, that's the whole thing. This is a Christian RTS. It's nothing"
1490.0800000000002,1495.44," sold. I guess it is being sold in some retail stores, which is one of the things we want to talk about."
1496.16,1502.16," But it's being sold in other ways, too. They, this company had actually contacted us to review the"
1502.16,1506.96," game, like they did all the other gaming media. And we actually chose not to review it."
1508.0800000000002,1513.28," And reviews that Orion Scott, you want to explain why the whole other discussion."
1513.28,1516.64," Am I getting to off? I don't know. Yeah. That seems like a, let's hit it."
1516.64,1519.92, That too off. Why didn't you go to the quickly? And then we'll get onto the fun stuff.
1519.92,1525.44," And then basically said, no, we don't want to review it because just the controversy that"
1525.44,1529.8400000000001," goes along with it. And no matter how we presented it, I mean, somebody was going to take a"
1529.8400000000001,1535.28," fence. I'm sure to me. It was, it's just more like a boutique game. It, you know, it's not like,"
1535.28,1539.52," our, we know our readers aren't. Was that wish? Was she though to not review it? I mean, I,"
1539.52,1543.52," this is like news to me. I wasn't, but you didn't know. No, I mean, I'm on the front of the"
1543.52,1547.44," book side. So there are views stuff. Sometimes news to me. But it just seems kind of, you know,"
1547.44,1551.92," I mean, like, clearly, you're afraid of what you're afraid of offending Christians. You're"
1551.92,1557.8400000000001, afraid of them. What arguing that your review is inaccurate because you had some kind of bias against
1557.8400000000001,1561.44," the subject matter. I mean, I mean, I'm a, I'm a, what are the, I mean, clearly are a lot of ways"
1561.44,1566.88," things to go wrong. But, but if you, if you want about it, I think the right way couldn't you"
1566.88,1571.44," do guard yourself against any of that kind of criticism? I guess he could. I guess, I, I mean,"
1571.44,1575.76, I personally just felt like our readers who's going to really want to play this game. Right.
1575.84,1579.28," You know, it's like the way we decided not to review anything. What about, what is it?"
1579.28,1583.28," Or is it? I mean, but do we know what if it is an incredible RTS? I mean, we could look at"
1583.28,1588.4," other sites and they're telling us maybe not so much. But what if it, say, for example, what if it was,"
1588.4,1593.2," what if start, you know, a starcraft when it came out had more or less these sorts of themes. So"
1593.2,1597.68, they're Hindu themes or what if the best are true since starcraft. And we just don't know.
1598.32,1603.2, We're buying a thing. I'm putting that high thing off there. It'd be right because you're afraid of being
1603.52,1609.92," in, you know, what about that Ryan Scott reviews editor? What if we're missing the boat on the best RTS of 2006?"
1609.92,1611.2, It sucks to be yes.
1614.0,1620.32," Great answer. You're fired. Well, I mean, for what you don't have to agree with whatever the,"
1621.52,1626.96," regardless of who you are. If you're an atheist, if you're a Catholic or whatever, and you just,"
1626.96,1632.32," whatever, or if your jove is witnessed and your doctrine does not conform perfectly to this,"
1632.56,1636.8799999999999," I mean, you could still just, you know, you go into it and regard it as a facial. You look at it,"
1636.8799999999999,1640.96, it's getting a facial. This is based on a series of novels. It's not based on the Bible.
1640.96,1646.8799999999999," In the same way that, yeah, you don't need to say a Muslim can read like Paradise lost or whatever."
1646.8799999999999,1650.8," And still say, hey, this is great or Blake. You know, Blake's poetry is great. I don't"
1651.2,1655.76," or what if I'm going to start a bit of this, but I appreciate it for how it's working. Okay."
1655.76,1660.24," I mean, I might have gone into Starcraft with a, you know, a really, you know, passionately"
1660.24,1664.56," pro-Zerg outlook on life. Yeah, what if it was Al-Ron Hubbard Starcraft, you know,"
1664.56,1668.0," Al-Hami. So, maybe we screwed up. Maybe we should review it."
1669.76,1674.32, That's a question. The difficult thing. I think the challenge there that we're avoiding and I suspect
1674.32,1680.72," is not being confident that we can address the intersection of content and, you know,"
1680.72,1687.28," between actual game playing the way that things are executed. And then the thematic, you know,"
1687.6,1693.6, everything else going on that makes the game what the game is right right right right right right here.
1693.6,1698.8, If the unit balance is actually awesome and that and the tactics are cool.
1699.52,1704.32, Doesn't matter that the theme of the game is that you got a killer convert on Christians.
1704.32,1708.8799999999999," And that's a big challenge because we always, I mean, and we all just speak for, you know, critics at"
1708.8799999999999,1714.48," large are very capable of going in with the consumer report angle and saying, this works or this"
1714.8,1718.8," doesn't, these, you know, these little Satanists that I'm fighting get stuck in buildings and don't"
1718.8,1724.64," come out when I fight them. But when you get to the point where we don't, what we don't do so well or very often,"
1724.64,1729.52," you know, at least at large, and just say, well, what does this all mean? How does this all come together?"
1729.52,1734.16," What is it saying? You know, how does it, what do we think about this, this thing other than just the"
1734.16,1740.0," mechanics of it was fun to shoot that or this guy, AI worked well or this environment was shady or, you know,"
1740.08,1744.56," I mean, and that's where I think the real criticism is at and this could have been a model game to like,"
1744.56,1750.64," so maybe we should try to play it and like, like, I can just pretend that like each different unit type is like something"
1750.64,1755.6," like from a fantasy or alien universe. Right. It's a like the Jews can be the way. Say,"
1756.16,1760.8," but it's there. I mean, shouldn't ignore that. I mean, if it is, if you are reacting to it that way,"
1760.8,1764.16," I mean, you shouldn't ignore that. I mean, that should be a point in the review, I think, you know,"
1764.24,1768.0," well, right. Say, for example, if you played, you know, some, I played some, you know, when the Vietnam"
1768.0,1772.24," shooter phase happened, you know, a year and a half ago, and it would like five of them at once. Uh-huh."
1772.24,1777.68," Some of them, I think, made some very poor decisions in terms of how they presented the people involved in that,"
1777.68,1783.0400000000002," in that, you know, tragedy. And, and that hasn't impact on your experience of the game. And the same way,"
1783.0400000000002,1789.2," you don't go to see a Gibson movie, a Mel Gibson movie, and say, the cinematography is so well, the acting,"
1789.2,1794.0800000000002," you know, the performances are excellent and everything. And this is a, it's a good movie because of that."
1794.3999999999999,1798.8799999999999," I mean, it's never that. It's always the sum of the parts, you know, I say, hey, this stuff actually matters."
1798.8799999999999,1804.6399999999999," And if you are taking, if you do object to these things, it's definitely your right is a critic to say so."
1804.6399999999999,1810.1599999999999," You're not just not speaking for everyone. No critic ever does. Right. And I think that's maybe why we,"
1810.1599999999999,1814.3999999999999," I mean, when it gets right down to it, we probably didn't review it because we were thinking like,"
1814.3999999999999,1817.9199999999998," well, if you're not a fundamentalist Christian or not even fundamentalists, that's not right."
1818.88,1836.48," I keep it, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're an ultra conservative believer in any number of"
1836.48,1840.16," faiths, you might take grave defense at the contents of doom or something, you know, yeah."
1840.16,1844.4," So let's not bother. I mean, you can't, I mean, you can't just run away from things because they're"
1844.48,1851.2," controversial. You know, we can't afford cowards. I mean, right. There's so many things."
1851.2,1857.52," That's okay. So it can be because we're cowards. I mean, if you're a reviewer, if we were"
1857.52,1862.3200000000002," magazine that was reviewing movies, like would we not review the passion of the Christ because,"
1862.72,1868.4," you know, because you're too, you know, I do. Yeah. Yeah. Like what if you're a Jewish critic here,"
1868.4,1872.88," I can't review this, this movie, you know, what you do is you put your, you put your perspective on the"
1873.8400000000001,1879.68," here is where my biases are because of my, you know, subject position because I'm, did you"
1879.68,1885.3600000000001," reacting to this, you know, Christian movie or whatever the case may be, you know, you don't get to play"
1885.3600000000001,1889.7600000000002," the other side, but we're not alone, who else is running away from this? This is what we're bringing"
1889.7600000000002,1894.64," to story up. I mean, who else is running away from it? Right. That's right. Actually, we brought out a"
1894.64,1901.5200000000002," printout that was in the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday. The headline was Convert or Die Game,"
1901.6,1907.76," divides Christians, some ask Walmart to drop left behind. So that's why this whole thing came"
1907.76,1914.32, up in the first place. Read the lead here. Liberal and progressive Christian groups say a new computer
1914.32,1919.76, game in which players must either convert or kill non Christians is the wrong gift to give this holiday
1919.76,1926.4," season and that Walmart and major video game retailer should yank it off its shelves. Did they hold,"
1926.48,1931.76, did they ever hold the similar protest or boycott discussion over the fact that Walmart was selling
1931.76,1936.8000000000002," the books, the novels? Yeah, I wonder. And I also, the big issue of how these book"
1936.8000000000002,1942.5600000000002," ridiculous is this. Yeah, exactly. Like I know Walmart sells those books. I mean, and it's made"
1942.5600000000002,1947.2800000000002, a great deal of money selling those books. Right. But now what is the difference now in the game?
1947.2800000000002,1952.72, And what is the assumption on the part of these concerned consumers that a video game has got some
1952.72,1959.44, kind of great persuasive power that a book doesn't? Right. That a medium that's been developed over
1959.44,1964.88," you know centuries and centuries. And all the rhetoric that's come in, you know, even prior to"
1964.88,1972.32, letting you know even a literacy that that is somehow irrelevant in light of the great persuasive
1972.32,1978.0," impact of gaming. Right. And again, too, it's like, what? Don't sell products that persuade people"
1978.0,1982.4," to think things that disagree. I mean, it doesn't even make sense on that for a game."
1982.4,1987.52," Games are easy targets. Yeah. I mean, they're this thing says here that actually the books are"
1987.52,1994.56, incredibly popular with teens. So the part of the story that I've read like three times now and I still
1994.56,1999.76," don't understand is this. It says it's describing the game and it says in left behind,"
2000.32,2005.6," set in perfectly apocalyptic New York City, the anti-Christ is personified by fictional"
2005.6,2010.7199999999998," Romanian Nikolai Carpathia, Secretary General of the United Nations and a people magazine,"
2010.7199999999998,2019.1999999999998," sexiest panel on. What the hell? Well, now I got to play this guy. How random is that? Players"
2019.1999999999998,2024.8," can choose to join the anti-Christ team. Yes. Okay. I like that. But of course, they can never win on"
2024.8,2031.04, Carpathia's side. The enemy team includes fictional rock stars and folks with Muslim sounding names
2031.12,2035.68," while the righteous includes gospel singers, missionaries, healers and medics. This is what we're"
2035.68,2039.28," getting to. We brought them in. Yeah. Yeah. We brought them in with us so we can look at some of the units,"
2039.28,2043.6, the specific breakdown in units in a bit here. I like this quote too. And then we could get to that.
2043.6,2048.96," Yeah. When asked about the Arab and Muslim sounding names, Fritschner and Fritschner is"
2048.96,2054.96," the president of left behind games. When asked about the Arab and Muslim sounding names, he said,"
2055.04,2061.68," the game does not endorse prejudice, but quote, Muslims are not believers in Jesus Christ"
2061.68,2066.64," and thus can't be on Christ's side in the game. Quote, that is so obvious. He said,"
2066.64,2072.7200000000003, but I think you have a Muslim sounding name. That guy is at least being true to his convictions.
2072.7200000000003,2076.32," He's not being wishy-washy because I think a great number of people that will say,"
2076.96,2081.92," I mean, they're not taking their faith seriously. I mean, this is it. But for a certain"
2081.92,2087.2000000000003," for his line, for people that fall that line of thinking and the way that they interpret the Bible,"
2088.0,2092.8," they get from it that it says, in order to be saved, you have to believe in Jesus Christ,"
2092.8,2096.7200000000003, this is the Savior and all those things that you're used to hearing. And then that means then
2096.7200000000003,2101.04," if you don't, then you're one of those that's going to be left behind. So I mean, he's just saying"
2101.04,2104.56," what, whether it's a whole bunch of high washer, no, I mean, he at least is being consistent with"
2104.56,2108.7200000000003, his own belief system rather than coming out and lying in order to try to sell you something.
2109.3599999999997,2114.16," Okay, so one last thing from the article at the end, it says,"
2114.16,2117.8399999999997," plugged in a publication of the conservative Christian group,"
2117.8399999999997,2123.68," focused on the family. That's a nice name. Give the game a thumbs up. The reviewer called it,"
2123.68,2126.7999999999997," quote, the kind of game that mom and dad can actually play with junior."
2128.24,2131.68," And use it to raise some interesting questions along the way. Now,"
2131.68,2135.6, wonder what some of those interesting questions are. Yeah. Why are the Jews going to hell?
2136.56,2141.92," Well, I saw that's a good idea. Good question. Fritzinger said that as precisely his"
2141.92,2146.16, company's ultimate goal in offering the game to bring parents and kids together to talk about
2146.16,2150.96," the Bible. He said, most teens are playing video games, so it was natural to turn the books into one."
2151.7599999999998,2158.64," Okay. So Sean, Elliot, you're you're studying the manual quite intently there. I just wanted"
2158.64,2163.2," to, I just think it's funny, is heck. So you look at some of the pro breakdowns in addition. It"
2163.2,2168.0," doesn't list the unit, the specific individual units name. So you can't see the Muslim"
2168.0,2174.3199999999997," sounding stuff here. But I thought this was funny. The, the basically on the Antichrist side,"
2174.3199999999997,2181.2799999999997," your units are basically trained at colleges. So like, you know, when you're building off your"
2181.2799999999997,2185.6," academic, right, when you're building, when you're building your your bases and you're, you're"
2185.6,2191.6," to deploy your units from. If you're on the on the Christian side, you train them at churches and"
2191.92,2196.64, whatnot. But everything comes from all the special units and units for the Antichrist side are trained
2196.64,2200.72," in colleges, which is kind of like, you can't trust those colleges, those college educated people,"
2200.72,2207.2," or supermarkets, supermarkets and megamarkets, wait supermarkets are forces for the Antichrist."
2207.2,2212.08," They are in this right. And then just like some of the, some of the abilities like the standard"
2212.08,2218.72," ability for all the Antichrist's swear, like so instead of like, you know, MP5 and whatever, you know,"
2218.7999999999997,2223.4399999999996," it's like they swear. So and everyone has got that ability. So it's like, and then that's posted"
2223.4399999999996,2227.9199999999996," the pre-ability. So you just go, I mean, you have a bunch of these guys put it around like,"
2227.9199999999996,2234.3999999999996," whatever, whatever, and like, yeah, that's their vein. Right. So what that's how you fight them."
2234.9599999999996,2239.8399999999997," Fuck you Christian guy. Yeah, that's your attack. That's your attack. That's your fight."
2240.56,2246.08," Then so some of let's, let's look at some of the other specifics of these are, or Fony, can you,"
2247.04,2252.56," instead of like, you know, the healers are like doctors that are trained at, you know, hospitals and clinics and stuff,"
2252.88,2258.48," as opposed to, no, the dark heroes are as opposed to faith-based centers or whatever. Okay. So again, I mean,"
2258.48,2262.4," it's like, what? I mean, go to the hospital if you want Satan to cure you. You know, I mean,"
2262.4,2268.4," it's like, so if you, if it gets even more ridiculous, I mean, you've got the equivalent of like, uh,"
2270.08,2275.2799999999997," let's see, this is read some stuff here where it was. I try to mark some pages. Okay, you got a"
2275.28,2279.6800000000003," level one Pretender. He's a classic street performer with a little global community prop,"
2279.6800000000003,2284.88," propaganda thrown in for effect. Their Pretender plays office ability to entertain, but he's really more like a"
2284.88,2289.6800000000003," behavior monitor. He's there to remind everyone that the global community has eyes and ears,"
2289.6800000000003,2295.92, absolutely everywhere. So keep this in mind. The next time you see the dude spray painted and silver paint
2295.92,2301.2000000000003, and they got a little like whistle on this mouth. He's really part of you aluminum and not he check it up.
2301.2,2309.2," I want you to do it down in the war. Wow. Yeah, like the fire juggler. That's like the devil's own third"
2309.2,2318.24," eye. Oh, he's got, uh, he makes sense. Then this, the activist, he's a level two, the activist."
2318.24,2322.48," Yeah, he's the proverbial wolf and sheaves clothing and he's certainly not all that he seems."
2322.48,2327.2799999999997, I don't like Christian activists too. His main role is definitely not peaceful. The
2327.36,2332.0800000000004, activist is capable of actually sabotaging buildings that the global community designates
2332.0800000000004,2339.84," is undesirable. So the activist is truly what they're about is getting like, whatever, like"
2339.84,2343.6800000000003," buildings can dam that the global community or aluminum, not even whatever doesn't like."
2345.28,2348.2400000000002," I mean, I mean, at least heard the terms of like getting rid of the, I mean, you know,"
2348.2400000000002,2352.0, like the art belt circles where the black helicopters know that they're basically trying to
2352.88,2357.28, depopulate the country so that they can turn large areas of rural America and the concentration
2357.28,2360.96," camps, at least they go somewhere with that. But here, they just wanted the buildings down."
2360.96,2364.56," Yeah, right. I don't like that. So is that that's a unit, the act that's a unit."
2364.56,2370.0," Other than my stealth, is that like my saboteur? Yeah, that is saboteur. Yeah, and then you"
2370.0,2377.12, got a musician. So a level one is just like basically a roadie and they can swear and sing.
2378.08,2382.4, Then you get to a band member and recording artist who can actually swear and play.
2383.2,2388.3199999999997," And then like the guru, the level three musician of the devil is the rock star or pop star."
2389.92,2393.04," So the problem with these popular rock stars, according to the manuals, that they've found"
2393.04,2396.24, their 15 minutes of fame delivered courtesy of the Antichrist himself.
2396.7999999999997,2400.88," Kable of connecting with and deceiving a huge audience, the rock star pop stars are forced to be"
2400.88,2406.0, reckoned with usually surrounded by band members. So it's like a mob like this is a mob you run into.
2407.3599999999997,2411.68, Evil rock musicians. All those nearby stop and listen to the deceitful lyrics.
2411.68,2415.68, But this is kind of too much fun to me. I can't have to play this.
2415.68,2420.7999999999997," And no, I'm thinking, I don't think I've ever played anything like this."
2420.7999999999997,2424.7999999999997," Yeah, and then you got a cult leader. That's pretty good. Oh, that's good."
2424.7999999999997,2428.0," That's pretty good. But anyway, yeah, I just had to point out, it seems funny that like we got a"
2428.0,2434.72, game that's telling us that colleges where you raise the devils. That's so we've learned from this
2434.72,2440.08, that that education is bad. Right. Music is bad that scientific medical training
2440.08,2445.4399999999996, possibly bad. It's not sure that the heo games are good. Those are good lessons to teach junior.
2447.4399999999996,2456.3999999999996," I'm not going to college. So yeah, I think that's about that on that. But like, yeah, I think we should"
2456.3999999999996,2461.3599999999997," review it. Okay. I mean, clearly, you just need the reviewers got to be confident and be"
2461.36,2466.4," able to differentiate and explain, yeah, it's a her perspective. And, you know, what's"
2466.4,2469.52, it's stake here and how much it's going to matter because it's going to matter differently
2469.52,2473.28," to everyone. To me, I think it's pretty funny that there's like that activists and college or"
2473.28,2477.76," whatever, like all the antichrist in here. But I mean, you could very well be upset about that, too."
2477.76,2482.2400000000002," You could be like, well, this is what I want to see is that I want to see the cut scene"
2482.2400000000002,2487.1200000000003, if you play as the antichrist and you win. Like what happened? There's like a big rock concert.
2487.12,2491.2," You can't win, right? Is that we can't win? Is that what that article said? Well, that sucks."
2491.2,2494.56," There's a whole other gameplay thing. I just like, why would I pick the team that can't win? Yeah,"
2494.56,2499.2799999999997, that's a bad game play mechanic. You beat the last to the last. It's because you're
2499.2799999999997,2503.2799999999997, to see you lose. They should deceive you with a piece of stuff. You're still going now. They
2503.2799999999997,2508.16, deceive you into thinking that you can win. But it's not revealed that you can't. We just
2508.16,2512.96, spoiled it. Don't play the antichrist. That's good to us. So we've got some other
2513.84,2518.08, news about controversy games. Games mean controversial or game content.
2519.68,2523.68," Cut. Oh, yeah. Are you reading them, Andy? Well, no. Oh, you should also note that a"
2524.56,2531.04," big huge games of the licensed, the makers of left behind have licensed the rise of legends people"
2531.04,2535.84," to do their next engine. Oh, my goodness. Right. They like licensed the rise of legends engine itself or"
2535.84,2542.4, something. Okay. They've licensed the people. They listen to people. I can talk. They licensed God.
2543.92,2548.88," So yeah, I wonder where the programmers went to school that made left behind. Not college."
2551.2,2554.64," Okay. So do you want to move on to some news? Some other news stories? Yeah, let's move on."
2554.64,2559.76," So we get that one thing that's pretty interesting in light of, you know, our discussions here"
2559.76,2563.76," about how we're going to crack down. And this is like a consumer-based initiative, right,"
2563.76,2567.6," to get Walmart to stop selling this. Right. You know, on the other side of the world in China,"
2567.6,2572.16," BBC reports that, you know, as we know constantly monitoring, you know, what's permissible"
2572.16,2577.3599999999997," in in game content not, but recently, I'll just read from the BBC World out report."
2577.3599999999997,2581.3599999999997, So China is enforcing more monitoring of online games after somewhere found to contain
2581.3599999999997,2583.7599999999998, banned religious or political material.
2588.08,2593.12," See, China has more than $23 million online gamers generating revenues of more than $850 million"
2593.12,2597.2799999999997, a year. Distributors must now obtain approval before releasing new games.
2598.0800000000004,2602.2400000000002, Companies must also submit monthly monitoring reports confirming developers have not added
2602.2400000000002,2606.6400000000003, for bid and content. So the latest round of enforcement was prompted by a rash of promise with
2606.6400000000003,2611.6800000000003," imported online games, some of which contain sensitive religious material or referred to territorial"
2611.6800000000003,2618.96," disputes. So this is interesting in that, I mean, I kind of wonder exactly what the deal is here."
2618.96,2624.1600000000003," I mean, are we talking about the game content itself? Is it was shipped? Contains, you know,"
2624.24,2628.08, religious references and territorial disputes territory of the speech makes me think some of these
2628.08,2633.12," games are from China. I mean, are from Japan rather than rather than than United States."
2633.12,2636.64, China is just what kind of online game talks about territorial disputes?
2636.64,2642.3999999999996, Chinese games do like they've got the big China and Chinese naval and a no one is very much about
2642.3999999999996,2647.2," territory of the speech and then also the history of, you know, Japanese invasion, the"
2647.2,2652.72," military and whatnot. So there's got to be something there, but I think this is interesting because"
2653.6,2658.3999999999996," it also applies, I mean, to stuff that's added after the fact and when you're dealing with"
2658.3999999999996,2662.72," NMOs, which is where all the gaming is really occurring there. That's where the revenues generated."
2662.72,2667.2799999999997," I mean, if you're generating revenue on software in China, it's basically because you're paying"
2667.2799999999997,2672.96, a subscription fee. Because you also get any pause for one moment to note that number 23 million people
2673.44,2679.92," put online games. Right. Holy crap. I mean, that's that's astronomical in terms of, you know,"
2679.92,2683.92, in terms of how many people are playing over here. That's a lot of people not doing anything
2683.92,2689.36, productive with their rights. Right. So how many people did it take to make the great wall?
2689.36,2694.8," I think the back of China, I think it's interesting because you're going to have to in MMOs,"
2694.8,2699.76," then, so what I'm pointing out is that so much of the content is player generated. And it's like"
2699.76,2703.6800000000003," this big, it's almost like another version of the hot coffee thing here where it's like you decide,"
2703.6800000000003,2707.36," but there are the question is, it doesn't matter who made it there. They can just say that. It's just"
2707.36,2712.2400000000002," that it exists and we're going to stop it. But so does it mean that you've got, you know, party"
2712.2400000000002,2718.88, members playing MMOs just patrolling around basically big brother inside of a game just to make sure
2718.88,2723.36," that everything that's going on is, it's weird. There's, you know, there's some of, I mean,"
2723.36,2728.0800000000004," there that exists in, in this country, but I guess it's not government monitored. No, but no,"
2728.24,2734.3199999999997, each company is doing it's own. It's all about inquiry for whatever sexual content or political
2734.3199999999997,2739.04," comment, you know, so that's happening here. So that's happening here. So that happens here."
2739.04,2745.92," I'm going to do it. It is a whole other thing. Yeah. Yeah. And the morals, thank God we live in America."
2746.72,2748.7999999999997, We have our freedom to sit.
2751.52,2755.6," Man, them Chinese are backwards. So another piece of news."
2756.4,2761.12," All right. And this is reported by the Washington Post and I'm got, I got it from"
2761.12,2767.8399999999997, my Gamma Sutra.com. Great website. And it has to do with cracking down on word of mouth and viral
2767.8399999999997,2774.0, marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's because it pertains to video games. So what's the name of that website?
2774.0,2779.36," If our listeners have not seen this one? Is it Gamma or Gamma? No, no, the, well, actually both."
2779.36,2783.52," First of all, yeah, let's give credit to Gamma Sutra. Okay, Gamma Sutra. Which is an, which is an"
2783.52,2787.6," amazingly great. Yeah. That's what site. That's how I want to give you a shout out for. I mean, just any"
2787.6,2792.16, time of browse around there constantly surprising to light up by types of stories I find. Yes. Some of the
2792.16,2798.48, most intelligent gaming conversation going on all the time as opposed to podcasts where people fart
2798.48,2807.68," on air. Right. But also, well, I did this viral ad that has caused this latest round. Okay. So yeah,"
2807.68,2811.12," we'll get to that. I mean, just a quick I'll read from the, from their new story."
2811.7599999999998,2816.0, It's basically that the Federal Trade Commissioner FTC is spoken out against word of mouth and viral
2816.0,2820.64, marketing indicating that companies must make it clear when actors are posing as consumers are
2820.64,2825.68, our customers in order to promote a product. Consumer protection agency warning includes any kind of
2825.68,2830.96," peer-to-peer communication such as posts on web logs, my space or popular video sites such as YouTube."
2830.96,2835.2," Marketing schemes are already covered under existing FTC regulation with a new warning,"
2835.2,2840.0, posts as a staff opinion pointing out that violators could receive season to sister's finds or
2840.96,2846.08," now we all know about some of the bigger ones like for Halo 2, they had the alternate reality giving"
2846.64,2852.88," promotion, which was, was called the Haunted APR by some or I love beeswilers, which was the name of the site."
2853.76,2859.44, But here what's bringing it up now is that there's this all I want for Christmas is a PSP campaign.
2861.28,2866.56," Clearly it's so many, but it's being presented as some kid, some kid's blog type entry of"
2866.56,2874.08," how he wants to get it himself, like all street right now that was a million to me that's a totally"
2874.08,2879.68," different thing than I love bees. Right. Because these doesn't feel insidious to me, this does."
2879.68,2884.32, Because I love bees it's clear that it's I mean if you really think the difference between you
2884.32,2888.64, could you could say hey there's this dude who really wants it this is Trump who really wants a PSP.
2888.64,2894.16, But or is there is there some person who's like APR he's haunted and who's like trapped up in
2894.24,2897.6," some kind of gloom, spares to you or whatever. I mean you could believe that but it's almost like"
2898.48,2904.0, if you do we know it we're not going to protect you for your own stupidity you know. But here this is the kind of thing where
2904.0,2909.3599999999997, and even on message boards we deal with this on our own forms or so we didn't. And they present themselves
2910.24,2915.44, in certain circumstances as hey I'm just another one of you guys I'm here to talk to you guys and chat and then
2915.44,2920.08, eventually they start doing certain things they start posting about Richard Favourts snack food when you game
2920.64,2924.96, what do you drink of choice right and this kind of thing or hey I know Mountain Dew there's this don't
2924.96,2930.64, you yeah there's this great offer here and there and then it turns out they're basically paid
2930.64,2936.08, promoters of a product but they're under the guise of you know lands and in the same way we kick them
2936.08,2940.16, off as soon as we find out what's up or make make a good deal for one of them yeah we say yeah
2940.16,2948.08, actually Mountain Dew tastes like urine fucker yeah you're banned so so but basically I mean I
2948.24,2953.12, definitely for that at least through the disclosure part of it you know right make if you're going to do
2953.12,2957.36, this you have to tell someone because I mean you you get you really want to world where every time someone
2957.36,2962.16, talks to you you're suspicious if they're trying to sell you something you know I mean like
2962.16,2965.92, like you already have like guys you walk out of the street and some like your cute girl comes up
2965.92,2970.08, and it's just say how you doing want to talk you know like then like just someone would elaborate
2970.08,2974.72, things but it's like do you really want to think that only time anyone wants to talk to me is
2974.72,2978.48, because they want me to go buy some piece of crap you know we're already kind of having that
2978.48,2982.72, like a endless like every homeless person in s after just be a fire marketer
2984.08,2989.7599999999998, shot at you got out of pants pain there actually is did you see an advertising so there's this
2989.7599999999998,2995.8399999999997, local guy here same Frank chew I don't know what his yeah that guy yeah his his his nickname is like
2995.8399999999997,3001.2799999999997, 12 gallons of gold and he wears his suit basically and he has the sign with just all sorts of
3001.36,3007.36, you know random nonsense like yeah not to blackout you know he's the zygotronic uh
3007.36,3012.48, black dethrone enters and that yeah and this is the kind around everywhere he's become a legend
3012.48,3016.5600000000004, in the area it's the point that like on Halloween you'll see people dressing up as him right
3016.5600000000004,3021.1200000000003, and he just appears in the most random places so like it'll be a news report on some like
3021.1200000000003,3024.7200000000003, nudist get together something you just see him walk in by the people have blurred out you know
3024.7200000000003,3029.0400000000004, their parts and then he walks by in the suit holding his sign he just ends up anywhere yeah
3029.04,3032.16, And but recently he's got advertising on the back right.
3032.16,3033.2799999999997, So I've sponsored now.
3033.2799999999997,3033.68, Yeah.
3033.68,3034.88, It's crazy man.
3034.88,3036.24, Brought to you by Adidas.
3038.64,3039.68, That's kind of genius.
3041.68,3043.2799999999997," Yeah, this PSP thing is pretty good."
3043.2799999999997,3045.36," It's actually, it's a Rasputin music."
3045.36,3045.68, Yeah.
3045.68,3048.16," So it is like fitting, you know, because they're low."
3048.16,3049.12, They're Rasputin.
3049.12,3049.68, You're right.
3049.68,3050.0, Wow.
3050.0,3051.6, By the look in that job.

3053.2,3054.32," Oh, Frank Roman round."
3054.32,3055.2799999999997, And nothing else that guy.
3055.2799999999997,3055.84, Billboard.
3056.32,3058.32, Because he's pure PC game music.
3058.32,3060.32," And he just stand on the corner like,"
3060.32,3061.04, RAAAHHHH!
3061.04,3062.6400000000003, 12 galaxies!
3062.6400000000003,3065.92, Is that going to try and make a good one forever?
3065.92,3070.48," There's something about this PSP thing that really, it's struck a nerve in the online community."
3070.48,3071.92, And I think for good reason.
3071.92,3074.48," You know, it really just feels like wrong."
3074.48,3075.1200000000003," I mean, he got her."
3075.1200000000003,3076.48, He was the version of Lonely Girl.
3076.48,3077.1200000000003, It's a person.
3077.1200000000003,3077.6800000000003, It is.
3077.6800000000003,3078.1600000000003, Right.
3078.1600000000003,3079.52, It is very much like the Lonely Girl.
3079.52,3080.48, Care about this guy.
3080.48,3082.1600000000003, There's like a comment section too.
3082.1600000000003,3083.28," And like, I don't know."
3083.28,3083.6800000000003, It's just was.
3084.7200000000003,3085.52, It's really gross.
3085.52,3088.2400000000002," I mean, like, when I first saw it was already"
3088.9599999999996,3090.64," exposed, is a fraud."
3090.64,3093.2, It's almost like I was going to this guy's blog anyway.
3093.2,3094.16, Like who was?
3094.16,3096.24," Who went to this guy's blog and was like,"

3099.2799999999997,3100.3199999999997," Well, that may be wrong."
3100.3199999999997,3105.4399999999996," It's like, while the internet, you know, does create these opportunities for this sort of thing."
3105.4399999999996,3109.04, It also was created a vast community of skeptics.
3109.04,3110.56, And the watchdog.
3110.56,3113.68," So I mean, within minutes of this, you know, some of the bigger sites,"
3113.68,3118.0," you know, some of the bigger gaming forums and blogs and stuff are immediately like calling this guy out."
3118.08,3118.24, Right.
3118.24,3119.28, So that's good too.
3119.28,3122.96," But I think it's, you know, so we shouldn't do our on for a gangster when does magazine."
3122.96,3126.8," So I'm like, so my YouTube video is some guy rapping about how cool we are."

3142.24,3142.8, That's right.
3142.8,3146.56," Of course, it was like yet another and an ongoing series of bad days for Sony."
3147.52,3148.24, Right.
3148.24,3148.7999999999997, What are you going to say?
3148.7999999999997,3149.44, It's a parade.

3184.2400000000002,3187.2000000000003," There was an announcement that there's a,"
3187.2000000000003,3188.32, what's a story behind this?
3188.32,3190.32, I could do it.
3190.32,3192.0, Because you played all this adventure games.

3271.12,3272.64, Josh Weedon's writing.
3272.64,3275.04," Like, it was his writing was so awesome."
3275.04,3276.9599999999996, And those characters were so well developed.
3276.9599999999996,3278.3999999999996, That's why I like that show so much.
3278.3999999999996,3280.48," But in an MMO, what do you do?"
3280.48,3281.3599999999997, What do you do?
3281.3599999999997,3283.04," Like, I mean, the setting is kind of interesting."
3283.04,3285.2799999999997," It's like Western sci-fi, which is okay."
3285.2799999999997,3287.9199999999996," That's not the same as, you know,"
3287.9199999999996,3289.52," I say this is a fun one, I guess."
3289.52,3291.52," But the great thing about Firefly was like,"
3291.52,3293.36, you were laughing every other line.
3293.36,3293.6, Right.
3293.6,3295.44, And then it would be some great action sequence.
3295.44,3295.92, Is there any other?
3295.92,3297.6," But in this, we're all just going to be walking around,"
3297.6,3300.48," like, in cowboy outfits in space."
3300.48,3301.68," Like, how's that going?"
3301.68,3302.96, Yeah.
3302.96,3304.16," It's like, like, uh,"
3304.16,3304.72, I think it's amazing.
3304.72,3306.32," It's everything on the, yeah,"
3306.32,3307.68," yeah, cursing and Chinese."
3307.68,3309.92," The venues making a new battle star game,"
3309.92,3311.44, based on the new series.
3311.44,3312.72," It's like the same thing, you know,"
3312.72,3314.56," first, it's some part of you, you're like,"
3314.56,3316.48," yeah, a battle star, like battle star."
3316.48,3317.92," And then you're like, wait a minute,"
3317.92,3319.6, what makes it what it is?
3319.68,3321.2," And can that be, you know,"
3321.2,3323.7599999999998," free, produced or or or spun in some, you know,"
3323.7599999999998,3325.7599999999998, the edge of way in this format.
3325.7599999999998,3326.7999999999997," That's a, yeah."
3326.7999999999997,3330.72," I mostly, the only thing that's kind of exciting about that universe is"
3330.72,3333.2799999999997," like, if you say, if you take like Star Wars,"
3333.2799999999997,3335.92, the problem with Star Wars is everyone wants to be a freaking Jedi.
3335.92,3336.72, Right.
3336.72,3339.36," And Firefly doesn't really have, okay."
3339.36,3341.92," There is no like obvious,"
3341.92,3344.48, super star class that everyone's going to want to gravitate towards.
3344.48,3345.52," Like, everyone in that show,"
3345.52,3347.2, you can kind of see them falling into a classroom.
3347.2,3348.16," Well, you do have a doctor."
3348.24,3349.6, You do have the priest right?
3349.6,3353.2," Have the, but then how is it just just some generic space"
3353.2,3354.16, MMO then?
3354.16,3356.24," Right. I mean, it's kind of what the player is going to put into it."
3356.24,3357.2799999999997," I guess, but I don't know."
3357.2799999999997,3358.72, And we know what players put into it.
3358.72,3359.2, Exactly.
3359.2,3359.68, Shit.
3359.68,3362.48, It's the same thing in every MMO.
3362.48,3362.72, Right.
3363.7599999999998,3364.3999999999996, The role player.
3364.3999999999996,3365.68, I want to level up.
3365.68,3367.52," I mean, that's what it boils down to."
3367.52,3367.92, Right.
3367.92,3370.8799999999997," Someone's going to get into the level of role playing,"
3370.8799999999997,3373.2799999999997," we'll about to like the level of role playing that was in,"
3373.2799999999997,3376.08," wow, initially, which is not completely gone, where people like who would play"
3376.16,3378.08," trolls would eventually, what everyone's supposed to say,"
3378.08,3382.7999999999997," hey, man, because they have to make an act that's, that was it."
3382.7999999999997,3384.0," Looking for group, man."
3386.24,3386.88, That's a merge.
3386.88,3387.52," Yeah, we're doing it."
3387.52,3389.7599999999998," The characters who say I, I said if yes,"
3391.04,3393.2799999999997, we're always drives me crazy to say yes.
3393.2799999999997,3394.88, You're not a freaking to fail.
3394.88,3395.68, It real life.

3403.12,3404.16," Yeah, no, maybe it's great."
3404.16,3404.7999999999997," I mean, it's still."
3404.88,3405.76, We are done on one.
3405.76,3406.32, We're always down.
3406.32,3407.04, Haters.

3418.2400000000002,3423.52," Yeah, and I liked the fact that I'd training in my forces in the college and left behind."
3423.52,3424.2400000000002, Uh-huh.
