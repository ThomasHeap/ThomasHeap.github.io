24.580000000000002,28.32, And I'm here with the staff of GFW minus steering glass stone who's on his honeymoon
28.32,31.76, Here are condolences to the poor lady
31.76,36.56," Congratulations. Yeah, congratulations to Darren and we're sorry to his wife. Leave it hot. Cheetos"

41.76,43.76, Was gave you the last were they good?
43.76,49.92," That's keep going. Let's not let the cheetos hold the show up. Okay, and Ryan you got to stop playing with your with your mic here"
50.24,55.56, mics when playing Ryan's playing with the the mic wire for 10 minutes. I'm gonna host you to you
55.64,58.24, It is kind of a CD. It's making me worry about you
58.92,61.84, When she introduced yourselves to the fine folks it listening up there
62.32,66.76, Ryan Scott this is Sean Elliott and this is Sean Maloe
67.88,73.4," Hi and yeah, we have we have the empty Darren chair. We'll see how it changes the dynamic"
74.52000000000001,76.52000000000001, That's what'll happen
76.52000000000001,80.4," It's quieter. Yeah, it's quieter. Yeah, so we got a lot to talk about today"
80.56,83.16, Let's not waste any more time. We're gonna talk about
83.72,88.11999999999999, Sean is gonna do a few dramatic readings for us over the course of the podcast will spread them out
88.84,92.0, We need a name for this too. Maybe people maybe listeners can come up with one
92.0,98.03999999999999, But right now we're calling them the heroes of the web here. Sean Elliott's heroes of the web and the idea is just to take
98.47999999999999,99.67999999999999, the finest
99.67999999999999,106.36, Specimens of human communication. I can find that are game related from the internet from our letters our email and letters back
106.36,111.86," And rip them the shreds no, not just read them as like as they as I find them"
112.7,118.53999999999999, Just dramatically read them indeed and so but I mean I would I think scrolled in human feces would be good
118.53999999999999,122.9," It does not the ring to it that here is the inner web does or whatever. Yeah, but if you got something"
123.46,125.74, Just give you a taste of what's the sentiment and we'll yeah
125.74,131.1," We'll we'll we'll be hitting these up as we go, but first let's go what else we got we're gonna talk about"
131.1,133.82, There were a couple announcements about games that were
134.7,139.12, both former cover stories of ours that were a big PC exclusives
139.24,144.08, We now have found are gonna be on consoles so we're gonna talk about that a little bit and why that makes us cry
145.0,147.0, Then we're gonna talk about
147.8,151.6," No, what's an a question this was Ryan's own discovery that he game that he has loved"
152.64000000000001,154.64000000000001, Loved like a sister
154.64000000000001,160.88, Is now is is has now bummed him out to the point where he wrote an angry blog about it this weekend
161.36,168.32, And so we're gonna talk about that specifically about his one experience and then if any of the rest of us have had experiences where the games
168.32,170.32, We've loved have turned us to hate
171.2,173.7, After that we're gonna share some stories about
174.72,179.44, buying games past and present was that a form question inspired topic that's no well
179.44,184.4," I just decided we needed to get topic going. Oh, you just made that one up and so but I put it on on"
184.4,188.88, It's a good arms just to just to see if you I didn't quite get their responses that I was I mean
188.88,191.88, It was kind of thinking of like when people were talking about how filthy their rooms are and stuff
191.88,192.64, Uh-huh
192.64,195.83999999999997, Just because to me I associated game I experience with just utter misery
196.0,200.79999999999998, But I mean there's there's some good commentary guy so I collected that then we've got all of our own stories to
201.11999999999998,203.11999999999998, Draw on mm-hmm indeed
203.51999999999998,208.85999999999999, Then I will be hammer a little bit about the Lord of the Rings online beta that I've been on since this weekend
208.85999999999999,213.35999999999999," I already did some of that on the a wild podcast in the past hour, but I'll do it again"
214.16,217.11999999999998, That what were you talking about Lord of the Rings online in the wild podcast?
217.92000000000002,224.04," I know well because there's a lot of similarities. Okay, if you're gonna have that podcast and you're gonna take time away"
224.04,227.28, That you could be spending with GFW. You're gonna talk about wow and only wow
228.04,232.56," Yes, you're pretty much it now was basically just to convince all the wild people to yeah"
232.56,237.68, It's it might be worth a shot and I can and it's probably your kind of game shon because you know
237.68,242.0, It's a kind of game where you like get to be a hobbit and like bake pies for other players. Okay
242.0,246.32, I walked out of the the second Lord of the Rings never saw the third one
246.32,251.07999999999998," So really maybe he's not kind of game holy shit. Okay, he loves the Tolkien"
251.72,257.28, And it's like a jam packed up. It's a jam packed up. We have so much to do we can hit all that and let's just start off with
257.96,260.48, The Spunzer writer Spunjash
260.48,267.53999999999996, He was on the one-up forms all have to cite where these come from because not we're possible getting them from one-up forms
267.53999999999996,274.82," GFW forms and if you instances from elsewhere, so in a letter in a thread titled"
275.34,280.02, Ghostwriter this game that's Ghostwriter this game GAM
280.58,281.58, GAM
281.58,286.98, It's a bunch of ashes he didn't mean it like a leg like from the 1950s movie. I don't think I should have
288.98,290.98, Games
290.98,295.53999999999996, Just right I was game me flappin anymore this game is all the hook you
295.98,300.2, You are Ghostwriter Nicholas Cage who is an action he skeleton with fire
301.14,303.14, You have a cheney whip with fire
303.94,308.02, Even indexes the bonus McGill boes and history 10 out of 10
309.5,314.9, So this one jazz he has some he has some as a dim reviewer in the making there some excellent to script the skill
314.9,319.97999999999996, There I almost arrived you need it is on slide. What is that scelty described it again?
319.97999999999996,325.34, What is action he's skeleton with fire come on that is the most you need a no of real straight
325.34,328.82, I've ever heard it is it's an action it's an actiony movie
329.74,336.28," Wait, where am I going with this okay? It's an action he's skeleton with fire with an actiony woman with breasts or"
336.28,339.2, McGumbos or whatever he calls it in an action movie with suckage
340.02,346.58," So there we go. He did it he wrote a review in about 30 words there. He did okay, so"
347.42,354.14, Moving along we don't need to deliberate too long on these unless they inspire you to I just kind of like leaving with you like a little prayer for the day
354.14,356.14, Center you
357.34,359.34, Now we can eat
360.62,365.41999999999996," Okay, so we'll start off with the quote unquote bad news. I it's not"
365.86,370.97999999999996," Sorry that this I'm maybe I'm getting numb to the fact, but anyway we learned we learned that the crossing"
371.18,379.88, Which was on our cover last month and enemy territory Quake Wars both heading to Xbox 360 right and we just but on last week's podcast
379.88,384.14, We just sort of padded activation on the back for yeah
384.14,390.58," Quake Wars the PC only triple a title yeah, and we were just not so much in this big multi-platform"
390.58,395.54, Stop being a little right to ourselves do we care it's funny?
395.54,400.42, I realized I care and it's like odd for me because normally I really just don't give it shit
400.42,404.48, And anytime I see people arguing about like we don't rest in evil came out on a
405.0,407.8, PlayStation 2 that they directly had to cut his head off
407.8,409.24, You know that crap
409.24,414.96000000000004," It's like whatever who cares I played on the one I want to play it on you know, right and of course here I'll play it on the thought I'll be playing"
414.96000000000004,418.76, I can guarantee crossing Quake Wars or the variety game. I will be playing on PC
418.96000000000004,423.68, But it's still kind of a bummer because you we need maybe it's just because I work for a PC gaming bag
424.40000000000003,427.6, It's like we need something for ourselves to say like okay
428.56,433.56," Not only is the is it the best version of the experience you know here, but it's like the only one"
433.56,437.36, Getting it. I don't know. Maybe it's just petty or like I said maybe it's just me like jobs carry your
437.36,441.32," Some no, I think it's a numbing effect like to me. It's like oh, okay"
441.32,446.16," Yeah, maybe that's it is I'm just numb to the fact that they're playing this right right right have to"
447.0,452.24," Crisis that one still ours man, but should no I mean still got crisis we've been safe in the beginning"
452.44,455.84000000000003, Crisis we know will be a version of crisis will becoming out on
456.4,462.14, Consoles are these gonna be simultaneous releases is crashing in there's no way there's no way this point because
462.7,467.02, Who knows what the crossing because it's so far out Quake Wars no chance in hell
468.46,473.21999999999997, They've been working I mean I know while it's relatively easy to port the code
473.21999999999997,478.65999999999997," Yeah, from PC to 360 and work on simultaneously in terms of the interfaces for this game"
479.53999999999996,481.53999999999996, In terms of a
481.53999999999996,482.94, In terms of in terms of in terms of
483.94,485.94, Injoo far is
486.34,488.34, Interface goes
488.5,495.53999999999996," Aiming just all the usual stuff. Yeah, that that comes into the picture when you're dealing with the first person shooter and the different interfaces"
495.9,500.29999999999995, You just control our stuff. So there's no way we'll have it and that's really what matters first
500.58,504.97999999999996, Just like you know we are going to get word is that we're gonna get gears aboard on PC
505.38,510.38, But at this point that game was in my mind that game was like made and made really well for a controller
510.38,514.1," Right, I am we've already played it there. So yeah, really that's hair when it's late"
514.1,516.5400000000001, That that's not first me first out the gate really does
517.1,523.14, Matter if you're hardcore unless you you know your tip-off advanced that there's gonna be like a significant disparity in the experiences
524.0600000000001,529.1, Just pretty rare that it worked that way like with Russ and evil was the other direction. I mean some people said they like it
529.1,531.46," It did look good for PS2 game, but it's like hey if you played"
532.02,534.74, It was out first on GameCube. It looked better
534.74,537.3000000000001, Unless you're gonna just like being internaught and argue about it endlessly
537.7,541.7, So like whatever one of these companies like say they're gonna add something for some other version
541.7,547.9000000000001, That's always some freaking you know they just throwing some they throw you some phone to make you about we put in another
547.9000000000001,551.0600000000001, There's another room you can go in if you're there's one more room
553.1,556.5400000000001, So you need that one too get that one too
557.3000000000001,561.5400000000001, Because that's a room that there's never been a room in the other one and
562.58,564.58, If you go in that room
565.86,568.4200000000001," Well, there's the monsters in there"
569.38,571.38, How long's it gonna take to get through that room?
571.38,578.12," Well, we're not really sure. We're it's gonna depend on the player. We're thinking you know might take anywhere from 10"
578.74,580.74, 15 minutes
580.74,582.74, Rain man not a lead
582.74,587.38," You're pushing you're pushing your eyeglasses to your hole in your saw. Yeah, I know"
587.38,591.5999999999999, Because disgusting foot is on the recording table. It's like I've checked to that
591.5999999999999,593.5999999999999, I've kind of got to some yeah weird
593.5999999999999,596.3399999999999, I like though. Just keep re-contentious combustion
596.34,598.34, This is how we're just turning into someone else for a second
599.02,603.7, The only way it could have went after that the only response was you guys ever thought about infinite space
605.22,607.38, Ask me well what go ahead
608.38,611.1800000000001," I just yeah, it just keeps going and it going"
613.86,616.5, So what's in the room infinite space not
617.4200000000001,621.14, But getting get that on the PS2 though you didn't get that at room
621.9399999999999,627.86," The gut yeah, you're never able to get this gun this guy made the game of 45.7% now"
628.1,629.1, Winner teeny
629.1,634.24, And if you're complete this the idea is being a complete list if you're completely just you have to have everything and there's not everything in that version
634.24,637.9399999999999," Therefore you can't have that version and call your job. Welcome, please"
638.9399999999999,645.28, Say what they're up like the third remake of Ninja Gaiden or whatever for the PS4 yeah stop it right stop
645.28,647.28, So we're
650.48,654.8399999999999, You know we are heroes multi-platform right we're losing there
654.8399999999999,662.28, So what we do which let me ask one question related to this is anybody here on this podcast gonna play Halo 2 on the PC
662.28,664.28, No
664.28,672.78, I will try it of course. We try to set a professional curiosity interest or because actually it excites you that this game is at some point
672.78,676.64, In curiosity I will I will play it if there is an extra room
679.18,684.86," Wow, no, I won't that shit works on Sean it's weird like the whole we got to have Sean"
684.86,688.88," It's in every table. Oh, it's a tough stuff. Oh, it goes it's gonna be next to room"
690.28,692.28, I'll do it can I write the preview
695.3399999999999,699.76," Yeah, we can't wait until it comes out no room that room"
700.76,705.48, The thing with the Halo and like Halo and half like they epitomized they're like the two
705.68,712.56," It's like Sonic and Mario. Yeah, it's like master chief and Gordon Freeman and we've got a bad and they're Gordon Freeman's a"
713.08,718.2," Chumper whatever, but the other guys just the jail space Marine. Well, it's like I've got a crowbar"
718.2,720.2, And I'm gonna conduct some experiments
722.2,724.2, What I like
724.2,731.2800000000001," That's my cheat. Yeah, you know, so aliens and I decided to put a cool fire got one of their costumes"
731.2800000000001,735.24, One of the trap ships and then put instead of aliens I fought the predator
735.72,739.82, That'd be pretty fun and then I stole the head crabs from half life and fought them
740.5200000000001,742.86, Because then guys in your name called then the flood
743.6,746.08, What a fun of hard as master chief
747.48,751.46," No, but anyway, I just think it off like whenever you're online and you're in your plane Halo"
751.46,755.4200000000001," It's like, yeah, this is the best freaking FPS ever made and then you're like in"
755.4200000000001,757.2, You know PC shooters like oh god
757.2,762.4200000000001, I can't believe those frickin tards are playing Halo. So good looking me I could turn this thing around like it's like
762.4200000000001,764.4200000000001, And I could shoot the guy behind me
764.86,766.86, It's like it's always
766.86,768.0600000000001, This is how it works
768.0600000000001,771.38, So we're probably again weird that it's coming out. I know it was better on PC before
771.38,777.76, It's just it's just weird to me to see like the standard bear for console FIA aggressive console FPS coming to PC
778.1,780.1," Yeah, where it's like"
780.22,787.9, It's got like built in like people based of people who despise it for the fact that like the opposition defined themselves with it
787.9,793.2, Yeah for so long the first time I ever saw Halo was on the PC way right 83
794.62,797.66," The walls just continue to break down. Yeah, I"
798.02,803.12, Eventually those be like one game box that I just need to find you guys that that Halo to for
803.3000000000001,809.4200000000001, Lot for Windows will be the only there will be the first opportunity to collect live anywhere achievement points
809.42,811.42," Yes, the achievements"
811.4599999999999,815.5799999999999, Which means a lot to me it means a lot to a lot of people. I mean
816.38,821.4599999999999, Actually went and visit you from EGM this weekend and he was playing Lord of the Rings
822.66,825.5," What's not witch king, but the Lord of the Metal"
825.5,830.18, I'm gonna let you down for a little or two on Xbox and I was like it looks kind of like a sad existence
830.18,835.5799999999999, Like what are you doing? And you know you're just sitting on there like just put her in around he seconds getting achievement was he in the center where
835.58,840.32, What's he dressed for less he got a blog about that it was like he had played it for a review
840.32,843.26, I'm like a debug unit and then lost them all and it depressed him
843.62,849.46," So he needs a lot of things I'm paraphrasing it all the exact right, you know if you actually have to check into a clinic or anything"
849.98,855.6600000000001, It's not like losing your like you know graduate diploma or something like that to some people believe me
856.1,858.0600000000001," Okay, we can we can we can"
858.0600000000001,863.38," I'm gonna miss for that I'll bring up some shit. We can't talk about this and then you bring it up. Hey guys, by the way"
863.66,869.4399999999999," We can't talk about this. Yeah. All right, so let's move on to Ryan's big moment Ryan kind of"
870.34,874.88, spontaneously combusted on on one up that calm this week. That was a great blog post
875.52,879.18, I did I saw I was I was I was patrolling that joint and I saw on the front page
879.7,883.18, Like Ryan Scott and then like dammit all the hell
883.18,884.18, I
884.18,889.96, Things up all just called God Wars can dying go to hell that is what the post was called I kind of finally snapped
890.6800000000001,893.44, This weekend after two years of Guild Wars
894.0,896.8000000000001, Just wow what did it what happened? I
897.64,904.1, I kind of played I've played that game so much that I can kind of like see the seams in the fabric finally and it
904.74,907.44, So maybe it's not a fault of the game. That's like
909.44,916.5600000000001, How many years before you saw these seams? I've been playing it since it's been so almost two years. So what what broke you finally?
917.36,919.36, Well
920.0400000000001,923.0400000000001, I was I'm in the in game area of
923.9200000000001,928.38, Guild Wars nightfall one of the in game areas called the realm of torment which is the
929.36,933.58," Well that might be part of the problem. You put one to hell. Yeah, the realm of torment. I guess"
934.96,936.96, Red floating red platforms
937.8000000000001,942.6800000000001, Just think a bunch of platforms floating over lava. You got a I know a snap out now that sure
944.6800000000001,947.32, Tell in every video John was just making it out
947.32,950.36, Hell it actually is in the game. Yeah wrong level in
951.4000000000001,955.4000000000001, The floating platform lava levels a different guy of where we caught him was the first
956.08,961.24, Game hell is platforming in the in spawn and spawn games for Xbox I played a lot of shitty games I had hell
962.0,969.0400000000001," Yeah, so I'm so I'm in the realm of torment and I'm I'm as"
970.6800000000001,974.8000000000001, You guys here know very obsessive about checking all the quests off my log
975.0799999999999,977.3599999999999, It's kind of personal OCD
977.3599999999999,979.3599999999999, Much like your chord thing
979.3599999999999,982.4399999999999," I yeah, I'm trying to work all the tangles out of this chord"
982.4399999999999,988.64," Yeah, okay, but yeah, don't do it right now while you're talking instead anyway. So that affects his chord"
989.04,992.04, So I ran all all the way across this zone
993.4399999999999,995.92, Claring out all this all these monsters along the way
996.4,998.7199999999999, So just to get to this one quest NPC
999.3199999999999,1003.06," Okay, right so he could give me this quest to do so I finally get to him"
1003.06,1007.0799999999999, It's like you know go go kill five of these things over in this other part of the zone and
1008.4399999999999,1013.0999999999999, The the five of these things that I have to kill are you know surrounded by huge mobs of
1014.0999999999999,1019.9," Trash mob 10 12 yeah, 10 12 monster to peace and it works out in such a way that like you know"
1019.9,1024.3799999999999, No matter how carefully you go and try to pull like a select few of them and pick them off
1024.3799999999999,1032.06, You know intelligently you're gonna aggro the whole okay the whole spawn right and it gets to the point where you know
1032.06,1037.08, They're killing me. I resurrect way back in the beginning of their zone with like full death penalty
1037.08,1041.8," And I'm like okay, I'm just gonna run back. I'm gonna be able to kill one"
1042.04,1046.28," Then they'll kill me again, and I'll run back and I'll just keep picking it off one by one"
1046.28,1047.6399999999999, I'll get to the end
1047.6399999999999,1048.6399999999999, I see
1048.6399999999999,1054.8799999999999," Oh, because they stayed dead when you when you've killed them right is this people so you can eventually beat him by a triton right exactly"
1054.8799999999999,1059.48, Which is like at that point I had to ask myself like why am I doing this? It was possible though
1059.48,1060.48, I
1060.72,1066.94," Was using NPCs and I admit that if I were if I were in a group, you know full of real people right"
1066.94,1068.94, It would make this task easier
1068.94,1074.24, But this is not how like you'll I mean to to be fair isn't it like world of warcraft words like you have to have a
1074.64,1080.7, Posse go role mob deep in those like 60 R8 60 men. I get that shit confused with 60 something rates
1082.44,1084.92," What's how it is? Yeah, I kind of I mean there's no real"
1084.92,1092.44," Comparison there cuz why you can't have NPCs playing for you right, but one of the whole big draws in nightfall was that"
1094.64,1098.48, Right NPCs that are it but to be fair you are at the end bot
1098.48,1104.1200000000001," I mean this is an end boss thing right so this is a normal quest. Oh, it's a normal. This isn't like a story mission"
1104.1200000000001,1110.48, This is like a normal quest would like the standard like 25 hundred experience quest reward like no different than any other quest
1110.48,1116.28," In any of the earlier zones. Okay, so you had a bad quest experience. You had a bad day. This is how an example"
1116.28,1122.0, That is this is just the point that that was the breaking. It sounds like he just need a break or just right
1122.0,1126.28, It would be right a arena that explained them that you're not putting quarters in your own PC
1126.92,1132.5," You know, I mean there. Yeah, that's like yeah quarter-eaten game player talking about. Yeah, right all of a sudden"
1132.5,1136.24, You get to the boss and it just coats the screen with so many like death balls that it's like
1136.88,1138.76, Absolutely a literally impossible. Yeah
1138.76,1142.0," That was my problem with that was my problem with a tight quest, too"
1142.0,1148.36," You know, I mean my that was my problem with the expansion was that you had the die 800 times before he could finally beat the guy and if"
1148.36,1152.08, But but like iron lore seems to sort of do that in general like with
1153.08,1157.44, With the original game they nerfed the in a in the most recent patch
1157.44,1163.8, They nerfed the not what's the opposite of the nerf they they took the end boss and we're in the infant
1163.8,1167.28, They shrimp and him so that he was that much harder
1167.6399999999999,1172.56, And he was so hard that it was like what you're saying you would like go you'd run across a thing
1172.56,1176.04, You'd get there get hit them once with your axe then you'd be dead
1176.04,1181.0, And you like scraped like one hit point off him and you know you could keep doing that forever and eventually
1181.0,1189.26, He's gonna die. Why is it like why are you doing what right why is it that like a dude can stare at the sun for a couple minutes and realize the fucking fabric
1190.26,1192.26, But it was on insanity
1192.26,1197.42, With the kids you two years it took you two years to figure out that that's bullshit that you got to like
1197.78,1203.62," Just do I mean the whole game is based on collect five scales of fardoor, you know like five tails of minigun"
1203.9,1209.26, Like five unicorn horns of tag-a-lozy good dog and it's like that's all it is for two years
1209.26,1214.54, Well guys with there's a new expansion and there's a I get a missionary collect seven organs of
1214.86,1216.86, Durga deal
1216.86,1218.86, 25
1218.86,1220.86, Tonya's a Zongozine
1221.58,1227.74," Finally though finally broke yeah, yeah wondering if it's like"
1229.9399999999998,1232.2199999999998, Seeing the seams are just being sick of them because like
1233.34,1239.6599999999999, With wow I saw the seams a while ago. I'm like okay I understand that you know this isn't necessarily the best way to design a game
1239.6599999999999,1244.8799999999999," But I'm okay with that right and also you played it like 8,000 hours to right"
1244.8799999999999,1249.12, There's a point where you just you understand the game completely and it becomes like a meta game
1249.6399999999999,1257.1599999999999," Right, that's the thing like a sign of a what did you not I mean I think it's I mean like I've just been playing it so long"
1257.1599999999999,1259.6399999999999, I've just been sort of blind to ignore it because
1260.28,1261.4399999999998, I don't want all this time
1261.4399999999998,1266.1999999999998, I did the whole the whole concept of like playing a game so much that you understood
1266.1999999999998,1270.1999999999998, You see through the tissue of it and then you begin to like realize it's not as cool as you thought
1270.1999999999998,1276.12, It's like the perfect like microscopic examples dragons layer and when you're like eight years old and you play
1276.12,1277.12," Yeah, yeah, yeah"
1277.12,1282.4399999999998, It's cartoon you put your butt in there and you're like just playing Simon says
1282.4399999999998,1286.4799999999998," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's just like the most like"
1287.1599999999999,1292.76, Ruedo Mentory you know reduction is I could version that never understand that game when I used when that game came out
1292.76,1298.84, And all my friends were obsessing over the house like man you get this was like the moonies right like how could you think this is good?
1298.84,1302.36," Right, this is totally the size of your paying to like see the next place"
1302.36,1307.08, You're gonna make them a stake so that you'll pay it again to then make it around one more corner
1307.12,1311.8," Right, you know people will do that. I think I don't know. I mean I could be talking about my ass"
1311.8,1317.1599999999999, But like I'm guessing that years later like years award to I mean a god of war two because they show
1317.8799999999999,1323.6399999999999," Everything that they try to showcase it with is that quick time event stuff. Yeah, it's basically you know drag and flare and"
1324.12,1330.08," It's like yeah, that looks great, but I think at some point those kids that weren't when we were eight and we're in arcade spending mobs buck on"
1330.08,1334.12, Something we shouldn't have been spending mobs buck on like there now spending mobs fiddy bucks
1334.12,1336.12, I know they're gonna be
1336.12,1344.28, I'll just spin in that analog steak. You didn't matter that that job was still getting ripped off the heartbeat no matter what I right I did you know
1344.8,1348.0, So I mean don't you think it's possible that you're
1348.7199999999998,1354.2399999999998," You're being overly you know, it's just like a smoker who quits and then hate smokers like don't you think you're being a little harsh"
1355.04,1359.12, Maybe you're not I don't know no on galber you're not you might be back
1359.84,1361.36, Well
1361.4399999999998,1363.84, You know you know you get bored. It's a game where like
1364.32,1368.52, You're like me you spend a lot of time. He's a person you see some McDonald's for making you fat
1372.6,1374.12, True
1374.12,1376.12, That's kind of true dude. No
1376.6399999999999,1381.04," What you've done to me? No, I mean I mean I spent I spent like a lot of time"
1381.8799999999999,1387.08, Making my character like you know the best you can be and we're being out built for my my hero in PC use because you know
1387.08,1391.08, That's what you do with them right want it to be effective and then you get into a situation like this
1391.08,1394.56," Where the the logic is just like oh, let's just throw a bunch of"
1395.6799999999998,1400.0, Powerful stuff out on that he can't possibly take it no matter what you had done to build it up
1400.0,1409.12, It's really matter. It's punishing. Yeah. It doesn't reward you in any way. Are you sure you just haven't you positive you haven't found the secret method or their secret weakness
1410.6,1414.96, Like if you would sprinkle a little unicorn oil on your swords hit them they would go down
1414.96,1416.96," Yeah, they don't hit you know"
1416.96,1418.96," Yeah, I'm pretty"
1421.08,1427.28, Sharp in your sword on the unicorn horn and you will vanquish your enemies the thing it like I made the blog post and
1429.0,1431.48, The response all the comments from a blog were like yeah
1432.24,1435.0," Yeah, how come it took you this long notice"
1435.0,1439.3999999999999," This is exactly why I quit playing Guild Wars 2. Yeah, so now you have wow"
1439.3999999999999,1444.4399999999998, You don't need Guild Wars right then a couple you're a little too whatever from the same blog about
1446.4399999999998,1448.04, This game stands to
1448.04,1449.56, Vanguard four years from the same one
1449.6399999999999,1450.6399999999999, Vanguard
1450.6399999999999,1455.08," Yeah, you are kind of like the guys the guys we get letters from the say"
1455.36,1457.56, That they're sick of this game and it stinks
1457.8799999999999,1464.84, You know or they hate this game and they can't believe that we would say this because they put in 120 hours and they know better than us
1464.84,1466.84, How bad this game is right it's like
1468.04,1472.04, If it's that bad and you're 120 hours in
1473.9199999999998,1477.72, Maybe you could have stopped at like a hundred 18 hours ago
1479.56,1481.56, Stockholms and the game
1482.36,1485.72, It's stockholms syndrome for NMO's actually you could go somewhere with that
1485.9199999999998,1489.72," You have to write it this one. Oh yeah, definitely I'm"

1698.8600000000001,1704.1000000000001, That are off weekend when out and got room in contemplation. I discovered computer games are not cool
1704.98,1709.32," It was cool to play them when they had our kids, but since playstation and 64"
1709.32,1716.46, Dreamcast crucified our kids and put her game slowly become on cool my point is this
1716.8600000000001,1721.3, Music is cool you can go out and listen to music. There's no them in the danger and uncertainty
1721.8600000000001,1723.8600000000001, You can meet the opposite sex
1724.1399999999999,1731.3, You can discuss the event as it's happening with other people and you can get into a fight or get really drunk and spew
1732.02,1734.4599999999998, Our kids had all of this. That's now it's gone
1735.1399999999999,1740.1399999999999, Now we play online online play is not cool computer games are becoming uncool
1740.6599999999999,1744.3, You know when it's getting mad when Microsoft gets involved. I love 360
1744.3,1746.3, But sorry Microsoft are not cool
1747.3,1751.62, I guess my point is that with cool comes mischief you have to be a rebel to be cool
1751.9799999999998,1757.9799999999998, There's nothing rebellious about playing computer games to friends online and with your mom and with your dad sitting down
1757.9799999999998,1760.62, Stairs watching the TV that ain't cool
1761.86,1765.58, Computer game and we'll never become mainstream unless it is perceived to be cool
1766.8999999999999,1768.8999999999999, To which
1768.8999999999999,1770.8999999999999, Xavier response
1771.2199999999998,1778.5, So you go places to get drunk ladies start fights G maybe our kids aren't cool because you got kicked out of them all you think
1779.46,1785.88, You know it's bad when Microsoft gets involved with the hell do you think all the greatest computer games of all time or based on your check-in
1786.28,1794.22, Microsoft windows or does that box you type this on it's not a PS3 or Wii is called a computer and it either runs one of two systems
1794.42,1797.58, Linux or Windows and if you don't think gaming on Windows is cool
1797.58,1799.68, Try cross compiling code module
1799.68,1804.18, Why not top of the other and dealing with driver issues just to play one game on Linux
1804.86,1806.86, It is getting a lot better
1807.6999999999998,1809.6999999999998," Wow, so he told him"
1809.6999999999998,1813.76," Wow, that's another reason why the internet and four missed sports"
1815.26,1819.6999999999998," Okay, so you go on to yeah, really that do the guy goes to arcade. I like that"
1819.6999999999998,1823.7199999999998, I know a fight. I go to drink. You're gonna write a six sex up the ladies
1826.2199999999998,1832.04," When the arcade was like kind of cool you'd go there after school, you know like the long hairs would be there"
1832.04,1834.56, spoken to cigarette and playing good old dragons layer
1834.56,1836.06, I mean
1836.2,1839.9199999999998, Maybe a fight actually I got in the fight. I got a couple fights in our kids
1839.9199999999998,1842.44, What about the guy put the quarter in front of your quarter?
1842.44,1845.44, Who knows and for like a jucking for room on track and field
1846.0,1850.06, We're both trying to play your elbows like getting in my joint so you start pushing each other
1850.06,1854.34, We're like fighting on the ground in the pizza place to guy cuz I was stop that stop that fight
1854.34,1859.54," I see but like we're at the women lounging around on frogger. Yeah, yeah, you're late. I didn't late at the pizza place"
1859.54,1861.54, Wait for
1863.78,1866.34, You weren't getting checked out while you're playing frogger
1868.34,1874.34, It is so sexy the way you got that logical stick between the butt if you sat fast with that then
1875.06,1877.78, Leave it at that you're not ASS are you?
1879.18,1886.1," So our final thing on our agenda. Yeah, we're gonna talk about it's a kind of an nostalgic podcast"
1886.1,1890.1399999999999," Yeah, we're back in the arcades back in your case cuz let's look at how where we bought games"
1890.1399999999999,1892.6999999999998, We're talking about also look at game buying past and present
1893.6999999999998,1898.74," I might have a different experience and you guys, but why don't we start with you? Oh, we'll work our way"
1899.74,1901.74, To the future we'll work our way to the present
1902.3,1908.36, Let's talk about what it's gonna be like in 10 years. So so what was it like where did you get those back where I would you kid
1908.9599999999998,1910.9599999999998, I might compete with games
1912.98,1914.98, Actually
1915.46,1917.46, Let me tell you guys
1917.46,1919.46, Where am I again?
1919.46,1922.9," No, I really to me it was just"
1923.74,1926.42, It's a matter of it going from being incredibly
1927.3,1932.34, nerdy and geeky to being a lot more mainstream now. I don't I don't and I don't think there's like a
1933.78,1935.78, Better or worse
1935.78,1938.82, aspect to it. It was just like back then I would buy them at
1939.38,1940.9, You know
1940.9,1946.94, Dedicated gaming stores it weren't like eb now. It wasn't like mid gaming store like those are you know
1946.94,1950.74, It would it would be much for like you know some doofus's hobby of store
1950.74,1954.74," Right, and he'd be selling everything from I mean those store soaks us today"
1954.74,1959.8600000000001, Right a gaming store and selling magic cards or whatever right this of course predates magic even
1960.42,1963.7, And a lot of envisioning a lot of wood panel wood panel walls
1964.42,1967.1000000000001, A lot of wood panel a lot of like cats running around in the store
1967.98,1971.4199999999998, It's stuff coming in a bag like an a little paper envelope when he hands you over the counter
1971.4199999999998,1975.74," Yeah, they were there were games bought in you bought them in in a plastic bags"
1976.62,1980.3799999999999, And got something new in I mean a lot of was that kind of situation
1980.3799999999999,1982.3799999999999, I mean we're just imagining
1982.3799999999999,1986.06, Jeff got something new and you might be interested to see what would totally be like that look
1986.06,1991.26," Oh, yeah, look at that yeah, it would be like that and in between buying you'd be sitting around talking about you know"
1991.26,1994.3, Like they have you have you checked in on a battle the ball
1994.3,1996.78, Have you been playing any board games lightly?
1996.78,2002.22," You know, I need to be sitting around and talking about comics. I mean it was not unlike being an a comic store today"
2002.3799999999999,2007.3," You know, it was much more just like you were sort of in the in the club like a chess"
2007.3,2012.26, So thing and we're a bunch of feeds passed out in the back with like magic the gathering cards
2012.26,2014.8999999999999," Like split out in their hands, but this was pretty magic"
2014.8999999999999,2019.34," So they're hanging out, but they were always like a more hammer figurines and D&D"
2019.34,2021.34," Well, yeah, yeah back then"
2022.3,2024.78, And you know it was really
2025.98,2033.4199999999998, It did feel a little bit like going to I don't know it was like walking into like a you know some like
2034.4199999999998,2036.4199999999998, Back alley like you know
2037.4199999999998,2039.4199999999998, Heroine dealer
2041.4199999999998,2043.4199999999998, Gorka pipes
2043.4199999999998,2048.46," You know, yeah, you had your like plastic bag with a computer game in it, you know"
2048.46,2052.7," He was a right-off a little 30 yeah, that little radians straight step going yeah"
2053.02,2057.66," Scott got yourself out there like double speed. Yeah, I'd be riding home on my bike on like"
2057.66,2059.66, I mean I just spent all this money
2060.66,2063.58, Look at another people like with girlfriends and stuff like feeling
2063.58,2068.7, I'm thinking you're making that part up you're probably excited like you couldn't wait to go to Earth. Of course. I couldn't
2069.98,2074.14, You and just Jeff you were just there guests today. I don't feel good about you hanging out those old guys
2074.14,2076.14," Yeah, I'm"
2076.14,2078.14, Me half cool
2079.18,2082.54, You got a special back room with games. I think you Jeff you know you're getting old enough
2082.54,2086.2999999999997, I want to show you this other games. We got I got a special game
2086.2999999999997,2089.5, You're like I'm based your life is a it's a different stroke episode
2090.14,2092.14," No, it was it was just a little more nerdy"
2092.14,2100.2999999999997, I mean I I really don't think it was all that different it was just maybe a little more nichey and a little bit more like what it's probably like for anybody who buy board games now
2100.54,2103.02, Right now it was a little more on the fringe. Yeah
2103.66,2105.02, So
2105.1,2108.86," Yeah, I'm very much picturing the board game shop pretty much and you know yep"
2109.2599999999998,2115.2599999999998, Pied with like some layers of contenders something exactly like I was like I'm guessing this is probably for you two shons
2115.2599999999998,2119.74, We're about same age like by past that phase and it was like in seers
2119.74,2124.46, It was like the seers basement so I for it all happened. That's where the metrics in the odd-a-season
2124.46,2131.78," Oh, yeah all the fun. We were going to hilly department store for our game and check it out like I remember when the master system and Nintendo Entertainment"
2131.78,2136.1400000000003, This is her first came out. I mean this was obviously added to our isn't until visions all other stuff
2136.1400000000003,2141.38, Between there now it was pretty exciting going to like the quid on the target is this place in San Diego called Jim co
2142.1400000000003,2144.1400000000003, Jim co long had a business now
2144.5,2149.6200000000003, But toys are us as used to have them too back then like they'd have the hanging little plastic things even back then
2149.6200000000003,2153.1400000000003, Toys are us yet. That was the other staple going in there looking on those things
2153.1400000000003,2155.86, But did that glass case? You looking there and see Rob?
2155.86,2161.26," Yeah, you can't touch the thing you can only look at like the replica. Yeah, and then you take your little ticket up to the window"
2161.26,2163.26," Yeah, play hooks you up"
2163.7000000000003,2169.0200000000004," Toys are us man in the business. Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of you are around the system of already closed"
2169.5400000000004,2173.1600000000003, God damn in or not and then like the idea of a game only store
2173.1600000000003,2178.6600000000003, I mean those started appearing later then there was that phase where then there was like I think that this a rebirth for me
2178.6600000000003,2184.82, And there were like a few game dedicated shops right that's what I thought I would go to those and then it was like yeah
2184.82,2188.1000000000004, Then I'm just and fun colon and stuff like that. All right
2188.74,2193.8199999999997," Right, did you don't tell me you entered entered the world in the era of the fun colons and"
2196.38,2198.74, The big game stories when I were I was younger were
2199.18,2203.96," Babages some pretty set of right yeah, yeah, were you a clear get Babages? I"
2204.46,2209.94, Was not okay. I thought you had some story before I was I worked retell it a same goody
2211.14,2213.38, That's pretty good really good music there too
2213.66,2215.3399999999997," Yeah, yeah"
2215.34,2220.94, The other the other players got by them at which the computer stores you see 20 not any like egghead yeah
2221.86,2226.38," Yeah, like dedicated small shops that were selling computers right that's the other thing"
2226.38,2231.3, It's like and the only like I was like strictly console on that it's some outside like commoner of
2231.3,2236.26," Victoney and like conversation 64 others a big gap, but then like ever going like certain like"
2236.82,2241.42, Friends house or whatever and their parents would have a Mac or whatever playing some old games the mouse on that black and white
2241.98,2247.2200000000003, Who would always scare me they seem so deep like I'll get so scared I'd get like a play like it's almost game
2247.2200000000003,2250.46," Yeah, and it'd be like just a dude maybe even know what it is a dude"
2250.46,2257.46," Well, you know green and green and black graphics go on the distraction is terror my and ruins and there'd be crocodiles and dinosaurs down there"
2257.46,2259.94, But like when I start seeing like the snakes and shit
2259.94,2263.38, I was already scared and they start doing dinosaurs that you know too much
2264.1800000000003,2267.1800000000003, I was ready for that you were like 19 then or yeah
2267.18,2269.18, It's probably like 25
2269.94,2271.94, I was still in diapers
2271.94,2278.2599999999998, At the stretch of the abstract in that area was like kind of frightening because you can make it whatever you want it like that Indian a Jones game for the Atari
2278.46,2284.58," Yeah, most freaky thing in the entire universe for some reason to me. Oh in the old dude text like now that we're showing like now"
2284.58,2288.98, We're probably seeing so young you but like the text don't lead ventures or ever just be like a little bit of like
2289.62,2293.3399999999997," Like pseudo 3D you know graphics that's like oh, but like just fecera and everything"
2293.34,2297.9," Yeah, that would scare the shit out of me. I was so like holy shit like it's talking to me"
2297.9,2300.3," You know, you want to pick up the sword up like yeah"
2301.3,2308.06," Yeah, I think I think about those early like battle zone games those things like I don't want to sound like a bad back in my day"
2308.06,2314.5, But really in my memory now those to me feel like the most immersive games I've ever played because it was like the first time
2314.5,2318.06, You had to imagine that you're yeah that your mind ever did that
2318.06,2321.58, Where you were actually you know putting yourself in some other place
2321.58,2326.14, I have very vivid memories of those kind of games right and really being lost inside them
2326.14,2329.04, I think it's been for me. It's probably just been part of being young too
2329.04,2331.94, Because like choose your own adventure books with making fuel the same way. Yeah
2331.94,2337.66, You don't bump down if I picked the wrong one and you couldn't decide whether it was like ethical to just like skip back to
2337.66,2342.62, Where I made like the shitty choice or like start the whole book over again. You had ethical dilemmas over
2344.62,2346.62, I had a
2348.06,2350.06, Back really
2350.06,2354.42, Was painful you're like that you were the self-styled hero of time now my time
2354.86,2357.02, Building it allows me to go back when necessary
2362.14,2368.7799999999997, So what about now now going into game source part of the reason I chose this is because so and we can make this PC specific
2368.7799999999997,2370.22," You know, okay now"
2370.46,2373.98, Well for one it sucks if you go into the eb games or games
2374.06,2376.38, I used to like eb but when they merged with game stop
2376.38,2383.5, I always thought a game stop is uh is it's a hybrid of three things and none of them is flattering one a pawn shop
2384.06,2388.7, And I mean just like the pawn shop where like the sorry estudes in there like turning his wedding
2388.7,2392.3, Band-in because he needs to give himself a hack a like lucky strikes or something you know
2392.94,2394.46, Then
2394.46,2398.78, An am way a friend with an am way like Jones with the offer anyway
2399.18,2403.02," You know, I got it kind of this you can yeah pyramid scheme or something"
2403.5,2407.46, And then finally a daycare center a filthy rot filthy daycare
2407.46,2410.94, Test daycare center like you know you're stepping over diapers as you're walking in and
2412.06,2415.34, I mean it just smells so bad if you pull your shirt up over your nose
2415.9,2419.58, I would also add that I would add the DMV in terms of like
2420.3,2425.5, Service and how long it takes to get in and out of the DMV known once to talk to you at the game store
2425.5,2429.74," They want to like they want to fucking be your educator. Well, do you do know it's pronounced?"
2429.8199999999997,2435.22, He'll not hide you or rice for whatever it's but I not book Kai or it's in the yes
2435.22,2437.22, Not who do not you
2437.22,2441.1, Whatever this that well they are totally the you're right about the daycare thing
2441.1,2445.16, It's totally the dropoff point mom's gonna go to Mervin so why don't you go in the game stop over here
2445.16,2448.7, And let's look to we get you know play the demos they got the kiosk
2448.7,2454.9199999999996," Yeah, every other time no matter what so I got to I feel like it just get like the worst service. I'm just like it's pre-order"
2455.56,2459.86, We don't have that in you didn't pre-order everyone knows you got everything it's all about pre-order
2459.86,2465.6800000000003," Oh my god, would you like it? Oh, so your total is 99 which like a 50 year warranty with that"
2467.6,2471.42," Every time I'm going that strategy guy. Oh, I see you're buying a Mario game"
2471.42,2474.44, Did you know Mario party 17's come out just want to pre-order that
2475.28,2479.2000000000003, Then they call you now they call you at home to say you buy the piece of shit. You get the call
2479.2000000000003,2483.3," Hey, you like in the game. Yeah, you want to bring it in and sell it back"
2483.3,2488.6600000000003," We'll give you a good deal give you $2,000 $2,996 credit so you can buy Mario party 18"
2489.38,2491.38, You know
2491.38,2495.82, You're gonna say they're like I don't know for the short stocking my purpose or something to like pump up pre-orders
2495.82,2498.6800000000003, But every time I've gone somewhere like on you know game
2498.6800000000003,2502.42, I'm excited about X comes out. I want to go over and get a lost planet or whatever
2502.6800000000003,2508.1400000000003," Go to e-be they don't have it this. Oh, you should have pre-order. I'm like yeah, I thought that's the heaven I go to they have to meet"
2508.1400000000003,2510.1400000000003, I go to
2510.14,2516.44, I go to best buy I got stacks of them everywhere do I get this count every time so I'm just I've like kind of given up
2516.44,2521.2599999999998," The max of show yeah, it's a weird it's a weird bullshit sort of industry in that way isn't it?"
2521.2599999999998,2522.94, I mean it's not that way with like
2523.5,2527.74, Whatever the new the new December a CD comes out add you get pre-order it right
2527.74,2530.5, I mean it's going to a goddamn store and buy the CD
2530.5,2534.3199999999997," Yeah, they can parts come in back. Did you know Lincoln party they were hot before they're coming back? They kind of knew one"
2534.3199999999997,2537.1," Do you want to pre-order you want to warranty for that? Yeah, they're all this weird"
2537.1,2539.94, You're being gratified. Did you snap it half I might happen
2541.06,2544.86," Yeah, just tell me the game it's bad in that and but even worse"
2544.86,2548.7, I mean part of the whole thing with the games for Windows initiative is that we're going to have these
2549.22,2553.9, I mean because the PC games all go on these shelves in the middle and they're all
2555.2999999999997,2561.54, Positioned to save space so all you see is the spine right right and they're all totally half hazard and some of them
2561.54,2566.98, Like 1990 this is the weirdest mix of what's Tycoon right of chess tycoon with
2567.34,2571.94, You know company here is or whatever right it's treated like a bargain bin even though it's not
2572.34,2577.22," Yeah, so you have like the brand new releases right next to them. I'll set shit set shovel where"
2578.1,2582.5, 8 Sudoku games right right in one in ball in
2583.14,2585.14, 25 tape pinball tables
2585.14,2589.46, It's like stuff that would be like it to check out standard office depot or something
2589.54,2593.26," Yeah, so a lot of like people when you quiz people"
2594.94,2598.86," Sort of agreed I must have said that yeah, you don't if you're a PC gamer"
2598.86,2603.7400000000002, You don't really buy your PC games at one of the specialty shops right you end up going to some of them
2603.7400000000002,2609.94, We're really happy with like best buys and circuit cities because it was clean this tidy things were organized by genre
2609.94,2614.14," Instead of just being like turn sideways, you know like you could find hard core stuff"
2614.14,2617.94, You wanted that was actually labeled so they have the stuff for a casual games
2618.5,2624.18," Others still weren't so happy with that or they liked it, but they what they didn't like was that it was all based on recent product"
2624.18,2629.06," And it's almost impossible to buy stuff that goes back, you know beyond a certain date"
2631.02,2636.3," So of course, but everyone seems to like when it comes to PC is but you know buying stuff online"
2636.3,2638.3," Yeah, steaming stuff and yeah"
2639.3,2643.5, Maybe that one other since we were running out of the last cool interesting thing on that for me
2643.5,2650.22, A lot of people were mentioned that Blizzard needs to go and get get their junk together in some way that like Val has was steam
2650.22,2653.5, There's people that took one guy took a photo yet four copies of a
2654.62,2656.46, Four craft three because it kept losing the key
2657.66,2662.82," Don't fall to that but like right, but it's like yeah, I mean that that isn't ever you know something"
2662.82,2665.84, I have to worry about when you get a steam game or something right I
2666.78,2668.78, Look forward to all digital only
2669.98,2672.54, This is the future. There's the future with my music to
2673.2599999999998,2674.54, All digital
2674.54,2675.82, We all
2675.82,2677.58, Aren't you already there with your music for?
2677.58,2683.42, Not really I went to a meba records in Berkeley this weekend and I bought three CDs because they were both they were all cheap
2684.06,2686.38, Three CDs they were both cheap. That's nice
2687.66,2689.1, Time to go back to mouth-cloth
2689.1,2691.34, He's a reader start writing me some letters for me to read
2691.9,2696.62," Yeah, but they were they were cheap so I bought him because they were only like five bucks a piece"
2696.62,2699.66, But the first thing I did was I burn them and then I'll never play them again now
2700.62,2703.02, So now that now just more plastic
2703.02,2708.62," I'm a house yeah, that's what I mean. I'll play them music a lot of people like this is totally like"
2709.18,2716.54," Left field now, but I mean there could be a point when you will be glad to have the CD because everyone's gonna realize that like the quality of MP3s"
2716.54,2721.58, Actually horrendous when something better comes along and they're gonna be like I have nothing to show for it
2721.58,2725.42," Some all these like really shit quality MP3s. Well, I'm just real"
2725.42,2728.7000000000003," My part of crashing then yeah, done the quality"
2729.7400000000002,2735.66," I mean yeah, I'm not gonna be one of those audio fog guys who's like you know the symbol the symbols right"
2736.86,2740.38, On rest never sleep right so much better on vinyl
2740.94,2745.1800000000003, This is like the isn't that camp yeah always I mean every little thing and I'm like a man
2745.1800000000003,2748.2200000000003, It's only a Philstein because it still sounds good and right
2750.06,2752.06, So I wanted to
2752.06,2754.06, Can we switch topics go ahead
2754.38,2757.58, I spent a bunch of time on Lord of the Rings online this week
2758.46,2765.82," I got myself onto the closed beta and Sean I think you got on there too, right, but you just barely I barely spare the surface yeah"
2765.82,2767.82, good alert and
2767.82,2772.14, And I was liking what I saw so far which which kind of surprised me
2773.2599999999998,2775.2599999999998, Let's been in development how long?
2775.66,2777.66, Actually since 1998
2778.7,2783.5, Is wow this game of hers nine years nine years it's switched publishers at least one
2783.5,2787.5," Yeah, it's gonna it's undergone a lot of yeah, it started as middle earth online"
2788.38,2793.58, This was before the first move way before that was even you know the hint of a movie version of this
2794.7,2797.5, Being done by Sierra back when they still existed the first time
2798.86,2802.3, And don't exist anymore there's no there's no second time right
2804.22,2806.22, If you're not
2806.62,2812.06, So they worked on it for years and then they turbine got involved and turbine is made Ashrod's call one and two
2813.02,2817.2599999999998, And does it a dragon song line they got involved and I think it in around
2818.06,2824.06, 2003 and now it's there's only and it has nothing to do with the vending in in fact midway is publishing it and
2825.02,2832.7, I was a big fan of Ashrod's call one actually I thought that that was one of the first of that kind of first generation MMOs
2832.7,2837.1, That was it was smooth and it got a lot of things right but since then
2838.94,2840.94, Not really the biggest fan of
2841.58,2843.58, Either ac2 or
2843.58,2847.7400000000002, Dungeon dragons online so I didn't go into this with very high hopes and plus
2848.46,2849.66," You know, I mean"
2850.2200000000003,2856.54, Really all our experience with like every licensed MMO so far is not been exactly that great and
2858.78,2859.82, And
2859.82,2866.78, On top of all that if you're gonna take a license MMO well or the rings you know it's yet another fantasy what granted
2866.78,2871.02, It's like the fantasy world right that many of us were weened on but still
2871.6600000000003,2877.1800000000003, Even though it's middle earth did we really need middle earth online when we have asarath and
2877.98,2883.34," I forget the name of all these other fantasy worlds, but but you know what I mean like my deal with these licensed"
2883.9,2889.26, License games yeah have like this set universe is like it's I find it limiting like in one regard
2889.26,2891.26," Yeah, you can tell me if this is true or not"
2891.82,2897.1000000000004, Like I know in middle earth that magic is limited to like you know not many people like again
2897.1000000000004,2901.1000000000004, I'll can do it and a couple other people to do it everyone else is pretty mundane and in that right
2901.1000000000004,2904.6200000000003, My Hobbit can never learn like I'll Jedi argument all over again
2904.6200000000003,2911.42, What is kind of the Jedi argument and and also there's a case that there because they're setting this at the time of the Lord of the Rings
2912.6200000000003,2920.0600000000004," Books at the time of of the era of Frodo and all that way this back in real quick. Yeah, I just said like so so chill"
2920.06,2924.86, So it's just straight up like sounds like that Jedi argument it is well think about that
2928.86,2934.2999999999997, What you like one I gotta have we gotta have some some I don't got a laugh at that
2935.34,2941.34," Well the sad thing is I'm your shorthand there. Yeah, yeah, it totally is like that"
2941.34,2946.22, There's gonna be people arguing that that they you know that they want to be a white wizard like Gandalf
2947.18,2951.58, But all that they I don't everyone now there are too many white wizard
2951.58,2957.66, I had to work you know hours now as I spent at a good 300 hours in order to become a white wizard now this guy gets in 12 hours
2957.66,2963.02, And he's a white wizard too. I mean that's well like personally like argument I always play spellcasters in these kind of games
2963.02,2967.74, Because I like to watch you know crazy spells go off. It's really you know that's about it. That's what it boils down to
2969.3399999999997,2973.3399999999997, So I do like colors. I do like colors. That's why like the work
2973.58,2976.6200000000003, And this is my favorite color
2978.2200000000003,2982.6200000000003," But yeah, I mean it's all basically just like different skins on the map anyway, so right"
2984.3,2986.3, When I look at the Lord of the Rings
2986.7000000000003,2990.38," Caratres like they don't really see anything that pops out is like oh, yeah, that's the kind of pla-class"
2990.38,2997.5," I like to play right like and there's some that are like like it's the lore master. Yeah, they kind of skate around the idea of magic"
2997.5,3001.1800000000003, Like you have your lore master and you have your menstrual
3001.66,3006.22," So I would talk about this on the wild podcast, but you heal people by playing your loot so"
3007.5,3010.8599999999997, You know that's how you that's how they get around the no magic rule
3011.1,3016.54, But but my my biggest concern before I played was that like like I wondered why they'd into like
3016.54,3019.8999999999996, Bioware did with the Star Wars franchise and just go you know
3019.8999999999996,3023.4199999999996, We're not gonna fuck around with like Luke and Leia and all that because it's just too
3023.58,3027.2599999999998, It's been too done we don't want to be stuck in that storyline so we're gonna set this like
3027.5800000000004,3033.98, Five thousand years in the past you know like with Lord of the Rings they had tokens whole universe that he had mapped out
3033.98,3040.2200000000003, And I wondered why didn't they just set this like before or after the Lord of the Rings part so that they weren't trapped by
3040.78,3043.26, This one story that we all know in and out
3043.7400000000002,3046.78," Well, I think that's because they kind of said like well you got to meet Gandalf"
3046.78,3049.98, You can't play this for that right. I think they were going for the low hanging fruit there
3049.98,3054.5400000000004," They wanted they wanted it to be a game or yeah, you get to meet Gandalf right, but"
3055.5,3059.34, Having said that like now my experience with that is cool cuz like I got to meet Gandalf
3061.02,3064.54, Just who's that cool do anymore it's like I like
3065.02,3070.06, I don't got dark. I met Gaffer. No exactly like how many times if you go back to get all of them by now
3070.06,3073.66, If you go back to the Star Wars analogy like in Galaxies including the fake ass
3073.66,3078.7," Everybody from fantasy that was the other rings right, but I met Gaffer Gamjito. That's totally different"
3079.66,3081.66, I'll make me sick
3082.62,3084.62, Those words are nauseating
3085.8199999999997,3088.22," No, I am I am you know"
3088.22,3095.66, I've played a lot of these animals and the thing that that I'm finding so far so far and it's early on the turbine is nailing
3095.66,3099.1, Is there just kind of nailing a good sweet spot of
3100.14,3102.14, quest structure and loot and
3103.5,3106.7, Experience you know it's a it's a undefineable
3106.9399999999996,3112.7, Formula I mean I talked about this in my Titan quest review too that like either a game has it or they don't you know either
3113.2599999999998,3116.8599999999997, Either they they've hit on a carrot and stick thing or they have not and
3117.58,3124.22, I feel like so far turbine is showing that they're getting the reward you know the work versus reward
3125.18,3127.18, thing right yeah
3127.18,3129.18, The art style something that I'm
3129.5,3132.22, You know maybe I'm having starting the Stockholm syndrome
3132.7799999999997,3139.4199999999996," But it is growing on me, but it's hot actually we got to keep that because that that's hot enough to like it's a shame if that doesn't"
3139.4199999999996,3140.7, Preliferase and go somewhere
3140.7,3142.7, It has definitely been an argument though in the end
3142.7,3144.7, I'll credit to Sean Malois
3144.7,3148.7," Friendly Stockholm syndrome yeah, and yeah because and then and that's you know"
3148.7,3150.7, We've talked about this before with MMOs
3150.7,3156.14, with in terms of Vanguard or everquest before like the idea that you can have a quote unquote realistic
3156.14,3159.5, Environment versus wild cartony environment you know
3159.98,3165.42, Like whether you know what you know does the realism quote unquote realism actually buy
3165.42,3171.1, Anything doesn't make it more immersive or doesn't make it less immersive because I might argue that it makes it less immersive
3171.1,3173.9, Well here it all it's a bigger and you know
3174.22,3176.86, I don't think anyone's gotten realism right anyway
3176.86,3183.02, I find it a real some of my contemporary tool in games it's like realism last you about three months
3183.82,3189.02, You know right and I find I find it if they get anything wrong at all it like destroys the whole thing
3189.5,3192.94, You know if they have like weird lips or their arms are hanging a weird way yeah
3192.94,3198.54, For guys supposed to be like real but then he starts talking like that's one thing in the in the riddic game as much as I like it
3198.78,3201.82, It's like the whole cast is composed of like the burn word or something
3203.26,3209.98," Come up melted ass mannequins, you know like or see us so in left. Oh you left the wax mannequin by the oven again"
3209.98,3211.02," Yeah, I'm stopping talks"
3211.02,3215.74," I'm a blivians a lot of but like that too. Yeah, they look realistic, but then when they start to oh"
3215.8199999999997,3220.3799999999997," Lovians absolutely that way. Yeah, yeah, it's like thing going on with their mouth mix of uh"
3220.7799999999997,3223.02, You know superfluous 23rd chromosomes and
3224.06,3227.2599999999998," All sorts of stuff and then yeah, yeah, but it was a little way overrated"
3227.2599999999998,3233.8199999999997," But I did mention on the wild podcast, but there's just weird thing going on in the in the in the Lord of the Rings chat channel with people like you know"
3233.8199999999997,3235.8199999999997, This is so much more realistic than wow
3236.4599999999996,3238.4599999999996, I would never play that cartoon
3238.4599999999996,3239.8199999999997, You know like
3239.9799999999996,3243.18, These are 3D graphics dude you're looking at a cartoon too
3243.58,3246.62," Yeah, it's someone drew these graphics as well"
3248.22,3253.4199999999996, It looks so real. These are all these are all cartoons. You're not in middle or it really looks like
3253.4199999999996,3255.8199999999997, I mean you should just ruin it and make some like just
3256.22,3259.5, We're tarded looking goofy character looks like a furrier
3259.5,3260.22, I did
3260.22,3261.4199999999996, I
3261.4199999999996,3264.14, I have my Hobbit's body shape. I gave him the worst the fattest
3264.14,3267.58, Cry for secution if anyone yells at you for looking so stupid
3268.46,3272.54," Yeah, I am liking the game though, but it remains recene also there's a scary amount of role players on"
3272.62,3275.9, I'm hoping that this just goes the close beta so they're enthusiastic
3275.9,3279.18," Yeah, and there's receries. We are doesn't it doesn't it"
3280.46,3288.38," In force certain naming restrictions based on like they suggest them yeah, but you still people you still find people getting away around it"
3288.38,3290.38," You know they always will yeah, of course"
3290.7,3293.74," Yeah, so how's it? How's it better than wow? How's it different than wow?"
3293.74,3297.2599999999998," I'd say it's better than wow. Okay. Well, it's not go crazy. How's it different than wow?"
3298.0600000000004,3304.46," What are we getting? Well, it's very wow like so you're they have definitely looked at wow and"
3304.46,3310.7000000000003," Seeing you know, which is not a dumb thing to do if you're liking an MMO and there's one out there that has eight million subscribers"
3311.1000000000004,3313.1000000000004," Okay, we're running out of time, but"
3313.82,3315.82, So the basic idea of you know
3317.1000000000004,3322.1400000000003, What they took was like there's always a hundred quests to do so you have a lot to do as soon as you get into a new zone
3322.38,3326.86," They give you a ton of stuff to do they send you all that a hundred quests, but we've been over this already right"
3326.94,3333.6600000000003, Click five of these 10 of these for the most part. They've got some that are a little better than right they tried to come up with some like you know
3333.6600000000003,3337.7400000000002, You got a I just want to put it perspective. It's not like when when someone's like
3338.38,3342.3, Jeff did you collect ten apples we got a CD with like the songs but every song
3342.3,3347.34," Yeah, I collect a ten apples for Gaffer game. That's what I that's how I did my part to fight so"
3347.34,3350.46, I think apples up off the ground yeah for game gee
3351.7400000000002,3355.58," So yes, those quests are the same, but they but they added some some like"
3356.2999999999997,3362.06," Some time quests and so I mean yeah, they're variations on a theme the things that I found that were different that are interesting"
3362.06,3365.2599999999998, They added their no-all turnatives and then in those space to that anyways
3365.2599999999998,3371.74," No, well the promise at when they try they fail right and even this game admitted in the characters selection just like tank"
3372.54,3373.58, You're right right
3373.58,3377.8199999999997, I'm gonna gladly hear and then they're just they you know have a little description and then right underneath that says tank right
3377.8199999999997,3380.86," Just he kind of something like it's just giving up just yeah, by the way. It's a tank. Yeah"
3381.1800000000003,3388.94," Right, you know what why not do that right there's basically going to have to do it otherwise and I wouldn't even know how to begin to right"
3390.3,3392.38, You know whether this can whether it can
3393.1800000000003,3396.7000000000003, It's it's not gonna get wilds numbers. I mean no game is gonna get wilds numbers
3396.7000000000003,3399.82," I think wow, it's probably like a once in a lifetime phenomenon here"
3399.9,3403.58, But I think but this one I think actually does
3404.38,3407.42, air on the side of being fun rather than

3609.5,3613.42, It's a little specific his taste. I like food pizza rice and much more so good in fresh food
3613.98,3617.42, I agree so that guy's a classic his is
3617.9,3623.1800000000003, Codable and anything he does anything he says so I'm sure we'll hear more from Wolfman forever now

3631.58,3635.26," Just came to the GFW mail box. Yeah, got in her mail today. All right"
3637.02,3643.1, I read with interest there are a view of rainbow six Vegas by John Davis and there's only one thing missing. I think and that is any
3643.1,3647.8199999999997, mentioned whatsoever about the in-game advertising why not are you inclusion with the marketing pigs
3647.8199999999997,3651.74, You seek to desecrate our games through advertising pollution apparently so
3651.9,3657.9, And this is why none of your views can be trusted by serious gamers the Steve system requirements of rainbow six only serious gamers
3657.9,3663.8199999999997, But have a machine capable of playing it and here's the deal my alien area 51 is now two years old and
3663.8199999999997,3666.46," I was going to buy a new one in six or seven months, but not now"
3666.46,3671.58, I'm not going to pay several thousand dollars for a new PC game so some advertising pig can put ads on it
3672.06,3675.98, So you may think that by not mentioning the in-game ads that I can be tricked into buying this game
3676.14,3682.22, What is it your interest in deceiving your readership? Maybe the fucking bastards that you be soft will hold advertising for your magazine
3682.2999999999997,3687.58, Not only are these assholes getting money for placing advertising games are still charging the same robust price for the game anyway
3687.58,3691.18, And even at the same high cost inclusion of a true-servatizing these
3691.8199999999997,3696.2999999999997, I put out a game with bugs and it needs to be patched piss on these criminals that you be soft
3696.6200000000003,3703.02, This dishonesty while a trickle down effect not only will I not buy any game with advertising all will not need the hardware to play it
3703.02,3709.7400000000002, And this means goodbye in video goodbye creative labs good buy course there good buy alien where good buy until goodbye
3709.7400000000002,3716.1400000000003, Logitech goodbye mobile manufacturer good buy any gaming magazine that this is a party to rip off its gamers
3716.7000000000003,3721.9, Signed Robert Matthews and he he says PS if you have the email address if you be soft
3722.0600000000004,3723.7400000000002, Please feel free to forward this to them
3723.8999999999996,3726.2999999999997, So thank you fly off the handle superman
3727.3399999999997,3729.3399999999997, Jeff you
3729.3399999999997,3735.8999999999996, You said the one option with this guy would be there to email him as you saw often do with with readers of this kind and say
3736.4599999999996,3739.1," Like hey, we have a misunderstanding"
3739.1,3741.4199999999996, I'm with you. I don't like ads in games. Uh-huh
3741.66,3744.06, So then usually they right back and ask for if they can work here
3745.58,3749.5," So it's just I'm always like your stuff. It's just a quick like yeah, yeah if I didn't I"
3749.98,3755.9," Take it away. What were yeah, yeah, thanks for writing I I guess I was a little angry. Yeah, oh well"
3757.42,3763.5," He says that no, I you know look his you know in game advertising is annoying"
3763.66,3769.1, It is I mean we're all but we're all sort of it's kind of like but then to just start writing like the
3769.34,3772.86," The slippery slope question air for the kids and logic one-o-one, you know at the end"
3773.42,3777.26," Can you identify the logical fallacy in the following argument? Yeah, well"
3777.26,3783.98," He doesn't have to go world the sky is falling because well, okay, he got a little upset and that's probably the first draft of his letter"
3783.98,3787.1000000000004," If he probably gave it a second draft, he he might tone it down a little bit"
3787.1000000000004,3789.9, Realized he didn't want to actually sell his entire computer
3789.98,3795.0200000000004, He would take out course air in Alienware. They might survive the creative labs until we start certainly not going to
3795.5800000000004,3801.1800000000003," Logs to the notion I mean where we are kind of at a time here, but the notion that we like wouldn't mention something like that"
3801.8999999999996,3807.74, In a review because we're in collusion with the advertiser is a fairly ludicrous notion
3807.74,3809.98," I think you know, I mean first of all"
3810.46,3815.74, You know we can't mention every single thing in every review about what is a good and what is bad about a thing
3815.74,3820.3799999999997, So it's entirely possible. I can't read John Davis's mind whether that even came up as an issue for him
3820.3799999999997,3824.7, It's entirely possible it wasn't an issue for him because for a lot of us it isn't I mean
3824.7,3828.54, I don't know at this point if I would bitch about in-game advertising unless it was something
3829.02,3834.38, Especially if it was in like a real-world text if you're in law context exactly better expect to see some advertising
3834.38,3839.42," Well right, and that's where it is right. This was Rainbow Six Vegas. Yeah, so we saw an ad like Vegas is all ads"
3839.74,3842.42, So I don't really you know that doesn't really bother you
3842.42,3847.1," I'll lost Vegas, but if I walk past it never been the last Vegas, but there's sure is hell better not be advertising"
3847.74,3852.38, But if I walk pack a McDonald signed an azure off on I'd be kind of annoyed you know
3853.18,3855.18, So I
3855.18,3859.58, On that note on that out we are done we're done and in in rage and fury
3860.06,3866.62," Darren hope you're having an ice honeymoon. Yes, thank you. I should all are SDA will listen well. I'll see you next week"
