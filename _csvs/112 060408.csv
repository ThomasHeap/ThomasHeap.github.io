0.0,7.44, Hello and welcome to the June 4th edition of Jeff W. radio. Jeff Green is away for the
7.44,14.24, game. He's enabled to host this podcast. So I'm doing it in this place. And I'm joined
14.24,23.04, by in the following order for my hands. God Robert Ashley. Sean Elliott. Sean
23.04,28.16," Moli. And today's show is going to be short and I don't even because Jeff's not with us,"
28.16,33.92, but because we just got done taping another segment on Don and War 2 that's going up on Friday.
33.92,38.0, So rather than look at it is just getting a single short show on Thursday. I think it
38.0,42.239999999999995," is a two-part show where you get to hear it Thursday. Yeah, right. I assemble it later on your own."
42.239999999999995,49.2," It's like a project. With that, I want to jump right into a thank you to a listener. We have this"
49.2,55.68000000000001, thing where we like to receive candy from parts of the world outside the universe. And yeah.
55.68000000000001,61.120000000000005," Or in this case within the United States as long as it's Puerto Rico. So we get alert and says,"
61.120000000000005,66.4," Jeff W. Thanks to Mr. Bush. I have 600 bucks to spend on candy and I live in Puerto Rico,"
66.4,70.72, which is neither a state of the union. Still he gave me cash. Here's some candy for me.
72.72,76.64, He didn't leave his name. He left his Xbox Game of Teg. I don't know if he wants me to read that.
76.64,83.76, So I'll just say it without the whole thing. We'll calm seal. So thanks so much. The candy was awesome.
83.76,86.88, I'll talk about that real quick in a minute. But then he also adds PS. I got some Puerto
86.88,92.72, Reek and Run with Ryan's name on it. He'll be talking like Al Pacino in no time. Sorry for not
92.72,98.4," buying GFW magazine. We don't get the magazine here but I love the podcast. So yeah, thanks for the"
98.4,105.44, candy. Puerto Rico candy is different. It's a lot more natural than the gummies and the sour stuff
105.52,110.32, for mouse wear. It's just like there's never more than two ingredients and one greens always sugar.
110.32,116.8," So it's like he's coconut bars really good. It's coconut sugar. Yeah, there's like sweet potato balls,"
116.8,122.32," sweet potato, I sugar. Oh, wait, wait. What was the sweet potato aspect? Was it like a sweet potato,"
122.32,127.84, like cooked like a mash kind of thing? And they were just like these like balls. They actually
127.84,133.52, looked like little turds almost. That's appetizing. That's true. Kind of very appetizing.
133.60000000000002,139.44," Herpilished turds. Yeah. It those were good. I read. I read some sesame, you know, some"
139.44,144.88, some sesame seed glued together with some sugar and that was good. The one that got a little
144.88,151.44, funky was there were these um how to describe it. It was like a construction construction paper
152.08,157.68, cone cups. In the way that you'd make like yourself a paper drinking cup or gummy in school for the
157.68,162.16000000000003, hell of it for water and it you can get like all one drink for the bottom falls out. So imagine
162.16,166.48, one of those and that's your candy wrapper and it's just it was just corn and sugar in it.
166.48,172.64," But when you eat it, it tastes like sawdust or something. It's like eating cat litter in that the moment"
173.68,178.48, drops in your mouth. It's like you the red glass of water. 600 bombs or something. Like you just
178.48,186.88," have no no saliva or anything. And wait, what was the consistency? Like I said imagine, yeah,"
186.88,191.68," it was powder. So imagine like concrete mix, cat litter or sawdust. Any kind of thing like that"
191.68,195.36, that will soak up that will quickly soak up. It's like eating like raw metamusel.
197.36,202.0, The doubt is to keep coming back like any of the work and it was bad and then I tried to give it.
202.0,206.88," I tried to give it to people around and no offense man. And if sealed, this is your favorite candy"
206.88,211.52, Puerto Rico no offense. I'm guessing you probably just get like stickers and stuff though and you got this for
212.4,216.0," quality. Yeah, for the knock. It's not wicked. It's not wicked. But if you like it, no offense."
216.0,218.88, These flies to next time. You're supposed to put it in water.
218.88,223.92," Yeah, that's the thing that's struck. Think about candy is you can like it or you can't."
223.92,227.92," I mean, yeah, that's where you gave me one of those and you're like, try this is good."
228.48,232.16, That's when you know not to. I tried to give it to everyone in the office and every time I'd
232.16,235.51999999999998," go up to someone they would like you like no thanks. I'll be like, why? No, like,"
235.51999999999998,241.2, maybe because you have a fucking reputation. That was going to buy your shit eating green on my face.
241.2,244.64," Well, this is the last time you went around the office given away good candy."
244.79999999999998,248.64," You know, dude, you're just really good candy that I'm totally not going to eat myself."
248.64,254.72, I didn't. I ate it in front of people and from a Scottish sharky and I got him to try like half a little bit.
254.72,259.2," But even that most people just wouldn't even do it. Anthony dried some and I was like, dude,"
259.2,264.15999999999997," your tongue is not going to turn black. Your mouth's not going to burn. Like, whether it's not you're not going to get diarrhea."
264.15999999999997,268.64, Just do it. They wouldn't do it. This is the presentation. Like if you should have brought one here.
268.64,274.24, I would try it. I would have tried it on the show. If you had invited people to come into your office and just had an
274.24,278.32," array of candies, a bit of people would have tried it. But if you walk up specifically with one candy,"
278.32,284.72," like, hey, I tried some unwrap to candy. Like, before the more sincere you are with something like"
284.72,292.96000000000004," random, the more I know that you're not really sincere. So it's a trick. Thanks for the candy and"
292.96000000000004,299.2," keep sending it to us. And so let's, we got a lot to talk about. Jeff, would say, obviously."
300.15999999999997,304.15999999999997, I want to start talking about the games who played in Robert. I know you played Trials 2.
304.15999999999997,310.47999999999996," Yeah, as a vibe. Just came out of Steam. Eight dollars. Trials 2. And it's a fitting name."
310.47999999999996,314.71999999999997, It's as fitting in names. And it's the most like accurately named game probably.
314.71999999999997,318.96, It sounds like a little bit of a risk by the title. I would guess it is just like a pure game.
318.96,328.8," Oh, yeah. It's, well, I mean, basically. It's a, it's a motorcycle sort of stunt platforming game."
328.88,333.92, Sort of all physics based. Imagine pitching this as you describe it. Yeah. It's 2D.
333.92,339.2," Basically, although you can go into it. But it's three graphics, three different graphics. Yeah."
339.84000000000003,346.40000000000003," But yeah, it's sort of you, you've got a sort of a trial bike motorcycle. And they set up all"
346.40000000000003,351.92, these different courses of ramps and all kinds of obstacles and stuff. And the game wants you
351.92,360.08000000000004," to use this pretty, you know, serious physics to get across these obstacles. And yeah. And I,"
360.08000000000004,364.8," you know, I downloaded, before it was on Steam, I downloaded the trial version because I remember reading"
364.8,370.0," it in a trial trial. Yeah, exactly. Because the rock paper shotgun was, I had a mega hard"
370.0,374.8, hard on for it. And I tried to thing well back. And I liked it. But I didn't download it. And then
374.8,380.56," so it came on Steam. And I, and I obsessively got into the game. This is what happens."
380.64,386.24," Nearly, nearly entirely because I'm such a glutton for punishment. It's really, it's like,"
386.24,390.4," you know, like unplossed. Ryan's thing for like collecting stuff. Like, you know, you,"
390.4,394.48," you had to get your achievements. Like, I'm like that when it comes to like, finishing, you know,"
394.48,400.0," like, you know, your achievements and team fortress. Oh, yeah. I'm like that except I'm compulsive"
400.0,406.48, about completing something that is retardedly difficult. And the game encourages it because
406.48,411.6, it can sort of let you reset at any point in these race tracks there. The is a little like
411.6,417.04," check points that when you cross them, you can reset back there and try the same jump over and over and"
417.04,424.24," over again. And I, I mean, I just succeed in the smallest increments possible and feel okay about it,"
424.24,429.6," too, right? So say if if a single course, like, and it says again, the whole thing is viewed from the"
429.6,434.08000000000004," side. It's 3D engine, but you're only able to, you can, you can, this is called front loading a"
434.08,437.76," back loading, I believe, in motorcycle terms, I'm probably, probably, I know loading is involved in"
437.76,441.59999999999997," it, but you basically lean forward or just your weight to the back of the bike. Those are options."
443.44,446.64," And when you're in the air, of course, that will control, like if you're, you know, your bikes"
446.64,450.88, going to tumble forward or backwards and then acceleration and breaking. And you basically just go
450.88,456.56," from the left of the screen, eventually to the right, but across the number of like, just grueling"
457.12,461.12, challenges where you might have to jump something. And there's no way you're going to just basically
461.2,464.88, hit a ramp and land on something else. What's going to happen is that you'll get your front wheel.
464.88,470.56," If you're angled enough back, your front wheel will hit the, uh, the top of the, the next landing platform."
470.56,474.8, And you're back wheel will kind of be down on the side. And you'll have to use the momentum of that
474.8,480.48," to haul itself up over the ledge onto the next thing later on. There's like, it's saying loop"
480.48,484.88," the loops and when you come out of them, you need to be crouched down so that as you pass through."
484.88,488.8," So say, say, you do a loop and you pass through the exit tunnel, your head's going to get taken off."
488.8,492.8," If you don't duck down. Yeah. So you think that you're like, okay, that's cool. And then like something"
492.8,497.12, always goes wrong. But although that level that you're talking about is probably my favorite level
497.12,502.0," in the game that I've played. I think you're talking about, uh, don't, or where's the ground. I think"
502.0,505.84000000000003, it's one of the medium levels. Yeah. And I actually played that one like five times because it got to the
505.84000000000003,511.2, point where I could actually just get the all the way through that ever stop it. Yeah. And if it was really fun.
511.2,517.2," Like that is, it has a really cool jumps and stuff. But part of like the, the hard time I had with"
517.2,522.88," the game, when I first started, aside from the fact that the tutorial is like to use the shitty"
522.88,529.5200000000001," pun, like the difficulty ramps up. Oh, but like the tutorial, like absolutely does not understand"
529.5200000000001,533.6, the purpose of a tutorial to ease someone into something and a challenge that's going to
533.6,538.5600000000001," come increasingly, you know, difficult. And it throws you at stuff. And I was ready to uninstall"
538.5600000000001,544.5600000000001," after giving up on like one of the later tutorial parts. Yeah. And but later on though, when"
544.56,549.28," when you hit it, like, okay, I get this. Here's a bike. And here's this crazy corkscrew thing. It kind of"
549.28,554.4," looks, it kind of reminds me a little bit of, uh, what's the flash game that's now coming to consoles"
554.4,558.64," where you're on a little bit. Line right. Line right. Yeah. And like, maybe it's just about fluidly"
558.64,563.92," finding some path through here. But then it does have this, you know, in the tutorial thing,"
563.92,569.52," you can watch a demonstration run. And when you do it, it will not only show the bike navigating"
569.52,574.0799999999999," it, but it will have the keys illuminate on the screen and let you know exactly when they're"
574.1600000000001,578.0, leaning forward by how much when they're like hitting the brakes when they're going back. And you
578.0,583.12," watch it. And it was just this really interrupted ride, whereas always punctuated by full stops."
583.12,588.4000000000001," Like you hit a jump, boom, hit the brakes stop, adjust, prepare yourself. Go to the next one."
588.4000000000001,592.88," Yeah. And and I was like, okay, that's a different way of looking at it. And then when I started"
592.88,598.4000000000001," to play it, yeah, like there were times when, because for the most part, I'll never do more than like"
598.4000000000001,602.8000000000001, hit two or three checkpoints at a time without having to try and try again. When you do
602.8,607.8399999999999," what you're like, okay, that's good. But most of the time, I mean, God, I think you could try,"
607.8399999999999,614.16," it'll keep track of your temps. I try like 80 times to make a single, to navigate a single little"
614.16,617.92, jump on it. And you get to the point where you know you become frustrated instead of even thinking
617.92,623.28," anymore, you're just like going at it full speed and to see what happens. Maybe you could brute force"
623.28,629.28," it and just get you through. And it's a really good game, well, it's a, it's not a good game"
629.28,632.0," for, but if it's a kind of game, if you're going to play it, I believe you should play it in"
632.0,636.08, ventrilo when you're talking to other people because it's like the fact it's something to
636.08,639.52," do in the background. You know, I don't think it should command like the entirety of your attention."
639.52,643.52," It's like when you're on the phone with someone and you got a pen or if you're doing like right now,"
643.52,647.44," you're playing with chords and stuff. But like it's, if you're doing on on your phone, but"
647.44,651.52," controlling. You should play it while you're listening, you have to be ready. Yeah. Yeah. I think that"
651.52,656.72, will be perfect. Load it up right now. I'll give you a minute. So this game sounds like a
656.72,663.36, site bike with hardener. It's not like a site bike at all. But it is sort of in that like it is.
663.36,669.0400000000001, Go like a bike ramp. Did have a really rude inventory kind of a momentum thing going on. And this
669.0400000000001,674.5600000000001, game is all about like what you're doing with your momentum and with your springs and your bike
674.5600000000001,681.36," and stuff. And like I found it, you were talking about using the keys after, after the first few"
681.36,686.64," levels, I plugged in my Xbox controller and found it to be easier that really."
686.72,692.56," Yeah. Yeah. Then try the keys. But it seemed really vintage. Then like a lot of times,"
692.56,699.1999999999999," just like tap tap can. I mean, and but like the analog stick is nice enough for that. And so"
699.1999999999999,704.4," something about it, just I don't know. Like I maybe it's just because I'm still such a console gamer,"
704.4,710.08, but I found it to be just more intuitive than using my right hand on the on the arrow keys.
710.1600000000001,712.0," Oh, you didn't use WST."
717.0400000000001,722.8000000000001," You are a console gamer. The other if not for the fact that it throws the physics angle on it,"
722.8000000000001,727.6," and it's both. And it's sometimes it's fun. Like when you crash, your guy becomes like just"
727.6,736.24," just epileptic mess of, yeah, you know, twitching and the bike goes flying across the the warehouse"
736.24,740.5600000000001," citron, which I meant to say, like so we're playing. It's not going to be funny. Now I'm repeating it,"
740.5600000000001,744.8," but as we're, you know, the reason to play in the vending is as we're all doing it in screaming, like,"
744.8,750.16," fuck, our shut up. Oh, I did it. And it all sounded like fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck yeah, fuck."
752.16,755.92, I just pointed out that the whole thing set in the same warehouse that one of the people who
755.92,760.08, is invented with me were where his mom filled all of her porno's.
760.4000000000001,766.08," Oh, because the whole thing is in the warehouse. But so it weren't for the physics. I can almost"
766.08,771.12, abstract the game and say it's not to me like excited bike because it almost could be anything.
771.12,777.12," It's really just this, it's really a puzzle game. And it has to me so much in common with like when"
777.12,780.96," you go to those novelty shops in the mall, they'll sell games and like expensive pool tables,"
780.96,785.76, but then they'll also have like a guardian knot that you could buy basically spend the rest of
785.76,791.28," your month trying to untie like it's supposed to be fun or like a peg board, you know, a ball"
791.28,796.08, onto the on a maze board or something like that or all those puzzles where you know if you take
796.08,800.88," it apart, you're never going to get it back together. Yeah. Sometimes it approached that and where"
800.88,805.36," you just give up or like, you know, like again, where you just when you get to the point with"
805.36,809.04," Rubik's Cube where you're like, fuck it and you just take it apart and put it back to the back"
809.04,814.24," to kill your game. But there is something about that time to try to do. I mean, I like,"
814.48,818.48, I have a love hate relationship with those kinds of games. It's like that game in plus that I
818.48,824.96," talked about, you know, like where it's just these really brutal games that that expect a kind of"
824.96,832.24," precision from you and in order to get it, you just have to try again and again and again and"
832.24,838.5600000000001," perfect your technique and there's nothing that you're ever going to fucking do with that technique,"
838.5600000000001,842.64," but play this video. Right. It's not like you're learning anything helpful, but something about"
842.72,848.96," the process is satisfying to me, even though it's a totally pointless. Yeah. Now, I have this game"
848.96,855.12," got to the point where I literally did have to uninstall it. I have a question. Like, it sounds like"
855.12,859.76," it's evil, but how evil is it? Does it like if you do succeed? Does it say good job, but you only"
859.76,863.52," got a silver medal because you could have done that in like six less moves or something. Well,"
863.52,870.24, we're back. You see your performance in the context of everyone else's. So you get to find out that
870.24,875.76," you after spending, you know, 40 minutes going through a single level that had you never"
875.76,879.76," fucked up, would've taken you like two minutes? Right. Because when you wish to do it, you're never"
879.76,885.04," fine. Yeah. Yeah. 7,000, 100 hits. Wow. So it's pretty, it's pretty bad. Because when you"
885.04,888.96," mention those like little peckboard puzzles or whatever, like yeah, you can solve it, but then"
888.96,894.72, all of the always print on it. You can solve this in a 11 move. Yeah. It's like try a shit. Yeah.
894.8000000000001,900.4," There's something good in that and that you can, you can play other people's ghost runs as you're"
900.4,904.32," going. And I was trying to get us to do that. Like, Rory and I, we're all in the same thing. And it"
904.32,909.44, became this race of like who could get through these things faster. And we'd always get stuck on the exact
909.44,914.5600000000001," same parts, you know, where he like, I'm still there, I'm still there. So it's like, I did it and"
914.5600000000001,920.72," I'm like, how? Fuck you. I know, fuck you. I'm on the next level. Yeah. Just do that. But yeah,"
920.72,925.6800000000001," those can get for me to require the, the competitor, the friend competitor, even like,"
925.6800000000001,929.28, Pac-Man Championship edition. Yeah. The only thing that kept me going was knowing I wasn't
929.28,933.44," number one on my friend leader board. I'm like, oh shit, he just beat me. So I got to play it and"
933.44,937.6800000000001, obsessed over it again. Yeah. Until like top that score. And then you have like an imaginary
937.6800000000001,943.28, rivalry. Yeah. Like beating Greg Ford's score. And he was my highest player on the Pac-Man.
943.28,947.44," Right. Then you, then you, I wanted it like, sin him to know it'd be in like, check the scoreboard"
947.5200000000001,951.7600000000001," bitch. But I don't think. Like, it's the, then you feel like you're done. Yeah. It's totally"
951.7600000000001,955.84," arbitrary because like, yeah, it's great for the score. I realize it might make sure I'm still at the"
955.84,960.0, top. Yeah. I don't know. I think you should try them because when you say it's an excellent game for
960.0,965.5200000000001," that. Oh, yeah. Sort of mentality. Yeah. Sure. And I think it is a fun game. I think what it needs."
965.5200000000001,970.4000000000001," And I think that there, that these exist, can you make a, can you make your own levels and can't"
970.4000000000001,975.6," you get user-created levels in that game? That I'm not sure of that makes. Because I would, I know you"
975.6800000000001,983.28," can, there are way too many like that they give you like 10, 12 levels that are of the difficulty"
983.28,988.88, that it's like challenging and interesting and satisfying. But then it goes immediately in. So it's
988.88,995.76," just nuclear Armageddon. And this is the thing. The people who made it, are they such savants"
995.76,1001.76," that it's beyond their comprehension that, that other people are going to get so frustrated with this."
1001.76,1006.24," That again, when I asked you about it in email, like, hey, someone else played this week,"
1006.24,1010.56, you talk about it. You made this comment about it. It's like kicking yourself on the balls.
1010.56,1015.28, But I didn't want to say anything. It's like doing it to kick yourself in the balls. Yeah.
1015.28,1020.3199999999999," Yeah. And when you shut it off, though, there's no like, you know, when you watch a movie or"
1020.3199999999999,1024.72," something and you kind of, or when you finish a book, you close the book, you have that sense of"
1024.72,1029.6," satisfaction. You walk out of the theater. Like this, you turn it off in a rage. And I'd say,"
1029.6799999999998,1034.32," most of the time, you contemplate on installing it, which is like a final violence you can do that never"
1034.32,1038.48," happens. You're like, oh, I don't finish reading the comment book and rip it in half. When you're"
1038.48,1044.8," done doing it. But so this game, temptation is always there to like not only close it, but to get it off"
1044.8,1049.9199999999998," to remove all traces of it. I love that about steam though because you can do that in a, you know,"
1049.9199999999998,1054.1599999999999," yeah, it's not really. You can always take it back, you know, but you can't."
1054.16,1062.0, To lead the lead local content. I saw a video on YouTube of a dude who sent these comics that
1062.0,1068.72," you didn't like back to DC. Thank you, showed me that. Like this one sucks like stuffing it in"
1068.72,1072.3200000000002, the box. Stay where it's like a letter and everything. That's cool. It's like the
1072.3200000000002,1078.24, anniversary of the discount tire commercial where the lady like throws the tire through the window.
1078.24,1085.52," Thank you, Stam and Connick's bag. He throws he shuts him in like their mail slot."
1085.52,1089.6," Yeah, make sure he bangs it if he doesn't know he's a great. But I think I think you can make"
1089.6,1096.16," levels in that game because I think I might be wrong about that. If you can't, then they definitely"
1096.16,1100.8, need to let you. That's a feature I just never use because no one ever seems to have the right
1101.52,1106.4," system for finding and sorting and filtering those things out. Yeah. They just need, if they're"
1106.4,1109.68," going to do that, they need like a really well, they should just have leaderboard string like"
1109.68,1115.92, most popular down like something like that. So I don't want to make levels. I just want to play
1115.92,1120.88," to feature I never use. Like if people, yeah, I mean, if like if you have some sort of quality"
1120.88,1124.5600000000002," filter, I guess this is kind of a slacken because this is one of the things that we could do,"
1124.5600000000002,1129.0400000000002," you know, I mean, we could like put together or talk about. And I think what some of them"
1129.0400000000002,1135.0400000000002, should definitely do is like you're saying make them so easy that the fun is is in just a continuous
1135.12,1141.36," run under insane conditions where you're never like, oh my God, how do I do this? Where you"
1141.36,1146.0, stop them stare at the screen and think how do I get from here to hit it? It kind of reminds me
1146.0,1150.6399999999999, of another thing. It's like the tradition of the concussion maps and team fortress classic.
1150.6399999999999,1155.76, They're mods where you basically just took and made them for medics and scout to both had concussion
1155.76,1161.04, grenades and find ways for them to go through the most insane platforming circumstances that people
1161.12,1166.0," could conceive of. But I don't when you're thinking like okay, you throw a grenade down and you just jump"
1166.0,1172.3999999999999, up to a platform like they got so far beyond what what anyone could imagine that that has that's not
1172.3999999999999,1176.72, familiar with that asian actually played the things that it kind of reminds me of a game for that kind of
1176.72,1182.48," person. But eight dollars again, I think that it's not it's something that it's worth trying and seeing"
1182.48,1188.72," if that's the kind of if it's the game for you, you know, yeah, I mean, because because yeah, every minute"
1188.72,1192.88," when I came in, I was like this gave you that was thinking like this is this guy be the"
1192.88,1199.44," worst shit I ever played. Ten minutes later, I'm like I kind of like this. It's all based on that"
1199.44,1205.04," match the kiss that the fourth of I did it. I didn't do it. Yeah, and then Eli Porter again at the end"
1205.04,1212.08, of the level. The best night. I did it. Now I love the game a lot better if that's what happened when
1212.08,1217.84," you finish the when you finish the level if you like Porter. It needs more. It does give you fireworks,"
1217.84,1224.1599999999999," but it needs more like pego like you it needs oh to joy. Yeah, really big fan for like pego's like tell"
1224.1599999999999,1232.6399999999999," you you work for the opposite because it's really I mean, yeah, they're really difficult levels."
1232.6399999999999,1237.6799999999998," But if you fuck around long enough, you're going to get it. It's an act like when you do that you've"
1237.6799999999998,1243.1999999999998," attained like fucking enlightenment. That's something like that. The highest level. You man,"
1243.2,1248.72," if that is brilliant game. Yeah, but I can get down with that. Like again, that rewards you more than"
1248.72,1252.56, you deserve. It's like flipping a coin and then getting that for hitting tails or something.
1252.56,1257.44," I was like yeah, like they so when it needs a pego mod, where it throws up like full bright"
1257.44,1265.04," starships. No bell awards and like, okay, stuff on the screen in addition to the fireworks."
1267.04,1272.32, So you're granted access to heaven. What's one of the game that tells me that I'm a really good
1272.3999999999999,1277.9199999999998," person and I'm smart and good looking people like you. Like an affidination game. You know,"
1277.9199999999998,1281.9199999999998, like you just you get a headshot and then like people to start calling out of the woodworks to
1281.9199999999998,1288.1599999999999, congratulate you and and like tell you stories about how they knew that that you were going to be great.
1288.72,1292.32," Think of their games like that, right? I mean, their half-life like that half, you know,"
1292.32,1296.8799999999999," like half life two, you're going around every time you run into someone from the resistance. They're like,"
1296.96,1302.64," holy crap, are you Gordon Freeman? Yeah, you know, it's like totally ridiculous."
1302.64,1306.5600000000002," Hey, let's try to do that to some extent, you know, with like, yeah, that's domestic heat."
1307.5200000000002,1312.4," But I mean, they're I think they're getting a lot more literally do it in that like every little"
1312.4,1317.68," thing you do. They want you to know that, you know, yeah. Well, I mean, that's sort of what"
1317.68,1322.5600000000002," satisfying actually is about is just, you know, it's like the God of War thing. Like you don't"
1322.6399999999999,1328.08, have to make it like an ninja guide and precise as long as you make it seem like by hitting these
1328.08,1332.96," buttons, you are literally carrying someone's limbs off. Right. And yeah, giving you the most"
1332.96,1338.6399999999999," satisfying possible feedback. And it also borrowed part of, part of God of War, borrowed the whole"
1338.6399999999999,1344.08," like evolution or de-evolution of combos and games too, you know, or you stepped to work for it."
1344.08,1348.24," Then you got to the point where like Killer Instinct was really like, you had to, you had to"
1348.24,1352.32, input the equivalent of like a seven hit combo and Street Fighter or less and you'd somehow get
1352.32,1357.52," a idea. And now that gets to the point where these games, it's like all accounts is all the"
1357.52,1361.9199999999998," combo meters. It's how many times you fucking press the X button, the sense the time you turn the"
1361.9199999999998,1367.12," game on, you know. Yeah. But that's like another way of telling you, hey, you're doing good, man."
1367.12,1371.2, Yeah. You can't forget it. You bought it. Look at that. You just tore that guy apart.
1371.2,1377.4399999999998," Just you're the chief. I did that ninja guide too. Like you could surprisingly, that of all games"
1377.44,1383.1200000000001," where you know, uh, in a gaki, the producer is like, you know, this is a fighting game,"
1383.1200000000001,1387.52," tell the informs, this and stuff. I was able to just mash a guy with the same button,"
1387.52,1391.52," you get 100 and I got an achievement and all this stuff. It's like, wow. Yeah. I mean, like,"
1391.52,1396.16," definitely cry for you would use your solar, or whatever they were called, and I came to unlock"
1396.16,1400.4," basically, you know, level one of the kind of what XXX, then then you went unlock XXXXXX,"
1400.96,1405.76, you even mock XXXXXXXX. Yeah. That sounds almost as bad as dinosaur years.
1406.08,1410.4," Well, I mean, I don't know. People that think that like, uh, the achievements and games should"
1410.4,1415.84," be won through like seriously hardcore play or a little warped. It's like, you're not really doing"
1415.84,1421.52, anything when you beat Ninja Giden to the hardest mode besides ruining your life.
1422.72,1426.56, All right. True. You are not doing anything. Read a fucking book.
1426.56,1429.6," You had to be careful that you don't review like game for anyone, because then all the, the,"
1429.6,1430.72," the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,"
1430.8,1435.3600000000001," review game. See, dude. He's just busy. You know, could handle it. Yeah. Whatever."
1435.3600000000001,1442.48," You're nice to move. I got that. What else are we playing here? Oh, I, I'm boring. I was, I actually went"
1442.48,1448.4," back to GTA 4 and tried to put it down to that. So enough, GTA 4 to talk for a entire lifetime."
1448.4,1453.04," If we don't, I mean, I know Conan's and come up. Yeah. I got Star Clear Sky, which we're free to talk"
1453.04,1458.8," about. Oh, good. And, but it, I mean, I haven't been playing. Sort of, I've been playing."
1458.8799999999999,1463.28," Right. I'm talking about, like, it's like, I'm talking about, like, it's like, I'm talking about, like,"
1463.28,1468.6399999999999," go Indiana Jones. Yeah. Tell us about in the, that's got to be definitely along the lines of, like,"
1468.6399999999999,1473.04," a game that, because all this, oh, that make a Star Wars games are all about, like, way to go."
1473.04,1477.04, That's why. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely nothing. Yeah. That's what that is. Those
1477.04,1482.56," teams are, wake cool. You go in play. So it is, like, the indie is the Indiana Jones game is as cool as this."
1483.28,1485.52, It's like exactly the same. It's yeah.
1486.48,1492.08," It's like though, except you're Indiana Jones and not, not Luke Skywalker. I admire this"
1492.08,1499.36," games for allowing you to progress in them, no matter how impossibly Drunk you are. Like, you"
1499.36,1505.76," cannot be, you can't like, you know, your mind cannot be altered to the point that you would not be"
1505.76,1510.08," able to be Lego Star Wars. Our cake games worked that way, but it just was about how much"
1510.08,1514.08," I'm, I'm, many quarters you had. Yeah. But you could be, you could conceivable be as, as Drunk"
1514.08,1518.96," is, you could, in the Hill stand. That's maybe leaning on the cabinet to maintain."
1518.96,1522.24, You got it. You got it. You could still do it. You guys still go to the right.
1522.24,1526.8799999999999," But you just, you're frigging certainly in you. I guess that's true. Yeah. That was totally a game where"
1526.8799999999999,1532.08," Star Wars were, um, this would have bugged me in any other game, like the force powers you have"
1532.08,1536.0," were you allowed, were you press a button to stack up Lego's in a way that lets you access"
1536.0,1539.6799999999998," a new area? Any other game I would have been like, how come I don't, how come they just don't,"
1539.6799999999998,1543.4399999999998," like, lay the legos out and say, try to stack up something you can climb. This one, they just, like,"
1543.52,1547.76," press X, it builds into a steering wheel. So what, and that was okay for me for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah,"
1547.76,1552.4," because it's freaking Lego Star Wars. There's about Lego Indiana Jones right? How is it, like,"
1552.4,1557.92," utilizing sort of the Lego brand? How is it leveraging the Lego brand? No, how, how is it using"
1557.92,1563.6000000000001," the, how is it using the Lego theme? Because unlike some of the other Lego games that I've looked"
1563.6000000000001,1568.4," at screen, that I've looked at screens for, show you how it forms that. I've looked at screen,"
1568.4,1575.8400000000001, whole world of Lego games. This one I'll see natural environments with Lego components and
1575.8400000000001,1580.24," it and stuff. Like, it's like your plan, Lego's in the grass or something. Right. It's, I mean,"
1580.24,1584.88," like, it's like, Lego Star Wars, like the whole world. I don't say I haven't played Lego Star"
1584.88,1590.16," Wars so, so like, break it down for me, like Robert made me break down the world of Warhammer"
1590.16,1597.52," 40 times. Like, the whole world, it's not, it's not all, it's a Lego world. I mean, there's objects"
1597.6,1602.8," made out of Legos. Like, you know, you, you, you got this hub area that's the university where"
1602.8,1608.16," Indiana Jones teaches. And that? Can you teach a class? You can't, you can go,"
1608.16,1613.68," punch out some people walking around the school. You just do that. But, you know, like, there's a"
1613.68,1618.8799999999999," library, there's bookshows, there's normal look and bookshows. So, yeah, so people in the"
1618.8799999999999,1624.4," man made artifacts are, I mean, there's some Lego like plant and stuff laying around, but it's mainly"
1624.48,1629.3600000000001," just the character. The characters are done in the Lego style, right? I mean,"
1629.3600000000001,1633.92," that's really, in those games. In those games, they're made of Legos matter in this, though."
1633.92,1639.68," I mean, in the way that you're, you're talking about composing things from the Legos and the"
1639.68,1643.68," Empire. Which don't do Star Wars. Yeah. You, I mean, the game doesn't for you. Oh, I see."
1643.68,1648.16," I mean, there's, it does seem like you see little stuff in the cutscenes, but like,"
1649.6000000000001,1654.3200000000002," you know, in the scene and Raiders of the Lost Ark where the big German mechanic"
1654.32,1663.36," gets his face, whatever happens to it with the propeller. There's a scene like, there's a cutscene"
1663.36,1667.36, like that. It shows like that happening and then you'll see like his Lego body running around and
1667.36,1671.2, then his head bouncing around and depending on the way. You can show extreme violence without
1671.2,1675.2, actually having a Lego. Nothing like a good decapitation joke with Legos.
1675.2,1682.32," Yeah. So, they have, you know, like the Boulder rolling down the tempo, but the"
1682.3999999999999,1687.2, Boulder's made out of Legos. They do. Exactly. I've seen that screen up. That is the first thing
1687.2,1693.12," they came to mind. Yeah. The Boulder's made out of Legos. Yeah. So, is it like, I mean, it's all"
1693.12,1698.8," us. I'm kind of disappointed. Like, if it's not really using the Lego stuff on a on a structural"
1698.8,1703.4399999999998," or game play level, I mean, if it's using them, you know, for gags and for the visual element,"
1703.4399999999998,1709.4399999999998," what kind of game is it? Is it, is it just your typical, you know, action platformer type thing where"
1709.52,1716.96, you go through the environment? It is. A lot of the challenge lies in sort of the puzzles.
1716.96,1722.4," You know, figuring out how to open the door to this next area. Yeah. Which involves stacking"
1722.4,1727.68," up Legos, like you said, same thing except you're not using the force. How are you stacking them"
1727.68,1735.1200000000001," just? Just a manual. I mean, there was a thing about, I mean, like the Star Wars game wasn't"
1735.1999999999998,1740.3999999999999, so much like Legos and forms what you did with it. It was that the Legos created the
1740.3999999999999,1746.8, lightness to it. Yeah. It was like a very non-serious world. Yeah. There were no consequences. It's
1746.8,1751.6799999999998, it's not. Yeah. It's just sort of. It could be to big playground. Yeah. There was a lot of
1751.6799999999998,1755.9199999999998, elasticity like there I think. It's wildish. Yeah. Thanks for turning into other things just because
1755.9199999999998,1760.3999999999999," they could. And it's not like you had necessarily, you were more watching this happen than directly"
1760.4,1767.52, a fact how it happened. But the lies and pigs are made a Lego movie. Maybe it's all about branding.
1767.52,1772.72," They can't afford the license. People don't like it. Dane's the judge. Because net double, the auto"
1772.72,1776.96, cell folks are those ones who have the Lego universe license because that sounds like what they're
1776.96,1781.92," trying to do. They're making an MMO out of Legos, which at first you're like, what? Then"
1782.8000000000002,1787.92, if you think about it and what you're talking about with like what you really can do with Legos
1787.92,1792.64," and that's, you know, build whatever the freak you want. Yeah. That could be really fun."
1792.64,1796.0," I'm fine with like, well, Legos. I can't say that with the Lego brand. Oh, yeah."
1796.0,1801.1200000000001," So what if you take an MMO and it's got like elements of Gary's mod and also, you know,"
1801.1200000000001,1805.52, little big planet because of it because of the way that the Lego stuff works. Then they can get
1805.52,1810.96," the what are the advanced, what are Legos for like for like for honor role students called"
1810.96,1816.48," you get like batteries. Oh, right. You got like why would it about the Lego monster? Yeah. I've"
1816.56,1821.28, been tempted to buy this for because you can build like robots and then that's like its own programming
1821.28,1825.3600000000001," language so you can program your robots AI and all this stuff. Well, it's weird because Lego is"
1825.3600000000001,1830.96," themselves over the years. From what I remember Legos being as a kid, like Lego is now our a lot more"
1830.96,1835.44," about like we give you a blueprint to build this very specific thing. Yeah. Whereas when you're a kid,"
1835.44,1840.56," it's like, here's a bunch of freaking Lego. I don't just build what you want, kid. I never got like,"
1840.56,1845.28," yeah, the box sets they have now. If you go out of toys or us or whatever. I mean, I would specialize"
1845.36,1849.44," components, but the mindstorms thing definitely is not about I mean, they'll give you some things you"
1849.44,1854.24," can build, but it's it's a lot more open and people do build a lot of weird stuff with it. Did the"
1854.24,1859.84, Legos themselves change or people just less like get out than like we were because I know it was
1859.84,1864.8799999999999, the same. I never saw like I never got Legos in a box. Like I got like a bag of Legos sometimes
1864.8799999999999,1870.48," there'd be do flow blocks there and a link a lot. I'm sure you can still get that. I mean, the Lego"
1870.48,1875.04," store or maybe what you make like there's no I mean, go to Lego store and fucking come and"
1875.04,1879.92, this back there's bats of these areas like I need I need a handful of green ones that have two
1879.92,1884.48," connectors. So you just can buy them in bulk Legoelibians, but yeah. And like if you do go to"
1884.48,1889.28, toys or else they don't have the variety kit anymore. And I'm assuming kids don't think kids are
1889.28,1893.6, so creatively deployed maybe they are. That they wouldn't construct their own things out of their
1893.6,1898.1599999999999," multiple Indiana Jones sets that they've been given over various birthdays. I mean, yeah, I just"
1898.1599999999999,1902.32, still have that ability once you have a few of them. I definitely got stuff that was specific when
1902.32,1908.56, I was a kid. I remember I got like a castle place. I got like a castle thing that was very
1908.56,1913.6," specific, but then I would use parts of it to make like spaceships and stuff. Yeah, it didn't work."
1913.6,1917.76," It was like, but it was like it did make cool walls because the castle walls were these"
1917.76,1922.3999999999999," like specific pieces that fit together and had windows. And so this made to make a castle, but you"
1922.3999999999999,1926.96," could go to stuff with it. Yeah, I always made like the most ridiculous looking things, because I just"
1926.96,1933.52, didn't have any care about the aesthetics of like the colors. Yeah. So I was not going to bother to
1933.52,1941.44, like try to match colors up. And so everything I made looked like total junk shop like bright.
1941.44,1946.32," I think she made some beautiful light gray genuishes. Yeah, actually I never had a light bright."
1946.32,1950.32, Really? I wanted more than that. Well that's like how many houses light brights burned down.
1950.32,1956.8, Light bright for you. A younger listeners is basically like a plastic little cabinet with the
1957.44,1962.16, light bulb in the middle. Pretty hot light bulb. And then like a grid you put a black piece of paper
1962.16,1966.24, over that and seal the whole thing up and there's this grid with holes for pegs and you put
1966.24,1970.4, colored pegs in and it punches through the black paper and then illuminates the lighted peg.
1971.1200000000001,1974.8," Yeah, but in most cases it was like, yeah, you're saying you just stick a bunch of sheet in there and"
1974.8,1981.68," I know that was fun. I see a lot of bands can we do it? Yep. All right, like as stage comes up."
1982.48,1988.88," Yeah. Oh, the Lagos Lagos or we're a big part of growing up for me. I always went to the"
1988.88,1993.2, state fair of taxes and went to the Lego competition and looked at the things that people
1993.2,1998.64, made with Lagos and wish that I could like make my own like giant thing. People would make like
1998.64,2003.52, cities or they'd make the Millennium Falcon or something you know before they had the cans of
2003.52,2008.72, price. Yeah. Like giant scenes where you know you had people still do this today but you know where
2008.8,2014.0, it's like a thousand dollars with the Lagos or something you know every every poor kid coming through
2014.0,2019.3600000000001," there's like, oh, I wish I could take that apart Lego win and they've got entire cityscapes and stuff."
2019.3600000000001,2025.44," Yeah, yeah, instructions of Paris and New York. So Ryan and me and anything else on any other thoughts on"
2027.3600000000001,2036.08," it's pretty fun. Pretty fun. Good mindless fun. Yeah, that's how I would character. No context"
2036.56,2042.8, anything. Yes. It's good to have that teach your children. Nothing they don't already know.
2042.8,2048.4, Okay. That's true. So we saw Robert you played some you're still playing stalker right?
2048.4,2054.08," Yeah, sir. I'm sort of held up at the moment. They came by with they being Jesse Game World"
2054.08,2059.12, came by with the stalker clear sky which is kind of like a prequel. Well it is a prequel.
2059.12,2062.08, I don't know why I said kind of. I got to go guys and I'll feel right.
2063.04,2066.72," Well, so yeah, they keep by with the prequel and it's uh"
2068.08,2072.64," first of all, it's just visually arresting. I mean, this is what they showed us. They turn it on and they're like,"
2072.64,2077.2799999999997," before they even explain anything, they just kind of like loaded up, walk around this town,"
2077.7599999999998,2083.2799999999997, speed up the movement of the sun across the sky so that you see the dynamic shadows and stuff and
2083.84,2089.84," win going through. Doesn't make that though. I know. And so you're like, well, you got your way"
2089.92,2093.04," because the first thing I'm talking about is that yes, it looks better than stalker, which I thought was a"
2093.04,2099.6000000000004," pretty good looking and highly atmospheric game. But um, it was kind of a weird demonstration."
2099.6000000000004,2103.6000000000004," It was there's some language barrier there just asking, well, what are you showing us? What are"
2103.6000000000004,2110.32," like the consequences of this? Why are you doing this? Um, one thing that did sort of, I was"
2110.32,2114.4," able to, you know, make sense of immediately when they showed us this, there's this marsh level."
2115.12,2119.12," And of course, inspired by, uh, I think it's the Pripate marsh, it's not to come to you"
2119.12,2124.48," can be used with Pripate out, but there's the large, you know, bunch of, you know, marshy terrain"
2124.96,2129.36, and Ukraine. And it looks like images of that from what I've seen. The interesting thing about
2129.36,2133.2000000000003," is that when you're going to make an environment stalker, let me back up as a first person shooter,"
2134.7200000000003,2142.88," made in from a Kiev studio. And so it's set in the Chernobyl vicinity, the Chernobyl reactor,"
2142.96,2148.88," takes place in this, you know, alternate world where, uh, the reactor didn't just melt down, but"
2148.88,2152.96," it caused all sorts of supernatural stuff. And instead of it ever being, you know, handled in any"
2152.96,2158.1600000000003," way, shape or form, it kind of becomes like a Russian madmax now, lying area. So you're in these"
2158.1600000000003,2162.08," marshes and in the party showing, and it's pretty cool because you most people wouldn't think to make"
2162.08,2169.92," an FPS level in such a, like, absolutely flat environment. Usually you want elevation changes in"
2170.0,2174.64, stuff. And here you have a horizon that's almost perfectly flat. It's only broken up by whatever
2174.64,2179.44," trees and tall grass, you know, a sedgent stuff you see. And as you're going through that, this is"
2179.44,2184.8," interesting because you don't know what's going to come out of the bushes, like immediately in front"
2184.8,2190.32," of you, some mutated board could rush out. You might walk into what they, what are they, they're just"
2190.32,2196.96," anomalies, right? Some sort of, you know, supernatural or, or extra scientific anomaly, where you locate"
2197.04,2201.52," these with various, you know, meters and stuff that you have in the game now. And you, you upgrade them."
2201.52,2205.28," You might have, like, a budget thing that just kind of, like, beeps as you're in the area, you might"
2205.28,2210.56," have, like, the equivalent of a, the trick-out GPS that tells you almost precisely where it's at,"
2210.56,2215.28," what its magnitude is, what, what the nature of the anomaly is, or you just kind of, like, go around"
2215.28,2220.48," raw dog with a handful of, like, bolts and screws and thrown around. And when they blow up or get sucked"
2220.48,2224.8," up into a vortex, you know, this is a dangerous area. So as you was going through here, I was like,"
2224.8,2229.04, this is interesting. How is this going to work? It was immediately cool because I had never seen
2230.4,2234.6400000000003," this sort of environment in a game. But then when he climbs up into this tower, it's like,"
2234.6400000000003,2239.52," oh, it's really like a sort of like a, a hedger-o-made maze or something, you know, like a"
2239.52,2244.48," labrant in the castle where it's not until you, you have some ability to get up above where you're"
2244.48,2247.76," at, and you look at the lay in the land, and it's just massive, and you're able to say, ah,"
2248.6400000000003,2252.8," this is, this is basically the path I need to take, and you have to mentally map what you're"
2252.88,2256.48," going to do to get out of this place. There's like a little bit of a board crossing,"
2256.48,2262.7200000000003," some maybe it's, you know, like a quick sand type area here, something like, and then, and then"
2262.7200000000003,2268.4," climb back down and say, now I got to translate that view I just had into my experience of going"
2268.4,2272.8," through the stick grass with this, like really moving her eyes and stuff. That's pretty cool."
2272.8,2277.52," So, wait, I mean, is there any indication when you're playing that, like, you were the player,"
2277.52,2281.76," should really look down there, because I think most people would be inclined upon climbing a tower"
2281.84,2286.8," and saying, if you would not to like take it at the, take it at the value of, like, a map,"
2286.8,2291.0400000000004," they would kind of take it as, like, look how cool this looks. Yeah, they did that. This is why I'm"
2291.0400000000004,2296.0800000000004," saying, like, piecing it out, because it wasn't like the, the demonstrator was telling us any of this."
2296.0800000000004,2301.28," He was like, look, I'm walking through a marsh. He should be noticing their reflections in the water,"
2301.28,2306.7200000000003," and the way that the shadows are dynamically moving is the sun's, you know, the way the reads"
2307.68,2311.9199999999996," right. And it was like, but it totally made sense just looking through it and it just communicated"
2311.9199999999996,2316.0," that to me, just through the design of it, right? I mean, if you're in a flat area in real life,"
2316.0,2319.8399999999997," and you see one opportunity, well, you're going to climb a tree. If you see a tree, you're going to"
2319.8399999999997,2324.72," climb the tree and see what you can see, you know? I mean, and the way that it was set up, and of course,"
2324.72,2328.3199999999997," it encouraged you to go up to it just by even being there, right? If you're in a flat environment in a"
2328.3199999999997,2332.48," video game, and there's one tower, right? What are the odds that you're not going to go up into that"
2333.12,2337.2," tower? And even if you're just generally not interested, you've been conditioned through that"
2337.2,2342.72," tower. Here's a playing FPS suspect that maybe there's a sniper rifle up there, maybe there's"
2342.72,2346.4," some ammo, maybe there's a quest item or something. So you're going to go up there."
2346.4,2352.4," Yeah, that's one of the things that I that I've sort of wanted to see, like, that I would like to see"
2352.4,2358.64, in an evolution of stalker is their level designed to communicate a little bit more of what they
2358.64,2366.3199999999997," have in mind to get a little bit of Zelda about it. Like, just to have some, I mean, sometimes"
2366.3199999999997,2369.52," you wanted to go, do you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
2369.52,2377.3599999999997," I just want there to be some intuitive design to let you know what you, what you can do, what you"
2377.3599999999997,2381.68," should do, that sort of thing, not like to beat you over the head with it. Right, as it is, like,"
2381.68,2385.7599999999998," a lot of times, I'll be maybe playing the, yeah, a lot of times playing the original stalker."
2385.76,2391.0400000000004," It's almost like you really are just roaming around the Chernobyl explosions zone, which is cool."
2391.0400000000004,2397.76," But you do know if you look in your PDA and stuff, you'll get indications of where you ought to be"
2397.76,2402.7200000000003," headed. Yeah. But you just never have that, the confidence. Maybe that's what you know,"
2402.7200000000003,2406.5600000000004," you're missing is that like, like, in, you know, on half life, if you head in a direction,"
2407.28,2411.0400000000004," you're reasonably certain that you're going the right way, just by the fact that you can go"
2411.04,2415.6," there. Yeah. So it's like, I mean, I don't know. It's hard for me. I don't want to defend"
2415.6,2420.48," Starter too much, but it's like, it's what makes it, what it is for me. It's like, I can just,"
2420.48,2425.68," so many other games that are really clear about everything. But I don't know, you have to be clear."
2425.68,2432.64, I just think that there's something to be said for like a design that isn't so incredibly vague.
2432.64,2439.04," I mean, I enjoy vagueness and mystery, but I think that if they were going to go in any direction,"
2439.04,2445.2," it would be to create, to create levels that make a little bit more sense. Right."
2445.2,2450.24," Just a little bit more sense. I think they, you know, all like, was telling us that they did get"
2450.24,2455.44," prior to the THQ pressured them to make ultimately a more accessible game. Oh, yeah."
2455.44,2460.0," They published Starter, but that they fought like every step of the way. And guessing that they were"
2460.0,2465.68," sort of empowered in that fight by the fact that they were working for such a for such low wages,"
2466.64,2470.24," when Starter was a profitable game, even though it wasn't the best selling game."
2470.24,2477.52," Yeah. Um, well, it's the best. Yeah. They're really a really bizarre and interesting game."
2477.52,2482.3199999999997," I mean, I like that you could never ever see coming out of a studio, like practically anywhere else."
2482.3199999999997,2486.64," Yeah. And when he, Sean, you were there, right? And he was like, this is, I was kind of like,"
2486.64,2492.0," this is for us. Like this, I'm making, we make this game for Ukrainians. Like we make this game"
2492.0,2496.56, for the guy down the street that gets computer parts from God knows where and puts them together
2496.56,2499.92," and plays this game. Like he flat out, so he's like, that's who this game is for."
2499.92,2504.96," I've always been drawn to the, that kind of, uh, impenetrable game where like they don't really tell you what"
2504.96,2509.76," the game is because, uh, even, I think for the PlayStation was called Scentient, as I remember"
2509.76,2514.56," Scentient, probably not. Yeah. It's basically like you are in a space station."
2515.52,2518.56, Something is happening. And then they just kind of give you free run of the space station.
2518.56,2521.84," And there's just people wandering around doing their work, you know, just like hammering"
2521.92,2526.56," on, you know, a pipe because they're repairing it. And they may, you can talk to them and maybe"
2526.56,2529.6800000000003, they're just hammering on a pipe or maybe they got something to tell you. Yeah. And so it's just
2529.6800000000003,2534.8," this like, the game is figuring out the game in a lot of ways. Yeah. I've always been drawn to that."
2534.8,2539.36, Even though it ultimately usually ends up frustrating and networking out like I hope because like
2539.36,2544.48," when you start to see like the game design that's really there, you're just like, oh, all this stuff is just"
2544.48,2550.6400000000003," filler. To me, it's, right? To me, it's not so much like ease of access or use or anything or"
2550.72,2560.16," making it like, you know, easier for non-serious gamers to get into as much as I just find games that"
2560.16,2565.92," are able to convey something to you almost subconsciously to be more compelling or to be like,"
2565.92,2570.72," how I fundamentally interesting. Like you can vase that to me, like I never got lost in there."
2570.72,2573.92," I think that could be part of the different I never got lost and I never hit a point where I was like,"
2573.92,2578.3199999999997," God, I need a strategy guide. I need to ask someone for help. Like there's never anything that"
2579.1200000000003,2585.36," even like retarded my progress through the game. Yeah. I never necessarily got lost, but I also"
2585.6800000000003,2592.0," didn't stumble on to lots of really interesting things in the vast white open spaces, which is"
2592.0,2596.0," I know we've talked about this before. Yeah, I know that's something. Something that is actually kind of"
2596.0,2602.1600000000003, cool about the game is that you're walking around and there will be this farmhouse or like a warehouse or
2602.1600000000003,2607.1200000000003," something. It's all, it's, you know, obviously they spend a lot of time working on it and art, you know,"
2607.2,2613.04," it's got all kinds of stuff going on, but nothing like no fire fight, nothing that you would really"
2613.04,2616.48, need to pick right for the game. That's sort of interesting and that sort of shadow the
2616.48,2624.08, class this way where it's like the vast empty world that gives you a mood. Yeah. But I think that
2624.08,2629.68, that's a fair enough argument and it leads me back to what they showed me with clear skies that
2630.48,2636.48," so they they definitely didn't indicate that they're interested in making, you know, the levels"
2636.56,2641.52," any more accessible than they think they might have already had been, but for populating that"
2641.52,2647.04," world with interesting activity, that seems to be the primary, you know, thrust here. And that's to take"
2647.28,2652.32," their AI system, which they call AI life. And the reason they think it's unique enough to"
2652.32,2657.52," deserve its own name rather than just AI is that, you know, I mean, this notion that"
2657.52,2662.8," it's all procedural, these groups go around and they might fight because they run into each other"
2662.88,2667.28, and the this AI borers running around and it's got some rudimentary purpose to it. They'll
2667.28,2672.6400000000003," give it like an ecological range, you know, and say it eats here or something like that. And you"
2672.6400000000003,2678.2400000000002," can now look on your map and you'll see, you know, with flashing dots that there are these various"
2678.2400000000002,2682.0800000000004," groups and these various, you know, alliances that are that are in parts of the world and you"
2682.0800000000004,2685.52, might see that they're actually fighting when you see like there's orange dots and there's green
2685.52,2691.6800000000003," dots together. If you did go into that area, you will see the AI having a battle, you know,"
2691.7599999999998,2695.7599999999998," and maybe you happen to be affiliated with the green, you can also be affiliated with the orange,"
2695.7599999999998,2699.6," you can then join in that way or if you're somewhere, then they might just roll through with you."
2700.16,2705.2," When they demonstrated it, first was skeptical because it looked so good, this battle that they showed"
2705.2,2711.2," me and it was as seamless as most scripted scenarios would be in that a group of guys come in,"
2711.2,2716.7999999999997," they encounter a rival gang, they immediately start taking covers. There's like rocks in the grass"
2716.7999999999997,2720.7999999999997," and they like they immediately like drop down behind them and they're leaning on the rocks,"
2720.88,2725.2000000000003," throwing grenades up over their shoulders, peeking around them and then getting up and so it's like,"
2725.2000000000003,2729.6800000000003," no way, this is scripted, right? You enter this area, you come across a trip wire, then these guys"
2729.6800000000003,2734.32," come out and go to these spots, the enemy, they perform the stage show for you. He insisted that it"
2734.32,2738.5600000000004," wasn't that it was more like, you know, they get into a fight and they're also trained to take cover"
2738.5600000000004,2744.48, and the environment is marked with this is a place for suitable cover. If you're AI and you're in this area
2744.48,2750.2400000000002," and you're fighting, go here, go there. I don't know yet, I have to, I mean, I just take"
2750.24,2756.08," word on it, but it looked really cool and it seemed to, it has the potential to maybe fix a lot of"
2756.08,2760.08," that stuff or if they're like dude, this area is just empty and a player's coming here."
2760.08,2764.56, Let's bullshit it and have something happen. Let's have like a bunch of fucking wild dogs or the
2764.56,2768.56," possibility of something happening. Yeah, it doesn't necessarily have to happen in a scripted way,"
2768.56,2773.3599999999997," but all that unscripted stuff, I mean, the A life, that was all part of the original game and"
2773.3599999999997,2777.8399999999997, part of the reason that they said that it took them so long to make was that they were so focused on
2777.92,2782.2400000000002, these weird simulation aspects of the game that most people probably aren't even really
2782.2400000000002,2785.92," going to, or didn't appreciate in the first one, maybe they'll appreciate more in the second one."
2785.92,2792.96," Yeah, there was a lot, I think a lot of work on that game done in sort of creating a realistic world"
2793.92,2800.08, which is just not not what you would imagine when someone decides they want to make a semi-sci-fi
2800.08,2805.28," game about the Chernobyl exclusion zone, but it's really pretty behavior and appearance."
2805.28,2810.7200000000003, That's why I mean the stuff about the graphics do matter. I mean they were showing this DX10
2810.7200000000003,2816.7200000000003," feature where, you know, like if there's cold or warm air or something, you could see it displacing"
2816.7200000000003,2821.84," as it's passing over objects and stuff and it was like, oh man, so that's DX10 only that sucks"
2821.84,2826.0," because that basically means that it can never be nothing anything more than I can to you, right?"
2826.0,2829.6000000000004," I mean, you can't make it in a real game play because you can never be certain that more than"
2829.68,2834.24," time you percentage of your player base is going to have the capacity to use it, but if they could,"
2834.24,2839.68," then it's like, wow, you go into an environment and you have to track these invisible things just"
2839.68,2844.72," by watching air movements and stuff, noting kind of like just ghost hunting shit like on the"
2844.72,2850.16," sci-fi channel when they break it down with like night vision cameras. Oh, yeah, but yeah, I mean there's"
2850.16,2854.16," like this enormous, you just said on the next project to just doing it. I think for the ALI that"
2854.16,2857.7599999999998," there, they were like, they were expressing that they were disappointed with stalker with the weight."
2858.2400000000002,2861.0400000000004," Not that they're disappointed with it, but that they wanted more from it, you know,"
2861.0400000000004,2865.84," yeah, and that this is their opportunity with this game to go back and like really try to deliver"
2865.84,2870.8," on the whole like multiple factions, what happens when you join this one or that one,"
2870.8,2877.2000000000003, and when they fight one another and they work in the environment and stuff. So I thought that
2877.2000000000003,2881.76," looks pretty cool. I want to see more of it. It's coming out the summer. I mean, that's the"
2881.76,2886.4," surprise thing that is coming out summer quickly. Wow. Yeah, okay. Like, yeah, maybe it was"
2886.4,2890.2400000000002," late. Well, late summer, you know, I'll just September. Yeah. It's interesting because the first"
2890.2400000000002,2895.28," stalker took him into years. Right. Several. Yeah. And that went, and underwent different revisions."
2895.28,2900.08, And stuff. I mean originally it was a game with vehicles as well. And what they kind of decided now
2900.08,2904.56," was that well, I mean, people actually modded those back in. They found the code and stalker"
2904.56,2907.6800000000003," and like, hey, let's put the trucks and stuff back in. But the tradeoff they have is like,"
2908.32,2912.4," you know, the game of this magnitude, the way that's the world of stalker and clear sky as well is"
2912.4,2916.8," organized is that if you imagine a map and you cut it up into a pizza slice or something, it"
2916.8,2921.36," doesn't actually look like the shape of a pizza, but it has those divisions. And you can go anywhere"
2921.36,2925.92," you want in one slice, but then when you cross the boundary into another slice, you load into"
2925.92,2929.92," this other area. But then they're all connected. And you don't like, if you want to go, you"
2929.92,2933.2000000000003," don't have to go clockwise around the pizza to get the other slices, you can cross over in any"
2933.2000000000003,2937.2000000000003," direction you want to get to these. So the world is like that, but you have these loading things."
2937.2000000000003,2942.1600000000003, And what that means is that they do that for one because they want that high degree of fidelity
2942.24,2945.52," in each environment. If you're going to render the whole world like a Bolivian style or something,"
2945.52,2950.48," you have to have some tradeoffs. And when you introduce a vehicle, it means traveling really quickly"
2950.48,2955.6," across these and it means hitting those load points like in half life too, you know, where it's"
2955.6,2959.7599999999998," like, you see a tunnel coming, that's your queue that you're getting coffee, go get it, yeah,"
2959.7599999999998,2962.48," it's just a shrink, you know. Yeah, so they've worried that."
2962.48,2968.0," Did it? I mean, you probably wouldn't have been shown this, but I was wondering, like, how"
2968.08,2973.44," will this pizza slice is match up because one of the things in and it's not like, is that"
2973.44,2979.52," this is meba. Yeah, like, one of the things in stalkers that were a map of countries. Yeah,"
2979.52,2984.0," yeah, yeah. But like while those, while those countries, like, put up against each other and you can"
2984.0,2989.04," go between them, it's funny, like, how you will cross that line of loading and look back and"
2989.04,2993.28," it sort of, like, doesn't really match in the game. Do you know what an environment does? Yeah,"
2993.28,2999.0400000000004," like, like, they don't, they don't match up in perfect seams. Like, you'll be crossing, like, close to a"
2999.0400000000004,3005.76," gate and then it'll cut into a, into a load screen and then you look back on the other side and"
3005.76,3010.88," you don't see the gate, you're like on some hills. And so there's some, like, it's like a rudimentary"
3010.88,3016.8," like someplace is the exit to the house. So they are one, the way they're, they're all the way. Yeah,"
3016.8,3021.28," like towards the stadium, if you've been there, stadiums are definitely jump. No, I don't"
3021.36,3026.0800000000004, think I've been there and I'm just outside Pripyat. Yeah. I think that's another one too when you
3026.0800000000004,3030.96," get into the city. Yeah. I mean, it's a big deal. But I mean, a lot of games will put up just enough"
3030.96,3034.96," of what it would used to be there to make it look, yeah, right? It's like, yeah, there was that"
3034.96,3040.0," tree there and maybe that cave entrance, but it didn't quite look like that. Yeah, I feel like stockers"
3040.0,3045.1200000000003," one of those games that were like, you just, you like it so much that like all the little"
3046.08,3052.48," sort of sort of almost low file like low budget, even though even if it's not low budget, but"
3052.48,3058.48," like sort of homemade feeling aspects of the game, only enhance your love of it, you know,"
3058.48,3064.24, like when you when you go to the inventory screen and it like jumps at you from like 1996. Yeah.
3064.24,3069.7599999999998," And there's like this really lame looking dude, there he's supposed to be you and and all the"
3069.84,3075.84," little graphics of the things are pretty like, yeah, but it's one of those games that like it's"
3075.84,3081.28," the the more I sit on it, the more I kind of like it and appreciate it for what it is, you know,"
3081.28,3085.6000000000004," yeah, and it's like and the less relevant all that little stuff comes back. So it's like if if I was talking"
3085.6000000000004,3089.6800000000003," to someone who's just playing it and they're like, yeah, but the fucking inventory's mess or like this"
3089.6800000000003,3093.84," and this and like you get to the point where you're like where it's closer to criticism, you're like,"
3093.84,3097.5200000000004," well, that doesn't matter. Like this is like if I was a writer of you about it, I'm not going to"
3097.52,3102.56," talk about that shit, right? You know, yeah. So we have only had 20 minutes left. Let's move on to um,"
3102.56,3106.8," because we've read a few other games, but you know, this is a good segue because you were talking about"
3106.8,3115.36," earlier listening to foreign music. Oh, that is. Yeah. I mean, okay, let's hit this up real quick and"
3115.36,3119.28, then go to Conan because I feel that way about this game that there's something about it's foreign
3119.28,3123.36," is that it makes you appreciate it. No, that's perfect. Yeah, but because I kind of been wanting to"
3123.44,3128.0," bring this up for a while, because now it's been like a month when I started listening to like some"
3128.0,3134.08," French rap, some French hip-hop and it's like to the point where like it's instead of just"
3134.08,3138.0," digging around with it for like a couple of listens in a week, it's like, that's pretty much all"
3138.0,3144.8," I've been listening to for a month. It's like and the the thing about it is that like this game,"
3144.8,3151.6800000000003," yes, sometimes things from other places can can help inform you about how you read, you know,"
3151.7599999999998,3155.3599999999997," the things that you in your own language that come from your own culture and stuff. So for me,"
3155.3599999999997,3159.44," like listening to it, I want to recommend, I'll play a quick, quick snippet of it, but Kenny Arkinah"
3160.24,3166.72," is like an Argentinian who then, you know, immigrated to France and I think her stuff's fantastic."
3167.7599999999998,3173.3599999999997," It's just listening to it. You can even, I, the other, here's another important thing. I, I had,"
3173.3599999999997,3179.68," you know, in high school and college, I took some French courses, not enough to ever become fluent,"
3179.7599999999998,3185.04," but enough so that like maybe every three out of ten words or something, I understand."
3185.04,3189.68," And I find that that's a food item. Right, and it's a food. All I have is just like,"
3189.68,3197.44," it just craves and, like, cafe, but, but hearing enough of that is like, it's not entirely strange"
3197.44,3203.04," to me. And also because it's heavily influenced by, you know, American, American hip-hop,"
3203.04,3208.64," but it's now I'm listening to it and stuff like, oh, like, just, just sound, just sounds fantastic."
3208.64,3212.56," I mean, like, the flow, yeah, you got the flow, man. And it's written about the flow."
3212.56,3218.24," But that's up from the Bob Robb video. YouTube at Bob Robb, UBB, RUBB."
3220.08,3224.64," And the delivery and all the stuff is just sounds incredible. And I started looking up,"
3224.64,3228.72," you know, the translation through the lyrics and you know, translating myself and then, you know,"
3228.72,3232.96," filling in the blanks where I could. And I was like, okay, wow, this is neat because not only is it like,"
3232.96,3237.6," this is music that sounds great. Sounds great, but if it were say American, English, you know,"
3237.7599999999998,3242.48," language music, I would be prohibited for maybe liking as much as I do because the lyrics would be"
3242.48,3246.4," embarrassing, be bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it wasn't just that. I was like, wow, this is,"
3246.4,3251.2," is just a cool coincidence that these are good lyrics. You know, it's so far as an English-speaking"
3251.2,3257.2799999999997," person who's like deciphering French lyrics, but there, it wasn't stuff that it was immediately"
3257.2799999999997,3261.7599999999998, embarrassing. It wasn't like the equivalent of like rhyming ladies with Mercedes and party with
3261.84,3267.28," Picardian, that kind of shit, you know. So she's really into, you know, like, it is anti-globalization"
3267.28,3271.36," movement stuff. And so I started listening, so I branched out from there. I rocked out, so I'm"
3271.36,3278.88," way way way way way way way way the French hip hop. The French rapper is anti-globalization. Yeah, that's"
3278.88,3285.1200000000003," because most of the French hip-hop scenes from people who, if they, if their parents weren't,"
3285.1200000000003,3288.32," you know, born outside the country, or, you know, they were immediately from outside the country,"
3288.4,3293.04," so from French speaking, and sometimes on French speaking, like air-trade and some all-in-stop from"
3293.04,3297.76," the North African countries, some from South America. And so there's a lot of this kind of like"
3297.76,3303.28," post-colonial theme that go, and the French love that as well, you know, I mean, yeah, it's a big,"
3303.28,3307.52," you know, sort of post-modernism. But it's a little ironic, you know, being like post-colonial with"
3307.92,3312.7200000000003," like colonial culture with the colonial culture. Yeah, well, it's kind of, I mean, it's not just"
3312.7999999999997,3317.6," a simple colonialism as bad, I mean, it's not, I mean, well, it's not that, but globalization. Yeah."
3318.48,3322.16," So of course, they've built that, and there's some that like, yeah, they would want to say, like, yeah,"
3322.16,3327.2799999999997," we are, this is rap in French, as opposed to French rap. Yeah, you know, I mean, there's, there's"
3327.2799999999997,3331.7599999999998," some artists that actually want to distinguish that, and I mean, but I think the other thing about"
3331.7599999999998,3335.7599999999998," listen to is like, so I picked up some other artists, I was like, wow, I like these two,"
3335.7599999999998,3340.56, and then it was interesting to find out that I would start finding tracks with some of the same
3340.64,3345.68," artists that I was picking up together. And it reminded me of how like, you know, in English language"
3345.68,3351.2799999999997," music, like I'm really into, you know, sage Francis, and I was also, for a while, into Joly Holland,"
3351.2799999999997,3355.52," who's sort of like a folk singer, and the two have nothing in common. And then all of a sudden,"
3355.52,3360.4," like, on the next, like, sage album, a track turns up with her singing on it. Yeah. And I'm like,"
3360.4,3365.2799999999997," what the fuck? Like, how, how was that like, yeah, so the demographics painted. And I'm like,"
3365.36,3370.5600000000004," it's like, is it, is this even possible when I don't even understand the lyrics from another"
3370.5600000000004,3374.5600000000004," culture, and I'm still getting these kinds of overlaps and stuff, you know, but it makes me think about,"
3374.5600000000004,3379.76," like, to what extent is it the delivery of the music, to what extent is it the lyrics, all these"
3379.76,3383.52," other things? It's like kind of a nice mirror to hold up and make you think about, you know, what,"
3384.5600000000004,3388.7200000000003," what it is you like about music in the first place, you know, challenge just some of your,"
3388.7200000000003,3393.6800000000003," your, like, if people ask me, well, what is it that you like about the determines the, the"
3393.7599999999998,3398.08," rap rappers that you like, you might say, well, you know, it has to be the most insightful and thoughtful"
3398.08,3401.7599999999998," lyrics, it's just really clever stuff, wordplay and all the shit. But then that kind of gets thrown"
3401.7599999999998,3406.24," out the window right here, like, you're like, you're fighting out about the wordplay after the fact,"
3406.24,3411.12," you know, yeah, I honestly think that the difference between music you don't like and music that you"
3411.12,3417.04," do like is that music that you do like, let's you put your defenses down and let's you let the"
3417.04,3422.7999999999997," music do its thing. You can, I almost anyone can like almost any kind of music. Yeah, but you,"
3422.88,3428.88," you just resist it because it is a emotional kind of thing and it is for people of a certain age,"
3428.88,3436.6400000000003," like a identity defining thing that that you, your critical to like a crazy point, especially in"
3436.6400000000003,3443.1200000000003," like the era of like MP3 downloads and massive, you know, gigs of music out there or, you know,"
3443.1200000000003,3448.0800000000004," that you could listen to that, that once you find something you're like, I like this and you let"
3448.0800000000004,3452.4," those defenses down, you embrace it fully and it doesn't matter, like you accept all of its flaws,"
3452.7200000000003,3456.96," even if you find out after the fact that the lyrics are retired or whatever, you're just into it."
3456.96,3460.48," I mean, I find that with musical a time like it's all about like getting the point to where you're"
3460.48,3465.44," willing to just like let your critical mind turn off and yeah, because you're first to kind of"
3465.44,3469.6800000000003," scanning things for how though contributes to your identity package, you know, what are they going to"
3469.6800000000003,3473.92, say? They're going to signify about you in the same way that like your bookshelf does and all these other
3473.92,3478.2400000000002," things and you get to the point where you're like, listening to it for the sake of listening to it."
3478.3199999999997,3483.4399999999996," The other the other thing though was that like because I have absolutely most cases with music,"
3483.4399999999996,3488.0," I've always got someone who's on the same page, you know, like your close friends, you usually listen"
3488.0,3491.4399999999996," to the same stuff, you know, it's like in like roaring eyes, listening to the same stuff, but then"
3491.4399999999996,3496.0," it's like with this, you hit the one where you're like, there's no way anyone's going to listen to this"
3496.0,3499.8399999999997," yeah, be it. And you're like, it's kind of weird. It's like tearing cognita for music, you know,"
3499.8399999999997,3503.3599999999997," like just you're on your own with this man, like if people are coming over to your car, you're not"
3503.3599999999997,3507.68," playing it, you know, talk about music and I'm talking about it with anyone, which is kind of like"
3507.68,3512.3999999999996," I've been waiting to talk about it. Yeah, you know, that's how it is for me with like most music"
3512.3999999999996,3517.12," that like people don't really, I mean, I was still with just a lot of cheesy shit, like I really love"
3517.12,3522.56," the band, bread from the 70s. They're like an easy listening, like full crop band. I mean, I literally"
3522.56,3528.08, think they're like geniuses. And I just like a lot of like stuff that people think is super cheesy and
3528.7999999999997,3533.68," it's been like my time, like, you know, getting yelled at by my wife to like listen to some normal"
3533.68,3538.7999999999997," music because she likes, you know, like aggressive rock and roll music and I just keep like"
3538.7999999999997,3542.08, mellowing out over the years. Yeah. Max Chilest.
3544.08,3550.7999999999997," Yeah, we're love bread. Yeah. So with that, I go to our last 10 minutes on Conan. Sorry for"
3550.7999999999997,3554.3199999999997," these rapid jumps. I'm like looking at the clock. Um, yeah, we're clock watching today."
3554.3199999999997,3559.6," Let's get us like the warrior where episode. Yeah. Ryan, you started playing Sean of you started yet."
3559.6,3565.04," Nope. Nope. I think I've that the window has passed. Why, too? Why is that game?"
3565.04,3569.52, Because I keep reading about it. Why is that? Like it seems to be like a really popular
3569.52,3574.72, in the mo like out of nowhere. It seems like because I always when when a new mo in the mo comes
3574.72,3578.64," out, it always seems to just like fall down and this is the exception to the rule for"
3579.8399999999997,3584.16," what would. Why I don't know. Kind of like when when we first saw it, like when we last saw"
3584.24,3588.3199999999997," it, he three, remember? I was like the last thing I would have imagined myself playing."
3588.3199999999997,3594.3199999999997," To me, it seems that it's drawing a lot of pvp people. Yeah. Um, you know, it could be a"
3594.3199999999997,3600.7999999999997, many number of factors. It could be just burnout on current at MMO or in the tapence. It's
3600.7999999999997,3604.7999999999997, come along at the whole time. Maybe they maybe they weren't ready to jump to the next game when
3604.7999999999997,3609.44," then Tebula Ross came out months ago. You know, it could be a million things. I honestly didn't"
3609.52,3614.2400000000002," expect it to, but you don't find anything in the game that I didn't play it very far. Okay,"
3614.2400000000002,3618.56," everyone I've talked to find something in the game that I've just not interested in. So I'm like,"
3618.56,3622.48," well, you're talking about how the pvp is what's drawing you in and to me, I'm just like,"
3622.48,3626.4," I don't know, I don't really care. So why play this? Yeah. But what I had played in your group, though,"
3626.4,3630.0," that's also the other. And that's probably the biggest factor for me. Well, it is social because"
3630.0,3633.92," it's like if it's a Dunkin and Rory at Matt and James and Anthony weren't playing,"
3634.64,3639.2000000000003, I would not be on here talking about the pp makes it. I wouldn't even be playing. Right. So it's like
3639.2,3645.6," if you have, if if some catalysts that's the emotion and people in your group start playing,"
3645.6,3650.16," you'll end up playing it. Right. Yeah. I mean, the current, the way it works now is the people I play"
3650.16,3655.4399999999996," games with are playing Warcraft still. Yeah. Yeah. And anytime I've always been interested in,"
3655.4399999999996,3659.7599999999998," like almost everyone of those games that came out, Tebula Rossa, but like you need at least one"
3659.7599999999998,3663.04, of their person to jump over there with you that you want to play with. They have to hit like a
3663.04,3667.4399999999996," critical mask to you. I think this game hit for a lot of people hit that critical mask, like really"
3667.44,3672.8," early on. And that's what's you know. Yeah. So I wonder if if marketers ever try to, you know,"
3672.8,3678.8," because nowadays like it's all about getting like community and fluentials, whether be it in like"
3678.8,3686.48, clothing or music to to to advocate for a product to their to their friends and the people that
3686.48,3692.08," they're in a community with. I wonder if there's been any like, you know, age of Conan, like,"
3692.08,3696.2400000000002," that's a really good thing. But I mean, a good idea because yeah, I mean, you have like,"
3696.8799999999997,3702.72," trying to think of Malcolm Gladwell's terminology for it. I mean, which I found to be really effective,"
3702.72,3708.8799999999997," like it could explain a Tory power. But it's basically just like, but yeah, like early adopters"
3708.8799999999997,3714.64," is, you know, another way to look at it, but like the people who are, you know, setting, you know,"
3714.64,3718.56," trendsetters and early adopters to stop. But if you can isolate those, the alpha versions of those"
3718.56,3725.2799999999997, in MMOs and convince them or just bat them to play and have the game. I wonder if their friends
3725.36,3731.1200000000003," whether they can, they can set in motion like, you know, an avalanche. Yeah. If you get enough of them,"
3731.1200000000003,3736.5600000000004," that will build and actually start rolling and totally propose a conspiracy theory here. Like,"
3736.5600000000004,3741.6000000000004," we don't just have to grab eyeballs. We have to like grab like these pockets of people. Like,"
3741.6000000000004,3747.44," we have to, they all have to want to migrate. It's like trying to get you to move out of your"
3747.44,3755.76," city. Yeah. What I'm feeling now at level 32 in the game is, which may not seem like a lot,"
3755.76,3761.04," but it's taken quite a bit of time to get there. 32 is pretty. Is that there's, basically,"
3761.04,3766.2400000000002," I've just kind of like disappointed in the disconnect between the meta game. That's, that's,"
3766.2400000000002,3770.4, what's worth playing in any MMO and then the actual game. The actual game being
3771.44,3777.04, way have an infestation of infected wolves on the perimeter of our town go out and get me the
3777.04,3783.7599999999998," Pelt's and intestines of 24 of them. And the meta game would be when, say for example,"
3783.7599999999998,3789.12," we find this, this player and we start beating the shit out of them and we go to a spawn and keep"
3789.12,3793.12," beating the shit out of them and then he starts screaming how, oh, you guys are in for now. I got a"
3793.12,3798.64," whole like, I got a world of level 80s that are coming that are going to steam roll you. Oh, you,"
3798.64,3802.4, you think you were going to do some quest tonight. Good luck with that. And then just like basically
3802.48,3807.92," just keep, it's kind of like when you're in a forest and you get, you hear a Twigs nap, you get"
3807.92,3812.96," scared and you say, Robert, you got the shotgun good. I got the 45. It's like, this guy's doing this"
3812.96,3816.64," in the MMO world, like talking about it's like imaginary level 80s that are going to come and get them."
3816.64,3820.96, And then eventually he did get some friends and they weren't the ones that he was threatening us with.
3820.96,3825.2000000000003," And then you just tell them like we're going to just beat the shit out of all of you,"
3825.2000000000003,3829.84, getting in again unless you kicked the sky out of your guild and you didn't hear. And if you leave him
3829.84,3835.52," here to our mercy, then you guys may pet it and you may pass. And like that's the medigame and that's"
3835.52,3839.92," the fun part. And now imagine if instead, you know, if the guy but is that in the design document?"
3841.92,3847.28," The game also wants to encourage this kind of thing with like, you know, we just got our guild town."
3847.28,3851.76," We have our own, you know, we have our real estate and buildings. And this we're going to"
3851.76,3855.52, start defending it and it can be destroyed. And this is a way that it starts to integrate this into
3855.6,3859.6," the game properly. But what if like even at the point where I'm mad, it was able to say,"
3860.48,3866.48," you go talk say you go talk to the feudal Lord of the town. And his part of the usual thing,"
3866.48,3870.08," his text instead of that's the town's overrun by rats is that like, hey, I'm going to"
3870.08,3875.44, pop you guys here. These guys are thinking about rebelling against me. It's time for a little like
3875.44,3880.0," old bait and switch, you know, let's say that it's these these band of brigands that have been"
3880.0,3883.7599999999998, fucking it up for this whole town. I need you to go kill him. But then what it does is it randomly
3883.84,3889.1200000000003," finds, it finds like a group, a guild that's online in your area that's at a comparable level."
3889.1200000000003,3894.88," And says, you need to kill your mission is now kill five people in this guild. And then if you do"
3894.88,3898.8," that, and then you go back, then you get your reward and stuff. Then they're trying to run from you,"
3898.8,3903.1200000000003, whatever they're doing. It's like we now have to worry about instead of just arbitrary ganking for
3903.1200000000003,3906.88, this metagame and whatever like shit's and giggles these people are trying to have like that's
3906.88,3911.0400000000004," their their determined do it because it's part of the official world, you know. And it, I mean,"
3911.12,3914.4, you could do stuff like that. It's a short of the creaks. It seems of a solar empire
3914.4,3918.48," experimented with that, with the bounty system. Like that was a way that the game kind of said,"
3919.04,3922.72," you should attack these other people because of this unrelated game mechanic. Well, I mean,"
3922.72,3927.36," it's related to the players, but the game itself is kind of a strategy. Yes, it's integrating it."
3927.36,3932.72," Yeah, exactly. It's like you, you put a bounty on a mercenary thing and oh, I'm looking"
3932.72,3937.52," out the door. Not yet, warning almost though. So I'd like to see that. Ryan, you've got a different"
3937.6,3945.6," take on it. Low level play and not playing with, you know, well, I have a level five character."
3945.6,3953.28, So take this the grain of sorrow. I have not played very much of this game. But my sort of
3953.28,3959.36, knee jerk reaction to Conan so far. And I'm going to eat playing more just to see how it turns out
3959.36,3963.7599999999998, because you've been telling me about all the hygiene you guys have got. You got to do it. You should
3963.76,3967.44," feel to you because you always complain that the game is just they don't make them like,"
3967.44,3973.1200000000003, I'll come online anymore. Wow. Wow. This still doesn't sound like all the more. Did you see the
3973.1200000000003,3978.7200000000003," video, the video of the guy with the horse approaches, ultimately, online. He basically gets his horse."
3978.7200000000003,3982.5600000000004," He goes to these canyon walls where you're taking these mountain trails that are only like,"
3982.5600000000004,3987.76," like, not wide enough for two people walking and he backs the horse up and he just waits there."
3987.76,3992.2400000000002," And he's level 80 so that if there's level 30's come and buy, they're like, let's just run by."
3992.3199999999997,3996.56, But then he kicks him with the horses they go by and knocks him off the mountain where they fall
3996.56,4000.24, into their desk. And the video hasn't doing it over and over again. Of course it's playing
4000.24,4005.12," the acuity sax, but it's like, imagine you're the gatekeeper. It's like, you killed this fucking"
4005.12,4008.9599999999996, guy in the horse or you get your ass kicked off the mountain every time you want to go or
4008.9599999999996,4013.8399999999997," or upgrade or something. That's, that's not ultimate, but that's pretty good. That's the spirit of"
4013.92,4019.1200000000003," Ultima and it does live in the game to some extent. Oh, god. Well, so, so my thing like,"
4019.1200000000003,4024.8," my need to your reaction to this game, you know, I'm still in the new area. I guess you're in the"
4024.8,4036.0," new area pretty much all over 20. Um, it's mechanically, it's, it's just like, wow. I mean, it's like,"
4036.0,4041.92," I look at this and I'm like, I've done this before. Why do I want to get invested in this thing?"
4042.0,4047.12," Like, it's fundamentally like the same game that World of Warcraft is and and Lord the Rings Online."
4047.76,4053.44," And like, it makes, it doesn't seem, in this brief window of time that I've played, it seems like"
4053.44,4060.48," these mechanics are all sort of exactly the same. Yeah, I would agree for the, rather than compared"
4060.48,4064.32," to World Warcraft, which I haven't played, but I played some Lord of the Rings and auto-salt and"
4064.32,4069.2000000000003," Guild Wars and yeah, on that level that I always talk about, those games are all the same."
4069.2799999999997,4074.72," Like, they have different, they have different embellishments on them, but structurally they're all identical."
4075.7599999999998,4082.0," And, you know, I've been, again, obviously not firsthand, but I've been seeing some people complain that"
4082.0,4087.6, the end of game isn't quite so varied once you hit level 80. This is people are already getting
4087.6,4094.64," a little bit. Yeah, 50 on 50 to 60 is supposed to be a big content gap. Right. And then perhaps"
4094.72,4103.28," it's 70 to 80 with 60 to 70 being fine, but yeah, that's, but once you hit that level cap,"
4105.68,4110.5599999999995," like I look at, wow, wow, how is the one exception where, you know, like Blizzard has this philosophy"
4110.5599999999995,4114.48," where it's like, you know, we need to hurry up and get people those level caps that they can experience"
4114.48,4120.32," the real game that kind of starts at that point. And most of them, and those, and this is my"
4121.28,4125.12," I'm just using Age of Conan sort of a jumping off point, but my problem with most of them,"
4125.12,4130.88," I was just like, you know, you're not working toward anything. Once you hit that level cap,"
4130.88,4134.799999999999," there's really like, like, load of the rings on my ass, like, here's these two dungeons that you can do."
4135.44,4142.32," And it's like, that's, that's really it. And, you know, for, for an ememow to really pull me away"
4142.32,4147.679999999999," from from World of Warcraft at this point, and it needs to be at least as sophisticated as World of Warcraft"
4148.0,4153.200000000001," out the gate. Like, I need to know that I'm working. Right. I haven't heard anything about Conan's,"
4153.200000000001,4157.200000000001," like, and game quote unquote, this kind of stuff I'm doing now and wow, that really interests me."
4157.200000000001,4162.400000000001," I heard anything about it. It's the rating and all of that. What, when you do a raid when you do a,"
4162.400000000001,4167.6," or in, and you're no longer can get up to a higher level, there's a difference for your"
4167.6,4171.12," direction. It's what's your motivation. It's like a gear progression at that point. I mean,"
4171.12,4176.0," you're still attaining stuff to get to the next stuff, but it's kind of a more protracted and way more"
4176.08,4180.96," social. I could actually, yeah, at least, at least in Wilds structure. Yeah, I think that's like what Ryan"
4180.96,4185.84," saying. It's like, you Ryan wants it out the gate and here. I mean, I want to know that they're talking"
4185.84,4190.4," about something that they're going to do. Wait, right now, some of that is in the PvP, and it's in"
4190.4,4195.12," like, like I was saying about like destroying other people's towns, raising their villages. Is that,"
4195.12,4200.32," I look at that. And I said, like, do you know if you're heard anything about Shadowbane?"
4200.4,4203.36," That's right about it, but I haven't played it."
4203.36,4208.719999999999," Age of Conan to me, all the, all the like town raising and all that stuff. It seems to me like it's"
4208.719999999999,4215.44," trying to be in a way what Shadowbane was, but you know, very similar. Players can build towns and"
4215.44,4223.84," have these guild alliances and attack other people's towns. And, you know, I played that game for"
4223.92,4229.4400000000005," good four or five months. And that sort of stuff was like, all there was."
4230.88,4236.72," I know, I'm crazy about PvP. I love PvP, but I don't want that to, that can't be the only thing."
4236.72,4240.400000000001," Right. Right. Yeah. So like, they, they, they just say that they won't add the equivalent of"
4240.400000000001,4244.08," raids and stuff that you don't make sure that will, but it's like, if you want that now, even though"
4244.08,4248.56," you're level five, the other thing that they differentiate, you guys are probably the ideal consumer"
4248.56,4252.56, if they can get you because you'll continue to play. I don't look at it. I'm not going to play.
4252.56,4256.96," I can tell you now, because I don't want to play any MMO, like, I don't like month after month."
4256.96,4261.280000000001," The way I play company here is, you know, like I, I've already got my money's worth out of it for,"
4261.280000000001,4266.400000000001," you know, the $50 game and like, I'll play it for the 30 days I have and get as high as I can. And,"
