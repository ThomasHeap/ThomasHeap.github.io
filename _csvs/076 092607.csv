0.0,4.76, Hi and welcome to a special edition of GFW radio
5.76,8.6, You're getting to this week if everything goes well
9.16,13.56, This is Jeff Green the editor and chief of Game Store windows magazine and we are here
14.16,22.44, The very special guest today. We have Chavat yearly the CEO of Critec here to talk to us about
23.44,25.72, His upcoming game what the heck is it called?
25.72,27.96, I know it's called it's crisis
27.96,30.36," Yeah, so hi, why there?"
30.84,35.0, Also on board our Darren Gladstone Sean Elliott and Sean Maloy
35.96,39.68, So how long have you been over here in the US?
40.4,43.24," Actually, I just arrived yesterday is the morning and"
44.08,48.84, Some people there's a mystery I was here for last two weeks because I showed up two weeks ago
49.2,53.8," But no, no, no, I wasn't the office cranking on the bucks making sure the crisis chips and"
54.84,57.84," Yeah, so I just flew in yesterday morning"
57.96,63.56," Well, we'll try not to ask two hard questions if you're not I'm still in a jet neck. I'm about to go to bed now"
63.56,69.56," I mean, you're not gonna go back to your room and play Halo 3 and no, I'm flushing in not or maybe flushing in. I don't know"
71.96000000000001,74.76, So right before we turned on the machine here
74.76,78.56, I was informed that it was a little bit deliberate that the crisis
79.44,82.28, Beta started it about the same time as the Halo 3 launch
82.8,84.8," Yes, and because"
84.8,90.39999999999999, It wasn't deliberate per se in terms of to confront but the date was picked in deliberately because
90.72,93.8, We said we have to make sure that crisis gets its pay the time and
95.16,98.24, It coincided that it was same time with Halo 3
98.39999999999999,100.96, But we said we should not move out because of hands-free
101.28,108.67999999999999," Yeah, so the liberal decision was not to move out because of hands-free, but we didn't care for any other releases because it's not PC platform"
109.32,113.97999999999999, And so the game profiles are different and I guess we should talk about that
113.98,114.98, Maybe
115.78,122.5," So you weren't scared of Halo 3 that no, because it's a 360 it's a it's a game which people wait for 360 and"
122.9,124.9, Crisis a game for PC clearly
125.74000000000001,129.94," So and it's clearly has enough of its own hype. I think yeah, I mean"
130.98000000000002,135.36, We happy with the amount of hype we have so we don't need more hype built through Halo 3
135.36,136.36, Uh-huh
136.36,139.62, I guess we get to kill this podcast and if it doesn't need more hype
140.14000000000001,141.14000000000001, Well
141.14000000000001,144.8, I'm not here to build high of I guess I'm you continue 3
147.3,152.42000000000002," Sorry, we invited you that's right part of part of the the difference that you're saying"
152.42000000000002,154.62, I mean clearly their different audiences
154.62,160.78, There's gonna be some overlap in the same way that all of us here are will eventually play Halo 3 some of some already been playing it as a last night
160.94,166.22, But I wanted to know a little bit more about who you specifically see as you know outside of the
167.18,173.96," Vagreys of everybody is being your potential audience, but who do you really see as your audience and to tie that into two other questions"
173.96,178.98, I see and comments that are most frequently made about the game though someone we talked about before one is that
180.02,183.7, So you know for example someone's on a message board and they post a screen
183.7,188.06, Here's a new video of crisis. Here's a new screen shot everyone goes oh my god that looks great
188.06,192.1, Then the next comments and they're always in the next post you can guarantee it is
192.54,195.38, Too bad my computer won't run that and then
195.9,198.29999999999998, Too bad it just looks good and there's no game there
198.29999999999998,202.98," So you can hit those neither order, but I think the too bad my computer won't run that ties in"
204.14,210.14," Pretty clearly with the notion of audience and who the game is for yeah, it's like when I see the new Lombogini"
210.74,213.06, picture recently and by the international
213.06,218.42, The IA I said to but I don't have the money to buy the car it looks great enough
218.42,224.85999999999999, So the point here is crisis is a hard-co game like targeted a primary for hardcore
225.46,231.7, But of course it scales back and so if you don't have the money at the pockets effectively to have the equipment to play crisis
232.18,234.98, As it should be played you can of course have it with your
235.54,238.66, Three to two to three years or two to four years old hardware
239.38,241.38, Consolation effectively
241.38,245.54, But more important is it's what I use the term lead gamer
246.26,253.42," No, the lead gamer is effectively somebody who has the top hand hand hardware has all the best games"
253.5,261.5, But talks to his friends gamers and leads them effectively and so crisis game for lead gamer hardcore gamer
262.21999999999997,266.62," Into theast at the high-end market, but at same time full-fills the"
267.02,272.91999999999996, People who don't have the deposits for the people that don't have the depots and are playing is there enough to the game
273.34,280.41999999999996, To sort of sustain itself and it's just fight itself as being something to pay attention to if you're not having that the visual
281.38,285.54," Yes, because the bar is this it's very simple in two to three years ago"
285.94,291.22, Like when I look at crisis and let's say fuck right I compared them because we don't have both of them
291.46000000000004,297.62, So if you play crisis means by effectively it will look somewhere between high to very high and
297.62,298.42, Fakre
298.42,301.22," So if you were happy with Fakre, it'll be happy with crisis"
301.62,303.06, But the same PC
303.06,307.1, But to play crisis high and very high you have to buy a new PC
307.26000000000005,310.12, It's a generational jump. I mean crisis one generation
311.12,313.62, Far Cry crisis is the next generation
313.98,319.52000000000004," You know, so that needs a new generation PC at the same time it scales even first and now"
319.52000000000004,323.38," So so from that angle yes, you will be able to play single player"
323.5,324.54, There's no
324.54,328.90000000000003, Effectively no game play difference frame mates my very visuals my very very
329.1,334.02000000000004, But the immersion factor coming through the visuals coming through the amount of simulations around you
334.58,338.34, That will only be really present on the high and configurations and
339.38,342.5, But from the gameplay from the action itself it won't differ
343.02,347.91999999999996, So it will be the same and multiply is a bit different story. So we went extra males
348.29999999999995,352.41999999999996, Like we could have made just a one version of multiplayer right and power struggle and say okay
352.41999999999996,355.7, We have one multiplayer version that scales has different configurations
356.09999999999997,361.74, But we went the extra step to make sure a power struggle in this case receives a dexten version
362.26,365.7, But the dexten version is not related to the extent per se
365.86,372.3," We took the only the opportunity of moment if you want and said hey, it was introduction of 8800"
372.3,378.90000000000003, The end the extension we could use it and cut off the minspecs to introduce next generation of more online game
378.90000000000003,384.94, You know as a minimum hardware base because anybody who has an 1800 or plus in the future
384.94,391.22, He can play with time of day now with physics with breakables in a multiplayer game that feels like a thing
391.34000000000003,398.34000000000003, Plicks brains and so we took that as an opportunity and at the same time we have the dext nine and multiplayer
399.06,403.58000000000004, For the people of now or the past because when I when I develop a game
403.58000000000004,409.14000000000004, I always think of how can we make sure that this is a game for the past for the present and for the future
409.46000000000004,414.22, How can we scale the five years centrally three years in the past and three years in the future?
414.34000000000003,417.98, It's kind of the the benefits because if I have a favorite game
418.78000000000003,421.82," I want to play it like four to five years, you know ideally"
422.06,425.18, So when I when I buy now when I play my favorite game today
425.18,429.1," It's gonna look the same again, but crisis in two years will look different. It will look better"
429.5,430.62, Then today
430.62,436.46000000000004, So you do expect odd it to be you know selling strongly to use for now for us and then five years from now
436.62,438.62, Well if crisis becomes
439.38,441.62, Classing in people's mind game as mind
442.14000000000004,446.86, There will be a good reason why you can buy crisis turn two years and it's gonna be still set of the art
447.18,451.42, Because it will adapt and configure itself to the high-end configurations
451.82,453.82, So you will get a so
453.98,459.26, By the time in two years if a game play a game does not appear with similar gameplay the compete in gameplay and
459.58000000000004,461.42, On the visual the adapted visuals
461.58000000000004,464.62, So it's gonna be still set of the art gameplay and set of serviceials
465.5,469.5, Usually a classic game does become outdated by visuals by remains classified by gameplay
470.14,473.46000000000004, So crisis hopefully will remain classic by gameplay and
473.78,476.9, Adapt to be trained the visuals all the time. That's the
477.29999999999995,481.38, Those of you in it well I remember back when we when you were after you released Far Cry
481.38,486.97999999999996, I forget exactly how long after but you you did not you updated that 60 64-bit version is so
486.97999999999996,491.94, I mean so theoretically you could just continue following up with crisis and I don't know that later
491.94,494.26," Yeah, I mean we haven't built in now"
494.34,498.02, That's a good thing is in crisis we learned from Far Cry people appreciated it
498.34,503.38, So we said we could build a part of this already in but we still have to because we don't know the profile
503.38,507.94, Future hardware we know only about six and nine months out so we have prototypes of new hardware
508.34,513.9399999999999, But we don't know what will end video RTI or MDA or Intel will come up in the next two years
514.5,520.42," You know I mean they won't tell us at the stage though, but as soon we know any information"
520.98,526.02, We will out-to-patch crisis with some profile hints and as soon you buy it
526.66,531.06, The game will start configuring to the configuration so we much center patches
531.78,537.54, And we may do content upgrades in addition like a higher-risk textures like quadruple textures for example
537.6199999999999,541.6199999999999," We may do that in a half year one year, but we'll try to maintain for surely"
542.26,546.7399999999999, We'll try to update surely the shaders that content we will hopefully do it
547.3,549.3, But minimum profile
549.3,553.9399999999999, So I guarantee you in two years from now you can ask me that two years again
554.7399999999999,559.6999999999999, You should in two years from now you will have a crisis that is completely different and visual quality then today
560.26,566.5, It will look just better and it will be our goal and and strive will be to make sure crisis always leading
567.3000000000001,572.82, In the experience and really is now but keep it there keep it up there essentially in your analogy
573.0600000000001,578.6600000000001, You know you're basically positioning crisis as the the blonde bond shell who also has a PhD
579.5400000000001,581.5400000000001, And granted that condition
581.5400000000001,588.74, Grand it that you know the way that the game looks is is not entirely separate from the way that the game plays the two are in or
589.14,595.94, But putting that aside for a moment what specifically is the nature of the PhD of crisis the blonde bond shell?
596.42,598.42," Well, it's"
598.42,600.66, Intelligence the artificial intelligence
601.38,603.62, Which makes her or crisis in
604.9,611.38, Intelligent the artificial technology we spend in to refine just even the one one one one combat like
612.02,613.78, You against one AI
613.86,622.5, Fields substantially more intelligent and tuned through the AI quality and level design effect that I feel that our game feels more intelligent
623.22,629.06, More a requires to think more so it needs more challenging in terms of outsmarting the experience
630.18,632.18, So that alone is
632.18,639.22, One aspect second aspect is all the technology we added for the for example for the aliens for the whole driver
640.02,643.46, AI for the pilot AI for the squad match
643.86,649.0600000000001," Squad AI not like so we have whole squad tactics, but they they stay not in your way at least"
649.5400000000001,651.94, So this is actually an achievement in games today
652.6600000000001,655.0600000000001, And if you look at the AI technology and
655.7,662.34, The other things like assessing the environments the way they assess the way the the sense of work in the fact that we had just vision
662.34,664.5, But in class we have perforial vision and
665.38,668.34, Vision you know like we have this vision and this vision effectively
668.58,674.4200000000001, Like a view of rest of 90 degree and 180 degree simulations that were right that tunes the stealth gameplay
674.98,681.94, So and now they are also in the context of are you to a very visible on like they evaluate the visibility more
682.6600000000001,686.02, And they can differentiate between what they hear how loud they hear
686.58,692.82, I remember one of the original criticisms we had back in Far Cry 1 was that the AI almost seemed
693.7800000000001,701.46, To aware of your presence especially right at first yeah where you would pop around a corner and a guy from real far away
701.46,705.86, That won't happen. So that's exactly this kind of things we nailed down as well
706.34,707.86, with
707.86,708.9000000000001, We were
708.9000000000001,713.46, Crazy for the difficulty of fun cry we were crazy as for AI that can see
714.2600000000001,716.9000000000001, Same quality in near you or distance
717.6999999999999,722.66, So now the peripheral vision and the vision changed by distance and by the context
723.38,728.02, You know so the the vision and sensors are tuned and
728.8199999999999,730.18, Nexonational
730.18,734.74, Through that and that refined the core gameplay now for some if you run behind a bush
735.3,740.8199999999999," Have a still shooting it, but in fact, I had there was a moment for example if the bush was closer to"
741.54,744.9, Me and I run into the behind the bush
745.22,750.5799999999999," The the AI would spray fire because he would see I'm running behind the bush to take cover, but he's not stupid"
750.5799999999999,754.26, He says I just run in so he's gonna shoot into the bush right
754.74,757.6999999999999, But where the system failed was it didn't
758.26,763.38," Check this is when the player run into behind the bush, but the bush was closer to the AI"
765.06,769.3, What means that the bush was just in the past of the AI and his player but the play didn't deliver it
769.3,772.5799999999999," They run into the bush. They I just thought hey, he's running me on a bush"
772.74,776.74, That felt like cheating because the bush was like AI was
777.7800000000001,785.14, 2m it was a bush and and 50m the player was and so this looked like cheating because he didn't understand the bush actually is not for me
785.14,787.14, But for it one of him
788.0200000000001,794.5, I don't know if it makes it or it's what if you what why do you think that that now for for games like yours?
795.14,800.1800000000001, Like this the just listening to talk about the AI it seems like it must be so hard for you guys to
800.66,806.42, To do and to think of all those situations and to get to the the enemies to think and react in that way
806.66,812.0999999999999," And if you think back to older FPSs, I mean, you know the duums and quakes or whatever"
812.0999999999999,816.9, I mean these were monsters that just ran straight at you with no intelligence and we all lived with that
816.9,820.9," Yeah, why do you think it's different the difference is very simple because we don't have"
821.6999999999999,823.6999999999999, corridors we don't have
823.6999999999999,827.06, strict scenarios where we excited no what the player will do
827.9399999999999,831.9399999999999, In fact we don't want the not that we don't it's not a bad thing that we don't have it
832.26,838.0999999999999, In fact we delivered design decided not to have it the whole point about our game is that I want to play it as
838.0999999999999,840.0999999999999, Sing before it does anything
840.0999999999999,844.9799999999999, We've and that's the core gameplay difference in Fakura introduced and I think it's a concept which we
845.6999999999999,851.2199999999999, As our first game we kind of did it but it was like an apprenticeship burst and we
851.54,856.9799999999999, Perfection that this is crisis now we said this is a something like we said we have something here
857.78,863.78, And this coolness now outsmart and gameplay we have to refine and the core of crisis and so we took all the
863.78,869.94, Know-how and and critique from Fakura and really focused on the one-on-one combat itself to nail that
870.4200000000001,876.5," Once we had that in mind like once that we had in place we sent that okay, let's work on the group tactics like to make the group"
876.5,882.26, Really be intelligent and and smart now they have to react on different distances different
882.8199999999999,884.8199999999999, Audio profiles how loud you are
885.78,895.06, Visibility profiles your suit modes the environment you know which in context you are so the context of the AI what to recognize and analyze is
895.62,897.62, Way bigger than Evan Fakura and
898.18,904.26, That is to accommodate the PhD degree of the play or the the blonde PhD degree thing you were talking before shown
904.8199999999999,907.22, They fact that the crisis has an unassute
907.5400000000001,911.3000000000001, Confirgable weapons system the open open environments
911.78,916.98, Effectively a different time the time settings everything together that's needs an
917.86,920.34, Encounter that actually can encounter intelligently and
921.38,927.7, Then we met a lot about the past finding system in crisis which actually the AI
928.58,933.7, Has to once he knows what to do he has to go to a position now in Fakura the world will static
934.26,940.1," In crisis the world's complex dynamic now again, it needs much more AI technology behind it to make the play AI"
940.1800000000001,943.1400000000001, Position intelligently and everyone that is dynamic a
943.7,949.1400000000001, Compit different shell is obstacle avoidance dynamic passion navigation pass navigation networks
949.62,953.7, Like things which it's one reason why with fear which is you know
953.7,960.74, Among critics is regarded as having excellent AI but in that game all the environments in the context on which that AI can act out
960.9,966.34," It's very soft to are pretty constrained. Yes, come to design very specifically to foster and encourage"
967.22,972.34," And they did a great job for there yeah, but I mean and you're talking about environments where rather than a"
973.86,976.58, Series of inner rooms interconnected by three hallways
976.82,981.0600000000001, You know and you have a very finite set of entry points and exit points for your AI actors
981.0600000000001,983.46, You have a field with rocks trees
983.86,987.22, You know shacks and all these other things. We have a sandpot. You right
987.94,992.26, And we have a sandbox where the play can come from anywhere. You can use anything here
992.26,999.3000000000001, Can you use an institute mode and he can be playing as a long range as the action guy as a tactical as tells
999.86,1001.86, Like all different places as a full of featured
1002.98,1009.86, Where you would need normally four gates four games to play with this is like all game play styles play styles in one
1010.4200000000001,1014.98, And encountered by an AI that can actually assess both and give you a good experience by that
1015.0600000000001,1017.0600000000001, So do you worry at all that
1017.22,1023.0600000000001, The players are gonna be able to because it's so open and there's so many ways to do it in the AI has so much work to do
1023.38,1029.6200000000001, That there'll be a bit of find some seams or some cracks where they can slip through and fool the game or you confident at this point
1029.6200000000001,1035.6200000000001," Did I'm confident and we found all these things, but you know, I want like that whole life on is right"
1036.34,1041.6200000000001, But I hope we won't happen and but the thing is the fact is that the AI is intelligent enough
1041.9399999999998,1045.9399999999998, So if the player finds that say somewhere polygonal edge where he can shoot through
1046.6599999999999,1051.54, The AI will try to steal flesh and mountains things like this so there's some exception handling we implemented it
1051.78,1054.1799999999998, But principally our goal was to make sure that the AI
1055.1399999999999,1056.1799999999998, reacts on
1056.1799999999998,1061.6999999999998, Being shot at as a prime prime number one rule that means so if you shoot that in no matter where you are
1062.34,1065.4599999999998," The AI is gonna shoot back to you somehow you know, so"
1066.18,1068.02, So there will be a
1068.02,1073.38, VERSCASE scenario still will be handled this comment and if they can't if they can't shoot you
1073.94,1077.38, They will find a way to move closer to you yes more throw grenades at you
1078.58,1082.26, So there will be ways how they will attack you but principally and
1083.14,1090.02, Again the sum of technology we added and I want to I because I'm getting off track of the PhD thing because there's much more about what crisis makes
1090.5,1094.66, Intelligent the AI technology is one thing but the level design itself
1095.6200000000001,1100.26, The level design the systems in terms of the non-osuit and the customers weapons stem
1101.14,1107.6200000000001, The whole thing that the entire gameplay asks you as a gamer to think about it and so
1108.18,1114.74, I see this way if if a girl which I admit is brainless she wouldn't ask me questions right she wouldn't make missing
1115.3000000000002,1117.3000000000002," So I would just think she's hot, but"
1117.94,1124.02, That that that whole girl which is PhD degree is actually getting more interest of me because she's also asking the interest
1124.26,1127.54," In questions that might be a bit more substance in the relationship, you know"
1128.1,1134.34, So crisis will have a better relationship to the gamer sure in the spectrum of of storytelling in FPSs
1134.58,1142.42, You know that will include you know halo at one position on it half-life series and then maybe some of the earlier the original doom games
1142.82,1147.94, Where that would be on the very you know extreme of this of a spectrum where it's basically just action
1148.5,1149.78, Where do you see
1149.86,1156.98, Both you know crytac as a studio's position on it and specifically the game crisis. I mean where where does it fall in there
1157.86,1163.06," And so did to find this better so say for example in halo you you have an emphasis on cutscenes, you know where you have"
1163.62,1167.86, Action that's very much that's very similar to what you're describing where it's about tactics
1167.86,1171.06, It's about the feedback of the combat and stuff but maybe with
1172.42,1174.42, lesser emphasis on
1174.5800000000002,1181.46, The sense of immersion and you know the realness of the environment or something like that and then you know with half-life or something or even
1181.46,1187.3000000000002, BioShock where you have where you know you're not you're never interrupting the game to show you'll movie
1187.3000000000002,1190.02," That's not at part of a game technically speaking, you know"
1190.74,1192.74, So you know where and where and where and that
1192.98,1196.66, You know where in that spectrum is your game because people we talk about the action all the time
1196.66,1199.6200000000001, But we don't we do talk about the story and so far as we know aliens come
1200.1799999999998,1205.6999999999998, Koreans are here Americans are there and we all fighting but what about I think the one thing you
1205.6999999999998,1211.1399999999999, Understand is I think what what you should do is because the story is something I mean we always are
1211.1399999999999,1218.34, Encounter with technology questions and and this game like it was AI questions and I see some of the other game
1218.34,1222.58, In TV's where they only talk about story and only tell what visual depending on the strengths of the studio
1222.58,1227.4599999999998, It seems to be I'm actually was saying into Andrew why they don't talk about the story on characters
1227.54,1232.58," It's a little bit but they say well, you know you're looked at as like the studio as it what we interchange that you know"
1233.3,1234.58, So
1235.22,1239.22, principally the way we emphasize story a lot in terms of making sure
1239.78,1243.6200000000001," We tell a good story, but it's same though I want to say that we know the story"
1244.5,1249.22, That has the the cries of PhD degree to understand easier like speaking of PhD degrees again
1250.58,1254.3400000000001, That means that if you it's very easy to follow
1254.8999999999999,1256.8999999999999, Has characters the tuberal character
1258.34,1263.78, Set up but also it's important that it we don't tell stories through
1264.98,1269.06, Cutscenes like so so cuts in which are out of your view
1269.9399999999998,1272.5, or through radio messages or through
1273.4599999999998,1278.58, tapes you find or or speakers while like in a way that it's through
1279.54,1285.62," View effectively, but what we do is we show the story right around you inconsistent entirely of verbs"
1285.62,1291.62," Right yeah, it's a far as you have a story there. It's it's action it's a plot that happens"
1291.62,1298.1, But the plot is directly correlated to all the objectives and the action the players and everything you do has a meaningful
1299.3,1303.9399999999998, Development for the characters of or you as a gamer and you bring the story forward
1304.3400000000001,1310.26, But usually what happens is some games there's a world already which is in a state
1311.06,1314.8200000000002, a fixed date and it has effectively a backstory only and
1315.8600000000001,1320.66, What happens is that you find out through nuggets of information what happened there to get to state
1321.14,1326.8200000000002, In crisis the world alone the environment is the framework and the island itself is in framework
1326.8200000000002,1329.8600000000001, A character that evolves effectively to tell a story
1330.5800000000002,1333.38, But not through dialogue that is spoken to you
1333.94,1336.5, But rather through the visual transformation of the world
1336.98,1341.6200000000001, You know the the world evolves around you as you go through the actions that you correlate to
1342.02,1344.74, your objectives and objects for correlated to the overarching story
1345.3,1349.8600000000001, So I think I feel that all the core gameplay we talked about in the the sandbox screens
1350.42,1354.18, are always converged into the moments where something happens around the in the world
1354.42,1358.98, But in through visuals and through animations that means shit the world is changing you know
1359.54,1366.58, Them something's happening again so that's how we tell the story through the ambient storytelling number one as a message
1367.46,1373.6200000000001, Ambience by being the visual ambience the world the second way the means for us in terms of stories
1374.02,1376.02, Developing a plot rather backstory
1377.14,1383.94, So very important is there's a situation in the world but the situation and your original mission changes completely
1384.66,1386.66, everything develops and everything transforms
1387.14,1389.14, And
1389.8600000000001,1394.9, Last but not least I would say that story in terms of cutscenes we have cutscenes in the game
1395.14,1397.7, But they always in the point of view of the player so
1398.42,1405.22, Whilst we interrupt the game action we don't take it away the player is that a tradition are you talking more about like you know
1405.22,1410.66, Say for example there are moments in bio shock or half life or something where they will constrain player movement
1410.66,1414.3400000000001," Yeah, so that you're you're still able to look around"
1414.5,1419.6999999999998, But it's keeping you in a place so people like make their marks and act in a way and then a cutscene
1419.6999999999998,1424.4199999999998," Sometimes you'll get a letter boxing effect and it will play for you. No, it's actually a hybrid of that"
1424.8999999999999,1430.1, It's it's first person view but it's letter boxed because we want to tell you something there
1430.1,1435.3799999999999, I would want you to listen to it and if you don't listen it's okay because there's still ambient information enough
1435.78,1437.78, To tell you what's going on anyway
1437.78,1443.6999999999998, But we want to keep the story and and give us some chunks the liver to you
1444.02,1452.9, In to converge the sandbox experience and to bring the story forward effectively through points of storytelling methods
1452.9,1459.6200000000001," But through crafted a choreographed cutscenes, but they always from the first person you that's for me important"
1460.26,1463.3, So then you will never see your seven set person effectively
1463.8600000000001,1467.6200000000001," Clearly, I mean I got the hint when I visited you guys in Frank for before that that"
1468.1799999999998,1474.8999999999999, Crisis I mean you had big plans for that you even you already talked about I mean you you more or less
1474.8999999999999,1476.8999999999999, We're talking about the notion that
1478.1799999999998,1479.54," Okay, let's back it up because"
1479.54,1486.0, Here's something to change this was an important change originally you had the alien ship crash lands in the South China Chinese
1486.0,1491.9799999999998," See it creates this you know tsunami, you know all this stuff and now when I last spoke with you the notion is instead more like"
1491.98,1499.8600000000001, Where the worlds were these things are things you know as we're getting at but this thing in the first crisis game is already there first
1499.8600000000001,1501.46, Because very in the
1501.46,1504.3, And then it come and then it's exposed you know
1504.3,1508.22, You by some sort of activity it activates or something but so you
1508.7,1511.78, Before you were saying you know in our mod of these things are coming toward earth and now
1511.78,1516.98, I would assume the equation would just change to again like where the worlds there's up and our mod of them already
1517.26,1520.06, buried throughout the planet the thing is we don't oh and
1520.06,1525.34, And even in the end of the game you don't know what you know is that effectively
1525.34,1530.98," Well, you know this would be a spoiler what I'm talking about but I will know I will not try to spoil it"
1530.98,1532.98, So the way I say this is
1533.3799999999999,1536.74, Crisis is is encapsuled in terms of
1537.7,1542.1399999999999, How what happened there so it tells the story what happened?
1542.5,1549.1399999999999, King about some of the backstory but also develop support so that what happened is like in a time frame of
1550.1399999999999,1554.1799999999998, I would say one half hour into the game then a about one hour later
1554.1799999999998,1559.4199999999998, You've start actually moving things forward to the point to find out what happened and things what's happening now
1559.78,1561.78, till did the end of the game
1561.78,1562.98, but
1562.98,1564.98, The question was there are more of them
1566.26,1568.26, Completely unanswered in fact and
1569.26,1571.26, I would say that
1571.26,1574.8799999999999, Might be likely right here's here's a
1574.88,1583.0," No, I don't try to it. Look at put it this way, but EA would be very well served to have a premier first person shooter franchise"
1583.2,1588.2800000000002," Yeah, I mean like clearly it's got a like you know just for a business perspective"
1588.2800000000002,1591.0400000000002, You look active. It's got called duty which is doing very well
1591.0400000000002,1596.92, You know halo they're very southern no brainers and it and that's one category that in my mind at least
1596.92,1599.5200000000002, I'm this is subjective you know every other people might disagree
1599.92,1603.72," You might disagree, but they do know at the time EA does not have a"
1604.08,1610.92, First person shooter that's premier in the sense that it is like people look to it in the way you would call duty in the way you would
1611.56,1613.92, Hail with the exception of with the exception of crisis
1614.28,1618.84, So if if it's successful to the point where you know you're in a partnership with them now
1618.84,1625.76, But it's not direct. I mean they don't own the studio or anything would you and you've already been in it in a situation where you've lost control of
1626.08,1628.52, Creation far cry would you not
1628.52,1635.2, The game number successful will you give the whole thing over to you or you just assume I mean I assume you continue to work with them on it
1635.2,1637.72, But I mean just thinking that far ahead
1637.72,1643.32, I mean it's got to be in your studio's mind right now because you're on the verge right now finding out if if your game is going to be
1644.52,1648.48, Success to that degree where it's not no no that's it's complete different topics
1649.24,1655.12, The way I want to explain first of its fuck right we didn't lose it. We sold actually the rights to you was okay
1655.12,1657.36, So they just can do whatever the one was it and
1658.36,1663.24," It was a bit of a hard move for us, but we want to focus that money to create something new"
1663.9199999999998,1671.9599999999998, So that means with crisis for example our new creation now the fact that crisis actually on the design on as a
1672.8799999999999,1674.8799999999999, More than one version
1674.8799999999999,1677.1599999999999, Effectively yeah is already as ignorant
1677.1599999999999,1681.84," Crowd so yeah, no I didn't say council I said there's more than one version"
1681.84,1688.8, So what I mean is that is the story is not finished yet completely with the first version of the game
1688.8,1691.8," In fact, it's designed to be a trilogy, but"
1692.8,1698.9399999999998, What happens in terms of whether the question the big questions will we start working on crisis to right away and
1699.52,1704.6799999999998, The answer to that is it really depends on how much requests it for that not from public side
1704.9599999999998,1710.1999999999998, But from the fan side mainly how does it do a business wise and also
1710.72,1716.8400000000001, I think the most important potentially how does a team feel about jumping right away into sequel
1717.16,1723.52, See this way our studio is pretty young still we just finished a vista. I mean we worked without research
1723.52,1727.88, 2001 if finished thousand folk fuck right they could have done fucker two
1728.3600000000001,1731.4, But in my mind and my two brothers mind
1732.2,1737.28, Effectively as this was three yearly brothers we said we just established a culture who drive for
1737.8,1740.0," Innovation and innovation innovation, you know"
1741.1200000000001,1747.04, And after fucker was said because there was a lot of people who think who thought hey we could do fucker to like this
1747.24,1751.24, You know like nothing like it's so we learned so much we can do it
1752.32,1759.88, Extremely fast and I was afraid of that mood in the company because I thought that mood is counterproductive right now
1759.88,1762.3600000000001, If we look at it as a sequel the right away
1762.88,1767.44, Then we might lose me may lose the edge we had you know the as a culture
1767.6000000000001,1773.3200000000002, We just developed the culture which we needed the manifest and so we said we could you have called crisis far cry to you though
1773.3200000000002,1775.48, I mean that stretch in this in the sense no
1775.48,1777.6000000000001," No, no, no, no, completely no because because we said"
1777.6000000000001,1782.24, One means because fucker to wood have done this crime June one it just would have continued
1782.8,1785.68, But for crisis we said the guys we were gonna make a new IP
1785.68,1792.0800000000002, There was like I've got a company meeting we have decided who make a new IP new engine new everything
1792.0800000000002,1793.28, You know
1793.28,1795.28, I would everybody was like what?
1796.04,1801.3999999999999, So much time when working the new engine right in the engine and finishing quite a fuck that we should leverage on it
1801.3999999999999,1803.8, Why that determination to do your own engine?
1804.32,1805.84," Well, this is a quote"
1805.84,1811.3999999999999, I for me it's just a matter of controlling fate in the company like I don't want to rely to anybody else
1811.8,1817.36, At the core of our game for sex as a bottle because it's it inherent drafts gameplay and
1817.84,1821.52, That should be in our hands. Is there any kind of a regional thing there too?
1821.52,1826.44, I mean because something I want also wanted to ask you about is about the German market and your fans there and
1827.44,1835.08, And how I'm sure like you'll see that there's a sense of a pride involved that you know that the game is coming from a studio that's based in in Germany
1835.92,1839.96, And also is it another way of kind of like saying like yeah all all
1840.08,1845.48," You know, Premier engines don't do not have to come from you know the same two or three locations"
1845.48,1850.76," Yeah, but there was not a motivation for we didn't this was not even in the summer close to the mind"
1850.76,1852.76, My mind
1852.76,1854.76, In my mind
1854.76,1858.52, But to come back a bit again to the topic because
1859.16,1865.74, For me crisis was about the development of crisis for me was about establishing a culture that stripes for innovation and
1866.28,1872.92, pushes the boundaries and to we had this culture developed and I want to manifest it in 12 studio
1873.64,1875.24, After crisis now
1875.32,1880.6, This team has been pushed two times effectively with working new IPs new technologies now
1880.6,1886.6, We have a culture that exists as a company and for me more forming the company is more important than making the games
1886.76,1891.4, So in theory now you think you could so you could go on to a crisis too
1891.4,1894.04," Yes, and feel that you've now pushed yourselves enough"
1894.2,1901.16," Yes, without losing the edge at terms of without losing the culture of trying and because if you would have entered a sick or right away"
1901.72,1909.0800000000002," It would have been okay, we were not just new IP, but now we also sequel and I wanted to make a crytic and IP creator"
1909.8000000000002,1911.8000000000002, as a primary goal and
1912.68,1914.68, And even if you do the sequel now
1914.68,1918.8400000000001, We would make sure it has enough innovation that is actually not just to continue the story
1919.0,1925.24, But actually has truly core gameplay innovations in itself and technical innovations as we used to
1925.3200000000002,1929.96, So it has to straight through to our culture and what consumers and our gamers fans
1930.2,1934.52, Happened to learn by now. I mean when they play now crisis after fuck fry
1935.0,1938.2, They'll be two times received games which pushed them and
1939.0,1944.3600000000001, In terms of quality in terms of perception of gameplay in terms of their mindsets like they have to think before the shoot
1944.68,1947.0, That's not a stupid truth. It's an intelligent shooter and
1948.1200000000001,1951.0, Once they get used to that they will expect this to follow
1952.1200000000001,1955.64, And so for me that's now the opportunity where we can follow it
1956.1200000000001,1961.3200000000002, Effectively as as a culture to to to to to serve to set purpose and so
1962.8400000000001,1970.76, That means the crisis too is much right now is much more likely than fuck fry two elbows unlike it say though
1970.76,1974.44, Where they you know retained Wolfenstein doom and quake and then
1974.92,1979.72, Went back and forth on them. I mean you you sold far Crystals just wondering if you were thinking it maybe
1979.96,1985.5600000000002, There wasn't enough distinct that the scenario is everything in in that world that you created weren't
1985.72,1989.16, Stinked enough to merit maintaining in retaining
1989.72,1996.44," You know, I mean you go on and you all these other things. No, we need it to financial we need we want to increase our independence"
1997.16,1999.72, and control creative control so we had to
2000.5200000000002,2005.5600000000002, Essentially create a financial background and the only way was to sell the baby one and
2006.6000000000001,2008.6000000000001," Yeah, make a new baby"
2008.6000000000001,2013.24," Is it still is it still hard to you to have lost that baby then yeah, of course"
2015.72,2017.64," Visitation rights occasionally. Yeah, we got it"
2018.3600000000001,2024.3600000000001, But you you may have done the day at the time you sold it you knew that they were gonna make a of course a fuck
2024.3600000000001,2031.48," Yeah, of course and and all the Xbox ones the instincts and right so so how do you feel about those?"
2031.48,2036.92, I mean do you or as much as you want to get into or or the thought of a far Cry 2?
2036.92,2041.96," Yeah, I have you specifically far Cry 2. I mean if you looked at it you were it was you were just a games convention"
2041.96,2045.5600000000002," Yeah, but I was there for four hours and I had to be a big slow fist right away"
2045.72,2047.88, So I didn't see anything. I'm fortunate. I saw
2049.08,2056.44, screenshots and I read the reviews on some magazines and I found a very interesting actually the fun thing is it's very interesting
2056.52,2060.04, Because we had conceptual draws for the factory franchise
2060.36,2064.76, Which were a bit similar but they were entire Africa scene and the scenario of Africa
2064.76,2074.2000000000003," I found it's an interesting take on the outer scenario. Yeah, so I did it and I'm happy that they don't follow the instinct powers because I felt they were a bit"
2075.16,2078.3599999999997, Egy I'm sad that they dropped Jack Harrow
2078.7599999999998,2082.2799999999997, Jack Harrow was funny. I found it cool the red shirt is cool and
2083.72,2085.96, We you know how long it took to pick the red shirt
2087.72,2089.08, It was really funny
2089.08,2092.7599999999998, But pick up the red shirt when you're also doing in Hawaii and wherever else
2092.7599999999998,2096.68," Yeah, you're in reference shoes the point of the red shirt was really interesting"
2096.68,2098.68, I just saw the story of the
2098.7599999999998,2104.9199999999996, We we had at one point like a draft of Hawaii Hawaii in shirts and people said we should take green
2104.9199999999996,2106.9199999999996, It's camouflage. It's not or no
2107.48,2111.72," It should be the opposite should be actually really like the contrast to the scenario, you know"
2112.2799999999997,2117.72," Is that where the whole frozen jungle thing was born? Yeah, the red shirt in the jungle ice next"
2117.72,2122.2799999999997, I tried to frozen the environment or actually wouldn't work there would be but I would have to be the yellow on us
2122.36,2124.28," It's not yellow. Yeah, it's actually not"
2125.6400000000003,2127.6400000000003, I know I see
2127.6400000000003,2129.6400000000003, I know
2130.0400000000004,2132.0400000000004, Let's not start that yeah
2132.6800000000003,2134.0400000000004," Okay, so about the blinding"
2136.0400000000004,2138.0400000000004, Blancet
2138.0400000000004,2145.0800000000004," Yeah, the shirt was a fun story but about emotions regarding fact to I mean I'm gonna look at it always"
2145.0800000000004,2147.0800000000004, The special for me
2147.6400000000003,2149.6400000000003, What's we will compete with it effectively
2150.6,2157.0, For me it's still not like the other competitions in the sense so it's different. I'm looking at different
2157.56,2160.04, And I really hope they will pull it off great
2160.6,2163.56, Just for that matter. I wish I will play fucker to as a wall
2164.04,2168.2799999999997, Because one thing I said after finishing fucker and after finishing craze I will say it again
2169.3199999999997,2171.64, One of the most difficult things is if you
2172.3599999999997,2176.44, And know that people want to scheme in the game is really an asserting quality bar
2177.4,2184.52, For you it's extremely difficult to experience that game as any fun and so one of the big dilemmas of a developer always is
2184.84,2187.48," That you will never have fun with your own games, right?"
2187.64,2188.84, So
2188.84,2195.0, And fucker two would be a really interesting thing for me because I didn't at fun with fucker playing it afterwards
2195.56,2198.44," Actually, I had fun after one year later when I played it again"
2199.0,2205.64, Because I forgot myself quite a few things in fuck fire and so I played it again as I am really funny
2206.52,2213.2400000000002, So in fucker two we were interesting to look at and to explain did you go on message boards to see you know what people are saying now that you be so free
2213.2400000000002,2216.6," Re-released is a free game, but with ad you know ads inside of it"
2217.32,2219.96, Just to see I mean you still care what people say about it or
2219.96,2223.64," No, I really chance to see I suppose to reason right just for you"
2223.64,2225.64, I mean really I might I've
2226.28,2227.96, Like from the auto world of
2227.96,2231.64, Critec like what happens around Critec at this last couple of weeks
2231.64,2233.16, I didn't right
2233.64,2239.64, I couldn't concentrate on because of the fact that we are every day working like crazy monkeys right now
2240.2,2242.68, Could would you be making crisis?
2242.68,2248.68, You know the game that it is now piece-yomely game with a dex 10 support if not for
2249.24,2251.8799999999997, The existence of the European especially the German market
2253.64,2257.16, So that's to say would you if say your European market didn't even exist?
2257.48,2261.7999999999997, Would you still be making this game you're making now in the way that you're making it and for you know
2261.88,2267.96," That's the thing we didn't really care of markets. Yeah, we just refer to the main finding and yeah, we had"
2267.96,2272.1200000000003, We said we had the back now just to let's do what we want to do and that was it
2272.1200000000003,2278.6800000000003, There was there was no market research analysis what's so why was the the PC thing why that we need to make it this PC game?
2278.92,2281.96," Well, they're two things anybody else was jumping in the consoles"
2282.6800000000003,2289.1600000000003, Like our competitions and we said look the market by no means we fall that fast that anybody can go and they we know market left
2289.64,2295.08, So they all perceive the products leave the market does degrade for the offline games
2295.64,2302.2799999999997, But not as fast as the products leaving the market so I said I saw very simple packed my decision
2302.8399999999997,2304.68, If we focus on
2304.68,2307.96, X-pean longhorn back then we still know
2308.8399999999997,2310.8399999999997, If we focus on that market and
2311.3999999999996,2313.3999999999996, Really tied no partnerships and
2313.7200000000003,2322.2000000000003, Focus on making the best PC game we can have a substantially higher market on that if you want like if you want the reason why focusing on them
2322.2000000000003,2327.64, But there was the the consequence how how we could win but the game designed self
2328.36,2333.4, Was the platform was a market choice for us and also just leading by our experience
2333.4,2336.28, Hine graphics so we can push it it's a opportunity
2336.76,2338.36, Partnerships opportunities
2338.36,2340.36, Competitive living opportunity
2340.36,2342.6800000000003, You know not a sign that we live should live to
2343.48,2347.96, What rather not like a little plead pin going the gems and we jump also
2348.44,2351.48," But rather let them jump we have more space for ourselves, no?"
2352.04,2354.04, So that was analogy and
2354.04,2359.3999999999996, Then we said let what do we do what kind of game and then we said I mean
2360.2799999999997,2363.08, We decision was not after finishing factory
2363.48,2370.8399999999997, This decision was somewhere in the middle of 2003 before finishing factory and we said that in the future will understand and
2371.08,2372.1200000000003, PC
2372.1200000000003,2377.7200000000003, So we always worked on the consoles testing things. I mean we tested game group it has PS2
2378.2000000000003,2382.1200000000003, We had a polybomb on all mapping technology and running a case to be sure that Sony
2382.36,2384.2000000000003, Nobody else has in the world even today
2384.52,2388.44, But we had our the normal mapping technology running we had running on games
2388.44,2391.6400000000003, Is that the equivalent of like normal mapping on a PS2 then like true?
2391.96,2393.7200000000003," Yeah, truly normal mapping we had this"
2393.7200000000003,2397.1600000000003, Backholder point lights everything we until using we had the running on PS2
2397.6400000000003,2400.36, But just a just a straight tech test
2400.52,2403.2400000000002," Yeah, just to see if we were to own PS2 how we would"
2404.1200000000003,2406.1200000000003, Push this platform and
2406.76,2411.6400000000003, And we want to challenge ourselves we did it after eight months we had a versus us it was really awesome
2412.2000000000003,2417.4, But we realized also we could never have portfacry to PS2 it's impossible even
2417.8,2420.76, But we would have to make a new IP and we were almost actually doing it
2421.48,2426.92, But we said last minute if said no no PC guys PC and we constantly research
2427.2400000000002,2430.44, PS3 is 360 Nintendo we are seeing there
2430.6800000000003,2434.44, Nintendo we not at the much but we always research those platforms
2434.92,2438.44, But the company culture is clearly PC driven and
2439.2400000000002,2442.76, Will stay like this even in the future second bet on it
2442.76,2447.16, We were talking before we hit record on this about you know how you can use a controller for
2447.7200000000003,2448.7200000000003, multiplayer
2448.7200000000003,2450.7200000000003," Yeah, you can"
2450.7200000000003,2455.7200000000003," And like yeah, this is here about that. I mean, yeah, it's like it's clearly a point of entry for some people that you know"
2455.72,2461.9599999999996, Might be afraid it or just not used to using a mouse for imagine just imagine scenario just imagine scenario in
2462.52,2464.52, Let's say one year from now
2464.52,2466.52, You have this really
2467.24,2474.68," This monitor which is 30 inch and place a 2005 phone by whatever solution okay, I think to the 25 by 600 something"
2476.4399999999996,2480.04, And you would up crisis at that resolution is anti-allizing
2480.2799999999997,2484.2, Going on and the new graphic cartridge you just bought whatever the NV next
2484.68,2486.68, Maybe 100 by that
2486.68,2490.84, The GT maybe G for 9000 and I don't know what become up one year
2491.24,2494.2799999999997, But probably and I'll get in trouble. I was in media for that
2494.44,2499.72, But the problem is the point is that imagine this new graphic card comes out and you have your
2501.0,2505.72, Lead console title as a shooter friend who just played this in a console
2506.52,2509.88, Best best shooter on the console and you tell him here
2509.88,2516.84, Take the 360 controller on this time and play it he will get an experience that no other platform can give you even today
2516.84,2523.96, He can he will let you said so that's for me one of the reasons why we were actually interested in moving on the controller
2524.2000000000003,2526.04, So the showcase
2526.04,2530.36, Experiences that are not possible on consoles. I think that's a good strategy
2530.36,2537.48," You know, I can't knock it just for the fact that I was I was first a console gamer and as I graduated to being a PC gamer"
2537.56,2539.56, It was
2539.56,2541.56, I'm gonna get you trouble for that
2541.56,2543.56, He graduated to be a secret
2543.56,2548.52," It was with you know, it was with the dreamcast at first because it let me use a mouse and and keyboard"
2548.52,2557.64, But then for the longest time when I got a PC I actually played you know how the original half-life with a controller and one end for the analog and then a mouse in the other so well
2557.64,2559.64, Wow
2559.64,2561.64, And with the but it was like it took a while
2561.72,2567.16, And then I got off of that and I weed myself off of that and I learned to use the keys and then now you know
2567.16,2571.4," I'm not wearing you know, so I can say if you can get someone in the door by saying yeah"
2571.4,2577.7999999999997," You have an interface that you're comfortable with yeah, and by the time that someone gets a PC that's able to run the crisis"
2577.7999999999997,2582.2," You know, I'm assuming they're in the the perfect position did sort of act"
2582.2,2585.48," If you're not using the other interface, you know over time"
2586.2799999999997,2590.8399999999997, But but you said you can use both in multiplayer and that that just seemed you know nursing to me because
2591.4,2597.56, Without you know serious bouncing tweaks or like if you have a controller peer server or something
2597.56,2601.56," Yeah, that's just gonna be a mess. But that's set up for that's a setup. Okay, so you can say"
2602.28,2604.92, Find me a server that you support nothing but
2605.48,2607.48, There's other side it can they can set up
2608.2000000000003,2610.52, All kind of variables to make sure that it's like only
2612.52,2618.52, Like a joypad do you think that's pretty easy to like cheat or something because you know I've always wondered on console why they don't support
2619.48,2625.64, I mean there's a there many reasons involved but one of the chief reasons that we hear for why you can't plug
2625.64,2631.36, You know into the existing ports on your 360 or something a mouse and keyboard is that we don't want to
2632.04,2635.8," Distribute playing feel like this and say well, why don't you make a peer based server thing?"
2635.8,2640.04, I mean is it easy to circumvent that or you think that's more of an excuse for
2640.68,2643.6, For other other reasons in fact in our case
2643.68,2649.44, Service if they're controller based against they're still say controller and keyboard allow it's it's completely flexible
2651.7599999999998,2657.36, Honestly I think it's a matter of market like I think that they assume on the consoles
2657.36,2662.48, There will be very few people playing with keyboard and mouse and NPC the assumptions
2662.48,2664.48, There will be very few people playing with controller
2664.7999999999997,2668.7999999999997, So that alone just makes the business value of that zero
2669.6,2671.6, For many developers for us it's really
2672.56,2678.64, To be honest I would never recommend playing crisis policy struggle is a controller. You know it's a PC title
2678.64,2687.2799999999997, It's like a policy struggle is fast and I mean very fast and it needs a proper and quick reactions
2688.0,2692.88, So it needs a proper UI which is already established set for for future
2693.36,2697.7599999999998, But for the single-platx brains for people who come from the console
2698.4,2701.44, They're super invited to play it I think they will have fun with it
2702.32,2704.32, But I'm not a console game a per se
2705.1200000000003,2707.44, myself I know that people actually play tested
2708.1600000000003,2714.4, multiplayer both internet and policy controller and they had fun was there visit a likes to play that fun
2714.4,2718.48, I'm sure they they play feel would be disturbed if the interface is mixed of course
2718.88,2724.8, There's natural because you somebody will place even with an inherent balance system like with auto aiming support
2724.88,2730.1600000000003, What not somebody who plays in a mouse and keyboard will always kill somebody who plays
2730.8,2732.8, with a controller yeah
2732.8,2735.36, Conceptually when I play the multiplayer the power stuff
2735.36,2739.28, One thing so I would like to add is the controller has our benefits in
2739.92,2745.52, Like steering vehicles and all the aspects like a particular when it comes to vehicles there is some benefit in the controls
2746.0800000000004,2751.84," Yeah, and as we are everyone that plays battlefield knows they're all really good for flying helicopters and yeah in some cases"
2752.32,2759.1200000000003, So there's some something some cases where it kind of if you're dedicated to that kind of playing style
2759.6800000000003,2765.04, Or preferred is kind of playing style you may choose a controller as a preference or having both plugged in and when you get never
2765.04,2767.04, Grab pick up the controller
2767.6000000000004,2769.6000000000004, So one thing of a sense is that you know
2770.08,2774.32," I've had limited experience with power struggle beta, but conceptually"
2774.88,2778.56, I'm super impressed with it. I love I mean you go in you've got tactical nugs you've got you know
2778.56,2780.56, I've used you know the various
2780.88,2786.96," Ice weapons the heavy prototype tank and stuff all this is awesome, but the one impediment I was having"
2787.52,2790.32, Is the kind you'd expect in the beta and that's just performance stuff
2790.72,2794.96," And you say that you know of course you're optimizing it, but outside of you know specific"
2794.96,2799.84," You know, I don't want to like you know having kind of like beta beta questions or tell give you my list of beta functions now"
2799.84,2802.7999999999997, But since you're making a game that is so cutting edge
2803.44,2809.6, You've got like this kind of like reverse scale when you have multiplayer people start to prize performance more than anything
2809.7599999999998,2813.04," I know it's a look good, but you also if you're going to play well"
2813.36,2816.96," You start you get to the point where you're like okay, I could maybe if that crab"
2816.96,2821.12, That comes up out of the water looks like a box. It's fine as long as I can hit this guy in the head
2821.12,2823.12, It's been like kill me
2823.12,2826.0, I believe I believe that a great gameplay and
2826.88,2829.7599999999998, An upgrade in visuals the finance the way
2830.48,2832.48, Into the future so
2832.48,2836.4, For me the most important most plemo we have is pause struggling the extent and
2837.04,2839.92, I'm sure there will be only hundreds of players playing at the beginning
2840.48,2845.76," Not in the night. I mean hundreds a bit like exaggerated, but I believe there will be a slow adaptation"
2846.32,2851.36," I hope it will be big of course, but we count on pause throughout the extent to actually"
2852.08,2855.92, Pantrate into the multiplayer gaming scene over the course of the next year
2856.56,2859.28, But we want to introduce a deaccent multiplayer
2859.84,2865.36, You know like this was we we just say it's first movie will be punished for it because it's a high-high end burden
2865.52,2871.2000000000003," But we wanted to take this step now not in one year not in two years, but now to to level out the play field. I mean"
2872.2400000000002,2876.4," If we were to launch a multiplayer only game today for example, look at this scenario"
2877.2000000000003,2879.6, We cannot afford to cut off the minspecks
2880.0,2882.4, Saying this deaccent only we can't do that
2882.8,2887.52, But we do it because we have in crisis we have pause struggle which has deaccent nine
2887.76,2890.56, We have instant action and we have single player crisis
2890.88,2892.64, There's enough substance already for that
2892.7999999999997,2899.7599999999998, So we said let's give this feature element of the multiplayer gaming already into the package and let's support it and
2900.16,2903.2799999999997, Wait like make sure the game plays refined so deaccent nine
2903.92,2905.6, But let's have it there
2905.6,2906.96, it would eventually
2906.96,2908.16, be
2908.16,2912.48, Pantrating or not pangering and how you say it will be adopted by the different
2913.2799999999997,2914.7999999999997, gamers as the
2914.7999999999997,2915.7599999999998, months is
2915.7599999999998,2917.84, Pass by that's what I'm truly believing it
2918.6400000000003,2922.7200000000003, It is what I believe also like the ps3 look to add the
2923.6000000000004,2927.52, Consumacri right now. I eventually believe ps3 will be still leading
2928.1600000000003,2930.7200000000003, But it takes its time because the adaptation rate is
2931.44,2932.7200000000003, due to different reasons so
2932.7200000000003,2934.6400000000003, But the adaptation rate is
2935.1200000000003,2939.44, Slowly but it's getting there and I think pause struggle the extent will be similar
2939.44,2944.6400000000003, Pause struggle the extent nine which you're testing right now has performance issues through beta reasons
2944.72,2946.64, But also through
2946.64,2952.7999999999997, Optimization in the like in the rendering but also in the gameplay codes still you're pretty confident that there's will be ironed out
2952.7999999999997,2957.3599999999997," Well, we will of course okay, I mean we will do our best to make performance always on"
2958.4,2963.68, Topic but let's not forget again crisis high-entidal and will live primary from single player
2964.16,2966.16, But the gameplay of a multiplayer
2966.7999999999997,2971.92, For us was important from the concept point of view that it works that the network technologies really absolutely optimized
2972.4,2975.2000000000003, But the was that the graphics are demanding
2976.08,2980.7200000000003, It's clear right as long as see I was running it on an 8800 is a GTS
2981.2000000000003,2986.08, Granite but you know excellent ram everything else is pretty good what I certainly
2986.48,2989.76, Consider high end and a lot of other people are definitely going to consider high end as well
2989.76,2992.08, So as long as on a system like that
2992.2400000000002,2994.2400000000002, It's optimized to the point because then
2994.2400000000002,2998.96, But then if you get to the point where you're splitting hairs about when you say a future system and you don't mean well
2999.04,3003.28," Hey, so one can go to circuit city spent 3,000 bucks and they still aren't getting"
3004.0,3008.7200000000003, You know satisfactory performance out of it then that's when I think it would become a problem yeah
3008.7200000000003,3013.92," Yeah, I believe that the 880 at 100 GTS will play the game somewhere between mid and high"
3014.08,3020.16, Configuration but very high you will need something more yeah for multiplayer but then again for very high for the extent
3020.48,3023.28, Through on a search to match with this next generation of gameplay
3023.6,3027.36, You will need an SLI config or something like this but principally
3028.0,3030.0, I don't want to
3030.0,3032.4, Like did one thing I want to mention is that
3033.6,3039.44, Whilst you're some people are gonna pick up the frame it as an issue on policy or particularly because it really did my system
3041.76,3045.2000000000003, The fact people should never forget the fact that we had a huge single player
3045.76,3048.1600000000003, We have a whole month play game in the package too
3048.7200000000003,3053.92, Which is like a usually stand alone packet itself and we're gonna release all the edit itself
3054.0,3059.76, So we have a from substance of I will vouch for that on a conceptual level and on the way that everything's coming together
3060.0,3064.92, Power struggle alone is as much of a game as like you know battlefield or Quake Wars or something like that which
3064.92,3068.0, So what I'm saying is that while its performance it might be an issue
3068.96,3074.56, I think anybody who buys crisis ultimately should have has to look at it as a
3075.6,3080.8, The fact that the substance is big you know they get affected two games and a whole development tool
3081.28,3084.1600000000003, Alongside with it for the price of one game and
3085.36,3091.36, For me and plus the fact that we invest in the future they get also the future taste of multiplayer how it will be
3091.84,3096.0, Other games you will see other multiple games so migrate to the extent maybe in a two years not now
3096.5600000000004,3102.84, So the adaptation to the extent gameplay not through the extent API gains but the performance
3103.8,3112.0, Gains what the extent generation will bring in the future that game play it's already included and we will see other developers adopting to it
3112.44,3120.96, Not visit next to years just because the fact it's actually a pretty harsh cut and we took it for the sake of the gaming future of PC
3121.36,3123.6800000000003, This is the question. I think applies to what you're doing
3124.08,3128.88," Have you you familiar to game call a warriors came out of Poland? Yes, I actually like the game"
3128.96,3134.52, In the multiplayer there's an option to use the depth of field feature if you have enough hardware you're able to run it
3135.4,3141.6400000000003," Similarly, you know you have motion blur in crisis with the thing there though is that because you have an open system and people with you know"
3141.84,3149.1600000000003, Min specs aren't even able to run it with that the field but I think I found that in the gameplay by playing the game with it on and off
3149.28,3153.12, You're better served with it being off from a up here
3154.6800000000003,3157.6, advantage level of being able to see your environment
3157.6,3163.08," Whenever it might be more immersive or realistic to have it on in the same way as motion blur, but when it gets too heavy"
3163.6,3166.44, It's almost like if you're playing to win you're gonna turn those things off
3166.44,3170.22, So I was wondering like if in a general thinking in the future of of
3171.4,3177.04," I mean, yeah, but do you see that as being an impediment ultimately until you at least on a on a open platform like"
3179.04,3184.08, I think that if you look at it if you look at the next gen gameplay interesting with the dexten
3184.88,3188.7599999999998," We have the night circles we have to physics gameplay break up with it, et cetera"
3188.96,3193.24, We use the extent effectively to gain performance and what it gains performance and
3193.96,3200.04, We essentially use the system capacity is more so that this because we assume somebody who runs
3200.88,3204.16," 800 also has a certain CPU capacity, right?"
3204.16,3208.12, So you can go to very high if you can do that we
3208.88,3212.2, automatically use a system to compress data more and it's on the network
3212.2799999999997,3217.56, So we can play on the net vector effect more so we can effectively
3217.56,3219.08, Pop-play the game more rich and
3219.88,3224.08, Vazir somebody can turn off the futures if I would say if they don't
3225.2,3227.2, Change gameplay
3227.2,3232.3599999999997," Like for example, my nephew who's playing multiple power struggle beta"
3232.52,3234.52, Here's 8800 ultra
3234.7599999999998,3237.4, But the way you place it is at the low configuration
3238.2,3243.16," I say one don't need to turn on the future. It says well, I'm playing the win, you know, I want high frame it"
3243.88,3246.3599999999997, same as when I played the first time quicks for arena
3246.6,3248.6, What did I do?
3248.6,3253.0, The texture is almost off actually as much as we can in order to get to high frame it
3253.0,3260.2," So but at the same time I said, you know what I'm a more like a visual perist so I want to see the graphics of that"
3260.52,3266.04, So I enabled all the the highest resolution and the highest configuration I could get but the price is frame it
3266.2799999999997,3270.44, So I think that the multiplayer that the gameplay is more important
3271.08,3278.52," It's granted. It sounds like you need it also another server that like limits people playing on a like, you know like if you want a server"
3278.7599999999998,3282.44, Where people agree to all use motion blur and depth of field
3282.44,3288.92, But motion blur depth is a is a topic which I think in the beta our motion blur was too much happening right
3288.92,3292.44, That was one of the reasons why people have been angry. It's already addressed in fact
3292.84,3295.8, They're bringing it up and some community members brought up already
3296.36,3299.64," Yeah, but very intense, yeah, but a principle thing is"
3300.36,3305.8, One of the reasons why the accent actually has multiple impact in a gameplay impact in multiplayer
3307.16,3314.92, Is because gameplay is more important in multiplayer gameplay benefits is more of a reason why to migrate to new generation
3315.88,3321.08, of a platform and gameplay is more important in anything and multiplayer than
3321.56,3327.08," Devisual feast, but I believe still like there people who are jumping from"
3327.56,3333.72, Counterstrike to other games stuff step by step because at one point the visual just doesn't cut it anymore
3334.2799999999997,3338.7599999999998, Why did we see a Counterstrike update because the visuals doesn't cut anymore to
3339.3199999999997,3346.6, Compared to other games and the customer who sees a game high end game and then she sees the Counterstrike says why does Counterstrike one
3347.24,3354.36, Granted look so bad so they needed to be an upgrade even after the upgrade what if you see the migration doesn't happen that fast
3354.36,3356.36, to people prefer original
3356.6,3358.6, Because it just runs fast and the gameplay is
3359.72,3367.08, Iron right so I think pause struggle and the next one year to three years after that will become
3367.08,3371.3199999999997," Completely in the topic. It's a high end demanding, but gameplay will be refined as we go and"
3371.96,3375.7999999999997, We will nail the gameplay to perfect balance in the hardware look at you eventually
3376.6,3381.08, And that's where I'm wasting that pause struggle wins it's conceptually conceptually
3381.72,3386.2, We tested it for the last 12 months and we refined it actually quite drastically and
3388.2,3393.3199999999997," We think it has all ingredients to be number one title, but takes time to get there essentially"
3393.72,3394.7599999999998, So right out of the box
3395.56,3398.7599999999998, You would have to probably turn down the visuals if you want to kill
3399.3199999999997,3405.96, But if you want a average out of experience with your friends like where everybody plays the high setting you can have a great experience
3407.4,3409.4, Cool you guys
3409.7999999999997,3414.7599999999998, Been chatting for a while you guys have any any questions actually you hit my questions. I was gonna ask so how we doing
3416.04,3420.44, How we doing on time we been hammering for an hour really wow
3421.48,3426.04, By one because I asked so many it's on that's a long time you're not how your answers are awesome
3428.36,3433.3199999999997, Do you I'm wondering about if there is a difference in
3434.28,3441.1600000000003, Either gaming expectations or even play styles amongst that you've seen or experienced amongst
3441.96,3450.2000000000003, European gamers versus American gamers say like are they are they not as a way to start any kind of culture war here
3450.2000000000003,3454.6000000000004, I'm just curious like if if German or French or or
3455.2400000000002,3460.92, English gamers or anyone over there Eastern European PC gamers we're the connection of anything is PC players
3461.32,3466.52, I would say with I mean we probably have as hardcore in American hardcore PC player
3466.52,3472.92, I would guess we have a good deal as at least as much in common with you know another hardcore German or or
3473.08,3479.08, Swedish or or Finn PC player as we do between like say Joe console in America and
3479.64,3486.12, Super tech this is what amassing like are we all the same or do you perceive differences? I mean like in your experience with far cry
3486.12,3490.04, Say or maybe the kind of questions you're getting on the forums about crisis or
3490.44,3495.16, Is there just nothing that you that stands out to you interesting?
3496.36,3504.04, Well the culture difference is the only thing what we saw was the usually American audience usually
3504.6,3512.2799999999997, Pay some attention to the visual to tell and the European audience you should tend to look at the gameplay as a primary reason
3513.32,3519.08, more superficial yeah a little bit more I mean that that's I mean that's the the if you
3520.2,3525.64, The surface like Americans look Europe always like a most sophisticated by its culture. I mean already and
3526.12,3530.12, The Europeans always look at Americans for each other superficial being
3530.52,3535.0, professional and being too much so yeah superficial actually well we are and so
3536.2,3541.88, I assume we actually I'm not gonna go there talk about a specific video and I asked
3542.6,3547.72, Box opening yeah maybe you should talk about whatever this is sorry it's it's I dead
3548.68,3549.8799999999997, But
3549.8799999999997,3552.68, Principally to minimize the superficial you know
3553.16,3558.68, principally I believe the gamers so they don't like the part of the lead came out the answer was talking before
3559.08,3564.52, They don't differentiate you know they want from everything they want the blonde was a PhD
3565.24,3570.6, What about just because I've heard you know from some European developers will say that
3570.9199999999996,3577.08, There's a lot more forgiveness for or that Americans expect a more streamlined and easier to use interface
3577.8799999999997,3583.48, Then some of the European audience it's gonna demand and then they'll use something like armed assault as an example
3583.48,3588.3599999999997, Which to people that are used to playing ghost recon and its Greeks and incarnations you know
3589.16,3595.48, Would just look at armed assault also called arma and say what the hell is going on here? I think
3596.2799999999997,3598.2799999999997, It's the UI
3598.68,3603.0, Designing a UI that is easy to enter is a general rule of design anyway
3603.64,3609.4, So if you if somebody designs a product saying you know our Europeans will get it
3609.8,3615.08, American market on care I think this is flawed by definition already have you seen people make that decision?
3615.08,3619.96," No, I so but what I'm saying is you it's you simply implied that some of"
3620.6,3627.0, Arma was done with his mind or not or they didn't care or they all go so you can talk more challenge in UI
3627.08,3630.68, So that they it's the game is accessible for the US market
3631.56,3637.96, There are probably some US market considerations here and there but for example during the open factory or during the open
3637.96,3641.72, Acrisis there were no considerations there's one thing so
3642.92,3644.92, Actually one topic which came up
3645.48,3648.12, Probably consequently all the time again was a monofgoer
3648.84,3653.64, That was one thing which was like basically told Americans like or
3654.6,3658.68, And Europeans don't you know and so that was then come
3659.96,3666.3599999999997, Constant topic and even within our studio with those American voices and European voices
3667.56,3673.4, The amount the call for a gore usually came from the American camps versus jackdome
3674.92,3677.96," Yeah, yeah, yeah, actually he's not with us anymore, but"
3678.44,3684.68," Oh, yeah, no, but American voices other like Chris Evans or some other guys we're asking for it"
3685.48,3687.48, But what online is
3689.08,3698.44," I think it's awesome, you know, I think you know the general general ask the general demand of core on on core is actually defined by our"
3699.4,3701.4, State of happiness generally
3702.12,3706.36," Like like in the movies the culture to me, yeah like as nations in fact"
3706.36,3710.84, So we're like our market that's where I'm happy. We're just definitely unhappy. I don't know what's happening here
3710.84,3712.44, I'm very good
3712.44,3714.44," Yeah, it's probably right"
3715.48,3721.8, I think there's some I mean the top typically in the movie industry the pick of them of a movie
3722.52,3726.6800000000003, Or the amount was that drama as entrant as a comedy so entrant usually
3727.2400000000002,3732.84, It's correlated to the economical state of the company of the country and usually the
3732.84,3740.1200000000003, The movies that like in the world war you had comedy mainly as a huge contrast to what's going on the world
3740.6800000000003,3745.56, So because people were depressed they had needed hope or science fiction movie actually
3745.56,3751.08, I was very critical about about the movie industry in the US right now that talked about
3751.6400000000003,3754.84, The movies that are out now in the movies that are coming out for the rest of the year that there's a
3755.96,3760.84, Great amount of very violent movies that that are prestige movies
3760.92,3764.52, You know some of the art movies even like this dirty foster brave one thing and
3765.2400000000002,3770.04, It's crazy. No country for old men coming out that and the analysis was saying that like
3770.6000000000004,3775.08, The that the country psyche here in the US is a little bit disturbed right now
3775.08,3781.08," Yeah, but it's that's from saying it might be only that reason really because for me for example the amount of gold"
3781.08,3785.2400000000002, What I see nowadays like I saw the trade of new rumble the new rumble
3786.1200000000003,3788.1200000000003, The amount of gold that movie trailer short
3789.08,3794.7599999999998, I was shocked by I mean more shocked and how old still on looked
3796.04,3801.56," That was the scariest part yeah, they were but okay, but the point is that I was shocked amount of go how much"
3801.56,3806.6, Goar was there and I think this must have must be related to the current state of America
3807.16,3811.56, Because but I can't explain what's happening obviously it's not
3812.2,3813.88, We never took a deliberate
3814.2000000000003,3818.52, On this but bottom line is that was the only
3819.48,3822.28, Same or discussion topic I remember now
3822.84,3824.84, Which came up and
3824.84,3827.96, That's actually you can't get out of it there because you're making a game that
3828.6,3834.36," Americans versus Koreans at least for part of it. Yeah, so you're clearly willing to comment on things yeah"
3835.08,3837.08, Let's
3838.52,3841.7200000000003, So you want me to comment on the fact that you're shooting no screens
3842.2,3848.04," No, just what I mean the fact you're making a game where you're reprint that has a representation of America in some respect"
3848.04,3855.7999999999997," However minor even if it it's you know, yeah, I know but you know what people are calling you should that the arm should tear off the the head should blow a blow off"
3855.7999999999997,3857.7999999999997, And you should have rocket launcher on them
3857.7999999999997,3862.04," The body should disemble this is ample. I said no, you know, it's not"
3863.0,3867.72, It's not tasty and as a game I think the
3867.72,3871.08, The the presentation of action has to be still done in a
3873.64,3877.8199999999997, Soft scared away but not over top is a amount of goro or blood
3878.4399999999996,3886.7599999999998, Goron blood for me is always a matter as a cheap way to a punctuate action and when I say cheap cheap way
3887.8799999999997,3891.72, I mean it's simple to shock an audience by a monopler
3891.8799999999997,3895.9599999999996, But it's more difficult to shock and catch audience by a good representation
3896.44,3899.96, Some of the impersonation which is not for the shock by the
3901.16,3903.16, But by the action density
3903.16,3907.88, Maybe it's because it's easier to blow up and jibble characters than it is to have the ragdoll not look like
3907.88,3913.8," In fact, to be honest, I said technically it's simple technically it's always simpler to be honest to just have lots of gor"
3914.76,3918.92," Splatting blood. Yeah, I mean, how do you play team fortress two? No, okay?"
3918.92,3923.96, You said I want to play but I didn't at time I want to finish crisis as you know super abstracted
3924.44,3928.52," Very cartoon like if I was a strike or a yeah, if I would do abstract to be honest"
3928.52,3935.4, I would go for markedly well because of that that abstraction the good thing about gorish the good thing is about gor is that
3935.8,3940.6, It simplifies of course the communication of a hit you know you hit something boom
3941.16,3947.7200000000003," Yeah, it's a lot of blood so it's very clear from any distance whatsoever the hit reaction of sort of sophisticated"
3949.32,3953.32, I say so for scared because it needs more sophisticated like impulse physics and
3953.96,3957.88, Partial to not too much but subtle enough that you can recognize it's shooting ranges et cetera
3957.96,3962.2, So it takes much more work to make it still work. It's a cheap sell too though
3962.2,3964.44, I mean we have to admit it. I mean we'd look at the history games
3964.44,3969.2400000000002, We went mortal combat remember that era when when mortal combat first came out and there were games like time killers
3969.2400000000002,3975.8, And they were all about you know you chain soft someone's arm and even though they were just they look like complete crap by today standards at the time
3976.44,3979.96, You're like oh man did you see that and while I you know
3980.04,3983.64, There there are a number of reasons that it works like in gears of war because it it indicates
3985.08,3991.0," You know it's feedback you know, yes, you are shooting this guy and it's doing something in matters and also"
3991.0,3993.96," You know the shit talking factor of like ah, I just see what I did to you"
3994.12,3999.2400000000002, But at the same time I think that is still there on some levels as long as you update the presentation
3999.48,4001.8, There's at least a North American audience that does
4003.08,4009.32, Get something else from it. I'm not sure what the age group is or what but it's like it brings back for me like that mortal combat thing
4009.32,4012.84," Where it was a talking point about us the time us like what I was a high school, you know"
4014.84,4016.84, How do you a depression
4018.6800000000003,4023.1600000000003, Right laugh at it then this cheesy because most of us like street fighter more anyway. I didn't really you know
4023.48,4025.48," Yeah, but a little bit of blood again. I think"
4026.2000000000003,4029.4, The goal and games I have difficulty already
4029.8,4033.4, Them 40 a month of court to be honest. We have in crisis what about TNA
4034.36,4036.36, TNA
4036.92,4039.6400000000003, That's the American saying no
4039.6400000000003,4046.44, I'm not saying that you have short for sexual content or you and you and I know just you see this is one of the places
4046.44,4047.7200000000003, Which is interesting
4047.7200000000003,4049.7200000000003, Just general in games. This is one thing
4049.7200000000003,4055.48," Not coffee. Yeah, like sexual content in game versus the boring game to be honest. I would rather have sexual content than go"
4056.28,4058.52, This is why this is the European
4058.52,4060.52, This is exactly
4060.52,4063.72, I was going to say this again where Europe differences America
4064.7599999999998,4066.28, When we have visitors from US
4067.0,4069.0, to come to Europe to visit us
4069.32,4070.68, effectively
4070.68,4073.56, When they go to the hotel rooms and they just watch TV
4074.12,4078.7599999999998, To be the same dude you have fallen in if you don't know it's still port is this norm yeah
4079.32,4083.56, My wife is French and the first time I went over there and I was watching television with
4084.04,4090.2, With her and her parents my in laws and we're watching the six o'clock news and there's a soap commercial and you know
4090.2,4091.7999999999997, In our soap commercials
4091.7999999999997,4097.0, It's all just in you and though and just like different camera angles and that was just a new lady
4097.24,4099.24, Using soap
4099.24,4101.24, And I was just like
4101.24,4103.24, Wow
4103.24,4105.48, The best commercial ever the best soap on the head
4105.48,4108.5199999999995, You know the whole all the friends people in the room are just like what is your problem?
4108.5199999999995,4110.12, Have you not seen a naked person?
4110.12,4112.5199999999995, I bet you went out to bed just sort of way right here
4112.6,4114.6, I did yeah
4114.6,4118.120000000001, Please but you hear that you know it's sure you hear that all the time
4118.120000000001,4122.92," You know what is your what is the Americans hang up with so yeah, I mean the nudity that's thing"
4124.120000000001,4127.4800000000005, So like if you were to have sexual condolences think we would push that
4128.52,4130.84, Much more probably we'll get more trouble in US
4131.320000000001,4135.320000000001," Yeah, then they're the way around you would get your adults only rating if you had it look at"
4135.320000000001,4138.92," I think it's a classic examples, you know in the grant of dotto series where they had it"
4139.0,4143.64, There was called the hot coffee thing that that you can unlock it in it. I mean you already had a game
4143.96,4145.64, They consist of it
4145.64,4150.04," It didn't require you to shoot cop, but you see it in the hot-coffee shooting cops, but you see it"
4150.04,4154.76," I'm shooting people and everything else. Yeah, but then you get a blowjob you get your wing dang doodle"
4155.96,4162.28," Like you don't it bam. Yeah, it's it's time to go to the criminal. Yeah, but you see the hot-coffee"
4162.28,4167.18, One thing for GTA was no discussion in Germany. Did you know it was a no-
4167.26,4169.26, Not a care non-issue
4169.58,4172.22, But it's pretty you guys are more level-headed than us
4173.5,4175.5," It's very spiked if no, I mean I"
4175.740000000001,4179.18, Real estate sexual content is always you know sexual content is not
4180.62,4185.900000000001, It doesn't imply I mean the reason why I would prefer sexual condolences and I'm saying if I would choose
4185.900000000001,4188.14, And I would I want to be clear about this
4188.14,4193.66," I would rather choose a condolences score because for me, it's less sick to showcase what happens all"
4193.98,4200.7," Anyway, it's normal life versus blowing off people. You know, that doesn't happen and in reality"
4200.86,4207.5," But do anything somebody could then say okay, but you're you know, you just devoted your time to making a game in which it"
4207.5,4213.58, You're just shooting people you know somebody who's a get who's so you have a you yourself have a limit
4213.58,4216.78, We're of how much gore you can deal with and we all do too
4217.099999999999,4221.34, But there's gonna be other people you know older people or whatever who are gonna just look at any game
4221.42,4227.1," Where you're shooting someone to just say that's sick no, it's because we don't glorify the shooting experience at moment"
4227.1,4236.46, And the way we do it is we just say it's action of means it's a means to survive and it's a means to when the guy takes a piss on the dock and you shoot them in the back
4236.46,4238.46, You're glorifying
4238.46,4242.46," Well, and that that is that it was definitely put in there to glorify"
4242.9400000000005,4244.7, But you don't let me just make you laugh
4244.7,4249.74, It's not glorifying no glorifying would be if he pisses and I piss around and then piss it
4251.34,4258.3, You're a spins around at a control and at eat for you when I saw you when I saw that behavior the first thing was like
4258.46,4264.14," You you pulp your pistol, you know your your customization and you look if you have an electrical dart to shoot into the water"
4264.860000000001,4266.860000000001, I saidly I didn't have one
4267.82,4269.82, You gotta hope yeah
4270.62,4272.62," Yeah, but again"
4272.62,4275.26, This is where this is where it becomes
4276.54,4279.26, Interesting in terms of design where you say okay
4280.14,4285.74, We do shoot people but you should not you are not devoid of shooting the people you actually
4286.46,4290.46, Do you have objected for you have to do in the game and the oppressive say never kill everybody
4291.02,4297.34, You know the objective is not about shooting people it's about getting this the the whole experience of the crisis
4297.34,4302.780000000001, Which is the defining the the what going through the storyline. I want to I don't want to
4303.42,4309.34," Tell anyone sorry anymore. I want you to play the game, but principally if you go into the game"
4310.7,4313.259999999999, And your survival act starts where you get detected
4313.5,4317.82, It's the the the pistol detected you then the core game plays about shooting
4318.54,4325.179999999999, And even if you survived that aspect then we don't want to clarify that but surviving tech the self effect the self is
4325.9,4331.82, Already enough of a war speaking of spoilers like I think this says a lot about the nature of games and selling games
4332.0599999999995,4336.78, But I already know part I mean not just because you know I write about and visit your studio
4336.78,4342.0599999999995, But I already know in the world of enthusiasts you know that go to websites where you magazine
4342.0599999999995,4347.099999999999, It's knows about the interior of the alien structure. They know about the icing and all this stuff
4347.179999999999,4352.62, Now imagine like I always think back at the time the first time I saw alien right and no one told me about it
4352.62,4357.66, I don't know how it's because I was young and I didn't have the chance to hear everyone spoiled the chess bursting scene and
4357.9,4361.58, Everything is pretty internet right and when you go into it at the time you like
4362.299999999999,4366.7, I always wonder what did it blew my mind in the same way if I had everyone had warned me about it
4366.7,4374.38, But I mean is it but in in games even even the most carefully guarded you know games were where they're most carefully guarded and and
4374.94,4379.0199999999995, Traditionally they're the ones that have already proven themselves because they don't need to reveal
4379.0199999999995,4380.62, I say they don't need to strip down
4380.62,4383.179999999999, I get to get everyone interested yeah
4383.179999999999,4386.46, Because had to go through this process of a revelation here and there
4387.02,4393.66, Simply because they while the hype asked for it and the development times were long and and so
4394.22,4396.46, This was a kind of like a market demand effectively
4397.42,4400.86, But at the same time I would say crisis too if it would have happened
4401.58,4403.58, You wouldn't say anything from crescent for a long and time
4405.26,4411.02," In fact, I wish to be honest that I could say to you today look I have a cool game show"
4411.5,4413.5, It's called treasets first time ever
4413.82,4422.3, I would bet you impression be tenfold tired today then it is you're right like what if what if this game just came out and then all of a sudden it just hit and then
4423.34,4428.54, Or thing I next thing I know I mean just out of the blue you know in what you mentioned from now I'm playing crisis
4428.54,4431.66, Imagine just get that DVD sending as a review and say here please
4431.66,4435.02," You put that in yeah, I mean then there will be a"
4435.5,4439.42, Compact difference friends for you and probably will be the way we handle in future old all up
4439.9800000000005,4442.54, Because your publishers aren't gonna be happy with that they will be
4443.9800000000005,4449.1, That will be because we will make sure that we talk about in different ways without revealing
4450.46,4457.1," Talk about the specifics yeah, particularly one thing we will avoid for sure is and and you like how we already got you didn't make it"
4457.1,4459.1," SQL yeah, that I hate over"
4460.7,4462.7, We're still waiting for the car
4462.7,4465.74," Yeah, I look on them just get me drunk and now come over"
4467.26,4469.26," No, but"
4469.74,4472.14, The way games are market I wish
4473.02,4479.74, The developers could release the games without relying on the marketing or they hype around it surrounding it
4480.54,4487.18, But it takes a lot of efforts and time to make people aware of anything today because of the internet
4487.18,4490.38, The market is computer with many many hundreds of games and
4491.18,4495.26, To constant constantly remember and stand out and to be there
4495.9800000000005,4501.58, I would argue today there are games that are completely overlooked still completely and if you look at crisis
4502.780000000001,4510.9400000000005," It has been constantly in the top most wanted but we had stayed there, you know, so we had to create that hype and we can't show all its time"
4510.9400000000005,4516.3, Same content at same time it's sad because of course it has an impact on the first experience
4516.860000000001,4521.820000000001, So the people who never saw of crisis and they get it first time we had some people when the focus group tests
4522.46,4524.86, People which we said did you play shooters?
4524.86,4528.7," Yes, did you ever have a crisis now and we had them test"
4528.86,4534.139999999999, And they were completely different experience than people who actually knew everything are crescent and they played a set
4534.94,4537.099999999999, Their person who never played he was
4537.099999999999,4541.5," Literally said he was shocked, you know, he was completely shocked by the experience"
4541.74,4543.98, Because the other games the other game was like
4544.46,4546.7, Damn it's just plays like a sword
4547.259999999999,4549.74, I can't believe I'm playing the great-looking game now myself
4549.82,4552.46," You know, so it was the biggest industry"
4552.7,4557.34, We write different stories every month the point where we're now talking about the specific builds that we're playing
4558.0599999999995,4562.86, And every step of the way I wish we're now like you does I mean in the mass market
4562.86,4566.219999999999, I mean maybe there are maybe that those players are still there
4566.219999999999,4571.98, But it's like it's weird because we're among the enthusiasts it's like they're they have the blue prints to your house and not only that
4571.98,4576.86, Like if you're making a house for someone they're they're there every step of the way watching it commenting every time
4576.86,4578.86, You know one of that one of the guys
4578.94,4581.42," With uh, whatever it is the trial"
4581.98,4584.62, What's up and put the cigarette butt in the you know
4585.179999999999,4589.74, Inside this the order I believe also by the way the movie industry is gonna get to that point too
4589.98,4592.38, Every soon as well to catch it because it's the only way
4592.86,4595.66, Instamment can survive the customers are close entertainment
4595.98,4598.78, They're more part of development or they follow development more
4599.98,4605.66, In the games it's inherent in the case because the game's industry takes two just for years to help games
4605.9,4607.339999999999, And it takes a lot of money to yeah
4607.66,4615.900000000001, To recover and I and also it's a matter of risk management is the fact because like in a year when you showed the concept reveal and the people like what the fuck is that
4616.78,4621.26, You say we better stop though stopping the loving the game because it's not and I'm gonna sell
4621.82,4627.1, So it's I mean you don't test it usually by PR but you tested usually by focus groups before that anyway
4627.42,4633.900000000001, But some companies may use as a gauge of and maybe should be designed our change of designs maybe should maybe make another game or
4634.219999999999,4638.94, Maybe you should emphasize this aspect which people liked really and this didn't but should maybe
4638.94,4642.46, Do design the game completely so it gives up on you and so react on
4643.0199999999995,4647.82, Defeat back on on a bigger scale rather than on a small test like shows folks
4647.82,4649.82, I'm like E3 for us
4649.82,4654.86, Was a great way to see how are the people now and how much bigger scale reacting to this
4655.179999999999,4659.42, Where does he the first time I can have how did they react it they were amazing
4659.82,4661.82, positive and
4661.82,4666.38," But you didn't get the the graphics award the beauty show price no, I mean the year before"
4666.86,4674.139999999999," So what about this year though like this year? Well, I didn't even go to you forgot get the well"
4674.139999999999,4675.5, I was disappointed to be honest
4676.139999999999,4681.259999999999, Not for myself but for the team because they really put a lot of force and blood and sweat and tears into it
4682.46,4683.66, And
4683.66,4687.259999999999, I think that your game was the best looking for graphics again. This is yeah
4687.34,4692.860000000001, I mean I don't understand why I mean you can argue today anybody who understands graphics
4693.74,4698.3, Real-time graphics right you need to be blind to understand that is not the best looking game right now
4698.860000000001,4702.14," Well, I think again that might might be what you're talking about about the"
4702.7,4705.26, Expectations and people having seen it already yeah
4705.26,4712.22," Well, yeah, yeah, people were like oh yeah crisis it still looks great and then and call duties out like this season too"
4712.3,4714.3," which is you know, it's totally it's"
4715.26,4721.900000000001, So call of duty for example was a strong way of market mpr reveal was very well done time very well and
4723.66,4726.7, It looks great but it's not the best looking game
4727.66,4733.26, What's argue even it's not even it doesn't even look as good as gears of war in my opinion for example
4735.1,4737.42, There right that's all right. That's a high quote
4738.46,4742.46, That's the one there. I think that's a good point. You know because when I looked at it at the time
4742.54,4747.5, I was willing to call like PC bias or just because so many people in the the judge and again when the award
4747.5,4752.3, We're talking about specific people like like Jeff Green and most of them
4752.78,4754.06, I mean I'm guessing aren't
4754.86,4759.9800000000005, Avid PC gamers I didn't vote so my guess my suspicion was that that was gonna be part of the thing
4759.9800000000005,4763.9," But again, I think it's what you're saying. I mean the recent debut of call of duty"
4763.9,4768.06, I think has something to do with it because if you had unveiled crisis at this E3
4768.54,4774.14," Yeah, I'm pretty sure that it would yeah, I believe the call before probably one just because it was a surprise"
4774.46,4779.900000000001, But it's like you're talking about with seeing alien for the first time. I said what we did is we had we just
4779.900000000001,4784.06, We just one thing for example when we released the first tech trailer ever
4784.700000000001,4789.820000000001, We had from a million Google hits 12 million was in week
4791.34,4796.38, Now we are constantly about 15 to 25 million hits summer between that bit range all the time
4796.7,4802.86," It is great, but the jump we had the first to for the first reveal never had again right natural"
4803.42,4806.46," Okay, it's complete and standable and relatable"
4807.82,4811.18, Even not with revealing the first the extent trailer even that didn't make a spark
4811.74,4816.54," Yeah, it didn't like E3 it didn't make a fix the different events we had right see to me"
4816.54,4821.900000000001, The or the biggest surprise of the the Microsoft event that first night that they had in that big
4822.54,4826.3," Yeah, hoping thing the big surprise to me there was in all their"
4826.38,4834.46, Feel about all their games they showed crisis for like a quick second five second of the short thing cartoony and they had that gigantic screen and I thought
4834.46,4839.5, Why are you not showing off the best looking PC game on this huge screen for all these people
4840.46,4845.900000000001, A great portion of them who don't play PC games for them to see and my feeling was
4846.22,4848.22," Well, they felt like crisis"
4848.22,4853.74," You know we've been showing it forever already so yeah, there's I mean that's the the poem of it"
4854.54,4861.179999999999," For sure and again, for me it's really about making small splashes versus a making a big wave, you know"
4861.82,4863.82, The making it one wave
4864.219999999999,4866.219999999999, That overtakes
4866.219999999999,4870.82, Like it's it's a big wave rather than a little splash of drops specifically
4870.82,4878.82, So we won't drop any judges awards are our meaning less I mean I would I can't imagine for you other than for internal morale that you guys would would think too much of
4879.82,4882.98, I'm what it what is it really about mountain?
4883.459999999999,4888.74," Well, they want a word which was for us motivation. I mean there were its only motivation"
4889.299999999999,4895.299999999999, It's recognition it's an achievement. I always say it's not about our experiences about what we achieve as a story is what matters
4895.299999999999,4897.299999999999, That's what I tell to team
4897.299999999999,4901.459999999999, Nobody will carry how much experience you have everybody will care what do you achieve in your life and
4902.9,4903.94, So
4903.94,4910.9, The critic awards is an achievement for a studio and people can say look I like when we won the best PC game
4911.379999999999,4912.9, Award effectively
4913.139999999999,4915.139999999999," That was for us an achievement, but"
4915.78,4919.54, And what caused it it caused a huge motivation for the final phase of development
4920.339999999999,4924.42, That recognition only caused that nothing else no
4925.299999999999,4929.7, I don't know consequence and economics or design what's not just motivation
4930.98,4934.42, Which was already a long-distance cycle and to make that
4934.9,4937.299999999999, Somehow like because it's really last
4937.62,4946.66, It's a it's a pain for the all-perce to work on a project that long and take that long and get feedback for I mean to we'll to get the justification of you know
4948.34,4955.3, Is it here's a question that's gonna seem like because I know where how much time would you expect someone to have to spend with
4955.62,4959.78, Power struggle for example before that they were able to provide a reliable critique of it
4962.18,4964.18, Hmm
4964.66,4968.66, I think already in the first 50 minutes where they say to me they didn't get that and
4970.900000000001,4976.9800000000005, Then probably after two hours at a phase where they got rules and they play everything
4978.26,4982.26, But they may give feedback on the UI and then
4983.3,4985.3, probably
4985.780000000001,4990.02," Four to five hours to get a good sense of it, but to get really deep"
4990.9800000000005,4994.660000000001, You have to play it for probably two three weeks to get really deep in the everything
4995.540000000001,5001.780000000001, So to be mastering and to find tactics like we what we did is we are observed the common debater forms also
5002.18,5008.02, In terms of what kind of tactics people develop and they came up with tactics really which is what that's really some already
5008.02,5012.660000000001, You know like even even our curators that will play the game in and out
5013.3,5016.34, They didn't come up with ideas. Can you give in the examples of those?
5016.900000000001,5018.1," Yeah, for example"
5018.26,5020.26, What what happened in
5020.26,5024.58, Dispawn like in one of the beta tests for not beta test before the beta is doing our QA
5025.700000000001,5028.9800000000005, One what we had is we had something something called an expert group
5029.38,5034.9800000000005," Okay, so before we even started beta before we had something called friends a family in friends test"
5035.54,5039.54, Before the family in friends test we had a test called the expert club
5040.18,5043.700000000001, The expert club effectively were gamers which
5044.42,5051.94, Pro gamers and hardcore gamers the play multiplayer they were invited for two months every week to play against all QA
5053.139999999999,5055.139999999999, the mode and
5055.54,5059.139999999999, After three weeks for playing effectively three hours
5060.179999999999,5062.98, What they did is when they went back and because they were like a clowns
5063.46,5067.94, They went back they started thinking about what should we do and they formed a
5068.82,5072.099999999999, Technic and tactic which is resolved around a spawn truck
5073.78,5082.0199999999995, So they had people who guarded it effectively and they moved this is a spawning based closer
5082.58,5088.34," In closer like a Roman legend empire, you know they made attack mode closer attack close"
5088.34,5092.82, I think closer and I was guys didn't know what to do with it. How did he do is it?
5092.82,5097.0599999999995, They couldn't take it out with like I mean none of them were making enough money to get like a powerful tank
5097.0599999999995,5102.74, Or well they were old killing you know on the move they were because they would have takes everything with it in a giant
5103.219999999999,5106.179999999999, They were literally like a legend moving forward okay and
5107.3,5112.5," You have this that where the tactical new came from yeah, we have to countermeasures and develop for that"
5112.9,5119.7, But the principle idea is that people emerge with tactics of formations and groups because they units of physicalized and
5120.099999999999,5124.0199999999995, Everything they take like if you take a physical space of tanks it can't go through this
5125.0599999999995,5130.099999999999, Droid right you have to bypass the past so the block passes and things like this
5130.58,5137.14," And yeah, and and that's where it's it becomes really tactical on people emerged in techniques of tactics"
5138.1,5144.18, And seeing this happen in power struggle for the old various maps I think we'll take a lot of time and as
5145.14,5151.3, Critique you will probably have a good idea of it potential of it because I always say a good idea
5151.3,5152.900000000001, I was saying to ensure about this
5153.14,5155.54, Finally a good idea
5155.62,5163.62," As always a good idea if it inspires you so after you play you think about what I could do yeah, and so if you get if you get to thinking"
5164.0199999999995,5169.62, Then I think it means that you could play this for the next weeks and you always get new ideas and this is a total of
5170.42,5176.34, Naturally inherent the gameplay post of itself in her and the gameplay that inspires you for new tactics all the time
5177.86,5182.82," Yeah, definitely agree with that hardcore multiplayer. I mean like the very best games are the ones that you go to bed"
5182.9,5186.82, You mean that's where I'm out with team fortress to you right now. You know you turn the game off and you're like
5187.46,5193.299999999999, I would have tried this and I do this or that or thing you know and then you go back and you test it and experiment and you know sometimes pays off
5193.299999999999,5195.299999999999, Other times as long as you don't dream of it
5195.299999999999,5197.299999999999, Yeah
5197.62,5198.82," Okay, so"
5198.82,5202.42," We're getting the the wrap up call the wrap-up sign here. Oh, we'll still fun"
5202.58,5209.299999999999," Yeah, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to this. Thank you and we out we out we out"
