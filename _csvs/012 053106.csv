11.0,13.0, intraminable weeks now.
13.0,16.0, I've been trying to I spent a week thinking of how to do it.
16.0,17.0, Be like looking at the mirror.
17.0,18.0, I was.
18.0,20.0, I'd practice in front of my wife.
20.0,21.0, You got different donations.
21.0,23.0, This is this is.
23.0,24.0, Hi.
24.0,26.0," Anyway, this is the C.W podcast."
26.0,27.0, Hi.
27.0,31.0, And with me is the whole usual gang of editors plus
31.0,34.0, newbie editor who will introduce himself first.
34.0,35.0, Hi.
35.0,37.0," I'm Sean Mowar, the newbie editor."
37.0,39.0, I'm from the new managing editor.
39.0,40.0, Right.
40.0,42.0, He's not he's not newbie editor.
42.0,45.0," Not like, you know, he's not editor of newbies."
45.0,47.0," Like, could be he could be."
47.0,48.0, I'm sorry.
48.0,51.0, I'm totally derailing us already.
51.0,52.0, Good.
52.0,53.0, I'm Ryan Scott.
53.0,54.0, A right dog.
54.0,55.0, Sean Elliott.
55.0,56.0, I'm Ryan Scott.
56.0,58.0," And, uh, mixed-masting us today."
58.0,62.0, Mastering us is Mr. Andrew Fister.
62.0,64.0, Rock in the title.
64.0,65.0, Hi.
65.0,67.0," Uh, well."
67.0,69.0, Do we have anything to talk about?
69.0,73.0, So we have a lot to talk about.
73.0,74.0, I'm just kidding you.
74.0,78.0," Uh, but we're going to start off with the usual round of what are we playing?"
78.0,84.0," So because we know that you, you want to know what we're playing and we know that you know."
84.0,87.0, So what do we play?
87.0,90.0," Uh, Verizon Legends."
90.0,91.0, Verizon Legends.
91.0,94.0," Verizon, you know, they're in just started it last night too."
94.0,97.0, I intend to just to play it for five seconds and just see what it was all about.
97.0,101.0," And then like, four or three four hours later, like, oh crap."
101.0,102.0, I should go to sleep now.
102.0,105.0," Yeah, I'm about 10 missions into the first campaign."
105.0,107.0," So, and it's a really cool."
107.0,108.0, The building up for you.
108.0,109.0, Yeah.
109.0,110.0, Yeah.
110.0,115.0," The, uh, the turn-based element, like, that's the kind of thing that can totally go wrong."
115.0,123.0," Because anytime you have to defend against an attacker, there's a chance that you have to do the same exact mission over again."
123.0,131.0," You know, like, oh, now I get to defend the thing I just took over and just, this is back and forth that doesn't happen here because the, the way they do it with, uh, like, so it's the cultier."
131.0,132.0, Military districts.
132.0,135.0, You just kind of throw down military district and it automatically defends itself.
135.0,137.0," And if to worry about that, right?"
137.0,138.0, I like that a whole lot.
138.0,144.0," They, I've played about six or seven missions and it just feels to me so far like they've thought of everything."
144.0,150.0," You know, it's like a grab bag of, of, uh, goodies, like in every aspect of the game,"
150.0,153.0, there's this all sorts of stuff to be juggling and thinking about.
153.0,158.0," I'm just kind of amazed at the depth of it and not just depth of it, but like how accessible it is."
158.0,160.0, Like it could be so wonky.
160.0,161.0," I mean, it is a wonky game."
161.0,166.0," I think underneath, but it's packed so nicely and it's done so, uh,"
167.0,172.0," just done with such a friendliness that it just, I'm just overwhelmed actually how great it is."
172.0,179.0," And actually, I want to say I sort of regret that we sort of, I feel like we undercovered it in the magazine a little bit."
179.0,184.0," I think because I was just sort of bored even by the idea of it, I have to admit, you know."
184.0,187.0, Is that seem like another RTS?
187.0,192.0," I mean, I loved rights of nations, but this, but the sequel to seem like, yeah, I don't know."
192.0,194.0, I don't know how to say the farming in that game.
194.0,196.0," It's, it's minimal."
196.0,197.0, It's minimal.
197.0,200.0, There's little mining patches and you just build the mind and then end your down.
200.0,202.0, You don't pay attention to it.
202.0,203.0, Because it was a resignation.
203.0,205.0, So it's the one with like 70 types of dirt.
205.0,208.0," No, that was, uh, I know what you're talking about."
208.0,211.0, That was like age of empires that early ones.
211.0,212.0, All right.
212.0,213.0, I don't know what's going on.
213.0,214.0, They want to know how far one's had.
214.0,217.0," Yeah, this is actually pretty, and it's pretty easy."
217.0,219.0," I mean, all you're doing is you're just kind of like,"
219.0,222.0," you're throwing it on, so either throw them on and get some miners going on."
222.0,223.0, That's totally automated.
223.0,224.0, You build the cities.
224.0,225.0, Did they run out?
225.0,226.0, Did it mines run out?
226.0,228.0," No, no, mines don't delete."
228.0,229.0, Yeah.
229.0,231.0," And basically, you throw down more buildings in the, like,"
231.0,236.0," if you're more access to different, basically, to tech, tree choices as you go."
236.0,238.0," And here's another thing, too."
238.0,241.0," They, you know, this is like the fantasy version of Rise of Nations."
241.0,242.0, Right.
242.0,248.0," And I, I feel like they did a really successful job of coming up with like these three different sort of fantasy"
248.0,257.0, series cyber or steam punk races without it being either overly clich√© or just a rip off of other games.
257.0,260.0," Yeah, to me, this is like the first one since Starcraft that's pulled that off."
260.0,264.0," Yeah, it's been a while since there's been like, because I thought there was just pretty much no more"
264.0,266.0, of nowhere else to go with different things you could do.
266.0,271.0," But I like the, the jewels of earning in, yeah, main main group."
271.0,273.0," Yeah, they're really played with the other thing."
273.0,275.0," You're just like, holy crap."
275.0,276.0," That's like a good one, you know?"
277.0,278.0," Yeah, that's cool."
278.0,281.0," You know, it's not just the same wife walks by a unit comes up."
281.0,283.0, Holy crap.
283.0,284.0, It looks like a good one.
284.0,286.0, Let the earth an octopus walker.
288.0,290.0, Calling the lawyer now.
292.0,297.0," Um, anybody else playing anything Ryan go ahead, killed wars as usual."
297.0,299.0, It's still good.
299.0,301.0," Well, it's, he likes it so much."
301.0,302.0, He's credited it.
302.0,304.0," So when are you, when are you getting engaged in that game, man?"
304.0,307.0," You're like, totally at that point right now."
307.0,310.0," Yeah, what's the limit?"
310.0,312.0," You know, hundred hours and you're ready to."
312.0,315.0, I think I'm at about a hundred hours with this character right now.
315.0,317.0, I was at 93 last night's check.
317.0,318.0, That was a foul chase.
318.0,319.0, Yeah.
319.0,320.0, Has he heard the same?
320.0,321.0, Has he gone out?
321.0,322.0, It's been out.
322.0,323.0, It's been out.
323.0,324.0, I'm not.
324.0,325.0, I'm not.
325.0,326.0, It's been out.
326.0,327.0, It's been out.
327.0,328.0, I'm not.
328.0,329.0, Not yet.
329.0,332.0," But if you have a perfect, well, of yellow number five and,"
332.0,336.0," and the jar of silver, so you can make your perfect color."
336.0,337.0, Not yet.
337.0,338.0, I'm still looking.
338.0,339.0, I'm still looking for the yellow five.
339.0,342.0, Do you play the oblo as much as a scam?
342.0,343.0, No.
343.0,344.0, No.
344.0,345.0, We will live when the oblo came out.
345.0,346.0, Maybe that's a problem.
346.0,349.0," Yes, I was."
349.0,353.0," What, uh, so what game before this is because I've,"
353.0,356.0," I, this is the first time I've seen you go totally nuts over a game."
356.0,357.0, So don't you.
357.0,360.0," Uh, the last one that I've been kind of as creative."
360.0,361.0," That was, you know."
362.0,363.0, I'm not.
363.0,364.0, I can't.
364.0,368.0, I joined this staff in like the waning days of my U.O.
368.0,370.0, Addiction.
370.0,371.0, Wow.
371.0,374.0, A policy sets over the podcast.
374.0,376.0, As we pondered.
376.0,377.0," Oh, dude."
377.0,379.0, That was supposed to be the only.
379.0,385.0, I remember walking through a mine and sitting there with a whole bunch of people on our pack.
385.0,390.0, And it was just mining for to make some ring gloves until like three o'clock when all the kids get up to school to kill us all.
390.0,391.0, That was awesome.
391.0,392.0, Yeah.
392.0,393.0, It was a good story to forget.
393.0,399.0, You were playing other day and you told us to come look and you had like what 30 different gold farmers on screen at one time.
399.0,400.0," Oh, yeah."
400.0,401.0, Yeah.
401.0,404.0," It's trying to get you to go past them and you wouldn't really say you're like, hi guys."
404.0,405.0," I was like, man, give them some."
405.0,406.0, So that was like the real thing huh?
406.0,409.0, They were real live gold farmers like we've read about in the article.
409.0,410.0, Yeah.
410.0,411.0, Are there screenshots?
411.0,412.0, Oh yeah.
412.0,413.0, I've got a ton of screenshots.
413.0,414.0, We got three screenshots.
414.0,416.0, We put some mug shots in the magazine.
416.0,418.0, So they were all just like bots right?
418.0,419.0, Or yeah.
419.0,425.0," They were all these like, munk characters all dressed in the same armor all sort of walking the exact same path in his own."
425.0,428.0," And there was like, there's something like 40 out of him just standing there."
428.0,431.0, So they can carry out a guy's just kind of like walking along like a mess.
431.0,432.0, Like a mess.
432.0,433.0, I'm actually going to go in the bathroom and the box.
433.0,437.0, They were all the same class to like worry amongst munk slash warrior all of them.
437.0,441.0, To make him guild or sell like the Billy Jean video like that.
441.0,446.0, She's getting no ninja detective on them.
446.0,447.0," Well, okay."
447.0,449.0, So for what for what will now play?
449.0,450.0, I had to give my.
450.0,451.0, Okay.
451.0,453.0, So what guild or is this Orion battlefield is to me.
453.0,455.0, And this week I've been playing armored fury.
455.0,460.0," It's the new booster pack, which is the downloadable 999 content."
460.0,464.0, And also the new patch that comes out to comes out to go inside of it.
464.0,472.0, And so far I can't really report on how good the whole thing is because there's only one server up and running and I haven't been in there with more and four people I want.
472.0,475.0, So really what we've been doing is trying out the new vehicles and things like that.
475.0,478.0, The new light helicopters are completely awesome.
478.0,479.0, They're really fun.
479.0,486.0," I mean, they handle like, I don't know, not so squarely is like the grand theft out of helicopters, but they're really quick and nimble like that."
486.0,488.0," And then, but they're also not too destructive."
488.0,489.0, So it's a good balance.
489.0,490.0, But we are already messing around.
490.0,494.0," We're like, you know, you have guys sitting on the floor on the landing panels on the sides."
494.0,502.0, And we fly up parallel that next to another helicopter and throw some C4 charges across the air and onto their chopper and then remotely detonate that.
502.0,507.0," And then the new maps are all set in America, which is a nice change because so far everything's been China and the Middle East."
507.0,514.0, And so this actually has that distinctly new feel that you want from an expansion that you can get before with secret weapons or road to Rome.
514.0,521.0," So it's got, you know, middle America where you've got, you know, malls and stay houses and gas stations."
521.0,523.0, Big freeway overpasses and stuff.
523.0,525.0," And then, you know, something it'll ask us."
525.0,526.0, This is cool.
526.0,527.0, They're not actually recognizable landmarks.
527.0,528.0," No, they're not."
528.0,530.0, They're all distinctly generic.
530.0,534.0," But I mean, it's, it's definitely you can go somewhere and you can imagine, you know, the Walmart signs missing and whatnot."
534.0,536.0," But I mean, you know, the stir malls and stuff."
536.0,538.0, They all look the same and then they don't have civilians in them.
538.0,540.0," There's not like, no, people walk somewhere."
540.0,543.0, You can grab a semi truck or a hot rod or something.
543.0,544.0," So you can, you know, civilian vehicles."
544.0,548.0," But yeah, it's obviously it's the same as the other maps."
548.0,550.0," You know, you know, I have civilians running around a Walmart."
550.0,551.0, You can't.
551.0,554.0, That's what are the bad things about the same question.
554.0,561.0," Is you still can't, you know, the only geometry that are or parts of the environment that you can destroy are those that are specifically tagged for it."
561.0,567.0," So the funny thing now is that you've got these little picket fences around suburbia, but a tank will come to a dead stop with you right into them."
567.0,569.0," That's like, make that a concrete wall or something."
569.0,577.0," If you're not going to go, yeah, if they wanted to remain there to provide cover, but it's just hilarious seeing a guy safely hiding behind a picket fence is a take."
577.0,578.0, It's not.
578.0,581.0," Oh, yeah, it takes away a little of the magic on that."
581.0,583.0, But that's really cool.
583.0,593.0," So I'm looking forward to playing with more people and before I can give it the the the real thumbs up, but I got a monro quickly here before we move on about about the patch where actually introduced."
593.0,596.0," New problems where the browser and that's never been, you know,"
596.0,599.0, I battlefield developer dices is a strong point.
599.0,601.0," I mean, the browser and 42 is still broken."
601.0,603.0, So they broke it all over again.
603.0,612.0," And now the people that run their own solutions like to be a two auto loader, which I recommend anyone to plays the game are playing catch up now so that there's work with the with the newest patch and stuff."
612.0,625.0," And then some of the other bugs that kind of, you know, been diminishing or like back now in full force where you're stuck in a squad or you don't have access to the kids that you've unlocked, which is basically the ranking system in the game."
625.0,629.0, A teammate will appear and I mean those sorts of things are back in.
629.0,638.0," So it's kind of, you know, this hardening or like, hey, we're this far we're a full year away now from the official launch and now we're seeing these things again and we're introducing new errors and stuff."
638.0,640.0, So big thumbs down on that.
641.0,643.0, So don't get it yet.
643.0,645.0, So we were saying that's just a patch.
645.0,646.0, That's just a patch.
646.0,649.0," Yeah, so far the content on I mean, that's going to no matter what, that's what you got."
649.0,650.0, The patch needs a patch.
650.0,651.0," Yeah, and let's do it."
651.0,653.0, Up update your patch.
653.0,655.0," But the auto loader would just take takes care of a lot of that problem, right?"
655.0,657.0, It will as soon as they've got that worked out.
657.0,667.0," And then also to be fair on the official BF two site, they acknowledge the problem right away and they say they don't need to roll back to patch that they're able to fix things on their side on the servers and stuff."
667.0,668.0, But it's just another nitpake.
668.0,673.0," You know, I mean, we all you play game as much as is is a lot of us play that game and it's easy to get paid."
673.0,675.0," You know, you expect certain things."
675.0,677.0, We hate what we love best right.
677.0,681.0," And then the other thing will all be playing well, not all of us, most of us will get played."
681.0,683.0, Half like five episode one tonight.
683.0,684.0," Yeah, right."
684.0,685.0, Remember midnight.
685.0,686.0, Grab it now.
686.0,687.0, Free.
687.0,688.0, Free.
688.0,689.0," Ryan, he'll be playing guild."
689.0,690.0, Guild Wars.
690.0,695.0," Oh, and actually just a little bit of heads up for next time for the hit man, whatever the health of the new line money."
695.0,696.0, Thank you.
696.0,698.0," Uh, actually, first, what did you think of that one?"
698.0,699.0, Didn't play.
699.0,700.0, Okay.
700.0,701.0, Thank you.
701.0,702.0, It looks pretty cool.
702.0,704.0," Actually, that's how one that has those horrid ads in our magazine, right?"
704.0,705.0, Yeah.
705.0,709.0," Sorry for the hard as we had nothing to do with them, but the game does look pretty cool."
709.0,710.0," Just wanted to say, it has up is coming in."
710.0,712.0," I say, can I say that ads were hard?"
712.0,714.0," With that, I'm getting in trouble with."
714.0,717.0," They're pretty, they were kind of like, you know, little grizzly."
717.0,719.0," Yeah, you know, I'm sorry."
719.0,720.0, Maybe I'm disold.
720.0,724.0," I don't need like, you know, naked dead female bodies in my own account."
724.0,725.0, That one.
725.0,726.0, Okay.
726.0,727.0, Yeah.
727.0,728.0, I've seen plenty of those at one.
728.0,729.0, I go visit Robert Coffee.
729.0,730.0, Nice.
730.0,733.0, I'll be hearing from you later on that one.
733.0,735.0, It all comes full circle.
735.0,742.0," And I'll end my rant about what I'm playing now is this heroes five, which I don't really want to talk about much because I talked about it last week."
742.0,744.0, But still waiting for that patch.
744.0,745.0, You be soft.
745.0,748.0, Get on that patch because that game's going to be great when it gets patched.
748.0,750.0, It's near great now.
750.0,755.0," And as I said last week, it's incredibly annoying, incredibly annoying to know that you've got, you know,"
755.0,761.0," 48, 2 millioners are amps and the thing on screen is saying that you have 28 amps."
761.0,765.0, I need to know exactly how many amps I have to buy all this on.
765.0,767.0, Or I can't play the game.
767.0,768.0, That's true.
768.0,770.0, So it's actually in life.
770.0,772.0, It's basically an imp counter.
772.0,774.0, All you need is amps.
774.0,775.0, Okay.
775.0,779.0," So let's move on from what we're playing to, oh, another rant topic."
779.0,782.0, Let's talk about this stuff.
782.0,786.0, And what we learned about Halo 2 this week.
786.0,787.0, Okay.
787.0,791.0, Let's get this one off the fact that Halo 2 is not going to have live anywhere support.
791.0,792.0, Yeah.
792.0,794.0, Why even bother thinking for this game?
794.0,797.0," Because when they first announced Halo 2, like,"
797.0,799.0," was coming to this to exclusively, we were like,"
799.0,800.0, Huh?
800.0,801.0, Okay.
801.0,802.0, Whatever.
802.0,804.0," And then once they announced live anywhere,"
804.0,805.0," they were like, it kind of made sense."
805.0,806.0," You're like, oh, okay."
806.0,808.0, They're waiting for live anywhere to work.
808.0,809.0, And then you can play against the X-Box people.
809.0,811.0, And then it actually seemed like a worthy weight.
811.0,812.0, Right.
812.0,813.0, Okay.
813.0,815.0, I can wait as long as I can implement this cool new technology.
815.0,817.0, They were bragging about a D3.
817.0,818.0, Right.
818.0,820.0," And then they say, oh, it's not going to work with live anywhere."
820.0,821.0, And suddenly they were back to square once.
821.0,824.0, So what's the biggest stuff to leave with this thing now?
824.0,826.0, Because we're all like shiny or suit.
826.0,827.0," No, and the time I'm talking to you,"
827.0,829.0," taking a site, you know what, two, three,"
829.0,831.0, full years after it came out on console.
831.0,833.0," And they're going to bring it to PC with like,"
833.0,834.0, the drone.
834.0,835.0, No.
835.0,837.0, Anyone care about Halo 1 when it finally ported the PC.
837.0,840.0," That was, it was like after the fact, I mean, I didn't care."
840.0,842.0, Halo 1 when it came out on the X-Box.
842.0,843.0, Yeah.
843.0,844.0, It's a different topic.
844.0,846.0, Because you're playing Yolo or something.
846.0,847.0," You're playing Yolo 1, I bet."
847.0,848.0, Or you will.
848.0,849.0, You will.
849.0,850.0, Whatever.
850.0,851.0, Yeah.
851.0,852.0," I don't, I don't get it."
852.0,857.0," Every day, it feels like a one step forward two steps back with Microsoft and this stuff."
857.0,861.0," You know, like, you're like, yeah, they're finally doing something for PC."
861.0,864.0," And then, oh, oh, no, they're not."
864.0,868.0," Yeah, the only concessionly it else so far is that Halo 2 is going to have a map editor."
868.0,869.0, Great.
869.0,870.0, Good.
870.0,871.0, Right.
871.0,872.0, A map editor for the five game playing.
872.0,876.0, A map editor for because anything in that entire game is a triangle or a square.
876.0,878.0," I mean, of course, falling on it's our, but I mean, literally in this case,"
878.0,880.0, giant triangles and squares.
880.0,883.0, And then with either green or purple texture work on it.
883.0,887.0," So it's like, I mean, yeah, if you give people the fundamental blocks, you know, basically,"
887.0,888.0," I mean, building blocks."
889.0,893.0," So it's like, and you just put Lego like connectors on them, then you've got your map editor there."
893.0,894.0," You know, your hallway generator."
894.0,899.0, And where are they making maps? Who are you going to be making maps for the five other guys playing Halo 2 PC?
899.0,904.0," You know, but if they'd added the live anywhere, that would have been the killer, you know, the killer app to that."
904.0,906.0, That would have been the thing that made us.
906.0,909.0," But if it's still, I mean, we could play the, I don't know."
909.0,912.0," I don't know if it would have been killer, but at least would have made some logical stuff."
912.0,916.0," They would have to be some crazy like thing guns for us to be playing the,"
917.0,919.0, the Xbox live guys on Halo.
919.0,926.0," Like either they, they're, I mean, I guess if they have the auto way that they already have, and then there's no such thing on PC, that could make it."
926.0,931.0," That could be, but I still don't get it because your, their looks be could be so much faster on the PC."
931.0,932.0, I just don't know.
932.0,935.0, That's a big issue. I've been wondering about for like all of us.
935.0,937.0," Well, it was pretty much a balance for shadow run."
937.0,940.0," There's a, they actually, actually balanced out fairly well."
940.0,942.0," They just had to like, they tweak up the auto way."
942.0,943.0, Okay.
943.0,948.0," When you're playing against them, you, you, so you were playing against competent people on console and you run the PC version."
948.0,951.0," That's what's, that was happening at the show. Yeah. Okay."
951.0,957.0," I have to, I have to do it myself because I don't like the people at WebAssembly behind Huxley aren't convinced that there's a good solution to it."
957.0,966.0," And that's why for their game instead of putting, putting the two against one another, they're having them help on another in various ways, because they're not convinced that that's a disparity."
966.0,967.0, You can overcon it.
967.0,970.0, Is that perceived advantage or disadvantage to one over the other?
970.0,971.0, Of course.
971.0,973.0, And you see that a clarity of the image.
973.0,975.0," Well, yeah. It's just, it's not even a question."
975.0,983.0," Anyone who seriously plays those games, but seriously can't much faster and more accurate with what you said about like the console having auto hammer something like that."
983.0,984.0, That does compensate.
984.0,986.0, I would say no because of the speed to turn around.
986.0,993.0," I mean, even if they've got the aim assist where they're constantly on you with the, I mean, with the mouse, you were able to inhale, if you're a jump off."
993.0,997.0," Look at someone that's, you know, far to your right and then immediately turning it so far to your left."
997.0,1004.0," No, if you played Halo 2, turning between those two points of view is actually a pretty slow if you're playing on real or something."
1004.0,1009.0," But don't you think like that the top Halo 2 players are like, going to be listening to you now going like, no way, dude."
1009.0,1010.0, I'm sure.
1010.0,1014.0," I mean, and they'll have had the advantage of playing it for a few years too."
1014.0,1017.0, But I honestly don't think that you could ever.
1017.0,1020.0, It's the reason it's not like dirty secret or anything.
1020.0,1025.0," Anytime you set developer, you're like, hey, why don't you put mouse and keyboard support on you've got the USB ports on your console?"
1025.0,1027.0, Why don't you let us do it to choose?
1027.0,1032.0," We can't do it because it would destroy the playing field and they, it's just, they all, it's just accepted fact."
1032.0,1033.0, Okay.
1033.0,1036.0, How do they reason it would destroy the playing field?
1036.0,1040.0," Because anyone with a mouse and keyboard would have a series of, oh, I see."
1040.0,1044.0," Plus, I also think Microsoft is like kind of frowning upon the support for mouse support, right."
1044.0,1054.0," But for a, for a PlayStation something, the fun, the, the easy solution would be is to have your servers identify that your console has got one of those USB ports active."
1054.0,1056.0, And then so you can have mouse and only servers.
1056.0,1058.0," Yeah, yeah, and then you could still do that."
1058.0,1059.0, Uh-huh.
1059.0,1063.0," But otherwise, yeah, it just wouldn't be this one, be fair."
1063.0,1065.0, I'm vibrating.
1065.0,1066.0, Hmm.
1066.0,1067.0, I just thought it.
1067.0,1070.0, It's a minus whole topic is made you vibrate.
1070.0,1072.0, I don't know if that was picking up on the mic.
1072.0,1074.0, My cell phone vibrating.
1074.0,1076.0, So MMO charts.
1076.0,1077.0, MMO charts.
1077.0,1078.0," Oh, yeah."
1078.0,1079.0, Yes.
1079.0,1083.0," There's a, a wonderful website called MMOG Chart.com."
1083.0,1085.0, Where this guy and I'm so sorry. I know this for us.
1085.0,1087.0, I'm just Bruce. I'm sorry.
1087.0,1089.0, Next week I'll credit him for reels.
1089.0,1091.0, I think it's a that work.
1091.0,1093.0," Okay. Oh, it is."
1093.0,1094.0, It's calm.
1094.0,1095.0, Nevermind.
1095.0,1096.0, MMOG Chart.com.
1096.0,1097.0, Not org.
1097.0,1098.0, Sorry.
1098.0,1101.0," He, he does a kind of third party."
1101.0,1104.0, Uh-huh.
1104.0,1105.0, Hi.
1105.0,1106.0, Hi.
1106.0,1110.0," He, he, he charts the population of population."
1110.0,1113.0, All the MMOs.
1113.0,1115.0," Uh, and he's been doing this for a long time now."
1115.0,1118.0," And he just came out with his, his most recent chart."
1118.0,1121.0, And the statistics are pretty stunning.
1121.0,1123.0, And I'm going to read a few of them to you.
1123.0,1126.0, This is of worldwide as of May 2006.
1126.0,1129.0, The percentage of of people playing MMOs.
1129.0,1131.0, This is what they're playing.
1131.0,1134.0," So for example,"
1134.0,1136.0," Uh, of all the people playing MMOs."
1136.0,1139.0, 5.1% are playing five.
1139.0,1142.0, Are playing Final Fantasy 11.
1142.0,1145.0," Uh, Ultima Online 1%."
1145.0,1147.0," Um,"
1147.0,1149.0, Everquest one and two.
1149.0,1151.0, Combined.
1151.0,1153.0, 5.7%.
1153.0,1155.0," Um, this isn't adding up to a lot."
1155.0,1157.0, And why is that kids?
1157.0,1159.0, Because of world of work.
1159.0,1160.0, World of warcraft.
1160.0,1161.0, We're living.
1161.0,1163.0, We are living in the world of warcraft.
1163.0,1165.0, 50.6%.
1165.0,1168.0, Of all people playing MMOs are playing.
1169.0,1170.0," Well, the workcraft."
1170.0,1172.0, What is the next highest one?
1172.0,1174.0," The next highest one is, uh,"
1174.0,1175.0, linear lineage.
1175.0,1176.0, It's lineage one and two.
1176.0,1178.0," Actually, I didn't separate them out."
1178.0,1180.0, But lineage one and two combined are 21%.
1180.0,1183.0," I think it's, it's about like 10 and 11 each."
1183.0,1184.0, Right.
1184.0,1186.0, I think lineage one was 10% lineage.
1186.0,1188.0, So like 72% of the
1188.0,1190.0, MMO population is in these three games.
1190.0,1191.0, Right.
1191.0,1194.0, We need one to and World of Warcraft.
1194.0,1196.0," And because auto assaults like the night of the comet,"
1196.0,1197.0, there's like no one there.
1198.0,1201.0," The surprising thing and depressing thing to me,"
1201.0,1203.0," where things like city of heroes and villains,"
1203.0,1205.0," which we gave both those games covers,"
1205.0,1207.0, the presses all over those games.
1207.0,1209.0," You know, they, it won awards."
1209.0,1211.0, City of heroes and villains.
1211.0,1214.0, 1.4% combined.
1214.0,1217.0, That one's surprising me because I hear more people talking about that one.
1217.0,1220.0, Besides world of warcraft than any other ones on the list.
1220.0,1221.0, Maybe because it's more unique.
1221.0,1222.0, But probably.
1222.0,1223.0, Just kind of a shame.
1223.0,1224.0," I mean, if you were going to make up,"
1225.0,1228.0," you know, somebody asked you to just do a breakdown off the top of your head."
1228.0,1230.0, Would you have come anywhere that low?
1230.0,1232.0," Like if someone asked me and I was just like,"
1232.0,1235.0," oh, I know because I work at a gaming magazine."
1235.0,1236.0, I'll tell you.
1236.0,1238.0," Yeah, it's probably about 30% while."
1238.0,1241.0, 25% city of heroes.
1241.0,1243.0," But it's like, it's not even close."
1243.0,1244.0, Hmm.
1244.0,1245.0, It's surprising.
1245.0,1246.0, City of heroes.
1246.0,1248.0, I was in that game not that long.
1248.0,1250.0, Go to get a screenshot for something.
1250.0,1252.0," And I, there is nobody."
1252.0,1253.0, I think it's a little ghost home.
1253.0,1254.0, Yeah.
1254.0,1255.0, I had a lot of awesome.
1255.0,1257.0, Some guy to help me get a screenshot.
1257.0,1258.0, They're which game?
1258.0,1260.0, Into the of heroes.
1260.0,1264.0, A lot of people that was known as like more fun as a character.
1264.0,1266.0," Yeah, that's true."
1266.0,1268.0, So it's like a doll doll made for the.
1268.0,1269.0, Yeah.
1269.0,1271.0, What about what about the MMO that would change everything?
1271.0,1273.0," Yeah, that that one cracks me up."
1273.0,1275.0, We are reading in some magazine.
1275.0,1276.0, I forget which.
1276.0,1279.0," They said that's a dungeon of dragons online,"
1279.0,1283.0," which, you know, we've we think has a chair problems."
1283.0,1286.0, That game has 0.7% market share.
1286.0,1288.0, So I guess it's not really going to change everything.
1288.0,1289.0, Is it?
1289.0,1293.0," Well, it could change the way people think when they're deciding whether or not to make a new MMO."
1293.0,1295.0, It might change the way they think about doing it.
1295.0,1298.0, And I'm not the next time turbine does one.
1298.0,1300.0, Make the change that they think about monthly fees.
1300.0,1306.0, What cracks me up is that that's that's 0.7% and at 0.8% beating it by by one tenth is
1306.0,1307.0, $10.
1307.0,1308.0, So I think the idea is to town.
1308.0,1310.0, So I think the idea is to be all wrong.
1310.0,1314.0, We can say maybe not the splash hit everybody thought it was going to be.
1314.0,1317.0," But overall, I mean, this those figures are pretty depressing."
1317.0,1321.0," I mean, especially when we're looking for variety when we're looking for options."
1321.0,1324.0," I mean, I mean, well, point, you get where people say it's not even profitable to try."
1324.0,1327.0," You know, where it just becomes the at 1 MMO world."
1327.0,1328.0," Well, too."
1328.0,1329.0, When you get.
1329.0,1330.0," Well, I mean, the crazy."
1330.0,1332.0," Well, it definitely comes at point where it's like there's just, you know,"
1332.0,1335.0, it's just going to be a lot of times people will shift in mass.
1335.0,1337.0," So it's not like one, you know, you played stars,"
1337.0,1338.0, galaxies for two years.
1338.0,1341.0, And then you just on your own decide to go and move.
1341.0,1344.0," You'll have a good, you know, 20 or 30 people that you're used to playing with."
1344.0,1346.0, And you all kind of decide on message boards.
1346.0,1347.0, It builds up.
1347.0,1348.0, Yeah.
1348.0,1349.0, And I've seen this happen.
1349.0,1356.0," And you know, you know, you're going to have a good, you know, 20 or 30 people that you're"
1356.0,1357.0, used to playing with.
1357.0,1359.0, And you all kind of decide on message boards.
1359.0,1360.0, It builds up.
1360.0,1361.0, Yeah.
1361.0,1362.0," And you know, right about it."
1362.0,1366.0," In other case, like TL Taylor's book on on MMO spaces."
1366.0,1368.0, And the whole group will just open to side to go.
1368.0,1372.0," And it's off to the most successful, most populated game with a thriving economy with the"
1372.0,1376.0," greatest number of options in terms of, you know, the social ability and all that."
1376.0,1379.0, And then so the bigger ones just snowball and keep getting more.
1379.0,1382.0," And then yeah, getting some kind of critical mass on the up starts."
1382.0,1383.0, It's just really difficult.
1383.0,1384.0, Right.
1384.0,1385.0, We're talking about auto assault.
1385.0,1386.0, There's like five of them right in there.
1386.0,1387.0, And we want more.
1387.0,1388.0, But now we're going to get it.
1388.0,1390.0," And that's the kind of game that like, we as like game critics are kind of all over."
1390.0,1392.0, And the way because doing something different.
1392.0,1395.0," It's like, oh, it's not elves and it's not swords and it's kind of cool and different."
1395.0,1396.0, But then no one does it.
1396.0,1398.0, And you're kind of getting the press.
1398.0,1400.0," I mean, the good thing about the whole."
1400.0,1405.0, Wow thing is that it's bringing a lot more people into the genre as a whole.
1405.0,1407.0, Like before I was a lot more into G.
1407.0,1409.0, And I'll just like a ton of people are playing.
1409.0,1410.0, Right.
1410.0,1411.0, Yeah.
1411.0,1413.0, How many of the people that play that are people that wouldn't have been playing games.
1413.0,1414.0, I think it's a lot.
1414.0,1415.0, Yeah.
1415.0,1416.0, Yeah.
1416.0,1417.0, Yeah.
1417.0,1420.0," Is that mean, but they're not going to want to leave that to go play."
1420.0,1421.0, Yeah.
1421.0,1422.0, If there's a play.
1422.0,1423.0, Wow.
1423.0,1425.0, Those people will typically play those games for a long long time.
1425.0,1427.0, Those are the people still playing ever quest one.
1427.0,1429.0," You know, when you scratch your head, say who is doing that?"
1429.0,1430.0, Yeah.
1430.0,1431.0, Those are the people.
1431.0,1432.0, So much.
1432.0,1433.0, If you're playing the car.
1433.0,1434.0, Yeah.
1434.0,1435.0, It's rough.
1435.0,1437.0," I mean, when you look at this, you know, if you start counting the numbers."
1437.0,1438.0, Stars go out.
1438.0,1440.0," Seasons at one point five percent, by the way."
1440.0,1445.0," But all these games that, you know, we've thought either they're wow killers or they can hold their own against."
1445.0,1446.0, Wow.
1446.0,1447.0, Okay.
1447.0,1448.0, And they're going to get them together.
1448.0,1450.0, Done as in dragons online.
1450.0,1451.96," CD of heroes, star wars, galaxies."
1451.96,1453.96," Ever quest two, they don't add up to even light."
1453.96,1455.96, They don't even get 10%.
1455.96,1457.96, And a hundred percent with all those versus wealth.
1457.96,1458.96, 50.
1458.96,1459.96, That's a word of caution.
1459.96,1462.96," Anyone who'd ever write about something being a wow killer or something, you know,"
1462.96,1467.96," you see the other ones like, you know, it's almost safer to say that something's a half life killer or whatever,"
1467.96,1468.96, GTA killer.
1468.96,1469.96," But yeah, wow killer."
1469.96,1476.96," I was working on the NMO, I'd be tempted to throw in the towel."
1476.96,1478.96, That's a level 60 score.
1478.96,1480.96, How are you going to go against this game?
1480.96,1482.96," Well, it needs to be nerfed."
1482.96,1483.96, Seriously.
1483.96,1485.96," No, but I mean, like, the, so the other 65 other masterpieces on the way."
1485.96,1487.96," I mean, what's going on with that."
1487.96,1491.96," What, what might take it is something along the lines of a sims or something."
1491.96,1494.96," I would figure something with that just crazy, massive peel."
1494.96,1496.96," Well, they tried the sims online."
1496.96,1497.96, I know.
1497.96,1507.96," I don't think it's going to be like a world of stark out or something, which I think is a more limited appeal to like the entire set of possible players in the world than the fantasy motif, you know,"
1507.96,1513.96," but I mean, something like that where you can get just people of all ages, men, women, you know, it could be something like that."
1513.96,1515.96, It's not going to be such like an audience.
1515.96,1517.96," You'll just, you'll, we're even count on this."
1517.96,1518.96," I don't know, it's not count."
1518.96,1519.96, Yeah.
1519.96,1522.96, Because they're looking at monthly subscriber fees as one of the criteria.
1522.96,1523.96, I think I think.
1523.96,1524.96," Yes, probably."
1524.96,1537.96," I'll make sense, but I'm saying maybe, maybe that's the way some of these games have to go and kind of like think of new models for like how the way I've seen it is just like it's a mind share thing that takes away like for a little while like oblivion, right, for a while, everybody was just playing that."
1537.96,1542.96," And so people stop talking about, wow, people stop playing while at least in our circle."
1542.96,1545.96, But then a game like oblivion burns itself out.
1545.96,1550.96," Meanwhile, while, you know, soldiers aren't actually back to playing well myself."
1550.96,1551.96, Yeah.
1551.96,1552.96, Does wow not burn itself out?
1552.96,1553.96," I mean,"
1553.96,1558.96," I'm working on my second, like level sixy character and prison."
1558.96,1561.96, I don't think it's going to play with the group of people.
1561.96,1563.96," It's totally, it's totally a group of people."
1563.96,1564.96, It's totally the people I play.
1564.96,1565.96, It feels people weren't there.
1565.96,1567.96, I bet you would put it away.
1567.96,1568.96, I probably know what.
1568.96,1570.96," I mostly play solo though, and I keep picking it back up."
1570.96,1571.96," Yeah, okay."
1571.96,1574.96, So I've got multiple characters that I keep trying to love.
1574.96,1576.96," I mean, it's one of the brilliant things about that game."
1576.96,1580.96, Is that the different races and classes really do affect the way the game plays.
1580.96,1584.96," So you can go through the same areas with the new guy and have so much fun just like,"
1584.96,1587.96," Oh, now I have a pet so I can kill the guy this way."
1587.96,1588.96, I don't know.
1588.96,1589.96," They just give you, there's so much."
1589.96,1591.96, I think that this game actually earned it.
1591.96,1593.96, I think this was like the good guys winning.
1593.96,1598.96," You know, they made a totally kick ass game and they're dominating the market for a reason."
1598.96,1599.96," For good reason, you know."
1599.96,1603.96," I mean, you know, this isn't the Da Vinci code."
1603.96,1607.96, This is something good that's popular that earned it.
1608.96,1614.96, So as much as the people aren't ready for something beyond orcs and elves and demons laying and stuff.
1614.96,1616.96, I don't know.
1616.96,1617.96, I don't know.
1617.96,1618.96," I mean, we're all the work."
1618.96,1623.96," Like, it's comparatively so easy to get into and it just looks so much cooler."
1623.96,1625.96," Like, even the icons, you're just like those are awesome icons."
1625.96,1626.96, I want to click those.
1626.96,1630.96," And like, does that other, a lot of them, I don't have that."
1630.96,1633.96, And that's a really big entry point for people.
1633.96,1639.96," I know, you also, it's so far setting is nothing but just a veneer, you know, all the mmo's are the same game with different skins."
1639.96,1643.96," We'll not the same game, but, you know, more so than they're more alike than they're different."
1643.96,1645.96," Well, that's really fine to ever quite."
1645.96,1649.96," And that like, you know, say, you know, auto saw like we're talking about before an engineer's your monk."
1649.96,1654.96," You know, you've got basically all these standards no matter where you transplant that setting."
1654.96,1657.96, You're basically looking at the same tropes and ideas.
1657.96,1658.96, Right.
1658.96,1659.96, You're going to have the new girl.
1659.96,1660.96, You're going to have the healer.
1660.96,1662.96, I do think the art direction knows a huge thing.
1662.96,1667.96," And wow, it's just such a pleasing, like, you know, like pleasant world to be in."
1667.96,1669.96," No, it's just, it's just cool."
1669.96,1670.96, I love living.
1670.96,1672.96, I'm actually a bit funny.
1672.96,1673.96, There was something for that.
1673.96,1678.96, Get the game to work good even on like a low end system because it's not right to be hyper real estate.
1678.96,1679.96," Yeah, I play that my last hand."
1679.96,1680.96, Back to.
1680.96,1684.96, And I play that my laptop and it's fine.
1684.96,1689.96," Yeah, you know, I was watching my daughter play because she's just been into it for the longest time now."
1689.96,1693.96," Oh, God, she's like posting on Alica Zam message boards now."
1693.96,1697.96," And she's in the warrior class forum, you know, she's going to have her own entry in in"
1697.96,1700.96," Cyclopea, Dramaticah within weeks."
1700.96,1707.96," Yeah, it's like making me like wish she had a my space page, you know, looking for boys because this thing was so geeky."
1707.96,1710.96," It was like, oh my god, what if I, what if I created here?"
1710.96,1714.96," Because she's on the on the warrior board saying, I can't decide between a plus three."
1714.96,1716.96, So are there a plus four acts.
1717.96,1721.96, God damn posting your ball about boys or something.
1721.96,1724.96," Now just kidding, don't."
1724.96,1725.96, Go to the song.
1725.96,1726.96, Go to the music.
1726.96,1727.96, Be a geek.
1727.96,1728.96, Be a geek is good.
1728.96,1729.96, Geek is good.
1729.96,1734.96," But what I was going to say is I was watching a play the other day because he was playing for hours and I was like, what is she doing?"
1734.96,1739.96," And she's very, very social like I always want to solo in that game when I see people."
1739.96,1742.96," I know online if I see them come on, I usually log off."
1742.96,1743.96," So I'm like, oh shit."
1744.96,1745.96, You're scooter.
1745.96,1746.96, I got to leave.
1746.96,1747.96," There's gotta be, I got to try it."
1747.96,1753.96," Because I'm thinking of like guild wars or something and when I play, if there's no other person to talk to in joke around with in team speak,"
1753.96,1756.96," the actual game itself, there's like no there there."
1756.96,1757.96, You just bring a button on a.
1757.96,1760.96," But to me, wow, it's just like it's like the oblo online."
1760.96,1764.96," Like I like playing, I like playing this game knowing there are other people around."
1764.96,1766.96, I just don't want to be with them.
1766.96,1767.96, You don't want dies.
1767.96,1768.96," Yeah, I'm not."
1768.96,1769.96, I'm not.
1769.96,1770.96, All done.
1770.96,1772.96, I like waving to them from far away.
1772.96,1773.96, I'm doing my own very.
1773.96,1778.96, But my daughter was like typing away and just looking very busy in a social way.
1778.96,1780.96, So I went up and asked her what she was doing.
1780.96,1784.96, And she's like in this guild where and she's unlike this.
1784.96,1787.96, It's just was amazing to me that this this game allows you to do this.
1787.96,1793.96, The guild the guild had this one woman had started this like party committee.
1793.96,1798.96," And and my daughter was like the you know, the assistant to this party committee."
1798.96,1801.96, What they're doing is they're designing costumes and baking cookie.
1801.96,1806.96, And baking cookies for for the holiday season for Halloween and Christmas.
1806.96,1807.96, Months from now.
1807.96,1812.96," So like they're sitting there like collecting all the stuff they need to to like, you know, make."
1812.96,1814.96, Costumes and bake cookies.
1814.96,1817.96," I'm telling you, no, no, you left when I brought up a Sims light game."
1817.96,1821.96," I didn't even Sims online, but that's why I'm saying that's the kind of stuff that."
1821.96,1825.96," You know, that that's responsible at least in part for those numbers."
1825.96,1828.96, So maybe the end guard's going to like win people then.
1828.96,1831.96," That's that's what they're all about, you know, crafting your medieval AIDS quilters."
1831.96,1832.96, Something like that.
1832.96,1836.96, That's just a black quilt.
1836.96,1841.96," Wow, that was a question about that."
1841.96,1843.96, Last thing that you searched about that quilt.
1843.96,1852.96, You should also be concerned that we're when my space and we're the work of combined because there's definitely some of that kind of troll and going on in the.
1853.96,1859.96," Predators looking for little like nom female nom rugs, uh, the troll."
1859.96,1862.96," Uh, we're probably, we winded down skip."
1862.96,1864.96," We're, we're at half an hour."
1864.96,1866.96, We've been the hammering for half an hour.
1866.96,1869.96," Um, did we have anything else you want to talk about kids this week?"
1869.96,1872.96," We, we ran to the hot halo."
1872.96,1873.96, Right.
1873.96,1874.96, The hot halo.
1874.96,1878.96," Oh, you guys were talking right before we went on about some lupic arts technology."
1878.96,1879.96," Oh, yeah."
1879.96,1886.56," So we end on a happy note. Yeah, happy good stuff. Yeah, so some cool stuff that Lucas Arches has got clicked up there finally"
1887.16,1894.0," We'll not finally, but they're working more closely with the guys in industrial light magic on their technology and they've come out"
1894.0,1896.0, I forget this specific names for the two
1897.1200000000001,1900.96," pieces software, but basically what one does is it allows"
1902.28,1907.24, For you know enhanced degree of destructible objects and geometry and things like that in game
1907.24,1911.2, So where is the current model right now? No no matter what your game is is to have one
1911.92,1916.14, Asset which could you know in this case could be a fence or something and then at the moment that it gets hit
1916.14,1920.64, They do a trick of the eye and they transplant it with two pieces and then you know
1920.64,1922.64, Hence broken or five pieces or whatever
1922.64,1929.48, This time the pieces are to uniform it's there and it can splinter break on any number of you know different axes each time you do it
1929.68,1932.6, So if it's a board it's gonna break in splinter different ways
1932.6,1935.7199999999998, They can change the flexibility of it all just various lighters and whatnot
1935.7199999999998,1943.1999999999998, So it's gonna bend then they can change the the material type from rubber to ice to copper tin whatever kind of metal
1943.1999999999998,1948.56," You know, so they're throwing shown examples where they're firing you know R2D2s at high speed against"
1949.8,1954.9199999999998, Jarring carbonite jar jar in in gelo and it just looks great
1954.9199999999998,1957.24, The physical properties was really great right there
1957.24,1959.76, You were seeing jar jar like explode in different ways right
1960.76,1965.24," So the dead thing was really cool too, you know, it's dynamic and then then they can mix these properties"
1965.24,1968.16, So it's like you can have a statue that's got you know a concrete core with
1968.72,1971.68, Crystal shards around the base and they'll each act their own way
1971.8799999999999,1977.16, Very specifically and then another thing that they have to combine it with is the new animation technology
1977.16,1980.28, Where instead of having to go by hand and anticipate every possible
1980.64,1986.6," Movement that's going to occur in the game and create it, you know and basically limit it by what they've animated it on the fly it will"
1987.12,1993.12, Sort of like it's tied into the AI where it will actually just perform in the context as the each new novel context occurs
1993.12,1997.12, So it could be like Darren was saying you get put an enemy gets pushed up against a car
1997.12,2002.4399999999998, He'll lean try to brace himself on the vehicle if he falls to the ground who actually push himself up in a different way
2002.4399999999998,2007.3999999999999, That recognizes if it's an uneven surface if he landed on a break or something like that
2007.9599999999998,2009.9599999999998, And then so
2009.96,2011.96, In the demo was really cool is that they were showing
2012.64,2017.88, Where they had these wood beams stretched across a ceiling and they would throw stormtroopers at him and then
2019.28,2025.3, Dynamically they would hang on to it for support so they would get smashed against it and if they could they'd grab it and as they accumulated
2025.3,2029.3, It would become heavier and heavier and the beam would start to crack but then they were grabbing at each other's legs
2029.3,2033.16, And so there's a big chain of them and they all eventually become so heavy they break the board collapse
2033.48,2039.3600000000001," But if you look at in terms of a game like half life too, we're now you pick up someone with a super gravity gun"
2039.36,2041.36, All in half the coffee
2042.84,2048.4, Then what happens is they become a static ragdolls just they become an inert object now
2048.7999999999997,2053.52, This technology you'd have the possibility for them to be flailing around and resisting if you swept them by the
2053.52,2060.3199999999997, Nye and grading they could grab onto it and resist wow they could kick they could still probably grab a gun if they had one hole through or something like that
2060.3199999999997,2062.88, And so it changed you know if if they're crushed in an object
2062.88,2067.3199999999997, They could then push that object off of them all these things that we just take a far too much memory
2067.32,2071.28, If you were to individually code for every possibility contingency in a game
2071.28,2075.54, So I think those two technologies and combination could radically change
2076.32,2077.92, Forever more just like
2077.92,2084.4, Just dragging the way I think that like the introduction of physics heavy-cut physics
2084.4,2089.32, Game that it will it will be one of those things where if games don't have it
2089.32,2093.32, You'll definitely recognize that lacking that technology right the way that it goes with normal mapping
2093.32,2101.0," What right now so the character animation I didn't see this demo, but it does look realistic because it sounds like what you're describing like it could"
2102.8,2106.48, I still very are they have signed limitations to anatomy and whatnot
2106.48,2112.0800000000004, So obviously you know arms and legs bend in certain ways and you're not gonna get up like a bulldoze from a soul caliber or crab
2112.0800000000004,2117.0800000000004," If you're thrown to the ground so they put parameters on on each object, you know"
2117.0800000000004,2119.6800000000003, If it is a real ragdoll then it can move in all degrees
2119.68,2124.06," But if it's him and body, it's not going to so it looked what they were showing looked really convincing"
2124.06,2127.16, Provided we weren't you know being exposed to some kind of smoke and mirrors
2127.16,2131.04," Yeah, I mean like I mean like that's been a problem in the past whenever you see a havoc physics or any"
2131.04,2134.96, You know rap ragdoll physics demo it's like someone just cut the Marionette strings just threw it against the right
2134.96,2138.9199999999996, I would be right because there's something that you said for right hand animating things no absolutely
2138.9199999999996,2142.16, And as long as you kind of like put several images for the joins like Sean saying
2142.16,2145.4199999999996, I mean they it looked pretty believable and obviously is still early on the first
2145.94,2147.82, Implementation is gonna be in the Indiana Jones game
2148.1,2151.8, But they were also kind of tentatively saying that there's some kind of forced powers game
2151.8,2154.98, It's gonna you know then Jedi base that's gonna like show off what this can do as well
2155.54,2157.54, Think about the game is too much like it's either
2157.9,2162.82," Your their dead are alive, you know there's so few intermediate states and lots of suboxing games or something"
2162.82,2165.78, So it's like you shoot a guy and you go this down and that's it this increases
2165.78,2170.16," I mean just the idea that you're looking at your like hey, what if you had a terminator type thing where he gets better"
2170.16,2172.94," You know, he just keeps getting back up no matter what you're throwing at him"
2172.94,2180.2400000000002, You know some kind of thing like the the tyrant in the in the rest of the evil games on PlayStation and I mean so it's I think that those are
2180.2400000000002,2185.4, Technologies that like wouldn't use wisely will actually lead to new varieties of gameplay experiences and
2186.4,2189.66, The other thing about that is that those technologies are gonna remain there since
2189.66,2194.54," Oh 2008 and they'll go middleware at that time, but I highly suspected other people will reinvent the wheel"
2195.2000000000003,2199.94, Before then and we'll start seeing that in a number of games in the same way I did with a number of other key technologies
2200.3,2203.5, I was just really surprised it kind of the announcement came out it just before you threw it and they showed it
2203.5,2206.42, At the end of the show and no one's really been talking about this at all
2206.42,2207.86, That's because we are all playing the Wii
2207.86,2213.18," Yeah, it just wasn't it didn't everyone that did see it you know was like wow that was you got to go see it"
2213.18,2214.46, That's one of the things that makes the show
2215.46,2220.2200000000003, You know for a lot of people's kind of like when you when you saw the first substantial half left two demo where you're like wow
2220.2200000000003,2223.3, Look at all these things going on. I just didn't want to see any more Star Wars
2223.7400000000002,2225.5, That's that's part of the thing yeah
2225.86,2230.06, Because the game that they're that they're soliciting with it is basically if you take like a
2230.06,2235.98," Siaps or something where you've got you know these telchnet powers in this case the force you know, so they've got they've got that down"
2235.98,2240.62, And you just take it to you know the complete extreme where when you're grabbing a guy
2240.62,2243.02, Instead of force pushing them and giving this little cheesy push
2243.42,2246.5, They're you know they're grabbing on to things as they're trying to escape your grasp
2246.5,2250.38, You can actually you know in the demo they showed which you know was prefab
2250.58,2255.42, They throw you know a tie fighter comes flying in so you actually throw a guy in a bunch of trash right into the
2255.42,2257.42, High fighter and things like that so it could be
2258.1800000000003,2260.1800000000003, Star Wars to me is like according to Jim now
2260.46,2262.46, It's like that's
2264.46,2266.46, Anyone watch that
2266.46,2270.78," We still have to talk about Star Wars all the movies are over, but I've never watched a recording to Jim"
2271.1800000000003,2275.34," Why I tried watching once okay, but just the first few seasons and"
2275.94,2281.96," We're like that whole soulless vibe is rubbed off on the on the Star Wars games, you know like when you when I think of the Star Wars games"
2281.96,2285.76, I just think just this week when you say tie fighter my eyes glaze over right
2286.0,2290.04," Yeah, there's just no backbone there. Okay, I'd like a battle start galactic a franchise instead"
2290.04,2296.06, But take that technology make it a full throttle game. There you go. That was Ryan Ryan right been bored for like last 15 minutes
2296.06,2298.06, You sit there. I wish I was playing Guild Wars
2299.2400000000002,2301.2400000000002, Hell yeah
2301.2400000000002,2303.2400000000002, Hey Ryan how was your root canal
2304.2400000000002,2306.2400000000002, Right in a recognized yesterday
2306.24,2308.24, I know
2308.24,2313.2799999999997, Readers want it up the listeners want it out. How was it for anyone who's never had a root canal out there?
2313.2799999999997,2318.6," It's not as painful as you probably think it's so good for fun, so it's a bad like analogy"
2318.6,2322.7999999999997," No, like you can't say oh, this is bad as a root canal because it's really not that bad. It's not that bad"
2323.6,2325.6, Believe me. I know
2326.4399999999996,2332.9399999999996, You get dope up enough anything's one good oral hygiene very important you heard it here first
2332.9399999999996,2334.9399999999996, So you'd be podcast is educational
2336.24,2338.24, And informative
2338.24,2340.24, Promotional
2340.24,2346.7," All right, I think I think that's it for the week. Did you get Sean to give something else or now I was just gonna ask Ryan if if he thinks that technology"
2346.7,2349.6, They could make the characters mouse moving Guild Wars cutscenes it last
2353.24,2357.7999999999997, Is that what those games are they just sit there without their mouse moving? They're all psyched and they're all talking in their screaming
2357.7999999999997,2362.7, And they're supposed to be all this emotion and you look over on the screen or just this own face. There's no free rendered stuff
2362.7,2364.7, It's all all the cutscene are like in engine
2364.7,2366.7, You know
2366.7,2368.7, I was just skip past cutscenes
2369.2,2373.2599999999998, That's the game what you're in a party you got eight people that lets you choose skip
2373.2599999999998,2375.4199999999996, But you have to everyone has to be unanimous
2375.4199999999996,2380.58, So you sit there and there's always that one fool that won't skip it. It's like you six time you've done the mission and wipe down
2380.58,2384.8599999999997, You know what though if I was in a party and I would be the one who wouldn't do it just to a really
2386.8599999999997,2388.8599999999997, The story is always
2388.86,2394.1400000000003," Five of these are good even kill ten of those and he's happy that you did it like there's nothing to learn there, man"
2395.1400000000003,2400.82, There's backstory Sean it's more it's the lore. There's a reason behind you collecting those ten things
2403.02,2409.2200000000003," Okay, well, thank y'all for listening and thank you boys for for talking"
2410.02,2412.02, Thank you skip for engineering
2413.1,2417.7400000000002," Just lots of thanks for everyone. Okay, well, I think a bad date. Thanks for talking. It was nice that you"
2419.82,2422.1400000000003, Thank you talking that get the hell out of my car
