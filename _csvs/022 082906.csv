20.0,22.0, Thanks for watching.
22.0,24.0, Thanks for watching.
50.0,52.0, Thank you.
52.0,54.0, Thank you.
54.0,56.0, Thank you.
56.0,58.0, Thanks for watching.
86.0,102.0, Sean Elliott's crisis review or preview which had led to a threat on one up where somebody was burating him for his vocabulary and I had gone around and asked you all if you knew what the word perspicacious meant because he used that in the preview.
102.0,106.0, And we admitted for those of you which is all of you who didn't hear the first time.
106.0,111.0, That none of us knew what that word meant but now Darren have you looked it up.
111.0,117.0, Yes actually the definition is acutely insightful and wise as used in a sentence.
117.0,124.0, Much too perspicacious to be taken in by such a spurious argument so I'm sure that was actually a sentence probably used by Sean Elliott and well.
124.0,133.0, Right so there you have it that's what perspicacious means and yeah never say that we're not educational layer at CGW.
133.0,136.0, We're here to inform you and entertain you.
136.0,138.0, Incautain you.
138.0,140.0, Incautain you.
140.0,143.0, That's in foe chain man.
143.0,146.0, Yeah never like that word.
146.0,150.0, Okay so so I've played nothing because I've been too busy.
150.0,158.0, I've been too busy pimping games for Windows and not playing but has anybody else been playing games in the last week.
158.0,160.0, Ryan.
160.0,163.0, I've played a little bit of evil in mind mostly.
163.0,167.0, I've just been packing for my impending move.
167.0,171.0, No when you say playing evil in mind you mean actually playing it or just letting your character level up in the background while you.
171.0,173.0, I'd actually you've been playing in a matter of what right.
173.0,175.0, I played a little bit of it.
175.0,177.0, Not not too much.
177.0,182.0, I'm kind of curious to play Deathcon which I think a lot of you guys have been playing.
182.0,183.0, I played that last week.
183.0,184.0, I played that last week.
184.0,185.0, That's cool.
185.0,190.0, I did not do it enough yet that I really know what I'm doing and be like and hold my own.
190.0,193.0, I'm still kind of in two Torreal phase but it's really cool.
193.0,194.0, It's fast.
194.0,198.0, I'm kind of bummed I didn't get a chance to play much of it because I had to go to Penny Arcade Expo.
198.0,201.0," But before I went there was one thing I did notice which is pretty cool is that there's like,"
201.0,203.0, it makes it to minimize game mode.
203.0,209.0," So as you're playing it, I mean this is basically encouraging you to goof off at work which is like a boss kick."
209.0,210.0, They call it office mode.
210.0,217.0, So you double tap the escape key and it minimizes and it becomes a little icon in your desk tray.
217.0,220.0," And then like if there's an event that pops up or something that really demands your attention,"
220.0,224.0, a little like a notification box comes up and you click that and it goes right into the game.
224.0,226.0, But those you don't know what Deathcon is.
226.0,233.0," It's a, this, you've ever seen War Games global thumb up thermonuclear war that fake game that the computer plays."
233.0,237.0, It's pretty much that it's developed by the guys you did Darwinia.
237.0,241.0, So kind of has that same kind of simple but glowy look to it.
241.0,244.0," And don't forget a, a, a, a, a, a blank."
244.0,246.0, I think the game is before that awesome game.
246.0,247.0, That was super.
247.0,251.0, I didn't realize actually the uplink and Darwinia were the same guys.
251.0,254.0, So they're on a big role does that company.
254.0,255.0," What, who is it?"
255.0,256.0, Introversion.
256.0,257.0, Okay.
257.0,264.0, But it's kind of like their mantra make these like very like low low deck games that are just really good.
264.0,271.0," And you know in this day and age, everyone's like worrying about like the, you know, the uncanny value and having these super hyper realistic graphics."
271.0,272.0, Right.
272.0,274.0, Here's a game just it looks good.
274.0,275.0, Right.
275.0,276.0, And unique and fun.
276.0,277.0, It's fun as hell.
277.0,281.0, How weird is it that it took all this time for someone to make a game based on war games.
282.0,286.0," You know, that was such a, a, an idea just waiting for us."
286.0,287.0, Yeah.
287.0,288.0, Too long.
288.0,290.0, I say too long indeed.
290.0,295.0, Other other games been that have been played by the W people.
295.0,297.0, That was kind of an essence.
297.0,298.0, Yeah.
300.0,302.0, A good time was had by all.
304.0,307.0," A non PC game, but a damn fun one is den rising."
307.0,308.0, Dead.
308.0,309.0, Yeah.
309.0,310.0, Everybody you're still playing the two.
310.0,310.5, Yeah.
310.5,311.0, Yeah.
311.0,311.5, Yeah.
311.5,313.5, A little bit for all my so he killing needs.
313.5,315.5, It's still frustrating in a lot of ways.
315.5,320.5, It's a awesome game wrapped around some really stupid design decisions that I don't understand.
320.5,321.5, Yeah.
321.5,323.5, I totally agree.
323.5,327.5, It's like it's as if they just ignore the general tendency of like what makes a game fun.
327.5,330.5," Plus they assume I have an HT TV, which is a horrible."
330.5,331.5," Oh, that's I've heard that about that."
331.5,333.5, That the print is super tiny.
333.5,334.5, Yeah.
334.5,335.5, It's my.
335.5,336.5, I have to like lean in really close to my television.
336.5,337.5, Yeah.
337.5,339.5, I know that's I was noticing that too.
339.5,342.5," While I was on the road, I was trying to go to my quick zombie,"
342.5,345.5, killing fix in and they had a standard FTV when I was playing it.
345.5,349.5," And like I had to really like I was sitting right in front of the TV basically like,"
349.5,350.5, No.
350.5,352.5, Are we ever getting a PC port at the skin though?
352.5,353.5, No.
353.5,354.5, I doubt it.
354.5,355.5, Damn it.
355.5,356.5, Enough of that one.
356.5,357.5, All right.
357.5,358.5, Yeah.
358.5,359.5, Then forget it.
359.5,361.5, Screw it.
361.5,362.5, No more.
362.5,363.5, Not interested.
363.5,364.5, No more promotion.
364.5,365.5, Yeah.
365.5,366.5, Screw dead rising.
366.5,368.5, That's what CDWS to say.
368.5,369.5, Yeah.
369.5,372.5," So, did we say go to hell?"
372.5,376.5," So, Darren, you alluded to the fact that you're at the Penny Arcade Expo."
376.5,377.5, Yeah.
377.5,381.5, Tell the fine folks and us actually what happened there.
381.5,382.5, Okay.
382.5,385.5," Well, for the full first of all, for those of you who aren't familiar with what it is, it's basically,"
385.5,390.5," well, to convention around Penny Arcade, the online comics web tune, comic strip, whatever."
390.5,392.5, And it started off a couple of years ago.
392.5,394.5," It's just kind of a small community get together,"
394.5,396.5, and it's kind of a big deal for the fans of the site.
396.5,399.5, It's kind of grown into more of a gamer centric.
399.5,404.5," I wouldn't say an E3, but it's certainly more of a, it's kind of more, a much more polished event."
404.5,405.5, It's kind of turned into a big deal.
405.5,406.5, It is.
406.5,409.5, It's sort of an amazing success story for those of us.
409.5,410.5, Absolutely.
410.5,415.5," And I think the thing that I, I was thinking over this weekend as I was going through the,"
415.5,421.5," through Penny Arcade Expo was that, you know, E3, you know, while fun for us and some,"
421.5,424.5," basically, it's like, it lost the message."
424.5,428.5," And we, and it became this, you know, it was all about the booth babes in that,"
428.5,432.5," and whoever had the loudest booth in the most of not just dancers and, like, whatever."
432.5,436.5," And this thing, all the, all the volume was turned down, it was just a bunch of,"
436.5,440.5," it was like, conventions that are packed with people who were just normal and like playing games."
440.5,442.5, There was no attitudes.
442.5,444.5," Well, because they were, it's aimed at gamers, right?"
444.5,446.5," Yeah, it's supposed to retailers."
446.5,449.5," I've never thought of it, so it's like, it's like, for once, I felt like I could, like,"
449.5,452.5," unleash the energy, can not worry about all the bullshit I deal with normal,"
452.5,453.5, a few things.
453.5,460.5," And, and quite honestly, like, I went to this thing and I reminded me of, like, why I love what I do."
460.5,461.5, That's cool.
461.5,462.5, That's good.
462.5,465.5," Because I mean, like, you know, I'm not going to get into too much of the office politics."
465.5,468.5," You stuff right now, but we got to have a week last week,"
468.5,469.5, and we had a week last week internally.
469.5,474.5, And I wrote a really fiery column in honor of that.
474.5,477.5," So, like, there, there are people who've pissed me off in this industry,"
477.5,481.5," and I keep thinking, like, what the hell's wrong with people, but then I go to some like packs and"
481.5,484.5," it reminds me of, you know, it's about the games."
484.5,486.5, Maybe take a little brush you back.
486.5,487.5, That's right.
487.5,488.5," Thank you, Gavin Tyco."
488.5,489.5, You've been making business in bastards.
489.5,490.5, I love them.
490.5,491.5, Yeah.
491.5,492.5, They're great.
492.5,494.5, Didn't you get them to sign your Nintendo DS?
494.5,495.5," Yes, I did."
495.5,496.5, You did.
496.5,497.5, Awesome.
497.5,498.5, How did you get them to the other party?
498.5,499.5," Yeah, I was just kind of goofed around."
499.5,500.5," I'm like, you know what, what the hell?"
500.5,501.5," Yeah, I'm kind of jealous."
501.5,503.5," Did they draw a little drawing on it, too?"
503.5,504.5," Uh, there was no one on the phone."
504.5,507.5," No, I hear they don't look like they're cartoon characters."
507.5,508.5, What?
508.5,509.5," Oh, no, no, no, no."
509.5,510.5, Sorry.
510.5,511.5," Uh, okay."
511.5,513.5," So, onto the actual convention itself."
513.5,517.5," Um, let me see, during the big announcements during it, is that, well, one,"
517.5,520.5," they're, they're, they're making a game, or I should say, they've worked with"
520.5,521.5, Hothead games.
521.5,523.5," Newcombo, but I don't get to that at the second, but the name of the game,"
523.5,529.5," in typical Penny Arcade fashion is called, on the Rainslick precipice of darkness episode one."
529.5,530.5, Awesome.
530.5,531.5, Yeah.
531.5,532.5, That's a mouthful.
533.5,536.5, On the Rainslick precipice of darkness.
536.5,537.5, Yes.
537.5,540.5," And I'm actually, you can't, you can't see this, but I'm holding up a picture right now."
540.5,542.5, They handed out these little announcement cards.
542.5,544.5, It's going to be Rainslick.
544.5,545.5, No.
545.5,546.5, What?
546.5,547.5, What?
547.5,548.5, It should be Rainslick.
548.5,549.5," All right, let me see it again."
549.5,550.5," Okay, here you go."
550.5,551.5, The Rainslick.
551.5,552.5," Oh, I get it."
552.5,553.5, I get it.
553.5,554.5, Okay.
554.5,555.5, I get it.
555.5,556.5, Yay.
556.5,558.5," So, do we know what it is?"
558.5,559.5, I do it.
559.5,560.5, Put them on the box.
560.5,563.5," They can't go when I'm up, up, up above my head."
563.5,564.5, What do we know about this?
564.5,573.5," Well, okay, so first of all, about the, the guys that formed hothead or former radical studios at EA guys from Vancouver, okay."
573.5,576.5," So basically, these are guys who worked on the Simpsons Hitten Run game and the,"
576.5,577.5, A fine game.
577.5,580.5," Yes, and the Hulk ultimate rampage game."
580.5,581.5," The second, Hulk."
581.5,582.5," Oh, that was good, too."
582.5,583.5, Exactly.
583.5,586.5," So these guys have, you know, good pedigree there and I'm definitely psyched with."
586.5,587.5, They're trying to do.
588.5,589.5, They're trying to do the game.
589.5,595.5," And they haven't really talked, they can keep it in cards really close right now, but I talked to Steve Bosch Box at."
595.5,601.5," BOC, SCA, him and Jolde Young, the two guys basically running the project."
601.5,610.5," And it's so early on, they want to make sure they make a game that's not going to just kind of focus on penny arcade fans like someone doesn't know the penny arcade comics."
610.5,613.5, So it's a deep and tight go in this game.
613.5,614.5, There are characters.
615.5,621.5," They're really, they're the traffic are always to incorporate everything they want to incorporate from the penny arcade universe."
621.5,624.5, Kind of it's kind of interesting that that's happening.
624.5,630.5," I mean, I mean, because they do, they count as as journalists."
630.5,633.5," I'm not trying to, I don't want to get into some weird."
633.5,634.5, That's a new game.
634.5,636.5," Yeah, whatever, but."
636.5,639.5," Well, no, it's, you know, it's actually a really fascinating question."
639.5,642.5," You're right, because I mean, these guys are, they're, they're, they're commentators."
642.5,643.5, They're gaming.
643.5,644.5, That's what I'm trying to say.
644.5,647.5," They comment, they commentate on the industry and now they're going to be in a game."
647.5,650.5," It says if we were characters in a game, God forbid."
650.5,655.5," And the funny thing is, I, I, one, I interviewed them a few, I guess was six months ago."
655.5,659.5," We, we ran into the CW interview in the magazine and I asked them, it's a very question."
659.5,664.5, And they actually said that it would be kind of surreal having a game about themselves.
664.5,667.5," And I, I kind of want to go back now and revisit that question with them."
667.5,668.5, Yeah.
668.5,670.5, The bet it's surreal.
670.5,675.5," And also, like, you know, they don't want to try to, like, kind of step over that line, but I guess if they do it right."
675.5,678.5, Is it going to be like a parody of a game you think?
678.5,684.5," Just because they're known for their humor and just kind of making fun of everything or I can only, I can only speculate on the truth."
684.5,686.5," They, they, they sarcastic bent to it."
686.5,687.5, Yeah.
687.5,688.5, Yeah.
688.5,689.5," Well, I expect no less."
689.5,692.5," I think they're, like, they're actually like, because they're so close."
692.5,698.5," No, they're in Seattle and, and, and, and, uh, hotheads base out of Vancouver, they're actually going back and forth a lot."
698.5,701.5, They're spending time just kind of putting together the plot and the script and stuff like that.
701.5,704.5, I guess that dark mella drama really wouldn't really win it fit.
704.5,705.5, Yeah.
705.5,706.5, Yeah.
706.5,711.5, The brooding guy on the rooftop trying to save the world was so sad when Tyco died.
711.5,712.5, Yeah.
712.5,713.5, You never know.
713.5,714.5, I guess not.
714.5,715.5, Okay.
715.5,717.5," So, uh, other, other things that came out of the, yeah."
717.5,718.5, Yeah.
718.5,719.5, It's all smart about packs.
719.5,720.5, More packs. Okay.
720.5,724.5," So they actually announced that, you know, you know, how Penny Arcade is known for doing charity, various, various, various, various, various things."
724.5,725.5, Right.
725.5,733.5," So they are starting up a, a, a fund, I guess, basically a scholarship for people who want to go to school to learn how to make games."
733.5,737.5," They actually are going to, I guess, a $10,000 scholarship."
737.5,738.5, Hmm.
738.5,741.5, Do they have scholarships for people who want to go to school and just play games?
741.5,743.5," Uh, or do you have a good one of them?"
743.5,745.5," I think, yeah."
745.5,748.5, I could have used that back and when I went to college.
748.5,750.5," Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm still a different 40s."
750.5,754.5," I'm still looking for the scholarship, like, it'll pay me a drink and,"
755.5,759.5," So, okay. So, is it first specific? I game design schools or,"
759.5,765.5," Well, actually, I mean, it'll obviously apply to game design schools, but I think they're still kind of working out the specifics on it."
765.5,774.5," But the general idea is if you have the intention of going through school and then afterwards going to make games, they, they would kick money your way."
774.5,775.5, Huh.
775.5,783.5," It's cool how like, enough time has gone on now that like, the idea of going to college to learn how to make games now isn't, isn't too far fast."
783.5,787.5," It's not really a joke. Right. I mean, there's film schools all over the country."
787.5,790.5, And now it's like such a big business. It totally makes sense.
790.5,796.5," Yeah. I mean, I just remember like, when I was, you know, remember the old, there's an old far side cartoon from years ago about like some parents reading the paper."
796.5,799.5," Like with the one and the one, I was looking for someone who plays games professional."
799.5,800.5, Right.
800.5,802.5," And now it's, it's actually kind of real."
802.5,803.5," Yeah, it is."
803.5,807.5, Yeah. There's some serious specialized skills that you need to make these things these days.
807.5,808.5," So, that's surprising at all."
808.5,810.5," Just like there are those for games, journal."
810.5,814.5," It's a very specialized skill sets for us such as,"
814.5,818.5," Anyway, what else happened at that?"
818.5,829.5," Okay. Just two, two quick things. One was alive, alive RPG of, and I guess, for a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, if you will, for me."
829.5,833.5," Well, it wasn't like, wasn't doing stress and up and saying fireball fireball."
833.5,836.5," I think we'll, saving throw."
836.5,838.5, Not that we all know what that would be like.
838.5,839.5," Oh, not it all."
839.5,840.5, Never done that.
840.5,842.5," No, but like the, the, it was for Guild Wars."
842.5,845.5," Basically, I have this competition throughout the show, like, you know, solving, like,"
845.5,849.5," like pseudo-cool like puzzles, target shooting."
849.5,851.5," You know, cool little things like that is actually,"
851.5,853.5," If you do pseudo-cool and Guild Wars, Ryan."
853.5,855.5," Well, no, I don't recall ever."
855.5,856.5," Well, I don't remember."
856.5,857.5," Well, I don't remember."
857.5,858.5, I don't remember.
858.5,859.5, It was a very loose translation.
859.5,860.5, It wasn't like that.
860.5,861.5," I see, okay."
861.5,862.5, Yeah.
862.5,863.5, Where the hell did that come from?
863.5,864.5, What?
864.5,865.5," There's no, there's no, there's no, there's no."
865.5,866.5," Why, no, where it came from?"
867.5,870.5," I mean, I, it came from Japan in 1940."
870.5,872.5," I mean, why all of a sudden now?"
872.5,874.5, Why I was on a plane the other day.
874.5,876.5, I have to plane was doing pseudo-cool puzzles.
876.5,877.5, It was weird.
877.5,879.5, It was like some freaky virus.
879.5,884.5, I remember when I was in London last year when I was in the cover story for an
884.5,885.5," animator, it's already."
885.5,886.5, Yeah.
886.5,888.5, And that was really before I kind of hit in the States and everyone there.
888.5,890.5," It's, it really is like a virus coming in."
890.5,891.5, It's weird.
891.5,892.5, It's weird.
892.5,894.5, It's because the jungle has gotten lazy.
895.5,896.5, Yeah.
896.5,897.5, Yeah.
897.5,900.5," When they're doing vumbels of four letter words, you know, yeah."
900.5,901.5," Cat, cat, yeah."
901.5,902.5, TCA.
902.5,904.5, Come on now.
904.5,906.5, Because crossword is for bitches.
906.5,908.5, I've done pseudo-cools a few times.
908.5,910.5," It's just, I don't know."
910.5,911.5, One.
911.5,913.5," You're a, you're a pseudo-cool person?"
913.5,914.5, Yes.
914.5,916.5, I was briefly addicted for a very short amount of time.
916.5,920.5, Till I like learn the pattern that I always tried and then I got bored of it.
920.5,922.5," Like, because once I kind of said, okay, and this is the rule set."
922.5,925.5," But no, I figured out what I need to try to figure out."
925.5,929.5," It was like a, I'm just applying this rule set."
929.5,935.5, I tried playing the PSP version and then I just had this like real bout of existential eggs.
935.5,941.5," You know, what the hell am I, I got this fancy fancy machine that I'm playing this dumbass game on?"
941.5,942.5, I don't know.
942.5,944.5, And then I just want back to luminous.
944.5,946.5, So this is the issue.
946.5,948.5," How do we get, I'm sorry."
948.5,949.5, I got way off on a tan.
949.5,951.5," It's Guild Wars, l sleeping and all right."
951.5,953.5," I'm sorry, Darren."
953.5,954.5, That's okay.
954.5,955.5, I was afraid.
955.5,956.5, It was crazy.
956.5,958.5, I was afraid.
958.5,959.5, I was afraid.
959.5,960.5," No, I was afraid."
960.5,961.5," Unless, but at least I just talk about the Omega Fenderly Quick."
961.5,962.5, It's kind of okay.
962.5,964.5," It's kind of a, it's a, it's a caffelon of gaming that they have every year."
964.5,969.5," And this time around, it's, okay, started off with a dice game called dice land."
969.5,971.5," I have no idea what that's about, missed it."
971.5,972.5, Okay.
972.5,974.5, Then round two is geometry wars.
974.5,978.0, I'm not sure what you're
978.0,979.0, high score.
979.0,982.0," Uh, 470."
982.0,983.5, That was good.
983.5,985.5," I got close to a million, but then I got"
985.5,986.5, another good yet.
986.5,988.0, Okay.
988.0,990.0," Anyway, this was it."
990.0,992.0, I don't have a next box 360.
992.0,994.5, So I can't play Dama two hours or shame.
994.5,996.4, And now maybe you can put
996.4,997.5, cigarette goods in with people
997.5,998.5, Microsoft.
998.5,999.0, Yeah.
999.0,999.5, Microsoft.
999.5,1001.0, He's a 360.
1001.0,1003.0, Can't afford it.
1003.0,1004.0, wife mad.
1004.0,1007.0, All right.
1007.0,1009.0, Let me see.
1009.0,1010.0, So what okay.
1010.0,1011.0, So the next round was Quake 3.
1011.0,1012.0, Okay.
1012.0,1013.0, I real modern game.
1013.0,1015.0, So this was a what at the cath on.
1015.0,1016.0," You said, well, it's kind of like a"
1016.0,1017.0, cath on it.
1017.0,1018.0," It ultimately the prizes for like, you know,"
1018.0,1020.0," I think last year it was this,"
1020.0,1022.0," like a collection, like basically every game"
1022.0,1024.0, and game system made to date.
1024.0,1026.0, Every pretty night.
1026.0,1028.0, It's some like ridiculous
1028.0,1029.0, collection.
1029.0,1030.0, I don't know what the prize was.
1030.0,1032.0, I actually had to leave a little early.
1032.0,1033.0, But okay.
1033.0,1035.0, Probably not every game ever made.
1035.0,1036.0," Well, better."
1036.0,1037.0," I mean, it was like, well, I was surprised"
1037.0,1038.0, with something like that.
1038.0,1039.0," I remember saying, picture of the stack."
1039.0,1040.0, It was really good.
1040.0,1043.0," It was like, it was like inside a cage in the middle of"
1043.0,1045.0," the, the, the, the, the hall."
1045.0,1047.0, It was this huge stack of stuff.
1047.0,1049.0, But even like every game.
1049.0,1050.0," But yeah, not."
1050.0,1051.0, It was a lot.
1051.0,1052.0, Yeah.
1052.0,1054.0, It certainly was a comprehensive collection.
1054.0,1056.0, It's quite a bit like test drive 12.
1056.0,1058.0," I mean, you know, every every lame."
1058.0,1059.0, I think it was console.
1059.0,1060.0, Okay.
1060.0,1061.0, All right.
1061.0,1062.0, God.
1062.0,1063.0, Geez.
1063.0,1064.0, Much of freaking stickless.
1064.0,1065.0, Sorry.
1065.0,1068.0, I'm still mad about losing the first podcast.
1068.0,1070.0," That's just, that's just, okay."
1070.0,1071.0, Okay.
1071.0,1073.0," Next round was guitar hero, which was I sat on that one."
1073.0,1075.0, That was fun to watch.
1075.0,1076.0, And let me see.
1076.0,1079.0, The last one was kind of the second last one was kind of fun
1079.0,1081.0, as well as Mario Kart double dash.
1081.0,1083.0, So that is like a bunch of people like with DS
1083.0,1087.0, just kind of lined up in a tense competition.
1087.0,1089.0," And the last round, the one I had to leave in the middle of,"
1089.0,1091.0, could take to catch a flight.
1091.0,1095.0," Um, then 10 over version of Tetris."
1095.0,1097.0, Any off any as 10 original.
1097.0,1099.0, Any of those versus versus mode.
1099.0,1100.0, It was the 10 get one.
1100.0,1101.0, Okay.
1101.0,1102.0, That's.
1102.0,1104.0," And you would have won if you hadn't had to leave for the flight, right?"
1104.0,1105.0, Yeah.
1105.0,1108.0," So I would have, I would have stuck around for the weather."
1108.0,1109.0, I've been checking out.
1109.0,1110.0, I haven't checked the boards yet this morning.
1110.0,1113.0," But it was, that's pretty cool."
1113.0,1114.0, It's really fun.
1114.0,1116.0, It's just like the whole weekend is kind of like that.
1116.0,1118.0," So it's like fun, happy gaming weekend."
1118.0,1119.0, Pretty much.
1119.0,1122.0, And the thing is there is also like demos of new games and stuff like that.
1122.0,1124.0, They had pirates to the burning sea was there.
1124.0,1126.0, It's game called Fury.
1126.0,1130.0," Um, and I guess the part that I really appreciate was it's like they're doing their thing."
1130.0,1132.0," And they have the, all the volume was just low."
1132.0,1133.0," No, no."
1133.0,1135.0," I don't, I'm a deafened, no heart."
1135.0,1137.0," No, no hard sales pitch."
1137.0,1140.0," Oh, actually there was a hard sales pitch from the America's Army game."
1140.0,1141.0," Oh, really."
1141.0,1142.0, They had a shooting range.
1142.0,1144.0," You know, with a, you know, the game shooting range."
1144.0,1147.0, And then they had a recruiter is basically a game talk.
1147.0,1148.0, It's all kind of people.
1148.0,1151.0," So like they would say, hey, you want to try out this game."
1151.0,1153.0," Want to come around and they would hand you the, you know,"
1153.0,1156.0," I'm interested in in listing form kind of,"
1156.0,1157.0," or like, never, I'm like, like, postcards."
1157.0,1160.0," I want, I want more information about it and joining the Army."
1160.0,1161.0, Uh-huh.
1161.0,1162.0," Well, I guess that kind of makes sense."
1162.0,1163.0, I'm going to make sense.
1163.0,1164.0, I'm not going to look in for more people.
1164.0,1165.0, I'm going to give him crap.
1165.0,1167.0," I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, at least they're being honest."
1167.0,1168.0, Right.
1168.0,1169.0, Right.
1169.0,1171.0," Hey, they're going where the, you know, where the,"
1171.0,1174.0," the males of that age are, right?"
1174.0,1175.0, They're just playing video game.
1175.0,1176.0," I, I just thought it was kind of funny."
1176.0,1179.0," I mean, like, I know that I look my age, you know, 30ish."
1179.0,1180.0, Mm-hmm.
1180.0,1181.0, So they didn't try to recruit you?
1181.0,1184.0," No, I actually, there's a totally different approach."
1184.0,1186.0," The guy took with me as opposed to the, the, the, the, the, the, the,"
1186.0,1189.0, 18 and the 19 year olds that were walking up and wanting to get a couple shots.
1189.0,1190.0, Uh-huh.
1190.0,1191.0, Uh-huh.
1191.0,1192.0, Uh-huh.
1192.0,1193.0," Actually, that you just reminded me of this time I was on, uh,"
1193.0,1197.0," I was on Bart and I was wearing my old motorcycloputes, uh,"
1197.0,1200.0," which were just sort of like, you know, they looked like"
1200.0,1204.0," military boats and this, there were these two, uh, pretty cute young women sitting at"
1204.0,1208.0," near me and they were talking and then they looked over at me and they said,"
1208.0,1209.0," Hey, we just had a bet."
1209.0,1213.0, We are wondering if you had those when you used to be in the army.
1213.0,1215.0," And that, and what made me laugh was there."
1215.0,1219.0, Used to be in the army because clearly I was too old to actually still be in the army.
1219.0,1220.0, That's right.
1220.0,1221.0, Starting to green and it's hard.
1221.0,1225.0," No, it's, you were, back in the Korean war when I was,"
1225.0,1226.0, Yeah.
1226.0,1228.0," And we'll go back when you were fighting the, uh,"
1228.0,1230.0," the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,"
1230.0,1231.0, The never won.
1231.0,1232.0, What did you say to them?
1232.0,1233.0, The nazis.
1233.0,1236.0," Um, I said shut up you damn kids."
1236.0,1238.0, You can't get off my lawn.
1238.0,1239.0, Get off my lawn.
1239.0,1240.0, Yeah.
1240.0,1244.0," Uh, so here on our list of, uh, our list of topics,"
1244.0,1246.0," there's a thing that says, uh, you know, I'll just actually read it."
1246.0,1249.0," So it's not really PC gaming, but holy crap."
1249.0,1253.0," You can, you can download a full TV show over Xbox live."
1253.0,1256.0," Battle Star Galactica, the story so far."
1256.0,1260.0, And that appeals to me because I am fully on the Battle Star Galactica bandwagon now.
1260.0,1262.0, So tell us what this means.
1262.0,1263.0, This means.
1263.0,1264.0, And is there any PC relation?
1264.0,1266.0," There, there is no PC relation whatsoever."
1266.0,1267.0, Damn it.
1267.0,1270.0," Sadly no, but it on Xbox live."
1270.0,1272.0," You can download the 500, it's a 500 bank file."
1272.0,1275.0," And it's, it's, it's a two hour show."
1275.0,1276.0, You can watch it.
1276.0,1277.0," Um, oh, wait."
1277.0,1280.0, So it's not the seasons of Battle Star Galactica.
1280.0,1281.0," Is it like a,"
1281.0,1283.0, It's kind of like the story perspective episode.
1283.0,1286.0, So it's a catch up thing for everything that's happened in this show.
1286.0,1287.0, Wow.
1287.0,1288.0, Did they make it?
1288.0,1289.0, Just for Xbox live.
1289.0,1290.0, I don't know.
1290.0,1291.0, I just cut a saw before.
1291.0,1292.0, Is it free?
1292.0,1293.0, So it's totally free.
1293.0,1294.0, Wait.
1294.0,1295.0, So is this the equivalent of those dumb lost clip?
1295.0,1297.0, It might be.
1297.0,1299.0, For some people who haven't seen all of the shows.
1299.0,1301.0, I know like Sean Elliott hasn't seen them all.
1301.0,1304.0," And of course, once again, we're, we're talking about Xbox stuff."
1304.0,1305.0, Yeah.
1305.0,1307.0," Social Xbox podcast, apparently."
1307.0,1308.0, Okay.
1308.0,1310.0," Well, you do have news coming up next."
1310.0,1311.0, That is more PC related thing.
1311.0,1315.0, And download every single episode of Battle Star Galactica on your PC.
1315.0,1316.0, Yes.
1316.0,1318.0, Through iTunes or a bit torrented.
1318.0,1319.0," I mean, right now."
1319.0,1320.0," I mean, I mean, I mean not."
1320.0,1323.0," When I said iTunes, which is Apple, you suck."
1323.0,1324.0, But it's true.
1324.0,1327.0, This podcast is a music store complete disaster.
1327.0,1329.0, The original one was awesome.
1329.0,1331.0, We're having identity problem.
1331.0,1332.0, We really are.
1332.0,1335.0, Let's put a big thing up on the wall here.
1335.0,1336.0, PC.
1336.0,1338.0, Computer gaming world.
1338.0,1340.0, Or nevermind.
1340.0,1341.0, But actually we can.
1341.0,1342.0, We can.
1342.0,1343.0, Computers.
1343.0,1344.0, All right.
1344.0,1345.0, That's what Sony says.
1345.0,1346.0, Yeah.
1346.0,1347.0, Did you say that?
1347.0,1348.0," Well, what is Sony say?"
1348.0,1350.0, Consoles are Compiously as a computer faster.
1350.0,1351.0, Okay.
1351.0,1356.0, Let's talk about something very specific to PCs and Microsoft.
1356.0,1358.0, Our new lords and masters.
1358.0,1361.0," And that would be the, that would be the Vista price."
1361.0,1365.0," Which came out, which we're now told maybe through somebody at Microsoft that these"
1365.0,1368.0, prices that got announced may in fact be the Canadian prices.
1369.0,1373.0, And since we know how screwed up Canada is that this might have absolutely no relation
1373.0,1374.0, to us whatsoever.
1374.0,1376.0," And anyway, and I kid Canada."
1376.0,1377.0, That's right.
1377.0,1381.0," Because it says here, cost two bottles of beer for the Mr."
1381.0,1383.0, That's nice.
1383.0,1384.0, And a moose.
1384.0,1385.0, Subbottles and the moose.
1385.0,1387.0, And a dog's lens.
1387.0,1388.0, We kid.
1388.0,1390.0, Let's call this to ultimate.
1390.0,1391.0, All right.
1391.0,1392.0, So we've got.
1392.0,1397.0, We've got all sorts of all sorts of pricing for the full version of the
1398.0,1402.0, Vista starting with the home basic at 233.
1402.0,1405.0," Well, dollars potentially Canadian dollars."
1405.0,1407.0, And actually Canadian dollars.
1407.0,1408.0, These are these right.
1408.0,1412.0, Going all the way up to Vista ultimate at $450.
1412.0,1414.0, Looney is even.
1414.0,1418.0, Looney is so it got from basic 233 premium.
1418.0,1424.0, 269 business 341 and ultimate for 50.
1425.0,1430.0, That's a pretty big jump from the basic of 233 to the ultimate for 450.
1430.0,1435.0," They kind of going from this pricing model to me looks kind of like somewhere between what they do with like,"
1435.0,1437.0," you know, cable subscriptions."
1437.0,1438.0," Yeah, yeah."
1438.0,1439.0, And what they sold.
1439.0,1440.0," Yeah, exactly."
1440.0,1444.0," And then there's the, I guess the analogy with like what they did with the Xbox 360."
1444.0,1445.0, Right.
1445.0,1449.0, So what's what do you think you're going to get in ultimate that you didn't get in basic?
1449.0,1453.0, That like someone who just is a gamer uses their PC basically for that.
1453.0,1455.0," My, my, my bit."
1455.0,1459.0," I mean, I'm just operating off the name is right here."
1459.0,1460.0, But if I would have break it down.
1460.0,1462.0, To basically we know nothing.
1462.0,1463.0, That's our disclaimer.
1463.0,1464.0, That's pretty exactly.
1464.0,1465.0," Well, exactly."
1465.0,1466.0, It's a CGW here.
1466.0,1468.0," As if we, as if we know anything ever."
1468.0,1469.0, Right.
1469.0,1473.0," But I mean, I say the prime of the premium one is going to have like the gaming centric stuff people actually care about."
1473.0,1474.0, Like what?
1474.0,1478.0," You know, the optimizations and the wind sat, you know,"
1478.0,1480.0," tool that's working in the background,"
1480.0,1484.0," you know, you're gaming performances the best, but like the ultimate upgrades probably going to like, you know,"
1484.0,1487.0," garage band or, you know, the equivalent of this kind of video editing stuff."
1487.0,1495.0," But actually we should say here, we also have prices for the upgrades, which we're assuming are going to be right from XP from XP."
1495.0,1505.0," A home basic upgrade, 116 dollars premium one, 179 business to 24 ultimate upgrade to 69."
1505.0,1509.0," So the cheapest you could actually go here is a hundred, 16 dollars."
1509.0,1517.0," If you already have XP and you just want to upgrade to the most basic VISTA, at least these numbers now that we have that could be Canadian."
1517.0,1518.0, Right.
1518.0,1522.0," Yeah, and that was actually, Microsoft was reach for comment."
1522.0,1525.0," They said they declined, but the, you know,"
1525.0,1530.0," the, the, the, the information was pulled from the Microsoft Canadian retail page."
1530.0,1534.0," So that's, that's all, that's all we have to go on right now."
1534.0,1535.0, Which isn't a lot.
1535.0,1536.0, Exactly.
1536.0,1538.0," Very little, but it's just some sort of one topic that was actually about the capacity."
1538.0,1540.0, So we're going to sketchy.
1540.0,1542.0, When did XP come out?
1542.0,1544.0, Does anybody remember?
1544.0,1546.0," I want to say,"
1546.0,1548.0," Let's see, there was one as two."
1548.0,1550.0," Well, I want to say like 2002."
1550.0,1552.0," No, this is our least prepared."
1552.0,1554.0, And we not know this stuff.
1554.0,1555.0, Really.
1555.0,1565.0," I remember all of the, I remember getting an OEM copy of Windows XP with them, a bunch of new PC hardware in 2002 for like $89."
1566.0,1568.0, And it was the full version.
1568.0,1569.0, Wasn't like an upgrade or anything.
1569.0,1575.0," I think it's fairly safe to say we're going to have to keep, we're going to have to keep talking about this because obviously it's a big deal when people should upgrade."
1575.0,1578.0, I don't think I upgraded to XP right away.
1578.0,1579.0, I think I waited.
1579.0,1580.0, I usually wait.
1580.0,1582.0, I get scared of a waiters.
1582.0,1584.0," I just don't, I don't want to do it."
1584.0,1586.0," And then find out, you know, my stuff doesn't work."
1586.0,1587.0, Right.
1587.0,1590.0, I need to see other people like be screwed first.
1590.0,1594.0," And then after, and they test the waters, they get their PCs host."
1594.0,1597.0," Well, I, six months after that, I have to have things patched and ready for it."
1597.0,1602.0," I usually time my, my OS updates with when I need a new computer."
1602.0,1603.0," Yeah, I do that too."
1603.0,1607.0," So basically, I, I basically tell people to hold off as long as possible."
1607.0,1609.0, I'm buying a new computer and like a couple of issues ago.
1609.0,1612.0, We ran that feature on how to build a seven or a lot of PC.
1612.0,1613.0, Right.
1613.0,1617.0," That's the kind of thing I would do until Mr. came out and then see what needs to, what needs to happen."
1617.0,1620.0, I just don't really want to upgrade until I know I need to.
1620.0,1626.0," You know, if, if the games are taking advantage of VISTA and they run just fine on XP,"
1626.0,1629.0, I then I don't want to spend the money for a new one.
1629.0,1635.0," You know, unless I'm really told that there's something I'm gaining from VISTA that really matters to me."
1635.0,1638.0," Yeah, I think it took me a long time to get the XP."
1638.0,1640.0," I remember right, but I don't."
1640.0,1641.0, It's blur.
1641.0,1642.0, Yeah.
1642.0,1643.0, I actually really like it to say.
1643.0,1644.0, I see how that's grown.
1644.0,1646.0, I went from 98 to XP.
1646.0,1647.0, Ooh.
1648.0,1650.0," I actually, I skipped 2000."
1650.0,1651.0, Yeah.
1651.0,1652.0, I used 2000.
1652.0,1655.0," I have the misfortune of using ME as well, though."
1655.0,1656.0, Yeah.
1656.0,1657.0, That's.
1657.0,1659.0, That is good as MS bomb before.
1659.0,1660.0, But mama.
1660.0,1664.0, I do want to I do want to find out the original XP pricing structure just to see.
1664.0,1670.0," Because when you look at these numbers here, just on paper here, the most basic, like say you're not upgrading."
1670.0,1673.0, Buy in a new PC with your first operating system.
1673.0,1674.0, 233 dollars.
1674.0,1675.0, Right.
1675.0,1676.0, Seems like a lot.
1676.0,1677.0, Right.
1677.0,1678.0, I can't remember if I can't find it.
1678.0,1680.0, I think it's around 200ish.
1680.0,1681.0, Was it?
1681.0,1682.0, Yeah.
1682.0,1684.0, I don't think it's too pricey as too far off from what it's been.
1684.0,1686.0," Most of the time, it bundled in with a new PC."
1686.0,1687.0, Wow.
1687.0,1689.0," Because a lot of people, you know, go delirutor whatever."
1689.0,1690.0, Right.
1690.0,1691.0, So.
1691.0,1693.0," I mean, the number that sticks out for me is that far 50."
1693.0,1694.0, Yeah.
1694.0,1695.0, It's pretty glaring.
1695.0,1696.0, I see that.
1696.0,1697.0, Yeah.
1697.0,1698.0, I can't ignore the rest of it.
1698.0,1699.0, That's a lot of money.
1699.0,1700.0, What I've got.
1700.0,1701.0, More than a 360.
1701.0,1702.0, Yeah.
1702.0,1703.0, More than a 360 console.
1703.0,1705.0," You know, what I find myself wondering though is if that's price includes, I don't know,"
1705.0,1707.0, if I can't find myself a sweet or something like that.
1707.0,1710.0," Well, that's the kind of information that we as journalists need to find out."
1710.0,1711.0, There you have it.
1711.0,1712.0, Because you're right.
1712.0,1716.0," But I bet, yeah, I'll bet you a dollar here on here right now."
1716.0,1719.0," That the, that's how certain I am of my,"
1719.0,1721.0, that you're convinced in my conviction.
1721.0,1722.0," I'll, I'll, I'll Canadian."
1722.0,1725.0," One, if the whole dollar Canadian is Canadian or Turkish."
1725.0,1726.0, Right.
1726.0,1730.0," That, that VISTA ultimate does not include the office sweet."
1730.0,1732.0," You know what, I'll take that action."
1732.0,1733.0, Really?
1733.0,1734.0, Okay.
1734.0,1735.0, That's why you're going to be a dollar.
1735.0,1736.0, I don't know why.
1736.0,1737.0, I'm here.
1737.0,1738.0, That's one dollar.
1738.0,1742.0, So you think it's the magic of radio.
1742.0,1744.0, It wasn't really a dollar.
1744.0,1745.0, Don't tell them.
1745.0,1746.0, Great.
1746.0,1748.0, It's a little bit of magic.
1748.0,1750.0, I think it's kind of down there for versions.
1750.0,1755.0," Well, I mean, there were two versions of, like, if you think about it, there was XP pro and XP home."
1755.0,1756.0, Yeah.
1756.0,1757.0, It's a two.
1757.0,1758.0, It's an opportunity to be in layers.
1758.0,1759.0, Yeah.
1759.0,1763.0," Well, and the pro would have been like VISTA business here, right?"
1763.0,1763.5, Yeah.
1763.5,1766.5, The weird ones here are like the home basic and then home pretty.
1766.5,1767.5, Yeah.
1767.5,1768.5," I mean, what's up with that?"
1768.5,1769.5, Just put it all together.
1769.5,1772.5, And then the premium is $30 more than the basic.
1772.5,1775.5," I mean, they have to do that seriously."
1775.5,1778.5, Just whatever it was in the premium.
1778.5,1780.5, Is there a porn browser in the premium one?
1780.5,1782.5," I mean, what is it going in?"
1782.5,1783.5," Oh, no."
1783.5,1784.5, No.
1784.5,1785.5, No.
1785.5,1786.5, Right.
1786.5,1787.5, That is a premium.
1787.5,1788.5, Why do they have a whole separate versions?
1788.5,1790.5, That's just $30 more.
1790.5,1791.5, That just seems stupid.
1791.5,1792.5, Okay.
1793.5,1794.5, Right.
1794.5,1795.5, You're right.
1795.5,1796.5, You don't even know if this is real.
1796.5,1797.5, Right.
1797.5,1800.5," So if I said anything bad to Microsoft, I'm sorry."
1800.5,1802.5, Let me do it.
1803.5,1804.5, Yeah.
1804.5,1805.5, Yeah.
1805.5,1808.5, We're all feeling the count bounce coming on to the new magazine.
1808.5,1810.5," It's not quite senior writers, but it's definitely something."
1810.5,1812.5, I think I have senior writers a little bit.
1812.5,1818.5," I sort of wanted to be games showing those magazine already, but yet, also kind of down."
1818.5,1819.5, Yeah.
1819.5,1820.5, I actually was talking.
1821.5,1826.5," I was talking to some developers this weekend and we all kind of had this like, I wouldn't say a teary moment over a beer, but we're just like,"
1826.5,1831.5, I think they're actually they're showing their memories because like these guys were reading the magazine for like 10 years or what the plus years.
1831.5,1837.5," Like, like, man, I remember this they're going back and forth talking about like some of their favorite articles and stuff of the years."
1837.5,1838.5, Yeah.
1838.5,1844.5," For the listeners at home, we're just starting working on the last CGW."
1844.5,1845.5, Right.
1845.5,1848.5, So that's why we're sort of in this frame of mind right now.
1848.5,1849.5, Yeah.
1849.5,1852.5, And actually putting together the contents for the last CGW.
1852.5,1859.5," And some kind of I guess, some bring or kind of I don't know what I'm looking for here, but basically it's a person's vacation."
1859.5,1860.5, Yes.
1860.5,1872.5," The 25 year anniversary months, a month of when we launched the magazine, the November issue that our last issue at CGW is going to be our 25 year anniversary."
1872.5,1873.5, Serendipitous.
1873.5,1874.5, There you go.
1874.5,1875.5, Thank you.
1875.5,1876.5, Serendipitous.
1876.5,1877.5, 25 years.
1877.5,1879.5, You're the last.
1879.5,1880.5, Not really our last though.
1880.5,1881.5," No, no."
1881.5,1882.5, It's a new beginning.
1882.5,1884.5," The next generation, if you will."
1884.5,1885.5, If you will.
1885.5,1887.5, And we will.
1887.5,1890.5, And we will.
1890.5,1891.5, How we had on time.
1891.5,1893.5, We got 31 minutes here.
1893.5,1894.5, 31 minutes.
1894.5,1896.5, Is this struggling long enough?
1896.5,1898.5, 31 minutes of nothing.
1898.5,1901.5," Nah, we've had our moments."
1901.5,1903.5, We also had five lost minutes.
1903.5,1904.5, Five great.
1904.5,1905.5, There was so awesome.
1906.5,1908.5, It was comedy genius.
1908.5,1911.5," Just insightful, witty remarks."
1911.5,1913.5, And you'll never hear them.
1913.5,1915.5," So I, but I do have some."
1915.5,1917.5, Read questions.
1917.5,1922.5," Uh, and should I ask any of these?"
1922.5,1924.5," Um, they're good."
1924.5,1926.5," Uh, they're all horrible."
1926.5,1928.5," No, there's some good ones here."
1928.5,1930.5," Um, let's see."
1930.5,1931.5," Well, like keep those questions coming."
1931.5,1934.5, We didn't get a chance to gift them all as many as we'd like to this week.
1934.5,1935.5, But next week definitely.
1935.5,1936.5," Yeah, definitely."
1936.5,1937.5," Please, keep the questions coming."
1937.5,1939.5, You guys ask great ones.
1939.5,1944.5, And we like to hear them and make fun of them behind your back.
1944.5,1947.5, Just kidding.
1947.5,1948.5," Uh, okay."
1948.5,1949.5, How about how about this one?
1949.5,1950.5," Uh, from Kyle,"
1950.5,1952.5," Aller, uh,"
1952.5,1953.5, Hodgick or Hagek.
1953.5,1956.5, I'm sorry for mispronouncing your name.
1956.5,1959.5," If I did, I love you anyway."
1959.5,1961.5," Uh, Kyle, that I come for now."
1961.5,1971.5," He asks, you guys think current games have the same ability to pull you back in a few years later that a decent number of old games have."
1971.5,1977.5," I know my X, come and Deus Ex Addictions still come back to hot to me, for example."
1977.5,1985.5," So in a way, sort of, asking us to predict the future sort of other games that we're playing now that we think are going to be the classics that we return to."
1985.5,1988.5," I know that for me, I certainly have games like that."
1988.5,1989.5, Here is a might magic.
1989.5,1991.5," Three, I go back to Diablo 2."
1991.5,1993.5, But is there anything out now that fall out?
1993.5,1998.5, But is there anything now that's going to have that same kind of kind of hard to tell?
1998.5,1999.5, Yeah.
1999.5,2000.5, But what do we think?
2000.5,2001.5, That's tough.
2001.5,2007.5," I mean, I, I, it's kind of hard to know if again, again, we'll really stand the test and time until you kind of separate a little from it."
2007.5,2008.5, Right.
2008.5,2011.5," I mean, if it has the timeless classic quality to it,"
2011.5,2015.5," maybe we'll go back to Half Life 2 at some point, you know, down the road and want to play it again."
2015.5,2017.5, I can see that maybe.
2017.5,2020.5, I kind of think Titan Quest might hold up for me over time.
2020.5,2021.5, Really?
2021.5,2023.5, Just in the same way that Diablo 2 does.
2023.5,2029.5," The first game that jumps to my mind, it's, it's not the most current game, but a, the 2004 Sid Myers Pirates."
2029.5,2030.5," Oh, yeah."
2030.5,2031.5, Yeah.
2031.5,2032.5, You know what?
2032.5,2033.5," That's a good one, Ryan."
2033.5,2034.5, Yeah.
2034.5,2035.5, It's nice to go back to old pirates.
2035.5,2038.5," It's kind of like civilization in that way, because like,"
2038.5,2041.5, I keep going back to the latest civilization no matter what it is.
2041.5,2042.5, Yeah.
2042.5,2043.5, That's right.
2043.5,2045.5," So, certainly the best way to go back to three."
2045.5,2046.5, And then I'm going to be really good.
2046.5,2047.5," So, I'm going to be really good."
2047.5,2048.5, But I'm going to be really good.
2048.5,2049.5, But that's a good one.
2049.5,2050.5, Yeah.
2050.5,2051.5, That's pretty good.
2051.5,2052.5, Yeah.
2052.5,2063.5," There's games at, every time when I weed through the pile, there's always some that I save as, like, yeah, I'll probably play this again in that mythical later time in my life when I have nothing to do but play games."
2063.5,2065.5, And I know that pirates made that cut.
2065.5,2067.5," Actually, no, again, that I think I've been thinking about it."
2067.5,2070.5," I want to go back and play Vampire, the Master Read Blundlands."
2070.5,2071.5, Really?
2071.5,2072.5, Isn't this the second one?
2072.5,2073.5," Not the source one, right?"
2074.5,2075.5, Okay.
2075.5,2076.5," The source one, right?"
2076.5,2077.5, Okay.
2077.5,2078.5, This one is based on Light Shreka.
2078.5,2079.5, Right.
2079.5,2080.5, I regret missing.
2080.5,2081.5, Really?
2081.5,2082.5, Yeah.
2082.5,2084.5," I guess I missed it too, actually."
2084.5,2085.5, I want to go back and play that one.
2085.5,2092.5," I remember that as Robert was playing it, I was kind of just trying to get into it and then I ran into some major bug issues."
2092.5,2095.5," And then they released this patch after the fact, and I never got back to it."
2095.5,2096.5, But I should.
2096.5,2102.5," Can you guys think of games on your hard drives right now that are, have, you know, past theirs, their expiration date."
2102.5,2106.5, But you have them because you keep thinking you're going to finish them.
2106.5,2107.5, I guess I can make up.
2107.5,2109.5," Well, I would say finish, but replay or replay."
2109.5,2110.5," Uh, Darwinian."
2110.5,2111.5, Okay.
2111.5,2113.5, That has permanent place of honor and plus just so damn small.
2113.5,2115.5, I have no excuse to get rid of it.
2115.5,2116.5, Okay.
2116.5,2117.5, No.
2117.5,2121.5," I don't, because they don't keep around the old ones because they think I can just three install them."
2121.5,2122.5," I have, I have sanded."
2122.5,2123.5, Don't try it on there.
2123.5,2124.5," Don't really use sanded, Andreas."
2124.5,2127.5," Never finished, but I don't want to delete it because I got so far in."
2127.5,2129.5," I'm pushed, but the hot coffee lot on there, so."
2130.5,2133.5," All right. You know what, still on my hard drive that I never have never finished."
2133.5,2135.5, It's Baldur's Kate too.
2135.5,2137.5, I've never finished I can.
2137.5,2138.5," I, you have no excuse."
2138.5,2140.5, It was only like two hours long.
2140.5,2141.5, Yeah.
2141.5,2142.5, Yeah.
2142.5,2145.5," You know, and actually, I can tell you, I'm going to keep a living on my hard drive."
2145.5,2146.5, Yeah.
2146.5,2147.5, So if I got all never beat it.
2147.5,2149.5," Yeah, I still have a living on there."
2149.5,2150.5, I haven't gone back to that one in a while.
2150.5,2152.5," I had to go, I had to go to the cold turkey."
2152.5,2155.5, Is that one's hard to pick up again after a break I've found?
2155.5,2157.5," So to far for me, it's hard to remember like all that."
2157.5,2158.5, What you're doing.
2158.5,2159.5, Not threads.
2159.5,2160.5, Yeah. What I was doing.
2160.5,2164.5," Well, the journal kind of covered that for you or it does."
2164.5,2165.5, But I don't want to.
2165.5,2167.5," If you're playing and you like stop for the night, you're like, I tomorrow."
2167.5,2169.5, I'm going to do this this and this.
2169.5,2170.5, Yeah.
2170.5,2171.5, You know what I really say.
2171.5,2173.5," How about you, Ryan?"
2173.5,2175.5, Freedom force.
2175.5,2176.5," Oh, that's a good answer."
2176.5,2178.5, That was not a good answer.
2178.5,2183.5," The first game I played through a bit of it that never, never finished."
2183.5,2186.5," You know, I never even played a third one."
2186.5,2187.5, I'm not sure if you're going to be a third.
2187.5,2188.5, I haven't.
2188.5,2189.5, I still haven't.
2189.5,2190.5, I'm sitting in my 2B played pile.
2190.5,2192.5, Is that because you're not as huge a fan of these silver age comics?
2192.5,2194.5," No, I am a fan of the silver age counts."
2194.5,2199.5," I think it just came out at a time when I just was busy playing other stuff, you know,"
2199.5,2201.5, as tends to happen.
2201.5,2205.5, I think I have almost all the black out games.
2205.5,2210.5," Now that I think about it in the 2B replayed pile, like torment, torment, torment, torment."
2210.5,2211.5, Yeah.
2211.5,2212.5, Yeah.
2212.5,2215.5," The original thought I've been wanting to play, I've been really hitting the play"
2215.5,2216.5, fall out again.
2216.5,2220.5," I do hope we get word on fall out three, some kind of scene."
2220.5,2221.5, Two.
2221.5,2222.5," Yeah, I'm just going to hear more about that one."
2222.5,2224.5, Hopefully we'll read about it first in our magazine.
2224.5,2225.5, Sure.
2225.5,2226.5, We're doing nice.
2226.5,2227.5, Yeah.
2227.5,2230.5," Here what I'm saying there Bethesda, we want to hear about it in our magazine."
2230.5,2231.5, We love you.
2231.5,2232.5, Bastards.
2232.5,2235.5," I was like, good."
2235.5,2236.5, Good job.
2236.5,2237.5, Bad.
2237.5,2238.5, I got the chance.
2238.5,2239.5, Yeah.
2239.5,2240.5, Good.
2241.5,2243.5, Let's see.
2243.5,2245.5, So we hit any other questions.
2245.5,2247.5, Let's end on a good one.
2247.5,2250.5, Do we have any good ones?
2250.5,2253.5, Do you see GW? Why are you so awesome?
2253.5,2255.5, Find Brian Scott.
2255.5,2256.5, Find Brian Scott.
2256.5,2257.5, Rodster.
2257.5,2258.5, Rodster.
2258.5,2260.5, When will you guys bring back Scorpio?
2260.5,2262.5, How is so afraid to ask questions?
2262.5,2263.5, You suck Ryan.
2263.5,2266.5, The answer is stop asking that question.
2266.5,2268.5," That's, yeah, that question comes up a lot."
2268.5,2269.5, When are you bringing back Scorpio?
2269.5,2272.5, Are we going to try to bring back Scorpio for the last issue?
2272.5,2273.5, What do you say boys?
2273.5,2274.5, You know what?
2274.5,2275.5, I say what the heck.
2275.5,2277.5, I wouldn't mind hearing from her for that last issue.
2277.5,2288.5, I will confess to all the listeners that I am actually trying to round up as many of the old school folks that we can to chime in on this very last issue.
2288.5,2291.5, So if that will include Scorpio.
2291.5,2294.5," So if you, Scorpio, if you're listening out there,"
2294.5,2297.5, we would love for you to chime in on our last issue.
2297.5,2300.5, We could put all our old differences aside.
2300.5,2304.5," We can hug, you know, metaphorically speaking in the magazine."
2304.5,2308.5," And anybody else out there have a Martin Ceruleus, the old,"
2308.5,2309.5, what's the deal with?
2309.5,2310.5, Thomas.
2310.5,2312.5, He's going to give you a course.
2312.5,2313.5, Martin Ceruleus.
2313.5,2314.5, Right. He does.
2314.5,2319.5, I would love to hear from all the old guard to chime in on the last CDW.
2319.5,2321.5, I think that would be fun.
2321.5,2323.5, Don't you?
2323.5,2324.5, I do.
2324.5,2325.5, I do.
2325.5,2326.5, George Jones.
2326.5,2327.5, My old boss.
2327.5,2328.5, Auditor and chief of CDW.
2328.5,2331.5," He doesn't, doesn't you work for the competition now?"
2331.5,2332.5, Does he?
2332.5,2333.5, He doesn't.
2333.5,2334.5, He doesn't.
2334.5,2336.5, He works for the competition now.
2336.5,2337.5, Does he?
2337.5,2338.5, He doesn't.
2338.5,2342.5," He can, he can, Elliot Chin, who's now at Sega."
2342.5,2346.5," There, we have a whole where are they now of CDW editors?"
2346.5,2348.5," A readable, who's who this is?"
2348.5,2349.5, He will be.
2349.5,2350.5, They've actually gone on to success.
2350.5,2351.5, Many of them.
2351.5,2352.5, Believe it or not.
2352.5,2357.5, So that's the answer to your question.
2357.5,2358.5, Will we bring Scarpy back?
2358.5,2361.5," If she wants to come back, it's the answer for us."
2361.5,2363.5, To be interviewed by Willo Neal.
2363.5,2364.5, Yeah.
2364.5,2365.5, Willo Neal.
2365.5,2366.5, There's another one to bring back.
2366.5,2367.5, That's right.
2367.5,2370.5," Yeah, but we'll not just have to watch his mouth there."
2370.5,2371.5, She's just feeding my drink.
2371.5,2372.5, You won't notice.
2372.5,2373.5, Yeah.
