83.0,90.0, But GFW this entire podcast. I'm not going to say those or three acronyms.
90.0,98.0, I'm going to say those or the three letters. So okay. We have had two big new PC games come out this week.
98.0,106.0," I'm sorry, games for Windows come out this week. Both highly anticipated both highly anticipated by us."
106.0,109.0, One of them was on our cover.
109.0,114.0, Previously the other one we've had kind of mixed feelings going into it all along.
114.0,119.0, But still a totally triple A title that we were genuinely psyched to play.
119.0,127.0, And we've now reviewed them both the two games being dark messiah might magic and Battlefield 2142.
127.0,134.0," And you know, we talked about the scores in a minute, but the game some cells, you know, we've all been playing them or trying to play them."
134.0,139.0," And maybe a little bit not exactly what we were expecting, huh?"
139.0,140.0, Yeah.
140.0,141.0, All the way around.
141.0,143.0, Have we all played much or tried to play both?
143.0,145.0, He tried to play is the community.
145.0,149.0," We should talk about dark messiah first, we should talk about that."
149.0,151.0, Let's talk about this often in the podcast.
151.0,154.0," Yeah. I mean, that will come up. I think in the context of the score."
154.0,155.0, Yeah.
155.0,161.0," But yeah, for for Jevonai, the issue has been tried to play dark messiah because for whatever reasons,"
161.0,166.0," we both have more or less the same, you know, configurations on our on our rigs here."
166.0,171.0, Yeah. And they just do not go well with dark messiah no matter what we do to the settings.
171.0,175.0," You know, update every driver, you know, turn things to the lowest to the highest to the mid range."
175.0,179.0," So in every combination there are, and we basically get."
179.0,181.0," Darin, yeah, you can fill in the blanks because you've actually played it."
181.0,183.0, Yeah. I'm going to ask him.
183.0,186.0, Am I the only person on staff that's been able to actually play this game right now?
186.0,187.0, Yeah. You are. I think so.
187.0,189.0," And on your home, he's the only."
189.0,191.0," Yeah. So for us, can't play it here either."
191.0,192.0," No, I would say I would say."
192.0,195.0, We actually have like the stopwatch stuff.
195.0,197.0," I mean, you sat there and you got your watch."
197.0,198.0, I did.
198.0,199.0, I did.
199.0,200.0, I did. I did.
200.0,202.0, And you're definitely looking at like 10 to 15 minutes.
202.0,206.0," Which, I mean, we're used to saying, hey, I'll be there in 10 minutes and, you know,"
206.0,208.0, It was a figure of speech. It's a very small now.
208.0,212.0," But when you're sitting there for an actual 10 minutes, you're looking at like, you know,"
212.0,215.0, you could read however many pages do hover many other things.
215.0,219.0," Check how much email and then when the game loads and it's like, you know,"
219.0,225.0," welcome to max headroom or, you know, Peeey."
225.0,226.0, Yeah.

273.0,275.0, The.
275.0,276.0, The.
276.0,280.4, like two minutes later and then you realize your dead. And then you're back to your
280.4,284.0, 10-minute loader and I'm for the level. And I think it's worth complaining about this
284.0,288.32, for us because we are not we're clearly not alone. You see the exact identical
288.32,293.68," complaints in internet land. You we tried on different PCs, different types with"
293.68,297.12, different companies you know processors. We're not running our cake
297.12,299.84," disease here, right? But it bit of me at home you've got a whole"
299.84,304.0, another rig. I had the same problem actually. Actually on your home mission
304.0,308.32, and using an AMD processor. Yes. And they see now I'm trying to figure out
308.32,312.08, what the problem is because I I mean granted that my my home machine I built from like the
312.08,316.0, grant from the motherboard up. I have an Intel rig and it's working perfectly. I mean
316.0,319.68, actually like loads really quickly and I even I did a disk install and then I did the
319.68,322.8, steam install afterwards and actually I found the steam install is working
322.8,327.6, you smoother now than the before. I can't figure out for the life of me why it is
327.6,331.44, only my machine at home. It's not just the AMD because I know someone who's got
331.6,336.56, an AMD also in the same 70 100 GTX cards that we're using here and let's use the
336.56,341.92, an ATI. I'm using an Intel and AMD. Right. But no works fine but it works fine.
341.92,346.0, Don't wait for him. Right. So yeah. What's it like to play it?
346.0,351.2, Well I mean it's actually okay it starts off kind of like you know obviously very
351.2,354.72, linear in the beginning. I mean you know holds your hand leading in to stuff and
355.68,360.08, unfortunately that's kind of leads into a problem. I can't really go to this is
360.08,364.96, here's the ironic part. I just got diagnosed with tendonitis so I can't play that much of your game.
364.96,370.08, So the one guy can't play. I'm actually benched right now. I did get about three missions
370.08,373.91999999999996, and before my finger locked up so actually as a quick aside and public service message
373.91999999999996,377.52, kids take a break from playing computer games in the ones in a while because you'll
377.52,383.12, blend up like me. I'm actually taking it. I'm actually seeing a doctor about it so fun.
383.12,386.32, No but the fake can you get that workman's comp from that? Sure hope so.
386.4,393.44, Of course listening. No but as far as as far as I played into the game I do have to take
393.44,396.48, issue with one thing a time-shick brought up in his review and this is like kind of a
396.48,401.6, central point for him. Yeah. Is that you can like kick your way through the entire game.
401.6,406.08, Mm hmm. And you know what I did not find in the the the first few levels I was able to play
406.08,410.24, that I was able to just storm on people to death. I mean yeah you kick people into spike walls
410.24,414.96, or into obstacles but I mean that's part of the game. I personally like the hand hand combat
414.96,420.15999999999997, better than I did in oblivion. It feels more action based and then what should it be?
420.15999999999997,425.44, It should be. And actually. And that's like the one thing it I mean it definitely has no excuse
425.44,431.12, not to do better. I don't think they try to go for an RPG game. I think it's some elements but
431.12,435.44, the one thing that Sean before we start the podcast you brought up and I totally agree with.
435.44,440.32, Is that instead of like getting experience based like you know level up abilities you kind of
440.32,443.84, get skill points as soon as you hit you walk over this invisible marker in the sand hit a
444.0,448.4, checkpoint and then it's supposed to because you've killed exactly the trolls that I want to be
448.4,453.91999999999996, a natural. Or it's like if I unlock like a doom end of level. Yeah totally. I wish there's
453.91999999999996,457.03999999999996, like some ability for me to be able to say okay I killed the Cyclops and a really freaking
457.03999999999996,461.2, cool way that no one else thought of. We're gonna throw an extra five skill points because you earned
461.2,466.23999999999995, it. Instead it's pretty much like picking up the BFG but you get a few choices you know there's like
466.23999999999995,471.2, the BF spell and the BF sword or never and you just get the shoes which one of those you're
471.2,476.56, right. But there's no point in giving all those choices if there's no reward for them is there?
476.56,481.84, Well I don't know every shooter always has its array of it's armory but in this game it seemed like
482.56,487.36, I agree with you right it would have been cool if you got rewarded for your creativity.
487.36,491.2, The expectations. I can think of like say a sex kind of stuff or like they would like
491.2,494.96, you'd find hold their ways to play and you got like you know depending like your actions you
494.96,498.8, were the additional experience points. The game of subtitles might magic because you were
498.8,504.40000000000003, pointing out earlier so the expectation is for it to you know while it's a different genre
504.40000000000003,508.16, and a new direction for the franchise that there are certain things you expect if it's going to
508.16,512.96, have that and I wonder if that was a mistake then I mean like I mean granted they're taking the
512.96,517.28, lore of the might magic universe but maybe it puts too many expectations in that RPG side.
518.0,524.0, Yeah actually they're really not using the lore it's sort of like it's own story but by using
524.0,529.2, that name they're you know they lump themselves together with this 20 year old RPG franchise.
529.2,533.04, So maybe a lot of people especially like younger people don't even know they might magic
533.04,536.56, games so it won't there won't be any baggage but there's probably some people buying it thinking
536.56,541.04, they're going to get some kind of RPG-ish experience. And it's a very superficial will
541.04,545.44, admit its I mean it's it's certainly a different step from what you get from your most
545.44,550.48, FPS games but it's no thief or whatever. It's tough for me because I wanted to play this thing.
550.5600000000001,556.08, I still want to take it out but it's like every day we hear something we hear more and more about it
556.08,560.88, and I hear so many things about it that now it's like I find I'm already like you know biased
560.88,565.12, against it and I say that I'm not reviewing anything so I'm already biased against it because of
565.12,570.5600000000001, the grief I've endured just to try to get to what face it and now I've heard so much so many
570.5600000000001,574.5600000000001, you know negative things about it that when I finally do you know it's like when I finally do
574.5600000000001,579.2, get it running and I'm like do I really want to sit down for 20 hours of this when everyone's already
579.2800000000001,583.6, warned me that like well it's really impossible because the story is a precious mother you know people
583.6,589.5200000000001, really complain about that and I heard through the max headroom audio the woman you know like the
589.5200000000001,595.2, the dark whatever witch in your ear. Of course it's like horrendous I mean I just wanted to gag
595.2,598.4000000000001, soon as she started talking. You know actually there was one part that kind of annoying me in the beginning
598.4000000000001,604.1600000000001, that I just remembered early on I don't know if you during your slideshow if you came across this
604.24,608.88, part where you you go up through the barn you jump across a rope and you meet this guard who's helping
608.88,613.52, you escape and he says close the port call us and you're like okay where do I go and I'm looking
613.52,618.48, around and if you don't find this one lever to pull I found that fine even if I was going to
618.48,623.52, four frames a second that's what I was like like like waking it up painting so you had ample opportunity
623.52,627.6, okay that's that's what I was wondering because like I I was looking at the first one the first
627.6,631.04, my plate I was like okay where the hell is this thing yeah I ran instead of fine I instead of
631.36,634.3199999999999, funny lever on the wall actually ran down that corridor right I'm trying to look into it
634.3199999999999,638.48, that's tough though because if I mean would you have preferred that they made it a giant flashing
638.48,644.64, port post no I'm not with an arrow actually you know I got to that scene and I and I would have liked it
644.64,650.3199999999999, except because I did the same thing as you and I didn't find it right away then it was game over
650.3199999999999,655.36, and then it was a six minute load time right now that's true this game that's the problem with
655.36,659.36, those situations is like I mean on the one side the scene I think is to just beat you over the
659.36,665.12, head with it and you have the you know in some of EA's you know mass market like bond games and whatnot
665.12,670.0, where everything is just like you're basically just following on screen you're actually inspired
670.0,675.36, you're like in the version of dragons layer something but you're what Jeff saying if you can
675.36,680.48, get it so that you have the option to fail and you can continue to play yeah despite that failure
680.48,685.28, although with more you know with with whatever consequence that's not like I'm like I'm like I'm like
685.28,689.1999999999999, like the six minute load that's that's exactly how it didn't help and all that's right if you
689.1999999999999,695.28, kick a if you kick accidentally I kicked a guard a friendly guard it's a game over a media that's
695.28,699.28, a thing that that was what was bothering me is that yeah it wasn't so much they needed a flashing
699.28,703.36, light over it I wanted to just be able to say okay I missed the port colors some guy does
704.0,707.6, the games over can you get like give me a little bit more to work right exactly let me try to
707.6,711.92, explain to the guard that I confused the nerve that goes to my foot with the nerve I thought that
711.92,717.8399999999999, was gonna go to my mouth yeah to say something I eat the last between f and e I mean I got
717.8399999999999,723.52, I got some crap when I wrote the column about games you know about being okay for games to be
723.52,730.0, easier whatever and but this to me it does seem like a like 1986 game convention that they just
730.0,734.9599999999999, immediately smack you to the game over screen you know it doesn't have to be that unforgiving
734.9599999999999,739.52, they could have been ways and you're right I'm completely biased by the load time like I don't
739.52,744.0, want to ever die in this game because I don't want to wait six minutes but even if you take the
744.0,748.56, load time away it's like geez you know yeah you could punish me without reloading the whole
748.56,752.8, fricking level give me a big experience especially when there's no hints there's nothing to know
752.8,757.76, yeah that that thing is gonna cause a game over like kicking an NPC right you know couldn't
757.76,762.16, he do like hey you're like hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're just club me and take away
762.16,767.12, 20 health or something like yeah right that's what that's why I mean it remains to be seen
767.12,772.08, whether or not they deliver on a bit cry tech making crisis or insisting that every single
772.08,777.36, option is of that variety in the game where you can if you miss some kind of timing based thing
777.36,781.44, or if you failed to do this or that you always continue playing the only game over scenario
781.44,787.28, ever is player death and that includes a death of you know NPCs course and stuff like that but
787.28,791.76, so like now I don't want to I don't want to completely back on the game because I haven't been able
791.76,795.52, to play it right which is a good thing that I could have done that you know what's like
795.68,801.1999999999999, 11 which doesn't sound very excited yeah I mean yeah I'm hoping I can still run it
801.1999999999999,805.1999999999999, eventually I did see this morning and so which I was I was wondering the whole time because it was like
805.1999999999999,810.0799999999999, had I you know went out and purchased this game I would be right and I'd want to get on the
810.0799999999999,814.3199999999999, back you know and I found uh someone on on a the quarter to three forms this morning was saying that
814.3199999999999,820.0, they they did the exact same thing and to valve because they got it over over steam and they
820.08,824.88, refunded is you know as you know yeah well that's the bottom line to me it's like it's easy enough for us
824.88,829.36, to be patient and wait for a patch or Sean you were even talking on the phone with the
829.36,833.36, developers of itself I mean you had the luck they were trying to do that even though they could
833.36,837.28, help it of waiting on a help line for an hour right talking you were talking to the actual
837.28,841.28, whelpers who actually couldn't help you so that was trying yeah he was trying to you know recreate
841.28,845.44, the scenario but but what if you were some snuck who bought it at I'm sorry not snuck those
845.5200000000001,851.2, royal readers but if you were somebody who bought the game at at game spot and spettin your
851.2,858.72, you came home yeah it's hard to go to game star and spot a plug for that website and you paid
858.72,862.96, your money and you were facing the problems we were yeah if you I'd want to throw a brick through
862.96,867.12, my yeah I would be done with it I would just take it back and one thing I was going to curious
867.12,871.0400000000001, about yesterday when you were talking to the guys at our can didn't you say like they like they
871.04,876.16, were last build before they submit it to retort but you know for put for going gold it was working
876.16,879.76, fine and was it like copy protection that was screwing it up or is there some kind of like they don't
879.76,885.8399999999999, they are trying to know I mean obviously they're very sincerely you know oh shit by the whole thing
885.8399999999999,890.64, of course don't watch it and they were you know they were saying that the last version they had prior
890.64,895.1999999999999, to the release everything were in fine they hadn't had any of these kind of issues you know
895.2,899.2, tell them what the demo but but you know so they were they weren't saying was the copy
899.2,904.32, protection but they were just saying all we can do is isolate the changes between the last
904.32,908.48, iteration and the iteration that shipped and among those differences are the addition of copy
908.48,913.36, protection and whatnot which is why he's ascending me an uncoppy protected version to see if
913.36,917.6, it were they gonna set that to all the people so he's not trying to find like an excuse I don't
917.6,923.6800000000001, think he's trying to really have every reason in the world to get to the bottom of it and fix it
923.68,931.28, but seriously why are they having to get to the bottom of this now right how does it happen
931.28,935.52, it's not like these are isolated incidents right this is a ton of people having
935.52,940.8, problems fundamentally getting the game to run I mean how many machines did they test it on
940.8,945.5999999999999, right it would be soft in an arcane I mean what I'm wondering is do they port in the the
945.5999999999999,949.52, the copy protection or whatever that last minute and then just okay now it's going go over off
949.52,954.72, the printer's done a game should not be going out in a box in this state if they add any code to
954.72,962.0, it as much as we complain about it's done when it's done uh whole you know M.O. it's times like
962.0,966.0, these when you appreciate it you know I mean when it comes time and you have to say look
966.0,971.36, it's gonna like dig into our our companies earnings in this net but in the end it's gonna like
971.36,976.96, see like yes how is it anything in the short term when it's a long term to ask right because now
976.96,980.5600000000001, people are gonna come away with that bad taste in the mouth and they're gonna associate it both
980.5600000000001,985.0400000000001, with the franchise with the developer with the publisher right I mean it's a very good one thing
985.0400000000001,990.0, it scares me it doesn't get out when it's getting on this is exactly what Blizzard does not do
990.0,995.9200000000001, right Blizzard is exactly does the opposite if they see things not working they just say screw it
995.9200000000001,1001.0400000000001, we're not releasing it right and we don't care if the fans in the short run are gonna be mad and say
1001.0400000000001,1005.6800000000001, they're gonna boycott us or whatever or we're even gonna lose money in the short run because we know
1006.3199999999999,1011.68, in the long term we're gonna make people happy by making a good game right and that's why
1011.68,1015.1999999999999, they never released our craft ghost it's worth looking into it right I wonder if you know I mean
1015.1999999999999,1019.4399999999999, I'll ask him next time I talked to him if it was a case where you know you be soft said it has to
1019.4399999999999,1023.8399999999999, be done at this time and I know the relation's differ because like say for example gear box which
1023.8399999999999,1028.72, is independent but which you be soft publishes their games the brother brothers and our series
1028.72,1033.6, they're able to say it's done when it's done they still have that freedom and you know uh
1033.6799999999998,1038.1599999999999, ready pitch for the CEO where there is like over and over again both in our magazine and in
1038.1599999999999,1043.12, private to me is said you know we have total control over these things I'm just curious if it was
1043.12,1048.32, gonna get it said let's get this thing out now or if it was Ubisoft or what you know I mean what
1048.32,1053.1999999999998, what because it clearly wasn't ready to go out it's very frustrating I mean we put this game on our
1053.1999999999998,1058.6399999999999, cover we were obviously psyched about it and I'd still like to play it and you know
1058.64,1063.3600000000001, clearly the developers are bomb two I mean they must be they don't I'm sure after working for
1063.3600000000001,1067.44, years on their games they don't want to be reading for a post they don't want to hear podcast talks
1067.44,1072.24, like this yeah for us it's like if we shipped our magazine you know and and there were just big blank
1072.24,1078.16, pages printer air copy edit mistakes right and we you know the arts in the wrong places and all the
1078.16,1083.76, things that that haven't we done all of us we have done all of us we're not a white pages no we haven't
1083.76,1090.08, gone that one but so with loaders we're not going to you know happen about it yeah no no right I mean
1090.08,1097.04, we can't check our code either right so it's so I think 2042 is similar and that it definitely
1097.04,1102.8799999999999, feels like it was put out before it was ready yeah I mean actually no I'm just say it was put out before
1102.8799999999999,1109.04, it was ready just period that's all I was to it maybe we had it's based almost entirely on how
1109.04,1115.28, addictive it is to rank up and and acquire unlocks and whatnot and yet they have issues with it
1115.28,1121.36, which they actually just said I got to try it as of last night I think they they they issued one
1121.36,1125.6, one correction where they're trying to make it so that the servers actually do record if you're
1125.6,1130.32, progress what not but that wasn't that might be helpful the type mode which is a big you know big
1130.32,1136.8799999999999, massive sort of bullet point for the game is supposed to be hey here's you know one of the very you know
1136.88,1140.24, foremost reasons you want to play this and why it's new is that we have the subject to based
1140.24,1146.0, tight mode but then the Titans what a commander start moving the things they lack that server so bad
1146.0,1151.3600000000001, and then especially inside the Titan it's just almost impossible to do what that mode is like
1151.3600000000001,1155.6000000000001, you have to capture missile silos right or you capture science which are called
1155.6000000000001,1161.0400000000002, gas silos and they're actually missiles and they fire missiles ground air surface to air missiles
1161.04,1166.08, at the Titan which is of this flying wars okay and it did the shield over carrier but even uh
1166.8,1171.6, blockier and with a giant force field around and when does that when does the big lag kick in so
1171.6,1176.08, okay so what happens then is that they cannot you know that they take out the shields and then you
1176.08,1179.76, start to board these things or you on your own you defend it from people that are boarding it
1179.76,1184.24, it's kind of like a swash buckling you know like you pull the ships up next to one another if you
1184.24,1189.44, want but basically there he it sounds great the it sounds fantastic and it can be really fun
1189.44,1194.96, but um the commanders are able to move the Titans they can move them around the maps and uh and
1194.96,1200.48, when they do that that creates problems already it's makes the whole game lag because you know
1201.04,1205.1200000000001, remember in Battlefield 1942 when you had aircraft carriers I was just gonna say that with them yeah
1205.1200000000001,1209.8400000000001, and it and it was very difficult for them to sync up this this massive piece of geometry in transit
1209.8400000000001,1214.88, with all the characters and things happening on it mines things that you drop kind of slide
1214.96,1220.5600000000002, around or fall through floors and things like that so you have that but you know you have you know
1220.5600000000002,1225.0400000000002, how all these players in there and then both of them get doing it at the same time and then it just
1225.0400000000002,1230.16, really goes goes hey wire I mean it's it's like your ping is fine but inside the thing it's just
1230.16,1234.88, people jerking around rubber banding and all that but if you place a century gun down it might be
1234.88,1238.96, bouncing against the wall or you can even nudge a wall and it's somehow it's registering it as
1238.96,1243.1200000000001, a moving object so it hits you and hurts you it'd be like if you're walking out a haul
1243.12,1248.08, drunk and you stumbled on the side and it gave you like 80 damage you know you got one of those
1248.08,1253.1999999999998, last few weeks so when dies they just slide across the floor and then through the floor through
1253.1999999999998,1258.0, the wall and out out of the out of the titan and you're trying to revive they're like medic medic
1258.0,1261.52, you're trying to get them back in action to help you defend the thing or to assault the thing and they're
1261.52,1267.36, like well I guess you're on your way out yeah in the future people so that's another example I mean
1267.36,1271.12, I can pick on other things because they're quite a few you know triple egg you know just
1271.12,1276.0, upper bugs yeah but I mean those are just examples of I mean you but those are just bugs I mean
1276.0,1282.0, like I'm not testing that had to have said like look do you move these damn titans and and again
1282.0,1288.08, you know you can't accuse this of being like too specific or you know or or or or or or too hard
1288.08,1293.28, core of a nitpick because every game you go on now every server the rules will be moved the
1293.28,1298.56, titan and get kicked or band so it's gotten to the point where everyone has to force it on their own
1298.56,1302.0, it's like if you come in there and you're gonna do this then we don't want you in our server
1302.0,1307.04, we can't care how the players have had to enforce this on their artificial rule right to
1307.04,1314.08, vigilante just to the so I did have someone try to tell me that that was a reflection of my
1314.08,1319.9199999999998, uber core perspective of battlefield and I said well I actually think it's perspective of someone who's
1320.72,1326.1599999999999, your main audience who plays against you you know all the secrets you make and the fact that
1326.24,1332.4, everyone who likes the game enough to run and pay for a server of their own is enforcing this rule
1332.4,1340.4, yeah that shows you might be hard car but you are a fan of the series right you love of battlefield
1340.4,1344.5600000000002, there's plenty of hard I would say that of the you know the million people that Bob Ballfield too
1344.5600000000002,1349.0400000000002, whatever I mean the majority of you would consider hardcore all right you know I mean because that's
1349.0400000000002,1353.68, not a game where you play at once a month it's not a fun I mean if you play that again what's
1354.3200000000002,1359.2, you watch me yeah watch it up and it's a whole time of like oh boy yeah Sean was
1359.2,1364.5600000000002, a fan of a time you gone out geez I was watching you're like look on this forum they got hints
1364.5600000000002,1368.5600000000002, on how to play and they've gone there and like oh man that's stuff it was like the books for
1368.5600000000002,1377.2, rudimentary left left book and you know what sad is I was a hardcore night at 42 player so I'm not
1377.3600000000001,1383.1200000000001, complete rub right it's kind of gameplay right but yeah but I mean a lot is changing this
1383.1200000000001,1386.96, but it just a lot not not then I'm not to get obsessed over the scoring of this but I just found
1386.96,1390.0800000000002, myself wondering what the hell is everyone else smoking why is the entire world on crack and they're
1390.0800000000002,1394.96, giving the game like eight set eight's okay well we know we know there's one review here's
1394.96,1401.04, that was written before the game was even out which is just completely ludicrous right I mean if
1401.04,1404.56, you're gonna write about an online game and give it a score you might want to wait until the
1404.56,1411.12, games actually online for people to play with but okay so we're gonna be in turn this is next
1411.12,1416.8, move on to that yeah that was my clever attempt at a segue well I did want to talk now that we're
1416.8,1422.56, back to scoring system and that our reviews are in some cases appearing prior to the
1422.56,1427.2, issue now we're remembering why we took scores away aren't we yeah that we have scores again
1427.2,1431.6, so we're gonna get nothing but shit both of these games got scores battlefield got uh
1431.6799999999998,1438.3999999999999, 2042 got a six totally fair score and darkness I got a four out of ten and so immediately these
1438.3999999999999,1444.32, seem our striking people is just like preposterously lower harsh scores right so you're right
1444.32,1447.9199999999998, and you want to take it away with the whole yeah let's have this review score discussion
1447.9199999999998,1456.9599999999998, that's do it review king Ryan go oh boy go okay so we like like many other publications in the
1456.96,1463.28, industry we're using a one-to-ten system now and a lot of people have a problem interpreting
1463.28,1470.32, the one-to-ten system um the way it breaks down according to how most publications tend to score
1470.32,1475.3600000000001, their games uh you see a game with an eight or higher and they're that's basically that score
1475.3600000000001,1482.56, is telling you go out by the game could it's good and seven usually winds up appearing to be about
1482.6399999999999,1488.24, average much like a 70% is a c and you know I mean like we're kind of all spoiled by the
1488.24,1494.1599999999999, educational American education switch I really do not know how to compute average I'm not gonna blame
1494.1599999999999,1498.8, people on this like the reader no you say have a hard time understand I think that people have a hard
1498.8,1505.28, difficult time understanding uh how to understand the uses because there's so many varieties of
1505.28,1510.32, interpretation right that the people that employ them use you know well it's also the legacy of the
1510.3999999999999,1516.56, seven is the meaning thing I think it's a lot of the fault is of of our of us the media right who
1517.28,1522.96, who years years years and years of softball reviews I mean they're not softball reviews but of just
1522.96,1528.32, of scoring in this in this way that does not take into account the full scale in that I mean it's
1528.32,1533.36, known within our own industry as the seven to nine scale we all know that we all know this term
1533.36,1538.96, and what that means if you don't know and you're listening is that you know it's that it's sort of
1539.52,1545.68, a default sort of de facto way of thinking both I think for the press and the readers now at this point
1546.16,1552.96, that that you know the entire range of what a game could be is either seven through nine and that
1552.96,1560.24, one to six don't exist anything from from six and a half down is essentially an F right they do
1560.24,1566.0, exist but they're there when someone you know categorically despises a game it's been it doesn't
1566.32,1572.4, is five or three right and it's hard to know what they actually mean what and why are they giving
1572.4,1578.32, this a 20 I think through the evidence for that for that you know that de facto scoring system
1578.32,1583.12, is that if you have what is ostensibly you know a one to ten scale and then you have all these
1583.12,1587.84, fine finer shades in between the numbers some of you's a point five some of it's like you can
1587.84,1594.0, have like an 8.1 a point 28.3 and that's to give when the scale ranges is basically in between
1594.08,1598.24, seven and nine it's to give you a 30 point scale instead of a three point scale right now what was
1598.24,1602.96, that review that that we were talking about before the pockets that gave it was a battlefield
1602.96,1608.64, well there's an 8.4 a point four what does that even right so we were joking what 8.5 would have been good but
1608.64,1614.4, the point four signal that we're not the three the context of the context of the we was saying how
1614.4,1618.72, they could have had all these inherent problems and talk and breaks it down like all these things
1618.72,1623.92, that are wrong with it and then it says 8.4 which right so this is a classic seven to nine scale
1623.92,1630.72, problem they they found all problems with the game and to signal that it was a not that it was
1630.72,1635.76, a disappointing game they gave it an 8.4 right which if you're trying to use the full scale like we are
1635.76,1641.6000000000001, completely screws up the perception of what we're trying to do so like a set yeah it's like I gave it
1641.6000000000001,1647.1200000000001, a six which which from our you know our our conditions is above average and that was because
1647.12,1652.6399999999999, despite all these these problems and then besides you know you know in addition to the bugs
1652.6399999999999,1657.76, I want not there there are a number of other things about the game itself it's just it's you know too soon too
1657.76,1664.56, quickly it's it's you know not it definitely seems like a mod and it's not it's nowhere near is entertaining to me even
1664.56,1671.52, you know bugs and and flaps aside as BF2 was and all these other reasons but the the unlocks system
1671.68,1677.92, and the ranking system is actually more engaging than the game is fun to play but that still counts for
1677.92,1683.28, something that still makes you want to play it you know and that when you read your review and you look at
1683.28,1690.8799999999999, our scoring scale it completely makes sense you know the the the six that you gave it applies right
1690.8799999999999,1695.84, and the text of course which which which always gets swept under the rug in discussions of scores
1695.9199999999998,1701.04, text makes it clear that actual things despite these things that I'm talking about I'm also
1701.04,1705.76, underscoring that these are the enjoyable and rewarding aspects of the game and you can wait
1705.76,1711.36, those accordingly to how they sound to you how significantly you hold those okay so why are we right
1712.1599999999999,1718.1599999999999, and everybody else is wrong in terms of scale I mean like we're fighting a massive perception battle
1718.1599999999999,1723.9199999999998, with trying to use a 10 point scale and using the whole thing so why do we even bother and what do we
1724.0,1728.16, do about it well we have I guess one thing is just to have everyone listening just repeat the
1728.16,1734.5600000000002, mantra five is average but we are fighting an uphill battle right now in the print in the beginning
1734.5600000000002,1739.76, of the review section we can also spell this out it's right is doing I think we need to do it on
1739.76,1744.72, what up as well or that and that I think is where it's complicated you know like you're saying I want
1744.72,1749.52, up because for one the environment's different it's a hyperlink environment where you could be on
1749.6,1753.76, game rankings one minute looking at an agenda review and then a game spot review and then you end
1753.76,1758.72, up with the one up review and you're like hey these are all 10 point skills and then you see the
1758.72,1762.72, difference and you're just basically looking at them as you know all things equal these are all 10
1762.72,1766.8799999999999, points skills how can they be any different yeah 10 is 10 and then you go to one of the one game rankings
1766.8799999999999,1772.16, which converts everyone's skill to like a five point skill right suddenly and what's supposed to be
1772.16,1778.08, part of this same collective thought is what screwed up as our review might actually be you know in
1778.1599999999999,1782.96, terms of what we're saying about the game exactly the same as what game spot an IGN said but
1782.96,1787.1999999999998, yeah because of the difference in the scoring it looks like and we gave it away worse for review
1787.1999999999998,1791.36, uh and I can we say it's like yeah if maybe if you worked or you're freelancing for one of these
1791.36,1797.1999999999998, outlets you would score higher because you'd be like I don't want this game is as flawed as I think
1797.1999999999998,1801.4399999999998, it is I still think it's more entertaining than like whatever you know Pac-Man World Rally
1802.1599999999999,1807.52, but that game's on here with the score of like 8.9 and that's gonna force me to do this or that so
1807.52,1813.44, it's it's really big complicated mess and I think we want up it should be very clear and about
1813.44,1817.92, you know the way that we're we're aiming to do in the beginning of our review section that okay you're now
1817.92,1823.04, entering this territory and this is how you know we understand this scale but then the other thing is that you have
1823.04,1829.2, so many different writers and it's just a matter of keeping us all in touch keeping us all in the same page you know
1829.2,1833.92, we're Ryan you can you can send out you know emails and have phone conversations or directly speak to
1834.0,1838.24, all the people that are writing for your review section but that needs to happen everywhere so that
1838.24,1842.0800000000002, because all it takes is just you know one that's really out of touch or a few people they're
1842.0800000000002,1847.6000000000001, consistently really out of touch and they're at least in terms of writing for a seven to nine scale
1847.6000000000001,1852.0800000000002, and it's gonna make the stuff look really bad because then it's gonna make that six that I gave it
1852.0800000000002,1857.44, really look like like a four or something you know yeah that's right it has to be consistent and this is
1857.44,1862.3200000000002, kind of and it's also like a really minor point but one thing I started noticing actually just this morning
1862.3999999999999,1866.6399999999999, so with the dark beside review which got a four if you take a look and if you go to the review on
1866.6399999999999,1871.4399999999998, what up right now you take a look and it says underneath the four broken five is average four is broken
1871.4399999999998,1875.36, yeah so it seems like it's a very little middle ground wording stuff we need to exactly
1875.36,1879.36, it needs to be consistent so you think across the board and I'm not saying that it's totally bust
1879.36,1884.3999999999999, but I think it's just some legacy stuff so but that's yeah that's that's almost in line with the
1884.3999999999999,1889.04, seven and nine where the difference between a seven and a six is like satisfied period on playable
1889.12,1893.36, right you know that's a wording issue but you know like I was saying before the podcast my
1893.36,1898.56, one of my worries is no matter how we describe no matter what the legend says what these numbers mean
1899.36,1908.3999999999999, the the you know the American school system of 70% as a C and 60% is a D you know how do we
1908.3999999999999,1913.6, ever get past that so that's just a letter grades is that easier I don't that well
1914.56,1920.3999999999999, I would be really nice yeah it would be nice and her team of weekly does it it's very it's very
1920.3999999999999,1926.0, understandable what a C is like the requires no explanation already like our old CGW the star
1926.0,1930.08, system and the one through five stars if you break it down it's like fundamentally the same
1930.9599999999998,1936.3999999999999, as the one that it is but it's just like the perception is just the perception is with the
1936.4,1941.2, fighting a big battle here you know let's take away the damn scores again
1943.2,1948.4, you know this it's not damn well put him back everybody else it has to take him away with
1948.4,1953.76, the dark back the Dartmouth I review I just had a conversation with the person that you
1953.76,1961.68, be soft who's doing the PR management on that game oh and she probably wasn't happy of course they're
1961.68,1967.1200000000001, all unhappy with the fact that we gave it four out of 10 but and she was she was saying that
1967.1200000000001,1974.3200000000002, she thought that it read more like eight more like an eight yeah see there you go you're kidding
1974.3200000000002,1981.76, you which like the posture is why the seven tonight scale right yeah I guess yeah I guess
1981.76,1987.8400000000001, yeah we actually got into what got into kind of a debate about our score versus another semi-low
1987.84,1992.8799999999999, score that another place gave it and I actually when as far as to go to like their the sighting
1992.8799999999999,1999.76, questions scoring description right and where they actually state that seven is our average
1999.76,2004.9599999999998, that's what I'm saying yeah like we could give the a game the exact same negative review as
2004.9599999999998,2010.8799999999999, another website but because of the scoring it's gonna look like we didn't like it nearly as much
2010.8799999999999,2015.12, when in fact we might have said the exact same thing but they're they're scoring and that's
2015.12,2021.76, all we get to you know first I had we shouldn't even be talking to PR people about reviews after
2021.76,2027.52, the reviews go up but after that it's like for but they always calling you in 42 and again the concern
2027.52,2035.36, was the score is harsh it wasn't the the criticism that you have about the game or harsh it wasn't
2035.36,2041.36, that yeah your your understanding of the game is misinformed or or is harsh it's the score is harsh
2041.36,2045.6799999999998, yeah yeah the scores will make a lot more sense to people I think when the first issue gets in
2045.6799999999998,2051.04, people's hands because it's got a closed box system there where you do see the full right in effect
2051.04,2056.4, you do yeah these these are like the first two like random shotgun blasts that happened to appear
2056.4,2061.04, online yeah they were both high profile games right look at god fairly low score and so
2061.04,2064.96, and I'm afraid as I think time-shick was a little too harsh but but pretty much on the money I
2064.96,2070.08, would have given the game maybe a five well that just when I will or or hope it to be able to play the
2070.08,2075.04, game to yeah I can't rate it much above like I wanted this one I can't even fucking play
2075.04,2079.2799999999997, I can't even get it our experience with it is pretty much a zero right but we don't know
2079.2799999999997,2083.68, but we don't just don't technically it's just zero now but it could be an eight or a nine
2083.68,2090.64, and it's not really interesting and that's a that's a really good point here's a guy
2090.64,2095.12, who had none of these issues and you know I added his piece and I spent some time on email
2095.12,2099.52, with him like hey you know I can't play the game and there's a whole bunch of people saying
2099.52,2103.44, they can't play the game how come you didn't talk about this in your view well he's one of the
2103.44,2108.16, lucky people who didn't have any technical problems it all except for the sound stuttering
2109.12,2113.7599999999998, but what he did mention in the review but yeah ironically he just didn't like the game
2115.84,2121.04, what so they kind of got off easy yeah right if he had had a technical problems like we had
2121.6,2126.88, boy that four would have been yeah even rougher and all the other thing the this seven and nine
2126.88,2132.8, system like when you get down to it it the only reason it exists is to feed like the marketing
2133.52,2139.84, oh yeah absolutely which is just like a weird you know right well there yeah but we
2139.84,2144.88, here it's looking when we get these calls after a bad review you know it's always you know you
2144.88,2150.48, get this kind of sense of betrayal in a way like you screwed up our marketing plan yeah
2150.48,2154.7200000000003, we can't but just as we shouldn't be talking yeah we can't put this on the box
2155.68,2161.12, like that's what we are writing for that consumers I got a quote for your box right here
2162.9599999999996,2168.64, I have a couple screw your game I have a couple of PR contacts who like like clockwork
2168.64,2173.2799999999997, whenever we give one of one of this company's games uh most core you're always calling me and just
2173.2799999999997,2180.7999999999997, be like for sure anything below 70% of game rankings is market play as we know some of the industry
2180.88,2188.48, that these PR people sadly very sadly and very unfairly I think often live and die by the
2188.48,2194.5600000000004, scores that this games get right so you know if you know I don't know if it's true with this game
2194.5600000000004,2198.7200000000003, so let's just use it as an example and if and if this isn't the case please don't misinterpret
2198.7200000000003,2206.2400000000002, me and I apologize but let's say with dark Messiah you know that it's it's entirely possible that
2207.2,2211.9199999999996, the company is saying hey you know if that you know that they're calling the PR person and
2211.9199999999996,2217.52, and saying why did this game get a four what do you do wrong right what did you not give
2217.52,2223.12, us you know this is w the right message they're not getting a screens you know they blame the PR
2223.12,2229.04, people for for their bad game right this assumption is that basically a PR person
2229.68,2234.9599999999996, ends up determining the review score right and sometimes they'll they'll get a bonus or not get
2235.6,2241.52, depending on the kind of scores that they're ultimately gets it's a really good
2241.52,2249.04, part of it but it's broken thinking and like if they want to reward a PR person for doing
2249.04,2252.32, their job well it's you know forget if securing preview coverage or something right that's what
2252.32,2258.64, their job works he has to be a person fault if the game is bad sure okay they could be the best
2258.64,2263.04, PR person in the world they could have scored a cover for the scheme we could be their best
2263.04,2267.2799999999997, buds we you know we could be writing about this game every month but when the game comes out
2267.2799999999997,2273.84, and it sucks we're gonna say it sucks no matter how great the PR person was it's yeah and I think
2273.84,2278.4, a lot of people just like inside even inside the industry they just don't get that yeah they don't
2279.44,2284.8, okay half cases where they actually try to try to tell you with the really concerned about who's
2284.8,2289.2799999999997, reviewing which game in the past you use that's that's another one and I don't know it's like I say
2289.28,2292.6400000000003, that and I almost expected like because I know like if I was in certain company people would
2292.6400000000003,2296.5600000000004, get really nervous like hey quite down we don't talk about that stuff but but screw it you know
2296.5600000000004,2301.28, I mean that that's that stuff has got to change it has got to change it's such a headache no
2301.28,2305.6800000000003, you're not in the loose by calling out but yes so they'll they'll want to know who's reviewing it
2305.6800000000003,2311.92, they almost want to make recommendations oh yeah to keep a history of how we just bond and how each
2311.92,2317.44, reviewer reviews various games we think palm check on it you are right because he's a fan of
2317.44,2323.12, the franchise yeah you think that the greatest supporting alumni for you how how favorable they assume
2323.12,2329.2000000000003, the review we're gonna produce is you right the review for us and submit it here since you're
2329.2000000000003,2333.76, so concerned about it we think Bruce Shelley would be great for reviewing age of empires three
2335.36,2340.4, and I say this as a friend of bris so I'm just using his it's or like in the commerce like
2340.4,2344.8, we really don't want this person on this review right you know it just makes me want to give
2344.8,2349.04, you a good idea me too never tell me what you don't want to see because I'm gonna do exactly
2349.04,2352.0, that but we'll have another secret they'll totally do like we're really makes you wonder
2352.0,2358.0, this kind of this kind of crap exist and other you know entertainment media it's the whole the
2358.0,2362.88, whole world is running out like for politics on down it's just a big matter of like
2363.92,2368.0, yeah but damn it we're holding true while it's like you know like we were talking about the other
2368.0,2374.48, day you know game quote unquote critics getting paid to do these satellite media tours where
2374.48,2381.36, they're you know like there's examples of of a freelance journalist who will show up on these
2381.36,2387.76, like morning shows or whatever today or around the time of E3 you know so tell us what's hot at E3
2387.76,2392.24, this year and now I'll mention a few games and it turns out that actually they've been paid
2392.88,2397.68, by the company need to say to say those things yeah yeah I've heard about like yeah you know the
2397.7599999999998,2402.0, movie industry you get like these junket things going on where they show up movie and then like
2402.0,2406.7999999999997, the critics like maybe halfway through some of them will just go and like sign up for a quote
2406.7999999999997,2412.8799999999997, there's like an alpix that one like wireless mag has like the yeah like wireless the urban
2412.8799999999997,2416.8799999999997, radio network so then all those ones that you see on the bad news that are saying wow
2417.9199999999996,2422.8799999999997, anyway it's like a little bit strange and like this is something like a great song so it's a
2422.88,2427.76, semester of like knowing who the like respectable critics are versus like the wireless radio
2427.76,2433.76, network right right so it's not just the game and now we need to talk about it and it's
2433.76,2437.6800000000003, and in in our industry though it's far more than just to review is like you mean it's everything
2437.6800000000003,2441.76, like you're saying E3 was just the the biggest in my mind one of the most you know despicable
2441.76,2446.96, and completely absurd offenders in that you still it'll be interesting to see what happens this
2446.96,2452.1600000000003, year going going forward as as the convention changes but the whole you know you fought against
2452.16,2456.72, it forever about the notion of the E3 judges I am so glad I would have to be on that
2456.72,2461.3599999999997, you get a pause for the winner and then you're like okay well who what did it win and you look
2461.3599999999997,2467.2799999999997, and it's like it's like E3 and it's not even part of the sometime the E3 judges award is bad enough
2467.2799999999997,2471.6, is the postures enough but then you see like winner but it's like some random website
2471.6,2476.64, check these game shex says it was one of the notable like the initiative game show events games
2476.72,2482.08, yeah but you're like so it was a winner based on I mean like what what the hell does it seem
2482.08,2489.04, oh I know I mean I I for the beginning of the E3 game critics you know committee whatever
2489.04,2494.72, I boycotted it at first because I just totally didn't believe in it but the sad fact was that it
2494.72,2500.3199999999997, it granted you access to stuff at E3 that they weren't showing anybody else that was the only
2500.3199999999997,2505.68, one or I mean we're only gonna let you see it if you're an E3 game critic so I finally they
2505.7599999999998,2510.7999999999997, warm me down and I joined it but I was so against it because it was like why am I what am I voting on here
2510.7999999999997,2515.12, these are like didn't you why these are made as these are free beta these are alphas of not only that
2515.12,2520.8799999999997, there vertical slices are I mean often that that do not reflect any levels that will exist in the final
2520.8799999999997,2525.6, product it was absolutely it was it was it was a complete marketing yeah it was a waste just the
2525.6,2530.0, helpers time fucking boxes sit there and say let's make some some shit that's not even going to be
2530.0,2534.7999999999997, part of the game that's just going to like wow people in this just wildly artificial environment
2534.8,2539.92, making it commercial and right for press yeah when you like hey this is a chance for us too
2539.92,2543.84, we'll make a special pretty logo on it and we'll get it on every other box out there and it's got
2543.84,2548.32, our website URL on it right we'll expose ourselves too let's let's make right and what are you
2548.32,2552.88, giving awards to you're giving awards nothing you're right and and I think what you said before
2552.88,2558.2400000000002, is that was really the saddest part was a game developers and publishers were now starting to waste
2558.2400000000002,2562.6400000000003, time throughout the year just getting ready for E3 instead of working on the actual game
2562.64,2569.2, history stuff to win stupid award you know when you did vote didn't even vote for games like
2569.2,2576.96, like brass dolls and stuff I messed up the bounty every time a fake off through every year
2576.96,2583.12, there's going to be like who the hell voted for yeah I like a jangling chat of the game pretty much
2583.12,2587.6, I was because I was like you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna do that and then the judges let's keep
2588.16,2593.7599999999998, know me that the judges you would get special things from the PR yeah they would try to the show
2593.7599999999998,2598.4, oh yeah I mean though there was one year when I was a judge I would get like like such
2598.4,2602.48, amazing shachkeys was ridiculously yeah they were swag oh the only the only one I really appreciate
2602.48,2607.8399999999997, it was a bottle whiskey they knew me but it came in a casket a came in a casket came in a giant like
2607.8399999999997,2612.16, I mean like it was like what two and a half feet but giant for like a a chachki came to a casket
2612.16,2615.7599999999998, and this and that and they said I drank the bottle still didn't vote for them but thank you for the

3012.8,3018.08, more than sucks yeah let's talk about a good evening though okay okay oh yeah ours
3019.04,3028.48, the whole time 20 and 42's shut up sorry you're done for a carry level
3028.48,3033.04, alright let's let him talk I'm done preparing yeah how many hours you log by the way this time
3034.16,3037.7599999999998, I don't know I checked yesterday and it was up to a total of 556
3038.72,3043.68, dude wow you really you could have written war in peace well Joe's well
3044.64,3051.3599999999997, but um it night falls out and it's it's good is it very good it's it's according to our
3051.3599999999997,3056.3199999999997, scoring system it would probably be not use that it would probably be excellent okay so you're
3056.3199999999997,3064.96, so a six yeah but um for anybody who hasn't who hasn't gotten into to Guild Wars it's it's a
3064.96,3070.16, pretty good pretty good starting point they they've done a lot of things with the NPCs to make them
3071.12,3079.2, non to be more p uh yeah actually actually yeah yeah the NPCs before who you could use in
3079.2,3085.68, lieu of of real players and who were oftentimes better than real players um it was a big surprise yeah
3085.68,3091.52, on line game they were kind of like these generic characters that you couldn't really control you
3091.52,3096.08, couldn't what were their rad names like Tom like THR-E
3096.16,3100.24, just don't know what you can do so I think that was one of the main ones right and tell
3100.24,3103.92, you about one of the mission your favorite missions from the game hang out I'll get to that okay okay
3103.92,3110.7999999999997, but um the NPCs uh the new guys you can you can uh they love luck with you and you can
3110.7999999999997,3115.2, equip them with whatever equipment you want do they persist then they do and they're actually
3115.2,3120.0, part of the story it's like a single player RPG almost like these dudes join you and so when you log
3120.0,3124.72, off and log back in the same dude will be there with the stuff you gave him and in this living
3124.72,3128.8799999999997, breathing world we just say you begin to care for these these figures just a little bit
3128.8799999999997,3134.08, Ryan can you give a game he felt like silence that was that was that was Kings Quest 4
3135.3599999999997,3146.8799999999997, that was the long time ago yeah we'll pass that so back on a break I asked Ryan if a video
3146.8799999999997,3153.04, game can make him cry okay I didn't know the sentence I mean too I cry when Tom went and stood in the
3153.12,3160.72, fire pit let himself die but he was like my only monk actually Tom's a fighter so never mind
3160.72,3164.32, so the NPCs in this game don't do things like that because you can tell them not to
3165.7599999999998,3170.8, you can set up their skills however you want so you know that your necromancer doesn't just
3171.44,3177.84, use a bunch of life training spells and kill himself it's good so how would you compare it say to
3177.92,3184.0, factions the last one faction why I like the setting and factions better like the whole like
3184.56,3191.28, Asia land sort of thing you're all about Asia land yeah it's got theme park
3192.0,3194.4, time to buy Ryan and
3194.4,3196.0, eight age of lands
3198.0,3201.6800000000003, put out the new the new classes in nightfall or
3201.7599999999998,3209.2799999999997, at a lot better I think than the one to in factions the one to factions the ritualists and the assassin
3209.9199999999996,3213.04, are both kind of they both kind of suck the ritualists
3214.16,3220.96, they're the adding the fetishes the retoucher I want to add like the OCDs in character
3220.96,3227.9199999999996, the fetishes that's the robber coffee class but the um thanks the new classes the new classes in this game kind of
3228.0,3235.92, have like a more a clearer place in things there's the dervish who's like a like a melee fighter they
3235.92,3242.32, use like sides and they have all these enchantments spells that kind of buff them and when they're in
3242.32,3253.76, melee which is at the sanded like every you compare them to the assassin in factions who was also a
3253.84,3259.92, melee class yeah but um assassins had no way of of really making themselves stay alive
3260.48,3266.7200000000003, they're like in melee so they just run up and die which is why nobody really takes assassins into groups
3268.8,3274.5600000000004, and um the other new classes uh the paragon who sort of like the pallidin and wow
3274.5600000000004,3281.2000000000003, it's just like lots of groups and so it's like a healer they're boring support class
3281.2799999999997,3284.16, fellow the dude that gets ordered around all the time
3284.7999999999997,3288.3999999999996, hey I'll be here agron give me a plus five step buff if I continue to take
3289.4399999999996,3296.48, there you go he and me res and then um and the other thing the other thing I've been noticing in
3296.48,3303.04, the in I've always like just like weird amounts of geek humor there's such an end of the game itself yeah
3303.04,3308.08, okay like genuinely laugh out loud is it well there is a role where they well there do like this whole
3308.16,3314.24, quest that's that's a spoof of of snakes on a plane huh it's it's what's a cold it's actually
3314.24,3321.2799999999997, called a Drake's on the plane like here you're a L.A.I.N. oh my god it's totally immersion breaking you're
3321.2799999999997,3326.16, walking you're walking across this this plane because you're you're delivering this this site to
3326.16,3333.2799999999997, this dude who's gonna buy it I thought it was a scice that's a scite side side yeah is it okay
3333.28,3339.52, yeah never mind gone and and the site is it's a banana site it's like a it's a banana an actual
3339.52,3344.2400000000002, banana I don't know why it's a banana but it's a banana site okay oh they're talking I it's got to be
3344.2400000000002,3349.2000000000003, a reference to something but I don't know okay but um and you're walking across this plane to to meet
3349.2000000000003,3354.0, this guy and there's all these these Drake's like these dragon sort of things running around that
3354.0,3359.44, you're fighting I thought it with these motherfucking yeah yeah hey now and like and he um and we are
3359.44,3363.92, I did the quick aside we are able to swear there's much we want at least according to
3363.92,3370.4, just did the EGM podcast yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
3370.4,3374.48, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

3386.56,3397.04, had it with these god bless dude Drake on this god bless and playing so all right maybe it had to
3397.04,3401.84, be there yeah yeah so the character in uh in the wow expansion now in Burning Crusade there's
3401.84,3407.36, a one of the cooking trainers like somebody make weak sauce is this name that's kind of funny
3408.0,3413.68, but see you want to do that again wow okay hey Michael wins low here we need we need some
3413.68,3420.24, like cricket sound effects for that kind of stuff yeah yeah like did you know you play because he's
3420.24,3425.3599999999997, sauce because he's like say it's a cook I'm gonna it's like the punch line you tell some
3425.3599999999997,3433.2, long way to joke and the punch line is and he said hung it up on some noobs you get it he changed the
3433.2,3440.48, the over a p and call it the plane experience players moves the
3441.9199999999996,3446.96, do you go back to being better yeah since countermeasure no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
3446.96,3451.3599999999997, it's a fantastic mode the morning's good I'm a morning person really a little spaz in the morning
3451.3599999999997,3455.3599999999997, alright let's talk about the bow card that has in the morning let's get asked before we do that okay
3455.3599999999997,3459.7599999999998, do you play nightfall as like a single player game like when you're playing through the
3459.84,3465.1200000000003, I generally try to rely on on other players as well as possible yeah I was gonna say like you're
3465.1200000000003,3472.1600000000003, an NPC kind of guy when I yeah it's a great spot did you did you in the course of that I mean
3472.1600000000003,3477.2000000000003, when when I was watching you play you were commanding you know you're NPCs to do all these various
3477.2000000000003,3481.92, things but you were even with them you were up on a hill like overseeing them it was that just more
3481.92,3486.8, of like is that just like how specific your the commands you can give them well that what you
3486.8,3490.6400000000003, were seeing that day was kind of like a tutorial mode that showed me how to command them around
3491.52,3497.1200000000003, but it's sort of like I mean you can command a specific spot you can you can tell them to target
3497.1200000000003,3502.2400000000002, specific enemies and it almost I guess if you want to play it that way works almost like a pseudo
3502.2400000000002,3508.1600000000003, RTS you know that's pretty cool and there there's like a whole PvP mode with with these
3508.1600000000003,3512.6400000000003, these hero NPCs I have a lot of cool you know it's kind of interesting it's actually what's
3512.6400000000003,3516.6400000000003, what's it got to hear us is trying to do something similar to that actually that meant to kind of
3516.64,3521.52, the basic thing where to me to play like an online RPG single player like that but that is
3521.52,3525.92, actually something that might bring me back to Guild Wars yeah that's very popular Guild Wars is
3525.92,3530.16, I haven't find anyone that I normally play with who wanted to play with me you could play with Ryan
3531.2,3535.92, well yeah like that was right by you you can fall like in the planes and I play the
3535.92,3539.8399999999997, great the original prior expansions a whole lot yeah like you don't have to
3539.8399999999997,3543.92, try to send it and did all that like then it's kind of like I probably got into some other game
3544.8,3548.8, I have a lot of respect for that game I just it's like a time thing it was awesome it was a great it was
3548.8,3556.2400000000002, like definitely the best games that year and yet you have time for wow yeah okay wow is work
3556.8,3562.0, you're the only room for one giant time thing right and which actually is a big part of the
3562.0,3567.52, discussion we had with Jeff Butler yesterday so if I may make a quick aside oh please do Jeff Butler being
3568.24,3574.56, the CEO of Sidil Games who's making Vanguard so last week we had talked about how we wanted to talk to them
3575.12,3580.72, about Vanguard and so we did we had a very special podcast with Mr Butler yesterday and we talked
3580.72,3586.08, about all sorts of great things and he was very candid about the you know this whole issue of
3586.08,3591.28, how are you going to get people to quit wow to play your game so we're gonna post that some at some
3591.28,3597.6000000000004, point this week so let's look forward on this special bonus GFW podcast it's because we love you
3598.0,3604.6400000000003, because we did that way in that way we just want to be friends maybe you do
3605.6800000000003,3614.2400000000002, I'm in it special I'm all in your in it FTW okay so so the while training card game
3615.28,3620.32, we saw this game in action upper deck and came by to show this game to us a few weeks ago
3620.4,3624.32, actually got my cards in the mail the other day you did you went out of the water
3624.32,3628.88, well I had pre-ordered him like two months ago that's right okay but since since the happy
3628.88,3633.36, fun time when we saw the game it looked kind of neat and it looked like it was just going to be some
3633.36,3638.4, you know random you know another training guard game that was going to interest some
3638.4,3645.04, point oh oh one subset of all dorks on earth as usual with wow has turned out to be
3645.6,3652.32, an underestimate of the truth and so now there's kind of a doku there's sort of a big controversy
3652.32,3658.96, about it and who wants to field the wild training card game controversy right uh well
3658.96,3664.08, people are pretty sure because they have to buy cards to get special things like turtle mount
3664.08,3670.24, in the game yeah this is I don't know if anyone who's like following the wild card
3670.3199999999997,3674.7999999999997, game knows that there were these loot cards that are essentially they kind of pitched the mist
3674.7999999999997,3678.24, like Willy Wonka golden tickets you're like three years right yeah there's three different
3678.24,3684.64, kind there's like a turtle mount which is like something a level one player can use which is unusual
3684.64,3689.12, for bounce because only level 40s can use mounts normally and there's like a tabard which is just like
3689.12,3696.16, a shirt basically and what was the other one the baby hippogriff that's right so it's all strictly
3696.16,3703.92, cosmetic all cosmetic right it doesn't even have a speed boost it's a turtle no speed yeah
3703.92,3709.8399999999997, yeah yeah so then there's another set of loot of loot you can get that isn't from the special
3709.8399999999997,3713.92, like random cards that are packed in these booster packs from collecting these points so every
3713.92,3718.72, booster pack you get to get a hundred points that you redeem on the upper deck website right and
3719.3599999999997,3723.92, as you it's essentially like grinding faction for upper deck entertainment instead of you know
3723.92,3730.0, for like the bloods and the buckiniers and right so if you're thinking it out it's a breakout there's
3730.0,3734.32, three things you unlock there there's another tabard and then there's like a fireworks display
3734.32,3739.52, trinket which is essentially you know some particle effects to appear above your head like
3739.52,3745.44, and so basically total all cosmetic but but right but so I got some people figured out that
3745.44,3749.6800000000003, to like earn enough points to get the fireworks whatever meant there were gonna have to buy this
3749.68,3753.9199999999996, many booster packs or whatever which meant this amount of real world money but if you
3753.9199999999996,3759.3599999999997, just a fact that amount of real world money to get to ride around on the turtle you don't need to
3759.3599999999997,3764.3999999999996, complain to the card makers or the other you need to know your mom for dropping your head
3764.3999999999996,3774.64, yeah there's a ton I think that's the yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
3774.64,3779.3599999999997, I think that like it's just so expensive to get these stupid little cosmetic trinket yeah that's
3779.3599999999997,3785.2," some of the foreign posts are outright they're unreal like they're making me buy $2,000 worth of"
3785.2,3790.7999999999997, cards just to get this tabard like that's the no one's making you spend it's just eliminating it's
3790.7999999999997,3796.8799999999997, like the show today you see someone writing that turtle it's like the red badge of like this
3796.8799999999997,3802.4, grace you know what that dude bought a bunch of cards stock for like any bucks we can write
3802.4,3806.56, around on that shitty little turtle and it's that's what you should do in game and that's the
3806.56,3811.92," end of the front and they're up on eBay and they're up on eBay for like $2,000 like how much"
3811.92,3815.84, the turtle now going for on eBay right so so basically I'm pretty sure getting all this grief
3815.84,3820.32, online for basically running their business as they've always run it yeah this is right I mean
3820.32,3824.7200000000003, these that's what that's what trading card games are of the trading card right it's like buying
3824.7200000000003,3829.52, like a box on an interior it's gonna be a plus honeybee and then like complaining that you had to buy
3830.16,3834.72, right now on the entire the by all the honeybee I think it would be kind of funny is if they
3834.72,3838.32, actually like I would be curious to see what the pins opinions are people who actually play the magic
3838.32,3843.68, gathering card games I mean it's a good game is it out of line it is it is it's so out of whack
3843.68,3850.16, from what everyone else does I've not listened to card game itself is a game and it's a good game
3850.16,3855.36, this loot card thing that was just like bonus extra crap for wild players I mean it's being
3855.36,3861.6, totally they're on its own to take the energy of the people but they're only taking advantage
3861.6,3865.52, of tenses of people that already have those tenancies you know right they're not going to create
3865.52,3870.1600000000003, a minimal after not going to create new crack addicts here right people who are already personality
3870.1600000000003,3875.2000000000003, type which has to have don't blame people for it's like you know for for catering to that like
3875.2000000000003,3880.4, perverse well right then we can go after the tobacco companies for providing tobacco right
3880.4,3884.2400000000002, do a liquor companies for providing like or you know people are going to have their addiction
3884.3199999999997,3889.2799999999997, there's nothing wrong with your company right or comic books you know I mean I used to listen
3889.2799999999997,3894.16, it I'm just like like two years away from bitching about spending twenty or thirty dollars a week

3924.0,3930.56, exactly so yeah so controversy here is that people are crazy yeah I wanted a real controversy
3930.56,3934.7999999999997, I thought there was like I want to know real genuine scandal no there's we are talking about
3934.7999999999997,3939.2, you want scandal I got scandal you do people complaining all right well I don't know the
3939.2799999999997,3943.7599999999998, scandal that scandal that's pretty good scandal do you want to talk about that or do you want to
3943.7599999999998,3948.3999999999996, wait till well you know what I'm just gonna I'm gonna hold off on the full thing for now but I
3948.3999999999996,3954.0, do want to give props to hexes dot net it's a British hardware review site had you spelled that
3954.0,3961.3599999999997, H ex u s dot net so they post it up this news the other day now I still have to confirm with sources
3961.3599999999997,3966.24, but I'm gonna give them full props read the story it's about their dealings with Alienware
3966.3199999999997,3970.4799999999996, I'm gonna come back next week with a full report but I'm gonna say one thing right now
3970.4799999999996,3976.4799999999996, if anybody ever on the hardware site dictated to me terms that I'm not gonna review their
3976.4799999999996,3981.52, products anymore if it's a good review unless to good review I would blackball them from this magazine
3981.52,3986.56, they would never see their hardware review to my magazine damn are you all you know I'm just
3986.56,3991.8399999999997, going to get a game reviews you know you don't hear about that going on with the game review
3992.7200000000003,3998.32, but with hardware I some companies now I don't know if this is totally true and I'm just saying in general
3998.32,4003.6800000000003, if anybody where to ever dictate terms to me I don't want their stuff in my magazine so that's a
4003.6800000000003,4008.56, show then you can't review my PC there yeah well your PC sucks any
4009.6000000000004,4016.56, hey you can't review it let's see the couple other random things before we sign off we got word about
4017.04,4023.04, the New Yorker thing that was pretty cool yeah nice little bit of mainstream press for the game industry
4023.04,4028.64, what was that about there well it's just a story looking at the kind of like the the quick look at the
4028.64,4033.2, evolution of the game industry but it's a main focus on wheel right and his basically looking at his
4033.2,4037.04, life and his design process and stuff like that and here's a really cool quote that I found from
4037.04,4040.7999999999997, the story that I just all just read really well I mentioned it was the New Yorker it wasn't a
4040.8,4044.6400000000003, New Yorker if you go to the New Yorker dot com right now you can read the story so an actual high
4044.6400000000003,4050.6400000000003, fullo in high-brow mainstream magazine right did a cool story on gaming very cool okay so here's okay so
4050.6400000000003,4057.6000000000004, that's increasingly common by the way yeah well especially when you have like someone like will
4057.6000000000004,4061.36, will write who's just lens and stuff like intelligent conversation about like you just this
4061.36,4066.7200000000003, bit beyond just game theory right just life in general I mean okay anyway so here's the quote
4066.72,4070.8799999999997, wheel has a reality distortion field around him his former business partner Jeff Braun told the New
4070.8799999999997,4076.08, Yorker um he comes up with a craziest idea you've ever heard and when he's finished explaining it to you
4076.08,4081.12, that world looks crazy and he's the only sane person in it and you know that that that that's a crazy
4081.12,4087.68, spot and that's a pretty simple idea yeah so I'm not gonna still need more thunder from the New Yorker
4087.68,4093.4399999999996, go read the story it's awesome so we're just like pimping other yeah pretty much show it but that's okay
4093.44,4097.84, you gotta get props for their deal you do have to give props for their do especially when you hate
4097.84,4103.68, everybody's which is we and uh this is love to I'm just gonna throw out a couple of the quick ones
4103.68,4107.6, just quick news stories so in the past we've kind of made at least I made fun of a cool
4107.6,4112.64, reality games for kind of making war games based off of conflicts that I rack and I ran and whatnot
4113.4400000000005,4118.16, and they are partnering with the history channel for their show uh the hell's the name of the show
4118.24,4123.599999999999, shootout so basically starting this uh this Friday they're gonna have their show is which recreate
4123.599999999999,4127.68, basically famous battles which range from the you would jam it the battle the ball is the
4127.68,4134.639999999999, tent offensive and comeryality game is gonna have a 3D recreation game of that of each episode of their
4134.639999999999,4138.8, show at the same time so it's a totally like from i'm just gonna have a free thing you can just check out
4139.36,4143.599999999999, that's pretty cool so it is got a cool I mean hopefully it'll play out well so uh so that's a nice
4143.6,4147.76, TV game convergence they go on on there so viewers of the show can log on to history.com and
4147.76,4152.08, download the online game for free immediately after each episode of ours so it's an eye not tied
4152.08,4159.120000000001, off the savet's any good but in here how is this he does using 3D using heavy 3D CGI animation sequences
4159.120000000001,4162.56, yeah i don't know I just can experience the thick about from the point of view historical part
4162.56,4168.88, so i think that's a TV show right so it's like well that's the team why not just let's show what
4168.96,4173.92, footage we have you know and and other things you know what's the point of the yeah i think i think
4173.92,4179.04, i think i do for it i mean it's not telegenic well i think it's pretty well well so we'll see on Friday
4179.04,4183.6, i guess yeah i'll have to see but i'll watch exactly after battle start so i mean like so apparently
4183.6,4188.56, the first one it's uh it's an it would jimly episode uh game it game is so it is they're calling it
4189.6,4193.4400000000005, you'll see through the eyes of a u.s. marine singlehandedly overrunning a heavily fortified bunker
4193.4400000000005,4197.04, complex by carry by hand carrying an aircraft shingun into battle
4198.0,4202.64, which apparently is too late for fire yeah yeah it's hilarious and i just seems like one of the
4202.64,4207.28, it's like just wait for all in only three health packs exactly i can i was like i'm like reading
4207.28,4211.12, this thinking of wolf inside three days i'm like how realistic is this but you know if it
4211.12,4215.68, happened to be secret doors like in wolf instead i sure hope so so you know there you go a little
4215.68,4220.8, little freebie shout out and uh you know what hell i'm not even about talking about postal 3
4220.8,4225.92, because oh god they're actually making it they're making it for xbox 360 and the pc with the
4226.0,4231.12, source engine okay that's that's important so you know i mean maybe this time third third time
4231.12,4236.32, will be the charm here that's right maybe at maybe that actually not had to get zero stars this time
4236.96,4241.76, they like the zero stars of course we totally totally played into their hands on that one right
4241.76,4246.4, i mean i would have given them a point five just to pick pizom off the zero was a bad jav honor
4246.4,4252.4, yeah well it works in the same way like if a movie if a movie that is intentionally
4252.4,4257.839999999999, supposed to be low budget slot and it gets like a sea i was like it but if it gets like an effort
4257.839999999999,4261.679999999999, if mine is you're like it would got something here there was some movie a little while ago that did
4261.679999999999,4267.2, that they took all the bad quotes and they put it on there the front in there add let me remember David
4267.2,4273.36, Lynch put uh we've written Cisco's Cisco and he birds two thumbs down and the last highway
4273.36,4282.08, poster did they really wow yeah we got it we got to start doing that like you know when we
4282.08,4287.2, give a game of bad review let's suggest they use this quote you know you won't play a worst game all
4287.2,4299.2, year gfw tough choice this game are syphilis out just different all right are we done with with
4299.2,4305.28, what the cranky this week's cranky podcast we want to read some do some reader questions we
4305.28,4310.64, got some we have a couple how long we have been podcast in here mr. power and 15 holy crap
4310.64,4317.92, we're not a control this week totally our wow it's wacky okay how about a reader
4317.92,4322.56, quote or did that just have it not be about review scores okay okay well it's about reviews but
4322.56,4330.0, not about score all right right no what is it the not complaining about what we said about a game
4330.0,4336.0, no no no no no it's just asking just I'm worried that at the moment okay no it's a good question
4336.0,4341.76, okay almond asks does the deadline in your case ever taken away the fun and pleasure of playing games
4341.76,4346.48, be a short termed you know I can imagine you're reviewing this one terrific game but knowing
4346.48,4350.72, there are two more games to review you kind of have to hurry through the whole or deal that is a
4350.72,4355.6, great question and I wrestle with us all the time we've talked about it we have a tough
4356.48,4361.52, well just that like for the most part we're pretty fortunate here in that not no single one of
4361.52,4367.120000000001, a several reviews that right games right and even one like one long game right I'm playing
4367.120000000001,4371.68, like I have to make sure I'm not getting frustrated just because I need to hurry because I know
4371.68,4375.92, I still need to write it right when it's day's coming right part of it is some games it just
4375.92,4379.280000000001, aren't meant to be rushed through you have to like you know kick a sip everyone's while you play
4379.280000000001,4383.040000000001, a little bit you walk away you come back later yeah and your experience differs too because of
4383.040000000001,4388.160000000001, it like I was talking about condemned it was like I I quite enjoyed it playing it on my own free time
4388.16,4392.4, and you know where the complaints were that it was super short and it was monotonous it was like
4392.4,4396.639999999999, I never played more than a level at a time but I played it over you know over the course of a couple
4396.639999999999,4400.88, weeks whereas if I had sat down and I know I would have probably done the whole game in a five hour
4400.88,4405.12, sitting it would have been monotonous. Oh there was a question do you think you should just play a
4405.12,4408.72, game like one level of the time like you finish a level okay I'm done that's like it's like an episode
4408.72,4412.32, of a show I'm gonna walk away just in a possible question to answer I mean it's been the
4412.32,4417.28, game or play it that way too right they'll rush through it because I always with the half-life game
4417.36,4421.599999999999, I always try to do it in one setting I always just because I really want to keep playing
4421.599999999999,4426.8, but like condemned in that case it was just like so like a environment was just so oppressive and
4426.8,4432.48, it was so like I just didn't want to like you know frame my nerves anymore with
4434.5599999999995,4438.08, that's a good question. That's a great question that there's no easy answer for it. There really
4438.08,4441.599999999999, isn't it's just one of the many things that we have to try to keep in mind when we're trying to
4441.599999999999,4446.88, be effective when we're right. It's a part of just know that we are thinking of that when we are
4447.36,4454.08, definitely step away. If I'm feeling like I'm getting annoyed only because I need to rush I will walk away
4454.08,4459.2, from the computer because that's not fair. I would say that the dangers like more significant
4459.2,4462.8, end you know for some freelancers and other outlets you know like when I was in the electron
4462.8,4467.28, game monthly I would sometimes review like 10 games in a month yeah and that's when it really
4467.28,4471.5199999999995, would come then you really have to watch it because you're like especially at the beginning of
4471.5199999999995,4476.88, the cycle you're like okay here's game number one and I've got nine more these things to do and
4477.36,4481.76, if you start dying more than two times on something you really just get furious and you've
4481.76,4486.4800000000005, got to check yourself. I remember when I was doing that for you GM as well I was just like I had a
4486.4800000000005,4490.96, stack of games and I remember killing like Labor Day weekend and I just had like this I'm like
4490.96,4494.72, I kept like getting stuck at a point I just crap on the next game and I would come back later and
4494.72,4499.2, it's a different but that's when I and the like you know music and movie critics where you can
4500.56,4504.8, if you put three hours of investment in a watching it you've got three hours worth of progress
4504.8,4509.28, into it you know there's no guarantees like that with a game with games for us you might
4509.28,4513.360000000001, spend six hours accomplishing what someone else accomplished in an hour for whatever reason
4514.24,4519.6, you know exactly different places we have for games god our jobs are hard no it's not hard
4519.6,4524.72, but I think it is different you know I mean there's nothing yet there's nothing difficult I mean
4524.72,4528.8, there's nothing hard or whatever about it but just in in comparison to some other you know
4528.8,4533.360000000001, right entertainment mediums no I know it is it's it's you need to gaming I think it is very unique
4533.36,4537.12, that's the problem of having an open world or kind of a blank slate you can walk around it
4537.12,4542.96, for a while yeah oh we maybe our time might be up if somebody's now he walked away and
4542.96,4547.5199999999995, we scary it like a guy at the door do we have another reader question before we sign out
4548.5599999999995,4553.44, there's one more it's not as good but but don't say that you can hurt the guys feeling okay it's
4553.44,4558.5599999999995, great it's awesome actually he even says to himself that a game it tends says I have a real question
4558.5599999999995,4562.88, okay this is a real question all right why don't console seem to suffer from
4562.88,4569.12, pirated games as much as PC games do I mean a CD or DVD is the same and the data is just
4569.12,4574.56, ones and zeros I know tons of people that pirate PC games for shame but nobody I know copies are
4574.56,4580.56, uses pirate console games why is this because of the consoles themselves they have like special
4580.56,4586.0, plans that process the CD the game discs so you have to in order to to mod your console
4586.0,4590.8, yeah you have to basically modify and all your warranty and get a chip and a piece of an
4590.8,4594.88, original system and then the sacrifice this is actually another story I'm sure that like maybe
4594.88,4600.0, one of yours podcasts will be talking about right now is that like Microsoft is just avoided a load
4600.0,4606.64, of live accounts because they detected that people had modified their 360s and so the sacrifice
4606.64,4611.92, there is that hey you can burn DVDs and play pirate games on there but you can't play them all
4611.92,4617.360000000001, on yeah so that's success so even for the people and because it's different you know on a PC it's
4617.36,4621.12, like you do whatever you do a little googling and you can get yourself into a position where you
4621.12,4625.839999999999, you know technically have access to certain things whereas again you have to do the googling to
4625.839999999999,4629.2, find where you can get a chip then you have to know how to modify it you have to have some you
4629.2,4632.639999999999, know soldering skills and this and that then you have to be willing to risk like I said
4632.639999999999,4637.36, there's a lot more who's a lot of work just to be a jerk right you know yeah well yeah I mean
4637.36,4642.08, to basically I mean in any case yeah I've hired you something you're just shading on your industry
4642.08,4645.839999999999, it's like yep it's all just like the old you know the old info commercials and the raps about you
4645.84,4650.4800000000005, know don't copy that floppy it's like the bottom line is true it's like yeah that's your right
4650.4800000000005,4654.88, thing don't copy that floppy then don't fucking steal them it is because they're not it's not
4654.88,4659.52, going to be profitable for people to keep making them you know it's just it's simple logic and
4659.52,4664.56, well in the in that case the bromide don't copy that floppy that's some sound wisdom that is true
4664.56,4670.56, dude so there actually a raps song don't copy that floppy yeah I'll put it up I need that
4670.56,4675.04, it's actually it's got an intermission with some developers from never-winner nights talking
4675.04,4679.36, and whatnot too man I need to remix on that shit we'll put up on the forums
4679.36,4685.28, nice all right I think we're getting a sign off here thank you all for sitting in on this
