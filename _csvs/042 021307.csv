30.0,32.0, Hello and welcome!
32.0,34.0, Welcome to GFW Radio.
34.0,36.0," Hey Mr. Collection, friends!"
36.0,37.0, Puberty.
37.0,42.0," This is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of Games horrendous magazine."
42.0,48.0, I'm here with the editorial staff of Games horrendous magazine who are as follows.
48.0,50.0," Ryan Scott, Derek Ladsdon?"
50.0,51.0, John Elliott.
51.0,52.0, John Elliott.
52.0,54.0, I'm going to do that much more manly this week.
54.0,55.0, You sure see?
55.0,58.0, I'm going to give you the Michael Winslow of our staff.
58.0,60.0, Everybody here is a special thing going on this week.
60.0,67.0," Sean's more manly, Darren has a dot on his nose that was bleeding at lunch for an hour straight."
67.0,68.0, That was awesome.
68.0,71.0," This is a great, brilliant ride at a pop-tart."
71.0,72.0, That's gone now.
72.0,75.0," Sean, what do you have to share this week?"
75.0,76.0, Keep it clean.
76.0,77.0, We got nothing.
77.0,78.0, He got nothing.
78.0,80.0, There's my wild talk.
80.0,81.0, A little 70.
81.0,82.0, All done.
82.0,83.0, Woo!
83.0,84.0, Seeing two years.
84.0,85.0, Okay.
85.0,94.0," So to get right into it this week, we are going to have a very special podcast all about you this week."
94.0,97.0, We have compiled over a bunch of months.
97.0,103.0," A lot of questions from youth folks listening and because we're the bastards we are, we never actually answer it."
103.0,106.0, They've been some great questions all along.
106.0,113.0, So we thought partially because we didn't prepare this week that we would spend the time answering your questions.
113.0,116.0, And hopefully get some good discussion out of that.
116.0,121.0," And if we know a good discussion, maybe we'll get some good, you know, fart noises and jokes and burps."
121.0,123.0," You get one or the other, but not both."
123.0,124.0, Not both.
124.0,126.0, Or maybe we'll try both at the same time.
126.0,127.0, We could try.
127.0,128.0, Yeah.
128.0,129.0, Let's see.
129.0,131.0, So we're getting ready.
131.0,133.0," We're already, we're all ready."
133.0,134.0, We're derailed.
134.0,136.0," Well, Sean, I think you're going to start us off."
136.0,141.0, I started off with the turret explosion like you can supply the rest.
141.0,144.0, We'll say that from when Robert is a guest.
144.0,146.0," Oh, so."
146.0,148.0," Okay, getting right into it first."
148.0,150.0, We said we're going to deal with questions.
150.0,155.0," Yes, but we lied just because we're going to deal with some comment that kind of speaks for itself and we can comment on the comment."
155.0,160.0," But are one of our favorite message board posters, Bally, Hi, Bally."
160.0,161.0, For the win.
161.0,162.0, There's a great comment.
163.0,175.0," He, someone asked about, you know, why don't we talk more about live achievements, live anywhere achievements up because as we know, Halo 2 for PC will be the first game to officially offer achievement points on live."
175.0,180.0," And delivering, you know, in true form he came in and suggested, you're like,"
180.0,182.0, And that will just give him the voice.
182.0,183.0, It just reads better that way.
183.0,185.0," Sorry, Bally, maybe you actually sound more like,"
186.0,193.0," Woo, woo, my favorite, but of course, in my world, Bally sounds like."
193.0,197.0, Can't wait for those PC achievements.
197.0,200.0," Number one, managed to install game."
200.0,203.0," Number two, it's updated the latest patch."
203.0,208.0," Number three, reach the frame rate higher than 20 for two full seconds."
208.0,213.0," Number four, all tapped and resume successfully."
213.0,216.0," Number five, no CTD on startup."
216.0,221.0," Number six, didn't have to reinstall video card drivers."
221.0,223.0," Number seven, you sound worked."
223.0,228.0," So thanks to the Bally, those are all future worthwhile."
228.0,229.0, You have to be very funny.
229.0,231.0," Okay, yeah, it was all this."
231.0,233.0," It didn't even, I could read them in a normal,"
233.0,238.0," Bally sit, reader Bally says, I'll be excited when I manage to install a game."
238.0,240.0, I'll be excited when I update.
241.0,245.0," Still be, no, we wouldn't be laughing, but yeah, good point."
245.0,248.0," So that out of the way, anyone else want to add any favorite."
248.0,250.0, What do you hope in the get in the achievement for?
250.0,254.0," Actually, should we open up to the do we actually give a rat to us about a cheap and points in PC gaming?"
254.0,259.0," Here's, here's, here's the perfect, let's just like tie it into the, to one of the main questions."
259.0,265.0," We have two chief questions for the day, and this will just sit, I'll read it and go right back to you."
265.0,266.0, Okay.
266.0,270.0, One reader wants to know Lily Iris.
270.0,273.0," Hey guys, recently I went back and listening to podcast."
273.0,275.0," Wow, every one of our readers is a key."
275.0,278.0," It's a Lily, I'm never going to write it again."
278.0,279.0," Okay, hold on."
279.0,280.0, We'll switch it to the other voice.
280.0,284.0," Hey guys, it's in a list of podcasts where you're nuts,"
284.0,287.0, you'd be moving from CGW to games for Windows.
287.0,292.0," Maybe truly for you to answer this question, but maybe after six issues under your belt,"
293.0,295.0, you can tell us how you think you're doing.
295.0,296.0, Is anything changed?
296.0,298.0, The magazine that you like?
298.0,299.0, Anything that you don't like?
299.0,301.0, I feel like I'm answering a question from Snuffle Lopikas.
301.0,302.0, Can I help you?
302.0,303.0, I can help you.
303.0,308.0," In a podcast that we said we're dividing to the reader, we not to spend all time making fun of them."
308.0,309.0," Okay, I'm just reading."
309.0,311.0, That's a nice question.
311.0,313.0," I told you the option, okay, you want my straight reading voice?"
313.0,314.0, Yes.
314.0,320.0," Hey guys, recently I went back and listening to the podcast where you announced that you would be moving from CGW to games for Windows."
320.0,324.0," Maybe too early for you to answer this question, but maybe after you have another six issues under your belt,"
324.0,327.0, you can tell us how you think you're doing.
327.0,330.0, Is anyone has anything changed in the magazine that you like?
330.0,331.0, Anything you don't like?
331.0,333.0, How's your new stand presence these days?
333.0,335.0," You guys seem worried that people with, I think you were selling out."
335.0,336.0, Have you?
336.0,339.0," So then, Darren, back to you in terms of, I was just, the connection,"
339.0,343.0," if you're wondering where it is is that we just got done, you know,"
343.0,346.0," ripping on, or reading one of our readers ripping on,"
346.0,350.0," Xbox live, it's genius or Windows achievements."
350.0,354.0," And so I think I was just thinking that says something about us like,"
354.0,356.0," I mean, we have this whole thing to talk about."
356.0,359.0, What is our relationship with Microsoft and how is it shaped?
359.0,360.0," Yeah, we are and all this stuff."
360.0,362.0," And I got comments on that too, but go ahead, Darren."
362.0,364.0," Well, I guess, well, I mean, it's kind of really,"
364.0,367.0," well, three topics really, I mean, individually like Tom had, like,"
367.0,371.0, especially specifically Xbox achievement points.
371.0,374.0," I mean, really there's so many different ways you can go."
374.0,376.0," So we're off with, like, just the larger picture."
376.0,380.0," Because it seems to be a Shanghai, you want to talk about what you think of achievements."
380.0,384.0," That was thinking, like, saying, well, in some, let it not be the case that,"
384.0,386.0," like, because, well, I mean, like, we are from, I mean,"
386.0,389.0," we've said this to, like, to we're blue in the face of bunch of times,"
389.0,391.0," how we, we are completely independent and like,"
391.0,393.0," and it's kind of refreshing in that, you know,"
393.0,395.0," Microsoft hasn't, like, turned the screws on us for, like,"
395.0,397.0," saying, you know, giving us crap for anything we say or do."
397.0,398.0, Right.
398.0,400.0," The fact that we're saying that reading that should say that, like,"
400.0,402.0, that's one thing that hasn't changed.
402.0,403.0, Right.
403.0,404.0," So, it's not there."
404.0,408.0," Like, Microsoft has been so good in that we haven't heard a single thing from them about,"
408.0,410.0, because you changed the message.
410.0,412.0," Could you, I mean, it's been so quiet."
412.0,413.0, It's so scary.
413.0,414.0, So good.
414.0,416.0," It's like, first of all, are they even reading it?"
416.0,417.0, Right.
417.0,420.0," Second, are they just so mad that they don't even know what to do?"
420.0,421.0," Like, we created a monster."
421.0,426.0," Or it doesn't matter because then when we flip and we say that we like something,"
426.0,428.0," it means everyone else that, you know,"
428.0,430.0," listening or something, it's like, hey, there's really something,"
430.0,432.0," maybe there's something to take a look at here,"
432.0,434.0," because aren't bullshit, you know, the bullshit."
434.0,437.0," I mean, hopefully, I mean, really, we're kidding,"
437.0,442.0," but hopefully it's actually that it's the best possible scenario that they're,"
442.0,444.0," they're reading it or listening to us here,"
444.0,448.0, here us being sort of having some dissension and not caring.
448.0,449.0, Right.
449.0,450.0, When that be great.
450.0,451.0, Yeah.
451.0,453.0," It's like, hey, what's it's not what's it going to do?"
453.0,456.0," I mean, I mean, I mean, I always operate from the under the assumption they wanted us,"
456.0,459.0, because we were such a vocal independent voice.
460.0,462.0," And now we just were kind of like pushing the brand,"
462.0,465.0, but we're also still kind of calling it as we see it all along.
465.0,467.0, We haven't changed anything really.
467.0,470.0," Because, you know, we do love games for Windows."
470.0,471.0, We'll be sorry.
471.0,472.0," And this is the only kind of,"
472.0,474.0, a little bit count the money we just got from saying that.
474.0,477.0," Another interesting thing is, is not only that we haven't heard"
477.0,479.0," for Microsoft about, you know, these sorts of things,"
479.0,481.0, but we haven't heard anything from readers.
481.0,483.0," You would think that you take, you know,"
483.0,486.0," and gamers in general, I think, want the slot,"
486.0,490.0," you want to accuse you of bias or being sold out or anything with,"
490.0,492.0," for any reason whatsoever, you know,"
492.0,495.0," every like, you know, when I would accept letters for, you know,"
495.0,497.0," each year or something, part of that's because there's more and more"
497.0,499.0," and platform and every other letter is like,"
499.0,501.0," you're by, so again, so any, no, you're by, so again,"
501.0,503.0," say, I spot, you're by, so again, you know,"
503.0,506.0," but for us, we didn't get any, and for having readers,"
506.0,508.0," some of them for years and years and years,"
508.0,510.0, and you do something like that and you flip it.
510.0,512.0, And there were skepticism beforehand.
512.0,514.0," Yeah, the hate came before for which."
514.0,515.0, And then we did it.
515.0,517.0," And no one said, you know what?"
517.0,518.0, You ask holes or foolish shit.
518.0,520.0, This is like a money hat magazine.
520.0,522.0," Right. You know, I mean, no one did that."
522.0,524.0, Right. So that's pretty cool.
524.0,526.0, I think it was really good about that.
526.0,527.0, Because we think it was pretty cool.
527.0,528.0, Like we came up swinging.
528.0,530.0," We didn't, we basically, we're just going to"
530.0,532.0," different code of paint on some of the stories,"
532.0,534.0," but otherwise, we've said the same things."
534.0,536.0, We haven't really changed our tune or anything.
536.0,538.0," I mean, I know, I wouldn't say I've gone out of my way"
538.0,540.0," to bash Microsoft products extra hard,"
540.0,542.0," but I mean, it's not like I've, you know, pulled a bunches."
542.0,546.0, I think I can honestly say that I like kind of forget that we're like some like a
546.0,548.0, quote unquote official magazine.
548.0,551.0," Like I'm just, because I've been here along a long, long time."
551.0,553.0," Right. And to me, it's just like the same magazine"
553.0,555.0, about what he's worked on.
555.0,557.0," Right. Like everyone's around like, oh, shit, we have that like official"
557.0,560.0," tag. But like, I don't even know what that means."
560.0,561.0, Exactly. Yeah.
561.0,563.0, Because a lot of people probably don't want you say that.
563.0,565.0, Maybe I'm not supposed to say it.
565.0,566.0, So it is on edit that out.
566.0,569.0, I know exactly what it means.
569.0,571.0, And I have a vision prior both prior to the change.
571.0,575.0," And post, you know, now talking with, you know, developers, PR people."
575.0,579.0," And they all say, so hey, how's it going? How's the, how's the transition"
579.0,583.0, and stuff? Yeah. And this was one reason why I wanted to bring this up
583.0,587.0," because yeah, it's like it reminds me. I was like, oh, yeah, we did just like"
587.0,591.0," like, I mean, if we were every month fighting like a huge army of people that"
591.0,595.0," were saying like, you guys like really messed up. I can't believe you did this"
595.0,599.0," or on the other hand, like we were hearing, okay, stay on message, you know,"
599.0,602.0, some kind of editorial influence or something. Yeah.
602.0,605.0," So it's like, that's really awesome."
605.0,609.0," It has, we're, you know, your Jeff year, what some people might have assumed"
609.0,613.0," would be lip service before the change was that our party line was, hey,"
613.0,616.0, we're getting all the benefits of associating ourselves with
616.0,619.0," Microsoft and having like enhanced presence on new stands,"
619.0,621.0, but they're not going to control our content.
621.0,624.0," And it's like, it's what you said. And it's what we got."
624.0,626.0, And that's really cool. But it's so surprising.
626.0,627.0, It was so smooth that you didn't really.
627.0,631.0," Well, I mean, that's why I felt it. And I think all you guys did two"
631.0,634.0," felt so confident about the change. I mean, when people were"
634.0,637.0," racking on us on the message boards or crying or whatever it was,"
637.0,641.0," I never felt any sort of, you know, I was very"
641.0,645.0," confident that they were just going to be wrong because, you know,"
645.0,649.0," you had faith in us, Jeff. I faith in us. Well, what we're"
649.0,653.0," going to do, right? I mean, seriously, if some kind of like hammer came down,"
653.0,656.0," I just, I honestly don't think we'd be here."
656.0,659.0, I wouldn't be here. Right. I would have just said screw it. Okay.
659.0,662.0," This wasn't the deal I made. Yeah, exactly. Now, but, you know,"
662.0,666.0," it just never, I never had any question that was going to be that way."
666.0,671.0," You know, another thing on this subject that I want to say is that"
671.0,674.0," I think it's important that we don't fall on the other thing where it's like,"
674.0,677.0," you're that, you know, I compared it today at lunch to the rich kid at school."
677.0,681.0, And everyone knows that kids dad is like a millionaire. So he's like a
682.0,685.0," little, he's like a little, he has an in the class, just improve that life."
685.0,688.0," It's just the proof that he's not, you know, the silver spoon kid."
688.0,690.0," And I don't think like, is here we are."
690.0,694.0," So I think, I think, selectively quoted us right on VISTA launch."
694.0,697.0," Yep. And the reason I only said, I stand by everything we said,"
697.0,699.0," set by also, it wasn't quoted. I also said,"
699.0,702.0, VISTA is a no-brainer once direct X 10 games are out.
702.0,704.0, And that's good. Yeah. We've all said that in the lesson.
704.0,707.0," But that was like, instead, that, all we got quoted one was like,"
707.0,710.0," hey, it's out. We're not getting it right. Right. That's very said."
710.0,713.0," It's like give us direct X 10 games to play with it. And yeah, we're all over."
713.0,716.0," You know, right. But I agree with you. But like for live achievements, it's like it's not,"
716.0,721.0," it's not like, oh, we got to go and rip on this stuff. It's like, I'm just consistent."
721.0,725.0," You know, I thought they were silly on Xbox. I really appreciate them."
725.0,730.0," And I think, yay, I'm totally for it because it's going to make more people pay attention"
730.0,733.0, to how often they've game on their PC and stuff like that.
733.0,736.0," So I'm all for that, but personally, you got to, I mean, I don't know."
736.0,738.0," I just, it's like, but that's just the same."
738.0,741.0," I can make some achievements in general. Yeah, not silly against a PC."
741.0,744.0," Yeah, they don't, it's just, it's just achievements in general."
744.0,747.0," It's that Homer Simpson bucks from like when they when the episode with a good,"
747.0,751.0," she has scratchy land. And they're like, you want to buy it? She has scratchy"
751.0,754.0, dollars. Their twice is fun. And then he goes into the parking.
754.0,756.0," It's like, no, it's scratchy dollars accepted here."
756.0,757.0, As whole.
757.0,763.0," They've got a whole big lot of, that's, but yeah, that's my point of achievement."
763.0,765.0," They're, what are you going to do with it? Well, the only thing,"
765.0,768.0," I mean, well, the thing is actually, I think, with achievement points on Xbox live,"
768.0,772.0," like for the console side, I think they're offering a prizes now if you get a,"
772.0,776.0," so it's like, it's like, it's like, it, like redemption thing where you play"
776.0,778.0, scheme. You get it to throw.
778.0,779.0, You get it to throw.
779.0,782.0," Yeah, why don't you like, can be a wallpaper."
782.0,784.0, A screen gun that's got to leak in it. You get a bottle like two squirts.
784.0,785.0, We got to refill it.
785.0,787.0, You're going to put up prices. Are they?
787.0,788.0," Oh, a bomb hit Jay Allard."
788.0,789.0, I don't know.
790.0,791.0, The thing with that.
791.0,795.0," Yeah, you buy and beat like 70 games, and you get a,"
795.0,796.0, will be cushioned.
796.0,798.0," Actually, I think you bet like, you have a free, like a free download of a game,"
798.0,800.0," or something. You know, stuff like that, like little things here and there."
800.0,803.0," A free download of a game now, really, that's pretty good."
803.0,804.0," Oh, that's pretty good."
804.0,805.0," So if, like, like, an arcade game."
805.0,808.0," Not a, a clock, I'm not sure of a specific, but I think it's like, you know,"
808.0,811.0," if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, like, classic game or something,"
811.0,812.0," that's still cool, though."
812.0,813.0, Yeah.
813.0,814.0, But that is something.
814.0,817.0," But they need to apply something like that, an actual use for those"
817.0,818.24, for those achievement points.
818.24,819.52," I'm with you, Sean."
819.52,820.72, Like I think it's kind of cool
820.72,823.88," and it kind of lets you recognize getting a high score,"
823.88,826.04, but also being able to apply those points towards something.
826.04,827.12, That's what I said in a minute.
827.12,830.28, What I found in my experience with the achievements
830.28,832.96, was in a kind of cool way.
832.96,835.8, There were a couple games I played like Dead Rising
835.8,840.8, and Viva Pinata that I was playing them differently
840.8,842.16, because I was trying to unlock.
842.16,843.48," Yeah, that's certain achievements."
843.48,844.56," That's what I thought was,"
844.56,846.12, but I thought that was kind of cool.
846.12,847.24, So you're there who's the one
847.24,848.8, it's so damn successful.
848.8,851.76," I got to make myself and I actually like,"
851.76,856.52, I feel like it's a strange outside influence on game design
856.52,858.52," that will make me, wouldn't be there."
858.52,859.36, You're right.
859.36,861.5600000000001, Did they put these monkey faces in this simply
861.5600000000001,864.4," because I have to find 20 monkey faces for,"
864.4,865.24," yeah, you're right."
865.24,866.52," It is kind of an artificial thing,"
866.52,868.5600000000001," probably outside what the developers,"
868.5600000000001,873.8," well, they've done it in this game in the past"
873.8,875.52, before the achievement point system was in place.
875.52,876.92," I mean, they've always had like,"
876.92,879.92, look for the comic book page hidden somewhere around.
879.92,880.28," Yeah, right."
880.28,880.64, Right.
880.64,881.84," Well, I'm not like a bad idea."
881.84,883.04," What I like about it in the end,"
883.04,884.64," I see it when there's not really,"
884.64,886.16," well, they don't think that artificial,"
886.16,888.6, artificial inflates the life of the game.
888.6,890.3199999999999," Yeah, but like, why is that a bad thing?"
890.3199999999999,891.3199999999999, I don't care.
891.3199999999999,893.1999999999999," It's about my feelings when I play,"
893.1999999999999,895.1999999999999, I feel like I accomplished stuff.
895.1999999999999,898.0799999999999," And I feel like I want to keep looking, say,"
898.0799999999999,899.88, my laptop is just a bad game.
899.88,901.28, I have a game that's too.
901.28,902.16," I was playing, when I was playing,"
902.16,904.92," here's a war co-op, my friend."
904.92,907.56," And he was like, he could tell,"
907.56,909.28," like, as you pick up cog tags in that."
909.28,910.28, Yeah.
910.28,912.12," And there's a part where like the other,"
912.12,914.36, you need the co-op player to turn the flashlight
914.36,916.12, in the area where you can go get it.
916.12,917.9599999999999," And I was like, like, hey, you know,"
917.9599999999999,919.76," where can you put the, and he's just like,"
919.76,922.8399999999999," no, because all I do is bitch about it."
922.8399999999999,924.6," So he's like, I was just waiting for him,"
924.6,926.16," like, okay, I'll walk you over there with it."
926.16,927.6, And then just rip the flashlight off.
927.6,928.48, So the locus come down.
928.48,929.3199999999999," I mean, that nothing."
929.3199999999999,930.48, You wouldn't do it because he was trying to get you
930.48,931.6, to wien you off the attention.
931.6,933.48," Because he was just, or to get me to be consistent."
933.48,935.0," He's like, no, I don't want you to have that cog"
935.0,936.0, in a distance.
936.0,937.6," Once you grab that thing, you know, he's like,"
937.6,938.44, you preach it.
938.44,940.24," He's like, you ain't getting it."
940.24,941.24," So basically, you want to get it."
941.24,942.24, You can't get it.
942.24,943.08, You did work too.
943.08,944.64," Because I was like, hey, it's just right there."
944.64,945.76, He's already on the flashlight.
945.76,946.76, I could take two steps.
946.76,947.6, Why?
947.6,948.44, Why did you?
948.44,949.28, I did feel bad.
949.28,949.8000000000001, I didn't feel stupid afterwards.
949.8000000000001,950.76," I was like, I don't need that."
950.76,951.9200000000001, It's like picking up a penny.
951.9200000000001,954.0400000000001," And you think no one's looking and someone looks,"
954.0400000000001,954.88, you got it.
954.88,955.72, You got it.
955.72,957.36, With the 30S penny in your head.
957.36,958.76, So like fools look at you.
958.76,960.5600000000001," You like, drop back down again."
960.5600000000001,962.72," It also does, I thought it was a super door."
962.72,964.04, It pulls me out a bit.
964.04,965.76," Like, when you see, I'm talking"
965.76,966.6800000000001, really ex-box life here.
966.6800000000001,968.4, Because it's not obviously having played on the PC.
968.4,970.16," But right, when you see that, you know,"
970.16,972.24, the Xbox logo pop up in the movie screen
972.24,973.52, that has achieved an unlocked.
973.52,975.64," And then suddenly I'm like, oh, I'm,"
975.64,976.92," so to totally, I'm not a lobbyist."
976.92,978.24, I'm their target audience.
978.24,979.48," Every time I get one of those, I go,"
979.48,981.72," yeah, you want that thing."
981.72,982.8000000000001," I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,"
982.8000000000001,983.88," you want to be that shitty,"
983.88,986.16," you are, and Microsoft's the voice in the background,"
986.16,988.24," but, good boy, good boy."
988.24,991.76," And the guy who made the deal with Microsoft,"
991.76,992.88, so maybe so.
992.88,996.3199999999999," Your company Jeff, your business magazine, then."
996.3199999999999,998.6, Maybe I got in the case that's actually
998.6,1001.16, an CGW actually for your dog.
1001.16,1002.8, I think that's another problem with that.
1002.8,1005.8399999999999," When you made the deal, it's saying for your dog"
1005.8399999999999,1008.3199999999999, to not like crap on the carpet is the achievement.
1008.3199999999999,1010.04, And that's like a real achievement.
1010.04,1012.4," Do you like, do you want to be the crap on the carpet?"
1012.4,1013.4, I don't know.
1013.4,1014.24, I don't know.
1014.24,1015.3199999999999, I like it in Dead Rising
1015.32,1017.0," because, because Dead Rising,"
1017.0,1020.96," I found a Times, the linear storyline itself would frustrate me."
1020.96,1022.12, And it would make me want to quit.
1022.12,1023.48," And then I would go, okay, well,"
1023.48,1026.0800000000002," instead, I'm just going to go kill the 20,"
1026.0800000000002,1028.48, I'm going to put funny hats on 20 of the guys
1028.48,1029.76, and get that achievement.
1029.76,1030.6000000000001, Do you get the money?
1030.6000000000001,1031.6000000000001, Do you get the money?
1031.6000000000001,1033.28, Of course I wouldn't do that otherwise.
1033.28,1034.1200000000001, No.
1034.1200000000001,1035.8, Do you any of you guys play multiplayer?
1035.8,1036.96, Games a lot on Xbox Live?
1036.96,1037.8, No.
1037.8,1041.64," What if, what if, like, you get a book, say for example,"
1041.64,1042.8, you just go get any book you want.
1042.8,1044.48," And then in the back page,"
1044.48,1045.52," there's like a section that says,"
1045.52,1049.24," go through the book in circle, like every other life."
1049.24,1052.8," You know, circle the word pandemonium, like 20 times."
1052.8,1054.64," And then you know, you get an achievement for that."
1054.64,1057.4," Or like go and find paragraphs that have,"
1057.4,1058.6," you know, 50 words."
1058.6,1059.6, I'll give you a good example.
1059.6,1061.04," There's a, there's a, yeah,"
1061.04,1063.92," young kid series or teen,"
1063.92,1066.4, Queen books called Artemis Fowl.
1066.4,1067.44," And then if you've heard of the series,"
1067.44,1069.08," it's like, sounds fiego."
1069.08,1071.24," No, no, it's a good series by this Irish writer."
1071.24,1073.56," And it, it got popular because a Harry Potter"
1073.6,1075.6399999999999, but it's totally not Harry Potter.
1075.6399999999999,1078.0," Anyway, he's, it's about this 12 year old"
1078.0,1079.12, criminal mastermind.
1079.12,1080.2, And it's a pretty great series.
1080.2,1081.84," But at the bottom of each book,"
1081.84,1086.1599999999999, he has a code that goes throughout the entire book.
1086.1599999999999,1088.24," Like, so the book starts from the cover."
1088.24,1089.56, And it goes all the way to the back.
1089.56,1091.28," Yeah, it's basically by more, you know,"
1091.28,1093.76, but by more Artemis Fowl books.
1093.76,1094.9199999999998, But by the serial.
1094.9199999999998,1096.8, But the code is there at the bottom.
1096.8,1099.6799999999998," And when I had pneumonia, I actually like spent one day"
1099.6799999999998,1101.12, like crack in that whole code.
1101.12,1102.96," So see, I don't have to have a moment."
1102.96,1104.6000000000001," Boy, G G F E."
1104.6000000000001,1106.16, You're actually really quite the code.
1106.16,1109.04," And I did, and I am we cheated on the internet."
1109.04,1111.6000000000001," Guys, well, that's the only code's better than the one."
1111.6000000000001,1112.24," Wait, wait, wait, wait."
1112.24,1113.32, You went on a new way.
1113.32,1115.32," Hey, I'm like a internet that gives it a hint."
1115.32,1118.92, Is there an Artemis Fowl wiki for the site for?
1118.92,1122.56," The trouble with trollbook.com, whatever they got."
1122.56,1123.1200000000001, That's what it was.
1123.1200000000001,1124.28, That's the last degree to go.
1124.28,1125.04, It's the last degree to go.
1125.04,1125.88, Yeah.
1125.88,1126.88, Trid carefully from my friend.
1126.88,1128.16," So yeah, so the answer is, yeah."
1128.16,1129.88," So if there was a fun thing to do in a book,"
1129.88,1130.72, I would do it.
1130.72,1131.8," You could just like, did do it."
1131.8,1134.1599999999999," You really were sick, Joe."
1134.1599999999999,1135.6, It was my fever.
1135.6,1136.04, I don't know.
1136.04,1137.2, It's what?
1137.2,1139.84, Am I the only defender of Xbox Live achievements
1139.84,1140.56, in this podcast?
1140.56,1142.36, Sean was going on the soccer.
1142.36,1143.9199999999998, I'm torn.
1143.9199999999998,1145.9199999999998, Psychologically torn.
1145.9199999999998,1146.2, I hear it.
1146.2,1148.52," It's artificial, but I guess it just doesn't bother"
1148.52,1150.6399999999999, that it slatter on hand whenever you start to fall off.
1150.6399999999999,1152.04, I'm like a completeist.
1152.04,1154.76," Like so if I don't get it, it does run me."
1154.76,1155.3999999999999," Oh, father."
1155.3999999999999,1157.84," So if you don't get them all, right?"
1157.84,1159.68," So that's why when I have to get this stuff,"
1159.68,1161.08, I don't see the key there.
1161.08,1162.8799999999999," So if you're gonna rent them, you resent them."
1162.8799999999999,1163.72, I do resent them.
1163.72,1166.0, So basically anyone that suffers from OCD should not bother playing
1166.0,1167.36, Xbox 360 games.
1167.36,1170.6799999999998," So if you beat the game, I like to pray because like"
1170.6799999999998,1172.84, I'm giving a achievement for like beating a level.
1172.84,1173.6799999999998, Right.
1173.6799999999998,1174.96, Of course I'm gonna do that anyway.
1174.96,1175.96, Those are good at you.
1175.96,1178.6799999999998," But okay, let's say you beat a game 100%."
1178.6799999999998,1180.12, They're actual real game.
1180.12,1182.36, And they didn't get any achievements with the completest
1182.36,1185.12, in you feel like you completed and beat the game.
1185.12,1186.4399999999998," Like it's like, it's a highlight."
1186.4399999999998,1187.84," Like the analogy to the book,"
1187.84,1190.8799999999999, like trying to underscore this fundamental difference
1190.88,1193.0400000000002, disparity between games and other media.
1193.0400000000002,1194.24, Like same thing if you're in the theater
1194.24,1196.6000000000001, and you're like a thing flashes on the screen.
1196.6000000000001,1199.0," You've successfully watched 20 minutes of,"
1199.0,1201.0," you know, I mean, I don't care"
1201.0,1202.68, because I'm not afraid to prove that I could sit
1202.68,1203.8400000000001, through this piece of shit.
1203.8400000000001,1205.0400000000002," I mean, that's really, she's like,"
1205.0400000000002,1208.0400000000002," yeah, to respond to a respond to the story,"
1208.0400000000002,1210.8000000000002," look at the performances, all the various reasons"
1210.8000000000002,1212.2800000000002, you look at whatever the media is.
1212.2800000000002,1213.64," I'll tell you, I would like to give you."
1213.64,1214.96," Like you need, you like, I mean,"
1214.96,1216.6000000000001," that's one of the key things,"
1216.6000000000001,1219.1200000000001, one of the key measures of success of a game
1219.12,1222.04, is like feeling like you accomplished something.
1222.04,1223.56, And like I guess it's not good enough.
1223.56,1226.04," The story, like it's not that the narrative is like,"
1226.04,1227.3999999999999," you know, you really did something"
1227.3999999999999,1228.84," or communicating that you,"
1228.84,1230.4799999999998, you caused some great change in the world.
1230.4799999999998,1233.0," But like, it's like breakout that little,"
1233.0,1235.76, you've finished that level.
1235.76,1237.44, You get five points.
1237.44,1238.8, Yeah.
1238.8,1239.64, Yeah.
1239.64,1241.04," Yeah, and you're right."
1241.04,1241.44, Yeah.
1241.44,1243.24," Like I said, I could really care less about the points."
1243.24,1245.08, And as long as like if the points actually had it
1245.08,1247.28," some kind of like use some real application,"
1247.28,1248.32," otherwise, you know, it's like,"
1248.32,1249.16, give me a freaking cookie.
1249.16,1249.84, I don't give a crap.
1249.84,1251.52, It means you just bad as much.
1251.52,1252.12, That's true.
1252.12,1253.64, I would like achievements
1253.64,1255.68," of for sitting through a movie, though,"
1255.68,1257.64, because I sat through two this weekend.
1257.64,1260.72, And both times were terrible experiences.
1260.72,1262.4," And I'm just like, why the fuck do I go to the movie,"
1262.4,1263.24, say anymore?
1263.24,1265.96," It's like I would like, no, the movies were fine."
1265.96,1267.68, But as I would like a 10 point achievement
1267.68,1269.92," for not breaking the skull of the guy in front of me,"
1269.92,1271.24, keep talking to his girlfriend.
1271.24,1272.24, Yeah.
1272.24,1274.24, I'd like another five points for the guy
1274.24,1276.52, not to in popcorn in my fucking ear behind me.
1276.52,1279.0800000000002, Or by the road popcorn and coming back to your seat
1279.0800000000002,1280.6000000000001, and having the first word out of your mouth
1280.6000000000001,1282.64, not be about how overpriced the popcorn.
1282.64,1284.96," Yeah, the $5 popcorn."
1284.96,1287.8400000000001," Yeah, I saw children in a man and a couple in front of me."
1287.8400000000001,1290.52, The guy with his wife who felt the need
1290.52,1293.08, to explain every scene as it was gone.
1293.08,1294.48, He just walked through the door.
1294.48,1295.52, Really?
1295.52,1296.72, Did he?
1296.72,1298.36, You're kidding.
1298.36,1299.52, That's my cocaine.
1299.52,1300.36," Oh, is it?"
1300.36,1301.36," What am I, ex-girl?"
1301.36,1303.36," Shut up, mother."
1303.36,1304.6399999999999, What's your movie with us?
1304.6399999999999,1306.48, And she was exactly like that.
1306.48,1308.04," We're like, they think that they can like,"
1308.04,1309.92, influence the outcome of the movie.
1309.92,1310.84," As if it hadn't already,"
1310.84,1311.76, but scripted or recorded.
1311.76,1312.76," Oh, no, no."
1312.76,1314.24," And it's a typical, when it's like,"
1314.24,1315.96," normally if I hear something like that in the theater,"
1315.96,1317.92," it's like, oh, God, this is like more on."
1317.92,1320.04, But it was like the girlfriend's mom.
1320.04,1321.8799999999999," So it was like, you just kind of had to sit there, you know,"
1321.8799999999999,1323.84, and even exactly what you're saying.
1323.84,1327.08," But yeah, anyway, yeah, I get a point if I can move"
1327.08,1328.44, to the discussion back to game.
1328.44,1330.04, We get to today.
1330.04,1331.08," Actually, if we get some of it, we get some of it."
1331.08,1331.92, We get some of it.
1331.92,1334.44, We'll hold the popcorn bag trick.
1334.44,1335.44, OK.
1335.44,1336.28," Yeah, I had to do it."
1336.28,1336.92, Sorry.
1336.92,1339.28," OK, so back to the subject."
1339.28,1340.0, We got more.
1340.0,1341.6, We got plenty more reader questions.
1341.6,1342.12, We do.
1342.12,1343.1599999999999, We done with those questions.
1343.1599999999999,1343.84, I think we're done.
1343.84,1345.8," We, the question, I think we're happy."
1345.8,1348.12, We all happy with the change.
1348.12,1350.0," Are we happy, personally?"
1350.0,1354.12, We definitely are starting to see more eyes on this.
1354.12,1356.12, We get a lot of feedback that people can now find
1356.12,1356.8, this in the store.
1356.8,1358.28, That's right.
1358.28,1362.0," So my mom said, yeah, I actually, and I like the design."
1362.0,1363.12, A lot better.
1363.12,1366.52," I'm happy with the kind of cleaner, wider space that we have now."
1366.52,1370.16," Which we might have done anyway, but the change over the game"
1370.16,1375.68, so when does sort of exacerbated the need to do a redesign.
1375.68,1377.0, So that was cool.
1377.0,1377.8, I'm pleased.
1377.84,1381.28," Yeah, if depending on how things have gone, it could have been a really"
1381.28,1382.56, frustrating time.
1382.56,1385.12, And I'd say I'm really happy the fact that yeah.
1385.12,1386.24," Yeah, it's a natural evolution."
1386.24,1387.12, I see every issue.
1387.12,1387.9199999999998, We're doing a lot more.
1387.9199999999998,1388.9199999999998, A lot of things better.
1388.9199999999998,1391.0," And we're gaining a steam, I think."
1391.0,1395.04, I think we're definitely doing a lot of natural evolution.
1395.04,1397.04, And we're not done yet.
1397.04,1398.1599999999999, So that's the move.
1398.1599999999999,1398.44, OK.
1398.44,1399.6, Next question.
1399.6,1402.28, We got reader all my wants to know.
1402.28,1403.36, How am I?
1403.36,1406.0, What were the initial feelings when you had to do a podcast?
1406.0,1408.44, And how do you feel about it now?
1408.44,1409.44, It surprises.
1409.44,1411.16, One sexy guy that I'll.
1411.16,1412.24," Oh, man."
1412.24,1414.64," He's got a nice, they get a bad signature in everyone."
1414.64,1415.96, Let's not bring it up.
1415.96,1417.4, It's part of part of the server.
1417.4,1418.84," In some jokes, they're message."
1418.84,1419.2, Right.
1419.2,1419.92, It's got to go.
1419.92,1421.76," So once we're done with this, we're going to go get rid of it"
1421.76,1423.44, for him.
1423.44,1425.24," Anyway, so I'll mind again."
1425.24,1428.24," Outside of whatever voice that was wants to know,"
1428.24,1430.24, what are taken on podcasting was when we started
1430.24,1431.76," question, how has it changed?"
1431.76,1435.12," I remember when we did our first one, we just kind of like, well,"
1435.12,1436.4799999999998," we got to do it, I guess."
1436.4799999999998,1437.9599999999998," Well, we definitely, it was one of those things."
1437.9599999999998,1439.8799999999999, It was like imposed upon us.
1439.8799999999999,1442.8799999999999, Like now your duties also include this.
1442.8799999999999,1444.6, They got this whole podcast and thing now.
1444.6,1445.08, Right.
1445.08,1446.04, It's crazy internet.
1446.04,1447.8799999999999, So my mind was usual skepticism.
1447.8799999999999,1450.1999999999998," It was like, why the hell would anyone want to listen to us?"
1450.1999999999998,1450.84, Yeah.
1450.84,1452.3999999999999," Like, that's what I'm shooting."
1452.3999999999999,1453.4799999999998, To a microphone.
1453.4799999999998,1453.76, There.
1453.76,1455.52, They might be wondering that this very second.
1455.52,1456.0, Yeah.
1456.0,1456.1999999999998, Right.
1456.1999999999998,1459.1999999999998," I learned to love that, though."
1459.1999999999998,1460.8, You're going to enjoy what I say.
1460.8,1461.52," Damn it, boy."
1461.52,1462.36, You're going to listen to me.
1462.36,1463.1999999999998, Sit down.
1463.1999999999998,1464.3999999999999, I got a funny voice for you.
1465.3600000000001,1466.2," Yeah, no."
1466.2,1468.8000000000002," No, I think we didn't want to do it."
1468.8000000000002,1471.8000000000002, We kind of resented it because we had a magazine to make.
1471.8000000000002,1474.0, So we had drag our asses down here.
1474.0,1474.76, And I don't know.
1474.76,1477.1200000000001," I actually, I personally like it a lot, too."
1477.1200000000001,1479.76," I mean, one thing it helps us focus during the week."
1479.76,1482.48, Like now I definitely think about things.
1482.48,1483.24, And we all do this.
1483.24,1485.5600000000002," I think, oh, we got to bring that up on the podcast, right?"
1485.5600000000002,1487.48, We'll be talking during the week and things will come out.
1487.48,1489.0800000000002," It's an extra space to, of course,"
1489.0800000000002,1491.0800000000002, and we come down here and just like make fun of the French.
1491.0800000000002,1492.6000000000001, So.
1493.56,1495.36, They get a little derailment on our list too.
1495.36,1495.7199999999998, Yeah.
1495.7199999999998,1496.24, How is it?
1496.24,1497.52, No.
1497.52,1498.84," When we started the whole thing, we also"
1498.84,1502.56," were sure, I mean, we're going to need a schedule that"
1502.56,1505.0," we're going to like operate from, you know, how tight"
1505.0,1506.4399999999998, was everything going to have to be when we
1506.4399999999998,1508.1599999999999, had subjected to anything afterward.
1508.1599999999999,1508.6399999999999, Right.
1508.6399999999999,1509.9599999999998," Oh, how is it just everybody?"
1509.9599999999998,1510.8, Because it's going to work.
1510.8,1511.32, Right.
1511.32,1513.9199999999998, And I think what happened is we just like talked and talked.
1513.9199999999998,1514.36, We don't care.
1514.36,1515.1999999999998, We never added it.
1515.1999999999998,1518.08, You don't care if we say something that sticks.
1518.08,1520.6399999999999, And that seemed like just to set its own rule.
1520.64,1523.24," But over time, I think that's what come like a strength."
1523.24,1523.6000000000001, Yeah.
1523.6000000000001,1524.76, I ended up liking it.
1524.76,1526.24," And there's no, I don't know."
1526.24,1528.24," I mean, compared to like, you can, it would be really easy"
1528.24,1531.24," for us to be overly concerned about every, what's"
1531.24,1534.2," happening on every, any given minute of airtime."
1534.2,1534.4, Yeah.
1534.4,1536.88," I just think like, how did it just be duller because of it?"
1536.88,1537.88, It's a little more sterile.
1537.88,1540.96," I've been on another podcast where I get stopped, like mid sentence"
1540.96,1542.0800000000002, because somebody blew something.
1542.0800000000002,1545.24," And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't want to do it that way."
1545.24,1545.8000000000002, This is too.
1545.8000000000002,1546.2, Can't do it.
1546.2,1546.4, Yeah.
1546.4,1547.64, We had it at the time.
1547.64,1548.4, Let's add it that out.
1548.4,1548.76, Yeah.
1548.76,1549.6000000000001," It's like, here's a glaze."
1549.6,1551.28, We're just listening to Howard's here and show all the time
1551.28,1552.6799999999998, for that exact reason because it was just kind of like
1552.6799999999998,1554.36, extremely conscious and they just kept flowing.
1554.36,1556.4399999999998," And then, yeah, I think that's what it is for me too."
1556.4399999999998,1557.7199999999998, It's like all the radio I like.
1557.7199999999998,1560.52, It's just like people call it the point of it is.
1560.52,1563.48," And we edit the magazine is just like, you know, edit, edit,"
1563.48,1564.6799999999998, maybe that's it too.
1564.6799999999998,1566.8799999999999," So it's like, we don't want to edit anything else."
1566.8799999999999,1569.28, It's coming in like just refreshing.
1569.28,1570.4399999999998, You're right.
1570.4399999999998,1571.9599999999998, Right.
1571.9599999999998,1575.04, We have no advertisers to offend here on the podcast.
1575.04,1576.52," So, right."
1576.52,1579.56," And if we get to defend them, how is your perspective"
1579.56,1583.28, changed if it's changed about podcasting?
1583.28,1584.32, We've gotten a lot better.
1584.32,1590.36," I mean, we used to have a lot of dead silences and kind of awkward moments back"
1590.36,1591.52, when we first started.
1591.52,1593.52, I think we tried to be.
1593.52,1595.9199999999998, They typically were like more formal.
1595.9199999999998,1598.6, We tried to have a more formal structure.
1598.6,1599.6, Yeah.
1599.6,1601.12, And then we figured out that didn't work with us.
1601.12,1603.76," I kind of didn't carry us to go back to those first ones and listen,"
1603.76,1604.76, I'm afraid.
1604.76,1605.6, I so don't want to do that.
1605.6,1606.6, I think that bad.
1606.6,1607.6, Yeah.
1607.6,1608.6, I would be afraid to.
1609.04,1611.3999999999999," I didn't quite have that feeling, but you know, you take everyone's"
1611.3999999999999,1613.36, dreads taking like speech class and college.
1613.36,1616.28," Like a, and there's that one fool who gets up there to do a speech."
1616.28,1617.4399999999998, And he's kind of like box stepping.
1617.4399999999998,1619.1599999999999, You're just like waiting for him to pass out.
1619.1599999999999,1620.7199999999998, It was like this whole speech.
1620.7199999999998,1623.84," Get a five minute like how to speech and it's like how to like,"
1623.84,1625.36, I got to get specific with this analogy.
1625.36,1627.36, It's not going to be anything.
1627.36,1629.0, How to eat a hot pepper.
1629.0,1632.1599999999999, And his whole speech is about you just drink water after you're done.
1632.1599999999999,1634.28, And then like the one when they open it up to questions after the
1634.28,1637.1999999999998, dude's box step for five minutes and like almost passed out.
1637.2,1640.48, So it goes water actually sites the taste buds dumb ass.
1640.48,1641.32, You want to drink milk.
1641.32,1642.88, But it's whole speech.
1642.88,1644.28, That's this is actually a real story.
1644.28,1646.64," By the way, when I was called, I was going to say,"
1646.64,1648.3600000000001, so that was the guy's song and that it will milk you.
1648.3600000000001,1649.0800000000002, What a drink.
1649.0800000000002,1651.0," It's not just sitting out, dude."
1651.0,1652.8, It's stupid shit ever.
1652.8,1653.8, Oh man.
1653.8,1656.2," So anyway, yeah, I kind of felt like it had had a little of that by"
1656.2,1659.2," going, you know, where we're like, help us out here."
1659.2,1660.68," Like, they sit out."
1660.68,1661.68, They sit out.
1661.68,1662.88, Can I sit down yet?
1662.88,1663.88, Yeah.
1663.88,1664.88, We sit out.
1664.88,1665.88, Yeah.
1665.88,1666.88, Anyway.
1667.0400000000002,1667.92, We like the podcast.
1668.92,1673.0, It's the reason we've vanished every once in a while is because we
1673.0,1676.68," record on Mondays, which is like sometimes like the worst possible day"
1676.68,1677.64, for shipping a magazine.
1677.64,1678.0400000000002, Yeah.
1678.0400000000002,1680.5600000000002," So like there's that aspect for the build up to the podcast,"
1680.5600000000002,1683.88," at least for me, it's like, oh, God, I'm going to do a podcast today."
1683.88,1684.4, Right.
1684.64,1686.1200000000001, And then this is where we get down here.
1686.1200000000001,1686.8000000000002, I love it.
1686.8000000000002,1687.4, It's fun.
1687.4,1687.8400000000001, Yeah.
1687.8400000000001,1688.5200000000002, But right.
1688.5200000000002,1690.2800000000002, Like the last Monday was a perfect example.
1690.2800000000002,1692.4, We are literally shipping the magazine.
1692.4,1694.8000000000002," That means, you know, pages were being fed"
1694.8,1697.9199999999998, next to the printer on that day.
1698.12,1699.84, And we still had to come down here and do it.
1699.84,1703.36," And actually, I thought, I was glad we got good feedback on the last podcast"
1703.36,1705.84, because I thought it was really bad because I was so tense.
1705.84,1707.44, I know Sean was really tense.
1707.44,1708.08, No.
1708.08,1711.6," But actually, that fueled the special hate issue of the podcast."
1711.6,1712.08, Yeah.
1712.08,1713.08, It was fuel.
1713.08,1716.08, All of my rage against Sierra games was basically because we were shipping.
1716.08,1718.56, I think I think that's what you guys.
1718.56,1719.08, But we.
1719.08,1719.6, Yeah.
1719.6,1721.08, That positive feedback.
1721.08,1724.08," I think helps us, like, I don't know if it doesn't actually help us get"
1724.08,1725.08, better.
1725.08,1726.08, I have no idea.
1726.08,1727.8," But like, it helps us get a little more excited about it, though."
1727.8,1728.8, Yeah.
1728.8,1731.6399999999999, The fact that we knew that we now know that there's actually people that
1731.6399999999999,1735.4399999999998," profess to enjoy listening to it or looking forward to the next one, whether or not"
1735.4399999999998,1736.8," not to let it go to your head, Sean."
1736.8,1737.8," No, I'm not saying that."
1737.8,1741.12," I said rather than the fact that we know it's good, I'm not saying anything like that."
1741.12,1742.12, It could be total ship.
1742.12,1744.84, But the fact there are people that profess that those were my words.
1744.84,1745.84, We were fine to say yes.
1745.84,1746.84, Okay.
1746.84,1747.84, Let's edit that area.
1747.84,1748.84, I hear you.
1748.84,1749.84, The underscore.
1749.84,1750.84," Like, I think that's cool."
1750.84,1753.6399999999999," I mean, I think it makes us more like excited to go do it when we know,"
1753.64,1756.48," like, this is just like one more of our duties of, yeah."
1756.48,1757.48, So we do it.
1757.48,1758.48, Yeah.
1758.48,1759.48," All we heard is, how do you guys suck?"
1759.48,1760.48, Why are you even bothering?
1760.48,1761.48, I don't think we would probably be.
1761.48,1763.68," And we got all these people, which just really makes me happy."
1763.68,1765.68," I wanted, this is a shout out to you."
1765.68,1769.88, I'm honest to give training to some of the other people on the Neil gaming age forums
1769.88,1773.3600000000001, to shout out because usually it's a big pool of sharks over there.
1773.3600000000001,1776.76," They've been really kind to us, really cool."
1776.76,1781.1200000000001," And all these other people that we get like on our forums and elsewhere just that say,"
1781.1200000000001,1783.3600000000001," like, they don't, they're not peace of gamers."
1783.36,1784.36, They don't play PC games.
1784.36,1787.28," But like, we're one of their podcasts that they listen to."
1787.28,1788.28, And that's pretty cool.
1788.28,1793.04, Because I can imagine it would be like the last thing I'd want to hear about if I wasn't a PC gamer.
1793.04,1794.04," It's like, do you want it?"
1794.04,1797.28," Like, let's, hey, there's a red, my real road podcast on."
1797.28,1799.28, I listen to it from the first day.
1799.28,1800.28, They got off.
1800.28,1801.28, Try the trick.
1801.28,1802.28, It took a lot of time.
1802.28,1803.28," No trains, man."
1803.28,1807.28," I tell you the best way to best way to flock of fake trees when you're used to one,"
1807.28,1808.28, 44 scale.
1808.28,1810.28, 140 something.
1810.28,1811.28, You know what?
1811.28,1812.28, You actually know a little bit more about that.
1812.68,1817.6399999999999," I think it's like, it's like a awkward country, but I don't treat."
1817.6399999999999,1819.52," Actually, I think it caught there."
1819.52,1820.52, It is not my all-train.
1820.52,1825.12," But I do, I've been in a collecting like diecast airplanes from World War II."
1825.12,1827.28," They have a cool, not proliferating on your desk there."
1827.28,1828.28, They have.
1828.28,1829.28, They usually go wild.
1829.28,1831.12, They might like nerd display case.
1831.12,1833.8," Everyone's like, that guy talks about nerds."
1833.8,1835.2, It's like an old man thing.
1835.2,1836.2, It's like dignified.
1836.2,1837.2," Like, it's going to grandpa."
1837.2,1838.54," He's got this cool, planes."
1838.54,1840.68," In the case, they'll beat your ass if you touch him."
1841.6000000000001,1842.6000000000001, So it's one of those things.
1842.6000000000001,1844.72," You get older, like, hey, I got something to say."
1844.72,1846.6000000000001," I waste my money on anything so I can just,"
1846.6000000000001,1848.04, all the go to saving on my K.
1848.04,1848.8400000000001, I need something to buy.
1848.8400000000001,1850.1200000000001, Don't you buy comics every week?
1850.1200000000001,1851.52, I'm totally as dare.
1851.52,1853.64, How many he's very select?
1853.64,1854.24, How many week?
1854.24,1855.0, Like one or two.
1855.0,1855.8400000000001, He buys like one or two.
1855.8400000000001,1856.64, How many?
1856.64,1858.24, Some weeks I go into my fuck this.
1858.24,1859.0, There's nothing around.
1859.0,1860.0, Yeah.
1860.0,1860.52, Sorry Jeff.
1860.52,1861.8400000000001, I didn't want any more F-bombs.
1861.8400000000001,1862.2," No, no."
1862.2,1864.04, When we needed one right there.
1864.04,1866.0, I think I dropped the F-bomber earlier.
1866.0,1867.3600000000001, I'm actually dropping the habit.
1867.3600000000001,1869.0, I'm actually officially going to start.
1869.0,1870.64," I was, I wasn't going to drop the habit."
1870.68,1871.64, I have fombs.
1871.64,1873.76," But sometimes when I see the comics there,"
1873.76,1876.96," that's what I'm, I'm okay with some profanity."
1876.96,1878.3600000000001, I just didn't want to stover do it.
1878.3600000000001,1879.3600000000001, Yeah.
1879.3600000000001,1882.0, It's all natural.
1882.0,1882.8400000000001," So wait, how much are you?"
1882.8400000000001,1883.8400000000001, What minor to ever?
1883.8400000000001,1886.0, How much are you spending on comics these days?
1886.0,1887.0," Okay, I'm weak."
1887.0,1890.1200000000001," Yeah, I'm probably the worst offender because I just soak up graphic novels"
1890.1200000000001,1891.1200000000001, and stuff.
1891.1200000000001,1892.48, I don't read as nearly as much a scooter you still probably.
1892.48,1893.48, Yeah.
1893.48,1896.0, I would say I spend probably 10 to 15 bucks a week.
1896.0,1897.2800000000002," All right, that's not that bad."
1897.2800000000002,1898.2800000000002, I bet it adds up.
1898.2800000000002,1899.2800000000002," You think, you know, over a month."
1899.2800000000002,1900.44, It does that up.
1900.44,1905.3600000000001," And but I was probably more of a $20, $25 at the point where I quit."
1905.3600000000001,1907.52," That's what you make any sense, though."
1907.52,1909.48, They're never that many good ones.
1909.48,1910.48, I know.
1910.48,1911.72, That's why I had to quit.
1911.72,1912.76, It was a week.
1912.76,1917.0, It's because I got completely sucked into it in every way.
1917.0,1919.88," Like, how would you suck the cross over the cross over the cross over the cross over the"
1919.88,1920.88, cross over the cross?
1920.88,1923.44," Because, yeah, exactly because I'd be reading Batman and then it'd be like,"
1923.44,1924.8, continued in the next weeks.
1924.8,1925.8, Robert.
1925.8,1926.8, But it's totally not a fucking fuck.
1926.8,1927.68, Now I got to read the video.
1927.68,1928.68, The nightfall.
1928.68,1929.68, It's the achievements.
1929.76,1930.68, It's the same thing.
1930.68,1932.68," It's just like, don't let it go."
1932.68,1935.3200000000002, Then they pull that all the freaking time in the comic world.
1935.3200000000002,1938.6000000000001, I would feel like I was missing a plot thread if I didn't go read Robin then.
1938.6000000000001,1941.72," You know, but you should like me and like do the plot sucks."
1941.72,1942.72, So I don't care.
1942.72,1944.44," Like the last one in hell, I could get more of it."
1944.44,1947.48," I couldn't help but you're not actually like, maybe you don't think it's going to be"
1947.48,1948.48, awesome.
1948.48,1949.48, And you have another thing about it.
1949.48,1955.04," So when you were spending 25 bucks a week or whatever it was, how long was it?"
1955.04,1957.96," Five, 10 years ago?"
1957.96,1958.96, That's 10.
1958.96,1959.96, It was more like five years ago.
1959.96,1962.52, Comic prices have gone up in that time.
1962.52,1964.96, So I'm going to imagine how much you drew how many bucks.
1964.96,1967.52, You can imagine how many stacks of comics you're walking out.
1967.52,1968.52," Yeah, think of that."
1968.52,1972.52," Like if even me, I had wait, it was ridiculous."
1972.52,1976.52," You know, it's like, I mean, in my era, like I was, when I started buying them, they were"
1976.52,1980.28, like 50 and I remember the jump on the one in 75 cents and that was pretty big for me.
1980.28,1982.08, You obviously remember a little earlier than that.
1982.08,1987.52," But they're like, hey, and now that the four bucks, I know like inflation all it's like,"
1987.52,1991.2," well, you could have bought a whole lot more for your 75 cents back then."
1991.2,1996.6," But like still, I'm just saying, there's only like, that's why there's probably like,"
1996.6,1998.44, and I don't like the superhero stuff so much.
1998.44,2000.96," Yeah, there's like four books a month that I'll read."
2000.96,2001.96, Why did that one as a kid?
2001.96,2002.96, And then I quit.
2002.96,2005.8799999999999," And then in the 80s, I came back and did the whole."
2005.8799999999999,2008.44," I started, I got back into it because of Watchman."
2008.44,2013.24," And then I would only buying like, oh, God, what was the very good stuff?"
2013.24,2017.48," The Peter baggy stuff, the, oh, hate, hate things like that."
2017.48,2019.04," And I was like, oh, I'm only reading this stuff."
2019.04,2020.1200000000001, Not that superhero stuff.
2020.1200000000001,2023.44," But then slowly, I got hardcore in this."
2023.44,2025.6," Slowly, I, I hear flash."
2025.6,2026.72, That's a good writer again.
2026.72,2027.72, Thank you.
2027.72,2031.88," He's guy gardener, guy gardener really died down the night over the green lantern."
2031.88,2034.52," Oh, man, that whole, this is all we got to do."
2034.52,2035.52, I'm on the bottom of that.
2035.52,2036.8," No, we're going to get off the comics track."
2036.8,2037.8, Yeah.
2037.8,2040.72," Actually, I actually watch, I pull it back."
2040.72,2041.72, Yeah.
2041.72,2046.0," So like this rule for comics, I use for games, but anything, any other obsession I have in life,"
2046.0,2047.0, I have a stack.
2047.0,2049.96," And if the stack gets above a certain, it's like a, it's like a watermark."
2049.96,2050.96, Yeah.
2050.96,2053.8," If that stack of comics is too high, I'm not buying anymore."
2053.8,2055.44, This is why I gave up that.
2055.44,2056.28, You throw them away.
2056.28,2060.56, That's why I quit was because the unread comics run my nightstand and the pile kept getting
2060.56,2061.56, higher and higher and higher.
2061.56,2064.76," And I was still buying new ones every week because I thought, I can't miss a week."
2064.76,2065.76, Yeah.
2065.76,2066.96, What if Robin sells out?
2066.96,2071.32," So the pile kept growing and then finally it's like, I'm done."
2071.32,2073.04, But I was doing the same thing with games too.
2073.04,2075.88," And like, like, because I have so many games to just try to sift through."
2075.88,2077.0," So after all, I'm just like, fuck it."
2077.0,2077.92, This one's just going.
2077.92,2078.92, Yeah.
2078.92,2082.1600000000003," And on that note, the GFW players are going to take a quick."
2082.1600000000003,2083.32, What was the question?
2083.32,2085.96," I was, there was a question."
2085.96,2089.6800000000003," I was trying to, he's a saint, not so, slightly into our break."
2089.6800000000003,2090.6800000000003, Really?
2090.6800000000003,2091.6800000000003, We have a break.
2091.6800000000003,2092.6800000000003, Yeah.
2092.6800000000003,2093.6800000000003, Let's do that.
2093.6800000000003,2094.6800000000003, Okay.
2094.6800000000003,2095.6800000000003, We'll have a break.
2095.6800000000003,2096.6800000000003, Okay.
2096.6800000000003,2097.6800000000003, We'll have a break.
2097.6800000000003,2099.6800000000003, We'll have a break today.
2099.6800000000003,2100.6800000000003, Okay.
2100.6800000000003,2101.6800000000003, We'll be back.
2101.6800000000003,2102.6800000000003, Attention.
2102.6800000000003,2103.6800000000003, Smart asses and dumb asses.
2103.6800000000003,2104.6800000000003, We'll rejoin you after the break.
2104.68,2105.68," Oh, hello."

2139.16,2140.16, Hi.
2140.16,2141.16, We're back.
2141.16,2142.16, Hello.
2142.16,2145.16, Do we have another question?
2145.16,2146.16, We do.
2146.16,2147.16, This is the long one.
2147.16,2150.16," If anyone wants to read it, that's cool, or I can read it."
2150.16,2151.16, You're doing a fine job.
2151.16,2153.16," You're a fraud, but it's good."
2153.16,2154.16, It comes to a good point.
2154.16,2155.16, Okay.
2155.16,2156.16, Okay.
2156.16,2159.16, I'm just going to see if I need to read the first paragraph.
2159.16,2162.16, You have some pregnant paws.
2162.16,2163.16," Oh, I'm on the editing there."
2163.16,2164.16, Yeah.
2164.16,2165.16," Actually, there was one that I'm just going to edit as I read it."
2165.16,2166.16, Go ahead.
2166.16,2169.16, Just filling up blank from the last reader question.
2169.16,2170.16, Yeah.
2170.16,2174.16," There are asking about, okay, we're talking about how the G, the gaming age forms were picking"
2174.16,2179.16," up on our stuff and a lot of people who were, or even into PC games or checking our podcast."
2179.16,2183.16," Another added bonus, which I personally find really rewarding is the people who are actually"
2183.16,2184.16," saying, you know what?"
2184.16,2187.16," I want to go out and check out the magazine now because of it, even though I don't play"
2187.16,2190.16," PC games and stuff like that, it's in some small way."
2190.16,2192.16," I feel like, you know, then I'm doing my job."
2192.16,2196.16," If we're getting people excited about PC games and they never even thought about it before,"
2196.16,2197.16, then we do something right.
2197.16,2198.16, Goddamn right.
2198.16,2199.16, That's a good man.
2199.16,2200.16, There you go.
2200.16,2201.16, Okay.
2201.16,2202.16, Sorry.
2202.16,2203.16, So you're a caught up.
2203.16,2204.16, That's how I ended up with the model railroad.
2204.16,2205.16, That's what I'm saying.
2205.16,2206.16, Okay.
2206.16,2207.16, So here we go.
2207.16,2209.16," Veter AJ guys, 7-11, says."
2209.16,2213.16, Now I know there are always people on the cutting edge who have the newest hardware at all
2213.16,2216.16, times to run games such as crisis and Unreal tournament 3.
2216.16,2220.16, But it seemed to me that the majority of users will not have a machine powerful enough to run
2220.16,2221.16, these games.
2221.16,2223.16, At some point they will and maybe they'll buy these games.
2223.16,2226.16, I'll be at from a bargain bin instead of getting it for $50 on day one.
2226.16,2230.16," Now to my point, is it really worth it to develop for the bleeding edge?"
2230.16,2234.16, It seems to me that companies that do are cutting out potential customers.
2234.16,2238.16, It is not unlike the way people feel when a console game launches doomed to die.
2238.16,2242.16," Some feel about, like some feel about resistance on PS3."
2242.16,2245.16, I look at what happened with both their requests to when World of Warcraft launched.
2245.16,2246.16, Nearly the same time.
2246.16,2251.16, And I wonder if part of what I've success is attributed to the fact that it can run almost any PC
2251.16,2252.16, from the last four years.
2252.16,2253.16, Okay.
2253.16,2254.16, Now here's where I thought it gets cool.
2254.16,2258.16," I understand that this pressure, especially now for PC to look better than consoles."
2258.16,2264.16," However, it seems at this time with advances such as DX10 and Vista, the PC console battle is being"
2264.16,2268.16," a naturally forced ahead, whereas in the past it seemed that PC would just naturally catch up."
2268.16,2271.16, So are we doing this spending another 600-year on new graphics cards?
2271.16,2274.16, Are you thinking after seeing possible diminished returns on such a big game?
2274.16,2278.16, I think it's a long-term return on such bleeding edge games that developers would go a bit more low-tech.
2278.16,2282.16," So long question, but I think it was the last paragraph that I thought was cool."
2282.16,2285.16," I mean, especially the whole, I mean, in relation to console stuff."
2285.16,2286.16, Yeah.
2286.16,2287.16, In relation to keeping up with console.
2287.16,2293.16," And then also about actually sort of shying away from AAA, like bleeding edge tech-based games."
2293.16,2296.16," And that, like I'll just offer an answer, is like now we're seeing,"
2296.16,2303.16, it's like every day now we see some new group or some new outlet where you're able to get games that don't care
2303.16,2306.16, or don't really need to be cutting edge in terms of technology.
2306.16,2307.16," Yeah, it's simply about."
2307.16,2312.16," So between the ubiquitous live arcade to stuff available on Steam to the game-cott guys,"
2312.16,2315.16," it just announced their initiative, you know?"
2315.16,2318.16," Well, I think there's, it's kind of funny that I think about it."
2318.16,2323.16," And this is in no way a Ra Ra Microsoft sort of comment, but there are, in a way,"
2323.16,2325.16, they're kind of working on both ends of the spectrum.
2325.16,2329.16," So you have obviously DX10 pushing the bleeding edge stuff, right?"
2329.16,2333.16," There's, you know, got to, got to get in the high-end process, there's the graphics cards in one."
2333.16,2338.16," And then you have a game studio expressed just having people, they're giving a free design tool."
2338.16,2341.16," So if anyone wants to make a game, they can do it for free."
2341.16,2347.16," And they have a decent, you know, programming tool to actually create a free game online right now."
2347.16,2351.16," So I mean, it's, I think they're trying to help foster the market in some way."
2351.16,2354.16," I mean, I totally want to see more people getting into games."
2355.16,2360.16," And me personally, I follow, I follow the indie games and freeware and share where a lot closer than I do."
2360.16,2362.16, Some of the big budget title is in the series.
2362.16,2366.16," And I think that's, honestly, that's what I think a lot of the future PC gaming can be is that"
2366.16,2372.16," everyone has a chance to make a good, a quick, dirty little game or whatever."
2372.16,2377.16," The other thing is just dead on is that few developers, two publishers have,"
2377.16,2385.16, are in a position to finance a PC-only AAA game with the multimillion-dollar development budget.
2385.16,2390.16," And like I say like, like, right about now, it's just a teach queue is one of the few ones doing it, you know,"
2390.16,2391.16, a lizard of course.
2391.16,2392.16," And lizard, yeah."
2392.16,2397.16," And because I mean, I would say valve is well, but I mean, obviously they're all talk about going"
2397.16,2398.16, multiply.
2398.16,2400.16, It hasn't really materialized outside of X-bar.
2400.16,2401.16," I mean, half like two for X-bar, one."
2401.16,2402.16, Right now.
2402.16,2404.16," But all their plans are, yeah."
2404.16,2407.16," I mean, definitely appreciate that they, that consoles they're lead."
2407.16,2410.16," I mean, that, that PC is they're leading platform."
2410.16,2411.16, Right.
2411.16,2416.16," But in terms of like, I said, THQ because company heroes, straight PC, Supreme Commander, straight PC, stalker."
2416.16,2417.16, That question question.
2417.16,2418.16, In tight question.
2418.16,2419.16, Yeah.
2419.16,2427.16," I mean, they're one of the few publishers that said, like, okay, we're going to recoup some of the cost for these with the European market because, you know, we definitely, and we just didn't story about that."
2427.16,2429.16," And I'd, you know, go back and pivot so much."
2429.16,2433.16," But I think it's really interesting that we can't, and guys like,"
2434.16,2449.16," who wrote that AJ, I think, would appreciate it because it says that, like, you're right, that it is diminishing returns to such an extent that you need world markets in order to support and make possible, you know, that level of investment, you know, PC only game."
2449.16,2451.16," And I think he was dead, right?"
2451.16,2456.16," I mean, maybe you all agree this in a, it's not really an arguable point, but the difference in the success between."
2456.16,2458.16," Wow, an EQ too."
2458.16,2461.16," I mean, obviously one game was way better than the other frankly."
2461.16,2469.16," I mean, I mean, I mean, because it wasn't just any PC from the last two years, it was the Mac as well."
2469.16,2470.16, Right.
2470.16,2474.16," And I forget who I was talking to about this recently, but I think, you know, Vanguard suffers from a lot of the same problems."
2474.16,2475.16," Well, right."
2475.16,2482.16," I mean, I've been reading a foreign posts about people, you know, even with great systems having to run Vanguard at the absolutely dumbest settings."
2482.16,2483.16, Yeah.
2483.16,2490.16," You know, and how how frustrating and discouraging with that be if you have a fairly recent PC, right, you know, I mostly play a world of work on my laptop, which is no."
2490.16,2492.16, Where near my right.
2492.16,2493.16, But the process fine.
2493.16,2499.16," And the cool thing, I think we're all kind of saying it is like the art styles really what makes it with sets in a partner."
2499.16,2500.16, Yeah.
2500.16,2507.16," And a totally proves art direction is like I can run it at like 800 by 600 or like at some ridiculous jacket up to 25, 60 by 1600."
2507.16,2509.16, It's going to look beautiful either way.
2509.16,2511.16," Yeah, I put that 8800 in my machine family."
2511.16,2515.16, The smaller one would go ahead and not make that joke again this week.
2515.16,2518.16," But I put the smaller one in the box and seriously, wow."
2518.16,2520.16, It looks like a different game to me now.
2520.16,2522.16, It's kind of blown me away.
2522.16,2524.16, That because I could jack it up so high.
2524.16,2530.16," I'm like, oh my god, there's like all these textures on the creatures that I never saw before because I was always playing on my laptop too."
2530.16,2535.16," So, but the fact it got it, you got to have something to do when you're fighting in that game."
2535.16,2537.16, But I had the textures.
2537.16,2539.16, Cool textures.
2539.16,2540.16, Cool textures.
2540.16,2541.16, Like one.
2541.16,2542.16, One.
2542.16,2543.16, It's all right.
2543.16,2544.16, Playing it.
2545.16,2547.16, Hit him with your hit him with your minus 17 gun Ryan.
2547.16,2549.16, Keep hitting him with that minus 17 gun.
2549.16,2551.16, This is like whatever it is.
2551.16,2553.16, You're the solider left.
2553.16,2554.16, We'll get you one day.
2554.16,2555.16," No, I'm the last one."
2555.16,2556.16, He's the holdout.
2556.16,2558.16," On that note, too."
2558.16,2563.16, The other thing is that like so saying that you have company like teach queue this doing just piece the only.
2563.16,2567.16, Everyone else is recouping their cost by spreading it across all the platforms.
2567.16,2572.16," I mean, more and more, it's like even people even, even not, you know, between PS3 and 360."
2572.16,2575.16, What is that exactly is differentiating the two?
2575.16,2578.16," You know, what happens when metal gears available on 360?"
2578.16,2583.16, What happens when a final fantasy is available on it grant that dot was available on it.
2583.16,2588.16," But for us, it's like most cases, it's actually all three."
2588.16,2590.16, Do you know who he never hear from anymore?
2590.16,2591.16, Activision.
2591.16,2595.16, Where the hell did they go on the PC actually go on?
2595.16,2597.16, They went to with with it stuff.
2597.16,2599.16, So you got to a quick horse.
2599.16,2600.16, You're right.
2600.16,2601.16, Sorry.
2601.16,2602.16, But he's not an idiot.
2602.16,2603.16, Right.
2603.16,2604.16, I'm a good cook.
2604.16,2605.16, But he's the one.
2605.16,2612.16," Here's part of what I was getting at the whole duty for example because because console hardware is established this bar where you can do these things and he's asking you know,"
2612.16,2617.16, PC traditionally catches up with its own pace and then like overlaps it.
2617.16,2619.16, But now it's happening sooner than it's happened before.
2619.16,2621.16, It's like PS3's just out.
2621.16,2622.16, You think that's right.
2622.16,2628.16, I think it's right according according to Des the A 800 slotters like the graphics capabilities of PS3.
2628.16,2629.16, Instrict like geek terms.
2629.16,2630.16, That's what I've absolutely.
2630.16,2635.16," I mean, well, I mean, strictly like the PS3 like in the dev unit that's used to show off."
2635.16,2636.16, Right.
2636.16,2640.16," It was basically like, you know, a sli system from like last year."
2640.16,2642.16, And we will not see.
2642.16,2648.16, And as soon as crisis comes out is when we will see where we've actually like overlap them to some extent.
2648.16,2652.16, But here's what here's the point I was making those at because of that because everyone's developing for all three of these.
2652.16,2657.16, What happens when we're sitting here with the A 800 and all this power that goes above and beyond there.
2657.16,2665.16, How many of these developers or publishers are going to pressure the developers to make PC versions that take advantage of it will be right back to where we were.
2665.16,2671.16, Before the current the now the current gen formerly the next gen the consoles came out when everything we're like dude looks like a PS2 game.
2671.16,2678.16," Like yeah, I know my 7900 can do a hell of a lot more than that. Why does you know whatever the game may be it was a King Kong was that way."
2678.16,2679.16, And look like the expo.
2679.16,2680.16, I think we're going to.
2680.16,2682.16, We'll be right back at that point.
2682.16,2687.16," How many people are going to be you know, aside from the cry text."
2687.16,2688.16," Well, how many aside from cry."
2688.16,2693.16, Who is who is going to be saying in a way it's almost the same argument you were making about the physics card.
2693.16,2701.16," Well, actually I think in this case Microsoft is heading into bets on the fact that everyone who buys a new PC is going to have this to install on their system."
2701.16,2703.16, And that means dex tends in there.
2703.16,2711.16, It's also going to mean that they can have a min a min spec machine a min spec hardware inside that same machine where they can play direct x 10 games out of the box.
2711.16,2720.16," I think basically the whole idea is it's not so much going to like oh my god, where all these hardcore gamers going to come from it's like anyone who buys a new computer is going to have this in there."
2720.16,2728.16, Because because just even to run vista like on its main interface it needs to write the x just for the main interface.
2728.16,2733.16, So like so it requires a certain level requires a certain level of graphics card and it creates a base level.
2733.16,2734.16, That's great.
2734.16,2737.16, So when you think the minimum RAM levels going to be now.
2737.16,2740.16, You know what I'm I'm I'm getting like for a gamer.
2740.16,2742.16, Two gigs.
2742.16,2744.16," Yeah, yeah, I'd say it's a fair."
2744.16,2752.16," But you know, I think it's like, you know, RAM is so cheap so you can get but the point is like to answer your question."
2752.16,2758.16," I mean, I see where you're trying to go with that like you know are they looking for an audience that isn't there."
2758.16,2762.16, I think I think what they're doing is is that the audience is just going to find itself hopefully.
2762.16,2767.16," But if it basically if like imagine you buy a computer you know, you might my mom buys a computer from Dell."
2768.16,2771.16, And you know John in and Johnny wants to play a game on that computer.
2771.16,2772.16, He was Johnny.
2772.16,2775.16, I'm inventing he's he's my son. He's going to call.
2775.16,2777.16," Anyway, so."
2778.16,2780.16," Yes, okay."
2780.16,2781.16, Johnny.
2781.16,2782.16, That was an awkward moment.
2782.16,2783.16," Yeah, never mind."
2783.16,2785.16, I'm going to turn on our old people.
2785.16,2787.16," Hey, since I let him finish."
2787.16,2788.16," Hey, I'm going to watch."
2788.16,2791.16, That's the time to tell people what was I is anyway.
2791.16,2792.16," No, anyway."
2792.16,2796.16, So forget you forget the whole point is you get you get a computer.
2797.16,2806.16," You know, you just want to play a game and you want to drop a game in and it'll work as opposed to like this whole thing in the past is a crap now is this is is this is king of it."
2806.16,2809.16," You know, am I going to be able to play it at all right."
2809.16,2815.16, It's not going to be like the same they'll get it hopefully it won't be that game in the past where you're like looking at the box and going a crap.
2815.16,2817.16, I need to go out and buy you the graphics card now or after buy.
2817.16,2819.16," No, I totally behind that."
2819.16,2824.16," I don't think that there's assuming there won't be an audience, but I'm just saying that I think that like for a great many publishers."
2824.16,2837.16, It's not going when they do their internal assessment they're going to say hey it's not really worth it to pump up a bunch of extra money because it looks great as it is like the whatever the the mark that we set for it to to meet on the PS3 and 360.
2837.16,2849.16," They're going to be like okay, that's cool we hit that mark you don't need to go above and beyond it when you do a PC version right you know that's what I'm worried about but that was a lot because that's been what's what drives PC at least to a market like me is you're like."
2849.16,2852.16," Dude, that looks so much better you can't compete with these great."
2852.16,2855.16, And the PC publishers are always going to do that right though.
2855.16,2868.16, I mean certain PC developers are always going to be the one to want to push it right so those games will be there for guys like that's what I hope but I'm saying they're far fewer like PC only at least on the cutting edge on the graphics cutting edge.
2868.16,2876.16," Yeah, now it seems like they're fewer because you know it and stuff they're obviously announced that their next big game is going to be multi platform right."
2876.16,2879.16, But you know that they'll push it on the PC though.
2879.16,2880.16, They lose guys.
2880.16,2881.16, It's hard.
2881.16,2898.16," So, Carmack has more or less said that like they're there for this along with the PC version because it's it's it's just easier to code for as opposed to like let's say you build a level for a 360 and you try running it and like oh crap the tech the frame rates are shit and you know the textures are not popping like they should or whatever."
2898.16,2900.16, And Ryan's actually asleep.
2900.16,2903.16," So,"
2903.16,2904.16," So, don't pull Brian okay."
2904.16,2909.16," So, wow anyone else want to better change the top one add in on that?"
2909.16,2912.16," No, I think it's great."
2912.16,2914.16, Pay attention.
2914.16,2915.16, Okay.
2915.16,2916.16, Go back to sleep right.
2916.16,2927.16," So, the last thing on our agenda is to come back this is now the third time we're talking about this but it was like approved super popular and whatever nerds though."
2927.16,2940.16, We had the real high school girl and she actually posted again to like a sure that she really was a high school girl and she was saying that she loved nerds but.
2940.16,2941.16, Hold her nerds.
2941.16,2942.16, I don't know.
2942.16,2943.16, I'm going there.
2943.16,2944.16," So, you make me feel."
2944.16,2946.16, You know that's better.
2946.16,2956.16," But also we were like, what is a nerd anyway, dude, you know, do what is she talking about the nerds even exist and so we got just page after page of people talking about you know hey here's my experience."
2956.16,2970.16," A lot of kids that just got out of high school, some that are still in high school and they felt a few of them were angry that they spent so much time that that clock and click away on the message board and tell us what nerds were that they still existed and we just kind of we ignore."
2970.16,2978.16," So, I could go on a die tribe about poop sockers and I mean, just panders and yeah, anime anime guys and all tacos and other people."
2978.16,2980.16, I would call me young master in surfmy tea.
2980.16,2982.16, I'm gonna be watching the rest of you.
2982.16,2983.16, You're gonna cook.
2983.16,2984.16, You're gonna cook.
2984.16,2986.16," Yeah, right here."
2986.16,2987.16, I'm gonna cook.
2987.16,2989.16, We're gonna be back in that territory.
2989.16,2992.16," So, um, start off."
2992.16,2998.16," We got another high school girl wanted to chime in and she says, this is a."
2998.16,2999.16, And they'll see.
2999.16,3007.16," She says, as a bona fide high school girl, I have to say, I'd love to know what Jenna smoking nerds aren't at all attractive."
3007.16,3010.1, She's through my perspective as
3010.1,3012.12," you say find out that, yes, I do love me some balker's gate."
3012.12,3014.16, Video games and all of Nerdy and to find me.
3014.16,3015.16, Hi.
3015.16,3016.16, Hi.
3016.16,3019.16, How do you feel about Final Fantasy.
3019.16,3020.16, I want to join my guild.
3020.16,3021.16, Hi.
3021.16,3023.16," Why don't you talk to me, I think she's using the."
3023.16,3024.8399999999997, I said not that I'm like just counting all the loft my shit.
3024.8399999999997,3026.8799999999997," Like, I randomly laughs into it any."
3026.8799999999997,3027.92, I'm all that.
3027.92,3029.12, So if you look at you social course.
3029.12,3030.62, Earth and can't be.
3030.62,3031.14, It's all cap.
3031.14,3033.3999999999996," It's all like spelled and lead speak, so she's a shk."
3033.3999999999996,3035.52, I happen to have a life outside video games.
3035.52,3038.8, And even play wow mainly because of this type of social interaction.
3038.8,3040.4, High school is pretty much the same.
3040.4,3044.16," We make fun of D&D years, people that walk around with strategy guides, but at the same"
3044.16,3046.7599999999998, time we all play video games to some extent.
3046.7599999999998,3050.6," Nearly everyone plays the Sims, wants or is addicted to their boyfriend or brother's"
3050.6,3054.56," Wii, and I've got plenty of oozing eyes over my DS Lite, and I wasn't even playing"
3054.56,3055.56, in 10 dogs.
3055.56,3058.12," And yes, yes, yes, of course there are outliers."
3058.12,3062.92," I can think of a few anime watching Stargate Loving, PS3 Licking Guys out there who are"
3062.92,3064.44, really great to hang out with.
3064.44,3067.84," And that's because video games don't define them, and they know what video games don't"
3067.84,3068.84, define.
3068.84,3070.36, And they know that video games don't define me.
3070.36,3073.28, He point nerd still suck.
3073.28,3074.28, That's a great lead.
3074.28,3075.48, Helpful to get a life.
3075.48,3076.48, You'll be hotter.
3076.48,3077.48, Wow.
3077.48,3078.48, And they're great.
3078.48,3080.08, And there's your message at point.
3080.08,3081.08, They're talking points.
3081.08,3082.08, Yeah.
3082.08,3083.48, So let's just keep going.
3083.48,3087.76, Nito Jenkins who's kind of like he writes for us has done illustration for us.
3087.76,3088.76, So he's on the inside.
3088.76,3091.36, He's the ubiquitous friend I always talk about.
3091.36,3093.36, Me and my friend were making some videos online.
3093.36,3095.4, He had a friend or playing mouth.
3095.4,3097.4, So my mom said that devil.
3097.4,3098.4, He's actually a real friend.
3098.4,3099.4, He's actually a real deal.
3099.4,3104.8, So he says that he went to an inner city high school where clicks were pretty loose.
3104.8,3106.6, And most people generally got along.
3106.6,3110.36, There were a few champions that really set themselves apart from the pack in nerdry.
3110.36,3113.6," Eventually, the simple equation was created, identify the nerd threat."
3113.6,3116.8, And it's nerd equals orange camouflage pants.
3116.8,3118.0, But this was done with images.
3118.0,3120.28, So I'm just right now.
3120.32,3121.28, They were so big.
3121.28,3123.48, It's blue camouflage pants to or pink or whatever.
3123.48,3124.48, I've never flushed pants.
3124.48,3127.2000000000003, Plus cowboy boots plus old spice.
3127.2000000000003,3129.48, And now I've never seen that.
3129.48,3131.6800000000003, But it's been a soda though.
3131.6800000000003,3136.48, So maybe it's like defining a way to say that again.
3136.48,3141.0400000000004, Camifos pants plus orange camouflage pants cowboy boots and old spice.
3141.0400000000004,3142.0400000000004, Isn't there?
3142.0400000000004,3143.0400000000004, That sounds more like pimped.
3143.0400000000004,3144.0400000000004, I know.
3144.0400000000004,3145.0400000000004, It's interesting.
3145.0400000000004,3146.0400000000004, Look at this.
3146.0400000000004,3149.0400000000004, You know like the silk dragon ball shirt.
3149.04,3151.96, I know that's how we rolled and Sherman Oaks.
3151.96,3154.7599999999998, Let's give him a moment and visualize the silk dragon ball shirt.
3154.7599999999998,3155.7599999999998, I got it.
3155.7599999999998,3156.7599999999998, I'm going to wrap it around.
3156.7599999999998,3157.7599999999998, Okay.
3157.7599999999998,3158.7599999999998, Or the silk spider man shirt.
3158.7599999999998,3160.36," Yeah, this spider man's pretty sick too."
3160.36,3161.36, Okay.
3161.36,3164.04, And then like the peep stash always goes along.
3164.04,3165.04," Oh, like the cheesy."
3165.04,3167.04, Like with little cheetos kind of hanging off.
3167.04,3168.04, Okay.
3168.04,3170.64, So going on.
3170.64,3177.12," Message board member, Baron Colamity says that nerd still exists mainstream players play"
3177.12,3180.3199999999997," games, but nerds get into the tech behind the game."
3180.3199999999997,3183.72, And then so Darren and I are just exposed talking about actual others bullshitting my way
3183.72,3184.72," through it, but we're talking about."
3184.72,3185.72, Yeah.
3185.72,3187.12, And we are all to find ourselves as gamers too.
3187.12,3192.12, So we're screwed on on in Celio's account and Maricolanimities.
3192.12,3193.12," Yeah, basically out of it."
3193.12,3196.8399999999997," So he says, here she is so and more comfortable developing relationships with things than"
3196.8399999999997,3197.8399999999997, with people.
3197.8399999999997,3200.24," Before computers, it was AV before that."
3200.24,3201.24, It was books before that.
3201.24,3202.24, It was writing.
3202.24,3204.88, So he's going back some medieval nerds on the show.
3204.88,3205.88, Like scribes.
3205.88,3206.88, I can't know.
3206.88,3207.88, Can I talk to you?
3207.88,3210.88, Socrates nerd old school nerds had tauntures.
3210.88,3213.32, I've often thought that.
3213.32,3215.56," What if I was back in like, you know, Roman times."
3215.56,3217.32, I wouldn't have been like a glad eater.
3217.32,3218.32, Yeah.
3218.32,3221.84, I would have been like a dork back then doing whatever dorks did back in the 80-12.
3221.84,3225.28, If you were reporting on the orgies or the vomitorian or something like that.
3225.28,3226.28, Something like that.
3226.28,3227.28, Reviewing orgies.
3227.28,3229.28, So before this gets out.
3229.28,3230.28, Very clever.
3230.28,3231.28, He just hit you.
3231.28,3235.84, Nerds generally are the first to interact with things before.
3235.88,3239.44," The general population does, but they develop relationships with those things."
3239.44,3240.44, Where is the mainstream?
3240.44,3241.44, Never does.
3241.44,3242.44, Okay.
3242.44,3243.44, Thanks for ruining intimacy.
3243.44,3244.44, I'm sorry.
3244.44,3245.44, Sorry.
3245.44,3250.2000000000003," Guys, if I looked in Roman times, I would have been hanging out with Gulligula in his"
3250.2000000000003,3251.2000000000003, career.
3251.2000000000003,3257.6000000000004," And then, you know, they say that they threw the gladiators all the women."
3257.6000000000004,3260.84, Maybe I'd find a way to get the women without being a gladiator.
3260.84,3262.84," I'm sorry, Sean."
3262.84,3263.84, Sorry Sean.
3263.84,3264.84, You hurt my feelings.
3265.84,3267.04, I just watched Rome last night.
3267.04,3268.04, It was in my head.
3268.04,3269.04, Okay.
3269.04,3270.04, I hear I get it.
3270.04,3272.04, That's another version.
3272.04,3273.04, Yeah.
3273.04,3274.04, Okay.
3274.04,3276.04," So, because we're talking about nerds."
3276.04,3277.04, Yeah.
3277.04,3278.04, That's not a good one.
3278.04,3279.04," Actually, you know what?"
3279.04,3280.6400000000003," It's not that far outtrack, actually."
3280.6400000000003,3283.44, Eq addicted fool writes in the safe.
3283.44,3286.2400000000002, I used to think I was the lowest on the nerd chain.
3286.2400000000002,3287.6400000000003, I built my own computers.
3287.6400000000003,3290.6400000000003, Now play ever quest for hours upon hours every day.
3290.6400000000003,3292.04, I selling the brownie paper towel again.
3292.04,3294.04, I love my Japanese RPGs.
3294.04,3296.04, I put a lot of time in money and a magic together.
3296.04,3301.04, I would be the maleiest nerd I ever would.
3301.04,3302.04, It really is.
3302.04,3305.04," But when people would point out my flaws, I would not run off and cry."
3305.04,3307.04, I can do a little girl.
3307.04,3309.04, I was saying like unto a little girl.
3309.04,3310.04, I'm adding.
3310.04,3311.04, Are you adding that section?
3311.04,3312.04, I'm adding that section up here a little bit.
3312.04,3313.04," No, that was good."
3313.04,3316.04, And I would just add and add to that list.
3316.04,3318.04," But then one day, I met a kid."
3318.04,3321.04, This kid showed me just how cool I actually was.
3321.04,3323.04, He was a larp or a live action role player.
3323.04,3324.04, If you will.
3324.04,3327.04, And I happen to watch a session of this so called larping.
3327.04,3328.04, Bear ball.
3328.04,3329.04, Bear ball.
3329.04,3330.04, My name is Bob.
3330.04,3331.04, Maggie Go Boos for me.
3331.04,3335.04, But I realized how cool I was because I wasn't running around screaming.
3335.04,3336.04, Bear ball.
3336.04,3337.04, Bear ball.
3337.04,3338.04, I need both.
3338.04,3339.04, Exactly.
3339.04,3340.04, I'm just kidding.
3340.04,3341.04, On top of it.
3341.04,3343.04, This kid played New York.
3343.04,3345.04, And he only listened to Japanese music.
3345.04,3347.04, And the only thing he would talk about was anime.
3347.04,3349.04, So I called him an idiot one day.
3349.04,3352.04, And I caught him saying speed racer wasn't anime.
3352.04,3353.04, He was a little bit like a kid.
3353.04,3357.04, He was a kid even more three belts to school so he could look like a squirrel from Final Fantasy.
3357.04,3358.04, Yeah.
3358.04,3363.04," For Halloween, this piece of shit dressed up like a red mage."
3363.04,3364.04, Back to my point.
3364.04,3365.04, This kid was ridiculed.
3365.04,3367.04, But this was all he was doing.
3367.04,3369.04, He let himself take the abuse.
3369.04,3372.04, And I'm not saying this kid should go on a kill in spree or even start picking fights.
3372.04,3373.04, And I never did that.
3373.04,3374.04, And I'm tall as hell.
3374.04,3376.04, And I weigh a 120 pounds.
3376.04,3378.04, But no way am I going to fight someone.
3378.04,3380.04, And this kid would just break down and cry.
3381.04,3382.04, Threatening go cut himself.
3382.04,3384.04, It's starting to be like the sling blade guy.
3384.04,3385.04," Well, okay."
3385.04,3387.04, So I like the titers.
3387.04,3390.04, Girls do recognize the value and the geek nerd.
3390.04,3392.04, But you have to show them what you can offer them.
3392.04,3393.04, So when else can't.
3393.04,3395.04, You can't sit back and think about them.
3395.04,3399.04, Get off your stuff and prove to them that your life is shit without you.
3399.04,3403.04, Don't mind that you can't have the chick who's easier than a blonde on prom night.
3403.04,3406.04, Camp outside a Walmart next console launch and bag of chick there.
3406.04,3409.04, Because I'm willing to put my money down on the fact that she's just as bad as you are.
3409.04,3412.04, That's what I did.
3412.04,3414.04, So there we go.
3414.04,3415.04, Wow.
3415.04,3416.04, Well done.
3416.04,3418.04, That's a hard living nerd.
3418.04,3419.04, That is a hard nerd.
3419.04,3421.04, I do like the point of why is a whiskey next to him.
3421.04,3424.04, I do like the point about the kid only listening to Japanese music though.
3424.04,3427.04, Because that is some truly sad shit.
3427.04,3428.04, I got a joke.
3428.04,3430.04, Like not that Japanese music is bad.
3430.04,3431.04, Okay.
3431.04,3432.04, Because it's probably for one.
3432.04,3433.04, Okay.
3433.04,3434.04, There's two great two distinctions to make one.
3434.04,3437.04," The Japanese music he's listening to is probably stuff that like any, you know,"
3437.04,3439.04," and form Japanese person would be like, oh god."
3439.04,3441.04, Like if there's one thing we're exporting.
3441.04,3442.04, Why does it have to be that?
3442.04,3444.04," You know, like in the same way that you were higher."
3444.04,3447.04," Like why is the world, why do we export Britney Spears to the world or Baywatch?"
3447.04,3450.04," And there's some kids somewhere saying that like, you know, Britney Spears number one."
3450.04,3452.04," We're like hell no, come on."
3452.04,3454.04, So it's like that kind of music.
3454.04,3456.04, But also like to the exclusion of everything else.
3456.04,3458.04," When you're like, you know what?"
3458.04,3461.04, The Beatles are no good or whoever.
3461.04,3462.04," You know, like no."
3462.04,3466.04," I don't like, they've been for me."
3466.04,3468.04, I only like the soundtrack to you.
3468.04,3469.04, You.
3469.04,3470.04, You.
3470.04,3471.04, That's right.
3471.04,3472.04, And there is.
3472.04,3473.04, And that's yeah.
3473.04,3474.04, It's a bit extreme.
3474.04,3476.04," And then I mean, you see, you see, the YouTube video to do."
3476.04,3477.04, They call him O'Talking.
3477.04,3479.04," He goes to like, uh, to finally makes it to Tokyo."
3479.04,3480.04, Yeah.
3480.04,3482.04, He somehow hooks up some locals and he goes to the karaoke thing.
3482.04,3485.04, And he's singing in like the most mangled Japanese ever.
3485.04,3487.04," The lyrics to like, the start of cartoons."
3487.04,3488.04, Mm-hmm.
3488.04,3490.04," I, we got like two or three of those guys on the one up staff."
3490.04,3492.04," I think, you know, because we all have a share."
3492.04,3494.04, We have our shared iTunes music thing.
3494.04,3495.04," So you can see the people's, yes."
3495.04,3496.04, Yes.
3496.04,3500.04," You go into some of the libraries and every one of their CDs is like, you know,"
3500.04,3502.04," soundtrack to Final Fantasy, too."
3502.04,3503.04, Right.
3503.04,3504.04, But that's a music.
3504.04,3505.04, That's true.
3505.04,3506.04, Do I need to let you Nirvana?
3506.04,3507.04, What is this?
3507.04,3510.04," And you start scroll down and you're like, okay, this is like, he had to do some like,"
3510.04,3512.04, one up show production or something.
3512.04,3514.04," Like, I'm going to scroll down and hit the real shit."
3514.04,3515.04, Which scroll down.
3515.04,3516.04, And it's worse and worse.
3516.04,3517.04," It's like, during gray."
3517.04,3518.04," Like, can you heard of that?"
3518.04,3519.04, I probably miss pronouncing it.
3519.04,3520.04, But fuck you.
3520.04,3521.04, I don't care.
3521.04,3522.04, I don't want to pronounce it.
3522.04,3523.04, Right.
3523.04,3525.04," It's like, but it's like, he's, again, nothing."
3525.04,3526.04, It gets the cross dress.
3526.04,3531.04," But it's like, it's cross dressing like cosplay and Japanese fools."
3531.04,3532.04, I don't know.
3532.04,3535.04," It's like, all those things together don't sit well with me."
3535.04,3536.04, Yeah.
3536.04,3537.04, Right.
3537.04,3539.04," I'm not trying to hate on it, but I'm just trying to hate on it."
3539.04,3540.04, Why?
3540.04,3542.04, Why are you just listening to the burning crusade sound track last week?
3542.04,3543.04, Shit.
3543.04,3544.04, Oh.
3544.04,3545.04, Oh.
3545.04,3547.04, It's closed.
3547.04,3548.04, I was.
3548.04,3550.04, I had the collectors.
3550.04,3551.04, I sold out.
3551.04,3552.04, I sold out.
3552.04,3553.04, I sold out.
3553.04,3554.04, I sold out.
3554.04,3555.04, I sold out.
3555.04,3558.04, I just pulled it out once and I played it one time.
3558.04,3560.04," These asshole, you know, back when I was at the original,"
3560.04,3562.04," you know, the Bob Dylan concert."
3562.04,3565.04," These asshole, and I just, you know, these assholes are playing"
3565.04,3566.04, Final Fantasy soundtrack.
3566.04,3568.04, You got a your own place.
3568.04,3569.04, Yeah.
3569.04,3574.04, When I was adding to it to the point where you only listen to the wall music.
3574.04,3575.04, That was like the exception.
3575.04,3578.04, I'm not at the Bob Dylan concert screaming.
3578.04,3579.04," Do you struggle, sir?"
3580.04,3583.04," Oh, no, you were trying to make a change about that."
3583.04,3588.04, That's a good idea.
3588.04,3589.04, Maybe next time I will.
3589.04,3590.04," Oh, my god."
3590.04,3591.04," Oh, that's a good idea."
3591.04,3593.04," Actually, no, that's part of his tour."
3593.04,3594.04," Yeah, yeah."
3594.04,3595.04," Yeah, I don't know."
3595.04,3598.04, Dylan's got to have at least like a dual monitor set up with.
3598.04,3601.04, With this trailer and a bit of a sauce car.
3601.04,3602.04," Just a little, a little, a little."
3602.04,3607.04," A little, just ding to 70."
3607.04,3610.04, I got a tail.
3610.04,3613.04," Well, I'm sorry."
3613.04,3614.04, We're either wrapping it.
3614.04,3615.04," Okay, wait, let's go on."
3615.04,3617.04," We got, yeah, we got two more."
3617.04,3618.04, We can read one more.
3618.04,3619.04, Right.
3619.04,3624.04," Another thing that the original poster, who the high school who started all this set,"
3624.04,3627.04," Oh, and why don't other high school girls realize how amazing nerds are."
3627.04,3632.04," So the one of community manager, Super Gen, Super Jennifer responded."
3632.04,3635.04, Better read this normal or show come down kick.
3635.04,3636.04," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3636.04,3641.04," What perpetually irks me is when questions like these are posed, and no one really means other high school girls."
3641.04,3643.04, They don't mean the average girls are the nerd girls.
3643.04,3647.04," They mean the cheerleaders or whoever, the whole beauty and the geek thing."
3647.04,3650.04, There are other high school girls who realize how amazing nerds are.
3650.04,3652.04, Because they're nerds too.
3652.04,3655.04," When I was at nerdling in junior high playing computer games and reading sci-fi all day,"
3655.04,3660.04," I was a cutely aware that not only did I have a, did I not have a shot with the hot eight or seven greater."
3660.04,3663.04, I didn't even have a shot with my own nerd kin.
3663.04,3664.04, Just mentioning.
3665.04,3667.04," That's another awesome letter. So yeah,"
3667.04,3671.04, That's yeah. So you nerds out there nerd high school kids are that are waiting.
3671.04,3673.04," Yeah, nerd that's her waiting. Just, you know,"
3673.04,3676.04, St. Your sights don't lower. Don't wait for city Hawkins.
3676.04,3678.04, So based right love the nerd you're with.
3678.04,3679.04, Uh huh.
3679.04,3680.04, Go on.
3680.04,3681.04, I've paid it.
3681.04,3682.04, Operator your own level.
3682.04,3685.04," I mean, should I thank you there, Crossbeast doesn't match."
3685.04,3686.04, The last one.
3686.04,3688.04, We get the other up and up here.
3688.04,3689.04, Okay. Okay. We'll wrap it up.
3689.04,3690.04, I'll say the letter.
3690.04,3691.04, We don't read this from a dude in the UK.
3691.04,3699.04," It seems we got a lot of UK listeners and his whole thing was that their nerds and wild players are also drug dealers and drug addicts,"
3699.04,3700.04, but we don't want to read that.
3700.04,3701.04, We don't.
3701.04,3702.04, Also they have better accents anyway.
3702.04,3703.04, Yeah.
3703.04,3704.04, They probably don't sound as nerd.
3704.04,3707.04, So even the air can get better chance to get any of the nerds here.
3707.04,3709.04, Did you get the new new G.L. Pack?
3709.04,3711.04, Maybe that's the last ganky.
3711.04,3714.04, You're just going to go out.
3714.04,3715.04, Go out.
3715.04,3716.04, I got nothing.
3716.04,3717.04, I got nothing.
3717.04,3718.04, I got nothing.
3719.04,3720.04, I'm so good for moving.
3720.04,3721.04, Maybe more cockney.
3721.04,3722.04, Hello.
3722.04,3723.04, A little more cockney.

3733.04,3734.04, We are.
3734.04,3735.04, Screw those right.
3735.04,3736.04, All right.
3736.04,3738.04," Well, we're done."
3738.04,3739.04, We're done.
3739.04,3740.04, Okay.
3740.04,3743.04, I'll see you in my two three weeks.

3745.04,3746.04, I'll have to get married.
3747.04,3750.04, And now I have to find new and creative ways to come up with excuses for playing games at odd hours.
3750.04,3751.04, No.
3751.04,3752.04, No.
3752.04,3753.04, No.
3753.04,3754.04, Nothing changes.
3754.04,3755.04, Don't play.
3755.04,3757.04," If anyone, if any one of us sees you logged in on."
3757.04,3759.04, Wow or Xbox live during your honeymoon.

3763.04,3764.04," But more importantly, right here."
3764.04,3765.04, We're gonna write your wife.
3765.04,3767.04, Do you know that that happened to Scooter at a official place.
3767.04,3768.04, Asia magazine.
3768.04,3769.04, He was first honeymoon.
3769.04,3771.04, And then he showed up on on.

3772.04,3773.04, There he's on the moon.
3773.04,3774.04, Yeah.
3774.04,3775.04, People just get the hell off.
3775.04,3777.04, I think you're doing it.
3777.04,3780.04," Larry, it's got a young bride waiting for you."
3780.04,3781.04, Loser.
3781.04,3782.04, That's that.
3782.04,3785.04, I will not be bringing any notebook with me on the trip.
3785.04,3786.04, No.
3786.04,3790.04, So we ended our sorted tail of nerds with a sorted the ultimate sorted tail of nerds.
3790.04,3791.04, Right.
3791.04,3792.04, Don't go up to be Scooter.
