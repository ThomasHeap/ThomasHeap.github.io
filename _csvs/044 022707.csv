31.04,35.92, This is the one-up radio network and now GFW radio.
35.92,40.72, Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast.
40.72,44.36," I don't, again, I don't know what the date is, so I'm not even going to bother trying."
44.36,45.36, Don't know.
45.36,46.36, 20th.
46.36,51.480000000000004," It's the end of February podcast, 2007 and I'm here with the again-reduced staff of GFW."
51.480000000000004,54.28, Darren who glides on still on his honeymoon.
54.28,56.28, How much time did we give the guy?
56.52,59.120000000000005, What kind of ship am I running here?
59.120000000000005,61.32, It's like the second week out.
61.32,63.32," Gladstone, get back here."
63.32,65.52, We got a magazine to do.
65.52,68.52, But I'm here with the other three guys who are as follows.
68.52,69.52, Brian Scott.
69.52,70.52, Sean Elliott.
70.52,71.52, Sean Maloy.
71.52,72.52000000000001, Hello fellows.
72.52000000000001,73.52000000000001, Hello.
73.52000000000001,75.2," At the tone of the time, I'll be."
75.2,81.04," So I want to start right off with Mr. Sean Elliott had a fairly epic, well, I wasn't"
81.04,86.2," an epic weekend, but the reverberations carried out throughout the weekend of your"
86.2,87.2, appearance.
87.2,90.2, Your legendary appearance on One Up Yours.
90.2,95.84," And I'm sure that probably some listeners are following you over here from that show,"
95.84,98.88, to him to hate because it was to hate you some more.
98.88,103.32000000000001," Because it was so epic, so I thought maybe we could just talk about that a little bit."
103.32000000000001,110.80000000000001," If you didn't listen to it, Sean was a special guest on One Up Yours, which is the network's"
110.80000000000001,116.16," kind of flagship podcast there that has Luke Smith, garnetly."
117.11999999999999,120.39999999999999," Normally John Davidson who was out this week, Shane Betthus."
120.39999999999999,125.28," And Sean was on and they had a, what does name?"
125.28,126.28, I'm sorry.
126.28,127.44, Mitch Phelos name Mitch.
127.44,128.44, Yeah.
128.44,131.84, From Phasa to talk about Shadowrun.
131.84,135.07999999999998, And you guys did a little bit of raking over the calls.
135.07999999999998,136.07999999999998, Got a little while.
136.07999999999998,137.07999999999998, Yeah.
137.07999999999998,141.07999999999998, I thought you're going to bring this up and excuse me of a cheat on the cast here of
141.07999999999998,142.07999999999998," infidelity, you know."
142.07999999999998,143.07999999999998," Well, there is that."
143.07999999999998,146.12," Well, I was waiting to bring up the damn Ryan in his wretched."
146.12,147.12, I'm sure not.
147.12,149.76, And you guys in your legendary thread.
149.76,151.16, We're all cheating on the podcast.
151.16,152.16, I did it.
152.16,153.16, Don't like each other.
153.16,154.76, I learned it by watching you.
154.76,156.16, Why are we all cheating?
156.16,158.16, It's it's come to that.
158.16,159.16, You're infidelity.
159.16,161.20000000000002, So we're spreading or spreading around.
161.20000000000002,162.96," But I mean, that's that's part of the fun though."
162.96,164.64000000000001," I mean, we'll get we're all on one floor up here."
164.64000000000001,167.76, We're all basically in the same boat and working on different angles.
167.76,172.56," I mean, we take stories and they have life in different parts of the game group and stuff"
172.56,174.16, everyone's used to hearing with.
174.2,178.28," You know what suck last week though, was when we had one Sean Malay and I went straight"
178.28,180.07999999999998, from the wow cast into this one.
180.07999999999998,181.07999999999998," Yeah, that's got to grow."
181.07999999999998,182.07999999999998, I saw kind of spent.
182.07999999999998,186.07999999999998, It's got to be weird too because that's one thing I noticed over there is that like
186.07999999999998,187.72," the, what is it?"
187.72,189.07999999999998, What's the word I'm looking for?
189.07999999999998,192.16," They're not the dynamic, but the chemistry between us."
192.16,193.16, Yeah.
193.16,194.16, It's just different.
194.16,195.16, You have to get used to it.
195.16,197.16, I was kind of quiet at first when I was on there.
197.16,199.72," Instead of being the loud and loud nerd voice, whatever."
199.72,204.12, Usually I'm here just because getting to know how they handle it.
204.12,206.12, It's a little thing that's getting used to their humor and stuff like that.
206.12,207.8, It's easy and comfortable here.
207.8,210.44," Like us, I have the time to get forget that we're actually recording anything."
210.44,211.44, I know.
211.44,214.12," And I think I did eventually during that point, but it is different."
214.12,216.48000000000002, I remember all the time that you farted on the podcast.
216.48000000000002,217.48000000000002, That was about the podcast.
217.48000000000002,219.48000000000002," That's how, yeah, that's how far back I forgot that."
219.48000000000002,221.48000000000002, He actually had a headset.
221.48000000000002,224.08," Sean, you're not even buying yourself."
224.08,225.08," No, that was your self."
225.08,227.08," I mean, it was definitely fun being on there."
227.08,229.16, I got pretty wild.
229.16,231.68," And I do, I mean, I don't know what all, there's to say about it."
231.68,236.92000000000002," And you know, Mitch and Shadow Run quick, I'm a quick rundown again on his game is,"
236.92000000000002,243.48000000000002," is it's a cross platform FPS in the shadow, you know, using characters and themes from"
243.48000000000002,246.24, the Shadow Run universe from the RPGs.
246.24,250.88, Cross platform meaning you can play on Xbox 360 and on your PC.
250.88,252.88," Yeah, excuse me, but it's going to suck on PC."
252.88,253.88, Isn't it?
253.88,258.28000000000003," Right, it's so, nobody, I mean, yeah, it's like I had the whole thing."
258.28,263.32," So I just had, I played it, you know, that day prior before we met for the podcast."
263.32,265.76," Yeah, I thought it was fun, but I ended up for a few reasons."
265.76,270.55999999999995," You know, as Mitch pointed out, one, they're having issues with changing the presets for the"
270.55999999999995,271.55999999999995, controller.
271.55999999999995,274.32," I mean, for the, for the mouse and keyboard, you couldn't choose mouse, looks speed."
274.32,276.15999999999997, You couldn't alter it and stuff.
276.15999999999997,277.15999999999997, And that's all very basic.
277.15999999999997,278.15999999999997, It's really weird.
278.15999999999997,281.79999999999995," Like I think, for as a PC, because controllers are the same everywhere."
281.79999999999995,285.28," You know what PC is always different when I go to, and I plant anyone else's rig."
285.28,289.23999999999995," It's like, even the height of the chair can throw me off or like the height of the keyboard."
289.23999999999995,293.64," I mean, when you're really down to like competing, you know, FPS, it sounds like the biggest"
293.64,298.23999999999995," like whiny bitch like I didn't have my magic do rag tucked in my back pocket or whatever,"
298.23999999999995,301.2," you know, whatever kind of kind of shit like that, but it really throws you off."
301.2,304.64," And, but especially changing your, your looks speed."
304.64,308.15999999999997, And everyone's got theirs and it's either really fast or somewhere slow or people make
308.15999999999997,310.23999999999995," fun on them, but it like works for them."
310.23999999999995,311.59999999999997, And so I wasn't able to change that.
311.6,315.84000000000003," And I ended up, you know, just having a hard time of it on there."
315.84000000000003,319.16," And, but I ended up playing on the controller a lot too."
319.16,320.16, And I thought that was fine.
320.16,324.40000000000003," And it was like, hey, this is a great game, but it just seemed to me as if like top to bottom,"
324.40000000000003,329.52000000000004," it's been designed for preamily for console play, just bit by, you know, and I don't want"
329.52000000000004,330.6, to go over it all over again.
330.6,331.6, Right.
331.6,334.52000000000004," But based on, you know, the movement speed, and all the things that differentiate games on the,"
334.52000000000004,336.64000000000004," you know, first person shooters on the two platforms."
336.64000000000004,337.64000000000004, Uh-huh.
337.64000000000004,341.56," And it's not just the interface, but it's the way that the game is put together to reflect"
341.6,343.2, that interface.
343.2,345.2," You know, I thought you had some good questions."
345.2,349.32," It just, you know, it just kind of got a little bit at a hand."
349.32,349.88, Right.
349.88,355.64, The other thing that I was concerned about too is just like depth of options for people
355.64,358.72, that are hosting servers on the PC side and hosting games.
358.72,360.76," I mean, you want to be able to do all these things, you know, plug-ins."
360.76,365.44," The fun stuff about, you know, valves at PSS, for example, and annoying is that you could"
365.44,366.6, just do anything to them.
366.6,368.44," I mean, you can tweak any variable."
369.36,373.8," And it's, and it works in a much different way than for consoles where you have like a list"
373.8,376.36," of options and you say, okay, it will turn Max kills to 28."
376.36,381.08," I mean, you could set the gravity based on, like, you know, any variable, you know,"
381.08,382.84, you want between one and a hundred or something.
382.84,386.72," And, you know, you put it on, and I say annoying because you start putting all the sound"
386.72,387.72, files.
387.72,392.12," And it's like, now, what point can you join like any source-based game and not have to load,"
392.12,396.8," like the entire, an entire season's worth a Simpsons voice is like, but it sounds"
396.8,401.04," like a clip before you can just go in and play a map that you've had for five years,"
401.04,402.04, you know.
402.04,405.2," Anyway, that was a fun game."
405.2,407.76, There's got a lot of potential to it.
407.76,411.84000000000003," And I hope, maybe I'm sure we'll be hearing from Mitch and from Press again about Shadow"
411.84000000000003,412.84000000000003, Run.
412.84000000000003,414.04, And he was a great guy.
414.04,418.12," I think he was like, for the kind of, bring this back to the fact that we got a magazine"
418.12,419.12, here.
419.12,422.84000000000003, He's an excellent candidate for the sorts of interviews that we do in print.
422.88,429.84," You know, what we've labeled the GFW interview is the CGW interview prior to that, where it's"
429.84,435.52," not about presenting, you know, your latest game, but about sort of assessing and reading"
435.52,437.12, your career in gaming.
437.12,439.67999999999995," You know, what have you done for games, you know, what have games done for you?"
439.67999999999995,441.0," It's a current sounds corny, actually."
441.0,446.0," But just looking back on your career and seeing, you know, what are the highlights in this"
446.0,449.91999999999996, map and how you define what's a game by this person that this person's involved in.
450.0,454.48," Well, we got to do is get like some real loser on who said like, no good hits whatsoever."
454.48,457.16," Yeah, just like, break them over the calls for three pails."
457.16,459.84000000000003, What were you thinking?
459.84000000000003,461.16, We did versions of that.
461.16,462.16, It's so weird.
462.16,467.08000000000004," Does the whole, what is it that great game never made stories that we never really got any"
467.08000000000004,468.08000000000004, feedback on them?
468.08000000000004,472.68, And I have this like thinking feeling that there's a whole lot of people out there that
472.68,476.36," read them and think there's like actually a game called, what was the last one?"
476.44,479.44," Venture, venture quest in the score of the scorpion slayer."
479.44,480.44," So real quick, right?"
480.44,484.2," Real quick, that is like they're just, we taken make up these games that didn't exist"
484.2,488.84000000000003, and developers that didn't develop them and they just epitomize like the worst of any
488.84000000000003,491.24, given or just like the most generic of any given genre.
491.24,498.04, So action RPG just amounted to slaying scorpions and adventure quest was just complete nonsense.
498.04,499.48, That's entire kids.
499.48,501.92," But so yeah, where are we going with this?"
501.92,502.92, We want that we want to do.
503.0,506.68," We're going to say that at little, a little pimped, which we never do on this podcast."
506.68,507.36, Right.
507.36,510.16, We never actually talk about the fact that we actually make a magazine.
510.16,513.36, This is since we feel like we probably have new listeners here.
513.36,514.96, We want to remind them.
514.96,518.64," This could be our play, like this is our play striped for their project."
518.64,521.04," Yeah, we got Ryan Scott on the phones here."
521.04,523.84," He's on the, he's over there refreshing."
523.84,527.48," He's got, uh, dig.com up podcast games and hobbies list."
527.48,529.24, He's refreshing the page.
529.24,532.4," See that we got, uh, however, I mean, 16 digs now."
532.92,537.0, For the entire body of a standing by and the refresh button.
537.0,539.5999999999999, So you get a lovely t-shirt.
539.5999999999999,541.0," Yeah, it's been coffee mug."
541.0,543.0," It's been working out well for, so I think, attention."
543.0,545.04," I'm like, like, we've kind of like, you walk."
545.04,546.04, You're going to get nothing.
546.04,546.8399999999999, You'll get our magazine.
546.8399999999999,548.0, You get a magazine.
548.0,548.8399999999999," Oh yeah, you get them."
548.8399999999999,549.8399999999999," Yeah, whatever."
549.8399999999999,550.68, Yeah.
550.68,551.68, You're subscribing.
551.68,552.68, You get a magazine.
552.68,557.92," Show us your show us your lovis and you appreciate having, uh, having us on the air with these wonderful stories."
557.92,561.64," And, uh, subscribe to our magazine."
561.64,562.64, And Ryan can go home.
562.64,563.64, Right.
563.64,564.64, Yeah.
564.64,567.0," But you're hearing about guilds, or you're like hearing about world of work, or"
567.0,568.64, I feel like hearing about crisis.
568.64,569.64, Wow.
569.64,570.64, The source of a lot of PBS.
570.64,571.64, That's great.
571.64,572.64, Well done.
572.64,577.84," If you want to keep hearing these things that you love, right, throwing your $20, $30,"
577.84,579.64," whatever, every little bit helps."
579.64,581.64, Just don't send us below $20.
581.64,583.64, But there's always a cut off line.
583.64,584.64, I'm always amazed.
584.64,585.64, These starts from in bother.
585.64,586.64, Send in a hundred bucks.
586.64,587.64, 100 bucks.
587.64,588.64, Like 10.
588.64,590.64," No, we don't want that."
590.64,593.64, Send us whatever we can find you a good subscription for like $19.99.
593.64,597.64," You know what we got to do is make up some fake ones, so to up the Annie."
597.64,601.64," We just got $1,000 in from Mitch and Redwood City."
601.64,603.64, Thank you.
603.64,606.64," Uh, Jared Thorbond just subscribed, uh, 68 times."
606.64,607.64, 60.
607.64,609.64, Subscriptions go to his house.
609.64,614.64," We should paper paper the pens of his, uh, 800 birds."
614.64,617.64, Really like that alone in the dark preview.
617.64,618.64, Okay.
618.64,619.64, Anyway.
620.64,624.64," But there is no, I think it's going to bring it up because we've been getting a lot more attention to the podcast."
624.64,630.64," And I think being on one up is great, uh, for us too, because hopefully people even know we exist now."
630.64,633.64," So we're that, you know, we've been doing this magazine for a long time."
633.64,635.64, The rest of them say like long time.
635.64,636.64, A long time.
636.64,640.64," Some in some cases like mine a decade and yet this podcast,"
640.64,642.64, at somehow like attracts more attention.
642.64,644.64, You know what I think is the thing?
644.64,645.64, I think print is dead.
645.64,647.64," That's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the."
647.64,648.64, It's a serious.
648.64,650.64, You said because you're here for that.
650.64,652.64," You know, as Jeff saying it."
652.64,653.64," No, no."
653.64,656.64, You want that to be that Kotaku headline next week.
656.64,657.64, Right.
657.64,659.64, And for one of those editors as print is dead.
659.64,661.64, But I think I know where you're coming from.
661.64,662.64, I hope you're joking.
662.64,663.64, I'm kidding.
663.64,664.64, Right.
664.64,667.64," But, but where you're coming from is like, yeah, you've been doing this for for how many years."
667.64,668.64, 10 years.
668.64,669.64, And I get it.
669.64,675.64, And have you ever felt you got as much attention from any given story or even a whole issue as you have from a
675.64,676.64, story.
676.64,684.64," And so that's what I'm saying is like the mail and our mailbox at work, the threads online are bigger than they are for what we do in a regular job."
684.64,685.64, Right.
685.64,686.64, Right.
686.64,690.64, I mean sometimes individual articles or comms or whatever would generate a decent amount of mail.
690.64,692.64, But this is kind of overwhelming.
692.64,693.64, Right.
693.64,698.64," And it's like, it makes me sad too because you, I mean, we come in here and watch stuff to top of your head."
698.64,699.64, Brand where we ran belongs.
699.64,700.64, Right.
700.64,701.64, Right.
701.64,702.64, Send that in email.
703.64,704.64, 10.
704.64,705.64, Email.
705.64,706.64, He 50 for a 40.
706.64,708.64," You know, like I spent all week in, you know,"
708.64,710.64, Saggingizing over a cover story.
710.64,711.64, Yeah.
711.64,712.64, Little announcement there.
712.64,716.64," And, you know, and on that, it's like, is anyone going to even do, you know, is it going to,"
716.64,717.64, Yeah.
717.64,718.64, And then we'll get noticed.
718.64,726.64," When the most first thing for me is in print when we, like, because, you know, we all try here at the staff to come up with articles that we're not going to read in the other magazines."
726.64,728.64, The same old shit that we see all the time.
729.64,731.64, We do the show and we'll accept the bread and butter stuff.
731.64,732.64, We all do it.
732.64,734.64, But we'll come up with something really cool.
734.64,738.64," We'll work very hard on it, you know, whoever's writing the story is like,"
738.64,741.64," busing the grass for, you know, days of late at night."
741.64,742.64, We'll get it in.
742.64,743.64, We'll edit it.
743.64,744.64, We'll be super proud of it.
744.64,746.64, And then we won't get one email about it.
746.64,747.64, Right.
747.64,748.64," And it's like, God damn."
748.64,750.64," And the only email comes in will be like,"
750.64,752.64," How come the screenshot in the,"
752.64,753.64, Yeah.
753.64,756.64," And the shadow around previous shows, the gun on the left side."
756.64,758.64, When the gun's supposed to be on the right.
758.64,760.64," Like, that's only, you know, we get it."
760.64,762.64," Like, God, why do we bother?"
762.64,766.64, You had an extra period after the word horse ride or spelling corrections.
766.64,767.64, Yeah.
767.64,771.64," And we do like, I mean, it is, I think it is worth pimping, especially the people who who listen"
771.64,775.64, and don't read the magazine because you will see people complaining about.
775.64,779.64," We want, you know, we want a level of depth and engagement and stories,"
779.64,782.64," and, you know, and writing about games that we're not finding."
782.64,784.64," But every month, you know, which is what I think we've,"
784.64,787.64," we've been specializing in, you know, in the section that I've been handling."
787.64,791.64," I mean, I've made a point of chasing those sorts of stories for, for like over a year,"
791.64,792.64," you know, almost two years now."
792.64,795.64," And say, for example, an issue that's just coming out."
795.64,800.64," There's the, the love hate story and I promise this will be the last time we do this."
800.64,801.64, We're not going to come on next time.
801.64,802.64," Yeah, yeah."
802.64,806.64," God, I don't feel bad about doing it right now because I think looking around online,"
806.64,808.64," there's so many people that really don't realize,"
808.64,809.64, we'll be putting the magazine every month.
809.64,811.64, And this was our pledge drive episode.
811.64,812.64, And this is our pledge drive.
812.64,813.64, So we're allowed.
813.64,817.64," Ryan, so standing by, by the hate, the cool thing about the cool thing about this,"
817.64,820.64," you know, and all these sent sent off,"
820.64,823.64," dealers out to as many people in the industry that make games and are related to the,"
823.64,826.64," you know, the game making is possible and said,"
826.64,832.64, you have as many words as you would like to talk about some aspect or aspects of
832.64,836.64," PC gaming that you love and some that you hate, you know."
836.64,839.64," But the condition is, we, it's very simple, but the condition is,"
840.64,844.64," you know, we hate working deadlines and crunches, you know,"
844.64,847.64," where we're just giving a million hours away, the whole EA wife type stuff."
847.64,850.64," Or, no, I love the fact that I get to make games for a living."
850.64,852.64," I mean, those were the conditions."
852.64,853.64, Think about it.
853.64,854.64, We're to not do that.
854.64,855.64, Right.
855.64,857.64," So that you know, that I said, I would actually say, like,"
857.64,861.64," you know, imagine this is you and your peers at the bars after the game developers"
861.64,864.64," concert, concert, concert."
864.64,868.64," I know a lot about games, guys about game development."
868.64,871.64," And so what are you, what's keeping you awake tonight?"
871.64,873.64, What are you guys talking about amongst yourselves?
873.64,876.64, What are the big things that are on your mind?
876.64,878.64, And we've got a lot of excellent feedback.
878.64,880.64," I mean, Warren Spectre is just huge."
880.64,882.64, It's always huge for us.
882.64,886.64," Completely like a level that guy is level of, you know,"
886.64,889.64, level of commitment to talking about his craft and what he does.
889.64,891.64," And so he just gave us a good, he is great."
891.64,894.64," Good deal, and say he's a quote to machine."
894.64,895.64, Yeah.
895.64,897.64," And several people, see, we're absolutely, you know,"
897.64,899.64, fantastic way that there is one for that story.
899.64,903.64," But we do that kind of thing, you know, every issue is when it's you after the other,"
903.64,904.64, the big story we did.
904.64,907.64, I'll pimple on other story from this current issue that you actually
907.64,911.64," shepherd it through too, which was the confessions of a hitman story."
911.64,913.64, Sean put together a story.
913.64,915.64," Wait, you didn't write it."
915.64,916.64, Actually did.
916.64,917.64," Yeah, right. Oh, I'm sorry."
917.64,918.64, It was really good.
918.64,919.64, Right.
919.64,920.64, It was really good.
920.64,921.64, Right.
921.64,922.64, Who wrote whatever I decided.
922.64,924.64, I'm like Colonel Blake and Mash.
924.64,926.64," Yeah, he was your two-week pass."
926.64,934.64," So yeah, no Sean put together a story where he, he interviewed a guy who apparently"
934.64,941.64, hired some self-ad to do online harassment of other players in online games.
941.64,943.64," Shooters, shooters, right."
943.64,944.64, Which is always interesting.
944.64,949.64, But his tactics were really funny because it wasn't just like being on the opposite team
949.64,951.64, and targeting that person.
951.64,953.64, It was actually being on the same team.
953.64,954.64, Right.
954.64,955.64, And messing with them.
955.64,956.64, Making life hell.
956.64,957.64, Making life hell.
957.64,962.64," So, but I thought that was really interesting, you know, culture of gaming story."
962.64,963.64," Yeah, it's cool."
963.64,967.64," I mean, the whole reason I did that in the first place is because it's not stuff that's handed to us."
967.64,971.64," You know, I mean, part of my motto, I've been repeating around here a lot is like if if"
971.64,974.64," if PR gives you a story, it's not a story, it's PR."
974.64,978.64," And yeah, so, you know, instead of company X comes to it and you know,"
978.64,979.64, no knock on them.
979.64,982.64," I mean, they make what we do possible by giving it screens and giving it to access to, you know,"
982.64,984.64, the great developers and stuff.
984.64,988.64," But if it's a case of they come to you this month and they're like hey, we want this story."
988.64,990.64, We want this many pages for it.
990.64,991.64," I mean, some will always a preview."
991.64,995.64, At times they will say they'll package it in the form of a story or something.
995.64,996.64, Right.
996.64,997.64," It's just, I mean, the start job."
997.64,999.64, We got to chase these on our own.
999.64,1000.64, Right.
1000.64,1003.64," Stories don't sadly, they do end up writing themselves most of the time."
1003.64,1007.64," Actually, I wanted to throw in a plug for because I forgot to do it last week and"
1007.64,1010.64," it's late, but it's probably a better late than ever."
1010.64,1015.64," On the gamers with jobs podcast, it's gamerswithjobs.com."
1015.64,1018.64, They had interviewed me for the length of the podcast.
1018.64,1024.6399999999999," We talked at great length about the preview process because they were really interested in finding out,"
1024.6399999999999,1030.6399999999999," you know, how it is we deal with that kind of crap, you know, with the with the PR machine and"
1030.6399999999999,1037.6399999999999," whether we respond to it, you know, whether we actually do our journalistic job of, you know,"
1037.64,1041.64, of coming up with our own stories or basically let the PR companies write them for.
1041.64,1042.64, That's cool.
1042.64,1043.64," So, yeah."
1043.64,1044.64, So there's a lot on there.
1044.64,1046.64, And I'm a semi-plug at a week ago and I forgot.
1046.64,1052.64," I really just like internal like I've had this pet story that one of our contributing editors,"
1052.64,1056.64," Matt Packham, who's, I mean, you're talking about, you know, you appreciate some of the stories I put together."
1056.64,1061.64," I like this guy's a god sent, you know, every month he just does something just amazing for us."
1061.64,1065.64, And we have this pet story where we do want to look into that exact subject.
1065.64,1073.64," But the hard part for us and this is kind of like first time you've heard of it is pitching you on it is that if we want to talk about,"
1073.64,1075.64," it's kind of up its own asshole, right?"
1075.64,1076.64," I mean, that taught it."
1076.64,1080.64," If you're going to talk about how it's a game magazine talking about how game magazines get written,"
1080.64,1084.64," it's like, how do you take and package that in a way that anyone gives a shit, you know,"
1084.64,1091.64," but if you put it in the light of, okay, you know, everyone who is an enthusiast in this, you know,"
1091.64,1099.64, in this medium gets their information from these outlets and then all these outlets are essentially
1099.64,1101.64, funneling that information and operating in the same way.
1101.64,1105.64," Then I think that's one way that I'm looking at that we can, you know, that we have an angle on it,"
1105.64,1107.64, that we have some bite into it.
1107.64,1111.64," And the others that, you know, just how, how do developers themselves understand it?"
1111.64,1114.64," I mean, do they, I mean, clearly they're going to appreciate it because PR does,"
1114.64,1120.64," and it's not a hostile type story that we're imagining where PR is just this big sort of,"
1120.64,1125.64," sort of barrier between the writers and the people that make the games,"
1125.64,1131.64," but how they see and how peer-prevalued themselves see what they do and how ultimately it's beneficial for a lot of people,"
1131.64,1134.64, but at the same time where that breaks down and where things can go wrong.
1134.64,1139.64," I mean, we do know a lot of cases, you know, we're not in name names or something,"
1139.64,1143.64, but where PR people will get bonuses based on the review scores.
1143.64,1144.64, It games get.
1144.64,1145.64, I think it's pretty prevalent.
1145.64,1147.64, And we brought that up before.
1147.64,1148.64," Yeah, it's pretty prevalent."
1148.64,1152.64," And, but it's disturbing to us because the assumption there is that"
1152.64,1155.64," successful PR is creating, right?"
1155.64,1161.64," Or if not creating is is heavily influencing reviews scores, right?"
1161.64,1166.64," And I mean, if you just stop and think about that, you like, it's a, yeah, it's unreal."
1166.64,1170.64," Right, and it can sumer, I mean, and a consumer you'd think would be interested in that,"
1170.64,1174.64," because ultimately if they're looking at review indexes to help to make buying purchase, you know,"
1174.64,1175.64, buying decisions.
1175.64,1181.64," And, and the assumption is that these, that these review indexes are largely like,"
1181.64,1187.64, created based on how well public relations persons performing.
1187.64,1189.64," Then I think that looks starts to become interesting in that line, but we'll see,"
1189.64,1190.64, who knows?
1190.64,1191.64," Yeah, it's kind of thinking out loud."
1191.64,1196.64, There's a little window into the future and how things work.
1196.64,1197.64, Yeah.
1197.64,1199.64," And it's weird that the game companies, I mean,"
1199.64,1203.64," like, my experience is like the actual people like making the games,"
1203.64,1207.64," the developers and the creative people are like, you know,"
1207.64,1210.64," actually many of them, the audience for our magazine, right?"
1210.64,1215.64," Many cases, if we're the gamers, they read the magazine and they understand what we're doing."
1215.64,1219.64," It's like the people above them, kind of like the people above us,"
1219.64,1226.64," who, not that I don't love all my bosses and employers, and I'm so grateful to be employed here still."
1226.64,1229.64," But they've told you because you're a specialist in you, right?"
1229.64,1239.64," You've got, you know, the experiences that you know exactly what's going on and what we do or understand it or understand any kind of difference between any kind of church and state division."
1239.64,1242.64," You know, yeah, it's the business version of the art, right?"
1242.64,1244.64, I'm going to come down to it.
1244.64,1252.64," Right. You know, I mean, what I'm what I'm beating around the bushes is that I think a lot of game companies on one side of the business don't"
1252.64,1257.64, really see our magazine as anything else than a catalog for them to sell their games.
1257.64,1265.64," Exactly. Oh, not only that, and just flat out a space for a much more cost-effective version of advertising,"
1265.64,1270.64," right? There are two forms of advertisements in our book, and this is in their mind."
1270.64,1275.64," Yeah. Obviously, this is not the case. And you know, this might job to make sure this isn't the actual case,"
1275.64,1280.64," but I think their mind, they have those that they speak to our marketing department and pay for a page and they put,"
1280.64,1287.64," then they have the superior one in that it costs them only as much as it costs to have a press junk at or fly someone,"
1287.64,1292.64," some place to talk to one about, you know, and to put the screens together."
1292.64,1297.64," And then that one is even better version because not only because of the cost effectiveness,"
1297.64,1301.64, but it has the editorial stamp on it. So people are going to let their guard down.
1301.64,1305.64," Uh-huh. In a way, is that they're not going to when they look at something that's marked as an advertising."
1305.64,1310.64," Uh-huh. And this is across the board, you know, I mean, like what you do is you hold an event and you, and not only that,"
1310.64,1315.64," you're not only getting a GFW ad, so to speak, in their mind again."
1315.64,1321.64," So I'm not accusing anyone. I'm talking, this isn't the mind of this, this of someone who just doesn't really care about the content of the edit."
1321.64,1327.64, And so much is what they're achieving. And then they get a billion. They get it across like 60 online sites and 20 magazines.
1327.64,1333.64," And, and if you would have, if you put the do the math, what it would cost to get that many pages of straight advertising."
1333.64,1338.64, It's probably a lot cheaper to host a big extravagant thing with the shrimp cost.
1338.64,1343.64," I heard people say like, well, we don't have a real big marketing budget on this one, so we're doing a lot of PR."
1343.64,1349.64," Right. Because if they can get a magazine cover, what is the magazine cover other than like a big ad for them?"
1349.64,1355.64," Right. Unless we were to put a cover line that was, you know, whatever, quake ten worst game ever, you know,"
1355.64,1359.64, unless we put a cover line like that. And that's what we're not going to do.
1359.64,1363.64," In some cases, it's like hard to knock like because it is mutually beneficial. Like our next cover story."
1363.64,1369.64," Yeah, it's just, I said it. I alluded to earlier, is something that all of our readers are definitely interested in."
1369.64,1375.64, They want to know about it. And even to the extent that they want to see what it looks like. They want to know everything that's in it.
1375.64,1379.64," And we too, I think it's great. It's on a cover because we like what it is."
1379.64,1383.64, Yeah. This is a case of it having a pedigree and having precedent.
1383.64,1388.64," Uh-huh. And we're familiar with the precedent. We absolutely love it. So we're like, hey, this is cool."
1388.64,1391.64," And it doesn't necessarily have to, I mean, they're not, we're still writing our story."
1391.64,1395.64," We're asking our own questions. I'm saying, like, hey, this is, this is an aspect of the story that's interesting to me."
1395.64,1403.64," Perhaps someone else is not going to necessarily be any better or worse, but they're going to be, they're going to be more interested in other aspects of this game."
1403.64,1406.64," Or, or the circumstances surrounding its creation."
1406.64,1416.64," It's a win-win. So, but yeah, it's the win-win situation. I mean, yeah, we're just basically explaining the awful that here in the sense that this is why I do this, this is why I do this, this press has always been around."
1416.64,1424.64," Right. But you know, this, this bullshit we're going with with this one company who I will, I can't mention their name, but don't raise your eyebrows to me."
1424.64,1426.64, It's cool. You don't mean we don't mention names.
1427.64,1436.64," But we have the situation where we have this one very big game company who is saying on their, you know, marketing sales side that they don't believe in,"
1436.64,1450.64," and games for Windows, either the, either the Microsoft initiative or this magazine. And so therefore, you know, maybe they think they don't really need to advertise in our magazine, because they think it's kind of a stupid idea."
1450.64,1458.64," So, we're going to be able to use to, have, like, advertise more in CGW. However, they're okay with getting the editorial coverage on the PR side."
1458.64,1464.64," There's still very much hitting us hard for what should be, though. I mean, that is that means that church and state are separate."
1464.64,1468.64," That means because the PR people aren't there, they're, the people that buy ads."
1468.64,1478.64," Right. So that means, I mean, technically, that's fine. You know, that's how it should be. But it is, it is there, though, to say it's just little, it's kind of weird to me because it's sort of like, I mean,"
1478.64,1484.64," right, there should be that church and state thing, but it's to me. It's also saying like, we don't believe in you unless we can get the free articles."
1484.64,1486.64, Right. Right.
1486.64,1490.64," Yeah. In the cynical side of, yeah. Yeah. That's there."
1490.64,1496.64," I mean, if you really don't believe in it, then, you know, go away and take your PR people with you if, if our magazine is on."
1496.64,1502.64," But at the same time, you don't want to, you don't want to like, blend church and state where we have, where we're talking to the people that sell ads for us,"
1502.64,1508.64," which, which we want absolutely nothing to do with as editors because we don't want to get to the point where someone can say, hey,"
1508.64,1512.64," well, they don't cover such and such product because that company doesn't advertise with."
1512.64,1515.64," Right. So it just, I don't really give a shit. Right."
1515.64,1519.64," And this company is our, this company who's not an academic. That's our solution."
1519.64,1524.64," We, we need Taco Bell and Nike and these other ads where there is no church in state."
1524.64,1529.64," Well, yeah. You know, right. I mean, we, ideally, in a, in a perfect world, yeah, we would have like,"
1529.64,1534.64," and you know how many problems that would fix because it would also fix a problem of of reader perception of,"
1534.64,1538.64," well, they can't ever say anything mean because of their advertisers, right?"
1538.64,1542.64," If our advertisers were Coke and Freedos, yeah, who cares? And whatever it would make it different."
1542.64,1545.64, It wouldn't make a definite game in the gestion when I was playing or craft.
1545.64,1547.64," Page of Lad ice, occasionally."
1547.64,1554.64," Right. And you know, we don't give a shit either way. I mean, I don't really care at all who advertisers."
1554.64,1557.64," I mean, I just want, I want more ads, so then we have more energy."
1557.64,1560.64, Right. That's the hard part for us. Yeah. Yeah.
1560.64,1563.64, So I wonder if they're planning to people understand that.
1563.64,1566.64," I was about to say that is a good time to bring that up because a lot of people will say,"
1566.64,1570.64," Hey, there's a lot of ads in there that means less editorial pages, but it's actually quite the opposite."
1570.64,1573.64, Why don't you guys print less ads and then put more in for articles?
1573.64,1577.64," Yeah, totally or so. That way, not only on this magazine, but any magazine and existence."
1577.64,1580.64, The ad pages pay. I think are reading a kid that.
1580.64,1585.64, Do you think? I think it's like the go the readers like at EGM because that's a constant issue there.
1585.64,1590.64," Like if you look on their forums and then their letters box, like month and month out, he's so small."
1590.64,1593.64, And it's always like that. I think I think that.
1593.64,1596.64, Okay. That's right. We do. I'm thankful when we do.
1596.64,1599.64," We just said that we don't get letters and stuff, but we do."
1599.64,1602.64," But we get them. And I think we've got to, yeah."
1602.64,1605.64, We've got a pretty cool set of readers. I love you guys.
1605.64,1610.64," Because, I don't know, did you see my older, more mature, like less, I don't know."
1610.64,1616.64," That's just the, I mean, we do get the craziness. And actually, yeah, later on, I'm going to read something for, okay."
1616.64,1620.64," For Ryan, the here is the web comes back in the form of actually one of them that maybe doesn't get it."
1620.64,1621.64, It doesn't have it all there.
1621.64,1622.64, Yeah.
1622.64,1623.64, Yeah.
1623.64,1628.64," Maybe we could just move into moving that now unless you guys want to break down the, we're okay with that."
1628.64,1631.64," We sort of, we, we free associated like three different ways there."
1631.64,1633.64, We did and ended up where we were.
1633.64,1637.64," And I still didn't say what that next couple of stories, which I promised was, was it cool?"
1637.64,1639.64, I'm going to say what it is.
1639.64,1640.64," No, I don't know."
1640.64,1641.64, Okay.
1641.64,1642.64, Now you're back and down.
1642.64,1644.64, We go to lunch today on my case.
1644.64,1648.64," I'm going to come out with this thing and you're like, well, that sounds good."
1648.64,1650.64," Now you're like, I had Godhead."
1650.64,1653.64," If you have any reservations about it, it's going to get us in."
1653.64,1654.64, I don't know.
1654.64,1655.64," Well, forget it."
1655.64,1658.64," I'm not trying to be like, coy with people listening."
1658.64,1659.64," Oh, we're not telling you."
1659.64,1660.64," I know, that's silly."
1660.64,1664.64," No, I just want to say it because I mean, people, like, this is a game that a lot of people like."
1664.64,1665.64, I like.
1665.64,1666.64, I don't want to be a mess.
1666.64,1668.64," I'm asking that then to go, we got six weeks."
1668.64,1669.64, We could catch them.
1669.64,1670.64, Let's get that story.
1670.64,1671.64," But, you know, I'm not."
1671.64,1672.64," No, that's not going to happen."
1672.64,1675.64," But, if, okay, if you're sweating it, then we will do it."
1675.64,1676.64, We just did a big tease.
1676.64,1678.64, Maybe at the end of the episode hanging there.
1678.64,1681.64," And we might, we might come out with."
1681.64,1682.64, We might be something.
1682.64,1683.64, Yeah.
1683.64,1684.64, Yeah.
1684.64,1685.64," So, okay, just jumping in now."
1685.64,1686.64, I'm not going to overdo here.
1686.64,1687.64, Is it the web this week?
1687.64,1688.64, But we got one.
1688.64,1689.64, One hero.
1689.64,1690.64, I've been on hero.
1690.64,1691.64, Got a hero.
1691.64,1692.64, And this hero.
1692.64,1694.64, What I explain with the heroes of the web are for people who did not listen.
1695.64,1696.64," Oh, yeah, good idea."
1696.64,1697.64, That makes sense.
1697.64,1703.64," Here is the web are, as the title says, heroes of the web."
1703.64,1706.64," And having said that, Sean."
1706.64,1707.64, The champions.
1707.64,1708.64, I know I are a writer.
1708.64,1711.64, Champions of this interactive world.
1711.64,1720.64," So, they basically are people that we want acknowledge for outstanding contributions to the World Wide Web in the form of, you know, message board posts and stuff."
1720.64,1721.64," Or, letters."
1721.64,1723.64," Sometimes it's, sometimes they'll go to our letters box."
1723.64,1726.64," But these guys, because the thing is life is hard."
1726.64,1727.64, We all work hard.
1727.64,1728.64, We play hard.
1728.64,1732.64," And at the end of the day, when we're sitting in our computers lonely at night in our room."
1732.64,1735.64, And we come across these messages and they make us laugh.
1735.64,1736.64, They make us laugh.
1736.64,1737.64," So, that makes some heroes."
1737.64,1739.64, For going above in the other column.
1739.64,1740.64, Yeah.
1740.64,1743.64," I mean, most people can get on the, you know, they post and you're like, okay, that was cool."
1743.64,1744.64, And you think about it.
1744.64,1746.64," But there's some, once in a while, every once in a while."
1746.64,1749.64, And they remind you why you pay for the broadband every month.
1750.64,1755.64," They sure is how late the extra, the mini episodes of Bouss start collecting lost or whatever."
1755.64,1756.64, It's these heroes.
1756.64,1757.64, Yeah.
1757.64,1758.64, They saved no metropolis.
1758.64,1762.64," As on the side, those extra scene things online."
1762.64,1763.64, They can go away.
1763.64,1764.64, Yeah.
1764.64,1765.64, But lost.
1765.64,1766.64, There's a way.
1766.64,1768.64," So, it's like, it's like cutting them in floor."
1768.64,1770.64, But you guys do that with your magazine every month.
1770.64,1772.64, I buy the magazine because I want to read a magazine.
1772.64,1775.64," And there's all these little blurves that say, go online to read more about it."
1775.64,1776.64, True.
1776.64,1778.64, That's just the trash we couldn't print.
1778.64,1783.64," Just getting the reason why there's an, there are reason why we're editors."
1783.64,1786.64, I just saw that shit online.
1786.64,1787.64, That's not the case.
1787.64,1790.64," Actually, and I did mention we have to see if this works."
1790.64,1792.64," You know, I'm determined to make it work."
1792.64,1793.64, But I was talking about the love hate story.
1793.64,1796.64, And it's going to have a life beyond the magazine online.
1796.64,1797.64, Yeah.
1797.64,1800.64," You know, Warren's backers agreed to go in and start things in."
1800.64,1807.64, So everyone else who reads it and who wasn't able to contribute either because they didn't have time or because the PR people.
1807.64,1811.64, Acted as barriers in the way I said that they usually don't.
1811.64,1812.64," I mean, it definitely happened."
1812.64,1813.64, There was a few.
1813.64,1815.64," There was some, I don't know."
1815.64,1817.64," Well, people are saying they were talking about the word."
1817.64,1819.64," But there was some, yeah, there was some deflection going on."
1819.64,1820.64, Yeah.
1820.64,1821.64," It's just, it wasn't a preview."
1821.64,1823.64," So, no, we're not going to like, put you through to someone."
1823.64,1828.64," So it's not, it's not in our interest to have them talk about what they love and hate about being a gay maker."
1828.64,1831.64, It's much as it is to talk about why they love making.
1831.64,1833.64, I don't know.
1833.64,1836.64," Pick on any game, but some random random ass came."
1836.64,1837.64, Okay.
1837.64,1838.64, Scorpion Slayer.
1838.64,1839.64, Scorpion Slayer too.
1839.64,1840.64, Yeah.
1840.64,1841.64, The venture quest.
1841.64,1845.64," So since it wasn't a preview of Scorpion Slayer too, they weren't allowed to contribute."
1845.64,1846.64, Right.
1846.64,1847.64, The manage their time.
1847.64,1856.64," So if all goes well though, they will be able to go online and just had this dialogue will emerge from it and we'll get to see what's really on people's minds."
1856.64,1857.64, Cool.
1857.64,1860.64," And right now, what's on Ryan's minds is this hero of the month."
1860.64,1862.64," Something to hear of the month, dude."
1862.64,1863.64, It's a hero of the month.
1863.64,1864.64, Okay.
1865.64,1868.64, Let me get you up and find the right voice for him.
1868.64,1870.64," I think this guy's a whiskey, whiskey nerd."
1870.64,1872.64," Oh, yay, whiskey nerd."
1872.64,1875.64, That was the most pathetic podcast I've ever heard.
1875.64,1877.64, Referring to Ryan.
1877.64,1880.64," Oh, his comments about Guild Wars is laughable."
1880.64,1883.64, Guild Wars is very complex.
1883.64,1889.64, And it is very possible to beat the encounter that he speak of with the right set of skills and strategy.
1889.64,1893.64, He is just a clueless new who should go back to play bread and butter RPGs like
1893.64,1896.64," Hello Kitty Online, World of Warcraft."
1896.64,1897.64, Ouch.
1897.64,1901.64, I am too good to take note of what nerds and podcasts think of game.
1901.64,1906.64, I see myself as a masterful hardcore gamer who has more knowledge than most.
1906.64,1912.64, And I'm one of the few who are able to grasp the depth of war of Guild Wars.
1912.64,1913.64, He's one of the few.
1913.64,1914.64, I'm sorry.
1914.64,1917.64, I would not expect lesser people to be able to understand though.
1917.64,1921.64, I've clocked in over eight thousand hours in the Guild Wars.
1921.64,1927.64, And I still have not tried more than five to ten percent of the currently existing skill based combinations.
1927.64,1930.64, Eight thousand hours.
1930.64,1932.64, So you read that right.
1932.64,1935.64," Well, and the first thing actually I interacted a little bit of this hero."
1935.64,1938.64, And the first thing was to call on the question.
1938.64,1941.64, The authenticity of that claim.
1941.64,1944.64," But the versity of that claim, rather."
1944.64,1948.64, And he sure enough took a screen cap of his character state.
1948.64,1951.64, And he had more than eight thousand hours on there.
1951.64,1953.64, Which means we did the math.
1953.64,1959.64," And they're being like whatever, like somewhere roughly around two thousand six hundred hours in the year."
1959.64,1961.64," You know, 24 hours days."
1961.64,1965.64," He either he came close to playing, you know, 365 days without sleep."
1965.64,1971.64," Or since in the time that the game has been released, he's played about 12 hours a day."
1971.64,1974.64," And if that's not a poop sucker, I can't tell you what is."
1974.64,1975.64, Wow.
1975.64,1976.64, He's bragging.
1976.64,1978.64," So, but he has a point."
1978.64,1980.64, What the Ryan does Ryan's a whist.
1980.64,1983.64," And actually, yeah, he's a new."
1983.64,1985.64," To be fair, yeah, Ryan's new."
1985.64,1991.64," Because I point out that Ryan, I guess, Ryan had around 800 hours of time invested in that game."
1991.64,1993.64, Invested that I'm using that term.
1993.64,1995.64," Very, very, very seriously."
1995.64,1996.64, Yeah.
1996.64,1998.64," It's returned, have you got it?"
1998.64,1999.64," You know, I don't know."
1999.64,2004.64," And that's when, and I'm like, okay, how do you argue with that, right?"
2004.64,2006.64, How do you argue with 800 hours?
2006.64,2007.64," 8,000 hours."
2007.64,2008.64," Yeah, you're all with it."
2008.64,2009.64, Okay.
2009.64,2010.64," So, the back-up."
2010.64,2014.64," So, Ryan, you, we're going to, we're going to let you chime in here."
2014.64,2015.64," Yeah, this is all you've got to do."
2015.64,2017.64," Rather than just talking about this, this is all you'd be."
2017.64,2018.64, But you wrote this post.
2018.64,2019.64, We talked about it last week.
2019.64,2020.64, Right.
2020.64,2022.64, You wrote about what you could call the post.
2022.64,2024.64, Guild Wars can die and go to hell.
2024.64,2027.64, Which you can read on my blog if you haven't already.
2027.64,2028.64, Uh-huh.
2028.64,2031.64," And Ryan, very hardcore Guild Wars player who was excited."
2031.64,2032.64," Oh, apparently not."
2032.64,2033.64, Apparently not.
2033.64,2034.64," Right, not anymore."
2034.64,2039.64," I was experiencing some, uh, some let down with the game after his 800 hours."
2039.64,2045.64," And, uh, so he wrote that blog and he's been kind of, uh, getting a lot of heat on message boards about it."
2045.64,2050.6400000000003," Well, well, this guy here, um, this is a, from a threat from gaming platforms."
2050.6400000000003,2057.6400000000003," And it's one of several, um, uh, this guy's by far the worst in, in terms of time played."
2057.6400000000003,2058.6400000000003," Uh, his taste."
2058.6400000000003,2059.6400000000003, Or best.
2059.6400000000003,2060.6400000000003, The worst.
2060.6400000000003,2061.6400000000003," Well, the best."
2061.6400000000003,2062.6400000000003, The bad.
2062.64,2063.64, He's a little bit different.
2063.64,2066.64," But what he's straight up about is one of the few who understand, right?"
2066.64,2067.64, Right.
2067.64,2068.64," So he's got, you know, 8,000 hours clock."
2068.64,2071.64, So me with my mere 661 hours.
2071.64,2072.64, A lesser being.
2072.64,2076.64, I clearly do not know anything about this game.
2076.64,2077.64, Noob.
2077.64,2078.64, Right.
2078.64,2083.64," So since I, I made that post on my blog, um, there've been huge threads on, like, uh,"
2083.64,2087.64, GW online.net and Guild Wars guru a couple of the bigger fan sites.
2087.64,2088.64, Uh-huh.
2088.64,2091.64," A lot of people, ragging on me just like this guy."
2091.64,2096.64, But I'm surprised he amount of people who have kind of agreed with the point I made in my blog post.
2096.64,2100.64," Um, because you weren't like saying the game is shit."
2100.64,2105.64," Well, no, I, I, I, I'm not like saying the whole game sucks."
2105.64,2106.64, Right.
2106.64,2109.64, You said a section of the end game is like the really stupid.
2109.64,2116.64," Just some of the logic in the end game, you know, just pile a bunch of mobs together."
2116.64,2120.64," Give him the standard reward that we got, you know, a fact of beginning of the game."
2120.64,2124.64," I think you were just mad at that part of the mission at that point in time, right?"
2124.64,2133.64," I mean, in the same way I took, uh, RC pro and back in the Nintendo, it prompted me to grab my controller court and then take and beat the,"
2133.64,2137.64, the leaving shit out of the controller for a while on the top table.
2137.64,2140.64," But then like after I was done, I picked it back up and played, you know, play me."
2140.64,2144.64," I mean, you actually sense and you've gone back to Guild Wars, I'm, you."
2144.64,2149.64," I have, I, the only time I've logged in since I made this blog post was to check my time."
2149.64,2152.64, It's a delete all of this characters.
2152.64,2153.64, No.
2153.64,2167.64," Um, but all this stuff, all this stuff that I wrote about, you know, like, I actually, um, I heard from arena net by way of their, their PR director."
2167.64,2168.64, Mm-hmm.
2168.64,2172.64, But I guess they were upset about what I had written about.
2172.64,2174.64," Well, you told their game to like, you know, dying go to hell."
2174.64,2177.64," Well, they, and the, the funny thing is they took, they he, equined him."
2177.64,2181.64," I have not spoken with, you know, the developers of Guild Wars yet."
2181.64,2184.64, Because they're like on a plane come and down here to kill you.
2184.64,2185.64, Right.
2185.64,2189.64," But um, but they took it as some sort of like personal attack."
2189.64,2192.64," Well, again, you told their game to die and go to hell."
2192.64,2193.64," Well, you know, personal."
2193.64,2198.64," After you name check the game for like years now, I mean, you've been."
2198.64,2199.64, Right.
2199.64,2200.64, Yeah.
2200.64,2201.64," I mean, nothing."
2201.64,2202.64, Captain Guild Wars.
2203.64,2204.64, Yeah.
2204.64,2212.64," And um, so, you know, I mean, if you go back and reread my blog post, like, my issues with the game are exactly what I stated, my issues with the game are."
2212.64,2216.64, And your issues are the person from the perspective of a pretty hardcore fan.
2216.64,2217.64, Hold on.
2217.64,2218.64, So 1060 hours.
2218.64,2219.64, Okay.
2219.64,2220.64," Now that's hard, Cara."
2220.64,2221.64, Do.
2221.64,2222.64, But yeah.
2222.64,2223.64, Okay.
2223.64,2225.64," So dude, you got 660 hours of enjoyment out of it."
2225.64,2231.64," And like, if you can name something else and fucking, this world you could pay 50 bucks and get that much entertainment out of."
2231.64,2232.64, Yeah.
2232.64,2234.64," I mean, that's a pretty glowing recommendation, right?"
2234.64,2235.64, Right.
2235.64,2236.64, Right.
2236.64,2239.64," Just know that at one point, you're going to get mad and say screw it all."
2239.64,2240.64, Right.
2240.64,2241.64, How many hours?
2241.64,2243.64, How many hours has there been of lost already?
2243.64,2245.64, And everybody already hates that show.
2245.64,2246.64, Right.
2246.64,2247.64, How many has been total?
2247.64,2248.64, Not nearly 660.
2248.64,2252.64, I would estimate about 50 or so.
2252.64,2253.64, Yeah.
2253.64,2254.64, Two.
2254.64,2255.64, Right.
2255.64,2257.64, Hold on to some try to hope.
2257.64,2258.64, It's getting better though.
2258.64,2259.64, Lock it and better.
2259.64,2261.64, We should not turn it in this into a lot less.
2261.64,2262.64, Yeah.
2262.64,2264.64, We should maybe start discussing.
2264.64,2265.64, Yeah.
2265.64,2268.64, We could have a rate we need to make a random ass podcast where we just talk about whatever comes out.
2268.64,2269.64, Come on to mind.
2269.64,2270.64, Don't we do this?
2270.64,2271.64, Cause actually I think something.
2271.64,2272.64," You know, I had something."
2272.64,2274.64, I made myself like one.
2274.64,2275.64," Well, first Ryan."
2275.64,2276.64, Let me let you talk.
2276.64,2278.64, People say people say we need to let you talk.
2278.64,2280.64," Yeah, we talk over you too much."
2280.64,2281.64, Yeah.
2281.64,2282.64, Don't we Ryan?
2282.64,2283.64, Huh?
2283.64,2285.64," Then they say we shouldn't put Ryan on the spot, Ryan."
2285.64,2287.64, We don't want to put you on the spot.
2287.64,2288.64, No.
2288.64,2289.64," We put you on the spot, Ryan."
2289.64,2290.64, No.
2290.64,2301.64," So, so everybody who doesn't understand my point about Guild Wars, go back and reread my blog post."
2301.64,2304.64, Without their psychophant lenses on.
2304.64,2307.64," Well, didn't I mean, the best part you got you showed me email."
2307.64,2312.64, Someone actually said that that you were basically going to kill Guild Wars now because of this.
2312.64,2313.64," Oh, yeah."
2313.64,2314.64, I read this.
2314.64,2315.64, I think I'm.
2315.64,2316.64, I'm playing in there.
2316.64,2317.64, I see W online.
2317.64,2322.64," This guy was like, huh, I just get so scared when the press writes this stuff about this game."
2322.64,2324.64, I think they're just going to shut down in the community.
2324.64,2327.64, You'll shut down and then I don't know what I'll do.
2327.64,2328.64, That's given you a lot of stuff.
2328.64,2329.64, Yeah.
2329.64,2331.64, That makes you a hero of the web.
2331.64,2332.64, Yeah.
2332.64,2333.64, He's got and shut down games.
2333.64,2338.64," And there was another guy who said that things like, like, what I wrote, make him want to kill himself."
2338.64,2341.64, Because I love Guild Wars so much.
2341.64,2342.64," Oh, that's another."
2342.64,2343.64, That's another issue.
2343.64,2344.64, You know.
2345.64,2346.64, That's a champion in the web right there.
2346.64,2347.64, That's you can let another one.
2347.64,2348.64, It's you ford me that dude.
2348.64,2349.64, That's therapy time.
2349.64,2351.64," Oh, I would have read a few more."
2351.64,2354.64, But they're a leg off log off and see a consultant.
2354.64,2356.64," No, not a consultant, a counselor."
2356.64,2358.64, They can solve that works too.
2358.64,2359.64, Yeah.
2359.64,2361.64," So well, you're tying your share of self-acultment consultants."
2361.64,2367.64," And so apparently, I guess the guys are going to get one to talk to me about the stuff I posted."
2367.64,2372.64," And maybe, you know, I'll talk to you on the end, but you know what they say."
2372.64,2373.64, All right.
2373.64,2374.64, That would be good.
2374.64,2375.64, Get back to your side of the story.
2375.64,2376.64, Uh-huh.
2376.64,2377.64, We have a part two.
2377.64,2378.64," And if it's all red and they're like, you know what, Ryan?"
2378.64,2381.64, We just want to talk to you because we're actually about to patch that and make those
2381.64,2382.64, dudes less of notches.
2382.64,2384.64," You know, they're going to change the realm of torment to real life."
2384.64,2385.64, Or they've been right now.
2385.64,2386.64, I'm going to be mad.
2386.64,2389.64," Just like I said, all it takes is you had to grind some unicorn horn and sprinkle it on your"
2389.64,2392.64," sword and it would kill the whole, like mob and like half a second."
2392.64,2393.64," No, you see the thing."
2393.64,2394.64, That's what's going to be dude.
2394.64,2401.64, Another thing that people has been a common counter argument of people who don't understand my blog post.
2401.64,2407.64," Has been that, you know, once you get to this area of the game, you have to change up your tactics to"
2407.64,2410.64," be successful, which, you know, I'm no dummy."
2410.64,2412.64," Like, yes, I have been doing that."
2412.64,2416.64, That's how I was able to get as far as I have in this area.
2416.64,2417.64, Mm-hmm.
2417.64,2418.64, But.
2418.64,2420.64, You can force your way there.
2420.64,2421.64, I don't know that.
2421.64,2424.64, Especially online games change all the time.
2424.64,2430.64," I mean, while it's constantly patching and surfing and counter-nurfing things, I mean, in response to"
2430.64,2432.64, to player complaints.
2432.64,2436.64," I mean, I don't feel like what you did in this blog post was any different than any random"
2436.64,2437.64, while it's a fanatic.
2437.64,2438.64, Right.
2438.64,2440.64," It's not supposed to be a random, wow fanatic."
2440.64,2443.64," He's supposed to be a professional, and that's why we pay him."
2443.64,2445.64," Yeah, but we don't pay him that much."
2445.64,2446.64, All right.
2446.64,2448.64," So, okay."
2448.64,2451.64," So, we're going to take a break and be back with more nonsense."
2451.64,2452.64, Yeah.
2452.64,2454.64," Oh, hello."
2454.64,2455.64, I didn't see there.
2455.64,2456.64, But I think that's a good idea.
2457.64,2458.64," Oh, hello."
2458.64,2459.64, I didn't see there.
2459.64,2463.64," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about E.G.M. live, the weekly podcast from the editors of"
2463.64,2471.64," Electronic Gaming Monthly, along with the wonderful sounds of E.G.M. live comes action-packed with special guests,"
2471.64,2476.64," late-breaking news, fanboy-baiting commentary, behind-scenes tales of Office Tom Follery, and trivia"
2476.64,2478.64, contest with fan tabulous prizes.
2478.64,2483.64, Download it now at E.G.M. live.1up.com or subscribe to it through iTunes.
2484.64,2488.64, E.G.M. live is part of the one-up radio network taking the sick Davis offices and San Francisco.
2488.64,2491.64, It is not actually live and conscious prizes are not guaranteed to be a fan tabulous.
2494.64,2495.64, And we're back.
2495.64,2501.64," I did say that we didn't want to talk about lost and take this down, you know, arbitrary random"
2501.64,2502.64, digression road.
2502.64,2505.64," Yeah, but I had one before we got into this thing."
2505.64,2510.64," I told myself, I was going to find a way to bring it up because everyone's going to be able to relate to it"
2510.64,2513.64," even if they didn't tune into this podcast, they hear what I'm about to say."
2513.64,2516.64," Yeah, everyone out there knows this magic."
2516.64,2519.64," And it's a, I want to what you're talking about."
2519.64,2522.64," Okay, so here's the connection right here."
2522.64,2523.64, Here's the segue.
2523.64,2529.64, We're talking about this being the pledge drive and selling magazines and everything.
2529.64,2533.64," So I just remembered like back when you're in junior high, they always like have these things"
2533.64,2538.64," where they get the kids on some kind of vibe, like drive to sell something."
2538.64,2543.64," Oh, my kids, it was magazine subscriptions or candy bars, yeah, over price stuff."
2543.64,2544.64, And I just thought of that.
2544.64,2550.64," I wanted to talk about that real quick because my, my, my, my, my, my."
2550.64,2556.64," It was so good that they actually had, I mean, it was like a damn like a TV game show or something"
2556.64,2557.64, in junior high.
2557.64,2564.64," They come on and they've got, you know, big, uh, wind, surf, you know, wind sailboards up on the stage and skateboarders"
2564.64,2570.64," and like a ramp and a dude doing tricks and like this robot and, you know, just buckets"
2570.64,2574.64," candy and they're like telling all these kids to come up like, yeah, come on up, you know, and they don't even"
2574.64,2575.64, tell us what's going on.
2575.64,2577.64," We go out to the, you say a robot."
2577.64,2579.64," There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a robot."
2579.64,2580.64," Okay, so let me get it."
2580.64,2581.64, This is going to be hot.
2581.64,2582.64, So we're all there.
2582.64,2584.64, We don't even know what the hell's going on.
2584.64,2587.64," And this dudes up on stage like, hey, you come on up in this."
2587.64,2588.64, So one of us goes up stage.
2588.64,2591.64," And he just gives him a bucket and it's got like, dummy rats,"
2591.64,2594.64, gummi sharks and we're out there just like holy shit.
2594.64,2596.64," You know, like, this kid's getting set."
2596.64,2599.64," You know, tootsie roll, it was like this big as a baby's arm."
2599.64,2604.64," So, you know, they're all this stuff and in the background, then there's like the video screen"
2604.64,2608.64," and it's got due surfing and, you know, I mean, I'm talking like 80's here."
2608.64,2610.64, So this is really hot.
2610.64,2615.64," Yeah, yeah, the dudes on BMX, so it's just, you know, it was just a place to be."
2615.64,2618.64," And then they're like, you know, you get all these stuff, all these prizes."
2618.64,2620.64," You got and sell these magazines, subscriptions."
2620.64,2624.64," But I'm thinking about going it now and for the one kid that is listening, I'll say, don't do this, man."
2624.64,2625.64, They're taking advantage of you.
2625.64,2630.64," They basically turn the tire junior high into like a child labor camp,"
2630.64,2632.64, payable and shady candy.
2632.64,2635.64," So, okay, here's the red part."
2635.64,2637.64," There's a punch like a Ryan, so quick, give me that look."
2637.64,2640.64," When we do this, we go like for like, you know, whatever amount."
2640.64,2641.64, It seems like an eternity.
2641.64,2644.64," I mean, you seem like a year, we go and sell these like shitty magazines,"
2644.64,2647.64," sell them to your grandma, you guilt ship, you know, you're in."
2647.64,2649.64," Sure, they're forced to buy him because they're related."
2649.64,2650.64, Right.
2650.64,2654.64," And then you come back and they had this thing where you get, um, my messed up the whole story."
2654.64,2656.64," You get this ticket, you stick it in the robot."
2656.64,2658.64, That's the robot's for.
2658.64,2659.64, Okay.
2659.64,2663.64," And when we're there for the original assembly, they're sticking these things in the robot and the dude's like,"
2663.64,2665.64, it's not funny.
2665.64,2666.64, You win money.
2666.64,2668.64, You're a prize today.
2668.64,2669.64, $100.
2669.64,2671.64," We're like $100, you know, kids at that age."
2671.64,2672.64, That's all.
2672.64,2674.64, That was like serious cheddar.
2674.64,2676.64, So we have a lot of time.
2676.64,2677.64, That's all right.
2677.64,2678.64, I can't.
2678.64,2682.24, And then so then we do it and then like the first kid goes up and they line us all up to the
2682.24,2686.64," Stam robot with the little punch cards and he's like, you are cool."
2686.64,2689.64," You helped your school, your prize today."
2689.64,2690.64, $1.
2690.64,2693.64," And we're like, uh, whatever, you know, like, it's got to be someone."
2693.64,2694.64," It's not me, whatever."
2694.64,2695.64, And they keep going.
2695.64,2697.64, It's like $1.
2697.64,2698.64, $2.
2698.64,2700.64," Like once every like six or seven, two dollars."
2700.64,2701.64, And that was it.
2701.64,2702.64," Like I swear, there was nothing higher."
2702.64,2704.64," No, denomination higher than two bucks."
2704.64,2706.64, And then it was like a grand prize.
2706.64,2710.64," And uh, this dude, I'm sorry, man."
2710.64,2711.64, I turned this bucket.
2711.64,2712.64, He got to finish.
2712.64,2713.64, Never man.
2713.64,2717.64," This dude gets his, you know, skateboard pads."
2717.64,2722.64," And like I was a skater at time and all of us in the skater click, which is like, mob this kids"
2722.64,2723.64, table.
2723.64,2724.64," You know, like, what did you get?"
2724.64,2725.64," Man, what did you get?"
2725.64,2728.64," Well, by those off of your wreckers, but you get any, and then like my friend Alvin"
2728.64,2730.64, looks and he holds it up.
2730.64,2732.64," This like, nerdy kid's, uh, pads."
2732.64,2734.64," He's like, these are Kmart."
2734.64,2737.64, And then everyone just like dispersed away from the table.
2737.64,2739.64, Like the kid got all excited.
2739.64,2742.64, Like he thought he had something that was red and people cared about it.
2742.64,2743.64," You know, some teamwork pads."
2743.64,2747.64," But anyway, that's, that's, that's how."
2747.64,2750.64, I don't know how I'm going to write this up in the podcast.
2750.64,2752.64," You know, description for this way."
2752.64,2755.64," It's like, it'll show him his own version of the wall."
2755.64,2757.64," Because now, the thing I'm hoping it could backfire."
2757.64,2760.64," I was a million people saying, like, what the hell?"
2760.64,2763.64," I, I described your free podcast and like,"
2763.64,2765.64," you know, the fact that it's a lot of people talking about the"
2765.64,2768.64," play, the fact that it's a lot of people talking about the play"
2768.64,2769.64, strives and junior high.
2769.64,2771.64, Talk about PC games.
2771.64,2774.64," So, or it's going to be like a million kids saying, like, you know, they're doing that now."
2774.64,2777.64," Or they just did that last year, but they told me I was going to get like, you know, a new"
2777.64,2778.64, Mustang or something.
2778.64,2780.64," Yeah, you know, my, my daughter."
2780.64,2784.64," She, she goes to a middle school now and, and she had to do this recently."
2784.64,2785.64," I didn't, we didn't do this at my school."
2785.64,2787.64, This is all I'm going to be in the robots.
2787.64,2790.64," Yeah, and her school, they got this like catalog of shit."
2790.64,2791.64, We both.
2792.64,2793.64," Yeah, they get a lot."
2793.64,2794.64, They give them out.
2794.64,2795.64," No, they give them out."
2795.64,2796.64, They don't fall down.
2796.64,2797.64," Yeah, they're doing it."
2797.64,2801.64," So, so my daughter, they, they pass out this like, right, it's like a catalog."
2801.64,2805.64," And you can pick, you know, my grandma or whoever can pick from a catalog."
2805.64,2807.64, And it's like the most random crap.
2807.64,2808.64, Mm-hmm.
2808.64,2811.64," It's like, you know, on one page, there's wrapping paper on the next page."
2811.64,2815.64," It's like chocolate, you know, chocolate teddy bears, whatever."
2815.64,2818.64," Just like, it's just like,"
2818.64,2823.64," I'm like, I like, I, I like, I like exactly like, please water something for my"
2823.64,2824.64, Candle or salsa.
2824.64,2828.64, That's the 3 in 3 gifts you can get for getting the credit card.
2828.64,2833.64," And he's like, oh, I get to clock the calculator that's also a few."
2833.64,2835.64, So we were tricking you.
2835.64,2837.64, This is about GFW.
2837.64,2838.64, Right.
2838.64,2842.64," And the thing is, when you subscribe to us, you won't have to hide all about this."
2842.64,2844.64, You don't have to buy it for kids.
2844.64,2846.64, You don't have to read articles about this.
2846.64,2848.64," This is, you get a magazine in the intern."
2848.64,2850.64, That's what editing gets you.
2850.64,2852.64, That's all we're going to have to do.
2852.64,2854.64," That article will not have made it in the press, right?"
2854.64,2858.64, That's not what we may not make it under the podcast if we added this.
2858.64,2863.64, The podcast is fun because it's so like night and day to the book.
2863.64,2865.64," You know, it's on point in that out."
2865.64,2868.64," We've got like, we've got the pretty serious, like, you know,"
2868.64,2872.64," and everything we just described about what our mission statement is with the actual print magazine,"
2872.64,2873.64, what we want to do.
2873.64,2876.64," I mean, I take the blame largely, but talk about"
2876.64,2878.64, Junior High Sales Drives.
2878.64,2881.64," It's all these, all this candy we eat before we get there."
2881.64,2883.64, It's going to be all like sugar high.
2883.64,2888.64," So now my kid now, now it's probably not the time to, or is it the time to talk about the red,"
2888.64,2894.64," the red, the red, the world war two preview previews."
2894.64,2896.64," You know what, let's go, let's come back to that."
2896.64,2900.64," Okay, so I wanted to go quick around of, because I haven't done it a little while,"
2900.64,2903.64, and I think we do have a little bit just to ground it back in peace.
2903.64,2905.64," Early gaming, a little bit of what do you plan?"
2905.64,2908.64," Okay, just because we have been playing different things."
2908.64,2909.64, That's true.
2909.64,2914.64, And sort of as a reward for people for putting up with Sean's junior high story there.
2914.64,2916.64, Talk about some PC games.
2916.64,2917.64, I'm sorry.
2917.64,2918.64, I've had to get that thing of my chest.
2918.64,2920.64, That's been there for a while.
2920.64,2921.64, I got more to go.
2921.64,2924.64," Because there's ever 20 years, like an alien chest birster."
2924.64,2925.64, It came out.
2925.64,2926.64, Do you feel better now?
2926.64,2928.64, I feel cleansed.
2929.64,2930.64, So like a new me.
2930.64,2938.64," I feel like the El Run hybrid of Guild Wars, looking down on all you, like, sorry, 800 hours news."
2938.64,2939.64, Lessor being so.
2939.64,2940.64, Are you going to start it really like now?
2940.64,2941.64," In late, already did."
2941.64,2942.64, He just did.
2942.64,2943.64, He just did.
2943.64,2944.64, He just did.
2944.64,2945.64, It involves the robot.
2945.64,2947.64, I'm so what have you been playing?
2947.64,2950.64," You, I mean all you guys have been playing something new, right?"
2950.64,2951.64," I mean, yeah."
2951.64,2952.64, I haven't played it.
2952.64,2956.64," So before I heard Mr. Milai, I've been playing galactic civilizations too."
2956.64,2958.64," Dark Avatar, the expansion pack too."
2958.64,2960.64, One of our games of the year.
2960.64,2961.64, And so far.
2961.64,2962.64, Good. I love that game.
2962.64,2963.64, Yeah.
2963.64,2964.64, And it's kind of just stuck me back into it.
2964.64,2965.64, It's kind of a.
2965.64,2971.64, I haven't gotten enough for far enough in a single game till I really dig into what's coming later.
2971.64,2976.64," But right now, that's already apparent that they've fixed some of the stuff I didn't."
2976.64,2977.64, Really care for before.
2977.64,2978.64, But it did.
2978.64,2979.64, It worked fine.
2979.64,2983.64," But like now that it's fixed, you're like, oh, well, yeah, that would have been the perfect way to do it the first time."
2983.64,2986.64," So there's like, is it a whole new campaign?"
2986.64,2987.64, Yes.
2987.64,2994.64," As a whole new campaign, you play the dragon, which were kind of like the ones who wanted to enslave the galaxy and the last one."
2994.64,2997.64, I smell the prosthetic makeup for the dragon.
2997.64,2999.64," Yeah, they look like monkeys."
2999.64,3000.64, Yeah.
3000.64,3003.64," They have like, they got some latex rubber tape to their face."
3003.64,3005.64," Well, they would in the movie version."
3005.64,3006.64, Yeah.
3006.64,3008.64, Are they actually simians?
3008.64,3009.64, Are they monkeys?
3009.64,3010.64, No.
3010.64,3013.64, So they just have a monkey like appearance.
3013.64,3016.64, Would they object to that description themselves?
3016.64,3018.64, They would object to any description.
3018.64,3019.64, They're that bad ass.
3019.64,3020.64, I don't know.
3020.64,3023.64, The sounds like the guy co in current insurance books.
3023.64,3029.64, What doesn't matter if they look like there's a new campaign with these monkey people.
3029.64,3035.64," And so you're kind of playing the bad guys from the last, the last, like, it's the first game."
3035.64,3037.64," You know, the second game because it's a gelsive too."
3037.64,3042.64," And, but you're playing, you're fighting against like this clan that's even worse than the bad guys."
3042.64,3044.64, So I'm not too far in the campaign.
3044.64,3048.64," You gotta keep starting new, new, like, skirmish games over and over again."
3048.64,3053.64, The idea of an expansion of the game seems overwhelming to me since the original galsive too.
3053.64,3054.64, Yeah.
3054.64,3055.64, So huge.
3055.64,3056.64," I mean, the little I played of it."
3056.64,3059.64," In fact, I admit that's why I stopped because I got overwhelmed."
3059.64,3060.64, Really?
3060.64,3061.64, Uh-huh.
3061.64,3062.64, But overwhelmed you.
3062.64,3063.64," It's the, the sheer."
3063.64,3066.64," I'll, all the buttons and menus and things really."
3066.64,3069.64," I'm scared of it because I like games like, wow, that play themselves."
3069.64,3070.64, Attack.
3070.64,3071.64, And it being a sandwich.
3071.64,3074.64, Editing our writers and it's a shot as well.
3074.64,3077.64," Stories of, on a sense of the solar empire."
3077.64,3078.64, Yeah.
3078.64,3079.64, Also published by Stardog.
3079.64,3081.64," Um, space stretching game."
3081.64,3083.64," It's got me, I, I wanted to jump in."
3083.64,3085.64, I was kind of planning on jumping in at that point.
3085.64,3090.64," And I was wondering if maybe I should do it with galsive, but I mean, that's, that's not too reassuring when you're telling me."
3090.64,3091.64, I don't know.
3091.64,3092.64, I could do a lot of buttons.
3092.64,3093.64," I mean, what do you, what do you, what do you, how is it spread?"
3093.64,3095.64," She, as long as it doesn't boil down to a spreadsheet."
3095.64,3096.64, I'm kind of kidding.
3096.64,3101.64," I mean, it's just a very, you know, there's, it's, it's a hardcore strategy game."
3101.64,3102.64, Right.
3102.64,3103.64, It is turn based.
3103.64,3104.64, It's turn based.
3104.64,3105.64, Yeah.
3105.64,3106.64, I don't love your into that.
3106.64,3107.64, You like the action.
3107.64,3111.64," But I guess anyone, any turn based game coming down to spreadsheets on some level."
3111.64,3112.64, I like all kinds of stuff.
3112.64,3115.64," I mean, the, the turn based, the last turn based stuff to, I do have to."
3115.64,3119.64," I played was, uh, all the, you know, the game cube, advanced work stuff."
3119.64,3121.64," I mean, the closer baby games."
3121.64,3122.64, They are baby games.
3122.64,3124.64," I mean, are you in this civilization in any way, shape or form?"
3124.64,3125.64, That's another one I think.
3125.64,3126.64," Yeah, see."
3126.64,3127.64," It's kind of like, seven."
3127.64,3128.64, I know.
3128.64,3130.64," I'm, like, I've got no excuse."
3130.64,3131.64, It would have been a good weekend too.
3131.64,3135.64," If I wasn't right in that cover story that I'm about to tell you about, uh, we can."
3135.64,3139.64," Well, to, to, to get in and try, save, which I have loaded up through steam ready to play."
3139.64,3140.64," And really, I didn't know."
3140.64,3141.64, I didn't know.
3141.64,3142.64, Siv was on steam.
3142.64,3143.64, Yeah.
3143.64,3144.64," Kidney, it's been on there for like a year."
3144.64,3147.64," That's part of the thing when we, when we gave steam, part of our trend of the year."
3147.64,3151.64," I already said this because, because Siv was on, she should probably read our magazine"
3151.64,3152.64, more often.
3152.64,3153.64, Maybe you should.
3154.64,3155.64," Sorry, back to dark."
3155.64,3156.64, Avatar.
3156.64,3157.64, Avatar?
3157.64,3158.64," Uh, what was I saying?"
3158.64,3160.64," Sorry, you're reviewing it for this issue."
3160.64,3162.64, I am reviewing it for this issue.
3162.64,3164.64," So, and it's looking good so far."
3164.64,3165.64, Yeah.
3165.64,3168.64," I mean, I'm sucked back into it in the same way I was when I first started playing it."
3168.64,3171.64," And it's, it's wonderful because it runs on my laptop really well."
3171.64,3174.64, So I think I've been on the bus in and back from work.
3174.64,3175.64, It's still sitting on my hard drive.
3175.64,3179.64," I feel a little weird playing it because it's so geeky looking, like, sitting at next to the people on the"
3180.64,3181.64, the people on the uni.
3181.64,3182.64, Yeah.
3182.64,3183.64, Yeah.
3183.64,3185.64, I have a problem with that with all all games on my laptop when I'm on the plane.
3185.64,3186.64, Everyone's in a while.
3186.64,3189.64, I'll be on a plane and I'll see a guy playing the excivalization or age of empires.
3189.64,3192.64," And when I was like, right on, that's cool."
3192.64,3193.64, That's so great.
3193.64,3195.64, You're doing that because I would never do that.
3195.64,3197.64," And I do this for like, I kind of like that about."
3197.64,3199.64," I got like, like, a warcraft hat on."
3199.64,3200.64, Plans.
3200.64,3201.64," I was like, that's about my video."
3201.64,3202.64, Give magazine some time.
3202.64,3205.64," And then I got to a point where I'm like, dude, this is what I do for a living."
3205.64,3206.64, How am I going to be able to do it?
3206.64,3209.64," I'm going to do it as you know on the on the trade, but comic books I still don't."
3209.64,3212.64," I still can't bring it into if it's a trade paperback, maybe."
3212.64,3215.64," Can't read comic book on the part, which is a regional job."
3215.64,3219.64," I got, I got a problem with that with what reading comic books."
3219.64,3220.64, Yeah.
3220.64,3221.64, On the on the on the whatever.
3221.64,3222.64, Yeah.
3222.64,3224.64," And then we're really, although on time I was reading the walking dead."
3224.64,3227.64," And like some guy got into a really, really scary conversation with me about this."
3227.64,3229.64," Like, like comic books."
3229.64,3230.64," Like a, wow."
3230.64,3231.64, Nice.
3231.64,3233.64," Like, you want candy little boy sort of thing."
3233.64,3234.64, Yeah.
3234.64,3235.64, Like that.
3235.64,3236.64, You got to grow up.
3236.64,3242.64," I got traumatized one time when I was, I tried to, I used to not be self-conscious about"
3242.64,3244.64," gaming or comic, so whatever in public."
3244.64,3245.64, I had to self-righteous.
3245.64,3246.64, This is what I do.
3246.64,3249.64," And if you can't handle it, you're not mature."
3249.64,3256.64," But I was, I was in Berkeley standing outside on, on Shadak Avenue, waiting for my wife and kid to"
3256.64,3257.64, shop.
3257.64,3259.64," We were going to, the three of us were going to the movies."
3259.64,3263.64, I'm a standing on on the sidewalk and I was playing my game boy.
3263.64,3266.64, I was actually playing a Pokemon I admit.
3266.64,3271.64," And I'm sure I was probably, this wasn't that long ago, so I was probably, you know, late 30s,"
3271.64,3272.64, early 40s.
3272.64,3275.64, Playing Pokemon on the sidewalk.
3275.64,3278.64, I'm standing there and this mom walks by with her kid.
3278.64,3282.64," And this boy, he's got to be, you know, he's like no older than six or seven."
3282.64,3285.64, And he's holding the mom stand and the two of them walk by.
3285.64,3288.64," And as they're walking by, the kid is doing like a double take."
3288.64,3289.64, It's like slowly turning around.
3289.64,3290.64, Yeah.
3290.64,3291.64, And he stops.
3291.64,3294.64," He like breaks away from his mom and he walks over to me and he goes,"
3294.64,3296.64, Are you a kid?
3296.64,3297.64, Yeah.
3297.64,3298.64, That's right.
3298.64,3301.64, I thought you were going to say you broke out of Link cable.
3301.64,3302.64," No, but I'm even better."
3302.64,3305.64," I said, no, no, I'm in adult."
3305.64,3308.64," And like as I'm saying that, you know, the mom, like sweeps the skid out like,"
3308.64,3309.64, I'm doing a man.
3309.64,3311.64, Just like molester on the sidewalk.
3311.64,3312.64, I'm going to pick them up on the sun.
3312.64,3313.64, Yeah.
3313.64,3315.64," That's because I, you know, no, it's my job."
3315.64,3317.64, Don't look at me like that on the train with me.
3317.64,3320.64," Because I've been like, you know, I remember, I've been reading the EGM or something."
3320.64,3324.64, And there would be like a mom and her kid and the kid is keeps looking over.
3324.64,3326.64," And then the mom would be like, he sees that."
3326.64,3327.64, He sees that.
3327.64,3328.64, He sees that.
3328.64,3329.64, He had that.
3329.64,3331.64, She had that just give it to him.
3331.64,3332.64," You know, I didn't."
3332.64,3333.64, I didn't.
3333.64,3336.64, I tell you guys about the time when I ran into Guy reading our magazine at the Seattle airport.
3336.64,3337.64," Well, yeah."
3337.64,3338.64, He didn't give a crap.
3338.64,3339.64, Yeah.
3339.64,3340.64, Absolutely.
3340.64,3341.64, I write that.
3341.64,3342.64, Yeah.
3342.64,3343.64, This guy was just guy was talking to him.
3343.64,3344.64, Yeah.
3344.64,3347.64," He's probably like, so probably in his like, this one's douchey dude."
3347.64,3349.64, I didn't realize how douchey wasn't till after.
3349.64,3352.64, And then I felt like the biggest loser.
3352.64,3355.64, He was sitting there waiting for his flight and he's reading our magazine.
3355.64,3357.64, And I like walked by and I saw it.
3357.64,3360.64," And I like walked by him twice and I'm like, this was so cool."
3360.64,3366.64," And so I thought maybe he would think it was cool if he, you know, met me."
3366.64,3368.64," Oh, or someone from our magazine."
3368.64,3370.64," That's like, I don't think that though."
3370.64,3372.64, What would make you think that?
3372.64,3376.64," You think it maybe it was cool if this dude would be like, hey, man, you're the cause."
3376.64,3378.64," I don't know, like, want my autograph."
3378.64,3379.64, You did.
3379.64,3380.64, You wouldn't tell them.
3380.64,3381.64, You wouldn't tell them.
3381.64,3382.64, All right.
3382.64,3384.64," Time magazine, if you like."
3384.64,3386.64," Yeah, he, no, I said, so I write for that magazine."
3386.64,3390.64," And he looked at me like, why the, why the hell should I give it to you?"
3390.64,3391.64, No.
3391.64,3392.64, And then I just saw anyway.
3392.64,3393.64, I'm read.
3393.64,3394.64, I'm leaving now.
3394.64,3397.64, I hope you enjoyed this story on the podcast.
3397.64,3398.64, Did I already did.
3398.64,3400.64, And I told the story about poison.
3400.64,3403.64," Didn't I, but my friend running into the band poison in the L.A."
3403.64,3404.64, 11.
3404.64,3405.64," Yes, right after."
3405.64,3406.64, You did.
3406.64,3407.64, That's the word.
3407.64,3408.64, So that's the word.
3408.64,3409.64, We're just 11.
3409.64,3410.64, Our glory day.
3410.64,3411.64, So I'm.
3411.64,3412.64, Okay.
3412.64,3413.64, So wait a minute.
3413.64,3415.64, If you ran into.
3415.64,3416.64, I never mind.
3416.64,3417.64, Forget it.
3417.64,3418.64, I'm here to the story.
3418.64,3420.64, Let's take it back for two days of it.
3420.64,3421.64, So he goes into 7.
3421.64,3425.64," 11 and they see poison, like at least three members of the band poison goes."
3425.64,3426.64, Holy shit.
3426.64,3428.64, You guys are poison aren't you?
3428.64,3429.64, Like the main guy goes.
3429.64,3431.64," Yeah, do you want her autograph?"
3431.64,3432.64," He goes like, no."
3433.64,3434.64, That's a way.
3434.64,3435.64, So there you have it.
3435.64,3436.64, There's the point of.
3436.64,3438.64, Of your of yours.
3438.64,3439.64, You know.
3439.64,3440.64, And now we're.
3440.64,3441.64, We're experiencing the same point.
3441.64,3443.64, That actually looked a bond again man.
3443.64,3444.64, Let's start this.
3444.64,3445.64, Let's start this.
3445.64,3447.64, It's kind of what this podcast is like.
3447.64,3448.64, Which.
3448.64,3449.64, Which actually.
3449.64,3451.64, Because I was going to tell the story.
3451.64,3452.64, And now I'm going to.
3452.64,3455.64, Of the time when I was in a music show with this body of mine.
3455.64,3457.64, We were in junior high.
3457.64,3458.64, And he was a kiss fan.
3458.64,3459.64," And in fact, not English."
3459.64,3460.64, It kissed fan.
3460.64,3461.64, He was in the kiss army.
3461.64,3464.64, So back then you had to like mail away for turned out as mom did.
3464.64,3465.64, Gene Simmons.
3465.64,3467.64," No, no, no, no."
3467.64,3469.64, It's just going back to.
3469.64,3470.64, And I hated kiss.
3470.64,3473.64," So I, you know, he and I were always arguing about what bands were cool."
3473.64,3475.64, And he thought kiss was cool.
3475.64,3479.64, So we walked in the circuser because he was waiting for their new album.
3479.64,3480.64, Love gun to come out.
3480.64,3482.64, And we walked into the store.
3482.64,3483.64, Sounds like a great.
3483.64,3484.64, A ratchet and client game.
3484.64,3485.64, Love gun.
3485.64,3486.64, So we want to go to.
3486.64,3488.64, How do you get it?
3489.64,3490.64, It's so glad I had it.
3490.64,3491.64, Good name.
3491.64,3493.64, So we walk into the store.
3493.64,3497.64," And yeah, he goes up to the clerk and he says, hey, I just wanted to know when"
3497.64,3498.64, Love gun is coming out.
3498.64,3501.64, And the clerk's answer is who gives a fuck.
3501.64,3502.64, That's red.
3502.64,3503.64, That's red.
3503.64,3504.64, All right.
3504.64,3505.64, Let's do it.
3505.64,3506.64, All right.
3506.64,3507.64, Let's do it.
3507.64,3508.64, Now playing the Jeff.
3508.64,3512.64, Now I remember because I'm the one who abstained from the big giant six foot
3512.64,3513.64, Bong back there and Jeff.
3513.64,3515.64, You're going to talk to that.
3515.64,3516.64, You're playing silverfall now.
3517.64,3519.64," Yeah, well, I'm trying to play silverfall."
3519.64,3520.64, I feel a little bad about it.
3520.64,3521.64, I would.
3521.64,3522.64, This was a game out of the sign to review.
3522.64,3525.64," And it's an action RPG along the lines of the,"
3525.64,3526.64, Diablo and Titan Quest.
3526.64,3529.64, I just reviewed the Titan Quest expansion and the new issue.
3529.64,3531.64, I gave it a glowing nine out of ten stars.
3531.64,3532.64, So I'm all.
3532.64,3534.64, There's no stars.
3534.64,3535.64, Whatever.
3535.64,3536.64, Nine out of ten numerals.
3536.64,3537.64, There's still a few.
3537.64,3538.64, What?
3538.64,3541.64, It was the last time you looked at your magazine.
3541.64,3542.64, It was.
3542.64,3544.64, What do we call?
3544.64,3546.64, It wasn't a six foot bargain.
3546.64,3547.64, It was a new footbar.
3547.64,3551.64," I mean, listen, I gave game stars for eight years."
3551.64,3552.64, I don't like it.
3552.64,3554.64, I got me some slack.
3554.64,3556.64, So I'm okay with the action RPG.
3556.64,3559.64, I'm okay with the Diablo S game and.
3559.64,3561.64, You're not okay with silverfall.
3561.64,3565.64," I'm not, but I feel a little bad talking about it now because it's feels a little bit like"
3565.64,3567.64, picking on the special ed kid.
3567.64,3571.64," It's that why I mean, like the French special ed kid."
3571.64,3572.64, Was it made on?
3573.64,3575.64," Yeah, what was it?"
3575.64,3577.64, It just made on food stamps or what?
3577.64,3578.64, Like what's it?
3578.64,3580.64," Yeah, it's it's a bit low rent."
3580.64,3587.64," You know, it's it's a Diablo clown that takes up ten gigs on your hard drive and plays like a game from 1997."
3587.64,3590.64," So look, that's my room."
3590.64,3591.64, That's my review.
3591.64,3595.64," Actually, the biggest problem having a silverfall now and is that it."
3595.64,3600.64, They apparently this was the developers sort of thought to the idea of corpsons back from ever
3600.64,3603.64, across one were a good idea and they missed those.
3603.64,3605.64, So they added them to their RPG.
3605.64,3608.64," You know, the corpson is fan guard hasn't too."
3608.64,3609.64, So thank God that's a.
3609.64,3610.64," Oh, you have to go back and fetch."
3610.64,3613.64, If you go if you're out in the wherever.
3613.64,3615.64," Yeah, and you get killed by monsters."
3615.64,3616.64, That sounds hard.
3616.64,3623.64, All the stuff that you were you were caring is gone until you go back to where you died and you click on your little tombs done to get it back.
3623.64,3626.64," Yeah, the problem with this game is so it does that."
3626.64,3629.64, And if you and I'm right at the beginning of this game.
3629.64,3631.64," So, you know, I've I've alluded a few things."
3631.64,3636.64, I've got enough armor and and a weapon to to kill the level two and three mobs.
3636.64,3638.64, I get a little bit further out.
3638.64,3639.64, I get killed.
3639.64,3646.64, And I have nothing to wear to get back to where I started because it's still the beginning of the game.
3646.64,3647.64, Do the mobs respond.
3647.64,3650.64, They respond and they kill me like a second.
3650.64,3652.64," I mean, like the second the first time I die."
3652.64,3654.64," I mean, how do I feel bad for that?"
3654.64,3658.64, You don't need a big budget to know that that's a boneheaded ass thing to put in your game.
3658.64,3662.64," Yeah, the great thing is that you're actually almost naked by the second."
3662.64,3668.64," Like literally like the first time you die, then you're just going to have like the starter apprentice robot."
3668.64,3670.64," So you still got something in the wooden sword, whatever."
3670.64,3673.64, So you've still got a little bit of a fighting stance.
3673.64,3675.64," So if you die the second time, you've got nothing."
3675.64,3677.64, So you look like a boar at it.
3677.64,3679.64, And I took a screenshot of this.
3679.64,3685.64, I at my human character is he is running through the wilderness now in a thong and nothing else.
3685.64,3687.64, And I don't want to see that.
3687.64,3689.64, I don't want to play that.
3689.64,3692.64, I don't need to play a guy and naked guy in the thong with no weapon.
3692.64,3694.64, You need to you need to different games.
3694.64,3695.64, That's a different game.
3695.64,3696.64, That's a lot of else.
3696.64,3697.64, That's a real body.
3697.64,3698.64, It's equivalent of your own body.
3698.64,3700.64, I don't want you to be ashamed of it.
3700.64,3702.64," Well, I don't want to be that guy."
3702.64,3704.64, I want clothes on a weapon.
3704.64,3705.64, Sorry.
3705.64,3706.64, Maybe you don't get better.
3706.64,3708.64, That corpse run in a single player.
3708.64,3709.64, It wasn't anything.
3709.64,3710.64," See, that's what I'm saying."
3710.64,3713.64, Why do you have a corpse run in a single player RPG?
3713.64,3718.64, Maybe the folks from who made silver falcon can tell me.
3718.64,3719.64, But it's not making me want to.
3719.64,3722.64," There's some asshole out there that's just like saying,"
3722.64,3723.64, How like that's true.
3723.64,3726.64," And like, well, the whole thing, like the same $8,000 clock"
3726.64,3728.64," who told Ryan, he's a friend because of eight thousand hours."
3728.64,3731.64, You've got to be some kind of like massacist to be a true gamer.
3731.64,3732.64, Right.
3732.64,3733.64, Like screw those people.
3733.64,3734.64," Well, that's how I felt that."
3734.64,3735.64, They always bring their suit right now.
3735.64,3736.64," They're like, they're like, they're like,"
3736.64,3737.64," They're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like,"
3737.64,3739.64," they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like,"
3739.64,3740.64," they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like,"
3740.64,3742.64," they're like, they're in many hours in this game on Sunday."
3742.64,3745.64," And after a while, I was like, I don't need this in my life."
3745.64,3748.64, Yeah.
3748.64,3749.64, I play RPGs all the time.
3749.64,3751.64, I played every single might and magic.
3751.64,3752.64, I played all the ultimales.
3752.64,3753.64, I know how to play these games.
3753.64,3755.64, I played the elbows on the action side.
3755.64,3757.64," I, I'm not a new, but these games."
3757.64,3759.64, And this game was so frustrating.
3759.64,3761.64," And there was just like, who's, whose idea is it,"
3761.64,3766.64," who thinks that making a game so hard that你 know,"
3766.64,3769.64, that you're going to be angry within the first half hour?
3769.64,3770.3199999999997, Is a good idea?
3770.32,3777.04," The next level is going to be more the same if I'm right. I mean, correct me from wrong. Yeah, if it's a hack and slash RPG"
3777.52,3781.06, Once you do get by this part you're just going to be hacking and slash and some more dudes
3781.06,3785.2200000000003," It's up just the color of their horns are going to change or some shit, right? Right, so I'm worn out"
3785.2200000000003,3790.3, I'm in the newbie area. I'm tired. The reason I make out the plan is crazy make that point
3790.3,3794.56," It's like okay, maybe if you had this game with like wildly different levels where it's like okay"
3794.56,3799.48, We could stagger your time on this one just a little bit make you do some shit like that jump through these hoops
3799.48,3803.48, Because as soon as you do get by this all of a sudden it's going to be all different
3803.48,3806.84, But if you do get by that you're just going to be looking forward to more
3807.76,3810.6," Speedo runs over and over and over again, you know"
3810.92,3818.0," It's just going to be like maybe if they just called it speedo run speedo fall. Yeah, and I knew what I was going for draw drop"
3821.0,3826.16, After people listen to this podcast after the guys on those go wash front listen to this podcast. I bet you
3826.16,3827.16, I'm
3827.16,3830.2799999999997, Don't be posting like man. This guy's really just suck at games
3831.44,3837.64, You're going to get a letter that says I didn't have any trouble with that first area. I did it that do can't even trace over fall and
3838.16,3844.54, Have to pass the first area. It's not just to buy a business close on I'm getting it. Maybe I shouldn't have talked about this
3844.7599999999998,3846.7599999999998, Maybe we have to edit it out
3846.7599999999998,3853.52," Well, we're editing up 20 minutes of it. It's gonna be nothing left. Well, why would you know we're not by I know"
3853.52,3855.52, How much you know I think the knitting a thing
3856.16,3860.3199999999997, Don't make it wrong about that. This is just inexplicably appears in the front page of one
3860.3199999999997,3862.3199999999997, I'm talking about

3863.3199999999997,3866.3599999999997, That's it for the reason. We're making that a special edition all day as well. Yeah
3867.0,3869.72, So that's what I've been playing so over fall
3871.12,3874.16, And I'm wow recommending it so far so it's pretty cool
3875.12,3877.12," Okay, then"
3877.12,3879.12, Anyone else

3900.52,3902.52, It's great 10 out of 10
3904.48,3911.88," Okay, you don't have any professional journalists against I'd to add what what is that?"
3912.2,3915.04," What's yeah, so you're doing more song culture. Yeah, yeah"

3951.16,3953.7999999999997, Or well you're naming convention on that sorry marks of honor
3955.0,3957.0, Badging criminations what they are
3958.2799999999997,3960.2799999999997," Well, those are higher level"
3960.96,3963.4," Yeah, you should get unled in dirty thread with a little dry"
3963.4,3968.6, I will make it get ready to admit being there what up network's official world of workcraft podcast
3970.32,3971.32, Need you
3971.32,3973.76, So now I'm working my war lock up to 29
3974.08,3979.28," Wow, you got two levels 29 characters. Well, I have the war lock that little 25 right now"
3980.2000000000003,3984.76, Set your the hours are starting to add up and that came for you pretty soon. I'll maybe I'll be able to
3985.2400000000002,3987.2400000000002," Maybe I'll be in 8,000 hour of that"
3987.96,3989.96, soon
3990.92,3992.92, Any great
3993.92,4000.76," I'm glad you're still playing I know I thought maybe it was just gonna be a passing thing for you, but now you're your few weeks into it"
4000.76,4004.44, We'll see I mean you know what the funny thing like when I first started playing
4005.7200000000003,4007.08, a few weeks ago
4007.08,4008.12, I
4008.12,4011.84, It sort of just maybe want to play guild wars and that's what I did I went and
4012.7200000000003,4018.84, Like I'm gonna play guild wars and then I hit this this wall and stopped and now I'm playing wow
4020.04,4024.68, You're like you're having a relationship troubles with one and then you go and try to meet the new girl and you're like wow
4024.68,4028.04," This is exciting. I can I can feel this but you're like, oh, but it's not"
4028.68,4033.88, It's not a Sally and then you go back to old Sally. I didn't write she's she bitches at you when you're like gosh
4033.88,4035.88, She hasn't changed one bit
4035.88,4038.28, Go back up to the other one. That's where you're ever
4039.48,4043.08," Two timer breaking it down. Okay, you know the science"
4045.4,4049.32," Sean you got anything you're playing. Oh, no much because of him"
4049.4,4051.4, Working but
4051.8,4057.88, I've been playing the stalker multiplayer beta and not really so much to say about that because it's pretty straightforward
4058.52,4060.52, Death match team death match and
4060.84,4063.48, Single flag CTF otherwise known as artifact hunt
4064.2000000000003,4066.6800000000003, Which is like the new trend now. Do you think I mean?
4066.6800000000003,4071.96, Did you think the multi players gonna matter a lot in stalker because we're gonna be more about you know
4072.6800000000003,4076.6800000000003, You never really know because like company of here. I mean a couple of years
4077.0,4079.7999999999997, Come with here is mild players incredible. We're talking about call duty
4080.7599999999998,4085.56, Two multipliers. It's just so basic. It's just basically the weapons of the game and some like small math
4085.56,4087.56, But it had a huge following
4087.56,4092.04, So you never really know and the rafts were just reworked from assets from a single player campaign
4092.2799999999997,4096.36, So it's like you never know to just dismiss something on those grounds because
4097.639999999999,4103.639999999999, There are so many first person shooters on PC that that basically worked that way that it gets to the point where
4104.04,4109.240000000001, You're willing to play another one just because like the settings are slightly different so you're movement speed
4109.240000000001,4111.240000000001, Like whether or not you can become fatigued
4111.64,4115.64, The way that you swap out your weapons away the weapons feel weapon you know
4116.04,4120.12, Accuracy and recoil and it does have a good feel. I mean I definitely have fun playing it
4120.76,4126.6, One potential problem I see it already though and I can't I don't know how they're gonna get around it
4127.0,4128.360000000001, Is that
4128.44,4134.44, It's a buy-in structure like counter strike but rather in team based uh it's individual based you you know you're in your own money
4134.759999999999,4138.759999999999," You do a counter strike too, but so you earn your own money like if you're doing it in death match"
4139.719999999999,4146.599999999999, And that enables you to buy better armor better weapons ammo scopes for um grenade launchers to sling underneath them
4147.799999999999,4151.88, All these all these other cool things you know health down to health packs and to like radioactive
4151.88,4154.04, Anodot's for when you walk through a radioactive zone
4154.28,4158.68, But the problem is is that you lose all your money when you start getting killed and then
4159.24,4163.88, The people that are good and they're on a spree are getting more and more and more and buying the better the better weapons
4164.12,4169.4, You get to the point where they've got the god armor on they've got like hands down like just the complete god weapon rifles
4169.64,4171.64, The sniper rifles aren't saying because
4171.64,4175.32, You have a crosshair whether you're zoomed or not and they have like almost no
4176.68,4178.2, recoil
4178.2,4181.96, So anyway like long story short. I think that's going to be a problem and
4182.2,4186.6, They'll I assume they'll patch it well it sounds to me like the answer there. It's just don't suck
4187.08,4191.32," Yeah, but the game itself and yeah, that that's the part that's easy enough to like to deal with"
4192.04,4196.36, At the same time they're using that to differentiate it from other games some of the other cool stuff
4196.36,4200.44, I mean the other the only other things that are like different about it or that it has yeah
4200.44,4205.16," Like sort of not real time, but has a dynamic weather changing time and day change and stuff"
4205.4,4210.12, So you could start a map of dust and then it gets night and it's crazy then you get your cool and the g-goggle
4210.12,4215.5599999999995," Mean that during the course of the map during the course of the match. Yeah, very or you could start when kicks up and it starts raining"
4215.5599999999995,4218.44, And that stuff feels cool. I mean it's always doing some different the map feels
4218.92,4224.04, Different if it's dark or light and then there is a same electromagnetic and anomalies that are in the single player game
4224.04,4230.599999999999, Where you know you could walk into one and it creates like a little whirlwind and throws you open to the air has there been a shooter ever that has done a
4231.64,4236.76, A time change during the course of a battle not to my knowledge. I mean I know you know when we're we're looking at
4237.0,4243.4800000000005," When we were first looking at enemy territory quick, where's there making a big deal about the fact that it's so easy for them to change times of days on maps"
4243.4800000000005,4247.8, And I know there have been several where like a battlefield they'll take
4248.280000000001,4252.280000000001," You know, I'm sure in other maps too. They take maps that you know and change the time of day on"
4253.400000000001,4258.4800000000005, But then but you have to load them as a separate map. It doesn't actively do it as your playing the game
4258.4800000000005,4264.02, I think it'll be pretty common going ahead crisis is definitely that's a big deal in that game
4264.26,4269.860000000001, They're talking about setting it up where you're playing just like these full because you could set the clock to work at however many
4270.02,4274.9800000000005, However many times fast as as real time as you want where you're going through these long epic cycles and
4275.38,4283.1," Flashlights and headlights come on at night and you're searching around through the forest and dark and then the sun comes up and I mean, so I think it's gonna be big in shooters"
4283.820000000001,4285.820000000001, I think that's a great idea
4285.820000000001,4290.06," Kind of I'm trying to be excited. I'm thinking about you know, that's cool. I'm looking forward to that"
4290.06,4292.06, But I'm sitting here Ryan's like
4292.06,4295.740000000001, Gratian is head think of planning this next stuff. We're so on galt run
4296.34,4298.34," Yeah, it's an exciting galt run"
4299.02,4306.46," Yeah, we all kind of like different games around here. We do you know I saw a comment on the podcast on I think gaming age about how"
4307.18,4315.860000000001, How they wished on this podcast that there were more shooter fans who could like call you on shit when you're talking about your shooter stuff
4316.14,4318.9400000000005," Rather than I'll talk on like yeah, Sean well anyway back to"
4318.94,4325.099999999999," Yeah, I mean, that's funny though. Yeah, I mean, because the other different perspectives on shooters people can I"
4325.099999999999,4329.099999999999, I used to play shooters. I think a lot of them just dead dead wrong at times
4329.099999999999,4333.9," I mean, I saw some like criticism on former things have said recently like about shadow run and"
4334.0599999999995,4335.66, I think it's just either you know
4335.66,4338.62, I could take the blame and say I didn't articulate it well enough or
4339.66,4343.099999999999, Or they just didn't get the point I play most single player shooters
4343.099999999999,4347.74, I just don't really play multiplayer that much anymore. I got the whole you know reflex
4347.82,4355.66," Yeah, I don't know though. I haven't gotten any worse at all like now"
4355.66,4361.5, I could pick up that you guys wait so caliber or you know are the shooters I play all time and get into the groove and
4361.9,4364.38," You know, huh? Yeah, it's good like I was just playing no day"
4364.38,4366.7, I was playing stalker and damn you and come spy and it was like great
4366.7,4370.38, It's just like you know when you're playing and you've got like a reputation of upholding being good
4370.38,4373.34," Yeah, and like someone comes by and is just perfect timing"
4373.34,4376.0599999999995, I just was on this crazy streak and any time someone would appear on my screen
4376.14,4380.22, I get them with a headshot and then just keep moving and this is like this is the right timing when day meals
4380.22,4383.02, They're not telling them how it makes it so much better for griefing when you're actually
4383.580000000001,4386.3, capable or competent the game because then you can do the whole uh
4387.34,4391.1, Instead of just being the guy that sucks and they're starting shit. You could be the guy like well my grandma
4391.1,4394.9400000000005, I say I shouldn't make fun of people who aren't as good as me because it's not their fault
4395.900000000001,4401.740000000001," Or like or or like if they get mad I did another thing where I said like yeah, I'm playing from school"
4401.740000000001,4405.18, Where I live in the teacher gave me hacks don't let one of the playing field
4406.3,4408.3, Yeah
4408.9400000000005,4414.700000000001," Okay, so we we're moving on we got a few more items though. We do we do Sean. Oh, we've got a chance test"
4415.42,4417.42," Yeah, on test right now"
4417.42,4422.700000000001," Um, and I'm gonna make it with the help of Yackety Yak Block who's one of our our former members"
4423.900000000001,4427.18, And this is all his idea actually I said I'd be down for a contest and
4427.580000000001,4431.5, Here's his excellent idea. It's basically what you're gonna do so you're gonna go through
4432.700000000001,4435.580000000001, Your the subscriptions that you just ordered for GFW
4436.54,4443.580000000001," No, you're gonna go through our magazine and through their reviews and find reviews of like games that that's poured fairly and if you don't have a copy"
4444.14,4446.14, It's a port fairly
4448.14,4450.9400000000005, So you're gonna go for a wister turt
4450.9400000000005,4453.580000000001, And find games that put that port fairly
4455.18,4457.18, poorly
4457.740000000001,4462.700000000001, So spoonerisms uh we're gonna so you're gonna go through and find games that fared poorly
4463.66,4467.9, And with those you're gonna create a composite you're gonna take and you're not gonna add a single word
4467.9,4470.38, But you're gonna just take pieces that exist and
4470.78,4476.94, Using you know bracketed ellipses of your own put together a view and so it seems absolutely positive
4477.5,4482.0599999999995, Is that worth it if the if the review said if we had said in their view
4482.22,4484.22, This was a pretty fucking shitty game
4484.62,4486.62, You take out the
4486.62,4487.82, Fucking shitty part so
4487.82,4495.82," And that's a pretty game yeah games for windows, but you have to indicate that omission with with the lip sees it's in a pair of brackets, you know right"
4497.099999999999,4500.46, And and you can't rearrange can't rearrange yours no
4500.94,4505.0199999999995," Yeah, it's not like you just take it and you're it's like when you break it down to the alphabet well"
4505.0199999999995,4508.139999999999, There's an A here it'll be here and I can write that together with the
4508.139999999999,4513.179999999999, I don't know what this is this is a lesson in being a marketing person right and being yeah putting like the box copy
4513.18,4519.34, See on a box right like anytime you see a movie and the and the review or the blurb on it just says fun
4520.46,4522.46, You know
4522.46,4524.46," Yeah, you know not to touch it"
4524.46,4528.700000000001," Yeah, the last movies I remember that had that were like both shack movies the Kazam"
4529.1,4531.740000000001, Kazan got on Lumberly supply and
4532.700000000001,4534.700000000001, Was this other one steel steel
4535.5,4542.22, So both of those had fun on you know was probably like it's so like it's almost funny how shitty this movie is and
4542.780000000001,4549.34," Turn into if it's your idea of fun. Yeah, you should go kill you. So okay, so you're gonna do that and you're gonna submit"
4549.5,4551.5, What you put together on the
4551.66,4559.26, Games for windows forms on on up.com. I'll make it thread for that and if you beat me to it if you're like if you're here in this and you go on there
4559.26,4563.1, It's not right you can go ahead and start it and I'll go over them in next week all now
4563.1,4564.780000000001, It's winter is no have two or three
4564.780000000001,4568.54, Prize boxes of stuff that we collect from around here basically much swag and crap
4568.86,4573.82, Maybe a few surprises some games in there. Oh some gummy bears dirty gummy bears
4573.82,4576.3, Bar's cookies and some some flowers
4578.3,4580.3, Here you go here's your shit
4580.3,4583.1," Yeah, and I'll get it come on try the contest"
4583.58,4584.86, So
4584.86,4586.86," So yeah, we got that and then"
4586.86,4592.86, I guess it's not I'll save it for next time the whole uh oh your quote red or I can we can go out on it or what
4593.42,4598.14," We can go on it. Yeah, you want to be the kill joy. No, no you can go out on it. Okay"
4598.54,4602.94, So I'm missing the key one but just reminded me I I was looking at
4604.46,4609.18," Either a here's one of those not naming name things and I was to be fair. Okay, so here's a deal"
4609.18,4615.1, I looked at a preview for a worldward a game set in worldward who and it had like the intro that I hate the one
4615.1,4620.06," I'm always saying like oh god, I don't ever write that like why do you do it and so to be fair"
4620.06,4625.9, I collected a whole bunch from just like that had gone up in the past couple months or whatever and that were on all websites
4625.9,4629.5, Our own included to be fair. I won't say who but all the major ones and magazines and just
4630.0599999999995,4635.0199999999995, Found some and so what I read to you each one is from the first paragraph of
4635.82,4640.78, Previews on worldward or two games and you tell me if you know the team here so they're from different magazines different websites
4640.78,4646.0599999999995," In fact different games two different games. Okay, okay, and I won't read this in a messed up voice or anything"
4646.0599999999995,4650.0599999999995, Because this is more of a rire thing the only reason I do this is because like even for our own writers
4650.0599999999995,4654.78, It's like just like I want to push you to to find a better solution better way about it
4655.259999999999,4662.54," So okay, here we go. Well worldward two has been played out countless video games and more specifically if you are T.S. is this particular title stood out last"
4662.54,4666.86, E3 thanks to some stunning visuals advanced AI and great potential for environmental gameplay
4667.9,4669.5, Number two
4669.5,4673.98, It's no secret that much of the worldward two first person due shooter genre has grown stale
4673.98,4677.9, But midway and developer infusion of one key idea on how they want to put a twist on things
4678.86,4684.38, Number three because so many shooters are setting worldward two. We are curious to see what H.O.V. is bringing to the crowded party
4685.42,4691.66, Or four three heroes three destinies one purpose another worldward two game. That was our initial feeling when the opening trailer for midway
4691.66,4693.66, It's upcoming hour of victory started rule
4694.0599999999995,4698.0599999999995, Trailer that feature more worn out cliches than metal of honor called duty and brothers norms combined
4698.219999999999,4701.66," Okay, I'm at number four so I can start to talk about cliches. Okay"
4703.42,4705.0199999999995, Few people number five
4705.0199999999995,4707.98, Few people think that there are too many worldward two games these days
4708.139999999999,4712.139999999999," In fact, this genre is seen a glut of games lately many of which suffer from the same problems"
4713.1,4719.820000000001, Number six we are surprised is you that a worldward two game can still impress us this much considering how many others we've seen in the past few years
4719.9800000000005,4721.9800000000005, This game blew away the competition
4722.3,4723.58, Number seven
4723.58,4728.780000000001," By this time and again, these are all from the first paragraphs of each of these stories right so you're in"
4730.3,4732.3, God damn
4732.3,4738.14," Okay, by this time we've all had our Phil storming beaches at Normandy and we chase for almost across the African desert countless times"
4738.780000000001,4743.58, This bird I asked the folks at EA what makes them think another worldward two shooter can make the last great war great to play again
4743.58,4746.780000000001, They they just smiled set and set me in front of middle of honor airborne
4747.18,4748.700000000001, So
4748.700000000001,4754.700000000001, Aside from the fact that like let's talk about countless time if anything's happening countless times or if any cliches are being
4755.660000000001,4757.660000000001, We shade the death
4757.660000000001,4761.900000000001, This this damn intro let's get over it. Let's stop as writers. We don't say
4761.900000000001,4766.54," You know ourselves for five years ago, but yeah, I've been say I probably said it on the podcast million times"
4766.86,4771.1," I know no one's listening, but whatever I had to I have to it's one of those things working on such a pet pee"
4771.1,4772.62, I got to get out and yell at it
4772.62,4776.94, But the part about it that is the stupidest thing to me is this sense where it's like
4777.58,4780.3," They're on a as seen on TV commercial, you know"
4781.74,4785.74, And they're like they're getting tired of it. You know I'm tired of like a Steve or whatever
4785.74,4789.18, I'm tired of taking crabs. I'm gonna pierce my butt shake together whatever
4790.86,4795.18," This is like I'm tired of worldward two games, but it's always like there's always light at the end of the tunnel"
4795.26,4801.02, And this game ever came the right about that moment is so so that's where the info where she'll think comes on
4801.02,4808.3," Yeah, they're just like I was so jaded so skeptical, but oh Lord they showed me this and it's all like all that's kind of the window"
4809.02,4813.26, Are you played 20 world-guard two games before but you like that
4814.780000000001,4821.34, It's like a call present. Why waste time with all that skepticism even though that if you get that skepticism is so ubiquitous
4821.34,4825.72," It doesn't need stating that don't state it, but it's like then but you're so easily easily"
4825.72,4830.06, Fake way to believe that this is the one yeah you're pretending to be skeptical
4830.06,4832.06," Yeah, just as a way to do your lead"
4832.06,4835.58, You're so easily convinced that this next like like for me it's like it's whatever
4835.58,4837.74, I don't like you don't make a big deal and talk about like
4838.46,4840.22, God damn it. This is the
4840.22,4846.06," 26th fantasy game with swords and dragons in it. I've seen this in the past five years, you know"
4846.06,4849.34," Right, but these guys have got a new twist on they got diamond swords"
4850.14,4855.42, Amit this dragons and then the thing is you you reap you do that back at the end then till you bring it back
4855.42,4858.54," And then you say you know, but it remains to be seen"
4859.82,4863.42, Half hour of play work convinced that frame rates aside
4864.9400000000005,4870.54, This could be frame rates crappy AI control issues are so this case like yeah
4870.54,4874.22, Point notice I mean people can point out I'm sure we do we do plenty of things that bug people
4874.22,4878.14, But just like you said you said no that is the right around website as well
4878.3,4882.3, And we have it some yeah one of those that I read or maybe two of more from our own website
4882.3,4886.14, So it's like if it's just to the writers it's so easy to do to do something
4886.14,4888.54, And if you're a reader demand more demand something better
4889.34,4893.58," You know, man just not for much yeah, not subscribe to GF"
4896.06,4900.700000000001," Okay, okay, so we take it home Jeff I'm taking a sum"
4901.34,4904.06, We're re-loading the bond one last time as we go
