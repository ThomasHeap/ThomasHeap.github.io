0.0,8.0," Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. Yes, we are back. We're here. We're going to record and we're actually going to post it today."
8.0,13.0, I promise it's going to happen. It's going to happen or we're going to shoot Ryan.
13.0,17.0," What the hell? It's is, uh, it's not the first time you've threatened that."
17.0,20.0," No, that's sure I did it in our very first ad."
20.0,28.0," And we got a hate mail from somebody from somebody because they posted that ad on like, uh, on some other ziff Davis podcast."
28.0,31.0," It wasn't like the game group, like some tech podcast."
31.0,37.0, And then I got some like angry email that was forward at some dude wrote like the CEO of Ziff Davis.
37.0,43.0," I don't find it amusing that one editor threatened another, either with violence."
43.0,46.0, What kind of company are you running there?
46.0,48.0," Well, all this."
48.0,52.0, And so our promo some dude here at on those podcast.
52.0,59.0," And yeah, this is a deaf green. It's November 13th, 2007."
59.0,65.0," I'm here with some of the editors of Games, Swindows, the official magazine and they are."
65.0,67.0," Ryan Scott, not shot yet."
67.0,70.0," Sean, Malay, hostless Timon, the living."
70.0,72.0," Sean Elliott, but you go on."
72.0,74.0," I said, I got a phone call to make."
74.0,77.0, I'll see if this works.
77.0,80.0, Sorry. This is business.
81.0,83.0, Thank you for calling.
83.0,85.0, If you do not have a loan with cash.
85.0,87.0," Please, press."
87.0,89.0, This call may be longer than a cover code.
89.0,90.0, It's so cloudy.
90.0,91.0, Sorry.
97.0,99.0, They better pick up quick.
99.0,101.0, I don't know time for this.
101.0,103.0, Thank you for calling cash call.
103.0,104.0, Which is can't.
104.0,106.0," Hey, is this cash call?"
107.0,111.0," I had, I called for $217 on the previous cash call."
111.0,121.0, And I wanted to know if I could make this cash call for the $217 to pay back my other cash call.
121.0,123.0, We might.
123.0,124.0, Cash call.
124.0,126.0, We'll like to go and come to me.
126.0,128.0," I know, but I called like it's cash call."
128.0,131.0," So every time I call in my mind, it's a cash call."
131.0,134.0, So I know there's the cash call to company and there's meat calling for cash.
134.0,136.0, So I called for cash.
136.0,141.0," And I borrowed that money, but now I want to borrow more money to pay back the other cash call."
141.0,143.0, What's your money?
143.0,148.0," Um, I don't, well, first of what's the APR again?"
148.0,151.0, Do you want to apply or you already have a loan with that?
151.0,152.0, I have one.
152.0,154.0, I want another one to pay the other one off.
154.0,156.0, But I want to know the APR.
156.0,158.0, Okay.
158.0,161.0," Well, if you have an existing loan, you have to pay that one off."
162.0,167.0, But that's what the new loan is for to pay off the other cash call.
167.0,173.0," If you have a loan with that, you have to pay it off this is very before you take a new loan."
173.0,177.0, Okay. What's the APR on the other one I have?
177.0,179.0, I want to know what's the yellow one I need upper.
179.0,180.0, Isn't it?
180.0,184.0, Because I think they said it was like 99.25%.
184.0,186.0, I get it.
186.0,188.0, I know because I don't have anything about you.
189.0,191.0," I just, I know, but I just, well, here's something about me."
191.0,195.0, I want to round the 99.25% up to a cool 100%.
195.0,197.0, If that's possible.
197.0,198.0, Okay.
198.0,200.0," Well, again, I'm not sure what you're speaking of."
200.0,202.0, You want to take a new loan.
202.0,203.0, I call for cash.
203.0,204.0, I gotta go.
204.0,205.0, I gotta go.
205.0,206.0, I need cash.
206.0,207.0, I hate that number.
207.0,209.0, I hate that phone number.
209.0,210.0, Wow.
210.0,211.0, Sorry.
211.0,212.0, Cash.
212.0,213.0, Okay.
213.0,215.0, That's how you would be helpful.
216.0,218.0, This is very important.
218.0,219.0, I don't know if you're on a prank.
219.0,221.0, You're not really helpful at all.
221.0,222.0, You're not helpful.
222.0,223.0, Yeah.
223.0,225.0," So you haven't, like, count with these people?"
225.0,226.0, No.
226.0,228.0, That's the one Gary Coleman on the TV.
228.0,230.0, Talking about how his family won't give him no money.
230.0,231.0, So we called Cash.
231.0,233.0," Well, for Cash, called then."
233.0,235.0," It's like, it's like only 99.25%."
235.0,236.0, If you are.
236.0,238.0, All right.
238.0,240.0, So we gotta show.
240.0,243.0," That guy, that guy over there is on the other end."
243.0,246.0," Man, some moron just called."
246.0,248.0," I was hoping he wouldn't, you know,"
248.0,250.0, it's just going to try to go for infinite regress.
250.0,252.0," So I was like, okay, well, we could set you up for that."
252.0,255.0," And I just like, well, can I make a cash call to pay off the one I just made?"
255.0,258.0," But if I call you right back, can I pay that one on?"
258.0,260.0, I just ordered.
260.0,261.0," Oh, yes."
261.0,262.0, It did not happen.
262.0,266.0, So I got one little thing unrelated to anything that's bothering me right now.
266.0,268.0, Which is it right before we came in here?
268.0,270.0, All of EGM was in here.
270.0,272.0," And there were like a lot of them for one thing,"
272.0,273.0, which pissed me off.
273.0,275.0," They're stassel, I pay them."
275.0,277.0," But they were like, they were all eaten together."
277.0,278.0, And they were loud.
278.0,280.0," And they were like, it was like a college party."
280.0,282.0, You're like throwing food and laughing.
282.0,283.0, You're having fun together.
283.0,284.0, They're having fun together.
284.0,285.0, What the fuck's up with that?
285.0,286.0, Why don't we don't do that?
286.0,288.0," We're all just like, that's, we eat it our deaths."
288.0,289.0," Like, don't even talk to each other."
289.0,291.0," When I first joined EGM every day,"
291.0,294.0, we would all go to lunch somewhere and we eat lunch out together.
294.0,295.0, Yeah.
295.0,296.0," And then that gradually transitioned into,"
296.0,300.0, we all get it and bring a back and eat in the conference room here together.
300.0,303.0," And then when I switched to GFW, CGW,"
303.0,305.0," it's like, sometimes we all go to lunch."
305.0,306.0, We all go downstairs together.
306.0,308.0, We all say we want something else.
308.0,310.0, And then we go back to our deaths and eat it.
310.0,312.0, And we're all just sitting at our death by ourselves.
312.0,314.0," That's a, that's a PC gaming thing."
314.0,315.0, I'm busy.
315.0,316.0, It is.
316.0,317.0," We can't, we can't socialize together."
317.0,320.0," To say it is, I think, you know, like in grad school when I was like playing a hard"
320.0,324.0," quarter team for just classic with some, some fellow grad students and teachers."
324.0,328.0, We'd go out to dinner and have drinks or something at some point.
328.0,330.0, We start talking about team four just so much.
330.0,332.0," We'd all like, let's all go home and play."
332.0,336.0," So like, let's all go, let's all split apart so we can come back together and play"
336.0,337.0, this game.
337.0,338.0, Right.
338.0,339.0, Right.
339.0,340.0, That seems so right.
340.0,342.0," See, the console gamers, they all like sit there together and they hang out"
342.0,344.0, just like console gamers do with their games.
344.0,347.0, And we all go back to our separate PCs and just sit behind our monitors.
347.0,349.0," Quiet, we eating our sandwiches."
349.0,350.0, It's not socializing.
350.0,351.0, It's sad.
351.0,353.0, I think they need to do something about that.
353.0,356.0," Because a lot of times you know, you have friends over instead of just like,"
356.0,357.0, let's watch TV.
357.0,359.0, There's so many good things on the internet that we were going to be
359.0,360.0, ready to watch together.
360.0,363.0, Just going to all huddle around the monitor.
363.0,369.0," They need to, I want like some broke ass theater local area to just like run the latest in"
369.0,371.0, internet content.
371.0,372.0, Like everyone just goes.
372.0,373.0," They like, like YouTube videos."
373.0,374.0, They serve drinks and shit.
374.0,378.0," Yeah, and it's maybe like five bucks and they just show, but that's the thing is like they have different"
378.0,379.0, hosts.
379.0,384.0," And then they're known for their ability to come up with some like, like, truly good stuff that you have in already seen."
384.0,387.0," So like, you know, Wednesday nights would be like whatever."
387.0,388.0, Don't you think of the teaser?
388.0,393.0, It's going to be a TV show that's going to be like America's best YouTube videos or something.
393.0,395.0, There are these and that's where they go to die.
395.0,397.0, That's where internet memes go to die on the webjoins.
397.0,399.0," So they have like, digital biking on their noun."
399.0,401.0," Next month though, I've taken a Viking year."
401.0,402.0, Yeah.
402.0,403.0, They're not the guy.
403.0,405.0, I look at this crazy German.
405.0,406.0, Uh-huh.
406.0,407.0, He's dancing.
407.0,408.0, I still worship him though.
408.0,409.0, The technique.
409.0,411.0, Taking even if the meme is dead.
411.0,412.0, I hate him already.
412.0,413.0, Okay.
413.0,415.8, So one other thing that that happened when I got into the sermon right before I came into the
415.8,421.0," sermon was I found out from some anonymous person who were, except if Davis on the, like,"
421.0,429.36," financial corporate side that that every single week, this person gets totally pissed off at the sports"
429.36,435.6, anomaly podcast because they're in here and they're so loud apparently that she's got a closer
435.6,441.0, door and put on her headphones to not hear these guys podcasting.
441.0,442.0, And she could still hear them.
442.0,443.0, I can't.
443.0,447.0, So you got this old loud a podcast.
447.0,450.0, What do we do here now to piss her off now?
450.0,451.0, What would I have to do?
451.0,452.0, How many times?
452.0,453.0," God damn it, God."
453.0,454.0, There is.
454.0,459.0, How many times have people come by the door and look in when I'm doing a here or the web or something
459.0,460.0, and give us the stink guy?
460.0,461.0, We've got the eye.
461.0,462.0," Oh, we have got the eye a little bit."
462.0,464.0, So we're in the other studio.
464.0,466.0, This one can be a different person around us.
466.0,467.0, There's a big black curtain so we can't.
467.0,468.0, That's she.
468.0,469.0, Anyone looking.
469.0,470.0, Downstairs.
470.0,471.0, They used to do it though.
471.0,472.0, Which aquarium.
472.0,477.0," But one time remember, we were recording one of the rap intros or like one of the reading intros"
477.0,478.0, and the guy comes in.
478.0,480.0, Is this going to be going on long?
480.0,482.0, And then you like slip right back out before we could even answer.
482.0,483.0, That was downstairs.
483.0,484.0, Yeah.
484.0,485.0, Yeah.
485.0,488.0, But you made it a go on longer by interrupting us.
488.0,489.0, Thanks.
489.0,493.0," I just thought, what do they even have to talk about that so add grow?"
493.0,494.0, Does he need to talk to men?
494.0,495.0, Yeah.
495.0,496.0, What does that?
496.0,497.0, Like the sport.
497.0,498.0, I like sports.
498.0,499.0, I do.
499.0,500.0, That's the thing today.
500.0,501.0, You got to get aggro about everything.
501.0,503.0, Doesn't matter how a relevant or piss an it is.
503.0,507.0, It's got to become something worth laying your life on the line for.
507.0,508.0, Who made this place to have?
508.0,509.0, Review scores.
509.0,510.0, We got a lot.
510.0,511.0, We got a lot.
511.0,512.0, Anything anyone makes.
512.0,514.0, We got a lot to land on.
514.0,516.0," And with that, let's get to it."
516.0,517.0, Did you like that?
517.0,518.0, No.
518.0,519.0, That was hot.
519.0,520.0, So let's.
520.0,521.0, We do have a lot.
521.0,526.0, I wanted to very quickly apologize for the kind of cluster
526.0,528.0, that I'm going on with us podcasting.
528.0,530.0, It's been particularly lousy timing.
530.0,536.0, I assure you it's been lousy timing for us as well because we have had a lot to talk about with all the great.
536.0,540.0, Great and exciting new PC releases that we haven't been able to talk about on this podcast.
540.0,542.0, So now today we've got a ton of them.
542.0,545.0, I hope we can get through them all.
545.0,548.0, Start called duty four modern warfare.
548.0,549.0, Pick some places start.
549.0,550.0, That's good.
550.0,551.0, Call duty four.
551.0,552.0, Yeah.
552.0,553.0, How many of us have played that?
553.0,555.0, Find PC game.
555.0,556.0, I'm looking at me and Ryan.
556.0,557.0, Sean.
557.0,558.0, Ryan.
558.0,559.0, Ryan.
559.0,561.0, I do have both of us have played it.
561.0,562.0," You finished it too now, right?"
562.0,563.0, I have finished a single player.
563.0,567.0, I have not played any multiplayer since the I was on the beta on the 360.
567.0,569.0, But I played this single player on the PC.
569.0,573.0, I've been playing the multiplayer nightly in the play the single player.
573.0,574.0, Mess around with quite a bit.
574.0,576.0, Play some of the levels of second time.
576.0,581.0," And yeah, that caused the that caused the stink on the posted on forum."
581.0,583.0, About it before we got to talk about it.
583.0,584.0," Oh, shit."
584.0,585.0, That's right.
585.0,586.0, It did.
586.0,587.0, So it's something to do.
587.0,588.0, What did you say exactly?
588.0,589.0," Well, what I was complaining about."
589.0,590.0, Here's the thing.
590.0,593.0, It's like so now we're going to talk about the bigger picture in the game.
593.0,598.0, But somehow in the context that came up.
598.0,602.0," It was just about, you know, the degree that the game immerses you in the experience that's"
602.0,606.0, creating and the combat and stuff.
606.0,608.0, So the spawn system came up.
609.0,615.0," And that's basically where in the game enemies, you know, appear somewhere in the world where your view of them is"
615.0,617.0," occluded by an obstacle, you know, wall or something."
617.0,619.0, They're in a house oftentimes.
619.0,624.0," And they'll continue to, you know, repopulate the world from the same spot over and over again."
624.0,627.0," And what happens is that, you know, not only do they do that."
627.0,633.0, But they post up to one sometimes to specific locations where.
633.0,637.0," Since they're doing this and if they're doing it long enough, you see just this huge pile of body"
637.0,642.0," stacking up at the same corner where they're all, you know, running to when you know the weight form and you even get a sense."
642.0,643.0, I almost had to sense it.
643.0,647.0, Times where we could say this is the order it's going to happen in.
647.0,648.0, That one guy's going to spawn.
648.0,649.0, He's going to go to this window.
649.0,651.0, This guy's going to spawn and go down to it.
651.0,653.0, So it was almost like a plain point blank or something.
653.0,654.0," That's that, you know, really fun."
654.0,656.0, Namco like on shooter.
656.0,659.0, And so that specific comment.
659.0,661.0," It is important, but it's not everything."
661.0,666.0," I mean, one thing that happened was the hotter not mentality that you get, you know,"
666.0,671.0, with games and message boards and that's if you have something negative to say that means.
671.0,677.0, Or just one even one critical comment that that means that the entire that the game is entirety is horrible.
677.0,678.0, You don't like it.
678.0,680.0, You can't recommend it to anyone.
680.0,681.0, Revise verse.
681.0,682.0," You know, if you say something great about it, I mean,"
682.0,684.0," Oh, you love everything about it."
684.0,686.0," Which kind of happened with crisis too and that you know,"
686.0,690.0, I was talking about it on the the one up show last week and I didn't have the chance to.
690.0,693.0, It wasn't able because of embargoes talk about the last section of the game.
693.0,697.0," So it kind of seems shocking when the review actually went up and they saw that well,"
697.0,701.0, my perspective on the last part of the game is kind of it odds with the first one.
701.0,706.0," So, so to get like called duty for I told us that the internet's denison straight."
706.0,708.0, I totally like it.
708.0,711.0, And there's just like I think it's a great game.
711.0,713.0, It's not the best single player game I've ever played.
713.0,716.0," I mean, I think even more, you know, right right now I'm playing."
716.0,718.0, Area 50 one black site came out today too.
718.0,722.0, That's another game where clearly called duty is of certain things.
722.0,727.0, It's a certain sub-genre of shooter and that would be just like super linear.
727.0,732.0," Not only, you know, logistically, you know, which would be, you know, the vehicles and all the things you can do to get around the level."
732.0,738.0," But, so the level spacing is pretty small, you know, the acreage is pretty finite."
738.0,741.0, The things that the enemies do are always the same.
741.0,744.0," Ever, you know, all the stuff is very, very prepared for you."
744.0,750.0," So in that sort of a game, it shows you that they really know how to do it well."
750.0,755.0," And when you compare it to, you know, I've only played like the first, you know, level or so, very 51."
755.0,765.0," But when you go from called duty for to that, you like, wow, you can, you can do this sort of like hyper structured stage play that called duty and the finity work make, and you can do it really well."
765.0,768.0, And then this is what happens when you don't do it well.
768.0,774.0," When you, where it's just ridiculous, I mean, you feel like, shh, shh, shh, on your watching me, there's the, the very first level in Area 51."
774.0,777.0," You get in the Jeep, and of course you just get on the gun."
777.0,780.0," You drive in the Jeep or anything, and you just shoot it things and the Jeep drives around."
780.0,783.0, This is also something that was a tradition in the other called duty games.
783.0,786.0, There's a level like it called duty for here.
786.0,788.0," Here then tends to, it was just so low."
788.0,794.0," You're just driving around this awkward duck, and then you come up upon guys and they're sitting behind a bunch of explosive barrels."
794.0,796.0," So you shoot the barrel, they blow up."
796.0,801.0," And as I was playing it, I was doing kind of like, like, turn table listen stuff."
801.0,806.0," You guys like compete in the DMC, like they start throwing in body tricks into into their performance."
806.0,809.0, Because it's like not just enough to like juggle a couple records.
809.0,813.0," So you can like do a spin right, and then you hit like the cross fader with your butt cheek."
813.0,815.0," So I was like, do that all the time."
815.0,818.0," I was like, I had like one hand on the mouse, you know, it was controlling the gun."
818.0,821.0," And I was like, I would see some dudes, and it was a barrel, and I'd be like,"
821.0,825.0," Bitches and blow them up, do a spin, come back, grab the controller, turn around."
825.0,826.0, There's some more guys.
826.0,827.0," Oh, I'm pretty impressed with it."
827.0,830.0," So that's how, well, with that was like, it was just totally boring."
830.0,835.0," This is so completely boring that it's like, and it's funny."
835.0,839.0," Of course, the game's called, and again, now I'm talking about one level of air if it"
839.0,846.0," Do want. So don't, this isn't a review of air if it do want it, but it's a critical commentary on the first level, which was utter shit."
846.0,853.0," It's like, oh, it's very much like, what was this for my me if Ryan's like, dude, this is like air if 51."
854.0,861.0," You meant you'll want in the tavern, you know, where there's like a cigarette burns and shit all over the gun over the plastic guys."
861.0,863.0," Yeah, there's like that."
863.0,869.0," But so what Call Duty Ford does in my opinion, that makes it work is that they understand,"
869.0,878.0," Well, they understand also that they're game because it's so intense because the sound is so spot on in the feedback that you get from firing the weapons"
878.0,891.0," and just the creating the illusion of just like, just combat turned up to 11, you know, shell-shocking all this that they can't, that they're going to fatigue you if they just give you that from start to finish for six hours or whatever"
891.0,899.0," That's just going to drive you nuts, right? I mean, anyone, you after a while you like, god damn it, I got to take a break, you know, that's why they're rounds in between, you know, boxing matches and stuff."
899.0,903.0," I mean, they're, they're, whether rather matches divide in to rounds."
903.0,914.0," And so, and then they take this other thing that they've always done is, and that's jumping from theater to theater, you know, the world or two cases, you might be on the Soviet side, you might be with Brits, you might be American."
914.0,924.0," And it's kind of been like this arbitrary jump there, arbitrary, you know, not so much into far as it like all these, these nation's and people and people from these nation's fought in the war,"
924.0,928.0, but it wasn't like they'd ever communicated with one another or new one another.
929.0,955.0," So here they take the same theme and then they find a way to make it make sense. So that you still have love at a level variety with tones or different, you know, degrees of, you know, collar used saturation and different, actual things you do. They find ways to, you know, see at the sniper missions and stuff, you have the, I know we're going to want to talk about it. The AC 130, yeah, sort of death from above mission. What did they call that?"
955.0,968.0," The name of the mission. Yeah, I forget the things I can't remember. But, but so, and all those things do help the game, I mean, in the same way that prays pacing in half life series, you know, it helps, it keeps things fresh throughout."
968.0,978.0," But what happens in the reason it was a point and the reason I wanted it to make an issue of the combat thing is that at the same time, you have these phenomenal graphics, the game's gorgeous."
978.0,988.0," And I think even more so when you go to, you know, the UAE 3 engine based, every 501 and everything just looks like 10 foil and everything's already looking toadry."
988.0,996.0," Something else there too, another sideline observation is that, you know, every time there's new generation of hardware that comes out and new, you know, new engines and stuff."
996.0,1007.0," And at first even mediocre games technically mediocre games like look stunning. So there's that phase where you're like, I tend to, during the beginning of a system's life or for PC when the, there's new card upgrade or whatever."
1007.0,1015.0, Or some new engine like 103. I'm more willing to play games that I know and I've been warned or pretty mediocre experiences because they look cool.
1015.0,1024.0," Because they look really cool. And I think for me, area 51 is the game that made you, we put the, put the end on that phase for UAE 3 for that."
1024.0,1032.0," That soon, where he's like, wow, it's just, it's just not that very 51 that combined with the release of crisis and call duty force."
1032.0,1041.0," So, called duty for, it has, you know, limitations and stuff, but it, it does, it, it, it, it, the stuff looks great. It looks really natural, everything."
1041.0,1048.0," So now you have that and you have this, you have all these ingredients to make something that's going to put you in this combat scenario that they're creating."
1048.0,1054.0," But then what happens for me is that a bunch of enemies come out when I'm fighting down a street or something, right?"
1054.0,1059.0," My natural psychological instinct is not, let's run full speed into these guys."
1059.0,1065.0," And the game actually discourages you from doing that on the level because they'll rip you up instantly, right? And you'll die."
1065.0,1075.0," Right. So then you stop, you take some cover, you see your other guys providing the visual cue telling you guys in your squad or that you're working with, say, hey, let's stop here."
1075.0,1092.0," You'll, thin these guys out and then we'll try to move forward. Right. So what happens when you do that and it's, again, like, I don't think this is a case of like me playing a game to break a game or playing it like at the extreme limits to see what I'm able to get away with or to sort of like figure out what its limitations are."
1092.0,1099.0," It's just just a very natural, like I first noticed it because I'm like doing just that. Hey, ton of guys stop shoot these guys and move on."
1099.0,1119.0," So as I said there, then they start, they kept coming back out. And then I was like, I stopped thinking about, oh, God, this is crazy. I feel like I'm in some approximation of combat zone to thinking about the system, thinking about the structure and the way and the, the artifice that makes all this stuff possible, right?"
1119.0,1134.0," And I don't think you want to do that because you want to be like I'm saying you want to be in the shit or whatever, you know, and instead, I was like, okay, here's this guy here he comes again. So you just keep shooting them and it's not stopped and eventually figure out, oh, it shuts it off when I go up next to it."
1135.0,1147.0," That's the problem is that the game doesn't offer that kind of it's missing that sort of like if they want to have responding enemies into building, okay, that's one thing, but they needed to have one more little sort of clue or something in there."
1147.0,1163.0," So that it didn't, it didn't break that illusion, you know, they needed to have to give me something to move forward to have you move forward other than the fact that if I don't move forward, they're going to keep responding, right, you know, I mean, because yeah, and if you do sit there and wait, it gets ludicrous because you'll see that."
1163.0,1168.0," Because you'll see them coming out of like one little shack, it starts looking like a cartoon or a clown."
1168.0,1183.0," Yeah, you know, there's like 50 dudes in one like, and they go to the same spot every time and that's important too, you know, so yeah, you were like, okay, and then yeah, you turn up, you know, you turn up the body count to, so you, you know, because it's one of the settings."
1183.0,1195.0," You know, you see, like in same body counts, you keep them in the world after where you go in and there's like, it's like a channel house in front of the like stack of sandbags because the guys just kept doing it, you know."
1195.0,1204.0," I do agree with you about in general about the variety of the levels, I mean, I thought, I thought it was a great game, you know, I was, oh, I'm rattling sure."
1204.0,1213.0," I thought it was, you know, it was one of the first shooters in a while that I wanted to play all the way through just because I wanted to play it."
1213.0,1219.0," I wasn't writing about it or whatever, but but every single mission was so fun and was so varied."
1219.0,1227.0," That it kept me going forward. The pacing is fantastic and called duty four and you know, it's of course, it's like very manipulative."
1227.0,1237.0," It's very much like you said it's it's very linear. It's a Disneyland ride. They're they're kind of throwing one little like trick and novelty yet you after another, but they're basically really good ones."
1237.0,1240.0, Like I I felt very much along for this ride.
1240.0,1241.0, Right.
1241.0,1245.0, And I felt the same way. There were times when maybe.
1245.0,1256.0," I don't know. I felt like again, like say they they're the playwrights there, you know, it was responsible for the sets and there's always other actors and my lines are very much prepared for me."
1256.0,1259.0, And you have to do exactly that.
1259.0,1267.0, Sometimes they don't provide that script for you to read to and they'll punish you for maybe like getting your lines wrong to an extent that's a little bit arbitrary.
1267.0,1281.0," You shouldn't go on over here, so I'm going to blow up a car. So you stop you or say for example, you know, like I ended up I know a lot of people some parts I was able to do in a single pass that other people told me they had to do multiple times on for me."
1281.0,1291.0," For me, the very part where you lay down in the field and the tank the BMPs, you know, armored vehicles and troopers walk through in your sniper and you lay there."
1291.0,1299.0," I had to do that over and over again to the point that by the time I finally finished it, it was nothing but okay, here's I no longer saw anything."
1299.0,1308.0, I no longer saw it as I'm hiding in a field and there's people looking for me like I'm playing this game. It could be dots. I could just be seeing cases like some sort of vector graphics and right.
1309.0,1317.0," This is exactly how I have to do it. This is the only way it's going to work and that took me about three tries, but when I got it on the third try."
1317.0,1322.0, I was so relieved because I was getting the sinking feeling in my head that it was going to take me forever.
1322.0,1333.0," But that level was I mean, I experienced some of the frustration that one, but again that was one of those ones that I thought like, wow, this is actually something I've never done before like this is very clever."
1333.0,1337.0, That it's having laying down in the grass while these guys are sweeping over you.
1337.0,1344.0, Like it's because you never made it past the first room full of crates in that one year or played splitter cell.
1344.0,1346.0," No, no, I played splitter cell."
1346.0,1347.0, But I just you're right.
1347.0,1349.0, Like as a crate and it'll get.
1349.0,1354.0," Yeah, no, I didn't get I didn't get past you could walk as a crate."
1354.0,1360.0," But every I mean, but that that was the thing about called duties that it inspires all those different emotions."
1360.0,1364.0," You know, in that particular one, it's like the tenseness of I don't want these guys to see me."
1364.0,1372.0," Right. You know, the other one that that you alluded to that was just I thought was just freaking brilliant is the the gunship one."
1372.0,1384.0," Right. I always get the name run because it was crazy how well that section resonated with people just you know, go and listening to friends and reading posts again online because everyone sing that out is like, wow, this was crazy."
1384.0,1389.0," And then I went to you and I was like, wait a minute and I got I was like, you don't know what this is from right."
1389.0,1393.0, I didn't and so I sent you some links that were in the evening and it creeped me out even more.
1393.0,1403.0," I mean, if for people who who don't know, there's this one level in the game where you are what you do the on going to say is it's just plain and you got like stuff to shoot."
1403.0,1408.0, So what's actually the three gunship also known just cut name spooky.
1408.0,1411.0, It was used in the Vietnam war.
1412.0,1414.0, We're getting much an area.
1414.0,1415.0, That's much.
1415.0,1417.0," No, it's it's very much."
1417.0,1419.0, This is a very much.
1419.0,1422.0, Wargasm.
1422.0,1428.0," But yeah, it's basically an aircraft that flies, you know, real to be high altitude above."
1428.0,1433.0," A battlefield or might not be a battlefield in this case could be, you know,"
1433.0,1434.0, Exactly like isolated.
1434.0,1436.0, It's a city skate.
1436.0,1441.0," It's quite a few big guns on it and has, you know, if a red and all sorts of other, you know,"
1441.0,1448.0, high-tech tracking abilities and basically what happens is they the interface naturally from the weapon systems on the AC 130.
1448.0,1450.0, Are you very video game like?
1450.0,1457.0," Yeah, and I think to the point in general that when you have, you know, sort of intelligent discussions about, you know, combat and stuff, you know, contemporary combat."
1457.0,1461.0," People worry about the levels of because before, you know,"
1461.0,1463.0, originally you had people you punch each other.
1463.0,1464.0, Then you hit each other with rocks.
1464.0,1465.0, Then you hit each other with swords.
1465.0,1468.0," And there's always this, you're very aware of what you're doing."
1468.0,1474.0," And then when, you know, rifles and stuff come into play and arrows, then there's this other layer of abstraction where I'm pulling a trigger."
1474.0,1477.0," I'm not actually, you know, you have to get gross, but we're talking about gross stuff."
1477.0,1481.0," This is a game that's basically about murder, you know, not murder actually killing."
1481.0,1486.0," Depending on the, maybe their, the game might depict a few things that could qualify as murder in a court."
1486.0,1488.0," But, um, so."
1488.0,1492.0," And then you get to this point where, yeah, you're looking at a screen and black and white."
1492.0,1494.0, And you see these little things moving around.
1494.0,1497.0, It's a little thought to degree that abstraction is very video game like right.
1497.0,1502.0," And you pull a trigger, you aim across hair and they disappear."
1502.0,1504.0," You just, you have puff of smoke right."
1504.0,1507.0," And then so what they've done, I mean, that's interesting is they've taken."
1507.0,1514.0, War as it's beginning to resemble video games and then made a video game about war to resemble.
1514.0,1518.0," War that's like a video game, you know, and it's got this cool vibe to it."
1518.0,1521.0," But then because of that, because it's so minimal because the actual, you know,"
1521.0,1526.0," point of view for people in those situations is so stark like that, like this could be real."
1526.0,1530.0," And then what they got and it was so important was that instead of,"
1530.0,1534.0," Yeah, they have, there are a few moments when the guys that are in the plane,"
1534.0,1538.0," you know, the spotters, pilots and other people crew of the ship will say,"
1538.0,1541.0," you like, you know, boom or something like you boom."
1541.0,1546.0," But if you, you know, if you watch the videos of these things that are recorded from actual missions,"
1546.0,1549.0," there's this eerie sort of clinical,"
1549.0,1553.0," yes, like lead and by another four feet, you know, you'll hear, you'll hear like, you know,"
1553.0,1557.0," Apache videos and stuff too. You'll hear pilots talking to the gunners and saying,"
1557.0,1560.0," okay, you got it. Okay. It was like, that's a kill two more feet forward."
1560.0,1562.0," Right. Right. And again, he's still moving. Right."
1562.0,1566.0," And it's just this very, so what happens is when you play it, you're like,"
1566.0,1568.0," it's just, it makes you think about these."
1568.0,1570.0," That's exactly what happened to me. And like you said,"
1570.0,1574.0," I hadn't seen the YouTube videos yet. So I didn't know that it was based on reality,"
1574.0,1577.0," but you know, you get behind the scone, the screen turns black and white,"
1577.0,1580.0," because that's what you know, you're looking through the scope of the gun."
1580.0,1583.0," And they have you, you know, picking off these people down below."
1583.0,1589.0," And it was, it's such, it's such a freaky disconnect that like I had never experienced before."
1589.0,1592.0," I mean, I've shot plenty of guns and video games over the years,"
1592.0,1596.0," but it's always like, you know, with guys falling down."
1596.0,1598.0, But here you're way the hell up.
1598.0,1600.0," You don't, they can't see you."
1600.0,1603.0, They can't see you. You don't see the bullets. You just see a puff of smoke.
1603.0,1606.0," And then it's, it's exactly what you said. It's the eerieness of the,"
1606.0,1612.0, the clinicalness and the complete mundane tone of the guy that are sitting on the plane with you.
1612.0,1614.0," That's the only sound you hear in that level. And they're just like,"
1614.0,1616.0, move over to a feet.
1616.0,1618.0," If you got him, that's a kill."
1618.0,1621.0," And as you keep doing it, it's just really creepy."
1621.0,1623.0," Right. I mean, it really freaked me out."
1623.0,1626.0," You know, and then when I, when I actually saw the YouTube,"
1626.0,1629.0, that's exactly what it was like in real life.
1629.0,1633.0," But part of the reason I showed you the YouTube video, and it's difficult to watch,"
1633.0,1635.0," and we keep saying YouTube. I mean, these, like,"
1635.0,1637.0," if anyone is really interested in this sort of stuff,"
1637.0,1641.0, go to like militaryvideos.net and see everything you need to see.
1641.0,1645.0," But uh, is that when you see it,"
1645.0,1648.0," I was, I was trying to make a point that, okay,"
1648.0,1652.0," we're all of our, a normally functioning mind is like,"
1652.0,1654.0, just absolutely capable of differentiating.
1654.0,1657.0," Like, they're, like, we're still resonating with us."
1657.0,1660.0," We're like, oh, I see why this is like kind of weird."
1660.0,1662.0," You know, this is kind of, it makes me feel something."
1662.0,1665.0," But like, okay, watch the real thing and tell me what happens."
1665.0,1667.0," And then I was like, I know two minutes into it."
1667.0,1669.0, I know you probably had to not in your stomach.
1669.0,1672.0," I mean, you're feeling like, yeah, I mean,"
1672.0,1676.0," you're, we're just capable of differentiating that, okay,"
1676.0,1680.0," this is real, and they were lives lost, no matter how abstracted it appears."
1680.0,1683.0," You know, through the, you know, monitoring system."
1683.0,1684.0, You're right.
1684.0,1687.0," And when you're done with that, you're like, it sits with you through the rest of the day."
1687.0,1690.0," I mean, at least for me, I feel so uneasy."
1690.0,1692.0," And it's like, wow, did it, should I have watched that?"
1692.0,1693.0," Yeah, that's right."
1693.0,1696.0," I mean, it did creep me out while I was playing the game."
1696.0,1699.0, And it surprised me because I'd never experienced it in a video game.
1699.0,1700.0, But you're right.
1700.0,1703.0, I still know I was playing a game when I actually watched the real life video.
1703.0,1704.0, Right.
1704.0,1706.0, I made it about three minutes in and I had to turn it off.
1706.0,1707.0," Yeah, exactly."
1707.0,1708.0, Yeah.
1708.0,1711.0, And that's one reason why I can't watch people really killing people this clinically.
1711.0,1713.0," We don't have to fear about,"
1713.0,1715.0," we don't have so much to fear about video games,"
1715.0,1717.0," turning us into thoughtless, you know,"
1717.0,1721.0, people who don't give a shit about about human life and accept for Ryan.
1721.0,1722.0, Right.
1722.0,1723.0, No.
1723.0,1724.0, That's different.
1724.0,1725.0, Always the quiet one.
1725.0,1726.0, Right.
1726.0,1727.0, Not it.
1727.0,1728.0, That's it.
1728.0,1729.0, Yeah.
1729.0,1730.0, Quiet.
1730.0,1731.0, Right.
1731.0,1734.0," So a city single player, another thing that, that,"
1734.0,1737.0, made gave me a different perspective is that I ended up playing it after I played
1737.0,1738.0, crisis.
1738.0,1741.0," And we'll talk about crisis later, but one thing to note there is,"
1741.0,1744.0," you know, we're talking about the stealth and all the way, the ways that these sections work."
1744.0,1749.0," And it's like, in crisis, stealth is also a significant part of the gameplay."
1749.0,1753.0," However, rather than laying still for people to pass and then when they've passed,"
1753.0,1756.0, you continue to go on and they're only going to pass in one direction.
1756.0,1759.0, And they're sort of able to kind of like veer toward you.
1759.0,1762.0," It's funny to manipulate it where you're like, oh, I saw they walked over here."
1762.0,1764.0, I'm just going to go to the far right or something.
1764.0,1766.0," And you see they kind of like somehow managed to turn toward you,"
1766.0,1768.0, even though the path is this way.
1768.0,1770.0, And then go and follow the contours in the path.
1770.0,1775.0," So the difference between like a very specific cat and mouse game with a few people,"
1775.0,1778.0, and it's suggesting that they're looking for you.
1778.0,1784.0," And you're able to play with their perception by say, like, let's throw a stick over here"
1784.0,1787.0, or something like that or let's create some diversion.
1787.0,1792.0, And it's just a much more organic and immersive sort of stealth to me.
1792.0,1795.0," And then when I compared that to like what I said by the point at the end where I was like,"
1795.0,1799.0," it was very clear the dimensions, the very, you know, limited dimensions of that stealth section."
1799.0,1804.0," It was like, yeah, like it's cool, but it's not that cool to me."
1804.0,1807.0," But again, like you're saying, yeah, you know, after that, then you know,"
1807.0,1811.0," you have the segment where you, the person that you're with is injured,"
1811.0,1814.0," you have to carry him, but you also have to set him down to fight, you know,"
1814.0,1821.0," and they just threw the raw, I mean, just the bulk of how many scenarios are."
1821.0,1822.0, Exactly.
1822.0,1827.0," I mean, I think that there's some are hit and miss, but there's so many and they're so varied."
1827.0,1828.0, Exactly.
1828.0,1829.0, Exactly.
1829.0,1832.0, It's like a smartness board of fun little gaming in here.
1832.0,1834.0," Yeah, some of them are dumber than others, right."
1834.0,1841.0, But like I definitely credit them for like really thinking it out and making a fun amusement park of a game there.
1841.0,1842.0," Yeah, totally."
1842.0,1845.0," I've, it's limited and replayed for me for that reason."
1845.0,1850.0," Yeah, and I suspect that over the years it will, we will come and look back at this kind of game."
1850.0,1853.0, This is something a little closer to like a dragon's layer or something.
1853.0,1854.0, And I don't mean that as a song.
1854.0,1855.0, I don't know what you're saying.
1855.0,1859.0," I mean, where, you know, where you're like, because, because immediately, everyone, you say dragons there."
1859.0,1860.0," I've been going to last, right."
1860.0,1862.0, But I love dragons layer when I came out.
1862.0,1864.0," I, I have no idea how much money I spent on it."
1864.0,1873.0," And it's time that was awesome to me, you know, and that doesn't mean just because we've looked at the way we only look at it the way we do now is because of all the things that have happened in the time since then."
1873.0,1881.0," I'm just saying that I think at some point, maybe they'll continue to be like just viable people will do things with them to make them work all along,"
1881.0,1891.0," or we could get to the point where all these other solutions with AI and scenario making and all these things make it become cost effective enough so that people just like, hey, why don't we do that?"
1891.0,1892.0, It's an option.
1892.0,1899.0," Well, there's also nothing wrong with the game being like, you know, a great, a great, great experience that's only great one time."
1899.0,1900.0," Yeah, absolutely."
1900.0,1902.0," Yeah, I agree with that."
1902.0,1905.0," Let's see, most of the games I have, I have never replayed."
1905.0,1906.0, Right.
1906.0,1909.0," I think I could replay. I just, just too much else to go through."
1909.0,1911.0, Right. There's always the next thing.
1911.0,1915.0," And of course, the Half-Life series is very much a game of this sort."
1915.0,1916.0, Definitely.
1916.0,1918.0, People bring that up a lot. There's some differences.
1918.0,1924.0," I think, I think the characterization in Half-Life series is superior and I think that even there,"
1924.0,1932.0," I mean, without even going to the obvious examples, which would be like, you know, maybe the last section in episode two where it does open up more and it's not entirely linear."
1933.0,1942.0," It's not so much that is the fact that you got, you know, the puzzles, the environmental puzzles to solve and all these other sorts of things that go beyond."
1942.0,1944.0, Just the Call of Duty.
1944.0,1945.0," Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot."
1945.0,1946.0, Thank you.
1946.0,1947.0, Yeah.
1947.0,1951.0," Y'all have Alex's ass, which is in the middle of the episode two."
1951.0,1953.0, Last thing on the same player for Call Duty.
1953.0,1954.0, Just saying.
1954.0,1955.0, Yeah.
1955.0,1957.0, What about the story point?
1957.0,1960.0," It was very clear, you know, they were like, okay, there's the Middle East."
1960.0,1964.0," And then you go to some like, you go to very specific locations in Russia."
1964.0,1966.0," And then you have the Middle East, but then the half said."
1966.0,1968.0," But no, they don't."
1968.0,1971.0," I mean, like, I mean, like, if the one is got Iraq, does it?"
1971.0,1973.0," Well, I was thinking of TV. I was thinking of 24."
1973.0,1978.0," The entire last season of 24 was, yeah, everybody goes 24."
1978.0,1980.0," The entire last season, it was your country."
1980.0,1983.0," You know, they never said the country."
1983.0,1984.0, Yeah.
1984.0,1986.0," So, yeah, no, they're not alone in that."
1987.0,1993.0," But the thing that that's curious to me though, and that gives me sort of a feed's feed's"
1993.0,1998.0, conspiracy theory is that they show the map of visual map of where you're at.
1998.0,1999.0, Yeah.
1999.0,2004.0," And it's very clearly Saudi Arabia at all the Red Sea side, which is also where, you know, of course,"
2004.0,2007.0," Becca, it seems like need to not know geography."
2007.0,2009.0," Yeah, I think that's not my hand."
2009.0,2011.0, I was about 10% of the dough.
2011.0,2013.0," No, not recognized that."
2014.0,2018.0," So there it's very clearly, you can clearly understand, right?"
2018.0,2024.0," Then that would mean that the game is depicting a, okay, spoiler time."
2024.0,2028.0," So, I don't know, plug your ears if you're listening to, I know."
2028.0,2031.0," A tactical new going off inside, you know,"
2031.0,2034.0," the,"
2034.0,2040.0," his looms, like, you know, that basically the most important, you know, place no real for, for Muslims."
2040.0,2042.0," And then, I mean, that's controversial stuff."
2042.0,2045.0, And we saw people reacted to some silly Danish cartoons.
2045.0,2048.0, So they don't want to deal with the trouble.
2048.0,2053.0," But the conspiracy thing is that why is the map in there is like maybe someone on the team,"
2053.0,2056.0, or maybe even infinity word wanted to have it.
2056.0,2060.0," And it was maybe the publisher or other that came in at some point,"
2060.0,2062.0," said, no, well, let's just say it's nothing."
2062.0,2066.0," And it makes sense too, because of course, it's, you're having an Islamist revolution"
2066.0,2073.0," in the way that the story goes, it's a, is this resolution in a country where they have a president instead of a king, you know,"
2073.0,2078.0," which is like, this story would not fit Iraq, this story right now would not fit Iran,"
2078.0,2081.0," unless it was taking place, you know, several decades ago,"
2081.0,2083.0," it's like, it's a perfect fit for Saudi Arabia."
2083.0,2084.0," Yeah, just a, just a path."
2084.0,2086.0, I think you just take this shit way too seriously.
2086.0,2088.0," I was just, I was even paying attention."
2088.0,2093.0," So, you guys keep talking and telling me when the cutscenes over, so I can shoot more shit."
2093.0,2098.0," I'd like to count the number of people who are playing this game, we actually know what that Saudi Arabia has, king."
2098.0,2100.0, Right.
2100.0,2105.0," Oh, I thought that had like, yeah, what could play Saudi Arabia on the map right now."
2105.0,2108.0," Yeah, that's, yeah, that's two layers and like, you know what I think."
2108.0,2110.0, So you should try multiple layers on it.
2110.0,2111.0," I mean, you played on Xbox."
2111.0,2113.0," I loved it on Xbox, so yeah."
2113.0,2114.0," And it's the same deal, right?"
2114.0,2116.0, Do you level up and unlock weapons and all that?
2116.0,2118.0, I think it's exactly the same deal.
2118.0,2119.0, It's up.
2119.0,2121.0," You got lean, you know, the option to lean left and right,"
2121.0,2124.0," and just, do I get achievements, though?"
2124.0,2126.0," Um, I need my achievements."
2126.0,2127.0, It has challenges.
2127.0,2128.0," Ah, no, that's not good."
2128.0,2130.0, I got achievements achievements.
2130.0,2132.0," No, no, no, capital A achieve."
2132.0,2133.0," Yeah, really."
2133.0,2134.0," Yeah, I'm not serious."
2134.0,2135.0," No, I'm not serious."
2135.0,2136.0, I don't know.
2136.0,2142.0," But yeah, I mean, it was weird, all of all the talk prior to, you know, because I didn't,"
2142.0,2146.0, I wasn't invited to the Xbox beta for me because you're a hater.
2146.0,2147.0, I'm a hater.
2147.0,2150.0," Yeah, I'm going to be careful what you say about games."
2150.0,2151.0," You're going to be like, sorry."
2151.0,2152.0," You love everything, Sean."
2152.0,2156.0, You'll get more free shit games are serious.
2156.0,2159.0," But no one was like, you know, was like, turned it's,"
2159.0,2162.0," No one just said basically, it's called duty two multiplayer,"
2162.0,2165.0," except almost every weapons, you know,"
2165.0,2170.0, is automatic and can potentially be accurate at any range.
2170.0,2173.0," And then there's air strikes and there's a persistent, you know,"
2173.0,2174.0, ranking thing.
2174.0,2176.0," But I mean, in the shortest sense, if anyone's familiar,"
2176.0,2178.0," if you're a PC gamer, and of course you played, you know,"
2178.0,2179.0, you're not going to be the only one that's really too.
2179.0,2181.0," It's got things to actually feel, but instead of, you know,"
2181.0,2183.0," of the usual set up where you're like, okay,"
2183.0,2185.0, I'm going to check if you're trying to poke your eye on me.
2185.0,2186.0, I don't know what's going on with me today.
2186.0,2187.0, You have a set of me a message.
2187.0,2188.0," No, no."
2188.0,2189.0, I'm sending myself a message.
2189.0,2190.0, Show me.
2190.0,2193.0," So instead of the, the, something that I do miss about COD 2 is that,"
2193.0,2195.0," you know, you have a bolt action rifle."
2195.0,2196.0, Yeah.
2196.0,2198.0, And you'd use that for distance encounters.
2198.0,2201.0," And it's really satisfying because, I mean,"
2201.0,2204.0," not just the cook and a clock thing, but you have like,"
2204.0,2205.0, you have that one chance.
2205.0,2206.0," And then you're reloading is going to take a,"
2206.0,2209.0," take a little bit, you know, and then if they get close,"
2209.0,2211.0, you switch your submachine gun or something.
2211.0,2214.0," Here now, I mean, you have sniper, you know, weapons and stuff."
2214.0,2217.0, I haven't really found a map where maybe it may be one map where
2217.0,2220.0, it's the kind of weapon that would make sense in the way that it did
2220.0,2223.0, in the map called Bocage from called U2.
2223.0,2226.0," But it's like, you can have a machine gun, you know,"
2226.0,2229.0," like a saw or something, squad automatic."
2229.0,2231.0, And shoot across the map.
2231.0,2233.0," And if you've got the right perks attached to you,"
2233.0,2235.0," it's like, it's just about the same thing."
2235.0,2239.0," I mean, you, you, you have the crosshair on their head and you're going to hit"
2239.0,2240.0, them.
2240.0,2243.0," I love being a sniper, but I fucking hate snipers."
2243.0,2247.0," When I, when I get to be one, and I'm picking guys off from across the map,"
2247.0,2249.0, I'm always kind of laughing behind my monitor.
2249.0,2251.0, This is when I get picked off by a monitor.
2251.0,2254.0, I'm a by a sniper when I get picked off.
2254.0,2255.0, I'm so mad.
2255.0,2256.0, I'm fucking lurking sniper.
2256.0,2259.0, He's get get out there and fight.
2259.0,2261.0, There's so few maps in in C.O.D.
2261.0,2265.0, where they have like just these big empty fields of view where you have to cross
2265.0,2268.0, them and basically be at a serious disadvantage.
2268.0,2270.0," And there's tons and because the way the spawn system works,"
2270.0,2272.0, they can appear behind you at any time.
2272.0,2273.0, They just spawn in behind you.
2273.0,2274.0, Yeah.
2274.0,2275.0, And that's a problem.
2275.0,2278.0, I think my biggest problem with the game are the spawns.
2278.0,2282.0," And the deal with C.O.D. formal players that it takes,"
2282.0,2286.0, there's like X number of potential spawn points in any map.
2286.0,2288.0," And then it says like if you're in a team-based game,"
2288.0,2290.0," where the majority of your teammates now,"
2290.0,2294.0, we're going to spawn you in one of those fixed spawn points closest to them.
2294.0,2295.0, Right?
2295.0,2300.0, And that is such an awesome solution in some ways because it means that you don't have this
2300.0,2301.0, like where the hell are my teammates?
2301.0,2303.0, How am I going to catch up with them again?
2303.0,2310.0, Or rather let's go around this huge map looking for someone to fight or looking for some kind of action or anything.
2310.0,2312.0, So they totally like nail that with that.
2312.0,2319.0, But the downside is just that there are often moments in any game where there's a lot of potential for exploitation.
2319.0,2323.0," And that's when you see a group of guys throw your air strikes on it, throw your grenades,"
2323.0,2326.0," keep throwing your grenades on it because chances are not only will you kill those that are there,"
2326.0,2328.0, but others that are appearing in that area too.
2328.0,2332.0," So you get those moments where for me they're equivalent of being a sniper,"
2332.0,2335.0," you know, hating a sniper is coming in and like an air strike blows me up."
2335.0,2339.0," I spawned in and then the guys air strike bottom, a helicopter,"
2339.0,2341.0, and then there's the fucking attack chopper ripping me up.
2341.0,2343.0," And then you do it a third time and you're like,"
2343.0,2345.0, there's a grenade that got me.
2345.0,2346.0, Fuck!
2346.0,2347.0, Yeah.
2347.0,2348.0, Yeah.
2348.0,2349.0, Yeah.
2349.0,2354.0, So I think that's a huge part of multiplayer is making excuses for everything and the strategy.
2354.0,2355.0," Well, sure."
2355.0,2360.0, It's such a plain competitive multiplayer game such as just an angry miserable business.
2360.0,2362.0, When things aren't going your way.
2362.0,2363.0," Yeah, when you're losing."
2363.0,2364.0, It's just when you're losing.
2364.0,2365.0, Yeah.
2365.0,2367.0, It's so easy to just get turned into just this rate.
2367.0,2369.0," Wretched piece of shit, you know."
2369.0,2372.0," And then you're in your team speaking, you got to tell each other,"
2372.0,2373.0," chill out, quirky."
2373.0,2375.0," Yeah, that was fun to me with that."
2375.0,2382.0, With that game on Xbox Live was all the shit talking that was happening amongst team members.
2382.0,2383.0, About each other.
2383.0,2384.0, Yeah.
2384.0,2386.0," Get off my team, you fucking piece of shit."
2386.0,2387.0," Like, you know, that happened."
2387.0,2389.0," Well, you're kind of a piece of shit, right?"
2389.0,2390.0, Where do you live?
2390.0,2392.0, I'll come kick your ass in real life.
2392.0,2393.0, Yeah.
2393.0,2395.0," I like to see you cry, frigate."
2395.0,2397.0, And nonstop.
2397.0,2399.0," Why'd you say that, Joe?"
2399.0,2400.0, I'm quoting.
2400.0,2401.0," I know, I know."
2401.0,2404.0," No, that's probably the most used word on Xbox Live."
2404.0,2407.0, That's probably the least.
2407.0,2408.0, Yeah.
2408.0,2414.0," Quite, yeah, it is like, I mean, it's kind of like, in every game there's something in where,"
2414.0,2417.0," where is it, you know, team fortress two, it's criticals."
2417.0,2418.0, He got a crit.
2418.0,2419.0," Oh, great."
2419.0,2421.0," You got a crit, so you want."
2421.0,2422.0, Yeah.
2422.0,2426.0," Now, the problem of having the persistent ranks and the ability to, you know,"
2426.0,2429.0," unlock new weapons and new properties for your characters that,"
2429.0,2430.0," Oh, great."
2430.0,2431.0, You poop socked it.
2431.0,2432.0, So you got your god character.
2432.0,2433.0, That's pretty fun.
2433.0,2437.0," Come back here again, level 41 and show me how it's like to have no recoil to have three"
2437.0,2440.0, grenades to have like extra stopping power.
2440.0,2445.0," Oh, that's great gun that I can't ever get unless I'm lucky enough to kill you with a grenade that I say."
2445.0,2446.0, I fall so you didn't get that.
2446.0,2449.0," But I mean, though, I don't think these are necessarily fair complaints."
2449.0,2455.0," Some of you can sell ways they are, but it's like, I'm just saying, I'm, I'm commenting not on the game in this point,"
2455.0,2456.0, but I just didn't make sure of multiplayer.
2456.0,2461.0, I think giving people excuses is vital to maintaining a healthy player base.
2461.0,2462.0, Exactly.
2463.0,2464.0," Yeah, dude, it is."
2464.0,2468.0," It's like a good, yeah, you want to build for it in certain circumstances."
2468.0,2473.0," However, that said when you start off CED4 multiplayer, you are at a distinct disadvantage."
2473.0,2475.0," You're a level 1, do we?"
2475.0,2476.0," Yeah, you're at the loop."
2476.0,2477.0, You got nothing.
2477.0,2480.0," Yeah, because they have, I mean, how do you, how do you get hooked up with other players at that point?"
2480.0,2483.0," Do they try to, does it try to put you with the other net level 1 news?"
2483.0,2484.0," Not on PC, dude."
2484.0,2488.0," No, they're just, you can't even, like, that's one problem with it."
2488.0,2491.0, They don't have level filters or not that I'm aware of it.
2491.0,2493.0," You know, this is crazy."
2493.0,2494.0," Like, any got to get that wrong."
2494.0,2498.0," If you ever want to fault something about the game, like about the multiplayer part of the game,"
2498.0,2500.0," there's like, it's like a trampoline."
2500.0,2504.0," It will just push you back harder because there's some like very credible excuse for everything, right?"
2504.0,2508.0," It's like, oh, God, I preferred it when they didn't have this radar bullshit."
2508.0,2512.0, Why do I have to spend half my time looking at this radar knowing where people are at and
2512.0,2514.0, and worrying about them knowing where I'm at?
2514.0,2517.0," Well, it's like, you can turn the radar, a server host can turn the radar off, right?"
2517.0,2518.0, Right.
2518.0,2522.0," If you're bitching about air strikes, they can turn the helicopter off, they can turn the helicopter and the jet off."
2522.0,2530.0," They can turn, you know, either or, and on and on, you can make it so that some people can't use some class or weapon."
2530.0,2535.0, Every single thing is a variable that a server host can manipulate.
2535.0,2538.0," However, you can't search by these criteria."
2538.0,2546.0," So when something, unless you're networked in some way, it's not immediately helpful to you because if the server's not called no radars,"
2546.0,2550.0," have fun, then you go in and you look and you see if there's a radar not."
2550.0,2553.0," It's assimilarily, there's like no friends list."
2553.0,2556.0," So finding a game, the browser is really an elegant."
2556.0,2560.0, So it'll just keep pinging and pinging and it's very successful.
2560.0,2564.0," So there'd be 3,000 servers up at a time and your friends like I'm in."
2564.0,2571.0," Okay, it's team death mesh and it's called close bracket 59th bracket smiley face."
2571.0,2572.0, You know whatever.
2573.0,2582.0," Yeah, so I can't wait for it to come out on steam and I hope the friends list works for it there because I always see all of the steam."
2582.0,2583.0, Right options.
2583.0,2585.0, So then I'll just join those.
2585.0,2586.0," Right, new to only."
2586.0,2588.0," Yeah, first time players only."
2588.0,2589.0, Yeah.
2589.0,2591.0, So it's a fun game.
2591.0,2601.0," And I think the like to put it end on that would be as you do rank up and after you get past that initial disability, then it does really become fun to mess with."
2601.0,2602.0, Very common.
2602.0,2606.0, Because you have three perks you have primary secondary weapon and a type of explosive.
2606.0,2609.0, Looks like an MMO in that way.
2609.0,2610.0, It is.
2610.0,2618.0, Not like it's to be in a level one and some maps are good for but also in an MMO where you're like I'm going to be going up against these guys or this is the makeup of my group like.
2618.0,2622.0, And you and you figure it out and you have a number of presets and so you just pick this one.
2622.0,2623.0, I'm going to this map.
2623.0,2629.0, This is actually a good a perfect map for say say for example the map is very small and close quarters.
2629.0,2643.0," What you could then do is be a quick move quickly, which is by carrying nothing but the lightest gun you can use your knife all the time sprint around in a quick martyrdom and what happens is you see a group of guys run into them stab as many as you can the rest kill you."
2643.0,2645.0, You drop your grenade and then it blows the rest up mob.
2645.0,2647.0, So your ratio is always going to be like one one.
2647.0,2649.0, It's not going to be like 30 kills and two deaths.
2649.0,2654.0," It's going to be like 50 kills and 50 deaths, but you still like end up with the highest score on the right."
2654.0,2656.0, It's great for ranking up.
2656.0,2664.0, I mean that would be one example and all the sorts of combinations there's something that allow you to basically make yourself into a turret and all these things.
2664.0,2670.0, They may prove some of them may prove like annoying in the long run or bounce whatever and that's what patches are for.
2670.0,2672.0, But it's great and it's adding longevity to this.
2672.0,2679.0, And also you know credit here that they've got both a single player and a multiplayer game that are great totally in their own different ways.
2679.0,2680.0, Yeah absolutely.
2680.0,2685.0, I mean there haven't been that many games that have been able to deliver on both without compromising on one of the other.
2685.0,2688.0, Maybe either actually only offering one.
2688.0,2692.0, So they went both ways with this and they and they they done good.
2692.0,2697.0, I hope they get the guys made with that tape are you me about that.
2697.0,2709.0, I don't think it's a guy's that made the promise the expansion for the first COD to do one because it would be interesting to see how it would work with like a few vehicles like a BMP and a G for something.
2709.0,2711.0, I like the.
2711.0,2714.0, What was it called United offensive expansion.
2714.0,2715.0, I was going to say that was the one.
2715.0,2728.0, Those guys were definitely capable of under they got it basically they understood what with their campaign what infinity word was doing and what made they're getting good and basically you know reproduce to to.
2728.0,2730.0, So GFW says thumbs up.
2730.0,2738.0, Yeah on call duty four stop yeah stop reading one complaint and getting your your panties all twisted and.
2738.0,2741.0, Yeah internet more on here that.
2742.0,2744.0, We're calling you out.
2744.0,2747.0, Internet stupid heads true.
2747.0,2749.0, And that's stupid.
2749.0,2751.0, Right.
2751.0,2753.0, But we got more games.
2753.0,2756.0, We have a lot of games that this rate we're going to be podcast until mid.
2756.0,2758.0, We just we should take a break.
2758.0,2762.0, Holy shit we're the we should take a break now after one one game.
2762.0,2764.0, Yeah we got to go on one more game.
2764.0,2765.0, One more game.
2765.0,2766.0, One more game.
2766.0,2767.0, Quick one.
2768.0,2770.0, The what.
2770.0,2772.0, So Sam.
2772.0,2776.0, So Sam max season two episode one came out.
2776.0,2779.0, Okay on the yesterday the eighth I believe.
2779.0,2782.0, So you can get that like on I think it's on.
2782.0,2784.0, I'm steam on game to happen all that.
2784.0,2788.0, But first first episode of the second season of.
2788.0,2790.0, Telltale episodic.
2790.0,2792.0, Sam and Max adventure game series.
2792.0,2794.0, They continue to be on a roll with the episodic releases.
2794.0,2795.0, Right.
2796.0,2797.0, And then the other one company.
2797.0,2798.0, We said this before.
2798.0,2803.0, But they're the one company that's really stuck to a pretty solid really schedule.
2803.0,2805.0, I mean they're a lot smaller.
2805.0,2810.0, Right I mean they well they understand what it means to be episodic.
2810.0,2816.0," But you know, is this a good episode."
2816.0,2817.0, It's a good episode.
2817.0,2821.0, It's probably it's I would say it's one of the better episodes.
2822.0,2824.0, There's a continued from season one.
2824.0,2830.0," Or is it like, you know, it's a you know there's there's a few kind of references back to season one."
2830.0,2833.0, You could certainly jump into it without having played that.
2833.0,2834.0, So it's an all new story.
2834.0,2840.0, They keep they keep the structure pretty much the same because you all in season one you always expected that you're going to be going to boss get a buy something.
2840.0,2841.0, You're always going to be going to be going to.
2841.0,2848.0, No they they mix that up a bit like you know every other episode you know you get a phone call telling you this is what you got to do.
2848.0,2857.0, And I think by the thing from Bosco see what civil wacky new job is solve the trio the trio of puzzle trios and wrap it up.
2857.0,2860.0, They don't have any kind of like Nikki and Palo sort of thing going on though.
2860.0,2863.0, They didn't introduce like new characters that are making a go where the hell.
2863.0,2864.0, But they're all salmon max.
2864.0,2866.0, They're talking to with the whole time.
2866.0,2871.0, Yeah why they talking to a friend and there's a couple of new characters.
2871.0,2872.0, Yep.
2872.0,2877.0, Well there's one of the dudes they introduced that hardcore Santa Max comment fans will know is this crazy.
2877.0,2882.0, Private detective named Flint paper who's Santa Max is insane next door neighbor.
2882.0,2887.0, And this probably shons about to last at me here.
2887.0,2888.0, What?
2888.0,2892.0, But layman everything I'm just thinking about how I got a cold cash call back.
2892.0,2902.0, But um a lot of the these Santa Max hardcore fans were asking about that kind of particular character for a while so they added him to the game and there's.
2902.0,2907.0, There's a new like location on Santa Max's street it's like this this diner.
2907.0,2909.0, That sounds fine.
2909.0,2910.0, Yeah and uh.
2910.0,2914.0, And like Jeff had to worry about.
2914.0,2915.0, Can you guys just listen to him?
2915.0,2916.0, I'm sorry.
2916.0,2917.0, I love salmon.
2917.0,2918.0, Yeah.
2918.0,2919.0, And so I'm too.
2919.0,2924.0, The whole the whole insane plot of this episode is that uh Santa's gun nuts.
2924.0,2931.0, And you have to go to the north pole to figure out why he's out sourced all of his toy making labor and locked himself in a room with a gun.
2931.0,2939.0, Isn't this isn't I'm doing a Christmas episode right now kind of like Fred Claus coming out right now at the theater.
2939.0,2940.0, Yeah.
2940.0,2941.0, You know.
2941.0,2943.0, There's some ghosts in that.
2943.0,2944.0," Oh, they are."
2944.0,2945.0, They're making fun of the.
2945.0,2946.0, Why are we doing this?
2946.0,2947.0, It's the middle of November.
2947.0,2948.0," Oh, okay."
2948.0,2949.0," Well, then they're okay."
2949.0,2950.0, They're moving.
2950.0,2951.0, Yeah.
2951.0,2954.0," Because I don't think they probably get that in Fred Claus, you know, they probably weren't saying."
2954.0,2956.0, Did you see Fred Claus?
2956.0,2960.0," No, but I saw the pre that that preview alone offended me."
2960.0,2961.0, Yeah.
2961.0,2963.0, How many fucking more Santa Claus movies do we need?
2963.0,2964.0, The need.
2964.0,2965.0, The miracle on the 3 4 Street.
2965.0,2966.0, The end.
2966.0,2967.0, No.
2967.0,2968.0, The Christmas story is good.
2968.0,2969.0, That's worth seeing.
2969.0,2970.0, Yeah.
2970.0,2971.0, I got you.
2971.0,2975.0, You got the Santa Claus and you got the Santa Claus to and you got elf.
2975.0,2976.0, Okay.
2976.0,2977.0, There are some claws.
2977.0,2978.0, Don't forget the Mrs. Claus.
2978.0,2979.0, Those aren't good.
2979.0,2981.0, You trying to say the Santa Claus is good.
2981.0,2982.0, It's Ryan.
2982.0,2983.0, I haven't even seen it.
2983.0,2984.0, I know it ain't good.
2984.0,2985.0, It's got to be better than Fred.
2985.0,2987.0, I was saying that on the Internet board.
2987.0,2988.0, I saw a movie.
2988.0,2990.0," You know, I saw, I'm sorry."
2990.0,2996.0," Have you seen the, there's a preview for some new Dustin Hoffman movie with Natalie Portman."
2996.0,2998.0," Oh, Mr. McGonacles."
2998.0,2999.0, Wonder Emporium.
2999.0,3000.0, Yes.
3000.0,3001.0, It's like a rhyming cryo.
3001.0,3002.0, Wonder Emporium.
3002.0,3003.0, Yeah.
3003.0,3006.0, There's this movie looks like such a piece of shit.
3006.0,3009.0," Alice, I saw what's called a Dan in real life."
3009.0,3012.0," They had the night with my family, which is a pretty good movie."
3012.0,3015.0, The Steve Coral and there were a bunch of previews in a row.
3015.0,3016.0, And they were all comedies.
3016.0,3018.0, And they all got like a fair amount of laughs.
3018.0,3019.0, And this thing came on.
3019.0,3022.0, This Mr. McGorium's Wonder Erwitt.
3022.0,3024.0, And the theater was fucking dead silent.
3024.0,3027.0," It was just like, you could smell the bomb in the preview."
3027.0,3031.0," And that's rare for that to happen in a theater, because normally people will laugh at anything."
3031.0,3032.0," Well, that's what I'm saying."
3032.0,3033.0," It was like, wow."
3033.0,3037.0," The second I saw that, I was just Ryan did immediately of a Simpsons episode for like"
3037.0,3040.0," 10 years ago, where a train lookler."
3040.0,3044.0, It's been coming back movie after his terrible career.
3044.0,3050.0," You know, dive was a fabulous cab of trap shots of Professor cubulous cubulous cubulous cubulous."
3050.0,3053.0," Like, like, I really thought of that when I saw this."
3053.0,3054.0, Yeah.
3054.0,3055.0, Yeah.
3055.0,3059.0," As soon as you see Dustin Hoffman on the screen with all these like CGI toys, you're just like,"
3059.0,3060.0," Oh, dude."
3060.0,3062.0, What happened to your career?
3062.0,3066.0," On the other hand, Natalie apartments in it, and she looks pretty good as always."
3066.0,3067.0, Nope.
3067.0,3070.0, This reminds me that I used to work in a movie theater concession stand.
3070.0,3071.0, I did do it.
3071.0,3072.0, You did?
3072.0,3073.0, Really?
3073.0,3074.0, It did.
3074.0,3077.0, You have to close clean that shit up clean that not show cheese machine and the popcorn machine.
3077.0,3080.0, I played every role at that theater at one point.
3080.0,3081.0, Wow.
3081.0,3082.0, You were the Renaissance man of the theater.
3082.0,3083.0, Dollar theater too.
3083.0,3084.0, So that's some man.
3084.0,3088.0," I would do this thing where like, I told everyone to go up in the film booth and then"
3088.0,3089.0, the look down.
3089.0,3090.0, And then you know how the usher is.
3090.0,3092.0," You kind of like sometimes when you're in a theater, they'll like do a little check."
3092.0,3093.0, They'll walk down the island.
3093.0,3094.0, That's to do that.
3094.0,3097.0," And then I'll do that the flashlight, but I would do like this thing with my leg where I"
3097.0,3100.0, made it look like my ankles all gimped out and then drag it behind me.
3100.0,3104.0," So I dragged down the entire leg to the theater all serious, you know."
3104.0,3107.0, And then do the turnaround like drag it in this big wide arc.
3107.0,3109.0, And like it was a whale tail or something.
3109.0,3111.0, And then just go back up to.
3111.0,3112.0, That's not funny.
3112.0,3115.0, That's what I do.
3115.0,3116.0, I do it once.
3116.0,3117.0, What I do it.
3117.0,3119.0, I like to point out the Shawn just stood up and acted that.
3119.0,3120.0," Yeah, you did."
3120.0,3125.0, And then like if we were filming this podcast that I caught like what's I was taking the trash out.
3125.0,3129.0," And because you know how when you work in a rest a gross ass restaurant like that,"
3129.0,3132.0, they got the friars and you got to take grease to the special recept.
3132.0,3136.0," Yeah, yeah, you can't dump it in the nowadays like the hippies would come and ask for it."
3136.0,3139.0, So they can feel their lawnmower with it or something.
3139.0,3141.0, But they're in these before their hacky sack game.
3141.0,3145.0, Making sweet sweet tender love like right back there by the dumpster.
3145.0,3146.0, Wow.
3146.0,3149.0," Instead of being all cool about it, I read back getting got everyone else."
3149.0,3150.0, And like come check this out.
3150.0,3153.0, Then we open the door and we're all staying there like.
3153.0,3154.0, Wow.
3154.0,3156.0, It was a good one.
3156.0,3157.0, You.
3157.0,3159.0, So back on salmon max.
3159.0,3162.0," Uh, had we get there?"
3162.0,3163.0, Santa.
3163.0,3164.0, Santa.
3164.0,3165.0, Santa.
3165.0,3166.0, I'm sorry.
3166.0,3167.0, You were talking about bad Santa.
3167.0,3168.0," Hey, bad Santa, there's another one."
3168.0,3170.0, You're asking talking about bad Santa.
3170.0,3173.0," Oh, bad Santa had Lauren Graham from Gilmore girls in it."
3173.0,3174.0, No.
3174.0,3175.0, Awesome.
3175.0,3180.0, I think that was kind of decent because it had Lauren Graham from Gilmore girls.
3180.0,3182.0, That was the one that kid had a steak or something.
3182.0,3185.0," Yeah, a caramel steak and Lauren Graham."
3185.0,3186.0, All right.
3186.0,3187.0, So Santa.
3187.0,3189.0, To bad Santa in the salmon max.
3189.0,3191.0, So salmon max season two episode one.
3191.0,3193.0, I station Santa.
3193.0,3194.0, Good game.
3194.0,3196.0, And some of the sky was those games sometimes.
3196.0,3199.0, You guys got to also get to end it with just take my word for it.
3199.0,3200.0, It's funny.
3200.0,3201.0, It's like Santa.
3201.0,3202.0, Yeah.
3202.0,3203.0, Like the avalanche in one.
3203.0,3207.0, So not funny to someone who doesn't understand or hasn't played a seven max and knows if they like it or not.
3207.0,3208.0, Yeah.
3208.0,3209.0, A blink and comes back.
3209.0,3210.0, There's a talking.
3210.0,3211.0, He's breaking it.
3211.0,3212.0, No way.
3212.0,3214.0, Ryan's genuinely into it though.
3214.0,3215.0, I hear him.
3215.0,3216.0, It is really.
3216.0,3217.0, All day long when he's playing.
3217.0,3219.0, You hear him like do your left dude.
3219.0,3220.0, Do that last.
3220.0,3221.0, Ha ha.
3221.0,3222.0, Here's live.
3222.0,3223.0, He's not your performing.
3223.0,3224.0, See you laugh and hard.
3224.0,3226.0, He'll be laughing hard when he's playing that.
3226.0,3227.0, What are you doing?
3227.0,3228.0, Playing salmon man.
3228.0,3229.0, Awesome.
3229.0,3230.0, Santa.
3230.0,3231.0, They are very good games.
3232.0,3234.0, I'm only three episodes in.
3234.0,3235.0, Oh.
3235.0,3236.0, Okay.
3236.0,3238.0, But I'm like in season one a lot.
3238.0,3241.0, I steamed up the last episode of season one the other day.
3241.0,3242.0, But haven't actually loaded it.
3242.0,3243.0, It's a good one.
3243.0,3246.0, Sam and Max.
3246.0,3250.0, I think I might have said this on one other podcast.
3250.0,3252.0, Maybe it was our boarded one.
3252.0,3253.0, Yeah.
3253.0,3258.0, Sam and Max and the Phoenix Wright games on the DS.
3259.0,3260.0, Uh huh.
3260.0,3263.0, It's kind of the closest we've come to.
3263.0,3268.0, Sort of the good franchise adventure games of like the Sierra and LucasArts days.
3268.0,3270.0, The Phoenix Wrights are holding up for you.
3270.0,3271.0, Phoenix Wrights are good.
3271.0,3272.0, Okay.
3272.0,3276.0, I were going to make a list of the 10 best adventure games I've ever played.
3276.0,3278.0, The most recent Phoenix Wright would probably be on it.
3278.0,3279.0, Really.
3279.0,3280.0, Yeah.
3280.0,3283.0, You're including all the old LucasArts and Sierra games.
3283.0,3284.0, I think so.
3284.0,3285.0, Wow.
3285.0,3286.0, Wow.
3286.0,3288.0, Phoenix Wrights really good.
3288.0,3290.0, And Sam and Max's.
3290.0,3292.0, Did you play Sanitarium?
3292.0,3293.0, I did not.
3293.0,3294.0, I did.
3294.0,3295.0, You did.
3295.0,3296.0, I love Sanitarium.
3296.0,3297.0, Wasn't that an awesome game?
3297.0,3301.0, Now in the kind of forgotten dustbin of PC gaming history.
3301.0,3302.0, Very much so.
3302.0,3304.0, That was forgotten like weeks after.
3304.0,3306.0, That was a game to happen.
3306.0,3307.0, It should be.
3307.0,3308.0," If you're listening to me,"
3308.0,3310.0," Valve, please find Sanitarium."
3310.0,3312.0, It was made by Dream Forge.
3312.0,3315.0," Uh, and they now I'm pretty sure the fun to company."
3315.0,3317.0, Did Valve define it and put it on a game tab?
3317.0,3318.0," Uh, no."
3318.0,3319.0, Did I say that?
3319.0,3320.0, Yeah.
3320.0,3321.0, You did.
3321.0,3322.0," Oh, really?"
3322.0,3323.0," Well, that would be kind of fucked up."
3323.0,3326.0, Valve can find it and put it on steam if they like.
3326.0,3327.0, If they prefer.
3327.0,3329.0, If they want to go that wacky direction.
3329.0,3331.0," Otherwise, they could put it on a game tab."
3331.0,3333.0, Valve can do whatever they want.
3333.0,3335.0, And should we take a break?
3335.0,3336.0, Let's take the break.
3336.0,3338.0, We're taking our obligatory break.
3338.0,3341.0, And we'll be back with all sorts of more fascinating.
3341.0,3344.0, In amazing things.
3344.0,3345.0, Virtual to talk about.
3345.0,3346.0, Yeah.
3346.0,3349.0, Can we?
3349.0,3350.0, That.
3350.0,3351.0, That.
3351.0,3353.0, That.
3353.0,3354.0, Fine.
3354.0,3355.0, You can cut that.
3355.0,3356.0, You're going to leave that.
3356.0,3357.0, That's all.
3357.0,3363.0, This one at podcast is bought to you by the Doreeta's presents Unlock Xbox Contest.

3375.0,3376.0, You like that?
3376.0,3377.0, I like that.
3377.0,3378.0, Sounds like Helgate.
3378.0,3380.0," Oh, nice."
3380.0,3383.0, That's the best segue I've ever heard.
3383.0,3385.0, Helgate.
3385.0,3386.0, Yeah.
3386.0,3388.0," Man, we sure waited a long time to play that game."
3388.0,3389.0, We did.
3389.0,3390.0, I still haven't played it.
3390.0,3391.0, You suck.
3391.0,3393.0, I can't believe it.
3393.0,3395.0, I think we didn't just wait.
3395.0,3397.0, Like we're kind of waited to get our free copy.
3397.0,3399.0, We waited to get our free copy.
3399.0,3402.0, We'll Ryan gave him all out to like street urchins or something.
3402.0,3404.0, But there were five that we don't have anymore.
3404.0,3405.0, Yeah.
3405.0,3406.0, That's what happened.
3406.0,3407.0, That's them all to the same person.
3407.0,3408.0, We can't believe it.
3408.0,3409.0, I don't understand.
3409.0,3410.0, Yeah.
3410.0,3411.0, Just in case.
3411.0,3414.0, I think we're all over the map on our opinion.
3414.0,3415.0, Helgate.
3415.0,3416.0, Aren't we kids?
3416.0,3417.0, Sounds like you.
3417.0,3418.0, You like sure.
3418.0,3420.0, You're on the same page kind of.
3420.0,3421.0, Yeah.
3421.0,3422.0, Maybe.
3422.0,3423.0, I think we're probably all on the same page.
3423.0,3424.0, Yeah.
3424.0,3425.0, I think we'll be less agree.
3425.0,3426.0, Yeah.
3426.0,3430.0, The depending on your your tolerance for for shopping and killing.
3430.0,3431.0, That's the game.
3431.0,3432.0, Yeah.
3432.0,3433.0, That is.
3433.0,3435.0, Sounds like a girls game.
3435.0,3437.0, You want to take this outside.
3437.0,3439.0, Shuffing and killing.
3439.0,3440.0, You like the apple.
3440.0,3441.0, Yeah.
3441.0,3443.0," Don't you like the the apple games, Ryan?"
3443.0,3445.0, Fun fact.
3445.0,3447.0, I have never played the apple.
3447.0,3449.0, The things we learned about that guy.
3449.0,3452.0, That was a series that I missed.
3452.0,3454.0, How do you missed the apple?
3454.0,3455.0, I didn't get the apple.
3455.0,3456.0, I didn't get the apple.
3456.0,3457.0, I didn't get the apple.
3457.0,3458.0, I didn't get the apple.
3458.0,3461.0, I didn't get into warcraft until warcraft three.
3461.0,3463.0, I later got into starcraft.
3463.0,3464.0, I beat you on that.
3464.0,3467.0, I need to reinterview you for this job.
3467.0,3468.0, Hey.
3468.0,3471.0, And in the reinterview you don't get the job.
3471.0,3472.0, What the hell?
3472.0,3473.0, I see how it is.
3473.0,3475.0, The thing with the apple though.
3475.0,3477.0," I mean, of course, it's got to come off."
3477.0,3479.0," But, you know, maybe I said the same people."
3479.0,3481.0, But that that was always one of those games.
3481.0,3483.0," You asked people, why is this game so good?"
3483.0,3484.0, Make the case.
3484.0,3485.0, Why do I need to go back and play it?
3485.0,3489.0, At this point that I'm hearing about it or at the point that I have the PC capable of playing
3489.0,3490.0, it.
3490.0,3491.0, It's been a few years.
3491.0,3494.0, And the case has always been like you were saying about Sam and Max.
3494.0,3498.0, And those are generally cases that I'm suspicious on still.
3498.0,3502.0, Where it's just like you just got to play it or it's the certain something unnameable
3502.0,3503.0, something about it.
3503.0,3506.0," And it'd be like, yeah, the gameplay actually is boring."
3506.0,3508.0, But it's something about collecting.
3508.0,3511.0," And then what I was hearing, you know, this was interesting here from, you know, from Roy,"
3511.0,3516.0," who was a big Diablo fan played it, you know, nonstop hour after hour after hour after hour."
3516.0,3521.0, And it's not so interested in how gate after playing that is that it is like the same game.
3521.0,3525.0, But then that's that's what's missing from how gate is that whatever that certain something.
3525.0,3528.0, It's a definable aspect of Diablo.
3528.0,3530.0," Yeah, for for me, the."
3530.0,3531.0, The.
3531.0,3533.0, Helgate is very much the.
3533.0,3537.0, Diablo and it's not even like being in 3D is about the only advancement.
3537.0,3540.0, It's making because you still have the same random dungeon.
3540.0,3551.0, I was actually surprised at how Diablo should work like me to the advancements were like micro advancements things like being able to break down things in your inventory instead of having to go back to town to sell them.
3551.0,3553.0, Those are how I were counting.
3553.0,3558.0," The, you know, the ways or like the murals don't when they explode, they don't hurt you."
3558.0,3559.0," And I was like, well, good."
3559.0,3560.0, That's an improvement.
3560.0,3561.0, Right.
3561.0,3566.0," Other than that, I'm just like this is exactly the apple right down to the red and blue blue orbs on the side of your interface."
3566.0,3569.0," I mean, it's frighteningly like Diablo."
3569.0,3570.0, Right.
3570.0,3573.0, But it doesn't have that that blizzard something.
3573.0,3574.0, We really polish.
3574.0,3575.0, Even.
3575.0,3580.0, There is what does that have a kind of junkiness to it in my.
3580.0,3582.0," In my opinion, the fee did overall feel."
3582.0,3585.0," It's I mean, it's off to call polish, you know, yeah, yeah."
3585.0,3589.0," And it's like, I hate to use the term, but in this case, I feel that yeah, like there's."
3589.0,3590.0, It's lacking that.
3590.0,3593.0," I mean, it feels a lot of them are most striking that way too."
3593.0,3600.0," And I think looking at World Warcraft, that might in fact be the only MMO that doesn't seem like it has that little element of junkiness to it."
3600.0,3601.0, Mm-hmm.
3601.0,3603.0," Even ones that really like, like auto assault totally junky."
3603.0,3604.0, Great game.
3604.0,3607.0, Like they didn't hire a real art director sort of thing or stuff like that.
3607.0,3608.0, Yeah.
3608.0,3612.0," It's the combination of, I mean, a lot of it's technical limitations."
3612.0,3616.0," You know, when you have that many enemies on screen, when you have that many players connected to the world."
3616.0,3620.0," And so it's, you know, combination of yeah, the art direction, the animation and all these other things."
3620.0,3625.0," I think probably in Warcraft's case, it's the animation that really, I mean the art design that's really cohesive."
3625.0,3626.0, Yeah.
3626.0,3630.0," Whereas, you know, like, tabulaross, I still get that same feeling of like, kind of junkiness in it."
3630.0,3631.0," Yeah, I agree."
3631.0,3634.0," And like, again, this is a game that I like a great deal."
3634.0,3643.0," Yeah, for Hellgette, it's just like little things like when you kill some flying creature and a dead floating in midair that just, you notice that kind of thing because it obviously shouldn't be floating in the mirror."
3643.0,3644.0, Even the icons.
3644.0,3649.0," Or like in the, if you look at your skill tree, like there's something about the blizzard design of icons that just makes you want to be."
3649.0,3655.0, I agree with the skill tree screen looks like a placeholder art to me.
3655.0,3656.0, It really does.
3656.0,3658.0," Yeah, like it looks low res."
3658.0,3661.0," You can't, I can't even see what the icons are that I'm looking at."
3661.0,3665.0," I mean, yeah, it just feels like are you, are you not done? Are you kidding?"
3665.0,3667.0, This is the screen you put here.
3667.0,3669.0, We've played in first person perspective.
3669.0,3676.0, The guns look like they all came out of red faction or something for it's basically like say you're in wood shop and fourth grade.
3676.0,3681.0," You know, when you start like blue and in mail and like, like, a lot of shots together."
3681.0,3689.0," And then tell you say it's a gun and it's basically a gun because there's something to hold and then there's a kind of a, you agree that there's a barrel at one end."
3689.0,3691.0," It's kind of like that, right?"
3691.0,3694.0," If you wouldn't wedges, yeah, coming to a point."
3694.0,3701.0," And then, of course, the, I don't know if it was, if it's more of a latency thing or not, but the animation is just like super slow."
3701.0,3716.0," Moin a lot of things like when you kill someone and then when it goes into ragdoll state, it's just this kind of floaty weird or you blow up a like an explosive panister or like a crate and it just flot like I just shot a wood pallet and it splinters like it was a guy damn desk, our blown up."
3716.0,3718.0," You know, like there's a lot of that."
3718.0,3725.0," Yeah, yeah, I have to say that the, my first impression with Helgate was quite good."
3725.0,3734.0," And so my, my gut reaction because it's gotten so much negative press and lots of people complaining online was like, well, it's, this is actually pretty fun."
3734.0,3736.0, Like I was surprised how much I was enjoying it.
3736.0,3740.0," And my, my initial feeling of, well, I better check this thing out."
3740.0,3743.0," Um, became like, I really want to play this."
3743.0,3749.0," And so my Saturday of like, I'm going to boot this up and look at it turned into like I'm playing Helgate all day."
3749.0,3751.0," Yeah, I got the same reaction."
3751.0,3757.0, And I was playing single player and I got to level eight and I like to enough that my boyfriend Keith was watching me.
3757.0,3762.0," And we were both kind of like, you want to play this together and like, yeah, I think I kind of do."
3762.0,3763.0, So we went and bought another one.
3763.0,3764.0, Wow.
3764.0,3767.0, So he actually went to the store and bought the other one after playing it.
3767.0,3768.0, After playing it.
3768.0,3769.0, That's what I should have gave you.
3769.0,3770.0, I could have gave you mine.
3770.0,3772.0, So that okay.
3772.0,3778.0," So I mean, and in single player, I wasn't having any of the like technical issues that cropped up during multi player."
3778.0,3783.0," Yeah, when we started doing multi player like, you would be crashing more or all the way."
3783.0,3787.0," Of course, you played the single player for a while until you realize how about single players a wasted time."
3787.0,3789.0," Yeah, then I realized that as soon as we started multi player."
3789.0,3790.0, Right.
3790.0,3795.0," How about this for when we every time you turn the game off, was it because you crashed out?"
3795.0,3797.0," I mean, for me, I'd never turned it off."
3797.0,3800.0, I always quit playing when it just told me to quit playing by crashing.
3800.0,3803.0, I crashed a hell of a lot in multi player.
3803.0,3805.0," And yeah, we are, I mean, definitely we're against single player."
3805.0,3807.0, I chose with when to stop right hit like all the nine or so.
3807.0,3810.0," And like, that's really tired, but I still like could have played more."
3810.0,3812.0," Yeah, then I stopped on purpose."
3812.0,3814.0, And I think that's the last time I stopped on purpose.
3814.0,3826.0," I mean, it was at the for the other times it was like, I think the last time we played, we hit like a terrible like actually game play bug, which is more than just like, crashing like was just that boss bug."
3826.0,3830.0," Yeah, it was a boss that like double spawned and then like."
3830.0,3831.0," Yeah, so tell people what happened."
3831.0,3833.0," See, you're out of this, the same thing happened in the middle."
3833.0,3836.0," I mean, it's around level eight or nine, I guess you're at."
3836.0,3841.0," So I'm in a voker. He's a guardian, so basically, Major tank if you're going to."
3841.0,3842.0, I'm sending anything else.
3842.0,3855.0," And, uh, we go into one of the story dungeons, I guess they're called because there's tons of like little sewer you can go in where there's just quest to kill, you know, ten aggregators and other fangs or whatever, but the demon aggregators."
3855.0,3857.0," So, they're going to do the museum."
3857.0,3859.0, They look shady too.
3859.0,3861.0, They look like it's very like from hell.
3861.0,3863.0," Jim Henson, he held though."
3863.0,3864.0, Yeah.
3864.0,3866.0," That's, that's okay with me."
3866.0,3868.0, I like Jim Henson.
3868.0,3872.0, That's the dark crystal.
3872.0,3874.0," Yeah, it was very dark."
3874.0,3875.0, Yeah.
3875.0,3886.0," So yeah, but then during the museum, there's a, there's a part where you go into the hell gate, like, yes it is, and then you come back out and then you're supposed to escape from the museum because you just."
3886.0,3888.0," It's boiler alert, I guess."
3888.0,3892.0," Blue up this part of hell with a bomb of some sort, but you understand."
3892.0,3896.0," So, and then the statues that have been standing that start coming to life, I guess."
3896.0,3900.0," I'm not entirely sure that's what's going on, but I thought they came back through the hell gate, but okay."
3900.0,3903.0," No, they look like the statues, so I'm assuming they're popping the light."
3903.0,3904.0," Oh, okay."
3904.0,3906.0, It's like too many of them spawned.
3906.0,3911.0, I played it and played this exact thing in single player and I had no trouble at all.
3911.0,3912.0, And then it doesn't.
3912.0,3915.0," Doesn't that kernel or general come through, general kernel."
3915.0,3917.0, This thing is named the neural goal car.
3917.0,3918.0, Who is he?
3918.0,3919.0, I'm real goal car or something.
3919.0,3921.0, But I had multiple emperor goal cars.
3921.0,3923.0, Carousel team.
3923.0,3927.0," But I had multiple spawn, we had multiple copies of this boss."
3927.0,3928.0, Yeah.
3928.0,3930.0, Multiple copies of I can't even just be called Chuck or something.
3930.0,3931.0, Spear.
3931.0,3932.0, And power.
3932.0,3933.0, Mitch.
3933.0,3934.0, And then it was just impossible.
3934.0,3939.0, Like we respawned and came back to the dungeon like 10 times.
3939.0,3940.0, Yeah.
3940.0,3941.0, Yeah.
3941.0,3946.0, Like they all got stuck in like vibrating in the same room together and you'd walk in and then they
3946.0,3948.0," still turned to you and go, oh, yeah."
3948.0,3949.0, Yeah.
3949.0,3951.0," And three seconds were like, what the hell is this?"
3951.0,3952.0, Yeah.
3952.0,3953.0, I had the same experience.
3953.0,3955.0, I was banging on whatever his name was.
3955.0,3956.0, Add more whatever.
3956.0,3958.0, And I killed him.
3958.0,3960.0, And then I still like from the back.
3960.0,3962.0, I just like was like taking damage and I turned around.
3962.0,3964.0, And their way there he was again.
3964.0,3966.0, And I knew this wasn't like a boss fight where he respawned.
3966.0,3970.0, This was actually like if this was how it's supposed to be.
3970.0,3972.0, And then they are some serious issues with this.
3972.0,3977.0, So you guys played this game and you're encountered messed up boss bugs.
3977.0,3981.0, You can't even understand what's going on with a story and it crashed a lot.
3981.0,3982.0, Yep.
3982.0,3983.0, You buy a second time.
3983.0,3984.0, More than that side from that stuff.
3984.0,3986.0, This is all happened in the multi-platform.
3986.0,3987.0, Like a multi-platform.
3987.0,3990.0, Like I played and like okay let's I mean that stuff's there.
3990.0,3991.0, And it's annoying.
3991.0,3992.0, I'm like looking beyond that.
3992.0,3995.0, I'm at least trying to say okay imagine they patched all of this today.
3995.0,3996.0, Right.
3996.0,3997.0, Right.
3997.0,3998.0, Yeah.
3998.0,4003.0, And my issues with it or the randomized levels are bad.
4003.0,4004.0, Just flat out bad.
4004.0,4008.0, And this is because as well as I'm going through the tiles.
4008.0,4013.0, Even but they're already bad to me before I got to the point where I was I stopped seeing new tilesets.
4013.0,4014.0, You know.
4014.0,4016.0, So what happened is I'm going through right now.
4016.0,4017.0, I'm a little drink there.
4017.0,4019.0, I'm going through the level.
4019.0,4022.0, And I see the same tile that the here it is again and there it is again.
4022.0,4027.0, And then I started asking myself like did I accidentally turn around when I was fighting one of these creatures.
4027.0,4028.0, And then I went back the way I came.
4028.0,4029.0, Yeah.
4029.0,4033.0, And then so like okay I'll press on to a new enemy spawn so I must go in the right way.
4033.0,4034.0, And I know what there is.
4034.0,4036.0, And then if some long thing.
4036.0,4038.0, It comes to just a dead end.
4038.0,4039.0, Right.
4039.0,4044.0, But like Sean and I told you the other day you know just in around the office like that's exactly what the Diablo levels did too.
4044.0,4045.0, That doesn't make them good though.
4045.0,4046.0, That's what I'll say.
4046.0,4047.0, Right.
4047.0,4048.0, Just because you it's the opposite.
4048.0,4049.0, The opposite.
4049.0,4050.0, The opposite.
4050.0,4053.0, Because it occupies a special place in your your rose.
4053.0,4054.0, Tenic memory.
4054.0,4055.0, That's not me.
4055.0,4056.0, Right.
4057.0,4059.0, I'm looking at it and I'm looking at it again.
4059.0,4060.0, See I'm looking at it again.
4060.0,4062.0, And again I'm looking at it again.
4062.0,4064.0, I'm looking at it again.
4064.0,4065.0, But then you said.
4065.0,4066.0, Yeah.
4066.0,4067.0, Same to that.
4067.0,4068.0, One of the fort.
4068.0,4073.0, And what if called did you get to the end of one of the levels is a dead end?
4073.0,4075.0, That's.
4075.0,4078.0, I'll tell you what the street's in how get reminded me of because as he do run down the long streets.
4078.0,4080.0, He's like seeing the same thing over and over.
4080.0,4084.0, Reminded me of the background's in the Flintstones like when they would be driving home.
4084.0,4085.0, Yeah.
4085.0,4085.84, even little games.
4085.84,4086.96, It's not as ashy.
4086.96,4087.8, Yeah.
4087.8,4091.04, And so it does bother me because it gives the game.
4091.04,4094.2, It doesn't have any kind of like charm or intensity to me.
4094.2,4097.04," And it's just like, and those being the opposite ends, you know,"
4097.04,4099.48, the spectrum or at least if it could be like super horrific.
4099.48,4101.08," And it's kind of just like,"
4101.08,4102.44, and these are boring.
4102.44,4106.48, But then the other thing I think is what matters
4106.48,4109.0," between Diablo and Helgate is that with Diablo,"
4109.0,4112.4," since it was fairly simplistic visual representation,"
4112.4,4114.76," it worked fine with the gameplay,"
4114.76,4116.24, which is really rude to Methree.
4116.24,4118.360000000001," But what happens now is that when you go and say,"
4118.360000000001,4120.92," let's try to compete with the other,"
4120.92,4124.360000000001," you know, visual tour de force games and bring this game up to speed,"
4124.360000000001,4125.76," put it in 3D and stuff,"
4125.76,4129.56, what it ends up doing is just underscoring
4129.56,4132.76, how just how rude to Methree to actual game systems are.
4132.76,4135.0," So that the combat, you know, when you're fighting someone,"
4135.0,4137.0," like I was saying, it looks completely ridiculous"
4137.0,4138.68, when they fall down.
4138.68,4141.12," It stands out to you that they're walking through objects,"
4141.12,4142.76," you know, that you're not using,"
4142.76,4144.8," that the objects that seem to be there,"
4144.8,4147.24," in physical parts of the environment that you use for cover,"
4147.24,4150.6," or just in obstruction that those don't necessarily matter,"
4150.6,4154.64," and that the way that every enemy just rushes you,"
4154.64,4156.320000000001," every enemy's tactic so far,"
4156.320000000001,4157.76," I mean, I only got to level A or 9,"
4157.76,4159.12, it's just to run directly at you.
4159.12,4161.68," So if you're a marksman, which is the class I play,"
4161.68,4163.52," and I play it in first person mode,"
4163.52,4166.320000000001, all the gameplay consists of running backwards
4166.320000000001,4169.52, while holding your fired button down and shooting them.
4169.52,4170.52, Right. Right.
4170.52,4173.240000000001, There are a few different enemy attacks for sure.
4173.240000000001,4175.8, There's the dude who kind of leap at you
4175.8,4177.64," from out of the sky and I mean,"
4177.64,4178.96, there's some different.
4178.96,4180.76," Yeah, jump and run."
4180.76,4181.8, It's jump and run at you.
4181.8,4183.4800000000005," Oh, jump on you, run on you."
4183.4800000000005,4184.4800000000005, Ah.
4184.4800000000005,4185.4800000000005, I don't know why.
4185.4800000000005,4186.6," There wasn't a lot of,"
4186.6,4187.6, ah.
4187.6,4191.200000000001, For at least the boss is being caught.
4191.200000000001,4193.120000000001, There wasn't a lot of different attacks.
4193.120000000001,4193.76, There's like different.
4193.76,4195.4400000000005," Yeah, there's different rates of movement."
4195.4400000000005,4197.8, There's one guy at the beginning who spawned like
4197.8,4200.160000000001," lots of little gooms or whatever,"
4200.16,4201.68," and they would chase you independently and he was like,"
4201.68,4204.04," oh, okay, so at least he released four worms to come after me."
4204.04,4205.96," But that was about the most interesting,"
4205.96,4207.5199999999995, I can remember for all the other bosses.
4207.5199999999995,4210.08," All the other named guys, we're just like,"
4210.08,4210.92, I have a name.
4210.92,4211.92, I'm bigger than you ever.
4211.92,4212.92, And I'm big to meet.
4212.92,4213.92, Yeah.
4213.92,4214.76, And I'm just going to come and hit you.
4214.76,4214.92, Right.
4214.92,4215.76, Run right at you.
4215.76,4219.5599999999995, And I was not found any reason to switch my load out to whatever.
4219.5599999999995,4222.2, I found that my one weapon does find no matter what I'm
4222.2,4222.5599999999995, killing.
4222.5599999999995,4224.32, I've not had to change strategies.
4224.32,4226.76," I've never had to, but I find entertaining to."
4226.76,4227.04, Yeah.
4227.04,4228.92," So with my marksman like for whatever,"
4228.92,4230.96," if I have one load out down to F3 key,"
4230.96,4233.12," and that would be a may palm rocket that's like an area,"
4233.12,4234.52, the effect thing on the floor.
4234.52,4236.68," And since you know everything's going to run at you,"
4236.68,4238.76," no matter what you do, you just shoot it at the ground"
4238.76,4240.64, in front of you as you back up and they'll run through it.
4240.64,4242.36, And it will like hurt them as they pass through it.
4242.36,4244.04," And then as they're passing through it,"
4244.04,4246.96, you've already switched with your F key to another load out.
4246.96,4250.04, And so maybe I have a pistol in a local
4250.04,4250.84, needle on turn off.
4250.84,4251.04, Yeah.
4251.04,4251.24, Yeah.
4251.24,4252.24, Come on with that.
4252.24,4254.24," For the character, I'm playing it very much like which toy do I"
4254.24,4256.8, want to play with now because they all seem to work.
4256.8,4257.0, Right.
4257.0,4260.0, But you're not doing it in reaction to what the game is
4260.0,4260.64, challenging.
4260.64,4260.84, Right.
4260.84,4262.84, It's just like this right now I want to use this and this.
4262.84,4263.84, Yeah.
4263.84,4267.4, I was thinking like if all of a sudden the Ablow 3
4267.4,4269.84, came out and it was the same gameplay as the Ablow.
4269.84,4272.28," It was pretty much hellgate, but like even more polished."
4272.28,4272.96, Yeah.
4272.96,4274.12, I think I'd be disappointed too.
4274.12,4276.08, I would expect them to do.
4276.08,4278.8," If this was the best gameplay, I would say that this was"
4278.8,4282.68, Diablo 3 and it's funny because this is the Diablo 1 and 2 guys.
4282.68,4285.72," If this was, if they called this Diablo 3,"
4285.72,4289.4400000000005, I would think that this frankly was a fucking catastrophe.
4289.4400000000005,4293.76, I think everyone part of it's just why they haven't done Diablo 3.
4293.76,4296.92, The possibility of living up to your expectations.
4296.92,4297.92, Right.
4297.92,4299.04, But it's beyond that.
4299.04,4300.400000000001, It is the technical stuff.
4300.400000000001,4301.400000000001, You can't.
4301.400000000001,4304.52," I mean, yes, at some point they are going to pass this up and it'll be fine"
4304.52,4305.88, and these will be distant memories.
4305.88,4309.320000000001, But some of this stuff is unbelievable how bad it is right now.
4309.320000000001,4311.08, And there's simply no excuse for it.
4311.08,4314.64," I've been going, I've gone through levels and multiplayer,"
4314.72,4319.04," you know, slog through some entire freaking, you know, street,"
4319.04,4320.52, mode down every single person.
4320.52,4324.68," I get to the portal I need to get to, to get to that to the next part of the story."
4324.68,4326.88, Only to find out that the portal's not open.
4326.88,4327.240000000001, Right.
4327.240000000001,4329.04, Basically just because of a glitch.
4329.04,4332.8," So I have to, you know, I have to log out of the game and log back in."
4332.8,4335.360000000001, And then I have to clear that whole goddamn thing again.
4335.360000000001,4336.72," I think you know, you should play."
4336.72,4339.0," I know Sean's been playing it, but I think you should play Tabulara."
4339.0,4340.64, So because it's almost the same game.
4340.64,4341.4400000000005, It really is.
4341.4400000000005,4344.320000000001," Except with worlds that are designed for, you know,"
4344.4,4347.4," maximum variety with instances that are like,"
4347.4,4351.759999999999," very, you know, very well put together and have the variety with characters that you can basically"
4351.759999999999,4353.28, re-roll anytime you want.
4353.28,4353.639999999999, Okay.
4353.639999999999,4356.639999999999, Now there's another big problem that thank you for reminding me.
4356.639999999999,4360.48," The lack of a respect in this game is,"
4360.48,4366.08," seriously, it's just unbelievable to me that they would make a mistake that bad."
4366.08,4368.599999999999," And I believe that they've, they've said,"
4368.599999999999,4369.599999999999," why, right?"
4369.599999999999,4373.759999999999, So I can't believe that that reason is anything remotely intelligent.
4373.84,4374.6, What was that?
4375.84,4377.52," To be this reason that they said,"
4377.52,4379.76," well, I don't, I don't want to put words into their mouth."
4379.76,4381.280000000001, So I'll have to go back and see it.
4381.280000000001,4383.4400000000005, But I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't like.
4383.4400000000005,4384.12, I can't.
4384.12,4387.72, And that's to get you to replay their game over and over again.
4387.72,4388.4800000000005," Well, right."
4388.4800000000005,4388.96, Sure.
4388.96,4391.84, But any reason that would actually make any sense to it to a game.
4391.84,4392.4800000000005, Exactly.
4392.4800000000005,4393.12," Well, why, why don't you?"
4393.12,4394.400000000001," I'm having is even like,"
4394.400000000001,4395.12, that's it was a good one.
4395.12,4397.76," When I looked, when I looked down my tree,"
4397.76,4401.52," like even with the upload, you could kind of go to the bottom and pick out,"
4401.52,4404.0," like, okay, that skill is something that really wants to do."
4404.0,4404.4800000000005, Right. Right.
4404.4800000000005,4405.76, I'm looking at this tree.
4405.76,4407.6," And it's like, you know,"
4407.6,4410.240000000001, got all sorts of branches and go down to the bottom of all of them.
4410.240000000001,4412.64," And I'm like, yeah, they all look like you're there."
4412.64,4414.96," And you get them, they suck and you're stuck with them."
4414.96,4415.280000000001, Yeah.
4415.280000000001,4417.52," Like the grenade, you get, you throw it."
4417.52,4420.320000000001," And instead of lobbying a grenade in a reasonable arc,"
4420.320000000001,4422.96," so you can, you know, into it where it will land."
4422.96,4426.320000000001," So that that way, then you get used to dropping them in groups of enemies."
4426.320000000001,4429.92," It's like, you shoot the thing, like the goddamn Saturn rocket,"
4429.92,4432.16, and it just goes to the end of the map and blows up.
4432.16,4432.4800000000005, Right.
4432.4800000000005,4433.36, You won't stop when it hits.
4433.36,4437.04," And you can't, and you can't entirely dumb and useless and I hate it."
4437.04,4438.08, And you can't hate it.
4438.08,4439.28, And you can't get out of it.
4439.28,4442.32," You can't, I mean, charge me a million dollars in, but let me respect."
4442.32,4444.64," Oh, let me get rid of that one."
4444.64,4445.52," Sure, you're penny dude."
4445.52,4446.0," Well, right."
4446.0,4446.4800000000005, Credit.
4446.4800000000005,4448.4800000000005, Let me call cash call and reset.
4448.4800000000005,4451.04," Whatever it is, give you, give you another chance with that."
4451.04,4453.04, Having a completely re-roll your character.
4453.04,4453.36, Yeah.
4453.36,4454.24, Which is a joke.
4454.24,4457.12," Is there a way, maybe I'm just missing it because I haven't been paying attention"
4457.12,4458.88, because the game isn't that difficult.
4458.96,4459.76, Yeah.
4459.76,4464.56, Is there any reason to use the different like elements basically?
4464.56,4467.92, Because I have like a fire gun and I have a touch zone and I have a spectral gun.
4467.92,4469.36," Well, I haven't had a real idea either."
4469.36,4469.52, Yeah.
4469.52,4470.32, Maybe I'm not far enough.
4470.32,4471.52, Maybe resistance is a real good.
4471.52,4473.6, I suppose you'll get to the part where it becomes difficult.
4473.6,4474.72," I mean, I'm sure you think the same."
4474.72,4479.6, It'll get difficult enough at a point where then they really start to go for these like
4479.6,4481.36, heterogeneous groupings of enemies.
4481.36,4481.84, Yeah.
4481.84,4486.72, And then you have to shift between your buildups to know if you're getting well.
4486.96,4487.360000000001, Yeah.
4487.360000000001,4489.68, The lack of information is another thing.
4489.68,4492.0," I mean, I was complaining to you the other day about,"
4492.0,4493.76," you know, because I have a subscription."
4493.76,4498.56," And so it's dropping, dropping like subscriber only items, which is,"
4498.56,4500.56," which is another, you know, whatever."
4500.56,4502.72, I want to go down that road if you want.
4502.72,4506.56," But you know, so things are dropping in the world like potatoes,"
4506.56,4508.240000000001," things like that, apples."
4508.240000000001,4511.4400000000005," And it turns out that you use those things in recipes, right?"
4511.4400000000005,4514.16," But it doesn't really tell you, there's not enough information."
4514.16,4516.8," It doesn't give you, doesn't tell you what an apple is."
4516.8,4519.5199999999995," So, you know, so I got an apple and I ate it."
4519.5199999999995,4521.28," Because, you know, it's an apple."
4521.28,4522.0, Maybe that's what it does.
4522.0,4523.28, But it didn't do anything for me.
4523.28,4525.68," So then I learned later when I found some recipes,"
4525.68,4528.48," it dropped some subscriber only recipes that,"
4528.48,4530.72," oh, one of the ingredients is apple."
4530.72,4531.36," So, okay."
4531.36,4534.0, So now I'm going to stop eating these apples that I didn't know what they did.
4534.0,4537.44," Anyway, I'll put them in the recipe for this toffee thing I can make now."
4537.44,4540.4, So then I eat the toffee thing and I don't know what that does.
4540.4,4542.16, What did I make a recipe?
4542.16,4543.12, Tell me.
4543.28,4544.88," Plus two health, whatever."
4544.88,4545.36, Yeah.
4545.36,4548.48," Right. I mean, it's just rudimentary information that the game,"
4548.48,4552.0, black crafting is always the same thing in games.
4552.0,4555.44," Like, it was not always, but it wasn't auto assault."
4555.44,4557.68," And it was like, it wasn't implemented in tabular assault."
4557.68,4559.36, It was playing that in the beta.
4559.36,4560.8, But it always seems like the one thing.
4560.8,4562.96," And then even in, and when I play the how-gate,"
4562.96,4565.28," you know, you just assume, well, at some point,"
4565.28,4567.92, I'll have enough crap to make something that might be useful.
4567.92,4568.32, Uh-huh.
4568.32,4570.64," But yeah, the crafting is always something that I think,"
4570.64,4572.8," I think, loud as crafting pretty well."
4572.88,4573.76, Make it clear.
4573.76,4578.16," It just kind of says, you will craft something that gives you 50 health."
4578.16,4578.88, Yeah.
4578.88,4579.28, Great.
4579.28,4580.64," Oh, perfect. Got it."
4580.64,4582.4800000000005, Right. Tell me what it does.
4582.4800000000005,4585.04, And then it doesn't have all these extra barriers.
4585.04,4587.68," We're like, once you get the items, it's like, oh,"
4587.68,4591.2," well, you need to get the crafting lesson from this guy at the craft center."
4591.2,4592.4800000000005, And then you get the crafting center.
4592.4800000000005,4593.28, You get this lesson.
4593.28,4596.16, There's a way you need to upgrade this crafting lesson that you got.
4596.16,4598.16," And you're like, by that point,"
4598.16,4600.8, that's why I always give up in the few of them as a play with the crafting.
4600.8,4602.4800000000005," It's like, come on, do you fuck this shit?"
4602.48,4604.5599999999995, Give me some gratification right up front.
4604.5599999999995,4606.48," You know, did you play Lord of the Rings online?"
4606.48,4608.959999999999, A little bit. And I never got to the point where I was crafting.
4609.5199999999995,4611.28, That's exactly what you're describing.
4611.28,4611.919999999999, Yeah.
4611.919999999999,4616.4," It was, it was, the crafting in that game would drive you insane."
4616.4,4616.879999999999, Really?
4616.879999999999,4618.48, Because it's exactly what you just described.
4618.48,4619.44," Yeah, it sucks."
4619.44,4620.08, That's dull.
4620.08,4620.719999999999, I hate it.
4620.719999999999,4624.24, And you couldn't get all the materials within your own profession.
4624.959999999999,4625.5199999999995," Bro, right."
4625.5199999999995,4627.44," For the rest of the past, you needed the Lord of the Rings."
4627.44,4630.08, So you would have to like get them from other players' list of.
4630.08,4631.04," Like, there's farming."
4631.68,4633.5199999999995, You ought to go by the seed and crap.
4633.5199999999995,4636.48, And you gotta go find a field and then plant the seeds.
4636.48,4638.96, It better be some of the good stuff you get for this.
4638.96,4640.48, And then you get some onions.
4640.48,4642.32, And then you have to do some stuff with the onions
4642.32,4644.08, and make them into like edible onions.
4644.08,4645.5199999999995, And then you got a like cook them.
4646.48,4648.16," Meanwhile, your life is ticking by."
4649.2,4650.72," Yeah, that's good."
4650.72,4652.64, I could order Taco Bell at that time.
4652.64,4655.6, And I do agree with you about the randomization of the levels.
4655.6,4659.04," I think it, it just kind of just doesn't work anymore."
4659.04,4663.04," I mean, when you compare it to a game that looks as great as something."
4663.04,4665.84," I tighten Quest, which is basically the exact same kind of game."
4666.24,4668.48, But every single level is beautiful looking.
4668.48,4670.24," If you go to a dead end and tighten Quest,"
4670.24,4672.8," maybe you have this like this store, you're up on a hilltop,"
4672.8,4674.8, and you look down at a valley below or something.
4674.8,4675.84, There's a summer award.
4675.84,4677.28, It's not just like a chest.
4677.28,4677.84," Well, right."
4677.84,4679.68," It would yield like a big, you would know,"
4679.68,4681.12," okay, if I go to this out of the way,"
4681.12,4683.04, place they're going to have something they're forming.
4683.04,4683.28, Right.
4683.28,4684.72," That's going to be randomized though, right?"
4684.72,4686.08," No, it's what I'm saying."
4686.08,4686.48, Yeah.
4686.48,4688.88, People bitched about the fact that it wasn't randomized.
4688.96,4689.84, Which made no sense to it.
4689.84,4690.32, Yeah.
4690.32,4693.2," It's like, I'm definitely now in the like make randomization."
4693.2,4695.6," It's like in the oblo, it was cool because you're like,"
4695.6,4696.72," oh cool, random."
4696.72,4699.6, So you could play this forever and it was fine back then.
4699.6,4701.2, Back then 900 years ago.
4701.2,4702.0, Uh-huh.
4702.0,4704.0," And I think Sean sort of right then,"
4704.0,4706.96," like the isometric perspective and the, you know,"
4706.96,4710.24," it was, it lent itself to randomization more."
4710.24,4712.4800000000005," I mean, here it does sort of point out the flaws."
4712.4800000000005,4716.88, And maybe there's some way you can come up with an algorithm that like mixes randomization with
4717.52,4718.32, some design.
4718.32,4718.96, Yeah.
4718.96,4719.84, This isn't it.
4719.84,4724.4800000000005," It does really get, you know, as much as I like the game at the beginning and I really did."
4724.4800000000005,4725.36, And I still like it.
4725.36,4726.32, It's still on my hard desk.
4726.32,4727.52, Still still still one time.
4727.52,4728.72," Yeah, I still want to play it."
4728.72,4732.16, I'm not going to uninstall because I'm hoping that with the patches I'll fix stuff.
4732.16,4737.36," But, but it does get to be a little wearing to enter, you know, the next new zone,"
4737.92,4741.68," you know, the next new part of London and have it look exactly the same as every other."
4741.68,4741.92, Yeah.
4741.92,4744.8," It's like, oh my god, you guys needed to do something different."
4744.88,4749.04," So the point where you even know, like saying the London tiles at right, there's the, the broken building."
4749.04,4749.4400000000005, Yeah.
4749.4400000000005,4752.400000000001," On the left side, you know, down there, there's like a burning trash can."
4752.400000000001,4754.400000000001, But it's like just this pit that's always there.
4754.400000000001,4754.56, Yeah.
4754.56,4757.04, Sometimes there's a zombie in there and sometimes there's not.
4757.04,4758.64, It's like you see it over and over again.
4758.64,4758.96, Yeah.
4758.96,4763.4400000000005, One of the dungeon tile sets where there's this walkway that kind of goes up on the left.
4763.4400000000005,4765.84, Like it's going to lead you to some other upstairs area.
4765.84,4768.320000000001," But it's just this platform that does, it's just nothing."
4768.320000000001,4768.8, Yeah.
4768.8,4770.24, And that one over and over.
4770.24,4771.28," Like what, what is that?"
4771.28,4771.76, Yeah.
4771.76,4773.76, What does that even the game need at a lot more work?
4773.84,4779.52," And games have proven that it's possible to create just a vast, rich amount of content that is"
4779.52,4780.72, specifically designed.
4780.72,4781.52, Yeah.
4781.52,4783.2, And the world of work have proved that.
4783.2,4783.52, Right.
4783.52,4785.52, And there's nothing random in any of the dungeon.
4785.52,4786.52, Yeah.
4786.52,4787.52, Right.
4787.52,4788.52, And we got so true.
4788.52,4790.0, They could have made and place rocks for God's sake.
4790.0,4791.0, Right.
4791.0,4792.4800000000005," I think this, yeah, these sorts of games."
4792.4800000000005,4794.96," I mean, I guess you're saying that world of work crafts an exception."
4794.96,4798.400000000001," But I mean, it's just the whole quantity over quality thing."
4798.400000000001,4799.400000000001, Right.
4799.400000000001,4802.400000000001, Like let's find a way to give you to keep you playing this game as long as you can.
4802.4,4805.96," The problem for me is that if the quality's not good enough can't be playing, the quantities"
4805.96,4807.04, never going to do it.
4807.04,4810.839999999999," Because some people like you guys really do, I'm not saying you will with this game."
4810.839999999999,4817.44, But I know some people are more interested in what I call collective mania or just complete
4817.44,4819.16,ism and getting every little thing.
4819.16,4821.719999999999, And I find that stuff easy to like overlook.
4821.719999999999,4823.44, I can just just grab me that way.
4823.44,4825.4, So I do have that part of my personality.
4825.4,4826.4, And I do too.
4826.4,4827.4, Yeah.
4827.4,4828.4, Which is why it's still on my hard desk.
4828.4,4830.719999999999, And I'm hoping it will get better.
4830.76,4834.96," I mean, I want to give, I keep giving it to benefit of the doubt, but there's such"
4834.96,4836.360000000001, annoying things about it.
4836.360000000001,4839.64, And it's just really disappointment this release.
4839.64,4842.4400000000005," I wonder, it kind of goes with your personalities too."
4842.4400000000005,4843.4400000000005," I mean, do you guys hold stuff?"
4843.4400000000005,4847.16, Because it's like now and then I'll collect one sort of thing or another.
4847.16,4850.320000000001," But for the most part, my whole life, I just moved all the time."
4850.320000000001,4851.56, So I get rid of stuff.
4851.56,4855.84," Like I don't have any, like, I mean, if I had kept everything, I'd have every console"
4855.84,4860.12," in existence, you know, from, you know, Vetrex and to various, you know, Atari versions"
4860.12,4862.04, and televisions and so on and so forth.
4862.04,4863.2, But I don't have any that.
4863.2,4867.12, I have about like 10 console games at any point ever in my collection.
4867.12,4870.08," And it's like, I just, if I'm done, I'm done."
4870.08,4871.08, I'm moving on the harder.
4871.08,4875.76," It's up and else, you know, I have got all my records gone back for forever."
4875.76,4879.32," CDs, books."
4879.32,4880.72, It was comic books for a while.
4880.72,4882.52, How do you manage to keep all of your books?
4882.52,4883.76, Do you have a big house?
4883.76,4885.360000000001," I have a, are you sleep underneath?"
4885.36,4889.32," No, I have a fairly big house, but like we have bookcases like in our bathroom, literally,"
4889.32,4890.32, because we have so many books.
4890.32,4891.32, Yeah.
4891.32,4892.32, Life and I.
4892.32,4893.32, That's another thing.
4893.32,4894.32, I guess I've run a via new bookshelf.
4894.32,4897.5599999999995," Yeah, I just trade constantly, cycle books in the same way."
4897.5599999999995,4898.5599999999995, I would console games.
4898.5599999999995,4900.44," You know, we can go to like a store and trade them in."
4900.44,4902.44," It's like we got in Pegasus, Berkeley, right?"
4902.44,4903.44, Right.
4903.44,4904.92, Read five books and then take those in.
4904.92,4909.44," We will do a purge of the house every couple years and go down to, to a use bookstores"
4909.44,4912.44, and sell them or to the library and donate them.
4912.44,4915.32," But, but for the most part, I keep them all."
4915.32,4917.0, What about just dumb random crafts?
4917.0,4921.44," Like all the stuff you get sent for games like Little, uh, shit."
4921.44,4923.24, Little Peter's statues and stuff.
4923.24,4924.24, You got got all of them.
4924.24,4926.92, I'm basically asking if home I'd be like your artist.
4926.92,4928.92," No, I wouldn't be very too."
4928.92,4930.32, If I did that shit.
4930.32,4933.32, It's all stuff I choose to keep.
4933.32,4934.32, Yeah.
4934.32,4936.96, I have 14 consoles hooked up to my TV right now.
4936.96,4937.96, Are you serious?
4937.96,4938.96, Yes.
4938.96,4940.2, All hooked up at the same time.
4940.2,4941.2, How do you do that?
4941.2,4943.4," There's a couple that are probably just like sitting in the,"
4943.4,4944.92," wait, they're actually hooked up."
4944.92,4945.92, Yes.

4949.36,4951.04, And two splitter boxes.
4951.04,4953.72, You've got to take a photo of this and put it online.
4953.72,4954.72, Can you do that?
4954.72,4955.96," I probably could, yeah."
4955.96,4956.96, Wow.
4956.96,4957.96, So what are they?
4957.96,4961.0," How often do you play any, any given one of this 14?"
4961.0,4962.84, This is why you haven't played Diablo on PC.

4989.0,4990.0, now sounds like I'm shilling for him.
4990.0,4994.0," But I mean, the concept of that kind of downloadable content that you delete and"
4994.0,4998.0," write, return to your hard drive when you want it's perfect because I don't have"
4998.0,4999.0, this cool.

5167.0,5168.0, Like the whole back.
5168.0,5169.0, He's box.
5169.0,5170.0, No.
5170.0,5171.0, My comic collection.
5171.0,5172.0, I've a beat.
5172.0,5173.0, Yeah.
5173.0,5174.0, My short box.
5174.0,5177.0, This doesn't count on the graphic novels that I'm writing bookshelf.
5177.0,5179.0, I don't have the graphic novels.
5179.0,5180.0, No.
5180.0,5183.0," Well, I have a whole bunch of I'm a bigger loser."
5183.0,5184.0, I'm a bigger loser.
5184.0,5185.0, Or you're trying to get rid of these like a couple of ones.
5185.0,5186.0, I was.
5186.0,5187.0, I almost sold them all.
5187.0,5189.0, Which is just get rid of like every time I move.
5189.0,5190.0, I had them up on Greg's list.
5190.0,5193.0, The box is like out in the apartments or in the neighborhood.
5193.0,5196.0, I've thought of that with like the shitty ones that I'm embarrassed that bought.
5196.0,5197.0, But then.
5197.0,5198.0, It's a story.
5198.0,5199.0, Yeah.
5199.0,5202.0," I take that shit into a store and you come into a comic store and you're like,"
5202.0,5206.0," Hey, I want to trade these in and then they're like, look at your own."
5206.0,5208.0," They're like, we don't want this."
5208.0,5209.0," Or they're like, we can give you two bucks."
5209.0,5212.0, And then like it even gets worse when you sit there and hang with them.
5212.0,5213.0," Oh, come on man."
5213.0,5214.0, Can't you make that three?
5214.0,5215.0, Which makes that 350?
5215.0,5219.0," You got like, you know, eight years worth of books."
5219.0,5220.0, 600 pounds of box.
5220.0,5225.0, That's like when I sold my old like Chicago and stick records and shit like that.
5225.0,5226.0, Yeah.
5226.0,5227.0, Yeah.
5227.0,5228.0, That's what you're selling with.
5228.0,5229.0, That's what you're selling with.
5229.0,5230.0, Right.
5230.0,5231.0," Let it go, dude."
5231.0,5232.0, You'll live it.
5232.0,5233.0, Go.
5233.0,5235.0, You live a free or happier life without that shit.
5235.0,5236.0, Without your clutter.
5236.0,5237.0, Yeah.
5237.0,5238.0, Yeah.
5238.0,5239.0, Talk about my dirt.
5239.0,5240.0, So what?
5240.0,5241.0," Oh, we have more games."
5241.0,5242.0, We got plenty more games.
5242.0,5243.0, Holy shit.
5243.0,5244.0, What talent?
5244.0,5245.0," Let's, let's take a break."
5245.0,5246.0, We already took one.
5246.0,5248.0, Let me talk about crisis a little bit right now then.
5248.0,5250.0," And then I know you played the Witcher, but I won't talk about crisis."
5250.0,5253.0, Because obviously the review just came out today.
5253.0,5254.0, Okay.
5254.0,5255.0," How you doing there, Sean?"
5255.0,5256.0, You made it right.
5256.0,5257.0, I'm just going to do that.
5257.0,5258.0, I'm just going to do that.
5258.0,5259.0, Okay.
5259.0,5260.0, Yeah.
5260.0,5261.0, We do have a magazine to put out.
5261.0,5262.0, Yeah.
5262.0,5264.0," But we got, we got to talk about crisis."
5264.0,5265.0, We have crisis in Witcher.
5265.0,5266.0, Was that it?
5266.0,5268.0," I think we, and we're good to go."
5268.0,5269.0, Okay.
5269.0,5270.0, Okay.
5270.0,5271.0, So tell us about crisis.
5271.0,5272.0, One third view.
5272.0,5274.0, Just went up today on that.
5274.0,5275.0, I hear you hated it.
5275.0,5276.0," Oh, yeah."
5276.0,5277.0, I did.
5277.0,5278.0, Why'd you only give it an eight?
5278.0,5279.0, Oh.
5279.0,5280.0, Why'd you score it so low?
5280.0,5284.0," You know, today coming before when I was looking online before we came in here,"
5284.0,5285.0, I was seriously thinking of myself.
5285.0,5289.0," And then Robert Ashley, who, you know, was on the show sometimes by AKA Bob Edo, Max"
5289.0,5294.0," Shell was reminding me that he doesn't write reviews and part, you know, part for this sort of"
5294.0,5295.0, reason.
5295.0,5297.0," It's like, it's, it's not with your time, you know."
5297.0,5300.0, But it's one of those things where I'm looking at it.
5300.0,5304.0," And now and then, you know, what I said earlier to Ryan, okay, Mr. Rogers at least knew"
5304.0,5307.0," that his audience was in diapers, right?"
5307.0,5309.0," So he, he would know."
5309.0,5311.0, He would do what he did in that knowledge.
5311.0,5314.0," But for me now and then, you know, it's like, I want to do something different."
5314.0,5318.0," And then it's like, I find out that my audience is in diapers."
5318.0,5319.0, You just have to remember.
5319.0,5320.0, And I'm not saying that every time.
5320.0,5324.0," This isn't like again, like, don't even let this be like everyone sucks."
5324.0,5325.0," And it, because it didn't, it would be me."
5325.0,5330.0," But I'm talking about specific people, the kind who posted like the story at a"
5330.0,5334.0," Voodoo, extremer, whatever that the headline was,"
5334.0,5336.0, one up gets sloppy seconds.
5336.0,5340.0, And then the sloppy seconds is hyperlink to some other review that must have come out
5340.0,5343.0, of you hours earlier or something.
5343.0,5344.0, Eight out of ten.
5344.0,5346.0, Why so low?
5346.0,5347.0," I mean, fuck you, dude."
5347.0,5349.0," Hey, whoever wrote that seriously, fuck you."
5349.0,5350.0, Yeah.
5350.0,5351.0, You're a piece of shit.
5351.0,5354.0," Because if you, I mean, that's, no, I'm dead serious."
5354.0,5355.0," You are, I know you're serious."
5355.0,5358.0," I never have said, you can eat a dick because,"
5358.0,5359.0, here's why.
5359.0,5363.0," And it makes me so upset because for me, when I put an eight on a score,"
5363.0,5367.0," I'm very seriously saying, this is a damn fine game."
5367.0,5369.0, And I believe that you should play it.
5369.0,5373.0," And part of the reason is, of course, everyone uses different scales."
5373.0,5375.0," We talked about it before, so I won't try to like,"
5375.0,5377.0, retail that entire story.
5377.0,5380.0," But in my mind, and I can't wait to speak for myself,"
5380.0,5382.0, I want to use the entire scale.
5382.0,5383.0, That means one through ten.
5383.0,5385.0, And every single one of those is a viable option.
5385.0,5388.0, Not this blurry area where six and seven are the same.
5388.0,5389.0, We're eight nine are the same.
5389.0,5392.0, We're two and five are more or less the same.
5392.0,5396.0," Or where, or any kind of world where an eight is low."
5396.0,5397.0, Yep.
5397.0,5398.0, Right.
5398.0,5402.0," And the other part of this that, that is so frustrating to me is that, again,"
5402.0,5403.0, people see the score.
5403.0,5406.0," The first thing they look at, the only thing they want to argue about."
5406.0,5411.0, And it changes the way that they interpret every other bit of information in the review.
5411.0,5414.0," Whereas we want to say, well, we can't have our way, apparently,"
5414.0,5415.0, especially online.
5415.0,5418.0," I mean, I'm sure for GFW magazine readers, I love you."
5418.0,5420.0, You guys clearly get it in the mail we get from you guys and stuff.
5420.0,5422.0," But it's like, here's a review."
5422.0,5426.0," And here's a score to go with it as a little additional piece of like,"
5426.0,5430.0," you know, think about it this way, you know, if we had to put the score and here's the score."
5430.0,5436.0," So they conduct this sort of linguistic sentence calculus arithmetic where they say,"
5436.0,5441.0," the assumption is any game that's been hyped throughout the year to any,"
5441.0,5444.0," you know, significant degree of which crisis is one,"
5444.0,5446.0," games like oblivion, games like years of war."
5446.0,5449.0," You know, the games that we get all excited about and talk about."
5449.0,5451.0, The assumption is that they should all get a 10.
5451.0,5455.0," And that means then that any negative thing you say in your review,"
5455.0,5460.0," must be one of the reasons, must be where you can isolate where the points are missing."
5460.0,5465.0," So say, for example, if it's an eighth of the game, you dot two points off it for something."
5465.0,5467.0, And we can find these by finding the negative things.
5467.0,5470.0," So if you then said two negative things in your entire review,"
5470.0,5476.0, that mean that that must mean that each of those is responsible for moving a single point.
5476.0,5478.0, And the score of 10 that it deserved.
5478.0,5479.0, I'm with that.
5479.0,5482.0, And that's why you're saying that's not out to me.
5482.0,5484.0," I mean, this is just completely, I'm upset."
5484.0,5485.0, I'm upset.
5485.0,5489.0," I mean, it's just like, this rotten absolutely faulty thinking."
5489.0,5492.0," And it doesn't work that way, right?"
5492.0,5494.0," I mean, it's not like every good thing you say."
5494.0,5495.0," I mean, it doesn't even make sense."
5495.0,5496.0, No matter how you try to slice it.
5496.0,5497.0, So that's dead wrong.
5497.0,5501.0," And some of the frustrating things that that's led to is someone's like,"
5501.0,5505.0," I commented that, you know, the dialogue and narrative,"
5505.0,5507.0," especially toward the end of the game when they become,"
5507.0,5510.0," when they figure more prominently in the story,"
5510.0,5511.0, are bad.
5512.0,5515.0," But so people said, oh, he docked a point because the dialogue's bad."
5515.0,5520.0," He, this piece of shit doesn't understand that a game doesn't have to have a story to be good."
5520.0,5521.0," It was like, oh, my bad."
5521.0,5524.0," I thought it was saying that the beginning of the game had like,"
5524.0,5526.0, fuck off for a story was absolutely phenomenal.
5526.0,5527.0, Right.
5527.0,5530.0," And then when it gets to the point where it tries to shoe harness story in,"
5530.0,5533.0," and it screws up the gameplay, it starts to suck."
5533.0,5536.0," You know, any other number of things."
5536.0,5538.0," And then, you know, I shouldn't even read it."
5538.0,5540.0, I should not read it because of my shit.
5540.0,5542.0," And then, as long as the other comments are read,"
5542.0,5546.0," Ryan or some other person at one off decided to make,"
5546.0,5547.0, because I didn't write it.
5547.0,5550.0, They decided to make my reviewer biography.
5550.0,5551.0, Okay.
5551.0,5553.0, I paid a pretty picture of me.
5553.0,5556.0, And it lists like all my favorite games as Naruto.
5556.0,5558.0," So every game that I like, it's gotten Naruto."
5558.0,5560.0, And the task is you didn't turn your text in.
5560.0,5561.0, So we had to write it for you.
5561.0,5563.0," And people are like, online,"
5563.0,5566.0, this is the worst review since never winter nights too.
5566.0,5568.0, It has to be pulled.
5568.0,5571.0," Well, because it says you like Naruto."
5571.0,5572.0, Yes.
5572.0,5575.0," They're like, this guy should not touch an FPS."
5575.0,5578.0, He just likes Naruto games.
5578.0,5579.0," And then, of course, everything else."
5579.0,5582.0," He's like, this and that and the other things are applied to say."
5582.0,5584.0, And it's just mind blowing.
5584.0,5586.0," I mean, I can't expect that's our fault."
5586.0,5588.0, You put a joke that I don't know.
5588.0,5590.0, That's why I don't think you guys should have done that.
5590.0,5592.0," No, but it's like I disagree with you."
5592.0,5596.0," If people couldn't see read that for me when see that that was a joke,"
5596.0,5598.0, then they're morons.
5598.0,5600.0, You should not be worrying about these people.
5600.0,5602.0, And then the other things that happen.
5602.0,5604.0," It's like, I mean, that's the main thing."
5604.0,5606.0," And eight, and you see all these people posting like,"
5606.0,5608.0," Oh, I'll still play it."
5608.0,5609.0, I'll still try it.
5609.0,5611.0," And I'm like, even though I got to measly."
5611.0,5613.0," Seriously, oh, my God."
5613.0,5615.0," I wrote the eighth saying like,"
5615.0,5616.0, you should play this game.
5616.0,5618.0, If you're even interested in the first person shooter.
5618.0,5620.0," And again, I said, oh, so I'm going up."
5620.0,5621.0, You're a game review.
5621.0,5622.0, It was unequivocally positive.
5622.0,5623.0, I read this review.
5623.0,5624.0," And then, and then, and then,"
5625.0,5628.0," And it's quite a way of thought of the context so that the whole point with their views,"
5628.0,5633.0," you know, I used one of the Chavat yearly CEO of CriTex,"
5633.0,5637.0, Metaphores for his game to create a theme for the story.
5637.0,5640.0," And then by doing that, what I wanted to do was establish."
5640.0,5642.0," How the game was working, establish, you know,"
5642.0,5644.0," all the things that are supposed to be and what it,"
5644.0,5645.0, by and large is.
5645.0,5648.0," And then when you have this framework, when you get to point instead of saying,"
5648.0,5651.0," they guys great, but sometimes it's not or whatever."
5651.0,5653.0, And then just getting here's the graphics here's the audio like.
5653.0,5658.0," That when you get to the part where things aren't necessarily impressive to me,"
5658.0,5661.0," it's now situated in this context of like,"
5661.0,5664.0, here's all the things that are going right and the ways that's going right.
5664.0,5667.0, And so it now it's like doubly upsetting when these things have.
5667.0,5668.0, Right.
5668.0,5671.0, And then here's basically the thing with the game.
5671.0,5674.0," Some of the stuff in the beginning, you know,"
5674.0,5675.0, the majority of the game.
5675.0,5677.0, The first three quarters of the game is just incredible.
5677.0,5679.0," I've said that before in the one of the show,"
5679.0,5682.0," I've said that if you like FPS is, it's a no-brainer going get it."
5682.0,5685.0, Provided you have this system to play it.
5685.0,5687.0, And it'll make you look.
5687.0,5690.0," I mean, I've mentioned how it's made me look at COD differently."
5690.0,5693.0, It'll make you look at all the other shooters you play differently.
5693.0,5697.0," You'll at least want to say, well, how did crisis handle that or whatever."
5697.0,5702.0," You know, they've at least, they've shown you what option that there are more options out there for designers"
5702.0,5705.0," than a lot of people acknowledge, you know."
5705.0,5710.0," And then so because of it, and it establishes all the stuff and it's as you're playing,"
5710.0,5716.0, you're becoming more and more comfortable with the way that the game works and you're doing your experimenting and you're having more fun.
5716.0,5723.0," And then all of a sudden it gets to this point where it wasn't just that it becomes linear where it had been,"
5723.0,5730.0," you know, systemic, procedural, wide open where it just become scripted and narrow and all the stuff that was a shock,"
5730.0,5737.0," which it was, but it became, but it's not, but it's awesome specifically that it's poor scripting."
5737.0,5740.0, It's not like COD for quality linear stuff.
5740.0,5747.0," It's just like kind of lousy, you know, like what I was talking about for the beginning of Area 51."
5747.0,5755.0," And why it was so frustrating to me is because you could still see the potential and then, you know, here's some spoilers in this,"
5755.0,5760.0," but after you do, just do all these phenomenal things where you're fighting helicopters, you're hiding from them,"
5760.0,5766.0," they're falling through the trees, you're running and getting in a boat crossing the lakes, sniping someone, getting in a tank."
5767.0,5773.0," Then, you know, you have these situations where you're escorting someone, if he dies, you die, then you're getting a Jeep."
5773.0,5780.0," You can't switch positions or anything. It's like you just have to go down this exact same path, shoot the guys that come out and the exact same spots again,"
5780.0,5783.0," Area 51, the old game in the bar that Ryan Freak wins."
5783.0,5786.0, And that's where that end of.
5786.0,5794.0," And then you're looking at it, you know, there's a flight section, and you have to fly, you kill X number enemies, and the visible wall kind of vanishes,"
5794.0,5798.0," you get to move forward, and you're looking at it, and you're like, the plain sucks, bone, a land, what if I land it?"
5798.0,5805.0," I mean, everything still looks great down there. What if I just take a truck instead, a final battle on an aircraft carrier instead of standing there?"
5805.0,5809.0," Now, here's this spoiler thing, where the end of the game."
5809.0,5811.0," Ah, are you talking the end of the game?"
5811.0,5814.0," Yeah, I think I should do it. Oh, man."
5814.0,5815.0," Okay, maybe not."
5815.0,5820.0," I'm going to have to do it. But the thing is, you're not going to want me to ever talk about it again, so it's like, I don't know."
5820.0,5821.0, What do I mean?
5821.0,5827.0," Sure you will talk about it again. Okay. We'll be talking about prices for weeks, because there's so much that goes wrong there at the end, in my opinion."
5827.0,5836.0," And so it's just, it's not just that it violates the expectations, but you can everything that's happening, you could still see, well, what if they did it along the way that, so you,"
5836.0,5841.0," if they, if they maintain the approach that they had established, it would still work."
5841.0,5844.0," So you guys did, they broke the expectations that they said."
5844.0,5849.0," They still could have told the story. They could have, like, basically ramped up the game and made it better and better and better."
5849.0,5863.0," And so the point where it ended, it would have been like, oh my God, when you put it down, I cannot wait for these guys to make another game. This is freaking brilliant. So instead, I feel those, I have that emotion at many points in the beginning of the game and the midpoint of the game."
5863.0,5870.0," And at the end when it's done, because, you know, and I now, I'm kind of shackle, I can't say specifically what thanks to you."
5870.0,5874.0," What it ends, I'm like, good God."
5875.0,5884.0," Yeah, that's like, what, from what highs to what lows, you know, and it's, it's the ending of anything is really important. You can't entirely dismiss it."
5884.0,5894.0," So one, one, you know, another, similarly, and I'm so fond of using these would be, you know, you look at this perfect, you know, just mind boggling Olympic performance."
5894.0,5901.0," It's gymnast or something blows you away. Then at the end, like the motherfucker face plants on the dismount."
5901.0,5909.0," And it's like, it doesn't matter how the other stuff is still good and everyone's going to talk about your performance, but they're also going to talk about the fact that you hate shit on the dismount."
5909.0,5917.0," You know, and you always look at it as this big thing, you know, you can just break it up and say, do that was good until you broke your face."
5917.0,5920.0," I mean, it was good and you broke your face."
5920.0,5931.0," But I mean, so I'm not supposed to talk about that, you know, and again, some people clearly aren't going to react so strongly to this part of the game."
5931.0,5943.0," So is that one of the two things that brought it down to one of the two things. Yeah, that's the other thing with the, we were kidding, we're kidding, got a joke."
5944.0,5955.0," I really think though a lot of it was scaled back. I mean, I'd also, I did not write in the way that like I'm going to review this game based on what I expected to be right, but I just was also in a position."
5955.0,5960.0," I mean, I had to think about that and make sure I wasn't doing that because I also know a lot of things were caught from the game."
5960.0,5972.0," There were, you know, all these plants for frozen oceans and aliens that are shooting the ice out from beneath you so that you fall in or you're using cover, they're freezing it and shattering it, leaving you exposed."
5972.0,5979.0," Things are in the game, they just didn't make it in, you know, these big giant hundreds grabbing tanks and throwing them when you're in them all this kind of stuff like that."
5979.0,5995.0," They didn't do it. And I could be any number of reasons for it, but I think that if those things were there, if it was a matter of time, if it was a matter of assuming that more people had hardware that would meet the minimum system requirements to enable that sort of stuff."
5995.0,5998.0," I mean, whatever it would be, I do think that it would have been cool to see that."
5998.0,6002.0," Well, let me have something to just sort of put you on the spot for just one minute."
6002.0,6012.0," Yeah. Let's like, you have been pretty close to this game and you know, you've previewed it before you've, you know, you've talked to Shavad."
6012.0,6016.0," There's a lot here that you've been, you've been up on this game."
6016.0,6027.0," Yeah, and so, what do you think that someone who came to this game like completely fresh might have reacted differently to,"
6027.0,6035.0," you know, maybe maybe the ending at that point to them would have been overwhelmed by all the stuff that came before it enough to make them go like,"
6035.0,6044.0," Oh my god, it's an 11. You know what I mean? Right. Like, it is a possible that that your expectations were so high that it became a disappointment."
6044.0,6052.0," It's hard to, well, I really don't believe that it's because my expectations were so high, but I mean, expectations are established in the course of playing the game."
6052.0,6059.0," So, again, like, not every, I mean, some people just will not care. Some people are extremely happy with just about anything."
6059.0,6066.0," I mean, you can't share, you'll see people arguing to death that like just pick any random game. You know, is the best thing ever."
6066.0,6069.0," You know, and it was entirely without fault."
6069.0,6078.0," But I think if people are critical, you know, to some extent, I believe that this is going to be a thing that's repeated. I think you're going to see a lot of people talking about how."
6079.0,6086.0," Yeah, this is, I think even said in the review, I do believe that all conversations about the game will come to the point where they said, well, yeah, well, what about the end, how did you feel about it?"
6086.0,6095.0," And then maybe there will be room for disagreement there, but a lot of people just maybe more so than then, you know, the go the other direction will say that yeah, it was disappointing."
6095.0,6104.0," And that's just based on if you knew nothing about the game, if you plugged it right, you're like, this is crazy. This is totally ramping up to something. And then it's kind of like, it just really comes out of nowhere."
6104.0,6112.0, So much so that it really felt as though it were the work of two different design teams or one team that was like really good with doing.
6112.0,6121.0, This systemic open stuff and then really not so good at doing doing the other thing doing the scripted work.
6121.0,6128.0," And I don't know, I think that over time, I think people are so reactionary right now."
6128.0,6139.0," And it's just the usual, I mean, just for whatever inexplicable reason people think that there, they've been told all year that this is going to be the greatest thing ever."
6139.0,6146.0," Yeah, and then somehow you get to this like fucked up mentality, this absolutely just like clinically insane mentality where you're like, why so low."
6146.0,6151.0," Yeah, that's correct. That's that's correct game that you have played or you just started playing."
6151.0,6154.0," Yeah, these people who are reacting are they haven't finished it."
6154.0,6161.0, There was more you started it or even started in many cases. Right. But the assumption that the thing was was destined to get a 9 or 10.
6161.0,6172.0," There was a really commented in this same kind of commentary of it. Well, we've been told by previews even as as recent as a month ago that this game was going to."
6173.0,6178.0," Shatter expectations or whatever, now you're telling me otherwise we'll wrong with you and he was saying it in all serious."
6178.0,6187.0," Yeah, and there's other very just as equally serious post it said, well website X gave it 9.5 website, you know, why gave it a 9."
6187.0,6193.0, Why what's so why is your so wrong? Why isn't yours the same. That's just a very angry system.
6193.0,6199.0, And then system wars mentality. Why are you reading multiple pages then when you want them all to say the same.
6199.0,6203.0, All they wanted is their opinion to be validated. This is why you got to stop reading the internet.
6203.0,6220.0," I do that because it is mainly kids because not so I mean who well kids and but you know, I'm not saying it's going to happen in this case, but we do often hear from publishers or developers, whoever and again, I'm not saying it's a case in this case yet anyway that that we will get the call."
6220.0,6228.0," So it's like at website blog, even a 9 and this and this magazine gave it a 9. How come you did the your way lower than the Metacritic score."
6228.0,6231.0," Yeah, well that's because we're actually a different publication."
6231.0,6245.0," Right. Guess what? But another point about the game, the thing with multiplayer, I didn't include a discussion of multiplayer with the review part of this is kind of a joint thing. It's like I wrote the review for our magazine right and then one of takes it puts it online."
6245.0,6251.0, I know this is also referred to a caption where I talk about the nano suit powers and stuff like that and that didn't appear there.
6251.0,6254.0, But here's the deal.
6254.0,6259.0, The beta has been publicly available for a while and that had one level on it.
6259.0,6265.0," And aside from that, yay, I mean they did everything they could. They said like here we're going to have multiplayer sessions."
6265.0,6270.0, At first we were going to have one then it was like two and then they arranged for a third one.
6271.0,6277.0, And these were you know an hour and a half to two hour sessions on three different days. And the problem for me is that
6278.0,6286.0, I just knew that every time the multiplayer was going to be discussed in a review is just going to be descriptive. And now I feel vindicated because I went and looked and I found nothing but descriptive.
6286.0,6293.0," Sure. You know, here's what power struggle is and I'm like, well, that's what what I did in the feature I did where we talked about power struggle."
6293.0,6298.0, And I want to actually evaluating yet what is hand because they can't and they don't like I mean you have to play.
6298.0,6313.0, You take some more than a few sessions with this. And so while I have all these hunches and things that I was reacting to when I was playing in these sessions and for an one example would be that a few maps are designed to support you know air combat with vitals and jets and stuff.
6313.0,6320.0," And in order to do that with the map, you have to make it very big because they move so quickly and the turn they turn so wide and stuff like that."
6320.0,6330.0, So in the early phases of the game and I talk about phases because unlike battlefield where vehicles are there when the map starts and everyone races form and gets in them.
6330.0,6337.0, Creating the downside that people often kill each other to get them because they really want them or they just sit there and wait instead of doing something productive.
6337.0,6345.0," Right. So crytics said, you know, design logic said, let's find some way to stop people from doing this horseshit."
6345.0,6355.0, It's counterproductive to the game and what we're going to do then is make it so you buy your own vehicle and then only you can use it until you've been in it once and then it kind of unlocks so someone else can use it.
6355.0,6362.0, You have to to buy something you have to get the prestige points in order to do it and to get the prestige points you have to play for a while.
6362.0,6365.0, So at the beginning phases of these very large maps.
6366.0,6383.0, I found that you're getting into vehicle like there are freebie jeeps that are there they have no guns on them or anything and you're driving and driving and driving to one of the the many distant capture points and you know they go by different names there you know weapons factories and energy sources prototype energy sources.
6384.0,6393.0," It's just kind of like, okay, I'm driving and you get there maybe getting one firefight kill one guy, but he had someone with them and by the time you killed the first one the second guy killed you spawn again do it."
6393.0,6403.0," You're kind of getting a little bit of stuff, but then you're like, all right, this time I'm going to get this rifle and a grenade so that when I run into two guys I'm like more likely to win, you know."
6403.0,6413.0, And then it happens it could happen it could work and so if it goes one way then you'll get a little more experience and you're continuing to do this and it kind of it's I didn't find it very fulfilling you know.
6413.0,6418.0, And then if it went bad it was really bad because it was like then you only had enough to buy a pistol.
6418.0,6425.0, So you're driving the same route again you can mix it up but you're just driving another distance and then the worst case scenario no one's there.
6425.0,6435.0, Because people are just all over you meet someone is very sleepy pacing and then finally when it does ramp up and the game could take you know like one of the matches took like almost two hours.
6435.0,6439.0, Then at the end you've got jets and stuff and you're able to get around or if you have enough money.
6439.0,6454.0," So I found that annoying but it's like I don't want to just jump on that yet because I could play it for another week and say, oh you know it's missing something there's some other factors where we really do end up sort of congregating in one area and action does stay intense through all these phases."
6454.0,6464.0, And you know now that I've been playing it for a long enough time I do appreciate the solution and I think it actually is maybe superior to the battlefield scenario or whatever.
6464.0,6479.0, But you know and I don't see anyone talking about anything like this like I just see the and I can't complain what they're talking about when I'm going to talk about anything in mind but as I just wanted to wait until I could tell I felt I can give you an evaluation of this and not just a description.
6479.0,6484.0, And then this when you just have a description there and then you have your score then you have the 10 that these guys want so bad.
6484.0,6489.0, Then you're like oh that's a description of a 10 the 10 multiplayer game right there.
6489.0,6494.0, Well you know Sean we may not get the the crisis to exclusive scoop now thanks to you.
6494.0,6496.0, Yeah let's hope let's hope.
6496.0,6508.0, I think Chavad and them are our good people I mean hopefully nothing happens like that but we know that there are circumstances in this business where you say a negative thing about something to turn out on a message board.
6508.0,6520.0, I don't want negative thing in a sea of positive things and you are out they fucking hate you yep you get angry call from the from the CEO of the company to somebody over here and if Davis and then next thing you know everybody.
6520.0,6523.0, You know it's so not worth that I could see for so many people it's like.
6523.0,6529.0, Just give these games the 9's and 10's make everyone happy make the publishers happy make the kids online.
6529.0,6533.0, Why don't we do that why do we have to hate Sean it would be so much easier to do that.
6533.0,6535.0, I don't mind my new mandate.
6535.0,6541.0, 10's 9's and 10's for everything well actually if there's smaller publishers that don't advertise with us that's okay.
6541.0,6546.0, If they're big ones that want to give us money 9's and 10's so five's for everyone else.
6546.0,6549.0, Five's is a nine to 10's go right.
6549.0,6550.0, I'm good with that.
6550.0,6558.0, Five's for everything unless they advertise with us and then depending on like if it's like a half page ad they get a six it's not even that it's just straight that's.
6558.0,6563.0, It just a nine or 10 just 9's and 10 because the night why piss anywhere.
6563.0,6573.0, I'm too every time you're right these guys love games and if we give them our game to review they're going to love it and we may sell more.
6573.0,6583.0, Right why didn't I think it's before 9's and 10's next issue everything look for it again so because I mean to be serious you do you're like I'm going to be fair to myself.
6583.0,6592.0, And I'm just I mean this is I'm going to be honest you know like I said both CUD and Chris are awesome mask games I love them they're both great.
6592.0,6594.0, Yep yep but I mean.
6594.0,6601.0, They got some issues with them and and their significance to me I mean they're not neither is the best game I've ever played my life.
6601.0,6609.0, Ryan and I were in line for lunch wondering like do other entertainment industries that you know review things have this problem.
6609.0,6610.0, I bet they do.
6610.0,6618.0, Yeah I know the music industry does from people I've talked to that work that with working with with records with record reviews and stuff.
6618.0,6620.0, Yeah I'm the same sort of thing.
6620.0,6625.0, I come to Brittany only got two out of ten right kind of thing so that means you can't you can't interview.
6625.0,6631.0, And it came a week ago before do you think is to be a publicist calls up Roger Ebert and goes like.
6631.0,6636.0, Why do you only give this movie two stars he gives thumbs or what does he get started on his web.
6636.0,6638.0, Oh you're right he starts yeah.
6638.0,6643.0, So yeah well they probably do right and that's why they all love Harry Nulls.
6643.0,6646.0, Yeah okay there's that there's that's a good point.
6646.0,6647.0, That's another 10.
6647.0,6650.0, Hey you got Harry here's your free ball of chili.
6650.0,6651.0, Oh.
6651.0,6653.0, Oh.
6653.0,6654.0, Oh.
6654.0,6655.0, Oh.
6655.0,6656.0, Oh.
6656.0,6657.0, Oh.
6657.0,6660.0, I prefer Bush's baked.
6660.0,6662.0, Oh.
6662.0,6664.0, Anything you say Mr. Null.
6664.0,6667.0, Thank you for loving King Kong.
6667.0,6668.0, Yeah.
6669.0,6670.0, Yeah.
6670.0,6678.0, So I'm going to keep playing now that's out and there are other people to play in the natural environment and that aren't all EA testers who've been playing the game.
6678.0,6684.0, Very few actions for the past six months and just rip you up and see what I think about it you know.
6684.0,6689.0, Hopefully I'll have something worthwhile to say so if you like one more thing than we can give it a nine.
6689.0,6690.0, We definitely.
6690.0,6692.0, Yeah you got to go back up a point.
6692.0,6697.0, That was part of the thing that that was kind of a controversy was that the review someone put on there in the bottom.
6697.0,6699.0, I'm I'm passing the buck again.
6699.0,6703.0, But like that that will not change the score.
6703.0,6713.0, And it's like that's kind of hard because it's like I mean we do have to put out the score and it's like my sense this is my gut like from all the time I played this is the score the game gets with it right but I mean.
6713.0,6720.0, Maybe you'll have to break precedent if like I play this thing for 40 hours straight and then Ryan's looking at me like dude why are you saying this.
6720.0,6723.0, I'm just saying hypothetically you know I mean score sock.
6723.0,6725.0, I was the one you mandated that no right.
6725.0,6731.0, I wish we could I wish we could go back to that one mini revolution we had where we took the scores off everything.
6731.0,6735.0, I just say could do interviews and I need this to do something else.
6735.0,6737.0, Oh no you're doing like three next.
6737.0,6739.0, It's just not worth it.
6739.0,6743.0, It's like yeah can we just start like assigning random pictures of scores like this is a carrot.
6743.0,6745.0, Hey you know when that's a great idea.
6745.0,6747.0, I think I have a secara does that good.
6747.0,6753.0, I want to do something like to talk maybe review games on podcasts with no scores you know just say everything you want.
6753.0,6759.0, Don't have to worry about hey that may that may be in the in our future but then we don't have to give it a number.
6759.0,6763.0, We just or just talk about a lot of the have a reviews podcast.
6763.0,6764.0, I really like Sean's idea.
6764.0,6768.0, A random object in the world and we never explain the system.
6768.0,6771.0, Maybe you're not the fruits and vatsets like everything.
6771.0,6775.0, You and I are now the only ones who have who have work systems that are capable of getting.
6775.0,6776.0, That game's got games.
6776.0,6777.0, Yeah true.
6777.0,6778.0, Yeah.
6778.0,6780.0, We're the only ones who can review games now.
6780.0,6781.0, Excellent.
6781.0,6783.0, You're not going to take the top off all day.
6783.0,6784.0, That's right.
6784.0,6785.0, I'll have to pass my number.
6785.0,6786.0, I'm done with reviews after this.
6786.0,6787.0, No you're not.
6787.0,6788.0, I hate it.
6788.0,6789.0, Don't let him get you down man.
6789.0,6790.0, Why so low fight the good.
6790.0,6791.0, I saw a lot.
6791.0,6792.0, Why so low.
6792.0,6793.0, Why so low Sean.
6793.0,6794.0, Yeah.
6794.0,6795.0, That's your new motto.
6795.0,6799.0, If I see that guy to find this name if you ever see me in event come introduce yourself to Sean.
6799.0,6800.0, Why so low.
6800.0,6801.0, Elliot.
6801.0,6802.0, Why so low.
6802.0,6806.0, Okay London is um you know that little dog figure in monopoly.
6806.0,6807.0, Yeah.
6807.0,6808.0, That's the bad is.
6808.0,6809.0, That's a nice score.
6809.0,6814.0, You didn't give it the race car.
6814.0,6815.0, That's fucked up.
6815.0,6818.0, All the other magazines gave it a race car.
6818.0,6821.0, And that one website gave it the banker.
6821.0,6822.0, And you suck.
6822.0,6823.0, Little dog.
6823.0,6824.0, Jeez.
6824.0,6826.0, So how is that a feature?
6826.0,6827.0, The Richard.
6827.0,6828.0, Talk about the Vitcha.
6828.0,6830.0, Please tell me about it in accent the entire time.
6830.0,6833.0, And then we'll go back to our desk.
6833.0,6837.0, You know it's based on a it's based on a series of novels by a Polish author and I was going to do the right.
6838.0,6841.0, Smart thing and bring in the name of the author but I forgot.
6841.0,6844.0, So we'll call him a kill bossa.
6844.0,6846.0," Oh, I'll kill bossa."
6846.0,6849.0, I'm a crap ski.
6849.0,6851.0, That's that works.
6851.0,6852.0, Is that perfect?
6852.0,6853.0, Is that work?
6853.0,6854.0, Okay.
6854.0,6855.0, So no one that's the best part about that.
6855.0,6856.0, Okay.
6856.0,6860.0, The the Witcher is a RPG based on the novels by a kill bossa.
6860.0,6862.0, On crap ski.
6862.0,6864.0," And uh,"
6865.0,6868.0, actually I'm enjoying it a lot.
6868.0,6869.0, Quite a lot.
6869.0,6871.0, I'm only.
6871.0,6874.0, I'm in the ending the first act of five.
6874.0,6876.0, So I belong way to go.
6876.0,6878.0, So take it all with a grain of salt.
6878.0,6882.0," As with Sean, it may turn out that the last act is crud."
6882.0,6883.0, I'm going to change my opinion.
6883.0,6887.0, But it is getting off to it to a great start here.
6887.0,6891.0," Early on, I can say if it keeps up at this pace."
6891.0,6894.0, I don't know how many other RPGs actually came out in 2007.
6894.0,6899.0, But looking like RPG the year so far so far at this stage.
6899.0,6904.0," Because to me, everything is working completely about this game."
6904.0,6908.0," The setting, the dialogue, the combat system is fantastic."
6908.0,6913.0, The game that this most resembles to me is is oblivion.
6913.0,6917.0," But I in the short run again, I have to get after this qualifier."
6917.0,6919.0, Everything I say here based on the amount of time.
6919.0,6920.0, I put into it.
6920.0,6922.0, But I'm really digging the combat a lot.
6922.0,6925.0," In a way, I can never get over a hump with an oblivion."
6925.0,6926.0, All the time I played oblivion.
6926.0,6930.0," Speaking of jumping, you had your first hump in it last night."
6930.0,6933.0," Speaking of humping, you did, didn't you?"
6933.0,6934.0, I did.
6934.0,6937.0, I had sex in the Witcher last night.
6937.0,6938.0," Yep, I had."
6938.0,6939.0," Yeah, you had the option."
6939.0,6941.0, There's a dialogue tree comes up.
6941.0,6946.0," Basically you've done all this stuff with this pretty hot, like in which."
6946.0,6947.0, Not which.
6947.0,6977.0, You have a sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of
6977.0,7007.0," because you know, he stays sort of sortner. So, they take it back where you sort of sort of sort of look out here with Dick Marina, 약간 how he's sort of kind of sort of kind of kind of kind of kind of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of one sort of sort yet sort of sort of sort of kind of sort of kind of sort sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of kind of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of kind of sort of literary sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of kind of sort of sort of pretty kind of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort thing sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort"
7007.0,7010.24, in the European version is like a naked card.
7010.24,7013.0," But here she has like the bed, the bed spread,"
7013.0,7015.36," you know covering her up, she's like holding the bed"
7015.36,7016.2, but up.
7016.2,7018.04, But then for like half a second I thought it was gonna be
7018.04,7020.16, one of those like cards you get that like if you
7020.16,7021.76, turn it at different angle.
7021.76,7024.36, Like she's naked so I was hoping it was gonna turn
7024.36,7026.32, the mirror so I'm like turning my head sideways
7026.32,7028.52," on the monitor, I'm gonna turn it with the mouse."
7028.52,7030.8," I did, yeah I turned my head sideways"
7030.8,7032.28, and then my wife walked in.
7032.28,7034.32, Did your wife watch you play?
7034.32,7035.56, Like were you looking over your shoulder
7035.56,7036.72, when you were home being in the game?
7036.72,7038.68," No, they don't show you humping."
7038.68,7040.400000000001, It's not like a sex game.
7040.400000000001,7042.4800000000005, All that happens is like there's a dialogue.
7042.4800000000005,7045.0," It's like you've done this question and you're like,"
7045.0,7046.72, I better get back on the road.
7046.72,7048.400000000001, I got more monsters to kill.
7048.400000000001,7050.76," And she's like, you sure you wouldn't wanna stay the night?"
7050.76,7053.16, And then the choice you get like one or two choice
7053.16,7055.68," and one is like you know, you bid baby."
7055.68,7058.84," The number two is like, I really gotta go kill more monsters."
7058.84,7059.92," So you know, so I'm like,"
7059.92,7061.96," now what the hell saw I said, yeah."
7061.96,7064.360000000001, And then it just goes to a cutscene.
7064.36,7066.5199999999995," And the cutscene is actually oddly,"
7066.5199999999995,7068.5199999999995," well, you see like the feet, you see,"
7068.5199999999995,7071.32, she giggles and their feet are like walking towards the bed.
7071.32,7073.5599999999995," And then in a very non-froiting way,"
7073.5599999999995,7075.44," his sword drops to the ground,"
7075.44,7077.44," which was sort of odd like, I don't know,"
7077.44,7078.799999999999, to the sword rise.
7078.799999999999,7079.639999999999, Is that what?
7079.639999999999,7081.28, And you add the sword drops to the ground.
7081.28,7082.639999999999," Take a foot, that's my little thing."
7082.639999999999,7083.48, You don't hear anything.
7083.48,7088.48, You hear nothing and then the screen sort of goes dark
7088.48,7090.799999999999, and then it comes up and you've got your little card there.
7090.799999999999,7093.4, And then actually I was happy to find out
7093.4,7095.759999999999, that I apparently did very well.
7095.759999999999,7097.799999999999, I did a one-year-old performance.
7097.799999999999,7099.96," No, you don't get it like a number."
7099.96,7101.759999999999, You got an eight out of ten.
7101.759999999999,7103.28, You did two things wrong.
7103.28,7106.639999999999, You might want to qualify for some of our lists
7106.639999999999,7109.96, that actual sex is probably a little different than this.
7109.96,7111.679999999999," Yeah, actual sex might be different."
7111.679999999999,7112.839999999999," If you haven't had it,"
7112.839999999999,7114.24, unless you're like at the Mustang.
7114.24,7117.12," Right, for one thing, she didn't say is that it"
7117.12,7119.08, or what about me.
7119.08,7121.16, So that was different than real sex.
7121.16,7123.2, It's more like we should as far as I'm five experienced.
7123.2,7125.32," It's like God of War, the Red, the women in God of War"
7125.32,7126.32, is more like that.
7126.32,7127.639999999999, It is when I get it.
7127.639999999999,7129.32," Yeah, health comes out of him and everything."
7129.32,7133.04," No, this is actually you're not only do you kill monsters"
7133.04,7134.76, but apparently you're great and bad.
7134.76,7136.48, So this game kind of has it all.
7136.48,7137.8, That's cool.
7137.8,7138.36, Why is the Witcher?
7138.36,7139.2, It sounds good.
7139.2,7140.84," Yeah, I don't want to harp on that part."
7140.84,7142.44, Cause this is pretty easy.
7142.44,7144.84," Cause it's a very, it's a very silly part of the game."
7144.84,7147.48, It ought to probably not be in there just so that
7147.48,7151.48, smart asses like us don't waste time on the podcast talk about it.
7151.48,7154.719999999999," Because seriously, it was like 30 seconds in the game of which"
7154.719999999999,7157.839999999999, I played hours of and I enjoyed it for all sort of actual
7157.839999999999,7159.839999999999, real reasons.
7159.839999999999,7161.719999999999," You know, we have serve in our side."
7161.719999999999,7162.959999999999, We have serve in our good science.
7162.959999999999,7167.799999999999," That the combat, it really does some cool things."
7167.799999999999,7170.2," I think in the aborted podcast that we didn't post,"
7170.2,7172.08," we made, we were making fun of the fact"
7172.08,7174.0, that they're bragging about the motion capture
7174.0,7176.839999999999, that they used to capture the combat movements.
7176.839999999999,7178.16, It actually pays off in this.
7178.16,7179.959999999999, It does some really neat things.
7179.96,7184.92, That's actually sort of based a little bit on timing as you play the game.
7184.92,7188.36," It's, I mean, basically you're clicking on things until they die."
7188.36,7189.64, There's not that much strategy.
7189.64,7191.0, It's not an action game.
7191.0,7192.0, But there is.
7192.0,7196.2," But there is elements of it that like if you, if you time your mouse presses"
7196.2,7199.8," right, certain moves will happen that are, that are a choreographed."
7199.8,7204.52," And it just is, it adds a level of engagement that I haven't seen in other"
7204.52,7206.96, games.
7206.96,7208.28, The story is quite deep.
7208.28,7211.4, And I think that in the atmosphere is cool too.
7211.4,7216.16, And I think that's where benefits from being based on a series of novels.
7216.16,7220.04, Like you can tell right from the start that this wasn't just like five guys
7220.04,7223.84," sitting around a conference room in Orange County going like,"
7223.84,7229.0," ah, let's say that it's the kingdom of for Xia."
7229.0,7232.04, And there's a else.
7232.04,7232.72," OK, yeah."
7232.72,7234.52, Instead of one guy doing that.
7234.6,7235.360000000001, You can tell.
7235.360000000001,7237.080000000001, What's one guy doing in Poland?
7237.080000000001,7240.88," Instead, you can tell he's got the, what's that bizarre."
7240.88,7242.200000000001, These were whoever wrote it.
7242.200000000001,7243.88, We're in a bizarre crusher.
7243.88,7246.400000000001," But if you want to make a fuck,"
7246.400000000001,7250.120000000001," Berserca, if you would like to give him stuff,"
7250.120000000001,7251.56, Berserca.
7251.56,7252.88," Yeah, it's got that."
7252.88,7255.64, I would like to add that just because it's based on novels doesn't mean it's
7255.64,7256.52," intimately, yeah."
7256.52,7257.64," No, you're brilliant."
7257.64,7258.52," No, that's true."
7258.52,7263.72," And in fact, the novel's aren't, the novels haven't been released in the US here,"
7263.72,7268.92, but they did stick an excerpt from one of the stories I think in the box with an
7268.92,7271.88, English translation and Sean Malay and I both read this one.
7271.88,7273.52, Most sad things.
7273.52,7275.4800000000005, I don't know if you're here or the web.
7275.4800000000005,7276.360000000001, It's pretty bad.
7276.360000000001,7278.4400000000005," Yeah, well, I actually thought we could bring it in for a hero."
7278.4400000000005,7280.12, We should because there's a comic.
7280.12,7283.64, There's a dark horse comic that came with our collectors edition of Helgate.
7283.64,7284.68, And I tried to read.
7284.68,7286.68, And I gave you my test before.
7286.68,7288.76," I need some name for it, but when you're in the bathroom."
7288.76,7293.240000000001, And so when you're sitting there and if you'd rather read this or like the
7294.2,7297.8," whatever the pharmaceutical information on like baby powder or something,"
7298.599999999999,7299.96, like I really stopped reading.
7299.96,7302.84," I got about three pages in and it was like,"
7302.84,7308.92, the don't became the kind that you take in an airport and a dirty airport rather than in the comfort of your own home.
7308.92,7315.32," You know, like, put your feet up and I can't make any step judgment based on, you know,"
7315.32,7318.679999999999," that's a little excerpt because obviously, you could have been hastily translated."
7318.679999999999,7323.16," Right, it's possible that this is not the actual translation that we're going to get."
7323.24,7325.24, When the book really comes out in English.
7325.24,7328.2, This is the kind of translation scheme.
7328.2,7330.92," Like it's the kind of thing where, you know, one character's like,"
7330.92,7332.76," where are we going to go now? And then the next guy's like,"
7333.719999999999,7338.5199999999995, can't you see they have reftated a cleft in the weft and wane?
7340.36,7341.48, You're talking about the hell.
7341.48,7343.32," Yeah, well, and the witch."
7343.32,7347.5599999999995," No, they've torn a cleft in the weft and weve reality."
7347.5599999999995,7349.719999999999," And like, I mean, it's like that kind of shit."
7349.72,7354.52, And then you look at the next page is a double getting like some like part of his limbs chopped off.
7354.52,7357.72, And then like the next page is kind of the same thing and people just like
7357.96,7359.72, posing and like grunting and stuff.
7359.72,7364.280000000001," And then it's back to the other guy talking about that that same like penthouse, like Shakespeare"
7364.280000000001,7366.6," and era penthouse, pent forum letters."
7366.6,7368.4400000000005, Wow. So this is dark horse comics.
7368.4400000000005,7369.8," Yeah, because they're dark horse."
7369.8,7371.0, They put some good stuff out.
7371.0,7373.0, They put some good stuff out.
7373.0,7374.6," Oh, yeah, because they definitely didn't."
7374.6,7375.0, For sure.
7375.0,7377.0, This is something that I think it's bad.
7377.0,7378.6, It's on speakably bad.
7378.68,7379.56," Okay, so we'll do it here."
7379.56,7380.04, Those are the web.
7380.04,7381.0, That's seen in the movie.
7381.0,7384.360000000001," And many, maybe we can save that scene for the hero of the web then."
7384.360000000001,7385.04, Of what?
7385.04,7386.04, The witcher.
7386.04,7387.04," Oh, for the witcher."
7387.04,7389.240000000001, Describe one of the events in the novel thing.
7389.240000000001,7390.52," So, okay."
7390.52,7391.240000000001, I'll save it.
7391.240000000001,7392.04, Save it.
7392.04,7394.04," So, yeah."
7394.04,7396.04, So the combat is great.
7396.04,7396.68, There's.
7399.320000000001,7399.72, Fuck it.
7399.72,7400.52, Tell us what?
7400.52,7400.92, What's?
7400.92,7402.92," Well, you want to hear this story?"
7402.92,7403.72, Come to the chase.
7403.72,7404.04, Alright.
7404.04,7405.240000000001," Go back to the story, Sean."
7405.240000000001,7406.04, You want to see what you want?
7406.04,7406.76, You want to see what you want?
7406.76,7407.76, Yeah.
7407.76,7410.88," I mean, where he got the witcher, which is named Gerald."
7410.88,7411.88, Gerald?
7411.88,7412.88, Yeah.
7412.88,7413.88, He got the witcher.
7413.88,7415.68," He goes to visit this wizard, whatever."
7415.68,7419.0, The wizard just made an illusionary paradise.
7419.0,7420.72, And there's some girl totally naked girl.
7420.72,7421.72, Like Karen Semapples.
7421.72,7425.12," And like, of course, he's like, would you like to make it with my illusion?"
7425.12,7428.0," It's like, oh, well, she's an illusion."
7428.0,7429.0, Can you feel her too?
7429.0,7430.8," And he's like, oh, yes."
7430.8,7432.6, And then he turns it down.
7432.6,7435.64," But it's just, it's one of those scenes where you can read it."
7435.72,7438.84," And it was like, uh, that's absurd about it."
7438.84,7443.8, I observed an awkward moment when that salvatore dude meets the penthouse letters.
7443.8,7444.8, Yeah.
7444.8,7447.96, That's when you get some of the finest fantasy.
7447.96,7451.08," But, but I am really enjoying the game."
7451.08,7452.08, I am.
7452.08,7458.8," I do think this is, I can turn out to be one of the great RPGs of the year and maybe"
7458.8,7459.8, of the last few.
7459.8,7462.280000000001," Well, you really dug a, that's what it's never learned."
7462.280000000001,7463.280000000001, It's never learned.
7463.280000000001,7464.280000000001, It's never learned.
7464.28,7467.5199999999995, It's really dig never winter nights to expansion quite a bit.
7467.5199999999995,7468.84, This was a very different game.
7468.84,7471.759999999999," I mean, that's a D&D game."
7471.759999999999,7473.04, This is a whole different thing.
7473.04,7476.16, What inanimate object would you give it?
7476.16,7480.599999999999, I would give it the Witcher a rabbit squirrel.
7480.599999999999,7481.599999999999, That's not it.
7481.599999999999,7483.679999999999," Oh, that's, no, you said inanimate."
7483.679999999999,7484.679999999999," Now, fuck."
7484.679999999999,7485.679999999999, I believe it.
7485.679999999999,7486.84, I'll give it a cash call.
7486.84,7488.639999999999, Sadden on a cash call.
7488.639999999999,7490.24," No, I would not."
7490.24,7491.4, I don't know what object I give it.
7491.4,7495.599999999999," Also, I just, I do want to say though that if you, if you do start the Witcher, there's,"
7495.599999999999,7500.759999999999," there's a, there's a prologue and the prologue, which basically teaches you everything"
7500.759999999999,7501.759999999999, there's to learn in the game.
7501.759999999999,7505.48, And there's a lot of different stuff you have to learn.
7505.48,7507.24, Goes on for a long time.
7507.24,7508.24, And it's fairly linear.
7508.24,7512.759999999999, And there are a shitload of cutscenes and a lot of exposition.
7512.759999999999,7515.32," And it gets a little weary, wearying."
7515.32,7519.44," But if you hang in there and get past that, when you get to the formal start of Act"
7519.44,7523.48," 1, then you're kind of in a more oblivion like environment where you can go do what you"
7523.48,7524.48, want.
7524.48,7527.36, And there's quests open up to you that you don't have to tackle in a quarter.
7527.36,7528.639999999999," It's like sort of an environment, too."
7528.639999999999,7530.799999999999," It's just this big natural, it's a big world."
7530.799999999999,7537.16," But there is more of a, there's a little more direction, which I appreciate."
7537.16,7539.36, But oblivion was almost too open to me.
7539.36,7542.599999999999," But you know, and there is a main quest, but there are also right in the very first"
7542.599999999999,7543.599999999999, town.
7543.599999999999,7547.36," There's like, you know, like in wild, there's like a, a bolt and board with quests that you"
7547.36,7549.08, can take if you want to.
7549.08,7551.4, And those will take you in different directions.
7551.4,7554.24, But I do find it a little more guided than oblivion.
7554.24,7557.24, OK.
7557.24,7559.5599999999995," That's, I guess."
7559.5599999999995,7561.8, It uses one more thing.
7561.8,7565.88, It uses the Bywords Aurora engine.
7565.88,7568.12," And the only problem with that, it actually looks great."
7568.12,7573.2, But the problem is the fricking load times are a pain in the ass in the scheme.
7573.2,7575.12, So it's another downside.
7575.12,7580.04," Like you'll be at, you'll be in one of the towns and there's a little shack there to"
7580.04,7582.04," go into and you're like, yeah, I wonder if I go in there."
7582.04,7585.64," So I'm going to be a question, maybe just some item I want to take or whatever."
7585.64,7589.44," And you hesitate on even going in the shack because you're like, worried about the load"
7589.44,7590.44, time.
7590.44,7592.16, So that sucks.
7592.16,7594.36, That's one of my points I'm taking off the score.
7594.36,7595.76, That's the point right there.
7595.76,7598.76," You know, that reminds me."
7598.76,7601.48," We out, we out, we out, we out, we out, we out, we out."
7601.48,7602.48, We back.
