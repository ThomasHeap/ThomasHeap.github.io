143.1,153.1, Hello and welcome to GFW radio podcast. This is our podcast for 2019 2007.
153.1,157.1, We hope this one records or we're never going to do this again.
157.1,167.1," And goodbye. And now I'm here with Jeff Green, the energy of GFW radio or no magazine."
167.1,178.1," Also radio. You released the NCCGW. I'm a multimedia mogul. You have to be radio and magazine and I'm here with the staff, which are as well as Ryan Scott, Darren Gladstone."
178.1,186.1, I'm shining on and on and on and on and on. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm shining on and on and on.
186.1,188.1, Me too.
188.1,193.1," I'm shining on and on. So yeah, so last week kind of a kind of a big fiasco."
193.1,196.1," Well, that was probably our best podcast ever and now."
196.1,204.1, It's definitely the best one ever. Two hours gone for good in dubitably destroyed every time something goes wrong this week.
204.1,210.1, Let's just keep reminding people they should have really heard last week or just make up stuff that was in that missing two hours.
210.1,221.1," Right. Oh, we talked about that last week. Yeah. Yeah. That was like in the future. We could basically just some some week when we whatever the stars align in such a way that prevent us from taping."
221.1,224.1, We can just pretend that we lost it again and list every.
224.1,225.1, Oh yeah. Yeah.
225.1,229.1," Yeah. That's well, does he use that from possibly of dubit? It's a pretty great excuse."
229.1,235.1," Seriously, Sean, how are we going to make sure that this doesn't happen again this week? I really don't know."
235.1,242.1," But it was well, that's reassuring. It was cool. It's like in like there are ways. I know I know exactly what what wrong. So I won't do that again. Basically."
242.1,247.1," You know, we should really have Ryan taking down like like transcription as we talk here."
247.1,248.1, What?
248.1,250.1, What does he shoot?
250.1,258.1," Is that the fact the one week that we didn't put the podcast up, we got like a bigger threads and message words than we ever had."
258.1,259.1, Yeah.
259.1,261.1, I think that's how awesome is that cool.
261.1,268.1," But no, I mean, they could be one of the scenarios where people a lot of people were out there that like, you know, all the people that posted on our blog entry."
268.1,275.1," That I had no idea that they were even one of, you know, the common members are that they listen until, you know, we take away what they're used to and then they had something to say."
275.1,276.1, That was good.
276.1,277.1, Yeah.
277.1,281.1," Of course, then we got guys who registered just to tell us we suck and then never post again."
281.1,282.1, Thanks for joining one up.
282.1,285.1, And then you've been editing a register again and again and again.
285.1,288.1, Welcome back to suck.
289.1,294.1, So I don't know if we're going to cover anything we covered last week if we're just going to let that vanish.
294.1,296.1, Can't recapture them as we can.
296.1,298.1, Can't recapture this gone gone forever.
298.1,301.1," There's one thing I think we should talk about though, probably stills the same cities."
301.1,302.1," Oh, yeah."
302.1,303.1, So societies.
303.1,304.1, We could do all that.
304.1,308.1, It's just it's just all the specific tangents like the in the Walgreens and right.
308.1,309.1," Oh, now we can't go."
309.1,310.1," Yeah, we can't do that."
310.1,311.1, Can't recapture that.
311.1,314.1, But let me tell you that was funny stuff and you all missed it.
314.1,316.1, I just want those Walgreens jokes.
316.1,317.1, Great.
317.1,320.1, You were awesome when we did that chief.
320.1,321.1, Because it was a small podcast.
321.1,323.1, But we're just going to be doing that.
323.1,326.1," Remember when you said, yeah, oh, Darren, yeah, you weren't here."
326.1,327.1, Where are you?
327.1,330.1," Yeah, it's right. I'm not allowed to say where I was, but in a couple weeks."
330.1,331.1, Why can't you say it? We said it.
331.1,333.1," Oh, but that podcast is gone."
333.1,334.1, So we said it.
334.1,335.1, So we said it.
335.1,336.1, Certain dip at us.
336.1,337.1," Wait, really, you can't say."
337.1,338.1, You can't think when knows about it.
338.1,339.1, Yeah.
339.1,342.1," No, actually, well, the fact that I was there,"
342.1,346.1, it's really where they asked that I'd not say anything about my even being there until.
346.1,347.1, That's ridiculous.
347.1,348.1, I know.
348.1,349.1, I know.
349.1,350.1, I know.
350.1,353.1," All right. Well, it's a big time RPG from a big time company."
353.1,354.1, Exactly.
354.1,357.1, Located opposite the coast from California.
357.1,358.1, So you figured out.
358.1,360.1," It's technically, I didn't say it."
360.1,362.1, Let's narrow down a further show.
362.1,365.1, What the hell? Who cares?
365.1,366.1, All right. Let's move on.
366.1,368.1, So you got some topics to tell us about it?
368.1,369.1," Yeah, we got some topics."
369.1,371.1," Well, like I said, we got the same,"
371.1,372.1, Sim City thing we're going to do.
372.1,375.1, Because we announced the new Sim City game.
375.1,376.1, We announced it.
376.1,378.1, We saw before everybody.
378.1,379.1," Scoup, scoup, scoup."
379.1,384.1," Uh, and uh, the announcement caused a bit of a wreck us online."
384.1,387.1," A Hullabaloo, as it were."
387.1,389.1, A Bruha.
389.1,394.1, That was a little all three.
394.1,397.1," What the, oh, you missed the best one."
397.1,398.1, You're seeing trekkies.
398.1,399.1, But the buckle.
399.1,404.1," It's a little, it's been a couple of weeks."
404.1,407.1," So all the, in initial internet winers."
407.1,408.1," Well, there's still a lot of people lining."
408.1,411.1, A lot of people upset about the direction this game is going in.
411.1,416.1," Um, but it's not quite at the same level of frothyness as it was on the day."
416.1,418.1, We posted the one screenshot.
418.1,421.1," So, uh, we're going to talk about that."
421.1,422.1," Uh, we're going to talk about, uh,"
422.1,428.1," Uh, oh, we have, uh, do we have a winner to announce of the command and conquer three book?"
428.1,429.1, Yeah.
429.1,431.1," Uh, novel writing contest."
431.1,432.1, We've entered it down to three final.
433.1,438.1," I think we, I think we can say, safely say we can give each of them a book or at least two of the three book."
438.1,439.1, Yeah.
439.1,440.1, Yeah.
440.1,441.1, They win.
441.1,442.1," They were, congratulations on that."
442.1,443.1, I'm a little bit of a quarter on that.
443.1,444.1, Yeah.
444.1,445.1, Yeah.
445.1,447.1, It was that of the recycle bin for those two books.
447.1,449.1," The, uh, the bozo bin for sure."
449.1,450.1, All right.
450.1,455.1," Uh, we've got a list of the, uh, a, a kind of, uh, dubious list of the top ten MMOs."
455.1,457.1," We're going to read that often and, uh,"
457.1,459.1, comment on that.
459.1,461.1," Uh, we got a here's of the web coming up later on."
461.1,462.1, Right.
462.1,463.1, Yeah.
463.1,464.1, We got a couple of kinds of random stuff like that.
464.1,467.1," And then, uh, an oddzen ends of news bits."
467.1,470.1, Or I could just keep talking about what we're going to talk about for the next hour.
470.1,472.1," And then, uh, then I could say we have no more time."
472.1,475.1," Or we, or we, or we, or we lost that podcast."
475.1,476.1, Yeah.
476.1,478.1, Let's start over.
480.1,482.1," Oh, ready."
482.1,483.1, This is bad.
483.1,484.1, This is bad.
484.1,485.1," You get us the credits, man."
485.1,487.1, We need a laugh track this week.
488.1,489.1, Okay.
489.1,492.1, So it's not about as sim city societies.
492.1,493.1, Ryan.
493.1,495.1, So how about sim city societies?
495.1,496.1, Here we go.
496.1,497.1, How's the fire?
497.1,499.1, There are a with you with a bicycle chain.
499.1,501.1, Unless you start talking more.
501.1,502.1, Damn.
502.1,503.1, Wow.
503.1,507.1," So our, our, our august cover which July."
507.1,508.1," Oh, okay."
508.1,512.1," Our July cover is sim city societies, which is the fifth, uh,"
512.1,516.1," sim city game, the first since 2003 is or is sim city floor."
516.1,521.1," Well, it's the fifth game to bear the sim city title."
521.1,528.1," And, uh, EA, uh, who is who publishes sim city has decided that, uh,"
528.1,532.1, the series has gotten too freaking hardcore to keep going down.
532.1,534.1," It, it's current path."
534.1,539.1," And they, they've come up with what, what, they, they, they,"
539.1,543.1, They're saying it might not be part of the main series.
543.1,544.1, They're not calling this game sim city.
544.1,546.1, That's one way to hedge your bets.
546.1,549.1," So like the moment ago, you declared that they decided to go to hardcore,"
549.1,552.1," but I'm sure somewhere in PR lands, someone's like,"
552.1,555.1," No, no, no, no, no, no, they got it wrong."
555.1,557.1," It's not that we decided it's too hardcore,"
557.1,559.1, but we decided we wanted to offer.
559.1,562.1, We haven't announced that there's a sim city six or whatever the number is five.
562.1,563.1, And we might still do that.
563.1,567.1, But this is for the people that don't want to work with the sewage pipes.
567.1,568.1," Yeah, pretty much said that."
568.1,571.1," That's what they, yeah, that's what we want to see the game."
571.1,572.1, Yeah.
572.1,574.1, And it's like a wait and see how well it does.
574.1,577.1," Right. I mean, they basically said pretty much consciously."
577.1,579.1," Like, well, there may still be a sim city five."
579.1,581.1, This may end up just being a skew of sim city.
581.1,582.1," So they kind of, exactly."
582.1,585.1, So they're kind of positioning this like what was the streets of sim city
585.1,588.1," and sim, well, I don't think they're doing either yet."
588.1,590.1," I think they're willing, they're right."
590.1,591.1, Is that fair to say?
591.1,594.1," I mean, I like to put end up being sim city five."
594.1,596.1," I think if it, if it completely takes,"
596.1,598.1," they'll be like, yeah, I didn't really count."
598.1,599.1, Uh-huh.
599.1,601.1," But if it, if it, if it, if it, if it, if it, if it, if it, if it,"
602.1,606.1," does really well, you know, maybe they'll kind of embrace that for the first time."
606.1,608.1," You know, we're just dealing with our Maggie."
608.1,609.1, Only kidding.
609.1,612.1," Oh, by, you know, we should be able to do that with GFW."
612.1,616.1," Like instead of like the July, is you GFW calling whatever."
616.1,620.1," So like if it tanks and we go, that wasn't really the July issue."
620.1,622.1, The real July issue is coming.
622.1,623.1, Yeah.
623.1,624.1, Yeah.
624.1,625.1, We need to subtitle.
625.1,626.1, I just don't like calling every month.
626.1,627.1, True.
627.1,628.1, Yeah.
628.1,629.1, And yet we still run it.
629.1,630.1, So as well.
630.1,634.1," So part of the, the big surprise with this game is that it's not being developed by my"
634.1,635.1, Maxis.
635.1,636.1, Yeah.
636.1,639.1, Maxis is busy with the sport.
639.1,640.1, What?
640.1,641.1, Yeah.
641.1,642.1, busy with sport.
642.1,647.1," And instead it's being developed by tilted mill, which is the former impressions"
647.1,651.1, guys who did children of the Nile and Caesar for.
651.1,652.1, Uh-huh.
652.1,655.1," I mean, I remember children that I was doing pretty well with how the Caesar for it."
655.1,656.1, I don't remember.
657.1,659.1, What is far as how good it was.
659.1,663.1," I mean, are these guys like, are they leaving the Caesar franchise in a good"
663.1,664.1, pair of white good?
664.1,666.1, I've always liked the Caesar series.
666.1,667.1, It's okay.
667.1,668.1, All right.
668.1,669.1, Not my favorite.
669.1,671.1, But it's all right.
671.1,672.1, I like children of the Nile.
672.1,674.1, I didn't place his report.
674.1,676.1, I didn't play children of the Nile.
676.1,677.1, The name was well too.
677.1,678.1, I can't even.
678.1,681.1, Just keep thinking of like the children of the papyrus.
681.1,683.1," You know, I can't think of children of the coronia."
683.1,685.1, Children of the papyrus.
685.1,687.1, I can't think of the carousers.
687.1,688.1, I can't think of the carousers.
688.1,689.1, God man.
689.1,690.1, I got a five.
690.1,693.1," We're all on cultured idiot, Sean."
693.1,694.1, Yeah.
694.1,695.1, What's papyrus?
695.1,700.1," Even if it was a bad joke, dude, you could at least ignore it."
700.1,703.1," No, it reminds me of children of the coronia."
703.1,708.1," You're wrong, Sean Elliott."
708.1,712.1," So many, you're you're over two of those jokes."
712.1,713.1, Oh well.
713.1,714.1, So.
714.1,715.1, So what?
715.1,716.1, What's the new direction?
716.1,718.1, Let's get there.
718.1,724.1," So the central tenet of Sims the D societies is your society, your Sims."
724.1,732.1," And as opposed to your, as opposed to your city, I mean the city's always been kind of the focus of the season the past."
732.1,735.1, And now they're kind of.
735.1,739.1, I guess taking some of what they've learned from the Sims series and.
739.1,745.1," I mean, putting the focus a little bit more on the people of the city and how how you're your decisions affect them."
745.1,746.1, Right.
746.1,751.1, So and how does that affect like specific like gameplay elements?
751.1,762.1," Well, as opposed to just having money that you build up, you know, or whatever, there are there are six social energies that you build up during the game depending on what you do."
762.1,764.1, And those social energies are.
764.1,766.1, I don't know the magazine for me this week.
766.1,768.1, I might not be able to remember all six by.
768.1,769.1, You wrote it.
769.1,772.1, I don't know if I can solve the magazine.
772.1,774.1," Okay, so let's see what you have to do."
774.1,776.1, You fucking wrote it.
776.1,777.1, What's for good.
777.1,779.1," Hey, so they're the six."
779.1,781.1, He's so good to go.
781.1,782.1," Like, Hulk out on your."
782.1,783.1, All right.
783.1,784.1," Hey, I let's see if I can remember."
784.1,790.1," Okay, the six social energies are wealth industry knowledge, creativity, devotion and obedience."
790.1,791.1, God.
791.1,792.1, God.
792.1,793.1, That's what that's.
794.1,795.1, Industry.
795.1,796.1, I'm a big activity.
796.1,797.1, Devotion and obedience.
797.1,798.1, All right.
798.1,799.1, That's it.
799.1,802.1, So the city is a living city kind of like it's like one big sim.
802.1,805.1," I mean, I mean, that's it."
805.1,806.1, It's a sim city.
806.1,807.1, Yeah.
807.1,808.1, Yeah.
808.1,809.1," No, no."
809.1,810.1," But I mean, like, not like this."
810.1,811.1, It's not a bad analogy.
811.1,812.1, Right.
812.1,816.1, And how you how you evolve and pursue those different.
816.1,818.1, What do they call social energies?
818.1,819.1, Social energies.
819.1,822.1," Well, effect how your city looks and grows."
822.1,823.1, Right.
823.1,825.1, In the same way that you would operate with the sim.
825.1,826.1, Exactly.
826.1,827.1, Yeah.
827.1,832.1," Just like we're supposed to before taking the idea of before being in the last segment,"
832.1,838.1, taking the idea of a sim and expanding it so that the individual then becomes an entire culture.
838.1,839.1, Right.
839.1,841.1, And you look at it as this sort of group thing.
841.1,847.1, Think mode and there if they're devout or what are the other options.
847.1,848.1, Need that retry.
848.1,849.1, Yeah.
849.1,850.1, Don't play.
850.1,851.1, How should I cut the sound?
852.1,865.1," But I guess the big controversies, obviously, that, you know, this is a lot less of a hardcore sim city building simulator than all the other sim cities were."
865.1,866.1," Yeah, that's good."
866.1,867.1," Well, I'll tell you it is."
867.1,868.1," Hell yeah, I mean, it is."
868.1,869.1, Yeah.
869.1,870.1," I told him, how does right?"
870.1,872.1," To you too, Sean the lawyer."
872.1,873.1," Um, I don't know."
873.1,874.1, I have to.
874.1,875.1," You know, I like sim city for."
875.1,876.1, Yeah.
876.1,879.1," I mean, you know, maybe I did maybe I didn't like it before, you know,"
880.1,883.1," I mean, you still do you can all go back to play this is something different."
883.1,887.1," I mean, I don't necessarily, you know, I didn't necessarily love laying switch pipes by any mean."
887.1,892.1," But this is, I mean, one of the key things you're doing is not zoning anymore."
892.1,894.1, You're like popping down the building themselves.
894.1,895.1, Is that correct?
895.1,896.1, Right.
896.1,897.1, So that's like a big change.
897.1,902.1," I think in the in the great loss podcast, which was so great."
902.1,904.1, It was the last week.
904.1,907.1," We, um, we said that, you know,"
908.1,913.1," where, where could they have gone really at this point with sim city five in that same door right?"
913.1,918.1," It was kind of just like more detail, more building, you know, better textures for the windows or whatever."
918.1,923.1," You know, and then the people who are complaining on the internet, the ones who are really in to sim city four."
923.1,924.1, And so they would not write that.
924.1,926.1, There's so much potential here.
926.1,927.1," I mean, like where."
927.1,929.1," I mean, I guess."
929.1,935.1," I'm, I didn't admit this and then the mob can come after me, but I haven't played any of this in city,"
935.1,947.1," but I'm assuming that they're engaging your, you know, your efficiency and your, you know, urban planning and all these other things and however, I'm not sure what the gauge for success was, but here it seems interesting in that."
947.1,953.1," I mean, because we're able to basically create a society with any number of faces, you know,"
953.1,960.1," hyper, you know, dictatorships with, you know, or welli and backdrops and everything like that."
960.1,964.1," You can throw that in comparison, you've trusted to a hippieville where you've got money."
964.1,973.1," You've got, you've got mimes on every corner and just, you know, tied eye jumpers, which they sell in Berkeley, you know, out on, yeah, sure telegraph avenue."
973.1,974.1, I call them acid babies.
974.1,976.1," It's like, did I jumper?"
976.1,977.1," Oh, yeah."
977.1,978.1," Anyway, I see it to come on that."
978.1,980.1, That's child abuse putting that shit on your kid.
980.1,983.1," But you could do the equivalent of that in this game, right?"
983.1,984.1," Right, Ryan?"
984.1,985.1," I mean, it's pretty much how it is."
985.1,991.1," Yeah, I mean, like the previous sim cities, you know, you had like, you're only go was to,"
991.1,993.1, did as many people in your city.
993.1,994.1," Right, right."
994.1,997.1, The success was to pay basically by finance.
997.1,1002.1," Yeah, you look at population density charts and pull some charts and that's kind of how you gauge your, well, you were doing."
1002.1,1003.1, Right.
1003.1,1009.1," So this this is, you know, people are calling this a lot like, well, it was like, city life."
1009.1,1012.1, That was people have been making comparisons.
1012.1,1017.1," Like the sparingly saying, well, this is like a kid's version, but I mean, really,"
1018.1,1021.1, I feel like especially different this early on.
1021.1,1023.1," I mean, of course, people are resistant to change."
1023.1,1031.1," People can handle something different, but it's like, there's really hasn't been that much information out to be so negative about this game already."
1031.1,1034.1," It's like, let's give them a chance."
1034.1,1036.1, Let's give them a chance to fuck it up.
1036.1,1037.1, That would be angry.
1037.1,1041.1," This is, I mean, like, but I found myself wondering though, if they didn't call it sim city,"
1041.1,1043.1, and they just called it like something else.
1043.1,1044.1, Sure.
1044.1,1045.1, Would people be as pissed off?
1046.1,1049.1," Well, of course, I'm not exactly so just forget the sim city name for a second."
1049.1,1053.1," I just get, just calm the fuck down for five seconds."
1053.1,1056.1," You bitch just want to say, deja vu Darren excluded."
1056.1,1057.1, Sure.
1057.1,1063.1," It reminds me of comic books, you know, say it again, just because where you've got a different creative team,"
1063.1,1066.1, different directions occurring on books that have been around a long time.
1066.1,1072.1," And there's the same guys on the message board, maybe Jeff is able to give us an approximation of how they sound,"
1072.1,1080.1," but the first thing they hear, you know, they do when they hear that whatever team that they're used to or whoever whichever artist they they love so much as doing their book."
1080.1,1081.1," And I do this too, you know,"
1081.1,1084.1, the ultimate like Brian hitches and Mark Mularnot do an A more.
1084.1,1085.1," Well, that's it."
1085.1,1086.1, Intentionate.
1086.1,1087.1," You know, and it's the same thing."
1087.1,1088.1, It's the same thing.
1088.1,1089.1, It's the same thing.
1089.1,1091.1," But other times, you get this new team on."
1091.1,1093.1," You're like, wow, who'd have thought to have done this?"
1093.1,1096.1," This is actually better than, yeah, that could have been the last."
1096.1,1099.1," The last, the last, the last, the last, the last, the last big one when I was out."
1099.1,1100.1, Right.
1100.1,1101.1, I'm sorry.
1101.1,1102.1, But I think it's appropriate.
1102.1,1103.1, You can do that.
1103.1,1104.1, I agree.
1104.1,1108.1," And it's relevant for, I don't know, how many other, how many other media does that analogy work for?"
1108.1,1109.1, I guess different writer.
1109.1,1111.1," I mean, some people, you'd have to be a really good person."
1111.1,1114.1," But for, but for, directors on movies is great, especially."
1114.1,1115.1," I'll give you a great, especially."
1115.1,1117.1, I'll give you a great TV one.
1117.1,1118.1, Gilmore girls.
1118.1,1119.1," You had, I'm sorry."
1119.1,1122.1, I'm going to have to turn in my man car.
1122.1,1123.1, I'm not on.
1123.1,1124.1, I knew you were going to say that.
1124.1,1126.1," I don't even know what that is, but the name is Gilmore girls."
1126.1,1127.1, I'm sorry.
1127.1,1128.1, There's people who listening here.
1128.1,1129.1, We're going to back me up that show.
1129.1,1130.1, Rold.
1130.1,1131.1, Party in on the streets.
1131.1,1132.1, We got off the gates.
1132.1,1133.1, No.
1133.1,1136.1, The theme songs actually down my caral king.
1136.1,1141.1, I've seen a couple episodes and I will concede.
1141.1,1143.1, It is not what I thought based on the title.
1143.1,1144.1, Exactly.
1144.1,1145.1, It's not golden girls.
1145.1,1146.1, It's not the Arthur.
1146.1,1147.1, No.
1147.1,1148.1, But a laugh track.
1148.1,1149.1, But like isn't it?
1149.1,1152.1," For some reason, I'm thinking it's like the equivalent of like 30 something golden"
1152.1,1153.1," girls, but in not."
1153.1,1154.1, No.
1154.1,1155.1, No.
1155.1,1156.1, No.
1156.1,1157.1," All of them have got like, not counterfeit man."
1157.1,1158.1, It's not.
1158.1,1159.1, It's so witty.
1159.1,1160.1, It threatened to topple in on its own.
1160.1,1164.1, It's a mom and her daughter and the dialogue.
1164.1,1165.1, It was.
1165.1,1166.1, The show's over now.
1166.1,1168.1, It was incredibly sharp and fast.
1168.1,1169.1, It was written by this one.
1169.1,1174.1, Multi-bathes one writer Amy Sherman Paladino who actually cut her teeth on Roseanne back
1174.1,1175.1, in the day.
1175.1,1176.1, She and her husband.
1176.1,1180.1, They basically shepherd the show for years and years.
1180.1,1187.1, And it had very much had the pace of like a scubaal comedy of the 30s where everybody
1187.1,1193.1, is talking super fast and the cultural references were flying left and right and you would
1193.1,1195.1, have to listen multiple times to get it all.
1195.1,1197.1," But anyway, the point is just like Sim City."
1197.1,1198.1, Just like Sim City.
1198.1,1199.1, Yeah.
1199.1,1200.1, This is why this is our elephant.
1200.1,1201.1, The point is so pretending.
1201.1,1202.1, She did this.
1202.1,1203.1, I know you're not.
1203.1,1208.1," The point for those listening, the point is they did the show for six seasons on and it was"
1208.1,1209.1, basically their show.
1209.1,1210.1, And then it was a contract dispute.
1210.1,1212.1, An Amy Sherman Paladino left.
1212.1,1213.1," She said, screw it."
1213.1,1214.1, I created the show.
1214.1,1215.1, It's my show.
1215.1,1216.1, But I'm out.
1216.1,1217.1, I'm not doing it anymore.
1217.1,1219.1, But the show stayed on the air for one more year.
1219.1,1221.1, And so you had this whole year.
1221.1,1227.1," A fan's going like, oh my god, the show so should have died because the whole town is gone because"
1227.1,1228.1, there's a different writer now.
1228.1,1233.1, New writers came in and they tried to keep the Gilmour girls thing going to mistake that whole
1233.1,1234.1, thing.
1234.1,1239.1, But everybody like me who sadly I've seen every single episode of every season could really tell the
1239.1,1241.1, difference in the tenor of the dialogue.
1241.1,1244.1," And we were I was among the people going like, why didn't they cancel this last"
1244.1,1245.1, year?
1245.1,1247.1, We're already never talked this way.
1247.1,1251.1," How could she, she would never be her boyfriend last year?"
1251.1,1253.1, That didn't video that.
1253.1,1259.1," So, you know, that was an example of a franchise that was taken away from its original"
1259.1,1262.1, people and it got fucked up.
1262.1,1263.1, And now it's canceled.
1263.1,1264.1, And I'm happy.
1264.1,1268.1," It's like, okay, now we can pretend that that episode of Gilmour girls never existed."
1268.1,1271.1," I thought you're going to bring this back and say, but it turned out to be awesome anyway"
1271.1,1272.1, in a different way.
1272.1,1273.1," No, actually it's okay."
1273.1,1275.1," Yeah, no, so that's okay."
1275.1,1276.1, So thanks.
1276.1,1279.1," And there just, maybe it works both ways then, is what we're saying."
1279.1,1280.1, Right.
1280.1,1284.1, I have no idea honestly which category some cities societies will fall into.
1284.1,1285.1, Right.
1285.1,1287.1, But there are plenty of examples that go either way.
1287.1,1290.1," Video games and movies, Congress TV, whatever you need."
1290.1,1292.1, So let's give an example of where it worked.
1292.1,1293.1, To counter my deal.
1293.1,1294.1, Here's my deal mark.
1294.1,1295.1, Limitation Empire.
1295.1,1296.1," Go, go, give me a answer."
1296.1,1297.1, That part of Strix back.
1297.1,1298.1, Fuck you.
1298.1,1299.1, Yeah.
1299.1,1300.1, Yeah.
1300.1,1301.1, There you go.
1301.1,1302.1, Bam.
1303.1,1308.1," DC recently announced that there, there are current flashbacks."
1308.1,1309.1," Oh, no, no, no, no."
1309.1,1313.1, That is waiting for this is being canceled as of this week's issues.
1313.1,1314.1, Thank God.
1314.1,1319.1," And they are going back to the original series and the original numbering, which ended at two thirty."
1319.1,1321.1, How does it had us to flash not work?
1321.1,1323.1, All the dead dude does is run fast.
1323.1,1324.1, How do you fuck that up?
1324.1,1325.1," They, they screwed it up."
1325.1,1328.1," In the new, in the new flash, he ran slow."
1328.1,1329.1, Hey moonwalks.
1329.1,1330.1, It was the first time.
1330.1,1336.1," The best flash story ever was actually written for, for the quick silver character that's"
1336.1,1338.1, Marvel's rip off of them.
1338.1,1343.1, And this is basically like if you take a character that can go and we'll let you go back
1343.1,1344.1, on rabbit.
1344.1,1349.1," You take a character that basically moves that rapidly and you take an extended, you know,"
1349.1,1353.1," with that sort of thinking typical of like a mark malar or something, but this was a Peter"
1353.1,1354.1, David's story I'm referring to.
1354.1,1357.1," You say, what would it be like to be this person?"
1357.1,1362.1," And so there's this, he, the whole episode ends up going to his, uh, his like therapist or something and"
1362.1,1365.1," bitching about how, what a horrible, you know,"
1365.1,1368.1," mazantra piste is because you know how we get pissed off, weighten and lines and stuff."
1368.1,1371.1," I mean, his whole world is basically waiting at the DMV."
1371.1,1373.1," Missed a throw up, did you mean to say?"
1373.1,1374.1," Yeah, yeah, I stand there."
1374.1,1375.1," I said, you stuck, got stuck."
1375.1,1376.1, I got stuck there.
1376.1,1377.1, Okay.
1377.1,1378.1, All right.
1378.1,1379.1, Or whatever.
1379.1,1380.1, I'm sure you could tell.
1380.1,1383.1," But so, but it was, I mean, his, he was just this miserable wretch because everyone was,"
1383.1,1387.1," the slowest piece of shit like, you know, like D.W."
1387.1,1391.1," Geo, not John Wall Geriatric or whatever, you know, and every aspect of his life."
1391.1,1394.1," And anyway, but can't he just slow down when he wants to?"
1394.1,1395.1, He doesn't have to always be super fast.
1395.1,1401.1," No, but because if your mind is able to handle the, to, to function at that capacity of let"
1401.1,1406.1," you move that rapidly throughout the world, it stands to reason that it's going to be that that"
1406.1,1408.1," quick in, in every other aspect too."
1408.1,1409.1, True.
1409.1,1412.1," That was the assumption that the, that the, that the writer took."
1412.1,1416.1," But yeah, he, he, he could like, he would read books and like, you know, I split second."
1416.1,1419.1," Like, yeah, that's got to do that all the time."
1419.1,1420.1, Yeah.
1420.1,1421.1," So that's, that is the curse."
1421.1,1424.1," And that was, it was funny because so many curses of flesh."
1424.1,1425.1, That's the last story.
1425.1,1426.1, Wasn't told in the flash.
1426.1,1428.1, And then like the best superman story.
1428.1,1429.1, It wasn't told for Superman.
1429.1,1433.1," It was the, the Samaritan in, after the city, which quicks,"
1433.1,1434.1, that was awesome.
1434.1,1436.1, Since I dropped that is that you have the same thing.
1436.1,1439.1," And you know that if you sleep for a moment or go on top,"
1439.1,1442.1," you're going to tap, let us lean or whatever that like you could have saved, you know,"
1442.1,1443.1, that's number rules.
1443.1,1444.1, Right.
1444.1,1445.1, That's right.
1445.1,1446.1, The Samaritan could like never rest.
1446.1,1447.1, Yeah.
1447.1,1448.1, I remember that story.
1448.1,1449.1, Okay.
1449.1,1451.1," So Ryan, so Ryan has to tell you last."
1451.1,1452.1, Bring it back.
1452.1,1453.1, Bring it back.
1453.1,1454.1, All right.
1454.1,1455.1, So anyway.
1455.1,1456.1, Sorry.
1456.1,1460.1, So this new horrible flash series is cancelled and they're
1460.1,1464.1, referting to the original series numbering with Mark Wade back on the book.
1464.1,1465.1," Ah, good."
1465.1,1466.1," Mark, wait."
1466.1,1467.1, Okay.
1467.1,1468.1," But how did they fuck up the flash, seriously?"
1468.1,1474.1," They introduced a new, well, they, they, they, they put a new character in the role."
1474.1,1476.1, And he didn't really work that well.
1476.1,1478.1, You mean a whole brand new flash?
1478.1,1483.1," Well, they promoted kids flash into the, that's the full fucking problem with all of DC's"
1483.1,1484.1, comics.
1484.1,1486.1, There's like six billion versions of every character.
1486.1,1487.1, This was why.
1487.1,1488.1," No, like you know, the flash."
1488.1,1489.1, How many of you are there?
1489.1,1491.1, There's like a billion different.
1491.1,1493.1, There's like kid versions in the same Superman.
1493.1,1494.1, There's a goddamn dog in the cape.
1494.1,1497.1," Girls, ripped of this women who can't just have Batman,"
1497.1,1500.1," you have to have Batman, you have to have Batman, you have to have Batman."
1500.1,1501.1, You have to have Batman.
1501.1,1504.1, Do you see comics is fucking trash?
1504.1,1505.1, There you do.
1505.1,1506.1, Batman.
1506.1,1508.1, All the marbled into member right.
1508.1,1511.1," I was pointing out there was like a girl Wolverine or whatever, like a pale."
1511.1,1512.1, Lace.
1512.1,1513.1, Yeah.
1513.1,1517.1," The spider girl, they did the web with what was girl Wolverine called."
1517.1,1518.1, It was like he was called.
1518.1,1520.1, Like a no X32 or 23 years.
1520.1,1521.1, There's a lot of that.
1521.1,1522.1, That's what I'm saying.
1522.1,1524.1," Wait, what, who's a, who's a, who's a, who's a."
1524.1,1526.1, Green lantern right now.
1526.1,1528.1," The green of well, the main green lantern."
1528.1,1529.1, Who is it?
1529.1,1530.1, It's a house.
1530.1,1531.1," Back to hell, George."
1531.1,1532.1," Oh, it's him again."
1532.1,1533.1, Yeah.
1533.1,1534.1, Awesome.
1534.1,1537.1," So basically, I left comic books for like 10 years and nothing is fucking happened."
1537.1,1541.1," Well, that was another similar thing where they, everyone hated the, like, green lantern before."
1541.1,1542.1, Bring it all back.
1542.1,1543.1, Bring it all back.
1543.1,1544.1, Right.
1544.1,1546.1, I wasn't never coming back because he was like dead forever.
1546.1,1548.1," Well, they figured out how to undy."
1548.1,1549.1, Yeah.
1549.1,1550.1, They never do it.
1550.1,1551.1, What are we talking about?
1551.1,1552.1," No, you're not open."
1552.1,1553.1, This is totally the meander cast.
1553.1,1555.1, I don't even think that's all right.
1555.1,1558.1," Yeah, we get, we're, we're, we're, we're talking about El Sim City."
1558.1,1562.1," I was saying I'm, I'm hoping that this sort of carries across like when when you were"
1562.1,1566.1," I watch Cherokee's don't give a shit about what you do, but I don't really give a shit about"
1566.1,1567.1, Star Trek.
1567.1,1568.1, Although I know that they do some really good stuff.
1568.1,1569.1, I don't know shit about Star Trek.
1569.1,1570.1, But put that on me.
1570.1,1571.1, You can watch it.
1571.1,1574.1, And it's still an interesting window into that you can laugh it.
1574.1,1578.1," So if someone's laughing at our expense and saying like, it hasn't turned our show."
1578.1,1580.1, I can fest to watching seven seasons of Gilmour Girls.
1580.1,1581.1, That's true.
1581.1,1587.1," And you don't have a Captain Pike Gold cart, whatever, man."
1587.1,1589.1," I, I blame my wife and kid."
1589.1,1591.1, I only watch it with them.
1591.1,1592.1, It's okay.
1592.1,1593.1, So.
1593.1,1601.1," Some city societies is like the flash, which is like Empire Strikes Back."
1601.1,1602.1, Let's bring it home.
1602.1,1603.1, Did you make it?
1603.1,1605.1, It's either even more girls or Empire Strikes Back.
1605.1,1606.1, We don't know.
1606.1,1607.1, We'll find out right.
1607.1,1608.1," Any, any fine words?"
1608.1,1609.1," Oh, my."
1609.1,1610.1, I know.
1610.1,1611.1, Okay.
1611.1,1612.1, Here's a random.
1612.1,1616.1, This is what happens when we try to redo a conversation we had last week.
1616.1,1617.1, So let's not even try that again.
1617.1,1622.1," Since we're rampant, I got like probably the fastest now playing ever."
1622.1,1623.1," No, I'm like, go for it."
1623.1,1624.1, Okay.
1624.1,1626.1, I was going to avoid this because I'm playing Battlefield 2 again.
1626.1,1630.1," I'm also playing World and Conflict very heavily, but I'm not going to talk about it now because"
1630.1,1631.1, to pimped the one up show.
1631.1,1636.1," I just don't want it to be, you know, where people watch that and listen to us or like,"
1636.1,1639.1," hey, that motherfucker said the same thing, you know, four days ago."
1639.1,1640.1, Right.
1640.1,1644.1," So, but Battlefield 2, the best part of my week in a sitting there in a, oh, God, and I really"
1644.1,1646.1, just say that the best part of my week in.
1646.1,1651.1," So I guess we'll have the time to sit there and in, well, she's gone for two months."
1651.1,1655.1," Well, just, you know, her family with her family, but trying to get you in trouble."
1655.1,1656.1," So, no, but that explains why."
1656.1,1659.1," I'm going to be doing some serious, you got another brief time now."
1659.1,1660.1, Currently.
1660.1,1664.1," But we're sitting there playing the map, Moshter City and all the audio were on the"
1664.1,1667.1," the mid east coalition side, and all the audio is in Arabic."
1667.1,1668.1," So, we just keep hearing."
1668.1,1669.1, Duntanyan.
1669.1,1670.1, Duntanyan.
1670.1,1675.1," And I heard it enough because the commander keeps, it means something has to do with something"
1675.1,1680.1," when you cite a, you know, spotted sniper spotted or whatever, if she spotted."
1680.1,1682.1," And he just kept saying it and I like, in my head, I'm hearing it."
1682.1,1684.1," I'm like, Duntanyan."
1684.1,1690.1," So, all of a sudden, like, in team speakers, like, doing tan, duntan, duntanyan, duntanyan,"
1690.1,1693.1," duntanyan, duntanyan, duntanyan."
1693.1,1697.1," And then, like, so after her, he had talked, it was like, duntanyan, duntanyan."
1697.1,1701.1," And then, like, we're just doing this for like about an hour."
1701.1,1705.1," And then, one of us, like, that's how, that's how little a little bit like, he"
1705.1,1707.1, grew school song to me.
1707.1,1708.1, Dianna.
1708.1,1709.1, Trying to throw that right.
1709.1,1712.1, I didn't close her behind Cox being on the spot of that.
1712.1,1716.1," Dianna, I could've busted into Dianna now."
1716.1,1718.1," So, here's some Dianna."
1718.1,1719.1, Dianna.
1719.1,1722.1," I can't do it, but I just can't do it."
1722.1,1723.1," Yeah, I, sorry."
1723.1,1724.1, All right.
1724.1,1726.1," That was a speed, speed, now playing."
1726.1,1730.1," But, as anybody, while we're at it, as anybody else been playing anything."
1730.1,1731.1, Yes.
1731.1,1732.1, There's a flat stone.
1732.1,1733.1," What have you been, guys?"
1733.1,1734.1, Okay.
1734.1,1737.1," So, ever, ever on the, on the indie beat, I found a game called"
1737.1,1740.1," crayon physics, which you can find at clunygames.com."
1740.1,1741.1, Has been George?
1741.1,1742.1, Sadly now.
1742.1,1743.1, Okay.
1743.1,1745.1, K-L-O-O-N-I-G-A-M-U-S.
1745.1,1748.1," So, this guy, he actually has, he does a really cool job."
1748.1,1754.1," Every month or so, he has a, he publishes a game that he puts together in, like, a week."
1754.1,1758.1, And he has a lot of different creative things he's done over the past couple months.
1758.1,1763.1," And this one, basically, you, the art style, it's like you're working on a piece of construction paper or something."
1763.1,1769.1," And you have to get a, a little red ball from one end to the other of the, one part of the screen to the other."
1769.1,1771.1," In order to do that, you actually draw objects on screen."
1771.1,1774.1," So, you're actually creating physical objects that appear in the world."
1774.1,1776.1," So, you want to, you draw a rectangle."
1776.1,1779.1, If you draw a big rectangle that adds weight to it and drops on a beam.
1779.1,1781.1," And you want, basically, it's, it's, it's kind of like,"
1781.1,1785.1," It's kind of like a Google run a little, oh, a scene like a rub Goldberg line, right?"
1785.1,1787.1," It's kind of, you know, kind of, yeah."
1787.1,1791.1," So, basically, the thing is, like, you're basically creating all the things the environment on the fly and it's just, you know,"
1791.1,1792.1," It's the same kind of kinds of this line, right?"
1792.1,1793.1, Or that kind of stuff.
1793.1,1797.1," That's totally cool though, if it's just drawing something and having it, like, do something, yes,"
1797.1,1798.1, and they'd be a physical character.
1798.1,1801.1," Is all the pieces out there will, will tell us."
1801.1,1803.1, It's like Harold and the purple crayon a little bit.
1803.1,1804.1, Is that Harold?
1804.1,1805.1," Wait, is this, what?"
1805.1,1806.1," Here's the, what?"
1806.1,1809.1," That's different, assignment in the land of chalk drawings, right?"
1809.1,1810.1," Yeah, yeah."
1810.1,1811.1, Yeah.
1811.1,1812.1, I don't know what that is.
1812.1,1813.1," No, I do remember that."
1813.1,1816.1," Because I, oh, you know, my name is Simon, then the name is Draw Come True."
1816.1,1817.1," Yeah, yeah."
1817.1,1818.1," Yeah, because I always, I still had that song enough."
1818.1,1822.1," I was like, after a while, I was wondering if that shit was like my imaginary friend,"
1822.1,1823.1," or if that was really, that was real."
1823.1,1824.1, That was real.
1824.1,1827.1," You know, my name is Simon."
1827.1,1829.1," I was like, oh, I'm true."
1829.1,1830.1, Yeah.
1830.1,1833.1," It was like, I was like, I was like, I was like a segment for, like,"
1833.1,1835.1," like, Captain King of Rewords and Krabs."
1835.1,1838.1," It was on PBS, I remember it was like, with the letter people and there was,"
1838.1,1839.1," Bill X-Combin, a literature company."
1839.1,1842.1, Bill Cosby had some magic kind of crayon too.
1842.1,1843.1," Oh, yeah, picture pages."
1843.1,1844.1," Oh, those also."
1844.1,1845.1, That's the fun with picture pages.
1845.1,1848.1," What's the hard work you brought to you, I'm your, your kids."
1848.1,1853.1," You guys, well, you all don't have to remember the thing where you got the thing that you put it on your TV screen"
1853.1,1854.1, and then you drew.
1854.1,1855.1, You had to start the show.
1855.1,1860.1, I think you remembered because you had a daughter who was young enough to wanted at the time.
1860.1,1861.1," Probably, right?"
1861.1,1862.1, What?
1862.1,1863.1, I don't know what that is.
1863.1,1864.1, What?
1864.1,1866.1," You had a daughter, okay, as in offspring."
1866.1,1867.1, Yes.
1867.1,1868.1, You still have her.
1868.1,1872.1," And at the time, that that, she was on the TV screen."
1872.1,1873.1, She was at the age of the age.
1873.1,1874.1," No, no, no, no."
1874.1,1875.1, Watch what you want to say.
1875.1,1876.1, I was a kid.
1876.1,1877.1," Daddy, I want to."
1877.1,1878.1," No, when I was a kid."
1878.1,1879.1, Okay.
1879.1,1880.1, This is back.
1880.1,1881.1, I can't remember.
1881.1,1885.1," There's any, like, you know, 40 is listeners out there."
1885.1,1889.1, You remember the name of this TV show where you put this thing on top of your screen.
1889.1,1890.1, It's a screen paper.
1890.1,1891.1, That's right.
1891.1,1893.1, It was like a Vince parent thing and you would draw.
1893.1,1894.1," Yeah, what's saying?"
1894.1,1896.1," Okay, kids, now draw a big circle on the screen."
1896.1,1899.1, I used to do that on my own because paper would stick because of the static.
1899.1,1901.1," That was, it's your pages."
1901.1,1902.1, Really?
1902.1,1903.1, It worked like the same way.
1903.1,1907.1," It was like, cellophane just kind of like, yeah, except, you know, occasionally the dumb"
1907.1,1909.1, kid at home wouldn't actually have the same.
1909.1,1911.1, They were supposed to buy and they would just draw.
1911.1,1912.1, Right.
1912.1,1914.1, She wanted pretty quick that.
1914.1,1915.1, Was it for you that dumb kid?
1915.1,1916.1," Yeah, I was."
1916.1,1917.1, What?
1917.1,1918.1, What?
1918.1,1919.1, What?
1919.1,1920.1, What?
1920.1,1921.1, What?
1921.1,1922.1, What?
1922.1,1923.1, What?
1924.1,1925.1, Lips.
1925.1,1926.1, Coffee grounds.
1926.1,1927.1, Mommy?
1927.1,1928.1," Yeah, I used my brother's lipstick."
1928.1,1929.1," Pull, pull, go."
1929.1,1931.1, My brother's lipstick.
1931.1,1935.1," Well, that's from like, you know, America's funniest videos."
1935.1,1937.1, There's always the video.
1937.1,1940.1, The disaster scene where the parent takes a tour of their house.
1940.1,1944.1," And then it always like concludes with like a shot of the kid covered in either, you know,"
1944.1,1948.1," house paint, lipstick or there's like moms, maxi pads are all over the wall."
1948.1,1950.1, And the kids like airplane stickers.
1950.1,1954.1," They're like, or the DVD players follow up me, or whatever."
1954.1,1955.1, Right.
1955.1,1959.1," Or the dog did it, you know, like the whole house isn't shreds."
1959.1,1960.1, Just like Sim City.
1960.1,1962.1, Just like crayon physics.
1962.1,1968.1," So hey, it's rumored that the cast of GFW is considering putting together a podcast about PC games."
1968.1,1969.1, Really?
1969.1,1970.1, That's a vision.
1970.1,1972.1, That's the on topic podcast.
1972.1,1974.1, We do that every Friday.
1974.1,1977.1, We played that joke and everyone was like asking for it.
1977.1,1979.1, Where's the podcast about the PC games?
1979.1,1980.1, The joke.
1980.1,1983.1," You know, actually there's a podcast about like off topic stuff."
1983.1,1984.1, I see there you go.
1984.1,1985.1, You see the blues just go.
1985.1,1988.1, I get the ideas you're doing on purpose.
1988.1,1989.1, I don't know.
1989.1,1990.1, I have the irony levels.
1990.1,1991.1, I know.
1991.1,1992.1, I really love those two things.
1992.1,1993.1, Yeah.
1993.1,1994.1, I can't work my way out of that one.
1994.1,1995.1, That's how I do it.
1995.1,1997.1, I honestly have no idea what we were talking about.
1997.1,1998.1, I don't either.
1998.1,1999.1, Why do you play?
1999.1,2004.1," We got a game that's very, that they reminded us of all these dumb drawing things."
2004.1,2005.1, I think winky dink.
2005.1,2006.1, That's what it was.
2006.1,2007.1, Stop.
2007.1,2008.1, That was the name of the show.
2008.1,2009.1, The next thing we're going to be drinking.
2009.1,2010.1, Drinking.
2010.1,2011.1, We did.
2011.1,2012.1, We did.
2012.1,2013.1, We did.
2013.1,2014.1, We did.
2014.1,2015.1, We did.
2015.1,2016.1, We did.
2016.1,2017.1, We can firm.
2017.1,2018.1, That's my turn.
2018.1,2020.1, Confirm with me out there that the show was caught winky dink.
2020.1,2021.1, Okay.
2021.1,2023.1, Is anybody else playing anything other than Pacman on the Xbox library?
2023.1,2024.1, I was playing.
2024.1,2027.1," Well, this is a console game, but it has ties to the PC."
2027.1,2029.1, I was playing Prince of Persia classic.
2029.1,2030.1, Oh.
2030.1,2032.1, Me too.
2032.1,2034.1, Which it's on Xbox library.
2034.1,2035.1, Totally faithful.
2035.1,2036.1, Yep.
2037.1,2039.1, It's a remake of the original Prince of Persia.
2039.1,2040.1, Looks good.
2040.1,2041.1," It looks awesome, right?"
2041.1,2042.1, It does look really good.
2042.1,2046.1, I want now it's time for out of this world and flashback classic.
2046.1,2047.1, Hardcore of the game.
2047.1,2048.1, I agree to.
2048.1,2049.1, Yeah.
2049.1,2050.1, That level of ant.
2050.1,2052.1," I mean, is it animate that smoothly, too?"
2052.1,2053.1, Yes.
2053.1,2054.1, For all the.
2054.1,2056.1, That was all wrote a scope back in the right.
2056.1,2057.1, Right.
2057.1,2058.1, So do they do the equivalent of that?
2058.1,2059.1," I mean, now they all like they're not wrote."
2059.1,2060.1," Scoping is a 3D, right?"
2060.1,2063.1," It's it's presented as 2D, but it's 3D graphic."
2063.1,2064.1, 3D on a 2D.
2064.1,2065.1, And it's still.
2065.1,2068.1, But you and you still character from the new games that bad Prince.
2068.1,2069.1, They use that.
2069.1,2070.1, Yeah.
2070.1,2071.1, He doesn't play that guy.
2071.1,2072.1, Cool.
2072.1,2074.1," But do they still obsess over the animation, although it's clearly not"
2074.1,2075.1," Rota scope, or they still."
2075.1,2077.1, Does it have that degree of fluidity?
2077.1,2079.1," Where everything is, you know, this just really just."
2079.1,2080.1, I think it was really.
2080.1,2082.1, I'm sweeping in just room.
2082.1,2083.1, It looks the same to me.
2083.1,2086.1," Not the same, but it looks fluid in that way."
2086.1,2087.1, Yeah.
2087.1,2090.1," It's still a great game, but the thing that struck me this weekend when I was playing."
2090.1,2093.1," It was like, I guess I just forgot how unforgiving."
2093.1,2095.1, And Prince of Persia is as a game.
2095.1,2098.1," I mean, you do get the kind of the warning if you're getting to the edge."
2098.1,2099.1, You get that.
2099.1,2100.1, Whoa.
2100.1,2101.1, Sort of thing.
2101.1,2107.1," But there are just I slipped and fell into, you know, down eight flights and smashed my body."
2107.1,2111.1," I don't know how many times just from, you know, one little slip of the control."
2111.1,2114.1, Does it start you the very beginning of the level once you do that?
2114.1,2115.1," Well, there are check points."
2115.1,2116.1, Yeah.
2116.1,2117.1, There's checkpoints.
2117.1,2118.1," But you lose a life, you know."
2118.1,2119.1," I mean, you lose."
2119.1,2120.1, It counts against your time.
2120.1,2121.1," Oh, and against your time."
2121.1,2122.1, Yeah.
2122.1,2124.1, It's a lot of old games.
2124.1,2125.1, I would like that though.
2125.1,2127.1," Otherwise, you'd build a blow through him in 30 minutes."
2127.1,2128.1," Oh, old games are like that."
2128.1,2129.1, Yeah.
2129.1,2130.1, He hated you.
2130.1,2133.1," And actually, they do put a couple of little new kind of cheats on there."
2133.1,2137.1," There's this little like twinkly, glowy butterfly thing."
2137.1,2140.1," The sort of like tells you where to go, which is sort of annoying."
2140.1,2141.1, It's called Navi.
2141.1,2142.1, It goes.
2142.1,2143.1, Hey.
2143.1,2144.1, It's a little bit like that.
2144.1,2145.1, Yeah.
2145.1,2146.1, Look at.
2146.1,2147.1, Look at.
2147.1,2149.1, It's way.
2149.1,2150.1, Yeah.
2150.1,2153.1, The last fight is also changed.
2153.1,2154.1," Oh, yeah."
2154.1,2155.1, Yeah.
2155.1,2157.1, The combat feels a little harder to me this time.
2157.1,2162.1, That my imagination seems like there's more moves now than there were.
2162.1,2164.1," Oh, you should avoid the combat."
2164.1,2165.1, As a void the combat.
2165.1,2166.1, You can use the guy.
2166.1,2171.1," You can use a move where like if you carry the dudes, sort of,"
2171.1,2175.1," if you're like right next to him, you can switch positions with him."
2175.1,2176.1," Oh, okay."
2176.1,2177.1," So, and then run to the side."
2177.1,2179.1," As proven in flash 2016,"
2179.1,2182.1, the third installment sometimes simply running.
2182.1,2184.1, And he's waiting for a superior stopping to fight.
2184.1,2185.1, Quint a Bible verse there.
2185.1,2187.1, You run very fast.
2187.1,2189.1, Flash 2016.
2189.1,2190.1, You call you two.
2190.1,2193.1, And then there's Pac-Man.
2193.1,2195.1, And then there's Pac-Man.
2195.1,2196.1, I don't really want to go on it.
2196.1,2198.1, Then there's the backman.
2198.1,2199.1, But I'm so freaking out.
2199.1,2200.1, I'm there with you now.
2200.1,2206.1, Last night was the first time in days that I went to bed before 1 a.m.
2207.1,2208.1, Because of Pac-Man.
2208.1,2211.1, Pac-Man has been keeping me up until the wee hours.
2211.1,2213.1," I understand Jeff, don't worry."
2213.1,2214.1, I don't know what it is.
2214.1,2216.1, I can't take it.
2216.1,2217.1, It's awesome.
2217.1,2220.1, It's something about the shortness of the game.
2220.1,2222.1, The five minute championship mode.
2222.1,2225.1, Plus the fact that you can see all your friend scores.
2225.1,2226.1, That's the big thing.
2226.1,2227.1, Yeah.
2227.1,2230.1, And because like you can see exactly how to be perfect in it.
2230.1,2232.1," So like you just strive for that every time you're like,"
2232.1,2233.1," oh, crap."
2233.1,2234.1, I screwed that up.
2235.1,2236.1, I'm saying I got a little bit of a allergy.
2236.1,2237.1, And it's time for that.
2237.1,2238.1, And I just got to corner that little better.
2238.1,2242.1, And you make that one mistake and you just want to start all over.
2242.1,2244.1, Pac-Man.
2244.1,2245.1, Awesome.
2245.1,2246.1, The awesome Pac-Man.
2246.1,2248.1, I need to get it.
2248.1,2249.1, I need to get it.
2249.1,2250.1, I need to get it.
2250.1,2251.1, There's also that.
2251.1,2252.1, What was it?
2252.1,2254.1, The motion right simulator that I didn't play.
2254.1,2256.1, But I watched your mom playing.
2256.1,2258.1, Basically.
2258.1,2261.1, That was the tall arcade.
2261.1,2263.1, They had like a ride simulator.
2263.1,2268.46, sloping bed that you basically lay back on and you hold on and there are two in tandem and then you watch the movie of the roller coaster
2268.46,2274.06," I've seen this thing. Yeah, you could choose between like the hell ride roller coaster like you know the clown roller coaster"
2274.06,2283.98, Whatever you want but when I saw when I saw on this thing was like a couple for like you know a gross weight of I don't I don't know
2285.46,2290.8199999999997," What did I guess last time a quarter of a ton? No, no, that would be each so half ton right. Yeah"
2290.82,2292.82, You have to have to find a half ton
2293.78,2300.0800000000004, But when this thing when this bad dad started kicking like the woman and she was in head to toe purple and wearing
2300.7000000000003,2305.76, Birkin stock so it was just that firming the theory that like kicking you know like
2305.94,2311.7000000000003, Bacon bread foot stuff with the whole ride. I was just like it was amazing because it reminded me of
2312.42,2314.9," Hell a water bed in an earthquake, but"
2315.9,2322.2000000000003," My can it was too dark in there to take a picture, but there's this there's another game that is good enough to call now playing"
2322.2000000000003,2326.86, And it's basically a roulette wheel with five slots on it and a rubber ball that goes round and
2327.7400000000002,2331.62, Here I took a little sample of what this thing sounds like as
2332.3,2334.3, I'm just gonna play it as
2334.6600000000003,2339.12, As the balls and rotation and then it evades the sound file will end when the ball stops
2340.94,2342.94, Here we go
2344.9,2346.9, Oh
2350.7000000000003,2354.84," So you can tell it's pretty catchy right there. No, right for it. Wait for it"
2361.3,2367.6, And at that point you win 50 75 100 100 tickets
2367.6,2369.6, Um
2373.6,2378.36," Well, no, if you bet on blue if you bet on you just shit out a lot, but you play small two bets"
2378.36,2383.08, So many smart persons looking at this thing. You like all right. I'm gonna bet on every color
2383.4,2389.62," So that way I win every time yeah, but yeah, but but then you know the long story short"
2389.62,2392.7, I don't want you to take it's in a basically got me a
2393.4,2395.4, Not so many tipsy rules
2397.6,2402.48," Yes, that's a story. At least you have to tell you rolls better than achievement points. That's true"
2404.92,2408.88," You can't eat a team points. Yeah, I never liked to see rolls though"
2409.48,2412.06," I didn't you know, I just start giving the tickets away to kids"
2412.06,2414.4," They get all excited. Yeah, they get psyched if you do that"
2414.52,2419.74," They do the kids like oh yeah, because today the class like a wippy cushion or like Chinese finger cups"
2419.74,2424.16, You know all that shit that they're there that comes from a you know whatever the sweatshops
2424.16,2429.48, It's like stuff still fun for the water snakes water we need one super ball last hours
2429.48,2434.8799999999997, We still get into the water. All that red until it bounces over their neighbors. They did have I almost got it
2434.8799999999997,2439.3199999999997, But I decided not to for 600 tickets they had a toilet with a dancing piece of shit in it
2443.56,2448.7, And it basically you know you could choose between a baby blue or a pink toilet and it was tempting
2448.7,2452.16, I saw 600 tickets just like the grand prize no
2452.16,2457.3999999999996," No, they had a wee there and at first I was so dumb. I knew I knew this shit was a scam because like I"
2457.68,2461.8199999999997, Actually stopped and did it double-taken. I was like I I'm gonna play. I'm gonna play
2461.8199999999997,2465.96," You know thinking I'm gonna like keep playing that roulette shit for a week that look it was 70,000"
2466.64,2468.64, How much money would you have?
2468.64,2470.64, The math on that like yeah
2470.64,2476.14," So 70,000 tickets for the Wii and 600 for the dancing yeah, and then keep in mind that roulette game is about as"
2476.14,2481.7799999999997," Genesis they get in those shit holes. I mean most of them you'll be lucky, you know, ski ball or something get yourself five tickets per"
2482.5,2483.5, game

2493.1,2495.1, And crispens office or your office or something
2495.66,2497.66, You shit hoarders

2954.06,2957.1, Tell it's actually reminds me remember a week or two ago
2957.58,2960.14, When we all went out to lunch and we went to that new
2960.7,2964.22," Lunch place or it was new to me. I guess it's been there for six years, but I'm not sure"
2964.22,2968.94," I don't ever notice anything. That's called working girls cafe. Well, I put that on my"
2969.8199999999997,2971.8199999999997, My charge card and
2971.82,2977.26," Yeah, I'm a few days ago my wife like yeah because uh hey Jeff there's this charge"
2978.1400000000003,2980.86, On the credit card statement for working girls
2982.3,2986.54, What is that about and you like half a second house like oh fuck
2988.1400000000003,2989.98, You're trying to remember what an idea
2989.98,2991.82, What did I do that website?
2991.82,2995.42, It's gonna remember God is a sandwich place. So I'm so I'm so clear
2995.82,2998.78," Okay, I didn't know what you could actually get for eight dollars, but"
3000.46,3001.7400000000002, Nice
3001.8199999999997,3003.8199999999997," Yeah, coupon"
3003.8199999999997,3005.8199999999997, Actually it was salami that's what I got
3007.1,3013.74," I run I owe okay, so uh so this does clearly pop you right? Yeah, you know, I do find the list to be a little"
3014.4599999999996,3019.74, Dubious if I may say I mean I believe that all these things have as many subscribers as they're saying
3020.06,3024.8599999999997, But you probably need to separate list where it's actually just like games that are about
3025.8999999999996,3028.9399999999996," No, you a list cater to you like ignore the facts"
3028.94,3030.94, That's caterer list to like jacriines desires
3032.14,3034.14," Yes, I"
3034.14,3039.1, Well paid subscribers are like you know users that actually have to like drop money on like a monthly fee
3039.1,3041.5," Sure, sure that would be a more yeah, that's a fair one"
3041.5,3043.34, Because this is gonna apples and oranges in a way
3043.5,3045.5, Guy online is a forum
3045.5,3047.9," Well, right exactly and webkins"
3047.9,3052.3, I mean that thing is like you buy after buy a plush toy a store and then register the thing
3052.3,3054.54, And then then you get the new plus toy also
3054.54,3058.62, That website I guess I did we watch the video damn that thing was like I've frickin
3058.62,3062.7799999999997, Assad trip but put that page put that in your browser and then do the tour click the tour
3062.7799999999997,3066.8599999999997," Yeah, it's like these horrible like day glow colors with these like creepy stuff"
3066.8599999999997,3069.2599999999998, Animals are freaking me out. It was like watching tell the talk
3069.2599999999998,3074.94, What it's like if you give that simply by watching it your kid might accidentally cost you another like seven or hundred
3074.94,3078.2999999999997, $800 just so by doing their own thing
3078.2999999999997,3080.2999999999997, I think I'm also gonna be in my nightmares tonight
3080.8599999999997,3085.9," Yeah, I'm surprised what you're your parent. I mean you're you're beyond the years of worrying about that"
3085.98,3088.2999999999997," Yeah, you know, but like just seems I don't know"
3088.62,3091.66, Sarah it seems like you wouldn't want your kid going in these things
3091.66,3097.58," Well, she was in Neo pets and then she was in Disney's Tune Town for a while which are both versions of these things"
3097.58,3101.98, How how closely supervised are they well? They're very closely supervised. They're actually pretty
3102.7799999999997,3104.7799999999997, They all do a great job of
3105.5,3111.1, Making it really impossible for your kid to be talked to less that date like camera crew
3112.06,3117.74," Yeah, no, I mean obviously I mean all kidding aside that stuff is is crucially important"
3117.8199999999997,3124.8599999999997," Yeah, they really have that kind of that there's no way anybody can yeah like there's no chat function"
3125.02,3125.8199999999997," Right, you know"
3125.8199999999997,3131.5, It's interesting. I was almost just because you have to I mean you have to have a GM and any any kind of like MMO
3131.5,3136.4599999999996, But it seems like in that you have to have so much supervision that that along would would necessitate you're having the
3136.62,3141.3399999999997, To charge or either that or just load it up with advertising which is I think is how it works. I bet you
3141.9799999999996,3145.58, Those things are just it's the typical channel one stuff about you know
3145.74,3150.86, You have channel one in schools where basically a school if the school's gonna get like uniforms for their football TV or something
3150.86,3155.18, They have to agree to like show why this channel one shit and it's increasingly just a bunch of you know
3155.34,3158.86, Advertisements and some such so I'm just guessing that that you know
3159.5,3161.5, It's a guest but the other other
3161.5,3162.86, other kid
3162.86,3164.22, Web
3164.22,3165.5, That's the problem
3165.5,3168.54, I had and hollow a tower just like loaded up with
3169.2599999999998,3173.02," Right, adds everywhere and I mean and certainly the fact the second life is on this list"
3173.74,3175.74," Yeah, that's the whole list in the question"
3176.22,3180.22, What that's that's not a game that means that I don't know consistency present
3181.1,3183.1, So it's your definition of game
3184.38,3185.58, I don't know
3185.58,3187.58, Not that
3187.58,3188.86, Not second life right
3189.74,3190.78, Okay
3190.78,3196.54, We have anything else this week my my oh god this sucks my mic just keeps going in and out really when I turn
3196.54,3199.66," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure it is I if I hold up the cord"
3200.38,3202.38, It's just a right angle
3202.38,3205.82, You get still hear me really maybe not I don't know we can hear you
3206.46,3211.02," I can hear you all right, I'll just pinch this cord. I think it's just your return is busted"
3212.86,3216.1400000000003, You can't have to be a little creative editing here with the shit
3216.1400000000003,3221.1," No, we could talk people need to know maybe if people I can't work under these conditions"
3221.1,3225.1, You piece of shit do we said like no more burping? I know but we're not recording
3225.5,3228.94, This is going in this is how we do it we air we're like the no stops
3229.02,3232.14, We're the we don't some kind of monster metallic inversion of podcasts
3232.14,3237.58," Well, we're taking my burp out and that yeah, but no I'm staying but uh, no, but people here"
3238.2200000000003,3244.2200000000003, How sad our samples maybe those send us in some you know like some cans to recycle there I go cutting out again
3244.54,3251.7400000000002," Okay, so said hizer if you want to send us some new headphones we could use them that's true. Thanks guys. I didn't ask for my most advice for cans to recycle or"
3252.94,3258.2200000000003," I don't know anything I'll put on eBay new equipment is theoretically on the way. Yeah, yeah"
3258.4599999999996,3263.4199999999996, Check me out. I heard that one before now I'm striking like a a Vogue pose hold my head set together
3265.02,3269.98," All right keep talking all right, so how about this new id this new id technology?"
3270.3799999999997,3276.3799999999997, How about that let's talk about id tech five shall we why can this shall we let's riff on that
3278.14,3280.14, John Carmack
3281.2599999999998,3287.3399999999997, Let's just try to learn where did rocket ship pilot camp right head geek over at
3288.54,3296.3799999999997, Unveiled their new their new technology their new engine and they did it significantly at the apple world wide developers conference
3297.8199999999997,3300.54, Which was a week ago last Monday and
3303.5,3308.62, Whatever we want to say about the id tech actually I don't think any of us have seen it running except on the YouTube video
3308.62,3313.66," Yeah, yeah, so the video we're gonna get a personal demo up at E3 in"
3314.14,3316.14, The lie but for now
3316.54,3318.54, We just have that to go on
3318.54,3324.22, But that that was that was put in the broader context of of apple supposedly
3324.94,3326.62, Getting back into gaming
3326.62,3332.3799999999997, It also you know EAs announcement that they will be bringing about the 2021-42 as well as command and conquer and
3333.8199999999997,3336.14, A few other their prominent games right
3336.14,3342.62, The Mac or but the thing is they aren't actually like rewriting the code or anything like that basically they're inserting something called cider X
3343.2599999999998,3348.22, Which is basically a little wrapper that basically quartz over the PC code into
3349.42,3350.7799999999997, Mac
3350.7799999999997,3354.8599999999997," Oh, yeah, once once they went Intel it I think theoretically became way easier to do that"
3356.06,3358.06, So the question is
3358.06,3360.46, One does this matter does anyone care
3361.5,3364.14, That EA is doing this or that and that it showed this
3365.1,3368.8599999999997, So they're new technology on a Mac first and
3369.18,3373.58, Two is apple orderly getting into gaming again and if they are does that matter?
3374.14,3379.18," Well, I think well actually a part of that conference was that Carmack was saying that it's not I mean"
3379.18,3382.2999999999997, They kind of did that with with Mac to put a point but like
3383.1,3388.3799999999997, Carmack said there that it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna make coding easier for games to come to every platform
3388.3799999999997,3391.58," If he wasn't saying specifically like oh, we're just doing this for the Mac right"
3392.06,3393.02, So I mean
3393.02,3398.22, It tech five game whatever the heck it is could conceivably come up on every platform at the same time
3398.86,3405.34," Yeah, it's just it's not like hey, you know, we're it's next game exclusively and Mac but just the the greater question of if"
3405.66,3408.38, We'll see more and more games available on Mac and and clearly
3408.7,3413.98, You know Blizzard does that and everything and it's is but just we'll we see up a point where
3414.62,3417.9, There is an increasingly large contingent of of
3418.2200000000003,3422.46," Gamers on Mac, you know, and then we get to the problem of what do you call them, you know"
3422.46,3425.26," We're not PC gamers, but they're playing exactly the same game"
3425.26,3427.9, You know what I can't come in games for Windows as we sure
3428.94,3430.94, And we won't be covering them
3432.2200000000003,3437.98, For me became almost a mood point once they let you do a mood on a Mac so like oh on a
3438.54,3443.02, Because if you're gonna buy a Mac the reason isn't because of the games obviously you're really into
3443.5,3445.7400000000002, graphic design you're really into us 10 or you're right to
3446.3799999999997,3447.74, The ability or whatever
3447.74,3452.7799999999997, The funny thing is back in the day that's why you bought an apple to play the games. I mean that's why I have a back way back in the day
3452.7799999999997,3455.58," But that's long on yeah, but you know what I think that"
3456.7799999999997,3461.5, The big question is let's say if I do get battle field 2142 running on the machine and they need this side
3461.5,3465.8199999999997, RX app to get the PC game running on a Mac if it affects the performance at all
3465.8199999999997,3467.4199999999996, I'd be kind of interested to see what it does
3467.5,3473.22," But other than that I mean this whole one else was basically yeah, you know the type of Steve jobs is being like the PT bar in of technology"
3473.2999999999997,3476.74," Showing off, you know, everything stuff that can be done right now"
3477.8599999999997,3483.58, So it's kind of like a bigger deal than it really is but the chip Jeff your perspective out. I was interested to find because you know
3484.1,3486.1, You're you're definitely not
3486.1,3489.7799999999997, Just I mean even though you are a spokesman for for games windows and stuff
3489.7799999999997,3493.62, You're definitely not just to type to pass off the competition just because
3494.58,3498.7799999999997, Or or a competitive platform and the fact that all of us here like you know we gave on
3498.78,3503.1800000000003," On consoles on hand-hills on anything that's got games, you know, but"
3503.42,3506.7400000000002, It was interesting here your perspective is someone who'd been in the business for a long time
3506.7400000000002,3512.9, But also someone that worked specifically with Max and on platform and then and you were like historically
3512.9,3516.5400000000004, There's some stuff you should know about before you get all excited or jumped to conclusions
3516.5400000000004,3522.86," Well, well, my feeling was and yeah, I thank you for actually putting that disclaimer and because because it could be read that way"
3522.86,3524.86, I'm not hating on it because I
3525.42,3530.1, Cuz I'm cuz our magazine is now a little hitting with Microsoft. I should say actually I
3530.58,3537.1200000000003, used to be a big maclover actually we have a two max in our house. I love to death my iPod
3537.94,3539.94, reproducing this podcast
3541.06,3543.06," Well, we actually"
3543.06,3547.78," Design our magazine on unmacks, so we all have I have a mac and my desk along with my PC"
3548.06,3552.38," So you know, let's just say that to get that out of the way, but"
3553.1800000000003,3555.1800000000003," Yeah, prior to working at"
3555.82,3558.54, What used to be called computer gaming world. I worked at a
3559.3,3567.34," Mac week magazine, which is a nat de funct mac and touch business magazine, so that was actually serious work before all this stuff and"
3569.2200000000003,3575.76," Over the years, you know as Darren implied boy the sand is really kind of goofing on goofy here"
3575.76,3580.5," It's probably me rustling because I have to keep manipulating this wire. Okay, so here"
3581.02,3583.86," Anything else find and work matters, but that's fine"
3583.86,3585.86, All right
3585.86,3587.86, they
3587.86,3591.74, Apple historically like every every couple of years or few years or whatever
3591.86,3595.82, They make some big pronouncement about how this now we're gonna take game serious
3595.82,3603.42," We realize the audience is out there, you know, and we're you know, and the apple the the mac is the best platform by far for a game"
3603.42,3609.7," So we're gonna show you why and then you know, and they've done that even they've even come around to CGW and in the past"
3609.7,3616.54," Not since we've been GFW, but you know, we would have meetings where apple would come in and sort of prove to us how how this time"
3616.54,3619.7799999999997," They meant it and then you know you never hear from again, right?"
3620.18,3625.5," What's it probably good this is and that's sort of yeah, that's what I think it's gonna happen here and that's just based on"
3626.2599999999998,3628.74, It's not to be overly cynical. It's just that I think
3629.62,3634.3399999999997, That they don't actually really they historically have not ever really given a shit about games
3634.3399999999997,3638.02, You really do have to go all the way back to the apple to to find them
3638.74,3644.34, Really having cared about it. I think during the crucial time that the mac and tosh was developing
3644.74,3649.98, When it was the mac plus and then all the others that they really were had this kind of like a
3650.38,3655.14, Hit brother sort of like please take a seriously where a business machine really?
3655.14,3662.9, We're not just a toy right and you know when they were seriously competing for market share against the PC at the time
3663.46,3670.1, Before kind of just essentially giving that up and being happy with the graphic artist market and
3670.9,3676.1800000000003," And that kind of stuff in video editing so and at that time, you know"
3676.82,3679.46, Even at Mac Week we used to go to them and we used to
3680.34,3686.94, We used to talk to them about gaming and they would really poo it. I mean to the point where like they wouldn't even want us to like
3687.26,3691.2200000000003, We weren't just sitting stories about how like even way back then in those days
3692.18,3697.58, games a lot of game development with being done on Macs for PC games
3697.58,3701.22, These would be games that would not actually be appearing on the Mac itself
3701.22,3708.02, But they're being developed that way and we would want to do stories on that in the magazine and they would try to get us to not do those stories
3708.2599999999998,3713.4199999999996," They were like well, you know, your your readers are more interested in the Mac as a business application"
3713.4199999999996,3715.4199999999996, They don't really need to know about this kind of stuff
3715.58,3716.58, So
3716.74,3725.58," Granted that was you know a long time ago now, but still it has forever tainted me to to really believing that they're actually gonna get behind it"
3725.58,3728.58, I mean in them and really the basic fact now is like who
3729.22,3731.2999999999997, Seriously who would buy a Mac to play games?
3731.2999999999997,3737.14," Yeah, no at this point like this point. They're gonna get into games in any way shape or form like their desktop platform"
3737.14,3741.02," It's not where to do it and we have most of their stuff is close case, right?"
3741.82,3743.82, Believe in that and like I
3744.3,3748.78, Would think they would try to do something more like with the iPod early iPhone or something
3748.78,3753.74," They can't help or yeah, I'm able to sense to me right maybe this is just like a step in the hey"
3753.74,3758.62," We're doing games then later they'll unveil something. Well, I mean those lines. I'm not against them doing games"
3758.62,3763.04," I to be honest with you. Well, no, I'm not either. I'm not saying don't do the more to the party the better"
3763.04,3767.1," I'm right I agree that they're not serious. Yeah, I don't know"
3767.1,3771.06, Totally because they had John Carmack there to say hey cross platform
3771.06,3776.06," Yeah, if I'm mistaken actually done that before I mean they've actually had Carmack specifically there before showing off like"
3776.1,3779.8199999999997, Doom three tech back in the day when it'd be surprised. They certainly I mean this is what they do
3779.8199999999997,3784.18," They they have this kind of press conference, you know every so often where they like show this time"
3784.18,3792.18, They mean it and then they never do I mean I'm I'm really glad that there's certain publishers like like Blizzard who put their stuff on the Mac anyway
3792.18,3795.18, I mean certainly I don't I wouldn't want to deny
3796.14,3806.64," Mac gamers of chance to play games, but but I think like holding out hope that Apple really is going to be supporting you and giving you what you want is a pipe dream"
3806.64,3810.02, So you don't think in a couple years are gonna be changing our name to games for OS 10
3812.2599999999998,3814.2599999999998, GFO S10
3814.2599999999998,3816.2599999999998, Where what that was a nice ring the physics
3816.66,3818.8199999999997, We're not against the idea Apple
3819.22,3824.4199999999996," Right games for iPod. Yeah, I mean similar to you before I came here like a"
3824.42,3830.02, Maybe a year ago I was at Mac addict right or the year and a half. I don't think games and Apple even came up once
3830.02,3832.82, We had like a page on gaming in our magazine and it was all
3833.38,3835.7400000000002, We were scrambling to fill it with like as you take home
3837.2200000000003,3839.2200000000003, Kind of like us now. Yeah
3840.98,3842.98," All right, so that enough of Apple"
3843.7400000000002,3853.34," Yeah, that'll do it. It's good to me. There's unfortunately there's not too much to say about it tech five and it's you know outside of the Apple announcement"
3853.34,3854.7000000000003, I mean we showed the demo that they
3855.58,3860.6600000000003," Said that they had assembled quickly, you know, and that it would it would run better with a little more time"
3860.6600000000003,3865.82, And it certainly looked good. I mean there were complaints online that it was more of the old Chris go factor
3866.26,3870.6200000000003, That that you got out of a lot of stuff using it's in just kind of myself in that
3870.6200000000003,3876.98, What around or just you know the the slippery shininess everything and and some some people
3876.98,3883.66, This one I mean you look at the YouTube comments and you know they're they're complaining about you know that they're noticing performance issues in that
3883.66,3885.66," You know, it's like oh god"
3885.66,3894.06," But the cool point the point of the the matters something that that car makes been saying, you know and to us even in our last few times we've interviewed him is that"
3895.34,3898.06," Thanks Jeff, you and your glasses while I talk yeah, that's you"

3910.02,3916.8199999999997, Game worlds in that rather than tiling assets it's basically the mega texture your idea taken to an even greater degree
3916.8199999999997,3923.56, So that you have you know in a 20 how many you know what did he say how many gigs of information wasn't that little demo they showed
3924.48,3933.22," This in the convenience extraordinary amount and and but I mean it was surprisingly low though for the lack of repetition in it, you know"
3933.22,3942.64," It's basically the old make texture thing written again, but with you know that carries over to interior environments everything you know every single prop and object in the world"
3943.7999999999997,3949.68," You could just you know manipulate artists communicate it in any way, you know here see she's fitting and it's not going to be"
3950.24,3952.8799999999997, crushing you know your memory budget or whatever
3953.96,3955.96, So that's the fun part of it

4070.56,4072.56, Friends got hot sis
4073.2,4081.14, Let's you make an all-de-count do so. I can't I honestly like I don't have the the voice craft talents to put this to do this
4081.8,4085.04, Entry justice. You want to give it a shot shown? I'll try because there's that red line of
4085.04,4088.04, Exactly. There's like the second line it is like is just the winner by the way
4088.04,4093.2799999999997," This is the winner with the winner of the CNC fan fiction, but it has but I might be able to actually scratch up extra copies"
4093.2799999999997,4094.2799999999997, So there will be other winners
4094.2799999999997,4100.08, I mean if I could if that actually one copy of this thing I can eventually say that this is probably not the winner that EA would have picked
4100.56,4102.56, Probably not
4102.56,4107.68," Just safe bet. Okay, um, I'll spare the voice. I'll just read it with thin enthusiasm"
4108.8,4113.24," I can well I can do that. Okay, well, there's more we can there's plenty of reading to go. Oh no, that will"
4113.24,4115.24, I don't like
4115.24,4122.639999999999, There's this eggplant colored M2 Bradley vehicle is he sinks into the purple bean bag and grass the 14 inch purple
4122.639999999999,4123.84, Dildo shifter
4123.84,4129.32, He reflects on the nuclear nuclear devastation. He's about to unleash and the cowardly GDI
4130.04,4133.5599999999995, His little love gimp from the night before settles in on a matching bag
4134.24,4140.12, She's not overly attractive or ugly the kind of girl who gets more dates than women on the extreme ends of the beauty spectrum
4140.76,4144.54, She removes the snuffle off of his costume and stairs blankly out when we go
4145.24,4149.08, Wondering if Kane will call again after he drops her off at grandma's
4149.72,4153.92, Kane ignoring her continues to plot his evil as they barreled down the old laughing road
4154.88,4160.08, He shifts into fourth gear and briefly feels a niche in the neather region should have covered his soldier
4160.08,4165.5599999999995, He muses soon everything will be flames and his purple furry toy will be engulfed in the inferno
4165.88,4170.56, His hand squeezes the shifter a little tighter in a smart crosses his diabolical face
4172.4400000000005,4174.4400000000005, So wow
4174.4400000000005,4177.4400000000005, We're declaring that a winner and let it be known
4178.04,4184.64, This is the first that any of us have read past the second line. I think it was like the stick shifter image that like that they kind of made it
4185.4800000000005,4188.900000000001," Yes, so here's some more if there may be some choice lines from the other ones that you"
4189.56,4195.280000000001, That made them stand out. Okay. Well from let me see there is problems some of these dudes got so they win do it
4195.28,4197.28, They wrote us damn nobles
4198.28,4203.28," Yeah, these guys, yeah, we were asked for I was hoping for like a paragraph or two from people and some guys just got went way off the deep in"
4204.04,4205.04, So
4205.04,4210.32, Some of them it's like they just happened to have like the letter that like they sent to panhouse and that they got rejected to the panhouse
4211.32,4213.32, We're on the couple words
4213.32,4218.5599999999995, No thanks dude and then it turned into the most creative flame wherever when like guys are like using the the the the
4218.5599999999995,4223.5199999999995, Fanfiction forum is a way to like insult each other. Yeah. That never happens on the internet. I know
4224.4800000000005,4227.4800000000005," Okay, so just let me see a choice bit from a cheat zero"
4228.400000000001,4233.080000000001, Basically he was kind of like recreating a life of a guy who works inside one of the factories that build scorpions and shit
4233.080000000001,4235.68, Very creative which I thought was actually a pretty good go
4236.240000000001,4242.4800000000005," Yeah, let me see he will he's in there. He'll work sharply with your life for came as he takes a moment to realize"
4242.4800000000005,4247.0, It's his alarm clock looks over his floppy wife who still asleep spooning her cat instead of him
4247.120000000001,4251.400000000001, He ponders the the status of his relationship and the thought of the direction of the marriage of her
4251.4,4255.36, I was saying at least he shrugs it off of the huge cup of travel cup of coffee and sets off on his commute
4255.759999999999,4258.639999999999, He walks into the office in the factory hangs his coat looks at his inbox
4259.0,4261.32, It's almost to the ceiling of scorpions and requests
4261.5199999999995,4264.839999999999, There there are some days when he just wants to walk outside and the screen with the guy in the sky
4264.839999999999,4269.4, Why can't you make anything else you fucking noob this guy like you need a novel
4269.4,4272.36, He's definitely gonna be a winner cuz like this guy. I
4273.2,4278.5199999999995," Think he would like let me just say I think he would he'd enjoy the novel. Yeah, yeah, it's kind of an eye for detail"
4278.52,4282.900000000001," I liked that last line there. He was like talking to you the gamer. Yeah, very clever"
4282.900000000001,4284.1, Very meta very good
4284.1,4291.4400000000005," So I kind of like kind of like that. Okay, so all right, you know what that that's actually that's a series of like like Luke Smith's hot sis or you win"
4291.4400000000005,4294.820000000001, I think the other points for that's too and again cheap zero
4294.820000000001,4300.0," He wins yeah, that seemed like that was actually legit idea on that one so okay. We have two winners"
4300.0,4303.160000000001," Yeah, two winners graduations to both of you you both get books"

4328.52,4332.26, Maybe we should then and I thought it's because you're like you're drawing the cord around your neck right now
