0.0,3.96, This is the one up radio network and now GFW radio
4.46,11.64," Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast. This is the podcast for March 15th, 2007"
12.040000000000001,14.280000000000001," Right, I thought you're gonna be like"
15.6,17.6, Something now
17.6,19.6," No, this is all you get"
20.6,24.560000000000002, So as you can tell our regular host chef green is not here today
24.56,30.04, He is out with yet another debilitating illness which I think is the third or fourth
30.04,33.32," Well, okay, so so there we see there is the pneumonia"
33.839999999999996,39.58," Then he had well, there was the car problem. He was like trapped in the account is one of the problems he was out of the office for"
39.58,43.54," Come on, it's buried in ice for two or whatever. Yeah, yeah, I mean, that was ridiculous"
43.72,45.72, Then he had the
46.519999999999996,50.92," Yeah, the infamous pass out incident. Yeah, and now this and that was a brace series"
50.92,56.28, I thought badness happens in three's or is well for us now. I guess and I maybe there's two more coming because
57.28,61.56," Don't even say it man don't even say it. So yeah, we also have no Sean Elliott today"
61.56,67.56, He was also under the weather. That's what our Michael wins low of GFW no sound effects triphaline
71.56,73.56, I'll do a nerd voice
73.56,76.36, You know we could all do nerd voices although my school doing one right now
78.64,80.64, Yeah
80.92,87.64," Maybe it was that movie we saw yesterday. Yes, I feel too manly after seeing 300 yeah, we also 300 as a group"
88.44,91.2," After a big old deadline, which is why we're late by the way"
91.52,94.44, Because of our stupid magazine see if we didn't have a magazine
94.44,99.52000000000001," You would have a podcast every week right on time, but no, no, but no, you need to actually write stuff which is kind of messed up"
100.12,106.48," So so so we should just like jump right into it. Are we gonna identify ourselves? Oh, yeah, we should have some sort of ID not Jeff here"
106.48,108.48, This is like what do we do? Oh my god
108.88000000000001,114.80000000000001, So I'm daring gladstone. I'm Sean Moli and as previously
118.52000000000001,120.96000000000001," Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a really a polished podcast"
123.24000000000001,126.48," So we're talking about we had a whole list of things. I mean, I guess that just"
127.32000000000001,130.6, She's been since we were just mentioned the fact that we had saw 300
131.24,133.24, Not gonna talk about the movie so much as
133.68,138.04000000000002, They reviews that have been going up and like if you look at rotten tomatoes and you know
138.04,143.44, We're talking movie critics here have all been kind of comparing it to a video game in a negative light anytime
143.44,146.72," There's it seems there's a lot of reviews that say, you know, oh, this isn't very good"
146.72,151.92, It's just like watching a video game. It's something we've heard a lot in you know other movies
151.92,157.92," Sit for other movies not just 300, but finally someone in variety a big pretty big movie trade publication"
158.35999999999999,162.12, decided to write an editorial that just had stop it. So I'm gonna read a small
163.23999999999998,165.23999999999998, segment of it
166.12,168.44," Okay, this is by Ben Fritz at the variety"
168.72,174.08," What's his name again Ben Fritz Ben Fritz, right? Okay, so reviews for 300 were across the board"
174.08,178.52, But those who dislike to share the division that reveals at least as much about today's film critics as it does
178.52,180.52, It their thoughts on the movie
180.52,186.24," And quote once the newness of 300's look wears off, which inevitably does we are left with all"
186.24,193.64000000000001, We're left with a video game come to life wrote to can the terrain of in the lost Angela's times 300 will be talked about as a technical achievement
193.64,198.6, Next clip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games added slates of Danish demons
198.6,201.44, And then later he's like those were all negative reviews of course
201.79999999999998,208.51999999999998, Our stays movie critics video games are the new MTV music video a short hand insult for any movie deemed to have an effects and visual
208.51999999999998,211.51999999999998, Planech at the expensive plot and go here it's and
213.07999999999998,215.07999999999998, Then you pretty much go on to say all right
215.72,219.76, You guys got to stop doing this because you're clearly revealing yourself to be
219.76,228.12, Just have no your fingers not on the pulse of of media in general if you think all video games are like this and
229.64,232.6," He's got a point. Yeah, you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it out there"
233.28,239.56, And you could go in man that you totally hit the nail in the head because I mean there are so many games that have like better storylines than some movies
239.56,241.76," I've seen I mean, I want to just compare to a crappy you know"
242.2,245.12, How many video games to see get compared to crappy some of our blockbusters?
245.12,250.48000000000002," Yeah, yeah, well, he says later in the article stereotyping games as based on brainless violence subset"
251.04,254.24, Is as fair as dismissing the art of movie making based on wild hogs
256.16,259.44, Which made a whole lot of money that first week it was out by the way are you kidding me?
259.44,263.6," It's like almost 40 million dear God. Oh, yeah, I weep for this nation"
263.6,268.72, So there's any actually compared it to a comic book. I know that's the weird thing is like
269.32,272.16, How many people are comparing it to the comic book? It was based on
273.12,280.48," Which which identity yeah, it's just it's a strange thing where movie the word video game is definitely tossed around as"
280.92,283.64000000000004, Short hand for it's kind of sucks and has no soul and
284.16,287.92, I don't know I maybe I've been guilty of this too. Maybe I have like said yeah
287.92,292.40000000000003," That was kind of like watching a video game, but I don't know but the thing is I think it's like I mean"
292.40000000000003,298.08000000000004," Yeah, in some weird way, maybe it's a little like dynasty warriors or something, but I mean I know I know that's a bad compared"
298.08000000000004,300.92, It's a bad comparison. I know I do not want to see the movie
300.92,307.48," Yeah, and yeah, well that that's kind of is kind of like just hacking slash with my video game it could be there you go"
307.48,309.48, But I guess what I'm getting at is
312.36,315.88, What I'm getting at is I mean like why don't they try comparing 300 to
316.52000000000004,318.52000000000004, Night's of the old Republic Jdm Pire
318.92,322.36, Some you know I think that's the point is the people who are saying video game have no
324.36,328.6, I want to sit those critics in front of those games and then that's not gonna happen
328.6,332.44," I mean, it's not gonna happen, but it's just kind of like that's just saying these people are"
333.16,339.32000000000005, Using a short hand they shouldn't because they're completely clueless and it makes the reviewers look like they're totally out of touch
339.32000000000005,342.20000000000005," Yep, it makes them feel less credible. I mean"
343.0,346.6, It's more on them than on us. I know it's just it just gets frustrating because
347.48,353.88, Because they're like the LA times or something a lot a different subset of people listen to them as opposed to people who would pick up a magazine or
353.88,357.56, Listen to a podcast because you know my grant you know my father
357.56,360.12, He's not gonna be he picks up the magazine so I'm in it
360.44,362.8, But he's gonna pick up a local paper great
363.32,370.2," That's all I'm saying yeah, but do again more to video games than just the stabbing things with spheres games as well"
370.2,372.2, No
373.56,375.56, What the fuck
377.24,380.6, I'm gonna is holding up a piece of paper that says wait
381.16,383.68, Do we have something okay? Hey everyone
384.68,386.68, He's feeling okay
387.24,389.24, Miracle
389.24,393.96000000000004," Oh, then he's gonna put it he's actually a throw up on the mic. Sorry about that weird interference here"
394.6,396.6, Who's got a head set for?
397.72,400.92," Hey, you can borrow mine. We only got three all right, so"
401.96000000000004,403.96000000000004, So this is what is this the
405.0,407.0," All right, okay, all right, okay"
407.0,409.0, Hero
409.0,413.48, I had I just found this one I had to bring it by heroes of the web
414.2,416.2, PS2 forcer 31
417.4,419.4," God, I'm ready for this"
419.4,421.56," Okay, it's coming in here on a dry run"
422.68,424.68, Okay

432.59999999999997,437.64, To leave us in the dark then they wonder why they company is going down the shitter
438.76,445.79999999999995, All as I got to say level five slash square in X they miss need to hand their company over to the RPG
445.79999999999995,451.79999999999995, Pro S P Apple that they have been doing our P genes for the last 20 something years full of love of

457.23999999999995,459.88, To which this generated the response
459.96,463.64," Actually, you know before the one that I know you're sorry. So this is going okay"
463.64,465.4," I'll wait. Oh, it's the same dude. He's coming back"

529.0,535.5600000000001," Good that was the real deal you know actually the one thing I know you know I feel well, but I was kind of wishing you do with the Canadian nerd accent"
539.8,541.8, I feel better man
541.8,543.8," All right, so yeah, he's clearly very sick"
544.04,548.8399999999999, So sick you know what but that thing is that that little fire under his ass this morning like I remember he showed me that like originally
548.8399999999999,550.8399999999999, And I'm like dude you got to read that on air
550.8399999999999,553.7199999999999," I'm glad he came around and he's probably out the door as we speak, but"
555.7199999999999,558.04," Feel better shot feel better, but we need to hear us that the web"
559.0799999999999,562.68, When we're talking about we were just wrapping up the 300 docks so yeah
563.4,568.52," We'll be critics dumb videos video games cool. Yeah, we had a sum up the topic. Okay, yeah"
569.0,572.92, So we had a couple other things when I had to cover that was there. I just wanted to hit the
574.04,578.4399999999999," You you were rather show this time what time run in the show? Oh, yeah, we should pick some in the run the show"
579.0,584.4, Like talk a bit about things we saw at GDC if you all know the game developers conference
584.4,587.64," Well, it was last week we talked a little bit about it right before we went and"
588.6,594.16," To me it seems like almost like I'm on the go, but I don't know if it's it's because I know I don't know if it's just like"
594.76,596.12, Deadline really got to me
596.12,601.32," We're in there a couple of mows and groans on the web on the boards about how like oh, they're just gonna complain about how boring it was"
601.64,604.6," Well, as someone said how much you want about that"
605.32,609.68, After complaining about how boring GDC is before they go that they'll come back and talk the whole podcast to it
609.96,611.64, But I don't think we will no
611.64,616.6, But actually there was one boring part of the podcast one one boring part of the of the show
616.6,618.6, I got a I guess get a shit this quick story so I
619.16,622.44, Was it was garnet myself we were all psyched you go check out there's this one up
623.4000000000001,625.0, A panel on
625.0,629.8000000000001, Alan Wake talking about its development has been put together and we both walk in really kind of cool
629.8000000000001,633.4000000000001, Because there was something about crisis happening at the same time
633.4000000000001,637.4000000000001, So we had a basically like you know the Sophie's choice twice learn more about crisis or Alan Wake
637.8000000000001,641.4000000000001, So he sit on the Alan Wake thing and we're kind of like waiting for it like kick in and
643.08,647.8000000000001, The whole thing was talking about not like what's going into the into the minute parts to it's going into the process
647.8000000000001,652.36, But it was very much like it was a project management like how they broke up the project management of putting
652.44,656.2800000000001," Together Alan Wake and how they work with a small company, you know a very small team of people"
656.5200000000001,662.1600000000001, Wasn't a garnet compared it when he was explaining it to me and he was equally like why did we go to the
662.1600000000001,666.0," Yeah, no, it was like basically pretty much said this is like the first business"
666.0,668.96," Of course you'd have it a community college kind of yeah, that's basically what it was"
669.96,674.0, When they when he got to the point they threw up a gant chart on screen on like okay
674.0,679.84," I think I'm about ready to leave wasn't it it was just like hey, why don't you consider outsourcing"
680.36,684.52, Wow kind of like something you might see it a game to fell
684.52,688.0400000000001," Yeah, exactly that brings up the point like a lot of these panels"
688.6,692.24," Not for us well there were a couple panels that were for us, but like I said I"
692.24,696.72, I did the Russian roulette and said in a one that really wasn't for us right
697.24,700.12," But on that note, I think you said I'm a pretty cool one right?"
700.12,705.76, The only good one I didn't see many just because you know I didn't go to a whole lot of it because I don't feel a
706.04,710.48," A lot of the stuff is right up my alley, but the only one that I thought was interesting was called"
711.36,715.12, PC games in the age of connected consoles. I think that's what was called
715.6,717.6," It was often time yeah, it really does"
718.84,720.84, It was basically a okay
722.04,727.86," It's kind of a do me gloomy little kind of tone to it, but it was you know we always hear PC gaming deathnell"
728.3199999999999,730.2," Well, what was on the panel like what was it?"
730.2,735.24," Oh, you had Richard Hillman from EA his a producer has done like said over a hundred titles for them"
736.72,741.0," EA's Mike caps president over there. Oh, I mean X epic. Sorry"
742.4,745.4, Sorry and Johnson from for access yep and
746.48,749.12, Someone from obsidian whose name I have forgotten
750.52,752.52, Fierce no wasn't furgas
753.16,755.16, Should have printed Chris
755.16,757.64," Chris maybe in the Chris okay, I can't anyway"
758.3199999999999,761.84, The point of the panel was to discuss you know get people up there saying okay
762.24,765.8000000000001, We've got Xbox live we've got you know PS3 is no
766.4,767.4, You know
767.4,770.12, theoretically as online as
770.64,772.64, consoles can get
772.64,774.24, theoretically and
774.24,780.6800000000001, What places the PC have in this universe now because you know PC's biggest strength is on been you know online
780.96,782.96, So the panel pretty much
782.96,786.24, Decided or concluded everyone was on the same page about like
786.8,793.84, Really the future of PC gaming isn't gonna be your crisis is not gonna be your gear's a board-handed games those are
794.88,801.4, My caps pretty much said like we don't make a cent on the PC version of these anymore. We make all our money on consoles
801.84,807.8, It's the height the user the the entry barriers too high for users like you know the high-end video cards
807.8,811.24, And most of the people doing it or
812.16,813.52, Pirating it anyway
813.6,819.4, So that's pretty much like they're saying consoles are just it. Sorry. That was one of the scary little things
819.4,820.6," All right, so"
820.6,829.88, Let me see I mean and I know this this piracy thing has been like every computer platform in the universe has been like piracy was blamed for the death of everyone
829.88,832.38, But it's not like it's any better for consoles
832.84,837.6," Well, it is a little better. It is a little bit. I mean it's a little more difficult, but it not exactly"
837.6,842.4, I mean it's really easy to pirate PC games comparatively. I mean
842.88,846.72, It is I mean like it's not built into every PC that you can't
847.1999999999999,854.36, Hack or you can't like pirate right I mean you I mean the strength of PC being that you can get online and get pretty much anywhere in the universe really fast
854.56,859.68, Makes it so that you know you can get this all the illegal material really fast to
860.16,863.9599999999999," So that's you know a strength and a weakness, but that was something they were discussing"
863.9599999999999,865.9599999999999, I'm just kind of parading with the panel saying right now
865.96,872.44," Hmm, and then it makes me resume so they were saying like the games that are going to be successful on PCs are the persistent world ones"
872.44,879.5600000000001, Where the piracy is impossible so you got your world's warcraft your MMOs even like a battlefield 2142 I guess EA
881.32,884.0400000000001, Consider that an MMO because of the persistent stuff
885.1600000000001,888.9200000000001, You know if you ask me I think a big part of it is I mean you're right
888.9200000000001,892.62, I think the barrier to entry for playmas high end the crisis and you know every game
892.7,895.5, I think that's you need to have a couple thousand dollars you disposal
895.82,901.38, But I and I think that you know obviously for a lot significantly less you can get a decent experience on a console
901.38,904.38," It's gonna be I wouldn't say comparable, but you know it'll be there and"
905.34,907.58, What's stopping people from like just you know I
908.3,910.3, Hopefully game studio express and
910.86,916.88, Basically seeing more indie games and more like smaller efforts that you couldn't see come out on a console right
916.88,920.52, That was one of the things that was another one of the areas that these panelists were kind of like
921.0,925.0, Here's one of the areas that's gonna be popular and the niches that PCs is gonna
925.56,929.0799999999999, Evolve into it's more about evolution of the PC in two for consistency
929.56,935.76, Little indie games and the fun the funny thing is that's more that's exactly where PC gaming started right back
935.76,937.76, It started with the circle. Oh
937.76,941.0, The lights went out. I said now and now the bootlighting in the room anyway
941.0,944.72, But this is a bit of the point is like we've always been like this. I mean like our our
945.28,947.84, It's always only with the advent of 3D cards and
947.84,954.5400000000001, You know like FMV games like the games started getting bigger and beefier and doing a lot more and demanding a lot more hardware
955.2800000000001,959.48, Right another saying and another saying maybe now that the
959.48,965.8000000000001, The consoles are doing a lot of what PCs could only do that it's gonna swing back for its consoles for certain types of games
965.8000000000001,970.88, So right and I'm gonna be totally honest with you like this is this is like for a long time now ever since you know
971.2800000000001,975.4000000000001, Free loader surface to the magazine and we started you know running these 101 free games features annually
976.36,982.78, I've been a lot more fascinated by like the indie gaming efforts. I mean I I regularly hit the game dev boards and I'm looking for like
983.5799999999999,985.84, Like talented students and guys
985.84,989.92, You just want to make a game out of their basement because that that's where they're really creative stuff's coming out of and
991.48,996.48," Actually I could I could totally derail this conversation into a whole their territory, but I'll hold out for a second"
996.48,1000.0799999999999, Did you want to keep going with my with PC doing more?
1000.8000000000001,1005.5600000000001, More are PC doing not I'm just hey I'm just saying what the panel said. I mean they were very clearly like
1006.08,1010.2, Very skeptical about the PCs future and this is like you know pretty big developers talking there
1010.2,1013.6800000000001, And that and that's exactly yeah these are big developers were skeptical about the future because
1014.12,1019.44, They want to make these big huge mega title games a cost millions of dollars and again. Yeah again
1019.44,1024.92, Maybe I'm you know mistating when I say skeptical about the future there's skeptical about the future as it's
1025.88,1029.7, Skeptical about it existing as it does today because they are saying
1030.2,1034.48, persistent worlds the book I from EA was all over all over
1035.0,1040.4," Well obviously is all over the Sims, but he was kind of saying the big reason the Sims is so popular is because"
1040.64,1046.28, You have this unfettered access or the people playing the Sims have this unfettered access to all of these
1047.48,1049.64, community things that they can do and there's no
1050.8400000000001,1053.1200000000001, like Microsoft or Sony
1054.08,1058.76, Barriers to it so if you want to get like you know your Sims porn mods or whatever
1058.76,1060.4799999999998, It's totally there and that's something that
1061.1999999999998,1063.1999999999998, Xbox Live for example you're never gonna get
1063.4799999999998,1069.3999999999999, Stuff that isn't sanctioned to be on Xbox Live arcade so that's kind of a you know the open network thing is huge
1069.6,1073.1999999999998, There's skeptical about like open network to the PS3 could ultimately be
1075.0,1078.0," You guys got to be some policing at some level for sure. Yeah, exactly"
1078.8,1081.2," And you know, yeah, it has an interesting place right now too"
1081.2,1084.0, I mean they they were there were some early pioneers in online gaming and
1084.64,1087.12, You know they had they've had some mixed results over the years right?
1087.84,1091.92," Yeah, I mean I personally I wonder what would happen if majestic came out today"
1093.84,1095.2, Didn't you
1095.2,1099.92," Someone reviewed something that was pretty much like majestic. Oh, well missing yeah, I mean like how was that?"
1099.92,1104.46, Well the first game the first game was great. I mean we gave it adventure game of the year the first one
1104.54,1109.22," Okay, the sequel was kind of a mess, but that's a whole story, but I'm just saying is like they were trying"
1109.22,1111.66, They've tried all these different things a motor city online
1112.38,1119.18, Obviously you will right and now and now actually now they're the quiet and be an elf earth and beyond
1120.38,1123.42," Everquest in space, but"
1125.98,1127.18, That was kind of fun
1127.18,1132.78," But anyway, but but now they acquire like mythic games. There's some cool, you know there is some possibilities like they definitely are"
1133.1,1136.3, At least it looks like the one of it invest further in like the future of online gaming
1137.5,1140.94, So there's take one piece he's in that respect have you have you seen a warhammer?
1141.82,1143.82, I saw at E3 haven't seen it since then
1144.94,1152.7, I mean more the the on the bottom of game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think looks pretty cool. I mean that that game suffers from the like
1152.7,1158.1399999999999, I said unfortunately which came first warcraft or warhammer because it looked at it and I was like
1158.46,1162.3," Okay, this is going to be competing directly against warcraft"
1162.78,1164.78," World of Warcraft is no well, yeah, but"
1165.5,1170.54, Like and if you look back like warcraft kind of ripped them off and look oh totally yeah
1170.54,1175.8999999999999," And their style. I mean you could argue that I'm not saying they did. Oh no, but actually it's pretty much like if you just look down to timeline"
1175.8999999999999,1178.1399999999999," Yeah, but then you could also argue that like"
1179.82,1183.18, Fantasy itself was ripped off from Tolkien which was something else
1183.42,1190.06, Who knows who ripped off who can more but more be guests than the Bible point is they're throwing this out there when world of warcraft is gonna be still
1190.46,1192.94, Huge and it's gonna be dangerous for them
1193.26,1195.26, But they do have different kind of for anybody
1195.26,1200.94, But you know I think that anybody who's played like any of the any of the like the warhammer the four-year K games or the THQR Tuses
1201.26,1204.3, That people look like people will actually understand that universe that style
1204.3,1210.22," No, it's interesting say 40 K because there's another MMO they announced that GDC that's right based on 40 K"
1210.22,1215.5, Which I would be way more interested in than non-for totally totally what I mean I don't know how long
1215.82,1219.46," Well, way that is that's gotta be years well I say which whichever one comes first war"
1220.14,1223.86, Warhammer or 40 K online or world of world of starcraft either
1224.06,1228.78, Which everyone comes out first I'm investing is I need a good sci-fi. I'm seriously that's what I'm waiting for well
1228.78,1232.54, There's this this one that CCP does called the evil online
1234.94,1238.26," I don't know it's all spaceships, all right. They want non spaceships too"
1238.7,1241.26," Okay, you want to sci-fi animal without spaceships"
1241.26,1245.34," Well, yeah, like it's possible Star Wars could have been like tabular rasa looks like it could be"
1246.3,1251.98, The sci-fi MMO that maybe I would have had both I can't just want to fly a ship
1251.98,1256.54," And did you guys actually get to see that during the show? Yeah, yeah, how did you think of it?"
1257.18,1259.5, It looked cool like they were kind of
1260.3799999999999,1262.3799999999999, talking up all these points
1262.3799999999999,1263.74, that
1263.74,1267.1," I thought were were big deals, but it's like well, we've kind of seen this before"
1267.34,1269.6599999999999, We have you know Richard Gary it he was he was
1270.2199999999998,1271.98, Present in the game and
1271.98,1278.9399999999998, That he was talking up all this like instance content like nobody had ever seen instance content before and how like this was their original idea or something
1278.9399999999998,1281.1799999999998," You know, it's kind of funny like so many people like it's"
1281.8999999999999,1288.1399999999999," Yeah, it's total spin-doctor mode like I dealt with that a couple times during the last week too. I mean, how I was talking"
1288.6999999999998,1291.8999999999999," I mean, I could so go in like five different directions with this conversation, but"
1293.5,1295.34," Okay, I'm big one. I'm gonna go with live anywhere"
1295.4199999999998,1299.98," Okay, well, yeah the live on this on PC now that opens up a whole live"
1299.98,1304.86," All right, that's a whole other can of worms that I don't know me like a lot of people are hating on that"
1304.86,1306.86, And I'm kind of halfway there on it as well
1307.5,1312.06, So the idea is like if you if you already are basically if you already are a live member
1312.54,1315.26, If you pay for Xbox you know Xbox Live service 50 bucks a year
1315.82,1321.5, Then you it extends to the PC and you have all the all the same stuff you expect from the console experience
1321.82,1326.06," Want a PC as well plus interconnected, you know console PC gameplay. Wow"
1327.02,1328.86, For those who haven't done the
1329.58,1334.14, Who are strictly PC and haven't signed up for live? It's a really hard sell so basically
1334.46,1338.86, There's the silver and gold package the silver packages what everyone gets no matter what that's free
1338.86,1341.82, That's totally free. That's free on Xbox Live. You're right
1342.38,1344.14, So basically you you can
1345.02,1349.74," Text chat meet up with buddies synchronize combat, you know synchronize you know actions whatever"
1351.9,1354.3, You can I believe from what I've been told
1355.26,1357.66, Set-up servers so you can host servers and play against other people
1359.66,1365.42," And you can it get a cheap and points that that in single-player and single-player modes of games, but it won't carry over an multiplayer"
1366.06,1368.06," Okay, okay"
1368.06,1370.06, Here's okay
1370.06,1375.66, Game that's gonna come out with that's gonna support the game's for windows thing is gonna have this built into it basically
1377.18,1379.9, You know going down the road. I'll hello is the first one
1380.8600000000001,1382.8600000000001, Beyond that is you know shadow run and stuff like that
1384.14,1390.46, The part that I thought was pretty stupid is you have to basically like the one thing that you kind of expect the most out of it voice
1390.94,1392.94, That's part of the gold package
1393.18,1397.66," Okay, so basically you could text people but you can't talk to them and then if you want to talk to them"
1398.14,1401.3400000000001, And you don't want to pay it and it's okay. I'm going back to using venture lower team
1401.3400000000001,1404.38, Speak to any other billions of programs. I already use right so
1404.94,1408.5400000000002, Is it really making life easier or is it just further complicating matters?
1409.18,1413.02, I think the argument is that they're trying to apply console logic to the PC
1415.58,1418.78, And I think part of the problem is like the part of the what sold it my first place for consoles
1418.78,1421.74, You had all these extra things plus you could download extra content and
1422.3799999999999,1427.82, You know all these these are all things that made sense for the content that's right and these are all things that you couldn't already do on a piece
1427.82,1432.7, So they're trying to like right so they're adding another layer to it right that's exactly it people are obviously
1432.7,1436.78, Resistance to and the one and I guess time this in with what Gary had said about how wow
1436.78,1439.02, Instancing for the first time. I was talking to them
1439.42,1443.8, Just yesterday or something and one and one guy who shot on a main nameless
1443.8,1446.06, Don't a I could always just we were just talking shit
1446.06,1450.98, He says yeah and finally you know in a game like shadow run
1451.5,1453.82, Console gamers and PC gamers can finally determine who's best
1454.3,1455.82," You know, I'm like"
1455.82,1458.06, Wouldn't they do that on the Dreamcast with Quake
1458.74,1460.74, Because that I had cross platform playing
1461.54,1467.14, Can they do that with me see one of the need for speed games let you have PC versus console racing
1467.78,1475.42, So it's always different like just can be conveniently forgetting things but the past I got I got an email from some random
1475.74,1478.34, There was some random press release the other day. It was like
1478.66,1484.42, What ever they were talking about it was like this is the first online world war two shooter ever
1486.1,1488.1, What
1488.8999999999999,1493.82, You know it and I don't even know it to say it and it's like even if they meant first you know in MMO
1494.6999999999998,1496.8999999999999, World War two shooter ever like that's still be real
1497.4199999999998,1499.4199999999998, Not right either yeah
1499.98,1503.6599999999999," You know, you know, we should just make a high for some show us them. Okay. I know it. I say like for next week"
1503.6599999999999,1507.6599999999999, We should just like have be like the higher pervally police and just like grab some like the best press release
1507.6599999999999,1511.98, We can find and just read it on air. Oh man. Have another segment add to the heroes of the web
1511.98,1513.98, The way I have a PR
1513.98,1514.98, P R
1514.98,1515.98, Email
1516.54,1521.08, Anytime we get an awesome email like that I'll print it up and like tape it up on your wall
1521.08,1523.78, My cube we have a lot of them just to start reading those
1524.18,1526.5, You do a whole podcast based on Brian's wall
1526.82,1530.8600000000001," We could have had a couple of years. Yeah, there's like a lot of a lot of quality hate mail up on that guy"
1532.46,1535.38," So yeah, I guess the big question for this is like"
1536.06,1541.66, What are we getting out of it right like that we do what I already have that goal to come back
1541.66,1546.7," TV well, that's actually the other thing that the gold package offers as far as I understand right now is like the"
1547.3400000000001,1552.94, Matchmaking stuff like a true skill. I think that's their TM for the matchmaking service
1553.5800000000002,1555.18, So basically
1555.18,1559.5800000000002, Cutting down on the clutter and they may and they'll have the servers on the back end and you know whatever
1559.5800000000002,1562.7, So no that would play shadow run against the next box
1563.02,1569.1000000000001," 360 point you need gold right exactly. Okay, the cross platform play only happens on gold so"
1570.06,1575.86, You have Halo 2 and Shadow Run. It's pretty much I think the lineup right now is me know it
1575.86,1582.3," That's pretty much it. Okay, you know what though like I mean PC gamers PC gamers who are competitive and play these games online"
1582.74,1587.1, Right there just gonna be like well the hell with this these console gamers are
1588.06,1589.74, aren't
1589.74,1592.54, As skilled I mean that's I'm assuming that well yeah
1592.54,1594.54, There's a whole
1594.62,1599.82, There's the coming grudge matches and see who really you know if I mean there's a couple layers of this I mean like there are one
1599.82,1604.26, I mean I have to have to be able to balance the game well so that I mean because oftentimes on
1605.58,1608.22, On console games they you know in especially in first-person shooters
1608.3,1609.34, They tweak the
1609.34,1615.02, The accuracy so that like the targets are a little sticky here as easier to hit something than it is with the keyboard mouse
1615.02,1619.54, Can say there are a bunch of PC players playing would you even want to play against these console players that?
1619.54,1623.74," Yeah, that's actually another valid point like if are they like are they cool to hang or they mature"
1623.82,1628.06," Just a bunch of like I mean I even know that like okay, so they're playing a different style of game"
1628.78,1634.54, Like because they're using a controller like do I do I really want to play match by skills against them because I know that
1634.7,1636.7, Not really an even playing field
1636.7,1643.66, It's tough to say if that's the problem. I think the better test would be one of the many issues here the first true test will be the shadow run
1643.98,1647.18, It's a very frenetic kind of it's more like a from what I played of it
1647.18,1651.42, It feels somewhere between counter strike and UT style kind of fast-paced
1651.5,1659.98," Can you play PC versus PC shadow run without a hold? Absolutely okay, so again why would you necessarily if there's enough players assuming there's enough players who have this game"
1660.54,1666.14, Why would you want to play against the console people what's different about that for a player that's that's the million dollar question
1666.14,1668.14, I won't know until
1668.14,1673.42, Until we don't actually get get some code of my hands right so what else does golf give you you know
1674.0600000000002,1676.0600000000002, I
1676.0600000000002,1682.78, Don't know there's not much point I mean like as far as I know right now like that's kind of the high level what to expect sort of thing
1682.78,1688.8600000000001, I'm not all the details are not all not all the details are out there and really like they just see this as a first step
1688.8600000000001,1692.22, And man they need to get that a second and third step pretty quick if you ask me
1692.22,1694.22, Sounds like as a first step it
1694.22,1699.1000000000001, I mean what what we know or what we think we know is not really all that interesting
1699.1,1701.1, We're feeling well
1701.1,1706.54, I mean it's like I said it's basically adding a whole their layer and still not offering everything that an X-fire can give you right now
1707.26,1711.74, So I mean like you know setting up play setting up matches in a game is great
1711.74,1717.98, But not being able to actually talk to somebody you know having to switch over to another program just to you know talk to him during the game
1718.4599999999998,1720.4599999999998, It's kind of stupid
1720.4599999999998,1727.4199999999998, I mean it's a tough for somebody basically like what would what I mean if I was Joe Microsoft I was over there working on this project
1728.0600000000002,1732.6200000000001, The one hurdle that I I would try to like overcome is providing that extra content
1733.26,1739.18, You know make make the make the voice free and like figuring out what what other extras can you give somebody to incentivize them to pay that money a month
1739.8200000000002,1742.38, All right as it stands like it's a yearly thing right right
1743.1000000000001,1749.98, The only thing that this makes sense for right now is someone who hasn't Xbox 360 has the gold service and
1750.38,1754.7, Also happens to play PC games. That's the only way this makes sense to me right now
1755.66,1759.26, I'm taking a wait and see a broach. There needs to be more coming out of it at this point
1759.9,1762.3, Right okay fair enough
1762.6200000000001,1764.6200000000001, Ryan have anything to add
1764.8600000000001,1766.38, No
1766.38,1770.78," All right, let's take a little break here and then we'll come back and we'll have even more"
1771.42,1772.6200000000001, Stuff to talk about
1772.6200000000001,1775.3400000000001, Strangely I thought this would be a really quick podcast and yes
1775.9,1779.5," Yeah, I figured with the three of us we'd have to just not in the say we're all really boring"
1779.58,1781.58, Thanks
1781.58,1786.14," I'm sure the listeners if you guys yeah, let's see the listeners of determine that already"
1786.14,1788.38," But yeah, let's hear you just hold damn podcast"
1788.38,1790.78, Let's see if they hang on until the end of the podcast
1791.5,1793.5," Okay, see you in a bit"
1798.94,1800.94," Oh hello, I didn't see there"
1800.94,1807.82," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live the weekly podcast from the editors of electronic gaming monthly along with the wonderful sounds of"
1810.3,1817.34, EGM live comes action pack with special guests late breaking news fanboy baiting commentary behind the scenes tales of office Tom Follary and

1829.34,1832.54, It is not actually live and contest prices are not guaranteed to be fan tabulous
1835.18,1837.18, And we're back
1837.18,1840.0600000000002, It was gonna do that could end the different design before break
1841.26,1847.1000000000001," Well, I had to take advantage of that actually I'm gonna jump on the mic really quick and kind of rip through a couple quick things from"
1847.1000000000001,1851.3400000000001, It just I spent my whole week at GDC and I'm not I don't want to waste the whole show talking about it
1851.5800000000002,1853.66, But there are some interesting things I want to just want to throw out there
1854.46,1857.5800000000002, So before the break we're talking a little bit about hello to Vista
1857.98,1862.3, We were we were funny how that happened so I am just wanted to bring this up really quick
1864.14,1865.3400000000001, Now
1865.3400000000001,1866.7," You've played it on the consoles, right?"
1867.42,1873.66," Okay, oh no, I shut up all right, so I mean I I've played it and I enjoyed it, but not as much as hello one so"
1874.14,1875.3400000000001," Okay, so I"
1875.3400000000001,1882.38, You might you can see you probably will feel what I'm coming from here so I'm playing the PC version keyboard and mouse and it felt
1883.42,1888.6200000000001, How it felt slow it felt kind of awkward and and clumsy I mean like I'm used to playing slow first person shooters
1888.6200000000001,1889.42, I could know a
1889.66,1896.14," Graw, you know is a very slow tactical fighter but it felt like you know there's no run mode there's no"
1897.5800000000002,1902.22," You you but I felt like you're moving slower okay, and I'm like is there a shift to hit the run key?"
1902.22,1904.22, Am I just doing something wrong?
1904.54,1907.3400000000001, And it wasn't like game performance it wasn't like the game was chugging
1907.8200000000002,1911.74," It was just it felt a little slower to me and I'm like okay, maybe it's all in my head maybe it's perception"
1912.54,1917.26," And then they plug in a game pad and I said okay, you know what this maybe sacrilegious, but I'm gonna play a"
1917.26,1921.66," PC first person shooter with a game pad and as I'm doing it, I'm noticing"
1922.94,1927.5, It's key to analog movement so like I'm moving the the left thumb stick up a little slightly and he's you know
1927.5,1930.46, Walking a few steps that I push it up all the way and he's running right
1930.94,1933.9, Doesn't matter that on the right with the keyboard right I was too
1935.18,1939.26," Seems like a minor thing, but I noticed because like I was getting I was getting my ass handed to me when I was playing"
1939.26,1942.94, You know with keyboard and mouse right and then as soon as I have the the game pad at my hand
1943.66,1946.78, I'm like guilt whipping grenades and back corners. I'm like
1947.42,1952.54, Own of the map and I'm just wondering is it me is it all in my head because I played the halo
1952.54,1955.18," It's because I played halo two on a game pad, but at the same point"
1955.66,1957.66, I play first person shooters all the time
1957.74,1964.06," Right, well, you're saying just what you just have a thing, you know analog movement thing is just like clearly this game was designed"
1964.94,1970.94, For a console from the beginning right now here it doesn't a PC which obviously has some different nuances to it right
1970.94,1974.14, I mean and that's not saying anything like the game looks look the game looks pretty good
1974.7,1977.22, I mean it doesn't look like you know held gate or
1977.66,1981.66," Crisis good, but it looks certainly better than the hit than the 360 upgrades"
1982.22,1984.8600000000001, You know the minor like you texture tweaks there were
1987.26,1992.7800000000002, I don't know it's just if you're looking for a game to showcase like what this to can do
1993.66,1995.66, I would have done a little bit more
1995.66,1999.66, Still a fun going to be a still a fun game and for those who haven't played but halo to yet
1999.98,2001.98, Maybe they'll get it get something yeah
2002.14,2008.94, Who who out there is interested this has been my question the whole all along is like who out there is still interested in Halo 2 that hasn't already played it
2008.94,2010.94, It's been sitting there gone
2010.94,2011.74, Man
2011.74,2016.6200000000001, You know what I like to play and I haven't yet halo two and I don't have a next box and I'm gonna get a PC. I don't know one
2016.6200000000001,2022.14," Yeah, I think if anyone the only thing the only thing that's supposed to be promising about this is that it comes with a"
2022.7,2024.7, Level editor it's supposed to be a now
2025.26,2028.3, Here's what I got I'm it's kind of a mixed thing. I talked to one person
2028.78,2030.3, You know officially on the record
2030.46,2033.98, Who is saying how it's gonna you know you need to know a little bit of coding to get this thing done
2033.98,2038.62, It's not that's not like cakewalk and then I talked to somebody who actually worked on the the tool set
2039.18,2040.78, And they said that it's actually pretty easy
2040.78,2044.22, Certainly easier than it was to make halo one maps. Mm-hmm. So I
2045.1,2050.7, Don't know I don't know who's what what the story is but that's the that's the big selling point so multiplayer
2051.2599999999998,2053.2599999999998, achievement points Yahoo
2053.5,2055.5, Woohoo and then
2056.94,2060.22, And then there you have it and then like you know about time when halo two
2060.38,2061.6600000000003, Comes out like
2061.6600000000003,2066.86," Gonna be almost time for halo three on the content. No, that's the sad thing. It feels so much like it just make"
2066.86,2072.1400000000003," Kaila underneath for the PC or why did they make hello wars for the PC you make an arts yes, but that's an old that's an old question"
2072.6200000000003,2074.6200000000003," Yeah, I mean"
2074.6200000000003,2076.6200000000003, It's frustrating yeah
2076.6200000000003,2078.94," All right, so they're getting yeah, we're getting the old game"
2079.34,2083.5, About the same time as the new game and it just makes you feel it makes feel a little
2084.46,2086.46," Yeah, just slightly"
2087.02,2089.82," All right, so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna cruise through this because there's"
2090.78,2095.42," I noticed that when I was walking around the show floor that yeah, there's a lot of nothing happening in some parts"
2095.42,2100.22, But there's also a lot of stuff that a lot of interesting these happening in the equivalents of kenshyo Hall from E3
2100.38,2105.9, There's like this a second hall that where I find some really interesting technology and some interesting like
2106.62,2110.94, Indie developers that are looking at like what I'll go into all that in a second so I'll just the hardware first
2111.58,2112.86, So
2112.86,2118.14," This is one wacky peripheral from I believe the companies called TN systems just I don't have double check that, but"
2118.46,2127.02, So imagine you wear a peripheral to vest and you strap it on and you're playing a for and they drop an API into first person shooters and like it pokes you
2127.02,2130.86, So like if you're getting if you're getting shot by a gun or something
2132.2200000000003,2134.46, A spacer a target appropriate
2135.26,2136.86, Piston or whatever
2136.86,2139.42, You know punches through the vest and it sounds
2140.94,2147.1," No, I hit by a rocket launcher. Well, I know the little thing is I don't want to get there's different intensity levels depending on distance and and weapon"
2147.26,2150.06," But the thing was like so okay, I might check this thing up all the way"
2150.06,2154.2200000000003," I want to see how tough this is gonna punch me. You know, it's just like it's like you're annoying little brother tapping you"
2154.6200000000003,2157.6600000000003, Who asked for this who is wanting to feel the bullets?
2158.3,2166.78, You know what I'm I'm I'm more of a carrot than a stick can I guys? So I'm like where's the positive reinforcement
2166.94,2173.1800000000003," Where's the the happy spot you know I'm like gonna go there, but I'm just like you can imagine what this best to be like"
2173.7400000000002,2175.7400000000002, I don't want to know
2177.82,2185.1800000000003," Yeah, that sounds yeah, that was kind of wacky and then this was the this was the year that like I felt like I walked on to the set of scanners"
2185.1800000000003,2188.2200000000003, There was like rain control shit there was some stupid stuff
2188.86,2192.2200000000003," People's had to explode and everything. Yeah, I'm waiting I was waiting for that"
2192.2200000000003,2196.46," So okay, so there's two two two companies almost right near each other showing off a"
2196.54,2201.34, Similar idea one was called neuro sky which is kind of like a low low budget
2202.14,2204.14, Thing that reads brainwave activities
2204.14,2207.18, Then what causes the machine human war in the year 20
2207.5,2213.02," Hi, but it does but actually there's another one, but I actually say hang tight. So okay, so so this one from neuro sky"
2214.2200000000003,2216.2200000000003," Yeah, I know well, yeah anyway"
2216.62,2218.38, From from cyber-dine systems
2218.78,2219.7400000000002," Anyway, so"
2219.7400000000002,2225.1, What happens is if it is a little meter like they had they created a half-life tomb on to show how it works right?
2225.3399999999997,2230.7799999999997, There's a little meter of the top of the screen and kind of said gives you a gauge for how much brainwave activities going on
2230.7799999999997,2232.7799999999997, Uh-huh and
2232.7799999999997,2235.58," If you're brain dead, sorry, you're not gonna be able to do anything, but if you"
2236.2999999999997,2240.06, Point the redical it an object in the game in the map and you focus
2240.46,2247.02, You can push the object and it works very it's a very binary honor off. There's no right levels of you know degrees of
2247.42,2248.7799999999997, sophistication
2248.7799999999997,2253.3399999999997, So did you try this I played it and it worked so you're pushing things with your mind
2253.34,2260.1400000000003," Yeah, so I mean, but I think it was like you pick the way they had a setup that was very basic. I know you hit like you"
2260.38,2262.38, You select like you know
2262.38,2263.98, I know I
2263.98,2267.6600000000003, I'm picturing you wearing some like my don't brown big
2268.94,2273.98," It's a big metal strainer with like no, actually it was just like imagine like the headsets were wearing the talk right now"
2274.06,2278.78," Yeah, they basically it was like wearing a headset like that. Okay, so okay, you point the mouse at whatever"
2278.78,2282.06, You point the you point the redical at a box at a box right okay
2282.06,2285.98, Or then you think like and you think I always thinking about celery and it moved
2286.38,2290.22, I was just like you don't have to like it's not a very sophisticated thing
2291.1,2295.74," I was like you know, so it sounds like you would have to actually expend effort to not think"
2296.2999999999997,2300.14, In order to not move it exactly so what's like the practical application
2301.42,2305.58, I know this one was gonna wear is is ever going to come in handy. Well
2306.7799999999997,2308.7799999999997, There there are PR pitchman
2309.34,2311.34, Johnny alluv
2311.34,2313.34, CW alum really really
2314.7000000000003,2316.7000000000003, So anyway
2316.7000000000003,2319.7400000000002," Yeah, anyway, so the hook is you can do all these cool things"
2320.86,2324.3," You know you can move objects in game, but the snare is that you can"
2325.82,2327.82, I should I put it
2328.46,2332.7000000000003, I don't know I mean like it's just so arbitrary and like there was one it was actually pretty funny
2332.94,2337.34, There was a guy who went after me at apparently he must have he must have been brain dead because he couldn't get anything to move
2338.3,2340.3," Anyway, but like um"
2340.3,2342.3, I don't know it just didn't feel like
2343.1000000000004,2345.1000000000004, So you're saying this
2345.1000000000004,2349.1000000000004," Contraption that we was thinking with your brain is stupid. Well, I wouldn't say it's stupid"
2349.1000000000004,2353.5, I said it's very simplistic. There was another thing there actually I'm going to their offices to check out tomorrow
2353.6600000000003,2355.6600000000003, It's a lot more sophisticated
2355.6600000000003,2358.38, So this is company called emotive systems and
2359.58,2361.1800000000003, Sir and Ed Freeze
2361.5,2364.3799999999997, One of the guys behind like you know wonder kind to work done like
2365.2599999999998,2367.5, But they have to know Microsoft for ages and
2368.7799999999997,2371.8199999999997, Help helped with IG and at the beginning he's working on this now and
2373.58,2377.5, So they so imagine like game it actually does a little bit more than just on our off
2378.06,2382.2999999999997, So I was watching this is it's actually requires hand movement so I'm going to try to describe this while I'm doing it
2382.2999999999997,2385.8199999999997, But so this guy it's a more expensive device you put a you know
2385.8199999999997,2389.02, It's it actually took a proper a skull cap on or like something
2389.98,2391.98, And
2391.98,2395.74, He was raising this guy demoing he would rate he was playing a Harry Potter game
2395.74,2396.94, You know like one of those
2396.94,2399.74, Rees one of the EA came out with lipid no. Yeah
2400.14,2402.38, So basically he raises his arms
2403.02,2405.5, He raises his arms and an object lifts up in the environment
2406.38,2411.42, And then he pushes his hands away like he's like shoving something and the object throws against a wall
2411.9,2414.94," Okay, and like that was it that was all the controls"
2415.9,2419.58, I mean like it was stuff that was doing I mean it seems like more sophisticated things you could do with it
2419.58,2423.98, I'm definitely curious to see what these are all tech demo we things exactly so tomorrow
2423.98,2428.86, I'm going to their office and see what the deal is up close on personal if it's total crap and a column on it
2428.86,2433.42, But it looked pretty it looked really interesting actually it was people like the entire there was
2433.7400000000002,2439.58, The entire of GDC was gathered around two areas. It was gathered around like this booth and the IGF guys
2440.2200000000003,2443.18, Now I've said before in the past I'm all about indie games and
2443.74,2448.3799999999997, I saw like all sorts of people just like running through there like all like epic guys might caps and cliffy be
2449.5,2452.94, Warned Spector all these guys like it's like everyone just kind of like wanted to see what then what these
2453.8999999999996,2456.94, Really creative students and just any developers wanted to put together and
2457.74,2461.4199999999996, You know what if you go to the IGF I think it's IGF.com
2461.8199999999997,2465.98, They have like all list of all the winners and links to the downloads and stuff like that's totally worth checking out
2466.22,2470.62, The IGF is independent game festival. It's a part of GDC. It's been around for a couple years
2471.58,2475.5, It's just like this is where like the the intro version guys got their break
2475.5,2480.14, This is where like all like the cool games that you that you don't hear about until a year later
2481.1,2483.1, This is where they start
2483.1,2484.38, So
2484.38,2485.42, Did you see anything
2485.42,2486.22, There yeah
2486.22,2491.42, Every day shooter one three awards and it's kind of like it's part every extend its parts
2492.62,2494.22, Robotron I guess
2494.22,2500.38, It's a simple shooter game but each level feels a little different and and there's the whole game is basically around
2500.62,2504.7799999999997, Center ground guitar riffs so as you're shooting him and shading explosions
2505.18,2507.18, You're creating music as you go basically
2507.9,2511.3399999999997," No, so I mean it's okay, it's actually pretty cool. It's a little bit of res a little bit of"
2511.9,2513.9, That can you download that right now
2513.9,2515.9," Um, or the louder it isn't"
2515.9,2519.02, It isn't fully done yet he pity was dem he was showing it off there
2520.46,2521.98, You don't do that guitar controller
2521.98,2524.94," No, no, there's no guitar all though like and that's another thing like there's like a"
2525.5,2530.46, The Giltole kid Giltole students and like other like rock RIT
2530.46,2537.42, Students were there showing off stuff one game actually did use a good it could use a guitar hero controller to play a game online
2537.7400000000002,2539.9, I mean a game the 2D
2541.1,2542.46, 2D it's like a
2542.46,2545.98, Besides scroller and you fight enemies by following guitar riffs
2547.58,2549.58, That's weird. I know I know but
2549.82,2553.9," All right, but there's someone like that's that's the point that there's so many creative games you don't see anywhere else"
2554.46,2558.62, There so that's I'm gonna cut off the gd the gdc rant right there
2559.1,2562.54," Okay, so the gc to you was a best that poke you"
2563.18,2568.22, Control and some indie games and some indie games. That's exactly it. All right. Good. Sorry. Cool. Done
2569.2599999999998,2571.8199999999997, So I'm like a some
2571.8199999999997,2574.46, Nubble read a little a little reader question
2575.2599999999998,2580.06, Okay from from the readers on the forums this is terror wrists 13. That's good name
2580.94,2583.1, It's well WRIST
2583.1,2588.2999999999997," Terror so his wrist is full of terror. Yes, but the current he writes with the current fan and game design"
2588.46,2589.6600000000003, A merchant gameplay
2589.6600000000003,2595.34, Being thrown around for games that have none like online shooters such as the next unreal game or simplistic console games like crackdown
2595.9,2602.2200000000003," All right, this is yeah, being able to figure out how to jump from one building to the next in ways that developers didn't imagine might be emergent on a first grid level"
2602.78,2604.78, Why isn't anyone talking about Eve online
2605.42,2609.02," Oh, and that it is an intense femur arpeggm"
2609.02,2610.0600000000004, M-o-r-p-g
2610.0600000000004,2615.5," Then not only gives elves swords and fireballs of the finger, but it also essentially is essentially player driven"
2616.46,2618.46, For example two fleets per carrying up to war
2619.1,2620.86, I don't know if I learned this whole thing
2620.86,2622.14, What do you write an essay?
2622.14,2623.66," No, as a little essay about this example"
2623.66,2626.22, I'm telling you people blowing each other up in a way
2626.22,2627.26, It's a better way
2627.26,2628.22, Never would have imagined
2628.22,2636.7, Eve online is the most superior online game ever played and then is this not rad why aren't people looking in this game more and taking note of what is accomplished and trying to
2636.7,2640.14, Incorporate into their own game to revolve the concept further clear that can be done
2640.14,2645.34, Are we gonna be stuck with the cookie cutter while experience for one ray of the same dungeon exactly the same as the other one?
2645.74,2651.58, And that no matter who you are to your five rating gear is gonna look exactly the same for one person to the next that's the question is
2652.94,2655.98," Hey, I talk about Eve online every year. Yeah, well number one"
2655.98,2664.86, We do you know Ryan is definitely not guilty of right always talks Eve online and the question of like what is emergent game play is kind of what came out of that for me anyway
2665.26,2666.94," Okay, yeah, I was gonna"
2667.26,2672.62, Well the question like are we going to be stuck with the cookie cutter while experience like the reality that all the
2673.18,2676.7, Publishing money has see yes that wow has eight million subscribers
2676.7799999999997,2678.46, So they want to be like wow
2678.46,2681.1, Eve has 160 thousand subscribers
2681.1,2682.54, They don't really look at that
2682.54,2688.04," Well, so you know like right now there are what 60 I'm there's something like 67 MMO games in development as we speak and"
2688.7799999999997,2694.64, How many of them are really gonna be a success like one right maybe and that one's called wow
2695.1,2698.22, Right so thank for me is like I am a huge ball fan
2698.22,2702.4599999999996, Anyone who listens to this and legendary thread knows says the man wearing a quest give her cap
2702.4599999999996,2704.4599999999996, I always give her cap
2705.02,2709.14, To me I've never stopped you on the street and like asked for a quest yes
2710.74,2715.58, Several times what do you say to him? I usually smile and nod sometimes
2716.22,2720.14, I just think of other than it depends I am usually make a value judgment based on a
2720.14,2724.2599999999998, Tell I'm that you should go back ten apples and then you should totally have a prepared quest man
2724.2599999999998,2727.18, You should be like a really shit you should be a low level new quest. Hi
2727.18,2732.46, I need five beers. It depends on my mood like if I'm just like sitting there on the bus reading and like the guy sitting next to me
2732.46,2735.46," Says something I'm like oh, I got to sit with a guy for another 20 minutes"
2736.14,2741.3399999999997, But if it's like someone walking by then it's cool. I have a day there's a we're in Target
2741.98,2748.46, And there was a family of six like more children mom and dad and dad says
2749.14,2753.8199999999997," Hey, what do I get if I turn into my quest and then I'm like haha"
2753.82,2755.82, I was fine
2755.82,2760.1800000000003, Look there's a dad who plays wow you should have like you should have like a camaraderie you should have a couple pennies in your pocket
2760.1800000000003,2764.1400000000003, And I said this before like I like it took me a little while to like
2765.02,2767.02, convince myself that wearing this hat was okay
2768.3,2773.32," In public because I'm like well, okay people who like I really into the giants always were where they're had"
2773.32,2776.44, I'm really into wow. I'm gonna wear this and it's gonna be okay. God damn it
2777.6600000000003,2781.6800000000003, It's I'm gonna help and help in the cause and making that all work acceptable in the matrix
2781.68,2785.3199999999997, The cause really needs a lot of it needs a little more help
2785.7599999999998,2792.08," All right, so back to the question was the sorry. Sorry. It took it off track. You're right as a wild player. So as a wild player"
2793.3199999999997,2797.52, This came to me like I played over quest. I played ultimately
2798.96,2804.8799999999997," Which oh the best game ever made me yeah, my best game ever made and to me those those were two"
2805.72,2809.16, Open ended I would sit there and I'd be like I can do anything
2809.16,2812.72, I don't want to you think ever quest was too open ended
2813.3599999999997,2816.48," Yeah, I the only thing there that you had to do it that was like"
2816.96,2820.0, When grind was the only thing to do to have a laugh right?
2820.0,2824.12," I didn't know why didn't even know what to grind necessarily I would stand there and go huh, okay"
2824.12,2826.12, This whole world is in front of me
2826.12,2828.12, And
2828.12,2832.3599999999997, That's pretty much the experience I had with ever with sorry with Star Wars galaxies when I first came out
2832.3599999999997,2837.72, Mm-hmm. I remember I I had all this awesome I spent all this time creating jubacca the kosher wookie and
2838.2799999999997,2841.8799999999997, I was I was more in rapture with their backstory with the game
2842.2,2844.48, But when I about how I landed on the planet. I'm like
2845.16,2851.3599999999997," Okay, there's a lot of people and where the hell do I go? What do I do and after about a day I was done with it?"
2851.7599999999998,2854.6," Yeah, there's a fine line"
2854.6,2858.52, But and you know this is actually an ongoing problem is like finally that fine line between the emerging gameplay
2859.12,2864.08, Where it's just kind of leaves you the open world to kind of toy with and then just kind of have a loose story thread to kind of
2864.6,2867.6, Not hold your hand at least kind of push you in a direction
2868.24,2871.72," Right, so yeah, I mean the problem with the emerging gameplay is like"
2872.2,2879.96," Sometimes it's nothing comes with it like okay, so I didn't realize the developer didn't intend me to be able to push this crate onto this guy and kill him"
2879.96,2881.48, But so
2881.48,2885.36, Like if you didn't you didn't intend for it so I didn't plan the result
2885.68,2891.34, So it's just like it's the sandbox mentality that I didn't I'm not all about the sandbox is what I'm trying to say
2891.68,2893.68, The Ryan's been playing
2893.7999999999997,2897.08, Ultima online well I've been playing ultimate online on
2898.08,2900.3199999999997, Hybrid which is a very popular free
2900.7599999999998,2902.7599999999998, Uo server
2902.7599999999998,2906.04, About a hundred and seven thousand players are aren't you worried talking about it?
2906.04,2907.3999999999996, Like you may shut that shut the
2907.72,2910.3599999999997, Sure down if they were gonna do that they would have done it already
2911.08,2913.6, Mark Mark Mark my words next week
2914.7999999999997,2921.3199999999997, You could think Ryan's got for your service. It's been around for about four years. I want to say and
2921.88,2923.88, And
2923.88,2928.3, About a hundred and seven thousand players that's quite a lot for a lot of money
2929.0,2931.0, 100 and I
2931.0,2934.0, I cannot for the life of me remember where I read this
2936.0800000000004,2940.7200000000003, Maybe I'm making it up. I don't know but I did a little over a hundred thousand players
2940.7200000000003,2944.4, So so basically I know they have the average about a thousand logins
2944.7200000000003,2949.44, It's crazy. We're seven wow and you know that that's kind of crazy. I mean like there's a game like okay another
2949.44,2951.84, Just another game that wasn't the same cookie cutter
2951.84,2956.2400000000002," I was you know, I'll else layer thing but auto assault. I mean how many people did that?"
2956.2400000000002,2960.04, I added some max and how many people were in that did it every top 100 thousand? Oh
2961.32,2963.48, Hell no no way
2963.48,2966.36, That was a put that was a post a post a pocket-laptic wasteland
2966.36,2968.88, That was just criminal like game was fun and no one played it
2968.88,2973.16," Well, I they had to condense it down to one server like less than one after a long exactly"
2974.0,2979.16, Right well the reason you're playing on this chart is because it's kind of an older version of the game
2979.44,2981.64, The reaction when it was more
2982.44,2989.06, Merchant I guess well back in about I think it was 2000 they released this expansion called Renaissance and
2990.12,2994.96, The big thing the Renaissance did was it introduced a mirrored version of the world
2996.0,2999.0, Where attacking players was not a lap and
3001.12,3007.7200000000003, That to me when I happened that that kind of like killed a lot of the fun of the game a lot of the fun in UO for me
3007.72,3011.3999999999996, I know you guys probably will argue this but a lot of the time for me was the risk
3011.9199999999996,3015.72, You know like you didn't know if the dude you just passed on the street was gonna
3016.24,3018.24, Trice kill you or not and
3018.64,3022.04, And when they introduced this this mirror server
3023.7999999999997,3028.54, It like you really had no reason to go back to the original
3030.16,3032.16, PvP
3032.16,3037.56, Everywhere world right I mean there was never any reason to go there if you didn't
3037.72,3039.04, You weren't into that
3039.04,3042.3599999999997, So that's kind of just like simply game on this downward spiral
3043.8799999999997,3047.3599999999997, And this server doesn't have that part of the game
3049.12,3054.3999999999996, But but they but they still continue to kind of like take and choose the best parts of the thing is the
3054.3999999999996,3056.64, EA introduces in the new expansion
3056.64,3059.72, So what so what does mirrored world what was it called?
3060.2799999999997,3067.68, Tramil that pretty much removed because you when are you like the kind of PB people are who like to kill people?
3067.72,3073.2, You're just wondering around are you a anchor no okay full shit no
3073.2,3081.2799999999997, I've never been that way now. All right. I'm more like the kind of person who likes to go and kill the people who do that
3081.8799999999997,3086.2," You know, so you like the Robinhood or what the avenger will sort of vigilante"
3086.52,3090.48, But there's no one to some of the food chain of that was removed when they made the mirror
3090.48,3093.68," So basically yeah, it's like you know all all worlds and no sheep"
3094.48,3099.2799999999997, So that's no fun no fun being a wolf when everybody else is a wolf
3100.7999999999997,3102.0, You know
3102.0,3106.44," Right like yeah, I would have moved to Tim let's go Tim real"
3107.24,3109.48, Tramil I would have moved to Tramil yeah
3110.44,3111.7999999999997, That was always I was
3111.7999999999997,3113.7999999999997," You know, yeah, pretty much"
3113.96,3119.72, My entire U.L. experience was mining gloves and then having someone killed my donkey and take all my gloves
3120.24,3127.3199999999997, Where like I can clearly remember the first time I would ever play your killed in U.O. and my response was just like wow
3127.3199999999997,3131.3199999999997," That was awesome. I had to learn how to do that. Yeah, my responses"
3132.24,3134.24, Schools out
3134.24,3139.0," Three o'clock time to shut off. Yeah, but then I've actually kind of been"
3140.24,3148.7599999999998, on an immo Odyssey lately. I spent a couple of these playing city heroes until I remembered once again
3148.76,3151.76, Why I stopped playing that game? Why's that?
3152.44,3156.5600000000004, It's boring after a while. I've never really got past level five
3156.5600000000004,3159.6400000000003," Like you know, hey, go into this building to go to you know"
3159.92,3163.48, Kill all these guys and accomplish the mission you wanted this building and it's like wow
3163.48,3167.1200000000003, I've been in this building 17 times already. It's the same building and
3168.36,3173.44, Then in city of heroes is kind of like it's the only immo I've ever seen were leveling up actually making worse
3175.28,3176.0800000000004, Really good
3176.08,3179.64," Like you have all these all these superpowers. Yes, you do and"
3180.48,3185.72, There are each super power has all these enhancements slots where you can have like a damage enhancer or you know an acc machine
3185.72,3187.72, Haneter doing that for instance
3188.12,3189.72, But the enhancers
3189.72,3193.98, Like let's say you know your level 15 and you add like a level 15 damage enhanceer to your
3194.56,3195.56, Your sort of tag
3195.56,3197.08, Mm-hmm. Okay cool
3197.08,3201.36, When you level up 16 17 that level 15 enhance or degrades as
3201.7200000000003,3208.06, You as the gap between your level and the enhancements level widens and eventually reach at the point where it's not doing anything for you
3208.32,3211.7200000000003," Yeah, but you're constantly in this race so like keep all your enhancements up to date"
3211.92,3214.48, But it's too goddamn expensive to buy new ones
3214.48,3218.08, So you're always like playing with all these outdated enhancements
3218.08,3219.48," Well, only if you play like a retard"
3219.48,3225.7200000000003, There's a you go out on the game world and they don't drop there and nearly as often as you when you get up to like level 18
3225.7200000000003,3228.96, 1920 they don't drop nearly as often as you need when you've got like
3229.92,3234.92, You can't you if you play I mean like I was I played up to about level 30 or 40 and
3235.82,3240.2400000000002," I didn't have a problem with it. I mean like yeah, I mean they're absolutely right that the degrading systems a little busted"
3240.2400000000002,3245.2400000000002, And the prices for upgrades at the stores or two from what I understand once you hit about level 30
3245.2400000000002,3250.4, You start earning more money than you can possibly spend but it's like getting after that point is like
3252.68,3255.68," Okay, all my attacks are now useless"
3255.68,3257.68, I
3257.68,3266.04, Didn't I didn't run into the wall that did because I actually I may maybe I was lucky maybe I may maybe my my luck my luck was up and like I just kept getting drops of the
3266.6,3271.64, Upgrades I needed I didn't have this I didn't have that problem. I had other inherent problems with how the game is designed like
3271.64,3276.72, I just I don't know I mean like with with the constant like issue updates and like adding new things
3276.72,3283.8399999999997, It fixed it and I just didn't like how you pick us there is no way to kind of undo a skill choice for a while until they
3283.84,3286.96, You you can but it's like you did jump through a bunch of hoops that do it right
3287.6800000000003,3293.4, So that's I mean I haven't gotten at that point yet and also the cost you know the costumes are a whole other thing and
3293.4,3295.4, I mean those are costumes are pretty cool
3295.4,3297.96," Well the costumes are pretty cool, but like the guy you create at level one"
3298.28,3303.56, That's what he's gonna look like and you add a couple little things along the way and you then you buy in the costume
3303.56,3308.28," I think okay, granted this is all changed since my initial impressions of my right ages ago and"
3308.28,3312.7200000000003, I think there's a lot a lot of my front my initial beefs have been you know polished over
3313.2799999999997,3318.3199999999997, Like you have that there's the character customization no one really totally nailed it because you got like
3318.9599999999996,3322.8599999999997, City of heroes where you can really customize something into something really cool
3323.5,3327.7999999999997," And that's great, but you can't change it the whole game. Well you can maybe I don't know"
3332.7999999999997,3339.1, How many times can you do that well you get you can you can I think you're like five slots you can have five completely different costumes
3339.1,3343.72," And there's like a tailor NPC that you can go to and see yeah, I'm played since it came out"
3343.72,3349.04," So that's it's like that sounds better. Yeah, but like then you have a game like wow"
3349.04,3357.9," We're okay, so you have a bunch of different slots in the beginning, but everyone winds up on the same because if we're not what's the legendary weapon right because there is pretty clear"
3357.9,3363.66, Distinct like gear that is the best if not like maybe two different
3363.66,3367.7999999999997, Beacuse I care that would be good so I don't know which is the best solution there
3369.18,3371.18, Really don't
3371.18,3375.7799999999997, Die is the best solution you can die everything that's a great solution. I'm all about that solution. All right
3375.7799999999997,3378.2599999999998, So let it off we answered that question. We don't really care
3378.7799999999997,3381.7799999999997," That's right. Screw you stop. Yeah, what's the story you terror risk?"
3382.7,3384.14, What's the what so you're right?
3384.14,3386.62, He's awesome and more people can be talking about it and
3387.5,3391.14, All those guys who want you to make wild clones are dumb because they're all gonna fail
3391.14,3394.02," Yeah, but you're on suddenly you know like"
3394.94,3401.58, They're not all gonna fail but like there's definitely something to the fact that 99% of them are 99% of them are and like anyone who try something
3401.58,3405.14," It's as sucks as it is so sucks as much as does to say this, but"
3406.2599999999998,3412.2599999999998, Anyone anyone who's been trying to do something different or beyond well still doesn't make that much money
3412.94,3415.5, Except for maybe guild wars because they don't charge any monthly fees
3415.5,3421.82, So maybe that's the trick is to make a game that doesn't require monthly fees to actually get some traction because
3422.54,3426.26, There's only so much money anyone has to spend on games per month and there's only so much time
3426.26,3430.26," Anyone has to dedicate the games per month. You have to basically make a game is better than wow, but not wow"
3430.26,3432.26," Right, so good luck"
3432.26,3434.82, Good luck on that the guilders doesn't have like

3440.14,3446.2999999999997," They don't but big but again, they kind of falls outside the equation because it doesn't charge monthly fees right. That's why they"
3446.74,3451.74, You know make you buy another game to get a new content. That's a different model right. I don't know
3452.7799999999997,3458.06," Not for that all right well, I guess we should wrap up no no any final thoughts Ryan"
3460.18,3461.7799999999997," All right, I just recommend to mine"
3461.7799999999997,3464.5, That's actually heard Ryan talk this episode

3499.56,3502.92," Breakout, I guess or bubble bubble or it's kind of a camera"
3502.92,3507.32," We're gonna have when you describe a casual game at sounds terrible, but I believe you that it's really awesome"
