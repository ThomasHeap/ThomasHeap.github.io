0.0,10.4," Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. This is the podcast for July 30th, 2008. I'm here with the mostly regular crew."
12.120000000000001,14.120000000000001, We got Chuff. Is that work on you now?
14.120000000000001,19.64, That's what Sean calls me. So is that really all call you? That's your nickname. That's which you told us you are.
20.04,28.92," Well, that's what I that's my avatar and MMOs your dad was asking you what Jeff money was. It's true my dad did call me an ask me what Jeff money meant because he had been listening"
28.92,33.06, I have no idea why he asked me. I figured it out Anthony was saying that he's like
33.06,38.02," Yeah, he's his body is in the base most listen and I was like no dude. Is that the name in your email account or something?"
38.02,42.24, And he confirmed it wasn't think about it man. Arkham's razor cut nesheet
44.6,50.08, What's funny to me is people like speculating all these weird things a chuff means when it's just apparently
50.08,56.040000000000006, It does mean some weird shit though in the UK which doesn't surprise me that that's why it would end up in the games workshop
56.04,62.64, Like dwarven language thing that I'm sure they just took like some UK slang since threatened by UK people right and threw it in there
63.0,66.12, I don't know I'm okay with that either way whatever it means
66.68,69.68, So we also got Sean and Ryan here
70.12,80.52," Hi, all right, and I get to set away quick. We talked about dollar store opening in front of your house last week right podcast right so someone sent us in a clip from a paper"
80.52,85.12," Unfortunately, it doesn't have the entire story that the following paragraph is contained in the skin"
86.2,90.2, Debra Jackson said she likes shopping at the dollar palace because it's convenient and casual
90.2,94.36000000000001, I don't have to get all dressed up like I'm going to Walmart or something she said
96.60000000000001,105.04," Yeah, that sums it up. I just want to know what's on you the property value of my house must have gone down like a hundred grants and said fucking dollar store open"
105.76,107.76, It's just
107.76,109.76, I don't do I know a thing
110.56,115.4," Because people can shop there in flip-flops. Yeah, not null offense to the blackboard base. It's getting there"
115.4,121.9, But I'm telling you man. It's like all the sudden. I'm like living in skid row the place coming in and out of that store and the people who work there too
123.64,128.24," I'm just trying to fix it with the uniform for a dollar store is when like Walmart. It's like, you know, it's like"
128.56,130.56, It's a floral shame tarp
131.28,136.12, I've been there twice now both times I'm waiting in line behind like one guy with one can to soda
136.24,137.76, You know for like 10 minutes
137.92,139.92, How could how long could this transaction be taking?
142.0,146.28, So I've been in there twice already. I'm not gone back. That's it for me in the dollar store
147.76,149.76, So that's it for this week
149.76,153.32," Sean you're not young been playing games because you're fan broke. Yeah, let's get that out of the way"
153.32,159.32," Yeah, we're scrambling last minute to try to get some game related topics because I've been out of commission with the broken CPU fan"
159.84,161.6, And we went to
161.6,163.6, Best Buy with Anthony and
163.6,165.88, They didn't have it. They didn't have any fans
165.88,170.2, You fans now and then I found out as we were shopping at comp USA's out of business
170.6,172.6, You say I got to go on the internet
172.92,176.04," Yeah, but the good thing to come out of it was I picked up the first season of the wire"
176.48,179.51999999999998, The last one and I I thought that was pretty weak
180.72,186.16," Really. Yeah, I don't know. I just hate I have this thing where if something is popular and it's proven successful"
186.16,187.51999999999998, I'm determined to hate it
187.52,192.0, So I went into it determined it and I hate it. It's it's just I actually just try to like what you like
192.20000000000002,196.52, So even though I've loved all what was it six seasons now? I don't like it
196.88,200.8," That you said you don't well, that's cool. That allows us to continue to have a working really right"
201.12,207.32000000000002," Yeah, it was kind of overrated now. We could talk about it later and podcast, but actually think it's incredible is as everyone else does"
207.32000000000002,208.60000000000002, It's phenomenal
208.60000000000002,212.08," Yeah, the cool thing is you're trying to buy all the other seasons. I don't want to over-hype it"
212.08,215.92000000000002," But you're very much kept at the iceberg. That's what everyone says. Yeah, yeah"
216.04,221.05999999999997, We'll come back to that after we talk about the game stuff because of course. That's the number one thing in my mind
221.05999999999997,226.2," No, we still wire the wire. Yeah, you were we need as a wire playing some"
226.44,227.72," Hey, you played games. I"
228.39999999999998,234.27999999999997, Did but like most of the games I played I can't talk about because of you know in bargos and whatever
234.27999999999997,238.48," It's always weeks, you know like yeah cuz warhammer online"
238.48,241.0, I would love to talk about that can't you know
241.16,243.16, Graham I played episode one I
243.68,245.44, Maybe I could sort of talk about that
245.76,251.42, Lich King you're saving for legendary thread just as like I just got done doing a big discussion about so caliber
252.4,258.52, I want to show basically let's just pimp every other podcast that we're doing this is basically what's going to be this week
258.76,260.76, We'll tell us about grim then
261.4,266.96," Well, what can I say and not say? I don't know the game comes out on the 31st on game tap"
266.96,270.48," I think it's exclusive for game tap. Yeah, yeah"
271.40000000000003,280.6, And they're gonna be releasing weekly episodes and if they are all as long as this one then I definitely recommend you just wait a few weeks
280.6,284.12, Because this thing was maybe half an hour at the most right?
284.12,287.40000000000003," Well, well if you're already subscribed to games have the way that that works"
287.40000000000003,293.28000000000003, It's like you're not paying for that you you're already a member for some flat fee and that's just something else
293.28000000000003,295.76," You know how that says to oh I see yeah, duh"
296.28,298.28, Is it a free download then?
298.28,303.15999999999997, Well for game tap. That's not free. It's if you if say if you whatever their rates are nowadays
303.15999999999997,307.4," It's like eight dollars a month or something. Yeah, so you'll get everything in their library plus"
307.4,310.48, I see access to that game. TV commercials now
311.12,317.12," They had for some time no in the middle of games. Well, it's like what as you click download in the games downloading before you play"
317.12,322.88," It'll like I was just getting the notification. It's advertised on television. Well, maybe I don't watch an FTV"
322.88,327.2, I just remember I've been seeing a lot of Street Fighter 2 champion edition commercials lately
327.76,330.76, That's a weird one. You just gave me a good advertising
332.71999999999997,337.0, Idea that I'm gonna pitch to the game companies commercials in the middle of games
337.68,341.58, That's not a good idea. So like you're playing half life episode three and you're you know
341.58,346.32, You're running through a level and all of a sudden it like cuts to a commercial like you stop playing and you got to wait
346.32,349.15999999999997, Like it just works that way like you're like an end-suit drive
349.88000000000005,354.8," Actually, that is something I haven't played like I mentioned that after a grand yeah, but like say you're playing quick live"
354.8,359.12," And obviously you're about you know, it's first to fifty frags and you're on right fry for 48 and all of a sudden. It's like"
364.12,366.12, Feeling hungry
366.12,371.52000000000004," Yeah, that'd be awesome. Oh, God. I'm gonna work on that that when I leave when I finally leave this dump. That's what I'm gonna do"
371.52000000000004,378.64000000000004, I can do this just says to take the feeling hungry brought about is I was talking with worry about how in the hot cases and grocery stores
379.32000000000005,382.84000000000003, Everything is the same color right and I've known this forever
382.84000000000003,388.18, But I was it was funny to see that BBC world news did the story on it and so yeah
388.18,395.24, Everything in the cases the same it doesn't matter if it's a mojo potato or egg roll or a chicken leg or like fried mac and cheese
395.24,397.72, Everything is this is do brown and
398.48,403.12, There's this new thing where you get up they put a hot pocket in there in the colorful
403.64,409.68, foil wrapper and they actually sell that we were like searching for pictures these cases and we found
409.84000000000003,414.0," The internal memo like telling you know, grocery store managers like you want these hot pockets in here"
414.0,417.24," Cause it adds color to your case, but of course if you pull the pocket out it's the same"
418.24,422.28000000000003, same color is the thing but it's like put tin foil in here for so why is everything brown?
422.76,424.8, Like they all fry it in the same grease. Yeah
427.48,432.24," No, I'm back to grin. Okay. Yeah, okay. Well, you know"
432.76,438.28000000000003, It really works together because grim is about covering the world and shit in those cases are it's weird
438.28000000000003,441.84000000000003, They don't actually come out and say that really that he's like
442.48,447.52," Shitting everywhere well, I don't like a dark cloud that's following grim around yeah"
447.52,452.08, You could interpret it that because when he's standing still when you're not moving the cursor then he's peeing
452.40000000000003,457.12, So it's like a point and click adventure. I really don't know no no no. It's not it's more along like
458.12,461.90000000000003," No, no, I think more along you think way lower really rude a mystery like catamar"
462.8,468.98, Where you're you're in this world and you need to cover the whole thing in it's colorful and vibrant
468.98,472.64, You need to turn the whole thing. It's kind of like a lawnmower sim
473.08,479.68, Really you're just grim and you're just moving your cursor around just trying to cover everything in black and once you do that
480.24,482.88, To a certain you know there's different levels of
483.76,485.76, You know it starts out
486.12,490.08, You start at at zero with the world clean and pretty and then there's like notches
490.08,494.24, So it's like stinky smelly vile whatever and so he'll
495.2,501.44, Like that's the only challenges like okay now you gotta go from stinky to vile just isn't catamari where you click
501.44,506.24, And I've items then you're able to roll over increasingly larger items and this you become more powerful
506.24,508.96, And you're able to convert things that you previously couldn't convert
509.52,513.4399999999999, Turn them crappy you know this is this is I didn't notice that to be honest
513.4399999999999,518.64, I didn't notice I got more powerful. I just noticed being the same thing over maybe in that first episode
518.64,524.8," It doesn't work that way, but this later on. Yeah, you have to you. I mean you'd notice because it's impossible to complete a level without okay"
525.1999999999999,529.28," Well, that's why I'm a little reluctant to talk about it just because this first episode"
529.28,531.52, I can't tell I was telling Ryan this before we started
532.3199999999999,540.4399999999999, How I would review one episode because if this one episode isn't dick at over what the entire game is gonna be across multiple episodes
541.08,543.08, I'm not gonna have a very positive
544.0400000000001,548.96, Opinion of a butt if this is just sort of like an intro and the gameplay is gonna go from here
549.4000000000001,553.4000000000001, Into other things then maybe I can see it. This is absolutely
553.4000000000001,559.88," My reaction when I played it at GDC yeah, and you know, I was kind of like looking for reassurance and asking like okay"
559.88,564.2, You're just introducing the basic right principles here and then you're gonna iterate on the isn't gonna
564.2,568.76, But correct substantially more complicated except the problem is is that with the episodic game you have to assume
569.24,574.08, That any number of your people in your audience are experiencing episode whatever
574.64,579.76," Yeah, first time in the game so you always have to have the equivalent of like the training"
579.76,585.14, We right in every episode so it's never really going to get that much more complicated
585.14,589.24, There's some like I was platforming elements some some pretty real-enreplattering elements
589.24,593.48, But in what I saw of it might be jumping around the whole game
594.08,598.3199999999999," It's pretty much what you're looking at now. Yeah, that's not so hot"
598.32,603.9200000000001, I mean in the other problem of course is that every episode I assume is gonna be sort of self-contained because they're different fairy tales
603.9200000000001,605.9200000000001," Right, it's not like this is a continuing story"
606.96,612.0400000000001," I would think I mean I don't know I haven't seen episode two three or four, but this one was the"
612.0400000000001,614.0400000000001, I was a called the boy who
614.6800000000001,616.6800000000001, Who wanted who
616.6800000000001,621.36," Needed to know what fear was I forget the exact title, but the next one has nothing to do with that"
621.36,624.7600000000001, It's another grim fairy tale so how would it even continue?
624.7600000000001,625.7600000000001, I don't know
626.52,630.56," Well, you could put them together and some you can have some like framing narrative that says"
631.76,635.48," Grimm is going across all the these stories, you know"
635.88,640.76," The people in each fairy tale don't communicate with one another, but Grimm's able to visit the existence"
640.76,647.0," Yeah, you're right that could I don't know. I don't know what you thought the graphics are are kind of funny and neat"
647.0,649.0, they've got this kind of
649.3199999999999,652.3199999999999, Like fractured fairy tale sort of goofy
653.12,659.1800000000001," Sort of mock primitive look, but they're actually semi sophisticated looks like it reminded me of some of those"
659.1800000000001,661.58, I forget the artist put up children's books where it's cut out
661.58,665.22," It's montages, but made with like scrap paper and stuff yeah colorful"
665.22,669.72, I think the game looks fantastic and that was kind of my concern is that it was basically a showpiece
669.96,674.7600000000001," Yes, they've got this art style down and it's and it's also fun to see the transformation"
674.7600000000001,678.6, You know these characters and stuff and then you see them they don't just get covered in black
678.6,680.6, But their world actually changes physically
680.6,685.16," So there's some yeah, it's suddenly be like a flint you know spinning guillotine or something"
685.16,691.36, There's some good. Tell a well-known flying right you go past a children's playground and there's you know kids on a
692.12,694.12, What's a called you know one of those
694.6800000000001,700.82, Paralyze monkey bar things and then when you go over it with blacks and the kids are like literally hanging like you know
700.82,705.26, By their neck and it's it's it made me laugh as I went through all those things
705.26,709.96, But it's it feels a bit one joke right imagine like if you had a book for kids
709.96,715.2, And it was like you have a page it shows a fairy tale and there's a panel and you pull it out and you see this transformation
715.44,718.08, But what if that book was like a thousand pages long?
718.08,724.96," Yeah, and that's all there was and yeah every page was the same one after another that it's how it feels the dialogue and the"
725.36,729.84," Voice acting is also very funny, you know, so they do do a good job of"
730.6800000000001,735.24, Kind of telling this sort of a reference thing it really reminded me of fractured fairy tales
735.24,739.24, I don't know as a reference you guys even now what I'm talking about I think so I told for that
739.24,742.12, So like garbage broke it factory fairy tales was like a
742.76,744.88, Bowling cool right it was part of all the way
744.88,753.0, They told like goofy versions of popular fairy tales. That's kind of what this is yeah like all the way around and that whole part of it the whole story is very fun
753.0,755.0, But the gameplay I
755.0,759.4, I don't know we're just gonna have to see on the on future episodes right and
759.72,764.72, Group on the played a little quick live and it's pretty much as advertised
764.72,771.44," It's quick three the plays in your browser, but better looking in some ways because they're able to do things with the textures and it"
772.0,778.48, Like if you go to full screen it automatically scans like your computer and we'll adjust to the highest setting that you can handle
778.48,785.2, So it looks nice it plays as well as quick three arena is always played. Is this problem? Is this a beta?
785.52,787.52," Yes, okay"
787.52,790.1600000000001," The only problem isn't the game itself as so much as me, you know"
790.3199999999999,796.0799999999999, Rather than really experimenting with the matchmaking and stuff or having you know none of the people in our play group have access yet
796.0799999999999,798.8, So it was just me a popped into a server and it was like oh
799.1999999999999,804.64, Here's the duties been playing since this game came out not quick live with quick three and it's like impossible
804.64,809.36, You can't even kill these people. Also. It's just like regular quick and I thought I was really good at quick three
809.36,813.8399999999999, Like well I mean subjectively really good among people that aren't like truthy good
814.4,819.92," And yeah, it was like the first serve I ended up in was just populated with those people and this is the deal with this game"
820.88,825.76, I believe that so many people would love to play it and could get it get a handle for it and enjoy it
826.0799999999999,830.0799999999999, But if like if you're used to being empowered and Halo and stuff and all of a sudden you turn this on you like hey
830.0799999999999,834.8, This is free. It's fun. Let's try this. I end that sucks. You're just gonna you're not even it's not even like Halo
834.8,839.1999999999999," Where you throw grenade and you're gonna get a kill and you'll be like okay, that's cool like you will not get a single point"
839.1999999999999,841.1999999999999, They should have a vending process for this
841.5999999999999,843.1999999999999, You know for the quick
843.1999999999999,848.24," For this version if you've ever played quick before you're out. Yeah, like so it's only for"
848.96,853.84," Well, they can have yeah, I mean this is based on this fair. Why are these guys coming into this one now too?"
853.92,860.16," Yeah, but they will they should want to to segregate themselves because it's only fun for them to play against people that are"
860.5600000000001,866.48," Competitive too, right? I would say so yes if there's one or two people that were like microwave equivalent in your game"
866.48,869.44, And you had a bunch of people that were competitive then it's fun because it's like yeah
869.44,875.24, This is the wild card. This is how like say if I'm behind the the leaderboard by like four frags like you know
875.32,878.6800000000001, Where this the spawn points are you like just pick up the the remainder on him
878.6800000000001,884.6, But if every one in the game was that way if no it would be like unless you just wanted to practice like trick jumps and rail going and stuff
884.6,885.5600000000001, You know
885.5600000000001,887.8, We're running the same thing with company heroes all the time
887.8,893.08, The only fun games we have really have are the ones where it's like it gets really hairy and we think we might actually lose
893.24,894.2, Yeah
894.2,898.84," Yeah, it's just it's always we're finding a great competition and so I can't critique that because I don't know"
898.84,902.44," Like I said I haven't really messed with the matchmaker. Yeah, I can you make your own server"
902.6800000000001,906.84, So you can you can lock it for just your friends like I could say hey us four we're gonna
906.84,911.4000000000001," I'm gonna make a game come on in and we could do it. Yeah, but I'm excited for it though because"
911.96,919.4000000000001, I mean it shows you I mean the potential for these like browser-based games is pretty huge and it's like and when it's out of the close beta
919.8800000000001,925.1600000000001, And it all it ever is as a matter of like pasting a URL into an aim or event window or something
925.1600000000001,926.36, I mean that's pretty cool
926.36,932.0400000000001," Yeah, I got a little bit of grief on my blog because I did that I did my top 10 PC games of E3"
932.6,940.6800000000001, Earlier this week and I put RuneScape HD on there and the reason I put it on there was not because I think RuneScape is such an amazing game
941.08,949.32, But the fact that if you've seen the HD version it's looking pretty good for what is a browser-based game
949.32,955.8000000000001," I mean again, this is a phone MMO that now has 3D graphics that are you know at least as good as ever"
955.8000000000001,960.6800000000001," Quest. I mean right so I know ever quest is old now, but still it's free but in fact there isn't a browser"
960.76,967.8," And one thing about amazing right it's like you're saying I could give you the URL and then you could be playing this free MMO forever, you know"
968.52,972.5999999999999, I'm okay with free browser games like that or even like instant action when we're playing tribes
972.5999999999999,977.56, I was surprised at how well that ran in the phone legions empire falling into the entire size
977.56,984.3599999999999," I say it is like tribes that yeah, yeah, there's huge potential for that and the fact that like I mean when we're in best by"
985.24,989.88, When you go out the checkout line it's like either side is like all the what is it?
989.88,991.08, What is it called those persons?
991.08,997.56, All the impulse by shit on either side is all video games now and it's crap is it really for PS2 and Xbox and we're like
998.12,1005.72, There's like a huge market for people that aren't like they're looking for value over all these other things and it's like you can't beat the value of totally free
1005.96,1009.24," You know, so what are some of the games in this like impulse thing?"
1009.96,1016.68," It's like right before we like yeah, it'll be like two for one shitty PSP games like shrink wrap together like that sort of thing"
1016.8399999999999,1022.1999999999999," Yeah, I mean like stuff what it was this one primal or review that on PS2 way back when that came out"
1022.1999999999999,1026.36," There's gonna be some fans of that game that are gonna be saying that's not shitty, but I didn't think it was the best"
1027.1599999999999,1031.6399999999999," I got some parents much just be like yeah, throw those on the card for my fucking kid"
1031.6399999999999,1035.6399999999999," So yeah, it made me a little like it keep it in the night. Yeah, it's like the new"
1036.44,1039.56, You know you're in the grocery store and I was kid they would have they wouldn't have toys
1040.04,1043.24," Isles, but they would have like by the cereal there'd be like this this little peg"
1043.56,1048.24, You have like an army man in the car in it like that's the new equivalent like to the SK guys
1050.24,1052.24, Don't choke on it
1054.52,1057.52, That's kind of sad kids will ask for them to I would be I
1057.92,1060.6, Do damn well. I didn't want them except the burden
1061.72,1065.68, I do think that these I mean this is no major inside
1065.68,1069.78, I'd but I do think these free games are just gonna increasingly dominate the
1070.58,1075.98," The PC space you know, I mean I think you know watching like EA's doing with battlefield heroes and"
1078.54,1081.3, I mean my question's gonna be like how any of them
1082.5,1088.98, I know like what do you think let me turn into question? Do you think battlefield heroes is actually gonna work and succeed?
1088.98,1092.8999999999999, I imagine so I wish that it'd give me access to the beta going on right now
1092.8999999999999,1095.78," Well people are playing that, but I really don't see why not"
1096.74,1101.7, I mean I don't know how much money initially they have to make back like I can't imagine
1101.7,1107.78, I'm trying to of course it'll be easier for EA to support that then right it start up right if they say that they have
1108.7,1112.66," If they put out a beta and there's like 200,000 people sign up just for that beta"
1112.74,1117.08, Then they can go to advertisers and say like look at any given like in any day
1117.24,1123.18, We have this many different eyes like on this space and then that number expands through word of mouth
1123.18,1128.2, I mean that's the thing as long as you keep keep the content coming in the game's good enough to keep people playing over prolonged periods
1128.8200000000002,1131.8200000000002, Then you just show those figures advertisers and they don't say no
1131.8200000000002,1134.94, You're not to mention are they doing micro transactions for that like like
1135.42,1140.0600000000002, By doing they watch that thing. I mean that's hope that's whole part of the thing about you know clearly
1140.0600000000002,1145.0600000000002, They're one well they're not wondering but they they're hedging their bets how to how to recover their costs on it
1145.0600000000002,1150.38, And so it's like well we can advertise a little we can sell some things and I figured they're probably not counting on anyone
1150.38,1155.8600000000001, But the combination of all these different ways of bringing in income or how they're gonna like you know profit from these
1156.66,1165.1000000000001, What I learned when I talk to next on a while ago and maybe I brought it up on this podcast before I I always bring up everything 20 times was just how
1166.1000000000001,1168.1000000000001, How few
1168.1000000000001,1173.8600000000001, How small the percentage has to be of micro transactions amongst the player base for them to turn a profit
1173.8600000000001,1175.8600000000001, I mean that's the amazing thing
1175.86,1180.6599999999999," Yeah, when next on came in and showed cart writer for the first time and they said something like you know"
1180.6599999999999,1183.26, We've got like whatever five percent
1183.86,1187.86," Player-based buying things. I was like oh shit. I'm sorry and they were like no, no, no"
1187.86,1194.9399999999998, That's like huge in this thing. How many players how many people play that game is it in the millions a lot?
1195.58,1200.6999999999998," Mania, I don't know so speaking of free games. I'm just wondering if you guys know because I forget like I'm"
1200.7,1206.72, Reading something about my favorite like what what happened to mythos after flagship clues that is that still gonna occur
1206.72,1208.72, Cause man I like that when we played it
1209.22,1213.3, She didn't play it all along and you would have answered that question. I liked it that much
1213.3,1216.3400000000001," I liked it when you're playing if we all moved on, you know the buzzard"
1216.3400000000001,1223.46," But it was I don't I don't know it's ongoing. Yeah, my current understanding is there's there's a limbo thing going on here"
1223.46,1227.46, That's just how gate gets snapped up by someone. I think well
1227.98,1231.42, How game and mythos both were were taken over
1233.3400000000001,1237.14, Gs we need the details of the story before we can talk about it on the podcast
1237.6200000000001,1241.22," But but flagship flagship lost it, you know, we've"
1242.74,1247.06, And we've actually contacted flagship to to get a story about it which
1247.8600000000001,1252.14, Is going to happen at some point. So it's a big mess
1252.66,1258.42, It's leaving me over me also on the same free game. It's that we just next on broadening combat arms again yesterday
1258.42,1265.42," Yeah, how's that I talked about it before I played it. It's kind of like it's a decent FPS somewhere between like"
1267.0200000000002,1271.1000000000001," Counter strike and call duty, but somewhere in between"
1271.5800000000002,1274.6200000000001, Sort of you know the way that the in the speed no way that the game functions
1274.6200000000001,1279.88, But of course it's not really competitive with either one of those if you were to put them on the shelf and that's the same price more
1279.88,1283.74, More but for a game that you can just jump in for free and kind of have fun with
1284.46,1286.64, I definitely recommend that people try it
1286.64,1290.5200000000002, I don't know if it's kind of thing where they're going to want to keep playing which is obviously what they need you to do
1291.0800000000002,1294.8600000000001, But the interesting thing too that came out is when they were saying that in Korea now
1296.2600000000002,1301.1200000000001, It's free FPS is that are the number one games which is you know
1301.1200000000001,1306.74, We know how popular the RPGs are already there. So to hear that I mean that kind of also explains why you see
1307.48,1312.18, It and and dice and stuff now working working that same angle
1312.86,1317.84, Especially with Korea where it just seems like everyone there plays a crazy amount of PC games and particular
1317.96,1320.6200000000001, Those guys were pretty cool too. We were kind of like given them shit
1320.6200000000001,1325.04, We were just like you were just pretty much being honest. I was telling flat out because I was like
1325.3,1329.64, You know about five of us in our gaming group and played the game and we had mixed reactions and you know
1329.64,1332.94, There's things that we make fun of and like one of them you know that the
1333.3,1338.1200000000001, The audio things when you press and we were reminded yesterday another one is like you are so
1338.68,1343.3, Respectable and you say these things as you're fighting and so we kept saying that you know
1343.3,1347.78, What as they were showing us the game where like you know you charge for these like don't don't get rid of these like these are
1348.06,1352.3400000000001, These are what get this gave by dead and like you just like maybe add an animation
1352.74,1359.94, Something and like give us some new heart and they were throwing out ideas to they were like we should let our user base vote on what other ones will be that you can say to each other
1360.66,1362.66, way does that like a disk
1363.3,1369.7, Not like that's like a high five move you can also say like why are so respect there's a WTA button and it says like I don't know if it's
1370.22,1374.5800000000002, Fit to this maybe it is it's hard to say you just can say whatever you want or you are the hero
1374.5800000000002,1380.5," And the other one is like yeah, I forget the one about crazy. Oh"
1380.98,1382.98, What the heck are you doing yeah
1384.6200000000001,1386.6200000000001, But there we go. You know
1386.6200000000001,1390.66, I sent this out you guys doesn't sound like you had time to check it over
1390.66,1397.4," But I wanted to bring it up to see where we stand on it. Yes, sir. Steven to Tilo at MTV multiplayer just put up a little mini interview"
1397.6200000000001,1400.8600000000001, We thought Howard a bit that's the working on Fallout 3
1401.5,1407.5, And he's kind of talking about you know in this game you can you can play the good guy or you can play the bad guy guy like so many other
1407.5,1409.5, You know games
1409.5,1413.26, But it's kind of like the Han Solo middle ground that's like less explored
1413.42,1418.14," Well, we talked about it when you're talking about when you're talking about when you're showing me when we're talking about bio shock back when is that you can"
1419.0200000000002,1424.3400000000001," Save that you could harvest little sisters, you know, or you could save them and that the game outside of"
1424.3400000000001,1428.3400000000001, Of there's one exception and that's if you harvest the first one and then save all the rest
1428.3400000000001,1429.7800000000002, You'll still get the good ending
1429.7800000000002,1433.8200000000002," But there's no you know, there's no middle ground where you know like like the way I played"
1433.8200000000002,1437.1000000000001," I harvest six and then have a change of heart and start saving the rest, you know right?"
1437.46,1440.0600000000002, So I'm curious if like if if in your knowledge
1440.3000000000002,1442.3000000000002, Are there any games that have really
1442.98,1446.18, Explored that or at least you know taking that into account where
1446.9,1452.5, There's something other than you're you're playing the bad guy. You're playing the good guy and there's kind of a difference to between someone who just
1453.74,1459.3," Someone who's kind of going back and forth, you know like I mean the whole thing with Han Solo is supposed to be like, you know"
1459.3,1464.18," Mercenary, you know you're sometimes you're you're behaving on weight and sometimes another or like wired character"
1464.18,1466.18, I'd like characters in the wire
1466.18,1471.3600000000001, As opposed to just someone who's kind of like I'm just going through it and I don't know
1471.8600000000001,1475.46," Option B is always the best answer to the questions. Well, don't you think that"
1475.78,1481.3, I mean it seems to me like the bio our games kind of always let you do that to some extent
1481.3,1485.54," But in yeah, but in the end they always have an ending that's like ultra good or ultra bad"
1485.54,1488.58, Why are you talking so are you talking about just in terms of how it affects the ending?
1489.3,1490.9, Because I can like I
1490.9,1495.06, Those are two things. I think they're both worth addressing right so you're saying that the bioers games
1496.02,1501.38," Allow you to argue hide the space in the middle right? Well, I just play do they react to that along the way as well"
1501.38,1505.38, Because those games aren't just about the ending. They're also about and they what they will react
1505.54,1507.46, I mean in mass effect for example
1508.02,1512.98, There were certainly times where I would I mean for the most part I always play especially the first time
1513.38,1517.54," Play a game as good, you know, I'll I'll be the good guy and help everybody"
1517.78,1520.82, But there were there were a couple missions where I just felt like I'll fuck this
1520.82,1526.02, I don't want to do it so I would always take like the the last answer on the dialect tree which is basically like you know
1526.66,1529.6200000000001, The go fuck yourself answer and then if you do that
1530.1799999999998,1536.7399999999998," Um, in in mass effectively, so that would either open up or close up a particular plot point"
1537.3,1542.4199999999998," So it was definitely affecting the game. I mean, so what I'm saying is like I was mostly a good guy"
1542.4199999999998,1549.62, But there were sometimes when I was being the arrogant ass and the game was changing because I did that right like I couldn't solve another quest
1550.02,1555.9399999999998, In the easiest possible way because I had been a dick to these other people right so it's in her it's telling though
1556.1000000000001,1560.5, When you start it off you say you begin these games and you go into them assuming
1560.5,1567.14," I'm going to be this or that and I'm going to be good. Yeah, that's opposed to like I'm just gonna go in and be myself and whatever happens"
1567.14,1572.98, I'm gonna react to each decision and and judge it on its own merits and and whatever happens happens like you know
1572.98,1578.5, Like again like and keep bringing up the wire because that's my lens for the week is like am I gonna take the money this time
1578.8200000000002,1582.3400000000001," Or am I gonna leave it you know like what if I take the money next week, you know"
1582.82,1589.9399999999998," Well, I definitely was especially in mass effect more where I felt a little looser than I did for whatever reason then and and say"
1590.1799999999998,1596.74, The D&D games that I thought I was judging it based on like what am I gonna get out of this right you know
1597.3,1603.54," So to some extent it was like that, but but I actually don't know how it ultimately affected the ending"
1603.54,1604.8999999999999, I don't know if there was a
1604.8999999999999,1606.8999999999999, Fall out type situation where there were
1607.38,1611.8600000000001, Multitudes of things that could happen depending on what you did throughout the game right
1613.22,1618.02, I don't know I'm really rackin my brain and I can't come up with like a single game
1618.5800000000002,1626.02, Or I think about someone that you kind of play like that like I think maybe in some way like the only game that comes to mind is like Starcraft when you're playing is like
1626.66,1631.7800000000002, The gym-ranor character. He's kind of like that and the fact that he's like kind of doing what's good
1631.78,1637.06, But he also like will straight up just kill a random colony of people like right to do what he thinks right
1637.06,1639.3799999999999," Of course you're not making any decisions there, right?"
1639.94,1644.5," That's a good watch guy. Yeah, yeah, that's a thing. Yeah, yeah, like I don't know I mean"
1645.22,1649.3799999999999," I think maybe the new fable yeah, I was gonna mention that I didn't play the first one"
1649.62,1652.82," Well, so I was taught how are claiming that that's what fall three is gonna do"
1653.1399999999999,1656.5," sort of put you know, he was just in a really he was saying that like yes, I mean"
1657.14,1662.1, As you play the game is going to to be able to accommodate you if you're sort of you know
1662.1,1664.58, Resulating between these these you know polls
1665.22,1671.3," But in the big scheme of things though he was saying like I don't know I think the final question, you know"
1671.7,1673.7," He was kind of like well, it's not quite that"
1673.7,1674.42, Uh-huh
1674.42,1675.06, I don't know
1675.06,1680.5, We'll follow all our one and two are good examples of that where you know throughout those games you could
1681.14,1689.46, Up to help or be a jerk or be indifferent or whatever and you know like I said and has been discussed many times before that is a game
1689.46,1696.74, Or in the end the mass accumulations of your actions would play out in how the ending went
1696.74,1699.14, Right a lot of it was just told in voiceover
1699.38,1705.78, You know this thing happened because you did this or didn't do this. I think I've been playing their own kind of games because it's pretty rare that like
1705.78,1709.62," I will not their own kind of games, but I mean it's pretty rare in the games that I've traditionally played"
1709.9399999999998,1716.6599999999999," Where this is even a real issue right like a bliving and stuff, but I was like it seems like even better though because on the face when like"
1717.1399999999999,1721.1399999999999, Those kind of decisions would probably be even more meaningful like holiday before or something
1721.54,1723.54, Then a lot of these other spaces
1723.54,1728.9799999999998, It would be difficult to implement because clearly the decisions in that game or whether you shoot or whether you don't shoot
1728.9799999999998,1731.9399999999998, But they could still work you know a lot of you don't shoot thing your dad
1733.54,1738.1, It depends there could be situations. I mean there are a lot of it's just ethics right that they don't want to get into
1738.4199999999998,1741.4599999999998, There could clearly be a situation when there's a mission in the game and it's like
1742.1799999999998,1745.2199999999998, Here's this car coming at you in a checkpoint and there's no civilians in the game
1745.2199999999998,1748.98," So you it's not even a question, but in some other imaginary game, you know, it's a de-shooter"
1748.98,1750.34, Do you not should be fantastic?
1750.34,1754.1, These people freaking out or like or even things like real war right? Do you say your allies
1754.6599999999999,1758.6599999999999, Capture some people something enemy surrender to you shoot them or do you you know?
1759.2199999999998,1761.3, I got to say in the in the lich king beta
1761.3,1765.06," Well, I'm sure we'll talk about this in the next podcast and have are you in the end Ryan?"
1765.3799999999999,1767.3799999999999," Yeah, have you done the death night stuff"
1768.4199999999998,1773.62," Checked out the death night. Okay, so you can create a death night, which is the new character class in"
1774.58,1780.6599999999999, In World Warcraft and and you need to have a level 70 character to make one and but when you make one you start at level 55 and
1781.86,1783.86, Blizzard has come up with this entire
1785.3799999999999,1787.3799999999999, Kind of opening sweet of
1787.78,1793.1399999999999, Quest that you have to do to kind of train you had to use this character because it's it's unlike anything else
1793.1399999999999,1796.1799999999998, It's ever been in the game and but in terms of it's
1796.26,1798.26, Uh
1798.74,1807.0600000000002," Well the characters the death night isn't evil, you know, he's not just like bad like in the hoard like, you know a bad quote unquote bad orc"
1807.6200000000001,1811.8600000000001," Just another character yeah, he's a knight of death Sean he's one of the four horsemen"
1813.14,1817.14, He's actually evil and the storyline that those these early quests that you do are
1817.8600000000001,1823.78, Probably like the most disturbing things I've ever ever seen in any Blizzard game because they'll actually you know
1823.78,1827.94," One of the quests is actually to go around and kill a bunch of civilians, you know"
1828.42,1833.3," These are like unarmed, you know, cowering people who you know as you come up to them and hit on them"
1833.3,1839.36," They'll start saying you know, but I have a wife and kid, you know, and I think in the past save like shy away from that"
1839.36,1843.8, It's a double standard dude if running with scissors did that I'd be complaining
1844.34,1846.34, Instead of saying it's a great yeah
1847.54,1850.18, So I haven't honestly finished the death night
1850.58,1853.7, Quest sweet because I believe there's they have to make
1853.78,1860.42, So you're back into the game proper at the end of it. I believe somehow you have a turn of whatever sort of and then you're just sort of like
1861.54,1865.78," Bad in quotes is supposed to actually evil. Yeah, you went up fighting the scourge"
1865.78,1869.22," Which is who you're with when you're killing civilians, but"
1870.34,1875.7, But I do have to say that even though I did the quest because you have no choice because that's how you level up at that point
1875.7,1878.98, And that's how you advance to the next quest. It was kind of
1880.58,1883.54, Not disturbing like I was up late at night crying anything
1884.02,1889.3," Maybe a little but you know, but a little you know a little more"
1890.58,1896.62, I don't know just it was like a step I didn't actually think Blizzard would take so I thought it was kind of cool that that you have to do that
1896.62,1898.62, You know we can
1899.66,1901.66, Did you read the quest dialogue?
1901.8999999999999,1902.8999999999999, Sure
1902.8999999999999,1907.36, Why I never read that I would have missed it. I would just been like I need to kill tenities
1907.36,1911.98," Gonna go do it. See you're part of the problem, right? I am just in"
1912.14,1914.7, Society in general. I need to take the time
1915.1,1917.1, Stop and read what these people wrote
1917.22,1923.5, Somebody got paid a lot to do that. There's an instant quest text option in the interface menu for a reason
1923.5,1927.1," I know then they didn't want to put it in well, but I became the administrator"
1927.1,1929.82," I've instant quest text, but I still read it a lot of times"
1929.82,1932.46, I just have it appear all at once instead of having to read it as it appears
1932.46,1935.74, I made myself not turn that thing on so that I would read the text
1937.42,1939.42, So for people that
1939.5,1945.26," That don't have a beta invite they can obtain them. Oh, yeah, what do you got through eBay?"
1946.54,1952.7, I just I just saw randomly I'm supposed to in the internet that they're selling the people that went to the French
1952.94,1955.98, Blizzard thing they're selling those blue's con beta
1956.14,1960.22, Wrath of the Lich King passes and most expensive when I saw was like for a thousand dollars
1960.22,1963.1000000000001, But that one was okay with the cereal pat the cereal pet as well
1963.18,1964.78, So it was like good grief
1964.86,1969.1, These are from the blue's con cars from last year. Are they right?
1969.1,1973.66," They're starting over to put from a 2007. Okay, okay, okay, but that's okay. That entitles you to the beta"
1974.1399999999999,1977.58, That's the thing they went to the the Paris thing and got that car doesn't
1978.22,1980.3799999999999, Entitles you to date it entitles yeah
1980.54,1985.42, Cuz that puts you on the European server. I think and not only but that one the the reason people are paying more for it
1985.42,1987.42, Because it comes with a Merlot costume so
1988.54,1990.62, But like like these ones are like buy it now
1990.9399999999998,1996.78, 339 and the description's pretty red because it says the right off the bat is says eBay stop banning this
1997.1799999999998,1999.1799999999998, It isn't for software. WTF
2001.4199999999998,2003.4199999999998, Buy with confidence

2007.6599999999999,2014.62, Positive feedback so and he like that he emphasized that it's free shipping when he also says that there's like a sticker on this
2014.62,2019.4199999999998, I will scratch the card and email you the code and only you the code it is unused like it
2019.5,2023.74, That's all it's for and it's is free shipping and the the auction right beneath that though is like true

2028.46,2031.5800000000002, He's like undercutting that guy but like it's by like a silver basically
2035.98,2038.54," Yes, he merlot code and a rest of the lich king code"
2039.1000000000001,2040.14," Wow, you need it"
2040.14,2045.1000000000001, I'm telling you it's not worth it if you're listening and you think that you want the wow beta that bad
2046.14,2049.34, You don't it's funny. It's just down. It's funny. It's the game might be

2057.7400000000002,2062.94," Oh, what is that really that's in two days? Wow fucking a couple days. Is that true? That can't be I"
2062.94,2065.9," He probably means September 1st a bit. Yeah, that can't be there. Wait a month"
2065.9,2071.26," But like by the way, yeah, you're paying like $400 for a month on either way. Are your character is your character progress from the beta?"
2071.26,2075.34, I'm gonna carry over town right you're gonna lose your progress plus it's a beta
2075.34,2081.26, I mean there's a ton of shit that's broken. I mean I haven't been able to log in you know for most of the past 24 hours
2081.26,2085.1400000000003, That's like the fucking FBI. It's in trap meant dude. They're trying to like get freaks

2096.78,2100.1400000000003, Swaggery sale watch where we like you know when we go to these press events
2100.1400000000003,2101.98, We know what what they're giving out for free

2118.38,2120.38, As pets as seed
2120.38,2125.5," Microsoft press conference. Yeah, you know, I used to work at it was my first job at Zif actually"
2125.7400000000002,2130.86, Back when this was company was bigger and had money they had a computer book division
2131.02,2134.86, So they made computer books and that's what I did way before you guys like were born and
2135.9,2141.5, I didn't know like the whole time that I worked there that like the other editors like taking these books and
2141.5,2147.5," Eevee's gets have seen computer books, right there. He's big fucking fat like 600. He's things and they cost like 40 bucks"
2147.82,2152.78, Everybody else there was taking these books and going straight to the book stores are in the bayrean
2152.78,2158.1400000000003, Selenum for credit and I had no idea that anybody else is doing that. I saw one guy like
2158.7,2163.3399999999997, Like I didn't work during anymore and I like went to his house and he had like a stack of the books and he was gonna take him
2163.3399999999997,2164.8599999999997, And I'm like what are you doing? He's like
2165.2599999999998,2167.2599999999998, What do you mean like this is what we all did?
2167.2599999999998,2172.06," Trying to eat eb books. Yeah, and he was actually smart because he was taking him to a store that had um well"
2172.2999999999997,2177.3399999999997," That was weird Mike that's shit now. Yeah, he took him to a store that sold books and CDs"
2177.66,2179.66, So he was trading computer books

2184.62,2188.54, I didn't take advantage so anyway. I'm bringing that up because I'm now I'm gonna start doing that here
2188.7000000000003,2194.2200000000003," Let's start selling shit. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that if you like look over our like policies when you get high"
2194.2200000000003,2196.2200000000003, I think that's not allowed
2197.1800000000003,2200.2200000000003, Just a certain reasons for it
2200.94,2202.94," Yeah, I don't know"
2202.94,2207.7400000000002, Maybe you think like the shirts and shit we get every day would sell if we put them up on eBay
2208.3,2211.5, I don't know like every now and then we have the giveaways
2211.74,2214.3," Yeah, we should just do an exciting sense of the off-"
2214.3,2219.74, I do I have a drawer full of stuff that I've store to give away to people on the boards
2220.3,2224.46," I need to remind teens like oh, we always need some kind of contest, you know"
2224.78,2231.42, But do you think if he sold it if we sold it if we did a side walk sale? Let's say the office people would buy it and we just put like two dollars on how about like that
2231.42,2234.06, Dwarf shirt that I got what is that shirt remember that shirt?
2234.62,2239.1," No, that's the bling gnome the bling gnome that's it and you got the plastic bling gnome toy"
2239.1,2240.3," Right, and what does this shirt?"
2240.3,2241.1800000000003, What does it look like?
2241.1800000000003,2244.2200000000003, I'm saying it's a second something with my no-mees or something
2244.2200000000003,2246.0600000000004," Yeah, I'm rolling with my no-mees"
2246.78,2249.9," I think someone would buy that shirt. Is that a wow shirt? No, it's not a wow"
2249.9,2253.98," Dungeon rotters would you wear it? Oh God, I think you some I mean I guarantee you at any event"
2253.98,2258.0600000000004, We go to one of our users would have who's Ryan like some side shirt
2258.6200000000003,2261.02," Wait, am I wearing it? What shirt am I wearing? What are you wearing?"
2261.02,2262.86," No, it's not a video game shirt"
2262.86,2268.6200000000003, It's a shirt that has a zombie on it with a computer and it says what your mind will fix computer for brains
2268.94,2270.62, I got my maths effect shirt on
2271.2599999999998,2273.2599999999998, We need to start
2275.02,2278.06, Because these shirts that we get are are usually
2278.94,2282.7799999999997," So large yeah, we could start selling them at XL leaving dot com"
2283.2599999999998,2287.9, Which is a site that we found recently and it's basically a number of they just have items for
2288.46,2293.02, What it says extra large living so some of the his items could you know include?
2293.02,2297.1, There's a it's basically a toilet paper wand so when you need to
2297.74,2304.86, wipe and you can't reach you can use the wand they have like a tonneau clipper attached to like a three foot rod and with
2304.86,2309.5," Bring things you're not kidding. No, I'm serious. Is there all it looks on on the site? It was pretty amazing"
2309.5,2312.22," It's like a look in another world seen the stuff you know, there's like a"
2312.7799999999997,2317.5, These slings so that when you want to get yourself in bed or something you put under your foot and then you raise your
2318.22,2324.7, Your legs up and then adjust them and then they have like all the humans and wally it is yeah and they had like the
2325.58,2328.06, Clothing and had this like one it was like a
2328.7799999999997,2332.14, Spaceately a hospital gown with floral print and it was 10 XL
2333.3399999999997,2335.3399999999997, And we called that a floral shame tarp
2336.7799999999997,2341.98, But they also so coat hangers so the coat hangers can hold a hundred pounds so I was thinking like
2343.1,2347.66, I don't what what hard to go of clothing. I mean you've got to have like a cop film hanging a body
2347.66,2352.06, And I caused it to get to a hundred pounds no matter how much material we're talking about man
2352.7,2358.7," Yeah, that's that site's it's an interesting thing to look at especially there's like a there's like a recall page"
2358.94,2361.9, And it was the items they recall and they had like the sturdy hammock and
2362.62,2368.06," Basically if you read the product description, it's more or less constructed with like the cables that hold up the golden"
2376.06,2380.62, Like there's a product recommendation just like you did if that if that thing didn't work for you
2380.7,2387.18, There's only two options like you can convince Yoda and the force lift you in the bed or like you find like you're your own like
2387.42,2389.42, Creepy Titan like Atlas
2390.7799999999997,2395.9, Now we we know we probably have some heavy set listeners and it's not you're making fun of
2396.8599999999997,2400.7799999999997," What are yeah, no like I feel bad about that because I did I did have someone pmme"
2401.42,2405.02, Who's you know what over heavier said look at the sudden change and all
2405.74,2408.62, Talking about golden gate cables are like one of our heavier listeners
2409.58,2410.62, But I did feel bad
2410.62,2415.5," I'm in the same as you personalizing like yeah, I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings like I have nothing against you"
2415.5,2418.22," I don't hate you. I don't dislike you or anything, but it's like"
2419.42,2425.8199999999997," In principle, I don't know man. I mean, maybe it's just childish, but it's funny like to me on some level and I think of like that someone has to use"
2426.22,2432.38, Like a five foot rod to cut their toenails well as long as they are using like the scissors we saw in there that have like the springs
2432.38,2435.58, So that you don't even have to put any effort and to actually using scissors
2435.8199999999997,2440.7799999999997," Yeah, that's like that's kind of the stuff that will work laughing on the site because of the descriptions to it saying like"
2441.2599999999998,2443.98, It's like save a necessary like
2444.38,2450.46," Don't waste energy unnecessarily and it's like scissors that basically cut yeah, so that sounds right out of one"
2451.02,2457.2599999999998, The other probably the worst product in there there these like plastic posts that you put in if you're on an airline flight
2457.66,2463.98, You put them in the in the seat so that the person in front of you can't recline it like locks their chair from reclining
2464.46,2469.02, And it's like talking all about like you know stop these people from taking your room and stuff and it's like well
2469.5,2475.5, Like if they paid for a seat and they want to like sleep or something like a god imagine you're flung like Tokyo or something and like you just want to
2475.5,2480.06," Wait, I don't want to put the seat back because you're too fat because yeah, like yeah, you don't want to"
2480.86,2485.26," Wow, so some of those products there right that was yeah, I think the products like what is it?"
2485.26,2491.78, It's like a rod so that you can reach your toenails. So it is well it's total clippers on the end of like a mechanism on an extending arm
2491.78,2493.78, Handle
2493.78,2497.42, Something when you need to buy that well any of that by that
2497.42,2501.5400000000004, They have like yet on the treadmill they have things like if you don't want to get up to go the bathroom
2501.5400000000004,2505.38, It takes so much work they have like five products just to help you get out of bed and there's like
2505.78,2510.7400000000002, These things to put you socks on and then like a shoehorn attached to a four foot rod
2510.7400000000002,2514.5, It's where you need a golf bag to carry this around because everything's got a rod attached to it
2514.5,2519.3, But you can't carry a golf bag. But they've got like a thing to put up they have a male and a female version
2519.3,2523.94, And if you don't want to get up to go the bathroom you just you put it down in the zone and
2524.42,2529.34," Kind of let her it makes me sad. I mean, I'm sure there's like my focus with a medical conditions that I know"
2529.34,2531.7400000000002, Is that my mic crash? I actually think it's okay
2533.54,2538.26," Yeah, anyway, so I'm also the shirts we get actually fall into that category"
2538.26,2543.26, I actually find that amazing. It's the smallest gaming shirt you ever see is a large
2543.46,2548.78, They just like know their demographics. I saw an XL women share one time the almost fit like a normal
2548.78,2552.42, Like one of us not a normal. I just mean a yeah average size person
2552.7000000000003,2557.1800000000003," Well, it's kind of I think it just in general a team remember we got these new track jackets for the staff"
2557.1800000000003,2561.5, And Tina are new community manager ordered like an extra small or something and it's still
2561.9,2564.78, Look like she's wearing like a fucking pillowcase or something
2565.7000000000003,2568.7000000000003, She's small but yeah
2569.6200000000003,2573.1000000000004, Tina barely breaks a hundred pounds man. She makes Ryan look at
2574.82,2576.82, She died. That's a good nickname
2577.78,2583.5, What size I want up track jacket to you get Ryan small small I think small does a fit
2584.46,2587.34," Yeah, I can't talk you where I don't get a mix real weird"
2589.34,2591.34, Do you wear it at all I
2591.34,2593.34, Did want your twice
2593.34,2599.06," Well, it's all what's white with like powder blue stripes on it"
2600.1000000000004,2605.86," Something about it Jeff, how did you how did you feel comfortable on it? No when I thought how did you"
2605.86,2607.86, How did you talk where you're wearing it?
2609.06,2616.46," Well, I think I did this voice. I think it was up. I remember we are all sitting on we really need to try to get more clicks on the website"
2617.78,2620.86, We really need more paid feels that's what I was going
2620.86,2628.5, I remember I saw Ryan Ryan wearing it in the conference room and I could I just remember thinking like if I was an LA and I saw Ryan on a bus wearing that
2628.5,2630.7400000000002, I would just want to fucking rob Ryan as soon as I
2630.74,2636.4199999999996," Yeah, sometimes he white did wearing that fucking thing with powder blue stripes. I just be like you know that full's got money"
2639.5,2641.5, Kevin right from the golf course
2642.14,2646.06," Yeah, so we got any other game stuff before we hit the wire"
2646.66,2647.9399999999996, Ryan tapping
2647.9399999999996,2653.2999999999997, You guys should hit the wire the oh we got like seven minutes Ryan this chance. What have you been playing right?
2653.54,2659.8799999999997, Just wrath the list king beta so it's a little caliber same as you yeah any any so caliber calling comments you want to
2660.8199999999997,2665.7," It's pretty good. I have the best still playing with the analog stick though, man"
2666.58,2668.1, Yeah
2668.1,2672.66," Okay, more power to you. I don't I don't understand like one what's so weird about that though"
2673.54,2675.54, It works better for a three-way
2675.54,2678.1, Dude if it works then it works that's the end of the story
2678.3399999999997,2684.1, But it just seems weird to a lot of people I think is because so many inputs have to do with like a double tap or
2684.74,2687.9399999999996, In a specific direction or something and it's like you want to know
2688.42,2693.7000000000003, So if you're trying to do diagonally down forward and be or something you want to make sure you're doing diagonally down forward not like
2694.02,2699.2200000000003, One degree on the analog rotation that's gonna put you into like straight forward or down or something
2699.7000000000003,2703.9," So I think it's for those reasons, but if it works for you and it gives you no problems didn't"
2705.2200000000003,2707.2200000000003, Nothing wrong with it
2707.2200000000003,2711.38, It was raising his hand like I like member of the pot. I'm just saying I don't know
2711.38,2717.42, I don't know anything about fighting games. Yeah. I don't either everyone plays the interface is always a challenge
2717.5,2721.34," with fighting games, you know like you know I play I call use instead of my thumb for the buttons"
2721.34,2726.86, Are you sure all use all the fingers on my hand and that's why I don't like to play on the ps3 gig version
2727.1800000000003,2732.46, This is because the right analog stick gets in the way of my pointer finger right and I do it that way because
2732.46,2738.46, Some of the inputs and so a caliber have to do with like pressing a and kick at the same time or a and be at the same time
2738.46,2742.3, Or being k and it's like that way I can constantly do all of those you know
2742.3,2744.3, Tap those are the shoulder buttons
2744.3,2747.9," Right, and I just never got used to that there's different reasons so people be like well if you like doing that"
2747.9,2749.5," Well, why don't you just use an arcade stick"
2749.5,2751.5, But it's like I don't like to stick on the arcade stick
2751.5,2755.6600000000003," I like the D pad and so yeah, I mean we've all got like for 2D fighting games"
2755.6600000000003,2757.82, I prefer arcade sticks but for 3D
2757.82,2764.78," I do the analog pad. Yeah, it does work for you in in one sense in that you're always in the middle of an eight way run"
2765.34,2769.42," Oh, yeah, which is the invasive technique in the game is just moving three dimensions around the stage"
2769.7400000000002,2774.94, Always like you're never moving forward or back you're always like moving that's conscious though
2775.5,2779.9," Yeah, and sometimes it gets me in a trouble, but I am the kind of person in the soul cover"
2779.9,2784.46, I'll just all side step you throw you as long as you let me but I figured out
2784.46,2787.02, But that's that's that's where I got to give you advice dude
2787.1800000000003,2790.2200000000003, As soon as you figure out you don't have any ability to change up
2790.78,2794.46," Right, I mean I'm just saying that remember when we were playing last you were doing that and I figured it out was like okay"
2795.02,2797.02, So I was just ducking like poke you
2797.58,2799.02," Right, there's nothing"
2799.02,2800.86, That it because it would catch you in your area
2800.86,2803.66, I also tend to be bad at catching low attacks
2804.06,2810.46," Yeah, that that everyone is that's why the game's like based on I mean like so many you know 3D fighting games is having a good range of like"
2810.94,2813.66, a good mix between low mid and high attacks so that you're you know
2814.7,2819.2599999999998, You obviously don't want to just consistently attack in the same height level because it'll be easier to block
2819.58,2821.58," Right, so"
2821.58,2823.58, But so caliber four
2823.58,2825.58, That's I think it's
2825.66,2829.66, Quite a bit better than three I thought three you kind of that thought you hated three though
2829.66,2833.5, I don't hate three I just didn't think it was a very much for step up from two
2834.22,2839.02, It just didn't look as good I didn't think there was there were some technical issues
2840.22,2844.62," I can't wait to take it home tonight play and I haven't I tried online yet. Yeah, yeah"
2845.58,2847.98," So I tried that yeah, you're gonna tell everyone you you"
2849.1,2853.18, You're your gamer tag so that they can throw down against your low tag shitiness
2853.74,2859.02," Right, just gonna eight way run and he's gonna try to throw you"
2859.8999999999996,2865.3399999999997," So it's just duck yeah, that's how I thought you all I got to do is duck dude and you just keep with and throws and I just stand up and throw you"
2867.74,2869.8999999999996, That did happen you have too many times
2870.62,2872.62, Maybe again in the game. I think you
2873.66,2877.1, You figured out and is it like you just want to hit me with the low touch check out the
2877.1,2879.1, My cheat the my cheat so
2880.06,2886.46," It's so caliber good. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I heard it was good. Yeah, there's there's some excellent stuff on there"
2886.7799999999997,2891.2599999999998," Yeah, I read all those character profiles. Yeah, I did it in some of those"
2891.8199999999997,2896.22, That's the thing it's kind of like the one unnecessary part is like there's a calm it tells you about the story
2897.02,2900.62," And the story is always like I've he did walk into the evil basement, you know"
2900.62,2902.62, I mean like
2902.62,2906.62, Never any sense I don't understand I had or our our cheat editor
2907.58,2910.38, He wrote most of them and he kind of
2911.02,2915.98, Pointed out how stupid some of it's not our the writers for fault on our and he didn't make it up
2916.38,2919.2599999999998," Just like his lore yeah, just some dumb"
2920.54,2922.06, They he actually
2922.8599999999997,2924.8599999999997, He paced me something on aim
2925.1,2930.62, For one of the characters like a biother came directly from Namco and it was exactly the kind of thing that
2930.94,2935.2599999999998, It's like this is an apprehensible and sorry it reads like some kind of fan that okay
2935.26,2937.26, Since I don't play these games
2937.5,2942.5400000000004, Does these character bosses are story in the game or this is like random shit in each game
2943.1000000000004,2944.6200000000003, There's a story there
2944.6200000000003,2950.94, There's not it's like they they try but it doesn't matter you just press the button the same as you're talking about quest
2950.94,2952.94, And you just press the button
2952.94,2956.38," Just click an A until the game starts. Yeah, they tried to"
2957.1000000000004,2962.0600000000004, Loosely imply that something happened that you fought for some reason and that there were some result to you
2962.54,2969.82," Meeting the last boss and yet, but it and yet what we did character bios every single day for like for every week while I was on vacation"
2970.14,2975.1," Yeah, but there's also we took that was one of the columns though the others were we're useful"
2975.1,2979.9, And those like the character strengths and weaknesses and now when you go to the site you're able to find all sorts of comments
2979.9,2986.06," Right down so yeah, so we weren't like tomorrow. I've been story yeah, like it was some big stories were in there though"
2986.06,2988.06, That was just the thing like
2988.46,2992.62, And this that's that's that's part of the deal. I mean you're supposed to associate your character
2992.62,2996.7799999999997, But I think it's like you identify more with your character because you know they got a badass upper cut or a ground throw
2996.7799999999997,2999.02," No, so is there a salt caliber fan thick then?"
2999.58,3005.42," Oh, gosh, I'm sure you could go to like deviant art and find some horrible like slash like"
3006.46,3010.94, Pictures these these characters were tailored to appeal to the people that write fan thick
3011.58,3015.1," Well, and more so they're they're tailored for well, yeah, because they're kind of blanks"
3015.1,3020.38, Lates and they're also tailored for people who who cosplay and if you look at the which are the same people
3020.54,3027.9," Yeah, if you look at the costumes in so-called before I would argue that a great many of them where we're deliberately designed"
3029.1,3033.2599999999998, In sort of response to the kinds of costumes that do it cosplayers have been making and stuff
3033.2599999999998,3036.46," It was the game with all the gigantic boobs, right? Yeah, one"
3037.66,3044.7799999999997," Well, we get the time here's the like oh, yeah, my take on the wire and that's just why like if you're if you were in the boat that I was in"
3045.18,3048.14, Prior to last weekend and you hear about it and you're not that you're certain
3050.06,3054.38, As you were saying it's realism like pretty incredible there is only you know one
3054.94,3058.62, significant thing that they had trouble suspending my disbelief on and that's when
3060.22,3066.38, The homicide and drug detectives are constantly going to rooftops inside the low rises to monitor people
3066.7799999999997,3071.9, But the way that's established everyone that lives in those communities is like hyper sensitive to the presence of anything
3071.9,3078.06, Suspicious or out of the ordinary right start screaming five oh anytime you you something like slightly off and yet
3078.38,3082.7000000000003, Episode after episode these guys are charging in the buildings and hanging out on the roof next door
3082.7000000000003,3085.1, Not once did anyone in the community. You say like
3085.82,3088.7000000000003," Dude, that's you know the guy that arrested you in the past five episodes"
3089.34,3091.58," He's going on the roof again, but yeah, I'm excited that"
3093.34,3098.9," It's phenomenal in that like you're like the other the other deterrentals like okay, it's another cop drama or something right sure"
3098.9,3101.42, and it is it portrays each season
3101.9,3107.02, It's a tackle something different I understand this first in the first one. It's a drug sales community in
3108.78,3113.82, Baltimore and the other side of the story is is the homicide and drug detectives and as they're working out
3114.06,3119.9, But it gets it's very much into it. It does really nice things in establishing parallels between the two sides of these stories
3120.2200000000003,3121.58, So
3121.58,3125.98, If a character on one end starts to try to run a side business or something a drug dealer or
3126.14,3130.46," Orlando well, he's not a dealer, but at this point he's like hey, I'm gonna try to run a side racket"
3130.46,3133.26, They'll have that story and how that will play out in that same time
3134.38,3137.42, People on the law enforcement side will be busted for
3138.54,3141.34, Trying to take their investigation in a way that their superiors
3142.54,3145.18," Didn't intend or aren't interested in taking it, you know"
3145.18,3149.5, You see parallels between you know how these individuals operate within larger organizations
3150.22,3152.22, How you have to basically
3153.18,3158.14, You know give give yourself up for what's supposed to be the greater good but at the same time everyone
3158.14,3162.22, See I mean everyone's you know trying to manipulate it to their interest and then this is the other big
3162.22,3167.98," Femes is games and gamesmanship right I mean, yeah, it's called the drug trade of course called the game, but the games working even and"
3168.9399999999996,3175.74," On not just the cops versus the drug dealers in the sense, but within their the game has a way of operating on the cop side"
3175.74,3179.98, You know when you're trying to go for promotion when you're trying to you know work that way same thing when you're trying to
3180.14,3182.38, Go from being upon to the king pin on the drug side
3183.1,3186.22, What happens if you're not technically in the game is it a game really?
3186.22,3192.7," If you know other people are brought into it all, but it just it handles everything so well the characterization is phenomenal all the performances are"
3194.38,3195.9, First rate
3195.9,3200.22," I mean, it'll be my short version of it, but it's like as soon as like I watched two episodes"
3200.22,3204.06," I was like okay, I'm watching all these and then I started eBay searching for the next season"
3204.06,3207.1," So I mean, I think it's that good. Yeah, and it really I mean"
3207.3399999999997,3211.02, It does keep getting better and the kind of parallels that you're seeing now and the
3211.66,3218.2999999999997, You know that they keep going and they they get deeper and deeper and David Simon the creator pulls the camera back a little more
3218.2999999999997,3222.7, It's season so you know you didn't even bigger picture right I mean the characters you're seeing now
3223.2599999999998,3226.06," It does change every season, but the core characters are there"
3226.06,3230.22, But you see now how they fit into the bigger picture. I can the expansion pack for an RTS
3230.22,3233.58, First starts off. There's two armies and it makes you more armies. Yeah
3234.54,3235.58, Yeah
3235.74,3241.42, It's funny that's got a lot of I mean they did sad because it makes it even when stuff's like fairly like you'd be like okay
3241.42,3245.58, If if gaming in the game is one of your you know significant themes
3246.2999999999997,3250.62," Yeah, and metaphors the story like okay if you have people standing in a in a city square"
3250.62,3253.42, Where the concrete's arranged and almost a chessboard like patterning
3253.42,3256.38," I think that's pretty obvious or something or heavy handed, but they'll do it in just the right way"
3256.38,3260.7799999999997," It's like they're not gonna find this this town square where it's like so obvious, but they'll find one you're like"
3261.5800000000004,3267.7400000000002, That was like a pretty good match cut actually from right these people playing chess to this you know right and also you know
3267.7400000000002,3271.1800000000003, want to scare people off. I mean because in addition to it being you know
3271.7400000000002,3272.94, this
3273.26,3281.42, Very serious decansian drama with all of this sort of like you know you can look at at a higher level of the structure and and probably right a pretty great
3281.98,3288.7000000000003," College thesis on it. It's also a really good crime drama. Yeah, it's also a mystery involved in every season"
3288.7,3295.2599999999998," So Mike's or yeah, the mics are awful so it's on our end so sorry instead of yeah like I was instead of like saying"
3295.98,3299.98, You know we're gonna start this episode and we're gonna solve this crime and you know
3299.98,3303.66, With the next 60 minutes or 30 minutes or whatever. They'll give you the full season and
3303.8199999999997,3306.7, Or it's basically a single case that expands exactly
3307.5,3311.58, Definitely watch this show even if you think you're not gonna like it you should just watch it
3311.58,3316.06, That's thing out. We got candy you have to dress it next time Steve Moss and it's a bag of stuff from Taiwan
3316.62,3318.62, some interesting candy a lot of dried
3318.8599999999997,3323.98, The salted plums in there in a Walmart bag. I'm at an errand simmer the head writer of armchair empire
3323.98,3328.7, Also hook me up with a bag of Canadian treats which is much appreciated. Thanks Aaron and we out
