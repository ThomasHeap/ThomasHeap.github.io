0.0,4.96, and welcome this is a special don't award to
4.96,9.200000000000001, themed installment of GFW radio I'm here with
9.200000000000001,11.68, Robert Ashley aka Bobito
11.68,16.080000000000002, aka Max show aka L a aka L otherwise
16.080000000000002,19.92, otherwise known like like
19.92,25.04, anyway do you have another earlier probably I call the judge you don't know
25.04,28.88, are you the attorney to judge you know that that's that's
28.88,32.08, chinese because timely one man chinese whispers
32.08,38.48, say it evidently less cool hey there we have Sean Malloy okay okay hi there
38.48,41.68, so no Jeff are we gonna pretend that Ryan's here the ordinarily we
41.68,44.879999999999995, would have just included this don't award to talk on the podcast that
44.879999999999995,48.879999999999995, went up on when when when since we're recording here on Wednesday
48.879999999999995,52.56, you can go forth six fourth
52.56,56.080000000000005, yes in time Wednesday June fourth lost island screwed up my whole
56.080000000000005,60.480000000000004, sense of of chronology um so
60.480000000000004,64.08, but since that's the barco list for the game today when you're listening to
64.08,67.28, this podcast so we rather make you wait till next week we decided to
67.28,69.28, release it in and talk about it in advance
69.28,72.56, now we can just you know put it online for you along with the interview
72.56,74.88, on the preview so that you can
74.88,78.0, check it out in a timely fashion it's a supplement cool
78.0,81.12, so for this I wanted to thank Hoover where relics studios based
81.12,85.12, and this is of course a sequel to their warhammer forty
85.12,89.28, thousand um themed real time strategy game
89.28,92.64, had the original game did really well had it had a ton of
92.64,95.92, expansions for it and stuff it's also the same studio
95.92,99.44, that produced company heroes which you hear me talking about all the time
99.44,103.36000000000001, so this was my interest in it I'm not like a big warhammer
103.36000000000001,106.80000000000001, you know universe fan or haven't been
106.8,110.72, and but what happened is like I fell in love with company heroes
110.72,113.52, to such an extent that you know I talked about on the podcast week after week
113.52,116.88, played on the nightly basis still continue to do so
116.88,122.0, and it's like okay now I have a point of reference with what the studio does and I'm convinced
122.0,126.16, that they make quality games in this genre so I wanted to see it
126.16,129.44, and I went up there and
129.44,133.68, it's kind of fun looking at it both ways it so my expectations were that as company
133.68,137.44, heroes player I'd see this and and be like okay I'm gonna
137.44,141.20000000000002, I'm gonna understand you know how this game is structured how
141.20000000000002,145.04000000000002, how you know the whole thing is organized and I did and it made me super
145.04000000000002,147.84, interested in that capacity is like okay it doesn't matter the opposite of
147.84,149.84, people who are like I don't want to play company heroes because it's world
149.84,153.20000000000002, or two and I'm in the world or two so it's like well that's natural
153.20000000000002,155.92000000000002, I'm not the person who's like I don't want to play don't work as it's warhammer
155.92000000000002,159.68, but I'm kind of like well warhammer like proved to me why that's cool right
159.68,163.6, can I can I ask a stupid question what even is warhammer I have no idea
164.32,168.48000000000002, like what is the theme of it is it like British competency like yeah a British
168.48000000000002,171.76000000000002, company called games workshop produced this this is like in the post
172.64000000000001,176.4, Gary Guygeck's Dungeons & Dragons world a tabletop fantasy game that
178.16,181.84, had most of the same themes is Dungeons & Dragons but actually uses
182.96,187.68, miniature environments and and lead figurines that people will often paint
188.16,192.32, and so those will represent their whole armies and stuff and so again instead of you
192.32,196.4, know and well I mean I guess it's not a fair comparison again it's Dungeons and Dragons
196.4,200.4, you play a single role this you command an entire army or something so
201.20000000000002,204.08, it's kind of like in RTS with with miniatures you know and
204.08,207.84, turn based stuff so you'd say like I have a bunch of you know riflemen here
207.84,211.28, guys with bolt throwers I'm gonna move them forward and well roll the die and see how
211.28,215.52, they fare against this group of orcs with flamethrowers very complicated
215.60000000000002,220.16, hobby board game basically yeah now well now that you say that I think I I know a girl in DC
220.16,226.24, who was obsessively into painting those things had a glass case full of them plus you know
226.24,231.60000000000002, various dragons yeah right and the different dragons so the different to warhammer and
231.60000000000002,234.72, warhammer 40k is warhammer is the more traditional like tokenesque
234.72,242.16000000000003, okay elves and medieval kind of stuff and then 40k takes a lot of those medieval kind of fantasy
242.24,248.4, or elements and throws in a base armor oh man those are like we're continuing
248.4,253.68, video game works in space and sci-fi like where does it fall there is the the walls
253.68,258.88, or theory okay ten like the final fantasy games did right I mean the original final
258.88,263.52, fantasies were more or less traditional yeah they were a little more grounded in terms of
263.52,269.04, like fantasy and then later they got crazy with the sci-fi elements technology came in so
269.04,275.44, they're still magic so like there's a race called the Eldar in those are the equivalent of space
275.44,280.56, elves don't have like the sorts of same attributes you dissociate with elves they're they're good
280.56,285.36, at distance combat they're quick and that sort of thing Robert's laughing at this one search for
285.36,291.28000000000003, this one come on I had it was part of my research okay I believe yeah that's the bad one space
291.28000000000003,296.56, elves so what does it say about this game out so for my point of view as a company here is fan
297.04,301.92, all the expectations I just outlined it absolutely nailed it I looked at it and said wow I cannot
301.92,306.24, wait to play this game we have Ryan Scott that's who's about to join us here this is a
306.24,314.48, science god coming through the door but you're hit it on Ryan we're talking about Don of War
314.48,317.92, and a special segment one of the so whatever you want about him's three bits of headphones
320.32,326.4, hello hello hi Ryan hello and welcome to GFW radio you're in Jeff special segment special
326.4,331.2, segment we're taping that next man this is most of the more or less a straight up dot award
331.2,336.96, discussion to supplement a feature but it's already turned into mini GFWs that's right forget
336.96,343.28, actually anything that's good okay so I was explaining uh beat around the bush working up to my
343.28,349.52, impressions of you know seeing Don of War II I didn't actually get to play it but um here here's
349.52,353.76, the main thrust of it they have three main things that they wanted to address and one is that in
353.76,360.08, traditional RTS games a lot of people say that they they feel disconnected to their units that
360.08,363.44, they feel like you know they're pushing army men around on the board and this was some of the same
363.44,367.52, you know thought process that governed their creation of company heroes like we don't want these
367.52,373.03999999999996, to be toy soldiers we want these to at least to seem life like in that they're if a mortar goes off
373.03999999999996,377.59999999999997, near them they're gonna die for cover they're gonna go um they're gonna fire back when you know
377.59999999999997,380.56, when someone's firing at them you're gonna see them reload you're gonna hear them scream and
380.56,384.88, actually get shot the things that we're used to seeing in a first person you know shoot or
384.88,388.88, something like that or any other you know even third person action games but just traditionally
388.88,394.72, not in a really static RTS space so that was the step part of the the way that they answered this
394.72,401.36, with company heroes is animation and audio and all of this and now they want to take it to step further
401.36,406.24, and more of this drastically reduce the number of units you're controlling at any time
406.32,412.64, so rather filling overwhelmed building a base here controlling an army of this type of units maybe
412.64,416.96000000000004, it's mixed over here fighting on another front at the same time and trying to manage all of this
416.96000000000004,423.52, and then at the same time go in zoom in at any given spot and give specific orders to one unit or
423.52,428.40000000000003, something which is called microing this micro management in the RTS space and it's usually a dirty
428.40000000000003,432.56, word it's looked as like it's the last thing you want to do but it's also what separates good
432.56,438.88, players from bad so for example in starcraft they're really good players they combine these two
438.88,444.4, modes of thinking strategy and tactics it seamlessly into one so you might not you know they they'd
444.4,448.32, have to vocalize what they're actually doing otherwise you wouldn't understand I'm kind of talking
448.32,452.24, Robert here because you watched me play company here as a minute and you seem to be like perplexed
452.24,456.4, by what the fuck was happening and what I was doing this so they would be saying
457.35999999999996,463.03999999999996, in ten minutes from now I need to have this type of weapon to counter the inevitable the inevitable
463.03999999999996,467.91999999999996, fact that they're going to to put bring this kind of unit against me if I don't have it I'm I'm going to be
467.91999999999996,471.84, screwed so they're going to be working that out but then maybe there's a fight over here and they're like
471.84,476.23999999999995, I can dodge these guys attacks by moving this unit around but every second you spend
476.23999999999995,480.32, didling with that one unit is one that you're sacrificing bigger broader strokes you know
480.32,484.88, yeah one of your pinchers or your pinch movements falling behind any of these things so to me it's like
484.88,489.44, watching a movie by flipping the channels you know you're like making your own little movie have
489.44,493.76, you've written that sentence TV and just watch TV and just flip the channels and just see what happens
493.76,498.0, if you just consider it all one thing you know like you don't hear all the different species like
498.0,504.48, come on down to Pontiac I love you you know I have never been a big sister you've
504.48,510.15999999999997, used for chance or you better there if you make it my movie I am I mean but it's sort of like
510.15999999999997,513.28, I mean you're just sort of flipping around and all this crazy shit happening when I was
513.28,518.0799999999999, watching you play that game though I think like I just wondered you know what someone who's like 80 years old
518.0799999999999,522.8, would think right I don't think it was just in less than you possibly have to release and stand to a
522.8,528.72, life of like war gaming yeah even in the oldest type of war games around they would you know and even
528.72,533.1999999999999, when you see you know these all in all the movies you see generals pushing Napoleon pushing this
533.1999999999999,537.92, little lead figures around with a stick I think they did grasp that but in this case it's that the
537.92,542.3199999999999, lead figure would also be something to worry about too instead of worrying about the fact that these
542.4000000000001,546.32, troops are over here and that they're provisioned well armed you also have to worry about what
546.32,550.1600000000001, this specific guy is doing at this specific moment and that's the weird thing so it's like
550.1600000000001,554.96, the channel serving or just like having a macrocosmic and a microcosmic view at the same time
554.96,560.48, so what really wants to do with Don award or two is really take that out so it's a more manageable
560.48,566.72, five squads that you're controlling at any time which brings it in a way closer to something like
566.72,571.5200000000001, brother's norms where you got two squads in yourself where you kind of act like this go between
571.6,576.88, form and that frees you up from having you're not building bases you're not collecting resources
576.88,581.04, you're not worrying about any of these other religious things you're just focusing on the tactics
581.04,586.3199999999999, of these units so say for example you have a bunch of guys with with long range rifles are
586.3199999999999,590.0, automatic rifles and they're perfect for suppressing other units if they come at you directly in
590.0,594.88, your behind fire you like them up and they're going to be either stuck crawling around on the ground
594.88,598.72, or have to get to cover it instead they're in weight if they're exchanging fire then you might
598.8000000000001,602.32, say bring up your another squad that's got grenades and flamethrowers and then you could flush
602.32,605.84, them out of their cover with that even like if you brought another rifle squad you might not be able
605.84,611.0400000000001, to do much because they're they're hidden so then you you multiply that on a level five where you
611.0400000000001,616.08, can either have five squads and the addition of other units you know big heroic things like
616.08,621.36, like they called it was a juggernaut dread not I think it's a juggernaut I'm looking to someone
621.36,626.4, hopefully the juggernaut more hammer better than one or hammer better not and I looked that up
626.9599999999999,630.24, the way that works is I guess like one of the space Marines which are kind of like the equivalent
630.24,635.1999999999999," of the humans in the war hammer 40,000 universe one of those dies they'll like sort of put their"
635.1999999999999,642.64, ghost in the shell of this this mech warrior type thing and then they'll they'll they'll
642.64,648.9599999999999, move on Robert like that so wait a minute back up a bit how how are you deciding
649.76,655.12, what units you have do you get to pick it or is it like your delta hand of 10 and you pick five
655.12,658.8, or something and you just drop them in wherever since there's no right resources are base building
658.8,663.92, so let me specify first that we're talking about just the campaign here it gets safe to divide these two
663.92,668.64, because they haven't showed the multiplayer and I have no idea I'm guessing it will involve some
668.64,673.68, rudimentary structures and management you know maybe like company here as does right because what you're
673.68,680.0, describing so far sounds kind of like myth you familiar with the bungee game where I it was a real
680.56,685.2, tactics game it didn't have the base building that like a warcraft or like a command and
685.2,689.52, pocket it was kind of like you are given a certain amount of units you dropped them on the battlefield
689.52,694.48, and you go hmm is that kind of it seems like that's the deal yeah with with the flexibility that
694.48,699.68, like maybe for subsequent missions I'm sure for the first ones they will determine in advance
699.68,703.6, what what you're gonna field and in that way they're able to teach you how to use them like I was
703.6,706.8, saying this is a unit's good for suppression this is one that's good for flanking this is one
706.8,713.4399999999999, it's good for hand-to-hand combat this one's good for mobility and then later on what happens is
713.4399999999999,718.9599999999999, that you can choose the specific squads that you're going to field and then not only that you can
718.9599999999999,723.12, you can manipulate their loadouts and stuff so here's the other thing they want to address the
724.16,727.28, I want to get through this this is their point by point thing you might have you'll see this
727.28,730.4, in a lot of the previews because we're going to talk about right now it's their presentation so
730.4,733.92, when I try to do an interview and I'll give you my impressions afterwards go beyond that but
734.0,738.0799999999999, to get through this really quick then is that there's no persistence or permanence in a lot of
738.0799999999999,742.7199999999999, RTS play what will happen is you do one campaign mission you build up this base you build up
742.7199999999999,746.56, you start with just some p-ons you work your way toward this massive army annihilate the enemy
746.9599999999999,750.7199999999999, then you hit a load screen and you do it all over again you start with those same p-ons you build
750.7199999999999,757.28, the bases once again so by dumping that you know that's one solution the other is that to to keep
757.28,762.0, you playing with the usual carrot that every game of almost every genre is turning to more and more
762.64,767.04, you know we're called duty four we'll let you unlock weapons balfaith here let's you get things
767.04,771.68, you know balfaith by company which I just reviewed is got it's system you know it's selection of
772.32,777.92, of equipment gadgets and weapons that you unlock so here similarly you get different armor and guns
779.36,783.52, color schemes banners and all these things that you outfit your squads with and that will actually
783.52,788.08, change you know their capabilities and stuff so before you go in you can change their loadouts and
788.32,792.4000000000001, I'm going to put this kind of you here or I'm going to get the best armor to the
792.4000000000001,797.76, to the flankers that are also hand-to-hand specialist that use chains swords that's for you to laugh at
797.76,804.1600000000001, Robert oh what's it funny about a chain sword it's just something for you to laugh at it
805.84,810.32, is that like a chainsaw and a sword is that it's a yeah it's a sort of the chainsaw so if you think of a
810.4000000000001,818.96, lightsaber it's just like it's a chainsaw lightsaber okay um so you're still going out of equipment to your
818.96,825.0400000000001, dudes yeah and then from there they say that you know there's there's meaning in persistence to the campaign so
825.0400000000001,831.2, that they want you to under each squad leader of one of these five squad you have it's got his own
831.2,835.2, voice actors is on characteristics and they try to invent you know create some personality to go
835.2,840.08, with it so you feel like if these guys die or they're pinnors something you again you get over the
840.08,845.12, whole I'm the general these are my like plastic figurines I'm pushing across a board who the
845.12,849.6800000000001, hell cares if 10 die here as long as I take this territory in the long run where you're more invested
849.6800000000001,856.24, in their survival and stuff and that all seems really cool um in action it's really cool I mean that
856.24,860.64, that's the thing that that translates so well is that you know when you're zooming in or even you know
860.64,865.44, at the standard camera that you're in you never really have to go across this giant map and worry
865.5200000000001,870.0, about a ton of stuff in the campaign I mean you can you might move about a half screen and any given
870.0,874.0, direction up down left right or something and you still have your stuff going so that means you're
874.0,878.48, you're relatively close or to it and they'll come in and do you know if they change saw someone it's
878.48,883.2, very much like you know gears a whore something where you you know it's all animated it all works
883.2,887.9200000000001, out and the way the grenades fly and set people on fire and the way that you know trace her fire
887.92,895.12, is going off and and ricochet buildings blowing up um they have like a one section I saw was
895.12,899.28, was super cool on just the tech side but it but it matters in this kind of game because part of the
899.28,902.64, fun if a company here is this you know when all their tiller is going off and stuff and you're seeing
903.36,907.04, the earth flying and the buildings coming down I mean there's there's something to be said for that
907.04,911.4399999999999, and here they'll have things like an orbital laser where you know there was like 40 of these
911.4399999999999,916.64, orcs on screen you know charging your your Marines and then all of a sudden you know the ground
916.8,920.64, lights up around them and then they're lifted off the ground and suspended without gravity for a
920.64,924.3199999999999, second and then the orbital laser comes down and just blows them away and then it sends like all
924.3199999999999,929.12, 40 of them you know ragged on across the environment and if they hit you know if they hit a tree
929.12,934.08, or what not a tree in this world but if they hit you know some some you know call them or something
934.08,938.96, like that they can knock that over and that looked really cool the bigger units start fighting
938.96,942.88, and they do hand-to-hand you know they they showed one of the squad commanders they call the force
942.96,949.6, commander jumping on like this orc warboss beat him with this warhammer over the head
949.6,953.92, knocking them all around and that looked really cool so as a company here is player where
954.72,960.96, the things that matter most they're suppression and cover you you're now adding the
960.96,966.08, significant melee thing and originally they had planned for this to be part of company here it was
966.08,970.08, not would have been cool I mean the whole notion of fixing bayonets is other elemental play so that
970.1600000000001,973.9200000000001, if you have guys that are entrenched or something and they're shooting if you're able to flank
973.9200000000001,979.2, and you just jump down and their trenches and you know fix your bayonets and stab them to death and now
979.2,984.96, they've got all that going in this game I think that adds a lot so to go back from the other
984.96,988.64, point of view I was like well what about if you're just a don't war player you skip company here
988.64,994.32, is because you're not in a world or two themes and whatnot then I think that people's minds are
994.32,998.32, probably going to be really blown because the game is so much closer to company here is in the original
998.32,1005.2800000000001, Don't War as far as I can tell all the leaps that were there and company here is we'll just
1005.2800000000001,1010.24, be brand new to them so it's like not only am I getting these cool effects I'm talking about with
1010.24,1016.8000000000001, orbital lasers and stuff but just the audio the you know the the animation and all that the audio
1016.8000000000001,1022.6400000000001, stuff I talk about is cool because it it's not so specific that an enemy will recognize that you
1022.6400000000001,1026.8, load out fitted your squad with this kind of weapon and we'll respond and we'll talk about that
1026.96,1032.8799999999999, but it's context sensitive in the way that they're that they're AI audio works I mean their audio
1032.8799999999999,1037.04, AI works is that like say for example if you're crossing a bridge or something and it's been
1037.04,1041.36, mind one of your guys might kind of hesitate and say like I don't know you know let's should
1041.36,1045.12, we really cross this or should we send the guys with the jet packs over so the bridge does blow up
1045.12,1049.12, they can at least boost off of it or something and it'll kill into that kind of stuff and
1049.12,1053.52, it works so well company here isn't it actually matters here normally I wouldn't even think about
1053.6,1058.16, talking about audio in RTS because I think about like I mean you get well Sean you played a
1058.16,1062.6399999999999, time you know like I talked about universe at war before and I played that the audio it's like
1062.6399999999999,1066.24, it just kills it for me you click on a unit says the same dumb line every time
1067.28,1071.44, right yeah I mean that's kind of an old tradition is you click on it and let's get it's
1072.4,1077.04, a litany of different lines that it says right or the same line or the same line yeah
1077.04,1082.6399999999999, yeah depending on the game the combination of things coming together that the script is good
1082.96,1087.76, that the performer who's reading the lines is competent and then also that the audio AI is
1087.76,1092.0800000000002, putting the splicing these in at the appropriate times other than just when you click on a unit and
1092.0800000000002,1097.76, that goes back to you know warcraft and the ready master I'm not ready huh click on the click on
1097.76,1102.5600000000002, the over so I mean it sounds like it's getting just closer and closer to that sort of a childhood
1102.5600000000002,1108.96, fantasy of of you know toy soldiers and battles that you'd have in your head you know out
1108.96,1113.2, in the backyard and the things that you would imagine happening that weren't actually happening
1113.2,1118.8, that you've got these huge battle scenes where lots of crazy stuff is happening and it's still
1118.8,1124.4, a game but but that it's just a lot more like physical visceral yeah totally yeah it absolutely
1124.4,1128.8, is I mean in the sense that like if you know when you looked at the first watch star wars and they
1128.8,1133.28, had the the 3D hologram chest thing you're looking at it and you're like that kind of like
1133.28,1137.8400000000001, was a look into the future for games like tech and in Soul Calber take aside the chest component
1137.9199999999998,1141.1999999999998, you're like whoa what if they were just like 3D muscle man they could beat on each other
1141.76,1144.8, and you got that and this is kind of like the version where you're like yeah start with
1144.8,1149.4399999999998, I have played for the army stuff and then now I get all of that going and that's the cool thing
1149.4399999999998,1154.24, because in like an FPS or something their hands are tied to the extent that you're just controlling
1154.24,1159.84, one character or getting very rudimentary orders to to squad mates or something a lot of games
1159.84,1163.76, don't even really want you to do that outside of like brothers and arms and rainbow six and stuff
1164.16,1168.32, and so when you do have battle and that's kind of like the thing with games that genre like
1168.32,1172.64, like years of war too they're like now it's war I mean you hear that a lot like before it was just
1172.64,1176.56, these skirmishes these battles now we want to show war but when they go to resolve that and it's
1176.56,1182.56, no fault of their own what it often boils down to is having a bunch of scripted stuff happening
1182.56,1186.8, around you and the background has no bearing on what you're doing and this is the kind of game where
1187.6,1190.8, if you're interested in RTS but you're like you don't really get it I'm trying to give you
1190.8,1195.84, reasons for liking it you know it's like yeah this is it is the entire war but you are in control of
1195.84,1201.76, it you know in the whole thing matters in the way that you're organizing it um so I mean to wrap it up on
1201.76,1209.44, this I I was really really impressed I can't wait to play it I'm you know um again this is I be
1209.44,1213.28, just about every bit of excitement I've had for company here is you know over the past you know
1213.28,1217.52, you've got years something like seems like it's perfectly going to translate into this game
1218.24,1223.52, so they're still showing you the single player campaign you said right so did they just show you like
1223.52,1227.12, one faction or do we know how many factions are there gonna be and are you gonna have a show
1227.12,1231.52, branches yeah they showed the space Marines we know offhand that they're gonna be to the orcs
1231.52,1236.32, in the space Marines they didn't show the orcs other than as an opponent and they seemingly fight
1236.32,1240.8799999999999, differently and I don't know if that'll that'll be that way for for their single player campaign as well
1240.8799999999999,1247.04, because they're just a lot of times they had numerical superiority but they just had less efficient forces
1247.12,1251.12, to go up against a few more Marines which are kind of like the navy I mean the space Marines which
1251.12,1255.28, like navy seal or something like that you know right yeah and there to get the job done so I don't
1255.28,1260.0, know how the resolve that they're also kind of like beating around the bush about other I mean right now
1260.0,1266.0, it company here has came out with two armies just as many games come out with three right so they keep
1266.0,1272.24, joking around there's this this group called the tyrannids in in war hammer 40k lore and I kind of I
1272.24,1276.96, don't know already different groups that I'm getting from them my they haven't said it but my just
1276.96,1283.28, cold reading on what they're saying says that they they're probably gonna be in it again that's me speculating
1283.28,1287.52, this isn't right well they've been by Solstorm the third third expansion for Donnawar one they're
1287.52,1291.84, up to nine or something and I think you know there's a bridge that I didn't need to draw on I haven't
1291.84,1296.4, even played them so again like but it seems ridiculous but you have to be a good speaker to that just
1296.4,1301.2, because I mean like how do you it's so difficult to balance these games for multiplayer is what I'm
1301.2,1305.52, thinking of campaign right yeah that's no problem at all but like when you're having a multiplayer game
1306.0800000000002,1310.24, and say you have an eight player game going and everyone is a different army you have to worry about how
1310.24,1315.04, you're combining these two and like whether or not you're getting like overpowered you know
1315.04,1320.0800000000002, combinations that you hadn't even anticipated what happens when sure this army's got this unit
1320.0800000000002,1324.16, and it's powerful in this context but then it's limited by the fact that the army lacks other units
1324.16,1329.68, but then when they overlap with other combinations and they're like oh you have no weakness now you know
1329.76,1336.0, it turns into like rock paper scissors would fire yeah uh exactly like water whatever
1336.0,1340.88, assume there's some degree of a giving up on balance at that point right okay well there's
1340.88,1346.88, some balance and some parts but I want to play the the RTS where it has no strategy at all it's just like
1347.44,1353.28, you have a headset on and whoever can yell at their army best or like loudest wins
1353.28,1358.72, you're just like injured the girl girl girl girl girl girl girl and they just make a good
1358.72,1363.68, part of the game by Ubisoft kid could have some of that because maybe this is a
1363.68,1369.12, guess it's controlled by you know voice input yeah like whoever is more palpably angry wins
1369.12,1373.12, like maybe they should have like something that reads your heart rate something like
1373.12,1376.8799999999999, it would be hard because you know like when you play these games in bed like it's just us
1376.8799999999999,1382.72, screaming units and just fucking blowing our gas gets kind of like I guess the career squad leader would
1382.72,1388.32, know yeah trying to tell people to stop doing something you think is not conducive to the survival
1388.32,1395.52, you know and cursing a blue streak uh she always thinks about about to give you they they want
1395.52,1400.48, to they keep saying that like you know every decision you make the order that you tackle missions
1400.48,1405.6000000000001, and so you'll you'll be looking at uh solar system or something with different planets and you
1405.6000000000001,1409.52, can jump and respond a different distress calls and go to these different missions they they
1409.6,1414.48, they're trying to say that how you fight in each of these and is going to influence what happens
1414.48,1420.6399999999999, later and that the games total outcome this will have were reflect you know you're the order
1420.6399999999999,1425.04, of your progress and stuff and I want to ask if if if I'm a hundred different endings like follow
1425.04,1430.56, three or like the skeptical you know thing would be like what do you mean that you just pick up
1430.56,1435.04, different you unlock different weapons right it could be along and they're saying no it's not that
1435.12,1441.52, but they're not they're not saying how right so it's kind of like well until they say how it's
1441.52,1446.56, not even really worth to me it's it's just a claim you know yeah and and we'll see what they do about
1446.56,1456.48, that um any other questions hmm then for fun at all we're hammering curious craft there's
1456.48,1461.44, there's somebody listening right now it's like go on but what about the yeah I mean yeah just not
1461.44,1466.48, here as as the war hammer player Ryan played you're being really quiet since you played on a war
1467.1200000000001,1472.16, oh yeah I'm just being really quiet because I like walked in midway that's fine man talk
1472.16,1477.04, but you you should have the questions right what would you want to know had you gone up there
1477.04,1484.3200000000002, and I might have answers for you um can you play as the space marines all right thanks for
1484.48,1489.04, right well no I I think you probably you probably kind of talked about all the stuff and I'm curious about
1489.04,1496.24, sort of like where it kind of evolved from company of heroes since that was that itself was an
1496.24,1503.2, evolution of Donna-Bore and I assume this is gonna be uh the next big thing that you know we'll take
1503.2,1508.6399999999999, people like you away from company of heroes right I'm hoping I'm sure will yeah different in
1508.64,1514.24, that way it's like no base building and stuff like that sounds like some people will not want to move
1514.24,1520.24, to that just right but again you don't know about multiplayer yeah yeah I can get tricky because
1520.24,1523.3600000000001, I don't I mean yeah like if if you just describe right now and you're like oh yeah about
1523.3600000000001,1527.1200000000001, the player you should pick five squads and you go go to war like okay I'll stick with company
1527.1200000000001,1531.76, heroes yeah until until I play and I'm true but I'm really interesting that they that's going to
1531.76,1535.5200000000002, be the case and I'll talk about multiplayer at all first because that seems like such the like
1535.6,1541.84, a draw or this you think so I what I get from from talking to them is that probably more people play
1541.84,1547.28, if it's not a 50 50 split probably probably more people play the campaigns on these games
1547.28,1552.16, I personally I always play the campaigns and barely touch multiplayer unless I have a very
1552.16,1557.92, specific friend of group right and the exact I have I have loaded up company of heroes like
1557.92,1564.32, nearly every other week once and can try to play out I'll play like one mission in the campaign and be like
1565.52,1569.36, okay I'm gonna go play something else the campaign's gonna be pretty good I keep trying to like
1569.36,1574.08, make myself learn that game but and I've even like downloaded videos and stuff and like I've got
1574.08,1580.72, figured this game out and I just get bored and start playing Pac Man this is a real problem with this
1580.72,1585.28, kind of game right I mean I'm with you and that like it is you know right now I can
1585.28,1589.36, unequivocally say that coming here is my favorite game you know of this past you know year
1590.08,1595.12, and I haven't finished the campaign on it or opposing fronts yeah I play I like the
1595.12,1599.12, multiplayer the strike but how do you figure out like a SoulColour player so stuff like how
1599.12,1602.8, do you figure out the multiplayer stuff without doing the campaign by jumping in what I was
1602.8,1607.1999999999998, just about to recommend to you is that you get a teacher you got to get a battle buddy get a band of
1607.1999999999998,1612.3999999999999, life so so we can go in and we can play against the computer set to easy at first yeah and you
1612.3999999999999,1618.2399999999998, just learn there because there is like it's kind of troubling that the correlation between the
1618.2399999999998,1624.32, way that you handle single player multiplayer is nowhere near strong as I think it could be at
1624.32,1629.04, least if you're goalist a condition people to move to graduate to multiplayer yeah but maybe
1629.04,1632.24, some people don't I mean it's kind of the same maybe they're like well a lot of people just
1632.24,1635.2, aren't interested multiplayer but maybe they're not interested because they're having the
1635.2,1639.12, experience you are in single player and they're assuming like well if I can't beat the first
1639.12,1644.48, couple missions a campaign or and feel competent about at least when I do beat it yeah like
1644.48,1648.24, I thought if I go online I'm gonna get screwed you know I haven't really had trouble beating the
1648.24,1653.6799999999998, campaign stuff I've done it just to found it really boring yeah yeah I mean because they don't it's
1653.68,1658.0800000000002, not nearly the amount of options that are available to you in the multiplayer they usually ramp it
1658.0800000000002,1663.04, up slowly like the last mission in a typical single player campaign that's where you would get
1663.04,1666.72, almost everything you would have in the multiplayer and sometimes not yeah the full the full
1666.72,1670.64, I mean it was feeling to me like an extension of the tutorial which was another thing that I did
1670.64,1674.4, that was really funny to me I mean it took like an hour and a half to get through the tutorial
1674.4,1679.04, because you wanted to like catch everything yeah it will and I just slowly played through
1679.04,1682.48, everything I listened to every I mean the tutorial was literally just that long and I remember
1682.48,1687.3600000000001, my wife's there was hanging out on the couch reading and just like every 20 minutes be like is this
1687.3600000000001,1692.72, over yet what are you doing like seriously go into multiplayer with with like me or someone
1692.72,1699.28, but yeah yeah I'm confident that you'll see the difference and be like okay wow this is
1699.28,1704.48, yeah it's so damn cool I really want to get into it here things that they'll probably learn from
1704.48,1711.3600000000001, those one to make missions shorter you know in campaigns because yeah they can they they can be
1711.9199999999998,1715.6, they last forever they might take you like an hour just to do one and then what happens when you're
1715.6,1719.9199999999998, done you just do it all over again so I mean these are some of the things that they're trying to work on
1719.9199999999998,1723.84, and then the other thing is like you know when I'm saying that they're fewer units to deal with
1723.84,1728.24, the good side is that they're more options for these units instead of like just saying I can make
1728.24,1733.04, a move here I can make them shoot then you really can focus on the micro on the micro doesn't
1733.04,1736.9599999999998, really feel like micro on the negative sense with starcraft or something because you don't have the
1736.96,1741.2, big picture to worry about I mean you actually want these options are sort of empowering and they
1741.2,1746.16, make you feel like kind of like you know like when we have like good tank battles and in company
1746.16,1751.52, here is online we will say I charge in with tanks and I'll come in at different angles that way
1751.52,1755.8400000000001, and the reason I'll do that is because if if they happen to have an AT gun camouflage somewhere
1755.8400000000001,1759.44, and it starts firing on one chances are it's not going to be able it's going to have to
1759.44,1764.48, do it about face to hit the other then I can pull that tank behind it and attack it or conversely
1765.04,1769.1200000000001, if it's hitting me so hard with like arm repersoned shells instead of just clicking we'll go back
1769.1200000000001,1773.3600000000001, here to my base and I'll cross my fingers that it gets back to a repair station before it gets
1773.3600000000001,1778.48, blown up instead of just doing that all all order it in small increments to back up never
1778.48,1783.76, expose it's it's rear to the to the AT fire you know and then I'll move that back and then as soon
1783.76,1788.0, as it turns around to attack the tank that's then behind it then I can crouch then I can like
1788.0,1791.68, inch it back in and take it out that way and so those kind of things are like really fun I mean
1791.68,1795.3600000000001, it might not sound I don't know if this sounds like even remotely interesting or fun to you
1795.3600000000001,1799.44, but it's like I find that like really rewarding when you especially gets good opponents and you're like
1799.44,1804.48, the game always sounds like a just a huge collection of like interesting moments that if you know what you're
