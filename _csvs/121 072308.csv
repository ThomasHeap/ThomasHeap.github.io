34.84,39.08," We got special guests here this week. You heard his his uh,"

57.559999999999995,61.08, things we did like kind of all day you guys love. So you're kind of a big shed.
62.04,70.6, We're now. We'll take you down a few pegs. I think you will. If the pre-chatter is anything to go
70.6,75.4, by I'm in for a rough ride. It's just a secret right about DC combat the status of DC

88.68,95.4, luck and it's really kind of creepy. There. Okay. So you're leaving it. That's right. We have a hard
95.4,100.92, stop today. We're going to podcast for like a little over an hour because I'm going to see
101.48,107.16, Dark Knight. So there. I'm admitting it. That's a good reason. I'm leaving midday to go see the
107.16,113.64," Batman movie. Well, it's not midday. Yeah. Late. Okay. It's a midday. Right. Have you seen yet Ryan?"
113.64,121.72, Hell yes. Yeah. I saw it opening night. Day one. Yeah. Did you take your fiance? Uh-huh. She liked it as much
121.72,127.24000000000001, as you. She was yeah. She's. Did she lead a go or yeah. Oh yeah. She's is big of the geek as I am.
127.64,133.0, Yeah. Or is she just pretending that? No. She's because she comes from a family of nerd who played
133.0,138.28, D&D and wow. Love Lord of the Rings and have. Okay. Postures of Middle Earth on their walls.
138.28,143.72, So she's not human. No. She's she's into it. Is there Joker cosplaying your future this year?
143.72,148.92," I do not believe so. Okay. Well, you never know. She could want to dress you up."
149.95999999999998,154.6, She tried to dress you up as Dr. Who. And she did dress you up as Dr. Who. She did not.
155.4,161.96, That was half my idea. That's her. But yet she did do it. I want to. I did it. It's for like a
161.96,167.0, you guys off from talk about bedroom and take. Yeah. I don't want to know. Yeah. It's like a scene and
167.0,172.68, track that kind of something. Oh okay. Oh my god. So now I look like the sick one.
174.04,178.68, Was it your mind gosh. There's the scene in track. He's with a couple run Star Trek dental.
178.68,183.48, You see that rod now. They run a dentist's office and the theme is Star Trek and they take
183.56,187.39999999999998," turns dressing up and then when they're when the interview, you know, asking them, you know,"
187.39999999999998,192.44, who dresses as who it turns out that the guy dresses as I don't remember the psychic chick from
192.44,199.48, next generation. I don't remember naming them. The wife dresses up as data. And it kind of was
199.48,203.48," it just went from this normal discussion about like, oh look at there's phasers on the walls"
203.48,209.0, and all this stuff and it ended up in their bedroom within. That's where we're going with Ryan's.
209.08,214.84, I can see that. This is all for conventions. Deanna Troy. I remember it. Yeah.
217.0,220.92," Hi, I love boring life. So before we start the thing I was bitching about about the"
220.92,226.6," man, it's just I mean, I don't know. It could just be auntie hype or whatever, but I mean,"
226.6,230.76," I'm so any time you go online anywhere, like I was posting some pictures and I was using like"
231.64,235.48," tiny pick or whatever, you know, some image hosting service and they have like the sample"
235.56,239.79999999999998, popular picks and they're always of like the Joker or something. They look like they're just designed
239.79999999999998,244.67999999999998," for a cell phone wallpaper and stuff. And it reminds me of, you know, like when the crow came out"
245.16,249.39999999999998, and it's just like the saddest element in high school throughout the country and um and like the
249.39999999999998,255.07999999999998, taste makers at a hot topic. It's like that store in the mall that sells you like a jackskelling
255.07999999999998,259.4," since weather or something tells you your punk rock for it. Like, yeah, I don't know man, it's just"
259.4,262.92, designed for that. And then there's the other additional thing. I think anytime there's someone who plays
263.8,269.16," a psychopathic character well, it gets a little more like attention than it deserves. Like, you know,"
269.16,274.12," my mind like Matthew, Matthew, Moody and his performance was superior to whoever played private pile"
274.12,278.92," in full metal jacket, but it's like because the crazy character stands out. I mean, you think"
278.92,281.96000000000004," it is all the time too. I mean, sure, Nick will soon in the shining and these are all great"
281.96000000000004,286.36," performances, but it's like people just really latch on to it. Wow. Like, it's like, you know, it's like"
286.36,291.32," played the retarded character or the autistic one or, you know, Sean Penn and his right play rain"
291.32,295.71999999999997, man and get an off there. That kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. So maybe it's great. I just
295.71999999999997,301.15999999999997," I mean, it's totally hard to know. It's impossible to know what helps this reaction would be if"
301.15999999999997,306.2," Heath Ledger hadn't died, right? And if we'd be going through the same thing, high-poise at"
306.2,311.48," where I now. Like, Brandon Lee and the crew. Right. It's exactly like that. Yeah. And also too"
311.48,315.48," seeing that something about, I mean, I know it's comic books, but when I see a trailer,"
315.48,319.48," I see a millionaire in Halloween costume right in the motorcycle with like, sheen guns and"
319.48,324.12," rockets on the front. That's just silly to me. I mean, I know you're bashing Batman in general."
324.12,328.6," No, but I don't even know. I did like Frank Miller and Matt Dave, Matt's cellys year one."
328.6,331.72," I think that's what like, you know, Batman was dressing up. This Bruce, when he was dressing up"
331.72,336.68," his anything, it was like his like a bomb or something with a shopping cart downtown. And I mean,"
336.68,340.28000000000003," they brought in some things. Some of the, you know, the bad accouture man's at some point in there,"
340.28000000000003,346.36, but it was just toned down enough where I have to go spy in that motorcycle. Yeah. I haven't seen
346.92,355.0, and the trailer does worry me just because Batman begins. I love so much because it was so
355.0,359.64," not about that, about all the gadgets and just the special effects. Like it was so low key in"
359.64,365.96000000000004," in terms of that. Like you didn't even see, you know, the shit on his utility belt or even the"
365.96000000000004,371.72," Batman persona until like a good, you know, 90 minutes into this movie, whereas the TV commercial"
371.8,377.56," in the trailer online is just all about the explosions and the, and the motorcycle, but I don't"
377.56,380.84000000000003," know, maybe that's how they make the movies start. That's how they make commercials. I don't know."
380.84000000000003,384.12," The movie started, well, look, talk about people playing crazy here. It's a Jack Nicholson is the"
384.12,389.56, Joker in Burton's Batman. It's great. But then that series went down the line where's increasingly
389.56,394.52000000000004," just for like, Yucks and toys. So like the last one, she'll make her whatever. It had like,"
394.52000000000004,399.0," every yet, have like every character and vehicle and thing in the Batman universe and so is like,"
399.0,402.6, is this going that direction? It's really hard to believe. This is knowing what to do that.
402.6,410.28," This movie is similar to Batman begins in that way. You know, I mean, there's a bit more James"
410.28,416.84," Bond type stuff, you know, but it's not, I heard there's a lot less Christian bail or a lot less of"
416.84,422.68," him, you know, brood acting broodily. It's like, it's more about the Joker than it was about Batman."
422.68,427.32, It's about the Joker and it's about Harvey Dent. I'm still really impressed how the film industry
427.32,433.4," can turn on that level of public awareness. I mean, I guess I'm in in human machine who believes"
433.4,437.96," in marketing, but I'm like, wow, how did they get that buzz going? I know, I agree with you."
437.96,442.92," I mean, films just, they snap their fingers on the front page coverage on CNN."
442.92,447.4," Yeah, it's weird how it happened with this movie. Because Batman begins, I mean, it got some hype"
447.4,451.64, but not like this. It's like I'll have it on one of the key cast members died during production
452.28,458.12, I guess we get the hype machine. Go. Yeah. But I guess that'd be a good studio strategy.
458.12,463.4, It's kill off on your own. I don't think I'll work for games. I programmed a died.
465.4,469.71999999999997," Have your character, someone lost the code for you'll never be able to put him in a sequel."
469.71999999999997,475.0," You'll never be able to replicate that sim. All right, for a game character."
475.0,477.15999999999997," Yeah, all right. Okay, it won't work."
477.48,485.24, I still have a sealed copy rod of simcopter. That's a good game. Yeah. That had one of the coolest
485.24,489.72, Easter eggs ever. That's why I still haven't sealed. That was for future eBay selling. That was
489.72,493.16," a good game. Legend your wife over here and that. Like if you guys were in the line together,"
493.16,499.72, see Batman. Who is that? Such nuts. It was a sealed copy of simcopter.
501.08000000000004,506.36," But it's cool. Yeah. I actually had that in East Ray. I was like, I, I'll be going to East"
506.36,512.28, 3 or C. S for 18 years. And I'm still like gigland like a school boy when I'm like standing
512.28,515.64, in line to the game. So it gets looking to see some games. I'm going to go in and hold on.
515.64,517.88, Yeah. So which ones were you gigland for this year?
517.88,524.28, This year. I saw a told Jeff with the show. I loved a Valkyrie Chronicles.
524.28,532.52," Sega's PS3 title, which is a, let me get all of the, all of the letters and it's a,"
532.6,537.96, it's a term-based first person shooter with tactical role-playing elements.
538.68,544.4399999999999, It said of course in an alternate world war two where the Japanese characters are saving England.
544.4399999999999,550.36," That's a gigland. So you put that, that's a, I'll be there right. But the game play, I picked"
550.36,555.16," them. I was like, this is awesome. This is really fun. You know, they've got opportunity fires."
555.16,558.76," You're moving around. You can, the, the shooting. When you go to shoot,"
558.76,562.28," everything pulls is for you. So you don't feel stressed. I like that. It's like, it's,"
562.28,566.84," it's my kind of shooter. I remember seeing it at their, at their editor's day, they had a while ago"
566.84,571.3199999999999," and it was really bizarre. I mean, everything you're saying is, and I also remember the art style,"
571.3199999999999,577.88," too, was very cool. Yeah. It's very, 100, 100. Yeah. I guess. Right. Looks like a kind of painted thing."
577.88,583.3199999999999," So yeah. So was that like your game of the show? Conan Quotter. For me, it was. Yeah. I"
583.32,589.0," thought from obviously every ei game, which is of course. But, no, I, I love that. I,"
590.6800000000001,595.6400000000001," what else did I see at the show? Oh, I guess it's Sega's time. Space age, I thought was,"
595.6400000000001,600.5200000000001," oh, I didn't see that over there. Yeah. It was really so much I missed. Yeah. It was good. And the"
600.5200000000001,605.24, indie section on the indie side was really good. Didn't see that either. How did you see all those
605.24,609.8000000000001, stuff? I have to like sitting here. Why did you see more than we did? I just black off. Yeah.
610.12,614.8399999999999," Oh, yeah. There's a, well, because we were assigned to cover certain beats. You know, so"
614.8399999999999,619.0, it just meant not being able to see other things. Like I didn't get to see Sony section.
619.7199999999999,622.4399999999999," There's a bunch of stuff at Ubisoft, but I'd like to see which one allowed in there."
624.28,627.64," There's something. I think there, I heard about a number of different things. I kind of"
627.64,631.9599999999999," shit. Those were that the show, I missed them. I wanted to ask you those. This show, a lot of"
631.9599999999999,636.8399999999999," people were reacting negatively to, you know, like Nintendo's press conference and stuff. And as being"
636.9200000000001,643.88," a so-one who's in charge of a mass market and, you know, none, you know, a franchise that"
643.88,649.0," just gives beyond the typical person that read that updates, it hits at five on one up all during"
649.0,654.6," E3 week. What did you make of, don't you make an Nintendo's press conference? I think Nintendo"
654.6,659.48," can do whatever they want this year. That's, I mean, really. I don't think they've got much"
659.48,667.08," to prove to us. And I think that I liked, I could have done without them telling me just how"
667.08,671.08," well I'd done because I already knew. But I guess it's kind of good news. It's like, okay, you know,"
671.08,675.48," you do really well. I thought we music was exciting. I liked Animal Crossing and, um,"
676.12,681.16," was that kind of odd though watching for anyone else watching the drama guy? Well, not even that."
681.16,685.5600000000001, It was more for when me a model came up because I swear to God as we looked like Uncle Sam drew
685.64,691.4," it in 1942 or something like, then he's up there playing. I got to touch him. I got to touch him."
691.4,696.8399999999999," I see three. First time I've ever met him and I got to touch him. He came to EA's booth and,"
697.4,702.68," um, our general counsel who handles the relationship when Nintendo said, hey, we're going to need"
702.68,708.52," somebody to basically be a go for a cardamom around, you know, if we got some spare exact and I was"
708.52,715.16," gay and so I got to do it. He was awesome. He was just totally like, you know, who are you"
715.16,720.52," little people? But it was very interesting the games he loved, um, not surprising him. He's a platform"
720.52,724.68," designer. He's been a lot of time on mirroreds edge. Like how do you make a, you know, how do you"
724.68,729.8, make a first person platform? And then they took him downstairs and he was jumping up and down on
729.8,735.56, skate. And it was just great to see him excited of games because I guess he does that tour every year
735.64,741.64," so he went to Microsoft and Sony to check out their stuff. It's just, it's a privilege to, uh,"
741.64,746.68, to see him go around it. Just to see him as excited as our things that would be terrifying. You
746.68,751.3199999999999," know, you don't want me a motor like looking at your game and just, you know, scoffing or whatever."
751.3199999999999,754.68, I don't think he'd ever do that. No. I don't think I'd ever. We're able to get any insight from
754.68,759.3199999999999," all. I mean, just get him to open up and talk about, uh, leave out a start someone who's seen."
759.4000000000001,765.6400000000001," No, I, I, I, I burbled Miyamoto's son. Uh, I don't know whether my, my head touched the floor as"
765.6400000000001,770.6," I bowed, but it was pretty deep. And then I sort of shuffled around with him with various Nintendo"
770.6,776.12," execs saying, is he happy? Does he like that? Is he now? Should I move now? Which is like a coke?"
776.12,781.24," Which is nice. Uh, I mean, it is. So it was just seem to present you something."
781.24,786.12, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not pretty crazy. If this is like a cast system in gaming development.
786.2,790.36," No, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a respect issue. I mean, the guy, the guy's there to see games."
790.36,794.6," He's obviously got a short time. I don't want to bug him. Right. Yeah. I feel, I was taken."
794.6,799.16," If he wants to go out drinking, Mr. Miyamoto's son, I hear my invite. Yeah. If you want to go"
799.16,803.4," thinking. Yeah. If he's like soliciting your questions in your opinion, then it's clear. Yeah."
803.4,808.6," But I mean, I, most people in gaming and I assume him as well, but they just geeks and nuts. Yeah."
808.6,814.52," I mean, you know, we'll write just a great guy to hang out with. Yeah. Absolutely. He's just funny. And,"
815.48,821.3199999999999," I mean, you, you saw the E, the E, A, event. And I wasn't allowed to say it at the show."
821.3199999999999,825.3199999999999," But, you know, I was telling Rick and tell him it was basically nerds on stage. And yeah,"
825.3199999999999,829.96," when I just to go and join arms and tap down to cross, but didn't think that would work."
829.96,834.04," Yeah. Well, real, real, real writers are amazing that way. He, you know, when you, when you think"
834.04,839.88," about, I have no clue how much money he has, but it's got to be a lot, right? I mean, I think so."
840.6,843.96," Given his success and you would, he says one, you would never know."
843.96,847.56," The million years, if you were just like, I mean, I remember like two or three E, three,"
847.56,854.36," three, so go when we were all piling onto the Southwest plane to go down to E three. And we saw him"
854.36,859.0," on the same plane, you know, in coach. And we were like, dude, take your jet."
859.0,861.56," The jet subjects, you know, in Southwest on coach."
862.68,866.68," Huh, coming back from E three, he was just a Jackson wasn't, wasn't coach. Really? Southwest,"
866.76,871.7199999999999, one time. Yeah. Wow. That's a pointless anecdote.
871.7199999999999,875.3199999999999," Did air fair, bad save money. You know, but it is cool to see like, will not. I mean,"
875.3199999999999,877.9599999999999," I don't know, there's like, when people get a lot of money, it's like, what do they do?"
877.9599999999999,883.16," They invest in like jets and stuff and or it's like, will you make your own battlebot center"
883.16,889.16," and, you know, collect, right, stuff from. I think it's great. Cosmonauts. I mean, I mean,"
889.16,893.64," another one is, you know, a game, no, I mean, that guy is like the least potential guy you're"
893.64,896.84," ever going to meet. It's like, do all about the games. They fun."
898.4399999999999,902.4399999999999," I insulted him on my live blog. He's probably never going to talk to me again. Well,"
902.4399999999999,905.48, that I've just said something nice about it. So it makes it work for it. Yeah.
905.48,909.64," Yeah. I was sorry. I mean, are you in trouble? I mean, you were kind of playing a stick for"
909.64,914.36," how was to, you thought you were your, your, your something of the, the yachts you have live blogging."
914.36,921.08," E D three. I was a deep ship. I did. I actually got cornered at the, at the rock band party,"
921.08,926.44," you know, the, the who concert I got cornered before they let us in by a representative of"
926.44,931.96," EA and take to the, the two companies I live blogged, there were two PR people who came up and they"
931.96,937.24," were, he's going to, they were going to need me in one testicle apiece. So I forgive you for the"
937.24,942.0400000000001, head comment. Thank you. I said you had a nice hair. I know. I did. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do.
942.0400000000001,949.88, Right. I complimented you. I guess take two was matter than EA was and and actually the comment was that I had
949.88,956.36," more personal, more personal insults. I thought like the presenters and I did at the EA one."
956.36,960.36," Well, it's texture. I think the audience needs to. I was just trying to say like, here's, yeah,"
960.36,963.88," here's what it's like to be sitting there and well, that did kind of looks like McCain. I mean,"
963.88,969.32, I was doing. I didn't mean it in the bad way. I still want to know what this is. I think McCain's hot looking.
969.32,974.12," We take the podcast the day before you went to that and live blog that and we were talking about,"
974.12,977.72," you know, the borderlands demonstration with Randy Pitchford. And then you went, of course,"
977.72,982.28, and you got the exact same thing with the same level of excitement. But I heard that there were people
982.28,986.6," that were kind of like laughing and giggling during that. And I just like, I don't know, I wanted to think that"
986.6,990.84, maybe they had heard the podcast the night before something. Yeah. I saw him do that.
990.84,997.88, Shkick twice in a row of once in the room where they were doing borderlands and then once at the
997.88,1003.64, take to press conference of front of a bigger crowd where he's playing his own game or he's got a
1003.64,1009.0," couple guys, you know, from gearbox playing and he's commenting on it and nobody loves"
1009.0,1013.88, borderlands more than Randy Pitchford. He just can't get enough of it. It's kind of endearing.
1013.88,1017.96," That's great. I mean, I'm not. I don't mean the bag on the right. It's just funny to watch because"
1017.96,1023.16," normally you get, you know, when you're getting a demo, the demo is like to give them a demo."
1023.16,1028.28," The demo advice comes on. Right. And whatever it is, you don't like is beta. That's the role."
1028.28,1031.32, Don't look at that texture. That's not that's going to change. You didn't like that right.
1031.3999999999999,1036.2," And he's right. But he has none of the sort of nervousness or apologetics sort of like, oh,"
1036.2,1040.12," he's just sort of like, this is awesome. It worked too. Yeah. Because if you looked at one of the,"
1040.12,1045.1599999999999," I think it was Katak who's live blog of the same thing, there, you know, we're making fun of how"
1045.1599999999999,1048.76," at the end of this demo. Did you see that the board of the demo? Well, they're, they're,"
1048.76,1053.48," they're having 50,000 weapons on something. Yeah, 500,000. I'm sorry. Yeah. And they bring"
1053.48,1057.6399999999999," out this character at the end. And it's just like the most random, you know, I compared them to like an"
1057.64,1063.24," NPC quest giver and auto assault, you know, to give you an idea of just like how his role in the"
1063.24,1068.44, larger universe is in the guy comes out. And they act like it's the biggest cliffhanger in any
1068.44,1072.3600000000001," gaming demonstration you've ever seen or like that's more to kind, but you don't get to see what he"
1072.3600000000001,1076.6000000000001," does. And like there were people that, you know, when they live blogged, they're like, oh, God,"
1076.6000000000001,1082.1200000000001," more, he comes more to kind. Yeah. They're like, oh, we have to wait. As if Darth Vader had come back"
1082.1200000000001,1087.0800000000002," or something. Who was that like with something? Among us, like, yeah, I know. And for those,"
1087.1599999999999,1092.04," I mean, some of us sitting there like, ask you, you're like, what? So are you when I can tell you"
1092.04,1099.3999999999999," about more than a guy? Okay. That's good, because we wanted to leave anyway. So, what's if,"
1099.3999999999999,1104.4399999999998," in demonstrations you've given, what's the the most excited you've ever had to be about something"
1104.4399999999998,1108.4399999999998," that you've probably suspected your audience wasn't anywhere near as excited about? Well,"
1108.4399999999998,1115.3999999999999," as you can, as you can tell, as, as my wonderful pill, I'm below will assure you, I'm not going to"
1115.4,1121.16," hand them. I'm not the most dynamic person in the world. So, for me, to come in, you know,"
1121.88,1127.4, I'm not going to bound onto the stage totally pumped. It's just not me. Yeah. But I've done a lot of
1127.4,1133.0," demos where, and I've tried to get out of the habit, but you do catch yourself when you start"
1133.0,1138.8400000000001," doing the apology demo, which is, you know, it's like the amount of times, and it's not like this"
1138.8400000000001,1143.64," game because of X. And by the way, that feature isn't in yet, and it's early beta. And,"
1143.8000000000002,1147.16," well, actually, you know, although it's nearly final with shipping X months, we're still changing"
1147.16,1152.2800000000002," a bunch of stuff that you've just said you didn't like, so don't worry about that. And, you know,"
1152.2800000000002,1158.2," yeah, it's going to sell great because we say it is. And what, oh, yeah, that did have a bad review,"
1158.2,1162.2800000000002," but that's okay. That was a different publication. So, yeah, I've had those"
1162.2800000000002,1166.68, gently backing away as I'm demoing something. I thought I sort of taught myself into a corner.
1166.68,1171.48," So, do you know the word you ever demoing a game where you just, either you know the,"
1171.56,1176.68," you know the game isn't that good, or you just get the feeling that it's not going over a while"
1176.68,1180.52," while you're demoing it, like you're sort of in a flop sweat, like I can't wait to get the hell out of here."
1180.52,1185.32," I've had a lot of guys are hating my game. I've had a lot more of B. I mean, with, with, with A,"
1186.52,1191.0," I generally get enthusiastic about my scam, so that possibly not as enthusiastic as this"
1191.0,1195.32," board landscape. I gotta see that. Yeah. But, there are no fence around you. I mean, we're, we're"
1195.32,1201.1599999999999," and I guess, oh, not at all. But it's just, it was just a weird, like, disconnect between"
1201.1599999999999,1206.6," his level of excitement and our level of anticipation from mortic guys demise. Well, it's just,"
1206.6,1210.12," you know, when somebody's being that enthusiastic about their own thing, it's kind of,"
1210.12,1216.12," there's like not much room left for you to write. Well, glad you're enjoying it so much."
1216.12,1219.56," You're right, Randy, maybe he's endearing me because you're mind's me and my dad. It's like,"
1219.56,1223.1599999999999," whenever you go to a business, he's got to show you everything and take you on these tours,"
1223.16,1226.6000000000001," no matter who's with me, like, a go to my girlfriend and he'll insist on taking us down"
1228.2,1232.2," to his garage and showing us all of his guns and like, he'll make, you know, like, Melissa"
1232.2,1235.24," hold them all. They have tried the action on this. You know, go ahead and load it up and"
1235.24,1240.28," let's just horrify, you know, no interest whatsoever, but it's not just stop, but you have to go"
1240.28,1245.0800000000002," through every single gun in the arsenal. So it's kind of like dad or anything. But not 500,000"
1245.0800000000002,1251.0800000000002," of them. But yeah, he's got like 12 instead of 500,000. 500,000 is awesome. Where, but we're"
1251.1599999999999,1256.1999999999998," just clowning on it on Randy. So, but I've had those interviews where I just know it's"
1256.1999999999998,1261.8799999999999," gone south. You know, the pointed questions coming, which is not, not the, the Sims of course I've"
1261.8799999999999,1266.76," never had these questions, but I know the places, you know, is it? And how do you feel this is appropriate"
1266.76,1274.76," to this franchise? Coat that words such as, do you, do you think that this game still has legs"
1274.76,1279.8799999999999, after all these years? Or why should I be excited about this title? That's always a giveaway right
1279.96,1284.7600000000002, there. After I've just told them how often I'll why I'm excited. And why would I be excited about
1284.7600000000002,1290.7600000000002, this title? I don't think you're going to be. I'm pretty much thinking you hate it. It seems like
1290.7600000000002,1296.2," even more awkward though, like if you had sort of a come in, locking loaded with like a number of"
1296.2,1300.8400000000001," buzzwords. A lot of times, you know, games, the promotional materials, everything will be if it's"
1300.8400000000001,1305.96," not trademark is pet. And you know, and it's like, and it's just another just words for doing"
1305.96,1309.0800000000002," things, there are actions that were already accustomed to doing, but then when there are dynamic"
1309.1599999999999,1312.84," weapons change, yeah, with the buzzword, then that seems like it would get awkward. And then the"
1312.84,1316.28," old one, it's like, I bring it up a lot because I swear I've seen it hundreds of times over the"
1316.28,1320.52, years and that's where someone's pointing out that they've got having physics and that means it
1320.52,1323.8," every time you shoot someone, it's going to be a different game. So they're going to fall a different"
1323.8,1326.84," way. I mean, I don't know what's I've always wondered what's like to be the person that"
1326.84,1332.36," have to tell me that the straight face. It's pretty awful, but people generally down asked me to do that"
1332.36,1338.04," anymore because I just flop it. I can't talk about emergency anymore. You know, oh yeah, that was"
1338.04,1344.36," that one. Although it's accurate for the Sims games, I just can't say it anymore because I'm just tired"
1344.36,1349.8799999999999, of it because people were polarized. Yes. We had that before. We're going to just demonstrate
1349.8799999999999,1353.9599999999998," something that really is interesting and emergent, you know, and not having to really"
1353.9599999999998,1358.28," attach your name to it. I think it would speak for itself, you know. Yeah. I'm like some of"
1358.28,1361.4799999999998, the stuff you know Peter Mohn has been talking so much about the things in favour on it's like
1362.28,1365.4," half the time. You know, half the demos I've seen to give him credit are been when he's telling"
1365.4,1369.16, you what you can there's like just a screen. The game is just on in the background with nothing
1369.16,1372.84," happening and he's telling you about all these things that can happen in this canvas, but instead"
1372.84,1378.84," if you just showed me, but Peter Mohn is he's one of my heroes because you know, just just like"
1378.84,1383.88, we'll write and me a moto and all of these legends who have been around for such a long time. The thing
1383.88,1387.32," I really admire about him is first of all, they're still working. You know, they're putting in the"
1387.3999999999999,1391.8," time and putting in the hours. Yeah. And secondly, all of them have just been kicked in the"
1391.8,1397.24, teeth and flopped at some point in their career where people like that's it. You jump the shock.
1397.24,1401.24," You're your career is over and they just dutters the dust of themselves off. I'm said,"
1401.24,1406.12," nope, I'm going to get back to my king games. Yeah, I love those. Yeah, I think like Peter's like"
1406.12,1409.8799999999999," even the movies, I think it was ahead of its time, you know. I mean, that didn't come out like"
1409.8799999999999,1414.28," maybe now or in the next couple years and it was all online. In the beginning, it was like a"
1414.28,1418.2," free online game or something like a battlefield of heroes. You know, well, I love black and white."
1418.2,1423.8799999999999, I feel black and white was great. I know that there was a big to do about it. Got too many good reviews.
1423.8799999999999,1428.76," But it's still a great game. Like you open up. Hey, that's really, that's really cool."
1428.76,1433.0," Man, this is why she hit the hardcore puzzles, maybe it. I'm glad that there are people like"
1433.0,1436.68," him. I mean, otherwise who's going to be making those games right now at that budget. You know,"
1436.68,1443.08," I mean, we'd see them on the various, you know, Xbox live and places like that, you know, but"
1443.32,1446.84," I'm sure my proposal quest expansions out today. Right. Oh, don't tell Ryan."
1446.84,1451.1599999999999," All right. Ryan. Ryan. A lot of black music. He's a question nerd. Oh, yeah."
1452.52,1457.8, I don't know. I think I'm waiting for the sequel. Electrics? Yeah. Yeah. That look cool. I tried to
1457.8,1463.48, wizzle a pre release copy of the show. I'm absolutely excited. Yeah. I know that one of the
1463.48,1467.96," ladies who works there she used to work at Sonny House. I'm begging. Come on, I want to do ideas."
1467.96,1475.08," So when you say sequel, you mean like the plot continues. It's a sci-fi. Yeah. It's so set in a different"
1475.08,1481.4, unit of puzzle quests in the future. Okay. So maybe that'll be like a comic book in between the two
1481.4,1489.96," to time together. Maybe. Maybe an animated comic book. Be pretty cool. So Rod, what's some of the"
1489.96,1494.76, least likely places you and the people you work with of John inspiration from the games that you make?
1495.72,1500.76," Oh, I'm going to bring up puzzle quests. No, I mean, it doesn't have to be within games."
1501.48,1505.0," I could prompt you a little on that one. That's it. I mean, I'll let you talk. But"
1505.0,1509.32," but as soon as you asked that, John, I thought about when we when we came to your office for the"
1509.32,1514.44," Sims 3 cover story and you showed John Maloy and I all those prototypes, all those different"
1514.44,1520.04, games you made where you had all the different developers were assigned to prototype the game
1520.12,1526.6," based on shit. What was it? It was a certain concept. We did a bunch of one day prototypes,"
1526.6,1536.52, one was on a caring. So some of the ones that kind of weird I guess is a lot of study of
1537.56,1543.32," ethics through the ages because when you look at ethics, a lot of it is how you treat"
1543.3999999999999,1550.04, him and being and what those edges are. And so that's really been trusted the sense. It's how far
1550.04,1556.76," we can push it and at what point does it? Does it cross a certain ethical line? So, you know,"
1557.96,1563.32, can't want ethics as one of those. So it's awfully pretentious but true.
1563.32,1567.48," Hey, you can, there's this gate clause because like all the Star Trek and next generation episodes"
1567.48,1571.8," are all basically based on like, you know, Stuart Mills and Nathan, all these, I mean,"
1572.68,1577.1599999999999," over and over again, these same dumb whimmers and you tell a term in doesn't mean. Right. And I think,"
1577.1599999999999,1583.1599999999999," I think, I think computer programmers in particular, we're fascinated by the idea of ethical rules."
1583.1599999999999,1588.2," It's like, can we can we program a set of rules that like cover it? No, it's the answer,"
1588.76,1595.48," but it's a noble thing to try and look at because it's, it's really interesting. Right."
1595.48,1600.3600000000001, How you can get math to fit ethics. What about the temptation to?
1600.3600000000001,1603.8, To the latest answer. I'm going to get to be the same online. Let you have the hook.
1603.8,1610.68," What about the temptation to be inspired by something and then just have this drive,"
1610.68,1615.32," I want to incorporate it or some facet of it into the game when, you know, either your,"
1615.32,1620.68," the only enthusiast for the idea on that or, or just a daily thing, right? I mean, you work"
1620.68,1624.76," from a design doc and there you have it and it's not like, unlike, you know, when I was talking"
1624.84,1629.8799999999999," to the guy, the marketing guy for postal three and he didn't seem to be able to account for a lot of the things in the game."
1629.8799999999999,1634.52," That, in that game's case, it seemed as though it really wasn't matter of, you get an idea,"
1634.52,1639.8," you just throw it in, you know? Right. I know, I run into that a lot. There are things that I think are"
1639.8,1646.04," particularly cool. So when we made open for business, I was obsessed that everyone in the world would"
1646.04,1650.92, want to run their own bookstore. So we had to have the deepest ability to create your own bookstore
1650.92,1655.72," and the open for business, pack that you possibly could, send that nobody else, Rick."
1655.72,1660.6000000000001," Yeah, I want to hear about that. I did. What did they want to do? What kind of businesses did they want to run?"
1661.4,1666.28," First of all, they wanted to make houses of a repute. They figured that out real quick."
1666.28,1669.88," That was the first boom. Like, and we thought we like, we're making a cool,"
1669.88,1672.68, big invention. Yeah. You give them a chance to become professionals.
1673.24,1677.8000000000002," Then a lot of restaurants, a lot of people, which I guess is right, you know,"
1677.96,1681.56," everyone's starting a restaurant and said, I could do this. So brothels and restaurants."
1681.56,1685.08," That's why. Seconds and restaurants is another weird, like,"
1685.08,1688.28," go big with this thing. Right. I mean, like, say, say, say, if you're an immigrant and you"
1688.28,1691.48," come over and for the first generation, you're starting a business often, you do what you know,"
1691.48,1695.32, and it's run a restaurant. You have that in the spectrum. But then you have all these people who are
1695.32,1700.12," already, you know, rich and wealthy and well, the view and their society. And then what do they want to"
1700.12,1704.44, do? They talk about retiring and opening a restaurant. We've had even Shane Betonhouse and works here
1704.92,1708.1200000000001, on time. It came up. What else would you do if you're not doing this? He said he wanted
1708.1200000000001,1717.16, to open a restaurant. So what? Shane? Yeah. Yeah. It's a human need. But I was one of those immigrant
1717.16,1722.44," guys who came to when when I first came to the States, because I'd been brought up in a fairly"
1722.44,1727.0800000000002," small village in England. It options. And then we go open a fishing ship. Yeah. Well, you know,"
1728.28,1734.3600000000001," English, we have many strengths. I don't think food is one of them. But the"
1734.36,1738.1999999999998," but I was, I was one of those sad immigrants like sad at the food court at the moment."
1738.1999999999998,1742.76, I can't believe how many choices there are. It's fantastic. Look at this. Look at this.
1742.76,1749.9599999999998, Chinese. Is everything. They are suck. They will fantastic to me. I was from England. Right.
1749.9599999999998,1754.6," And outside of the city, trust me. And I think it wasn't for oil. It was great. Right. Maybe it took"
1754.6,1759.1599999999999, you like 10 years to cross the ocean or something because it's actually at the same range. You got
1759.1599999999999,1762.9199999999998," stuck in like the Brimuda Dragon because I'm sure you have the same room. No, man. Because if you look"
1763.0,1767.64," back here, right? In our day, what are your choices? Like you get a cracker or you get like"
1767.64,1772.8400000000001," chicken at a biscuit. That's like the extreme in. And nowadays it's like, you know, sun dried tomato"
1772.8400000000001,1776.68," and crack pepper. You can get it with like curry on them and like any. I mean, there's just"
1776.68,1781.3200000000002," like so much more variety now in general. Like to go along with, you know, the changes and"
1782.1200000000001,1787.4," demographics in the country and stuff. Well, the little non fact that the, uh, it is a fact that"
1787.4,1792.76, I'll show you is if you get a chance and you got to England eat a Kentucky fried
1793.72,1799.24," chicken. It is better in England than in America. And I take the taste test. That's my, that's my"
1799.24,1804.6, I'm an ordinary investor. But you really should have the English chickens or casket or something.
1804.6,1809.56," They actually, so that you get little lemon soap, papian app canes, the chicken is less greasy,"
1809.56,1814.52, the sides are different. It's for the whole experience is just nicer. It's a finer dining experience.
1815.32,1821.64," You rub the chicken leg on the wall and see outside. No, you can't. It's, uh, it really is better."
1821.72,1826.2," So it's a, it's a call. One of the few things that you can eat that's been ringling than he has."
1826.2,1832.1200000000001," So I'm pushing it. Hey, I'm a big fan of it. Next time you go send me up some some round trees"
1832.1200000000001,1835.5600000000002, fruit gums. That's good stuff. I've never won the 80 year. I know that's all right.
1836.76,1841.0, I'm curious now about this Kentucky fried chicken. You got to try it. England. You got to try it.
1841.0,1847.4, I want confirmation from some English podcast listener. Go to go to our forum and and confirm
1847.4,1852.3600000000001, whether Rod is full of shit. It's a mystery. It has in-game restaurants and on the back one of the
1852.3600000000001,1857.48," ballpoint is not the amount of you can. If I was that evil, that would be so based on the"
1857.48,1863.0800000000002," Manchester, Kentucky fried chicken. You got to do the comparison that between America and the UK."
1863.0800000000002,1867.72, Are you even going to get those two to in one place for that taste test? You do what I do.
1867.72,1872.0400000000002, You eat here. You get on a plane. You get off the plane. You eat there. Wow. You're that rich.
1872.52,1876.84, You're an idiot. I think some chicken is not a private plane. Okay.
1876.84,1882.44," They say that's like something different. I guess I am. Yeah, I believe you. I can see that."
1882.44,1887.1599999999999, It's good stuff. Yeah. I can believe the aesthetic experience would be better too.
1887.1599999999999,1892.12," That you get like better sides and you know, well the English service isn't particularly good."
1892.12,1897.1599999999999," I mean it's polite but you get abused. So you know, let's kind of balance things."
1897.16,1900.3600000000001, That depends on which kFC you go to here. Like KFC and Berkeley where we live.
1901.16,1906.0400000000002," And like all the restaurants there, like right on some public, they've got like bulletproof glass and stuff on there."
1906.0400000000002,1910.28," They're driving through. Like something's up. You know, like the state of a town"
1910.28,1915.4," by how like if you can't use a public restroom, you know, it's fucked up place."
1915.4,1918.76," Like even later, you know, Barnes and Noble, they don't have the bathroom more like when"
1918.76,1922.2," Taco Bell, when there's bulletproof glass to conduct a transaction. So it's like,"
1922.2,1927.8, I'm going to give you three bucks and you're going to give me a fucking two tacos and it's like a Mexican
1927.8,1934.68," standoff, you know, a straight and items and fans to star online. I'll put down the food and you put down"
1934.68,1942.76," the money at the same time. Yeah, we're both right. You bet you like poop point guns. I wrote like"
1942.76,1947.88, the stupidest like short story about that. We're like it is but going through that sand Pablo Taco
1948.7600000000002,1952.92, and there's a you know how there's actually the trust their employees so little that there's a little like a
1954.1200000000001,1959.5600000000002," digital readout that says your total here, if the total that the that the employee quotes you differs"
1959.5600000000002,1963.64," from this, please call this number immediately. So I just changed it so that was actually a button that"
1963.64,1968.2800000000002, went directly into the local police department. Like if you press that and it ended with like of course
1968.2800000000002,1973.3200000000002," them like, you know, basically pointing guns at each other like over the getting the two cents back"
1973.3999999999999,1978.84," change. We were talking about that before the podcast, but to me like I'm from England so I don't care"
1978.84,1984.04, that my that my son like plays with toy guns. It freaks my wife out because to me guns are like
1984.04,1987.6399999999999," best, you know, they're not real. They're not going to show up at your house anytime. I'm saying"
1987.6399999999999,1991.96, there's guns and I don't really have that in the app. But over here it's kind of a big deal so she freaks out.
1991.96,1995.72, That's really interesting. So like growing up in England there isn't the sort of like
1995.72,2000.84," because certainly in my house, both when I was a kid and then as a father, too, there's a big thing"
2000.84,2009.72," about like, you know, don't let like to this day in my daughter's 14, I will not play games where"
2009.72,2013.8799999999999, I'm shooting things on screen just to not influence badly influenced my kids. That's because you're
2013.8799999999999,2019.32," burgly dead. Well that's true. I am a burgly, I'm living in burgly and california with a French"
2019.32,2024.12, wife who's very left wing and etc. Most of the buttons just turn on the most fucking Republican
2024.1999999999998,2029.4799999999998, shit. So I don't know if you can play and you give you BB guns and toy guns that you have to be
2029.4799999999998,2035.1599999999999," black and look exactly like really good. Well, like I played army as a kid in Los Angeles, but"
2035.1599999999999,2039.8799999999999," but my parents who were kind of hippish frowned on it, too. So I did this behind their back."
2039.8799999999999,2043.6399999999999," Like we wanted to do it at my house, but we got one of my friend's houses and we put on our army"
2043.6399999999999,2049.96, fatigues and shoot each other with sticks back then. But all I had given was toy guns when I was a kid.
2050.04,2054.68," And so there wasn't like a stigma from your parents or... No, no, no. Because you know what was"
2054.68,2061.48, going to happen? It wasn't like I was going to go and get one. Right. It was England. So my first
2061.48,2068.84, first memory is playing with toy soldiers in the sand pit and then my first big toy was a plastic M60.
2069.96,2074.6, We pulled the trigger and it made it noise. It was awesome. That's so cool. So we used to run around
2074.6,2078.44, the garage and I had the back of the house and we used to play and I was the king of the roost until
2079.08,2084.76," I smashed it. So is your wife American? Yes, she is. Okay. So if you brought home an M16 for"
2084.76,2089.88," your five-year-old son, let's say you came up tonight with an M16. Oh, toy one."
2091.08,2097.56," Or a toy one. Yeah, or a toy one. And handed it to your kid with your wife P. Pest? Yes."
2097.56,2102.68, That would it would go immediately into the trash. Really different. Now to the like first thing would be
2103.64,2108.7599999999998," if it was bright orange would make some difference. I mean, then there's the other case."
2108.7599999999998,2112.3599999999997, You give kind of guns that we played with as kids. You're kids now. They're going the street
2112.3599999999997,2116.9199999999996," and police officer was shooting or something. Yeah, even if like say it was like purple,"
2116.9199999999996,2121.96, bright purple with whatever. That would be frowned upon. That would be frowned upon. I might be
2123.64,2129.3999999999996, I might be able to swing it maybe one or maybe. But if it was a water pistol.
2129.4,2137.88," What if it was his animal if it was anator? I don't know. Wait, what if it was a let's just do it this"
2137.88,2143.1600000000003," time. She's getting you know, you said you like ethical scruples, man. We're holding you to"
2143.1600000000003,2149.8, the first time that he opened up on my one-year-old daughter with a knife bullet. Not like
2149.8,2154.52," blue and nocturover, I think that that was I would be in trouble for it. So because I'd be the"
2154.52,2158.6, Alm's dealer bringing it into the river. I think it into the country that's a failed stay.
2160.36,2166.68," So how is she about gaming in general? Your game developer, it's your profession. I assume you're also a"
2166.68,2171.4," gamer. Yeah, is she a gamer? No, no, she she she she she disapproves I think."
2172.68,2177.96, Modely disapproves of what I do and would rather waste that I had a different kind of career. She's
2177.96,2184.68," not into it at all. But again, it's a bad time to ask because the other day she came home."
2184.68,2190.12," My son was running around playing army, which is very unusual and so that raised her eyebrow."
2190.12,2194.6," And then he said the phrase, Dad, Dad, we're going to make our own bad company."
2195.64,2200.2," And as she knew the title of the game, I was playing bad company. She was not. And then he said,"
2200.2,2204.2," I thought, Mom, Mom, Dad, Dad let me block the buildings and pull the trigger on the gun."
2204.68,2209.24," And then I was just totally yeah, you're busted. Yeah, you got to train him."
2209.24,2214.4399999999996, Totally deaf child to talk about games in front of mom. Right. That's that that's the phrases you
2214.4399999999996,2220.4399999999996," don't like to hear. Don't tell me. Yeah, that's well, what was that topic of guns to reassure you."
2220.4399999999996,2224.7599999999998, I don't want to let this opportunity pass by. It also to reassure you that you guys are both good parents.
2224.7599999999998,2229.7999999999997," Like when we do it, we had BB guns and remember in front of Alvin, he told us a thing who was with us."
2229.8,2234.2000000000003," He's like, go change the target. And then he pumps the gun like 10 times and shoots him in the ass."
2234.2000000000003,2239.7200000000003," Like as he's, he's changing the target. And it's like, Why did you do that? Because they"
2239.7200000000003,2244.36, is rolling around the ground screaming and you look at Alvin asking why I did it. Because it was funny.
2245.1600000000003,2249.96," Wow, kids and guns. It's good stuff. Why shot guns in Boy Scouts? So that's how I"
2250.6800000000003,2254.52," that's the responsibility. Yeah, that's some, some. Well, that's the"
2254.52,2259.0," feeling. So that's the feeling. Father like, figure. Right. It was like a pose and basically like a Jewish"
2259.0,2264.2," boy's got trip. We weren't exactly thugs. You know, we're going straight from Hebrew school to"
2264.2,2267.96," to, you know, rifle range, attending. We were shooting Nazis."
2270.2,2277.32," When home and head are a chicken soup. However, where is the zombie ties? I don't"
2277.4,2284.28," anywhere. I'm just, talk, I'm just, it's move on. Those are the get-old day. So that's interesting."
2284.28,2288.28," You're saying that you're, you're wife. I mean, of all, you know, I mean, of all the, the franchise"
2288.28,2291.56," as you handle. I mean, there have to, there have to be some people in gaming with like,"
2291.56,2296.1200000000003," I, I, only I wasn't working on a postal three years of that. I was working on the Sims."
2296.1200000000003,2300.44," Didn't my, my wife would understand. Yeah, she doesn't like it. My brother, uh, who, who"
2300.44,2306.1200000000003," lives in England with his wife, he and his wife love the Sims. And they loved it before I worked on it."
2306.44,2311.88," That's great. So the set validate you a little bit more. Um, yeah. Although, if, if you've"
2311.88,2317.3199999999997," met my brother, it, it's annoying because he's, he's just much more likable than me. So I,"
2317.3199999999997,2321.96," I don't, to talk about him. So people don't get to meet him. I was your brother was on this podcast."
2321.96,2326.12," I need to see it. That's the way all, all of growing up. Next week, Rod's brother, Rod's"
2326.12,2331.0," cooler brother. He is his cooler. And everybody who needs him, like, all my friends growing up,"
2331.0,2335.3199999999997," like, I try not to let them meet my brother because he, because they all preferred him."
2335.32,2338.04," I'm like, hey, you're, but it's really cool. Man, you got to put him in the"
2338.04,2345.1600000000003, Sims three is like some big dorks. That's my revenge. Some guy that everybody hates wants to kick his ass.
2345.1600000000003,2350.04," Yeah. Then no, then we'll, sorry. So did they get the village idiot, you know,"
2350.04,2354.6800000000003, wandering around and knocking on the Sims houses. Who? That'd be good. I like that.
2354.6800000000003,2359.96," So you, I mean, you got to be somewhat nervous, not that like there's much like we heard that"
2359.96,2364.1200000000003," the next Sims is going to get going to tank or anything. But I mean, given,"
2364.12,2368.3599999999997," I was going with the given it's built in success so far. I mean, that would be pretty horrible."
2368.3599999999997,2373.3199999999997," Right? I mean, like, what is, is that your worst nightmare, like, save? You take this, this unstoppable"
2373.3199999999997,2378.12, franchise. Right. That's stop it. And you're associated with it. I kind of like that. I actually
2378.12,2383.96," drive it into the ground. Yeah. You know, I'd probably like, you know, have a big an aim by doing"
2383.96,2387.3199999999997," that than actually doing a good job. I could be like, well, sure. I'd seen what I'm"
2387.32,2393.88," killed the Sims for. Yeah. It's a very awesome. Well, I mean, I get that every time we release"
2393.88,2399.32," a game because the sad truth is, and I wish it was the opposite, but the sad truth is is that no"
2399.32,2404.28," franchise name will sell a game for you. It just won't. I mean, and God knows, I've tried"
2405.1600000000003,2409.1600000000003," being a slap, slap the Sims name on something, and it does not equal sales."
2409.1600000000003,2413.2400000000002," Um, because you think that that's true across the board though. Like I remember like when I was"
2413.3199999999997,2418.8399999999997," surprised when when Medal of Honor rising sun came out, and I thought it was a mediocre shooter,"
2418.8399999999997,2423.8799999999997," but at least by the series on standards, and it did over a million, like right away. Right."
2423.8799999999997,2427.3999999999996," I mean, you could disagree with me on that, but it's like, I mean, I think I wasn't like"
2427.3999999999996,2431.9599999999996," all the cases where it's like, I'm pretty sure that the brands playing a pretty significant role."
2431.9599999999996,2435.0," And the fact, of course, like how many sequels write that EA publishes? Right. I mean,"
2435.0,2439.24," there's a reason they're publishing sequels rather than new IP. I mean, EA does publish new IP all"
2439.3199999999997,2443.16," the time. There's many coming up this year, but there's a reason why they're mixing those eggs"
2443.16,2448.7599999999998, in the basket and not I'd say that there's a difference between franchises that have
2449.56,2458.2," a an aspiration to them, like being a hero in the Pacific versus one that is game play oriented,"
2458.2,2463.72," which is the Sims. You know, I don't think that there's much of a, there isn't a aspirational"
2463.72,2468.12," fictional fantasy associated with the Sims that's a strong changing day, Bruce. Right. You know,"
2468.2,2472.3599999999997, it's sort of what you make it. So I think that the game play really does matter.
2472.3599999999997,2475.88," Wait a minute, though. Let's see if that's, I just want to challenge that. I mean, because when you look at"
2475.88,2480.3599999999997," the expansion packs, and again, I speak from like, which I'll find products. I'm happy to defend the"
2480.3599999999997,2484.3599999999997," expansion. But I mean, aren't they aspirational, right? I mean, they're about you get these houses."
2484.3599999999997,2488.7599999999998, You get an HM pack. You get to go on the shopping sprees that you maybe can't really afford to go on
2488.7599999999998,2492.8399999999997," in real life. I mean, people can, people who can buy Sims can shop at HNM or whatever, but they're not"
2492.8399999999997,2496.92, going to be buying everything in the store in the way that they will with the expansions and stuff.
2496.92,2501.4," I mean, it's like, yeah, it's and all these things that you get in Sims. I mean, it seems fairly"
2501.4,2505.96," that that is true, but that's based primarily off a lot of focus groups who do with each pack."
2507.0,2512.04," Because we want a, that one I used to business would because we want to repeat business."
2512.04,2516.04," You know, we don't want to mess it up. And some packs do sell a lot less than others."
2516.84,2521.0," Oh, oh, in this case, what I'm bringing up about those is the packs is not that, that it's a matter"
2521.0,2525.88," of, you know, like, okay, you know, cashing in on the name or using the name to sell itself. But"
2525.96,2529.2400000000002," the aspirational thing though, you know, and you're saying that like in, you know, metal"
2529.2400000000002,2534.76," water rising sun, you're saying, okay, I want to be, you know, an American GI in the Pacific Sea"
2534.76,2539.6400000000003," in World War II. In this case, I mean, it's, I'm saying it's kind of like aspirational lifestyle,"
2539.6400000000003,2543.6400000000003," right? Like people watch crates and stuff like that. And it's like here in the Sims, you get to"
2543.6400000000003,2547.8," put together this perfect world. I think, yeah, I think it's extra, I think it's extra tools"
2547.8,2554.12," that you can use to be creative. But I think that the, you know, the great unspoken secret of the"
2554.2,2559.4," Sims is the people who play it. I don't think, uh, regard the game the same way people who"
2559.4,2564.44," don't play it do. So I think that people who play it would say, yeah, I tell stories, but"
2564.44,2570.8399999999997," it's because I'm creative. It's, you know, it's stuff that I do. I don't think that someone who buys,"
2570.8399999999997,2576.92," you know, seasons is saying, I'm really attracted to the idea of winter or these things that like,"
2576.92,2580.92," hey, I've got extra tools to tell my story. So I think it's a little bit different. But I know what"
2581.0,2586.44," you're saying. I guess I took myself into a corner. Do you think that people who, um,"
2586.44,2591.32," you know, who used the Sims to tell these stories are largely like, you know, aware or self"
2591.32,2594.6800000000003, reflexive of the stories they're telling about what they say about themselves? I bring this up
2594.6800000000003,2598.84," because, you know, Sean Maloya was on her staff and we did this, you know, the series of essays on,"
2598.84,2603.32," you know, the way that we play games, you know, and what it says about ourselves. In his case,"
2603.32,2610.52," it was about the Sims, it was the franchise he used. And it changes a lot. So Sims, Sims plays"
2610.68,2614.44, when you talk to them. One of the things I find most interesting is when they change from third
2614.44,2620.36," person to first person mid sentence. So you know, a lot of Sims players will say, I went on a date"
2620.36,2625.08," but my Sim messed it up. You know, that's a really interesting thing. Yeah, it's a weird. Um, and,"
2625.08,2633.0," uh, I think that each person's gameplay with them, the Sims is different. So, you know, I don't think"
2633.96,2638.36, I don't think it's unusual for a lot of core gamers to play the Sims to have sex with lots of
2638.36,2642.36," checks. And, you know, it's like, I'm going to make the dude and we're going to do this. I'm going"
2642.36,2647.4," to make how my house looked when I was that age and we'll see what happens, you know. Um, and I,"
2648.28,2653.8, I think that that is one of those unspoken things that a lot of core gamers do. And since you
2653.8,2658.04," got it, like you can't, you can't, you can't thwart those expectations. No, it's, it's all right. I"
2658.04,2663.0," look, yeah, I embrace it. I think it's good stuff. I, uh, I also think, well, I know the lot of core"
2663.08,2668.44," gamers buy the Sims and the expansion packs, whether they want to admit it or not, because we"
2668.44,2671.64," talked to them. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,"
2671.64,2675.88," it was a closet activity among them. You know, for some reason, I think I think when it comes"
2675.88,2681.16," to online gaming, sorry, online gaming forums, I think it is a little bit, I think that, um,"
2681.16,2686.36," yeah, so we, we do a lot of reach out to our customers. And so what you, what we'll do is we'll have"
2686.36,2692.28," focus groups reach pack. And before they come in, you ask how much do you play? And so we'll say things,"
2692.28,2698.28," like, you know, we'll have a bunch of players who, a bunch of guys between 16 and 25, all of"
2698.28,2704.28," whom play the Sims 10 hours a week. And then once they get in a room together, we'll say,"
2704.28,2709.2400000000002," how often do you play the, wow, you know, pick up a girlfriend's copy occasionally. And,"
2710.52,2716.2000000000003," that's awesome, you know, what, what are you doing the game? Yeah, off camera, they've alone,"
2716.2000000000003,2719.5600000000004," they said, you know, they do furnishings and they like building little houses, you know,"
2719.56,2724.12," wow, you know, back chicks, you know, the conflan, guess, get your car, get to the top of the"
2724.12,2731.72," career ladder, you know, I get back to plan, called for kick-le-last. If you could, like, you"
2731.72,2739.0," don't take that footage and then juxtapose the tape, it's really easy. Well, I really want,"
2739.0,2743.4," I'm, I'm really hoping that you put in, you know, more, more colors of paint for the walls and"
2743.4,2748.92," stuff. And I, I really felt, uh, it's, I mean, I was like, that was the E3, the E3 conference,"
2748.92,2753.2400000000002," I mentioned spiral stack cases, and that I believe there are a couple of people report us in the"
2753.2400000000002,2756.76," audience who are brave enough to cheer and they're like, oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
2756.76,2761.4," like spiral stack cases. So I'm saying, it's good, you can do a lot of cool houses with them, you know,"
2761.4,2766.6800000000003," it's all right. It has an opportunity for an IKEA themed expansion pack,"
2766.6800000000003,2772.2000000000003," ever, we've just done our IKEA stuff. Wow, oh my gosh, I'm not really going to get to make"
2772.2000000000003,2778.12," you, and, and it's number one in the chart, it knocks for off the, off the top. Did it? That,"
2778.2,2784.7599999999998," there you go. Yeah, all right. In your face, right? What you aspire to is just just like imitating"
2784.7599999999998,2789.48," your, I mean, what's that about? Is it like you say that there's a game that's got to be a"
2789.48,2793.72," one? My life in it. So then my life must be good. They're making games about it. I mean,"
2793.72,2799.3199999999997," like, what's on there? I mean, I think that a lot of the reason for the some successes, just,"
2800.44,2805.96," we, you know, if you go into a bookstore, look at the amount of categories of drama, romance,"
2806.04,2812.6," you know, there's a whole swath, swath, a of categories that just games generally don't"
2812.92,2819.32," cover and the Sims covers more. So we, we benefit. I would like to, I, I'm not, one of those"
2819.32,2824.28," closeted Sims players I'd like to show. I'd like to find, I mean, I like the idea of it. And I'm glad"
2824.28,2827.96," you're wearing a Sims shirt though, they use this. You have to see that, but that's okay, man."
2827.96,2831.8," I like that. That's all right. I like that just whole style. It came with the expansion pack,"
2831.8,2838.6800000000003," I threw the expansion away. The shirt. I like the idea of it. And it's like, I want to be"
2838.6800000000003,2843.96," able to get into it. But the one time I tried it, it was like, it was the Xbox version. Right. And it was"
2843.96,2847.0," just like, that doesn't count. This character needs to like go the bathroom room,"
2847.0,2850.6000000000004," take me in, so needs to sleep and get irritable. And it really felt like babysins. I,"
2850.6000000000004,2855.5600000000004, I fucked up. I want to do it with this. But I heard about all the great stuff. People
2855.5600000000004,2859.88," like, you can make him go crazy and build a, build him into tiny room, you know, and I didn't"
2859.88,2864.44, see that. So I got to had to crap his pants for five minutes and got cranky if you didn't sleep every 30.
2865.2400000000002,2866.92, I had to take care from Sean.
2868.92,2874.6800000000003," Sure, responsibility. I totally got it. I was like you. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't want to. Before they"
2874.6800000000003,2880.6, started paying you a lot. That's right. Yeah. I want to know a knee-i-k-e expansion. Do you
2880.6,2885.32," do the Sims have to make their furniture? No, they don't. Do they have to go through and"
2885.32,2889.0800000000004, actually find their way through that thing? Because then you can introduce some cool navigation
2889.0800000000004,2892.92, or puzzles. Yeah. You can get it and build by the way. You can't. I think would be so difficult.
2892.92,2896.6800000000003," You can make your own IKEA store if you're like, oh, you can. I'm sure that's a fantasy."
2896.6800000000003,2899.48," Yeah. Then you have to eat because you know, you have to eat every 10 minutes or whatever."
2899.48,2903.32, It was. You can get your leg and berries and meatballs and that's what you could stuff. Keep hitting it.
2904.1200000000003,2907.2400000000002," But I keep that. I mean, that seems weird to me too. That like, someone, I mean, that would be"
2907.2400000000002,2911.48," like having a Walmart expansion in a way. Because I mean, IKEA furniture is like,"
2912.36,2916.84," it's like tink of toy stuff. You know, it's like shitty. I mean, when I look at it and I think about"
2916.84,2920.84," how living standards it's like quality product. You look at like sure it, you know,"
2920.84,2925.2400000000002," a century ago, far fewer people had really high quality furniture, but the ones that did it was"
2925.8,2929.88," is really nice handcrafted stuff. And you look at this and it's like, it's all particle board"
2929.88,2933.56," with sticker, the color would on it. Like everything. But if you, if you want to make"
2934.2,2941.08," your life when you're in college, you know, then you need it. They know me. My CD towers are"
2941.24,2946.04," IKEA. I've met it. I've most of the shit in my house is like, yeah, that's all I can afford."
2946.04,2951.0," I can't lie about it. I mean, I have it, but that's the that's the difference between saying I need to"
2951.0,2956.04," get a game where I can get the things shit digital versions. Will it break when I move it? Well,"
2956.04,2959.0," that's why I want the Sims to have to make bottom of the shelf. Say, want them to get"
2959.0,2964.36," all frustrated at the instructions, you know, that have no words on them. That's a fantastic pack."
2964.36,2970.12," So what is what is the number one? Is he think that's is that like out of, I mean, is that beyond"
2970.2,2976.92, comprehension that there would be a virtual Walmart in this pack? We choose a dollar store. We choose
2976.92,2983.64," that pot. 99 cents, dorks, man. Do you know there's something, I mean, there's a Walmart"
2983.64,2988.8399999999997, hole. A lot of people go there. I was at a Walmart and clear lake this weekend. It was some
2988.8399999999997,2993.4," sad shit. I mean, all Walmart, I think are sad fundamentals. I'm speaking, this is not our saddest"
2993.4,2998.68," of 90s. So in case you aren't, I don't want to like, I just like to say to you, if I, if I, if I"
2998.68,3003.24," just say because Walmart is, is one of our biggest customers. Oh, yeah. That, that, that, that,"
3003.24,3009.16, that it's a fine store. And I particularly think that that that that publishing buyers who buy
3009.16,3013.72, out products for their shelves are great human beings. That's a lot of people say we're trying to
3013.72,3019.24," encourage. My, yes, I have nothing to do with again. Rod Humble or yes. In fact, he probably"
3019.24,3024.2," finds some odious. But, but I think Walmart's are personally depressing even when they're no"
3024.2799999999997,3029.3199999999997," people in them. But this was the one where like all jokes aside, every single person I saw"
3029.3199999999997,3034.2799999999997," on there was obese. Like, I mean, I'm not exaggerating. I'm not, and it was also about like 98"
3034.2799999999997,3039.96, degrees out there. So that meant that you could say that about GDC on extra display. This was far
3039.96,3044.2799999999997," worth. Because like, Melissa was like, look, look, you know, it's like, okay, what am I looking at?"
3044.2799999999997,3047.96," Because every direction I looked, there was something like, noteworthy, right? It would be like"
3047.96,3051.3999999999996," blog where there's something, but then like behind us, there was this one. It's a little"
3051.4,3057.4, odd like the biggest games. I think a lot of you. There's probably by the games from Wolf
3057.4,3065.2400000000002," on. So my magazine anymore. So the client out of Supreme client out. Now I say, yeah,"
3065.2400000000002,3070.6, it's all bitterness. I called a Fupa and Flapjacks because she was wearing a bikini top and
3070.6,3077.08, it was pretty gross. And toenails look like so faint tape wrapped up. I had to get out of that
3077.16,3082.52," place. Sorry. What are you doing there? I was looking, I don't know what we were doing."
3082.52,3086.2799999999997, Getting some stats or something. Nothing is sad or something. There's a bundle.
3086.2799999999997,3090.84," Then the new 99 cent store by both of our house, Sean, have you been in there yet? No."
3090.84,3094.52," Oh, the right by your place. Yeah, that's great for your property value. Yeah, tell me."
3094.52,3099.4, And now the thing has been like three different things. And every time it goes down the socio
3099.4,3105.24," economic scale. And it's just a bad sign. It is sad though because the building, it used to be a"
3105.24,3109.56," theater. It used to be a movie theater. Yes. It's got a really like high roof, you know, with some"
3110.12,3114.12," kind of cool art. That one. Then it was some kind of market, some kind of supermarket. That's like a"
3114.12,3118.68," right-aid or something. Yeah. Then it was a long, long, long, long, long, drugs failed. And now it's"
3118.68,3122.68," a 99. And before we didn't know what it was going to be. And we were like, please be trader Joe's."
3122.68,3126.52," Be something. Oh, that would have been something. No, you don't want that. The traffic did."
3126.52,3131.08," Whatever. I take the traffic if it would just not be, you know, another blight on the neighbor"
3131.64,3136.6," along with the chet caching place and whatever the other crap that's right. Yeah, that's what they can have inside"
3136.6,3142.04," their chet caching. And yeah, so it's a 99 cent store now. And I went there on my first day back from"
3142.04,3148.44," Europe. And it was just the worst possible cultural transition whatsoever to go from, you know,"
3148.44,3154.2," Italy and Spain and nice places in there into the 99 cent store on Sam Pablo Avenue. And Berkeley,"
3154.2,3160.52," it was just like, oh, why? Why would that be the first place you go to on your first day back?"
3160.68,3165.08," Why didn't go there because like I missed it. And you know, I couldn't wait. I needed something"
3165.08,3168.36," there, which is why you go to a 99. And I said, what did you need there? Why did you need it? What"
3168.36,3171.8, did you need it? What I needed? What I needed was a cheap pair of sunglasses because I was about to
3171.8,3177.8," write my motorcycle into the office. And I didn't have any sunglasses. So I want, and in fact,"
3177.8,3183.0, I didn't have anyone I walked out of the store because I bought them. I walked to my bike and as I was
3183.0,3189.4," putting the things around my ear, one of the, one of the arms broke off, which is kind of a,"
3189.4,3194.92," you get what you pay for. It's great. Nice classes. Yeah. So it is, it's a good tip for"
3194.92,3201.32," because I used to get a 99 cent stores. Is there is an age between two and four years old,"
3201.32,3206.28, where kids can't tell the difference between a toy. They get an 99 cent store. And why you
3206.28,3211.48," for it from a toy store? Then you say, you just go in, you go, son, you take whatever you want. It's like"
3211.48,3215.88," he's like a prince. Oh, yeah. It's just five and above the learning that the whole skin is"
3215.88,3221.6400000000003," great. Not, not red or whatever it is at the 99 cent store. Well, that's the all thing about like,"
3221.6400000000003,3225.96," you know, you buy your kids at that age, at that young age, and they'll play with the box more"
3225.96,3229.96," than the kid. Yeah. There's some things you can say as you're in there, no man. Do you want your kids?"
3229.96,3236.12," What if that stuff is made with lead? Let's be responsible, really? I'm the guy who let's"
3236.12,3241.08, my kid fight battlefield bad company at five. I've left responsibility behind. Yeah. But you just
3241.08,3246.52," got, you had him shoot the building? Yeah. It was it. Yeah. Just shoot the building. I think he's not actual people."
3246.52,3251.88," Not people. No, no, no, no. I've held survivors of trauma, I think. So what about the demon? Mario"
3251.88,3256.36," caught. He beats him really? Yeah, it's embarrassing. So is your wife cool with that? Like you guys"
3256.36,3260.7599999999998," playing Mario Kart together? Yeah, she's that kind of stuff. How about you gaming on your own? Is that"
3260.7599999999998,3267.48," something that you'll do like at night and does your wife frown on that? Um, she, that's generally an"
3267.48,3273.16," issue where if I go down to the study and there's a new PC game, I can't play on my laptop. She"
3273.16,3278.76," gets annoyed because she likes me upstairs at night. But if it's in our bedroom, playing a"
3278.76,3283.08," console game on the laptop, she's very happy. Also, it's the company. Yeah, it's a good thing. If you're"
3283.08,3288.28," there goofing out with the games, yeah, but you're in the same room as her, she's cool. Yeah, she doesn't"
3288.28,3293.32," she doesn't like the computer, basically becoming the other woman. This is a trouble with PC games."
3293.32,3296.92," So I heard this again and again, Robert actually talks about the same thing, you know, when"
3296.92,3301.32," we got, we got him into PC games, it's like you could be, I don't know, you're more accessible."
3301.32,3304.92," If you're sitting on the couch looking at the TV, yeah, then if you're just in your own world with"
3304.92,3308.36," the pair headsets on screaming at people in the intro or something in the computer, I mean,"
3308.36,3312.84, then it's really like turning your back on someone. But she got into Metal Gear Solid 4.
3312.84,3317.64," She was in it. She was, she started off with like, what the hell is this plot? Because she was just"
3317.64,3322.52," listening to it constantly going on and on and then we both kind of got into it. Like, we're like,"
3322.52,3327.56," I really want to know what happened. I'm really, so, well, that's a victory. The whole thing."
3327.56,3330.52," That's great. So you watch you play the whole thing? Yeah, yeah, she liked that. What she"
3330.52,3334.92," said is fight with the ending, too. Oh, boy, there's, yeah, I've been played yet. All right."
3334.92,3338.7599999999998, No spoiler. Did she like the whole bit about turning a 1 to a 0 or the 0? We turned a 1 if
3338.7599999999998,3347.0," you didn't turn a 0 to 0. That's the, the other game was the, uh, change in the, to a non-spot,"
3347.0,3352.04," the other game she liked was a grand theft order for because, uh, she liked, she was, she hated"
3352.04,3355.24," the killing, but she was like, go on a date, go on a date. No, no, don't dress that way."
3355.24,3359.32," She wanted me to dress up. She was giving you dating tips. Well, she was giving Nico"
3359.32,3364.6," dead in touch because as we know, it wasn't, did she like the Sims? No, doesn't like it."
3364.6,3369.0, How did she feel when she found out that then Nico's dates would basically respond to anything
3369.0,3372.92," as long as it was new, no matter what it was. I think that's a little game of secret."
3372.92,3378.7599999999998," I think you didn't like that, you know, that really isn't. So it's like, no, no, we, we built"
3378.76,3383.0800000000004," up a relationship. Yeah. I'm, I sort of was really cool that you could go on a date"
3383.0800000000004,3388.6800000000003," in Grand Thaft Auto for and go on watch a, uh, Rikip Jivey's. Yeah, the stand up content. I mean,"
3388.6800000000003,3392.84," I was like, cool moment. And I was like, yeah, I felt like I mean, there was fun. Like, I was"
3392.84,3396.0400000000004, dating a blind chick though because I would head up basically the equivalent of like the
3396.76,3400.36, Russian dollar only store and I would grab shit without looking at it. Which one's the
3400.36,3403.7200000000003," white, which one's the blind chick? Well, it's not really, I would like to be, I would"
3403.72,3408.68," just, we blind when I got in the car wearing like this, but clown outfit of red and"
3408.68,3412.12," shit I grabbed in the hurry. She's like, oh, nice new shoes. Nice,"
3412.12,3417.24," ding, nice new jacket. Ding, nice new shirt. Oh, but I do like the big, big, big, big. If you"
3417.24,3421.8799999999997," didn't change though, yeah, like that, that she would comment on it if you didn't. She knew it."
3421.8799999999997,3426.3599999999997," Right. The car, the steel car, like, steel car with her in the car and then she'll"
3426.3599999999997,3431.9599999999996," compliment me on the new car. Which I can't remember what, would they, would she say anything"
3432.04,3436.12," if you jack the car and funner for? I can't remember now. Not when I dated it, that was the thing"
3436.12,3439.2400000000002," I was complaining about. I mean, this isn't it picking, but yeah, it's like I took her on a date"
3439.2400000000002,3443.2400000000002," and this is the very same one where she was saying, you know, I'm worried about your connections,"
3443.2400000000002,3447.0," you know, I don't like, you know, violent people and stuff and on that same date, I took her"
3447.0,3451.4," into like, you know, to chicken house and beat the shit out of like everyone in the fucking"
3451.4,3455.88," mess. But there is a witness and got back in the car and then she's just like, I'm just glad you're"
3455.96,3466.76," a nice guy. I love the fact that some of them, I took one, one of the, Nico took one of the"
3466.76,3472.2000000000003, chicks to the strip club and she was appalled and but one of them was into it. Which I just thought was
3472.2000000000003,3478.6," in the area. Yeah, the nurse, she's onto it. She was like, you like her ladies? Wow, she was into it."
3478.6,3482.6," Yeah, she was into it. Spoilers, sorry. Did you dig your wife see you good at the strip club?"
3482.6,3488.36," No, that was a little game of time. She feels a lot of time for that scene. Yeah, she"
3488.36,3495.16," felt dirty about it. Oh, I did. I felt weird. Oh, scenes. I told them. I think about"
3495.16,3500.7599999999998, the podcast that I stopped playing GTA when I got to the mission where you basically had the
3500.7599999999998,3505.48," white battery burning the strip club because I, you know, usually my wife's home when I'm playing"
3505.48,3510.36," that and I just didn't, that was like everything bad all in one room, you know, the strip club"
3510.36,3514.04," and killing everybody was like, wow, I just don't need her to see me playing this. No, I was"
3514.04,3518.92," like an invalidate everything she hates. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that in front of my family. That"
3518.92,3523.32," would be after they've gone to bed. Yeah, I mean, the reason I love those games is so I can be the"
3523.32,3527.6400000000003," most evil person. Would you feel like, but the fact that you're waiting till after they go to bed,"
3527.6400000000003,3530.6800000000003," I mean, you feel like you're pulling like the issue of high society out from under the couch,"
3530.6800000000003,3535.96," or not, when everyone was tucked in for the night, you know, like, well, I mean, some of it's,"
3535.96,3540.1200000000003," you know, some of it is entertainment that you like. It's getting a good way. Yeah. It's"
3540.12,3544.7599999999998," it's not, it's not stuff. It's not my appropriate kids will get old. Nothing. You could say, hey,"
3544.7599999999998,3549.24," it's time to learn about some games. Yeah, I don't know whether I'd have a share that I would"
3549.24,3552.92, like it. You're confusing me now because I've got a door to as well. It's wrong. Yeah. I can't even
3552.92,3556.3599999999997," think about your anymore. No, it's just, it's just wrong. I'm moving to Antal,"
3556.3599999999997,3559.96," took a winch hit becomes a team. Well, that's weird. Like the way that it was breakdown,"
3559.96,3563.16," like Jeff, you got a daughter who played well on her craft. And personally, I mean, this is just,"
3563.16,3567.0," you know, specular. Sure. But I think I'd probably like be less concerned about my daughter,"
3567.96,3571.16," you know, when she was like 14 or something playing GTA, then I would have had her playing"
3571.16,3576.84," work craft. And that's because I'm a strong believer in people's ability to, you know,"
3576.84,3582.36," to differentiate, you know, you know, portrayal, you know, fantastic scenes from real ones,"
3582.36,3585.88," other than, you know, social past and people who have things, you know, wrong with the"
3585.88,3590.12, nearest psychology. And then also being in communication with real people who might be
3590.12,3593.64, predatory or who might just beat me in or whatever the case may be. When you're dealing with
3593.72,3597.64," other people, that's like it could be how well probably it's more dangerous playing how"
3597.64,3603.8799999999997," will hotel than it would be. I think for most right, I mean, it's funny, she's gotten a little"
3603.8799999999997,3610.3599999999997," older here now. I'm more concerned about that than I was back in, you know, when she was like 8 to 12"
3610.3599999999997,3615.24," and playing World of Warcraft or at Wendigy star playing, I guess around 10. Because, you know,"
3615.24,3620.2," there was more innocence involved there and just it wouldn't even have like crossed her mind,"
3621.08,3625.64," and she just had a good head on her shoulders all along about, you know, not talking to strangers"
3625.64,3632.4399999999996," quote unquote, whereas at 14 now, I would believe that she like most teenagers might be more"
3632.4399999999996,3638.12, susceptible to some shifty kind of thought. The virtual equivalent of making your daughter where
3638.12,3642.3599999999997," like a long dress or like, you know, back you pants or something, that's make her role male characters"
3642.3599999999997,3649.0," and every MMO. Yeah, you know, I don't know if you're kidding or not, but actually that that"
3649.16,3656.44," you have to be a dude. Yeah, I got to be a troll. Why? Yeah, or a troll female would be fine."
3656.44,3661.88," Yeah, they're pretty ugly, but but actually, I mean, she sees out of it anyway. So see follow the"
3661.88,3666.28," standard teenage demographic, which I'm sure Rod, you have studies on this and maybe it's"
3666.28,3673.16, different for your own franchise. But but when she hit 13 gaming stopped being really kind of part of
3673.24,3679.0," her life and she got way more into just social networking shit. So for her, it's all"
3679.64,3684.92, Facebook and my space and instant messaging and all that. So it's still game a little bit with me
3684.92,3688.7599999999998," but for the most part, she's out of it. That's why Rod's been working on integrating"
3688.7599999999998,3696.12," Facebook with in my space with the Sims. No, it's actually the, that is our main competition."
3696.12,3701.0," I mean, it's funny. Most of the time when I get asked about competition with the Sims, it's"
3701.08,3709.16," now what game and really it ain't, it's generally social networking. It's what hits us the hardest."
3710.6,3716.12," Not on racing games for the same. Oh, yeah, yeah. The same boys that are like keeping half of your"
3716.12,3720.52, games and your business division of float are the ones taking away your audience and Sims.
3721.16,3722.92, Right. When Jeff's daughter hits that age.
3724.92,3729.32," Yeah, but she's not interested in the Sims really either right. The interesting boys,"
3729.4,3735.0800000000004," one of them saying, I'm always around that mice face. We can't. Yeah, we're not. I don't want to think"
3735.0800000000004,3739.88," about them. Yeah, now. We gotta know she has a nice effect. No, she's gotta be realistic here."
3740.6000000000004,3746.04," No, we don't have to be real. No. We got to dance here. We don't. Yeah. Trust me."
3746.04,3751.0800000000004," But I'm just gonna stay in denial. You know, I was thinking for a while there at the risk of"
3751.0800000000004,3755.1600000000003," oversharing for a while when she was when she was younger. I was thinking, you know, I really hope"
3755.72,3759.96, they were all guys here. So we can do it up at this. I'm really hoping that she might just be gay
3760.52,3767.7999999999997," because because I think, you know, guys fucking suck. You know, we do as far as women go. We suck."
3767.7999999999997,3773.48," You know, we don't treat them right most of the time. You know, we don't respect them. We'll"
3773.48,3778.44," dump their ass for somebody like better luck in as soon as they especially in teenage years. You know,"
3778.44,3782.68," this is like, it's like a bad scene back then. Guys are just boys are just fucking stupid."
3783.64,3787.08," And I was like, I don't want my daughter to have to go through that shit. If she just gay,"
3787.48,3791.48," she'll just maybe she'll just hook up with some nice girl and now like be, you know,"
3792.04,3796.68," like, you know, lesbian nerds together. And I would have to worry. I can go to bed at night,"
3796.68,3801.56," you know, at 11. You can see some Kevin Smith movies where he breaks down the types of"
3801.56,3806.2," lesbian. See, this is the problem. No, this is what I realized over time. It's like,"
3806.2,3810.2," what shit actually girls suck, too. Yeah. And she'll get hardbroken no matter what,"
3810.4399999999996,3816.04," you know, show fun, love with some, you know, whatever. You know, yeah. I think you're just being a dad."
3816.04,3820.04," Like, I mean, because you, you probably are thinking back to high school. You probably weren't like,"
3820.04,3824.8399999999997," oh, yeah. And I dumped like this chick because like her. Oh, no, no, I was, I was, I was probably like,"
3824.8399999999997,3829.56," those bitches, like, like, I wasn't good enough just because I was 15. They had to go and date that 21 year old."
3829.56,3833.56," Because you can get them boost easier. Like, I mean, I wasn't that no matter how you cut it, there's like,"
3834.12,3839.72," guys and girls just people do people do rock, rotten shit. Right. I was playing day and day."
3840.52,3844.8399999999997," That was my teenage. Yeah. I was playing day and day and world games. That was,"
3845.72,3851.16," yeah, I wasn't an asshole to be a half of a spying. I got a level on Hill, you know, war board games."
3851.16,3856.12," So yeah, girls weren't really in the picture. Yeah. Now, I think it would make sense for me."
3856.12,3861.24," There was that time when I was like, I didn't play so many games. But there was some that made it"
3861.24,3866.8399999999997," through there that like Street Fighter II was always, you know, there's always time to brodo"
3866.92,3875.4," some Street Fighter. I do remember, do you remember, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to look at,"
3875.4,3878.6800000000003," I'm going to look at Jeff because I think YouTube guys are too young to remember,"
3878.6800000000003,3882.6800000000003," which is sad for me to say, but you remember they were like two C. S. Isn't a row"
3883.0,3887.96," where it was just Street Fighter clones. Yeah. And that was, they were sad times. It was like,"
3887.96,3892.6800000000003," oh, a coin out. No, the arcade at that era. Oh, and I was a whole kind of few of them as well. And it was like,"
3893.24,3896.9199999999996," it's a fighting game, you know, did you hack Fighters history? No, I designed a game called"
3896.9199999999996,3903.24," brutal, Paul's a Fury. Oh, God. And I thought that my, uh, you remember it, God, I'm sorry."
3903.24,3908.7599999999998," Anyway, but yeah, I thought with Rise of the Robots, somebody made a remake of it, which I was just like"
3908.7599999999998,3912.7599999999998, awesome. You could have picked it better game. It was through the music. I guess was good. But
3912.7599999999998,3919.08," that my, I thought that, uh, they kind of fighting game about, uh, animals on a journey to Zen"
3919.08,3925.3199999999997," Spuro, Twin Lighten was like a market show, five thing. Yeah. I had the Dalai Lama, who was like a"
3925.3199999999997,3933.16," real Lama. Really? Yeah. And, uh, she had been designed and like, uh, read the rat cards for us. It was so good."
3933.16,3939.64, It was so good. It was great. The character was called Dalai Lama. Yeah. L-A-M-A. Yeah. Wow. And he was a
3939.64,3944.84, real Lama. I can't agree. Yeah. It was very sponsored by the Chinese government. Your whole project was
3944.92,3951.88," funded. Yeah. Yeah. Who else was, I was Kung Fu Cheetah. He was, he was one, I think. And,"
3952.6800000000003,3957.88," read the rat and, oh, I've been the bear because it's not a cliche to have Russians associated"
3957.88,3963.08," with bears. So when you were doing this at the time, right, did it seem cool to you or did you know"
3963.7200000000003,3970.84," I, you were kind of slumming. Um, I, so the, the thing I regret most about it and, uh, is it's funny"
3970.92,3976.2000000000003," looking back, I don't regret a lot of games that's so badly or got panned because I knew I did my best."
3976.2000000000003,3979.96, The thing that really bummed me about brutal was I know I didn't do my best because the original
3979.96,3987.48," design was, um, I wanted to have a huge, um, scrolling screen and you started like, you could"
3987.48,3991.8," basically fight your way through the entire castle. Kick and people, you remember, um, an old Commodore"
3991.8,3998.04," game called, um, uh, Bruce Lee where you kick people off and like you kick the, the guy off the"
3998.12,4003.8," ledges. It was meant to be that, but on a huge, like, multi-screen play field and eventually I,"
4003.8,4006.92," like, was working through, I couldn't figure out the design problems when it saw it,"
4006.92,4012.2799999999997," it will just copy Street Fighter, um, which is harder than it looks because it turns out Street"
4012.2799999999997,4017.32," Fighter is a really, really good design. There's a lot of death to it. And so I really regret it"
4017.32,4021.88," because I, I just, were you talking about? Did you think you were even like up to spec with like clay"
4021.96,4027.7200000000003," fighter or like, check food? Well, check food, you know, that's, that's pretty tough competition."
4028.52,4032.6800000000003," At that, at the time, I think, I think I knew that it was, well, I, I did, I knew it was like,"
4032.6800000000003,4037.88," you know, that wasn't my best. That, therefore, every bad review hurt and every good review,"
4037.88,4042.36," I didn't feel, was there, was there, like some sincere intention to take and spin off some of"
4042.36,4047.7200000000003," those characters in the platformers? You know, like the whole tie, the test mainly tiger and"
4047.72,4053.08," like arrow the acrobaton. No, we would have. I mean, it's, it's so good, um, and we could have done"
4053.08,4059.16," a sequel, but I was just so, I just felt guilty about it. Yeah, you know. I'm sure that's"
4059.16,4062.7599999999998," certainly your, your guys work as if you've done your best, it doesn't matter if I'm a bit"
4062.7599999999998,4066.3599999999997," trashy as it, because you're like, I know I did my best, I'm really proud of it. But even if"
4066.3599999999997,4071.64," something sells good, if you know you didn't do your best, you're like, yeah, now that's a good point."
4071.64,4077.0," I, if I, if I've done something that I feel like not up to speed and then people call me on"
4077.16,4082.84," it online. Well, even if I say good thing about worse. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, if it fills worse if"
4082.84,4087.72," they call you on it, I actually feel good to say people like it. If people like it, you know, I feel"
4087.72,4092.12," guilty of that. I'm like, yeah, could have been really, was there like a fan club for the game?"
4092.12,4097.96," I don't know. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I've, I've, I've done some talks of, um,"
4098.68,4104.36," universe that is, is usually one or two hands that go up like, hey, I played that game. I'm really"
4104.36,4109.0," hoping it's nostalgia talking. You're had some roped or sleeve and you see a tattoo that, no,"
4109.0,4113.639999999999," no, no, no, no, no, the guy, the guy, the guy, although the guy who programmed the rematch,"
4113.639999999999,4118.759999999999," you know, if he listens, thank you. He's very nice of you. The remakes better than the original game,"
4118.759999999999,4122.679999999999," so I think he fixed some game play issues. How, how would you feel if you turned out that"
4122.679999999999,4127.08, that person didn't have a big tattoo on one of the characters? I would think that's fantastic.
4127.08,4131.48, The coolest thing in the world is that Dali Lama himself had a Dali Lama tattoo.
4131.48,4135.879999999999," Dali, all right. Or you turned out that he was a big fan. Yeah. Yeah. He was like blessing to you."
4135.879999999999,4141.639999999999," The damn of the enemy? Yeah. That would be all right. Was it Dali like DLL, LL, I like Dali Lama?"
4141.639999999999,4150.28," No, it was, yeah, D, L, I. It was like the paint. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, I think that's, that's all we got."
4150.28,4154.839999999999, That's the end. Yeah. Dali Lama. Yeah. We could actually go on if it wasn't for me and my

4229.879999999999,4234.759999999999, I don't think there's any situation where you can legitimately blame your mom for starting off by
