0.0,5.76, Come with us to the high-bordian age.
5.76,10.92, Come with us back to the dark centuries which sprawl between the sinking of Atlantis and
10.92,12.96, the dawn of recorded time.
12.96,19.04, To the days when the now forgotten land of Equilonia was the mightiest of nations.
19.04,23.44, And the man's life was worth no more than the strength of his sword arm.
23.44,29.48," Come with us to the raw, untamed world of Conan, the barbarian."
29.48,35.16, I am there with you.
35.16,37.16, I hurt my own ears with that.
37.16,40.92," I can keep reading, but that's the place of hello and welcome."
40.92,41.92, Yeah.
41.92,42.92, Come with us now.
42.92,43.92, That's our sigma and GFW radio.
43.92,45.92, So you start talking about the age of Conan?
45.92,46.92, Yep.
46.92,51.760000000000005," The podcast for May 20th, say sad and the 8th."
51.760000000000005,55.84," One of those two, 8th."
55.84,60.760000000000005, And then I do ask you press release says that Conan is one of the top selling PC games
60.760000000000005,61.760000000000005, of all time.
61.760000000000005,64.12," Or is it more 400,000?"
64.12,65.48," The fast, I heard that number."
65.48,66.48," 200,000."
66.48,68.48, Pretty damn good.
68.48,69.48, That worldwide.
69.48,70.48, I assume.
70.48,71.48, I do.
71.48,76.56," But I mean, still that's better compared to like, I'm no vanguard or any of those other"
76.56,78.96000000000001, and my most privileged and like the last couple of years.
78.96000000000001,83.84," Yeah, I mean, they're already every time I log on, there's like a new notice that"
83.84,87.68," these new servers have been added or continuing to add servers based on demand, consider"
87.68,92.0," switching to a less populated server as opposed to, you know, auto assault."
92.0,93.4, I'm not sure I'm happy to hear that.
93.4,95.64," I mean, I'm not, but yeah, I don't think it's true."
95.64,99.56, I think it's telling that like we're proud to announce we've consolidated down to two servers.
99.56,100.56, Yeah.
100.56,101.56, That's usually what the spin is like.
101.56,102.80000000000001, I did know it's a good thing.
102.80000000000001,106.28, Telling that like every person I know that I used to play wow with is now all playing
106.28,107.28, Conan.
107.28,108.28, Like yeah.
108.28,109.28," Yeah, they all switched."
109.28,111.56," I mean, they're keeping their counts open on wow."
111.56,114.96000000000001," There's no way they, after like reaching level 70 and stuff, they'd close it, but they're"
114.96000000000001,117.92," definitely like trying out, well, I mean, it's drawn."
117.92,120.72," Conan is the, it's the MMO of the moment."
120.72,121.72, Yeah.
121.72,122.72, I guess.
122.72,123.72, Right.
123.72,125.64, I didn't notice any lesser numbers in our guild.
125.64,127.68, I know all come up with people are trying it out.
127.68,128.68, A couple of people.
128.68,130.68, No one's really migrated yet.
130.68,132.88," Every time I've tried to log on, the servers have been down."
132.88,134.68, That's no good.
134.68,135.68," It's, yeah."
135.68,136.68, It does have its fair share bugs.
136.68,140.68," I mean, it crashes on me sometimes, but I'm not saying I'm not making a judgment."
140.68,142.76000000000002," Actually, it was trying to play and I couldn't."
142.76000000000002,144.48000000000002, That's a bummer because we've been playing quite a bit.
144.48000000000002,148.56," I have to say that I need to amend my, my take on the game from last week."
148.56,154.68," Last week, I was, I wasn't like bitching and complaining so much as I was, I just wasn't"
154.68,160.36," as impressed with the whole combat and just seeing that the game was, was that much different"
160.36,161.76000000000002, than any other MMO I played.
161.76000000000002,162.76000000000002, And I don't know.
162.76000000000002,166.16," I think over the weekend, over the long weekend, I had time to continue to grind"
166.16,170.64000000000001," away and then certain things, you know, get a quite, you know, as I ranked up, I got"
170.64,173.92, a new more complex combos and could use those different ways.
173.92,176.55999999999997," And I started liking it and I hit the point where I was like, yeah, I'm going to keep"
176.55999999999997,177.55999999999997, playing.
177.55999999999997,179.88," And so I think I'm Friday and it up, poop sock and toe-up, two AMs."
179.88,180.88, Wow.
180.88,181.88," And then, wow."
181.88,186.76," I took the next day off, but I think that day after that, I played toe-up, two AM, yet"
186.76,187.76, again.
187.76,188.76, Wow.
188.76,194.39999999999998," So we got out of the beginner's area where we're now in the open, you know, we're again,"
194.39999999999998,200.11999999999998," we, you know, I mean, my usual gang of idiots and myself included."
200.12,204.16, And we're in the tyranny free for all PvP server.
204.16,207.48000000000002," And so what happens is after you get out of the beginning area, I don't know the names"
207.48000000000002,208.48000000000002, the season or anything.
208.48000000000002,210.84, I don't know what any character city is taught to or Taj.
210.84,214.68," Yeah, I had a tortage because I mean, any time someone gives me a quest, they just hit,"
214.68,215.68, I just mash one.
215.68,216.68," Yeah, to get there."
216.68,218.48000000000002, I don't want to read what they have to say.
218.48000000000002,219.48000000000002, I don't want to listen.
219.48000000000002,222.16, Someone spent a lot of time on that lore.
222.16,223.16, They did.
223.16,224.16, Or did they?
224.16,225.16, Yeah.
225.16,226.16, It's a good point.
226.16,227.16, I've typed in all that lore.
227.16,229.92000000000002," I mean, yeah, there's only voices for the first city in the, after that, there's"
229.92,230.92, no voices for the character.
230.92,231.92, Is that right?
231.92,232.92," Yeah, ever?"
232.92,233.92," Oh, really?"
233.92,234.92, Yeah.
234.92,235.92," Yeah, there's just like, it doesn't seem right."
235.92,238.92," So someone will be talking, you see all this text on the screen looks like."
238.92,239.92, Mm.
239.92,240.92, Mm.
240.92,241.92, Mm.
241.92,242.92, Mm.
242.92,244.92, It's barbarian language.
244.92,248.92," So, uh, oh, hey, before we go on, we never introduce ourselves."
248.92,252.92," Just we got to do that at, you know, oh, yeah, the professional, very, very true."
252.92,253.92, We're missing Ryan Scott today.
253.92,258.91999999999996," He's on vacation in Vegas, all things, which he wouldn't think, Ryan would be into,"
258.92,259.92, which is too bad.
259.92,261.92, Most of his associates don't Brian.
261.92,262.92, Ryan is a gambler.
262.92,263.92, He's a gambler.
263.92,264.92, Mm-hmm.
264.92,265.92, He's got that.
265.92,266.92," He's, he's compulsive about that."
266.92,268.92," Oh, he would be sort of the rein man sort of guy."
268.92,269.92, Don't you think?
269.92,270.92, Right.
270.92,271.92, Sitting there at the table?
271.92,272.92, Yeah.
272.92,273.92, Yeah.
273.92,274.92, Double down.
274.92,275.92, I believe he was a gambler.
275.92,276.92, Just split your eighties.
276.92,277.92, We're the eighties.
277.92,278.92, He's actually a gambler.
278.92,282.92," I figured he'd be like, oh, I'm going to the, like, the Star Trek experience."
282.92,283.92, Whatever.
283.92,284.92, Don't knock that.
284.92,286.92, I'm just saying I think he would go there.
286.92,287.92, He probably is.
287.92,288.92, Yeah.
288.92,290.92, I know he's also playing Blackjack.
290.92,291.92, Okay.
291.92,293.92, Did they let you play Blackjack and Star Trek in a form?
293.92,294.92," Oh, wow."
294.92,295.92, They call it something else.
295.92,297.92, I remember what's a Star Trek game.
297.92,298.92, Jump.com or something.
298.92,299.92, Dot.com.
299.92,300.92, But what?
300.92,301.92, I remember I saw it all.
301.92,303.92," Oh, I was like, cool."
303.92,304.92, It was a ghetto pool.
304.92,305.92, Space pool.
305.92,306.92, I want to play a lot of things.
306.92,308.92," I'll teach you to your chess, you know, a scene star Trek."
308.92,309.92, That looked like a fun game.
309.92,310.92, Yeah.
310.92,311.92, Yeah.
311.92,312.92, I think someone actually made it.
312.92,313.92, Made it.
313.92,314.92, Yeah.
314.92,315.92, Really?
315.92,316.92, Yeah.
316.92,317.92, Yeah.
317.92,318.92, That's a surprise meter.
318.92,319.92, Okay.
319.92,321.92," So no Ryan, but to my left is Anthony Gagos."
321.92,322.92, Sean.
322.92,323.92, Sean.
323.92,324.92, Below.
324.92,325.92, And Jeff.
325.92,327.92, I was just going to mention that now I'm no longer my cheat.
327.92,329.92, I'm actually now Ryan's minion.
329.92,330.92," Oh, yeah."
330.92,332.92, You're officially Ryan's minion?
332.92,333.92, Yeah.
333.92,334.92, Bravo.
334.92,335.92, Okay.
335.92,336.92, So I don't care that on your card.
336.92,337.92, Ryan's.
337.92,338.92, Yeah.
338.92,339.92, Minion.
339.92,340.92, That's a good.
340.92,342.92," I mean, that's not my cheat."
342.92,343.92," It's, it's got to be done."
343.92,348.92," It's a, it's super popular, but I mean, I mentioned it's hard work to do those super guides."
348.92,351.92, I still have to do one more before I'm officially off the hook.
351.92,355.92," Even though I'm technically Ryan's minion now battlefield, bed company."
355.92,356.92, Oh.
356.92,357.92, Yeah.
357.92,359.92," Well, the good news is the multipliers."
359.92,360.92," Oh, a lot of fun on that."
360.92,362.92," Yeah, but I'm pretty sure I have to do the single player too."
362.92,365.92, That's not much fun.
365.92,367.92, So I'm looking great.
367.92,368.92, Yeah.
368.92,369.92, All right.
369.92,370.92," Well, we talking about."
370.92,371.92, We're talking about age of counting.
371.92,372.92, Right.
372.92,373.92, Yeah.
373.92,374.92, So I don't know.
374.92,379.92," I mean, I can't just say it's just, you know, all of a sudden I understood the nuance of dodging and"
379.92,382.92," invasion and, you know, better combos and stuff."
382.92,386.92," I mean, because I was doing some of that before, but I don't know."
386.92,389.92, I think what's old you was when we first went to that white sands.
389.92,391.92," And it was me, you, Rory and Duncan."
391.92,394.92, And the four of us just started killing any person we saw.
394.92,398.92," I completely, and then the fact of the matter was that we found a group of people all"
398.92,405.92, three of them were like five levels hired us and we all killed them.
405.92,406.92, No problem.
406.92,407.92, Yeah.
407.92,409.92," It was like right then all of a sudden like, hey, you've been like, did you see how much damage"
409.92,410.92, I did to that guy?
410.92,412.92," I was like, I got a new one."
412.92,413.92, We got a new one.
413.92,414.92, That's the first sign.
414.92,415.92, Yeah.
415.92,416.92," I mean, it is cool too."
416.92,417.92, Yeah.
417.92,420.92," Because there's like, you'll do these fatality maneuvers every now and then."
420.92,424.92, And I think what determines is if your combo is naturally going to do enough to kill
424.92,426.92," them, it'll just finish it off with that."
426.92,430.92," But it's, it's kind of like, you know, back the old, you know, more combat too in the arcade."
430.92,434.92," When you know, it's a, you're even opponent as a little extra fun to it."
434.92,439.92," But, but I think it was beyond that when we started doing the quest like there was that one nice quest where"
439.92,442.92, you're going into that temple and there's those giant ball head of dudes in there.
442.92,444.92, And that's where Duncan was tracking.
444.92,447.92, We would see we're basically in this quest and we're in this party.
447.92,451.92," So any, anyone that was lone will think it would see us immediately stealth because they would"
451.92,454.92," be like, I don't want to risk dealing with them."
454.92,456.92, But then we had this Ranger and our group who can track.
456.92,463.92," And so we hunt this person throughout this dungeon as they're trying to, you know, do their quest and get to get the XP and get out of there."
463.92,465.92, And then that would be awesome.
465.92,470.92," And then it just makes it better when like, you know, then they start complaining and like the chat and the world chat."
470.92,472.92, Talk about watch out for this group of gankers.
472.92,475.92," The group is called P Norrange and that comes from a,"
475.92,477.92, so anyone's welcome to join.
477.92,481.92, We need a posse because we're basically just going to be like a mercenary guild.
481.92,483.92," Or I mean, and let us."
483.92,484.92, You're running a lot.
484.92,485.92, You're all pretty scared.
485.92,490.92," Yeah, free for all PVP and P Norrange comes from there's this picture on my, on my one up block of,"
490.92,496.92," I don't know, pretty creepy looking dude with a real doll and like a couch, but he's he's wearing like all orange."
496.92,501.92," And so the collar we did at some point we just say, well, that's P Norrange like Piner, a combination of Piner and orange."
501.92,503.92," So oh, okay."
503.92,504.92," That's, that's just know that."
504.92,505.92, That's what we are down.
505.92,507.92, But now it makes sense.
508.92,510.92," So I don't know the, the quest for getting better."
510.92,511.92," It's pretty, it's pretty fun to do."
511.92,514.9200000000001, So you're doing a quest as well as ganking.
514.9200000000001,518.9200000000001," Yeah, you have to, you have to level up to be able to fish our gank someone."
518.9200000000001,521.9200000000001," You can't level up from and it's just like as you're doing the quests,"
521.9200000000001,524.9200000000001, we end up going in dungeons where it is free for all areas.
524.9200000000001,530.9200000000001," So then like after the prerequisite Sean ordering us to stand by like the entrance for like five minutes,"
530.9200000000001,532.9200000000001, killing anyone who enters the choice to leave.
532.9200000000001,534.9200000000001, Then we move on and start doing the quest.
534.92,536.92, But you can't blame it on me.
536.92,541.92," We were playing and I saw a lone guy with this enormous mob of like, you know, demon bats and stuff,"
541.92,542.92, whaling on him.
542.92,545.92, So I ran up and like let's help this guy and Roy was nice.
545.92,547.92, That is not P Norrange.
547.92,549.92," Yeah, that's, that's what he's going on."
549.92,552.92, You do not help anyone.
552.92,556.92," He said you strayed with the, with the guild rules."
556.92,558.92," Yeah, we helped no one."
558.92,563.92, Basically all of you all are killed exist for is to add to the kill on sight list.
563.92,566.92, That's like all of you and does like up this skilled no kill on sight.
566.92,567.92, Right.
567.92,569.92," I think we have a, you have gotten that."
569.92,571.92, Do they have official like kill on sight stuff?
571.92,572.92," Yeah, that's great."
572.92,573.92, We'll get there soon.
573.92,575.92," Like we, we, we'll do some other stuff."
575.92,578.92," Well, it gets interesting after you get out of tortage and you get to the wider world."
578.92,581.92," Then you can actually pee, pee outside,"
581.92,582.92, and separate three cities.
582.92,583.92, Yeah.
583.92,586.92," But other subsidies, you're, you're totally free to kill."
586.92,590.92, So you'll just go and wait for someone to go to turn into quest and they're standing there talking
590.92,593.92, to a quest giver and I'll come behind them stealth.
593.92,594.92, Because I'm an assassin.
594.92,596.92," I'll just slit their throat, do a fatality."
596.92,600.92," And then you wait, you cloak again and they just keep trying to turn the quest in to get the XP."
600.92,601.92, Yeah.
601.92,603.92, You cut their throat every time they do it.
603.92,605.92, But that's called corpse camping.
605.92,606.92, Yeah.
606.92,607.92," Well, yeah."
607.92,608.92, That's a wild technique.
608.92,609.92, It gets pretty bad in this.
609.92,612.92," But one thing that is kind of cool that they do that is that,"
612.92,615.92," Rory, because Rory already has like a level 50 character."
615.92,616.92, He can apprentice us.
616.92,619.92," And so when he apprentice us, we become like one level less than him."
619.92,621.92, Even though like I'm 21.
621.92,622.92," Oh, great."
622.92,623.92, This is a me side kick.
623.92,624.92, Yeah.
624.92,625.92, He practises me up to 49.
625.92,626.92," Oh, that's neat."
626.92,627.92, And so my health doesn't go up.
627.92,633.92, But I get like I can attack 40 like a guy's 49 and it's not hard for me to hit him and stuff like that.
633.92,640.92," This is, this is the other thing I think what I liked about it is that every class in this game feels overpowered in the best ways."
640.92,643.92," Is that when you're playing, you're always like, I mean, like I was saying, I was like, dude,"
643.92,644.92, you see how much damage I did?
644.92,646.92," Everyone's always like, whoa, did you see what I just did?"
646.92,647.92, Did you see what I did?
647.92,650.92," No one, it seems like every one of us picked different type of class."
650.92,655.92, And at the same time we're all like happy and excited with what we have until they nerf you.
655.92,657.92," And yeah, one, there is one class."
657.92,659.92, What does it mean to set the priest of Metra?
659.92,661.92, I thought it was the tempest of set.
661.92,666.92," No, the priest has like got some real buggy shit that I've seen videos of."
666.92,672.92," But um, so are you getting, if you're getting a little more point behind this?"
672.92,673.92, Yeah.
673.92,674.92, Yeah.
674.92,678.92," But I'm like, what, what I was just gonna ask about the ganking."
678.92,683.92," I mean, to me that I was always in Wow and in other MMOs."
683.92,689.92," When you're rolling on a PVP server, you have foregoed the right to complain about being"
689.92,690.92, ganked.
690.92,691.92, Right.
691.92,692.92, Right.
692.92,693.92, You popped it into this part of the game as something.
693.92,694.92, Yeah.
694.92,696.92," And you should always, I mean, the thing is, I have to admit I would be guilty of a two."
696.92,700.92," Every once in a while in Wow, I would get ganked so much in like,"
700.92,704.12, I would finally do some kind of chat in the song.
704.12,706.16," It's like, fuck, these goddamn gankers."
706.16,707.88, I got just loose my temper and do that.
707.88,709.38," And then it would be like, you could have"
709.38,710.88," drawn a different server, dude."
710.88,713.0799999999999, Which is what I would always say to people who complained
713.0799999999999,714.16, when I heard them doing this.
714.16,716.5999999999999, This is the point that ties back into that is that
716.5999999999999,719.8399999999999," unlike World of Warcraft, you can kill,"
719.8399999999999,721.76," like I can be, you could be a level 12"
721.76,723.24, and kill the level 20.
723.24,724.8399999999999, You could be in PvP.
724.8399999999999,726.28," You could be like, we're 21 now"
726.28,729.24, and we could take on like 30 pluses and still win.
729.24,730.48, It's not like this.
730.48,733.08," What I don't play wow, but I'm going from all the people"
733.08,734.84, in the server we play with have played wow
734.84,737.48," and they're like, if someone is like five classes above,"
737.48,738.72, you want to be able to kill the level.
738.72,740.36," The level of disparity is pretty high, I guess."
740.36,740.88, Yeah.
740.88,741.88, So this is a good thing.
741.88,742.88, So why is that?
742.88,744.24," I mean, does it just mean like,"
744.24,746.92, it's just because like getting off those combos and stuff
746.92,748.24, is like so much more of it.
748.24,750.44, Like if the person's just mashing their tech buttons
750.44,751.88," but never doing any combos because like,"
751.88,752.72, 40.
752.72,754.76," Well, a lot of this, but okay, what if you later"
754.76,757.6800000000001," in the game, the people learn how to do the combos?"
757.68,759.0799999999999," Yeah, if you're two of the people"
759.0799999999999,761.5999999999999," Matt, a vehicle skill, yeah, are going into it"
761.5999999999999,764.1999999999999, is the higher level will always have a advantage.
764.1999999999999,766.3199999999999," So yeah, just because he will have my hit points."
766.3199999999999,767.3199999999999," And so, okay."
767.3199999999999,770.16," And then, but if say there's two people say you have"
770.16,772.56," two level 20s against like a level 30,"
772.56,775.04, one or whatever and the level 31 is like really
775.04,777.04," competence, character, and it's going all out."
777.04,780.04, The lower levels can still beat them in numbers like that.
780.04,782.0," So the situation like you're saying Jeff,"
782.0,784.28," what people could do in that, it's like, yeah,"
784.28,787.28, you either go to another server or more
787.28,790.36," interestingly, you're forced to make alliances of your own."
790.36,792.76," Yeah, you're like, it's like the revenge of the nerds."
792.76,794.24," You know, like if you're always getting picked on,"
794.24,796.72, you just find the rest of the nerds and then they go
796.72,799.92, people did do that against us one time in a small town.
799.92,803.8399999999999," Yeah, well, it was like a chain because these people"
803.8399999999999,805.36," have this killed and in,"
805.36,808.48, victims were doing it and they were at the spawnstone
808.48,809.48, just killing everyone.
809.48,811.04," So I was like, let's get these guys."
811.04,814.24, So we did that and then we killed them and we let them
814.24,815.92, respond to kill them for about 20 minutes.
815.92,817.68," But then someone else, some other clan saw it,"
817.68,819.76, they came in and then they were trying to get us.
819.76,822.36, And then pretty soon it was like the whole area.
822.36,824.56, It was just this enormous free for all.
824.56,825.0799999999999, Yeah.
825.0799999999999,828.4, But you see like how the alliances and the friendships come into play
828.4,829.4799999999999," were like, you know, there was,"
829.4799999999999,830.56," I don't know if you were there, but Anthony,"
830.56,833.4," there's a level 70 came through and a mastered on and we were like,"
833.4,836.24," whoa, it was like big game in more ways than one."
836.24,838.4799999999999," So we were like, let's go, you know, immediately,"
838.4799999999999,841.5999999999999," we went and we killed them and it was, it was rad."
841.5999999999999,844.36," It was like, you know, David took down Goliath and then immediately"
844.36,847.72, after you start seeing people at the same clan tag appearing one
847.72,849.24, after another after another.
849.24,850.28, And then they were all there.
850.28,852.5600000000001, We were just like in the hills like hiding watching them.
852.5600000000001,854.96," We're like, well, and then they have to"
854.96,858.0, really find us and then they just left to.
858.0,861.24, I guess the difference that I see like as far as like between like
861.24,864.52," wow, ganking and Conan ganking is like, when we go in his own,"
864.52,867.64, a lot of times his zones are like really cord or focused.
867.64,870.88, So all your question are going to take you into the same rooms.
870.88,872.84," So it's not like in Stranglet or in Veil where like,"
872.84,875.0," you're like, I don't know killing gorilla's and you're like,"
875.0,875.6800000000001, I'm getting ganked.
875.6800000000001,878.5600000000001, So I'm going to go all the way over the other side and kill like tigers.
878.5600000000001,880.4," Like in this one, if you're getting ganked in there,"
880.4,881.52, you pretty much just have to leave.
881.52,883.76," Oh, like it's not like you just moved to someplace else."
883.76,885.2800000000001, You've been just go level somewhere else.
885.2800000000001,885.64, Right.
885.64,885.84, Right.
885.84,889.48, It's you could chase people or long distances to where you can change
889.48,890.48, instances too.
890.48,892.44," I guess because they're like, you can like,"
892.44,895.32, click your tab and you can go to a different instance of the same version
895.32,897.12, of the thing and hope there's less people there.
897.12,899.12, It's some areas that have that option.
899.12,900.32, Others don't.
900.32,902.44," Then there's what did you call it, spawn dancing?"
902.44,903.44, Okay.
903.44,906.36," I said, yeah, I said zone zone dancing."
906.36,907.5200000000001," Yeah, the words like that."
907.5200000000001,910.6, People will go through a door where it causes you to load.
910.6,912.36, And then so like we start to beat someone.
912.36,914.1600000000001," They run to the nearest door and then it's like,"
914.1600000000001,916.4000000000001, you have to chase them and you have to load through the door.
916.4000000000001,919.2, So then we just split our group into two and wait on either side of the door
919.2,920.2, and he would zone dancing.
920.2,921.2, He's coming back.
921.2,922.6800000000001," So he come out the door and get in the head,"
922.6800000000001,925.48," go back to the door, get hit in the head again."
925.48,929.08, It's still getting ever crushed flashbacks there.
929.08,930.08," Yeah, exactly."
930.08,931.08, Exactly.
931.1600000000001,933.12," Yep, the nose are still there."
933.12,934.12, I'm going back.
934.12,935.12," Yeah, nose haven't left."
935.12,936.12, Yeah.
936.12,938.12, It's just a PBP type of.
938.12,943.84, I was kind of excited about the really high level stuff because it sounds interesting.
943.84,947.64," But now the Rory and them as they're, you know, on their main characters, they're getting"
947.64,952.72, closer and closer to like the level ceiling and they seem to be frustrated with some
952.72,953.72, things.
953.72,958.1600000000001," But first of all, the promising stuff on papers that you can get, you basically build"
958.16,960.76, this town or something for your guild.
960.76,965.28, And then what you have to do is you designate certain days when it can be attacked.
965.28,970.48," And so the longer the window is, the more you're going to get draw like resources or something"
970.48,971.48, from it.
971.48,975.3199999999999," So if you're like Monday through Wednesday, we're vulnerable to attack."
975.3199999999999,980.6, You're going to get more than if you say we're only attackable for like three hours on Friday.
980.6,985.16, So then the trade-off then is that you have to have a big guild and they have to be there
985.16,989.24, on those days when you're vulnerable because other guilds that will come and raise your
989.24,993.16," city, they'll try to like, you know, come through with their rhinos and elephants and basically"
993.16,999.04," destroy and siege, do siege warfare on you and destroy your whole town."
999.04,1002.4399999999999," And that seems pretty interesting, but that'd be fun to destroy someone."
1002.4399999999999,1007.1999999999999," But if it's just like, I think what they're worried about is that since it's the specific"
1007.1999999999999,1012.0799999999999," time limits, it's like everyone will know you'll designate the time and you have all"
1012.0799999999999,1014.04, these poop soccer center like it's your job.
1014.04,1015.04, They look at it like a job.
1015.04,1018.64," Like instead of going to seven, like in the work line to five, yeah, you got to punch it and"
1018.64,1019.64, defend the dumb town.
1019.64,1024.0," So it's like, and if you leave your town to attack, then other people have, you know,"
1024.0,1027.3999999999999, and I think that high end game is something that I didn't think we were really going to
1027.3999999999999,1031.08, go for anyways because I got the impression from Rory that our guild was going to be more
1031.08,1035.8799999999999, like on a contract basis to go attack towns for other people rather than trying on our
1035.8799999999999,1036.8799999999999, own towns to go.
1036.8799999999999,1037.8799999999999, I do.
1037.8799999999999,1038.8799999999999," So I mean, keep you up the clock too."
1038.8799999999999,1039.8799999999999," Yeah, that's something to go."
1039.8799999999999,1040.8799999999999, Right.
1040.8799999999999,1041.8799999999999, Go and track killers.
1041.8799999999999,1042.8799999999999," Yeah, basically."
1042.8799999999999,1043.8799999999999, Yeah.
1043.88,1046.72, So someone like me was more into the PPE.
1046.72,1048.5200000000002," Like, is there anything here for that?"
1048.5200000000002,1050.5200000000002," Yeah, they're being talking about the PvP."
1050.5200000000002,1051.5200000000002," No, there's a ton of it."
1051.5200000000002,1056.0," But PvE and the quests, if you actually want to take the time to read them, they are"
1056.0,1057.0, interesting.
1057.0,1059.44, They're not totally just like the same thing over and over again.
1059.44,1063.24, And do you think more of the draw right now is the PvP though?
1063.24,1064.24, Sure.
1064.24,1065.24, Sounds like it's the same.
1065.24,1068.64," Well, at least on a, if you're going to plan a free for all, it certainly seems"
1068.64,1069.64, that way.
1069.64,1071.64, I just wonder if the PvP servers filled up quickly.
1071.64,1072.64, Those are the ones that filled up.
1072.64,1073.64, I think people would be.
1073.68,1075.5600000000002," Yeah, they do like that."
1075.5600000000002,1076.5600000000002," Oh, man."
1076.5600000000002,1080.8400000000001, It did seem like the people who did want to leave while for this were the ones who were
1080.8400000000001,1084.5600000000002," the ones doing arenas and doing battlegrounds, so that kind of makes sense to me."
1084.5600000000002,1085.5600000000002, Yeah.
1085.5600000000002,1089.64," I mean, there's, like, yeah, there is a lot of PvE, but I guess if PvP really doesn't"
1089.64,1094.48," interest you at all, then it probably is kind of necessarily the bad."
1094.48,1095.48, The bad.
1095.48,1096.48, I like the opt-in.
1096.48,1097.48, That's all.
1097.48,1098.48, Yeah.
1098.48,1101.64, The bad news for me knows that this game hasn't learned from a lot of other MMOs that
1101.64,1105.3600000000001," have figured things out in the, in the, in the intervening years between, you know,"
1105.3600000000001,1106.3600000000001, everquest and stuff.
1106.3600000000001,1110.48," So it's like, you can share quests, but sometimes, you know, a lot of more like"
1110.48,1113.8000000000002," serial quests, you know, or chain quests, and then you can share that one."
1113.8000000000002,1114.8000000000002, Right.
1114.8000000000002,1116.88," And then there'll be like, we all have the same quest, and it's like to pick up some,"
1116.88,1119.76," like, scroll and item off a boss mob."
1119.76,1120.76, Yeah.
1120.76,1121.96, Or it doesn't drop it for everyone.
1121.96,1123.64, It only drops it for one person.
1123.64,1124.8400000000001, That was one of the things.
1124.8400000000001,1125.8400000000001," That's, wasn't it?"
1125.8400000000001,1126.8400000000001, That's dumb.
1126.8400000000001,1127.8400000000001, That sucks.
1127.8400000000001,1128.8400000000001, Sorry.
1128.8400000000001,1129.8400000000001, I didn't mean to interrupt.
1130.1599999999999,1130.84, Yeah.
1130.84,1133.6799999999998," Well, specific, it doesn't have to be a specific, there are sometimes it's just"
1133.6799999999998,1135.84, there's a scroll in the temple.
1135.84,1136.6799999999998, You don't have to kill anything.
1136.6799999999998,1137.4399999999998, It's just sitting there.
1137.4399999999998,1138.08, Right.
1138.08,1142.1599999999999, And then you all wait around and then Anthony goes and then I go and then Rory goes.
1142.1599999999999,1144.0, And we just wait for it to solve it.
1144.0,1145.0," Oh, because it despons."
1145.0,1146.0, And then comes back.
1146.0,1147.0, But you have to wait for it to spawn again.
1147.0,1148.0, Yeah.
1148.0,1149.0, Yeah.
1149.0,1150.0," I mean, so there's a lot of things like that."
1150.0,1151.0, Yep.
1151.0,1152.0, Just still.
1152.0,1156.8799999999999," Or if you did, I, or if you forget to share the quest, it's just the usual thing where,"
1156.88,1161.0800000000002," like, I found out there's that big bad demon up on the hill, up on some temple."
1161.0800000000002,1163.88," And it was like, I had already killed it three times before because it was a fun place"
1163.88,1164.88, to go gang people.
1164.88,1166.7600000000002," It, you have to wait for it to spawn."
1166.7600000000002,1170.0400000000002, So we go up there and hide and then run and go kill it before the people that were
1170.0400000000002,1171.88, waiting could kill it.
1171.88,1172.88, And then laugh.
1172.88,1175.48," But then I got my come up and it's because when then later on, I got this quest."
1175.48,1176.48," And I was like, kill the bad demon."
1176.48,1177.48," I was like, we already did that."
1177.48,1178.48, Right.
1178.48,1179.48," I go, he's back."
1179.48,1180.48, Yeah.
1180.48,1181.48," Oh, for you."
1181.48,1182.48, People waiting for you there.
1182.48,1184.3200000000002," The worst in a while, where I was, that's a court question."
1184.3200000000002,1186.8400000000001, You had like five people because you have to first turn it in.
1186.84,1189.84, And then everyone has to check in to make sure that they're turned in and on the same
1189.84,1190.84, step.
1190.84,1191.84," Like, everybody just started this every way to start this."
1191.84,1192.84, Right.
1192.84,1194.84," And then there's always negative one person was like, oh, I wasn't ready."
1194.84,1196.84, I didn't get the box to start it.
1196.84,1197.84, So slightly out of sync.
1197.84,1199.84, So then they had to do it all over again.
1199.84,1201.84," And then like, usually there's probably someone like coming."
1201.84,1202.84," So you're like, I'm shit."
1202.84,1204.84, I don't want them to get the system.
1204.84,1206.84," You know, because anyone can grab it."
1206.84,1207.84, Right.
1207.84,1209.84, They do you have to wait 15 minutes while they do it.
1209.84,1210.84, Yeah.
1210.84,1211.84, So that was always the worst in a while.
1211.84,1214.84," So I think, I mean, the whole time we're playing, right?"
1214.84,1217.84, It seems like that defines most of the experience with Quest.
1217.84,1221.84," I mean, it's like one thing after another like that where yeah, it's just some"
1221.84,1224.84, implausible and ridiculous impediment to getting through.
1224.84,1225.84," I mean, it's still fun."
1225.84,1228.84," But it's just like, I've seen Guild Wars solve those problems."
1228.84,1231.84," And I've seen, you know, tabular us a solve them."
1231.84,1236.84," So it's like, yeah, play the competition's games at least and learn what they do."
1236.84,1237.84, Right.
1237.84,1239.84," I mean, are there dungeons per se?"
1239.84,1240.84," Like, wow style dungeons."
1240.84,1241.84, Yeah.
1241.84,1242.84, Yeah.
1242.84,1246.84, Like instant lost crawls and stuns and you could do epic version of them.
1246.84,1248.84," Yeah, which we've never done."
1248.84,1249.84, Yeah.
1249.84,1250.84, Cool.
1250.84,1251.84, This call heroic.
1251.84,1252.84, It's wow.
1252.84,1253.84, Yeah.
1253.84,1254.84, They at least played Blizzard's game.
1254.84,1255.84, Yeah.
1255.84,1256.84, That sounds like they did.
1256.84,1257.84, That's a good idea.
1257.84,1258.84, But you do.
1258.84,1262.84," Just wondering when you're like at the level cap, you can go back to the old content and then they'll still be."
1262.84,1265.84," They patched that in recently, right?"
1265.84,1267.84, It's wowed it that post.
1267.84,1268.84, Burning crusade.
1268.84,1269.84, Yeah.
1269.84,1270.84, Post.
1270.84,1271.84, Yeah.
1271.84,1272.84, Yeah.
1272.84,1273.84, Yeah.
1273.84,1274.84, Maybe in two-one or maybe even.
1274.84,1275.84, Yeah.
1275.84,1281.84, The other controversy when you're talking about dealing with gangsters and stuff like us is that they're.
1281.84,1285.84," Already on their forum is talking about, you know, patches and how they're going to handle things."
1285.84,1287.84, And it's like there's this one proposed solution.
1287.84,1293.84," And that's if you go around killing people of a lower level than yourself, then they'll put you in the"
1293.84,1294.84, middle of this like jail thing.
1294.84,1297.84, And then you have to do shitty grind quests to get out.
1297.84,1300.84," So it would be like, you know, like kill a whole heart."
1300.84,1303.84, It's like community service.
1303.84,1307.84," Like road work, you know, the guys cleaned up the side of the road."
1307.84,1308.84, Yeah.
1308.84,1309.84, I don't know.
1309.84,1310.84, I think people would complain about that.
1310.84,1313.84," Oh, it just seems like part of the peel is that you can kill anyone."
1313.84,1314.84, Yeah.
1314.84,1315.84, It's better.
1315.84,1316.84, Think it out.
1316.84,1317.84, Let's see Sean last thing through the game very long.
1317.84,1319.84, If he ends up having to like kill 150.
1319.84,1320.84," Oh, yeah."
1320.84,1321.84, That's been all.
1321.84,1322.84, I want to make more safe areas.
1322.84,1329.84, They could take like the old EverQuest approach and have like guards in the town that would attack a person that initially is PVP or something like that.
1329.84,1332.84, That's how the NPCs will arrest you and they'll haul you off.
1332.84,1334.84, And then you have to have the rat killing question.
1334.84,1335.84, Yeah.
1335.84,1336.84, They likely theoretically maybe.
1336.84,1345.84," I would hope that they think it through though, because otherwise instead, what I'll just do is make another character and stay at a low level and I'll pick fights with every single high level."
1345.84,1349.84," First of all, and then just pester them and be killing me."
1349.84,1350.84, And then they'll cry.
1350.84,1353.84," Oh, he killed me."
1353.84,1356.84, And then hopefully the NPCs will come and take them away.
1356.84,1359.84, Why never really solved the problem either.
1359.84,1361.84," No, I mean, they tried to try and kill."
1361.84,1365.84, It counts like butcher bears or booty bear where it has like the guards.
1365.84,1370.84," But then when someone was like level 60, didn't matter, they could take hits from it long enough to kill you and you."
1370.84,1371.84, Yeah.
1371.84,1372.84, Yeah.
1372.84,1373.84, The dishonorable kills.
1373.84,1375.84," I mean, they got to do this pretty fast."
1375.84,1378.84," If you didn't care, then whatever."
1378.84,1379.84, You just have to know answer your parents.
1379.84,1380.84, Yeah.
1380.84,1383.84, If you want to be at deck in these games and PVP servers.
1383.84,1384.84, Yeah.
1384.84,1385.84," I mean, there is that philosophy too."
1385.84,1389.84," If you're on again, I free for all PVP server than just for convenience."
1389.84,1390.84, Be ready for it.
1390.84,1391.84, Yeah.
1391.84,1392.84," I mean, the length."
1392.84,1394.84, And then someday you will be able to gank.
1394.84,1395.84, Yes.
1395.84,1397.84, Then you can go to the low B zones.
1397.84,1398.84, And you can go to the low B zones.
1398.84,1399.84, And you can go to the end.
1399.84,1402.84," For the most part, you can stealth this like your friend."
1402.84,1405.84, Not every class is that great in hiding.
1405.84,1407.84," I mean, it's an excellent way if you're playing alone."
1407.84,1411.84, It's an essential way to avoid getting beat down even though every class of stealth.
1411.84,1415.84, Every class can hide and every class can also look for someone that is hiding as well.
1415.84,1417.84, But you're stats for it.
1417.84,1420.84," Like I'm in the sense, so my like stealth stats are like through the roof."
1420.84,1421.84, Yeah.
1421.84,1422.84, Max that out over everything.
1422.84,1423.84, And then also like perception.
1423.84,1425.84, And there are ways to find people who are hiding.
1425.84,1428.84, But like I'm hard to find even if people have high perception.
1428.84,1432.84," Because my, you know, my hiding sliders maxed out."
1433.84,1434.84," Um, hey, well, we're on this."
1434.84,1440.84, We got an interesting post from the age of Conan official forums.
1440.84,1442.84," I had Rory Ford, either."
1442.84,1444.84, So I don't have the posters name.
1444.84,1448.84," But um, that's his."
1448.84,1451.84, He's upset and says.
1451.84,1452.84, All right.
1452.84,1459.84, It's time for some feedback on something I consider as paramount importance for any world that wants people to quote unquote living it.
1460.84,1462.84, All right.
1462.84,1464.84," Um,"
1464.84,1469.84, Age of Conan fails to deliver an entire sexual orientation in the game failed to deliver as well.
1469.84,1472.84, Female characters with permondies and nipples.
1472.84,1481.84, Plus female NPCs in the world are absolutely rife with audience by a PG rated in UND that does not equal real sex in any way shape or form out here.
1481.84,1482.84, I'm sorry.
1482.84,1484.84, This is not real sex.
1485.84,1490.84, The sexual aspects of age of Conan are at best about as complex and offensive as milk toasts.
1490.84,1493.84," But hey, who can worry about sex?"
1493.84,1500.84, Because there's absolutely no situation in of which it would come up because I can't even dance much less to the lack of anyone.
1500.84,1505.84, And any more complex amount of than sticking my daggers into their back.
1505.84,1506.84," Yes, that's right."
1506.84,1508.84, I can't even dance.
1508.84,1510.84, The dances all caps.
1510.84,1515.84, In a world where I'm supposed to build cities and live in alternate violent sex in brutal life.
1515.84,1519.84, I can't even go to a tavern and sit down much less dance.
1519.84,1524.84, You can't drink even though you can fill yourself to the hill with any manner of consumables.
1524.84,1528.84, You can't arm wrestle their dance with other characters. Nothing.
1528.84,1530.84, I'm not going to.
1530.84,1532.84, Society and dancing.
1532.84,1535.84, So say me and my friends all get together in build a guild city.
1535.84,1537.84, What's there to do other than defend it?
1537.84,1539.84, We obviously can't live there.
1539.84,1543.84, We can't even sit down on any of it much less sit around the tavern and dance.
1543.84,1544.84, Which?
1544.84,1545.84, Which?
1545.84,1548.84, I'm telling tall tales of battles never fought.
1548.84,1550.84, That's about it.
1550.84,1551.84, That's about it.
1551.84,1552.84, Like dancing.
1552.84,1554.84, I think it all is not just keep going to the end.
1554.84,1556.84, I think I want to go back to the story.
1556.84,1559.84, This is a point he gets to next.
1559.84,1560.84, You saw it coming.
1560.84,1561.84, Okay.
1561.84,1562.84, So he goes that.
1563.84,1564.84, Great.
1564.84,1565.84, Too many.
1565.84,1567.84, They may look at my concerns and go.
1567.84,1572.84," Yeah, but what about how fast people are leveling and the broken zones and the performance issues?"
1572.84,1577.84, I will tell you right here and now that none of that is important in the long term.
1577.84,1578.84, And I can prove it.
1578.84,1584.84, Star Wars galaxies had what was probably the most horrendous release in the history of online gaming.
1584.84,1587.84, The client was never stable and never performed well.
1587.84,1589.84, Sorry dude.
1589.84,1594.84, It is like he's dropping out of here at the web where the voice.
1594.84,1598.84," But so then he just goes on to say that yeah, while Star Wars galaxies had all this shit."
1598.84,1604.84, It was this huge success in his mind because the social content was drastically important.
1604.84,1606.84, Because dancing was so good.
1606.84,1608.84," Yeah, that's why it's ways to dance."
1608.84,1610.84, It's got that need to sound dancing.
1610.84,1611.84, Dancing.
1611.84,1615.84, What's the point if you could take off your shirt and bury your breasts if you can't dance?
1615.84,1616.84, Yeah.
1616.84,1624.84, Did you figure it out if it's intentional or some kind of weird graphic bug in Conan or whenever you talk to a female and see their breasts?
1624.84,1628.84," Yeah, they're not like they're heating or they're winded or anything."
1628.84,1630.84, And they're not even moving up and down.
1630.84,1632.84, They're jerking side to side.
1632.84,1634.84, It's like a silent hill monster.
1634.84,1637.84, Graphical glitch physics air that they're like.
1637.84,1639.84, It's just like some of the boobs.
1639.84,1641.84, So I said the boobs move left to right.
1641.84,1642.84, They just twitch left and right.
1642.84,1644.84, They're like how like a silent hill monster.
1644.84,1646.84, I'm constantly in a cut scene or something.
1646.84,1647.84, Right.
1647.84,1649.84," You get that like yeah, wait for the fucking pyramid."
1649.84,1651.84, And this is only the female breasts.
1651.84,1652.84, Like basically guys.
1652.84,1654.84, There are some men that don't do that.
1654.84,1655.84, And but they don't jiggle.
1655.84,1656.84, No.
1656.84,1657.84, They didn't work that physics.
1657.84,1658.84, They don't.
1658.84,1659.84, I don't know.
1659.84,1660.84, I don't know.
1660.84,1661.84, Maybe someone's in.
1661.84,1664.84, But I can't believe they didn't build a dance key.
1664.84,1666.84," And seriously, how could that be the thing?"
1666.84,1671.84, I don't know if I haven't seen any emotes of any sort of thing in Conan and all.
1671.84,1674.84, Like just play second life if that's your thing.
1674.84,1677.84, Like what do you do when when you say you can hit slash dance.
1677.84,1679.84, And your character dances.
1679.84,1681.84," Well, then what the fuck is role playing?"
1681.84,1682.84, You just sit there and watch it.
1682.84,1683.84, Yes.
1683.84,1687.84, You sit there with your like 500 pound like excuse for a body.
1687.84,1690.84, Just drip it into your attention itself to the chair.
1690.84,1693.84, Just like dancing feels wonderful.
1693.84,1697.84, I have type slash dance plenty of times in a while.
1697.84,1699.84, But that's different.
1699.84,1703.84, Why is it the only reason you ever type slash dances when you're not when you're bored when you're bored.
1703.84,1704.84, When you're bored.
1704.84,1705.84, Yeah.
1705.84,1709.84," You're waiting for a break to start to like, let's slash dance and then people start to dance."
1709.84,1710.84, Right.
1710.84,1714.84, Or some people have magical flutes to dance when you're really in the role playing.
1714.84,1717.84, I have never seen anyone dance about not ironically.
1717.84,1720.84," It's like they're ever seen anyone actually say, let's dance."
1720.84,1723.84," And you want to just instead of just standing there, you like, I'm going to bathroom."
1723.84,1724.84, Right.
1724.84,1725.84, Yeah.
1725.84,1726.84, Dance.
1726.84,1727.84, To get idol animation and Mario.
1727.84,1728.84, Basically.
1728.84,1730.84, I liked playing music and Lord of the Rings.
1730.84,1731.84, That was different.
1731.84,1733.84, Because you can annoy people with it.
1733.84,1734.84, Exactly.
1734.84,1735.84, Just be with it.
1735.84,1737.84, Different form of not ganking but annoyance.
1737.84,1738.84, Yeah.
1738.84,1741.84, I would go out to people trying to have conversations because the music would be so bad.
1741.84,1745.84," You know, I'd be playing like really bad like Mary had a little lamb and there's"
1745.84,1746.84, You like go away.
1746.84,1747.84, Right.
1747.84,1748.84, Because you control over right.
1748.84,1749.84, I had my own notes.
1749.84,1750.84, It's like a whole scale.
1750.84,1754.84, They should introduce that element to Conan because then you could kill people while they're playing.
1754.84,1756.84," If you didn't like it, you could just go kill them."
1756.84,1757.84, But they do.
1757.84,1759.84," Oh, I would ask for handouts too."
1759.84,1760.84, I would play in the ask for money.
1760.84,1762.84, But they do have an audio.
1762.84,1765.84, Like a way you can audio assault people member.
1765.84,1768.84, Roy rolled up on his giant mastodon and just was mashing like this.
1768.84,1770.84," But there's something and it was just going like,"
1770.84,1771.84, Pfft.
1771.84,1773.84, You can hear it so far away.
1773.84,1774.84, Yeah.
1774.84,1779.84," And it's like, it's like some kind of a, it's not just like hitting the button to make it talk."
1779.84,1782.84," It was like some way you found a junkie out where you, because it's."
1782.84,1784.84, It was meant so you couldn't spam it.
1784.84,1788.84," But he found a way to swim in like, yeah, it's the most like grading noise you'll ever hear."
1788.84,1792.84, It's just dance combos like you have like five moves or whatever that you can learn.
1792.84,1794.84, And then you string him together in a certain way and you get a buff.
1794.84,1797.84," They have everyone looks at you and they're like, yeah, my attack just went up."
1797.84,1798.84, That can be a new class party.
1798.84,1799.84, That's what they make.
1799.84,1802.84, Did Star Wars goxies of anything like that?
1802.84,1806.84," That's like, well, half dead when Robert coffee when he comes on will have to."
1806.84,1808.84, I don't know if we've talked about it.
1808.84,1813.84," Not with him here, but he had a whole career as a, as a, as a dancer for money."
1813.84,1816.84," As far as I know, there was golf like in the tavern."
1816.84,1819.84, There was a whole tavern gameplay where like dance moves and.
1819.84,1820.84, Right.
1820.84,1821.84, That's right.
1821.84,1822.84, Terrible.
1822.84,1823.84, I don't know.
1823.84,1824.84, It was an awful idea.
1824.84,1826.84, But he had he had clients Robert.
1826.84,1831.84," He would like log in and his, his male clients would be awaiting him and his services."
1831.84,1833.84, And he made a fortune doing that.
1833.84,1836.84, That's worse in the second life.
1836.84,1838.84, And now it's like the same thing.
1838.84,1842.84," But in the Star Wars quarter of second life, but with no, with no, yeah, none of those special."
1842.84,1844.84," Yeah, with no, it's really graphics."
1844.84,1848.84, I remember being at some EA stars dryhumping for me.
1848.84,1849.84, Right.
1849.84,1850.84, That's what he was doing.
1850.84,1852.84, Was he one of those tenacle head ladies?
1852.84,1856.84," Um, why, like, yeah, I think he was a, I think he was a tenacle head."
1856.84,1858.84, He was in the hot one.
1858.84,1860.84," And they, I mean, he had a whole story."
1860.84,1862.84, I really should let him tell the story because it's fantastic.
1862.84,1866.84," He had a whole story of who the, who he was as a human playing this character."
1866.84,1868.84, All these guys thought that he was like this.
1868.84,1871.84, This waitress who worked at Olive Garden in the Midwest.
1871.84,1874.84," I mean, they thought he was really a check who was playing."
1874.84,1876.84," Well, I was a mom like, and was lap dancing."
1876.84,1879.84," And because he made a fortune, that's why."
1879.84,1881.84," Well, why would do who wants Star Wars money that bad?"
1881.84,1883.84, He did as a joke.
1883.84,1885.84, He was as he had this whole funny joke.
1885.84,1887.84, He had this whole career gone.
1887.84,1889.84, It was a non-mind past the day.
1889.84,1891.84," And it was, yeah, it was amazing."
1891.84,1895.84," He had like regular John's like a, who would, like, send him gifts after a while."
1895.84,1897.84, He would just log on and you have shit waiting in his way.
1897.84,1900.84," But did they ever, they inevitably start asking for us like,"
1900.84,1903.84," who personal account like, well, they would like try to, but he would be like,"
1903.84,1904.84," Sorry, honey."
1904.84,1905.84, Ha ha.
1905.84,1906.84, This is just work buried.
1906.84,1907.84," Yeah, four kids."
1907.84,1908.84, Like those were just like treasures.
1908.84,1911.84," But he, I would come over every once in a while and he was texting and you would just be,"
1911.84,1914.84," I mean, you would know when someone was in Robert watching him because he would just hear,"
1914.84,1918.84," Oh, you just hear various one of the better."
1918.84,1919.84," Like, oh, man."
1919.84,1922.84," Because I mean, he was just like full on like they kind of going forward."
1922.84,1925.84, He would take them into back rooms and he would service them.
1925.84,1926.84, Yeah.
1926.84,1928.84," He should, that game should be shut down."
1929.84,1930.84," Yeah, for that reason alone."
1930.84,1933.84," I remember being, I was at an E and he got into it."
1933.84,1938.84, That was the great thing was he was doing it as a joke the way you guys didn't do the
1938.84,1939.84, Ganking just for laughs.
1939.84,1941.84, And then he like got into his career.
1941.84,1944.84, And I was at this E and I'll have him on the podcast so he can admit to this.
1944.84,1948.84," We were at like one of those EA summer days things, whatever, at their campus."
1948.84,1952.84, Or outside at these like tables with all these journalists and he like walks over with this
1952.84,1956.84," plate of food and like out loud goes like, I've got to get back because there's client"
1957.84,1960.84, is waiting for me to dance for him at like four o'clock and we got to get out of here.
1960.84,1964.84," And he's saying that's like stressed serious like allowed and we're like,"
1964.84,1965.84, Dude indoor voice.
1965.84,1966.84," I mean, it was embarrassing."
1966.84,1969.84, You're just like just trying to tell me this was a joke.
1969.84,1971.84," Well, it was a joke that he first at first."
1971.84,1973.84, But then he kind of got into it.
1973.84,1974.84, This is dangerous stuff.
1974.84,1976.84, He wrote a great hilarious calm about it.
1976.84,1979.84," But then after the calm was done, he was still playing."
1979.84,1982.84," You were like, time for the intervention."
1982.84,1983.84, Man.
1983.84,1989.84," Anyway, no, how I got off in that because of this guy complaining about the dancing in"
1989.84,1990.84, Conan.
1990.84,1992.84, This is why we want dancing in Conan.
1992.84,1994.84, He was one of Robert's clients.
1994.84,1996.84, Could this have been Robert posting?
1996.84,1997.84, Made it.
1997.84,1998.84, It's her son and like.
1998.84,2001.84, He can't get any money.
2001.84,2009.84, This he wanted to transfer his career to age of Conan.
2009.84,2011.84," Before I forget, I want to spread Anthony's name."
2011.84,2012.84, Yeah.
2012.84,2015.84," No, I told you that that was not okay."
2015.84,2017.84, All right.
2017.84,2020.84, Now you got to.
2020.84,2021.84, You've been through it.
2021.84,2024.84, Anthony in game started off.
2024.84,2029.84," Well, just because he used to go by chuff, but I want everyone to call him"
2029.84,2030.84, Nergol.
2030.84,2032.84, And there he is for the circle.
2032.84,2034.84," Nergol is the, what is he?"
2034.84,2037.84, The deity of pestilence in the Warhammer universe.
2037.84,2038.84, True.
2038.84,2039.84, Anthony started.
2039.84,2043.84, But now and then he would fart in the microphone and then trill a weird plan.
2043.84,2045.84, I think I'm going to talk about this before.
2045.84,2048.84, But now he's got to the point where he'll do it like 30.
2048.84,2050.84, That was one night in a night.
2050.84,2052.84, That was one more.
2052.84,2054.84," And dude, no, no."
2054.84,2055.84, Wasn't one night.
2055.84,2057.84," Fuck it lying, man."
2057.84,2058.84, Every night.
2058.84,2060.84, And burping on top of it.
2060.84,2061.84, And like then you'll log off.
2061.84,2063.84, It'll be like chuff has left the server.
2063.84,2066.84, And then all of a sudden you hear chuff is joined the server.
2066.84,2067.84, Chuff is left the server.
2067.84,2071.84," Like even if he's not in the other room doing something else, he'll always come over."
2071.84,2074.84, Log in and shit on us and log out.
2074.84,2075.84, And combine all that.
2075.84,2077.84," So just like, yeah, Nergol man."
2077.84,2079.84, Like I get it.
2079.84,2080.84, Perfect.
2080.84,2081.84, It's a perfect fit.
2081.84,2084.84, I always plus the call you that in just in game or all the time.
2084.84,2085.84, It's just all the time.
2085.84,2086.84, I have all the time.
2086.84,2088.84, It's not a podcast.
2088.84,2089.84, I will never.
2089.84,2090.84, I will never.
2090.84,2093.84, You spell Nergols are how many apostrophes are in there.
2093.84,2094.84," No, no, actually."
2095.84,2096.84, It's a prize.
2096.84,2097.84, But is there an age there?
2097.84,2098.84, No.
2098.84,2099.84, No.
2099.84,2100.84, Okay.
2100.84,2102.84, Lame systematically.
2102.84,2103.84, Nergolites.
2103.84,2104.84, Nergolites.
2104.84,2105.84, Okay.
2105.84,2106.84, How lazy.
2106.84,2110.84," So in general though, a bigger thumbs up for coming in then."
2110.84,2111.84, Is that what I'm hearing?
2111.84,2112.84, Yeah.
2112.84,2113.84, I have to say this one's going on.
2113.84,2115.84, I'm talking MMO for any period of time.
2115.84,2116.84, I was just having some.
2116.84,2117.84, Yeah.
2117.84,2120.84," I'm still like nodding it to the extent that the rest of these guys are like,"
2120.84,2122.84, I always try to get people to play company heroes.
2122.84,2124.84, I'm probably on that boat with you.
2124.84,2125.84, Yeah.
2125.84,2127.84," I like to play with everyone, but I'd rather play co."
2127.84,2130.84," But the other guys though, we'll go in and as soon as like,"
2130.84,2132.84," if even one of us gets killed or something,"
2132.84,2133.84, do I get my main?
2133.84,2134.84, I'm getting my main.
2134.84,2136.84, Then they like go with the log out.
2136.84,2137.84, Come back in.
2137.84,2138.84, It's like a more powerful character.
2138.84,2139.84, Do you have alt?
2139.84,2140.84, Yeah.
2140.84,2141.84, Yeah.
2141.84,2142.84, Yeah.
2142.84,2144.84, Yeah.
2144.84,2145.84, Yeah.
2145.84,2146.84, And yeah.
2146.84,2148.84, And then they did the pre launch thing too.
2148.84,2149.84, Yeah.
2149.84,2151.84," Oh, they have the bottom stays."
2151.84,2152.84, Yeah.
2152.84,2153.84, I don't think they don't think they have jobs.
2153.84,2155.84," They played in the, oh, you know, here's the beginning."
2155.84,2156.84, They had the beta.
2156.84,2157.84, You couldn't keep your beta character.
2157.84,2158.84, Right.
2158.84,2159.84, No.
2159.84,2160.84, So then that's three.
2160.84,2162.84," You know, the two that they have now plus their beta characters that,"
2162.84,2164.84," you know, you couldn't take them to high level."
2164.84,2165.84, Right.
2165.84,2168.84," But like I said, I think you and I are the only ones in there that have jobs."
2168.84,2169.84, Right.
2169.84,2170.84, Yeah.
2170.84,2171.84, It's disappointing.
2171.84,2172.84, Like even over the long weekend.
2172.84,2173.84, I don't excuse.
2173.84,2174.84," I'd be like, I don't see like Roya and the MSN."
2174.84,2176.84, I was going to like pay some some news link or something from BBC.
2176.84,2178.84, And then I go in to ventrilo and like there.
2178.84,2179.84, They are.
2179.84,2180.84, Yeah.
2180.84,2181.84," And I'm like, did you guys still play in?"
2181.84,2182.84," Like, yeah."
2182.84,2183.84, We never went to sleep.
2183.84,2185.84, I've been there.
2185.84,2186.84, Calls.
2186.84,2187.84, But MMOs do.
2187.84,2188.84, Yeah.
2188.84,2189.84, I don't like that.
2189.84,2190.84, That was called.
2190.84,2191.84, Yeah.
2191.84,2193.84, That's what I wanted to do this weekend.
2193.84,2194.84, Yeah.
2194.84,2195.84, Yeah.
2195.84,2199.84, I haven't been able to do that since I've requested probably.
2199.84,2200.84, Yeah.
2200.84,2201.84," Me, my family had a 10."
2201.84,2202.84, Then I can do it.
2202.84,2203.84, Yeah.
2203.84,2205.84, Are you guys looking to write over there?
2205.84,2207.84, I'm going to feel guilty.
2207.84,2208.84, No.
2208.84,2211.84, I'm going to feel guilty from playing many games but MMOs for some reason when I'm done.
2211.84,2212.84, I feel like two.
2212.84,2213.84, That was like a horrible waste of my time.
2213.84,2214.84, I've been doing something else.
2214.84,2216.84, Like a different game.
2216.84,2217.84, Even another game would have been better.
2217.84,2218.84," But I mean, yeah."
2218.84,2219.84, Like anything.
2219.84,2224.84, And if I'm having fun reading or if you enjoyed yourself then it's all good.
2224.84,2225.84, Yeah.
2225.84,2226.84, It's fine.
2226.84,2227.84, It's just some weird day.
2227.84,2228.84, I don't know why.
2228.84,2231.84, Maybe it's because I spent so many years making fun of people that played MMOs.
2231.84,2232.84, Maybe.
2232.84,2234.84, And there's no end.
2234.84,2235.84, Right.
2235.84,2236.84," I mean, you're like you're beating it."
2236.84,2237.84, Yeah.
2237.84,2238.84, And I'm not going to have many multiplayer games.
2238.84,2239.84, You can't really.
2239.84,2240.84, Right.
2240.84,2241.84, True.
2241.84,2243.84," And you know, company of heroes."
2243.84,2244.84, I think it was.
2244.84,2247.84, I had a big set up because all the years I worked in grocery.
2247.84,2251.1200000000003, Like there was this woman who worked in the produce department with us and her and her husband
2251.1200000000003,2252.84, were waiting to ask her on to call.
2252.84,2253.84, One.
2253.84,2258.44, And they would listen to her talk about that shit and how like they had separate computers
2258.44,2261.84, and then how they got divorced and then she started seeing someone she'd met in the
2261.84,2264.84, game and then he started like every time I'd hear them talk about it.
2264.84,2265.84, And I had never even.
2265.84,2269.84, I had never even seen an MMO when I just listened to this shit.
2269.84,2274.84," And then yeah, I was like wow, this is the most pathetic thing."
2274.84,2278.84," I mean, they might as well be like the same as like someone just tell me about how much money"
2278.84,2281.84, they wasted gambling at the reservation the night before how they went.
2281.84,2285.84, About like $600 and pull tabs scratch off or something.
2285.84,2287.84," And then so I was yeah, it's stupid."
2287.84,2289.84," You know, it's stupidized it."
2289.84,2293.84," So whenever I remember the first time I played Guild Wars, I was like, dude, am I really doing this?"

2299.84,2300.84, Yeah.
2300.84,2305.84," Well, it's like, yeah, it's kind of like how probably like if Ryan had had a beer, he probably"
2305.84,2306.84, felt guilty afterwards.
2306.84,2307.84, Right.
2307.84,2310.84, You can't have an beers absolutely getting nothing because he spent his whole life not doing it.
2310.84,2315.84," He feels guilty when we're sitting in here talking about illegal substances, not doing them."
2315.84,2317.84, He doesn't even want to be here when we're talking about it.
2317.84,2318.84, Makes him feel bad.
2318.84,2320.84, Did he talk to you after the last time?
2320.84,2321.84," No, no, okay."
2321.84,2323.84, You can just tell he feels nervous.

2605.84,2610.84, And we were the perfect example of that didn't even think of bringing the maps.
2610.84,2615.84," Because we knew that we had a Google maps on my well, fricking tree."
2615.84,2616.84, I'll think.
2616.84,2618.84, So we knew we didn't have to.
2618.84,2623.84," And we had printed out a, you know, map quest thing before we left."
2623.84,2626.84, I used Google maps five my way to my weekend destination as well.

2648.84,2649.84, What were you trying to do?
2649.84,2650.84, Did you say?
2650.84,2651.84, Try it again.
2651.84,2652.84, See if I bite the snow.
2652.84,2655.84," I was trying to talk about the, the convention."
2655.84,2656.84, I went to this weekend.
2656.84,2657.84, It's a very slow.
2657.84,2659.84, What can the two Anthony?
2659.84,2660.84, The first convention.
2660.84,2662.84, Just like the magic together.
2662.84,2666.84," Now, well, it is on it on it's actually a leap."
2666.84,2667.84, Some bounds above that.
2667.84,2670.84," And I mean, like in the wrong direction."
2670.84,2672.84," It's a, it's called cool."
2672.84,2673.84, The con.
2673.84,2675.84," Now, why is it named after?"
2675.84,2679.84," Well, he wasn't, I was going to say, I mean, he was lesser than than than"
2679.84,2680.84, Ganges con.
2680.84,2682.84, Because it's a war games convention.
2682.84,2684.84," And I know, but if you're going to pick a con though,"
2684.84,2685.84, I have no way.
2685.84,2686.84, I like to go straight to Ganges.
2686.84,2687.84, So I know.
2687.84,2688.84, I'll stick Ganges con.
2688.84,2689.84," Maybe, yeah."
2689.84,2690.84, Or a B car tracks con.
2690.84,2692.84, There's two major.
2692.84,2695.84, There's two cars.
2695.84,2699.84, There's two major table top gaming conventions in one is in Tennessee.
2699.84,2704.84," And the biggest one, this side of Tennessee is in California, Northern California."
2704.84,2705.84," Yeah, it's the Kubrick cool."
2705.84,2706.84, Awesome.
2706.84,2710.84," In the high, high at Regency in in Berlin, game California."
2710.84,2713.84," It does sound similar to the whole of the co-factory, right?"
2713.84,2715.84, So I guess so.
2715.84,2716.84, Burlington.
2716.84,2717.84," Oh, okay."
2717.84,2718.84, You got a lot of these.
2718.84,2720.84, You were the magic convention.
2720.84,2722.84," Well, I have a lot of really nerdy friends."
2722.84,2723.84, And through your names.
2723.84,2724.84, Merrill.
2724.84,2725.84, Good blaming your friends.
2725.84,2727.84, I do play to the table top games that I'm saying.
2727.84,2728.84, It's okay.
2728.84,2732.84, The reason I went to this one was because my friend Dennis Bray wrote his own rules
2732.84,2734.84, set for a miniatures game.
2734.84,2737.84, And he just had him printed by a professional printing place.
2737.84,2741.84, And so he was presenting at the convention and demoing his game to try and sell
2741.84,2742.84, it.
2742.84,2743.84, Yeah.
2743.84,2744.84, And so I don't know.
2744.84,2745.84, He did that on Sunday.
2745.84,2746.84, I just went Saturday and hung out with him.
2746.84,2747.84," But you know, it was interesting."
2747.84,2750.84," I mean, you would think like it only takes place in this high Regency."
2750.84,2751.84, So how big could it be?
2751.84,2753.84, But it's actually insanely big.
2753.84,2754.84, Like that hotels gigantic.
2754.84,2755.84, It's like a pentagon.
2755.84,2758.84, And then in the centers like this gigantic atrium.
2758.84,2763.84," But they just had a bit of Gillian tables with like everything from like warhammer 40K,"
2763.84,2765.84, which would be like the simplest work game that was there.
2765.84,2770.84, To like historical battles between like British people and African tribesmen and stuff like that.
2770.84,2771.84, Zulu war.
2771.84,2772.84, Yeah.
2772.84,2775.84," Where were they like in costume or this is like, no, this is just table top."
2775.84,2776.84," Yeah, managers."
2776.84,2777.84, Yeah.
2777.84,2778.84, But you know.
2778.84,2782.84, So when you want to have the Zulu Wars with a pen and paper.
2782.84,2783.84, Yeah.
2783.84,2787.84," That's kind of what it was like, except you know, but then like along with like the cool things"
2787.84,2790.84," where you'd see the historical battle like that, you'd see like the guys that we're doing,"
2790.84,2795.84, like the table top airplane game wearing like replica RAF hats while they were doing it.
2795.84,2796.84, Yeah.
2796.84,2798.84, Or like people wearing his helmet on the other guys.
2798.84,2799.84, Yeah.
2799.84,2803.84, But the worst thing I saw which was before the end of the night when I left was this thing they were
2803.84,2806.84," putting on mostly for the kids, but it was Aliens Larping."
2806.84,2809.84, And it was Aliens the alien.
2809.84,2810.84, Yeah.
2810.84,2811.84, The red red red red red red.
2811.84,2812.84, Yeah.
2812.84,2816.84, So one guy was walking around with a big paper Michelley and's hat on the wall.
2816.84,2819.84, We're like two mannequins with like a chess booster and a face hugger.
2819.84,2821.84, And then there were like bigs for kids.
2821.84,2822.84, Yeah.
2822.84,2824.84," Most of the kids, but there was adults participating too."
2824.84,2828.84, And then like the kids were all wearing shirts would just be like marine or alien.
2828.84,2833.84," And then you know, there was like a grid and they would like have the spinner to determine like if"
2833.84,2835.84, if they were shooting and stuff like that.
2835.84,2837.84, That's Larping on a different level when I've heard of Larping.
2837.84,2838.84, Yeah.
2838.84,2839.84, Exactly.
2839.84,2840.84, That's what I thought too.
2840.84,2841.84, But yeah.
2841.84,2844.84," I mean, you had like little kids hiding with like the eggs because they were face huggers."
2844.84,2845.84, So they had like these big old paper.
2845.84,2846.84," Oh, I'll let a Larpie talking like."
2846.84,2848.84, I don't know like seven year olds or something.
2848.84,2851.84, But then you had full grown adults in camouflage like scary.
2851.84,2853.84, Like scary shit out of the little kids.
2853.84,2854.84, Yeah.
2854.84,2855.84, Like the adults that had no social scene in the movie.
2855.84,2857.84, Like do they know what they're what they're probably trying.
2858.84,2859.84," Yeah, probably not."
2859.84,2861.84, I'll Paris like exactly.
2861.84,2865.84, It was it was rather probably did because then whatever free show parents that made the.
2865.84,2867.84," Oh, I'm a shape thing on the wall."
2867.84,2869.84, I'm probably probably running on the watch room.
2869.84,2870.84, These were these were special.
2870.84,2872.84," So don't go to bed yet, Susie."
2872.84,2873.84, Watch daily.
2873.84,2874.84, It's too direct.
2874.84,2875.84," Oh, I'm scared to tell."
2875.84,2876.84, Daddy.
2876.84,2877.84, Please.
2877.84,2878.84, It didn't matter.
2878.84,2881.84, I felt sorry because like this hotel's like right next to SFO.
2881.84,2885.84," So like anyone any random executive is like, I'll go stay in the high regions."
2885.84,2886.84, That week.
2886.84,2887.84, Yeah.
2887.84,2888.84, It's like the worst thing you get over here because it was like 10 o'clock at night.
2888.84,2891.84," And you hear like the people that were like, it's time to alarm."
2891.84,2893.84, You didn't listen to it.
2893.84,2894.84, Yeah.
2894.84,2895.84, Yeah.
2895.84,2898.84," You know, they'd be getting all the people pumped up for this alien thing they were doing."
2898.84,2899.84, That's going to be my new kind of place.
2899.84,2900.84, It's time to alarm.
2900.84,2903.84," We're like, was it really like, oh."
2903.84,2905.84," Yeah, literally like a big nerd cheer."
2905.84,2908.84," You know, people with very people with replicatorids or kilts."
2908.84,2914.84," You know, and what I was equating it to to my friend was like back in early modern year up and before and stuff."
2914.84,2920.84," You know, they had like a, you know, the big thing fat Tuesday before lit and stuff where they just let the peasants go nuts."
2920.84,2928.84," That way they could like get it out of their system and they wouldn't, you know, most people think it was like a social release where they wouldn't end up trying to kill like the royalty for the rest of the year."
2928.84,2929.84, I think that that's what this is.
2929.84,2937.84," This is like you let the nerds come where the replicatorids, you don't ask why they're wearing the replicatorids and then they don't bring those replicatorids to the office and kill you during the rest of the year."
2937.84,2938.84, They don't go on the scale ramp.
2938.84,2940.84, They're really exactly.
2940.84,2941.84, Yeah.
2941.84,2944.84, You just let them get it all out of their system and one weekend.
2944.84,2945.84, What did you say? I missed it.
2945.84,2946.84," No, don't repeat."
2946.84,2947.84, Let's move on.
2947.84,2948.84, Yeah.
2948.84,2951.84, I hope that people just rewind it.
2951.84,2952.84, We.
2952.84,2953.84, Yeah.
2953.84,2954.84, They have.
2954.84,2955.84, They have interesting.
2955.84,2957.84, So like how many people were talking about hundreds?
2957.84,2959.84," Oh, those are like six people."
2959.84,2962.84," I'm going to guess it was more like like 4,000 or something."
2962.84,2963.84, What?
2963.84,2964.84," Yeah, it was huge."
2964.84,2965.84, It was huge.
2965.84,2966.84, It was like a largest.
2966.84,2969.84," Even though it was this only this one hotel, this hotel is huge first of all."
2969.84,2971.84, Like hundreds and hundreds of rooms.
2971.84,2975.84, They were all taken and then on top of the two big halls being taken.
2975.84,2977.84, Their every restaurant was taken over by nerds.
2977.84,2982.84, Every like conference room they had was taken over like anywhere that there was space to put up folding tables.
2982.84,2984.84, There was tables with people playing.
2984.84,2985.84, It was insane.
2985.84,2987.84, So you have to have some nice photos from this right.
2987.84,2988.84, Yeah.
2988.84,2989.84, I do.
2989.84,2990.84, You should.
2990.84,2991.84, I don't know.
2991.84,2992.84, I don't know.
2992.84,2993.84, Yeah.
2993.84,2995.84," I mean, you know, yeah, you know, and they have free games."
2995.84,2997.84, You can play at any time and people really.
2997.84,2999.84, And I even saw people playing age of empires.
2999.84,3000.84, The board game.
3000.84,3002.84, I didn't know there was it wasn't just tabletop.
3002.84,3003.84, Minature games.
3003.84,3004.84, It was also.
3004.84,3005.84, It was also a game.
3005.84,3006.84," Well, definitely."
3006.84,3007.84," Yeah, just straight up board games."
3007.84,3008.84, And then also people just played.
3008.84,3009.84, It did.
3009.84,3010.84, You did.
3010.84,3011.84, You did.
3011.84,3012.84, Cruise around like Jane good all the minute.
3012.84,3013.84, What did you do?
3013.84,3014.84," No, that's exactly."
3014.84,3015.84, I did.
3015.84,3016.84, I didn't.
3016.84,3019.84, I did just cruise around the whole time because as I just didn't know anyone.
3019.84,3020.84, And I didn't know what games to play.
3020.84,3021.84, And I was a little.
3021.84,3024.84, I was actually like reverse it reverse intimidated by these people.
3024.84,3026.84," Yeah, like maybe they feel intimidated the rest of the time."
3026.84,3029.84," Yeah, if you try to sit down and play like access now, I was with someone there."
3029.84,3032.84," You exactly like that was straight like yeah, I didn't know how to play most of these games."
3032.84,3034.84, And I didn't want to be like that guy that walks up.
3034.84,3036.84, Do you want to play in period of Galactica?
3036.84,3037.84, Yeah.
3037.84,3038.84, Yeah.
3038.84,3041.84, So I I just spend a lot of time watching people play games.
3041.84,3042.84, Who?
3042.84,3046.84, But I just start talking to these people next time to get right to story about it.
3046.84,3049.84," You know, like see what's going on."
3049.84,3051.84, We are we're going to have a.
3051.84,3052.84, We're gaming.
3052.84,3054.84, Block column coming up.
3055.84,3056.84, Now the volume.
3056.84,3057.84," But blah, blah."
3057.84,3058.84, Thanks.
3058.84,3059.84, Work clock.
3059.84,3060.84, Yeah.
3060.84,3063.84, And he's going to venture into the world of.
3063.84,3064.84," Well, he already does."
3064.84,3069.84, He covers a lot of board games and table type games.
3069.84,3072.84, And we're going to like him talk about that at one up.
3072.84,3073.84, So hell yeah.
3073.84,3074.84, Yeah.
3074.84,3075.84, I think I think there's room for that.
3075.84,3079.84, Like the fable line of attack within the pages of GFW and CGW.
3079.84,3080.84, Indeed.
3080.84,3083.84," I mean, I think a lot of people like board games."
3083.84,3087.84, It's just maybe the whole setting up and taking it down and finding people play with the
3087.84,3088.84, TARD.
3088.84,3089.84, There you go.
3089.84,3090.84, Which is why on Xbox Live.
3090.84,3091.84, Yeah.
3091.84,3092.84, I love games like Carcasson or Caton.
3092.84,3093.84, Exactly.
3093.84,3095.84, And there's like so many other ones that I play like this game called zombies.
3095.84,3097.84," Like I'm like, man, if I'm the zombie."
3097.84,3098.84, Exactly.
3098.84,3099.84, I love zombies with you.
3099.84,3100.84," But yeah, I have to hear it."
3100.84,3101.84, The office is a matter of fact.
3101.84,3102.84, Yeah.
3102.84,3103.84, Yeah.
3103.84,3104.84, To ride another one.
3104.84,3105.84, Yeah.
3105.84,3106.84, Exactly.
3106.84,3107.84, Like I always want these games to come out on live just because it's like so much easier to find a game.
3107.84,3108.84, There's no like.
3108.84,3109.84, Yeah.
3109.84,3112.84," I mean, I think that's what I've never tried to mind live."
3112.84,3114.84, Carcasson and Caton are great.
3114.84,3115.84, Yeah.
3115.84,3116.84, Yeah.
3116.84,3121.84," I mean, part of the reason I sit down to play a board game is because, you know, I'm with free people that I enjoy playing board games."
3121.84,3122.84, Right.
3122.84,3124.84, Just then I don't get to play him as often as I'd want to.
3124.84,3125.84, Right.
3125.84,3128.84," I mean, you can play against AI and it's fun and stuff."
3128.84,3135.84," But if you play, you know, I was playing Caton for a little while and, you know, playing with three other people with head sets."
3135.84,3138.84, It was really kind of like actually doing it.
3138.84,3142.84," And right, and you didn't have to like go through the hassle of getting four people to your house."
3142.84,3144.84," I mean, which really wants your an adult."
3144.84,3145.84, Yeah.
3145.84,3146.84, It's much harder to do than that.
3146.84,3147.84, Yeah.
3147.84,3149.84, I think it's a really cool.
3149.84,3150.84," No, we did the ball."
3150.84,3152.84, We had to do it just specifically like it's board game night.
3152.84,3154.84, That's another good way of doing it.
3154.84,3155.84, Yeah.
3155.84,3157.84, If you're going to do it and having like four that you already have all planned out to play.
3157.84,3158.84, Yeah.
3158.84,3160.84, But what didn't you do that for a while here at the.
3160.84,3161.84, I think he still does.
3161.84,3162.84, At the gym.
3162.84,3163.84, I don't know.
3163.84,3164.84, I don't know.
3164.84,3165.84, Yeah.
3165.84,3168.84, Saturday afternoon is something they'd regular have regularly have people over.
3168.84,3171.84, I play this problem is everyone I did that with is now moved to another city.
3171.84,3172.84, So sad.
3172.84,3174.84, No one to do it with anyone.
3174.84,3178.84, Yeah. I'll like see like a story on some new board game that sounds awesome.
3178.84,3180.84, And I think I'm going to get this one.
3180.84,3181.84, This one I'm going to get.
3181.84,3182.84, I'll get my kid into it.
3182.84,3184.84, And then there's just no way.
3184.84,3186.84, He lives in the darkly man games of birds.
3186.84,3187.84, I know.
3187.84,3188.84, Like a breaching awesome.
3188.84,3189.84, It's an awesome store.
3189.84,3190.84, Yep.
3190.84,3191.84, That's a mecca.
3191.84,3192.84, Yeah.
3192.84,3193.84, This game is take a long time to play.
3193.84,3194.84, Yeah.
3194.84,3195.84, That's the thing though.
3195.84,3198.84, A lot of those games nowadays do say on the back like expected play time.
3198.84,3200.84, We would have to stay warned for some of our games.
3200.84,3203.84, We would have like a dedicated table where we would like leave it.
3203.84,3204.84, It's up.
3204.84,3206.84, It's like if they're trying to you.
3206.84,3207.84, They're like prohibitively long.
3207.84,3211.84, You're like it's okay now the box says but like you don't just wander in the games of Berkeley.
3211.84,3212.84," And you're like, you know,"
3212.84,3214.84, we're sticking about getting boggle.
3214.84,3215.84, But this.
3215.84,3218.84, But it carcassone sounds pretty promising.
3218.84,3219.84," Well, that's a thing."
3219.84,3220.84," Oh, no."
3220.84,3221.84, It's about six hours long.
3221.84,3222.84, I think like.
3222.84,3224.84, It's a different like subculture.
3224.84,3225.84, The thing is.
3225.84,3226.84, Yeah.
3226.84,3227.84, I think you're right.
3227.84,3228.84, Okay.
3228.84,3230.84, So I kind of take your advice with comics and apply it to games.
3230.84,3233.84, Like I won't buy a board game unless someone in the no tells me that it's good.
3233.84,3234.84, Just like I won't buy a comic book.
3234.84,3235.84, Sure.
3235.84,3238.84, And unless someone like you tells me like this comics is good.
3238.84,3240.84, Because I made the mistake one time with comics.
3240.84,3241.84, Yeah.
3241.84,3242.84, Imagine they would be the same.
3242.84,3245.84, If you walked into games of Berkeley and you had no idea because there's just so many.
3245.84,3246.84, They're arranged like.
3246.84,3247.84, It's crazy.
3247.84,3248.84, Yeah.
3248.84,3250.84," And it's like, here's an exotic name."
3250.84,3253.84, You look at something that subject matter you might like.
3253.84,3256.84," I'll go to by by company reputation too, right?"
3256.84,3257.84, That's true.
3257.84,3260.84," And actually days of wonder, the guys make tick to ride."
3260.84,3263.84," You know, if we knew game of theirs, I'm going to go."
3263.84,3264.84," Well, yeah."
3264.84,3267.84," I mean, I'll I'd consider it higher than other games."
3267.84,3270.84," But individual people sort of have fame, right?"
3270.84,3271.84, Sure.
3271.84,3272.84, Yeah.
3272.84,3273.84, Right.
3273.84,3274.84," Just like, you know, whatever."
3274.84,3275.84, Yeah.
3275.84,3276.84, Usually if you see.
3276.84,3278.84, I can't even hear.
3278.84,3282.84," Speaking of Berkeley and speaking of comics, I just want to a sad note."
3282.84,3284.84, I don't know if you guys know.
3284.84,3286.84, You know what I'm going to say.
3286.84,3287.84, I think that the owner died.
3287.84,3288.84, Yeah.
3288.84,3289.84, Rory route.
3289.84,3290.84, Yeah.
3290.84,3292.84, Oner of comic relief passed away this week.
3292.84,3293.84, And so that's crazy.
3293.84,3295.84, You know that because we like did you go?
3295.84,3297.84, Did you where you out?
3297.84,3301.84, Town shopping or I was I was a Rory route and comic relief.
3301.84,3302.84, And before you were born.
3302.84,3303.84, I'm sure you were.
3303.84,3304.84, Yeah.
3304.84,3306.84," No, I knew because I."
3307.84,3314.84, I know somehow I was on a message for a word that worked out link to because there's a website now set up as a memorial to a Rory.
3314.84,3318.84," And if you don't know, I mean, he was one of the."
3318.84,3321.84, Titans of the comic book retail business probably in the world.
3321.84,3329.84, I don't think that's an exaggeration to say certainly comic relief is probably considered one of the best comic book stores right in North America at least.
3329.84,3331.84, And he was an amazing guy.
3331.84,3334.84," I mean, I don't know if you guys ever got a chance to talk to him."
3334.84,3336.84, I don't see me there now and then personally.
3336.84,3341.84," Yeah, he was at the store last and in the later days, but he was just one of those guys."
3341.84,3347.84," He would like, you know, he was the anti comic book nerd from Simpsons because he because he knew he could have been."
3347.84,3351.84," He knew every single thing that the that character knew, right?"
3351.84,3353.84, Except he wasn't a dick at all.
3353.84,3354.84, Yeah.
3354.84,3356.84," You know, you could go in there and just be like."
3356.84,3359.84, So I've heard of this comic book about this art.
3359.84,3362.84," Name Serbs, Serbs, what's that?"
3362.84,3364.84," You know, and he would know you wouldn't know."
3364.84,3368.84, And he would like very patiently and and with enthusiasm.
3368.84,3369.84, Right.
3369.84,3371.84," Like, turn you on to it."
3371.84,3377.84," Like, oh, you mean Cerberus and it's by Dave Sim and he's kind of a psycho Jack Jackal asshole now."
3377.84,3380.84, But when he started he was amazing and you should probably get this first book.
3380.84,3383.84, He was so great about like sharing and should work there.
3383.84,3384.84, Share.
3384.84,3385.84, Yeah.
3385.84,3386.84, Now when this by shuts down.
3387.84,3388.84," No, I didn't say that."
3388.84,3394.84," We're I mean shuts down in 2000 and 2200 and anyway, let's move on."
3394.84,3399.84, He was just I'm trying to say as he was a great guy.
3399.84,3403.84, It's a huge loss both to the Berkeley community and the comic book world.
3403.84,3404.84, I don't see what he was amazing.
3404.84,3407.84," I don't remember exactly how old city was, but it didn't look like he was that old."
3407.84,3408.84, He was 50.
3408.84,3409.84, I was going to say yeah.
3409.84,3410.84," Oh, yeah."
3410.84,3412.84, I'm not sure exactly why he died.
3412.84,3414.84, I think it says on his website.
3415.84,3418.84," Anyway, just wanted to throw that out there."
3418.84,3420.84, Just stay.
3420.84,3423.84," I was disappointed when I was in there not because of the store, but just the,"
3423.84,3426.84, I don't think there are enough good comics coming out right now.
3426.84,3429.84," Well, you guys definitely turned me on the walking dead."
3429.84,3430.84, Right.
3430.84,3431.84, We have another issue that came out.
3431.84,3432.84, I'm behind now.
3432.84,3434.84, I told Anthony you just got to get me to do it.
3434.84,3436.84, Until I catch up.
3436.84,3437.84, I'm way behind.
3437.84,3441.84," Yeah, I'm always like the really good stuff is just so few and far between."
3441.84,3443.84, I'm always waiting for something else by Josacco and then he'll just go.
3443.84,3447.84, I'm always waiting for something else by Josacco and then he'll just either find a way to do either something for like a.
3447.84,3448.84, New York magazine.
3448.84,3450.84, It's only about a five page as long or a way to re-pack.
3450.84,3451.84, Something's already done.
3451.84,3452.84, For a moment.
3452.84,3454.84, I thought there was a new Chris where.
3454.84,3459.84," Actuality library was labeled 18 and a half, but it was just a series of prints from."
3459.84,3461.84, That he'd done for New York or covers.
3461.84,3465.84," Although I someone sent me a link, you know, I guess there's a, is it show time."
3465.84,3467.84, There's this American life for TV.
3467.84,3468.84, Yep.
3468.84,3470.84, He's been animating some entries in that.
3471.84,3474.84, And the one I saw on YouTube was really interesting.
3474.84,3476.84," Oh, that was cool."
3476.84,3477.84, So it all.
3477.84,3480.84," Yeah, Sean, I know you've been playing Penny Arcade."
3480.84,3481.84, I have.
3481.84,3486.84," Alright, so I don't have to play that on the rain slick precipice of darkness episode one."
3486.84,3488.84, And it's cool.
3488.84,3489.84, I like it.
3489.84,3490.84, It's a.
3490.84,3497.84," The thing that struck me about it, which is I think the most surprising thing about it is how good a game it is because I just assumed it would just be like."
3497.84,3499.84, Penny Arcade.
3499.84,3500.84, Totally.
3500.84,3501.84," I mean, he joke thing."
3501.84,3503.84," And actually, you know, that part is fine."
3503.84,3506.84," If you like Penny Arcade, the humor translate pretty well."
3506.84,3508.84, It's pretty like.
3508.84,3513.84," Minimalistic, I guess, is the nice way to put how they for presented because basically the jokes."
3513.84,3514.84, They don't do any voice over.
3514.84,3519.84," It's just, you know, text dialogue exchange between cartoon heads."
3519.84,3523.84, And that's fine because that's a funny like Sam and Max funny.
3523.84,3525.84, Do you like Penny Arcade?
3525.84,3526.84, Usually.
3526.84,3529.84," Yeah, it's hit or miss for me sometimes about hilarious."
3529.84,3534.84," I think a lot of the times they put out some, they put out some excellent strips."
3534.84,3535.84, Sometimes.
3535.84,3536.84, And they're on the money.
3536.84,3541.84," Oh, rival that when it comes to video game theme comics, strip web comics."
3541.84,3543.84, I don't think that they have any.
3543.84,3544.84," Oh, they're by far the best."
3544.84,3545.84, There's a million.
3545.84,3546.84, Yeah.
3546.84,3547.84, The suck.
3547.84,3548.84, Yeah.
3548.84,3549.84," I mean, ever in a way."
3549.84,3550.84, Think just about everything.
3550.84,3552.84," Yeah, when they nail it, it's great."
3552.84,3553.84," I mean, I've always like."
3553.84,3555.84, Gaves art style.
3555.84,3556.84, I think it's really great now.
3556.84,3558.84," Like, watching them all over the years."
3558.84,3559.84, Yeah.
3559.84,3560.84, Yeah.
3560.84,3561.84, They're they're witty.
3561.84,3562.84, They're smart.
3562.84,3563.84, And that comes through here.
3563.84,3568.84, But the thing that struck me is it's obvious playing this that these people are also like.
3568.84,3573.84," Gamers who have the same, you know, when they play a game, they, they get in"
3573.84,3574.84, different.
3574.84,3576.84," And they're like, let's, in our game, we're never going to do that."
3576.84,3577.84," So the, the battle."
3577.84,3579.84, This is an RPG by the way.
3579.84,3580.84, I don't know if you were.
3580.84,3583.84," So it's, I think I was connecting a graphic adventure."
3583.84,3585.84, It is exactly what I was holding my head.
3585.84,3586.84, It is a.
3586.84,3587.84, Okay.
3587.84,3589.84, Very much a role playing game.
3589.84,3591.84," You know, you design a character."
3591.84,3593.84," But all that is really, is really cosmetic."
3593.84,3596.84," You're just, it's kind of a just a rudimentary way to get you."
3596.84,3599.84," You in the game next to the, you know, game and take a."
3599.84,3603.84," But the, the battle system is shockingly good."
3603.84,3604.84, Like it's better than.
3604.84,3608.84, Like it takes everything that I was annoyed with in the final fantasy ones because it's very much
3608.84,3610.84, style after a Japanese role playing game.
3610.84,3612.84, And by the kind of fixism.
3613.84,3614.84, Super sense of it.
3614.84,3616.84," Well, it's actually not."
3616.84,3618.84, So the way it works is each character.
3618.84,3620.84, You have three characters.
3620.84,3622.84, Much of once you get all three.
3622.84,3625.84, Each character has a little meter at the bottom.
3625.84,3627.84, And first the meter that lets you.
3627.84,3630.84, So it's real time basically even everyone's just kind of standing.
3630.84,3634.84, They're still still the first meter to fill up as the item meter.
3634.84,3636.84," So once that fills up, we're just pretty quick."
3636.84,3637.84, You're allowed to use items.
3637.84,3640.84," And then if you wait longer, your attack meter will fill up."
3640.84,3642.84, So that means you can do a regular attack.
3642.84,3644.84," And if you wait even longer, your special attack meter will fill up."
3644.84,3647.84," And if you wait for two characters, you just, you just sit there."
3647.84,3648.84," Well, they're."
3648.84,3649.84," No, it's."
3649.84,3651.84," It sounds like there's a lot of waiting, but there's actually not."
3651.84,3655.84," There's a lot of like, actually it's really frantic because there's also these other"
3655.84,3657.84, layers going on well.
3657.84,3660.84, One character is probably going to be at a point where you want to do something at any given
3660.84,3661.84, moment for one thing.
3661.84,3664.84, So like you control three and you control all three at once.
3664.84,3667.84," So if the item, if some guys are ready with an item,"
3667.84,3670.84, then you're probably going to want to use an item.
3670.84,3672.84," Unlike Final Fantasy or any of those kind of games,"
3672.84,3674.84," where usually if you pick up a thing that's like,"
3674.84,3678.84," does 300 fire damage, you just never, ever, ever, ever use them."
3678.84,3681.84, I don't know if you play Japanese role playing games anyone does here.
3681.84,3684.84," But most of the time, you just collect this shit and then vendor at some day."
3684.84,3685.84, Right.
3685.84,3688.84," They, for some, the, the, the falls from the sky for one thing."
3688.84,3691.84," So like almost anywhere you go, you're getting something."
3691.84,3693.84, And they give you a good reason to use it.
3693.84,3696.84," Like because every character and every enemy can have one deep,"
3696.84,3698.84, or above at a time.
3698.84,3700.84," And the items are pretty simple, but they're pretty powerful."
3700.84,3705.84," Like you know, might as 100% defense, who probably going to want to throw that on before you start attacking."
3705.84,3708.84," And so if like, if you, if you've seen any of me that you're like,"
3708.84,3710.84," okay, we're going to go after this guy first."
3710.84,3712.84, You want to make sure you can't really have an item on him.
3712.84,3715.84," So anyway, what exactly are you fighting in?"
3715.84,3717.84," Well, it's penny arcade."
3717.84,3719.84, So that's what I want to know.
3719.84,3720.84, Okay.
3720.84,3724.84," So the story, the story is kind of like pseudo-love crafting."
3724.84,3728.84," Like they just transported themselves to Arcadia, which is kind of like, you know,"
3728.84,3734.84," I guess in the mouth or something, where something very horrific from beyond the veil is going on."
3734.84,3739.84," And you're fighting my, garbage cans that have come to life."
3739.84,3741.84, And Hobos and Hobos.
3741.84,3742.84, And Hobos.
3742.84,3747.84," For reasons that, you know, if I even tried to explain them logically, just wouldn't work."
3747.84,3750.84," But so those are the enemies they all have, you know,"
3750.84,3756.84," they're strengths and weaknesses that are revealed as you play, which actually plays pretty cleverly into it."
3756.84,3762.84," Because if you're fighting like a barber shot quartet, part of the part of the strategy is to first figure out what"
3762.84,3763.84, they're each week against.
3763.84,3766.84," So if you're like punch one and it says, you know,"
3766.84,3771.84," resistant to punches, which is because Gabe does punches, you, you being the player,"
3771.84,3772.84, does rakes.
3772.84,3775.84, And then Tyco does Tommy guns.
3775.84,3776.84, Yeah.
3776.84,3777.84, That's basically the three types of attacks.
3777.84,3781.84, You just figure out who's weak to what who's resilient against what.
3781.84,3785.84," And then it's kind of like it does kind of sound like the same in makes you were like,"
3785.84,3788.84, I'm listening to them like I expect more from these guys.
3788.84,3790.84, Like why so I'm always saying the max human.
3790.84,3791.84, I don't know.
3791.84,3794.84," I mean, it's kind of like it's like highlights humor or something, you know, like,"
3794.84,3796.84," I have like, like, like, like, good."
3796.84,3800.84," I have a really, like, big bird just pronounce as a word or misunderstands."
3800.84,3806.84, Like they have a kid from Mexico on and he gets like a word wrong or something.
3807.84,3808.84, What?
3808.84,3810.84," Like, you know, like, I don't like a sesame straight gag."
3810.84,3814.84, I'm imagining I say he's got some other character from another country and speaks another language on
3814.84,3815.84, and big word.
3815.84,3821.84, We'll be trying to communicate with him and it'll turn out for the whole episode that like he's pronouncing a word wrong.
3821.84,3823.84," And it's he's actually saying another word, but he isn't aware of it."
3823.84,3827.84," And this tension builds up and again, they have to figure out a way to tell Big Bird"
3827.84,3830.84, without her misbeams and he's been saying it.
3830.84,3834.84," This is what I think about what I think of like Sam and Max, like this kind of humor."
3834.84,3838.84," Like, it's just, it's like, funny daddy humor, I guess, you know, like,"
3838.84,3840.84," what's, but he's got a humor."
3840.84,3841.84, Yeah.
3841.84,3842.84," It's like, do you get it?"
3842.84,3843.84, There's a mine.
3843.84,3844.84," Like, mine's are funny."
3844.84,3845.84," Like, there's a rake."
3845.84,3846.84, Do you get it?
3846.84,3848.84, You can step on a rake and hit yourself in the face like on a Maryx funny.
3848.84,3849.84," Well, that's not the funny part."
3849.84,3852.84," I mean, it's the individual dialogue that, yeah."
3852.84,3854.84," Like, I didn't see a mine and what?"
3854.84,3856.84," Well, my, my funny."
3856.84,3858.84," Yeah, that's about how you guys all act."
3858.84,3860.84," So as soon as when Sean said that there were mimes,"
3860.84,3862.84," you both, you and Anthony left."
3862.84,3863.84," Well, that's not wrong."
3863.84,3864.84, Maybe mine's our funny.
3864.84,3865.84, It's a ridiculous concept.
3865.84,3868.84," Like, it's just because the game's so ridiculous all the time."
3868.84,3869.84, Yeah.
3869.84,3870.84, Right.
3870.84,3872.84, But I see where you're coming from where it's not that.
3872.84,3873.84," It's like, oh, my I'm okay."
3873.84,3874.84," Yeah, I've seen that before."
3874.84,3875.84, Right.
3875.84,3876.84," Like, it's ridiculous."
3876.84,3877.84, Everyone that he expect.
3877.84,3878.84, Yeah.
3878.84,3879.84," Like, well, let's make mine."
3879.84,3880.84, So that's what I'm saying.
3880.84,3881.84," Well, mine's been enemies."
3881.84,3883.84," I mean, they were enemies in no one list wherever."
3883.84,3884.84, Yeah.
3884.84,3887.84, They're in James or countless comic books.
3887.84,3889.84," I mean, they're used over and over again for jokes."
3889.84,3893.84," And anytime someone's going to, like, Hulk goes to France or something."
3893.84,3894.84, Right.
3894.84,3895.84, Yeah.
3895.84,3896.84," Well, I will say it was a mime and spinal tab."
3896.84,3897.84," Without spoiling anything, the mime."
3897.84,3899.84, Did you dig into the Kthulumin part?
3899.84,3900.84, Fucking real bad.
3900.84,3901.84, You farted.
3901.84,3902.84, I did not.
3902.84,3903.84, I swear to God.
3903.84,3904.84," Oh, my God."
3904.84,3905.84, That's a late fart free podcast.
3905.84,3906.84, You did too.
3906.84,3908.84, Except you farted into the headset.
3908.84,3909.84, I didn't want to.
3909.84,3910.84, But it didn't stink.
3910.84,3911.84, I just.
3911.84,3913.84," Well, you didn't know that ahead of time."
3913.84,3914.84, It could have.
3914.84,3915.84, You did.
3915.84,3916.84, I didn't.
3916.84,3917.84," I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to make this up."
3917.84,3918.84," I know, but I would claim it if I did."
3918.84,3919.84, All right.
3919.84,3920.84, Okay.
3920.84,3922.84, You're placebo.
3922.84,3924.84, Psychosomatic fart trauma.
3924.84,3925.84, Okay.
3925.84,3929.84," So anyway, back to the NDR kid."
3929.84,3930.84, Mimes.
3930.84,3932.84," Oh, some other points on the balances."
3932.84,3934.84, Other things that are going on during this.
3934.84,3936.84, If you played Mario and Luigi on the DS.
3936.84,3937.84, Yes.
3937.84,3938.84, Okay.
3938.84,3939.84, You know how?
3939.84,3940.84," Superstar saga, you mean?"
3940.84,3941.84," Oh, no."
3941.84,3942.84, That's a different game.
3942.84,3943.84, Yeah.
3943.84,3945.84, I always like that one because they triggered it a way to make.
3945.84,3948.84, Even like the watching the battle animations slightly interactive.
3948.84,3950.84, So this does that too.
3950.84,3951.84, Yeah.
3951.84,3954.84," Where if something is attacking, you have to be kind of paying attention."
3954.84,3960.84," Both to your meters, they fill up and to the moment when they attack when you can hit a button to like block it or."
3960.84,3961.84, Right.
3961.84,3962.84, So that's that's part of it too.
3962.84,3963.84, And there's like many games.
3963.84,3964.84, There's a little mini games.
3964.84,3965.84, Yes.
3965.84,3970.84," If you do your special attacks, you have a choice by the end of three different ones per character, which allow you to."
3970.84,3972.84," You know, unleash special powers."
3972.84,3977.84," If you, one of them is like, you know, just to hit the space door real fast and then try to like line up a."
3977.84,3979.84, A little line with another little line.
3979.84,3981.84," So they're not there at that level of mini game, but it's enough."
3981.84,3982.84, Yeah.
3982.84,3990.84, There's enough going on within one battle that you're constantly engaged and you don't feel like you're just sitting there watching two things animate and then you press attack.
3990.84,3991.84, Yeah.
3991.84,3993.84, And then you watch two things animate and then you press attack.
3993.84,3994.84, It seems like you're right.
3994.84,3998.84, You are always kind of feeling like you don't have enough time to do everything you want.
3999.84,4002.84, So how long is it from start to finish?
4002.84,4008.84," I know I would say it took me, I didn't have a stopwatch, but probably about seven hours."
4008.84,4009.84, That's okay.
4009.84,4012.84," So you know, three hours for salmon max is an episode."
4012.84,4017.84," This is more, this is closer to, I guess half-life length episode."
4017.84,4019.84, But keep in mind it's an RPG.
4019.84,4020.84, Right.
4020.84,4025.84, So there's a little more repetition than episode two of half-life.
4025.84,4026.84, Right.
4026.84,4035.84, The biggest flaw is that there's like three locations and they have you just kind of go back and make the same circuit of the same location doing a different thing every time.
4035.84,4038.84," So it's like, okay, you cleaned up the hobos and hobo alley."
4038.84,4041.84, Now there's some other hobos and hobo alley that you need to get.
4041.84,4045.84," So then you kind of go back to the same areas, but it's repopulated with different enemies."
4045.84,4052.84," So that's, that's the big weakness is they, it works in salmon max when they reuse those sets because you, it is very much a sitcom."
4052.84,4055.84, You expect them to go back to the apartment because that's what they do when a sitcom or they go back to the apartment.
4055.84,4060.84," But in this it just feels like, can she have made a different hobo alley?"
4060.84,4063.84, I like it though.
4063.84,4064.84, I thought it was fun.
4064.84,4067.84," If you're a fan of the, of the strip."
4067.84,4071.84," I think if you're not the humorable just be like, what's going on here."
4071.84,4079.84," And you know, the, the game type of interaction is, it's more that than that is the video game is specific stuff."
4079.84,4084.84," And are they, if you look at the game, the game and the type of conscious of being in a game in the game,"
4084.84,4086.84, now they don't do that.
4086.84,4089.84, They don't really know.
4089.84,4092.84, They're very much characters set in a love craft universe.
4092.84,4094.84," Okay, because that'd be great."
4094.84,4098.84, They were just like reviewing the game as they went on in the game.
4098.84,4100.84," Well, that's maybe a little too meta."
4100.84,4103.84," This level's bullshit or if it were just, it is like humor."
4103.84,4104.84, It is like humor.
4104.84,4108.84," It is like you're saying if you like their humor like for, for me, what, what makes some stand out is that,"
4109.84,4118.84," you know, they'll comment on what it means to be a gamer in, you know, in the so-called hardcore environments for message boards and dealing with like advertising,"
4118.84,4123.84," dealing with, you know, how you respond to the spokespeople for each company and stuff."
4123.84,4128.84," And so if that's where like, yeah, that nature thrust to the criticism and if that's not in there,"
4128.84,4132.84," it's like, I think they're funny or doing that then making mind jokes is like, what?"
4132.84,4137.84," I mean, so is there any of that, I mean, are they parodying like games and gamers at all?"
4137.84,4139.84," Not very much, no."
4139.84,4149.84," I mean, I think the humor that they're, because I think their strips are kind of divided pretty squarely and how in terms of like these industry focused funds and then these more like,"
4149.84,4157.84," story driven ones, rather like goes to, you know, the deep crow or whatever and there's nothing to do with games whatsoever, but I still find it funny."
4157.84,4159.84, It's more on that side of the fence.
4159.84,4160.84," Right, it's done."
4160.84,4161.84, Yeah.
4161.84,4168.84," Now, someone like they had a reason when I thought that was good, where they were basically talking about how kids these days and for people, you know,"
4168.84,4176.84," I must, I take it, they must be the same age or close to ours because it's like, you just to be hard to get a look at."
4176.84,4184.84," I was about to say the P word, but it was a hard to get a look at women's genitalia when you were, you know, when you were like 14 in our era."
4184.84,4191.84," And you have to, you'd maybe get a magazine or something from like, you know, you'd find it out behind the shack where everyone hang out."
4191.84,4195.84," But now it's like, some kids, they, so there's some 15 year-all walk-up behind it."
4195.84,4202.84," Like, they kid, you know, seen more pussy than we've seen in like 30 years because, you know, just one day is worth of internet surfing."
4202.84,4213.84," And then so then it ended with how his grandma found, like, oh, yeah, when he, so yeah, what porn was precious and when you'd get it, I'm sorry for ringing your joke."
4213.84,4223.84," You'd get it, you'd want to hold on to it. So he had this ripped-up page from a skin bag and it had been all tattered and stuff from being with him so long and it is grandma found it."
4223.84,4226.84, But she just thought it was a net for RBs or something.
4226.84,4234.84," So it's like, that is right. And like, if that kind of he wears in the game, then like, I like that."
4234.84,4240.84," But yeah, I think you'd have to see it just because it's actually surprisingly good, even if it's not about video games."
4240.84,4248.84," I don't know if they're writing, you've got to honestly write and just got it. I did a preview of it a long time ago and played the first like 30 minutes."
4248.84,4252.84, It's on Xbox and PC both.
4252.84,4253.84," Yes, yes."
4253.84,4256.84," Is it the same price on PC? Do you know, because it's $20."
4256.84,4257.84, I think I'm both.
4257.84,4258.84," Yeah, okay."
4258.84,4260.84," I'm not entirely certain, no."
4260.84,4262.84, I didn't pay far enough.
4262.84,4266.84, But you should definitely check out the comic from yesterday is super fun.
4266.84,4267.84, Yeah.
4267.84,4268.84, I think I did.
4268.84,4269.84, But what was it?
4269.84,4271.84, The horse won about about the horse game.
4271.84,4275.84," It's like, please type in your 10 digit code to unlock your horse."
4275.84,4276.84," Oh, the pony."
4276.84,4279.84," And it's like, you're careless hands of types in a correct number."
4279.84,4281.84, Now your horse has been born with no bones.
4281.84,4284.84," Please, please select one to select your gun and then shoot your horse."
4284.84,4285.84," And he's like, no."
4285.84,4288.84," And it's like, please select one to shoot your horse."
4288.84,4291.84, See?
4291.84,4292.84, Yeah.
4292.84,4293.84, It's more like that.
4293.84,4296.84," I mean, that was that was game centric, but it wasn't necessarily about something that's going on."
4296.84,4297.84, And the other story.
4297.84,4299.84, Maybe you're smelling yourself by the way.
4299.84,4300.84, Yeah.
4300.84,4301.84, You're stuffed up.
4301.84,4302.84, You're sling it all out of the house.
4302.84,4303.84, Yeah.
4303.84,4304.84, He who's felt a delta guy.
4304.84,4305.84, I have to go.
4305.84,4306.84, It hasn't drifted over here.
4306.84,4307.84, I don't know if things are moving.
4307.84,4308.84, Yeah.
4308.84,4309.84, Yeah.
4309.84,4310.84, It's lingering.
4310.84,4312.84, Half of this room must be composed of fecal men.
4312.84,4313.84, I don't know.
4313.84,4315.84, Don't look at me.
4315.84,4316.84, I'm not in continent.
4316.84,4319.84, It's just because I'm just.
4319.84,4322.84," I just think I'm getting sick, man."
4322.84,4323.84, I don't know.
4323.84,4327.84, So I've been playing a lot of civilization revolutions.
4327.84,4328.84, Yeah.
4328.84,4330.84, I think I'm allowed to talk about Alex.
4330.84,4331.84," I mean, Alex just said the review."
4331.84,4333.84," So as long as you're not like this game, sir."
4333.84,4338.84, I can't review the game online now because I would be breaking the embargo.
4338.84,4339.84, So never mind.
4339.84,4341.84, I won't say whether I like it or not then.
4341.84,4342.84, I have played this game.
4342.84,4343.84, I'm looking forward to playing.
4343.84,4344.84, It has features.
4344.84,4345.84, It has features.
4345.84,4346.84, Just because I don't know.
4346.84,4350.84," It sounds totally different than the other cives, which is in the bet, which I did."
4350.84,4351.84, It's totally different.
4351.84,4354.84," And yet in some ways, remarkably the same."
4354.84,4356.84, I think so far.
4356.84,4362.84, I played one multiplayer match and I made it through one game on the easiest difficulty level on
4362.84,4365.84, on Xbox and what?
4365.84,4366.84, It's notice your shirt.
4366.84,4368.84, My Lord of the Rings shirt.
4368.84,4369.84, Yeah.
4369.84,4371.84, I just saw it on.
4371.84,4375.84, I think that's a cool idea if they're going to make a game for console that's based off of a hard
4375.84,4376.84, question.
4376.84,4377.84, Do you make the to me?
4377.84,4380.84," This is one of those like, you know, this is like one of those."
4380.84,4390.84," So it's like a piece of the sort of, you know, kind of the size of the appocalypse, you know, from the old days, in the old days, the idea that civilization would be on the console would be like, you know, I don't know."
4390.84,4394.84," When Satan comes to Earth maybe, you know, until then forget it."
4394.84,4398.84," And, uh, I think for access so far from what I've seen,"
4398.84,4402.84, I need to see more has done a kind of amazing job of translating.
4402.84,4406.84," I mean, they, they, it's definitely civil tight to some extent, you know,"
4406.84,4412.360000000001," you know, there's just absolutely no way they could translate the complexity of the PC game,"
4412.360000000001,4417.56," you know, intact to the console. But, but playing at times and I'm just going to, I guess"
4417.56,4421.96," I'm going to save this for next week because I don't want to, uh, blow it in terms of what"
4421.96,4428.04," I'm supposed to be talking about or not, but, uh, almost, not in every case, but in many,"
4428.04,4434.28," many cases when I was wondering, can the game do this? It could, in fact, it would be yes."
4435.16,4439.5599999999995, Yet there were other things that were that were simplified. One thing that is very pleased with
4439.5599999999995,4443.16, because it always becomes an issue when we're talking about strategy games on the console was the
4443.16,4448.36," control scheme was, was perfect with the control. I didn't even think about it after two minutes"
4448.36,4453.639999999999," moving the units around on the, on the world of math that they want at all. Which is just a"
4453.639999999999,4459.24," superficial point. I, I guess I got to save the bigger points. I'm, I will just say the, the early"
4459.24,4464.92," word as I was really pleasantly surprised that they, that they pulled it off. I think like,"
4465.88,4471.4," hardcore PC, save players who already have the PC and have, so for, even, so three,"
4472.92,4478.5199999999995, maybe there's not going to be as much reason to play this if you already have both machines.
4479.08,4482.76," Why would you want to play the console version? I don't know, but I think it's going to be a good"
4482.76,4489.08," gateway drug for console players to maybe check out the PC version. The assuming they pick it up,"
4489.08,4492.84," though, I mean, that'll be interesting to see if people find it, I don't think they're like, hey,"
4492.84,4496.84," this is what I want to try or heard about this. How's that box going to look on the shelf, say, in"
4496.84,4503.8," between, yeah, it's in my own box. I haven't seen the box, I just got the, you know, a gold master,"
4503.8,4509.88," but yeah, I mean, that's true because it is a turn-based strategy game and, you know, even in this,"
4509.96,4514.92," it's simplified state. It took me hours to play one game. This is not your typical,"
4514.92,4519.64," quote unquote typical console experience. I don't know, our console games. It's turned"
4519.64,4523.64," based strategy. Well, that's strategy, so much as maybe real playing games. They, they totally"
4523.64,4528.2," exist, but they usually come from Japan. Yeah. They get like your cul-de-seps and your, yeah,"
4528.2,4531.8," this guy isn't all those other ones like that. Right. I mean, I guess it's the most"
4531.8,4537.32," same who's publishing it, yeah. Yeah, I don't even know that. I was going to say, I mean, I"
4537.32,4542.44," could know. I guess it's a two k-recipe, two k-recipe. I think I think as long as whoever's publishing it,"
4542.44,4546.84," two k doesn't have like expectations. Like this is going to sell four million copies,"
4546.84,4554.12," like as long as they keep it realistic, but yeah, this was not GTA. Yeah. Right. And I think they probably"
4554.12,4558.92," have looked at data. It's more of a niche idea, whatever, who's done when they released it on consoles."
4558.92,4563.4," Yeah. I mean, but I think like long time console fans who are just like, what does deal with this"
4563.48,4568.92, damn civilization thing? I think this is a good accurate representation of what that is.
4568.92,4575.08," You know, so that's that. More to come, more to come. And I will take a break."
4575.799999999999,4578.759999999999, We'll come back with more.
4593.719999999999,4600.36," Sean Elliott is drifting off because of this weekend of of Conan playing Conan poop socking,"
4600.36,4604.92, but before you fall asleep for good. I do have more dramatic readings from the Conan
4604.92,4610.759999999999," Conan comic. Oh, yeah. Oh, I should have you're right. I blew that intro. We were supposed to do"
4610.759999999999,4615.4," that every 10 minutes. That's right. We forgot to take a C.A.S. through the end. Damn it. I play, I read it for the story."
4616.44,4622.5199999999995," Three to couple now and I'll overdub them later. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good idea. Pepper. Yeah,"
4622.68,4629.400000000001," Pepper. But you have a book recommendation for us, I believe. Yeah, it's Sean's been a"
4629.400000000001,4634.120000000001, awesome. I've recommended a book. And figure out the talk about this one because it's one of
4634.120000000001,4638.52," those books where you know, you can recommend it to anyone and they'll enjoy it. You know, to be"
4638.52,4647.320000000001, super specific. So I gave it to Sean. I know you've read some of it. It's called US guys or us guys.
4647.320000000001,4651.96," Oh, you're recommending that on the forum. Right. Yeah. The threatened by Charlie Lidoff"
4652.76,4657.72, the concept of the thing is that basically it was actually produced in conjunction with what was to be a
4657.72,4663.400000000001, TV series. I don't know where it aired though. And it sounds like it never did. Yeah. It sounds like maybe
4663.400000000001,4668.6," that's why it's a book now. Something happened. Well, he was going to do both all along. But I just didn't"
4668.6,4674.200000000001," know like he says he specifically cannot mention the title of the series, which means that like to"
4674.200000000001,4680.68," me something happened. Okay. Okay. So but basically, you know, part of the participatory journalism"
4681.320000000001,4686.68, he was going to go around the country and basically do different things with American males
4687.72,4694.84," representing, hopefully representing a wide range of masculinity in the country. And so some of the,"
4694.84,4700.200000000001," you know, the situations he went to join a bunch of reenactors at the Battle of Little Big Horn."
4701.240000000001,4706.68, And that was pretty interesting. Another example for going to any detail on specifics. He went to a
4706.68,4711.8," fight club in Oakland. I was surprised to hear is right on San Pablo, which is, you know,"
4711.8,4716.76," just street that we each live a couple of months. Yeah. And this was a real deal. So he ended up,"
4716.76,4720.84," you know, he, you know, he, you know, since his participant and all this stuff he ended up getting"
4720.84,4728.84, in fights there. The fall of 300 pound guy as well over six foot four or something. And he went to
4729.0,4738.52," gay rodeo somewhere. He went to Burning Man, hung out with circus performers for traveling,"
4738.52,4744.2," circus camera. And just like all this other stuff was just, oh, the one that was that really got"
4744.2,4748.52," me, I think was like the, it was like Detroit wasn't it the crime scene stuff. That one I'm not at"
4748.52,4754.2," yet. He works with, yes, just some homicide detectives there. And each, the thing about this book is"
4754.28,4759.639999999999, that it's a quick and easy read for anyone. But each chapter is its own self-contained story.
4759.639999999999,4765.48," And it's just so well written. It's narrative form as well. And I just think, I mean, for one"
4765.48,4768.76," part of it, I was getting it as a writer. It was like, look at how, like if you're even slightly"
4768.76,4773.639999999999," interested in narrative reporting, look at how he's, you know, handling all this stuff. And"
4774.599999999999,4778.5199999999995," and it's just fascinating too. Just the range of stuff. I mean, like people could, you know,"
4778.5199999999995,4782.679999999999," charge him with, with picking all these freak show things rather than just going in hanging out"
4782.68,4786.76," and any random bar and stuff. I mean, he's doing like he does. He goes to have some mail modeling"
4787.4800000000005,4793.08," thing in New York. So it's pretty extreme mail. Yes. And of some spectrum. But there's like,"
4793.08,4797.400000000001, there's something of everyone in every group that he's going to have. Like if it's like the
4797.400000000001,4801.88," the fight club thing, you're like, you know, he connects it to his own story of him and his brothers"
4801.88,4806.4400000000005," fighting, you know, and you're like, you totally deal with that. I mean, if, like, no matter what the"
4806.4400000000005,4811.240000000001," circumstances are, there's something that you can, you know, like, yeah, this is an extreme"
4811.32,4816.28, circumstance that he's pulling sort of this insight from. And like he's doing that in part to
4816.28,4821.08," entertain us and because it was going to be a TV series, you know. But there's, uh, I don't know."
4821.08,4826.12," I mean, I just appreciate like every, all that you sat in off on it, but every single entry I"
4826.12,4832.679999999999," read in and I really, I really liked. Yeah, I found I found the same sort of insight, despite the fact that"
4832.679999999999,4835.719999999999," they're talking about, you know, a circus trap. These artists who doesn't know anything else,"
4835.719999999999,4840.36," but circus trap. These artists. Yeah. Like I found something in there like, oh yeah, I can,"
4840.44,4843.639999999999," I can relate to what he's going through there. Even though when you think about it, it's like,"
4843.639999999999,4847.719999999999, there's no fucking way I can relate to what this guy's going through. Right. Right. Maybe that would have
4847.719999999999,4852.28," been on the extreme. And for me, double so because those performers were, you know, they were all"
4852.28,4857.0," from Latin America and they had, you know, much radically different histories. But,"
4857.719999999999,4863.4," for me, it's putting like my, my dumb life and perspective sometimes you're just like, man, I got"
4863.4,4867.88," it easy. Yeah. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. It is just like another, we are like, wow, or even"
4867.88,4870.84," looking at that problem. Nothing. Appreciating when you're like, oh, they're here. Come to the"
4870.84,4874.84," carnival again. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I'll make the carnit jokes. But like here's the gear,"
4874.84,4879.72," some insight into, yeah. And they're talking about how Obama is carnival seller in America, you know,"
4880.52,4886.84," pulling down 30 K for his family of eight or whatever. Yeah. Oh, my lord, you have to travel around"
4886.84,4889.0," to a bunch of people who don't appreciate what you're doing. He's like,"
4889.96,4895.0," pining for being back in Europe where, you know, if a circus is an art form and not some"
4895.96,4900.2, freak show thing that people laugh at or they go to and actually want to see and they can stay
4900.76,4905.0," in a town for like a whole month at a time and, you know, taking all the pictures. One thing,"
4905.0,4908.2, the performers did tell us kind of something about ourselves. When they're calming on the
4908.2,4913.32," difference between rural and urban audiences and how they love to, they think it's great to go"
4913.32,4917.88," out into the sticks and do their circus. But if they have these city folk that are, they go there"
4917.88,4923.16," and it's like, what are you going to show? What do you got for me? Nobody got a mind joke."
4923.72,4929.5599999999995," Uh, sorry. Uh, it was, they go with, you know, and it would just be dramatically different"
4929.5599999999995,4933.5599999999995," impression depending on where they go. Did you, did you read the, there's a section on the,"
4933.5599999999995,4937.08," the battle a little big horned re-neck or should you read that? I am, that's one I'm on,"
4937.08,4941.32," halfway through. Maybe three quarters away through, so I might have, the thing that got me in there"
4941.32,4945.5599999999995," is not only the complexity of like the fact that like the Indian tribe that's playing,"
4946.599999999999,4951.5599999999995," the Indian tribe that fought and killed custard, right? It's the crow playing the suit, right? It's"
4951.72,4957.080000000001," the, so the seaworn involved and then, so there's, how, how do the crow see themselves playing this"
4957.080000000001,4962.4400000000005," part and then in relation to their real, you know, their, their ancestors real role in the circumstance,"
4962.4400000000005,4966.6," how, how are the suit dealing with it? What's up with the white people that are like, let's be"
4966.6,4971.4800000000005," custard, you know, like, and that guy is funny. The guy is always, he's interesting, but then it"
4971.4800000000005,4977.8," gets really cool when they actually start the re-enactment and a lot of the, the crow Indian guys,"
4978.76,4983.0, you get the sense that they just love this chance to get to beat the shit out of these white
4983.0,4988.28," guys, even if it's like for play and like they start roughing up like, uh, custard so bad that"
4988.28,4991.16," they're, they have to like pretty much like blow the whistle, they're like, guys already killed them"
4991.16,4995.400000000001," like six times and like they'll just keep killing certain people, like, which will be the way that"
4995.400000000001,4998.76," the re-enactment goes if they combine, they bonk you or hit you or something, you're supposed to either"
4998.76,5003.4800000000005, indicate that you're dead or he fight and if you want them to come back and shoot you up blank or
5003.48,5008.04," something, you know, right, blanking ball, but they keep doing it. And one guy is like he just says,"
5008.04,5012.28," you know, Charlie enough is like, this guy just absolutely smells like he's licked up and drunk and"
5012.28,5017.48," he's rough as you can imagine. He's like, I keep going down and pretending I'm dead, he's coming"
5017.48,5023.0," back to kill me again and again. It's just pretty like it had this, it's weird. I mean,"
5023.0,5029.4," dealing with the issue of why grown men play, you know, these terrible scenarios,"
5029.48,5034.92, there's racial stuff involved to throw into the powder cake. There's the explanations for why
5034.92,5038.839999999999," people do this on the face. It's like, oh, to preserve history, you know, but then there's like the"
5038.839999999999,5042.679999999999," way that they actually behave, you're checks out with, you know, with with what they're claiming"
5042.679999999999,5047.08, and it's really interesting. It's supposed you could probably even apply that sort of logic to the
5047.08,5052.12," historical war battles, all those old dudes were doing, like they would go do those things,"
5052.12,5056.12," except they just do with miniatures on a small scale. But they're definitely like, I want to be"
5056.12,5062.36," the zooleway, keep their costume clean. It was interesting that when the guys for"
5062.36,5066.92," Stockard Clear Sky came in another week, I was asking the producer what was going on with the"
5066.92,5072.2," pictures I've seen online of Larkbors. Well, I thought that they were Larkbors and to turn out"
5072.2,5078.36," that yeah, they are. But you basically sell these people in, you know, the real Ukrainian exclusion zone"
5078.36,5084.12," dressed up like Stockard characters and whatnot. So we told, you know, it was like, yeah, what we do"
5084.2,5090.599999999999," about 300 people participate in these will spend a month or two preparing deciding who's going to be,"
5090.599999999999,5095.4," you know, the salesmen, the shopkeepers and stuff who are going to be this class of mutant and"
5095.4,5099.08, what's going to go on and then they all go out with their air soft rifles and do this stuff. So
5100.12,5105.16," the first thing is doing it in that area in this, I don't know like exactly how obviously they're"
5105.16,5112.04," not like right on the immediate outskirts of the reactor itself. At least I hope they're not,"
5112.12,5120.5199999999995, that's not worth life action cancer. Realism is okay. Really have radiation. Yeah. Awesome.
5121.16,5124.92," But as soon as I heard that, I was like, oh, shit, I would love to go. It's a basically copy"
5124.92,5129.8," little off and go and join in on these guys, the shenanigans, you know, we'd obviously don't have"
5129.8,5134.04," the butt to send me. Why are they doing it specifically? Is it for the next game? No, it's not"
5134.04,5138.36, to promote the game or anything. It's just the game's popular there. People like the universe and
5138.36,5144.839999999999, the fiction and it had. It was based on that story from there. They just like it and they
5144.839999999999,5148.44, want to learn. They got air soft guns and they have spare gas masks and they can
5149.32,5153.4, throw some burlap over that and turn themselves into a zone. So right here. But so
5154.679999999999,5158.04," as I got first thing, I was like, it would be rad to go over here and actually do this, do a"
5158.04,5162.2," story on it. That wasn't, that wasn't going to happen. It was only time, you know, that's why"
5162.2,5165.88," we always send like freelance, there's like Robert and stuff when you know in Evan when there's"
5165.96,5172.04," these events and you know, Moscow and Helsinki and all these other cool places. But I think"
5172.04,5176.12," I do have Robert is, you know, starting to talk with them and work out the story on this."
5176.84,5183.08," Interestingly, I was looking at some, you know, other leads for it where, you know, what will happen."
5183.08,5187.32, I imagine like Robert write a story and it's going to be based on this one specific thing. But
5187.32,5192.4400000000005," it'll also talk around the larger phenomena of game-based, larping to put this in context."
5192.44,5196.599999999999, Like these guys aren't just operating in a vacuum. But I was searching for links and stuff for them.
5196.599999999999,5202.12," And I found one, it was crazy. People live action Sonic the hedgehog, larp, I mean, well of course"
5202.12,5208.12," they're larp, but Sonic the hedgehog larpers and they have skateboard ramps and roller blades and shit."
5209.24,5212.44, So that's how you do that's how you do the loops. Lark Sonic the hedgehog.
5214.44,5217.32, Sounds insane. They're there. Marty tells here that we don't want to know.
5217.32,5222.84," Vegetables. So I'm not asking roller, roller blade, half pipe maneuvers with a fucking sonic mask on."
5223.639999999999,5229.4, And nothing else. Go for rings. I wonder if they have some toss like they spray paint who loops
5229.4,5234.44, gold and have some throw those to collect us there. Is there going up back and forth on their ramp?
5235.32,5239.32," Yeah, let's say a lot on there, right? We know the answer to that already. People have"
5240.12,5244.44," invented many, many things. You don't even need to set for that. You know, you're better."
5245.4,5249.0, I got to see dark on. Is that that any of that movie? Dark on?
5249.0,5253.16," Some of documentary about larping. No, but I want to see it now. Whatever it is."
5253.16,5256.679999999999, It's been like in the making for the longest time. I mean they've had like the trailers up.
5256.679999999999,5258.839999999999, I figure it's got to be all right. That's what I.
5258.839999999999,5262.919999999999," Oh, yeah, it was the other thing that that convention I went to. They were showing regular films from this"
5262.919999999999,5268.5199999999995, professional larping group that they apparently film regular episodes for like a jam larping. Yeah.
5269.5599999999995,5273.5599999999995, And it's like a continuous thing about this group to their larping adventures.
5274.679999999999,5278.599999999999, Authenth find out the name of it. This reminds me we should republish
5279.639999999999,5285.96, at Haltor's story about just sorts of it. It had some some coverage of larping. It had
5287.4,5290.5199999999995," nerd core rappers and stuff. Oh, right. That was a good story ahead. Yeah,"
5291.4,5296.12," I'm surprised we haven't done that yet. Yeah, that was back in the print mag days. Yeah, let's get that story."
5296.12,5301.32," It's about the online. Yeah, you missed it. The information super highway. We can post your"
5301.32,5303.32, next to a map. Tripoli.
5308.12,5311.799999999999," Here's your story plus a map of Fresno. Yeah, for all time sake."
5314.5199999999995,5320.12," Oh boy, I think we're done. Yeah, we're done. We're done. We're done. We're sorry. It's post Memorial Day. You know,"
5320.12,5329.0, got a tired group here. We did our best to service you. Let us know if you were happy with what you
5329.08,5339.24," received. And if not PM Jeff, not enough. No, no, I'll hand it up. I'll weep"
5339.24,5345.24, a weep quietly to myself late at night. Or maybe not so quietly. Maybe I'll blubber
5345.24,5350.28," openly. Yeah, go for it. Yeah, I'll blubber. Why don't you bring us up with the somewhere? Yeah, like the"
5350.28,5355.32," ending of Conan the ending? Yeah, I don't know if it was just end of a resounding. How can it not?"
5355.4,5361.16," Yeah, unless it's a cliffhanger. Could be continued in your own. No, it says finis at the end. Oh,"
5361.16,5369.0," well, that means sorry. The last page of the sort of the Samarion. It's a fill in the gaps. Okay."
5369.5599999999995,5374.599999999999," Yeah, you write you can just have to create your own story between the beginning and the end. Here's the end."
5376.84,5383.16, Night winged thoughts split across Conan's brain memories of the dread deeds of the day just
5384.04,5390.76, the slaying of a valiant friend. The marvels of an invisible word revealed images of many
5390.76,5398.36, towered cities and dying continents and and and kings. That was written there and it
5398.36,5406.5199999999995," ellipses and and kings. I wasn't there something about the kingdom, a vision of Conan as monarch"
5406.6,5414.84, of some unguessed at land but already the image fades too long ago and too fantastic to trouble
5414.84,5422.280000000001, the mind of a youth who has neither dagger nor venison to sustain him. More a little bit of stories.
5422.280000000001,5429.0, The mower was one more here. This you either pk or press one. The moon is a white watching eye.
5429.72,5434.44, The journey home is hard and there are no realities worth the wishing.
5435.56,5440.44, Say food and a finely wrought sword sounds like a penthouse letter.
5440.44,5448.04, Genius. It's actually yeah in the last images as of him in his sexy loincloth walking off into the night.
5450.04,5455.08, Follow me young man. And with that we walk off into the night. We we walk off bearish.
5455.08,5461.96, Show us in our loincloth. The gs w barbarians. We should be back to fight another battle next week.
5464.12,5470.04, Good dog. Fucking edit that. Look at this. The female I carried from the cave is changed into one of
5470.04,5475.64," the wing demons. As he says, as he jumps right in front of the female he's talking about."
5475.64,5481.0," Oh, he says that's not a narrative. Oh, yes. Yeah. That's good stuff. All right. Okay."
5481.0,5487.56, We'll be back next week with our green grand great stuff. Actually here. There's a final sound for this podcast.
5489.0,5493.72," Oh, that's a sad of shot ripping the car in coma. Common book in half."
5495.56,5496.28, Bye.
