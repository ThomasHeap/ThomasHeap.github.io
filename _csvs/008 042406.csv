0.0,6.4," Hello and welcome again to the C.D.W. podcast. This is Jeff Green, Editor and Chief of Computer"
6.4,13.280000000000001, Gaming World Magazine and with me once again are the editors of computer gaming world in
13.280000000000001,21.52," all their glory and they are as follows. Ryan Scott, Sean Elliott, Terry Leston and our wonderful"
21.52,27.68, sound man. Scott as well. Mayor may not talk. Hi my who knows. If we're interesting enough
27.68,34.32, for Scott Hill chime in. I wanted to start off with one quick reader letter that we got. We got
34.32,41.44," two emails in a row about our lovely former managing editor, Kristen, Salvador. I just wanted to read"
41.44,48.72," one because it's been making me laugh. Hello as a VP of development for a large engineering firm,"
48.72,54.32, I don't usually go gaga over pretty faces but Kristen is something else. Is there any way I
54.32,61.12," could center a small token of my admiration, perhaps a small diamond ring or dinner in Paris? Here's"
61.12,66.4," my favorite part. By the way, I also have an extra American Express card and love to go shoe shopping."
67.44,71.12, So what I want to know is what does he mean by extra American Express card? What does that mean?
71.12,77.92, Extra. I just have one. He has one that he has with his wife and then the other for the random
77.92,85.68," woman. He picks up on editorial staffs. He's gaming mistress. So what I wanted to tell you, Jay,"
86.16000000000001,91.12, the way you can send her a small token of your admiration is at
92.08,99.92," Oh, because that's where she is now and I'm sure she'd love to hear her from you."
100.72,106.24000000000001," So you know, we're going to have to talk about that. Don't edit this out."
107.52000000000001,115.52000000000001, I'm sorry Kristen. I can see the thousands upon thousands of emails she's now going to receive.
115.52000000000001,120.16," Okay, this was actually just my evil plot to break PC gamers mail server."
121.2,127.12, There you go. Can I read the other one about Kristen? Come on. It's just one sentence.
127.12,130.72," All right. Okay, thanks. Thanks Ryan. I've asked you everything. I do from Ryan. I can't."
130.72,135.92000000000002," I can't. I can't. I can't. Okay, this one goes. I've been subscribing to CGW for a few years now"
135.92000000000002,140.48000000000002," and I've always considered myself straight. But after seeing Kristen with her whip,"
140.48000000000002,145.92000000000002, I'm not so sure anymore. That's from Jessica. I might be the best letter we've ever got.
145.92000000000002,150.56, And now the show's over. Thank you everyone. Good night. And remember to zip your way to it.
150.56,157.12," So Kristen doesn't work or anymore. We're sorry Jessica, but but we went to mind if you came by still because that's a pretty hot letter."
159.36,163.68, You were saving that up all week. Wait a minute. This is Sine. Jessie.
163.68,170.48000000000002, Uncle Jessie. Oh no. That changes my whole world view. I feel very nervous inside.
170.48000000000002,176.16," I keep imagine Uncle Jessie is overall. I still want to meet him. Okay, that that's so"
176.16,179.84, nervous. I think this is out of the way. Let's get on to the important business of gaming.
179.84,190.4, Harrom. Last week here in. No Harrom thing. Last week here was the glorious pre-e3 week for
190.4,195.44," those of us in the gaming business. If you don't know what pre-e3 is, I guess first of all,"
195.44,201.04," you have to know what e3 is, which is the entertainment. Wait, electronic entertainment expo"
201.04,206.07999999999998," that they hold every year in Los Angeles, which is sort of like the big gaming industry."
207.68,214.88, Shindig to do what do you want to call it? Flipping off of Hollywood. It's it's the big
214.88,218.64, convention of the gaming business where all the companies make their big announcements for the
218.64,223.2," year. Everybody has their press conferences and shows us stuff that we see five years from now,"
223.2,230.23999999999998," et cetera, et cetera. And over the years, all the game companies started to realize that"
231.04,236.64," the press, they can never get our attention at e3 for various reasons. The reasons including"
237.51999999999998,244.32, that we're hung over every day were overbooked every day. What are the other reasons?
244.32,247.68," Well, just so many announcements happening at once. It just gets everything just lost in the noise."
247.68,253.68," Right. So many greasy grommets holding swag bags in line. Yeah, we're trying to get the lines"
253.68,258.32, of 400 guys wanting to get their photo taken. It was back in city of Yolanda Cape.
258.4,261.59999999999997, It's a cake. It looks like a napkin type of internet. It's like something some
261.59999999999997,265.76, dude from Shikki's Game Shack trying to like it. I'm actually going to go for the fun part.
265.76,270.24," You know, it's just you're too busy looking at the booth beds. Oh, you don't even have that anymore. Sorry."
270.24,274.24," Oh, they killed them. That's right. Yeah. Actually, actually, I never looked once at them."
274.24,286.4," Yeah, I respect my wife. Hi, hi, dear. Yeah, so anyway, E3 has always been a, it's always fun"
286.47999999999996,291.2," but for the presence of it's a bit manic. Well, it's manic for everybody. But, but it's very hard for"
291.2,296.08, to get our attention as press people and to focus on the games they have to show. So somewhere along
296.08,299.91999999999996," the lines, one of the companies came up with a brilliant idea. I don't know who started. I was"
299.91999999999996,307.44," Microsoft was Microsoft. Yeah, with Game Shack. Yeah, to have an event before E3 where they got our"
307.44,311.44," undivided attention, they didn't have to share it with any other game company. Well,"
312.16,317.84," now they all do them. So over the course of one week. So basically, now before the week of E3,"
317.84,322.96, we have another week that's basically just E3 all over again. And it's getting worse now.
322.96,326.32," It almost seems like there's like other companies that don't like, you know, there's the big ones,"
326.32,330.72," you know, activation, you'll be soft EA. They have it that this one consolidated week, but then"
330.72,335.52, there are other companies that kind of do it a couple of weeks before that. So it turns into like a month of E3 now.
335.52,340.72, Yeah. And then they do special events for the judges for the E3 judges.
341.68,344.4," Part of it though, I think we should be thankful for. I think it's a nod to,"
345.2,349.28, let's imprint with our lead times so that when we can put out an issue that comes out around the
349.28,355.44," time of the show and we're looking at the same stuff, not a month later. Right. No, you're probably"
355.44,360.24," right. Oh, yeah. And also really, truly, if we take advantage of it, it is a way to actually see these"
360.24,367.52," games and not have to fight the crowds, the Lump and Mass E3. Well, there's a lot of stuff that"
367.59999999999997,371.84," I mean, they don't even show you at those events though. In like EA just announced"
374.0,378.88," CNC to an conqueror. In a conqueror, yes. Right. You know, we didn't see that or sport."
380.71999999999997,383.76," Well, it's just, it's just attacking a lot of companies doing it's like,"
383.76,388.47999999999996," well, T's you come and you know, come spend like five hours at our pre E3 event and then"
388.47999999999996,392.64," and then dedicated another, you know, hour or two to seeing the rest of the games at the show or"
392.64,397.28," like, we'll give you a teaser of the game. Right. Right. I mean, all the cool stuff we ever see is"
397.28,402.4," behind closed doors at E3, right? It's never the stuff that's out there on the floor and they"
402.4,407.91999999999996," weren't really showing anything in pre E3 that was the behind closed door stuff, right? Or did they?"
407.91999999999996,412.23999999999995," Um, it's so, I think it knew we saw if they did a couple, a couple, a little of that, but yeah,"
412.23999999999995,416.96," obviously, NBA is signed. I can't say anything yet. Yeah. So we saw some cool stuff and we can't talk"
416.96,422.32," to you about it. Ha ha ha. It's increasingly tied to exclusives and cover stories to say,"
423.04,429.2," about sport. We've got nothing and complain about, but right. So a lot of that going on. Right."
429.2,436.71999999999997," Now we, not it's true. We have the, uh, the sport cover story for our June issue, which is no secret."
436.71999999999997,442.96," People know that. I mean, I've blocked about it before, but uh, but EA wasn't showing it at their"
442.96,448.0," pre E3 day. That's good for us though. I mean, guarantees that, you know, shaky,"
448.0,451.68," game check doesn't go on the beat our story. You know, there is a shaky game check and it's"
451.68,455.68," probably going to like, plug in a Sue us now or something. Uh, yeah, don't knock. We're not talking about"
455.68,462.16," game check. We're talking about C. I mean, SEC, sick couple X or seasonaries from Sweden."
462.16,465.76, You're going to be applying for a job at check. He's game check if you get this as David's
465.76,472.64," in trouble. Um, sorry. I didn't mean to threaten you on air. That's a little tacky. I'm sorry,"
472.71999999999997,478.96," sure. Oh, about that. It's my sorry. It's not itself on the right. Uh, okay."
480.24,486.4," Before the spires even further at a control, let's move on to a question that that we got from the,"
487.12,493.36, from the listening audience. And I want to remind everybody to please send us your questions because
493.36,497.76, we didn't get that many this month. Maybe maybe we've already answered everything you ever need to
497.76,502.96," know. And so there's nothing left. But if you do have any questions, send a letter to C. G."
502.96,511.76, W letters at zifdavis.com with podcast in the subject line or just go to our message board at
511.76,519.76," C. G. W dot 1 up dot com. Now, this guy's question is, uh, he asks, how much should episodic"
519.76,526.64," content sell for? I forget where I read this, but sin is going to put its first episode into retail"
526.72,533.36," probably for $30 and both seem to be likely what's both. He mentions one game. Well, whatever,"
533.36,539.84," both seem likely to sell for $20 on steam. Maybe half life? Maybe. Yeah. Additionally, if you're"
539.84,544.96," only getting five to six hours of gameplay, doesn't 20 bucks seem a little high. So that's this"
544.96,550.56, question. I thought that was a good topic. How do we feel about what what what companies should be
550.56,556.2399999999999, charging for episodic game content? Get to ask us after we've played sin episodes in episode
556.2399999999999,561.68," who want. Well, let me ask this question. How many I don't remember because I did it in"
562.56,567.8399999999999, little spurts. How many hours solid gameplay was half life too? And that was what 50 bucks?
568.8,574.88," I did it my first time in about 11, 10 or 11 hours and I heard some people was about 16. Yeah,"
574.88,578.7199999999999," I mean, it depends on how much you explore the area, but I think I did it about like 18 or so."
579.36,586.5600000000001," Well, that's a good question in a way, right? I mean, are you getting less gaming per hour"
586.5600000000001,592.8000000000001," than you normally would anyway at a retail purchase? I guess it depends on the game, right?"
593.36,601.9200000000001," I mean, the recent downloads of the bone game, which has been an online only thing, it was"
601.9200000000001,606.96, disappointing to me at least the first one was because that was about three or four hours and they were
607.2,613.12, charging $20 and the whole notion of that game was they're going through the bone comic book over a series
613.12,621.2," of episodes that correspond to the to the books, to the comic books and each episode was going to cost $20."
621.84,626.88," Well, that means to play what would have in the old days been one adventure game for"
627.9200000000001,634.1600000000001," you know, whatever, 12 hours was now starting to cost a ridiculous amount of money, you know, $20"
634.16,641.4399999999999," a pop if it's a four episode, it's just $80. You know, there, I think there are other ways to make"
641.4399999999999,646.0799999999999," a more worth of money to a one of them that's in, it's still up in there up into the very last minute,"
646.0799999999999,653.92," but they're looking at implementing a number of multiplayer modes to it, some unique and in addition"
653.92,658.72," to that, some other mini games. So those, for example, would help you get more money out of it. I mean,"
658.72,663.28," if the multiplayer modes got any legs on it, it definitely would. And then other things like"
663.92,670.72," editors commentary, which will be in episode one. So not the biggest bonus in the world, but it"
670.72,674.8," definitely might want to play it through a second time, get some more hours out of it, and check it out."
674.8,679.76," I think the one thing, like, I remember from like, sin one back in the day was that they really kind"
679.76,683.04, of created this whole world that they kind of encourage you to kind of mess around with everything and
683.04,687.92," like push stuff around in the environment and like look for little hidden, you know, stuff everywhere."
687.92,691.1999999999999," And that kind of, that can kind of like after you go through the main mission, you can come back and"
691.2800000000001,694.48," that can add to some of the replayability, just look at those little hidden extras."
694.48,699.2800000000001," That's a good question too. I mean, do you think you guys will be more inclined to replay these,"
699.2800000000001,704.4000000000001," you know, single player games because you know, they're more doable in that time frame."
705.12,709.76," Because you know, say if you're going to fire up, uh, DSX again, you know, you've got a big chunk of"
709.76,715.12, investment there for you. I guess so. I guess that's true. Maybe I just wonder about the
715.12,720.08," price point on these things. You know, like once you start getting over a certain amount, it's just,"
720.08,725.84," like I'll start blocking it wanting to cough up that money. It's like buying music. It's easy to buy,"
725.84,734.8, spend 99 cents on an album or on a song or 999 on an album. But even the few times that I've been
734.8,741.2," on iTunes and for whatever reason, they've gone over the 999 over the sweet $10 spot. I start blocking."
741.6800000000001,747.36," You know, it starts seeming less like a casual investment. Well, I think, I mean, I guess the real trick"
747.36,753.6," will be like, what are some comparably priced like $20 expansions that have come out? And, you know,"
753.6,757.76," United offensive, how much was that? Or, um, Seagre weapons are World War II for, you know,"
757.76,762.8000000000001," Battlefield 2042, right? Same price. Well, I mean, it's a pretty huge, though. Right. I mean,"
762.8000000000001,767.44," like those added a lot for those games. I mean, it's kind of like, until I actually see the final"
767.5200000000001,771.5200000000001," package with it's kind of like, you know, going to wait and see. Maybe there's a lot more to it than just a"
771.5200000000001,778.24," simple six out of play through. Maybe we're getting caught on the, uh, the, uh, just the wording here."
778.24,785.9200000000001," Maybe episodic content sounds like well, if they do what Sean says where they have the the"
785.9200000000001,790.1600000000001," various types of multiplayer and the games within the games within the games, type of thing."
790.1600000000001,796.1600000000001," That might add to it's like, okay, you get a solid for the single player, timeline, you get a solid,"
796.16,801.8399999999999," you know, five to six hours of gameplay. But if you want to, you know, really, if you really want to"
801.8399999999999,807.28," dissect this puppy, you have a bunch of hidden little things in there and just like, go, we encourage"
807.28,812.0799999999999," you to go explore, which turns, double it, which turns it into 10 to 12 hours of gameplay."
812.0799999999999,816.56," Now, would that be worth 20 to 30 bucks? And then all the assets are open for being, for being, for being"
816.56,822.48," fully modelled. Yeah. I mean, would that, would that make it open? I mean, worth that, you know,"
822.5600000000001,828.0, 20 to 30 dollars? Yeah. Maybe. I guess it just would depend on the quality of that five or six
828.0,833.2," hours. And that was going to be my other question was, you know, how good is this game? Right."
833.2,839.44," I'm not one for, like I would much rather have a great short game than a, you know,"
839.44,844.8000000000001," half decent, long, long game. I never finished games anyway unless they're short and contained."
844.8000000000001,850.32," Right. Let's look at like some of, you know, CGW, everyone here would love to critic, not, um,"
850.4000000000001,854.0," Mike's, you know, I played both PC, review to proceed to WN console,"
854.0,859.0400000000001," to review for EGM, took me about six hours and I love the game. And I didn't really"
859.0400000000001,863.6, didn't have a problem with it at the time. So that's worth taking it in consideration. Another would
863.6,868.8000000000001," fear is a short game, condemned short game that's coming out of PC right now. Call of duty,"
868.8000000000001,873.2," too, it was relatively short. Yeah. It's longer than that. I mean, it was longer than"
873.2,877.2," Riddick. It was longer than Riddick. Yeah. But, but, but Riddick is specifically say because it"
877.2800000000001,881.76," doesn't, didn't have a multiplayer component, right? But it did have a director's commentary,"
881.76,887.5200000000001," sort of the originator of this, this sort of stuff we're seeing now on this steam episode type"
887.5200000000001,894.1600000000001," product. Mm-hmm. I'm all for, for digital downloads. I mean, I think it's a great idea. I just wonder,"
894.88,899.6800000000001," you know, if they, if they're pricing these episodes correctly, and maybe right with all the"
899.6800000000001,906.0," stuff you're getting here from send, maybe that is a decent price. I think yeah, it,"
906.08,909.92, definitely it's a question we should come back to once this product starts coming out because if it's
909.92,914.16," not good, it'll be really easy to answer. Actually, now let's just really pontificating and we'll say about"
914.16,918.0," something we don't know. Right, right. It if it's great, I think we'll be happy with it. You know,"
918.0,922.4," you stroke our chains. It's like comic books, you know, you spend four bucks for an issue sometimes."
922.4,927.2," Half the time, you can't believe you did it. Other time, yeah. I could live with that. Yeah,"
927.2,932.72," you know, I've been clean sweeping my house and I, I, I found and it find they're sitting right there"
932.8000000000001,937.84, every day to stare at the four long boxes of comics in my house because I quit reading like
938.64,945.2, it's almost like two years now. And I contemplated actually just taking the long boxes out
945.2,951.36," onto the sidewalk just with a, you know, free, take me sign. And I just couldn't do it because I thought,"
952.24,956.88," do you know how much money that is? Maybe you can't. I mean, I don't think of all the other"
956.88,960.88, stuff that you bought and you have later on your house that you don't explain old shoes. You're
960.88,965.84," not thinking yourself. That's like $800 worth of shoes right there. I mean, but for some reason"
965.84,970.08," with comics because the lie when we're kids, no, the lie is that you're going to, that this is"
970.08,973.68," an investment. You're going to get your money back. But that's all, yes, you know. I mean, yeah."
973.68,977.84," And let's you have to buy a corn, pristine condition comics and it's more painful with the"
977.84,982.8," comic books. Maybe this is just my Jewish guilt or something. But I feel like money, it's also like a"
982.8,987.76," testament of wasted money. You know, like the shoes you got to wear shoes, right? So of course,"
987.84,991.68, you're always going to buy them and you're going to wear them out. And so they had a good life.
991.68,997.12," But with the comics, it's like I'm looking at thousands of dollars that I invested. And like,"
997.12,1003.12, and now I don't care about them. So why did I buy all of us? What about your old VHS tapes?
1003.12,1007.68," Then there you've got, like, a four time four or something like that sitting around. I know it."
1008.4,1013.76," Anyway, maybe. So hey, we could, we could tie in back to the games by, by we're talking about"
1013.84,1018.88, price and right. Are we willing to pay certain things? One solution that we all know to driving
1018.88,1025.04," costs down is advertising. It does news noted that they said, wait, that's a nice, that's a"
1025.04,1029.28, beautiful. That was pretty good. I think Sean's going to be the new segue guy. Okay. Okay.
1029.28,1035.68," They're just going to point you for the job. It's there. All right. So today, there was a, well,"
1035.68,1041.28," across the wire came out news that cool reality games, the guys who made the, like, the war games"
1041.36,1044.72," series for right, they started getting in on the corporate sponsored ad"
1044.72,1050.8," regaming. So basically, the full free experience, but you get the deal with free ad basically as well."
1050.8,1054.32," So there's a product placement. Ah, it's all about product placement. Three. Yeah,"
1054.32,1059.12," episode. So the, so it's the episode. The game is called the Dino Hunters."
1060.72,1064.08, Sorry. Yeah. Exactly. So I think this beginning was captured.
1064.08,1069.44," No, and so it's the dinosaur. It's the dinosaur hunt. It's like the back of the"
1069.44,1074.3200000000002," thing like trying to connect the dots and create it. Yeah. Exactly. There we go. So so basically,"
1074.3200000000002,1079.52," this is the first episode brought to you by Chick Quattro, the, the, the, the path for the"
1079.52,1083.6000000000001," skin is to stay there with a straight face. No, it's like, yeah, for the, for your dinosaur,"
1083.6000000000001,1087.92, to get the smoothest shape possible. Is that that's the four blade one? That's the Quattro.
1087.92,1094.16, I guess the Quattro would kind of factor. It's five. You totally use it for that extra scale.
1094.16,1101.28," Anyway, so it's written by a former EIC of Maxim Magazine. Okay. And it's using, I think the half-life"
1101.28,1106.0, one half-life one. And it's two. It's two. It's two. It's two. It's so sensitive. It's so weird. So basically what
1106.0,1112.3200000000002," you do is you start off, it's just really tacky stuff and you're, I don't just, you grab a, you grab"
1112.3200000000002,1116.16," bazooka and you fire a pair of, what about before that? What about when you, when you're shaving"
1116.16,1120.16," yourself before you go dinosaur, you know, that's right. Well, with the Quattro. Well, actually,"
1120.16,1125.52," no, it's one of the NPC is shaving himself in the mirror. Okay. Okay. And then you see some"
1125.52,1131.92," cheesy babe and she walks over and do you get a Quattro as a, as a weapon? Sadly no. That would be nice."
1131.92,1136.48," Like the razor gun and not, right? Oh, but that would be a bad message. You know, bad, you know,"
1136.48,1142.48," you start a product to tell your classmates kind of thing. Right? To kill you, to kill you,"
1142.48,1148.16," they bring to your dinosaurs. So I watched over her, Darren, I heard it crashing your computer."
1148.16,1152.72," And so I, I hear this, I mean, you've got a really nice rig over there. So I walk over,"
1152.72,1156.5600000000002," and I hear it. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Well, so you've got, I don't know,"
1156.5600000000002,1161.2," what do you got some unreal, you got, I got a DJ remix of like dives? No, I thought I was like,"
1161.2,1165.28," well, maybe you got like UT 2007 or something in your computers, not, not up to it after all"
1165.28,1172.0800000000002," instead. I see this very assy looking, you know, not using the source engine well game and"
1172.0800000000002,1176.88, and you're basically using half life two weapons with the same audio. Yeah. The shoot
1176.96,1182.48," paired actals and whatever. But hey, it's a free game. Well, we're not going to get any advertising"
1182.48,1188.24," from the quadro people on CGW. We didn't, it's that out. Well, they're not trash in the air."
1188.24,1191.92," They're, they're just trash in the game. Right, actually it's a fine razor."
1191.92,1196.5600000000002," Mm-hmm. Oh, geez. Wow. You know, actually, you know what,"
1196.5600000000002,1200.3200000000002," I looked, he was very clean shape. You know, I guess I just thought baby,"
1200.3200000000002,1205.8400000000001," shes, maybe, maybe, face move. No, I mean, I like the idea of having, giving me a game for free,"
1206.8,1211.4399999999998, I don't mind the idea of like advertising games as long as it's context.
1211.4399999999998,1216.1599999999999," Yeah, I don't mind that idea is like the same, you know, what Robert's touched on in"
1216.1599999999999,1221.52," Scourge Earth before you basically go to the Tides spot and wash your clothes, mini-game or whatever,"
1221.52,1226.1599999999999," you know, right. Right. And it's like that. But it's, I mean, it's compared to that sort of thing."
1226.1599999999999,1231.28," I guess I would take it back. Did you guys ever tell you guys when Budweiser, when I got called in by that"
1232.24,1237.6," at campaign that, no, it was by these marketing folks working with Budweiser."
1237.6,1243.04," Because this is right after Everquest had got really hit a big. And somebody in the, in the"
1243.04,1249.52," Budweiser organization or maybe their PR firm read about it and said, hey, this online charging"
1249.52,1254.3999999999999," people, every month thing is great. Maybe this is another way for Budweiser to make money."
1254.3999999999999,1259.28," So they came up with the idea for basically like, I'm not making this up. It was like,"
1259.36,1264.32," World of Budweiser, you know, they didn't, that's not what they call it. But it was like a Budweiser,"
1264.32,1271.04, a Budweiser massive multiplayer game set in Budweiser land. I guess I don't know. You just drink
1271.04,1276.72," beer going quest for beer or something. So they actually called me in to get, uh, to get my take on it."
1276.72,1280.96," You know, what do you think is a gaming editor of this Budweiser massive multiplayer game?"
1280.96,1285.92," And it was, it was unbelievable to me that they even took it seriously enough to bring somebody"
1286.0,1289.8400000000001," in to talk about it. They were wasting their time. Because once I sat down and was telling them,"
1289.8400000000001,1294.5600000000002," like, well, you know, if you do this kind of thing, like you have to have servers,"
1295.44,1300.72, you have to buy servers. You have to maintain them. You have to have people online 247.
1300.72,1305.68," You have to keep making content for people to play. I mean, basically by the time I got out of the"
1305.68,1309.44," office, I had them convince to just do like flash-based, you know."
1310.4,1316.0, I saw a Terragame with the Budweiser logo. Yeah. You guys may want to aim a little lower.
1316.0,1320.4," I can't see people down, not, maybe not us, but I can't see people downloading,"
1320.4,1324.4," dying on her. And the reason being is when we were researching 100, one free game story,"
1324.4,1330.4, I was playing a game called Warrock. And it's kind of like the unemployed man's answer to battlefield.
1330.4,1335.6000000000001, Then I was playing it thinking that it was just going to be vacant. But there were a lot of people
1335.6799999999998,1341.04," in there. Very, very full servers. And I asked the people, what are you guys doing? What are"
1341.04,1346.48, you tools doing here? And they were just angry that I thought that that was a question we're
1346.48,1351.4399999999998," asking. I mean, they love Warrock. But I think it was also because they haven't experienced"
1351.4399999999998,1355.36, with anything else besides Warrock. So I think there's people. The price is right. The moral
1355.36,1359.52, that price is right. There's some dino hunters out there in the making. I guess so. But do
1359.52,1364.8799999999999, it do anybody have a problem with like real like advertising in in their games? Like if you drive
1364.88,1369.2800000000002, by you're playing a racing game and you drive by a Pepsi add-to-side bug you?
1369.2800000000002,1373.3600000000001, Don't they already have that in there though? Well they do. I'm asking if you think that's a problem.
1373.3600000000001,1377.68, I think that'd be a great way for companies to actually sell their products in its days.
1377.68,1381.68," And more importantly, be actually a really great if they would help make games cheaper."
1381.68,1387.0400000000002," Right. I mean, instead of having a pay 50 bucks per game, make it 25 or 30 if you have"
1387.0400000000002,1391.5200000000002, contact sensitive ads in the game. I think it's obvious that this is going to happen more and more.
1391.6,1396.8799999999999," I mean, these advertisers are looking at kids watching TV less because they're playing video games."
1396.8799999999999,1401.68, They're going to want to go to where the eyeballs are. It's the same reason that like the US Army
1401.68,1406.24," made America's Army, right? Well, these kids aren't going to see our Army ads on television."
1406.24,1411.12, So let's make them a game. I think they even have some far more devious or clever
1411.12,1415.28," depending on how you look at its solutions too. So for example, last E3, I was talking to a guy"
1415.92,1421.52, that was just leaving EA to work for. Let's just say a certain RPG maker in Canada.
1421.52,1429.92, And you basically revealed that one of the things that EA was researching as an answer is to
1430.8799999999999,1436.3999999999999, basically tell players in multiplayer games that you can wear sponsored product and in exchange
1436.3999999999999,1441.28," will give you some sort of in-game incentive. If you give money perhaps, maybe it's"
1441.36,1447.76," oh, there are some sort of in-game incentive. And the result is that when you're walking around"
1447.76,1451.44," every time you see this guy, he's wearing the McDonald's shirt or something. So not only are you driving"
1451.44,1454.96," past it in a million miles an hour, every time you talk to this dude or go"
1454.96,1458.8799999999999," quest with them or skate with them or frag with them, whatever you're doing, you're seeing"
1458.8799999999999,1464.24, his logo on his shirt. So those are like those guys who drive around in the car or the car
1464.24,1469.28," yeah, with the vinyl on top of their car with, yeah, it's basically like that or the people"
1469.28,1475.12," who get tattooed on their head and $1,000,000, the way this could be in any game. Yeah, that's"
1475.12,1478.72," like it was definitely looking at it. And when you look at it in those terms, you can imagine"
1478.72,1483.68, it working really well and say like NBA Jam online. Right. But it wouldn't work well in
1483.68,1488.6399999999999," World of Warcraft. Maybe it was, I don't want to be questioning with a guy in a McDonald's outfit."
1488.6399999999999,1492.72," Imagine it though and say auto assault or something, you know? Well auto assault maybe,"
1492.72,1496.96," but again, and see, soft, I'm not saying they have anything to do with it, but it's out there"
1497.04,1500.88, and I would be surprised if we don't start seeing that sort of thing. But it's got to be context
1500.88,1503.68," sensitive or it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna suck. Like it should be an average high"
1503.68,1508.32," little, little ren fair in Warcraft. That's about it. But yeah. In games like that though where there's"
1508.32,1513.44," a society and a culture, I think it's fine because you'll see some really, I mean, who's to say"
1513.44,1517.28, that the players aren't gonna just ostracize an exile those people. You want to see it back in the
1517.28,1523.2, box inside of Azeroth? Right. But those players can decide to to police that on their own against
1523.28,1527.52," the game, you know? I'm sure unless the company says hey, you cannot haze people for what they"
1527.52,1532.48," wear in this game. Otherwise they can be like, conswearing Jack and a box is not, you know?"
1532.48,1537.76, I would gank those. Did it? I'm sorry. Did you plan it side have ads for like Burger King?
1537.76,1542.96," You know, actually, they also had an ad for Doose Bigelow. But I remember that."
1542.96,1550.0," Oh my god. The animal. I was actually, since the game has gone totally free now,"
1550.96,1555.44, I actually played again recently to see where it's at. And there's ads for like under armor and
1555.44,1559.92," whatever, apparently in the future they still have that's brand them underwear. Wow. What if they like"
1559.92,1565.12," billboards or something? Yeah. It's like when you go to like the, like when you get revived or something"
1565.12,1571.36," you go and like equip up with some ammo and write above the ammo refilling is, the station is this big app."
1571.92,1574.48, You're a resurrection. Yeah. I guess it's exactly exactly.
1574.56,1581.68," You know, playing fear recently, you know, they have all the Coke machine or the soda machines in there."
1581.68,1588.4," But that's the thing. They're all generic, right? Yeah. They would be very easy to have them as a specific."
1588.4,1591.52, And those are the ones I wouldn't mind. They're all gave someone's channel one.
1594.72,1600.16, Does that make sense? No. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. It does. So we're agreed then.
1601.1200000000001,1606.96," In game ads good. But bad if. If in world of work, right? If there's another one."
1607.76,1611.68," Someone's eating a jumbo jack because I'm trying to, you know, kill some nulls and world of"
1611.68,1617.2," workcraft. That's going to suspend my disbelief, you know? What if you could just know for real."
1617.2,1622.3200000000002, It's the incentive that was like your your sword gets plus five whatever if you wear the j-bo
1624.4,1628.88, plus five of grease. That is debilitates.
1628.96,1632.16, It's moving on. Shall we? I think we killed this one.
1632.16,1639.5200000000002," Oil's j-bo sword. Oh, sorry. All right. Okay. Do we have anything else to talk about this week?"
1640.5600000000002,1644.5600000000002, I think we got under wraps. Do we have an under wraps? Anyone Ryan? Do you have any
1645.3600000000001,1648.0, any words of wisdom for our listeners out there?
1650.3200000000002,1656.5600000000002," And if you remember, if you can kill him, if you, if you, if you correctly guess the amount of words"
1656.6399999999999,1660.6399999999999," that Ryan has said this. No, note that was just one time. Nobody nobody. Nobody."
1660.6399999999999,1665.44," Nobody want to free copy of a boobie. So yeah, that's right. You guys all blew it out there."
1665.44,1670.1599999999999, I'm not sponsoring any more content. I'm not gonna say my heart. Ryan told us he'd give it to the
1670.1599999999999,1677.9199999999998," first person who wrote in. Very quickly just to keep us honest, what did we all play this weekend?"
1679.2,1685.12, Battle for middle area. Battle for middle or two. Red or distraught front. Nice. Are you liking it?
1685.84,1691.04," Yeah, long story like in it, but it's frustrating and fun. My turn's just largely if you're"
1691.04,1696.08," winning or losing. But, uh, I mean, that's not the reason for winning and frustrating. If you're"
1696.08,1700.6399999999999," losing, that's what it's all games. But I think it's even more so in a, in a very realistic sim,"
1700.6399999999999,1706.08," it's sort of game like that. I mean, if you're thinking shooter think more sim. So, uh, so forget it"
1706.08,1711.1999999999998," then. I'm not playing it. I mean, you have to make it a little bit. Maybe more, but not always,"
1711.28,1715.8400000000001," not always, uh, twitch skill. Sometimes thinking and understanding the way that the game works."
1715.8400000000001,1719.6000000000001," So it's not like, you know, a battle field in 1942. There's actually like, you know,"
1719.6000000000001,1724.32," got to slow down the pace. So that's a whole other thing. So like, I was, yeah, we'll take me forever."
1724.32,1729.1200000000001, Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Subject for our future. Yeah. Stay tuned. It'd be good one for next time.
1729.1200000000001,1733.28," Mr. Gladstone, you're gaming weekend. It was like an all-eyed ass weekend for me. Apparently I was playing"
1733.28,1738.56," the new Tomb Raider, which surprisingly doesn't suck. I'm really, I'm really happy that they're"
1738.56,1743.6, actually getting back to the roots on that one. And I also started playing commandos strike force.
1744.6399999999999,1751.2, Cool. That's it. That's it. Those are the two games that occupy my weekend. And it was all
1751.2,1755.6799999999998, battle for a middle-earth too for me too. And it was quite good. I was really happy.
1756.32,1761.12," It's a Ryan U and I have to play multiplayer. And I have to say, I never thought a game where"
1761.12,1766.24," Tom Bombadell was actually a unit in the game. What actually would be good. And then not only is it,"
1766.32,1771.2," is it good, but that unit is good. Have you used Tom Bombadell yet? I haven't."
1771.2,1780.4," Cool. I'll give you Tom Bombadell. Polarized by Bombadell. Okay. On that note, we are out. We'll see you next week."
1780.4,1782.16, Thanks for listening.
