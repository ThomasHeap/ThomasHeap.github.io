0.0,10.48," Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. It is September 50,07. It's the second day of school for a bunch of"
10.48,18.0, young little kids out there for us. Eight adults were back at work. God dammit and we're here to
18.0,24.0, podcast for you because we love you. I have no idea school was back in the last one.
24.0,27.6," Really? Well, I got a kid. She just started eighth grade."
27.6,33.36," Baby, she aimed me to a clock and said, Dad, I had the worst day ever. That's how she started"
33.36,38.8," eighth grade. Oh, and I said, hey, it's eighth grade. It's by far not your worst day ever."
38.8,42.8, It's going to get so much worse. It's how he told her. Of course not.
42.8,55.92," So yeah, we're here. We have our extra special fourth chair today. Robert Ashley is back."
56.72,62.4," Back in the hot seat. Hi. Actually, that's not very hard. Well, the fifth chair. Yeah,"
62.4,68.96," yeah, it's not hard though. It's pretty comfy. Is it pleasant in here today? Nice chairs."
69.83999999999999,76.96," Thank you. Robert, everybody else say hi. Is it Ryan Scott?"
79.36,86.0," I'm sorry. I had to introduce myself. You do like a Ryan. You're like, you're on that shit."
86.0,89.03999999999999, You're on point like a Vulcan's ear. Hi. This is Sean Elliott.
90.47999999999999,96.47999999999999," Hi, this is Sean Deloy. Hi. Hi, this is Jeffrey. Hi, everyone. So we've got a few things on our"
96.48,102.0, little agenda here today. I'm going to do a little last last last. Maybe the last time we're going to
102.0,107.28, talk about Bosch. We don't want to wear out the games. Welcome here. We got a few gameplay things we
107.28,113.12, wanted to talk about. We're going to tie that into a really interesting blog post that's
113.12,121.44, Sean Johnson of is he actually at for access? He's at Maxis now. He's at Maxis now. Right. He was at
121.44,128.8," for access. He's defected. He's working on the sport. Oh, right. Maxis. I use this. Play on the six"
128.8,138.4, axis. I knew this. But I lost my train to thought with that. We're going to talk about other stuff.
138.4,143.76, Do you. Sean Elliott downloaded and Mr. Ashley here downloaded opposing forces.
143.76,147.76," No, my front. Bobby, you know, I actually didn't. Oh, you didn't. You were spoke everyone on"
147.84,152.72," stack. Oh, you had the same troubles me? No, I didn't even try to download. I haven't. This is the"
152.72,156.95999999999998," first thing I've ever heard. I'm like, oh, oh, oh, what the hell are you doing here?"
156.95999999999998,161.44, I'm sure. I'll take off that head. Here's what Bobby does here two weeks ago.
162.79999999999998,167.04," Well, when he was last on our podcast, we were talking about Hucksters. It came out of, you know,"
167.04,172.64, some of his tales from travels to various places in Europe and also throughout the world.
172.79999999999998,177.27999999999997," Shanghai. Yeah, some swelters. He ran into. Yeah. That's a hot term. By the way,"
177.27999999999997,182.64," swelish. Swelers. Is that vile and some wine? It's just, I don't know. It's I need to I need to"
182.64,187.2," introduce it like, Wajai and I've been seeing people use Wajai. I don't claim to have been in the"
187.2,192.79999999999998," term, but I definitely claim to being very interested in spreading its use. And I've seen it appear"
192.79999999999998,197.6," in a stock and Wajai. But anyway, back to the point, oh, during the talk of the Hucksters,"
197.68,203.35999999999999," Robert and I were both saying how on the train from, you know, where we live in Berkeley to San Francisco,"
203.35999999999999,207.35999999999999," we often run into this woman who says, you know, she's got this or that she needs,"
207.35999999999999,213.04," yeah, it's amount of dollars for medication. Well, after we took the headsets off and left"
213.04,218.72," and got on the train, who opens the door at whatever, in 19th street Oakland style boy,"
218.72,223.6," right on our cart comes right in, but her, and it was like, that was just some red."
223.6,227.44, Robert was just so confused. He was like looking around for the hidden camera and some shit.
227.44,231.68, Because that was the only the second time that that's ever happened to me. But the amazing thing
231.68,236.16," was the person who did give money, gave like that look to everyone else in the car, like,"
236.16,242.24," you people are animals. And I wanted to be like, don't you know, you've been fooled."
243.04,247.2, I can't stand her. Yeah. I feel bad. I hope she doesn't listen to our podcast.
248.4,255.12," What do you think the odds are? Oh, pretty good. Yeah. So you're not getting a dime out of me, lady."
255.76,260.56," That was an important follow up. Well, thanks. That was really what he's here. Just for that."
260.56,263.76, Just for that. And you didn't even need to be here for.
263.76,269.92, Fuck out. Just here for moral support. Yes. That's cool. We need to be like that.
269.92,274.24, We're in secure here. I'll just share you on. Awesome.
275.28000000000003,279.92," So, and then there was some other item that I forget. We're going to talk about."
279.92,283.2," I don't know. We've got random stuff. I like we said it's a,"
283.92,287.36, we're shipping a magazine. So we didn't have much time to prepare. But yeah. So this is the
287.36,290.4," notorious ship week that happens here every, every month."
291.36,294.88," Well, we got that item of controversy. We might get to you. We'll just have to leave it at that"
294.88,297.68, and see if we get there without teasing any further.
297.68,300.71999999999997," Items of contra. And heroes of the web. Let's,"
300.71999999999997,304.48, fucking. Let's just start off with the hero. It's stuff this. All right.
304.48,308.32, All right. Where's the heroes? It's a queue. The heroes of the web theme. I don't even
308.32,312.8, practice as I like right before I came into here. I pasted it. I'm sorry. Now it seems like
313.28,317.44, here's the web's range is very finite and it always has to do well. Just another
317.44,322.32," story and characters. No, this one's not. But like, well, last week's was people"
323.12,327.44, debating whether or not one of the races of aliens and Mass Effect can have intercourse
327.44,335.59999999999997, or humans. So this week on bungee.net forums. We have the thread. It's Master Chief of
335.68,345.28000000000003, Virgin. So I'm going to serious thread. Do I have to ask that? It is. There are people in there
345.28000000000003,350.56, that are upset. This is supposed to so immature. I can't believe it. Which is kind of funny too.
350.56,354.40000000000003," It's like, why would you respond that way? You're so immature. Don't ask me that. Gosh,"
354.40000000000003,359.28000000000003," I think about that all day, but I wouldn't post it on the internet. Anyway, his sex life is private."
360.23999999999995,365.91999999999996, So he's got it first. He was taken when he was freaking out. I'm pretty sure
365.91999999999996,371.35999999999996, in April didn't get laid. When he was augmented and crap his sexual organs were rendered
371.35999999999996,377.11999999999995, inactive. Either that or they decreased to the amount of hormones produced. It was to make sure
377.11999999999995,382.0," the Master Chief kept his mind on the business at hand. So yes, he's a virgin."
383.44,387.2," That guy's pretty happy. That was all covered in one of Halo 2's key cutscenes, I believe."
387.84,396.4, Then we have a response. He and Cortana did it in the Pelican in the cockpit. That was part.
397.03999999999996,401.36," And after that, Master Chief did it so hard that she turned into a computer program."
404.4,408.48, Because of an extreme malfunction in the Pelican's cockpit.
408.48,413.52," And Master Chief armor sitting there causing extreme chemical reaction,"
413.52,419.28, which turned Cortana in Captain Keys found out. And so then that she was turned into a
419.28,424.47999999999996, cop program. She never became pregnant in Captain Keys kept in secret from everyone else in
424.47999999999996,432.15999999999997, UNSC. How does that catch got to be? How can a person has his biggest master Chief be a virgin?
432.56,435.12, Holy head out of your ass. Okay.
436.79999999999995,439.52, Then we have to start into fan fiction. Then we have to get into the whole.
440.47999999999996,445.91999999999996," And as to the part where he's been on active duty since he was six, he has to have been on leave"
445.91999999999996,451.68," at least once. But in my opinion, you can't lose your virginity to a horror. So whichever way you're"
451.68,460.79999999999995, a opinion lies. Wow. Wow. Oh. You can't lose your virginity to a horror. Why did
460.79999999999995,467.03999999999996," us doesn't count? I begged a differ. Marvelous thing. Well in that case, I'm still a virgin."
470.4,478.64," If you'd like to deflower Robert. So, oh, this goes on. No, I mean, it's going to be bad. Okay, so"
479.28,486.08," that helps. Someone else wants to know. Even if, wait, even if he was, he's so brave."
486.64,493.91999999999996, It's bland. Can you imagine how big his wing dang dutel is? It's probably 15 inches.
494.71999999999997,497.59999999999997," But someone really type wing dang dutel? Yeah, I think that's shit."
497.6,501.04," So when you're making this up, I want to see the paper. Here's luck, dude."
501.04,508.0," Hello, I'm a wing dang dutel. Oh. Okay. Unbelievable. So then the next response is,"
509.04,514.16, why would anyone want one that big? Not to make sure that biological alterations in
514.16,519.0400000000001, enhanced growth rates probably stunting him in that area. So stopping him a turn about size.
519.0400000000001,520.8000000000001, Since that is double the average humans.
521.76,532.4799999999999, Then average is 6 to 7 inches in and don't slot you fucking at me. Look it up and dig yourself out of the hole.
532.4799999999999,538.0," You car reality. The thing that they don't realize. He and he larger than 8 inches, Robert is wasted."
538.0,541.8399999999999," Anyway, since that is as far as you can go inside of your par. Okay."
545.04,548.0," Not done, dude. You're not the boss."
548.08,549.36, That's it.
550.16,555.76," Wait, people that realize that the master chief's been augmented because the entire purpose of the"
555.76,561.52," halo is to be receptacle for master chief's massive, massive wing dang dutel."
563.52,568.24, It's a giant. It looks like a giant. I don't want to say it. Yeah. Yeah.
568.24,572.08," Well, not a giant like whatever bad means like a whatever those in your"
572.08,577.84," uterine device like a contraceptive. Anyway, I don't know."
577.84,583.36," Yeah, official bungee forums. That is incredible. Then the final one. The final one brings back some"
583.36,589.44, sense of sense to it all and just says you actually think that MC had sex on the spare time.
589.44,594.08," Seriously, he had far better things to worry about like completing missions to raise much needed"
594.08,598.4000000000001, morale. Sex is probably the last thing on the mind of the savior of this earth.
598.72,605.92," That's amazing. That and this week, you know, a love gross man has a three-page story and time"
605.92,611.68, magazine about halo three and it's all about how it's representing like the the grown-up art form
611.68,615.4399999999999," of the whole game. Yeah, there's one in entertainment. Yeah, basically too. So yeah,"
615.4399999999999,620.24," you can read it. Cover a wire, too. That's some good PR. Did they got going on the other way?"
621.4399999999999,626.48, Everything. But they use that. Yeah. That's the model as like his teacher. Yeah.
626.5600000000001,629.28, Halo. I have to read this. I have to read this. Yeah. I have to read this.
629.28,632.88," Yeah. It's an interesting case for me, but I can pick up a couple of things. I was going to"
632.88,636.64," write it off to top of my head. The film where like he was just trying to, he wanted to tell, you"
636.64,641.28," know, the story of how games were becoming this acceptable thing for adults who aren't freaks to"
641.28,645.28," do, but the only thing he could use was Halo three because it's the only thing that he could get three"
645.28,654.0, pages in time magazine to go. Yeah. So yeah. Unstandable. Yeah. So we're not that. I don't know
654.0,659.6," how to where to go after that thread. Well, Sean slash podcast. That's a 10 years later. Here's"
659.6,666.24, like a generic transition from that. But on the front of more a wider audience playing games these
666.24,671.12," days. Yeah. And that shaping the way that the games themselves are made. All right. Jeff, you"
671.12,676.0, think it just participate in our spoiler free zone by our chocolate. I did not. So we're going to
676.0,680.24, come back to it briefly. This time in the context of people that think the game is far too easy
680.4,684.5600000000001, in that it sucks because of that reactionaries. I think it's saying that the whole game sucks
684.5600000000001,693.2, because it's too easy. This is a pitted by one up dot com screen name pen 15. So I'll just read quickly
693.2,699.92," from this post. All right. Let me get the voice for this guy. I just want to find it. Um, no. So he just says"
700.88,707.36," that at the moment, I have a dead 360 and hope to play by our shank after Halo three since"
707.36,714.48, my constant come on dude. Why did I paste that? Okay. Okay. Game spot. The game spot review pointed
714.48,718.4, out that the game basically can be beaten by anyone since there's no punishment for being killed.
718.4,721.44," Essentially, when you're killed, everything you've done in the world remains the same,"
721.44,726.5600000000001," including the damage enemies take. Ratchet and Clank had a similar system of minimal punishment,"
726.5600000000001,732.16, but enemies still remain with their full health. Also items like health respond to give you a better
732.16,736.4, chance to win by our shotgun cover went one step further made a possible for players of any
736.48,741.76, skill to win and essentially making the difficulty choice pointless. This was a deal breaker for me.
741.76,746.0, The game has no challenge that why am I playing? Am I the only one that plays games for challenge?
746.64,751.68, Some play for story. Some play for the specific genre and some play for fun. Why?
751.68,757.04, I am personally going to wait for the Bioshot crew to release a patch to remove the feature.
757.04,761.28, But most likely not happens since I doubt the demand for it will be very strong since gamers
761.36,765.92," nowadays don't mind that they're very easy. God of War. Yeah, I'm not liking his day."
765.92,771.28, So I'll probably wait so I could pick it up for 20 bucks. So two questions. Am I insane for not liking
771.28,775.8399999999999, a game that guarantees to be beaten? Yes. It does not present a challenge to the player.
775.8399999999999,779.8399999999999," Also, what do you look for when playing a game? Story, genre, gameplay, challenge?"
780.64,785.68," Fun. It's a fun. Why would it read like a personal ad? Yeah. By the fact the whole, by the"
785.68,790.64," shock holes, the whole thing is that's kind of tailored to your own skill level. Like in terms,"
790.64,795.04, even with all the flashing items you can turn on and off and all the stuff. So I don't know what's
795.04,799.52," preventing anyone. It's just a flat lie. Like you'll just run that. Yeah, I'm the size that."
799.52,803.52, Right. You'll do anything. I don't know what's preventing him from uploading. Right. The endless
804.4,815.5999999999999, Vita Chamevita Chamevita. Rhymes with Pita. The endless Vita Chamevita. It eventually will not work.
815.68,820.0799999999999," For you. You like you said, you'll just run out of shit. You'll be out of everything. I mean,"
820.0799999999999,824.2399999999999," you'll be having a choice at some point. But to, yeah, if you, you're going to basically,"
824.2399999999999,829.04," you say you run out of all ammo, you're going to have an enraged big daddy that you're trying to"
829.04,833.04," finish off, although when you, when you respond to the chamber, he's no longer aggressive,"
833.04,837.04," but you're basically going up hitting with your wrench once, getting killed, coming back,"
837.04,842.24, hitting with your wrench again and doing this over and over again about 20 times. It sounds a lot more
842.5600000000001,847.12," challenging. Technically, you could do that. He thinks that that is how he would play it. But how is that"
847.12,852.0," cheating? How does that make the game easy? We're, of course, interested in this guy's larger"
852.0,856.08," case, but just to back up one second, the other thing that's funny about this particular post is"
856.08,861.04, at the guy is going on what he read somewhere. Right. Right. He's not even playing. But just notice
861.04,864.8," that he's decided, oh, this isn't the game for me. It's not a challenge. Well, like, dude,"
865.6800000000001,868.96," you're even in the wrong, like, why even settle for video games? I mean, you can't for one,"
868.96,873.6800000000001," go back to the old shit, play Castlevania, play those games that were made to take your money."
873.6800000000001,879.2," And so we're hard because they wanted your quarters. Or go to like those little shops in the mall,"
879.2,883.36," read it. You can get like a little wood puzzle with a ball bearing in it, and you've got to roll it"
883.36,888.72," through some impossibly convolutor. Just get like, go buy the Gordian knot and just tie that, you know?"
888.72,893.6," I mean, I just don't understand what this guy and the other post I read, like on"
893.6,898.88," card of three, or like if there's a feature you don't like that you feel is like a cheat to other"
898.88,903.6800000000001," gamers, like the Vita Chambers, then don't fucking use it. Yeah, just read it. You know, you can just"
903.6800000000001,908.16," I mean, yeah, when you die, you'll be in the chamber, but then just do a reload from your save point."
908.16,912.72," If you think it's cheating to just respond with the things having the same event. If you wanted,"
912.72,916.64," you could quick save every time you start what you consider to be a new level, and then just agree"
916.64,921.76," with yourself to reload every time you die to that point. Exactly. I think that a few times, like any time"
921.84,926.16," I got into a big daddy battle, or mostly big daddy battles, or the things that trip me up,"
926.16,930.8," where like I just felt like I could have done that way better. Even though I won, I would sometimes"
930.8,936.4," just reload just to like, put the satisfaction of doing that. Yeah, I find myself reloading a lot"
936.4,945.04," just because of ammo and the eave distribution. Like on my beat something, but I'll, but I'll think"
945.04,949.28, I just could have been so much more efficient about that. I'll think of a way I could have
950.24,955.52," beat the big daddy in using the environment in a smarter way rather than using all my own stuff,"
955.52,960.64," like setting up the turrets or when hacking the turrets, you know, things like that. I just don't"
961.1999999999999,970.16," like it's sort of mind bogging to me that that rational put in so many choices for the gamer,"
970.16,974.72," that, you know, they basically said like, we want everybody to be able to play this. Doesn't matter"
974.8000000000001,980.0," how casual or hard core you are. To me, like I don't see how you can see that, does anything,"
980.0,984.8000000000001," but like a totally good thing. If you're so hardcore that the easy stuff's bothering you, just ignore"
984.8000000000001,989.12," it. Yeah, and going back to what you're saying about efficiency, like I think the whole point of"
989.12,994.08," the way the game is designed isn't that traditional, like, you know, get through the game without"
994.08,999.0400000000001," getting killed, idea, it's more like get through the game efficiently so that you have all the fun"
999.12,1005.52," stuff to you. Yeah. Like that's your incentive to play well is to keep all your fun stuff and keep,"
1005.52,1009.8399999999999," you know, the options open so you can do the things you want to do. You wouldn't want to just go around,"
1009.8399999999999,1015.04," like wasting everyone and getting killed all the time would just be stupid. Right, I don't understand"
1015.04,1020.9599999999999, the argument that it's broken because of that. Yeah. They could go through the game with just your wrench.
1020.9599999999999,1024.72," I mean, yeah, you could. If you're just doing your challenge,"
1025.44,1029.52," well, that gives you, it actually is pretty viable. It gives you some plasmids and genetown"
1029.52,1033.2," specifically for going through the whole game with your wrench. I mean, coming from the point of view,"
1033.2,1037.3600000000001," actually an option coming from the point of view of a console gamer to me, it's always felt"
1037.3600000000001,1041.92," similar like with PC games, you could just save before every little fight. Yeah, there's a, there's"
1041.92,1046.56, like that way. If you have a six and you can save every second and there's plenty of gamers who feel that
1046.56,1053.04," that is cheating, right? I've rather the old, you know, quick save versus checkpoint. Yeah, I mean,"
1053.12,1058.24, save nowadays. God forbid we go back to like limited continues or like the resident evil typewriter
1058.24,1064.24," ribbon system. Yeah. Like that way. We don't need that. Those isn't it. We've said this before,"
1064.24,1070.48," but those are just absolutely mind boggling to deal with when you're an adult. And yeah,"
1070.48,1073.68," you know, when you're, you're girlfriend or your wife or someone that comes home and you're like,"
1073.68,1078.24," I need to turn this off. Like, I have some other stuff to deal and it's like, oh, wait, let me"
1078.24,1083.04," find a save point. I remember the last time I did that was with Namco's, uh, what was it Nina?"
1083.04,1086.88, It was the action third person action game with Nina for my degree. You've set by degrees.
1087.6,1091.76," And you had to find, and not only that, it wasn't that you had to get to the same point, but they"
1091.76,1096.56, were hidden. And it was a mini game to find where they were at by listening for the sound and
1096.56,1101.04," locating them. So I was like, okay, and let me just find a save point. And I'm looking, I'm looking,"
1101.04,1105.2," and I'm like, shit, I'm going to die before I find this damn thing. I eventually I found a"
1105.2,1108.72," but of course, yeah, I was like 30 minutes of work. And then that also means whenever you die,"
1108.72,1114.64, you have to go lose 30 minutes of work. But yeah. And that shit doesn't fly like when you have a kid or
1114.64,1120.0800000000002," whatever. That's why the ultimate thing is like the DS because you just, you know, drop it shut."
1120.0800000000002,1125.44, Close it like plan done. It doesn't interrupt your life. Mm-hmm. So yeah.
1126.56,1131.92," The way exhausted by a shot for forever now. I am, I'm still, I'm still up in it. I, I'm definitely"
1131.92,1136.3200000000002," like in the game a lot. One thing that we didn't bitch out because, you know, in the last time we spoke about,"
1136.3200000000002,1140.88," we wanted to talk about some of the broader, you know, and more interesting aspects of the game. But the"
1140.88,1147.2," the mini game thing is annoying to me. Yeah. But again, there is an option. I didn't have to do it."
1147.2,1153.04," I mean, because I used auto hacks and, you know, I was able to at least like make the process less"
1153.04,1158.5600000000002, painful by the types of gene tonics and stuff that I used. But that was like annoying to me because
1158.6399999999999,1163.84, it was like pausing the game to go play some pop cap game every however long. So I was supposed to be
1163.84,1168.3999999999999," all tense. I'm like, I need to hurry up hack this because I need some help and there's a big daddy chasing me."
1168.3999999999999,1172.6399999999999," It's like, go chill over there dude. I'm going to load off. We'll go browse pop cap and play."
1172.6399999999999,1179.6," What's that firecracker game? You light up the fuses? I think about it. Yeah, rocket"
1179.6,1182.8799999999999, main. I think it's more awesome. It's more of it. It's welcome for me about halfway through.
1182.8799999999999,1187.12," And then like I said, low and I'm all, I was just like taking my shotgun to everything. It's like,"
1187.12,1190.8, I could hack this and have a shoot that I think over there. I could just get it out of the way.
1190.8,1195.36, Right. That's why I stopped hacking later on if I didn't have Insta Hacks because I just didn't
1195.36,1200.8799999999999, want to bother with that. It's kind of weird. That's always a difficult element in any game to
1200.8799999999999,1205.12, throw in something without that's basically it's going to amount to a mini game. You want some
1205.12,1209.76," other lock mode of interactive. Yeah, lock picking, I think, is a good example of something that worked"
1209.76,1215.76," well with an analog stick because it's all just, um, it's another form of feedback and it just clicks"
1215.76,1222.24," into place. And then in a Splinter's Arcade Theory in the co-op, um, they had one where you're basically,"
1222.24,1227.04, it's like hot wiring a car almost and you're just connecting certain wires on a bomb or something.
1227.04,1230.72," And it just worked because you moved the sticks together and you kind of felt where they were like,"
1231.52,1235.28," you know, vibrating in response. And it happened really quickly. But it was like, it was that was"
1235.28,1238.96," that was the way it was supposed to be. It was so quick that you didn't feel like, like you said,"
1238.96,1241.68, were you're hitting pause and you're going to go play a pop. I'm going to come back into the
1241.68,1245.44," action. Once they're probably weren't three cars right next to each other, the hot wire in a row."
1245.44,1248.48, Like sometimes there's three vending machines right there. Yeah. Okay. I got to get this one.
1248.48,1253.68," Thanks. Thanks. Next. Again, you can just blow them up or skip them. I feel kind of like"
1254.0800000000002,1258.3200000000002," conflicted about them because they did get annoying. But the same time, I sort of enjoyed the fact"
1258.3200000000002,1263.52," that it was like your little hideaway from the from the action from the ginger, where you're like"
1263.52,1268.4," getting your possibly on the verge of getting killed, but then you jump up and hack a camera or something."
1268.4,1273.28," And all of a sudden it's like, oh, it's all good. But it's like full of time. So I mean, without the right"
1273.36,1278.72," stuff, I mean, when they were going really quick, or if it was like a hard, it was gauged as a hard hack."
1279.36,1283.68, Yeah. That was for you. You get an overload and then you have to help. I do what you had unlocked some
1283.68,1289.44," sort of item that would just make hacking, you know, hit X to hack always. Like, you know, yeah, I figured"
1289.44,1293.92," there would be a past mid or something. Yeah, I don't know how to hack, but then we're happened. Yeah."
1293.92,1298.72," Maybe there is one hidden deep in the same thing like the gale, the lock changing in oblivion,"
1299.68,1304.24," I made a. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That was one. I actually just put a hack in. I just"
1304.24,1308.72," hacked myself the ability to, so I didn't have to make the hack. The hack. That one, that one was problematic"
1308.72,1313.44," for me because I never quite figured out what was going on. Like, I was supposed to be listening for"
1313.44,1318.0," something maybe. Yeah. I'm just like, uh, I'm not entirely sure. Yeah, that's the most annoying."
1318.0,1322.24," When you're like, I really don't know. I'm just like going through here at dumb lock and brute force and"
1323.3600000000001,1328.08, not fun. I can't remember what the system that was. I remember I used to like bring the
1328.08,1331.52, picks all the time because I didn't get it. But then I finally wanted to be somehow.
1332.56,1336.1599999999999, That had at least had an auto pick lock button right in the middle of the screen. Yeah.
1336.1599999999999,1341.12," I haven't tried out of my mind for a role of die, but I think it rolled the diary badly."
1341.76,1345.84, I think that it would have been one thing I read on quarter three was somebody was suggesting
1345.84,1351.4399999999998," that with the with the with the respawning. I mean, the the vital chambers and the fact that the"
1352.4,1361.1200000000001, enemies weren't that their health was not replenishing when you die. I felt that might have been
1361.1200000000001,1365.28," at least a good option. You know, you talked about have there's options to turn things on and off"
1365.28,1369.52, throughout bio shock. I thought that would have been a good option. If you could have set the difficulty
1369.52,1375.3600000000001," so that when you when you die, when you respond at a vital chamber, all the monsters go back up to 100"
1375.3600000000001,1379.76, percent health. Now I got to try hard mode because I'm wondering what it does to maybe alleviate
1380.24,1385.2," that it doesn't sound like nothing. It doesn't. Maybe that. I don't think so as promised,"
1385.2,1391.52, sort of Johnson blocked eight things that he if what were the eight things that he
1391.52,1398.32, to test about game design or just a bad game choice. And they tying directly with what we're talking
1398.32,1404.08, about here. The first one is has the hard core game conventions and I don't know how much of this
1404.08,1409.12," I should read, but so he says one of the most common pitfalls for a designer is to fear that the"
1409.12,1413.1999999999998, game is not hard enough. This fear often leads to hardcore game conventions like restrictive
1413.1999999999998,1417.84, safe systems and unlockable content that only put roadblocks in the way the mainstream gamer
1417.84,1421.84, is just looking to have a good time. If you feel your game needs a tension of restrictive
1421.84,1426.3999999999999," safe system, go ahead and implement it, but only as a feature of a higher difficulty level. Right."
1426.3999999999999,1430.7199999999998," So exactly what we're saying here, then he points to the difference between trauma center on DS"
1430.7199999999998,1437.4399999999998, and elite beat agents and saying that how elite beat agents is like the more is the better selling
1437.44,1442.0800000000002, game and also just more loved game and for that reason that it has an easy mode that's not
1442.72,1446.64," punishing where trauma center on DS once you get four different people. Yeah, that's totally true."
1446.64,1450.96," There is a whole level where I just like screw this game. Yeah, trauma center. Right. I mean,"
1450.96,1455.04," Bob Chuck could they could put in like an iron man mode, right? Well, all the fighter chambers are"
1455.04,1462.4, locked from just gone or something. I don't know. Yep. So then the second one is a repetitive
1462.4,1468.0800000000002, interface task. And so he says he's currently playing old school dungeon crawler. Is that a trainer
1468.0800000000002,1474.5600000000002, e-train? I think it's a train. A train Odyssey on DS enough so that I can't help daydream about
1474.5600000000002,1478.96," how much fun it would be to make the barts tail or legacy the ancients for DS. Unfortunately,"
1478.96,1483.0400000000002, the game's interface does a terrible job enabling the player to skip over needlessly repetitive
1483.0400000000002,1487.6000000000001," tasks. Want to sell your loot? You have to click on every single hair tail in your inventory,"
1487.6000000000001,1491.6000000000001," not once, but twice for confirmation. After a long excursion, this can lead to about 100"
1491.6799999999998,1495.1999999999998," presses of the A button when you get back to town. A simple sell-all,"
1495.1999999999998,1500.9599999999998," vitamin X would have been an invaluable time saver. So we get the whole level convention. It is,"
1500.9599999999998,1504.8799999999999," but I mean, now and then you run into it a lot. I mean, it's a little bit of a stoppin. It's a"
1504.8799999999999,1509.6799999999998," thing too. I mean, I really think the larger, I mean, a payment to brought brush. I really think that"
1509.6799999999998,1515.84," Japan is characterized by these things. You know, the next example we has is another"
1516.1599999999999,1523.04," for this case. Well, you know, Odyssey is a Japanese developed game. And another example"
1523.04,1527.4399999999998," inside of that is the dialogue. You know, when you're playing a Japanese RPG, and it's like,"
1527.4399999999998,1531.76," date date date date date. You can't, it's like you can speed it up eventually. They had the breakthrough"
1531.76,1535.6799999999998," with their like, maybe some people can read faster than others. But they still haven't had the"
1535.6799999999998,1538.9599999999998," breakthrough. We're like, we write pieces of shit dialogue and there's going to be people that"
1538.9599999999998,1544.0," don't want to read a period. They don't have that option still. Why do you hate Japan, Sean?"
1544.08,1548.64," I like Japan. It's a great place. But I think, man, their game sucks. No, I think they made me."
1548.64,1553.76," I mean, I'm totally there with you. I mean, every country's studios make not every country's,"
1553.76,1557.68," but you know, the major game development studios in various countries, regardless of country"
1557.68,1563.44," make good games and bad games. But there are certain things, particularly about Japanese game"
1563.44,1568.0, design that have become increasingly annoying to me. I think as I've become older and have
1568.08,1575.84," less time to or have more options. I mean, it all goes back to if, if this Japanese RPG was the"
1575.84,1580.16, one game I got for the next three months or maybe all of that month. I don't care how slow the dialogue
1580.16,1584.4, is. I don't care how long it takes. How many times I have to repeat the same button presses and
1584.4,1590.0, menus. I don't care about how far the save points are. I've got all data play and I'm going to
1590.0,1592.96," get my money's worth that of that game. They can, they can't remember about me. But now I'm like,"
1592.96,1597.44," I'm sitting on five different games. It's like, hey, I should be playing the hell gate beta. I want"
1597.52,1600.3200000000002," to play a button. I want to play this. You know, I have all these things. It's like,"
1600.96,1604.4," well, if a game is just going to be sitting there wasting my time with this kind of thing, it becomes"
1604.4,1609.92," more annoying to me. I also think like I always, you know, to a certain extent associate Japanese"
1609.92,1614.72," game design with being more about like controlling what it is the players doing, you know,"
1614.72,1621.2," sending you through the tube and having a very, uh, past game experience where the new exactly"
1621.2,1625.2," with the players going to be doing here, here, here, here, here, where as American game design,"
1625.28,1629.92," these days tends to be more open and like by a shock or grant theft auto, that's because we believe"
1629.92,1636.24," and freedom here. But I mean, you know, like half-life's a really, you know, down the tube"
1636.24,1642.96," experience, but, you know, that's a good one. I'm not opposed to being controlled to a certain extent,"
1644.0,1649.92," but I do think there are cultural, you know, differences in game design and what people like to play."
1649.92,1654.32," And Japanese games are definitely more punishing sometimes, you know, but I like that. I'm kind of a"
1654.3999999999999,1659.12," massacist. Like I like to play racing games and take the same corners like 50,000 times."
1659.12,1664.3999999999999," And it's difficult to say, oh, like Japanese games or, you know, North American games or European"
1664.3999999999999,1669.9199999999998," games or whatever, because there's so much variety. Like I said, like when I think of, I'm not thinking"
1669.9199999999998,1675.12," of like Nintendo first party games. I'm not thinking of to some extent, even Kojima's games. I mean,"
1675.12,1679.4399999999998," they, he does make weird decisions, design choices, you know, that, that seem at least weird,"
1679.52,1686.72," about contrast with Western things. But I'm thinking more of the, the shovel where it comes out,"
1686.72,1690.56," you know, because that's the thing. When most people talk about Japanese games that you think"
1690.56,1695.52," of the, in your head, you're like, well, let's say talking about devil-made cry, you know,"
1695.52,1701.68," metal gear, solid series, and, you know, final fantasy and stuff. But instead, thinking of the"
1701.68,1706.16," stuff that feels like the last half of EGIM's review section every month, you're like, what the hell is that?"
1706.64,1710.96," The little anime character games. Yeah, like all that kind of shit. You know, like, I was all"
1710.96,1715.6000000000001, like a like to me. Right. In the same way that they look in our review section and they see a
1715.6000000000001,1722.16," bunch of grids and tanks and, oh, great. They got that game again. That's, well, that's"
1722.16,1728.0," different. Yeah. No, it's, no, but that's a big stand. Yeah. I mean, you always have to"
1728.0,1732.96," specify because it, you know, we, we don't want people to think that this all there is on PC."
1732.96,1737.3600000000001," Then it, then what happens is one of those games actually is really good. Then that's its own"
1737.3600000000001,1740.96," challenge of saying, like, no, forget everything you assume about this kind of game in the same way that"
1740.96,1746.56," Robert, if you end up loving, when you have rad games where you touch little girls that come from Japan,"
1746.56,1750.08, and you have to explain to us why this one was better than the other. I actually have the most
1750.08,1754.56," extensive collection of the types of games, including I've been shot by nine out of the couple through"
1754.56,1760.4," a parole officer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like we've reviewed the same, and I like war games,"
1760.4,1764.16," but I feel like we've reviewed the same one for the last five years in a row. You know,"
1764.16,1768.72," it's always like, you know, road to Normandy or whatever. The name is always like, didn't we just do that?"
1770.5600000000002,1775.44," Last time it's been like the really heroic. I've been like, I was just talking to Sean outside because"
1775.44,1782.72," he's reading a reading a book about Stalin grad and about, you know, the brutal tactics used by"
1782.72,1786.5600000000002, Russians and Germans against each other and talking about like what it would be like if someone
1786.56,1792.6399999999999," really made a war game where there was no heroism, no like, you know, triumphant music, but just like"
1792.6399999999999,1798.6399999999999," disgusting murderous war. Like a rash amount, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
1799.6,1806.0, I came to that conclusion after I told him about the Russian trick of teaching dogs to fetch meat
1806.0,1809.76," from the bottom of a tank, and then after they had learned that trick, then strapping them with"
1809.76,1815.76," an explosive belt and a stick that jutted up far enough so that when they ran, when they saw"
1815.84,1820.32, a German tank then right underneath it and the stick would get pushed back and I'd write that as
1820.32,1825.76," evil. Yeah. War's not right. But if they did that in the Call of Duty game, it'd be all."
1834.96,1842.4, He's thinking about metal vodka. Or it is so bad. He's definitely like that. I was just stuck.
1842.48,1846.64," Yeah. I feel like I'm playing Mill of Honor Airborne now because it's the same side of thing. You're like,"
1846.64,1851.2800000000002," okay, this is supposed to be intense. You know, crazy action. And it's like, what's up with the strings?"
1851.2800000000002,1856.8000000000002," You know, like maybe on the credits role. Been enough bad movies now that do that. Yeah."
1856.8000000000002,1860.4," But it always, there was like a big point in that too. It's on the box like, you know, sweeping"
1860.4,1866.0," orchestral score by some, some such symphony, you know, who did it? It was all written down."
1866.0,1870.4," You fucked it up for everybody. He started tune. Wait, you put the Adagio for strings in"
1870.4,1875.2, that. Platoon. So you get this wonderful sad violin music going over.
1875.2,1882.16," Adagio, I prefer the the Apocalypse now of Wagner. Uh-huh. Just total evil. That day at least,"
1882.16,1887.68," like, justify though that it was, I mean, it was the helicopter crews were playing it. Yeah. Right."
1887.68,1892.0800000000002," But it was also just way more, way more brutal. They should just get"
1892.0800000000002,1896.88," some beat metal in there, green. That's yeah. I like it. So it would horrify parents even more,"
1896.88,1900.88," you know, they'd go into their kids room and they're like killing stuff and bodies are flying."
1900.88,1905.7600000000002," You know, the music's just like the heavy Metallica. My kid is going to the devil."
1907.3600000000001,1910.5600000000002," That's, I mean, that's what people are definitely listening to and tanks these days."
1910.5600000000002,1914.88, Let the bodies hit the floor. Let the bodies hit the floor. You watched that same
1914.88,1922.64, music and PR special or whatever. Yeah. I don't know how we got to say that. I don't know.
1922.8000000000002,1928.16," We get, uh, oh, we're talking about some of Johnson's. Yeah. So we're able to sell 100 things in one button."
1928.16,1933.0400000000002," Right. So he's got, you know, sell all of those. That's right."
1933.0400000000002,1935.44, I'll point the six more points on there that I haven't. Wow.
1935.44,1939.44," There's a two more. I'll let you see. No, no, no, no, no. You read another one. You want another one?"
1939.44,1942.0800000000002," Yeah. Okay. Let me, uh, they went upon us."
1944.3200000000002,1948.88," Actually, I think this is probably one of the most controversial ones. So this is the one that I will jump to."
1949.3600000000001,1957.44," Hmm. Hmm. And this is putting story in the wrong places. So he's tempted, he says, I was tempted to"
1957.44,1961.8400000000001," come up with seven things not to do and just leave off this, uh, leave off the story one as I'm not sure."
1962.4,1968.88," Sorry. Hold on. Let me start again. I forgot how to read. Look at how small this do. It's,"
1968.88,1973.2, okay. It's very small. I was tempted to come up with seven things not to do and just leave off the story
1973.2,1977.3600000000001, one as I'm sure it's my most controversial point. A bunch of people will disagree with me over the
1977.4399999999998,1981.76, place of story in games. So let me just say it for that I know that I'm wrong. I still want to make my
1981.76,1986.0, point though. I don't like story in games. I don't like the boring cutscenes. I don't like the stereotype
1986.0,1990.24," characters. I don't like the plots that I have no control over. Sorry, by aware you are either"
1990.24,1995.28, God or Satan twist count two. I especially don't like it when games stop me from fast-forwarding through
1995.28,1999.36," crappy dialogue. I'm looking at you, Japan. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay."
1999.36,2004.8," Um, but what I really hate is one story gets stuck somewhere. It really doesn't belong like an"
2004.8799999999999,2009.9199999999998, strategy game. After all strategy games are the original games humans first discovered gameplay with
2009.9199999999998,2015.12, backgammon and chess and go to noble tradition. The story in a strategy game is the game itself.
2015.68,2020.24, Lering went on to an RTS campaign is like putting a copy of Hamlet and my pie. I mean sure Hamlet
2020.24,2025.76," and play play, but my pie would also sure taste better without it. Another way. How much would"
2025.76,2030.0, a better game would rise of legends have been and it was already a great game if they'd given
2030.0,2034.48, up on creating a story based campaign. And instead iterated on the cool conquer the world mode
2034.64,2040.32," from Rise of Nations, ironically the campaign mode was my favorite way to play ROL. I love that"
2040.32,2044.24, you could only acquire technologies and advanced units on the strategic map between missions which
2044.24,2049.04," helped to simplify the core RTS game. However, I enjoyed the campaign despite the story not because of"
2049.04,2052.8," it. The key point here is that for the sake of chasing a story, a big huge game is a misdent"
2052.8,2057.2, opportunity to match a great core RTS with a simple overarching strategy layer that could be infinitely
2057.2,2062.08," replayable. So all of you out there, because that's a lot of reading. I agree and I disagree with"
2062.64,2067.7599999999998, him. I think you know there's a lot of bad story in games because there's just like a lot of bad
2067.7599999999998,2072.7999999999997, writers and a lot of bad story tells those people should not be making them. What about though this?
2072.7999999999997,2078.08, I mean what about his point though that we feel obligated now or that developers feel obligated
2078.72,2083.52, to include narrative in every game regards. I think that they shouldn't have to feel that way
2083.52,2089.2799999999997," you're right, but I do think that in the hands of somebody good, like Blizzard they can tell a cool"
2090.2400000000002,2095.76, story in the in the shape of a campaign even if the gameplay the missions themselves don't have much to
2095.76,2101.0400000000004, do with the story itself. So the craft and workcraft 3 had great story lines in their campaigns and I thought
2101.0400000000004,2105.84," they were a compelling reason to keep playing and fine. Right. Okay, so let you could say in the abstract"
2105.84,2112.5600000000004," each of the maps in Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 2 is like a chessboard, right, where it's a strategy"
2112.5600000000004,2116.96, you want to get together and you don't necessarily need a story to move these units around the map.
2117.52,2122.4, But their actually decent story tellers who were able to draw you in in that way.
2122.4,2128.56, But his eyes are like skeptic but partially because I never played the campaign modes of Starcraft or
2128.56,2134.08, Warcraft 3. But we didn't see it. When we just came out we were all
2135.52,2140.7200000000003, sort of laughing at how still to the the whole notion of using cutscenes with full motion video and
2140.72,2146.7999999999997, real life actors. Yes. Right. But sort of like that was a weird kind of like tongue and cheek throw back too.
2146.7999999999997,2152.0, That one was kind of an anomaly. I don't think any of the command of Tucker games even back when
2153.3599999999997,2158.64, FMB wasn't necessarily extraordinarily cheesy and merely cheesy. Like even those I don't recall having
2158.64,2163.52, like a compelling storyline. Okay. So that's different. I do think I do think though the
2164.56,2169.9199999999996, story can help you like relate to what's going on even in an RTS game to give their some
2169.92,2174.64, per give a give a purpose to the things you see on the screen. Like sometimes I have that feeling when
2174.64,2178.16, I play a game that doesn't have any story and I'm like what are all these little things.
2178.16,2183.92, And I would have more of it. So caliber or street fighter if you didn't know that don't I need I need those
2183.92,2191.2000000000003, innings. I love the things. Yeah. I do think that they they can be irrelevant like the age of
2191.2000000000003,2197.76, Empires games. I think have all been outstanding every time. But the campaigns are totally
2197.84,2202.32, unmemorable. Like that's that's a company to me that how how are great they are they don't
2202.32,2207.28, only know how to tell like a good story. They keep trying they keep telling a kind of good one.
2207.28,2213.36, But the key to that game is for me is the multiplayer and the skirmish mode. So that's a case
2213.36,2217.36, where like they have a bunch of armies and a bunch of game mechanics that are super fun to play.
2218.0,2224.32, But the story yeah. But his rise of legends example like I played that all the way through campaign
2224.4,2227.76, and that didn't have a normal story either. So I think it's just a more a matter of
2227.76,2234.32, you know execution versus not. Yeah. What's this what I'm saying like yes I think that there's
2234.32,2238.8, way too much bad storytelling in games because it's just not enough talented people doing it.
2238.8,2242.48, But if you just put it in the hands of people who can really tell story you'll see
2242.48,2248.0800000000004, Corres also and I think Balshok is one of those. I think Marlinson talking about strategy games.
2248.0800000000004,2253.04, Yeah. He's very specific. He's talking about the entries called in places where they don't
2253.84,2259.12, where they don't belong. You know he only gives strategy games this one option. I would add you know fighting games.
2259.12,2263.52, Like I don't I don't really no I look at him in the same way. Yeah. I was playing it's a good good
2263.52,2268.08, transition in a company here as a posing for you know what hold on you know Street Fighter had a good story.
2268.08,2274.56, They made a movie. Oh I think that's good storytelling. That's it is.
2274.56,2279.7599999999998, I think I might be able to have a fighting game should be able to have a fighting game should be able to have a
2279.84,2285.2000000000003, good story because at least you're dealing with people and like you know a one-person level.
2285.2000000000003,2290.4, Whereas with strategy games the challenge is like how do you make people associate what's happening
2290.4,2296.4, with these few characters and this huge battlefield of thousands of disposable. But I
2296.4,2300.1600000000003, double to play Johnson's advocate. I think you would say the same thing. Do you run into the same
2300.1600000000003,2306.0800000000004, problem if you don't answer for more Fizer checkers pieces or your go pieces? But look at what Warcraft
2306.16,2313.44, did. I mean look at World of Warcraft to me that's like a profound validation of Blizzard storytelling
2313.44,2319.2799999999997, in a strategy game world of that craft. Yeah. But it's not a strategy. No but the entire game evolved
2319.2799999999997,2324.56, out of a strategy game. Yeah. They made the most popular MMO ever which is all about character and
2324.56,2330.08, well not really but there's this huge gigantic storyline that you've got millions of people involved in
2330.08,2335.6, that came from the world they created in a strategy game. Do you read a dialogue bubble when you're
2336.56,2342.24, in a world of work? I read a more than a while than I do in other games. But it is too
2342.24,2346.96, while to get there. But it is too to go back to your point before that Blizzard did have to add the
2346.96,2352.64, option so that this text in the bubble in the dialogue windows didn't scroll on. They had to add a thing.
2352.64,2357.92, So at first at first they did. I don't think I've ever read. I haven't played World of Warcraft
2357.92,2362.64, but in any other MMO I've played I've never read the quest as it was given to me. Yeah I've sold
2362.72,2369.12, it when I get stuck. But the fuck am I doing again? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean they've had to
2369.12,2372.7999999999997, just kind of a belated acknowledgement that like not everyone gives a shit about this craft.
2372.7999999999997,2377.7599999999998, Hmm so. Hey there's no right or wrong answer. I mean I don't get back. I was you know we could
2378.24,2384.0, talking about opposing frontspot in the context of this topic so you guys can still chime in
2384.0,2390.8799999999997, whenever you want that game the original company here is was also acknowledged as has doing something
2390.96,2395.36, right with story. I mean I didn't say that. I didn't review it but I noticed in our views and
2395.36,2400.8, in many reviews and it did work. I mean you get the context. Here's the moment in time that this
2400.8,2405.92, is supposed to be representing and here the forces involved and the wise and the house and stuff.
2405.92,2411.6800000000003, But for me I mean when they would switch to to the cutscene afterward you know and try to like
2411.6800000000003,2416.6400000000003, establish the intensity and the characters and those with some you know cinematic stuff it really didn't
2416.6400000000003,2420.8, do that much for me anymore than like if I started the map and while the maps loading it said
2420.88,2425.92, as oh right here you are on your in current and this you know for this reason and that I mean
2426.32,2430.8, like then when I play the game it's all about okay here the you and that is different too because
2430.8,2435.92, I know without them telling me anything I immediately recognize what this supposed to be representing
2435.92,2440.4, and you know what the unit or stuff but but just playing it like a wood you know like a like
2440.4,2446.08, chess or something or you know even a fighting game and so yeah I guess that's why it's easy for
2446.16,2451.2799999999997, me to sort of go along with them and say hey I can I don't think it's a deal breaker if they
2451.2799999999997,2456.24, ship one of those games without any story I agree I don't think it's a deal breaker it would be
2456.24,2460.72, better if the games that really wanted to tell story focused on that and the games that didn't really
2460.72,2466.4, care just right didn't bother don't have access I agree yeah and the other point I want to make
2466.4,2473.68, that is because since the artist gameplay itself isn't suited to telling a story when even when you know
2474.16,2478.3199999999997, accepting is you say that the blizzard does a great job with the story I'm assuming that that's a
2478.3199999999997,2482.7999999999997, current in between matches yes it is so sometimes well except they would have these briefed
2482.7999999999997,2488.72, elements in the middle of a fight where it might pause and zoom in right yeah in cut like an
2488.72,2494.0, in-game engine scene like what you just heard in point like a reducer and objective and like there's
2494.0,2498.7999999999997, another character there at the objective about the fight you'd have storyline exchanges there sometimes okay
2498.8,2504.4, but basically not right yeah so like my whole thing is just like getting natural I'm all for
2504.4,2510.1600000000003, story in games but provided that it's it's a mode of storytelling that's kind of indigenous to games
2510.7200000000003,2517.92, and those are all examples of like taking stuff from other media from you know TV and from movies
2517.92,2522.6400000000003, and comic books and other formats you know like the dialogue that that I is just like very comic book
2522.6400000000003,2527.44, like you know that example um but that's the real trick I mean and it's probably by our
2527.52,2534.0, shark runs into two because as I was saying before there's for me there's no real character development
2534.0,2539.12, in there in the present tense I mean it's all through the recorders yes anyone who's changed or in
2539.12,2544.56, any way shape or form it's occurring you know through the artifacts that they've left in the environment
2545.28,2549.28, everything else is just killer be killed and that's like another problem with that but the way that they
2549.28,2554.8, I mean they've certainly kind of missed all over again you know you've kind of stumbled into this
2554.88,2559.04, world where everything's been found out in the world yeah long dad and and you just have to sort of
2559.04,2563.1200000000003, figure out what happened here and that's how I mean doomed to be the same way with the same way
2563.1200000000003,2568.7200000000003, future shock you yeah picking up you fell away not at on it's also a way to keep you moving along
2568.7200000000003,2572.88, with the game while you're getting your story fed you continue and it's the only way really to tell
2572.88,2577.6000000000004, story by telling a story through a world it has to be a world you're unfamiliar with so it's always
2577.6000000000004,2582.0800000000004, going to be about like you know plunging into this strange environment and learning about it it's
2582.08,2587.6, evolved to me that's the best way to tell a story in a game and so while like I totally agree with that
2587.6,2593.36, I just wanted to like differentiate so like I appreciate the way that by our shock tells it story
2593.36,2597.7599999999998, with its environment you understand the history of this world by looking at the physical space
2597.7599999999998,2603.52, you're in but I just had character development in the classical sense of a person undergoing some
2603.52,2607.36, sort of change in the way that they they see themselves in the world and the other people that they're
2607.36,2612.7200000000003, interacting with but yeah like I mean and that's what the games do like wonderful I mean do
2612.7200000000003,2618.2400000000002, wonderfully like half life the same way I've said we're you're in the world and just by looking around
2618.2400000000002,2622.96, at it you understand that what its history is contained in itself you know so I thought that's
2622.96,2630.48, what was so cool to bring up a sort of random game to in psychonots that someone figured out you know
2630.48,2634.6400000000003, that games are better told the stories are better told through their environments and then someone
2634.64,2639.52, was like well what if the environment represented a character and let's explore like that is that's a very
2639.52,2646.8799999999997, cool idea good point yeah that was a good game a phenomenal game yeah yeah that was for me the
2646.8799999999997,2651.2, concepts were better in the game play like that was it that was the hook it was like okay what's next
2651.2,2655.2799999999997, you know what am I gonna find in and you know like you're saying each level is a character
2655.2799999999997,2659.2799999999997, what am I gonna see in there but then yeah that was totally an example of the story drawing you
2659.2799999999997,2663.04, along through another wise through a world where yeah go come on in five and get these and we'll let's
2663.04,2668.56, listen to the next area it was based the gameplay that was very much like uh who is it that
2668.56,2673.6, makes banjo and kazooie rare yeah yeah not a fan of the way they do stuff um I almost think that
2673.6,2677.44, that game needed less gameplay like it would have been better it's just like exploring these areas
2677.44,2682.08, and having some sort of minimal amount of things that you did and having it really be about the
2682.08,2687.68, story I thought it was hard that was surprisingly hard yeah the last some bad interface is your
2688.24,2694.48, yeah if miss me it's hard yeah I got only got through that because I like accidentally passed
2694.48,2700.3199999999997, some point it was it was some sort of glitch yeah I asked it out to the game yeah yeah
2701.2,2705.6, so if only it had invited chambers I want you guys to play opposing fronts I was trying all
2705.6,2711.44, weekend yeah to a range where we would have I mean what was the last time like even more than two of
2711.44,2717.6, us in this room of play to game together so I wanted Ryan Sean Jeff I tried I did do diligence all day
2718.0,2722.96, I sent you hourly updates I know from noon or 11 a.m. until 1 a.m.
2722.96,2727.2, good job well I plan it why is it fucking file plan it I mean you know why they all the companies
2727.2,2732.0, put their bait as exclusively on there I mean I just do deals and stuff but it's like a file plan
2732.0,2738.16, it by a faster server fuckheads it's a pain in the yes cause yeah it's totally 13 hour download
2738.16,2745.2, how big was that file megabytes no that's two gigs but two gigs 10 different
2745.2,2752.3199999999997, miles like little Johnny 14 year old downloaded like 30 albums on bit torn it seriously that
2752.3199999999997,2756.8799999999997, took it was ridiculous it took like 13 hours to download the other knowing thing you do there
2756.8799999999997,2760.56, is that you know how you're like okay I could believe that there's a line but there's a
2760.56,2765.68, that whole yeah for opposing fronts beta but then you go on there for some random asshole
2765.68,2770.3999999999996, shit that you know for a factor is not another person on the way you try to get yeah suddenly there's
2770.4,2776.2400000000002, 350 six people and it's the weight yeah you're 65th in line for the dyketana patch
2777.44,2783.04, I'll pay if you paid five dollars a month you wouldn't have to be back here and coach with the other
2783.04,2790.32, losers so true it's so annoying too because it's like it's right it's got to be just a random
2790.32,2794.7200000000003, number generator for that oh yeah yeah they're just we got to suck your hair trying to get the
2794.72,2802.0, that kind of patch given the little screen here yeah I wonder to the whole time that's my 13
2802.0,2807.68, hour down that was going it's like are they just like gone over on their side like because I made
2807.68,2812.0, me wonder oh man if I was in there fucking like subscriber thing would I have been playing like 12
2812.0,2817.2799999999997, hours ago probably so I don't know I'm guessing so you gotta just figure on the switch for like 10
2817.2799999999997,2823.6, seconds okay there you go you do have it so we're gonna have to play this week because it's I have it now
2823.7599999999998,2829.44, so far but the problem is online and this goes with all our TSM guessing unless you have a group of
2829.44,2835.04, people to play with it people are such oh pardon the language they're fucking cute well yeah
2835.04,2840.0, yeah you're like where have you been hold hi we went in and I first got into CO wage but it's like
2840.0,2844.4, okay you make a game or you go into someone's game they look at your you gotta wait
2844.4,2848.3199999999997, as they look at your stats and then you wait and then like okay they're kick you because they don't
2848.3199999999997,2851.92, you they think you're too good or they think you're great and they move you the other team
2851.92,2857.12, because they think you suck and then you wait and wait no one else joins someone else joins and
2857.12,2860.7200000000003, comes in and you're like oh great finally everyone's ready up and he goes no no no wait a minute
2860.7200000000003,2865.36, and he delays the game while he checks everyone stats then he leaves you sit there for fucking hours
2865.36,2870.0, so of course if the game actually started all you would do it be to grieve all those guys anyway
2870.0,2875.6800000000003, now I played this I played this for real man okay I did I did a few maneuvers in it's
2875.68,2879.7599999999998, you wait it's before but it's like that's to do sometime you're in a joking mood you know
2879.7599999999998,2884.56, that usually comes from boredom when you play the game seriously to the point where you're like
2884.56,2889.12, okay we need to like do something we need to new wrinkle on this and that's when you start like
2889.7599999999998,2895.68, creating a concentration camp out of your of your allies HQ building barbar all around it
2895.68,2904.3199999999997, and both the round starts and then building like sandbags and then using the sandbags to spell
2904.4,2916.0800000000004, LOL or I'm defending if you have time I got D sorry yeah so you know wonder why you have trouble
2916.0800000000004,2921.04, getting a game together now I have a new name I'm skin-farted so if you're listening add
2921.04,2926.1600000000003, skin-fart because I'm definitely looking for people to play with and in a lot of my names
2926.1600000000003,2930.96, the games that make maybe it's the game that names like at first I had weird ones like
2930.96,2940.56, uh pp in the tp in the nuh uh phupa hunters you might just want to try like new one
2940.56,2946.56, I did you know no it's been I'm going that game for three might work first it was all you
2946.56,2951.92, to be like necromancer 57 or some shit that's the only way to take you seriously it was right
2951.92,2957.52, it's the only one in that game yeah it's not quite no because there's all cut there's always
2957.6,2962.72, people with names like SS this and that they come in and I kicked them the fuck's up with that but uh
2962.72,2967.12, no first it was like new zone or like new zone league you know stuff like that that should
2967.12,2971.28, like go that's gonna be great but I guess that's the code word for like yes merfs you know yeah so
2971.28,2973.84, then I changed it to all that like phupa planet and stuff
2975.04,2985.6, go to phupa it's right no phupa is a phat upper area the p is the we're all looking a scant
2986.08,2995.92, okay so bad this was a phat upper pussy area oh what what what what what what what what what
2995.92,3001.2, I don't see that coming now I was going through in my mind all the possibilities for p and that was
3001.2,3009.36, definitely not one of them okay okay okay property fat property area yeah there we go okay
3009.52,3015.84, it's also gun is a synonym but we used it because the tanks the British have this awesome
3016.56,3022.6400000000003, Churchill with a a guitar cannon on it and it sounds like a phupa when it launches so we just
3022.6400000000003,3028.48, started calling that the phupa or the phupa nater and then like so after a while then I was like I just
3028.48,3033.2000000000003, assumed the rest of the world should be like up on it so the phupa that's it that's the crocodile
3033.3599999999997,3042.72, with the who at the launcher on it of course yes John runs on his own internal logic
3042.72,3046.3199999999997, also you know don't you all saved the gate well yeah we'll just talk around the game like this and then
3046.3199999999997,3051.6, went once you guys have got to play it and we can have like how many maps are there in conversation
3051.6,3058.3199999999997, multiply in the beta the beta here why does you because um well they're only I think they're only
3058.56,3063.6800000000003, maybe there's like eight all together or ten but one new one and then one of the old ones
3063.6800000000003,3067.52, but you could play the new armies on it you could play the old armies and the new arm okay any
3067.52,3073.04, combination and can you play against the uh AI yeah you play that's all it's been playing because no
3073.04,3078.0, okay I'm in the phupa hunters so I was playing with laughing that's series business so
3079.52,3085.04, we would just do against the CPU put them on hard okay which is kind of annoying because the CPU the
3085.04,3091.6, AI is just like it's just like as holy eye it doesn't know how to react anything all it does
3091.6,3095.68, it's just try to break your supply lines and just sending out random guys to like break your lines
3095.68,3100.32, and cap stuff and it's just annoying like oh god here comes the uh capsicul again which is uh
3101.2799999999997,3107.44, the new army the pans are elite is basically uh it's like the asshole army if you're like what
3107.44,3111.84, what can we do to create you know uh new armies in this game that play differently than once there
3111.92,3117.04, and pans are really it's definitely it's like the asshole army it's like they have these little
3117.04,3120.88, cycles that are super quick and they're just like annoying nuts but the cap things really quick
3120.88,3125.84, and they get around fast between stuff so you basically just send them out to uh break break
3125.84,3131.52, go say it's a plylines and then you can get some powers where um you know you booby trap
3131.52,3135.28, something that you capture so the next the enemies go when they try to retake it from you blows
3135.28,3139.6800000000003, them in their face and kills them or you can go and capture some of their territory like say you
3139.7599999999998,3144.3199999999997, know that all the logistics in the game are fuel ammunition and manpower and
3145.3599999999997,3149.04, when you cap the you have to cap these points to keep that you know flowing through
3149.04,3152.7999999999997, but so you go and then you can destroy it and then that means the enemies if they want it back
3152.7999999999997,3156.96, they have to rebuild it before they can even recapture it so it's just stuff like that yeah it's
3156.96,3161.6, just total scorch there stuff but when you look at it and like it first I didn't get it because
3162.3199999999997,3166.3199999999997, everything else just makes sense like okay artillery this seems great I know you know all these
3166.4,3170.8, defensive bunkers and trenches and stuff like I mean you understand why this is going to be
3170.8,3175.36, useful but then when you first play the pans are elite you're like okay they're not you know they
3175.36,3180.56, don't have juggernaut tanks and stuff in the same the same capacity that the regular vermark does
3180.56,3184.96, what are what am I gonna do with them and then like yeah and then it kind of clicked in the mic
3185.76,3191.36, so the that's the fuel race yeah yeah I don't know yeah I mean it's it's it's it's so hard to say I
3191.36,3195.36, mean I'm sure you know relic wants they're having a beta because they want to see how this all
3195.44,3199.6800000000003, balances out but if I could find some good players from from either army that's the other thing is
3199.6800000000003,3204.2400000000002, no people do join your game they pick the old class it's a go fucking play company here is now
3204.2400000000002,3208.1600000000003, why are you playing opposing fronts if you're not even gonna like try the new stuff they want to win
3208.1600000000003,3212.8, and so I was trying to find really good pans really players to see what they did and then save you know
3213.36,3217.36, actually they don't have the they've a replay option disabled but at least pay attention enough to see
3217.36,3221.76, what they were doing that was working really well yeah we'll come back to that later it's really fun
3221.76,3227.2000000000003, I'm liking it a lot I'm excited to play more tonight so we'll come back to it
3227.2000000000003,3233.0400000000004, hmm the first game company here is with a fine game do we need a are we done they never even took a break
3233.0400000000004,3238.2400000000002, we should take a break we're almost hitting an hour here okay y'all's a we didn't okay

3304.7200000000003,3309.76, so this is series business we're gonna talk about uh TV game shows nowadays
3310.7200000000003,3315.5200000000004, what had are we all done with PC gaming is that I think that's a deal no one
3315.5200000000004,3320.4, volunteered up any uh any topics and are looking right there this is the extra special second half
3320.4,3326.0800000000004, and what we've just opened it up to random content in general if you can turn this shit off
3326.0800000000004,3331.1200000000003, uh uh if you well you probably already did the first time I said pooper there's another one for you
3331.1200000000003,3339.2000000000003, if you keep in track drinking game out of it uh so okay at TV games shows nowadays I just saw
3339.2,3344.16, something that night and they always piss me off because you know back in the day it used to be
3344.96,3351.04, yeah grandpa yeah back in my day you know you'd have jeopardy or something they have all these
3351.04,3355.2799999999997, questions and half the time you're like how do I know the answer that I don't know about the answer
3355.2799999999997,3360.0, that and all you do is you hit the button if you know the answer and if you fucking know it you say it
3360.0,3364.8799999999997, if you don't you shut up and you lose your points in the next person talks nowadays on the game show
3365.04,3370.08, it's the dumbest fucking questions in the world with the stupidest asshole taken like as long as
3370.08,3375.52, he possibly can to tell you he doesn't or does know the answer so you know like and that's the
3375.52,3379.76, whole game show now no one even just like jeopardy is about the questions do you or do you know
3379.76,3385.84, or do you not um now it's like you just assume that you would assume that the whole world should know
3385.84,3389.92, the regardless of education and you know whatever background they should know the answers to these
3389.92,3396.08, ask not questions immediately but instead they get these fucking greasy motherfuckers to say
3398.32,3404.08, trying to spice it up now to be like I don't know let me call up my cousin see what he thinks about
3404.08,3408.08, this and it's not just you who wants to be a millionaire everything now it's like it's got some
3408.48,3413.44, like you consult you know you get it you get a look in like the dictionary you get to uh it's like
3413.44,3417.44, when they start letting you bring calculator and the math test I still can't believe they do that
3418.4,3423.52, that's still pisses me off when I know you mean about like the whole like waiting forever
3423.52,3428.8, and I hate the dramatic pause when someone does give the answer you ask yeah like how many horns
3428.8,3435.04, doesn't unicorn have you're like one I think they're like really one no but you have to find out
3435.04,3440.48, you don't even just say one they go okay I'm thinking of one because uni is a prefix often but
3440.48,3445.76, not always means one but then I don't know I've seen you know how many animals do you know
3445.92,3453.5200000000004, they don't have one horn I don't know I'm gonna use I'm gonna pull the audience
3453.5200000000004,3460.6400000000003, my uncle's a dead okay 75.6% of the audience say one that's like the NBC watch show it's like
3460.6400000000003,3464.88, one versus a hundred or something like that or one yeah all those show down on the video where you're
3464.88,3470.0800000000004, playing you're playing against the whole audience right so I'll they'll say you know
3470.4,3477.52, whatever this this Georgian peanut farmer became president of the United States
3478.48,3485.2799999999997, his name rhymes with martyr and then they'll pull the audience in like 80% said Nixon
3487.2799999999997,3492.96, hell this guy is stupid and he was all over with a that dealer no deal one where because like the
3492.96,3497.84, question isn't even about a president it's literally like all right what's the number between one
3498.08,3505.52, and 64 yeah all let's see my grandmother was born in August so it might be a
3505.52,3511.2000000000003, that's so again her father was born in the 23rd so maybe it's a 23 let me take the difference between
3511.2000000000003,3516.1600000000003, him they that's your freaks me out to know and because then they'll pick the number I talk about this
3516.1600000000003,3520.88, with my kid all the time because she and I watch it and she's only 13 and she watches it in like
3520.88,3526.08, you know horror for humanity you know because we're sitting there and when someone picks a number
3526.24,3530.7999999999997, everybody including the models who are holding the number well like clap for the guy like good joy
3531.84,3538.7999999999997, yeah 32 yeah oh yes good one they're just delay they don't want to get that much of a number
3538.7999999999997,3542.56, they drag that up for a full hour they had they had did you guys see the one that's like are you
3542.56,3549.2, smart and the third graders that was like that was basically the fifth grader yeah sorry I didn't
3549.2,3555.6, watch it yeah it was the same thing instead of that the idiot audience it's like then they get the
3555.6,3559.6, smart like a kid audience it's supposed to be you know grade school there's something
3559.6,3564.24, and uh there's a bingo night one did you see that imagine playing bingo at the motherfucker
3564.24,3570.16, that pulled the number out of the the air shooter took 20 minutes to tell you what it was you can kill
3570.16,3576.96, that dude you're right there you're so fast I guess I guess like how do you feel you got b24 how does that
3576.96,3581.92, make you feel how would you describe you feel I'm feeling positive about b24 I think b24 is a really
3582.88,3590.08, a few tingling my good yeah no but I guess people I guess the game shows are more popular when you
3590.08,3594.32, make the questions down there because maybe more people can answer them right yeah you're just
3594.32,3599.2000000000003, making a stupid yeah I want you're a fair point extra one that's because all he does is
3599.2000000000003,3604.8, sitting his room and read the anti-capidian masturbate my my my my wife my wife watches
3604.8,3610.2400000000002, jeopardy and I cannot fucking stand it I sit there on the couch no but this problem is watching with
3610.8799999999997,3616.08, it's the metal of a joker yeah she says she always has to say the the anthra out loud and she's
3616.08,3620.4799999999996, really fast about it yeah and so it totally ruins it for me because she's ever they're like answering
3620.4799999999996,3624.16, every quest so you're just mad because she's smarter think well she's smarter than me but then she'll
3624.16,3629.12, just randomly guess things too and that just focuses my head you just say that flexion though dude like
3629.12,3635.2799999999997, caught you I don't know what we're doing it's always the wrong thing you're screaming what's the
3635.28,3642.6400000000003, price is right that's the price is right is classic yeah that's what a game of shit
3642.6400000000003,3646.96, right it's not gonna be the same with that Bob just one big commercial that's what every it is it's

3913.04,3914.04, It's.
3914.04,3916.04, It sounds like he's saying shaman.
3916.04,3918.04, Oh yeah.

3922.04,3923.04, Okay.
3923.04,3924.04, No.
3924.04,3925.04, That's the one where he says that.
3925.04,3927.04, And I don't know.
3927.04,3928.04, But there's another song.
3929.04,3931.04, You guys don't know Michael Jackson.
3931.04,3932.04, You know Michael Jackson.
3932.04,3934.04, My eight year old knows Michael Jackson.
3934.04,3936.04, I mean me as an aero.
3936.04,3937.04, But um.
3937.04,3938.04, But I don't remember.
3938.04,3939.04, Now.
3939.04,3940.04," Oh, forget about."
3940.04,3942.04, You know actually when I was in kindergarten.
3942.04,3944.04, The first kindergarten I ever went to.
3944.04,3945.04, My teacher.
3945.04,3947.04," It was a Christian school in Grand Prairie, Texas."
3947.04,3949.04, I was wearing a glittery Michael Jackson shirt.
3949.04,3952.04, And she told me that Michael Jackson was a servant of the devil.
3952.04,3954.04, And my mom pulled me out of school the next day.
3954.04,3955.04, I'll kill my right.
3955.04,3956.04, She was right.
3956.04,3957.04, Yeah.
3957.04,3958.04, Yeah.
3958.04,3959.04, You didn't know.
3959.04,3960.04, So did you quit listening to him?
3960.04,3961.04, No.
3961.04,3962.04, No.
3962.04,3963.04, I mean my mom took me out of the school because she was like mad about it.
3963.04,3967.04," Oh, you get the opposite of my dad who found I had this really or vinyl."
3967.04,3969.04, And he was reading like the lyrics on the inside.
3969.04,3972.04, And he saw it Billy Jean that it said.
3972.04,3975.04, It was the fact that it didn't even matter what it said.
3975.04,3976.04, It said 40 days and 40 nights.
3976.04,3978.04," And he was like, that's biblical."
3978.04,3979.04, That's sacralage.
3979.04,3981.04, And then he told you before that reason.
3981.04,3982.04, That was the trash.
3982.04,3983.04, Wow.
3983.04,3984.04, And then that retarded.
3984.04,3985.04, That was like in.
3985.04,3987.04, I wasn't grade school and then it listened to music again.
3987.04,3993.04, It tells you your high and then it was like strictly like just read them stuff like
3993.04,3994.04," Oh, punk and gosh."
3994.04,3995.04, Yeah.
3995.04,3996.04, That's my fairly video.
3996.04,3998.04, I had that disclaimer read at the beginning about the.
3998.04,4001.04, It did not endorseing belief in the occult.
4001.04,4002.04, Wow.
4002.04,4003.04, Yeah.
4003.04,4004.04, For parents like that.
4004.04,4005.04, Yeah.
4005.04,4007.04, So how does he explain that his face is melted now?
4007.04,4009.04, My mom's on fucking out of hardship.
4009.04,4012.04, My mom did not mind what kind of music I listed.
4012.04,4013.04, That was man.
4013.04,4014.04, What did that?
4015.04,4019.04, Actually my second tape was was flashed ants the soundtrack.
4019.04,4023.04," And it was because I'd seen the movie, which now when I watched it later,"
4023.04,4025.04," like as in a like a grown up with hormones,"
4025.04,4028.04," I was like, whoa, this is like a sex in it."
4028.04,4031.04," But when I was a kid, I remember like, I love that movie about dancing."
4031.04,4033.04, That's a good movie.
4033.04,4037.04, And I used to listen to soundtrack and clean my room because I was.
4037.04,4039.04, I was definitely home sexual when I was a kid.
4039.04,4040.04, I don't know what happened.
4040.04,4042.04, But then I like girls.
4042.04,4043.04, I was weird.
4043.04,4045.04, But like a little bit of an overshadow.
4045.04,4048.04, As a sexual.
4048.04,4049.04, I just like a sexual.
4049.04,4050.04, I feel like a sexual.
4050.04,4054.04, I just really like to listen to the flash dance soundtrack and clean my room.
4054.04,4055.04, It's other wrong with that.
4055.04,4056.04, There's not the wrong one.
4056.04,4057.04, There we go.
4057.04,4058.04, Yeah.
4058.04,4059.04, All right.
4059.04,4060.04, What about the only more?
4060.04,4061.04, Okay.
4061.04,4062.04, All right.
4062.04,4064.04," Guys, we just got to get these filthy secrets out."
4064.04,4065.04," Keep coming, Ryan."
4065.04,4067.04, This is shidiest out in your collection.
4067.04,4068.04, What?
4068.04,4070.04, What's the shidiest out in your collection?
4071.04,4074.04, What's the worst piece of music you all didn't listen to?
4074.04,4075.04, And love.
4075.04,4077.04, Or as a child.
4077.04,4079.04, Some ish that you don't want anyone to know about.
4079.04,4080.04, Right.
4080.04,4081.04, We dare you.
4081.04,4082.04, We double dog.
4082.04,4083.04," Gary, you've gone."
4083.04,4084.04, What is it?
4084.04,4085.04, I got to think about that.
4085.04,4086.04, Right.
4086.04,4088.04, And you can spend so many bad ones on my collection.
4088.04,4089.04, I wouldn't even know where to start.
4089.04,4090.04," Actually, most of them are gone now."
4090.04,4094.04," But in my collection in the past, I've had Chicago records."
4094.04,4096.04, So that's a pretty bad shit.
4096.04,4098.04," Like Newers Chicago, like the other."
4098.04,4100.04," Oh, god, not before Peter sat there."
4100.04,4102.04," Oh, I mean, before Peter sat there to go."
4102.04,4103.04," Oh, I see."
4103.04,4105.04, And neutered the hard rock that was Chicago.
4105.04,4109.04, Because it was really packing a lot.
4109.04,4110.04," Oh, yeah."
4110.04,4111.04, That was some hard score.
4111.04,4112.04, Scents.
4112.04,4113.04, Saturday.
4113.04,4114.04, Bale.
4114.04,4115.04, In the park.
4115.04,4116.04, Bale.
4116.04,4119.04, That was some hard rocket shit.
4119.04,4120.04, Yeah.
4120.04,4122.04," When you're 10, that sounds cool."
4122.04,4124.04, I did with her was the fourth of July.
4124.04,4126.04, Those guys are right.
4127.04,4132.04," See, my mom gave me a John Denver record once."
4132.04,4138.04," And back, this is before your guys day, but back in the day when they had this stuff called vinyl."
4138.04,4143.04, RCA records at one point was experimenting with this kind of like bendable vinyl.
4143.04,4145.04," You know, so you could like that was a big selling point."
4145.04,4148.04," Like, hey, now you're just talking on kind of break."
4148.04,4152.04, And this John Denver record that my mom gave me was so fucking bad.
4152.04,4155.04," I mean, because it wasn't just done."
4155.04,4157.04," Denver, it was like late John Denver."
4157.04,4158.04, Yeah.
4158.04,4159.04, So it's like post his hits.
4159.04,4162.04, So I took the thing to see how far I could bend it.
4162.04,4165.04, And it broke into like 50 pieces.
4165.04,4167.04, And I felt bad because my mom gave it to me.
4167.04,4170.04, So I just shoved all the pieces into the thing.
4170.04,4173.04, And then she came in one day and asked if she could bar.
4173.04,4177.04," Oh, no, mom, don't pick up the no."
4177.04,4180.04, Here's this feeling bad over stuff that mom got you.
4180.04,4184.04, One time we're having this epic GI Joe battle.
4184.04,4185.04," My friends, Yard."
4185.04,4187.04, We had like this was like a third grade or something.
4187.04,4188.04, We'd go into his dog house.
4188.04,4189.04, It was big ass dog.
4189.04,4191.04, We'd go in there and like trade toys.
4191.04,4195.04," But one time we had this big thing going where we, you know,"
4195.04,4196.04, we came up with a story for everything.
4196.04,4197.04, And it ended.
4197.04,4201.04," I convinced them that Baroness, who's like this evil wench from Cobra."
4201.04,4203.04, She's like the terrorist organization.
4203.04,4204.04, She had it.
4204.04,4207.04, She had to be like punished for for a shout out.
4207.04,4208.04, She was doing something.
4208.04,4210.04, And so like capital punishment.
4210.04,4213.04, So we always like do there's a hatchet over by the wood shed.
4213.04,4215.04, We got to do this shit.
4215.04,4218.04, So like a first pull their hair off is like rubber.
4218.04,4221.04," And then like I convinced them like hatchet, hatchet head."
4221.04,4223.04, And then we put red marker on it.
4223.04,4226.04," And after we were done, we saw,"
4226.04,4228.04, D.D. that was incredible man.
4228.04,4230.04, We had because we took it.
4230.04,4232.04," I also convinced them to take his Cobra Rattler,"
4232.04,4235.04," which is like an eight-hand word hog, but all done up in blue."
4235.04,4236.04, And we tied it to a string.
4236.04,4239.04, We're spinning around like a really gig and letting it go.
4240.04,4242.04, And then like crash into the ground.
4242.04,4244.04, But then after we're jab your weight.
4244.04,4246.04, And for the there's no payoff on the flair.
4246.04,4249.04," The payoff is that after we're already started to cry,"
4249.04,4251.04, like he was like really crying because.
4251.04,4252.04, But more about me that.
4252.04,4254.04, And he was like trying to put it back together.
4254.04,4255.04, And it was so pathetic looking.
4255.04,4257.04, It was all right on the stubs.
4257.04,4259.04, He was just like trying to hold it together.
4259.04,4260.04, And pretend it would fix stuff.
4260.04,4261.04, Oh.
4261.04,4262.04, That's sad.
4262.04,4263.04, You're me.
4263.04,4264.04, You're me.
4264.04,4265.04, I told you terrible.
4265.04,4266.04, Me and little kids.
4266.04,4268.04," So I'm like, where's the reckoning of collection?"
4269.04,4272.04, Currently the one that sticks out every time I'm going through the.
4272.04,4273.04, Yeah.
4273.04,4274.04, The collecting is like a Richard Mark CD.
4274.04,4275.04, Oh man.
4275.04,4277.04, I don't have some bad shit.
4277.04,4278.04, I don't know why it's there.
4278.04,4279.04, I'm pretty sure I bought it.
4279.04,4280.04, I don't remember why.
4280.04,4281.04, Wow.
4281.04,4282.04, Yeah.
4282.04,4285.04, You can't remember the song that I think it was a hazard.
4285.04,4286.04, I remember a hazard.
4286.04,4287.04, I don't know.
4287.04,4288.04, I don't know.
4288.04,4290.04, I don't listen to Richard Mark's fan.
4290.04,4291.04, I don't know.
4291.04,4292.04, But yeah.
4292.04,4293.04, That's the one that every time.
4293.04,4294.04, I don't think they're going to be like a church.
4294.04,4295.04, It sounds like.
4295.04,4296.04," It's like, it's exactly that."
4296.04,4297.04, It's really soft.
4297.04,4298.04, It's really soft.
4298.04,4300.04, I can get one by couldn't hurt of lie.
4300.04,4302.04, I can't even ever want to cutie G.
4302.04,4303.04, No.
4303.04,4307.04, My mom gave me a canie G CD when I was in like seventh grade.
4307.04,4308.04, Why?
4308.04,4309.04, I don't know.
4309.04,4311.04, Because she thought you like jazz.
4311.04,4313.04," Well, I think that she just thought that I would like it."
4313.04,4315.04, And I listened to it.
4315.04,4316.04, I didn't really get it.
4316.04,4317.04, That kind of.
4317.04,4318.04, But it was because then the time was really.
4318.04,4320.04, Be it on the head with it.
4320.04,4323.04, At the time I was really in my like Nirvana phase.
4323.04,4325.04," It's kind of like, thanks."
4325.04,4328.04," And then I put it on me like, what is this?"
4328.04,4333.04," Yeah, Kenny G was going to be on a third Nirvana album if they hadn't broken up or because"
4333.04,4335.04, Kurt Cobain killed himself.
4335.04,4336.04, That's why he killed him.
4336.04,4340.04, They were going to use a Saxon set of vocals.
4340.04,4342.04, That would have actually been the most amazing album.
4342.04,4346.04," That I mean, I wish that something like that existed."
4346.04,4349.04, You've right Ryan has got his iPod here with him.
4349.04,4350.04, But he won't hand it over.
4351.04,4353.04," Oh, it's happening."
4353.04,4354.04, It's not.
4354.04,4355.04, It's not.
4355.04,4356.04, It's not.
4356.04,4357.04, It's not.
4357.04,4358.04, It's not.
4358.04,4359.04, It's not.
4359.04,4361.04, I'm very weird when it comes to music.
4361.04,4364.04," Like, does that matter not mean final fantasy?"
4364.04,4365.04, It does.
4365.04,4366.04, But we knew this about Ryan.
4366.04,4367.04, We did.
4367.04,4368.04, I sure we did.
4368.04,4369.04, You can look at him.
4369.04,4370.04, Yeah.
4370.04,4371.04, Yeah.
4371.04,4372.04, I have.
4372.04,4373.04, I have.
4373.04,4374.04, It's been in denial all this time.
4374.04,4375.04, I have.
4375.04,4376.04, I think he listened to.
4376.04,4377.04, I won't tell him.
4377.04,4378.04, But he got what he got.
4378.04,4379.04, Does he look like a Jay Z fan?
4379.04,4381.04," I mean, like the dumbest thing other than."
4381.04,4387.04, I want to assume the video game music that dumb like P3 players like some and then he's pretty stupid.
4387.04,4388.04, What about?
4388.04,4391.04, I used to sit there with a tape recorder in front of my second.
4391.04,4393.04, I did that too.
4393.04,4394.04, I used to know.
4394.04,4396.04, The Genesis music was terrible.
4396.04,4397.04, Not getting you.
4397.04,4399.04, Genesis has a terrible sound.
4399.04,4400.04, Did you have a terrible?
4400.04,4403.04," You're like, you think you work, Sean Elliott?"
4403.04,4404.04, You got a cassette tape.
4404.04,4406.04, You're in a room for alerts.
4406.04,4407.04, I still don't have it.
4408.04,4410.04," At the time, I was like, man, this is a cool thing."
4410.04,4411.04, It's so good.
4411.04,4412.04," Oh, yeah."
4412.04,4413.04," Oh, yeah."
4413.04,4416.04, All I remember in my youth is turn that shit down.
4416.04,4419.04, I used to do that with Sierra game.
4419.04,4420.04, Yeah.
4420.04,4421.04, Yeah.
4421.04,4422.04, Yeah.
4422.04,4423.04, I like game music.
4423.04,4425.04," I mean, some of it's really, really catchy."
4425.04,4431.04, I think it was better actually when things were like so minimal that people had to worry about coming up with something you could listen to you.
4431.04,4432.04, Repetitiously.
4432.04,4433.04, Right.
4433.04,4436.04, And now people just do this kind of boring like film soundtrack stuff.
4436.04,4439.04," You know, I liked it better when I was all."
4439.04,4440.04, Yeah.
4440.04,4441.04, Yeah.
4441.04,4442.04, Yeah.
4442.04,4444.04, Yeah.
4444.04,4445.04, Fickery hours.
4445.04,4446.04," Wait, man."
4446.04,4448.04, I don't imagine that.
4448.04,4449.04, I don't.
4449.04,4452.04," Come in through your 13 year, 13 inch bedroom television."
4452.04,4453.04, Yeah.
4453.04,4454.04, Yeah.
4454.04,4456.04, To like this like 1950s tape recording.
4456.04,4459.04, I'm really wish you had that tape now.
4459.04,4460.04," Oh, my God."
4460.04,4461.04, I wish.
4461.04,4462.04, That could be a piece of great.
4462.04,4463.04, Let's try to think the worst I had.
4463.04,4464.04, Somehow I did.
4464.04,4465.04, I ended up with the technatronic tape at one point.
4465.04,4466.04, I don't remember.
4466.04,4467.04, I gave me that.
4467.04,4468.04, That's that pump.
4468.04,4469.04, Up the chain pump.
4469.04,4470.04, Yeah.
4470.04,4471.04, Why you're a footballer.
4471.04,4472.04, I was in a game.
4472.04,4473.04, Were they engaged me in the show?
4473.04,4478.04, This is turned into that shit.
4478.04,4479.04, I was a bit of an ice.
4479.04,4486.04," You know, you do like the circle with your hand and you put it below your knee and try to get your friends to like check it out and then you get the punch him in the arm."
4486.04,4490.04," So if you guys let me get away with saying that, you get to keep hitting you."
4490.04,4491.04," Yo, dude."
4491.04,4492.04, I just skinned my knee.
4492.04,4493.04, Look.
4493.04,4494.04, There we are.
4494.04,4497.04, There's a version of that in that movie called Waiting.
4497.04,4498.04, You ever see that?
4498.04,4499.04, Don't bother if you haven't.
4499.04,4502.04, I don't even know how it ended up at our internet.
4502.04,4503.04, Flick's Q.
4503.04,4505.04, But I don't know what you're talking about.
4505.04,4514.04," So, but the guys that work in the kitchen basically have a scam where they have is like ball games and if they get they make these different shapes and stuff with their ball sack and if they get you don't look at it."
4514.04,4518.04, When you come in then they get to like punch you or you have.
4518.04,4520.04, Or you have to ride them around.
4520.04,4522.04, So why don't you know like there's different you know there's like the.
4522.04,4525.04, What are the possible shape like you're going to make with your balls?
4525.04,4526.04, I just think of that.
4526.04,4527.04, It's like it's kind of one.
4527.04,4528.04, There's like a turtle.
4528.04,4529.04, There's like the bat wing.
4529.04,4533.04, Then they want them for like it looks like a piece of chicken like on the.
4533.04,4535.04, They show it in the news.
4535.04,4537.04, Then show time to figure these things out.
4537.04,4538.04, It's like on the on the on the on the.
4538.04,4539.04, Then they be reading the.
4539.04,4542.04, There's an epic one and you have to put on the meat counter.
4542.04,4545.04, Ryan is making the looks and this.
4545.04,4548.04, It's not a lie agree with him.
4548.04,4550.04, What does happen to this podcast?
4550.04,4553.04, I mean this week is no one playing games at all.
4553.04,4555.04," Yeah, I mean I'm the only one."
4555.04,4557.04," Well, opposing fronts all weekend and that's what my fault."
4557.04,4559.04, So I can only just lecture on it.
4559.04,4560.04, I played a lot of I played track.
4560.04,4561.04, I play track all weekend.
4561.04,4562.04, I play.
4562.04,4564.04, I play and broke broken sword once you play beyond the sword.
4564.04,4567.04, I played Final Fantasy for events this weekend.
4567.04,4568.04, It doesn't count.
4568.04,4571.04, Backman C E played some of that.
4571.04,4572.04, Let's talk about it.
4572.04,4573.04," Dude, I'm the king of that game."
4573.04,4574.04, I'm not.
4574.04,4576.04, Backman C E.
4576.04,4577.04," Yeah, like I."
4577.04,4580.04, I know because I like all of my Zif friends at least.
4580.04,4582.04, I'm on the top of what's your.
4582.04,4583.04, I don't remember.
4583.04,4584.04, I don't remember.
4584.04,4585.04, I'm a head of Greg.
4585.04,4586.04, Wow.
4586.04,4588.04, What's Greg score for the five minute challenge.
4588.04,4589.04, One.
4589.04,4590.04, I don't know.
4590.04,4591.04, I don't remember.
4591.04,4592.04, It's like two hundred and ninety something.
4592.04,4595.04, I can't remember what what my score was.
4595.04,4596.04, All I remember is once I beat Greg.
4596.04,4597.04, I was like.
4597.04,4598.04, Yeah.
4598.04,4599.04, But I was playing that call.
4599.04,4601.04, I was really for a couple of weeks.
4601.04,4602.04, Yeah.
4602.04,4605.04," I could have been playing space giraffe, which I realize most people."
4605.04,4607.04, I think it's like the stupidest thing.
4607.04,4608.04, But I really enjoy it.
4608.04,4609.04, And it's totally ridiculous.
4609.04,4611.04, I don't understand that game at all.
4611.04,4613.04, But I think that's kind of the charm.
4613.04,4614.04, Like all the moves sounds.
4614.04,4615.04, And if you guys don't know it's a Jeff.
4615.04,4616.04, It's a shipman.
4616.04,4617.04, Yeah.
4617.04,4620.04," Jeff Mentors, like totally mind bogglingly fucking crazy."
4620.04,4623.04, Shooter featuring tons of live stock.
4623.04,4629.04, Sounds and completely incomprehensible psychedelic visuals.
4629.04,4631.04, But it's actually a lot of fun.
4631.04,4633.04, If you finally understand the concept.
4633.04,4634.04, It takes like 10 minutes.
4634.04,4636.04, Just to get it.
4636.04,4637.04, Hopefully we'll be able to talk.
4637.04,4641.04, Is that on the PIS on Sony network or is it on my life?
4641.04,4642.04, Yeah.
4642.04,4647.04," Because we know, I mean, one of these days we'll get to talk about all the live arcade stuff on PC."
4647.04,4652.04," And hopefully I'm hoping that if although I'm wondering because it's Microsoft,"
4652.04,4657.04," that everything we've already paid for, we should immediately have access to on the PC version."
4657.04,4659.04, So that's one of our big questions for sure.
4659.04,4660.04, I should be able to play the game.
4660.04,4661.04, I win those live.
4661.04,4662.04, Yeah.
4662.04,4664.04, Hopefully we're working on getting answers for him.
4664.04,4665.04, But that wouldn't that be great.
4665.04,4667.04," I mean, that would be such a huge."
4667.04,4668.04," I mean, that's the right thing to do."
4668.04,4669.04, And that will be right.
4669.04,4673.04, I can all of a sudden I can play all those games that I already bought on PC now.
4673.04,4674.04," Or you know, vice versa."
4674.04,4676.04, You just buy it once and then you get it for both.
4676.04,4677.04, Yeah.
4677.04,4678.04, Fetchance.
4678.04,4680.04, It's why is it that we assume that?
4680.04,4682.04," That's so, you know, kind of sucks that we do."
4682.04,4683.04, It is cynical.
4683.04,4685.04," But it's like, I think we honestly believe it."
4685.04,4686.04, I do believe.
4686.04,4688.04," I mean, now I'm thinking that no way."
4688.04,4690.04," I'm thinking if I want to play it again,"
4690.04,4691.04, I'm going to have to download it again.
4692.04,4693.04," Well, Mike, I know."
4693.04,4695.04," And said, did what there be to give that to for free."
4695.04,4696.04, Right.
4696.04,4697.04, When they know that they can charge.
4697.04,4699.04, It would be fun and it's a hard day for it.
4699.04,4700.04, Not that we know a lot of people.
4700.04,4701.04, Right.
4701.04,4705.04," So I tried to make trying to think like, you know, like someone who wants money."
4705.04,4707.04," And on PC, I don't think this will fly."
4707.04,4709.04," And I hope it doesn't, but the whole, uh,"
4709.04,4713.04, the whole shame box scenario where you can only get him in certain denominations.
4713.04,4716.04," So it's like, when I had 200 left and I wanted pack man,"
4716.04,4718.04, but it was like 800 or something.
4718.04,4721.04," And however it worked out, I had to get stuck with as many as I had."
4721.04,4725.04," It's like I can't, the only way to get rid of that surplus is I like a picture pack or something."
4725.04,4727.04," On some ridiculous trick, a crack."
4727.04,4728.04," Yeah, just."
4728.04,4730.04, Or you get a couple of jempags for three bucks.
4730.04,4731.04, That's a fucking steal.
4731.04,4733.04, That's great.
4733.04,4735.04," So like, it better not be shame bucks."
4735.04,4736.04, It's better be or you could just buy.
4736.04,4739.04, It's like an exact one to one conversion ratio ratio.
4739.04,4742.04, And you can get just the amount you want.
4742.04,4745.04, Like a goodbye by the individual point if you want.
4745.04,4747.04, If something's 15 points and you can just get.
4748.04,4749.04, That stuff's annoying.
4749.04,4751.04, I echo fat chance again.
4751.04,4752.04, I don't know.
4752.04,4755.04," I mean, if they really want to make games for Windows, like, you know,"
4755.04,4757.04," something that people are into, then."
4757.04,4759.04, I'm sorry.
4759.04,4760.04, I'm sorry.
4760.04,4762.04, You're telling a joke.
4762.04,4764.04, Then I don't see why they wouldn't want.
4764.04,4768.04," I mean, it seems like they're making quite a bit of cash off Xbox Live or Kate."
4768.04,4769.04, Why not?
4769.04,4770.04, They are.
4770.04,4774.04," But I mean, they're like steam and it's steam community and everything that they're doing there."
4774.04,4776.04, They're just going to what they're fucking ass if that's what they come out and do.
4776.04,4777.04, And they don't acknowledge that.
4777.04,4784.04," Hey, you know, these guys are bending over backwards to give you all the same functionality and more and let you get one thing."
4784.04,4785.04, And that's it.
4785.04,4788.04, And when you buy something and it's multiple components come in it.
4788.04,4791.04, You can give the ones you don't use the way to friends.
4791.04,4796.04," You can let people play, you know, you send away codes if you bought a game so they can play it with you on certain weekends."
4796.04,4797.04," I mean, all these things."
4797.04,4801.04," I mean, if you just sit there and think, what's the way I can just ring the."
4801.04,4804.04, Every last penny out of our audience when you got them doing it.
4805.04,4806.04, It's just not going to fly.
4806.04,4807.04, Right.
4807.04,4808.04, It sucks.
4808.04,4809.04, Right.
4809.04,4813.04," You know, I'm thinking that maybe this is a theory I've had to myself for the last few days."
4813.04,4817.04," My source has been very, very quiet about all the stuff lately."
4817.04,4818.04, Yep.
4818.04,4824.04," You know, we've actually, you know, ping them directly about doing a story on live arcade."
4824.04,4827.04," The windows, live arcade."
4827.04,4833.04," And just in general, since E3, they've been extremely quiet and post the steam community launching."
4833.04,4837.04, And I just wonder if they're like in a sort of a regrouping phase on the sold thing.
4837.04,4839.04, Like I just got to wonder if like all the bad.
4839.04,4841.04, He ought to be right.
4841.04,4846.04, You would hope they would be and it makes him wonder if they're going to come out with some big some new announcements.
4846.04,4847.04, Yeah.
4847.04,4849.04," Obviously, what they were trying didn't work."
4849.04,4850.04, Go as planned.
4850.04,4852.04, I think that's got to be happy to them.
4852.04,4855.04," And we still know that there's a break like even though, you know,"
4855.04,4858.04," Gears of War, of course, is because Microsoft first party game is going to use live."
4858.04,4860.04, U E 3 is not.
4860.04,4865.04," And I mean, that's really telling there when the company, when the developer, the same developer for both."
4865.04,4869.04," And when they're also announcing that they're shipping all the materials to include, you know,"
4869.04,4874.04," Gamestream does live support with U E 3 either engine with Unreal Engine 3,"
4874.04,4878.04," but then when, so not to confuse it with Unreal Tournament 3, which is come out and doesn't use it."
4878.04,4882.04," And like the the sense I got, you know, not to directly quote anyone, what, you know,"
4882.04,4887.04," and I asked, well, will this use support Gamestream does live as well was."
4888.04,4892.04," This is more let's just say, ha ha was equivalent of their response."
4892.04,4896.04," Yeah. And that's definitely that's not the kind of thing you're expecting to hear, you know,"
4896.04,4898.04, I don't think it's too late.
4898.04,4901.04, I don't think they've pulled it all the way.
4901.04,4904.04," And again, we brought this up before when steam came out."
4904.04,4908.04," It was, you know, universally regarded as just ridiculous train wreck."
4908.04,4910.04," You know, it was a totally turned around."
4910.04,4913.04, They turned it around now to point where we're saying the things we are.
4913.04,4918.04," I mean, remember going back to that first E 3 when Bill Gates was up there on stage showing it."
4918.04,4920.04," The whole audience was with Karen,"
4920.04,4924.04," you know, this is an audience full of fairly cynical people."
4924.04,4934.04, And he that demo that he gave of the of your PC and the 360ing or phone and whatever else I'll work in together was a really cool concept.
4934.04,4939.04," I mean, the executions been for shit so far, but the concept is definitely one that makes sense."
4939.04,4948.04, But I think it is an idea that plays more to the Xbox crowd than to the PC game or crowd who's always going to feel like they're having some amount of freedom taken away in the system.
4948.04,4949.04, Yeah.
4949.04,4955.04," You know, I think the idea is appeal to the Xbox people who are already in this totally closed system with a bunch of ridiculous shit out."
4955.04,4956.04, And anyway.
4956.04,4963.04," Yeah. And in the PC environment too, there are tons and tons of casual games available for free and for reduced cost."
4963.04,4968.04," And I mean, every month, you know, our free loader column helps point people to some of those things."
4968.04,4972.04," Each year we'll do 101 free games thing. I mean, so again, it's like,"
4972.04,4976.04, And that's always going to be the stuff that's going to be what's cool about PC anyways.
4976.04,4981.04," It's never going to be that man, you know what makes PC gaming great games for windows, you know, live."
4981.04,4982.04, You like that.
4982.04,4990.04," What's never, it's always going to be like the cool little studio is doing, you know, fun games that you just hear about from your friends that you download for free or five dollars."
4990.04,4997.04," And it's tough for them to get involved with something like that because the first is like, oh, no brainer put up a community section where people can submit games and stuff."
4997.04,5006.04," But they don't want that in the same way that YouTube ends up having the police everything that goes up and make sure it's like a hybrid material or offensive or, you know, against the law or something."
5006.04,5015.04," They don't want to put games that people can download that just like, you know, our viruses or that just run like crap and they mess up the works and stuff, you know,"
5015.04,5018.04," So there's to be quality control, but it would be good to see more."
5018.04,5026.04," It's like, I don't have the announced yet like, hey, here's some games made just by, you know, some kids in their, in their pajamas in their house, you know, like."
5027.04,5043.04," The only the only thing I've seen is that a GS wing game that they put on Xbox live, you know, that it was an internal like a bunch of interns that made this shooter using what is that what is their home gaming kit."
5043.04,5049.04," Exxon A XNA, yeah, and it was just this little game that these interns put together and they gave it away for free on."
5049.04,5050.04, That's cool.
5050.04,5055.04, I'd love to see way more that's more that kind of way less of like the $5 joust port.
5056.04,5067.04," Yeah, some, some stuff is great. No doubt. I mean, a pack man was worth the money, you know, don't force you to pay more than you want when you, I mean don't like I wanted Pac man and that's all I wanted."
5067.04,5074.04," I didn't want some JPEGs, you know, it's like, so let me get Pac man charge me that as much as it costs like steam like it's what's the big fucking deal."
5074.04,5081.04," You want a game, you just click it and you buy it. They don't try to pretend. No, it's fun bucks. It's like dollar for the more fun."
5082.04,5086.04," It's like, come on, dude. This isn't fucking itchy and scratchy when you know what I'm not a baby."
5086.04,5090.04," Yeah, it's okay. If it's, is it $8.99 is it $9.99?"
5090.04,5096.04," Well, I think early on they acted like there was going to be ways to get, you know, some of those bucks for free."
5096.04,5102.04," Like if you're, you know, if you've exhausted all the content in a game and you get a, hey, door fiss, that's your money."
5102.04,5108.04," That doesn't happen. Yeah, it doesn't happen. And, you know, it is way better on the PlayStation network to just be able to."
5109.04,5112.04," Oh, he plays the best real money. Yeah, it's not my nation's."
5112.04,5116.04," It doesn't even ask you to like buy points. It's just like, do you want to pay $5 for this?"
5116.04,5118.04, Nice. I have anything I stuff to hook up to.
5118.04,5120.04, We have to fill up what is it against the wallet.
5120.04,5122.04, We have to fill up the wallet first.
5122.04,5128.04," Oh, I guess, but it's like, it's like, you fill it with the, with the, with the exact amount that you're spending on the things."
5128.04,5131.04," That's a nebulous like, a colored balls."
5131.04,5135.04," I don't even feel like it's, it's psychologically works in their favor."
5135.04,5139.04," They're thinking, like, oh, well, maybe they'll think points doesn't mean like when I see pack of men."
5139.04,5141.04, It's like going to the point to like going shopping.
5141.04,5145.04," It's like a lot. Yeah, going shopping in another country."
5145.04,5148.04," Yeah, it's stupid. You get a wall full of this paper."
5148.04,5150.04, It's mine. You got to count full of these.
5150.04,5151.04, My name's.
5151.04,5152.04, Yeah.
5152.04,5153.04, Yeah.
5153.04,5154.04," All right, I just took my shoe off."
5154.04,5155.04, Is that a symbol?
5155.04,5156.04, I think that's a symbol.
5156.04,5157.04, How long was this one?
5157.04,5159.04," Oh, we're in half almost."
5159.04,5160.04, It's not long.
5160.04,5162.04, Minus the 45 we're going to cut out.
5162.04,5163.04, We're not cutting it out.
5165.04,5167.04, Is there any any other gaming?
5167.04,5171.04, I was just playing by your shot and inspired me to play half like two again.
5171.04,5173.04, That's my no. We're going to find game.
5173.04,5174.04, Start it over.
5174.04,5176.04, Got all the way to nobody prospect.
5176.04,5179.04, You buy this well weighted at this point because it seems pretty
5179.04,5184.04, Immanated they're going to announce that you know that you can download the version with the high-dynamic range.
5184.04,5186.04," Yeah, like, way to go."
5186.04,5187.04," Yeah, it's a super."
5187.04,5191.04," Yeah, I was kind of thinking that too."
5191.04,5194.04, Maybe I should wait for the prettier version.
5194.04,5196.04," Yeah, I wanted to play it this weekend."
5196.04,5197.04, That was heavy.
5197.04,5199.04, I just know it wasn't.
5199.04,5200.04, I wasn't.
5200.04,5201.04, I know I should.
5201.04,5202.04, You know what we didn't bring up.
5202.04,5203.04, I'll bring it up.
5203.04,5204.04, The news.
5204.04,5210.04, They came out this week that Ubisoft put a couple of their games up on file planet for free download.
5210.04,5211.04," Oh, yeah."
5211.04,5212.04," Oh, yes."
5212.04,5214.04, With in-game advertising.
5214.04,5217.04, So now you can go to fileplanet.com.
5217.04,5220.04," Not that I want to advertise for them, especially with their fucking 13 hour downloads."
5220.04,5230.04, But they're given away far cry one and Prince of Persia stands a time to really good game.
5230.04,5234.04, That's a good recent total free download you just have to deal with in-game abrog.
5234.04,5235.04," No, what is it?"
5235.04,5237.04, Are the handling and institutional game rules?
5237.04,5241.04," So, uh, is it interstitials between the levels?"
5241.04,5242.04, This I do not know.
5242.04,5244.04, This is the next diaper ointment on the back of the app.
5244.04,5246.04, I haven't confirmed it.
5247.04,5250.04, But what I heard is in-between levels.
5250.04,5254.04," Like when it loads you'll get an add instead of, you know, a loading screen or something like that."
5254.04,5257.04, It's not like you're walking around and you see billboards for that shit.
5257.04,5258.04," Oh, okay."
5258.04,5259.04, That's what I heard.
5259.04,5261.04, But I really cool if they crits neatly changed it.
5261.04,5262.04, That'd be awesome.
5262.04,5265.04, So that Prince of Persia was really about like saving a Toyota Yaris.
5265.04,5268.04, That was like on the very end.
5268.04,5269.04, We didn't try it.
5269.04,5270.04, What the appetite was going to be.
5270.04,5271.04," So, I can't wait."
5271.04,5273.04, There's a Toyota Yaris.
5273.04,5274.04, Is that what?
5274.04,5277.04, Is it an add on our podcast that like all I heard all I understood it was.
5277.04,5279.04, Yaris versus Yaris.
5279.04,5280.04, Yaris.
5280.04,5283.04," Yeah, no, they have adds all over San Francisco because it's supposed to be,"
5283.04,5289.04, I think it's supposed to be the thing to buy if you're young and you can't afford a pious or a pre-is.
5289.04,5290.04, A pious.
5290.04,5295.04," So it's like, you know, a young hip kind of gas mileage car."
5295.04,5297.04, It sounds like a pirate word.
5297.04,5298.04, Yaris.
5298.04,5299.04, Yeah.
5299.04,5301.04, What's that one sign that was like a car box?
5301.04,5302.04, Yeah.
5302.04,5305.04, What's that one model of sign on that looks like a lunch box?
5305.04,5308.04," Oh, the, uh, uh, get something X."
5308.04,5311.04, All the names are supposed to box you ones.
5311.04,5313.04," I like, I actually like that the box."
5313.04,5316.04," Whenever I said, I would, I wish that it was even more of a box."
5316.04,5318.04, I wish it had dangerous edges.
5318.04,5320.04," Like, what letters?"
5320.04,5321.04, Where we are?
5321.04,5322.04," Yeah, yeah."
5322.04,5325.04, I would kill for some of you that had no details at all.
5325.04,5328.04," This shit looks like it was designed and, uh, auto assault."
5328.04,5331.04," I, I like that though because I really, I don't know."
5331.04,5333.04, Cars got too curvy for me.
5333.04,5336.04," Like the, the touristification of car design."
5336.04,5338.04, Where everything like turned into a pregnant woman.
5338.04,5340.04," Well, they got curvy again, rather than."
5340.04,5344.04," Yeah, even because there was a big period in the 80s when everything went all,"
5344.04,5348.04," uh, wrecked a linear foot, uh, you want a pure pure."
5348.04,5350.04," No, I think it's even tacky the different."
5350.04,5351.04, These were things were curvy.
5351.04,5355.04," They had, they had edges too, you know, fans and so you're that exact guy."
5355.04,5358.04," I'm always in the car with my wife going, who would want one of those?"
5358.04,5359.04, So luckily.
5359.04,5360.04," Oh, Robert Ashley."
5360.04,5362.04," I would actually, I would."
5362.04,5364.04," He likes the, I like them."
5364.04,5365.04, But he would.
5365.04,5367.04," No, I don't care."
5367.04,5369.04," They got the new, the, the PT cruiser."
5369.04,5372.04, It looks like they shit like the rails from like a go cart track.
5372.04,5373.04, It did.
5373.04,5374.04, Ryan again.
5374.04,5375.04, Ryan again.
5375.04,5376.04, Let's point out.
5376.04,5377.04, Minutes later.
5377.04,5378.04, Still giving.
5378.04,5379.04, Let's wrap this shit up.
5379.04,5380.04, I got to go do shit.
5380.04,5382.04," This is like, when you have a slumber party or something,"
5382.04,5384.04," and, uh, you know, like, you're waiting."
5384.04,5386.04," Yeah, turn the lights off."
5386.04,5387.04," Like, all right, let's go to bed."
5387.04,5389.04," Right, just not three in the morning."
5389.04,5390.04," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
5390.04,5392.04," And you have that, and you have that conversation."
5392.04,5396.04," So I've been, if you guys ever had sex."
5396.04,5399.04," And then all the guys in the room go, yeah."
5399.04,5400.04, Should we hold our conversation?
5400.04,5405.04," We just, we, we've already established that because because it doesn't count,"
5405.04,5406.04, with words.
5406.04,5408.04," I meant, you know, and master chief too."
5408.04,5409.04, Yeah.
5409.04,5411.04, There you go.
5411.04,5412.04, You're brought a full circle.
5412.04,5413.04, There we go.
5413.04,5414.04, We have to match your keys.
5414.04,5415.04, So then we're done.
5415.04,5416.04, Where'd we circle?
5416.04,5417.04, Huh?
5417.04,5418.04, Football.
5418.04,5419.04, Football.
5419.04,5420.04, Good day.
