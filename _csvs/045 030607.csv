31.72,38.0, Today's podcast brought to you by the lens is going to be light because it's just a bad timing first of all
38.56,45.2, GDC the game developers conference starts this week and we went and registered today on our launch break got our passes
45.2,47.239999999999995, And we're gonna be doing that all week long
47.239999999999995,51.8, But just for the bad timing and this is that we record even though this is the March 6 GFW radio
51.8,56.559999999999995, We're recording it on Monday before the event so rather than be able to come back and tell you
57.36,61.26, What we thought of everything that we've seen the panels that we've been sitting in on what not
61.459999999999994,67.66, We're going to talk about the show beforehand and what it means and what it might be becoming and and different things like that
67.66,73.38, We would be disagree on some points here. So then after that we've got the usual here's the website
73.38,80.16, And got some good entries for that then we're going to talk a little bit about rumors
80.16,86.2, Put put them to rest about shadow run and the games for windows live gold addition and about the
86.72,87.92, The un
87.92,89.92, What would it be the case?
90.47999999999999,97.75999999999999, The unprecedented situation of having to pay to play online shooters on a PC platform
98.08,103.84, So we're gonna get to that and we've also got a round of what we're saving for the end of what you've been playing and
104.32,106.32, Darren we got to remind you too
106.32,110.36, He had to introduce himself with Darren's back now after two week break the news now married
110.55999999999999,115.3, How do you move and he's got some tails from New Zealand to share with you?
115.3,120.86," Yeah, I actually just really I'll make this really quick when it's more of a mini rants just an observation from when I was like wrapping up my vacation"
122.19999999999999,125.0, So I'm in the Auckland it's like the main the big city of
125.6,129.95999999999998, New Zealand kind of like New York or whatever and I'm just kicking back relaxing for a few minutes
129.95999999999998,134.9, I'm watching TV and there's an ad for you know like those little rubber sealant around a fridge
134.9,136.9," Okay, I'm actually going somewhere with you"
138.1,144.62," For it there's an ad for a guy who repairs that stuff okay, and it kind of and I'm like wow in America"
144.62,148.1, If there was like if like the rubber was starting to fall off that inside of the fridge
148.1,150.1, You chuck that shit out and get a new one right?
150.1,156.14000000000001," Okay, I mean, you know, but I mean like the good reaction of most people would be a crap my fridge is gone time to buy a brand new one"
156.14000000000001,159.34, That is the ice dispenser in the water and all right. They got the dude with the
159.98000000000002,161.98000000000002, Taco Bell caught gun
161.98,169.17999999999998," Pretty much out for a generator, but it's but it's like it's a gentle mentality of like they will work with whatever they can get and like make it work"
169.17999999999998,172.14, Is this all that guy did? Was that his job? That was his job and yeah
172.14,173.57999999999998, I mean he must have been making a pretty good living
173.57999999999998,178.78, I'm able to have an ad in like you know Auckland to do this but I guess what got me thinking was
179.82,185.66, Why is it that you know these guys have their shit together? They can like make anything they have work well
185.66,190.89999999999998, And even like you know computers like they don't need to upgrade as often because they just know how to tweak the hell out of that shit
191.46,193.46, So I was thinking
193.46,198.1," Maybe I need to do more of that in the magazine maybe tips on the podcast whatever, but more importantly"
198.1,201.70000000000002, I kind of want to get my driver on your shit seriously how to get properly my guy for ownership
202.42000000000002,207.36," Clever bands seriously like you know macaroni noodles whatever, but I mean I guess ultimately though"
207.36,211.14000000000001, What I was thinking is I need to start throwing us some deadlines to like you know the hardware guys out there
211.14000000000001,214.34, So like the X10 you got one generation. I show me which the hell you can do
215.02,218.38, All this is because of dude. We'll fix the
218.38,220.38, That's what I said
220.38,221.98, My mind went this whole other weird direction
221.98,223.98, That's there's a zealem can do attitude
223.98,226.68," Yeah, there's a very name for the syndrome though. It's like you go to a country"
226.88,233.34, You'd never bed before and it's like you walk in you get off the plane and you don't notice like all the dudes like the cannibals eating
234.18,238.85999999999999, Eating other people for like and they can't and they're making these great rugs and you're like you know
238.85999999999999,242.01999999999998, They just have it. They have a sense for for for artistry
242.01999999999998,244.85999999999999," They'll be lost in our in our culture. No, but they they're we just"
245.82000000000002,251.42000000000002," We need to bring that back. Well, no, it's a big part of their culture is kind of recycling and reusing and just kind of making making"
251.42000000000002,255.82000000000002, Shit work out of stuff you wouldn't expect like taking a walk and turning it into a satellite dish or something
255.82000000000002,259.82, I don't know but it's just got that we got what do we have here? We've got I've seen
260.38,263.42, Case mods and shit have seen people take like a quick number real doll
263.82,265.82, Something that people might need Google
266.38,271.5," Turn it turn it. Oh, yeah, yeah, I see that one. Yeah, need the Google it right like that really need that sign that don't type it there"
271.66,273.94," Well, but I mean I guess things like we don't see enough of that though"
273.94,276.5, What I'm saying we need more that real doll
276.5,277.5, Need more real doll
277.5,279.5," No, I guess what actually was in"
279.9,283.5, When we were computer gaming world that was enough we featured that
283.5,286.14," Yeah, that was the the section called public access"
286.14,291.1," That's right. There was the the toilet bowl PC and stuff like yeah, but I think it's flash over on"
291.1,297.06, But I think more to the point is like do we really need a hard resolution for everything is what I'm saying like do it will we really need a physics card
297.58,299.58, We know which
299.58,305.78, You know depends on your definition of need exactly so I mean I'm just saying like I guess you really need these computer games
305.78,306.78, We play there
306.78,312.06," Yes, we do that. Okay, if this is the opportunity to do it something that I've been wanting to write about quickly"
312.06,316.97999999999996, And during you're helping me we figured out I got a you know an Nvidia 80 100 GTX card
316.97999999999996,321.65999999999997," Oh, you can't fit it in your machine. I can fit in the machine the deal it at Jeff went through the same thing we had you know"
322.34,324.7," The stupid jokes about oh, it's still being oh"
324.7,335.46," Yeah, but the thing was it amazed me is because this case is enormous. Yeah, it's like when I says like Andre the giant shoe box or something"
335.46,336.9, And I can't fit a video card
336.9,341.21999999999997, You know it's really weird because the structure is some of the cases. So when I get the one you have that you're using
341.21999999999997,344.82," It's like the whole back end of it you figure okay, you could fit anything that soccer"
344.82,347.7, But it's got the grid for the right hard drive stuff
347.7,351.7, So the thing that just bugs me is like you know at what point I mean with a case
351.7,355.82, So the other board manufacturers and the card manufacturers just at least meet and say hey
355.94,363.18, Let's project you know up until 2010 we're gonna greet a fit things within these dimensions on the upper end or something because it's like every
363.18,368.41999999999996," Don't we celebrate the modularity of PC. Oh, you don't have to you don't have to go and buy new PC"
368.41999999999996,370.21999999999997, All you gotta do is get yourself another video card
371.21999999999997,373.21999999999997, Like now this shit fits is compatible
374.46,379.53999999999996," So like you're actually right in a card. No, I need a new case for one. You need a new motherboard for that. Oh, no"
379.54,386.14000000000004," I need you know, it turns out you need everything else got like completely redone just because they added a 16th of an inch too much to the card"
386.34000000000003,390.74, Without looking and seeing that there's like one out of like the billion varieties of
391.66,394.86, Box models on the shelves that will accommodate there right now
394.86,398.06, There there there there there are there are some standards. I mean there are except the standards
398.06,404.46000000000004, But it's just it just blows my mind that you make a graphics card so like honking big that it's not gonna even fit most tower cases
405.46000000000004,408.18," Yeah, so I just needed it right. No, no, no"
408.18,412.82, That's totally it's really pissed me off. I think I didn't really this and that patty right like what if you yeah
413.38,417.3," Yeah, I mean imagine like the like the joy you just dropped 600 bones on this graphics card and you're like"
417.3,420.5," Oh crap, it's gonna do everything and then you and you you try to plug it in you're like"
421.3,423.3, Thank you
423.3,428.06, You're 60 and then it's like what you do am I gonna get another case and then I'm gonna get in
428.06,434.5, Other board or am I just gonna take the card back and then scale down to the GSX right just what we're doing
434.5,438.26," GTS yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what's making up name acronym"
438.26,445.94," Go ahead go for it the QBT yeah, the SB day whatever. Yeah, okay, so GDC is coming up"
446.98,451.86, And I would I'm actually I'll let a I'll want to remember raise the discussion here. I'm gonna read directly
451.86,453.46, It was
453.46,458.58, Posture Liberty cabbage no mocking boys for the reading of this cuz straight up. I think this guy is like
459.21999999999997,461.53999999999996, Point he's awesome next level shit
463.14,464.82, Elevator
464.82,470.34, With what Liberty cabbage has to say and that is as follows. I think on the whole there's too much coverage of these events
470.97999999999996,476.65999999999997, Seems like every other week. There's some kind of game related press junk at TGS XO6 GDC E3 CES
477.21999999999997,481.94, And so on and I can understand why some of the developers may have given the press a cold shoulder at this one in the past
482.5,487.38, I bet they need a convention where they can spend their time talking shop learning new technologies and not organizing
487.38,494.1, Interviews in big production boosts and announcing products and since E3 is gone it looks like a lot of people are expecting GDC to fill its gap
494.42,495.94, I get the feeling
495.94,501.78, The E3 collapse primarily because it became too big with the public for its own good and probably a waste of time for some companies
502.02,506.1, Why show off something half-fandish and get some bad press that kills public interest in your product?
506.5,512.82, Also anybody in their dog can get into E3 so the company's probably had to waste time and money talking to people who had no real purpose being there
513.7800000000001,519.38, So the point about where I do agree with Liberty Cali and I was wanting well I agree with them in that it's it's a concern
519.38,521.62, I was wondering in in the weeks
521.86,524.58, leading up to this year's GDC
524.58,526.98, I've seen far more activity in every sector
526.98,531.46, I mean not just my email inbox and in a point people requesting appointments to show me things
532.0200000000001,538.4200000000001, Where in the past GDC as a matter of you get the schedule you look at the panels and discussions and and you select which you'd like to attend
538.74,540.4200000000001, And now you're getting all these you know
540.5,544.9, Please come and show us and you know a lot of press releases with a lot of far too many exclamation
544.9,548.74, You know points in them and and then online as well you're seeing
549.62,554.9, Far more threads and activity and discussions you know what's what are the big predictions who's announcing what and
555.4599999999999,557.38, I mean there and you've been going to GDC a lot longer
557.38,562.42, And I have so you could tell me I mean how how long it's been the case that big announcements have been made there and
562.5,564.5, And big revelations have occurred there but
565.06,567.06, Of all the years that I've been going
567.06,569.06, You know not so much it's it doesn't
569.14,574.02," Well, I think how it just right when he's saying that this isn't event for developers, you know it absolutely is you know"
574.02,578.66, Actually there have been a couple surprises in the past I mean like even late. It's kind of like the stuff that you don't really expect
578.66,580.66, They first showed off the unreal three engine there years ago
581.3,585.8599999999999," That's true. Yeah, we'll write first and out sport there right a total surprise announcement"
586.9799999999999,588.66, I think I mean to be honest with you
588.9799999999999,594.9, It is about the developers the GDC and I think that's what's so cool about it and I and the guys who run GDC
595.3,601.4599999999999, Want to keep it that way they've been very militantly saying they don't want this to become any E3 and just to talk to one of other
601.62,602.98, Liberty cabbages that it
602.98,609.14," Liberty cabbages, you know it I got to say yeah, it's you're right guy guy gal whoever Liberty you got some awesome points there and"
609.78,613.3," One thing actually I just want to like bring up and take it too far off topic, but I"
614.02,619.22, Think that when you see all these websites and magazines just have their GDC xo6 E3
619.22,621.22, But that's lazy reporting
621.3000000000001,627.86," Honestly, I don't want to see a report about a convention or some kind of line show if there's something cool that comes out of it"
627.86,631.86," Sure, do a story, but don't like do some like lame rapper story just alike"
632.4200000000001,636.9, But the more I think the concern I mean we know that the people that that are responsible for putting
637.3000000000001,642.6600000000001, The cub the convention together or the conference together have stated that they don't want it to become the other thing
643.0600000000001,648.5," But I'm wondering to what extent that's in their control right one. Yeah, the Sean talk about it"
648.58,654.18, He was noting earlier just how many and silly are you things are happening where in the hotels in the area and across the
654.18,656.42, Right one of the things notices that a lot of the
656.9,659.94, Coventus press events that they're staging where they want us to come see their demos
659.94,665.06," Yeah, not at the show proper they're at the hotels around it right that's been happening for a long time"
665.06,670.26," Oh, so is it yeah, it's been happening to this degree because it just seems like I agree with Sean it just seems like this year"
670.26,675.94," No, I mean, I agree I agree with you. I mean, and then San Jose. Yeah, I mean, I remember going and seeing you know"
675.94,680.34, Different like you may sniff and I wouldn't saw that bad boy
680.4200000000001,685.22," It the hotel across from the San Jose convention center, but I think but to this extent yeah"
685.22,689.86, I think in the past it's been a lot of like the the lesser games that you really wouldn't have heard of otherwise
689.86,695.22, It's like the hungry developers want to get their stuff out there like I first saw field ops last year at GDC
695.7,698.4200000000001, And I met somebody in a hotel room and
699.0600000000001,701.0600000000001, Things happen
701.06,703.06, But
703.8599999999999,707.14, Field ops maybe they just shouldn't allow press at GDC
707.54,713.66, That's that's what I was actually gonna say because here's the thing for one if you allow press in and in today's age
713.66,715.66, We're press is increasingly
715.9399999999999,721.2199999999999," Not so much a matter of a pen and a notebook, but also video cameras and recording devices of all sorts"
721.4599999999999,727.54, That once you put them in then whatever you're showing becomes a public matter as it were
727.6999999999999,731.2199999999999," Yeah, so then what happens and you know when I was a you know a couple weeks ago"
731.2199999999999,735.74, And I was talking to Mitch Gittem and from a bass a making he's making shadow run
735.74,737.9399999999999, Which we're gonna talk about again later today
738.4599999999999,742.42," He was complaining and this is old news now, but when they first showed his game at E3"
742.8199999999999,746.42, He felt that it didn't get a fair shake because they were developing it in a way that
746.74,751.3399999999999, Games ought to be developed in is that were you focus on the content and the gameplay and the deep
751.9,755.38, Structures of the game and then you throw the dread the trappings on later on
755.54,758.82," But because of it the game with very mundane, you know, very dread"
758.98,762.9399999999999," But everyone had written it office like okay, here's some generic shit, you know"
763.1,767.9399999999999, So because here's what I'm thinking I was if you get if you know if you're showing your game in any way shape
767.9399999999999,772.98, Performing you know the presses there you might at that point you've invited the entire world in and the world is gonna be making
772.98,778.7, They're it's gonna be coming to those conclusions prematurely and unfairly and you're just creating this this
778.9,782.22, Unificial pressure for if you are gonna show something and the press is gonna be there
782.22,787.86, Which also means that entire world's looking at it you get right back into the whole E3 trap where you're you're
787.86,793.0600000000001, You're putting the trappings on this stuff before you you ought to be right and you're trying to make it
793.0600000000001,799.46, Presentable to the public who's not necessarily aware tuned into the way that the nature of game development production right
799.46,802.98, I think it's kind of I totally agree with you on this and
803.1800000000001,806.3000000000001, You know some of the companies use the same process like epic for example
806.8199999999999,812.78, They do the same like you know basically build the game around it gameplay first around chicken wire and then kind of add the graphics on later
812.78,817.02, And I they definitely got an unfair shake last year because
817.78,820.9399999999999, It's I mean everyone forgot these guys actually have a pretty good track record too
821.26,825.38," They do the crimson skies games and make warrior games. Yeah, totally so it's like you know"
825.38,830.9799999999999," Give me like give me a freaking break and that's the yeah, and that's the whole the whole concern with this and"
831.6999999999999,835.14, And then once you do I think the other thing too is that because of it
835.14,837.14, You have
837.14,842.74, With with increased importance of websites in the press covering things and and it's a day to day need instead of us
842.74,850.66, Where it's like the cell certain number of magazines and subscriptions on a monthly basis we have the day to day need to have people visiting your site and clicking on your links and stuff
850.66,853.86, You want big sensational stories so
854.58,861.92, You know GDC has done an excellent job of covering itself in the past and that you can go to like a gun or suture something or there are all these places where you can go and
862.2,864.4399999999999, Get word for word transcripts and recordings
865.14,869.52, Of you know the proceedings there so you want to hear about something it's you can virtually be there
869.52,872.04, But now you're gonna see all these places and every day
872.04,874.98, They're gonna want to put up a million stories and they're gonna want you to click on them
874.98,878.58," And it's like they're gonna want them to seem I mean, are they gonna want I don't know I mean"
878.58,880.42, They're gonna how are they gonna sexist stuff up?
880.42,886.5, I mean sometimes it's really really dry. I mean if it says it's an AI demo on you know on company heroes and stuff
886.5,889.0, It's not a lay person discussion
889.0,894.3, It's a high level of the work on AI and you go in and you're not gonna hear like okay
894.3,897.66, Did you see this guy just jumped over that wall and he just dug a ditch and dug that you know
897.66,898.92, Huckered down in there
898.92,902.3399999999999, It's all true grenade in and throw it back out. I mean you're not hearing that you're hearing like
902.6999999999999,906.2199999999999," 1 plus 1 is 5 and 5 plus 5 is 6 and that's a bad math, but"
907.6999999999999,909.42, It was a burp to help to see that
909.42,914.14," It's about yeah, but anyway, so you're gonna go in your you're basically gonna get some what it would is"
914.66,918.8199999999999, Depending on who you are and you know your perspective is not innocent some just wondering
919.4599999999999,921.4599999999999, I don't know
921.46,923.74, I'm wondering will people really care about every single panel
923.74,928.98, They're caring you know they're gonna get it wrong or they're gonna be inclined to make a bigger stink about things than they then necessarily
928.98,934.02," Are I mean if it's if it's just palettes like hey, here's the AI that's implemented in the game as you know it"
934.02,939.0600000000001, Here's how it worked and instead you get like oh well here's this rad new thing and I don't know
939.0600000000001,942.1800000000001," I just like I left field now, but no, I don't know"
942.1800000000001,947.22," I think it was the one plus one equals five stuff that got me into this the deep world. Well in no, but I"
947.74,949.74, I
950.14,954.14," Ryan is just has his look a shell shock. Yeah, are you fixing your wires again there by the way?"
954.78,956.78," Oh, see now"
957.26,961.5," So yeah, what you guys think about well? I mean I use for my own personal experience"
961.5,967.1800000000001, I went to one of the Microsoft meltdowns that they're kind of line show kind of big news event last last summer
967.1800000000001,970.5600000000001, And they're talking about the info for DX. It was a fishy rolled out and I
970.8,976.28," Mean I I'm I got a good handle on some of that stuff, but like when I was said and that when I set my S down"
976.28,978.5999999999999, It's like guy opened his mouth and once and zeroes came out
978.5999999999999,983.16, I was like what the hell is he saying and that's crazy. It's just it's got its place. It's just right
983.16,985.8, It's got its audience. That's for sure. We need to be there
985.8,992.42, What in the past at past GECs? I mean we've often kind of showed our shoulders and said like and there's not really much
992.88,996.5999999999999," Here for us. Well, I think the trick no, I think the trick is finding those cool things that are there"
996.5999999999999,999.92, I mean like right I mean it's it's a less immediate sense like
999.92,1007.3199999999999," Like we go and we're looking to see okay, maybe patterns emerge. Maybe it turns out that that out of like six panels"
1008.1999999999999,1013.04, Three key people were like in a roundabout way very interested in the same issues
1013.04,1019.56, And we're able to say okay for the going ahead for the year these seem to be we know that like this is an important issue to this guy
1019.56,1022.8399999999999, Or to this girl and and that these are all you know we kind of like
1023.4399999999999,1027.32, Sort of take the going there and get the other brahmeter of what ever what's going on
1027.32,1030.12, But we don't go in there to go and turn that into a
1030.8,1033.56, Story that day or that very month or right
1033.56,1037.4399999999998, Probably the web shotgun reporting you don't get a chance to sit that and analyze it
1037.4399999999998,1041.12, You know it's kind of like or in print too. I mean I don't want to like slim the the web stuff
1041.12,1045.1599999999999, I mean even even if you went and said and you had a very good analysis of what you had just seen
1045.72,1049.28, Like what I mean what are you getting from that unless you're really editorializing it
1049.28,1055.12, And I think to do that fairly you need to be paying a great deal of attention and also just or like maybe if people are doing stories
1055.12,1059.6, Where they're attending a number of these things and they're doing what I was just saying where you're you're looking at him and you're saying
1059.6,1066.32," Okay, maybe these these these theme seem to emerge maybe these are you know looking at this and if and so far as we can"
1066.84,1070.4799999999998, Make any claims about the state of the nation based on what we've seen and heard
1070.7199999999998,1073.2399999999998, Then we'll do that here. I mean I think that stuff could be cool
1073.2399999999998,1076.1999999999998, But if we're just getting a bunch of regurgitation of what's already going on
1076.7199999999998,1082.7199999999998, It's kind of like when I don't know like a company gives you a demo and it's available to us like a beta
1082.72,1086.1200000000001, It's public but only do a certain number of people and they go on reforms and they just mainly
1086.1200000000001,1090.64, They just want to brag that they were there and that they got to play it and so you just there's this
1090.64,1094.04, Like total redundancy and everyone's just saying the same thing that like okay
1094.04,1098.48, We'll do the character now has a yellow and a blue model and you can choose between them or whatever
1099.1200000000001,1101.1200000000001, Sheet yellow and blue
1101.1200000000001,1103.1200000000001, Awesome
1103.1200000000001,1105.1200000000001, That come from
1105.1200000000001,1107.1200000000001, Shit out my ass
1107.1200000000001,1112.32," Oh, yeah, I think most people are just not used to eat three nine existing yet"
1112.32,1115.04," Yeah, there's that whole question. We were like where is it gonna go?"
1115.32,1120.9199999999998, It's that whole phenomenon still got I migraed somewhere because I don't think it's not gonna happen
1120.9199999999998,1124.96, It's basically it's a need without a home right now. Are they still calling like the
1125.08,1127.08, Sergant fort now for everyone?
1127.08,1131.24," No, no, well that's the gate. That's the IDG thing the game pro whatever that calling it"
1131.24,1134.6799999999998," That's a crazy. Yes, name like that's a good name for a rave not so far"
1135.9199999999998,1140.84," That's so much for a game conference. It was nothing voted amongst everyone. Oh, yes. Oh my god"
1141.08,1143.08, Love you guys
1143.08,1151.28, So it users voted for that as the name of the convention or they submitted it and someone voted on also known as some what's your favorite color
1152.24,1154.8799999999999, It looks interesting anyone who voted for that. He's like the internet
1154.8799999999999,1159.4399999999998, They need to tag them and release them back into the wild so we can like find out where they reproduce and what they actually do
1159.4399999999998,1165.76," One of the databases, but and then there's that one that new e3. Oh, yeah, the new I don't think they even know if something's gonna be"
1165.76,1172.32, And nobody's really sure what that is yet and then then there's the publisher by publisher stuff that's gonna happen
1172.32,1176.48, Where you're going to have these events online that you know where Liberty Cavalry was talking about the
1177.16,1182.24," E3 XO 6 TGSE. Yeah, those are all the big ones instead you're gonna have like you have these like no"
1182.64,1186.08, She's lint someone hates courtesy of publisher
1186.96,1191.08," Right, yeah, I'm like the controlled expert like the things the thing's the smart morning"
1191.08,1193.08, He knows whatever
1193.76,1197.32," You're making a van at them all this no, but like things like that's exactly what it's talking"
1197.32,1201.0, Like the kind of stuff. It just been lazy reporting the pisses me off you go to like some kind of line show to see
1201.56,1207.8799999999999, Every game of publisher makes and you have to and get the line up all the interviews against a backdrop with the company logo behind it
1208.1999999999998,1210.1999999999998, Those ones worry me in a way because like
1210.9199999999998,1216.96, In those situations they don't have to necessarily drag out the big boys that you would want to be seeing because you're gonna be there anyway
1216.96,1219.1599999999999, So and a lot like especially
1219.16,1224.68," These are kids we're all in this area, but like I mean like if a company holds one of those out here and they're flying people out from around the world"
1224.68,1228.68, And they've already committed to you know say you're you work for a website and
1229.0800000000002,1231.28, Germany or whatever and you've already sent someone out here
1231.4,1234.52, It's like you're gonna write about whatever. I already got you here
1234.52,1238.3600000000001," So like if the company you let's say the company is yay, or not gonna slam them, but then"
1238.92,1243.28," They're not gonna be showing spore on crisis there, but once they got you out they're gonna be breaking out"
1243.28,1246.24, You know Superman DS or something that they just announced and
1246.24,1248.24, In the you know
1248.68,1252.96," Whatever, so you know that kind of kind of stuff right. It's good as the movie was that actually happened"
1252.96,1254.72, I mean that that was supposed to be a hypothetical
1256.96,1263.38, Where we went and they did have the big announcement where you saw team fortress two and that was that was pretty cool
1263.52,1265.52, But they didn't have
1265.52,1268.56," Before but they didn't have yeah, I mean that stuff there"
1268.56,1270.96, They felt like their kids that children like
1270.96,1276.08, They had like they had seems to pets would like a dog trainer doing kiss with their dogs
1276.08,1278.96," I would see that but I would really love it. Well, not just"
1280.4,1283.2," Just say again, not to slam any actually other companies did this too"
1283.2,1287.44, It's like they'll they'll bring it out make you burn a whole day just checking out all this stuff or half a day
1287.44,1291.3600000000001," Whatever, yeah, every company and they're gonna be doing more more and then they say"
1292.32,1296.0, We're here's here's a trailer if you want to actually see the game in motion you got to come by our booth
1296.4,1300.8, But the thing is what booth are they gonna do that for now? I'm gonna make us do that for GDC this week
1300.8,1306.6399999999999, Are they gonna pull that like with the new E3 is it gonna be one of like digital life in New York
1308.1599999999999,1311.28, I don't know and that's the big questions problem gonna be a big shot
1311.28,1314.24," I'm less of different events. Yeah, I think this next year over these events"
1314.24,1318.24, I bet you mark my words figure it out. I bet stuff like Pani arcade's gonna blow up even further
1318.24,1322.24," I mean like this past year was pretty good, but like I can imagine that like getting like way out of control"
1322.8,1326.24, What's around about the branding is like like another one Atari universe these one
1327.04,1328.32, Like a name and name
1329.28,1334.96, What is like you see like you see stories about can we went to Atari University and you're like that's the whole headline
1334.96,1339.28, I don't even like oh a Atari is going to be gotten into education
1339.28,1343.28," No, that's right. No, that's just in the name for their press event. They name that to like you"
1343.28,1348.8799999999999, Be able to get you like to come out and and learn like croissants and play plays some games
1349.6,1353.6," Yeah, you just go post the story like verbate it. Yeah, so we're down here"
1353.6,1357.9199999999998," Sorry, you're a steam man. Yeah, apparently the universe is located so good"
1359.04,1362.24, And you affect diploma as you leave with the jackar and the game just
1362.24,1366.1599999999999, And apparently the curriculum is all on the beach and like kind of cobbo or something
1366.8799999999999,1369.28," Whatever, I'm gonna get you once it's fun. We"
1369.76,1371.76, So you you guys have any yeah
1372.08,1376.3999999999999, Close and comments on and concerns for GDC before we go. I mean next when we come back next week
1376.3999999999999,1378.8799999999999, We'll have attended all these things and we'll have a
1379.3600000000001,1381.3600000000001, deal to talk about and
1381.3600000000001,1385.44," But anything else going into it. I mean, this is gonna be late sucks. It's gonna go tomorrow"
1385.44,1388.0, It's gonna start already looking at the stories that we
1388.72,1390.5600000000002, We're just gonna be better on the
1390.5600000000002,1395.2800000000002," Yeah, the other one then the only thing I was gonna say is just please guys and guys in charge of GDC"
1395.7600000000002,1397.7600000000002," Jamil, Dan, you guys"
1398.0,1400.24, Stay true don't start don't let it become any three
1400.5600000000002,1405.68, Keep it the truth keep it a stupid true school about the peoples about the developers because that's what the show is true school
1405.8400000000001,1407.68, True school keep it keep it true school
1407.68,1410.0800000000002," Okay, so true. It's up to the hotel managers too"
1410.72,1413.04," Oh man, that's right. There's no"
1413.44,1415.52, Like in the past it was actually kind of cool in the past
1416.0,1419.68, It was more like a social gathering like after hours everyone needed the fair amount and San Jose
1419.8400000000001,1425.28," Right, yeah, what's the new designated that's the problem? There's no there's no huge area where everyone can kind of gather"
1425.8400000000001,1430.5600000000002," Balkanize to all these parties, you know exactly say so it is kind of becoming an E3 and that respect"
1430.72,1435.2, That's the other good thing about you sure we're talking about you you go to these and then you get like everyone
1435.76,1440.3200000000002, Saw stuff a bit and they got loose lips and it's not that they're telling you what their what their next project is
1440.3200000000002,1445.04, But but you get them talking what what's what's bugging in the game. Oh totally. Yeah. What is it about yeah? Your job that's
1445.68,1450.0800000000002, That's a pain in your ass right now or what what what's gonna be the big stuff just next year
1450.0800000000002,1454.48," We'll feel our trade secrets. Yeah, I'm sure bullies truth serum. Okay, so"
1455.04,1459.52, Moving on we're gonna I think it's good time now is this good at time? Is any to talk about the heroes of the web?
1459.52,1464.72," Ah, good. It's our weekly segment. Is this a new thing? This is a new there. It's basically just"
1465.44,1471.6, Loving leading loving dramatic reading of some of the finest specimens of internet posting
1471.6,1475.44," Well, if you know we need some kind of proper like intro for there's like heroes of the internet"
1476.0,1479.68," That'll do that okay, done so I'll copy that and everything up"
1479.68,1484.72," This is been a trend where like okay whiskey nerd. This is like also new too, Darren since you've been"
1486.0,1488.8799999999999, I've very she's got a fitting for whiskey. So don't character the whiskey nerd
1489.84,1498.48, And he's good for a certain type of a certain type of online dentism and such as rock steady 33 who originally posted this on the gaming
1498.48,1504.8799999999999," You know, is he a break dancer? I don't know. I don't I'm not sure I think he's just a bit under"
1506.16,1508.16, Okay
1508.16,1511.28, A couple days ago I picked up Tetris DS again
1511.28,1513.68, He's covered online play and I just love
1513.8400000000001,1519.28, Wooping kid ass is all day and it not play those Japanese people and get my ass whipped all day
1520.0,1524.4, Basically I've been playing for at least two to three hours a day and I'm hooked all over again
1524.4,1526.4, Despite the shady unlimited turn move
1526.8,1529.1200000000001, Of course I succumb to the Tetris syndrome
1529.44,1534.4, Or I see Tetris blocks everywhere and it's embarrassing but I know I'm not the only one that's happened to
1535.44,1539.6000000000001," So anyway, well, I was watching the movie with the lady friend of mine last night"
1540.4,1542.4, That would be Captain Ron for those you were
1543.68,1547.3600000000001, You started getting a little touchy feeling because Captain Ron inspires
1548.24,1550.48," Anyway, like it's a"
1550.48,1552.8, Like you go like it in a web post near a lady friend
1553.8400000000001,1559.2, Like that's the those like dude she think I'm guy. I'll lady friend. That's like with my girlfriend
1560.48,1562.48, That's the
1562.48,1564.48, Something off guys put it
1564.48,1567.8400000000001," Oh, so Captain Ron let me get back in now broke character man"
1567.8400000000001,1569.8400000000001," Okay, what's getting so anyway"
1569.84,1574.6399999999999, I was watching a movie with the lady friend of mine last night Captain Ron for those of you who are interesting
1574.72,1579.52, We started getting a little touchy feeling after a couple more shots of Kirkov vodka
1579.52,1582.32, That's $12 a handle I keep it fucking classy
1583.36,1586.0, And some make-out sessions we went to the bathroom
1586.9599999999998,1589.76, We know it we were having sex on the bathroom floor
1590.24,1593.9199999999998, Get the only goddamn thing I could do was stare at the bathroom tiles
1593.92,1600.0, It's easy squares and look exactly like Tetris pieces and envision putting the pieces together
1600.5600000000002,1602.5600000000002, I got so distracted I had to stop
1602.5600000000002,1607.68, I couldn't tell her the truth so I just cleaned I had a mess whiskey deck and she eventually went home
1609.2,1611.2, Now
1611.76,1615.28, So thanks to this reading I now have a vision of like some dilution to Johnny Cash that said
1615.8400000000001,1617.52, That said we've got a response right here
1618.5600000000002,1620.88," I'll get a key okay, excellent, actually"
1620.96,1626.24, Says Revenant Kilku he's not indignant this time he chimed his antis this is a kinsured soul
1627.5200000000002,1629.5200000000002, Kinsured soul says
1629.5200000000002,1637.3600000000001, Sometimes when I wake up in the night to take a shit if I'm really tired my mind will be influenced by what I was playing before
1637.3600000000001,1639.3600000000001, I was playing
1639.3600000000001,1646.24, Gabriel Mario Q and I sat on the toilet thinking I don't have enough that Peter think this shit
1646.32,1654.24, So I don't want to work with Mario if you haven't turned the podcast off yet
1654.72,1656.72, This is really surprised it's gonna go
1658.0,1660.96, All direct quotes those were not that was not me
1661.76,1664.0, That was not any member of this podcast
1664.72,1669.68," These are real things that we found out there in the real heroes yeah, you start to real hear me"
1669.68,1671.68, American hero
1672.4,1675.1200000000001, I don't know if you guys want to comment on that more but like the guy is
1676.16,1678.88, I mean what's really you can say that's like that you're just like
1679.8400000000001,1684.0800000000002, That's like all or something you know like it's a meditation a bit's also like the
1684.8,1689.28, Just the lost corridor something can you do can you know can you do the cricket sound effect
1690.4,1692.64, As the Michael wins low bar podcast can you actually do that?
1693.2,1696.4," That's my feelings. I mean, yeah, I can't but I'm gonna fail now that the pressure's on"
1696.64,1698.64," Oh, yeah"
1698.64,1702.0800000000002, I'm too dry if I do in the whiskey dirt thing and I have to get a drink
1706.0,1708.0, I'm I
1708.3200000000002,1713.44, That would be the best most of most appropriate for the folks trying to imitate your nodules are big
1713.44,1719.92," For good good. Yeah, okay, wow well, you know I've had I've had dreams about games I've been playing too much"
1721.2,1723.2, Does it go beyond that no
1723.6000000000001,1729.1200000000001, Like some of you have you ever did that ever happen to you bad and that dude just wants to tension or something and maybe people pointed out
1729.1200000000001,1731.1200000000001, I guess there's an ad for that axe
1731.6000000000001,1736.64," Body spray yeah, it's like a it's not really a piece of terminals. It's called a something shower"
1737.68,1741.28, Our south of the border neighbor shower like like when you just like that
1741.28,1745.28, I heard a lot of people you know like you know like
1745.28,1747.3600000000001, I get in the shower and a bottle of freeze
1749.3600000000001,1752.0, It's like that's what I think I thought of a breeze
1753.2,1755.2, So
1755.2,1757.2, Like
1757.2,1762.16," Tied in my underwear, so they had it and where it was like a Tetris piece sort of fabric looking on the bottom in"
1762.16,1766.72," Like the space and majors type scenario, but then a bunch of like you shape pieces falling down"
1766.72,1770.8, But they were tons of them. They were all going right. It was a perfect fit for the the dog looking
1771.44,1775.68," You need down on the bottom, but I was wondering if it was that like if he saw that and thought he was gonna be clever"
1776.56,1778.56, I like make a story out the actual story
1779.04,1784.08, But it seems to go on and he talked about how like the next night. I mean people helped him and give him advice in the next
1784.08,1786.72, Nighty set he was able to copy late without envisioning the
1787.28,1789.28, Pieces from this
1789.28,1792.8799999999999, So he was playing bubble bubble for that night before houses. That was another tip. Yeah
1795.04,1797.04, So now Ryan that you feel good knockward
1799.12,1802.24, We're ready to keep your hands above the table Ryan ready to move this join on
1802.6399999999999,1806.72," You take a break before we do that. Oh really? Yeah, that's what that's what you spin in your fingers"
1806.8,1808.8, That's what that was
1809.44,1810.8, All right let's take a break all right
1813.52,1819.52, Can't get enough of deal dot TV then download our podcast just go to deal dot TV and click on the audio link
1819.52,1825.2, Turn the moves you'll be able to listen to Patrick Robert and the rest of the gang over and over and over again
1825.52,1829.6000000000001, Over to keep here canal clean and don't share if you don't want to risk bread in disease
1832.08,1834.08, And we're back
1835.04,1839.52, After the rat break and as promised we are going to discuss
1840.24,1843.84, What we've been playing and this is one more thing to go wrong because
1844.3999999999999,1847.6, Horribly horribly wrong because it's been a lot of non PC stuff
1847.9199999999998,1854.32," Yeah, I all around it's just been one of those weeks. I mean we're like once in a while we'll do these and people get on the message boards and"
1854.8799999999999,1857.36, Like I thought you would to be the PC
1858.72,1862.6399999999999, Podcasts the game through windows why I can why you talking about an Xbox game
1862.72,1864.72, When I said that one PC game
1864.88,1871.3600000000001," So message board poster that is you yeah, and it's just like hey, you know some but it varies week by week"
1871.3600000000001,1874.64, I think a lot of us here would be playing we've got our reasons for not
1875.1200000000001,1876.4, been you know
1876.4,1881.3600000000001, Balls deep in supreme commander yet other than that. I'm still messing with that computer in the video card thing
1882.16,1885.6000000000001, And I know we all played the demo for command and conquer three
1886.16,1889.3600000000001," Well, suffragetes you were gone have but the rest of us did so how you guys liking it?"
1890.0,1896.7199999999998, It's cool. I mean for it's very old school. It's very old school and and doesn't have the FMV clips in the demo
1896.7199999999998,1899.1999999999998, It's got to talk about it
1899.1999999999998,1902.8799999999999," I'm dying to talk about this. Yeah, okay. Well, let's talk about the FK right now"
1902.8799999999999,1905.52, I mean this is gonna be some redundancy to this new section
1905.52,1910.32, We've gotten our in a magazine or working on now where it's kind of like a podcast page and it's not we're not transcribed
1910.32,1914.6399999999999, We're not transcribing we're not transcribed in what we'd talk about here on the page
1914.6399999999999,1918.4799999999998, There's nothing to do with this. We are not really a spirit. We're bringing the spirit of this
1918.72,1920.48, This motherfucker the right to the right
1921.68,1923.68, We can never true
1923.68,1931.1200000000001," So, okay, so but one of the things we're talking about is just FMV and general and games and what the deal is on that"
1931.2,1935.6, So my first reaction on this and then or I can give you mine
1935.6,1942.32, Why don't you give yours is your guys first as being people who are highly accustomed to getting the FMV in your games
1943.04,1945.28, Highly a shock to me it's been a while time
1946.3999999999999,1951.84, And it's just kind of funny they resurrected it for this because it was kind of it was very comfortable to me because it was exactly the same style
1951.84,1957.84, It was like the super cheesy high camp like part of me the thing that either makes it a Brexit for me is like
1959.28,1963.52, Like me thinking does EA or whoever's making the FMV game in question
1964.1599999999999,1969.6, Realize how crappy this is and if they do and if I think they do then I'm on board with it and if I if
1970.24,1973.76, Like they don't then suddenly it just like let's do fit. That's always like a big thing
1973.76,1982.1599999999999, It's like if someone is aware that they suck it's okay for them to suck but if they don't I don't know like some people by end of that like and I do and I'm like
1982.1599999999999,1986.48," Yeah, camp is okay fine. I'm on board with camp and some people are like no way right"
1986.48,1990.32," Are you on where are you on that side of the fence? Well, I think it looks like oh you do"
1990.32,1994.3999999999999," Why man? Well, I think the thing I'm I'm starting to wonder if they actually were trying to go for camp"
1994.3999999999999,1996.9599999999998, I mean I haven't seen the video yet mind you. I'm just going off the
1997.6000000000001,2003.44," Has their using I mean they have some like notable actors in there. Yeah, but do you pay for like Trisha Helver and"
2003.92,2009.68, Whoever Grace Park humor is yeah Grace Park and then I would pay for her. I mean do you pay it and and and
2010.08,2012.76, It's a so here what's it's a deez real name gosh how the way
2013.16,2015.16, You know all these people's real names
2016.4,2021.92," They got so in there space in my room for this hey, I mean, I just they're not I mean, it's not like a game"
2021.92,2027.76, The lot like getting a you know Tom Cruise or whatever on your cast or but but it's costing them something right
2027.76,2031.44, I mean otherwise they would just have like the QA team I'll go down to the Mocaps studio and
2032.0,2034.4, You know pop lock and top rock for a while
2035.44,2037.92, Put some laser sounds in the background and get to go
2038.72,2044.0," But get the cast of breaking electric bug-lip so yeah, I think that is important just like the same way that like"
2045.3600000000001,2050.16," Listeners write in and they get mad saying oh, he's got who's guys staying to your making fun of nerds all the time"
2050.16,2054.96," I don't think the real is nerds to but then the rest of people say yeah, they know their nerds. That's like the whole point of it"
2056.24,2059.72," It's kind of like that with the movie, but for me it's hard"
2059.72,2063.44, I just I do not know I'm I'm convinced actually I'm not convinced
2063.44,2067.56, I'm pretty certain that they think that this is hot stuff that's straightforward
2067.56,2069.56," They don't yeah, no"
2069.56,2070.56, You know no
2070.56,2073.96, Asides or anything or smurks or wings. It's like this is here some
2074.3999999999996,2079.14, Good shit right here. You don't think that's crossing their mind that this is the thing is like at least slightly cheesy
2079.14,2082.66, But if they did a smurker a wink that would totally ruin it so I mean totally would
2082.66,2087.3799999999997, It's gonna be played straight. It's got to be played as part of like it's like the toxic Avengers like a classic
2088.8199999999997,2092.74, Now I'm confused maybe I take it back maybe it's better. You man when they know it sucks
2092.8199999999997,2097.58," Then it's stupid. I then you've get then you get like scary movie and shit, but when they think it's rad"
2097.7799999999997,2101.22, And it sucks then you get then you get the the COVID and
2103.22,2106.42, That's exactly as about as much as much a reference. I'm saying it that way
2106.42,2109.3, That's how that's how the director pretty sick because he doesn't want it to write a bit of it
2109.3,2114.1," Right, but that's if you've seen the the movie they're talking about a marriage called American love that movie"
2114.1,2116.5, Some of the greatest documentaries. Why is the sequel?
2117.14,2119.9, I mean the same director made a movie called home movie
2119.9,2122.14, Home movie that's what I want to say. I told what I see that's what I want to say
2122.14,2124.42, But the guy that made the the the COVID
2124.42,2128.42, The reason why I'm trying with oven is just he's completely sincere
2128.42,2132.4," And he makes just this god awful movie, but it's so rad because the guy's so earnest"
2132.7200000000003,2136.7200000000003, He shows it to you
2137.44,2143.6," You think that's what's going on. You know, I think it's kind of like that because when Kane is addressing me from like what did I call the"
2144.1600000000003,2146.8, Halloween version yeah from the spirit Halloween store
2147.2000000000003,2154.08, He's like five minutes go. He took office eye patch and left the midways offices where he was playing a cano and Mortal Kombat
2155.44,2159.48, Shaved his head that morning guy self-alset and then it's over to the other studio and
2160.44,2164.36," Dropsides and then like then the other guys are standing in front of like EA's server bank, right?"
2164.36,2168.2400000000002," You know, there's just flashing there. Where can we go to get flashing lights? We need blinking lights"
2168.2400000000002,2171.44, You need something to serve the UI for the game is background on the monitor
2171.44,2179.28, So they put like a space be about them and and I think it stands out more because because like the production quality for television has gone up right over
2179.28,2181.88," You know, like you know, you look like a bow start galactic or something"
2183.0,2185.32, It's like the price of entry is that much higher
2185.84,2189.88, It actually looks good so it makes it look chinsier when there's people running around
2189.88,2194.2400000000002, It's like do those are people running around a front of a matte paint right and the other really obvious
2194.52,2200.04, The other problem is the way they interact is because they're talking to you the player who obviously has absolutely nothing
2200.04,2204.76," They can say and respond to these people so you're just kind of like yeah, you can't it's like Gordon Freeman you know"
2204.76,2209.7200000000003, The whole thing where we were talking about before Gordon Freeman's awkward because you have like crying women and
2210.44,2213.8, Alex and you're like just what all you can do is like check up and create some throw them out
2215.32,2220.04, But it's even more awkward because it's real people so it's creepy like one of those like POV pornos
2220.04,2223.48, I don't know how I know that is but I do because
2224.2000000000003,2228.28," Actually, I know how I know how to write there's here's the whole thing it's like when I went to to"
2229.2000000000003,2231.2000000000003, visit
2231.2000000000003,2235.92, The Vanity published a 50 cent game to go to go to a coverage on the 50 cent game for EGM
2236.2000000000003,2239.8, Like they sat me down in the studio and this thing was like wall the wall was covered in
2240.4,2242.4, 50 cent albums anything had done you know
2242.4,2246.88, They got posters of like the vitamin water that that dude's like that dude put his formula and
2248.28,2254.0, If they had the POV so they're like you know this is just another party the five 50's empire is he like breached
2254.0,2257.28, He's breached out and all these various you know media. So is he like buckaroo bonds?
2258.48,2261.76," Yeah, I don't know what that's what that means either"
2262.48,2264.48, There are neurosurgeon ninja
2264.48,2270.0," Physicist okay, I got all trades. I didn't go to buckaroo bonds. I saw the trailers for buckaroo bonds. I horribly good"
2270.72,2276.8," So he is like that. Yeah, so he not only is like he can call he's a mixologist and concox like water that's good for you"
2276.96,2282.64," It's not just water, but check it's good for you. Oh, unlike regular water. It's basically just grape drake"
2283.28,2285.28, Put some grape grape
2285.76,2287.76," Food coloring in water, but"
2287.76,2291.36," But then he had a POV porno's but anyway, that's like the kind of vibe. It's just like"
2292.0,2296.48, Something's something's not right right. I don't know like going into detail something is not right
2296.48,2299.6, I mean the only way you can picture yourself on the receiving end of this is just like
2300.96,2305.2, This is like trapped in like a box and just like grinning with the rise like
2305.76,2311.6," Go to open. It's like okay. Yeah, the camera man just materializes in your mind's eye and you're thinking of how awkward it is for like grace"
2311.6,2316.08," Part to be sitting there like talking into that. How do you act against that? Yeah, but you're talking to me"
2316.8,2324.08," Where I do think it works though is like when the little picture and picture box comes in and when you're actually in the game when you're getting an update or uh, you know"
2325.6,2329.68, I don't know you're just you're okay when you're getting an update. That's good enough. I don't need to add any
2330.0,2334.16," Yeah, I know what that means. Yeah, you're a little bit bad on a little thing pops. We play computer games"
2334.16,2337.12," Then it weren't yeah, it works because like I guess the scale you're like okay"
2337.12,2342.48, I could be a general interacting with the better battlefield and in this perspective and with this level of detachment
2343.44,2348.0, And it's not so jarring that you've got like real flesh and blood people and individual
2349.28,2352.16, Computer generated imagery on the one part and I thought that worked fine
2352.56,2356.0," Well, I guess because that convention was kind of started with the FMV stuff and then they gonna just"
2356.32,2359.04," As the CG got better, they put that in that little window instead"
2359.6,2363.6, So it kind of like never really left like it never really left the genre that was always there
2363.6,2367.52," Yeah, so that part works for me, but it's almost like it's just telling like of how"
2368.24,2375.76, Far graphics have to go when you start juxtaposing the two when you're when you're shuddling between you just did your right and also reminding you of like how
2376.4,2378.4, difficult it is to
2378.8,2380.8, inject and kind of character
2381.2,2384.88, or like you know personal drama into the game of this genre
2386.08,2391.04, You're dealing you're throwing like you make it this is a kind of game get real like I'm gonna make five like
2392.0,2394.32, Hundred dudes with machine guns and send them out because
2394.96,2398.4, 490's not enough to kill like the other guys they have you're all gonna get wiped out
2398.4,2400.8, But I'm gonna get to take the base where's the and then all of a sudden
2400.8,2405.04," There you're like okay, I think grace park likes me. I saw the way shoes looking at me"
2406.4,2410.48, Really weird fit for them to do it and I understand why they want to put that in but but then
2411.2,2415.92, But I'm I'm I got a cryo and soldier number 307 cries in his death
2416.56,2420.32," And it's okay, now build another one and all that holds for other games two company heroes"
2420.32,2425.36, Which we love is the same thing but they just do the cutscenes in the game engine so it's less jarring but you still have that
2426.32,2428.32, You still have that disparity between
2429.04,2434.08, You got these people in your supposed to care for mature like okay obviously that wasn't the first group of engineers that ran up and got mowed down
2434.08,2436.08," Okay, it wasn't the second it wasn't the third"
2437.04,2440.48, Just pretend it was the guys that I end up winning the winning the map with you know
2442.24,2443.84, to me like I'm I'm not
2444.48,2446.96, Of command conquer expert but
2447.2000000000003,2452.48, Being at the beginning game just kind of gives me bad flashbacks of entasmicaloria and mad dog
2453.2000000000003,2459.1200000000003, Dude don't say a bad word about mad dog that dog is hot. I drop mad quarters on that game. I found out if you
2459.84,2465.1200000000003, I did I look I searched for it on YouTube. I was showing Sean and it's even better because it's the Sega CD version
2465.6800000000003,2469.84, Someone has like it's someone taped up them playing through the levels trying to control the gun
2470.0,2475.92, It's even like shidier and like more digitized in the Sega CD one and instead of an actual light gun you move a little curse
2476.48,2480.0, Of a crappy like eight bit pixel gun around the screen and you shoot it the guys
2480.56,2484.8," I got to say when those things were coming out like and corpse killer and yeah, yeah"
2485.52,2489.1200000000003, Space pirates when those things were during the hey day of FMV
2489.1200000000003,2494.56, I just totally unbored like I thought this was awesome and like looking back and there's like what the hell was I thinking
2494.56,2497.76, But I I got the Sega CD day one because like I want to play night crap
2498.0800000000004,2507.1200000000003, I was like I want to see Dana play it on a nighty awesome. I'm all over that Ryan was doing it for 50 bucks less with the Captain Power VHS and his little Starship toy
2507.1200000000003,2509.1200000000003, It's a little you what dude
2510.48,2515.6800000000003," Shoot at the screen okay, by the way. I was so I was out total like non-secreter, but I was at one of the comments"
2515.6800000000003,2517.6800000000003, We saw and I saw
2517.6800000000003,2522.5600000000004, Captain power collection the entire the entire one of the series for a me 125 bucks
2522.88,2525.2, It's gonna make some some man-made
2527.6,2530.48, I can see like some gravy drinking man-baby at home like
2532.48,2535.84, And the Phoenix and the triple XL man diapers
2537.12,2540.08, It this will go perfectly with my Captain Power spaceship at home
2541.36,2545.2, I have that I go in down a level. I just said he bought like triple XL man diapers man
2545.6,2547.6, Like how is the having the ship anymore?
2547.68,2549.68, Preminating
2550.08,2553.44, Check it not only does this guy have diapers you got the ship
2554.7999999999997,2558.88, So that I can actually play with the ship and not go to the bathroom you drop the diaper
2559.68,2562.64, What else did you see there let's take this because condicons are usually
2563.44,2567.2799999999997," You know actually fertile fertile territory. I have to show you the pictures later, but"
2567.92,2569.68, There was a costume
2569.68,2572.08, Masquerade you know contest awesome
2572.7999999999997,2577.12," Oh, man, I saw some I actually I'll post some of the pictures up on the on the boards after the after we do this"
2577.68,2579.68, Speaking of speaking of costumes
2579.68,2583.2, I saw some some huge fat dude like a night wing t-shirt
2583.6,2587.12, Just like the night wing logo and when I explain night wing to the same
2587.8399999999997,2592.88, Night wing to Batman care what's my grunt robin champion child first entirely
2594.24,2596.88, It's a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a
2597.44,2600.16, Let's just say they've been working together for a certain amount of time
2600.4,2603.2799999999997, He will be coming to his own you know you become a he'll become night queen
2603.6800000000003,2605.28, He makes fun of that
2605.28,2609.44, He actually know that was a good that's the whole thing on same people like like I makes fun of nerds
2610.0800000000004,2614.6400000000003," You makes fun of nerds, but he wouldn't know the stuff that that he makes fun of if"
2615.6800000000003,2619.0400000000004, If he wasn't a nerd himself know what that well
2619.6800000000003,2621.6800000000003, Trap you got us
2621.6800000000003,2623.6800000000003, How do you think
2623.6800000000003,2629.6800000000003, How do you figure it's like we all run into the comics story the same stupid issue you just start you can't start off a story
2630.08,2635.6," So I was at one your con the other day and haven't got anywhere but like in elimination yeah, and watch"
2635.6,2640.96, I meant to let me introduce this. I meant to introduce this term before washa w a h
2641.3599999999997,2644.96, j a h and as far as I know it was coined by
2645.7599999999998,2648.56, St. Gen C s who's a member on our forums
2648.7999999999997,2650.7999999999997," No, because you're gonna say the actual saint"
2651.2,2657.3599999999997," No, but anyway, it's just like it's embarrassment my proxy, but in time you're sitting there and like so I mean you can say everything's washa"
2657.44,2660.32, I mean the the most accessible example would be anything
2660.88,2663.52,ology related we were watching it and it's just like embarrassing
2663.52,2665.52," If we embarrassed yeah, yeah"
2665.52,2669.76, It was true like here's the web is washa to you know some watching
2670.6400000000003,2676.6400000000003," Watching grace park do FMV for a video game, you know, it could be washa or mark hammer like going from"
2677.36,2680.96, You know the lead in this blockbuster movie to like
2680.96,2686.88, Ha ha ha bad you'll never for me or whatever actually seeing him be the weather wizard on the flash
2687.36,2693.6, TV series that was the washa that or the giver like they throw us some like super glued some plastic tube
2694.2400000000002,2695.6, Turned into a
2695.6,2697.92, You're like a rise like biting his tongue
2697.92,2700.16, I love that's we mark handle yeah
2701.68,2704.08, Levels in it that dude is down
2704.08,2705.76, He rebels and that dude
2705.76,2706.96," Yeah, like"
2706.96,2710.08, The weather was that guy whatever the whole one I was just gonna say he wasn't from
2714.08,2716.08, He was the text
2716.7200000000003,2722.08, Paced part the one the one the one the most manly nerd thing I did was I wonder
2722.08,2724.96, Come I saw I saw I got an early screener for 300
2725.84,2728.7200000000003, Holy crap that movie is awesome manly huh?
2728.7200000000003,2730.08, She's a whole thing
2730.08,2736.4," Actually, I I just got back from my honeymoon so I missed the yeah, I can actually had a limited screening so I missed that but I did catch a"
2737.04,2742.48," So they showed a chunk of it the next day, but during Q and A panel and you're willing to say the movie is awesome based on the chunk"
2742.48,2749.12," You've based on the chunk I've seen it's I mean, I've read I read the original graphic novel by Frank Miller. I think I don't know like and I'm really looking forward to it"
2749.6,2751.28, This is that's not go to yeah
2751.28,2754.08," I don't want to take I don't want to take it too far off track, but"
2754.64,2755.92, Definitely check out that movie
2755.92,2756.88, Well
2756.88,2758.64," Okay, so sorry, so we're back"
2758.64,2762.0, What the game what about the gameplay of scenes here real quick from the demo that we've played
2762.96,2765.36, One thing that surprised me coming out of company heroes
2766.32,2768.32, And into the CNC is
2768.56,2772.88," I mean how similar they are in a lot of ways, but then also how like weird how how"
2773.2000000000003,2779.04, Unused to some of the like the standards of the older style RTS I am like for example in the second mission of the demo
2779.76,2785.84, I created a Jeep and I threw some infantry garrison some infantry training took it out to scout through the fog war and see what what was going on around
2786.56,2790.7200000000003, And the first thing I run into is this like sizable trope of of nod guys
2791.6,2795.52, And they just start blasting hell out of me so I'm like okay like let's just change plans
2795.52,2799.2," I'll take it back to my base, but they follow me back to my base. This is like in the first minute"
2799.7599999999998,2804.3999999999996, And then the next thing I know there's this giant fucking army at my base just blasting the shit out of me
2804.9599999999996,2809.04," And like dude, if company heroes like they would it would be the same thing like they wouldn't be doing that for one"
2809.04,2814.3199999999997, They would be I mean they have some annoying AI stuff that I call it spite capping where the AI just wants to completely break your
2815.68,2818.56, Supply lines and it'll spam pioneers in your back field
2818.88,2826.72, But it's like what was I supposed to do just sit there and farm like the stupid kryptonite for like a half an hour and build up
2827.36,2831.04, Build up an army and then go I mean like why do I even have a scout Jeep?
2831.04,2835.12, The only thing it's gonna do is I'll learn like this like bullshit army that's gonna come back and
2835.7599999999998,2837.7599999999998, Mess me up in the first minute of the game
2838.08,2841.36," Well, it's almost like you have to like let's like basically that those that that scout"
2841.6,2842.96, Troop you created it have to be like a
2843.6,2845.36, Just let them die I'm dying the wild
2845.36,2852.32, It depends on the game because I know that I guess that's true. We don't want to keep it like well if you were scout and you run into an invasion army
2852.6400000000003,2858.08," No, bring but you know 800 units strong would you take them right back your headquarters or would you just sit there and die?"
2858.48,2860.48, Of course gonna die
2861.76,2867.28," Yeah, I mean it depends on the game because like some games they have these you know pre established cryptid bases already set up"
2867.28,2871.84," That's crazy you can't get to it till you firmer everything. Yeah, you send your scout guys and alert them"
2872.1600000000003,2875.6800000000003, They all might just go back into position right so I don't know this might just be a demo cork
2875.6800000000003,2878.56, I'm not just what is weird. I don't know what to sure you what you said
2878.56,2880.56," Just the demo. Yeah, but like I"
2880.56,2882.4," It's our it turned it off and I was like okay, whatever"
2882.4,2887.6800000000003, I mean it's pretty stand out that supposed to tech up and then go out with like a stronger force
2887.6800000000003,2892.2400000000002, But it just seems so like it's pretty standard that like in a campaign for an RTS
2892.6400000000003,2896.1600000000003, You know you I know company of heroes is like your main like entry point and so
2896.1600000000003,2897.44, Right
2897.44,2899.44, This is most of them speaking from like they're not
2899.84,2902.32, Building up at the same time as you in the same fashion
2902.32,2905.32, You already there and you're kidding your building up your force and going out
2905.32,2908.08," Right, it's not always the case, but that's it's a pretty standard"
2908.08,2913.36," Yeah, and again I haven't played the demo so I don't know is it structured more like the single-player game or is it like"
2913.84,2915.84, The demo was
2915.84,2917.04, A campaign it is
2917.04,2919.44," Okay, I'm a tutorial is kind of one"
2919.68,2922.32, Just can't build this now put it in your near and this now
2922.32,2929.2000000000003," I am can it plenty of scripting and company heroes and stuff. Yeah, but it's just like I just was I just wanted some I want someone to reassure me and say"
2929.2000000000003,2933.4," Okay, no, there is like there are stages of the game where you want like you know"
2933.4,2938.1600000000003, Come here's there's a distinct like an infantry phase where you're fighting with your infantry
2938.1600000000003,2940.96, You can stop and then the light vehicle phase you can forego those and decide
2941.1200000000003,2945.28, You know like you can say I'm gonna like try to speed tech up and I'm just gonna skip the light vehicle phase
2945.28,2948.88, But then you're gonna be at a disadvantage while you're while you're saving your resources
2948.96,2955.12," You know and you're only able to do that if you're like winning or if you're going on a pose and your infantry phase, but like where you have time"
2955.12,2958.6400000000003, You don't you know I'm saying like you don't you're it's not all of a sudden a matter of like
2958.6400000000003,2964.1600000000003, I need to know how to field every type of injury and every type of like heavy vehicle and every type of you know
2964.1600000000003,2968.2400000000002," Er, er, you and all it wants it's like you work your way up to that point and the end"
2968.2400000000002,2972.96, It's just you're orchestrating all of them together and it's really rewarding but you've in the beginning of every match
2972.96,2977.28, You start off using a few pieces and and you'll build those so someone out there
2977.28,2983.44," Tell me that no, it's not like that you don't have to sit there and it also it's hurdle and tech up and does it feel like I mean like again"
2983.44,2986.6400000000003," I'm operating in the in the dark right out, but right when you're playing the demo"
2986.6400000000003,2991.6400000000003, Does it feel like it was like the very first tutorial mission or is it like they just pulled out and mission like level mission three or something
2991.6400000000003,2993.2400000000002, It was definitely early
2993.2400000000002,2996.0800000000004," I was talking about the first I mean yeah, there's like tutorial missions"
2996.0800000000004,2999.0400000000004," I did before that where it's like super handholding you get like this, you know"
2999.0400000000004,3003.28," Well, what I'm saying and you blast them and I mean that was the only reason I asked that was crazy"
3003.28,3008.32, Like from what I remember from past CNC games that I played is how they had like the structured scenarios where basically
3008.8,3011.6000000000004, Like like like like Sean's like when I was pointing out how
3012.44,3014.44, You want to like very slowly
3014.8,3019.1200000000003, Explore and go and branch out and and I'm kind of build up your base otherwise
3019.4,3023.6400000000003," You know you risk it string the hornets necessarily on yeah, totally or that's fine"
3024.28,3029.2400000000002," But it's definitely it's a chance to do that, but it's definitely more scenario contact that was it. It was last contact"
3029.24,3032.9199999999996, I had a similar experience with galactic civilizations too over the weekend when I played that
3032.9199999999996,3036.2, There's this one mission where I was kind of building up quietly and I decided
3036.52,3040.04," All right, I'm gonna put like a military star base right on the edge of my"
3040.64,3042.64, Civilization and I'll let it was set off
3043.24,3049.04," Terrant Alliance you know the earth people yeah, and simply just a flood of these guys that had just been like"
3049.04,3054.12," Well, where they come from just came to like wait me out because I put that thing in the wrong spot too early"
3054.12,3059.44, So I don't know if that was like part of the scripting or if that was like some weird fluke
3059.64,3064.72, That's just how the I can't I built you know I didn't blame him. I was like all right
3064.72,3066.72, I put a military star base on your border
3067.0,3071.3599999999997," Yeah, that's what happens. Yeah you instigated like I'm sure I crossed some like"
3072.12,3076.7599999999998, Official line where we had made if I I paid closer attention to the cutscenes
3078.12,3083.52," Yeah, I was all explained by Grace Park. Yeah, you kind of glaze over across this line ever"
3084.12,3086.12," All right, yeah"
3086.12,3087.12," Okay, would you would you follow?"
3087.52,3093.68," Not because he's explained is like a very charismatic leader of the world, but like when you mean he means can can can yeah"
3093.88,3096.88, we would you like if you saw him transmit his
3097.7999999999997,3102.7599999999998," Message of hope from the red horrible hell room would you like oh yeah, I'm behind that guy that should"
3102.7599999999998,3107.24, It's just like ludicrous at face like the same reason I turned off the refervendetta when we rented that
3107.24,3110.12, I know like people are probably
3110.12,3112.12, Complanned
3112.12,3115.68, Like we put at that same thing it's like that that scene it's like it everything
3115.68,3123.08, We take over the TV station and yeah brought cast our formula for revolution and it means it's just some dumbass and immediately like
3123.08,3128.96," Yeah, you like yeah, you like that crazy guy on the map talk go Belly is 49 cents to expense for the soft taco"
3128.96,3130.96, I do need fourth meal
3133.56,3135.56," All right, what you laugh at that"
3136.4,3138.4, Ah
3138.4,3140.4, Honey
3140.4,3142.4, So I
3142.4,3150.88," Okay, anything else we can plan but PC stuff PC stuff I'd say no and I'm proud to say I did not play world warcraft once on my honeymoon"
3151.52,3155.2," Nice dude, I did not go in our we actually in our podcast when you're gone"
3155.2,3158.56, I think we we said that we're gonna be watching for you
3158.56,3164.84," They were making sure that you didn't appear anywhere and as a rough yeah, there were no cat. Although what I got off the plane"
3165.56,3169.08," I figured okay, I'm gonna be free of the yoke of gaming for two we whole week"
3169.08,3172.52, So I won't have to think about anything. I could just detox and all that and
3174.08,3178.4, Nothing game is toxic but you played you were playing some handheld stuff though
3178.4,3180.4, I only on the flight home
3180.4,3187.12," Okay, yeah, I did have restraint and also wife to kick my ass if I if I fired up anything"
3187.12,3191.4, We know but I get off the plane and then and like I'm walking around Auckland and all the sudden
3191.4,3194.08, There's like some some dude with a wild t-shirt and a quest giver cap and
3194.6,3195.4, And
3195.4,3201.44, Everywhere and I go log into it in our cafe just to let my folks know everything's alright and just a whole
3201.44,3204.08, whole clan playing wow I'm like
3204.52,3206.7599999999998, Just because you're the you're the chief
3208.24,3211.6, Sour cream squirter at Taco Bell doesn't mean you get off the plane and

3264.04,3270.76," Well, my actually that sounds like Schwarzenegger oh, I didn't quite have that like fuzzy the beard like scratch at the end"
3270.76,3272.76, But who am I?
3272.76,3275.4," Actually, I didn't sound right either. I'm gonna give up on that one. All right"
3275.4,3279.08," Move on all right, so yeah other than that. Let me see if I played hotel dusk and"
3279.48,3281.48, Final fantasy dream idea that's on the flight so
3282.44,3284.76," Yeah, okay, Ryan what do you plan"
3285.56,3289.2400000000002," Yeah, I've been wow still wow yeah, I mean, I'm gonna get a four-go the wow count"
3289.4,3294.28," Okay, you have a whole podcast for that now. I'm starting to get slightly burned out. I guess really"
3295.4,3299.08, So I'm doing a bunch of battle and no more guild wars for you
3299.08,3301.08," Not lately, no, okay"
3301.72,3303.72, I have something else there's always something else to do in that
3305.88,3314.12, I'll volunteer. I poop socked Xbox 360 over oh right right and so I played I went picked up a street home court and played a lot of that
3315.0,3319.64, And really made some yeah made some characters that we made the self-loat and the jib you cite
3321.08,3324.6," So these guys need to become famous jib you say yeah, I made shit. I made a point"
3324.6,3328.44, I was gonna start calling everyone jib sites and they're behavior jib you sit it and all these other jib
3328.44,3334.36," Call it and all this stuff but forgot you haven't done that yet. No, so the jib you said the legend the jib you cite is like the gurgas"
3334.36,3336.36, That needs to be yeah
3336.36,3337.7200000000003, needs to be proliferated
3337.7200000000003,3343.2400000000002," Do you need to explain the character's away the gurgas always just like so go go go go go yeah, yeah, Google it also Brian peppers"
3343.56,3349.8, But so I did that and then mainly I started I played the demo for a crackdown co-op
3350.52,3355.8," And we played that like all Friday and I'm like, okay, you know what like I got a like all Friday and I am like, okay"
3356.2000000000003,3361.6400000000003, We got to go get this game so the next morning. I went and got the full game and just played it co-op and
3361.8,3367.8, first I was like there's no way I'm gonna like this because I've been sick of I've been an outspoken critic of just having you know
3367.96,3371.48, Had not having had too much GTA post post GTA three
3373.1600000000003,3379.8, And I never finished San Andreas and I kind of got sick of it halfway through and I just really didn't want to mess with the generic ones
3379.8,3383.2400000000002, It was like if rock stars like oh and if their original thing wasn't doing it for me
3383.24,3389.9599999999996, I sure is held in order deal with and it could be wrong because I just I was just making these calls based on what I had seen or heard the same way
3389.9599999999996,3394.52," I did with crackdown and I think I was I've been proven wrong, but the Saints rose and the"
3395.3999999999996,3402.4399999999996, Fear and respect never came out the whole thing a fear. It doesn't respect then much respect
3403.8799999999997,3407.08," But just you know more than I mean part of the thing is like, okay, I"
3407.56,3413.7999999999997," Understand what there is about GTA you know, and when I said GTA now I'm talking about GTA post three so"
3414.2,3416.2, Trying to correct me even though you haven't said anything
3417.64,3423.0, So everything about that if I understand why people are attracted to the deep structure the game
3423.0,3425.16, I want to say let's take that let's that's you know
3426.04,3430.84," Let's take that magic and and put it in some other circumstance, but instead of just doing that"
3431.08,3435.08, They're taking an entire package over and over again and that's what's pissed me off
3435.16,3438.2, It's like if you take a just random you know go back to comic nerd stuff
3438.84,3445.24," Frank Miller and Jeff Darrow did the hard-boiled book and it has nothing to do with the child in fat movies, but it's a super detailed"
3446.44,3452.68, You know futuristic world where I mean everything the buildings the cars like on every street and it's like so detailed
3452.68,3456.6," That there's something weird messed up happening everywhere. Yeah, like if you're gonna take this big world"
3456.92,3461.64, Why not just like make up what when it come up with some great new idea for one you know and then populate it with
3462.2,3465.96, All kinds of stuff so everywhere you go. There's something interesting to look at instead of just the same old
3466.44,3470.3599999999997," Interations of dick jokes on Marquis for for porno theaters and stuff like that, you know"
3471.48,3477.96, Why when I understand the need to say you you need to have you need to populate that this this world
3478.44,3481.08, With easily identifiable groups
3481.24,3486.92," Clans gangs of people and instead of going to the usual like okay, what have the Latinos?"
3487.8,3494.6800000000003," Okay, we'll have the you know we'll have the Russians who have the Asian gang the triads we'll have all these things and that made sense when"
3494.6800000000003,3497.0, GT did it but it's like even crackdown does it
3497.0,3504.04, It's like dude you can you're free to do what you want it doesn't have to be like the Mexican cartel the triad the
3505.08,3507.08, Just in franchise
3507.08,3508.12," Russia and off yeah, you know"
3508.12,3513.08," It's the same race breakdown pretty much yeah, I mean you don't have to repeat that every single time"
3513.56,3517.0, And so that was like another turn off to me too. You see it's like I mean come on
3517.0,3521.16, I know some imagination you have this perfect canvas to do what you want with it and and that like I said
3521.16,3526.2799999999997, You know the equivalent of the structure of the canvas the way that you're stretching it and you have this world and you're able to do
3526.2799999999997,3529.0, You know these different missions in it. You could drive in it and you can walk around
3529.64,3534.36, So that turned me off and it doesn't get that right either that stuff is still in there and it's still stupid
3534.44,3536.44, But the thing about the game
3536.44,3541.48, Is it's just so much fun to play and they understand like the design stuff
3541.72,3544.44, They get so much right that the GTA games haven't
3544.6,3549.08, It was like if you took someone and they were and they had a really like well-formed notion about what works about
3549.08,3551.4, GTA and what doesn't and they went made a game based on it
3551.4,3556.68," And I'm sure this is actually what happened. Well, this is totally what happened because they guy who created the GTA series like one and two"
3557.0,3561.4," Right, I think I'm I'm not sure if he was there for GTA three or if he left during the production of it"
3561.48,3566.76, But basically he's the guy who was at real the who had his real-time studios real-time worlds rather okay
3566.76,3569.6400000000003, Who's making crackdown and also there's another game by
3570.0400000000004,3575.0, Webset that working on it's an MMO version of that kind of recalling all cars AB APB okay
3575.8,3576.84," Oh, I'm not sure"
3576.84,3578.84, Reset not has nothing to do with the old Atari
3579.32,3581.32, Has not a new at the old Atari thing
3581.32,3584.84, I don't know if he had a call cars that's the David that's the David. I'll give a job
3584.84,3590.44," He went for a yes, so what they get right when I say that they they sort of skim through it and they they they"
3590.76,3596.1200000000003, Looked at what works in GTA. It's just the you know when you the typical person plays GTA and you hear it over and over again
3596.12,3599.7999999999997," You ask the someone's like oh, I'm not a gamer, but I have a PlayStation 2 and I play this GTA games"
3599.7999999999997,3603.08, I I just loved I don't well. I don't do the missions. I just love to go and
3603.88,3608.2," Actually, I might as well be quoting like damn Margaro when I went and interviewed him last he he pretty much said this"
3608.2799999999997,3614.44, Like I just get the car and I run everyone over and I get a million wine stars and I go as long as I can until they just kill me
3614.92,3620.48, And up since like everyone would do that but GTA has designed in such a ways that discourages that or if you do it
3620.48,3622.0, It's only an experimental
3622.0,3624.8399999999997, Sort of excursion right you're ultimately gonna be a prison
3624.84,3629.1600000000003, And then you're gonna lose your money and your weapons unless you're putting in cheat codes and you're quickly
3629.1600000000003,3634.04, Unless you're really like clever you're you're gonna just be mowed down the helicopters are gonna come and get you
3634.04,3638.6400000000003, And again and let's you're putting in a cheat code to get yourself rocket launchers to blow the helicopters up and stuff
3638.6400000000003,3641.96, I mean like there's that whole side of GTA that happens
3641.96,3647.1200000000003," I think when you start cheating, but everyone started doing it everyone knows those damn codes, you know"
3648.56,3651.4, And everyone wants to get and push the limits and gets that point
3651.4,3653.7200000000003, So you say like let's take the whole game and make it that way
3653.7200000000003,3657.12, There's no repercussions for it. You get the stuff right away
3657.12,3659.52, You're super powerful. You blow the shit out of everything
3659.52,3665.88, You've got the low gravity on already you don't put the code in so then traversing the city becomes awesome
3665.88,3668.6800000000003," I mean, it's almost like a hybrid of a like a spider man game or something"
3668.6800000000003,3672.8, You jump like the Hulk and there's this whole thing of like you get these agility orbs
3672.96,3676.1600000000003, Which is another part of the you know this game's been out for a few weeks
3676.1600000000003,3679.12, So I don't need to re-explain the whole thing on it especially on the GFW podcast
3679.2,3682.68, But basically the the usual you have a character and you can
3684.4,3691.7999999999997," Well, you're in the hands is attributes in the same way that you could just San Andreas, but just to like the you know the third power or something right and then"
3691.7999999999997,3696.08," Not only that, but the the targeting and the shooting is going to be perfect"
3696.08,3699.64, It's get you're going to be able to shoot someone's hand if you want to knock the weapon out of it
3699.64,3701.68, There are legs if you want to drop them to be a shit
3701.68,3707.7999999999997, You're going to hit the gas tank on the car if you want or the tire and you're going to be able to do all this stuff really conveniently and understand what's happening
3708.76,3712.28, Combat you're going to be able to kick you can kick car you get strong enough
3712.28,3718.28, You can just like asshole physics like kick a kick a truck and knock it for like a mile like you know down the road or something
3718.28,3722.76," And I mean, that's totally funny. I mean you go and and the key to all this I guess, you know here"
3722.76,3724.1200000000003, I thought I was going to
3724.1200000000003,3728.92," Keep it short, but the key to all this is it's co-op and that this is what's so rad to me is that I"
3729.1600000000003,3734.44, Got tired of like the the foundation for GT but co-op does everything different because that
3734.76,3738.92, That's the kind I mean GTS the key gamer you always make these videos and you put them online look
3738.92,3743.08," I did this crazy jumper or you tell people you wouldn't believe it, but I flew the dough to for"
3743.4,3748.12, You know five minutes straight without crashing but it's like now you have someone there because it's always it's the
3748.52,3750.44, The watch me dive watch me dive
3750.44,3755.4, Know that that syndrome you get but you've now you've got a witness there with you and you can mess with them
3755.4,3759.2400000000002," So it's like you tell someone you get like okay, maybe my friend like let's climb the highest building"
3759.24,3762.3599999999997, Just so we can take a look off like whoa dude look over here
3762.6,3767.72," There's like a window farm so he looks and I'm like look over here, man. There's a theme park and he looks and I was just making it up"
3767.72,3770.2799999999997, They just take them off the kick them off the you know
3770.7599999999998,3773.0, But if you know put your boot in his ass and
3773.9599999999996,3778.04," All that kind of stuff you know, I mean like you in the interorganate on or whatever like you're like okay"
3778.04,3779.24, I was trying to help you. Yeah
3779.3999999999996,3785.16," One of you rides on the roof of the car, but is there is there so much fun because of that like and you look around"
3785.24,3791.7999999999997, You see each other jumping all over the map and all over the world and blasting guys is the game play kind of like just more like
3792.92,3796.44," Sorry Ryan, we'll keep with our Ryan sorry. Sorry. Can't entertain you actually yeah"
3796.68,3799.3199999999997," No, but as far as the game play they're like is it"
3799.48,3803.08, Encouraging the co-oppers just kind of like two guys playing the single pair of game together
3803.56,3806.92," Yeah, I mean I've heard people complain about that that it doesn't have like"
3807.96,3808.92, And
3808.92,3814.04, electronic gaming won't these shoes complaining that the co-ops not encouraged to the extent that like you know
3814.12,3818.68, Him in the people here playing he's playing with and that going off on their own and just collecting stuff
3818.68,3823.8," But if that's their own shortcoming, you know, right it's like I mean I'm playing with someone and we're almost I mean"
3824.2,3827.4, Just like sit-in through the game like rock and stuff but we agree like okay
3828.2,3832.04, Let's just get so we so we level up it around the same pace and around you know the same thing
3832.04,3837.8, It's like we would just work together and no matter what it's always helpful when you're working together and you don't need
3838.84,3839.96, I like that more you know
3839.96,3842.52, We're free-formed to work in the same way sometimes we'll like we're gonna
3842.7599999999998,3848.36, Attach some offshore oil refinery and we both do it from different angles and it works out fine instead of like in
3848.52,3853.32, You know gears a war or something where you just deliberately split the path and it's obvious and it forces you and says
3853.32,3857.16, Which one wants to go left and which one wants to go right and that's cool and stuff
3857.16,3861.16, But it's like I don't need that I mean it's kind of against the whole nature of the game
3861.32,3866.7599999999998, It's like you could do that if you want you go left and go right or you can go together and and be each other up as your feet and end in the up
3866.7599999999998,3868.7599999999998, You could do whatever you want
3868.84,3874.1200000000003, The one in terms of the gameplay the one short coming I see is that because you're so mobile
3875.0800000000004,3882.0400000000004, Especially as you power up your agility you're so fast jump so far that the vehicle segment is like pretty is almost poorly implemented
3882.36,3886.0400000000004, Because all you can really do with the with the cars and stuff is races which is stupid
3886.0400000000004,3889.7200000000003, It's a pet peeve of mine races in this kind of game when it gets not meant is a racing game
3891.5600000000004,3896.76, And it's just there's like a time-wester and it's cool that you do power up your driving in your car gets awesome
3896.76,3900.1200000000003, And you can do all this stuff but it's like you don't even really need it. It's like your spider man
3900.1200000000003,3903.96, And like put cars in one of the active visions you know open world spider man games
3904.5200000000004,3908.1200000000003," Right, just kind of like spider man suddenly that's poorly implemented and you know"
3908.1200000000003,3911.0800000000004, There's a bunch of head scratches like why aren't there more varieties of mission?
3911.0800000000004,3915.0, You know why aren't there planes and motorcycles and stuff but flat out like I could say
3915.5600000000004,3920.92, I was so into this over the weekend and like now when I go home tonight after like I have to go make some like
3920.92,3924.44, Grief and videos for a special project working on but I really want to go play crackdown
3925.4,3929.64, I think every like anyone if you're if you have a friend that you can be able to play it with like
3930.52,3935.08, Completely recommend it so much fun. It's so much more fun to me than the last time and it's too
3935.08,3938.6, It's only GTA. It's only over live. It's no split screen cover no split screen
3939.2400000000002,3940.68," Yeah, that's what things need so yeah"
3940.68,3945.96," Let's yeah, I said I have a bullshit excuse to turn that around so that it made sense for PC and that like co-op"
3946.36,3949.4," Kind of didn't do that to say well there. It's cool, but co-op"
3949.4,3951.4, It needs to be in everything. It's so I love co-op
3951.4,3954.36, I might be able to I might be able to pick it up pick up that bet on a rum with it
3954.36,3957.88, I was I'm playing a lot of catch up right now so I don't if you guys talked about previous podcasts
3957.88,3961.1600000000003, But I see that mercenaries two is coming to PC now as well
3962.04,3966.6," Yeah, yeah, yeah, co-op though. Yeah, nice. So I think that actually like that's really cool now"
3966.6,3970.6, I remember seeing a demo as I kind of have two in deduct because they only showed the p they were only shown the ps3 version
3970.6,3975.0, During E3 this past year. So I'm like great the game I can't play thanks a lot and
3976.2000000000003,3978.6, It turns out me so now that I guess there's a press release
3978.6800000000003,3980.2000000000003, I don't know how recently they came out
3981.0,3983.0, It's on its way for the PC as well and
3983.56,3988.3599999999997, From what I remember there's like these missions that encourage you to like work like the actually the missions are built so you're working together
3988.3599999999997,3994.8399999999997, So like one guy is piloting a helicopter the other guy comes in on the the winch and jumps off and kind of you know
3994.8399999999997,4001.3199999999997," Goes on whatever that sounds really cool. Oh, I'll sign up. I do that. I'll put it to you know"
4002.2799999999997,4006.52, Scripted where they want you to do everything just because it's like what we put this winter on here
4006.52,4008.52, We're gonna make sure they use it
4008.6,4014.04, The only way you can get in the compound even though there's no gate out front you can swapping where you should be able to walk in
4014.04,4018.28," Well, you gotta ride the winch. Well, the one they showed the one they showed actually was an oil direct just off shore"
4018.28,4021.24, So it's like kind of like the mission. I just subscribe
4022.44,4028.84, To the exact me and that's one of the in Russian land. They're called the bulk. It's kind of weird that the Russian games the bulk
4029.64,4031.64, I was wondering about that myself
4032.44,4035.24, That's the thing though dude that that game I had come back to it again
4035.24,4041.3199999999997, We made the point that this stereotypes but you start the game like what the it took me a minute to realize all the cars
4041.3199999999997,4043.3199999999997, It's like
4043.3199999999997,4045.3199999999997, Press your sod
4047.8799999999997,4051.08," Is it you started off of that it's like okay, but that might total overdose"
4051.64,4053.16, Yeah
4053.16,4055.16, We're a chili con carnage
4055.16,4058.9199999999996, Just came up right and what's your name for that game? I'll tell you a mine
4059.4799999999996,4061.0, Ground ice after auto
4061.24,4063.3999999999996, Do rides get a better one. I work too
4064.36,4066.04, What is yours Ryan?
4066.04,4069.7200000000003, No comment come on man you've been sitting there yon in the whole time like
4070.6800000000003,4072.6800000000003, Getting your chance to shine man
4073.48,4077.32," He's like the sun he's like the sun bob with the pie. Yes, I'm waiting for him like that one drop that one nugget"
4078.12,4080.12, Come on
4080.12,4082.12, I got nothing
4082.12,4084.12, All right
4084.12,4085.32, I'll blog about it tomorrow
4085.96,4087.96, 500 he'll piss off five more people
4088.04,4090.04, I'll do
4090.04,4092.04, So Sean the controversial
4092.04,4094.44, I know how about you anything outside of well
4095.32,4097.32," No, just the galsive two thing I had mentioned"
4098.28,4102.36, It's about it in the the CNC three demo anything any any
4103.4,4105.88, New observations to make on the galsive expansion
4109.08,4111.08, No
4111.08,4114.92, Really it's hard to I could really get into it. It's one of those things for like it
4115.88,4121.72, It adds a bunch of little things that if you don't know how the game works like me explaining it would be extremely dull
4121.96,4124.92," Right, but it's they're all they're all really good in hands-by-goose"
4124.92,4127.16, Galsive two like like civilization
4127.16,4132.52, It's very much like civilizate. It's weird like why I wonder why it is that you would draw that line there and I totally understand like I
4132.52,4135.8," I'm like nodding along like yeah, that makes sense because I don't want to hear about the minutiava"
4135.8,4139.8, But it's like I just got to talk about all the things you have cracked down or like you would
4140.76,4145.4800000000005," This is so ended to us yeah, I would have to explain all of the galactic civilizations and like"
4146.04,4150.92," Well, let me okay, let me give it a shot here. Okay, so a galactic civilizations one of the one of the things about it"
4152.28,4156.360000000001," That wasn't necessarily bad, but it would just a strange design decision is you can"
4156.92,4160.52, Right the beginning of the game first like dozen or so turns are super
4161.4800000000005,4164.52, Land grab oriented it's kind of like monopoly in a way that you just like you see
4164.92,4169.56, You got the whole map of the galaxy you see a planet that's in heaven. You just go as fast as you can to build a
4169.56,4177.8, Collinyship and get there right and so like the first like 20 turns of the game which is a very small percentage of the whole game like almost those turns are very very
4178.04,4183.72, Important if you don't get your Collinyship's out to the right locations your screwed that pretty much sets up your territory this one
4184.4400000000005,4186.92, They decided to add a tech tree
4188.360000000001,4189.400000000001, That
4189.400000000001,4192.04, Back it up a little bit now there are these planets out there
4192.92,4195.88, That are not immediately inhabitable they're like toxic or whatever
4195.88,4200.2, So you have to first research the technology to inhabit a toxic planet
4200.2,4204.6," Detoxify them yeah, or like has heavy gravity so you need to the less you need to life"
4205.24,4209.16," Yeah, I don't like try to Betty Ford so there's like four different types"
4209.32,4212.92, So once you explore the galaxy you can kind of get a feel for these places that you can't explore yet
4212.92,4217.8, But you know you'll be able to grab them later so it kind of makes the beginning of the game was hectic yeah and makes the
4218.68,4225.400000000001, Like the outcome of the game well they have slow it doesn't slow the pace it just makes the outcome of the game less dependent on those first 20 turns
4225.88,4229.64," And more spread out so you say okay, there's two toxic planets within reach"
4229.88,4233.88, I need to figure out how to balance you think a like bid and light gain terraforming and stuff then will
4234.4400000000005,4237.64, Allow you to get the terrain that you had used that just crab before right
4237.64,4242.76," Yeah, it's it's that I'm feeling it feeling it feeling it. Okay, so that stuff like that"
4243.24,4249.56, This asteroids you can buy now that and you plant a small occasionally explode into asteroid fields and you can mine those and those are a new resource
4249.56,4253.8, Which are a lot more easily divertable to like a planet you can just have a
4254.52,4256.52, Once some asteroid is mine you can just divert
4257.56,4262.4400000000005, The resources to whatever planet you want so that way you if you have like
4263.24,4271.0, Way galactic civilizations works a lot of times you'll have very specific planets that are doing specific tasks because you decided like
4271.0,4273.0, This is my manufacturing plant. This is my factory
4273.64,4278.2, This is my and whereas this other world is gonna be my research world so there's always universities and scientists
4278.76,4282.12, So you can decide okay learning there is learning in this game
4282.76,4287.64," So you decide like okay, I need I'm in a military phase. I need to really beef up my military production"
4287.64,4291.72, You can divert the asteroid resources to your military planet or whatever so you get your
4292.36,4295.08, You get your uh your worships a lot faster
4296.12,4302.28," That's great. So yeah, it's good stuff. It's really good. It's one of those expansions that like once you have it"
4302.84,4307.16, You can't really go back because like the changes it makes are all small but they're really good right
4307.5599999999995,4308.84, So there
4308.84,4312.92, Black to civilizations too. In a challenge is the game better than than so far
4314.12,4317.08, I haven't played all that much so far
4317.88,4319.16, Bad
4319.16,4321.72, I know it is exactly. Did it have it? Does it have a healthy
4322.68,4325.4800000000005, Are my community like multi there is no multiplayer oh
4326.12,4328.12, I'd ever play these thing multiplayer so that doesn't affect me
4328.12,4332.92, But that's like a big sticking point for a lot of people is like hey how come I can't do multi player the other thing this one does
4332.92,4336.92, Which I thought was gonna be a stupid gimmick but it actually turning out to be extremely
4337.24,4343.08, fun and a geeky and geeky sort of way. I don't really want to admit what I'm going to anyway is that you can make your own
4343.96,4348.12, Enemy races used to always make you be able to make your own custom race and you can like you know
4348.36,4350.28, Put your own portraits and stuff inside of the
4350.92,4352.52," Portraits folders, so you know"
4352.52,4357.72, Wanted to be a silent you could put your silent check on that. I can I can make the self-loid in the jib you say it's totally good
4358.28,4361.4800000000005," You can make the sideways totally good base jib you start to do it. Yeah, you start to do it. Yeah, you're good"
4361.4800000000005,4362.76, You're so I'd raise
4362.76,4365.8, So I started doing that with like I'll actually get to like shape what they look like
4366.04,4371.320000000001," Well, yeah, well, you stop playing with me MS paint program. No, no, no, there's the I mean if you wanted you could like"
4371.8,4375.0, Do your race in MS paint and then upload it. I mean
4375.0,4379.320000000001, So you can scan like like bright peppers and you can either get your kids so pretty much
4379.96,4382.6, Sorry with that and I'm sorry he's ready to apologize it
4383.72,4387.96, So something you have a new gamer who's ready to suddenly he's found a place in a people we can call home
4387.96,4392.76, Customizable actually I'm gonna create the gurgersoy's for sport when that's ready. I have been making a lot of
4393.320000000001,4395.320000000001, custom races
4395.88,4397.88, So anyway
4397.88,4399.88, Wrap this thing up
4399.88,4401.88, I'm getting the the spingers from Ryan's
4402.4400000000005,4405.320000000001, What I love is that you were giving your I think you're giving yourself the wrap it up signal
4406.2,4408.2, I was the weird it was just habit
4408.76,4409.96," Okay, like oh time down no matter"
4410.68,4414.6, No last last podcast. I was teasing out with the about the next cover story
4415.16,4417.400000000001, We never said what it was I mean ever will
4418.360000000001,4420.360000000001, Should we?
4420.36,4425.24, Like I mean just like the general like what it was like I give a hand or something and already did
4425.24,4429.4," Yeah, so this is R was the hand so relic was was the R and I put that out and"
4430.04,4433.88, Something involving at this point now like what was able to say something involved in company here?
4433.88,4437.719999999999, But it's not an expansion and that's all so just
4437.96,4441.08, Curious during curious you do we reveal a little bit more next week
4441.5599999999995,4446.599999999999, You know and also like I'm now I'm finally thinking back on the week and we had that great thing
4446.599999999999,4450.28, We had last week there and was our pledge drive episode what and we
4450.36,4454.12, Did all this stuff on there we got a lot of feedback a bunch of people that were saying why it is that
4454.759999999999,4457.639999999999, They give feedback to the because we're kind of like complaining
4457.639999999999,4463.0, We're being low-cried babies about how we will spend all month working on an issue and get comfortably
4463.08,4467.24, Fewer letters in response to to the to the months worth of labor
4467.24,4471.08, Then we will from sitting here shooting the shift or an hour or half you know
4471.24,4474.44, But so we got all these people that explained why they think one
4475.0,4480.12, Don't feel left out because they like to magazine and what they like about it and how it's just different and why they talk about
4480.12,4482.12, Why they like to talk about the podcast
4482.12,4483.32, So
4483.32,4487.48," I'm gonna say that for next week. Yeah, we'll come back to it next week and we also have a contest that's still going"
4487.48,4492.12," We'll extend it another good good responses to that yeah, and we so definitely have some winners to pick"
4492.12,4496.28," Oh, it's done. There's another way all this stuff I miss. I want to explain it in a read. Yeah, just to like"
4497.88,4504.04," Yeah, well, what am I saying then it's basically what's turned the current a turn an old CGW or"
4504.5199999999995,4511.16, Do you have to review that is bad into a positive review by editing words out right as a whole thread on the message
4511.16,4516.84, What is it really really passionate only yes taking out work putting in the legs is to get rid of words somebody did a good one on bad day
4516.84,4521.12, LA so nice several good ones and you can't add words some people are don't so like
4521.12,4525.44, I can't add words. This would be a fun game if you were locked on the short bus for whatever
4525.84,4529.04, 24 hours like this this this is fun game. This is fun game
4529.04,4533.14, So one of the guests is inspired by like the short movie quotes that like with the with the dot dot dot
4533.14,4534.84, a great movie dot dot dot
4534.84,4536.24, For shooting yourself to whatever
