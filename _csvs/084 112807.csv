74.0,75.0, That's right.
75.0,76.0, Its not JV University.
76.0,78.0, Well I think it's more like taking the GED.
78.0,79.0, Do you think?
79.0,80.0, Yeah.
80.0,83.0," I think that's like, I take the GED to get to the brodio."
83.0,86.0, Between hanging out at one doos house and going over to hanging out at another doos house.
86.0,93.76," out in another dude's house. Yeah. So we are missing Dan Glatt Stone, Sean Maloy, Ryan Scott,"
93.76,99.6," all for various and sundry reasons. Axie there here, they're just tied up and we're not knocking"
99.6,104.48," out the whole time. Well, you don't get it. Gotta get all specific. We need to tell everyone what's"
104.48,115.44, going on. So Ryan is having his bunions looked at by by Darren. That's why neither of them are here.
116.0,120.32, That's something involving the two of them. Yeah. Darren works wonders with the bunion file.
121.2,125.52, So he really got me. So we got the job actually. Yeah. And Sean Maloy's on vacation.
126.4,128.96," Lucky bastard. So the rest of us are here. And, uh,"
130.24,134.88," Mr. Elliott, you were gonna, I know the kids were going crazy for your safeway stories."
136.08,138.24, Oh shit. Yeah. Let's start the stuff. Let's start the stuff.
139.52,145.2," Well, because I saw some people were thinking that the the calls in the beginning were now some regular"
145.28,150.64," feature and it just happened that the first one was sort of un, you know, un-premetitated and just"
150.64,154.95999999999998," happened and then I didn't more and more, but that's not a regular feature. But there is a call that I"
154.95999999999998,162.0," made the fits in with safeway in that story I told. So I mean, that guy Billy Compton,"
162.0,166.0," oh Billy Compton worked with, he was tough to deal with. See the guy that peppy, he was the"
166.0,172.39999999999998," coat pack. I afraid. Oh, lie. Okay. And he, he, he, he was tough to work with. But he was kind of like,"
172.48000000000002,176.56," I don't know, I could forgive him. I could forgive his fault. But there is this other guy there. Steve,"
177.36,181.92000000000002," and he was huge. We call him, you know, Steve O at the time that was, you know, just made sense."
181.92000000000002,187.04000000000002," So we're like, as in Steve, oh, he's not believable. He eats so much to take a see."
187.04000000000002,192.64000000000001," The book. Steve, you think this in front of his, no, we need to every time you turn around."
192.64000000000001,199.44," Eddie, he, uh, we were tough like that. So this dude, he was huge, right? And he would always talk"
199.44,204.32, about how he was in the Navy. So we just like kind of privately wondered like what he possibly did.
204.32,208.07999999999998," Like if he served as displacement on a submarine, you know, like they'd let him out. When they wanted"
208.07999999999998,213.12," to come to the surface, and then they'd string him back in when they wanted to visit the deaths."
213.12,218.24," But so eventually I, I got into a tip with him and again, it was over, you know, following their"
218.24,222.8," customer service policy. And I just said, all right, Steve, oh, I'm out of here. And then I just walked"
222.8,228.64," out. But after that, that wasn't good enough. I had to let Steve O know indirectly as it were."
229.44,236.32, How much I appreciate appreciated him. So I started off with the series of calls. I told one before.
236.32,240.16, And that was where what we did to the donut case. So I don't revisit that. Most people should
240.16,245.92," recognize that when I say the donut case. Um, but then I called like the bakery one time."
245.92,250.0," And I made a super call to every department. But so I called the bakery and I said,"
250.0,254.32," you know, hi, I'm my name is, you know, Ron Sadler. I'm calling from Allied Signal. And we're"
254.32,258.72," about to celebrate our fifth anniversary, meaning business. And what we want is, you know, we're"
258.8,264.64000000000004," going to have a company picnic. And I want the biggest cake that you've ever made. So the thing is,"
265.20000000000005,270.88000000000005," this is really important to us. And this cake needs to show, you know, it needs to to represent"
270.88000000000005,278.0," Allied signals power, the fact that we're growing. And I know that you're an artist. And I want you to"
278.0,283.12," to show me how much of an artist you really are. And here's the thing, you know, we're, you"
283.12,286.72," not this one out. I'm going to come in there and we're going to buy everything, you know, we're"
286.72,290.08000000000004," going to go, we're going to get our fruit there. We're going to go to your deli and get everything"
290.08000000000004,294.48, else there. And I'm going to tell you your manager that all of it is because of you. So what I want
294.48,300.16," you to do, and I've seen, I want a whole city basically. And I've seen you've got ballpark cakes, you know,"
300.16,304.88000000000005," for kids to type a baseball field. I want that in the middle of this town. I want to, I want a"
304.88000000000005,309.68," big building. If you got to put frosting on cardboard, that's okay. But like a shining beacon"
309.68,315.28000000000003," for all the city in the middle, Allied Signal. Make this as, as many stories as you can. It was"
316.15999999999997,320.23999999999995," just kept elder all the stuff to put it. You know, everything that was like, what are"
320.23999999999995,324.0," their kind of case? You have. We could just take stuff from all those. You know, we can make a garden"
324.0,328.0," in there. And then I just kept saying, you know, how like, I know your an artist just like, no,"
328.96,333.35999999999996," no, I'm not in it. But anyway, so I follow through with the whole thing. And of course,"
333.35999999999996,337.44, I still knew people that worked there. And they actually made this thing. And it was the
337.44,343.11999999999995," status piece of crap that they've ever seen with like the junkiest slate gray, you know, some like"
343.12,348.4," a stolen condominium type of thing in the middle. It had the ballpark and everything. And of course,"
348.4,351.92, don't pick it up. So it went to the break room and it helped out all the employees. They got to eat it.
352.48,357.52," That was. So wait, how did that take revenge on the fat? Yeah. Anyway, what do you need to"
357.52,362.88," make a me more cake? What did he do? What did he do to you, whether it be a big fat day?"
362.88,367.84000000000003," Yes, just the usual stuff. They're their draconian policies about he was like watching you every minute."
367.84000000000003,371.6, He was your boss. You're loving everyone. Yeah. He was another boss. Because he was an
371.6,376.16," impure that you were just picking. Oh, no, no, they were. The stores were always, you know, run by,"
376.16,380.56," you know, a multitude of managers. And they all were together. Some are better than others, you know,"
380.56,385.92," and so Jeff, does this make you nervous that one day you will be the butt of Sonne, Sean Elliott,"
385.92,393.6," cake-making story? I'm not. I could be better. It's funny because, you know, like I spent,"
393.6,399.68," I spent years and years, you know, I flipped burgers. I was a bus boy. I watched dishes. I mean, I had, I've"
399.76,407.04," had all the fucking, you know, I had one job for one day as a phone sale. Not even a phone salesman."
407.04,412.32," I was the, what do they call? It was like a stringer for a salesman. Like you had to get down on the line"
412.32,418.32, long enough to talk to a real salesman. I lasted one day and that. So I've had some shit ass jobs.
418.32,423.68," And so the algae, algae pills. Yeah, people would eat algae. Yeah, I've, I can't remember the company,"
423.68,428.72, but I did it for a whole summer. I just took orders for algae pills. Wow. What do algae pills do?
428.8,433.04," I don't know. People bought me a bulk man, they bought it. Who's ridiculous? I didn't even have to"
433.04,438.32000000000005, try. It was forward-ringing off the hook every day. This phone job I had was terrible because it was for
438.32000000000005,446.40000000000003, selling hardware supplies to retailers. So it was like a whole sailor that was doing cold calls
446.40000000000003,451.84000000000003," to retailers. Like, you know, buy our, buy our hammers because we got the best hammers. So like,"
451.84000000000003,455.92," I wasn't even like selling a mouse. It's like, trying to get them on the line for the real tool salesman"
455.92,460.64000000000004," to come on. But like, I don't know, fucking shit about any of this. That's it. Backwards, too,"
460.64000000000004,465.36," because the most important part of the call is the introduction. You know, the first exact second. Right."
465.36,470.88," So they got some dumb ass 17 year old kid who doesn't know anything that's not like, you know,"
470.88,475.28000000000003," pinball related because that's Saule Am. You know, wasn't like video games, back then. But I didn't"
475.28000000000003,479.36," know anything about the product at all. I'm not a, I'm still not a handy guy. I'm, you know,"
479.36,483.04," I'm a grown man. I stuff the higher people to do shit because I don't, I can't do it because I don't,"
483.04,488.56," I'm not interested. So, you know, I would have to call these guys up and there's a hardware store."
488.56,493.36," That's what this guy's living, you know, and they get some call, you know, the phone rings and"
493.36,500.8," it's some dumb ass kid going, you know. And yeah, hi. How are you? And then I'm like looking at the"
500.8,505.28000000000003," sheet like what I'm supposed to, you know, how how you doing out there today. It's nice at, huh?"
505.28000000000003,512.64," Yeah, what do you want? I go out. I was just wondering if you guys had any need, we're having"
512.64,519.6," a special on on screws. And it'd be like, what kind of screws? They would actually, they would"
519.6,524.88," ask me to hang up. They would ask like two questions down to where I was lost, where I had no clue."
524.88,531.84," Like, well, are those like, you know, whatever they'd throw out some, you know, 240 by something and"
531.84,538.16," I go, let me, please hold for real sales. Yeah, that's what I'd have to do. If I could get them to"
538.24,545.8399999999999," not, not hang up on me, then I'd say, yeah, exactly. Please hold for. But I lasted one day. I was"
545.8399999999999,551.36," out to door that day. In fact, by the, about the six hour, and I had not made one call, not one call,"
551.36,556.4," had gone through to the salesman, the supervisor like walks over. And he just like gives me the,"
556.4,560.9599999999999," he's like, points his finger towards him, you know. And I just like took my jacket off the check"
560.96,566.64," because I knew. I was like, yeah, but I got this. I was a nice summer. I'm out. Anyway,"
566.64,572.64," point of that whole long-term version is that I've had shit jobs. And I, you know, I've had really"
572.64,578.1600000000001," shitty bosses. So I understand what it's like to hate your boss and be that way. And if you hate me,"
578.1600000000001,583.6800000000001," Sean, I'll understand. Oh, I've had terrible bosses. Did you work at EB? Yeah, my, I worked at a"
583.6800000000001,588.48," game stop. My guy was a crook. He was an absolute crook. He was like, yeah, he would like me. He"
588.48,592.4," would buy, he's like, buy the Pokemon cards, all the Pokemon cards buy that like open them up,"
592.4,596.32, and then like sell the individual cards. And then we had no skewers in the computer for
597.04,600.48," we had no skews for like the individual Pokemon cards, but he'd still find a way to sell them,"
600.48,604.5600000000001," and then like take money and it's own pocket and like short ship like, like, you know,"
604.5600000000001,609.28," see, see the bank's like, he's going through for like, oh, yeah, yeah, like, oh, my god, like the"
609.28,616.48," Charizard man, Charizard was big. Yeah, Charizard. That new team, man. Oh, man, that got a chance."
617.44,622.32," You want to check him out? But like it was, I mean, freaky, he would dress. He would dress as a, uh,"
622.32,625.76," Pikachu. He bought his big Pikachu outfit because he thought he'd drive more business and like,"
625.76,631.44," oh, my god. Oh, dude, it was really weird. He was obsessed with wrestling too. So he would, uh,"
632.48,637.84," there's a go to the back. He would go to, Bobito's got his, he would go to all these, uh,"
637.84,640.88," like he's wrestling events and have like, you know, all like the, like the wrestlers, like"
640.88,645.52," side stuff, we had Stonecall Steve Austin call the store ones, which was pretty funny. But, uh,"
645.6,651.6," I had a boss that was terrible for another job. I was in PR and she's, my car broke down."
651.6,656.24, And so I had to go home that afternoon to kind of get it fixed because I was living in LA need a
656.24,661.36," car now. He really bad, obviously. And so it was like six o'clock. I signed off and she calls me,"
661.36,665.28," she goes, what's dual? They're like, well, I did this and this and that and she goes, well,"
665.28,668.88," let me see what you did. I'm like, what? I want to see evidence that you're really working. I'm like,"
670.0,674.16," no, I'm like, if you don't trust me, I'm never coming back. And like, for 45 minutes, we had a"
674.16,678.3199999999999," conversation about, you know, I'm like, you can't trust me. I've been, I did a company for like six"
678.3199999999999,682.24," months and back and forth and finally she said it's where you're supposed to provide. Like, I don't"
682.24,684.7199999999999," know, like, I was working like, I'm press release or something like that. I'm like, no, I'm like,"
684.7199999999999,688.8," if you don't, which I actually was doing really work, I ain't even in the thing was at lunchtime"
688.8,692.48," because once you take the rest of the day off, I'm like, oh, no, I'll work from home. No, it's no problem."
693.04,696.7199999999999," And it was that was the beginning of that amount of working at that company. That was just,"
696.7199999999999,699.8399999999999," I mean, if I was taking a shit at nine o'clock in the morning and nine o' one, she didn't want"
699.84,704.88, to know why I was in my desk and on a clock is as thoughtful. Wow. I've never had a bad boss. You are
704.88,710.4," lucky. Mother honestly, maybe one, but most of my bosses were awesome. And when I was in high school"
710.4,715.76," and working at seven to eleven, I worked for this dude Joe, who was absolutely amazing. Like, he"
715.76,720.8000000000001," lived in my friends neighborhood and that seemed every Saturday. Big ol, black to pay on his"
720.8000000000001,727.6," on his head and his pale white, pasty skin under the Texas sun, pushing his lawn mower with, you know,"
727.6,733.12," like really short shorts on and a wife beater and socks pulled up to his knees with a little,"
733.12,739.76, what are those guardor belts that you wear? And he hired everyone in my band in high school and we
739.76,745.12," worked the same shift and all we did was take turns, take a nap in the back and how much he"
745.12,750.64," appears from the cooler and dream to that seven eleven go through. Not a lot of whipped cream, but"
750.64,758.16," it's never quite a bit of molecular. I hope that went. If you worked in that range,"
758.16,763.28, you started dairy cooler. Everyone ran back there to do a whip. You see like a career like
763.28,769.6, and that's the euphemism for a bagger and they would hurt us. They'd run back there just like
769.6,774.72," boom, they just grab one like, you know, the big extra tall can, ripped that thing and then sit there"
774.72,779.6," like on the empty milk crates like, and then you call them up, you just like mess them, get on the"
779.6,785.0400000000001," intercom calm. We need order out, please, Eli order out on the on six and four and then run back"
785.0400000000001,790.64, up. Wow. I worked at TCBY for a week. That was fun. What does that would be? It's like today's best
790.64,795.9200000000001," yogurt or the country's best yogurt. Yeah, oh man. I was, I was, and I was awful at the job. I could"
795.9200000000001,799.0400000000001," like, you know, I had to make this like, you know, little things so perfect. I was like, I couldn't,"
799.0400000000001,802.72," I didn't do shit. I started giving away everything my friends and they said, you don't really make"
802.72,806.96," that much money when you're here. I'm like, nope. Sorry, it's just called the country's best yo. Yeah,"
806.96,812.5600000000001, TCBY. Have that around. Is that ever? Yeah. I worked there for the most arrogant fucking name I've ever heard.
813.76,820.24," You know, maybe that's why I don't want an acronym. I mean, so you had to be in the note,"
820.24,824.5600000000001," realize I worked there for one week. That was pretty bad. No, I'll fall at the job for a more"
824.5600000000001,830.24, few million school. That stuff's extinct now. Frozen yogurt? Who's that? It's not actually
830.24,834.72," I can have a college girl. But now you've got like cold stone and you've got like, uh,"
834.8000000000001,839.36," a lot of places and stuff. Well, I can't say it. It's frozen. Yeah."
840.08,845.84, I like cold stone. What's the portions by like 90%. Cold stone portions are like for
845.84,851.52," bovine America. Yeah. Well, you don't have to eat it yourself. You go and you take, you take a woman"
851.52,857.0400000000001, and you get a small and the small could like feed a family of five. It's a gorgeous cream.
857.0400000000001,861.76," Fox. What about what about that thing in LA? There's there's a really like popular, uh,"
861.84,866.24, oh yeah. Frozen yogurt restaurant called was it pinkberry? Yeah. Yeah. That's like they have
866.24,871.68, people like lining out the door to get two different flavors and all it is is like yogurt or green tea
871.68,875.4399999999999, or something. It's called pinkberry. Pinkberry. Yeah. He's right expecting mail could go to a
875.4399999999999,880.48, place. But it's really trendy. They're opening something like that. It's really good. It's just
882.48,886.4, all right. All right. All right. All right. Let me toss out one bossing. We haven't even gotten
886.4,891.4399999999999," to any remote, remotely near games yet. But I just want to one bossing because it does"
891.4399999999999,898.72," I, you remind me of it. I had this one boss in my first publishing job in, uh, in Alameda, California."
898.72,902.9599999999999, It was a computer book publishing place and I'm not in name any names because they're kind of still
902.9599999999999,910.0," around. Um, but the boss of the whole place was this draconian mother fucker. He was this complete"
910.0,915.84," asshole. But my boss, who was under him, was this complete milk toast, spyingless. He was like right"
915.9200000000001,921.2," out of a, out of a cartoon. He's like a cartoon, middle manager. Like he does what do what his, he would,"
922.24,927.2," he could never tell anything, have us do anything that he wanted us to do because we had no"
927.2,932.96, respect for him. But he would always try to come down on us because his boss would tell him to come
932.96,938.64," down on us. So like we would all wander into work like anywhere from 930 to 1030 whatever, you know,"
938.64,944.5600000000001," kind of like we do here. And the big boss would get all like, you know, lick he was, he was, uh,"
944.64,949.92," European dude is like, you know, work starts at 9 o'clock. And when I say 9 o'clock, I'm going to,"
949.92,954.4799999999999, I'm doing a variety of accents here because I don't want to give it away. The guy is Casey's listening.
954.4799999999999,960.9599999999999," Actually, if you're listening, call my head. I had the ball, I had, I said about Steve O for you."
960.9599999999999,966.7199999999999," Yeah, that can't tell me this. I don't want to say this, but, uh, but, uh, you know, he's like,"
966.7199999999999,971.68, they must be at the desk at 9 o'clock. That doesn't mean that they're at the coffee machine at 9 o'clock.
971.68,976.2399999999999, They have to be at their desk working at 9 o'clock. So he tells us to to my boss to our boss.
976.7199999999999,982.88," And so for one day, our boss goes out. His way of dealing with this is he goes out to the front of the building"
983.5999999999999,989.28," with a yellow legal note pad. And as we're all coming in like 45 minutes late, he's got our names."
989.28,992.7199999999999," He's written down our names on this yellow pad and we walked by and he goes, you're late."
994.4799999999999,997.1999999999999," Like, and I walked in with like two other guys and we're like, yeah, we know."
997.76,1000.8, Like that was our answer to him. And that was it. And then we never heard of it again.
1000.8,1005.04," Yeah, I like went to him later on that day. I was like, what was that about? What was it like,"
1005.04,1008.8," your late thing? It's like, well, you guys are supposed to be here at 9 o'clock. You're supposed to be"
1008.8,1014.0," your desk. You know, not at the coffee machine at 9. So I was just like letting you know"
1014.0,1018.56," that that's where you had to be. And so that's what I did. Like, okay, well, that's great."
1018.56,1023.8399999999999," Anyway, see you tomorrow at 10. Right. Do you? So, so one, so, but the story I wanted to tell"
1023.9200000000001,1032.0, about him was that the big boss got it in his head that people were spending too much time
1032.0,1038.48," at work on the phone, not, you know, a non-work calls. And it was pissing him off all the way"
1038.48,1042.72," to time because of people making phone calls. So he wanted everybody to, all the managers to"
1042.72,1046.96, crack down on people talking on the telephone. So this was pretty Internet. So God knows what
1046.96,1052.08, this guy's thinking now. Everybody fucking off on the web all day. But he could not deal with people
1052.1599999999999,1058.8799999999999," talking on the phone. So, so my manager gets the new phone bill. How old are you at this time?"
1058.8799999999999,1065.4399999999998," I was 25. Okay. Okay. So my manager gets the new phone bill that has all of the, all of the"
1065.4399999999998,1070.8799999999999," extensions, you know, history for the last 30 days. Like, who's been on the phone? And there's one"
1070.8799999999999,1076.8799999999999," number on there that's way the hell out of the league of all the others. Like, constantly on the"
1076.88,1081.44," phone. And I'm sitting there in his office with him. And he's like going over the single and like,"
1081.44,1086.24," I can't believe it. I can't believe this. One person's just on the phone all the time. You know,"
1086.24,1090.8000000000002, who is this? What are they doing? I'm working all the time. I'm going to call him. So he picks up his
1090.8000000000002,1096.96, phone. He dials a number and goes busy and figures. And he was calling his phone. He's in the
1096.96,1106.64, fucking his cell. He's fucking number. Oh my God. The phone and work asked your age because
1107.0400000000002,1112.48," when you're working in between like 16 and God, I don't know what 20 or something in your job."
1112.48,1115.5200000000002," There's always that. You know, when you're in your first relationships,"
1115.5200000000002,1119.5200000000002," you can't get the girl off your mind or the vice versa, whatever. Yeah. And it's like, you've got to"
1119.5200000000002,1123.5200000000002," sneak back into that one room where there's a phone and call. See, how are you doing? How are you?"
1124.24,1129.92," So there's always that. But I was going to say, you've never had a bad boss. I've always,"
1129.92,1133.92," I've don't, when I work blue college jobs, I don't think I've ever had a good one. And I know"
1134.0,1138.8000000000002, that that was a feeling that was unanimous for everyone I worked with because they'd sit there all
1138.8000000000002,1143.44," day in most cases. You know, another grocery store where that called Hagen, the Sky was sitting there."
1143.44,1150.48," And we worked a shift from 2 a.m. to like 11 a.m. and all night, he would just be pointing out all"
1150.48,1155.1200000000001, the cricketeries and crankseters that were coming through. And that's where he's the guy I got. He gave
1155.1200000000001,1160.8000000000002," me the expression, the cricketerie for, you know, another word for a methadic. And, uh,"
1161.68,1167.52," crankseters the same thing, chicken heads. And he's the one who also has other meetings. He's a, that's"
1167.52,1175.28," multiple business. Chicken heads, boo heads. But he, he, he, he. So he would just spend the whole night talking"
1175.28,1181.04, about like what harm he was going to do to the store in this fantasy land. So don't get scared. It's
1181.04,1184.8," not, you know, like some kind of shit you're going to see on the news the next night. But it would be"
1184.8,1189.2, in these ideal scenarios where no one's in the store. So no one's going to get hurt or anything.
1189.2,1194.72," But then given that, the sky was the limit. So in in one concoction, he would come right through"
1194.72,1200.0, the wall into the produce section where we worked in a with the bulldozer and just drive straight through
1200.0,1205.52, right across the store and out the pharmacy. And then do a do a 90 degree turn and come in through the
1205.52,1210.0, I'll and then go straight out the meat department and he would have like the exact route. Like it was
1210.0,1214.32," a, like he was at NASCAR GIRE talking about like the line he was going to race when you know when he"
1214.3999999999999,1220.1599999999999, got back to the track the next day. I love you. The eggplant. He was just sitting there that and
1220.1599999999999,1225.36," everything was full like, huh, fool. Huh. Is that where you got that front? I got it for"
1225.36,1231.04," it. Oh, you got a fool. You got to put more cucumber out, fool. Huh, fool. Hey,"
1231.04,1234.8799999999999, like you get your attention. So he was always getting trouble for that because you'd say to someone
1234.8799999999999,1240.32," and they'd get mad like stop calling me fool. He'd be like, calm down fool. I call everyone"
1240.3999999999999,1248.8799999999999," fool. Like, but he couldn't help it. He couldn't help it. To retz. So, hey, so I'll bring it back to you."
1248.8799999999999,1253.9199999999998," Yeah, bring it back to game Sean. Um, just so I'm 20 min away from that in the games. Get surprised."
1253.9199999999998,1257.6799999999998," Yeah, I'm not even going to bother with the smooth transition. I'm just going to change topics."
1257.6799999999998,1261.9199999999998," But we've been getting, you know, we have subscriptions to all the various magazines,"
1261.9199999999998,1267.12," game magazines. And so this is a time of year. Of course, when you get holiday buyers guides"
1267.1999999999998,1271.28," on their ubiquitous, you'll find them in in where they tell you if you like first things"
1271.28,1277.6," from your next by Halo 3. Right. Like like like EGM. Yeah. So exactly. Looking through these,"
1277.6,1281.4399999999998," you know, just sort of like, you know, comparing them reading, you know, looking at one to another,"
1283.04,1286.8, I couldn't help myself. This is one of those times where I wanted to come and cast some stones.
1286.8,1293.04," Have we, have we seen some cross? We've got three. You've got three all the same stuff. It is the same stuff."
1293.04,1296.1599999999999," And he has the rest of the rest of the research. My question. So we're going to, I'm going to have to"
1296.16,1302.48," give away some of the inside, you know, industry dirt in order to make this work. But basically,"
1303.3600000000001,1310.3200000000002," for months and advance of your holiday issue, all, you know, companies that sell anything from"
1310.3200000000002,1315.52," sports jerseys to action figures begin, you know, spamming you with email saying, which is their job."
1315.52,1318.64," Which is right. And that's their job. There's nothing wrong with that at all. You know, hey,"
1318.64,1323.3600000000001, we'll send you this. Keep us in mind for the holiday for your holiday buyers guide. And
1324.24,1328.24," what happens is, and they do the job. Some of them obviously do the jobs well. When you see the same,"
1328.24,1334.6399999999999," you know, useless item in six different magazines all the same time with nearly identical writeups."
1334.6399999999999,1339.36," So what happens though, maybe not just useless. They're like beyond useless. I mean,"
1339.36,1344.24," they're just like, just please don't jump. They are shit. And it's over-priced. It's kind of stuff that,"
1344.24,1350.32," you know, the seasonal aisle at any drugstore. And you walked through it and the whole aisle was like jibbering and like"
1350.32,1357.84," blabbering at you like, like, and then as you proceed down that aisle, there's just like,"
1357.84,1362.3999999999999," nose clippers, right? And it's like a great gift, a great stocking stuff. There's like, no, it's not."
1362.3999999999999,1368.1599999999999, Right. And these were that stuff. And these were that with like geek subculture attached to it.
1368.1599999999999,1372.56," So any Batman, any excuse that you could possibly find to put in your magazine."
1372.56,1376.6399999999999," Now what happens though, in the worst case scenario, a magazine staff will say,"
1377.44,1383.1200000000001," this is a lot of free shit. And free shit's good shit. So what we can do is just say,"
1383.1200000000001,1387.68," yes, to all these things. And they'll send it all in. And then, you know, what happens is then,"
1387.68,1392.24," I'm maybe not literally. I'm imagining though that it all gets put in a pile and everyone says,"
1392.24,1395.2800000000002," I get this and then the conditions are, yeah, you could take that if you want, you just got"
1395.2800000000002,1402.5600000000002," a right 10 words about it. And in some cases in these guides, I mean, it's ridiculous to the extent"
1402.56,1406.72," that there are just pictures. Like, let me Robert Kibar, this one from you. Yes. So I'm not"
1406.72,1408.48, going to send it as me. I'm not going to send it as me. I'm not going to send it as me. I'm not going to
1408.48,1410.48, send it as me. I'm not going to send it as me. I'm not going to send it as me. I'm not going to send it as me.
1410.48,1415.36," Robert's made it as less here. I wouldn't have named the same. Yeah. The source of videos. But so for this,"
1415.36,1422.48," for example, this one, you look, and you see, you know, like 12 games. And you see the name of the game,"
1422.48,1428.0, and then you see the price of the game. But you see nothing else. That is literally all there is. So here's a page with
1428.0,1432.16," some games. It's like, come on, do best buy gives me more information than this. That actually"
1432.16,1436.64," in a grocery store. That does look like a, it looks like an ad. Yeah. Like a best buy. Right."
1436.64,1443.12," And Robert and I both freelance, we did a best buy, I was guy before I worked at CGW before that"
1443.12,1450.32, became on GFW. And we provided better advice with the art like 10 word blurb's for each of these.
1450.32,1457.6," Then then anyone even bothers here. So it's like, look, we got SmackDown versus RAW. And on the"
1457.6,1463.76," same page, then there's, you know, what, siphon filter, filters, the 3 version too. Don't forget the"
1463.76,1471.28," PS3 version. Okay. Right across from the PS2 version. Nice. So that's, that is bad because it's absolutely"
1471.28,1476.08," useless. So there's no, there's no editorial. And is there someone in the world who sees this and that"
1476.08,1480.7199999999998," at least is a game. You're like, okay, maybe this is or feel the Vex Ortiz. But say you see a picture of a"
1480.7199999999998,1486.0," USB cannon. And you're like, dude, there's a picture that in the magazine of course. And mining."
1486.64,1491.92," You're seeing a magazine. Can I theorize here? In fact, in that one thing with not even 10 words"
1491.92,1496.88," there, like, that is your job. Right. I mean, come on. Let's look at what the fuck let's look at when"
1496.88,1502.32," there's words. Here's an example. Jets shirts. We, we know because they sent a box to us on Succeed."
1502.32,1509.28," Uh-huh. And we, by the way, that we threw them away. Oh, well, we give them away. I was given away."
1509.28,1513.52," We give them like the IT people and stuff. Yeah. I mean, but so the text is, I can't people and homeless"
1513.68,1519.6," for jinx shirts is that jinx offers a huge variety of t-shirts, sweaters and hats for men, women and children."
1520.16,1525.84," Yeah. Okay. So they did like saying McDonald's offers calories. Wait, what are the other one from the one you"
1525.84,1530.8," showed me earlier? Okay. Other from the other blur. Now, that one right there clearly was a copy and"
1530.8,1534.6399999999999," pace from a press release. Right. Now, here's when you give it more words. Say you're going to give"
1534.6399999999999,1541.2," something fit. The other thing about this too, which is this specific item, will allow me to dress"
1541.28,1546.16," as the pricing. These are things that they're so out of touch with. For what, who do they imagine?"
1546.16,1549.1200000000001," You have to imagine if you're, I assume if you're going to make one of these. And this is the reason"
1549.1200000000001,1554.24, why we don't make these. Shift W's never made one. It's because you need to identify who's your audience.
1554.24,1558.96, Right. Is it a buyer's guide for people to give to other people? This is what I want. Right.
1558.96,1563.6000000000001, Help them decide what to buy for so-and-else. But everything is so exorbitantly priced.
1563.6000000000001,1569.1200000000001, And not so it's a perfect combination of uselessness and overpricing. So here we have Mitchell and
1569.4399999999998,1576.4799999999998, this throwback jerseys for $300. And what I'm looking at here is a picture of a shirt with a number on it.
1576.4799999999998,1583.84, Okay. And for this we get pioneers in sportswear fashion. Mitchell and this has been around for over a
1583.84,1591.52, century proving quality stitching made from superior materials. It's no wonder that the company is so
1591.52,1598.4799999999998," widely respected. Oh my fucking god. We respect that. Oh, no. I don't know what you're not saying anything."
1598.56,1603.84, I'm saying maybe dust don't say anything. So stitching. Like now you were in video games now you're a
1603.84,1610.24, fucking connoisseur and like stitching. It's better out what that is. Like it hepatitis has been around
1610.24,1614.96," from millennia. That means it's good. You know, these guys have been making this shit for over 50 years."
1615.68,1622.64," And then okay, we especially like the selection of licensed NBA NHL NFL and NFL B throwback jerseys."
1622.64,1626.32, You'll be able to feel what we're talking about when you try one of these on for yourself.
1627.28,1631.76," Wow, that's awful. So I don't think, but I wonder is it really about, you know, getting a bunch of"
1631.76,1637.4399999999998, free stuff or is it? How often are you holding on? Or is it after the holiday rush? And they're staring
1637.4399999999998,1643.28, down the however many pages exactly. The fact that they got the love and it's November and they're going to go
1643.28,1648.48," got eight pages to feel. They're like, hmm. All the buyers guy threw throwback jerseys looking like some"
1648.48,1652.96," good stuff to write about. Right. I don't know. I don't know about you guys, but when I come to have"
1652.96,1657.6000000000001," extra pages, I want to give a reader something actually they can't ever shit about or we'd rather give them a"
1657.6000000000001,1662.64, couple extra. That's why you get different than GFW. We don't give a fuck.
1664.4,1669.68," That mental you know, I'm getting brown my god. Those section editors, so we know that every month"
1669.68,1673.8400000000001," you're faced with, you know, just a little limited every every no matter what, you're always,"
1673.8400000000001,1678.64," you know, we don't have the many pages as you want. But you also say, I want you, I need something to"
1678.64,1682.72," fill these pages. And this is ready. Well, Sean, you're just taking her earlier. You're just taking her earlier."
1682.72,1686.5600000000002," You're artists. Hey, here. I got a bunch of JPEGs. Could you put them on this page here some price tags?"
1686.5600000000002,1691.76, Right. You don't know. Is that your freaking iPhone or whatever that shit is like no shit and iPhone's
1691.76,1696.96," fucking popular. Right. That's, that's the most possible. Yeah. It's like, can you be obvious?"
1696.96,1702.4," Yeah. What's, what's, what's not? What I can't, what I think Sean, one year earlier points"
1702.4,1707.0400000000002," is absolutely dead on, which is like, who are these for this is always my problem with doing these."
1707.12,1712.08," And in fact, even if it's game related, even if it's games to do a buyer's guide, because I sort of"
1712.08,1716.96," feel like, you know, who, who is read, I mean, this is just obvious, but who's reading a gaming"
1716.96,1721.84," magazine other than a hardcore gamer. So why are you writing an article in which like, you know,"
1721.84,1726.56," for the sports gamer in your life? I mean, really, that's you. Right. I mean, you're the one reading"
1726.56,1731.36," the magazine. We should probably just be writing these articles for you. Yeah. You know, not for some"
1731.36,1735.76, mythical person that's reading this magazine that's actually shopping for someone else who does that
1735.76,1740.48," on that like sports, they're going to like this shirt with a number on it. Yeah. And I think though,"
1740.48,1744.8799999999999, it's both. They want it. It's an easy way to fill the page and people want the free shit. I'd say
1744.8799999999999,1749.36," evidence for people wanting the free stuff is when you see, look at the prices on here. We have a"
1749.36,1755.36," Lego, Millennium Falcon for $500. We have a hero clicks, action, scare for $250. This is my"
1755.36,1759.36," new, I've been told, does not even available to the public any longer, but the thing about this"
1759.36,1765.2," is, it's, it's about, you know, what, $2.50 worth of materials and 18 cents for labor,"
1765.76,1770.32," and you have this thing here. And no one wants it. No one, it shouldn't have been made. It"
1770.32,1776.0," should have been built with a trash can around it. You know, I mean, it's just like, that's carry."
1776.0,1781.36," That's carry case is the garbage can. Romantic the middle man of the person. Or this, Star Wars,"
1781.36,1786.08," Echoes, Huddies, $100. The weather's getting cold again, and it's time to start wearing some"
1786.08,1791.6," warmer clothes. I mean, Jeff did better job selling a fucking hammer than this. You got some nails,"
1791.6,1798.32, but can you point it? Can you point it? Can you point it? Can you point it? Can you point out that
1798.32,1803.28," hoodie is boba fit? The hoodie is boba fit. Yeah, because that's how I want to look when it gets"
1803.28,1807.1999999999998, what do you pull that side? You bump into a pie. You put the hood up and you look like a boba fit.
1807.1999999999998,1811.1999999999998," Look at the size of the fact you're 100 pounds. Sure, so that is cool."
1811.1999999999998,1815.6," Steve, I would love to wear that. Since sci-fi fans are generally known for their fashion"
1815.6,1819.36," sense, Mark Eck, it was here to help. Help you get punched in the front and face."
1821.36,1826.08," So here's another example of the apps, what I'm convinced is the absolute insincereity of these"
1826.08,1830.9599999999998," recommendations. When we have the ever quest to, I think anyone's going to argue that they're sincere"
1830.9599999999998,1837.76," that you're fighting. Why is every magazine he holds in doing it? Well, I mean, I mean, he's"
1837.76,1843.28," a holiday buyer's guy, but he would very differently. We do it very differently than the these guys."
1843.36,1848.3999999999999," Oh, here's the iPod, you're right. I'm just, I was just going to say every magazine does it because"
1848.3999999999999,1856.24," every magazine does it, man. The holiday is there a time of tradition. Not just in what you put"
1856.24,1862.08," up in your living room, but not just in the game magazines, but all magazines and publications"
1862.08,1868.56, turn out these lame holiday things that they do every fucking year because people get lazy right
1868.56,1873.28," about November and they start just, you know, okay, what are we doing this year to fill some"
1873.28,1879.6," pages? Seriously, look at time magazine. I get it. I'll tell you that that's saddens me that people"
1879.6,1884.1599999999999," are doing holiday guys just because they don't, they have these pages filled in their lazy. Like,"
1884.1599999999999,1888.24," there's so many, like, I don't know, maybe just me, I feel like there's so many more opportunities"
1888.24,1893.6," for so many things that you want to do. But it's like Jesus Christ, man, go do something"
1893.6,1898.32," it. It goes from something else like, you know, totally, if that argument holds up against this,"
1898.32,1902.7199999999998," that ever quest to comic book creators. Oh, and there is no one to sing. That's available now."
1903.6,1908.6399999999999," Okay, it's three got Brian's gift. It's $30, right? Now, these things are, I say,"
1909.36,1914.9599999999998," unsolicited in our mailboxes more often than like credit card offers, right? We get that. I swear,"
1914.9599999999998,1920.3999999999999, there's a stack of these things that are been in the bosobin to send to unsuspecting freelancers or whatever
1920.4,1924.5600000000002," in lieu of actual payment. We actually use it in the matter. David, I've been wondering when"
1924.5600000000002,1930.48," I was going to give my deck. I just keep on getting an ever quest comic book creator. So, look,"
1930.48,1938.3200000000002," it's 2007, right? With that in mind, someone's like, dude, for $30, I can press Prince Green on"
1938.3200000000002,1943.8400000000001," fucking ever quest? Yes, dude. I want to. What is it? I don't understand. Look at, let's see."
1944.64,1948.4, Everyone going to really amaze and quest in which you can share your epic story with the world
1948.4,1954.88," and comic book form? Now, you can. And since you can import your screenshots, nothing stop"
1954.88,1960.4," and you're making this into the World of Warcraft comic book. Well, yeah. So, I mean,"
1961.6000000000001,1967.2800000000002," that one really hurt my brain. Well, that one hurt, right? That's a bit of an entire thing,"
1967.2800000000002,1971.8400000000001," because you're right. That's one of those, like, suspect things that does show up as spam in our mailbox"
1971.8400000000001,1976.88," with the viagres and the lower your mortgage payments. I got an email, take for a dual toilet,"
1976.88,1980.0, so I can take a shit next to my wife. I'm all excited about that. That's how it goes.
1980.8000000000002,1984.4," Yeah. It's not a good idea. You know, it's like, maybe the old Saturday live skate where they have"
1984.4,1988.72," the dual toilet, like, that's where they got, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Was that a gag gift or what?"
1988.72,1992.72," No, it was a really, it was a really, you know, it got to what I want to do that. I don't have some people who"
1992.72,1996.3200000000002, want to share all in. And apparently it's good for the environment. That was what their other
1996.3200000000002,2001.3600000000001," things was good for that. That's not a right, man. That's a great time. Some people are, you know,"
2001.36,2007.1999999999998," closer to their wives than you. I know I'm very close to my, and my wife is French, and, you know,"
2007.1999999999998,2011.6799999999998," it took me a while to get, you see, even just when we were going out, going out before we were married,"
2011.6799999999998,2016.4799999999998," that I would be in the bathroom, and I'm just, you know, I was nothing that serious going on."
2016.4799999999998,2022.9599999999998," And she just like, walk in and I'm like, hey, excuse me, but because she's like, in Europe,"
2022.9599999999998,2027.12," they're just like, you know, what's your problem? I've seen that before, and I've seen what you're"
2027.12,2032.0," doing before. So no big deal on the street. Oh shit. Yeah, they, they have no hang up that way."
2032.0,2037.36," That's just brought a story. Oh, yeah. Can I, can I, I'll let you talk to her. But let me tell you,"
2037.36,2041.76," let me just about to get someone watching me pee Jeff. Oh, thank you. We get a"
2041.76,2048.24," by a cell. Okay. Someone watching you pee. Okay. Go for it. You ever seen, you know, Buffalo 66?"
2048.7999999999997,2054.16," No, I know what it is. Christina, that movie with what's his face is that we could divert,"
2054.24,2058.8799999999997," that's, that's like an extra off topic inside of the atop. But that's another great movie."
2058.8799999999997,2064.56," And I love it. But the whole thing starts off, and it's very Kubrickian in that it's very much about"
2064.56,2068.8799999999997," someone trying to control their world and minimize, you know, exigen season stuff, but having no"
2068.8799999999997,2074.0," ability to do it. So they, the guy starts off, and it's all embodied in the fact that he has to take a"
2074.0,2077.44," elite. He just got out of jail, right? Where his whole world's controlled. Then he has to take a"
2077.44,2081.68," leak. The one thing that he could choose to do, he can't do. He goes in a restaurant, so they're like,"
2081.68,2085.6," you have to be a diner here, get out. He finally goes, and it just builds up so that 30 minutes"
2085.6,2089.6," in your like, God damn, I just want him to take a leak. I feel for him. And then when he finally goes,"
2089.6,2093.68," someone's checking his unit out, and then it fucks him up, and he can't leak. Oh, man."
2093.68,2098.3999999999996," Zips up punches the guy or something, and it runs out. But anyway, I was on the part, and I think"
2099.12,2104.08," which is the barrier rapid transit on a name check it, and there's this dude looking at me,"
2104.08,2107.8399999999997," and I was, you know, in my mind, I was like, what's the dude want? Like, he, this guy,"
2107.84,2111.76," got some trouble with me or something, and I was thinking like, he wants, he's like a challenging"
2111.76,2116.2400000000002," stare, right? So I look back at him now, and then like, fucking mind your own business, you know,"
2116.2400000000002,2120.32," and that went on for a while, and then I thought, I stopped noticing him, and I thought nothing"
2120.32,2124.1600000000003," of it, and then you know, I get off of my stop, and I go to use the bathroom at the"
2124.1600000000003,2128.8," part at the North Worth. So this was pre 9, 11. No, this was after. This was an"
2128.8,2132.4," arc of a bump in the muck again. Like last year, the restaurants were closed for a long time. They're"
2132.4,2136.48," open again. Okay. And so thank God, I'm starting to go in, and it's a single use"
2136.48,2140.8," scrapper, you know, like you go in there, and there's just like a scrapper. And so I'm going in,"
2140.8,2144.96," and I turn around, and I hear the door, and like a hand reaches in and stops it. And I look,"
2144.96,2150.0," and it's the same dude from the train, and at that point, like I was already had my pants down,"
2150.4,2154.0," and that's where I was like, what are you doing? You were reading the signals. And then he was like,"
2154.0,2157.84," yeah, he was like, still coming in. I was like, get the fuck out, man. And then he like went,"
2158.4,2162.64," and then like, then I came out and looked, it's like dude, and it was Larry Craig. Was it just"
2162.64,2167.68," something where this guy had to go real bad and didn't know that it was a unit joint. And I looked,"
2167.68,2172.08," and he was getting back down to go on the train again. It wasn't even his stop. But that was, you read the"
2172.08,2175.2799999999997," signals. You thought he was giving you a glare. I read it wrong. Yeah, they check it in the"
2175.2799999999997,2181.04," picture. He tapped you with this foot. Oh, yeah, you did. Yeah, you did. I didn't mean to be a"
2181.04,2184.56," dick to him if I said it in the wrong single, but it was like weird, because it's like,"
2185.6,2191.52," don't come in here, man. So not only are you a bully, your T's. No. And John Elliott is such a"
2191.6,2193.2, cockty.
2195.2,2200.48," When we use that word, we mean in the chicken sense. Just so we don't get censored by anyone."
2200.48,2206.96," So okay, no, no, go back. Okay. I just want to get the, I noticed in one of these magazines here,"
2206.96,2211.6," there was a, it was one of those T shirts. It was the Kate. It said, Kate, thanks, buy on it."
2211.6,2217.7599999999998," Okay, yeah, first of all. Here you go. Let's find you this. You know, you could find any, any old"
2217.84,2221.84," internet meme. And there's going to be a shirt of it. But it's just from my, when I see this shirt,"
2221.84,2226.32," it reminds me that of the weekend when I was hanging out with my daughter, and we were talking about"
2227.36,2233.5200000000004," music, which I do a lot with her, because I've got like hundreds and hundreds of CDs and I've been"
2233.5200000000004,2239.2000000000003," a musician for a long time, a music is a very important part of my life. And it is just killing me."
2240.32,2244.88," It's just killing me right now. I'm laughing because these guys pointed to shirt out to me. It says,"
2244.88,2253.84, don't tease unless you can please. I get every question that you need to wear that on Bart every
2253.84,2259.12," day. I think that's a cell phone. Yeah, it's a cell phone wallpaper. Okay, so it's killing me right now"
2259.12,2266.96," that that because my daughter's 13, none of the music I like can possibly be cool to her. And if she likes,"
2266.96,2272.0," if it's something that she likes, and I acknowledge I like it too, it's over for her. So the"
2272.0,2275.6," later, you do that to make her have good music taste. Every time she puts in like Levitah"
2275.6,2280.8," Locke or something, just go around and how singin it. Yeah, I could do that. I can't, I'm not allowed to sing"
2280.8,2284.8," it. I mean, she sings that milkshake song. You're like, oh, that is the best song. She was playing,"
2284.8,2289.12," she was playing something by a spoon. You know, and you bands, Boons. And I said, oh, I really like"
2289.12,2294.4," spoon, and it pissed her off because now I, because now spoons, I'm cool. And I said, what their cool,"
2294.4,2301.12," and what she said back to me was, they're not cool once you know who they are, dad. So that's"
2301.2,2304.96," the right, right, it made me think about like when a magazine, when a print magazine is"
2304.96,2309.52," telling you to buy a shirt that says, K, thanks, buy on it. Oh, it's officially that means the mean"
2309.52,2315.12," is now over by the time you order this shirt, this thing is, you know, first of all, by the time"
2315.12,2320.24," it's even on a shirt, it's over. But then by the time a print magazine recognizes it's on a shirt,"
2320.24,2324.72, it's way off. I'm very much in agreement with Malcolm Gladwell on the journalist and he wrote
2326.08,2329.6," a link and what's the other one that I'm taking a tipping point, but in which he examines, you know,"
2329.92,2334.48," the life cycles of trends and he pauses to Thursdays, different, you know, different people"
2334.48,2339.04," associated with different parts of the life cycle, you know, those that introduced it early adopters,"
2339.04,2344.3199999999997," middle adopters and stuff. But by the time you get to the magazine that has trying to sell it to you,"
2344.3199999999997,2349.8399999999997, you've gotten to past even the majority adopters. And that's exactly when something is no longer
2349.8399999999997,2356.3199999999997," cool. So it's sort of like just a sociological way of saying this thing. But yeah, I agree with it."
2356.32,2362.2400000000002, It's like a dad telling you we like spoon for the way. All cats all that stuff mean is way way past the
2363.6000000000004,2370.0800000000004," pet past the majority adopters phase. Very uncool. All cats. Yeah, which is funny because I just"
2370.0800000000004,2376.0," had my 12 year old niece send me an email saying, have you seen these wall cats? They're so funny."
2376.0,2377.36, Wall.
2379.6800000000003,2384.4," Yeah, I'm expecting to get one from my dad any day. Then they could come back eventually with irony,"
2384.7200000000003,2389.44, like there was the arguing on the special Olympics. Are you going to an internet like winning
2389.44,2392.56, or competing in the special Olympics? How can I even get this wrong?
2392.56,2398.32, It was a JPEG that you post up and it was show a person with down syndrome breaking the barrier
2398.32,2403.76, in a relay race or something. And it became the dumbest thing ever to the point where
2404.8,2410.7200000000003, to even introduce it into a message board argument made you lose instantly. But then I was able to
2410.72,2415.4399999999996, bring it back in the form of ideal postures mouth that was my all-to-count where people were
2415.4399999999996,2419.7599999999998," making fun of them. And I brought it back and I was like, I tried to because honors this thing."
2419.7599999999998,2424.0, I tried to kick it with composure. I fucked that me more in disclosure.
2424.0,2430.3999999999996," No, he was like, you know, I was trying to keep my cool here and you guys forced this on me."
2431.2,2434.7999999999997, You forced me to do this and bring out the big guns. Then I did get to that big.
2435.52,2439.2799999999997," So like that was like, I thought that was a legitimate. I'm making excuses for myself. But that's"
2439.28,2444.8, made a legit bit funny. That was a good way to use it. Yeah. I don't know. I didn't give it
2444.8,2450.0, moment. I think that something is cool and uncool. Cool and uncool and very different anymore.
2450.0,2456.4," Could be cool today, uncool tomorrow, whatever. I mean, are the BG's cool today or are they uncool?"
2456.4,2461.6800000000003, Who knows? I think they're true. I think the BG's were always cool. I think pretty much.
2461.6800000000003,2465.36," Except for that whole time when we thought they weren't cool. But like, we're a search and pepper"
2465.92,2471.44," only hard to club band movie featuring the BG's is pretty terrible. But see, it might be cool now, though."
2471.44,2479.1200000000003," That's in an ironic way. Yeah, man. Fact. Fact. I did anyone actually see that movie other than me."
2479.1200000000003,2491.1200000000003," I have the theater. Oh, no. I was I was just dating. I was still making my parents lives hell."
2491.2,2495.04, What's freaking to me now is never mind. Scooter that point. Let's move on.
2495.04,2498.56, It's a fun. I'm going to go off onto 70's rant never mind. The final rant about the
2498.56,2502.96, BG's guys is that when you'll see these big ticket items and there will be a single one and even if
2502.96,2508.64," it's remotely related, like say a high definition television. There's just one. And if you wonder"
2508.64,2514.0," if you're a reader and you're wondering, hey, maybe they've done all the hard work for me and they"
2514.0,2519.92," can hear them all. And then this is the one I need to buy. Actually, no, this is the one that someone"
2520.0,2524.64, sent them. Yeah. And they're writing about because someone sent them. Right. The final thing.
2526.7200000000003,2530.8," Psychology of it's very similar to Christmas. You know, I mean, Grandma gives you something and the very"
2530.8,2535.84, least you got to do is to hold it up and show everyone. So that's what happens when you see a picture
2535.84,2541.12," and just the price tag. That's you holding up Grandma's uh, picture and whatever. And then sometimes"
2541.12,2544.8," you really, you got to like say something obligatory about. And that's when you comment on the quality of the"
2544.88,2553.84," stitching. That's that. Yes. Anyway, look for GFW's buyer's guide. Next issue, when we"
2553.84,2560.1600000000003, run out of shit to write about. Yes. But we'll have tested all those products. What else we got to
2560.1600000000003,2566.1600000000003," talk about, Sean? We have any actually leaning talk this week. We've been here and we've got Robert"
2566.1600000000003,2572.0800000000004, Barbito. They're both as much console gamers as PC gamers. I'm definitely more comfortable guys for
2572.08,2577.52, I said in and when I do I said right in the heart. Not really a PC gamer. I think it's safe to say.
2577.52,2582.72," No, I just know I can't make the commitment. I still have the money to buy new rig. Do you know"
2582.72,2588.16," what your you're on foot in the door because you know, uh, I'm a believer. Well, Orange Box has made"
2588.16,2594.08," open my eyes to do many things as Jeff can uh, he did touch about uh, Orange Box on. I think it's the greatest"
2594.08,2597.52," pride. I think it's the aim of the year. But if you're playing, it's game the same fortress you're playing"
2597.6,2601.92," in an Xbox live. Yeah, which is sad because I know you guys it's a whole different community."
2601.92,2607.36," It's played, I mean, just, that's where it's really at 14 fortress 2 because it's just so kind of broken"
2607.36,2613.36, right now on 360 because there's so much lag and not definitely enough players. It's kind of sad.
2613.36,2618.64," I like, well, Bosnia, I understand Halo 3 is great. Multiplayer. I understand it's a great game."
2618.64,2622.08," And I understand called the four has, you know, a certain following, which I don't understand why"
2622.16,2629.84," from multiplayer. But um, team fortress 2 is so good. So good and introduce us so many new things to"
2629.84,2634.7999999999997," console multiplayer experience. I just don't understand why people aren't trying it. Like, I just"
2634.7999999999997,2638.7999999999997," just, I'm just really shocked when I go online and I see there's not enough games. It's hard to"
2638.7999999999997,2643.04," fill a game with them. People why imagine on a PC game, you're just like fighting to get in"
2643.04,2646.7999999999997," an open game. Yeah, I think it just doesn't have the, you know, it doesn't have that history,"
2646.7999999999997,2651.52," you know, it just doesn't have the built-in community the way the way the valve games do on the"
2651.52,2656.16," PC. Yeah. I mean, I think, I think they probably could have done a better job of explaining it to"
2656.16,2661.44," the console audience, like, what it's all about because you'd get even though it's a really intuitive"
2661.44,2666.48," game. And it's not like each class is full of tons of stuff that you have to learn. I mean,"
2666.48,2671.2," this buys complex, but, but, I mean, they don't really introduce you to the idea that you're a part"
2671.2,2677.28," of this team. You pick a class because it does something specific. You need to, you know, learn your"
2677.28,2681.1200000000003, part and play your part. They don't really explain that to you. And so people get in there and
2681.1200000000003,2684.96," just start death matching. Well, that's, that I was going to say that's the problem is that people"
2684.96,2688.7200000000003," yeah, console gamers are so used to, audience, go kill everybody. They don't, they don't,"
2689.92,2692.88," do well with like, okay, I'm going to play a role. Like, you know, a medic, like,"
2692.88,2696.0800000000004," came at people want to play a medic in a console game, like, they're not going to do that."
2696.0800000000004,2700.7200000000003," No back nine years ago, though, to when team fortress and even longer, when, you know,"
2700.7200000000003,2705.28," when the first quake team fortress model came out, PC gamers were very much used to nothing, but death"
2706.2400000000002,2711.6000000000004," and some CPF. And yet, when the mod came out and other, you know, mods like, you know,"
2711.6000000000004,2716.32, science and industry is a classic complicated half-life one mod where you'd actually your team would
2716.32,2721.92, research various technology that would allow you to get access to weapons and stuff like that.
2721.92,2727.36," When you look at natural selection and asymmetrical game mod, you know, where you're one side's"
2727.36,2731.44," aliens, one side's humans and the aliens are not like broods, you know, where they're not humans"
2731.44,2735.6," with guns, they're like creepy crawlies and stuff. And all those games were just released with,"
2735.6,2740.88," without tutorials, without anything, and they somehow managed, I mean, because I, maybe,"
2740.88,2744.48," I don't know, I can't argue that because they were more hardcore somehow than the person who"
2744.48,2748.16," plays Halo for 30 hours a week, you know, I mean, so that's an interesting difference."
2748.16,2753.04," I think, you know, I think, proliferated without any introduction or any explanation of what"
2753.04,2757.52," the fuck was going on. The difference, that's true. Yeah. The difference to me is what else do you do on a PC?"
2757.52,2761.84," You write term papers, what else do you do on a television? You watch the flavor of love."
2761.84,2770.16," So, wait, what is shot with that? It's that simple. You know, like, it's quite a bit there."
2770.16,2776.0," You know, you're still there PC and you're engaged in something that might, you know, take a little"
2776.0,2784.32, more effort. You could also be using your PC to play solitaire or look at porn and you could
2784.4,2791.28," be watching. Yeah. I can be watching. Yeah. 26 hour, you know,"
2791.28,2797.28, which role many history marathons on history channel. It's simple. Yeah. But I think there are
2797.28,2801.84," differences in the communities and another thing that you know, that's what drives me nuts this week."
2801.84,2807.2000000000003," They'll write is the, uh, yeah, is this the hate speech on Xbox Live. I'm not saying that, you know,"
2807.2000000000003,2812.56," PC gaming is free from, you know, hate speech. Good God. It does not. But if you look at the, at the video,"
2812.64,2816.64," and of course, it's stacked because it's a compilation of it. Right. It did, it drew it"
2816.64,2820.64, to my experience. I've spent plenty of time on Xbox Live and plenty of time on one of the PC games.
2821.52,2827.6, It's much more common in my experience at least on Xbox Live. There is no doubt that the reason
2827.6,2832.32," I mean, like, I will not, I will not play games with strangers anymore online. I just don't. I just,"
2832.32,2836.7999999999997," I just, I just won't. I mean, I'll play, if I play, hey, little three, I'll play with the guys here. If I"
2836.7999999999997,2841.2799999999997," play mad and I'll play with, like, Luke Smith, only personal play. I only play French. Driving that's how"
2841.36,2846.88," immature online gaming is. It's very, it's an immature world. What's your take? Oh,"
2846.88,2852.4," as for, in your recent time with Xbox Live? Yeah, I don't know. You know, I think you put a microphone"
2852.4,2860.96," in front of somebody and the first thing they're going to say is, you know, like, there's just,"
2860.96,2866.96," it's just, it's like, it's like, once they realize that they can intrude upon your experience"
2867.04,2872.32," in some way, you know, it just becomes like part of the aggression of playing an online game for"
2872.32,2875.76," people. And then they get pro tips on how to do it from Sean Elliott. I mean, on your"
2875.76,2882.08," tip on our podcast. You do it for insults. What's not necessarily something different,"
2882.08,2887.36," like, I mean, people, I have heard compare what I do to bullying. And, you know, I was trying to"
2887.36,2891.28," defend it, say, no, bullying is not what I do. Bullying would be the equivalent of when you take"
2892.2400000000002,2896.32," someone and you're like, like, dude, why is your dick so small? Why is your dick so small?"
2896.32,2900.8," Pushing a few times? No, why is your dick so small, dude? You know, or more like, what are,"
2900.8,2904.4," you know, and you start, start doing something like that. You know, you pick on someone and you're"
2904.4,2909.6800000000003," specifically exploiting some insecurity. They have some difference or something like that. Whereas,"
2910.6400000000003,2915.52," I mean, you know, some people think it's indefensible. My mind is the difference between that and say,"
2915.52,2920.4, finding discovering that when my helicopter's loaded with teammates and I ram it into a friendly
2920.48,2924.88," tank, the team kills our counter against the tank driver rather than me that helicopter pilot."
2924.88,2929.36," And we can all punish him, which gets him kicked immediately from the server. That's like,"
2929.36,2935.12," both me experimenting with the way that the game is designed. It's also having fun, but it's any"
2935.12,2940.1600000000003," of these rational. It's not like saying, like, let's get this dude because I think he might be gay."
2940.1600000000003,2943.92," Let's get him out of this server. It's like, hey, here's a random dude driving the tank. This is"
2943.92,2948.32," funny because he's just driving a tank. And it's not the same for me. I, I've constantly say this,"
2948.4,2952.4," hey, if someone's walking by the street and I got a bag of milk and hot dog chunks and I'm like,"
2952.4,2956.4, this will be funny to throw on someone. I don't do that. I don't just throw it on someone who walks
2956.4,2960.32," by, right? Because I think, you know, getting kicked because the stakes are different. That's literally"
2960.32,2965.04," humiliating, right? It's, I mean, if someone were to throw some shit on you on the street, it's,"
2965.04,2969.1200000000003," you know, it's upsetting and they're very real consequences. You got to go clean up in this net."
2969.1200000000003,2973.1200000000003," In the game, I got kicked from a server. Like, you just join again. You go to another one, you know?"
2973.1200000000003,2976.88," So it's like, I don't do it. Oh, so what? I know you do. And I haven't really talked"
2976.96,2982.56," about this, but what is your motivation for this? Because I understand like, you do go out and"
2982.56,2986.8," have, like, to have, quote, quote, fun with people. What, what are you, what are you really"
2986.8,2992.48, getting out of it? Besides just kind of pissing people off? Do you think it's fun? It just makes
2992.48,2997.76," me laugh when it happens. And it like, I mean, but don't, you know, I know how much I love you,"
2997.76,3002.56," but I mean, don't you think you're part of the problem? I don't think it's the same. I think it"
3002.56,3006.48," could be a part of a problem, but I think it's not the same. Like, say again, if I'm in a server,"
3006.48,3011.6," I'm doing, you know, like a character or something, a Ralphie character. And now at least Robert and Jeff"
3011.6,3015.6," have heard it. You know, it's not the same as these guys that are calling out someone whose name is"
3015.6,3021.76," gay boy. I do agree. I do agree. It's gay. You know, like, yeah, I'm super charged terms over and over again,"
3021.76,3028.4," you know? I agree. But you are, I mean, at the same time, you are still kind of, you're not being as harsh"
3028.4,3033.2," as maybe someone saying gay boy would ever. But for my experience listening to Sean now,"
3033.2,3039.04," what it seems to me is more like he's kind of, I mean, he, on one hand, you could say he's"
3039.04,3043.12," being an asshole. But on the other hand, I think actually what he's doing is he's ferooting out the"
3043.12,3050.24," assholes. He, he, he, he sort of throws these things out here. And the real assholes are the ones who"
3050.24,3056.3999999999996, respond to him. And then Sean just baits them more. So that's the voice stuff is always there. So he kind of
3056.3999999999996,3060.16," calling out the guys who are likely to call other people retars. Yeah, someone is like,"
3060.16,3063.52," can't, can't, can't you be quiet? I'm just trying to play. They're no fun to mess with. Yeah."
3063.52,3066.96," It's the guy that immediately starts screaming, dude, you're so like, you go to dick in your throat."
3066.96,3072.96, That's the guy that's exactly the guy that's saying you're looking for that. You're looking for the
3072.96,3074.7999999999997," closet. Yeah, but not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm"
3074.7999999999997,3083.3599999999997," punishing a video game. Yeah, I think mostly you're, you're trying to create a surreal experience"
3083.3599999999997,3089.12," for other people. I mean, I kind of dig that, you know, something in me would like to go online and play a"
3089.2,3094.16, game and run into some kid who keeps on talking about how his grandmother got him a video game.
3094.16,3100.16, So you can make friends and have this like really weird experience that you never really have. It reminds
3100.16,3104.7999999999997," me of stuff like, you know, you hear about that group in New York who is put it, you know,"
3104.7999999999997,3109.12," it's not anywhere. Yeah, improv anywhere. They do all these bizarre pranks where, you know, they"
3109.12,3114.64," they take turns getting on a new, except way stops, pants lists. Right. Until the cars filled with"
3114.72,3119.3599999999997, pants list people and then have someone drive a hot dog cart through selling pants and it's something
3119.3599999999997,3123.7599999999998," that you know, the people and talk about it all month and then their life, it's not like,"
3123.7599999999998,3128.8799999999997," do I make it their life more interesting by doing a retard voice? But it's like, I can imagine"
3128.8799999999997,3133.2," they're timing that game. I mean, ideally it's, it's a little more interesting and I don't think"
3133.2,3138.8799999999997," it's anywhere near unless you're just like, I, you know, prone to to be, I rate it the smallest,"
3138.8799999999997,3142.72," you know, provocation. I don't think it's anywhere near the people that are screaming, you know,"
3142.7999999999997,3146.0, and words and all these other things on there. Yeah. I didn't want to go ahead.
3146.0,3150.0," Yeah. But I was just going to take it back to the point, the difference between, I mean, again,"
3150.0,3155.52," this is just, you know, anecdotal. I'm saying in my experience, there seems to be discrepancy. So people,"
3155.52,3159.04," it would be interesting to see on a message boards, people that listen to podcasts and write responses,"
3159.04,3165.8399999999997," see if you notice any difference. And one of the few, you know, explanations that comes to mind for me"
3165.8399999999997,3172.0," is that because of the dedicated nature of PC servers, there's almost always an admin"
3172.08,3176.56," or moderator, someone with a building to like kick people. So what happens is if you go into,"
3176.56,3181.28," you know, say a team fortress server and you start spouting off that kind of sendyary language,"
3181.28,3185.28, then someone just kicks you immediately. Yeah. And then that's at the end of it. You don't
3185.28,3190.24," just kind of go on. It like the kids in the back of the, the field behind the Kmart getting away"
3190.24,3194.56," with whatever, you know, there's an old 30-point-of-mag back there and blowing off fireworks and stuff."
3194.56,3199.04," It's not the same. I was like, right, like I know. Yeah, we did that. I did that back there."
3200.0,3204.96," That was where I saw my first penthouse. I mean, I guess in general, I think gamers could do a"
3204.96,3210.64," better job of vetting the community. You know, I think we could use a little bit of like,"
3210.64,3215.68," we're cooler than you. You know, gamers should be, you know, we're cool. We're above"
3215.68,3222.64," getting on, getting on, getting online and you know, randomly, you know, assaulting people with"
3222.64,3228.8," middle school insults and of course they're not. I mean, yeah, well, you know, but I want to be"
3228.8,3233.76," in the club that is too cool for that, you know, right. But there's, I mean, right, the game"
3233.76,3239.04," community is a subset of humanity at large. So if you've got your assholes, you've got your nice people,"
3239.04,3242.88," you know, and also think it's the type of game you're playing. I mean, I imagine when you, like"
3242.88,3246.4," Jeff and he play, wow, it's a very different experience than when you're playing a team for"
3246.4,3250.6400000000003," your sort of, you know, it is. I mean, in a game that that is not competitive, but is actually"
3250.6400000000003,3256.32," cooperative. In general, you will find, you know, an MMO's in general tend to attract a, you know,"
3256.4,3263.92," this is not the 13 to 25 year old male, you know, it's a probably a greater cross section of humanity."
3263.92,3269.1200000000003," So chances are, you know, you're just not going to get that kind of locker room mentality, like"
3269.1200000000003,3275.04," we'll more often in a shooter. Yeah. But what's interesting to me is this, you know, this, it"
3275.04,3280.7200000000003," got brought up for a second. The beginning here is like, is the Xbox Live community or any console"
3280.7999999999997,3287.9199999999996," Live community less mature than the PC online community. I mean, I sort of am not sure if that's"
3287.9199999999996,3291.7599999999998," I mean, I haven't played enough PC online games to even compare the two. I mean, Sean, you've played"
3291.7599999999998,3294.7999999999997," a lot of you. I mean, you're up. I mean, you guys. Sean, you're point about the dedicated service. I"
3294.7999999999997,3298.9599999999996," think it's probably true, right? I think that's probably a major factor in it. I mean, I mean,"
3298.9599999999996,3302.3999999999996," I mean, certainly we've all been in PC games online, we're getting it's all fun."
3302.3999999999996,3308.16," Bag, you know, yeah, it's all money. I mean, that's, that's the difference. Like if if the PC"
3308.16,3313.52," gaming audience is more mature, it's because the cost of entry is more expensive, you know,"
3313.52,3320.24," you can write a kid can afford an Xbox and a parent is more like a buy an Xbox than a $2,000"
3320.24,3324.96," computer. Yeah, that's true. Actually, yeah, I mean, my experiences in Xbox Live, most of my online"
3326.08,3334.24," online shooter gaming in the console comes from Call Duty 4. So I'm new to it. And I have noticed,"
3334.3199999999997,3340.3999999999996," you know, on average, you know, my, my per capita gaming, you know, versus like Lousy,"
3341.52,3348.56," Lousy experiences with with other players, you know, is very, very high on in Call Duty 4. I mean,"
3348.56,3354.08," meaning almost every game there's dudes calling each other names. Yeah, where has I never had that"
3354.08,3360.24," happen in the PC one at all period. And I've played to level 55. So they also seem younger, too,"
3360.3199999999997,3365.8399999999997," like you're saying. They seem. Yeah, yeah. Have you guys, have you guys, uh, did you read about"
3365.8399999999997,3370.16, them doing the new dashboard update that they're going to let you look at the friends of your friend?
3370.16,3375.9199999999996, Yeah. Yeah. I think I don't know. I could see a Xbox Live going in a more social networking
3375.9199999999996,3380.3199999999997, direction and try to let you find more people that you can get along with who aren't your real
3380.3199999999997,3385.2," world friends, where you know, you could at least like find the friends of people that you know to be"
3385.2799999999997,3390.3199999999997," acceptable players and try to stake out more, you know, a bigger friend's list that you don't"
3390.3199999999997,3395.8399999999997, have to go out into the sort of wilds of Xbox Live to is at their motivation for doing it.
3395.8399999999997,3399.9199999999996," I don't know. I think so, but also, I mean, how much can you really learn from a guy who makes a"
3399.9199999999996,3403.6," probably name that you don't even understand or can pronounce? And, you know, what games they've"
3403.6,3407.6," played with their achievements? Like, there's, I can understand, you know, you want to see, like,"
3407.6,3412.08," you know, all of the EGM guys, you know, all their friends and who they are, or they hang out"
3412.16,3415.36," maybe they're hanging out with developers or something like that. But, you know, do you even,"
3415.36,3419.12," do you even know unless they say, this is, you know, such and such from this pre-developer,"
3419.12,3423.52," there's no information about you. It's not like a friend store or a Facebook or something,"
3423.52,3427.92, it actually has some meat to all you're knowing is what games they played and how many points
3427.92,3431.2799999999997," they have. You're not really learning anything about them. So, you don't really, I mean,"
3431.2799999999997,3435.84," can you really get that much about their gaming habits or how, you know, are they households online"
3435.84,3439.44," or not? Right. If they got to take, it's got to be, this got to be another step to it. Like,"
3439.44,3445.28, it's got to have some type of like bigger profile. Yeah. It would be cool to see them join open
3445.28,3451.28," social, but somehow I don't think Microsoft's going to go for that, you know, to just add it to your"
3451.28,3455.44, own social network. But I guess they could continue to add more things where you could get to know
3455.44,3460.7200000000003," people. I think that, like, I think it's just, you know, the same friends. Why don't you use it?"
3460.7200000000003,3466.0," Yeah. Seeing friends of friends, I think is a step that I understand a more of a social network"
3466.08,3469.92," thing, but it does, I don't think it really tells you much. Like, if you want to, if they'll,"
3469.92,3473.12, when the point is to kind of like go out and meet more people that may be fun to play online
3473.12,3477.76," games with, you know, you still, you still have to still crap you. You have to know about your friends,"
3477.76,3483.44," that's, you have to know about how readily they accept requests and stuff to. So, if there's someone who"
3483.44,3487.92," just clicks, yes, on every single time they get an invite because they want to be Joe Popular,"
3487.92,3493.12," it's not going to be helpful to you in any way, shape, or form to, you know, look at their friends list."
3493.2,3497.44," Yeah, because I know in the beginning, I just accepted everybody. Yeah, right. Yeah, my list is full and"
3497.44,3502.48," multi-frient. I have no idea who they are. Right. So, you 70% I don't know who they're. Right. I only need to"
3502.48,3507.6," have people that I know. Why learn my lesson on Xbox Live and now, like, on Facebook and things,"
3507.6,3511.52," I only take people. I know. So, actually, if you're listening and you've tried to be my friend,"
3511.52,3514.64," it's not because I don't like you, it's just because, well, maybe I don't like you."
3515.2,3518.16, I just don't know why I'm just doing that's like my family in front of me.
3519.12,3523.7599999999998," Does the, do the Xbox Live games have the ability at all to kick a player?"
3524.48,3529.04," Can you do that? You can, you can, yeah, you can get feedback. You can get feedback and if you get enough,"
3529.04,3532.7999999999997," that doesn't do anything. I mean, yeah, I mean, they're about to have it. If you get enough,"
3532.7999999999997,3536.64," if you get enough, what then you can get more. No, if you get enough,"
3536.64,3540.96," no, but if you get enough negative feedback, they will ban you for Xbox Live. Really?"
3540.96,3544.56," Yeah, I mean, the whole thing is like, how much do you, how long does anyone you said?"
3544.56,3548.48," No, people who said that every time they're playing Halo, every time they play and they"
3548.48,3551.04," lose to another team, they give negative feedback to every person on this."
3551.92,3554.72," I mean, I've heard people say that's like, really? Oh, yeah, absolutely."
3554.72,3559.36," That's great. If someone's going to stay the things that they say on there, that it applies."
3559.36,3562.96," Oh, God forbid, they do that after they call you this, you know?"
3563.68,3566.0," Yeah, so I mean, I mean, there is that, I mean, the,"
3566.0,3569.36," wait, we say, is there a system in place? Yes, but is it effective?"
3569.36,3572.48," I don't, I don't think so. I don't, I don't, I don't really seem any evidence of it."
3572.48,3574.64, You're wording it's theirs. The Microsoft can't arbitrate.
3574.64,3578.32," I don't, I don't imagine they would. No, I mean, I think some magazines have done articles like,"
3578.32,3581.92," you know, trying to get kicked off Xbox Live and whether it was successful or not. So,"
3581.92,3586.88," and it comes as no surprise, really, that a bunch of guys who are basically in, like,"
3586.88,3590.2400000000002," complete arrested development, because this is what they're choosing to do at their free time,"
3591.12,3595.6," cannot be mature when playing with others online, but it sure would be nice if they tried."
3595.6,3599.6," Really, it was online, can you? But no, I mean, I just, it just really annoys me."
3599.6,3603.68," I'm going to go now. I just want to play a couple rounds of some, you know, team fortress or"
3603.68,3608.08," halo or Caldo dance, like I have 75% of time I never even put my face down."
3608.08,3612.88," I swear it seems like every match I played of Caldo D4, one guy would be threatening the other guy"
3612.88,3616.88," of finding him in real life and kicking his ass. Really? Yeah. And then the question is,"
3616.88,3620.64," what are we supposed to be the same? You're like, oh, yeah. Well, I know how I'll find you."
3620.64,3623.92," Oh, I can do it. You believe it. I said best thing. Oh, so you're a patriot."
3623.92,3630.0," But my, my, my, my first route, a briefing video that I posted was as soon as I got some guy mad,"
3631.12,3634.96," like, he threatened me with that. So then the response was like, well, funky,"
3634.96,3643.36," up in real life. And then like, and then, like, and then, I'm going to get you in real life."
3643.36,3648.08," Yeah. We should get, we should just go to the end of the video, like a one up feature video feature"
3648.08,3652.08, where we fly to people who've decided they hate each other and want to kill each other to
3652.08,3658.4," say for instance, go and have and have like talks and possibly a fight, but talks like peace"
3658.4,3664.7999999999997, talks. Yeah. So do you think you could play Call of Duty 4 with Rick without getting angry?
3667.68,3673.12, What makes you so angry? How is your situation at home? That would be good. That would be
3673.12,3678.48, pretty cool. Encounter said. And then it was just invited him to fight. And we get even better. This guy
3678.56,3682.32," said, you're mom so fucking fat man, you better fucking eat him."
3683.52,3685.92, Disponsored by GFW. Yeah.
3687.04,3692.56," Only the gravy thing before we should, is that I didn't want to say that because I talk about it,"
3692.56,3697.36," you might get the impression that that's all I do when I go on. But like, that's not the case at all."
3697.36,3701.92," I mean, that's like something that's sporadically punctuates like very serious play. We're like,"
3701.92,3707.12," I'm playing to win or like, I like to, you know, like team forgeset, like to play like a leader role,"
3707.2,3710.3199999999997," I mean, absolutely serious. That's what people need to come on to. Ref you."
3710.88,3717.7599999999998," And that's your story. And first of the time you're just like, sort of spouting obscure bizarre jokes to Rory on team speed."
3718.48,3724.0," Anyway, yeah, there's not a lot of griefing. And if people heard what you were talking about,"
3724.0,3728.08, they'd probably just think you're fucking crazy. You tell me if this is griefing. Maybe this is
3728.08,3732.96," the one of the origin stories of it. And right after high school, we're at this party,"
3733.12,3738.48," and it was to watch the toxic Avenger. And they, you know, what? And there was some alcohol,"
3738.48,3742.56," some people were, you know, they were drinking alcohol, some people were participating in the"
3742.56,3748.0," inhalation of marijuana, some of them from the marijuana plant. And so they start this movie."
3748.0,3751.52," And there's this one guy that can done that here. You know, we don't. I'm saying this was a horror,"
3751.52,3756.4," but it makes great. And this guy, you know, there's one of the people that was there. He was like,"
3756.4,3761.2," my friends, it was my friend's house and his sister was there too. And she had some her girlfriend's,"
3761.52,3766.08, they invited some guys over too. And I got the sense immediately that this guy was absolutely
3766.08,3771.52, credulous. Like I could basically write this guy's reality forum by just saying things. So I couldn't
3771.52,3777.6," help myself in the movie started. And I told him, you know, I just started casually saying, like,"
3777.6,3782.0," hey, you've seen this before, right? He's like, no, I haven't. And I was like, well, you know,"
3782.0,3787.9199999999996," this is the most controversial film ever recorded. The toxic Avenger, I was like, I have, you know,"
3788.0,3793.2000000000003," I have books on its creation. And on the controversy in some of the, you know, the lawsuits that"
3793.2000000000003,3800.2400000000002, went down afterward. And basically what this is is every act of violence you see in here is real
3800.2400000000002,3804.88," and so far as it's, it's really happening to someone. What they did was they took all these terminal"
3804.88,3808.2400000000002," people with terminal illnesses and stuff. And they told their families, you know, they told them,"
3808.2400000000002,3812.8," hey, we will give you this amount of money. We're going to let you do whatever you want, you know,"
3812.8,3816.96," we'll hook you up in this this way. And we'll just shoot you up full of, you know, morphine."
3817.04,3820.48, And then we're just going to do these scenes. So I'm funny when I'm saying it now.
3820.48,3826.48," So I'm just like, this is kind of scary. So that was not to freak that way. And that was a"
3826.48,3831.52," sky he was impaired by by the cannabis leave and alcohol as well. Yeah. And I, right, we've,"
3831.52,3838.4," he might have been impaired naturally without, not, not in a clinical sense, but just you just"
3838.4,3843.52," mean, because like, in the first one person or another. Yeah. Okay. And so I'm telling them this and then"
3843.6,3848.56, the movie's just starting and he's getting nervous. And so then the first act of violence in the
3848.56,3853.36, movie and the movie is ridiculous. This is why I think I was willing to do it. Maybe it was like
3853.36,3857.52," saw or something which I've never seen. But anything that's like, even slightly credible."
3857.52,3861.12," This is the kind of movie where someone gets to arm ripped off and they just put some ragu,"
3861.12,3866.64, use some spaghetti hanging on the side. It's so clearly spaghetti. Right. Or they'll do like a quick cut
3866.64,3872.0, in the person's head that's exploding. Yeah. Like a balloon full of foam. Yeah. Exactly. And so the
3872.08,3876.0," first thing is that there's this kid and they're, they're on a bicycle and the, the punks"
3876.0,3881.6," are driving around the car and they're like, dude, run them over. That's 20 points. So everyone else"
3881.6,3886.24, was there. Most everyone else was there. It's seen the movie before and they're just ready to laugh
3886.24,3891.44, because it's so completely stupid. It has so many like idiotic lines in it and quoteable. And
3891.44,3896.48, so they hit the kid and it's like clearly it's like a dummy. It goes flying over the car and
3896.48,3901.28," everyone starts laughing and this guy look over at him. It's just kind of like, looking, you know,"
3902.0,3906.64," really seriously at it and then the guy in the car is like, he's still moving. That's not full"
3906.64,3912.0," points. That's not full points. So it's like, I'll show you full points and he's like backs up and"
3912.0,3916.56, they back up over the kid and that's when they put like a squash or something under a tire and
3916.56,3922.8," they run over and the kid at that point. Like he looked like he was getting ill and I was like,"
3922.8,3927.44," he thought he was watching a snuff film. I know and I had, then that applause man, just joking with"
3927.76,3931.92," you. Sorry. So I guess I answered my whole question. I was going to be like,"
3931.92,3937.28," you have to be briefed. But I guess it was, I hope you feel bad now."
3937.28,3943.68," Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. That. Do we need to do a break? Yeah, we'll do a quick break and we'll"
3943.68,3946.96, be right back with hopefully something a little more socially responsible.
3948.0,3954.16," This one up podcast is brought to you by the laptop experts, makers of the Toshiva satellite X205,"
3954.3999999999996,3961.3599999999997, a laptop with enough power to destroy a small planet. Visit www.toshiva.com slash expert.
3962.8799999999997,3968.0, We're back. Okay. So I last couple of weeks I've been talking about the Witcher.
3968.96,3974.24," I have been talking a little bit about the adult oriented things you could do in that game,"
3974.24,3981.12, probably more than the game itself. And I have been loving the game as a game and not just a way to
3982.0,3989.44, meet women. But I'm bringing it up here because I have now come to a complete full stop at this
3989.44,3995.04," game and I would just want to rant about it for a moment. I sort of hate to do it because, you know,"
3995.04,4001.3599999999997, it's not a quote unquote AAA game. It was nice. It's it's been getting lots of great reviews.
4001.3599999999997,4009.6, We gave it a very good review. But I just hit the end of Act 1 boss. And this is such a
4009.6,4015.92," fucked up piece of shit battle that I've done playing this game until I find out,"
4015.92,4021.12, either that there's a patch for this boss battle or one of the developers comes to my house
4021.12,4027.8399999999997," and beats it for me because you have a third option, hacks or hack. Yeah. And I wanted to bring it up"
4027.8399999999997,4032.24," here because I just wanted to ask you guys if you have ever hit that point in the game. Like,"
4032.24,4035.6," basically I spent the whole weekend I'm powering through the game and you know,"
4035.6,4038.88," you need to feel like you're making progress, right? Because we all got a lot of shit to do in"
4038.88,4044.0," our lives. We got a lot of other games to play and you need forward momentum, you know, or"
4044.0,4050.1600000000003," it's not worth it. And I spent the entire weekend on one what I'm sure when it boils down to it,"
4050.1600000000003,4054.8," if I ever do beat it, it's going to be a two minute encounter. But whatever it is I have to do,"
4054.8,4060.6400000000003," I have not done it. And I wasted hours, literally hours this weekend on this one thing. And it's"
4060.6400000000003,4066.08," compounded worse. And this is the reason another reason why we're rant, want to rant about it because"
4066.16,4071.84," it's one of those boss battles that comes immediately out of a cutscene. So, and it's a long cutscene,"
4071.84,4078.08," and you can't skip it. So if you die, you get taken to the end screen. You have to reload and this"
4078.08,4081.92, game already has long load. And every start when you come into the battle you're hating it and like
4081.92,4086.7999999999997," when the cutscene's playing, you're just like, right, and you can't click through and some"
4086.7999999999997,4091.92," sitting there going, okay, okay, yes, yes, I know I know. And then you're just starting talking to the"
4091.92,4097.2," boss out loud. Oh, I totally did. Yeah, which is not like, it's like, yes, yes, yes, fuck you, yes,"
4097.2,4102.32," fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. You know, my wife's like, are you playing this for fun? Yes,"
4103.2,4110.16," I am. Oh, I'm sorry, I yelled in the mic. This is a fun cat you tell. So, and then, you know,"
4110.16,4116.4800000000005," because it's an RPG where the battles can be, you know, there's a certain strategic element to it,"
4116.4800000000005,4121.2," you can, you can get yourself sort of powered up with potions and stuff. You can pause the game"
4121.28,4127.599999999999," during battle to switch your stance to do other things. But the fact, the problem is that because"
4127.599999999999,4132.639999999999," it comes right, literally out of a cutscene, the cutscene ends, the screen goes black for a second,"
4132.639999999999,4137.599999999999," and when it comes back up, the battle is in progress already. So you don't even, you don't even"
4137.599999999999,4141.679999999999," get like a minute to prep for change your items. Right. To change your items. Like, I could drink a"
4141.679999999999,4146.0," potion if I want to, but the dudes already wailing on me, can you quick save the game?"
4146.88,4151.2," So, positive you can, you can quick save at that point. I read on a forum that you can,"
4151.2,4157.6," God knows, I have not been able to do it. So, like, I'm dead as I'm trying to quick save. I'm already dead."
4159.36,4163.36," So I heard other people complain, you're not alone on that. The people I play,"
4163.36,4169.28," coming here with three other people and a couple of my twins that like, game in the same house,"
4169.28,4172.4," and for a while, one of them was playing Witcher. And while we were trying to play,"
4172.4,4176.16," I'm gonna hear as I heard him screaming about, I'm sure it's the same thing. You described it earlier,"
4176.16,4180.96," to me, the exact same terms. Yeah, I was on that. Yeah, I'm getting hex. Yeah, it's funny. I went to"
4180.96,4185.5199999999995," quarter to three, the forums there to see if anybody had a way around this thing. And so I went to the"
4185.5199999999995,4189.04," thread. It's been about the Witcher, and I stayed off of it because I knew there were spoilers."
4189.04,4192.639999999999," And I was looking through the thread to see if anyone had the same problem and sure enough,"
4192.639999999999,4196.879999999999," this is the boss battle where everybody's quitting. Yeah. And I feel, I do feel shit,"
4196.879999999999,4200.4, you're agonizing because there's been so many good things about this game. I've really been
4200.48,4206.5599999999995, enjoying it a lot. And just mind boggling to me that the developers would put something like
4206.5599999999995,4212.5599999999995, then and that nobody in QA that nobody called them on it. There could be something that just seems
4212.5599999999995,4216.4," broken to me. This is bad as anything, though. I mean, say if you have like, you know,"
4216.4,4220.5599999999995," kind of, come up some stupid S analogy, but you have like a really nice car. It's wonderful"
4220.5599999999995,4224.4," in every way, but you know that on the 35th mile, it's gonna break down every time. I mean,"
4224.4,4228.4, it means it's a shitty car. Right. I'm not gonna play that game. Everyone's gonna get to that same
4228.48,4231.5199999999995," point and they're not gonna enjoy it anymore. They're not gonna finish it. But, you know,"
4231.5199999999995,4236.32," there's people in the thread who said, well, that's a real damn shame because X2 through 4 are awesome."
4236.32,4240.48," Yeah. If you could just get past that part that you're hate. Just hack it then. That's a,"
4240.48,4243.679999999999," that's a luxury you have as a PC gamer. You don't need to buy a game, Jeannie."
4246.5599999999995,4251.5199999999995, I actually just got so mad that I threw the stuff. I did that with Metroid Prime. And this is one of
4251.5199999999995,4255.5199999999995," those things where anytime we're talking about difficulty, there's a billion people out there. The same"
4255.6,4261.200000000001," ah, God yeah. There's gonna be that Frankenbox live dudes that are like, you suck a view game."
4261.200000000001,4265.200000000001, You just suck. You're fucking strong. I was waiting for that when I posted on quarter to three.
4265.200000000001,4270.56," Right. When you learned how to game then. Yeah. And in Metroid Prime, it was like, I think it was"
4270.56,4276.8, start off. It was just a big rock monster. And I probably found like six times and it's a big monster
4276.8,4280.72, made a rock. And then you just have to do a ball. I got damn plant thing. Rolls down. You shoot the
4280.72,4285.12," weeks, but you shoot the weeks. And I think after six times, I was like, that's, you know what? That's too many."
4286.0,4289.360000000001, This isn't fun anymore. And then I took it and I went and I traded it back that same week to the
4289.360000000001,4293.52," story. You know, well, I was like, that's all it took though. You know, that forward momentum was lost."
4294.240000000001,4298.320000000001," And I didn't want to mess with it anymore. And the same thing happened with like, you know,"
4298.320000000001,4303.76, Final Fantasy 7's the one and only Final Fantasy of beaten Final Fantasy 8 9 and 10. I played them all
4303.76,4309.360000000001," for many hours at least 20 hours each. But on every instance, I came to a boss that became unbeatable."
4309.44,4315.04," I was just going to say, Japanese RPGs are notorious for like, you'll play your best 15,"
4315.04,4317.759999999999, 20 hours. And then you get to like that one boss that we haven't done.
4318.639999999999,4323.04, Everything perfect to that point. You're not going to be strong enough to kind of defeat that
4323.04,4327.12, boss no matter what type of strategy you use. And it's like game over and they've gotten
4327.12,4331.36," little bit better over the years. But like, Final Fantasy 12, I reviewed that for EGM. And I was really"
4331.36,4335.04," worried I was going to like the 20 hour mark. I was going to be like, oh, I can't go anymore."
4335.04,4339.04," And it wasn't that bad because you could, you could kind of go back and kind of power stuff up."
4339.04,4341.6," But I had to go back and like, right, just grind for a while."
4341.6,4345.36," What people are telling me to do in the Witcher and saying, oh, did you level up that this one"
4346.24,4350.32," ability that will knock him out? I mean, it's just no idea. That's just poor game exactly. That's what I'm"
4350.32,4354.8, saying. I should be able to beat because I'm pretty much as as high levels. I feel like it'd be at this
4354.8,4359.76," point in the game. I've done every side quest, you know, but the path I've chosen, which is more"
4359.76,4364.0," melee, apparently it's harder to beat than it is. Well, it's funny. Gen-Sau, she was on the"
4364.08,4368.88, mass-effect review with me and we had chosen different classes. And she'd done way more side
4368.88,4373.44," quests in me. And I had, I beat the boss. I think this is a fun and boss. I think it took me a second time."
4374.0,4379.44, Over 50 times she tried with her character class. I watched her play. She did nothing wrong.
4379.44,4383.2, And she still couldn't beat it because her character wasn't simply powerful enough. That's just
4383.2,4388.4," terrible game design. From if you ask me. I actually, I'm sitting here thinking as we're having this"
4388.48,4394.719999999999," conversation about what games that I've quit because of bosses. And I am such an obsessive,"
4394.719999999999,4401.679999999999, compulsive freak that I will play especially if a game has a hard boss and I'll play it like 10 times.
4401.679999999999,4405.839999999999," And it's almost like now that I've sunk that time in, there's no turning back. I have to keep going."
4405.839999999999,4411.28," And it's really bad because it's not fun. I mean, I mean, I mean, and I've played through a lot of"
4411.28,4416.879999999999," games that were just ridiculously hard that, you know, I just should have given up on, you know,"
4416.88,4423.84," like a beautiful Joe for it. Oh, that was a tough game. The final boss was tough in that."
4423.84,4428.96," The second last, I played the final boss in that game for four or five hours one day."
4428.96,4433.68," I can beat the first. You're talking about the one that the way you go up on the deals, your powers."
4433.68,4439.28," I mean, he has to say, it turns into this big fight on on earth. You become like giant,"
4439.28,4444.72," you know, walking, okay, robots or something. I don't even remember. You become big, you know."
4444.8,4451.360000000001," But yeah, I don't know. I'm always forcing myself to do that stuff. And when I want to quit,"
4451.360000000001,4456.08, I'll end up quitting a game more when I'm just sick of something that nags at me about.
4456.08,4463.12," I don't, I feel in my embarrassing was this, I solved the cameo for Xbox 360 launch game."
4463.12,4467.76," And there was one boss that I know, Joe, I was up to five in the morning. It was the water boss."
4467.76,4472.56," It took me at least three hours to be. And the mechanics were so broken,"
4472.64,4477.120000000001," controlling this park here to go underwater and, you know, not many developers know how to make"
4477.120000000001,4482.72," underwater. Like, it was so broken. And for three and a half hours, I have no idea the game was"
4482.72,4487.120000000001, even that good. And I kept playing just to kind of the sheet of the box. More patience than me.
4487.120000000001,4491.6," I wouldn't do it. Yeah, I mean, I could just play that for review of those. It was a review of that."
4491.6,4495.360000000001," It was even, which you even more embarrassing, because I wanted the achievement points."
4495.360000000001,4500.080000000001," I go ahead. The more interesting thing is like, what the hell are boss battles about?"
4500.08,4503.5199999999995," Like, why does this, what, you know, it's a tradition."
4503.5199999999995,4507.76," They were, they come from the arcade where they're an opportunity to make money."
4507.76,4511.92," They're put in the arcade. I mean, of course, it's interesting to see something big on the screen."
4511.92,4514.32, When you knew that that was a technical limitation at the time.
4514.32,4518.16," Yeah. But they were very much there, because that's when you eat the majority of your quarters."
4518.16,4520.96," I bet, like, if you looked at the graph, you produced a graph of how many"
4520.96,4524.88," quarters people are putting in in each level of game. The bosses, the one where you're like,"
4524.88,4529.28, even if I'm going to get two grenades off on this guy and take off like two health bars
4529.599999999999,4534.48," from it's worth another quarter. So what happens, I think, is you got that legacy thinking,"
4535.04,4539.2," and it appears in the strangest places like in Bioshawk, you know, where like, we have to do"
4539.92,4544.719999999999, something. It's a good way to change the pace of a game. It's constantly going one place and
4544.719999999999,4551.04, fighting a bunch of other guys to give it the sense of drama and climax. But I think they go wrong
4551.04,4556.24," in my case. And I don't mind, too, if it feels like it's a fair progression of what you've learned"
4556.8,4562.0, throughout the course of the game or even up to that section of the game. If this is like the
4562.0,4567.2," culmination of the skills you've accumulated, that's a marketing facility that matches you over"
4567.2,4571.36," the fucking head that you're not prepared for. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's like a different school of"
4571.36,4574.96," boss battle. There's the one where it's like Sean saying where it's a quarter reader,"
4574.96,4579.2," where it's just this ridiculously powerful thing that you got to, you know, punch a million times."
4579.2,4585.599999999999, Or there's the sort of Zelda or Metroid model where the boss battle is sort of the final
4585.68,4590.08," exam for that switch of the game. It's like now put all this into play, you know?"
4590.08,4596.08," Right. And that's where I feel like the the Witcher does is not doing that even if it thinks it is,"
4596.08,4600.72," you know, it's like, okay, I have now played this game for many hours. I've done all the"
4600.72,4605.52," leveling up. You told me, you showed me how to do this. You showed me how to do potions and I can do all this."
4605.52,4610.88, And now this thing is like one or two killing me coming out of a long cutscene. Fuck you.
4611.2,4616.56," Oh, that's another thing that whole cutscene thing like, I've sat through many games where it's like,"
4616.56,4620.4800000000005," you get this hard boss fight, but you're sitting there for 10 minutes, listen to a speech. Like,"
4620.4800000000005,4625.04," oh my god. Yeah, I probably wouldn't even be having this rant if there had been like 30"
4625.04,4630.24, freaking seconds of prep time between the cutscene and the fight. That to me was just like the
4630.24,4636.64," the insult to injury for the the less the the I like Robert's analogy that, you know, the"
4636.72,4641.04," bosses, the final exam for the I think a recent example of something that worked really well."
4641.04,4646.88," There's the final level and half life episode two. Yeah. And that was because, you know,"
4646.88,4650.320000000001, we're in a Fermi police. I haven't got to let him do that. You haven't got to this.
4650.320000000001,4655.68," I've got to kick you out of here, dude. Because there's a lot of stuff. We're like, we're"
4655.68,4659.12," going to get a top of a no-game. No-game. No-game. Hard discussion. Go ahead, go for it. Go for it."
4659.12,4664.0," Go for it. That wouldn't be specific. It's not a plot spot. Yeah, it's a combat. Yes, go."
4664.0,4669.44," I've heard the final fight is really good. So the, yeah, the abbreviated version is that"
4669.44,4675.36, the game's teaching you to use your gravity gun throughout the game. It's teaching you to use a vehicle
4676.72,4680.88, to combine all these different things and to get around. And basically it just puts it all together.
4680.88,4685.84, It's taught you had to fight a certain type of enemy and then it introduces one new wrinkle. And then
4685.84,4690.96," it says here, you can do all these things at once. It's just a great multitasking part where it's fun."
4691.04,4696.56," And there's no single way about it. I mean, some people decide that they're going to ram certain"
4696.56,4701.2, enemies with a vehicle. Others decide to figure out that and throw an energy block with it is
4701.2,4706.8," massively lethal. And there's just any number of ways about it. I thought that was like very,"
4706.8,4710.88," you know, fun and it made sense. Yeah, I loved that. And that was all the difference in the world"
4710.88,4717.2, to me because I did not be that final fight of Half-Life 2 episode 2 in the first try at all.
4717.2,4722.4, It took me a bunch of tries. But it never got me aggravated because I felt like they've given
4722.4,4727.84," me all the tools here. And I am feeling, I know that I am feeling to use them correctly. I know that"
4727.84,4733.2," if I just practice this, I'll get it. It felt totally, it was hard, but it felt totally fair."
4733.2,4738.5599999999995," And when I did it, it was completely satisfying. Whereas now I feel like if I beat this fucking"
4738.5599999999995,4743.92," thing, it's just going to be some random luck. Like, oh, God, thank God, he, you know, I was able to"
4743.92,4748.72," like run away at this minute. I threw a grenade through my legs and let it bounce. Yeah, yeah."
4749.76,4754.88," I thought that the bosses, and to go the other way for positive examples, like in resin, you will"
4754.88,4760.8," for work really well. They all have some gimmick to them, but none of them, they all seem to be difficult,"
4760.8,4765.2," but none of them were actually. I mean, Zelda bosses are notoriously fantastic. I mean, they're always great."
4765.2,4769.68," I mean, I thought I think, Mark Alexey so far. I mean, like, talking, telling a talk about"
4769.76,4774.72," teaching you everything you need to know to get to that final stage, you know, the same thing there."
4774.72,4778.08," I mean, I think Nintendo does a really good job with boss boss. So I have to say, you know, I'm a big"
4778.08,4782.4800000000005," Metroid fan, but I think the prime bosses after a while, especially toward the end just get,"
4782.4800000000005,4787.4400000000005," it's like, how many health bars can you really have and how long am I, my fingers bleeding yet?"
4787.4400000000005,4792.0," Because that's basically what it comes down to. Yeah. It was the game cube was that that,"
4792.88,4796.88," one into prime. One into prime. I guess it is the first one where there's this freaking, like,"
4797.68,4801.28," I think it's an early boss, but I can never beat it. So I quit the game. You're like, it's giant"
4801.28,4805.04," plant. It was like the first one. It was the first one. I couldn't beat it. Wait,"
4805.04,4809.68," he wait, he see them. It's a console game. So I don't get wait, he see the end ones."
4809.68,4815.84," They're all no, I won't see it. I don't give you two, but you can watch it."
4817.04,4822.16," I didn't have too much trouble with the Metroid Prime, but I sometimes have a lot of trouble with"
4822.16,4826.32, boss battles. And sometimes it's the opposite. You were just saying how much you like Resident Evil 4.
4826.32,4833.04, I remember buying the rocket launcher in Resident Evil 4 and saving it up for the moment.
4833.04,4836.48, Yeah. I bought this rocket launchman. I've waited until something big jumps.
4836.48,4841.679999999999, I did that. I did that for one month. I take the rocket launcher in that the big boss battle between
4841.679999999999,4846.0," disks were it's like you're in this big room and I forget the plant. Yeah, plant then you have"
4846.0,4851.12, and there's like one weak spot and I shoot a rocket at it and he dies and the first like 10 seconds
4851.12,4857.04, I did that in the same exact anti-clamactic thing I've ever seen. I got been saving this rocket launcher
4857.04,4861.04, and then it was just over. I didn't even know what the point of the buck. That kind of thing is point.
4861.04,4866.08," Because I mean, yeah, hey for it and if using this or maybe not one hit because yeah,"
4866.08,4871.44," what do they call the big things the gigantes? Yeah, they like those are really cool."
4871.44,4876.24, Kill those and it's a way there if you do get frustrated and you're like I'm sick of doing this
4876.24,4880.64, and shooting it and waiting for the like good to come out as head so I can shoot that or jump up and stab it.
4880.72,4884.400000000001," Yeah, I'm just going to hit the scout to rock it. I thought that's it. Yeah, but you know,"
4884.400000000001,4889.12," sometimes I think boss battles like have too much to bear. I mean, you're talking about how"
4889.12,4896.0, there's sort of the way that we have you know climax and conflict resolution and gain. Right.
4896.0,4901.12," And considering everyone plays these things differently, you don't really know if they're really"
4901.12,4905.280000000001," going to get the experience they're supposed to have. I mean, ideally you would get to your boss"
4905.36,4910.32," in the Witcher and have this like great battle that where you win by the skinnier,"
4910.639999999999,4915.84," teeth, right? And you know your your victorious and you feel great about it, but everyone, you know,"
4915.84,4920.8," it's going to have some weird experience with this. I mean, I mean, I'm not in the go-up attention,"
4920.8,4925.28, not difficulty. Right. And I think the reason to that I'm that I'm so hostile about it here is
4925.28,4930.16," because I'm I would up till that point, I was liking this game so much. I thought that they totally"
4930.24,4935.84," nailed the combat. So it was so disappointing to me. Yeah. Shoot, we're getting the a hand signal here."
4935.84,4940.88," And Sean, we keep not talking about what we promise you will get to talk about. You, you're the one"
4940.88,4944.88," who asked to leave, right? I could leave and let you guys continue. Yeah, I want to hear about it. I can go in"
4944.88,4948.639999999999, there. Yeah. Now you can't say every week. I keep every week I keep wanting to talk about
4948.639999999999,4953.599999999999," company here as a posing front. You've been a so-and-that game hard car online lately. I have,"
4953.599999999999,4959.36," I mean, selling it. I have just as a getting money for it. As a natural byproduct of being like genuinely"
4959.839999999999,4963.04," in love with it. You know, I mean, when you like something and you want other people,"
4963.04,4966.4, you're the same way you want your daughter to listen to the music you listen to.
4966.4,4969.92, Mm-hmm. So I've been trying to get everybody on E.G. in the Play Orange box. I've been
4969.92,4973.28," every day. I'm like, I've been this and everybody's doing it and everybody's loving it. So."
4973.28,4976.5599999999995," And I think it was sometimes that you know, back when I was in high school, I'd tell my friends,"
4976.5599999999995,4982.88," like, man, you've got to make out with my girlfriend. She is such an awesome kid."
4982.88,4987.92," So like, come on, you got to come back to my place and try the rest of your bed. Yeah. Yeah, it was awesome."
4988.0,4992.64, That went by. Did you that that went by a notice? Was it last week? Yeah. You were talking about
4992.64,4997.4400000000005," something about your band and Jeff said, all of your band has been in your wife. Yeah."
4997.4400000000005,5002.08," Rather than rather than whatever it was. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was like, where can we?"
5002.08,5007.04," I heard him right. I was just like, yeah. Right. Right. Right. That's how you swing."
5008.96,5014.64," But the, the, the hard thing about the difficult thing about talking about this game for me is that"
5015.04,5020.64, I don't have extensive experience with RTS is not not the same extent that I do with FPS is where I
5020.64,5027.4400000000005," played almost everyone made in the past, you know, however many years. So I could say what I like,"
5027.4400000000005,5030.96," I've always been able to say what I like about it, but not to be able to say that, well, this is"
5031.84,5036.320000000001, absolutely unique to this game. Right. So that's kind of made me hesitant to like really jump in
5037.12,5040.64," in the way that I might ordinarily do, you know, with the first first shooter discussion."
5041.6,5046.400000000001, I've read some of the stuff you that you've written online about that and like a lot of it is similar
5047.360000000001,5053.92," in fact to relics other franchise Don of War, which came first. So a lot of a lot of what"
5053.92,5058.240000000001," developed out of company here, I'll start it there. Came from Don of War. Yeah. Right. And Don of War, of"
5058.240000000001,5063.68," course, devolved from other games. And those good things are, I mean, you know, in a schematic"
5063.68,5069.76," wave approach, he has to say that instead of having the usual rock paper scissors, where you know,"
5069.84,5074.4800000000005," if someone has this type of unit, I have to use this type of unit. And the more of this type of"
5074.4800000000005,5078.64," unit, the better, or you know, the traditional movement through the phases of early, you know,"
5078.64,5082.72," initial combat, mid-level stuff, and then when you've maxed out your tree, then you just bring out"
5082.72,5087.68," your big guns. So in company here, a unit that you have at the very beginning of the game is"
5087.68,5091.92," useful, the entire time. And you gain better and see with them. So if you have a rifle squad that you"
5091.92,5097.84," start off with his brids, you can, they might survive the entire battle and they will continue to be"
5097.92,5102.72," useful to you the whole time. That's good because instead of just constantly worrying about, well,"
5102.72,5108.400000000001," I have to have it more of these, or, you know, I have to just do specifically this sort of thing to"
5108.400000000001,5114.96," counter this. You're able to experiment and all sorts of random stuff can happen. And of course,"
5114.96,5119.12," it looks great. So in an example of something that would happen that you might not have planned is,"
5119.68,5124.88," you know, we were playing this for versus four match. And we know that the opponent is able to call"
5124.96,5128.96," and reinforcements down this one road. We figured out the road that they were coming in on. So we said,"
5128.96,5134.24," let's go back there. Let's land a glider there, take some commandos and start to set up explosive charges"
5134.24,5139.04, along this highway. So that we can detonate them when they bring in some more panthers or something to
5139.04,5144.0, rout us. But so we got caught with our pants down when we're doing this and they send over just this
5144.0,5149.28," huge six squads of infantry, mixed infantry, you know, anti-tank guys, you know, light machine and"
5150.24,5154.5599999999995," squad. So we had already had the bombs placed. So we said, let's run back to the far corner of the map"
5154.5599999999995,5159.84, and pop smoke and the way that works is like it gives them a fog of war so they can't see you. They're
5159.84,5164.0, going to have to get right next to you to find you. So that mean meant that they had to walk right
5164.0,5168.5599999999995, down the path where all the explosives were just to get noticed and knows what the SCS. So when they
5168.5599999999995,5173.599999999999," did that, then we blew up the explosives and it blew up like the equivalent of like 60 guys."
5173.68,5178.88, And they'll go flying. But that was almost the majority of that players army at the time.
5179.4400000000005,5182.8," And so it was just devastating, you know, I mean he kept playing, but we were like, oh God,"
5182.8,5188.56, he would have wanted to just drop from the game at that point. So moments like that are awesome.
5188.56,5193.4400000000005," And it's part of the fun is, you know, you go, it's really a real-time tactics game. I mean,"
5193.4400000000005,5197.76, the way strategy and tactics are used interchangeably doesn't make sense here. But the strategy is
5197.76,5202.72," before you play and that's really fun. You say, this is what, this is what I know tends to happen in"
5202.8,5208.240000000001, this game every time I play it. Let's try to put together a broad plan. We were going to like
5208.240000000001,5212.72," focus all of our resources on taking this one area of the map. And again, instead of just a not"
5212.72,5216.72," play victory point. So instead of just getting to the other person's base and wiping it out,"
5216.72,5220.88," you want to capture and hold territory. And that's another thing that makes the game unique from say,"
5222.16,5226.08," you know, command and conquer or something like that. Right. The quantum war game sort of the ones"
5226.16,5230.88," that first started using that, you know, they had the idea of the control points,"
5232.16,5236.88," you know, capturing parts of the map, which really sort of discourages, obviously discourages,"
5236.88,5240.72, startling. Right. You can't sit in your base and hold up stuff. You'll just need to fight at the end
5240.72,5244.5599999999995," when you got your good units. It means that you have to get what you have out there,"
5244.5599999999995,5250.0, immediately and use them to the best of your ability. So you're constantly doing that. And it's
5250.0,5254.24, fun and then you get it. And the game's like flip flop a lot more. Instead of just push you one side
5254.32,5259.44," gradually pushing into the other space, you gain and lose control of these points. And then,"
5259.44,5263.679999999999," you know, you get down to the the timers are taking because you have tickets like in battlefield."
5263.679999999999,5267.76," And you take, okay, crap. There's three victory points on this map. And you have to hold the majority"
5267.76,5272.4," of them to keep the ticker from going down on your side. And we've got one, but they have the other two."
5272.4,5277.44," And we've been so far just budding our heads, you know, hopelessly trying to take this one spot."
5277.44,5280.639999999999," Let's all of a sudden change your plan and go for the other one. And then you do something like,"
5280.64,5285.200000000001," you parachute a bunch of guys in land and gliders. Or if you're, you know, pants or let you throw"
5285.200000000001,5290.64, in a quick and mobile force and overwhelm that way. So that stuff's all fun. But it's kind of just
5290.64,5294.0," that, you know, we talk a lot about, you know, you go to bed and you think about a game. It's the ideal"
5294.0,5298.0," game for that because you strategize at that point. And then you say, okay, let's play the game."
5298.0,5301.52, And then you try to implement that. But then you've got to make it work with the tactics
5301.52,5305.68," that are responding to the specifics of the other person's play. You know,"
5306.08,5310.4800000000005," you know, it would be an interesting game for you to try if you haven't."
5311.04,5318.16," Would be starcraft because, you know, this is a game that's that's online popularity and that"
5318.16,5322.320000000001," in fact, it is professional ease of it now is for a reason, right? Because you have three"
5322.320000000001,5326.96, different sides that are totally different from each other that have totally different strategies.
5326.96,5333.360000000001," And, you know, every game plays out in a completely different way. I mean, I think going back,"
5333.44,5337.679999999999, maybe I could see it in the work like chess where it's just timeless. But I would wonder
5337.679999999999,5341.92," about little stuff that the people I play with are connoisseurs of the genre. Yeah, it insists to"
5341.92,5346.4," me that like, no, you're not going to like anything else because what I like is the specificity of"
5346.4,5352.16," actions in company here is where if there's a building, you can get your guys in the building. And then"
5352.16,5357.44," you gain, you know, additional defensive properties or whatever. You can set up a machine gun in a"
5357.44,5360.799999999999," window and you're field of fires exactly as it would think. If you kill someone, you could pick up"
5360.8,5365.52, their weapon. So then immediately you're Lieutenant who is walking around basically committing orders.
5365.52,5369.2, Now as a Panzer Schreck. And so now you can group with someone else and he's useful and I take it.
5369.2,5375.2," Right. I mean, all that you can compare the two generations that you're in cover too. So like if there's"
5375.2,5380.0," like a wall, and if you move your guys to that, then they'll fight more effectively from there."
5380.0,5384.64," I mean, it would be more like a chess thing or a go thing. It would be going back in time to see"
5384.64,5389.2," a rudimentary form of this genre. But those are fine though. Because I mean, I don't think you add"
5389.2,5393.84," stuff to chess doesn't make it any better. I mean, I'm just kind of questioning is it that state?"
5393.84,5397.76, Is it more like a chess or is it more like the difference between like battlefield 42 and
5397.76,5402.88, battlefield 2? Where you're going to miss the fact that you can't join squads and they can't spawn.
5402.88,5408.88," Well, to me personally, my opinion is that it would be more like chess. I mean, your, you know,"
5408.88,5413.28," you may feel completely different about it. I mean, for sure, there's a million things you can do in"
5413.36,5420.88," company fairs that you can't do in Starcraft. But to me, the core of it is so awesome, like chess,"
5420.88,5425.04," that, you know, maybe there's enough to hold on to. It would be interesting if you had it. In fact,"
5425.04,5429.44," closest to some compared to like a command of conquer 3, which I thought was like dreadfully"
5429.44,5435.04," boring compared to company here. To me, and I've played like very, very few strategy games,"
5435.04,5441.12," and most of them were console centric, which probably means that they were just totally lame."
5441.2,5446.64," But, you know, Starcraft seems a little more appealing to me because I can at least digest"
5446.64,5450.8," what's going on. Whereas something like company of heroes whenever you're talking about it. I'm like,"
5451.5199999999995,5456.8," no, I just don't understand how this game comes together, you know? It sounds like everything in the"
5456.8,5464.24," world of war is available to you, and I don't understand like how you, you know, get into a game"
5464.24,5470.0, with unlimited possibilities. The best thing to do with games I live with too are play the single player
5470.08,5474.64," campaigns. You know, if you jump into a multiplayer game with a guy like Sean, you're going to"
5474.64,5480.08," get your ass handed to you. But, you know, the single player games do do a good job of, you know,"
5480.08,5485.12," only, you know, like any good game, you just start off with a few things, and it ramps you up. Okay,"
5485.12,5489.2, here's how now in this next mission we're going to add air units. Is that how you learn how to play the
5489.2,5495.36," game? Or it is. Let me say something like, like, the trick I agree is to convince someone that"
5495.44,5501.839999999999," it's a game that's within their realm of playability. You write certain things off for various reasons,"
5501.839999999999,5506.08, and this is like kind of a parallel experience for me is to what happened with the flights combat
5506.08,5510.48," flight simulator I'll too, where who's plays a flight simulator, right? You need to control. You"
5510.48,5515.2," get a million buttons. What's engine pitch? I mean, what's prop pitch, right? What's what? Why don't"
5515.2,5521.12," want to mess with like, the fuel mixture in a plane? And then you start doing it. And then as you"
5521.2,5524.96," play it and you gradually ease yourself into these things, you're like, oh, I don't have to play with all"
5524.96,5530.24," those things on. I can turn them on one by one as I understand them, or I should just play and see what"
5530.24,5534.5599999999995," happens rather than just being, you know, like you hear about a book so much, and you're like,"
5534.5599999999995,5538.08," there's no way I'm going to read this book. I'm not going to get it. And then you read it and you're like,"
5538.96,5544.96," oh, like I totally get it. You know, I just needed to actually try and do something with it. But so"
5545.92,5550.32, there is that intimidation factor. And I think it would be greatly beneficial for makers of these kind of
5550.32,5554.96," games to do everything in their power to address it. Because I see it over and over again. You know,"
5554.96,5558.0, a lot of people are here. We're talking about it and are buying it. You want to play and they don't know
5558.0,5563.28," how to learn. So like Jeff says, if you also make it sound like the high level stuff is what's enjoyable"
5563.28,5569.28," about it. It is. I mean, it is. And I think you get to that. I think you should be able to get to that."
5569.28,5574.0, But it is absolutely the more experienced you are the more enjoyable the game is because you're able to
5574.0,5579.28," make the game sort of dance to your tune. But right, that's the case with everything, right? I mean,"
5579.36,5583.12, if you get to a point where you're playing a different game than the beginners are playing.
5583.12,5588.5599999999995," Yeah. If you play the campaign stuff, you have to understand that it's going to be entirely different from,"
5588.5599999999995,5593.92," I mean, tactics that you're using against the computer are going to be absolutely useless in an online"
5593.92,5599.2," match. But the reason to play it is because you at least get a familiarity for how you create these units,"
5599.2,5603.599999999999, how you produce them when you can. And you still get a sense for what works. So even if you're playing
5603.599999999999,5608.16," it gets the computer and say your British and you're building these emplacements, these mortar"
5608.24,5612.639999999999," emplacements, and you also build machine guns next to them. So the machine gun stops guys from coming"
5612.639999999999,5618.16, and throwing grenades into the mortar pit. And the mortar pit stops enemy vehicles that have their own
5618.16,5623.04, long arm things from just coming up and blowing up the machine or a lot are blowing up the machine
5623.04,5628.72, gun from afar. You know. So you can figure that out a little bit in single player. And then you just
5628.72,5633.04, kind of continue to build on that. You start to see how things are useful in different ways and useful
5633.2,5638.56, in importantly in combination. Because it's never like there's never one solution. So that's again
5638.56,5643.6," where the rock paper scissors now works because you know, like I said, the machine gun stops the"
5643.6,5647.36," infantry that's able to stop the mortar. But because you're able to combine them all, it's more of"
5647.36,5652.32, a game where you're able to technically if you want have rock paper ancestors as the hand you play
5652.32,5656.32," all at once. But then they're even more would be, you know, if you somehow were I'm not high enough"
5656.32,5662.16," to understand what that means. It's like rock paper ancestors all at once. Well, say in rock paper"
5662.24,5666.96, scissors you have one choice. You play your hand that you play as either rock paper or scissors.
5666.96,5671.04, And no matter what it has a strength against another the other person's hand and it's also
5671.04,5675.92," has a corresponding weakness. But now I'm saying say for example, again with the machine gun mortars,"
5676.48,5680.08," if one of those is rocking the other's paper, then you can get scissors in the form of maybe a"
5680.08,5686.16," sniper, right? So then you use all those together, the sniper to spot far off stuff. And then with"
5686.16,5690.639999999999," all three of those, you're technically at that point, then it's not just a matter of they had the"
5691.200000000001,5696.08," they had the luck of the draw or anticipation and said, hey, they're probably going to build a machine"
5696.08,5699.52," and crew. I'm going to build mortars and blow up the machine gun. This way you say, well, I'm going"
5699.52,5703.6," to send a sniper over and snipe their more. I mean, you depending on how you've field those things"
5703.6,5708.240000000001," that you have, you have every option available to you. And then as you play, then you see,"
5708.8,5712.320000000001," you know, that there are greater options. And they're funded using in conjunction and they will be"
5712.320000000001,5718.320000000001," things like, you you get ultra decryption as the British, and that's basically, you know, you'll"
5718.48,5722.32, get these notices on your screen every time your enemy is building or feeling a new vehicle or
5722.32,5728.799999999999," a squatter tank. You know, and so if you get this notice that, hey, they just brought in a king tiger"
5728.799999999999,5733.5199999999995," or a homo, which would be an artillery piece that can almost launch across the entire map,"
5733.5199999999995,5739.2," provided they have some sort of observer there. You can say, even though it's in the fog of where"
5739.2,5743.599999999999," I'm going to land a glider with a light tank in it right there, because I know that's where I know"
5743.599999999999,5747.599999999999, they just brought this thing in. The tank's going to come out and that light tank is going to be
5747.68,5751.92, great against their mobile artillery. And I'm going to blow it up then. They're going to immediately
5751.92,5756.160000000001," take out this tank, because it's going to be one shitty little tank in their back base, but I'm going"
5756.160000000001,5761.92," to get their mobile already, which cost 800 manpower, and my tank only cost me 300. It sounds really"
5761.92,5766.4800000000005," complicated, but it's I think just experiencing it. And that's the fun of it, though. So let's let's"
5766.4800000000005,5770.08," let's let me not just apologize for the complexity, but kind of like celebrated, right? And then we're"
5770.08,5777.120000000001," so used to games that are falling into one of these categories and, you know, areas of familiarity."
5777.2,5782.0," And it's really eye-opening to play something that's outside of that comfort range. And to like I said,"
5782.0,5785.04," you know, when you read a book outside of what you assumed was your comfort range, and then you find"
5785.04,5789.28," yourself really liking it, and you end up liking a lot more than books in your comfort range. And that"
5789.28,5794.5599999999995," becomes your new thing that you want to, you know, become an expert in. And I think it's kind of like"
5794.5599999999995,5797.92," that, it may, it might not work for everyone, it happened to me with a slight symptoms. It's definitely"
5797.92,5803.84," happening again now with our TS because of this. So that's probably more, you know, that"
5804.56,5810.400000000001," just talking about these types of games with people like me, you don't play them. It's hard to"
5810.400000000001,5816.16," convey what the experiences. Yeah, because you don't have any like concise, you know, reference to"
5816.16,5821.12," when I say a humble, like what's that? It was like, if me and you were talking and you were just"
5821.12,5825.360000000001," hearing us talk about team fortious and you're like a level three century. She's like, it's also"
5825.360000000001,5829.52," also all this military culture stuff. I mean, I think maybe I'm waiting for, you know, a strategy"
5829.52,5835.84," game to be about like West Side Story, you know, it's where you have like different dance moves that"
5835.84,5840.64," do like different, you know, damages. Well, you're probably going to get a link from some"
5840.64,5844.64," reader now. That would be pretty amazing. Someone out there, please make a West Side Story"
5844.64,5849.200000000001," stretch. Definitely, you know, like if you're more say a fantasy guy, like, you know,"
5849.200000000001,5853.6," relics Don and War series, like we're saying, is that's like the fantasy strategy, that's"
5853.6,5858.0," the, you know, that's the Warhammer version of this kind of gameplay that's talking about."
5858.08,5863.2," So certainly like like Ryan likes that more. Like he asked them, I like them play and for me,"
5863.2,5868.16," I like I like to know, like so I see like an Ostwind or a Warborne, and actually know what that is,"
5868.16,5872.88, and there's at least some correlation to my familiarity with reading history and stuff that
5872.88,5877.36," right, these guys should be shit in their pants right now. And, you know, right, we, you and I have the"
5877.36,5882.24," stock all the time, or you'll say, oh, it's a bleb-lemission in August. The one with the plain and the"
5882.32,5892.24," thing in the door, and you go, yeah, that's what I just said. Yeah, you know, one of the great training"
5892.24,5898.96," RTSs for me was Age of Empires from Ensemble, any of the Age of Empires, and one great thing"
5898.96,5904.5599999999995," they do, and you'll just have to remind me of, of company heroes, does is, is that they have"
5904.5599999999995,5909.5199999999995," skirmish games against the AI. So they're not, it's not part of the campaign where there's a goal."
5910.240000000001,5915.52," Basically, it's basically a multiplayer game against AI opponents. And what I used to do in"
5915.52,5921.200000000001," Age of Empires, that is a good way to learn. Right, because then you see, because AI is, in the"
5921.200000000001,5925.4400000000005," Ensemble games, at least it's pretty damn good. So what I would do is I would, I would just play a"
5925.4400000000005,5931.120000000001," skirmish game against like two or three AI opponents, and I'd stop it after just like five or"
5931.120000000001,5936.96," ten minutes, and I would just see, I would stop and then look at the stats there, and just see what the"
5936.96,5943.04," computer had done versus what I had done, and I learned so much because invariably, the computer"
5943.04,5948.88," would have like five times as many resources as me, or something else, and I would at first I was like,"
5948.88,5955.12," this is fucking cheating. But then I realized, no, actually it's not. It's a smart. That's not how I learned"
5955.12,5959.44," and watch the replays. Right. I mean, it's so few people do it. It never occurs to them. They just keep"
5959.44,5963.44," asking, should I go play campaign again? Right. For one of these replays against, you could play them"
5963.5199999999995,5969.12," in the game. But when someone kicked your ass, you have that ability. Every RTS and existence"
5969.12,5973.759999999999," to watch the game from their point of view after it's done, and it faster speeds, so it doesn't"
5973.759999999999,5980.16," take for it. You could say, oh, they built these units rather than these, these seem to be effective"
5980.16,5984.16," in these circumstances. They went for these points rather than the other ones. You know, and you're"
5984.16,5988.16," able to look, I mean, just look at, oh, that's how I got Manus kicked. Right. And if, or if you have a"
5988.16,5994.0," good friend who can actually do it with you, you know, my, my, my Jedi trainer was Elliot Chin who used"
5994.0,5999.44," to be at computer gaming world, and then he was a Blizzard and now he's at Sega. And he taught me"
5999.44,6004.0," how to play RTS because he and I used to play Warcraft together, Warcraft, too. Yeah, I think I say,"
6004.0,6009.04," how does that work? He was at, uh, completely kicked my ass every time. It was very, it was very tough"
6009.04,6014.88," love thing, but he would kick my ass in a mean way, too. Like, like, the thing I always remember him"
6014.96,6022.0," doing is he, he came over and he would build guard towers at my, uh, my resource nodes. So basically,"
6022.0,6025.84," I couldn't mine anything and get the game would be over in like 10 minutes, because I haven't"
6025.84,6030.0," been not teaching you any. He's just like, he's grateful. Well, of course he was, but, but I"
6030.0,6034.16," know, they going, you fucker like games over, but that was like a lesson. He's like, you got to protect"
6034.16,6039.92," your resources. Yeah, flex. So that's from that. So, exactly. What's on this? Wax off."
6039.92,6045.84," But what strikes me with this whole conversation is that video games are so diverse and bizarre. Like,"
6045.84,6049.84, what does what we're talking about have to do with people who like to get on a little plastic
6049.84,6055.84," mat and move their feet to like J. Pop songs? Yeah. What is, how are these things related?"
6055.84,6059.92," Or even like have to do it. You don't even have to go that far. I mean, even what I'm doing with"
6059.92,6066.4800000000005," like, uh, you know, racing game or something. Yeah. Or the difference between that and half life,"
6066.5599999999995,6071.12," you know, yeah. I went back and forth last night between Mass Effect and Guitar Hero 3."
6072.16,6076.32," Speaking of boss battles. I'd like some of that chocolate in that peanut butter, whoever can"
6076.32,6082.719999999999, come up with a sci-fi adventure game using the guitar controller will have my money. That's what
6082.719999999999,6086.959999999999," I have to do though, because they'll run out of, well, maybe not because they can always add new songs,"
6086.959999999999,6090.4," but they'll put like an RPG mode. You know, like, when a fighting game's on like part five,"
6090.4,6093.36," well, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, do you know, legend, the double"
6093.44,6097.679999999999," fine game. It's like, you know, it's got the whole music thing, but it's like, uh, just a user guitar."
6098.88,6103.44," I probably probably probably put in the motor than that would be. Yeah, you hit it on your back"
6103.44,6108.88, and you swing it around like when it's time to get in the fight. Rock him to death. Yeah.
6108.88,6114.24," Yeah. I mean, yeah, those are converging already. So on for, we're ready to roll, but uh,"
6114.24,6119.36," last thing, because I couldn't get enough fellow GFWs to play. See, I wait with me."
6120.0,6126.0," Me, Roy in the gang are playing the, the, the, relic guys really next week. Nice. They're probably going to kick"
6126.0,6129.36," our ass, but it'll be fun. We got to have posted match. We'll have to offer."
6129.36,6134.719999999999," After Prax for our feature, watch the replay and say, uh, uh, or there's the chance, maybe we'll win,"
6134.719999999999,6138.48," because we're not playing their balanced team, which would be just insane. That would be like one of us."
6138.48,6144.0," Yeah. Like, oh, yeah, I'll fight a butterbeen or, uh, you know, because those are the guys that like"
6144.08,6150.16," know every exploit and play nonstop. But so, uh, the design guys, you see, still alive. It's awesome."
6150.16,6154.16," Butterbeen. I have no idea. Oh, I don't even know if I can't mind because I just thought of"
6154.16,6158.64," someone getting their ass kicked in, I visualized Johnny Knox Knox Knox, uh, Knoxville, getting a"
6158.64,6168.16, punch-up side hit in the sporty good story. The first movie? Yeah. All right. All right. I think we're
6168.8,6175.5199999999995," the rambles over. We don't but we just got in the brodeo. Uh, maybe we'll have more GFW people around"
6175.5199999999995,6179.92, next time. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll stick with you guys. I'd like that at a great time.
6179.92,6183.76, Thanks for having me. Yeah. Thanks for your always want to act. It's sucked. Right. Bobby.
