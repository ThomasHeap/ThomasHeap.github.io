0.0,4.0, This one up podcast is brought to you by Windows Media Center.
4.0,11.0," Your Xbox 360, your music, your photos, your TV shows and your videos with one connection."
20.0,23.0," Alright, we're back for the last time from Santa Monica."
23.0,25.0," You're gonna miss the place fellas, what do you think?"
25.0,27.0," No, I'm not gonna miss the place."
28.0,29.0," Very quiet now, John."
29.0,30.0, I'm still hung over.
30.0,33.0," Alright, you don't have to tell me about that one."
33.0,39.0, Thanks to our good friends that it would be soft and also our friends on the other side of the Atlantic.
39.0,41.0, Were they make the Macallon for us?
41.0,42.0," Oh, yes."
42.0,45.0, That stuff you were drinking smell like an Irish peep-bog.
45.0,46.0, What the hell was it?
46.0,49.0, It was 25-year-old Macallon.
49.0,51.0, I could smell it in some like five feet away.
51.0,53.0, It was fantastic.
53.0,54.0, It was so good.
55.0,57.0, And I could smell you from about 10 feet away.
57.0,60.0," Well, you know, it's a little hard to get up and start early to spend the season."
60.0,66.0, So this is the wrap-up show for E32007 from Santa Monica for the one up radio network.
66.0,68.0, That's John Davis and I'm garnetly.
68.0,72.0," Sean Elliott is here with us because we're gonna do PC, have a E in the here in this first segment."
72.0,77.0," And as promised, the man, the myth, the legend, the very good friend of the show."
77.0,79.0," Also, you like that title, right?"
79.0,82.0," I'm laughing and smiling over here, Garna."
82.0,86.0," That's then guy here to join us as he did last year and as joined us before,"
86.0,89.0, sorry for the little echo chamber response there.
89.0,92.0," We gotta, you know, I can't get to loud, I can't keep quiet."
92.0,94.0," I understand, thanks for having me on the show again."
94.0,95.0," Of course, do we love having you here?"
95.0,97.0," So, how are we start?"
97.0,99.0," We're gonna talk about PC, but I mean, and guy, how do you like,"
99.0,101.0, what do you think of the whole Santa Monica experience?
101.0,106.0," You know, honestly, I was expecting it to be a cluster-bleep before the show began,"
106.0,110.0, because that's what we were hearing from all the publicists and a lot of people.
110.0,113.0," I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
113.0,117.0, But I think the skill down experience has been so much better.
117.0,120.0," I mean, to be in these rooms where you can hear the game."
120.0,123.0," You can, you can, you can, but it's not cranked up all the way."
123.0,126.0," You can hear yourself think, you can hear what the developer's saying."
126.0,131.0," Very few developers and publicists, I think, lost their voice during the show."
131.0,132.0," So, I like the skill of it."
132.0,135.0," The only drawback was, well, there are two."
135.0,139.0," One was that, the running around that you might have to do depending on how you scheduled it,"
139.0,142.0, because the hotels aren't all clumped together.
142.0,143.0, And the other was Barker Hangar.
143.0,147.0," I mean, I really wanted to get down there and see some of the things around display,"
147.0,149.0, and I just wasn't able to.
149.0,150.0," Yeah, well, yeah, I never got there."
150.0,154.0," I wanted to, I was going to, I went to the hotel,"
154.0,156.0," I was a, and Sony, and all those guys worked,"
156.0,158.0," because I'd not been there, yeah, and it was like one or the other,"
158.0,160.0," so I did that one, because it was, you know,"
160.0,161.0, I think you made the right call.
161.0,166.0," Yeah, because they have more set up in their individual sweets, first of all."
166.0,169.0," And then the trip to and from Barker Hangar is time consuming,"
169.0,172.0," because it's not close, it's not close at all."
172.0,177.0," And really, when you drive up in the place, you absolutely get the shame that I went there yesterday,"
177.0,180.0," and it was like, oh dear, this is where, this is where E3 went to die."
180.0,184.0," I mean, it's really a just old-zroomist kicking around today,"
184.0,186.0," the next year, then moving it to Vegas."
186.0,190.0," I mean, that might just be Jeff Jeff Bell was quoted at MCV"
190.0,193.0," out of Europe saying that he thinks it should be Vegas,"
193.0,195.0," you know, Microsoft's an ASA member."
195.0,199.0," Well, what was interesting was, you know, the way the various"
199.0,201.0, console manufacturers sort of approached it.
201.0,205.0," I mean, Nintendo had a, you know, sort of,"
205.0,209.0," just a room set up where there were two house of it,"
209.0,212.0," and they had, you know, their guys, I guess, from the tree house."
212.0,217.0," And they were just basically cycle through, and you could sort of play whichever game you want to play."
217.0,220.0," Microsoft pretty much took over the vice-roy, you know,"
220.0,224.0," so they had a nice theater where they were showing Halo 3,"
224.0,228.0," and then in the various suites, you could go see individual games,"
228.0,231.0," like Halo Wars, or Fable 2 Mass Effect."
231.0,233.0," And then Sony, you know, like you're saying,"
233.0,236.0," they're the same hotel as EA and Activision, I think."
236.0,241.0," And on the main floor, they had their game display area where you could"
241.0,244.0, talk to the developers and get a little hands on.
244.0,247.0," Then going down a level, they had a breakout room,"
247.0,250.0," where you get individual presentations with developers,"
250.0,253.0," and then below that, which you point out, John, they had the arcade."
253.0,255.0," And when there was almost no one in there,"
255.0,257.0, that was a really big room with all these stations.
257.0,260.0," So like nearly every game, a little big planet wasn't there,"
260.0,263.0," which I was disappointed by, but you could play Heavenly Sword, you could play."
263.0,266.0," When I got there, I was the only person in this huge room,"
266.0,268.0," and it was like, you know, it was like, okay,"
268.0,270.0," to it. And then this other guy walked in,"
270.0,275.0, just after the caterer dropped off a bunch of drinks and stuff to put there.
275.0,278.0," And then there was just, and the caterer was just like in a black suit or something."
278.0,282.0," And this guy, with all these cameras and everything,"
282.0,286.0," built it out, things that the caterer is a Sony rep and starts asking"
286.0,287.0, a question.
287.0,290.0, Which the caterer proceeds to answer.
290.0,291.0, Really? It was hilarious.
291.0,292.0, That's awesome.
292.0,294.0," So this guy is like playing on chart at whatever he goes,"
294.0,295.0," hey, do you know when this is out?"
295.0,299.0," And the guy's like, yeah, I think that's September, October kind of time."
299.0,300.0, Nice.
300.0,302.0," Like, naughty dog needs the pressure."
302.0,306.0," We even better like, wait, you know the way the internet works is a September October"
306.0,308.0, and release announcement.
308.0,311.0," And spread across all the blogs and everyone's like, where the hell did this?"
311.0,313.0, Where the hell did this release date come from?
313.0,316.0," Oh, it came from the catering dude at this suite."
316.0,318.0, This is how our room res gets started.
318.0,321.0," Yeah, I agree with the, I agree with the Las Vegas thing."
321.0,325.0," I mean, I don't think it's much of a stretch to look around this sort of a convention"
325.0,328.0," if it's going to be like this and say, oh, this belongs in Vegas,"
328.0,330.0, because that's the place that's set up to do this sort of thing.
330.0,333.0," It would have been so much better because you would have had the,"
333.0,336.0," you could still have the sort of the, the bifurcated E3, right?"
336.0,339.0," You could have the Barker Hangar experience like, you know,"
339.0,343.0, I went to the NBA all starting in this year and they were at the Madalay Bay.
343.0,344.0, Right?
344.0,346.0, And so Madalay Bay has a pretty big convention center area.
346.0,347.0, And it's a bit of a hike.
347.0,351.0, It might even be longer than the old E3 hike between West Holland's Alpha.
351.0,354.0," But nevertheless, you could have in the same building, you know,"
354.0,357.0, the Barker Hangar type experience where you have the booths.
357.0,361.0," And then publishers could do, you know, they're behind closed door stuff."
361.0,362.0, And tell us what you have.
362.0,363.0, And tell us what you have.
363.0,366.0," The Madalay OEM GM, you could do the entire thing in just that, like exactly."
366.0,367.0, Exactly.
367.0,370.0," They're all set up like that. The Venetian as well because of the poems, the Sands."
370.0,372.0, The Sands Convention Center area there.
372.0,375.0," I mean, they're all set up to where everyone of those hotels is set up to run big conventions."
375.0,378.0, Las Vegas is equipped to handle big conventions.
378.0,381.0," I mean, that's, it's kind of a no brainer at this point if this is what they want to achieve."
381.0,382.0, Absolutely.
382.0,386.0, But one of the rumors I'm hearing is that they're going to combine E3 and E3
386.0,389.0," and E4 next year, which I guess makes it E7."
389.0,398.0, And have make it more like TGS or Lipes egg where there's a consumer show and press and retailer trade show.
398.0,399.0, It's going to take it in conference.
399.0,402.0, Back to what got them irritated about E3 in the first place.
402.0,408.0," Like was it being overloaded with people that didn't need to be there and it'd be coming up big, you know, dog and pony show?"
408.0,411.0," Like I said, it's going to be, it's a rumor."
411.0,414.0," You know, I mean, I, you know, I don't know how much stock to put in right now."
414.0,416.0," I think they're, they're going to explore things."
416.0,422.0," I mean, but my feeling is that I bet when each of us, you know, goes away and starts talking to our friends at the various publishers and people we know,"
422.0,428.0, we're going to hear that the response from publishers was not as negative as we thought it was going to be.
428.0,435.0, One of the things we've seen is the publishers are really enjoying it because they've feet on her and then all those in their voices and they're in air condition rooms and there's plenty of food.
435.0,439.0," And, you know, it's very comfortable for them to demo and they're in very location."
439.0,441.0," And all the journalists are like, I fucking hate it."
441.0,446.0," I've like walked from miles. I've not seen everything I wanted to. I mean, something you said, show almost like,"
446.0,451.0," slightly on the height of the elephant and you don't get to see the entire, you know, the readers and listen,"
451.0,454.0," listen, get to see everything and hardly anyone here."
454.0,455.0, Hmm.
455.0,457.0, That's why I want to see concern at this point.
457.0,461.0, I'm liking it. And even I have no issues with the Barker Hangar scenario either.
461.0,468.0," It's like, I would rather go into that environment and have absolutely unfettered access to any game I wanted,"
468.0,482.0, any given moment I want in an old airplane hanger that being the nicest convention facility in the country and have to fight through an army of like the grusiest fools in line to get every free sticker and pen and hat and everything.
482.0,486.0," You know, actually when you walk into Barker, they're trying desperately to hand caps, baseball caps to you."
486.0,488.0, And it was interesting to see all the people like nothing.
488.0,490.0, I know thanks and just I'm here to do business.
490.0,494.0," Whereas, of course, before it would be, yeah, sure, give me more hats."
494.0,497.0," You know, you don't open up a store down on the pier."
497.0,498.0, Thank you.
498.0,501.0, And I don't think the caps will be going for a whole lot on eBay anytime soon.
501.0,505.0," People spend all their money on the Microsoft Pat, but pads already."
505.0,507.0, All right.
507.0,510.0, So I think it's probably enough good wrap up on on E3.
510.0,518.0," But to me, I think the thing is, of course, you'd rather have the unfettered access to be able to go play the games, but having it spread out like it has been has been the biggest challenge."
518.0,522.0," And to your point about the publishers, one publisher, I've actually said, yeah, it's great."
522.0,523.0, We just get to hang out.
523.0,524.0, They bring catered food to us.
524.0,525.0, It's air condition.
525.0,526.0, A lot of people missed their appointments.
526.0,528.0, So we don't even have to do anything.
528.0,529.0," Well, wait."
529.0,532.0, It's a whole bunch of showoffery games.
532.0,535.0, And that doesn't really sound like it's effectively doing a lot for them.
535.0,544.0," And another point that came to mind to me talking to one of the guys at EA is that, you know, this is also going to be a challenge for them in the months to come."
544.0,551.0," Because as different outlets plan their coverage, there's always that, you know, those more scenes where we all gather around and tell you what we want to cover."
551.0,554.0," Well, where do we have, you know, opportunity to cover this game or that game?"
554.0,559.0," And typically coming out of E3 when everybody's seen stuff, they can all speak intelligently about it."
559.0,562.0, And those priorities can be set by a group consensus.
562.0,574.0," What's going to happen, I think in the next couple of months, is that it'll instead be a case where when you're sitting around at a tutorial table, you'll have one person who saw a game and they're trying to make their case for why that should be, you know, featured coverage."
574.0,578.0, And somebody else who saw another game and they're trying to make their case for why that should be featured coverage.
578.0,579.0, And it's just going to be a clash.
579.0,582.0, There's not going to be a real chance to have common ground on it.
582.0,587.0," Well, then there's going to be a big fight over harvest moon DS cute. Yes."
587.0,588.0, Yes. And Jenga.
588.0,591.0, It's even going to be a challenge for publishers.
591.0,598.0, It only in the sense that the kind of buzz that you could have gotten out of the old E3 by lines and just sort of people gathering.
598.0,606.0," I mean, if we think about the, if we think about the E3 where they showed the melegure sol2 trailer for the first time,"
606.0,617.0," or when EA had a melegure on our ally to salt for the first time, and then 10 to last year with the we, you know, the we's real coming out party was E3 last year."
617.0,635.0," And what I've been saying to, you know, a couple of people I know over at EAM and MTV after seeing rock band at EA's editor's day a few weeks ago is that if this were the old E3 and rock band was in front and center when you walk into South Hall and you see someone on a race stage."
635.0,643.0," And that massive EA oval circular boon playing that game, that would have been rock band would have been the we of this year."
643.0,649.0, And there's no way anyone would be able to leave E3 talking about guitar hero 3. It wouldn't be possible. You talk about rock band.
649.0,663.0," But, you know, now it's these more little intimate experiences where you're in Alex, regardless of sweet over the fair amount, you know, playing and stuff like that, which is what's, it's not always more viral now. You don't get that sense that you got last year."
663.0,675.0," Yeah. Well, I know Sean, you got a sense of a lot of good PC stuff. So let's get on and talk about some games. I mean, let's kick right off by crisis because one of the reasons one of the main reasons that went out to Barker yesterday was to play crisis because."
675.0,684.0," So I was telling you because you were telling me how to do things when we're, when we're arguing after we're not only just arguing what to cover when everyone is arguing. What's the game is show? What's the shooter the show or anything?"
684.0,695.0," And we're all wanting to do it and I was looking online, you know, in the evenings here and I'm seeing this is almost like the, for me, my experiences at this is a show with the shooter because everyone's talking about called duty 2, right?"
695.0,702.0," And about Halo and about Killzone and not not talking about crisis because I just think they don't go to look at it, you know."
702.0,705.0," And that was the only place I was only above hangar, right?"
705.0,723.0," So the thing is when you go there for the first time, they give you access to, you know, the public, the press gets in this case access to a level that comes from the game as opposed to a vertical slice, which is an artificially constructed segment, a snippet of gameplay to indicate."
723.0,744.0," To suggest how some of the features might work in N1, so with this game, it's been around, I mean people are calling it Jesus crisis, it's like, they're so used to say that this is a great looking game and this is, it got to the point where that's all it was known for, that's it's trick. Oh, that's the good looking game, you know, that's a phenomenal looking game and then people want to know, that's worth it."
744.0,755.0," And people are suspicious, it's kind of like, you know, I mean with men or women depending on who you are, if someone looks too good, maybe there's some other deficiency or defect there."
755.0,762.0," And I think that people are kind of like thinking that way and I'm not saying that's true by the way, but I mean, but crisis, the blonde bombshell of games."
762.0,790.0," And I went, and you know, when I was playing it, I had a fantastic time, so yeah, I wanted you to go and experience that to see how your experience with it compared to my had a fantastic, I totally fell in love with the game right off the bat much more so, so here's the big difference, the vertical slice thing was really abstracted, you know, it's like, oh, here's how the guys different nano suit stuff works and here's how you can customize weapons, but it wasn't a cool around with, but yeah, didn't have any sense of coming together."
790.0,796.0," So my first impression from like playing five minutes of it, original first five minutes was wow, this is really a lot like Far Cry."
796.0,800.0," I mean, it probably doesn't help that it's a tropical island."
800.0,807.0," The other one around vehicles roaming around, it's like the most gorgeous game you've ever seen, the water effect is unbelievable."
807.0,818.0," It is so unreal how when you jump into the water, you can see like the way that will light, diffracts through shallow water and you can actually see the bottom real time effect."
818.0,828.0," Just a all-time, all the time effects in there real time effects and as far as I know, there are no what you'd call a technical terms like light map that this is all being handled, you know, in process and real time."
828.0,834.0," So they're like the surface of the water and the, and the way that the fuse light is hitting the the the the riverbed."
834.0,835.0, It's a combination.
835.0,842.0," Yeah, and then their crabs, you go so if a crab skaters across the the flotion floor of the sea bed and you'll actually see the light."
842.0,844.0," Yep, yeah, it could move in such a way as that."
844.0,848.0, It's getting like it's it's very much in shock you stole.
848.0,854.0," Yeah, I was playing in front of me and it was really funny. He's like he's on one of the boats and the boats they've just added."
854.0,862.0," Machine gun turrets to them so you can drive the boats and fire out of them and it that's really fun and cool. He's like he's like, you know, dog fighting."
862.0,864.0," What do you call it when boats are battling anyway? Like, right."
864.0,867.0," Like these, he's fighting these bloodway boats, huh? Bloodway."
867.0,870.0," Yeah, I'm like you see totally bloodwayking these other two boats."
870.0,876.0," And he gets one of them down, but his boat is just about to explode. So he jumps off of his boat right as it explodes."
876.0,884.0," He, uh, and he goes swimming and while he's swimming, the other boats starts chasing him and the tracers from the machine gun fire into the water."
884.0,890.0," He's underwater are going by and doing both like a cavitation effect and then like, you know, the bubbles filling in behind it through the water."
890.0,892.0, So it's like saving private Ryan.
892.0,894.0, It's totally like saving private Ryan.
894.0,896.0, But we're already back to the ground.
896.0,904.0," And they're two. There is. I want to get a gameplay and it's like, we were talking about graphics and I was standing there looking at the monitor and literally had my mouth open like, whoa, whoa."
904.0,910.0," And the gameplay part of it is that the AI is really smart. I mean, here these guys in his boat trying to run him down and chasing with their boat and firing at him in the ground."
910.0,912.0," It's not like, oh, he fell off the boat. He must be gone."
912.0,918.0," For me when I fired it up, like you're saying, it was very much like far cry that that, uh, opening moment where you look."
918.0,924.0," You see a panorama of just this Tahitian type, you know, floor everywhere. Beautiful sea."
924.0,930.0," And you say, okay, what do I do? And the first thing you do is observe. And so in, you know, I begin this demo."
930.0,939.0," I put a scope on my rifle and I look down at the docks. And of course, this would be like the equivalent of one scripted behavior among many that any of the AI is conformed."
939.0,942.0, But so he goes and unzips on the dock and wants to take a leak.
943.0,953.0," Lathably so there's a combustible barrel right next to him. Of course. And so you're like, okay, why is this there? And actually, I asked the Crytek member there and he, because before when I last met with him,"
953.0,956.0," Frankford, there are no combustible barrels. No, no whatsoever."
956.0,964.0," But I guess their testers demanded it or so they're saying, so they're back in there anyway. But so the first time I played this, what it is, I go down into this villa."
964.0,972.0," Well, I snipe the guy and that alerts one of his, his cohort AI who then fires a signal flare into into the sky and someone's another attack chief."
972.0,980.0," It's got a gun on the roof and other guys. And so that time around what I would do is I was just sort of like going to cloaking lay down, be still."
980.0,985.0, Let them go back into a search pattern and then pick them off and then sort of perceive from there.
985.0,990.0, Then I work my way around this horseshoe bay on foot kind of more or less doing the same.
990.0,997.0," And then they just would go by. They wouldn't see me as they would pass, hit them in the back because they'd have a fuel can strap to the back by the tire, hitting blow that up."
997.0,1004.0," But so the second one on on, I mean, that's kind of the deal is that there's so much going on with the AI and it moves so fast and it does it has like a packed mentality."
1004.0,1009.0," They do not just come out and you straight, they'll go and take cover, they'll regroup, they'll try and flank you."
1009.0,1015.0," They call in extra guys, they bring in jeeps with, with, you know, turrets on them like he's talking about."
1015.0,1023.0, And this is like what forces me at least to like go like after the first five minutes to like actually learn how to play crisis because crisis plays really different because of nanosuit.
1023.0,1034.0," And they cleaned up that interface now. It's just like a quick little circle of icons, you jump between, you know, speed or cloak or power mode really, really quickly."
1034.0,1039.0," Yeah, and this is where like, I mean, I might not play the game as crazy,"
1039.0,1064.0," but I think it's like, you know, the, uh, emergently as you do, but what I liked was like as I started to figure out how to do one of these assaults you could like switch to speed, run into a group of guys, take down a couple of them switch to cloak, get out of there when your cloak runs out, go back to speed, get back out of the way, go back, you know, like circle around guys, you could, you could, you could, you felt like you almost like a superhero, you know, you're like diving in attacking them from one side, going away, circling around coming in from another side."
1064.0,1072.0," So if you want one power as another, as effective and previous one, so if you like, if you choose, you can bind each of these to your key, your keyboard."
1072.0,1091.0," So if you want to forego the, the rows that wheel all together, which it actually is pretty effective, you get used to you to press the mouse wheel, right, and then you like, you know, micro move your mouse and you'll, you'll like go over it in, but if you don't want, and I will prefer, I'm sure of it, just hitting a key so that when I want to very quickly go and sprint, pick up some momentum, shift over into power, which is also gives my legs more strength than hit shift and jump with super jump."
1091.0,1105.0," So this way, you can do it with your whole whole jump, coming down off the super jump, I could switch into super strength and be ready to like, and rush through the roof that you've been on as you're descending, or to go to the top."
1105.0,1118.0," So this is, this is like, it is exactly like that, and that's how you start playing the game, and it's like amazing, you get into the zone where you like, speed, cloak, speed, power, power, speed, cloak, you're just diving in and out of battle."
1118.0,1133.0," Keep it trellian, heroes, you have to choose which power, what point you want, but that's, you know, it's one of the time, but this is what I want to talk about my second playthrough, so that was just a preface to say the whole sneaking around the island, because ultimately, I mean, that's one place down, but the second time I said, okay, let's just go super hero."
1133.0,1144.0," So, ran down there and speed, go up to the guy in the docks, which the strength, and then you can grab any person or object whether or not strength is selected, but the strength is pretty obvious what is going to work."
1144.0,1158.0," So, I grabbed the sky by the throat, it's like total Darth Vader, it's total Darth Vader, like grab the dude, you got that moment, right, where you grabbed him, then like had him around the neck and like held him up and you're like, the force, I must kill this."
1158.0,1168.0," So, after I grabbed that guy, actually what I did is, Saul seems brutal, but this is how we only talk about video games and playing shooters, it makes you sound like a mask kit or something, but, say it is to me, say it is sorry."
1168.0,1187.0," So, I took this guy and put his head up against a rock and then started punching the shit out of his face, and then the other guys at that point were shooting, you know, where they were firing at me, so then I turn, use his body, very much like metal gear, but of course this is with the speed and, you know, in the feedback of a first person shooter, so use his body, he's still, I'm still holding by the throat."
1187.0,1198.0," It's crazy, you can tell when they die in this game because people's tongue is lost out of their mouths and stuff, again, this is really like, it's pretty much reverse to if you're not used to playing this game, but this is a rock star game?"
1198.0,1216.0," No, no, so, then I would happen, is I threw the body up through the air and then fired, you're able to quick switch back from my fist to my gun and fire a few more rounds as it's sending, so if I hadn't had strength and I hadn't already pummeled the guy and there's a chance you still alive, which can happen, then you can finish him off that way,"
1216.0,1236.0," throw him into friends, and then so from that moment on, it was like, this epiphany, okay, I, things ideas are just coming to me, so you see enemies retreating into a house because you throw a grenade by him or something, so you go up to the wall next to it and you're like, there's a good chance they're here, punch through the wall, and then what would happen is that the sheet metal, you know, the corrugated wall,"
1236.0,1265.0," and knock them back and then as it collapses back down forward, I've already got my shotgun out and then I blow them through the other wall of the building, or jump up on the roof, and a lot of these are things that you won't see depending on how you play, because depending on who you're watching play, but as you sort of have that aha moment and you think, okay, what about potential jump on the roof, punch down into the roof, you know, I know there's probably weapons in there, then I can use these to fight the guys because they're right out of ammo, and I think also, if you have experience with battlefield time,"
1265.0,1295.0," experience with battlefield type games, and by which I'll include War Hawk, I mean if you're a contone, we play a listening, you've had a battlefield mark on that game, or rock, but the notion that when you get into vehicle, rather than as in gears of war, where you're about to embark on a level where you're just in this vehicle, and it's very important to you, you start looking at them as just tools, and the same way that you might grab a gun, use it for three rounds, find something better and do it, so that could consist of seeing a truck, shooting it up until it starts burning, and then getting in and then goes right back, and then it's just going to be a great opportunity to be able to do it, and then you'll get to the ground, and you'll be able to do it, and then you'll be able to do it, and then you'll be able to do it, and then you'll be able to do it, and then you'll be able to do it,"
1295.0,1314.0," and then you'll be riding that into a group of guys, and having it blow up, going out into the water, the boat, like you were saying, garnet, the thing with the cannon that you're able to control while you're piloting the boat is effective, but the alternate cannon on it by hitting two is even more effective, and so whatever you usually hop up into the turret."
1314.0,1330.0," You switch, and this is something that Battlefield and Quake Wars and players are comfortable doing, with your number keys, switching between positions in any vehicle, because if you don't have a squad in a Jeep, say in your Battlefield, you drive up, hurry up and get on the gun, and hop up as a guy's there trying to put the seat for you."
1330.0,1343.0," So then what you do is you go by the shore, and you see a bunch of guys that pulled up into Jeep, and they're fighting you, switch the game momentum, switch seats, the boat doesn't stop, of course, it continues to bob along, stray fall them, and then get back into the seat and speed the boat back out around."
1343.0,1356.0," So overall, the fun for me is that there's so much versatility in the gameplay, or rewarded for experimentation, even to the point where you can ram a palm tree and have that fall over and hit someone and smash them."
1356.0,1368.0," However, for all the excitement, I did want to cover my ass and say that there are some very obvious AI issues, but they strike me as more of the bug nature, they can resolve."
1368.0,1374.0," I really hope there is all them, and those are, you fire on an enemy, and he doesn't even seem to notice, doesn't return fire."
1374.0,1382.0," So this isn't, you know, this isn't like every encounter you're having, but it happened, you know, if I'm playing in 30 minutes, it might happen to me five or six times, and that's far too much."
1382.0,1395.0," I know you like to experiment with your games a lot, and I think the another game I saw that's going to have a lot of people having new experiences with it is the, I'm not really an expansion, but the next chapter of the company of heroes games, the opposing front."
1395.0,1399.0," I thought you were going to say, by a shock, that's the transition that would work either way."
1399.0,1400.0," Yeah, the company here is, huh?"
1400.0,1409.0," Yeah, because the two knew, and especially the brits, because they showed a lot of the brits, the brits are really going to like change the way this game is played, because they, because they are awesome."
1409.0,1410.0, They are awesome. They are really awesome. They are really awesome.
1410.0,1411.0, We can gas.
1411.0,1415.0," Yeah, apparently, apparently, brits are known to be very tough fighters."
1416.0,1423.0, They changed so much about the way the company of heroes has worked with these guys that playing them is going to be a whole new experience.
1423.0,1432.0," They took out like, like, one of the big deal about all the relic games that they've been doing in, you know, in land based strategy is that your squads gained experience, and they got better."
1432.0,1438.0," And so you started to build this relationship with you when they got rid of that part, and for the brits, because the brits used command and control much more aggressively. So you have a lieutenant."
1438.0,1440.0," Well, it's getting the game. Not like you, Nia."
1441.0,1447.0," You could join in when you visit relic, which is a studio based Vancouver Canada."
1447.0,1450.0," They were like, a composed of an international team."
1450.0,1451.0, Yeah.
1451.0,1453.0," But yeah, we didn't add that city too."
1453.0,1456.0," When you talk to Josh, she was one of the lead designers."
1456.0,1465.0," He immediately breaks it down, and he's like, you know, when, at the moment, Hitler and Axis armies, they weren't really worried about the Americans, because they weren't tested."
1465.0,1471.0," They were the ones who were able to build a studio that they had either as hand-to-to-one on multiple occasions by, you know, about a brits and whatnot."
1471.0,1482.0," And then he's bringing in, you know, how, and the royal blackwatch, you know, groups, and this and that, you know, the infantry regiments, and you could see the pride and then you're bringing in the Canadian efforts to take this city of Con and all this."
1482.0,1491.0," It's cool to see that. And the same way whenever you get a war game, like if you talk to oligmatics who does the, I'll do flight games, you know, he'll be first or mine you did."
1491.0,1495.0, Russia played a little bit of part in that war that we tend to forget.
1495.0,1496.0, Dad bit.
1496.0,1503.0," I think that just that change alone of having, of having officers on the battlefield and the officers have a sphere of influence."
1503.0,1507.0," And so whenever squads gain experience, they funnel it into the officers who in turn gain the rank."
1507.0,1512.0, So you start to have this dynamic of keeping your officers with your squad and keeping them in command and control range.
1512.0,1517.0," And using them as the, and like the lieutenant is meant as like an offensive guy."
1517.0,1522.0," So he gives you a speed boost and you're able to move over more quickly, get into positions better."
1522.0,1528.0," The brits also are able to do all sorts of in placements, so they can really dig in and entrench."
1528.0,1536.0," And when they capture an area, instead of instead of having to go out and then individually capture the supply, depose within that area, they automatically have them."
1536.0,1539.0," It's like, oh, you captured this area and boom, now you have these extra ant."
1539.0,1545.0," So they're very much a, instead of, it's probably a company here, which is always when I played at least been a land grab game."
1545.0,1553.0," It's, it makes it a game where if you're playing the brits, they're probably going to go grab part of the map and then hunker down and say, okay come get me."
1553.0,1562.0," It's such a different game and then, you know, like a command and conquer, you know, the other games that of the other, our tases have come out this year."
1562.0,1572.0," And that there's such an emphasis on the tactics, but then like the, I, I, I, I didn't realize how much I like company of heroes until I played command and conquer three same here."
1572.0,1575.0," And then I was like, oh, yeah, no, I really do like that."
1575.0,1598.0," It's the difference between, you know, being in the war room and moving the pieces around the board and actually like you're saying where you level up when you, when you start to raise the ranks of your captains and lieutenant's and stuff then you start to invest value in specific units and you might have an encounter which involves no more than maybe one one tank, one piece of artillery and maybe a, you know, a couple riflemen and it, it's like you're completely focused on it."
1598.0,1601.0," Whereas in CNC, that's just one little thing that's just fun."
1601.0,1615.0," And you can just let the, let the AI sort of, and the rock paper scissors resolve it for itself, but in this game you've got these guys, and you're like, I'm going to put him micromanagement, usually used, you know, as a, as a knock against something, but I think it works so well here because you never have so many troops."
1615.0,1620.0," You get to get to that's the feeling close and play and the other, the other armies may really cool to play with, that's the pans or elites."
1620.0,1627.0," And the pants are really, it's our badass and one of the, so the big deal here is what they've been able to do is now you can mount a squad into a vehicle."
1627.0,1635.0," And the squad maintains its fighting capabilities. So this is really important because it's basically mechanized, you know, the origins of mechanized assault."
1635.0,1648.0," You can load these squads into these half tracks and you know, just go trek into a battle and the guys are back there in the back of the half track, lean it up the side with their, whatever their pans are, shrack or their machine gun or whatever."
1648.0,1655.0," That's the new thing too is because you could always mount, you know, you can always like load vehicles up with units and one up, but it's a nice, that's like a mobile and placement."
1655.0,1660.0," A fire from it. Yeah, now it's like basically you've taken an placement and you can drive it around the battlefield."
1660.0,1664.0," So you guys feel like, company here is now the gold standard for RTS."
1664.0,1673.0," It definitely is in my mind. Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, they've said that actually ironically, I read a quote, we're one of the relevant guys, such you know, this is the game now that people are going to measure there."
1673.0,1679.0," And I thought I was like, well, it's pretty proud and he can say it only ones, but you know, it's if other people are going to feel it."
1680.0,1694.0," It's a very good thing. I think it's gone there. It's it's it's already become the yardstick, I think everything gets compared to it. I mean, people are talking about Halo was using company heroes and frame that framework."
1694.0,1704.0," So well, that would be such a better decision. I believe. Then to go with the age of empires format since it's going to, you know, a console and stuff, you know, do you think it's going to affect the reception of starcraft, too?"
1705.0,1712.0," It's hard to say, well, it will in my mind for certain, but I mean, it's not going to affect the sales starcraft sales, but yeah, I know."
1712.0,1718.0," Because it's kind of the challenges like now when you have games that end up sort of being advanced, like for instance, like,"
1718.0,1724.0," you're now seeing this year on the console side, the God of War Rippoffs, right?"
1724.0,1732.0, Oh yeah. And you're going to start to see it towards like the end of this year next year is like the game. So gears was derived from RE4.
1732.0,1738.0," And now the gears is, you know, is way beyond what RE4 is. Like, you know, you're going to see that sort of influence. And that's what I'm sort of saying."
1738.0,1744.0," And like the guys of Blizzard, they have so much money and so much free, so much time to do what they want. We have no doubt they'll make the game they want."
1744.0,1750.0," I'm sort of curious. It's like, when it what happens when it affects the expectation of the gamer, right?"
1750.0,1756.0," So it's so hard. You know, it's just having a discussion with Paul Wedgewood who's making Quake Wars this afternoon."
1756.0,1766.0," And it kind of came to the same thing as that once you have an successful, you know, multiplayer and competitive game, whether it's strategy or shooter or anything,"
1766.0,1772.0," it kind of just hits the stasis where all that the, the, the diehard players will accept is the same but looking better."
1772.0,1778.0," And it's exactly what's happening with, you know, of course with Starcraft, and it's basically locked into that position."
1778.0,1784.0," And, and company here is was able to new franchise was able to come in and do all this stuff in the same way that, you know, battlefield and flashpoint where it would come in,"
1784.0,1789.0," where it's at the same time if you would dare put a vehicle in Quake 3 or something, the attorney players would,"
1789.0,1795.0," yeah, strong you up, you know, so it's just, um, I think they're space for both but yeah, I mean,"
1795.0,1804.0," I won't be able to play Starcraft too, like you're saying, and not having my mind, the other options that have been, that other companies, you know, such as real estate."
1804.0,1820.0," I'm not sure that Starcraft 2 is such a good example because it's such a unique position by virtue of its popularity in Korea, by virtue of its acceptance as, as a, like a paradigm of real time strategy games that were they to go in a whole other direction."
1820.0,1822.0," It really, would it even be Starcraft?"
1822.0,1829.0," But I think on the level of control that you haven't company heroes, I think that that is a challenge for stock right, and that people have now, I mean,"
1829.0,1835.0," company heroes did a K, I mean, it wasn't a huge seller, it did like, I mean, worldwide, there will be a couple hundred thousand units."
1835.0,1841.0," Yeah, but it made enough as an impact, that the people that really like that kind of game are now able to, you know,"
1841.0,1846.0," I mean, after they've played the expansion, able to put a unit and have six guys fighting out of the back of it."
1846.0,1853.0," Well, I'm opposed to stand alone, I hope that, you know, I hope that some of the company heroes buzz that got out there and maybe people who, like,"
1853.0,1857.0," stood on the fence before will now come in and say, you know what, I'm going to check out this game,"
1857.0,1863.0," I'm going to try opposing front. And I think if they get opposing front, so probably wind up buying company heroes and they end also."
1863.0,1867.0," And all that talk, it's got a great single player campaign to you."
1867.0,1870.0," Yeah, actually, they said the single player campaign, this is longer than the one."
1870.0,1872.0," It's like one's long. Yeah, it's like longer than the original game."
1872.0,1875.0," So it's, they've busted their home as sequel, right?"
1875.0,1878.0," It's, you know what they're doing is they're doing like what shooter games have been doing for a long time."
1878.0,1883.0," They say, you know what, we've got this established franchise, we have a established engine, let's make the next chapter of content,"
1883.0,1888.0," whereas the real time strategy game, the genre has been always been caught up in, well, when you make a game,"
1888.0,1892.0, you make one expansion pack and then you move on to make the next iteration of the engine.
1892.0,1899.0," And because in the past, they had to put so much, every iteration of the engine had to have a massive logic and AI up, right,"
1899.0,1905.0," whereas they're kind of at a point now where it's pretty, you know, they're not so worried about path finding being broken,"
1905.0,1907.0, the way they used to be in a command and conquer.
1908.0,1915.0," And the difference with the expansion to the stand-loads, they're probably just sick of knowing that you can only say if they sold 200,000 copies of a company here,"
1915.0,1922.0," it was knowing that they can never sell any more than that of this, when at least there's some chance of this darsaline in the right way that they might sell more."
1922.0,1926.0," Yeah, all that time and money into building this great engine, everyone acknowledges is great."
1926.0,1930.0, It's just keep cranking out on that and not spending the money on development.
1930.0,1931.0, I think they're on the right front there.
1931.0,1936.0," I wouldn't be surprised to see them move, you know, this franchise into the eastern front possibly next."
1936.0,1940.0," You know, take the same engine, move into the, we were just talking about how important Russia was."
1940.0,1943.0," And I'm certainly, the percent of it."
1943.0,1944.0, I was where I was going to go.
1944.0,1948.0," I mean, certainly this game, the way it plays would be like the first guys who could really go in and do something like EWA-GEMA"
1948.0,1955.0," and make it really, really intense and, and, I mean, they could take the engine and they could apply it to non-historical stuff as well."
1955.0,1960.0," They could show this, you know, I mean, where I like they've got, you know, the donna war stuff,"
1960.0,1969.0," if you took the game as it is and you changed the, the panzers and the shurmans to, you know, war hogs and race and stuff, it would be, I mean, it would still be phenomenal."
1969.0,1971.0," Yeah, it would be a bad ass Halo Wars."
1971.0,1973.0," It would, yeah, it would be an incredible Halo Wars."
1973.0,1974.0, We were talking about sequels.
1974.0,1980.0," You got to see one that, that I'm kind of curious to see what's happening with it and we're just going to call it, I guess, not fear to."
1980.0,1981.0, Okay.
1981.0,1982.0, Yeah.
1982.0,1983.0," How's that, how's that, and shape it up?"
1983.0,1985.0," You know, did you, did you see that too?"
1985.0,1986.0, Okay.
1986.0,1996.0," Well, when I went in there, the first thing that's, that's running is just this trailer reel, you know, to show you just a few scenes, is there about to set up the, the hands on demonstration, right?"
1996.0,2008.0," And at first I was like, is this the same design team because one of the shadiest look in mechs I've ever seen comes out around a corner and it's supposed to be like utterly menacing, but it was, I mean, it wasn't even like, you know, power range was really bad."
2008.0,2015.0," And they actually had some, the, the, the mechs in fear are, are interesting exosuits, you know, it's a combination hand both."
2015.0,2024.0," It does not, but they weren't, they weren't the kind that would be hanging in the 99 cent store, you know, like on a peg with a, and this one really had that vibe to it."
2024.0,2028.0," But so, the thing they'll color plastic with the tabs for it was not so mold still on there."
2028.0,2032.0," Yeah, so not to linger in that, but what happened is when they turned it on, it wasn't anything like that at all."
2032.0,2034.0," I mean, that must have been from a later level."
2034.0,2037.0," I can just go right through the whole thing really, really quickly."
2037.0,2039.0, You wake up moments after the ending of fear one.
2039.0,2040.0, I don't know.
2040.0,2044.0," You had this thing with spoilers in your audience, maybe I better not say how fear one ends in case someone is still going to get it."
2044.0,2047.0," But anyway, it happens when we're in the center of that."
2047.0,2054.0," I want to know. Okay. So big explosion, right blows up the Auburn areas with the call, the setting of the game."
2054.0,2057.0, And you wake up on in a surgery theater.
2057.0,2059.0," And at first, things seem normal."
2059.0,2063.0," Guys are worried about keeping your, your pulse going and they're performing various things."
2063.0,2067.0," And then it, all of a sudden it starts flashing into, you know, all turn of vision."
2067.0,2069.0, The old silent hill type thing.
2069.0,2071.0," Yeah. And that they employed, um,"
2071.0,2074.0," some of what's successfully in the first, in the first fear game."
2074.0,2080.0," And then, of course, instead of, you know, nimbley working a scalpel and surranges and, and whatnot, they're just gouging and tearing into you."
2080.0,2083.0," And it's just this, this, a ball and we'll see and blood's flying everywhere."
2083.0,2087.0," And this happens for a while. And it's pretty cool. I mean, they keep the tension up."
2087.0,2095.0," But then, um, you have a vision of Alma, the little devil dog girl from, you know, the ring is obviously really stroller."
2095.0,2102.0," Um, and you see her, you wake up and at that point, from then on, something is clearly, has happened to you."
2102.0,2107.0, And you're fighting the delta team that you fought alongside in the other game.
2107.0,2112.0," And in the demonstration there, it's, it's all in, in the hospital and working your way out of it."
2112.0,2117.0," And so while you're fighting, which is a thing, you know, because the problem with the first fear that we had,"
2117.0,2121.0," we all agree, excellent AI, some of the best. They don't use scripted AI at all."
2121.0,2129.0," It's all the time in the game. And the gun fights, the fire fights, and just the, the feedback you get from firing weapons from, you know, destroying the environment stuff is great."
2129.0,2133.0," And they basically said, hey, that worked. Let's do that again. And the environment."
2133.0,2137.0," So it's, you know, the office parks, like at some point, I want something different."
2137.0,2146.0," So here, it was, yet again, another sterile environment this time literally. And as you're playing, um, it was hard not to, to get back into the, okay,"
2146.0,2154.0," this is a cool game, and I want to play it because every, you're watching the AI do great things. You're, you know, throwing a grenade, kicking into slow motion."
2154.0,2165.0," You know, the bolt on again. And you know, just a few new weapons, there's this laser sort of like rather than, you know, the, the tattoo I want in a cure that just like cuts right through things."
2165.0,2171.0," Yeah, it also, it will trace a line everywhere it goes and start a fire and leave a burning thing, but then it will."
2171.0,2179.0," I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop though, I mean, because you're like setting this up and the other shoes coming isn't it something is, but no, um, maybe not."
2179.0,2192.0," And that was kind of cool because so as you art this laser cross everyone, they catch on fire. The AI now seeks to extinguish itself. If there's water anywhere, they're going to run to that otherwise they just put on this crazy deathdance and go down."
2192.0,2205.0," But yeah, that there was nothing really happened exceptional that made it, this was fear. And, and that was part of my concern is like this is, it's not a bad game, by any means. It was an enjoyable game, but it's not a triple A game for the reasons that we explain."
2205.0,2214.0," And the other thing, the way we have to be concerned with now is that Vennie still owns the technical, the title fear, right? And Monolith is now with Warner Brothers making a fear game."
2214.0,2227.0," Vennie just announced fear files. And what happens is when you have this game that was already so limited in what it did excel that. And now you're having multiple versions of it with different competing publishers and things. I think they're just going to, that you've seen fear files."
2227.0,2237.0," They're going to saturate it. Just enough where I walked and watched so I'm playing it and I was like, this could have been the other game, you know, although this is Monolith's game. So I trust them there, the original creators diep."
2237.0,2249.0," Yeah, it was interesting. It's kind of one of those weird things. It's like they don't need to give any indication of like what they're the high level of what they're really trying to do with it. And is there anything new they're bringing the table?"
2249.0,2263.0," They even say pretty much flat out. You know, sometimes you get someone that makes a movie like Rambo or something and they say, well, yeah, it's a movie about stuff that blows up, you know, and there's insofar as possible, we might dig into some other things."
2263.0,2275.0," And they said, this is a game about AI and Firefights. We did that well. The other stuff is sort of a, you know, the horror elements are like a palette cleanser in between the main course and on a politics."
2275.0,2290.0," And that's what video games, you know, of the politics for it. Not to get in with gears of words, you know, and that's the same thing. This is, you know, remember Chris Rock at the at the Oscars and he goes to the theater and says, what's your favorite movie?"
2290.0,2302.0," They're like aliens versus predator. Not a single person to scene any of the movies that were up for for words that year, you know, it's kind of like that. I mean, there's certain directors that, yeah, this is what we do. This is what we make. We're not going to be ashamed of it."
2302.0,2312.0," It's cool to have fun with it. So before we get out of the PC arena, I want to make sure and hit on to me on guyshell saw, which is the Ed Tech demo. So how's it looking?"
2312.0,2338.0," The Ed Tech demo is looking pretty sweet. I mean, it was pretty much the demo that they showed at the Mac event. Okay, with jobs. So what was interesting was they had it running on PC Mac Xbox 360 and PS3. Wow. We're all set up all simultaneously. So you walk into this long white room vaguely 2000 on one ish and there's a couch at one end."
2338.0,2353.0, There's a demo area at the other end where they're showing the tools and there's just this long table with the machine set up and it's running it on each of those things. You could sort of jump in it. Remember they're showing that sort of racing looks very much like motor storm.
2353.0,2365.0, So I talked with John Carmack and he was saying the reason they showed that was because they wanted to prove to potential licensees since those are the people that are meeting with that they can do how doors.
2365.0,2378.0," They said, look, we can say if we've showed this to people and they get it, they'll trust us on indoors because we've been doing indoors for years. They'll provide that. But if we just show people indoors and say, oh, we can do outdoors, they're going to be suspicious. So that's what they're showing."
2378.0,2393.0," It's an evolution of the Megataxter tech from Quake Wars. And you know, looks pretty good, but that was the main thing. The more interesting thing was who was coming through to meet with what I was there."
2393.0,2407.0," So there were a couple of people from EA who were in there. I saw Frank Jibot and Singen Bane. So Singen's from EA partners, which is, you know, they're working with the Rock Band guys from MTV."
2407.0,2420.0," So it's a people who EA doesn't own, but they publish the games like Valve and CryTac and those guys. And you know, so the speculation kind of mounts because it's deal with activation is up."
2420.0,2428.0," So yeah, so you know to compliment that when I last spoke with the company, I mean the company of the company of duty."
2428.0,2440.0," And I was asking, are you going to use the Singen? And there was a lot of laughter and nervousness. And what I got out of it was that maybe Activision had big plans for it. So there might be the other piece of the puzzle there."
2440.0,2446.0," Right. I mean, I couldn't, you know, obviously they're talking to publishers and talking to a variety of publishers."
2446.0,2458.0," And so I spoke with Todd Hollensad, who's the biz guy. There and they're trying to figure it out. Clearly they have a lot of options. You know, they're not ruling out Activision at all. They're not really signaling any which way direction they're going to go."
2458.0,2467.0," The one thing I started to get him to say is, are you thinking about housing all your games at single publisher like you did before or with multiple publishers."
2467.0,2483.0," Any point out the pros of cons and cons of either side for the impression I get is that they're leaning towards a deal with a single publisher again and just sort of figuring out who that's going to be. And if you look at, you know, the kinds of companies that are."
2483.0,2498.0," And it's so hard now for developers to stay independent. So many of them are getting snapped up. And the ones who are still able to do it are the guys who made their money on PC games like those prime PC guys. So the valves and, you know, epic and now it."
2498.0,2511.0," And I don't, I definitely did not get the impression they want to sell out. You know, saying they still want to be in control of their destiny. So it'll be interesting to see sort of who ponies up the money to get that. But, you know, with with Frank. I mean, EA partners reports into Frank."
2511.0,2519.0," I didn't over here the conversations that could have been some of that, but I think they were definitely being shown the tools. So you have to imagine, I mean, EA's licensing unreal."
2519.0,2523.0," You know, they have whatever don't render where they don't render where."
2523.0,2538.0," And, you know, my guess is that EA does not want to be tools dependent on anyone company. So they're going to do that. The last thing real quick is what John was saying is the tools are definitely much, much friendlier than they were in the past."
2538.0,2554.0," And, I mean, John was definitely sort of giving a me a culpa on how they'd approached in the past where because he was so responsible for the programming. He was like, look, I mean, my time program or time is more valuable than artists time ultimately for the good of the project."
2554.0,2567.0," And so learn how to edit a text file. Well, now artists have tools that are used to because you guys remember from when Mark Reyn and those guys were showing that those were one of the things they stressed and one of the things that publishers really love about unreal tech."
2567.0,2575.0," Even as they're dealing with the growing pains as it sort of, you know, it epic gets its tack ready for the various platforms."
2575.0,2583.0, Is the tools everyone loves the tools. And so these tools were definitely definitely from what I could over here. It looked like people were pretty impressed with the tool side of it.
2583.0,2589.0," But even though they're going to do, you know, they're improved the tools, they'll do better support and things like that."
2590.0,2604.0," The way they portrayed is ultimately, that's a side benefit of them needing to approach the tools in this way to be able to build once-ish and have it run on multiple platforms because they see their future is not just PC only."
2604.0,2612.0," It's on these multiple platforms. So it's not like you just build the game on PC and it automatically runs on PS3, but you're not going to need to baby it as much."
2613.0,2620.0," I mean, they're from what they were portraying it as is that their artists didn't even actually know that it was up and running on PS3."
2620.0,2624.0," You know what I'm saying? It's just sort of like, but the art and assets like all that stuff comes over."
2624.0,2629.0," So, especially right now because for an EA, a set up like that makes so much sense."
2629.0,2637.0," I mean, you're looking at multi platform development and how many publishers or how many developers in the last few months have you heard complaining about how hard it is,"
2637.0,2641.0, especially if they start on 360 to get their code running on PS3.
2641.0,2647.0," If that problem is solved at a base fundamental tool level, especially for EA who does lots of multi-platform stuff,"
2647.0,2650.0," to be like, yeah, that was worth the money we spent on it."
2650.0,2655.0, Definitely. So I think there'll be a lot of interest in it. It looked good.
2655.0,2662.0," Cool. Unfortunately, they're showing the first game. They weren't showing the first game that will run on the technology here, but at QuakeCon."
2662.0,2666.0, Exactly. So they're definitely trying to get us to all to come out there and check it out.
2666.0,2670.0," Hey, can you blame him? I mean, it's quite con. It's celebration of all things in it."
2670.0,2673.0, Right? That's the place where it's something like that should debut. Absolutely.
2673.0,2678.0," It makes sense. There's other thing too with this show is that if you're not, and that would have been a top dog."
2678.0,2684.0," But if you're, if, I mean, there's so much noise going on and you want your signal to get through, I mean, QuakeCon,"
2684.0,2689.0," it's called QuakeCon, right? You know, and you're looking at, and the world pays attention instead of, you know,"
2689.0,2693.0, argues whether or not there's quite as good as this other game or this other one.
2693.0,2697.0," They'll have their audience, they'll be captive, they'll be already to rock and roll, and there you go."
2697.0,2701.0," So what we leave out, the only thing we left out was your little half-life to drop."
2701.0,2704.0," It'll have life to and the buyer's shock, and we're probably running a time."
2704.0,2709.0," But the, the, the, the Quake thing I learned about in half-life, should be it no surprise to anyone, but, um,"
2709.0,2716.0," well, of course, the Orange Box episode, um, two team fortress to portal or on track. They're going to be out here this fall."
2717.0,2730.0," Um, but the episode three, it, most likely will not be out in 2008, not even the, but the reason, um, for this is that it's going to be this grand finale for the trilogy of episodes."
2730.0,2735.0," And because it's going to be bigger in this night, it's going to be, it was originally going to be through."
2735.0,2743.0," I think, right, it was, it was from the beginning, it was planned as, as a trilogy of these episodes, but it's also going to be like all new locations and stuff."
2743.0,2750.0," So the reason that they're not going to be, you know, episode one, reused, you know, a great deal of assets from Half-Life 2 proper."
2750.0,2755.0," So since this is not the case, it's not just a matter of creating a couple new enemy types or behavior."
2755.0,2761.0, Basically what they're doing is they're making half-life to two expansion packs and then Half-Life 3.
2761.0,2768.0," But they're not, they're not expansion packs, you know, I mean, like from one I've played of this game that's on the show for,"
2768.0,2770.0, how are they doing with everything else?
2770.0,2781.0," It's just a short game, but it's like a full, I don't know, I mean, do you consider that when you get, when you pick up that orange box that you're getting an expansion pack?"
2781.0,2784.0," Yeah, yeah, it's very much like what you get an expansion pack."
2784.0,2789.0," I mean, I can compare it to like one of the most popular expansion pack all time, which would be the Diablo 2 out on."
2789.0,2795.0," And it's exactly like that new campaign, new classes, all sorts of new stuff to do and and changes in the game."
2795.0,2797.0, You have a graphics upgrade.
2797.0,2805.0," What if you have also though the difference between the expansion packs for Half-Life 1 is that if you have a narrative, you know, in the story-centric game."
2805.0,2816.0," And instead of telling a side mission or looking at the, you know, the Rosencran's skill and stern thing, you know, you're actually just progressing with your game plan from the beginning."
2816.0,2822.0," This is going to move this whole universe ahead and this is going to, you know, we're not saving big revelation."
2822.0,2823.0, That's the first thing that did that.
2823.0,2824.0, Prudewood did that.
2824.0,2825.0, Brudewood.
2825.0,2826.0," Yeah, I mean, okay."
2826.0,2827.0, Maybe it does.
2827.0,2833.0," I'm just thinking of it all the mountain enjoyment I got from episode one and then imagining, like putting that together with Team Fortress 2, which I would have gotten."
2833.0,2836.0, I got a table or join one of the game.
2836.0,2837.0," I mean, I haven't been there."
2837.0,2838.0, I have talked about how much I enjoyed.
2838.0,2840.0, I have really really enjoyed episode one.
2840.0,2847.0," I just, you know, why, why even downly around with calling, they, they projected the vision originally about episode at gaming."
2847.0,2852.0, That it was going to free up their production teams because they weren't going to get stuck in those big cycles.
2852.0,2858.0," And within two episodes now they're back to saying, well, we know, maybe we really like to make those big games."
2858.0,2861.0, And I applaud them for that because I like it when they make that game.
2861.0,2862.0, Yeah.
2862.0,2863.0, I like it when they do that.
2863.0,2870.0," There's no doubt about about that that they, I mean, what they promoted as their plan for episodic gaming has just completely vanished."
2870.0,2871.0, And they've changed tack.
2871.0,2872.0," But I mean, I don't know."
2872.0,2880.0," Do I mind getting, you know, every two years somehow life or would I rather just wait for six years for the next game?"
2880.0,2883.0," Yeah, whatever for these guys and the dev cycles that we're on the past."
2883.0,2885.0," I mean, this is pretty, this is pretty, yeah."
2885.0,2887.0," This is like doing, you know, a weekly show."
2887.0,2889.0, Definitely just for these guys.
2889.0,2893.0," The thing that's interesting is that they point, there were a lot of objectives within."
2893.0,2896.0, So they've introduced new technologies.
2896.0,2897.0, Yep.
2897.0,2899.0," Things like that. I mean, wasn't episode one where they introduced HDR lighting."
2899.0,2902.0," Well, they had like that special little add-on level even before that."
2902.0,2904.0," So yeah, but they did use HDR and then in the first year."
2904.0,2907.0," Yeah. So it's gotten them on, you know, a bit of a speeded up process."
2907.0,2913.0," I mean, even with, you know, I was talking to, I forgetting his name now, but they're a biz guy."
2913.0,2920.0," And he was sort of, we were looking at the animated stuff, just the way that Team Fortress 2 looks."
2920.0,2922.0, And the remember the thing they did with the heavy gunner.
2922.0,2923.0, Yeah.
2923.0,2927.0," And sort of saying, like, hey, is that an experiment for animated stuff?"
2927.0,2930.0, You guys might do when he sort of winked and nodded.
2930.0,2931.0, Kind of changing.
2931.0,2933.0," Yeah. I mean, they're just, it's such a creative shop."
2933.0,2936.0, There's so many things and directions they can go with.
2936.0,2944.0, I think it was ultimately a way for them to keep putting out content in a way that even if it seems slow to us
2944.0,2948.0, was definitely faster than it took them to do Half-Life 2 after Half-Life 1.
2948.0,2954.0, The thing is that I just think we're all sort of still holding out hope that they find a way to sort of get back to
2954.0,2958.0, with the originally said episodic gaming was going to be.
2958.0,2962.0, But I think we should just now accept that that's not what they are.
2962.0,2963.0, That's not what they're going to do.
2963.0,2966.0," It'll, it'll have to be some other developer that gives us that vision."
2966.0,2969.0," Yeah. No, I agree. And I don't even know that I agree with that part."
2969.0,2972.0," I don't know if I agree with wanting them to even go, ever go back to that part."
2972.0,2974.0, I love when they make Half-Life.
2974.0,2976.0, Those games are awesome.
2976.0,2980.0," And they are, both of them completely worth the weight, completely worth the weight."
2980.0,2982.0, So hopefully we'll only be waiting too long.
2982.0,2985.0, Something else we'll quick on that is that when you're talking about the
2985.0,2991.0," expressive animations and stuff or the faces, they're actually sinking that to the voice over IP"
2991.0,2995.0," so that when you're in a game and you're talking to a friend, you know, like I can run up with my character"
2995.0,2999.0, and this of course was an option and team-ports classic that they had.
2999.0,3003.0," But it wasn't synced with this, you know, degree of detail and everything."
3003.0,3007.0," But so that should just be fun right there. I mean, just not just much of a lot of stuff."
3007.0,3009.0," But so instead of reverse blue, you know,"
3009.0,3012.0," you're wearing a six-room-ath moves, when you're talking to each other."
3012.0,3013.0," Yeah, we were playing around with that one."
3013.0,3017.0," But so instead of the Nutcracker puppet, you know, jaw, hinge jaw going up and down,"
3017.0,3020.0," you're going to see, you know, eyebrows lifting and things like this."
3020.0,3025.0, I don't know what extent I'm sure there's going to be mismatch depending on like how loud or the frequency of your eye.
3025.0,3026.0, You that you're communicating.
3026.0,3030.0," But it should be pretty funny and it allowed a lot to, definitely."
3030.0,3034.0, You got an early choice for a game of the show before you take out a here's on.
3034.0,3038.0," I never, I only, I mean, I only have a personal, I'm not sure."
3038.0,3039.0, Really personal.
3039.0,3044.0," And it's like, I think both by a shock in crisis were the most, you know, impressive and exciting games for me."
3044.0,3046.0," This, this year."
3046.0,3047.0, That's cool.
3047.0,3048.0," Well, thanks for hanging out with us."
3048.0,3050.0," Hopefully we won't keep you waiting too long,"
3050.0,3052.0," when we take a quick break and when we come back on the other side,"
3052.0,3054.0," we'll dive back into some console stuff, bring Shane back in,"
3054.0,3056.0, see if we can turn away from the pool.
3056.0,3057.0, The man got.
3057.0,3058.0," Yeah, stick around."
3058.0,3059.0, We'll be right back.
3069.0,3073.0, This one up podcast is brought to you by Windows Media Center.
3073.0,3080.0," Your Xbox 360, your music, your photos, your TV shows and your videos with one connection."
3080.0,3097.0," Alright, and we're back and I will probably be the first person to take this fall because after getting some credibility or, you know,"
3097.0,3108.0," some credit, at least on calling the Sony PS3 coming out party here at E3, what the hell happened this morning and last night?"
3108.0,3109.0, I don't understand.
3109.0,3114.0," Well, this is what we're talking about is the announcement that the 60 gig skew,"
3114.0,3118.0," which has been lowered to 4999, well, that's being cleared out and that's, you know,"
3118.0,3121.0," stopping being made and after that, you won't be able to buy that anymore."
3121.0,3126.0, So presumably the only skew then is the 599 skew with motor storm.
3126.0,3128.0, And it's causing people to freak out.
3128.0,3130.0," They're like, well, it's not real price drop anymore."
3130.0,3131.0, It's not a real price drop.
3131.0,3133.0," But okay, here's what I think is going to happen."
3133.0,3139.0," I think there will be no point at which you won't be, you will always be able to go to a store in via PS3 for 4999."
3139.0,3140.0, That is going to keep bumping it down.
3140.0,3141.0," They're going to like, pot it."
3141.0,3143.0, This allows them to make it and then like a fake price cut.
3143.0,3146.0," So like when that model's gone, then they lower the 599,"
3146.0,3147.0, I wonder 4999.
3147.0,3150.0, I think this is the trend of this generation because this has got to begin.
3150.0,3153.0," I mean, we talked about this before we three, this has got to be coming from Microsoft as well."
3153.0,3156.0," They will be 399 soon, right?"
3156.0,3158.0, This year definitely.
3158.0,3160.0," And I think, yeah, I think you're right."
3160.0,3162.0, But like what's so need to supposed to do today?
3162.0,3166.0," And now it's that, oh yes, on October 31st, we're going to lower the 599 to 499 now."
3166.0,3170.0," Of course, but remember, they were all the analysts that said, you know, Michael Packter,"
3170.0,3173.0," was saying that, you know, he expected Microsoft to cut price this week."
3173.0,3174.0, They didn't.
3174.0,3177.0," So then he had to sort of retract and say, well, he was wrong."
3177.0,3182.0," And the thing is, is that Microsoft doesn't yet even before"
3182.0,3187.0, they sort of took back the price cut that they had made Sony.
3187.0,3191.0, Microsoft doesn't have to cut price in response to Sony.
3191.0,3193.0, I don't think almost at any point this year.
3193.0,3196.0," Like I don't think the, and you will be able to play high,"
3196.0,3199.0," like 1, 299 dollar device to see it."
3199.0,3202.0," The question is, is it a premium or is it, you know, the core?"
3202.0,3207.0," My thing is, I don't know that Microsoft is going to adjust price that much."
3207.0,3210.0," They don't, what they need to do is just their own business, their own numbers."
3210.0,3214.0, And my guess is that Microsoft wants to hold out as long as possible and see what impact
3214.0,3217.0, the release of Halo 3 has on their sales.
3217.0,3221.0," And if that goose is done to the extent that they think, then why make the price cut this year?"
3221.0,3226.0," I had previously thought that they might face out the core, but Patrick Leppic and I said,"
3226.0,3227.0, now we're Shane came yesterday.
3227.0,3232.0," Now we were talking about how one of the themes of this show is,"
3232.0,3236.0, the ways of tackling the mainstream and broadening the demographic.
3236.0,3238.0, And all three of the platform holders have a very different strategy.
3238.0,3240.0, You have an intent on doing their thing.
3240.0,3246.0," And then you have Sony who is trying to position the device itself as the main streaming of gaming,"
3246.0,3248.0, because it does so much.
3248.0,3250.0," And then Microsoft, the kind of caught in the middle."
3250.0,3254.0," The one thing that he referenced several times was that, you know,"
3254.0,3257.0," to be mainstream, to be mainstream, it's driven by price."
3257.0,3260.0," You know, as much as any, you can say anything about creative,"
3260.0,3261.0, but prices what drives it.
3261.0,3265.0," And the, you know, the core is where they're going to play in that,"
3265.0,3269.0," you know, the way they'll do, they'll tackle ways with the core."
3269.0,3270.0, This is the same thing I've heard.
3270.0,3274.0," Yeah, is that the core will stick around, that will still be experiences that don't need the hard drive,"
3274.0,3277.0, and that they'll drive the price of the core down as cheap as they possibly can.
3277.0,3279.0, So somehow we switch gears and start talking about Microsoft.
3279.0,3281.0, I'm not ready to leave the Sony.
3281.0,3283.0," Oh, so I mean, I don't buy Shane's theory."
3283.0,3285.0," You see, it's like I totally don't want to."
3285.0,3288.0," They did not want to let us get out that, that is stopping production,"
3288.0,3291.0," and you know, it's a snap we did that got out, but I think you're, you're not a snap."
3291.0,3292.0, I think you're foolish.
3292.0,3295.0," If you think the Sony's going to raise the price of place, it's not raising the price."
3295.0,3297.0, They are clearing product out.
3297.0,3298.0, They've done this before.
3298.0,3301.0, They did the same thing when they switched from the big PS2 to the PS2 many.
3301.0,3303.0, But I think I think he's right.
3303.0,3305.0, I think that they'll clear this out.
3305.0,3309.0," And now, because if you think about, I mean, what's actually happening here is a 20 gig"
3309.0,3313.0," extra hard drive, which is virtually no price whatsoever."
3313.0,3316.0," You know, to them on the cost side, I mean, you know, it's, it's nothing."
3316.0,3320.0," A copy of a storm, a game of the ship, you know, they've shipped a million units over."
3320.0,3321.0, It's the first party game.
3321.0,3325.0," It's the first party game, the unit price on a blurry game is, is like, I mean, it's not"
3325.0,3328.0," sense that some people have said, it is a couple of bucks to manufacture a blurry"
3328.0,3332.0," risk. It's an expensive duplication process, but it's only a few dollars."
3332.0,3337.0," And they've taken the emotion engine out, so the device itself is less of a device."
3337.0,3341.0," Like right now, if you want to pay us three and you want full backwards compatibility,"
3341.0,3345.0, go buy one of the 499 ones now because it is your last chance.
3345.0,3347.0, Where are people chuckling at me when I said that?
3347.0,3348.0, What?
3348.0,3349.0, Post that that was the time to go buy one.
3349.0,3353.0," So you could get one with the emotion engine in it, but they're like, oh, I don't"
3353.0,3355.0, play PS2 games. I don't know. I have a pretty big PS2 library.
3355.0,3359.0," Well, let's go to something that Shane said. So unfortunately, and then not contradicting,"
3359.0,3362.0," you know, I'm just sort of like, I have some additional color information."
3362.0,3365.0, I did an interview with Cosur I yesterday at 915 AM.
3365.0,3370.0," By about 925, he was telling me exactly what David Reeve said."
3370.0,3375.0," Either around the same time or later in the UK that just kind of, you know, broke out"
3375.0,3379.0," and, you know, it's catching all this attention. And I was, you know, I'm being shot."
3379.0,3382.0, I was shot. So I'm sitting in an interview with Cosur I.
3382.0,3386.0," And he's saying this like, directly and matter of factly,"
3386.0,3389.0, like it's common knowledge and my job was on the floor.
3389.0,3391.0," Like, you didn't think we were going to do this."
3391.0,3393.0, This was up on a loan.
3393.0,3395.0," But, you know, they can't say, oh, but don't worry."
3395.0,3398.0," After that, you'd be able to get this better one for the price of the one that we're trying to"
3398.0,3399.0, go to here.
3399.0,3401.0," Right now, here's the thing though."
3401.0,3404.0," The other thing that I had heard, and this is just often one source."
3404.0,3409.0," But it's what I've been here, what I heard, and I want to run it down with some more people,"
3409.0,3413.0, is that there is a fight.
3413.0,3419.0, There was a fight in Japan about reducing the price on the PS3 at all.
3419.0,3427.0, And that the only way that Cos was able to get the 60 gig reduced to 499 was by introducing
3427.0,3430.0, the 599 80 gig.
3430.0,3431.0, Right?
3431.0,3432.0, And positioning in this way.
3432.0,3435.0, So I'm just sort of wondering if that battle is going on.
3435.0,3438.0," And if he's, and it has to be with Sony Corp, right?"
3438.0,3442.0," You know, so Chubachi, who's the number two, and stringer who's the number one,"
3442.0,3446.0," if that's the case, if that's what's going on, the sort of wonder is Cos just to"
3446.0,3449.0, the company line in public.
3449.0,3454.0," But in private, they're going to assemble the data, show that 499 is the price point at"
3454.0,3455.0, which is moving.
3455.0,3459.0," And then sort of do what you're saying, which is you'll have to excuse,"
3459.0,3463.0, but they'll maybe throw in a little extra something like maybe a PlayStation card when
3463.0,3467.0," they put those out at 599, a lot of motor storm, and then still have the 499 and"
3467.0,3468.0, one which is making.
3468.0,3472.0," That's the one that they're losing, roughly in the neighborhood of $200 per console"
3472.0,3474.0," sold, is that still pretty much an accurate number?"
3474.0,3475.0, No.
3475.0,3476.0, I don't think that's an accurate number anymore.
3476.0,3477.0, What do you have heard?
3477.0,3481.0," Any guess would just be a guess, but the word is, and no one's disputing them on it,"
3481.0,3486.0, is that they've brought down the cost of Ray Ray pretty significantly.
3486.0,3490.0," They've taken out the EE plus GS, which is how they were doing backwards compatibility."
3490.0,3492.0, So that's another cost savings.
3492.0,3496.0," They do parts reductions all the time, so maybe there's a couple of things they kicked out."
3496.0,3503.0," You know, it's possible that at 599, they're close to Ray Keden."
3503.0,3504.0, Possible.
3504.0,3507.0," So here's the way I see it, and it's just different opinions, but here's the way I see it."
3507.0,3511.0, We all agreed that they were under a tremendous amount of third-party publisher pressure
3511.0,3512.0, to get the price down.
3512.0,3519.0," This mechanism of clearing out 60 gigabytes units lets them do that, because basically as far as"
3519.0,3523.0," like accounting wise, these units that are sitting in the channel, whether they're in a Sony"
3523.0,3525.0, warehouse or a store are already on the books.
3525.0,3529.0," So they're already out there, and the sooner they can get that money back and get and put"
3529.0,3530.0, their cash flow back in order.
3530.0,3532.0, And that's about the units in the channel.
3532.0,3533.0, Right.
3533.0,3535.0, And so that's the second part.
3535.0,3540.0," By getting these things to blip before holiday season, they can dramatically improve"
3540.0,3545.0," their install base before those AAA titles hit this fall, which leads to part 3, which is"
3545.0,3552.0," and then, once they have a more critical mass of users out there and great titles, say,"
3552.0,3555.0, here's the 80 gig with this game packed in still it.
3555.0,3556.0, It's a great value at 599.
3556.0,3558.0, Why would they need to lower the price down?
3558.0,3560.0, They've accomplished what they want to do.
3560.0,3561.0, They bumped up there.
3561.0,3562.0, They made a third-party's happy.
3562.0,3567.0," They have more people out there with PS3s encouraging more people to buy PS3s, and they have"
3567.0,3568.0, a better year.
3568.0,3573.0," But I buy your logic up to 0.3, which is it still comes back to the fact that the third"
3573.0,3576.0," parties won, that I just wanted to spike this year."
3576.0,3580.0," They won't persist in the sales, because these things are fucking expensive to make."
3580.0,3581.0, Right.
3581.0,3582.0," Well, 299 is expensive."
3582.0,3583.0, Yeah.
3583.0,3584.0, 399 is expensive.
3584.0,3585.0, 499 is expensive.
3585.0,3589.0," That's why people were sort of saying, they need to cut an ass cars like is this enough of a price"
3589.0,3590.0, guy now.
3590.0,3596.0," He's, I mean, the thing is, you have to look at cars that run ran SCA for a number of years."
3596.0,3597.0, Who's there for the original PlayStation launch?
3597.0,3599.0, He launched the PlayStation 2.
3599.0,3602.0," You know, you have to think that this guy is non-ideat."
3602.0,3603.0, The understand's of business.
3603.0,3606.0, He can't be looking at sales in any territory.
3606.0,3611.0," Other than day of launch, week of launch, month of launch, and thinking that these numbers are good."
3611.0,3615.0," And that's why I'm saying, like, there has to be something else going on."
3615.0,3617.0, I'm not saying that my source is right.
3617.0,3619.0, I have to run out and run down the numbers.
3619.0,3622.0," But clearly, they know they need to goose this business."
3622.0,3625.0, And that's why I think it's reasonable to think there's something else going on.
3625.0,3629.0, But even 499 is still pretty hot.
3629.0,3630.0, It's still pretty hot.
3630.0,3631.0, It's still pretty hot.
3631.0,3636.0, And I'm not sure that they have the software this year to fully combat that high price.
3636.0,3639.0," I mean, Microsoft has an insane amount of software."
3639.0,3641.0, That was a focus of their press conference.
3641.0,3642.0, It's coming to the Xbox 360.
3642.0,3647.0, And Nintendo's going to be chugging along with their non-games and core games.
3647.0,3651.0," And whatever else they've got, it's going to be a challenge for Sony to get this going."
3651.0,3653.0, And that's like why I think there's something else going on.
3653.0,3655.0, But it was truly bizarre.
3655.0,3656.0, I was stunned.
3656.0,3657.0, It threw off my interview.
3657.0,3660.0," I had to loop back in the end and say, but but but but but so."
3660.0,3662.0," But in you know, in the 20 years I've been playing games."
3662.0,3664.0, I've never seen a console go up in price.
3664.0,3666.0, You can't introduce a new stuff going up in price.
3666.0,3667.0, Right.
3667.0,3668.0, That's the way they're couching it.
3668.0,3669.0," I mean, look right."
3669.0,3672.0," But like I'm saying, in October, when there are no more six to get available,"
3672.0,3677.0, I think it is incomprehensible that you will not at any point this year be able to go to a store
3677.0,3678.0, and buy a PlayStation 3 for 4 now.
3678.0,3680.0," Well, I think it's definitely not incomprehensible."
3680.0,3681.0, I think it will.
3681.0,3683.0, I think it's I think it's every bit believable.
3683.0,3685.0, I think it would be absurdly stupid.
3685.0,3686.0," Well, yeah, and they're not playing double-sad."
3686.0,3689.0, They've already taken away the 499 model once before.
3689.0,3691.0, Why would you think beta on what they've done when you get it?
3691.0,3692.0, Go to 20 gig.
3692.0,3693.0," Oh, launch."
3693.0,3695.0, You're going to be pissed right.
3695.0,3696.0, Right.
3696.0,3698.0, And then they want to do that with a bigger group now.
3698.0,3699.0, I don't know.
3699.0,3701.0, I really think that this is like goose.
3701.0,3704.0," Like we're talking about to get the, but business rolling in, but you don't want to eat."
3704.0,3709.0," Come on, who wants to eat a, a price cut before you're even a year into the cycle"
3709.0,3711.0, on a machine that's costing you a ton to make.
3711.0,3714.0," When you're not selling any hardware, you do not even a billing any."
3714.0,3718.0, But they're going to have to because the more expensive option is to keep it high priced
3718.0,3720.0, and and and die on the vine.
3720.0,3722.0," I mean, that's that's that's the, that's the alternative."
3722.0,3726.0, That's why I think they're counting on the goose to get sales and momentum going for them.
3726.0,3729.0," And then they roll on that through Christmas with the, I think,"
3729.0,3730.0, about crack got it.
3730.0,3732.0," That's not how price, price work."
3732.0,3735.0, I think they're going to continue to incentivize it with like the blue ray promotion.
3735.0,3738.0," If you're looking through in Europe, there's these huge bundles with two games and two"
3738.0,3740.0, six axis controllers because you have it so expensive.
3740.0,3742.0, You're doing the Amazon deal here.
3742.0,3743.0, The Amazon deal here is pretty good deal too.
3743.0,3744.0, I haven't seen nothing.
3744.0,3748.0," Well, one thing that you might think you get a, you get the blue ray remote and you get a blue ray movie"
3748.0,3752.0, and you get the five blue ray choice by mail as well for the like the price.
3752.0,3755.0," Yeah, I think you're going to continue to do this kind of incentive."
3755.0,3757.0," Yeah, it's a great value if you've got that money to spend."
3757.0,3760.0," I mean, but the one thing is if you want to describe even more, I don't know,"
3760.0,3766.0," sinister, conspiratorial motives is, you know, what if this is not only pleasing"
3766.0,3771.0," causes corporate masters, but in a weird way, signaling to consumers look,"
3771.0,3776.0," you better run the stores and get the 60 gigs, you for $499 now because it's only"
3776.0,3778.0, available while supplies last.
3778.0,3783.0," I think that's what you're saying, which is like you get this boom, you get this rush."
3783.0,3787.0," I don't know how sustainable that is, but if people do consume it in that amount,"
3787.0,3791.0, then that starts to get rid of their installed base problem somewhat.
3791.0,3793.0, I think that's probably clear accurate.
3793.0,3795.0," Yeah, well, it's interesting to see out."
3795.0,3796.0, We won't have to wait long.
3796.0,3799.0, It's going to play out in just a couple of months and we'll be for sure.
3799.0,3801.0," Yeah, so there you go."
3801.0,3804.0," I would say, and I mean, this is, I'm going to follow my own advice."
3804.0,3805.0," I'm buying one now, finally."
3805.0,3809.0," And I'm buying one because at $500, it's a hell of a good blue ray player."
3809.0,3810.0, I'm sorry to say that.
3810.0,3811.0," I mean, there are games I'm excited about."
3811.0,3815.0, I will definitely pick up Ninja Gaiden right off the bat and I don't know what else.
3815.0,3816.0, I'm going to pick up.
3816.0,3817.0, I'm looking forward to several games as fall.
3817.0,3821.0," But I mean, but I think this E3, a lot of people I've talked to, this is where,"
3821.0,3824.0," okay, maybe not going to run it by tomorrow, but you know, the lineup here was coming."
3824.0,3825.0, Yeah.
3825.0,3827.0," PSN, PS3, Blue Ray, a lot of people are convinced."
3827.0,3830.0," Yeah, even in my T-T-R-Spot, even games like the little big plan to talk a lot of people,"
3830.0,3832.0, that is like a system cell for a lot of people.
3832.0,3833.0," Oh, God."
3833.0,3834.0, Yeah.
3834.0,3835.0, That echo come trailer.
3835.0,3840.0, I was sitting next to a number of executives from Vendee and they had a strong response
3840.0,3841.0, to echo Chrome.
3841.0,3843.0," You know, I mean, that was just, I don't know."
3843.0,3844.0, I don't know.
3844.0,3846.0," I mean, I love Crush, which it has a lot in common with."
3846.0,3847.0, Yeah.
3847.0,3849.0," But just, I love the aesthetic of that."
3849.0,3850.0, Just the really hot.
3850.0,3851.0," Oh, this is the one you're talking about yesterday."
3851.0,3852.0," Yeah, this is the serious one."
3853.0,3856.0," Yeah, I thought it was really beautiful."
3856.0,3858.0, And I think I've really imaginative.
3858.0,3863.0," Like, Sony seems to be pushing the indie cred end of the spectrum."
3863.0,3864.0, Yeah.
3864.0,3866.0, More than anybody else right now.
3866.0,3869.0," Like, really experimental RT kind of stuff."
3869.0,3872.0," Not, not giving the illusion or pretending to be RT."
3872.0,3875.0," I mean, being genuinely RT in the products."
3875.0,3877.0, They pushed through PSN.
3877.0,3878.0, Yeah.
3878.0,3880.0," On the subject of system cell, is where do you think,"
3881.0,3884.0, Epic's announcement of Unreal Tournament falls into that?
3884.0,3890.0," I think it's pretty monumental, actually, because it plays to a group of people who aren't the PlayStation hardcore."
3890.0,3894.0," Right? They're going after PC and Xbox players, specifically with that exclusivity."
3894.0,3898.0," Yeah, I mean, I'm excited definitely thinking about being able to play on a PS3"
3898.0,3900.0, in front of my television with my 5.1 surround.
3900.0,3904.0, And not really have to worry about whether or not my PC's been upgraded adequately to handle the game.
3904.0,3906.0," I'm kind of over that whole thing, right?"
3906.0,3908.0, And the game looks fantastic.
3908.0,3909.0, Did you check it out?
3909.0,3911.0," I saw it being played, Mark Green was demoing it, and I didn't play it myself."
3911.0,3913.0, Right. I think it looks crazy.
3913.0,3915.0," Yeah, I like UT. I'm definitely going to check it out."
3915.0,3920.0," Yeah, it's like gears of war quality at like much bigger levels."
3920.0,3922.0," You know, it was, I mean, it looked pretty good, like great,"
3922.0,3925.0, like sort of lighting and particle effects and things like that.
3925.0,3927.0," And another part, you know, when they announced that at the press conference,"
3927.0,3933.0," it was the kind of gloss over, but it was a multi-part agreement with Epic and so many for exclusivity."
3933.0,3937.0," And, you know, in EGM, the rumor column, we ran, we heard that one of those games"
3937.0,3939.0, could be a game set in the gears of war universe.
3939.0,3941.0," Not gears of war too, because Microsoft still has that,"
3941.0,3943.0, but I really think that could happen.
3943.0,3946.0, I think that could happen. I think I could see that with the cogs and with the stuff.
3946.0,3948.0," Something next year, that's what I'm saying."
3948.0,3951.0," Well, one thing that Mark did say is that it's not there now,"
3951.0,3954.0," but he thinks, maybe he wants to do it."
3954.0,3957.0," So it's just a matter of what he and the team can do,"
3957.0,3960.0, is they do want to be able to do cross platform play.
3960.0,3964.0," Yep, you know, so PC and PS3 game where he's going head to head."
3964.0,3969.0," I don't think that's a major selling point, but it's a great talking point."
3969.0,3971.0," You know, show or them, right?"
3971.0,3975.0," Yeah, for them and for Sony, and it's a bit of a stick in the item."
3975.0,3980.0, Microsoft that the guys who are making the biggest selling game for your platform
3980.0,3982.0, before Halo 3 ships.
3982.0,3986.0," In years of war, our, you know, all mobbed up now with Sony."
3986.0,3990.0," You know, and it sort of gets people asking, well, why? Why couldn't this happen?"
3990.0,3991.0, And we know why it's not happening.
3991.0,3996.0," It's, it's, it's still the games for Windows live stuff that we know the epic is opposed to."
3996.0,4000.0," And then it's also the fact that, you know, Microsoft and not that appalled garden for the building."
4000.0,4002.0, You're in to Unreal Engine now.
4002.0,4003.0, Which into Unreal Engine.
4003.0,4004.0, Yeah.
4004.0,4006.0," That was, that was UE3, not you T3."
4006.0,4007.0, Yeah.
4007.0,4012.0," You know, I think I still think they're, they're philosophically opposed to how Microsoft's handling games for Windows live."
4012.0,4014.0, But they're partners who want to do it.
4014.0,4015.0," So they're like, you're getting closer."
4015.0,4016.0, So Mark and I were hanging out the other day.
4016.0,4017.0," You know, Guy gets around."
4017.0,4018.0, He talks to all of us.
4018.0,4019.0, And he's kind of crazy.
4019.0,4021.0, But we were thinking about talking about this subject.
4021.0,4028.0," And then the two things that came across, well, the one thing that came across, of course, most strongly is epic has built their company on community involvement."
4028.0,4031.0, And they are never going to sacrifice that.
4031.0,4032.0, They love that.
4032.0,4033.0, And it frustrates them.
4033.0,4038.0, No end having to deal with the tightened architecture of the way live works.
4038.0,4041.0," And for them, Unreal tournament on on PS3, besides,"
4041.0,4043.0," frankly, showed it on PS3 first."
4043.0,4044.0, So it shouldn't have been that big of a surprise.
4044.0,4046.0, It was a no brainer because the network's open.
4046.0,4051.0, And it's no big deal for them to allow people to create levels on their PCs.
4051.0,4057.0," All they have to do is do a quick check and go, okay, can this fit in the 512 megs of RAM that the PS3 has?"
4057.0,4058.0," Okay, it does."
4058.0,4059.0, Good.
4059.0,4060.0, You can play it.
4060.0,4061.0, It's that role.
4061.0,4062.0," Well, that's it."
4062.0,4063.0, That's the whole deal.
4063.0,4064.0," Yeah, I think that announcement also the NC software."
4064.0,4068.0, Very aggressive in their specifically Sony going after Microsoft's way of doing business.
4068.0,4075.0," The good news for Xbox 360 owners is that we did hear, I mean, one thing Mark talked about was how he, you know, he thinks that as"
4075.0,4083.0," as as the live teams work through projects, like one of their projects right now, which is not going to let attention as my live is coming to XP."
4083.0,4090.0," I mean, notice the way like when Cliffie was on there, I love that like, was he's walking off the stage during the gears thing coming to Vista and XP."
4090.0,4095.0," Right. I mean, you like really, I'm afraid that gears was going to be a Vista only game right."
4095.0,4096.0, I think they're not going to do that.
4096.0,4099.0," But there's the thing, why do you guys think Microsoft did that?"
4099.0,4104.0," Because Halo 2, if I'm not mistaken, is that this don't make sense?"
4104.0,4107.0, You can just things you can do to it to make it run on like for the chat.
4107.0,4111.0, Right. So why do you think Microsoft is like a game like that?
4111.0,4113.0," X-field. I mean, Vista only."
4113.0,4120.0," Yeah, but your, your, your, maybe could have convinced people, okay, I'll go get is going to be X-field."
4120.0,4127.0," So what do you, well, just two possibilities. I think it's a concession to to epic or a response to the relatively soft sales of Vista got it."
4127.0,4129.0," I think it's, I think it's primarily."
4129.0,4134.0," And come on, there hasn't been that big of an uptake yet of DX 10 parts. They're very expensive."
4134.0,4140.0," I mean, crisis is going to push that a lot like we were talking about earlier, but I'm going to talk into the lead and he's like, I'm like, what is it going to take to really run these?"
4140.0,4149.0," Like, oh, you know, if you have a quad core with two gigs of memory and a 800 DX 10 card, then you're probably going to take them to myself."
4149.0,4150.0, Yeah.
4150.0,4153.0, I'll see thousands of people have this.
4153.0,4158.0," Well, that's why we should all be savoring our chances to play crisis at these public events."
4158.0,4160.0, Right. How many of us have PCs that can actually run it?
4160.0,4162.0," Dude, I don't have that sitting in my house."
4162.0,4163.0, I don't even have that sitting in my house.
4163.0,4169.0," Anyone, anyone that bought a Mac laptop recently and is savoring the boot camp experience, you're not going to play crisis."
4169.0,4170.0," Well, you've got to happen."
4170.0,4179.0," And you look at the statements that have come out of Critech in the class, sort of implying that PS3 and 360 can't handle, you know, crisis and that crisis won't be coming to the consoles in this form."
4179.0,4184.0," You're saying, like, is he just trying to scare us into spending the same $1,000 right at these PCs?"
4185.0,4190.0, So I think you'll see 360's live environment move to make adjustments.
4190.0,4194.0, Probably next year to allow user-created content to live on marketplaces.
4194.0,4199.0," There's a number of reasons there. I mean, they have the whole XNA thing initiative, which will have a lot of content being generated."
4199.0,4201.0, We took to Shane came about that as well.
4201.0,4208.0," And he was quite dismissive of the Sony, leaving it up to the publisher to police things policy."
4208.0,4212.0," He says that, you know, we took before the show started."
4212.0,4217.0, We were talking with Sean about the show that shows up on the use of mods on PC.
4217.0,4227.0," You know, there are no filters on PC and even Sony who tries to give the illusion of keeping things open does not want, you know,"
4227.0,4232.0," Well, look what happens with the whole thing with, like, you know,"
4232.0,4233.0," It will be L.Mum's stuff, okay."
4233.0,4235.0, The booby cars? Exactly.
4235.0,4252.0," And the Unreal tournament, you know, the, yeah, you were able to post stuff into the system, but the UI for downloading the mods and levels will be the game and the game and that environment is going to be monitored by midway and epic first and by Sony definitely second."
4252.0,4256.0," Like, Sony's not going to let anything objectionable through that box."
4256.0,4259.0," It'll just be, it's just going to be police in a different way."
4259.0,4262.0," But is that, I mean, first of all, game experience may change with online player."
4262.0,4263.0, Yeah.
4263.0,4265.0," But the other thing is, after NESRB, you do the rescue."
4265.0,4267.0, You still answer some questions.
4267.0,4274.0," I think it was on three-speed or somewhere else about, you know, when we saw home for the first time, we saw that you could stream video into it the first thing was."
4274.0,4278.0," It's like, well, porn party and jobs apartment."
4278.0,4279.0," Yeah, baby."
4279.0,4283.0," And, you know, feel pretty much the way the system is architected is."
4283.0,4287.0," It doesn't sound like they're going to be checking IP to make sure, you know, that, you know,"
4287.0,4290.0, Savannah Samson or someone else isn't coming through your thing.
4290.0,4296.0," But it's, it's basically going to be on in the private rooms that you'll be able to sort of view other people's video in public areas."
4296.0,4298.0, You can see it on the other stuff.
4298.0,4303.0," Plus, I think there's, there's going to be, I mean, the moderation, there's going to be flagging people."
4303.0,4307.0," And, you know, if you get sucked into something that you don't want to, there's going to be people."
4307.0,4310.0," I think there's going to be a knock element at home, I think."
4310.0,4314.0," Well, you know, this guy sent me, invited me to be the house and he had porn play in the world."
4314.0,4317.0," Well, ultimately, the thing he is to some degree out of the bottle."
4317.0,4324.0," And there is a desire in the gaming community to have still those kind of garage shop moments, and people want to create that content."
4324.0,4330.0," But, you know, I really don't think, like, Unreal Tournament on PS3 is going to be complete freedom the way."
4330.0,4336.0," If you do it, if you do it with a memory card and, like, you know, either you or your buddy are doing it on PC and you hand it to each other."
4336.0,4340.0," On your hard drive you can have the Pono level or whatever the fuck you want to do,"
4340.0,4348.0, but the stuff that's going through the user-generated content that you go and you go and browse through a year from a lease when the really good models have been doing levels.
4348.0,4354.0," There will be there, but there's not going to be very surprised if the PS3 version had anything offensive."
4354.0,4362.0," So, you know, something else we've talked about with regard to live as a weakness is the lack of dedicated servers for Xbox 360 games."
4362.0,4368.0," And I happen to cross frontline fuels award in the THQ booth, and it's, you know, for one to thirty-two players."
4368.0,4371.0," And I said, oh, this PC version, how many of these is the 360 version going to support?"
4371.0,4373.0," And he said, oh, it's going to support thirty-two players."
4373.0,4375.0," And I asked, well, how are you going to do that in period of period?"
4375.0,4376.0, We're not period of period of period.
4376.0,4378.0," So, there's the answer."
4378.0,4379.0, The answer is finally out there.
4379.0,4383.0," The first game that I know of, it's going to have dedicated servers on Xbox Live will be frontline fuels award."
4383.0,4385.0, And midways hosting those servers.
4385.0,4386.0, Absolutely.
4386.0,4389.0, And they are running them on PC versions that are in TGN.
4390.0,4391.0, It's a TGN.
4391.0,4392.0, TGN.
4392.0,4393.0, TGN.
4393.0,4394.0, TGN.
4394.0,4395.0, TGN.
4395.0,4396.0, TGN.
4396.0,4400.0," There was even at one point in argument, like the marketing department, like, yeah, we just use the regular live service."
4400.0,4401.0," Or, why do we have to pay for this?"
4401.0,4404.0," And the guys are like, because we're making a battlefield tile game."
4404.0,4405.0, It has to have 32 players.
4405.0,4406.0," Well, not that we know that exists."
4406.0,4409.0, What about the perpetual rumor that Halo 3 will have dedicated servers?
4409.0,4414.0," I'd say that the perpetual rumor, there's probably a lot of stock in it, because if they're letting a third party do it."
4414.0,4420.0, How crazy would it be for frontline fuels of war to have dedicated servers and this great online experience?
4420.0,4421.0, And Halo 3B.
4421.0,4423.0," As you and I both said, like, you're paying for this."
4423.0,4425.0," You should at least get, you know, talk quality."
4425.0,4427.0," Well, and you know, I'm not going to stop being that job."
4427.0,4430.0," There were people who were like, say, no, it's only $50 or what's only how much a month."
4430.0,4431.0, And you're crazy.
4431.0,4437.0," I know paying to play games online is got to get back to, like, do it."
4437.0,4438.0, Do it somewhere else.
4438.0,4442.0," There's lots of ways to support those models, but charging me a annual fee to have a live membership."
4442.0,4447.0," Unless you're going to really provide me something other than a game attack and some point,"
4447.0,4449.0, especially when you're paying to be served ads as well.
4449.0,4450.0," Yeah, absolutely."
4450.0,4451.0, All right.
4451.0,4454.0, So there's some other games that I think could be big PS3 system sellers.
4454.0,4460.0, And you and I went on a few people in Sanamana who actually held the control or in play some kill zone.
4460.0,4462.0, I think you're the only person that I know of.
4462.0,4465.0," There's someone else, but that person were a main nameless."
4465.0,4470.0," Because I got to go to this, special showing where the producer played through the entire level of a live."
4470.0,4473.0," That was cool enough, but you actually have to play that level."
4473.0,4475.0, I did get to play that level.
4475.0,4480.0, So it's as intense as it was when we saw it in the theater.
4480.0,4487.0," You know, I mean, it's, you know, there's just a lot going on the challenge I have with these next-generation games."
4487.0,4492.0," The top of the line once is there's like, I'm still dealing with the transition."
4492.0,4497.0, And it's still like sometimes you just feel like there's so much more information than you're used to seeing
4497.0,4501.0, in the old generation games than still like having trouble processing it all.
4501.0,4503.0," So you just like, all those subtle stuff when I was watching that,"
4503.0,4507.0," I mean, I would try to catch little pieces of things swaying and moving around and, you know,"
4507.0,4509.0," when you shot a chair and the physics is flying everywhere,"
4509.0,4511.0," Pete, things of the water falling off."
4511.0,4513.0," And like, you can shoot off individual tiles."
4513.0,4517.0," There's like, after you remember that area where you came into,"
4517.0,4522.0," it was like, like, two balconies separated by an alley and there's like a bit of fire fight across them."
4522.0,4525.0," Well, some of the hellgast are hiding behind these, like,"
4525.0,4528.0," you know, like, what's makeshift metal, shield things."
4528.0,4531.0, You can shoot that away and then take them down behind it.
4531.0,4533.0, So there's all of this stuff going on.
4533.0,4540.0," I mean, it was, but one of the things I focused on in the preview that I wrote was the post-processing effects that they're doing."
4540.0,4546.0," So there's some people who, I mean, obviously the kills on two trailer and got and demo got like really positive response."
4546.0,4548.0, There's some people who were critical of the art style.
4548.0,4553.0," I think there's like, you know, Halo is a very visually inviting game"
4553.0,4557.0," because they use those bright colors, those purples and greens and things that pull you in."
4557.0,4561.0, And this is a very muted color palette and there are a lot of games that have a muted color palette.
4561.0,4564.0, And so kills on gets lumped in with some of those games.
4564.0,4567.0, And I'm sort of paying attention to these games and how they do what they're doing.
4567.0,4573.0," So one of the things they showed me was they showed me that first, like, you know, hit the beach, hit the city square."
4573.0,4575.0," And like, you have that first firefight in the demo."
4575.0,4580.0, They paused it and showed it to me with the post-processing filters turned off.
4580.0,4581.0, Right.
4581.0,4584.0," So just like, what it would look like lit with the lighting in the game."
4584.0,4586.0," And it was actually like, sunnier."
4586.0,4592.0," You know, I'm saying, like, there were these like tones and things that, you're like, that doesn't look like what I saw."
4592.0,4593.0, And they turned it on again.
4593.0,4596.0," And all of a sudden it's like, really oppressive."
4596.0,4599.0," You know, I mean, it is set on the Hellgast home planet."
4599.0,4603.0," It's very mechanized, like, shanty town, very depressing and bounty and death."
4603.0,4606.0," It's evocative, but it does look kind of muted and gray."
4606.0,4607.0," You know, the game is very nice."
4607.0,4609.0, And that's when you realize esterics.
4609.0,4610.0," No, no, hands on."
4610.0,4611.0, I want to know what feels like.
4611.0,4614.0," Well, the reload animations were like one of the best things I saw."
4614.0,4615.0, They were controlling.
4615.0,4617.0," Yeah, it gets out of focus and everything."
4617.0,4618.0," Oh, the motion."
4618.0,4619.0," I mean, it's a lot of the little touches."
4619.0,4620.0," But yeah, like, how does it feel?"
4620.0,4622.0, I saw this as a control post and part of a shooter.
4622.0,4623.0, How does it feel?
4623.0,4624.0, Is it on?
4624.0,4625.0," Yeah, they've got the controls removed."
4625.0,4626.0, It feels good.
4626.0,4627.0, Turning feels good.
4627.0,4631.0, The cover stuff is awesome.
4631.0,4632.0," Well, yeah."
4632.0,4633.0, It's good.
4633.0,4634.0, It's very good.
4634.0,4635.0, There's blind fire.
4635.0,4636.0, Blind fire.
4636.0,4637.0, Yeah.
4637.0,4638.0," So basically what they did is is they, um, the same thing."
4638.0,4644.0," The same guy who coded the cover system, cover and fire system in kills on liberation for"
4644.0,4648.0," PSP, which I always sort of described as like, gears of war top down on your PSP."
4648.0,4650.0," I mean, it kind of like felt good."
4650.0,4653.0, The same guy coded it for kills on two.
4653.0,4659.0," And so what he did was took the model, the 3D model and animated it that way."
4659.0,4663.0," And then once he got that nail down, switch in the first person view and like tweaked and mess"
4663.0,4664.0, with it until work.
4664.0,4667.0," So what you can do is is you go up to a point where you can, you can, you can,"
4667.0,4672.0," grab cover and you hold down, uh, L2, we crouch and hold down L2."
4672.0,4676.0," L2 serves what snaps you in the cover and I can't remember if it was like, you know,"
4676.0,4678.0, hold or toggle.
4678.0,4679.0, I think it was toggle.
4679.0,4683.0," And then you can, you can, if you just fire from the cover position, you'll blind fire."
4683.0,4685.0," You'll see your gun sort of come up over the,"
4685.0,4689.0, burn or whatever you're behind and like shoot at the enemies and kind of spray.
4689.0,4695.0," Um, but if you, if you push forward on the left analogue stick, then it'll pop you up over cover."
4695.0,4698.0," If you push left, it'll push you left around cover."
4698.0,4701.0, Like the rainbow six Vegas system.
4701.0,4703.0," Except it doesn't take you out of, um, uh,"
4703.0,4705.0, it doesn't put you in a third person mode to do it.
4705.0,4706.0, Okay.
4706.0,4712.0," And I think if they design fire fights around that mechanic in part, um,"
4712.0,4717.0," I think that's going to be really compelling because I'm like a more hangback and sort of take guys out,"
4717.0,4719.0, kind of guy rather than run and gun.
4719.0,4722.0," And if they can really nail that and build some stuff around it,"
4722.0,4727.0, then I should think without requiring it because I would want the game to be able to support guys who like to run and gun.
4727.0,4729.0," Like, gays in first person."
4729.0,4735.0, It still feels different from gears.
4735.0,4736.0, It's hard.
4736.0,4738.0, It's hard to put my finger on it.
4738.0,4741.0," You know, and see like what it, it still feels different from gears."
4741.0,4743.0," That's, that's all as much as I can say right now."
4743.0,4750.0," It doesn't feel like gears in first person because the, the roadie run is such an essential part of the gears mechanic and slamming into cover."
4750.0,4756.0," I mean, this is, I mean, Cliffy described gears is sort of like a horizontal platformer,"
4756.0,4759.0," yeah, which is a really true description of the game."
4759.0,4760.0, And this is not that.
4760.0,4763.0," This is something else and,"
4763.0,4770.0, Gorilla still feeling its way in terms of like they still haven't really forcefully imposed themselves on the gaming world.
4770.0,4773.0," So I think it's going to take some time for even us to figure out like,"
4773.0,4774.0, what is it?
4774.0,4775.0, What do these guys do?
4775.0,4777.0, What kind of games they really make?
4777.0,4781.0, I can't really compare it to something else other than maybe some of the
4781.0,4784.0," Medal of Honor games, the original Medal of Honor games."
4784.0,4786.0," When they were saying, yeah, exactly."
4786.0,4788.0," Did you go off, drop the topic?"
4788.0,4791.0," I hear that Medal of Honor is actually good now, but nobody cares."
4791.0,4795.0," Like, you know, they've cried a lot of times, no one pays the attention,"
4795.0,4798.0, but I hear the latest rev is actually doing some really creative stuff.
4798.0,4800.0," Nothing actually, actually work out well for them."
4800.0,4801.0, Did they look nice?
4801.0,4805.0," Do you guys remember, you guys go to the gamers day that you had a few weeks back where they showed it?"
4805.0,4806.0," No, I didn't."
4806.0,4810.0," So there's this, I had the same thing like visual fatigue because it's world more too."
4810.0,4813.0," And you're like, oh, seeing that before."
4813.0,4818.0," There's a level that is the last level in the game, and it's apparently historically based."
4818.0,4826.0," It's some massive German concrete tower that looks like almost bleached white,"
4826.0,4830.0," and there's like guys in the top, and it's like, you know,"
4830.0,4832.0," sniping at you is you're coming down through the air,"
4832.0,4836.0," and if you can land on the roof, you can enter it that way and sort of go down and clear it."
4836.0,4838.0," Or if you land on the ground, you can go up and clear it."
4838.0,4842.0, It looks like nothing you've ever seen before out of World War II.
4842.0,4846.0," And when I was over there, I was talking to those guys and saying, you need to show that."
4846.0,4850.0," And I mean, it's weird because at least snippets of it in the trailer."
4850.0,4854.0," Because that's the one thing you're going to be like, I've never seen that before in World War II."
4854.0,4855.0, I haven't seen that before in the World War II.
4855.0,4856.0, I haven't seen that before in the World War II.
4856.0,4858.0, I haven't seen that before in the World War II.
4858.0,4861.0," The whole parachute in the mechanic is great, but it's World War II."
4861.0,4863.0, You still feel like the fatigue.
4863.0,4866.0, But I think the same problem is facing brothers and arms.
4866.0,4870.0," The games both look really good, but there's so many other things that are new and fresh that they just kind of get overlaid."
4870.0,4872.0," Oh, dude, brothers and arms is amazing."
4872.0,4875.0," Yeah, but like on, but are you seeing it on lots of best lists?"
4875.0,4876.0," No, no one, you know, it's great game."
4876.0,4878.0, It would definitely be on my best list.
4878.0,4879.0, It would definitely be on my best list.
4879.0,4880.0, It would definitely be on my best list.
4880.0,4881.0, Exactly.
4881.0,4885.0," Yeah, because those guys at Gearbox Randy, you know, they're really great team."
4885.0,4895.0," Well, I think what I like what they did about this version of that game is that they focused a lot on the through the gun experience of shooting, which wasn't as high a priority before."
4895.0,4904.0," And really, it's as much a case of like the technology has come along far enough that they can now really incorporate a good shooter game with the good tactical action part of the game."
4904.0,4905.0, You need to take that.
4905.0,4911.0, You take the way that they're able to bust up the environment and use cover and use tactics.
4911.0,4923.0," And you've got a game that is really, really engrossing and really gets you in the in the like you feel like you're in the thick of the shit in that game really through the extent of you feel like you're right there and these guys are around you."
4923.0,4925.0," And if you're not making the right choices, they are dying."
4925.0,4926.0," Well, it's funny."
4926.0,4930.0," We kind of say way to way from Killzone, but you know, we're talking about these games that are getting overlooked to the three that are really good games."
4930.0,4932.0, And that's kind of how I felt when I was walking around the bargaret hangar.
4932.0,4939.0," I kept seeing games that used to be games that would go on covers and people cared about like mercenaries to or, you know, or these people are talking about."
4939.0,4942.0, Like nobody's talking about them because there's so many great games here.
4942.0,4944.0," Dude, these combat six can't buy a word."
4944.0,4945.0, Right.
4945.0,4947.0," And Sean, you were talking about burnout."
4947.0,4949.0, burnout's in on one pod.
4949.0,4954.0, There's one copy of burnout paradise here and it's it's stunning.
4954.0,4956.0," I mean, like for me, you know, for me, like we personally."
4956.0,4957.0, We switched about yesterday.
4957.0,4958.0," Yeah, we switched about yesterday."
4958.0,4961.0," I mean, it's probably my personal game in the show."
4961.0,4964.0," You know, like for the game that I'm really looking forward to putting on a home."
4964.0,4965.0, I think it's fantastic.
4965.0,4973.0," I really question some of the decisions that EA made about which games to put in Barker hangar and which ones to put in in America because I mean,"
4973.0,4978.0," I got the family version, the family thing of on on on way of Madden."
4978.0,4980.0, They had the connoisseur game that was connoisseur game.
4980.0,4983.0, That's the bookie rock band.
4983.0,4988.0," Yeah, you could see us because the first thing you saw when you went in and from that mistake and was their casual games."
4988.0,4989.0, Right.
4989.0,4992.0," Yeah, so clearly EA's caught religion on casual games."
4992.0,4995.0, But the thing is at least they should have had sweets.
4995.0,5006.0," At the, they should have had sweets at the, at the America where they had their, you know, their hall where Alex could have been with, with burnout and everyone got saved in it."
5006.0,5011.0," Particularly anyone that's picked it up and played it has been like, oh my God, they've really moved it out on this thing."
5011.0,5012.0, It's fantastic.
5012.0,5013.0," Well, look at the rock band."
5013.0,5014.0, It's second.
5014.0,5021.0," But I want to mention why I think is EA's biggest misstep, which was not showing the Spielberg Next-Gen project, which is known as Elemental."
5021.0,5024.0," Elemental, but a pure Elemental, that's what it's codename."
5024.0,5025.0, Elemental.
5025.0,5026.0, Elemental.
5026.0,5027.0, Elemental.
5027.0,5029.0, There's a screenshot of it in Newsweek.
5029.0,5033.0," And, you know, it's the game that's been described as eco meets North by Northwest."
5033.0,5039.0," And it's a story of like, you're a regular guy and you could just, this alien girl from outer space comes and you're on the run through America."
5039.0,5041.0, You're being pursued by somebody.
5041.0,5045.0," And the screenshot it shows just the girl, just like holding a puppy and she's at it like the rundown hotel."
5045.0,5047.0," And it looks, it looks really interesting and evocative."
5047.0,5050.0, And you hear about this game and you talk to people working on it and it sounds really amazing.
5050.0,5055.0," And you know, the eco thing plays into the game journalist, you know, mentality completely."
5055.0,5058.0, I think they could have possibly stolen three had they showed it in the way.
5058.0,5059.0, This is what they said.
5059.0,5060.0, The kids show it.
5060.0,5066.0," EA pays it in the first stage of, it's in the, they sort of said, explain to me when I went to visit them, that there's two stages of reproduction."
5066.0,5068.0, And I think they're just wrapping the first stage.
5068.0,5071.0," So it's not, but like, these are just like a teaser to get us all excited."
5071.0,5072.0, I think they could have done something.
5072.0,5076.0," There's a concept art teaser that they have in house, but they don't want to show that."
5076.0,5077.0, They know you want gameplay.
5078.0,5081.0, EA pays through in the next dice game as well. It's called like mirror edge.
5081.0,5082.0, Yes.
5082.0,5083.0, Yes.
5083.0,5084.0, Is somebody's called mirror something?
5084.0,5085.0, Mirrors edge.
5085.0,5086.0, Mirror's edge.
5086.0,5087.0, Yeah.
5087.0,5090.0," Which is like, it's like got lots of like free running type mechanics, but in first person."
5090.0,5094.0," And it's like a really different, different take on on being able to do an action game in first person."
5094.0,5096.0, There's not necessarily a good place to see it.
5096.0,5097.0, Then show that either.
5097.0,5098.0, No.
5098.0,5099.0, Okay.
5099.0,5100.0, You do it.
5100.0,5101.0, It's really quick.
5101.0,5102.0, I feel like you've seen it.
5102.0,5103.0," No, I haven't had to see it."
5103.0,5105.0," Which is, but again, it's like it's an unusual choice."
5105.0,5107.0," So the people that have seen it have been like, oh my god, you got it."
5107.0,5118.0," You know, this game sounds like such an amazing and like different take on taking a look and feel of a game that you, that is, it is very expected, but throwing a completely different game."
5118.0,5119.0, Play mechanic at it.
5119.0,5120.0, You know.
5120.0,5122.0," So you, we were talking about the forgotten games of E3."
5122.0,5127.0," I mean, this is kind of building on something I was thinking as far as like, can you damn ring or I?"
5127.0,5128.0, I did it off.
5128.0,5129.0, If I have no idea what I'm doing.
5129.0,5131.0," I just, I turned it to silent a minute ago."
5132.0,5142.0," The whole thought of why I thought that metal of honor not being on people's radar anymore, but it would be a good thing for them because it gives them the opportunity to do what they did originally, which is surprise you."
5142.0,5144.0," And then, you know, if they have the tower thing, that's really cool."
5144.0,5151.0," And maybe some of these other games, maybe being forgotten right now, it will work out for the ones that are potential triple-wise because they'll be able to surprise you."
5151.0,5155.0," But that doesn't really match what they want to do marketing wise, because you're making a triple-a-time."
5155.0,5157.0, You want to have the word out that you want to have people buying it.
5158.0,5160.0," It puts them in a tough situation, right?"
5160.0,5165.0," Well, at least they are focusing on rock band, which I think a lot of people might not make it for a game of the show."
5165.0,5167.0," You know, I might?"
5167.0,5169.0," Yeah, I was really ready on it."
5169.0,5174.0," And there was a guy who, I mean, he wasn't a professional drummer."
5174.0,5176.0, He was a guy who got it out.
5176.0,5178.0, He's out of the way.
5178.0,5180.0, He plays a drum.
5180.0,5181.0, He's been playing drums for 15 years.
5181.0,5182.0, He was a journalist.
5182.0,5184.0," I'm not sure where he was from, but he sat down."
5184.0,5185.0, They were playing the divana song.
5185.0,5186.0," And on hard, right?"
5186.0,5187.0, And he was playing on hard.
5187.0,5191.0, We've always heard that on hard playing the drums in rock band is like really playing the drums.
5191.0,5195.0," Well, this guy was banging the shit out of that drum kit."
5195.0,5197.0," Like, like a real drummer."
5197.0,5198.0, It wasn't like watching a game.
5198.0,5200.0, I tried to try and to hit the drums.
5200.0,5202.0, He was playing the drums.
5202.0,5204.0, And the thing wasn't wobbling.
5204.0,5205.0, It wasn't shaking.
5205.0,5208.0, It was taking this incredible beating that he was giving.
5208.0,5210.0, You said he even like stopped watching the game.
5210.0,5211.0," Yeah, he stopped watching the game."
5211.0,5213.0, And he was just playing the drums.
5213.0,5217.0," It's like, when you watch someone play a karaoke and they know the song off by"
5217.0,5219.0," Ha Ha on the dist, and they're just singing along with it."
5219.0,5221.0, This guy was playing the drums along with it.
5221.0,5223.0," Well, there's been a lot of guitar here with three verses rock band."
5223.0,5226.0," And actually, EGM's Michael Dhanhoe made a really great hit."
5226.0,5228.0," He's like, yeah, this is how he's had it."
5228.0,5232.0," He's like, guitar here with three is mega death to rock band's Metallica."
5232.0,5233.0, Yeah.
5233.0,5236.0," Oh, that's great."
5236.0,5241.0," It's hard to make the, it's hard to argue against that because rock band has unleashed so much"
5241.0,5244.0," and they have so much like both, they have drums."
5244.0,5245.0, They have singing.
5245.0,5246.0, They have this whole song.
5246.0,5248.0," You might be, it's a killee's heel though."
5248.0,5249.0, Really?
5249.0,5251.0, Because I think everyone wants to play drum.
5251.0,5253.0, When the drums are the most expensive peripherals.
5253.0,5254.0, Yeah.
5254.0,5256.0," But I think you see, like, all I've heard by like, you know, people say,"
5256.0,5257.0," obviously in rock band, all I saw."
5257.0,5259.0," So I mean, someone saw some, have you seen the drum kit?"
5259.0,5260.0, Have you seen anyone playing the drum?
5260.0,5262.0," And like, everyone is, is fixated on the drum."
5262.0,5264.0, No one cares about the karaoke part.
5264.0,5265.0," Well, it'll be popular."
5265.0,5266.0," Well, it's funny."
5266.0,5267.0," Like, Brian was like, why did they even put them?"
5267.0,5268.0," Well, why not?"
5268.0,5269.0," You know, karaoke revolution is a popular franchise."
5269.0,5270.0, Yeah.
5270.0,5271.0," I mean, I think that's why they've got to include more content."
5271.0,5272.0, But why do you upset?
5272.0,5273.0, It's about that.
5273.0,5274.0, It's about that.
5274.0,5275.0, Yeah.
5275.0,5276.0, Yeah.
5276.0,5277.0," It's like, you have to have this thing."
5277.0,5278.0," I mean, you don't have to."
5278.0,5279.0, And you have to have this.
5279.0,5280.0, And you have to have this.
5280.0,5281.0, And you have to have this.
5281.0,5282.0, And you have to have this.
5282.0,5284.0, Don't underestimate guitar hero 3 though.
5284.0,5287.0," I mean, I think that it's, we very quick to say, oh, rock man's very pretty."
5287.0,5288.0, It looks cool.
5288.0,5290.0," And then just say, oh, goodbye to guitar hero 3."
5290.0,5291.0, I played guitar hero 3.
5291.0,5292.0," Of course, it's solid."
5292.0,5293.0," And of course, it's going to, I would sell rock band."
5293.0,5294.0, I guarantee that.
5294.0,5295.0," I mean, we've made this argument before logically."
5295.0,5299.0," There's a lot of power to the guitar hero brand, but I think there's an emotional thing"
5299.0,5302.0," with rock band that once you've seen it, the best possible thing."
5302.0,5306.0, EA needs to get rock band in front of as many people as possible.
5306.0,5308.0, They need to be going on.
5308.0,5312.0," You know, I think they should have, I think the release date center funny place because what"
5312.0,5317.0, they should have done is they should have had a rock band promo truck on every big fucking
5317.0,5319.0," summer tour this year, like the walls."
5319.0,5323.0, There's a lot of fun and everything with people like and have the bands come out.
5323.0,5326.0, And have the bands come out and do stuff and then have people go up there and do stuff.
5326.0,5328.0, And they'll have rock band and all these bands.
5328.0,5329.0, It's to be getting a huge franchise.
5329.0,5330.0, Yeah.
5330.0,5332.0, I don't think it's the last we've seen of rock band.
5332.0,5337.0," If this had been last year's E3 where you had like, you know, the two halls and it was convention"
5337.0,5339.0," center whatnot, the old E3."
5339.0,5343.0," If this had been there, you know, we walked right into South Hall in the first thing you see as EA's"
5343.0,5344.0, booth.
5344.0,5347.0," I mean, it had it set up in the middle there and had people rock out what not."
5347.0,5350.0," It would have been to this year's E3, what the Wii was to last year."
5350.0,5355.0, And there would have been no way that you could have left E3 talking about guitar here
5355.0,5357.0, of three instead of rock band.
5357.0,5358.0, You know what I was saying?
5358.0,5362.0," It's like just seeing it, it's the fantasy fulfilled."
5362.0,5363.0, Yeah.
5363.0,5365.0," You won't talk about it instead, but guitar here of three does have a lot going for it."
5365.0,5367.0," Like first of all, the guitar battles are a lot of fun."
5367.0,5371.0, And the fact that slash went into the studio and recorded all original material for
5371.0,5377.0," his battle, like when you battle slash, you're actually playing a two-sided song or two-sided"
5377.0,5382.0, guitar jam that slash went into a studio and recorded specifically for this game with like him
5382.0,5384.0, dueling himself on guitar and that's what you're playing.
5384.0,5386.0," And that is really, really cool."
5386.0,5389.0," And the way the mechanic works of, you know, using your star power button, to be coming"
5389.0,5393.0," star power, being a tack that you throw at the other person's fretboard, is really cool."
5393.0,5397.0, And the concerns about never-soff taking the game and whether or not it would work or they
5397.0,5400.0," could make a game, I can tell you, I can just lay it to rest right now."
5400.0,5405.0, I was actually surprised because in prior years when we've seen early builds of guitar hero
5405.0,5409.0, it was hard to get a feel for how well they would play because they typically had some
5409.0,5412.0," frame rate issues, they hadn't come up to speed, they were sink, they would change their"
5412.0,5416.0, note tracking around the demo that they had here for a guitar hero
5416.0,5419.0," three was fully realized, it had great sound."
5419.0,5421.0," They changed their room, I mean like tweaking it."
5421.0,5422.0," I mean, what is that thing?"
5422.0,5424.0," I mean, I think that's a good time playing."
5424.0,5428.0," You're talking about this, but didn't a great job emulating a very successful franchise."
5428.0,5433.0," Meanwhile, and the note tracking is dude, I mean, while the people who made this game,"
5433.0,5437.0," they made the real evolution, and that's rock band."
5437.0,5438.0," And the problem, the problem, the problem."
5438.0,5439.0, Or instruments makes it better.
5439.0,5445.0," Well, here's the one thing that's interesting is that never-soff sort of took it and made it more of a gamer game."
5445.0,5447.0," It's a game now, yeah."
5447.0,5449.0," Yeah, you know, it's one of the things that is just being a rock star."
5449.0,5453.0," Yeah, and if you look at the elements, like some of the things they put in like being able to"
5453.0,5456.0," talk your opponent, that stuff that harmonics was doing in amplitude, right?"
5456.0,5459.0," You know, so it's interesting to see sort of see that stuff, that looks familiar."
5459.0,5462.0," I don't get into rip off kind of way, I mean, I really like what never-soff's done with it."
5462.0,5468.0," And I think that stuff's interesting, but the danger in what activated has to look out for is"
5468.0,5474.0," Guitar Hero became a hit because there were some core gamers who latched onto it and told their friends,"
5474.0,5477.0," he brought their friends onto it and played it, and sort of built up steadily through that."
5477.0,5479.0," You know, it was like the game of the people."
5479.0,5484.0, I think the same influencers that made Guitar Hero a hit are gonna move over.
5484.0,5490.0," The taste they're making, the taste they're making, and it doesn't mean because playing guitar is still fun."
5490.0,5492.0, It doesn't mean that people won't buy both.
5492.0,5498.0," But I think the thing is it's like, it's gonna be like the Wii, it's like when you have the opportunity to either just go"
5498.0,5501.0," Guitar, right? You know, head to head and guitar hero."
5501.0,5502.0, Or guitar bass.
5502.0,5503.0, Guitar bass.
5503.0,5508.0," Yeah, it's all for to break out the whole thing and everyone's collaborating on the same thing."
5508.0,5516.0," I just, to me, that's more of the fantasy that it's like Guitar Hero is the game, rock bands of fantasy."
5516.0,5521.0," Which is cool, and I'm not saying that I don't like rock band better for a number of reasons."
5521.0,5523.0, Like predominant jazz songs.
5523.0,5524.0," And then if it's called on music, right?"
5524.0,5525.0, None of us think Guitar Hero 3 is bad.
5525.0,5529.0," But I want to make sure and get out there and say, you know, don't take a dumb punk guitar hero 3 too early"
5529.0,5532.0, because my biggest concerns were easily addressed by played it.
5532.0,5536.0," Besides, they have like over 50% of their songs are now Master Tracks."
5536.0,5542.0, They got living color into the studio to actually do a cult of personality over again with Vernon Reed
5542.0,5544.0," Like, I am going to make the guitar so little harder."
5544.0,5547.0, And it is totally crazy.
5547.0,5549.0, And I would say the note tracking.
5549.0,5555.0, You can tell that someone different than harmonics did it because they've done things that harmonics didn't do.
5555.0,5557.0, And it for better for worse.
5557.0,5564.0," Like part of the deal is they went to one of the big guitar hero sites and they got some of those guys who are like the very, very, you know, Jedi Master Guitar players"
5564.0,5566.0, to help them work on note tracking.
5566.0,5571.0," And it feels, there are a couple passages where like, those things it really felt more like playing guitar because they were doing different."
5571.0,5576.0," You know, different moves on the fretboard that I hadn't done before and I play a log guitar hero."
5576.0,5581.0, Do you think guitars and both games have the same buttons in the same place?
5581.0,5582.0, Yes and no.
5582.0,5586.0, Because it's going to really suck if you think it's the same guitar doesn't work in both games.
5586.0,5593.0," I know you're going to want to buy this radicals to put, but then you stand the guitar hero guitar works with rock band."
5593.0,5595.0, Whether for the colors in the same place.
5595.0,5602.0," Yes, however, there are additional buttons on the guitar hero guitar that are the bass and neck."
5602.0,5605.0, On the rock band guitar.
5605.0,5606.0, For additional.
5606.0,5611.0," So I think that way you can do in these crazy souls, you can do these hammerons and hammer-offs in different ways."
5611.0,5613.0, I'm not sure if that's the exact same thing.
5613.0,5617.0, So you could buy the rock band guitar and play that on both.
5617.0,5621.0, But the guitar hero guitar is not going to deliver on rock band.
5621.0,5623.0," Not completely, not completely."
5623.0,5624.0, Not completely.
5625.0,5626.0, I think it's cool.
5626.0,5629.0, Obviously the music genre is all just completely erupted.
5629.0,5633.0, It's been on that teeter toter for a long time of karaoke revolutions and stuff.
5633.0,5634.0, But now it's like...
5634.0,5635.0, It's hard freaks.
5635.0,5637.0, Why is it so nice to be sitting this loud?
5637.0,5638.0, They're really good.
5638.0,5639.0, They're really good.
5639.0,5640.0, They're really good.
5640.0,5641.0, They're really good.
5641.0,5642.0, They're really good.
5642.0,5643.0, They're really good.
5643.0,5647.0, I also think Nintendo is dropping the ball because they could have had some sort of music game.
5647.0,5649.0, We saw you that early in the simple orchestra thing last year.
5649.0,5650.0," Yeah, wait, where's that?"
5650.0,5652.0," Yeah, I think it's a mystery opportunity."
5652.0,5654.0, I think how broad and masked their feel is.
5654.0,5656.0, The weak guitar for guitar hero 3 is kind of funny.
5656.0,5661.0," It has like a, you flip the guitar over and there's a door on the back of the guitar that you open and drop the weed mode."
5661.0,5663.0, I don't understand why you have to do that.
5663.0,5666.0, Why isn't it just a wireless guitar?
5666.0,5667.0, Say it will say his money.
5667.0,5669.0, It's a cheap adivoy.
5669.0,5670.0, Yeah.
5670.0,5672.0, They use all the functionality of this book.
5672.0,5674.0, And you might build a use it for the tilt functionality and some other things.
5674.0,5676.0, I was thinking ZZ Top spins.
5676.0,5678.0, Yeah.
5678.0,5679.0, Alright.
5679.0,5681.0," Hey, I like that."
5682.0,5689.0," One more game I want to make sure we get to before we start doing it talking about, you know, like wrap up and games of the show and all that kind of stuff is fall out 3."
5689.0,5691.0, And you went and saw it.
5691.0,5695.0," And apparently they have a beautiful theater complete with, you know, the theatrical chairs and everything."
5695.0,5696.0," It was just the trial of that, right?"
5696.0,5697.0, No.
5697.0,5702.0," No, it was, it was, it was on, it was showing aspects of like, you know, fairly early on the game and whatnot."
5702.0,5705.0, Now I have to confess the complete disclosure.
5705.0,5707.0, I did fall asleep.
5708.0,5709.0, Was it warm and dark?
5709.0,5714.0, And you're not the first journalist that told me that in that theater in those chairs which are pretty very comfortable that you would at sleep.
5714.0,5715.0, Let me make it clear.
5715.0,5720.0, This is in no way casting dispersions against Bethesda or their fantastic game.
5720.0,5725.0, And it was one of those kind of falling asleep where I didn't even know I'd fall asleep until I woke up.
5725.0,5728.0," You know, so it wasn't like I caught myself. Oh, I'm falling asleep."
5728.0,5731.0, What I saw looked phenomenal.
5731.0,5736.0," I mean, that game just, you know, the art direction, the, the, the whole like real time."
5736.0,5743.0," Not real time sort of like, the targeting system like turn based sort of combat."
5743.0,5746.0, I'm so bummed that I didn't get over to say it was one of those things.
5746.0,5749.0," I'm really looking forward to saying, well, just do some fantastic stuff."
5749.0,5754.0," And the thing is it's like, I never got into oblivion in part because I'm not really a sword and sorcery kind of guy."
5754.0,5762.0," Men and tights isn't my thing, but fall out might be my first game of like, you know, my first like, you know, Bethesda, you know, fall on our P.G. game."
5762.0,5766.0," I don't want to get into it. And it's just, they're just doing very cool stuff."
5766.0,5771.0," The only thing I wish they had changed and like, I know we've got some mass effect fans among you."
5771.0,5777.0, So you'll probably feel the same way is the conversations still have the person looking dead on at you.
5777.0,5783.0, And this is the love that weird creepy oblivion face where the symmetrical face is.
5783.0,5786.0," Yeah, yeah, some, some."
5786.0,5790.0, It's just mass effect is just so powerful the way they're doing those cutscenes.
5790.0,5797.0," And I don't understand why, but people will be glad to know anything has been reported that they support, you know, full on 3D, like a third person perspective."
5797.0,5801.0, So you can pull the camera back. I think you even adjust how far back you send it.
5801.0,5805.0, So you could almost play it gears of war slash RE4 style.
5805.0,5806.0," I mean, it's a new development team."
5806.0,5812.0, Do they accurately capture that weird mix of like post-apocalyptic despair and weird humor that evolved to the floor?
5812.0,5815.0," Yes, yes. I mean, it's, it's there."
5815.0,5820.0," They're doing it. Now I'm not a long time father fan and I'm sure those guys are, you know, burning, you know,"
5820.0,5824.0," the fx didn't effigy somewhere, but what I saw is going to be strong."
5824.0,5826.0, I think that fx is going to have another huge hit on there.
5826.0,5830.0, I think a long time follow-up fans were already burned by the really shitty PS2 and Xbox follow games.
5830.0,5832.0, This should be returned to form. Absolutely.
5832.0,5833.0, Absolutely.
5833.0,5838.0," Well, it's a much different style though. I mean, first person, first person or third person, the engine that was built,"
5838.0,5844.0," that a blivit was built on, does not going to give you the same sort of mix of tactical combat and command that fall out,"
5844.0,5849.0," maybe when you were actually in the battle. But if they get the atmosphere right, I think that would go along."
5849.0,5855.0," They own the atmosphere, but the tactical stuff and unfortunately that was starting fall asleep is, you know,"
5855.0,5859.0, you can target individual parts of the bodies and things like that.
5859.0,5864.0," So it just, it just has a nice feeling, it just feels very integrated, very seamless."
5864.0,5869.0," I think people are going to be, I would say even to the fall out haters or the fall three haters,"
5869.0,5871.0," who are fall out fans, give it a chance."
5871.0,5874.0," You know, pay attention to it because I think the game is going to be pretty special."
5874.0,5875.0, That's cool.
5875.0,5879.0, And the next couple of weeks we're going to be hearing a lot of wrap-ups on all this stuff.
5879.0,5883.0," So I guess as we pull our show here to the finish line,"
5883.0,5887.0," let's do a little wrap-up kind of, you want to do a dual thing right now."
5887.0,5892.0," Yeah, I want to do what you think is going to be, you know, the game of the show,"
5892.0,5895.0," just from, you know, just being as observers of the industry,"
5895.0,5896.0, what do you think everyone's going to alarm on to.
5896.0,5902.0," And then what I want to hear from each of you is, is what is the game that really speaks"
5902.0,5905.0," about you individually, like the thing that you're really looking for, what are getting home?"
5905.0,5910.0," It could be the same thing, but I think there are games that you can appreciate on a sort of broader level and to say,"
5910.0,5913.0," okay, well, that's probably the most powerful thing here, like,"
5913.0,5916.0," like rock band or whatever, against the start."
5916.0,5918.0, Can you get our shame?
5918.0,5922.0," I'll start. Okay, so if I'm going to say the game of show in terms of overall importance"
5922.0,5926.0," and like coming out of E3 with what the real takeaway is, I almost want to say we health."
5926.0,5928.0," And I played it, I was a huge skeptic."
5928.0,5932.0," I mean, like Nintendo, it was their big focus then the press conference and it kind of struck us out."
5932.0,5934.0," We fit, we fit, I'm sorry."
5934.0,5935.0, We can't help it.
5935.0,5940.0," I hate the name we fit, like it should be fitness because it fit, fit is not a noun."
5940.0,5946.0," Anyway, it was Nintendo's big focus and it kind of went over like a lead balloon with enthusiasm gamers and like,"
5946.0,5947.0, where's my kid at Chris?
5947.0,5953.0," But after I actually played it, I found it weirdly engaging and addictive and I do want to play it again."
5953.0,5957.0, And I think it's perfectly in line with what Nintendo is doing and that's doing.
5957.0,5962.0," It's totally, it's so successful in reaching other consumers and I was talking to someone at the party last night."
5962.0,5967.0," They said, like, this is, you know, like Sony had that Nike game, the I-Toy Nike,"
5967.0,5969.0," I mean, I'm a favorite, it's called kinetic kinetic energy."
5969.0,5971.0," Oh, and here we go, and like nobody cared."
5971.0,5972.0, Right.
5972.0,5975.0," And Microsoft had that game, they didn't publish it, but it was on Xbox, like, for what it was called."
5975.0,5976.0, Right.
5976.0,5978.0," They did a terrific thing, that kind of creepy."
5978.0,5979.0, Right.
5979.0,5984.0," And Nintendo even had a dance aerobics game for their power pad and yes, some 15 plus years ago."
5984.0,5989.0," But finally, you know, like the industry and like soccer moms, now the moms have caught up with games and I think that,"
5989.0,5993.0," you know, as much as we, you know, we always say, oh, you know, we use all for soccer moms,"
5993.0,5995.0, but it really is and this is an important turning point.
5995.0,6001.0," So it's the right time to do it because the whole world is caught up in the whole way, like reality,"
6001.0,6002.0," distortion, feel it."
6002.0,6005.0, Anything associated with it seems to get more attention.
6005.0,6009.0," And I am a big resports fan, and while playing it, it did feel like resports too in a lot of ways."
6009.0,6014.0," Wasn't a lot of what you're talking about, though, while you thought that DS would be so big at the show and DS, what happened?"
6014.0,6018.0," Well, they didn't show anything, and like some of the exciting games like Professor Layton weren't even here, you know,"
6018.0,6023.0," so, but there were some interesting third party DS games here that you wouldn't expect to keep a go up and say, oh,"
6023.0,6025.0, the Daffy Duck games actually really good.
6025.0,6026.0, That's not something you hear.
6026.0,6027.0, You don't get that out of the day.
6027.0,6028.0, Whatever.
6028.0,6034.0," Dude, the Daffy Duck game, I mean, it was just, I, when I first saw it, I was trying to figure out, well, what's the guts?"
6034.0,6038.0," Like, what if you strip away the stuff that's on top, the stuff that really makes it awesome?"
6038.0,6039.0, Yeah.
6039.0,6040.0, What is it?
6040.0,6044.0," It's kind of Nintendo's, in the sense that it's sort of like direct manipulation of a character, though, it's,"
6044.0,6050.0," you don't have as much leeway with their relationship, but just the idea that Daffy is self aware,"
6050.0,6054.0," he knows he's in a video game, you can erase his body, draw in a new body,"
6054.0,6057.0," your antagonizing him, and what post-multhing Daffy Duck."
6057.0,6059.0, Did you try closing the Pringle-Wiensteen mode?
6059.0,6060.0, Genius.
6060.0,6062.0, They had to get special permission from Nintendo to do that.
6062.0,6063.0, Why do you explain it?
6063.0,6064.0, Why are you explain it?
6064.0,6065.0, Okay.
6065.0,6071.0, So what you do is is that there's this part where Daffy is trying to capture someone in the dark.
6071.0,6073.0, And he needs you to help him do it.
6073.0,6077.0," And so what you have to do is close the lid and you're listening to it on your phones or through the speakers,"
6077.0,6081.0," and then he says to the left, and you hit the left button, and the right, and it's just sort of like this thing,"
6081.0,6083.0, but you're playing with the lid closed.
6083.0,6084.0, Whoa.
6084.0,6088.0," But up, and the reason Nintendo has to give him special differentiation is because when you close it,"
6088.0,6089.0, it's supposed to go to sleep mode.
6089.0,6094.0," And so for this thing, and it's just honestly like, people need to pay attention to that."
6094.0,6095.0, You can use your great advantage.
6095.0,6097.0," Yes, it's super clear outside the box."
6097.0,6098.0, It's very outside the box.
6098.0,6103.0," The animations are sick on the Wii screen, like the Wii screen, everything I'm the DS screen."
6103.0,6107.0," Sorry, what they've done, it just looks like it's publishing it."
6107.0,6110.0," So worm-rothers is publishing it, and then it's way forward."
6110.0,6112.0, It's the developer.
6112.0,6113.0, So you're also making control.
6113.0,6114.0, Is it this here?
6114.0,6115.0, Yes.
6115.0,6116.0, Yes.
6116.0,6122.0," The other one, and I know some of your listeners will be both skeptical and weirdly fascinated."
6122.0,6124.0," Hannah Montana, DS."
6124.0,6125.0, Yeah.
6125.0,6126.0, Part two.
6126.0,6127.0, Part two.
6127.0,6128.0, Yeah.
6128.0,6129.0, That's great.
6129.0,6130.0, He's some to something.
6130.0,6132.0, It's definitely fucking huge.
6132.0,6134.0, That game is no joke.
6134.0,6135.0, That game is no joke.
6135.0,6136.0," So, she's no joke."
6136.0,6137.0, She's huge.
6137.0,6138.0, She's so Kelly Clarkson.
6138.0,6139.0, Yeah.
6139.0,6143.0," So let's explain to the people we're listening because they're probably thinking right now that we're like,"
6143.0,6144.0, zero.
6144.0,6145.0, Get some of the real-
6145.0,6146.0, That's a script.
6146.0,6150.0, What it is is a guitar game for the DS.
6150.0,6156.0," So, in back before GDC, I got like a little exclusive from Ubisoft about the guitar jam."
6156.0,6157.0, Jam session.
6157.0,6158.0, Jam session.
6158.0,6160.0, The Ubisoft did that game.
6160.0,6162.0, I'm in partner with their Japanese development team.
6162.0,6167.0," It's a single string that goes across the screen, and you pick that."
6167.0,6172.96, Which means that you have to do all these weird contortions with the D-pad and the shoulder buttons in order to get the different
6172.96,6173.96, chords.
6173.96,6175.96," It's very cool, very powerful, and it's only acoustic."
6175.96,6179.96," Hannah Montana, Jam sessions, I'm going to get this wrong because I don't really play guitar,"
6179.96,6181.96, but like however many strings you have on a guitar.
6181.96,6182.96, Six.
6182.96,6183.96, Six.
6183.96,6184.96, There you go.
6184.96,6185.96, Six string.
6185.96,6186.96, So it's got all six strings.
6186.96,6187.96, You can pluck them individually.
6187.96,6188.96, You can strum across the whole set.
6188.96,6191.96," You can do lead guitar, bass guitar, rhythm, guitar, and drum."
6191.96,6193.96, I can't believe I want to play a Hannah Montana game.
6193.96,6194.96, You can record.
6194.96,6199.96," You can record each track individually, and then play them back together."
6200.96,6207.96," It's actually a very complex experience that because it's got the Hannah Montana D-d loss over it,"
6207.96,6209.96, it's going to go way broader than it would.
6209.96,6213.96, If they released it as rock band beat.
6213.96,6214.96, Rock band beat.
6214.96,6216.96," Well, I actually know that because they would have the rock band brand."
6216.96,6220.96," But if it was just like some kind of music game, it would be like a curio, and it would be like,"
6220.96,6223.96," this is like a really clever use of de-est technology, and no one would buy it."
6223.96,6225.96, But it's Hannah Montana.
6225.96,6229.96," So everyone at the bottom of the Hannah Montana won, which is like 4 million people else."
6229.96,6232.96, I'm saying I'm going to want to be getting more play this game.
6232.96,6235.96," Let's maybe know, and I know that more people are going to buy that, then they're going to buy jam sessions."
6235.96,6239.96," And the thing is, the Disney people, they know they've got something special,"
6239.96,6245.96," and they won't give any specifics, but they are already thinking about other brands."
6245.96,6248.96, They can put on top of it to make it appeal more.
6248.96,6250.96, This is going to be a lot of information.
6250.96,6251.96," Yeah, definitely."
6251.96,6252.96, Yeah.
6252.96,6255.96, That was a strange aggression into non-games and kid games.
6255.96,6256.96, Yeah.
6256.96,6257.96, Back to a...
6257.96,6260.96, We fit as my choice for like the overall potential.
6260.96,6261.96, What's your emotional choice?
6261.96,6263.96, My most choice is a little big planet.
6263.96,6269.96," The more I think about it, the more I had so much fun, I felt like a little kid, again, huge toy box,"
6269.96,6272.96," just doing whatever I want, building things, the idea of playing with..."
6272.96,6275.96," With a few three inviting you into my room, hey, let's make a level and play."
6275.96,6279.96," I can imagine going up to the wee hours of the night, and every night, seriously."
6279.96,6281.96, I think it's a huge new idea.
6281.96,6284.96," Yeah, I mean, we took it back this last night, and she was like..."
6284.96,6286.96," No, no, no, no, still a skip."
6286.96,6292.96," Yeah, I think when that game comes out, I could see that being in my PS3 more than anything else, definitely."
6292.96,6293.96," Yeah, so that's mine."
6293.96,6294.96, I'm a new rank guy.
6294.96,6304.96," I would say, so before I came to the show, I thought it was going to be between Rock Band and Call of Duty 4, a modern warfare."
6304.96,6309.96," And having had hands-on with a little big planet today,"
6309.96,6315.96," and then also getting sort of like a breakout session where the guy's working on the game, talked about it."
6315.96,6319.96, I would say that I would have to give it to a little big planet by a nose.
6319.96,6324.96," I just think that the deep level of thought that's gone into it,"
6324.96,6328.96," I mean, it's just such a well-conceived game."
6328.96,6331.96, The interface works really well.
6331.96,6336.96," It's like action-level design, cooperative, platforming."
6336.96,6338.96," I don't know, it's just..."
6338.96,6339.96, It's just...
6339.96,6343.96," It's just a big-ish problem, as it's being launched when the device is $599."
6343.96,6345.96, It is a big-ish problem.
6345.96,6347.96," But it's evolving, it's a start."
6347.96,6352.96," And if you talk to those guys, it's almost like they're inviting everyone to come and join the development process with them."
6352.96,6353.96, It's almost like that.
6353.96,6354.96, It's like they're doing it.
6354.96,6355.96," Yeah, it's like..."
6355.96,6357.96," Let's hope the price drops, so more people can join in."
6357.96,6359.96," It's a grand adventure, we're going to work with you."
6359.96,6362.96," Seriously, so I mean, is that your personal choice, or is that you think the big picture choice?"
6362.96,6366.96," I think it's the big picture choice too, because you look at what..."
6366.96,6368.96, I'll get to the back.
6368.96,6370.96, I'll come back with my own role in the mention.
6370.96,6373.96, I want to say what my personal choice is every day shooter.
6373.96,6374.96, For PSN.
6374.96,6376.96, So I'm one of those guys who's blistering as thumbs.
6376.96,6380.96, When you guys had the show where you guys were talking about...
6380.96,6381.96, Start as a superstar at a stage.
6381.96,6385.96," Superstar at a stage, yeah, I was nodding at home, listening to it, because I love that game."
6385.96,6386.96, Berns my thumbs.
6386.96,6390.96," But as much as I love superstar at a stage, and I love that game,"
6390.96,6393.96," I love res, I love every extent extra."
6393.96,6396.96, And every day shooter just pushes all my buttons.
6396.96,6399.96, Like the art school side of the music side.
6399.96,6400.96, And when you...
6400.96,6404.96, It's this weird sort of disjunk between doing something you do all the time
6404.96,6407.96," and twin-stick shooters, which is shoot stuff."
6407.96,6410.96, And then have these different sounds that come out of it.
6410.96,6414.96," So when you're wailing on something, and it sounds like you're doing a guitar riff,"
6414.96,6417.96," I mean, it's just this synchronicity that's really powerful."
6417.96,6421.96," And then on top of it, the vector art style, which is just kind of..."
6421.96,6424.96, So it looks like this weird modern art kind of stuff.
6424.96,6428.96," And then the fact that each level, the cool thing about twin-stick shooters is you can..."
6428.96,6431.96, You hit a point once you've got it as you just zone out kind of.
6431.96,6434.96, You just move and shoot and move and shoot and you're just kind of like looking in your...
6434.96,6436.96," Your brain's almost not active, right?"
6436.96,6443.96," With this, there's almost two stages to each level, because the chain system is different for each level."
6443.96,6446.96, So it's almost like each level is its own game.
6446.96,6448.96, It's own twin-stick shooter game.
6448.96,6450.96, So what you have to do the first part is exploration.
6450.96,6454.96, It's really figuring out what are the rules for this level.
6454.96,6456.96," And then once you have that, then you can zone out."
6456.96,6459.96," And so it's almost like this bifurcated experience, and I just..."
6459.96,6460.96, That just spoke to me.
6460.96,6462.96," That's really cool, so..."
6462.96,6464.96," The honorable mention, not even honorable mention,"
6464.96,6469.96," like special citation, special jury prize, is the camera..."
6469.96,6471.96, The recording system in Halo 3.
6472.96,6474.96," Oh yeah, I think that's absolutely mind-blowing."
6474.96,6476.96, And so that was what I was going to get back to with.
6476.96,6478.96, This whole user created stuff.
6478.96,6483.96," I hope, not every shooter is going to warrant it, because not every shooter is going to be that powerful."
6483.96,6489.96," But I really hope a lot of developers think about ripping off that whole recording system,"
6489.96,6492.96," because you can record campaign, you can record multiplayer."
6492.96,6498.96," I asked a Franco Connor how much data it was, because I'm figuring knowing what little I know about how games are architected."
6498.96,6502.96," You don't need to send the whole video, just to send the data."
6502.96,6503.96, It's just the movement data.
6503.96,6505.96," Yeah, five megabyte files."
6505.96,6514.96," You know, so that kind of thing, so topping into the whole YouTube, my space, all that stuff that Ricka Teller was saying at the start of the week,"
6514.96,6516.96, the games have to compete with.
6516.96,6519.96," Well, games can compete with that and bring it interactivity to the table."
6519.96,6520.96, So I think...
6520.96,6521.96, And personalize it.
6521.96,6522.96, And personalize it.
6522.96,6527.96," And you know, so we were talking about the downloads and..."
6527.96,6529.96, ...unrele turn them in and that kind of thing.
6529.96,6531.96, You can create your own stickers in a little bit planet.
6531.96,6532.96, And that kind of stuff.
6532.96,6533.96, So I think...
6533.96,6536.96, I think little bit planet definitely signal something big.
6536.96,6537.96, Yeah.
6537.96,6540.96," And even if it's not ultimately the huge success because of the high PS3 price,"
6540.96,6543.96," it'll still have an impact on the industry, because they're saying even within Sony,"
6543.96,6546.96," and just other developers, their media drinks, they want to do stuff."
6546.96,6550.96," So imagine, like, you know, sackboy running around with that hellgain helmet,"
6550.96,6553.96," or, you know, sort of like the sword from Heavenly Sword."
6553.96,6554.96, Yeah.
6554.96,6556.96, And it doesn't mean that you're saying that it keeps you in Sony.
6556.96,6560.96," You're coming up and be like, I want to make a level set and item set based on our game."
6560.96,6561.96, Oh.
6561.96,6563.96," I mean, I think most Sony franchisees..."
6563.96,6564.96, You're going to see that.
6564.96,6565.96, That's really cool too.
6565.96,6566.96, Yeah.
6566.96,6567.96, It's really weird when you have the...
6567.96,6569.96," When they go really deep into the IP that they own,"
6569.96,6571.96," you have the little big planet, lemon, and little..."
6571.96,6572.96, You know?
6572.96,6573.96, You know?
6573.96,6577.96," Do you can do all that stuff, you can make a tank and then give it to your friends?"
6577.96,6578.96, And give it to your friends.
6578.96,6579.96, And just...
6579.96,6581.96," Honestly, it's just..."
6581.96,6582.96, It's so mind blowing.
6583.96,6584.96," You're like, I've got to fire out."
6584.96,6586.96, It's fully of a choir in this room.
6586.96,6588.96, It's how I felt when I saw Spore for the first time.
6588.96,6591.96," But like, it's weird because Spore because it literally is like,"
6591.96,6594.96, World creature and it feels bigger.
6594.96,6596.96, But when you start thinking of the implications of what you can do with
6596.96,6600.96," a little big planet, it's like jumping inside your own Saturday morning"
6600.96,6601.96, cartoon and make it the way you want.
6601.96,6603.96, And what we took by the CGC the same way.
6603.96,6605.96, I think a lot of people look at it and they...
6605.96,6607.96, And this is where I think where we...
6607.96,6608.96, We... we... we... we... we... we... we...
6608.96,6611.96, But has we shit on it. And she looks at it as the game that you play.
6611.96,6613.96, And it's where it looks like it's not about that.
6613.96,6616.96," The process of... it's almost irrelevant once you get to the game,"
6616.96,6619.96, because it's almost... I could say getting to a point where you build something
6619.96,6622.96, and refine it and tweak it and you play it through a couple of times.
6622.96,6625.96, And then it's the sort of... that's... that's... that's your gift to the community.
6625.96,6626.96, Getting there is something.
6626.96,6627.96, Getting there is something.
6627.96,6628.96, Getting there is most of the fun.
6628.96,6632.96," Yeah. Like, I'm not saying that a level and a little bit planet is going to be as good as the best level you've played in Super Mario Bros."
6632.96,6633.96, Right.
6633.96,6635.96," But she was like, oh, the levels look like it's just a challenge to the finish."
6635.96,6637.96," And I'm like, why aren't you care?"
6637.96,6638.96," Well, I..."
6638.96,6642.96, Someone's going to recreate Super Mario Bros. in Little Big Planet.
6642.96,6646.96," Oh, one second. I don't think that the playing part of it is that..."
6646.96,6647.96, Is that small part of it?
6647.96,6649.96," No, no, no, it's just been not talking about it."
6649.96,6653.96," I mean, personally, they said that today in their breakout session is just that they're not talking about it."
6653.96,6659.96," So one example they gave is, you can set a start point and a finish point in the level."
6659.96,6663.96," When someone runs past it, it triggers a stopwatch."
6663.96,6667.96," So, well, time, the time is the best times or whatever time you get."
6667.96,6671.96," Well, automatically be posted as a leaderboard for your level."
6671.96,6677.96," And they said you can attach the finish point or the start point to a moving object in the game,"
6677.96,6681.96, such that part of the whole thing is chasing the finish line through the level.
6681.96,6683.96," Well, another thing they haven't shown yet."
6683.96,6685.96, And they're going to show a TGS.
6685.96,6687.96, And it is. So there's a lot to...
6687.96,6689.96," And when you create something, I mean, when you create something,"
6689.96,6693.96, it that elevates the enjoyment from getting into it.
6693.96,6699.96," I mean, just sharing on the online, but I think the other thing is, you're going to be able to be able to be in your house."
6699.96,6701.96," You're going to be able to say, look what I made."
6701.96,6705.96, And people that don't give a shit about video games are going to look at it and it looks so awesome and like it.
6705.96,6707.96," And it's going to be like, wow, you did that."
6707.96,6710.96, And they're going to sit down next to you and show me how you did that.
6710.96,6712.96, It's going to draw people in.
6712.96,6714.96, I agree. I agree.
6714.96,6716.96, You want me to pick up next to you next to you next to you.
6716.96,6722.96," So I think there's going to be a lot of talk about the technical impressiveness of the shooters from, you know, crisis."
6722.96,6725.96," Obviously, blowing people away, Call of Duty for an its presentation."
6725.96,6729.96," And kills on, obviously, which made a great showing, great showing."
6729.96,6733.96, But I don't know that just that technical glamour anymore is going to get it done.
6733.96,6736.96, I'm going to say that what you came into the show thinking was going to be it.
6736.96,6738.96," I mean, rock band is amazing."
6738.96,6741.96," And after all your guitar here, I was just..."
6741.96,6743.96, I was just keeping it real with guitar here.
6743.96,6746.96, I really wanted to extend that guitar here was still a fun game to play.
6746.96,6748.96, But rock band is a tremendous evolution of it.
6748.96,6752.96," And in most importantly, to me, as someone who loves playing guitar hero,"
6752.96,6755.96, the music deals that they have in place.
6755.96,6759.96, Full albums make this game a behemoth.
6759.96,6760.96," Yeah, and it is going to..."
6760.96,6763.96, If I think it is going to steam roll through the market.
6763.96,6766.96," If I can go ahead and buy my favorite albums, that's brilliant."
6766.96,6771.96, The amount of money they will be able to take from me on a weekly basis is stupid.
6771.96,6774.96," You're going to spend $1,000 on rock band."
6774.96,6777.96, And the record industry has got to love it because this is stuff that they can...
6777.96,6779.96," You know, it's a catalog."
6779.96,6784.96," The thing you'll see is that you again, you know the reason that they don't show catalog sales on the 100..."
6784.96,6789.96," You know, top 100 charges because catalog sales out sell most albums like on a regular break."
6789.96,6791.96, But they'll be able to monetize that stuff.
6791.96,6794.96," But the other thing that's interesting, little slight depression, is that..."
6794.96,6798.96," You see, I know Motley Crude did this and other bands do it."
6798.96,6806.96, They'll re-record their own hits and sell them because they can cut out the record label of like most of that deal if they re-record the album.
6806.96,6811.96, And so I think you're going to see a lot of these bands because you were talking about like slash doing his own things.
6811.96,6816.96, Like imagine re-recording some of these versions or doing an acoustic version or something like that.
6816.96,6818.96, The pos... and that's like why?
6818.96,6819.96," I mean, I'll go..."
6819.96,6824.96, Can you imagine if some artists take the MTV unplugged culture from the ITs in early 90s?
6824.96,6829.96, But the only place to hear an unplugged version of a song is...
6829.96,6830.96, In Bobbam?
6830.96,6831.96, Oh my gosh.
6831.96,6833.96, And then the option to buy.
6833.96,6834.96, Yeah.
6834.96,6837.96," You know, and sort of transfer of secured digital file that you can listen to and take with you."
6837.96,6838.96, It's...
6838.96,6841.96," There are people... the question is going to start to come up is like, is this a fat?"
6841.96,6842.96, Is this going to go away?
6842.96,6845.96, But I think the basic concept is so strong.
6845.96,6847.96," You know, love for music is not going to go away."
6847.96,6852.96, And the idea that your songs that you love outside of the game can now be fun in the game.
6852.96,6853.96, I don't see losing that.
6853.96,6856.96," Some people may go away... like, from everything."
6856.96,6857.96, But others will just kind of come in and join.
6857.96,6858.96," It's, yeah."
6858.96,6859.96, Such a smart idea.
6859.96,6861.96, So you all know what my emotional choice is.
6861.96,6864.96, I'm going to haven't made any bones about it.
6864.96,6871.96, Mass Effect is... plays... plays every string of my mind and my heart...
6871.96,6872.96, I'm everywhere.
6872.96,6874.96, I'm going to be talking about the bunch this week.
6874.96,6877.96," And you know when mentioned the AI problems, I'm talking to Mark and he said that they are"
6877.96,6879.96, that your buddy AI is going to stuck on walls a lot.
6879.96,6881.96," And like, wonder if that's going to be ironed out in time for release."
6881.96,6886.64, for release. I think Mark was over-overly concerned about that. In the first time
6886.64,6891.6," they ran through that demo, the maneuvering system has been streamlined so"
6891.6,6895.44," significantly that it really amounts to, I barely even noticed it as he was"
6895.44,6899.2, running up into the area where the guy's got too far ahead and got jammed up. He
6899.2,6902.76, threw the marker that tells your guys where to go way too far out ahead of
6902.76,6905.28," himself and didn't, I guess he didn't notice it and then he was like, oh gosh,"
6905.28,6908.72, they went and killed everybody and they were bouncing around through the room.
6908.72,6911.84," But I mean, that's a, I mean, a, I routine is something you're tweaking up to the"
6911.84,6914.76, very end point. So I know I'm not concerned about if it's broken when it comes
6914.76,6919.16," out, sure that would be a severe disappointment. But everything else, the combat was"
6919.16,6923.240000000001, really fun when he ran through it the second time and didn't accidentally send
6923.240000000001,6925.92," them out so far that they went through and basically cleared the, cleared the"
6925.92,6930.240000000001, level out by themselves. It ran really well. He was having a good time playing a game. He
6930.240000000001,6933.320000000001," was able to play it, you know, at once, both like a shooter, a third person action"
6933.32,6938.639999999999," game and a role playing game, the, the concerns people had about the combat being"
6938.639999999999,6943.32," to like full-spectrum or a-rush and to, to picky. I think those have all gone"
6943.32,6946.599999999999," away. I think they've been a really good balance without the storyline, the story"
6946.599999999999,6951.08," telling the, the digital actors and the holes, it's the package. It is the"
6951.08,6954.719999999999, package. It's what I want to do with my entertainment time when I sit down to
6954.719999999999,6959.96," play a game. So I, I was going to say a little big"
6959.96,6969.52," planet, but there's probably no need. We can hit rewind. I mean, for my personal one,"
6969.52,6972.6," it really is a toss up for me. There's a two very different games, one of them's"
6972.6,6976.52," Mass Effect and the other one. The two games that I most want to go home and play,"
6976.52,6979.68," a Mass Effect and burn out. Yeah, burn out for my number two after a little bit"
6979.68,6983.12," like like burn out just, I mean, you only showed the only show a little bit, but"
6983.12,6991.2, like the the handbrake turn parking and the fucking just the amount of imagination
6991.2,6994.72," and creativity, the way they were just like completely rethought what that franchise"
6994.72,6999.599999999999," is. I mean, they've kept it the essence of it, which is the crazy crashes. But there's"
6999.599999999999,7004.5599999999995," like it's, they've like thrown all the conformity of the racing genre out and"
7004.5599999999995,7007.04," just been like, we're just going to do what's fun. Well, I really had because between"
7007.04,7010.599999999999," three and and revenge, you know, it was incremental and this is actually a big revolution."
7010.6,7013.8," Yeah, and it's happy to see the criterion. I think it's going to be, I think it's going"
7013.8,7017.8," to be really influential and I think, I mean, I was watching the guy playing and then I"
7017.8,7022.92, put in the Alex was demoing it at the Sony thing and he painted the pad ever and there
7022.92,7028.08," was sort of little flashes of like crackdown and you know, a lot of sandboxy kind of game"
7028.08,7032.52," games. Is there a playment town madness? Yeah, but this is way beyond mid-nom madness."
7032.52,7036.360000000001," It's way beyond that, but it is that vibe. It is because we used to play Midtown"
7036.360000000001,7040.04, Manus and I'm not just just get together like in Paris and drive all over the place and
7040.04,7043.8," see what kind of crazy crap we could do and we'd make up our own little races, we'd run"
7043.8,7049.16," into each other, we'd grace through the art of three off, you know, all that kind of stuff."
7049.16,7053.96, And I was just seeing that like expanded on like tenfold when I was watching burnout.
7053.96,7056.92," Now, I'm not a judge this year. I don't know you, well, I'm going. Yes."
7058.6,7061.56, My prediction for what the judges are going to give it to his rock band.
7062.44,7069.32," Yeah, I think this rock band, I mean, it's not out yet, but I think it's probably one of the most"
7069.4,7074.12, powerful brands that they see a three in terms of just everyone's talking about it.
7074.12,7077.88," See, the rock band will win over a call to you for? Yeah."
7078.5199999999995,7083.0," I think so too. I think call to you as good as it is. It is still, you know, kind of seen it."
7083.0,7088.04," My problem with call to you is, is we were talking about fatigue earlier. It just should"
7088.04,7092.5199999999995, have fatigue. How many first-person tutors did we see in sequence all these press conference?
7092.5199999999995,7097.48," It looks like, I mean, it's almost like if you took the tanker level, the opening tanker"
7097.48,7101.719999999999, level from middle gear to put a bunch of buddies on it and brought it to life.
7101.719999999999,7107.0," But it's a shooter. It's just, and I was going to say when you're mentioning burnout is like a special"
7107.0,7112.839999999999, citation for all of us frame rate horrors to Alex Ward and to guys in any more.
7112.839999999999,7118.44," Yeah, there's something for me that's just powerful psychologically about 60 frames. The animation"
7118.44,7122.04," is so good in call to you before. Like, I like those developers, there was no other alternative."
7122.04,7126.44," They would not settle for anything. That's the best thing they would think of. I mean, those guys"
7127.4,7132.599999999999," demons. And if activation does lose the it engines, that's, I mean, it's no doubt why they"
7132.599999999999,7136.919999999999, invested money and let infinity war have the time to do this because those guys are in those
7136.919999999999,7142.599999999999," are, they are legitimate, top tier engine wizards. I accidentally offended Alex Ward by misploding"
7142.599999999999,7148.36," him because he talks a thousand words a minute. And I thought I'd heard him say that, that doing the"
7148.36,7152.5199999999995," crash mode wasn't possible because of the layout and it was just, it was actually the design choice."
7153.0,7157.240000000001, And he said that you've said it's not possible that it implies that there's a technical limitation.
7157.240000000001,7161.8," He goes there is not a technical limitation to anything that we're doing. Yeah. And he goes,"
7161.8,7167.080000000001," but getting this game running at 50, 60 frames a second was like putting a man on Mars."
7167.080000000001,7171.64," It was just like there was so much shit go and they did it at it like it's rock solid and it's just,"
7171.64,7176.4400000000005," it's just so beautiful. I mean, but you're also, right, you should come on, we played black,"
7176.4400000000005,7180.360000000001," we played pronounce, but I was going to have to say that shit out of it. But you have to remember"
7180.44,7184.679999999999," the reason it's a challenge. So for instance, the, you know, I know it's at the end, but basically"
7185.24,7189.719999999999," there is a, and I can't tell how big it is if it's a minority or a lot of people, but there,"
7189.719999999999,7194.679999999999, there are some people I've talked to who have been critical of Halo 3 single player and how it looks.
7194.679999999999,7198.04, And similarly critical is they were a multiplayer and saying they feel like it's just
7199.0,7203.0," resed up. You know, Halo 2, I personally don't think so. What I'm seeing more is that"
7203.5599999999995,7209.24, it's an arch style. It's a choice that they've made to maintain that look across generations.
7209.32,7214.36," But the thing with, um, Halo 3 didn't show well, by the way, didn't show well with this show at all,"
7214.36,7218.2," particularly well. It was shown in small group, you know, and there's a few number of people who got to"
7218.2,7221.16," see it. Most people saw that trailer, which was really, really, really cut off."
7221.16,7225.96, Charlie was badly cut. I thought that Halo 3 legitimately had a chance to be the game of the show
7225.96,7229.96," because I thought Microsoft would be shoving it in your face and really pushing it because it is there,"
7229.96,7235.32," you know, 900 pound gorilla for the fall. And yet that they really actually, I guess made this"
7235.4,7238.679999999999, strategic decision to downplay that and let all their other games shine.
7238.679999999999,7243.24," Well, the reception at God, I think speaks to why I think it was such a challenge for Alex because"
7243.88,7249.88," coming off of something like a Gears of War, like even going back to Call 22, the bar has been raised."
7249.88,7254.36," It was like always saying, the start of this generation was, we saw, you know, target renders from Sony,"
7254.36,7259.719999999999," and we saw, you know, uh, CG movie from, from bungee and all these things and it just weak."
7259.719999999999,7263.4," As journalists, we're not technical people. We don't know how hard it is to make that stuff happen,"
7263.48,7269.08, but we think that stuff should happen. And so for Alex to pull off what people expect to be the visual bar
7269.799999999999,7274.599999999999," for burnout at 60 frames on top of it, that's where the challenge came from."
7274.599999999999,7279.96," Actually, coming in the wake of like the disastrous demise of Renderware, real good. Yeah."
7279.96,7286.28," So even Kudos to him. Wow, what a show. I'm exhausted. I'm about ready to go to the funeral"
7286.28,7290.599999999999, march that's going up a ocean. That's where that's where you'll see me at GameCog's funeral free
7291.08,7294.84," which would start at at 420 on. Yeah, I'm a little late, but I'll catch up with this gun."
7294.84,7302.76," Off off to the 13th. Nice. All right, in guy Shane, John. It's been wild. There you have it."
7302.76,7306.68," Oh, do you think this will be the last one? I hope not. Something will happen."
7307.72,7310.68, Something will happen. Something will happen. There will be an event next year.
7310.68,7314.52," At some time, at some point, between May and July, I think there's going to be a lot of pressure to try and"
7315.0,7318.52," a lot of people were saying, July is the wrong time to be showing stuff. I think if they wouldn't have"
7318.52,7321.72," it like this, move it to Vegas, put it in a Venetian that's have it in late April."
7321.72,7326.200000000001," That's my theory. Anyway. All right. Well, come back next week. I guess we'll have,"
7326.200000000001,7330.6, some maybe closing thoughts. We'll have judges final selections to talk about. We'll be able to get a
7330.6,7334.52, good read on what the community's been really hot for and when what they're asking questions about
7334.52,7337.96," maybe we can address some games that I'm sure we've missed some games. Yeah, I got there's a lot of"
7337.96,7341.400000000001, DS stuff and PSP stuff we didn't get to talk about. Maybe we'll talk about that. So we'll do our best to catch
7341.400000000001,7346.200000000001, up on that. Bords.1up.com is the place to catch up with us on that and don't forget to check out
7346.2,7351.48, then guys site level up. Give us the full address. That would be hard. I don't even know it. All right.
7351.48,7356.679999999999," It's just Google and I crawl and level up. Yeah, there you go. Good block search. And subscribe to"
7356.679999999999,7362.28," that to it's good RSS feed to keep it on your on your reader. Thanks. Until next week, we are gone."
