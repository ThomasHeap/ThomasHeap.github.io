13.36,19.64, It's gonna be a good one. We are all high on PCP. We had there's been about like eight cans of coke drunk between us
19.64,25.88, I just saw a freaking car bike accident outside. I'm all hyped up on real violence
26.4,32.92, I don't need your video game vibe. There was no GTA. It was no GTA the guys I didn't see the guys health meter go down or anything
32.92,36.48, I'm making jokes the guys like lying in the street literally bleeding
40.64,47.56," Green like in all the games I play yeah, no, it was kind of creepy guy got hit by a guy hit by a car"
49.480000000000004,51.480000000000004," Already, I'm bringing it down"
51.48,57.279999999999994, Was he like walking up right afterwards or I was thinking they probably didn't have a physics card for this thing the way they got
58.559999999999995,61.839999999999996, Did he turn into a perpetual motion? She just bike was like spinning around
61.959999999999994,67.67999999999999," Yeah, he got caught in the clipping. He was just like hanging in the air spinning around upside"
68.96,72.72," Thank you for making a call on it. Yeah, the I was what I went up and said to him"
72.72,74.32, Your rag doll physics are all wrong
74.32,80.56, So easily it was nice to know whatever that happens to the game. I was gonna draw a look to the Petra motion machine
81.48,85.60000000000001, Everyone gather around is see the body that's like twitching around nonstop
89.76,97.92," Okay, so we're here. We're ready to talk amongst ourselves and all the GFW crews here this week again"
97.92,103.5, Yay and that is amongst the following people Ryan Scott Darren Gladstone
111.48,116.72, But cuz it reminds us of when grandma led to his command and play
118.12,120.12, So that was Sean
122.52000000000001,127.56," I thought you could just go through the whole podcast as we're out here. So yeah, I didn't know it was gonna just realize that"
128.4,134.32, That the horrible song like was more or less a TARD squeal with like a reverb on now
134.32,140.92000000000002, So I wanted to I wanted to expose that that could have kept going. I was good. I was waiting for it out
142.44,144.44, The tough kids go out and play to it
145.04,150.07999999999998," Okay, so we got a lot going on this week. We do apparently I said it every week this week. I mean it"
150.48,155.83999999999997, So we're gonna we're gonna dive right in with some what you plan and
156.48,161.98, Then we're gonna talk about I think we're gonna finally talk about this month's cover story with this company heroes
162.95999999999998,168.39999999999998," Opposing forces now that it's been that posing fronts. Oh, now that's been all over that web"
168.4,174.28, And then speaking of the web we're gonna have some heroes of the web
176.6,182.6, Couple true heroes and then we're gonna feature some news items including a real life hero of the web John Romero
182.76,184.76, I'm gonna get his on
186.76,188.76, What he's up to we love John
189.76,193.04000000000002, It's gonna be very flattering what we're gonna say it is we love John
193.95999999999998,195.95999999999998," Okay, so"
195.95999999999998,199.51999999999998, Darren I know you've been all hyped up about something you've been playing this week and
200.23999999999998,203.76," Jumping at the bit that talk about it all day. Yes, okay, so"
204.39999999999998,209.12, I don't I don't make any bones about being guitar hero fan because it actually let's me pretend I could play guitar for five minutes
209.35999999999999,215.88, So the 360 version comes out this past week and I picked it up and I just was figuring hey
215.88,220.88, You know this is USB port and the thing so I plugged it in the PC just to see what the deal was and it totally recognizes it
221.24,223.84, I mean the guitar just right out of the box just totally works
223.84,228.16," So there's a free game out there called frets on fire, which is basically a guitar hero"
228.64,235.0," knockoff sort of deal, but it's totally open source and you can let people are a lot of people online or providing their own tunes"
235.68,238.68, And you can map the 360 guitar to
239.68,245.68," Absolutely, so you can play guitar hero game on your PC where you're we're one the game is free and on top of that"
246.04,249.88, You can there's unlimited number of songs out there being generated for it real songs
249.96,251.88, Real well real songs original songs
252.24,256.04, stuff that's just being made by like you know copying games songs that are out there
256.68,259.44, So it's a it's kind of interesting word check out
259.96,261.48, So do you have to do any
262.0,270.04, Configuration to make it work. You know just I plugged it in and it recognizes all the buttons and everything all I had to do is turn on the game and just configure like you know
270.28,276.52, You know fret one is this button fret two is this button and that was it was an X-P or V star I did it next
276.52,282.52," B I haven't just tested out fully investing yet because I was kind of in a rush, but I think quantum frets is a little given to too much"
282.52,285.88," Yeah, okay, it actually being a guitar. Okay, the colored buttons. There you go"
287.15999999999997,288.15999999999997, Red
288.15999999999997,291.96," Okay, that was in the end the game they call them frets"
292.35999999999996,297.91999999999996, It's kind of hard but you know it held before they had this I mean granted it's still a plastic toy guitar
297.91999999999996,298.68, You plug-in
298.68,305.96," It's kind of hard to have a lot of them of cool. Yeah, but it's infinitely better. They fucked up world because they they just announced that the rock star one is out"
305.96,312.59999999999997," Right, yeah, and it's based on rock band rock band you got like a drummer and a singer and a bass player in guitars and you're also supposed to plan"
312.59999999999997,313.64, Line but it's like
313.64,317.91999999999996, Remember when we were kids just that guitar you get what you guys are us and you press the the fuck it
317.91999999999996,319.91999999999996, And when he barged it's like yeah
322.03999999999996,324.52," Or like hit sticks like no, you see"
325.24,329.34, I love those you see the commercial like this is the shit right here. I can go around
329.34,335.28, You know beat this on like my sister's head on my table at school and everything I hit is gonna have some different sound
335.28,339.08, And then you buy it you realize like no matter what you hit it or how hard you hit it it goes
341.15999999999997,345.4," Yes, no matter like it's kind of like the 3D glasses that you say advertise in the back of comic book"
345.4,347.4, It is not 3D glasses like the X-ray
347.4,351.38, The X-ray thing you could see that's stuff that claws on stuff is all lead in work
352.0,354.55999999999995, But all these things were so decided
357.84,364.71999999999997," No, but the hit sticks in the jam on guitars were like so decidedly on the game, but now we've got this version where people like"
365.28,367.96, Know what we're gonna get the band we're gonna get a band together
369.96,373.64, Are you ready? I'm gonna come true right talk about wash. I imagine like one of us singing
374.2,378.76," Who's I got deeps on the singer on the microphone? Yeah, I think that's the one that knows not like any"
379.08,382.88," Cariaki, okay, right? That's fine. Well, yeah, I mean, I try to avoid that"
383.28,387.47999999999996," Me too, but you played you like the hell out of guitar here. Oh, though it ain't you that's fun"
387.59999999999997,393.08, But like I mean when you start bringing in like air drums air on a guitar and it will you know like yeah
393.08,397.12, That's gonna look pretty dumb sitting by your 360 there in the sound coming out of there
399.8,404.84, I know you know I really like the fair try I really like a guitar here. One guitar here or two
404.84,407.4, I got I got a new guitar for guitar here or two
407.4,412.0, But I could never play it because it got ruined for me the night that I brought the new guitar home
412.0,419.44, I had to stop first at my kid's school for a parents meeting and I was holding the thing and I ran into a
419.44,424.08, Southern dad and this this who's not a gamer whatever and he's like is that like a Fisher price toy
424.08,429.9," And it wasn't kidding. Well, it's like no, no, this is like I was like no, no, this is like this really cool"
429.9,433.3, Game and he's like so why you press like the color buttons to make notes
434.92,441.64," Okay, quit reducing it in that way. It's just more than that teaches you to count as every time you hit one of the quote"
441.64,443.64," Oh, Fred's it's like hey"
443.64,447.88," Yeah, I couldn't play it. I brought it home. I was like oh fuck he's right"
448.88,454.28," It is a Fisher price toy, but it is so much natural guitar right why the base I know how to play the base"
454.28,458.36, But that's a to get if you start playing on the like the really a hard difficulty level
458.36,459.71999999999997, Something like game you might as well be a guitar
459.71999999999997,461.71999999999997," Yeah, yeah, well it's not gonna make you a guitar"
461.71999999999997,466.2, You might but you might as well if you invested the same amount of time and energy into learning a real guitar
466.2,470.28," Yeah, I probably deal to play like stairway to heaven intro like the rest of your eighth grade class, you know"
470.28,472.96, That's exactly it like remember when like when the phone the first one came out
472.96,474.91999999999996, And they're I forget who was dad of the shirt that is
475.47999999999996,479.15999999999997, I was one guy in the office who was playing the game when the first guitar hero came out
479.15999999999997,481.15999999999997, He was playing on expert level like flower baking
481.79999999999995,485.55999999999995, Maybe it's Joe must have been but Joe's like a tar player right. I don't know
486.2,487.55999999999995, They're barely transferable
487.55999999999995,491.7," It is it's totally not transplants. Yeah, not transferable. It was like the way he said the way he told me was like"
491.7,493.64," It was like relearning how to play guitar. Yeah, like"
494.28,496.03999999999996," Yeah, or actually"
496.03999999999996,500.2, Unlearned how to play. I haven't been like YouTube videos of like little kids playing this like with
500.2,505.32," The sound not even on you know, it's like pattern recognition. Yeah, I guess all it is in the same way"
505.32,507.32, Simon like the doctor's coming
507.96,513.48," For the Nintendo yeah, right that was especially bad though because unlike guitar here half the songs in there"
513.72,517.56, Don't even match up to the beats and then they would choose like you're like okay
517.56,519.88, Like let's do a song about let's do a game about drums
520.2,523.24, But then they pick like Mary had a little lamb and stuff like
523.8,525.8, Oh the drums are ill in that joint
525.8,530.76, Like or like like random scrap like it's like he'll loosen the news or whatever. I'm like
530.76,534.04," Yeah, that's great. Yes, it's like scissor drums in the background"
535.9599999999999,541.4799999999999," Well, you expect you to like bottom on like all those slow jams come with pre-programmed drums with up with that"
543.0799999999999,547.88," Okay, so but we've yearned way off already, but yeah, but the whole that MPC"
548.12,551.4799999999999," But yes, we're going to do it for free on a PC"
551.88,553.4799999999999, That's cool except the cost of the guitar
553.48,556.84," But it's so good if I let the guitar you still got about the key to our, but if you already got it"
556.84,560.04," You know, you already have it for your acts. Thank you for you know, Frank you go to Hollywood be proud"
560.04,564.6800000000001, You could maybe like I mean like safe you've got your own garage band or something and you want to turn your
565.08,569.44, Your horrible songs into like horrible games for people you can probably upload those
571.88,573.88, What a ring endorsement
574.36,576.36," Yeah, get proud of the monocos"
577.24,579.8000000000001, Turn your horrible songs into horrible games
579.88,581.88, So
581.88,585.4799999999999, So so I've been playing a couple things. What are they I?
585.4799999999999,591.1999999999999," Well, one is infernal and I said a week or two ago here that if the game got better"
591.1999999999999,593.1999999999999, I would come on here and eat my words
593.8,597.52," That did not happen. No, I'm kidding it did that did happen it got better"
597.52,601.1999999999999," Sorry, let's say that they'd eat the white team in these that have been made about"
602.16,606.54," Your last well listen, I don't do it. I don't take back the stupidness of the plot"
606.54,611.9, The plot is still completely in fact it actually gets dumber as it goes on because you know
611.9,614.0999999999999, You're a fallen angel. I'm gonna spoil it
614.0999999999999,619.7199999999999, So if you really care about the platform infernal maybe hit pause or fast forward on your on your
620.2199999999999,621.2199999999999, podcast playback
621.2199999999999,626.6999999999999, But so you're a fallen angel you're like working for Satan hour whoever they don't actually calm Satan
627.26,629.26, And you're fighting heaven
629.26,634.54, But then it turns out that like the forces of heaven are like bad so actually you're a good guy after all
634.54,636.54, That's like what a twist oh shit
636.8199999999999,641.24, Which is like my might be mildly offensive at the Sunflokes. I would thank that's pure blast
641.24,643.24, That's pure battle right there
643.24,648.42, It's like a lot of what I played early on though. I mean like that game price the gravitas of like doll man versus demonic toys
648.42,650.42, So I'm really no
650.42,655.3399999999999, It's at least Iron Maiden's Eddie on the back of a dead end of the vest and in fact that's kind of a soundtrack
655.3399999999999,658.02, They've got gone every time there's any type of shooting
658.02,661.8, You know you're gonna start shooting because they crank up that like 70s arena metal
661.8,667.24," You know the truth which is okay, I'm doing this is again"
668.8399999999999,671.16, And the gameplay's wrote in the AI sucks
671.88,674.3599999999999, But I'm not that now
674.92,681.12, There's those quite a bunch of sequences later in the later part of the game that are I found very entertaining
681.12,683.92, So I was enjoying it myself and spider myself
683.92,687.4799999999999, I was actually wondering out loud you guys earlier if it was in fact
688.0,690.36, Stockholm syndrome which we've talked about before
690.36,693.88, Because sometimes when you're just forced to play a game you end up you're
694.36,700.12, You start liking it just because you're kind of trapped like if I'm wasting my entire weekend on this it must be good
700.28,705.2, But it really was I was finally I was getting less frustrated and I was getting more entertained
705.2,708.0, It's basically an amalgam of like every single thing
708.6,713.96, Every other shooter is kind of done before it's sort of it's more in the half-life to or half-life series school of
714.9200000000001,720.5600000000001," Puzzles and shooting rather than just straight up shooter. Yeah, so you keep getting to places in the levels that are like"
720.5600000000001,726.88," Hmm, well, how do I get past this place and you'll be stumped for a while and a bunch of the times the answer is"
727.2,732.1600000000001," Uttly annoying and stupid, but yes, you were the times it was pretty cool. Yeah"
732.1600000000001,735.2, I was guessing like use your temporary teleport to get through a barrier
735.2,740.24, Flipswitch that lowers the barrier go back to your original position. Yep walk through it. It's that stuff
740.48,744.62, You're that's not gonna be fun. That's not fun. It's fun. It's satisfying to figure it out
744.62,749.48, I mean if I describe half-life and like yeah find out that there's some obstacle a way about your gravity gun
750.76,753.32, Like we're saying before your tone of voice can change it
753.32,755.96, So solving some of those those puzzles is fun
755.96,759.84," Well, it wasn't like a bunch of annoying cutscenes that kind of spoil it for you like there aren't in fact"
759.84,763.72, Thank God because the one that there is is awful cutscenes advanced the story
764.24,766.24," Yeah, yeah"
766.24,768.48," Yeah, you still later on in the game like"
768.8000000000001,770.8000000000001, It's bulletproof
770.8000000000001,775.88," Yeah, but you know they did this along with having every other cliche of shooters in there"
775.88,779.44, They do the one where they take away all your shit like two thirds of the way through
779.44,783.44, I know I never seen that one before saw all the setting your back to having nothing and no
783.44,784.5600000000001, electronic power to you
784.5600000000001,789.16, You have your shoulder dislocated and have to put it back in like last week's loss
791.04,793.84, All right that hurt just brought it out
793.84,799.1600000000001, I'm just so painful when they do that. I've never seen anything that moved me that much since Rambo pulled out the bullets that
800.1600000000001,802.1600000000001, When we'll get it in the day
802.8000000000001,806.48, He did up his Rambo night Rambo heated up his Rambo night
809.72,815.12," So so anyway I was gonna I've been written the review yet, but it would have gotten a bad review and I'm actually gonna"
815.6,817.6, I'm gonna up it into the
818.44,820.44, Better range
820.44,823.82," Far but but it you know, I don't know how many other good"
824.5400000000001,826.74, Single player first person shooters are all these days
827.36,829.36, You know you just
829.6,831.96, Have some time to kill them like to play that kind of thing
832.9200000000001,838.94," Maybe not a bad choice no multiplayer in the game by the way. It's all single player and it was pretty long too, so it was"
840.6,842.6, Bang I'm done
842.6,848.7600000000001, Nothing's fair enough the other game I want to talk about though is I finally started playing salmon max. Oh cool episode one
849.12,854.36, Ben frickin testic. I love it and I'm really sorry
854.36,859.56, I waited until now to start playing it. I don't know my problem is actually the good news is you start playing it now and you'll be like
859.68,866.76, By the time the final segments ready you'll be caught up to it. I think I have to admit I think a part of me was
867.6,873.96, Where are you about being disappointed as an old school player who played the original salmon max and all those other look-as-harts games
874.48,880.2800000000001," I know we're gonna segue into Ryan talking about because our games for the moment, but but you know"
880.2800000000001,884.48, I really just thought oh this is gonna be like when Cosby came back the second time
884.48,889.08," It's just not gonna be as funny, you know, it's gonna be sort of like a pale imitation of itself"
889.08,891.88, But actually I thought the humor really was good
891.88,897.44, There's another example for the nerds out there would Frank Miller came back to not only the Dark Knight return
897.44,903.52," There you go, but all star Batman. Oh, it was God. He came back to parody of himself. That was red shit. Holy cow"
904.08,907.6600000000001," Dark Knight return was terrible. Well, well, did you read all star"
911.6600000000001,916.1600000000001," Sam I have to correct you because you're gonna have 10,000 yeah"
916.1600000000001,917.2800000000001, What I say wrong
917.2800000000001,922.8000000000001," Dark Knight returns. That was the good one. Dark Knight strikes again. Yeah, I didn't mean the first one right"
924.64,929.88, Thank you Ryan thank you Ryan. He were this thing strikes again when you compare it to all star Batman
930.04,934.36," Actually, I didn't finish strikes again. I didn't finish reading it. I put it away"
934.36,940.34, Why not not barley was coloring it? It was like you gave Ralphie the goddamn crayola box. Yeah digital crayola
940.34,943.96, right you can't even stay inside the lines. What the hell was that?
944.88,946.88, That's art
946.88,950.96, So I highly recommend it if you haven't checked it out. Is it only available on game tap
950.96,954.68, So it's a double first and then they've added later through the telltale
954.68,958.62," Okay, so if you are an adventure game fan if you're a fan of the old Lucas art games"

976.88,978.88, That's awesome that there are already five
979.84,985.32, They're actually episodic. There's one more in the season. I hope this leads them to do other
985.84,988.68, It's good stuff it really builds on the like
989.24,991.24, The recurring themes too like
991.56,993.96, Handles of a lot like I said come wood in terms of like
994.68,1000.28, Repeating jokes and it's not like bad repeating. It's like hey that actually built up to something after five episodes
1000.28,1002.28, I have really not
1002.68,1007.1999999999999, Literally laughed out loud at a game in a long long time and I did okay

1011.28,1018.24," Yeah, that was trying that was actually a humor game. Yeah, this one was trying to be funny and it made me laugh quite a bit"
1018.92,1020.92, So there you go
1021.3199999999999,1027.12, And I said I set yourself up there Ryan and there's a quote said yes speaking of Lucas art games
1027.4799999999998,1034.2399999999998, Yes speaking of salmon max. I've been playing some older Lucas art games over the past probably a couple weeks
1034.2399999999998,1036.2399999999998, But I've been playing them on my PSP
1039.6,1041.6, You're fired
1041.6,1050.3999999999999, I'm probably a little bit late to this but you can you can actually mod your your PSP
1051.0400000000002,1058.14, Who play things that you aren't really necessarily supposed to and somebody made a PSP version of the scumbian
1058.14,1059.02, Emulator
1059.02,1063.5, And we supposed to be plug in the PSP on the games for windows podcasts
1063.5,1065.8400000000001," Well, if you're hacking it some kind of like Microsoft device"
1065.8400000000001,1069.3600000000001, We actually this is a Microsoft play because now that Ryan's mentioning on the podcast
1069.3600000000001,1074.3600000000001, They're gonna like issue another firmware update or whatever that's gonna make so that you can't use the scumb awesome
1074.3600000000001,1076.8600000000001, But you will get the chain point for listening to this podcast
1077.4199999999998,1078.78, That's true
1078.78,1082.3799999999999, At least one please buy Microsoft products anyway continue right
1083.06,1089.9399999999998," So um, so somebody made this this version of this emulator for the PSP and it works surprisingly well for"
1090.3,1094.34, For these Lucas arts games so the total direct ports of all those well
1094.34,1100.1399999999999," It's an emulator that you run, you know, you copy your game and do a you know a folder and tell the emulator where to look and it loads"
1100.1399999999999,1103.9399999999998," You know, it's the original game and you can save your games and all that stuff save your games"

1168.54,1173.9," Yeah, I don't know if he's a car good if this and it's eliminated now a little bit of great gray area. You're right"
1173.9,1175.9, Thank you for calling on us
1175.9,1177.9, I guess we probably shouldn't be
1177.9,1182.8600000000001, But I guess I sort of what I was sick at two like I played and own all these games on PC
1183.26,1188.9399999999998," That doesn't necessarily make it does it. I'm playing the version. You know, I copied it straight from my CD rom"

1730.4599999999998,1735.6599999999999," Right, sorry, so yeah, the words are issues out now the press release went out for the game. Yeah, huh"
1736.4599999999998,1739.6599999999999, So it seems like I'm gonna have to refresh my memory because in magazine time
1739.6599999999999,1745.6599999999999, It's been quite a while since I went to Vancouver and visited relic in their studios there and had a look at the game
1745.6599999999999,1747.6599999999999, That was one issue ago for us. I know
1747.6599999999999,1749.6599999999999, And that was about like
1749.6599999999999,1751.6599999999999, six days
1751.66,1755.18, So that's the sad thing we always talk about like I mean if we if we were online
1755.18,1759.02, We'd have it would be so much easier for the people that say you guys need something to talk about
1759.5,1762.78, It's like we have plenty to talk about but there's always a gag orders on everything
1762.78,1764.3000000000002, We do have to talk about it. Pretty much
1764.3000000000002,1769.74," Yeah, like any of this stuff like what I went and saw last week would be perfect too. You know, oh and it was so great"
1771.02,1774.0600000000002, But that's that's got that in so yeah
1774.8600000000001,1779.8200000000002, Company here is opposing fronts what we know it's a standalone game in the way that the last
1780.06,1782.06, Don of war
1782.06,1787.5, But they're smashing is the way that the darker say you know worked where you don't need to have the original game
1787.74,1789.74, And that's cool because
1789.74,1793.02, You're able to sell a lot more people on it and instead of you know
1794.54,1798.22, Sliced you know fragmenting your existing player base you're just adding to it. Mm-hmm
1798.22,1800.22, which is cool and
1800.54,1802.54, You play in it the big hope
1802.54,1809.74, Immediately when I went there. I think I was along you know I was I have this in common with everyone else that read the press release or got our issue and saw
1810.46,1814.46, You know brits and Canadians on the screens and didn't see you know the red army
1815.02,1816.54, Wasn't like
1816.54,1821.82," Well, what's going on you know, yeah, right and Hannah death and not only that weren't in the war and not only that"
1821.82,1825.4199999999998, And I'll have to justify this because I mean more power too. I love you know
1826.06,1833.34, But but you just looking at it from the gamers perspective you want variety you want something different and the worry is that if they do include
1834.3,1839.6599999999999," The Tommy's that they're basically gonna amount to reskinned, you know, yanks that they're gonna take"
1839.6599999999999,1846.1399999999999, You know American armies and just put new skins on and they're also not known for I mean when you're thinking of like a big variety of vehicles and stuff
1846.1399999999999,1851.06, I mean you've got I don't know pretty sharmers not that appealing to me the church holes and you know
1851.06,1857.1, Some of their lighter tanks the sentarance stuff. They're just they're not quite as exciting as you know some of the Soviet tanks
1857.6599999999999,1860.4599999999998, It uses and all the other you know wild stuff that they had
1861.42,1867.42," So and then I was looking for like okay, well, maybe they would have you know husky and Italy maybe they would have torch"
1867.42,1868.7, I mean
1868.7,1873.42, And maybe they'd have some differ you know different geography and looking maps and stuff
1873.42,1875.98," But once again, it was in it was like post-tay"
1876.22,1880.94," So I was really skeptical as like oh, no, what's the deal? And I'm being honest with this now"
1881.3400000000001,1884.6200000000001, About this night. I think I share that with a lot of people when they first saw it
1884.94,1886.94, But then they fired up
1887.26,1892.46, And Josh lead designer starts showing me the stuff and I was really like okay
1892.46,1894.7, I see what's going on here and basically
1895.74,1901.98, Without like spawning everything you know that we have in the story the brits play radically different you know
1901.98,1905.1000000000001, And radically different fashion than the American allies do
1906.38,1909.74, The whole way that like they're organized I mean so instead of having
1910.22,1916.22, No their HQ systems different every HQ they have is a mobile base that they can pick up and move and then when you park it somewhere
1917.1000000000001,1919.98, It deploys and so basically they work in a whole other way
1920.8600000000001,1926.6200000000001, Instead of trying to cap as much territory in as many resources as you can and then holding it down and creeping forward
1926.6200000000001,1934.78, You can just choose like we're gonna focus on these three and they were just gonna like detect them up so that they put out as much as the the five that the other guys hold do
1936.22,1940.54, The way that you know there's an officer system where captains and loutenets are working differently
1941.1000000000001,1944.3, then I mean even in the the because they have like the light net and
1945.26,1950.94, The varm oxide already but these guys work even you know in different way and so as I'm looking at it
1950.94,1953.18, It just turns out that it's really it's really cool
1953.18,1958.3799999999999, Like this is a whole another way to play and then when you start combining these guys especially when you're playing multiplayer and you combine
1959.58,1965.34, Like along any of the regiments because instead of you know Americans have companies and the their stocktions for the
1965.34,1968.08, Access and original company heroes that the British here have
1969.02,1973.18, Regiments and the pants are elite have there. I think they're back to doctrines too
1974.0600000000002,1980.22, So do you really think it's it's gonna change a lot of gameplay tactics then or gameplay strategies
1980.22,1985.98, That's I think it will massively change because I mean I'm kind of like as I'm talking like I keep stopping because I'm thinking like well
1985.98,1988.22," How much should I give away right now? You know, yeah"
1988.22,1991.02, I want some I want you kids to go and buy our goddamn magazine
1991.66,1995.1000000000001," But yeah, I mean I could all I'll pick one example"
1996.0600000000002,1998.0600000000002, And that would be
1998.0600000000002,2003.1000000000001, The way that the artillery works and they have the priest mobile artillery reunite the birds have the the priest mobile artillery
2003.74,2011.02, And not only is it mean you know you have firepower equivalent to the American howitzers where you're able to like just project your force across the entire map
2011.02,2012.54, But you're able to like
2012.54,2017.5800000000002, Stay mobile what you're doing it so that they can't you know figure out where you're at and come take kill you and take it over or whatever
2018.22,2022.38, But then the types of the varieties of fire that you're able to to employ
2023.1000000000001,2027.66, With these houters is just insane so one would be a walking barrage and that's basically where you
2028.3000000000002,2033.5800000000002, Draw out a line of fire in the same way that you would with like where you're you're gonna have your p47 going a strafing around or something
2033.66,2040.5400000000002, But you're basically gonna like walk artillery heavy artillery fire along that line so if you have a clear sense that
2040.5400000000002,2042.6200000000001," Okay, if I start artillery on this point"
2042.7,2047.3400000000001, They're gonna want to retreat this way and they're gonna retreat that way because it they're obstructed for many other angle
2047.5,2051.7400000000002, You can actually have them retreat into more artillery or something would be one example there
2053.1,2057.1800000000003, wildly devastating if you get this stuff on their back base because you can just draw a line
2057.2599999999998,2062.06, Basically across like some of their major structures rain hell in the that way at that point there are essentially bone
2062.7799999999997,2066.2999999999997, I don't know I don't think so because they still have there there's still a lot of options
2066.2999999999997,2069.18, There's some really cool stuff with the pans early that I'll have to talk about to you
2069.5,2072.2999999999997, But and then another option would be to designate
2073.2599999999998,2075.2599999999998, an area for
2075.98,2080.3799999999997," Counter bat not an area, but just a designate counter bat a barrage fire and counter battery fire"
2080.3799999999997,2082.94, And what that means is you're basically in lockdown mode
2083.02,2087.18, You're not doing anything but the moment that the access throws some kind of artillery or
2087.34,2093.7400000000002, Neville verifers or anything like that at you you're immediately gonna count a figure out work out the trajectory of that and then immediately
2093.9,2097.82, Retaliate with your own heavier artillery and more precise artillery
2098.86,2102.86, So that's a cool technique and then there's the other one where you designate an area that you're going to
2103.5,2107.82, Overwatch and so if something enters in this area like say there's
2108.78,2114.6200000000003," Like a resource right, but you don't have you have to move away from it and you're you're not gonna be able to defend it that much, but you still"
2115.26,2117.26, Wanna keep it like type area?
2117.26,2121.5," What um, one of the game. It's all I get yeah, I guess I'm assuming people know about the game"
2121.5,2124.94, But the only resources in our fuel ammunition and manpower
2125.7400000000002,2127.7400000000002, So no type area
2128.1400000000003,2129.34, No type here. No crypto night
2129.34,2133.34, But so like say it say if you'll deep out right you want to just cover it some important area for you
2134.3,2138.38, Or if like maybe there's an area you're trying to get your infantry to because you want the houses
2138.38,2143.5," The firing positions that it affords, but you're like hey, I'm gonna be a bastard if I can't get to it first"
2143.5,2146.94, I'm gonna just like do the whole thing so right as soon as they enter that area
2146.94,2149.34, You're gonna immediately start attacking him with your artillery
2150.86,2157.1800000000003, Load all the hell and that's just one of the regiments. I mean there's there's all kind I mean some of there's there's a lot of nuance in
2157.8999999999996,2163.98, The intelligence based one where you have the equivalence of the nigma cipher where you're able to keep track of what the enemies doing
2164.2999999999997,2169.18, What how they're organizing their tech tree when they're actually creating and deploying units
2170.06,2173.5, You create trying elation by setting up you know three mobile
2173.5,2179.18, I mean three of these like posts and then just basically opening the map through the fog of war in that area for you and then
2180.22,2183.02, Like a lot of red decoy stuff in that too. So like if you
2183.74,2187.9, You can you can spoof the enemy into thinking that artillery broads are coming down onto them
2188.86,2196.54, Or you could spoof them into thinking that a glider force is about to deploy and and for all the all the fun that comes out of that depending on how you know
2196.54,2199.9, Well you deploy your tactics. I mean you could tell your teammate
2199.9,2203.42," Hey, I'm gonna scare these guys right now and I'm just or I'm gonna convince them"
2203.42,2208.94," I'm just gonna repeatedly spoof with fake artillery to the point where they're like okay, this guy's just crying wolf again"
2208.94,2212.38, And then you can launch the real shit on them and just like lately in I-Latum
2213.34,2215.34, That stuff's really fun
2215.34,2218.54, And then since I'm on it now like in the way that the two
2219.5,2222.3, Army's like work against one another the access side
2222.62,2230.2," Have depends or elite and so you get to play as bananas now. Yeah, and the pans are elite is about as good at you fromism as any for SS"
2230.4,2231.9," divisions, I guess"
2231.9,2238.22, But I mean that's a key point in the game too because you can't play you do play one campaign from
2239.18,2246.06, The access perspective and that would be of course operation market garden and they know
2247.2599999999998,2252.8799999999997, I mean is any of it does like they didn't have to have someone coming in and say like you know that might be you know
2252.8799999999997,2254.8799999999997," some touch you such a better. Yeah, so"
2255.98,2259.98, They they made sure to in a way that satisfied them
2259.98,2263.66, I'm staying out of it. I don't know. I mean if I'm offended or not. I mean I'm still used to playing
2264.06,2265.66, I mean when you play work games from every
2266.06,2271.2599999999998," Perspective multiplayer anyway, I mean not to confess. I mean I know it's not shocking to me if I'm going to be just"
2271.58,2275.2599999999998, Like an average you know vermod soldier in whatever kind of scenario
2275.98,2280.3799999999997, As long as I'm not the Gestapo or SS it's not but not to hero you know
2280.3799999999997,2286.06," You know, I don't think their heroes are anything but because you it is a gamer you like that's an experience that I can go for it"
2286.06,2289.18, Be interesting to see how it works. I mean I'm used to playing and online
2289.18,2291.5, I mean it's the same thing everyone that's like no
2291.5,2295.26," You know it's joined in other game. I got divs on the exercise. You know, they have fun armor"
2295.26,2298.86, I mean they've got the fun hardware and stuff from from like the touching
2299.5,2302.62, History from it. Right right right from the topic the holocaust
2302.62,2307.66, Yeah from the toy perspective they got there's a joke sound bite. They got the good on her and stuff
2308.06,2313.18, But so what they're doing is they're they're picking a point in the war where they could say
2313.9,2319.18, It's they're no longer in the middle of an agret you know an active aggression and again
2319.5,2325.3399999999997, Now let's just put put quotes put parentheses around everything I'm saying you know this is I'm trying to to reproduce the point of view that
2325.8999999999996,2327.8999999999996, As it relics point of view as I understand it
2329.66,2337.8199999999997, So you got a point where they are basically falling back and they're attempting to you know defend the father land more so than than abiding
2337.8199999999997,2344.7799999999997, You know Hitler's can't put orders and stuff and worried about you know their wives and girlfriends and stuff back home and their families in
2345.6600000000003,2350.6200000000003, So I don't think that they're even especially interested and humanizing at that much
2350.6200000000003,2355.34, But it is something that's interesting to see what they do with it because the game does use cutscenes and stuff
2355.34,2357.1800000000003, I mean if it were just any you know
2357.34,2361.6400000000003, If it were just an RTS that just said here's a battle and let's simulate it in the same way that like you know
2361.6400000000003,2367.34, I'm playing I'll too and a lot of times you will do a mission from the left-of-off position right it just doesn't really bother
2368.0600000000004,2371.5800000000004," There's no characters or anything. It's like just it's just man in machines, you know"
2371.8199999999997,2376.46, But but this game can't just say that because it does have the cutscenes and you are supposed to say
2376.7799999999997,2383.98, You are supposed to identify with the people that you're fighting with and care when the next cutscene says that they've been killed or
2384.54,2386.86, You know so other turn of the tragic turn of events has happened
2388.06,2392.86," So yeah, that's I mean it's kind of make of it which will it's all gonna be I'm not gonna you know"
2392.86,2397.5, I'm just trying to rack my brain here about other games that let you play from the access side
2398.38,2400.38, Warfront turning point
2400.86,2407.9," So a lot of CDV games actually, no, but I think about it. Yeah, I could God just probably a bunch of people out there listening there like this"
2407.9,2412.38," This right now. It's a sporadcast seeing and we tend to have brain freeze. Yeah, it's like the same thing"
2412.38,2418.78, Into the days we're recording this I thought part of the plan. I don't they didn't do it though did they but I know at one point part of the plan for brothers
2418.78,2420.1400000000003, Normus was to
2420.1400000000003,2423.9," Do a little of that they were talking about that at one point. Yeah, I think it was for the second one"
2423.9,2427.42, I can see strictly from a you know a military strategy
2427.66,2435.1, Mr. Edgien's have you were that if you're that kind of player that the chance to play a different side where different tactics are being used and
2435.5,2439.9, Or maybe terrain makes it a bit of difference or whatever would be interesting
2440.54,2446.14," But the history is tough or it's gonna be tough for some people. Yeah, that's only yeah and so"
2447.58,2450.94, Another thing that sets that like in terms of action of that part of the campaign
2451.58,2452.86, um
2452.86,2457.58," Make clearly it was a it was a wipeout for before the allies at Mark Garden, but"
2458.3,2463.1, There'll be you know playing as a panser Lee you'll be blown up a lot of bridges and stuff like that like really cool
2464.62,2465.66, Using some
2465.66,2471.66, Really cool armor that we talked about in the story when I say armor like dark talk for tanks armor fighting vehicles
2471.66,2474.54, So you know self propelled artillery types
2475.9,2477.18, Personnel carriers
2477.2599999999998,2481.2599999999998, Which one cool thing about the game now is that you can actually garrison troops in you know
2481.58,2485.66, Half tracks and stuff in the same way that you I mean you could always put them in some place
2485.66,2487.8199999999997, But now it works in the way that that garrison
2487.98,2491.8999999999996, What garrisoning in a building wood so everyone is actually firing from it
2492.14,2496.7, So matter what they have so if you had a crew and they had like good five pans or strikes among them
2496.8599999999997,2500.7, They would all you could do a drive by out of tank with that that boy and like hate them with five
2501.2599999999998,2506.2999999999997," You know, so there's gonna be more fire power depending on how many guys are in there and at the same time"
2506.38,2511.5," For the reward there's the risk of someone to get an occurred aid, you know, and they're doing a three pointer on you"
2511.7400000000002,2518.3," Getting a grenade in there and then everyone jumps out of those cool mean animations and you see everyone just like man overboard scenario, but then I'll always make it"
2519.7400000000002,2525.82, And that stuff's cool. I mean again like they're really playing on the the detail of the engine to communicate
2525.82,2531.34, Things through the animation so you know the British guys when they they moved actually move differently
2531.34,2534.6200000000003, British infantry moved differently than the other armies so they have
2535.42,2542.06, Sort of a tentative cautious stance posture that they assume when they're in uncontrolled territory and they're it means that they're slower
2542.06,2546.8599999999997, But it also means that they're able to get the cover quicker and return fire faster if they are ambush or something
2547.74,2550.54, The bread side of the like the silly walks from money Python
2551.58,2554.7799999999997, So you could see all that yeah and
2555.3399999999997,2558.7, Other other big things that they're it relics introducing with the game
2559.4199999999996,2561.4199999999996, Was dynamic weather yeah
2562.22,2564.22," Dynamic weather okay, so"
2565.18,2568.7, They're in signing me a note given away too much okay. We'll just wrap it up then
2569.98,2571.98, I
2571.98,2576.7799999999997, The dynamic weather is cool. I mean it I think it's it's you're like a what's the big deal about that
2576.7799999999997,2581.18, But in material terms in in the way that you're going to experience the game it does matter because
2581.66,2586.7799999999997, If you're gonna have a persistent type mission where you go when you take one one bit of terrain
2587.26,2591.9, And then you're gonna hold that overnight and then the time is gonna change and it's gonna be another time of day
2591.9,2597.1000000000004, And it's gonna like retain all the damage that that you've done to the environment and then counter attacks gonna be launched
2597.34,2602.98, That's cool and then also just gives another vibe to the maps you've been playing I mean they're upgrading all the old maps with
2603.6600000000003,2608.6200000000003, With the new you know the extent support and the weather changes and all that so you think that's that's is gonna hit the
2609.02,2610.5400000000004, The performance though
2610.5400000000004,2615.7400000000002, I know I probably really early to say you can but I worry about things like that when I hear about weather systems
2615.74,2620.8599999999997," Yeah, oh great. I get to update it. It's a great. My process. That's actually empty. I'm saying weather and that's time of day"
2620.8599999999997,2624.9399999999996, What I'm talking about my weather of course that it can rain and maybe I will
2624.9399999999996,2631.02," I think it can slow down you think it's no one stuff and yeah, and it actually does it will turn turn dirt to mud and it can slow you down"
2631.02,2637.4199999999996, And it's so detailed that like if you do zoom in I mean you could actually hear the rain bouncing off your tank armor and stuff and
2637.4199999999996,2639.4199999999996, You zoom in DC their faces
2640.4599999999996,2642.4599999999996, Inside jokes
2642.4599999999996,2644.4599999999996, I'm sorry people will get that now
2645.74,2652.14," So yeah, I guess that's a nice that's about all Babylon about wait if if it's no"
2652.14,2656.14, Does a snow this is a serious question does a snow like persist on the ground?
2657.3399999999997,2662.06," Yeah, I don't think it's not like developers have been trying to grow doing it like I mean obviously in it"
2662.4599999999996,2664.4599999999996," Yes, it's not pulling off where every"
2664.8599999999997,2667.8999999999996, You know it's it's it's it's it's it's it's all polygon and then they
2669.2599999999998,2671.2599999999998, Kick it well under how many developers like
2672.14,2675.3399999999997, Can do it but just go that would just take up so much processing time
2676.14,2682.9399999999996," What's sure what they do is they swap in snow covered assets, you know, you basically they take the same asset the texture and then and then"
2682.9399999999996,2688.2999999999997, Pay repay the snow it would wouldn't it be great if like over that over time on a map if like a road
2688.2999999999997,2694.06," Just got like blizzard it in yeah, you know, then you just couldn't use it anymore or even let's say like you go over like a mudditch"
2694.06,2699.3399999999997, Money rotor or a was snowy road and like you can it leaves the tracks of the vehicle that went through it and then over time
2699.3399999999997,2701.5, It's like covered is it up so you don't know who is there?
2701.74,2705.74," I mean, there's versions of that like fighting games, you know like in debt or alive or something yeah, or"
2706.62,2707.9, You know or
2707.9,2712.3," fighter or whatever virtual fighter. Yeah, you're walking around the snow and you see your footprints are kind of like you know"
2713.1,2715.1, But that's a game played does it
2716.78,2721.82," Cross to visually actually gives you clues is there or whatever yeah, so yeah, so I mean ending on that"
2721.82,2726.46, I will say check out the story in the magazine of course because the the panzer leads
2727.42,2731.66, Doctrine's are really cool and again in the same way that the bridge stuff
2732.54,2735.58, Fundamentally different than then than the Americans
2735.98,2739.98, There's some up Sean says not these are cool is definitely different than the
2740.62,2742.86, That's the thread we can start here
2742.86,2746.78, On one up now you can I wait for you to get in shit cuz for the next two weeks are gonna be gone
2746.78,2748.78, I'm going to Ireland and um unique
2748.78,2753.18, So you're going to meet again all fits together. I was all making some
2753.18,2755.82," Perfect. Yep, I see cover story"
2756.46,2758.46, Two colors come out
2758.86,2763.82," So yeah, okay, glad you didn't talk about the biggest feature. Yeah, well the other things"
2763.82,2766.62, Dragons well the thing that was gonna transition with is
2767.34,2774.38, The next big topic we wanted to talk about around with what with what disappeared on one up and then also in the one of yours podcast
2774.94,2781.9, Is games for windows live initiative at how it's gonna work a big part of that has been asking third party developers
2782.54,2785.82, What you think of it and would you use it and while I don't have any
2786.2200000000003,2788.2200000000003, confirmation from THQ
2788.94,2796.14, It what they do tell me definitely sounds like they are really they really appreciate the possibilities of life and
2796.7000000000003,2800.3, Basically let me just say this I would not be surprised at all if in the future they announced
2800.54,2803.98, Gave so windows live support for their games so I'm not making the announcement
2803.98,2808.62, But right I would not be surprised you clarify no announcement has been made right but those actually
2808.94,2813.74, Does make some degree that's my own because he was choose for them pretty much earlier adopters with like the whole live service
2814.38,2819.8199999999997, Like with the I think that was it actually was really game on the 360 of the outfit was the same it was one of the first
2819.8199999999997,2824.46, Multiplayer game and also I mean company heroes as a game's ruined as branded game right there
2824.46,2832.38," Just one of the first to first to get that branding right so they're obviously early adopters about that yeah, and I mean we talked about this a little bit offline"
2833.1,2836.62," Before the podcast, you know the idea that for a game like company"
2836.7,2843.74, Heroes that was very critically claimed but maybe didn't sell so well right this is another chance for life for that game
2844.2999999999997,2849.74, More publicity for I just put it out there to a broader audience that game it makes a special sense to me because
2851.5,2855.8199999999997, See how much we have to fill listeners in but basically some of the content you know
2855.8199999999997,2861.74, Game is for those live from third parties has been the concern that if you do agree to off to to be part of the program
2861.98,2866.54, You're not going to be able to offer work around to non-life subscribers for the
2866.62,2873.2599999999998, Voice over IP stat tracking and ranking and stuff like that but because company here is doesn't use voice over IP
2873.9,2877.5, And it's ranking is stuff it it's nothing too spectacular
2877.58,2881.1," It's definitely there and they're matchmaking's there, but the matchmaking's really slow too"
2881.1,2885.3399999999997," And then wieldy for me it's not in wheeled use, but it's it's slow. It's kind of a burden"
2885.74,2890.22, I think that's a kind of game that they wouldn't really if they signed up they would suddenly be offering
2891.02,2896.22, Their users a good deal more of content and functionality without having anyone feel is
2896.2999999999997,2901.02, Though something it's been taken away from them or that they were being forced to pay
2901.4199999999996,2904.7, Right feet in order to access it and and you know achievements
2904.8599999999997,2909.74, I'm a skeptic of like how achievements but for the people that like them again you can imagine all the things
2909.74,2912.62, They would be able to do with company heroes and in achievements and stuff
2913.5,2917.74, Right voice over IP would be huge for it like that well the the games for Windows live
2917.74,2922.9399999999996, I mean you guys have talked about this a couple times on one up yours. It's it's been around so we don't have to go into right
2923.42,2930.14," Yeah, nausea but I mean obviously the bigger problem is it many many of the multiplayer games that are already big on the PC"
2930.86,2937.9, Are not like company heroes and that they do have very robust services. Yeah already for free
2939.26,2945.58, Exactly and so I mean you get you get in that scenario that I just described where as a consumer you see
2945.58,2947.58," Okay, I'm used to this and I'm used to that"
2947.8199999999997,2953.18, But why am I paying for it now where I wasn't paying for it before and then if the answer for some I mean
2953.18,2957.1, You know Peter Moore's answer was you know never underestimate the power of achievements and
2957.98,2963.98, Some of us laugh in the face of that others that I mean to be fair like I think if you are I think it's gonna be great for
2964.54,2967.58, Expanding maybe convincing some diehard
2968.14,2972.7, Xbox players to start playing on PC that's fantastic and they're gonna go like oh this is cool
2972.7,2977.66, I get to do all these things that there that Microsoft's promised them you know I get to have my same
2977.66,2984.7799999999997, Game or tag and I get to get more points here play on these games. I've always been interested in but I've kind of been worried about the complexity of the platform and stuff
2984.7799999999997,2988.7799999999997," But now will be a waste of time because I get achievements for it. Yeah, and they will think that"
2988.7799999999997,2994.8599999999997, I mean you know people in this building many many people in this building feel exactly that same way and you
2995.1,3000.9399999999996, You know you see them all the time and I was gonna use Sean Maloya of being an achievement horror when he said he was playing and saying
3001.1,3003.1, It was a workout
3003.66,3010.86," I've I talked about liking achievements on here. Yeah, yeah, don't don't be just to be I'm not I'm not lying with me. I mean right now"
3010.86,3015.9," Actually, I never quite but but it does make it does make less sense to me on the PC though"
3016.54,3023.02, I mean not the achievements part that when when if I have Xbox if I have sorry games for Windows live on my PC
3023.26,3026.06, I will probably be more on about the achievements there
3026.06,3029.5, But the problem for me is the barrier of the money
3029.9,3033.2599999999998, Like it's gonna be for many people the barrier of paying for something
3033.2599999999998,3039.02, It's getting free right the what's your paying is amounts to about four dollars and some change a month
3039.02,3044.42," Yes, it does and it doesn't add up to a whole lot and how I okay now before I know there was so I'm gonna say how much a month"
3044.42,3045.7799999999997," You pay for wow, but of course"
3045.7799999999997,3049.82, What you feel you're getting from back from that wow subscription is gonna differ from what
3050.2999999999997,3055.18, Live is offering you at first but correct the point is if you do if you are employed
3055.2599999999998,3059.18, If you are an employee person or something or you don't you know live with your parents or something
3059.5,3062.58, The money doesn't it's more the principle than that's yeah
3062.58,3064.58," Yeah, that's all"
3064.58,3065.58, Getting live for Xbox
3065.58,3070.06," No, I right I paid for that and I thought it was and I still think it's a great story"
3070.06,3072.22, And you will not as since you subscribe to
3073.02,3076.74, Xbox Live you won't have to pay anymore. You're already signed up for GFW live
3076.8999999999996,3081.8199999999997, And that's the other distinction that Microsoft wanted to make of course is that you're getting something
3082.6200000000003,3089.5800000000004," Extra for what you already are committed, but it's really more the principle as as coming from the point of view from guys like epic"
3089.5800000000004,3095.9," Yeah, that's where the problem is I think I'm just I'm playing devil's advocate the other way now because I played for the past year"
3095.9,3098.86, I've had to play them because that was that kid the other way
3098.86,3102.6600000000003," Like you know for the developers and against Microsoft and again, you know"
3102.6600000000003,3106.02," I don't want anyone to think that it's like go I mean a lot of people are like oh, he's you know"
3106.02,3110.9, Just completely ripped Microsoft or something because there's some some snippets of a larger
3111.38,3116.08," Sure views going up, but that's not the case at all. It's just it's just more I think it's more"
3117.2599999999998,3121.42, Formed it for everyone to to play you know play it against them
3121.42,3125.66, We're talking about the whole thing shows what a huge uphill PR battle
3125.66,3132.22, They have what this thing everyone's got reaction is what I do this a sound stupid right you know
3132.74,3135.8999999999996, I mean like we've already said I mean like I totally agree with Sean in that like this is gonna
3135.8999999999996,3139.66, I've had no brainer for anyone who's like a console gamer first and maybe a PC gamer in
3140.62,3142.58, Second if if that like they might want to
3142.58,3145.58," Did their foot in the water, but I don't know man like they"
3146.06,3148.54, Right if you've been a long time PC gamer this seems
3149.62,3153.22, Not necessary and obtrusive right well
3153.22,3159.1, I think and it and it makes you fear I mean because we've all been trained to fear the Microsoft board that it makes you
3159.1,3161.94, You've figured that here's yet another board like action
3161.94,3166.94, I'm just gonna take and co-op the space that doesn't necessarily but right like first they take over a magazine
3169.46,3171.58," No, but I just remember when when when live first came out"
3171.58,3173.98, You know with the original Xbox it was really it's the basic service
3173.98,3178.94, I mean it was strictly matchmaking and not much more than that right and as time went as time went on
3178.94,3184.0, 360 they started rolling in these you know more services more options and maybe that's what they're kind of going for
3184.0,3187.54, Maybe they're saying this I mean like at least the time I was times I've talked with those guys
3187.54,3192.74," It's been like okay, this is just the first step getting towards a bigger picture plan for what they want"
3192.74,3197.2599999999998, They do thing as they need to get to that bigger they need to get that step sooner if they want to get in
3197.2599999999998,3202.98, Tysmore PC gamers I don't know that after you were the explaining the you company of heroes philosophy of like
3203.1,3206.82," Okay, here's again that doesn't have a voice of our IP. I'm thinking maybe"
3207.06,3210.96," All it might take is a couple big games that don't have that yeah, yeah, yeah"
3210.96,3215.86," Unbored and then suddenly, but you know what if you just been trillow I mean like or any other free team speak"
3215.86,3219.36," You know whatever out there. Well, there's like there's a deal with you like coordination"
3219.36,3222.76," That's randoms. Yeah, you have to coordinate you have to say like a"
3224.26,3231.6600000000003, Here's like if just there if there's two games say that you play all the time company heroes and some other game that doesn't normally have built and boy for whatever
3232.1800000000003,3235.58, Suddenly maybe that four bucks a month or whatever is totally worth it
3235.58,3239.82," Right, so maybe like for a while you all been saying all right needs every developer unbored"
3239.82,3246.34," Process is gonna take a couple key ones, so maybe it's just a couple a couple of these ones that aren't necessarily the huge ones that offer this stuff already"
3246.34,3250.3, And might be the ones that don't the best case there you know
3250.3,3253.1800000000003, No initiative of the scale is like you know
3253.1800000000003,3259.06, Flawlessly and fully functional right off the bat right so it's gonna take time in the same way the every kind of big thing takes time
3259.5800000000004,3261.26, the the
3261.26,3263.98, Converse of that in the fear is that it will be like a
3264.3,3270.5," Flop in general, it just it doesn't matter no time at all is gonna save it, but if I mean on the positive side"
3270.5,3272.66," You give it time like everything, you know, Darren was saying"
3273.22,3279.7, Xbox live didn't amount to much right off the bat and then you had you get the snowball effect where you have to each cue join and
3280.1,3285.62, And that's no small potatoes. I mean if teach cue. I mean we've repeatedly kind of gave them props for being
3286.54,3293.38, Committed to uniquely committed to the PC platform and offering triple APC only games where other companies are
3293.38,3298.4, Tirely multiple platform. I mean it would be huge. I mean say for example if stalker
3298.6600000000003,3301.3, Supreme Commander Titan Quest and
3301.5,3305.7000000000003, Company heroes had all been games for those lives game that alone right there is
3306.78,3312.98," Should be you know compel other people to say hey, let's check this out. I will go ahead and say right now that if they put Titan Quest"
3313.62,3320.62, On games for windows live I will and have achievements. I admit I'll play it again to get the achievements from that game. Okay
3320.62,3327.58, And I will because I love that game and if they give me and another excuse to play it which is what that would be
3327.9,3332.7," Okay, well, I've beat it twice this way, but now I can try all these other things. They want me to try right"
3332.7,3336.14, You know what game they need on there? No world of warcraft
3336.9,3344.58," Yeah, over all our dead bodies, but that's the exact example of a game that will probably never be on it"
3344.58,3348.1, Don't you think I would blizzard ever need to do that's the number one
3348.1,3352.18, I could never ever imagine Blizzard on and then and these are words that we could all eat
3352.18,3353.54, But of course sure
3353.54,3359.46," It and valve I mean good god. Can you imagine after steam and everything right those there like oh, you know what yeah"
3359.62,3366.02, It was kind of we're just digging around all these years like let's let's write this those are two big companies that you would think would just look at that
3366.02,3371.9, Initiative and go yeah right like we're gonna do that like they because they don't need my but maybe that's fine
3371.9,3374.86, As long as games when there's like gets enough big stuff
3374.86,3377.34, That's fine. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing prospect
3377.34,3381.56," And I think we're used to looking at that way because that all it is on Xbox, you know, it's like great"
3381.56,3385.02," You really have no choice so actually you get it, but you could have you know"
3385.02,3387.5, I mean what if there was a service like we all play you know
3387.5,3393.58, What if I don't know it'd be like if steam suddenly started charging it was something really small like what if it was like a dollar a month or something
3393.58,3395.6600000000003," You know, I think a lot of people would be like okay"
3395.6600000000003,3400.6200000000003, We've all been trained to appreciate what steam has to offer us you know and all the important games
3400.62,3407.02, We play on it like no big deal and then you would also still you would still be playing like you know unreal and everything else too
3407.02,3412.98, I mean I think there's just room for heterogene in on this platform how about all the pop cap games on
3413.58,3416.14, Games for those live that would be handled and
3417.14,3423.18, When I was there guard that pop cap when I did talk to them about about about you know games when there's live
3423.42,3424.46, The same
3424.46,3427.42, Really enthusiastic about it and in the same way. I mean
3427.66,3431.82, The chiefs through this game's distribution being able to play them easily online with people
3431.82,3436.26, Right like all their games are available on all these different platforms PC console cell phones
3436.26,3441.2," Yeah, so if you if you follow that whole live anywhere initiative being able to like pay once for peggle and"
3441.2,3445.94, That being able to play it on any system on anything you got right back up back to the initial
3446.78,3451.38, Vision that Bill Gates shared it right three back then when it all seemed like a great idea
3451.38,3455.5," Right, I mean now that we're seeing some of it not in actually an execution"
3455.5,3459.5, But now the details are dribbling out all sorts of skepticism is coming in
3459.5,3466.38, But when Bill Gates had that big presentation where he was showing exactly what you're describing Darren where a game is
3466.5,3470.7000000000003, Existing on a cell phone and your computer and your laptop and your Xbox
3471.2200000000003,3476.58, Then suddenly it does seem pretty cool. It's something else. I also asked
3477.3,3480.86, JJ and Peter and the interview just about cross platform play
3481.38,3483.78," Beyond shadow run, which is just you know"
3484.58,3489.46," Okay, basically play the same game and play it with just different interface or the same interface if you want"
3489.46,3490.82, It's different platforms
3490.82,3498.5, But beyond that into the realm where you get like I mean you remember back when when the rumors about what the next halo would look like and some people were like you know
3498.5,3500.02, There's gonna be
3500.02,3503.98, PC people playing from RTS perspective and the console
3503.98,3508.7000000000003," You don't even get me started to do so, but I mean those sorts of things could I don't know that yeah"
3508.7000000000003,3510.7000000000003, That seems like it requires like
3510.8599999999997,3517.18, It to be a success first and then people to latch on to that aspect or do something like that and make it a success
3517.18,3521.2599999999998, And that's what the skepticism was because it's like ensemble. Okay. They're making a console game now
3521.74,3527.4199999999996," The implication I mean the implications are that yeah, it's gonna be PC 2 but without anyone really saying and"
3528.7,3533.8599999999997," I mean that that's in Darren that's in the interview. You know, you can keep you can read between the lines and guess at it"
3533.8599999999997,3537.7799999999997, But like I mean that stuff's not reassuring. It's like fastest being closed
3538.7400000000002,3543.3," As far as we know, I mean I don't understand I dance right I got wasn't clear"
3543.3,3546.5800000000004, But everything else I hear online and from fast-boss with website
3546.7400000000002,3550.5," Yes, that they're being shut down and then so those sorts of things like okay"
3550.5,3552.26, Well those aren't as a big killer
3552.26,3557.7000000000003," You know, where's the killer app gonna come from that pulls everyone to it because again when they when they truck out halo to"
3557.86,3562.7200000000003, Shadowrun and who know we're just like it is easy to say it. Why aren't wow?
3562.7200000000003,3564.7200000000003, You know you know you know people
3565.2799999999997,3570.3599999999997, Frontlines fuel a war if they if they put that in the for live support that would be it would be a really cool one
3570.3599999999997,3571.8399999999997," Yeah, but you know"
3571.8399999999997,3576.04, But just going back to what you're talking about for a second with this cross platform playing and stuff with
3576.9599999999996,3579.4399999999996, Two different types of gameplay styles and it happens right now
3579.4399999999996,3585.48, I mean there's a game called savage battle for newer it's free right now the sequel's being worked on and you have a game where basically
3585.48,3588.12, One one one person's the RTS commander
3588.12,3593.92, Tating what's going on other people playing from a first person perspective and that happens right now on a PC
3593.92,3597.8399999999997, They figured that out in the mod the source mod iron grip it didn't turn out too well
3597.8399999999997,3599.72, But it's basically the same thing for when players
3599.72,3604.52, But I'm like it was such a no-brainer thing what you know making halo wars on the PC and they command people in halo
3604.52,3607.64, Three multiplayer or some kind of thing like that how tough would that amount of figure out?
3608.2,3609.96, I'm sure it'd be tough
3609.96,3611.08, Exactly
3611.08,3612.44, I want to find a lot of time
3612.44,3616.92, I did last weekend but it's but I think as hard as you're a piece of a graph paper
3617.48,3621.16, But the thing is is if you did do it you'd make a big statement about how
3622.76,3628.4," Sort of committed to the project you are some projects success you are yeah, you say we don't we all this stuff in here"
3628.4,3634.76, You know we didn't just do some quick game that happens to work fine in either direction and it really just take one really cool thing
3634.76,3638.04, Exactly one hundred equal application. I show off what you can do with the technology
3638.04,3641.4, I got this in the top of the board. It's like what if they announce
3642.04,3644.04, Crisis or something
3644.04,3645.7200000000003, Let's do I mean I wish they would
3646.68,3649.9599999999996, And then then we'll flip and be like God damn it. I don't want to pay four months of buck
3650.3599999999997,3654.06, I got to get out of here. That was bad. I'll just down I get to get out of here. Oh
3655.56,3658.3599999999997, But yeah four four four months of buck for that
3659.72,3661.72, So yeah
3662.7599999999998,3664.7599999999998," Oh, yeah, so yeah"
3665.0,3669.3199999999997," So there's plenty more to say about it, but there is there's not much time to say much about it"
3669.3199999999997,3672.6," Right, it's to say stuff about it and we still have a heroes of the web, don't we?"
3673.24,3674.04, God
3674.12,3677.24, I couldn't even read this to you in my norm boys before the podcast
3679.24,3681.88, Shibberish so okay real quick
3682.84,3687.4, This is gonna be horrible because this is nearly impossible to read like in any state of mind with any voice
3687.48,3693.24, They come as from our our very own anime boards which can be found on the one-up forums. Oh boy
3693.24,3695.48, And I thread about everyone's favorite
3696.12,3699.08, Nerudo so echo poms says
3699.88,3704.08," Well, we're thinking if Nerudo can make"
3705.08,3710.84, 99 coins 90 could make 500 that could train with Kourinite for gengeotsu's
3711.72,3715.4, 500 a train with your model for water in earth based jutsu's
3716.12,3721.08, 501 train with guy and rock leaf or Taijitsu and how did the feet share again?
3721.08,3728.04, Whatever's left. You train to be more efficient with wind elements jutsu's as well as our newer wind element jutsu's
3729.16,3736.44, They like two weeks we could definitely be more powerful with the fourth hookon jay because that would be like 14 days with
3737.0,3742.12, Times 500 Nerudo's and that's like 19 years of training with gengeotsu to jutsu
3742.12,3745.56, Wind element trying to be a charring in earth jutsu's and water jutsu's
3746.7599999999998,3748.7599999999998, Holy crap teach me contribution
3749.96,3755.08, I need to study for a bunch of certifications and exams. He would definitely be exhausted in your model
3755.16,3759.4, And have to be honest those to stop the nine tails but that would be freaking awesome
3760.2,3762.2, I think I may talk go bell for dinner
3763.96,3768.36," Okay, so what is this about so it's about Nerudo? I don't know"
3769.24,3772.68," Explain that to the shakes. That's what okay, so sushi voices"
3773.4,3778.36, You know I had a bunch of reps to pre-must night good eats. Does anyone have the stick to kitos yet?
3779.7999999999997,3784.44, So echo poms is actually this is the longest game thread I've ever been in her scene
3785.08,3787.96, then master grunt 44 says we are awesome
3790.04,3792.2799999999997, Because it's like a 200 page thread
3792.92,3798.92, But 200 page yeah two pages so he's right when this isn't the starter one when he says this is the longest non game thread
3798.92,3802.44, He's ever been here seeing I think it's the longest non game thread. I've ever been in her scene
3803.0,3806.7599999999998, But just the fact that like master breaks it down so eloquently
3807.72,3810.36, We are awesome. We are awesome. I think math might be a little off
3812.36,3813.56, Yeah
3813.56,3819.7999999999997, But that's a that's a freaking trap for whoever's I don't know that sounds like a siff was a flick did brain
3821.7999999999997,3823.7999999999997," No, not the past judgment"
3823.7999999999997,3825.7999999999997, How can they not be holding it?
3826.36,3828.52, I want to run through babble fish and see what the hell comes out
3829.08,3830.6, Yeah
3830.6,3835.0," Yeah, so this looks like you could just type random words there be contributing to that thread"
3835.7999999999997,3837.32, I think you can go in
3837.32,3841.64," Go in and try I'll try it. Oh, oh, just three and it's wonderful to know that you're in Nerudo fan too"
3842.12,3846.44, I never knew so he knew so much about the series. It's you I love chelopas
3850.6,3852.6, In the monkeys
3852.6,3855.8799999999997, Use like a Taco Bell like comment for all your punctuation
3857.64,3859.64, Speaking of Barnes okay
3860.92,3863.7999999999997, Did you still have died? I am still on inside
3863.7999999999997,3865.7999999999997, I don't know what I just just dropped
3866.1200000000003,3869.48," I don't know what it's like. It's come from one source. Yeah, I'm sorry"
3870.6800000000003,3872.84, There did their their hot news story is the
3873.88,3875.88, Pilford files
3875.88,3882.1200000000003," You know I haven't heard any official comments. Okay, so a little bit of news broke over the over the weekend"
3882.44,3884.44, Last year yeah
3884.84,3886.84, punctuating the same so apparently
3887.48,3892.52, If some industrious people online where we're seeing that stalker shares some similar assets
3893.0,3896.36, With both doom three and with half life two
3896.92,3902.12, So they checked out if you if you like apparently some of the files looked similar but also had the same names
3902.68,3905.8, They modified the extensions like they'd add something exactly so
3906.44,3912.36, I mean there's no comment from THQ right now and actually I also know the one of it guys over at GFC internally
3912.36,3916.92, So I actually emailed him directly and actually they have off for a long Easter weekend
3916.92,3920.7599999999998, So we haven't heard so we don't know anything so we have no idea what's going on just yet
3921.7200000000003,3927.1600000000003, But when comparing the the maps that is like some water maps and like like right watered like exactly
3927.88,3931.0, It seems so like in this day and age like to think you can get away with that kind of thing
3931.0,3935.32, I can't imagine that being for real maybe they took it as a reference at one point it could be yeah
3935.32,3938.84, I don't know I don't know how clean how clean their cleanup processes
3938.84,3943.88, Maybe they were just using them internally just to play around with the next I mean it's actually if it's actually in the source files
3943.88,3947.0," I mean that's well, this will have to be a to be continued"
3947.0,3950.28, It's definitely a two-week continuous story because I'm basically just waiting to hear back from these guys now
3950.84,3954.76, I borrow lots of assets from my writing usually from gamespot
3955.96,3960.6800000000003," You know really yeah, I'll read their reviews I'll go ahead that sounds like about what I was gonna say"
3960.6800000000003,3964.0400000000004, So I'll just you know do the all control C control V into my articles
3965.32,3967.32, Is that not I'm not supposed to do it
3968.6800000000003,3975.2400000000002, A couple words here with our stories I like putting on like hands on scoops and stick around and things makes making those deadlines easier
3975.8,3978.92, I wonder if those are great great are the control
3979.4,3984.2000000000003," Exactly, you do a little switch of few words are in notice it might be like you know what they"
3984.2000000000003,3988.28, That's fine. We used to turn metallic as songs in the midi files so for doom
3988.28,3990.28, So that's a really good point
3990.6,3992.6," Yeah, they might not get"
3992.6,3997.2400000000002," You never know okay, well, we will actually we will need to revisit that story because it's kind of big"
3997.8,3999.8, It's definitely unique. It's
4000.6800000000003,4004.12, I think it's why it's proliferating so rapidly on the internet land
4004.2799999999997,4012.2799999999997, Is it a music bigs the last original song was written by Louis Armstrong in 1927
4012.7599999999998,4014.7599999999998, Bob and Dan helpful in there
4014.7599999999998,4016.7599999999998, If I did was all
4016.7599999999998,4018.7599999999998, Green
4020.7599999999998,4023.96, See what I did there about a full circle and we out about now
4027.24,4029.24, We out
4030.04,4031.24, Yeah
