26.54,33.519999999999996, Actually we're dismissing one and let's see if the reads can guess who it is when the rest introduce themselves
34.42,39.34," This is Ryan Scott, Dary Gladstone and Sean Maloy have you figured it out yet?"
40.06,42.06, Sonally it on vacation

59.9,64.1, So no heroes of the web this week so those of you that's the only reason for listening
64.1,65.9, I guess you can turn it off now
65.9,68.22, If you do you're gonna make me cry
68.62,70.86, Don't make Jeff cry don't make me cry it's sad
71.42,75.62, Also one other point of fact we are recording in the fabulous
76.3,78.3, One up or closet this week
79.1,84.3," Trapped in the one up closet. So we saw a little hollow. Yeah, yeah, literally in a closet"
84.3,88.62, What is this room like six by six or something this thing is like crazy small?
89.06,91.06, Get Ryan where's your hand?
91.06,92.06, you
92.06,93.06, eh
93.06,95.53999999999999," okay, so we have we also"
95.53999999999999,98.66, We're shipping the magazine this week so part in our
99.42,106.17999999999999," All right, if we have a reduced time this month, but everyone's in a while we do have to actually work around here today being one of those days"
107.66,109.66, So shall we get into it gang?
110.34,113.25999999999999, Sure throw down people throw down though
114.94,121.58," Oh, wow, thank you. I guess yeah, you will be in charge of the belching now that Sean is at the so well-ventilated room as well"
121.58,129.46," Yeah, yeah, I'm just keeping my gashes missed to my mouth. Yeah, please. It's a small room. Question mark. Yeah"
130.46,133.66," So okay, we had a rather big"
134.22,136.22, national event yesterday
137.1,139.1, that
139.1,143.94, Obviously not remotely a source of humor whatsoever and we just want to go into it
144.3,146.3, a little bit
146.3,148.3, only because
148.3,153.26000000000002," I don't know about you guys, but I know for sure for me within five minutes of this"
154.78,162.10000000000002, horrific event that happened at Virginia Tech I was thinking when is when's it gonna happen when and when are we gonna get that first?
163.5,165.5, You know link to video games and
166.26000000000002,170.66000000000003," I think we're all we all kind of had that same thought yesterday, right? I don't know probably everybody in the gaming industry"
170.74,177.06, We all sort of just now wait for the other shoe to drop when it's especially when it's something involving school because then it means it could be
177.7,178.66, You know
178.66,183.62, student in a young man or whatever a boy and so we're thinking great ones a link coming
186.5,188.26, In fact now we are
188.26,194.42, 24 hours after the event and there has been no link made whatsoever at this point
195.38,197.78, at all we don't even know if this guy had a computer
198.74,201.22, At this point however that has not stopped
202.18,208.82, The usual suspects from coming out and then and one unusual suspect and you know you think he's unusual well
208.82,211.54, I mean he hasn't mouth-toff about this stuff before you're right
212.26,218.14, One we're not even gonna talk about but the the one who we weren't sure is is who Darren you take that one
218.14,220.62, Dr. Phil who really needs to shut the hell up and
221.86,225.46," He needed to shut the hell up before this yeah, but this makes it official. Yeah, yeah"
225.78,231.78," So I mean, do we just like dive in I mean sure so basically he was on was it"
233.22,237.54000000000002, Mr. King last night's show on CNN and he was mouthing off about how
238.10000000000002,240.10000000000002, Games are kind of leading to the end of the world
241.06,244.18," A couple choice highlights. I don't know if you guys grabbed a couple on your own, but"
244.82,246.18, Let me see
246.18,250.5, You cannot tell me comment since tells you that if these kids are playing video games
250.9,254.58, Where they're on a mass killing spree in a video game. It's glamorized on the big screen
254.58,256.58, It's become a part of the fiber of our society
256.82,262.5, You take that and mix it in with a psychopath associated with a someone suffering from mental illness and edited dose of rage the
262.5,264.5, Suggestibility is too high and
265.06,267.06, I have the same the one thing I could think of is you know
267.06,268.98," Okay, you know Charles men some blame the the"
269.38,271.94, The monkeys or the Beatles or what?
271.94,273.54, I mean the be yeah
273.54,274.98, The Beatles the way I'm on the use
274.98,276.98," Codder crimes against him. No, I"
277.22,282.82," No, I was thinking of the Sam can I was thinking of the Sam can I was thinking of the Sam can I's in joke was like you get the same message from the freaking monkeys"
283.38,285.78000000000003, It is like you know daydream believe or how clear does it have to be
286.66,292.5, But I think the key and Dr. Dr. Phil's own words is the sociopaths and psychopaths
292.90000000000003,295.06, Like that being the like starter here
295.3,301.06," Yeah, exactly that's the common ingredient right of these mass murder types is their sociopaths"
301.38,303.46000000000004, Not that they have any like you know
303.53999999999996,305.53999999999996, particular
305.53999999999996,306.9, You know
306.9,310.9," Shared past time together, but well, maybe along with buying handguns"
311.29999999999995,313.29999999999995, I mean another shared past time
313.46,318.09999999999997, Kind of getting overloaded even straight to the video game without any bases whatsoever
318.09999999999997,320.26, It was just like heard about school shooting
320.9,322.41999999999996, Video games are to blame somehow
322.41999999999996,328.34," Right, I know anything about this guy you did yeah, I think that's that's the point at which we can express our"
328.9,333.14, Anions and our disappointment. I mean you don't need any further proof here
333.53999999999996,339.78, With this with the statement from Dr. Phil that a certain segment of society is just going to on a totally
341.06,343.06, Just knee jerk level
343.62,349.21999999999997, Blame video games for anything no matter what there's nothing to ties this thing together
349.21999999999997,354.58, And you know maybe we're gonna find out in a couple days whatever that this guy was a gamer who knows
354.58,356.5, We don't know and nobody knows anything about him
356.5,361.21999999999997, But for this to be coming out of the mouths of people right now to directly blame video games
361.86,364.66, With nothing it's just you know
365.78000000000003,367.46000000000004, What more needs to be said really?
367.46000000000004,371.82000000000005," Well, we've heard that he played basketball or something right right now that they found that I want to pass"
372.54,374.54, Right
374.54,376.54," Yeah, you know what I can I'm creating a writing"
377.54,382.14000000000004," down creative writing classes source of evil, but you know actually I have a theory as well"
382.54,387.82000000000005, Milk you know every every every kind of death rally drinks milk so it looks gonna be the cause of
388.46000000000004,390.46000000000004, Right mass mass murders
390.97999999999996,395.5, You know we're not we're not trying to be flip-a-parent and like I said at the beginning obviously
395.82,399.09999999999997, There's no humor in this in this incident at all
400.29999999999995,406.53999999999996," And again, maybe we will find out there you know that he played but you know if he did play"
407.74,409.41999999999996, so do like
409.41999999999996,417.02, How many tens of millions of kids and adults around the country and most of them don't actually commit acts of real violence
417.5,420.14, So I even feel bad that this whole event has to
420.58,422.18, We're sitting here and even talking about it
423.18,427.02, We should say that before we came on here we we debated even bringing it up
427.02,430.85999999999996," I mean, it's it's tragic and there's and it's just wrong to you know dress it up any other way"
430.85999999999996,432.85999999999996, But it's becoming a political hack tool
433.41999999999996,437.82, Everything does I know but it just it just it just it just annoys me that like people talk about the real issues
437.82,444.14, They just kind of have their own agenda to push right it is really kind of sad and ridiculous that on a gaming podcast
444.14,446.14, We're even bringing it up
446.53999999999996,451.5, So I actually do apologize to any reader who's listening to this and saying why the hell do you bring it up then?
452.46,457.5," That is a valid question, but we're addressing it only because you know we had a very"
459.41999999999996,462.7, Well known I don't know why he's well known or respected
463.74,470.86, But TV pundit mr. Dr. Phil come out on national TV and make this kind of bogus claim and I think
471.58000000000004,478.06," As stupid and wrong handed as it is you know, we we as gamers and as gaming press"
478.06,480.46000000000004, still have to look at it and figure out a way of
482.62,484.62, Addressing these things you know
486.22,490.14, I'm more in the difficult position any gamers in the difficult decision of defending themselves
490.86,496.02000000000004, Because if you're playing games and you don't it says if to the people who don't you don't your opinion doesn't matter
496.02000000000004,498.02000000000004, It's like while you're one of them
498.18,501.94, Of course you're gonna defend it right right. That's that's a struggle
502.74,508.5," Anyway, let's move on to some well let's move on to happier things we just wanted to put that out there and of course"
508.5,513.62, We are all as horrified as the rest of the country about this event and
514.74,518.1, You know our hearts go out to everybody involved so
519.46,526.02," Okay, so back into the happier land of of gaming like can we recover from this or"
526.74,529.46, We just I'll stop talking in crying now
531.38,535.9399999999999, What happened this week that was good news we had at least one good thing you were to a couple good things that happened
537.46,540.34," But we'll we'll call the a fallout thing good news, right?"
541.78,544.5, I think so I mean seeing any new fallout game is gonna be a good news
545.54,550.1," So what it what happened there Darren what was the news? Well, I mean like it's never been a secret"
550.1,554.98, I mean like right but but this has been talking you know teasing us that they have the fallout franchise
555.0600000000001,562.58, Or at least they acquiring it but it was only made official last week. I think that they have all IP ownership for 5.75 million bucks
563.3000000000001,564.34, So
564.34,566.58, That's steel a bargain. It's twice the price
567.22,567.94, So
568.1800000000001,573.78, They finished shivering aisles and now they're kind of rolling in big time on focusing on the next game which is looks like fallout
574.34,576.9, Is that it's that's a lot of freaking money
577.54,581.0600000000001, 5.7 million dollars like I said you know it gives him rights the old games
581.0600000000001,583.38, I guess maybe they can maybe repackage him if they wanted to
583.9399999999999,584.98, That's it
584.98,587.7," I don't know I don't know they have a deal works, but"
589.7,594.82, But the one thing I guess the one thing it's been I've been just wondering about as I mean you guys can correct me on this if I'm wrong
594.82,600.02," Okay, so the the Elder Scrolls games are quite a large pretty serious stuff right it's like high fantasy"
600.66,601.86, I guess
601.86,606.66, They have some goofy humor some people know the whole no expansion is kind of based on
607.62,612.26," Craziness I haven't played I haven't played chamber giles yet. You like it or I haven't played it, but that's"
612.74,614.74, All right
614.74,617.22, That's the theme here. We are the authority
618.18,623.78," No, but so anyway I guess what I was wondering is can they pull off the snark I mean because personally when I was playing the fallout series"
623.78,629.22, I love that snarkiness and kind of like that tongue and g-cumer and right modern cultural nuts and
629.38,631.9399999999999, I'm wondering would they be able to pull it off as well?
631.9399999999999,635.54, I mean like because they're talking about taking the IP in a hole and it look they're take on it
636.66,640.5," Yeah, well, I mean my big concern would be would be"
641.22,644.26, The fact that fallout was you know an isometric
645.14,646.34, Turn-based game
646.34,650.42, Which which is like a totally different style of game than anything
650.98,654.42, But that's just done with with their role-playing games so
655.14,660.02, As opposed to as a post is as opposed to like the humor or something which you know all they have to do is hire
660.26,663.54, a good writer writers who are like a minimal to that style of humor
663.94,666.5," That's yeah, that's I don't think that's gonna be an issue the right"
666.58,670.98," I mean I've seen a bunch of games jump you know genres, but I mean it's just a matter"
670.98,674.82, I mean to me I think the game the heart and soul the game was turn-based strategy of course
674.82,678.02, I would be surprised if they don't turn it into something like a blivom
678.5,680.5, Like you think it's absolutely
680.82,686.18," There's no way it's gonna be a turn-based RPG. I can't even see it. Oh, yeah, you guys think it's gonna be like a first person"
686.18,688.98," I can't imagine it. Yeah, I mean like gonna be interesting"
689.3,693.14," I didn't even I just haven't even given them a lot of thought, but yeah, I guess you could be right maybe I'm wrong"
693.14,694.5, I don't know I could be like a doctor
694.58,699.86," Just assume yeah, I would just assume yeah, yeah, it's gonna be a blivom, but we post a"
699.86,704.2, Poclectic so which you know basically like stalker kind of that's a
704.82,706.82," shooter I mean well, I mean"
707.54,711.54, It was a shooter with RPG leading is supposed to get away around the RPG
711.54,717.54, I think this will still be an RPG. I think it'll I would be surprised if they just didn't take
717.54,720.02, About the blivom template wholesale almost
720.26,726.02, I mean a couple tweaks here because I mean they're doing it. They've been with us. Are they doing it in house?
726.02,731.22," Is that what we know? So it's their next in house. That's yeah, because I mean the ex-"
731.78,734.18, They're working with the zombie to do that rogue warrior game
735.46,742.8199999999999," Yeah, editor director John Davidson just walked by the window and is that sticking his tongue out at us as we podcast life. Thanks John"
743.38,744.98, You know I should bring it camera next time
745.38,747.38, Capture some of these like codec moments
748.02,750.02, We're gonna have to get him back on one of yours now
752.58,758.98," Yeah, I don't know this this game it makes me nervous a little but I'm coming from a slightly gizzery perspective of"
759.3,762.18, That I loved file at one file to a little awesome
764.18,766.18, I like file tactics. I'm not that
766.98,771.3, crappy action RPG. Oh that wasn't that was like a balder's gate rip off on the consoles
771.3,775.62," What's that called? Can I remember was it a file a game? Yeah, it was a file I mess it was fall out branded"
775.7,777.7, But it was totally cheesoid. I
778.18,783.0600000000001," Yeah, I have a vague memory of this, but I think I blocked it from my consciousness when I came out"
783.0600000000001,785.54, That's good calls. I got a scorpion Sean will love it
786.18,791.62," Yeah, but I don't want to have to block file three from my consciousness. I don't want them to screw it up. I have a memory"
791.78,793.38, I have every faith in them
793.38,801.14," Well, they make good games. They make a games and I this franchise is gonna be totally new for them. Right. All right. They always do the fantasy thing"
801.94,804.66, They did the um did they do the call of kulfi-lifing in house
805.86,807.86, Dead
807.86,809.54," Wait, remember that one? No, I don't know no"
810.42,814.18, I don't know if it was about in house. We don't know shit. All right. We are totally
814.98,816.98, The authority. Yeah
818.42,821.22, We're shipping a magazine today. We don't have time to well
822.42,829.54, Nobody fat checkers here. We will but this they made our game of the year so we had every reason to believe that by a if this thing is a
830.0999999999999,834.5," I'm a fan of Bethesda and their games. It's just yeah, we're talking right"
835.78,839.14, Franchise for how they could take that for me. It just seems like a natural
839.3,842.74," progression. Yeah, Olivia is really open ended lots of side quests"
843.06,848.02, Follow up pretty open ended very true side quests right very true kind of shape your character however you want it
848.5799999999999,851.2199999999999," It's a seems yeah, I've never seen cool perks"
851.4599999999999,856.66, Filed is definitely one of those to me. It's one of the best RPGs they ever played because it was so much
856.9,861.54, You really that was one of the games where I felt like what you did really influence I mean
862.1,868.26," Right, yeah, how the game played out right and the dialogue actually mattered the choices you're attitude"
868.74,874.1, Actually mattered you know a lot of games claimed to do that but very few pulled off and that one did and you're right
874.1,875.3, Bethesda too
875.3,880.3399999999999," No, it's how to do that but there's a mistake take a the playing escape tournament series as well now all around it. Yeah"
881.06,883.78," Yeah, another thing feed. Yeah"
884.74,886.74, It's true. That was awesome
887.22,890.98," Love that series probably my favorite of the blackout. Yeah, yes"
891.6999999999999,895.62, That was one of the most skeptical about two because I was like I don't know if I want to play this
896.1,899.38, Character that's already pre-made for me and always have their own PCs
899.38,901.38," Yeah, that's true. It was awesome"
901.38,906.1, I have to admit though the only ones I ever finished as much as I liked on the blackout games was

1062.74,1065.78, Car also I'm making a big deal about the fact that
1066.42,1070.42, Open the gamers age four and older it appears like three times in the thing
1070.98,1076.26," No strollers will be allowed in big bold face that's good, but plenty of people are led to dress to kids"
1076.26,1079.78, Little ass I can't imagine where their strollers last time was that like an issue?
1080.42,1085.94, I don't know apparently it was because they put it in bold face this time. You were there. I was disgustingly packed. It was like
1087.06,1089.7, It was it was a lot of sweaty
1089.7,1093.3," Those are fans my nightmare. Yeah, and it was all lines"
1094.02,1099.54," Yeah, right and first like E3 yeah, I think they actually were calling it line con themselves"
1099.94,1103.06, Some of those are employees have very tightly focused E3 on
1103.54,1109.22," Especially the sweaty nerds just messing together. Yeah, it really was one line after another"
1109.7,1113.06, That was that was the last was gone was when I finally said hey
1113.6200000000001,1117.14, Starcraft ghosts is looking pretty cool. I was just gonna say that that's true
1117.38,1121.54," And it's a no more times where I was just like yeah, and then the time was like finally it's getting somewhere"
1121.54,1125.46," Yeah, they had stations set up where you could play Starcraft ghost and it actually was fun"
1125.6200000000001,1129.8600000000001, I've ever seen that at E3 like a two years ago
1130.18,1131.38, Probably
1131.38,1134.66, I was the last time I saw those kind of promising
1134.9,1136.9, Haven't been for a while
1137.14,1139.22, I'll just wait for Starcraft two. I guess now what's gone
1139.7,1145.3000000000002," We've shared played more there. Yeah, Starcraft two if there's a Starcraft two so so aside from like the music performances"
1145.7,1148.98, Whatever panels like what is there to really do at Lizcon
1150.5800000000002,1155.6200000000001," Me was all about the panels by the lizard product. Yeah, the panels are really the I was it talking out on those"
1155.8600000000001,1158.66," Yeah, the highlight of it because really not that much else"
1158.66,1161.38, There's last time there was like a costume contest
1161.7,1163.7, You know you know those go
1164.18,1169.78," Yeah, there was a they had Starcraft international tournaments there's like a rotational thing and I watched some of that"
1169.78,1173.06, I was actually never watched that before and I discovered I can't watch
1174.74,1176.98, That was your last time I've watched it
1178.18,1182.18, And then they had like that was the first time that was when they announced for an increase a right yep
1182.18,1185.78," Yes, yeah, they showed the trailer playing the model star and we're not issue. Oh, that's right"
1186.18,1188.18, And that was about
1188.26,1190.26, It there's the longest line was for the store
1191.22,1193.22, It very true it was
1193.22,1195.22, By hats
1195.22,1197.54," Not get this hat there, but yeah, I got other hats"
1198.26,1200.98, You should walk around what I did is walk around the with the one day
1200.98,1205.0600000000002, And then the next day did Disney land because it's and which do you like better?
1205.94,1210.66," Oh, man, few lines of Disney. There were few lines of Disney. Now there's a comment"
1211.78,1213.78," Yeah, you get down anything"
1213.86,1216.8999999999999, The developer panels were were awesome and they were
1217.54,1223.94," Awesome, I would say equally from the developer side because those guys are very forthcoming and honest"
1223.94,1228.42," Yeah, they're correct, but the the fan reaction was great too, you know, it was just"
1229.1399999999999,1231.78, Really kind of much more so than E3 which
1232.82,1238.34, Which is really supposed to just be an industry event and I mean we know a lot of civilians sneak in
1238.6599999999999,1244.4199999999998, But but really it's still mostly game industry people and then being at a fan convention where
1244.74,1249.3799999999999, Partly everything these guys said would be met with wolves and cheers and it was just kind of
1249.3799999999999,1253.22, You could kind of tell that they were just like what the what's going on?
1253.62,1257.1399999999999," Yeah, they were kind of taking it back by like every panel I went to yeah, all just kind of like"
1257.78,1258.5, Wow
1258.5,1262.4199999999998," Yeah, they were kind of blown away by their own celebrity like they didn't realize"
1263.1399999999999,1266.1799999999998," You know, I mean they know from meeting message boards or whatever"
1266.74,1272.98," You know that they had obviously they have a lot of fans, but it was like the personal the public appearance and"
1273.46,1276.66," Seeing thousands of people was like holy crap, you know"
1277.94,1282.26," Which you know, that was kind of how it is for us in public too, you know"
1283.22,1288.26," People stop you on the street all it's all the time. Yeah, yeah"
1288.98,1291.6200000000001, The price of celebrity. That's kind of a burden
1292.18,1294.18, Are you Tom Green
1295.14,1298.5800000000002, So I'm gonna go I'm your biggest fan. I'm I'm going to blow for sure
1299.38,1303.54, Plus you get like good stuff. That's remember there's there is the goody bag
1304.5800000000002,1310.18," Which you know probably has gonna have some turtle mountains they got to do some in game now, right?"
1310.18,1312.5," Don't you think yeah, that would be disappointed if they don't"
1312.74,1315.8600000000001, So you guys go to that the girl locks the Murlocs
1316.5,1318.66, Comic Con you know that you do that. I'll go to come

1330.3400000000001,1333.7," I'm think Ryan you've ever missed a Comic Con, have you? I've been to one"
1334.26,1339.54, I want to one for one day. Wow. Wow. The staff's a bunch of posters. I think I'd have

1343.7,1345.7, Yeah
1345.7,1347.7, The guy who eats more comedy for many better
1349.0600000000002,1354.02, I think the highlight of Comic Con for me was walking by hairy noils engage in a green lantern discussion
1354.18,1357.8600000000001, Did you punch him in the for really how the hell is hairy noils a highlight for you
1358.5,1360.26, I thought you were gonna say it was in a green lantern
1360.26,1362.26," Oh, oh, it was without a minute you better"
1362.98,1365.54," I was like hey, that's hairy noils. Hey, he's talking about green lantern"
1365.6200000000001,1370.26, So did you actually have this moment of did you tell him he's like the worst writer on the entire internet?
1370.26,1375.3, Come on now. I stayed for a moment like he could see hairy noils in the wild
1376.5800000000002,1382.42," Did you have this moment of celebrity like hey, it's hairy noils? Oh, you can admit it. Did you have this like"
1382.98,1385.7," I think I said hey, it's hairy noils. Okay, I got it"
1387.38,1391.54, You know I don't I might I'm just thinking I might and then you watch a really gravy stuff
1391.54,1393.54, Just a little bit of a tushy celebrity
1394.5,1396.5, Sorta
1397.14,1400.5," Yeah, Ryan is just you know like the hairy noils"
1401.7,1403.38, I will
1403.38,1408.1000000000001," Be quiet now almost as much as I suppose I don't normal M. Oh, I don't really care for me"
1408.1,1412.5," They're just like hey, it's hairy noils right? It was the only celebrity I saw the whole time"
1412.5,1415.3799999999999, So it was kind of quote-unquote
1415.62,1417.06," Yeah, I never saw anybody a comment"
1417.06,1420.1, Except the panels I think there's an expert panel and like they had the cast up there
1421.3799999999999,1426.1799999999998, Brian Singer and you didn't cut in I saw lots of guys in like spider men outfits
1426.1799999999998,1427.78, But I don't take any of them were actually
1428.6599999999999,1430.02, Spider men
1430.02,1434.5, You ask any of them are you the real spider man? Can you pull it for a picture with me?
1434.74,1435.78, Yeah
1435.78,1440.42, The best thing about like comic-con like those kinds of kinds of conventions is like just going by the um
1440.98,1442.98, Like the deal with celebrity tables
1442.98,1445.94," Oh, yeah, oh, so I'm seeing all the hazards"
1445.94,1452.98, My favorite go to wondercon and seeing like like see get an autograph with with pro wrestler Virgil and like
1453.3,1458.18, The loneliness table in the in the whole show is there like you know playing solitaire or something
1458.18,1461.62," Yeah, usually one of the quarries there of a hammer of Feldman you're right"
1462.4199999999998,1465.78," It's the courty corner. Yeah, yeah, probably contractually"
1465.78,1467.78, The guy who played Shubaka
1467.78,1469.06, Uh-huh
1469.06,1469.78, Timmy from last
1469.78,1477.1399999999999, They had one of them had one of the old Batman the Batman TV show not earth a kid but it wasn't cat woman

1481.54,1487.6999999999998, Ivan Craig really yes damn you're good. I know I know a lot about the old Batman show
1488.02,1491.38, Especially the bat women yeah
1498.42,1502.3400000000001," Yeah, and this would make a great piece of game next topic"
1504.5,1507.6200000000001, I wouldn't a great piece of game what Batman the TV show
1508.3400000000001,1511.3," Oh, I thought you're gonna say like Comic-Con type food or something"
1511.3,1513.3, Oh
1513.3,1515.3," Just there's already somebody work out that yeah, no doubt"
1516.4199999999998,1520.4199999999998, There's probably never been a good Batman PC game has there that sucks
1521.22,1523.22," Wait, is there been a good Batman console game?"
1523.78,1526.8999999999999, There were a couple back in like the Nintendo Super Nintendo era
1526.8999999999999,1530.1," Oh, I know you think it was a song time something with those this Sin the Sue"
1530.5,1537.3799999999999, That was nobody ever did anything with the whole wasn't that great Batman franchise I mean that came back Batman and Superman both
1538.1000000000001,1543.94," Have been the first terrible game franchises. Yeah, maybe DC Superheroes just don't make for good"
1544.66,1546.66, video game characters
1546.66,1550.18, Not so far. Could that be cuz Marvel's doing all right?
1550.66,1552.66," Yeah, it's better man was a success"
1553.0600000000002,1556.5," All right, so what what has there been a good DC comic game ever?"
1557.22,1562.3400000000001, There were a couple of good Batman games. There was adventures of Batman and Robin on the Super Nintendo
1562.98,1564.98," Wow, so we're going to go way back"
1565.54,1569.14, What what and I remember liking the Batman movie Genesis game
1569.54,1571.46, I don't know if it was good though. It is more believe
1572.74,1575.14," Let me see what else how about it? I mean, I don't know this pathetic"
1575.8600000000001,1580.22, I could they're not be a good bat and then and then switch the great character ever superman as even worse
1580.82,1583.7, Superman I could see not being good. What do you do with Superman?
1583.7,1586.9," It was too powerful. You know, I think it's like like the actually the last game"
1586.9,1590.74, I tried superman returns. They had an interesting idea making the city alive. All right the city
1591.06,1593.06, With the one the god that I'll play else
1594.26,1596.26," Yeah, it's exactly"
1596.82,1598.9," No, but it's you know it was just it was a poorly executed"
1599.14,1604.66, Because it's a good idea poorly executed you get seems like you could have a really good Batman. I don't know like a third person
1605.86,1608.5, Rpg shooter sort of on Rpg maybe not
1609.22,1612.74," Batman or action RPG. Yeah, something well they did that like Justice League"
1614.1,1619.7," Yeah, yeah, but the whole got the look of Gotham City just seems like it can make it for a great environment"

1769.74,1775.74, Marathon for free which is amazing that got the whole marathon bungee as the whole marathon series up there for free
1776.3,1778.46, And
1778.46,1785.3," Plank through marathon one and of course, you know, it was like playing doom one on the on Xbox live arcade a little while ago"
1785.3,1787.3, It's like obviously the
1787.7,1792.14, Data beyond belief in terms of both graphics and certain elements of gameplay
1792.5,1799.34, But you know level design holds up over time over decades even and and so to story and
1799.98,1804.06, Marathon just completely has it and I'm loving it all over again
1804.06,1810.86, And I really feel like it's not you know just rose colored in out not just me living in the past
1810.86,1814.8999999999999, Like it actually feels like a good game still so I definitely encourage people to go check it out
1814.8999999999999,1819.26, I could swear people like recreated some of the marathon maps in like you know
1819.34,1825.74, Doom three and stuff like that I think there have been conversions and maps like that done yeah
1827.1,1832.34, But reading on message boards about the reaction to the to the retranads podcast
1832.86,1837.22, You know definitely you're definitely finding people saying like I didn't know bungee did anything before halo
1837.22,1838.8999999999999, You know just kind of like yeah
1838.8999999999999,1841.8999999999999, I didn't know Pama Cartony had a group before wings because
1842.58,1845.82, It's like marathon was huge and great at the time
1845.82,1851.78, Marathon obviously was in nowhere in Halo's league in terms of popularity but still myth myth as well
1851.78,1855.74, That was a great stretch. I think it was at one of the first tactical series that really got into
1856.4199999999998,1862.26," Yeah, it was one of the first like real time 3D 3D I think it was was the first"
1862.34,1868.54, I could be wrong and we'll hear it if I am but I'm I'm fairly certain they were the first ones that had like a 3D map
1869.26,1873.1399999999999, or 3D terrain in an RTS and it was also totally
1873.54,1875.54, Tactic based right there was no
1876.82,1880.34," Yeah, there was no base base building. You kind of just got your army at the beginning"
1881.02,1885.78, Off you go. Oh god. That was a great series that you guys like Oney
1886.34,1889.3799999999999, I like the Oney better than some of the
1889.38,1891.22, I replaced it about a level of Oney
1891.7800000000002,1895.6200000000001, I was like maybe I'll play this again some day. It just totally did nothing for me
1896.6200000000001,1901.5800000000002, Did they develop that in house? I thought that wasn't them. I know I thought it was like a bunch of bars. I think
1902.18,1903.46, Or whatever it would be
1904.66,1907.38," Once again, we don't know once again. Yeah, tharts"
1908.5800000000002,1912.5," Wow, it's a theme today. We know shit and yet we're still talking"
1913.38,1915.38, We'll continue to talk
1915.38,1917.38, She have to be where we talk out of our asses
1918.18,1920.18, Literally
1920.18,1922.18," Just not in this room. Oh yeah, I"
1922.5800000000002,1924.18, And I'll put them in
1924.42,1931.7800000000002," So yeah, so I'm playing a I'm playing marathon and I'm digging it and and anyone who needs a good lesson on bungee's history"
1931.7800000000002,1934.7800000000002, You should go check it out and I wish I had that you are altatalia
1934.7800000000002,1936.7800000000002, But if you just search on bungee and
1936.98,1945.46, Marathon you'll find the link or go to our website at one-up.com and go to the Retronauts podcast page and I think that links there do that
1945.8600000000001,1949.6200000000001," But still fuck that second one. Yeah, but still fuck Regenauts here"
1950.98,1952.98, And the details playing anything fine
1954.9,1961.9," I got nothing this week really we have been busy with the whole work thing. Yeah, I've just I've snuck in some wow"
1962.1000000000001,1965.3," Believe it or not well, and that's work related right?"
1965.78,1971.22," Because you know, yeah, I've got a big wild story so in the work so I've been playing my Wii"
1971.22,1973.22, Which I finally got
1973.22,1978.74," By the way, that count sure that counts and how's it holding up pre pretty cool?"
1979.06,1983.6200000000001," Yeah, now that you bought one like after the initial like hype in excitement"
1984.42,1989.06," Your your feeling it was worth it. I think yeah, I think it's pretty cool. I'm digging the controller"
1989.38,1991.38, What do you got? Okay
1991.38,1997.06," Super super paper Mario is what I'm doing right now. It's good one. Yeah, that too. I love the first paper Mario"
1997.06,1999.7," So well, this one it's like side scrolling"
2000.3400000000001,2003.22, Really it's kind of like a hybrid platform
2003.94,2010.3," Yeah, it's kind of size falling in there are parts where it goes 3D or you go and it's using yeah controller to do shit"
2010.3,2012.3, You know the controller like on its side
2012.94,2016.02, So you're playing like a typical game path. Okay
2016.5800000000002,2023.3," It's very minimal with the weaness. Yeah, so to speak, but it's just a good game. I'm glad when they like"
2023.78,2028.98, Don't abuse the week control or just because they have it like if they're just gonna make a game that it's just kind of
2028.98,2032.74, Intrusive to like swing or I'm around I prefer if they just go with the traditional method
2033.38,2037.6200000000001, Because that's what I like Zelda the swinging around with the sorrows actually kind of dumb
2037.8600000000001,2040.98," Well, Zelle you can tell if that was like a game cube game retro faded"
2040.98,2043.14," Yeah, of course. Yeah, and it's just a really shit"
2043.46,2050.38," Okay, but let's not descend in the we talk. Oh, yeah. Hello, right here on GFW radio sorry boys, but speaking of intent"
2050.38,2053.7," Oh, no, I'm gonna watch how I bring this back. Okay, so there's a game that I've been checking out"
2053.7,2055.7, It's kind of combination of Pikmin and Gremlins
2056.26,2057.62, It's called overlord
2057.7,2061.2999999999997," No, it's okay, so we wrote about it in our in the first issue of the magazine"
2061.2999999999997,2065.8599999999997, And I've been actually really surprised that nobody's been talking about this game. It is so much fun
2066.2599999999998,2069.62, It kind of has shades of like dungeon master in there. It kind of like it
2070.42,2072.2599999999998, Who makes this game and what is it there?
2072.2599999999998,2075.7, Code masters makes it and I remember seeing it E3 like
2076.5,2082.58, Hidden away in this small little booth on the back end on one monitor and it was like no one was no one was seeing it
2082.58,2084.98," No one was checking it out, but I went over and took a look at it back then"
2085.06,2088.18," Wow, this is really cool idea. It's very comical very like"
2089.06,2095.54," Pollished fantasy, but you know obviously tongue-in-sheak. Okay, so Pikmin was a game-tube game in which you like rounded up"
2096.42,2098.42," Creatures, right?"
2098.42,2105.3, How does that so what happens in overlord overlord basically you aren't evil overlord and the game evolves depending on how evil you want to be
2105.78,2108.42, So you start off and you have you know you have a busted up
2109.3,2114.9, Castle and you have to reclaim the pieces of your evil fortress that have broken apart and are like kind of corrupt
2115.06,2119.78, The land so you go out and you find and you find Minions to go out and do your dirty work
2120.18,2123.86, I think that sounds like dungeon keeper too. So and the thing is but it's also an action game in that
2124.42,2128.34, You're overlord you can walk around it up you walk up to someone and slice them
2129.06,2133.62, But you also can just control your have your minions do everything like I would you point the cursor at some sheep
2134.34,2137.06, And you say okay go get them and they'll go kill the sheep for you
2137.54,2139.54, Why would you want to kill sheep?
2139.54,2144.5, There is there in lies that you're evil exactly so you can kill anything you can kill the towns people
2144.74,2149.54, And they'll wait I mean like if you just let them be they'll treat you like a kind of hero
2150.1,2152.74, But if you but if you send your minions to go out and loot the town
2153.06,2156.9, The little start running from you and fear you and the town evolves in that way so like basically
2157.7,2162.26, As you start claiming areas that belong to you you'll see like these big like banners pop up
2162.26,2167.62," It's like oh, Bay with bodies hanging off of them and stuff and it's very it's very twisted and so this is a retail game"
2168.02,2172.42," Well, it will be a retail game at one point. Uh-huh. It's still a ways off. I think it's coming out the summer"
2172.5,2176.58, But it's I I'm just kind I want to do my part to kind of like get the word out there about this thing
2176.58,2180.1," Okay, because you did all right mission accomplished"
2180.58,2188.02, You're part so is it in like alpha stage? I think I think it's in beta stage and while I haven't officially looked at it
2188.98,2190.98, It is it is looking really cool and
2192.5,2194.82, I think people should be on a lookout for that one
2195.2200000000003,2197.38, It's coming it's coming to the PC and the 360
2197.86,2199.38, Same simultaneous
2199.38,2203.86," But we're gonna say you should probably go ahead get it on the PC. Yeah, you know it forget the 360 word"
2204.98,2206.98, Fuck that 360 seriously
2206.98,2210.58, Fuck those guys in that fucking here. Can we say that? I just did
2211.38,2217.62," We are in partnership with Microsoft. Oh, right right that but only on the only on the game for Windows side"
2218.26,2220.26," Well, that's tested. Let's see if we hear next week"
2221.54,2224.58, Fuck the 360 right now. We'll see what happens and
2225.54,2229.7," Actually, I just wanted to pose a quick question you guys so I was kind of thinking about this last week capcom"
2229.7,2234.66," Formally announced to kind of pushing more of their console games to the to the PC as well. Yeah, right?"
2234.8199999999997,2241.54, So lost planets coming is gonna be the first one of the first DX 10 games out the door and that's gonna be in hands June 10th
2242.5,2244.5, So what I'm wondering June
2245.06,2251.34," In June not the June 10. I'm just anyway, but I saw I'm going forward. I mean like devil make cry for that's potentially PC"
2251.42,2256.6200000000003," You know, do you guys care about seeing a game like devil micry for other PC or would you just want to see it on a console?"
2256.6200000000003,2258.6200000000003, I'm just gonna hear it
2258.6200000000003,2260.6200000000003," Um, two console-ish"
2261.02,2264.7000000000003, To me would definitely depend on the game for sure. Yeah. I mean
2265.1800000000003,2269.7400000000002, You can plug in the next box three seconds you can draw later and pretty much play it. I mean without without that
2269.98,2272.46, I would say I would play it on my console no question
2273.02,2275.02," Yeah, I mean I have both"
2275.02,2277.02, I know I buy I have both
2277.02,2281.1800000000003," Right, um, and but when a game comes out that is on both at the same time"
2281.2599999999998,2285.8199999999997, Right now it still depends on the game for me which I'd rather play
2286.54,2290.54, I think I've gone both ways now and I'm trying to think of a good example of each
2291.1,2295.5, I think in this case just because it's totally because of my setup and my rig but I would play on my
2297.2599999999998,2299.2599999999998, 360 double make cry
2299.2599999999998,2304.62," You faster yeah, I think I would try to be honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I actually know what a good example for me for for both"
2304.62,2306.62, But you're talking about oblivion
2306.62,2310.3799999999997," Yeah, right there you go because of oblivion looks so beautiful on a big TV"
2310.78,2313.9," You kind of want to sit there and get immersed in the world. Okay, but I went the other way"
2313.9,2317.42, crazy and I played it on the PC because I was concerned about downloads
2318.1400000000003,2325.98," I wanted it to just be open to me to get like free shit, so all right, so I put it on the PC and also my TV sucks"
2326.46,2328.46, Plus I wanted to play it with a mouse
2328.46,2333.1," Well, actually I mean I played both but I I got further in the PC version because of all the mods that you know"
2333.1,2335.7400000000002, Kind of change the gameplay and stuff like that in the initial quest
2336.38,2339.02, Something like definitely like how you're gonna kind of be pre-disposed to
2339.5,2341.98, Buy it on a console just because I think of it as a console
2341.98,2344.7, Because you've been trained as me if you don't have a 360 then great
2345.34,2348.86," Right, I can plug in the next box or you take control and whoa it does a good question"
2348.86,2354.06, Like down the line if places if companies like capcom start making more simultaneous releases
2354.62,2359.5, Like is that anything but a good thing? I don't know like what the downside is for them even you know
2359.5,2362.38," Right, I don't know it's like another skew for them to sell copies"
2363.18,2365.02, Probably to people who wouldn't buy it otherwise
2365.2599999999998,2367.5," Well, the thing is in the past I remember they've made the you know"
2367.98,2371.02, Had publishing deals or they had kind of like passed the buck on the PC version
2371.02,2373.66, They'll say like I don't know whatever company and
2374.46,2378.94," There was a plan to release Resident Evil 4 on the PC, but that still hasn't happened"
2379.34,2383.82, So the fact we're seeing the lost planet a couple months after they console releases
2383.82,2388.3," You know kind of a good sign but again, Resident Evil 4 seems to me like one that I"
2389.18,2394.54," Be skeptical about even playing on the PC. I don't know man. I mean you enjoyed playing in Furnal on the PC, right?"
2395.02,2397.98," I did yeah, that's a very consoleish game. You're right"
2399.18,2406.7," You're right and Furnal was a little well now. It's not like Resident Evil 4. Well, just by the camera angle is yeah, but not the gameplay"
2408.86,2410.86, Yeah
2410.86,2416.54, I mean it's not like there haven't been console for its to PC in the past but psychonauts right
2417.5,2424.3," That unprecedented activity by any means. No. I mean, I think the only thing we want is but we always say it's just like you know"
2424.3,2430.22," Make the port work on the PC don't be lazy about pouring it. Oh, God"
2430.22,2435.58, I remember the spider man game the original one that was like right a kids game on the PC and then like right
2436.38,2442.14," Well, what you know when you're playing a PC version and and and then and then you know you get a thing on the screen"
2442.46,2446.2999999999997," Press the circle button now, you know, you know they haven't done right job"
2450.2999999999997,2453.02, Like there's there's two
2454.06,2460.06, Ports that I've reviewed recently J. Empire and top spin two and they both kind of like assume you're using an
2460.62,2462.2999999999997, Xbox 360 controller
2462.2999999999997,2465.74, They do it'll be like press the green a button or whatever
2466.14,2471.02," I want to set in J. Empire too, right. Yeah, and they were talking about optimizing that for keep what it mouse"
2471.02,2473.02, They still have it in there
2473.02,2480.46, It but still could that maybe that's because you have the controller plugged in like I did what happens
2480.46,2483.98, Like I didn't try this but you know what would happen if you plug in like some
2484.62,2486.46," Yeah, you know off-brand controller right"
2487.2599999999998,2490.14, But why would you by anything but a Microsoft controller?
2490.86,2494.38," Yeah, you earn a hundred each even points for using that controller"
2494.94,2496.94, You know like I've actually
2497.5,2499.2599999999998, Do you kind of do have a good point though
2500.2200000000003,2502.86, I mean like the Xbox 360 killer seriously
2507.42,2510.6200000000003," Well, you're kind of making a joke, but it's like the Xbox 360 controller"
2510.6200000000003,2517.1000000000004, I don't know that I would ever use another that actually is really good on the PC especially if games are gonna start assuming this right
2517.7400000000002,2519.7400000000002, I wouldn't either
2520.5400000000004,2522.5400000000004, Do we have anything else this week at all?
2522.5400000000004,2527.6600000000003," Actually, I wanted to get a quick shout out to one of our readers. Oh, yes, so actually this is a really cool"
2528.62,2533.1, PM I got from a sergeant B on the one up form to medieval Arctic
2533.66,2537.2599999999998," So I'm just gonna read it straight up so hello, I know you get tons of mail"
2537.2599999999998,2540.46, But I like to tell you that your podcast a bit of bright light in the murky field
2540.94,2543.98, Disgusting filth that I reside in he stationed I rag right now
2544.7,2547.66," I particularly like heroes of the web. Sorry. We don't have one this week, man"
2547.98,2551.74, But last week's song was also very nice. I usually play the podcast
2551.98,2554.54, I play the podcast usually with a as large a group as I can muster
2554.7799999999997,2556.7799999999997, Keep up the good work
2556.7799999999997,2561.9, And you know what keep thanks for spreading the good word over there and glad we can weather podcast can help out a little
2562.54,2565.18, I would have thought our podcast might make it even more depressing
2566.86,2571.58, But I would hide in your bunk or something to anyone listening out in Iraq or anywhere else
2571.58,2575.5, We're glad that we couldn't do our tiny tiny share
2576.3,2578.3, Tiny tiny tiny
2578.86,2581.74, So you send us something cool from over there and we'll send you a game
2582.7,2586.14, What could they possibly send us cool from over there and could we send them a game?
2588.22,2590.4599999999996, Never mind that whole you know it Darren was said
2593.8199999999997,2596.14," Yeah, all right, I got I got"
2599.74,2601.74, All's emperor oh
2601.74,2603.74, Oh
2603.74,2606.7, I'm back from my big trip over to Brax studios in
