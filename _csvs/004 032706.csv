0.0,5.76," Hello and welcome to the C.D.W podcast. This is Jeff Green, the editor-in-chief of Computer"
5.76,12.24, Gaming World and with me are an esteemed group of fine young gentlemen who are now
12.24,16.44, introduced themselves. Also they're all naked this week.
16.44,18.64, Sorry was that never shared?
18.64,23.28," Dress over here, Sean Elliott, previous editor for C.G.W."
23.28,27.88," And standing in today, I'm Jason Cross from the Extreme Tech and worry my Batman"
27.88,30.4," under Ruse, Daring Lads Don."
30.4,37.8, And on the engineering tip over here as usual is Mr. Scott as an alt or if you want to say
37.8,39.96, correctly as an alt.
39.96,40.96, Right?
40.96,42.32, I thought it was an S-nut.
42.32,44.32," Alright, moving on."
44.32,45.32, Sorry.
45.32,47.96, Jason Cross for those of you who don't know.
47.96,48.96," Oh, boy."
48.96,49.96, Scott's mad.
49.96,51.599999999999994, Don't piss off the engineer.
51.599999999999994,52.599999999999994, Sorry.
52.599999999999994,57.36, All of Darren's voice things now after this are going to be up to Octos.
57.92,60.88, Because he screwed with the engineer.
60.88,67.4," For those who don't know, Jason Cross is Dr. Tech Medix in CGW."
67.4,71.6," So he's guessed in here in the podcast, but actually he's a regular CGW writer."
71.6,73.6," Yeah, sort of."
73.6,74.6, Sort of.
74.6,78.16," So welcome, Dr. We are we're gathered here today."
78.16,83.8," We all just got back from the game developers conference in San Jose, which is a yearly"
83.8,87.44," gathering of game developers, oddly enough."
87.44,89.75999999999999, And the press usually crashes this show.
89.75999999999999,91.56, We did this year.
91.56,98.16," In years past, it was a little more geeky and sort of industry oriented and the press"
98.16,103.0," was kind of not really part of it, but now it's much more of a show."
103.0,104.0," A show, a shmoosey."
104.0,106.96, I find it a lot more useful than he threw though.
106.96,107.96, How come?
107.96,109.24," Well, but that's not saying a lot, right?"
109.24,110.24," Oh, I'm going to show that."
110.24,111.24, That's true.
111.24,113.72," I mean, they'd say he's supposed to be for the"
113.72,116.44," press and whoever, but it's just it's E3."
116.44,118.48, It's like we've seen it all before we even get there.
118.48,119.48, Right.
119.48,120.48, Right.
120.48,124.08," E3 is the EV employee, EV clerk convention now."
124.08,125.08, Yeah.
125.08,127.36, It's really excuse for everyone to try to crash in the game industry.
127.36,129.44," Yeah, but not that we have a problem with EV employees."
129.44,130.44, No.
130.44,131.44," I mean, a lot of you guys."
131.44,133.96, This is our convention.
133.96,139.84, So what did we see at GDC this year that was interesting that we liked?
139.84,143.2," Well, there was no real big big amount."
143.2,144.72, Like every year was one big huge announcement.
144.72,146.44, There was no big huge announcement this year.
146.44,149.95999999999998, There was just a lot of good little sessions and stuff.
149.95999999999998,154.88," Like, you know, there was not no magic revealed in the PlayStation conference."
154.88,158.44, No big announcement on the revolution and the Nintendo thing.
158.44,159.44, Right.
159.44,160.95999999999998, Will writes things was just like always.
160.95999999999998,162.72, Will write things brilliant as usual.
162.72,166.2," Yeah, just reminding everybody he's smarter than you are."
166.2,169.32, You really feel kind of like an orangutan when you're done listening to him.
169.32,171.35999999999999," It's terribly entertaining though, isn't it?"
171.35999999999999,172.35999999999999, He's so good.
172.8,175.20000000000002," He even makes PowerPoint fun, which is amazing."
175.20000000000002,176.20000000000002, Yeah.
176.20000000000002,178.20000000000002, I wonder how long it takes him to put those together.
178.20000000000002,179.20000000000002, I wish like a power.
179.20000000000002,180.4, So don't he makes those available?
180.4,181.20000000000002, I wish he would.
181.20000000000002,183.20000000000002," Yeah, it's so entertaining."
183.20000000000002,187.44000000000003, The Nintendo thing was interesting to me because I actually liked it.
187.44000000000003,190.88000000000002, I think he was getting better every year too.
190.88000000000002,196.16000000000003, But it did seem like I kept waiting for the revolution announcement and then it never came.
196.16000000000003,197.16000000000003, Yeah.
197.16000000000003,199.16000000000003, You're just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
199.16000000000003,200.88000000000002, by us because you're playing brain age all the time now.
200.88000000000002,201.88000000000002, Brain age rules.
202.88,208.07999999999998," Especially because I'm 26 in brain age, which is much younger than my real age."
208.07999999999998,209.12, So that rocks.
209.12,211.28, That was a young is good in red.
211.28,212.28, You know what?
212.28,213.28, That was cool.
213.28,214.92, I liked that he talked about that game.
214.92,217.88," I mean, he did exactly what his anecdote was, right?"
217.88,225.4, His anecdote was that they had come up with this game concept that was aimed at older people
225.4,226.96, and non-gamers say.
226.96,227.96, Right.
227.96,231.84, And they tried to get the singing to the retailers in Japan and didn't have
232.28,235.64000000000001, and there wasn't much enthusiasm for it because it just sounded boring.
235.64000000000001,236.64000000000001, Right.
236.64000000000001,237.64000000000001, You kind of see did it.
237.64000000000001,238.64000000000001, Like made every way play it.
238.64000000000001,242.84, Bring it home and give it to your families and of course the sales guys to play it before
242.84,244.64000000000001," they would talk sales and stuff, you know."
244.64000000000001,247.04," And sure enough, everybody dug it."
247.04,248.04, Right.
248.04,249.44, How it tough to make a game like that for the PC though?
249.44,252.64000000000001," I mean, like you see all these cool in a bit, and then Nintendo comes with these cool"
252.64000000000001,254.64000000000001, innovations and I just stayed on myself every time.
254.64000000000001,256.24, Why don't we see more of those?
256.24,258.64, But on the PC that thing would be retarded though.
258.64,259.24, You think?
259.24,260.24, Yeah.
260.24,261.64, I'm not saying brain age per thing.
261.64,262.64, Funny stuff like that.
262.64,265.44," I mean, like if you look at the Internet of games that were a PC."
265.44,266.44, Absolutely.
266.44,267.44, Absolutely.
267.44,270.03999999999996, I think you're probably some more creative stuff on display.
270.03999999999996,271.03999999999996, I think about brain age.
271.03999999999996,272.03999999999996, I agree.
272.03999999999996,273.03999999999996, There's one more.
273.03999999999996,276.44," It's like something to do just when you're messing around waiting for, you know."
276.44,279.03999999999996," Like, it's just like, you know, it's just like, you know, it's just like,"
279.03999999999996,281.84, brain age is more mainstream and like everyone's kind of accepting it because it's
281.84,283.24, a portable console or something.
283.24,286.64, I just wish that more of the indie games got the props they deserve.
286.64,287.64, Yeah.
287.64,291.44," Well other than brain age, did anyone see anything?"
291.44,295.84," Well, it was good to see a G.S. physics cards actually implemented in some degree."
295.84,296.84, Yeah.
296.84,297.84, That was really actually pretty cool.
297.84,301.44," Actually, the physics battles that's going on now is going to be ridiculous."
301.44,306.04," This is going to, you know, if you're, it's going to get to be over the next year"
306.04,312.12," to that if your game license, um, havoc, then you'll get some acceleration through your"
312.12,317.0," graphics card and if your game licensed physics from a G.A., then you'll get some"
317.0,321.0," acceleration from their, you know, their physics card."
321.0,328.28000000000003," But, you know, if I'm playing a, have it game licensed game that my G.A. cards, it's"
328.28000000000003,333.52," there like a door stop and vice versa and man, they just need to standardize this stuff"
333.52,338.04," because this is, yeah, it's a eternal PC problem."
338.04,339.04, Yeah.
339.04,343.40000000000003," But, of course, on the other hand, it is, it is cool looking stuff like once you,"
343.40000000000003,348.12," you know, have accelerated physics either through the graphics card or the thing, it's like"
348.12,350.52000000000004," night and day, what's, you know, compared to what you're seeing."
350.52000000000004,352.52000000000004, What games are like going to take advantage of that?
352.52000000000004,353.52000000000004," Well, it's free-con on the PC."
353.52000000000004,354.52000000000004, Yeah.
354.52000000000004,358.36, It's like the first sort of big physics accelerated game.
358.36,359.96000000000004," So what, what kind of things would you see?"
359.96000000000004,364.36," Like, what would I notice if I put one of these in my PC and I, and I booted up this game?"
364.36,368.44," Uh, well, like, solutions more like physics everywhere in the world, basically."
368.44,372.36," Yeah, I mean, a lot of the game play stuff isn't going to be there right away."
372.36,373.76, It's going to be mostly eye-cany stuff.
373.76,377.92," So the truck blows up instead of just like an explosion, some dust and stuff."
377.92,383.32," It's going to have doors and parts flying off and a much more impressive explosion and,"
383.32,384.32," you know, all that kind of stuff."
384.32,386.48, And you guys get to see self-actor at the show?
386.48,387.48, Yeah.
387.48,390.12," I mean, it's just basically it's a pretty much a one-level demo right now."
390.12,394.76," But for those who remember the havoc physics game, uh, synops that came out on the, uh,"
394.76,396.76, what PS2 and Xbox One stuff.
397.08,399.28," It's kind of like, it's like a first person version of that."
399.28,399.8, Really.
399.8,402.36," And it's just you can manipulate anything in the environment, but it's taking advantage of the"
402.36,403.36, AG of physics card.
403.36,404.56," It was pretty cool, actually."
405.2,409.4," Yeah, they have like cloth ripping and like hundreds, just hundreds of barrels and crates and"
409.4,413.56, objects on stuff like that that you can throw around and throw people into them and get
413.56,417.08, physics kills by taking a beam and throwing it and smashing into a guy.
417.08,420.36," And, you know, it hasn't half life to already done this."
420.96,425.15999999999997," It's like, all right, if half life to is dialed up to two, then this is physics dialed up to"
425.24,426.16, ten.
426.16,430.96000000000004," It's like imagine just ten times as many objects, ten times as much physics fidelity and stuff."
430.96000000000004,434.36," Right, because because of having, you know, I think it's because of have, because half life"
434.36,436.56," to it all that stuff, they use to have a, it's a software renderer."
436.56,438.76000000000005," So it's like, it's constrained by the CPU."
438.76000000000005,442.16," But if you have a separate card to make, kind of the same way that in 96 when people start"
442.16,445.92," releasing the graphics cards, you see, like, the thing is, there needs to be that, you"
445.92,451.40000000000003," know, quick GL or Tomb Raider to really show off what the technology can do."
451.40000000000003,452.40000000000003, Yeah.
452.4,453.4, That's the technology.
453.4,455.59999999999997," I mean, then the gameplay just has to support the technology, right?"
455.59999999999997,456.59999999999997, Yeah.
456.59999999999997,457.59999999999997," I mean, I don't know."
457.59999999999997,461.28, It's cool to think that like this truck will explode and the door will come flying
461.28,462.28, at you.
462.28,465.08," But, I mean, right now it sounds like it is, so I can't eat."
465.08,466.08," Yeah, it's good."
466.08,470.2," At first it's going to be I can, because like, if you're a developer, you can't make"
470.2,474.84," the, you can't, you know, rely on everybody having these cards and stuff."
474.84,475.84, So yeah.
475.84,478.96," It'll get there, though."
479.03999999999996,483.4," Our, our physics cards, the new graphics cards."
483.4,485.88," Well, that's what a geo would hope for, right?"
485.88,488.2, Cause they're the only ones making it.
488.2,490.71999999999997," So we don't need one yet, right?"
490.71999999999997,491.71999999999997, You don't need one.
491.71999999999997,492.71999999999997, I PC yet.
492.71999999999997,495.4," But I can imagine like, you know, there's some uses, like, let's say you're playing"
495.4,500.03999999999996," Battlefield 2 or, or Battlefield 3 or whatever, and like, they program in grass."
500.03999999999996,503.52," So like, if you're crawling in the grass, you can't, they can't see your movement,"
503.52,506.4," but if you're running through it, people can see like the grass, part and around you"
506.4,507.4, or something.
507.64,510.88," The little, you know, small things in the environment kind of tip off what you, you know,"
510.88,511.64, what you're doing.
511.64,512.4, That's what the field.
512.4,515.36," Do you know what the solution is in the PS3 because it, uh, epic, sudden,"
515.36,519.9599999999999," real-engined 3 demo, they were showing off some of the, some of the, basically"
519.9599999999999,521.56, physics applications that they're using.
521.56,522.9599999999999," Yeah, that's the 3 thing."
522.9599999999999,524.3199999999999, That's a geo as well.
524.3199999999999,525.6, It's using the source.
525.6,527.0799999999999," It's using a geo software renderer, right?"
527.0799999999999,528.0799999999999, Right.
528.0799999999999,529.0799999999999, But it's all software.
529.0799999999999,530.64," It's just, they're just using the cell."
530.64,532.76, It's like a multi-threaded right on the cell.
532.76,534.72, It's the same thing for the Xbox 360.
534.72,539.0400000000001," They, the G is got their software on, not just their hardware carbon."
539.0400000000001,542.96, They've got software solution for the PC and a software solution for the PS3.
542.96,547.0," And everyone's kind of kind of used that for the PS3 because what Sony did is,"
547.0,552.1600000000001," they bought a giant humongous, expensive license for G is physics for everybody."
552.1600000000001,555.48, So everybody gets it all the PS3 developers get it free.
555.48,559.52," So that was simply, that was purely a software solution in the demo."
559.52,560.52, Yeah.
560.52,563.6," Because they had like this gravitational field going and they had about 60 objects,"
563.6,565.9200000000001, like going around it and they'd eventually achieve orbit.
565.9200000000001,569.2, And then you'd hit it with more rockets and it's really stuff that would just completely
569.2,571.12, crash your computer on half-life too.
571.12,572.12, Yeah.
572.12,575.96," And of course, and it's easy to have physics doing all that stuff when you're not running"
575.96,576.96, a game as well.
576.96,580.0," You know, it's, you gotta think, wow, the CPU can do all that."
580.0,584.72," Yeah, because the CPU is not running AI and it's not loading and unloading stuff"
584.72,590.1600000000001," from the rest of the level and all that other, you know, good stuff."
590.16,593.0, So that was at the big tech thing.
593.0,594.0, Tech wise tech wise.
594.0,597.0," Yeah, physics seemed to be a sort of the big buzz thing."
597.0,598.0," I mean, tech wise."
598.0,601.68," I mean, there was the Nvidia announcement as well and then ATI's been talking about incorporating"
601.68,603.8, the physics into the radio online.
603.8,605.88," Yeah, really what it is, the havoc thing."
605.88,609.36, It's Nvidia made it sound like it's an Nvidia thing.
609.36,610.6, It's not really an Nvidia thing.
610.6,612.16," It's any shader model, three-card."
612.16,613.9599999999999, We'll do the havoc effects thing.
613.9599999999999,618.64, Nvidia's just been working really hard together with havoc to optimize their drivers
618.64,621.3199999999999, and get it working nice with SLI and everything.
621.3199999999999,626.04," But now, what about sound since we have Dr. Cross here today?"
626.04,630.4399999999999, There's not really been any new big announced or advanced.
630.4399999999999,632.52," Well, didn't, well, didn't Razor make that announcement recently."
632.52,635.08," They're going to the audio board business, which seems to be ridiculous."
635.08,639.88," Yeah, Razor set out this press release that they're making like the ultimate gamer sound card"
639.88,645.08, that they went from scratch with an unlimited budget and just like the hyperbole in this press release
645.08,646.08, and unlimited budget.
646.08,649.2," I mean, didn't create a put like what 50 million into the X5 technology?"
649.2,651.8000000000001," At least, yeah, whatever."
651.8000000000001,656.6, It's just a ridiculous press release in general and maybe the card will be great.
656.6,657.6, I don't know.
657.6,658.88, It's not coming out to like Mayor Jr.
658.88,663.2," So, I still haven't set up a 5.1 system on my PC."
663.2,664.84, I have one for my TV.
664.84,666.6," So, I haven't set one up."
666.6,668.0, I don't have one more work at all.
668.0,671.72, And not for lack of free equipment because we have it.
671.72,673.12, I could if I wanted to.
673.12,674.12, Right.
674.12,675.12, Not the brag.
675.4,678.32, But I am not kind of not motivated to.
678.32,682.44," And should I be like, are there enough games that even matter where 5.1 gaming?"
682.44,684.24, I have one on a PC.
684.24,687.32, It's like virtually everything has 3D sound.
687.32,691.52," And if you have 5.1, you'll get sounds behind you and they're sounds behind you."
691.52,692.52, Are you guys playing that way?
692.52,693.52, Any of you?
693.52,694.52, I play on headsets.
694.52,696.52," Yeah, I mean, stuff like a believey."
696.52,699.92," And you know, I mean, you're hearing the wind just like rush past you in all angles and"
699.92,701.16, going through the trees and stuff.
701.16,704.8," But like, Darren says, I play in most of the time multiplayer games and I have team"
704.8,705.8, to speak on.
705.8,708.92, And there's no way my girlfriend's going to tolerate it here.
708.92,710.9599999999999, Those guys yelling throughout the room.
710.9599999999999,712.52, So she has to hear you one way.
712.52,713.52, So she just hears me.
713.52,714.52," Come on, guys."
714.52,715.52," Right, right, right."
715.52,716.52, Let's hit this.
716.52,718.16, How must be sexy for her to hear you?
718.16,719.16, That's good.
719.16,723.1999999999999, Like a champion we were listening to this morning from my god.
723.1999999999999,724.1999999999999, Oh my god.
724.1999999999999,725.1999999999999, It's hit that small.
725.1999999999999,726.1999999999999, Hard.
726.1999999999999,731.4," So I wonder, you know, that'd be a good statistic to know, like percentage of gamers who"
731.4,732.4, are playing on headsets.
732.4,733.4," Say, right, speakers."
733.4,736.4," I mean, I have no idea."
736.4,737.4, I know.
737.4,742.36," I mean, I home, I just don't have room for five dot one on both my TV and my, I don't"
742.36,745.04, know why are this crap in my room.
745.04,747.4," But you know, for headphones, there's some good technology."
747.4,751.4, Like the X-Fi has a pretty good foe 3D headphone technology.
751.4,754.64," And like you can turn on, I think they caught CMS S3D or something."
754.64,758.4," But when you turn that on, any game that's in 3D, they kind of fake it with, you know,"
758.4,760.4," headphone, you know, 8Ds."
760.4,761.4, Maybe that's what we need.
762.4,767.9599999999999," I mean, realistically, how many gamers can have some loud five dot one gaming system"
767.9599999999999,771.76," going, whether they're living with their parents or their wives or whatever."
771.76,772.76, Yeah.
772.76,776.12," Well, even just the logistics of like the wiring, I mean, like, yeah, good desk chair around"
776.12,778.4399999999999," you trip over one wire, the whole thing comes to mumbling over."
778.4399999999999,780.24," The wire said, that's probably the headphones."
780.24,785.0," I just have one of those, you know, like a good $253, $300 set of headphones."
785.0,790.68," And basically, what happens with every set of headphones ever have is once your piece"
790.68,794.4399999999999," goes out, and then eventually the mic starts getting shady, and then the other one goes"
794.4399999999999,795.4399999999999, out.
795.4399999999999,797.4399999999999," And so like this weekend, I just had to ditch the whole thing."
797.4399999999999,802.4399999999999," It's like, get a, that's why only by the cheap ones, because no matter what, they seem"
802.4399999999999,804.12," to, they seem to die, you know."
804.12,806.4399999999999," So I don't, I spend $30 on."
806.4399999999999,807.92, I just can't get into it.
807.92,811.92," I mean, I see the advantage of team speak, but, and maybe I've just heard too many of"
811.92,815.24," the audio files, like, you're passing around this morning."
815.24,819.64," But I just feel like if I get in talking with other gamers in my games, I'm just going"
819.64,823.3199999999999," to, like, be annoyed and feel."
823.3199999999999,828.6," It's like, if you just, if it was like an Xbox live scenario where you just are randomly"
828.6,833.12," hopping into a server, and you see them flash their, you know, their team speak IP, and"
833.12,834.12, you go in there.
834.12,837.88," That's a whole, I mean, that's potentially really awkward situation."
837.88,842.24," I'm talking about where I have friends, old college friends, or door here friends, I mean,"
842.24,845.52," I'm message boards and stuff, and then we will play regularly all the time."
845.52,847.84," So we'd like get along, we're used to joking around."
847.84,851.96," But it can be awkward once and a while, it's like, we'll put an invite up on the CGW or the"
851.96,852.96, EGM forums.
852.96,855.76," Say, hey, come on, we're going to play some battlefield or whatever coming."
855.76,859.08," And then there's always someone comes in, and they're, you know, sipping their coke real"
859.08,860.08, loud.
860.08,864.1600000000001," And they're like, oh, guy, and then they're like, are they're like eating the microphone,"
864.1600000000001,866.36, it's like right on their mouth and they're breathing it all over.
866.36,869.12," Do you ever hear the sound of like, bomb, gurgles, you know?"
869.12,870.96," No, I don't hear that, but I've heard that before."
870.96,871.96, Playing stupid talent actually.
871.96,875.72," There's got to be a little like, there's always the awkward silent type."
875.72,877.32," Yeah, they're talking to him."
877.32,879.32," Ryan, right, right, right."
879.32,880.32, They're crying.
880.32,883.2," You say, hey, what are you doing in this?"
883.2,889.0," Just like my grandma, my grandma's sleeping, so I can't really be loud."
889.0,890.96, It's time for my bed.
890.96,895.6," Yeah, I don't see, I guess if I was playing with friends, right?"
895.6,899.0400000000001," And I knew them, I could see talking through a strategy or something, but I don't want"
899.0400000000001,900.6, to be talking to random.
900.6,902.0400000000001, This is a good connection.
902.0400000000001,906.44, Peter Moore was just in the office last week and you spoke with them.
906.5200000000001,911.8000000000001," Yeah, it seemed that he was intimidating that there would be on, on Vista, some solution,"
911.8000000000001,915.2," to, you know, networking gamers similar to what they have on Xbox Live."
915.2,919.1600000000001," Well, I asked him to straight out, like, why can't we have Xbox Live on the PC?"
919.1600000000001,920.6800000000001," Yeah, PC Live for whatever."
920.6800000000001,922.6400000000001," Yeah, and he wasn't opposed to it."
922.6400000000001,924.84," I mean, I sounded like, I should say it."
924.84,925.84, I've been reading that.
925.84,928.08," I keep talking to guys like, Chris Donnie over there and stuff."
928.08,931.6800000000001," And every time you bring it up, they won't say, no, they're kind of like,"
931.6800000000001,934.8800000000001," winking and nudging and going, yeah, it'd be great if something like that was a no."
934.8800000000001,935.8800000000001," Yeah, you know."
935.88,936.88, I think it's happening.
936.88,937.88, I think they're working on it.
937.88,938.88, Yeah.
938.88,940.52, There's going to be some announcement at E3 or something.
940.52,941.52, I don't know anything.
941.52,942.52, They won't tell me.
942.52,943.52, Right.
943.52,944.52, Right.
944.52,946.52," It's either knowledge, but it would be more sense to say."
946.52,949.16, I was talking to Scott Henson about that.
949.16,951.72, From Microsoft over at GDC.
951.72,955.76," And I was just, you know, taking a step further, just want to have that Xbox Live cross,"
955.76,957.48, Xbox Live PC cross connectivity.
957.48,960.8," So I could be playing with PC, game and talk to a buddy on Xbox Live."
960.8,961.8, Right.
961.8,964.2," I mean, there's some security issues to work out with that kind of thing."
964.2,965.2," Yeah, at least for the chat stuff."
965.2,969.12," Even if they couldn't do it cross Xbox PC, just amongst PC."
969.12,970.12, He's just PC yet.
970.12,971.12, I'm able to do the same thing.
971.12,972.6800000000001, I can see what your buddies are playing.
972.6800000000001,973.6800000000001," I mean, I know."
973.6800000000001,975.6800000000001, The hard part is you can't force people to use it.
975.6800000000001,980.0," I mean, they're making some full-the Xbox so they can say if you're doing it online,"
980.0,984.0, it has to be Xbox Live and you have to hook into this APIs that we can see what you're
984.0,985.0, playing it.
985.0,985.96, You can't force EA to do that.
985.96,987.6400000000001, So that kind of breaks it.
987.6400000000001,992.24," Like, if your friends playing battlefield three, an EA has just chosen not to support"
992.24,994.2, the PC live or whatever.
994.2,996.9200000000001, And then you can't see that he's playing online or in Vitamin or anything.
996.9200000000001,997.9200000000001, That's a good thing.
997.9200000000001,998.9200000000001," Well, it's a good way."
998.9200000000001,999.9200000000001, And they don't charge it.
999.9200000000001,1001.6400000000001, I'll see why any developer would be opposed to it.
1001.6400000000001,1003.9200000000001, It's just good for people.
1003.9200000000001,1005.24, Makes them want to play online.
1005.24,1006.24, Aha.
1006.24,1009.76," Well, I mean, right now, I mean, it's X-Fier's doing the same thing right now for PC,"
1009.76,1010.76, gamers.
1010.76,1011.76, Right.
1011.76,1013.1600000000001," But again, it's like Jason saying that, right?"
1013.1600000000001,1014.2800000000001, You've got a willingly loaded.
1014.2800000000001,1015.2800000000001, And there's so many characters.
1015.2800000000001,1017.12, And there's so many choices.
1017.12,1018.12, Yeah.
1018.12,1022.5600000000001," So, but I would not be surprised at all if like at E3 or some Microsoft comes out with some"
1022.56,1024.8, announcement that they're doing a live thing on PC.
1024.8,1025.8, And it's.
1025.8,1027.32," Yeah, I'm so jealous of the whole achievements thing."
1027.32,1028.32, It seems like a lot of.
1028.32,1030.84," That has been like, I don't really care about my achievements."
1030.84,1031.84, I just play the game.
1031.84,1033.24," Oh, my achievements, whatever."
1033.24,1037.6," But there, I've got friends who are just hardcore competitive about what their achievements"
1037.6,1038.6, score is.
1038.6,1039.6, Yeah.
1039.6,1040.6, That would really get moved.
1040.6,1041.6," Well, Microsoft's part of the course."
1041.6,1042.6, It's a lot of fun.
1042.6,1043.6, Yeah.
1043.6,1047.0," Maybe we could do that with CGW achievements for like getting through, you know, Darren's"
1047.0,1048.0, column.
1048.0,1049.0, That kind of thing.
1049.0,1050.0, Surviving an issue.
1050.0,1051.0, Two hundred points for each of you.
1051.24,1054.74," One up dot com actually tried to beat, I mean, technically beat them to the punch with"
1054.74,1055.74, the whole.
1055.74,1056.74, That's right.
1056.74,1057.74, That's right.
1057.74,1059.28," I don't know if I call on this well, but it."
1059.28,1062.68, I know the thing with achievements that bugs me so much is that you see people playing
1062.68,1066.52, like they're actually renting and getting games just as sources for these points.
1066.52,1067.52, Yeah.
1067.52,1068.88, And they're playing votes that were it's painful.
1068.88,1071.48," Like, she was saying, you know, he's playing such and such a game on the extreme"
1071.48,1072.48, difficulty.
1072.48,1073.48, He's first round through.
1073.48,1077.08, And this is a nice idea of trying to get me a monthly and talking about.
1077.08,1078.4," And it's like, why are you doing that?"
1078.4,1079.4, What do you get with these points?
1079.4,1081.68, Are they going to send you some free games or something?
1081.68,1085.0," And it's like, no, it's just just breaking."
1085.0,1086.0," Breaking, right?"
1086.0,1086.8400000000001, And even that.
1086.8400000000001,1090.44," Hey, if that's if it's that much fun for you to have that breaking, right?"
1090.44,1091.92, Then go ahead and play on extreme.
1091.92,1093.96, If it's kind of like our one out of points.
1093.96,1095.2, Like what is those good for?
1095.2,1096.2, Right.
1096.2,1098.72," Like I've got a lot of points now from just doing more blogging, whatever."
1098.72,1099.72," And I was like, cool."
1099.72,1101.24, Now I've got whatever 1000 points.
1101.24,1102.24," But you can go, what?"
1102.24,1103.76, You can go in an autographed Jeff Green.
1103.76,1104.76," Oh, shit."
1105.56,1107.6, Great.
1107.6,1110.2," Sorry, I cussed."
1110.2,1112.92," So yeah, again, it's on the PC site itself, fragmented."
1112.92,1117.76, You'll see it sporadically like in a game like battlefield where it's tracking all
1117.76,1118.92, that information.
1118.92,1123.04," You can go to a certain site and see it every award, every metal and ribbon you've unlocked."
1123.04,1126.0, There's actually far more achievements in that game than there would be in any technically
1126.0,1127.4, in any 360 game.
1127.4,1133.08," But it's like, you can't compare that to someone's status in age of empires or something."
1133.08,1134.08, Right.
1135.04,1135.84, Would it be useful?
1136.84,1137.32, No.
1137.32,1138.72," Oh, that's not the point."
1138.72,1139.08, Useful.
1139.08,1142.0," Yeah, it's just just what people do."
1142.0,1144.84," I guess if we are talking about usefulness, we'd all have different jobs."
1144.84,1145.36, Right.
1145.36,1146.36, Yeah.
1146.36,1148.0, Not that this isn't important.
1148.0,1148.52, It's just a matter.
1148.52,1149.6799999999998," Yeah, it's at fun for you or not."
1149.6799999999998,1151.96," And look, some people really get into it."
1151.96,1154.32," Yeah, funds overrated."
1154.32,1156.12, This ass Ryan.
1156.12,1158.12," No, no, no."
1158.12,1159.12," Oh, come on."
1159.12,1160.12, He's not in the room.
1160.12,1161.12, He's not here.
1161.12,1163.96, He didn't talk last week.
1163.96,1164.96, He's not here.
1164.96,1167.76, He hid when it was time to come down here to do the podcast.
1167.76,1169.4," Actually, he is here right now in the room."
1169.4,1171.8, He just still refused to say to me.
1171.8,1173.72, And we're doing it on time.
1173.72,1174.72, It's at 20 minutes.
1174.72,1177.0," We're at, wow, it's a long time at talking."
1177.0,1178.0, So I want it.
1178.0,1181.96, Let's segue into our regular regular.
1181.96,1184.24," What you play in, Willis feature."
1184.24,1187.2, Is anybody playing anything new or different?
1187.2,1188.68, These days on their PC?
1188.68,1190.64," I'm playing oblivion, but not on the PC."
1190.64,1191.64, I'm playing.
1191.64,1195.88, I've got the 360 version because my girlfriend wanted to play it on the TV.
1195.88,1198.5600000000002," So, it's the same game, right?"
1198.5600000000002,1201.72," So, in fact, it's like the TV though, better."
1201.72,1202.88, It's use more approachable.
1202.88,1205.2," Well, I mean, she's actually a big PC fan."
1205.2,1207.76," And she's, you know, said for addict and all that stuff."
1207.76,1211.72," But this list, let's, one of us use the PC while the other person uses the TV to play"
1211.72,1213.3600000000001, that since it's not.
1213.3600000000001,1216.64," Interestingly enough, we still don't have any copies of oblivion."
1216.64,1217.64, Yeah.
1217.64,1222.2800000000002," Actually, even though we called out last week for Pete to send us some, we still don't"
1222.2800000000002,1223.6000000000001, have any.
1223.6000000000001,1224.88, This just in over a game.
1224.88,1227.88," Oh, did you get your copies today?"
1227.88,1230.2800000000002, Just check your tracking number and it shows it was delivered this morning.
1230.2800000000002,1231.2800000000002, Really?
1231.2800000000002,1232.2800000000002, That comes from Bethesda.
1232.2800000000002,1233.2800000000002, That is check the mail room.
1233.2800000000002,1235.0800000000002," Oh, I'm so sorry, Pete."
1235.0800000000002,1236.0800000000002," Pete, we love you."
1236.0800000000002,1237.0800000000002, We're going to check the mail room.
1237.0800000000002,1238.88, Thanks for sending our copies of oblivion.
1238.88,1243.16," But if, but if, but if we're taking up, I knew you would switch off oblivion to some"
1243.16,1245.1200000000001, of the other fine games that you're playing.
1245.12,1246.12, And now you got a bomb force.
1246.12,1249.36, I actually gave into the dark side on oblivion.
1249.36,1253.1599999999999, There's an exploit for all you out there who like to exit.
1253.1599999999999,1254.1599999999999, Right.
1254.1599999999999,1255.1599999999999," Oh, no."
1255.1599999999999,1257.12, I didn't tell a district of Imperial City that you're doing.
1257.12,1258.32, You go into his house.
1258.32,1260.9199999999998, You kill him by behind closed doors.
1260.9199999999998,1263.4799999999998," And basically, he's an infinite gold farm."
1263.4799999999998,1266.3999999999999, All you do is keep clicking on his gold and they'll keep giving you gold.
1266.3999999999999,1269.8, So I took like a hundred thousand off him and then left.
1269.8,1271.4399999999998, It's like a spoiled game for you.
1271.4399999999998,1272.4399999999998, I know.
1272.4399999999998,1273.4399999999998, It does.
1273.44,1274.44, I know.
1274.44,1275.68," It's like, but it's not like having God mode."
1275.68,1280.28," It's not, it's all leveled so that I'm not able to go by, you know, weapons that are"
1280.28,1282.0, going to end of the game ones.
1282.0,1285.3200000000002, It's only going to give me access to a few very expensive weapons.
1285.3200000000002,1286.3200000000002, So you have to be in a bubble.
1286.3200000000002,1287.3200000000002, I'll have to.
1287.3200000000002,1288.3200000000002, Yeah.
1288.3200000000002,1289.3200000000002, Okay.
1289.3200000000002,1292.1200000000001," So if you know, I'm level 15 or whatever, I'll be able to get a few pieces of armor"
1292.1200000000001,1293.1200000000001, for that.
1293.1200000000001,1294.1200000000001, But that's it though.
1294.1200000000001,1297.3600000000001," I mean, and even, you know, buying, you can't buy training past a certain point."
1297.3600000000001,1301.72," So really, it just gave me, it got me out of the situation where I was looking at two"
1301.72,1305.3600000000001, rare pieces of armor and had this like flip a coin on which one I wanted and I got them
1305.3600000000001,1306.3600000000001, both.
1306.3600000000001,1307.3600000000001, So you cheated.
1307.3600000000001,1308.3600000000001, I actually waited.
1308.3600000000001,1309.3600000000001, I did cheat.
1309.3600000000001,1310.3600000000001, It's in the game.
1310.3600000000001,1311.3600000000001, It's a feature.
1311.3600000000001,1312.3600000000001, It's a feature.
1312.3600000000001,1314.0, I didn't put codes in.
1314.0,1315.0, I didn't open the console.
1315.0,1316.0, There's no hot coffee.
1316.0,1318.24, I just killed that dude and he just had more so we now.
1318.24,1320.2, I whole lot of money on him.
1320.2,1321.76," Well, I played all weekend."
1321.76,1324.2, I played something that I was anticipating hating.
1324.2,1328.04," In fact, I actually installed it just so I can make fun of it."
1328.04,1330.44, And then it turned out the joke was on me because I kind of liked it.
1330.44,1333.04, And it was the godfather sleeping.
1333.04,1335.0800000000002," You sleep with the fish now, Jeff."
1335.0800000000002,1336.0800000000002, Yeah.
1336.0800000000002,1337.64," You know, it's not great."
1337.64,1340.2," But I mean, didn't we all think it was going to suck?"
1340.2,1344.52, It just had the makings of just a completely bad idea to me.
1344.52,1346.8400000000001, Why would you make a game out of this movie?
1346.8400000000001,1351.24," Well, it just looks like a generic, another generic, and yet another generic, Grand Thief"
1351.24,1352.24, Dota with feature stone.
1352.24,1354.8," Yeah, didn't they make the godfather call it my feel?"
1354.8,1356.8," Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking."
1356.8,1357.8, They did.
1357.8799999999999,1362.2," And yeah, so it's completely a GTA rip off right down to, you know, getting the"
1362.2,1364.1599999999999," missions, the free form city."
1364.1599999999999,1366.72, And the other stuff that's supposed to be unique to it is stolen too.
1366.72,1369.44," Like, say the coercion system is right off of the Punisher game."
1369.44,1369.72, Yeah.
1369.72,1372.68, It was on Xbox and PS2 where it's context based.
1372.68,1376.44," You take someone and put that in the fryer and okay, I never liked that."
1376.44,1380.48," So basically, all of the features that they're listing is being, you know, the unique things"
1380.48,1384.6399999999999," that make this game all come from somewhere else from a game in the past, you know, for"
1384.6399999999999,1385.6399999999999, you.
1385.6399999999999,1386.6399999999999, Right.
1386.64,1390.3600000000001," It's just, it only because it didn't suck as bad as I thought it would."
1390.3600000000001,1393.24," You know, my expectations are so low."
1393.24,1394.24, And that's a key thing.
1394.24,1395.88, Did you pay money for it?
1395.88,1396.88, Hell now.
1396.88,1401.72," Okay, because I'll say maybe some people getting that situation works like, I just spent"
1401.72,1402.72, 50 bucks on this.
1402.72,1403.72, I'd get must be good.
1403.72,1404.72, I don't like it.
1404.72,1405.72," Yeah, right."
1405.72,1406.72," Make yourself like, how do I paid for this?"
1406.72,1407.72," Yeah, I don't know."
1407.72,1408.72, So how much they put into this?
1408.72,1410.8400000000001," I mean, I forget I know these pensome, I absorbed it in a money to put this game"
1410.8400000000001,1411.8400000000001, together.
1411.8400000000001,1413.5600000000002, Was it like 40 million or something?
1413.56,1416.48," All the license was expensive to begin with, yeah."
1416.48,1421.1599999999999, And I'll tell you some of the voices and some of the physical characteristics like
1421.1599999999999,1423.32, the heaped the go-to character are amazing.
1423.32,1424.84, It looks just like a go-to.
1424.84,1425.84, If that matters to you.
1425.84,1428.6399999999999, You know what you want out of your gaming is a real-so-cape the go-to.
1428.6399999999999,1429.6399999999999, Has a big fish fan.
1429.6399999999999,1430.6399999999999, I had a guy.
1430.6399999999999,1431.6399999999999, I had a guy.
1431.6399999999999,1433.28, And the James Con character.
1433.28,1434.76, But the Michael Caroleone character.
1434.76,1438.04," I mean, I know that they had problems with the contractor without Pacino."
1438.04,1439.72, So we ended up not doing the voice.
1439.72,1442.32," But now I'm wondering if they had the like, changes appearance."
1442.32,1444.8, Because it doesn't look anything like Al Pacino at all.
1444.8,1446.2, It's like some random dude.
1446.2,1448.6399999999999," And he's kind of the main character, right?"
1448.6399999999999,1454.08, I bet that is because using a likeness has to be like some astral.
1454.08,1455.4399999999998, The face actors and stuff.
1455.4399999999998,1457.32," So if he wouldn't do the voice, I bet he wouldn't."
1457.32,1458.32, Right.
1458.32,1459.32, It's likeness or whatever.
1459.32,1460.32, So that sucks.
1460.32,1461.32, But I'll tell you what I did.
1461.32,1466.52, I like that there's this kind of clever Rosencran's a golden-sern theme running through
1466.52,1472.28," it in which you're the guy who, you know, everything that happened off the screen."
1472.32,1476.52, Stage in the movie is what you're doing in the Godfather's game.
1476.52,1479.52, So you're getting the horse's head.
1479.52,1485.12, You're the guy who puts the gun in the bathroom for Michael Caroleone to knock off.
1485.12,1486.12, Was it Salotso?
1486.12,1487.12, I forget.
1487.12,1488.12, Yeah.
1488.12,1492.24," Anyway, you know, so you're, you know, all those things that you wondered how they happened"
1492.24,1494.12," in the Godfather, you're that guy."
1494.12,1497.28, So that was kind of a clever concede.
1497.28,1501.3999999999999," But yeah, now that you have me wondering if I just liked it because it was free."
1502.3600000000001,1504.3600000000001, Maybe it's not so good.
1504.3600000000001,1506.16," Well, they did lower the price for 40 bucks."
1506.16,1509.68," So I mean, maybe it's 40 bucks worth of fun, but it's still, I don't know."
1509.68,1511.64," It doesn't, it didn't bring enough originality to it."
1511.64,1515.92," I mean, it was fun for what it was, but without GTA, there's no Godfather."
1515.92,1516.92, Right.
1516.92,1520.24," So the thing, they completely got it from that game."
1520.24,1520.92, Yeah.
1520.92,1521.92, Anything else?
1521.92,1524.92," So I believe in, we talked about last week, we're still playing it this week."
1524.92,1526.48, We playing that for a month.
1526.48,1528.48, I don't think there's so many four months.
1528.48,1530.48, So many 30 hours here too.
1530.56,1531.48, Yeah.
1531.48,1534.32," The mods are starting to appear for the PC version a little tweaks here and there,"
1534.32,1536.16, but there's some cool stuff.
1536.16,1538.96, So we already sang the game of the year.
1538.96,1540.56, Not that we passed out that award anymore.
1540.56,1543.56," You guys don't need to play it, but I think you're seeing a definite contender."
1543.56,1544.56," I mean, definitely."
1544.56,1545.56, It's pretty great.
1545.56,1546.56, It's a discussion with Godfather.
1546.56,1550.64," It's got so many like, anytime they try and do these big, expansive worlds, they always"
1550.64,1554.1200000000001," have all these little flaws, like all these, you know, this thing's broken or that thing's"
1554.1200000000001,1556.8, buggy or the AI doesn't do this or something.
1556.8,1558.56, But you can't stop playing it.
1558.6399999999999,1560.84, It's completely absorbing.
1560.84,1566.48," What's amazing to me is that the older Elder Scrolls games arena, dagger farm,"
1566.48,1571.8799999999999," Marlwind, Marlwind was a little more mainstream, but dagger farm arena were hardcore,"
1571.8799999999999,1575.36, RPG games that only real RPG gigs would play.
1575.36,1580.1599999999999," But oblivion is having this real mass, like it's kind of the game that all gamers want"
1580.1599999999999,1584.6," to play regardless of genre, regardless of platform."
1584.6,1589.6799999999998, It's just kind of neat the way Bethesda has come around into the mainstream.
1589.6799999999998,1593.84," Kind of like how, basically, how coach or was kind of like a really hardcore RPG just"
1593.84,1594.84, dressed up differently.
1594.84,1595.84, Yeah.
1595.84,1599.3999999999999," But I wonder how it is that oblivion achieved this, you know?"
1599.3999999999999,1601.3999999999999, Timing is pretty impressive.
1601.3999999999999,1602.6799999999998, Sixty thing is helping.
1602.6799999999998,1603.6799999999998, Yeah.
1603.6799999999998,1607.8, People that got that system are waiting to see something that justifies what it can
1607.8,1609.9199999999998," do, and this is definitely one of those games."
1609.9199999999998,1611.52, So a lot of it's the AI can do.
1611.52,1612.52, Maybe.
1612.52,1613.52, Yeah.
1613.52,1616.36," And it's, you know, top-selling game for that."
1616.36,1621.08," And I mean, it's been a popular series, but traditionally it's not that popular."
1621.08,1624.56," It's not like, oh, there's a new Ghost Recon, let's get the pre-order out, you know?"
1624.56,1627.2," So I think a lot of it's just, you know, for two at his time, you know, like that."
1627.2,1631.84," But then also, is that a lot of people, I think, like me, you speak for myself, like"
1631.84,1636.24, we're interested in all the RPG-like things that are going on in these games.
1636.24,1638.92," But we want the action component, too, to keep us engaged."
1638.92,1639.92, And that's definitely there.
1639.92,1642.48, And the people are the word about spread and really well on that.
1642.48,1643.48, It's one of those games.
1643.48,1646.16," Yeah, that actual combat and stuff is a lot more action."
1646.16,1647.16, And it's a lot more fun.
1647.16,1649.16," I mean, it's no di-rolling, thank God."
1649.16,1652.84," Yeah, and it's not, it's not just like you click and you know, it's, you know, you feel"
1652.84,1656.6, like you're hitting the buttons and swinging the swords and shooting your spells.
1656.6,1659.88," And it's, it's a little more shooter-like in that kind of feel to it."
1659.88,1662.44," So, I think people are digging that."
1662.44,1665.72," I think also, like, when Grantiff Dotto 3 first came out, and it was sort of a game"
1665.72,1669.08, of anecdotes where everyone wanted to tell you about this happened or this.
1669.08,1670.08, Did you try this?
1670.08,1673.0," And it's definitely a game like that where, you know, on message boards and stuff,"
1673.0,1676.76," you're seeing someone just coming out and saying, hey, this happened today."
1676.76,1677.76, This was really interesting.
1677.76,1679.48," You know, that's actually, that's a good point."
1679.48,1685.1999999999998," Is that, you know, Grantiff Dotto wasn't the first sort of open world simulation"
1685.1999999999998,1687.3999999999999, the game by a long stretch.
1687.3999999999999,1692.12, But it really made it popular in between the time of more wind and the Olivia.
1692.12,1695.96, So the fact that it's one of those kind of games that now is kind of a popular idea.
1695.96,1697.28," Maybe that's part of it, too."
1697.32,1700.08, It was all beating up hookers thing that gave G-t.
1700.08,1701.08, Did you?
1701.08,1702.8799999999999, I'm trying to hook her to beat up in a Olivia.
1702.8799999999999,1704.68, That's the sign of a truly good game.
1704.68,1706.28, That's what I like to tell all the characters.
1706.28,1707.28, There is one.
1707.28,1708.28, There is one.
1708.28,1709.28," Yeah, I guess."
1709.28,1710.8799999999999," I know where she's at, right?"
1710.8799999999999,1712.68, I know where she works.
1712.68,1714.8799999999999," Because really, that's what we want as gamers."
1714.8799999999999,1716.28, The ability to beat up hookers.
1719.28,1721.28, We don't need issues to work out now.
1721.28,1724.68, Why is it that the beating up hookers thing that came so attached to G-t?
1724.68,1726.28," I mean, you could beat up anyone in that game."
1726.28,1727.28, Right.
1727.28,1728.28," I mean, the cop being in cops got to me."
1728.28,1730.28, Because they showed us like TV or whatever.
1730.28,1731.28," But it's just, it's all said this."
1731.28,1732.28, This game is being put in hookers.
1732.28,1733.28, People in hookers.
1733.28,1736.28," Well, it was the fact that you could have sex with them and then beat them up."
1736.28,1737.28, Wasn't that it?
1737.28,1738.28, Wasn't that the same?
1738.28,1740.28, It's not sex by Bill Clinton terms.
1740.28,1742.28, But now you could have bouncing a car with them.
1742.28,1743.28, It's what you could have.
1743.28,1744.28, Right.
1744.28,1745.28, Woohoo.
1745.28,1746.28, It's the same.
1746.28,1747.28, For those who can't see us.
1747.28,1748.28, You got to make it with them.
1748.28,1750.28, You can only have the same address.
1750.28,1751.28, You can only have the same address.
1751.28,1752.28, You can only have the same address.
1752.28,1753.28, You can only have the same address.
1753.28,1754.28, You can only have the same address.
1755.28,1758.28, It's just so lucky I'm not on Mike.
1758.28,1762.28, We're sending this whole podcast to Congressman Yi.
1762.28,1767.28, He could just present it to Congress as evidence of why all games should be banned.
1767.28,1769.28, That's where games are evil.
1769.28,1772.28, And why we're all going to hell.
1772.28,1773.28, Okay.
1773.28,1775.28, So last thing.
1775.28,1776.28, What else we play?
1776.28,1777.28, Nothing.
1777.28,1778.28, This past week.
1778.28,1779.28," I've been like, just."
1779.28,1780.28, I've been so busy with GDC.
1780.28,1781.28, I didn't get a chance to play a whole lot.
1781.28,1782.28, Yeah.
1783.28,1784.28," Oh, do not."
1784.28,1786.28," Not that I think any of you would, but do not see Stale."
1786.28,1789.28, I've horrible horrible horrible movie.
1789.28,1790.28, I never even heard of it.
1790.28,1791.28, Only see it if you're drunk.
1791.28,1793.28, That's the only way I can recommend viewing that film.
1793.28,1795.28, That's best if you're 18.
1795.28,1798.28, That's what's what does I maybe?
1798.28,1800.28, It's a video game that kills people.
1800.28,1801.28, It's the ring.
1801.28,1802.28," Oh, it's a video game."
1802.28,1803.28, It's a game.
1803.28,1804.28, It's a game.
1804.28,1805.28, Okay.
1805.28,1807.28, They still every lame horror convention from every horror movie you've ever seen.
1807.28,1809.28, And they slammed it into one get into one movie.
1809.28,1812.28," Like, uh, what we're saying nightmare in Elm Street means video game."
1812.28,1815.28," It's like if you die in the game, you die in real life."
1815.28,1818.28, So what they should rant instead is existence.
1818.28,1819.28," Oh, yeah."
1819.28,1820.28, That was pretty good.
1820.28,1821.28, That was a good movie.
1821.28,1825.28," If we had the budget, what I'd like to do is make a parody of the stay alive though."
1825.28,1828.28," Because, I mean, the whole point is that if you die in the game, you die in life."
1828.28,1829.28, Right.
1829.28,1832.28," Of course, in games, we die for all these ridiculous and arbitrary reasons."
1832.28,1837.28," So it's like, you know, what if the dudes playing GTA and he stepped in a puddle and died or something?"
1837.28,1840.28," Like, you're waiting for a plane on the runway and battlefield and it's spawned on you."
1840.28,1843.28," Blue you up, you know, like, some good stuff in there."
1843.28,1845.28, That's called material.
1845.28,1847.28," That'd be a pretty hard core game, huh?"
1847.28,1848.28, Somebody's got to work on that.
1848.28,1850.28, You die in the game.
1850.28,1851.28, You die in real life.
1851.28,1853.28, Imagine all the bug testers in that game.
1853.28,1856.28, Does it work the other way too?
1856.28,1859.28," Like, if you get rich in the game, you get rich in real life."
1859.28,1861.28, That's a great way to get super powers in the game.
1861.28,1863.28," Wait for the sequel, man."
1863.28,1864.28, All right.
1864.28,1866.28, So that's Darren's Musk to avoid.
1866.28,1867.28, Yeah.
1867.28,1868.28, Okay.
1868.28,1870.28," But about that, I don't want to about the game tester."
1870.28,1871.28," Oh, Mama's boy."
1871.28,1872.28," Yeah, I hear that."
1872.28,1873.28," Oh, grandma's boy, right up here."
1873.28,1874.28, That's got all full.
1874.28,1875.28, That was equally horrible.
1875.28,1876.28, You saw that?
1876.28,1877.28," No, no, no."
1877.28,1878.28, They sent me the video tape.
1878.28,1879.28, Oh.
1879.28,1884.28," And I couldn't actually bring myself to, like, choke down the vomit before watching that thing."
1884.28,1888.28," So I handed it off to GFord, who actually apparently watched it on this past weekend."
1888.28,1889.28, No big shock.
1889.28,1890.28, How much is sucked?
1890.28,1894.28," What we need is a movie where like the gamer is George Clooney, you know?"
1894.28,1897.28," Like, yeah, you know?"
1897.28,1900.28," Not where it's like, who is in Mama's boy?"
1900.28,1901.28, Who was that?
1901.28,1905.28," Oh, like one of the sea list actors that it was attached to like Adam's sandwich films."
1905.28,1906.28, Why?
1906.28,1908.28, Why are we always portrayed as geeks?
1908.28,1909.28, We're not.
1909.28,1910.28, Yeah.
1910.28,1911.28, We're at handsome.
1911.28,1913.28," We're dashing even, I'd say."
1913.28,1914.28, There's a right.
1914.28,1915.28, We're athletic.
1915.28,1916.28, I don't know.
1916.28,1918.28, The Darren admitted to having seen both of those movies.
1918.28,1919.28," No, no, no, no, no, no."
1919.28,1920.28, I saw one.
1920.28,1922.28, I always saw a stay alive.
1923.28,1925.28, In the context knowing it was going to be stupid.
1925.28,1926.28," Oh, yeah."
1926.28,1928.28," And you still want your time back, right?"
1928.28,1929.28," No, no, actually I enjoyed it."
1929.28,1931.28, It was a very communal experience.
1931.28,1933.28," Okay, I think we're done here."
1933.28,1934.28," Yeah, pretty much."
1934.28,1935.28, We're done here.
1935.28,1936.28, We were done for 20 minutes.
1936.28,1940.28," If we haven't driven you away, we will do so next week."
1940.28,1942.28, And we thank you for listening.
1942.28,1943.28, Tatah.
1943.28,1944.28, Over and out.
