0.0,6.08," Hi! Welcome to GFW Radio. This is Jeff Green of Game Swinders,"
6.08,11.68, the official magazine that's January 23rd 2008. We're back after four
11.68,17.76," day weekend, woohoo, and we're here to podcast for you, and I'm here with the"
17.76,20.56, usual gang. Ryan Scott.
20.56,22.72," Go on, man."
22.72,28.080000000000002," And Sean Maloo. And Sean, you get these kind of like almost like"
28.08,31.68, Tourette's like me and Scott in your head. You've been saying
31.68,34.96, Conan for the last time talking about Conan online. Have a
34.96,40.08," day of the game. Yeah, to Conan, uh, let's just write into the new"
40.08,45.84," showy, uh, Adrian Conan got bumped to me 20th from its release."
45.84,49.68," It got bumped two more months, which is ironical, because"
49.68,53.76, the chronic. I'm using that word in just fairly ironical. I
53.76,57.04," know, I know the real word, uh, because we just wrote that up for our big"
57.04,65.03999999999999, delay of Game Story in. I'm sorry. I can't have a serious conversation.
65.03999999999999,70.88, Because Sean Elliott is grooming the yellow hair on this green
70.88,78.0, one frog that we got here in the office that sings Britney Spears songs.
78.0,81.6," And that was a sample. I brought this down. This is Chris, Chris,"
81.67999999999999,86.39999999999999," Ben Boyard, E. James, if I'm as for his love of an electronic bullshit."
86.39999999999999,90.16, And that this is from the series called Frogs.
90.16,95.36," Robert, rocket, rap it, rib it, and uh, frogs with the Z. The back of"
95.36,99.36," boxes, uh, Yokeus, they got the clothes, the most style,"
99.36,104.16," for real, yokelect them all. And then um, you can also get 90s version."
104.16,109.11999999999999," This, the good thing about this, so is it, it's a Britney Spears frog in, uh,"
109.12,114.88000000000001," like a pink workout outfit. It's a Chris, I was at it ripped off the animatronic hands so"
114.88000000000001,119.28," that they're like, he's motorized plastic stubs protruding from the torso. And then he"
119.28,124.56, tore out one of the eyes and pulled the stuffing out and then replaced it with some other
124.56,130.96," gross, viny, Halloween eye on the one side. But anyway, yeah, Chris has some issues. Really nice"
130.96,134.56," to get. Chris, I don't know why this Chris been feeling the need to buy these things and then"
134.56,139.2," destroy them. And then destroy them. And then he was, you know, he was originally employed at"
139.2,143.12," Disneyland in the hall of presence and he was fired when the, um, you might have seen the video on"
143.12,150.08, YouTube when the Abraham Lincoln sort of collapsed over and the audio's audio file just like got
150.08,154.4, all super low and messed up. So this is it. It all goes back to that four score.
155.68,160.32," And then they fired him. And ever since he's kind of like been, so that's why he not defaces"
160.72,166.56," do any things on a frog's. Yeah, this thing really disturbs me. It epitomizes all the things in"
166.56,172.56, the world that should never have been made. Things that shouldn't exist. And it's 9999. I think that's
172.56,176.79999999999998," Chris, but the way I'm saying, I don't know. Well, actually he buys them. So that's the first thing"
176.79999999999998,182.4, you shouldn't do when you want to protest the existence of pink jumpsuited this fierce frogs
182.4,187.2," that sing. Did he buy it? Maybe one more time. You share he bought it. Well, or someone got it."
187.2,194.88, He stole it. Yeah. I can say it's full real. Yo on the back. We get a lot of stuff in that
194.88,200.16, that the games industry that's along the same lines promotional products for games that I can pick
200.16,205.44, you that coming with like a Game Boy Advance copy of Frogger. That would never come with a PC game
205.44,209.92," because we're a more sophisticated crowd. We get no such a chopstick. So we don't mean like, well,"
209.92,214.56," they do that in stores too. So like a lot of like listeners will be thinking like, I, when you"
214.56,220.96, pre-order a game and you get like a sweat towel or something. But this is just sometimes for any
220.96,226.72," given game. They might week after week, you know, for over a period of two months, send something"
226.72,233.12," loosely related to the game. It's manufactured. Yeah. Side of the world. To me, this is just one of"
233.12,238.4," these end of civilization kind of objects. I mean, who the fuck would buy one of these? Who would"
238.4,244.4," be at a store to think? And I know what my kid needs. Yeah. Feel the frog of the things, Britney Spears songs."
245.2,252.16, With a bunch of faux urban language on the side. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Feel it in fat. P. H. T.
252.16,256.24," Well, I'm going to start on the C. R. R. Those. I just like to get them all started at once and then go away."
258.4,264.32," I feel sorry for kids that they grow, but that thing. Right. Maybe it's their only toy. Maybe it's"
264.32,265.12, only friend.
267.36,273.44, That's what he said. Yeah. I'm pretty sure to attach me to my job. I would have this weird like empathy
273.52,277.68," for an anime objects just for everything in the world. Well, like a block of wood and anime"
277.68,281.92," objects, not not to that level, but like if you see like an especially like dopey looking toy or"
281.92,286.64, something like we used to shop in the thrift store and I was little when we were when we were poor
286.64,291.68," and you'd see like some dollar or something and I just feel bad for like a stuffed animal,"
291.68,296.24," a cat or something. I don't feel bad for it. Like, oh man. But not even just like anthropomorphic or"
296.24,300.08," our animalistic things like that. Just it could be anything. I just like, I feel sorry that"
300.15999999999997,306.0, the thing makes me sad looking at it. Why don't feel sorry for the thing? I feel sorry that like
306.0,311.59999999999997, people spent their time making it. Then somebody spent the time buying it to put in their store.
312.56,316.32, A lot of somebody else is a lot of effort that goes in the field. The transported across the
316.32,322.4," world and then when it arrived here, right, then to get it into the you know to the warehouse and then"
322.4,328.56, to the store. I'm ready for our ape overlords to take over. Do anything? I guess so. I could tell you
328.64,332.72, he's a cat. His crowd could do a better job. The alarming news this morning. I haven't
332.72,338.0, PR is my alarm and I wake up and I'm here to about a minute stock market crash and how
338.0,344.88, nearly we have heard it how nearly a reduction in interest rate ofverted a catastrophic crash
345.44,349.92," the past two days. This morning worldwide yesterday, but it was you know bank holiday."
350.96,353.92," Going into politics. Yeah, what we're reading different news stories because the first"
354.0,360.08000000000004," story I read was that Amy Winehouse was photographs smoking a pipe. Yeah, we're watching different"
360.08000000000004,364.32," news. When you think about that, though, with that's the that's the face of the world and you're like"
364.32,371.76, and yet we're still feeling fine and fat. I'm not feeling so fine. I'm so long.
372.96000000000004,379.92," Well, let's get on the critical news and PC gaming land. All right, that's what really matters in the world."
380.0,384.0, So I was I said that age of counting got delayed for a month.
385.44,389.12," And we just wrote about that in our delay of game feature, but at that point we didn't even know"
389.12,393.36," it was going to get delayed again. Again, right. I think it was supposed to be late March."
394.0,397.76, At the time we wrote that. Right. So not what it's made something. Now it's made 20th. The
397.76,404.0," press release says, uh, fun common ounces a new release date for age of Conan, hi-bory and adventures."
404.0,409.84000000000003," The highly anticipated MMO receives eight more weeks of development, allowing funcon to deliver"
409.91999999999996,415.28, a more polished MMO experience when the game launches on the 20th of May. Despite great feedback on
415.28,422.96," vital aspects like immersion, fun factor and the exciting combat. This is fun factor. It says fun factor."
422.96,426.88, Yeah. The management of funcom has decided to polish the game even more.
428.47999999999996,432.08, Eight weeks is great news. Eight weeks of development work is therefore added the stress game
432.08,437.35999999999996," system, some polished the game further leading up to launch. You know, uh, more importantly for me,"
437.44,444.96000000000004," at least the left or dead was pushed back as well. The was it? Oh, yeah. How long? It's now summer."
444.96000000000004,451.92," His the stated release window. Now it was March, which was unusually specific. Actually,"
451.92,456.96000000000004," this is, this is a good. This is now, I mean, and I was the one who was like, everyone's a"
456.96000000000004,460.40000000000003," command. It's about why you keep saying it's right. You know, it's not. And now I'm always like,"
460.40000000000003,465.84000000000003," okay, I played it and it's so like it's so good and close to being done. Like I can see, I can't"
465.91999999999996,471.03999999999996, imagine I'm not having it done. But their perfectionist and their game has benefited from it.
471.03999999999996,475.76," But at the same time, it's like now, just don't take any. In funcom's case,"
475.76,480.56, or even their previous track record is probably good that they're taking more time.
481.91999999999996,487.03999999999996," If you just go back in history to like the Antarctic online launch, it was one of the early"
487.03999999999996,494.79999999999995," theascos of MML launches, mostly because of its buginess at the time. It was messy. More time here,"
494.88,498.72," but then, of course, it just begs a question, how much do you get out of eight weeks? That's not"
498.72,504.96000000000004, really a long time. You probably scheme a thing. Get polish. The videos get polish. You get more fun.
504.96000000000004,511.2," The factor. They still look pretty bad. They're not. It's an MML. Yeah. I mean,"
511.2,516.4," this is not getting around. It hasn't, it's not any more advanced in terms of like, because I mean,"
516.4,520.64," every MML has the same problem with like, you got a bunch of guys moving around that are making contact"
520.64,527.52, with the error. Let's get the same thing on. It is. It's all very much like dark on and live action
527.52,532.4," role playing. Like there's just this, the bad guy you get the feeling that the bad guy is like,"
533.1999999999999,537.52," all right, I'll be the guy you get hit with the foam, who pretends to get hit with the foam course"
537.52,544.0," or it and dies this time. No, I'm not going to have you reduce a genre that I personally love."
544.0,547.6, I'm not saying that that doesn't mean that the genre is crap. It just means that the combat
547.6,553.36," looks like it's from dark on. Okay. Well, that's true. That's not a bad thing. Depending on,"
554.08,559.36, there's a lot more to this game than clearly of course. And the other big thing today was
559.36,565.36, wow announcing a closer than announcing that wow hit 10 million. 10 million subscribers.
566.5600000000001,571.28, How long have you been took away from nine to ten? It did. I'm supposed to be going up still.
571.28,576.5600000000001," I was expecting like the last announcement to be like, yeah, that's it. Maybe it's going to start"
577.1999999999999,582.64," that's how we made it. That's how we made it. I was like, NPD numbers was that for the PC when"
582.64,587.5999999999999," wow was number two, I think. Because that means people are still buying the original retail box."
587.5999999999999,590.88, Right. That wasn't even burning crusade. What was number one?
593.5999999999999,595.92," Call duty four. Oh, well. Yeah."
598.8,602.8, That's it's been selling well. Yeah. That's all there is to say.
603.76,612.0799999999999," All there is to say. It has been. I like the games. Yeah. No, I don't mean is I'm just saying like"
612.0799999999999,617.28," whatever. I mean, I'm saying I don't care to get into something. No, we don't. We don't play the"
617.28,621.5999999999999," numbers game here. No, I just why we're all glad. I'm glad it's selling well. You know, I mean,"
621.5999999999999,626.8," the infinity word was recently complaining about piracy and you know, probably just five"
626.88,633.52," slightly so people ever gave off, but at the same time, I know that I suspect that it is selling well."
634.24,638.8, I think Call duty four is also mainstream enough of a franchise that there's going to be tons of
638.8,644.0799999999999, people who would be the kind of gamers who do not pirate who would be interested in this
644.0799999999999,653.52," particular title, right? They need to do something about it. It's another problem that specific. It's"
653.52,659.52," I believe specific to PC, but it's more a problem on PC than other platforms, and that's just cheating and whatnot."
659.52,664.52, And the quality of the game has just been played by it ever since the original.
664.52,674.52," Punkbuster for whatever reason, I mean, they update, they handle it all for those of the people that aren't playing through steam and it's by that way."
674.52,680.52," And it's just people's overt, the punkbuster, anti-cheat stuff like on a daily hourly basis."
680.52,697.52," And the game is like, quality before is more tempting than ever to hack because with, since you could shoot through walls, normally being able to see through walls with any kind of wall hack or like glowing skins, champs and stuff they call them."
697.52,703.52," It's tempting and then people just, it's punch, punch, or full shield, if it gets that kind of stuff though."
703.52,710.52," No, not at all. I mean what they'll do is, there's, you know, I know all of this because when I play it, you always suspect someone's cheating."
710.52,719.52," That PC shit's cheating. So you look at the kill cam and you see it and then you go and you're like, peeing everyone always goes, every cheater, no one ever comes out and says, yeah, I'm cheating."
719.52,724.52," You know, right, yeah, always like, and you know what's for every loser, obviously things the other guys cheating though."
724.52,741.52," I've like, like, in my mind, I'm like absolutely positive that I've figured out that leaders of plans and stuff were playing on some clans server and they're supposed to be all some big, you know, massively, you know, known clan and, and it's like, they're fucking admin is total hacker."
741.52,751.52," And they're like, doing the arguments like, dude, there's, it's impossible to hack this game, you can't hack it and like, let me tab out right now and just put in, like, multiplayer, COD4 cheats and see what I get."
751.52,763.52," It's ton of, you go to like, multiplayer cheats dot, you know, DE or whatever is one of the big, how this form you see there's like tons and tons and every day that punkbuster picks one up, like within an hour or so and has a new one."
763.52,778.52," And they're just playing that game. So yeah, I don't, I hope we can get some way around that, but, can we, I couldn't, I wouldn't even, that's such a turnoff right there to even picking it up, there's knowing that."
778.52,784.52," Why would I play that just knowing that how many people on this earth, even one person doing that is ruining it for me."
784.52,785.52, Yeah.
785.52,791.52," Yeah, but it's easy enough to get on a server where people seem to be cool, isn't it? I mean, it's easy to be cool."
791.52,797.52," Yeah, it can. I mean, and it helps if you know admins, if they're active admins in a server and they'll pick it out."
797.52,804.52," If anyone's even, like, slightly blatant about it, they'll just kick you out right away, you know, you see people get kicked and,"
805.52,810.52," Yeah, I don't know. It's just, it's kind of there and it's not like I don't want to, you know, to the finitual guys."
810.52,815.52," I'm going to try to say that their game's the only one that this happens to, but it's like in my experience, this is,"
815.52,819.52," it's just been epidemic, you see, O-D-2, who's the same way."
819.52,827.52," And it's, I mean, it's punkbusters fault, I guess. I mean, that's there's, that's who they're relying on to solve that issue for their game."
827.52,833.52," And, and then, ultimately, it's the fault of the people that do it, you know, I mean, really, that's where the, the blame is, of course,"
833.52,850.52," but, right, well, you know, it's easy enough to, to cheat as you're saying, it's easy enough to get away with it, and it's easy enough to just to fight yourself when you're just sitting at home anonymously behind your screen and nobody knows who the hell you are, you know,"
850.52,855.52, if you're even remotely inclined to do that and don't have a moral issue with it.
855.52,858.52," Yeah, I think he's he gaming makes it pretty easy to do."
858.52,867.52," And anyway, what we know about people, it's human nature to cheat when people believe they can get away with cheating more often than not they do, you know,"
867.52,875.52," cynical view of our species, but I mean, I think, to get a logical experiments about school,"
875.52,882.52," that's the Gachiton school ever kind of depends on the stakes and stuff too, you know, I mean, like I never cheated in school."
882.52,885.52, You never run down vocabulary words on the back of your hand.
885.52,889.52, I don't remember doing that.
889.52,890.52, Did you?
890.52,892.52, Who me?
892.52,893.52, Yeah.
893.52,894.52, What?
894.52,896.52, I did it.
896.52,898.52, I did it one time that I remember.
898.52,899.52, So that's why I'm.
899.52,900.52, Okay.
900.52,905.52, That's why I'm asking because I feel bad.
905.52,907.52, I resigned.
907.52,910.52, You're right now on there for having cheated on her.
910.52,912.52, She's seventh grade English.
912.52,913.52," Well, here's the thing."
913.52,919.52, The teacher had written of vocabulary words and the definitions up on the blackboard.
919.52,923.52, And then we were going to have a test on them that day.
923.52,927.52," And right before the test started, she still hadn't erased them."
927.52,931.52," So people were like, people in the classroom are like giggling and shit because, you know,"
931.52,936.52," she's about to give the test and then, you know, she's like, was everybody laughing about it and, you know, we turned around and showed the toll."
936.52,938.52, The answers were on the blackboard.
938.52,939.52, So she erased it.
939.52,946.52," But before she did that, I like wrote down a few that I hadn't memorized onto, you know, my hand."
946.52,948.52, So I did cheat in that one case.
948.52,950.52," Hey, Ben, you can talk."
950.52,951.52, We can still remember that.
951.52,952.52," Oh, sure."
952.52,953.52, I sure.
953.52,954.52, Of course I remember that.
954.52,955.52, I just feel really guilty.
955.52,956.52, I do.
956.52,957.52, It haunts me to this day.
957.52,963.52," I apologize to, uh, Milliken Junior High School in Vanice, California, for I'm cheated on that."
963.52,964.52," Oh, okay."
965.52,966.52," Oh, okay."
966.52,979.52," I want to ask you guys about something else up and thinking about this weekend and answered as honestly as he can because it relates to the stuff I'm thinking about about the piracy, the call duty for and the crisis stuff that we went over a little bit before."
979.52,989.52, And that is what is your take on and your actions regarding music downloading piracy.
990.52,991.52," Oh, shut it."
991.52,993.52, It's onto make it faces.
993.52,995.52, And whether you think it's relevant.
995.52,996.52," Oh, God."
996.52,1004.52," It should be that that right there examining my own, uh, I should have some sort of cognitive dissonance here."
1004.52,1006.52, But I know it's like I don't.
1006.52,1007.52," You know, it's weird."
1007.52,1011.52," Like I will get out and was like, if like I can get an album four months before it comes out."
1011.52,1015.52," And I mean, I'm very particular about the types of music I listen to."
1015.52,1018.52, So I will go and buy the stuff when I when it does is made available.
1018.52,1024.52," Um, but yeah, it's tempting when it's one of your favorite artists and you can hear it four months before it's out."
1024.52,1033.52," And, but it's like at the same time, I've never ever think of pirating a game in any way shape, you know, in any form of shape fashion."
1033.52,1035.52," And it's like, why is that difference there?"
1035.52,1037.52, Is it because it's a higher price for that one?
1037.52,1038.52, And I don't think so.
1038.52,1040.52, Maybe it's just because I work in the business.
1040.52,1041.52, I don't know.
1041.52,1042.52, What is that?
1042.52,1045.52, Do you think it would be more tempting to you if you didn't work in the business?
1045.52,1047.52, Do you have to pay for every purchase of?
1047.52,1048.52," No, maybe it would."
1048.52,1053.52," Yeah, I mean, like, say if you were someone and you're like, hey, you can get crisis in a week before you've been waiting for two years for it."
1053.52,1054.52, And you get to play it.
1054.52,1056.52," And then you tell yourself, oh, by that one, it comes out."
1056.52,1057.52, And then you already beat it.
1057.52,1058.52, And then you don't know.
1058.52,1059.52, Yeah.
1059.52,1063.52," That's why I do have to make a point of like, or, you know, ordering pre-ordering this, the CDs that I."
1063.52,1066.52," Now, then get this year on ethics."
1066.52,1067.52, Yeah.
1067.52,1068.52," What about you, Sean?"
1068.52,1072.52, Haven't downloaded music in a long time.
1072.52,1076.52," But if somebody else someone will say, hey, I got this in my folder."
1076.52,1077.52," No, be like, okay, listen to that."
1077.52,1080.52," You wouldn't just go, I really shouldn't do that."
1080.52,1081.52," No, no, no."
1081.52,1085.52," There's the other thing too, like, I mean, it's all, I don't know."
1085.52,1086.52, It's hard.
1086.52,1088.52, It's all more of a equivocation and excuse making.
1088.52,1092.52," You're like, you all recommend something to you, Jeff."
1092.52,1094.52," No, I know I have the CD at home."
1094.52,1095.52, Right.
1095.52,1100.52," But I can just get it in like two minutes, you know, in some, or I have it, like an iPod or something."
1100.52,1103.52," You've given me some things recently, and I've taken them."
1103.52,1104.52, Right.
1104.52,1105.52, You gave me the last.
1105.52,1106.52, You have all of those.
1106.52,1108.52, I have the CDs for.
1108.52,1109.52, Right.
1109.52,1111.52," But that doesn't mean I, I don't know."
1111.52,1114.52, I guess you could legally make a copy of the CD.
1114.52,1115.52, Right.
1115.52,1118.52," Well, difference is what happens every time you talk about piracy, though."
1118.52,1122.52," Instead of it just being this, you know, you wanted to be sort of black and white issue,"
1122.52,1125.52," but it's all like, if nearly you spend in gray area."
1125.52,1126.52, Mm-hmm.
1126.52,1129.52," Well, that's why I'm bringing it up because it is a tough issue."
1129.52,1134.52," I mean, I definitely fall in line up that I think it's a horrible thing."
1134.52,1138.52," In PC gaming, and yet I can look on my own iPod and probably find it good."
1138.52,1140.52, I don't know.
1140.52,1147.52," Most, you know, the grand majority of stuff is stuff that I paid money for, like a good 96% at least."
1147.52,1152.52," But there's whatever 10, 20 albums on there that I got from folks around,"
1152.52,1155.52," want to, that weren't mine, you know."
1155.52,1159.52," I never actually went to a download site to, you know,"
1159.52,1163.52, I never actively sought out CDs to pirate.
1163.52,1165.52, But it's on land on your lap.
1165.52,1166.52," You're like, well, right."
1166.52,1168.52," But if someone says, hey, I got the new shins, you want it."
1168.52,1169.52," And you'd be like, I wouldn't have bought it."
1169.52,1171.52, So sure why not?
1171.52,1175.52," Right. Now, in some cases, if I felt guilty enough, and it is, say, an indie band,"
1175.52,1179.52, then I will try to go out and supplement it if I like it.
1179.52,1182.52," That's kind of the thing, too, I think, where the guilt plays a part is when you,"
1182.52,1188.52," for me, they are bands, and I know they sell very, very few copies of the albums they make."
1188.52,1190.52," And it's kind of the same way with PC where you're like, well,"
1190.52,1193.52, do you want to keep playing PC games?
1193.52,1195.52, Then don't fucking steal them.
1195.52,1197.52, And it's the same way for some people.
1197.52,1200.52," It's like, if it's a case of like some major artists or something,"
1200.52,1201.52, it doesn't matter.
1201.52,1204.52," They're making a profit no matter what, but if you,"
1204.52,1208.52," I'm just kind of, again, playing doubles advocate on this one with the way I think that people"
1208.52,1213.52," make different excuses depending on the specifics of each case, you know."
1213.52,1218.52," And you're like, well, you personally feel like, yeah, you, you like this artist,"
1218.52,1223.52," and you're just guaranteeing that they're going to have to do twice as many shows to live shows,"
1223.52,1225.52, to put food on their table.
1225.52,1226.52, Right.
1226.52,1227.52, Then you feel like a shithead about it.
1227.52,1230.52," And the same with PC, you're like, it's really to the point."
1230.52,1234.52," If everyone continues to do this shit, like, no one is going to spend,"
1234.52,1241.52, it's not going to be cost effective to spend all that money on your budget to make this game.
1241.52,1242.52, Right.
1242.52,1243.52, Right.
1243.52,1245.52, The majority of people can go fucking taking for free.
1245.52,1246.52, Right.
1246.52,1247.52, Yeah.
1247.52,1251.52," You know, I just, I got a trial subscription to emusic.com."
1251.52,1252.52, Have you heard of this site?
1252.52,1254.52," Because what they do, I'm not pinpin' it."
1254.52,1255.52, You music.
1255.52,1258.52," And I'm just laughing, because it sounds like such a grandpa thing."
1258.52,1259.52, Have you heard about e-mix?
1259.52,1262.52, Have you heard about electronic mail?
1262.52,1263.52, Yeah.
1263.52,1266.52, You can type messages now and send them all the information.
1266.52,1267.52, Super highway.
1267.52,1273.52," The title is something like, yeah, e-mix sounds like one of the first sites ever because they all hit me."
1273.52,1274.52, Yeah.
1274.52,1275.52, That's true.
1275.52,1276.52, It actually does go way back.
1276.52,1280.52, But I got turned on to it by the quarter to three gang.
1280.52,1285.52," And they, their model is really interesting, because you're paying 10, well, there's different models."
1285.52,1288.52, But like the one that I'm sent up for it's 10 bucks a month.
1288.52,1294.52," And for $10, you get 30 downloads a month."
1294.52,1299.52," So that's, you know, on average, 3 CDs a month."
1299.52,1300.52, Yeah.
1300.52,1307.52," Which, to me, seems ridiculously cheap, almost at the point of almost being wrong somehow."
1307.52,1310.52, Like how are the artists I can't figure it out?
1310.52,1311.52, Because I can't figure it out.
1311.52,1312.52, Because I can't figure it out anyway.
1312.52,1313.52, Yeah.
1313.52,1315.52," I mean, that's kind of what's going to steal."
1315.52,1316.52," If you're like, it's a very old hit."
1316.52,1318.52," Five cents for it, then to get nothing."
1318.52,1320.52," So, right, you had to have it with the last album."
1320.52,1322.52," And they're just like, you know, you're probably going to download it."
1322.52,1324.52, Give you a chance to pay for it if you want.
1324.52,1329.52, Or that's what was so ridiculous about continuing to charge 18 bucks for a CD as long as they did.
1329.52,1330.52, Yeah.
1330.52,1337.52, To the point when the majority of people who were previously buying the most CDs were the ones that were had the best access to the free ones.
1337.52,1338.52, Right.
1338.52,1341.52," Well, we all like radio ad here except that on about Ryan."
1341.52,1342.52, Do you know who they are?
1342.52,1343.52, Yeah.
1343.52,1346.52, We're going to be dead.
1346.52,1347.52, We're going to be dead.
1347.52,1348.52, I'm not going to be dead.
1348.52,1350.52," They're like, we're a more hateful."
1350.52,1351.52, Much of a number.
1351.52,1354.52," Do you feel like they're the, they're rich motherfuckers."
1354.52,1356.52," So like, you know, yeah, they can get away with it."
1356.52,1361.52," Okay, but did any of us like I paid a little money for in rainbows?"
1361.52,1362.52, I did.
1362.52,1363.52, Thank you.
1363.52,1366.52, I'm not saying that like I'm better than you because I didn't pay that much.
1366.52,1368.52, I think I paid a little bit.
1368.52,1376.52," I paid zero because I was going to my plan again was to buy the physical one because I still collect it, you know, physical media of things I wanted to buy the disk box or even at least this CD."
1376.52,1377.52, That was my thought.
1377.52,1379.52, I doubt that's going to happen.
1379.52,1382.52, But at the time I entered zero pounds and check out.
1382.52,1383.52, So.
1383.52,1390.52, And I think they released the study that said like 66% of the people who downloaded it didn't pay anything.
1390.52,1391.52," Oh, wow."
1391.52,1394.52, I think that's what the actual final stats were.
1394.52,1395.52, That's true.
1395.52,1396.52, That's not.
1396.52,1399.52," I mean, you can't be surprised by that, right?"
1399.52,1400.52, It's just a note.
1400.52,1401.52, Would you like this one?
1401.52,1402.52, Or would you like to pay?
1402.52,1403.52, So she loves cooks for you.
1403.52,1404.52," But you know, yeah."
1404.52,1406.52, But don't you think.
1406.52,1407.52, I don't know.
1407.52,1409.52, Do we have a topic?
1409.52,1410.52," Yeah, plenty."
1410.52,1411.52, I can make it a lot.
1411.52,1415.52," I mean, we, we have some other point right in this very conversation that we've delivered from"
1415.52,1418.52, First Second about game in Asia when you brought up radio head.
1418.52,1420.52, You seem to be making some point.
1420.52,1421.52, I did on that.
1421.52,1422.52, Let's rewind.
1422.52,1424.52, I don't remember.
1424.52,1426.52," Well, let's talk about this news."
1426.52,1431.52, Just came out yesterday and the image of our next cover for battlefield heroes.
1431.52,1435.52, This was the game that I was alluding to over the past few weeks.
1435.52,1438.52, And about how excited I am to talk about it.
1438.52,1442.52," And unfortunately, I still can't say much because, you know, we don't want to scoop our magazine."
1442.52,1451.52," So as soon as the magazine does, you know, start hitting subscribers and stuff then I'll be able to have a thorough discussion of it on the podcast."
1451.52,1454.52, But it's been interesting to see the reactions.
1454.52,1457.52, And we could talk about that certainly right now.
1457.52,1458.52, Right.
1458.52,1460.52, I guess if people don't know and haven't seen the news.
1460.52,1461.52, And it's frustrating.
1461.52,1462.52, It's frustrating.
1462.52,1463.52, Basically what it is.
1463.52,1464.52, Okay.
1464.52,1467.52, So EA basically announced that their next battlefield
1467.52,1473.52, game called battlefield heroes is going to be entirely free to play.
1473.52,1478.52, That they will that they expect to make a profit on it through advertising.
1478.52,1481.52, None of which will appear in the game itself.
1481.52,1486.52," In other words, you're not going to be playing the game and looking at ads on the walls or even ads on billboards."
1486.52,1489.52, Like we're in Battlefield 2042.
1489.52,1493.52, All advertising is going to be hosted on the page that you access the game in.
1494.52,1497.52, And then in the social network and community that's surrounding it.
1497.52,1499.52, That's really interesting.
1499.52,1500.52, The options that they have in there.
1500.52,1503.52," But again, I don't think I can go into depth about it right now."
1503.52,1504.52, Please.
1504.52,1505.52, Soon.
1505.52,1508.52, And then the possibility of micro transactions.
1508.52,1510.52," And again, they."
1510.52,1517.52, Clare five publicly clarified that this isn't going to be a matter of the rich buying their way to victory over and over again.
1517.52,1520.52, You buying the best guns and vehicles and weapons.
1521.52,1532.52," And so one of the, you know, not only is it interesting to sort of watch people respond to it, but it's frustrating that you see a lot of these just serious misconceptions about how the thing is going to work."
1532.52,1534.52," You want to jump in and go, no, actually it doesn't."
1534.52,1536.52, It's not like that at all.
1536.52,1540.52," So again, you got to wait on it, but it's definitely not the case."
1540.52,1543.52," From what I know and from what I've seen, yeah, don't worry."
1543.52,1545.52, Jeff's not going to buy himself.
1546.52,1554.52, Whatever a V1 rocket dropping on your guys at base because he wanted to spend 20 dollars in battlefield funny money.
1554.52,1556.52," But you guys, I weren't willing to."
1556.52,1558.52, We're willing to spend.
1558.52,1559.52," Yeah, we."
1559.52,1560.52, Right.
1560.52,1564.52, And this isn't we're not trying to be obnoxious with that we will discuss it in depth when we can.
1564.52,1566.52," Yeah, so I would love to now."
1566.52,1568.52, It's like I just don't we make a magazine too.
1568.52,1571.52, And that's what pays our rent and we need to sell that magazine.
1571.52,1573.52, So we got to let that story come out.
1573.52,1575.52, I'm actually fairly certain even if we wanted to.
1575.52,1578.52, I don't think we were I think we might still be in Bogot.
1578.52,1584.52," So okay, right, but other things that we, you know, we could talk about because they were in the announcement of the game."
1584.52,1586.52," Um,"
1586.52,1589.52," Are, well, the style, right, right."
1589.52,1594.52, There was they between our cover image and then the one image of a character.
1594.52,1596.52, Everyone's immediately responding.
1596.52,1599.52," Oh my god, they ripped off team fortress two."
1599.52,1602.52, And that's another take and like this kind of cartoonie.
1602.52,1606.52," I think that's a, that's another real style interesting discussion to have."
1606.52,1609.52, I guess of course I asked him it's great too.
1609.52,1612.52," Because like, yeah, I mean, we, we, all the stuff is covered in depth in the story."
1612.52,1615.52," But as far as I could say now, think about it this way."
1615.52,1623.52," Team fortress two ended up looking the way it does because it, and it always been this game where, you know,"
1623.52,1628.52, Ridiculous stuff guys using grenades to propel themselves across a bridge.
1628.52,1636.52, And that's about 20 yards long and separates bases that are existing this random world where it's nothing but a red base and a blue base facing one another.
1636.52,1638.52," And they said, what do we do with this to make sense of it?"
1638.52,1641.52, We've had that discussion before similarly with battlefield.
1641.52,1644.52," It's been the game where, you know, you can wing walk."
1644.52,1649.52," If you want someone to someone's already flying the plane, but you want to get across the map quickly."
1649.52,1652.52, You jump on the wing and lay down and he flies you.
1652.52,1655.52, You throw T and T in the back of your Jeep.
1655.52,1659.52, Try that into the enemy jump out and blow that up where you put T and T on the ground.
1659.52,1662.52, Drive over it and have an ally hit the plunger on it.
1662.52,1666.52," Right as you're going up a hill and that way you launch, you can, and the original battlefield 42."
1666.52,1676.52," It always changed throughout the patches, but there were things where you could jump a Jeep off of like wake island on to an aircraft carrier out to see off the shore, you know."
1676.52,1678.52, And it's never been a sim game.
1678.52,1680.52, It's never been armed to solve.
1680.52,1684.52," It's not, you know, like forgotten hope or any of these other red orchestra."
1685.52,1690.52," And it's like, let, what happens when you, let's take this and run with it and know that this is crazy."
1690.52,1695.52, It's always been like fundamentally cartoony in the way that players dealt with it.
1695.52,1698.52, Another old habit that was patched out.
1698.52,1702.52," They always have to decide what they want to embrace and what they want to remove is people were like,"
1702.52,1704.52," Hey, you get hit with the tank shell or something."
1704.52,1707.52," It doesn't kill you on impact, but it throws you 40 feet in the sky."
1707.52,1710.52," And when you land and when you hit the ground, you're going to die."
1710.52,1712.52, And then they start popping their parachutes.
1712.52,1715.52," So it's like, you know, someone drops a bomb on you."
1715.52,1718.52, You see you 10 guys fly and five of them hit their parachutes.
1718.52,1719.52, And land out of it.
1719.52,1721.52," They still take some damage, but they don't die."
1721.52,1723.52," And it's like, that's totally fun."
1723.52,1724.52, Do you want to get rid of that?
1724.52,1725.52, Because it's not realistic.
1725.52,1726.52, Right.
1726.52,1728.52," Do you want to, or because of balance issues,"
1728.52,1730.52," or do you want to say, hey, actually, let's do that."
1730.52,1731.52, Right.
1731.52,1736.52," So you're saying that it's a song we're saying both independently, you know,"
1736.52,1740.52, arrived at the position of our game is not realistic from the start.
1740.52,1742.52, So let's just cartoon it up.
1742.52,1743.52, And let's take it to the extreme.
1743.52,1745.52," Dice is original stuff like codename, eagle and stuff."
1745.52,1749.52, It's always been a part of the company's thinking.
1749.52,1750.52, Mm-hmm.
1750.52,1752.52," Again, without, you know, printing the story, I could say that."
1752.52,1755.52," That it's, it's not a case where."
1755.52,1759.52," And again, I'm not going to just defend this game because we got the exclusive on it."
1759.52,1765.52," I'm, I'm slightly committed to being like objective and giving my response to the game in the story as someone who's been."
1765.52,1771.52, A battlefield fan for as long as the series has been around and what I am genuinely taking from it.
1771.52,1772.52, How I'm reacting from it.
1772.52,1775.52," But that's one of those things where it's like, I do see that."
1775.52,1778.52, I do see that that style makes sense for the game.
1778.52,1781.52, A cartoonist style makes sense for for some version of the game.
1781.52,1786.52," Because again, this is not battlefield three, which, uh, I believe, which they're still making."
1786.52,1787.52, Mm-hmm.
1787.52,1792.52," Um, the other thing is just the whole like inspiration and imitation thing is always difficult."
1792.52,1795.52," Because you go, I mean, you know, UT3, right?"
1795.52,1796.52," I mean, always looked like, do."
1796.52,1800.52," I mean, the way that the characters are and stuff and it gets to this point where you're like,"
1800.52,1804.52," whatever, you know, I mean, people are seeing squished tanks on the cover and they're saying,"
1804.52,1806.52," Oh, well, that's a total rip off of the Italian wars."
1806.52,1811.52," But it's like, well, metal slug was squishing tanks proportionally well before the Italian wars."
1811.52,1816.52," And other things before metal slug that part of a tradition that metal slugs actually drawn from, you know,"
1816.52,1824.52," with just super-to-form jeopardized series and things like, you know, SF3D and machine and Krieger even had some of that aesthetic."
1824.52,1827.52," Um, well, I'll go even one further."
1827.52,1833.52," Let's say, let's say that EA didn't even come up with battlefield heroes until after TF2 came out,"
1833.52,1834.52, which we know is not true.
1834.52,1838.52, We know the development history that there was some simultaneous stuff going on.
1838.52,1839.52, But let's say that it was.
1839.52,1843.52," Even if that was the case, NEA just said, boy, that TF2 sure is popular,"
1844.52,1846.52, let's make our own and let's make it free.
1846.52,1848.52, I would still say that's awesome.
1848.52,1852.52," I mean, as long as the game is good, like you can go ahead and be inspired,"
1852.52,1855.52," barbed at thing, if you can do your own good job on it."
1855.52,1858.52," And the very fact, again, that this is free,"
1858.52,1861.52," and that it's not battlefield three, means,"
1861.52,1866.52," I mean, me personally, just as a gamer, I'm willing to give this thing the better the doubt."
1866.52,1867.52," Yeah, the start."
1867.52,1868.52, But the wrong way.
1868.52,1869.52, Point.
1869.52,1870.52," That's, go, Sean."
1871.52,1876.52," Yeah, I think that's 10 to key, because I'm not, I'm not one even, like, really care about the battlefield so much."
1876.52,1877.52," Seriously, so much."
1877.52,1885.52," Like, I was kind of into the idea of 20, 20, 142 just because it didn't take place in Cold War 2 or, you know, the usual setting."
1885.52,1887.52, We've had this discussion with us.
1887.52,1888.52," Oh, there's World War 2 again."
1888.52,1893.52," Yeah, really for me, it was like, oh, science fiction setting is just more aesthetically appealing to me."
1893.52,1896.52," And then I heard it kind of was crap, so then I didn't bother."
1897.52,1902.52," But this one, because it's free, and because it's got that more, you know, accessible look to it."
1902.52,1905.52, I'm thinking we'll end up giving it a shot.
1905.52,1910.52," Right. The huge point about that, the, the fact that it's free is that you can try and see for yourself."
1910.52,1916.52," So it's kind of, I was about to say alarming, it's more disconcerting for me to see."
1916.52,1919.52, There's so many people just dismissing it all together.
1919.52,1925.52," Like, oh, this is the, the game version of the crappy music series that come for free and tabloid magazines."
1925.52,1930.52," You know, and right, this is also the online community. So of course, there's a reaction negative."
1930.52,1933.52, But the fact that the new game that looks like shit.
1933.52,1942.52," Because it's free and it runs on, it'll like, you know, again, I can't announce the system sex, but it chances are it's going to run on your computer."
1942.52,1950.52," You could just see for yourself. That's the, the, the story, you know, just like you, you're like, hey, even if it doesn't strike me as being the coolest thing ever."
1950.52,1958.52, You could find yourself in the circumstance where you can at least try and then the game has the option of winning you over making you a fan that way.
1958.52,1979.52," And that's the key point about being free for me because a lot of times I don't agree that like because something comes without a charge is like a get out of criticism pass, you know, a lot of times when people are ripping on our podcasts or something defender step in and you know, bless them for, for defending us, but I don't agree with their defense when they're like, it's free shut up because it's like, no."
1979.52,1992.52," You know, cable TV or network TV shows are free and some of them suck and they can say that doesn't mean that they're like free from from criticism and then anything else that costs money."
1992.52,2006.52," Tons of stuff. I've had it happen. I've been playing mods and you know, if you're having a discussion with people in the game as you're playing, people will shut the fuck up. It's free. It's a mod. You always have that discussion. It's like, well, it's costing people their time. That's the thing."
2006.52,2010.52," Right. And time is money. Sun, someone bring up back to that."
2010.52,2023.52," We know, but you're costing people time. That's that's frogs right there. And it's hooking me up. Rock it, grab it, rock it, rock it, rap it, rib it, like, frabbit."
2023.52,2035.52," So it is costing your time, but that's the thing. Accessibility and what's so cool about this format for me is that you can be in any kind of community."
2035.52,2051.52," You can sort of like be have your instant message window window open and you know, the usual people you talk to you. You can be in a ventrilo server, which is cool for me. I've been doing that more and more. We have just this dedicated events server. We go in and there's always a group of us in there. And we all might be in there. Some of us might be in there."
2051.52,2062.52," And then you can just spontaneously say, you know, what are we going to do right now? What are we going to play? And when the game is free like that, you know, we've been playing like second life in this other playing second life."
2063.52,2074.52," Because you can just say, hey, let's do it. Everyone can download it in five seconds. Everyone can play and it's not a matter of like, well, so and so doesn't have the latest expansion or so and so doesn't have this game."
2074.52,2091.52," And this is exactly the kind of game that can pick up an audience that way because you know, you're having these discussions and all of a sudden, instead of arguing about whether or not it sucks without having played it. You just say, hey, let's all, you know, you being the people in the message border wherever your my space group Facebook just said, let's just go do this right now."
2091.52,2105.52, And really he is picking this idea up from some of these games that have been doing that already the cart writers and some of the other Korean games that have already pretty successfully experimented with this model.
2105.52,2115.52," And, and you know, it's a free download that can download the line lead to purchases whether a little or a lot over time."
2116.52,2144.52," But our like television, you know, like a show like loss or something right again, these are going to be part of the way that the game gets you to come back is it means that they know that the makers of the content because they're not just selling you something at one point making their money and that's it need to satisfy you enough so that you get other people to want to buy and then when they make a sequel you come back, but on such a regular basis that you're going to come and see the ads right the way that lost or battle star or the wires and"
2144.52,2154.52," something hook you and you know where you're ready to come back every week and this game is going to have to do something like that too and that just again, it's going to be changing a lot."
2154.52,2159.52," It's going to be expanding a whole lot if it's provided that it has an audience, you know."
2159.52,2170.52," I remember when the the next on folks were here showing cart writer way back and unfortunately I just don't remember the number, but I ask them, you know, over time like what is a percentage of people who"
2170.52,2190.52," who spend money on the downloads versus just played for free and the number was tiny, you know, it was a tiny percentage, but I asked them if that was enough to run the game and make them a profit and in fact the answer was yes that it does take my ads on their side as well too, right?"
2190.52,2204.52," And then I think, yeah, you've got, yeah, Maple story and Reinscape and all these other, you know, other games are from, you know, some of those are from like Reinscape, you know, from UK, but in the rest there, they big and create or made and create."
2204.52,2226.52," And so just from hearing them talk about that, you know, my my feeling without knowing because you're the one who did the story, I mean I read what you wrote, but I don't, I don't know the details that didn't make it in or whatever, but my understanding is that EA might entirely believe in their business model that most people are probably never going to buy something associated with battlefield heroes ever, right?"
2226.52,2236.52," And they don't care, you know, and they'll still be providing content new content all the time and I don't know, I'm now, I sound like I'm defending the game too, which I'm not."
2236.52,2249.52," I've seen it, it may turn out that it absolutely sucks, but it's a stage we're being charitable because I haven't seen anything that's made me believe that's leading me to suspect that it really will suck."
2249.52,2253.52," Well, I think we're being charitable because, you know, it's a huge announcement."
2253.52,2264.52," This is, you know, one of the two biggest game publishers, right, in the United States announcing that a major game franchise is coming out with a free game."
2264.52,2276.52," So I think the, the nasirs are saying, Nages because they do associate it immediately with something like, make a story or Reinscape, or Carc Raider, all these other ones that just like Carcara gamers don't touch."
2276.52,2278.52, But there's not much of a game there.
2278.52,2280.52," Yeah, they just know what it is."
2280.52,2283.52," And it's like, oh, it's probably maple story for battlefield."
2283.52,2286.52," And yeah, I don't even know what that would be if that's what it is."
2286.52,2288.52, It's a free flash version of battlefield.
2288.52,2293.52," I think that's probably the basic assumption, even though they haven't seen anything in action."
2293.52,2296.52, I pretty much have only seen an art style on a logo.
2296.52,2299.52, It'll be interesting to see how well these do.
2299.52,2303.52," I'm kind of thinking they're going to be really, they're going to go really well."
2303.52,2310.52, For the same reasons that like counter strike blew up to the extent that it did is that I mean it was a free mod.
2310.52,2317.52, And for a base game that was cheap and that would run on like a very wide range of of rigs.
2317.52,2325.52," And word of, you know, word of mouth would spread so rapidly and it would be that much easier to get people into the games and playing with you."
2325.52,2328.52," And all the, I mean, there's, there's tons of potential for that."
2328.52,2332.52, And the same reason that it is pursuing it with their browser-based quake game.
2332.52,2347.52," You know, so it'll be fascinating to see if all of a sudden the most played PC games there, they're rather than gunning for, you know, system specs for two years from now, three years from now."
2347.52,2355.52," They're, they wanted their game to run on the laptops that everyone already has the ones that they got that they didn't buy to be gaming computers."
2355.52,2358.52," But, you know, right."
2358.52,2377.52," So I, while just had 10 millions of credits. Right. Yeah. That actually reminds me that I, I finally installed crisis this weekend after reading the post about, you know, about system specs not being, you know, about it being a bit of a myth."
2377.52,2378.52, Right.
2378.52,2386.52," So I wanted to see because I have a fairly low end rig low end, well, not really. I mean, let me say."
2386.52,2413.52," What do you have? Let me say that there's an 8800 GT in there. Okay. You're calling that low end, but the, but the processor though is is a low end processor is it's it's a few years old. I had to install and then uninstall this to itself because this to my machine could not handle this to weird. Yeah. So, so, you know, that's that's the kind of rig it is and can start and crisis when I ran the,"
2414.52,2440.52," the, what's it called? You know, the automatic determine the best settings for me thing. Yeah. It said low. Okay. So that's where it was at. And so the resolution was 800 by 600 every, every effect was on low and I went in and, you know, it looked pretty bad. Yeah. And I went back and I up the rest to 10 24 by,"
2441.52,2460.52," 768. Thank you. So, and I put a bunch of the settings on medium. I kept the ones that I knew we're going to crash. We're going to be a problem like shadowing it low and I went back in and it significantly made it better like it made it. So it was like, okay, I'm now playing a relatively current generation shooter."
2460.52,2468.52," I mean, it certainly looks nothing like what I saw on the how it was like here. That point. What about the fifth. It was fine that the frame rate was fine."
2468.52,2474.52," Did you get into get to the part in the game where you're at least, you know, driving trucks through Shax and drawing grenades."
2474.52,2488.52," Yeah, so I could do all that. It looked fine. The only real problem I was having was the redraw rate. Just, you know, rocks were appearing like four feet in front of me all the sudden as I was coming to them. So that kind of sucked."
2489.52,2503.52," But it was remarkable to me at that it was so well, it was playing so well at that setting. I mean, again, it didn't look great. Like the stuff that this, that the game got mostly touted for in terms of its eye candy."
2503.52,2514.52," I was largely missing out on and I know I'm missing out on them because I've seen it running extremely well. I was like, I'm playing a different game than that game, right? But I could still play this game."
2514.52,2516.52, I don't know. I think that does kind of defeat the purpose.
2516.52,2523.52," See, it's not saying that the game is just as graphics. The graphics are very, very important to the game."
2523.52,2530.52," Well, I would say, and that's what I was going to say next though was I'm only a few hours in and a few hours in though."
2530.52,2538.52," If this was all this game was, if I hadn't seen it, seen it at its potential at a higher level, I might have wondered what the big deal was about here."
2538.52,2545.52," Yeah, because it's certainly story wise and stuff like that. It is not knocking me off my feet so far. What is?"
2545.52,2549.52," I want to say, I managed to think so we can talk about the story. Yeah, well, I've got a way to go."
2549.52,2551.52," Oh, my God."
2551.52,2553.52, I'm committed to finishing.
2553.52,2554.52, I'm committed to finishing.
2554.52,2562.52," Like the, it only takes a little bit graphics wise to like break the illusion entirely for me. Like you're just talking about the redrawed or since if you're rocks."
2562.52,2567.52," Like if you had picked everything up and still had to drop that slider down, that's all that I would notice."
2567.52,2574.52," It's like, man, those rocks are probably just being aware of how much better it could be and how much better it could be and how much better it should be."
2574.52,2583.52," It's quite distracting. It's like what's going by as a new car owner, my friend in college, he got himself like some bolts wag or something."
2583.52,2588.52," And then someone pointed out that it just had like stock wheels on it, you know, like the hub caps."
2588.52,2595.52, And then it's like he was all he went from being so excited about his new car and like thinking about nothing other than the fact that he didn't have wheels.
2595.52,2603.52," So he had a hub caps and like then he went and got the, you know, eventually went and got the wheels and we're like, why'd you do that? You couldn't afford the cars it was."
2603.52,2615.52," Yeah, well, there is something just concerning that even though my processor is fairly well that I do have two gigs of RAM and an 80, 800 and it's still telling me you should play this in the low."
2615.52,2618.52," You know, it is a little reversal."
2618.52,2619.52, Disgusting.
2619.52,2620.52, Our future machine.
2620.52,2622.52, Yeah.
2622.52,2635.52," And it will, though, to be fair, it will. I think that it's, it's a game that all the sales will have legs and it will continue to sell because every time someone upgrades their computer and get something they'll look, oh, that's the game I'll get know."
2635.52,2641.52, Tell you something else I've found about it is it seems a little hard to me.
2641.52,2644.52," Yeah, it is actually the, what are you playing in the night?"
2644.52,2645.52, I think the guy playing in a normal.
2645.52,2657.52," I had this problem at first that the guy's take depending on the circumstances and circumstances being your, your distance from the enemy, the weapon you're firing, you know, the position you're firing from all these things."
2657.52,2660.52, It could take far too many shots to kill people.
2660.52,2661.52, And that was there.
2661.52,2664.52, That complaint was there from the demo they had.
2664.52,2674.52, It was hilarious because there was someone from the Dan Stapleton from PC gamer put up a video and it was like super defensive like maybe I'm just a god at FES.
2674.52,2684.52, Or like what's wrong and and he's like here's a video to demonstrate that how easy it is to kill people. So what he did was you made a video of the first three guys that appear in the game.
2684.52,2692.52," You know, when you after you you crash land and not and a little tutorial and how to crawl or crouch through the crouch."
2692.52,2697.52, The little grotto and then see three guys there and those are all guys are like single shot kills no matter what you know.
2697.52,2702.52," So it's kind of like if someone were telling you that, you know, maybe the battle with all my ninja guidance too hard."
2702.52,2706.52, So the preview wrong someone took a video of like the first enemy you fight in in this.
2706.52,2709.52," It was pretty silly, but yeah, I think there's a problem with that."
2709.52,2717.52, It sometimes it'll even happen. I couldn't understand exactly why but with like a shotgun at near point blank range to right to center mass.
2717.52,2726.52," And well, I was noticing the same problem that I had with Far Cry, which is the dudes noticing you from way too far away and reacting to you."
2726.52,2732.52," You know, seeing you when reacting to you and shooting at you when it seems like there's no way they possibly could have."
2732.52,2736.52," I mean, the bug me back in that game and I noticed it here. It didn't bug me as much."
2736.52,2741.52," They're still dead. They're always circumstances like that and that's I mean, that's nothing."
2741.52,2745.52, I felt like harping on them for because it's yeah.
2745.52,2750.52, That is the most difficult thing to do in the shooter any kind of anytime you introduce stealth into a game.
2750.52,2754.52," Right. And that's the difference between, you know, Kojima in the Metal Gear games."
2754.52,2764.52," They say, well, we'll show you some physical approximation in the way that characters are looking around it, but it's mainly just it's just going to be a diagram and that's going to appear in your map."
2764.52,2771.52," Characters are either they walked around. They're aware of you or they're not aware of you and that's just kind of determined by you know, right."
2771.52,2781.52," We're going to like, we're just going to bullshit it. You know, whereas like the splinter cell games, they've always tried to communicate it just through the world."
2781.52,2786.52, And it's always stood out as being I think more annoying in the splinter cell games.
2786.52,2796.52," And again, this I should even have to make this disclaimer, but when I talk about there being something annoying in the games, I mean, I don't like the game because I love this winter cell games a lot of Metal Gear games."
2796.52,2801.52," Okay, you still have those moments like do you have the same thing in the song me, right?"
2801.52,2810.52," But yeah, you have this or he should have seen this. You're like, what the fuck dude, like that guy just all of a sudden just snapped around and you and you figure out you're like, yes, there's like the here's where the trip wires."
2810.52,2820.52," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I found those in in crisis, there were a few times when I did whatever I could to sneak around and it's like boom, then you're like, that's the exact trip."
2820.52,2825.52," You'll ill, the larm will be the moment you go here right for the most part though when I played that game."
2825.52,2833.52, I didn't have that and the cloaking is what made it tolerable right because I would immediately sort of turn them back to their.
2834.52,2841.52," Because all these games have it both Metal Gear though, it has an actual timer and it will show you the timer before they return to it and stay."
2841.52,2855.52," Splinter cell has the thing where it's that you hear in alarm go off, you know, and then they return to it and then the old ones was really bad though, actually because they would just if you set the alarm three times like splitter cell to do just end the mission."
2855.52,2864.52," We just be. Oh, yeah, I remember that was fucking ready. Yeah, and you need you need the reset even though it's like the most unrealistic thing in the world like they saw you they're not going to like after 30 seconds go."
2864.52,2867.52," Oh, I'm just going to go back to the kitchen and do what I was doing before."
2867.52,2872.52," Yeah, but I really stick to pull the plug on you when you're when you're detected because it's okay, you're this guy."
2872.52,2880.52, You're operating sort of outside official government sanction and you're dropped you're like in like some on clay and you know Thailand or something.
2880.52,2894.52," And because you get detected you guys like fuck it whatever. Yeah, you're going to like you're going to do what you have to right. Yeah, I know to set in in crisis even is it when I would stealth and that you know the trigger would basically go off and the guy would just go."
2894.52,2899.52," Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I'm crawling around your base, but you get."
2899.52,2905.52, I see what's funny is the videos you look when they there are because they'll they can't swim the enemy.
2905.52,2911.52," You can lure him into the water. Oh, yeah, go and visit another and they'll sit there trading water for a second go like."
2911.52,2914.52," Huh, and then obviously."
2914.52,2926.52, I just died. I did like the way that I did like the way that I could hide in the water at one point and that the boat that was on a you know that was a guard barred who's like that was doing rounds looking for me.
2926.52,2934.52," Would shoot at me and if I went underwater, it couldn't get me. I thought that was kind of cool. Oh, but you'd still see the bullets pass. Oh, I could see the ball."
2934.52,2941.52, It's above my head and the water was kind of a need effect. And I'm not I don't think I'm really complaining about the detection.
2941.52,2943.52," I mean, I found it a little annoying, but it didn't turn up me off."
2943.52,2952.52," If someone can prove to you that it really is within range to absolutely nail that then you would they would set the standard, but no one's ever done it."
2952.52,2959.52," And it's so easy to forgive because you know this is to hey, this is what happens when you try to to reach for these stars. You're always going to put short in a few ways."
2959.52,2965.52," And I think I'm a little it's easy to hit the stretching point with that sort of AI if you're looking to break it, you'll do it every time."
2965.52,2970.52, And I think I might be a little bit unfair to it because it was such a pepiva mine and far cry.
2970.52,2976.52," Where in far cry, I do think it was a lot worse in terms of the second you would round a corner."
2976.52,2980.52, And then that would some sniper was taking you out from multiple positions.
2980.52,2992.52, So this isn't that bad. It's the same thing as you know why the rocks popping up bug me because like the closer you get to like achieving perfect realism the more obvious this even the most minor faults are.
2992.52,2994.52," Yeah, exactly."
2994.52,2998.52," Okay, so we are going to take a break."
2998.52,3001.52, And be back with.
3001.52,3003.52, Go on.
3003.52,3006.52," Three, two, one, you're the best."
3007.52,3021.52, Listen to EGM live the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly available every Monday for download at eGMlive.1up.com or podcast.1up.com or the iTunes music store.
3021.52,3026.52, We're back.
3026.52,3028.52, Ryan put the book down.
3028.52,3030.52, So story back.
3030.52,3033.52, Ryan's reading the tale of the cock.
3033.52,3036.52, What's up.
3036.52,3038.52, I can give you a tale of cock.
3038.52,3039.52, Okay.
3039.52,3042.52, I really want this on record.
3042.52,3048.52, So last week all that reminiscing about my time in second life just got me in the mood to go back.
3048.52,3050.52, So I knew this was going to happen.
3050.52,3054.52," That week, yeah, I think it was like that Friday."
3054.52,3060.52," Friday night, we're on ventrilo and like we use usual playing company heroes and at some point we said,"
3060.52,3063.52," you know what, that's all makes second life accounts."
3063.52,3065.52, Go have some fun.
3065.52,3070.52, So that we did and it was a great time.
3070.52,3072.52, It was actually a lot fun.
3072.52,3079.52, So the first thing about second life that it reminded me of and that I think everyone should try it at some point.
3079.52,3081.52, There's something just to see.
3081.52,3089.52, And suddenly you need about this game and it's that you don't get from any other game and it's because every bit of content in the world is generated by users.
3090.52,3097.52," On real estate that they pay for and it communities that just form entirely from users, you know, no NPCs or anything."
3097.52,3099.52, You are still calling this thing a game.
3099.52,3100.52, I am.
3100.52,3101.52, It's a game to me.
3101.52,3102.52, I make my own game out of it.
3102.52,3103.52, Okay.
3103.52,3104.52, And you go.
3104.52,3108.52, So the fun of it is just going on these kind of weird walkabouts.
3108.52,3110.52, Like let's just see what we can see.
3110.52,3116.52," So you start, you know, you start walking through a town and the most random things are appearing."
3116.52,3126.52, You can also search and teleport to places just based on their name and how populated it says they are and you put in search and you'll see the craziest thing is I you'll see like boocockey bliss.
3126.52,3127.52, So we're like.
3127.52,3128.52, No doubt.
3128.52,3131.52, You can actually search on that that term.
3131.52,3132.52," Oh, I just searched."
3132.52,3134.52, I just searched the adult.
3134.52,3136.52, The boocockey bliss came up.
3136.52,3139.52, So the first thing we did is.
3139.52,3140.52, It's made our work.
3140.52,3143.52, All of our characters are five of us and we remade these characters.
3143.52,3150.52, And the character manipulation system in this game is just like the best hands down nothing comes close.
3150.52,3157.52, So if you imagine the most flexible character creation thing in a wrestling game and tiger woods.
3157.52,3165.52, Whatever the case would be take that and orders of magnitude more flexible and then you have second life.
3165.52,3170.52, So I was able to take my character and the whole time you're doing this you're laughing out loud.
3170.52,3174.52," We're in tears just looking you'd sit there and be like, all right, wait turn your back to me."
3174.52,3180.52, All right turn around and then when they see what had happened to you everyone immediately is just like choking and tearing up.
3180.52,3185.52, So my character became this really like strangely her magnetic thing.
3185.52,3192.52, And I made it had just the gross size and it's just the sunken face as though like it's like mouth cancer or something.
3192.52,3196.52," And the jaw is all like, and then just giant eyelashes."
3196.52,3199.52, If it's like a big ass like.
3199.52,3208.52," Start is kind of like a grown out black mallet, but then I gave it these big, penjulous, per segging breasts like just real national geographic activities."
3208.52,3210.52, And then I.
3210.52,3216.52," I just a huge ass and super short, you know, you can manipulate the love handles."
3217.52,3224.52, And so it just took shape in front of me and a crazy ass water because like the characters like she's so like messed up.
3224.52,3229.52, Like the internal anatomy is so fucked up that it could barely barely walk.
3229.52,3232.52, So then I started you know we go to freebie island.
3232.52,3241.52, This is another must stop for all you would be second life trekkers go to freebie island and you can get yourself tons of free crap.
3241.52,3256.52, And then I got like lace panties but I also had this like limp penis with the tattoo on it.
3256.52,3262.52, But the the game would figure out to make that like kind of hang through the side of the lace panties.
3262.52,3264.52, And then I got some.
3264.52,3265.52, Some pumps.
3265.52,3270.52, Is it normally part of the character creation process that you like choose your anatomical parts?
3270.52,3272.52," Okay, that we we got later and put them on."
3272.52,3273.52, All right.
3273.52,3279.52, So we started hooking this penis considered part of your clothing like if you're walking around on a clothing area like it's okay.
3279.52,3283.52," No, you had to put it you had to put it away if you're in the right."
3283.52,3286.52, I was I didn't go to let me get there.
3286.52,3287.52, I got to tell the story in order.
3287.52,3295.52," So then we were like okay we got these messed up characters and we went right back to like Amsterdam, which is where I did this story on the prostitution."
3295.52,3302.52, It stopped those the area I was familiar with so we go there they had a new head shop in town again this is something created by a player.
3302.52,3310.52, We go in there I did a little shopping I'll be honest I didn't pay any real money I had some linden's that's the in game currency left over and they had.
3310.52,3312.52," Um, a beer hat so I got that."
3312.52,3319.52, They looked really nice on my character and it's got even the straw like the straw going into like the ice real up mouth.
3319.52,3321.52, I got a crack pipe that when I spoke it.
3321.52,3323.52, It makes my head spin.
3323.52,3325.52," Okay, exercise maneuver you know."
3325.52,3328.52, So what the crack pipe just says like automatic magic crack in it.
3328.52,3329.52," Yeah, it's a pie."
3329.52,3330.52," Yeah, it's a pie."
3330.52,3331.52, It's not a pie.
3331.52,3337.52, And then I got like a four foot bonnet with when I clicked a button like a big puff of smoke comes out of it.
3337.52,3340.52, So then decked out the character I just described to you.
3340.52,3345.52, It wearing nothing but you know the lace panties and the pipe and the beer hat.
3345.52,3352.52, We go up into we went up to where all the prostitutes were and you know where they're dancing and trying to pick up johns and I was just like.
3352.52,3355.52, You smoke I poke and then.
3355.52,3356.52, Hold on my.
3356.52,3357.52, My.
3357.52,3358.52, My.
3358.52,3361.52," Um, so we did all this and there's just a hole at this point."
3361.52,3364.52, There's five of us and it looks like you know that movie gummo.
3364.52,3369.52, It's like gummo the video game like gummo's night out and gummo's bachelor party.
3369.52,3373.52, So we're all of the steas fun despicable Rex going around.
3373.52,3375.52, And in that town.
3375.52,3377.52," Yeah, in that town."
3377.52,3381.52, The fundamental thing about this game is that for the most part everyone in their takes.
3381.52,3388.52," Seriously, they operate by their own set of values and they take it for granted that everyone's on the same page."
3388.52,3396.52, And those values are that you take care of your character that you your your avatar is is your legitimately a second life.
3396.52,3400.52, It's kind of like you know this is you role play when you play this game.
3400.52,3407.52, And so everyone has these you know gorgeous looking characters and the males are all like greed out.
3407.52,3410.52, You know like pretty boys and.
3411.52,3414.52, So they see us they don't know what to do.
3414.52,3415.52, One.
3415.52,3416.52, It's like they're really no longer.
3416.52,3419.52," Yeah, where there are no there no deformities there."
3419.52,3420.52, No.
3420.52,3422.52," You know, technically there shouldn't be any of the same."
3422.52,3424.52, You have crash the country club and they say.
3424.52,3425.52," Yeah, yeah, check."
3425.52,3429.52, So they see us and this one guy.
3429.52,3434.52, I started making fun of them because he had he had flip flops on and they had like rhinestones on them.
3434.52,3436.52, They're all like bejeweled.
3436.52,3442.52, So it's like his sister got a bit dazzling and went crazy on his wardrobe and you could tell he thought he was like totally like swissing this crap.
3442.52,3446.52, So I started ripping this guy and he's just like you guys are nerds.
3446.52,3450.52, You guys are nerds like these these sandals are worth more than everything in your entire inventory.
3450.52,3452.52, We're like.
3452.52,3453.52, Oh yeah.
3453.52,3456.52," Because again, of course, to us we're like."
3456.52,3457.52, Wow.
3457.52,3460.52, You're trying to help us fuck you up.
3460.52,3461.52, Like.
3462.52,3471.52, When then he start telling us that we look like shit and that he was going to fuck our avatars up and then again our characters we just turned him in game to look at each other.
3471.52,3476.52, And they kind of like the screwed up like shrivel up faces looking each other.
3476.52,3477.52," Oh, please do."
3477.52,3479.52, Help us out.
3479.52,3483.52, We got to think we're at the extent of how bad if you fuck our characters up.
3483.52,3485.52, So if you got some other tricks then peace.
3485.52,3486.52, Help us.
3486.52,3488.52," He just kept going and he's like, you know,"
3488.52,3490.52, then I start telling everyone at this point.
3490.52,3496.52," It's like a real, you know, an altercation was going on and so you know, we get bystanders people are walking up."
3496.52,3497.52," But what's this commotion going on, right?"
3497.52,3502.52, So then I start telling everyone that this guy beg me to suck my dick in the alley.
3502.52,3507.52, In the in exchange and he would pay me 40 lin if I let him do it.
3507.52,3512.52," So you have to imagine again, this my character has to be in your mind's eye at all times."
3512.52,3517.52," Just like for foot, her maffered eye, the grossest thing ever where he just get up."
3517.52,3520.52, And I'm telling everyone this guy owes me and I let him do it.
3520.52,3524.52," Now we will pay me and then it's just text chat, right?"
3524.52,3525.52, This is text all over.
3525.52,3526.52, So now audio.
3526.52,3527.52, Don't get to that.
3527.52,3528.52, You can now do voice chat.
3528.52,3530.52, And so that was really getting pissed off.
3530.52,3533.52, Because there's embarrassing yet approved to people that I was lying.
3533.52,3534.52, He went really good.
3534.52,3537.52, So then he started bragging about how he is a premium account holder.
3537.52,3541.52, And I guess that's where because it's the game is free for everyone else.
3541.52,3544.52, And you pay for the money that you buy stuff with.
3544.52,3547.52, But you start off here's how I had money is when you make your account.
3547.52,3553.52," I don't know if it's the same anymore, but at the time when I first made it, you get 500 free linden."
3553.52,3556.52, And that's what I've been slowly like trickling down to zero.
3556.52,3558.52, This is a bank account on.
3558.52,3559.52, The premium account.
3559.52,3562.52," I don't know what it entails, but he was saying, you know, I'm going to."
3562.52,3565.52, They always talk about the linden's because the family that started it.
3565.52,3569.52, And it's like a kind of a weird cult like a Jones town thing.
3569.52,3572.52," Because it's not like, you know, when you're playing, you're playing Quake on."
3572.52,3576.52," So when it's talking shit, you're not, well, I'm going to tell John Carmack on you."
3576.52,3579.52," You know, it's like that they're always talking about what linden's the linden."
3579.52,3581.52, I'm a premium account holder.
3581.52,3583.52, Linden's will kick your ass out of here.
3583.52,3585.52, It looks like a Scientology front.
3585.52,3586.52, It is.
3586.52,3587.52, Yeah.
3587.52,3588.52, It's kind of like that.
3588.52,3589.52, So we dealt with that guy.
3589.52,3590.52, And that was just funny.
3590.52,3592.52, And then he kept telling us about just black missed.
3592.52,3594.52, Remember that remember black missed.
3594.52,3598.52," We're just like giving us all these vague, you know, like e threats, cyber threats."
3598.52,3599.52, What does that?
3599.52,3600.52, What does that?
3600.52,3604.52," Yeah, we're supposed to, I guess we're supposed to be afraid that like we're going to get hacked or"
3604.52,3605.52, Banned or like a virus or something.
3605.52,3606.52, Yeah.
3606.52,3612.52," The usual powerless thing, you know, kids are arguing and or they are scared in their backyard and they hear noise."
3612.52,3615.52," And then you want kid tells the other kid, you got the, you got the oozy right."
3615.52,3616.52," Okay, good."
3616.52,3617.52, I'm going to load up my shotgun.
3617.52,3620.52," Like, it's that kind of, that's the internet version of kids doing that."
3620.52,3621.52, It's creepy though.
3621.52,3622.52, Black lives.
3622.52,3623.52, Yeah.
3623.52,3626.52," So that, that fool got his in up."
3627.52,3633.52, So then we kept going through different areas and the next we ended up at some kind of bar was on a spaceship.
3633.52,3636.52," And it was like, it was all pornoed out in there."
3636.52,3640.52," The walls, the usual has picture frames and they're like animated gifts."
3640.52,3643.52, Is there anything that all pornoed out in the game?
3643.52,3646.52," Like, is there, like, what's the percentage of a porno land?"
3646.52,3651.52," I think if you see like on a friend or a family members computer,"
3651.52,3655.52," you see like a second life icon in their desktop, you can assume they're in a some fucking."
3655.52,3657.52, E shit.
3657.52,3660.52, You should just assume everything.
3660.52,3664.52, It's all porno shops and like the corporate little headquarters where they have.
3664.52,3666.52, And Nike's going to have an event today.
3666.52,3669.52," All right, in between your genanigans."
3669.52,3671.52," This space bar, it started off bad."
3671.52,3676.52," Like upstairs, there's, there's like a dancing stage with a bunch of poles."
3676.52,3678.52," And it's like, it's in a hot tub."
3678.52,3679.52, This would be a pretty good strip club.
3679.52,3680.52," I'm saying if it was real, right?"
3680.52,3682.52, Because it's like a hot tub all around the space.
3682.52,3685.52," And you can just sit in there and kind of like, wake if you want."
3685.52,3687.52, Want to be like dancing.
3687.52,3690.52," So instead of doing that, we rolled in and forced."
3690.52,3693.52," And I'm like, all right, everyone, get on those fucking poles."
3693.52,3697.52," So the poles have the animation and they make, they'll, they'll make you dance."
3697.52,3698.52, And very elaborate.
3698.52,3700.52," Like we're talking, you know, prints of purgit type shit."
3700.52,3703.52, We're someone like really sweated like the details.
3703.52,3706.52," I mean, they were like using like mocap reference and everything."
3706.52,3708.52," So these, these user made animation."
3708.52,3711.52, I've seen like a real stripper named like Venus do the exact same day.
3711.52,3714.52," I just like, but these must be, yeah, the user, right?"
3714.52,3717.52," Because their user made, of course, everything is user made."
3717.52,3718.52, Right.
3718.52,3721.52," Yeah, it's like the linens didn't say we need to give a good pole."
3721.52,3723.52, For this club.
3723.52,3726.52, So the people made it and you go up there and it's rad when you see that character I got.
3726.52,3729.52, And it's doing like a woman's dance.
3729.52,3732.52, But then there's like this like package in there.
3732.52,3734.52, It's just like kind of crazy.
3734.52,3737.52, So all the people we're all doing that all these poles.
3737.52,3740.52, And people start clearing out like they don't want any of this because there's tip
3740.52,3743.52, jars and stuff and that's another way people make money.
3743.52,3748.52, They'll just leave their avatar dancing and they'll talk to you and people will actually pay the money.
3748.52,3749.52, Like that was a good dance.
3749.52,3753.52, And then people start all jumping out of the hot tub like someone like farted in or something.
3753.52,3756.52, And then the security will kick us out.
3756.52,3758.52, I need to shower after this podcast.
3758.52,3759.52," Dude, I haven't even gotten there."
3759.52,3762.52," So we're like, okay, we could deal with this in that same place."
3762.52,3766.52, So we started exploring after we got kicked out of that club in the same area.
3766.52,3769.52, Somehow we found the subterranean cavern and it's more kinky shit there.
3769.52,3775.52, Like there's just these in the game there's these balls and like you go up to him and they're like interact nodes.
3775.52,3780.52," And you'll look at it and it'll be like, get eaten out and the other one will be like, do the eat now."
3780.52,3784.52," And so you click, this is so this is second life man."
3784.52,3785.52, You guys are looking at me.
3785.52,3787.52, We're going to have to censor this.
3787.52,3790.52," Okay, because it gets this is the game."
3790.52,3793.52," Okay, so parents if we haven't turned this off yet,"
3793.52,3795.52, which you should have about 20 minutes ago.
3795.52,3796.52, You see all this.
3796.52,3798.52, Stop complaining about mass effects.
3798.52,3801.52," Yeah, exactly."
3801.52,3804.52, Like people are making up this crap in mass effect.
3804.52,3809.52," When with this game, I haven't even gotten like this is the soft core stuff."
3809.52,3811.52, And then down there it's starting to get in a little creepier.
3811.52,3813.52, There's like these all these vines on the ground.
3813.52,3816.52," And then someone's like, I think Anthony is going up to it."
3816.52,3818.52," And we're like, dude, don't go over there man."
3818.52,3819.52, That does not look good.
3819.52,3822.52," And sure enough, he interacts with it."
3822.52,3824.52," And then the vines just poof, they're like, strap him down."
3824.52,3826.52, And it's like 10 o'clock coming up.
3826.52,3828.52," And they started with you, imagine."
3828.52,3829.52, Okay.
3829.52,3830.52, That's in the same area.
3830.52,3835.52," So then, okay, there's some other really good things about this trip."
3835.52,3837.52," I got to say, we went to the Bukaki Club,"
3837.52,3839.52, who walked in and was called again.
3839.52,3841.52, The Bukaki Club.
3841.52,3843.52," And it's like, the first thing we get in there,"
3843.52,3845.52," James is like, dude, it's raining."
3845.52,3847.52, It's a little bit of a game.
3847.52,3848.52, James milky.
3848.52,3849.52," No, James."
3849.52,3850.52, Someone in our group.
3850.52,3852.52," And then we were like,"
3853.52,3855.52, You're right.
3855.52,3857.52, You're going to further.
3857.52,3860.52," In this club, it's the usual."
3860.52,3862.52," Everyone is like, supposed to be super sexy looking."
3862.52,3863.52, And we come in there.
3863.52,3865.52, And some of them will laugh.
3865.52,3866.52, And a lot of them will just get angry.
3866.52,3868.52," So the point where most worlds we go in,"
3868.52,3870.52, we'll get kicked a second we appear.
3870.52,3871.52, People see us.
3871.52,3875.52," And it's like, dude, no, we reserved the right to review service to anyone."
3875.52,3877.52," And like, all we need is a glimpse of your ad."
3877.52,3879.52, We don't want you in here.
3879.52,3881.52, So it's that it's just to interrupt for one second.
3881.52,3882.52, That's how it works.
3882.52,3884.52, That these places are like user owned.
3884.52,3885.52, Yeah.
3885.52,3886.52, So they can just say it.
3886.52,3887.52, You're out.
3887.52,3888.52, It's like a server.
3888.52,3889.52, Yeah.
3889.52,3890.52, And if they have those people in there.
3890.52,3891.52," If they have, you know,"
3891.52,3894.52," Oh, I'm some kind of mock riders."
3894.52,3895.52, Yeah.
3895.52,3896.52, They're in there that kick you.
3896.52,3899.52, And it was just our luck to arrive in the Bukaki club when there was no one there.
3899.52,3902.52, And everyone was lucky to get out.
3902.52,3904.52," And so as we explore in there, I mean, it's so messed up."
3904.52,3906.52," There'll be like, there's a unicorn in there."
3906.52,3908.52," And you go up to it and interact and it's like,"
3908.52,3911.52, you lay down spread eagle in the unicorn uses its horn.
3911.52,3914.52," And I mean, then there's like this submission swing."
3914.52,3916.52," And then, okay, calling."
3916.52,3919.52," The details are gross, but they're going somewhere good."
3919.52,3920.52, Yeah.
3920.52,3921.52, Because so Roy got his character.
3921.52,3923.52, And it's just the most disgusting looking thing ever.
3923.52,3925.52," It looks like some kind of crazy, hard looking baby."
3925.52,3930.52, And he got it stuck in this submissive animation from a sex swing.
3930.52,3934.52, So that means when he got off that he was on his back on the ground.
3934.52,3937.52, But he could still move around in that position.
3937.52,3939.52," And then in this game, there's physics."
3939.52,3941.52," So when you bump into someone, it hits him."
3941.52,3944.52, So we started doing like Bozo bowling with him.
3944.52,3948.52," Or like he throw him in this position with the big, you know,"
3948.52,3949.52, he's got an erection.
3949.52,3951.52," Of course, he's in his position."
3951.52,3953.52, Or throw him through the crowd.
3953.52,3955.52, He's the instant around.
3955.52,3957.52, Not get everyone over.
3957.52,3959.52, I wish somebody had a photograph of this scene right here.
3959.52,3960.52, I have.
3960.52,3961.52, John is gleefully.
3961.52,3962.52," No, I mean, the pissing."
3962.52,3964.52, John is gleefully going on about this.
3964.52,3968.52," And Ryan, John and me are all have our head in our hands."
3968.52,3970.52, You guys are closing our eyes.
3970.52,3971.52, It's you never told.
3971.52,3975.52, It's just a game that's largely submissive.
3975.52,3978.52," And knocked the dudes over because there's like,"
3978.52,3981.52, there's like a big like a minitar naked in there.
3981.52,3983.52," And we already fight with him because he was like,"
3983.52,3988.52, tell us we're ugly and I told him that I would serve his unit on fear factor if he didn't shut up.
3988.52,3990.52, So then I.
3990.52,3991.52," So then we're like,"
3991.52,3993.52," all right, then you want to learn how we bowl."
3993.52,3996.52, Just bowl in his ass over.
3996.52,4000.52, We're all trying to.
4000.52,4005.52, And then later we found out that you can get sound files in the same way that you can get.
4005.52,4008.52, That you can add all these parts to your body.
4008.52,4009.52, You can get these sounds.
4009.52,4013.52, And we heard this because someone was like farting and queefing in a area.
4013.52,4016.52, But it was like supposed to be where it rotting though.
4016.52,4017.52," They were like, you could see them talk."
4017.52,4018.52, Of course it was.
4018.52,4019.52, And we found out it.
4020.52,4022.52, And we couldn't get him to give us those files.
4022.52,4023.52, We really needed them.
4023.52,4025.52, But we got air eight sirens.
4025.52,4031.52, And we replicated that to everyone in our group so that we could get like the fucking air eight sirens going.
4031.52,4032.52, And then loop them.
4032.52,4035.52," So like we all take turns like, okay, you, okay, now you, now you and a bit like,"
4035.52,4036.52," right, right, right, right,"
4036.52,4038.52, super loud throughout the whole.
4038.52,4044.52, The whole world and people are like saying that it was a salt and we were assaulting them with it.
4044.52,4046.52, And yeah.
4047.52,4049.52," I'm just saying, I think everyone should go in."
4049.52,4051.52, Not to that.
4051.52,4053.52," You can like, you can like, you can like, you don't want to."
4053.52,4059.52," Like we go to the beach and there's like, because if there's say an animation to lay down on a beach blanket,"
4059.52,4062.52, there's always one for like another person to join them.
4062.52,4066.52, It's like a male position or a female position or just two mutual colors or whatever.
4066.52,4068.52, So you go up to like some bohunk looking dude.
4068.52,4072.52, You take like your nasty ass character and you like throw down and it's lap.
4072.52,4074.52," And it for like, you mean it's all animated."
4074.52,4077.52," So like it's a tender embrace, you know, it looks like a honey moon scene."
4077.52,4079.52, And then they seen as they see it.
4079.52,4080.52, They jump up immediately.
4080.52,4082.52, It's like the rat is steak.
4082.52,4083.52, They start yelling at you.
4083.52,4085.52, What the hell are you supposed to be get out of here?
4085.52,4089.52, But I think they also like laying on a lounge chair in.
4089.52,4091.52, That's the thing.
4091.52,4092.52, Right.
4092.52,4094.52," You know, it is at a computer."
4094.52,4095.52, So you can respond to your lesson.
4095.52,4096.52," Yeah, what the hell."
4096.52,4101.52, And they know too that the whole conspicuous consumption theme in the game.
4102.52,4107.52, So when green that they could tell our shit was free because Anthony got all this bling for his character.
4107.52,4110.52," Which looks like, you know, cathulu is all tentacles."
4110.52,4114.52, Hes is like a cathulu of like fowluses because he just stuck so many on his face.
4114.52,4116.52, And it's wearing gold.
4116.52,4117.52, It's like wearing bling.
4117.52,4122.52," So if you imagine the cathulu of the dog with like a giant money sign and like 14 parrot gold,"
4122.52,4125.52," it all stout, you know, and a mustache."
4125.52,4128.52," Wait, why does that bring him up?"
4128.52,4131.52," Yeah, they're telling like nice free free gold."
4131.52,4137.52, I guess what they noticed.
4137.52,4139.52," Yeah, that was the price free gold."
4139.52,4141.52, They totally recognize like just like that.
4141.52,4144.52," He recognized it a bunch of free be island, you know."
4144.52,4147.52, So it's all just it's a class war inside.
4147.52,4148.52, It is.
4148.52,4149.52, It is.
4149.52,4151.52, This other game.
4151.52,4152.52, It was kind of a crazy.
4152.52,4156.52," On some level, I don't want to compare battlefield of heroes to second life."
4156.52,4157.52, But that's the principle though.
4157.52,4160.52," I want to where you just, you know, you're hanging with people and you're like,"
4160.52,4163.52, let's just do this and you go and have a great time with whatever.
4163.52,4169.52, We also got into this game that just a YouTube video has been going around for it.
4169.52,4172.52," It's called Noah's Adventure 2, Zero Race."
4172.52,4174.52," And this one is, um,"
4174.52,4177.52," God, I'm trying to find everyone in this."
4177.52,4179.52," No, no, no, no, no, no."
4179.52,4181.52, No one is unscathed.
4181.52,4183.52, So the zero race game.
4184.52,4190.52," It's like a, it's supposed to be a Christian game and it's about like after after Noah's"
4190.52,4194.52," arc, you know, in the 40 day, the flood that lasted 40 days and 40 nights and after it"
4194.52,4198.52, sets down on Mount Ayrrat and the animals get out and they need to exercise.
4198.52,4203.52," Well, there's like races between the animals like speed, foot races, you know."
4203.52,4205.52, So you can go to fastest and this is the point of this game.
4205.52,4209.52, And you're one of the animals and it's got a cast of including hand of the horse and
4210.52,4215.52, the king of the cougar and Priscilla the pig and so on and so forth.
4215.52,4217.52," And, but it's some crazy issue."
4217.52,4219.52, Where did you get win this game?
4219.52,4220.52, What was it from YouTube?
4220.52,4221.52, That's right.
4221.52,4222.52, That promotional.
4222.52,4223.52, Okay.
4223.52,4227.52, They put it the co-generactive makers of the game put the YouTube video up to promote it.
4227.52,4231.52," And it kind of got became a meme of its own and I feel bad for him because you know,"
4231.52,4233.52, vicious people are on YouTube commentary.
4233.52,4235.52, So they started ripping on him.
4236.52,4242.52, So I downloaded the demo of this game and that's at zooraise.com.
4242.52,4244.52," Jeff, you're looking at me like why you need to."
4244.52,4248.52," You're like, you're saying that you feel bad for them getting ripped on and you're about to,"
4248.52,4251.52, I know you're about to rip on and you're some more.
4251.52,4252.52, I might.
4252.52,4257.52, But the game is weird though because it you play it.
4257.52,4262.52," There's, there's, it's wildly anacronistic in that you're,"
4262.52,4266.52," I think what's the opposite word for when something you know anacronism is,"
4266.52,4268.52, when you when you play it the other direction.
4268.52,4272.52," So that in in this timeframe, within this post,"
4272.52,4277.52," this anti-deluvian period, you have all this like Christian themes and scripture."
4277.52,4283.52, You'll have you know stained glass windows from cathedrals that are appearing in Noah's time.
4283.52,4284.52, Was it that right?
4284.52,4285.52, Anacronistic.
4285.52,4287.52, There's actually another term for.
4287.52,4289.52," Well, don't, don't people."
4289.52,4290.52, Don't people.
4290.52,4293.52, They're hanging out in the library like in modern times get turned into the animals and
4293.52,4295.52, transport into the passes and that's the setup.
4295.52,4296.52," Yeah, I thought that was the back door."
4296.52,4299.52," That's part of the story, but I don't, I can't even understand."
4299.52,4305.52," I mean, I have some benefits from that story to show you and their weird."
4305.52,4307.52," But so the whole time you're playing like there'll be fools,"
4307.52,4311.52, it throwing explosive barrels at you and you ride on a rocket.
4311.52,4315.52, There's like a world where two vintage core sauer flies down and tries to bomb you
4315.52,4316.52, when you're racing.
4317.52,4320.52," Well, Noah is reading as you're as you're racing."
4320.52,4323.52, Noah's reading scripture to you from the New Testament.
4323.52,4327.52," So, and Noah sounds like a really weird as dude because he sounds,"
4327.52,4329.52," well, he does the announcing for the race too."
4329.52,4335.52," So he'll, he'll want you to, he'll want to let you know who's winning his losing"
4335.52,4338.52, so it'll be like in the lead.
4339.52,4352.52," And then he'll, then all of a sudden you're here."
4352.52,4356.52, You will be thrown into the lake of fire.
4356.52,4359.52," And as you're racing, all of a sudden there's like guys who's a flame,"
4359.52,4361.52, shooting up and stuff.
4361.52,4365.52, And that of course is a quote from the New Testament and same thing.
4366.52,4369.52, That sounds like a South Park episode.
4369.52,4370.52, It does.
4370.52,4371.52, More than a game.
4371.52,4374.52," The craziest thing about it, the game is hilarious."
4374.52,4377.52," Now, the point of the game, right, this game, you laugh."
4377.52,4380.52," You can, you hit spacebar to make animal sounds when you race."
4380.52,4383.52," But all this in economics, except if you're talking about it, the shooting barrels."
4383.52,4388.52," I mean, this is just to give, I assume, it correct me if I'm wrong."
4388.52,4394.52," This is to, to give families who would be predisposed to not like video games or"
4394.52,4399.52," just trust video games to be able to say, I'm going to let my kid play games,"
4399.52,4402.52, but I'm going to this Christian friendly side.
4402.52,4407.52," Yeah, I can get a game that will not offend my sensibilities, right?"
4407.52,4413.52, Right. And so this is just incorporating basic whatever racing platformy game play
4413.52,4416.52, into something that's got a Bible theme.
4416.52,4417.52, Right.
4417.52,4418.52, The most reasonable theme.
4418.52,4422.52, But the problem of course is that it's not teaching you anything about the Bible
4422.52,4425.52, because this stuff has nothing to do with the Bible.
4425.52,4427.52, It's getting it all out.
4427.52,4432.52," I mean, maybe sometimes the lines that you hear might come from a King James translation"
4432.52,4437.52," of the Bible, but everything is in this weird jumble and out of context."
4437.52,4441.52," And again, the story, the interesting thing is, of course, the story of Noah is about"
4441.52,4446.52," every animal on the planet being destroyed, saved for two of each kind."
4446.52,4451.52," And it's supposed to be this game about man and God's love for animals, you know?"
4451.52,4454.52," It's like these are fun animals. They like to jump,"
4454.52,4457.52, to put these burrows and run through legs of fire.
4457.52,4461.52," It's kind of weird to me that the whole story of Noah is such a,"
4461.52,4464.52," like absolutely, you know, misantropic."
4464.52,4467.52, I want to know I know was reading from the New Testament.
4467.52,4468.52, I don't know how that happens.
4468.52,4470.52, One of the issues here.
4470.52,4472.52, The other key features that there's these songs playing.
4472.52,4477.52," We got a sample of one, and we'll play it right about now."
4477.52,4482.52, I've never lived my life just don't let go of you.
4482.52,4496.52," Let me, let's me, let's me, let me live my life."
4496.52,4498.52, And you heard that right.
4498.52,4500.52," It's, hopefully, we played, we put it in there."
4500.52,4502.52," As you're playing, the guys talking about, you know,"
4502.52,4507.52," use me, fill me in all these other, like awkward, you know, awkward,"
4507.52,4509.52, going back to the second life story now.
4509.52,4511.52," But the thing that's interesting for this game for me,"
4511.52,4516.52," it's always fascinating to see these kind of works where you imagine,"
4516.52,4519.52," if you're, if you're Christian and you're living your life according to"
4519.52,4524.52," scripture, there's not much room for a lot of the things that people do"
4524.52,4527.52," in their lives normally, for the secular things they do,"
4527.52,4531.52," but they know they like them, and they don't want to get rid of"
4531.52,4532.52, them understandably so.
4532.52,4535.52, So they try to find a way to justify it.
4535.52,4538.52," So in this case, it's like, like, making video games."
4538.52,4539.52, I like video games.
4539.52,4540.52, But how do I get it?
4540.52,4543.52, How do I do a video game that sits right with my faith?
4543.52,4545.52," And that sits right with my God, you know?"
4545.52,4549.52, And then you end up with these really weird awkward things like this.
4549.52,4553.52," Where you're like, you, you, you've made this weird game,"
4553.52,4556.52, and now you're trying to say that it's like glorifying God.
4556.52,4557.52, Right.
4557.52,4560.52," I mean, to be fair, there's probably games that do this across"
4560.52,4566.52," the spectrum of any, you know, any interest group that has any particular"
4566.52,4570.52," agenda to push, right, or or belief systems say."
4570.52,4574.52, If I could probably find some green friendly games on the way.
4574.52,4575.52," Oh, yeah, that's all that stuff, you know?"
4575.52,4579.52," In educational, and skip the hamster, save the environment."
4579.52,4580.52," Right, exactly."
4580.52,4581.52," So yeah, that's there."
4581.52,4584.52," My experience because you know, I mad grew up going going to, you know,"
4584.52,4587.52," Christian churches, and so it's like, I know firsthand."
4587.52,4592.52, I've seen Christian comic books and music and all these things where it's just the
4592.52,4596.52," most awkward fit where you're like, really, if you're going to live according to the way"
4596.52,4600.52," you're supposed to be according to faith, you probably shouldn't be doing this at all."
4600.52,4604.52, And it just kind of wascha when you go that far to justify it.
4604.52,4605.52, I don't know.
4605.52,4606.52," I mean, I'm not going to cast stones on it."
4606.52,4609.52," I'm speaking on behalf of our magazine or anything, but just my own experience"
4609.52,4611.52, when you get certainly adult.
4611.52,4612.52, This is a weird game.
4612.52,4617.52," I don't see it being a useful instructional tool for a person of,"
4617.52,4622.52," well, the things that struck me the most, I've all of this was I went to the MySpace"
4622.52,4625.52, page because you linked to it to me Sean before the podcast.
4625.52,4629.52," And that music that hopefully played earlier, what disturbed me the most is it's"
4629.52,4631.52, described on that MySpace page.
4631.52,4633.52, It's classic hard rock.
4633.52,4640.52," Yeah, inspired by Elvis Costello and let's up on the other interesting thing about"
4640.52,4642.52, that to come out is that there's a review.
4642.52,4647.52, Here's a review of a game and I want to read it a few lines.
4647.52,4652.52, And this was linked on the media page on the website for the game as Zura's hits a
4652.52,4653.52, home run.
4653.52,4656.52," So there of you says, y'all know me."
4656.52,4660.52, I do not go along with the rest of the lemmings following the logic to the world.
4660.52,4664.52," Instead, I go to God and listen to what he has to say about video games."
4664.52,4668.52," Finding games like Zura's on the personal computer is something I love to do,"
4668.52,4674.52," but God gets the glory because finding out about this game was his handy work, not mine."
4674.52,4676.52, So that was really weird to me.
4676.52,4679.52, I thought it to PR on this game.
4679.52,4680.52," Yeah, the guy to the point."
4680.52,4683.52," Yeah, and showed him, he's like, check this out man."
4683.52,4688.52," And like the fact that God has anything to say about video games in the first place,"
4688.52,4691.52, this kind of goes back to my thing.
4691.52,4692.52," Like really like, hey, no offense."
4692.52,4695.52, Like do if you want to do something to to
4696.52,4700.52," to glorify God, I don't know if his erase is exactly the best way to do."
4700.52,4704.52," On the other hand, if God did do PR on this game, we probably want to give it a good review."
4704.52,4706.52, I'm thinking that's true.
4706.52,4708.52," I don't want to, there might be some retaliation."
4708.52,4713.52, There's some intellectual acrobatics that you can form though when you're that persuasion.
4713.52,4719.52," You could say that we're allowed to, that Satan is using us to"
4719.52,4726.52, start the message and confuse people to sway them from from getting the good stuff that is erase.
4726.52,4729.52," Also, I just succeeded on that headline."
4729.52,4731.52, Zurez hits a home run.
4731.52,4732.52," Hi, duh."
4732.52,4734.52, You make the racing metaphor.
4734.52,4736.52, Zurez hits a home run.
4736.52,4738.52, Zurez comes in first or something.
4738.52,4742.52," Yeah, you know, you don't put the baseball metaphor in the racing game thing."
4742.52,4743.52, That's the basic.
4743.52,4748.52," So if you are interested, the soundtrack is available at cougarinteractive.com"
4748.52,4751.52, for the very biblical price of $7.77.
4751.52,4752.52, Right.
4752.52,4759.52," And the game, the full version of the game, the demos free, the full version of the game is 1777."
4759.52,4765.52, The other thing about it that's fun to do that was entertaining is that you can do a dance party.
4765.52,4769.52," And that's basically you go in the art with Noah and he's got this alter,"
4769.52,4775.52, who's a sacrificial alter where the animals are normally burned and sacrificed.
4775.52,4779.52," But this one, there's like technical light and smoke coming out of it."
4779.52,4783.52, The animals are chilling because they're not going to get sacrificed on it.
4783.52,4785.52, So they're all spinning around in the room.
4785.52,4787.52," And if you click them, they'll spin out more and make sound."
4787.52,4789.52," And Noah, you can get him doing 360s too."
4789.52,4793.52," But as he's doing it, in the songs are playing, you get to choose which song and the soundtrack"
4793.52,4795.52, that plays in this party.
4795.52,4796.52, It still still saves the same lines.
4796.52,4799.52, He's talking about like the going to the lake of fire and stuff.
4799.52,4802.52, As he's like having a hold down with his animals.
4802.52,4804.52," Like doing, you can't get the Brittany."
4804.52,4806.52, That's why this whole time it got awkward.
4806.52,4809.52," You guys are looking at me like dude, we're going to get so much trouble for this."
4809.52,4815.52," But I'm telling you, no, like if everyone is like a devout Christian and I have to apologize for the second life thing,"
4815.52,4820.52," but who's listening, we'll be like, yeah, dude Noah and the dance party, not much."
4820.52,4821.52, Right.
4821.52,4822.52, That's not a dance party.
4822.52,4825.52, I don't have a swimming who else we could offend on this podcast.
4825.52,4828.52, Because we've hit the sex with the cocky games.
4828.52,4831.52," The sex is, that was what I was on that."
4831.52,4833.52, That was a report.
4833.52,4834.52, That was a report.
4834.52,4837.52, All the people that are freaking out about sex and games.
4837.52,4841.52," Second life man, there's, there's foul or stuff in that."
4841.52,4844.52," I didn't even, I got, I saved you guys."
4844.52,4847.52, Do that on your after hours podcast.
4847.52,4853.52," Well, I did put up some pics on my, I, I linked to a month, a couple threads on my put file folder."
4853.52,4857.52," Some of a photo album from our, a travel log, if you will."
4857.52,4859.52, You can see those characters I talked about.
4859.52,4861.52, There were a sluckin' at.
4861.52,4864.52," I have to say, there are a bit hard to unsee."
4864.52,4865.52, You have seen them.
4865.52,4867.52, I saw his character.
4867.52,4868.52, Did you have a scene of him?
4868.52,4869.52, I haven't seen it.
4869.52,4870.52, I saw him look at her.
4870.52,4871.52, Laying in that guy's arms in the beach.
4871.52,4874.52," Yeah, I saw that photo."
4874.52,4876.52," You saw me with the, with the bang in the beard head."
4876.52,4877.52, All right.
4877.52,4879.52," I saw you in the head shop, right."
4879.52,4881.52, Out in the street.
4881.52,4886.52, It's Roy's character when he figured out how to like make his palace like five feet long.
4886.52,4891.52, This is the piphany in the moment.
4891.52,4892.52, This is your job.
4892.52,4894.52," What a, what a pretty great job to have."
4894.52,4895.52, Talk about that.
4895.52,4896.52," Well, I did that on my free time."
4896.52,4897.52, I was extracurricular.
4897.52,4900.52, That's what was bonus bonus material.
4900.52,4901.52," Oh, uh, okay."
4901.52,4902.52, Can't play it.
4902.52,4904.52, It work.
4904.52,4906.52," Oh, there, there is this to be fair though."
4906.52,4908.52, All of second life isn't that way.
4908.52,4911.52, I do suspect that everyone in there is a freak of some sort.
4911.52,4914.52, But like NPR has like many spaces in there.
4914.52,4919.52, I actually did go to the NPR science Friday auditorium.
4919.52,4923.52," And I just put on, I just tucked my unit away and put on my panties and."
4923.52,4925.52, I went into our special party and figure out.
4925.52,4928.52, So you went into the NPR science Friday auditorium.
4928.52,4929.52, Yeah.
4929.52,4930.52, And that there was recording going on.
4930.52,4932.52, So there were more and very many people.
4932.52,4934.52, But I just was a general was like science.
4934.52,4935.52," Well, it's a normally on it."
4935.52,4937.52, When they do the science Friday show.
4937.52,4938.52, Yeah.
4938.52,4939.52, There'll be people sitting in there.
4939.52,4941.52, And they'll still stream it live in there.
4941.52,4944.52, There's a lot of stuff like that where people will have.
4944.52,4946.52, There'll be like a street musician.
4946.52,4949.52, And you could buy is her album right there.
4949.52,4952.52, And you could play it like they'll be playing it in the world.
4952.52,4954.52," You know, you could shut it off if you don't want to hear it."
4954.52,4955.52, But they'll be playing it.
4955.52,4957.52, So there's a lot of stuff like that.
4957.52,4958.52, Then another thing I feel bad.
4958.52,4961.52, I went into like some like women's only thing.
4961.52,4963.52," And I turned out I think it was like,"
4963.52,4968.52," um, it was all like you kind of like hipster lesbian characters in there."
4968.52,4970.52, And they were like having some serious talk.
4970.52,4973.52, And then I just went up and got crawled in underlaps.
4973.52,4975.52, And it was like supposed to be women only in there.
4975.52,4977.52, But I still had my unit on.
4977.52,4979.52," And I was like, it's post up."
4979.52,4980.52, Let me chill.
4980.52,4985.52, And did they like you?
4985.52,4987.52," They were like, okay, what's that?"
4987.52,4989.52," They were like, okay, Nicole with that."
4989.52,4993.52, They kicked me actually after I didn't quite fit the.
4993.52,4995.52, I didn't quite fit the vibe.
4995.52,4997.52," Well, that's a surprise."
4997.52,5000.52," But if you wanted around long enough,"
5000.52,5004.52, we'd find most of Moses's dance club from zoo race in there too.
5004.52,5007.52, There's a really nice star worth theme stuff.
5007.52,5008.52, They even doesn't other place.
5008.52,5009.52, I got kicked out every place.
5009.52,5011.52, They have star worth theme and they have battles.
5011.52,5013.52," Because you can have guns, but there are places you go."
5013.52,5015.52," And they've like, you got to take your weapons off."
5015.52,5018.52, And it's like this most isolated type theme thing.
5018.52,5020.52, And they have the Millennium Balkans out there.
5020.52,5022.52, But there's these benches in the Cantina.
5022.52,5025.52, And they pay you like three linden for every 10 minutes.
5025.52,5027.52, You sit there.
5027.52,5031.52," And the reason they do this again, it's like, this is the fun of this whole game."
5031.52,5036.52, The things that people come up with that basically parallel to real world.
5036.52,5041.52," And that's if you run this, if you have this property and you're selling things in it,"
5041.52,5043.52," and you know, business is going on in entertainment."
5043.52,5046.52, All of these are in scarequos.
5046.52,5052.52, You attract more in the same way that people naturally people complain about lines.
5052.52,5054.52," But if you form a line, they'll join in."
5054.52,5055.52, You ever do this?
5055.52,5057.52, Just go stand in front of a awesome way with three good.
5057.52,5058.52, Sure.
5058.52,5060.52," Next thing you know, there are like 10 people behind you."
5060.52,5064.52, So they want you to just make it look like the world is active and popular.
5064.52,5065.52, I sit on the bench.
5065.52,5066.52, They want you to let me do that.
5066.52,5069.52, I sat on that bench trying to make some free money to go buy some more crack pipes.
5069.52,5071.52," And they were like, the kick minus out."
5071.52,5072.52, Yeah.
5072.52,5074.52," Well, you're probably not attracting more customers."
5074.52,5075.52, Looking that way.
5075.52,5076.52, I'm sure it can you.
5076.52,5077.52, Yeah.
5077.52,5078.52," But yeah, they have transformers."
5078.52,5080.52, They have every kind of theme you can imagine.
5080.52,5084.52, You can you can get parts and become a transformer if you want.
5084.52,5087.52," And see, suddenly Ryan's looking up."
5087.52,5089.52," Hey, Ryan's all bow. You can."
5089.52,5090.52, I can be bumblebee.
5090.52,5091.52, Yeah.
5091.52,5092.52, Cool.
5092.52,5096.52," With my character driving in the front seat, man."
5096.52,5098.52, All right.
5098.52,5103.52, A second life has gotten more airtime on this podcast than I am.
5103.52,5104.52, I think you should try it.
5104.52,5105.52, It's one of those.
5105.52,5107.52, You don't want to do it alone.
5107.52,5109.52, You'll feel like really awkward and embarrassed if you do it alone.
5109.52,5111.52," It's kind of like when you're, you know,"
5111.52,5114.52," strength and numbers and you know, when you're like 18,"
5114.52,5117.52," you go into like the porno shot, you want to go with your friends."
5117.52,5119.52, You all just be like laughing at stuff.
5119.52,5120.52," You want to be like the one dude in there alone,"
5120.52,5122.52, going to the counter with like a stack of 20.
5122.52,5123.52, Right.
5123.52,5124.52, Real video.
5124.52,5125.52, It's not so funny when you're.
5125.52,5126.52, Yeah.
5126.52,5127.52, As I've read.
5127.52,5128.52, Okay.
5128.52,5131.52," So, but let me ask you if if you if I download second life,"
5131.52,5132.52, or if one does.
5132.52,5135.52, And and I'm not predisposed.
5135.52,5137.52, You want to go to the Bukaki club.
5137.52,5141.52, Like what what's this like that I make my my person.
5141.52,5146.52, I go into the world like what's the default like regular stuff you're going to see?
5146.52,5148.52," Because that's like hidden away in the back alleys, right?"
5148.52,5151.52," I mean, no, you can go to regular like."
5151.52,5153.52," I mean, you can go to non adult, you know,"
5153.52,5156.52," all ages areas and you could buy, you know,"
5156.52,5158.52, but bikes and motorcycles.
5158.52,5159.52, Like I got a bicycle.
5159.52,5160.52, I would you want to do that though.
5160.52,5162.52, With like a pinwheel that I could do jumps on.
5162.52,5164.52, That's another thing you could fly in this game.
5164.52,5165.52, Everyone can automatically fly.
5165.52,5168.52, So then you fly up above like a big crowd of people really.
5168.52,5170.52, And then you you turn off flights.
5170.52,5172.52, So you can do that in a while.
5172.52,5173.52, So you can do it right away in this.
5173.52,5175.52, You don't need a legendary amount.
5175.52,5176.52, And I could fly on my bike.
5176.52,5178.52, The bike is got a pinwheel and a banana seed.
5178.52,5180.52, But then I'll go up and you fly above a big crowd.
5180.52,5183.52, And then you turn off flight and you do a face plant like.
5183.52,5185.52, Like buck ass naked like right in the middle of all these people.
5185.52,5189.52, Also just like splat can you die like some dirty darkosh.
5189.52,5190.52, Yeah.
5190.52,5191.52, Look at you like.
5191.52,5192.52, Whoa dude.
5193.52,5194.52, Still one.
5194.52,5195.52, There's not death or anything right.
5195.52,5199.52, You know there's pe- I've seen I don't know if it's kind of weird role play thing.
5199.52,5201.52, I've seen in like a back alley.
5201.52,5204.52, There's some area where like you can play a murder victim or something.
5204.52,5205.52, God.
5205.52,5207.52, And they're laying there like knife in them.
5207.52,5208.52, That's I mean I'm not even there.
5208.52,5211.52, There's full on we saw full on torture dungeons and stuff.
5211.52,5214.52, Like seriously repugnant stuff.
5214.52,5215.52, That I'm not.
5215.52,5220.52, It's nasty as it is like if you think of the dirty thing on the internet you ever accidentally saw.
5221.52,5222.52, That's the search and for anything.
5222.52,5225.52, Basically on Google and you forgot to have safe search on.
5225.52,5228.52, There's a matter of what's put in any word you want.
5228.52,5229.52, Someone who's into that.
5229.52,5230.52, Huh.
5230.52,5232.52, They got it on their belt now.
5232.52,5233.52, I think I have to.
5233.52,5234.52, Are you gonna down outside my life now?
5234.52,5235.52, I think I have to.
5235.52,5236.52, Funny.
5236.52,5238.52, It's fun as fun as I think I'm going to go on alone.
5238.52,5239.52, Ryan.
5239.52,5240.52, Go ahead.
5240.52,5241.52, We'll see.
5241.52,5243.52, It's like a dare.
5243.52,5245.52, Are you gonna take a drink?
5245.52,5246.52, I'm not a few.
5246.52,5247.52, I will.
5247.52,5248.52, I'll do it.
5249.52,5251.52, I've done worse than all this in real life.
5251.52,5252.52, So.
5252.52,5253.52, I don't know.
5253.52,5256.52, And you'll feel right at home in there.
5256.52,5257.52, Yeah.
5257.52,5260.52, Just make sure to stop by Tom go by the head shop and answer.
5260.52,5263.52, And tell him I did I've recommended to be a head.
5263.52,5264.52, What's your carry?
5264.52,5265.52, Free your meals.
5265.52,5266.52, I'll get my minutes.
5266.52,5268.52," Actually, she should be careful about it."
5268.52,5270.52, Just send people to start auto ban in me.
5270.52,5271.52, I don't want to go.
5271.52,5272.52, I don't want to go.
5272.52,5273.52, I don't want to get worse.
5273.52,5274.52, Like just.
5274.52,5276.52, You're coming before I even get there.
5276.52,5278.52, I find out that I'm not allowed in.
5278.52,5279.52, Yeah.
5279.52,5282.52," Sometimes though when they immediately kick you from an area,"
5282.52,5283.52," because there's like sectors,"
5283.52,5285.52, maybe it's just from a specific property.
5285.52,5287.52, And you're still allowed in the area.
5287.52,5289.52," And we found ways to kind of like get back in,"
5289.52,5291.52, like some kind of hole in the building or something to come back in.
5291.52,5294.52, Or you just like go around and crowd around the window.
5294.52,5295.52, We can all.
5295.52,5297.52, All like appear into the windows.
5297.52,5298.52, Like looking.
5298.52,5299.52, Yeah.
5299.52,5300.52, Like if they kick you.
5300.52,5301.52, Yes.
5301.52,5302.52, You're gonna.
5302.52,5303.52, Yeah.
5303.52,5304.52, It depends.
5304.52,5306.52, Some areas I've had where they've kicked me.
5306.52,5308.52, And it's like it might be from like a larger area.
5308.52,5310.52, And it kind of just drops you outside of it.
5310.52,5313.52, And it's see there's like a do not you can't enter.
5313.52,5314.52, Right.
5314.52,5315.52, Warning.
5315.52,5316.52, And others.
5316.52,5317.52, It's just a specific business.
5317.52,5320.52," And like yeah, we've been able to go up and chill at the window."
5320.52,5322.52, But they would have to build in their own windows.
5322.52,5323.52, Like that's something they would allow.
5323.52,5324.52, Yeah.
5324.52,5326.52, They would want people to watch us do this crap.
5326.52,5327.52, Yeah.
5327.52,5329.52, The other thing too that you could do the fun of.
5329.52,5334.52, And just when you have it's all the secret isn't having the most messed up character that you can make.
5334.52,5336.52, But you want to do it within limits too.
5336.52,5337.52, Because some of the guys.
5337.52,5343.52, That play with their characters is just so completely dumb looking that it's like what it what even is that.
5343.52,5345.52, Like not even like nature.
5345.52,5346.52, Not human.
5346.52,5348.52, Not such is not even that cruel.
5348.52,5349.52," You know, like yeah."
5349.52,5353.52, Like if you're you want to be human enough so that you're like the most nastiest human you so
5353.52,5354.52, And ever seen.
5354.52,5357.52, But you're still qualified as a human.
5357.52,5362.52, And then then you do in another thing like I went to this like some kind of like Latin dance thing.
5362.52,5364.52, Maybe like a big dance for everyone's dancing.
5364.52,5367.52, Like all synchronized doing the same thing.
5367.52,5369.52, You go in there and start dancing with them.
5369.52,5375.52, And it's like one of these kids is doing his own thing because all of them are like in pretty dresses and suits and stuff.
5375.52,5377.52, Except for me.
5377.52,5382.52, So I wonder other people.
5382.52,5386.52, They were on the other people playing it like you like you were the only.
5386.52,5387.52, You were the only ones dude.
5387.52,5390.52, We were the only ones that look that were I know other people.
5390.52,5393.52, It's not like we're the only ones because I've seen yeah.
5393.52,5395.52," Yeah, I got to be plenty of other people grieving."
5395.52,5399.52, But the whole time we were in we were the only ones that were like that messed up everyone else.
5399.52,5403.52, They were they were more in my mind like the big guy that was like a minitar thing.
5403.52,5408.52, He was more messed up to me because he was serious about he was serious about he was going to make a minitar with the
5408.52,5409.52, Bona that's what I want to be.
5409.52,5410.52, But he wants to.
5410.52,5411.52, This is aspiration.
5411.52,5415.52, And then are you with people when they make fun of my minitar the Bona.
5415.52,5419.52, Like that guy is more messed up by far than this but I don't think this is where he does in VMA.
5419.52,5422.52, At least he has up there's a place for him in the world now.
5422.52,5424.52," Yeah, he didn't have this before."
5424.52,5425.52, Right.
5425.52,5426.52, It's trying to do this in real life.
5426.52,5427.52, He's up a problem.
5427.52,5428.52, Here he can be.
5428.52,5430.52, Second life whatever the hell he wants.
5430.52,5431.52, Right.
5431.52,5432.52, He can't.
5432.52,5433.52, I'm happy for him.
5433.52,5435.52, All your finances come true there.
5435.52,5436.52, Minitar man.
5436.52,5437.52, You go.
5437.52,5438.52, I say.
5438.52,5440.52, I wait away from me.
5440.52,5441.52, Don't do it.
5441.52,5443.52, But you go.
5443.52,5444.52, You don't have to go in the club.
5444.52,5447.52, So what do we have anything else?
5447.52,5448.52, Where do we go from here?
5448.52,5449.52, I don't know.
5449.52,5451.52, We may just leave after this.
5451.52,5452.52, Like for a bit.
5452.52,5455.52," Well, we have legendary thread coming up."
5455.52,5456.52, Yeah.
5456.52,5457.52," I mean, any minute."
5457.52,5458.52, Talk to someone knocks on the door.
5458.52,5459.52, We can.
5459.52,5460.52, We had a couple of items.
5460.52,5463.52, I was fucking asshole so much and very threat of coming in.
5463.52,5464.52," Oh, wait."
5464.52,5465.52, So much.
5465.52,5466.52, That's awesome.
5466.52,5470.52, What more do we have?
5470.52,5472.52," Oh, right."
5472.52,5475.52, We can go back to Ryan's tail of the cock.
5475.52,5476.52, Yeah.
5476.52,5477.52, Great.
5477.52,5482.52, So he was just up like a minute to her.
5482.52,5484.52, The tail of cock is actually.
5484.52,5486.52, I just up like a rooster.
5486.52,5487.52, Right.
5487.52,5491.52, It actually relates to a game cock and Mike Wilson.
5491.52,5497.52," If you didn't see the story over the weekend,"
5497.52,5501.52, there was a fairly epic flame war between Mike Wilson and Jon or Maro.
5501.52,5506.52," Because I, on storm, is just the cluster fuck that keeps on giving man."
5506.52,5512.52," Ten years later, ten years later, it's still the fallout continues."
5512.52,5516.52, And I found this story to be a little bit sad actually.
5516.52,5519.52," I was sort of, you know, I sent you guys to link over the weekend."
5519.52,5521.52," And I was like, oh, let's read these out loud."
5521.52,5523.52," But really, we're crying inside."
5523.52,5524.52, I was crying.
5524.52,5525.52, Yeah.
5525.52,5526.52," Actually, I did a little bit."
5526.52,5528.52, I had to have my wife hold me.
5529.52,5531.52, The bike quilt is so big.
5531.52,5537.52," It's just, you know, this company, give us a history lesson."
5537.52,5538.52, Give me a reminder.
5538.52,5546.52," History lesson, which is that my way back in 1996, Mike Wilson,"
5546.52,5556.52," Jon or Maro, Tom Hall, left it where they worked very successfully on doom and quake and other projects."
5556.52,5558.52, And they formed ion storm.
5558.52,5562.52, But most of what we know about ion storm is kind of the rest of history.
5562.52,5564.52, I don't have to blast around about that.
5564.52,5568.52," We know, you know, the nightmare that was dikatana,"
5568.52,5570.52, we know all the ludicrousness over there.
5570.52,5575.52," They're, they're idiotic, PR attempts, the suck at downbed,"
5575.52,5576.52, and all that stuff.
5576.52,5584.52," And I mean, basically, this was the company that started off poorly and then imploded."
5584.52,5588.52, So hard to imagine weren't specter working with these guys.
5588.52,5590.52," Well, he wasn't part of the indifference group."
5590.52,5591.52, Yeah.
5591.52,5597.52, And he was a real savior to the name of ion storm.
5597.52,5601.52," The ASX, at least gave them, you know, some credibility."
5601.52,5605.52, It had nothing to do with all the guys from the original company.
5605.52,5606.52, Right.
5606.52,5612.52," Though I will say, and I've said it before, that Tom Hall's an acronox is a brilliant and overlooked game."
5612.52,5615.52," So, Iron Storm, that was the last official release of my instrument."
5615.52,5616.52, I love that game.
5616.52,5620.52, But it was too little too late at that point.
5620.52,5626.52, But the stories about the mismanagement that went on at Iron Storm were fairly legendary.
5626.52,5628.52, We heard them all the time.
5628.52,5631.52, It was obvious from the constant delays in the game.
5631.52,5639.52, The the the the the fudes between these guys who were all designers and not managers originally when they were at it.
5639.52,5648.52, It was a classic argument of why you actually need like management and administrative people in a group of artistic type people.
5648.52,5649.52, Yeah.
5649.52,5652.52, Because some people are better in certain something than others.
5652.52,5662.52," And so these guys imploded in Michaelson left in 1997 to start gathering of developers, which lasted until oh gosh."
5662.52,5667.52," I want to say 2000, 2001 or so."
5667.52,5674.52," And then he went on to form something called substance TV, which was this DVD magazine."
5674.52,5676.52, I didn't know if you remember that whole era.
5676.52,5677.52, I don't remember that.
5677.52,5680.52, People thought it was a good idea to put magazines on CDs or DVDs.
5680.52,5684.52, So that lasted a whopping seven issues and then that went belly up.
5684.52,5689.52," And now he's at game cock, of course, and they put theory out a little while ago."
5689.52,5696.52," So, but you know, this guy is an notorious kind of."
5697.52,5699.52, And what do you want to say?
5699.52,5705.52," He's kind of a joke, Stern, allowed mouth and then a dragon quest jokes."
5705.52,5707.52," Yeah, you know, he was."
5707.52,5710.52," He was, yeah, he tried to guess the spell."
5710.52,5714.52, He was in the news a little while ago because of the spike TV awards.
5714.52,5716.52, Is that right? It was those awards.
5716.52,5718.52," Yeah, he and the game cock guys crashed."
5718.52,5721.52, They crashed the party at the spike TV awards.
5721.52,5727.52," Right when Ken Levine was accepting an award for Bioshock for Game of the Year, actually."
5727.52,5733.52, And these guys crashing went on stage and spouted some nonsense.
5733.52,5738.52, And then had to issue a public apology the next day for being so immature.
5738.52,5740.52," That's just, that's just who these guys are."
5740.52,5745.52," You know, it's kind of frat party, you know, with these guys well into their 30s."
5745.52,5750.52," But whatever, I'm certainly casting those songs in that after a few days."
5750.52,5751.52, And so I'd like to ask if they were the best songs of the game.
5751.52,5753.52, Then I'd like to ask if they were the best songs in that after after this podcast.
5753.52,5759.52," Which is not about the image, he's just started with John Romero."
5759.52,5766.52," Right, so the origin of of this late, as around is that, you know, these guys have been on the outs."
5766.52,5769.52," The original iron storm guys for many, many years."
5769.52,5773.52, They went there on separate directions Mike Wilson went long way.
5773.52,5775.52, John Romero went the other.
5775.52,5777.52, And what happened over the weekend was.
5777.52,5787.360000000001," was Romero posted, oh gosh, was it on his own website? I may get this wrong and I apologize,"
5787.360000000001,5794.240000000001, but I printed it out here what Romero's response was to the fact that Mike Wilson announced
5794.240000000001,5802.96," the release schedule for the upcoming GameCock games, which includes such titles as Hail to"
5803.04,5808.64," the Chimp, the box, what else did they get working on that ninja?"
5808.64,5816.24," Sure, man, much of men. Anyway, a bunch of really winning sanding titles and Romero posted this."
5817.12,5820.88," So over what I meant that for real, I'm looking forward to head out of the champ."
5820.88,5823.76," There were no scarecrots there. Yeah, not America. I meant it."
5825.52,5828.56, So John and Mayor wrote this. I'll read the whole thing because his is shorter. The
5828.56,5834.8," Michael, some thing goes on, is an epic ribotl, but Romero's goes like this. So over on Cataku,"
5834.8,5839.76," they have a news item about GameCock's release schedule. Once again, just like with Godgames,"
5839.76,5844.320000000001, Wilson is taking all the all the credit away from the indie devs and pasting his ass and
5844.320000000001,5849.280000000001, I logo everywhere. I got a chuckle out of reading the readers comments on the article.
5849.280000000001,5854.0," People are now starting to get a clue about how Mr. Wilson operates. Hey, everyone, he hasn't"
5854.08,5858.48, changed in over 10 years. These are the kinds of jackass stunts he pulled at Ion Storm with
5858.48,5865.92," Diketana. Remember the bitch had? Yeah. He also ran ads that just had pictures of Ion Storm founders,"
5865.92,5872.16," himself and our COO. That was just the beginning of his madness. It got much worse at Godgames,"
5872.16,5876.72," or he pretty much just partied all the time. And after the whole thing got ramed in by take two,"
5876.72,5882.24," he went underground for a while, waiting for his next victim investor so he could go hog wild all over"
5882.24,5889.679999999999," again. And thus was born GameCock. So, you know, Romero posts us out of the blue. Yeah. And in"
5890.639999999999,5895.2," Sean's making a face and it really does beg the questions like, man, you don't want to be thrown"
5895.2,5902.16," stunts when you're John Romero. Yeah, you're really just done. And you don't have to know a whole lot"
5902.16,5909.92," about the history of Ion Storm to know that especially as John Romero, you don't want to be"
5912.24,5918.719999999999, casting blame for the failures of that company on the other guys. Right. But Mike Wilson saw
5918.719999999999,5925.36, this post and then he wrote a response that was just it's just utterly brutal. It's just rips
5925.36,5933.599999999999," him apart. He ten ways to Sunday is clowning on how many divorces Romero has had, how many"
5933.599999999999,5941.2, bastard children that he literally has. Yeah. How many bad breast implants that he's paid for. Right.
5941.28,5946.5599999999995," You got to have as many ways. So far as to offer, he says that if like Romero's most recent"
5947.92,5954.0," lover, who's a Hungarian, ditches him, then he'll hook him up. I guess he's in Russia. Wilson"
5954.0,5958.72," wasn't Russia at the time of writing. And he says, now hook you up with a Russian. Right. If you"
5958.72,5965.12," write, he gets very personal life. I mean, that's an idea for how personal this is. It's a case study"
5965.12,5970.88, that you could download and keep his boilerplate for how to write a flame. That's he rips him. Yeah.
5970.88,5977.04," A new one so hard. And you know, the beginning just the very beginning of it already, which is"
5977.76,5983.04," dear John, I'm writing this letter from Moscow, having just read your lovely post about me,"
5983.04,5988.0, which a good friend forwarded me and implored me to reply to. I really never thought I would
5988.0,5993.68," relive the joy that was Ion storm, circa 1997, or that the memories of those times still"
5993.68,5999.12," troubled you so much 11 years later. Then again, I would guess you live in the memories of"
5999.2,6004.96, your 20s as much as you can given the reality of your 30s. Glad to know I'm still in your thoughts.
6005.92,6018.08," So that's that's the first paragraph. I'm scanning because, uh, yeah. You know,"
6018.08,6023.84," even when I read it. It's bad. But most recently, the Romero replied again to this and sort of just"
6023.84,6028.24," like the high road and just said, actually ended it with like I look forward to seeing to"
6028.24,6034.32," look forward to seeing the the game caught games. Well, I took that as pretty fescious. Yeah. Right."
6034.32,6039.84," But he, he was very like, okay, this is it. We don't need to continue to."
6039.84,6043.2," Well, actually, let me I'll read you the conclusion. I read you the the beginning and then the"
6043.2,6048.400000000001," conclusion of well some of the last sentences. Uh, you take care now and remember just because"
6048.4,6052.639999999999, it id idos and then midway fired you doesn't mean you're not still awesome.
6053.599999999999,6060.96," So suck it down. You're pal. So, but what's sad to me is like these guys actually used to be friends."
6060.96,6065.839999999999, They used to be business partners. The company ended 10 years ago. Yeah. And now they're having this
6065.839999999999,6070.08," public bitch fest in which neither of them frankly looks good. Right. You know, I mean,"
6070.08,6075.599999999999, certainly you got to understand Mike Wilson's desire to respond. Yeah. Of a Romero's pretty
6075.68,6082.96," pointless and unprovoked, uh, you know, little little jab, jab at him. Right. Absolutely."
6082.96,6089.120000000001," It's just asking for it. Mike Wilson, like, I mean, the people this name can't see this tail of"
6089.120000000001,6094.0," the cockbook that I'm holding up. It's like dude, when you're this dude, this picture's in this book."
6094.400000000001,6099.120000000001, You don't you just you've you've given up your right to ever make a post like that.
6099.2,6108.32," Like really. Well, I'm just yeah, this book. I am. Yeah. I mean, you know, the game cock is not."
6108.32,6114.4," Let me see that right. It's not holding themselves up as, you know, mature kind of, uh,"
6114.4,6120.64," you know, elder statesman of the gaming industry again. Um, did they ever claim they were going?"
6120.64,6126.0," But I don't know. I, yeah, but I don't think they did. I mean, I think maybe what I would like to say about"
6126.08,6131.92," this whole thing is like, I wish they would all just go away. Yeah. Just go away. Make a game."
6131.92,6137.04, It all just makes me cringe. Yeah. It's very immature stuff that that does be involved in this.
6137.04,6140.56, It was was Mike Wilson actually in the group that crashed the this fight TV.
6141.36,6146.96, I don't think he was personally invading with some other game cockers. Okay.
6148.4,6153.68," And again, it's a little bit hard to cast a spursons on the maturity level of the gaming industry"
6153.76,6158.72, when you got after the podcast that we just had. Take a little bit back. Let's just
6158.72,6163.4400000000005, in the second life. This starts all real. It all happened. Yeah.
6164.4800000000005,6170.400000000001, Does it mean it's good? I'm ashamed. You should be young man. Don't be ashamed.
6170.400000000001,6174.16, That don't be ashamed. We're all going to downlight second life. So truth. Yeah.
6175.04,6180.0," Yeah, I can't apologize. It was pretty fun to to see that thing I made. I do an appold dance."
6180.56,6185.84, I really do want to see it myself. I don't think you're. I don't think we can
6185.84,6192.88," tell this. This, these photos or video on the and any safe game. And I want to take videos, man."
6192.88,6198.32," Oh my gosh. I'm saying like we were like literally to the point, you know, when you laugh so hard"
6198.32,6203.44, when you're crying and you had to like turn off the like turn off the vent for a minute and just like
6203.44,6208.88, get your breath back. When you first see what you could do to your characters and the stuff that
6208.96,6215.4400000000005," and when you see them in these positions like someone, it all just comes back to me giving more"
6215.4400000000005,6220.88," anecdotes of this. You know, like there will be a couple people engaged in, you know,"
6220.88,6226.400000000001, or gs to execs and there's like another opening up in the front. So you can go in and pop in there.
6226.400000000001,6229.92," And again, it's like the ultimate form of party crashing, right? But then you zoom in and you're"
6229.92,6234.64, character when they when they do the animations that even give us a far as to animate your face
6235.280000000001,6240.08," and it's supposed to be, you know, an X to see or whatever. And so like in this, I joined in this"
6240.8,6245.360000000001, this orgiting and my character's like looking over at the guy next to me and it's got like the most
6245.360000000001,6250.08, gross bug guys with giant eyelashes and like still sucking the straw from the beer hat.
6250.8,6256.08, It looks over him and it's just like that eyelashes at the other guy who's also
6257.4400000000005,6262.320000000001," involved in the what do you do? Just like right click on an attached point or something. Yeah, just jump right on"
6262.32,6266.48, there it goes. And then there might be other options too. Like so while that'll just get you
6266.48,6272.0," ready to open right away. But then there might be other options in the radio menu. Yeah, like to do"
6272.0,6276.96, different styles and make different sounds and then they'll be talking to each other as it's going
6276.96,6283.28," making their own sounds and stuff. It's pretty uh, something else. It's the ultimate"
6283.28,6289.5199999999995," advantage generator. No, I hate it. You like it. I just think oh my god, dude, my mom and release"
6289.6,6295.200000000001, this thing. You can think about that dude. You get a lot of explaining to do.
6299.200000000001,6302.8," Okay, now we know how to hold this over Sean. Yeah, I'm going to tell you about it."
6303.4400000000005,6310.72, Are we done for this week? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it. I'll feel worn out.
6311.4400000000005,6317.360000000001," Like to log out of this. I'm worried about where you out of my story. Flash quid. Okay, let's wrap it up"
6317.679999999999,6323.92," in frogs. It says goodbye. Okay, frogs is just going to take us out this week. We'll see you next week."
6324.96,6329.5199999999995," Frogs makes us squealing noise. Yeah, frogs does."
