0.0,4.0, JAROSTA FARI.
4.0,7.0, Welcome to GFW radio.
7.0,9.0, This is...
9.0,13.0," I don't know why I did that, but I did it."
13.0,14.0, We're not re-recording.
14.0,15.0," Two later, no."
15.0,16.0, What date is it?
16.0,18.0," August 27th, 2007."
18.0,20.0, August 28th.
20.0,21.0, Take a day.
21.0,23.0, One of those two days.
23.0,26.0, And we're here as usual because what else would we be?
26.0,29.0," If not here, I ask you."
29.0,30.0, You.
30.0,36.0," And I'm here with the usual crew of SHFW radio, which are amongst the following."
36.0,37.0," Right, I'm Scott."
37.0,38.0, Daring the last one.
38.0,39.0, Sean Elliott.
39.0,40.0, Sean Malloy.
40.0,41.0," Hi, everyone."
41.0,42.0, Hello.
42.0,43.0, Hi.
43.0,47.0," So I was in San Diego for four days, which no one really cares about."
47.0,50.0," And I don't have much to say about that, because I was totally offline."
50.0,51.0, Didn't play games.
51.0,54.0," Didn't use my laptop, didn't check email, whatever."
54.0,56.0, But I wanted to share this one anecdote.
57.0,59.0," My entire family are, uh,"
59.0,60.0," uh,"
60.0,61.0, Jin Rummy addicts.
61.0,63.0," So whenever we have, this is a family we're unique."
63.0,65.0, And I go to every year.
65.0,69.0, And so there's always these like competitive card games going on all the whole time.
69.0,77.0," And the winner every year, including this year is my great aunt, whose 88 years old."
77.0,78.0, Doesn't that rock?
78.0,79.0, She's running its tables.
79.0,82.0," Doesn't that, doesn't that warm your, like, your cockles?"
82.0,84.0, Pretty fun.
85.0,86.0, 88.
86.0,89.0, And still in the general age.
89.0,93.0," Still, and still winning kicking everybody's ass all the way down to to my kid,"
93.0,98.0," who's 13 all the way up to my brother, who's 40 something."
98.0,100.0, She's still wins.
100.0,101.0, It's tempting.
101.0,103.0," She played what else you didn't say in Diego,"
103.0,104.0," since I went to high school there, but."
104.0,106.0," Uh, they get that's like some serious tension."
106.0,107.0," Yeah, that didn't."
107.0,109.0, Did you go to any traveling carnivals?
109.0,112.0, I sat on my ass and I read a biography of Peter the Great.
112.0,113.0, Did you go to TJ?
113.0,117.0," So do you think you're still being a good, a table in your 88?"
117.0,118.0, Got them right.
118.0,119.0, It will be.
119.0,120.0, Take on my little one.
120.0,121.0, It's like a bicycle.
121.0,123.0, Yeah.
123.0,125.0, Anybody else want to say what they did this weekend?
125.0,128.0," Now that we're playing sort of like, shall we tell?"
128.0,132.0," I'll back it up real quick, since now that we've already got off the tracks."
132.0,133.0, Yeah.
133.0,134.0, I visited it.
134.0,138.0," There weren't out of my parents and Idaho, and before everyone sort of jawed"
138.0,139.0," off, they said, what the hell you're from Idaho?"
139.0,140.0," No, I'm not from Idaho."
140.0,143.0, My parents moved their retirement type stuff.
143.0,144.0, And I visited them.
144.0,147.0, And we went to this theme park called Silverwood.
147.0,150.0," And it's like, I don't know, man."
150.0,155.0, Idaho theme park mentioned basically all their rides are inherited from traveling carnivals.
155.0,156.0, They're actually a carnival.
156.0,161.0," And through the speakers throughout the place, they have playing like a fiddle version of"
161.0,164.0," Led Zeppelin, entire way through there."
164.0,167.0," So whatever, like you got in your mind about Idaho,"
167.0,168.0, it's probably pretty true.
168.0,171.0, Other than the fact that it's really beautiful at the same time.
171.0,176.0," But so looking at all these rides, I was just like, I don't know, man."
176.0,180.0," So these are kind of old rides, or basically like you take engineering one-on-one students"
180.0,185.0," and tell them like figure out how to, as many ways as you can to make someone spin."
185.0,186.0, Yeah.
186.0,187.0, And not kill them.
187.0,191.0," No, but how the best ways you can make someone spin with a machine that you could put"
191.0,194.0, together with like basically no education.
194.0,196.0, And like scrap metal.
196.0,198.0," Sorry, it's more than I can do."
198.0,199.0, So I take that back carnies.
199.0,205.0," But in this just weird, you know, there's always like the guy taking your tickets for the rides."
205.0,207.0, Got like one hand missing or something.
207.0,211.0," And then you start trying to figure out how that happened and you look and then, oh,"
211.0,213.0," you see there's a funny house, but it's a trailer."
213.0,216.0," And then you say, okay, well, it's probably also a meth lab."
216.0,219.0, And there's a big hole in the back of the haunted house trailer.
219.0,222.0, And that's probably when the meth lab blew up and took the guys hand and got them
222.0,224.0, relocated to the tilt the world.
225.0,226.0," Oh, yeah."
226.0,229.0," I think if I was going to get on the suspicious looking roller coaster, I want to go on the one being"
229.0,232.0, man by guy with a limb missing.
232.0,234.0, Is that must be safe?
234.0,238.0, I used to take on the damn carnival rides whenever the carnival would come to town.
238.0,241.0, I'd always bring like a bag and I'd put milk and hot dog chunks in it.
241.0,243.0, And maybe like a few pieces of bread.
243.0,245.0, So it's so it's so up it up.
245.0,246.0, Peace super.
246.0,248.0, You know how there's like this swing.
248.0,251.0, It's like totally busted and it goes into circle.
251.0,255.0," Like it's on chains and they kind of swing out, but then the line goes into circle around the"
255.0,257.0, perimeter and everyone's around.
257.0,262.0," So it's great to just throw it off the swing, open up the bag of milk and hot dog chunks."
262.0,267.0," And then like the same thing, like you know when you get out, you get out of the zipper"
267.0,268.0, wherever before you hop out real quick.
268.0,270.0, Just don't that down on the bottom.
270.0,272.0," But so yeah, that's the carnival for you."
272.0,275.0," Oh, yeah, one last thing on the carnival rides because I brought this up to a friend"
275.0,280.0," and he pointed out that in Denver, they have, I forget the name of the theme park."
280.0,283.0, So it's one of six flags and now they've got this ride.
283.0,289.0," It's basically a giant half pipe and imagine this huge ridiculous, like completely"
289.0,294.0," S9 skateboard and then there are seats, these pods of seat clusters and they spin around"
294.0,298.0," as the big skateboards doing the half pipe there, like spinning around at the same time."
298.0,299.0, Wow.
299.0,301.0," Well, it's a modified version of like the zipper or something."
301.0,302.0, I've seen that.
302.0,303.0, Now it's not like the zipper at all.
303.0,307.0," Well, the zipper is like they basically, we're breaking the shit down."
307.0,308.0, This is what I want to do.
308.0,310.0, I'll get that shit fun.
310.0,312.0," With the zipper, the zipper is just something different."
312.0,314.0," Look it up, do Google image men."
314.0,316.0, Put meth lab plus zipper.
316.0,317.0, I don't get your right.
317.0,319.0, What do we got to talk about?
319.0,321.0," Well, we're going to talk about fire shock."
321.0,325.0, I'll say I'll print at the top of this podcast at the end of this podcast.
325.0,332.0, The two shons who are the only ones who are cool enough smart enough and responsible enough
332.0,337.0, to finish fire shock are going to do a little spoiler extra.
337.0,341.0, And the spoiler extravaganza extravacupalosa at the end of this podcast.
341.0,342.0, We're going to break it down.
342.0,346.0, So we'll have a big warning there before they actually start talking.
346.0,349.0," Actually, Darren and Ryan and I won't even be in the room anymore."
349.0,351.0, Because we don't want to be spoiled.
351.0,352.0, So that's the end of the evening.
352.0,353.0, I'm warning.
353.0,355.0," How far are you, by the way?"
355.0,357.0, I've only had two play sessions.
357.0,359.0, I'm only I just killed the first big daddy.
359.0,361.0, So I'm still way early on.
361.0,362.0, I'm only about halfway through.
362.0,364.0," So I guess I was on vacation, so."
364.0,365.0, How would you know your halfway through date?
365.0,367.0," Well, I check with him a lot."
367.0,369.0, He said I'm roughly about halfway through.
369.0,371.0, So that's all I need to know.
371.0,376.0, So we're going to so they'll talk about that later up front.
376.0,382.0, Why don't we go over some of the big issues involving the PC release?
382.0,387.0, Because I was probably the top story of the week for PC news.
387.0,390.0, Lots of kind of achy stuff there.
390.0,393.0, And I know we talked to Ken Levine at one up here.
393.0,398.0, And so let's talk about that instead of talking about talking about it.
398.0,399.0, Yeah.
399.0,401.0, That's getting straight into it.
401.0,403.0, Attack of the rage notes.
403.0,406.0, You want to hit a hit on hit on that part of the first or what actually just got hit that up.
406.0,407.0," Yeah, it's over there."
407.0,411.0," So I mean, the technical troubles involving the PC issue."
411.0,413.0," I mean, someone were legitimate."
413.0,417.0," Some of them weren't troubles, but just things that people weren't expecting"
417.0,419.0, and didn't react well to.
419.0,422.0," And you know, annoying, like the there's a limit."
422.0,424.0," If you didn't get the steam version if you bought the box,"
424.0,428.0, Carby that you can have two installs per purchase.
428.0,433.0," However, it turned out though, right, that if you uninstall it, then you get your install back."
433.0,434.0, But that was the idea.
434.0,435.0, That was the general idea.
435.0,438.0, The problem was that I guess Ken told us this.
438.0,441.0," He said, basically, they weren't prepared for the amount of success that they had."
441.0,444.0," So like, like there's kind of like 1.5 life to first launched."
444.0,447.0," You know, steam was like the steam servers were kind of backed up."
447.0,449.0," The same kind of thing apparently was happening on the back end,"
449.0,451.0, where there's supposed to be registering.
452.0,454.0, Uninstall of bio shock.
454.0,457.0, It feels like with all due respect.
457.0,459.0, So it feels like a bit of a horseshit answer.
459.0,464.0," I mean, how could you not expect a crush on this game that's been hyped and everyone"
464.0,467.0," knew is going to be one of the people you know, even John Davis."
467.0,470.0," One of yours was saying, oh, it's not going to do well."
470.0,472.0, It'll be critical darling and it's not going to do well.
472.0,473.0," Yeah, what to see now."
473.0,474.0, He doesn't work anymore.
475.0,481.0," But yeah, but so there's that there was issues with ATI compatibility."
481.0,482.0, That's been hot fixed.
482.0,485.0, I'm still in problems with that actually.
485.0,486.0, You are.
486.0,488.0," Yeah, the hot fixes out, but I'm still trying to like, I don't,"
488.0,490.0, maybe because I have this early test machine.
490.0,492.0," I'm playing with right now, but I'm still running to the same issues,"
492.0,495.0, but I'm working on it with the tech support.
495.0,497.0," There's their, you know, anti piracy,"
497.0,499.0, sucky wrong stuff was on there.
499.0,501.0," And then that later became this,"
502.0,506.0," I don't know, it's just like this, this internet virus where you go into a forum"
506.0,509.0," and you try to be the first to post that, you know, there's a root kit that it"
509.0,513.0," this game installed on your computer turns out to my knowledge that in fact,"
513.0,514.0, there's not.
514.0,516.0," I mean, Seki Ram has got all this stuff associated with it."
516.0,517.0, That's annoying.
517.0,518.0, It's not a root kit though.
518.0,521.0," It's not quite, you know, root kit bad."
521.0,523.0," But the point I wanted to make, I mean,"
523.0,526.0," all this all week long, this was happening."
526.0,528.0," You know, seeing the threads, people on my instant,"
528.0,531.0," that mess, messenger list, we're hitting me up like with this,"
531.0,533.0," you know, this moral indignation."
533.0,534.0," Oh, my God, did you hear about this?"
534.0,535.0, Did you hear about this?
535.0,539.0," And at some point, you know, it just bugged me because, you know,"
539.0,541.0, this is the rage getting back to the rage not syndrome.
541.0,544.0," And I think that with the way games,"
544.0,548.0," discussion goes nowadays with message boards and blogs,"
548.0,551.0," and everyone is so desperate to say, look at me,"
551.0,556.0," get in this thread, and then also just to be like outraged at something"
556.0,559.0, that every week there's going through something.
559.0,563.0," And then that just becomes, okay, this is the focus of our rage this week."
563.0,566.0," And I think that week, I mean, I'm not dismissing,"
566.0,569.0," I mean, some of those individually are legitimate and they're annoying,"
569.0,572.0," but none of it, but nor are any of these things new."
572.0,575.0," It's like if you're a PC gamer and a big game comes out,"
575.0,577.0, like when has it ever been fucking flawless?
577.0,579.0, When has it ever been perfect?
579.0,582.0," Right. And so much of it gets resolved a week later,"
582.0,583.0, whatever.
583.0,587.0," The bottom line is, I mean, it's easy for me to say because it worked fine."
587.0,589.0, It worked splendidly on my computer home.
589.0,592.0," I didn't have a single issue and it's like, hey, I'm playing the game and I'm loving it."
592.0,595.0," Right. And for anyone that had an end of the day occurred,"
595.0,599.0," and only has told it once, which is probably most, most people that imagine."
599.0,601.0," Yeah, but if you would probably not have any problems."
601.0,605.0," Right. But I just think that to make a larger point about the internet rage,"
605.0,608.0," not syndrome, it's kind of annoying because, I mean, just check it."
608.0,610.0," I mean, if you're listening, I'd say if you listen to this podcast,"
610.0,613.0, you probably go into forums and check blogs and stuff too.
613.0,615.0," I mean, I'm assuming you're pretty hardcore like that."
615.0,618.0, And just look at the trend. You know what I mean?
618.0,620.0," And ask yourself, I mean, how serious is this stuff?"
620.0,623.0," It's like, it's our version of the, you know, lensy, low-hundred,"
623.0,625.0," did a fucking line or something, you know?"
625.0,626.0, I don't know.
626.0,628.0," You got to have something. I mean, they're like in Hollywood."
628.0,631.0," Like, if you're not talking about something substantial,"
631.0,633.0, let's turn something in subject.
633.0,636.0," I can always understand the frustration of like,"
636.0,639.0, because you've been waiting for this forever. You've finally got in your hands.
639.0,641.0," Like, there's just some small obstacle."
641.0,643.0," Whatever it is, it's in your way from enjoying this thing."
643.0,644.0, You've been waiting for this.
644.0,646.0," The people who pre-ordered it or pre-downloaded it,"
646.0,648.0, and then couldn't get that last 20% done.
648.0,650.0," I mean, that's got to be frustrating as hell."
650.0,653.0," That's the big feeling, I think, is that steam almost, like,"
653.0,658.0," I mean, for a lot of people at Crash, the day that they're pre-loaded,"
658.0,660.0, was supposed to have unlocked.
660.0,662.0," I mean, there was a point where I seen the screenshot,"
662.0,664.0," where steam years was downed like 4,000,"
664.0,666.0, which is like ridiculous.
666.0,668.0, That's pretty close to like catastrophic failure.
668.0,671.0," And that was puzzling to me because, I mean,"
671.0,674.0," Valve's kind of like had that never again after Half Life 2,"
674.0,676.0, and then here they are in a gin and a gin.
676.0,679.0," It's like, you know everything points to this being a big game."
679.0,682.0, They also know internally from how many people are pre-downloading it.
682.0,685.0, Just look at that stuff and work it out.
685.0,688.0, You're going to have to expect it to get.
688.0,689.0, What's up?
689.0,695.0," Sorry, I've just, just no religious, just got a dessert sticker on this 4-"
695.0,698.0," I'm promoting Gazzurque, like the half of the one up network."
698.0,699.0, On my forehead.
699.0,702.0," You know, okay, good. Sorry."
702.0,705.0," Anyway, I mean, that was disappointing to me to see,"
705.0,707.0, Valve kind of messed up on that one.
707.0,708.0, Yeah.
708.0,710.0," But it's, at the same time, it also does mean that,"
710.0,712.0," by a shock, selling really well."
712.0,713.0, So he's a news.
713.0,717.0," So let's parse at this install issue though,"
717.0,720.0," just a little bit more because, because I read that,"
720.0,724.0," that this issue of, you can only have two installs at one time,"
724.0,726.0," and when you uninstall, you get one back."
726.0,728.0," Like, that sounds groovy to me."
728.0,732.0," Like, that my own personal outrage got less and after I heard,"
732.0,733.0, you get it back.
733.0,734.0, Right.
734.0,736.0, But then I was reading this morning that that's not necessarily working.
736.0,737.0," No, it wasn't working."
737.0,740.0, It wasn't working as intended as the way they put it.
740.0,741.0, Is it now?
741.0,743.0," What they did is, or I don't know if they had, they done this yet,"
743.0,745.0, where they up to the number of installs you get to five.
745.0,746.0," The up to the number of installs to five,"
746.0,749.0," and they're also looking to create some kind of like,"
749.0,753.0," uh, many outlets in case it didn't register properly when it"
753.0,755.0," installed, it removes it from this."
755.0,756.0, I see.
756.0,757.0, So they're fixing it.
757.0,759.0," Yeah, they are actually putting,"
759.0,761.0, making it inserted effort to like do right.
761.0,764.0, So what happened to you just read format your computer without properly
764.0,765.0, uninstalling that?
765.0,767.0, That's actually part of the question I had.
767.0,769.0," Basically, that's one of the things that I'm looking into right now."
769.0,771.0," The stop-up fix was the email,"
771.0,774.0," secure on, which is another problem is that you were getting caught"
774.0,776.0," in like a circular loop where 2K would tell you to email,"
776.0,778.0, secure on to get that fixed and secure on with
778.0,780.0, tell you to email 2K to get that fixed.
780.0,782.0," That was one of the things I can talk about is like,"
782.0,784.0," yeah, that circular loop wasn't supposed to be happening."
784.0,786.0," So we kind of gave secure run more autonomy,"
786.0,789.0, whatever that means to fix the problem.
789.0,794.0," So it sounded like, you know, secure on was assuming 2K had to handle it"
794.0,797.0, but really 2K wanted secure on to handle it.
797.0,801.0," I haven't tried to fix it myself, so I don't know if it actually fixed,"
801.0,804.0, but they're well aware of their issues.
804.0,805.0, Yeah.
805.0,806.0, It sounds like they're on it.
807.0,808.0, Yeah.
808.0,810.0, I think your point earlier is totally right.
810.0,813.0," I mean, when, you know, as PC gamers, you know,"
813.0,817.0, there's no point in being naive and over self-righteous about this.
817.0,822.0," I mean, this is the way it goes for us and most of us are used to dealing with this issue."
822.0,826.0," To me, it's the problem though, it's just that if you're,"
826.0,828.0," even if you're a hardcore gamer,"
828.0,831.0, there may just come a point where
831.0,834.0," the difference in the versions may be,"
834.0,839.0," you know, it may be such that they're so close and there's not much of a difference to make"
839.0,842.0, that why not just take the easier option.
842.0,843.0, Right.
843.0,845.0, That's definitely a concern.
845.0,847.0," I think that, I mean, fortunately in this case,"
847.0,850.0," I mean, there is a big, there's still a big difference between the two versions."
850.0,852.0," I mean, it looks beautiful on a PC."
852.0,856.0," It looks, it looks, it's looking on a high MPC here at work."
856.0,859.0," And if you do have the opportunity at your house,"
859.0,861.0," sort of, a friend's house to see it,"
861.0,862.0, it's incredible.
862.0,866.0, It looks freaking great on a high MPC.
866.0,869.0," So there is that, and there's the control issues."
869.0,874.0," But gosh, you know, the game's been out a week or so."
874.0,877.0," And, you know, on the Xbox side,"
877.0,879.0, everyone's just talking about the game.
879.0,882.0," And on the PC side, everybody's just talking about the install."
882.0,883.0, It's a drag.
883.0,886.0," Well, until it's a, but that's my thing."
886.0,887.0," It's like, I even saw, you know,"
887.0,888.0, to name names.
888.0,894.0," I saw someone from another press thing, a certain Gary complaining about,"
894.0,896.0," you know, but PC, this is all trash."
896.0,898.0," And like, I'm doing the console one."
898.0,900.0, And then listing all the things we covered.
900.0,903.0," But then I was like, really, dude, did you have that many,"
903.0,905.0," did you have, did you run into every,"
905.0,907.0," yeah, one of those issues that you just listed?"
907.0,908.0, Right.
908.0,909.0, You fucking parody message boards.
909.0,910.0, Yeah.
910.0,912.0, I'm not dismissing those again.
912.0,914.0," But insofar as it mattered to you,"
914.0,916.0, like not a single one of those bothered me.
916.0,918.0," One, I didn't get the game in the first week,"
918.0,921.0, tried to install it on like a gigatown of fucking computers.
921.0,925.0," I don't run a cyber cafe and got pissed off because like,"
925.0,929.0," could populate it, my goddamn computers with one game."
929.0,931.0, I had the video card.
931.0,933.0," That was a big issue because I would be very,"
933.0,934.0, would have been set if I had a TI.
934.0,937.0," Very serious, but the fact that they were on it right away is good."
937.0,938.0, Right.
938.0,939.0, Yeah.
939.0,942.0," And the other stuff, I mean, like the, you know,"
943.0,945.0," Sekiro, Sekiro, Sekiro,"
945.0,946.0," whatever, Sekiro, Sekiro."
946.0,947.0," Sekiro, Sekiro."
947.0,950.0," Like, if it's not a root kid, it's not killing me of fine."
950.0,952.0, We're used to compromises all along anyway.
952.0,955.0, We have issues with punkbuster and all this other stuff.
955.0,959.0," And really, it was like, it didn't describe my experience."
959.0,962.0," I just, that's why I think for a lot of people."
962.0,963.0," Like in the same way that, you know,"
963.0,968.0, when there's like something going wrong with hardware on a console hardware
968.0,970.0," and the, the red ring of death,"
970.0,973.0, it's like you can't open any message board without seeing it in one of the top 10 posts.
973.0,974.0, Yeah.
974.0,976.0," It's definitely a real big issue in stuff, but at the same time,"
976.0,979.0, there's probably people that don't have a 360 and never had a 360 that
979.0,981.0, love posting in those.
981.0,982.0," And like, it's a good idea."
982.0,984.0, Updating people about it and stuff.
984.0,985.0," I don't know, just keep it."
985.0,988.0," No, definitely keep it in respect to Vemina and truth in a month or"
988.0,994.0, whenever this will be ancient history and all people will be talking about is the game.
994.0,995.0, Right.
995.0,996.0," Think about half life, too."
996.0,997.0, Like no one's going.
997.0,998.0, All right.
998.0,999.0, Half life.
999.0,1001.0," I was going to be a big way when half life,"
1001.0,1003.0, two first came out because I was one of the people.
1003.0,1004.0," And again, it's Sean."
1004.0,1006.0," It was like, it was a crapshoot that way."
1006.0,1010.0," Like if that wasn't your experience, you just thought half life, too, was awesome."
1010.0,1011.0, Right.
1011.0,1014.0," But if your experience was, you couldn't fucking play it because you couldn't"
1014.0,1016.0, activate your game because of steams problems.
1016.0,1017.0, It's dark when you thought it did suck.
1017.0,1018.0, And that was my problem.
1018.0,1019.0, And that speaks to it.
1019.0,1022.0," And that speaks to a larger problem about PC gaming and that,"
1022.0,1026.0, no one has the exact same spec setup.
1026.0,1028.0, So there's always going to be that one person who has the one.
1028.0,1030.0, Fucked up situation that just doesn't work.
1030.0,1033.0," I mean, I'm fortunate here when we were setting up for half for for"
1033.0,1035.0, BioShock.
1035.0,1037.0, I had a TI card to our test machine.
1037.0,1038.0, Wasn't working.
1038.0,1040.0," So I ripped him out, put it in video and worked great."
1040.0,1041.0, Not many.
1041.0,1042.0, Not many.
1042.0,1043.0, Exactly.
1043.0,1045.0, Because everyone has a whole arsenal of graphics cards that are disposal.
1045.0,1046.0, Right.
1046.0,1047.0, But I don't know.
1047.0,1049.0," I mean, like, what was another good example with Doc Messiah?"
1049.0,1052.0," Like, I was the only one who actually had a machine that worked with it."
1052.0,1053.0, Yeah.
1053.0,1054.0, That's right.
1054.0,1055.0, I think a couple of us couldn't play it all.
1055.0,1057.0, That did become a problem because what happened is they didn't get it.
1057.0,1058.0, Fixed it.
1058.0,1060.0, They're in the in the timeframe.
1060.0,1068.0," And that I mean, I think give it a little and if it goes a month and then beyond and it's still not addressed, then it's like you've moved on to the next big thing."
1068.0,1069.0, But here you got a high fix.
1069.0,1071.0, You're going to see how we can do this a week.
1071.0,1072.0, Yeah.
1072.0,1078.0," The only thing that would have prevented all of these, the only thing that would have prevented you from playing it is the ATI and that wouldn't even prevented you."
1078.0,1079.0, That was just some stuff with shadows.
1079.0,1080.0," Oh, no."
1080.0,1082.0," Actually, it was pretty unplayable."
1082.0,1083.0, Okay.
1083.0,1085.0, But then and then now they're on that now.
1085.0,1090.0," I mean, you could theoretically play it, but you couldn't see the enemies there invisible."
1090.0,1093.0, Like the water's of the mad.
1093.0,1094.0, Yeah.
1094.0,1095.0, The water was gone.
1095.0,1097.0," And in a city that's underwater, it's kind of hard to get."
1097.0,1100.0, Who's going to take care of the launch of the iPhone?
1100.0,1101.0, The recent launch of the iPhone.
1101.0,1106.0," You know, I mean, you know, there were some there's some issues at the beginning and it's like okay they're there."
1106.0,1109.0," You're either in the camp that's like okay, they got a quick fix."
1109.0,1110.0, I appreciate that.
1110.0,1112.0, I understand that this is complicated stuff.
1113.0,1120.0, Or you're the one who never wanted anything to do with iPhone in the first place and you've got some rival network and you just wanted to aim all your friends like.
1120.0,1121.0, And then post the space.
1121.0,1122.0, I hate it.
1122.0,1123.0, All right.
1123.0,1125.0," Certainly this can definitely bring out the, you know,"
1125.0,1126.0," Ah fuck, PC."
1126.0,1127.0, Femble is thing.
1127.0,1132.0," But yeah, I mean, the bottom line is is it looks great on."
1132.0,1133.0," Yeah, Sean Elliott."
1133.0,1134.0," No, it's not."
1134.0,1135.0," No, it's going to testify."
1135.0,1136.0, Is that it.
1136.0,1141.0, It looks great on PC and and though I haven't played on PC watching you guys play it.
1141.0,1143.0, It looks like I like it better.
1143.0,1148.0, I'll save that for for late when we get into it because I really love playing on the PC.
1148.0,1152.0," Yeah, you know, you know, you know, so much easier and just it's so much easier to control period."
1152.0,1156.0," Yeah, something related though is as I was firing it up,"
1156.0,1164.0, I found myself digging out like an old mouse and getting the batteries charged on it and I was like yeah this might be an other potential quick topic for us.
1164.0,1170.0, And that's like you have old hardware or something you're used to a certain mouse or keyboard or a chair that's a certain height or a
1170.0,1172.0, monitor that tilt to the certain angle.
1172.0,1181.0," And as soon as you mess with that like it just pisses you off, it's like you know you get your clutch redone on your car or something and it's just not the slips not the same and it's annoying."
1181.0,1187.0, And if it's a shooter or something that I want to be technically very proficient even more so multiplayer.
1187.0,1188.0, It's like I gotta have this mouse.
1188.0,1191.0," Now, I have several mice at home that are better."
1191.0,1193.0, There's a period that rechargeable.
1193.0,1196.0, They don't have the issue of me like always.
1196.0,1198.0," I mean, do people I play with would you testify?"
1198.0,1209.0," Like oh shit, hold on and then my voice goes out because I have to press mouse three to talk and teams speaker whatever and it's because the battery is died and I'm running to swap them from the rechargeer."
1209.0,1217.0, But it's like the thing fits me like a glove and I'm so used to it that I don't want to it's hard to say okay even this one's technically better.
1217.0,1219.0, I just I'm so used to the fin of that thing.
1219.0,1222.0, So I was wondering if you guys had anything like that.
1222.0,1224.0, I get that way with keyboards.
1224.0,1226.0, I think I can't stand it.
1226.0,1233.0, I keep trying to swap out my keyboard and every time I do I feel like here at work I feel like the keys are too mushy.
1233.0,1234.0, I can't stand it.
1234.0,1238.0, So I've got this keyboard here that is so grotesque.
1238.0,1240.0, I don't know if you've actually had people that are some fucking disgusting.
1240.0,1241.0, Have you listened to mine?
1241.0,1245.0," Yeah, it's like it's like a whole layer of crust on the key of the key."
1245.0,1249.0, It's like a keto dust and spilled cat hair at home on my home.
1249.0,1251.0, But you got that's so wonderful.
1251.0,1252.0, A keyboard.
1252.0,1254.0," Yeah, yeah, I've been collecting a whole key."
1254.0,1256.0, You didn't realize I've a whole draw for a keyboard.
1256.0,1257.0, Did it really that desperately?
1257.0,1258.0," Yeah, seriously."
1258.0,1259.0, I've told you.
1259.0,1260.0, Right after this.
1260.0,1261.0, You have so many here.
1261.0,1262.0, I'm the same way though.
1262.0,1263.0, I want to change keyboards either.
1263.0,1265.0, I got like that permagrine on mine too.
1265.0,1270.0, It's basically the fucking whiskey nerd scenario but like reality because yeah.
1270.0,1271.0, It's just nasty.
1271.0,1276.0," I mean, every time something's falling down in there a keto or something it just goes and lives in there."
1276.0,1278.0, I think they come out of my keyboard.
1278.0,1279.0, That's awesome.
1280.0,1281.0, I like Sean.
1283.0,1285.0, I had I had wait the food coming.
1285.0,1287.0, It got a whole family down here.
1287.0,1294.0, Or like your too lazy to even just get some dust off or like some windx and you just kind of like wipe it with your finger.
1294.0,1295.0, Got it wipe it.
1295.0,1296.0," Yeah, clean."
1296.0,1299.0, Which like get your shirt or try to get a napkin or something.
1299.0,1300.0, I have this one.
1300.0,1304.0," I have this one keyboard where like I kept like same thing a chito grip,"
1304.0,1311.0, tato chips and all that after after years of use like the keys are going to I can't actually see what the keys are anymore.
1311.0,1312.0, It's just like.
1312.0,1313.0," Yeah, grit."
1313.0,1314.0, WST.
1314.0,1320.0," I'm going to walk up my wife walking to our office at home and go like, how can you see in that monitor and I'll be like,"
1320.0,1321.0, What?
1321.0,1325.0," And then I'll take a closer look and it's like, oh yeah, I've like sneezed on it like first."
1325.0,1326.0, Yeah.
1326.0,1327.0, There's like drops of.
1327.0,1328.0, It's not.
1328.0,1331.0, And a screaming that knows you're playing guild leader.
1331.0,1332.0," Wow, just so live."
1332.0,1334.0," Yeah, we're not."
1334.0,1336.0, For dots.
1336.0,1339.0, I forgot what's going to say.
1339.0,1340.0, Whatever.
1340.0,1341.0, That's cool.
1341.0,1345.0," Rind you of a favorite, you know, keyboard mouse setup."
1345.0,1348.0, You're you're spending hours kind of poop socking your games.
1348.0,1350.0, What the hell.
1350.0,1355.0, I don't really have that kind of intent attachment like you guys do.
1355.0,1359.0," I mean, I replace my keyboard every."
1359.0,1362.0," You're a little bit like, you know, you know, when it gets to the point where I can't run."
1362.0,1363.0, How much that's pretty awesome.
1363.0,1364.0, That's probably going to do it.
1364.0,1365.0, I was going to say a bit of often.
1365.0,1367.0," I mean, I'm the, I'm like, I'm the hardware guy."
1367.0,1368.0, I get new keyboards all the time.
1368.0,1370.0, I don't change my keyboard the most.
1370.0,1371.0, Maybe it's like once a year.
1371.0,1376.0," I don't know, but it's, you know, I don't keep the same keyboard for like years at a time."
1376.0,1382.0, I'm still used to bouncing around between like mind and kids and like the one at work.
1382.0,1387.0," And then the other one at work and my laptop that like, yeah, I don't feel a touch."
1387.0,1388.0, I don't know if you can get that.
1388.0,1390.0," I mean, I do get annoyed when like the F."
1390.0,1392.0, The F row is a little higher and one than another one.
1392.0,1393.0," So I'm like, Oh, crap."
1393.0,1395.0, Or this thing that has a nice spot.
1395.0,1397.0, Very economically designed split keyboard.
1397.0,1398.0, I think the things.
1398.0,1401.0, They always have those at games studios when they go for previews and stuff.
1401.0,1403.0," I'm like, see you guys."
1403.0,1404.0, You guys.
1404.0,1405.0, I was never.
1405.0,1406.0, I was never.
1406.0,1407.0, I was never.
1407.0,1408.0, I was never.
1408.0,1409.0, I was never.
1409.0,1410.0, I was never.
1410.0,1411.0, I was never.
1411.0,1412.0, I was never.
1412.0,1413.0, I was never.
1413.0,1414.0, I was never.
1414.0,1415.0, I was never.
1415.0,1416.0, I was never.
1416.0,1417.0, I was never.
1417.0,1418.0, 5.
1418.0,1419.0, We all have these.
1419.0,1420.0, рок.
1420.0,1421.0, Ray and.
1421.0,1422.0, products.
1422.0,1426.0, And other social facts.
1426.0,1427.0, Guy that's.
1431.0,1432.0, You two.
1432.0,1435.0," Oh, I'm sorry,集 video."
1435.0,1437.0, As video of Ryan typing.
1437.0,1438.0, I had I have gotten.
1438.0,1439.0, I get I get I didn't always pray.
1439.0,1441.0, When someone for few of.
1441.0,1443.0, He has got he has me come for.
1443.0,1444.0, 25.
1444.0,1445.0, 20 feet away.
1445.0,1445.38, But.
1445.38,1448.38, I know that's the same topic.
1448.38,1452.38, Do you have any trouble gaming on a laptop?
1452.38,1454.38," Yeah, okay."
1454.38,1457.38, I'm just sending email on all the buttons.
1457.38,1459.38, What are you gaming?
1459.38,1461.38, I'm probably.
1461.38,1463.38, I'm usually wow.
1463.38,1465.38, But I do have trouble with it.
1465.38,1467.38," Well, the keyboard is so compressed."
1467.38,1469.38," If you have a desktop replacement keyboard,"
1469.38,1470.38," you know, no book."
1470.38,1473.38, They have like larger keyboard with the number pad that kind of helps.
1473.38,1475.38, But it's a most part like it's.
1475.38,1477.38, And I need a mouse plugged in.
1477.38,1479.38," Yeah, it's a little bit too hard."
1479.38,1480.38," Oh, you do."
1480.38,1481.38, Really?
1481.38,1482.38, Yes.
1482.38,1483.38," Because you can't really, and I don't know where it's bought."
1483.38,1487.38," Like I, I sit on the couch and just have the track ball on like the arm of the couch."
1487.38,1489.38, Because it don't have space to move a mouse to the street.
1489.38,1491.38, Is it one of those chairs with the track ball built in?
1491.38,1493.38, That'd be awesome.
1493.38,1495.38, I'm not that cool though.
1495.38,1497.38, Not that cool.
1497.38,1498.38, Yeah.
1498.38,1499.38, How cool that is.
1499.38,1502.38, I wouldn't want to track ball if I was playing like an FPS.
1502.38,1506.38, But then I wouldn't be playing FPS with like my laptop anyway.
1506.38,1507.38, Yeah.
1507.38,1510.38," And it's good for in precision games, you know,"
1510.38,1511.38, Galactic civilizations.
1511.38,1512.38, Yeah.
1512.38,1513.38, Wow.
1513.38,1514.38, I can't get some point.
1514.38,1517.38, I'll get to the point where my main computer is just a laptop.
1517.38,1519.38, But then I just really always find gaming.
1519.38,1522.38," And now you're, you need, if you're going to game, you need it."
1522.38,1524.38, I want the biggest desktop games.
1524.38,1525.38, Some games are needed.
1525.38,1527.38, Yeah.
1527.38,1528.38," Well, in the day, if the day ever comes,"
1528.38,1531.38, they have actually a reasonable like upgradability for no books.
1531.38,1534.38," They keep talking about it, but it's not quite there."
1534.38,1537.38, I don't understand why.
1537.38,1539.38," I don't know if they don't have a standard,"
1539.38,1541.38, they usually don't have a standardized chip.
1541.38,1544.38," You know, pin out so you can like camp, you replace one car with another."
1544.38,1545.38," You know, well, that's stupid."
1545.38,1546.38, Exactly.
1546.38,1550.38," And before I forget, Sean, so you mentioned your, your favorite, your favorite mouse with the"
1550.38,1551.38, tape around it?
1551.38,1552.38, Yeah.
1552.38,1553.38, Yeah.
1553.38,1554.38, The tape is because the battery case.
1554.38,1555.38, I lost that.
1555.38,1556.38, Which is it?
1556.38,1558.38, And so I have to tape this shit to hold it in there.
1558.38,1560.38, It's just some Microsoft one.
1560.38,1562.38," I've got, you know, thumb to pair thumb buttons."
1562.38,1564.38, And it just sits right.
1564.38,1566.38," I mean, they make some of these ones are so spacey and it's like the"
1566.38,1572.38, inset for your thumb goes too far in or the buttons are made for a smaller hand.
1572.38,1574.38, So they're set to back for me.
1574.38,1576.38," It's just like they, that's just the mouse for me."
1576.38,1577.38, I like that thing.
1577.38,1581.38, It's kind of like the difference for me between going now between a 360 controller and a
1581.38,1582.38, PS21.
1582.38,1585.38, I really don't like the PS26 axis controller.
1585.38,1586.38, I don't know.
1586.38,1587.38, I hate it.
1587.38,1588.38, Part of that's the shape.
1588.38,1589.38, It's just the analog.
1589.38,1590.38, It's substantial.
1590.38,1591.38, It is too.
1591.38,1594.38," Just put some fucking lead in there or something because it's like a, you know,"
1594.38,1596.38, I'll hold them piece of paper.
1596.38,1597.38, What you came.
1597.38,1598.38, Yeah.
1598.38,1599.38, What's the analog sticks just don't feel right?
1599.38,1600.38, The analog sticks don't feel right.
1600.38,1601.38, Yeah.
1601.38,1602.38, They're cheesy.
1602.38,1603.38, This feels too loose.
1603.38,1604.38, Feeling.
1604.38,1605.38, Yeah.
1605.38,1608.38," And they shouldn't be like they should be cubs not, uh, you know,"
1608.38,1609.38, context.
1609.38,1610.38, Yeah.
1610.38,1612.38, So your thumbs kind of like slip into a more.
1612.38,1613.38, Yeah.
1613.38,1616.38," So Ryan, this is going to be a rad transition."
1617.38,1622.38," Tell me you, you wanted to go on a rant because your games have been"
1622.38,1623.38, punishing you.
1623.38,1626.38," Well, it's sort of just like a very specific like many ran."
1626.38,1629.38," We need, we need theme music when we do the one Ryan's rant."
1629.38,1630.38, Ryan's rant.
1630.38,1631.38, Ryan's rant.
1631.38,1632.38, You really shot him.
1632.38,1633.38, He just dropped something in.
1633.38,1634.38, Okay.
1634.38,1635.38, Yeah.
1635.38,1636.38, Right.
1636.38,1637.38, Okay.
1637.38,1638.38, Ryan.
1638.38,1639.38, Okay.
1639.38,1640.38, He gets your letters.
1640.38,1641.38, Ryan's rant.
1641.38,1645.38, It needs to be the music from YouTube trolls video.
1645.38,1646.38, Yeah.
1646.38,1647.38, So I'm going to do the one.
1647.38,1649.38, You should have tried.
1649.38,1650.38, Try the life.
1650.38,1651.38, Ryan knows.
1651.38,1652.38, That reminds me.
1652.38,1654.38, We have to start that next week.
1654.38,1656.38," I want to do as like an alternative to, uh,"
1656.38,1658.38," here's the web, which we'll have one of today."
1658.38,1661.38, It kind of like a must view websites.
1661.38,1662.38, Okay.
1662.38,1663.38," Um, I don't have in this week."
1663.38,1664.38, We'll head them next week.
1664.38,1665.38, But that could be one.
1665.38,1666.38, I got it.
1666.38,1667.38, I don't have the URL for it.
1667.38,1668.38, Look.
1668.38,1669.38, Mark Files.
1669.38,1670.38, Yeah.
1670.38,1671.38, That's good stuff.
1671.38,1672.38, Make him make him family friendly though.
1673.38,1677.38, That's an object in terms of course your pull on.
1677.38,1678.38, Good power.
1678.38,1683.48, his
1684.38,1685.48, homework.
1685.48,1687.38, I'm sick here.
1687.38,1690.18," pipe email, and such Yeah."
1690.18,1693.38, I'd like to try the site.
1693.38,1695.38, Excellent Database.
1695.38,1696.38, Ernest.
1696.38,1698.2600000000002, I see both
1698.2600000000002,1699.2600000000002,iels.
1699.2600000000002,1701.2600000000002," Well, remember?"
1701.26,1705.26, I'm kind of late getting to that since it's been about a year since I came out.
1705.26,1710.26," But there's this item, the Final Fantasy 12."
1710.26,1712.26, I guess it's the most powerful weapon in the game.
1712.26,1714.26, It's called the Zodiac Spear.
1714.26,1716.26, But here in above is all for a game day.
1716.26,1717.26, Okay.
1717.26,1724.26," Well, so when I play in RPG, which is very rare for me because you know RPGs are very time consuming,"
1724.26,1725.26," and you know, I'm-"
1725.26,1726.26, It's all you're playing with.
1726.26,1728.26," But no, these are games."
1728.26,1730.26, It's very rare for me.
1730.26,1731.26, It's close to an MMMOzer.
1731.26,1733.26," Well, it's different."
1733.26,1736.26," Like, when I play, it's just like a single player RPG."
1736.26,1739.26," I'm the type of person who has to like obsessively find everything,"
1739.26,1740.26, explore every nook and cranny.
1740.26,1741.26, I do not stress-
1741.26,1742.26, I do not stress-
1742.26,1743.26, I do not stress-
1743.26,1748.26," Yeah, I do not rest until I've conquered the game, whatever you're going to find."
1748.26,1754.26," And, you know, most Final Fantasy games and you know, other RPGs, there's certain like pieces of content that, you know,"
1754.26,1757.26," if you don't get to them in time or you don't fulfill a certain condition,"
1757.26,1761.26," the content and question will be locked out to you, whatever."
1761.26,1763.26," You know, if you can chalk that up to just like,"
1763.26,1765.26," whooped you forgot to explore everywhere, you know, that's fair."
1765.26,1771.26," But this item in Final Fantasy 12, you get it toward the end game."
1771.26,1777.26," And, and at the very beginning of the game, they're these four specific chests,"
1777.26,1779.26," you know, there's like treasure chests all over the place that you open."
1779.26,1782.26," They're these four very specific chests in very specific locations,"
1782.26,1787.26," all very mundane, normal chests that if you open any of these four chests,"
1787.26,1790.26," you lose the ability to easily access this item,"
1790.26,1792.26, this is ODEX fear at the end of the game.
1792.26,1794.26," Like, how would you know that?"
1794.26,1795.26, There's no one.
1795.26,1796.26, There's no one in the case.
1796.26,1799.26," How it in the player know that even even like, you know,"
1799.26,1801.26," even if I go through the game, not caring about the stuff,"
1801.26,1804.26," and then go through a second time to carefully get everything,"
1804.26,1808.26, how would I even know that that's going to happen unless I was using a strategy guy?
1808.26,1810.26, When soccer Gucci son gives you lemon.
1810.26,1812.26," You're like, looming in."
1812.26,1814.26, I tell dude.
1814.26,1820.26," And maybe this is an example of Sean's like,"
1820.26,1821.26, rage knot syndrome.
1821.26,1824.26," But you said it doesn't make it impossible, though."
1824.26,1825.26, It's okay.
1825.26,1826.26, Okay.
1826.26,1828.26," When I say it, it doesn't make it impossible, though."
1828.26,1830.26," I guess there's another place you can get it,"
1830.26,1833.26," like a point one percent drop rate,"
1833.26,1836.26, which might as well be zero as far as I'm concerned.
1836.26,1839.26," So, so you're basically saying you open a chest."
1839.26,1843.26, Like you would like any anyone does in a game that trains you to do nothing
1843.26,1844.26, but open chest.
1844.26,1845.26, Right.
1845.26,1846.26, You try to get the best weapon.
1846.26,1847.26, But BAM!
1847.26,1848.26, Bitch!
1848.26,1849.26, You hate playing with the good weapon.
1849.26,1852.26," So it'd be like in Bioshok, you know, you loot corpses and stuff."
1852.26,1854.26," All of a sudden, a large frame."
1854.26,1856.26," It just hit E so fast, I'm like, I don't even try."
1856.26,1858.26," If I get drunk whatever, I just, I gotta go."
1858.26,1859.26, Yep.
1859.26,1862.26," I'm so, but then all of a sudden it was like,"
1862.26,1863.26, that you can no longer use electrical.
1863.26,1865.26," All you select, cigarette pack, the electroplasmids,"
1865.26,1868.26, because it's our material.
1868.26,1869.26, It's very random.
1869.26,1870.26, It's quite random.
1870.26,1872.26," It's like, it's like, it's like, it's stupid."
1872.26,1873.26, That is stupid.
1873.26,1874.26, That is stupid.
1874.26,1875.26, It's ridiculous.
1875.26,1876.26, I feel like I'm having the conversation.
1876.26,1877.26, That's why it's real because I had this conversation in your...
1877.26,1879.26," That's why it's a PS2 game, that a PC game."
1879.26,1880.26," So, how's it?"
1880.26,1882.26," Yeah, it's totally, it's totally just like,"
1882.26,1884.26, you need to go buy a strategy guy.
1884.26,1886.26, This is our transparent toy to make you go buy a strategy guy.
1886.26,1888.26," Like, how would anybody know that?"
1888.26,1890.26, How is that even like a logical...
1890.26,1891.26, It's not a...
1891.26,1892.26, It's ridiculous.
1892.26,1893.26, Way of thinking.
1893.26,1894.26, Yeah.
1894.26,1896.26," Well, okay, I know this is going to seem like a weird tangent,"
1896.26,1898.26, but hopefully there's some relation here.
1898.26,1900.26, But I've wondered in...
1900.26,1905.26," In World of Warcraft, actually, when there's these epic quest lines,"
1905.26,1908.26," there's Sean, you can address this."
1908.26,1914.26," And that there's chains where, you know, to do the highest level content,"
1914.26,1916.26, there will be a quest chain.
1916.26,1918.26," But in certain of these quest chains,"
1918.26,1921.26, the chain actually literally stops.
1921.26,1923.26," And it only progresses by like,"
1923.26,1926.26," talking to some specific NPC in some town or something,"
1926.26,1929.26," that doesn't have the question mark over it as head,"
1929.26,1932.26," where it's just like, oh, well, to get to the next part of the chain,"
1932.26,1934.26, you're going to have to talk to this dude over here.
1934.26,1935.26," And I want to know, like,"
1935.26,1938.26, how anybody ever knew to do that without a strategy guy?
1938.26,1941.26," Do they tell you the guy's name that you have to talk to,"
1941.26,1942.26, at least?
1942.26,1944.26," No, I don't know what you're referring to, specifically."
1944.26,1945.26, I can't remember.
1945.26,1948.26, I am referring to something along the...
1948.26,1949.26, Ah...
1949.26,1951.26, Ah...
1951.26,1952.26, What the...
1952.26,1954.26, Sorry.
1954.26,1956.26, Are you sure you're just too high level
1956.26,1957.26, that I have a question mark?
1957.26,1959.26, Because that happens sometimes.
1959.26,1960.26, If you out level the NPC...
1960.26,1961.26," No, I actually don't think so."
1961.26,1963.26," I think there's a place where,"
1963.26,1965.26," because I know on the guild, I'm sorry,"
1965.26,1967.26," I'm just totally biking, which question."
1967.26,1969.26," Okay, so we're talking about card rights."
1969.26,1970.26, But the way to...
1970.26,1972.26, But my point is that again...
1972.26,1973.26," Because other peck on the guild,"
1973.26,1975.26, we're complaining about the same thing.
1975.26,1978.26," So my point is, is in a way, sort of the same."
1978.26,1979.26," I'm just saying,"
1979.26,1982.26, this seems like something you had to know...
1982.26,1986.26, It wasn't readily available in the game as something that any gamer could get.
1986.26,1987.26, You had to have knowledge.
1987.26,1989.26," They either came from somebody who could warn you,"
1989.26,1991.26, I had a time or from a strategy guy.
1991.26,1993.26," That's how all games used to be flat out, though."
1993.26,1995.26," I mean, I'd be taking it way..."
1995.26,1996.26, Way back.
1996.26,1997.26," Castlevania, too."
1997.26,1998.26," The class, for example."
1998.26,1999.26," Oh, what?"
1999.26,2000.26, What the hell?
2000.26,2001.26, I'm really excited.
2001.26,2002.26, At the cliffside?
2002.26,2003.26, The cliffside?
2003.26,2004.26, Just games were like that.
2004.26,2005.26, You wouldn't even...
2005.26,2007.26," Not only would you not know, like, what you're supposed to do,"
2007.26,2009.26, but someone would happen and you wouldn't know what it was.
2009.26,2012.26, You would physically would not know what the how the object was.
2012.26,2013.26," I mean, that's just..."
2013.26,2014.26, That's just kind of like...
2014.26,2015.26, Like the legacy game was a basic thing.
2015.26,2016.26," Maybe something's okay, being a stuff, you know?"
2016.26,2018.26, That's back when people were smarter.
2018.26,2021.26," Yeah, so one of the happening now, you know?"
2021.26,2023.26," Well, it wasn't a case of..."
2023.26,2024.26," In this case, it didn't..."
2024.26,2027.26, It wasn't a requirement to continue to make progress.
2027.26,2030.26, The example Jeff is giving is...
2030.26,2033.26," But your example is just arbitrarily, like..."
2033.26,2034.26," Yes, right."
2034.26,2035.26," Yes, it's the same thing."
2036.26,2037.26," Well, that's my problem."
2037.26,2038.26, Your wob example...
2038.26,2039.26," There's no, like..."
2039.26,2040.26, Could you just give it to your last say?
2040.26,2042.26," You can never get this question, because you talked with a Bryant B.C."
2042.26,2043.26, It's still...
2043.26,2044.26," Yeah, it's got a figure out where he is."
2044.26,2047.26," Yeah, I'll have to come back and look at that."
2047.26,2048.26, Okay.
2048.26,2049.26, Warrior on this topic.
2049.26,2050.26, Lions thing is domino.
2050.26,2051.26," Yeah, your thing is domino."
2051.26,2052.26, My things are off...
2052.26,2053.26," No, awesome, but domino."
2053.26,2055.26, There are 53 replies to my blog post...
2055.26,2058.26, A Green Meal Mhostail on the line.
2058.26,2059.26, So...
2059.26,2061.26, A music-fuckish...
2061.26,2063.26, It don't-oh or a utility game.
2063.26,2066.1000000000004, that know that that 503 people got your back.
2066.1000000000004,2069.5, That's pretty much for a few double posts.
2069.5,2072.5, You guys should all get torches and march down the Squares Office.
2072.5,2073.5, That's 54 of you.
2073.5,2075.5, It's got a million nerd march right there.
2075.5,2079.78, That's pretty much win the internet.
2079.78,2083.2200000000003, On this year old debate.
2083.2200000000003,2087.9," This is just a reminder of the, I finally turned them off yesterday."
2087.9,2091.3," On the, yes, I'm playing the 360 by a shock for now."
2091.3,2094.7400000000002," I'm sorry that makes me the less of a PC gamer, but I am."
2094.7400000000002,2099.0600000000004, But I finally turned off the fucking Quest arrow.
2099.0600000000004,2102.5800000000004, I wish that just would die forever.
2102.5800000000004,2105.86," It was rather it's there because just like you were saying,"
2105.86,2108.42," you know, the point where you're like, oh, I'm supposed to go find this guy,"
2108.42,2110.02, but he's not marked as a Quest Giver.
2110.02,2110.54, Yeah.
2110.54,2113.7000000000003," When you hit your own personal version of that moment in Bioshoc,"
2113.7000000000003,2116.5, you turned to arrow on for all the seconds.
2116.5,2118.5800000000004, And then you turned it back there for as an option.
2118.5800000000004,2119.0600000000004, Yeah.
2119.0600000000004,2119.6200000000003, That's true.
2119.6200000000003,2120.1000000000004, Sorry.
2120.18,2123.7," The thing I agree, I generally don't like that sort of thing,"
2123.7,2127.7799999999997," but what's so awesome about, you know, Bioshoc is every step of the way"
2127.7799999999997,2130.74, it allows you to create the experience you want.
2130.74,2134.18," And if you want to just, if you don't want to play, you know,"
2134.18,2136.9, all you want to do is shoot and combo your powers and stuff.
2136.9,2140.18, You can turn that on and follow the path.
2140.18,2142.3399999999997," I don't, you know, I don't advocate that."
2142.3399999999997,2143.7799999999997," But I mean, it's there if you want to."
2143.7799999999997,2145.86," And no one's making you do it, you know, you can turn it off."
2145.86,2146.5, You can turn it off.
2146.5,2148.58," If you want to find every item, you know,"
2148.58,2151.2999999999997," you don't want to just run in because I always complain about how,"
2151.2999999999997,2154.98," for me, when you have a big flashing item with like an"
2154.98,2157.7," on screen, notice telling you to do something to it,"
2157.7,2161.46," then all I read it, I sort of like step outside of the game,"
2161.46,2162.66, the game world's own logic.
2162.66,2165.46," And instead of being, I don't know, flux pass,"
2165.46,2166.8199999999997," something, it's just there."
2166.8199999999997,2167.94, It's just the floating shit.
2167.94,2169.06, I go press E on.
2169.06,2170.1, So I can turn that off.
2170.1,2172.66," I mean, that's, but we talked about it last week, but I do."
2172.66,2177.14," I all around, I think it's just incredible that they've allowed you that much"
2177.14,2178.66, off freedom in the market.
2178.66,2179.54, It's like building it.
2179.54,2182.18, It's almost like building the hint guide in a sense.
2182.18,2184.8199999999997," I mean, like it's kind of a totally obsolete in that."
2184.8199999999997,2188.58," Other, not necessarily because there's not quite a level of like,"
2188.58,2192.58, please provide codes for safes and doors that require the past code.
2192.58,2193.54," I mean, it doesn't have that."
2193.54,2193.7, Right.
2193.7,2195.54, I'm not telling you all the audio diaries are hidden.
2195.54,2195.8599999999997, Right.
2195.8599999999997,2197.14," But it's enough to give you like, it's like,"
2197.14,2198.74," it reminds me, like, we've talked about this before,"
2198.74,2200.66," but it reminds me of those old Sierra handflokes,"
2200.66,2203.7799999999997," with the highlighter, like you only like reveal what you need to know."
2203.7799999999997,2205.8599999999997," And then just kind of like, you figure out the rest on your own,"
2205.86,2207.3, which is perfect for me.
2207.3,2209.2200000000003," But if like, like, the situation you're talking about,"
2209.2200000000003,2211.06," Sean, we're like, you can't, like, okay,"
2211.06,2213.1400000000003, I make a left here or right what's going on.
2213.1400000000003,2216.02, And the arrow points you there and you can just turn it off afterwards.
2216.02,2216.98, That's all I want.
2216.98,2220.82, It's it's options like that that I've constantly surprised that
2220.82,2222.82, more game don't let you do all that stuff.
2222.82,2226.26," I'm just like, how could you not want me to be able to, you know,"
2226.26,2227.86, something just don't let you switch to people.
2227.86,2229.06, All of the stuff.
2229.06,2229.86," Well, there you go."
2229.86,2231.86, There are already experienced.
2231.86,2232.6600000000003, Yeah.
2232.6600000000003,2234.1800000000003," But like, you want to game that doesn't let you"
2234.2599999999998,2235.22, metal with the controls.
2235.22,2236.74, This is more console than PCL.
2236.74,2239.7799999999997," It's like, how could you not let me do that?"
2239.7799999999997,2241.7799999999997, It's just obnoxious.
2241.7799999999997,2244.02," At this point, there's just no excuse."
2244.02,2246.02," I mean, especially on the PC."
2246.02,2247.54, Yeah.
2247.54,2249.8599999999997, Since we're going to be doing a lot of bowshot talking.
2249.8599999999997,2250.8999999999996, It's a little bit too loud.
2250.8999999999996,2251.94," Yeah, you want to take a vote."
2251.94,2255.06," You want to talk about two worlds, or do you want to talk about an"
2255.06,2255.8599999999997, on-air vote?
2255.8599999999997,2256.74, Medal of Honor.
2256.74,2258.2599999999998, Do you want to take an air-born?
2258.2599999999998,2259.54," Well, we'll take a break."
2259.54,2260.4199999999996, Not G.
2260.4199999999996,2261.06, Let's vote first.
2261.06,2261.94, That's taken the break.
2261.94,2262.74," Okay, vote first."
2262.8199999999997,2263.62, All those.
2265.14,2266.8199999999997," Well, I'm the only guy who played two worlds."
2266.8199999999997,2268.8199999999997," So I'm going to say, let's hold off until next week."
2268.8199999999997,2270.18, If anyone else is going to try it.
2271.4599999999996,2272.18, I want to try it.
2272.18,2272.8199999999997, I'm going to try it.
2272.8199999999997,2273.9399999999996, They didn't send me a copy.
2275.4599999999996,2277.06," Well, they said, yeah, let's take a break."
2277.06,2277.54, Let's take a break.
2277.54,2278.8999999999996, I can break it down.
2278.8999999999996,2280.18," Okay, we're going to take a break."
2280.18,2282.3399999999997," When we come back from the break, we'll have made our decision."
2284.02,2287.8599999999997, And then we'll discuss that decision.
2289.06,2290.3399999999997," Yeah, and other things."
2290.3399999999997,2290.8199999999997, Take a good.
2290.8199999999997,2291.14, Yeah.
2292.74,2294.02, I was going to start with a full-length joke.
2294.02,2295.62, And then I got my star from Nunchokes.
2295.62,2296.3399999999997, Dolls him.
2296.3399999999997,2297.06, But it is.
2297.06,2298.5," She's a Bruce Lee, but it will be right back."
2301.14,2303.7799999999997," Three, two, one, you're the best."
2303.7799999999997,2304.5, All right.
2306.8999999999996,2311.06," Listen to EGM Live, the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly,"
2311.06,2316.3399999999997, available every Monday for download at EGMlive.1up.com or podcast.
2316.3399999999997,2318.9799999999996, That one up.com or the iTunes music store.
2323.7,2324.5, We're back.
2324.5,2327.2999999999997," And we're not going to talk about either of the things we said we were,"
2327.2999999999997,2329.14, because we're just radical that way.
2330.3399999999997,2332.02," I'm going to start with going to talk about Guild Wars,"
2332.02,2335.14," because Ryan's been playing the next expansion pack,"
2335.14,2338.18, either north or is it eyes?
2338.18,2338.74, Eye.
2338.74,2339.7799999999997, The singular eye.
2339.7799999999997,2340.58, Yeah.
2340.58,2341.7799999999997, And how is it?
2341.7799999999997,2342.74, It's a squinty eye.
2342.74,2346.02," Well, um, what little I've gotten to play?"
2346.02,2349.54," I mean, they just had like kind of a sneak peek weekend for people who"
2349.62,2353.7," pre-order the game, which, you know, it then locked a very limited amount of content."
2355.3,2357.7, Just over the weekend for players.
2359.7,2362.9," And it's, I mean, a lot of it's kind of more the same."
2362.9,2364.66," You know, I mean, it's kind of what you expect."
2365.86,2366.98, In an MMO.
2366.98,2367.94," Oh, yeah."
2367.94,2370.02, So you get quests.
2370.02,2370.9, You get quests.
2370.9,2371.7, Hill stuff.
2371.7,2372.82, And then you get loot.
2372.82,2373.46, You do.
2373.46,2373.86, Yeah.
2373.86,2375.22, And that's awesome.
2375.22,2379.22, The big difference with this is that it has no content designed for
2379.2999999999997,2380.1, new players.
2380.1,2382.66, You have to have a character who has gone through.
2383.8599999999997,2386.8999999999996," Well, you have to have a character who is at least a little 20 and I believe you have to"
2386.8999999999996,2389.8599999999997, have finished one of the three existing Guild Wars campaigns.
2390.74,2397.7," And uh, and I have the north is this is this new region in the map, the area in the original"
2397.7,2404.3399999999997," Guild Wars, which is the continent is called Tira and it shares like that map for those of you"
2404.3399999999997,2405.8599999999997, who have the original Guild Wars.
2406.7400000000002,2412.1800000000003," And uh, so this I mean, but that's very standard expansion pack stuff, right?"
2412.1800000000003,2414.6600000000003, Just high level content for existing players.
2414.6600000000003,2415.06, Yeah.
2415.06,2417.94," That's, that's, this is the first time Guild Wars has done it."
2417.94,2421.38," I mean, each of the other expansions, you know, factions and nightfall."
2422.58,2428.1, They were complete campaigners that you could play from level one to 20 without owning any previous
2428.1,2429.06, Guild Wars product.
2429.06,2432.1800000000003, So this is the first one for experience players only.
2432.7400000000002,2434.34," Since you, you've played all of them."
2434.5,2438.34, I've been wondering this since I'm playing Nightfall now and I'm up to level 10 and this is the
2438.34,2439.78, first one that I've gotten into.
2442.1800000000003,2447.46," Where the where the factions and Nightfall, if you already had a level 20 character from the first"
2447.46,2451.38," one, is it something you would want to take that same character through these new campaigns?"
2451.38,2452.1800000000003, Absolutely.
2452.1800000000003,2452.82, Yes.
2452.82,2453.1400000000003, Yeah.
2453.1400000000003,2456.26," I mean, my, my main character, he's a Ranger from factions."
2457.46,2457.78, Mm-hmm.
2457.78,2462.82," And I mean, there's nothing keeping you from going through the easy to be doing campaigns."
2462.9,2465.2200000000003, It was starting with people playing at level one.
2465.2200000000003,2470.5800000000004," No, well, I mean, I mean, the beginning content in any campaign is going to be, you know, a"
2470.5800000000004,2475.6200000000003," cakewalk for a level 20 character, but most of the content in each campaign is balanced for"
2476.5,2477.78, level 20 characters.
2477.78,2481.1400000000003," So, you know, you're going to get a full game how to be to those."
2481.1400000000003,2484.42, Yes. So what can folks expect from I of the north?
2484.98,2490.42," Well, um, not very many new skills this time around."
2490.5,2499.62," Usually each of the, each of the new campaigns has a, uh, I want to say, uh, 50 or 60 new skills per"
2499.62,2500.1800000000003, class.
2501.06,2502.26, Seems like a lot.
2502.26,2503.3," It, it is a lot."
2504.66,2508.1800000000003," Um, but this one has only 10 skills per class, which is,"
2509.2200000000003,2512.5, is that including those like dungeon only ones that they were talking about?
2512.5,2518.58," Well, there, there's a set of, uh, pv-e only skills that, uh, so far as I can tell they are"
2518.66,2519.94, given out as Quest rewards.
2521.14,2525.14, I don't really count those quite as much though since those aren't like universally
2525.14,2527.22," useful, like in pvp and stuff. Right."
2527.94,2530.34," But um, you can see Sean L. A."
2530.34,2531.38, Fading away over there.
2531.38,2533.94," Wait, yeah, we're done."
2533.94,2538.74," That I'm, I mean, like over the course of the weekend, like, you know, I already unlocked all my, my"
2538.74,2539.2999999999997, Rangers.
2540.2599999999998,2542.42, Damn already in the sneak preview weekend.
2542.42,2544.8199999999997," I mean, you just like, you just buy him from the vendor."
2544.8199999999997,2546.18," So, wait, maybe they're just,"
2547.14,2548.8999999999996, didn't have all the skills in this make peek.
2548.8999999999996,2553.2999999999997," Are, are you sure that I'm sure they're only 10 per profession?"
2553.2999999999997,2559.14," Are these like crazy skills that like just are like, look awesome and, um, there's, there are a couple"
2559.14,2564.66," really good ones, at least that I noticed. Um, there's this old Ranger Elite scale,"
2564.66,2568.18," Elite, meaning you can only take one Elite scale with you at any given time."
2568.18,2568.66, Okay.
2568.66,2574.8199999999997," There's this Elite Ranger scale from the original game called Barrage, which, uh, for a lot of people,"
2574.9,2580.34," a lot of people, um, pointed that as the, um, kind of new Ranger Elite scale."
2580.34,2581.3, Okay.
2581.3,2586.7400000000002," For, for babies. But so, what Barrage does basically, you know, you can hit six enemies at once,"
2586.7400000000002,2588.02," which is, which is pretty awesome."
2588.02,2588.9, Mm-hmm.
2588.9,2590.1800000000003, And there's a new scale.
2591.78,2594.02," I, I forget what it's called."
2594.02,2598.5," It's a rapid fire, maybe, and thinking of the wrong name, but it's, it's basically a,"
2598.5,2601.94, a non elite version of Barrage that does a little bit less damage.
2602.82,2604.58," You know, we hit three people in that six."
2605.7000000000003,2606.9, So that's pretty awesome.
2606.9,2607.7000000000003, That's a great.
2607.7000000000003,2608.9, I can tell you guys agree.
2611.3,2612.58, You're actually guys in the middle of that.
2612.58,2613.46," So far, yeah."
2613.46,2614.7400000000002," I mean, Elliot's excited."
2614.7400000000002,2615.62," I just, it's funny."
2615.62,2619.38," It's like, I said that Guild Wars is the first, like true, well, it's not even true,"
2619.38,2623.06," I'm in no, but next to like fans, you're still online at MMO type game,"
2623.06,2626.82," that I played for a while, but I just hit a wall on all of them after a while."
2626.82,2630.5," I just, they just don't sustain my interest after, you know, maybe two weeks of play,"
2630.66,2631.86, two or three weeks of play.
2631.86,2635.22," So now it's just the fact that it's on, you know, the third expansion."
2635.22,2639.38," And it's like, I got bored before the first one came out."
2639.38,2641.78," Did you, when you were playing, when you were playing Guild Wars,"
2641.78,2643.78, like what level did you get to like level 20 in the first?
2643.78,2647.3," Yeah, I got to level 20 in an, I didn't finish it, but I, you know, the,"
2647.3,2649.62," ascension is a big, you know, element of the narrative in it."
2649.62,2651.3, And I did that and it was cool.
2651.3,2653.62," But then it was like, no, I just wanted something else,"
2653.62,2654.58, wanted another experience.
2654.58,2656.74, So I messed with the auto assault was fun.
2656.74,2658.18, Then hit a point with that.
2658.18,2660.1," And then we'll see how long I play Tagula, also."
2660.18,2661.7799999999997," It's really, you know, things around the level 20."
2661.7799999999997,2662.98," I mean, we're 25 or so."
2662.98,2665.94," I think when it's that people hit that grind point in most games,"
2665.94,2666.9," it around then, right?"
2667.94,2672.42," Yeah, I mean, it's a very scary game, but yeah, but what a level means is totally different."
2672.42,2672.9, Right.
2672.9,2676.9," Certainly after a certain amount of hours, you know, when the novelty is worn off,"
2676.9,2682.3399999999997," the, the level, you know, hitting the next levels, it gets to be progressively harder."
2683.22,2686.42," You either like, made friends in the game or not, you know,"
2686.42,2688.42," yeah, and that's the, I mean, I had friends in the game,"
2688.42,2689.7000000000003," but it was just, it was just that."
2689.7000000000003,2691.38, It just gets progressively more difficult.
2691.38,2694.42," And yeah, that's how I probably got to get the list out of it."
2694.42,2697.06," I understood the game, understood the mechanics of it."
2697.06,2701.38," And, you know, it's like, it's also the distance between like the big carrots."
2701.38,2704.9," Like, yeah, you know, if like at level 40 and while there's like the mountain,"
2704.9,2706.82, that's like this thing you got to get right now.
2706.82,2708.42," And then when you get that, yeah,"
2708.42,2709.78, something that's where a lot of people drop off.
2709.78,2710.34, That's right.
2710.34,2712.66," Big desert of like, oh my god, not what."
2712.66,2714.42," Yeah, like 42 or so."
2714.42,2718.02," So when people really start losing it in a while, because there's nothing."
2718.1,2721.78," Until 60, like you've spent all your time trying to get the mountain out."
2721.78,2723.78," It's like, oh, and I'm a little afraid of."
2723.78,2724.66, I'm facing a void.
2725.38,2728.66, I'm having trouble in guild wars for some of those reasons.
2728.66,2735.54," I mean, I, first of all, I find some of the game mechanics confusing."
2735.54,2739.38, And there's not nearly as much information given.
2739.38,2742.42," Like I know one of the, I ran to you about this."
2742.42,2746.42," We were talking about, yeah, like the, the fact that you have to buy skills."
2746.5,2749.14," Yeah, and the game doesn't explain that to you."
2749.14,2751.06," You know, I mean, there's certain basic mechanics."
2751.06,2754.9," I was like, wow, I sure wish I knew that for levels ago,"
2754.9,2757.86," when I could have actually bought some skills, that kind of thing."
2757.86,2758.66, And it's like the kind of thing.
2758.66,2759.62, I don't even think about it.
2759.62,2761.06," It's basically, it's a good point."
2761.06,2764.02," Earlier today, though, I just revealed the Jeff that the Electrobolt"
2764.02,2766.34, would stun machinery in Bioshack.
2766.34,2767.06, I don't really like all.
2767.06,2767.94, No one told me that.
2767.94,2770.9," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not it at all."
2770.9,2771.62, I knew it could.
2771.62,2773.14, The problem was I couldn't swap it out.
2773.14,2773.94, Yeah.
2773.94,2776.1800000000003," I, I did what I didn't know was if I took out"
2776.18,2779.06," Electrobolt early on, I wouldn't be able to put it back"
2779.06,2781.7, and to on another slot opened up.
2781.7,2782.66," So, you're editing it."
2782.66,2783.54, You found the engine.
2783.54,2784.5," Engine, the engine bank."
2784.5,2786.4199999999996," Right, because I didn't hit the first gen bank yet,"
2786.4199999999996,2788.98, but I already have a big daddy to kill an Electro-Shock
2788.98,2789.94, is gone.
2789.94,2790.66," Oh, I'm sitting."
2790.66,2791.2999999999997, Do you know a game?
2791.2999999999997,2792.5, Don't kill them just wait.
2792.5,2793.3799999999997, You'll still be there.
2793.3799999999997,2793.94," Yeah, we'll see."
2793.94,2795.54, I'm going to wear a bus call.
2795.54,2796.1, Yeah.
2796.1,2799.2999999999997," And the other thing about God Wars is the community, I find it."
2799.2999999999997,2801.94, Maybe it's just because I don't have my little buddies yet.
2801.94,2804.4199999999996, But I don't have any little buddies yet.
2804.42,2807.38," So I, I find it harder to make friends in that game."
2808.02,2810.34, Just tell them who you are and you'll find your friends.
2810.34,2811.54, You'll find playing a friends.
2811.54,2812.1, Yeah.
2812.1,2813.2200000000003, And Jeff Green.
2813.2200000000003,2813.94, Go in there.
2813.94,2814.42, Yeah.
2814.42,2815.62, You know who fuck I am?
2815.62,2817.06," I, uh, I know what."
2819.06,2820.7400000000002, Now watch tonight there's a bunch of names Jeff Green.
2820.7400000000002,2822.98, You'd be lucky to have me in your guild.
2822.98,2826.26," Now, so I joined the first guild where someone just ran by and said,"
2826.26,2828.02," you want to be in a guild, it's like, yeah, sure."
2828.66,2829.94," And then, of course, they were completely,"
2829.94,2830.5, with your names.
2830.5,2831.86," What's your name in the game, your character name?"
2832.7400000000002,2833.78," Knowing that if you say,"
2833.86,2835.38, now you do a bunch of friendly bites.
2836.34,2839.7000000000003," Oh, it might help explain why I'm not, I don't have that many friends yet."
2840.9,2841.7000000000003, What I have to say it.
2841.7000000000003,2843.0600000000004, You don't have to use your card.
2843.0600000000004,2843.86, It's all lies.
2843.86,2845.46, Don't bitch about not having friends though.
2845.46,2847.7000000000003," If you want to name it, I'm a retard."
2849.3,2850.1000000000004, Is it?
2850.1000000000004,2850.9, Yeah.
2850.9,2854.02," The, let's, I thought, re-tard with an age in the middle."
2855.38,2855.7000000000003, Okay.
2856.34,2857.7000000000003," We're, we're, we're hard."
2857.7000000000003,2858.9," Well, yeah."
2858.9,2861.2200000000003," See, now you totally deflated my argument."
2862.18,2863.3799999999997, You do it to yourself.
2863.3799999999997,2864.58, I don't have any friends.
2865.7799999999997,2866.8199999999997, Why do I?
2866.8199999999997,2867.8599999999997," Hey, you know what?"
2867.8599999999997,2869.22, So this is a move on it.
2869.22,2871.4599999999996, That's pretty tame compared to some of the names that I came in.
2871.4599999999996,2871.8599999999997, Yeah.
2871.8599999999997,2876.5," But I did join a guild and then the guild talk immediately was like,"
2876.5,2879.62," the lamest, you know, I had, I just quit, like,"
2879.62,2881.8599999999997," I can't believe at this point in your Emma Moquer,"
2881.8599999999997,2884.4199999999996, you would randomly just join a guild because someone asked.
2885.22,2886.8999999999996," I know, that's how that was."
2886.8999999999996,2888.66, To be liked and accepted.
2888.66,2889.2999999999997," Oh, hang out with me."
2889.2999999999997,2890.4199999999996," Turn my guild, all right?"
2890.4199999999996,2890.8199999999997, Yeah.
2890.82,2894.34," Now that we're deep in the mode and we're talking about, well,"
2894.34,2896.34," not retards, but now that we're talking about."
2897.3,2901.2200000000003," Yeah, so it's very, it's very, it's very, it's just go to move on to hero the web."
2902.42,2904.82," All right, we please save us with the heroes of the web."
2904.82,2906.26," So this is a rough, rough, rough, rough."
2906.26,2909.06," Uh, the, the, the, the, comes from muddy junk."
2909.06,2910.1800000000003, That's his buddy.
2910.1800000000003,2910.82, Yeah.
2910.82,2911.78, Buddy junk.
2911.78,2912.6600000000003, We can group up with him.
2912.6600000000003,2915.94," And he, uh, I'm muddy me to a thread on the official"
2915.94,2917.06, Mass Effect forms.
2917.06,2918.6600000000003," Uh, the topic being,"
2919.62,2921.8599999999997, what he calls blue alien poong tang.
2923.06,2926.02," And he says it's a nice, uh, mix of incoherent and panetic."
2926.66,2930.8199999999997," So starting it off, user Vly 574."
2930.8199999999997,2934.02," And mind you, this is the, for a game that hasn't been released yet."
2934.66,2936.18, Fiction for it already exists.
2936.18,2937.7," They official fiction, the not my,"
2937.7,2939.2999999999997, Perfect novel has been released.
2940.2599999999998,2941.2999999999997, So Vly.
2943.94,2948.5," For those of you saying, you cannot have sex with her."
2948.5,2953.54," As wrong in the bucket clearly states that the Asaria,"
2953.54,2955.54, very skilled lovers.
2955.54,2957.3," In other words, create and bad."
2959.06,2962.58," They not fall in love or be attracted to males,"
2962.58,2966.18, but that doesn't mean they don't enjoy having sex.
2966.18,2967.86, Like everyone else.
2967.86,2970.42, I assume they have all the correct tools.
2971.22,2976.02," As they press, and they would be all that creating bed at the head."
2976.1,2977.38, No.
2977.38,2978.74," Well, you know."
2982.02,2983.54, Winds and rings response.
2984.74,2990.2599999999998," Okay, your shoemates are human and therefore respond positively to touch."
2990.2599999999998,2992.74, Whether it is from a human or another animal.
2992.74,2995.62," Second, yes, petting is pleasurable for animals,"
2995.62,2997.3, but not necessarily sexual.
2998.34,2999.46, Let's put it this way.
3000.18,3004.02, Say there's an alien species out there who get really turned on by
3004.1,3005.86, elder robes with their mate.
3005.86,3007.3, That's their idea of foreplay.
3008.02,3012.18, As Virginia testosterone comes shooting out of their brain by the truck
3012.18,3013.06, blood.
3013.06,3016.2599999999998," Well, the food of those aliens came up to human and started robbing"
3016.2599999999998,3016.9, others.
3016.9,3021.38, The human may logically and intellectually know what's going on.
3021.38,3023.14," But since it's not a turn on for us,"
3023.14,3025.38, none of those pleasure hormones are love hormones.
3026.02,3028.18, Our brain without respond is some of these
3028.18,3031.3, teeth and teeth in compatible foreplay.
3031.86,3035.6200000000003," Which is the reasoning behind some of the arguments with me,"
3035.6200000000003,3036.5, sorry.
3036.5,3040.02," If they're not sexual, it are not wired to be sexual."
3040.02,3043.54," They may not respond sexually, are you chemically tax?"
3043.54,3048.42, Even though they may be technically biologically able to carry such acts out.
3048.42,3051.6200000000003, A human is physically capable of robbing others.
3051.6200000000003,3054.7400000000002," But it's never going to make the human desire sex,"
3054.7400000000002,3056.02, but I have sexual release.
3058.02,3060.6600000000003," Oh my god, that is the comedy."
3061.3,3062.6600000000003, What is this a reference to?
3062.6600000000003,3064.6600000000003, You got a bottle of some aliens in the abbey.
3064.6600000000003,3067.38," If it's not, a future science fiction office."
3067.38,3070.26," I say to that is, you're some cookie midgets,"
3070.26,3073.2200000000003, pull the fingers out your ass and sniff the douki digits.
3074.26,3075.2200000000003, I've seen that website.
3077.6200000000003,3079.6200000000003, Why are people having conversations like that?
3080.9,3084.1000000000004," But it's all like, and those were just like a few samples."
3084.1000000000004,3086.6600000000003, I really could write it for hours and hours because
3087.78,3090.5, an enormous thread that just goes on and on.
3090.58,3093.94," And it's not just two people going, it's not just those two buffoons going back and forth,"
3093.94,3097.46," but I mean, it's like ever seemingly everyone in the community sounding off."
3097.46,3100.02," Because I mean, it's clearly important that you establish"
3100.74,3102.1, if you can have sexual.
3102.1,3103.46," Like, why is it a question?"
3103.46,3105.7," Anyways, you're not going to fuck the assari in,"
3105.7,3107.54, if that's a fact that it comes out.
3107.54,3110.5, I think I hear assumed that they had the proper tools.
3110.9,3111.46, They're stunned.
3111.46,3111.94, Why?
3111.94,3113.62," Oh, yeah, we're fucking fictional."
3113.62,3114.74, They don't exist.
3114.74,3116.58, He walked under one and counted the holes.
3120.58,3121.62," Let's go on there, man."
3121.62,3122.1, Yeah.
3122.82,3126.82," So, hey, how do we, how do we go from there?"
3126.82,3127.46, I don't know.
3127.46,3129.46, I don't want to kill myself after that.
3129.46,3130.66," All right, let's just go and see."
3130.66,3130.98, Wow.
3130.98,3131.86," So, we don't have much time left."
3131.86,3134.5," We're going to Medal of Honor, Erboron, then real quick,"
3134.5,3137.94," the demo for PC is out this week and, yes, sir."
3137.94,3140.42, Some people seem to like it quite a bit.
3140.42,3140.82, Yeah.
3140.82,3142.58, The demo is taken from the first level in the game.
3143.3,3145.94," And the rest of the game, I'd say,"
3146.58,3149.7," as Medal of Honor goes, it's actually, it's pretty good."
3149.7799999999997,3151.06, It's a pretty good Medal of Honor game.
3152.4199999999996,3153.8599999999997," You're playing this for a review, correct?"
3153.8599999999997,3154.74," For review, yeah."
3154.74,3157.3799999999997," And, you know, I've gone through a couple of times now."
3158.4199999999996,3160.8199999999997, The thing is with that everything that they promising all their
3160.8199999999997,3163.54," boat points that you can, you know, you add drop into the action,"
3163.54,3166.3399999999997," you land where you want, and then from there you fight in, you know,"
3166.3399999999997,3167.54, whatever battle you choose.
3168.5,3170.8199999999997, They deliver just that and it works really well.
3170.8199999999997,3174.8199999999997," The verticality of the levels is definitely paying off, you know, so,"
3174.8199999999997,3176.8999999999996," by which, I mean, you know, you land on a roof somewhere,"
3177.54,3180.34," and you have the advantage of height on a certain group,"
3180.34,3181.7000000000003, then you can go down somewhere else.
3182.34,3187.7000000000003," And it's definitely finding that you, I don't know."
3187.7000000000003,3190.1800000000003," I mean, in the way that I like the later levels of call duty, too,"
3190.1800000000003,3193.54," that gave you the option, say, hey, you have these three objectives,"
3193.54,3195.94, you're going to do them in whatever order you want.
3195.94,3199.86," It just gets, it makes it more replayable to find part of what makes it work,"
3199.86,3204.34," is that the AI is super, the AI's got some definite issues, but what it does."
3204.34,3207.54," So first off, you know, to praise it, it's really mobile."
3207.54,3211.06," So they relocate a lot. I mean, if they, it's not just a matter of,"
3211.94,3215.7000000000003, they go behind a single crate and will continue to pop up and down until you finally kill them.
3215.7000000000003,3221.38," They will do that in periods, but then just as often, they will run away and, you know,"
3221.38,3224.9," take cover somewhere else or, I don't know if it's like they're trying to flank."
3224.9,3227.54," You have the time it just seems haphazard. It just seems like they're moving,"
3227.54,3229.38, but the fact that they are moving makes it fun.
3230.9,3234.1000000000004," But they have this annoying thing, especially when I've seen people calling it,"
3234.5,3240.98," it's a zombie talians because in the first level is an operation husking, so you're fighting"
3240.98,3244.98," us, some Italian black shirts, and they just want to rush you and melee the hell out of you."
3244.98,3250.2599999999998," And I can get annoying because, I mean, you drop into the place that's more difficult than you"
3250.2599999999998,3254.58," should. It gives you the option of dropping into a safe zone marked by green smoke and where you have,"
3254.58,3258.2599999999998," you can resupply with health and ammunition and stuff. But if you go into a difficult area,"
3258.2599999999998,3262.3399999999997, they all just like fucking bum rush you and they're all just whipping you.
3262.42,3268.34, And it's giving you this motion blur effect. There's all around you beat me and that's pretty annoying.
3271.1400000000003,3276.58," So that's that's stuff fun. It gets over, overblown, but my, my problems with the game,"
3276.58,3280.9," and I've seen this repeated elsewhere too, is for some weird reason, the people that make"
3280.9,3286.1000000000004, Medal of Honor have decided that they have found their own sweet spot for the amount of damage
3286.1000000000004,3292.26," that any of their NPCs should take before dying. And it's far too much, I think, especially after"
3292.26,3298.5800000000004," games that call of duty of proven, if you take a rifle with a card 98 or a garond, these are basically"
3298.5800000000004,3304.42," well, the cards of both action. You take a weapon, even a submachine gun, a single burst will"
3304.42,3308.82," down an enemy. And here's why it pays off because in a shooter, when you look around, you scan your"
3308.82,3313.3," environment, you see a lot of movement. And in the same way that tests, you know, the psychology"
3313.3,3319.38," is due and neuroscientists show, hey, that hardcore gamers are like very good at sort of,"
3319.46,3322.6600000000003," you know, you show them a screen. You know, you're taking a good home test. This is a good way to"
3322.6600000000003,3327.06," get ready. They've never explicitly done it, but same thing. It's like how many red dots appeared on the"
3327.06,3332.34, screen? Yeah. And the gamers are great at that. And especially people that play shooters and stuff. So what
3332.34,3337.3," happens is you do that. You count the dots on the clock, home screen, but then you immediately go"
3337.3,3341.78," boom, work the bolt, shoot this guy, work the bolt, shoot this guy, or some machine a burst or whatever."
3341.78,3346.82," And after you've counted the threats, you've also prioritized them and you decide, okay, I'm going"
3346.82,3352.6600000000003," to dispatch them in this order. But the problem is you do that same, you know, line of processing"
3353.3,3358.5," in metal of honor, but instead of them just going down, you hit them square in the chest with like,"
3358.5,3364.5," you know, a very big round. And then they go down, but they're really, they're not in a wounded"
3364.5,3368.82," animation or limping or showing that they've been hit, they're just going back into cover. And they"
3368.82,3373.7000000000003," pop that, back up again, you hit them again. And it's like, okay, can I go to the next target?"
3373.7,3377.2999999999997," And then you do and you look back and you're like, there's Brio again. And he's coming back up"
3377.2999999999997,3383.3799999999997," for more. So you got to like, you reload again and blast him in the face one more time. And what happens is"
3383.9399999999996,3388.74," or even if he's running across the street and you're just like, I'm loading, you know, just keep going."
3388.74,3393.22," You're like, okay, count the bolts down there. 32, that's it, time to reload. Dude, still running into"
3393.22,3400.2599999999998," a house. It eventually gets pretty annoying. And realism isn't, you know, realism isn't a thing"
3400.34,3406.7400000000002," because I've talked before about how you take a shooter in, um, like, I don't know what is it"
3406.7400000000002,3411.2200000000003," asked front, right, orchestra, and you go for more realism in that scenario. And that's not funny."
3411.2200000000003,3416.6600000000003," There because of things you move slow, you get wounded. I mean, like in armed assault, you get shot"
3416.6600000000003,3420.26," in the leg and you basically spend the rest of the level crawling. Yeah, that's stupid too. So"
3420.26,3424.34," so that's not the case. And it's not a realistic game. But at the same time, just for purely"
3424.34,3428.98," rewarding the experience of it. I mean, they need to do that. And it causes this series promise"
3429.7,3433.62," but definitely, you know, I mean, what just to interrupt for a sec, I mean, some of what you're"
3433.62,3438.7400000000002," you're talking about. I mean, in addition to the comparison with shooters like Red Orchestra,"
3438.7400000000002,3447.7," they're certainly other shooters, you know, in a non-realistic setting where enemies can be a total"
3447.7,3452.5," bitch to kill, right? I mean, don't you think that that is playing part of it here that it is a realist"
3452.5,3456.82, that it's a world war two thing that these guys aren't going down when they're getting a machine gun
3456.82,3461.38," fellow led to the face. I think it, yeah, I guess it is because you're, it's part of it's"
3461.38,3467.3," your expectations. We have certain, whenever you defeat a player's expectations of something,"
3467.3,3471.06, then they're going to be fighting whatever fiction you're creating. And so that could be some of it.
3471.06,3476.02," I mean, I think it was a big joke. It's exploding flaming eye coming at you. Then you might not be going"
3476.02,3479.94," little. Oh, why isn't this guy going down? But it still would get going. Say if every single zombie"
3479.94,3485.86," and doom three required about, you know, eight shotgun blasts or whatever, then I think you would still"
3485.94,3490.42," run into the same problem. But I think, yeah, you do have a point there and that you expect something"
3490.42,3495.78," because you know the setting and you're like, okay, that's ridiculous. And they really do push it."
3495.78,3499.54," Here's something I know the comment I make, you know, I want to make about the series is that"
3499.54,3504.58," they continually market is like, this is real war and they always try to outdo one another. You know,"
3504.58,3511.3," they have various kernels and sergeants and everything that they bring to their, they say,"
3511.3,3516.42," they're both so funny. They do. That they bring to, you know, that still press demos and stuff like that."
3516.42,3520.82," We got a general and they talk about, yeah, and then they even talk about like what were our military"
3520.82,3526.1000000000004," uh, liaison outranks, the one that the other series uses. I've actually heard that, you know,"
3526.1000000000004,3531.46, to be in Melar called Dede and Brothers and Arms. And so they try to present this case. And then
3531.46,3536.9," the other thing is that, you know, they say everything in this game is based on on realism, the way that"
3536.9,3540.6600000000003," you upgrade your weapons. You know, soldiers really modify their weapons in the field. But"
3541.54,3545.54," no, I don't know that any soldiers getting five headshots and all of a sudden like a better"
3545.54,3550.1800000000003, bolt appearing inside their gun in a flash and a flurry of bolt time that allowed them to jack five
3550.1800000000003,3556.82," more dudes. So they're taking you. But metal of honors, the one to me that's the most like"
3556.82,3561.78," it's part of an older tradition of sergeant rock, Nick Fury, you know, sergeant fury in the"
3561.78,3567.7000000000003," Holland Commandos, Captain America, all comic book movies, but also John Wayne movies and stuff the"
3567.7799999999997,3574.18," way that, you know, World War II was treated for a very long time. And ironically, it was saving"
3574.18,3580.66," private Ryan and with it banned a brother for HBL, but I mean, how am I, I'm Spielberg, who also"
3580.66,3585.8599999999997," kickstarted the Medal of Honor series that sort of changed the environment and said, okay,"
3585.8599999999997,3590.1," now we can expect different things. You know, while neither the, well, there's, you know, any any kind"
3590.1,3595.62," of a bolt counter can say that there's problems in those movies too, they can say, well, why the hell"
3595.7,3599.7799999999997," was it a Mustang that did the strafing around on the tank instead of a P47 Thunderbolt, that's"
3599.7799999999997,3606.3399999999997," bullshit. They can do all this kind of stuff like that. They were compared to John Wayne,"
3606.3399999999997,3611.54," San's Vue Schumer, whoever is like, okay, it's definitely a step up. But Medal of Honor, despite"
3611.54,3615.8599999999997," that, Medal of Honor has been the one that it's the series that's got the health packs that you run over,"
3616.42,3622.58," you know, it's the one now that turns everything about itself into a mini game. So like I was saying,"
3622.66,3627.46," you get a certain number of headshots or good, quick kills and rapid succession and you're"
3627.46,3634.66, awarded a bonus on your weapon. You air drop into one of five secret hidden locations in each map
3634.66,3638.98," and land on the target and get extra points. You know, that didn't happen in real life. Yeah, so it's"
3638.98,3643.2999999999997," got all this, but you don't get an achievement. You're just killed a notch. Again, it doesn't need to,"
3643.2999999999997,3647.2999999999997," that none of these are wrong because those are fun. Those can be fun game play things, but it's just"
3647.3,3652.26," seems funny that they present it one way because ultimately in this game, it starts to really"
3652.26,3661.2200000000003," go crazy and that at one point, these, these jackbooted, SS guys in gas masks step off this train and"
3661.2200000000003,3668.7400000000002," they're all firing MG42s from the hip, which I'm told could be done, but it's pretty damn ridiculous."
3668.7400000000002,3672.6600000000003," You're not going to be able to reload. You're not going to be able to do anything, but anyway,"
3672.66,3676.98," like aside from that, they get out and, like, okay, this is cool. Like, here comes, you know,"
3676.98,3683.14, the red skulls minions and I start shooting these dudes in the face and I hit him with the full clip.
3683.14,3687.46," Like, you know, right in this guy's grill, he's like, okay, he's still shooting and he's mowing"
3687.46,3691.14," down on my guys and I throw a gammon bomb at him, which just think of basically being like a"
3691.14,3696.42," super powerful grenade. Then, like, a few more rounds and you just deal with stuff like that,"
3696.42,3700.2599999999998," you know, increasingly, it's like, okay, well, this is interesting and I just kind of wonder,"
3700.98,3704.9," why don't they, it's like, it's just, it's just something about metal on it. It's somewhere"
3704.9,3711.6200000000003," between Wolfenstein and brothers and Harbour. I was just about to say, I mean, from the, I play"
3711.6200000000003,3715.6200000000003," the big, I didn't get too far, I played like the first level or so, getting into the second"
3715.6200000000003,3719.2200000000003," and it didn't turn into like, cats will almost sound like you said, right away. I mean, like,"
3719.2200000000003,3723.5400000000004," what point does it make that turn where it just goes like, into like, just crazy shitville?"
3724.1,3731.14," Um, I think that's level three. It starts to get level three because then some super troopers"
3731.14,3737.3," come out and they have, um, Panzer-Shrek rockets and they're firing, they're using these for"
3737.3,3741.7," anti-personnel weapons, but they're firing them from across the entire map and they're 100% accurate."
3742.2599999999998,3745.7799999999997," So it's basically, it becomes like, you know, the fireball throwing, uh, demons and doom,"
3745.7799999999997,3748.98," or, you know, they throw it in a straight line and you got to like, juket real quick. Yeah,"
3748.98,3752.74," the gameplay is like that where you let them shoot it, you juket to the side and then you can"
3752.8199999999997,3756.8199999999997," snipe them or something. So it starts to get that way at that point. Uh, and then the,"
3756.8199999999997,3761.4599999999996," then the baddies come out and then the last level was basically, um, a World War II version of the"
3761.4599999999996,3765.54, Death Star of a Death Star run from any of the Star Wars movies where the Nazis have a Death Star.
3766.1,3771.7799999999997," Um, it's a drama. Or, uh, Lord of the Rings, you know, I mean, if if talking was, uh, inspired"
3771.7799999999997,3777.62," by by Nazi Germany and, uh, the, uh, I have Sauron or whatever is equivalent of the Eagles nest,"
3777.62,3782.98," I mean, it kind of like takes it back and, and goes in that direction. Um, so it overall,"
3782.98,3786.5," it's a fun game. It's got, I mean, there's some frustrating just shade about it and"
3786.98,3790.9," little ridiculous stuff. I, it's kind of worth pointing out because it's so funny that, uh,"
3790.9,3797.46," when enemies are on machine guns, like regardless of where of the guns ability to traverse,"
3797.46,3802.02," the gun will fire on you no matter what. So straight down, you can go underneath it and you'll see"
3802.02,3806.3399999999997," like, it's like the, the straight, the tracer stream is coming out of like the vent holes on the"
3807.3,3811.46," so you're looking, there's a guy point here and imagine like the, the bolts are coming"
3811.46,3816.42," outside with that. You just stuff like that. It doesn't kill it at all. Um, it's just, it's,"
3816.42,3821.1400000000003," it's pretty fun game. It's just not, but nor is it like, hey, you have to play this. This is one of"
3821.1400000000003,3825.38, the best games of its category or anything like that. But I don't think you'll be disappointed playing
3827.78,3833.38," it. Well, just don't look those expectations. That's, yeah, yeah, yeah, and it looks,"
3833.46,3837.3," it's, it's interesting. And the game's got a long, it had a long, you know, and, and seemingly"
3837.3,3842.02, trouble development story. It has been a long development on the long. It's switched engines at some
3842.02,3846.02," point. It was caught up in the whole, where EA was going to, you know, force all of its internal studios"
3846.02,3849.7000000000003," to use renderware because they had acquired that. And then they said, uh, this isn't working. We're"
3849.7000000000003,3855.62," going to use Unreal Engine 3 at some point. They had a deal with, who is it that owns Jeep?"
3855.62,3859.78," Maybe it's just Jeep, you know, but anyway, the, the Willys Jeep and they were supposed to be driving"
3859.78,3863.78, segments where you're in the vehicles because they had the license with the official Jeep
3863.78,3869.94," maker and stuff. And that's, uh, it was like, that's, it was like, that's, it was like,"
3869.94,3873.1400000000003," the bullet on that one. And they already made that for me personally. This one's the, like,"
3873.1400000000003,3877.38," make a break for this franchise. Like, if this one's not good, I feel like I'm done."
3877.38,3881.78," It's, so it's just, I don't know. I don't think it, I no longer think it has to be that way."
3881.78,3885.7000000000003," Like, I would say the same thing. Like, they've been de-throwed a long time ago. Yeah."
3885.7000000000003,3889.7000000000003, And they still find they still have their niche. They're just like the B World War 2 shooter
3889.9399999999996,3894.1," series, you know. It's like watching Rambo again or something. Yeah, the little Bayes Pearl Harbor."
3895.14,3898.98," Michael Bayes Pearl Harbor. And the another, just like on that line of thought,"
3898.98,3903.22," another thing is it was originally, um, announced as this can have co-operative bullet to play"
3903.22,3906.8999999999996," and they get rid of that and gave you just, you know, death match, team death match. I mean,"
3906.8999999999996,3912.98," team death match or like a territorial thing, which is basically, you know, triple flag capture"
3912.98,3918.8999999999996," with the twist that you can play an airborne version of these, where the allies air drop in,"
3918.9,3923.86," their spawn is in the sky and then they can land anywhere in the access, they can shoot them out of"
3923.86,3930.26," the sky if you're good. From what? To late, I'm kind of worried that that's not balanced because"
3930.26,3936.42, it's going to be a fun. It's more difficult to snipe so and out of the sky than the advantage
3936.42,3941.06, you get from being able to land right over the flag. You're trying to capture it. Throwing grenades
3941.06,3945.78, on the dudes on the access guys that are trying to recap it and landing or you get killed right
3945.86,3950.34," and you spawn again instantly, nearly instantly, you just parachute and land right behind the guy as"
3950.34,3954.34, he's running on the guy that just killed you and then shoot him with the map so that he's leveled
3954.34,3958.9," design to make it so you just can't parachute onto the flag like it's, you know, no, you could"
3958.9,3963.0600000000004," parachute on anything from the levels I played, you can land on anything and the maps are all"
3963.0600000000004,3968.6600000000003," they're basically just, you know, restructured from the single player. It's still pretty fun though,"
3968.6600000000003,3973.6200000000003," it was definitely more, um, I had a lot more fun with it than I then I have had with the multiplayer"
3973.7799999999997,3979.7, component of a metal of honor game and sometimes just say that. So when do the rest of us get to play this?
3980.42,3986.98," Once you come out, any day, just come for the fourth. Okay. Yo. So look for that at your local,"
3986.98,3993.7, your favorite game store. Is it spoiler time? Is this spoiler time? How are we doing on time?
3993.7,3999.8599999999997," We're out of time. Okay. Oh, we have. Wait, even for the spoiler part? Technically, let's see what happens."
3999.94,4003.6200000000003," Holy crevive. We don't need to do, uh, because we're trying to get out of here to do a, uh,"
4003.6200000000003,4007.86," one up show. They need to set up and photo shoot. Oh, they're doing it in here. Yeah. Let's just slam"
4007.86,4012.02," in jam then. Let's do because I'm done. All right. So should there to rest of us, the three of us will take"
4012.02,4016.98," out for our headsets. So yes, we're about to enter. You guys go wacky. Biochox spoiler territory. Now entering"
4016.98,4020.26," spoilers on, turning it off if you haven't finished. You haven't been to do a little talk about everything."
4021.46,4027.46," I'll let Sean and Sean say they're a good guys, uh, behalf of the rest of us because we're all"
4027.46,4030.7400000000002, leaving while you guys were leaving while you guys. I'm going to go back to play in the game to have it.
4030.7400000000002,4035.38," Go finish it. If you finish it, come back in here. I'll finish it. I'll finish it. I'll have a game really quick."
4036.5,4038.34, Now entering spoilers on. Here we go.
4039.2200000000003,4059.78," All right, so everyone's gone. Just me and Sean. You're in the black curtain room."
4060.34,4064.58," Talking about Bosch Axebathers. Yeah. You've got the good ending, right? I got the good ending."
4064.66,4069.14, Okay. So I saved all the little sister. It wasn't even a question in my mind that I was going to
4069.14,4073.46," do that right from the beginning. Even though I knew, like theoretically, I wouldn't have as much"
4073.46,4078.66," atom or whatever. I was just like, okay, they wouldn't make it so that it's that hard to do the"
4078.66,4082.98," good ending. Because it's just psychologically, I think most people like see a little girl they want to"
4082.98,4087.94, save it. Right. So I think the designers would have like designed so that it wouldn't be that
4088.02,4093.2200000000003, hard. Yeah. So that was my thinking. And I wanted to play again because
4095.14,4101.3," I thought, you know, oh my god, so much as like, the hinges on saving these little stitches"
4101.3,4106.74," and this ending. And even the transition of moment, I can confirm now because I got the bad ending."
4106.74,4111.7, I suspect the only difference period is the ending movie that they play at the end. That's what I
4111.7,4116.34," heard. Yeah, because which is pretty bogus. That is kind of bogus. Like, let me get this out of"
4116.34,4120.26," the way too. Like, if you, if you would ask me for my thoughts on the game at any time,"
4121.06,4126.18," you know, that I was playing through it, and it still is. I think it's phenomenal game. It's"
4126.18,4130.900000000001, gorgeous game and it's great in so many ways. But because I just beat it last night and I got the
4130.900000000001,4138.02," bell ending, I'm kind of want to talk about that because I like it so much and I want it to be,"
4138.02,4143.54," you know, just stellar game and every respect. And since that ending kind of like showed me a lot"
4143.7,4147.46," of stuff about the game that was kind of like, eh, why don't something a little better there?"
4147.46,4150.42," So for me here, let's get out of the way. We'll go to the bad ending and then you can certainly"
4150.42,4155.94, what the good ending is. So I went there. I got to the bad ending through an indirect route.
4155.94,4162.0199999999995," I saved the first little sister. Okay. Then after that, I was like, and whatever, and then so I"
4162.0199999999995,4167.22, harvested her. Okay. And then I continued to harvest little sisters for some time all the way up until
4167.22,4173.62," the point and then you know, here, spoilers are everywhere that you discover that you are basically"
4173.62,4180.66, a puppet and you're constructed and are being played by Atlas slash Montaine. And after that big
4180.66,4185.7," part, actually like immediately before that, I started it started getting like cross game. So"
4185.7,4194.18," immediately before that before I went and and took out Ryan, I started saving them. So"
4195.14,4200.66, I'm probably saved about five or six before that. So what what of course happens next is I end up
4200.66,4205.22," in 10 in bombs room with all the little girls. And I was thinking at that point like, oh, they must"
4205.22,4209.38, like me a little bit because I've saved quite a few of them. Right. Word has to have gotten back to
4209.38,4213.3," them. And instead, you know, they're drawing with crayons on the ground and they're all in their"
4213.3,4218.18," little nursery and everything they say is like, oh, no, he's the man who hurts us, you know, he's the"
4218.18,4224.58," bad guy. So that's what I assume on the good side, you're in that same place. Right. They're like,"
4224.58,4229.54," oh, he's our savior. Yeah. Okay. So there's a difference. Oh, so they don't they were not"
4229.54,4233.780000000001," more into like the glue eyes or any of those. No, they were all they were all like, wonder if you"
4233.780000000001,4238.1," killed every damn one of them, what would happen? How I know, I wonder like even the numbers. Yeah,"
4238.1,4241.860000000001, like how would they explain that there were some good ones in there who had been saving them.
4241.860000000001,4246.900000000001," Yeah, well, to confirm. Now I have to play it. Okay. So they'll have to play. So after that, then"
4248.42,4251.38," even though that they were, you know, like, oh, they don't like me or whatever, then they still"
4251.38,4255.700000000001, show me how to get out whenever they want to. And I continue to save them from that point on. I never
4255.700000000001,4260.66," harvested another one. And I assume because the way the game was going, I was like, oh, this game"
4260.66,4266.66, is allowed me the option to redeem myself because 10 of them are still talking to me just working with me.
4266.66,4270.9800000000005," Otherwise, why would she unless, of course, you know, she has the interest in getting rid of one"
4270.9800000000005,4276.820000000001," pain. But outside of that, she seemed to be like, okay, it's interesting. Me, you know, of course,"
4276.98,4282.0199999999995," when you become a big daddy, interesting you with little sisters. So I was like, okay, well,"
4282.0199999999995,4284.98," maybe it's like actually putting me back on the good path. And of course, when I do the end,"
4285.78,4290.74," and kind of like to, before we get to that, that was pretty down to you, the boss fight,"
4290.74,4295.0599999999995," the final boss fight. Yeah, I think it was like really out of place. I mean, it was like,"
4295.0599999999995,4299.54," fine, not the game. Yeah, it was, it just did not belong in this game. It was even,"
4299.54,4304.5," the, what have we been able to look at that section? I mean, he kind of reminded me of, I don't know if"
4304.5,4309.38," I came around with his name's Uranus or whatever with the Street Fighter 3 boss. Uh,"
4309.38,4313.94," a counter might be something ridiculous like that. And then his big, you know, his big crucifixion"
4314.82,4318.1," apparatus where he gets the Eve pumped into, I mean, where he gets the Adam pumped into the"
4318.1,4322.18," stuff. So to the little sisters jump on him at the end of years. Yeah. Okay, they still do."
4323.3,4330.42, So you kill him. And then here's where it goes bad. It shows you a video. And so after playing this
4330.42,4334.58," great game, where they took the time to model a dead cat that can appear in like, you know,"
4334.58,4338.9800000000005," three or four places in the entire world or a microscope or something for one environment,"
4339.54,4343.14," then they didn't even take the time to give me an ending more than this quick piece of shit,"
4343.14,4346.9800000000005, tech and type ending where they just play this arbitrary movie and have the time you know when
4346.9800000000005,4350.02," you beat tech in, you're like, what the fuck was that? Right. It's like, it doesn't matter."
4350.02,4355.46," Don't ask questions. It's Nina in the shower. Uh, that's all you need to. So King likes the children."
4355.54,4361.54," Basically, um, a number of bad bad the spheres go to rise to the surface. You're in one of them. And there's,"
4361.54,4366.26," you know, some guys on the submarine that are there and some spliceers come up and kill them. And then it"
4366.26,4371.3," just shows you looking into a pod at one of the, uh, one of the, uh, one of the nukes. Like, oh,"
4371.3,4375.86, you're going to take over the world or something and then it's like the fuck was this. Right. So the
4375.86,4381.78," problem has not only was it just stupid and it felt tacked on, but the whole thing with the game,"
4381.86,4385.7," you know, of course, it's making this big point about agency and the fact that you had a"
4385.7,4392.099999999999, game players have very little of it that that that we are talking to to the people who make the games
4392.9,4395.7," and, you know, the whole way you're going to this game. You're just doing stuff and then it's like,"
4395.7,4399.54," how are you been in our control and it's like, well, you know, you've got the whole meta message there."
4399.54,4405.219999999999," But the one, the one legitimate choice we have, whether or not we harvest the, the, the, the"
4405.219999999999,4410.42," little sisters, goes unrecognized at the end because it's just this ethical binary. Did, were you all"
4411.06,4415.9400000000005," all good or were you all there? There's no redemption. There was no acknowledging the fact that like,"
4416.66,4420.9800000000005," I did have this change heart that perfectly coincided with the character's alleged, you know,"
4420.9800000000005,4427.9400000000005," self-revelation that he is not, I mean, that he is a pop editor. Right. And so instead of it being,"
4427.9400000000005,4432.02," instead of the game reading it is like, this, okay, well, here's an active defiance. Once he learned"
4432.02,4435.62, he was a pop at then he's fighting against it and he's not harvesting many more. That's the one choice
4435.62,4439.7, he can make for himself and he's going to make that. It just doesn't allow you that. And that kind of
4439.7,4444.74," bummed me out. And it made me think of, it made me think of larger about the whole game too, where there's"
4444.74,4449.3," really, um, I mean, because the artwork has gotten thrown around a lot of the game, you know,"
4449.3,4453.22," you know, it's just here's art and variety reviewed it. It was the first game that they've ever reviewed."
4453.78,4457.3," But then I looked at him like, okay, well, so even any care, I mean, even the baseline,"
4457.3,4461.3," the point of entry for, you know, and, and of course, this is the problem with comparing"
4461.3,4465.22, art and one medium to one and another in the same way that you don't expect character development
4465.3,4473.54," and a painting. Many of the, many of the facets that, um, by Ashok Shines in and I would say is art,"
4473.54,4477.54," you know, aren't necessarily the ones that we would appreciate with film and literature."
4477.9400000000005,4482.18," But it did kind of bug me that because the game does, it is concerned with narrative and telling"
4482.18,4486.34, a story that there's really no character development whatsoever. Any of that's there is in the past
4486.34,4492.1," tense, like it occurs. Right. It's a kind of a 40. Yeah, you're in a museum, basically. So, you know,"
4492.18,4496.02," here that 10 of them, you know, had some underwrites and change and stuff. But all the principal"
4496.02,4499.9400000000005," figures that you're playing with now, they're already like they're sort of fossilized into who they are."
4499.9400000000005,4505.14," Yourself included. So yeah, that just kind of bummed you out. So, and you talked about the"
4505.14,4508.900000000001," good ending. Well, the good ending was, and they actually, like, I thought it was really,"
4508.900000000001,4512.34," it was short. I forgot a couple of people here say, oh, it was too short, you know, I didn't"
4512.34,4517.38," quite go in and I thought it was pretty pitch perfect for, but I had, like, saved every single one."
4517.38,4521.700000000001," Yeah, it was long. But, yeah, the game was long, but like the ending itself."
4521.7,4524.42," So, some people are going to play at the length of the movie at the end of the game."
4524.42,4528.179999999999," Oh, whatever. You can, you can say what you got to say in four seconds and get out."
4528.179999999999,4531.46," But what happens is you want me to say what exactly? Just go ahead and yeah, so it was again,"
4531.46,4535.46," I mean, I'll play again, but I don't mind hearing. So, you know, all the little sister jump"
4535.46,4539.78," on Atlas and stab them. And then, yeah, that you come out of, you know, you get the"
4539.78,4543.62," Bathesphere scene, it's just one and all the little sisters are in it too. So, they're coming"
4543.62,4547.78," out and numberding into the world. Right. Then you get a series of really short cuts with some, like,"
4548.0199999999995,4554.98," narration where like, you just see these hands kind of like, one's receiving a diploma."
4554.98,4558.82," And they're girl, you know, they're female hands. Yeah, handing a diploma one, like, getting"
4558.82,4563.3," a ring on their finger, they're getting married. And then at the library last one is several of them on a"
4563.7,4567.219999999999," on a, on a deathbed in your hand is there and your age, you got your little like, link tattoo and"
4567.219999999999,4571.0599999999995," they grab your hand as you die. So, you're like, there's this message that like,"
4571.0599999999995,4576.099999999999," K, you saved these girls. Yeah. So, I thought that was awesome. Like, I thought it was really cool and"
4576.740000000001,4581.54," that's better. I mean, that's less cryptic in it. It sends a lot more interesting than the version."
4581.54,4587.3," They're me. Like, I thought it was like, yeah, that was that was an ending. That's how I felt."
4587.3,4591.9400000000005," Yeah. But like, my name was like, it was the kind of in your face, like, it was blatantly telling."
4591.9400000000005,4595.54," Like, you've got the bad news play again. Like, that doesn't even count. Like, we're not even going to,"
4595.54,4601.14," like, we can't even be bothered to like put together more than 30 seconds of a video for you."
4601.14,4605.700000000001," Right. I mean, for me, the whole game, not even in the history. You know, you're being"
4605.7,4609.94," manipulated the whole time in some fashion because even the way they present Atlas at the beginning,"
4610.74,4614.34," where he's just the voice. You talking about his wife and kid. The first time you see him,"
4615.139999999999,4618.5," you know, down where you're trying to save his family about the bathesphere and it all blows up."
4618.5,4622.5, You never really get a close-up on him. And the bathesphere blows up and you ever see his wife and
4622.5,4627.78," kid at all and you just have to take his bird for it that they're dead. Right. That for me was like,"
4627.78,4632.0199999999995," the moment where I'm just like, okay, something's up here. This is not the guy who I think he is."
4632.0199999999995,4634.98," Yeah. And then even so there, you know, you're being manipulated."
4636.099999999999,4641.62," Even though the most awesome level in the game, in my opinion, the Sandor Cohen level, which one is that?"
4641.62,4647.86," That's the artist. Oh, okay. I love that level so much. That was bad. It was bad as. But like,"
4649.38,4652.34," when they revealed the wood you kind of, well, I was playing it. I was like, okay,"
4653.38,4658.26," why am I murdering these people? Why do I not have the choice to not murder these people? Like,"
4658.26,4662.74," could I, you know, in most in some game, like a co-tor or whatever, you might have some other alternative,"
4662.74,4667.3," like, not just cold blooded to kill these people. Not that I'm, yes. That's very people."
4667.3,4671.94," I mean, they're crazy. Like, in his in his whatever. Right. He locks the door and now I'm suddenly"
4671.94,4676.58," his like puppet to kill people. Yeah, just so you can get out instead of trying to find him and kill him to"
4676.58,4682.0199999999995," get the key. Right. Exactly. Go and do his. So that, that, that, even there, I was like, okay, I'm being"
4682.0199999999995,4686.82," manipulated and let along. This game is, is not so much about the choices, so much as like putting you in"
4686.82,4690.9," these situations and gone, how do you feel about that now that you did that? Yeah. Yeah. So in that"
4690.9,4695.139999999999," of course, it's part of the plan. Right. That you are, I mean, does the reasons you're doing that."
4695.139999999999,4699.299999999999, And it makes you feel really specific. Things like after that whole center come and thing and he
4699.299999999999,4702.9," like, he's coming down his staircase and there's all those like streamers going off."
4702.9,4708.74," I should have placed a second shot here. I'm just like, fuck you. So I guess if you don't shoot him,"
4708.74,4715.379999999999," I was just talking to someone else over aim about this. Like, you don't get the key, obviously."
4715.379999999999,4718.099999999999," And I, like, you don't have to fight him. You don't have to fight him. You're going to sleep,"
4718.18,4721.700000000001," well, you can let him walk away. Crazy. That's cool. That's all. I like that. And you don't, you know,"
4721.700000000001,4725.06, you don't get the key to the chest. But the chest has nothing in it. Really haven't been
4725.06,4728.660000000001," working out yet. And I didn't care. I was just like, I was just emotionally satisfied that I got to"
4728.660000000001,4735.14," blow this. I just figured it because the structure that level was so classic for me, that level is"
4735.14,4742.02, when I started to become a little less pleased with some of the game play designs because that
4742.1,4748.18, one was so clearly part of a tradition of just making that kind of game. We built this environment.
4748.18,4754.34," How do we keep you in it and get a couple hours of of game play out of it? Well, let's have you hunt"
4754.34,4759.540000000001, down for guys and kill them. Let's have you hunt down five of these objects. And it started
4759.540000000001,4763.860000000001," getting into that, which hey, like we love oblivion. And that's all that. Yeah. It didn't, it didn't."
4763.860000000001,4770.34," But again, this is just because I think this game is so rad. You want it to do something out there."
4770.34,4774.42," Sometimes when you're playing it and you, I'm just like smiling. And it's because,"
4775.22,4778.5," you know, it's like it's really so rare for me. It was like since Half Life 2,"
4778.5,4783.38," but the stuff comes together so well. The music. I mean, there could be some like just a"
4783.38,4789.46," right time, a phonographs playing in the corner. Some bizarre nut job is muddling. And it happens."
4789.46,4793.14," You haven't been playing long enough where you hear the guy singing. Jesus loves me, you know,"
4793.14,4798.74," like the night of the time. And it's still all that's coming together. Just, just perfectly,"
4798.82,4802.58," and like, oh, God, this is rad. Like you want to all tab and tell someone. Yeah. So so much of the"
4802.58,4806.66," games. There's a lot of that for that reason that makes me, you know, I'm being super picky about it."
4806.66,4809.86," Now none of these are things like, oh, well, I didn't get a 10 because of this or that. So,"
4809.86,4814.42," right, you know, don't get me wrong in that. This is more like, I really, all the little things"
4814.42,4820.5," guys made an amazing game. And it totally, it's so thankful that it's there. And, but this is kind of like,"
4820.5,4827.0599999999995," now that, you know, you promised us the moon, like, let's talk about how you could have given it to us,"
4827.46,4833.06," in some entirety. Right. That's like, I wonder if I, when part of me wonders if they did want to do more,"
4833.06,4836.740000000001," like, because, you know, you're ending disappointment. I wonder if someone over there got a,"
4836.740000000001,4841.46," had got to say like, there should be like nine endings depending on what you do. And they didn't have"
4841.46,4846.740000000001," the production time to do it or something. I wonder if that was a problem. Because I, I just can't"
4846.740000000001,4851.46," imagine, like, can't live in just going, no, no, there's just two. And either you save all the children,"
4851.54,4856.5," or you raise it ending. And then you still have to, I mean, it still kind of like gives you this,"
4856.5,4861.14," you know, Xenos paradoxes where you're like, okay, well, then do we allow them have the good ending"
4861.14,4867.94," if they save the last four, right, the last three. Yeah, they just say the last one. You got to make a lot of"
4867.94,4872.42," presumptions about what you're thinking. And then again, you can't do that. What's, what's funny, though,"
4872.42,4877.54," is like so much, you know, so much of it's supposed to be this moral choice. And, and most of"
4877.54,4882.34," time, for me, it was really just a game theory choice. Like, it was, it was super, and that could be"
4882.34,4889.22," part of the point, too. Right. But how do we get the most out of, out of this, you know, am I going to"
4889.22,4896.5," get more, am I going to get greater benefits by saving these, or by helping them? And then if you"
4896.5,4901.78," make, and so that, you know, you can get the good ending and not, you know, and not save all of them,"
4901.78,4905.94," then you start, you know, applying the game theory. But I don't mean video game theory, but general"
4906.0199999999995,4910.099999999999," game theory, you know, it would have been a real moral choice if like, if so, you know, you do"
4910.099999999999,4914.419999999999," it maximize my outcome by killing all, but like five, you know, I mean, whatever variation,"
4914.419999999999,4918.5," well, even even you know, you know, going into the moral choice that if you save them,"
4918.5,4921.7, something good to get to happen. They even say that's right away. It would have been like a
4921.7,4926.099999999999," real moral choice if they say, you get half or you get double. Yeah. And just, that's it. And they"
4926.099999999999,4929.379999999999," could have still hooked you up. They could have. But yeah, they've really, it's funny. I mean,"
4929.379999999999,4935.299999999999," they set up. That's their way of saying like, just do do the good ending. Because you're going to hate"
4935.3,4939.860000000001," us if you do the back. I'm glad I did it. I mean, like I said, I wasn't even a question for me."
4939.860000000001,4943.78," I'm just like, I'm going to play saving on this time. Yeah. That's how I always play games. I always play,"
4943.78,4948.5," anytime I have a choice, like in a co-ter or something, always like the purest good guy I can be."
4948.5,4952.5," And I don't know why it is me. I don't know. Did you not like, I think I'm some sort of angel or something,"
4952.5,4959.9400000000005," just how I play these things? Did you think it was, um, it was kind of weird that every figure in this"
4960.0199999999995,4967.0599999999995," world that you interact with directly with the exception of, um, of the girls after you've saved"
4967.0599999999995,4973.7," them and then Ryan, when you meet him is basically a Dick Tracy gun. I mean, you know, like,"
4973.7,4978.9," there's no, there's basically there's no equivalent of an Alex or a doctor, boss man, or, you know,"
4978.9,4983.139999999999," everyone is stuck with the honor. I mean, it's like, yeah, like it would, they look like,"
4983.22,4990.02," to, to something, yeah, I wanted someone to like, that was outside of this world of like, okay,"
4990.02,4996.18," here's just a bunch of like crazy fucking, like, reges, okay, reges, originally. Right. And I don't know."
4996.18,5000.740000000001," I guess I kept thinking, I think that that's what I was thinking when, uh, during that"
5000.740000000001,5004.9800000000005," center come on level whenever was hurting those people. I was thinking, okay, there's gotta be someone"
5005.14,5010.18, redeemable left in this planet. Yeah. And this underwater YouTube. There's gotta be someone out there.
5010.18,5012.9800000000005," And I obviously don't think these guys are gonna be at, you know,"
5012.9800000000005,5016.42," guy in the record store or whatever, but there's someone out there. And they really isn't."
5016.42,5020.02," Yeah. Which is like, I don't know. Maybe that's just like, that was part of the message too."
5020.02,5024.26," I don't really thought too much about that. But yeah, they all look like that. And I don't know why."
5024.9800000000005,5028.9800000000005," I mean, do they ever really explain? Just they're all, do they ever really explain? There's a lot"
5028.9800000000005,5034.42," they don't really explain. Like, like, why the little sisters, like, would have been out there"
5034.42,5038.58," when culture before culture collapsed, like, what were they doing? Like, why did they start"
5038.66,5042.42," that program? Yeah. Where they, and then you get some audio diaries where they're like, oh, I saw"
5042.42,5046.42," a little sister harvesting a corpse together. And you're just like, where did you see a corpse"
5046.42,5050.18," like, why is that, and the corpse is laying around? And you think about that for a second, you're like,"
5050.18,5055.78," yeah, whatever, you know, who cares? Like, that room is that room in the bar. I don't know if you got in there"
5055.78,5061.7," where there was a couple lying on a, like, sturdy old mattress. And like, you get that audio"
5061.7,5066.18," diaries. But they were, yeah, they were the parents of me, shall I wrote, ever? Yeah, it was that room"
5066.5,5071.06," that that dawned on me. I don't know. But I was like the room in the bar. You was like,"
5071.06,5076.42," their chart corpse was your closest, like, connection to real people. Right. And they're all dead."
5077.06,5081.46," But so some of that nonsense, too. I mean, like, they tried to explain, you know, why the little"
5081.46,5087.700000000001," sisters roll, why they're female, why they're young in this and that. But like, I do,"
5088.58,5093.860000000001," for them taking, you know, all things considered, I guess I'm saying, the pieces come together very"
5094.179999999999,5099.139999999999," well. They totally, it was difficult task to say, okay, we want to make this game and we've got on,"
5099.139999999999,5105.299999999999," on one hand, we've got all the stuff that we want to say about sort of in Randy and you tell"
5105.299999999999,5111.46," via visionaries and, and like, just really sort of comment on like this thing taken to,"
5111.46,5116.9," it's just, you know, despicable extreme. Now, we also need to have a game where you fight."
5116.9,5121.299999999999, Right. And we also have to have a game where you have all these great powers because we want to
5121.3,5126.5, allow you to basically freeze things and bring things and have tell can Jesus. And then we'll
5126.5,5131.3, let's find some way to justify and putting all these different things together. So we can have the
5131.3,5136.9800000000005," game that is about, you know, this Randy and this Tokyo, but it's also a game where there's"
5136.9800000000005,5140.42," oil puddles on the ground that are there for you to hit with in sendyary arrows, you know,"
5140.42,5145.860000000001, that there's water everywhere so you can electrify it. I think it's in the rubble real quick. I
5145.860000000001,5149.860000000001, think it's fascinating that we've been talking about this for 15 minutes. And we haven't even got to
5150.0199999999995,5154.0199999999995," like to the game play. We're just talking about like this world that created,"
5154.0199999999995,5158.82," which I think is really telling. That is the, I mean, yeah, that it completely is telling because"
5158.82,5163.0599999999995," like in many cases, there's nothing to even say. I mean, people will do this about Halo and stuff"
5163.0599999999995,5167.139999999999," but for me, this is the point I'm always making in my own biases that will not biases. It's more"
5167.139999999999,5173.78," just like biases in the sense that I played played, you know, Halo and various other games. And"
5173.78,5179.219999999999, that's not the one that moves me in the way that by a shock and half left to do. Where I'm
5180.18,5184.42, appreciative of the world and I feel immersed to an extent where I kind of forget about it.
5184.42,5188.9800000000005, And then there's actually moments. I felt like such an idiot where I would pull up my ice
5188.9800000000005,5197.22," fist or some of my eyes apart. I'm just like, yeah, you know, I'm bad at. So I mean, that's what I know"
5197.22,5202.02, I was like really just like forgetting about being a critic and just enjoying this game.
5203.06,5206.740000000001," So other other things I wanted to say, you know, it would have been, it would have been nice if,"
5206.74,5211.78," you know, becoming a big daddy meant more than just like limited peripheral vision with the"
5211.78,5215.38," helmet on. I mean, it'll at least give me the damn rivet gun or something, you know, right. I mean,"
5215.38,5219.78," even if you're going to have your sweater sticking out, if you like show your arm. Yeah, yeah,"
5219.78,5224.58," you've just like, like, I mean, at least put some put some work in there for the payoff. I thought"
5224.58,5228.58," I thought that whole ask arts, you could want to work well like emotionally though. I did,"
5228.58,5233.86," but I heard, did you did the little sister you were protecting died when you played? Yeah, and I reloaded"
5234.82,5238.58," because they just keep coming out. Yeah. I still, that was another one of those things from"
5238.58,5242.099999999999," it's like, okay, the whole reason she died is just to make you feel bad. And if you're, I'm the only reason"
5242.099999999999,5248.74," I'm reloading because I feel bad. And to me, it was kind of weird that I felt bad. It became a"
5248.74,5252.66," Medal of Honor type moment there though, right? Like, you know, like, okay, you see a corpse and she's"
5252.66,5256.58," going to like divert, you know, her attention to it. You're like, okay, this is one bunch of guys are"
5256.58,5259.94," going to rush me. Right. Of course. It's a quick moment. I'm going to put my head like God, I'm down. I'm"
5259.94,5264.66," talking about my eyes. Yeah. I mean, that the game, that's this goes back to the, this is a game"
5264.66,5268.5," for trying to make it for every possible person. Like, if they had, because that's a good one,"
5268.5,5272.74," it's pretty hard. Right. Probably like that most difficult, at least for me in the whole game,"
5272.74,5275.94," like where you had to like, actually, you had to had to set the traps and stuff. Like,"
5275.94,5280.099999999999," most of the game you could go through without, you know, doing the environmental tricks."
5280.099999999999,5284.5," Yeah, I didn't need the traps for I found that playing with the PC, I didn't, I almost never"
5284.5,5289.379999999999, need the traps because I was so quick with moving between placements and weapons so that I could
5289.46,5294.58," like throw out a decoy. Electric, keep someone grab over to tell a canesis and slam him with"
5294.58,5299.54," something as they're frozen or whatever the case may be, hit him with this gun, you know, electric."
5299.54,5305.06," Yeah, I defined the PC one way faster at that stuff, too. Yeah. I mean, you lose that like"
5305.06,5308.74," pausing moment and you have to, I have to every time I reset my powers on the PC, I have to like,"
5309.46,5314.26," make sure physically in my head go one, two, three, three, four as if I got it. Go. Yeah."
5314.26,5317.22," Like, you know, I have to do the, because if you, in the people in the Xbox one, you just like hold"
5317.3,5321.3," them the shoulder button and pause at the action while the rail menu comes up. Yeah. So you can,"
5321.3,5326.9800000000005," in game time, you're switching instantaneously, but like your own head, it's causing that like"
5326.9800000000005,5330.900000000001, the same disconnect that when you start hacking something in the world freezes. Yeah.
5331.62,5336.900000000001," But yeah, I mean, that sequence, I mean, the whole game, what point rather, they're trying to make,"
5336.900000000001,5342.1," oh yeah, the whole like if you screw up, you get another chance. Like you technically any big daddy"
5342.1,5346.42," fight, all you have to do is just like walk up to him unload your pistol, he can kill you,"
5346.5,5350.02," you'll go back to a fighter chamber, you run back up to him, shoot him and then like, you know,"
5350.02,5354.5," get 10% of his health right time you die. It's like, you know, that was the same issue I would"
5354.5,5359.22," pray where like you're just like, yeah, the penalty for death is just a little bit of time lost and you"
5359.22,5363.78," get the guy who's in a like, Resident Evil 4 or something, though, you know, right, you'd have to"
5363.78,5369.78," reload and do it again. And I kind of do, I like the Bioshaw option more because, you know,"
5369.78,5375.86," rather than just having to do it over and over again, you know, or you can give up on it if you want,"
5375.86,5381.7," or you can, or you can give up on it yourself by hitting your, your load key. I do that because"
5381.7,5387.78," you said, hey, I had to mine things of even, you know, six health packs I wasted them all. Sometimes"
5387.78,5391.46," I'll just do that just because I wanted to do it better, like mentally and just like right and"
5391.46,5396.74, on that way cooler or something like that. I just want to try it like the way I envision myself doing it.
5396.74,5403.139999999999," That stuff is, is really cool. I think of it, I compared it to some of the best boss battles"
5403.14,5408.660000000001," in Metal Gear games, in the Metal Gear Solid games. Like one of my favorite ones, I forget their"
5408.660000000001,5415.06," names are also idiotic, you know, like, turgid octopus or whatever, but which one? The guy, I think"
5415.06,5421.22," it was the guy with the, um, something Raven hit the Vulcan can't chain gun. You fought him the"
5421.22,5427.62," cold storage area in his birds, went and yeah, that's why I'm not in Raven. But you could do that by"
5427.94,5433.14," when you go in there, you lay down mines, you can, you know, use your remote stinger and there's all"
5433.14,5437.38," these different approaches to it. I mean, basically with the big daddy game play and even, you know,"
5437.38,5443.94," some of the regular, uh, AIs in the game, it just, it just really emphasizes that variability."
5443.94,5447.46," I mean, there's, I mean, like you're saying, you set down proxy mines, you can set down,"
5448.58,5452.9," and then you use a decoy to lure him onto the proxy mines that you set, you, um,"
5453.0599999999995,5458.66," hit him with, you know, like I was just mentioning where you hit someone with an electric,"
5458.66,5463.78," electric blast that stuns him, hit him with some, you know, with an explosive, you know, a canister,"
5463.78,5467.78," something with telekinesis, and then run up and hit him with your wrench and that freezes him,"
5467.78,5473.62, switch over to your shotgun and shoot him in the face with an electric buckshot. And that's stuff's just
5473.62,5479.62," so much fun. And also because it's designed similar in the way that fear, in the way that fear"
5479.94,5484.66," levels were designed to allow that, instead of just being a rigid corridor, they create these little"
5484.66,5490.66," spaces with, you know, their multiple entries and exits to any room so that instead of your fight being,"
5490.66,5493.62," okay, I'm going to take cover. I'm going to pop out and shoot and then they're going to return"
5493.62,5497.0599999999995, fire and that's basically how it's going to go until I clear them and then I'll move forward.
5497.0599999999995,5501.3," A lot of times that's how Halo in Halo 2, that's how that worked as well. Right."
5501.94,5505.62," So instead of that, you know, you're running more like a multiplayer experience where you're running"
5505.7,5509.78," you're doing circles and planes squirrel around something, you know, there might be like a bar in the"
5509.78,5513.86, middle of the room and you're going around that while you reload or like get the right ammo loaded
5513.86,5519.94," up into personnel or something. And because they're really mobile too, saying, you know, when we're talking"
5519.94,5524.5," earlier about middle of honor, how just the fact that the AI is just moving around is it's good."
5524.5,5528.9," It's cool in this, but of course, all to another level. I mean AI actually runs to a health station."
5528.9,5532.0199999999995," That's such an awesome thing. Yeah, that's crazy. Good. And that's exactly again when I said"
5532.02,5536.42," multiplayer, that's what a human player would do. Yep. And then, but it's hilarious. I mean you go"
5536.42,5539.780000000001," and you're like, with how did this guy just go? You're like, oh, there's got to be a health thing"
5539.780000000001,5542.820000000001," over there. And then you go around the corner and you hear, like, oh, that hit the spot or whatever."
5544.26,5549.14," That's stuff so much fun just because they don't even the, you know, even the whatever spider"
5549.14,5553.06," splacers where they're running a ceiling, the acrobatics and stuff. Yeah. I mean, they're just like"
5554.26,5558.580000000001," going all every which way and they'll appear and reappear. And it's it's so much fun,"
5558.58,5562.9," inviting them for that, you know. And then when you like catch them, like with the fatal shot right"
5562.9,5567.22," in the middle of one of their summer salty something. Yeah, that's just they kind of just like plot"
5567.22,5574.9," out of it and they're mass above off. I mean, that's really cool. So good. Yeah. What else is say about it?"
5574.9,5578.26," I mean, I'm definitely thinking more about I thought about last night and the first I was like really"
5578.26,5584.42," just on the end. And he was like, really? Because it was so Japanese, too. It was so it was such an"
5584.42,5588.82," ending for an object in your game where they just throw like especially sent, they just throw"
5588.82,5592.34, on a bunch of these things and they won't even keep playing it until you know. There was a dog all the
5592.34,5600.5," time. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I, if you, I don't know, I was so satisfied with the ending and"
5600.5,5605.38," I, you know, my experience was like that was pitch perfect. Just because I guess, you know, I played"
5605.38,5610.42," it the one way that they thought it was supposed to be played, right? I'm guessing that the"
5610.42,5614.5," proportion of people are doing that are doing the good thing. Just around the office, I think"
5614.5,5619.62," only one person did it the bad way. Almost like the nine other people I talked to were like, oh, I"
5619.62,5623.78, saved them all. I didn't want my girlfriend to walk into the room. It was so funny every time I
5623.78,5627.9400000000005, be like either harvesting or saving. I look over my shoulder to make a letter coming in here and she's
5627.9400000000005,5634.9," all this. No, no, no, no. They needed some variety in that little thing is like that. I mean, I"
5634.9,5640.82," understand their limits to both memory and how much, you know, the work you can put on anyone."
5640.82,5644.98," Yeah. I mean, there's a very few missions, you know, repeat themselves and like yeah,"
5644.98,5648.9," because you're just like, how really all of these little sisters look exactly the same. But then"
5648.9,5651.7," when they saved them, they at least had different voices. They had different hair colors. Yeah,"
5651.7,5656.259999999999," they address all it's done on. Yeah. And also two of the guys, like the first time here, like the"
5656.259999999999,5660.58," Jesus loves me guy, you're like, okay, this is like genuinely creep me out. I don't know. The sound is"
5660.66,5665.78, so good in the game. Awesome. There's so much like just ambient noise that comes in. It just the
5665.78,5671.86," right time. And then the water and all big daddy mode just like just sets me off every time. Yeah,"
5671.86,5677.62," shit, there's someone nearby. So I'm like pissed off whale or something. Yeah. And but then, you know,"
5677.62,5682.42," like then you hear it so many times. It just it really just does lose the magic after. I mean,"
5682.42,5687.62," it's just like a 20 hour game or something. Yeah, we can't make every single one of every single"
5687.7,5693.62," minute of that, but it would be nice though. It would be nice. That would be magic future. Yeah."
5694.66,5699.46," I can't think of any game that's like that. No. Yeah, it'll be interesting to see the sequel,"
5699.46,5702.9, which is which is interesting. It's inevitable. But here's the problem.
5703.78,5709.22," Of can't was, you know, we know he doesn't like to spend his time. I mean, his life making"
5709.22,5713.86," same game over and over again. So they're probably going to pass the torches on one. So yeah,"
5713.86,5719.38," but at the same time, if this game is really selling all that as well as I suspect it is,"
5719.38,5723.299999999999," you know, where we're going to start to see like the the breaks of million figures pretty"
5723.299999999999,5730.0199999999995, any day now. He's probably going to want to like continue to shepherd the legacy that he's created.
5730.0199999999995,5733.62," I mean, it would be difficult to make this game and then just to hand it over to someone else."
5734.74,5738.339999999999," Maybe if he can just do like some kind of, I don't know, because he can't, maybe he's got something else."
5738.339999999999,5742.66," It's not just him to make the game. I mean, every part of the work on that, their their designers."
5743.62,5748.98," The writers, everyone is like, you're going to just up front. Yeah, you're going to need all"
5748.98,5753.94, all those people. I can see him at least coming back to it again. I don't know. I think you do something
5753.94,5760.099999999999, that good at people respond this like possibly well to it that like you want to go back to it.
5760.099999999999,5765.3, You want to mess with it some more. You're getting the notice. We got to get out here. But we
5765.3,5768.66, had the other guys who play people will be sick to death hearing about the game. We could talk about
5768.74,5775.3," some other things that we love so much about it later on. And yeah, we out because one up show,"
5775.3,5780.58, you'd stay in the one that you did shoot the intro. We were long. Photos of everyone. We how.
5780.58,5784.58," All right, everybody. All right. We'll catch you next week. We out."
