274.0,276.0, I mean it's fun to make fun of.
276.0,277.0, That's what I meant.
277.0,282.0, So what if you were to be the warhead of that warhead or warcraft book of law.
282.0,285.0, Now would you be making same same fun of it?
285.0,286.0, Since you are steeped in work.
286.0,287.0, Sure.
287.0,290.0, I think what disturbs me about this book is just what we said.
290.0,294.0, It's like the expense it looks like went into this thing.
294.0,295.0, Like.
295.0,296.0, And also here's the other thing.
296.0,298.0, The game hasn't come out yet.
298.0,300.0, That's the part that bothers me.
300.0,304.0, Stop sending me expensive looking free shit Jeff.
304.0,305.0," Well, this is very games."
305.0,306.0, This is this is universe material.
306.0,307.0, This is right.
307.0,308.0, That's not forever.
308.0,309.0, This is for the game.
309.0,310.0, I'm a shop table top thing.
310.0,311.0, I got that.
311.0,314.0, I get that this probably doesn't even relate it to the online game.
314.0,316.0," Jeff, you're dodging the question."
316.0,317.0, What?
317.0,319.0, It's for a warcraft.
319.0,321.0, Okay.
321.0,324.0," If it was a warcraft book, I'd be into it."
324.0,325.0," Oh, like my."
325.0,326.0, I'm a dev.
326.0,327.0, Said unto Kiljayton.
327.0,329.0, That's the whole heart of it.
329.0,332.0, Do you like Anthony who works at my cheese?
332.0,334.0, He we gave him a very acopi.
334.0,336.0, This because Darren had it before he left got a.
336.0,337.0, Got his own.
337.0,338.0, We gave him.
338.0,341.0, And he has a full set of the.
341.0,342.0, Unpainted.
342.0,344.0, Led figures in his trunk.
344.0,348.0," And he like, you know, when he pulls up somewhere, he can bring him out and play."
348.0,351.0, And just in case he runs into some more hammers.
352.0,356.0," Yeah, so it's because he knows as knows that universe and is into it."
356.0,357.0, It's kind of interesting that way.
357.0,358.0, He'll read the books he said.
358.0,362.0," And then, you know, likewise when he plays Dona War, I just got him in a company."
362.0,367.0," Here is when he plays Dona War, I just see a bunch of like shapes and colors and stuff on the screen."
367.0,368.0," And to him, he's like, Oh, God."
368.0,371.0, It's feeling something seeer from whatever.
371.0,372.0, From Nargul.
372.0,374.0, The never planes of Nargul.
374.0,375.0, Yeah.
375.0,378.0," No, it's to eat his own fantasy universe."
378.0,383.0," Yeah, I mean, I've been playing Warcraft long enough that actually started caring about it halfway through this year."
383.0,385.0," Like, I was like, Oh, okay."
385.0,386.0, That's a kind of cool story.
386.0,388.0, I wonder how that one's going to conclude like quest lines and stuff.
388.0,391.0, So I will openly admit that I have not bought the Libricade.
391.0,392.0, Yeah.
392.0,395.0," So I, again, I'm really reacting to it."
395.0,399.0, Is that it's this deluge of stuff we keep getting on this game that's not out yet.
399.0,403.0, And I get that it's coming from the pairing you who we write.
403.0,405.0, You will not be able to play this game if you don't read that whole.
405.0,407.0, I'm going to be sick of it before it comes.
407.0,408.0, That's for a while.
408.0,411.0, Then he even sent the lead miniatures and we sent those.
411.0,414.0, They already who took my I told that story before we do with them.
414.0,419.0," But those things, it's telling Ryan, yes, they're in a fence to the periodic table of elements."
419.0,421.0, It should not exist.
421.0,422.0, They're better.
422.0,424.0, They're worth more melted into a lump.
424.0,429.0," Oh, and we were getting the daily like the handbooks, you know, that dark, dark elf book or whatever."
429.0,430.0, I don't know.
430.0,431.0, Go to the fan for you.
431.0,432.0, What about this week?
432.0,434.0, We also got a book for game cock.
434.0,435.0, It's a new publish out.
436.0,437.0, They are.
437.0,438.0, That was more offensive.
438.0,439.0, In that.
439.0,444.0," This whole book, it was basically, I don't know if anyone listening knows much about game cock."
444.0,448.0," But I mean, what, they're their new consortium of developers or whatever."
448.0,449.0, Mike Wilson.
449.0,450.0, Michael.
450.0,451.0, JOD.
451.0,454.0, He did gathering of developers in a previous lifetime.
454.0,455.0, Yes.
455.0,463.0," So this book, the only game to my knowledge I've released so far is the, I don't know, look at the terrible fury."
464.0,466.0," The, the fecal fury, if you were."
466.0,478.0," So this book that they sent is a bunch of pictures of all the staff, you know, everyone down to like the toilet scrubbers and the phone call the phone answers and they're wearing like this game cock."
478.0,479.0, The game.
479.0,481.0, They're wearing a game cock.
481.0,484.0, It's like a Margot like cock.
484.0,486.0, Is it a male rooster?
486.0,489.0," I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a rooster."
489.0,490.0, It was in a rooster.
490.0,492.0, It was so tired.
492.0,498.0," And they're all just wearing this ugly shit and it looks like, I don't know, it just looks like a came out Marty garage."
498.0,499.0, So some of the hard-earned.
499.0,502.0," Yeah, and they've released fury."
502.0,503.0," It's like, what is this?"
503.0,508.0," Yeah, I'm not in anybody sending you a book of like their, their wacky Christmas party."
508.0,509.0, Imagine how it was.
509.0,511.0," Well, they're the ones that did you'd be."
511.0,516.0, They're the ones that caused a bunch of big stink when they barged the spike video game awards.
516.0,517.0," Yeah, right."
517.0,518.0, 10 Levines speech.
518.0,519.0," Yeah, they jumped up on stage."
519.0,521.0," And again, it's like, you really bastard live your entire life."
521.0,522.0, Sorry.
522.0,523.0," Yeah, they jumped up there and got mad."
523.0,524.0, They didn't win.
524.0,525.0, Right.
525.0,527.0, But I think they've since apologized to him.
527.0,530.0, They haven't realized that that was kind of a lame move.
530.0,531.0, Yeah.
531.0,534.0," Well, they wouldn't have apologized if people didn't take the best."
534.0,535.0, Yeah.
535.0,536.0, Yeah.
536.0,537.0," They were totally, though."
537.0,538.0, Who are you guys?
538.0,539.0, You've released fury.
539.0,541.0," But hey, at least they've put out this great book now."
541.0,546.0," To me, this, to me, this really, it was eerily reminiscent of an iron storm."
546.0,547.0, Exactly.
547.0,552.0," And you know, I'd like to look at one wacky, you know, long hair rock stars."
552.0,553.0, We are.
553.0,554.0, I think that's true.
554.0,556.0," We haven't made a good game yet, but hey."
556.0,561.0," The front of the book, I believe it was titled GameCock Sucks."
561.0,562.0," Oh, yeah."
562.0,563.0, Don't know.
563.0,564.0, It was.
564.0,565.0, Yeah.
565.0,566.0, Probably.
566.0,568.0, It's all the same red cock jokes in it.
568.0,569.0, Yeah.
569.0,571.0, They were.
571.0,573.0," Like, something weren't red."
573.0,574.0, Yeah.
574.0,575.0, I think it's a borders.
575.0,576.0, They got us talking about it.
577.0,578.0, Yeah.
578.0,579.0, I don't want to talk about anymore.
579.0,580.0, Let's talk about it.
580.0,581.0, I got the AMAded Us and GameCock Madder.
581.0,583.0, So the first 10 minutes of 2008.
583.0,585.0," You're not going to get any books anymore, Jeff."
585.0,587.0, Please send me your free books.
587.0,590.0, So we can mock you on our podcast.
590.0,595.0," So before we get into, I mean, we're getting ready for, you know, deciding our games"
595.0,596.0, in the year.
596.0,597.0, Yeah.
597.0,601.0," And all these other words, you want to catch up on what happened for you over the holidays?"
601.0,602.0, Two thousand seven.
602.0,605.0," We all had a good break, which is why no one got a podcast here."
605.0,610.0," But we all, uh, we all stopped working our jobs here and took about 10 days off."
610.0,611.0, That was nice.
611.0,615.0," And I don't know about you boys, but I played a lot of games."
615.0,616.0, And it was nice.
616.0,618.0, It's nice to do them and not write about them.
618.0,619.0, Would you play?
619.0,621.0," Well, the big one I and I blocked about it."
621.0,626.0," And you guys on that was that, uh, that a, uh, I'm not going to say it's name on here."
626.0,629.0, Just because he probably just wanted to say it.
629.0,630.0, I don't know.
630.0,633.0," But some, uh, some listener of this podcast."
634.0,639.0," Had heard me mention a couple of times over the, over the year that I had, uh, been on success"
639.0,640.0, when getting a wee.
640.0,645.0, He was at a best buy on December 23rd.
645.0,650.0," Two days before Christmas, he overheard a clerk at the best, at the best buy in San Francisco"
650.0,653.0, say that they had one in stock.
653.0,659.0," And this guy bought the wee for me, not not, uh, he didn't pay for it for me."
659.0,660.0," He, but he bought it."
660.0,665.0," And then he sent me an email right after he got home and saying, hey, I heard on the podcast that you"
665.0,667.0," You've been complaining, you can get a wee."
667.0,673.0, So I bought this one and I'll sell it to you at cost just what I paid plus tax nothing else.
673.0,676.0," Um, and if you don't want it or you got another one or whatever, that's cool."
676.0,677.0, I'll return it.
677.0,679.0," But, but, you know, I really like the podcast."
679.0,681.0, I appreciate what you guys did.
681.0,683.0, So I did this for you just in case.
683.0,687.0," And so like I wrote him back immediately was like, Oh, my God."
687.0,688.0, Thank you so much.
688.0,689.0, That's amazing.
689.0,692.0," You know, I wanted to make sure it wasn't a scam."
692.0,694.0, It was for real or whatever.
694.0,696.0, And then we arranged for it to happen.
696.0,699.0, And I wrote my motorcycle over there.
699.0,701.0, Like two hours after I got to see him.
701.0,703.0," And I bought it from him, you know."
703.0,704.0, And I could believe.
704.0,705.0, And I could believe.
705.0,706.0, And I could believe.
706.0,709.0," Well, what's, what's funny is my wife was totally nervous."
709.0,710.0, A whole time.
710.0,715.0," She was convinced that it was some kind of scam that, yeah, first she thought like,"
716.0,723.0," Oh, because like a few more details came out like as I was talking with the guy over email and the phone we got on the phone with each other and he was like, well,"
723.0,727.0," Actually, you're going to be picking it up at my cousin's house because I'm even town."
727.0,729.0, So here's my cousin's address.
729.0,731.0," Like, okay, well, should I make the check out to you?"
731.0,733.0," He's like, well, make it out to my cousin because I owe him some money."
733.0,740.0," So it's like, I'm saying, you know, as the fact is coming out, it's like, but he sounded so cool when I talked him on the phone."
740.0,744.0, You could hear his kids in the background and he wasn't going to be there because he was going to like his daughters like ice skating thing.
744.0,745.0, It was so cool.
745.0,747.0, Just some random dude at a playground though.
747.0,749.0," Well, of course, this is what my wife was saying."
749.0,754.0," It was like, well, you hear stories like this all the time and maybe he's just heard him on the podcast and you never know."
754.0,756.0," I mean, you know, where are you going?"
756.0,758.0, I don't even know where this place is.
758.0,759.0, You don't know him.
759.0,764.0," You know, she's like, so she's like, this, you tell you to meet me in the public place."
764.0,765.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
765.0,766.0, So where are you going?
766.0,767.0," You know, my, I'm going to his house."
767.0,769.0," He's like, well, where's that?"
769.0,773.0," So, so I, when I got to, when I got to his house,"
773.0,777.0, I had to call her when I was outside the house to say I was there.
777.0,782.0," And now I'm going in, you know, if I'm not out in 10 minutes, he can probably call the police."
782.0,793.0," And I go in and it's a, so some totally normal looking dude is girlfriend sitting there playing on, you know, on her wee and it just total normal people was all in the up and up."
793.0,795.0," But like, yes, it was like out of there."
795.0,799.0," Yeah, no, it seemed a little fishy, but, but it wasn't."
799.0,801.0, Seems fishy because people don't do nice things anymore.
801.0,802.0, It was actually what it was.
802.0,804.0, It was somebody just being nice.
804.0,807.0," I was not, you know, being set up to be abducted."
807.0,809.0, And so what's the more a story is stated the world?
809.0,811.0," The paste to be the big bus, paste to be Jeff Green."
811.0,813.0," Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna happen then."
813.0,814.0, Are you kids who didn't get away?
814.0,816.0," Yeah, if only you were me."
816.0,817.0, Yeah.
817.0,818.0, Oh.
818.0,821.0," No, I just got lucky and I, I really, we all have one now, right?"
821.0,822.0," I really, yeah."
822.0,825.0," Otherwise, we'd be, yeah, otherwise we'd be jealous of your story."
825.0,827.0," No, I just wanted to thank this guy."
827.0,828.0, First name is Albert.
828.0,829.0," Albert, if you're listening."
829.0,830.0, Thank you.
830.0,831.0, You said you weren't getting much.
831.0,832.0," Why don't you say, blast that out."
832.0,834.0," If they put Albert on Google, they'll know him."
834.0,835.0, Don't know it.
835.0,837.0, Albert and we.
837.0,839.0, And abducter.
839.0,842.0," So yeah, so it all, it all worked out well."
842.0,844.0," I, uh, stopped the."
844.0,846.0, Sean is holding.
846.0,851.0, Can't have a series of conversation with this thing.
851.0,857.0," Sean, fan, they, uh, some kind of like comic book porn in at the GFW office today."
857.0,859.0," Where did we know where, where did this came from?"
859.0,860.0, Came to the GFW office.
860.0,861.0, There's come from Darren's pile.
861.0,862.0, There's no one.
862.0,863.0, No one's in there.
863.0,864.0, Image comics.
864.0,866.0, What is this is some nasty stuff?
866.0,868.0, I don't think that's going to ignore it.
868.0,869.0, In this.
869.0,870.0, Okay.
870.0,871.0, Ty stuff.
871.0,872.0, Okay.
872.0,876.0," So, uh, so I bought the, we, on the way home, I stopped and I picked up Super Mario,"
876.0,879.0, Gauxy and a second controller.
879.0,880.0, Saw.
880.0,881.0, I went home.
881.0,884.0, I played a ton of Wii Sports because you got to when you get a brand of Wii.
884.0,885.0, Yeah.
885.0,889.0, So I got the wife and kid all playing tennis and stuff and they were all amazed.
889.0,890.0," Oh my god, I can't believe it."
890.0,891.0, What are some sweets?
891.0,894.0, So they had the typical kind of mainstream reaction.
894.0,898.0, And then I booted up Super Mario Gauxy and it's as fucking great as he got said it is.
898.0,900.0, We told you that's all we can say.
900.0,901.0, It's true.
901.0,902.0, I have 28 stars now.
902.0,904.0, So I've a ways to go.
904.0,907.0," All right, my name about halfway."
907.0,909.0, I'm always to the end of.
909.0,912.0, When I can finish the game at 60 or whatever.
912.0,913.0," Yeah, like really close to that."
913.0,918.0, Once I finished it's like 60 you wanted to or whatever it is that would think it's 60 you can.
918.0,919.0," Yeah, it's a."
919.0,923.0, So at Chantay that that Keith got 120 stars got all of it.
923.0,926.0," Yeah, I was seeing that those last two stars about to seem meaningful."
926.0,927.0, That breaks me out.
927.0,932.0, They're like last one took probably 45 minutes or an hour just to do it over and over again to
932.0,933.0, Perfect.
933.0,936.0," It was just one of those levels where you just like, how could you even stand doing this?"
936.0,940.0, Can he do this without like wanting to throw the control he wanted to throw it?
940.0,942.0, That was really at that point.
942.0,945.0," I was like, do we need to put the rubber cover on the."
945.0,949.0," Can I want to ask, but all you guys that question."
949.0,954.0," Do you sometimes play this game or games like this one, but let's stick with this game."
954.0,955.0, Angry.
955.0,956.0, Yes.
956.0,957.0, Yes.
957.0,958.0, No question.
958.0,961.0," Like, and then I have to have a like revelatory moment where I'm just like."
961.0,965.0," I could should stop now or I beat it and then I'm like, cool."
965.0,968.0, I rock and then my anger goes away immediately.
968.0,969.0, Okay.
969.0,973.0, But I do it all the time because I used to throw controllers left to dry.
973.0,977.0," Well, I do, I get angry at a lot of games, but for some reason it's games like,"
977.0,980.0, It's games like this that really get to meet that way.
980.0,981.0, I enjoy it.
981.0,982.0, I love it.
982.0,987.0," But if I do something wrong, I get so mad or if my timing is off by like half a second and"
987.0,992.0," you know, my last little little blip of health is gone because I did something lame."
992.0,995.0," I just, I want to, I'll usually blame the game."
995.0,996.0, Yeah.
996.0,997.0, But that there.
997.0,998.0, Yeah.
998.0,1000.0," So infer, why is that electric barrier there?"
1000.0,1001.0," Fuck you, game."
1001.0,1006.0, Part of it's because you have a finite number of attempts on anything.
1006.0,1010.0," And I mean, you can go back even if you run out of all your lives to reload the level, but if you"
1010.0,1013.0," felt like you got to the state of third checkpoint or something, yeah."
1013.0,1016.0, There's that threat of it's not like you just hit F5 or whatever.
1016.0,1017.0, Yeah.
1017.0,1019.0," And if something goes wrong, you're going to just do it again."
1019.0,1021.0, You can't brute force your way through.
1021.0,1022.0, Yeah.
1022.0,1023.0, There's actual old school tension here.
1023.0,1028.0," But the only thing about it, I don't mind the, the old school tension except for one thing."
1028.0,1032.0, I don't like the total game over screen.
1032.0,1033.0, I wish it didn't do that.
1033.0,1035.0, You have to make you fucking reboot the game again.
1035.0,1037.0, You actually got to that.
1037.0,1038.0, Yeah.
1038.0,1039.0, You've never ever seen that.
1039.0,1040.0, I used to receive it.
1040.0,1041.0, No.
1041.0,1046.0," No, because you get so many lives and then when you turn it off, and that's what it's"
1046.0,1047.0, annoying to me is that you lose them all.
1047.0,1049.0, So it's like why do you try to incentive us?
1049.0,1052.0," We know why one ups when, like, turn it on and like they send you an envelope, pull"
1052.0,1053.0, it up.
1053.0,1054.0," So you're like, hey, well, that's what I'm not."
1054.0,1055.0, Yeah.
1055.0,1059.0," See now, I'm at the point in the game where I can go and collect the envelopes at the beginning where I get more."
1059.0,1062.0, But sometimes I'm actually going into the game with just like four lives.
1062.0,1066.0, And I'm going to some new galaxy I've never been to before.
1066.0,1068.0, And I won't make it.
1068.0,1069.0, You know.
1069.0,1072.0," But I'm hoping, I'll take it all the way out to the very start screen."
1072.0,1073.0, Yeah.
1073.0,1074.0, That's the dumb.
1074.0,1075.0," That's, that's, that's, let me, let me, let me put me back."
1075.0,1076.0," There's no, there's 90 for that."
1076.0,1078.0, For the arcade roots.
1078.0,1081.0," But I mean, yeah, I, I've never, I guess I've seen it."
1081.0,1082.0, I guess I've seen it.
1082.0,1083.0," I've been, I've been stuck so much."
1083.0,1084.0, I see that screen.
1084.0,1085.0, Okay.
1085.0,1089.0," For me, which is what I was, I was, I was, I was losing those mushrooms."
1089.0,1090.0, Never really happened.
1090.0,1095.0," But I was going to say on the point of the, the number of stars is that after I got the"
1095.0,1100.0," 60 or whatever and, and rescue the princess and all that, I did maybe three or four more."
1100.0,1106.0," And I could tell that I didn't want to, you know, diminish the overall experience for myself by getting to those"
1106.0,1107.0, points where I could get angry.
1107.0,1108.0, I wasn't angry at it.
1108.0,1110.0," But I was like, okay, I felt I saw it."
1110.0,1115.0," When I went back that maybe the objective was to do a level I'd already done, but race through it."
1115.0,1116.0, Yeah.
1116.0,1125.0," Certain time against myself or to collect purple coins, find all 100 100 in the level, get to a certain point in a time limit again, even if it's not against yourself."
1125.0,1130.0," And it was just, it's like, hey, I like this game for the variety that it presented and all these other things."
1130.0,1134.0," And I'm not going to, I mean, this, this kind of like the DVD extras at that point."
1134.0,1135.0, Sure.
1135.0,1136.0," You know, I have no problem with that."
1136.0,1137.0, I don't feel like I got ripped off of that.
1137.0,1138.0, Yeah.
1138.0,1140.0, I've been a wonderful time game of the year experience.
1140.0,1149.0," And maybe later on when I get nostalgic forward that experience and I want to like, you know, see more, I can go back to it, but I wouldn't recommend doing what he's did."
1149.0,1152.0," Why would you want to like, game that was so enjoyable?"
1152.0,1155.0," Why would you want to end it on that note, you know, you wanted Luigi."
1155.0,1156.0, Got him.
1156.0,1157.0, Got him.
1157.0,1158.0, You got Luigi.
1158.0,1159.0, Wait a minute.
1159.0,1161.0," Wait, I've rescued Luigi once and then he went away again."
1161.0,1162.0," Oh, you mean to play after Luigi?"
1162.0,1164.0," Oh, you can play after Luigi after you get out."
1164.0,1165.0, Is he any different?
1165.0,1167.0," Yeah, he's harder to control."
1167.0,1174.0," So like, you have to put it down for people really like that sort of thing."
1174.0,1177.0," I don't, I mean, people, people, people other than myself."
1177.0,1182.0," But, you know, yeah, they love the same ones who start called D.D."
1182.0,1184.0, For and the toughest difficulty level.
1184.0,1187.0, The ones that say you're not experiencing halo unless you do the same.
1187.0,1188.0, Sure.
1188.0,1189.0," Right. You know, it's like cool."
1189.0,1195.0," When you're playing with Luigi with the broken leg and one hand behind their back, I mean, that's how real men do it."
1195.0,1199.0, That's probably the options in these games.
1199.0,1201.0, You have the option to do all this if you enjoy it.
1201.0,1207.0," But I got to say even at the 20 whatever, 27 stars I'm at or whatever, I've already"
1207.0,1212.0, feel like I've gotten my money's worth because I and we don't have to rehash because you guys went on about it.
1212.0,1217.0," But I do agree in retrospect, everything you guys said about this game's level to sign."
1217.0,1224.0," It, it, it shame so much of the rest of gaming to see a game where every single new"
1224.0,1234.0," screen is something totally new and where the gameplay is so, it's so varied and yet so perfect in so many ways."
1234.0,1236.0, It's just it blows me away.
1236.0,1242.0, I do think that the closest to them on the PC is valve for sure in terms of just being able to do things.
1242.0,1244.0," You see that connection. I mean, we're absolutely."
1244.0,1249.0," Everything comes together so well and it's, and yeah, when you play, you're like, why are all games?"
1249.0,1251.0, Why are all games so good?
1251.0,1252.0, Yeah.
1253.0,1254.0, Yeah.
1254.0,1257.0," There's no, there's no seams at all."
1257.0,1262.0," It's just, it's, you're just, you feel like you're in the hands of people who know exactly what they're doing."
1262.0,1264.0," Just like, please entertain me."
1264.0,1268.0, I also even appreciate the aesthetic that they've developed over the years with it.
1268.0,1269.0," Oh, sure."
1269.0,1273.0," It's so, you know, it's utility, but it's, it's not, it's not straight up anime, right?"
1273.0,1278.0," You know, and it's not like the versions of it that you see in everyone's form avatars and stuff like that."
1278.0,1283.0," And it's got its own sense of, it's just going to well establish five to it now, like it."
1283.0,1289.0," I was, it kind of really enjoying the fact that the plot, they're so, it's so unabashedly."
1289.0,1294.0, The same goddamn thing over and over again. There's something very beautiful about that.
1294.0,1299.0," You know, yep, Bowser's back and he's got Princess Peach again."
1299.0,1300.0, Awesome.
1300.0,1303.0, You need 120 or something else.
1304.0,1316.0," That was, you know, Sarah might, my daughter, you know, she's, she's not as well-versed in, you know, Mario lore, but she came in when I, when I bought this game and she, we played paper Mario together, the first one on the game kidman."
1316.0,1325.0," She watched me put a little bit of, um, but, I was, I was, I called Mario 64 back in the day, but she was tiny."
1326.0,1332.0," And but in her recollection and her mind and her in her kid mind, she remembered that Mario had to rescue Princess Peach."
1332.0,1338.0," So I bought Super Mario Galaxy and I sat her down and we watched it beginning if she was like, again?"
1338.0,1341.0," Yeah, that's all this is, that was a little bit of a shame."
1341.0,1343.0, The same damn thing over and over.
1343.0,1346.0, It's just a facetion. Yep.
1346.0,1353.0," So that's what I did over Christmas. I played a lot of while and I played, uh, didn't know how to rhyme, played a lot of while."
1353.0,1356.0, I played a lot of while. Finally hit 70.
1356.0,1358.0, Fucker. Oh my god.
1358.0,1360.0, It did lapped me.
1360.0,1362.0, I'm still having to hit that point.
1362.0,1363.0, No.
1363.0,1365.0," What did you start playing loud, Ryan?"
1365.0,1368.0, January of 2007?
1368.0,1370.0," Okay, well that's a long time."
1370.0,1372.0, But thank you so much.
1372.0,1373.0, Why so slow?
1373.0,1375.0, You start playing like two dozen.
1375.0,1377.0, I did.
1377.0,1379.0, Why are you so slow?
1380.0,1383.0," You're theoretically, you should've only had ten levels to go once Burning Crusade."
1383.0,1384.0, I know.
1384.0,1385.0, Did you have enough?
1385.0,1387.0, I smell the roses.
1387.0,1388.0, That's what I was saying.
1388.0,1391.0," Oh, you hit 60 like a day before they raise the cap, right?"
1391.0,1392.0, I did.
1392.0,1393.0, Yeah.
1393.0,1394.0, Which was kind of depressing.
1394.0,1395.0, I'm 68 now.
1395.0,1396.0, You don't do that.
1396.0,1397.0, And I have my epic mount.
1397.0,1398.0, You just go to make friends.
1398.0,1399.0, I do.
1399.0,1400.0, I get a new shot.
1400.0,1402.0," Don't you like go, like if someone wants to go to something,"
1402.0,1404.0," you know, won't get you any levels."
1404.0,1406.0," I can the guild, he'll go hang out with them and you'll do it."
1406.0,1407.0, I'll do it.
1407.0,1408.0, I'll do it.
1408.0,1409.0, I don't do that.
1409.0,1410.0, It doesn't raise XP.
1410.0,1413.0," If it doesn't directly affect me, I'm not going to do it."
1413.0,1414.0, Dang.
1414.0,1416.0," Yeah, I'm selfish like that."
1416.0,1420.0, I also realize I do a lot of like leaving games on and leaving.
1420.0,1421.0, Leaving the room.
1421.0,1422.0, I do that a lot.
1422.0,1425.0, That's why my portal time is 19 hours.
1425.0,1427.0, Not because it took me 19 hours to beat it.
1427.0,1429.0," Why do you, what do you leave the room to do?"
1429.0,1431.0, Why do you leave it on?
1431.0,1433.0, Because I have a family.
1433.0,1434.0, Yes.
1434.0,1436.0," Oh, I'm not turning the game off."
1436.0,1440.0," The dish is done yet because I'm thinking, oh, come right back."
1440.0,1443.0, So most of how do you not get picked up as being like a farmer or something when you're
1443.0,1444.0, carried.
1444.0,1446.0," Just like idling around, not responding dating."
1446.0,1450.0," Because I'm not like, because I'm not like sitting there on a, on a no,"
1450.0,1451.0, either.
1451.0,1452.0, I'm not sitting there mining.
1452.0,1453.0, Yeah.
1453.0,1455.0, Sitting there.
1455.0,1457.0, Some of y'all have repeating goals.
1457.0,1458.0, What did you play?
1458.0,1459.0, 19 hours.
1459.0,1460.0, 19 hours on portal.
1460.0,1461.0, Yeah.
1461.0,1463.0, How long did it take you to be portal?
1463.0,1466.0," I didn't put me, I think probably about four hours total."
1466.0,1468.0," Did you finally play that over the break, right?"
1468.0,1469.0, I did.
1469.0,1470.0, Did you beat it?
1470.0,1471.0," Oh, yeah."
1471.0,1473.0," Well, I remember your email over the break about level 15."
1473.0,1474.0, Right.
1474.0,1477.0, It was level 15.
1477.0,1480.0," And it was one of those instances where, you know,"
1480.0,1483.0, bitch and about a problem immediately helped me solve it.
1483.0,1484.0, So.
1484.0,1486.0," Oh, no, it works."
1486.0,1488.0," There were a couple times and that was one of them where,"
1489.0,1492.0," it's just like kind of understanding the logic of how,"
1492.0,1497.0," you know, the kind of propelling yourself through a portal, how that works."
1497.0,1498.0, Right.
1498.0,1503.0," I'm like, once you kind of get that down and you're trained to kind of look at how you can connect the dots."
1503.0,1505.0, It's all good.
1505.0,1507.0, That was an amazing thing.
1507.0,1508.0, I do like the end.
1508.0,1509.0, I love the end.
1509.0,1510.0, That was awesome.
1510.0,1512.0, That was one of the best game endings ever.
1512.0,1513.0, That song.
1513.0,1514.0, Yeah.
1514.0,1515.0," Well, welcome to six months ago."
1515.0,1516.0, Yeah.
1517.0,1521.0," You all told me, hey, you just played this game and you were right."
1521.0,1523.0, Still haven't played by our talk.
1523.0,1524.0, I haven't.
1524.0,1525.0, That's different.
1525.0,1526.0, How's that different?
1526.0,1529.0, Could it be the first version of shooter?
1529.0,1530.0, I would say no.
1530.0,1531.0, It's a person.
1531.0,1533.0, It's now just the shooting.
1533.0,1534.0, You're shooting.
1534.0,1535.0, You're shooting.
1535.0,1536.0, Yeah.
1536.0,1537.0, Yeah.
1537.0,1540.0," It's, you know, please, the first person thing really works with portal though."
1540.0,1543.0," Like, I don't see how it, how you could have it, not in first person."
1543.0,1544.0, Just because of.
1544.0,1547.0, Did you play half life?
1547.0,1548.0, I've never.
1548.0,1549.0, I've never.
1549.0,1550.0, I would like half life.
1550.0,1551.0, You should play that.
1551.0,1552.0, One or two.
1552.0,1555.0," I'm, I'm, I'm assuming I would start with."
1555.0,1556.0, I would say both.
1556.0,1561.0," But portal, like if you didn't recommend half life for you, you'd never get through it."
1561.0,1562.0," No, I'm just being honest."
1562.0,1563.0, I'm not saying that.
1563.0,1564.0," It's like, like, like, two parts."
1564.0,1566.0," But no, it's difficult game."
1566.0,1567.0, It's very difficult game.
1567.0,1569.0," If you're not, I got through it."
1569.0,1570.0, Yeah.
1570.0,1572.0, Try to get nowadays and you'll see.
1572.0,1573.0, Yeah.
1573.0,1575.0," There's, you think, my skills of the client probably."
1575.0,1577.0," Well, it's just, just saying it gets hard."
1577.0,1578.0, It gets hard.
1578.0,1579.0, The later.
1579.0,1580.0, There's a very hard.
1580.0,1581.0, It's a very hard.
1581.0,1582.0," It's a very, very, very, very easy."
1582.0,1583.0, Yeah.
1583.0,1584.0, I'm sure.
1584.0,1585.0, But.
1585.0,1586.0, Okay.
1586.0,1591.0, The game is definitely much easier nowadays than it was back then.
1591.0,1592.0, Games are easier now.
1592.0,1593.0, Most of Mario is.
1593.0,1596.0, So I have two is easier than half life one.
1596.0,1597.0, I think so.
1597.0,1598.0, Yeah.
1598.0,1599.0, Eventually.
1599.0,1600.0, Yeah.
1600.0,1601.0, I don't think so.
1601.0,1602.0, I know it is.
1602.0,1605.0, I actually thought the beginning of two was harder than it.
1605.0,1606.0," Like, it got easier for me."
1606.0,1607.0, I just remember really.
1607.0,1608.0, Yeah.
1608.0,1611.0," Because you're like, start off with the said they really limit your ammo and everything at the beginning."
1611.0,1615.0," And it's just, just, remember sticking it on my head that it's just got easier."
1615.0,1618.0, But maybe I'm insane.
1618.0,1627.0, That's kind of like the early parts of medium on guitar hero three are easier than the later parts of medium.
1627.0,1628.0, It's freaky.
1629.0,1635.0, It's like they put you through a gauntlet of like hard fucking hateful shit.
1635.0,1640.0," And then they go, okay, now here's here's we're just kidding mediums actually like this."
1640.0,1645.0, Like the first three or four songs on medium are just so hard to me.
1645.0,1649.0, So some like weird you have to pass the test and then now we're going to make it easy on you.
1649.0,1650.0, Yeah.
1650.0,1651.0, Guitar hero one.
1651.0,1652.0, Guitar hero three.
1652.0,1653.0, No.
1653.0,1654.0, No one.
1654.0,1655.0, Okay.
1655.0,1657.0, The game I wanted to play more of over the break.
1657.0,1659.0, Just hard work problem was rock band.
1659.0,1660.0, Oh yeah.
1660.0,1661.0, Really hard work problems.
1661.0,1662.0, Really frustrating.
1662.0,1663.0, Yeah.
1663.0,1669.0, We had the infamous drummer broken like you can't downstrum because it's really it's either double
1669.0,1672.0, Strums or doesn't register or if you like trying to hold on to sustain it.
1672.0,1674.0, I'll break in the middle of it.
1674.0,1675.0, It makes pretty much employable.
1675.0,1680.0," But like if you go to the website and to your part of your problem, we're like, you know, there's a bunch of choice."
1680.0,1682.0, Like automatic choices.
1683.0,1688.0," Pretty quickly gets you to oh, you've got one of those where the downstrum broke and just send it back."
1688.0,1696.0," So you know, actually there were boxes at the counter of the store when I was picking up Mario and there are large stickers that they put on all the boxes that says,"
1696.0,1700.0, If you have any hardware defects contact EA.
1700.0,1702.0, Not the store that you'll get as from.
1702.0,1703.0, Yeah.
1703.0,1707.0, They were already like to the point where we know is a box full of broken issue.
1707.0,1709.0, I don't please don't know.
1709.0,1710.0, Yeah.
1710.0,1711.0, Don't get mad at the people that are selling it.
1711.0,1716.0," I've heard who got who had rock brand, especially the first run or even the second run like had that problem."
1716.0,1717.0, Is it mostly the guitar?
1717.0,1718.0, It's the guitar.
1718.0,1721.0, It's one specific problem with the guitar really.
1721.0,1722.0, Our drums are drums.
1722.0,1723.0, Our replacement guitar.
1723.0,1727.0, We came really fast by the way and they have a really efficient system because I think they know they've
1727.0,1729.0, were at least grew it up engineering here.
1729.0,1735.0," The second one, the strummers great, but the you know the the link out where you do the."
1736.0,1738.0, Let's do vertically to get your overdrive for whatever.
1738.0,1742.0, I think they call star power and guitar here or they call it overdrive and rock band same thing.
1742.0,1743.0, Okay.
1743.0,1744.0, That doesn't work.
1744.0,1745.0, Shit.
1745.0,1748.0," So you like lift it up and you're like, come on."
1748.0,1749.0, Do that thing.
1749.0,1751.0, Can you use your old guitar hero guitar with it?
1751.0,1754.0," Um, I don't think so."
1754.0,1756.0," There's some, no, this is somewhere."
1756.0,1758.0, I think did bait over the.
1758.0,1760.0, Like actually letting him do it.
1760.0,1761.0, Yeah.
1761.0,1764.0, Can you use the rock band guitar with guitar hero?
1764.0,1765.0, I don't know.
1765.0,1767.0, Can you use your keyboard and mouse?
1767.0,1768.0, What?
1768.0,1769.0, No.
1769.0,1772.0, Why can't there just be one friggin standard guitar controller?
1772.0,1773.0, I don't need five guitars laying around.
1773.0,1774.0," Yes, you do."
1774.0,1775.0, I've got three.
1775.0,1776.0, No.
1776.0,1777.0, And I have a fourth on order.
1777.0,1779.0, There's another problem with it is I wanted four.
1779.0,1785.0," Like I wanted a second guitar for bass for rock band, but right, you can't buy those yet."
1785.0,1790.0," The reason that I quit guitar hero was because starting the summer, I started teaching myself"
1790.0,1791.0, real guitar.
1791.0,1795.0," And I've been very busy and I haven't had a lot of time to do it, but on this Christmas"
1795.0,1796.0," break, I did have the time."
1796.0,1801.0, And I felt like there were a couple of times where I sat down at the 360 with the plastic
1801.0,1803.0, Fisher Price guitar.
1803.0,1804.0, And I was sick.
1804.0,1806.0, Why am I not playing the Rio Vittar?
1806.0,1807.0, I don't know.
1807.0,1808.0," I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't."
1808.0,1809.0, I don't.
1809.0,1810.0, I don't.
1810.0,1811.0, I don't.
1811.0,1812.0, I don't.
1812.0,1813.0, I don't know.
1813.0,1814.0," I don't, I don't."
1814.0,1816.0, I don't.
1816.0,1817.0, I don't.
1817.0,1818.0," I don't, I don't."
1818.0,1819.0, I don't.
1819.0,1820.24, That's why I like rock band.
1820.24,1821.4, But do you play it?
1821.4,1822.84, I saw you on a lot.
1822.84,1824.16," When I looked at an Xbox Live,"
1824.16,1825.32, the break playing guitar.
1825.32,1827.28," guitar and I think, yeah."
1827.28,1829.32," I was, I was there a bit."
1829.32,1830.64, One was enough for me.
1830.64,1835.08," I got to somewhat excited at the idea,"
1835.08,1836.28," because I had so much fun with one,"
1836.28,1837.92," and then I realized like,"
1837.92,1839.12, I already did this game.
1839.12,1839.96, Yeah.
1839.96,1840.32," To do anything for me,"
1840.32,1842.08," to point on, it's just gonna be"
1842.08,1846.32, these relevant to me tweaks and new songs.
1846.32,1848.16," Like we bought two and played it like once,"
1848.16,1849.1200000000001," and then even bother with three,"
1849.1200000000001,1850.1200000000001," but rock band totally,"
1850.1200000000001,1851.72," like, they've already been figuring out"
1851.72,1853.6000000000001, like they're already working on like two other ones.
1853.6000000000001,1854.6000000000001, Yeah.
1854.6000000000001,1855.6000000000001, Anyway.
1856.96,1858.88," We should take a break, actually."
1858.88,1859.3200000000002, Before.
1859.3200000000002,1861.0," All right, we'll take a break."
1861.0,1862.8400000000001, Let's take a break.
1862.8400000000001,1864.5600000000002, We'll be back.
1864.5600000000002,1865.5600000000002, Maybe.
1865.5600000000002,1866.4," Maybe, well, okay."
1866.4,1867.24," All right, we'll be back."
1867.24,1868.68, Don't tease them.
1868.68,1870.2, We'll be back.

1910.56,1912.0, at your local retailer.
1913.1999999999998,1914.28, Ugh.
1914.28,1917.56," Okay, so we are going to talk about our game of the year stuff,"
1917.56,1922.56," but to wrap up on X-Mus 2007, Mr. Elliott,"
1922.56,1924.6799999999998, you can put a lot of games.
1924.6799999999998,1926.8, I spent most of the time not playing any games
1926.8,1929.3999999999999, and it was kind of cool because I get to read a whole bunch.
1929.3999999999999,1931.32," Yeah, reading is fun, kids."
1931.32,1932.28, It's like a game.
1933.2,1936.12, But I did play some games for get to that.
1936.12,1940.6399999999999, The reading had been on the Teddy Roosevelt cake.
1940.6399999999999,1943.8, So I read the first rise of Theodore Roosevelt
1943.8,1945.56, biography by Edmund Morris.
1945.56,1947.8," It was wonderful that I picked up Theodore Rex,"
1947.8,1950.24," which is the second volume, which covers his years,"
1950.24,1951.52," you know, in the presidency."
1951.52,1953.68, And then Morris's third book is not out yet.
1953.68,1956.16," I mean, 2001 is when he published Rex"
1956.16,1958.36, and I'm waiting for his next one.
1958.36,1960.0," So in between there, I picked up this book"
1960.0,1961.44, that just came out called River It Doubt.
1961.44,1965.68, And it's about to form a president's Amazonian expedition
1965.68,1967.04, down an uncharted river.
1967.04,1968.3200000000002, And this is why this guy's cool.
1968.3200000000002,1970.2," And if you're a gamer, you can steal his name."
1970.2,1971.8, This is also Teddy Roosevelt.
1971.8,1973.24, This is also a big teddy bear.
1973.24,1975.0800000000002," I'm going to move, yeah, after you have him, I'm going to move on."
1975.0800000000002,1977.52, I'm kind of in the presidential biography thing right now.
1977.52,1978.24, I'm enjoying it.
1978.24,1980.04," So after this, I'll probably pick up a few other ones"
1980.04,1982.2," on my way, list from other presidents,"
1982.2,1985.1200000000001, such as FDR and Truman and a few other good ones
1985.1200000000001,1986.76, that are books that are out there.
1986.76,1991.1200000000001, But so the guy is crazy.
1991.12,1994.56," I mean, you have certain assumptions about him."
1994.56,1997.0," Oh, we're a friars, but most people don't even know"
1997.0,1999.6399999999999," if the rifriders were that they fought in Spanish,"
1999.6399999999999,2001.28, American war and this sort of thing.
2001.28,2005.6, But I just wanted to give you a few little anecdotes
2005.6,2008.8, from these books that should interest anyone in this guy.
2008.8,2010.8799999999999, And also the hard thing about reading this is
2010.8799999999999,2013.1599999999999, when you look at politics today and you look at presidents
2013.1599999999999,2015.0, and in the media age and all this stuff
2015.0,2018.28, and the wave at campaigns are run
2018.28,2021.0, and just how different everything is become in politics.
2021.0,2023.52, The sense of like realness that you never have access
2023.52,2026.2, to any sort of authenticity when it comes to candidate
2026.2,2029.32," because it's carefully managed messages,"
2029.32,2030.16, everything that we know.
2030.16,2031.16, And we don't have to reiterate it.
2031.16,2032.92, But then you read about this guy.
2032.92,2037.08," And when he was campaigning for his third term,"
2037.08,2038.92," this was possible because his first term,"
2038.92,2042.96," he picked up as a vice president when McKinley was assassinated,"
2042.96,2044.92, which enabled him to run for third term.
2044.92,2046.96," But wait, did they have term limits way back then?"
2046.96,2047.48, They did it.
2047.48,2048.32, All ready?
2048.32,2049.16, At the time.
2050.08,2054.6," So at this point, he's campaigning."
2054.6,2057.2, He served two terms as a Republican president.
2057.2,2058.7999999999997," And then, but he was never,"
2058.7999999999997,2060.3599999999997, because you know when you ask Democrats
2060.3599999999997,2062.56," whatever who their favorite Republican president is,"
2062.56,2065.3999999999996," it's like Teddy Roosevelt because he was never really,"
2065.3999999999996,2067.04," I mean, of course the party's both,"
2067.04,2068.96," I don't only get two academic fights at the fun ship,"
2068.96,2071.04, but of course the party sort of flip flopped actually
2071.04,2072.92, in their direction and stuff.
2072.92,2076.92," And so, third time, he ended up campaigning as a progressives."
2076.92,2079.08, But the moral of the story is that during one
2079.08,2084.52," of his stops, he comes to the podium and he's getting ready"
2084.52,2086.52, to deliver a speech.
2086.52,2090.24, Someone in the crowd pulls out a gun and shoots him in the chest.
2090.24,2092.04," This was someone who was convinced,"
2092.04,2094.68, a lunatic who was convinced that he was actually responsible
2094.68,2097.08," for McKinley's assassination way back when,"
2097.08,2099.64," at the turn of the century, that made him president."
2099.64,2102.44, So he gets shot in the chest.
2102.44,2104.4, And then he reaches into his breast pocket
2104.4,2108.36, and pulls out a sheet for paper.
2108.36,2110.04, And it's his speech.
2110.04,2112.4, It's got a hole in it and it's covered with blood.
2112.4,2114.6800000000003," He holds that up and he begins talking,"
2114.6800000000003,2116.92," it says, it takes more than that to kill a bull moves,"
2116.92,2119.6400000000003, which is basically what a fucking bad at that.
2119.6400000000003,2122.48," At that point, that's like, you can't kill me motherfucker."
2122.48,2124.2400000000002," And then he's like, you know what?"
2124.2400000000002,2126.0, You fucked up my speech.
2126.0,2127.48, I'm gonna have to extemporize.
2127.48,2130.88, So he set their and extemporize the entire speech.
2130.88,2132.44, Did the whole thing pull it with the bullet.
2132.44,2133.44, With the bullet shot.
2133.44,2134.6, While he was shot.
2134.6,2136.84," And then when off to get the bullet,"
2136.84,2137.6800000000003, it tended to.
2137.6800000000003,2138.52, Holy crap.
2138.52,2140.6400000000003, So I'm writing him in in this election.
2140.6400000000003,2141.84, How he was about to get.
2141.84,2143.48, I don't care that he's dead.
2143.48,2145.56," I mean, that's just like one, I mean,"
2145.56,2148.44," a guy who did that, another thing at one point,"
2148.44,2150.2000000000003," you know, earlier in his life when he was living"
2150.2000000000003,2152.6000000000004, in the decodas and he was basically
2152.6000000000004,2154.92, had sort of a share for all the time.
2154.92,2157.1600000000003, And some guys out in the middle
2157.1600000000003,2158.8, and they were during a Blizzard stole his boat
2158.8,2161.92, off his property and took it down the half-fruits and river.
2161.92,2163.96," And he was like, I need to catch these guys."
2163.96,2165.28, They stole my boat.
2165.28,2166.4, But it's a frozen river.
2166.4,2167.2400000000002, And I don't got a boat.
2167.2400000000002,2168.36, How am I going to chase them?
2168.36,2169.6, So he gets two buddies.
2169.6,2172.1600000000003, They spend three days making a boat.
2172.1600000000003,2173.84, And then so they carve a boat in a Blizzard.
2173.84,2175.28, Get down the same frozen river.
2175.28,2177.44, Chase them for 100 miles and catch him.
2177.44,2179.48, And then turn them over to the clock.
2179.48,2182.12," So and then again, later on, after he'd been a president"
2182.12,2185.2400000000002," and the guys, you know, like I can't remember"
2185.2400000000002,2186.2400000000002, exactly how old he was.
2186.2400000000002,2188.0, But I think it was like late 50s or 60s
2188.0,2189.6, when he did this expedition.
2189.6,2190.44, This is his 50s.
2190.44,2194.28, And he basically goes down the stretch of the Amazon
2194.28,2196.5600000000004, where only one person had charted the headwaters
2196.5600000000004,2198.32, just acknowledged what they existed.
2198.32,2200.36," And everyone's like, well, it's got to go into the Amazon."
2200.36,2202.36, We don't know where it's going to end.
2202.36,2206.1600000000003," So this old ass dude, after he lost that campaign,"
2206.1600000000003,2207.4, after he'd been shot and all that stuff.
2207.4,2208.84," I mean, traditionally through his life,"
2208.84,2210.6000000000004," he, this is turning the history podcast,"
2210.6000000000004,2212.48, but this should be interesting.
2212.48,2215.28," Anyway, he will add some naked breasts."
2215.28,2216.28, Yeah.
2216.28,2218.76, He would always just do something extreme
2218.76,2220.1200000000003, to sort of cope with grief.
2220.1200000000003,2222.2000000000003, They'd cope with loss in his life.
2222.2,2224.0, So he goes down this thing.
2224.0,2226.3599999999997, And it's just an incredible story.
2226.3599999999997,2228.08," Of course, they're running into tribes"
2228.08,2232.3999999999996," that no one, not even, they got ronding their haphazillion"
2232.3999999999996,2236.2799999999997," half native, you know, South American native guy"
2236.2799999999997,2239.72," had even had an uneasy truce with some of the people,"
2239.72,2242.0," the indigenous people, near the headwaters and stuff."
2242.0,2245.56," And even then they would continue to kill the Brazilian,"
2245.56,2247.3599999999997," you know, of European descent when they'd meet him."
2247.3599999999997,2248.48, So they go down there.
2248.48,2250.48, One guy sort of mutiny is kill someone.
2250.48,2252.88, They leave his ass in the jungle.
2252.88,2254.88, Some of their dogs get shot up with poison arrows
2254.88,2255.72, and stuff.
2255.72,2257.32," He almost, the Rosalind self almost dies,"
2257.32,2259.6, but it's just insane reading about this.
2259.6,2261.44," And you're like, now we have like staged landings"
2261.44,2262.84, on aircraft carriers and all this.
2262.84,2264.04," It's just so, yeah."
2264.04,2266.4," And the things he would say, he would offend everyone"
2266.4,2267.92," and please everyone at the same time,"
2267.92,2269.48, but it's good stuff.
2269.48,2271.12," I think everyone, I recommend these."
2271.12,2273.08," And if you like the books every minute,"
2273.08,2274.08, it could be a good game.
2274.08,2275.08, You should pick these up.
2275.08,2276.72, The Rosalind going down the Amazon
2276.72,2277.52, would make a good game.
2277.52,2279.44, He's tougher than Duke Nukem.
2280.36,2281.12, That's the tagline.
2281.12,2282.76, He's tougher than Duke Nukem.
2282.76,2283.64, In between all the reading.
2283.64,2284.48, He's not a content.
2284.48,2285.8," All right, all right, right, quite a few other books."
2285.8,2287.36," Actually, I had it reading three books over break,"
2287.36,2290.7200000000003," but I played, it's like, for the holidays, right?"
2290.7200000000003,2293.44, We ended up just playing our equivalent of comfort games.
2293.44,2293.88," Yeah, yeah."
2293.88,2295.44, Work after you guys in my current one
2295.44,2299.56, and ever still is company heroes posing for us.
2299.56,2301.16, And we just played that like crazy.
2301.16,2302.2000000000003, We got a bunch of games together.
2302.2000000000003,2306.44, People from gaming age forums and I'm still addicted to it.
2306.44,2306.8, I love it.
2306.8,2309.08, To the point where it's just a foregone conclusion
2309.08,2312.2799999999997," now that when I go to bed, I'm thinking about what I'd"
2312.2799999999997,2316.2799999999997, like to put in the expansions and all the random stuff
2316.2799999999997,2317.64," and like a hair band shit where like,"
2317.64,2319.6," you know, I really my dream is to see an Oscar"
2319.6,2323.7599999999998, Eastern front expansion with the Soviets in it.
2323.7599999999998,2327.44," And the crazy, there's so much potential for random upgrades."
2327.44,2329.36," Like, they would actually weld bed springs"
2329.36,2331.7599999999998," onto the sides of their tanks, especially"
2331.7599999999998,2332.52, they did when they got by the time
2332.52,2333.72, that they got to Berlin.
2333.72,2336.56, And they would do this so that when Germans
2336.56,2339.2799999999997," would shoot Panzer-Files and Panzer-Trek's in them,"
2339.2799999999997,2341.32, there's a chance that they would hit the coils
2341.32,2343.4, and bounce off rather than explode on the tank.
2343.4,2344.24, Wow.
2344.24,2345.52, And they did that quite a bit.
2345.52,2347.2," So it's like, hey, 48-meanisha,"
2347.2,2348.56," well, some bed springs on your tank."
2348.56,2350.36," And then you get extra defense against a pan,"
2350.36,2351.84," you know, I mean, there's so many things like that"
2351.84,2353.12, that you can actually put in the game.
2353.12,2354.4," You know, that totally makes sense."
2354.4,2356.7999999999997," That kind of like, I'm Mario Kart power up."
2356.7999999999997,2358.7999999999997, It's something that would happen to me.
2358.7999999999997,2359.7999999999997, It's all real.
2359.7999999999997,2360.64, It does.
2360.64,2361.52, There are throwing banana fields out of the back.
2361.52,2365.08," They, the Russians were pretty damn impressive"
2365.08,2369.0, with what they would do with whatever was at hand.
2369.0,2371.0," Like, from smoking my horca,"
2371.0,2373.16," which was proved to rolled up, I mean,"
2373.16,2376.92, camel shit rolled up in a newspaper to drinking it.
2376.92,2378.36," I freeze rock, a haul to welding,"
2378.36,2381.4, best springs for armor on your tank.
2381.4,2383.16, I bet they're all connected in some way too.
2383.16,2385.3199999999997, There was a lot of progression in front of the man.
2385.3199999999997,2387.6, There was a Russian guy.
2387.6,2388.6, Those Russians.
2391.24,2394.56," Okay, so, all right, gotta hear the web."
2395.36,2395.96, Bring it back.
2395.96,2398.84, And this is true to form one of the most popular.
2398.84,2401.64, Here was of the web involved.
2401.64,2402.7599999999998, Sonic the hedgehog.
2402.7599999999998,2403.7599999999998, We can't get rid of it.
2403.7599999999998,2405.32," I think I think it's like,"
2405.32,2406.16, what is it about?
2406.16,2407.4, We gotta start the new year with Sonic.
2407.4,2409.7999999999997," We need to, why did Sonic bring this at it?"
2409.7999999999997,2411.32, Let's figure out after I read this.
2411.32,2413.72," Okay, because I might have this might shed some new light."
2413.72,2414.56, All right.
2414.56,2415.4, Okay.
2415.4,2417.36, So this poster's name is eternal nothing.
2417.36,2420.16, He frequents the G4 forums.
2420.16,2422.88, G4 game trailers forums.
2422.88,2424.92," And to confirm that this is real,"
2424.92,2425.88, I looked up his count.
2425.88,2428.8, He's been posting things along these lines for quite some time.
2428.8,2430.8," Many times a day, a thread,"
2430.8,2434.1600000000003, and certain themes are repeated every single time
2434.1600000000003,2435.96, without fail.
2435.96,2436.8, And you do your research.
2436.8,2438.52," You don't just, yeah, one puzzle."
2438.52,2439.7200000000003," You don't want to get, you know,"
2439.7200000000003,2440.6400000000003, you don't want to get a fake.
2440.6400000000003,2442.8, Is this gonna be a family unfriendly
2442.8,2443.8, here as of the web?
2443.8,2445.36," They always say, okay."
2445.36,2447.04," So why are you, I don't know."
2447.04,2448.96, It's like you're going into the resolution.
2448.96,2449.48," Yeah, I was, I was,"
2449.48,2452.76, I was resolution to be a little more sensitive in 2008.
2452.76,2454.36, What's gonna have to hold up for a year?
2454.36,2455.92, So what you can be such.
2455.92,2456.5600000000004, Okay.
2456.5600000000004,2459.84, So it's first post is titled
2459.84,2462.6400000000003, about the game franchises that need to die.
2462.6400000000003,2463.88, Sonic edition.
2465.1200000000003,2466.6000000000004, And then God.
2467.88,2469.7200000000003," Oh, and then a bit of context first, dude."
2469.7200000000003,2470.92," He doesn't say it,"
2470.92,2473.6800000000003, but he's talking about super smash brothers brawl.
2473.6800000000003,2474.5600000000004, That's coming up.
2474.5600000000004,2476.76," I mean, Sonic is a character in that game."
2476.76,2479.0," So, okay."
2479.0,2479.6000000000004," He was,"
2480.56,2483.64," Sonic was announced last Tuesday,"
2483.64,2484.6," even today,"
2484.6,2487.0," and later Nintendo and now in Stanton,"
2487.0,2489.16, they don't leave a game until February
2489.16,2491.24, the 10th in America.
2491.24,2493.12, Nintendo better use that time
2493.12,2495.16, to get rid of Sonic.
2495.16,2497.2, Sonic is no longer considered
2497.2,2500.72, Mario's rival because he kissed the human drill
2500.72,2503.88, in the front of Amy fucking rose.
2503.88,2506.24, He had a gun-toting racist stereotype
2506.24,2509.56, for all look unlike in his voice by Jason Griffith.
2509.64,2512.7599999999998," One of four kids got shitty voice actors,"
2512.7599999999998,2515.2," even ripped off Metal Gear Solid,"
2515.2,2517.56, with Sonic Adventure 2.
2517.56,2519.92, Shadow being an artificial life form
2519.92,2522.04," built for combat, like Snake,"
2522.04,2524.84," Rouge being the government agent, like Snake."
2524.84,2526.52, To be of the bosses resembling
2526.52,2528.48," fruity colored Metal Gears,"
2528.48,2530.48," talks about battle weapons,"
2530.48,2531.68," military warfare,"
2531.68,2535.16, and politics ring any fucking bells.
2535.16,2536.2799999999997," If they don't,"
2536.2799999999997,2538.52," Sonic will ruin Smash Brothers,"
2538.52,2540.44," Nintendo, Solid Snake,"
2540.44,2542.12, and Kojima just as he will
2542.12,2545.44," to Mario in the Beijing Olympics crossover,"
2545.44,2547.44," and with that bio-air RPG,"
2547.44,2549.32, he will also bring that group
2549.32,2552.48," and their new owners, E.A. to bankruptcy."
2552.48,2553.7599999999998," Very soon,"
2553.7599999999998,2555.44," Sega will sell to Sonic,"
2555.44,2557.08, any of the better developers
2557.08,2558.68, in hopes that their mascot
2558.68,2562.48, will do to them what they did to his creators.
2562.48,2563.56," When they're not doing it,"
2563.56,2566.24, they'll either rip off these more superior
2566.24,2568.3999999999996, games in ways that would scar even
2568.3999999999996,2571.12," the companies whose Sonic games ripped off,"
2571.12,2573.3599999999997," or take these other characters,"
2573.3599999999997,2576.24, and throw them into their own games.
2576.24,2578.24," Imagine Shadow and Halo,"
2578.24,2580.64, imagine Sonic and Tails and Knuckles
2580.64,2582.9599999999996, replacing Mickey and Donald and Goofy
2582.9599999999996,2584.3199999999997," and Kingdom Hearts,"
2584.3199999999997,2586.4799999999996, and imagine Sonic having sex
2586.4799999999996,2589.04," with Merrill or Rose Mary or Eva,"
2589.04,2591.9199999999996, or even Raiden for that matter.
2591.9199999999996,2593.6," Soon, Sega and Sonic"
2593.6,2595.52, will bring back the video game
2595.52,2597.92," crash of 1983,"
2597.92,2601.2, and nothing can stop it or restore from it.
2601.2,2605.2, All of gaming is we know it will die forever.
2605.2,2606.7999999999997, Wow.
2606.7999999999997,2608.88, This guy hates Sonic.
2608.88,2611.12, Sonic is just like a hates it.
2611.12,2612.88, So then the same day he posts.
2612.88,2614.16, It'll good.
2614.16,2616.3199999999997, Imagine Mario in Snake watching
2616.3199999999997,2617.7599999999998, at least Kis Sonic.
2617.7599999999998,2619.12, This is a threat title.
2620.08,2623.44, Because Mario and Salt Snake
2623.44,2626.24, from Metal Gear are also in Smash Brothers brawl.
2626.24,2628.4, So what's setting them off here is that
2628.4,2630.7999999999997, Sonic is also in their company.
2630.7999999999997,2632.0," So in this, this is what happened."
2632.0,2633.6, This mashup in this guy's head.
2633.6,2635.2799999999997," Yeah, he may be a plausible scenario."
2635.2799999999997,2635.8399999999997, I'm sorry.
2635.8399999999997,2636.72, He's working out.
2636.72,2640.72, So how just Gonstig would these characters
2640.72,2642.96, and possibly the rest of Smash Brothers
2642.96,2645.7599999999998, roster be if they saw a least Kis Sonic
2645.7599999999998,2648.64, like during the awful next gen Sonic's final
2648.64,2650.48, storyline.
2650.48,2652.8799999999997, Do you think they'd want Sonic and Brawl
2652.8799999999997,2655.44, even though he lost to both Shadow and Silver
2655.44,2658.24, like a whip rape the human girl while saying
2658.24,2660.0, don't cry just smile.
2660.0,2663.04, So much he gets killed for no reason at all
2663.04,2665.6, and kissed by that human girl in front of Amy
2665.6,2666.4, freaking rows.
2668.72,2671.6, For me if they did I'd bet they'd be begging for the
2671.6,2673.2, sweet release of death.
2673.2,2675.44, No game character whatever one of
2675.44,2678.4, a human girl rapists voiced by awful four kids
2678.4,2681.12, voice actor Jason Griffith with two million
2681.12,2683.52, knowing forgettable friends including the
2683.52,2686.64, gun-toting racist stereotype in their games.
2687.6,2690.4, At least a character from next gen Sonic.
2690.4,2692.56, Who she has to this awful game is Chris
2692.56,2695.28, wants to be equally atrocious animatronic
2695.28,2698.48, ex the princess of lifeless kingdom soliana.
2698.48,2701.36, Keep bro of the so-called flames and disaster
2701.36,2703.6, and had to demon able to some prison dinner
2703.6,2706.56, body by her father during childhood.
2706.56,2710.48, She likes Sonic and his god-lifeless friends and rivals
2710.48,2714.0, is a plot device thrown in there to advance the story
2714.0,2716.16, in the relationship.
2716.16,2719.92, Sonic is also thrown together at the last minute.
2719.92,2723.36, To order officially linked in this awful story line is
2723.36,2726.3199999999997, opposed to an up-to-liver characters like any
2726.3199999999997,2729.12, interrelationship should be.
2729.12,2730.7999999999997," Yeah, here."
2730.7999999999997,2732.08, Wow.
2732.08,2734.24, What was done?
2734.24,2736.7999999999997, Sonic cheated on Amy for this woman
2736.7999999999997,2739.44, and kept it a secret farmer when he gets kissed by
2739.44,2743.44, Elise and struck a Vami Rose.
2743.44,2746.3199999999997, Had to at least had my feelings one of the main villains of the
2746.3199999999997,2748.48, awful game which died from helpless.
2748.48,2751.04, Trink Amy into getting revenge on something
2751.04,2753.12, for cheating on her for Elise.
2753.12,2756.16, His opponents are just silver and chef.
2757.12,2760.0, I'm gonna get in there.
2760.0,2761.2, There's not much more.
2761.2,2763.6, I don't even know what to say.
2763.6,2765.6, I don't know what to say.
2765.6,2767.2, 10 minutes ago.
2767.2,2767.6, What the.
2767.6,2768.56, He's just so bummed out.
2768.56,2769.2, Okay.
2769.2,2770.7999999999997, He just said understatement.
2770.7999999999997,2772.16, There would be a love triangle.
2772.16,2774.24, Sonic's character would actually develop
2774.24,2776.8799999999997, the storyline would be somewhat decent but no.
2776.8799999999997,2780.3199999999997, The best they did was to turn Sonic into a complete whip
2780.3199999999997,2784.48, all the way to killing him just as in excuse to build suspense
2784.56,2787.36, then have at least be like Chaeo Sam rules.
2787.36,2791.28, Give me the strength to violently rape Sonic's corpse in hopes
2791.28,2794.88, that the wake up and continue cheating on Amy for me
2794.88,2797.28, and then have her kiss Sonic.
2797.28,2798.88, What the fuck?
2800.08,2801.44, Is with the Sonic people.
2801.44,2803.04, That's all you need to say.
2803.04,2805.36, Got to look like the first response to that thread.
2805.36,2806.56, What the fuck?
2806.56,2807.76, What the fuck?
2808.8,2809.76," Well, I was gonna say to that."
2809.76,2812.96," Because this is our, this is the two responses are like"
2812.96,2815.36, what the fuck or you know exactly what he's talking about
2815.36,2816.4, and respond to something.
2816.4,2817.2, Right.
2817.2,2819.44, And you're saying you're so right.
2819.44,2820.08, Yeah.
2820.08,2823.36, What I do make of it though is that they introduced at some point
2823.36,2824.4, in the Sonic games.
2825.68,2826.88, Human characters.
2826.88,2827.36, Yeah.
2827.36,2830.08," So, which is kind of weird because it's like"
2830.08,2832.8, if there's a human character in a Mickey Mouse movie.
2832.8,2834.8," It's like no, it's his land or lunitons."
2834.8,2836.64, It's like this is a world of talking games.
2836.64,2837.52, But that does happen.
2837.52,2838.32, And him and all those.
2838.32,2838.64, Yeah.
2838.64,2839.52, Everyone's in a wild.
2840.48,2841.44," And they don't, you know."
2841.6,2842.0, Yeah.
2842.0,2843.6, So Donald Duck just talks to a human.
2843.6,2846.0, But the Sonic kissed one of the girls.
2846.0,2847.68," So this would be kind of like, uh,"
2847.68,2848.56, nobody's referring to.
2848.56,2849.2000000000003, Like the end of that.
2849.2000000000003,2851.36," Oh, bugs bunny making out with, uh,"
2851.36,2852.08, Elmer Fuzzy.
2852.08,2852.56, I see.
2852.56,2853.36, That's right.
2853.36,2853.92, Yeah.
2853.92,2856.16, That might inspire me to write a really angry letter.
2856.16,2856.48, You're right.
2856.48,2858.7200000000003, But it's not that just the human alone.
2858.7200000000003,2863.6, It's that he did it in front of another of a female animal.
2863.6,2863.84, Okay.
2863.84,2864.0, Wait.
2864.0,2867.52, So if Elmer is like the kind of pegged as the romance
2867.52,2869.6, interest in previous installments of Sonic.
2869.6,2869.92, Okay.
2869.92,2872.0," So if Elmer, this is as if it's over."
2872.0,2877.12, Fud kissed kissed the female bugs bunny in front of bugs.
2877.12,2878.16, In front of bugs.
2878.16,2878.64, Yeah.
2878.64,2882.88, Also it'd be like spitting bugs because this.
2882.88,2884.2400000000002, And not only that interest species.
2884.2400000000002,2884.7200000000003, Seriously.
2884.7200000000003,2885.52, Yeah.
2885.52,2885.6800000000003, Yeah.
2885.6800000000003,2887.84, It's just like it's improper on so many levels.
2887.84,2888.56, Like this is the thing.
2888.56,2891.6800000000003, This guy has this coming at this with like all the rage of like
2891.6800000000003,2895.12," the nirallyist anti misdegenation is from like, yeah."
2895.12,2896.48, This is what it's making me think.
2896.48,2896.96, Yeah.
2896.96,2897.76, Yeah.
2897.76,2899.36, Leave our white women alone.
2900.32,2900.48, Yeah.
2900.48,2903.44, And it's got in that riled up.
2903.44,2903.92, Yeah.
2903.92,2908.32," But from the Sonic key, he's mad at the human, right?"
2908.32,2909.6, Not at the head dogs.
2909.6,2910.8, He's mad at the whole thing.
2910.8,2911.84, It's a little bit of a society.
2911.84,2913.6, Much that he's now convinced that.
2914.48,2915.76, Head dogs should be with head dogs.
2915.76,2918.08," So basically, this is the point at which."
2918.08,2918.8, Shaker over Sonic.
2918.8,2921.1200000000003, The head dog jumped the shark for him.
2921.1200000000003,2922.08, Uh-huh.
2922.08,2924.48, But it wasn't because he made out for what we
2924.48,2925.92, reasons we just explained.
2925.92,2929.28, And he's disappointed that they didn't develop the romance
2929.6000000000004,2931.52, triangle and do something with.
2931.52,2931.84, Right.
2931.84,2932.32, Okay.
2932.32,2934.32," Well, I think reality's kind of the shark for this."
2934.32,2935.84, That's a good idea.
2935.84,2939.92, A bio-are making an RPG involving these characters.
2939.92,2941.1200000000003, And they can do that.
2941.1200000000003,2941.52, Think about that.
2941.52,2941.92, Triangles.
2941.92,2942.5600000000004, Yeah.
2942.5600000000004,2944.0, I was thinking about the possibility.
2944.0,2947.2000000000003," In fact, they're assuming that there's a story to tell."
2947.2000000000003,2950.6400000000003," And that there's a role to play with these characters, right?"
2951.2000000000003,2953.2000000000003, Mm-hmm.
2953.2000000000003,2956.1600000000003," Silence like, because we're all going, yeah."
2956.1600000000003,2956.32, Yeah.
2956.32,2957.52, No.
2958.48,2960.72, But that's how to think about the shape of space.
2960.72,2962.24," Like, let's go back to this."
2962.24,2963.92, Yeah.
2963.92,2964.4, Yeah.
2964.4,2965.6, That anyway.
2965.6,2967.44, There's probably the equivalent of the
2967.44,2969.36, Libre chaotic of Versana got there.
2969.36,2971.6, Either probably is probably read it.
2971.6,2973.04, There's a story for everything.
2974.48,2975.12, I don't know.
2975.12,2976.96, I guess I'm just out of the Sonic loop.
2976.96,2979.28, I just think of them as the dude who runs really fast.
2979.28,2980.64, That's the last time when Mike's.
2980.64,2981.44, That dreams was with it.
2981.44,2982.64, It was so much more than that.
2982.64,2984.88, A thing that ran and jumped and collected coins.
2984.88,2985.2, Right.
2985.2,2985.7599999999998, Rings.
2985.7599999999998,2987.7599999999998," But then like now, like how did it get to this?"
2987.7599999999998,2992.08," And so, you know, for the long time, when I first came upon people wanting to marry Sonic,"
2994.96,2996.56," in that context, you know?"
2996.56,2997.12, Yeah.
2997.12,2999.12," It was like, okay, this is strange."
2999.12,3001.6, This guy is a big mid-Jumps and collects coins.
3001.6,3002.3199999999997, You want to marry it.
3002.3199999999997,3006.16," But now, after a year, after a year's past,"
3006.96,3011.6," I've seen that like, okay, this is really, it goes deep."
3011.6,3012.56, Yeah.
3012.56,3014.88," You know, when you've seen the pictures of people that had like,"
3014.88,3017.6, vire sexual toys that they had put Sonic stick to.
3017.6,3021.2799999999997," I guess I just must be this whole like deeper side to Sonic, we don't know about."
3021.2799999999997,3024.08," But now, no, but this is proof, though, that now I'm like,"
3024.08,3026.32, it's not just that Sonic has crazy fans.
3026.32,3030.72, I really believe that the people making these games are making crazy shit for crazy people.
3031.52,3032.72," They're like, who's our audience?"
3032.72,3033.68, They're feeding us.
3033.68,3034.48, Yeah.
3034.48,3035.12, It's crazy.
3035.12,3035.68, Fruit case.
3035.68,3036.48, What's going sell?
3036.48,3037.2799999999997, What's going sell?
3039.92,3041.84," Sonic, Amy Rose, Elise?"
3042.88,3043.92, They'll pay as money.
3045.68,3048.72," So you think the developers over in Japan like intentionally said, okay,"
3048.72,3052.0, we're going to put this controversial kissing a human girl scene in there
3052.0,3054.16, because they knew people would react with like that.
3054.16,3055.36, No.
3055.36,3056.0, How else?
3056.0,3057.52," Yeah, how else would that end up in there?"
3057.52,3058.64," Yeah, how else would that end up in there?"
3058.64,3060.08, Would that even get in there?
3060.08,3062.64," They're like, this is what we're going to give them what they want."
3062.64,3063.2799999999997, It's summertime.
3065.2799999999997,3066.48, Gave them what they wanted.
3067.2799999999997,3069.6," So the whole thing now, I kind of agree with this kid"
3069.6,3072.16, and I don't want to see that character in Mario.
3072.24,3072.72, Wow.
3072.72,3073.92, I don't want to see that character anywhere.
3073.92,3074.56, You have fully come around.
3074.56,3076.56, You've read so many heroes of the web.
3076.56,3077.3599999999997, You are one.
3077.3599999999997,3078.16," Yeah, point."
3080.3999999999996,3082.3999999999996, I don't want to see that character anywhere.
3082.3999999999996,3082.8799999999997, Yikes.
3082.8799999999997,3083.7599999999998, And I've seen.
3083.7599999999998,3084.3999999999996, Gone to the end.
3084.3999999999996,3086.16, It is a shame that BioWare is making it.
3086.16,3087.04, Why are they doing it?
3088.0,3089.04, Doesn't this happen a lot?
3089.04,3092.72, You get like a reporter sort of guy investigating a cult and then he ends up
3092.72,3093.92, like becoming part of the cult.
3093.92,3096.0, What's about how is BioWare involved in this?
3096.0,3097.92, They're making this on a RPG.
3098.72,3099.2, Okay.
3100.48,3101.2, There you go.
3101.2799999999997,3102.3199999999997, Don't defend them.
3102.3199999999997,3103.7599999999998, How are you going to defend that?
3103.7599999999998,3108.48, I've just wasn't aware that they were involved with Sonic.
3108.48,3108.96, Think about.
3108.96,3111.4399999999996, There was a Mario RPG and I loved the Mario RPG.
3111.4399999999996,3112.3999999999996," Yeah, that was pretty cool."
3112.3999999999996,3114.48," Yeah, but they didn't have interspecies relationship."
3114.48,3117.68," Well, did they think about how much better it would have been."
3117.68,3119.2799999999997," If Mario got it on the phone, if I was one of those."
3119.2799999999997,3120.08, One of the shows.
3120.08,3121.04, Some show.
3121.04,3122.08, Some show.
3122.08,3123.04, That's about that way.
3123.04,3124.48, He's got it always captured.
3124.48,3127.04," He does the plot stuff on the group and he's like,"
3127.04,3128.4, who the hell did that fail go?
3132.4,3135.04, So there was something a little odd between my and this.
3135.04,3135.84, This is a peach.
3135.84,3138.24, That's a little kind of a not-ball relationship.
3138.96,3140.72," All right, let's go to games in the year."
3140.72,3141.44, Right.
3141.44,3142.88, So we talked about PC games.
3142.88,3143.92, We have like five minutes left.
3143.92,3145.2799999999997," Yeah, we're in the middle."
3145.2799999999997,3150.72, Can you allow me to one last quick transition unrelated transition from the
3150.72,3152.88," from the, yeah, I wrote down."
3152.88,3153.92," I was at the,"
3154.88,3158.0," is this how to do with reviews again, but it has to do with movie reviews."
3158.0,3159.2000000000003, Hmm.
3159.2000000000003,3162.0," Um, and I don't know why I'm bringing this up."
3162.0,3163.76, It actually had to be for remember how I found it.
3163.76,3164.4, But there you go.
3164.4,3166.0, Do you have a sort of Jan Wall?
3166.0,3167.04, Yeah.
3167.04,3169.04," You know, he has a whole hat celebrity."
3169.04,3169.44, Right.
3169.44,3172.0," He's a local, San Francisco Barrier movie critic."
3172.0,3174.7200000000003," If you go to her website, I think it's a Jan Wall.com."
3174.7200000000003,3179.44," Axie Wright under it, the, you know, the little subhead banner to her,"
3179.44,3183.76," to her, Jan Wall.com is your favorite movie critic."
3184.2400000000002,3185.44, I love that.
3185.44,3186.96," Oh, really?"
3186.96,3187.84, And are you now?
3187.84,3188.8, The movie thanks.
3188.8,3189.6000000000004, Exactly.
3189.6000000000004,3191.76," Yeah, thanks for calling us your, our, our, our,"
3191.76,3192.7200000000003, anyway.
3192.7200000000003,3197.5200000000004," So, and what she's mostly known for the more than her opinions as a fact that every time she's on TV, she's"
3197.5200000000004,3201.44, wanting to get a wacky hat that shows us how committed to her craft.
3201.44,3204.5600000000004, She is of movie reviewing.
3204.5600000000004,3207.92," Also, she's one of those reviewers where like, she's so offbeat."
3207.92,3208.8," Yeah, she's offbeat."
3208.8,3213.5200000000004," She's wacky and she's, and she talks in that kind of a fugitive like your aunt sort of like,"
3213.6,3215.12, I loved it.
3215.12,3219.28, Kite Runner is a movie you want to take your whole family to.
3219.28,3223.92," I guarantee you'll have a, a great time just don't even think about it."
3223.92,3226.0," Just, why you even have the TV on still?"
3226.0,3228.08, Why aren't you a kite runner right now?
3228.08,3229.28, Go now.
3229.28,3231.52, So that's the kind of review she gives anyways.
3231.52,3233.68, So she has her own website.
3233.68,3237.6," And, uh, anyway, the reason I'm bringing this up is because, uh,"
3237.6,3242.64," because on her website, there is a, uh, you can click a button that links to a"
3242.72,3246.48," commercial, a TV commercial that she did for Armstrong roofing."
3247.2799999999997,3247.68, Right.
3247.68,3250.56, So she's like plugging the fact that she did a TV commercial.
3250.56,3253.68," And then if you actually watch the commercial because you can click the link,"
3253.68,3258.48," it's for how, you know, it's her talking about how she had these like horrible, like, uh,"
3259.7599999999998,3262.0, leaks after some big storm or something.
3262.0,3264.4," So she got Armstrong roofing and she ends it by saying,"
3265.12,3268.3199999999997, now the only singing in the rain I do is outside.
3269.2,3271.52," Because, you know, it's not raining inside of housing."
3272.48,3273.44, Thanks for explaining.
3273.44,3274.56," Yeah, you got that."
3274.56,3275.92, You looked a little washer.
3275.92,3278.64," Well, I just thought, like, God, you know,"
3279.84,3281.04, could you sell out more?
3282.16,3285.7599999999998," I mean, that just was a matching one of us like doing some TV commercial first,"
3285.7599999999998,3288.96," whatever, a roofing company and bringing it in."
3288.96,3290.24, That bitch has nothing.
3290.24,3292.08, Her career has nothing to do with roofing.
3292.08,3295.44, That would be like if we did a podcast and talked about some fucking crazy
3295.44,3299.44," has what had where that viewer who did a commercial, right?"
3299.44,3300.32, Fucking arm.
3300.32,3302.16, It would be that irrelevant.
3302.16,3303.52, Right.
3303.52,3306.08," By the way, I recommend Armstrong roofing."
3309.6,3310.88," I'm just saying honestly,"
3311.76,3314.48, that had a really great experience with them and just wanted to do that for free.
3315.28,3316.48, She's that eccentric.
3316.48,3319.36," Is this your guy's way of saying, you don't want to, what is that?"
3319.36,3321.44, You don't want to start discussing game in the year.
3321.44,3321.92, I do.
3321.92,3323.44, I just like we got five kids left.
3323.44,3323.68, Yeah.
3324.7200000000003,3325.12, I know.
3325.12,3326.96, And I went to the jump rope down.
3326.96,3327.76, I wrote it down.
3328.7200000000003,3330.0800000000004," Yeah, you, those premeditated."
3330.0800000000004,3332.0800000000004," You didn't just like, no, no, it was premeditated."
3332.0800000000004,3335.6000000000004, I like when you're in a public bathroom and you grab for whatever scrap of papers that
3335.6000000000004,3337.5200000000004, like happens to be on the floor to read.
3338.5600000000004,3339.5200000000004, You like do that.
3339.5200000000004,3343.0400000000004," You're saying, you know what, we don't pay for your podcast enough."
3343.0400000000004,3344.5600000000004," I want to, I want to come from here."
3344.5600000000004,3349.28," I know, but it's, it's, I'm trying to convince you why this is relevant here."
3349.28,3350.0800000000004," Oh, you're not done."
3350.96,3352.2400000000002," Well, no, I guess I am done."
3352.2400000000002,3354.2400000000002," Oh, Jeff, come here."
3354.2400000000002,3354.88, I'm hurt.
3354.88,3356.0800000000004," No, no."
3356.0800000000004,3356.88, Let's go on the game.
3357.52,3359.52, Now let's put away the dirty comic book.
3359.52,3363.84," Okay, so we voted on our games of the year this this week."
3363.84,3365.36, I think we're going to say the winners are we.
3365.36,3367.36, We're going to be like we're going to be a little bit to say.
3367.36,3367.92, We're going to be quiet.
3367.92,3373.2000000000003," Yeah, we're going to be coy because we still want people to read the magazine that we do make"
3374.1600000000003,3374.88, on sale now.
3376.0,3376.96, That stores everywhere.
3376.96,3378.1600000000003, It's like the Academy Awards.
3378.1600000000003,3380.6400000000003, They go right like the keep it hidden for a while.
3380.6400000000003,3381.04, Right.
3381.04,3381.84," You know, they voted."
3381.84,3385.76, But we did have some interesting discussions amongst us ourselves.
3385.76,3390.32," We, the editors about the games of the year."
3390.32,3391.84, And what do we want to talk about about that?
3391.84,3395.28," That's what our process, our process."
3395.28,3397.5200000000004, How do we determine the games of the year?
3397.5200000000004,3399.6800000000003, Let's take the fourth wall yet again.
3399.6800000000003,3400.32, Uh-huh.
3400.32,3401.76, Like we keep going into this.
3401.76,3405.2000000000003," I was like, if we, oh, babe."
3405.2000000000003,3406.2000000000003, What?
3406.2000000000003,3410.1600000000003," Well, like if we, if we go in and discuss because some of the things we haven't quite worked out."
3410.1600000000003,3412.8," We have like, well, we have a top 10 games of the year."
3412.8,3413.76, And we vote for those.
3413.84,3414.8, And we did not offer those.
3414.8,3417.84," But in addition, we have these awards that we give."
3417.84,3418.5600000000004, Yeah.
3418.5600000000004,3422.4, And they might be like best level design.
3422.4,3423.4, Special awards.
3423.4,3424.4, Yeah.
3424.4,3426.7200000000003, Best of our direction on stuff like this.
3426.7200000000003,3429.28," And by, why don't we talk about that one?"
3429.28,3435.8," Discussing those without having the decision there, we can sort of offer a window in the process."
3435.8,3436.8," We can discuss, I thought."
3436.8,3437.8, I thought.
3437.8,3438.76, I need just to whatever we decide.
3438.76,3439.76, Right.
3439.76,3442.4, I thought the best art direction discussion was very interesting.
3442.4,3444.4," We could create, recreate that here."
3444.4,3445.4, Yeah.
3445.4,3446.4, I'm just going to tell you.
3446.4,3447.4," Well, there are 10s."
3447.4,3451.4, The shoulders helping me do that without spelling it out for everyone that we're going to be recreating.
3451.4,3452.4, I just got to let the hell.
3452.4,3453.4, That's a problem.
3453.4,3454.4, That's a transparency here.
3454.4,3455.4," Well, that's right."
3455.4,3456.4, That radical.
3456.4,3458.4, So two contenders on that.
3458.4,3459.4, Uh-huh.
3459.4,3463.4, Immediately stood out to everyone being by a shock for art direction.
3463.4,3464.4, This is the best art direction.
3464.4,3467.4, Best art direction in the game in 2007.
3467.4,3469.4, The nominees are.
3469.4,3471.4, Bio-shock.
3471.4,3473.4, Twenty thousand lead.
3473.4,3474.4, There's a sea.
3474.4,3477.4," And uh, and half what I mean, team fortress two."
3477.4,3478.4, Two.
3478.4,3480.4, Those were our top two.
3480.4,3481.4, Those are our top two.
3481.4,3482.4, Radically different games.
3482.4,3486.4, And we need to decide which of the two is going to get it.
3486.4,3487.4, Right.
3487.4,3495.4, And I think how we walked into it is we all had like previously over email at home over the break was kind of to
3495.4,3498.4, write in over email saying I think it's this.
3498.4,3501.4, And then we all kind of came in and there were two votes for the point.
3501.4,3502.4, I think those were five.
3502.4,3503.4, Yeah.
3503.4,3507.4," So then when we started having the conversation, we all, like everyone of us kind of had the,"
3507.4,3509.4," Oh, maybe the other one is right."
3509.4,3510.4, Right.
3510.4,3512.4, I flip flopped at least twice on that.
3512.4,3516.4," But I mean, with Bio-shock, it's, it's."
3516.4,3521.4," What was touch upon in almost all their views and that is just the novelty of this,"
3522.4,3528.4," just scenario in the settings that I mean, to use and ran as a point of departure."
3528.4,3535.4," And I mean, the architecture to use the art deco style and to set it in this time period."
3535.4,3541.4," I mean, how contrary that is to the usual offering of science fiction and, you know, cold war and then, you know,"
3541.4,3543.4," military, historical stuff."
3543.4,3548.4," And to say not only that, but we're going to make this, you know, big, very big budget game on it."
3548.4,3556.4," And then deliver in the way that they did where there's more character and, I mean, when you start that game and you first descend into rapture,"
3556.4,3562.4," the subterranean, you know, the underwater city rather, um, which would make it submarine."
3562.4,3569.4," You look around and you're like, oh my god, there's more effort has been put into this room I'm standing in."
3569.4,3576.4," Then most games, you know, you know, creative design teams will do for the entire project."
3576.4,3584.4, That was actually one of the best game openings ever ever played that playing crash and then the descent into.
3584.4,3589.4, Was so memorable. It was so telling you you were going to be playing something.
3589.4,3596.4," Right. Like you've never played before with the narration from Ryan kind of telling you, you know, what you're in for when you're coming to rapture."
3596.4,3597.4, Great stuff.
3597.4,3605.4," Yeah, it's just, I mean, in the variety between the levels, but just the way that it's all set up, I mean, just realizing that say, okay,"
3605.4,3615.4," imagine you have the submarine city that's supposed to be a utopia for a guy who believes, I mean, for this objective, you know, who leaves the ability of,"
3615.4,3623.4, of man's reason to try and pull for all in the end and that it will sort of correct itself and that you don't have to worry about.
3623.4,3631.4," These other dust-aves, key and aspects of humanity, you know, where we like to tend to be irrational and murder one another when we can get away with it."
3631.4,3634.4," And then you're stuck, you know, and say like, let me catch up."
3634.4,3637.4, Exactly. That's a shooter out of that.
3637.4,3643.4," And so, I mean, that's kind of hard to argue with that. And then you like it."
3643.4,3650.4," Well, when you look at it at a glance, you're like, oh, that is kind of cooler than team fortress two, but then team fortress two."
3650.4,3658.4," You have a game where the visual mark that they've put on this, I kind of, you know, compared it to, I mean,"
3659.4,3664.4," it's just this identity that was there, but it was invisible to everyone. No one knew what it was."
3664.4,3669.4," It was like, okay, we're just going to make this game on the concept level and we'll figure out what it's going to look like later."
3669.4,3673.4, And that was the concept level that was team fortress and then team fortress classic.
3673.4,3683.4," And then when they found it, it makes such perfect sense when you take these games where it's basically one team, a red team and a blue team, fighting for God knows what,"
3683.4,3691.4," and for flags and to stand on control points, you know, and how do we make this seem sensible in any way shape or form it."
3691.4,3695.4," For the longest time, it's always been an interstellar blood sport is the answer."
3695.4,3701.4, You have a bunch of angry ass dudes who just want to like mess each other up to it.
3701.4,3702.4, I'll write it up.
3702.4,3704.4, I've seen the cosmos. Got the oiled muscles.
3704.4,3706.4, Some of our probably prisoners.
3706.4,3707.4, Yeah. Right.
3708.4,3713.4," And it's just like so they found it. And not only, you know, did they hit something that that worked so well."
3713.4,3719.4," It just they're able to take, you know, let them take a symmetrical map like two-four and give, you know,"
3719.4,3723.4, put stamps of identity on the blue base and on the red base to make different.
3723.4,3730.4, And then the characters and to make characters in a shooter is also part of what their art design accomplished.
3730.4,3732.4, So cool.
3732.4,3735.4," And they were, you know, empath either where you're not empathizing with them."
3735.4,3740.4," You feel like, okay, I'm at least getting into playing this role in some capacity."
3740.4,3744.4," And the way I might traditionally have fighting game when say like, oh, like, I play Kent or whatever."
3744.4,3748.4," As opposed to someone who plays Blanca, you know, and it's like, I'm playing a pyro right now."
3748.4,3755.4," And it's like with the way that the facial animations work for the characters, I shouldn't pick pyro because he's the one you can't say."
3755.4,3758.4," But for the way you know, the house guy, the way that they've been to."
3758.4,3760.4, And they've been to the way that they move.
3760.4,3765.4," And all these things, there's just so much like spirit in life in that game because of it."
3765.4,3774.4," Yeah, to me that the art direction in that game made the game be as, as great as it is, you know, that like you said,"
3774.4,3778.4," I mean, the mechanic of this kind of, of this kind of gameplay has been around."
3778.4,3779.4, They've done it before.
3779.4,3787.4," And of course, the original, the original look for team for just two was much more along the lines of other kind of games of this type."
3787.4,3794.4," And it was so surprising when they went this way at first, those first screens that we ever saw the new direction was like, what the fuck are they doing?"
3794.4,3796.4, Why are they turning this into like some weird S cartoon?
3796.4,3800.4," But then as soon as you've sought in motion, though, it's beautiful."
3800.4,3803.4, I had no argument with it as a.
3803.4,3809.4," Dihard team for just classic player and this portion of their audience, you would most expect to be reactionary."
3810.4,3816.4," The same kind of like, you know, where like the the fallout community has a really hard time dealing with change with that."
3816.4,3817.4, Right.
3817.4,3821.4," And so I would, I probably fit the bill for someone who would react that way."
3821.4,3826.4," And when you look at it, there's so much, there's, it would be so easy for them to piss people off."
3826.4,3827.4, Right.
3827.4,3828.4, And yet no one.
3828.4,3832.4," And to such an extent that, I mean, yeah, there were a few people, but they were so few."
3832.4,3836.4," So freakishly few that it was like, they were like self evidently freaks."
3836.4,3837.4, Right.
3837.4,3840.4," But everyone else is like, that this is it."
3840.4,3841.4, Yeah.
3841.4,3844.4, They found what this game is supposed to look like after all these years.
3844.4,3845.4, Yeah.
3845.4,3849.4," It makes it so, there's something so intuitive about it."
3849.4,3851.4, It adds to the accessibility of that game.
3851.4,3856.4," Where it's something like, I feel like an unreal or quaker these other games."
3856.4,3863.4," I think the look themselves might put certain people off into thinking like, I just, I don't want to be part of this."
3863.4,3866.4," Or even a battlefield, you know."
3866.4,3871.4," And this is like more war games for boys, which team for just two as well."
3871.4,3879.4," But that cartoony aspect of it makes it, it just adds a level of, I don't, what is it's like lightness or warmth to it."
3879.4,3882.4, And that cartoonyness is always there in a weird way.
3882.4,3888.4, It's more like a sarcasm with the other games where you blow someone up in the pieces flying and they say something stupid.
3888.4,3889.4, Right.
3889.4,3890.4, Yeah.
3890.4,3892.4, And it only regged the irony of that.
3892.4,3893.4, Like unstoppable.
3893.4,3896.4, We'd only reggestur the people that are already into it.
3896.4,3899.4, Whereas I think this is like anyone can look at it and get it.
3899.4,3905.4," Actually, to me it's, it's a lot like, wow."
3905.4,3915.4," I have to say that the idea of, you know, it's like a triumph of cartoony, less realistic graphics over quote unquote realism,"
3915.4,3921.4," which kind of goes back to the uncanny valley stuff and Scott McLeod's understanding comics thing,"
3921.4,3925.4," which as you get towards more realism, you get towards less empathy."
3925.4,3926.4, Right.
3926.4,3928.4, And yeah.
3928.4,3933.4," And then just, it also heavily stylized material dates much better."
3933.4,3936.4, Like you can go ahead and get you turn on Jack Ryan radio or something today.
3936.4,3937.4, Yeah.
3937.4,3939.4, They would look a hell of a lot better than Shen Me or whatever.
3939.4,3941.4, Picking to drink cast games.
3941.4,3942.4," But, but, yeah."
3942.4,3946.4," I mean, like team, team for just two is going to look fine."
3946.4,3950.4," You're not going to feel, I mean, years from now on the same way that like Vanguard or Everquestor,"
3950.4,3954.4," already looking, you know, Vanguard says, are already going to start looking dated."
3954.4,3955.4, Yeah.
3955.4,3956.4," And, right."
3956.4,3957.4, It all takes us the next upgrade.
3957.4,3959.4, It's like you could still play workcraft.
3959.4,3965.4," And you're like, I'm responding to our direction here, not just the official fidelity."
3965.4,3966.4, Right.
3966.4,3967.4, Right.
3967.4,3973.4," And so I guess, you know, the way we came at both those games, I mean, they're so totally different."
3973.4,3978.4," Well, it's interesting because BioShock, like for all the reasons we're saying team for just two is so great."
3978.4,3981.4," The character design, BioShock, has kind of the opposite thing going on."
3981.4,3982.4, Yeah.
3982.4,3983.4, Right.
3983.4,3984.4, The characters.
3984.4,3986.4, And I'm talking mostly like the splashes and stuff.
3986.4,3988.4, Like obviously the big daddy's are iconic and really awesome looking.
3988.4,3993.4, But like the normal everyday routine enemies you encounter throughout the whole game are kind of like the weakness of it.
3993.4,3994.4," I think, yeah."
3994.4,3995.4, Yeah.
3995.4,3996.4, In terms of the art.
3996.4,3997.4, They still looked.
3997.4,3998.4, I would make fun of them.
3998.4,4001.4, Like there were did Tracy villains when we saw the screens before the game came out.
4001.4,4005.4," And then when you play through it, that's still the sense that you get and all the characters, you know,"
4005.4,4015.4," any credit like a flat player, you know, like that's breath into them is eye off screen through the recorders or the only one for me that stood out was a real character."
4015.4,4021.4," I mean, one of the few that operated as a genuine character and who was actually physically present in the game was Andrew Ryan."
4021.4,4022.4, Mm-hmm.
4022.4,4033.4," Um, maybe could make that case for few of the other guys, but for the most part, they're kind of like play the play to face monsters."
4033.4,4035.4," Yeah, monsters."
4035.4,4036.4, Mm-hmm.
4036.4,4039.4," I mean, obviously they have more dialogue than usual monsters, but."
4039.4,4040.4, Mm-hmm.
4040.4,4043.4, I guess the fort for all I got to kind of stood out for me.
4043.4,4044.4, Yeah.
4044.4,4045.4, Yeah.
4045.4,4048.4, Maybe one of them far more contentious than this.
4048.4,4050.4, And we still have to decide on that.
4050.4,4052.4, I think is best level design.
4052.4,4053.4, Yeah.
4053.4,4056.4, We don't have the one we've done on how to make some of any closer to it.
4056.4,4059.4," And for the most part, this has been going pretty well."
4059.4,4061.4, I think we're going to be making our games in the year.
4061.4,4062.4, Mm-hmm.
4062.4,4065.4, It's like we're like happy that things are make the list.
4065.4,4067.4," And we're like, I don't need to like convince you."
4067.4,4071.4, Like I don't need to convince you guys that company here is just that great.
4071.4,4074.4," And it's like if you didn't play it, and it's difficult, you can't really vote."
4074.4,4075.4, Yeah.
4075.4,4079.4," But it's like I'm happy if like if me and a few other freelancers whatever can convince you that yes,"
4079.4,4081.4," it is, it does belong on this list, you know."
4081.4,4085.4, I'm not like for me in that case I'll be lying if I didn't say the same way for you guys.
4085.4,4087.4," And like burning crusade, right?"
4087.4,4089.4, I'm going to play this game for counter-suffering.
4089.4,4091.4, You can't stop.
4091.4,4094.4," You need to think about, you know, it's placed on your list."
4094.4,4097.4," I mean, that's like the best truest, you know most honest in the game."
4097.4,4102.4," Right. And that's something to think about anytime you see any compilation list, like of, you know,"
4102.4,4107.4," GFW's, 10 games of the year is it's, you know, four or five people is completely different personality."
4107.4,4110.4," You can't play every single game that comes out, you don't want to play every single game."
4110.4,4111.4, Right.
4111.4,4116.4," Well, one thing we are going to do in the magazine this year and maybe it'll show up online too is that"
4116.4,4123.4," we're going to have the GFW quote unquote official top 10, but we're also going to publish our individual list."
4123.4,4130.4," So you'll see how the voting, how we all did and, and, you know, we're pretty up front about what we played and what we didn't play."
4130.4,4136.4," And, and another cool thing about the year, this list this year was, you know, we decided one of our side bars."
4136.4,4137.4, What do we calling it?
4137.4,4141.4, The five games that make us wish we did a top 15.
4141.4,4144.4, Because they're really wishy-washy-side bars.
4144.4,4147.4," Because we're so many of this here and that was a really cool thing, you know?"
4147.4,4152.4," And because, yeah, there were each of us had one game we really wanted on the list that wasn't going to make it."
4152.4,4156.4," And it's like we want at least, we don't want to just write the name of it under our name."
4156.4,4161.4, We want to say something about it and I we think deserve to have been on the list but didn't make it.
4161.4,4166.4," So like, you know, Ryan's case, you know, puzzle quest is one of your contenders, don't name them all, but"
4166.4,4169.4," Mine's top of hotel, hobo cup."
4170.4,4173.4, But so we we really finish up here today.
4173.4,4177.4, We warned everyone we didn't have much time but like if we could say if you think about the level design.
4177.4,4178.4, We're quick.
4178.4,4179.4," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
4179.4,4181.4, We need to come to a conclusion on our own.
4181.4,4184.4," So you guys were putting portal out there, right?"
4184.4,4189.4, I think three of us and our little email thread had said portal like I was on the popped in my mind.
4189.4,4193.4," But then, but you're I give me was that's all that that game is, right?"
4193.4,4194.4, Right.
4194.4,4204.4," Yeah, the the trappings that I think are really resonating so much with people, the ending, the dialogue and the way that the game's put together, the pacing of it and stuff is the gameplay."
4204.4,4207.4," It's like it's really all it is, is level design."
4207.4,4210.4," So I mean, that doesn't mean that it can't win best level."
4210.4,4211.4, Right.
4211.4,4213.4," If it happens, it would be that it's like able to sign all the way through."
4213.4,4220.4," Yeah, but it's like, I mean, my thinking was we got this game that teaches you this completely new concept and"
4220.4,4231.4," does it and presents it in such a way that you're learning all these things never bored with the things and always learning new things throughout the entire game, even though, you know, three hours or whatever."
4231.4,4235.4, I thought that was it was just the pacing I think that was that was taking out in my head.
4235.4,4238.4, And then like even the transition from
4239.4,4242.4, the stability to the behind the wall stuff.
4242.4,4246.4, I thought they managed to like make that plausible.
4246.4,4247.4, That's what I was thinking.
4247.4,4248.4, Right.
4248.4,4253.4, This is the hard thing that these words do is like slicing what falls under which category.
4253.4,4254.4, Yeah.
4254.4,4256.4, We have an award for innovation for grace innovation.
4256.4,4258.4, We have one for narrative.
4258.4,4262.4," And so there's a list there's ways in which some of the same attributes we're talking about,"
4262.4,4266.4," qualify for right to these categories, you know, right?"
4266.4,4267.4, Absolutely.
4267.4,4269.4, But I guess that does I mean that that makes sense.
4269.4,4280.4," I mean, think of like, is the level design just, I mean, it is it everything including the textures on the environment that make it seem, you know,"
4280.4,4281.4, the way that it seems.
4281.4,4282.4, Right.
4282.4,4284.4," Part of that is like art direction, you know,"
4284.4,4285.4," ah, this cross."
4285.4,4294.4," So the fact that we have art direction and then the level design thinking about if you were a level designer and you're making this like, how do you want?"
4294.4,4296.4," I mean, just this one level to be great."
4296.4,4299.4, This is your say your job is to make this one level for this game.
4299.4,4300.4, Mm-hmm.
4300.4,4307.4," And you the things that you're thinking about most, you know, and the the purest level about players path and progression through it,"
4307.4,4318.4," ability to interact how, how basically you're aside from the story and all this other stuff, how just through interacting with the game mechanics, you're going to spend your time in this level."
4318.4,4321.4," Well, that's why best level design is super Mario Galaxy."
4322.4,4327.4," It's got it's not every single damn thing you do, but that's not your to do."
4327.4,4333.4," So this is one reason why I nominated both crisis and stocker, but for me, you know,"
4333.4,4338.4," all the times I talked about crisis, and then I don't want to forget about stocker because it came out so early in the year."
4338.4,4342.4," But their approach to that to all the things I just, you know,"
4342.4,4350.4, talked about is very unique and I think offers like a new model for ways that people that make these kind of games can go forward and learn a lot for them.
4350.4,4358.4," And especially, you know, with stocker when the came out, I was talking about the essential strangeness of it to at least one compared to games developed north America."
4358.4,4367.4," Things that they, they're they're assuming a certain degree of intelligence on the players part that I don't feel I see so often in American design games."
4367.4,4374.4," And not because American designers think that they're audience to say idiots, but it's like they want to sell it."
4374.4,4376.4, They need accessibility and every level.
4376.4,4377.4, They have to sell it.
4377.4,4381.4, I think assuming that the American are just to fight and making the game in the front place.
4381.4,4386.4, I think I would think assuming that the audiences a bunch of idiots is probably fairly safe bed.
4386.4,4393.4, I think the it's more that there is an assumption that a few members of your audience that you need to open are idiots.
4393.4,4395.4, Not everyone.
4395.4,4396.4," Yeah, no."
4396.4,4397.4, I think that's more.
4397.4,4399.4," Yeah, it's basically."
4399.4,4405.4," So, and that's what I kind of like, I, you know, congratulated a stocker for."
4405.4,4409.4, We're even some worried about leaving some for leaving some gamers behind.
4409.4,4410.4," Fuck you, you're stupid."
4410.4,4413.4, I'm not thinking if you want.
4413.4,4415.4, So you already have your money.
4415.4,4416.4," Yeah, yeah."
4416.4,4418.4, I can't return it.
4418.4,4419.4, It's open.
4419.4,4422.4," And any others for this category, it's like we don't."
4422.4,4424.4," And then that this is like does a bio shot fit into there, too."
4424.4,4428.4," Like you're talking, you're talking about the crossover between our direction and level level."
4428.4,4429.4, Right.
4429.4,4434.4," And like, and bio shot does a good job of creating levels that allow you to move that."
4434.4,4436.4, Facilitate.
4436.4,4438.4, You using your powers creatively.
4438.4,4439.4, Mm-hmm.
4439.4,4442.4, And that give the AI room to show off what they can do.
4442.4,4447.4, That chasing you around rather than just coming out and dying as soon as you shoot them.
4447.4,4453.4, Invite you to think of the different stages where like a big daddy fight for example would be ideal.
4453.4,4455.4," Like you remember, okay, this was here this was here."
4455.4,4458.4," I could use this again to, and I'm going to try to draw a whole lot of things."
4458.4,4459.4, Right.
4459.4,4462.4," Yeah, these big, uh, just feeders for the battle that's going to play out."
4462.4,4468.4," Like, you know, if we're going to have big daddy's going through this area, we need to have places where they could chase you or you can take cover."
4468.4,4469.4, Yeah.
4469.4,4471.4, We might want to have puddles so that you can electrocute them.
4471.4,4473.4, We might want to have flammable materials here.
4473.4,4476.4," And I think some of that gets for gotten, like, you know,"
4476.4,4480.4," now that bio shot's been out for a little while, some of that gets forgotten because people remember."
4480.4,4483.4," Oh, but there was like an escorted mission and now there were some fetch quests."
4483.4,4489.4, So maybe like those stick out in their heads more than this other stuff we're talking about just a more organic.
4489.4,4490.4, Yeah.
4490.4,4495.4," A lot of people have done this sort of, you know, turned on by a shot."
4495.4,4496.4," Yeah, I know."
4496.4,4499.4, I don't even having your hard time remembering why you like it.
4499.4,4500.4," Well, yeah."
4500.4,4501.4," No, it's interesting."
4501.4,4502.4," I mean, I had it."
4502.4,4503.4, It's funny.
4503.4,4507.4," I mean, I talked about this when we were offline when we were doing the voting, but"
4507.4,4512.4," bio shot started out very high on my top 10 and then as I kept working on it at my house,"
4512.4,4517.4," kept falling lower and, and I don't know why that is really, I don't know why."
4517.4,4518.4," I mean, it is on my top 10."
4518.4,4525.4," I do think it's one of the best games of the year, but where it fit in my hierarchy among the best fell."
4525.4,4529.4, And what are your best real quick?
4529.4,4536.4," What are your top two, you think, for your own, for me personally, portal and burning crusade?"
4536.4,4537.4, Okay.
4537.4,4541.4, That kind of blows my theory because I was going to suggest maybe does it?
4541.4,4546.4, I was going to ask maybe if it had something to do with the note that those games left you on.
4546.4,4551.4," But of course, burning crusade can't leave you on any note other than when you still fell asleep at your computer,"
4551.4,4553.4, when you want to go to your dish.
4553.4,4554.4, Yeah.
4554.4,4556.4," No, because it could be portal like Ryan."
4556.4,4560.4," When you ask people about portal all the song at the end, it's like, well, that's, that's not the game."
4560.4,4561.4, It's not the game.
4561.4,4562.4, It is.
4562.4,4563.4, It is.
4563.4,4566.4," But it's like, by our shock ended with some shitty CG."
4566.4,4567.4, Yeah.
4567.4,4572.4," You know, and depending on what's in it, you harvested any little sisters."
4572.4,4573.4, It ended on.
4573.4,4575.4, I did the supremely unsatisfactory.
4575.4,4576.4, I did the happy.
4576.4,4577.4, I did the happy.
4577.4,4578.4, I wanted to.
4578.4,4579.4, I was.
4579.4,4580.4, I was.
4580.4,4581.4, I was.
4581.4,4583.4, I was.
4583.4,4585.4, I was not bummed by the ending.
4585.4,4586.4, I was fine with the ending.
4586.4,4588.4, I think it was just.
4588.4,4591.4," It felt like a, it felt like a great experience to me."
4591.4,4593.4, I enjoyed it all the way through.
4593.4,4595.4, I didn't play anything else until I was done with it.
4595.4,4597.4, I was mesmerized at the time.
4597.4,4600.4, But then we're getting the one up yours.
4600.4,4602.4, I get the hell out there.
4602.4,4604.4, But I felt that it.
4604.4,4605.4, I wouldn't replay it now.
4605.4,4608.4, It felt very much like a one time thing to me.
4608.4,4611.4, It hasn't retained as well in my mind.
4611.4,4614.4," I don't, and I can't, I don't have a good articulate way, especially with garnet"
