211.0,213.0," Plus, extra special guest."
213.0,218.0, The coveted six chair has now been filled.
218.0,220.0, The searches over we have our six chair.
220.0,222.0, Stop posting about it.
222.0,223.0, It's all settled.
223.0,224.0, It's Robert Ashley.
224.0,225.0, Hello.
225.0,226.0, Podcasts.
226.0,227.0, Robert.

235.0,236.0, And the judge said.
236.0,238.0, We call him Bob Ludo.
238.0,241.0," No, you only Sean calls me Bob Ludo."
241.0,243.0," Well, continue to call you."
243.0,244.0, It's on the right.
244.0,245.0, We're not allowed to.
245.0,246.0, Who else is here?
246.0,247.0, Yeah.

253.0,257.0, And how many people here already have started playing Bioshack?
257.0,258.0, Me.
258.0,259.0, Me.
259.0,260.0, Just playing a demo a million times count.
260.0,261.0," Yeah, now."
261.0,263.0, So that's Sean Maloy and Robert Ashley.
263.0,265.0, The rest of us don't have it yet.
265.0,266.0, Lusers.
266.0,268.0," And yeah, I gave a copy of it."
268.0,270.0, He was very generous this weekend.
270.0,271.0, He had it.
271.0,272.0, He flaunted it.
272.0,273.0," And then I said, I want it."
273.0,274.0, But you're playing it on the 360.
274.0,275.0, Yes.
275.0,276.0," One, three, two, three, two."
276.0,277.0, You can get it.
277.0,278.0, You can see what you see.
278.0,279.0," I was like, I'm going to win."
279.0,280.0, It's coming out in a few days.
280.0,281.0, I could play it on PC or I could play it on 360.
281.0,282.0, This weekend.
282.0,283.0, And I played it on 360 this weekend.
283.0,284.0, And I played it on 360 this weekend.
284.0,285.0, But the PC demo came out today.
285.0,287.0, We're recording this on Monday.
287.0,288.0, And it's out.
288.0,290.0, But I don't think any of us got it yet.
290.0,292.0, It just went live as we came down to podcasts.
292.0,293.0, So yeah.
293.0,295.0, So we're going to check that out.
295.0,296.0, We've heard from people who played it though.
296.0,297.0, Yeah.
297.0,299.0," And what if they said, so we can report on their findings."
299.0,301.0, And just to follow us.
301.0,305.0," A few, you know, things that we kind of expected like,"
305.0,309.0, weapon and plasma switching is super rapid.
309.0,310.0, No no pause or anything.
310.0,317.0," And that way, you know, if you're going to combo web combo attacks and plasma powers and stuff to react quickly, it means that works well."
317.0,319.0, And another interesting thing.
319.0,327.0," The game already is you can tell, you know, from the 360 version, it's got like a huge suite of just general tweaking options and difficulty options."
327.0,332.0, Going to the extent that even the console version lets you choose a frame rate lock or not.
332.0,337.0," So if you want to play for consistent frame rate or you want to go for maybe looking a little better,"
337.0,340.0, but the frame rate's going to dip now and then.
340.0,343.0," And it also, this is this goes for all versions."
343.0,346.0, It allows you to mess with certain settings.
346.0,347.0, So you can turn off radar.
347.0,351.0, You can turn off the equivalent of tool tips and things like that.
351.0,365.0," But the PC version lets you turn off flashing objectives and stuff, which is really cool because we complain, well, I complain a lot about about games that increasingly play themselves by reminding you to jump or to duck all the time or telling you that,"
365.0,369.0," Hey, this big giant flashing doorway is probably something you want to go and press a key on or something."
369.0,389.0," And so for a game, I think it's important for a game like this that works that they've invested so much labor and thought and making, you know, an immersive atmosphere that if you don't want to, I mean, if you want to go the full extent of that, you know, and have it so that there are no sore thumbs so to speak in that environment, then you can turn that off."
389.0,391.0, And that's definitely how I plan on playing it.
391.0,405.0," It's interesting because it's kind of two layers to that if, because I've been playing it so like you got the big flashing switches, which I would want to turn off, but I would not want to turn off like the little hiccups all over the place because they're all over the place."
405.0,416.0," Players like wine bottles, you can pick up there's like cigarette package and they're if they weren't flashing, I don't think I'd see him because it's really dark game and they're like hidden in corner where they're flashing in the demo."
416.0,418.0, I don't remember the flashing in the demo.
418.0,421.0, Where that's really subtle. It's not like beating it over your head.
421.0,422.0," No, yeah."
422.0,428.0," I mean, it seems kind of like as you go close your towards something, you just kind of like, as a shimmer off it for a second."
428.0,435.0," Yeah, this, this is something that are a lot more pronounced, like more key items, but like those I definitely want to turn off."
435.0,438.0," If you can't turn them off in the console, where you cannot."
438.0,441.0," Well, the only thing that those that you're turning off."
441.0,444.0," Oh, okay. It's not that as far as I know, maybe it is."
444.0,452.0, All of that. I don't know if I would do the example that would be familiar and there's not spoiler territories when you start the demo and I've watched someone play the first segment of it.
452.0,457.0, When you enter the world of rapture and you're getting out of the.
457.0,464.0," Your tram right thing and you look on the wall. There's like a flashing control box that's like, you know, press this to open the door."
464.0,468.0," So that for example, would not be a glowing box. It would just be a box."
468.0,474.0," When you're stuck inside of the equivalent of a locked elevator, you would go and mess with the buttons and then it will."
474.0,476.0," Yeah, but yeah, that doesn't."
476.0,478.0," I, that doesn't seem like a clue that needed to be pointed out."
478.0,482.0," I mean, yeah, you're in like a very common room and there's one lever."
482.0,484.0," Well, fuck, I'll see you're going to there."
484.0,485.0, Some people are going to go.
485.0,486.0, That's there.
486.0,487.0, Mommy.
487.0,493.0," It is a door already between console and I mean, it's kind of like, sounds like PC's not a reward smarter."
493.0,501.0," But, but developers can you do and developers will, like constantly say, yes, we expect the other PC audience to be a little more hardcore."
501.0,508.0," And that just kind of goes to the territory. If you got a computer that's able to run these things and, you know, maintaining them and stuff like that,"
508.0,511.0, they figure maybe you're a little more hardcore about your games.
511.0,517.0," You know, in other words, it didn't just happen as an impulse by that you got, well, for most people that you got it in the 80 and the GTX."
517.0,518.0, I'm also sure.
518.0,521.0, I will say that there are a couple puzzles.
521.0,526.0, I won't spoil anything that would have been much more satisfying if the thing wasn't flashing.
526.0,527.0," Oh, yeah."
527.0,531.0," Like I was like, okay, if I knew kind of new, you could hinted last week."
531.0,533.0, This might be an option in the PC version.
533.0,534.0, We hadn't confirmed it yet.
534.0,541.0," So I was thinking when I was doing these particular puzzles like, if that wasn't flashing, I would have felt so bad as if I figured that out."
541.0,542.0, So are there actual puzzles then?
542.0,544.0," They're actually, I'm trying to figure out."
544.0,549.0," I can't think of anything that to me is a explicit puzzle in the game, not that I want you to tell."
549.0,551.0," Right, I know it's hard to ever."
551.0,555.0, But talk over everything seems pretty straightforward to me.
555.0,559.0," I wouldn't call it a puzzle, at least coming out from a console."
559.0,560.0, This was kind of a slide.
560.0,562.0, What about half-life?
562.0,563.0," Do you consider half-life, too?"
563.0,564.0, Is having puzzles?
564.0,570.0," Yeah, yeah, like, I mean, all the stuff for you using the gravity gun, the like, build your way up to it."
570.0,571.0," Right, right."
571.0,572.0, That's puzzle-edited.
572.0,573.0, So nothing like that.
573.0,574.0," I've shot, doesn't have that stuff."
574.0,576.0, There are a few things like that.
576.0,581.0," I mean, that I've run across, but maybe it's just that I haven't really been paying as careful attention."
581.0,582.0, Yeah.
582.0,583.0, That's actually interesting points.
583.0,586.0," I always find myself wondering, I mean, as gamers, I mean, are there just some conventions?"
586.0,588.0," It just, it kind of comes in great at this point."
588.0,590.0," We don't consider them puzzles, but technically they are."
590.0,592.0," It's just kind of one of those, like,"
592.0,596.0," Well, yeah, I mean, you've been trained enough at this point to know that, you know, you look for this key or you go to this switch."
596.0,599.0," We can fire-check this, you're now doing a puzzle."
599.0,600.0," Yeah, you're actually subtle."
600.0,605.0," The games that do that are like the survival horror games, especially sound like a pill."
605.0,607.0," It's not like, you know, it's not specifically a slide."
607.0,609.0," You go into a screen, and there is a puzzle on the screen."
609.0,612.0," The hacking mini-game, that's a lot of fun."
612.0,613.0, Mm-hmm.
613.0,614.0, Not forever.
614.0,623.0," But I actually surprised by the longevity of the hacking mini-game, especially when it adds a level of anxiety."
623.0,627.0," When you're in the middle of a battle and you're, you're going to face a bunch of bots or something,"
627.0,630.0, and you're trying to hack one and everything's chaos.
630.0,635.0," And then all of a sudden you go into this hack screen, and if you're not fast enough, you're going to get screwed."
635.0,636.0," Right, you're going to zap to whatever."
636.0,642.0," It is weird though to go from, like, the crazy battles of playing like pipe dream."
642.0,643.0," Yeah, totally."
643.0,645.0, What's I didn't realize that was in this game?
645.0,646.0, Oh yeah.
646.0,648.0, What's the damn Pop-Cap game?
648.0,649.0," Yeah, Rocket Mania."
649.0,651.0, It looks kind of like that.
651.0,653.0, You just connect a few uses or the pipes over.
653.0,656.0," Well, the cool thing about it is, like, if you do, like, when you get kind of sick of the,"
656.0,661.0," you know, you unlock an achievement that says you've now done 100 slide puzzles or whatever."
661.0,662.0," Like, oh, God."
662.0,665.0," But you can reach a point where you can just go, you know what?"
665.0,667.0, I'm just going to start blasting these things with my shotgun.
667.0,670.0," And you can totally, and option two, you can just, you can also just read a little."
670.0,671.0, It's really little.
671.0,672.0, It's just really little.
672.0,674.0," Like, you can, you can do that too."
674.0,677.0, That sounds all very oblivion like the whole lockpicking mechanism.
677.0,678.0, Yeah.
678.0,681.0," And then you can, you want, you can, you know, work on your lockpicking."
681.0,686.0," The thing that I did that to where, like, you'd have, you know, the lockpicking mini game,"
686.0,690.0," which was clearly just in another universe, or you're suddenly playing a mini game."
690.0,693.0," That is for a while, you just like, cool, cool, and then it's like, all right,"
693.0,695.0, and then to many of these now.
695.0,702.0," This is something that I was worried about with Bayoshaka's far as the similarity to Oblivion and all of the options that you have for customizing your stuff,"
702.0,708.0," because Oblivion is the kind of game that, like, really puts me to sleep, and I can't stand the game."
709.0,712.0," But I was like, by the time I was a game of the year last year."
712.0,713.0, Yeah.
713.0,717.0," It was like, to be like playing a living board game."
717.0,719.0," Like, there's nothing and grossing about it."
719.0,720.0, There's nothing and grossing.
720.0,721.0, You didn't even have fun.
721.0,722.0, Just wandering around the environment.
722.0,723.0, Pick it up.
723.0,724.0, Is that special?
724.0,726.0," You don't, it doesn't have a world."
726.0,727.0, It doesn't feel like you're there.
727.0,732.0," It feels like completely, like, you're a role player in the woods,"
732.0,734.0, larking or something.
734.0,735.0, Yeah.
735.0,737.0, That's so.
737.0,738.0, Yeah.
738.0,739.0, It's such the opposite.
739.0,749.0," Like, when I played it, I mean, and we all made such a big deal and everyone continually talks about that grand moment when you exit the dungeon sewers and you look at this grand world that's there for you to explore."
749.0,750.0," But like, just a fun."
750.0,755.0," You're walking around in the mountains and a borgo's run in by and, I mean, like, I don't know."
755.0,757.0, I felt like I was up in that place.
757.0,763.0," It just, your physical connection with the world was so, like, the way your guy moves, the way his people."
763.0,764.0," She's like, in third person."
764.0,765.0, No.
765.0,766.0, Right.
766.0,767.0, Yeah.
767.0,772.0," But if you do, you can see the representation of what you feel at the first."
772.0,775.0," I mean, you can see the combat was a bit underrated."
775.0,776.0, Yeah.
776.0,778.0," But anyway, not to knock the game that everyone loves."
778.0,784.0," But by our show, because a little lot more, in grossing, and it feels a lot more like a place."
784.0,785.0, Yeah.
785.0,786.0, It's also more contained.
786.0,794.0," And I think actually going off with you, we were talking about this just before the podcast, but like, what I think is really interesting is how this is a game that's reaching out to people that wouldn't even care about the genre in the first place."
794.0,798.0," Last week Ryan recently, we didn't care about first person shooters."
798.0,801.0," My wife Amy, she doesn't play games at all."
801.0,805.0," And yet, as I was testing out the demo this weekend, she just kept, like, she stopped what she was doing."
805.0,808.0," She was watching me play and she actually, like, wanted me to keep playing."
808.0,810.0," It got to the point, like, I was like, a crap."
810.0,811.0, I'm doing this for too long.
811.0,812.0," She's like, I want to play it again."
812.0,813.0, Because of the look of it.
813.0,815.0," But it looks like it's a deal, the vibe."
815.0,817.0," I mean, like, she really got into it."
817.0,818.0, The whole experience.
818.0,819.0, Wouldn't she play it herself?
819.0,820.0, No.
820.0,821.0, No.
821.0,822.0," Actually, that's the funny part."
822.0,823.0, She did not want to play herself.
823.0,824.0, She wanted to watch me play.
824.0,825.0, Mm-hmm.
825.0,827.0, I think it was a so odd ball.
827.0,830.0, What did she think it was hard to watch?
830.0,832.0, She liked to watch.
832.0,833.0, She likes to watch.
833.0,834.0, She likes to watch.
834.0,835.0, She'll that splice her.
835.0,836.0, It's a big daddy over here.
836.0,837.0," Oh, yeah."
837.0,840.0, She's a cool looking game.
840.0,845.0," I mean, that's how in the very first segment that I talked about again, because that's how much"
845.0,850.0," I didn't want to spoil the experience where, like, I watched Rhino Donald game videos and"
850.0,853.0, one-up show play two minutes of it.
853.0,856.0," Basically, just set foot inside the roller raster."
856.0,860.0," And by the time you got in there on the little trim right, I was like, there's more"
860.0,865.0, labor and thought put into this minute than I saw you.
865.0,866.0, Yeah.
866.0,871.0," As far as atmosphere goes, then I see in a whole lot of games and in higher levels and"
871.0,874.0," Halo and a lot of, you know, nuts and the, I guess, the names."
874.0,877.0," But just, you know, when you think of like various, you know, yeah,"
877.0,881.0," EA games, the franchises that come very Southern frances that come out on a yearly basis."
881.0,883.0," I mean, you look at yours and, and so you really get it."
883.0,884.0, Hard director.
884.0,885.0, Yeah.
885.0,888.0," They really thought of, I mean, every poster on the wall."
888.0,889.0, Right.
889.0,890.0," Yeah, just right."
890.0,891.0, Right.
891.0,892.0, And you progress through it.
892.0,894.0," Again, trying to avoid spoil the theory."
894.0,898.0," Like, if you're worried like that you're going to just be seeing the same thing over and over again,"
898.0,899.0, you're not.
899.0,900.0, Because it's so much very cool.
900.0,902.0," I mean, it's all hangs together in the same, you know,"
902.0,903.0, art.
903.0,909.0," And you're wondering this industrialized city thing, but like certain areas have a very clear stamp on them and you're walking through you're like,"
909.0,911.0," Okay, this is really fucked up."
911.0,912.0, Yeah.
912.0,914.0, And it's totally different way than the last area was fucked up.
914.0,916.0, And that's what I love the structure.
916.0,921.0," The game is sort of like a, I've always like, games that that unfold as detectives stories,"
921.0,925.0," where instead of being told a story or going around finding artifacts from the world,"
925.0,928.0, learning about what happened there that sort of thing.
928.0,930.0, But it's usually kind of clunky and biotr.
930.0,933.0, I feel like it's on the level of almost it's not a detective story.
933.0,938.0, It's like you're an anthropologist and you're going down to this weird culture and finding all the different parts of it.
938.0,943.0," And, you know, seeing all these different, like, sub cultures inside of everything on the walls,"
943.0,945.0," everything that's going on is really, really."
945.0,948.0," Yeah, so it's still sub cultures that kind of unravel themselves."
948.0,951.0," Yeah, using the art to tell, like, pretty, but exactly what you're saying,"
951.0,954.0," using the art to tell a story and to contain, you know,"
954.0,956.0, contain the game's own history.
956.0,959.0, So to speak within the way it's put together rather than having a story.
959.0,961.0, And other than having to pick up a document.
961.0,962.0," Well, yes, there."
962.0,967.0," Well, here's one thing that fire shock does, which is one of those suspension of disbelief thing,"
967.0,970.0," which I have no problem doing just because it's hanging together so well,"
970.0,974.0," but all over the place, there are these little,"
974.0,976.0, paper quarters you pick up.
976.0,978.0," I think there's some in the demo, but they're everywhere."
978.0,979.0," And like, you know,"
979.0,981.0," as soon as you start thinking about it, you're just like,"
981.0,986.0," right, why is the leader of rapture leaving his audio diaries on and bar tables?"
986.0,987.0, So you go way too shocked.
987.0,988.0, Is that too?
988.0,990.0," Also, but it's over when I get place."
990.0,995.0," Just here again, you know, all the stories told through people's answering machines on their found."
995.0,998.0," And then, you just noticed it for like a half second, everyone's in a while,"
998.0,1000.0," where you're just like, oh, wait a minute."
1000.0,1002.0," But then some of the, some of the, back to it."
1002.0,1005.0," Is the early intro Ryan podcast, I guess."
1005.0,1008.0," Yeah, it's a great, to me, it's a great way to tell a story because like,"
1008.0,1013.0," you'll trigger these audio diaries and then you're totally free to keep moving along while you're at least with audio, right?"
1013.0,1014.0," Yeah, you're not sitting there."
1014.0,1015.0, You can even go into your menus.
1015.0,1016.0, It never pauses.
1016.0,1019.0," You can just like listen to this and go, oh, cool, while you're fighting or whatever."
1019.0,1024.0, That's because some of the tapes are really well done and really disturbing.
1024.0,1025.0," Is a few, yeah."
1025.0,1030.0," So there's a few that are their own reward too, because like sometimes you'll enter a room and,"
1030.0,1033.0," you know, often time you're looking for loot."
1033.0,1035.0, Sometimes the room itself is the reward.
1035.0,1037.0," You're just like, look at the room and just go, oh my god."
1037.0,1040.0," Okay, I have to, that one's stained into my memory."
1040.0,1042.0," Like, like, like a silent hill kind of game did that too,"
1042.0,1047.0," where you've walk into a room and there just be nothing in there, except something really fucked up to look at."
1047.0,1048.0, I have a few times.
1048.0,1050.0, But I've spent like minutes looking at stuff like that.
1050.0,1052.0, I swear to talk about this not being able to say something.
1052.0,1056.0," I know, yeah, I think if I can get it going on on it, like,"
1056.0,1058.0," well, since it is a bitch to talk about without spoilers,"
1058.0,1061.0," but there are general questions from people like me who haven't played it,"
1061.0,1066.0, then I think you can answer without going into sighting specific examples and evidence.
1066.0,1068.0," And one, you've kind of answered it and that's, you know,"
1068.0,1071.0," thinking, you have this really rigid environment, well, hypothetically,"
1071.0,1075.0," and that it's underwatt, you know, you're in an undersea world."
1075.0,1076.0, Right.
1076.0,1082.0," So it's, you know, offhand, it doesn't give you the, you wouldn't assume it would give you the range that you would have in half life to setting,"
1082.0,1086.0, where you're going from cities and prisons and beaches and all this stuff.
1086.0,1089.0, So they find ways to keep that very.
1089.0,1090.0, Yes.
1090.0,1093.0," I mean, it's always a never breaks character, like what you see at the beginning."
1093.0,1095.0, It's kind of variations on the theme.
1096.0,1104.0," But, but they're big enough that, like, you feel like you're in a different place and each area has, like, a very distinct character to it."
1104.0,1105.0, Yeah.
1105.0,1107.0," I mean, they really feel like they're like the underwater utopia."
1107.0,1110.0," And if you imagine, like, if you had the live in an underwater bubble,"
1110.0,1116.0," you would want a lot of variety in that and they try to bring all the experiences of, like, a big city life"
1116.0,1118.0," and to, you know, the underwater city."
1118.0,1124.0," So there's, there's a lot of variation, but, uh, the really empty, busy kill and stuff."
1124.0,1128.0," And the other thing that really made half life to such a standout game for me is, like, of course, the characters."
1128.0,1132.0," I mean, like, like, one of the few shooters, if not the only shooter where if someone starts talking,"
1132.0,1135.0," I'll actually stop to listen to what they're saying rather than just like trying to,"
1135.0,1139.0, you bunny hop around the door until it opens and lets me fuck out.
1139.0,1144.0," Um, so in this game, what I'm wondering is, I'm just, I'm used to seeing all the screenshots."
1144.0,1148.0," Half of it looks like a rogue's gallery from Dick Tracy or something, you know, like,"
1148.0,1155.0," the race has their more to it than that are the characters that you can empathize with or that are interesting or as it just, like,"
1155.0,1160.0," pretty much, you know, like a David Lynch, surreal scene."
1160.0,1163.0," One just, I wonder if you're seeing our strictly pretty much enemies."
1163.0,1169.0," Um, although they go to a certain length to make the enemies characters in some ways, like, you'll walk in."
1169.0,1175.0," Like, if you played the demo, there's the scene in the demo of, of the couple, it's a domestic situation and,"
1175.0,1179.0," and they're arguing about how to spend their Adam, the genetic material stuff."
1179.0,1184.0, And it's like this weird moment where you get insight into what it's like to live down there.
1184.0,1186.0," I mean, the real people, they just want to kill you."
1186.0,1188.0, Right.
1188.0,1193.0," You know, going on with their, yeah, there's some of my normal things like killing people or taking care of them."
1193.0,1194.0, I'm getting mad at them.
1194.0,1198.0," I'm going to make sure you're like, like, a guildor from the Masters at the universe movie though."
1198.0,1199.0, Yeah.
1199.0,1200.0, Yeah.
1200.0,1204.0," They are, they are not pretty looking, but they all look like the Joker or something."
1204.0,1212.0," But they do to a certain extent, like, keep the enemies feeling more like characters than just nameless Nazi types."
1212.0,1218.0," And then there are main players in the, in the, in the story that you're always kind of removed from."
1218.0,1220.0," Oh, there are, like, the operators."
1220.0,1221.0, Yeah.
1221.0,1222.0, Yeah.
1222.0,1223.0, It's interesting.
1223.0,1224.0," Again, hard to do this."
1224.0,1225.0, All right.
1225.0,1226.0, I don't know.
1226.0,1231.0," So what one of my questions not related to the content is just a kind of general, like, the hype for this game at this point is like,"
1231.0,1232.0, it's fairly overwhelming.
1232.0,1233.0, It is.
1233.0,1234.0, Everybody's giving it tens.
1234.0,1241.0, The message boards are at a control and has that amount of hype so far at all dampened your experience.
1241.0,1245.0," Like, are we headed for the, the Bioshock backlash now?"
1245.0,1246.0, I wasn't that good.
1246.0,1247.0, Maybe.
1247.0,1249.0, I wanted to play it every three minutes.
1249.0,1250.0, I had this weekend.
1250.0,1251.0, I like which you know.
1251.0,1253.0, I think it's a very great sign.
1253.0,1254.0," It's, it's great."
1254.0,1260.0," I think, he always has the potential to be damaging because one problem I have personally is that I,"
1260.0,1265.0, I feel like I knew too much and I didn't even know that much going into it.
1265.0,1267.0," I wish I, I don't know nothing."
1267.0,1273.0," I think we're looking out in that, and in that all the things that people read about the game are usually,"
1273.0,1274.0, I don't know.
1274.0,1279.0," It's a hard game to describe and, and we're not particularly good at describing games."
1279.0,1286.0," You know, maybe not people in this room, but, you know, a lot of stuff that people read about by a Shocks,"
1286.0,1289.0, pretty vague and it's hard to tell what the experience is likely to actually play it.
1289.0,1290.0, Yeah.
1290.0,1291.0, And there's a lot of the variety to say.
1291.0,1292.0, I did.
1292.0,1293.0, Oh my God.
1293.0,1294.0, Yeah.
1294.0,1296.0, I didn't really understand it until I played it.
1296.0,1298.0," And I think it's, I don't know."
1298.0,1303.0," I don't think it games in terms of score, but it's the most fun I've had in a year to."
1303.0,1304.0, Yeah.
1304.0,1308.0," So if you know as a smash, yeah, like when you play it, if like what you said, I mean, you, you"
1308.0,1309.0, want to keep playing.
1309.0,1312.0," And then when you quit playing, you're thinking about what you just played."
1312.0,1313.0, Yeah.
1313.0,1314.0, Very much.
1314.0,1315.0, I was thinking about it on the bottom.
1315.0,1316.0," It was like, okay."
1317.0,1321.0," Things I had seen into some sort of like, well, again, I don't know what to say."
1321.0,1322.0, Never.
1322.0,1323.0," Well, I mean, you do think about it."
1323.0,1324.0, It sticks with you.
1324.0,1327.0, It's definitely the game that everybody on this floor is talking about.
1327.0,1328.0, Like just walking down here.
1328.0,1333.0, Everyone not gaming to have like three people to solve separately talking about the game.
1333.0,1335.0, And some people are walking spoilers.
1335.0,1336.0, That's how it is.
1336.0,1337.0, Yeah.
1337.0,1339.0, I don't want to name names fucking David Ellis.
1339.0,1340.0, That's a little shut up.
1340.0,1341.0, I haven't played a game.
1341.0,1343.0, Cover my ears all the way to the left.
1343.0,1345.0," If we're, if we're in a move on, a little bit,"
1345.0,1346.0, it's a natural.
1346.0,1347.0, Yeah.
1347.0,1348.0, Yeah.
1348.0,1353.0, So I was up in Seattle recently and I got to visit Valve and play quite a bit.
1353.0,1355.0, I got to jump around and play various levels.
1355.0,1359.0, Talk about weight of spoiled stuff to jump around and play various levels of episode two.
1359.0,1360.0, And then also team fortress two.
1360.0,1364.0, But the thing with that is like my whole flight back.
1364.0,1367.0," Well, basically I was there with Rhino Donald again."
1367.0,1370.0," And as soon as we left Valve, we were like,"
1370.0,1371.0," ah, dude, that was fun."
1371.0,1373.0, Don't you wish we were taking that home with us.
1373.0,1374.0," And like, you know, the whole flight back."
1374.0,1377.0, I was thinking about how I was playing and just some of the stuff there.
1377.0,1379.0, Both games are both games.
1379.0,1380.0, Yeah.
1380.0,1385.0," And then yeah, and then someone asked me, well, which one get a pick one that you want to play most right now, which one is it?"
1385.0,1388.0," It was like kind of hard to say, because I do."
1388.0,1392.0, I had to admit like I really want to play Half Life 2 episode two.
1392.0,1393.0, Right.
1393.0,1395.0, I'm still counted episode two.
1395.0,1396.0, Yeah.
1396.0,1397.0, That's what's called.
1397.0,1398.0, Okay.
1398.0,1399.0," So, well, do you have episode one out?"
1399.0,1400.0, What are you going to call it?
1400.0,1401.0, Yeah.
1401.0,1402.0, That's too late.
1402.0,1403.0, I guess.
1403.0,1404.0, Yeah.
1404.0,1408.0," So, the thing about that is it answers all the questions."
1408.0,1412.0," Well, it seems like it's promising to answer a number of the questions that I had."
1412.0,1416.0, And that I wanted to see resolved after I played Half Life 2.
1416.0,1419.0, Those were like stuff about antline ecology.
1419.0,1420.0," You know, where do they live?"
1420.0,1422.0," You know, are there other like cast of them?"
1422.0,1423.0, Totally geeked out stuff.
1423.0,1426.0," But like again, that's testament to how cool that game was."
1426.0,1428.0, Where I want to know like what other.
1428.0,1431.0, What the monsters do when they're underground and shit.
1431.0,1432.0, They're underground and shit.
1432.0,1433.0, They're underground and shit.
1433.0,1434.0, They're underground and shit.
1434.0,1435.0, They're underground and shit.
1435.0,1436.0, They're underground and shit.
1436.0,1438.0," So, you go all through their environment."
1438.0,1440.0, That's there.
1440.0,1448.0, Issues with the Vortagons in the way that their their allegiance has changed between Half Life 1 and 2 and what they're up to and just their sort of role in the greater Half Life universe.
1448.0,1451.0, They get into that.
1451.0,1454.0, Just coming back to developing the characters that you're used to seeing.
1454.0,1457.0, Some of the questions that they set up in episode 1.
1457.0,1460.0, Spoiler for if you're a console only listener and you haven't played episode 1.
1460.0,1464.0, The advisors that won't really tell you anything you don't know what that is.
1464.0,1469.0, But they definitely make an appearance and you interact with them and the looming questions.
1469.0,1473.0," They won't, I don't know if it's answered not, but it's possibility is Dr."
1473.0,1474.0, Brain now an advisor.
1474.0,1486.0, Dr. Brain of course is the very esteemed doctor from Half Life 2 and who sort of like cut a deal with the devil with the combine who are the aliens that invaded and invaded the planet.
1486.0,1491.0, And then he apparently dies in the the mega.
1491.0,1503.0," What is it the sort of like meltdown that occurs at the end of Half Life 2, but there's this possibility and it's kind of hinted at or it's either that or it's just kind of like rampant internet bullshit speculation."
1503.0,1511.0, But that somehow he was able to become his you know his mind or something with somehow transfer to the bloating sack of shit known as the advisor.
1511.0,1513.0, So all that stuff there.
1514.0,1516.0, I don't remember any of this.
1516.0,1520.0," I'm like, do you realize you just open the door for us to talk about the world of warcraft and law for everything."
1520.0,1521.0," Yeah, God damn it."
1521.0,1524.0," Hey, you guys do the all the time to give me a lot of the law."
1524.0,1526.0, So the first to come up in the next.
1526.0,1536.0," Next, most, most to be the game picks up a, it picks up the second half life episode 1 ends, which is you know that if you played it and goes straight from there."
1536.0,1538.0, There's definitely some big events.
1539.0,1545.0, Now I'm like finding myself in the same position of like would what I say without giving details. So hit me up with any questions if you got him.
1545.0,1548.0, So what did all that stuff that you just said mean.
1548.0,1550.0, That I like.
1550.0,1553.0, You said like just gave enough to care about the story.
1553.0,1555.0," Yeah, and more agrabony gun."
1555.0,1557.0," And again, the gravity guns in there."
1557.0,1565.0," But so get, you know, one of the first, and one of the first levels I jumped into your read your with Alex again, you're talking to her father or some of the other characters,"
1565.0,1566.0, and that's been in the world.
1566.0,1571.0," But that was really interesting. Like I said, you know, where it a lot of games when someone starts talking, it's like, okay, let me out the door."
1571.0,1574.0," As soon as they were there, you're like, okay, this is, this is cool."
1574.0,1577.0," Like I know, I feel like that that's a character."
1577.0,1585.0," I mean, I don't feel like it's a real person, but I feel like it's at least, I could, I feel fine calling them characters and not just whatever you have in most shooters."
1585.0,1588.0, They have excelled at that going all the way back to Half Life 1.
1588.0,1589.0, They have it.
1589.0,1592.0," I mean, I remember I was just walking up to the different scientists way back in the first game."
1592.0,1595.0, And having that be such a novel experience that they talked.
1595.0,1600.0," They got talked that you weren't just shooting them, that they thought that they looked at you, that they responded to them."
1600.0,1602.0, And they've really been building on that.
1602.0,1612.0," You know, I mean, like Alex now, not only, you know, she was good in episode one, but she, she has an even greater, you know, a variety of reactions and stuff if you're driving hot."
1612.0,1614.0," And she, of course, she always looks hot."
1614.0,1617.0," You're driving, she comments on, you know, on the way you're driving."
1617.0,1621.0," If you're hitting things, running things over, you know, what she's fighting now."
1621.0,1628.0, She's moving around and fought blind firing and just doing it just behaving in a way where she seems scared at times.
1628.0,1633.0," She seems confident, but just that perfect mix where she's not bitching at you and telling you like, you've got to rescue me."
1633.0,1634.0, You've got to rescue me.
1634.0,1635.0, You've got to rescue me.
1635.0,1640.0," Kind of like, you know, the heroines and the extra characters that they throw in a resin, he will some stuff."
1640.0,1647.0," And, and there's this really cool moment to, just to, yeah, it's not really."
1648.0,1658.0," The fans are just, but you're basically, you're fighting with the board of, with one of the board of gods who, you know, you know, that you fight with these guys now and they've got all these attacks that they do."
1658.0,1665.0," And Alex is with you, eventually dog comes along and it's kind of like the half-life version of the Avengers or something."
1665.0,1670.0," Instead of, because of the loneliness and isolation that characterizes so much of half-life too."
1670.0,1675.0," Yeah, and it's like, you look around and you're like, I got all my friends here."
1675.0,1676.0, Fucking shit up.
1676.0,1678.0," You're really, you're really, it's pretty cool."
1678.0,1679.0, That's a cool thing.
1679.0,1686.0," I loved, you know, I didn't play half-life too until like four months ago or so because I'm kind of like an under-privileged console gamer from way back."
1686.0,1690.0, But I finally got a computer that could play something as cutting edge as half-life too.
1690.0,1697.0," And, and I played it and it really like blew my mind kind of, it was especially all the character interactions stuff."
1697.0,1704.0," And the way that all that worked and I loved those moments between the battles read, end up in a place with other people and you'd be like,"
1704.0,1709.0," wow, you know, it really felt like you were alone a lot and then you would meet these people."
1709.0,1710.0, It was really a real relief.
1710.0,1713.0, It didn't ever bother you that you weren't talking.
1713.0,1715.0," No, I never had that moment."
1715.0,1717.0, I don't like speech and first person.
1717.0,1718.0, It feels weird.
1718.0,1719.0," And third person, I think it's okay."
1719.0,1721.0, It's always that contrast that matters.
1721.0,1725.0," I mean, it's like, you appreciate the other characters because you've been alone for a long time."
1725.0,1728.0," And this goes for a lot of games, but some developers just miss it, you know?"
1728.0,1730.0, I think it's really important in horror games.
1731.0,1738.0," You know, thinking about condemned, condemned to's coming out, you know, the Silent Hill, the Last of my Played."
1738.0,1743.0," You spend so much time in just these rady filthy disgusting places, you know, where it's just rhyme and everything."
1743.0,1750.0," And you really long for, like give me just a glimpse of the fucking sun now and then, like let me just know that there's a regular world somewhere."
1750.0,1753.0," And actually, you know, did you play it sound like how far the room?"
1753.0,1755.0, I assume you remember back when I was at E.G.
1755.0,1758.0, I played a little bit at the beginning.
1758.0,1759.0," Like, you're doing anything."
1759.0,1766.0," The cool thing about this, they got it there too in the contrast and it's like, okay, we're going to continue to dump you into this, these shit holes."
1766.0,1769.0, Let's give you one space in the world and that's your own apartment.
1769.0,1770.0, And it will be normal.
1770.0,1771.0, You can look out the window.
1771.0,1775.0," You see the world is used to it, but your doors locked and chained in."
1775.0,1778.0, There's this whole in the closet that leads you to hell.
1778.0,1781.0, And then you could peek through the wall.
1781.0,1783.0," But what happens is, eventually, they take that away from you."
1783.0,1787.0," What they give you that, it eventually, then the corruption starts taking over."
1787.0,1790.0," That room, which then you really miss it."
1790.0,1794.0, And then it gets to the point where you try to look at the window and it just has like covered up with crack.
1794.0,1795.0, I felt the same exactly.
1795.0,1802.0," But it was such a great piece of like, oh, I mean, it was for for a game and just for, you know, just for playing with your emotions and stuff."
1802.0,1807.0," They got the contrast there and to take it back to half life, I think they totally get that."
1807.0,1812.0, And that's one reason why you care about being with people is it's just because you don't overdo it.
1812.0,1814.0," You know, dog is such a cool."
1815.0,1824.0," Introduction at Half Life 2 and you play with them in this scene as you do, then you're separated from them and you meet up with them again and you're like, oh yeah, that guy was, you're like, that guy is so cool."
1824.0,1831.0," I want to be read to do all the stuff with them and he's like, he's gone and then you're like, you want to see him again and he comes back and you're like, hey dog, you know, I mean that's pretty cool."
1831.0,1839.0," Well, to me, it's it's that it's the interaction with the other people, but it's also maybe the bigger picture to me is it's the pacing."
1839.0,1849.0," Yeah, it's a valve is always so genius about constantly switching up what you're doing, you know, it's like a basically like a giant roller coaster."
1849.0,1851.0, It's really like a rail shooter in a way.
1851.0,1857.0," They're the same guiding you along for beginning to end, we're all going to pretty much have almost the exact same experience."
1857.0,1867.0," But within that same experience, like every single area is something, you know, right at the point where you're sick of shooting things and they give you a whole puzzle sequence."
1867.0,1877.0," You're tired of being alone and then you get together with a group of people, avoiding combat fatigue, they call it, you know, where if this moment's been super intense for too long, then it's time to let you wind down."
1877.0,1878.0, Right.
1878.0,1882.0," And look at something at the sphere, one of those areas where you're talking about where you just like to look."
1882.0,1895.0," And then just yeah, just the variety, if you think of the difference between Raven home and the canals and the beach and inside the city delimine, there's just such a great variety of an inside city, some team of environments and places."
1895.0,1897.0," And right, they know that."
1897.0,1903.0," This time you're talking about it being a traditionally it's being like a rail ride, you know, a roller coaster."
1903.0,1910.0," One thing that I also wanted, you know what I was saying, I wanted them to explore antelindicology and stuff is to just like take it off the rail or to widen the rails a bit."
1910.0,1912.0, And they're definitely doing that now.
1912.0,1920.0," I mean, it's only ever a question of how far apart the rails are not if they're gone all together, but they're definitely have expanded that."
1920.0,1935.0, And they're having a lot of time to have options and they're hinting it now for the first time with the with the few small exceptions that you can do a little bit of exploring and half life and and sort of be rewarded for it with like just narrative stuff or something there.
1935.0,1936.0," I mean, they're really cagey about it."
1936.0,1944.0," It was kind of like we could tell you our line of questioning was going in the right direction because all of a sudden they said, okay, I could tell you that yeah, you definitely figure something out."
1944.0,1954.0," But so you know, it's wanting extra maybe if you are one example and half life too that's there's like there's this hidden cave and there's a board of gone in it and you go in there and he has a few things to say."
1954.0,1964.0," So I'm guessing along those lines, you know, you just kind of go out looking around and maybe you find something or some kind of again, it's natural part of the environment that tells you something."
1964.0,1968.0, And I wasn't saying that like being on the rails is a bad thing at all.
1968.0,1976.0," I mean, I think that can be the difference between like the experience that Robert had say with that game versus oblivion, right?"
1976.0,1986.0," If you take the rails off completely, I mean, really, you know, I was one of the people who voted for that being game in the year myself, but like that was probably my biggest problem with it in a way."
1986.0,1993.0," You take the rails off completely and it's not enough focus or guidance, you can get kind of lost."
1993.0,1994.0, Right.
1994.0,1997.0, That game is like a strength is that you don't have to follow the story at all.
1997.0,1998.0, Yeah.
1998.0,2001.0, Like also a major weakness if you're a big story freak.
2001.0,2002.0, Right.
2002.0,2004.0," I mean, but they don't force it on you, but in the hands of a big story."
2004.0,2011.0," You can get a little more if you want to stop and zoom in on the little scraps of paper on the walls and stuff, you know, I don't know if the resolution on the Xbox."
2011.0,2012.0, And you played on PC.
2012.0,2013.0, What?
2013.0,2014.0, What?
2014.0,2018.0," It's about the Xbox version, the original version that had lower res textures and stuff, but."
2018.0,2021.0," Yeah, you just played half life to you or not."
2021.0,2022.0, Yeah.
2022.0,2023.0, Yeah.
2023.0,2026.0, So a few other points for we move on to team board just to stuff.
2026.0,2032.0," So the GMands back, they explained a lot of his motivations and what he's doing."
2032.0,2034.0," And again, some big developments."
2034.0,2040.0," And then for the console people really look out on this because I mean, they get half life to."
2040.0,2049.0," Half life to now with HDR lighting and all this stuff, there's some new character models because they saw you know when they're giving the board a lot such a big role in having them on screen."
2049.0,2051.0, That's so much they say they don't look quite up to specs.
2051.0,2057.0, So they read it though as in all these others with new font shading and various effects that they've been working and introducing.
2057.0,2061.0," It is steam as they've been developing, you know, team portraits too and stuff."
2061.0,2064.0, So that's all there again episode one.
2064.0,2066.0, And they include lost those to that as well.
2066.0,2070.0," I don't think so, but they might as well."
2070.0,2073.0, So it seems they're a fun shading.
2073.0,2074.0, Fun shading.
2074.0,2075.0," Yeah, totally did."
2075.0,2077.0, And what is fun shading?
2077.0,2082.0," Don't ask me, you're exploring that, I mean, you're going to expose the lack of a clothing."
2082.0,2084.0, I used to play.
2084.0,2086.0, I don't know specifically how to break it down.
2086.0,2091.0," I know it has it to magic with smoothing like surfaces and I mean, and shading."
2091.0,2093.0, It's a texturing effect.
2093.0,2094.0, It's the magic.
2094.0,2098.0, I saw I saw a before and after picture of the team portraits pyro with and without it.
2098.0,2102.0, And I know you looked a lot better with it.
2102.0,2104.0," I don't know what it does, but I know it works well."
2104.0,2108.0," Okay, they haven't decided if they're going to update every, you know, PC version of the game."
2108.0,2116.0," It sounds like a no-brainer and they seem to think so too, but the question is just how to do it because they don't want to force an auto update on someone when it's like six gigs, you know."
2116.0,2120.0, So it's just going to be a question of maybe there's a window.
2120.0,2130.0, It's like click this if you've already have half like two and you want to upgrade now to the HDR one that's got the new character models and some of the stuff like that in it.
2130.0,2134.0," It's got, you know, it's twice as long is episode one."
2134.0,2136.0, It's got commentary again.
2136.0,2138.0, Got twice the commentary of course.
2138.0,2140.0, Commentary was great last time.
2140.0,2144.0, I never actually thought I would listen to game commentary.
2144.0,2149.0," Even in the way we're talking, that commentary is informed the way we think about shooters."
2149.0,2151.0," Not just their game, but shooters in general."
2151.0,2157.0," Some of the stuff that you were talking about about the pacing and about, you know, I used the term combat fatigue."
2157.0,2159.0," I mean, those come from their commentary."
2159.0,2163.0, Did anyone want to hear a check out the commentary in the Riddick?
2163.0,2164.0, No.
2164.0,2165.0, Back when I did.
2165.0,2167.0, That was the first one that did it.
2167.0,2168.0, That was cool.
2168.0,2169.0, It was cool.
2169.0,2170.0, It wasn't quite as good.
2170.0,2171.0," Yeah, I can imagine."
2171.0,2175.0, Team Fortress 2's also got commentary to jump on over to that.
2175.0,2179.0, And the way that works is you just load up.
2179.0,2185.0," Instead of making a game, a general game that people join in, you just make it and commentary mode."
2185.0,2187.0, And you just run around and you look at the notes and stuff.
2187.0,2191.0," The cool thing about that is that all that's, you know,"
2191.0,2194.0," the, the, what is it, the SDK and stuff."
2194.0,2204.0," So if you're a clan and you say, hey, we, you know, we need to find ways to tell new people who start playing about the strategic importance of this."
2204.0,2207.0, The best place is to put S G centry guns.
2207.0,2212.0," Anything like that, they can go in and do that with their own voices and just put those notes in."
2212.0,2219.0," Valve 2 said that it's a possibility that after, you know, a certain amount of time goes by and various ways of play emerge."
2219.0,2224.0," You know, where it's just kind of like a given that's like the price of entry is to know that you don't put your S G over here."
2224.0,2226.0, Because it's just going to get jacked immediately.
2226.0,2231.0, But then it's like actually really effective here that they could go in and do that to update it.
2231.0,2236.0," Um, a lot of potential there and then here's a nice little treat."
2236.0,2243.0," They, um, they, not 100% trying to figure the way to word this right without getting in trouble."
2243.0,2252.0," Just, it's likely that we'll be seeing a public beta for team fortress 2 in the future and be excited about that."
2252.0,2254.0, Wow.
2254.0,2255.0, Confirmed.
2255.0,2256.0, Yeah.
2256.0,2257.0, You have to be ready to confirm.
2257.0,2258.0, I'm going to make a first group.
2258.0,2259.0, Why beta.
2259.0,2261.0," Uh, tomorrow tomorrow."
2261.0,2262.0, Tomorrow.
2262.0,2263.0, Tomorrow.
2263.0,2264.0, Make it up.
2264.0,2270.0," So, um, team fortress 2 is was really interesting because I'd be first off you look at it."
2270.0,2271.0," And it's, it's awesome."
2271.0,2272.0, It just looks so cool.
2272.0,2273.0, It's still looking good as it had.
2273.0,2274.0, It does.
2274.0,2276.0," It looks a little, it looks a little better than thing."
2276.0,2277.0, Yeah.
2277.0,2281.0," Because when you see it in motion, I mean, even even this, this, this tiny as details like when"
2281.0,2286.0," you build an ammunition dispenser, something as an engineer."
2286.0,2300.0," And before they would just peer into the game world, now they sort of gradually form and they have the vibe of like a 1950s, you know, gas pump and then like, you know, a belt of ammunition, a belt of bullets, we're kind of like feed out the side and slip down the side of it on one end."
2300.0,2310.0," Then there's like a little health squirter pump on the on the other end that's like kind of working it's stuff and even, you know, the teleporters are spinning and operating and gears and stuff moving around the characters."
2310.0,2314.0," You have three, you have a different taunt depending on each weapon you have."
2314.0,2324.0," And it's during these really elaborate cartoon, I mean, just super animated things that you can do, you know, slap in your ass and just whatever other kind of nonsense you want to pull off."
2324.0,2327.0," We've got taunts and well, the warcraft."
2327.0,2329.0," I know you do, they don't think this is good."
2329.0,2330.0," Is this, I say we like that."
2330.0,2333.0," We make their natural, that's your nation."
2333.0,2334.0, Yeah.
2334.0,2337.0," I call mine from world to worldcraft, where we have taunts."
2337.0,2343.0," And as are off, even like this is tech, even like the spy, you know, you can change costumes if you didn't, you know, now."
2343.0,2351.0," You basically assume that the skies of one of your enemies and then you know, people trade their ranks, but like he pulls out a cigarette case opens that up."
2351.0,2366.0," There's a few cigarettes in there, but then there's also like the screen of like the spyotron, whatever, you know, and it's just like some more cool tech and you punch in whatever costume that you want to select, you know, the from the ones on the screen and then that that's how you disguise yourself."
2366.0,2373.0," To replace the spies ability to fain death, which was just like an awesome awesome feature in team fortress."
2373.0,2379.0," They've made them, they gave them the ability to cloak, turn invisible for short periods, which."
2379.0,2388.0," The seducing work around it, they honestly couldn't figure out how to deal with the physics of the right, off physics and stuff of some of a live player, like fainting death."
2388.0,2395.0," I mean, that was kind of the excuse I heard, but I already do missed that ability because I found all these raps."
2395.0,2405.0," I would have a problem. Well, in the old game, of course, it was just like, I don't know the exact detail. I do know that the mod makers that are making fortress forever found a way to do it."
2405.0,2407.0, I don't know what their work around is.
2407.0,2409.0," Oh, bullshit then."
2409.0,2410.0, Maybe it is.
2410.0,2412.0, The mod makers could do it for them.
2412.0,2420.0," But it was like so it was it was extra risky reward when you would physically fain death because if someone called your bluff, they could go sit on your face and like you couldn't get up."
2420.0,2423.0, It was a lot of their crowbar and just smack you outside the head.
2423.0,2428.0," It wasn't a gameplay reason, like they were just like didn't say like fainting us to the top of the ground."
2428.0,2439.0," It was kind of like, when the last we did the cover story with them, I was what I thought I heard from it was those attack reasons and it had to do with just the difference in the physics and stuff now."
2439.0,2442.0," But hey, well, we'll probably hear if we got to run."
2442.0,2444.0," So, okay, I'll try to speed this up now."
2444.0,2446.0, We're going to have to really quick impressions.
2446.0,2454.0," First, it's like this is really simple just because there's no secondary grenades and those, I mean, because I don't care about the regular fry grenades."
2454.0,2458.0, I don't I don't object to them. We're moving them. They were actually quite of a problem.
2458.0,2471.0," The game bay was the secondary is the Altfire grenades that really that helped push the distinctions between each kit over the edge and now that each one's only got like three weapons with a few exceptions for extra items like, you know, the spyoutron and stuff."
2472.0,2479.0," So, I can this is just super straightforward. But at the same time, it was like one of the most well put together shooters."
2479.0,2482.0, I can never remember playing any just even feeling that.
2482.0,2493.0," And what I mean put together, I don't mean balance and stuff like that, but just it feels like the production on it is just great. Like everything feels right and it seems like it's just nailing that."
2493.0,2508.0," But then I just might my concern would be that the reward for, you know, the longer you play an individual kit and team for it just classic to more you'd get out of it, you know, you'd learn specialized techniques and stuff."
2508.0,2515.0, And now I'm worried that that will only hold true for on a team level where it has to do with coordinating your team tactics and stuff.
2515.0,2522.0, And I want that there in the individual level. They say there's stuff that we haven't seen and that people are doing and that they're not talking about.
2522.0,2538.0," So we'll see, but I also know like all said and done, I still was like wanting to play it more and it was just so much fun. Again to you know, this rocket jump and build century guns and the last note, the pyro is a fucking madness now he's ruthless."
2538.0,2550.0," You just to be the most useless class and I'm like we'll see if they did overkill, but like now mid range damage over time attacks is blind anyone's set you on fire and you're sort of like burning and burning hurt."
2550.0,2557.0, Say that whole thing again mid range damage over time that's almost like see we got to get a.
2557.0,2562.0," I'm not going to get our PG. Yeah, you know, area effect."
2562.0,2569.0," Yeah, really. It's all the same game. You guys, is there anyone in this room that's going to play it? I will play it. I'll play it. I'll play it. I'll play it. I'll play it."
2569.0,2579.0," I won't. You got to find this out. Yeah, before I end the valve talk, why is it that like you, you know, you got into half-light to and you're like, okay, all these years, even though."
2579.0,2588.0, Better looking game technically better looking games would come along since then you didn't play it right when it launched and you got it. There's so many people that don't do it like it's for to my knowledge.
2588.0,2593.0, Dan shoe from EGM mark. We don't have not played half-light to any form.
2593.0,2595.0," You can. Yeah, I still haven't."
2595.0,2604.0," But it's like because it's so fucking good. And if you like they're both like shooter fans and if you think that you like shooters, you need to like to be qualified to talk about single player shooters. You need to play it."
2604.0,2611.0," I'm an RPG fan and I've been played a final fantasy since 7. There's a very, there's a big division there. I guess you could argue."
2611.0,2616.0, There's a division between console and PC shooters. But between Japanese and Western.
2616.0,2618.0," Yeah, I think it's more of this half-light."
2618.0,2620.0," It was on a console already, so it's coming out."
2620.0,2622.0," It was. It's coming out the one, so they really have no excuse."
2622.0,2623.0," Crispin notes. Oh, I was right."
2623.0,2626.0," It really, really liked it on Xbox and heat."
2626.0,2628.0, It's super bad.
2629.0,2634.0," I don't know. I'm curious to see if it'll take with people or if it won't. And if it doesn't, why the hell not?"
2634.0,2641.0," I don't know. I really think that, to me, it's like, showed up at least for like narrative."
2641.0,2646.0," And in first person shooters, showed up everything that I played on console."
2646.0,2652.0," I mean, I don't know, maybe, maybe a shoe is like a more of a multiplayer guy."
2652.0,2655.0, It's certainly not a game to play with your friends.
2655.0,2659.0," Because every time you look on Xbox Live, he's playing like Godfather for achievements."
2659.0,2663.0," Yeah. He was on mobile, more of all the little lions forever."
2663.0,2665.0," Just for now, get like a perfect 1000."
2665.0,2666.0, Totally out of the game.
2666.0,2668.0, I've got to play with the console guy.
2668.0,2671.0," And every week, just so we can give him shit."
2671.0,2673.0, Why are you console guys so stupid anyway?
2673.0,2675.0, But I can't even play the game.
2675.0,2678.0," But you know, I tell you guys what my first computer was."
2678.0,2683.0," Yeah. I didn't know in a computer until, like, I don't know, ninth grade."
2683.0,2685.0, And it was from Renta Center.
2685.0,2691.0, And it came with some sort of like off-brand version of Windows that I can't remember the name of it.
2691.0,2693.0, It was like geosum thing.
2693.0,2694.0, BIOS?
2694.0,2695.0," No, it wasn't."
2695.0,2697.0, It was the older I got in grad school.
2697.0,2698.0, So yeah.
2698.0,2702.0," So that's what, you know, I'm definitely coming from like a console thing."
2702.0,2707.0," But the thing, the weird thing is now that console games are so focused on what was, what"
2707.0,2710.0, PC gaming has been all about for a while.
2710.0,2714.0, I'm certain you realize that that's what I dig nowadays is stuff like half life or
2714.0,2715.0, BIOS shock.
2715.0,2718.0, And I think a lot of console gamers are like that.
2718.0,2722.0," So, you know, if don't feel bad that people aren't playing PC games because they're just playing"
2722.0,2724.0, them on their TV and the living room.
2724.0,2725.0, Yeah.
2725.0,2726.0, Yeah.
2726.0,2727.0," Oh, we don't feel bad."
2727.0,2729.0," I just think those are just like, just feel sorry for them."
2729.0,2731.0," I just, I don't know."
2731.0,2735.0," Like, I want to believe I want to have, I want to like nurture my conspiracy theories that"
2736.0,2738.0," people just don't like, I don't know."
2738.0,2739.0, They tend to ignore something.
2739.0,2743.0," If not, if it wasn't console native, but there's just some sort of like bias against it."
2743.0,2744.0, I don't know.
2744.0,2745.0, I really felt this way after bias.
2745.0,2746.0, Here's the bias.
2746.0,2747.0, Hold on.
2747.0,2748.0, Here's the bias.
2748.0,2751.0, I work at a computer all fucking day long.
2751.0,2755.0, I do not want to sit at a computer and play games after work.
2755.0,2756.0, I've had.
2756.0,2757.0, I want to sit on my couch.
2757.0,2759.0, I want to watch my HDTV.
2759.0,2763.0, And I want to play something relaxing with my friends.
2763.0,2766.0," I don't want to like, I have to pretty continue to sit in my chair."
2766.0,2767.0, That's a good point.
2767.0,2768.0, Yeah.
2768.0,2769.0, It is a good in subwords.
2769.0,2771.0," It's like, like, totally subjective."
2771.0,2772.0," You know, let's do it."
2772.0,2773.0," I mean, like, I don't want to."
2773.0,2774.0, I play darkness.
2774.0,2776.0, The whole time I was playing darkness.
2776.0,2780.0," Like, I was wishing it was on my PC because I felt so far away on my couch."
2780.0,2784.0," And I was like, I need, I'm not in this world unless like, it's on my nice, like,"
2784.0,2785.0, I've seen your TV.
2785.0,2787.0, I know what you have our way.
2787.0,2789.0, It's like a 22 inch.
2790.0,2792.0, I'm not in the 8090.
2792.0,2793.0, I'm not in the 8090.
2793.0,2794.0, I'm not in the 8090.
2794.0,2797.0, I think it's just when you get the HD television.
2797.0,2799.0," Like, you get the five hangar in the antenna."
2799.0,2800.0, You get the good.
2800.0,2802.0, I have like the good since that's where the hardware's at.
2802.0,2804.0, Like the audio and the visuals.
2804.0,2807.0," And it's like, I feel closer to the action."
2807.0,2809.0, Maybe if I had one of these chairs.
2809.0,2810.0, Yeah.
2810.0,2811.0, I think it's a bit too big.
2811.0,2814.0," I'm also, you know, the five is goes the other way, too."
2814.0,2818.0," You know, it's, I mean, we get accused all the time of being of not taking"
2818.0,2819.0, the camera.
2819.0,2821.0, I think it was a great game.
2821.0,2823.0," Like, but in specifically in that context, you know,"
2823.0,2824.0, I do too for a shit.
2824.0,2827.0, I don't think the single player's going to end.
2827.0,2831.0," But I was going to say, I saw again at E3 and it was kind of driving me nuts"
2831.0,2835.0," where like, no one even talked about how it was there and playable."
2835.0,2838.0, No one even talked about the orange box stuff.
2838.0,2841.0," But even more so when I saw all those awards for,"
2841.0,2843.0," I mean, just the beauty page in awards."
2843.0,2846.0," Like the best, like, specifically, what's the best looking shooter of the show?"
2846.0,2851.0," And like to say COD over crisis, which is like so like if you look."
2851.0,2854.0," See, COD looks great and the new movie just came out."
2854.0,2855.0, But look at that.
2855.0,2858.0, I dare you put that side to side of crisis and tell me at the straight face.
2858.0,2860.0, You think it's a better looking game.
2860.0,2862.0," And again, like there."
2862.0,2865.0," That's not saying anything, but it was kind of like, yeah."
2865.0,2869.0," Well, on the, you could say, if you want to go on the objective level and say,"
2869.0,2873.0," I mean, you could objectively say that the engine that cry to cry,"
2873.0,2875.0, the cry engine is doing a lot more.
2875.0,2880.0," It's performing a lot and simulating a lot more elements of light, physics and things like that."
2880.0,2882.0, That doesn't necessarily mean it's better looking.
2882.0,2883.0, But that's about as cool.
2883.0,2884.0," I mean, you could make that case."
2884.0,2893.0," And you could say, then you could go back and look at it at the results of that processing and point out that that they're not in the other game."
2893.0,2896.0," And that like because they are in this one, it's pretty, it's pretty damn cool."
2896.0,2897.0, The way they are.
2897.0,2901.0," I thought, chalk it up to perfectly like the new factor because we had seen crisis before."
2901.0,2904.0," Yeah, and like, Call of Duty Farmers like, oh my god."
2904.0,2906.0," I mean, I think that has something to do with."
2906.0,2914.0," What it did, it didn't even mean you'd have to, that would explain the same two four like it didn't get like FPS to show or anything."
2914.0,2918.0," And that had a playable thing, whereas you could only watch the other, you know, called it."
2918.0,2924.0," You could only watch, uh, activation and infinity or people's like, these are words are stupid."
2924.0,2926.0," Right, we've already, we totally agree."
2926.0,2928.0," But it just kind of like, it just bugged me, man."
2928.0,2929.0, I don't know.
2930.0,2936.0, I don't know. I don't know. I also think same that a game looks good because it's technology kicks ass is kind of sad.
2936.0,2938.0," But that's, do don't even like try to spell that on the band."
2938.0,2941.0," This is like, oh, I like is like, I know."
2941.0,2945.0," I know, I know between art direction and like that's a fucking game facts, not a game fact."
2945.0,2949.0," That's like a, uh, gaming age form post like, this is God, better art design."
2949.0,2955.0," Not arts, what do they call it? They call it, they mean to say art design, but they call it something or the other."
2955.0,2961.0," It's just a stupid, but yeah, like, I know it's not like I want video realistic games and that's all I want."
2961.0,2970.0," I was just talking about how fucking incredible team fortress two looks and it's like as far from reality as you can get, but we'll not as far as like every extent extra or something."
2970.0,2977.0," But like, but for that kind of game, COD, the thing is COD model warfare wants to look realistic."
2977.0,2981.0," It's not like me comparing this to, uh, what is it?"
2981.0,2984.0," I don't know, beyond good need or something like that, you know."
2984.0,2992.0," Yeah, not that I'm like a call, I mean, I haven't even looked at Call of Duty because it just for me, like world war or any war shooter."
2992.0,2993.0, I would have been around that.
2993.0,2996.0," Whatever they're on now, although I hear they're up to modern warfare."
2996.0,2997.0," Yeah, I've come on."
2997.0,2999.0, So I'm interested in how they represent that.
2999.0,3000.0, The game looks totally rare.
3000.0,3006.0," I hope you get the bus into Abu grade and like, I look people from, from like electric torture machine."
3006.0,3008.0," You get to like, torture them yourself."
3008.0,3010.0, That's a whole mini game.
3010.0,3012.0," Yeah, that was it."
3012.0,3014.0, We're interested in that game.
3014.0,3020.0," They can, well, if I said this before, that they'll, they'll identify the specific locations,"
3020.0,3026.0," everywhere in the world, except those involving the Middle East, and then it just becomes somewhere in the Middle East."
3026.0,3033.0," It's like the set set piece where it's like, if it's Russia, it'll say, here's the street we modeled this after and here's this and."
3033.0,3034.0, Right.
3034.0,3036.0," So yeah, what is that like random?"
3036.0,3037.0, Is there a tour?
3037.0,3038.0," Yeah, right."
3038.0,3042.0," To the vast majority of Americans, it's just, you know, you're Arabs."
3042.0,3044.0, You can carry Arabs.
3044.0,3049.0," If you want, if you want them, if you want them, if you want them, if you want the whole Abu Grace scenario,"
3049.0,3052.0," they'll get, was it, uh, area 51 black site?"
3052.0,3055.0," I mean, that's kind of like the whole thing behind it, but they,"
3055.0,3057.0, they turned that instead to area 51.
3057.0,3062.0," So it's like, uh, extraordinary rendition is now area, if it is now,"
3062.0,3063.0, make it as video.
3063.0,3069.0," That's the only, that's the only way we can deal with like reality and video games is to turn it to sci-fi."
3069.0,3070.0, Right.
3070.0,3072.0, The only way we can deal with it.
3072.0,3073.0, Yeah.
3073.0,3074.0, It is.
3074.0,3075.0, Or something.
3075.0,3076.0," No, I mean, that game looks cool."
3076.0,3080.0," I mean, at least somebody has the balls to make a game about that stuff."
3080.0,3081.0, Strong and terrifying.
3081.0,3084.0," And it is, yeah, as long as it's about aliens."
3084.0,3085.0, Yeah.
3085.0,3086.0, People using science.
3086.0,3087.0, Fucking aliens.
3087.0,3088.0, Can't see if that's a long run.
3088.0,3091.0," So I mean, times do we have to kill them?"
3091.0,3092.0, Yeah.
3092.0,3093.0, We're going to take a break.
3093.0,3095.0, And we'll come back for more.
3095.0,3096.0, Good.
3096.0,3097.0, Bon.
3097.0,3098.0, And happiness.
3098.0,3100.0," Three, two, one."

3123.0,3127.0, So we got a couple of big topics here.
3127.0,3130.0, The big one that we actually had Robert come down for us.
3130.0,3133.0, We should get to that before we run out of time.
3133.0,3135.0, Which was about your travels.
3135.0,3136.0, Yes.
3136.0,3137.0, Travel.
3137.0,3139.0, You traveled the world like Charles Corral.
3139.0,3145.0," Often for us and sometimes not for us, but for various stories that Robert writes."
3145.0,3146.0, You should last second.
3146.0,3149.0, What have you meant to like just for the overware.
3149.0,3151.0, Where did you go to see the Witcher?
3151.0,3155.0," I went to Warsaw, Poland to see the Witcher."
3155.0,3159.0, I went to have Ukraine and to Chernobyl for stalker.
3159.0,3160.0, How fuck that's right.
3160.0,3161.0, You went to Chernobyl.
3161.0,3162.0, Yeah.
3162.0,3163.0," Hell, you do in here."
3163.0,3164.0," I mean, let him in here."
3164.0,3165.0, No radio active.
3165.0,3167.0, Because it's like a guy or counter at the center.
3167.0,3168.0, That sounded amazing.
3168.0,3169.0, Yeah.
3169.0,3173.0, They make you pass through a radio activity detector before you leave.
3173.0,3174.0, They're really awesome.
3174.0,3175.0, Yeah.
3175.0,3177.0," That just for show, which is part of your tour."
3177.0,3180.0, They will definitely stop you there.
3180.0,3183.0," If you also, if we're sitting down here now podcasting in like we could see."
3183.0,3186.0," Robert's like skeletons, threatening a lowly with skin here."
3186.0,3190.0, I did develop special powers from visiting Chernobyl.
3190.0,3193.0, But I can't explain to you the very personal.
3193.0,3198.0," But yeah, I also, I've been to Shanghai a couple of times."
3198.0,3200.0, I've been to Helsinki.
3200.0,3201.0, Yeah.
3201.0,3203.0, That's up in Helsinki.
3203.0,3204.0, That's not the way.
3204.0,3205.0, That's plain.
3205.0,3206.0, Alan W.
3206.0,3207.0, Right.
3207.0,3210.0," What I want to hear about first though, in all of your many tales, it doesn't"
3210.0,3215.0," involve, well, it comes back around to work some way, but you recently went to France"
3215.0,3216.0, and Italy.
3216.0,3217.0, Yeah.
3217.0,3218.0, So I take me to that train man.
3218.0,3220.0, Put me on that train.
3220.0,3227.0," So we had summer vacation with my wife's family, the Enlaus, the Granny Trip, as it's called,"
3227.0,3229.0, it's a France and Italy.
3229.0,3233.0, And we ended up taking this night train from Paris to Venice.
3233.0,3238.0," And all the rest of the family gets on a car, a sleeper car, to themselves, six beds."
3238.0,3242.0," I end up in one of the stranger in first class, though, which is nice."
3242.0,3247.0," But I end up hanging out in the family car until late at night, sort of sneak it"
3247.0,3253.0," into my bed with the stranger in the room, late at night, sounds terrible."
3253.0,3259.0," But you know, I sleep sort of, and so about six in the morning and sort, you know,"
3259.0,3263.0," here in this knocking at the door, really insistent knocking, and I figure it must be the train"
3263.0,3267.0, porter because I hadn't had my ticket checked or my passport or anything.
3267.0,3273.0," And once I get the door open, I see him there and his face just like freaks the fuck out."
3273.0,3278.0," He's like, whoa, and grabs me by the shoulders."
3278.0,3281.0," Rips me out of the room, and I'm just totally, physically."
3281.0,3286.0," Physically, rips me out of the room and starts jabbing on me like this."
3286.0,3291.0," Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul can be in the chest and screaming at me in Italian."
3291.0,3293.0," Every once in a while saying,"
3293.0,3296.0," Get out, get out, get out."
3296.0,3298.0," And I'm like, whoa, whoa, I have a ticket."
3298.0,3299.0, I have a ticket.
3299.0,3300.0," I'm screaming, I have a ticket."
3300.0,3304.0," I'm rummaging through my pockets, and I can't find my ticket."
3304.0,3308.0," And he's just, you know, pushing me around, slap me around, looking for the ticket."
3308.0,3313.0," He gets fed up, I guess, with what he was doing, and he runs back to his little office"
3314.0,3318.0," there, and do you guys know what an expressive machine's like, port of filter looks like?"
3318.0,3320.0, It's the thing that you put the fuck in.
3320.0,3321.0," It's a big metal hand, right?"
3321.0,3325.0," It's really hot, and he grabs, he's running down the hall."
3325.0,3331.0," He comes at me, he comes at me with this thing, and starts beat me in the arms with it,"
3331.0,3334.0," like in the biceps, which I got burned because it was hot."
3334.0,3338.0," I mean, I was bruised, it's old now, this is like a monkey guy."
3338.0,3339.0, But I was in a tree.
3339.0,3342.0," I was like, cut her in each fucker."
3343.0,3347.0," I was covered in bruises and everything, but you know, the whole time I'm just thinking,"
3347.0,3351.0," like, I can't do anything because I'm in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country,"
3351.0,3353.0, and this guy could just kick me off the train.
3353.0,3356.0, So I'm trying to block him and everything.
3356.0,3360.0," Finally, I run into my room, and I find the ticket on the little end table in there,"
3360.0,3363.0," and I give it to him, and it doesn't even settle him down."
3363.0,3366.0," He just starts screaming like, yes, today, it must be yesterday."
3366.0,3371.0," And like, just, you know, having a fit, and I give him my passport,"
3371.0,3375.0," and after he, I guess, you know, is satisfied with his amount of screaming at me."
3375.0,3380.0," He leaves, and I sit there on my bed, and of course, my bunkmate is awake,"
3380.0,3382.0, and this is where the story gets weird.
3382.0,3390.0," Because my bunkmate's awake, and I'm like, man, that was really fucking crazy."
3390.0,3394.0," He was like, yeah, yeah, and we start having this normal conversation."
3394.0,3396.0," He's got a British accent, I ask him where he's from."
3396.0,3399.0," And he says he's from LA, or that's where he lives now."
3399.0,3401.0," And I was like, oh, what do you do?"
3401.0,3403.0," He says, I make video games."
3403.0,3405.0, I'm a game programmer.
3405.0,3410.0," And I'm like, no shit, you know, I write about video games in San Francisco."
3410.0,3412.0, I mostly for the Zifthames people.
3412.0,3415.0, And I don't like where this is going.
3415.0,3418.0," And he goes, wait, wait, wait, what's your name?"
3418.0,3423.0," And I was like, Robert Ashley, and he's like, hey, yeah."
3423.0,3426.0," And so it turns out, the guy is a programmer for Activision."
3426.0,3431.0," Turns out he worked on the game True Crime New York,"
3431.0,3435.0," which was a really, like, steaming pile of crap game."
3435.0,3437.0, And I'd panned it and review.
3437.0,3441.0," And actually it was worse than that because while it's playing,"
3441.0,3445.0," well, it was playing, well, it was playing."
3445.0,3447.0, I got all these crash bugs.
3447.0,3451.0, And so I had to be in contact with the PR people who were calling them
3451.0,3455.0," and complaining about these crash bugs, just to verify this stuff."
3455.0,3458.0, And so he was getting harassed by my stuff.
3458.0,3463.0, And he was so like what Sean calls Wajah.
3463.0,3465.0, So embarrassing.
3465.0,3466.0, It's six in the morning.
3466.0,3468.0, It's been beaten by a train porter.
3468.0,3473.0," And he starts telling me about how, because the game got such terrible"
3473.0,3476.0, metacritic ratings that they didn't get the bonus for the game.
3476.0,3477.0, And all this stuff.
3477.0,3481.0," And I'm just like, oh, God, this is like the crap story."
3481.0,3484.0," Yeah, I'm just like, yeah, I'm just like,"
3484.0,3486.0, I just like happy you got beat.
3486.0,3489.0, You probably developers dreamed.
3489.0,3491.0, What happens to a critic of Pantheon.
3491.0,3495.0, I bet there was a little bit of like a fantasy.
3495.0,3496.0," Oh, fuck you."
3496.0,3497.0, But he was nice.
3497.0,3498.0, It was just weird.
3498.0,3501.0," He's like, I should have moked at that."
3501.0,3504.0," Wait, do you ever find out why this guy was beating you?"
3504.0,3507.0," Well, because I showed up late at night, I didn't have my ticket."
3507.0,3508.0, My ticket checked.
3508.0,3511.0, He thought that I was coming from one of the second class seats
3511.0,3513.0, without a bed and that I'd come into the room.
3513.0,3515.0, And he would knock up in the first place.
3515.0,3516.0," Yeah, yeah."
3516.0,3518.0, And so that serves as a burning and a beating.
3518.0,3520.0, But also the guy was a psychopath.
3520.0,3521.0," Well, yeah, I'm crazy."
3521.0,3524.0," He's like, if I handle that, he's just a bit of a beating."
3524.0,3526.0," No, we don't."
3526.0,3529.0," We were actually, we had a lot of trouble in Italy."
3529.0,3533.0, And you don't just go and start trouble with a train porter.
3533.0,3537.0," Unless he, I mean, he did avoid hitting me in the head, which I appreciated."
3537.0,3539.0," And I just let it be, because we were like,"
3539.0,3541.0," we were like, extorted later by another train porter."
3541.0,3542.0, It's crazy over there.
3542.0,3545.0," Yeah, the guy could have been like mobbed up or something."
3545.0,3546.0," Well, he's a Italian."
3546.0,3547.0, Of course.
3547.0,3548.0, But I may not.
3548.0,3549.0, They all know my opinion.
3549.0,3550.0, I play video games.
3550.0,3551.0, I play video games.
3551.0,3552.0, I play games.
3552.0,3553.0, I play games.
3553.0,3555.0, They're all in the mafia.
3555.0,3559.0," But yeah, it was, well, the second time in the game."
3559.0,3563.0," It's because on the trip to see Penny Arcade, the game,"
3563.0,3566.0," and Van Cover, although this was less embarrassing,"
3566.0,3569.0," I went to Hothead Games, and there's a guy there."
3569.0,3573.0," A lot of the people there worked for Radical, and there's a guy Joel D. Young,"
3573.0,3576.0," who is like the one, I don't know if he owns the place."
3576.0,3578.0, He's a producer. He runs the studio.
3578.0,3582.0," And over lunch, he was talking about their last game being this crash band"
3582.0,3584.0," acute racing game, which I had reviewed really badly."
3584.0,3588.0, And he was talking about how nice game journalists didn't get it and stuff.
3588.0,3590.0," And he, and you're either getting it or you don't."
3590.0,3592.0," I was, you got to live that."
3592.0,3593.0, I don't get CTR.
3593.0,3597.0, But I was lucky enough for him to not realize that I had been on the room.
3597.0,3600.0," So I felt, because I felt okay about that."
3600.0,3601.0, But yeah.
3601.0,3603.0, So hit me up with a damn bad story.
3603.0,3604.0, I got that.
3604.0,3608.0, So going back to that train ride for a second with the dude from Activation.
3608.0,3610.0," Once that revelation happens, you just kind of see the guy."
3610.0,3611.0, So.
3611.0,3612.0," That's like, oh, I got up and left."
3612.0,3615.0," That's like, we've all got six hours, like, to the deck stop or so."
3615.0,3618.0," We were three hours away from Vanistau, and I had barely any sleep."
3618.0,3622.0," And I just got up, and I went back to the family car and crammed into this"
3622.0,3623.0, little seat.
3623.0,3624.0, Everyone else is sleeping.
3624.0,3628.0," And I spent like, you know, three hours like this under a bunk."
3628.0,3629.0, Wow.
3629.0,3634.0," You know, I hope you'll have someone like you know, and you'd still get a six today."
3634.0,3635.0, Fuck.
3635.0,3637.0, I think it was a three.
3637.0,3638.0," Oh, a three."
3638.0,3639.0, Yeah.
3639.0,3641.0, You got a swindled while you were on assignment for us in Shanghai.
3641.0,3642.0, All right.
3642.0,3643.0, I did.
3643.0,3644.0," That made the story, too."
3644.0,3645.0," That was the, yeah."
3645.0,3646.0, The T and sitting there.
3646.0,3647.0," That's the four that, too, though."
3647.0,3649.0," Like, I mean, even on the, I thought, come on out of the train station."
3649.0,3651.0," Some, some people will try to take your bags."
3651.0,3654.0," Well, that was, that was later in the trip, actually."
3654.0,3656.0," Like, uh, where's the story was this part?"
3656.0,3659.0," This, this was, this was for the game of Splinter."
3659.0,3660.0, Okay.
3660.0,3662.0," G's, whatever."
3662.0,3664.0, This is double it.
3664.0,3665.0, Which ever won it was?
3665.0,3666.0, Double it.
3666.0,3667.0, Yeah.
3667.0,3668.0, Yeah.
3668.0,3669.0, There we go.
3669.0,3672.0," And, uh, speaking of the fact, let me show whatever."
3672.0,3676.0," Um, but, but it was, you know, I'm, I'm a total fool, I guess, but I was out,"
3676.0,3680.0," I was out in this really populated part of Shanghai near People's Park, which, if anyone knows,"
3680.0,3682.0," I think, I've been working on the park for a couple of years."
3682.0,3683.0, Yeah.
3683.0,3684.0, Yeah.
3684.0,3685.0, Yeah.
3685.0,3686.0, That's a lot nicer.
3686.0,3687.0, And that's how it is.
3687.0,3688.0, Yeah.
3688.0,3689.0, Yeah.
3689.0,3690.0, But nobody dared in the park.
3690.0,3693.0," No, no, no, no, no, crazy cracked out people asking to change."
3693.0,3694.0, Yeah.
3694.0,3695.0," But, um, yeah."
3695.0,3696.0, I was just walking around.
3696.0,3698.0," I'd been to the museum and I was, I was, I was walking, and, and there was a couple"
3698.0,3703.0," next to me who seem, you know, just like another young couple out, out,"
3703.0,3704.0," out, doing their thing."
3704.0,3708.0," And I ended up having a conversation with them and we talked, having the sort of normal"
3708.0,3712.0," conversation with them, and I was really excited for, and, you know,"
3712.0,3713.0, stranger and foreign land conversation about.
3713.0,3714.0," Hey, how do you live for you?"
3714.0,3716.0, This is how I live back home.
3716.0,3717.0, We're having a new live camp.
3717.0,3718.0, Yeah.
3718.0,3719.0, Yeah.
3719.0,3720.0, It was like that.
3720.0,3722.0," And they get, you know, they talked about, you know, they were students"
3722.0,3724.0," from out of town, blah, blah, blah, blah."
3724.0,3727.0, We end up going to get T at a T house.
3727.0,3729.0," They're like, you want to go get some T, you know,"
3729.0,3731.0, we know it good spots get some T.
3731.0,3735.0," And we go have this T ceremony, I'm thinking, like, the whole time,"
3735.0,3738.0," this is like, right, I'm like, I'm in the culture."
3738.0,3739.0, I'm meeting people.
3739.0,3740.0, Yeah.
3740.0,3742.0," I'm like, I'm discovering Chinese T."
3742.0,3745.0, I've tried all these amazing T's.
3745.0,3747.0, They're explaining all these legends about T's.
3747.0,3748.0, It's a great.
3748.0,3750.0, We get the bill after afterwards.
3750.0,3753.0, And the bill is like $200.
3753.0,3754.0, Right.
3754.0,3756.0," And which I hadn't thought the entire time, I'm like, I'm in China."
3756.0,3758.0, I can afford T.
3758.0,3762.0," But it was, it was so awkward."
3762.0,3764.0, And I didn't even get it at that point because I'm stupid.
3764.0,3765.0, I'm all done.
3765.0,3766.0, I got interrupted.
3766.0,3767.0, Are we late?
3767.0,3768.0, No.
3768.0,3769.0, No.
3769.0,3770.0, Okay.
3770.0,3772.0, We're getting dirty like some of the fucker who always gives us three.
3772.0,3773.0," I'm like, starving guy."
3773.0,3774.0, There we go.
3774.0,3775.0, Sorry.
3775.0,3776.0, Sorry.
3776.0,3777.0, Keep going.
3777.0,3778.0, Yeah.
3778.0,3783.0," So, you know, we end up making this agreement that they're going to pay for, you know,"
3783.0,3786.0," the T, the extra T that we bought to take home afterwards."
3786.0,3789.0, And so that knocked like $50 off the price.
3789.0,3793.0," And I just, I left and said I'd meet up with them later."
3793.0,3795.0, I'm still going to get it because I'm an idiot.
3795.0,3803.0," And about 15 minutes after I left their company, I'm walking down Nongin Road, which is kind of the Broadway of Shanghai."
3803.0,3807.0, And there's a lot of hucksters out there and I didn't really realize it.
3807.0,3811.0," And about 15 minutes later, to a couple, walk up to me with the exact same story."
3811.0,3812.0, Oh my god.
3812.0,3815.0," And to the point of like, I mean, the conversation was similar."
3815.0,3817.0," Like, what kind of music do you like?"
3817.0,3819.0, And their answer was the Eagles.
3819.0,3823.0, Both couples said the Eagles.
3823.0,3824.0, It was really Eagles.
3824.0,3825.0, They're just big over there.
3825.0,3827.0," No, you told your California."
3827.0,3829.0," You're just, I did."
3829.0,3833.0," Yeah, they might have had a different answer if you were from Texas."
3833.0,3834.0," I, maybe."
3834.0,3838.0," Well, it's the first mistake was having the, the cowboy boots and the,"
3838.0,3841.0," and the big smile, the big stupid smile on my face."
3841.0,3845.0," I mean, the second time I went to Shanghai, I ran into those people a million times."
3845.0,3848.0," And every time I was just kind of mess with them, they would ask me where I'm from."
3848.0,3851.0," And I would say Shanghai, they'd say, oh, and then like walk away."
3851.0,3855.0, And I would just sort of like lead them on.
3855.0,3857.0," Because they're all out there, like trying to,"
3857.0,3861.0," I, everywhere you go, if you, if you stick out there, you're just at"
3861.0,3863.0," old things, like, you were like, ask right up the bat like,"
3863.0,3865.0, you can buy you some tea.
3865.0,3868.0," I just, you don't just go up to actual people."
3868.0,3869.0, I just started asking them.
3869.0,3870.0, You guys want to go get some tea?
3870.0,3871.0, Just cut up the middle of the Eagles.
3871.0,3872.0, Go straight to it.
3872.0,3875.0," The first time I was in France, I got off the train."
3875.0,3879.0," And some guy was, was basically, you know,"
3879.0,3881.0, hustling me for money.
3881.0,3884.0," And he was giving me the whole story about how, I mean,"
3884.0,3888.0," I was very young and six, in fact."
3888.0,3890.0," No, I was actually a 22."
3890.0,3895.0," And he was giving me the whole, sob story about, you know, whatever."
3895.0,3899.0," He lost his thing, you know, just the kind of story you get from"
3899.0,3900.0," everyone, everywhere."
3900.0,3902.0," But because he was saying it to me and broken English,"
3903.0,3906.0, I stupidly was thinking he must be telling the truth.
3906.0,3909.0," Because he's, wow, he's trying through the barrier of another language to tell me"
3909.0,3911.0, how hard he's had it.
3911.0,3914.0," So I handed him what was probably like,"
3914.0,3917.0," 20 American dollars, you know, and you know,"
3917.0,3920.0, this is normally someone you might give a quarter or something.
3920.0,3922.0, And I could tell he actually looked bad.
3922.0,3924.0," Yeah, like he looked like he felt bad."
3924.0,3927.0," When I gave him up to money, like, I can't take this money."
3927.0,3929.0," You're, you're a two stupid."
3930.0,3933.0, I'm going to give you change for that because I just
3933.0,3934.0, talked to you too.
3934.0,3936.0, So he peels out his water bills.
3936.0,3937.0, Yeah.
3937.0,3939.0, Here's a tip for you.
3939.0,3941.0," That happened to me on the, on the, on the bar,"
3941.0,3943.0," when I first moved out here,"
3943.0,3946.0, there's the lady who is always on the bar asking for a shit.
3946.0,3947.0, We've seen her.
3947.0,3948.0, She comes in.
3948.0,3949.0," You're on, you take the same thing."
3949.0,3952.0," Yeah, I gave her like $10."
3952.0,3953.0," She's like, yeah."
3953.0,3956.0," Yeah, I've, I've caught that same thing like twice in the single day,"
3956.0,3957.0, I think.
3957.0,3958.0, Yeah.
3958.0,3960.0, But they back on the other thing.
3960.0,3966.0, You have like a good story from Warsaw that you told me that involves someone that works for game pro.
3966.0,3967.0," Oh, yeah."
3967.0,3969.0, Can we make fun of the competition?
3969.0,3971.0," No, it's not making fun of it."
3971.0,3972.0, It's actually just a player.
3972.0,3974.0," There's, there's just involved game industry."
3974.0,3975.0, Okay.
3975.0,3978.0," Well, you know, we're there for, for the witch."
3978.0,3980.0, This is why I like to share.
3980.0,3981.0," Man, yeah."
3981.0,3982.0, Yeah.
3982.0,3983.0, So cool.
3983.0,3984.0, Yeah.
3984.0,3985.0, I'm incredibly cool.
3985.0,3986.0, A fuck are we doing in this?
3986.0,3987.0, Yeah.
3987.0,3988.0, Yeah.
3988.0,3989.0, You have to be a freelancer.
3989.0,3990.0, It's amazing.
3990.0,3991.0, The main thing is the money.
3991.0,3993.0," You know, you got to just throw the kind of green."
3993.0,3994.0, Yeah.
3994.0,3995.0, You got to big fat roll there.
3995.0,3996.0, Yeah.
3996.0,3997.0," No, we pay you."
3997.0,3998.0, That's your money roll.
3998.0,3999.0, Yeah.
3999.0,4001.0," It's, it's pretty amazing."
4001.0,4003.0," But we're, we're there to see the witcher and we're, we're staying at the hotel"
4003.0,4004.0, Ibees.
4004.0,4008.0," And after we, after we'd seen the game, we go out to dinner at this kind of,"
4008.0,4014.0," I don't know, Polish Roadhouse type place where they have like traditional Polish food."
4014.0,4017.0," And a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of alcohol."
4017.0,4018.0, Mm-hmm.
4018.0,4020.0," Like so much alcohol, of course."
4020.0,4022.0," And not that I, I was fine."
4022.0,4025.0, But there are a lot of people getting an extremely wasted.
4025.0,4033.0, One of which was this French journalist guy who nobody seemed to know where he was from or who he was with.
4033.0,4036.0, But he was like incredibly drunk.
4036.0,4039.0," And by the end of the night, I'm just going to be like a turtle neck."
4039.0,4040.0, Yeah.
4040.0,4041.0, Yeah.
4041.0,4042.0, Yeah.
4042.0,4043.0," No, yeah."
4043.0,4044.0, Yeah.
4044.0,4047.0," No, no, it was so serious that people were wearing it."
4047.0,4049.0, He was wearing a black turtle neck.
4049.0,4050.0, Yeah.
4050.0,4051.0, He had a buray.
4051.0,4052.0, No.
4052.0,4053.0, No.
4053.0,4055.0, He was black turtle neck and last year.
4055.0,4056.0, And tall skinny guy.
4056.0,4057.0, Yeah.
4057.0,4062.0," But I, I had been hanging out all night with this guy Andy from, from Game Pro, a cool kid, like,"
4062.0,4064.0, 19 or 20 Mohawk.
4064.0,4067.0," Very stylish, which may have brought us on."
4067.0,4071.0," But, but at the, on, in the bus on the way to go back to the hotel,"
4071.0,4074.0," everyone's talking about, let's go out clubbing."
4074.0,4079.0," And, you know, which is totally fun and Warsaw."
4079.0,4084.0," But, but this French guy, like, attaches himself to, to our group."
4084.0,4094.0," And as, as we're leaving the bus, as we're leaving the bus, he looks to, to Andy, the Mohawk guy with me and goes,"
4094.0,4097.0, I'm going to fuck you tonight.
4098.0,4114.0, I'm so excited about what he said.
4114.0,4119.0," And my version always emphasis, is like, what you told me at first is that when, as soon as you landed, the cab drive,"
4119.0,4121.0, first thing the cab driver was doing.
4121.0,4125.0," It was like emphasizing that he could get you women to, did you want to go to it, because,"
4125.0,4128.2," I was like, I'm a little bit of sex because Yolks said the game pro guy was like"
4128.92,4135.24, Way convinced that he was gonna score big with the Polish women because there was because there was a guy from Atari
4135.68,4141.08, Who had gone out club in the night before and like swirping down that he had three women
4141.56,4145.98, That were all over him because he said he was an American so that it borne this idea
4145.98,4150.18," Yeah, yeah, because we're so popular over there. Yeah, we're pretty popular in Poland"
4150.18,4152.18, Poland
4152.18,4156.9800000000005," America then there aren't Poland now and there are a few reasons for that that are not funny, but yeah, that's that's a fact"
4156.9800000000005,4161.54, That's what inspired the club visit and the whole the whole thing was just so I mean
4161.54,4163.02, Because the French guy came with us
4163.02,4169.38, He forced his way in this whole thing and he kept on in the club like going up to everybody and trying to dance on him and like
4169.780000000001,4171.780000000001, Like getting in everyone's face and
4171.780000000001,4179.3, He ended up getting a lucky with the French guy. No the game pro guy was was running his game on the Polish ladies and avoiding him very
4179.38,4185.9400000000005, Successfully the the the the French guy ended up getting kicked out for something that happened in the bathroom
4185.9400000000005,4187.9400000000005, One can always don't want to dwell
4187.9400000000005,4194.3," So yeah, yeah, I got a story one time. I traveled like across the city to my friends house"
4194.900000000001,4200.7, And we used to always play gold night in 64 which was like surprising to people because I'm such a you know
4200.7,4203.78," PC shooter horn now, but that was where I got my start and"
4204.38,4209.14, He would always play this piece of shit would always play grace Jones like what's her
4209.14,4216.18," Character's name made a made a yeah, he would always play made a and like he would get so mad because we'd always go for"
4216.18,4218.1," You know, he's like shoot made it is a big tall"
4219.38,4221.860000000001, So one time you should like
4222.26,4226.34, Fuck you fucking quit get me and I was like grace under fire dude
4231.700000000001,4233.46, That she was truly funny
4233.46,4235.46, Yeah
4235.46,4238.74, So hard because there's a big pause and everyone was like
4239.78,4242.5, Like it's just uttered since you know that they're like close to it
4243.7,4247.3, Pretty brilliant how how many fights did that game
4248.58,4253.54, That game was all of my college you're looking at my corner. I can tell you're looking at my corner. Yeah
4254.66,4260.02, That goes along that goes well with our intro that only a few of you have heard here today and gives me a chance
4260.02,4266.5, Also to give I heard it credit to Zudad granny once again who spent all the time in talent doing that of course
4266.5,4274.02," Actually, which other production yeah, it's it's about fighting games and it's sort of like the old the difference between"
4274.42,4279.06, You know how how it was you know the arcade and the traditional street fighting game that
4279.46,4285.46, Build that place and then the super competitive game play later became the domain of the first person shooter
4285.46,4287.46, You know
4287.46,4289.46, Yeah
4289.62,4292.34, So we got 10 minutes left
4293.54,4295.54, You want a new
4297.54,4303.86," I just found this out today that from chud cinematic happenings under development yeah, and they"
4304.58,4309.3," Kind of like it sounds like an aint cool news type thing where they track stuff, but yeah, so someone"
4310.1,4312.58, Ranna review of a script for Jurassic Park
4313.14,4314.98, For yet
4314.98,4319.0599999999995, Says the script credentials weren't peckables will you monahan and John sales
4320.34,4325.3, Thoughts it was a little on the outside you see this time out the story wouldn't take a group of humans to
4325.86,4331.7," Isla de la Carnosaurus, but rather bring five trained and armed dinosaurs together to meet out prehistoric justice"
4335.14,4337.14, Yeah
4337.14,4339.94," And trained okay, so all this"
4342.58,4345.94, Dude you guys like brumacly put brumac on our cover and we're like yeah
4346.9,4350.18, You start talking about Jurassic partners. I can prove acting in this sounds awesome
4351.78,4353.78, That's what the series needed
4354.1,4356.9," Dinosaur's with guns yeah, yeah, okay. This is"
4358.98,4363.86, Bloody disgusting is also learned that universe was big and casting which would go before the cameras is winter and Hawaii
4363.86,4368.26, They also heard the basic story line genetically modified well armed dinosaurs remains the same
4368.820000000001,4370.820000000001, Sweet
4370.820000000001,4376.42, Five the subtitle just with for when lasers mass pre just or wait pre his structure
4379.7,4386.26, I thought this is where video games though are like a negative force in the world because like if not for video game
4386.26,4392.18," Well, I don't know there's some pretty shitty movies, but I kind of think if not for video games this script wouldn't have made it as far along"
4392.18,4395.9400000000005, I don't know if I said this is so many shitty movies way before games ever came along
4396.9,4402.259999999999, This kind of dinosaur guns they were like what was the most popular selling video game of last year?
4402.9,4404.9, And then they look at what's the fucking most like
4405.46,4409.86, Talked about creature in it brew mac or whatever and they're like hey we already got the dinosaurs
4410.0199999999995,4412.74, Which dinosaurs could actually hold it take turn on it?
4412.74,4415.46, Don't most of them have those little like
4415.78,4417.78, Because they're probably just gonna go to a moment to it
4417.78,4419.379999999999, They're probably just gonna put like
4419.38,4425.9400000000005," To the little mac something of a prondosaurus. Yeah, I got to be genetically behavior enhanced to be really smart like be clear something"
4427.9400000000005,4430.66, It's just like adding a laser to a shark like our
4431.86,4435.06, Our dinosaur in a gauyu yeah our dinosaurs not deadly enough
4435.7,4438.74, Like damn these dinosaurs can't kill fast enough
4438.9800000000005,4442.58, Every say we thought the raptors were scary like everything yet
4442.58,4447.3, It's a guy to track everything menacing about a dinosaur doesn't need the gun and then everything that like
4447.78,4453.62," Manacing about gun doesn't need the dinosaur to make it any more effective, you know like that must have been some awesome, you know"
4453.62,4458.42, Marketing this is finding strategy meeting to be in it's dinosaurs with guns
4459.86,4461.86, What about
4463.86,4466.66," You know what okay, that's what they response was let's do it"
4467.94,4471.46," Well, they have my interest peaked and I would have ignored any other platform"
4471.46,4475.14, So spiel bergs probably not directing maybe it's kind of like that they just don't give it shit
4475.14,4480.66, It's like snakes on a plane they're like we'll just have some like a bunch of like internet retards making jokes about it for like two years
4480.66,4486.58," That's more like that to you right, but snakes on snakes on the plane, you know, it'll be a pirate's versus ninjas movie two for the same reason"
4486.58,4490.9800000000005," Like just right now for that reason. Yeah, yeah, you're right about that. You know what no doubt"
4492.26,4494.26, Let's so
4494.26,4497.3," We haven't got kicked out. Yeah, you hear that internet if you're out there listening"
4498.1,4499.3, Let's you
4499.3,4502.18," You want to hit up that yes, RB things since we haven't got kicked out here. Yeah, we got it"
4502.18,4507.14," Yeah, we got it. We got a couple of minutes to hit up the latest EIS RB stuff beat the clock"
4507.54,4508.74, This is a general
4508.74,4512.820000000001, We've kind of talked about this forward come back to it. Gamma's future put up a story today
4513.3,4514.34, Where um
4514.34,4520.02, fact your five president Julian and I'm sorry for not being able to pronounce it for the last name right it might be egg brec
4521.3,4525.3, This is devoted is keynote to censorship and game shortly sharply criticizing yes
4525.3,4529.06, RB for a bizarre system of rating games such as his own PS3 exclusive glare
4530.34,4533.06, Some of the things that he takes the issue with are interestingly
4533.54,4538.74, the way that the ratings are are allocated one example he has is that
4541.14,4545.54, What is this was there was the blood splatter with the chewing up human is opposed to like setting them on fire
4545.54,4547.54, I think that was part of it
4547.54,4549.7, That is the different setting people on fire
4549.7,4551.06, Just read it exactly
4551.06,4557.06," For example to get yeah, you could blow up a huge flying man to troop transport a living being but factor five had to reduce the gore many times"
4557.06,4560.820000000001, Thanks to feedback in the end only explosion is left the second example
4561.38,4569.14, Dragons control by the layer player eat humans and the dragon can interact with two on the humans with intended and already program blood spray and physical physics effects
4569.46,4571.22, in the end to get a teen rating
4571.22,4576.580000000001, All the ragged off physics and blood had to be removed from the title so of course they were still eaten
4577.14,4583.14," But they just didn't rag dolls being eaten and they weren't you know, and you could say that yeah, like though both"
4583.46,4588.74, For the same reason they wanted to put the rag doll physics in and the blood is because it enhanced the sense of you know
4588.74,4591.54, What was happening right it is something kind of silly
4592.1,4598.0199999999995, I'm reviewing you know metal of honor airborne now and that's like a series that traditionally gets a teen rating and
4598.26,4601.78, Because there's no blood and it's so weird you're still shooting a guy in the head
4601.78,4606.259999999999, It won't you get extra points for doing it and a little icon appears on the screen to tell you you're done so
4607.78,4613.0599999999995, But because no blood comes out for whatever reason. It's just one of those you know
4613.94,4615.94, Mysteries of
4615.94,4623.139999999999," Right right a little bit of a dog bites man story, right? I mean because the moral here is like the ratings board are morons"
4623.3,4627.139999999999," Right or their rules are morons, but that goes to seem for like all ratings boards"
4628.1,4632.34," Yeah, so for example to give because it's important he says you explained in the game"
4632.34,4635.860000000001, You could spew fire setting thousands of people like who then run around screaming
4635.9400000000005,4641.780000000001," But that was no problem for the yes or these right because I want to get there's no blood. Yeah, that's what's amazing"
4641.780000000001,4645.22, Or you change the blood color sometimes they're okay with that that's that's the absurdity
4645.22,4653.06, There's the murder the mortal combat thing the funny thing is and games you can kill as many people as you want as long as it doesn't feel like you're killing people
4653.54,4656.42, Like as long as you feel like a disconnected psychopath
4657.22,4659.22, Then it's all good
4659.22,4661.860000000001, Like killed millions thousand whatever
4661.860000000001,4667.700000000001, It's fun if you make someone feel like maybe they shouldn't be popping people in the head
4668.26,4671.780000000001," With a shotgun then oh, man, that's terrible"
4672.820000000001,4677.46," Yeah, like you I think maybe you should feel like there's some consequence to shooting someone in the head"
4677.860000000001,4679.06," Yeah, right dude"
4679.06,4683.46, Good fine like it could be the first time you club someone with like a piece of like rebar or something
4683.46,4687.14," You're like yeah, I just do that. Yeah, yeah, because they they get that you know"
4687.94,4690.58, And then it makes it like it makes it cost lightly
4690.58,4694.42, I'm not trying to promote the case for them being like the most tragic enemies you ever fought
4694.42,4700.02, But you're like right we're human at one point and you get the whole vibe with the zombie where we're so used to zombies now
4700.02,4702.82, It's like fucking the shoot them all it's like a smash TV or something
4702.82,4708.42, But at once upon a time the whole part of the allure of the zombie was that like well that might have been your cause
4708.42,4710.9," Yeah, I'm on and that one point that was a"
4710.9,4713.62, And then that of course is the equivalent and then
4714.98,4724.339999999999, See if yet anything else to say so so Julian just criticizes the whole system after this is being an absolute as being absolutely bizarre and he calls it a charade
4725.299999999999,4727.78, I think part of it he was also saying is that you know
4727.78,4731.78, It's just kind of like this all or nothing like you do that team that teen rating or the maturity
4731.78,4734.82, There's no like equivalent of a PG 13 where you can have like a little bit of leeway
4734.82,4738.66, I had a little bit of those functions and right right he did say that yeah
4738.98,4743.94, There's so he's probably right that there should be something in the tweet right well plus because I think they have that in Europe right
4744.18,4750.66, I mean obviously they could have kept the scene if they were going for an M rating so there's that whole other element of like they for trying to get a teen rating
4750.9,4753.139999999999," You know, and that's the publishers kind of decision"
4753.139999999999,4758.66, But I mean like at at at that point are you taking away enough like are you taking away your damaging the game play too much just to hit that teen rating
4760.0199999999995,4764.9, It does seem like a lot of games that are pushing at the edges of each of the categories like back game
4764.9,4771.219999999999, Wanted to push the teen game a little bit and the in the more explicit direction while you know
4771.219999999999,4775.94," You hear a condemned again that I can't say the guys name, but there is a"
4777.219999999999,4784.179999999999, He was one of the designers of condemned was talking in an interview about the chilling effect of man
4784.179999999999,4789.46, Man Hunt two being rated A O and how they were scaling back what they were doing and and condemned to
4790.02,4796.42," Out of fear of that, you know, and you get the situation where M is like the highest possible rating any game with commercial"
4796.9800000000005,4802.82," Yep, a appeal could possibly get but yeah, you know, it's definitely a cap on what you can do in game"
4803.38,4808.66," The the larger story to it's not unique to games, but just you know, media and American general is the"
4809.54,4812.34, The weird disparity between how we respond to violence and sex
4812.34,4815.860000000001, We've and he points that out to you cannot have
4816.34,4823.7," You cannot have any like element of sexuality in in the game, especially you can't he says you can't indicate anything about homosexuality"
4824.26,4826.26, But it's interesting because I
4826.900000000001,4830.66," Mean I don't even really need to talk about we're all used to hearing the argument, but hey just think about it"
4830.66,4831.860000000001, The fact that like
4831.860000000001,4837.22," A pair of titties is gonna like ruin someone's world, but whatever else you can do in man Hunt is well, you know, right"
4837.78,4839.14, That's that that's something that
4839.860000000001,4843.38," Over the years, you know, the letters that we've gotten into the magazine"
4844.34,4850.740000000001," You know, I get mail all the time from from readers and from parents and as"
4851.46,4857.62, Apparent myself and as an era and chief in the past I felt if it's a like while written letter if it's something you just saying fuck you
4857.9400000000005,4860.26, You know and not even spelling that correctly
4860.34,4861.06, You know
4861.06,4868.740000000001," F UK I'm not inclined to write him back, but if a parent writes me with the concern about something in our magazine as as far as early to their kids"
4869.22,4874.5, I'm inclined to want to write him back and what always what bugs me more than anything else is when I get letters some parents
4874.820000000001,4876.18, Because they're pissed off
4876.42,4881.9400000000005, That they saw something in the magazine that they felt wasn't appropriate for their kid and it's like a
4882.58,4888.9800000000005, Guild Wars chick in a you know in a leather top where like most of her breasts is exposed
4888.9800000000005,4896.02, But not even completely and then on the other side of the same spread there's like eight dudes with their heads cut off
4896.34,4902.580000000001," Yeah, but what bothers me is the is the half exposed breast and I've actually even said that in my responses to them"
4902.580000000001,4908.9800000000005, I'm not I'm not judging you. I'm not telling you what you should be offended by or not. I'm just saying
4910.580000000001,4913.22, I find it interesting that this is what you just
4913.22,4919.06," Right, is anyone really surprised that humans are more comfortable with killing each other than having sex with each other?"
4919.46,4921.46, That's cultural though. That's definitely
4921.46,4925.14, It's what it is cultural across the world
4928.42,4933.7," Well, I was gonna say it's it's a it's a it's a quick out it's quicker culture. It's like it's third world culture"
4934.26,4937.7," But it's like you know, yeah, I mean like this is not an eight minute conversation"
4937.7,4939.94, I totally would have one time for this crap
4940.82,4944.34, But the short version is like we've had this ass back where it's great
4944.5,4949.54, Greating system for mobility since the foundation of our nation and God forbid we we talk about sexuality at all
4950.5,4954.18, It's it's totally absurd. I mean they left Europe for a reason because I wanted to be an anal here
4954.42,4959.22," Yeah, well and also it's a lot sex is a lot hotter when you keep a dirty that's my theory"
4960.0199999999995,4962.9, That's that's my theory about all this power you know
4962.9,4969.3, It's like the the Florida congressman that got arrested for soliciting a blow job in the park a few weeks back
4969.3,4973.62, I think all those all those guys who want to like outlaw dirty sex while committing it themselves
4973.62,4975.62, Just want to keep it as
4975.62,4977.22, As like
4977.22,4980.18, Right just because it makes it and they turn to my right
4980.18,4984.9800000000005, That much more I think Americans just really like like really really dirty sex
4985.62,4987.62, I think
4987.62,4989.62, You know here
