137.60000000000002,139.60000000000002, Anthony for lending me his
139.60000000000002,141.60000000000002, Seven volumes of the walking dead
141.92000000000002,145.76000000000002, Graphic novels because I was about the only thing that my brain could handle while I was sick
146.48000000000002,147.44, It bed so
147.44,151.36, It's some heavy shit. It is really heavy shit. That's a good comic book recommendation
153.12,158.8, But it was it really was a little bit weird reading about zombie apocalypse while I was fevered and half dead
159.20000000000002,160.8, That's how it starts for weeks
161.04000000000002,165.52," Super fast starts. Yeah, I did tell you guys before we started recording that I kept"
165.92000000000002,167.92000000000002, I was re I would be sleeping and
168.16000000000003,173.52, Sleeping in that horrible fever like sweaty state and then I'd wake up and think I can read another chapter
173.92000000000002,177.04000000000002, And then I'd read it and then I go back to sleep and then like in my dreams
177.68,182.64000000000001, Totally over and over to the point where like I thought I was gonna stop reading it in my dreams. It was
183.20000000000002,187.76000000000002," The zombie apocalypse, but then not just in the dreams, but like the part of me was it going like okay"
188.16,190.16," No, this is just a dream so it's cool"
190.56,192.16, That part was going like
192.16,194.56," Okay, but there really is a zombie apocalypse though"
195.44,198.64," I'll stop dreaming about it, but then there really is one in that sucks"
201.76,203.76, That's like you're resell value on your home
204.64,207.92," Probably kill the resell value on your comic books too, which I like"
208.64,210.64," Which I flamm all of it, but I"
213.04,217.28," But thanks, any fault rules apply you give the bugger master over here"
217.76,222.39999999999998," Yeah, if you have to do they you know comic book, you know when you do the whole whatever they do the"
222.39999999999998,224.39999999999998," Right, so let's see you be telling yeah"
225.84,228.07999999999998, Mint condition definitely not the case anymore
229.84,232.23999999999998, That's what else is going on haven't seen you guys in two weeks
233.28,235.28, Just playing games
235.28,239.28, Just making a magazine
239.28,240.64, I'm actually
240.64,245.44, Two weeks to prepare for this so you have to say playing games making a magazine
245.52,248.88, In reading about I could tell you about a Puskashi
250.88,252.88, But we want to know what that is
252.88,256.08, Is something we're gonna go on be sorry that we actually know you'll be
256.88,260.08, Intertained I'm delighted to learn about Puskashi. It's uh
260.8,268.0, It comes from a basically buzz as a goat and Kashi is bashing and it's essentially a sport played in central Asia
268.8,270.08, That
270.08,276.32," Allegedly inherited there's I mean, it's not it's like perfectly documented but allegedly inherited from you know in gangas cons Mongol hoard"
276.96,282.88, Was dominating the region and it basically consists of a bunch of rugged ass horsemen
283.76,287.03999999999996, The waves plate now like in Tajikistan and to shunby they'll be wearing
287.28,290.56, Soviet tanker helmets you know a big leather padded helmets and
291.28,292.47999999999996, They take a goat
292.47999999999996,299.12, They decapitated they soak it overnight in in salt water and then they throw it into the field and this is like the equivalent of a ball
299.36,303.6, And all the horsemen the rules of the game they're basically our no rules other than you have to grab
304.32,310.96, Grab the goat by leg or by a scruff or something and get it across the field and into this this sort of like gutter thing
310.96,316.72, And they're at the handy mean no the body the heads gone they probably have that super such as the carcass
316.88,319.52," Yes, so you get the carcass but the thing is is that"
320.64,324.64, Everyone is trying to do this so and if you get it you're you can be
325.36,331.03999999999996, Stamped it trampled you can use your wips. It's okay. So people will try to whip each other and take up into their noses and ears
331.68,335.03999999999996, And it's like I was looking I was reading about all this and well
335.68,340.0, A source that's like I don't know it's always open attention Ted Raw he does these you know comic
340.96,347.12, You know news reporting things named mixes them with travel log books but he's been like running the site called stand watch for like a decade now
347.12,349.12, He's just completely in love with the
349.68,356.16, Central Asian stand countries and he goes there and he arranged his trips with people he actually got into App Gana stand in 2001's another story
356.32,361.2, But then so I supplemented that with a bunch of other research like there's no way this isn't saying people do not do this
361.28000000000003,369.04, It's just crazy blood support and I looked and up and sure enough. I mean a found all these records like in the year that he went the year prior to the one that he witnessed
369.76,374.48, Like 20 people were killed and during the course of the of the week and because it got super muddy
374.48,376.48, But what happens is basically you run up for it?
376.56,380.8, You you got to lean down imagine you're right in the horse lean down and grab this heavy thing and at the same time
380.8,385.04, That's when everyone else waits to charge you and with this shit out of you and try to think it's for them
385.12,387.52000000000004, You but I just wanted to tell what happens if you get it
388.16,392.56, Then you have to run then you have to get the hope you hopefully your horse keeps running and you get it through the goal
392.96000000000004,397.84000000000003, I know the way do you get for making a goal like you you win the the total tally?
398.16,403.12, I don't know how many rounds they'll do like presumably quite a few but then whoever has the highest court the end
403.36,408.8, There's like the third place usually the prizes like carpets and stuff you get a carpet or you might get a goat and then the
410.8,416.32, You need to choose I get a goat with the goats worth more in the carpet and the grand prizes of Volga sedan
416.32,419.12, You know like the Simo. That's you know a Soviet era
419.68,423.52," Pieces shit car, which is actually worth the whole haul of a lot when you when you live in the"
423.84000000000003,425.84000000000003, Especially some rural part of Tijikstan
426.72,430.72, Brad you got a game that sounds just like this coming out on you. What's that? I don't know
431.68,434.16, I would know they need to be a gate made of this
435.68,440.24, This is so many questions. It is so hard to render a headless goat though
440.24,443.68, I'm gonna get you on the hair and all that sort of thing because it's like mad
443.68,450.48, It gets mad at it after a while and then where's your Ezher throwing it around you want to you still want the legs to kind of flop around naturally
450.48,453.44000000000005, Which reminds a lot of physical deforming this happens
453.44,458.8, They're in real people kids in the crowd will sometimes get a leg from the buzz and they'll whip it around and
459.28,461.92, Play with it during the during the meat and stuff
462.48,465.2, There's a family they don't want to use boards
466.08,471.36, Why did they bother to capitating it? I don't know why they do that. That's weird. Maybe because it would be too much of a mess
471.36,473.36, You know where
474.8,477.52, Originally the rumor has it that it was it was during
477.68,484.0," Cons-rain it was bodies that was used and this interesting thing happened bodies. Yeah, oh, sorry. Yeah, it's people but"
485.03999999999996,489.52, This there's this been this big resurgence in the sport because you know and I've got to stand
489.52,494.32," It was traditionally really big there, but the Taliban and stuff look frowned upon it is this pre-Muslim activity"
494.32,499.2, And they banned it so it's come back after the Taliban's when the post and then likewise
500.08,504.24, When you know all these countries were part of the Soviet Union when they're you know Soviet satellites
504.56,508.64, It was like similarly frowned upon so after the fall of Soviet Union as well
508.8,513.12, There's like this resurgence and you know what it it's sort of like you know pre
514.16,519.36, National you know activities and stuff even though they used to getting in getting into many complexities
519.36,523.6, But because they weren't all different countries like this back to stay in Tijikus stand where
525.84,530.24, I bring it up. I bring it out because I think it's interesting especially when you know you get to this point
530.48,534.24, You feel like you've heard about everything you heard something about every country in the world
534.5600000000001,539.28," Yeah, and then you look in you're like I have my my shower curtains a map and you look on that that map"
539.44,540.64, You're like
540.64,544.8, I don't know anything about this place and then you go look it up and there's something good their shower curtains
544.8,546.8, And then suddenly you're sorry
548.16,552.72," No, I'm not sorry for that's good like people should when they're making games like fallout and stuff"
553.04,555.04, They need to draw inspiration from these kind of things
555.92,557.76, Carcass
557.76,559.76, Carcass tosser
559.76,561.76, The world's worst
561.76,563.76, Coming from start
565.04,570.08, I know be thankful for your piece. What did one that you jacked Tomson upset if we make it came like that
570.3199999999999,573.12," He probably probably oh, let's just go carcasses. Yeah, yeah, yeah"
573.76,575.76, Probably plays it himself
577.28,580.3199999999999, You just kind of like want to roll them all into the field instead
580.96,584.64, There are hey guys how about this instead? Yeah of the goat carcass
584.72,586.64, There all sorts of fun it's a roll better
587.1999999999999,591.4399999999999, This is another one I forget the name I'd have to have about the book with me to brush up on it
591.52,593.92, But it's basically a
593.92,600.88, Like a courtship game where a man will attempt to catch a woman a woman's on horseback too and I'll attempt to catch her and
601.76,603.76, Like plan a kiss as
603.76,608.88, They're they're both riding and then but she's able to fight back with lethal force if she wants
609.4399999999999,612.72, And then it's like it's really weird
612.8000000000001,618.08, It's almost like I don't I don't know I should wear it. Where's this? This is just I saw this run
619.76,621.76, Eventually it gets to the point where
622.64,624.64, I don't know if certain other
625.2,629.76, Inscrutable rights are observed in the guy that gets a full kiss from her and they actually have like a tent
630.08,634.24, Families have a tent set up on the on the side and then they'll go and consummate the thing you have to
634.5600000000001,639.2," You're trying to catch it, but there's a lot of women according at least to the source that that don't like it one bit and"
639.6,646.1600000000001, There's never any kissing so a whole lot of there's like vast areas of human behavior not accounted for in the gaming world
646.72,649.84," There yeah, we need to take a long-term consideration"
650.72,652.72," Yes, when the embrating is just not enough"
654.88,656.88, Like homie rollers
658.0,660.08," Yeah, that's bring up homie"
662.6400000000001,666.72, Just bring up homie rollers bring it up sure just there's a story
666.8000000000001,673.76," But genuine Hispanic guy on our podcast today. Okay, we do you can you can be our test market all right"
673.76,680.48," The story on what up is the top five it's labeled the top five racist games. Yeah, oh and originally proposed it as"
681.28,683.9200000000001, The top five games with racial
683.9200000000001,688.1600000000001, Stereotypes right which is pretty significant difference from you
688.1600000000001,691.28, But I assume it's also a single hit difference for Google hits and
691.6,693.8399999999999, The search results and also for just
694.64,700.0799999999999, Digibility it's stuff like that. I don't know how it changed it. It was right so it's posted as a top five racist
700.72,706.72," Races games of all time yeah, and the number one game on the slets is a game called homie rollers"
707.4399999999999,713.1999999999999," I don't know if you guys know this franchise at all, but this is a DS game and it's the first"
714.0799999999999,717.6, First I guess video game made out of this this whole
718.24,721.6800000000001, You know industry this this dude started called homies
722.16,727.0400000000001," Which is a little plastic capsule to us. Okay, so you know of this see the Hispanic dead now"
727.0400000000001,730.4, I know about I know about them you know about homies right so
730.4,734.72, So it's all workers that used to happen all over the desk the homies they've been around for a while
734.72,737.0400000000001, You know about homies no I'm out of touch
740.72,746.64, And so it was founded by this guy David Gonzalez and he I was reading interviews about it
747.28,749.28, With him this this morning a Google
750.16,756.3199999999999, That that I'd found where and this goes pre bet before the existence of the video games where he was getting called
756.8,762.4, By different media outlets about like are you perpetuating racial stereotypes are you you know
762.4,765.04, Are you perpetuating the idea that all
765.6,768.88, Hispanics are into gang culture or whatever and he he said
770.0,776.24, The contrary that he felt like this was like representing barrio life and this is what people are really like and that all these characters
776.32,779.12, Am I game have a backstory and if you go read the backstory
779.6,784.32, They're all like honorable people who are doing good things and they're trying to avoid gang life and things like this
784.72,788.4, So that that's the mess is this guy's sending but you know when
789.92,793.28, Levels putting it as one of particles looking at top five racist games
794.0,798.16, They you know thought of this DS game where I guess you know you blew it up and you just got heavy
798.16,801.44, sky going a mama you know a eating tacos or whatever
801.7600000000001,806.8000000000001," So to him that was racist, but I don't that's what I'm sure he's about I haven't played the game"
806.8000000000001,811.9200000000001, But he said they were driving burritos driving burritos. I can't imagine if that's the case though
811.9200000000001,815.2800000000001, That's that's a bad that's not that's a racial stagio
816.0,820.8800000000001, Thinking to an extreme but I don't know if that was a joke or what I honestly don't know I didn't play the game
820.8800000000001,822.8800000000001, I didn't write that one. I have no idea
823.5200000000001,825.5200000000001, What about culture to revenge?
825.5200000000001,831.12, That was the classic that was like I think what they did was they put that in the intro for the story and said that like this is so
831.2,832.8, obvious it's kind of like if you're talking about
833.52,838.88, Best albums of all time and you're sick of like the guaranteed spot for you know thriller and then whatever
838.88,841.6, Beatles albums always end up in there. It's like we're gonna like
842.24,845.04, Hate up some other stuff because I'm a custard. I mean that's the
845.76,846.5600000000001, That's the a Padeum
846.5600000000001,848.5600000000001," Yeah, yeah"
848.5600000000001,850.5600000000001, First
850.5600000000001,853.44, How the number one racist game of all time is on an intendo system
854.72,859.2," Something funny about yeah, well I sent out an email to a few people online because I thought like"
859.84,864.72, It doesn't maybe wonder because I don't know like why dude like it sounds racist to me
864.72,871.6800000000001, But then like if this game is like made by his Hispanic guy and it's pitched to the Hispanic audience
872.24,873.76, Then maybe
873.76,880.24, Maybe the only people who are being racist here are actually the white people who think it is racist when in fact it's just
882.32,887.0400000000001, A cultural thing that just doesn't there's a few layers there. I mean other things that it's a joke article
887.92,894.3199999999999," Yeah, sure is conceived as is that like where I mean because like punch out was in there and that's like no"
894.3199999999999,896.3199999999999, I mean again
896.3199999999999,898.3199999999999, It's racist
898.3199999999999,901.52, There's racial stereotypes you know like there here's the here's the dude
901.52,904.8," Nate well, I mean the whole great white hope theme in your new man is"
905.8399999999999,913.12," Helper the Morgan role and but aside from that like in the arcade games, you know there's pizza pasta as the Italian boxer and you have all this kind of"
914.08,920.4, I'm upset with that whole story though so when I did a couple entries and they got insanely edited so that they're not funny at all
920.96,923.68, Really it's a bad I shouldn't be saying that I shouldn't have brought this up
923.68,925.68," It's a bit yeah, I"
925.92,932.0, The part for me and never knew it just it just struck me as when I read that article as odd that that game was picked
933.28,935.76, Because I'm just trying I can't even think of like what was that
936.64,939.6, We used to have that almost that toy that was around here that was like that
940.32,944.88, From that franchise it was like it's like urban it was like blacks what was it?
944.88,947.2, You guys were talking about or something wasn't it like the herbs?
947.2,952.08," Like that yeah, he's like another Sims game member you read the back of the box at one point"
952.08,956.64," I know that toy that we had on the podcast. Yeah, well that I don't know you're confused me"
956.64,961.36, I was expecting you to say like MJ's got like that little writer toy that plays like La Cucca or
961.36,968.96," Chara or something and like bounces on my job. What does mean like like the that other toy was like you know like but black toy, you know for like"
970.24,972.24, Black kids
972.24,974.24, I don't know
976.24,984.88, I just feel like if the if you know like let's say that I as a Jewish guy decided you know my kid and all her friends
984.88,991.28," They don't have any like good like toy role models, you know my my daughters like playing with Barbies and shit and she's obviously like some"
991.6800000000001,993.6800000000001, Prec and you know wasp
993.6800000000001,995.6800000000001, You know
995.6800000000001,997.6800000000001," Possibly Catholic or worse, you know"
998.64,1004.0," And I don't want my daughter, you know, she doesn't have any good sort of like humly Jewish looking"
1004.88,1012.8, You know superhero at you know to look up to you know she can't be she's no dolls that are like obviously Jewish and you know kind of dumpy looking
1014.3199999999999,1016.3199999999999, Really good at math
1018.3199999999999,1020.3199999999999, That's actually
1020.3199999999999,1022.3199999999999, Maybe she needs one or so
1022.32,1026.24, Signed as I've decided that I'm gonna just I'm gonna make a line of dolls
1027.04,1030.4," You know like Jewish dolls. Oh, what can we call?"
1031.68,1036.16, I'm just not hanging only you can answer and I'm not going to because I'll take it deeper whole
1036.48,1039.8400000000001, But let's say so I just decide I would like want to have all these
1040.24,1042.24, Like the five seconds away from pulling the loot-ups
1042.8,1044.8," Yeah, I'm so I'm so excited to be a"
1045.44,1049.68," Right so close to a fitting it will flit any but he might still be listening, but let's say okay"
1049.92,1056.24, I get the money I have a month I get a bunch of my my wealthy Jewish fans because you know we control the whole world monetary fund
1056.5600000000002,1059.3600000000001, Let's say that that we get a bunch of money together
1059.3600000000001,1064.8," We make these dolls that are supposed to appeal to like Jewish kids, you know because they don't want to play with Barbies and"
1065.28,1070.96, In these and these dolls happen to have certain characteristics the other people might consider
1071.44,1075.28," Racist or stereotypes, but then I might consider well that's just part of our culture"
1075.28,1078.4, This is thick because you know there's like if you don't know I don't like
1079.1200000000001,1083.44," I didn't have very many Jewish friends going up, but then like I would only think so to associate with it"
1083.44,1087.68, Like the diversion of the Jewish toys or a dredle and like the gold-gold coin chocolate
1087.68,1091.52," You're like right dude, who what racist made that up gold coin chocolate?"
1091.52,1094.16, That's what I'm supposed to Jewish kids are galic and yeah
1094.48,1096.5600000000002, So that maybe that's the same like that's what I'm saying
1096.5600000000002,1099.68, It games racist that cholos got like exactly it's a mile high
1099.68,1106.3200000000002, I'm saying let's say that every dog that cholod does every dog comes with every doll comes with six pieces of gelt
1106.6399999999999,1108.96," Which are like these gold coin chocolates, okay?"
1108.96,1113.52," That's like what I grew up with was gelt and then yeah, then you guys see the game"
1113.52,1118.3999999999999, Get the box comes out and you pick it up and the doll's name is I don't know f-hole
1118.8,1123.76," Whatever, you know you open up the box and these gold coins come out and you guys go oh my god"
1123.76,1125.76," Well, that's so racist down bears"
1126.1599999999999,1128.8, They put money inside the Jew doll box
1129.36,1130.0, Wow
1130.0,1132.3999999999999, God those Jews are gonna be so offended
1132.3999999999999,1136.0, I mean what if that's all that just homey roller sing is that's what I'm saying
1136.08,1138.56," Yeah, that's my whole point it's all perspective"
1139.2,1143.68, You know there are play maybe you know you got Hispanic kids playing this game and you're riding around in a burrito
1143.68,1145.04, And I don't know what else they're doing
1145.04,1147.04, And they're like yeah
1147.04,1149.04, Just like it all
1151.44,1153.04, Okay
1154.8,1156.8, Stop stop me from talking
1158.4,1160.88, I don't know but it's just some extent I kind of understand what you're saying
1160.88,1164.24, I mean it might just be nice to have something in a game even if it is like
1164.88,1170.4, In a sense stereotypes something that they can even identify with in any sort of way rather than like I
1170.4,1175.44, Don't know a Barbie game or something like that right it is something that even if it's like
1176.32,1182.0, Doing it to the point where it's like a caricature of like what their culture is like it's still something that they can identify with
1182.48,1187.6, Right plus there's a difference between like a positive caricature and a negative caricature like if you're seeing something
1188.24,1192.48," You don't normally see in a game, but it's kind of the presented in a positive light. It's like a good character"
1192.96,1198.48, Like maybe you're not so offended that it happened to be a raging stereotype right at this similar issue way back when
1198.48,1204.24, Whenever you'd the game low rider for playstation two and it was like that because you could you could trick out
1204.24,1209.2, You know you get your low rider and it's kind of like a rhythm action game. You you know you do the buttons to make it bounce and
1210.32,1215.68, You go for height and all this other stuff you try to put on a peeling shell a crowd pleasing show for less
1215.68,1221.1200000000001, But the ways you do it is it's got the usual you know carrot thing where you you unlock points
1221.12,1225.28, And then you use the points to invest in your your vehicle and your show to what you can get is like a big
1225.28,1228.08, You know version of Guadalupe to put on the on the trunk
1228.2399999999998,1233.1999999999998, You can like pop the trunk and make balloons in the colors of the Mexican flag fly out and then like the
1234.0,1239.1999999999998, Cucoracha will play and horn and I'm doing this and I feel guilty as hell
1240.6399999999999,1244.0, But I'm like I don't know though like everything that you just said again
1244.0,1247.1599999999999, So instead though I kind of subverted it and like because you could make your own
1247.48,1250.0400000000002, Pictures with their their their little bit map
1250.0400000000002,1254.0400000000002, Interesting and put those so I made like a big dirty vagina and put that on the hood
1256.6000000000001,1261.4, You were reviewing it or you just playing it. I was reviewed it for you. How would you even do that like from like your perspective?
1261.4,1263.24, I don't feel art anything I said
1263.24,1266.68, You know I had to be on I want to be opening on us right now
1268.68,1273.24, That stuff happens in your board what it's like anything you're what do the same reason that people draw like
1273.72,1276.44, Dicks and stuff on bathroom walls like why would you draw a dick in
1277.16,1279.4, Like it's something just overcomes you you don't know it's prime
1280.0400000000002,1282.0400000000002, Never end
1282.0400000000002,1283.4, Never been draw a dick that you know
1283.4,1285.4," Yeah, it's here's what's draw boobs anyway"
1285.8000000000002,1287.64," Yeah, you draw it all I've seen like home murals"
1288.0400000000002,1293.0," It's like it's a rival like that and the best like talk or yeah, you know, there's like a full like sexual mural"
1294.28,1300.6000000000001," Yeah, every bathroom it or at least back on our dessert you see Berkeley every mentor him would be just murals of just horrible"
1301.0,1303.0, sexual drawings
1303.0,1307.08, And so like what this is this is the cream of the university
1307.88,1309.64, University crowd in the United States
1310.28,1314.52," Come on, it was that way at the University of Washington, you know in the art department in the bathrooms"
1315.48,1319.4, That and the only the only funny thing from it was that the toilet paper dispensers labeled
1319.96,1321.32, U.W. Diplomus take one
1321.32,1322.52, Which I'm sure
1322.52,1326.84, Is it joke repeated throughout the country universities across the nation? I'm sure
1326.84,1328.84, Yeah
1328.84,1332.84," But bet you thought this was what you were getting into hybrid. Oh, this is pretty tame"
1333.72,1340.12," Yeah, it is I decided not to read because I don't know because it's potentially offensive I brought some transcripts from"
1341.1599999999999,1345.08, I chat that Anthony and and GFW freelancer Rory
1346.1999999999998,1348.1999999999998, We're engaged in
1348.1999999999998,1351.9599999999998, We can't mention it now. I'm not talking about that's how I usually do it so I'm just
1352.92,1354.92, That's a bit of that. I just teasing
1355.16,1359.8," So we had just had to make sure I had this in my back park and it's like oh god, dude Brad's on"
1359.8,1361.48, I don't know if I can read this
1361.48,1363.96," He's your respectful business man. Oh, yeah, but"
1364.76,1365.72, So
1365.72,1369.32, There's a infamous guy this involves company here as it's not about company here
1369.32,1373.32," Really it's just about this conversation, but there's an infamous player named RIP 2000 and every night"
1373.32,1379.24, He hosts these four before games called Christian hosts and that's what inspired when we had like the series of Wicked Host games
1379.32,1383.32," But it was like spelled H Y S T, but so we were playing with them"
1383.88,1389.32," And he seems like a pretty nice guy, but then when you start talking to him when you's playing he gets a little crazy"
1389.32,1390.68, He gets a little weird
1390.68,1394.36," So we started you know I got a vent chat or no, this is all in game"
1395.16,1397.56, Rory was able to pull the whole thing from the game
1397.56,1401.56," I know it's right from the games because it's listing lag warnings and all sorts of stuff, but he"
1402.6,1407.48, So we start playing at three v3 hours on the other team Anthony and Rory run his team and they did the usual thing
1407.56,1409.48, They're like let's run to his base build
1410.44,1414.28, You know barbed wire and tank traps around his HQ and make sure that that's
1415.0,1418.1200000000001, The totality of his game is sitting inside his own little base
1418.76,1421.64, doing nothing so they started doing it and
1423.96,1428.92, Immediately you know Rory who's playing his gorgeous and gorging says I'm making your base a shining city on the hill
1428.92,1432.92, You are defended from all evils and then RIP says you have demons
1432.92,1434.92, I can help you get rid of them
1435.88,1437.88, Anthony's like see how protected you are
1438.3600000000001,1440.3600000000001, Look at me. I'm out here getting shot
1440.3600000000001,1443.16, The RIP says no I can help you and your demons
1443.72,1446.3600000000001, But you want you have to want me to help you
1447.0,1452.76," Then Rory says yes, they make me do this and every game I ever play and they tell me this is a good idea"
1453.4,1455.4," Then RIP says no, it's not"
1456.04,1458.44, The Rory says the urge is so strong how do I stop?
1459.0,1463.8000000000002, Well first you have to give the title to you if your life to Jesus and then if he says paper
1464.44,1467.24, Have you done that does my mom have that?
1467.24,1469.8, I don't have a deed to my life. How do I get this?
1470.6,1472.6, Well just the right to your life
1473.08,1475.08, In a way we're bad people
1475.8799999999999,1477.6399999999999, He's not laughing so I
1478.68,1482.2, Shouldn't hear it. I didn't know that people so
1484.68,1488.68, You and then so Anthony says do I have to kill myself and RIP says
1490.2,1493.32, RIP says no only in a way
1493.8,1495.56, If you actually kill yourself this is a waste
1496.36,1500.36, Help me understand okay then you must accept Jesus as the Lord your God
1500.84,1501.72, And then
1501.72,1505.3999999999999, RIP says I did already then RIP says good have you been filled with the spirit do you feel it?
1506.04,1508.04, I did this is so sacrily just
1509.08,1512.52, Is the game going on while the game is going on
1512.9199999999998,1513.72, Like collecting
1513.72,1515.72, I'm a dead team and we're beating shit up
1517.72,1521.6399999999999, But to be fair I started bombing like Anthony and in my attitude
1522.2800000000002,1524.2800000000002, So then then
1525.0,1530.3600000000001," Then they're just like okay, thanks for the help and then RIP's like no we're not done yet and then he's like"
1532.8400000000001,1536.76, He's like you have to be ready when the war starts between heavens men and the devil demons
1537.3200000000002,1539.3200000000002, So they said that sounds scary
1539.96,1541.3200000000002, And then
1541.3200000000002,1546.2, How do can we see these demons and then RIP says no are you ready to kick demonic ass now
1546.76,1550.1200000000001, Then RIP is my sister demon she has a tattoo
1550.44,1558.1200000000001, RIP says yes she will have some of her of you her life like you and me and then they just want like what and he's like we all have demons
1558.8400000000001,1564.3600000000001, And just like I'm scared RIP this don't worry is a demon making you feel that do you want to kick his ass with me?
1566.28,1571.0, What then RIP says what can I shit kicking turn up farmer do to stop the devil himself?
1571.24,1573.24, Can I cast him back into hell
1573.64,1575.64, Then RIP says yes you can cast him in hell
1576.44,1578.2, Uh
1578.76,1581.56, Once you once you've got him out of your life you can walk right
1582.3600000000001,1584.3600000000001, Did not your flesh it read the Bible
1585.0,1590.92, Then this is like a monk yes and pray that races well my cast rod or so I don't have fleshy desires
1592.1200000000001,1594.1200000000001, And RIP says yes
1595.0,1597.72, But there are negative things going on inside of you
1599.0800000000002,1600.68, And this is all going on during this
1602.68,1604.68, Yeah
1604.68,1610.8400000000001," Yeah, and in which people are shooting each other the characters are right people are dying. Yeah, yes, okay"
1610.8400000000001,1613.0, So let's keep ahead I think there's some other good stuff. It says
1615.96,1622.6000000000001, So he brings up a road brings up a sister again and you know if you can deal with her RIP says yes you can learn this and you can do it on other people
1623.88,1627.5600000000002," Um, I'll help you are you ready to kick the demons into hell. Yes, sir"
1628.2,1630.2, Then chef yes
1630.68,1632.68, You can treat those negatives like what they are
1633.32,1635.48," Bo hold on, but oh, or he's"
1636.52,1638.52, Must have heads from laughter
1642.52,1648.1200000000001," Okay, so so roaring and Anthony I just got blown away are these guys we were playing on clean or something"
1648.68,1651.24, RIP they mean business and you must too
1651.56,1655.32, I'm in the business of losing I guess if you want to know more email me
1655.8799999999999,1658.6799999999998, I will be contacting you it will change your life. I'm not lying
1659.24,1662.6799999999998, That rarces will the Lord help us overcome the overwhelming odds in this game
1663.3999999999999,1669.0, Then there's like a lag warning waiting for player RIP to catch up is his lag grace like the grace of the
1669.0,1671.0, Of the Lord
1671.0,1673.0," Then RIP says yes, it is close"
1675.72,1677.72, So that was bad
1678.9199999999998,1682.4399999999998, Wait a second are you saying that you can still barbed wire people into their bases?
1682.76,1686.68, It didn't work what I mean he was able to do his search he was prepared for you
1686.68,1688.2," Yeah, he knew exactly how to counter it"
1689.48,1693.8, How do you counter it you mortar the you mortar the Bob barbed wire to blow it out of the way?
1693.8,1698.1200000000001, But that was the old trick as we tried to get it where you you do it before they can directly we're just
1698.1200000000001,1700.52, Support center up we were and then they can't get the mortar
1701.56,1707.4, But yeah the other thing in your guys is defense that wasn't like I know that wasn't our first encounter with RIP
1707.72,1711.64, We played like many games with them before and and without any provocation
1712.0400000000002,1717.5600000000002, He would start telling people that there were demons in the game or that they that they were possessed by by devils
1718.6000000000001,1722.2800000000002," Though he is pretty good at company here. He's pretty good. Yeah, yeah"
1723.16,1726.0400000000002," He's got got on a side. Yeah, so why does so"
1728.2,1733.72, But it's funny when you do join his game and you're in the lobby waiting to play and if there's anyone that's like got really good stats or something
1733.72,1741.24, You don't in your afraid you start telling RIP because he's the host that that guy's like you you find some way to say that his name is demonic or something
1741.24,1743.88, You're facing oh and you all let him end then they'll kick him
1748.04,1750.04, I'm gonna go to hell when I
1750.28,1753.8," Thank you. Yeah, it doesn't feel so good. You can look over there your bad man"
1755.16,1759.96, Some of some where my my really Catholic grandma with her quite a loop is dead you was crying
1762.92,1764.92, So before we go
1765.4,1773.0," Anthony I have to go we're gonna go over and visit flagship studios to talk about mythos, but we've been playing it over the weekend"
1773.88,1781.4," And are we allowed to talk about that? Yeah, it's like fair totally cool. It's up. Have you been playing it all Brad? No, I haven't"
1782.2,1783.72, It's it's good
1783.72,1785.72, It's the quick rundown on it is that
1787.0800000000002,1792.1200000000001, At some point this is partially what we're gonna go do is could clarify all these rumors
1792.1999999999998,1797.6399999999999, But as I recall it was a small contingent of their team that when they were working on hellgate London
1798.12,1805.4799999999998, Sort of made this side project just as like a sandbox to test certain things and then it kind of emerged as a game in its own right
1806.04,1809.56, And then they decided well this is so much fun and turnily
1809.56,1811.56, We're gonna like see if we can just make this a free game
1812.6,1817.08, That was the last I heard of it then we got into the beta now with the third update
1817.7199999999998,1821.8, And it started playing it and like I don't know about it now we're in to start saying there's
1822.1999999999998,1824.1999999999998, That story doesn't check out
1824.1999999999998,1829.3999999999999," Yeah, just this is this is like a full on game like it's already like even as a beta it feels like"
1829.9599999999998,1833.2399999999998," They could release it right now. Yeah, and it looks good and"
1834.04,1840.12, It seems like I think the batter is like a year ago is that I think they were but I was comparing it to the way it looks now
1840.12,1844.6, Especially to the to the screens and stuff now and it's like now they have people working on on the voice work
1844.6,1850.28," They have yeah, there are this like working on generating you know all the like really you know pretty quality assets"
1851.24,1856.36, They're you know doing illustrations for stuff each you know these new zones and given them a unique character to them
1856.36,1861.48, It just all the work that you did expect in the traditional game so I'm just thinking they started realizing that
1861.96,1866.84," Hey, there's a lot of potential here and everyone I know that's in our group that's playing and you know the five of us"
1866.84,1874.76, I usually hope people are talk about all play it for an hour and then we you know continue to play and they're like if they had released this instead of
1874.76,1880.36," Helgate they would have had a big success on there. I mean, I think Helgates actually successful too"
1880.36,1886.92, But I think that wasn't the main problem with Helgates just it was a little buggy when it came out. I mean right there wasn't the game itself pretty good
1887.72,1893.8799999999999," The game yeah, I mean the game's a 3D Diablo yeah, the game definitely had its moments"
1894.92,1899.48," The bugs were crushing it though, right as the main it was it's almost yeah"
1899.48,1902.28, It's a hard question to answer because the bugs were were so
1902.92,1910.36," Brutal that it made it hard to play enough to tell right I know for us yeah, I was I was kind of enjoying it despite the game"
1910.36,1914.36, I was rushing myself is like okay. I do like the theory of what's going on here
1914.36,1919.76, But then everyone's to why else something just horribly game ending would happen like you'd get four duplicates of a boss
1920.04,1923.28, That internet and I suppose you're supposed to get one you know one version of the boss
1923.28,1925.28," Yeah, that made it harder, right a little bit"
1925.28,1929.3999999999999, I figured that out so it was just like boss is harder than one boss
1929.88,1934.6000000000001, And then they just keep duplicating and then just like what is going on? How did they not catch those and you just get so frustrated?
1934.6000000000001,1939.0, You shut it down and it was just a see it in a mythist. There's like I have an encountered like
1939.88,1946.6000000000001, Any glaring bugs at all and it's only in beta and I think even if we did we'd be more forgiving because it's free
1947.16,1952.1200000000001, And because it's in beta that's part of the thing but there's also I think there's a lot of its perception
1952.1200000000001,1957.4, So that I mean you just have a whole different set of expectations giving me certain stances but the same time
1957.5600000000002,1960.6000000000001, The appearance of it and the aesthetic where's you know how it gate?
1960.8400000000001,1966.0400000000002," I mean, this is pretty cool idea. I guess you know, it's very spawn like spawning or Todd McFarlane"
1966.0400000000002,1970.0400000000002," And I don't think that's for everyone. I mean, it's kind of it's just it's grimey depressing"
1970.52,1975.1200000000001," World just loaded up with to you know, or demons, you know, they're supposed to be gross"
1975.1200000000001,1978.76, So stuff and this is definitely like I mean again
1979.0,1982.2800000000002, Diablo two is this is a remake of it more or less
1982.6000000000001,1985.88, But with a blizzard or a studded look or like or a
1985.88,1991.8000000000002, Crap wrap if you can play world of warcraft from a overhead static 3d like third person can
1991.8000000000002,1996.44, And it's just a lot of craft games because it's that much more you know whimsical and stuff
1996.44,2001.48, I find like I could play like more endurance to play it for for longer periods of time
2001.48,2006.3600000000001, I mean I get that way when you play and I play any kind of really grimey game like condemned to is a recent example
2006.3600000000001,2008.8400000000001, I just can't play those games that long
2009.16,2013.4, It doesn't mean they're bad or anything but that's like there's just so much that's it right you want to go and look at the sun
2013.5600000000002,2015.5600000000002, See some flowers after a while I'm tired of this
2015.8000000000002,2020.3600000000001, Shitty gross so you're happy and like Mario mushroom I am to it's not like that
2020.3600000000001,2024.52, But I think you do I do think that people probably have a lot you know kind of like when you do like color
2024.52,2028.2800000000002, Perception psychology and they test that well what color exactly do you want to paint a doctor's room?
2028.2800000000002,2032.76, What do you want to paint a classroom and you see how long people can sit in any you know given
2033.0800000000002,2034.3600000000001, Vimey I just think it's like that with games
2034.3600000000001,2039.96, I mean if you're gonna be in that kind of environment in a game you're supposed to grind and just play and play and play after a while
2040.44,2045.04, I mean I like I prefer admit those were you go in the sunny valley with pretty pretty
2045.04,2049.32, You can't go into a dark cage and do a dungeon and then you emerge back out
2049.32,2052.2, I've always felt that that was one of the big key reasons for
2052.68,2059.56, Wow's popularity that doesn't get brought up enough the variety the variety and just the general color palette and the general sort of happy
2059.56,2063.8," I'm in Disneyland sort of feeling it has about it. Oh, yeah for sure"
2064.36,2067.8," So they're and this definitely has that yeah, it's shooting forward. I mean again"
2067.8,2071.88, It's not like if if this was a blizzard as they exist now game
2072.1200000000003,2076.36, I mean it would be it would have that much more you know it would be that much more obvious
2076.36,2079.96, It did that they've had all their artists just sit and sweat every detail and make it work
2079.96,2083.48, But it's pretty close it feels like I mean it's a huge star for beta
2083.48,2087.1600000000003, I mean like I said it still feels like really far far far along
2087.6400000000003,2089.2400000000002," Yeah, it does"
2089.2400000000002,2093.96, Did the gameplay I don't know what else to say about other than like the Diablo thing or the straight rest
2094.28,2101.7200000000003," So pretty much kill loot kill loot yeah, but they they have corrected a lot of things in Diablo that may be multiplayer bothered people like"
2102.76,2106.12, Depending on who you play with it'll still become like a loot fest like rushing for loot
2106.28,2111.7200000000003, But since every monster drops lutes for individuals like I'll never see the stuff that drops are
2111.7200000000003,2117.56, John so I don't have to worry about like I can click the blue item the fastest or something like that
2117.96,2123.08, So then if we find something it just encourages us to trade more if we want to actually help each other out
2123.24,2128.2, And I'm surprised that there's already just like a massive variety of like pretty cool things to pick up
2128.2,2132.44, I mean the powers that you use there's like a you know big sizable skill tree
2133.0,2138.36," With multiple tears yeah, but there's tons and tons of like every they get the pacing right again"
2138.36,2141.72, I guess for this kind of game when all this is about is constantly giving you it's like you know
2141.72,2145.96, You're playing 21 or something you know you got to like win once in every five hands to keep playing or
2146.52,2151.56, Something that bothers Kate like hack and slash games for you're just going through and destroying a dungeon real fast
2151.56,2157.48, So it's all the way that say you rank on string and you finish that thought I mean so what it means is that you the pacing for your
2157.48,2162.92, You're leveling up and getting some like nice item or a new weapon or a new spell is like good enough to keep you there
2162.92,2166.68, Where you don't feel like it's it's there. This is taking too long. I'm gonna turn it off
2166.68,2170.92, You know they've got there right so it's all the like that that you would not you would never see much on pixel
2170.92,2172.92, I'll never see which one
2172.92,2177.7999999999997," Both players yeah, that seemed weird because like part of the part of why was the people is you know"
2177.8,2182.44," The jealousy you get when someone else does well get something you're like oh, I want that thing right"
2182.44,2184.28, I guess it's just that one winner group
2184.28,2188.1200000000003, I mean we're just always talking and sharing items. I don't know at least with us
2188.6800000000003,2192.44, Probably because we're friends they work to where we're always coordinating and being like oh
2192.44,2197.0800000000004," You're a wizard because there are items that are very clearly made for each class. Oh, yeah"
2197.2400000000002,2203.7200000000003, Because it's just like they always have like one stat requirement to wear them and since there's only like a very few classes currently in mythos
2203.7200000000003,2205.7200000000003, It's like each stat is really
2205.8799999999997,2211.3199999999997, Class is depending upon a particular stat do we need to go we got a few minutes so you need to like show
2211.56,2216.68, I mean what happens is you end up if you're invent together you brag or you just show it just appears on the screen
2216.68,2221.64, You see someone has got like some giant you know do a wheeling these giant maces or something that are making
2222.04,2226.3599999999997, Huge you know pyro-technic show every time you beat someone with them then you know he got something good
2226.6,2231.08, But I wanted to say about this is that it's created all the stress around our usual
2231.56,2235.72, Usually tightly knit group tightly knit as far as people that do nothing but make fun of each other
2235.72,2238.6," The whole time they're playing games, but we're like we're playing in"
2239.24,2244.6," You know, Rory and Matt and James other guys that we play they're also they they play like Lord of the Rings online"
2244.6,2250.68, And they've generally in the MMOs and stuff and I'm playing with them and I usually don't play that many of these sorts of games
2250.68,2253.24, So it takes me long I get a bunch of stuff and I'm like wait for me guys
2253.24,2257.3199999999997, I got to figure out what I'm gonna throw away and what I can to quit and what I want to do or
2257.6400000000003,2263.48, Or they play more though poops socket and then though they always have to be it's not just because they want they always want to make sure
2263.7200000000003,2268.52, They're at least like two or three levels above everyone else and the whole time they're playing they're bragging about
2268.92,2272.92, Which is weird. It was like this is the kind of people I hate normally in life like did you're bragging to me really
2272.92,2277.48, Because you got this piece of shit like cat capey or when in this stupid ass game
2277.48,2281.48, But they're totally like pulling this the whole time we play they're always running ahead and I'm tagging along
2281.7200000000003,2285.0, Basically walking through an environment. They're just a bunch of fucking bodies looting
2285.56,2287.1600000000003, Really corpses everywhere
2287.16,2292.68, And it's like let me catch up like let me so we can all do the thing and it's kind of like it's frustrating
2292.68,2297.08, I like to play this games where all just this makes sense my ideal world we're going through a dungeon
2297.3999999999996,2301.8799999999997, Everyone's contributing in some way. It's like we need this guy to do this to fight the sentiment. It's not just
2302.7599999999998,2309.08, More like a boss encounter instead of just let's just go through here and click and who's got the the highest stats can just beat up everything first
2309.08,2312.7599999999998," And I got to figure out how to get you in into a law instance. Yeah, that's what I'm saying"
2312.7599999999998,2316.92," Yeah, it is like that when you're around it's exactly all similar level and stuff"
2316.92,2321.88, That's the problem those that you were like level three and they were all like 11 and we were in like a level three dungeons
2321.88,2323.88, They were just blowing everything right right
2324.44,2329.8," Yeah, that happened about two and yeah, exactly when you're like all in an instance and wow together all the same level"
2329.8,2334.2000000000003, It is exactly let's all talk about that one you have to like plan it like what you're about to do yeah
2334.2000000000003,2335.2400000000002, That would be fun
2335.2400000000002,2339.2400000000002, But it's like yeah the whole other thing is just a whole competitive because I don't know I don't I
2339.96,2346.12, I felt a little bit it was enough to keep me playing that's something really feel good when they do that as I think that like that's part of the reason
2346.12,2351.4, They made it where people have their own individual loot because they didn't want necessarily that competitiveness over
2351.7999999999997,2355.8399999999997, Who is getting what but I guess I don't know I think the competitiveness is always gonna be there
2355.8399999999997,2359.16, What it's gonna change that was this the actual fighting over?
2359.16,2364.6, That's who who scored the item it's like basically in that kind of a model that you're describing
2364.6,2368.96, It's like a berry bonds like home run ball every like time you kill a monster
2369.12,2374.7599999999998," You know, well, you have different class items like if you have you know just one major with your an image on and drops other people seeing it is"
2374.76,2378.0400000000004," Kind of nice just because you can kind of go. Oh, hey good job, and there's that other"
2378.0400000000004,2384.0400000000004, Other level where it's not competitive. It's just like there is also like a lottery some incentive to not give items to players though
2384.1200000000003,2391.0400000000004, Like because the whole game has a really cool crafting system where everyone no matter your class can craft items
2391.5600000000004,2398.48, And then you just pick a like it's kind of like in wow when you end up like doing armor specialization or something or like your blacksmith
2398.48,2400.6800000000003, And then you specialize in armor hammers or something
2400.8399999999997,2407.64, So in this you specialize like I'm a good a class these are rifle so I specialize in the one that takes me down like a rifle tier
2408.12,2412.16, And everyone has to use all these ingredients that are constantly dropping as well
2413.16,2415.64, But you can also like break magic items
2416.04,2422.4199999999996," Intangredients for crafting as well, so there is some discouragement from wanting to give all the amazing items because if you can't use it"
2422.4199999999996,2426.7999999999997," You're like well, I'll get like a really good and champ it really yeah exactly you'll get like a really good disenchanted from it"
2427.2,2428.2, So
2428.2,2435.24, My final note on that is it's not fun when I I love love and I want to be all excited guys catching up guys
2435.24,2438.3599999999997, And then they're just like cool. There's a spider over there. Go beat on it when we beat these others
2439.16,2443.3599999999997," Yeah, you don't be just mad at your friend. You're not mad at the game"
2443.3599999999997,2445.3999999999996, I thought I thought we'd love to be no
2445.3999999999996,2450.52, Consumant has nothing it's it's all I just wanted to call them out right now to think if we start playing now
2450.52,2455.8999999999996, We'll be the noobs and you'll be the king you'll be like the one to be the king because that's like I don't
2455.9,2459.94, Feel do you want to be king of the returns level love you can myth us
2461.3,2466.94, Show me what it's go shot. That's worse all those games are the best when you're all the same level playing together
2467.54,2470.94," Yeah, some some games Final Fantasy 11 in particular"
2471.46,2474.42, Enforced so much that people would kick out anyone not
2475.02,2480.7000000000003, The exact same level as you like if you do we're all 17 and all of a sudden one person hit 18 and they're like get out of here
2480.7000000000003,2483.02, Because you'd recognize that's really it was horrible
2483.2599999999998,2488.6," So yeah, I recommend I think you I think everyone when it hits open beta"
2488.6,2494.48," I would recommend it to anyone that even some right now. It's a close beta free. Yeah, yeah"
2495.5,2497.44, Come back with the scoop. Yeah
2497.44,2503.04, I just want to find out how they're gonna monetize it in some way like they should so we're gonna go find out right now head over there
2503.04,2509.48," All right, so yes, sorry didn't get to be be part of the focus on Brad part, but"
2510.12,2512.12, Part two ask him as I won
2512.12,2516.16," Yeah, yeah, I do have any questions on ask him on your way out before you agree"
2516.16,2520.48, Last time I want to know all about you know the future of start-off and just the whole
2521.52,2524.24, You know you know all my publishing and the
2525.04,2526.24, How it's like it really
2527.04,2532.44, Just a little like you're purely pornography demographic material and content it's all false
2533.24,2536.3199999999997, And also just the general is your your thoughts on the state
2536.3199999999997,2538.64, I mean since it's been such a big topic this year
2538.64,2544.7799999999997," Yeah, I didn't go to GDC this year. What was the deal there? I mean after GDC everyone was talking about the game"
2544.7799999999997,2548.18, And it just three years. I mean usually every month or so on quarter to three
2548.18,2553.48," There's a you know PC gaming's doomed article, but this year gained developers conference there must have been like what's"
2553.48,2555.8799999999997, Is it like a Jim Jones type moment there?
2555.8799999999997,2559.6, What I don't know just all of a sudden it was like a big topic rather than than
2560.3199999999997,2566.72," We came down number 977. Yeah, we came back Jeff and I joke people like so what did you see we were like Jeff's like"
2566.72,2570.68, I went to room 247 heard creepy being announced the death PC games and it's like oh
2570.68,2575.2999999999997," Well, I was over and you know we just kept name going through and name the different you know history figures don't sit"
2575.2999999999997,2576.3399999999997, Tell us that
2576.3399999999997,2580.64, That PC gaming was dead. So I was happy that little fit made it onto the one-up show
2580.64,2585.2599999999998, I think that the success of sins. I mean what what other sorts of games?
2585.2599999999998,2591.64, You know where's the R.O.C. going especially and how specifically you guys are picking you know the games that sure that sure
2591.8799999999997,2596.68," Yeah, I mean the game industry is evolving. I mean, I mean, I'm a liking to think that what they"
2596.68,2600.64, Really mean it's a de game industry's evolving from the old model. I mean the old days
2601.0,2606.2799999999997, You made a PC game you found a publisher to give you because Zoons of dollars upfront as an advanced
2606.3999999999996,2610.56, Then you never saw another penny for it and the game came out you should little buggy
2610.7599999999998,2618.0, You put out a patch and then an expansion pack and then you moved on and that model is just not competitive anymore
2618.0,2624.7999999999997, I mean the cost of making a tripoy game or too high to make that happen and in the nature of World Warcraft
2624.8,2628.44, You can't what you say AAA game what do you mean Brad?
2628.44,2630.44, Do you mean in terms of
2630.44,2633.76, monetary value or what I'm talking purely in cost?
2633.76,2638.96," Okay, yeah, I mean if you're if you're game costs millions of millions of dollars to make the PC game"
2639.2400000000002,2645.26, Market North America there is a hard limit on how many titles how many copies you can sell and this is not an unknown
2645.6000000000004,2650.1800000000003, Unknown item and that's one of the things that I find really frustrating when people talk well
2650.54,2656.18, Piracy's eating it or this other things eating it and it's like well these NPD figures are available
2656.18,2663.2, You can find out how much how many copies of these various titles have sold and yet people will make a game that requires
2663.8599999999997,2666.8999999999996, You know quad core processor with a half gig
2667.62,2669.62, You know shader three
2669.62,2673.8599999999997, Video card run and then be shocked that they don't aren't selling as many copies as they'd like
2674.8999999999996,2679.7799999999997, But this is a question I keep I've been asking for many months now and
2680.18,2686.8999999999996, I'm just wondering if the concept of what is a blockbuster now has shifted to a point where
2687.3799999999997,2693.2999999999997, That where the failure is almost you know a pre ordained thing when it comes to PC
2693.74,2697.14, Titles like it seems to me like in the old days what we used to consider a kit
2697.7799999999997,2702.6," Was a lot smaller about 100,000 units or so right was a huge hit and the thing is"
2702.98,2708.18, I don't know how that happened. It's sort of like a you all got you all played cumbersome 64 games right in the day
2708.5,2712.5," And in your mind you can remember like oh, yeah, I remember playing"
2712.5,2716.58, You know load runner and we're great. I'm bugging like bay and a graphics for photo real holistic
2716.58,2720.62, I remember it that way and then you see it you're getting an emulator and you go oh my gosh
2720.62,2726.7799999999997, This is terrible. It's sort of like that with the the PC game stats because the NPD stats you can go and look the top
2727.94,2730.74, 100 games best selling games of all time didn't sell
2731.4599999999996,2738.02, Gizzouines of units. I mean others in a handful most of them are not sold over a million units right so it makes me wonder if it's not like
2738.8999999999996,2740.8999999999996, I don't because I don't believe it's dying
2740.8999999999996,2747.4599999999996, So that it's dying. It's just like they keep thinking that they're gonna get they meaning the publishers of PC games
2747.4599999999996,2753.02, I think in that they're gonna get the same kind of numbers that they might get at a GTA 4 or something else
2753.18,2760.3399999999997," Well, I don't feel like that's ever been the case right they never they've never gotten those kinds of numbers and yet people and"
2760.74,2767.66, Me personally if I spend I'm I'm I'm not a real game developer. I'm just a gamer who happens to be decent at business
2767.66,2768.66, I
2768.66,2774.8999999999996, Try to make games that cost less to create than they generate in revenue
2775.62,2781.7," This is radical, but let me repeat it so if the game costs X to make I want it to make"
2782.02,2784.8999999999996, Y back where why it's greater than X
2784.9799999999996,2786.9799999999996, That's what we try to do here at GFW
2787.62,2792.22," We try to spend enough money so that when we sell our like 4,000 copies"
2792.5,2796.58," That's actually a profit that's that's that's the dream. We have 4,000"
2798.58,2801.54," Oh, jeezing advertising pricing is a little bit off"
2803.06,2809.62," Don't talk to us about that. Are we charging a lot for ads in our magazine? Yes, really? Yeah more than the other"
2810.18,2813.86, PC publication really same space. You think we wouldn't be having that strategy
2813.86,2818.1800000000003," What would the whole chapter 11 thing you think it'd be sort of like fire sale? Yeah? Well, no"
2818.7400000000002,2823.94, Five ads for a dollar that whole thing is just so they can get your creditors and become stockholders anyway
2823.94,2825.94, It's not a real chapter 11 right
2826.9,2828.9, I don't know anything about that
2829.3,2832.6600000000003," More than we do yeah, we know we're not business people here. That's why we work on a man"
2832.6600000000003,2835.94," No, it was as if Davis owned a lot of stuff because of the old"
2836.42,2842.98," What's it the soft? Oh, who the soft bank soft bank thing and so instead of having to credit having all the profits"
2843.06,2846.02, Constantly going to paying off debt they just turn them into
2847.06,2850.58, Owners of the company to do that they're having a bankruptcy court take care of it
2850.58,2856.18, So it's not right it's not because of Davis is dying or anything. It's just a convenient way to
2857.38,2860.18, Turn creditors into stockholders. Thank you for telling you
2860.7400000000002,2862.7400000000002, So you think we'll stop job
2864.7400000000002,2866.7400000000002," No, the plan that's any better"
2866.7400000000002,2870.42," Yeah, no, yeah, I think everything's gonna be fine. Thanks, Brad cool"
2871.06,2877.94, Glad so what do you consider like a successful game then if you are you talking just well generally
2877.94,2882.98, If if you beat that equation you're talking about has to be profitable has and I mean
2883.7000000000003,2889.78, It's obviously I don't in a lot people I were over at a bunch of articles and response to what my anti-pire
2889.78,2893.38, Piracy article and perivers saying well is he saying that you just had to make casual games is like
2893.94,2898.02, I don't think anyone that can say since the sole empire is some sort of puzzle game more
2898.2599999999998,2902.66, I mean we are talking about a game that's made millions and millions of dollars in the first 45 days
2902.66,2903.86, It was out
2903.86,2906.66," That's yeah, and that's a successful game if it's making"
2907.22,2911.14, Two three four times more than it took to make it that's successful
2911.7,2917.86, So so in your eyes clearly and it sounds like it is since those of a solar empire is a success
2917.86,2922.18," Yeah, but let's say it's the exact same game that it is now, but"
2923.14,2928.5," I'm not I'm just throwing you seems out just random, but let's say you know, it's published instead by"
2928.74,2931.7799999999997, Activision or EA or Ubisoft or whoever
2932.3399999999997,2937.7, They went up position is it in hit but if they did is it a hit to them too? Do you think I don't know?
2937.7,2941.06, I know that a few years ago when Atari came to us and they wanted us to
2941.62,2944.8199999999997, Do master magic and start control four and a bunch of other things
2945.7799999999997,2950.4199999999996, They didn't want to be bothered with it because they didn't take it with cell million units and they wanted to only focus on titles
2950.7400000000002,2955.54," Like it's like a million units, so would they consider the successful game? I'm not sure"
2957.46,2962.98," Yeah, it's I think that you had to make such a huge threshold of gross revenue with them"
2963.38,2967.46, We're putting aside the net. I think they're more focused on gross than net
2967.86,2972.26, This is my whole problem is that is that that if you're only gonna be focused on gross
2972.82,2978.9, Then PC gaming can't win right but it never would have been able to going all the way back to the 80s
2979.06,2983.38, Right but how long in the 80s were those companies publicly traded companies?
2984.1800000000003,2986.58, Right versus now where it's on stock
2986.58,2991.2200000000003, I'm you know stockholders want to see the gross revenue going up look they reported blah blah blah
2991.2200000000003,2994.1800000000003, with gazoons and sales right I mean start off has a huge
2994.58,2997.94, Profit margin I should say I mean we're struggling please so by our game but
2999.06,3008.02, But our gross is puny compared to other companies. I mean right so it's it's all depends on what you're going for and I've seen this over and over again
3008.5,3015.38, Companies want to have huge gross revenue and not worry so much about the net and that's just what it's just
3016.58,3022.82, Totally a sort of frustration for me is that if if a game company or publisher could it's be happy with
3023.7,3028.5, Certain amount of profit based on a certain amount of sales that's actually based on reality
3029.38,3036.18," Yeah, other than on some mythic millions of sales just because world of warcraft happens to get it or the scent or the sins"
3036.5,3042.74, You know you've got two franchises here that have gone so far stratophatically out of the realm of
3043.06,3047.2999999999997, Normality that to think that you're going to be able to duplicate that is just to me
3047.8599999999997,3050.8199999999997, ludicrous right they're not the norm they're the anomaly and
3051.7,3058.18, It is it's one of the things about the polygothry companies. They just don't seem to care about making profit as much as they are
3058.66,3060.66, Genreening gross revenue right
3061.62,3065.62, How does the digital distribution play into the number because one of the
3066.18,3070.3399999999997, Quentin quipe excuses you often here is like well you look at MPD numbers and maybe those aren't so high
3070.3399999999997,3076.3399999999997, But you're not counting all the digital distributions. That's true. I mean we've we've made more money on digital distributing
3077.14,3081.2999999999997, Since the soil empire then we have it retail so far does that mean you've sold more copies that way
3082.02,3086.5, It's pretty close. I don't know we make twice as much from you know over digital than we do at retail
3086.5,3090.66, Because there's no middleman right exactly so it's but it's pretty close
3090.66,3094.8999999999996, We've sort of a lot of copies direct and those numbers are not showing up
3095.2200000000003,3100.5," All right, they don't count right. MPD doesn't count Walmart. I don't think either and that's where we've sold"
3100.5,3106.9, I think the most copies of of sins at retail is a Walmart so to NPD or sales must look like shit
3106.9,3110.1, Why would they not between Walmart and not sure why they don't I don't know
3110.6600000000003,3114.82, I don't know why NPD how do you an interesting thing to ask them that's kind of like isn't that the biggest
3116.7400000000002,3118.7400000000002, Selling they're pretty important
3119.14,3122.1800000000003, From a statistical point of view though it doesn't matter right I mean
3122.3399999999997,3128.98," Everyone you assume that all the major publishers are at Walmart anyway, so if you're just if you're taking a sample from Best Buy and"
3128.98,3132.18, E.B and and Circuit City and whatnot
3132.66,3136.8999999999996, Then you probably have a good idea of the order to and then if everything else is equal because I mean
3136.8999999999996,3141.8599999999997, I've seen a Piotalking about well since may have been at the top of NPD's chart last month
3141.8599999999997,3144.18, But that's because they don't count digital's like well
3144.8999999999996,3149.54, That you know if we kind of ditch it'll we would probably have been number one then because we you know sell so many
3150.5,3155.14, So I bet that that's you mentioned Walmart and I remember when I think if Gelsive two
3155.62,3160.1, Maybe not dark avatar but the dreadlords came out that was number one at Walmart. It's first week right
3160.1,3165.38, Yeah for first month for month February. It was the number one game at Walmart. How did that happen
3165.94,3167.94, There was a game called master Ryan three
3168.34,3174.1," Came out and you'll I remember that yeah, do you how well do you remember it? I remember I did not like it. Yeah well"
3174.66,3176.66, So that game came out and
3177.54,3182.3399999999997, There was a flyer in the box for Gelsive two in the master Ryan three box
3182.3399999999997,3184.98, So when it showed about Walmart all these people went
3185.38,3190.74, Went and bought Gelsive and that's the biggest reason I think really. Yeah. Wow Wow
3190.74,3192.74, So thank you your turn
3192.74,3197.46," Yeah, we thanks for yeah master Ryan three basically made Gelsive two wow"
3198.42,3201.86, Or actually no I might think that Gelsive two Gelsive one. I'm getting I'm all
3202.82,3208.1800000000003," Yeah, this Gelsive one Gelsive one was much closer to move. Yeah, it was a Gelsive one that took that took off"
3208.1800000000003,3212.34, But uh but in terms of Gelsive two I think it was just a kind of a follow on the once we had
3212.7400000000002,3217.1400000000003, Basically the user the player base for a master Ryan had kind of shifted to
3217.46,3222.5,�o accusations because of the move three thing and then when Gelsive two came in on and a built-in audience
3223.3,3229.54, It's just I mean you know what I like stereotype users or or assume who's buying what where but that should do sure you do
3229.7799999999997,3237.06," Okay, so you do all right. I'm doing it you don't think that that Walmart would be the place where you find your most active Gelsive"
3237.38,3241.86, Two fanbase no no and I want to think is that it's all relative though it's uh
3243.06,3248.58," Yeah, I couldn't explain either. I'm what now when a bliving came out it totally you know"
3248.58,3254.02, Kick Gelsive off the off the top of the charts easily because and that's a totally different game because
3254.18,3259.22, Blibians sold like gangbusters at Walmart but I believe it also I mean like as far as I remember
3259.22,3261.22, Like those TV advertising
3261.38,3264.82," It was a much more mainstream game in a way yeah, the goal suit two"
3265.3,3267.62, Those teams of all things like that game
3267.94,3272.02, I'd like to I haven't seen the stats at Walmart for sins that like to see how well it's doing it
3272.02,3273.54," Right, because I know that"
3273.54,3278.5, Since it sold way better at Walmart than Gelsive since it's beaten Gelsive two and sales by a huge margin
3278.5,3283.3, Which as a you know designer Gelsive two's kind of a mixed stuff feeling about the hat
3284.5,3289.3, Now when you first came around with with sins. I mean it was clear that that you knew it as
3289.3,3293.14, Publisher that you had something good in your hands. I mean going back a long time ago
3293.14,3295.14, You were you were pretty high on the game
3295.3,3299.86, But now that it's out and it's gotten their reviews it's had and it's done the sales it's done
3300.34,3301.54, I mean has
3301.54,3303.78, Did has it exceedy your expectations?
3303.78,3307.78," Yeah, I mean our expectations were that it would do a bonus well as collect"
3307.78,3310.2599999999998, Sultices two at best because it was a new title
3310.7400000000002,3316.42, New developer I mean ironclad at Nermate a game before the I mean a team at the team members had worked on other games
3316.42,3321.38, But ironclad self hadn't and it was fourth quarter members for it's quarters a little bit busy
3321.5400000000004,3325.6200000000003, So it was very hard to get preview coverage so we were very nervous and then it came out
3325.6200000000003,3334.0200000000004, It's just I think it's selling at around 1.6 or 1.7 times collect civilizations rate did which is pretty huge considering a Gelsive two was
3334.82,3336.1000000000004, Pretty successful
3336.1000000000004,3338.1000000000004, So how do you how do you decide
3338.58,3343.06, Like you said ironclad that never made a game before how do you decide that this is these are the guys you want to go with
3343.62,3347.2999999999997, Well with the in their case we got talking we talked them a long time and
3348.02,3352.8199999999997, We were I mean start off when we decided to get into publishing we had a couple things we want to do differently
3352.8199999999997,3358.02, Then the traditional publishing arrangement that is one is we wanted to integrate our teams together
3358.02,3362.42, And we so we talked them a long time about that about making sure that they are open to
3363.14,3370.5, We would be part of their game development process and they would be part of our marketing process so that we could fill any holes and they seemed very open to that
3371.06,3373.38, And I remember when I was first playing the game
3373.38,3378.58," They had the empire tree that thing on the left side. Yeah, that was so revolutionary. Oh my god"
3378.58,3383.2200000000003, These guys are geniuses. I mean did it scare you at first because I think that was our reaction was like
3383.86,3389.62, I don't know what to make of that because I haven't only seen this for however long I get a demo for and it looks really scary
3389.62,3392.8199999999997, And then obviously now in the screenshots it's scared to heck out of me
3392.8199999999997,3395.22, But when I start playing I went oh my god
3395.22,3402.58, Why did I think of this and then secondly how can I steal this without anyone knowing I stole it and then I realized I'm saying that on a podcast and it's being reported
3403.7,3407.94," Well, we would all steal it to if we were making it I think you're allowed right? Yeah, yeah"
3408.58,3410.58, Anyone it
3412.42,3415.7799999999997," But hey, I want to hear about political machine 2008. All right"
3416.02,3419.78," Well, let's see we're doing political machine 2008 which is a strategy game"
3419.78,3424.02, the CGW liked it back in the back in the day we did we did and
3425.3,3430.26, The 2008 version far far better. We've taken we've learned a lot from we have a fantasy strategy
3430.26,3433.5400000000004," Again, that's a development and we that's because it's a land-based game"
3433.5400000000004,3435.94, We had to develop this new 3D engine so
3436.5,3438.1000000000004, We took that engine and we
3438.9,3442.42, Real put a machine with it so it's kind of a rewrite from what we had before
3442.9,3446.1, So all your characters are truly 3D can design them yourself
3446.1,3453.06, So if you want to have Obama or Clinton or you know McCain you can have them in there or make your own characters and I mean
3453.46,3457.46, Control how big their head is what clothes are wearing put glass. I mean it's almost like sport
3458.1,3460.1, Type design you have creatures
3460.66,3465.94," Don't know if I guess it would be creatures as your politicians, but you know their politicians that you're designing here too"
3467.14,3469.7000000000003, And they go off and now start campaigning around the country
3470.66,3475.2999999999997, I've got to say the whole idea of custom creation like that when I first picked up
3476.58,3482.74, The second galce of expansion there was a custom enemy feature right and I totally dismissed it first again
3482.74,3488.4199999999996, Whatever that just thrown in there. I spent more time with that thing than almost with any other aspect of that game
3488.58,3493.54, Just making my own life well we're finishing up 12 out of the honor which is the second expansion pack and in that
3493.62,3497.7799999999997, This was really a dumb idea in hindsight because it was way more work than we realized
3498.34,3505.3, Every race gets their own tech tree and it's not just cosmetic. I mean they get their own tech tree their own text and so
3505.46,3511.38, When you create your own custom enemies now you can mix and match like tech trees and I'll get them their own tech tree and everything too
3511.7000000000003,3516.1000000000004, Can you make a tech tree from scratch or do you pick it comes with a editor to make your own tech tree? Oh god
3516.1000000000004,3520.7400000000002, I know it's because this is the last dog. This is last expansion pack we're doing for galce of two
3521.1400000000003,3523.5400000000004, So when we release it it's kind of be just
3524.1000000000004,3527.5400000000004, In saying I can't I don't we just no way we can cost just if I it's just sort of like
3527.86,3535.3, Here you go here's I think it comes with like seven editors so you can basically you want to do your own expansion packs or do your own stuff
3535.46,3540.1800000000003, Here you go go nuts and it's where they're in a very polished the ex um the editors are so you can go
3540.7400000000002,3542.7400000000002, Crazy and make your own races and your own
3543.3,3547.0600000000004, Units and that I mean just go out nuts with it. So is there anything
3547.86,3550.1800000000003, This is the last expansion that you
3551.1400000000003,3556.42, Still wanted to do if like if you could make one more expansion like would you that you wanted to add that you hope maybe the community
3556.5,3560.58," You're gonna oh I would have yeah, there's some there's some some stuff"
3560.58,3564.5, I would I would like to have added multiplayer in right at some point
3565.06,3566.34, I think that's the one everyone
3566.34,3571.94, Tactical about tactical battles. I mean that's what is sequo if we do a sequel to galce if there's a galce of three
3571.94,3577.62, Oh have multiplayer. I don't have tactical battles and I don't know for me I like to computer AI
3577.62,3583.3, That's what I'm working on and it's so I'm always looking to make the AI more sophisticated and then that sort of thing
3584.26,3589.7000000000003, But it won't be getting back to that we won't be getting back to galce if we won't be a galce of three for years and years
3589.7000000000003,3595.3, So we got fancy strategy game. We still got a finished society that which is the the RTS
3595.86,3597.86, MMO kind of game
3597.86,3600.26, I don't know if you guys remember mentioned that like 10 years ago
3600.26,3602.98, We just could think we need to pull over a publicized would be on the vaporware
3604.02,3606.42, What's that I didn't you remember that gem? I don't remember that
3606.98,3612.42," Yeah, that's a large scale RTS type game and so we still have to finish that one"
3612.66,3616.5, Then we can look back and of course we have our games that we're publishing that's
3617.3,3621.06, I'm gonna keep us busy for a while so you've now mentioned twice this
3621.54,3624.9, Fantasy strategy game which of course we hear of her love
3625.54,3630.9," Yes, in past discussions, but we haven't talked about it since you brought it up here twice now this time"
3630.9,3632.58, I mean you're right to talk about it
3632.9,3640.1," We can talk about it. I mean I can't get caught by name yet, but doesn't have one or just it's not official it's it's not official yet"
3640.5,3642.1, But
3642.1,3648.66, We have next this Monday we're gonna be announcing a major new game. We're gonna be publishing and so that'll probably be coming up February
3648.66,3651.7, And then the fancy strategy game will come out the following February
3651.7,3653.46, So we have all extended
3653.46,3657.38," Beta program, but the fancy strategy game could be best described as kind of like"
3658.5,3660.5, Master of magic like
3660.98,3663.62, But in this you're actually you design your own units
3664.1,3669.46, You have all kinds of cool spells and and when you want to the cool features is that when you zoom out
3669.62,3677.2200000000003, The map becomes like a cloth map like and draw the rings so you then you can zoom all the way out or zoom all the way in and see individual leaves on trees and
3679.06,3683.14, Players can actually create their own content and then submit it and then once they go into moderation
3683.14,3687.2200000000003, They're available to all players within the game so you're not having to go on to the web and download stuff
3687.62,3689.62, It's actually part of the game
3690.02,3692.02, So it's it terms of
3692.02,3694.02, self
3694.02,3696.02, Expanding
3696.98,3705.22," a little bit though. I mean we were working on this long long time ago, but I've always been a big believer in letting the players be part of the creation process as much as you can"
3705.62,3707.46, I mean there's some really cool
3707.62,3712.5," Babylon five and Star Trek mods for Clip Sosations where you know, you know, you know, you're playing the"
3712.82,3714.98, Membori versus the earth lions or whatever
3714.98,3716.98, I did stuff like that myself
3718.18,3720.18, I did not make any of those mods
3720.18,3722.66, My own personal ones so so to
3723.22,3724.02, Old-time
3724.02,3725.62, Master of magic fans
3726.1,3728.1, Can they consider this some kind of uh
3728.74,3730.1, you know
3730.1,3736.74, Like game a spiritual follow-up if you will so well along those lines or it's not a it's definitely not a master magic clone
3737.78,3742.82, Because there is so much I mean there's so many new game mechanics that we've been able to add in because of
3743.14,3746.1, The technology coming has come a long way but let for example
3747.14,3749.86, Because it's of the 3D engine which they didn't have back then
3750.42,3757.38, The when you start out the map you start out a world that's been totally devastated and as you you pick whether you're good or evil
3757.46,3762.5, If you're good the your as your territory goes out it comes back to life and you see you know plants and
3762.82,3766.7400000000002, Trees growing and flowers and it just looks really pretty if you're evil
3766.98,3770.98, Of course it looks like more door and it's just you know becomes really nasty and
3771.54,3774.1, Scary looking as it expands into the world too
3774.5,3776.58, Whereas you couldn't do that back in the 80s where
3776.9,3783.54, Or 90s I should say because you couldn't do that kind of texture mapping on to the onto a 3D surface like that
3785.2999999999997,3788.8199999999997, Turn based turn based tactical combat multiplayer
3789.7,3795.06, Turn based because the like that's that's your thing is that I just like games where you're not fling rushed
3795.06,3798.02, I mean we want I want people to be a really enjoy
3798.58,3803.94, When they're whether going into a battle or or picking a spell that they want to cast I want them to be able to
3804.42,3806.82, Choose it without being rushed at all
3807.38,3812.98, So I know you work directly on your own games and you'd see you and a million other things
3812.98,3818.66, So what what exactly do you what's your responsibility in coding? Are you like I am a master I am the AI guy
3818.66,3820.9, I code all start-ups computer-eyes
3821.14,3825.3," So collect associations, blue machine corporate machine. That's all you yep"
3826.18,3831.3, Is there ever been a point at which you yourself or a loved one or whatever has said
3831.7000000000003,3837.2200000000003, On you stop doing that part of the job. No like run the business. I mean could you at this point?
3838.26,3842.98," Yeah, I don't know computer AI is pretty tricky. I mean it's one of the most common things people bring up in"
3843.78,3848.1000000000004, In your reviews is that the AI isn't any good and there's it takes I mean I've been doing it for
3848.9,3856.5, 15 years now and so I have a reasonable understanding of how to write AI that's gonna provide a good challenge without massively cheating against the player
3856.5,3858.5, And I'd like it. I really enjoy
3859.46,3865.22," For me, I always design a when I design a game. It's I'm considering well how would the AI be able to play this game as well?"
3866.1,3872.26, So how do you test something because I know the twilight or the iron ore pack has like an immense galaxy size?
3872.82,3878.9, How and I played a little bit around with it just like see how big it was and I was just thinking how do you even test this thing?
3878.9,3881.22, I know well that's where you have the public betas
3882.1,3886.42, That's that's that's that's start like sturdy little secret right we we put out a
3886.82,3892.1800000000003, Weeks have a longer gestation rate because we'll have an open beta and letting people preorder the game
3892.42,3896.66, Then they can play it and they'll tell us what things we need to balance for what things they don't like and
3897.46,3901.46," You know, I pretty much just hang it on the forms reading what they what they say and"
3901.78,3906.42," Trying to make a judgment on whether okay is that reasonable or is that you know, are they are they crazy?"
3907.06,3910.58, And trying to implement what makes sense into the game because yeah
3910.8199999999997,3917.2999999999997, Into it with twilight iron ore with every race having its own tech technology tree which means every race has its own planetary improvements its own
3917.86,3924.34, Ships and I that was the problem we didn't really think through the ramifications of giving every race its own tech tree because I like
3924.34,3927.62," Oh, which is give every race its own tech tree how hard can that be that's not that hard"
3927.94,3933.94, Then it's but it's the fact that everything all the things your race gets are based on the tech tree
3934.42,3940.26, We had to go in and design literally hundreds of new planetary improvements which meant new graphics for all
3940.26,3942.9, I'm because you can't just go and reuse the same ones. I'll be laying
3943.54,3948.26, So so do you have any on-step QA or is it just pretty much you know now?
3948.26,3952.98," No, we have a QA department because my word start. I also has the non-game side of the company"
3952.98,3957.78," Oh, yeah, yeah, and so we already have a pretty serious QA side because of that we do a lot work with the"
3957.78,3959.78, OEMs and with Microsoft and stuff
3959.78,3963.86," Well, I mean you have like a more in QA in terms of play balancing in terms of all"
3963.94,3970.1, Play balancing now the that's mostly beta and us and on the games team in terms of what we like to do and stuff
3970.7400000000002,3975.46, I mean if you have the guy doing the AI also doing the one you know putting in the numbers for stuff
3976.42,3978.9, It's usually not too hard to balance it reasonably well
3979.62,3983.06, Especially with the multiplayer I mean it's what the doubts if we're up to you
3984.34,3988.42, There's no way we had tried to do a try if you are not as a multiplayer game because you imagine
3988.7400000000002,3993.62, bouncing 12 to imagine civilization for if the Mongols and the
3994.58,3999.62, You know and the Romans each had their own tech tree try you'd have so many complaints like what do you mean?
3999.62,4003.14, You know ironworking is way tougher than bone
4003.78,4010.34," Shape being your yeah, that's right. They all they have are there there to some advantages at the beginning of the match right right"
4011.2200000000003,4014.5, Fairly minor really exact whereas here there are
4014.9,4019.78, full hundred plus technology tree differences per race is is crazy
4020.58,4021.78, Lot of writing
4021.78,4027.54, Lot of crazy the worst part actually is fixing all the typos really yeah because you got to go through
4028.02,4032.18," Hundreds of pages of text and yeah, but if it's like typos of like"
4032.66,4034.42, Alien technology who the hell would know
4035.3,4040.42," Well, it's you all had a third a the what will save room so when you guys are doing the review"
4040.66,4046.02," Yeah, do you see a typo just say that was a translation of the from the native language right"
4047.14,4050.66, How high on your kind of priority list is typos in terms of bugs?
4051.62,4053.7000000000003, They just don't easy to fix if you see a window go fix it
4053.7000000000003,4056.98, We we take them prayer fairly serious because we'll get you get ready
4056.98,4061.78," They show reviewers will bring them up. Yes, and so well, it's one thing we understand"
4062.42,4068.34, A misplaced word is something that we as magazine people right all lazy they didn't even fix that
4068.6600000000003,4069.6200000000003," Yeah, what you know"
4069.6200000000003,4072.82, We're just not real good with letters and numbers is our main problem
4073.06,4078.42, I remember lurking this is back to the play testing and beta phase. I remember lurking on the
4079.1400000000003,4084.9, Sims forums and seeing some people suggest things offhand and then there'll be a post from one of the
4084.9,4088.7400000000002," Frasers saying oh yeah, we just changed that just for you know and they pretty much acknowledge it was"
4089.2200000000003,4092.98," Yeah, because you guys just now said that and we're like yeah, that's really cool and then"
4093.6200000000003,4095.2200000000003, to me that's like whoa
4095.2999999999997,4100.179999999999," Yep, I have power over over over what the developers are going to do and that seems very strange to me"
4100.179999999999,4105.3," Well, I mean the ideas see the ideas should make a game and here's a tricky tricky part"
4105.3,4108.66, You then sell it to people who want to play the game
4108.74,4113.3," Okay, and so if you make the people who buy your game happy they are even more likely to buy your next game"
4113.94,4119.46, So you know creating goodwill and it is it's we want to be some tricky work done there on your side of like
4119.78,4123.78," Weeding out you know the cranks. Oh, almost of the stuff we ignore"
4123.86,4129.46," Yeah, I mean, I'm a jerk so I pretty much go what are you talking about are you in saying you know"
4129.62,4133.7, There's a lot of people who are mad about and since the soil empire you don't have turrets
4134.5,4139.46, You know the ships don't actually have little guns at point and and shoot and have physics to them
4139.46,4144.74, And it's like guys do you want to have to require a dual-core to play this game because that you'd have to I mean the hardware
4144.74,4150.34, Requires would be astronomical to do that but there were still people who said it would be worth it and it's like well
4150.66,4154.58, Clearly we don't agree on that so there's a lot of stuff like that and of course there's
4155.3,4158.82, Every time we do an update there's plenty of people think we've ruined the game
4158.82,4161.06, It's the end of the world because now it's completely
4161.62,4165.3, Bounced against whoever their race was or whatever their tactic was before
4165.3,4167.3," Oh, yeah, you hear that"
4167.3,4174.82," For the next 900 years is you're patching anything exactly. Yeah, I know and we already have the next three updates still you know in the queue for going so"
4175.62,4181.299999999999, Don't be a lot angst to spread out as the spring and summer come along. Do you lose sleep over the angst? No
4182.259999999999,4186.98, We did yeah and glad associations we would get really a little bit
4186.98,4193.46, Discourge when we put out an update that would really work tart on it and it'd be like hundreds of features and people would fixate on some
4193.54,4195.219999999999, Pidley little thing and
4195.38,4199.54, There would be ten posts about how it's destroyed the game that because we did such and such you know
4199.54,4201.54, Was something that doesn't even come up
4201.54,4203.54, But over time you realize that
4204.1,4208.82, You start noticing that's really like five or six people who are writing all the posts and they just repeat it
4209.22,4211.86, But if you're just casually going through the forums you go wow
4212.5,4219.06," There's a lot of people hate such and such and you realize oh, it's not the same guy it's the vocal minority right repetitive vocal minority"
4221.38,4223.38, So you guys see yourself
4223.38,4229.78, Mainly as like the strategy house or you see yourself branching out. I'd like to see us doing RPG
4230.099999999999,4232.58," I mean, I'm I'm I'm dying for another"
4233.139999999999,4238.74, Ballter skater plan escaped torment and so if if by aware or whoever doesn't make one pretty soon
4239.219999999999,4246.099999999999, We're gonna look at naked starting getting into that area too because that's a I think there's a big demand for for RPGs of that nature
4246.42,4248.42, Do you play the wichor this year?
4249.62,4251.62, You should check that out wichor
4252.179999999999,4257.62, Sounds good now that it's been adequately patched. I think it's easier to recommend than it was at the beginning
4257.94,4262.0199999999995, Who makes that way back when I got stuck see the project that's that's
4263.62,4267.46," KT project there a Polish group. Oh, okay. Yeah"
4268.42,4270.42, I'm surprised being a quarter to three
4270.98,4277.78," Regular that you don't know of the wichor. No, I haven't seen that. I mean, I've seen the name. I've seen names, but I don't didn't read through it"
4278.099999999999,4282.82, So that are you playing right now besides your own stuff. Do you have time to play anything else? I
4283.299999999999,4286.82, I still play company heroes when I can I like that game a lot
4287.46,4288.98, In terms of new stuff
4288.98,4292.179999999999, We play a lot of team fortress
4292.98,4295.78, Currently more than we should say more you I should admit to and
4296.5,4300.179999999999, I've not played pegole. I know you guys are in the pegole
4300.98,4306.5," But you were to come saying you'll destroy your life and I like well, well, that guy I advertised and I think I'll get that yeah"
4306.98,4308.98," Well, I didn't say that I"
4309.0599999999995,4314.58," Maybe I did yeah, I think you did I think the words were destroy your life. Yeah, maybe are you in dead puzzle games?"
4315.299999999999,4317.78," Not really well, then no play pegole"
4318.259999999999,4322.419999999999," Me or I'm safe at least yeah, well, I my point there was that like"
4322.98,4326.5, Those games are like the kind of games that I play in between actual gaming
4326.74,4333.78, But then it turns out in my own head that's what I think I'm doing right then those are the games that I end up spending even more time on
4334.339999999999,4337.78, Because of that just one more game thing because the games are so short
4338.0199999999995,4342.099999999999, It's easy to just justify. I'll just do one more just doing more than the next and you know
4342.099999999999,4346.5," It's like three and a half hours a gun by so yeah, there's some flash games"
4346.5,4348.98, I've spent way to my challenge. I try to remember the game where
4349.46,4354.98," Tower defense I've played oh, I go ahead and try this game. I'll some six hours later. I'm still playing it"
4355.78,4361.54," Audio surface if you try that one. Yeah, I have only seen it. I've not got to play it. It's at the running at the office"
4362.66,4365.54, Good time. I think we're about to add that one to impulse
4366.1,4368.1," Oh, yeah, yeah, so"
4369.38,4372.58," Let's talk about piracy all right, are"
4374.1,4380.0199999999995," Where are you with this whole thing because we've had I mean obviously, you know, they got brought up a GDC"
4380.0199999999995,4388.1, They've been a lot of articles recently online. We've had a few people on our podcast who specifically brought that up as reasons for why they're
4388.74,4390.74, Discourged with PC gaming
4391.0599999999995,4394.58, But it seems like your take on it is a little different well
4394.9,4398.42, There's always been piracy and it's not it's getting worse
4399.0599999999995,4401.0599999999995, Because it's easier with bit torn
4401.0599999999995,4406.0199999999995, But the game industry needs to realize that it's not the only industry having to deal with this and they should look at how
4406.5,4408.5, Other markets have dealt with it like
4409.54,4414.9, Star-dark makes the desktop enhance and software like window blinds and object desktop and so on. There's always internally a
4415.3,4416.66, little bit of
4416.9,4421.38," Impatience when you see game developers come out piracy it's like well well, welcome to the party pal"
4421.38,4423.38, We've been doing with this for years and
4424.66,4429.62, Too many game developers and publishers look at a piracy every pirated copy every bit torn
4429.62,4436.34, It's copy as it lost sale and that's just not the case the question is is how do you increase your sales of your game
4437.139999999999,4441.3," As opposed to worrying so much about piracy? Well, why do you think it's not the case it does?"
4441.94,4444.82, You know that the bit torn copies equal a loss of sale
4444.98,4448.5, Well because most people who get bit torn just wouldn't have bought it anyway
4449.38,4455.62, As a practical matter you can look at the NPD figures and say well are all these games going down to toilet and sales
4455.78,4462.0199999999995, Based on similar games in the past and the answer is no they are they may have more players than they did
4462.0199999999995,4466.5, But they don't we're making less sales in general than they were in the past
4467.299999999999,4473.7, But some people are arguing that like you know the the kind of person that would know how to use bit torn
4474.34,4478.5, Would also be the kind of person who this particular or whatever
4479.22,4483.62, Hardcore PC game it is is going to appeal to in the first place so in fact
4484.179999999999,4486.66, Maybe you have lost the sale here. Well
4487.0599999999995,4490.0199999999995, It's hard to say because if someone doesn't tend to buy stuff
4490.0199999999995,4492.74, I don't tend to target them. I mean you can example
4493.38,4498.5, I am always being told we've been tearing this for years and yours at China is an emerging market for PC software
4499.0599999999995,4503.46," Well, that's great, but if I were to focus off my attention on making game for the Chinese market"
4503.86,4505.86, And it tanks because it's all pirated
4506.42,4511.54, What would do you think people is if I were to go and start complaining about that what do you think the reaction would be do you think people
4511.54,4513.54, Everyone would go feel sorry for oh
4514.34,4517.86, Poor start off there gained in selling China or would they have said well duh
4518.82,4522.98, You know they of course you're gained in selling China. It's massive piracy over there. I mean
4523.7,4525.94, There are different demographics on the PC
4527.22,4532.34, Have a higher have different piracy rates. I mean people like I have you know at the risk of of
4532.5,4538.82," Aging or setting or age up on a pedal store or sort of speak, but you and I play different types of games then"
4539.38,4543.14, Say 17 or 18 year olds do but we're also more likely to
4543.860000000001,4549.06, buyer games than a 17 or 18 year old is too right right I remember
4550.26,4551.62, I
4551.62,4553.62, Posted a blog
4553.62,4555.62, About a month or so go
4555.62,4561.06, Just about random stuff and one of the most about music that I was listening to at the time and I was
4561.38,4566.1, Have I talked about this in the podcast already just didn't get sound familiar. I'm getting a date of a feeling
4566.1,4568.1," Okay, it's just my fever"
4568.1,4570.1, This is something you haven't talked wow
4570.1,4572.1, Usually I repeat myself three or four times
4573.14,4580.1, But I was talking about new music that I that I hit new old music that I was discovering and I was discovering it through
4581.780000000001,4583.780000000001, Not just iTunes but also
4584.18,4588.740000000001, E-music.com which is a music service that offers pretty cheap downloads right and
4589.38,4595.78, I wasn't particularly pimping that slide. I was just saying here's how I'm getting my music right now these days
4596.099999999999,4601.78, And one of the private responses I got back was from some kid who was probably like a teenager who said
4602.66,4604.66, Ha ha ha old man
4605.139999999999,4607.139999999999, Hearing new music by buying it
4608.099999999999,4610.099999999999, Or something like that but the implication being
4611.219999999999,4616.26, I can't believe you're actually spending money on music right that's what he was saying to me
4617.22,4621.3, And see what happens to those people is that in other markets
4621.3,4622.26, I mean
4622.26,4624.26, Did you know that Adobe Photoshop gets pirated?
4624.26,4630.02, I mean in the game industry that must come as a shock apparently because there it Adobe's doing okay despite
4630.58,4636.34, Piracy right despite massive piracy and the reason this is because it doleby's not tart does not count
4636.34,4640.02, It's not sweating some 17 year old using Adobe Photoshop
4640.42,4644.900000000001, But in the game industry if if the if the doly ran itself like the game industry does
4645.379999999999,4651.379999999999, The people the professional graphics designers would have to have like a anal exam every time they wanted to run the photo shop
4651.7,4655.0599999999995, And oh it because they're worried about the 17 year old pirating their game
4655.0599999999995,4661.219999999999," Well, so what you say to the developers and publishers have come out you know very vocally and angrily lately saying like well"
4661.219999999999,4666.9, This is why we're not gonna make PC games anymore or this is why this is why this game is sucking
4666.9,4673.379999999999, This is why called duties and doing well because all these damn kids are pirating it right well and the answer is here
4674.34,4678.18, You have to look at how many copies of these games sold historically?
4678.18,4684.58, I mean is there all right call duty force something exerting times more on the consoles is on a PC platform
4684.58,4687.22, That's because on the console platform
4687.22,4691.7, I know it's gonna work on my console perfectly without munking around with my hardware
4691.7,4696.66," I mean these things have been talked about forever, but if I have an Xbox 360"
4696.66,4701.7, I'm getting I'm getting gonna get call doy on my Xbox 360 because that's it's definitely gonna work
4702.0199999999995,4703.7, If I get on my PC
4703.7,4707.22, It might work might not I might have problems with it who knows
4707.7,4710.58, So are you saying that that in that in that in that case?
4711.38,4714.66, You would do that every time that if there's a multi platform title
4714.66,4717.7, I would most part you're gonna default to getting the console version
4717.7,4719.139999999999," Yeah, if it's multi-platform"
4719.139999999999,4722.42, I'm generally getting the console version because like crisis for example
4722.98,4727.139999999999, I I don't crisis went to run on my machine right if I'm not on the console
4727.139999999999,4729.62, I know it's gonna run right on that even a blivion
4730.58,4736.099999999999, You know I have a blivion on the PC and on the console on the L 360 but
4736.58,4738.58, When I get it for the console
4738.74,4743.78, There's no doubt about you know and I don't want to mess with anything and that's work
4743.78,4747.38," But you know you can't say that oh well, it's because but then the publisher"
4747.38,4751.62, We try to say it's piracy that's doing that which is it's that's absurd and interface issues
4751.62,4754.099999999999, Don't come into play at all because both crisis and oblivion
4754.099999999999,4757.14, I find more enjoyable to play with a keyboard and mouse than I do with
4758.1,4765.46," Controller in hand well, and that and in those cases I didn't buy I don't play play because I have to have my mouse on a first-person shooter"
4765.46,4768.660000000001, But I came like oblivion. It's it's fine on the console
4769.22,4774.14, You know what the controller and all that so that maybe the answer for PC developers is to or
4775.14,4777.54, Publisher I mean maybe the multi platform thing is just something
4778.9800000000005,4784.5, They I don't want to say give up because probably any sales are better than no sales right right right well
4784.66,4789.86, They have to they need to look at what demographic they're trying to chart or move towards I mean
4790.82,4794.9, Look at I wrote the article now. I was talking I actually mentioned I had to cut your lawn
4794.9,4798.58, Moe your lawn the hell and she saw that but but
4799.38,4804.18, Game magazines are cover things based on what the readers want to read
4804.82,4809.62, But gained developers need to realize that the people reading the game magazines are not necessarily the game buyers
4809.7,4812.66, They're game players so a game magazine
4813.0599999999995,4819.139999999999, Should be focusing on well maybe focusing on different set of games and what people who actually buy games
4819.46,4822.5, Actually play so a gladric civilizations for example
4822.5,4827.78," Can sell 300,000 copies but you wouldn't know that you would think oh, it's not a little niche game"
4827.78,4831.0599999999995," It's like well, it's still still 300,000 copies or since is you know at"
4831.46,4834.099999999999," 200,000 copies and 45 days and"
4835.22,4842.26, You have to target who actually buys games it doesn't matter if you're as a huge player base of it if they don't buy the game
4842.74,4845.78," Right well, I mean that that's a little bit of the challenge that we're going through"
4846.42,4850.82, At the magazine as well and it's something that we're debating with this notion that
4851.78,4860.099999999999, You know who who is buying the magazine as opposed to who's reading it off the new stand or who's just never seen it
4860.42,4862.9, Now we're gonna see it because there's not that many copies out there
4863.3,4864.099999999999, You know
4864.099999999999,4869.94, The loyal subscribers are the ones who are mostly reading our magazine and if and if that's the case
4870.419999999999,4873.46, Then maybe as a magazine
4873.46,4883.46, We have to we can worry less about these quote unquote triple a games as cover material and put a game that is triple a in the mindset of
4883.86,4889.139999999999, PC gamers who are likely to read our magazine in other words since if it's all our empire
4889.46,4895.54, Might make a great magazine cover for games from windows if you think of it just in terms of the people who actually read our magazine
4895.54,4899.46, I don't know I would probably put I'd probably have word of word crafters Sims on every
4900.5,4903.86," Why are you okay? Well, there you go your my boss"
4904.339999999999,4908.099999999999," Yeah, it's the other I'm sorry. Well, I mean, you don't remember I'm the evil capitalist guy"
4908.099999999999,4912.98," Yeah, there would be a word of words. I was hoping some encouragement here Brad. Oh, no, I want you"
4913.0599999999995,4914.94, There should be Stardark stuff on every blah blah blah
4914.94,4916.94, Stardark says don't put sins of a solar impulse
4918.58,4924.66, Right because that's the easy way out right? I mean that we can look at the numbers and we can we can determine that ourselves
4924.66,4929.139999999999," Right, well, I read your Sims you had the Sims three covered it last in the current issue"
4929.14,4933.700000000001," Right. Oh, that was an awesome article. Thank you. Well, thanks you on the little I want"
4933.700000000001,4937.46, Thank you. I want to get it. Where can I get some three now? I'm ready
4938.740000000001,4940.740000000001, Ask a that's crowd humble
4941.06,4945.700000000001," Ask crowd humble. Yeah, I mean sure we get look at a new stand data and we could say okay"
4946.26,4951.5, Exactly what you said let's put waterwalk craft and and actually really it's really just one of well craft
4951.5,4957.62, I think the Sims right we could be well to walk craft monthly right and we'll well do well every single month
4957.78,4963.62, Not a question is where your bread and butter comes from is it subscribers new stand sales or advertisers and
4963.94,4968.5," You know, it's a delicate balance between the three for sure people just stop pirating"
4968.5,4972.0199999999995," I don't have a suggestion to do a lot better. Yeah, that's the big problem magazine piracy"
4972.26,4977.54," Yeah, oh you guys have the issue that I mean the your magazine covers have the"
4978.26,4982.34, They're not as attractive as they could be because you're the gains for windows things Jake
4982.34,4984.34, Any kind of you think that's not attractive
4985.14,4987.9400000000005," Oh, I think that's a logo. Well, that's not so much the logos"
4988.34,4994.26, It obscures a lot of the your creativity with it getting it selling the stronger at that retail true
4994.26,5000.18," But do have you seen the Sims three cover though because we sort of yeah, that was that got my attention did it"
5000.34,5002.34," Okay, see what work done"
5002.34,5005.38, Because we we've been playing with it if you look at that cover again
5005.38,5010.5, You'll see you know the son is setting on that screenshot and the son is bleeding all the way through the
5011.38,5012.34, Through the
5012.34,5018.34," logo right, but if you look back in some of your older issues where it's basically like a white they were very compartmentalized"
5018.34,5023.46," Yeah, the game is in a little box inside of this field a little way. That's called contractual application"
5023.86,5029.22," Yeah, I could tell my own gains from windows experiences getting the logo on our boxes, but that'd be uh"
5030.26,5031.06, Well
5031.06,5038.18," What? Please tell us that's quite an experience. I mean, it's been pretty good overall, but it's it's very it's very stringent"
5038.66,5041.22, On if you want that gains from those logo on your box
5041.780000000001,5043.780000000001," Yeah, because you know as a as a platform"
5044.18,5049.54, You know it's only the highest quality is allowed to be in games for windows as we all know
5050.66,5052.66, Being overly sarcastic so
5053.22,5060.5, So what what what kind of stringency was there for you we have to the back of the box requires a huge requirements area
5060.5,5066.18, I mean like a good third of the back of the box has to be dedicated to a very consistent format
5066.42,5069.860000000001, Which would normally have been given over to showing like screen shots or
5070.34,5075.06, Explain what the game is and then under front the gains from windows thing is pretty big on the front too
5075.54,5083.22, I don't mind that one is much but I mean at various times it's tough and then you have to get them the game months and months of advance to
5083.46,5089.780000000001, Let them approve it and all this other stuff which I mean we usually like click machine when I'll be against windows game because
5090.34,5093.22, That game won't be done until like 20 minutes before ships
5093.62,5095.9400000000005, So there won't be enough time to do that sort of thing
5097.14,5101.780000000001, I see what are they what are they checking out when they got it for that long time is it?
5101.780000000001,5105.38," Oh, what did like um you have to how the installer works"
5106.02,5110.26, My pet peeve is that I'm Windows Vista your game can only install the games explorer
5110.26,5114.66, You can't create your own icon no more desktop icons no start menu item
5115.06,5121.06, But that really bugs me because the search and windows vista does not go through games explorer
5121.700000000001,5125.780000000001, So if I just installed since the sole empire on windows vista
5126.740000000001,5131.780000000001, I have to remember I have to know it's in games explorer to find it otherwise forget it you can't find it
5132.02,5137.22, Want date aren't they just gonna assume that you would assume that right because here in vista
5137.22,5144.1, We've organized our games all under games explorer next up my except well except for Microsoft's own which don't art and games
5144.1,5145.38, Explore though
5145.38,5147.38," Yeah, so that's what that theory"
5147.62,5151.7," Yeah, that's one of the things that's kind of annoying and the game has to actually launch the program"
5151.7,5155.62, It's I mean that's the icon can only go to the program itself
5155.62,5161.3, It can't go to a launcher which I think is a big bummer because a lot of games will come into a mini launcher first
5161.3,5166.02, That lets you set your configure the video resolution and other stuff just in case
5166.5,5168.02, You know something goes wrong
5168.02,5173.86, Your you can mess with it before you get into the game where it's if you might you'll be running at some low
5173.86,5176.02, Resolution monitor you set the resolution beyond
5176.34,5181.06, What it can handle we're going to game you can't get into it again now you're going to you know text that
5181.06,5182.34, You're trying to find it
5182.34,5187.540000000001, We can't have one of those mini launchers with games for windows. Why that's a weird rule it is
5188.5,5192.34, So those are the kinds of things that are a little madening at times
5192.660000000001,5196.26, Yet they don't seem to be rules for you know mouse integration in the menus
5196.820000000001,5198.820000000001, For console port and stuff like that exactly
5199.620000000001,5201.620000000001," Yeah, this is you"
5202.18,5205.62, Because since the solar empire got the games for windows branding
5206.099999999999,5211.78, But it has its own online servers. I'm glad online did you ever even consider looking at GFW live
5212.5,5213.78, GF oh you mean
5213.78,5215.78, Now GFW live
5215.78,5217.0599999999995, I mean
5217.0599999999995,5218.26, Me my
5218.26,5224.0199999999995, My ex bucks live version for people. Oh no because we we like to get for wait we want it to be free
5224.0199999999995,5226.74, We like to give away free stuff and they tend to
5227.46,5229.46, Want to charge everything for that
5229.86,5236.02, Like if you want to put out many expansions or whatever they all they want to do they want to charge yeah
5237.06,5239.06, But another they require
5239.94,5245.54," Specifically some level of gold service every time is that how it works or yeah, I'm not sure on that"
5245.54,5247.54, I mean we didn't really pursue it that much
5247.94,5251.54, And because I mean we have our own thing we're I mean for from our perspective
5251.54,5256.02, It's almost like a competitor what we're doing right so we were either have everyone using
5256.580000000001,5260.5, Start-ox system you know you the upcoming impulse for that sort of stuff
5261.700000000001,5265.540000000001, So what would it take for a political machine 2008
5266.26,5267.780000000001, To have the
5267.780000000001,5275.46, Game Swinders logo on it like why is it is it just it's just the timing thing the timing is the biggest thing for sure on that
5277.46,5280.9800000000005, It's just it's basically overhead of having to go through the process
5281.7,5283.7, That did you feel that it was
5283.94,5288.179999999999, Ultimately worth it did it make a difference in it have it on sends yeah
5288.179999999999,5290.179999999999, I mean overall we had a very positive
5290.74,5298.9, Experience it just if you have enough lead time it's definitely worth doing because first of all you got there was that add thing that was in games for Windows magazine
5298.9,5300.9, That was very nice
5300.9,5306.0199999999995, They have to they promoted us on a lot of games for windows the program
5306.580000000001,5312.740000000001, Promoted us in a lot different areas which was really helpful and it helped that retail in some cases like with Walmart and
5313.14,5315.620000000001, In other places what in terms of what is getting in the door?
5315.780000000001,5319.700000000001, That's which getting in the door but getting them to promote it even stronger than they would have otherwise
5322.1,5328.5," So we can it can be a force for good yeah, it was is pretty good. So you brought us in impulse a couple times so"
5329.06,5331.06, Explain impulse all right well
5331.780000000001,5333.780000000001, Long time ago
5334.18,5341.06, There's start-ups started out in the late 90s make doing digital distribution on its nine game stuff a little object desktop and window blinds
5341.54,5344.9800000000005, And then when we started getting back into the games on windows
5345.3,5347.860000000001, We made this thing called total gaming dot net
5348.580000000001,5354.660000000001, And we put our game just onto that and then that was doing well enough that is some any developers came to us
5354.660000000001,5360.18, And asked us if we can we put our game on this and we let them but we didn't really care if they did or not because it was a hassle
5361.22,5366.42," But they're all separate thing well, you know, I mean we we always here's the way here's how"
5366.9800000000005,5372.900000000001, Galatically wrong I was about how digital distribution would work. I always envision that every single publisher
5373.3,5379.46, Would have their own digital distribution network so you you would have EA would have one and you be soft
5379.46,5383.9400000000005, Would have one and take two would have one and and everyone every single publisher would have one
5384.9800000000005,5390.9800000000005, So we didn't really see the reason to go and put a lot effort trying to get other people into ours because we they we figured it all get
5391.06,5396.34," Owned anyway, then one day this thing called steam comes out. Yes, and"
5397.38,5399.9800000000005," And we looked at that like us steam. They you know, that's really cool"
5399.9800000000005,5405.860000000001, We're really excited because we love we love Valve and all their games and stuff and then they're starting other people's games on there
5405.860000000001,5412.26, I know I like more I would very must be nuts because you know all don't they know that all these guys are destined to put
5412.26,5416.5, Come up with their own system. I mean no why would they put their is involved their competitor?
5416.5,5418.900000000001, Why would they put their stuff on the on a steam and
5419.54,5424.42, And then one day when we launched a sims of its solar empire users start coming to us and say
5424.98,5430.259999999999, You need to put your game on steam or I won't buy it and that freaked us out a little bit
5430.259999999999,5433.219999999999," I love freaked us out a lot so we said well, you know what we need to"
5433.7,5436.66, We're gonna have to start taking this lot more seriously. We're gonna lose control
5437.139999999999,5440.5, I don't want to it's bad enough doing with Walmart at retail
5440.5,5444.179999999999, I don't want a digital version of Walmart to to emerge on the on the games
5444.18,5449.06, I even if you know we like Valve and that so so I mean what it would meet the downside for that
5449.62,5452.34, For that is that they would get a piece of it right right
5452.34,5457.62," They I mean a 30 pretty even though they're pretty generous in their royalties, but it's still a pretty good chunk and"
5458.02,5461.46, We already we've been doing this. I mean steam was you know was
5462.42,5469.62," We were all we had been doing this for years before steam arrived and so we're like well, why would we give up all this when we already have our own system"
5470.18,5475.14, So what we've done is we've taken all of our various networks and we're combining them into a single platform
5475.46,5480.26, Which is called impulse that comes out later this month and so then we're taking our biz
5480.26,5485.14, Defteen that traditionally has been working with on our non-game stuff and we're going we're working
5485.14,5490.5, Getting all the major publishers on the games and non-games so applications utilities
5491.14,5493.14, Anti-virus you name it and
5493.62,5498.58, Letting people put their stuff right on to impulse so eventually people be able to actually submit their stuff
5499.0599999999995,5502.58, directly onto it and get their updates and and
5504.74,5507.0599999999995, Manage everything right from one program
5507.86,5512.98, You guys definitely have an advantage just in terms of that like you've said you have been around before
5513.54,5515.54, I think it's certainly been
5515.54,5519.54, No in a amongst star doc fans that you've have the subity
5520.0199999999995,5524.42," But but I wonder like you know, are you concerned at all now with impulse like"
5525.38,5529.38, Now you're like playing catch up to these guys who came along and stole the thunder
5529.62,5532.18, I mean is it gonna be hard in your eyes to compete?
5532.66,5534.18," Well, I don't think so"
5534.18,5539.06, I mean you're gonna have people are gonna go hey isn't this like steam? It'll be like every if we sort of like when people
5539.38,5542.9800000000005, Used to say our software one of our desktop enhancements was like in February
5542.9800000000005,5548.18, Even though we've been doing widgets for years before in February came out and it's like we've been doing this since 99
5548.18,5551.62," It's just we aren't as famous at it, but we figured by"
5552.34,5556.58, Our goal isn't to make steam go away our goal is to make sure that there's a viable
5557.0599999999995,5561.86, Alternative to steam so that people can you know that there's more choice out there on the market for
5562.26,5567.94, For example we're gonna build things into impulse that we think will change the way the game industry goes for example
5569.38,5571.38, We want to integrate
5572.26,5573.38, persistent
5573.38,5574.9, Worlds into
5575.14,5580.98, Impulse so that if you're a game developer and you want to have your game have a persistent monthly world where you can have a
5580.98,5582.98, subscription and you know optional subscription
5583.62,5587.54, You could do that or to support many expansion packs but anything that allows
5587.94,5591.139999999999, People who are really into their game to keep being able to get content and
5591.299999999999,5593.7, Encourages to develop or to keep making this content
5594.259999999999,5598.82, So there's a lot I think that if you if you have more than just one company doing this
5598.98,5602.259999999999," He's see a lot more innovation occur, and that's good for everyone of course"
5602.66,5604.66, So I mean obviously a challenge for us is
5604.98,5608.9, Between now and the end of the year we have to pull on all the the content right?
5608.9,5611.46, It doesn't we can have all kinds of cool tech but if you can't get
5611.94,5615.379999999999, You know spring commander or whatever on on impulse then
5615.86,5622.099999999999, That's not gonna do you any good so is there is there any reason you wouldn't see a game on both steam and
5622.66,5628.74, Impulse like Supreme Commander or is there some sort of exclusivity but only if the only if a particular deal has
5629.62,5632.82, Is exclusive I mean there's some things that are exclusive on to steam
5632.9,5635.299999999999, I mean I don't think you're gonna see half life on impulse
5635.94,5638.82, Real real soon. I'm just I'm but because I'm gonna go out
5638.9,5643.86," I'm gonna go on a limb and make that prediction. Okay, all right. I'm I'm a really crazy guy"
5644.58,5650.339999999999, And similarly you probably won't see since of a solar empire on steam anytime soon or any and I mean one
5650.58,5654.42, Advantage to start like does has is have is that we are also a retail publisher
5654.42,5661.78, So as we get a lot of growing number of pretty major developers coming to us wanting us to publish their games not just digitally
5661.78,5668.42," But at retail just doesn't step you know, instead of going to EA or two k games are coming to us now as well"
5669.139999999999,5675.139999999999, That we can you know that gives us an instant level of content that's advantage so you're gonna have could I remember when I bought
5675.54,5678.259999999999, Galsive two I bought I downloaded
5679.46,5684.339999999999, Digitially and then also had the option to have a retail copy ship to me and I did that
5684.5,5689.86," Yeah, and I'm glad I did that because I like having a retail capary you're gonna be doing something like that with all the games on impulse right now"
5690.179999999999,5695.62, It depends on the on the game. I'd like to see where you can literally do a checkbox and you can download the game
5695.62,5704.82, It just have ship to almost like well like Amazon should be doing with a Kindle thing where you can you know buy the Kindle version and get the book ship to
5705.86,5707.38," Oh, is that other doing it now?"
5707.38,5711.78," They're not doing yet. That's how it should be doing. Oh, I see. I mean now that would make it a lot more appealing"
5711.94,5713.14, Exactly
5713.14,5717.0599999999995, So we're just gonna do that. We're gonna do what we wish Amazon that kind would do with the Kindle
5717.46,5722.74," With games, but it's not and it's not just games. It's is your utilities and everything else and"
5723.0599999999995,5731.0599999999995, We have we have a lot of relationships with the OEMs and that that we're trying to build upon because I so we're putting together a affiliate programs to make it easier for people to sell
5731.62,5733.62, Games using impulse as their service
5734.82,5738.74," And you have like asked because the valve of an out steam or tracing label, you know"
5739.219999999999,5744.98," Yeah, the way for the developers to directly track everything themselves. You have something like that and works here. Yeah, we do"
5745.62,5751.219999999999, We have a I mean for example the I mean that's a that is a good start having it where you can people can track
5751.3,5756.66, Who's playing their game and how many users but having services like matchmaking
5758.26,5763.22, You know everyone else how fun matchmaking services tend to be in these games. They're almost never work
5763.9400000000005,5769.860000000001, Right it seems like but we can build a matchmaking service that's basically bulletproof works amongst a couple different games
5770.1,5774.58, Here's something that third parties can make you so because like you guys have said in the past I mean like
5774.82,5779.22, That was pretty much owns at first person shooter experience. I mean half life and
5780.26,5785.7, And team fortress. I think Stardock is emerging is one certainly one leading strategy game
5786.66,5791.14, Publishers and developers so what are the kinds of things that strategy gamers want to their games
5791.14,5794.66, They want good matchmaking for setting up a game. They want
5796.58,5802.82, Potentially a persistent server where their characters and their stats are kept on for whatever empires are building and
5802.9,5807.94, Those are the kinds of things we can build into impulse that developers will be at a leverage over time
5808.0199999999995,5815.94, So how big a deal is the social connection stuff to you because the appeal of something like steam or even GFW live if it had caught on was you know
5816.58,5822.58, What especially when steam announced the community features was okay finally there's gonna be this one unified place this one
5823.46,5829.0599999999995, Friends list right that I'll only need one I can get rid of all these other things that I've been using you know
5829.06,5836.18, I don't know the disparate you know chat servers and X-Flyer and all the best stuff so I don't think people were gonna be getting rid of I mean
5836.18,5842.18," You know I'm I have I used the community features on steam too, but I'm not about to get rid of X-Fyre or"
5843.22,5848.26," Or in some messenger or anything like that anyway, I mean, yeah, that's what they invented trillion four and and"
5849.9400000000005,5854.580000000001, So you don't think there's this unified awesome future. I don't think gamers want a unified I mean what
5855.54,5860.26, No matter how much we like valve or how much people like start up I don't think anyone out there wants them to be the
5860.82,5869.18, Only ones to do that sort of thing. I mean besides it creates an opening for third party to create stuff that talks between it to I mean that's what typically happens
5870.38,5871.98, You're at the trustbuster
5871.98,5873.18," Well, right well, I"
5873.18,5879.66, I'm just paranoid. I like there to be I like to have options on I don't know how much I like it's for like Google right
5879.66,5884.3," I like Google as a search engine boy, I buy glad there's still Yahoo and other people out there to keep modest"
5885.5,5889.46," Well, it probably in a nutshell. That's a huge part of the the"
5889.7,5891.62, Windows live thing yeah
5891.62,5895.5," It's a problem right there. Yeah, you're doing. I think you're getting the nail on the head there right"
5895.66,5898.94," Yeah, because you don't want pretty soon if you only have one vendor pretty soon"
5898.94,5904.139999999999, They can start charging you for all kinds of stuff and it's a they can say would it will be like on South Park that one episode
5904.139999999999,5906.62, So what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?
5906.62,5912.26," Yep, I mean, yeah, you can see that with Xbox live and even like a their little indie developer"
5912.26,5918.099999999999," Didn't it what didn't the um Microsoft just changed a royalty rate dramatically to yeah, they drop it especially for the"
5918.62,5924.66," XNA games. I think they dropped it way lower. Yeah, it's been a big source of attention like some people are just saying I was gonna"
5925.58,5932.26," Developing for Xbox live. No, I'm not right period. I'm not going to so that's the danger there exactly"
5932.62,5938.860000000001, So I mean the game the PC game industry if it wants to keep generating revenue and it'll be more healthy
5938.860000000001,5945.860000000001, It's gonna have to evolve and I think one of the ways to evolve is to it isn't either just become a subscription network like
5945.860000000001,5947.54, MMM or
5947.54,5954.22, Who cross platform reconcils but there are other ways allow people a lot people who really like your game to keep being out of player game
5954.22,5959.74, And be able to generate revenue from that in a way that benefits to player and I think that these platforms
5959.74,5967.2, Whether it be impulse or steam or what have you are gonna have to keep adding these kinds of features to a lot of developers to do this sort of thing
5967.58,5970.219999999999, without bringing on the associate costs

6224.16,6227.04, So you go to the front and you can't hit him
6227.12,6233.24," Yeah, I'm trying to get excited about battle star, but that's season three"
6233.24,6236.96, I don't know. Oh you guys aren't caught up like I said

6243.28,6245.28, Dude I
6245.28,6250.4, That's a huge hole in your geek cred. You've got to get kind of confused because I know certain
6250.64,6255.88, Things happened in the plot that I didn't want to know happen involving one particular character if we went on by on a woman
6256.2,6260.28, But then yeah now I see ads and she's like she's in it again
6260.56,6264.78," Well, I guess safe to hide it. I guess safe decided that that's not a spoiler anymore"

6287.959999999999,6291.32, She's right a silent well right everyone's a silent or she's a god
6291.32,6293.0, See what this show she could be anything
6293.4,6294.959999999999, That's the way well whatever
