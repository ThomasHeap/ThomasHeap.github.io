0.0,9.6," Hello and welcome to GFW radio. It is August 14th, 2007. I am Jeff Green, the energy"
9.6,14.24, of Game Swordsmith magazine. It got to feel like it's been a long time since we've done this.
14.24,19.04," Because it has been a long time. Oh yeah, that's what I feel is that way. I'm here with"
19.04,24.64," where minus a Sean Elliott today, but we have three other editors and they are."
24.72,30.0, Ryan Scott. Daring Ledstone and Sean the Maloy. So what are we going to do with that? Sean?
30.0,34.16, Somebody else has to tug griefing stories today. We're griefing or Dick and Farjogs. There's some
34.16,39.28," random scatter reference. Here's the web. Rob. Rob. We're actually going to talk about PC games today,"
39.28,46.64, I guess we'll have to. I had one griefing low griefing story in my head because it happened to
46.64,50.8, about an hour ago before we came under two hours. So I wanted to share this with you and do tell
50.8,55.519999999999996, that you guys know if it ever happened to you in a while or any other game. So I was fishing.
56.72,60.72, Because fishing is something you can do when you're actually trying to do something else like a
60.72,64.8, work or talking to the phone. Like it's said there doesn't hit click the fishing thing.
65.84,73.75999999999999, And so it cast the line in the in the water. And then some doofus brick and torrent ass monkey
74.32,80.32, gets in the water where I'm fishing and like sticks his body like right where the fishing water is.
80.32,86.8, So then you know what that does is it you know negates my ability to be able to click on the
86.8,91.91999999999999, the bobber to get the fish. And then I would like I thought I thought it was a coincidence like
91.91999999999999,96.08, this dude's a swim the water. So I moved the fishing line and then he swims over and moves so he's
96.08,102.32," under the line again. So I can't fish. Like fishing. What the fuck? Okay, I can't even fish with that"
102.32,105.91999999999999, ping-gree. What is that? It's called a guy out. Who is it? I don't know if it's worse that you were
106.0,110.0, actually fishing or worse that he was briefing your fishing. That's sad.
110.0,113.76, Briefing fishing. Yeah. He has nothing better to do. Exactly.
113.76,117.68, Like you really not have anything better to do with your time in the middle of the day on a
117.68,121.92, unda really. Me as it would seem to be said for you as you sit in their fishing player.
121.92,125.52000000000001, Well I guess that's why he was graphing. He was like so. Well that's it. That actually is my
125.52000000000001,128.8, problem with world of work out fishing in general. The fact you have to click on it.
128.8,132.16, Because if you do want it's like it should be something where you can just like watch TV and
132.16,135.92, I'd only do that. Yeah. But you can't because you have to watch your screen precisely for the
135.92,140.8, moment that bobber hits. It really is the worst thing in a while ever. I think.
140.8,144.8, All right. It's hard. We're doing my mechanic. Is there anything that can automate it?
144.8,149.44, Well yeah they need a fish bot. That's the thing. All you're doing is watching. You click on
149.44,154.16, the you throw your line in the water and then you get the progress bar you know going in reverse
154.16,159.12, from right to left and sometimes during the course of that progress bar you'll see a little
159.12,163.84, you may or may not see a little splash in the water and at that precise moment you have to
163.84,167.76, click it and maybe you'll get a fish or not. That was their solution to fish bots.
168.96,174.72, Right. But you have to click on the thing. Right. If you even turn away from a second you might miss
174.72,179.76, the splash and then you have to start over again. So you actually have to watch the fucking progress
179.76,186.96, bar. Why are you saying? Well that's another exact fishing. Well it's helpful for
187.84,191.6, yeah you're selling yourself. I mean it's helpful for like making food for like raids and stuff.
191.6,198.32, That's what I use it for. It's a stupid reason. Okay for what for one I was trying to do like you
198.32,203.44, know low rent work at my desk. So I couldn't really play. Couldn't like you know play a
203.44,208.8, gap. Do a question or whatever. Nor could you do your work up. I couldn't do my work either
208.8,216.4, because I had to watch the progress bar. I'm out as well just been in the raid. But but also there's
216.56,222.64000000000001, a quest in a terracar forest that requires fishing. I have to get all these fish. I have a feeling
222.64000000000001,226.96, you could probably kill the mobs around there and get the fish too. But I wanted to get them out of the lake
228.08,233.52, because I'm stupid that way. So anyway the moral of the story there is no moral. I got grief
233.52,238.8, quite selfish. I thought you were going to talk about griefing during lunch. Oh that person.
239.44,244.56, Oh big grief. I thought he was a lot real life lady. He was a life grief. Yeah she was awesome.
244.88,251.84, Yeah we got those listening should now if we sand all traumatized today. The fire was here left a
251.84,258.56, burrito place in San Francisco and we're mowed down. Some agro out of that 50 year old woman.
259.44,265.28, I don't know what her deal was. She blew past us. She put elbowed Jeff out of the way and like she's
265.28,269.36, staggered she's like a linebacker. I don't know what you like push me out of the way. I just
269.36,273.52000000000004, just love to respond after Jeff says excuse me and she goes yeah excuse you.
275.2,282.0, Look I'm walking here. Yeah that was a weird moment. How dare you get her way? Yeah that was odd.
282.0,286.96000000000004, Do we have that little authority? We're getting pushed around by 50 year old women. This is probably
286.96000000000004,295.12, a listener. Yeah hey well fuck you if you're a listener. It's a right lady. You think you're
295.12,299.68, tough on the street but you're in the podcast when you're way down the street from me.
299.68,309.12, I'll kick your ass. Before we came on we were all talking about what we were excited for
309.12,312.48, which is what everybody's excited for. So we can't really talk about it because we're
312.48,319.28000000000003, in a play to yet. But by our shock. Yeah we plan it tonight. I'll be doing it on demo.
319.28000000000003,324.88, That was one slow download. Yeah well they sprung it on everyone last night and I think
325.12,329.6, it was a big surprise to everyone just run out. Oh my god. Right but you would think Sunday in the
329.6,334.24, middle of the night you'd be clear I guess I guess not. Yeah what's a good sign for that game?
334.24,340.24, I think initially like what nine years ago now when Baruch Aquastil was first in Fancy.
340.24,343.92, Yeah and it was like oh about that game gets like critically praised but no one buys it.
343.92,351.12, There is a story up on Kataku today about how that's an interview with Ken LeBee and actually I think
351.2,355.84000000000003, it was linked from Kataku. So sorry if I'm not getting to credit there right but
356.64,361.28000000000003, about how Ken LeBee had to shop this thing around for forever to get a publisher.
361.28000000000003,365.44, Well I remember what happened back in the day was they actually fished at the initial story
365.44,369.84000000000003, that went up on I think was game spot. It was basically a last effort to try to get someone
369.84000000000003,373.28000000000003, like interested in getting this game. So when they ran that preview and they saw so many
373.28000000000003,377.12, hits were up people like we're just all over the net get crazy about it. Uh huh.
377.2,381.28000000000003, Published has started stepping up all the sudden. What actually happened here that made it get so
381.28000000000003,386.72, like become the it game? Has really it wasn't even that long ago a year when there were still
386.72,392.8, previous going on it wasn't quite all that yet in gamers minds. Um I think as people saw more and
392.8,396.56, more of the game and because they held back so much for so long you never really got a good vibe
396.56,400.8, for what the game was about. Yeah well now that's not the case for sure. Well I actually know
400.8,406.32, it's everywhere. Over exposure. Oh I've actually I mean the biggest stop reading. Yeah seriously
406.4,410.48, the biggest the biggest compliment I could pay to any game is that I don't read the previews anymore
410.48,413.52, and they're like Sean I'm sorry you're just I know your story was awesome but there are so many
413.52,420.71999999999997, spoilers. It really was awesome. I just like like your big frag knowledge back. But I so did not
420.71999999999997,424.88, want to read it because I didn't want to spoil the experience. Yeah and it's gotten the point I
424.88,428.71999999999997, warned Amy that I'm going to be emotionally unavailable when this game comes out next week. Yeah we
428.71999999999997,433.36, got a letter saying someone complaining about that preview because it's too spoilery and it was like
433.44,437.68, first hour of the game. Right I spoiled the first second and he was like oh you should have
437.68,443.6, made a spoiler warning. Okay yeah I think the demo if you if you haven't played it and you have
443.6,448.40000000000003, X box live is the first hour too so you may want to watch it if you don't want the spoiler there.
448.40000000000003,454.40000000000003, Tom Czech was up on on his website quarter to three and he was saying do not play the demo. Don't
454.40000000000003,458.40000000000003, play it by the game. Yeah I think if you I think if you know you're getting a tongue and cheek
458.47999999999996,464.0, but he else he said he sort of meant it. Yeah well actually I guess if you play the first hour
464.0,467.59999999999997, and you see things you do you want to do differently when the final game comes out that's probably a good
467.59999999999997,473.2, start a good thing. Well let me ask you guys a question and answer honestly because we all have
474.32,480.08, PCs and Xboxes you have been not done you right. Yeah. Are you guys going to play on the PC or the
480.08,485.91999999999996, Xbox? Neither. Well I'm not going to play it. It's a first version shooter. Oh get over it man.
485.92,490.96000000000004, You're like triple fired. Wow. It's like we're going to fire you. We're going to fire you.
490.96000000000004,495.36, You hire you and then refire you just to make sure you get the message. Holy cow do you.
496.56,504.16, I don't know say to you. Oh Ryan. I have a hard time with first person games.
504.16,508.32, Is being playing them or the motion thing? Do you know what I should say?
508.32,513.9200000000001, It's like I that'd be fair. I can't deal with like the camera. I can't.
514.0,517.12, Third person can you deal with? You could deal with. I mean I can go. I can't deal with
517.12,520.24, around me with third person. Do you have trouble walking? Yeah.
522.24,528.0799999999999, Real life. Real life. Like you have a third person camera for real life. Here I am walking down the
528.0799999999999,532.8, street. We get that. I'm walking for real and I'm walking in the game. No chewing gum.
534.0799999999999,540.0, You know I mean like whenever I whenever I would try to play a game and death and
540.0,543.92, act or something and somebody you know you have people like Sean Elliott who are jumping all over
543.92,550.32, the place like maniac. You know like who that's what the console is for. I'm like trying to turn around
550.32,553.76, and by the time I can turn around to see like what's seen you from behind I'm already dead.
553.76,558.48, I get it. You know I have to see get that with console shooters. In console shooters I feel like
558.48,564.64, you do. When I'm playing halo or whatever I don't have that mastered at all. Like the strafing.
564.64,569.92, I can't stand a lack of circle straf. Can I can we ask this in public?
570.08,575.44, Can you circle straf? It's very for a question. You don't need to know that.
575.44,579.28, That probably means now. Wow. We need an aptitude test. Is it a test?
579.28,583.84, Is it a test? Is it a test? Is it a test? Have you tried playing console first person shooters?
583.84,587.6, Since you've like decided you can't play PC first. Is it a matter of the speed?
587.6,591.2, Because I know like your console console ones are harder for me. Yeah.
591.2,596.32, I tried like halo and hammering. It still speed like drummer for you. Now one of these two guys said
597.2800000000001,602.4000000000001, a minute ago. So that's what the 360 version is for. You said that.
602.4000000000001,608.96," Because in Boschak on the 360 you play it behind over the shoulder? No, no, just you know it's"
608.96,613.84, got. There's no one playing inside you for one thing. Oh you just meant like it.
613.84,619.0400000000001, I came assist in all of them. Never mind. Right. It's made a bit easier. So like the precision
619.0400000000001,622.4000000000001, isn't that good. I mean you don't not necessarily in Boschak's case for it's like
623.36,629.04, for you but it does for you a bit. Well I guess you know we don't have to shame you in the play.
629.76,635.92, I mean you. I'm like a diehard Metroid fan. I couldn't even get you Metroid Prime all the way.
635.92,639.04, Right. You must have been tortured. So you must have been tortured.
639.04,643.36, Okay. Well that's that's kind of fair. I guess interesting. Yeah.
644.8,651.1999999999999, I'm going to play the PC one. I'm going to do the PC one for sure. Only mainly because of the hotkey.
651.2800000000001,656.72, Because when I was playing it just there's so much switching between
656.72,661.2800000000001, plasmids and stuff that just the podcast you can just do it much faster. At least I presume I can.
661.84,666.8000000000001, I'm a little concerned about my machine. I think as long as my machine is good enough I will play it on the
666.8000000000001,670.96, PC. And that's that's the trick right now with a lot of games too. Yeah. We're kind of in that
670.96,676.32, in between the phase where people are like waiting to buy that new PC. That's me too.
676.32,680.72, Yeah. Next time having major tech problems with the existing PC at home so that might be
680.88,684.08," time real soon here. Well, good luck playing Stranglehold while we're at it."
684.96,688.24, Really? Oh yeah. That's right. That has that super higher requirement because of all that
688.24,694.64, reckon particle shit. Is that right? It's true. But it requires a dual core. It requires dual core.
694.64,697.84, That's so that you can watch like fruit being blown up in a million. It's the dollars.
697.84,701.28," So you see, they should get it on the dove card. Yeah. You have one. Yeah. You don't want graphics card. Just"
701.28,707.44, to have all the dollars. One processor. Just for dove. I can't take it. So with that game. Is that going to be
707.44,711.12," good or not? Well, the guys in the console side have been really digging it. I haven't seen it."
711.12,716.0, I believe. But what if they know what's basically max. It's max pain. Right. I mean. That's what
716.0,722.5600000000001, yeah. I was on. I was a guest on one of them other podcasts that we have here. And that's what
722.5600000000001,726.32, they were. That's what they were all saying. The way they were describing the game play. I was
726.32,731.44," like, isn't this max pain? Yeah. I mean, that's what they're like in the game. It's a lot of"
732.1600000000001,736.72," card bowls in the first place. Well, yes. Yeah. So it's a comfortable circle. So maybe we need to"
736.72,740.32," have someone come down from that. From that show, have our BR fifth chair. We can have a competition"
740.32,744.8000000000001," that. And we could argue about. I mean, I didn't get that in the max pain either. So it's not my"
744.8000000000001,750.5600000000001," kind of name. Yeah. But it looks cool for that kind of game. Yeah. I mean, it looks kind of interesting."
750.5600000000001,754.32," I'm put. I'm going to definitely check it out for sure. I think the, I was just thinking about"
754.32,758.5600000000001," it last week when the news came out about the specs. I was a little, remember we were talking"
758.56,763.1999999999999," about it for you. I was a little like, I wouldn't say like dismissive about the specs."
763.1999999999999,770.2399999999999," Because I might, like, yeah, you kind of were. Yeah, I was. I was a total last. No, I"
770.2399999999999,774.4799999999999," might, yeah, my initial argument was, yeah, every one of the past years got a computer that"
774.4799999999999,777.8399999999999," could play this game, which you still think is kind of true. But the sad part is, well, yeah,"
777.8399999999999,781.52, but that's the past year. Exactly. Right. So I don't have you bought it. I think you're in the
781.52,786.16," past exactly. Well, the fifth thing is there's always these like these, these lynch pin moments"
786.16,790.88," in time when you buy the right computer. Right. And when you don't, and I just, like, my argument"
790.88,794.7199999999999," back, like, last week when I was thinking about it was, you know, when a wing commander first came"
794.7199999999999,798.9599999999999," out, that was an upgrading game. I mean, people would actually buy sound cards and more ram. Right."
798.9599999999999,803.6," Right. We're clearly at that moment. Exactly. With every new game, it's sort of like, okay,"
803.6,808.88, is now the time when I do it. We're on this travel time. We're on that threshold of a new age.
810.88,813.76," I'm going to say, Katherine Hepburns. Drangle, sorry. Stringle,"
814.72,819.28," Stringle Hold is not the game that will make me up exactly. No, I mean, it'll be a buy product game."
819.28,823.68," And maybe some people want to check it out afterwards. But I will say buy a buy a shot. I mean,"
823.68,828.24," if I can't play it right away, I will just play the 360 version again. I can't not play this immediately."
828.24,833.28," However, if it turns out I can't play it on the PC, that's very likely going to be the"
833.28,837.2," straw that breaks a camel's back for me. No, I'm going to just have to upgrade. And you guys heard"
837.2,840.56," about anything. It is buy a shot going to be like, you know, mod a bowl in any way, shape. I can,"
840.56,844.8, I can imagine it will be considering a rationality. I can't get that stuff. I don't know.
844.8,848.0799999999999," Well, I just think about it this way. Like, you know, hopefully, like when I believe what a"
848.0799999999999,852.64," believe it came out, I was like, okay, which version of my game? And I played the console version,"
852.64,858.0, because I wanted to see it on the big screen and like that whole majestic view. But then a couple
858.0,862.0," months later, like when I finished the game and all that stuff, and like you see all these mods that"
862.0,866.8, came out from the end users on the PC version. Yeah. And I was always toy left out my call.
867.68,872.0799999999999," I do not know. I never did anything with the oblivion mod. Oh, you know, I was there. There's some"
872.0799999999999,876.16," great stuff out there. Yeah, I played it on the side of that reason. And then I didn't, yeah, I"
876.16,881.1999999999999," didn't have a lot. I'm like, I'll be able to like play this game for 900 years. I'll be able to"
881.1999999999999,886.7199999999999," create my own maps. Oh, wait, I don't give a shit about that. I forgot, but I could if I wanted to."
888.0799999999999,895.8399999999999," I mean, most of the time, I don't even finished the game. I'm the best. So I'm, I'm about you guys, but I'm"
895.84,900.8000000000001," pretty happy for a rational. I'm very happy for a rational. Well, I'm only a sad about. Yeah,"
900.8000000000001,907.9200000000001," two K Boston. Two K Boston. Well, that's suck in timing. It's still them, though. Yeah,"
907.9200000000001,913.76," the end of the day. We can't complain about name changes. If anybody can't, it's games for"
913.76,918.88," window. See, official magazine. Yeah. Glasshouse. It's a name. It's them. Right. It's still that."
918.88,922.5600000000001, And it sounds like you can believe in this to be believed. And why not? Because he's a stand-up guy
923.1199999999999,927.1999999999999," that they're totally good at. Like, hey, two K, you made this possible. So,"
927.1999999999999,932.64," right. Very true. Good for it. Right. But you know, I'm not sure if one and two neither of those."
932.64,937.76," I mean, they were critical favorites. I don't know who bought them at all. Did they sell 10 copies?"
937.76,942.7199999999999," But those were those were awesome games. And so yeah, it's it's so great to see them actually"
943.4399999999999,948.2399999999999," have, well, you know, we know it's great yet. But what looks like it's going to be a great game."
948.24,953.44," That is also going to be popular. You know, that's like it's like a good guy's winning sort of story."
953.44,958.88," I haven't been this excited for a game in a very long time. And actually, honestly, like years."
959.44,964.16," And this is a holiday season full of games like that where I'm just like, there's a lot of stuff"
964.16,968.4," to look forward to this on it. In terms of shooters for me, I don't know. This goes back to like"
968.96,974.96, Half-Life 2 maybe. I can't even think of another one that seemed like that was so big in my mind.
975.6,982.88," And I garnered on one of the artists was saying, uh, best shooter he's ever played period period."
983.84,988.24, And we called him on it quite a few times. And he kept backing up. I don't know what that says.
988.24,994.4000000000001," Well, let's say it says something about him. Will no soon enough. I always say hyperbole, but this could be one of"
994.4000000000001,999.44, those games been getting good reviews so far. We all we can't wait. And hopefully next week.
1000.0,1002.48," Wait, it comes out what day? 21st Tuesday. Right."
1003.44,1007.44," Yeah, damn it. So that's after the next week's podcast. Yeah. So come to the 22nd."
1007.44,1013.28," To the 21st. I'll be sick on the 22nd. Yeah, just dicting that. Maybe we'll just call it sick day here work."
1013.6800000000001,1018.16," If I'm a lie, I think you're going to get to play it this week. Aren't you? That seems to be the plan."
1018.16,1023.04," So when you're if you're going to be able to talk about it on yield podcast, I actually, he must be able to"
1023.04,1028.96, Because it comes out. Because we're going to end then our podcast. We just want spoilers. That's all.
1029.52,1034.96," We'll talk in vagaries. Yeah. Meanwhile, somebody asked on the message board at one"
1034.96,1041.68," up asked me if I thought it was worth playing the system shock games. And I said, an abashedly."
1041.68,1046.64," Yes. Who? Yes. Wait them. And they're probably cheap now. If they're still a bit,"
1046.64,1051.28," yeah, actually, they should be still around. Like, if you do find system shock to somewhere,"
1051.28,1056.64," there's also a texture upgrade patch. Oh, that's right. That some that some modders created"
1056.72,1060.5600000000002," years after the fact. Oh, I forgot about that. Yeah. So I forget the name of it right now. But"
1060.5600000000002,1066.0," you know, if you do find system shock to you, you should definitely check that out. I bet that game"
1066.0,1071.3600000000001, still totally holds up even with somewhat outdated graphics. Sure. You should go back and play it.
1071.3600000000001,1077.5200000000002," Find out. Well, maybe I will. All right. Maybe you will. I say, yeah, I want to make it do a"
1077.5200000000002,1082.3200000000002, return. That's on. Yeah. I just finished the fear single player campaign again last night.
1082.3999999999999,1088.8799999999999, Okey. And any better. I like that a lot. I like that game the first time. It did. There were some
1090.32,1095.04, were a lot of hallways. Yeah. But to say that was what all the corporate building there. A lot
1095.04,1102.1599999999999, of hallways and staircases. It's still the AI is great. The the atmosphere is great. Playing that game with
1102.1599999999999,1110.8799999999999," headphones. A lot of fun. Good story, too. Did you find yourself jumping back a lot like the second time"
1111.2,1116.72," through? You mean at a fright or just kind of like, you know, a couple moments. I definitely did."
1117.1200000000001,1120.4," I always wonder that especially with like, you know, a game you played before and you kind of know,"
1120.4,1128.0," okay, this is the part where all what comes out of, you know, the side. If you'll get it again. Exactly."
1128.0,1132.72," Oh, sometimes in some cases that makes it even better. Because like, you're like, oh, this is that"
1132.72,1137.6000000000001," part that I don't know. I freaked me out last time. I really did like when. I mean, the only terms. I"
1137.6,1144.32," think I really jumped is when I thought I was outfilling the AI and got like snuck up on,"
1144.32,1148.1599999999999," which was really cool. You know, there were a couple times when they just like got me and I was like,"
1148.1599999999999,1159.76," you know, just like that. Good game. So yeah, I don't know. We'll have to see what they come up with next."
1160.3999999999999,1164.24, What will they do next? Those wacky kids in monolids.
1164.32,1165.6, Do do do do do.
1165.6,1170.88, And the funny thing about it. So we hit more watch a plan. Since we're sort of talking about what we
1170.88,1173.68, what we want to play. Why the fuck not? Okay.
1174.56,1180.56, Thank you. Fuck yeah. That's a lot of the f-lums in the weeks podcast. All right. If to make up for
1180.56,1191.28," less. Well, we didn't podcast. Yeah. Okay. Ryan. Well, since our last podcast, I have replayed a lot of the"
1191.36,1198.0, old Lucas art. Really. Except loom. What? I did not play loom. What led you down that path?
1199.36,1207.36," Um, I just wanted to play them to see if they held up over time. And did they? A lot of them do."
1207.36,1213.6, I play. I played through Dave the technical. I play through. All three paths of Indiana Jones and the
1213.6,1219.44," fate of Atlantis, which I think is one of the best. Yeah. That is good. It does to be my favorite."
1219.52,1224.0800000000002, I'm doing salmon next hit the road right now. Mm-hmm. And then I'm going to do the monkey island.
1224.0800000000002,1231.3600000000001," Oh, is that with cracking on your list? Is that a McCrak? It's a game I tried to play. That's a game I've"
1231.3600000000001,1239.6000000000001, never quite. That's really an I loved it. That game like it doesn't give you enough.
1241.6000000000001,1246.72," Oh, I don't have that differ from the others. The other is. I think the problem is that each"
1246.8,1251.28," game has their own kind of unique game logic. Yeah. And if you don't get the logic of the game,"
1251.28,1257.28," I'm a cracking as Vandy's range from start. Yep. You know, I mean, it's,"
1257.28,1263.2, did you guys play these games? Did you play any of them without hints or walkthroughs?
1263.2,1267.2," I could play it all without hints. At all, you never needed a hint for any of the puzzles."
1268.0,1273.52," Maybe the latter day one, I had it like internet access, but like with Indiana Jones and I guess"
1273.52,1277.68," he had back in the day that was a maniac mansion and stuff. Like, it was all me. Yeah, when I was"
1277.68,1281.84," I was obsessive. I played a lot of those. When I was a kid, there was one game that I think was"
1281.84,1284.48, I figured whether there was the original space cluster one of the second ones because I wasn't used
1284.48,1289.84," to the logic yet. So I was one of those games that I really had to like consult the cheatbook for,"
1289.84,1294.6399999999999," you know, the ones that I actually have with highlighters. Yeah. So you'd like by the by the end, I was like,"
1295.2,1298.6399999999999," I don't want to confess that I need to help on this one. So I was like, I think the"
1298.64,1303.76," tonic was one. I loved that game so much because it was so funny. But I think I had to keep,"
1303.76,1309.6000000000001," it was like, Compy server or something I kept going there. One of those old online BBSs to get answers."
1309.6000000000001,1313.92," And I would read the answer and go, there's just no, my brain would never have done that in the"
1313.92,1317.1200000000001," million years. Does it have a couple of other things? Yeah, I mean, weren't there any that we're like,"
1317.1200000000001,1320.24," oh, I should have thought of it? I think, oh, totally. Yeah, of course. Day of the"
1320.24,1325.2," tenicles, you know, back when I was 13 or whatever, that was a game that I recall having a very hard time with"
1325.28,1330.96," a lot of puzzles. And going back to it, it's like a lot of the clues for a lot of the puzzles"
1330.96,1334.96," are very obvious. And part of that's probably because, you know, I'm like kind of vaguely remembering,"
1334.96,1339.76," like, oh, yeah, this is what I had to do there. Right. But I think Darren's right. It's like,"
1339.76,1344.96," your brain kind of gets trained to think that in that, yeah, cartoon logic or whatever,"
1344.96,1349.68," which is why I thought the new seven max game was so good is because they're totally, like,"
1349.68,1353.8400000000001," just latch back onto that. Yeah, they all, you have been trained to do this. Yeah,"
1353.9199999999998,1358.3999999999999, these make sense in their own crazy way. But I only like maybe one puzzle in the whole series
1358.3999999999999,1363.4399999999998," that made me go, there are a couple times when I cheated out of laziness just because I wanted to get,"
1363.4399999999998,1368.8799999999999," I just wanted to get to the next step. I was like, okay, I, there's gotta be, I'm not on this."
1368.8799999999999,1373.84," And then when I would read it, I would go, oh shit, duh, right. That always stuff like that."
1373.84,1378.48," And just because of the nature of those, like, something you think should work, like, because you're"
1378.48,1382.32, not hovering over the right place at the right time without working and then you don't realize
1382.48,1386.56," the great thing those games do is when you go to do the obvious thing, that of course it was never"
1386.56,1390.48," going to be the answer ever. And they always like call you on it, you know."
1391.6799999999998,1395.9199999999998," It's like there's a lever to pull, you know, when you pull it, then the character who's standing there"
1395.9199999999998,1401.52," is always like insult you, you know. Like, yeah, yeah, I thought of that nice try."
1402.8,1406.72," All right, what do you think was the, okay, now I think I know what everyone's going to answer on this."
1406.72,1409.76," What do you think is the stupidest puzzle Lucas Sierra, whatever?"
1409.84,1412.24, You're all going to say that we are going to say the same thing.
1412.24,1416.72," You're going to say, which one? Because I gave you a night three puzzle with the cat hair mustache."
1416.72,1421.76," Like, yeah, well, I didn't play that. Oh, okay. Well, you've missed a really bad puzzle."
1421.76,1426.64," That there's one in fate of Atlantis. Think, maybe you just played this. So you probably remember,"
1426.64,1431.84," we're in a there's like a comb, you have to make like some sort of compass out of a comb and a needle"
1431.84,1436.48," and honey with something ridiculous. You have to, what you have to, Mr. Wizard project, you know,"
1436.56,1442.48," you have to tie, there's like a string or something and you tie it to this comb and you rub the comb with a scarf,"
1442.48,1447.68, the chart of the static electricity. The clues are in the game to tell you that these things that you're
1447.68,1452.4," looking for respond to static electricity. So it's not, okay, it's set up. It's set up, I mean,"
1452.4,1458.56," you wasn't when I played. But the thing is that that item, if you, if you play on either of the other paths,"
1459.1200000000001,1464.96," there's a different item that that accomplishes the same thing and you're told in specific terms,"
1464.96,1469.68," that's what it's for. So if you've played the other paths, I think you'll have a better idea that"
1469.68,1474.8," hey, this is, I'll ever remember about that. It is when I was playing that game, I was playing on a friend's computer"
1474.8,1479.92," in college, like from the dorms and he had already finished it and he told me he's like there's going to be a puzzle"
1480.64,1485.28, and it's going to have a comb or whatever it was and you will have no fucking idea what you have to do.
1485.8400000000001,1489.52," And I'm like, I'll figure it out, figure it out. That was like tearing my hair out, I didn't want to"
1489.52,1496.16," ask him, but it was just driving me insane for days. But you have never played the other two paths in the game."
1496.16,1501.52," No, this was lucky. I'm fade of it, land of it. I think I, I think I, I've"
1501.52,1506.32," divided from here. Maybe you'll like three things. Yeah, I'll see about that. The, the, the,"
1506.32,1511.12, the advantage of the LucasArts games or any game like that is like they can have that cartoon logic
1511.12,1517.76," where the, where the answers are ridiculous because you're playing a cartoon, right? But if the game has any kind of"
1518.4,1522.08," like supposed to realism to it and then they have that kind of puzzle, you're just like what?"
1522.64,1528.4," Like, do you give a Robert coffee to tell the story about, um, it was also a CR game. I don't know if it was"
1528.4,1537.2, fantastic Magoria or might if he found it was the wall at under the couch. I think it was the same game.
1537.2,1540.24," Actually, it was the same game. There might have been the same game where, you know, your character's"
1540.24,1546.64, wallet is under the couch and there's the whole puzzle to get it like there's a mouse. You have to get the
1546.72,1550.88," mouse under there so you have to put cheese to get the mouse and the mouse pushes it. Right. You're like,"
1550.88,1556.8000000000002," whatever, but I'm like, can I just fucking read the couch and grab my wallet and try my fucking wallet."
1556.8000000000002,1563.2," Right. And, and the notorious puzzle that we're all thinking of is from Gabriel Knight 3 where"
1563.2,1569.6000000000001," the protagonist has to go somewhere in the skies. And so she, it's a, it's a she, right? It's a guy."
1569.6000000000001,1573.6000000000001," It's a guy. It's a guy. Oh, it's Gabriel. Not the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,"
1573.6,1579.4399999999998, not Gabriel. I might. Gabriel Knight has to go somewhere. And he needs a mustache to take a photo for a fake
1579.4399999999998,1584.24," passport pictures. All right. This is, it's more certain that because the photo, the dude in the photo that you're"
1584.24,1589.04, trying to disguise as he doesn't even have a mustache in the photo and you draw the mustache on the
1589.04,1595.36, you draw the right. Right. But then the making of your fake mustache involves like syrup.
1596.24,1602.6399999999999," You have to get like a piece of syrup. Yeah. You have to get like, trap this cat or get this cat to run"
1602.72,1608.5600000000002, through a fence. So hairs come off. So you then you could take syrup and stick the hairs onto the syrup.
1608.5600000000002,1612.0800000000002, So they'll stick your face. Is this one of the best. You're the one fucking thing. Yeah.
1612.0800000000002,1618.16," Oh, that was a better. Yeah. Yeah. Fetching that information video. And that was that to us. Yeah."
1618.16,1622.48," That became the CGW like classic. Well, that's a bad news. You know, no."
1624.72,1629.1200000000001," There was this whole thing. Did you guys hear a redown old man, Murray? Of course. Yeah. There was this whole"
1629.12,1634.1599999999999," thing where we're, uh, air cool paw from old memories. Just going off about that puzzle and how that"
1634.1599999999999,1639.6799999999998, was like the destiny to your game. Yeah. That particular moment was it kind of was that was that was
1639.6799999999998,1644.56," where we all jumped off the ship. We're, you know, the blinders came off. We weren't in the mooney"
1644.56,1651.9199999999998," cult anymore. We were like, that's a fucking stupid. No. I'm not putting syrup on cat hairs and sticking"
1652.0,1658.0," onto my lap, fuck you. And are you an idiot? They said your genius game designer screw you."
1658.72,1665.04," Yeah, so so Roberto Williams and sort of like left the industry. The designer that came. Who in"
1665.04,1672.0, fact well? Not sorry. James. James and my bad. James and. We're very Williams had some similar
1672.0,1678.0800000000002," awful right. James. Yeah. They both had some rough less. I mean, really those games were kind of a"
1678.08,1681.28," a product of the time, right?"
1681.28,1683.36," I mean, it was harder."
1683.36,1685.04," Well, that's over-simple-finding."
1685.04,1686.48, Because he could still do him now.
1686.48,1690.8," But I think they were caught, that was around 1998, 1999."
1690.8,1693.1999999999998, And half-life was coming around.
1693.1999999999998,1694.6399999999999, The shooters were coming around.
1694.6399999999999,1698.32, And I was sort of the idea that you could set an adventure game
1698.32,1704.3999999999999," sort of gameplay mechanic in a 3D world, or in some real world,"
1704.3999999999999,1707.52, that just it didn't mesh.
1707.52,1709.52, Is that for a missed?
1709.52,1709.76, Why?
1709.76,1710.4, Why?
1710.4,1712.4, What the hell?
1712.4,1713.6, What the heck?
1713.6,1714.56, You're like this.
1714.56,1715.28, Do you like a missed?
1715.28,1716.08, I did.
1716.08,1717.36, I played the first one.
1717.36,1718.08, And Riven?
1718.08,1718.96, I love Riven.
1718.96,1719.92, Really?
1719.92,1721.44," I'm crazy though, huh?"
1721.44,1722.4, Yeah.
1722.4,1724.4, I was on board for a missed.
1724.4,1725.84, I like the abstraction of it.
1725.84,1727.04, I thought it was.
1727.04,1727.44," Well, come on."
1727.44,1730.56," I mean, at the time it was truly different."
1731.76,1732.56, When you give it that?
1732.56,1734.72," Yeah, you want, you want, you want no logic."
1734.72,1735.52, I'll give you Riven.
1736.48,1737.52, It was different.
1738.6399999999999,1739.52, I thought they were cool.
1739.52,1740.48, I didn't know.
1740.48,1743.28, I did not understand this whole missed online thing.
1743.28,1745.28, That was around for a little while now.
1745.28,1746.96, I don't know how much you still want.
1746.96,1747.76, It's a still on.
1747.76,1748.48, It's a game.
1748.48,1749.28, It's a game.
1749.28,1750.48, It's a game.
1750.48,1752.08, So you could actually play it online now.
1752.08,1752.48, Yeah.
1752.48,1756.08, It was like one guy right now standing standing by a giant gear.
1756.08,1758.4, So I went waiting for someone else to log on.
1759.2,1761.2, I know if we just pushed this gear.
1761.2,1762.96, That part of the island will rotate.
1762.96,1763.92, I'm going to be able to do it.
1763.92,1766.16, And then I can finally finish this game.
1766.16,1767.3600000000001," Please, someone log on."
1768.56,1769.3600000000001, Anyone?
1769.3600000000001,1770.72, He's like the old errant.
1770.72,1771.92," He's like the errant knife from India,"
1771.92,1772.48, Joe's in the last.
1772.48,1773.76, You say waiting for someone else to show.
1773.76,1774.48, Yeah.
1774.48,1777.52, There's nine million people in one guy in the
1777.52,1779.52," missed online, begging for help."
1782.8,1783.28, Yeah.
1783.28,1784.48, Yeah.
1784.48,1786.08, So you were talking about look at search.
1786.08,1789.1200000000001, So what were the ones that didn't work for you?
1789.9199999999998,1795.52, The one that I thought didn't quite hold up to like what it was in my memory with
1795.52,1797.04, Indiana Jones and Alaska USA.
1798.6399999999999,1801.1999999999998, Which that was the first look at our game I ever played.
1801.76,1802.3999999999999, So.
1802.3999999999999,1804.1599999999999, And that's the one that didn't hold up.
1804.1599999999999,1804.4799999999998, Yeah.
1806.0,1806.56, And why?
1807.84,1808.2399999999998, Wasn't it?
1808.2399999999998,1811.04," Well, it was like, was that the one with consequence free"
1811.04,1812.3999999999999, conversations just kind of keep rolling?
1812.3999999999999,1813.84, That was the one before that.
1813.84,1816.0, That was the one that Indiana Jones and Alaska USA
1816.0,1819.92, was one of the few LucasArts games where death was a
1819.92,1820.64, oh yeah.
1820.64,1821.04, Okay.
1821.04,1821.68, Consideration.
1821.68,1822.48, Yep.
1822.48,1826.64," And so you know, I mean, you got it all seen in the movie."
1826.64,1829.68, There's this whole sequence of series one around Castle Brune wall looking for
1829.68,1832.0, his dad and you're doing that in the game.
1832.0,1835.36, And you have to you get into all these conversations with
1835.36,1839.2, with not these soldiers and the wrong conversation choices.
1839.2,1840.4, We do into five.
1840.4,1841.76, The fights.
1841.76,1843.04, And the fight mechanics.
1843.04,1843.76, Okay.
1843.76,1845.76," That's what you really, really bad."
1845.84,1846.4, Yeah.
1846.4,1846.8799999999999, It's awesome.
1846.8799999999999,1848.0, The fight you died.
1848.0,1851.36, So you would have to there would always be like a correct conversation
1851.36,1856.08, tree to get through each soldier had like a specific thing he would respond to and
1856.08,1857.36, like he would be in the alone.
1857.36,1861.68, But like it was all trial and error figuring out which one goes to which soldier.
1861.68,1862.48, Mm-hmm.
1862.48,1865.28, And that that part that like that was like 50% of the game.
1865.28,1866.8799999999999, Puzzles is like these conversation.
1867.84,1871.92, So so that it's it's very frustrating because it's all just trial and error.
1871.92,1873.76," Monkey Island was after this one, right?"
1873.76,1874.08, Yeah.
1874.08,1875.6, Was that from thinking about what they did at the start?
1875.6,1877.84," That fighting, which was so much that was so fun."
1877.84,1878.6399999999999, That was a lot of it.
1878.6399999999999,1881.6," Monkey Island was the point where like when you were presented with a car or taking,"
1881.6,1882.6399999999999, you could say whatever you want.
1882.6399999999999,1883.04, Yeah.
1883.04,1883.84, Never a consequence.
1883.84,1884.32, Right.
1884.32,1885.6, And you're always still challenging.
1885.6,1886.32, Stupid.
1886.32,1887.04, Yeah.
1887.04,1887.52, Yeah.
1887.52,1887.84, You know.
1887.84,1890.8, So that's my personal favorite look at start series.
1890.8,1891.52, So Steve.
1891.52,1892.32, Monkey Island.
1892.32,1893.04, Oh my god.
1893.04,1894.32," Yeah, but the third one was by far."
1894.32,1897.04," Like Mike, like, like, just so well done on every level."
1897.04,1897.9199999999998," Which that was, uh,"
1897.9199999999998,1899.6799999999998," I don't know what the uh, turn or curse."
1899.6799999999998,1900.32, Sure.
1900.32,1902.32, That was the animated look in one.
1902.32,1903.28, Oh my god.
1903.28,1904.48, That one was so good.
1904.56,1907.1200000000001," But even the one after that, the 3D one was still funny."
1907.1200000000001,1910.96, I still like to skate from even though I didn't have the same.
1911.6,1913.04, And people still good.
1913.04,1913.84, Yeah.
1913.84,1917.04, So under still do a new Indiana Jones game with the new movie.
1917.04,1918.4," Well, didn't they really want to go on with you?"
1918.4,1919.84," Well, they already have a demo with E3."
1919.84,1921.3600000000001, I just don't know if it's coming to the PC.
1921.3600000000001,1922.32, It'd better.
1922.32,1923.84," I mean, it's not like an adventure game."
1923.84,1924.8, It's a threat.
1924.8,1925.52, Yeah.
1925.52,1925.92, Yeah.
1925.92,1926.64, It's more of an action.
1926.64,1927.1200000000001," Yeah, my thing."
1927.1200000000001,1928.88," No, they're not going back to those."
1928.88,1929.52, Okay.
1929.52,1931.52," I mean, like, after that they started like Indiana Jones,"
1931.52,1932.8, me and Sparkle Machine.
1933.12,1934.3999999999999, Indiana Jones me and first.
1934.3999999999999,1936.0, And then they're sort of like Tomb Raider.
1936.0,1936.8, Okay.
1936.8,1937.9199999999998, Now whatever.
1937.9199999999998,1938.8, Games.
1938.8,1940.96," Yeah, they they they they they primished some off-ball their whole"
1940.96,1941.76, adventure line.
1941.76,1944.56," It was kind of I mean, like you know, from from"
1944.56,1946.24," doing back to the Santa Max story back in the day,"
1946.24,1947.52, they they they they have a finished game somewhere.
1947.52,1949.28, Sitting on a shelf basically.
1949.9199999999998,1950.56," Oh, what?"
1950.56,1952.1599999999999, That last Santa Max game that basically.
1952.1599999999999,1952.6399999999999," Yeah, that's in red."
1952.6399999999999,1953.44, Look like shit.
1953.44,1954.08, When we saw it.
1954.8,1955.04, Thank you.
1955.04,1955.28, Thank you.
1955.28,1956.08, Thank you.
1956.08,1956.8799999999999, Are you thinking you're full throttle?
1956.8799999999999,1957.6, Oh my god.
1959.6,1962.0, That was like the happiest day ever was to hear
1962.0,1963.04, the game cancellation.
1964.08,1966.48, Thank you for not shooting on one of my favorite games.
1967.84,1970.56," I mean, we were so happy to hear about full throttle to it first."
1970.56,1971.2, Come first.
1971.84,1973.68, And then we saw it like oh dear.
1974.96,1975.52, Yeah.
1975.52,1977.68, Come comes the combos in that game.
1977.68,1978.24, Okay.
1978.24,1978.8, I think so.
1978.8,1980.56," The whole them I was like yeah, I was like,"
1980.56,1981.84, wasn't like a fighting game.
1981.84,1982.8, It was like a really.
1982.8,1984.8," Yeah, it was a grand theft full throttle."
1984.8,1985.2, Yeah.
1985.2,1986.0, Yeah.
1986.0,1986.8, Ugh.
1986.8,1987.84, I can't awful.
1987.84,1989.04," Yeah, it was pretty awful."
1989.04,1989.44, Hmm.
1989.44,1990.24, So what does your plan run?
1991.2,1993.68, Or is it the Lucas starts games enough to keep you busy this weekend?
1993.68,1994.24, Um.
1994.24,1994.8, Um.
1994.8,1998.32," Well, I've been kind of slowly going through those for the last couple of weeks."
2000.32,2000.64, Um.
2000.64,2001.28, About it.
2001.28,2002.64, Give Zach my crack in the tree.
2002.64,2003.44, Zach me.
2003.44,2004.24, I told you.
2004.24,2005.28, I was saying.
2005.28,2005.92, I was.
2005.92,2007.28," You know, I tried."
2007.28,2007.92, I.
2007.92,2008.08, I.
2008.08,2008.64, I loaded up.
2008.64,2009.92, Jack McRacken.
2009.92,2011.28, I was so into that game.
2011.28,2011.92, I'm sorry.
2011.92,2012.48, I was looking.
2012.48,2015.36, I was looking at an FAQ on game facts.
2015.36,2019.36, Just to see like what kind of the progression was in those first areas.
2019.4399999999998,2021.36, And it's like stuff that I would have never
2021.36,2027.52," a thought to try or, you know, I don't understand people who like that game."
2027.52,2031.9199999999998, I was so into that game that I figured out how to play the theme music on piano.
2031.9199999999998,2033.9199999999998," Oh, you can come."
2033.9199999999998,2035.12, It's been a long time.
2035.12,2035.9199999999998, And everything.
2035.9199999999998,2037.9199999999998, Zach McRacken has has a good.

2038.9599999999998,2039.76, Good.
2039.76,2040.1599999999999, Good.
2040.1599999999999,2040.9599999999998, Good.
2040.9599999999998,2041.36, Good.
2041.36,2042.1599999999999, Good.

2042.56,2043.36, Good.
2043.36,2044.1599999999999, Good.
2044.1599999999999,2045.28, Sean and Lai has a problem.
2045.28,2046.1599999999999, We didn't know about it.
2046.1599999999999,2048.0, I think we have our next.
2048.0,2051.2, I'm obsessed with transcribing music and video games.
2053.2,2056.56," Sean, I think we would have the intro for our next podcast."
2056.56,2059.36, I think that's what that's simple.
2059.36,2060.56, I must confess.
2060.56,2064.4, There are plenty of video game themes in other like movie themes.
2064.4,2068.24, Except that I have taught myself how to play on the keyboard by ear.
2068.24,2069.04, No.
2069.04,2070.24," You know Zelda, I assume."
2070.24,2071.12," Oh, I know Zelda."
2071.12,2071.92, I can do Zelda.
2071.92,2072.72, I can do the Key Island.
2072.72,2074.08, But to do a Zelda fight later.
2074.08,2076.08," Wait, how does Monke Island go?"
2076.16,2079.52," 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10."
2079.52,2080.08," Oh, yeah."
2080.08,2081.04, Okay.
2081.04,2082.24, What is going to happen?
2082.24,2083.7599999999998, I spend the whole rest of the podcast.
2083.7599999999998,2084.72, I can just-
2084.72,2086.24, Can you do it with a baby?
2086.24,2088.48, I can do it with a chuck steam.
2088.48,2089.2," Oh, wow."
2089.2,2090.72, I'm just going to do that some actual effort.
2090.72,2092.0, It's okay.
2092.0,2094.16, So this is going to be great for someone's commute.
2094.16,2097.12," Wow, I got nowhere to do your need to do."
2097.12,2099.92," And now, he played the Metroid theme in piano."
2099.92,2100.4, Can you?
2102.0,2102.56, Hang.
2102.56,2102.7999999999997, Another guy.
2102.7999999999997,2103.6, I can't do that one.
2103.6,2105.12, And now the GFW-Apid Symphony.
2106.24,2107.7599999999998, I didn't know that was such a mutant talent.
2108.96,2109.52, Who knew?
2109.52,2110.24," Oh, yeah."
2110.24,2110.88, Who knew?
2110.88,2113.68, This is definitely a whole singing podcast one of these things.
2113.68,2114.88," Well, GFW-Apid."
2114.88,2115.12, I know.
2116.08,2117.52, GFW's got talent.
2117.52,2119.12, GFW the musical.
2119.12,2119.2799999999997, Yeah.
2120.3199999999997,2121.36," Darren, what about you?"
2121.36,2121.7599999999998, All right.
2121.7599999999998,2123.44, We'll kind of go it off.
2123.44,2124.08, Ryan's dip.
2124.08,2127.7599999999998, I actually found a piece of freeware this weekend that I thought was kind of interesting.
2127.7599999999998,2129.6," It's called, uh, Faith by Numbers."
2130.64,2134.08, It's a full-motion video graphic adventure for free.
2134.08,2135.2799999999997, It's somebody just put together.
2135.2799999999997,2135.7599999999998, Wow.
2135.76,2138.7200000000003," It's a, it's a, it's a sci-fi noir kind of like,"
2139.6800000000003,2143.0400000000004," kind of like, uh, uh, under a killing moon, um,"
2143.0400000000004,2144.48, Blade Runner-ish kind of style.
2144.48,2147.76," All, and it's, it's a 1.2 gig download, but it's,"
2147.76,2148.7200000000003, it's actually pretty cool.
2148.7200000000003,2150.48," It's a full-motion video, full-motion video."
2150.48,2151.28, All the actors.
2151.28,2151.44, They got actors.
2151.44,2152.32, They got actors.
2152.32,2154.0," Total throwback to like, 90-nip."
2154.0,2154.1600000000003, Wow.
2154.1600000000003,2154.88, Was it 90-nip?
2154.88,2157.2000000000003," Even like, that's a 3D rendered background."
2157.2000000000003,2159.36," It's like, like, the room is under a killing moon on display."
2159.36,2160.1600000000003," Yeah, totally."
2160.1600000000003,2161.6800000000003, Is it on purpose cheesy?
2161.6800000000003,2163.44," Or is it, or is it not cheesy?"
2163.44,2164.6400000000003, Or it looks cheesy.
2164.72,2166.3199999999997," It looks cheesy, but unintentionally so."
2166.3199999999997,2168.72," So it's still kind of, basically, oh, it's not intentional."
2168.72,2171.6," Oh, I, I, I, I, I don't know."
2171.6,2175.68," But I, I think that it's, the way it was produced, it actually reminds me of,"
2175.68,2178.4," like, I wouldn't be surprised if someone would have paid money for that,"
2178.4,2180.16, for that game back in the day.
2180.16,2181.2, Mm-hm.
2181.2,2183.12," So if you, I mean, it's interesting graphic adventure."
2183.12,2187.12," And certainly, it isn't, you know, a bad, you know, just download it overnight"
2187.12,2188.56, and check it out the next day kind of thing.
2188.56,2191.3599999999997," So it's the same, it's the same style of gameplay as that."
2191.3599999999997,2192.48," Total games like,"
2193.44,2196.08," well, there's like, you know, conversation, right?"
2196.08,2199.28," Like, you walk, you start off in your office and you, uh, you,"
2199.28,2202.2400000000002," you search for hotspots on screen and you, you know, call it,"
2202.2400000000002,2204.64," oh, turn your computer, check out your email, stuff like that."
2204.64,2205.44, Mm-hm.
2205.44,2208.48," And when you say full motion video, I think the fan Tasman Goria,"
2208.48,2209.84, which makes the screen not out.
2209.84,2213.12," So, they were a couple of, they were a couple of, they were a couple of,"
2213.12,2214.48," they were a couple of, they were not many, but they were a couple of,"
2214.48,2217.68," what I, what I saw when you were, when you were playing the,"
2217.68,2219.36, the trailer for that game with pretty cool.
2219.36,2219.92, Yeah.
2220.0,2221.92, Did you guys ever play spycraft?
2221.92,2224.0," Oh, yeah, I was one of the great ones."
2224.0,2225.6800000000003," Activation, that was a good one, huh?"
2225.6800000000003,2229.36," And it just reminded me, because of the, saying, you know, turning on your computer,"
2229.36,2232.56," like, in that game, they actually used, it made sense."
2232.56,2236.7200000000003, They had you do things that made sense for the fact that you were sitting behind a keyboard and screen.
2236.7200000000003,2237.2000000000003," It was like, it was like, it was like,"
2237.2000000000003,2239.52," a mini games almost with these little things, like, uh,"
2239.52,2241.12," a kind of one part of the, one part of the,"
2241.12,2243.12," the Genehacken movie, the conversation, right?"
2243.12,2244.4," We tried trying, you know, that's right."
2244.4,2246.4," Yeah, you had to like, try and get like the sound."
2246.4,2248.32," Yeah, to eavesdrop on conversations."
2248.32,2249.44, That stuff was kind of cool.
2249.52,2250.4, That was pretty cool.
2250.4,2254.4," I mean, there are some games, you know, there were some, you know, FMV games that actually"
2254.4,2255.52, worked decent.
2255.52,2256.48," Gabriel Knight, too."
2257.68,2259.92, Which I believe we gave our game a year award.
2259.92,2260.7200000000003," Gabriel Knight, too."
2260.7200000000003,2261.36, That's right.
2261.36,2261.92, Yeah.
2261.92,2263.76," Not, I was trying to get the numbers right."
2263.76,2265.2000000000003," Yeah, we did give that the game of the year."
2265.2000000000003,2267.04," That was the same year as, uh,"
2268.32,2272.64, everybody in the whole planet Earth gave it to something else.
2274.48,2275.36, And regret it.
2275.36,2278.08," Every time you gave it to Gabriel Knight,"
2278.08,2279.68," it was, this is before I started."
2279.68,2282.24," Uh, to some members right after it was right after I came on and"
2282.24,2283.7599999999998, people were still kind of shaking their head.
2283.7599999999998,2285.2, Was it Grim fan Dango?
2285.6,2287.52," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was a good team."
2287.52,2288.72, That was a good team.
2288.72,2289.7599999999998," So that was, that was like,"
2289.7599999999998,2290.3199999999997, was it?
2290.3199999999997,2292.16," Grim fan Dango was the year, that was my team."
2292.16,2293.92," And he was just the year of, uh,"
2293.92,2296.08, half-life one starcraft and Grim fan.
2296.08,2297.2," Oh my god, all came out."
2297.2,2297.7599999999998, That's like me.
2297.7599999999998,2298.96, The greatest year ever.
2298.96,2300.3199999999997, It was kind of the greatest year ever.
2300.3199999999997,2303.04, And half-life pretty much got them all.
2303.04,2305.52," I remember Blizzard was so bummed out, you know,"
2305.68,2308.56," because they made starcraft, you know, that's a hard,"
2308.56,2310.4, how does that not get game of the year?
2310.4,2314.64," But it's hard life was, you know, you couldn't deny it."
2314.64,2318.16, And then Grim fan Dango got totally shut out.
2318.16,2320.48, Was Doom 2 the same year as Gabriel Knight 2?
2321.2,2322.4," Maybe Doom 1, too."
2322.4,2323.28," Oh, thank you."
2323.28,2324.16, Doom 1 was a real one.
2324.16,2325.04," Doom 2 is just 95, right?"
2325.04,2325.6, I think.
2325.6,2327.04," David Wikipedia, we're all you."
2327.04,2327.44, Yeah.
2328.4,2329.04, Bye.
2329.04,2329.7599999999998, I'm whatever.
2329.7599999999998,2330.24, All right.
2330.8,2332.56," Well, the PC gaming authority."
2333.52,2334.7999999999997, You are listening to it.
2334.7999999999997,2336.32, You're listening to me.
2336.32,2338.16," I can probably play it on piano, whatever it is."
2338.16,2339.52," You know, we need to stand here as a..."
2343.2,2346.7999999999997," We don't know shit, but we can play any game tune for it."
2346.7999999999997,2349.12, Don't you're musical savons or your ass cussin' will haunt me?
2351.44,2352.0, Anything else?
2352.0,2354.0," Oh, we're all in conflict."
2354.0,2355.6," Uh, yeah, you got that running."
2355.6,2357.92, Got the gold up and running a late last night.
2357.92,2358.7999999999997, I was out of town.
2358.7999999999997,2361.12," But when I got home, I was the first thing I had to do."
2361.2799999999997,2362.48," Man, that game looks awesome."
2362.48,2364.48, It just looks so beautiful on my computer.
2364.48,2366.16, Are you playing it in DX10?
2366.16,2368.88," Oh, I'm actually playing it on an investor."
2368.88,2370.16, So I guess they'll make a DX10.
2370.16,2370.88, Uh-huh.
2370.88,2372.16, And I didn't...
2372.16,2374.08," I'm trying to figure out right now, I'm running into some"
2374.08,2376.0," hitches at work, but at home, it looks great."
2376.0,2377.3599999999997, So this is Sierra's...
2377.3599999999997,2378.56, This is Vendies.
2378.56,2379.7599999999998," Oh, here you go."
2379.7599999999998,2380.24, Here you go.
2380.24,2382.16, Angry Ryan's step it up for the bat.
2383.7599999999998,2386.7999999999997," I can't help but notice that there's a Sierra, a big nice old style"
2386.7999999999997,2388.16, Sierra logo when you start to gain.
2388.16,2390.7999999999997," Well, I don't really know why they're using that."
2390.8,2392.8, Because they're called Vendie Games.
2394.1600000000003,2395.1200000000003, What is your deal?
2395.1200000000003,2396.1600000000003, You have to agree.
2396.1600000000003,2399.1200000000003," One man gone to Hote, like, rant against..."
2399.92,2401.2000000000003, What's the story there?
2401.2000000000003,2403.52, They don't get to use the name Sierra.
2403.52,2404.2400000000002, Got a tamponk.
2404.96,2405.6800000000003, So what you're saying?
2405.6800000000003,2407.84," So you're a social legal capacity, and..."
2407.84,2408.6400000000003," Yes, it's true."
2408.6400000000003,2409.44," That's it, Sierra."
2409.44,2410.6400000000003, Judge Ryan says...
2411.28,2412.4, That's Judy here.
2412.4,2414.2400000000002," I say, you can't use that name."
2414.2400000000002,2414.8, Exactly.
2415.6000000000004,2418.1600000000003," And so you bring back leisure, see Larry, and do it right."
2418.1600000000003,2420.0800000000004, You cannot get a call on this Sierra game.
2421.28,2423.28, I can use it for my fan remakes.
2423.28,2427.1200000000003, I keep getting this game mixed up with the universe at war.
2427.1200000000003,2427.76, What is it?
2427.76,2429.2000000000003, A lot of things at war.
2429.2000000000003,2430.4, Something in something.
2430.96,2432.8," Universe, world is in..."
2432.8,2433.76, It's like Steve's call.
2433.76,2435.04, Those cases are in the title of the show.
2435.04,2436.7200000000003, Location in trouble.
2436.7200000000003,2438.5600000000004," You know, they should have just called the game Red Dawn."
2438.5600000000004,2439.76, People would have got it in two seconds.
2439.76,2440.4," Oh, is that what?"
2440.4,2441.36," Okay, that's right."
2441.36,2442.0800000000004, That's the game.
2442.0800000000004,2442.6400000000003, See?
2442.6400000000003,2443.36, That's a problem.
2443.36,2444.32, I can't remember.
2445.1200000000003,2447.36," Right, this is the one with the Ruzki's attack."
2447.36,2448.5600000000004, It's just the world.
2448.5600000000004,2449.52, Not the universe.
2449.6,2451.04," The universe implies, you know,"
2451.04,2451.7599999999998, that's a big thing.
2451.7599999999998,2453.04, It's a big thing.
2453.04,2453.7599999999998, Right.
2453.7599999999998,2455.28, That game looks cool too.
2455.28,2455.84, That game is cool too.
2455.84,2457.28," Yeah, that's a good play."
2457.28,2459.7599999999998, As the Ruzki's in this in world and conflict.
2459.7599999999998,2460.8," Yes, you know, both in conflict."
2460.8,2461.2, I'm sorry.
2463.2,2464.08, That's a lot of shit.
2464.08,2465.04, Dot to varnish.
2465.04,2467.04, So he's just getting character.
2467.04,2467.6, Yeah.
2467.6,2469.6," Yeah, so no, I'm a red thing."
2469.6,2471.6, Back in time.
2471.6,2472.8, That's right.
2472.8,2474.16, Dial it back to 86.
2474.16,2477.36," No, but yeah, so in multiplayer,"
2477.44,2479.04," I mean, obviously it's, you know, you could do"
2479.04,2482.7200000000003," Ruzki's versus a US, whatever, but in the single player campaign,"
2483.6,2484.88," at least as far as I played right now,"
2484.88,2486.6400000000003, you start off as basically US.
2487.44,2488.56, And you go through the missions.
2488.56,2491.84," I'm getting to, I think you get to the point where you switch sides"
2491.84,2493.04, and get their side of the story.
2494.08,2496.56," But what little I played so far,"
2496.56,2500.7200000000003," it's really well done, really structured well."
2500.7200000000003,2503.52, It actually was really impressed by like how much of like
2503.52,2504.8, the game starts off in Seattle.
2505.44,2508.1600000000003," And the fact is they have so much detail in this,"
2508.1600000000003,2509.6800000000003, like I was actually just curious.
2509.6800000000003,2512.4," I was zooming down to like street level, like right next to a tank,"
2512.4,2516.0800000000004," or right next to the characters, you know, a trooper, like, you know,"
2516.0800000000004,2517.28, based on some stupid little unit.
2517.28,2519.84," And so amazingly detailed, like, they think this engine is"
2519.84,2521.2000000000003, really crazy powerful.
2521.2000000000003,2522.2400000000002, Mm-hmm.
2522.2400000000002,2526.4," The gameplay itself are the, are the missions like, uh,"
2526.4,2528.5600000000004," I mean, as like a company of arrows style, saying,"
2528.5600000000004,2530.48," you know, I mean, it's a resource."
2530.48,2531.44," Yeah, they're all."
2531.44,2532.6400000000003," Or is it all just, uh,"
2532.72,2534.0, was it more like ground control?
2534.0,2536.48," Well, it is like ground control because it is from those guys."
2536.48,2539.04," Right. So I mean, like, you have a point allocated,"
2539.04,2541.2, you can choose which one I call in for the battle.
2541.2,2543.52," But ultimately, what are those points,"
2543.52,2546.4," generate back. So like you have a set number,"
2546.4,2549.6," and as you accomplish more goals, that number increases."
2549.6,2550.08, Right.
2550.08,2553.12," So you can like, so it's like, for example, like a tank,"
2553.12,2555.2," it's a light tank, it's like, say 500 units."
2555.2,2556.08, Uh-huh.
2556.08,2556.24, Uh-huh.
2556.24,2556.4, Uh-huh.
2556.4,2560.48," You, you use that and let's say, uh, your tactics need to change."
2560.56,2562.4," You can say, okay, I'm going to get rid of that tank."
2562.4,2564.96, It takes a couple seconds for that 500 unit credit to come back
2564.96,2567.28, and be your account and then you can go buy something else.
2567.28,2570.72, It's a teeny bit like what they're talking about with Starcraft 2.
2570.72,2571.28, Little bit.
2571.28,2571.68, What?
2571.68,2572.16, What?
2572.16,2575.12," There, uh, the starting missions, you know,"
2575.12,2578.72," the way you're going to be buying, uh,"
2578.72,2581.84, you're going to be buying units on Starcraft 2 rather than following it.
2581.84,2582.72, In between missions.
2582.72,2583.68, In between missions.
2583.68,2584.16, Uh-huh.
2584.16,2585.68," But, well, no, this is actually starting off with this."
2585.68,2586.16, This is during.
2586.16,2587.28, This is actually during the campaign.
2587.28,2589.28," So like, this is actually during a mission."
2590.2400000000002,2592.8," So basically, like, on the fly, you're on the fly,"
2592.8,2594.4, you're actually making all these tactical choices.
2594.4,2594.7200000000003, I see.
2594.7200000000003,2594.88, I see.
2594.88,2595.6800000000003, Switching it up.
2595.6800000000003,2598.0800000000004," And it kind of, it speeds up the pace and makes it,"
2598.0800000000004,2600.88," it makes it roll a lot smoother than usual RTS where you're,"
2600.88,2603.6800000000003," like, you're following a tech tree and you got all this crap."
2603.6800000000003,2605.92," Basically, the stuff's there and as long as you have the,"
2605.92,2608.5600000000004," the number of units to afford it, you can, you can,"
2608.5600000000004,2610.88," you can just have one tank or you could have a whole bunch of,"
2610.88,2612.0800000000004," you know, anti-tank troops."
2612.16,2615.44," I mean, it's just, I matter how you want to play the tactics."
2615.44,2616.72, I would like to play it.
2616.72,2619.04," My machine would cooperate, then I will."
2619.04,2619.92, Is this a game out yet?
2619.92,2621.7599999999998," Yeah, we got, we got gold code."
2621.7599999999998,2623.04, It's coming out pretty soon.
2623.04,2624.4, It's gung-gung people.
2624.4,2625.36, Gung-gung.
2625.36,2626.96, But there is a lot of good stuff.
2626.96,2630.56," And for the five, and for the five, like, Uber rich people on the planet,"
2630.56,2633.04, it supports dual monitor support.
2633.04,2636.88," So, he could hit a toggle and you'd have that beautiful graphics across two screens."
2637.84,2639.04," Yeah, I'm not that insane."
2639.04,2640.96," I just, you know, you only reason I bring that up"
2640.96,2643.2," because when I was at QuakeCon, I saw a couple people"
2643.2,2645.36," sure with like, those kind of person up."
2645.36,2646.32, That's QuakeCon.
2646.32,2647.52," Watching porn no less, of course."
2648.96,2649.52, Really?
2649.52,2650.16, Seriously.
2650.16,2650.88, That was that.
2650.88,2651.2, QuakeCon.
2651.2,2652.32, Those w a sketch moment.
2652.32,2654.88," Well, they have this huge, they have the bring your own computer,"
2654.88,2655.68, total segue.
2655.68,2658.48," They have this whole, bring your own computer area."
2658.48,2659.04, Yeah.
2659.04,2661.84," And there was like, I think I got to say it roughly,"
2661.84,2663.84, 2800 people in this huge room.
2663.84,2665.68," You know, they bring their own rigs."
2665.68,2668.96," They have like, you know, modern competitions for their computers."
2668.96,2669.44, Yeah.
2669.44,2672.8," And their plan, like some guys are sitting around the clock playing."
2672.8,2674.64," Other guys, you know, go out and drink afterwards."
2674.64,2678.16," But like, there's some, I saw some dudes like with porn on their computers,"
2678.16,2679.6," like I guess, during the low tide."
2679.6,2683.04," They went to QuakeCon, and they're on computer and watched porn on it."
2683.04,2683.52, I know.
2683.52,2685.84, I was comfortable with this with that.
2685.84,2686.88, They weren't.
2686.88,2689.12," They got, and they were just going to whip it out here."
2689.12,2692.08," And, you know, I did not see any of that."
2692.08,2694.32, There was one picture allegedly floating around the web.
2694.32,2694.7200000000003, Yeah.
2694.7200000000003,2696.16," So, that must have been so docked."
2696.16,2698.96," But, I mean, always be that he's holding a hot dog."
2698.96,2702.16," Yeah, I guess you got to feel pretty comfortable in your environment if you're just"
2702.16,2702.96, working on it.
2702.96,2703.96, Foreign at QuakeCon.
2703.96,2704.96, Is your your most friends at QuakeCon?
2704.96,2705.96, Right.
2705.96,2706.96, There was.
2706.96,2707.96, There was.
2707.96,2708.96," And, throughing that, you're thinking."
2708.96,2709.96, I'm not going to.
2709.96,2710.96, Right.
2710.96,2711.96, That was pretty good.
2711.96,2713.96," Yeah, aside from that, it was actually kind of a cool show."
2713.96,2717.96," But, you know, you're cool."
2717.96,2723.96," Yeah, aside from that, like, I thought you're so awesome."
2723.96,2724.96, I actually had that video.
2724.96,2727.96," Look, guys, I got porn."
2727.96,2728.96, I couldn't.
2728.96,2729.96, He wait.
2729.96,2730.96, Really?
2730.96,2731.96, No.
2731.96,2732.96, I guess he couldn't.
2732.96,2735.96," I just, yeah, my thought my thought was, don't you have a room in the hotel."
2735.96,2737.96," I mean, it isn't really that important."
2737.96,2738.96, Yeah.
2738.96,2740.96," Again, apparently, yes."
2740.96,2742.96, It was that important.
2742.96,2746.96," Maybe the site had just uploaded, you know, the new stuff that day."
2746.96,2748.96, You've been hitting refresh.
2748.96,2749.96, The latest update.
2749.96,2750.96, It's a brand.
2750.96,2751.96," Oh, it's a brand."
2751.96,2752.96, I'm going to.
2752.96,2755.96, I'm going to.
2755.96,2760.96, I've been having a lot of tech troubles.
2760.96,2761.96, Yeah.
2761.96,2765.96," I thought, yeah, I thought my, kind of better."
2765.96,2766.96, It's weird.
2766.96,2767.96, We're still trying to figure it out.
2767.96,2768.96," So we have, I think."
2768.96,2769.96, So the second part.
2769.96,2771.96, Game time is either wow or tech support.
2771.96,2772.96," So we've got, like, what?"
2772.96,2773.96," No, three cards."
2773.96,2776.96," I've, I've now given them, like, half my graphics card supply."
2776.96,2777.96, Just to make sure to find one that works.
2777.96,2778.96," We can, you know, put in a,"
2778.96,2784.96," Nathan, like, ATI 2900 XT, which, you know, really good card."
2784.96,2787.96," Yeah, put it in ran worse than the piece of crap that came in."
2787.96,2789.96," It was, it was, it was baffling."
2789.96,2790.96," We were like, why?"
2790.96,2793.96," I couldn't run things over, like, you know,"
2793.96,2795.96, 1024 by 768.
2795.96,2796.96, Small problem.
2796.96,2798.96," And, yeah, it was, like, slower than the old card,"
2798.96,2800.96," which you can now get for, like, 30 bucks or whatever,"
2800.96,2801.96," I can't be say, so we had no idea what was going on."
2801.96,2802.96, We've stripped out the driver.
2802.96,2804.96," Is it put new and drive, you know?"
2804.96,2805.96, Yeah.
2805.96,2807.96," So let me put, like, something that was, like, a step back."
2807.96,2809.96, The 1650.
2809.96,2810.96," It was a 1650, I think."
2810.96,2811.96, So it's still good.
2811.96,2813.96," So now that runs, okay, but it's still not quite."
2814.96,2816.96, It's still not quite as good as the old crappy card.
2816.96,2817.96, And we have no idea what's going on.
2817.96,2821.96," So I think we're going to, the next step is, like, either new machine or, like,"
2821.96,2822.96," just try, well, what do you have?"
2822.96,2824.96, The start over with Windows thing.
2824.96,2825.96, What do you have right now?
2825.96,2827.96," I mean, like, I don't know."
2827.96,2831.96, A sum computer from a couple years ago.
2831.96,2833.96, I don't even remember anymore.
2833.96,2836.96, The piece of gaming authority.
2836.96,2837.96, Again.
2837.96,2838.96, Yeah.
2838.96,2839.96, I got it.
2839.96,2840.96, What is this key to?
2840.96,2842.96," My machine is, like, worse, like, we don't even use it anymore."
2842.96,2843.96, I just use my laptop.
2843.96,2845.96," So any, any hardcore gaming, anyone Keith's machine?"
2845.96,2846.96, And you bought it.
2846.96,2848.96, So I don't really know what's it.
2848.96,2851.96," You know, I bought a doll laptop and XPS laptop."
2851.96,2853.96," No, that's so good one."
2853.96,2854.96, Less than a year ago.
2854.96,2857.96, And the brick and battery is dead already.
2857.96,2859.96," I mean, I already had to fully did fully dead."
2859.96,2860.96, I'd buy a new one.
2860.96,2861.96, Who's just 60 bucks?
2861.96,2863.96," Is this part of the Sony, like, batteries?"
2863.96,2864.96, They had a recoil.
2864.96,2866.96," No, I wasn't part of that recoil."
2866.96,2867.96, Nope.
2867.96,2868.96, Battery less than a year.
2868.96,2869.96, Wow.
2869.96,2870.96, That's a suck.
2870.96,2871.96, That really sucks.
2871.96,2872.96, That sucks.
2872.96,2874.96, I've had a bio for three years.
2874.96,2877.96, And has been the best most stable computer in human history.
2877.96,2878.96, Have you not replaced a battery?
2878.96,2879.96, Nothing.
2879.96,2880.96," Well, it's never crashed."
2880.96,2881.96, It's never crashed.
2881.96,2883.96," Well, I had the exact opposite experience of the bio."
2883.96,2884.96, Really?
2884.96,2886.96, I was probably the most unstable machine I ever used.
2886.96,2887.96, It was unbelievably good.
2887.96,2889.96," Now that I've said that, I got home in it."
2889.96,2890.96, Right.
2890.96,2891.96, But pay three years isn't bad.
2891.96,2892.96, I got it.
2892.96,2893.96, I got it.
2893.96,2894.96, I got it.
2894.96,2897.96, Can I remember the last time we podcasted and we were done.
2897.96,2898.96, Not really.
2899.96,2901.96, So it was last some time a while ago.
2901.96,2906.96, We were talking about doing tech support for our friends and parents.
2906.96,2908.96, So I got another one from this weekend.
2908.96,2910.96, You're a mile away of when you're talking about doing tech support.
2910.96,2912.96, My dad called me up Sunday afternoon.
2912.96,2915.96, I'm like trying to just enjoy my day.
2915.96,2920.96," And, and definitely I'm having a problem with my with my laptop again."
2920.96,2923.96, So the problem is like he.
2923.96,2924.96, He.
2924.96,2926.96, His wireless network.
2926.96,2927.96, He's he's on his laptop.
2927.96,2933.96, And his wireless speed has gone way way way way way way way way way down from an excellent signal like to very low.
2933.96,2935.96, So I figured right away.
2935.96,2940.96," Well, he just glammed on to somebody else's wireless network in his condo thing."
2940.96,2945.96, Which actually that did turn out to be the problem that was exactly what it was.
2945.96,2948.96, But all I wanted him to do was.
2948.96,2952.96, Was take the mouse pointer and put it over the wireless icon.
2952.96,2954.96," So he could tell me, you know what it said there for the."
2954.96,2962.96," The network and we spent 15 minutes 15 minutes while he's like, I just I can't get the mouse."
2962.96,2964.96, I can't move the mouse pointer over.
2964.96,2968.96," I'm moving the mouse and it's not going over to the thing and I'm like, okay."
2968.96,2971.96, Let's check is your mouse plugged in.
2971.96,2973.96," Well, where do I check that?"
2973.96,2975.96, So I'm going through all this shit.
2975.96,2978.96," I we finally ascertain yes, as mouse is plugged in."
2978.96,2979.96, It's all hooked up.
2979.96,2983.96, I had him go into the mouse control panel.
2983.96,2991.96, This whole all this bullshit and mouse control when it when it was finally all said and done the reason why he couldn't get the mouse.
2991.96,3000.96," Pointer over the icon was because he was moving the mouse to his desktop computer, which was sitting next to laptop."
3000.96,3004.96, So he was actually moving the wrong mouse around.
3004.96,3006.96," Oh, that was the first 15 minutes."
3006.96,3008.96, So imagine how long it took to ascertain.
3008.96,3009.96, Like what while it's net.
3009.96,3011.96, That was the reason.
3011.96,3012.96, Yeah.
3012.96,3013.96," Oh, man."
3013.96,3017.96, You know what? I have infinite respect now for anybody to detect phone tech support like for Dell or whomever.
3017.96,3019.96, I was thinking that at the time.
3019.96,3020.96," Oh, yeah."
3020.96,3022.96," Okay, dad, let's start over."
3022.96,3023.96, Get the mouse.
3023.96,3024.96, Is it in your hands?
3024.96,3028.96," I just felt like one of those guys, you know, your talking to from India."
3028.96,3030.96, Good.
3030.96,3031.96, Anyway.
3031.96,3032.96," Oh, man."
3032.96,3033.96, That's my Sunday.
3033.96,3034.96, So we're going to take a break.
3034.96,3038.96," And we're going to come back with very, very important topics that you've all been waiting to hear us talk about for the last time."
3038.96,3039.96," Oh, yeah."
3039.96,3040.96, So we're finally getting to those.
3040.96,3041.96, So you don't want to miss it.
3041.96,3044.96, We'll be back with all that big stuff you've been waiting for.
3044.96,3046.96," Three, two, one."
3046.96,3047.96, You're the best.
3047.96,3048.96, All right.
3048.96,3053.96," Listen to EGM Live, the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly."
3053.96,3059.96, Available every Monday for download at EGM Live.1up.com or podcast.
3059.96,3062.96, That one up.com or the iTunes music store.
3062.96,3065.96, Sweet delay.
3065.96,3066.96, Sweet delay.
3066.96,3068.96, Sweet delay.
3068.96,3069.96, So we're back.
3069.96,3072.96," And finally, we're going to get to all that stuff."
3072.96,3075.96," This is for, thanks for waiting."
3075.96,3081.96, And I know you've been really impatient and excited to hear us talk about it.
3081.96,3082.96, What are these things?
3082.96,3083.96, What do we have?
3083.96,3085.96, What do we have?
3085.96,3086.96, What happened to Blizzcon?
3086.96,3087.96," Oh, we can share."
3087.96,3088.96, We talked about the Blizzcon.
3088.96,3089.96, We could.
3089.96,3094.96," We talked about it a little bit on Legendary Thread, but they may not be a lot of crossover there."
3094.96,3096.96, Legendary Thread and GFW listeners.
3096.96,3098.96," Also, it was a long time ago."
3098.96,3099.96, It was kind of ancient history.
3099.96,3100.96, Yeah.
3100.96,3101.96, Technically.
3101.96,3102.96," However, it was a good show."
3102.96,3103.96, It was.
3103.96,3104.96, Very good show.
3104.96,3112.96," I highly recommend to anybody who has the, the, the, the, the, the money."
3112.96,3117.96, To get yourself once in your lifetime to one of these fan conventions of some sort.
3117.96,3119.96," You know, they are really a lot of fun."
3119.96,3120.96, They are.
3120.96,3121.96, They're awesome.
3121.96,3122.96, The panels are so entertaining.
3122.96,3123.96, That is what I go for.
3123.96,3124.96, I have decided.
3124.96,3125.96, Yeah.
3125.96,3126.96, They are really are.
3126.96,3131.96," You could, I know it's hard to imagine sitting there for two days to just hear about one or two games."
3131.96,3134.96," In this case, too, but like the first one was really just one."
3134.96,3137.96, But I could do that for three more days.
3137.96,3139.96, I think it really is incredible.
3139.96,3145.96," I mean, I would assume that any MMO or any game really that has a passionate audience where,"
3145.96,3150.96, where there's a lot of decision making going on and there's a lot of identity with your own character.
3150.96,3155.96," It's going to draw, you know, really impassioned people to it."
3155.96,3159.96," So it's always that the two years they've done it, the supplies come to big."
3159.96,3166.96," The big panel is the, the character class one that you've got members of this design team up on the stage."
3166.96,3168.96, And you've got hundreds.
3168.96,3172.96," Thousands, thousands of people sitting in the audience."
3173.96,3175.96," You know, booing and yang."
3175.96,3181.96," And I was just going to throwing things and lining up, you know, endless line of people with questions."
3181.96,3182.96," Oh, God."
3182.96,3184.96," You know, the longest pedal in the last patch."
3184.96,3187.96, You took down the priest.
3187.96,3191.96," The in whatever, you know, it's the most random minor thing."
3191.96,3197.96," And, you know, their faces broadcast on these giant, you know, auditorium filled screens."
3197.96,3201.96," And they see like horrible, you know, nervous, pimply guys with these,"
3201.96,3204.96, like really specific door to question.
3204.96,3207.96," And then the greatest thing is when they ask it and they, you know,"
3207.96,3211.96," if they've asked some like popular question about like the last time, you know,"
3211.96,3214.96," that when priest got boneed in the last patch, you know,"
3214.96,3218.96," if he brings up that issue, you know, there's like a thousand priests in the audience who are like,"
3218.96,3222.96," you know, a big roar from the crowd, you know,"
3222.96,3224.96," like, it's probably a funny experience."
3224.96,3227.96," I just had this image of my head of like some like oversized dude with like,"
3227.96,3229.96," like arm fat dangling, he's going,"
3229.96,3232.96," oh, well, there is quite a bit of that."
3232.96,3233.96," Yeah, a lot of that."
3233.96,3234.96," Yeah, pretty rad."
3234.96,3235.96, And lots of great questions.
3235.96,3238.96," And the Blizzard guys like took it in pretty good stride, too."
3238.96,3240.96," You know, they totally do."
3240.96,3242.96," You know, they laugh off the, you know, dumb question,"
3242.96,3244.96," just like the whole audience does, you have something stupid."
3244.96,3245.96, Watch out.
3245.96,3246.96, Yeah.
3246.96,3250.96, But they're getting entertainers to up there.
3250.96,3251.96, Mm-hmm.
3251.96,3252.96, Did they come up with anything?
3252.96,3253.96," I mean, did they say anything cool?"
3253.96,3254.96, What do they do?
3254.96,3257.96, And anything big in the next patch?
3257.96,3259.96," I mean, what was that your pain from this?"
3259.96,3261.96, There's some sort of expansion or something.
3261.96,3263.96," Yeah, there's a big expansion, which is a channel."
3263.96,3264.96," Oh, from this channel."
3264.96,3265.96, I didn't go to the channel.
3265.96,3266.96, Jeff.
3266.96,3271.96," From that panel, yes, they talked if they warned the warlocks that there's out there,"
3271.96,3273.96, including me that there's probably going to be a little bit of an airfuck.
3273.96,3274.96, Come on.
3274.96,3275.96, Nerf and coming up.
3275.96,3276.96, Woo!
3276.96,3277.96, Yeah.
3277.96,3278.96," So, yeah."
3278.96,3281.96," So, I threw some shit at the stage when they said that."
3281.96,3282.96, Yeah.
3282.96,3284.96, I actually rushed the stage and hit one of them.
3284.96,3287.96," No, you will not."
3287.96,3289.96, And what else did we learn?
3289.96,3294.96," Oh, they talked about Heather going to speed up the leveling now."
3294.96,3302.96," And down the line, the one, not the 20 to 60 path is going to be sped up the leveling progression."
3302.96,3303.96, That is good.
3303.96,3304.96, Nice.
3304.96,3305.96, Yeah.
3305.96,3307.96, I've done it like 800 times now.
3307.96,3309.96, They're going to give us a break down the line.
3309.96,3311.96," So, that's awful nice, though."
3311.96,3312.96, I like that.
3312.96,3313.96, Yeah.
3313.96,3316.96, Is there anything else really to say about the show?
3316.96,3328.96," Another great, up-blast confactant you haven't read or heard about elsewhere in all the various other media is that on the second day on the Saturday, a bunch of us were out front."
3328.96,3334.96," And there was a very, very serious looking important religious convention."
3334.96,3337.96, I believe it was couples for Christ.
3337.96,3342.96, Couples for Christ convention happening in the same auditorium.
3342.96,3349.96," And it was the most awesome juxtaposition because you had people dressed up like, you know, Torin, Chief Duns and Warlocks."
3349.96,3350.96, Right.
3350.96,3351.96, And there were like demon costumes.
3351.96,3352.96, Warlock demon costumes.
3352.96,3356.96, And then you had these people coming in for this couple's for Christ thing.
3356.96,3361.96, And what we were really just regretting was that there wasn't just a gigantic Diablo head.
3362.96,3364.96, The fun today and I'm convinced it's center.
3364.96,3367.96, There is no Diablo welcomes you.
3367.96,3370.96," It's like, oh, two people didn't like an ounce of new Diablo game."
3370.96,3372.96, People running out of the auditorium.
3372.96,3375.96, Diablo is coming in 2005.
3375.96,3380.96," Yeah, that would have been the most awesome slogan for both conventions."
3380.96,3382.96, Diablo is coming.
3382.96,3384.96," They would have all been, yes he is."
3384.96,3387.96," And we would have been, yes he is."
3387.96,3390.96, You're going to share money for the sign.
3390.96,3393.96," Coach, brought to you by this."
3393.96,3396.96, And so that was pretty funny though.
3396.96,3397.96, We were really funny to us.
3397.96,3398.96," You know, it's funny."
3398.96,3399.96, We are thinking ourselves with that.
3399.96,3403.96," You know, the Anneheim convention center people may want to sort of think about their scheduling options."
3403.96,3405.96," And you know, they know about it."
3405.96,3410.96," And a number of years was like, you know, not have the satanic, you know, game players end at the same time."
3410.96,3411.96, It's the most pagan.
3411.96,3412.96, And satay.
3412.96,3413.96," Yeah, right."
3413.96,3414.96, We're more pagan.
3414.96,3415.96, Not nearly as religious.
3415.96,3417.96, We're kind of juxtaposition in a quake on.
3417.96,3418.96, Yeah.
3418.96,3421.96," There was at the same time they had all like, you know, however many thousand gamers there."
3421.96,3426.96," There was, I think like 4,000 or however many thousand Mary cake cosmetic saleswoman."
3426.96,3427.96, And a thousand accountants.
3427.96,3431.96," So I was like, here you have like these, have we, have we made up women from like the Midwest"
3431.96,3435.96," versus with guys, you know, a couple of guys who are, you know, really take, you know,"
3435.96,3436.96, shower a little more often.
3436.96,3438.96, I think they're going to say like the old.
3438.96,3439.96, Yeah.
3439.96,3440.96, Yeah.
3440.96,3441.96, And quickers.
3441.96,3444.96, They're probably also going to be crossover with the Mary Kay and quake on attendees.
3444.96,3446.96, You'd be surprised.
3446.96,3451.96," Well, I talked to a couple of guys and actually tried picking up a couple of Mary Kay cosmetics saleswoman."
3451.96,3452.96, Yeah.
3452.96,3453.96, Yeah.
3453.96,3455.96," That was, that was comedy and action."
3455.96,3456.96, I'm sure.
3456.96,3458.96, The ones who weren't watching porn on there.
3458.96,3459.96, Hey.
3459.96,3461.96, I got some point on that computer.
3461.96,3463.96, When it comes to get off.
3463.96,3465.96, Yeah.
3465.96,3467.96, So that's our convention report.
3467.96,3469.96, I don't feel like that.
3469.96,3471.96," Uh, I'm probably going to more of this."
3471.96,3472.96, I'm legendary.
3472.96,3473.96, Yeah.
3473.96,3474.96, Yeah.
3474.96,3475.96, That's more.
3475.96,3476.96, It's still main.
3476.96,3477.96, Yes.
3477.96,3478.96," And like you said, they announced the well expansion."
3478.96,3480.96, They did announce the well expansion.
3480.96,3481.96, I guess it's on our next covered.
3481.96,3482.96, It is on the cover.
3482.96,3486.96," We don't like to, you know, pampharo magazine every once in a while."
3486.96,3487.96, Go buy our magazine.
3487.96,3488.96, Go buy our magazine.
3488.96,3489.96, Game from windows.
3489.96,3490.96, You're officially cool.
3490.96,3491.96," On sale, no."
3491.96,3492.96, Yeah.
3492.96,3496.96," We got a chomoli went and saw I went with him went to, but he did all the work."
3496.96,3498.96, So he wrote the.
3498.96,3501.96, Wrath of which King story.
3501.96,3508.96, And so this is pretty much the first expansion kind of like the upcoming Guild Wars expansion that is I think really.
3508.96,3512.96," Uh, you know, it's for the for the long term players."
3512.96,3513.96, Yeah.
3513.96,3514.96, It's not just endgame stuff.
3514.96,3515.96, Right.
3515.96,3516.96, This is not the new big expansion.
3516.96,3517.96, Right.
3517.96,3519.96, There is no new race.
3519.96,3520.96, No new new new.
3520.96,3521.96, Bezones.
3521.96,3522.96, Right.
3522.96,3523.96, I'm not so sure.
3523.96,3524.96, I'm crazy about that.
3524.96,3527.96, I'm going to spend the eight thousand hours like Sean has.
3527.96,3528.96, You're not so plain.
3528.96,3529.96," Well, anyway."
3529.96,3530.96, I actually want to go back to playing.
3530.96,3532.96, But see you can't the new stuff.
3532.96,3534.96, You're still even matter until your level 70.
3534.96,3535.96, Right.
3535.96,3536.96, And I'm not.
3536.96,3537.96, That's why you don't care.
3537.96,3538.96, That's exactly it.
3538.96,3539.96, I care.
3539.96,3540.96, I have problems with commitment.
3540.96,3541.96, Obviously.
3541.96,3544.96, I'd rather have them focus their efforts on end games stuff than new stuff.
3544.96,3545.96," Like it was fun to do, you know,"
3545.96,3548.96, a bloodlite territory and a dry nitritori just to do it.
3548.96,3550.96, But do we really want to do that again?
3550.96,3551.96, No.
3551.96,3552.96, No.
3552.96,3553.96, We don't.
3553.96,3554.96, Which is why I'm also awesome.
3554.96,3557.96, The excited about the way they're doing the death night.
3557.96,3558.96, Right.
3558.96,3562.96," The hero class is like when you unlock the hero class, you start at like what 50 or 60 or 70"
3562.96,3563.96, Okay.
3563.96,3564.96, That's cool.
3564.96,3565.96, That is all right.
3565.96,3566.96, Do you have to get to 80 first.
3566.96,3567.96, That's fine.
3567.96,3569.96, I could deal with that or can you.
3569.96,3570.96, At some point.
3570.96,3571.96, You'll see.
3571.96,3574.96, It'll be a well watch for a night at 70.
3574.96,3578.96, So basically the death night is an all but you don't have to grind up.
3578.96,3579.96, Exactly much.
3579.96,3581.96, That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
3581.96,3583.96, And that's how they plan on doing all the hero classes.
3583.96,3584.96, Wow.
3584.96,3586.96, Ryan got it in five seconds.
3586.96,3587.96, He understood what it does.
3587.96,3591.56, and other people weeks and they still don't get it. I salute you.
3591.56,3596.44," Seriously? Yeah, that makes up for you not playing Bioshack. How is that different?"
3596.44,3600.44," It's not difficult, but it's not. It's so easy. How the hell can you not get that seriously?"
3600.44,3605.7200000000003, That's a good question. You should have been at BlizzCon. Or even in the first
3605.7200000000003,3609.8," demo that we got to the game. Yeah, I had the same. I'm not going to name names."
3609.8,3611.96, Those are another game terminal student attendance.
3612.6,3617.32," Oh, name name. No, no, no. We don't even really know. And frankly, he wasn't American,"
3617.96,3622.44," maybe part of the original language. Not me, not because he wasn't American, but he didn't speak English."
3622.44,3626.6000000000004," It was a native language. But there was a little bit of, so explain this again."
3627.1600000000003,3632.6800000000003," When my character becomes hits a certain level, then I become a Death Knight and they're like,"
3632.6800000000003,3638.84," no. After you hit a certain level and you do this question,"
3639.6400000000003,3646.04, then you will unlock the ability to create a new character that will be called a Death Knight.
3647.32,3651.0800000000004," So, I'll be able to use my pre-skills then as a Death Knight."
3652.52,3656.44," Now, see, because it's a whole new character. It's not your priest."
3657.7200000000003,3661.7200000000003," Oh, but, and then like a half hour, we'll have to come up again."
3661.7200000000003,3666.92," But there's like, oh, it's a back to the Death Knight. So, are both my characters on the screen at the same time?"
3666.92,3669.32, That was literally actually a question that I was a question.
3669.32,3672.76," Yeah, I could throw a bullet at the same time. Yeah. Yeah."
3672.76,3674.92, I'm talking up to language bearer.
3675.2400000000002,3679.64," Right. So. And we said, you know what? This is why your country is so fucked up Luigi."
3684.6800000000003,3686.04, Crap. I'm just kidding.
3689.16,3691.56, I'm just kidding. Whatever country you're from.
3691.56,3695.64," Yeah, whatever. Yeah. Phil, Phil and racial epitetic right here. Wow."
3697.08,3703.64," Okay. So, you got it? Yes. It is a high level alt. Have they talked about other,"
3704.52,3708.2799999999997, other hero classes? They have not. They're going to do one at a time here.
3708.2799999999997,3710.8399999999997, You're going to get it right once. See if it works.
3711.96,3717.08, They said they fully intend on adding more. That's about always a right thing. They can do that like not into
3717.48,3723.3199999999997," actual expand. Right. And the thing that, you know, people are saying like, oh, great. So, there's going to be 80 million death nights running around."
3723.8799999999997,3729.48," Not really. I think there will be a lot of them when that, you know, that's what happened for a short amount of time."
3729.48,3733.2400000000002, Introduced. Yeah. Right. And it'll fill it out. People aren't going to like it.
3734.04,3738.76," I mean, you know, I know. I'm going to try it. Right. Well, we all will. We all try dual crafting."
3738.76,3743.72, There will be 80 million people playing death nights because death night is one of those like cool sounding
3743.72,3748.92, things that all the little kids will want to play. Like you. It's like when when they introduce the assassins in the
3748.92,3753.32," Guildboard, everybody wanted to be in a chastity because the assassins are bad. And now how is it? Is it now? Is"
3753.32,3758.68, everybody in the assassin now? No. Right. Of course not. It's just indignaturally. Even itself.
3759.56,3763.4, Everybody learned their assassins. I went back to Guild Wars. That's the other thing I've been playing.
3764.68,3770.68," Well, I'm playing the nightfall campaign. You're busy. I cannot get over the hump of this game."
3770.68,3777.32," I can't, I cannot fully get on board. I don't know what my problem is. I was specifying. I do respect this game."
3778.04,3782.36, Are you soloing or are you actually partnering up with people? I haven't played with other humans. I tend
3782.36,3789.1600000000003, not to like other humans. And that's the problem. You're going and you unlock some of the hero
3789.1600000000003,3795.0," characters. You'll start to have a lot more fun. Those really make the game way, way better."
3795.56,3799.08, Yeah. They make it feel sort of like a single player RPG.
3800.28,3802.6800000000003, And that's a great thing for an immo.
3803.0,3808.28," Well, it's, but it's this is like half way between. Yeah, I know. Are they like two?"
3808.36,3811.8, Are the groups? Are the people as the player community cool?
3813.0800000000004,3819.8," How do you mean cool? Well, it's one of the people you'd want to like, you know, hang with, you know,"
3819.8,3823.7200000000003," at a radioide concert and smoke a joint letter. No, I didn't mean that."
3823.7200000000003,3828.44," What? I just, I don't know why I said it. Which group of players? I don't know why I like to do that."
3828.44,3832.28, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why I said that. I'm free associating some tired.
3832.76,3837.4," I mean, are they like, could you, can you go into like the general area and say, you know,"
3837.4,3842.44, LFG for whatever and get three people who are going to be cool and not be dicks?
3842.44,3846.6800000000003," Well, are you a link? Are you a healer? No, I'm a necromancer."
3846.6800000000003,3852.28," So, yes, you can get a group anywhere. Oh, so you have to be a warrior or a healer just like every other game."
3853.32,3856.76," That's what I mean, you know. Okay. Everybody wants to play."
3857.2400000000002,3860.5200000000004, My question is do people play well? People play.
3860.5200000000004,3864.76," Showing there's some that do and some that don't. It's kind of like, you know, it's kind of like, wow,"
3864.76,3870.76," there's some jerks and there's some, and you can just, we can't find a guild that's not a bunch of idiots and you're good."
3870.76,3873.6400000000003," Oh, I guess there probably would be guilds when they're in guilds."
3873.6400000000003,3879.0800000000004," More. Perhaps there's, perhaps there's never some sort of permission. We draw you a map."
3879.0800000000004,3880.76, Maybe missing a point in this game.
3880.84,3891.1600000000003," So you're a necromancer? Yes. Necromancers get badass. What's your alt, my alt profession?"
3891.1600000000003,3896.36," Yeah. Well, honestly, I'm just like one level below that. As I just restarted."
3896.92,3900.6000000000004," That's, you can change that later. So that doesn't, that's not like a permanent. Okay."
3901.2400000000002,3905.88, They don't have a very good name filter in this game either. I've noticed.
3906.84,3911.7200000000003, Yeah. There's some people who was pretty retired. Yeah. I was my first two character.
3911.7200000000003,3915.32, They're all still there. Just kind of weird. I'll be so you're slated. They're still living on the server.
3915.32,3920.84," But they don't even agree. neglected and foreloin. But, but there was I'm a loser and I'm, these are,"
3920.84,3927.56, that's first last name. I'm a loser and I'm a moron in my guy today who I created this morning was I'm a retard.
3928.84,3931.8," They were fine. They're fine. But yeah, I'm 45 and I."
3932.1200000000003,3937.96," That's like, did you ever, Virginia, if there's all the ultimal online comments from I'm a newbie?"
3939.0,3943.2400000000002," No, he's a very famous ultimal online personality. Okay. I always spell that like,"
3943.2400000000002,3947.1600000000003, retard was R E H T A R D E.
3947.1600000000003,3953.5600000000004," Um, cleverly trying to avoid any filter crackdown because I'm smart that way. Yeah, you are."
3954.6000000000004,3959.88," Well, you dodge the police on that one. Yeah. Then kill doors. It's great. Like, you'll go into certain"
3959.96,3962.44, specific zones and you'll see just like
3963.4,3970.44," dozens and dozens of monk slash mesmeres or whatever the popular classes, which is like garbage names like obvious bots."
3970.6800000000003,3975.8, But there will be like dozens and dozens of them like all standing in the same place and going through the same like script.
3976.84,3983.8," But yeah, like farmer gold farmer Bob. The floor has, the Lord has kind of a problem with those. Yeah. Wow."
3984.1200000000003,3989.1600000000003," Well, we'll put Darren a sleep over there. Oh, talk boring."
3991.1600000000003,3995.7200000000003," Whether the other crucial topics that we've been holding out on well, let me see."
3996.76,4000.04, Where it's talking about all the stuff from Quake. Thanks. It's kind of like a week sold at this point.
4000.04,4004.6800000000003," Talk, talk to me about another than the guys that they're on. So I can't. Okay. I think other than guys with porn."
4004.6800000000003,4009.0," Also tell us the exciting it news. Well, let me see. There's a couple of bits of news."
4009.64,4013.56," The first the first one being the the actual engine itself, the it tech five."
4014.36,4019.0, The demo they had basically they had the same textures the same assets and they had the game running on
4019.48,4027.96," Mac a PC and Xbox 360 and a PS3. All at the same time all the same code. So basically. Well, yeah, I know"
4029.4,4036.6," Is that like is that bad news for PC gamers or doesn't not matter? Well, actually the the interesting part is that you know"
4037.08,4044.04," It's it's actually good news because it it makes it's it's as simple as like looking at switch and say, okay, let's make the game available on these platforms"
4044.44,4047.24, It's it reduces costs the moment time
4047.72,4052.92," You know, and we get more games that's only a good thing I see it the only thing is the engine doesn't use DX 10"
4053.16,4058.6," So it's not going to look as pretty as like set crisis or something that's weird. Why would he do that? It's weird. Well, I you know"
4058.6,4065.0, That that was a conscientious decision of Carmax for a while. He he was never sold on what DX 10 can do and I
4065.24,4071.72, So he's talked to us about that in the past the magazine saying he's been on record saying multiple places that he doesn't really see
4072.04,4076.52," The big deal with the X10 right now. I had a bit of a smack to Microsoft. Yeah, absolutely is"
4077.48,4082.6, But then again if you take a look at the the demo that's out there for rage that they're first game showing off the engine
4082.6,4086.92," It looks for it looks kind of cool, but at the same point it doesn't look like"
4087.8,4089.8, Holy crap this is crisis is it brown
4090.76,4092.76, Oh
4092.76,4098.92," Their games tend to be brown well actually this is all is actually a lot of outdoor stuff here. Okay, so yeah brown outdoors"
4100.360000000001,4102.360000000001, Like
4102.360000000001,4105.96, Like walking through a cesspool actually
4106.92,4112.360000000001, Actually was it's all right. It's like what they showed right now. They're same the game is gonna be like a 50%
4113.24,4114.4400000000005," Running gun, you know"
4114.4400000000005,4118.68," You know action game first person shooter, and then it's also gonna have racing out you know driving elements"
4118.68,4124.200000000001, So you can hop in and out of car whenever you need to the video that they put up there it makes it a lot of people thought it was like
4124.200000000001,4129.72," Just motor storm meet with an FDS, but I think they they sold themselves short in that video"
4131.16,4133.16, Let me see the other big news steam
4134.280000000001,4138.52," Yeah, the big announcement is like they're selling all their old games on steam which they're there now"
4138.52,4142.76, Aren't they that's right? They have the id complete pack or something like that or is in super pack
4143.08,4148.04, Where has every game from doom three resident resurrection of evil back to like commander keen pack
4148.76,4150.76, Which I was also playing this weekend
4150.76,4156.12, That's what these games not available in retail like those really old ones anymore well you can like
4156.84,4161.72, You need to get them off eBay some of them or you or you could get them like some of them are being offered on on the
4162.04,4166.12," Insight, but yeah having them on click away on valve is not steam is"
4166.68,4171.6," Be sweet. Yeah, it it works pretty well too. I mean I play a couple of games. I'm probably gonna check out return to castle"
4171.6,4174.1, We'll install again in a couple days just
4175.320000000001,4177.16, Just getting myself ready for quake wars
4177.24,4181.32," Do they have to they have wolf 3D on there? Yeah, they have it all everything's there"
4181.32,4186.2," And they need to get all the old um, Apigee games. Tell the cool rise of the triad"
4187.0,4194.36, There's the like all the original Duke Nukem games crystal caves and the steam library is getting pretty pretty sweet
4194.36,4197.08," They got so great stuff there. Yeah, and oh"
4197.5599999999995,4200.599999999999, One of the like one other bit of news from the show speaking of steam valve
4201.48,4204.92, They had a booth there is a valve had a booth there showing off left or dead
4205.4800000000005,4209.96, Actually it was a playable demos and it was kind of funny like here it have all these games being demoed
4210.52,4213.4800000000005, There's an activation booth is also there's stuff going on and
4214.4400000000005,4216.76, As soon as they let down the ropes to let people in for the
4217.72,4218.2, The
4218.2,4219.72, Whoop part of the show
4219.72,4221.96, Everyone ran and like ran toward the
4222.2,4226.04, Dead let the left or dead booth and like there were they were lined up around to play that thing. Wow
4226.92,4230.84, I came up so rad. It really is I I played like I went play
4230.92,4234.52, I played for one mission and I was about to get back in like going line or something just to play it again
4234.6,4237.240000000001, This is really cool. It seems like this is a bit of a sleeper
4237.88,4241.8," Sort of or not a sleeper, but just sort of it kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah, right"
4241.8,4243.88, I don't know if they were necessarily expecting it to be
4244.68,4246.200000000001, That big a deal and then everyone's like oh
4248.200000000001,4251.320000000001, You know they didn't finish the UI for the zombie so I couldn't play as the zombies
4251.320000000001,4256.360000000001," But I was watching guys from turtle rock developer work, you know playing as the zombies right"
4256.360000000001,4258.360000000001, They're some really cool stuff they could do
4258.52,4262.360000000001, So like let's say you're playing as I think the boomers want them as big fat bloated guy
4262.839999999999,4267.4, Right he can vomit blood and like when you see you vomit blood you blind somebody for a couple seconds
4267.4,4269.0, And then you run into the midst of them and you blow up
4269.639999999999,4273.639999999999, Plus the vomit also attracts the swarms exactly yeah
4274.36,4276.36, It sounds like Quake on attendees themselves
4277.48,4279.48, Modeled it after their own
4280.12,4282.12, The AI for their last conference
4282.759999999999,4284.5199999999995, You feed the one more chicken wing and then maybe
4288.04,4290.28, And these are and these are fast zombies not slow. Oh
4290.599999999999,4292.599999999999, It's definitely 28 days later zombies
4293.0,4298.92, But the game is I mean it just it has those like like think like in counter strike where they have objectives
4299.32,4301.88, But instead of having like some kind of you know
4303.4,4306.28, Map or some kind of like directions like okay you have to go here
4307.0,4311.8, It was all very contextual you knew where you had to go and your characters actually communicate with each other
4311.8,4316.759999999999, So like let's say I'm reloading your in-game. It's just oh you're like I'm reloading a communicates that to your other players
4317.24,4318.76, Or if you see
4319.08,4324.68, If you see that subway up ahead and it goes oh that's the subway we should go you know that's that's safe or like kind of like as you're playing
4324.68,4329.56, It's kind of like the the game itself is giving you cues as to where to go kind of logically without
4329.88,4331.88, Kind of pulling you out of the game for a second
4331.88,4333.88, It's super co-opter on the app
4333.88,4338.12," Exactly, it's it's kind of hard to explain and see that you play it but the thing is like you know like"
4338.92,4341.8, The get without a map and overhead map or anything kind of pulls you out of the experience
4341.8,4345.400000000001, It's telling you it's giving you all the cues you need on to where you need to go and it's very naturally
4345.48,4348.44, Almost like you're watching a movie or so right this is coming out after
4349.48,4354.44," Team Fortress yeah, I think it's like I think it's talking Q1 right now and I got to tell you that I was"
4355.16,4359.24, I was ready to go back and play some more and it was it was getting the most attention during the show for sure
4359.24,4363.4, What do you think about I mean rage as a game or was it too early to tell?
4363.4,4369.4," It's more of a tech demo, but you know, but the tech looks really cool. I mean like the fact is it's"
4370.12,4372.5199999999995, It's easy to use that's what kind of impress me
4373.4800000000005,4377.0," The name is so dull to me. Yeah, the game really"
4377.0,4381.88," Boom quake rage. Yeah, it's part of the yeah the four letter or five if you're crazy"
4384.52,4386.52, Pray shooter
4387.400000000001,4389.88," Right, but the general idea was like it's"
4391.4800000000005,4396.68," Yeah, I just toy lost a second the general idea is that it's just supposed to be like"
4398.120000000001,4400.92, I think like kind of fall at it kind of post a pocket-aleptic
4401.4800000000005,4402.84, Um
4402.84,4408.2, feeling in the fall out of the world and it's they they've consciously said they want to make sure that it's not just like this running around in dark court
4408.2,4410.52, Or it was kind of game because they don't want to make another one of those
4411.16,4415.4, So it's outdoors open you can go in and out or you can run into caves if you want
4415.4,4417.96, There's a lot of stuff that's gonna have caves holy cow
4418.92,4422.04, That's not indoors. It should have called cave well
4422.68,4424.68, Whatever cave
4424.68,4426.68, So cool
4426.68,4428.28, Sounds pretty damn really then no
4428.28,4431.32, They really didn't have much to say just kind of like a teaser at this point
4431.639999999999,4435.48, They have I mean really the truth is they've kind of morphed away
4436.44,4438.44, from being a company that we actually expect
4439.16,4443.0, Games out of as more like a tech company in a way
4443.32,4448.36, I know but it's got funny and like every every one of their past games though everyone's all like oh my god
4449.0,4452.44, The new hotness the new tech and like you know you usually turned to like an in for like
4452.92,4456.759999999999, The oh my god graphics and here this time people are just kind of like
4457.08,4461.0, Still kind of like holding up to crisis and going well. It looks pretty good
4461.400000000001,4464.280000000001," But I think yeah, but the impressive but I think the cool part is like"
4464.84,4468.68, You can have a lot of detailed texture detail like kind of loads in on the fly
4468.68,4470.84, That's kind of the the whole point of this game is that
4471.8,4476.84, theoretically if it works the way they're talking there'll be no loading levels or at least like once the level loads is kind of like
4477.4800000000005,4479.4800000000005, The textures are
4480.12,4485.96, Loading as you're playing so it like a tell like for example you walk up to a wall and it'll look like like great out
4486.04,4489.0, But it'll a lot more detail will naturally appear as you get closer
4489.96,4492.76, So you can I mean it depends on how much time they are just want to take on it
4492.76,4499.24," I don't know how much time I want to spend in my games walking up to walls. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, as soon as I start talking about how that's working"
4499.24,4501.24, Like
4501.24,4503.24," Well, thinking of a game like Quake Wars"
4503.24,4504.44, Quake
4504.44,4508.84, Quake Wars uses the first generation of that kind of tech and this is kind of like evolution of that
4509.0,4511.0, Plus it also works for multiple platforms
4511.4,4512.92, That's it yeah
4512.92,4517.32," That's what that. Yeah, it's the multi platform skill of the little thing that'll be exactly and like you know"
4517.32,4523.4, It'll mean I think to me it'll mean a lot more console e games coming to PC than like PC came into on the console
4524.04,4527.4800000000005, But I would imagine being a natural fault of this like kind of like strangle
4528.28,4530.28, It's strangle thorn
4530.28,4532.28, It's a wow
4532.28,4534.28, John Wow's strangle thorn
4534.36,4536.36, Hahaha
4538.08,4540.08, Smash isn't wow no
4540.2,4546.04," I lost what a question like the reason that Då Corre is probably because, you know"
4546.28,4547.5, It's a console game and you're like yeah
4547.5599999999995,4552.2," Oh, what could we do to get it on PC? Oh, we need a dual core, okay, that's fine. It's you know, right"
4552.2,4554.16, That's what it needs. They're not gonna try
4554.16,4558.7," Yeah, that's gets killing it there. So the lazy PC programming if further sake of"
4560.12,4563.139999999999," Multi-plient, if I let ones publish twice three times four times"
4563.14,4565.14," Yeah. So, so."
4565.9400000000005,4566.4400000000005, Yeah.
4567.14,4567.64, We're just cool.
4568.740000000001,4569.740000000001, At least get options.
4570.14,4570.740000000001," Again, I don't know."
4570.740000000001,4571.4400000000005, I don't know if it's cool.
4571.9400000000005,4572.84, I don't know if it's cool.
4573.9400000000005,4574.84, Ryan's cool.
4576.04,4576.4400000000005, We're cool.
4576.9400000000005,4577.9400000000005, Games are cool.
4580.240000000001,4582.4400000000005, We're going back to steam.
4582.4400000000005,4583.64, I don't think we talked about this.
4583.84,4584.14, Yeah.
4584.14,4585.14, That was a community.
4585.9400000000005,4586.34, Yeah.
4586.34,4586.9400000000005, Was the segue?
4587.54,4587.84, Yeah.
4587.84,4589.84, The former steam community.
4590.04,4591.34, We all downloaded it now.
4591.54,4592.14," Yes, I did."
4592.64,4593.34, I have not yet.
4593.54,4594.04, You have not yet.
4594.04,4594.34, No.
4594.740000000001,4596.9400000000005," For listeners who don't know yet,"
4597.14,4602.34, a valve right now is running a beta program through steam
4602.740000000001,4603.740000000001, and steam itself.
4603.740000000001,4605.14," Of course, as a free download."
4605.54,4609.04, And I believe beta participation in this beta is totally open.
4609.64,4614.04, So you could check this out yourself now for absolutely not even one penny
4614.84,4615.34, just download.
4615.34,4616.54, Am I you're looking at me funny?
4616.54,4617.240000000001," Is that right, Darren?"
4617.240000000001,4618.240000000001," No, it's absolutely right."
4618.240000000001,4618.4400000000005, Actually.
4618.4400000000005,4618.64, Okay.
4618.64,4620.14, I was just like thinking of myself.
4620.14,4620.54, How was it?
4620.54,4621.14, You get to it.
4621.14,4622.04, I think it's like you go into the settings.
4622.14,4622.94, For your team's panel.
4623.24,4624.04, And then you check off.
4624.34,4625.34," Yeah, there's a setting."
4625.34,4626.94, You've been taking the beta a certain day on the beta program.
4626.94,4628.34, It's just a pulled on menu.
4628.64,4629.84, And you could check this thing out.
4629.84,4633.64," And basically, if you do check it out, this free beta."
4633.84,4640.04, You're going to see games to windows live basically in action for nothing.
4640.24,4642.04, It's a big old F U to Microsoft right now.
4642.04,4643.04," Yeah, it's going to come."
4643.04,4643.94, Is it a mountain too?
4644.44,4645.54, It's pretty sweet.
4645.74,4647.44," I mean, I don't know."
4648.94,4649.54," You know, it's pretty cool."
4649.54,4650.44," Actually, is that."
4650.64,4651.94," I mean, I mean,"
4651.94,4653.179999999999, I don't know what to say.
4653.179999999999,4656.58," You know, we've far stoned on games to win those live before."
4656.58,4660.78," And, you know, we've said pretty hard things in the magazine on this podcast."
4660.78,4662.78, And I kind of have wanted the back off of that.
4662.78,4664.7," And like Mike, I soft do its thing."
4664.7,4669.7, But now he's got Valve coming out here and do a beta that's like every single thing that
4669.7,4673.139999999999, seems to me that games to win those promise it was going to do.
4673.139999999999,4675.259999999999, And here's Valve doing it for free.
4675.259999999999,4676.259999999999, That's right.
4676.259999999999,4680.46," I saw Ryan, like it was telling me that you were on like last week playing geometry wars."
4681.38,4684.66, It was telling me it was working exactly how live should work.
4684.66,4686.66," Okay, you got your buddy list right there."
4686.66,4691.86, There's a very absolutely simple and very nicely-intimented shift tab.
4692.9800000000005,4698.14," Mechanic there, which will bring up your steam community interface and your buddy list."
4698.14,4702.7," You can add, this isn't just about Valve games either, which was a nice little mini piece of"
4702.7,4705.42," ingeniousness, but you can add non-steam games on there."
4705.42,4708.78," So if I'm playing World of Warcraft or whatever it is,"
4709.139999999999,4713.98," Guild Wars, all my buddies in the steam community can see that I'm doing that."
4713.98,4715.74," Actually, it wasn't let me do that."
4715.74,4718.34, I loaded it like stalker in a bunch of other games.
4718.34,4719.34, Uh-huh.
4719.34,4722.86," Whenever I was in a game, which wasn't a part of steam, it just said in game."
4722.86,4725.7," I think it's just a matter of like, if it's loaded in the information for stalker."
4725.7,4728.74," Well, yeah, maybe this is part of the beta."
4728.74,4734.34," I mean, I added those games in the non-steam games and they shut up in my own list on my PC."
4734.34,4737.099999999999," That's non-steam games, but I don't, but you're right."
4737.18,4739.740000000001, I haven't seen it work with any videos as machine yet.
4739.740000000001,4740.06, Right.
4740.06,4742.18," You know, you know, you could be overlay on it."
4742.18,4743.820000000001, You can't put the overlay on now.
4743.820000000001,4744.34, Yeah.
4744.34,4747.820000000001, I was playing well and I could shift tab and my steam list came out.
4747.820000000001,4748.660000000001," Oh, yeah, that's a problem."
4748.660000000001,4749.46," Oh, that totally works."
4749.46,4752.18," I mean, the only thing I was saying was like, for example, like, I was playing stalker."
4752.18,4754.9800000000005," And people could say that it could see that I was in game, but they couldn't."
4754.9800000000005,4756.620000000001, But they couldn't see that it was right.
4756.620000000001,4761.54," Whereas like, when I was playing Psychonauts last week, which I downloaded from steam,"
4761.54,4763.14, you could tell that I was playing Psychonauts.
4763.14,4764.14, Right.
4764.14,4766.700000000001," But are there, but I could tell you were sucking it."
4766.7,4768.94, Or they're not steam achievements.
4768.94,4769.94," Oh, no."
4769.94,4770.94, Yeah.
4770.94,4773.5," I got to tell you, I'm not a big fan of steam or any achievements."
4773.5,4775.139999999999," Yeah, I don't really have a great idea."
4775.139999999999,4780.9," I, you know what, is funny is that I have been, I wouldn't go so far to say an achievement"
4780.9,4785.74," or maybe an achievement, you know, street walker."
4785.74,4786.74," No, that's not right."
4786.74,4788.74, I don't know what the right metaphor is.
4788.74,4790.0599999999995, And I switched perhaps.
4790.0599999999995,4791.0599999999995, I like it.
4791.0599999999995,4792.0599999999995, Yes.
4792.0599999999995,4793.0599999999995, Okay.
4793.0599999999995,4795.139999999999," I like getting the achievements, but I don't make a big deal out of it."
4795.14,4799.5, But I did think that that was going to be cool and GFW live that I'd be able to get
4799.5,4803.58," him on my PC, but I haven't even thought about that running steam thing."
4803.58,4804.860000000001, I don't miss not getting them.
4804.860000000001,4808.3," I guess the thing is, I play some games, but I don't play them to completion, so I don't"
4808.3,4810.860000000001, get all the achievements or I just miss some points.
4810.860000000001,4814.9400000000005," So I see some of my, is that I turned into a pressure thing where I see my friends with"
4814.9400000000005,4817.62," their huge achievements score, you know, achievements scores."
4817.62,4820.34," And I have a couple, I have like, you know, six, seven thousand."
4820.34,4821.34, And I feel like it's an underachiever.
4821.34,4822.34, I'm like crap.
4822.34,4823.34, I feel like an underachiever all day.
4823.34,4824.34, Yeah.
4824.34,4825.34, I play games.
4825.34,4826.34, So you don't need the reminder.
4826.34,4827.34, Right.
4827.34,4836.42," I, you know, to me, this was just like a big, like, you know, okay, they've now proven it can"
4836.42,4844.02," be done on, you know, on our XP machines pretty seamlessly without charging anything."
4844.02,4848.06," And it's really kind of big in the question here is to what Microsoft is, well, this is just"
4848.06,4849.06, just a part of this.
4849.06,4853.46, It's a little inspiring Microsoft to create competition for it.
4853.46,4854.46, It's a good thing.
4854.46,4855.46," I sure hope, I sure hope it doesn't fly."
4855.46,4857.46," Yeah, this is why competition exists."
4857.46,4858.46, Right.
4858.46,4860.02, And Microsoft usually squashes competition.
4860.02,4862.46, But see how they handle this.
4862.46,4863.46, Let's see how they handle this.
4863.46,4864.9800000000005, It'll be interesting to see.
4864.9800000000005,4865.9800000000005, Yeah.
4865.9800000000005,4870.14," I would like him to see, like, on the, I don't know how they would do this, but on your"
4870.14,4876.26," buddy list, it would be cool if they integrated like, aim, usage or something and"
4876.26,4877.26, to get it.
4877.26,4879.26," Well, you can, you can mess in here."
4879.26,4881.9," Well, but I know I mean, you mean, you mean, you mean, actually, it's a great, like,"
4881.9,4882.9, messenger or something like that.
4882.9,4883.9, Right.
4883.9,4886.339999999999," So I could, like, see my aim buddies from that."
4886.339999999999,4887.82, Maybe that's the next step.
4887.82,4889.339999999999, I don't know if that's part of it.
4889.339999999999,4890.339999999999, Yeah.
4890.339999999999,4893.86," There's like, there's no way you're going to, like, feel all of the aim of mine"
4893.86,4894.86, chair.
4894.86,4895.86," Well, no."
4895.86,4896.86, Of course.
4896.86,4899.099999999999," You know, I wish it was just like integrated."
4899.099999999999,4902.379999999999," Well, I wish they were going to be like, trillions, just kind of get everything"
4902.379999999999,4904.0599999999995," as a portal, you know, a port of it."
4904.0599999999995,4905.0599999999995, That would be pretty cool.
4905.0599999999995,4908.219999999999," Yeah, that, that'd be awesome."
4908.219999999999,4909.9, Makes perfect sense.
4909.9,4910.9, Yeah.
4911.86,4913.5, So cool so far.
4913.5,4914.66, And it's free.
4914.66,4915.5, And it's free.
4915.5,4915.7, Yeah.
4915.7,4919.0599999999995," If you have the time, I would go check it out."
4919.0599999999995,4923.86," You don't even have to download any steam games to do it, just to have that interface."
4923.86,4925.74, Just check that out.
4925.74,4927.219999999999, Feel like how far along is beta.
4927.219999999999,4928.78, Have they really said?
4928.78,4929.54, They really said.
4929.54,4931.5," Because it's like, it hasn't been up for that long."
4931.5,4935.339999999999," So if you notice anything beta like a better, it just totally, just, well, when"
4935.339999999999,4939.66," you open your overlay on some games like it, it'll notice we lag."
4939.66,4940.0199999999995, Yeah.
4940.0199999999995,4940.54, It's a little win.
4940.54,4942.3, It's rough around the edges for sure.
4942.3,4946.62," This is not, you know, you can't go download it now and think, oh my God, this is the"
4946.62,4947.62, greatest thing ever.
4947.62,4948.62, It's a beta.
4948.62,4950.7," You know, so things aren't always going to work."
4950.7,4956.14," That, well, I think that the interface needs a little, needs a little polish."
4956.14,4961.42," I've never been a big fan of schemes kind of like that sort of, you know, piece"
4961.42,4962.86," soup, green color."
4962.86,4963.86, They've got to be a lot more.
4963.86,4964.86, It can change that.
4964.86,4965.86, Can you?
4965.86,4967.86," Well, this might be a new feature of, yeah."
4967.86,4968.86, I don't know.
4968.94,4969.86," Yeah, but there's different."
4969.86,4970.86, At least can it.
4970.86,4971.86, Can you can pick for a kid?
4971.86,4972.86, Can you turn it to a freeman orange?
4972.86,4973.86," Oh, no."
4973.86,4974.86, That probably can.
4974.86,4977.86, That's the color of my bedroom.
4977.86,4980.86, Can you do the same song?
4980.86,4982.86, To my bedroom.
4982.86,4983.86, I don't want to know that.
4983.86,4989.86," You know, I don't want that thing to do much information."
4989.86,4992.86, Don't go there.
4992.86,4993.86, Please.
4993.86,4994.86, Hi.
4994.86,4995.86, Yeah.
4995.86,4996.86, All right.
4997.86,4999.86, I think we're going to wrap this week up.
4999.86,5000.86," Before we go, one thing."
5000.86,5001.86, Yeah.
5001.86,5002.86, I felt really bad.
5002.86,5004.86, We didn't get a chance to actually we all felt that.
5004.86,5006.86, We didn't get a chance to do the podcast last week.
5006.86,5007.86, I don't care.
5007.86,5008.86, I can't.
5008.86,5010.86, Except for Ryan and Except for Sean.
5010.86,5011.86, Okay.
5011.86,5012.86," In other words, screw you all."
5012.86,5013.86, Yeah.
5013.86,5014.86, I didn't feel bad either.
5014.86,5015.86, All right.
5015.86,5016.86," Well, there are fields bad."
5016.86,5017.86, I don't felt bad for you.
5017.86,5018.86, That's right.
5018.86,5019.86," Because I care, damn it."
5019.86,5021.86, And I also happen to have an extra MP3 player in the office.
5021.86,5026.82, So I'm going to be given one away this week with all our pot with the past two
5026.82,5027.82, months of podcast on it.
5027.82,5028.82, God.
5028.82,5029.82, It's like a booby prize.
5029.82,5030.82, It's a.
5030.82,5031.82, It's a.
5031.82,5032.82, It's a.
5032.82,5033.82, It's a little bit.
5033.82,5034.82, It's a little bit.
5034.82,5035.82, And they're locked.
5035.82,5040.82, So there's no room for anything else except for a picture of Ryan.
5040.82,5042.82, So giant pictures of us too.
5042.82,5045.82, So this is not an an iPod correct.
5045.82,5046.82, Is that an Apple brand?
5046.82,5047.82, This is it.
5047.82,5048.82," Oh, fuck iPod."
5048.82,5049.82, This is the.
5049.82,5050.82, Hey.
5050.82,5051.82, I agree.
5051.82,5052.82, Thank you.
5052.82,5053.82, This is the this is the Zenstone.
5053.82,5055.82, It's a it's a one gigabyte MP3 player.
5055.82,5056.82, Nothing.
5056.82,5057.82, Nothing too big.
5057.82,5058.82, But it's free.
5058.82,5059.82, But it's free.
5059.82,5061.82, And it also comes to the little sound a little bit.
5061.82,5062.82, A little speakers you can plug into it.
5062.82,5063.82, So that's like external speakers.
5063.82,5064.82, That's right.
5064.82,5066.82," So you can basically, you know, pretend like you're."
5066.82,5069.82, You can like let everyone on the bus listen to.
5069.82,5070.82, That's right.
5070.82,5072.82, It's like a nerd boom box.
5072.82,5073.82, No.
5073.82,5074.82, So wait.
5074.82,5075.82, Do we have a.
5075.82,5076.82, We have a contest for the.
5076.82,5077.82," Well, that's the thing."
5077.82,5078.82, I'm trying to figure out.
5078.82,5079.82, I was hoping you guys could help me out.
5079.82,5080.82, I didn't get a chance to think about this.
5080.82,5081.82, Live on the air.
5081.82,5082.82, I don't need a contest.
5082.82,5084.82, We're supposed to figure these things out before we go on.
5084.82,5085.82, All right.
5085.82,5086.82, I want up yours.
5086.82,5087.82, What it done it.
5087.82,5088.82, That's right.
5088.82,5089.82," Well, they would have."
5089.82,5091.82, I'm thinking of a number.
5091.82,5092.82, Yeah.
5092.82,5093.82, All right.
5093.82,5094.82, Forget it.
5094.82,5095.82, Kill this part of it.
5095.82,5096.82, We're going to.
5096.82,5097.82, We're.
5097.82,5098.82, This is live.
5098.82,5099.82, We're.
5099.82,5100.82, We're.
5100.82,5101.82, All right.
5101.82,5102.82, Okay.
5102.82,5103.82, By the time that this.
5103.82,5105.82, By the time you hear this.
5105.82,5106.82, My words now.
5106.82,5108.82, There will be a thread on our boards.
5108.82,5111.82, About this free MP3 player.
5111.82,5113.82, Perhaps we'll even put this in our GFW radio blog.
5113.82,5114.82, Maybe we will.
5114.82,5115.82, Maybe we will.
5115.82,5116.82, Perhaps.
5116.82,5117.82, We won't.
5117.82,5123.82, And there will be a contest or not for this MP3 player.
5123.82,5126.82, Or maybe just as lazy as the first one to PM may we'll get it.
5126.82,5128.82, Maybe that's all it'll be.
5128.82,5129.82, Okay.
5129.82,5132.82, Or maybe we'll forget to do any of that stuff by the time this goes on.
5132.82,5133.82, Because we're.
5133.82,5137.82, And that MP3 player will sit in the same pile with my heroes five
5137.82,5138.82, Tarot cards.
5138.82,5140.82, I have one of my favorites.
5140.82,5141.82, One of my friends.
5141.82,5142.82, Yeah.
5142.82,5144.82, And I have the contest before I started.
5144.82,5145.82, I know.
5145.82,5147.82, One one of my friends.
5147.82,5151.82, Who is probably the thing of this podcast was one of the lucky winners of
5151.82,5152.82, Primrose Tarot down.
5152.82,5156.82, And he harassed me regularly about like when the hell is Jackson.
5156.82,5157.82, What's his name?

5169.82,5170.82, So he's been like what?
5170.82,5172.82, I keep sending him emails and aims.
5172.82,5174.82, It's been like a year.
5174.82,5176.82, He still lives nobody.
5176.82,5179.82, Everyone's already uninstalled heroes five.
5179.82,5182.82, We'll see how continue to use your existing Tarot cards.
5182.82,5183.82, You right.
5183.82,5185.82, Don't substitute for the heroes five.
5185.82,5187.82, It'll be ready in time for hero six.
5187.82,5188.82, Yeah.
5188.82,5189.82, Okay.
