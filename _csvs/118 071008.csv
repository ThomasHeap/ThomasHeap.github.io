0.0,5.4," Hello and welcome as they say to GFW radio,"
5.4,8.2," Vigilai Tenth Edition,"
8.2,10.84," featuring Anthony Geigos,"
10.84,13.44," otherwise known as Chuff or Nergul,"
13.44,15.48," Robert Ashley,"
15.48,17.8," Sean Elliott, that's me,"
17.8,19.48, and Jennifer Sal.
19.48,20.92, Hi Anthony.
20.92,22.080000000000002, Hi.
22.080000000000002,23.6, That's our little joke.
23.6,25.6, Now then we sit next to each other.
25.6,26.36, That works.
26.36,28.560000000000002, We say hi to each other every morning.
28.799999999999997,29.799999999999997, You have to joke.
29.799999999999997,31.759999999999998, It's not just cordial behavior.
31.759999999999998,32.64, The joke part.
32.64,35.879999999999995," And actually you have the joke part is that for the first,"
35.879999999999995,40.92, I'd say two weeks maybe even that I was sitting next to Anthony.
40.92,44.519999999999996, I would come every morning and say hi Anthony.
44.519999999999996,47.08, And that was the end of the conversation.
47.08,47.92, That's rough.
47.92,49.76, I didn't think you were wrong with them.
49.76,51.32," One day when I was working from home,"
51.32,54.16," you set me via instant message,"
54.16,55.96, where you were asking me what Anthony was listening to.
55.96,56.96," I was like, I can't hear it."
56.96,58.32," And then you were like, I think it's like,"
58.32,60.84," and yeah, peer loads or something."
60.84,63.44," So then I started messaging Anthony,"
63.44,64.24," saying like, come on,"
64.24,66.04, did you got to turn the peer moves down?
66.04,67.6, Like it's trying to work.
67.6,71.76," And then you, Jennifer."
71.76,73.44, That was a special moment.
73.44,75.24000000000001, That was our little affair moment.
75.24000000000001,77.76," So then, yeah, Jennifer Anthony is blessing right now."
77.76,81.24000000000001, Because you weren't to me that was coming to my office
81.24000000000001,83.52000000000001," to see how, because you knew I wasn't there."
83.52000000000001,85.8, So you came to my office to see what was up.
85.8,87.67999999999999," So I just message back, don't look a while off his."
87.67999999999999,89.67999999999999, I'm not in there right now.
89.67999999999999,90.56, That's what I figured out.
90.56,92.28, The dinner was behind the door.
92.28,94.44, So to get a few things out of the way right off the beginning
94.44,98.16," of the Jeff Green, our usual host is still on out of vacation."
98.16,101.16, He'll be back this next week during E3.
101.16,102.96, And we'll be recording multiple podcasts
102.96,104.72, during over the course of the show.
104.72,107.4," And Sean Maloya is now two weeks gone,"
107.4,109.12, three weeks gone as of now.
109.12,110.28, And he's at Blizzard.
110.28,112.4, We can say that.
112.4,113.4," But details other than that,"
113.4,114.52, that he's left us for Blizzard.
114.52,118.44," And we have no one to taper apart cast and Jen is so kind,"
118.44,120.75999999999999, leave on here to help out.
120.75999999999999,123.32," And to be in a due double duty, to be a guest"
123.32,125.52, and let that thing go in the background.
125.52,126.52, Yes.
126.52,127.75999999999999, And to hit the button.
127.75999999999999,130.72," So if anything gets screwed up, you can blame me."
130.72,133.12, OK.
133.12,135.16, So let's do it Jeff style.
135.16,138.16, We've got a lot to talk about.
138.16,141.35999999999999, Followed up by what do we get to talk about?
141.35999999999999,142.68, I don't know.
143.64000000000001,144.52, I don't know.
144.52,147.04000000000002," Because you want to update, you want to update."
147.04000000000002,148.04000000000002, Jeff love.
148.04000000000002,148.6, OK.
148.6,148.88, OK.
148.88,151.04000000000002," So before we introduced a segment,"
151.04000000000002,152.84, we didn't know if it would be a continuing segment.
152.84,154.24, We called it Jeff love.
154.24,156.52, Anthony's nickname is Jeff.
156.52,157.56, Is that two F's?
157.56,158.08, No.
158.08,160.44, But it is when we write Jeff love for some reason.
160.44,161.08, For some reason.
161.08,162.08, Yeah.
162.08,162.84, Yeah.
162.84,164.64000000000001, It means something else to our listeners
164.64000000000001,166.08, in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
166.08,169.44, And it means to all of that.
169.44,171.08, So sounds like a bad word.
171.08,171.68, It does.
171.68,174.12, And in some parts of the world it is.
174.12,179.92000000000002," But so Jeff basically asked a woman,"
179.92000000000002,182.48000000000002," a woman on a date, and she worked at your late."
182.48000000000002,183.28, Yeah.
183.28,184.16, A lady.
184.16,187.0, And we sort of told the tale about how Anthony was waiting
187.0,189.84, just for that right moment when the other clerks weren't
189.84,191.92000000000002, going to be there to make him feel embarrassed.
191.92000000000002,194.96," And he got her alone for a second and said, hey,"
194.96,196.8, I came to ask you for your phone number or something.
196.8,197.76000000000002, Something like that.
197.76000000000002,200.44," Yeah, it's just not quite as even as smooth as that."
200.44,201.8, It's even way more awkward.
201.8,204.28, So now you can give us enough date.
204.28,205.64, This is Jeff love.
205.64,207.6," Actually Robert, we're not ready."
207.6,209.4, Let's like prolong the satisfaction that I
209.4,209.92, have for a minute.
209.92,212.44, Give me some kind of song for this.
212.44,214.96, The thing that I kept on popping in my head
214.96,218.8," talking to Anthony earlier was, are you chuffing up?"
218.8,220.52, Balloon down down.
220.52,222.8, Are you chuffing up?
222.8,224.28," Bubble, bubble, boom, boom."
224.28,225.76," Fabulous, underwords."
225.76,226.28, I see.
226.28,227.44, I thought it was easy type.
227.44,228.12, No.
228.12,229.2," It was Fabulous, underwords."
229.2,233.23999999999998, I can provide a little because I remember here at first hearing
233.23999999999998,237.67999999999998, about this when Alice was having her little Tetris DS
237.67999999999998,238.56, royal rumbles.
238.56,243.11999999999998, And I heard them talk about how Alice had given you some
243.11999999999998,245.76, advice on picking up a girl.
245.76,248.23999999999998, And I asked for more details.
248.23999999999998,252.79999999999998," And again, Anthony did not answer."
252.79999999999998,255.76, I feel lightly let it drop.
255.76,257.71999999999997, I didn't want to know desperately like that.
257.72,259.68," At the time, there wasn't any details to give."
259.68,264.6," But since then, hung out a couple of times, we went out for ice"
264.6,266.24, came in like midnight the other night.
266.24,267.24," Oh, shit."
267.24,267.96000000000004, That was pretty cool.
267.96000000000004,269.52000000000004, She listens to the podcast and which
269.52000000000004,271.12, she listens to the podcast.
271.12,275.72, Offered her a date if she's interested in older Jewish men.
275.72,277.08000000000004, And that's what I got off.
277.08000000000004,278.32000000000005," Oh, they're married."
278.32000000000005,279.28000000000003," Oh, we're married too."
279.28000000000003,280.24, That's what she got off with though.
280.24,282.16," Because she's like, she swished his joking, but like three"
282.16,284.76000000000005," times, she's asked me to get Jeff's number."
284.76000000000005,285.92, I thought it was all you.
285.92,287.6, She's bringing it up as a joke.
287.6,288.6, You got to watch me man.
288.6,289.96000000000004, That guy is a fox.
289.96000000000004,291.6," Yeah, have you seen his blog?"
291.6,292.6, I have.
292.6,295.8," It's all, it's all winning, throwing themselves at him."
295.8,299.16, Galavante nude on the beach and Spain basically.
299.16,300.16, Wow.
300.16,301.16, Basically.
301.16,303.28000000000003," Doing, I'm glad I didn't actually see that."
303.28000000000003,303.96000000000004, I didn't.
303.96000000000004,304.8, It's not nude.
304.8,306.24, Type type type type type.
306.24,308.68, He does say it's the last time.
308.68,311.32, Or an only time you'll ever see a picture of me and my
311.32,313.28000000000003, underwear on the internet.
313.28000000000003,314.28000000000003, Check it out.
314.35999999999996,317.67999999999995, I say we get together as much money as possible to make sure
317.67999999999995,319.03999999999996, that he's a liar.
319.03999999999996,321.71999999999997, Like how much money would it take to get him to pose
321.71999999999997,325.32, and his underwear again if he claims that that's the only time.
325.32,326.84, I don't know.
326.84,327.67999999999995, I don't know.
327.67999999999995,328.52, All right.
328.52,330.11999999999995, No interest from Sean.
330.11999999999995,331.64, It's making me feel really uncomfortable.
331.64,332.64," I just, I don't know."
332.64,333.64, I don't know.
333.64,334.64, I don't know.
334.64,335.64, It's news to be having.
335.64,337.32, I was telling this girl that we should get her to come
337.32,338.76, on the podcast at some point.
338.76,340.35999999999996," Because you know, she plays games."
340.35999999999996,342.64," And then you guys could ask her some shit in that, but that"
342.64,343.4, would be awkward.
343.4,344.35999999999996," If you should be like, you know,"
344.35999999999996,345.59999999999997, you didn't have them.
345.59999999999997,347.15999999999997," Vile means, bring her on."
347.15999999999997,349.52, We should do like a dating game thing.
349.52,352.23999999999995," You know, like separate you guys with a little wall"
352.23999999999995,355.03999999999996, and ask you questions about games and see if your
355.03999999999996,356.4, answers match up and stuff.
356.4,358.03999999999996, She plays a lot of different games though.
358.03999999999996,359.2, She doesn't like any shooters.
359.2,360.44, Because we're just going to ask her.
360.44,362.91999999999996, Like did the tough look like he was giving like his first
362.91999999999996,366.44," speech and like the freshman college, the public's"
366.44,368.28," feet here, something when he was when he was"
368.28,369.4, when he was a voice crack.
369.4,371.28, That's probably exactly what it was like.
371.28,372.12, Did you in fact?
372.12,374.32, Did you object to the talk about rappers in the half
374.32,377.68, feet in the burrito and the back seat of his car?
377.68,379.72, That's another real detail.
379.72,381.08, That was one time.
381.08,384.28000000000003," So wait, how did she find out about the podcast thing?"
384.28000000000003,388.88, I ended up telling him because all these board kids
388.88,391.08," kept on being like, I go to that store."
391.08,393.16, I'm going to go in there and I'm going to talk to her.
393.16,396.0," And I was like, all right, I'm just going to tell her."
396.0,398.24, She finds out that there's a third party and some
398.24,400.76, plus by that time I had already gotten in our well enough
400.76,403.32, that I knew she'd like take it in a good way.
403.32,406.0," Then if she didn't, then it would be like a kick to the curb."
406.0,407.56, So she was kidding.
407.56,408.36, Like a part of that.
408.36,410.48," She was cool with it, right?"
410.48,411.0, Yeah.
411.0,412.4," No, she's totally cool."
412.4,415.56," So beyond us, just hanging out a few times."
415.56,416.56, Nothing up to it yet.
416.56,417.56," No, no more updates."
417.56,418.08, Yeah.
418.08,420.56, Not that I would be the type that would ever like kiss
420.56,421.36, and tell the internet.
421.36,421.56, Right.
421.56,424.76, It's not like you're going to come on the podcast and break it down.
424.76,425.15999999999997, We're not.
425.15999999999997,428.4, We're not looking for an account of like physical transactions here.
428.4,430.0," Just, you know, how's the tough look?"
430.0,431.52, How's the tough love going?
431.52,432.76, Is that what we want to know?
432.76,433.76, That's going good.
433.76,434.76, All right.
434.76,437.16," So, you know, I think I could be good."
437.16,441.12," Should, next movie night borrow Robert has a video,"
441.12,442.96, because that called a colossal combos.
442.96,445.6, I do not.
445.6,446.6, I do not.
446.6,447.6, I do not.
447.6,448.6, I do not.
448.6,450.24, What is colossal combos?
450.24,452.24, It's a humaneous pornography.
452.24,456.12, The genre is telling me about somebody made like these
456.12,460.2, compilation tapes of like random porn scenes and.
460.2,461.2, It's a little bit.
461.2,462.2," Oh, god."
462.2,463.2, Let's get in.
463.2,464.2, Okay.
464.2,466.76," Anyway, we have a warning that we're going to get right into like"
466.76,468.92, game related subject matter right after this.
468.92,469.44, Yeah.
469.44,471.92," But like, let's not leave this like hanging there."
471.92,473.88, Because you can't get that.
473.88,476.64, It's a conversation about how different like the experience
476.64,480.2, with pornography is for young people today than our day and how
480.2,483.88, like it was entirely common to sit around with a group of guys and watch a
483.88,487.08, porn out together and how like in today's era where everyone's got their own
487.08,489.96, computer and they're used to it's being this really private thing.
489.96,491.6," Like, there would be really weird."
491.6,495.96," Yeah, awkward sit around a bunch of dudes like hoping that like no one's"
495.96,496.76, got boners and.
496.76,498.76, What's the stuff?
498.76,499.76, I already man.
499.76,502.96," But the other part of is that like, you know, you."
502.96,506.15999999999997," To nowadays kids can get whatever they want, but like back then,"
506.15999999999997,509.24," it was, you know, you, you couldn't be too cheesy."
509.24,512.96, You'd get whatever your son's older brother didn't want anymore.
513.0400000000001,513.8000000000001, And what do you want?
513.8000000000001,517.72, You could like dig out of the closet of like your friend who's dad is like a
517.72,520.2, completely irresponsible human being.
520.2,523.36, Like disgusting porn just falling through out of the house.
523.36,523.6800000000001, Yeah.
523.6800000000001,527.64, And one of those like that epitomized that you quality of pornography is
527.64,529.96," called the colossal combos, but there are hundreds of minutes."
529.96,534.36, Basically some company that would ordinarily produce like full like porn
534.36,537.6800000000001," of pictures, which is their scenes like scenes for everything."
538.0,541.44," Not very discriminately, though apparently just on to this call, uh,"
541.44,546.24," the colossal combo tape series and I was, I described it as being like going"
546.24,549.08," from a uncomfortable material to like,"
549.08,553.8800000000001, hideous surprises that we immediately kill any interest you had.
553.8800000000001,555.2800000000001, It's X from that day for.
558.2800000000001,558.6400000000001, Okay.
558.6400000000001,560.12," So yeah, the game stuff."
562.24,562.96, To start off.
562.96,563.8000000000001, Good segue.
565.1600000000001,566.0, I can't hide it.
566.0,566.32, It's good.
566.32,567.5200000000001, We were going from porn to game.
567.5200000000001,570.48, So it's not that far of a jump honestly.
571.44,573.6800000000001," So Robert, you just wrote a story."
573.6800000000001,577.9200000000001," It hasn't published yet, but that is about a few things, but in the loose"
577.9200000000001,581.36," sense is about tournament gaming and pro gaming, making it big."
581.9200000000001,585.36," Yeah, big in the sense that you see, you know, Texas hold a Monti V."
585.44,587.24, ESPN six or whatever.
587.24,587.5200000000001, Yeah.
588.5200000000001,590.08, And we both of those that series and posted yet.
590.36,590.8800000000001, It's not.
590.8800000000001,592.44," No, I'm sort of anticipating it."
592.44,595.7600000000001," And we both read, you know, the book called Game Boys by Michael Caine."
596.36,598.8000000000001, That's about more or less the same subject.
598.88,601.68, It follows this rivalry between two different teams.
601.68,606.92, It's buying for the number one American counter strike playing team title.
607.64,607.92, Yeah.
608.92,610.68, I started to get interested in this subject.
610.68,614.88," It's only because I don't know, like up until a couple of months ago,"
614.88,620.8," competitive gaming always struck me as this sort of, you know,"
620.8,625.16, the sort of behind behind the scenes of the game industry that I follow
625.16,627.5999999999999," and the things that I enjoy, you know, you'd go to E3."
627.76,631.36," And there would be like some little booth in the bottom floor,"
631.36,633.6800000000001," the convention center with like fatality,"
633.6800000000001,636.36," hooking his, his like professional mouse."
636.36,636.76, Yeah.
636.76,638.0400000000001, They tell the right guy.
638.0400000000001,639.8000000000001, And does he really make money playing games?
639.8000000000001,640.24, I don't know.
640.24,641.2, I don't really care.
641.4,645.96," But like for this, this book, a Game Boys popped up."
646.2,649.52," And then along with that, like I sort of found out about several things"
649.52,650.6, going on with games.
650.6,656.1600000000001," Like I saw the first episode of this ESPN show called Madden Nation,"
656.24,660.3199999999999, which is a reality TV show about hardcore Madden players.
660.3199999999999,661.48, So you play each other.
661.48,662.36, No way.
662.36,664.1999999999999, But like competitively.
664.1999999999999,666.04, How do we know that press release for this?
666.04,666.56, I don't know.
666.56,667.8, I didn't think they're not full.
667.8,669.9599999999999," They're not, they're not a promoting that very well."
669.9599999999999,675.12," But that, and then there's another league for, for competitive gaming,"
675.12,678.7199999999999," called Major League Gaming, that has a, that has a deal with ESPN."
678.7199999999999,683.1999999999999, They do like a Saturday night sort of live competition thing on their broadband
683.2800000000001,684.36, network.
684.36,690.6400000000001," And then this book covers another sort of attempt at making a, a sort of"
690.6400000000001,694.6800000000001," a, a spectator sport out of gaming."
694.6800000000001,699.96," And, and it's called the, what is it?"
699.96,701.72, Championship gaming series.
701.72,708.36," Championship gaming series, owned by Direct TV, they do live events for their own league,"
708.36,712.84, which they basically bought up like a bunch of American counterstrike teams.
712.84,720.12," And, and sort of put it put on this big, big budget, Hollywood style,"
720.12,721.6800000000001, tournament.
721.6800000000001,723.32," And, and that's what the book is about."
723.32,728.08," Kind of following these two teams before all that happened in Counter Strike,"
728.08,732.8000000000001," struggling to make it, you know, something that people care about."
732.8000000000001,734.9200000000001," And it's actually, it's pretty interesting."
734.9200000000001,737.64," It's not like, it's not the greatest book in the world."
737.64,741.32, But it's really enthralling once you get to the point where you're following it
741.32,744.88," as a, as kind of like an underdog sports drama."
744.88,745.72," Yeah, absolutely."
745.72,746.24, I agree.
746.24,746.9200000000001, Like I've read.
746.9200000000001,749.36, I'm about 100 pages in right now.
749.36,753.2800000000001, I just picked it up and already I'm at the point where like I'm looking forward
753.2800000000001,754.9200000000001, to what we're done taking this night go home.
754.9200000000001,757.08, I'll read more on the way home.
757.08,759.6800000000001," And, and what's making it work for me is exactly what you're saying."
759.6800000000001,765.32," I mean, just the, the interpersonal story and the underdog story of, I mean, who are the"
765.32,767.08, people that do this for a living?
767.08,770.6800000000001," And then this, like, totally fascinating character of what's his first name as a Josh"
770.68,775.76," like Jason Jason Jason like who's, you know, basically out of his own pocket is at the"
775.76,780.68," point in the story where I'm at he's already invested $250,000 into financing and to"
780.68,784.4," paying these players, you know, and yeah, and he's sort of functioning as their coach and"
784.4,786.88, to claim the top title.
786.88,790.8399999999999, They don't have so far they don't have any meaningful sponsorships where there's
790.8399999999999,794.52," their competitor and the team that they run as complexity and they're, they're up against,"
794.52,797.1999999999999," you know, 3D team 3D."
797.1999999999999,799.0799999999999, Who are like professionally sponsored?
799.0799999999999,800.0799999999999, They've got like Nvidia.
800.1600000000001,805.0400000000001," And Intel Intel and all, all their players are paid by the sponsorships."
805.0400000000001,810.48, They've got this guy Craig Levine who's a really pretty with it business guy who was the first
810.48,816.84," person to, as far as I can tell to get to professionally sponsored team in the US and Jason"
816.84,821.2800000000001," Lake has this total like, you know, I want to be number one attitude."
821.2800000000001,825.5600000000001, He's going to go after these guys and steal their sponsors and become the number one team
825.5600000000001,826.5600000000001, in America.
826.56,831.1199999999999," To do that, he starts like slacken off his law business and put in everything on the credit card"
831.1199999999999,832.3599999999999, and pissing off his family.
832.3599999999999,835.0, He's just had a second child.
835.0,838.16," And yeah, his wife's supportive."
838.16,839.16, I gather.
839.16,845.28," But I was, but understand that we like sort of paved and worried because I mean, I couldn't"
845.28,848.4399999999999," imagine going into that kind of debt with your husband being like, don't worry, I'm"
848.4399999999999,849.92, counterstrikes the next NBA.
849.92,850.92, Right.
850.92,851.92, And not only that.
851.92,855.92," Yeah, not only, I mean, whatever charisma and, you know, ability to sell her on this idea,"
855.92,860.24," he has, I mean, the fact of the matter is that he's spending hours and hours a week with"
860.24,865.5999999999999," these boys or young men that are between like 18 and 21 and me and all he has, two children"
865.5999999999999,870.3199999999999," of his own that are presumably not getting all the attention that they, that, you know,"
870.3199999999999,872.8399999999999, they could be getting from their father.
872.8399999999999,873.8399999999999, So that was interesting.
873.8399999999999,877.24," The scene right in the beginning that sold me on it was like, okay, I'm going to keep"
877.24,883.8399999999999," reading this is when after it was a, I think it was a CPL winner tournament in Vegas."
883.8399999999999,884.8399999999999," I mean, in Dallas."
885.36,891.0," There's this part where his team, you know, a lake's team complexity didn't, didn't"
891.0,893.72, farewell and neither did 3D.
893.72,897.96," And he's in this bar after word sort of drowning as sorrows, having, you know, expensive"
897.96,901.6," drink after expensive drink, then the coach, you know, the owner Levine comes in from the"
901.6,906.6," other team and they're talking and it's just, the room is just electric because these"
906.6,910.6," guys have, you know, they have all this animosity and tension and yet they're trying to"
910.6,911.6, be civil there.
911.6,914.44," And then this third guy comes up and say, oh, buddy."
914.44,919.76," And it's a jacks from the jack's money career that said, third, third team that is a"
919.76,921.64, tear down from these two teams.
921.64,926.0," And he's, yeah, and he sounds like this, he's described us just this total like smart ass"
926.0,927.0, punk.
927.0,931.5600000000001," And he's coming in basically just like talking shit like that was some tournament huh, guys."
931.5600000000001,935.6800000000001," And those guys are sitting there clearly like, you know, they look like Wall Street people"
935.6800000000001,938.2, like a day after a stock market crash or something.
938.2,940.8000000000001, And he's coming in just talking all sorts of shit.
940.8000000000001,945.72," And then on top of it, then this like, none, this person has no relation to it whatsoever"
945.72,951.76," sits down by him and makes this racist comment about sports on TV and then, you know,"
951.76,954.5200000000001, lake almost gets into a fist fight with him.
954.5200000000001,958.6," And it's just like just from there on, it's like this is just good storytelling and like"
958.6,960.96, good reporting on what's going on with these.
960.96,961.96, Yeah.
961.96,967.6400000000001," And the guy, I interviewed Michael Kane the writer and he's his advanced to,"
968.12,973.28, to drive around the country and meet the kids and the coaches from both of these teams.
973.28,976.6," And they're all over the, all over the country because they don't, you know,"
976.6,977.36, practice together.
977.36,979.96, They're just like internet friends and they get together for these tournaments.
980.68,985.24," And he really, I think, got to know most of the kids really well enough for you to be"
985.24,989.64, able by the end of the book to differentiate everyone's personal story and feel that each
989.64,992.04, person has like a stake in what they're doing.
992.04,993.76, And I thought that was pretty interesting.
993.76,998.76," I mean, I think it's probably pretty difficult to figure out what separates, you know,"
998.76,1000.96, ten counter strike players from one another.
1000.96,1002.52," I mean, gamers aren't exactly."
1002.52,1008.76," And it works for like there's, there's the, um, the 3D guy who was Rambo, he was previously"
1008.76,1010.4399999999999, like the tactician for the team.
1010.4399999999999,1014.52," And he was kind of bumped down some moto, the other player could step in and he had an entirely"
1014.52,1015.52, different way about it.
1015.52,1018.72," Whereas like Rambo's like approach is like, we're good players."
1018.72,1020.0, We just go in and play well.
1020.0,1023.0, Let's just be comfortable and do what we do.
1023.0,1026.8, And his replacement moto is very much about this is our playbook.
1026.8,1028.88, We're going to practice it over and over and over again.
1028.88,1032.48, And I'm going to yell at you until you get it right.
1032.48,1037.76," It's going to be all about, you know, strategy and deception and only sorts of things."
1037.76,1041.04," And so you see the difference not only in their style, but in how people are reacting to"
1041.04,1042.04, them.
1042.04,1044.52," I mean, you're hearing like meanwhile, this, this other scene that I just read through,"
1044.52,1048.6," you know, they're in the cyber cafe trying to practice and half of them are paying attention"
1048.6,1049.6, to other things.
1049.6,1053.32, There's a guy in the parking lot who gets on the phone and finds out someone offered
1053.32,1055.48, to give his girlfriend a tattoo for a blowjob.
1055.48,1059.6399999999999," So he during the course of the same scene goes down to the tattoo parlor, punches the"
1059.6399999999999,1062.32, guy in the face and it comes back to practice.
1062.32,1063.32," Yeah, that's, that's a guy."
1063.32,1066.36, Then there's going to smoke and dope in the car and they come in.
1066.36,1067.36, Yeah.
1067.36,1071.04," Yeah, that was a guy from a, from a different team, Muggin Mouse from Dow."
1071.04,1072.04, He was a local team.
1072.04,1073.04, He was a local team.
1073.04,1075.36, And actually I talked to that guy for this story.
1075.36,1076.36," Oh, yeah."
1076.36,1077.36, Yeah.
1077.36,1083.12, Like he had gone to Kuwait to be a contractor during the wars.
1083.12,1084.12, Right.
1084.12,1087.8799999999999," And ended up stopping through, yeah, and he, in Southeast Asia."
1087.8799999999999,1088.8799999999999, Yeah.
1088.8799999999999,1093.6, And he ended up playing for the world tournament of championship gaming series from
1093.6,1094.6, the Kuwait team.
1094.6,1099.24," I didn't realize that they had like international teams, but apparently they have like a big"
1099.24,1100.8799999999999, international event at the end of each other.
1100.8799999999999,1102.6, So he played for the Kuwait team?
1102.6,1103.6, Yeah.
1103.6,1104.6, Because he was in Kuwait.
1104.6,1107.1599999999999, Like so as a contractor.
1107.16,1111.16," And that's when I found out that actually the rock had a counter strike team, but couldn't"
1111.16,1115.48, get the visas to to leave the country and play.
1115.48,1119.96," Which would have been a killer story if I'd found out about it, you know, not six months"
1119.96,1120.96, later.
1120.96,1121.96, Right.
1121.96,1126.28," So, but yeah, that guy is really interesting, interesting kid."
1126.28,1130.52," But yeah, there are all sorts of, you know, really, really fun scenes in the book."
1130.52,1135.6000000000001," And the thing that amazed me most was just the fact that the sky, who was not a gamer,"
1135.6000000000001,1137.1200000000001," Michael Kane, he's not really in."
1137.12,1139.6," Into games per se, the sports writer."
1139.6,1145.28, He manages to get in there and figure out what makes counter strike enjoyable to watch and
1145.28,1146.28, to observe.
1146.28,1151.0," And he sort of, you know, gets it down to the level of being able to describe a game, play"
1151.0,1154.1599999999999, by play and make you excited about what's going on in it.
1154.1599999999999,1157.8," You know, you feel like some actual tension like you would, if you're reading about like"
1157.8,1161.08, a big like football game or a basketball game or something.
1161.08,1163.0, It shows you the strength of like good reporting.
1163.0,1166.9599999999998," I mean, you know, you might end up going and doing a piece on like a national"
1166.96,1167.96, research laboratory.
1167.96,1172.24," You may not be a physicist yourself, but a good reporter is going to be able to communicate"
1172.24,1176.32," that and then other physicists can read it and say, yes, this, this checks out."
1176.32,1178.8400000000001, We were saying there are a few instances in this book.
1178.8400000000001,1180.52, I'll know why you can note another way.
1180.52,1185.1200000000001," I think someone who's like, you know, identifies himself as a hardcore gamer, will raise"
1185.1200000000001,1187.56, and eyebrow and the danger of staying.
1187.56,1189.88," I don't know if this is a correct, this is a corrected copy."
1189.88,1190.88, That's it.
1190.88,1191.88, My copy is uncrerected.
1191.88,1192.88, Okay.
1192.88,1194.72," I'm looking at a corrected copy, I think."
1194.72,1200.08," And right in the introduction, there's the statement that in September 2007, the game"
1200.08,1205.1200000000001, Halo 3 released with a record 4.2 billion units on store shelves and it's first 24
1205.1200000000001,1206.84, hours.
1206.84,1213.08," And if you do the math there, I think that means that every man, woman, a child who lives"
1213.08,1216.32, above like the subsistence level in the world.
1216.32,1220.8," And then many people who live below subsistence, all got themselves a copy."
1220.8,1221.8, I hate it.
1221.8,1223.16, I got themselves two copies of it.
1223.16,1224.16," Yes, three copies."
1224.16,1228.72," Yeah, I mean, that's just one of the things where like a gamer is going to get caught up"
1228.72,1231.3600000000001," immediately like reading that and think, oh, this is bullshit."
1231.3600000000001,1237.64," I mean, it's hard to report on games if the audience is so, you know, you just, you"
1237.64,1241.3200000000002, trip the bullshit detectors with credibility right off the floor.
1241.3200000000002,1244.24," But after that though, like you got another one, I want to let you go."
1244.24,1249.6000000000001," And there's a lot, as far as like if you're reading this as a gamer, there's a lot of"
1249.6,1254.8799999999999," sort of repetitive instances of pinpointing out the gamers aren't in fact, um, sociopathic,"
1254.8799999999999,1260.1999999999998," pimpley, uh, basement bound teenagers who, you know, want to kill people."
1260.1999999999998,1261.1999999999998, Right.
1261.1999999999998,1262.84, And that's always presented as like a surprise.
1262.84,1263.84," Like, who knew?"
1263.84,1264.84, Who knew?
1264.84,1267.9599999999998," I thought that's, and that story's told over and over again."
1267.9599999999998,1270.4399999999998," Yeah, and I got the feeling that that was like a piece, you know."
1270.4399999999998,1273.24," Yeah, I got the feeling that that was something coming down from his editor."
1273.24,1275.48," They like, they, he had to really explain."
1275.48,1277.12, And he could imagine that.
1277.12,1278.12, Yeah.
1278.1599999999999,1284.12," The other thing is, the other thing is a little, um, a little, a little bit more"
1284.12,1289.4399999999998," funny to me, like there's, there's some discussion of, uh, how, I mean, how counter strike"
1289.4399999999998,1290.4399999999998, was born.
1290.4399999999998,1291.4399999999998, It was a half-life mod.
1291.4399999999998,1298.08," And he tries to explain the significance of mods and, and the gaming scene and gives"
1298.08,1302.2399999999998," a short history of, uh, of the, the phenomenon."
1302.2399999999998,1303.2399999999998, So I'll just read this.
1303.24,1307.72," At 1998, the Counter Strike phenomenon began inconspicuously with the release of a"
1307.72,1309.36, game called Half-Life.
1309.36,1314.24," By the late 90s, Internet speed advanced to a point where online links existed for the"
1314.24,1317.68, most popular first-person shooter games like Doom and Quake.
1317.68,1322.56," Half-Life was something of a poor man's Quake, a decent one-on-one shooter, but with nothing"
1322.56,1324.68, on the surface revolutionary.
1324.68,1328.92," Uh, what was the revolutionary was the presence of its, uh, the presence of its developer"
1329.0,1333.04, valve software and allowing players to mod the game.
1333.04,1338.02," And it's just funny, like if you, you know, follow Half-Life to think of it as like a"
1338.02,1339.02, poor man's Quake.
1339.02,1344.5," But beyond that, the thing there, in his defense, if he's referring to Half-Life as a"
1344.5,1348.64," multiplayer game, any thinking of like Half-Life death match, yeah."
1348.64,1352.04," Like someone could put, put, put that argument, you know, yeah."
1352.04,1357.8400000000001," And, but then again, the one it says that it invented modding and that, and that when, um,"
1357.9199999999998,1361.8799999999999," which isn't the case, you know, but also like, yeah, that, the, I mean, that's your placement"
1361.8799999999999,1363.6399999999999," of, of, of Half-Life universe."
1363.6399999999999,1366.04," So like for us, you read that, you kind of like trip up on it."
1366.04,1370.04," But the thing for me, though, is that aside from those sorts of, you know, little"
1370.04,1374.1999999999998," blunders, yeah, he's able, like you were, you were saying, you know, to praise him,"
1374.1999999999998,1378.0," to have such a firm grasp, not only on the people who play Counter Strike, but how the"
1378.0,1382.36," game itself works, but to communicate it in language that our parents can understand"
1382.36,1384.3999999999999," and feel like, I know how this game works."
1384.48,1388.76," Now, if I go and watch Sean or Robert play this game, like, it's not going to be a complete"
1388.76,1389.76, mystery to me anymore.
1389.76,1390.76, Yeah.
1390.76,1394.3600000000001," And it's not just of saying like, because it would really be easy, right, to describe what"
1394.3600000000001,1398.3200000000002," first person point of view means in game language, and then to say that people's had"
1398.3200000000002,1400.96, to get blown off and they died and then people could angry at that point.
1400.96,1405.92," But to really work out the way that we use terminology, like ramp room and banana for parts"
1405.92,1410.4," of the map, the ways that like concealment cover work with flash bangs with the crates."
1411.3200000000002,1414.92," And identifying the different roles that people are playing on the team, like he"
1414.92,1420.88," really goes into the teamwork aspect of Counter Strike and how that makes it, you know,"
1420.88,1424.76, more interesting to follow because you do have players playing these different roles.
1424.76,1429.96," And he goes a lot into talking about the sky fraud, who, you know, I had never followed"
1429.96,1433.52," the stuff before reading this book, but the king of the operes."
1433.64,1437.6000000000001," Yeah, yeah, basically like just an incredibly amazing sniper."
1437.84,1444.04, And a lot of the narrative in describing these like big championship games that he talks
1444.04,1449.84," about in the, and the book is focused on, you know, him like pulling off the great shot,"
1449.84,1452.76, like at the last minute or like losing his game.
1452.76,1454.6," And now everyone's like, oh, God, what are we going to do?"
1454.6,1458.32," Fraud's done, you know, it's just like the sport you live with his, you know, with his"
1458.32,1463.7199999999998," ego mania, because he's got the highest killed eth ratio in the nation, dealing like with"
1463.8,1468.52," his morale because their playbook is largely designed around supporting, allowing giving him"
1468.52,1471.76, the platform to excel in the way that he uniquely does.
1472.04,1476.84," And then when you start to pull out, you know, bits of that support system and the whole thing"
1476.84,1477.64, collapses.
1477.64,1477.84, Right.
1478.04,1478.32, Yeah.
1478.72,1480.96, I think let's turn into something general though.
1480.96,1484.32," I wanted to like, you know, put this out there for all of us, like you, you can answer"
1484.32,1487.6000000000001, this question in the context of having read the book and someone trying to convince you.
1487.6000000000001,1491.64," And then, you know, for Robert and Jen, whatever you think, but would you be interested"
1491.64,1497.48," in watching, you know, following these kind of games televised and then another thing to throw"
1497.48,1502.5600000000002," in there too is that like, or maybe even not just televised, but in some other capacity,"
1502.5600000000002,1505.96," because uniquely with these games as opposed to, you know, when you're watching a replay"
1505.96,1509.88," of football, I mean, you can actually spectate live in the game and move the cat."
1509.88,1511.5600000000002, You can be your own camera person.
1511.5600000000002,1513.72, You can put your camera in the eyes of another player.
1513.72,1516.6000000000001, You can do anything rewind and fast forward as you want.
1516.6000000000001,1517.88, So there's a couple different options.
1518.1200000000001,1522.1200000000001," But I mean, and in the bigger picture, do you think that this is going to are these guys?"
1522.1200000000001,1525.6000000000001," I mean, do they have a hope in heaven of making it big?"
1525.6000000000001,1529.8000000000002, Big in the sense that it's like snowboarding on ESPN or something within the next five years?
1529.8000000000002,1535.16," I mean, the freedoms that you talk about are actually, we'll probably heard it in that regard"
1535.16,1543.16," because as somebody who has in the last like five to eight years got really into football on TV,"
1543.16,1544.16, like that's me.
1544.16,1548.68, And it's only because I've had people in the room with me able to explain why things are
1548.68,1555.1200000000001, significant and explain the plot of the game so that it didn't take me too long to figure
1555.1200000000001,1556.1200000000001, out the rules.
1556.1200000000001,1560.3200000000002," I mean, I learned the rules a long time ago, but I never enjoyed watching it until I understood"
1560.3200000000002,1561.92, the intricacies of it.
1561.92,1567.44," So if I don't have somebody doing that, then it's going to be tough."
1567.44,1571.0800000000002," What if it was televised in a way that you had someone with, you know, with the power"
1571.08,1575.32, of explanation that Michael Kane has here and someone's able to hide out.
1575.32,1580.52," I think that when there's whenever there's a genuine story, which it sounds like this"
1580.52,1586.08," guy has the ability to do and that there is, then there's drama."
1586.08,1587.72, That's what you want.
1587.72,1592.8799999999999," So I mean, I was actually thinking as you guys were talking, this sounds like the King of"
1592.8799999999999,1596.8," Kong crew from movie crews next, next open."
1596.8,1602.6," You know, like they need to find all these people and go and follow them on their next"
1602.6,1604.1599999999999," you know, crusade or whatever."
1604.1599999999999,1612.0," So I mean, as long as there's a plot, then yeah, I think that there may be some problem"
1612.0,1617.3999999999999," though, and when you're not watching people, I mean, what the when the plot involves say"
1617.3999999999999,1621.8, in 19 year old who hasn't worked a day in his life.
1621.8,1627.56," I mean, I don't think, you know, that's that has nothing to do with it personally."
1627.56,1633.84," Because like, I mean, any specialized competitive thing or really any specialized feeling,"
1633.84,1641.0," I mean, people don't care of the the history behind like that Kobayashi guy, you know,"
1641.0,1643.28, the champion hot dog eater guy.
1643.28,1646.28," I mean, that's just like fascinating."
1646.28,1648.9199999999998, You don't even need somebody to explain the story.
1648.9199999999998,1650.12, You just want to watch it.
1650.12,1652.7199999999998," So like, you don't care really who's doing it."
1652.7199999999998,1657.12," All you care is like, wow, they have skills that I can't fathom."
1657.12,1661.8," You know, it that he cares about it and that he like identifies like his sense of self"
1661.8,1663.3999999999999, work with how many hot dogs he can eat.
1663.3999999999999,1667.6399999999999," How many like, you know, how many people he can hit with his op."
1667.6399999999999,1672.8," I mean, on the other side of that, I think part of what makes a professional gaming or"
1672.8,1675.32, competitive gaming as a spectator sport.
1675.3999999999999,1680.8, Interesting is that it's accessible to the audience in ways that football or basketball
1680.8,1686.52," really isn't, you know, by the time you're 14 years old, you know, you're not going to be"
1686.52,1688.4399999999998, a professional basketball player.
1688.4399999999998,1690.0," You know, you're not going to be in the NFL."
1690.0,1691.6399999999999," You know, you're not going to have a chance."
1691.6399999999999,1693.6799999999998," And you know, by the time you're doing yourself."
1693.6799999999998,1697.6399999999999," No, but I mean, by the time you're 20, if you were any good at all, then you know, for sure."
1697.6399999999999,1702.8," But when it comes to games, like, people really can, you know, get in there and practice"
1702.8,1708.9199999999998, and see how good they are playing the exact same game that the professionals are playing.
1708.9199999999998,1715.8," And I think that aspect, like the fact that you could interact and maybe, you know, sign"
1715.8,1721.1599999999999," up for one of these tournaments, like majorly gaming does a tournament circuit that is related"
1721.1599999999999,1723.8799999999999, to their whole thing where they go to different cities.
1723.8799999999999,1726.3999999999999, And you can sign up to try to make your way.
1726.3999999999999,1727.3999999999999, And that's cool.
1727.3999999999999,1732.48," I mean, I think that's an interesting thing that other sports don't have."
1732.48,1738.24," But yeah, I think the big challenge is going to be getting people to understand the game"
1738.24,1739.52, because it is complicated.
1739.52,1743.44," Like counter strikes pretty complicated, especially because it's really fast."
1743.44,1746.2," Then he people to slow it down and say, whoa, do you see that?"
1746.2,1747.8," Like, that was really cool."
1747.8,1753.08," But I mean, if you're just saying they're watching five screens of people playing Counter"
1753.08,1754.96," Strike, it just looks like chaos."
1754.96,1755.96, Right.
1755.96,1759.32," And this, I think the same way too, if you were to watch like some sports, you know, some"
1759.32,1762.4," sports more than others, it would look like it's just a bunch of"
1762.4,1764.8400000000001, people running around and kicking them ball.
1764.8400000000001,1768.6000000000001," If you were it for Mars, you know, and in the same way, you look at Counter Strike or any"
1768.6000000000001,1772.48," of you have seen all it looks like is bang, bang, bang, bang, bang."
1772.48,1774.88," So it's like, yeah, okay, it's people shooting guns."
1774.88,1780.0," You know, and you don't understand that actually there's, you know, just intricate thing of deception"
1780.0,1783.2800000000002, here and anticipating that their opponents are going to try to put two people blockers
1783.2800000000002,1784.2800000000002, on this side of the map.
1784.2800000000002,1787.88," Well, other people are doing this and that and working out that there's an actual play"
1787.88,1793.6000000000001, that will just the map alone on these games are a barrier to entry.
1793.6000000000001,1795.0, I think that's a great point.
1795.0,1796.0, Sure.
1796.0,1801.8400000000001," And every day person, you know, I mean, because professional or even even like enthusiast"
1801.8400000000001,1806.16," people for any game, like they know the maps super super well."
1806.16,1810.96," And in a baseball diamond or like a football field or a soccer or basketball court, a really"
1810.96,1813.96, easy to diagram and communicate with.
1813.96,1815.8000000000002," Yeah, it's like dust too."
1815.8,1820.76," The closest thing would be like, oh, you know, a ski slope that has some difficult jumps"
1820.76,1824.56," and sometimes it jumps might not look that difficult on TV, but you still kind of get"
1824.56,1825.56, it.
1825.56,1826.56, Yeah.
1826.56,1827.56, What about paintball?
1827.56,1828.56, Maybe that's a good thing.
1828.56,1830.2, People have started televised in paintball.
1830.2,1832.1599999999999," You know, I'm sure maybe they would do the same."
1832.1599999999999,1833.6, They'd find some way to communicate with the people.
1833.6,1836.56," I was going to say, or even something like golf, I mean golf, all the courses are pretty"
1836.56,1839.9199999999998, technical and they have like a really specifically out that only golf is really going to
1839.9199999999998,1843.28, understand like the wind speed and all the things that are going in.
1843.28,1844.28, Right.
1844.28,1848.36," But the golf in the grass, golf really has that benefit of like having one of those"
1848.36,1851.6, human skills that is just like retardly amazing.
1851.6,1857.44, Like when you watch someone hit a golf ball perfectly and it goes like 10 times further
1857.44,1859.44, than you could ever hit a golf ball.
1859.44,1861.44," This is, and it's just like wow."
1861.44,1864.24, This is the like where I think I do differ a little bit.
1864.24,1868.24," Like you know, I mean, also when you're storing you bring up the idea that with video games,"
1868.24,1869.6399999999999, you're so used to playing in yourself.
1869.6399999999999,1873.24, It's hard to watch someone play it in the notion of doing that.
1873.24,1877.56," For me, it's like, I mean, there's a basketball court right across the street from a house."
1877.56,1879.88, And people are of all ages are playing there all the time.
1879.88,1882.8, And you think about how many people we know like in the building that are involved with
1882.8,1885.88," like, you know, weekends, soccer leagues and things like that."
1885.88,1888.48," And I think that, you know, people and golf too."
1888.48,1890.28, There's so many people that play golf.
1890.28,1894.72," And they know they're playing the same game, but they know they're never going to play it."
1894.72,1896.84," Like, you know, Arnold Palmer or something."
1896.84,1900.76," And the same way that we know we're not going to play this game like, you know, Rambo or"
1900.76,1903.04, any of the different people in this book.
1903.04,1904.44, And it's just not going to happen.
1904.44,1910.56," And the way that it's placing it, too, is it's like, it's like a child choir or something."
1910.56,1915.0," You know, like you hit your your expiration date like 22 years old and you retire."
1915.0,1916.0, Yeah.
1916.0,1921.72," You know, because how can you play Counter Strike for five hours a day, you know,"
1921.72,1922.84, for the rest of your life?
1922.84,1925.84," Like, I most people would start to feel a little bit like a loser."
1925.84,1926.84, Yeah.
1926.84,1930.76," So, about these coaches."
1930.76,1931.76, Yes.
1931.76,1939.6399999999999," So obviously, you know, one of, you know, they have bossy tactics and they, they, but what qualifies them"
1939.6399999999999,1942.6399999999999, or qualified them to be to coach?
1942.6399999999999,1943.6399999999999, That's true.
1943.6399999999999,1947.36, They want to get 10 year like Counter Strike player and like they just know that guy.
1947.36,1950.9599999999998, They were that guy to play for five hours a day for 10 years.
1950.9599999999998,1951.9599999999998, Yeah.
1952.04,1956.92," Well, qualified him was having the money to hire good players."
1956.92,1963.8," And he just has this personality of like, you know, a high school football coach that"
1963.8,1964.8, just fits.
1964.8,1967.24," I mean, he's not doing that much coaching."
1967.24,1968.24, He's a manager.
1968.24,1971.32, But the guy can still stop you on the back.
1971.32,1972.32, Yeah.
1972.32,1973.32, Yeah.
1973.32,1977.72," I mean, he trusts his, his like, his play callers and his players to do what they need to do."
1977.72,1980.48, He's mainly just pacing behind them at the events.
1980.48,1984.72, He pitted like notoriously is pacing back and forth behind their chairs like getting
1984.72,1990.92," red and like yelling whenever they lose or like, you know, shouting victoriously when"
1990.92,1991.92, they win.
1991.92,1993.3600000000001, He's the anomaly too.
1993.3600000000001,1994.3600000000001, Yeah.
1994.3600000000001,1996.96, He's another guy is like Levine for 3D doesn't do this.
1996.96,1999.08, He's might not even be there.
1999.08,2001.4," He's more like, I fund and manage this."
2001.4,2005.8," Whereas it's like, like, this sets like it is that he's paying the money."
2005.8,2007.44," He's like, he needs to live this."
2007.44,2008.44, Yeah.
2008.44,2009.44," It's like, carries."
2009.44,2012.44," Living is dream through like, there came a point when he realized like we're saying,"
2012.44,2013.64, sure I can hit a golf ball.
2013.64,2016.6000000000001," I just can't hit it as far as, you know, these people are with the precision of these"
2016.6000000000001,2017.6000000000001, people.
2017.6000000000001,2020.44," And just said, well, it's not going to keep me from liking this."
2020.44,2021.44, Yeah.
2021.44,2022.44, I'm getting this still.
2022.44,2025.04," We hear, but the differences that they'll tell you like, good job or like, you know,"
2025.04,2029.24," you guys are falling apart, but not like you, you know, Anthony, you need to pick this"
2029.24,2030.24, weapon.
2030.24,2033.8400000000001, And you need to like take banana or something rather than it's all flat.
2033.8400000000001,2036.2, It's really trying it out on a whiteboard.
2036.2,2037.2, Yeah.
2038.2,2041.52," His, I mean, part of the thing that that comes across is really interesting to me"
2041.52,2047.3600000000001," about Lake as a character in the book is that the way that Michael Cain paints him,"
2047.3600000000001,2049.7200000000003," he's, you know, hit midlife."
2049.7200000000003,2054.52," He has a couple of kids, an immortal age and law office."
2054.52,2058.28, And this is sort of a return to hanging out with the guy.
2058.28,2063.56," So certain degree, like revisiting a time in his youth when he was really competitive."
2063.64,2066.64," And, you know, hung out with the bros."
2066.64,2069.48," And, you know, did that."
2069.48,2071.68," And that's what drew him to it, maybe."
2071.68,2072.68, But yeah.
2072.68,2075.92, The whole thing I was thinking about the whole time when I was listening to you guys talk
2075.92,2081.88," about it was, like, football and all these things are like the same across the whole country."
2081.88,2084.7599999999998," And it's like in Korea, they've been successful with gaming because they have starcraft"
2084.7599999999998,2086.32, and it's like everybody plays starcraft.
2086.32,2090.44, But I'm trying to think of a game here in America that could be like that game that is like
2090.52,2094.12, the American video game that everyone plays.
2094.12,2095.12, You know what I mean?
2095.12,2097.7200000000003," Because there are so many games, there's like millions of little tournaments for Smash Bros."
2097.7200000000003,2098.7200000000003, We both games.
2098.7200000000003,2100.36," But yeah, that's like, what is that?"
2100.36,2101.7200000000003," Because like, what is that poker?"
2101.7200000000003,2107.44," I mean, this seems to most like poker, which I know plenty of people who are not professional"
2107.44,2112.84," poker players, but they compete and they get to the world's years of poker and they're"
2112.84,2117.2400000000002, like on one of the side tables or whatever they make a few rounds.
2117.2400000000002,2118.44, And that's great for them.
2118.52,2124.0," I mean, this seems really similar where you know, you might pick up whatever game."
2124.0,2127.28," I mean, that poker is just this classic game."
2127.28,2133.04," It's not changing, but for video games, it's going to, it's always going to change."
2133.04,2137.48," Yeah, well, I think the advantage of starcraft has just being a strategy game."
2137.48,2142.2000000000003," I think the action oriented, like, sort of athletic games, like shooters, like counter strike."
2142.2000000000003,2143.68, That's going to be a big problem for them.
2143.68,2148.16," I mean, already, like the counter strike competitive community, like, resists change."
2148.16,2151.7599999999998," They want to play, you know, the old 1.6 version."
2151.7599999999998,2155.7599999999998," And there's a new, new, where even though it looks, you know, pretty dated now."
2155.7599999999998,2156.7599999999998, It's yours.
2156.7599999999998,2157.7599999999998, Yeah.
2157.7599999999998,2161.8799999999997," Yeah, I mean, source version and people really dislike that version."
2161.8799999999997,2168.64, And so it's hard to play a game competitively and then expect it to follow the same
2168.64,2173.48, development cycle of games now where you expect everything to look nice and be visually
2173.48,2174.48, interesting.
2174.48,2176.72, So they're not moving off counter strike.
2176.72,2177.72, No.
2177.72,2178.72, So it's not.
2178.72,2181.64, I wouldn't be surprised if people are playing it in years for now.
2181.64,2186.04," Yeah, many people, they're saying that like we, everyone who plays counter strike in, we"
2186.04,2188.68, all know will be playing this game forever.
2188.68,2192.48," Like they, I mean, there's multiple, you know, like people in the games like this is it."
2192.48,2195.12," And then to the point where I wanted, you know, I'm glad you brought up."
2195.12,2198.04," It's the other theme of, you know, resistance to change."
2198.04,2201.48, But when you look at a game as being competitive and I can actually tie instrument impressions
2201.48,2205.8799999999997," of so-called reform, which I just reviewed for, for, for EGM."
2205.88,2210.52," But like when you have a game in your regarding and as a sport, you really have to, I mean,"
2210.52,2214.32," you don't want to radically revise it every year, like you're saying in the same way that"
2214.32,2219.8," the NBA is not going to introduce the three, the three point line and a change to the"
2219.8,2221.7200000000003, height of the rim in a single season.
2221.7200000000003,2226.92," I mean, those might be either of those could be acceptable, changes, you know, on the"
2226.92,2230.88," own over time, but you don't just go in and after a while, then it's not basketball, right?"
2230.88,2231.88, Yeah.
2231.88,2235.84," And so you get games like, this is well documented with Starcraft."
2235.84,2240.0," It's like, we can do new things, but it has to still be Starcraft."
2240.0,2244.8," And then reviewing fighting games is difficult not way too, because some people expect"
2244.8,2247.84," them, you know, they say, well, this is just the same game or something, you know, but like,"
2247.84,2252.88," if you really seriously played, it's funny because even changes to a character that you're"
2252.88,2255.7200000000003," used to are really, really dramatic to you."
2255.7200000000003,2259.2000000000003," And like if you, if you aren't a, you know, someone takes the game seriously, you're like,"
2259.2000000000003,2264.1200000000003," serious, that's, that's your idea of a change of an improvement in a sequel."
2264.12,2268.64," Yeah, it's, they give someone like six new moves and the new stance and change the inputs"
2268.64,2273.92," for the old moves, but like for me, I mean, I'm not a tournament player or anything,"
2273.92,2276.16," but it's like, I take it serious enough to want to be competitive."
2276.16,2279.96, Like when I play someone I expect to like have a good chance of winning.
2279.96,2284.2," And so like whenever I get a new one of these games, I'll spend like a week just in practice"
2284.2,2286.0, mode looking at all the characters and stuff.
2286.0,2292.64," And if like, my principal characters are changed differently, I don't feel like empowered anymore."
2292.64,2296.48, And that's like the worst feeling is to to go to a game that you think that you're competent
2296.48,2302.08," at and to feel like all of my learning is out the window, you know, all the muscle memories"
2302.08,2304.8399999999997, are going to serve me because all the inputs are different now.
2304.8399999999997,2308.24," But instead if there's like just a few new things to change the way I think of the game,"
2308.24,2312.52, but then I can apply every bit of learning and memorization and everything that I've already
2312.52,2316.72, inhabit that I have to excel at learning the new thing that works out well.
2316.72,2321.04," Yeah, the, I mean, the trouble with it is like there's always going to be the schism"
2321.04,2325.92," between people who play a game competitively and people who are just casual, not casual,"
2325.92,2329.68, but just gamers who want to pick up a new game and play it.
2329.68,2333.04, The people who just want to pick up a new game and play it are going to be the people
2333.04,2334.92, who are paying for the game.
2334.92,2338.72," You know, it's like that's going to be the bigger crowd every single time they're going"
2338.72,2342.36, to try to grab a bigger audience of people who would never play a soul caliber.
2342.36,2346.72," They're going to try to grab or any game, you know, any, any new game that comes out like"
2346.72,2351.0," a new counter strike even, you know, a meanwhile like it's going to be hard to get"
2351.04,2357.04," to sell the old hardcore crew on, on changing the version that they're playing."
2357.04,2359.44, They spin that money to begin with.
2359.44,2362.8," So yeah, something else is going to be like one of those eternal things."
2362.8,2366.68," It's a tough challenge, but I don't think, I mean, like, depending on how specific I think"
2366.68,2371.12, that people like myself in this case are really where most of the money is coming from
2371.12,2373.24, for a game like so caliber or something.
2373.24,2377.68," I mean, like there's the, there's someone who's like, whatever, it's a fighting game."
2377.68,2379.72, It's people that punch each other on a screen.
2379.72,2384.08," And then whatever comes out, you know, like a new mortal combat, you know, or something"
2384.08,2385.8799999999997," like that, and not to knock them out."
2385.8799999999997,2388.8799999999997," Matt, Matt, and actually like that's interesting example."
2388.8799999999997,2389.8799999999997, It's the same.
2389.8799999999997,2390.8799999999997, Yeah.
2390.8799999999997,2394.2," But I always wonder, like, is it the same people buying it?"
2394.2,2398.2," Because it's always such a top seller that you kind of wonder, well, these people can't"
2398.2,2400.3599999999997, all be the same people buying it year after year.
2400.3599999999997,2403.44," Because like, how could they, or why?"
2403.44,2406.8799999999997, I think a lot of the same people buy Matt and every year.
2406.88,2411.04," I mean, I think amazingly, I think a lot of the same people buy Matt and every year"
2411.04,2412.76, and a college game.
2412.76,2416.0," Like, I mean, I think they're, they double up on it even."
2416.0,2418.4, It's kind of amazing to me because I don't play.
2418.4,2421.6400000000003," I'm terrible at, at, at, at, well, that's what I was mean."
2421.6400000000003,2426.6800000000003," Because I have tried, like, I'd say every third year, maybe I'll try to get into"
2426.6800000000003,2428.7200000000003, Matt and I just never can.
2428.7200000000003,2433.2000000000003, But I sort of look back at the very old football games and I remember playing them
2433.2000000000003,2436.84," when I was super young and I'm like, oh, what if they put something like that?"
2436.84,2440.7200000000003," Like that out, then I would be into it, and especially now that I'm like a fan of football"
2440.7200000000003,2441.92, and that went to work fun.
2441.92,2444.08, But Matt and it's just not good.
2444.08,2445.08, Really inaccessible.
2445.08,2448.48," So, but they, they, they, they, they are doing this."
2448.48,2455.2000000000003," So, they're, they're basically making this line of, of, you know, with, mass, mass market."
2455.2000000000003,2459.6800000000003," Well, it's kind of weird to say that since Matt and his, so mass market as it is, casual,"
2459.6800000000003,2463.04, but even more casual version of football for we.
2463.04,2464.04, They have that new series.
2464.04,2465.04," I mean, I don't know."
2465.08,2470.68," I, I also played NFL Street and believe it or not, you know, that one was supposed to be"
2470.68,2471.68, more accessible.
2471.68,2475.56, And some ways that's more complicated in different ways and different along different
2475.56,2477.56, lines because it introduces like a ton of combos.
2477.56,2483.12," I mean, I'm talking about the one that was like on a, on a LED screen, you know, when"
2483.12,2486.92," you, you know, the lights and like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2486.92,2491.96," So, I'm talking about when I was in the second, I touched the hyphen."
2492.88,2494.88," I'm thinking, I'm thinking like, Tech Mobile."
2494.88,2496.76, That was like the last football game that I put.
2496.76,2501.0, I used to play tons of sports games and as a kid before they became about real
2501.0,2501.64, sports.
2501.64,2507.52, They used to just be games that were sort of a sports themed.
2507.52,2509.7200000000003," You know, Tech Mobile was not football."
2509.7200000000003,2513.12," It was a game that was sports themed, you know, it was its own game."
2513.12,2516.2, Now it's like now you played a football really rudimentary.
2516.2,2520.2," Yeah, it was a, it was like a really abstract version of what you would do in a,"
2520.2,2525.56," or like early hockey game, so some sort of, which were so, so very, very little"
2525.56,2527.4399999999996," different from a soccer game, right?"
2527.4399999999996,2530.3199999999997," You know, like those, those were, I could always play soccer in hockey games because"
2530.3199999999997,2532.12, they're the same game until now.
2532.12,2533.3199999999997," I mean, now they're very different."
2533.3199999999997,2535.7599999999998," But yeah, play to steal."
2535.7599999999998,2536.7599999999998," Yeah, I don't know."
2536.7599999999998,2537.7599999999998, I can't play.
2537.7599999999998,2538.7599999999998, I can't play.
2538.7599999999998,2539.7599999999998, I can't play.
2539.7599999999998,2540.7599999999998, I can't play.
2540.7599999999998,2541.7599999999998, I can't play.
2541.7599999999998,2542.7599999999998, I can't play.
2542.7599999999998,2543.7599999999998, I can't play.
2543.7599999999998,2544.7599999999998, I can't play.
2544.7599999999998,2545.7599999999998, I can't play.
2545.7599999999998,2546.7599999999998, I can't play.
2546.7599999999998,2547.7599999999998, I can't play.
2547.7599999999998,2548.7599999999998, I can't play.
2548.76,2550.44, Just called soccer or football.
2550.44,2551.44," Yeah, baseball."
2551.44,2552.8, Like those were pretty cool.
2552.8,2554.44, They're easy to get into.
2554.44,2558.32, Maybe maybe the next we sports will be like more in-depth stuff.
2558.32,2563.0800000000004, I could see like we sports football being the tech mobile of now.
2563.0800000000004,2567.6800000000003, If they took the baseball thing and made it into a baseball game that's more complicated
2567.6800000000003,2569.6400000000003, than baseball was for Nintendo.
2569.6400000000003,2572.84," There is such a game, just, you know, coming out."
2572.84,2573.84, Yeah.
2573.84,2575.1600000000003, It's like the official little league game.
2575.1600000000003,2576.5600000000004," As long as it's not, oh, little league."
2576.5600000000004,2577.5600000000004, That's cool.
2577.56,2580.44, Especially a little league game with like real little league teams from around the world.
2580.44,2582.84," I guess little league is like, is that little."
2582.84,2583.84, It's definitely a little injury.
2583.84,2586.72," But little league's like, you know, one of the most watch sports."
2586.72,2589.7999999999997, I can't wait till the little league game comes out.
2589.7999999999997,2592.7999999999997, I hope it has all the real rosters of all my favorite child.
2592.7999999999997,2593.7999999999997, Maybe.
2593.7999999999997,2600.12," Really, you were so good as a catcher."
2600.12,2602.68," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
2602.68,2603.68, It's a specificity.
2603.68,2604.68," We don't, yeah."
2604.68,2605.68, I'm encouraged.
2605.68,2606.68, Bobby.
2607.12,2608.12, Bobby.
2608.12,2609.12, Yeah.
2609.12,2611.12, Sports games.
2611.12,2613.12, Yeah.
2613.12,2615.12, And gaming as a sport.
2615.12,2616.12, And gaming as a sport.
2616.12,2617.12, Yeah.
2617.12,2618.12, I would like to see it.
2618.12,2622.3999999999996," I mean, I would watch, I would even pay online if I could see like games that I was into."
2622.3999999999996,2624.6," Like, I don't know about seeing it like an amass media form."
2624.6,2631.04," But if they offered to like, stream me matches live, if I paid like $2 to watch a tournament"
2631.04,2634.44," or something like that, I totally do it for like games I was into specifically."
2634.52,2637.64, Like a company here is one I'd pay to like watch streamed games.
2637.64,2638.64," Well, that's that."
2638.64,2640.64," Yeah, I'm going to see like a good guy."
2640.64,2641.64, Good.
2641.64,2642.64," No, I'm just saying."
2642.64,2643.64, I know what I want to comment is.
2643.64,2653.08, I want to see the team-based cooperative RPG competitive.
2653.08,2655.32, The ones are like tactic space.
2655.32,2658.76, So you're talking about people having our time dealing with the counter.
2658.76,2659.76, Yeah.
2659.76,2663.2000000000003, You have to sit there watching someone scroll through all the words.
2663.2799999999997,2664.7999999999997," No, no, no."
2664.7999999999997,2665.96, We can save the town.
2665.96,2666.96," Yeah, yeah, save the town."
2666.96,2667.96, Whatever.
2667.96,2672.24," Let's say we can, we can put in a code to skip all the things."
2672.24,2676.4399999999996," When you get to a certain room, there's like a really difficult combination of enemies."
2676.4399999999996,2682.7999999999997, And it takes creative tactics and a variety of different tactics can make you proceed.
2682.7999999999997,2683.7999999999997," Like, yeah."
2683.7999999999997,2686.4399999999996, I think that would be fun to watch different how different teams of each.
2686.4399999999996,2689.7999999999997," See, and that's what I'm thinking is that maybe if they just stop spending so much money"
2689.7999999999997,2691.64, on trying to make it like a big Hollywood event.
2691.96,2692.48, Yeah.
2692.48,2695.8799999999997," And they just did it all virtually, you know, and people tuned in virtually and all that."
2695.8799999999997,2697.96, They could become like a profitable thing.
2697.96,2699.72," Well, I mean, I think it's obvious."
2699.72,2701.2," It's like a transaction, really."
2702.2,2704.64," On jet, jet, anything like for televised."
2704.64,2706.08, It's just looking at me like.
2706.08,2711.68," No, it's no, it seems like it typically like male female skism, cultural, of course,"
2711.68,2712.72, that we're talking about here.
2712.72,2717.72," And that would be like, guys want to see, like, no, it's not like what you describe just like"
2717.7999999999997,2721.2," starts, you know, like, we want to see someone's got to get hurt."
2721.2,2722.9599999999996, Like someone has got to lose.
2722.9599999999996,2726.3599999999997," Yeah, I want to be co-operating and communicating."
2726.3599999999997,2727.9599999999996," Well, what a great team."
2727.9599999999996,2729.6, They really beat the computer.
2729.6,2733.8399999999997," Which exists in Counter Strike, but with the ultimate goal of trying to think over other"
2733.8399999999997,2738.6, people's energy that they see them to prove that they're inferior and cooperating.
2738.6,2739.6, And it's right.
2739.6,2740.6, I could see that.
2740.6,2745.48," I mean, Scott, I was just going to say, I could see what you're talking about"
2745.48,2746.8799999999997, being all over YouTube.
2746.96,2751.92," I mean, already, there's proof that people do want to watch video games and the amount of clips"
2751.92,2754.08, of of gaming that people do watch.
2754.08,2758.7200000000003," And I mean, I've watched tons of stuff, like tons of, like, team fortress moments that"
2758.7200000000003,2762.96," I've really enjoyed or even, like, halo videos can be really funny."
2762.96,2766.0," Those are all competitive, like you're saying, but I've even seen videos like"
2766.0,2770.6400000000003," Gen's Talking where you just see, like, a raid group in World Warcraft be like,"
2770.6400000000003,2773.32, this is how we did this dungeon from start to finish.
2773.32,2776.84," And they put a few two videos in people just watch to be like, oh, that's how"
2776.84,2778.0, they did that as a team.
2778.0,2779.6800000000003," Like, oh, they coordinated like that."
2779.6800000000003,2782.28," Like, and I mean, people, I could see that."
2782.28,2785.6000000000004," I could see that in, wow, like, as far as a huge ass raid."
2785.6000000000004,2786.6000000000004, Exactly.
2786.6000000000004,2789.8," What about instead of, like, the NBA model, you looked more toward, like,"
2789.8,2792.48," a bravo network and, you know, like, top chef or something."
2792.48,2795.32," And that's what I was thinking of the whole time, like, pastry chefs or something."
2795.32,2798.4," Like, I've watched a whole show about people that are just making cakes."
2798.4,2799.6000000000004, But I think that's what she's saying.
2799.6000000000004,2802.08," Like, I have that human drama in there about it where you're like,"
2802.08,2804.32, although I've got freaks out when he loses every time.
2804.32,2805.32, And you can shot.
2805.32,2806.88, That's what makes him funny to watch.
2806.88,2810.56, I think the reason that does bravo shows work is because they're the only reality TV
2810.56,2815.28, shows on television where you're watching someone who has any real fucking talent.
2815.28,2816.6000000000004, It's like such a relief.
2816.6000000000004,2819.84," When you're watching top chef, it's like, oh, finally, this person has a reason to be"
2819.84,2820.84, on television.
2820.84,2822.84," They have some talent, you know?"
2822.84,2823.84, Yeah.
2823.84,2825.32," Like, I think that might be a little bit hard to handle."
2825.32,2828.56," And they're a little bit, they're, because along with the talent, they're genuinely"
2828.56,2829.56, invested in.
2829.56,2830.56, It's their career.
2830.56,2832.84," And you don't think, you don't think gaming is a talent."
2832.84,2833.84," No, I have to say."
2833.84,2834.84, I feel it is.
2834.84,2836.84," Yeah, no, it is a talent."
2836.84,2840.84, Although it's not so caught up in that sense of like self and career.
2840.84,2842.84, At least not for most people.
2842.84,2844.44," Yeah, it would have to come after."
2844.44,2847.6800000000003," It's like, yeah, you'd have to, it would maybe feel like a game designer or something"
2847.6800000000003,2848.6800000000003, that could work.
2848.6800000000003,2852.8, But in some case where you already can't have a living doing doing it.
2852.8,2858.48," Well, and it's more about a certain intrinsic reflex, like skill."
2858.48,2860.1200000000003," You know, it's not something unissues."
2860.1200000000003,2863.1200000000003," They're like, oh, I'm really into RPGs."
2863.12,2866.68, And I'm going to study them and learn all about the various approaches.
2866.68,2870.12," You know, like, become a very skilled RPG designer."
2870.12,2871.12, It's absolutely right.
2871.12,2874.56," You know, I'd watch a speedrunners show."
2874.56,2875.56, I got it.
2875.56,2877.2799999999997," Yeah, that's a speedrunner."
2877.2799999999997,2878.2799999999997, Speedrunners are cool.
2878.2799999999997,2881.0, I fast forward through them even though they're fast.
2881.0,2884.0, But I enjoy them nonetheless.
2884.0,2888.16," It's like I've been thinking, the team gone in my head."
2888.16,2890.3599999999997," Okay, speedrunners."
2891.28,2893.28, Gather out.
2893.28,2894.8, It's make it work time.
2894.8,2895.8, Go.
2895.8,2900.32, So I've been working on my gym so day.
2900.32,2902.44, I'm still getting caught up on the warp pipe.
2902.44,2903.44," No, no."
2903.44,2908.6800000000003," For another retarded transition that we've mentioned, because we've mentioned gender differences,"
2908.6800000000003,2909.96, we've got to hear of the web.
2909.96,2911.6800000000003, That's all gender differences.
2911.6800000000003,2912.6800000000003, All right.
2912.6800000000003,2914.92, And this comes from deviant art forms.
2914.92,2915.92," Oh, no."
2915.92,2919.84, That's poster nuclear ice.
2919.84,2922.0, And he writes that female hardcore gamers.
2922.0,2924.7200000000003, He writes female hardcore gamers.
2924.7200000000003,2926.0, There are none.
2926.0,2928.0, Question mark.
2928.0,2930.52," So he says,"
2930.52,2938.36, I'm seeing this because I've been trying to find the hardcore female gamer for ages.
2938.36,2939.6, There are none.
2939.6,2941.48, I play games competitively.
2941.48,2942.64, Mostly fighting games.
2942.64,2948.44," But I go to smash brother melee tournament Street Fighter tournament, so caliber 213 tournaments."
2948.44,2953.8799999999997," I see females go and compete, but never make it to the top five, not even top 10."
2953.8799999999997,2955.2799999999997, Why is this?
2955.2799999999997,2960.08," I know there are no one female gamers, but nonetheless, I can tear them apart."
2960.08,2961.68, Like they are nothing.
2961.68,2963.7599999999998, And it is depressing.
2963.7599999999998,2965.2, I want a female girlfriend.
2965.2,2971.08, That can put up a fight.
2971.08,2972.08, That's girlfriend I had.
2972.08,2976.2, I told her I would dump her if she couldn't beat me at least once and smash brothers
2976.2,2977.2, melee.
2977.2,2980.24, She had two months to practice and so she did.
2980.24,2982.7999999999997," Constantly, she was okay."
2982.7999999999997,2986.4, But I still stocked her for like it was nothing.
2986.4,2988.0, So I dumped her.
2988.0,2993.6, No wonder why females can only play MMORPGs in the Sims.
2993.6,2998.72," Even though those games don't based on instinct, more on shortcut keys and quests."
2998.72,3002.6," If any of you think you know a female that is hardcore or awesome, it's fighting games"
3002.6,3005.04, tell me you have hardly seen any.
3005.04,3007.48," Other than that, get me a decent looking one."
3007.48,3008.48, Impossible.
3008.48,3009.48, Oh my god.
3009.48,3012.48, And so it ends.
3012.48,3015.2799999999997," Anthony, how about your girlfriend?"
3015.2799999999997,3019.3999999999996," Well, first off, I would never call my girlfriend."
3019.3999999999996,3022.0, But she said she was hardcore.
3022.0,3023.0, She is hardcore.
3023.0,3024.0, She has a fighting game?
3024.0,3025.3999999999996, She is a home to make her a female girlfriend.
3025.3999999999996,3027.2, She doesn't fit.
3027.2,3029.24, She doesn't play fighting games or shooters.
3029.24,3030.8399999999997, She plays RPGs and stuff like that.
3030.8399999999997,3032.7999999999997, But I would still call her hardcore.
3032.7999999999997,3035.64, Like the amount of games that she plays is like what?
3035.64,3036.64, Because she's not competitive.
3036.64,3040.04, She wants the exact same thing as a dude.
3040.04,3042.2, He should probably check for a male girlfriend.
3042.2,3043.2, Yeah.
3043.2,3045.4399999999996," Plus, this is just bullshit."
3045.4399999999996,3048.8399999999997, Like he dumped his girlfriend for losing its match brothers.
3048.8399999999997,3049.8399999999997, That's why he does this.
3049.8399999999997,3050.8399999999997, That's why he does this.
3050.8399999999997,3051.8399999999997, That's why he does this.
3051.8399999999997,3055.52," She's not about like a legitimate like, let's talk to her for a moment."
3055.52,3062.52," It's like, that guy, he can go with that comment or we can comment."
3062.52,3063.52, Yeah.
3063.52,3065.52, He's a good dude.
3065.52,3066.52," Yeah, I don't know."
3066.52,3071.68, I think it relationships in general would be them with the opposite sex or the same sex.
3071.68,3075.68, I seriously doubt that you really want to get super involved and being competitive at
3075.68,3076.68, something.
3076.68,3078.68," Like, yeah, it's very good to play."
3078.68,3084.56," Yeah, me and my wife played racket ball for quite a while in the mornings and it didn't"
3084.56,3085.56, end well.
3085.56,3092.04, We were really competitive about it and it just got to the point where it wasn't fun because
3092.04,3096.68, it was a source of pure venomous hatred.
3096.68,3097.68, Racket ball.
3097.68,3098.68, Yeah.
3098.68,3102.12, I got to be that way with Melissa and many golf even.
3102.12,3103.92, You guys are way competitive.
3103.92,3104.92, It's ridiculous.
3104.92,3106.92, I've mentioned this before on the Brodieu.
3106.92,3108.92, You guys are so serious.
3108.92,3109.92, But I got it.
3109.92,3110.92," Like, yeah."
3110.92,3111.92, But there's ways around it.
3111.92,3114.52," Like I always can tell like, okay, like that's."
3114.52,3116.52, She's like bummed out right now.
3116.52,3118.44," I was like, then that's when he turned the screw."
3118.44,3119.44, He was man.
3119.44,3122.2," Right, right when he's see weakness, he pounds."
3122.2,3123.2," Right, you suck."
3123.2,3124.2, And I don't really get mad.
3124.2,3125.2, I love it.
3125.2,3128.6," I love the fact that like, because I have that whole thing I told you most people"
3128.6,3129.6, you take the mini golf.
3129.6,3130.96, They don't take it seriously.
3130.96,3133.84, Like after three holes that get to the point where they're just like hitting it.
3133.84,3138.0," Yeah, just like talking to you and tapping the ball like 60 times just like walking"
3138.0,3139.0, it to the hole.
3139.0,3140.0, You don't.
3140.0,3142.84, I can't believe I'm going to kind of agree with that.
3142.88,3144.84," I'm going to be a little bit more hero, but um."
3144.84,3150.84, Like there is something about playing and being evenly matched.
3150.84,3156.84, Like it's not necessarily like I agree that true competition and nasty competition can
3156.84,3160.2400000000002, be can be very damaging to any friendship actually.
3160.2400000000002,3163.92," Not just relationships, but um."
3163.92,3170.32," But you know, I have faced this with with many of my friends on both sides like gamer"
3170.32,3176.92, friends who are more skilled than I am and non gamer friends I'm trying to get in to
3176.92,3177.92, gaming.
3177.92,3183.1600000000003, Like it's hard when you have to be the one who you know is kind of like gimping me
3183.1600000000003,3188.0800000000004, overall battle or like if you're the one who's kind of like holding back or something.
3188.0800000000004,3189.0800000000004, So poor guy.
3189.0800000000004,3192.36," Just you know, I mean he's got a great point."
3192.36,3193.36, I don't know.
3193.36,3195.36, I don't mean to say that totally.
3195.36,3198.36, I finally fell in my loom.
3198.36,3203.4," I don't even suggest that, but um."
3203.4,3205.92, He's really like he's got the demonious sex syndrome.
3205.92,3210.0, That's totally misogynist until someone actually agrees to go on a date with them.
3210.0,3211.6800000000003," And then he's like, my parents and that."
3211.6800000000003,3213.92, But the world's biggest worship for a women.
3213.92,3217.52, I don't think I can handle the rejection.
3217.52,3223.36, The first thing I got to know girl is how good are you at super smash brothers melee?
3223.36,3224.36," Dude, have you heard?"
3224.36,3225.36, Is this like to me?
3225.36,3227.36, You've heard the thing that's been going around.
3227.36,3228.36, No.
3228.36,3229.36, It's like the world's doucheous.
3229.36,3230.36, Like always.
3230.36,3231.36, Yeah.
3231.36,3233.36, You heard this?
3233.36,3234.36, It's incredible.
3234.36,3235.36, Yeah.
3235.36,3238.36, For what should we tell people so now they have no understanding what we're talking about.
3238.36,3239.36, It's a guy calling.
3239.36,3241.36, So I want to hear search like Dimitri the lover.
3241.36,3246.36, So basically it's a guy calling and leaving multiple messages on some girls answering
3246.36,3250.36, machine who he obviously just approached on the street.
3250.36,3252.36, And she gave him a refund of a red of pity or something.
3252.36,3253.36, Yeah.
3253.36,3259.36, And it's basically him telling her why he's going to give her a shot at him because he's
3259.36,3260.36, such a catch and he's so cool.
3260.36,3262.36," Girls approach me five, six times a day."
3262.36,3263.36, Yeah.
3263.36,3264.36, It is outrageous.
3264.36,3271.36," You know, I'm one of the only guys in this whole city that doesn't have a problem."
3271.36,3272.36, Yeah.
3272.36,3277.36," Or he'd be like, if you're mentally sound, give me a call back."
3277.36,3278.36, Yeah.
3278.36,3280.36, If you were abused as a child and this is why you're not calling back.
3280.36,3281.36, If you were molested.
3281.36,3286.36," If you have psychological issues, then don't call me back."
3286.36,3287.36, So fucked up.
3287.36,3292.36, But he reminded me of there's a season of the amazing race that I ended up watching and had this guy
3292.36,3293.36, on there called Jonathan.
3293.36,3295.36, And he had like a inventory.
3295.36,3296.36, Yeah.
3296.36,3301.36, And he reminds me of if you take Jonathan who up to that point was probably the most like
3301.36,3306.36," repugnant person I've ever seen at least when dealing with like, you know, the opposite sex."
3306.36,3311.36, And if you take him and just magnify him to like the most grotesque caricature imaginable.
3311.36,3312.36, It's real.
3312.36,3313.36, It's real.
3313.36,3314.36, Then you got to meet me three.
3314.36,3316.36," Well, start talking about the meetry."
3316.36,3319.36, So something YouTube that's worth checking out.
3319.36,3320.36, I did want to give you.
3320.36,3324.36, I did want to point people to post by venture Tainme.
3324.36,3328.36," And it's basically, I mean, never been to venture Tainme."
3328.36,3329.36, Yeah.
3329.36,3330.36, Like in Trillo.
3330.36,3331.36, That's a good thing.
3331.36,3332.36, I sent you some links.
3332.36,3333.36, I don't know if you're watching.
3333.36,3334.36, I know you did Anthony some of them.
3334.36,3335.36, They're really good.
3335.36,3340.36, And the tradition is now to go into like harass people in their in their ventrilovers.
3340.36,3343.36, And that's basically like a prank called pretty fairly boring.
3343.36,3345.36, There's hundreds and hundreds of these online.
3345.36,3351.36, But this guy takes it to another level and he does like clever things with it that make it awesome.
3351.36,3355.36," So, you know, one quick example that is worth checking out is he goes in."
3355.36,3360.36," And he starts playing like the air noises you get on your PC at various times for, I mean,"
3360.36,3363.36," there's you know, there's so many different types."
3364.36,3370.36," Yeah, he starts playing those and then the people are like, you know, they're rating and real the workcraft or something and they're freaking out."
3370.36,3372.36," They're like, dude, just all to have him fix it."
3372.36,3374.36," And the guy's like, it's my compared, it's freaking out."
3374.36,3379.36," And then we'll keep adding, adding, you know, noises from it and stuff."
3379.36,3387.36," And then when they eventually get to the point where they figure it out, he starts recording them and playing them back into the server at each other."
3387.36,3391.36, So then they're confused because they think they're talking to each other.
3391.36,3397.36, But they're he's just playing their own voices. And then after they figure out that that's the thing this is this is what makes them so successful.
3397.36,3401.36, My mind is he's always has a contingency for when shit gets played out.
3401.36,3406.36," So then he can always ramp it up. So then when they figure out, okay, he's recording us and playing us back."
3406.36,3412.36," He turns it to a song. So it might be like, if someone was like, hello, he turns it to like the rocky theme song, you know, like,"
3412.36,3415.36," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
3415.36,3418.36," He's like, he's like in this live and then the music is sync to it."
3418.36,3424.36," So we actually had it. But so in the one with the with the the air noise thing, he gets them laughing."
3424.36,3427.36, And they sound like beef and butt head. You think about it.
3427.36,3438.36, But you but you don't immediately until he loads up crazy train and starts using like their their their voices as like the equivalent of the focal thing on top of it.
3438.36,3442.36, And it was like a griefing like genius.
3442.36,3446.36, And it's kind of set of do you need to be able to do all that to get it right. Yeah.
3446.36,3454.36," And he's got a good sense of making fun of like, it seems like almost all the people who get to the kind of gamers that you don't want to believe exist."
3454.36,3458.36, The ones that actually say law and say it like that to each other like long.
3458.36,3460.36," So they're like, I'm gonna pun you do this guy's hacksawring."
3460.36,3462.36," I mean, imagine someone seriously."
3462.36,3464.36, We got hacksawers in here.
3464.36,3466.36," Well, and that rate was full of win."
3466.36,3470.36," Yeah, so the same people then immediately call every call him a fag."
3470.36,3472.36," Yeah, so without fail."
3472.36,3480.36," And so, but they also have this powerless thing where they say, all right, then I'm gonna hack this guy's computer and they say like, I got your credit card info."
3480.36,3482.36," And then then the friends, you know how it gets bad."
3482.36,3488.36," We're like one one guy in a group starts to get a little overboard and even his friends who are supposed to be on his side are like,"
3488.36,3491.36, You do really how did you get that?
3491.36,3494.36," He's like, oh, you know, right through his IP."
3494.36,3496.36, I'm looking at all stuff on his computer right now.
3496.36,3498.36, And then the guy will just turn that into a song.
3498.36,3504.36, He ends up turning that guy against his friends because they're all then laughing at what an idiot he sounds like.
3504.36,3508.36," See, he got his things, but now in the form of a song like they got NWA and vanilla ice."
3508.36,3509.36, Wow.
3509.36,3520.36," And then another one he uses the head on headache thing, which is great conceptually because it's like, let's take a commercial for a headache remedy and use it to induce headaches to people."
3520.36,3523.36, And it goes and he does crap with that.
3523.36,3526.36," And there's a Bob Rob, you know, Bob Rob video the whiz."
3526.36,3535.36," So he does want to restructure the woo for like a minute straight and then there's this girl and she's like, no, no stop."
3535.36,3540.36," And he's like, you know, play some club like, you know, the whizzle's go and then she's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
3540.36,3546.36," He does it again and it just goes and then it starts getting all like high and then low and then like,"
3547.36,3549.36," oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
3549.36,3551.36, Can I just get in and that's awesome?
3551.36,3553.36," Yeah, this stuff sounds amazing."
3553.36,3556.36," Yeah, if anyone that's listening knows that guy I'd love to."
3556.36,3560.36," Yeah, I like what them cause I gotta know what his like set up is."
3560.36,3564.36," Yeah, sounds crazy, just check it out after this."
3564.36,3567.36," It's a good way to like he already said it, but yeah."
3567.36,3570.36," Yeah. It's hard when I send the link to people and they first opened it and they're like,"
3570.36,3573.36," Oh, but I more of entry that right, mate."
3573.36,3574.6400000000003, is gonna be fine.
3574.6400000000003,3576.34, And it's gonna be like stick with it.
3576.34,3578.5, You'll see why it's not the same.
3578.5,3580.6200000000003, All right.
3580.6200000000003,3582.4, Soon we're out of time.
3582.4,3585.04, I didn't stick with the link you sent yesterday.

3591.3,3593.58, The Rocky Kid.
3593.58,3597.28," No, that's uh, that Rocky Kid."
3597.28,3598.7400000000002," I mean, he's got a ton of Nick names."
3598.7400000000002,3599.54, That was different.
3599.54,3600.7400000000002, That was just the kid that wrote to a block.
3600.7400000000002,3602.4," He'd specialized in sending people like videos,"
3602.4,3607.2000000000003, fat man is like so he's been a torius for the long time. He's the one he has like

3645.56,3647.56, Chuffing no
3647.56,3652.96, I don't even know if the British definition of chuff is which I think is kind of funny because the book I got the word chuff from
3653.2400000000002,3656.64, Was a word in dwarvish and it was written by Brits
3656.64,3661.4, It's like they probably knew that when they read it. I didn't even think about that. It's a bad. You can't even say it
3661.4,3664.4," Actually, I have no idea what it means. It's that bad"
3665.2799999999997,3669.6," It's not me and that's a bugger in time bugger in time. No, it's not"
