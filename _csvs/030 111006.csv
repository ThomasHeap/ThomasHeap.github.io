0.0,5.44, Hello and welcome to a very special edition of GFW Radio.
5.44,10.56," This is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of Games for Windows Magazine, and I'm here with"
10.56,16.16," Jeff Butler, the president of Citroes Games and Executive Producer of their very first game"
16.16,17.16, Vanguard.
17.16,18.16, Hi Jeff.
18.16,19.16, Hi Jeff.
19.16,20.16, How are you doing?
20.16,21.16, I'm doing great.
21.16,25.560000000000002," We have to do a Jeff one and Jeff two, so people know who we are when we're talking."
25.560000000000002,26.92, That is going to be confusing.
26.92,30.240000000000002," Okay, or we could be Butler and Green."
30.240000000000002,31.240000000000002, That works.
31.240000000000002,34.24," All right, which is kind of more manly anyway."
34.24,35.24, How are you?
35.24,36.24, I'm doing great.
36.24,40.32, I'm going to be scared with every question I ask you because if you could see in the studio
40.32,45.44," here if you're listening, Jeff is surrounded by PR handlers, like almost literally."
45.44,48.28," There's like three of them behind them, except they're all, that look like they're either"
48.28,50.040000000000006, in their cell phones or their side kicks.
50.040000000000006,51.92, So maybe they're not paying attention.
51.92,55.28, There's no chance of me getting out of line in this situation.
55.28,58.36," So all those tough questions I'm going to ask you, they're going to like be doing the"
58.36,61.160000000000004," you know, throat cutting thing when you're talking."
61.160000000000004,63.6," My back is turned to them, so I'll just ignore it."
63.6,64.6, Okay.
64.6,65.8, Well thank you for coming in.
65.8,67.2, My pleasure.
67.2,70.04, How are you doing and how is the game going?
70.04,71.84, The game is doing fantastic.
71.84,75.8," Everyone's been keeping busy, having a blast, putting the baited together."
75.8,80.64, It's just that that most exciting point time we're really able to sync our teeth into
80.64,84.32, our work because we're getting feedback from the players on a daily basis.
84.39999999999999,87.83999999999999, It's probably the most fun time in beta.
87.83999999999999,92.6," All the developers are able to jump in the game and they're off hours and on play tests,"
92.6,96.03999999999999," give one another feedback, build upon their work."
96.03999999999999,99.11999999999999, It's been fantastic in the last couple of months.
99.11999999999999,102.8," How many people are playing right now do you think, roughly, in the beta?"
102.8,105.19999999999999, I logged off earlier today.
105.19999999999999,108.0, They were about 940 people online.
108.0,109.0, That's pretty good.
109.0,113.08," So that's like a pretty big pool of different opinions to be getting, right?"
113.12,114.36," Yep, you know, in any given day."
114.36,116.67999999999999," Yep, people have made it to level 40 so far."
116.67999999999999,119.72, They're we're level locked in beta right now at 40.
119.72,120.52, That's insane.
120.52,122.36," Yeah, they've been hard to work."
122.36,122.88, Who would?
122.88,123.88," Yeah, okay."
123.88,124.88, I wouldn't do that personally.
124.88,127.67999999999999," I just feel like, okay, because you're going to wipe these characters."
127.67999999999999,128.68, Sorry.
128.68,133.8, We might transfer them over to a test server after launch.
133.8,134.32, Okay.
134.32,135.4, We've talked about it.
135.4,137.0, I think it would be a nice thing to do.
137.0,137.88, That would be nice.
137.88,139.56," But it would just be tests still, right?"
139.56,140.84, Exactly.
140.84,142.04, Not alive around.
142.04,143.04, Uh-huh.
143.12,148.12, So are you getting feedback now that's like a lot different than what you were expecting?
148.12,153.28," I mean, our things coming up that you, you couldn't possibly have imagined at the time."
153.28,155.68," You said, okay, let's let people play this game."
155.68,160.16," Not so far, actually, because we've been in the game with them kind of from day one."
160.16,168.0," So we're, we're judging our own work and then kind of basing our own, you know, our"
168.0,172.12, some of our own personal opinions on some of the feedback that we've generated internally
172.12,175.20000000000002, and whether or not it's been reflected in the player base.
175.20000000000002,178.96, A lot of times we're the ones who find the exploits or find the problems with the games
178.96,181.84, even before the players do.
181.84,185.44," So nothing as a striking goes, oh, damn, you know, we really didn't think of that."
185.44,186.44, Everything.
186.44,191.64000000000001," We've been rebalancing and making some changes to the game, adding in this or that tweaking"
191.64000000000001,192.64000000000001, the economy.
192.64000000000001,199.24, We've been talking about things like bind upon a quip and level limits fairly recently
199.32000000000002,205.16, to manage the economy a little bit more tightly than we level of a list of items say.
205.16,207.68," Item level limits, things of that nature."
207.68,212.56," So the game is evolving even through throughout the beta test, but it's kind of a measured"
212.56,213.56, process.
213.56,217.36," We're right there with the players, like I said, on a daily basis."
217.36,220.52, So nothing really surprising so far.
220.52,221.8," I guess that's good, right?"
221.8,225.16000000000003," Yeah, you're not going like, oh, God, what have we done?"
225.16000000000003,229.20000000000002," Yeah, we know we're going to have some emergent gameplay issues with some far more advanced"
229.83999999999997,232.64, encounter system and things like that.
232.64,237.32," And we have yet to see the effects of those things, but the beta will last a little while"
237.32,238.32, longer.
238.32,239.32, We have that time.
239.32,240.32, How much longer?
240.32,241.32, Hmm.
241.32,245.48," Of course, I don't know when this is broadcasting, so whatever you say might be meaningless."
245.48,248.32, We're planning a first quarter release next year.
248.32,249.32, Okay.
249.32,250.56, So a while longer.
250.56,252.83999999999997," Okay, that's not a long while."
252.83999999999997,258.28," Not too long, but long enough to figure out the high end game, the rating, all of those"
258.28,259.28, important issues.
259.28,262.84," I think if we hadn't done it before, we wouldn't even longer than that, but it's kind"
262.84,267.84," of, you know, we've got a lot of past experience to compare to, even the people who were"
267.84,272.76, new to the team were very avid players in the genre before they worked in the industry.
272.76,274.2, So they've got a lot of perspective.
274.2,279.55999999999995," Well, why don't we actually back up a little and tell people how long has this game"
279.55999999999995,284.44," now been in development and maybe even just tell us a little bit about how it, what the"
284.44,288.23999999999995," origin of this game was, how you and Brad decided to do this game."
288.32,291.92," Well, we've been in development for a little bit over four years by the time we launch a"
291.92,297.24, little bit more than four and a half years in all likelihood.
297.24,303.72, And the origin of the game actually started in the ever-quest days when we realized that
303.72,310.40000000000003, ever-quest sequel was not going to be able to have all of the fantasy game features that
310.40000000000003,315.12," we could imagine for an MMO, not even in the short term."
315.2,320.56," So, we've got a lot of technology, lead time, all of those things we're going to keep us from being able to make"
320.56,323.96," ever-quest sequel, everything we would have liked it to be."
323.96,334.96," We had some ideas for the diplomacy system, for instance, the non-conflict combat resolution,"
334.96,338.76, opening lore and quests and things of that nature.
338.76,341.68, A little bit more casual form of gameplay.
341.76,347.28000000000003," I think of it like an open door which we found in Wow, which of course, launched after we"
347.28000000000003,352.72," started planning Vanguard, kind of lowering the barrier to entry, making more of an every"
352.72,358.96000000000004," man's game, at least it began with so that there would be more critical mass."
358.96000000000004,362.2," More people would come to the game, you'd have more chance to make friends, things of that"
362.2,363.2, nature.
363.2,370.48, That was really the Genesis Vanguard wanting to make the spiritual successor of ever-quest
370.48,376.0," with a lot better technology and the ability to go anywhere that you could see in the world,"
376.0,378.0, things of that nature.
378.0,381.92," At the point, let's see if I don't know if I have on my history straight here, at the point"
381.92,389.76," that when we're you and Brad out of Sony, the first time around, was it ever-quest to even"
389.76,390.76, started yet?
390.76,391.76, Oh yes.
391.76,392.76, Okay.
392.76,394.36," For course, two had been in development for quite some time."
394.36,399.64000000000004," I think his matter-fac Brad was, Brad was closely involved in the production of ever-quest"
399.64,405.12," to, he may have been the executive producer, or in that general slot when he left, he was"
405.12,407.12," VP, creative director."
407.12,408.12, Okay.
408.12,413.32," Hacting as executive producer of EQ2, as I recall, had been in development for more than a year"
413.32,415.44, for more than two.
415.44,421.8," He left during the development of the 30 Q expansion, Shadows of Luckland, and I left"
421.8,423.91999999999996, right after Shadows of Luckland shipped.
423.91999999999996,424.91999999999996, Okay.
424.91999999999996,427.71999999999997," And hey, that was like the last expansion I played all the way through."
427.71999999999997,429.12," So, there you go."
429.16,430.28000000000003," And coincidence, there perhaps-"
430.28000000000003,435.84000000000003," Uh, so even though you're Sony handlers are behind you, I have to ask."
435.84000000000003,441.0," Since you're saying that you're thinking of Vanguard as a spiritual successor to ever-quest,"
441.0,446.68, does that mean to you that ever-quest to is not the spiritual successor to ever-quest one?
446.68,448.04, It was not for me.
448.04,451.56, I'm speaking specifically as a gamer.
451.56,456.0," It was not the spiritual successor of ever-quest for me, but then I don't believe necessarily"
456.0,458.16, that they intended it to be so.
458.16,463.88," Knowing that EQ was going to maintain its own subscriber base, I think it became their"
463.88,468.88," intent with EQ2 to ship more of an every-man's game, you know, something with a lower"
468.88,473.28," barrier to entry, but a lot of depth, something that built up to the depth."
473.28,478.52," You know, it is pretty interesting that like, that EA and Origin could never get it together"
478.52,481.76," on an ultimate online, too, despite, I don't know, how many attempts."
481.76,484.08," I mean, it was going to be our cover story at least once."
484.08,489.08," If we had some developers who worked on that project early on in Vanguard days, so I mean,"
489.08,494.71999999999997," at least, whatever you think about ever-quest, too, at least Sony was actually competent enough"
494.71999999999997,500.0," to get a 1 in a 2 out there running simultaneously, whereas you know, you can never figure"
500.0,501.0, it out.
501.0,502.0, Absolutely.
502.0,506.64," But maybe that is- like I still wonder about the cannibalism issue, you know."
506.64,510.08, It's a very real thing with MMOs.
510.15999999999997,514.4399999999999, That's one of those issues that kind of are going to plague our genre because it takes
514.4399999999999,520.72, so much time to plan MMO until we get to the point where they're so easy that you can manage
520.72,522.72, two MMOs in once.
522.72,525.36, They're pretty much always going to cannibalize one another.
525.36,526.36, Right.
526.36,531.12," To me, that's the very big issue and it's of course the one that everybody's dancing"
531.12,534.4," around, not with your game, but with every other game."
534.4,538.52," It's like, I mean, obviously, wow, it's the big elephant in the room."
538.52,542.6," But at some point, whenever that is, it's not going to be, I mean, maybe it will"
542.6,545.72, be Vanguard who knows what it's going to be.
545.72,547.64," But that's to me, the big question."
547.64,551.96," Right now, wow, is the big elephant in the room and how do you convince people who are"
551.96,558.04," already paying a monthly fee, which is essentially like another cable bill or whatever, $15"
558.04,564.64," a month, in addition to the hours are devoting to the questing and all that, to now do"
564.64,566.48, another one on top of that.
566.48,572.9200000000001," I mean, aren't you really having to ask them to quit, wow, for a Vanguard realistically?"
572.9200000000001,575.2," To some extent, quite possibly yes."
575.2,581.24, I think a lot of companies are going to be considering things like multiple entry points
581.24,589.0," to a game where, for instance, let's say a sci-fi version of ever quest, where you can transfer"
589.0,595.9200000000001," your character back and forth between the two worlds, where your persona built in one game"
595.92,601.88," may be applicable in some way to one of those companies, other games, where your progress"
601.88,603.5999999999999, gets carried over for you.
603.5999999999999,607.24," My guess is in the future, you're going to see stuff like that."
607.24,612.24, Because he just can't expect somebody to go back in and reinvest three years of time and
612.24,614.8, characters over and over again.
614.8,615.8, Right.
615.8,621.88," I mean, it's funny, you're seeing it even the minor backlash amongst the weeps with the"
621.88,626.96, learning crusade beta right now with people getting all pissed off that all of the hundreds
626.96,634.2," of hours they've spent getting the, you know, the upper tier gear is now rendered useless"
634.2,638.28," with the new stuff at the lowest level of blue and green, right?"
638.28,641.12, Absolutely the case.
641.12,644.28," And I was thinking about it the other day in terms of how would, how would Blizzard ever"
644.28,645.68, do wow to at this point?
645.68,647.48, They have the same problems everybody else.
647.48,649.64," Or world of Starcraft, right?"
649.72,655.04, So here's a different genre and we know that it would likely appeal to other players
655.04,658.48," than the current game, but then it would cannibalize as well."
658.48,663.6," My guess is that, you know, the cable subscription service is on everyone's lips in relation"
663.6,665.48, to massively multiplayer games.
665.48,670.4," The station players, the station pass is a huge thing."
670.4,671.4, Yeah.
671.4,674.24, You subscribe to one game for a certain price.
674.24,675.56, You get all games at the time.
675.56,676.56, Yeah.
676.56,677.56, That's very helpful.
677.56,682.1199999999999," As you can maintain your Star Wars Galaxy characters or what have you, and continue to participate"
682.1199999999999,689.0799999999999," in any Sony game, I think that is certainly the wave of the future for the modern MMO player."
689.0799999999999,692.04," And then adding at that point is just adding services, right?"
692.04,693.04, Right.
693.04,694.04, Yeah.
694.04,695.04, I think I agree with you.
695.04,699.2399999999999, That to me seems like the kind of hook that would that might work.
699.2399999999999,703.0," So many knows they're paying $15 a month, but they're getting this, this, and this,"
703.0,704.5999999999999, is a post to this one game.
704.5999999999999,705.5999999999999, Exactly.
705.6,710.0400000000001, In those games that require you to maintain your character or to go in like in galaxies
710.0400000000001,713.96," and maintain your guild house, put money in it so that it doesn't decay, I think that"
713.96,717.32," sort of service kind of, it's going to ring true."
717.32,723.72, It's certainly Vanguard will promote that sort of subscription model quite heavily.
723.72,727.8000000000001, Now I know that you're a wild player because it's come up quite a bit.
727.8000000000001,728.8000000000001," Oh, yes."
728.8000000000001,729.8000000000001, Before.
729.8000000000001,732.52," And then you have at least one level 60, not more."
732.56,734.8, I have more level 60s than I have fingers.
734.8,735.8, Okay.
735.8,738.4, I think that's kind of scary.
738.4,742.52," So that's a lot of hours you put it, not working on Vanguard."
742.52,745.24, That's why it's so late because it's called a wild playing.
745.24,749.68," You know, I actually think about it as working on Vanguard in one way because knowing your"
749.68,755.24," competition is really success in the industry, it's such a new industry, everything that"
755.24,760.68, one of our competitors does could literally change the direction of our entire industry
760.68,761.68, at this stage.
761.68,762.68, Yeah.
762.68,767.7199999999999," So I got to be in there, playing Jedi and galaxies, you know, playing EQ to all the"
767.7199999999999,771.52," games in beta, all the games in release that I can possibly get my hands on."
771.52,775.76," Well, I mean, it's an obvious smart thing to do for any developer."
775.76,781.4799999999999," I mean, on our side of the fence, whenever we see, say a real-time strategy game that"
781.4799999999999,786.4399999999999," is not, you know, designing with the conventional wisdom, like, you know, you could argue,"
786.4399999999999,789.16," well, they're not being original enough."
789.24,792.36, There are certain things that after a while are just the convention.
792.36,793.36, That's true.
793.36,797.0799999999999," If I can't, like, right, click on a unit, say, yeah, I'm taking what the hell are you"
797.0799999999999,798.0799999999999, thinking.
798.0799999999999,799.0799999999999, Yes.
799.0799999999999,802.4, And that's certainly starting to be true in massively multiplayer games.
802.4,807.68, Every major MMO kind of becomes a manual for the next one that comes out.
807.68,814.0799999999999," And if you deviate significantly from that in terms of player control or interface, you're"
814.0799999999999,817.88, just going to confuse a lot of people out of the gate.
817.88,821.6, So we hope to be pretty familiar to people who were playing the modern games today.
821.6,826.2," And did you have to give them more than just a feeling like, well, I've done this already."
826.2,828.8," Oh, absolutely."
828.8,834.12," From the very beginning, you know, one of the things that was a Vanguard tenant back in"
834.12,838.76," the day when we first started talking about making another fantasy MMO, people said to us,"
838.76,842.8, we really can't give us that first kiss experience.
842.8399999999999,849.1999999999999," We've already had our first kiss, PTP and U.O. or rating with our guild in EverQuest."
849.1999999999999,851.0799999999999, And I don't think it's ever going to feel the same.
851.0799999999999,853.52, You're never going to give us that back.
853.52,858.16, We sat down and made a long list of things that we thought could help our game recover
858.16,859.52, that feeling.
859.52,862.0799999999999," One of those things was, you know, amazing vistas."
862.0799999999999,868.24, We took Keith Parkinson's heart direction and tried to make a video game that was representative
868.32,873.6, of his most detailed oil paintings where you could see amazing sights off in the distance
873.6,878.08, that kind of pulled you into the game world and made you want to explore and level up.
878.08,882.08," And I think we were pretty successful in that when I run around in the game now, when I put my"
882.08,888.8," players hat on and I drop all the developer stuff and look at the game from a player's perspective,"
888.8,890.16, it does draw me in in that way.
890.16,891.76, And it does feel new.
891.76,896.16," You know, I even tried not to immerse myself in the lore of some of the dungeons and stuff like that."
896.16,899.04, So I can find it out through the game as a player.
899.04,901.4399999999999, And I think it'll resonate with people.
901.4399999999999,904.48, We did recapture that to at least some extent.
904.48,905.4399999999999, Mm-hmm.
905.4399999999999,910.0," Well, now the reason I asked you about, wow, in the first place was, you know, hearing you talk"
910.0,916.24," about this stuff and recapturing the first kiss in a way like you were a great mini gamers,"
917.12,919.52," first kiss as it were with this genre, right?"
919.52,921.52, I mean you and Bradley.
921.84,926.72," I mean there was obviously was ultimately online before, before everquest and there was"
926.72,930.0," Marie Jene 59, there were others, but everquest was really the first,"
930.8,935.28," really big one, the first one that that convinced a lot of people to do it."
935.28,937.12," Yeah, the first mainstream, I think."
937.12,938.0799999999999, I think so too.
938.0799999999999,940.64," Yeah, we put it in the hall theme a little while ago."
943.12,948.96," But now, you know, with with wow sort of dominating the scene like, do you,"
949.76,951.44, do you like present to their success at all?
951.44,952.72, Does it bug you at all?
952.72,953.52, Not at all.
953.52,956.96," Actually, you know, not only is a gamer, but a developer."
956.96,959.6, I love what they've been able to do.
959.6,962.96," I remember the days when we first started talking about doing Vanguard,"
962.96,965.2," that people said, you know, the markets tapped out."
965.9200000000001,971.6," You've already got, you've reached for every man's wallet and you've gotten the wallets that are there"
971.6,972.8000000000001, that are going to hand you money.
973.52,976.1600000000001, That's all the subscribers that ever will be.
976.1600000000001,976.5600000000001, Mm-hmm.
976.5600000000001,978.72," And we just looked at one another and were like, you know,"
978.8000000000001,984.24," wow, I know people who would love MMOs, my personal friends who have just not been able to break"
984.24,985.2, the barrier of entry.
985.2,985.6800000000001, Yeah.
985.6800000000001,988.64, They're not PC people or whatever the case may be.
988.64,990.88, We knew that there were a lot of lot more people out there.
990.88,992.64," And of course, wow, it's proven that."
992.64,995.84, And I think there are a lot more people than wow has exposed.
995.84,999.12, And waiting to you see the first massively multiplayer sports games.
999.12,999.6, Yeah.
999.6,1000.64," I mean, come on."
1000.64,1004.48, That's going to look at how popular fantasy football is.
1004.48,1010.5600000000001," Look at how popular EA sports games are on Xbox 360 live, so on and so forth."
1010.5600000000001,1015.9200000000001, Put all that stuff together in a massively multiplayer fantasy football where you're running through
1015.9200000000001,1020.88," the seasons where the actual players are represented can be traded, so on and so forth."
1020.88,1027.3600000000001," We can jump into the individual player as an MMO, as a sports MMO player and manipulate that individual"
1027.3600000000001,1030.4, player with his strengths and skills and weaknesses.
1030.4,1031.44, People will eat it up.
1031.44,1033.6, And it's just a matter of time before it shows up.
1033.84,1035.12, Especially if there were guns.
1035.12,1036.1599999999999," Oh, yes."
1037.12,1040.7199999999998," Like around the bases firing, you know, that'd be awesome."
1040.7199999999998,1046.3999999999999," It'll it'll be coming down the pike, massively multiplayer racing, etc."
1046.3999999999999,1047.1999999999998, Right.
1047.1999999999998,1048.1999999999998, Great.
1048.1999999999998,1049.1999999999998, Yeah.
1049.1999999999998,1051.52," Yeah, like Motor City Online was way ahead of its time."
1051.52,1052.52, Yep.
1052.52,1053.52, Tatar.
1053.52,1055.6799999999998," Auto assault, I don't understand exactly what happened there."
1055.6799999999998,1060.32," I mean, I shouldn't like talk about it like it's dead because it's still alive, so I'm sorry,"
1060.32,1061.6799999999998, hence he's soft.
1062.5600000000002,1064.4, I would have played it if it was a little more Mad Max.
1065.04,1066.96," Yeah, it's probably a little too EQ."
1066.96,1067.76, Yeah.
1067.76,1068.96, EQ and cars.
1068.96,1070.16, A little too generic for me.
1070.16,1074.48," Yeah, I think we are all hoping more for, you know, exactly like a Mad Max that you sort of."
1074.48,1075.1200000000001, Yeah.
1075.1200000000001,1075.8400000000001, Yeah.
1075.8400000000001,1081.3600000000001," Something I could, you know, something based in some known IP or something of that nature."
1081.3600000000001,1085.3600000000001," So do you believe, I mean, it's funny because somebody just asked me this question too, like,"
1085.3600000000001,1090.0800000000002," well, now that wow has this many million people, like, is that it now?"
1090.24,1095.76, And really I answered what you did because back then people said that about the few hundred
1095.76,1097.52," thousand playing Erika, right?"
1097.52,1098.1599999999999, Absolutely.
1098.1599999999999,1102.3999999999999," You actually think that that it's going to happen again that at some point will say, wow,"
1102.3999999999999,1107.04, how quaint it was that we thought that the MMO audience was tapped out at 4 million with
1107.04,1108.04, wow.
1108.04,1109.04, Absolutely.
1109.04,1110.04, I'm sure it'll happen again.
1110.04,1114.1599999999999," I mean, there's there's developing countries that are going to be avid MMO players."
1114.1599999999999,1117.76, And there's a whole lot of people that these games have yet to reach.
1117.76,1118.76, Mm-hmm.
1118.84,1120.36," So, okay."
1120.36,1125.16," So there's two things you're going to have to try to do here, which is convince those"
1125.16,1127.48," playing wow to try your game, right?"
1127.48,1128.2, Absolutely.
1128.2,1130.2, And develop the new audience.
1130.2,1130.92, Right.
1130.92,1134.6," I mean, you, because, see, it's to me, like you won't succeed if you don't, you got to get"
1134.6,1135.8799999999999," some of those wow people, right?"
1135.8799999999999,1138.6, Because they'll be the early adopters into your game.
1138.6,1139.4, Absolutely.
1139.4,1145.0," So, you know, all the people who played Erika West, Erika West too, some of the other"
1145.08,1151.8," early or core games, it's one of those things where we have to, as best we can within our genre,"
1151.8,1153.96, appeal to just about everyone.
1153.96,1159.88, And then start a pretty solid marketing campaign to get the word out to new people.
1159.88,1160.88, Mm-hmm.
1160.88,1163.76, And you feel confident about your ability to do that.
1163.76,1166.32," Well, the toughest part is going to be reaching the new people."
1166.32,1170.64, Because it's arguable as to where they're hiding and how to reach them.
1170.64,1171.64, Yeah.
1171.64,1174.92," I mean, at that point, you can follow some fairly interesting marketing"
1174.92,1181.4," concepts, you know, for instance, third edition D&D had an unusual marketing concept where"
1181.4,1186.16, they went primarily after the folks they called the Mavens.
1186.16,1190.4, A good example is the guy who you know in the office who's into stereos.
1190.4,1192.16, He knows everything about stereo equipment.
1192.16,1195.8400000000001," Anytime somebody wants to buy a new stereo, you have no choice but to go to that guy."
1195.8400000000001,1197.96, Because he knows what the hottest product is on the market.
1197.96,1202.24," He knows what you need to buy, what speakers you need, so on and so forth."
1202.24,1205.52, You appeal to those Mavens and you let them talk about your game.
1205.52,1210.8," So you find those guys wherever they're hiding for whatever genre, whether it's magic"
1210.8,1214.64," the gathering, a lot of people who play magic, play MMOs, you didn't know where to"
1214.64,1215.64, faireth them out.
1215.64,1218.44," These guys must be on your forums already, I would think."
1218.44,1223.24," A lot of them are, but you know, going to their forums, you know, find them, you know,"
1223.24,1227.32," magic the gathering online form, go to their forums and talk to them about the game"
1227.32,1228.32, that they're missing.
1228.32,1229.68, They're like playing online games.
1229.68,1235.2, There's a card game inside Vanguard saga of heroes that actually matters to you as an
1235.2,1241.68," adventure or crafter or harvester, socializing player zone and so forth."
1241.68,1246.76, That's going to be the tough part about faireting out the new person.
1246.76,1248.76, What magazines do they subscribe to?
1248.76,1253.4, What are they doing today other than playing wow or another one of the or Eve?
1253.4,1257.16," You know, whatever massively multiplayer game out there that would appeal to them."
1257.16,1261.0800000000002, How do you find them in reach them and draw their attention to your product?
1261.0800000000002,1262.0800000000002, Right.
1262.0800000000002,1263.68," Actually, yeah, you mentioned Eve and that's true."
1263.68,1267.68," That's a good example of a game that somehow, you know, it's doing its thing."
1267.68,1268.68, It's doing well on its own.
1268.68,1269.68, It's viral.
1269.68,1270.68, Yeah.
1270.68,1271.88," I mean, they started a game."
1271.88,1274.0800000000002, They had a fantastic premise.
1274.0800000000002,1279.1200000000001," All players in one world, strong PvP, you know, all or nothing, your ship has gone."
1279.1200000000001,1280.1200000000001, It's gone forever.
1280.1200000000001,1281.68, It takes a long time to build it.
1281.68,1289.04, So people who have hardcore gameplay styles find a lot of value for their time invested
1289.04,1290.3200000000002, in a game like that.
1290.3200000000002,1292.64," And from that point on, it's viral marketing."
1292.64,1297.8," The guy who you knew, you PvP with and you, who always knew the best exploits, always"
1297.8,1299.48, knew how to kill the other guy.
1299.48,1301.4, That guy may be playing Eve right now.
1301.4,1305.72," You still got him on your, you know, your trillion message list and you ask him what he's"
1305.72,1311.04," doing or he just post, you know, his Eve icon, same what he's doing and then you know,"
1311.04,1315.68, there's got to be a game that a gamer who's like-minded is enjoying today.
1315.68,1316.68, Right.
1316.68,1317.68, So you got him by a copy.
1317.68,1318.68, Right.
1318.68,1326.04, So the reputation of Vanguard so far or a lot of it has been about its hard-cornness.
1326.04,1327.04, Yes.
1327.04,1330.8799999999999," And when I was at the event that you guys held a few weeks ago, you seem to be going"
1330.8799999999999,1335.68, to some extra pains to sort of demystify that.
1335.68,1338.44, Absolutely the case.
1338.44,1343.8400000000001," You know, back in the, in the infancy of Vanguard, before we were even talking about"
1343.8400000000001,1345.04," Vanguard, so I go of heroes."
1345.04,1351.3200000000002," We were just talking about a spiritual successor to EverQuest, keeping, keeping a subscription"
1351.3200000000002,1358.48," model game, flowing and making sure that customers feel welcome."
1358.48,1361.0800000000002, Welcome to join the game.
1361.0800000000002,1366.8400000000001, Welcome to rejoin the game after they've gone for a tour of duty overseas or their
1366.84,1372.28," job is taking them away to, you know, an offshore oil drilling rig for three months."
1372.28,1378.56," Whatever the case may be, in some of the more modern MMOs, that those types of events are"
1378.56,1379.56, closed door.
1379.56,1384.76," You've lost contact with your guild, you've lost knowledge of the progression curve,"
1384.76,1387.6399999999999," an expansion has come out, now you feel kind of lost."
1387.6399999999999,1391.84, You don't know anything about the outland and you don't have a flying mount for instance.
1391.84,1395.52, So it makes it very difficult to think about coming back to the game and rejoining.
1395.52,1401.8799999999999, There's obviously a huge learning curve designing a game that welcomes a player who has
1401.8799999999999,1407.72," 20 minutes to play, who hasn't played in one day or hasn't played in 20 days or 200 days,"
1407.72,1409.36, is something that's pretty key.
1409.36,1414.04," Every time you launch an expansion or you do live content, it's got to reinvest the players"
1414.04,1420.24, that you have and the players that you would like to return to your subscription game.
1420.24,1424.16, So Vanguard was literally envisioned from that standpoint.
1424.16,1429.52, And while I would call it a more challenging game than while it's also intended to be more
1429.52,1433.24," rewarding for that challenge, it's kind of those two things go hand in hand."
1433.24,1436.0800000000002, Think of a really good dungeon master.
1436.0800000000002,1440.5600000000002," If you ever played Dungeons & Dragons in college or something of that nature, when you're"
1440.5600000000002,1446.2," investing an evening's time expecting some entertainment, you like to be challenged, not"
1446.2,1447.2, necessarily frustrated.
1447.2,1449.72, Be on a certain point.
1449.72,1454.0800000000002, Certainly not necessarily frustrated as games like UO might have left you after
1454.08,1458.28, you get PK and lost all your stuff or EQ might have left you after you spent 15 hours
1458.28,1463.6399999999999," trying to camp a rare spawn, only to have some level 50 wizard show up and gank it and"
1463.6399999999999,1464.8799999999999, then log back off.
1464.8799999999999,1466.28, How about leveling down?
1466.28,1468.28, That was always my favorite.
1468.28,1469.28," I know, yes."
1469.28,1473.0, Leaving my gaming session at the end of the night lower level than I started.
1473.0,1478.8799999999999," Yeah, that sort of thing is it's very unlikely to expect the modern gamer to put up with"
1478.8799999999999,1479.8799999999999, those things.
1479.88,1485.96, So keeping that barrier to entry and re-entry low and making the game feel like a welcome
1485.96,1490.1200000000001, place was huge on our list from day one.
1490.1200000000001,1493.1200000000001, You can solo to 50 in Vanguard.
1493.1200000000001,1498.16," You're in very much encouraged to group, but even more than just encouraging you to group."
1498.16,1502.2800000000002, We're encouraging you to make friends because it's not the group that keeps you coming
1502.2800000000002,1503.88, back after six months.
1503.88,1504.88, Hit your friends.
1504.88,1505.88, Right.
1505.88,1506.88, We've heard it time and time again.
1506.88,1508.48, And we feel the same way ourselves.
1508.56,1510.68, I wouldn't be logging on a plan while right now.
1510.68,1515.0, If my guild didn't need me as a tank or need me to fill in with any one of my other
1515.0,1519.0, alt characters where necessary.
1519.0,1521.4, Any good guild needs competent players.
1521.4,1527.68," They need the social glue of people who are friendly and who enjoy these games, who"
1527.68,1532.48," keep people coming on, coming back on and playing month after month, year after year."
1532.48,1535.32, I can't do without it.
1535.32,1542.32," At the demo, I was really impressed by the low level mounts that was a really clever"
1542.32,1543.32, idea.
1543.32,1549.24, We made a big world in the very early days of Vanguard when we were running around our
1549.24,1554.0," test maps, trying to decide if we were making them large enough, if they felt real, you"
1554.0,1555.24, have a castle in the distance.
1555.24,1556.56, Is it far enough away?
1556.56,1558.76, Does it give you that sense of wonderment?
1558.76,1563.3999999999999, We realized pretty early on that mounts were going to have to be a player entitlement
1563.4,1566.1200000000001, starting at earlier levels.
1566.1200000000001,1573.76, It seems like it's not just trying to one up while we have them at level 10 instead
1573.76,1580.44, of 40 because you actually did this kind of crappy horse.
1580.44,1582.44, Enough to get to Nive.
1582.44,1583.44, It's a nag.
1583.44,1585.44, You still got to earn the better mounts.
1585.44,1588.8400000000001, That becomes part of your progression.
1588.9199999999998,1593.8," Getting up your character, leveling up, getting better mounts, faster mounts, crafting"
1593.8,1597.3999999999999, better horseshoes and armarmor and all that sort of good stuff.
1597.3999999999999,1599.76, You still can't fight though on the horses.
1599.76,1605.3999999999999," You won't be able to fight on horseback at launch, but after launch, mounted combat's"
1605.3999999999999,1607.76, definitely on the list.
1607.76,1609.28," Let's see, they're going to be great."
1609.28,1611.24, Or it's going to suck.
1611.24,1613.48, That's my professional opinion.
1613.48,1618.32," Well, we envisioned Mountain Combat really early on in development."
1618.32,1623.9199999999998," So a lot of the systems that we built, for instance, the player skills, the actual"
1623.9199999999998,1630.84," player classes and their jobs kind of delvetail very neatly into Mountain Combat, expect"
1630.84,1638.9199999999998," kind of a rock versus paper versus scissors, sort of approach where the mounted player is"
1638.9199999999998,1642.56, poor at spell casting and poor at archery for instance.
1642.56,1648.6399999999999," But able to deliver a devastating charge, the infantry player who has things like a"
1648.6399999999999,1654.6399999999999, pole arm or spear has great defense against charging mountain characters.
1654.6399999999999,1658.8799999999999," On a mount, you can easily outflank another player and deal massive damage."
1658.8799999999999,1663.32," But then again, you're easy to shoot at as well because your movement is very predictable."
1663.32,1666.8," So your vulnerable to arrows, your vulnerable to spells."
1666.8,1670.8799999999999," If you get knocked off, you can be seriously hurt, stunned."
1670.88,1673.2800000000002, All sorts of interesting things like that.
1673.2800000000002,1679.92," You'll see large PvP maillays, I expect with certain people mounted for one of these"
1679.92,1682.6000000000001, or another and certain people dismounted.
1682.6000000000001,1684.44, Certain people using missile weapons.
1684.44,1688.2800000000002," Well, people would be able to fire arrows, you think, from their horses, like horse archers"
1688.2800000000002,1689.7600000000002, or most definitely.
1689.7600000000002,1694.0400000000002," Although it'll be less effective to utilize our tree from the back of a mountain, it will"
1694.0400000000002,1695.6000000000001, be from the ground.
1695.6000000000001,1697.6000000000001," Short of range, less accuracy."
1697.6000000000001,1699.6000000000001, Very rock paper scissors.
1699.6399999999999,1701.6, Can I carry out a kill the animals?
1701.6,1706.6," No, I'm pretty sure your mount won't actually participate in combat with you as a pet."
1706.6,1708.04," Okay, that'd be kind of sad."
1708.04,1709.84," Yeah, I don't think you're going to be able to do that."
1709.84,1713.32, Although the mount may likely have stamina and things like that.
1713.32,1714.32, Right.
1714.32,1718.6799999999998, Executing your special abilities and sprinting using some of the flanking attacks will probably
1718.6799999999998,1719.6799999999998, draw a mount stamina.
1719.6799999999998,1725.28," And of course, all that breaks into flying mounted combat later on where stamina and the"
1725.28,1727.28, ability to stay a loft matter.
1727.6399999999999,1732.08," Yeah, see that when I picture whether I'm going to play or not or what I want to do"
1732.08,1733.6," in the game, that's the thing."
1733.6,1739.2," I picture like being in a flying mount, you know, raining terror down on absolutely"
1739.2,1740.2, lowbies.
1740.2,1741.2, Death from above.
1741.2,1742.2, Happy.
1742.2,1745.8799999999999," And flying mounted combat would work the same way, pretty much rock paper scissors,"
1745.8799999999999,1749.04, where you're fantastic diving from above.
1749.04,1752.92," But when you're flapping along in a straight line, anyone can hit you with an arrow"
1752.92,1754.68, because the name wouldn't be.
1754.68,1756.72, And that seems like it'd be equally fun.
1756.72,1757.72," Yeah, see sniping."
1757.72,1759.44, That one's flying above you.
1759.44,1760.44, Absolutely.
1760.44,1762.88, Would they actually fall off their mount if you thought about that?
1762.88,1766.88," Oh, yes, we absolutely have thought about that."
1766.88,1770.04," As a matter of fact, I died twice in demos earlier this morning falling off my"
1770.04,1771.04, mount.
1771.04,1772.04, Yep.
1772.04,1773.04, Okay.
1773.04,1774.04, See you right there.
1774.04,1775.04, I'm probably going to play.
1775.04,1776.04," Oh, yeah."
1776.04,1777.04, So it's detail that.
1777.04,1782.48, The ability to like shoot somebody off their mount will spell as they fly by.
1782.48,1783.48, Very cool.
1783.48,1784.48," Yeah, that sounds great."
1784.48,1785.48, Yeah.
1785.56,1789.96, We were we've been talking a lot about playercrafted ships.
1789.96,1793.72," And of course, the first question there is how about ship to ship combat."
1793.72,1800.0," Again, we won't have ship to ship combat at launch, but looking post launch, the ability"
1800.0,1805.64, to mount a cannon on your ship and go cruising past the new beard and blow up a few newbies
1805.64,1806.64, on the PVP server.
1806.64,1811.48, I think you mentioned it on the demo day that like if your ship was destroyed and
1811.56,1814.24," fired, it's not it's obviously not gone forever, right?"
1814.24,1816.52, But it will require a repair or something.
1816.52,1820.84," Something of that nature kind of like the corpse of your player, maybe you can, you know,"
1820.84,1827.28, pay some gold or devote some crafting skill or resources to putting it back together.
1827.28,1830.4, And it would appear in the world like a corpse and kind of like flots of music.
1830.4,1831.4, Click on your flots.
1831.4,1832.4, Right.
1832.4,1833.4, Rebuild it.
1833.4,1834.4, Right.
1834.4,1835.4, Okay.
1835.4,1837.1200000000001, So speaking of corpses and then I don't know how much time we have.
1837.1200000000001,1838.4, How are we doing?
1838.4,1839.4, 30 minutes.
1839.4,1840.4, Okay.
1841.3200000000002,1846.4," So let's talk about death in Vanguard because there's been some, you know, I don't spend"
1846.4,1850.4, a whole lot of time trolling the message boards or your message boards because I have
1850.4,1851.68, to troll my own.
1851.68,1858.3200000000002, But I do know that some people have been have been bitching about your guys death mechanism
1858.3200000000002,1862.2, or maybe not understanding it or maybe understanding it and not liking it.
1862.2,1863.2, Yeah.
1863.2,1866.52, So what is your take on death in Vanguard?
1866.52,1870.2800000000002," Well, you know, honesty, death is one of those."
1870.28,1877.28, The elements of frustration that exist in these games for one reason or another in general
1877.28,1880.8799999999999," to make you appreciate the fact that you've achieved something, some sort of goal."
1880.8799999999999,1886.16, You've avoided death and whatever sting they particular massively multiplayer game attaches
1886.16,1887.8799999999999, to it.
1887.8799999999999,1894.52, It's almost an arguable that the death mechanic is factored into subscription numbers.
1894.52,1900.4," So when you're looking at a death mechanic depending on how much of a penalty there is,"
1900.4,1905.8," you're effectively, if you decide to be very hardcore, limiting your potential number"
1905.8,1907.36, of subscribers.
1907.36,1909.52, We want to make a challenging game.
1909.52,1916.28, One that appeals to the achiever that remains an open door to the average person.
1916.28,1923.44, So picking the appropriate death mechanic to reward players who manage to achieve is
1923.48,1925.76, one of our primary goals.
1925.76,1931.6000000000001, I think that we're going to end up with a death mechanic that is kind of dynamic based
1931.6000000000001,1932.6000000000001, on mob difficulty.
1932.6000000000001,1939.6000000000001," So the harder the mob gets, the more money or the more experience you may lose when you"
1939.6000000000001,1943.6000000000001, die and want to recover your corpse.
1943.6000000000001,1953.04, Whether or not we have a corpse recovery mechanic at launch remains under debate right now
1953.04,1957.04," but the way the system is set up, you only have to recover your corpse if you're killed"
1957.04,1963.6399999999999," by the most powerful mobs in the game, like literally the most powerful guys in the game."
1963.6399999999999,1971.24," So in the dynamic threat threat system, we have different dots that denote mob difficulty"
1971.24,1973.48, and a six dot mob is the most powerful.
1973.48,1976.8799999999999," And when one of those kills you, you have to run back and get your corpse."
1976.8799999999999,1979.44, But that may end up being part of an alternate rule set.
1979.44,1981.24, We're not absolutely sure right now.
1981.32,1985.64," Okay, so what happens right now if I'm level six and I get killed by a goat."
1985.64,1989.64," If you get killed by the goat, you can run over to the altar where you respawn and just"
1989.64,1992.04, pull your corpse back to you for about eight copper.
1992.04,1993.04, Okay.
1993.04,1994.04, Which is really cheap.
1994.04,1995.04, So it's a cheap money hit.
1995.04,1999.96," Yeah, it's a little money hit right now and if you go to recover your corpse, if you basically"
1999.96,2003.84," make the run back where you died, you get a little bit of the experience you lost back."
2003.84,2004.84, Okay.
2004.84,2007.1200000000001," So in general, I should all of it though."
2007.1200000000001,2008.28, Not all of it.
2008.28,2011.3999999999999, But it's not more than just a couple of level appropriate kills.
2011.3999999999999,2014.04," I mean, it's it's a sting."
2014.04,2018.84," I can tell you doing some stupid stuff fairly, fairly recently, down by the riverbank,"
2018.84,2021.32, trying to kill some crocodiles that were way over my level.
2021.32,2026.16, I could die like four times and didn't end up progressing for about my hours worth of time
2026.16,2027.16, invested.
2027.16,2030.0, And that's the last time that I'm going to do that.
2030.0,2031.8," But you didn't, you can't level down right?"
2031.8,2032.8, Nope.
2032.8,2033.8, Can't lose a lot of.
2033.8,2035.28," Yeah, you don't lose your skills."
2035.28,2036.8, You don't lose your level.
2036.8,2042.32," In general, you don't, you don't really suffer from loss at all in the game."
2042.32,2043.68, So you don't lose your items.
2043.68,2047.84, They don't get to A or anything like that because it's just one of those things.
2047.84,2052.4," Nowadays, you invest time in a massively multiplayer game and you want to walk away with"
2052.4,2055.12, what you earned for your time invested.
2055.12,2060.04," So if I have just recently leveled up and I get killed five times in a row, does I just"
2060.04,2061.72," stop, stop?"
2061.72,2064.0, There's a point in which I just don't lose anymore XP.
2064.0,2065.0, That's correct.
2065.08,2067.04, So I've just hit the rock bottom of level.
2067.04,2072.04," Yeah, I think in some cases, you might then start a current debt."
2072.04,2076.2," So you can, you basically get into a hole, but you can dig yourself out and you don't"
2076.2,2078.28," lose your, your place in line."
2078.28,2080.64, So probably don't play stupid as the advice.
2080.64,2085.92," Yeah, we definitely aren't going to reward somebody who plays stupid or just takes their"
2085.92,2086.92, gear off.
2086.92,2091.04," For instance, it goes running across the world trying to see how many corpses they can create."
2091.04,2093.76, So they can create lag for other players or something of that nature.
2093.76,2094.96, Who would ever do anything like that?
2094.96,2099.32," Yeah, so it's actually, I don't think it's ever happened any again."
2099.32,2101.68," Hey, can there be a trains in Vanguard?"
2101.68,2107.08," There certainly can be trains, but there are a little bit friendlier than other trains."
2107.08,2112.08," You know, in a manner similar to while those trains don't automatically aggro on everyone"
2112.08,2113.08, they pass by.
2113.08,2114.08, Yeah.
2114.08,2116.28," Unless there's a bug, there have been a few bugs in beta."
2116.28,2120.44, I saw a guy run by me a couple days ago with a pride of lions on his heels.
2120.44,2123.16," And I was like, wow, that guy's going to die and sure enough he did."
2123.16,2127.2799999999997," Unfortunately, ran by me a little too closely and then the pride of lions was on my"
2127.2799999999997,2128.2799999999997, heels.
2128.2799999999997,2129.2799999999997, Yeah.
2129.2799999999997,2130.2799999999997, And I had to run.
2130.2799999999997,2132.52, I think I ran about two kilometers before they leashed back before they belonged.
2132.52,2137.08," I thought that was definitely one of the better, wow, innovations."
2137.08,2139.08, Not innovation is my like a refinement.
2139.08,2143.2," Yes, preventing the the grief ability of training."
2143.2,2147.16," You know, if the mob leashes back, it evades the whole way back."
2147.16,2149.2799999999997, It doesn't gain aggro and anyone else.
2149.36,2154.1600000000003, You can't catch it in an AOE and aggro in or anything like that and will end up doing
2154.1600000000003,2159.0800000000004," something that is that is for Vanguard purposes, functionally identical to that."
2159.0800000000004,2163.84," And got, remember the shame that you would have yourself if you caused a train like a request."
2163.84,2164.84, Absolutely.
2164.84,2167.6400000000003, I would log off because I would just feel so absolute bad in a few moments.
2167.6400000000003,2170.88," Here's how to ask who trains, you know, you have to like go away."
2170.88,2171.88, I'm sorry.
2171.88,2173.6400000000003, And it could be pretty bad.
2173.6400000000003,2177.0400000000004, You could just wipe out an entire circle of people if you weren't careful.
2177.0400000000004,2178.0400000000004, Yeah.
2178.04,2179.04, I got too much shit.
2179.04,2180.48, I would just like train them again.
2180.48,2181.48, It's okay.
2181.48,2182.48, Fine.
2182.48,2183.48, I'm a jerk.
2183.48,2186.68, And then customer service would we get the petitions?
2186.68,2187.96, Yeah.
2187.96,2193.36," All of those things, it's just one of those issues where that whole scenario, the customer"
2193.36,2198.12," service getting the petition, designing a system where your CS people don't ever have to"
2198.12,2202.48, get involved allows you to take the money that they would have had to be paid and put
2202.48,2204.72, it back into developing the game.
2204.72,2210.3199999999997, So building a game that's generally free of the need for customer service is the smartest
2210.3199999999997,2211.3199999999997, thing to do.
2211.3199999999997,2212.3199999999997, Yeah.
2212.3199999999997,2215.6," That's, I mean, to me, that seems like a huge advantage that you and Brad have is that"
2215.6,2218.9599999999996, you're obviously coming into this very much with your eyes open.
2218.9599999999996,2219.9599999999996, Definitely.
2219.9599999999996,2223.7599999999998," I mean, it's the mistake you see with other MMO developers, I think, because they"
2223.7599999999998,2225.7999999999997, don't realize it what they're making.
2225.7999999999997,2227.2, It's actually like a service.
2227.2,2228.7999999999997, And not a product.
2228.7999999999997,2229.7999999999997, That's true.
2229.7999999999997,2234.68," It's a service like any other thing, you know, running an airline, what have you?"
2234.68,2237.52, Operating at cable TV station.
2237.52,2244.68," You have to understand that your product has to be updated, it has to be maintained, you have"
2244.68,2249.48," a live team, you have expansions, you have customer service, and everything you do."
2249.48,2253.8399999999997, All the game design elements have to be set up like an amusement park where the game
2253.8399999999997,2255.48, is meant to flow.
2255.48,2259.3999999999996," People come in, people go out, they experience the content."
2259.3999999999996,2264.3999999999996," At times, they may leave the game, get a welcome them back, get a good reason to come"
2264.48,2267.2400000000002," back, so on and so forth."
2267.2400000000002,2273.1600000000003," It was really amazing to me that I spent the weekend playing ever across one, your old"
2273.1600000000003,2274.1600000000003, game.
2274.1600000000003,2279.6800000000003," It was amazing to me how much it's actually changed now in response, obviously the graphics"
2279.6800000000003,2285.56," haven't really, but in response to not just wow, but I guess everything that's come after"
2285.56,2287.36, very true.
2287.36,2294.36," It did remind me how originally, how really kind of unfriendly it was."
2294.36,2297.92, I don't think deliberately you weren't saying I got to make an unfriendly mean game.
2297.92,2298.92, Not at all.
2298.92,2300.32, It's more like the convention at the time.
2300.32,2301.32, That's true.
2301.32,2306.88," Back in the day, we remember conversations between developers where some element of frustration,"
2306.88,2312.92," either in UO or everquest would be brought up, either by a player or another developer."
2312.92,2319.2000000000003," Why didn't care for X, Y, or Z, and sometimes the response would be, well, then design"
2319.2000000000003,2323.52, a better system because we're looking at the game and we haven't come up with something
2323.52,2326.64, to fix this particular element of frustration.
2326.64,2331.64," The way the game plays right now is the only way we could figure out to make it, or the"
2331.64,2335.96, way we had time to code it or whatever else the case may be.
2335.96,2342.88," Being able to identify what elements of design were the underpinnings of everquest success,"
2342.88,2347.12, and which ones hampered everquest success.
2347.12,2350.7200000000003, All of that was our early goals in concepting Vanguard.
2350.7200000000003,2356.8, We still had everything on a piece of paper and it was 12 guys in an office talking about
2356.8,2362.4," an envisioning the game that we were going to build, distilling everquest UO and the other"
2362.4,2368.6800000000003, products that were on the market for what made them a success and what hampered their success.
2368.72,2373.2799999999997, And what reduced their subscriber base was one of our key goals.
2373.2799999999997,2379.54, So what do you think are at least a couple of the things that were success as to you in
2379.54,2383.96, EQ1 that still carry over now to Vanguard all these years later?
2383.96,2391.7999999999997, One of the things that we've actually struggled with in terms of design was the entertainment
2391.7999999999997,2398.48," value of fear or suspense, the fact that in everquest you could ostensibly die and lose"
2398.52,2402.52, your corpse because you're absolutely decay after a certain period of time.
2402.52,2407.76," As you were exploring an area that you weren't familiar with, there was real danger."
2407.76,2412.0, You could lose hundreds of hours of your personal achievement.
2412.0,2415.64, And because of that it instilled in a sense of fear.
2415.64,2419.04, What's around the corner of that next dungeon corridor?
2419.04,2420.04, I don't know.
2420.04,2421.68, And I'm not going to find out.
2421.68,2424.6, Let's wait till somebody else goes down there and it gives us a report where there could
2424.6,2425.88, be a trap door there.
2425.96,2429.2400000000002, You could fall through to a lower level of the dungeon and never make it back out.
2429.2400000000002,2433.48, And our corpses were rot because we're the highest level players in the game right now.
2433.48,2434.48, That happened.
2434.48,2438.56," That situation, that exact situation happened to us quite a few times running up through"
2438.56,2440.76, everquest in the early beta.
2440.76,2447.7200000000003, And that's one element that is very difficult to capture because it's tied so strongly to
2447.7200000000003,2449.2400000000002, frustration.
2449.2400000000002,2453.0, You can't really take hundreds of hours of players progress away.
2453.0,2458.08," So in modern MMOs, I find that element of entertaining, sorely lacking."
2458.08,2459.6, There is no fear.
2459.6,2462.72, I have no fear when I'm leveling up in a while or I'm rating.
2462.72,2465.32, I'm not really going to lose anything.
2465.32,2466.6, And I missed that.
2466.6,2473.68, So trying to engineer that in the Vanguard has been quite a challenge for sure.
2473.68,2478.96," When I was playing everquest one, I was in I've seen all these things that they've added"
2478.96,2481.04, now to make it easier and friendly.
2481.2799999999997,2487.64, It was amazing to me to think back that this game used to not have things like a map.
2487.64,2490.2799999999997," You just didn't, you had to know where you were going."
2490.2799999999997,2494.7599999999998, Or you had to map it out in the old days with graph paper.
2494.7599999999998,2499.24, So I didn't see what else didn't have.
2499.24,2503.24," There were really, there were quests but there wasn't any kind of quest log or whatever."
2503.24,2504.8, You had to keep a notebook.
2504.8,2505.8, Right.
2505.8,2508.8, You had to write down the NPC name who gave you the quest.
2508.8,2512.48, Write down where he was at and just go from there.
2512.48,2515.92, Many times I didn't know where to turn the quest in.
2515.92,2516.92, It wasn't paying attention.
2516.92,2519.04, Whatever the case may be.
2519.04,2524.1600000000003, There were quite a few elements of gameplay that are in modern games that were lacking in
2524.1600000000003,2525.1600000000003, EQ.
2525.1600000000003,2528.2000000000003, People are just so lazy now.
2528.2000000000003,2532.6800000000003," When I'm playing wow, back in my day we didn't have maps."
2532.6800000000003,2533.6800000000003, I don't mean it that way.
2533.6800000000003,2535.7200000000003, I just mean that.
2535.72,2540.04, When you log on a wow and they give you everything.
2540.04,2541.8399999999997, I mean you've got a map.
2541.8399999999997,2544.24, They put yellow dots on the map.
2544.24,2545.48, You've got the quest log.
2545.48,2547.08, You've got how many of this thing you need.
2547.08,2551.68," Then you still get people going, where's Dingo Berry?"
2551.68,2553.3999999999996, It says right there in the quest.
2553.3999999999996,2556.72, Dingo Berry standing in the tab or whatever.
2556.72,2558.8399999999997, Well actually I have to laugh.
2558.8399999999997,2562.3599999999997, Just this morning in fact somebody was talking to me about some Star Wars Galaxy's
2562.3599999999997,2565.48, functionality that doesn't exist in the basic while client.
2565.52,2568.2400000000002, The ability to mark a waypoint.
2568.2400000000002,2576.08, Here I mark a waypoint in the middle of L-Win Forest where Princess the Bohr spawns.
2576.08,2580.6, That's relevant because that's where all of my ults go through.
2580.6,2585.72, I want to email that waypoint to you because you've just started to play on my server
2585.72,2589.36, and you've never played a line before.
2589.36,2593.04, That's something we could do in Star Wars galaxies that we can't and wow.
2593.04,2598.36," As these games evolve, if you were to sit down today and take Vanguard, wow, all of"
2598.36,2605.68," the wow, interface expansion has come out and combine them all and derive from that a subset"
2605.68,2610.84, of needed elements for what the fourth generation game is going to have to provide the
2610.84,2612.2, players on day one.
2612.2,2614.48, You need 150 men development team.
2614.48,2620.96, You need a full five years and an ungodly budget to put it all together because that's
2621.04,2624.04, what players are going to ask for.
2624.04,2626.92," If you don't give it to them, they'll find a way to make it themselves."
2626.92,2628.88, Look at all the wow mods.
2628.88,2635.48, They're going to modify the game to play in the manner that they choose or they find
2635.48,2641.7200000000003, most appealing and then the mods themselves are going to evolve over the years to be specifically
2641.7200000000003,2643.96, what the players are looking for.
2644.2,2651.32," Going into Vanguard then, do you guys feel like are you mod open and are you welcoming them"
2651.32,2652.32, most definitely.
2652.32,2657.6," And in fact, some of the mods that exist for the modern games out there right now are"
2657.6,2661.4, reflected in some core functionality in Vanguard.
2661.4,2666.6, The way if you've ever played wow and experience de-curse of anytime somebody in your
2666.6,2670.84, party gets a curse placed on them or some other affliction that your character class
2670.84,2675.08," has the ability to cure your little pop up, you know, pop up, it tells you what the"
2675.08,2679.0, affliction is and just click on the icon right next to it and your character targets
2679.0,2685.44, them and removes scrubs the debuff or whatever it is automatically that works very similar
2685.44,2690.88, to the reaction system in Vanguard where if you've got someone as your defensive target
2690.88,2695.2400000000002," and they're taking damage, your tank, you can rescue them and intercept the damage that"
2695.2400000000002,2699.92," they're taking and you get an icon that pops up on your screen, you've got a hot key"
2700.0,2703.2000000000003, automatically executes that or you can click it with your mouse.
2703.2000000000003,2705.08, So it's like a mod.
2705.08,2709.64, So thinking about not only the games that are out there but what players are trying to get
2709.64,2716.0," out of them that maybe they don't even offer waypoints and wow, they had Star Wars galaxies,"
2716.0,2722.6800000000003," de-curse of things of that nature, things like damage meters, threat meters, you name it."
2722.6800000000003,2723.84, That's what everyone wants.
2723.92,2731.2000000000003," I think even Everclass 1 now has not waypoints but you know, you can get that little trail"
2731.2000000000003,2732.92, feeding to the next thing.
2732.92,2733.92, The little silver thread.
2733.92,2734.92, Right.
2734.92,2736.08, Yeah.
2736.08,2738.6400000000003, Which was amazing to me to see.
2738.6400000000003,2744.8, I think Neocron was the first game that had that actual thread to lead you someplace
2744.8,2749.4," and Star Wars galaxies picked up on it because their cities were complex and you know,"
2749.4,2753.48," if there was a quest NPC or a trainer, if you didn't know where it was, there was no"
2753.56,2754.84, way to find it.
2754.84,2761.0, So they instituted the little system of lines and arrows that you could follow along on the ground.
2761.0,2762.0," Yeah, it was smart."
2762.0,2763.0, Yep.
2763.0,2764.0, It works.
2764.0,2766.4, And that's another added element of complexity in these games.
2766.4,2768.4, Many people come into a 3D world space.
2768.4,2770.04, They're unfamiliar with it.
2770.04,2775.12," And if you don't find a way to let them know about your world and where they are, where"
2775.12,2781.92," to get around, then you've got one day, one hour, 30 days before they quit."
2781.92,2791.08," Same back in the EQ one day said, you were almost deliberately secretive about the geography."
2791.08,2797.04, Like I remember being a magazine editor back then and we were trying to get maps out of you
2797.04,2798.04, guys.
2798.04,2804.64, We thought it would be cool if we could print this area and there was this real sort of hesitancy.
2804.64,2806.92, We want the players to figure this out on the ground.
2807.0,2808.36, I remember it well.
2808.36,2815.88, That was back in the day when the thinking was that all elements of the game other than
2815.88,2820.64, the very first entry level experience was a reward for player achievement.
2820.64,2824.6," You want to know your way around, neck to low forest."
2824.6,2828.12, You've got to level up or you've got to get somebody in your guild who knows.
2828.12,2831.4, That's the reward that the game offers.
2831.4,2839.4," I think as these products have evolved, we've come to learn that it's the actual gameplay,"
2839.4,2845.4, the knowledge of the intricacies of the encounters and the dungeons and don't turn left
2845.4,2846.88, and kill that mini boss first.
2846.88,2851.04, You've got to go to the right and get the too many bosses in the spawn before you kill
2851.04,2853.48, him for the following reason.
2853.48,2856.2400000000002, That's where player knowledge seems to reside.
2856.2400000000002,2858.64, People are a little bit more happy with it.
2858.64,2865.8799999999997, In a way to might have been the internet that helped maybe in a way force developers to
2865.8799999999997,2871.92," have to give up that kind of notion because like Alicazam and EQ Atlas, that's the one."
2871.92,2876.64," It's one of those things where if you don't create EQ Atlas, someone else is going"
2876.64,2878.24, to come and do it for you.
2878.24,2883.6, Then even those things that you did hold aside is player knowledge and reward are given
2883.6,2885.6, to every player at low level.
2885.6,2888.2, I thought boss would get example of that as well.
2888.2,2892.68, That's my gear progression for a Taran hunter from 30 to 40.
2892.68,2895.68, Well thought bot will probably tell me that if that's what I want to know.
2895.68,2900.12, I can experience it in the game or I can just go find out very quickly.
2900.12,2905.72," Again, I guess I just have mixed feelings about it all because it feels like you're kind"
2905.72,2911.56, of right in a way that it seems like something gets a little lost in all of this being
2911.56,2913.7599999999998, so easily available to everybody.
2913.84,2919.0400000000004," I mean on the other hand, you don't want to be like an Alidist, you know, I don't know."
2919.0400000000004,2925.1200000000003," Yeah, it would be tough from a developer standpoint to prevent people from honestly"
2925.1200000000003,2929.0400000000004, obtaining that information and displaying it.
2929.0400000000004,2930.32, It's one of those things.
2930.32,2940.0," A lot of times I look at the Japanese RPGs and if you take the console, Japanese RPGs as a"
2940.08,2945.36, cross section and you look at what the players seem to seek and what they're willing to invest
2945.36,2949.2," their money in and I'm not just talking about the money that they spent on the original game,"
2949.2,2954.0, but they'll go in years afterwards and they'll buy every manual and every reference work that
2954.0,2958.96," that shows a picture of every weapon in the game in the hands of every single character,"
2958.96,2964.0," race and class, every suit of armor in the game worn by every single race and class."
2964.96,2970.96, The stats detailed out for every single monster and its appearances throughout every level range.
2970.96,2978.96, People really like those collections of information and they pay good money for those things.
2978.96,2984.16," The websites that compile that stuff get massive amounts of traffic, they get bought up,"
2984.16,2985.44, they become very popular.
2985.44,2992.72, I think what will end up doing at least for the near future is allowing
2994.32,3001.92, the people outside of sigil to pursue that will remain as close mouth about those faxes possible
3001.92,3007.6, and will let people gather those details and that way players in the game can choose to
3007.6,3010.4, pursue that impression or they can play the game fresh.
3010.4,3016.32," Right and the great thing is that information will be out there and it will have cost you zero,"
3016.32,3019.2, zero time and effort on your own.
3019.2,3022.64," Yeah and at some point in time, people doing your work for you know for you."
3022.64,3027.92," At some point in time, maybe we'll offer a compilation in the manner of some of the final fantasy"
3029.6,3030.8799999999997, single player RPGs.
3030.8799999999997,3034.16, I bet hell I mean Blizzard doesn't get anything out of thought bought right.
3034.16,3035.44, I mean that's absolutely not.
3035.44,3037.92, It's gigantic and psychopathia that they had nothing to do with.
3037.92,3039.6, So I should do bother.
3039.6,3041.44," Yep, nothing to do with at all."
3041.44,3044.48, And a lot of the content is spoiled there.
3045.2,3046.7999999999997," Yeah, that's the thing."
3046.88,3053.04," I mean you know, I was playing while just earlier today and just with a low-be character that"
3053.04,3056.7200000000003, so it's already it was in wetlands so it's something I've already been through 10 times.
3057.52,3063.36, But I had to turn in this quest that was somewhere in the middle of the zone.
3064.2400000000002,3066.6400000000003, I could not remember for the life of me where the guy was.
3066.6400000000003,3067.1200000000003, Yep.
3067.1200000000003,3073.84, And I just sat there like like okay I could all tab and go to thoughtbot or I can actually like play the game
3073.92,3077.84, and find it myself and I said okay I'm going to get myself like two more minutes to find him and then
3077.84,3078.88, I'm going to thoughtbot.
3078.88,3079.2000000000003, Yep.
3079.2000000000003,3082.2400000000002, And then I waited about 30 more seconds and then I just went to thoughtbot.
3082.6400000000003,3086.1600000000003, And there he was and there was a little map where he was and it's like well
3087.1200000000003,3088.08, now what am I doing?
3088.7200000000003,3089.1200000000003, You know.
3089.1200000000003,3094.88, The last time I ran through I was trying to time myself and get and get to 60 has fast as humanly
3094.88,3095.6800000000003, possible.
3095.6800000000003,3101.36, And so I relied upon you know the wow wiki and the thought bots to tell me exactly where everything was
3101.52,3104.0, because I really wasn't looking to experience the content.
3104.0,3106.4, I was just on a time to run to 60.
3106.4,3108.96, But that's that's one element of replayability.
3108.96,3110.0, Yeah that's yeah.
3110.0,3111.52, And I kind of different.
3111.52,3112.32, Yes.
3112.32,3116.4, But if you're what if it was your very first character and you were doing that?
3116.4,3122.8, You know my first run through wow thoughtbot existed and I have to say I generally relied upon my
3122.8,3126.08, guild to let me know what to do and where to go.
3126.08,3129.1200000000003, I didn't really refer to thoughtbot if we were going to run to some
3129.12,3129.7599999999998, content.
3129.7599999999998,3133.68, I just said okay guys I got four quests for some content right now.
3133.68,3134.88, Is that all the ones I need?
3134.88,3138.24, No I don't know go to you know the go to the storm wind.
3138.24,3140.96, There's a dwarf in a tavern in the in the old town.
3140.96,3145.04, Or in the dwarven section you need to get talked to that guy because you get one more quest for you.
3145.04,3147.04, Okay so five quest is all in need?
3147.04,3150.7999999999997, Yeah and this is from guild members who have gone through it 10 times.
3150.7999999999997,3152.08, So does it not bother you?
3152.08,3158.56, I mean you're you're inherently you know obviously deeply involved in your game world.
3159.2799999999997,3164.16, Creating this whole experience and is it going to bother you that you're taking all this time to
3164.16,3168.16, craft it and there's going to be players who aren't going to give a damn about any of the
3168.16,3173.12, lore or the stories you're trying to tell that the you know the quest logs are just going to
3173.12,3174.4, want the stuff.
3174.4,3179.6, You know it doesn't bother me at all because the truth of the matter is there's especially
3179.6,3182.96, nowadays these products have to be many things to different people.
3183.8399999999997,3186.64, Take character customization for example.
3186.7999999999997,3191.44, You could spend four hours customizing a character in vanguard or you could spend four minutes
3191.44,3192.48, or four seconds.
3193.2,3197.92, It's all up to you if you really want a unique looking character that doesn't look like anyone else.
3197.92,3201.2799999999997, You can go you can go and create that for yourself.
3201.2799999999997,3204.56, But if that's not something that's important to you you don't bother with it.
3204.56,3205.2799999999997, Mm-hmm.
3205.2799999999997,3208.16, Um it's all about choices nowadays with these games.
3208.16,3209.2, Do you want a quest?
3209.2,3210.4, Do you want a grind?
3210.4,3213.68, Do you want to harvest and craft or do you want to adventure?
3213.68,3214.0, Mm-hmm.
3214.96,3222.24, So many people represent different gameplay styles but are still great subscribers.
3222.24,3229.2," Social glue, you know from the housewife who's got two hours in the evening to play to the the"
3229.2,3237.28, Uber guild guild master who commands 200 people at a whim and who covers all bases in every game
3237.28,3238.56, that that he plays.
3239.28,3243.84, You got to give those people all the choices that they need because after all we're asking
3243.92,3249.76, people to take all the time that they've invested in other massively multiplayer games and walk away from it and come to hours.
3249.76,3250.4, Yeah.
3250.4,3257.2000000000003, We've got to give them what they're looking for and make it worth their while to spend a year or a year and a
3257.2000000000003,3263.6800000000003, half or more of their time in our game kind of build them a world where they can feel they can make a
3263.6800000000003,3267.76, difference something that will grow with them provide them some challenge.
3268.7200000000003,3274.1600000000003, Let them build their guild ship and their guild mansion so on and so forth eventually
3274.1600000000003,3276.8, playercrafted cities things of that nature.
3277.6800000000003,3283.1200000000003, I really have a lot of respect for what you guys are doing because it seems like it's such a huge
3283.92,3287.76," gamble, you know it's not this is not like I mean you don't need me to tell you this."
3287.76,3294.32, This is not like making a coin-a-quand-a-quate regular game absolutely investment is is you know
3294.4,3297.36, kind of mind-boggling can't even like get your head around it.
3297.36,3302.6400000000003, It certainly is and at this point it's the game we want to play.
3303.36,3309.76, It's from the day we first started talking about it we envisioned Vanguard as kind of the evolution
3309.76,3314.1600000000003, of the games that we were playing. We wanted to see come down the pike in the future.
3314.88,3319.52, I mean there will be games we'll work on games after Vanguard that'll be even more complex than this one.
3320.4,3325.12, Far more daunting undertakings than this particular one.
3325.84,3334.16, We're just building the genre right now. Trying to find even new styles of gameplay like diplomacy
3334.16,3339.36, that can fit within a massively multiplayer game make the fantasy world or the science fiction world
3339.36,3344.88, feel more real to the player. Cover more bases. At some point in time in the future you might
3344.96,3350.56, be able to crack up in a fantasy novel and read through it for five chapters and say you know
3350.56,3358.6400000000003, there's some representation of gameplay in my MMO of the year that covers every single thing
3358.6400000000003,3363.6, that existed in this fantasy novel from a couple of different directions. I could do all of the
3363.6,3368.56, stuff just a matter of time people come up with it. If you look at the full cross section at
3368.64,3376.16, PC and console games from guitar hero all the way up to like Europe of 1400 at PC game
3377.36,3385.36, people have already envisioned and made reality games that have very disparate styles and types of play
3386.0,3391.36, different goals different methods of execution and success within that within the gameplay.
3391.76,3398.48, Bundling all those in an MMO is going to happen. Right. The Wii controller would be another one.
3398.48,3406.4, There you go. Yeah. All sorts of neat stuff. It'll happen. The future is going to be cool.
3406.4,3413.1200000000003, It's definitely going to be cool. Yeah. Glad we're living now. I am too. This is you know I've always
3413.1200000000003,3419.6800000000003, wanted to develop games. I've always enjoyed playing them and this is the opportunity to make
3419.7599999999998,3424.3199999999997, those genre to define it. It's to sit around at a table like this and talk about what's
3424.3199999999997,3429.9199999999996, going to happen next to decide. What are we going to work on next? Here's a great idea. Let's
3429.9199999999996,3433.7599999999998, make it happen in the next game. We're in the expansion of the game we're working on right now.
3434.3199999999997,3440.3199999999997, No better time. Cool for you guys too because you've already made ever quest.
3440.3199999999997,3445.9199999999996, Yes. You kind of have nothing to prove in a way. I mean I know you probably don't feel that way.
3446.2400000000002,3455.28, It'll be nice. It'll be very nice to have a second success. I never hope to be
3455.28,3465.76, let's say using an example of the artist who is now composing music for him. He has become
3465.76,3471.76, so wealthy and so successful that you can't produce him and you can't tell him to play something
3471.84,3477.1200000000003, that's commercial. He's off on his own. Now his avid fans may still follow his work.
3477.1200000000003,3481.6800000000003, Right. But he's not commercial or mainstream anymore. Right. I want to stay mainstream. I want
3481.6800000000003,3487.76, to stay talking to people like yourself who keep it real. Who say Jeff you know is your game
3487.76,3492.4, going to be appealing to me because if you're not appealing to me then you're often left field
3492.48,3500.7200000000003, someplace. I want to stay on track making mainstream games evolving the genre with oversight
3500.7200000000003,3506.8, and partners and people you know in a large group participating collaboratively to make these
3506.8,3512.64, products. That's where success is going to come. I think in the future. That's where all the fun's
3512.64,3518.32, going to be. Well I do we see the best and I hope that we're not going to have to you know
3519.1200000000003,3525.76, give you a better view or anything. I hope that too. Thank you very much. That's kind of suck to
3525.76,3530.0, work on something for five years and then have some smart ass to sort of dismiss your game in
3530.0,3536.0, 500 words. You know these things stand on their own merit. We're working to make it as fun as we
3536.0,3542.56, possibly can and we won't be satisfied until we want to play it and you know we'll be right there
3542.56,3547.6000000000004, with you complaining if it's not what we want it to be. Hopefully none of us will have to complain.
3547.68,3552.64, I hear that. Okay. Well thank you for coming in Jeff. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
3552.64,3558.0, Thanks and good luck on the game and we'll check out with you again. Sounds good.
3558.0,3560.0, We'll forward to it. Thanks.
