0.0,15.0," Hello and welcome to the CGW radio podcast for September 6, 2006. This is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of computer gaming magazine, computer gaming magazine."
15.0,24.0, I don't even know what magazine I were heard. Do we need to take to now? We'll let it roll. This is live radio computer gaming magazine.
24.0,33.0," That's nice. I've only been here 10 years computer gaming world magazine, at least for another six or eight weeks or so."
33.0,40.0," Anyway, I'm here with the staff of computer gaming magazine, who are as follows."
40.0,47.0," Ryan Scott, Daring Ladsdoh. Sean Elliott. And it's nice to see you all in the same room with gentlemen."
47.0,53.0, We have been apart on all on distant shores going our different ways for quite a while now.
53.0,63.0," Too long. First time we've all been back to the vacation vacation. And now that we're all back together, there's people with a different look. Ryan has a her suit beard now."
63.0,64.0, Believe it or not.
64.0,73.0," Rocket the chin strap rocking the chin strap. Yeah, he's bringing old school for the old CW and Sean Elliott has a junkie new cap on."
73.0,75.0," Oh, very John. Yeah."
75.0,83.0," Paper Mr. Right. Yeah, this kind of that kind of the old school reporter or yeah, paper boy."
83.0,85.0, And you see. And Daring's bald. Yeah.
85.0,96.0," I'm letting it show him. And Sean Malaya. Well, you did a bit beard and then you shaved it and now you look like one of those guys in a grow beard in like three days because already you're like scruffy again."
96.0,98.0," Yeah, it goes pretty fast."
98.0,104.0, I find that annoying because I want to take me like weeks to get any hair gone.
104.0,109.0," So anyway, we have anything else to talk about that when our facial hair."
109.0,114.0," We do in fact, that was a rhetorical question. We have a lot to talk about this week."
114.0,118.0, We'll do our usual round of what you're playing. Of course.
118.0,125.0," We got some confirmation on the vista pricing, which hopefully we won't have the hammer on too much about that."
125.0,129.0," We will define the word, blog for you this week. That's exciting."
129.0,133.0, We may or may not have news for you on Starcraft 2.
133.0,136.0, I think emphasis on the knot.
136.0,138.0, It's too defined that we don't.
138.0,144.0," I say, we're going to look at the top 10 PC games with a couple random weird surprises on there."
144.0,149.0, We're going to check in on the Lipes Zig game convention over in Germany.
149.0,155.0, Apparently they have decided to stop conquering other nations and just play video games over in Germany.
155.0,159.0, I'm sorry. I didn't need to do that today.
159.0,160.0, You had to go there.
160.0,165.0," It's kind of impossible not to slam Germany when you're, you know."
165.0,169.0," It's kind of weird. When I was there in Frankfurt when I came back from Frankfurt for a crisis story,"
169.0,171.0," I was like, so how is Nazi land?"
171.0,175.0," I was like, rather similar to Slayman genocide land."
175.0,181.0," I mean, we just forget that we've got our own skills and our classes."
181.0,184.0, It'll be like the coolest part of Disney World.
184.0,187.0, Slayman genocide land.
187.0,188.0, Sweet.
188.0,190.0," Well, it's true that when you go over to Europe, they're all like,"
190.0,192.0, so it's true everybody carries guns there.
192.0,195.0," So they, you know, it's all in perspective. It's where you're at."
195.0,197.0, So that's foremost on your mind.
197.0,198.0," And look, it we're playing games all the time."
198.0,201.0," So like I was saying when I was there during the World Cup,"
201.0,206.0, I hear the police events pull up and guys just yelling and German out of
206.0,207.0, megaphone's out of them.
207.0,211.0," It's like, it's like, on some level, like when was the last time I heard that?"
211.0,212.0," Oh, yeah, like metal of honor something."
212.0,214.0," So I'm like, you know what I heard?"
214.0,216.0, You're German coming out of a megaphone.
216.0,220.0," Sure. But I think, you know, if you were bar mitzveth like Darren and I were,"
220.0,224.0," yeah, you hear people like yelling in German, your tendencies just kind of run in the other direction."
224.0,226.0, Or look for a train car.
226.0,228.0," Nevertheless, that was a long time ago."
228.0,232.0, And we probably shouldn't hold our young German friends to that.
232.0,233.0, Not at all.
233.0,235.0, They don't need to pay for their sins.
235.0,236.0, Do they?
236.0,237.0," If anything, they're probably the coolest people out there."
237.0,239.0," No, they have the most level heads on things."
239.0,241.0," Well, I like to think I would at least."
241.0,242.0, I hope.
242.0,243.0, I don't know.
243.0,246.0, Maybe let's get away from actually why we're talking about.
246.0,248.0, Not tonight.
248.0,250.0, So we're not just laughing.
250.0,257.0," Well, let's get back to games before we get a legal notice from the German office."
257.0,260.0," Actually, I would bet speaking of paying for sins."
260.0,263.0," Darren, maybe you can talk about what you were playing this week."
263.0,264.0, Has it?
264.0,265.0," Oh, geez."
265.0,266.0, You can like that segue.
266.0,267.0, That was such a great segue.
267.0,269.0, I'm now going to pay for this.
269.0,272.0, So I started playing left behind a journal for us.
272.0,273.0, It's just a really shot.
273.0,274.0, Oh.
274.0,275.0," Yeah, I know."
275.0,276.0, And you know what?
276.0,280.0," I'm going to, I really wish that there was someone else here to play."
280.0,281.0," Like, me counterpoint."
281.0,284.0," So I don't feel like I'm going to, I don't want to bash the game."
284.0,285.0, Tell the folks.
285.0,286.0, I can play this game is.
286.0,288.0," Okay, so left behind a journal for us."
288.0,289.0, I'll play the lesson behind that.
289.0,290.0, Okay.
290.0,291.0, Thank you.
291.0,295.0," So basically, the game for those who've, for me, there's a whole book series."
295.0,297.0, Apparently Kirk Cameron in the movies.
297.0,298.0, The idea is.
298.0,299.0, I didn't know that.
299.0,300.0," Yeah, we haven't had that."
300.0,302.0, Can't ever kid anymore.
302.0,303.0," Come on, dude."
304.0,305.0, You can't even pay.
305.0,311.0," Anyway, so the rapture has come and all those who believe that Jesus is your personal Savior."
311.0,312.0, Get saved.
312.0,313.0, Boom.
313.0,316.0, Everyone just gets millions of people disappear off the planet at once.
316.0,317.0, Everyone else.
317.0,318.0, Everyone else.
318.0,319.0, Everyone else.
319.0,320.0, Everyone else.
320.0,321.0, Everyone else.
321.0,322.0, Left behind.
322.0,324.0, So I'm playing this game.
324.0,325.0, And I'm thinking of myself.
325.0,327.0," Let's say, like, I'm going to roll play for a second."
327.0,329.0, Let's say I'm a 13 year old Jew in New York playing this game.
329.0,332.0," And I'm like, the message this game is going to tell me is,"
332.0,334.0, I'm not going to be saved.
334.0,336.0, I'm going to hell or just let it go.
336.0,337.0, But that is their message.
337.0,338.0, That's the truth.
338.0,342.0," If I was making, okay, remember I'm the advocate of getting here."
342.0,343.0, I don't know.
343.0,344.0," Yeah, what do you mean that's the truth?"
344.0,349.0," Say if I was making historical game for you, you know, based on whatever"
349.0,352.0," Were you like and all of a sudden I said, well, it was really the new"
352.0,353.0, Ginians who won.
353.0,358.0," And you said, well, I'm a new, and you said, well, I'm from some other country."
358.0,360.0, And I want to be the one that wins.
360.0,364.0, There and this is just a simply a factual historical game.
364.0,370.0," Well, I guess my, my only real beef is that, I mean, obviously it's, it's from their perspective."
370.0,372.0, And they're trying to be kind of balanced about it.
372.0,374.0," And that respect, I kind of get with their trying to do."
374.0,376.0, But there's other parts that I find amusing.
376.0,379.0," I mean, like as I start looking through it, I mean, like why pick New York."
379.0,382.0," I mean, you know, all the good stuff goes down in New York."
382.0,383.0, I guess that's a cultural mecca.
383.0,387.0," There and also like this game isn't, I mean, you're obviously not the demographic"
388.0,389.0, I'm not a demographic.
389.0,392.0," I know, but isn't this game basically being sold to?"
392.0,393.0," Well, that's being sold to everyone."
393.0,394.0, They're looking to sell out there.
394.0,397.0," They're looking to get, okay, I actually, I respect the fact that making the game and trying to get,"
397.0,400.0, get a message out there and start that conversation.
400.0,403.0," Because on some level, I think it needs to happen."
403.0,408.0," But on the other hand, I mean, like one of the evil conversion units of the game is a rock musician."
408.0,409.0, So rock is evil.
409.0,413.0, And the musicians are singer song and the good guys are singer song.
413.0,414.0, What about Chris?
414.0,415.0," You know, we're not a rock."
415.0,416.0, And the track chanson.
416.0,417.0, I don't know.
417.0,418.0," You know, we're not a rock."
418.0,419.0, They do.
419.0,420.0, In fact.
420.0,424.0, I actually let me say if anybody's listening.
424.0,428.0," And that we are not being, well, maybe we are a little bit."
428.0,432.0, But we're not being judgmental about the political religious viewpoints.
432.0,437.0," Everybody in the staff, you know, we all have our own views or whatever."
437.0,440.0," This is a say minor series to squamer here, because this can be a, this can be a,"
441.0,443.0, There's an interesting question because emotional discussion.
443.0,447.0," In the emotional discussion, we play all these fantasy games set whatever."
447.0,452.0," They've got semi religious theme, you know, doom and whatnot, stop right here."
452.0,457.0, The differences that it's being put forth in a series in a pseudo series context.
457.0,463.0," You know, saying that this is like, you know, as playing the advocate saying that this is more or less."
463.0,468.0," As accurate as we can get to predicting the future based on, you know, the gospel or whatever."
468.0,475.0," Maybe, maybe I don't know, maybe this is offensive too to, I mean, to some Christians, you know, I mean, this maybe they get it wrong, because certainly, right,"
475.0,483.0," I think that that that Christians don't agree on is this time and, you know, the rapture and time is not all the sort of thing."
483.0,485.0, So it's just built for controversy.
485.0,491.0," In the same way, if you made a Muslim one and, you know, you, the question would then be, you know, are you leaning more toward one camp,"
491.0,497.0," or you lean more toward the other, are there, you know, what, what do we, what's the accepted sort of, you know,"
497.0,500.0, the scripture for the end of the world and this and that?
500.0,503.0," Right, I mean, and I say at the end of the day, it's actually a pretty interesting game."
503.0,510.0," I mean, like, from what I played so far in the demo, I mean, like, it's, I mean, the context of how the game is played makes some sense."
510.0,512.0," That's the probably the first part, is it a good game?"
512.0,518.0," Yeah, I mean, like, actually, like, I haven't gotten too far into it, and it's just a, you know, a tutorial, a couple demo levels, but I mean, really,"
518.0,525.0," you could, if you, if you plucked out the religion parts and you put in like some fake religion for works and whatever,"
525.0,528.0, you'd still think this was kind of an interesting kind of game.
528.0,535.0," What's there like, are there Uber units, you know, like, the apostles or something, you know, Peter to see come down and whatever."
535.0,537.0," Not, yeah, I haven't gotten that far into it."
537.0,539.0," Is it as radis like Miguel, have you seen that movie?"
539.0,545.0," Miguel, it's like the sequel to, I forget the first one was the mega code."
545.0,547.0," Yeah, oh, yeah, okay."
547.0,548.0, I don't know.
548.0,549.0, I don't know.
549.0,551.0, I don't know.
552.0,553.0, Do you get that with the game?
553.0,558.0," Did they have like any of the art stuff and revelation come down like, we love eyes and stuff?"
558.0,564.0," No, you know, all that, this stuff is basically strictly, like, you know, base level stuff of them playing so far as you know,"
564.0,570.0," tanks and people and whatnot, and basically, is there, is there base building?"
570.0,573.0, You like build a little community on a cloud or something?
573.0,575.0," Well, no, it's not, it all takes place in New York, so basically."
575.0,576.0," Oh, it's on New York."
576.0,579.0," So the idea is basically, it's because you're the ones left behind."
579.0,580.0, Exactly.
580.0,583.0," Look, that out ticket is an RTS from it, man."
583.0,584.0, You're already in heaven.
584.0,585.0, You're fighting the prizes.
585.0,590.0," This is when you like, you resist and you either take the mark of the beast on your head to,"
590.0,593.0," to be able to, I'm just going to do transactions and this and that, or you're,"
593.0,597.0," If you win, do you get beamed up or you no longer like left behind?"
597.0,598.0," I didn't win, so."
598.0,599.0, I can't.
599.0,603.0," No, do you, what are the factions if these are the people who weren't saved?"
603.0,606.0, Who's the one who's the one who's totally gonna bungle the names right now?
606.0,607.0, So I'm just going to say good guys and bad guys.
607.0,610.0," Basically, there's people who kind of like, I wouldn't say born again, but like,"
610.0,613.0," basically, people who are kind of like, you know, their faith has been renewed since the,"
613.0,618.0," the rapture and then there are others who would just become like some kind of international police force,"
618.0,621.0, who kind of unknowingly reciting with the anti-corrosor.
621.0,622.0, That's kind of the general.
622.0,624.0, Do they have yellow stars on their sleeves?
624.0,625.0, Ouch.
625.0,628.0," Oh, no, they've got the mark of the beast on their forehead."
628.0,629.0, Right.
629.0,631.0," I'm, we're in dangerous."
631.0,634.0," Yeah, you know what, I want you to say, you know what, I'm just, that's how it goes."
634.0,635.0, I'm not making that up right.
635.0,642.0," But all it is, all I'm saying is it's not my religion, but I'm still appreciating where they're coming from with the game and it's not like,"
642.0,645.0, it's an interesting way I think to reach.
645.0,646.0, Absolutely.
646.0,649.0, It's the same way that the US Army is doing it with America's Army.
649.0,650.0, Exactly.
650.0,652.0, Here's what kids are doing now.
652.0,656.0," A lot of them instead of TV, so let's try to reach them this way."
656.0,657.0, Right.
657.0,659.0," You know, it's kind of like, Veggie Tales for the first time."
659.0,663.0," I will say, though, I mean, making, making, you know,"
663.0,669.0, being a reverent toward like the book of Revelation is one thing and we're not going there.
669.0,670.0, Wow.
670.0,673.0, Being a reverent toward the left behind series of books is something else altogether.
673.0,674.0, I agree.
674.0,680.0," Like I said, there's, there's by no means like a uniform block of believers that swear by left behind."
680.0,685.0," I mean, there's some of them even, even those that might have, you know, enjoyed the first one by the sixth or seven."
685.0,688.0," They kept wondering, well, how many times are they getting left behind?"
688.0,692.0, And at what point did it stop getting left behind in like the eighth novel and they start to see.
692.0,695.0, They started to make it money off the novel.
695.0,700.0," You know, and I can say, you know, my parents are very, very, very devout Christians."
700.0,703.0, And they want nothing to do with that and stuff.
703.0,708.0, So I think what we need to earn is our own like Jewish RTS now.
708.0,709.0, How about the Hebrew hammer?
709.0,710.0, Just print that into it.
710.0,712.0," Don't you've got that, man."
712.0,715.0, We didn't we have that game in here that was sitting around on the shelf forever.
715.0,716.0, What?
716.0,717.0, Remember that one?
717.0,719.0," It was like the seven day war game or something, but if you really get that right,"
719.0,722.0, it's like pretty excited to stick around.
722.0,724.0, Like left behind and we're sitting in the dark.
724.0,726.0, I'm gonna be the Jewish.
726.0,728.0," Yeah, it would be like, don't mind us."
728.0,730.0," Don't worry, we'll be fine."
730.0,731.0, That's okay.
731.0,734.0," Well, yeah, we'll suffer."
734.0,736.0," Okay, let's get away from it."
736.0,737.0, Please.
737.0,739.0," Yeah, we're just, that was part of what you're playing."
739.0,740.0," Yeah, politics."
740.0,741.0," Yeah, come up."
741.0,742.0," Yeah, coming elections."
742.0,747.0," Anyway, as anybody else been playing anything other than left behind."
747.0,748.0, I'm a planet.
748.0,749.0," Yeah, yeah."
749.0,754.0," Just like demo, or G, we were talking about that in a couple podcasts to go."
754.0,756.0," And now it's like, just pause."
756.0,757.0, It's demo madness.
757.0,760.0," Yeah, there's the 21 Battlefield 2142 beta."
760.0,763.0, There's a dark messiah multiplayer beta that just went public.
763.0,764.0, Yep.
764.0,765.0, You can talk freely about that.
765.0,768.0," It's, there's, well, start with faces of war."
768.0,771.0, I'm just gonna go off like first on all the demos throughout their faces.
771.0,773.0, A war multiplayer demos out there.
773.0,775.0, Call of war as multiplayer demo.
775.0,776.0," Is it the deaf condom, oh yeah?"
777.0,778.0," No, we've been playing deaf condom."
778.0,784.0," I've been playing deaf condom hard core, but that's with our own, you know, advance sort of access to the download."
784.0,787.0, Company heroes multiplayer demo still going strong.
787.0,788.0, Very excited.
788.0,789.0," Yeah, yes."
789.0,790.0, What else?
790.0,793.0, And then the very cool mod point of existence too.
793.0,794.0, That's based on that.
794.0,796.0, I've really been enjoying that.
796.0,798.0, So where to begin in all that?
798.0,802.0," First, we'll get, say something about 2142 to get out of the way."
802.0,805.0," That's, that's pretty much a, and remember what your mother told you."
805.0,806.0, Right.
806.0,811.0," Well, you can't really say, I mean, because I feel qualified to talk about because I have played quite a bit of it."
811.0,817.0," And I can't talk about specifics or whatever it's closed beta, but I can say general and so far,"
817.0,823.0, the general said I can't think of anything positive to say about it.
823.0,824.0, Wow.
824.0,825.0, Wow.
825.0,828.0," So, I mean, any, it's just not satisfying in any way, shit."
828.0,831.0, And you are truly the most hard core.
831.0,832.0, Right.
832.0,833.0, You can't battle field lover.
833.0,834.0," Yeah, you can't call me a dictator."
834.0,837.0, You can't say that I don't get or don't like this series.
837.0,839.0," I think I was, you got a lot of people."
839.0,841.0, I'm over 500 now and be up to you.
841.0,844.0," And I did just as much on 42, played a whole lot of Vietnam."
844.0,847.0, So your take on battlefield 2142 here.
847.0,848.0, It's so far.
848.0,849.0, It's an informed trainer.
849.0,850.0, Yeah.
850.0,851.0, Yeah.
851.0,852.0, Yeah.
852.0,853.0, Yeah.
853.0,855.0," After his, after Sean's warning is, I was ready to just go a scorched earth policy and not install it."
855.0,856.0, But I got my code yesterday.
856.0,857.0, I downloaded it as well.
857.0,858.0, It's sort of checking out.
858.0,862.0," My, my immediate thought was, it's a trim down, but still sloppy."
862.0,865.0, Version of what UT 2004's onslaught mode was.
865.0,867.0, And what planet side tried doing years ago.
867.0,868.0, Okay.
868.0,873.0," So why do we, you know, here we can't talk specifics about, but you plan to decide comes up a lot in the forms and stuff."
873.0,877.0," It's totally, it's a lot of people plan to decide, but in the wrong ways."
877.0,880.0," Can we, can we, how freely can we talk about this or not?"
880.0,882.0, Let's just not because it's not still a close beta.
882.0,883.0, Okay.
883.0,885.0," The other stuff that's open, company here is open now."
885.0,887.0," Dark, my size is open."
887.0,890.0," That dark, my size, I just started playing last night."
890.0,898.0," So so far on that, I can't really give, you know, I'm not going to say, hey, take my word for it on this one and the way I would with some of the other stuff I'll talk about."
898.0,900.0, But not super exciting to me.
900.0,904.0," You know, I mean, the warrior to warrior combat is just really mashy."
904.0,906.0," You go, you can lock on and it's pretty much too."
906.0,915.0, Brute standing in front of each other and you see who can hit the button the fastest or who's got the higher rank because every time you kill someone or capture your territory.
915.0,924.0," You, you can level up and then spend those, you know, attribute points where you want to become stronger better, you know, have better armor in this and that."
924.0,926.0, The sword swing combos are in fact you're in it all.
926.0,930.0," There's not really combos or is a power strike in it in a, in a wimp strike in."
930.0,940.0," It's just the difference between, you know, they call it one, one, one, one, a strike, one like a stance attack and the difference is holding the button for a half second long for the other."
940.0,944.0, I feel like this game is going to be more about the single player anyway.
944.0,947.0, Definitely because we all love the single player things so.
947.0,949.0, And this is different.
949.0,950.0, It's actually a different developer.
950.0,951.0, It's not our cane.
951.0,953.0," It's, I think it's a could you."
953.0,956.0," Yeah, it's could you, which had a spotty record."
956.0,960.0," Right. And you know, part of the thing is, too, is you've got really slow projectile attacks."
960.0,969.0," So when you do decide to play an archer or a spellcaster, you know, say unlike a shooter where you, you get your crossers on to pull the trigger and it's more or less instantaneous."
969.0,971.0, Your damn just guaranteed.
971.0,977.0," Errors and spells might travel really slowly. And so the further someone's away from you, they can move just an inch."
977.0,982.0, It's going to create a huge deviation in your shot. And so sometimes you're wondering if you're hitting them.
982.0,990.0," And then it's really, I think part of what I'm running up against is that I'm coming out with the squad base shooter mentality saying, like, okay, I'm used to like."
990.0,995.0," I can have we've got our medic, we've got our support and we're, we're differentiated in our roles to a degree."
995.0,1002.0," But this you're really differentiated. And you know, so if you are like the spellcaster, you want to be way to help back. You don't want to even get close because"
1002.0,1008.0," Anyone with a sword or something's going to run up and get in your face. And so you really have to say, all right, I'm going to go with my guys."
1008.0,1013.0," I just have to sit back there and throw spells, much as you wouldn't, guild wars or something to heal these guys."
1013.0,1018.0," And you know, I'm sure tries to take more of a sniper role. I mean, I played an early, I could close later this at one point and"
1018.0,1028.0," And like my, my one observation was kind of the same lines as like, you know, whenever I was a spellcaster, I had to like find some kind of really crazy perch sniper spots that no one can get me and you start reading fireballs."
1028.0,1036.0," Right. That's exactly what you do. Yeah. And it just feels, I don't know, it just feels like less dynamic to me. I mean, I like being able to switch weapons here and there and"
1036.0,1039.0, And move quickly between those roles.
1039.0,1042.0," And then here, it's like you're kind of locked in, doing for quite a while."
1042.0,1050.0," The single player game is the exact opposite because it's a very critical kind of flow and that's what's so bad about the single player game. Yeah, you're, you're all powerful and being all the do this."
1050.0,1057.0," Yeah, I really feel like they almost didn't really need the multiplayer. It seemed odd to me. I mean, just as a long time, might magic fan."
1057.0,1060.0," Yeah. And I know that this was a new, I don't want to discourage the effort."
1060.0,1067.0," No, I mean, I hope it comes out in the end. I hope it works out. You know, at least, you know, the tweaking kind of bears out some of the things that we have problems with."
1067.0,1075.0, Yeah. The other thing too is it's in the source engine and like where's the single player component feels definitely unique. It's got this weird vibe.
1075.0,1082.0," And I played so many games and source with the other realistic, you know, texture and assets said that it kind of feels like a source mod."
1082.0,1089.0," In the same way that 2042, like 100% feel odd when I was playing it, it kind of reminded me of the eclipse mod. You ever see that one?"
1089.0,1092.0," No, I know of it. I didn't ever got around the play."
1092.0,1100.0," In some way, I kind of reminded me of that. Yeah. Well, we did play some Defcon with Sean. I don't know if you guys got around to it. No, I didn't."
1100.0,1107.0, But that single player very excited for it. Just been proselytizing like death crazy online where it can where it can folks get.
1107.0,1115.0," Defcon. Well, it's not a fail. Yeah, but it like, introversion is just like working on it is finishing it up right now. And I think it's going out over. Is it going out over steam?"
1115.0,1121.0, I'm not sure about that. I don't know. We don't make sense because they just put up link in the other way.
1121.0,1135.0," If you haven't already, grab umpling. I mean, that game. Oh, that's over on steam now. Yeah, which is we're now. We're talking about publisher introversion. Like, that was their, that was their first first game. Then Darwin came after. And so this is their new one. They're known for really stylized games. Excellent scores."
1135.0,1139.0, Like stylized small and just like I loved up like very different games.
1139.0,1145.0, And I know we have some listeners out there that aren't the biggest PC gamers for whatever reason. You crazy fools just listen to our podcast.
1145.0,1154.0, So this is a Defcon's a game you can play. I don't care what kind of piece of crap like Dell or gateway you got for a high back to school. I'm talking to entry level.
1154.0,1158.0, I'll go like the Dell that comes in the box that you can't open without like the right.
1158.0,1172.0," You could play Defcon on, you know, pretty much anything. It's just not a system hog. It's basically a game you play over maps. It looks like, you know, war games with Matthew Broderick that will drown."
1172.0,1177.0," And so you basically, you know, I mean, you wanted to describe it or do I mean, oh, you go."
1177.0,1189.0," You're basically pick a country or an alliance of nations and you have, you know, missile silos with all your, your nuclear assets. You have radar stations that you set out and then you have air bases."
1189.0,1200.0," Those are your three things that you can set on your various cities. Air bases can launch fighters, which are capable of sort of probing an enemy territory, shooting down enemy bombers as they come in, enemy missiles as well."
1200.0,1205.0," And then you can launch your own bombers for them. And then in addition to that, you've got fleets that you put in the ocean."
1205.0,1212.0," So it's might sound complex, but it's not. There's probably like six assets all together in the game. And then the ocean you have submarines, which you can launch,"
1212.0,1219.0, Newx from carriers to launch bombers and fighter interceptors from also to have Def charges and so on are to find subs.
1219.0,1229.0," And then destroyers to take out carriers. And so it's really simple. And the basically what you, the, the whole strategy is in informing alliances and like being mock you,"
1229.0,1238.0," veiling about things, telling someone that like, hey, let's, let's go get this guy and then really you've independently approach that guy in the, in the separate chat channel and say, hey,"
1238.0,1248.0, I'm going to make it look like we're going to faint on you and he's going to attack. So be ready. Don't go in the launch mode. Use all of your defensive kind of like the strategic events initiative thing that Reagan was on
1248.0,1254.0, Save it for that phase. And then we'll simultaneously go and hit him once he's already in a launch mode and he can't defend.
1254.0,1263.0," So stuff like that. I mean, and you see it in this great. You see all these lines and nukes everywhere and the weird thing about it for me is that even though it's just played on a map,"
1263.0,1269.0, I have more of a sense of the gravity of war and annihilation when I play this game than like the goryest of shooters.
1269.0,1278.0," Interesting. Why is it the scale? It's, I don't know. It's like you look at a map and you see an explosion and the weird soundtracks playing you hear people coughing in the background and like hacking,"
1278.0,1283.0, using and then it's just like 2.5 million kills. Like you're trying to kill as many million.
1283.0,1286.0, It's a time. It's a war room kind of game.
1286.0,1287.0, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1287.0,1288.0, Stockter strains.
1288.0,1289.0, Yeah. Right. Yeah.
1289.0,1293.0, It's the implied violence plus like everyone knows it. Everyone knows that big board kind of.
1293.0,1294.0, Yeah.
1294.0,1300.0," We grew up under that threat. You know, I mean, where we're like, I mean, this is seriously as abstract and as easy as it gets."
1300.0,1304.0," You know, you could this is a war that would be conducted exactly like a game."
1304.0,1305.0, Right.
1305.0,1316.0," So it's even so ironically, it's even because it's just a map and lines going across it and it's shovel board stuff. It's like that's pretty much what it would have would have looked like in the real scenario."
1316.0,1325.0, So it's also a game of fighting deadlines almost because the way it works is there's like four total stages that you'll go through five to have gone levels.
1325.0,1330.0," Yeah. It starts at five and you can do certain things, build certain units during that phase."
1330.0,1343.0, Okay. And then you know that there's a timer coming and you have to just make sure you're set up for deaf can four before we're deaf can four hits and then you're allowed to switch over certain bases to do other things like you can go into
1343.0,1347.0," Launch mode for your like new clear missiles and like, come three."
1347.0,1349.0, So you got to it's it's definitely more.
1349.0,1354.0," But you can start launching your bombers and whatnot three. I mean, you got your your jets and stuff."
1354.0,1356.0, It was move your sub fleet.
1356.0,1361.0, Speaking of deadlines. I really like the fact that you can actually if this game is made for like playing at the office.
1361.0,1366.0, So you can actually like I think it's like a double skate clause so you can instantly minimize the game and like in a window.
1366.0,1367.0," Yeah, it's office mode."
1367.0,1368.0, It's a lot of it.
1368.0,1369.0, Exactly.
1369.0,1372.0, And then it has a little like a little like DEST tray icon.
1372.0,1374.0, So radioactive simple.
1374.0,1375.0, That's funny.
1375.0,1381.0, And then like if there's a kind of event that you have like that demands your attention a little notification pops up so you just hit that and opens the game back up.
1381.0,1382.0, That's cool.
1382.0,1387.0, There are quite a few modes too. There's the diplomacy one and you everyone starts off on the same side.
1387.0,1396.0," And then like it becomes a matter of I mean, it gives you these various incentives to sort of break and and form independent packs within it."
1396.0,1408.0," So basically the the monolithic block starts to splinter into to coalitions and the lines is, but it's a matter of again keeping those secret and trying to figure out if they're actually legitimate or if you're being played."
1408.0,1414.0," And everyone's so nervous all the time. I mean, it really plays into game theory and the prisoners, the lima is a classic scenario."
1414.0,1422.0, And it was actually developed to sort of speculate on the nature of decision making with global thermonuclear war.
1422.0,1437.0," And you get in the scenarios where it says a launch is detected and you can tell that someone launched a missile, but you can't tell who or what unless you're in a full alliance with them and which you agree to like make visible all of your assets and stuff kind of like, you know, the whole mutual assured destruction."
1437.0,1451.0, The agreement we had with they taught where it's like let's just be visible to one another. So we know we're not going to go nuts on it. But so you see a launch detect and you're like who did that and you kind of see the area and you're like that could be my partners.
1451.0,1461.0, The subs doing gotta be North Korea doing it like a first strike initiative on me and then so you might flip out and then start launching back to our him and it turns out you're wrong and it was really the enemy used to knock a sub down.
1461.0,1475.0," But they now you're screwed because you just fired on your friend and it's cool stuff. I mean, it sounds great. Yeah, it's it's really it's all about the execution. I mean, it's probably about the implementation of your ideas rather than then, you know, hand-eye coordination or the, you know,"
1475.0,1481.0," These guys are definitely, you know, they're two for two so far with crisis and I mean, that crisis. Sorry, uplink and Darwin."
1481.0,1493.0," Darwin. Yeah, both I think both of them got like strategy games a year for me came out. Is there any dirt farming? There's no dirt farming. No resources at all. So I love that part about it. It's really except for except for the body count your harvest."
1493.0,1496.0, Kind of it's almost like an online board game or something. Right. Yeah. Right.
1496.0,1497.0, Parts. Yeah.
1497.0,1498.0, Yeah.
1498.0,1499.0, In real time.
1499.0,1502.0, I think it comes out ended this month. Right.
1502.0,1506.0," Yeah. Comes out in mid September. Yeah. So just get it. I mean, don't even know. It's 999."
1506.0,1516.0," It's such a no-bout. So I'm like 99. Wow. Yeah. Boy, I could be wrong. I mean, so go check it. Well, but I think the website is everyone dies.com."
1516.0,1519.0, Really? Yeah. It is.
1519.0,1521.0, Good stuff.
1521.0,1530.0," I felt back because like Google that first and said, just put the dot com in and I was like, like, if someone sees that, you know, you're like, if someone sees your search, you're like, the hell. So"
1530.0,1534.0," you're like, and everyone dies. My next search. Yeah. Right."
1534.0,1538.0, Slair reunion or something. You don't need it.
1538.0,1545.0," So boy, we're going to need this all time just for what you plan. This is what happens when we don't see."
1545.0,1551.0, Yeah. But I got a signal from Mr. Malloy over there that we should snip for a little break.
1551.0,1558.0, Yeah. The cut sign was we're going to be right back after these important words from our sponsors.
1558.0,1573.0," Hello. And welcome to the one-up radio network. If you know the name of the podcast you'd like to hear, press one now."
1573.0,1584.0, You have selected radio PM starring the editors of the official US PlayStation magazine to download an episode at radiokm.oneup.com.
1584.0,1593.0, That's one now to listen to a promo. Press two now.
1593.0,1599.0, In a world ripped apart by war. Only one magazine.
1599.0,1601.0, Hi. We're back.
1601.0,1607.0," Please, I get your sponsors. Now we don't have sponsors. I was getting responsible by whatever pro boy I decide to cut."
1607.0,1609.0, Right. We're sponsored by the EGM podcast.
1609.0,1611.0, Except the EGM. We're getting those.
1611.0,1612.0, Yeah.
1612.0,1616.0, I think it's funny before I keep rattling off of my monopoly and now playing.
1616.0,1617.0, Okay.
1617.0,1618.0, We would play in all these games.
1618.0,1619.0, Yeah.
1619.0,1620.0," You weren't selling your last week, Sean."
1620.0,1621.0, Awesome.
1621.0,1622.0, You can mone along.
1622.0,1625.0," Quick ways to have extra fun in dark, dark,"
1625.0,1627.0," McSignate, Copony Heroes online."
1627.0,1634.0, Dark McSignate has got a way to send audio messages that are pre-recorded to the rest of your team.
1634.0,1635.0, Okay.
1635.0,1636.0, And they make no sense.
1636.0,1638.0, Like you could be sneezing or coughing.
1638.0,1642.0," There's like cheers, sobbing and all this stuff."
1642.0,1645.0," And so like when you just decide as time to sneeze, whatever."
1645.0,1647.0," But well, that's like wild stuff."
1647.0,1648.0, Right.
1648.0,1649.0, But it makes more sense.
1649.0,1650.0, Yeah.
1650.0,1651.0, There's more that's raspberry.
1651.0,1652.0, Okay.
1652.0,1653.0," So it's like, you know, you make a raspberry."
1653.0,1654.0, But there's no larious.
1654.0,1655.0, There's no limits.
1655.0,1658.0, You won't block you out for for abusing the option or something.
1658.0,1662.0, So what you see is like an undead mage walking around in this granny robes.
1662.0,1669.0," It's just like, and like everything he does, he won't stop doing that."
1669.0,1670.0, So that's kind of fun.
1670.0,1671.0, And then another thing he likes.
1671.0,1672.0," Fun, all right."
1672.0,1675.0, We've been meaning to do this is not right.
1675.0,1677.0," And I don't, I should be advocating, but what the hell?"
1677.0,1679.0, Because it's fun and everyone can do it one time in life.
1679.0,1683.0," But in Copony Heroes, if you pick like a 2v2 game,"
1683.0,1687.0, and you have a friend go on the opposite team and you're on opposite teams.
1687.0,1688.0, And then you each have a partner.
1688.0,1691.0," And so right off the bat, you just get your engineers and you go."
1691.0,1696.0, And you start building like anti tank fortifications all around their tank factories and bases and stuff.
1696.0,1697.0, Then it is off.
1697.0,1703.0," So, obviously, you say, I'm defending, you know, I'm helping reinforce in your base and you play it off that way."
1703.0,1706.0," But then like you may respond to tank and it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just like,"
1706.0,1711.0," concrete and offensive on the crap that he's got to then build guys to demolish it or the right, you know,"
1711.0,1713.0, have his engineers go work out.
1713.0,1714.0, That's fun for one time.
1714.0,1718.0," So, you're probably having a, like, the reefing column in CGW."
1718.0,1723.0," Yeah, but that's just like, like, not encouraged because it's so much hate and we don't publicly encourage you,"
1723.0,1724.0, but sometimes it's fun.
1724.0,1726.0," I mean, it's like, I think you should laugh at that."
1726.0,1729.0," If someone did that to me, it's not like you're on your whole game."
1729.0,1731.0," I mean, you just quit out and like, okay, we're gonna cancel that."
1731.0,1734.0, Chances are you're gonna get kicked for lag or something anyway.
1734.0,1736.0," I mean, the odds of that are pretty high."
1736.0,1738.0, I think we've the lot.
1738.0,1740.0, And sometimes I'll laugh at it.
1740.0,1746.0," I remember playing a three way game of, that was an either 8v2 or Starcraft."
1746.0,1747.0, I forget.
1747.0,1748.0, I've been 8v2.
1748.0,1751.0, It was a three way game in this guy said he wanted to ally with me.
1751.0,1757.0," So he built towers all over my cities, you know, to defend, to help defend me."
1757.0,1761.0," But secretly he had, he had allied with the other guy."
1761.0,1762.0," You know, I mean, and so he was right."
1762.0,1763.0, He was a setting it up.
1763.0,1764.0, So he switched it over.
1764.0,1768.0," So there were towers all over and then all the sudden, yeah, he switched the line so I would dead."
1768.0,1769.0, I lied.
1769.0,1770.0, And I laughed.
1770.0,1771.0," I was like, bravo."
1771.0,1772.0, That was well done.
1772.0,1774.0," Well, much, well, yeah."
1775.0,1780.0," I haven't been to have that many times, but like using just stupid goofball stuff and I encourage it actually."
1780.0,1783.0," Yeah, well, this is done with this sense of humority, some creativity."
1783.0,1784.0," Yeah, this is a good thing."
1784.0,1786.0," I mean, we actually are playing these games for fun in theory."
1786.0,1787.0, Right.
1787.0,1789.0," Not to actually win because we're kind of proof something, right?"
1789.0,1790.0, That's always.
1790.0,1791.0, I don't know.
1791.0,1793.0," But from all I, what do you mean playing?"
1793.0,1795.0," Just world of work, craft."
1795.0,1796.0," Yeah, I knew you were going to say that."
1796.0,1799.0, You still have raids on your home calendar come.
1799.0,1801.0, Council raids into my home calendar.
1801.0,1802.0, It's sad.
1802.0,1803.0, Wow.
1804.0,1806.0, So you're fully suck back in.
1806.0,1809.0," Yeah, I'm totally suck back in as of the like the last three weeks."
1809.0,1813.0, Like I had taken a break with my level 60 character for a while and then you go to
1813.0,1817.0," just got into a good guild and I'm totally a hundred percent,"
1817.0,1819.0, hundred and thirty percent.
1819.0,1820.0, It's like back in.
1820.0,1824.0," Sorry, you just like rating full time now or what is your, what is your, what are you doing in"
1824.0,1826.0," Wow, mostly raids."
1826.0,1829.0," And that that's the stuff that takes you know, the crazy time commitment."
1829.0,1831.0," Like the reason you have a calendar is because like,"
1831.0,1834.0, you gotta get 40 people together and you can only do it at 630.
1834.0,1835.0, So let's go.
1835.0,1836.0, All right.
1836.0,1838.0, So are you playing a level 60 guy and yeah.
1838.0,1839.0, Okay.
1839.0,1840.0," Yeah, I've got my priest."
1840.0,1841.0, Got my priest.
1841.0,1843.0, I just got it to 56 last night.
1843.0,1844.0, I'm getting there.
1844.0,1845.0, So.
1845.0,1846.0, Agber does level 56.
1846.0,1847.0, I just come to this.
1847.0,1849.0, I wish we had a soundboard so we can have more dots more dots.
1849.0,1851.0," Yeah, we just wanted to do it."
1851.0,1852.0, We were doing a nixie.
1852.0,1853.0, We were doing only.
1853.0,1855.0, And that's what our guild leader kept saying more dots.
1855.0,1857.0, And then we got yelled at for not putting enough dots on.
1857.0,1858.0, Wow.
1859.0,1860.0, He was serious.
1860.0,1861.0, He was serious.
1861.0,1862.0, He was not a dot.
1862.0,1863.0, It's real.
1863.0,1864.0, That's what you got to do.
1864.0,1865.0, That's what you got to do.
1865.0,1866.0, That's what you got to do.
1866.0,1868.0, That's what you got to do.
1868.0,1869.0, That's what you got to do.
1869.0,1870.0, That's what you got to do.
1870.0,1871.0, There's an nixie.
1871.0,1873.0," No, wasn't an nixie or this current."
1873.0,1874.0, Little.
1874.0,1876.0, If he asked go happened.
1876.0,1877.0," Oh, kelp does odd."
1877.0,1878.0," Yeah, kelp does odd."
1878.0,1879.0, It's rummest.
1879.0,1880.0, Right.
1880.0,1882.0, We weren't you on kelp does odd?
1882.0,1883.0, No.
1883.0,1884.0, Ralphie.
1884.0,1885.0, No.
1885.0,1887.0, No.
1888.0,1889.0, That would not know.
1889.0,1890.0," No, Ralphie this week."
1890.0,1891.0, There.
1891.0,1892.0, I don't know.
1892.0,1893.0, Not in that.
1893.0,1894.0, Nixie.
1894.0,1895.0, I'm tired of hearing about that.
1895.0,1896.0," You know, we don't want to talk about that."
1896.0,1898.0," No, no, just I'm thinking of like,"
1898.0,1899.0," like, it's like, it's so who doesn't play it."
1899.0,1901.0, That's the one thing you always hear about.
1901.0,1902.0, You're about to do it.
1902.0,1903.0," When you're reading,"
1903.0,1904.0," Well, Nixie, I win."
1904.0,1908.0," Well, what happened in what it's in our little items,"
1908.0,1909.0, our newsboard items.
1909.0,1910.0, So you're jumping.
1910.0,1911.0," Yeah, what happened?"
1911.0,1913.0," Just since we're on that topic, what happened with that?"
1913.0,1914.0, Shut up.
1914.0,1915.0, Yes.
1915.0,1917.0," I don't know about just I won't talk about it, but, but check it out."
1917.0,1918.0, Downloads on file front.
1918.0,1919.0, It's a point of existence.
1919.0,1921.0," Yeah, it's a cool mind for Battlefield 2."
1921.0,1923.0," If you like that sort of thing, but you're tired of."
1923.0,1925.0," If you want, I don't know."
1925.0,1929.0, I think more more accuracy in the infantry engagements and a number of cool.
1929.0,1933.0, Introductions that they have like TV guided missiles on.
1933.0,1935.0, Personnel carriers and stuff.
1935.0,1936.0, Fun game.
1936.0,1937.0, You recommend that.
1937.0,1938.0, I've never had a field 21.40.
1938.0,1939.0, Yeah.
1939.0,1940.0, So much better.
1940.0,1941.0, I got them both at the same time.
1941.0,1944.0, And all I want to play is point of existence over.
1944.0,1947.0," I mean, some frustration comes with it."
1947.0,1952.0," So the caveat that if you, you have to be ready to accept like in."
1952.0,1957.0," I forget the name, but a more strategic, you know, realistic sort of."
1957.0,1961.0," Yeah, put that in quotes sort of shooter like if you're infantry and you're fighting tanks,"
1961.0,1966.0, just expect to lose and don't get mad instead just spawn in your main base and get a tank or just pick an infantry map.
1966.0,1968.0, But between the two.
1968.0,1972.0," Yeah, it's like point of existence is so much more satisfying than 21.42."
1972.0,1977.0," So when we're free to talk about 21.42, we're going to have to sit here and discuss like if there were what went wrong."
1977.0,1978.0, Right.
1978.0,1981.0, But it's just that was a company with a great track record.
1981.0,1982.0, Yeah.
1982.0,1985.0," Well, it's kind of interesting though when I think back to when Battlefield Vietnam came out,"
1985.0,1987.0, like I know I prefer playing desert combat.
1987.0,1988.0," Yeah, I did."
1988.0,1991.0," Yeah, this is just like a lot being better than the liberation."
1991.0,1992.0, Yeah.
1992.0,1996.0," So maybe you just get the way to Battlefield 3 for them, you know, make good catch up with it."
1996.0,1997.0, Yeah.
1997.0,1998.0, Okay.
1998.0,2003.0, So we can move on to a news items of the weekend and those are one I was just mentioning.
2003.0,2004.0," Well, Jeff, you want to go for it?"
2004.0,2006.0," No, no, no, you take it there. That's your job."
2006.0,2007.0, Yeah.
2007.0,2009.0, My job is just a sit here.
2009.0,2011.0, Okay.
2011.0,2016.0, So apparently the death in taxes guild just about finished with all the current all the current content
2016.0,2017.0, and World Warcraft.
2017.0,2021.0, And so you might tell me what the pronunciation and some of this stuff guys.
2021.0,2023.0, The next rummass.
2023.0,2025.0, It's Kel Thuzad.
2025.0,2026.0, Yeah.
2026.0,2027.0, It's not that much.
2027.0,2028.0, It's nice.
2028.0,2029.0," Okay. Well, no, look at that."
2029.0,2030.0, It's like a click.
2030.0,2032.0, It uses a clicking like it's a count.
2032.0,2033.0, It's not a monster.
2033.0,2035.0," No, that's not the African click."
2035.0,2036.0, Yeah.
2036.0,2037.0, If he's not Don Bay.
2037.0,2038.0," The cool, the Kelahari."
2038.0,2040.0, Anyway.
2040.0,2043.0, So this is so early at the bottom of the sum Uber Dungeon.
2043.0,2044.0, There's a final boss.
2044.0,2045.0, That's Mark's promise.
2045.0,2046.0, And yeah.
2046.0,2047.0, Thank you.
2047.0,2048.0, And the final boss.
2048.0,2049.0, Two X's though for double X.
2049.0,2050.0, Yeah.
2050.0,2051.0, Two X's.
2051.0,2052.0, It's rib.
2052.0,2053.0, Anyway.
2053.0,2055.0," So however, after attempting the,"
2055.0,2056.0," The big boss battle, the guy disappeared."
2056.0,2058.0, The boss just disappeared.
2058.0,2061.0, Did he ever show up or was he just not there?
2061.0,2065.0, It sounds like he was there and then glitched out of existence.
2065.0,2067.0, It was there.
2067.0,2068.0, It was there and then de-spawn.
2068.0,2074.0, I think the reason this is a big deal is that this would be something that had taken many people.
2074.0,2075.0," Many, many, many, many."
2075.0,2076.0, Yeah.
2076.0,2077.0, Yeah.
2077.0,2078.0, Mon's totally out of the house.
2078.0,2079.0, To be a reading this shit.
2079.0,2081.0, I see Kel Thuzad knocks for omnis.
2081.0,2082.0, And they found a bug.
2082.0,2083.0, And I'm like some.
2083.0,2084.0, Yeah.
2084.0,2087.0," The next news item is someone's playing just cause and you know, I went up to this building."
2087.0,2089.0, And it looked like my gun was inside the building.
2089.0,2091.0, But I could shoot inside the building.
2091.0,2092.0, Right.
2092.0,2093.0, It isn't like that kind of news.
2093.0,2098.0, It's like people working for months to get to a certain goal and they get to the end boss.
2098.0,2099.0, And then he's not there.
2099.0,2100.0, Yeah.
2100.0,2101.0, What's a figure part?
2101.0,2103.0," He is there and then just goes,"
2103.0,2104.0, Poof.
2104.0,2105.0, Yeah.
2105.0,2106.0, I'm not entirely out of the way.
2106.0,2108.0," So what I want to know is, you know, because we have a quote here from,"
2109.0,2110.0," What it was up on,"
2110.0,2112.0," Those are website,"
2112.0,2113.0," uh,"
2113.0,2114.0," uh,"
2114.0,2115.0, What is it say?
2115.0,2118.0," Uh, all those blizzard is working on finding the bug that D.S.B."
2118.0,2119.0," KELFASAD,"
2119.0,2120.0," um,"
2120.0,2121.0," according to the,"
2121.0,2122.0," to the, to the GELFASAD website."
2122.0,2124.0," KELFASAD did an up-re-spawning,"
2124.0,2126.0, but the source of the problem means unknown.
2126.0,2128.0," So, so they did get him eventually."
2128.0,2129.0, Right.
2129.0,2130.0, Or did they?
2130.0,2132.0," Well, they probably fought him with the beat him."
2132.0,2134.0, Usually these kind of things.
2134.0,2135.0, Like it's like a mountain.
2135.0,2136.0, So they could beat on him.
2136.0,2138.0," What's once they get to like a final boss,"
2138.0,2140.0," you'll, you won't hear about anyone beating it for like a month or two."
2140.0,2142.0, So they're a little doing a push on their finger.
2142.0,2144.0," Because it's a big coordinated effort,"
2144.0,2147.0, or like you just have to like figure out what your 40 people
2147.0,2149.0, really need to be doing exactly.
2149.0,2150.0, So some magical door to go.
2150.0,2152.0," So why it takes a long to get to this guy and why,"
2152.0,2153.0," you know,"
2153.0,2156.0, no one's got to him to figure out that he had these bonds after you.
2156.0,2158.0, And I'll be getting some good loot for that guy.
2158.0,2160.0," Yeah, I sure hope some GM comes back out with a talent."
2160.0,2161.0," What it is, is this,"
2161.0,2162.0," uh,"
2162.0,2163.0," death and taxes are role playing guild,"
2163.0,2165.0, because that would be rad to see the chat logs and how they
2165.0,2168.0, dealt with that kind of dude behind the curtain scenario.
2168.0,2169.0, Exactly.
2169.0,2172.0," Because any of the makeups rationalize some,"
2172.0,2174.0, I don't think they exist.
2174.0,2175.0," Oh yeah, they do."
2175.0,2177.0, Not not rating guilds.
2177.0,2179.0, I don't think I got this on the arm.
2179.0,2181.0," I think rating is such like a,"
2181.0,2183.0, it's almost like being in the army.
2183.0,2184.0," Like everyone,"
2184.0,2187.0, you have to talk about such game mechanics stuff while you're doing it.
2187.0,2189.0, That it is totally would break any immersion.
2189.0,2190.0, So there's not time to say.
2190.0,2192.0," Kelps this ad, it was a day to ask stuff."
2192.0,2195.0, You know who else compared rating to being like an army?
2195.0,2198.0, Was that that that that dive is dude that we were just quoting.
2198.0,2199.0," He said, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
2199.0,2200.0," as those,"
2200.0,2202.0," well, there's Bobby some truth to that there, huh?"
2202.0,2203.0, Yeah.
2203.0,2206.0," Wait, I wonder how that army sounds on the RPC servers."
2206.0,2207.0," I got, I'm just, I'm just dying to know."
2207.0,2208.0, What?
2208.0,2211.0," It's just here that they, they claimed on their forums that Kelps"
2211.0,2213.0," are not led to the guild,"
2213.0,2214.0, today we're role playing.
2214.0,2215.0," Yeah, they were."
2215.0,2217.0," Oh, they're all over the United States."
2217.0,2218.0, He fled.
2218.0,2219.0, You're for that to before us.
2220.0,2222.0," All right, no, no, no, no."
2222.0,2224.0," So, uh, all right, Darren,"
2224.0,2226.0, just move on to the carry on.
2226.0,2227.0, Carry on.
2227.0,2228.0," All right, we'll take it back to the top."
2228.0,2230.0, Talk to us on deserves no more in five minutes.
2230.0,2231.0, Exactly. He's done.
2231.0,2232.0, He dearest.
2232.0,2234.0, A lifetime to find.
2234.0,2236.0," All right, so last week we had a quick,"
2236.0,2240.0," a quick, a leak about the pricing from Windows Vista"
2240.0,2243.0, was on Amazon's Canadian page.
2243.0,2246.0, And it turns out the pricing wasn't that far off from what it is officially.
2246.0,2248.0, So I'll just run it down quick.
2248.0,2249.0, So we can get past it.
2249.0,2254.0," Windows Vista home basic, which is basically just the bare bones essence is 200 bucks."
2254.0,2256.0, Upgrad it from XP is 100.
2256.0,2260.0," Now let me interrupt you right away when we say, you know, bare bones basic."
2260.0,2262.0," I mean, we don't really know exactly yet what you said."
2262.0,2263.0," Well, it's a component sort, right?"
2263.0,2265.0," So they're saying, but I mean, we know it's had."
2265.0,2268.0," I'm guessing wordpad and like, you know,"
2268.0,2271.0," I mean, wordpad and mind sleeper and the ability to boot your computer."
2271.0,2273.0, That's probably going to be it.
2273.0,2274.0, Right.
2274.0,2276.0," And then it's kind of curious because it says like the,"
2276.0,2280.0," the Windows Vista home premium, which is probably what everyone's going to want to get."
2280.0,2285.0, Full packages to 39 upgrade 150 units is all the gaming multimedia internet stuff is there.
2285.0,2287.0, So let's get exactly right.
2287.0,2290.0, I'm wondering what the hell is it that they're having in this premium package.
2290.0,2291.0, It's not multimedia.
2291.0,2292.0," You get paid multi, yeah."
2292.0,2294.0," So it's multi-median internet, which means it's right."
2294.0,2296.0, So hearts online.
2296.0,2297.0, Holy crap.
2297.0,2301.0, So they're telling me that like the basic computing doesn't even include the internet.
2301.0,2303.0, Doesn't it kind of like the internet like a game.
2303.0,2306.0," Basically, basically competing you get a dust prompt."
2306.0,2307.0, Yeah.
2307.0,2308.0, Yeah.
2308.0,2309.0," When the wind is a pressure,"
2309.0,2311.0, the pressure can basically version yet cheap skate and
2311.0,2315.0," premium gaming multimedia internet, which means you get mind sweeper,"
2315.0,2317.0, paint and I.

2320.0,2322.0, 11 probably.
2322.0,2323.0, Okay.
2323.0,2324.0, Then there's the business addition.
2324.0,2325.0," Well, I look at ours."
2325.0,2329.0, The main ultimate ultimate addition is basically everything.
2329.0,2332.0, And that's a mere $400 for the full package or an upgrade is 259.
2332.0,2336.0," Well, I wonder if they're going to get office bundle."
2336.0,2337.0, They demo better for that much.
2337.0,2338.0, $1 dollars is a lot.
2338.0,2339.0, That's all.
2339.0,2341.0, A lot of them money right there.
2341.0,2342.0, All right.
2342.0,2345.0, So I think you just get past that.
2345.0,2347.0, So save your panties now.
2347.0,2348.0, Exactly.
2348.0,2349.0, For Windows Vista.
2349.0,2353.0, And the thing that kind of scares me is how much that's going to impact the cost of a new computer.
2353.0,2357.0," Because obviously, when they buy a license, you know, an version of this,"
2357.0,2359.0," you know, OS for a new computer."
2360.0,2362.0, When did what year did XP come out?
2362.0,2364.0, Let's do we remember?
2364.0,2366.0, How long since 2002?
2366.0,2367.0, Yeah.
2367.0,2371.0, Okay. So it's actually been a while since we've been forced upgrading our operating system.
2371.0,2373.0, Not to be in a poll just for Microsoft.
2373.0,2377.0," But I mean, this seems about right years wise, doesn't it?"
2377.0,2380.0," Well, there's $1.958.28."
2380.0,2381.0," $2,000."
2381.0,2382.0, Yeah.
2382.0,2384.0, So it's been.
2384.0,2386.0, Though I'm definitely going to have to be convinced.
2386.0,2387.0, That's great.
2387.0,2389.0," Well, not going to be an early adopter."
2389.0,2390.0," Well, I mean, they say that right now."
2390.0,2391.0, Yeah.
2391.0,2394.0, They really need to get to show what the LDX tends to do right off the bat.
2394.0,2397.0," You know, not to like, you know, jump topics too much."
2397.0,2400.0, But I don't know if Hello 2 is going to do it.
2400.0,2401.0, Wow.

2417.0,2418.0, I was a proper copy.

2422.0,2424.0, They want to keep dancing that show.
2424.0,2429.0," Anyway, so the guys behind that are actually putting together, I guess, partnering with"
2429.0,2435.0," AOL properties and then making a reality web game, or as they're calling it, a game log, or a"
2435.0,2436.0, a log.

2437.0,2438.0, God.
2438.0,2439.0," Oh, we needed."
2439.0,2441.0, OMG.

2493.0,2494.0, It's like this is a story.
2494.0,2495.0, Right.
2495.0,2496.0, You got to search.
2496.0,2497.0, Yeah.
2497.0,2498.0, Right.
2498.0,2500.0, He says hide boxes.

2503.0,2504.0, This is an anything new at all.
2504.0,2508.0," I mean, you can go to any, I was looking at Frieda Lays website the other day."
2508.0,2510.0, If I don't know why.
2510.0,2515.0," And like every single Frieda Lays, you know, product like Doritos has his own page."
2515.0,2517.0, But then there's like Doritos games.
2517.0,2518.0, Yeah.
2518.0,2520.0, Click on the Nacho cheese Doritos.

2525.0,2526.0, What if she's playing it for a while?
2526.0,2527.0, I don't know.
2527.0,2528.0, She's into it though.
2528.0,2530.0, Because it's like it mixes trivia with like geography.
2530.0,2531.0, That might be a fireable.
2531.0,2533.0, Like you have to like see it at all around.
2533.0,2537.0, You have to skip around like the map of the country finding the spoon.
2537.0,2540.0, Then you've got to answer like it gives you hints as to where it's at.
2540.0,2542.0," Like no, this location, whatever."
2542.0,2543.0, So it's like.
2543.0,2544.0, It's like.
2544.0,2545.0, It's like.
2545.0,2546.0, Yeah.
2546.0,2548.0, He has access to the entire library of PC gaming because if you know.
2548.0,2550.0, And now she's playing a game on a basket in every place.
2550.0,2551.0, I'm not going to.
2551.0,2552.0, I'm not going to.
2552.0,2553.0, For the.
2553.0,2556.0, It's a shameless play.
2556.0,2559.0, But the only thing that is even remotely redeemable is that you actually are competing.
2559.0,2561.0," So I mean, that's it."
2561.0,2566.0, Here's the last line up for grabs are millions of dollars a gold hitting in plain sight.
2566.0,2567.0, Plain sight.
2567.0,2568.0," Oh, it's in his properties."
2568.0,2569.0, Exactly.
2569.0,2571.0," You know, why would you say millions of dollars of gold?"
2571.0,2573.0, I should have been a pale and gold bullion.
2573.0,2575.0, I'm going to read a backhoe and uprooted this vlog.
2575.0,2577.0," No, where the gold's at."
2577.0,2578.0, I'm going to get my vote.
2578.0,2579.0, Yeah.
2579.0,2580.0," Oh, Sean."
2580.0,2581.0, Sean the light's excited.
2581.0,2582.0, Different for core craft gold.
2582.0,2583.0, Yeah.
2583.0,2584.0, So.
2584.0,2588.0," I mean, it's interesting that somebody is big as the amazing rakes folks are getting involved."
2588.0,2591.0," But basically, this is just our basic game."
2591.0,2597.0, Look at clip and cue bonds and all that stuff is like you just got a work harder for that.
2597.0,2601.0, It's like the bird and the little seed drops out when it does something.
2601.0,2603.0, You just got work harder for that seed now.
2603.0,2604.0, What do you feel stupid playing this thing?
2604.0,2607.0, Those things like publishers clearing outs or something.
2607.0,2608.0, Yeah.
2608.0,2609.0," It's like, you know, it's all the other things."
2609.0,2615.0," It's like, everyone's doing this."
2615.0,2617.0," I mean, like, lost it at this summer."
2617.0,2618.0, Right.
2618.0,2619.0, That doesn't have to be different.
2619.0,2620.0, That pushes the storyline.
2620.0,2623.0," But I'm just saying, yeah, it's going to be like, I mean, that's what it did."
2623.0,2626.0, Because that was like you released involved in the in the.
2626.0,2630.0, He chose the fall of dude out of machete explain how there were fireworks on the plane.
2630.0,2631.0, Okay.
2631.0,2632.0, We're going to do it.
2632.0,2633.0, We're going to do it.
2633.0,2634.0, Where we're disney.
2634.0,2635.0, All right.
2635.0,2636.0, Did you guys see the battle start galactic of web.
2636.0,2637.0, So it's by the way.
2637.0,2638.0," Oh, yeah."
2638.0,2639.0, Night.
2639.0,2640.0, I was kind of cool.
2640.0,2641.0, Turn it on quickly.
2641.0,2642.0, What was this?
2642.0,2646.0," Well, Balsar galactic other while they're waiting for season three to start on the battle start galactic or the sci-fi."
2646.0,2651.0, Or the sci-fi channel website sci-fi.com that actually brought casting every Tuesday and Thursday.
2651.0,2657.0," These four minute episodes of, you know, they look like they are like cutting them floor out tanks or something."
2657.0,2658.0, Right.
2658.0,2659.0," Just like a little budget film stalker, whatever."
2659.0,2663.0, But it's actually with some of the main actors from the series in it.
2663.0,2667.0, Little things sort of like it's supposed to be what's happening in between seasons two and three.
2667.0,2672.0," Which I just think it's kind of a neat development in TV history, right?"
2672.0,2674.0, That there's even the ability to do this.
2674.0,2679.0," I mean, ten years ago, we kind of imagined waiting in between seasons of a TV show we liked."
2679.0,2682.0, And they're able to watch little free episodes of that show on the web.
2682.0,2690.0," They're killing two birds with one stone by providing their DVD extras in advance, getting those knocked out for when the season three box set comes out."
2690.0,2691.0, Right.
2691.0,2692.0, Throw them together on there.
2692.0,2693.0," Anyway, I'm sorry."
2693.0,2694.0, That was a random tangent.
2694.0,2695.0, Not even related to gaming.
2695.0,2698.0, I just kind of got geeked out about battle strad the summer.
2698.0,2699.0, Battle strad the web.
2699.0,2700.0, Battle strad the web.
2700.0,2701.0, Yeah.
2701.0,2703.0," That probably is a battle story game on their side, isn't that?"
2703.0,2706.0, And you mentioned there somewhere in an email this week about it.
2706.0,2708.0," Well, there was some sort of email."
2708.0,2711.0," There I actually, I've been checking with a vent either."
2711.0,2713.0," There's not much news yet, but there was word of, of,"
2713.0,2716.0, Investor relations document that kind of slipped out there.
2716.0,2717.0, People just kind of stumbled upon.
2717.0,2722.0," And in it, they mentioned some of the upcoming, eventy games and one of them was a battle start galactic game."
2722.0,2731.0," So, no word yet as far as exactly what it is, could be just a super little, you know, thing on Xbox live arcade or it could be like a real full fledged thing."
2731.0,2732.0, Yeah.
2732.0,2737.0," In the meantime, there's plenty of mods with the new battle start ships and stuff and on battlefield stuff."
2737.0,2740.0," Some of the, what is it?"
2740.0,2743.0, Was this space game that was really stone steam a while ago?
2743.0,2744.0, It's been a while.
2744.0,2745.0," Ex-2, yeah."
2745.0,2746.0, There's like a...
2746.0,2747.0," Or X3, right?"
2747.0,2748.0," X3, yeah."
2748.0,2750.0, You can get a sign-on ship and libraries.
2750.0,2751.0, Cool.
2751.0,2752.0, All right.
2752.0,2753.0," You know, just jumping on?"
2753.0,2754.0, Yeah.
2754.0,2755.0, Move on there.
2755.0,2760.0," So according to the, so the 10 best selling games as listed for, okay, according to the MPD group, they"
2760.0,2764.0, top selling piece of games for ending the week of August 26th.
2764.0,2768.0," So, Madden and I follow seven obviously, you know, huge."
2768.0,2770.0," Number two, World of Warcraft still."
2770.0,2771.0, I'm fine.
2771.0,2773.0, That really makes sense too.
2773.0,2776.0," Number three, rollercoaster take who and three gold."
2776.0,2779.0," Now, here's the one, I'm gonna, here's where it's getting into wacky territory."
2779.0,2780.0, Okay.
2780.0,2781.0," So the number, was it?"
2781.0,2782.0, Was it this number?
2782.0,2784.0, The number five top selling game?
2784.0,2785.0, Ryan?
2785.0,2786.0," Your favorite game, right?"
2786.0,2787.0, Ryan?
2787.0,2788.0, Ryan?
2788.0,2789.0, Yeah.
2789.0,2792.0, When it's time to change.
2792.0,2796.0," Nancy Drew, danger by design by her interactive."
2796.0,2799.0," Yeah, that kind of threw me throw a screw."
2799.0,2800.0, Danger by design.
2800.0,2801.0, And let's do it.
2801.0,2807.0," So we point out what, what did it make the list while Nancy Drew danger by design did make it."
2807.0,2808.0, Pray.
2808.0,2810.0, Not on here.
2810.0,2811.0, Rise of the ledge.
2811.0,2813.0, Rise of the ledge isn't not on here.
2813.0,2814.0, Tight and quick.
2814.0,2815.0, Tight and quick.
2815.0,2816.0, Tight and quick.
2816.0,2817.0, Not on here.
2817.0,2818.0, You're a figure that game would get.
2818.0,2820.0, But Nancy Drew danger by design.
2820.0,2823.0," It's cars, THQ cars make so to few lists."
2823.0,2825.0," So who, where did that come from?"
2825.0,2826.0, What's the warm car?
2826.0,2828.0, I'm betting that's a Walmart crowd.
2828.0,2829.0, And look at it.
2829.0,2832.0," You got, you got Madden, which nobody buys on the PC."
2832.0,2833.0," I, yeah."
2833.0,2834.0, I see I find that surprising.
2834.0,2837.0, Except for everybody who bought it who made it the number one best selling PC game.
2837.0,2839.0, Nobody buys Madden on the PC.
2839.0,2842.0, I found that very surprising that Madden was the number one PC.
2842.0,2845.0," You know everybody's buying it from the, that's what we're doing at PC."
2845.0,2846.0," It's the, yeah."
2846.0,2847.0, After it's number one.
2847.0,2849.0, We didn't help it.
2849.0,2850.0, It's number one.
2850.0,2856.0," You got Sims 2, which, well, as he pointed out to me, that's a little different."
2856.0,2858.0," But it's, games like Sims 2."
2858.0,2860.0," I mean, that's just like evergreen."
2860.0,2862.0, I imagine it's always going to be there.
2862.0,2866.0, I imagine that's probably something that sells to actually watch those kind of stories.
2866.0,2869.0," So I'm going to point out actually, two Sims 2 things are on that list."
2869.0,2874.0," So Sims 2 is like high up there and then number 6 is, when they're open for business,"
2875.0,2876.0, expansion.
2876.0,2877.0, It's too early for pets.
2877.0,2879.0," It is too early for pets, pets is enough yet officially."
2879.0,2880.0, It's still surprising.
2880.0,2883.0, It's a cool that Sims 4 is still on there.
2883.0,2884.0," Yes, that's all."
2884.0,2885.0, That's all.
2885.0,2887.0, It's such an extraordinary complex game.
2887.0,2888.0, And that's good.
2888.0,2894.0," Sims 4 actually has, you know, it, it, it sort of in its, in its quiet way, has, is very mainstream."
2894.0,2899.0," You know, it doesn't get a lot of play, but it, but it's a really solid big hit."
2899.0,2901.0, It's only as complex as you want to make it.
2901.0,2903.0," I mean, I love that game."
2904.0,2908.0," And yeah, interestingly enough battle of war, or a craft three is on the list."
2908.0,2911.0, Or craft three battle to the claddle to.
2911.0,2914.0," I mean, because I don't think that offers anything new there, right?"
2914.0,2915.0, Let's be there for a while.
2915.0,2917.0," I mean, it's not like, yeah."
2917.0,2920.0," A lot of, I mean, what about the computers that are playing these two?"
2920.0,2921.0," I mean, that's another thing."
2921.0,2924.0," You know, what, maybe a craft three is just coming from like,"
2924.0,2926.0, World of Warcraft fans who are like now on a screen.
2926.0,2927.0, Discovering.
2927.0,2928.0, Yeah.
2928.0,2929.0, The game's going here.
2929.0,2932.0," Like, such an elder scrolls are really demanding on your PC."
2933.0,2934.0, So there's a lot right there.
2934.0,2935.0, Yeah.
2935.0,2940.0," I gotta say that the Nancy Drew thing is, I mean, it's easy for us to make fun of something like that."
2940.0,2942.0, But it's actually kind of cool in a way.
2942.0,2944.0, I think that a game like that is on here.
2944.0,2953.0," You know, a game that is appealing to, you know, girls is something that this industry gets criticized a lot about for not doing."
2953.0,2957.0," No, so the fact, well, maybe the game sucks for that, so then it's not good."
2957.0,2958.0, I don't know.
2958.0,2961.0," I mean, that when it's like, I mean, you've got both sexes buying, uh,"
2961.0,2964.0," uh, syphor buying sims buying warcraft, uh,"
2964.0,2967.0, good point actually buying roller coaster tycoon.
2967.0,2968.0," Oh, that's the other thing."
2968.0,2974.0," Aside from being relatively easy to handle on the PC, these are widely actually your kind of gender game."
2974.0,2975.0, That's a good point.
2975.0,2977.0, So I've done corrected.
2977.0,2978.0, You're right.
2978.0,2979.0, This is a top 10 list of games.
2979.0,2983.0, So the one very wide people to gender stereotypes appears.
2983.0,2984.0, And I don't know.
2984.0,2985.0, Okay.
2985.0,2986.0, You're right.
2986.0,2987.0, Who knows.
2987.0,2988.0, She's a detective sexist.
2988.0,2989.0," Yes, she's a detective."
2989.0,2991.0," Yeah, so that's, that's not a tradition."
2991.0,2992.0, You're a detective.
2992.0,2993.0, You know what?
2993.0,2995.0, You have to take this Nancy Drew.
2995.0,2998.0, I don't like where that's going.
2998.0,3002.0, It's going to turn into an IGN preview of a dead or live.
3002.0,3005.0," That's, let's let's X-ray."
3005.0,3007.0, We can talk about it.
3007.0,3008.0, It's not going to be on the list.
3008.0,3012.0," There's a, there's a text and it's talking about how the children are sexy."
3012.0,3015.0," And it, we found it made me crazy."
3016.0,3018.0, Much like you're detecting a net of Drew stuff.
3018.0,3019.0, Pettarastial.
3019.0,3020.0, Game for the whole family.
3020.0,3022.0, Okay.
3022.0,3025.0, And it's a little bit of a split beyond this.
3025.0,3026.0," Please, let's go."
3026.0,3028.0, We're offending everybody this week.
3028.0,3029.0, I feel like we're offending.
3029.0,3031.0, Please don't offend the pettarests.
3031.0,3034.0, C'mon.
3034.0,3035.0, C'mon.
3035.0,3037.0, C'mon audience.
3037.0,3039.0, Sorry.
3039.0,3040.0, Sorry everybody.
3041.0,3047.0," We'll think about, like you, you, you, we're talking about the stars that David on the sleeves and the context of the other game."
3047.0,3052.0," It's, it's out of bounds when I'm talking about something that someone else wrote on the internet."
3052.0,3054.0," So the internet, man."
3054.0,3055.0, You're right.
3055.0,3056.0, It's on the internet.
3056.0,3057.0, Public access.
3057.0,3058.0, Yeah.
3058.0,3060.0, What's up next?
3060.0,3061.0, Mr. Gladstone.
3061.0,3063.0," All right. Well, how are we doing on time?"
3063.0,3065.0, We've probably even talked for two hours.
3065.0,3066.0, Fifty minutes.
3066.0,3067.0, Okay.
3067.0,3068.0, All right. So how we could skip ahead.
3068.0,3069.0, Go to.
3069.0,3070.0, James convention.
3070.0,3072.0, Yeah. Let's do that. Let's talk about that.
3072.0,3073.0, Let's get back on the German tip.
3073.0,3074.0, Let's go.
3074.0,3075.0, That's right. Yeah.
3075.0,3078.0, Bring it on. On a high positive turn.
3078.0,3079.0," No, it's their hope."
3079.0,3080.0, I was going to start.
3080.0,3081.0, This German games convention.
3081.0,3082.0, There we go.
3082.0,3083.0," Okay. So according to the game industry,"
3083.0,3087.0," that is Mark Rain, the cop who did the Hewdie cop over at Epic Games,"
3087.0,3090.0," came away with this impression of game,"
3090.0,3092.0, Leipzig games convention.
3092.0,3096.0, This show will replace E3 as the world's premier gaming show case venue.
3097.0,3100.0, Basically he says that it illustrates exactly what was wrong with E3.
3100.0,3101.0, It's a great show.
3101.0,3103.0, It's open to the public.
3103.0,3107.0, And I can never understand why they wouldn't open E3 to the public.
3107.0,3108.0," And he goes on to say,"
3108.0,3111.0," I bet if you if they had done it the way Leipzig does there,"
3111.0,3114.0, they would there would still be an E3 and it would be just as important to people.
3114.0,3116.0," I mean, I mean, it makes sense."
3116.0,3118.0," I mean, if you after all that time,"
3118.0,3120.0," people were, you know, companies like EA were blowing millions of"
3120.0,3123.0," millions of dollars and they had nothing really to show for it,"
3123.0,3124.0, except for a couple of reporters opinions.
3125.0,3128.0, We're sort of like the Penny Arcade Expo that recently happened
3128.0,3131.0," in over in, yeah, in Washington because, you know,"
3131.0,3133.0, that was also open to the public as well.
3133.0,3137.0, And it opened E3 to the public for as long as I've been going there.
3137.0,3140.0," Well, no, they do have these artificial barriers that put on it."
3140.0,3143.0," I mean, like you have to have some kind of in-game industry credentials."
3143.0,3146.0," I mean, granted, you get in because you were working at EB at the time,"
3146.0,3147.0," so you kind of finnailed it, right?"
3147.0,3149.0, Is that pretty much where a couple of years I was working with?
3149.0,3152.0," Yeah, but like it was basically like it was still a leading process."
3152.0,3154.0," I mean, granted, it was still really crap."
3154.0,3157.0, You had to sell 50 pre-orders of what is this grip?
3157.0,3159.0, That's a dream to get in.
3159.0,3161.0," I mean, I've seen like little kids walking around."
3161.0,3164.0," I mean, I was one of the girls."
3164.0,3165.0, I was one of the girls.
3165.0,3166.0, Get out of my way.
3166.0,3167.0, I'm late for an appointment.
3167.0,3170.0, But that's the thing is if it became a show for the public
3170.0,3172.0," without officially being for the public, I mean."
3172.0,3173.0," Well, that was the thing."
3173.0,3177.0," It was, it was a show for the public without actually letting the whole public"
3177.0,3178.0, in it just right.
3178.0,3179.0, It's just a lame line.
3179.0,3181.0," And I think, I don't think that would have fixed it at least"
3181.0,3183.0, made it easier for us to navigate.
3183.0,3186.0, It was just to have like a pre-pressed day or two where it's just for three
3186.0,3190.0, or three or just the show floor and like the volume turned down
3190.0,3192.0, and we're just walking around doing your thing.
3192.0,3193.0, Yeah.
3193.0,3196.0, So it was leaps of really the one that's going to feed the new E3
3196.0,3199.0, or it was just being said because it happens to be one of the two that happened
3199.0,3200.0, right after the two.
3200.0,3203.0," Well, I think it is a pretty big one, but also, I mean, with something to keep"
3203.0,3207.0, mind is that the release for the PC market is a huge in Germany.
3208.0,3211.0," It's more so than hearing that you listen sometimes, I think."
3211.0,3212.0, I think so.
3212.0,3214.0, I'm going to give you a huge idea.
3214.0,3215.0, Yeah.
3215.0,3217.0," So I mean, therefore we take back every nasty thing we said about the Germans"
3217.0,3219.0, early in the podcast.
3219.0,3220.0," Hey, you said even piece of gaming."
3220.0,3222.0," We love you, brothers."
3222.0,3223.0, That's right.
3223.0,3224.0," Octon, baby."
3224.0,3226.0, So don't do that now.
3226.0,3227.0, You ruined it.
3227.0,3228.0, What?
3228.0,3229.0," You too, elbow."
3229.0,3230.0, Come on.
3230.0,3231.0, Oh yeah.
3231.0,3232.0, Okay.
3232.0,3233.0, You still ran that we went down.
3233.0,3234.0, Nervous.
3234.0,3236.0, It's what happens when you get old man.
3236.0,3237.0, You want to make it.
3237.0,3238.0, It's cruel.
3238.0,3239.0, Yeah.
3239.0,3240.0," Oh, the Nick."
3240.0,3241.0, Oh my god.
3241.0,3242.0," Darren, you can't say."
3242.0,3244.0, That means danger or something.
3244.0,3245.0, Attention.
3245.0,3246.0, Yeah.
3246.0,3247.0, Right.
3247.0,3251.0," Anyway, so there was one interesting point that Mark raised in his comments."
3251.0,3255.0, The only negative I could think of is that there's more of a German
3255.0,3257.0," thing than the show, but it's very hard to show."
3257.0,3259.0," But sure, a game is because of the rules that happened in the country."
3259.0,3260.0, Oh.
3260.0,3262.0," So like basically, they would be showing the game and it's emrated."
3262.0,3265.0," So anytime anyone under 18 was in the room, they had to shoot them out."
3265.0,3266.0, Right.
3266.0,3271.0," But if E3 had been open to the public that way, they would have had to do the same thing."
3271.0,3277.0," Well, I mean, I would like to think they would, but something tells me it's not as strictly enforced here as it is in Germany."
3277.0,3279.0, What's the attendance like?
3279.0,3280.0," Yeah, they would have dude."
3280.0,3283.0, Because think of like the rules on selling games based on their rating.
3283.0,3285.0," Yeah, but how well how tightly those in forging also will."
3285.0,3287.0," I mean, they were going to be all right."
3287.0,3290.0, Did see kids in E3.
3290.0,3294.0," I don't know how they got there because we both know that like when we get our freelancers in,"
3294.0,3298.0, we have to have like near their either their driver's license or births or
3298.0,3301.0," typically, or some equivalent to indicate that they're over 18."
3301.0,3302.0, I don't know how they got in.
3302.0,3303.0, Exactly.
3303.0,3305.0, The parents like threw them over the wall or something.
3305.0,3306.0, Right.
3306.0,3311.0, These kids get in and you'll walk around the show and it's not like there's like these blinders around each booth.
3311.0,3314.0," You'll walk past activation and there's you know, quite worth having a territory."
3314.0,3315.0, I didn't see any kids.
3315.0,3318.0," Now I think of, I've seen like people with pubes, dashes and stuff."
3318.0,3319.0, It has for kids.
3319.0,3322.0, But not like legitimate kids.
3322.0,3324.0," I'm like, you've stashed."
3324.0,3325.0, I know exactly.
3325.0,3327.0, I'm going to like me a minute at the parse.
3327.0,3330.0, You think like like a murketer self?
3330.0,3333.0," No, it's just like all like kind of."
3333.0,3334.0, But we know.
3334.0,3335.0, We get it now.
3335.0,3337.0, We have a stand out.
3337.0,3338.0, Everyone.
3338.0,3340.0, We don't want that.
3340.0,3342.0, That's definitely not five.
3342.0,3343.0, No more pubes.
3343.0,3346.0, There's my Jake have more.
3346.0,3348.0, I can't be as angry.
3348.0,3349.0," Well, I think they had a,"
3350.0,3352.0, like over a hundred thousand people show up this year.
3352.0,3354.0, But what was the attendance for E3?
3354.0,3355.0, I don't know.
3355.0,3356.0, That means a lot of people.
3356.0,3357.0, Yeah.
3357.0,3359.0," But and also you know what, I mean, quite honestly,"
3359.0,3361.0," like Europe's probably a little more central to, you know,"
3361.0,3364.0, if everyone to come there is opposed to everyone coming to the US for E3.
3364.0,3365.0, Just a thought.
3365.0,3366.0," Hi, excuse me."
3366.0,3367.0, We're the center of the universe.
3367.0,3368.0," Oh, right."
3368.0,3369.0, I keep forgetting that.
3369.0,3370.0, I keep forgetting that.
3370.0,3371.0, Sorry.
3371.0,3372.0, I don't know.
3372.0,3373.0, That's kind of where we're.
3373.0,3374.0, You set that because it's tough.
3374.0,3377.0," I mean, but I mean, like, from the east, they just they crossed the Pacific."
3377.0,3379.0, I think they're going to be a little bit more difficult.
3379.0,3381.0, I think they're going to be a little bit more difficult.
3381.0,3382.0, Okay.
3382.0,3383.0, Okay.
3383.0,3385.0, I'm not going to work either.
3385.0,3387.0, The earth is probably the best place.
3387.0,3388.0, The core of the earth is the base.
3388.0,3389.0, I'm awesome.
3389.0,3390.0, I'm going to say the space.
3390.0,3392.0," I think a little, maybe the mantle, maybe the upper cross."
3392.0,3394.0, All right.
3394.0,3395.0, That's it.
3395.0,3396.0, Let's just skip over to the questions.
3396.0,3397.0, We have time for questions.
3397.0,3398.0, Do we have time for questions?
3398.0,3399.0, Sure.
3399.0,3400.0, A couple of questions.
3400.0,3402.0," We need to get, this is for listeners."
3402.0,3403.0, Something we want.
3403.0,3404.0, So to hang in there.
3404.0,3405.0, We're going to mess happen.
3405.0,3406.0, We're going to get it.
3406.0,3407.0, We're going to get it.
3407.0,3409.0," And I want to get some of you, you know,"
3409.0,3411.0, play calling when you're in the middle of a game.
3411.0,3413.0, And let us hear some of that madness.
3413.0,3414.0," Jeff's like, I don't want to."
3414.0,3416.0, I'm going to make it.
3416.0,3418.0," But yeah, so we can really take."
3418.0,3421.0," Like, like, a middle like a wild raider something."
3421.0,3423.0," Yeah, I mean, we'll get, yeah, get some people in the middle."
3423.0,3427.0," Yeah, we'll talk to us and we can get some soundboards going so we can drop like."
3427.0,3429.0, The monster queue.
3429.0,3430.0," Like, all right."
3430.0,3435.0," Jeff, take me out with an ultra kill."
3435.0,3437.0, That's a good idea.
3437.0,3438.0, I'm for that.
3438.0,3440.0, Let's make it fun.
3440.0,3442.0, I'm going to soundboards for next time too.
3442.0,3444.0, I'll get the wave files out.
3444.0,3447.0," Okay, so I'm looking at the questions here."
3447.0,3448.0, Here's one.
3448.0,3451.0," I kind of like, terrace snugs Nelson."
3451.0,3455.0," Ask, you get constant offers of hey, join my Uber guild."
3455.0,3458.0, I'll power level you or things like that.
3458.0,3465.0, Have you ever had any weird or unsettling interactions with readers of CGW?
3465.0,3466.0, How much time we have?
3466.0,3470.0," If so, would you please tell your craziest story?"
3470.0,3473.0, Are you guys here when the guy actually showed up at our office here?
3473.0,3475.0," Because he was a fan of us, remember?"
3475.0,3476.0," Yeah, I think I was there for that."
3476.0,3479.0, And then he like wanted to sit in our editorial meeting.
3479.0,3480.0, Yeah.
3480.0,3483.0," Which was kind of, you know, like, oh, yeah."
3483.0,3486.0, I had something like that happened once.
3486.0,3487.0, It was way back.
3487.0,3488.0, I got a toast.
3488.0,3491.0, I think you're talking about a different guy.
3491.0,3492.0, Okay.
3492.0,3496.0, It was a similar like a fan came to the office because he was in the area.
3496.0,3502.0," I don't know if you were there, but I knew me and can in like Robert Ranton when the elevator."
3502.0,3503.0, Think you call security.
3503.0,3506.0," Now, we were like going down for lunch or something and did he like,"
3506.0,3508.0, Did he stop you guys and recognize you?
3508.0,3510.0," Hey, aren't you?"
3510.0,3512.0, Was it that kind of thing or something?
3512.0,3516.0, Maybe he had gone up to like reception and asked for us or something.
3516.0,3517.0, But it's good that we did.
3517.0,3518.0," Yeah, you think?"
3518.0,3521.0," I mean, I thought they would respect to the people who like us a lot."
3521.0,3524.0," I mean, certainly we were happy when people like us on like our magazine."
3524.0,3529.0, But I can't imagine going to someone's place of business to say hi.
3529.0,3530.0, Because I thought they were cool.
3530.0,3531.0," I mean, would you ever do that?"
3531.0,3532.0, Like a magazine you like?
3532.0,3538.0, Do you know about the classic one that happened on our same floor to another magazine in the game group?
3538.0,3544.0, Where the guy got in somehow and he goes over in the other offices of the other chief of electronic giving monthly any stands there.
3544.0,3551.0, He starts like box stepping like you like nervous like you know like speech 101 college class for the kids face just turns pale.
3551.0,3553.0, It looks like he could just fall over the word.
3553.0,3558.0, So like he put some paper on the desk with some like piece of crap like preview or something on it.
3558.0,3564.0," And then he starts saying like that from the M&M, my old things like if you only had one shot."
3564.0,3568.0, Would you take that? Would you take that shot? I don't know how it goes.
3568.0,3571.0, But just like stammering that nonsense out.
3571.0,3573.0," So, so, oh my god."
