0.0,5.2, This one-up podcast is brought to you by Games for Windows. Welcome to Better PC Gaming.
5.2,12.6, Created with the idea that gaming should deliver more. Games for Windows branded titles bring you all the fun of gaming without all the work.
12.6,20.6," And with the hottest titles around and Windows Vista compatibility, Games for Windows promises to deliver great new gaming experiences every time you play."
21.6,36.6, We out. We out. We out. We out. We out. We out. So we have anything left or we done. I'm kind of wasted. I think we're done. I'm not sure about this week's podcast. Yeah. We're better here too long.
36.6,44.6," We talk about too much stuff for it. Let's kill it. We have a kill it. Have you guys read Harry Potter yet? Yeah, are you any gonna read it? Hell no. No."
45.6,54.6, I'll read it. You're gonna read those baby books. I guess I'm gonna read those baby books. You know that she is written on that she's richer than the queen.
54.6,61.6, I'm not saying that's proof that she's great. But think it out of that. She's the world's she's no she's the richest woman in the United Kingdom.
61.6,66.6, That's richer than the queen's. You want me to get you some doctor suits after you're done. Also funny also they the.
68.6,70.6, Have you not read the Harry Potter books now?
71.6,83.6, The movies are okay. You see the movies and you have the books. The books are the good parts. So you okay. So you know the Harry Potter story. You've read I mean you've experienced Harry Potter universe.
83.6,95.6," But you've watched like the lame one and you're disson me because I read the books. He's like come on. He's like then tell the literary and he's like too busy reading impulse, which is a comic about flashes kid cousin."
95.6,100.6," To read about you are. Yeah, totally."
100.6,103.6, Make it fun to me. Glasses and everything.
103.6,106.6, What the hell both you got glass.
108.6,110.6, I got contacts.
110.6,111.6, Yeah. Yeah.
111.6,116.6, I'm pretty much wind. So you've got you've got your feet going on still.
116.6,119.6," Oh, you're talking about this."
120.6,124.6, Now that we're at the end. I just didn't want it to take up the whole first segment. Yeah. Yeah.
124.6,131.6," Yeah. Sure. Well, yeah. As we said at the beginning of the podcast, the."
131.6,132.6, The.
132.6,135.6, The.
135.6,136.6, The.
136.6,140.6, The.
140.6,144.6, The.
144.6,148.6, The.
148.6,153.6, The.
153.6,158.6, The.
158.6,160.6, Of course now making fun of the guy.
160.6,162.6, But it's true.
162.6,175.6, It's true. And there were some reasonable people that I talked to. There's some people who wanted to actually talk about fallout with me on the form and so that was the beginning of a sort of nice conversation going on with the couple of the guys throwing the quick cliffs notes.
175.6,178.6, So we're going to talk about the.
178.6,180.6, We're going to talk about the.
180.6,183.6, So we're going to talk about the.
183.6,201.6, And the hard core community who swears by fallout one and two saying there's no way in how that this is going to be a good game. Right. And so then that's what the war was right actually we podcasted about it about the community before we had actually even really seen.
201.6,202.6, And it was a.
202.6,220.6, And it was sort of put posted on on the fan side is like further proof that all game journalists are more on some assholes. You know.
220.6,223.6, Licking looking Bethesda balls.
223.6,226.6, Because that it was best dollar sign.
226.6,232.6," Yeah, yeah, it's like my spelling Microsoft, you know, if like a triple K in the."
232.6,233.6, Right.
233.6,243.6," And you know, I don't really feel like being defensive about it here, but you know, I did say later when I was talking with these guys, it's like look."
243.6,254.6, It's early and if something looks good in an early stage and we say that that doesn't mean we're validating everything that the company does and that is guaranteed to get a 10 out of 10 review the game.
254.6,273.6," Yes, the game could end up sucking whatever, but of course our default when we're looking at very early code if it does look okay or good or promising is to say that because what's the other side, right. It's like unfair to be a harshly critical of something that's not remotely done yet, right. No other art form does that."
273.6,276.6, And as great as we acknowledge that those original games are.
276.6,283.6," I mean, part of your argument was they think I mean, there's there's the chance that they're in shining their memory."
283.6,299.6," To such an extent that they're now, you know, oblivious to any false that might have been there. So when there's all the talk about well, these assholes that are making the game now have no sense of humor. They can't do the jokes. They can't pull off the sophisticated, you know, comedy that characterize the series and it's like we're pointing out."
299.6,305.6, There's some serious groaners in those games too that you might have changed those jokes.
305.6,314.6," Fallout 2 had a bunch of sort of like lame ass pop culture references that Fallout 1 didn't have that, you know, these games were not perfect."
314.6,319.6," Fallout 1, I don't know if it's in our Hall of Fame, is it? It might be. I can't remember."
319.6,325.6," But anyway, I actually reviewed it for a computer gaming role. When it first came out and I gave it, you know, an accent rating was a great game."
325.6,339.6," But they weren't perfect, like you're saying, the jokes weren't always all funny. There were things that were walking about the game. It's just a really odd thing that over time these things become, you know, canon. You just can't, you can't fuck with them, you know."
339.6,343.6," So anyway, why are we bringing all this up?"
343.6,346.6," Go. I said all that time, setting you up for the transition."
346.6,348.6, And then I fucked it up.
348.6,354.6," Okay. So that brings us to this point. What do you want? And not, and you posted, you are not a garnet."
354.6,361.6, I can't do it. I like it. So you posted that you personally found some issues with the weapons handling in the old game.
361.6,362.6, Right. I was.
362.6,363.6, That was in.
363.6,368.6," So what I was setting you up for saying that, hey, old games were looking at him with rose color glasses."
368.6,370.6, Right. Here's one reason why.
370.6,371.6, Here's another reason.
371.6,374.6," Okay. So I said, thank you."
374.6,380.6," So I said in the forum when I was saying that not everything was great. Guys in the old games, I wrote,"
380.6,386.6," Well, first, I will say that I personally found some of the weapons handling in the old games to be a little silly."
386.6,392.6," Like, I found my suspension of disbelief being challenged when I was missing shots from one foot away consistently."
392.6,398.6," Well, Jeff, I usually do not post here, but when I see our march like these, I just have to comment."
398.6,408.6," Now we will set the way back machine in the old West, October 26, 1881, the place, tombstone Arizona."
408.6,415.6," Now remember that the gun fight was fought in a vacant lot about 18 feet wide, but also in freemont street in front of the lot."
415.6,422.6, Most of the shooting was done at ranges of about 10 feet or less. The number of shots fired can only be estimated.
422.6,425.6, And estimates vary from 20 to 30 shots total.
425.6,432.6," Now, I must emphasize the closeness of the gun fight once again when I relay the various injuries below."
433.6,438.6," The herbs injuries, why it came out of the gun fight on Skate while Virgil was shot through the right calf."
438.6,442.6, Morgan was shot through the upper back above his shoulder blades by a single bullet.
442.6,446.6," And holiday was grazed on the hip, total hits, three."
446.6,451.6," Clent injuries, like Clinton Billy Clayborn ran through the middle of the fight in the Skate Don injured."
451.6,458.6," Frank McLeory was shot in the abdomen near the navel, early in the fight by Wyatt before he was failed at the end of the fight by pistol bullet."
458.6,463.6," Hitting at the base of his skull under his right ear, this shot fired by Morgan hurt."
463.6,466.6, Two mother fucking hits.
466.6,472.6, Tom McLeory already fatally wounded from a double shotgun blast was seen running a stumbling westward when
472.6,476.6," White shot him in the abdomen. Two shotgun, one pistol hit."
476.6,482.6, Billy Clayborn was shot through the wrist by Morgan in the right chest through the right lung by Morgan
483.6,493.6, through the right arm by Virgil in the abdomen under the 12th rib by Virgil in the hip by Wyatt in a graze across his scalp by Virgil six fucking hits.
493.6,497.6, Now you may be asking yourself WTF.
497.6,507.6, Well think about it. He's were nine men who were known as excellent shots and it ranges less than ten feet firing between 20 and 30 rounds and the only score 12 hits.
508.6,511.6," In fact, two ran right through the gunfight and were never touched."
511.6,517.6, Nine men who are known for their accuracy were going at each other guns blazing in this score less than 60 percent.
517.6,524.6, And if you use the higher total and take out minor grazes even less then you claim to be disillusioned by not hitting at close range.
524.6,529.6, Dude what the fuck is your problem with not hitting at close range.
529.6,533.6, I've seen more on fire pistol at a foot and miss.
533.6,537.6, They were that bad of a shot. So your statement is hilarious at the least.
537.6,541.6, Leave a Chris at the best and as far as I'm concerned they were too liberal with their hits.
541.6,544.6, You ever hear a saying that goes like this.
544.6,548.6, Sometimes the safest place is right in front of the person holding the weapon.
548.6,550.6, There's a reason for that saying.
550.6,552.6, So let me get this straight.
552.6,556.6, You think an FPS shooter is more realistic than an ISO TV game.
556.6,562.6," Man dude, I so hope you're not even trying to imply that for that would show just how little about gunplay."
562.6,564.6, You do know.
564.6,567.6, Try looking up some statistics for number around needed to be fired.
567.6,569.6, Discore a fatal hit sometime.
569.6,572.6, It may enlighten you before you make another comment like that.
572.6,576.6, Sometimes I think folks should smell what they're shoveling.
576.6,578.6, Shift rate rolling guys.
578.6,580.6, Shift rate cheers.
580.6,581.6, Thor Graham.
581.6,583.6, So here's Jeff.
583.6,587.6, First off I wanted to say just what bitch we've got the internet too and Wikipedia.
587.6,588.6, Right.
588.6,592.6, And we want to say that all scorpion species possess venom.
592.6,595.6," In general, scorpion venom is described as neurotoxic in nature."
595.6,600.6," One exception to this, however is the hemoscorpius lepturist, which possesses cytopoxic venom."
600.6,605.6," The neurotoxins consist of a variety of small proteins as well as sodium and potassium cations,"
605.6,608.6, which serve to interfere with the neurotransmission in the victim.
608.6,612.6, Scorpions use their venom to kill and paralyze their prey so it can be eaten.
612.6,615.6, In general it's fast acting allowing for effective prey capture.
615.6,623.6, And if you can't tell the difference between a scorpion's venom in an isotb game and an FPS.
623.6,625.6, The fuck you.
625.6,627.6, You need to get all Wikipedia.
627.6,628.6, Yeah.
628.6,629.6, Yeah.
629.6,634.6, I don't know what I didn't know how to respond to that post.
634.6,635.6, What are you saying?
635.6,636.6, I think we just did.
636.6,637.6, I think we just did.
637.6,638.6, Yeah.
638.6,641.6, I have PS is more realistic than a turn-based video game.
641.6,642.6," No, I'm not."
642.6,648.6, You say in a game with fucking goddamn ghouls that walk around their faces falling off and
648.6,651.6, talking like grunts and stuff is like totally fine.
651.6,654.6," But then when it comes to shooting your weapon and a turn-based or whatever,"
654.6,659.6, he's got to break out Google and give us the entire story of how the fucking west was won.
659.6,663.6," Then, then do we know that we have been owned?"
663.6,664.6, Yes.
664.6,665.6, Right.
665.6,666.6," So yeah, I just had to share that."
666.6,668.6," I mean, that's give me a break man."
668.6,671.6," I mean, that's the kind of shit that makes me hate the internet."
671.6,673.6," The fuck did you ever see you at the last place when you didn't have the internet, dude?"
673.6,674.6, I'm right.
674.6,675.6, It's fucking at the end of the movie.
675.6,677.6, It's a lot of people with the black Wikipedia from your browser.
677.6,678.6, Who me!
678.6,679.6," No, the guy wrote that."
679.6,680.6, You wrote that.
680.6,681.6," Oh, the guy wrote that."
681.6,682.6, Why did I do it over there?
682.6,683.6, Why did I do it over there?
683.6,685.6, Why did I do it over there?
685.6,686.6, Why did I do it over there?
686.6,687.6, Yeah.
687.6,689.6, What are you going to do?
689.6,690.6, Some people got a lot of time.
690.6,691.6, Cheers.
691.6,692.6, Cheers.
692.6,693.6, Through my touchscreen.
693.6,694.6, Cheers.
694.6,695.6, So there's that.
695.6,698.6, I'm sure we'll there'll be another round after this podcast now.
698.6,700.6, So we'll we get back on that.
700.6,703.6, 3 at all. So we're all arguing over fucking nothing.
703.6,706.6, No way. We're shown like 5% of the game.
706.6,708.6, Are you in for the present?
708.6,714.6, 1% that you should not assume that there's no way in hell that this game could be decent.
714.6,718.6, Right. Before when there's only 5% of the information available.
718.6,719.6, Yeah.
719.6,722.6, That's a principle worth arguing for.
722.6,723.6, I agree.
723.6,724.6, Here here.
724.6,726.6, But you do need to remember people.
726.6,730.6, If you've got any beef with the way that gun play works in your video games.
730.6,734.6, Shut your mouth until you go to a real firing range and miss a target at one foot away.
734.6,735.6, Right.
735.6,736.6, And you got it.
736.6,738.6, Seriously. I actually guns to.
738.6,740.6, And that's a cock and bull story right there.
740.6,745.6, And unless I honestly can't figure out what unless you're firing some like fucking musket
745.6,747.6, in your pack and a shit the gunpowder yourself.
747.6,749.6," Like, do you can't miss it a foot away?"
749.6,752.6," Right. Also, you know, part of the point of the gunpowder."
752.6,760.6," It could lie or pull all the point of what I said in the in that post which I didn't because I wasn't spending a whole lot of time thinking it from every, you know,"
760.6,762.6, I thought the point was obvious.
762.6,766.6," But in that game, it's not just that you're standing a foot away."
766.6,769.6, It's that it's that because it's turn based you're taking turns.
769.6,770.6, So I shoot you.
770.6,772.6, Then you I wait. Then you shoot me.
772.6,774.6, And then we see who misses.
774.6,775.6," I mean, that's not."
775.6,776.6, I'm sorry.
776.6,777.6, That's not realistic.
777.6,778.6, I'm sure that's not how it works.
778.6,779.6, But work.
779.6,786.6," You should have been well, if you care about that, why don't you seem to care about it when you're doing the same thing with access and fairy dust in world of work."
786.6,788.6, And the original point I was making.
788.6,790.6, You get a rich you up that way and I was giving the ammo.
790.6,795.6, The original point wasn't that I thought that Fallout was realistic or it wasn't even about realism.
795.6,797.6, I was just saying I had there were some things about Fallout.
797.6,799.6, I didn't like people that think one of them.
799.6,801.6, And he was sort of responding back.
801.6,803.6, What you're shooting like it because it was real.
803.6,806.6, Just like the killing mutants was realistic.
806.6,808.6, I guess that's the thing.
808.6,815.6," You know when you play shooters and you go into any game like you know in search and see your red orchestra and if you've got one complaint, it's like it's real."
815.6,816.6, Shut up.
816.6,817.6, That's realism.
817.6,823.6," Because you're like, okay, it's going to take me 40 minutes to get across the map to where I'm going to get shot ahead and spawn again."
823.6,824.6, Shut up.
824.6,825.6, That's real.
825.6,826.6," Like, well, I don't care."
826.6,827.6, This is a fucking game.
827.6,828.6," Yeah, it's the real is."
828.6,829.6," Oh, they both are fun."
829.6,834.6," Real is there's no one that thinks that that's fun to like, you know, in red orchestra to run into no man's land."
834.6,835.6, Get hit by our tillery.
835.6,840.6," And if that spares you then to get hit by a tank shell or something, it's like, okay, sure."
840.6,841.6," Yeah, you're right."
841.6,842.6, You're looking for.
842.6,844.6," I mean, we were talking about all this shit before the break."
844.6,845.6, Right.
845.6,846.6, Right.
846.6,851.6," Also, by the way, those guys, these singers were referring to counter strike as clownster strike."
851.6,852.6, Get it?
852.6,857.6," Because like, because people think that game's realistic when actually the realistic shooting games fall out."
857.6,858.6, Yeah.
858.6,860.6, They're arguing for a fall in this realistic.
860.6,862.6, They make fun of paintball too.
862.6,867.6, They're usually go to the local paintball area just like hang over the fence and talk shit on the players.
867.6,870.6, It's about how they should be playing a fallout.
870.6,871.6, A bunch of pansies.
871.6,873.6, Cook it's your fallout on it.
873.6,874.6, Yeah.
874.6,878.6, They do live action role playing it of the fallout battle system.
878.6,882.6," The sad thing is imagine that like we're staying, they're standing a foot apart from one of them."
882.6,888.6, They have like a third guy running between them to simulate whatever is story about the dude running through the middle of the guy.
888.6,897.6," So if I had to make a top 10 favorite PC games in the last decade or so, or ever, fallout would be on it."
897.6,900.6," If someone were to say, hey Jeff, are you a huge fallout fan?"
900.6,901.6, I would say yes.
901.6,902.6, Yes.
902.6,906.6," But now I don't, you know."
906.6,911.6," Well, one of the arguments on that thread was like, yeah, but you play it once a year, like almost everyone else does in this place."
911.6,914.6," And I'm like, I can't think of a single game."
914.6,916.6, I've brought out once a year and play through.
917.6,919.6," Like, is that a religious observance at that point?"
919.6,922.6," Yeah, that's beyond fandom."
922.6,923.6, Yeah.
923.6,928.6," It's like, well, maybe like a Pac-Man or something, you know, one of those kind of, but there's no like long kind of the calendar mark off."
928.6,930.6," You days Bobby, seven more."
930.6,931.6," Pac-Man, those are the game."
931.6,934.6, But your mind is falling out in month.
934.6,937.6, I do like Pac-Man's realistic pellet eating though.
937.6,938.6," This is, it's funny."
938.6,939.6, I'll do it.
939.6,944.6," This is a big, this is a totally fascinating aspect of gaming for me."
944.6,952.6," And we brought it up in last week's podcast when I mentioned that I was talking to some of the guys that make like, you know, wolf and Stein and Quake Wars."
952.6,966.6," And specifically for them, how the people who are talking the most shit about their game now are the people that are playing the hell out of the last game that they made or the last patch version or something."
966.6,969.6," And then when, you know, step it back a year before then."
969.6,973.6, And then they were talking shit on whatever that game was and saying the version before.
973.6,990.6," But you just have this like the equivalent of the gaming Ted because it's, you know, and so in these guys are somewhere in a cabin with their Texas instruments and commentors and playing this game and saying that, you know, like, it's just like inconceivable that you'd play anything new or that you'd accept any kind of change."
990.6,993.6, And counter strikes got the same guys too.
993.6,994.6, It's all about 0.6.
994.6,995.6," Yeah, source."
995.6,996.6, What the fuck's that?
996.6,997.6, That's not real.
997.6,998.6, It's not counter strike.
998.6,999.6, Right.
999.6,1001.6, And I actually encourage people.
1001.6,1011.6," I want to sort of track the communities where this is, I mean better parallel to what's happening on fall out now where it's like, it's just you have, you know, your sacred cow."
1011.6,1013.6, You don't want anyone messing with it.
1013.6,1019.6," And or whatever subsets, you know, I'm sure they're there for it happened with Eve at various points and stuff maybe X com and stuff."
1019.6,1021.6," But just like, here's the game."
1021.6,1023.6, This is how it was and times stop right.
1024.6,1028.6," You didn't even people who were like doing that for Star Wars galaxies, which was widely acknowledged as sure."
1028.6,1030.6," Okay, ask game and we'll do it."
1030.6,1031.6, We'll do it.
1031.6,1032.6, We'll do it.
1032.6,1033.6, Yeah.
1033.6,1034.6, Yeah.
1034.6,1039.6," Everquest people lamented that when they started adding things to make it easier, people were bitching, you know, battlefield."
1039.6,1042.6," Ashara on's calls that way too, between one and two."
1042.6,1045.6," I remember everyone, I worked at a grocery store."
1045.6,1048.6, And there was just this being this chick out of the truth.
1048.6,1052.6, It's just like herner husband or fiends for that game and they're both like having like real world extramarital affairs with the game.
1052.6,1055.6, And that's what you're talking about.
1055.6,1058.6, But I'm in between the talk about about that.
1058.6,1063.6, I kind of figured out that they didn't like the Ashara on's call to you so much.
1063.6,1066.6," You know, there have never quest to ever quest to."
1066.6,1067.6, That's why they're still playing.
1067.6,1068.6, We'll play ever quest one.
1068.6,1069.6, Right.
1069.6,1080.6," I mean, I do feel it's totally understandable to be a big fan of something and to not want it to be fucked with to feel like even sort of violated if somebody has taken your sacred franchise."
1080.6,1087.6," I mean, we could probably come up with a TV show or move your book series where if somebody else was taking it over, we would be like,"
1087.6,1089.6," Good, you're going to, you don't understand."
1089.6,1091.6, You understand JK Rowling.
1091.6,1093.6, I don't want Tom Clancy writing Harry Potter 8.
1093.6,1095.6, He's going to fuck it up.
1095.6,1100.6," But then, you know, you can understand that, but then don't read it."
1100.6,1103.6," You know, or don't just, just go away."
1103.6,1105.6, Like you don't have to go away.
1105.6,1106.6, Just go away.
1106.6,1107.6, Go play far out again.
1107.6,1108.6, It's still there.
1108.6,1112.6, That's not going to be made at a Frank Herbert's son for writing more doing books.
1112.6,1113.6, I'm just not going to read them.
1113.6,1114.6, You just don't acknowledge it.
1114.6,1115.6, Right.
1115.6,1120.6," If you're not feeling the idea of a Transformers movie, you got your VHS cassettes in the cartoon."
1120.6,1121.6, Right.
1121.6,1122.6," You got your Marvel comics, you know?"
1122.6,1126.6," I don't have to, you know, I don't have to pretend that Gilmour Girls season seven didn't happen."
1126.6,1128.6," Amy Sherman Paladin, what was gone."
1128.6,1129.6," Okay, Jeff."
1129.6,1133.6," And all that lame writing that they did, it just didn't happen."
1133.6,1134.6, That's not canon.
1134.6,1137.6," You actually, you're basically describing all the time."
1137.6,1138.6, Aren't you?
1138.6,1139.6," Yeah, complaining about these things."
1139.6,1143.6, I can't believe that they had Luke get back together with Laura.
1143.6,1147.6," Amy Sherman Paladin, you know, never would've pursued that relationship."
1147.6,1150.6," This is also, this is huge in comics."
1150.6,1151.6, All right.
1151.6,1156.6," Just whole, like, principle, but DC comics is interesting and that they will listen to,"
1156.6,1159.6, you'll get the equivalent of the diehard fall fans for DC comics and they'll listen to him long enough.
1159.6,1161.6," And then they'll be like, well, they're probably, all right."
1161.6,1162.6, Let's give it to him.
1162.6,1164.6," And then they just say, like, well, none of that shit had."
1164.6,1167.6, Remember the last five years of comics that pieces shit comics we're putting out?
1167.6,1169.6, That didn't happen anymore.
1169.6,1171.6," And now, of a sudden, there's some new crisis."
1171.6,1174.6, And that means that we're listening to these fans over here.
1174.6,1175.6, Right.
1175.6,1176.6," Well, comic book fans."
1176.6,1178.6, Marvel's going to be doing that right now.
1178.6,1179.6, The lecture.
1179.6,1181.6," Now that we're at the end of the podcast, we can get close to them."
1181.6,1183.6," Yeah, we can talk a little bit of comics."
1183.6,1186.6," But Marvel's, I guess they just revealed that like everyone in the Marvel Universe is a scroll."
1186.6,1188.6, That pretty much is what?
1188.6,1190.6," Is this scroll, which is an alien?"
1190.6,1191.6," Oh, really?"
1191.6,1194.6," Basically, like, remember the stupid one they had like the Spider-Man clone thing?"
1194.6,1195.6, Yeah.
1195.6,1196.6, And that bomb.
1196.6,1199.6," This is basically like saying, let's make the entire Marvel Universe a spider clone."
1199.6,1200.6," So, wow."
1200.6,1201.6, Wow.
1201.6,1202.6," Well, it's nice."
1202.6,1204.6," At some point, they'll just be like,"
1204.6,1205.6, This is specifically a regular select people.
1205.6,1208.6, I heard because they made roles and have always been scrolls.
1208.6,1210.6," They made a lecture a scroll, right?"
1210.6,1213.6," Because they were, because I guess Frank Miller, and I don't know if this is true or not."
1213.6,1217.6, Frank Miller was never going to work with Marvel again because he was still pissed off that they uncult her.
1217.6,1219.6, So this is what their solution is.
1219.6,1221.6," So it's really, they're accounting it."
1221.6,1224.6," So she's really, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,"
1224.6,1225.6," Ah, alright."
1225.6,1229.6," It's set up like, which one of you assholes is the Battle Star Galactic of Ann,"
1229.6,1232.6," and it's too stupid to realize that what works well there is,"
1232.6,1234.6, is going to fuck up the Marvel Universe.
1234.6,1235.6, Yeah.
1235.6,1236.6, Wow.
1236.6,1238.6, That's rad.
1238.6,1241.6, I'm so glad I'm at a comics.
1241.6,1245.6," See, now my memories of the Marvel Universe are preserved."
1245.6,1248.6," The way it was, the when it was right."
1248.6,1250.6, But you go online and argue with people about it.
1250.6,1252.6, Don't you wish Chris Klamot were still any X-Men?
1252.6,1254.6," Oh man, no, he got all those."
1254.6,1255.6, Oh god.
1255.6,1257.6," They were the good old, but when he came back, it was embarrassing."
1257.6,1259.6," Yeah, he can't right now."
1259.6,1260.6," Alright, but he could back in the day."
1260.6,1262.6, Classic X-Men's.
1262.6,1263.6, That shit isn't holding up.
1263.6,1264.6, Classic.
1264.6,1266.6," It doesn't, no, the old ones do it from the 70s."
1266.6,1267.6," No, I look back."
1267.6,1269.6, That stuff doesn't hold up at all.
1269.6,1271.6," Sometimes like E.C. comics will,"
1271.6,1273.6, but I don't have been to Stoutra Vacher.
1273.6,1275.6," I like, I'm reading these, you know, like as a first."
1275.6,1276.6, Yeah.
1276.6,1277.6, It wasn't born at the time.
1277.6,1279.6, And sometimes those are actually pretty good.
1279.6,1281.6," But old Marvel, the stuff I grew up on,"
1281.6,1283.6, Klamot and I just like you're saying.
1283.6,1285.6," Audrents is, I can't read that."
1285.6,1286.6, Alright.
1286.6,1287.6, I can't do it.
1287.6,1289.6," But dude, don't take my word for it."
1289.6,1293.6," We've all got different, different points of view."
1293.6,1294.6, Trophet.
1294.6,1295.6, That is true.
1295.6,1297.6, That's what makes us a great world.
1297.6,1298.6, We're just back from the break.
1298.6,1300.6, I'm already fucking in a law.
1300.6,1302.6, What does it usually come back from the break ready to go?
1302.6,1305.6," Yeah, it's usually the high point of the podcast."
1305.6,1306.6, Oh well.
1306.6,1307.6, We're back.
1307.6,1311.6, We're back from the break.
1311.6,1317.6, We got an outloader bit of ways to go.
1317.6,1320.6, What should we talk about next?
1320.6,1323.6, This one up podcast is brought to you by Games for Windows.
1323.6,1325.6, Welcome to Better PC Gaming.
1325.6,1328.6, Created with the idea that gaming should deliver more.
1328.6,1332.6, Games for Windows branded titles bring you all the fun of gaming without all the work.

1341.6,1342.6, Okay.
1342.6,1345.6, We're going to take a break and we'll be right back.
1345.6,1346.6, Alright.
1346.6,1355.6," So, a while ago we were reading some snarky things that we found online and other magazines from other publications."
1355.6,1360.6, Kind of our ongoing thing of finding lame game writing and then making fun of it.
1360.6,1366.6, And we promised at the time we were saying we know we're not immune here at our magazine.
1366.6,1368.6, We're not trying to be holier than now.
1368.6,1369.6, We just wanted all to stop.
1369.6,1371.6, We want the bad stuff to go away.
1371.6,1374.6, And but we promised that we would find our own bad writing.
1374.6,1375.6, And so we did.
1375.6,1377.6, We're true to our word here.
1377.6,1378.6, It games for Windows.
1378.6,1379.6, The official magazine.
1379.6,1382.6, And now we're going to read some of our official bad.
1382.6,1383.6, The thing is though.
1383.6,1384.6, Yeah.
1384.6,1385.6, We didn't print it.
1385.6,1386.6, That was the.
1386.6,1387.6," Well, that's true."
1387.6,1388.6, That was the case.
1388.6,1389.6, We're going to make for ourselves.
1389.6,1390.6," Just when we're trying to say, all right."
1390.6,1391.6, We'll admit we suck to you.
1391.6,1394.6," But then we really kind of jumped in and say, well, actually we won't print it."
1394.6,1395.6, What is that back?
1395.6,1396.6, Right.
1396.6,1397.6, We don't associate that was so bad.
1397.6,1398.6, We didn't.
1398.6,1399.6, Yes.
1399.6,1400.6, So here's.
1400.6,1403.6, But it was written for our magazine by someone who was on the staff of the magazine.
1403.6,1404.6, Yes.
1404.6,1405.6, It was.
1405.6,1406.6, This is the abort button.
1406.6,1408.6, Who is no longer on the staff.
1408.6,1409.6, Right.
1409.6,1412.6, So Ryan is going to be our guest reader.
1412.6,1413.6, Okay.
1413.6,1414.6, So.
1414.6,1415.6, What you're about to hear.
1415.6,1420.6," So that was, as it was submitted to to the editor."
1420.6,1422.6," Ryan, you're an intern at the time, right?"
1422.6,1424.6, And you were editing this.
1424.6,1427.6, This was after I was hired full time.
1427.6,1429.6, Okay.
1429.6,1431.6," Anyway, okay."
1431.6,1433.6, So this is from.
1433.6,1435.6, I guess I'm having 2004.
1435.6,1437.6, It's a preview for Warhammer.
1437.6,1440.6," 40,000 down and four, which was THQs."
1440.6,1443.6," Warhammer 40,000 RTS."
1444.6,1447.6," And the the strap line below, which is the."
1447.6,1451.6, The little headline right below the game name and preview.
1451.6,1455.6," The strap line is too legit to quit, which makes no sense."
1455.6,1456.6, Let me go here.
1456.6,1461.6, And this is how the preview goes.
1461.6,1464.6, Right.
1464.6,1465.6, Talk to me.
1465.6,1466.6, Pretend I wrote it.
1466.6,1469.6," And you could just talk to me like, like, you just, I just turned this into you."
1469.6,1470.6, If you need to.
1471.6,1474.6, I just saying if you need to direct some comments as you read it and you want to
1474.6,1476.6, relive the astonishment.
1476.6,1477.6, The.
1477.6,1481.6, This thing is actually lined with a commentary from the editor.
1481.6,1484.6," Oh, let's talk to Mike."
1484.6,1485.6, Mike.
1485.6,1486.6, Yeah.
1486.6,1487.6, Okay.
1487.6,1489.6," So here's the preview of Warhammer 40,000."
1489.6,1490.6, Tov Four.
1491.6,1493.6," Daylight comes, but me no want to go home."
1493.6,1495.6, Ha ha ha.
1495.6,1497.6, Flame more hammer 40K.
1497.6,1503.1799999999998, four hours have been sacrificed to late beta bills as I lose complete track of time and
1503.1799999999998,1505.32, stumble my way home horribly late.
1505.32,1509.52, Proof already that don't have war grind and smack other strategy games down with its deliverance
1509.52,1511.76, of one damn impactful RTS.
1511.76,1514.1599999999999, So that's your first paragraph.
1514.1599999999999,1516.0, So that now you're going to your studio.
1516.0,1518.36, Could you read that for a sentence again just for a minute?
1518.36,1520.76, Daylight comes but me no one will go.
1520.76,1521.76, Okay.
1521.76,1526.84, Is it a little bit too legit?
1526.84,1527.84, Okay.
1527.84,1532.48," Unlike most strategy games where you feel disconnected from the action, Donovor's camera can"
1532.48,1535.8799999999999, zoom right in on the frenzy from there in bracket.
1535.8799999999999,1539.3999999999999, It says more crack three that you do to a couple years ago.
1539.3999999999999,1542.9599999999998, That's a mention that the dangling modifier for it.
1542.9599999999998,1543.9599999999998, Yeah.
1543.9599999999998,1548.6399999999999, From there you can see the animation detail like a giant ork puppy feasting on the legions
1548.6399999999999,1550.6, of chaos.
1550.6,1556.52, These nuances even from a distance pump up the state repetition of other RTS's.
1556.52,1557.52, That's uttered.
1557.52,1558.52, This is right there.
1558.52,1559.52, We'll get back to that.
1559.52,1562.52, Pop up the state repetition.
1562.52,1566.08, In a war of hundreds battles feel alive.
1566.08,1571.6399999999999," Instead of the shrunken skill come into the genre, environment rise on a grand level."
1571.6399999999999,1576.6399999999999, Plus there's true personality orks let out a ringing poorly written song orks orks orks
1576.6399999999999,1579.24, orks.
1579.24,1581.6399999999999, The single player campaign.
1581.6399999999999,1585.96," Cash you is the space marine troop, the blood eagles."
1585.96,1587.44, Great care has been taken to balance.
1587.44,1593.8, Great care has been taken to balance the units ensuring raging single and multi-flare battles.
1593.8,1594.96, For example the L.D.
1594.96,1599.42, R.A.s quickly crumbles against Marines in melee which is why L.D.R. have travel gates
1599.42,1601.64, for speedy transport around the map.
1601.64,1604.0, Checks and balances folks.
1604.0,1608.48, And the one in brackets here says this is the hallmark of every strategy game going back
1608.48,1609.48, to chess.
1609.48,1610.48, It's not unique.
1610.48,1612.48, Checks and balances folks.
1612.52,1613.48, Yeah.
1613.48,1615.0, You drop that too.
1615.0,1618.4, It's almost as if you don't hear where the PR person for it.
1618.4,1619.4, Yeah.
1619.4,1620.4, So check it out.
1620.4,1621.4, I just showed this to you.
1621.4,1622.4, See what we got here.
1622.4,1624.4, The Ork can punch.
1624.4,1626.04, The other guy can shoot.
1626.04,1628.4, Checks and balances.
1628.4,1633.44, After you've been any of the 13 single player missions you can go back and play from the
1633.44,1634.44, opposition side.
1634.44,1638.84, And brackets says again who's the opposition.
1638.84,1644.1," The developer, notorious for a ridiculous difficulty in their single player games,"
1644.1,1647.48," has tweaked this campaign to still challenge, but be enjoyed by all."
1647.48,1651.08, Be enjoyed by all.
1651.08,1655.28, The first mission plays out in appropriate handholding tutorial style.
1655.28,1659.28, Your team must cut a swath through a flat map of Ork ground troops.
1659.28,1665.28, Further along the fifth mission features an ascending mountain.
1665.28,1670.24, The comment of Ragged's here says the post of what other kind of mountain.
1670.24,1673.44, Where enemy snipers take advantage of the high ground.
1673.44,1679.12, Anytime you can pause the action and set up to 99 commands per unit for finite precision.
1679.12,1685.68," With vicious a plumb, Donavor is home for the kill come fall 2004."
1685.68,1686.68, Vicious a plumb.
1686.68,1687.68, Yeah.
1687.68,1689.36, So I remember every day of my life.
1689.36,1691.72, Yeah.
1691.72,1695.48, The thing when he mentioned finite precision that the comment says as opposed to infinite
1695.48,1699.08," precision, also pausing action to set up commanders is another standard feature of"
1699.08,1701.8, strike games these days.
1701.8,1702.8, So the whole thing.
1702.8,1707.16, I see that one part because there's my favorite line in there.
1707.16,1709.16, My favorite was always ascending mountain.
1709.16,1710.16, Yeah.
1710.16,1711.16, It's funny.
1711.16,1715.88, I know about this because I think it was the first week that I joined the staff that
1715.88,1721.3600000000001, I was already made to sit down at a computer and read and laugh at this.
1721.36,1723.8, I did at that point that was I think that was my initiation.
1723.8,1724.8, Yeah.
1724.8,1728.24, I think we brought that out is how not to write for us.
1728.24,1729.24, Sending mountain.
1729.24,1730.24, What a descending mountain.
1730.24,1732.24, Isn't that called a crater?
1732.24,1733.24, Yeah.
1733.24,1734.24, This is an existence.
1734.24,1735.24, I don't know.
1735.24,1736.24, This is already.
1736.24,1740.84, This is even hands on either.
1740.84,1748.08," So he just saw, he just this is a preview with the not only fact that there's the nature of,"
1748.08,1750.08, I don't know.
1750.08,1753.36, In nature of the commentary you make and then the specific words he uses is correct me
1753.36,1754.36, up here.
1754.36,1757.8, But just proof already that Donovor grinds and smacks.
1757.8,1763.24, So the strategy games down with the deliverance of one damn impactful R to yes.
1763.24,1764.24, Yeah.
1764.24,1766.3999999999999, But just that it grinds and smacks them down.
1766.3999999999999,1767.3999999999999, Right.
1767.3999999999999,1769.3999999999999," Not only that, but with the deliverance of."
1769.3999999999999,1770.3999999999999, Right.
1770.3999999999999,1772.6399999999999, That was my overall thing was like.
1772.6399999999999,1773.6399999999999," Oh, yeah."
1773.6399999999999,1775.3999999999999, This is not a word.
1775.3999999999999,1776.3999999999999, Next comment.
1776.3999999999999,1778.6, This whole sentence is awkward.
1778.6,1779.6, You think?
1779.6399999999999,1782.12," Wait, what did I say wasn't a word impactful?"
1782.12,1783.12, Yeah.
1783.12,1787.08, He just tried to say things that like sounded good or he thought sounded good.
1787.08,1787.8799999999999, But it's as.
1787.8799999999999,1788.8799999999999, Yeah.
1788.8799999999999,1789.8799999999999," Anyway, nothing."
1789.8799999999999,1790.8799999999999, Nothing.
1790.8799999999999,1791.8799999999999, So again.
1791.8799999999999,1795.7199999999998, I had a farmer right or we love you.
1795.7199999999998,1797.32, Not as a writer for our magazine.
1797.32,1802.1599999999999," Oh, shit."
1802.1599999999999,1803.1599999999999, So yeah.
1803.1599999999999,1808.02," And when he starts talking about the single player campaign cashews, the space"
1808.02,1811.1," of the series, the buddy goes the comment is there is zero context here for what the"
1811.1,1813.1, buddy goes are as opposed to what other race.
1813.1,1814.1, What does this game about?
1814.1,1815.3799999999999, Who is fighting and why?
1815.3799999999999,1819.34," If I know nothing at warhammer like many readers, what would I know what this means?"
1819.34,1820.34, Yeah.
1820.34,1822.3, All in as I'm going to be told the thing in that works.
1822.3,1823.3, Orcs.
1823.3,1824.3, Orcs are all.
1824.3,1825.3, Yeah.
1825.3,1828.3799999999999, That's the thing is it's like it alternates caps in.
1828.3799999999999,1829.3799999999999, So what is it?
1829.3799999999999,1831.62, It's like orcs.
1831.62,1832.62, Okay.
1832.62,1837.7, Orcs all caps orcs no caps orcs with the R caped orcs with the K and S caped.
1838.54,1842.3400000000001, How do you work in the works orcs orcs?
1842.3400000000001,1843.74, That's personality though.
1843.74,1849.42, It was a computer gaming world inside joke before we switched that.
1849.42,1854.14," A one point Robert coffee who was, you know, if you listen to us and think or smart"
1854.14,1858.46," asses, Robert coffee was like Lord God King of smart asses."
1858.46,1862.26," And he had to do a review of, wait was it this very game?"
1862.26,1864.1000000000001, It was it was.
1864.1,1868.86," The review of this game, several of the screenshot captions used."
1868.86,1869.86, Right.
1869.86,1870.86, Robert coffee.
1870.86,1874.02, Robert coffee took quotes from this review and used the message screen.
1874.02,1875.02, Clap captions.
1875.02,1878.02, So I think we should find probably stupid.
1878.02,1879.02, Yeah.
1879.02,1880.02, You guys told me that.
1880.02,1881.5," I couldn't believe it because I'm like, okay, we'll so."
1881.5,1882.5," No, I'm going to get all the answers."
1882.5,1884.34, You guys are basically not with the total inside.
1884.34,1886.1399999999999, You guys write piece of shit captions.
1886.1399999999999,1887.1399999999999, Right.
1887.1399999999999,1889.02, So we did that for our own amusement.
1889.02,1890.02, Yeah.
1890.02,1894.06, The expense of the reader and also their impression.
1894.06,1896.4199999999998," Yeah, well, what are you going to do?"
1896.4199999999998,1897.74, You're in your note.
1897.74,1905.4199999999998," You even tell him to, please look at the September 2004 issue of computer games, which"
1905.4199999999998,1910.94, has a two page preview of the same game as an entirely different level from this.
1910.94,1911.94, I did.
1911.94,1913.74," Like here, look at this other message."
1913.74,1914.74, We could the competition.
1914.74,1915.74, Yeah.
1915.74,1916.74, How?
1916.74,1920.1399999999999," Well, not everyone was born to be a game journalist."
1920.1399999999999,1921.1399999999999, It's hard.
1921.22,1925.22, But a lot of them are anyway funny that.
1925.22,1926.22, Yeah.
1926.22,1930.0200000000002, Not that we're perfect.
1930.0200000000002,1936.5, So I guess we'll use this and force a transition to this other more serious.
1936.5,1937.5, Yeah.
1937.5,1940.74, But related topic that I've been meaning to address all week.
1940.74,1942.0600000000002, So you guys have to say about it.
1942.0600000000002,1947.9," And basically, well, the discussions started in the office via email."
1947.9,1954.42," And it was in response to New York Times online story that argued that, you know, much"
1954.42,1961.22," greater extent than what happens with film critics and moviegoers, game reviewers are"
1961.22,1964.22, in touch with the game buying public.
1964.22,1969.94," And actually, what it did is it looked at Medicare critic aggregates and said, you know,"
1969.94,1975.9," if games receive scores of, you know, 80% or above, these are also games that sold, like,"
1975.9,1976.9, well.
1977.22,1983.22," So that started this whole, you know, this discussion about, well, you know, this is a"
1983.22,1984.22, good thing.
1984.22,1986.74," I mean, at first everyone was like, oh, this is just this fantastic."
1986.74,1992.1000000000001," And it says we're more in touch with our audience, you know, especially compared to, you"
1992.1000000000001,1996.38," know, movie critics and if, and you know, here, this is where I have to step out and"
1996.38,1998.5800000000002," say, I'm speaking for myself alone here."
1998.5800000000002,2003.5400000000002," Because there's a great deal of, you know, our opinions are divided in the office."
2003.5400000000002,2004.38, And we think different things.
2004.38,2005.8200000000002," I think that's for the, for the better."
2005.8200000000002,2007.38, These are great discussions to kind of have.
2007.38,2011.0200000000002, And I just kind of wanted to kind of bring it back and continue it on the podcast because
2011.0200000000002,2014.8600000000001," I think it's, I don't know, I'm hoping it's interesting people because it ultimately comes"
2014.8600000000001,2021.0600000000002," back to you, you know, as someone who buys games and whether, how much you invest in"
2021.0600000000002,2025.66," reviews and how much you go, you turn the reviews to let them guide you in your decision,"
2025.66,2026.94," you know, in your buying decision."
2026.94,2032.42," But so the first thing that I, I didn't point out there, but I, I kind of, as soon as we"
2032.42,2035.98," came into the discussion, it came to me, I was like, well, for a near time story, I was kind"
2035.98,2041.3000000000002, of amazed that the writer and then the editor wasn't sort of differentiating between
2041.3000000000002,2043.18, correlation and causality.
2043.18,2048.5," And that, I say that because if you, you know, have data that says, Jeff, go ahead."
2048.5,2049.5, I'm sorry.
2049.5,2051.9," I haven't, like, horrible like I, yeah, if you go."
2051.9,2052.9, This is the lecture time.
2052.9,2053.9, Sorry.
2053.9,2054.9, Clancy sensation.
2054.9,2061.06," So anyway, but if you have data that says, games got on average of score of 80% or above,"
2061.06,2066.5," and then you say that on average games sold, whatever, a million units, you don't have,"
2066.5,2069.66," you can, you can put those two together and say, hey, there's likely a correlation here,"
2069.66,2073.42," and then you, you would divide as a correlation coefficient to see how strong that correlation"
2073.42,2074.7799999999997, is or how weak it is.
2074.7799999999997,2080.86, But what you wouldn't do is say that these positive scores are responsible for the sales
2080.86,2081.86, of these games.
2081.86,2083.62, And that's exactly what the writer did.
2083.62,2088.38," And, and just straight out, you know, without even saying, hey, before we make these sorts"
2088.38,2091.02," of sweeping statements, we need to take."
2091.02,2093.2599999999998, Add budgets into account.
2093.2599999999998,2096.94, We need to look at all these other variables that are going to influence this.
2096.94,2098.78," And instead, what is there?"
2098.78,2102.78," Because, you know, you could, you could have us review a bunch of these games and put"
2102.78,2105.38," our reviews in a, in a locked case somewhere."
2105.38,2106.38, Right.
2106.38,2109.02," And then when you open them years later, you could find out that the correlation is just still"
2109.02,2110.02, just a strong.
2110.02,2111.02, Right.
2111.02,2112.02, Right.
2112.02,2115.54," So, but that basically, I'm, I'm talking about, you know, like research methodology 101."
2115.54,2120.22," But anyway, that wasn't my point that, that that was, that that was, you know, slippery"
2120.22,2121.3799999999997," science, so to speak."
2121.3799999999997,2128.58," But, um, my issue immediately was like, well, should, should we really be so happy that"
2128.58,2131.8999999999996," we're all saying the exact same things, you know, and I thought about that."
2131.8999999999996,2136.8199999999997," And, you know, because I brought this up before, where, you know, I personally celebrate"
2136.8199999999997,2142.22," the diversity of viewpoints that you find in, you know, film criticism, which is a much"
2142.22,2146.8599999999997," more mature, um, you know, avenue criticism that's been around longer, St. The literary"
2146.8599999999997,2147.8599999999997, criticism.
2147.86,2152.1400000000003," And I don't, and the reason being is because, you know, and another thing I brought up"
2152.1400000000003,2155.82," on our thread, and then this became a point of content, is I said that I think that by"
2155.82,2160.1400000000003," and large, what happens in a gamer view is what I would call, you know, consumer reporting,"
2160.1400000000003,2161.1400000000003, totally.
2161.1400000000003,2164.42," And I differentiated that from criticism, but then that became the, the talking point,"
2164.42,2165.6600000000003," well, what, what does criticism mean?"
2165.6600000000003,2166.6600000000003," But so, it's a consumer reporting."
2166.6600000000003,2170.54, I think if we're looking at the game in the way we would at a vacuum cleaner and we're
2170.54,2172.7400000000002," saying, okay, ultimately, here's what it's supposed to do."
2172.7400000000002,2177.06," It's supposed to, you know, perform this function and does it do it or not, you know, and"
2177.06,2178.98, we can all more or less agree.
2178.98,2182.38," If you take enough people, you'll get a pretty good average, you know, it's not going"
2182.38,2184.2599999999998," to be, well, sorry, not an average."
2184.2599999999998,2188.7," But I think that you'll find for the most part, people are in agreement about the extent"
2188.7,2190.98," to which it, it, it functions."
2190.98,2194.82," You know, I mean, when a game's horribly broken, we all agree or something like that."
2194.82,2200.42," But the thing is, is that, you know, and another thing, it's kind of unfair, because, you"
2200.42,2203.62," know, like the other people that were, were in on discussion aren't here right now,"
2203.8599999999997,2208.54," and there, you know, so you guys, I mean, if you're in that camp, you can, you can provide"
2208.54,2209.54, their point of view.
2209.54,2215.18," But as far as I understand, it was like, well, the problem with so-called criticism is that"
2215.18,2218.8199999999997," it's ultimately, you know, and this is the big question with where we're at views."
2218.8199999999997,2220.42," Is it, is it, are you going to be a snob?"
2220.42,2221.74, Are you going to be pretentious?
2221.74,2223.7," You know, are you going to be an arrogant asshole?"
2223.7,2228.2599999999998, Or are you going to just speak to the people and say the same things that the people would
2228.2599999999998,2229.2599999999998, say?
2229.34,2234.6600000000003," And that was alarming to me because, for one, it was kind of like, when you begin"
2234.6600000000003,2237.3," a discussion by saying, are you with the troops?"
2237.3,2239.3, Or are you not with the troops?
2239.3,2242.0200000000004," You know, because, okay, go on."
2242.0200000000004,2246.2200000000003," Well, it's not to say for me, you know, anytime I write any review, I like Roger Eber"
2246.2200000000003,2251.2200000000003," had a quote where he said, I think it was the role of the critic is to, in front of the public opinion,"
2251.2200000000003,2252.2200000000003, not reflect it.
2252.2200000000003,2253.9," Right, not to be of a true equestrian."
2253.9,2254.9, Right.
2254.9,2258.7400000000002, So that's kind of how I've always been proud to be able to do this myself.
2259.22,2264.02," But the problem with that distinction is that, yeah, you can inform is, you know, if you say,"
2264.02,2267.8999999999996, you're going to be pretentious and you're going to epitomize all that's wrong with when
2267.8999999999996,2268.8999999999996, we're reviewing gets that.
2268.8999999999996,2273.06," When criticism gets at him, hand, and God knows it does, it can go horribly horribly wrong."
2273.06,2277.7," When you see, you know, a 60 page essay that's talking about that, you know, the box"
2277.7,2281.7," Cheerios on the table represent someone's, you know, Freudian, you know, dysfunctional Freudian"
2281.7,2282.7, relationship with someone else.
2282.7,2285.4599999999996," And the value that, of course, is total bullshit."
2285.54,2290.9, The other assumption was that criticism ultimately would entail identifying and arguing
2290.9,2292.34, what a game means.
2292.34,2296.82," And so I disagreed with both of those because for one, I would never try to, with a few"
2296.82,2297.82, exceptions.
2297.82,2300.3," I would never try to say, this is what this game means."
2300.3,2304.9," You know, this is when it's when, you know, the, the, the, the, the green triangle blows"
2304.9,2307.5, up the red rectangle and the white dots come out.
2307.5,2308.98, It's really trying to say this.
2308.98,2309.98, Of course not.
2309.98,2311.5, That's completely stupid.
2311.5,2314.86," And yeah, please kick me out of the building when I do that."
2314.86,2320.3," But instead what I would associate more criticism is that rather than saying, hey, it's"
2320.3,2323.5," just, this is fun to shoot these and to turn these into white things."
2323.5,2328.02," But to look at the whole thing and say, you know, what, what is it specifically that's"
2328.02,2331.9, making this fun or what's uniquely fun about this and the greater context of other games
2331.9,2334.9," that are like it, you know, that's like that."
2334.9,2341.98," That's like to be mutually exclusive with providing that, you know, the other part, you"
2341.98,2344.82," know, you, you can take a, you can take a, you can take a,"
2345.46,2349.5800000000004," more analytical perspective of a more white, why is this thing doing what it's doing?"
2349.5800000000004,2352.94, And yet still offer the quote unquote consumerist.
2353.46,2354.34, In your definitely kid.
2354.34,2357.26," Yeah, because ultimately you're still saying you're still saying that something's"
2357.26,2357.94, enjoyable.
2358.38,2358.5800000000004, Yeah.
2358.5800000000004,2361.5, So you're still getting that point and you're still going to address in the consumers thing.
2361.5,2366.1000000000004," What I identify with that is when you itemize things and you're really concerned with,"
2366.1000000000004,2370.1400000000003," here's the part, you know, if it's not the paragraph, here's the sentence or the clause"
2370.14,2375.7799999999997," of a sentence where I identify that the graphics are, are good, that the performance,"
2375.7799999999997,2378.54," you know, is high quality frame rates and stuff like that."
2378.7799999999997,2384.62," Where I talk about the audio and the thing, the problem I have to see when you start to"
2384.62,2390.14," discuss a game specifically in these terms, you know, as the sum of, of its feature set or"
2390.14,2394.46," something, you know, you're ultimately kind of like left going in circles because you're,"
2394.46,2397.66," like, say if you, there's a truly unique game that comes out and you're trying to say,"
2397.66,2399.2999999999997," hey, I really want people to play this."
2399.2999999999997,2401.14, I had a fucking great time playing it.
2401.14,2402.46, But I want you to trust me.
2402.46,2404.66, But the problem is I'm a stranger to you.
2404.66,2409.8999999999996," You're building people in your life that, who's opinions you trust, who serve as filters"
2409.8999999999996,2413.3799999999997," for you in that they say, hey, John, check this game out."
2413.3799999999997,2416.94," It's red and they don't need to tell you why, you know, they might not be the most"
2416.94,2417.94, articulate thing.
2417.94,2421.2599999999998," But you just trust them because, you know, nine times eight times out of ten, they've"
2421.26,2425.9," recommended something and, you know, sure enough, you enjoyed it to the extent that they"
2425.9,2429.1400000000003, seem to indicate you would.
2429.1400000000003,2432.78," But now, you know, we're in the internet too and not only is it people in our immediate,"
2432.78,2436.5800000000004," you know, environment, but people online, message boards that we frequent stuff."
2436.5800000000004,2439.6200000000003," And so what happens is we have all the, these people are everywhere."
2439.6200000000003,2444.7000000000003," There's, there's not like there's some kind of vacuum on, on feedback on games or anything,"
2444.7000000000003,2445.7000000000003, right?
2445.7000000000003,2446.7000000000003, That's just over.
2446.7000000000003,2448.26," It, it, it's just everywhere."
2448.26,2449.26, Right.
2449.6200000000003,2453.3," I think if I'm going to say something and I don't know you, you don't know shit about"
2453.3,2454.3, me.
2454.3,2457.5800000000004, And I'm going to say something and it's worth your time to read.
2457.5800000000004,2460.3," I've got to do more than say, hey, this is a fun game."
2460.3,2464.98," I need to do a few things and I need to explain why I think it's fun, like, and everything"
2464.98,2465.98, I just said.
2465.98,2470.98, And the thing is is that you got to keep audience in mind here and you can use language that
2470.98,2475.1400000000003," might be off putting or, or pretentious or whatever, but you can also use any language you"
2475.1400000000003,2477.1000000000004, want.
2477.1,2482.18," I think guys like Malcolm Gladwell who wrote the, you know, pop bestsellers, taping"
2482.18,2486.66," point and blink, Steve Johnson, everything bad is good for you."
2486.66,2488.06," You know, just use them as examples."
2488.06,2492.2999999999997," If you, if you look at their books, they're full of excellent ideas, but they're presented"
2492.2999999999997,2497.1," in very, very plain language that's accessible to anyone with, you know, even a baseline"
2497.1,2499.9, reading love and entry level literacy.
2499.9,2502.46, And their ideas are great.
2502.46,2504.38," And that's what matters because, you know, the opposite."
2504.38,2508.1400000000003," I think, you know, pretentious or whatever, would be when you've got in-siped ideas and"
2508.1400000000003,2509.38, you have fake intellectual language.
2509.38,2510.38, Right.
2510.38,2512.34," And that's like the worst, you know, message board posts you've ever seen."
2512.34,2515.6600000000003," It's like 10,000 words and it's basically asking you if you think like a multiplayer"
2515.6600000000003,2519.1400000000003, game should be considered art.
2519.1400000000003,2523.06," So this is, this is in direct distinction to that, you know, this is a conversation"
2523.06,2524.06, to it.
2524.06,2525.98," And, and I think this is fun."
2525.98,2530.26," I think that actually people will remember when someone, you know, in life, when someone"
2530.26,2533.7000000000003," says comedians work too, you know, the great, the best, sometimes the best joke you hear,"
2533.7,2535.46," it's like, oh, that's funny because it's true."
2535.46,2539.46, But when someone is able to take an articulate and explain something that you've already
2539.46,2542.18, felt that you felt for the longest time to be true.
2542.18,2544.9399999999996," And you're like, oh, but this is actually why that's true."
2544.9399999999996,2549.4199999999996," And now that gives me ammunition to explain myself, conversely, they might present to"
2549.4199999999996,2551.06, an idea that you had never considered.
2551.06,2555.3799999999997, But then once you take it and you play with it and you're in this process of deciding
2555.3799999999997,2558.7799999999997," whether or not you agree with it or whether or not you think it's valid later on, if you"
2558.7799999999997,2560.8999999999996," accept it, then it changes your perspective."
2560.9,2564.7400000000002," And when you're playing the next game and when you're sort of perception has been changed,"
2564.7400000000002,2566.14, you're evaluating it differently.
2566.14,2567.14, Right.
2567.14,2571.5," And all the stuff, it sounds academic, but I think it happens in the plainest terms possible"
2571.5,2572.5, just naturally.
2572.5,2573.5, Right.
2573.5,2574.5, But it works.
2574.5,2576.6600000000003," And I think if you do those things, that's memorable."
2576.6600000000003,2578.02, And that's a memorable review.
2578.02,2581.58," And that, I think in my personal opinion, something that I would try to provide to someone"
2581.58,2586.2200000000003," so that I would say, hey, otherwise, yeah, I mean, because I, like personally, I don't"
2586.2200000000003,2588.9, I don't see most people working in the century.
2588.9,2590.86, Don't think like you.
2590.86,2595.3," But I mean, most people aren't taking their review out that way at all."
2595.3,2600.98," They're just, you know, they're trying to cram 300 words out as fast as they can."
2600.98,2604.6200000000003, And they're following a cookie cutter or a punch because that's all they know.
2604.6200000000003,2607.46," And make, you know, this is a point that some of the guys at Penny Arcade of Race"
2607.46,2611.1," before is like, and if, you know, again, you're trying to convince people that they"
2611.1,2615.7000000000003," ought to be reading their reviews that you're buying your magazines, clicking your pages"
2615.7000000000003,2616.86, and stuff.
2616.86,2620.7000000000003," And if not only do they not know you, but then if they knew that you were trying to"
2620.7,2624.2599999999998," hurry up and get something done, maybe we didn't even want to play the game, maybe"
2624.2599999999998,2629.74," you're just like, you know, and if they knew these other things too, I mean, how much less"
2629.74,2635.1, would they value perspective in the first place next to the next to their friend who
2635.1,2636.1," sure, it's a blockbuster."
2636.1,2637.1, Right.
2637.1,2640.8199999999997," So, and again, that's the thing is, I was wondering, it didn't happen, but I was waiting"
2640.8199999999997,2644.8599999999997," for someone to say, oh, but what you're doing is saying is ultimately snobbery."
2644.8599999999997,2648.18," You're saying, but you're a special kind of writer, a special kind of critic, and you"
2648.18,2650.2999999999997, do something that the average Joe can't.
2650.3,2656.7000000000003," But I don't think there's anything that's, you know, that involves snobbery with that,"
2656.7000000000003,2660.98," because any more so than someone who was, you know, a painter by occupation or a photographer"
2660.98,2664.6400000000003," would say, you know, when you approach him, say, hey, what you do is job for me and they"
2664.6400000000003,2666.5800000000004," go, and there's a disposable camera."
2666.5800000000004,2667.5800000000004, There's a pencil.
2667.5800000000004,2668.5800000000004, I want you to get anyone to do it.
2668.5800000000004,2672.26," Because no, like they've, I'm a photographer, I'm a painter because yes, I do believe"
2672.26,2677.0600000000004, that I have experience and that I have a certain amount of talent doing this thing.
2677.06,2680.5," And yeah, and I think you should say that if you're a writer and that's your occupation,"
2680.5,2683.2999999999997," you damn well, better say that otherwise with the fuck you doing."
2683.2999999999997,2684.2999999999997," You know, right."
2684.2999999999997,2685.82," Go, so I don't think that's snobbery."
2685.82,2686.82, I think that's just right.
2686.82,2690.5," Yeah, this is what we, you know, what we dedicate."
2690.5,2695.7," And so, you know, another thing to, and this is interesting too, because this discussion was"
2695.7,2699.2599999999998," happening last week, and then this week on this gapest.com, I haven't read all of their"
2699.2599999999998,2704.54," current issue, which is basically it's all available for free online."
2704.54,2708.22, So I'm not going to advocate it because there could be some pieces in there that I don't
2708.22,2709.22, like.
2709.22,2713.4," But of what I read, it was really interesting, and that, you know, I saw like, you know,"
2713.4,2717.74," war inspector, you know, of Deus Ex fame was saying some similar things about audience"
2717.74,2718.98, and getting to know someone.
2718.98,2723.66," And one thing, he was suggesting that critics can do to make their selves more valuable."
2723.66,2728.58," Their services more valuable is to establish, not only just a voice in terms of a style"
2728.58,2731.7," or something, but establish themselves as critical minds."
2731.7,2735.8599999999997," So that people can say, you know, like, oh, ebert, you have a certain right assumption"
2735.8599999999997,2737.62, about this is what he likes.
2737.62,2738.62, This is what he thinks.
2738.62,2744.5," I think there's a few of those in this industry, but by and large, the medium, some"
2744.5,2746.2599999999998, selves don't encourage that.
2746.2599999999998,2749.1, They don't encourage personalities to stand out.
2749.1,2751.9399999999996," This is more that like, Lester Baines and New York games."
2751.9399999999996,2753.22," Well, I don't think it's sex."
2753.22,2757.14," It's not about, I think the hitch there is thinking that you need to have a bunch of people"
2757.14,2760.02, seeking fame and to try to be superstar reviewers.
2760.02,2765.7," Instead of just like, there's a byline there and you recognize that byline."
2765.7,2769.7," And you know, and it tells you something about it."
2769.7,2770.7, It tells you something about it.
2770.7,2771.7, It tells you something about it.
2771.7,2773.7, It's just being into the same kind of stuff I'm making.
2773.7,2779.2999999999997," And yeah, not only like, not just the simple level, the old, you know, like the, you"
2779.2999999999997,2782.98," know, because this is how you encourage it at Eddie Gempty, where you have three reviews"
2782.98,2783.98, for each thing.
2783.98,2786.7," You say, oh, well, this is John or someone, and I, you know, or this is David."
2786.7,2792.3399999999997," And I agree with them in the past, but even more specifically, it's not that like my friend"
2792.3399999999997,2796.14," who's given me, who's been a good filter for me in that his recommendations have been, you"
2796.14,2798.2999999999997," know, have been good recommendations."
2798.2999999999997,2804.1," But it's like, I understand, you know, more specifically what I can put words on it, what"
2804.1,2808.9399999999996, this person thinks makes a good game of this genre or whatever or just a good game or
2808.9399999999996,2809.9399999999996, something like that.
2809.9399999999996,2810.9399999999996, And I think we could do that.
2810.9399999999996,2811.9399999999996, It's difficult.
2811.9399999999996,2812.9399999999996, But I think we could do it.
2812.94,2817.82," And I just don't, I guess I'm just reacting really to this idea that for one, we should"
2817.82,2823.18," be saying exactly, we should be in complete agreement with our readers."
2823.18,2826.18," And the other, you know, it shouldn't, I don't, it should not be threatening to let me,"
2826.18,2830.82," let me, let me, let me, let me get us, let me get back to that, to that New York Times article."
2830.82,2835.98," Because I, I do think there's a, a couple of points here that about this thing that that are,"
2835.98,2840.7000000000003," that are actually, well, let me just run this by you."
2840.7799999999997,2846.46," You know, his point was that one of his points was that we're, as he said at the beginning,"
2846.46,2853.3399999999997," that we're more in line with the game rankings, the, the game reviews are in line with the,"
2853.3399999999997,2856.58, the games that people are buying so that there's a correlation there.
2856.58,2857.58, Yeah.
2857.58,2862.2999999999997," And it, but the other side of that is that in things like movies, it's not."
2862.2999999999997,2867.8999999999996," So you can go look at the top 10 box office and you'll see, whatever, you'll see some"
2867.8999999999996,2869.46, bullshit horrible movies on there.
2869.5,2870.3, Jack or whatever.
2870.3,2870.5, Right.
2870.5,2873.1," And number one and you got to, you got to, right."
2873.1,2875.38," It was made out of, and it's got like 16%."
2875.38,2880.7400000000002," And so it's like, okay, people are going to go to these dumbass movies, no matter what."
2880.7400000000002,2884.7," And the, the critics, you could take it as one way, the critics are out of touch."
2884.7,2886.38, They're too intellectual for this movie.
2886.38,2890.62," So you don't, they don't understand what America wants to go see, blah, blah, blah."
2890.62,2893.5, And that's probably true to some extent.
2893.5,2897.42," I mean, so one, one way, I think they understand what, what the average joke is to see,"
2897.5,2900.46," but it's not your, or the average joke doesn't just give a fuck."
2900.46,2902.58, They want to go to the movies.
2902.58,2903.58, It's only $10.
2903.58,2904.82," Or they're going, they've got a kid."
2904.82,2908.94," Yeah, whatever it is, that they just are just going at 10 years old."
2908.94,2910.82, All they know is Robin Williams is in it.
2910.82,2911.94, And that's good enough for them.
2911.94,2914.1800000000003," So let's go see this, but fuck movie."
2914.1800000000003,2915.58, And that's sorry.
2915.58,2919.98," And because Robin Williams is in it, doesn't matter the rotten tomato is given to,"
2919.98,2924.46," where we're going, because Robin Williams made us laugh and more can midi 25 years ago."
2924.46,2932.02," So, but, and so the difference, I think, is that we're, one of the reasons why it's so much closer"
2932.02,2938.06, is because I think the gamers are actually smarter and more informed.
2938.06,2941.7400000000002," Well, there's the value thing that which I, which I, the introduce, and I agree with is that when"
2941.7400000000002,2946.42," you're paying $60 for a game versus the 10 for a movie, although that gets complicated."
2946.42,2949.82, If you're the guy and you're doing the old school thing and you're paying for your date and
2949.82,2953.7," the popcorn and the nachos and the right, the drinks, you're up to the game."
2953.7,2958.06," But I think it's one of the things about this community, we're still like, basically the"
2958.06,2960.5, same kinds of people talking to each other.
2960.5,2962.02, So that's why it's close.
2962.02,2963.66, You don't have families in Iowa.
2963.66,2964.66, I was definitely the kid.
2964.66,2970.02, We don't read anything just going wandering into Walmart and buying counter strike.
2970.02,2971.02, Right.
2971.02,2972.66, People buying it already know about it.
2972.66,2975.46," And yeah, those are most of the people in the industry."
2975.46,2979.06," Like you said, we're just for better or worse, it's just people that play games."
2979.06,2980.06, And I think that's good.
2980.58,2985.02," I personally believe, you know, but in accordance with the outline I just gave, I think"
2985.02,2989.18," we should be people that just play games, but we should also be people who are maybe"
2989.18,2993.86, who put a lot more time and effort into thinking through and talking about and evaluating
2993.86,2994.86, and analyzing games.
2994.86,2995.86," Well, yes."
2995.86,2999.2599999999998," You know, but the other thing is, and it's because I fear it's like, well, yeah, if you"
2999.2599999999998,3002.42," just take anyone off the street and you say, hey, your camera viewer, you're going to have"
3002.42,3006.22," consensus like that, you know, it's there."
3006.22,3010.7799999999997," But is that the same as saying, like, finally, we could celebrate mediocrity?"
3010.7799999999997,3012.66," You know, I mean, I just don't want it to be that."
3012.66,3013.66, Right.
3013.66,3017.98," Well, it's possible that like something like the Wii, if it keeps on the trajectory,"
3017.98,3022.2999999999997, it's on is going to be the game machine that starts doing the same thing that happens
3022.2999999999997,3023.62, with movies and automators.
3023.62,3024.62, Yeah.
3024.62,3028.2599999999998," Where like everybody is buying Wii fit and all the critics are going, oh, my God,"
3028.2599999999998,3030.2599999999998, don't buy that pizza shit by Mario Gallax.
3030.2599999999998,3031.98, How long have we been doing it with Sims?
3031.98,3032.98," You know, yeah."
3032.98,3033.98, Exactly.
3033.98,3034.98," Well, yeah."
3034.98,3035.98, Okay.
3035.98,3036.98, That's right.
3036.98,3037.98, That's stuff there.
3037.98,3039.98," Number one, month after month after month."
3039.98,3040.98, Yeah.
3040.98,3042.98, Except the Sims is actually kind of good.
3042.98,3043.98, Yeah.
3043.98,3045.98," I mean, we just have the Sims worth."
3045.98,3046.98, Yeah.
3046.98,3049.98, The deer hunter game to that whole deer hunting phenomenon.
3049.98,3053.98," That was back in the one side, like the late 90s."
3053.98,3054.98, Something like that.
3054.98,3055.98, Yeah.
3055.98,3058.22, Target was selling deer hunting games and they were like at the top of the list and all the
3058.22,3059.98," critics are going, what the hell?"
3059.98,3062.98," I mean, instances like that are more anomalous in our industry than."
3062.98,3063.98, Yeah.
3063.98,3064.98, But they're there.
3064.98,3069.58," You know, I mean, like I've reviewed, you know, when I was at EGIMS so many like dirt biking"
3069.58,3070.58, games and stuff.
3070.58,3071.58, Yeah.
3071.58,3072.58, It's not the wrong way.
3072.58,3073.58," I mean, that's totally fun."
3073.58,3075.1, It's fun in the real life and it makes for a fun game.
3075.1,3079.18, But the way that the game is very clearly marketed for someone who lives and
3079.18,3082.38, breeze that or like doing the majority of their shopping at Walmart.
3082.38,3083.38, That sounds pretty snuff.
3083.38,3085.38, It's for comedy.
3085.38,3089.22," Someone doesn't enjoy either shopping at Walmart, which means they wear it."
3089.22,3090.22, I think.
3090.22,3093.18," But purple, which means they don't like just joking."
3093.18,3094.18, Yeah.
3094.18,3096.18," You know, it's a game when it starts off like, yeah, how?"
3096.18,3099.18, You're supposed to put it that way.
3099.18,3101.18, Let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let
3101.18,3102.18, that you know.
3102.18,3103.18, Yeah.
3103.18,3104.18, Ternesh it up.
3104.18,3109.18," Well, there's that one particular where you win girlfriend's that was the perk and as you"
3109.18,3113.4199999999996," progress in your career and become like a superstar mode across guy, you know, the whole"
3113.4199999999996,3118.4199999999996, like aspirational lifestyle shit where like it was all about MTV cribs and stuff.
3118.4199999999996,3119.4199999999996," Like, yeah, we got it."
3119.4199999999996,3120.4199999999996, We got to have money.
3120.4199999999996,3121.94," We got to have, you know, we got to have all this."
3121.94,3124.7000000000003, We got to have these like multi million dollar houses where there's not a single book.
3124.7000000000003,3127.1," And it's yeah, I told you on that snob."
3127.1,3131.7000000000003, And taking that to a video game and saying eventually you start with the most jacked
3131.7000000000003,3134.14," buck to like, pimple faced."
3134.14,3136.26, But chick ever.
3136.26,3137.7400000000002," And so yeah, that's totally bad."
3137.7400000000002,3139.54," It's totally, you know, it's still the events."
3139.54,3141.54, But then the next one gets a little better.
3141.54,3144.02," And it starts working the way up the like, would you hate it line?"
3144.02,3146.94," You know, and so like, and everyone's like, yeah, I hate it."
3146.94,3148.94, And that's it.
3149.9,3153.38," Does it someone someone has to remind me of the name that game that I reviewed,"
3153.38,3153.78, but forgot.
3155.54,3159.3, I was pretty excited when I got to that when you got to hit it.
3159.3,3163.9," Yeah, they leave you boys, no messages on your on your they did fake answer machine."
3163.9,3164.18, Really.
3164.9,3168.46," Yeah, Sean, you know, it's not personalized like that video."
3168.46,3172.58," Just be like, it was nasty, actually, because when you, this is a classic G"
3172.58,3174.3," WD tour, but I love it."
3175.1800000000003,3178.5," When you would actually start losing races, you would go back."
3178.6600000000003,3182.1000000000004," So like you could, you think you start at rock bottom, but you don't like if you"
3182.1000000000004,3184.6200000000003," fail the first few races, you end up with that chick's mom."
3185.46,3187.1800000000003," Oh, and then she starts sending you messages."
3187.1800000000003,3188.1000000000004, So that's kind of funny.
3188.1000000000004,3188.82, That's pretty bad.
3188.94,3191.2200000000003," That's kind of yeah, but it was like, yes, that's not too offensive."
3191.2200000000003,3192.6600000000003, Jerry's bring your feet out gamers.
3193.26,3193.98, Not really.
3196.34,3200.98," Okay, so the point of that put it put us back on track is that yeah, there are some"
3200.98,3202.94, equivalents to kangaroo jack and gaming.
3203.3,3206.02," And I think that's there, you know, I mean, what, who was it?"
3206.02,3208.26," You know, this is again, you know, at this point now, I'm going to take"
3208.26,3213.06," from the scape as to some, some developer could have been Warren Spectre said"
3213.06,3216.38, that basically all gamers want is Zelda.
3216.38,3221.38," They want every game to be the legend of Zelda, yeah, which would be, which"
3221.38,3223.86," would just indicate, yeah, a certain quality to it."
3223.86,3228.14," You know, he men in terms of quality, not in terms of actual game play, but no,"
3228.14,3232.1," the quality and just, you know, that much that much put into his right."
3232.1,3236.18," The variety of game play, the, you know, this, the way that soundtrack works and all"
3236.18,3240.7," that other stuff, you know, but, but also there's just take it into the broadest sense."
3240.7,3248.22," It's just whatever, usually in the final quality, it is about Zelda that makes it"
3248.22,3249.22, spatial.
3249.22,3250.22, It's fascinating.
3250.22,3251.22, Gaming good.
3251.22,3253.22," The one that I just said, I have to find one."
3253.22,3254.22, I'm not.
3254.58,3258.74," And then for all of the, you know, things that sell really well, the critics hate"
3258.74,3261.7," there's the flip side, you know, you're got your upcoming, which, right."
3261.7,3264.58," If, if, if they're really, which is one of the one that's really Zelda."
3264.58,3265.58," Well, yeah, exactly."
3265.58,3268.54, If it was a one-to-work one correlation that would have been like the best selling
3268.54,3270.14," game last year, and obviously it wasn't."
3270.14,3271.14," Yeah, they have good point."
3271.14,3272.14, It's a good job.
3272.14,3273.14," Yeah, it's a funny game."
3273.14,3274.14, It's a funny game.
3274.14,3277.8199999999997," So yeah, we could do this a lot, a lot of those games."
3277.8199999999997,3278.8199999999997, Yeah.
3279.82,3286.6600000000003," And I think to there's just a, I mean, like, maybe it's just the nature of the medium,"
3286.6600000000003,3291.6200000000003," too, you know, I mean, if a game is going to be fun and entertaining, like, it's just,"
3291.6200000000003,3297.2200000000003," maybe that's like a finer spectrum than for a movie, where you can have, like, the most"
3297.2200000000003,3300.7400000000002," miserable ostensibly miserable experience you've ever had, like, God."
3300.7400000000002,3301.7400000000002, It's so enjoyable.
3301.7400000000002,3302.7400000000002," Like, roughly in for a dream or something."
3302.7400000000002,3306.3," And then someone is still going to say, oh, that was wonderful."
3306.3,3307.3, Right.
3307.3,3308.3," You know, Charles List."
3308.54,3311.82," Yeah, and then on the opposite side, the fun to the spectrum, you'd have, like, air"
3311.82,3314.46," plan or something, you know, we certainly don't have that of games."
3314.46,3317.98," I mean, for there's certain things that it's almost like all games have to do."
3318.34,3319.9, Maybe that would be worth looking into.
3319.9,3322.54," I mean, just like thinking about what is it that each game might be."
3322.54,3324.98," It's right that, you know, I mean, that's an idea."
3325.98,3327.82," Would we want us to, through that's a great question."
3327.82,3330.82, Would we want us to through a 40 hour recon for a dream?
3332.42,3334.6600000000003," The closest we come is our games, like, uh,"
3334.66,3335.74," like, you know, or some stuff."
3335.74,3336.22, Yeah.
3336.22,3336.42, Yeah.
3336.42,3336.58, Yeah.
3336.58,3337.06, It's like that one.
3337.06,3340.3799999999997," The lemon is clearly like, it's got some really janky control problems."
3340.3799999999997,3344.14," But you still play through it because like, there's some disturbing craft going on."
3344.14,3344.66, Yeah.
3344.66,3345.66, You can go through it.
3345.66,3346.94," And you're enjoying it on that, like,"
3346.94,3348.58, did you guys ever play sanitarium?
3348.58,3350.06, And that was kind of game actually.
3350.06,3352.7799999999997," It's funny that you point that out because, uh,"
3352.7799999999997,3353.7799999999997, condemned.
3353.7799999999997,3357.98, And so far as games like ever really polarized game reviewers was one that did.
3357.98,3361.62," I mean, I think even in EGM spread, there was a difference between, like,"
3361.7799999999997,3365.5," uh, it might have been on as little as 4.5 and then they enter something, you know,"
3365.5,3368.42," so that's a good example of, uh, of that."
3369.14,3371.22," Um, mostly horror games right now for."
3371.22,3371.58, Yeah.
3371.58,3373.14," We need to like, I'm all on that now."
3373.14,3375.8599999999997," This, this, you know, I think I have a schedule to do it this week when I'm"
3375.8599999999997,3378.7799999999997," a misdoubt, but I'm going to go on EGM next week and talk about darkness."
3378.7799999999997,3380.8199999999997," Because that, that is another game doing that."
3380.8199999999997,3384.7799999999997," I'm all so far in, and Michael Donohan over there just takes it can't stand it."
3384.98,3388.8199999999997," It's not realistic back to the old, uh, scorpion and the standoff at the,"
3388.82,3389.82," the f***, did shit."
3389.82,3390.82, Karel.
3390.82,3391.82," Realistic, really."
3391.82,3395.82," He was all mad because he had to, you know, like, comic book."
3395.82,3398.82," He was, he was all mad because, well, yeah, I mean, all technicals,"
3398.82,3402.34," it's not just a game of technicals and you're in control of little, you know, so what the"
3402.34,3403.34, radicals should realistic.
3403.34,3407.26," No, but he was specifically upset because, you know, rather he wants the game to"
3407.26,3411.9, have flashing arrows on the ground more or less that indicate where to go.
3411.9,3417.2200000000003," Uh, I, I, I, I, I, I, I honestly believe it, it's disturbing for him to play a game in"
3417.22,3423.4599999999996," that perspective, you know, first person that gives you any kind of option whatsoever."
3423.4599999999996,3428.2599999999998," And so when it's like, you know, at the very beginning of the game, this isn't a spoiler,"
3428.2599999999998,3430.1," and if you think it's a spoiler, you're done."
3430.1,3435.8999999999996," But, uh, you need to find your girlfriend's house and the game communicates that to you in any"
3435.8999999999996,3436.8999999999996, number of ways.
3436.8999999999996,3441.1," And if you find yourself getting lost, you can call her."
3441.1,3444.8999999999996," You can go, you're in the subway, you can go to the information, kiosk, and they'll"
3444.9,3449.02," tell you like, and you know, it's not realistic because of course you're in a subway."
3449.02,3450.78," I mean, it, it lets you feel in the blank."
3450.78,3453.42," So if you told me the tendon at subway, here's the address."
3453.42,3455.42," I know the address, can you tell me how to get there?"
3455.42,3457.38," But instead, you just say, hey, where's Jenny's house?"
3457.38,3458.38, Okay.
3458.38,3462.02," And then they tell you, hey, make a left and then, you know, turn right on the next one."
3462.02,3469.1," But so for me, that, that part of the game is actually really fun because, not, not just"
3469.1,3472.54, on someone because I just like following directions to get to a place like the greatest
3472.54,3475.98," thing for me ever, is for you to send me on like a scavenger hunt in the city."
3475.98,3479.86," But because in the greater context of the game and everything that's happening, so rather"
3479.86,3483.74, than just feeling like all I'm doing is ripping hearts out with demon tentacles and eating
3483.74,3488.86," them to become like, you know, ever more strong and demonic."
3488.86,3489.86, There's something going on.
3489.86,3491.82, I have a relationship with a woman.
3491.82,3494.5, There's a place and I can navigate around it.
3494.5,3495.86, There's other people around.
3495.86,3500.5," And while these, you know, curtains fall down to various degrees at various points, I appreciate"
3500.5,3501.5, that was there.
3501.5,3505.3," The thing is, in this specific example, it's very, very easy to find her house."
3505.3,3506.3, Yeah.
3506.3,3507.98," Well, absolutely what the woman says and it's right there."
3507.98,3510.14," And for him, he's like, fuck it."
3510.14,3514.38, I don't want to have to look away around this map and try to find this shit and that's
3514.38,3515.38, not realistic.
3515.38,3516.94," You know, that's not realistic."
3516.94,3521.42," And it's just because like, when I played that part, I totally, this kind of old"
3521.42,3522.66," stigma, I'm wearing the directions."
3522.66,3524.06," And then I got a slide to go, look around."
3524.06,3525.46," And I've got, you know, I got lost."
3525.46,3529.14," I'm walking around just shooting everything, just turning random corners because I was kind"
3529.14,3530.14, of playing it like a linear FPS.
3530.14,3532.3799999999997," And that was, I was talking to all the people in the subway."
3532.3799999999997,3534.3799999999997," Yeah, it was all random training missions for me to go."
3534.3799999999997,3537.46," Okay, this is not a linear straightforward thing."
3537.46,3538.98, So I'm going to think a little differently.
3538.98,3539.98, And I thought it was cool.
3539.98,3540.98, There's a submission.
3540.98,3542.58, There's the guy who wants to play his harmonica.
3542.58,3545.3799999999997, So it'll be the shit out of the bum that wants to play his harmonica.
3545.3799999999997,3546.3799999999997, You talk to him.
3546.3799999999997,3547.58," And if you want, you can go work on that."
3547.58,3550.66," Very much like, ridic, you know, what's I liked."
3550.66,3552.18, And this was the interesting thing about this game.
3552.18,3559.46," Now, we're, we'll have to say, this is really relevant to GFW radio because for, for, we"
3559.46,3564.2200000000003, hope Starbreeze might break it over to PC with the director's cut edition.
3564.2200000000003,3567.7400000000002, That's got commentary in what not.
3567.7400000000002,3571.54," But so, you know, both games, they're like in so many ways with the one way that's"
3571.54,3576.5," interesting that makes them similar is that you take a dumb license, you know, rating."
3576.5,3578.5, And you make it a good game.
3578.5,3583.5," And then you take a stupid comic book from a former, you know, the original image"
3583.5,3584.5, team.
3584.5,3586.2200000000003, And he made Topca afterward.
3586.22,3589.8999999999996," And with just shit art and just the dumbass sounding concept, ever."
3589.8999999999996,3591.54," And then they, they take it so seriously."
3591.54,3594.06," They're like, we're going to make, we're going to make something good out of this."
3594.06,3595.06, Right.
3595.06,3596.1," So I don't know if it's, they just have bad taste."
3596.1,3599.8199999999997," And they're, their ability, like, is superior to their taste."
3599.8199999999997,3601.2999999999997, And they're able to turn things into something.
3601.2999999999997,3602.2999999999997, Or if they almost like the challenge.
3602.2999999999997,3603.2999999999997, Maybe it's a challenge.
3603.2999999999997,3604.2999999999997, Yeah.
3604.2999999999997,3605.2999999999997, Or they like the challenge.
3605.2999999999997,3606.8999999999996," We're like, we're going to turn pieces of shit into gold, you know?"
3606.8999999999996,3607.8999999999996, Uh-huh.
3607.8999999999996,3608.8999999999996, You're going to like and fucking riddic.
3608.8999999999996,3611.8999999999996, So what they should do next was the according to gym game.
3611.8999999999996,3612.8999999999996, Yeah.
3612.94,3617.46, And then we're going to be talking about immersive according to gym can be.
3617.46,3619.46, Do the impulse game.
3619.46,3620.46, That's a hell.
3620.46,3621.46, That's the flash.
3621.46,3622.46, Come.
3622.46,3623.46, Yeah.
3623.46,3626.26, But the darkness is like a game of moments for me because like even like simple things
3626.26,3628.1800000000003, like sitting on the couch and like watching to get on the couch.
3628.1800000000003,3629.5, That's the coolest thing in that game.
3629.5,3630.9," I'm just like, oh my god."
3630.9,3633.78," Can I really just sit here and watch to kill him, I'm talking bird and it's entirety."
3633.78,3635.58, Or the fact that I wanted to sit down.
3635.58,3639.34," Everyone I talked to, um, the affiliate, quickly the first time you go to your girlfriend's"
3639.34,3640.34, house.
3640.34,3642.2200000000003," She's, you know, she's very happy to see you."
3642.22,3643.22, She wants you to hang out.
3643.22,3645.7799999999997, You have the choice to tell her about what's really happening in the world.
3645.7799999999997,3649.58, I won't spoil that or you have the choice to just sort of like keep her blissfully ignorant.
3649.58,3651.1, She wants you to spend the evening with her.
3651.1,3652.1, You don't have to.
3652.1,3653.5, You can walk out the door and go to your stuff.
3653.5,3658.06," But the acting, the performance is done so well."
3658.06,3662.8199999999997, And even though despite the imperfections and graphics technology and stuff and in the fact
3662.8199999999997,3667.8199999999997," that we know she'll look like a horrible mutant in a year from now, um, like you're like,"
3667.8199999999997,3672.1," I care enough about this similar career to want to like, to sit down with their"
3672.1,3673.1," firm in, you know."
3673.1,3675.2999999999997," So it's like, hey, I had to go do the dishes anyway."
3675.2999999999997,3677.8199999999997," So it's like I sat down with her and left it there and I'm like, I'm going to go do the"
3677.8199999999997,3679.86, dishes for one because I felt I should.
3679.86,3681.8199999999997, But then I wanted to see what happened.
3681.8199999999997,3684.8199999999997, I wanted to see what happened when the TV ran like if there's some kind of Easter egg
3684.8199999999997,3686.58, when the movie ended or something.
3686.58,3689.86," If, how they would handle it, you know, and it's interesting and you're sitting there"
3689.86,3693.94," in first person and you're at the various times, you might hold her hand, you know, she"
3693.94,3696.02," leans in, you put your arm around her shoulder and stuff."
3696.02,3698.1, And this is all very cool stuff.
3698.1,3700.62, So it's not the reason to buy the game.
3700.7,3705.1, These things are are placed in the context of a game where your blowing dudes away and
3705.1,3707.7," eating their hearts out and all this other kind of stuff, too."
3707.7,3711.3399999999997, So it makes it a well-rounded and I think ultimately interesting game.
3711.3399999999997,3715.14," The thing is though, it's like, Madonna was just having none of it."
3715.14,3716.54, The thing was the realism.
3716.54,3718.74, I'm basically now ruining the debate I have with them.
3718.74,3719.98, I'm just giving it everything away.
3719.98,3721.14," But he's like, I have him on his head."
3721.14,3722.14, He was all in the side.
3722.14,3723.14," Yeah, he could find him right now."
3723.14,3727.3399999999997," But he's all like into a, you know, like, hotel dust can stuff and he was like,"
3727.3399999999997,3728.3399999999997, that's not a puzzle.
3728.3399999999997,3730.3399999999997," I had to find someone down the street and was like, oh, yeah."
3730.78,3733.78, Just play hotel dust where there's a literal five piece jigsaw puzzle.
3733.78,3735.58, You put together to figure out how to go down the street.
3735.58,3736.58, Fuck you!
3736.58,3737.38, Second game.
3737.38,3739.06," Yeah, that game lost me fast actually."
3740.06,3740.58, You too.
3740.58,3742.06," Uh, yeah."
3744.06,3744.7000000000003, All right.
3745.1000000000004,3746.06," Oh, good."
3746.3,3748.58, Garage band wants to do a software update suddenly.
3748.58,3750.38, Right now in the middle of our podcast.
3750.38,3751.1400000000003, Yeah.
3751.7400000000002,3753.6600000000003," Well, while you're going to edit this then, I assume."
3753.6600000000003,3753.86, Okay.
3753.86,3754.3, There we go.
3754.86,3755.06, Okay.
3755.06,3755.6600000000003, I'm fine.

3756.54,3756.98, All right.
3757.1800000000003,3757.5, Cool.
3757.5,3759.2200000000003, That would have been a bad way to start our show.
3759.4599999999996,3760.4199999999996," Yeah, already editing."
3760.4199999999996,3761.8999999999996, Learn two minutes into it.
3763.2599999999998,3766.2599999999998, So we got the usual gang of idiots here.
3766.2599999999998,3768.2599999999998," I'm Jeff Green, I don't know."

3780.74,3782.18, The secret don't talk about it.
3783.22,3784.2599999999998, So it's usual.
3784.2599999999998,3786.66, We got a lot to talk about today a lot.
3786.7799999999997,3787.7799999999997, And I'm not even kidding.

3815.6600000000003,3816.6200000000003, I'm not sure why we're going to look at Jeff Bells ongoing sort of disastrous internet appearance.
3817.2599999999998,3822.5, We're going to look at New York Times article on game criticism and we're going to critique
3822.5,3825.14, the notion of game criticism and what it's supposed to be about.
