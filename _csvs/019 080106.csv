0.0,8.040000000000001," Hello and welcome once again to the CGW radio podcast. This is the podcast for July 31st,"
8.040000000000001,15.9, 2006. I almost had 31st with a list. Well now you did and now I did great for
15.9,22.84," July 31st, 2006. I am here with the editors of Computer Gaming World Magazine and"
22.84,28.32, we have a big show today because we got hit with kind of a bombshell piece of news
28.32,34.56, there yesterday. Was it yesterday on Sunday of all days? We discovered that E3 is
34.56,41.84," going way cries. So, so there's that to talk about. We'll have our usual"
41.84,48.72, round of what you're playing. Darren is going to run us through some news bits to
48.72,55.120000000000005, inspire and educate you and we're going to have some reader mail including
55.12,60.919999999999995, one very special letter being read by our very special friend Ralphie who's
60.919999999999995,68.28, going to be joining us later on. So that said I am here with the editors of CGW some
68.28,74.32, of which include Brian Scott. Darren Gladstone. Sean Elliott. Sean Maloy. Hello
74.32,79.0, gentlemen. Hello. Ryan the kids want you to talk more this week. There wasn't enough
79.0,86.0, Ryan last week I think. That was your cue to say something. That's my response.
86.0,91.68, Okay. That's going to go well. Fans of Ryan you have to yell louder to him as he's
91.68,96.03999999999999, being stubborn. He's got some big news this week. He doesn't want to talk about it.
96.03999999999999,101.03999999999999, We don't talk about people's personal lives. Sean. That was your
101.03999999999999,106.0, conversation. I'll talk about something different. Is he on line character?
106.0,116.68, Can now fly at class B space for it. I got big news. I got these sexy new Italian leather
116.68,121.0, motorcycle boots on. Aren't I hotter? That is too hot.
121.0,127.92, You feel nervous for a second. I'm just thankful that you actually have a motorcycle to justify
127.92,135.16, buying those. Yeah. Well it runs on rubber bands. Still. That was like a
135.24,138.88, post-murder go striker. No insider.
138.88,144.24, All right. We're going to start off with what you're playing. I didn't play anything
144.24,149.56, personally because I was down in LA. I think my freaking family will speak. Love you mom.
149.56,156.8," Ryan, what were you playing? I played. Some more even online. Still got the love."
156.8,161.4, And my character is indeed. What are flying? What do you say? A class B for it.
161.48000000000002,167.64000000000001, Yeah. Good guess. Wow. So that's three weeks on this game. So far. I think it's
167.64000000000001,172.44, your beyond the experimentation phase. So I officially hooked. Are you enjoying progress?
172.44,177.64000000000001, I started going steady now. You ain't. All right. Now I'm meeting me and one of my buddies
177.64000000000001,183.48000000000002, from the C.W. Forum have like a mining operation going which is about as exciting as it
183.56,192.67999999999998," sounds. But is it like, you know, netting you cool, loot or money? We made a little"
192.67999999999998,198.83999999999997, bit of money over the weekend. So I got to jump back on and I kind of disappeared for a couple
198.83999999999997,202.44, days. So is this business like your main game right now? Right now. Yeah.
202.44,205.95999999999998, Is your style of guild version for a while? I haven't played guild wars since I started playing.
205.95999999999998,210.67999999999998, Wow. Wow. This is the game that kicked Ryan's Guild Wars habits. Until the next expansion comes
211.64000000000001,217.8, that should be on the eve online box. You know. Ryan Scott says the game that made me stop playing guild
217.8,225.8, wars. Awesome. And there's your free advertisement. Darren. You. It was an awesome weekend. I had to go
225.8,230.68, I went what what a rafting. So I didn't get much chance to play games. What's that? Outdoors. Oxygen.
230.68,239.08, Out sunlight. But I played that game and David Buster. Two minutes got the big like paddle.
239.16000000000003,244.84," Yeah. I don't know. No, but no, actually, but I have been playing a lot of back on the free"
244.84,249.24, where kick. And my one thing I actually have to remember now they're listening. You got to check out
249.24,254.76000000000002, this game called the blob. It's 100 mega download. It's kind of like caught a maridamasi. Ish.
254.76000000000002,259.0, But it's totally free. It's worth checking out. The little bit of mario sunshine through.
259.0,263.96000000000004," Just a little bit. What's the uh, Earl? You are outside. It's one of those obscure things."
264.52,269.0, Just I don't I don't have a URL handy. Just Google freeware. Google freeware game at the
269.0,271.79999999999995," blob. That won't turn up any porn. Well, I."
273.08,277.88," Now, I'm fortunate. If it does, I don't want to know what you've got like here. I don't want to show"
277.88,288.28, it up on the other block all BBW sites. Build your turn. Okay. Mr. Elliott. Are you playing anything these days?
288.35999999999996,294.28, I'm back to BF2 again. Just been polishing up my helicopter pilot skills. I play with it.
294.28,299.79999999999995, Real good gunner. And we just work on the TV missile coordination. It's stuff. Take out jets with it.
299.79999999999995,304.44, And this net. How many hours you have to at this point? I think we probably just passed over 500
304.44,309.32," now. Wow. And it's like I mean, we have some people are our forms. We're just talking about how much"
309.32,313.64, they hate about the game. And it's so true. It's like I hate the game or anything but I love it more
313.71999999999997,318.91999999999996," and anything. It's like a fun of full year. And for all the complaining, it's just still because I"
318.91999999999996,323.71999999999997, only complain because I care so much about it. I really don't remember about the original battlefield
323.71999999999997,329.32," 1942 getting this much complaints though all the time. Oh, it did. There were so many matches on it."
329.32,333.4," Yeah, I mean, you would have had to follow it. But there were so many patches. And it was like,"
333.4,338.91999999999996," when they patched out initial things like, you know, see for the jeep. So you could get them to launch"
339.32,342.84, far enough to practically get you out to the carriers and stuff. And it was like the end of the world
342.84,347.08," for some people, you know, it's kind of the same stuff you get in any hard core multiplayer game."
347.08,351.23999999999995," Like, yeah, that's where the parameters for strafe jumping or body hopping and team for"
351.23999999999995,355.79999999999995, yours and Valdez. A lot of guys that spend all their time working on those skills and finally
355.79999999999995,361.71999999999997," develop them and say, it's over. It's done. So I mean, there's always that. But I do wonder,"
362.35999999999996,366.2," you know, actually, I can't say one of the persistent problems with the A2 now is still"
366.2,371.47999999999996," the server browser and whatnot. And that was I think that's just not dice as strong suit. I mean,"
371.56,375.16, it was horrible and it's still horrible and 42. What about that? I don't know.
375.16,379.64000000000004," I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The water is great. Uh, and we're now there's"
380.36,384.52000000000004," a 1.4 patch coming out for Battlefield 2. And unfortunately, they have to do their own side,"
384.52000000000004,389.24," they're on work on their side to to keep up with the patches. And as of now, I don't think they're caught"
389.24,393.96000000000004, up. So that's too long. I think I think they didn't even bother with 1.3 because as
393.96000000000004,398.68," somebody persistent crash bugs, but maybe 1.4 comes out any day now. The beta's already out."
398.68,401.96, And you can get it on file front if you guys want to. I wonder if the days guys are talking to the
401.96,405.8," auto loader guys because it just seems like that's a much better interface. Yeah, they're well aware of the"
405.8,411.88," problem. I mean, one of the big things that they keep underscoring for 2042 is that hey, the server browser"
411.88,415.96000000000004," 600 times faster, you can have friends list. You can have favorites. All the things you expect,"
415.96000000000004,421.4," but it's really odd to think that there's a game, an entirely multiplayer game like Battlefield 2 in"
421.4,427.64," 2005, 2006, and it doesn't even have a friend's list. It doesn't have that's all the insight. That's just"
427.64,434.91999999999996," insane when you can get that stuff on Yahoo, Messin. Yeah, and in any console game where it's"
434.91999999999996,439.0, it's clearly the multiplayer's and afterthought or something thrown into to fill up the last few
439.0,444.84," months of development cycle. But I mean, this is a game that's all about that. And it doesn't have a"
444.84,450.03999999999996, friend's list. So dumb. But so they know they're they insist they're working on it. So hopefully from
450.03999999999996,455.71999999999997," this will be the last sort of being a 12 on the 32. Yeah, right. So the bombers that you have to play"
455.8,463.96000000000004," 2142. Oh, burn. Oh, and here I thought I was, I thought I was going to be mean saying"
463.96000000000004,470.28000000000003," at 600 times better than nothing and still nothing, but oh, you're out. Oh, it's from a lie."
471.16,476.68," I'm actually playing the movies. Really? Yeah, I stole it from Ryan's office and"
476.68,481.0," because expansion pack. Yeah, Sean's office for a lecture the week for a way to go. Yeah. Yeah."
481.0,484.52000000000004, So what do you make in what movies you make? Haven't made any movie. I'm just doing the simulation
484.59999999999997,490.2," part now. That's like the bad part. Yeah, this kind of boring. Like I've been playing it and going"
491.4,495.88, it kind of plays itself almost. Like there's no question about what you should be doing next
495.88,500.44," to just like, oh, okay, now I lay down this building because I need this building next. So I just"
500.44,504.52," got the building that lets you make your own scripts, which is the, you know, the part I was kind of"
504.52,508.59999999999997," interested in because I watched a couple on the lying pit site that were kind of cool. Like,"
508.59999999999997,513.0," you know, oh, I didn't know a video game could actually do this kind of thing kind of way."
513.0,516.12," Yeah, you ever get a, you ever get tempted to like look for hacks online so you could just"
516.12,522.92," unlock all the stuff and create your own movies. Um, I probably will see enough. I definitely need that."
522.92,527.56," Especially if you want to go in and just use it as a tool to create stuff. Yeah, because if I right now"
527.56,531.4," got to, well, there might be a free play mode or something like that. Well, I think the same box mode."
531.4,533.48," I think the, I think the, I think the, I think the, I think the sandbox mode works if you want to just"
533.48,537.4, make movies is that you have to actually like unlock some of the stuff in the sink in the sim game.
537.4,542.04," I just don't have to do that. Peter. And if we're getting this wrong, neither Darren nor I reviewed the"
542.12,552.4399999999999," game. So don't you know this. We, they guy you did. I don't know. I don't know why I didn't play that one."
552.4399999999999,557.0, Because it sounds so fun to make the movie making part. It's been on my like to play list for a while.
557.0,562.52," So I finally just said, I'm going to steal it and play. Yeah. So you should post your, your movie online."
562.52,568.04," All right, everyone is a real awesome kind of apathy or something that like that might prohibit the,"
568.04,574.12," the, you know, that sort of thing in those games. So I was thinking like Battlefield 2's got the, the BF2 TV recorder."
574.12,578.76," Right. And I think of how every time I play like, yeah, we should record this. We should record this."
578.76,583.16, It's like you just never do the same thing. It's one of a lot of people play like the movies and stuff.
583.16,587.24," And I got what we could do this and we could do that. And then they just, that's just for whatever reason."
587.24,591.0," Well, it's even a lot of clips out there. Yeah, there definitely are. But I mean,"
591.24,597.0," probably should be a lot more, right? Yeah. Well, it's the movie making part of it seems so disconnected"
597.24,602.6," from the actual game. At least the little I've played of it. It's just like, okay, I know I got the"
602.6,607.8, custom script off as but not really have to use it. So it's like completely different part of the game.
607.8,611.72," It's like separate. Yeah. Game rendering. And I'm wondering how like the quote critics,"
611.72,617.24," unquote, like that review, the game, you know, the movies within the game, like, judge you,"
617.24,621.64," like, because you make money based on how good the movies are. Hopefully, they're a little more"
621.72,628.6, professional than game critics. So it's just how much. Yeah. All right. Yeah. The more props you've got in
628.6,633.64," your. Yeah. Yeah. Which is just a higher your score. Yeah. I don't wonder if they'd like to know, like, if you're"
633.64,638.1999999999999," connecting different scenes correctly, could you send them shot cheese and stuff in like the game coming"
638.1999999999999,644.28," to do with this? There's a, I haven't built the PR. It's my movie clip and here's a fantastic sword that"
644.28,650.84," says, you know, Guild Wars on it. Here's a PR. And then I played some while."
651.64,657.72," Some while. Yeah. Of course. And back in the world. Yeah. Just for taste. Every time there's a new,"
657.72,663.64," like controversial patch or whatever announcement, I always, it always makes me play again. We didn't"
663.64,671.48," pull back in. Pull back in. Let's get my infernal pet. Oh, we still need to have our office lunch game"
671.48,675.48," with the ship. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they haven't done that. Yeah. What have I read? Just come"
675.48,680.84," out. I'm going to do it. But you do it. I'll do that when I get back from the, you know, executive"
680.84,686.2," boom doggle in Napa. All right. Well, you pians are still working. I've got you in the line, by the way."
687.4,693.16," Huh, even I've got the shit. Yeah. I downloaded it. So we all have it now. We just have. I'm so ready to go."
693.16,698.2, We got communication problems here. We all have this game and we haven't played it together.
698.2,703.08," Hey, it was hard to say. You, you and Darren on, on land to play prey. Well, I pray."
705.48,711.5600000000001," You know, that was kind of fun to multi prey. Yeah. It was fun. Except for you. You were"
711.5600000000001,715.8000000000001," horned though. Who was horned the space coffin was Darren? Yeah. The space coffin? Yeah,"
715.8000000000001,721.48," that flying fucking, oh, yeah. I kind of would survive. Oh, hell. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"
721.5600000000001,728.6800000000001," the flying. Oh, it's a bargain. Frack it to bargain. Yeah. That thing was a seemed a little bit of a cheat."
729.5600000000001,733.4," I don't know. I mean, I was considering how few maps that are on. You know what? I was doing"
733.4,737.8, at the end there. It was I would just get into that ship and I would fly way up to the top of the
737.8,741.4," wall. I said, you know, and then you see a sign of movement and then start dropping right in hell on it."
742.1999999999999,746.52," Did you see a run in like, okay, it's also another form of lurking or camping. Yeah."
747.72,752.4399999999999," Wait, something good to take that out. You do. You need like a big like rock. You get like the"
752.4399999999999,756.6," quill and other lighting gun. You know, with the all fires, the pulling the energy sources. When you get"
756.6,761.56," the white energy flow, that it worked well on that thing. Yeah. But uh, but it's not like you've got."
761.64,766.1999999999999, It's not like the sniper rifle in that game. We'll get you a one shot one kill a hit in the
766.1999999999999,771.4799999999999," space coffin or whatever, you know, not in that thing. He's at least like lean around the corner and take it"
771.4799999999999,777.4," out and work that way. Yeah. It was fun, but I didn't really feel like going back to it. I thought it was"
777.4,781.64," pretty cool. Some of the other levels we played actually had a little, uh, had more setups where you could"
782.3599999999999,787.8, use your spirit walking power. Okay. Activate shields and whatnot and hide behind them and basically
787.88,792.8399999999999," go get a few hits in with your spirit and then pop shield. Okay. Yeah, there's some tension on there."
792.8399999999999,799.7199999999999," I am hearing that online already. It's totally a savance game. But which I mean, uh, you've got people"
799.7199999999999,805.16," that are really good and that's it. What else is like go to hell. You know, that's what online"
805.16,809.7199999999999," game isn't like that. I don't know. There's a, I don't know. I don't know. What online shooter"
809.7199999999999,816.04, like says welcome newbie. Right. We won't share. We're gonna feel for the map first. We won't
816.12,821.0," argue right. But the difference is I think you can have games where we're like, Balfa the word,"
821.0,825.8, you're not the best and you're gonna jump in and there's enough people and you can get points
825.8,830.04, doing something other than just killing someone. You might have the luck of getting in a vehicle that's
830.04,833.4," going to give you an advantage. Yeah. Say if you're sucking, you get an attack. You're at least"
833.4,836.5999999999999, going to be able to kill a few people unless you're completely combination of having enough room to
836.5999999999999,840.76," operate enough vehicles and stuff. Right. Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough, moving targets to give you a"
840.76,845.4," chance to move around a little. But in a death match game like that with that few players, you get a"
845.4,850.6," good cycle going and once you're in the lead, you've always got 200% health, 200% armor. You've"
850.6,854.4399999999999, got all the access to the best weapons. You're running a loop so you're catching them every time
854.4399999999999,859.0," they respawn and locking other players out from them. And it's like, yeah, you don't, you don't"
859.0,863.24," need to get a point for repairing some dudes truck and still feel like, hey, I'm like, a bit"
863.24,867.4," at least I accomplish something. You're like, you're just there to get, and I'm not talking about,"
867.4,870.36," I'm not bitter. It's not my own experience. It's just what I've heard and it's like, I do know"
870.36,874.68," the experience from other games where you know, you ever play quick three arena and you're on like"
875.4,880.52," one shot, one kill real gun level, right. No fall damage. And so it's nothing but rail jumping"
880.52,890.52," and like, instant gym. This does a humble you real fast. But anyhow. Okay, so we head on to events"
890.52,900.92, of the week or a week event of yesterday. The big one which started as a as a scoop by a next gen
900.92,906.28," and then it got the other sites kind of said, no, that isn't what happened and now it turns out"
906.28,913.24," that kind of is what happened, which is that that the entertainment software association ESA"
913.24,924.76," has decided to pull the plug on E3 as we know it. And that comes from, it sounds like it was a decision"
924.76,928.76," that they made in Ria. I mean, other it was different. This decision was foisted upon them"
929.08,935.24, the publishers who basically said screw this. What's it about five or six years overdue? And
935.24,941.08, and what I've been hearing is what that EA pulled out first followed by Sony and then it was a house
941.08,946.12, of cards after that. And we've been hearing this on our side of things for years now. I mean constantly
946.12,950.2," it's been nothing but complaints about diminishing returns from EA and this and that, you know,"
950.84,957.08, it costs it costs millions literally millions of dollars for a game company set up shop at this
957.1600000000001,962.44," pages of money black hole. And they feel like when they go in there, say if you're someone"
962.44,967.24," with the cloud of EA, their alternative is to have their own private precedent where they can"
967.24,970.84," control the focus, they don't have to worry about the white noise of all these other games,"
970.84,973.8000000000001," right, you know, not even competing with their own games, they could say, hey, we're just going to"
973.8000000000001,980.76," show you these five this month and then and then also who's getting the time, like say, maybe,"
980.76,984.0400000000001," you know, we've been in there and we're like, you know, we have that sense of entitlement, we're like,"
984.12,987.88," hey, we're just here to work. Let us get some time to talk to someone and get out of here. But then"
987.88,992.36," half the time, you don't know who's in there anymore. You know, it's a lot of people. It's really easy to"
992.36,999.16, sneak in and that's seriously what our anniversary that this has been of no use to us for years.
999.16,1002.8399999999999," Right. And they've had the pre, they have the pre three events anyway, even more and more."
1002.8399999999999,1007.0," It's totally pointless. I mean, a company like EA, yeah, they'd be, they spend what five million on that"
1007.0,1012.5999999999999," booth. And then after that, they're spending, they have to fly in journalists or we drive down"
1012.6,1017.88, for the day and we hang out and check out all their games. And it's just cost and time. It turns
1017.88,1021.8000000000001," it like E3, which is supposed to be like a weekend may, it turns into like a three month procedure."
1021.8000000000001,1027.16," Well, once one company started with the pre E3 thing where we're a captive audience for their,"
1027.16,1032.68," their own their games stuff, then all the other companies started to see how successful that was."
1032.68,1039.88," I think it was Microsoft, the game game stock a few years ago. And now E3 starts basically in April for us."
1040.0400000000002,1044.8400000000001," By the time E3 actually rolls around, we've seen everything that's going to be cool."
1044.8400000000001,1048.3600000000001," You know, maybe they'll hold one or two surprises off for us behind closed doors."
1048.3600000000001,1054.1200000000001," But then those are the things that we can't even write about. So, I don't know. I mean,"
1054.1200000000001,1059.0," it's, it's always a great, I mean, face it. It's great to like go down the LA and just screw around the"
1059.0,1067.72," front. Right. That part's fun. But, you know, as a practical productive event,"
1067.8,1073.72," this has got to be a real time to, to let out the sigh of relief for anyone in online media."
1073.72,1077.96," Oh, my god. Because instead of for them, they're jumping might mean being, you know, it could all"
1077.96,1082.6000000000001, happen at a big flurry of activity around that same time frame. But it's going to be stretched out.
1082.6000000000001,1086.6000000000001," Hey, two days later, there's this. Maybe next week, Activision's got something instead of the"
1086.6000000000001,1092.44," whole here three days get everyone on staff writing like gibberish, you know, the, yeah, those guys"
1092.44,1096.84," just get machines. I mean, at least we had the lecture saying, yeah, when we get back to San Francisco,"
1096.84,1100.6," we'll write this stuff up. Right. Maybe. You know, the only thing that scares me as a result of this"
1100.6,1105.48, is that some show like GDC could become the next D3. And I actually find that GDC is like the most
1105.48,1109.8," useful show where I get a chance to hang out and talk to developers. Right. But I don't think it's not,"
1109.8,1113.8, I don't know. I hope that's a great. Because that's the whole thing is the developers want to get
1113.8,1118.28," out of the, the, everyone showing their hand at once scenario. Let me show you something. It's a"
1118.28,1123.3999999999999," similar ridiculous. I, I think it's, they're, we're not going to miss it. You know, that's why"
1123.72,1129.3200000000002, and think of all the time wasted by the developers. I have to get ready for the damn show.
1129.3200000000002,1134.6000000000001," Get your E3 build ready. Yeah. That's such an invasive process. I like stopped development to like,"
1134.6000000000001,1138.76," okay, now I put together the demo. Let's polish everything up. Right. So you can actually work on the game."
1138.76,1143.64, You've got to work on the build to show the game critics at E3. So they get the best of E3 or
1143.64,1149.0800000000002, right. That's the other thing that's going to die. Just the whole notion of awards that E3. Thank God.
1149.1599999999999,1153.56," Thank God. That is so overdone for a choice show. You know, we're just like the shiniest"
1153.56,1158.6," production. It's actually all the, it's all marketing. Just another excuse to get people's labels on boxes."
1158.6,1163.1599999999999," That's all the people that I was in. That's, I was in that little committee. That little game"
1163.1599999999999,1168.4399999999998," critics committee. And I hated it at the whole time. I thought it was the biggest bogus. Yeah. You know,"
1168.4399999999998,1172.52, we had the loudest booth with the flat years demo. Yeah. It was all about just getting a box
1172.52,1176.1999999999998," quad. Right. I couldn't tell you how many times, like right after the show, people were calling me"
1176.2,1181.16," asking, okay. So when's your E3 coverage going to hit? I'm like, looking for an E3 brand in"
1181.16,1185.88," story, we wound up not doing it, which I'm really glad. We did, we did to match to be timely with the show."
1185.88,1189.32," Well, right. It was basically, yeah. It was if we had been done. It would have been two months."
1189.32,1192.6000000000001, Yeah. But I'm just so we had it. We did an opinion in a preview beforehand. Right. Like there
1192.6000000000001,1197.32, was so many other magazines. The open up any open up your game for our PC game or whatever. They
1197.32,1202.28, have these post E3 reports thing. Right. Everyone had the same feature like two months after E3.
1202.36,1207.08," Right. I didn't know the August, you know, meaning about it. Everyone has the same."
1207.08,1213.8," You know, here it is. Here's your E3 experience. And yeah. This is it. We got drunk and went to parties."
1213.8,1218.84, Yeah. Those are always fun to read. Yeah. I guess the one thing I'm kind of just looking
1218.84,1223.08," thinking back about, I was like, 12 years ago when you're sorry, playing with the Falcron,"
1223.08,1226.76," Mike, what was it like? It's a scratch. Oh, that was a story. Yeah. Sorry."
1227.0,1232.12,"勞da. Yeah. Jeff Gespraine with his new toy. No, I was rapidly quiteー just like my"
1232.12,1237.24," thoughts, like 12 years ago when they started doing and he read a record. So I'm telling"
1237.24,1241.32," the game industry thing, hey, what we really don't feel like that, reactivating stuff, and I've"
1241.32,1244.52," really seen a CES. It was like the game industry, and what the porn industry where we're put"
1244.52,1248.84, up on some other haul. Not that I mind that. I actually enjoyed that part.
1248.84,1252.12, Mine's heating up now. No more. No more working. Just didn't have that part.
1252.12,1254.28, Yeah. Wouldn't be similar. Yeah. I was still happy to say I was CES and it's got its own
1254.28,1258.28," Well, the point was like, E3 is kind of an offshoot saying, hey, we're going to do our own thing now."
1258.28,1259.28, Right.
1259.28,1262.28," And now E3, I mean, the whole point of it, then was just say, hey, we're legitimate."
1262.28,1264.28, And I think we've just established we are legitimate.
1264.28,1266.28, So the whole need for the show is a gone.
1266.28,1268.28," Yeah, that's I agree."
1268.28,1270.28," That's good point, Darren."
1270.28,1271.28, Yes.
1271.28,1272.28," Holy cow, I have a good point."
1272.28,1273.28, That held it.
1273.28,1274.28, Good for that.
1274.28,1275.28, Good for that.
1275.28,1276.28, So good read and see three.
1276.28,1282.28," It's going to, and ultimately, I think the big people that told out of it immediately in their perspective,"
1282.28,1288.28," we're going to be going to equal more meaningful coverage for them, which they see as promotional material."
1288.28,1289.28, Right.
1289.28,1293.28," So, say again, for example, like you've got, I don't know, game X."
1293.28,1301.28," And instead of showing it at E3 and having people give it the obligatory coverage just with the mentality is like, hey, if it's there, we've got to do something on it."
1301.28,1302.28, Yeah.
1302.28,1307.28," This way it comes out of time when maybe it's one of the few releases announced that week more people are going to like,"
1307.28,1311.28, and it'll be at a time when maybe there's actually really something to talk about it for.
1311.28,1314.28, Other than we saw it at the show and we saw two screens.
1314.28,1317.28, Now we can just write an article when it's relevant.
1317.28,1332.28," The hard thing for us, I think if you want to do anything that's worthwhile, neither of those scenarios either the E3 trade show or the events that are specific to the publisher are very good places for us to be journalists."
1332.28,1333.28, Right.
1333.28,1338.28, Their places to go and write promotional copy where you go and get the dog and pony show.
1338.28,1340.28, They tell you exactly what they want you to hear.
1340.28,1349.28," Everyone here has a big thanks though as opposed to us going in, you know, like if we, yeah, if we got to go in on our own time and sit down with the people for a day pick their brains."
1349.28,1358.28," Hang out with them talk to them not not be, you know, shepherd it through the turn styles and hey take five minutes on this and here in the same, you know, pre program speech that we're going to drop on everyone else."
1358.28,1360.28," So it's like, I don't know, but that's our own thing."
1360.28,1362.28, We will make make the good one tap.
1362.28,1367.28," Well, I think these if you do go on those, those day trips, let's say you go to an EA day and, you know, whatever."
1367.28,1372.28, I'm interested in you sitting in a room with 30 other journalists from different publications. I hope like personally when I sit in those meetings.
1372.28,1376.28, I don't ask the questions I want to ask because I'm not going to give my questions.
1376.28,1377.28," Yeah, there are so many."
1377.28,1380.28, You always get those great questions from the other web journals.
1380.28,1381.28, Yeah.
1381.28,1383.28, The German guys were always great.
1383.28,1385.28, How many companies are there?
1385.28,1386.28, How many levels?
1386.28,1387.28, Right.
1387.28,1391.28," Yeah, like how many types of guns do I get the shot?"
1391.28,1396.28," Or do you see the frame right there like the first thing they're like, okay, this is a look at whatever, you know, who say it was a couple years ago."
1396.28,1400.28," You teach 2007, they're like, this isn't going to be coming out for another two years."
1400.28,1401.28, First question.
1401.28,1404.28, What the frame rate is going to be when they finally come out?
1404.28,1406.28, That's the same.
1406.28,1408.28, The same is like a throning a little slow.
1408.28,1409.28, Yeah.
1409.28,1410.28, That's the thing I got to make fun of a quick.
1410.28,1417.28," Yeah, it's for fun aside because you see, there's always this comment in a preview about frame rate now and then."
1417.28,1419.28, And I think it's like this attempt.
1419.28,1422.28, This is me being a just off discreetly preview.
1422.28,1433.28," But it's an attempt of a bad writer or writer who's just being lazy to say, okay, you know what, this really does read like ad copy, but here's my chance to inject some, some criticism or something."
1433.28,1440.28," But it's as dumb as like imagine even you're reading a preview and entertainment weekly for King Kong and it's like, no on the set now."
1440.28,1449.28," Jack Blacks running around in front of this green blanket, but we have every reason to believe that when this comes out in 2006 King Kong will be behind it."
1449.28,1451.28," You know what's like, okay, shut up without the frame rate."
1451.28,1453.28," Talk about like, it looks like it does."
1453.28,1460.28," I mean, you could talk about what is this, I mean, like, you know, like maybe there's something that you're already seeing in the way that games put together that's got you worried or something."
1460.28,1468.28," You know, the design, other ideas, you know, with the, basically they're all these other entry points to if you really want to be critical about it that you can use, but right."
1468.28,1469.28," Right, right."
1469.28,1470.28, That's just like cop out.
1470.28,1475.28, It's the way to actually say you're being critical when you're looking at a preview or a way to feel like awesome.
1475.28,1479.28," The frame rates a little down, but we're sure they're going to get it together."
1479.28,1480.28, Here's hoping.
1480.28,1485.28," Yeah, they're going to get it together by that time it's released in November."
1485.28,1487.28, You can do X and Y then Z.
1487.28,1488.28, Yeah.
1488.28,1489.28, Yeah.
1489.28,1491.28, Say we're getting caddy now.
1491.28,1492.28, Yeah.
1492.28,1494.28," Yeah, he would never do that."
1494.28,1497.28," Yeah, you know what, I'm not going to add to that right now, but I'm not."
1497.28,1499.28," I'm reading through a don't say, I wouldn't even say it."
1499.28,1500.28, Don't even go.
1500.28,1501.28," All right, never mind."
1501.28,1503.28, One other last thing on the E3 thing.
1503.28,1504.28," It's like, yeah, we're definitely."
1504.28,1509.28," We're clearly not concerned about it at all other than the party week is going to be, you know, be a little different."
1509.28,1514.28," But the one thing I was like theoretically, I was talking to Sean about this earlier."
1514.28,1526.28," Sean, Lloyd, and it's just that normally, if you heard that instead of a big, widely accessible, you know, press conference type thing, you're going to have all these smaller things that are a little more exclusive and intimate."
1526.28,1532.28," You'd worry if it's a situation like, you know, Dick Cheney only offering interviews to Fox or something like that, you know."
1532.28,1551.28," But the thing is, is I think we're a lot of these, and I don't want to crap on everyone, but we're a lot of the small gaming sites and stuff like that are out there and you would say, well, maybe it's going to be more difficult for them to get information now because they're not able to just go to E3 and they're not going to be able to fly out seven times to seven different mini shows."
1551.28,1554.28," The same time, there's not so much."
1554.28,1560.28," You know, there's not, I don't, I see a lot of soft, soft stuff on the sort of soft writing on the smaller sites too."
1560.28,1569.28," You know what I'm saying? I guess it's like the difference of kind of having an exclusive press conference in blackballing like a distant or a child's gear or something like that and then opposed to like,"
1569.28,1574.28," if you're just going there to write about how everyone needs to buy this game and, you know, right, the other thing."
1574.28,1585.28," I don't know. I guess what I'm really getting to is like, let's see, I want to challenge all anyone who writes about games is to just exercise their critical muscle, you know, going there and thinking about what they're doing."
1585.28,1593.28," Actually, one of the, I just, I know this is the topic that's never going to end, but the only people who really lose out from this are the guys can catch a haul or this, the smaller development."
1593.28,1595.28," Yeah, so I want to get their stuff this day."
1595.28,1596.28," Yeah, I think that's a good point."
1596.28,1603.28," Well, the thing is the gaining exposure. I mean, right, the journalists are there to cover the big stuff and everyone takes a day down and they go down to catch a haul and they just check out."
1603.28,1611.28," I mean, I go to every, I actually, that's my first stop every year. I go to catch a haul and I look for like the underdog is the games that might come to the stage."
1611.28,1624.28," Right, because also the guy's doing it at a hard time getting our attention. Right. We're not going to go to a special day for, you know, some right. And if they tried to arrange to come into our office and they said they had a, you know, a mouse pad that that, you know, sat on top of your head and glowed."
1624.28,1629.28," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, look it. But maybe if we see it in action at Kentia, we want to see it."
1629.28,1640.28," I mean, maybe that's what the show is going to turn into. I mean, here's the spin dock, doing that. The ESA said, I'm a press release today and was saying basically, let me see, E3 is evolving into a more intimate event focused on targeted personalized meetings and activities."
1640.28,1647.28," Obviously, they didn't get much control right. They're doing damage. But it sounds like E3 is turning into Kinchah Hall. That's what it sounds like. Yeah, that's exactly it."
1647.28,1655.28," If they even have any events, which we really don't even know now. I mean, they're spin docking today, right, but, you know, this could be this."
1655.28,1659.28," Maybe like, let's take some time apart. You get before the, yeah, we're through."
1659.28,1661.28," Yeah, I think they're just a free space."
1661.28,1668.28," Right. And the month from now when they're standing inside the LA conventions center going guys, does anyone want to be here?"
1668.28,1672.28," It's like a tumble weed rolling. Right. And they'll say, okay, E3 is actually canceled."
1672.28,1676.28," And this is pretty much how a, like, Comedex died pretty much."
1676.28,1681.28," Remember. And you know, one other thing, actually, from our end of things, what it's going to mean is that Microsoft."
1681.28,1688.28," The June, you know, our psych, our magazine cycle for the 12 months kind of revolves around E3 as well, right?"
1688.28,1694.28," I mean, there's always the big covers are always sort of like December, January, but it's also June, right?"
1694.28,1700.28," Every publisher always can we get the E3 cover that'll be gone now, which is kind of liberating."
1700.28,1708.28," Could be because it's right because the publishers are always saving that stuff up and it's like, why, why, why, for instance, to like do it at this one time a year when we can like totally use these stories."
1708.28,1712.28, We'll start getting calls in January. Can we have the E3 cover?
1712.28,1716.28, I already got calls for the E3 cover. Next E3 cover.
1716.28,1717.28," Well, guess what?"
1717.28,1718.28, That's what?
1718.28,1721.28," Yeah, you can have it now."
1721.28,1723.28," Oh, yours."
1723.28,1725.28," Okay, so we've done with that topic."
1725.28,1726.28, Goodbye E3.
1726.28,1727.28, It's so long.
1727.28,1729.28," Don't worry, turn the way up."
1729.28,1730.28, Right.
1730.28,1735.28," But all the kids out there that have had the lifelong dream of going to E3, though, now it's, we just made them all cry."
1735.28,1736.28, Yeah.
1736.28,1739.28," And, you know, the first time you go for it is fun."
1739.28,1740.28, Mm-hmm.
1740.28,1741.28," I mean, it's fun every time."
1741.28,1743.28, Just the spectacle of it.
1743.28,1746.28," That part's fun, but as a useful business event."
1746.28,1748.28," Where are we going to see women, though, now?"
1748.28,1749.28, Where are we ever going to see another woman?
1749.28,1750.28," Oh, my God."
1750.28,1751.28, Do they have them on the internet?
1751.28,1752.28, I think they might.
1752.28,1753.28," Oh, I heard about that."
1753.28,1754.28, Ryan?
1754.28,1755.28, I just got to turn that BBW field.
1755.28,1757.28, I think so.
1757.28,1763.28," And you guys ever, like the last day at E3, it'll be like two o'clock, three o'clock."
1763.28,1765.28, You'll be walking out in some kiddo.
1765.28,1766.28, You're leaving?
1766.28,1767.28, Can I have your badge?
1767.28,1768.28, Is there ever happen to you guys?
1768.28,1769.28, What did you do?
1769.28,1770.28, Did you give it to them?
1770.28,1771.28, Hell no.
1771.28,1772.28," Why not, man?"
1772.28,1773.28, Cause they're all like on his wall now.
1773.28,1775.28, I had no fight to get in here.
1775.28,1776.28, I'm going to get in here.
1776.28,1779.28, I did and you're going to have to do the same.
1779.28,1782.28," I just, if it's, probably was one of those guys back in the day."
1782.28,1783.28," Go in there, kid."
1783.28,1784.28, Fighting to get in.
1784.28,1786.28, Maybe you'll get your self free bed and crout.
1786.28,1787.28, You did.
1787.28,1789.28, I worked video game retail.
1789.28,1790.28," Oh, that's right."
1790.28,1791.28, So you're getting your EJockey.
1791.28,1794.28, So you kind of like use that retailer.
1794.28,1795.28, Right.
1795.28,1799.28, Not that I don't like humanity or anything.
1799.28,1804.28, But I would always get kind of annoyed when I would see civilians in E3.
1804.28,1806.28, I don't like civilians.
1806.28,1808.28, Civilians that wash.
1808.28,1809.28, That's important.
1809.28,1810.28, There's a free sense of the show.
1810.28,1811.28, The shower would help.
1811.28,1812.28, Last year.
1812.28,1813.28, The pretense that was a trade show.
1813.28,1815.28, But there was so many non-traded people there.
1815.28,1816.28," It was just, I've seen kids."
1816.28,1820.28," I mean, what's cool about it is when you see civilians in there."
1820.28,1823.28, They look genuinely excited as opposed to the rest of us.
1823.28,1828.28," However, when you're actually trying to do your job in there, which we really do have jobs in this business."
1828.28,1832.28," And it's hard when you got, you know, eight thousand people go and,"
1832.28,1834.28," look, there's an over-medin coming out."
1834.28,1836.28," And you know, you can't get through the crowd."
1836.28,1838.28," You know what, even has our house."
1838.28,1840.28, That's a whole missing throbic.
1840.28,1842.28, It's like you're the guy that lives on the non-barid street.
1842.28,1843.28, And you're trying to get to work.
1843.28,1846.28, But then you can't because your street's full of all the lucky loose.
1846.28,1847.28, Right.
1847.28,1848.28, Check it out.
1848.28,1849.28, Yeah.
1849.28,1850.28, Even has no.
1850.28,1851.28, Yeah.
1851.28,1852.28, You know what to do?
1852.28,1853.28, Who are supposed to be there?
1853.28,1854.28, Don't act like they should.
1854.28,1856.28," There's a, there's a couple of years ago."
1856.28,1861.28," I think it was E3 2005, where I was, I was hanging out."
1861.28,1866.28," At the, the Zifdeva's booth, which was in the same, the big hall with,"
1866.28,1868.28, for Sony and Nintendo were.
1868.28,1869.28, Right.
1869.28,1871.28, And it was right before the doors opened on the first day.
1871.28,1873.28, I'm standing there.
1873.28,1874.28," And, you know, the doors open."
1874.28,1876.28, I see this flood of people.
1876.28,1878.28," Just like running, running toward me."
1878.28,1879.28, Or they all going.
1879.28,1883.28, I turned it look behind me and they're all just making a B-line for Nintendo.
1883.28,1886.28, Just running like a dinosaur chasing over something.
1886.28,1887.28, Yeah.
1887.28,1888.28," Oh, throw that out some culture."
1888.28,1889.28, That's kind of him.
1889.28,1890.28, Yeah.
1890.28,1891.28, That's a thing.
1891.28,1893.28," I know that always, that does amazed me."
1893.28,1895.28," I mean, but it's kind of a cool thing about the industry."
1895.28,1898.28," Each year, there's like a designated sort of like,"
1898.28,1899.28, douche identity badge.
1899.28,1902.28," And this last year, it was a flated label."
1902.28,1903.28, It was a flated label.
1903.28,1906.28," No, no, a bodyboard from NC, no, from WebSit."
1906.28,1907.28, WebSit.
1907.28,1908.28," It's a flated label, WebSit and bodyboard."
1908.28,1910.28, So you see people outside the convention center.
1910.28,1912.28, It's like what's LA in the summer.
1912.28,1914.28," So it's a good, you know, 90 something to grease."
1914.28,1916.28," And you know that inflatable vinyl, how hot it gets."
1916.28,1917.28, Yeah.
1917.28,1919.28, And these obese backs were already sweating.
1919.28,1922.28, And so you see them like just dripping with these things.
1922.28,1923.28, Like what are you going to do?
1923.28,1925.28, You're going to like go surfing down the escalator in the E3 thing.
1925.28,1928.28, And the year before it was the Guild Wars cape that on some people
1928.28,1930.28, looked like a napkin.
1930.28,1931.28, I'm not lying.
1931.28,1934.28," Like it was actually, there was so massive like to it made a cape."
1934.28,1938.28," What would normally be like Ryan, you could like turn it to a sleep and bag."
1938.28,1941.28, And it looked like a napkin on somebody's fools.
1941.28,1944.28," Actually, the one that I thought was like last last year's,"
1944.28,1946.28, I think was the age of cone and inflatable sword.
1946.28,1947.28, That was a good idea.
1947.28,1948.28, That was it for me.
1948.28,1952.28, Because then you see those two dumb asses like you're dueling with their inflatable sword.
1952.28,1953.28, They should send the police around there.
1953.28,1956.28," And if the moment you accept one of those, that's they just take you out like,"
1956.28,1957.28," Okay, you haven't shoot you."
1957.28,1960.28, You can actually just take out behind the conventions center.
1960.28,1962.28, I'm going to have a few mannities.
1962.28,1964.28, They try to you down.
1964.28,1966.28, They try to they trink them and then tag them.
1966.28,1969.28, And that's the bad and bad ones of the ones.
1969.28,1971.28, Don't do it again.
1971.28,1972.28, You have a freaking dark.
1972.28,1974.28, I can't leave you alone.
1974.28,1977.28, Okay.
1977.28,1979.28, So we're going to move on to Darren's news.
1979.28,1981.28, A greatly condensed Darren's news this time.
1981.28,1984.28, Wait.
1984.28,1986.28, I never mind.
1986.28,1988.28, Wow.
1988.28,1991.28, I'm speaking about the prices wrong.
1991.28,1995.28, MMO price dressing is dismissed and a Reuters report.
1995.28,1996.28, What?
1996.28,1997.28, That's right.
1997.28,1998.28, MMO players aren't gender computers.
1998.28,2000.28, They're just looking to score points.
2000.28,2003.28, So they haven't talked to us.
2004.28,2007.28," So Jeff, would you care to activate it?"
2007.28,2013.28," I was well, that's exactly the really short version version of the game."
2013.28,2016.28, You can actually let Ralphie read the Reuters comment.
2016.28,2017.28, Hey Ralphie.
2017.28,2019.28," Come on in, Ralphie."
2019.28,2021.28, I thought Ralphie was going to talk to us later.
2021.28,2022.28, He wants it.
2022.28,2031.28," When men appear as bucksome, scannily, quad emails in video games like World of Warcraft,"
2032.28,2040.28, it's more about winning than finding an outlet for a real world affinity for gender bending.
2040.28,2045.28, It has nothing to do with the exploration of sexual identity.
2045.28,2047.28," Says,"
2047.28,2050.2799999999997," Brenda, break way that's gained a developer."
2050.2799999999997,2054.2799999999997," Delved into the subject for her new book, sex and video game."
2054.2799999999997,2059.2799999999997," So again, what they said is just because I play a female with elf."
2059.28,2063.28, Does it mean that I want to be a transvestite?
2063.28,2066.28, But is that how you think that that's right?
2066.28,2068.28, Dordie want to be.
2068.28,2069.28, It's not right.
2069.28,2074.28," I know some people that do, but I just like to play it because it looks good on my screen."
2074.28,2077.28, You might have seen on the internet Google video.
2077.28,2082.28, There's a video of me and my character when my roommate caught me watching it.
2082.28,2085.28, I was a good one.
2086.28,2088.28, I've seen that one.
2088.28,2089.28, I saw that video.
2089.28,2092.28, You look like a bear's trophy.
2092.28,2094.28, You look like a kind of mad.
2094.28,2095.28, You even brought that up.
2095.28,2097.28, So they quoted you in this story?
2097.28,2099.28, They did quote me in that story.
2099.28,2101.28, What would you say?
2101.28,2105.28," Well, I said that kind of, I mean, I don't know."
2105.28,2109.28, The story was a little dog bites man kind of story.
2109.28,2113.28," I mean, yes, it was about, I mean, somehow somebody in the mainstream media said,"
2113.28,2117.28," Oh, my god, there's these online games and there's men playing them as women."
2117.28,2120.28," What's like saying, I mean, how is this new?"
2120.28,2123.28," It's like, did we all become trainees when Tomb Raider came out?"
2123.28,2124.28, Yes.
2124.28,2126.28," You know, I mean, no."
2126.28,2128.28, That was what for Halloween costume.
2128.28,2130.28, But I swear that only was one time thing.
2130.28,2131.28, Yeah.
2131.28,2134.28, My wife still likes my Lara craft outfit.
2134.28,2136.28," Yeah, I think I say that out loud."
2136.28,2137.28," Most of it's just, I think I know it."
2137.28,2141.28, You pick a girl because you're looking at the girl for the whole time you're playing.
2141.28,2143.28, So you might as well look at something you quote like.
2143.28,2144.28, Right.
2144.28,2147.28," I mean, what I said in the article was that, you know, my experience."
2147.28,2151.28, And I had written about it a long time ago in CGW was that when I played a female character
2151.28,2156.28," and ever quest to actually found that I would get, you know, like, more help on quests."
2156.28,2158.28, People would give me free stuff.
2158.28,2161.28, I'd get loot just because I looked cute.
2161.28,2165.28," So that would be, you know, that would mean that people are assuming that you are a woman,"
2165.28,2166.28, even though they're exactly.
2166.28,2167.28, Exactly.
2167.28,2168.28," Or obviously, real things."
2168.28,2169.28, That they're all men.
2169.28,2170.28, Yeah.
2170.28,2174.28, Maybe this is informing people playing that they should stop giving free stuff to the female players.
2174.28,2176.28," Well, I guess I said that in the article too."
2176.28,2182.28," So like, even though I know most of the people playing our guys, when I see a female character in a game like,"
2182.28,2186.28," wow, I think my initial gut reaction is, oh, there's a female player."
2186.28,2187.28, Mm-hmm.
2187.28,2192.28," But then if I stop and think about it, I realize now it's actually probably just another fat 40 year old guy."
2192.28,2195.28," No, so, from I, you're not to flirt with him."
2195.28,2199.28," I think the, at least the way that it summarized here,"
2199.28,2204.28," uh, Brenda Braithway's book sounds like it has a really reductive outlook on things though,"
2204.28,2212.28, because while clearly it's the case that not everyone who plays a character of the opposite gender in a game is doing it to explore.
2212.28,2215.28, They might just be doing it for cosmetic or stats reasons or something.
2215.28,2219.28," But I think, obviously, it doesn't, it doesn't necessarily have nothing to do with it,"
2219.28,2223.28," because certainly there are some people who do it, maybe they're in the other way around."
2223.28,2226.28," Maybe they're women who are like, I don't want to have to, I'm, you know, I'm objected."
2226.28,2229.28," Sure, all day long, now I get to do something, I don't have to worry about that."
2229.28,2230.28, I don't know.
2230.28,2231.28, I can do this right.
2231.28,2234.28," So it's like not saying that all, so maybe it's actually sort of a few do it."
2234.28,2237.28," Female gamers as males who are pinching my female,"
2237.28,2239.28, Elven As in games.
2239.28,2240.28, Could be a way to get back.
2240.28,2242.28," Could be so, of course."
2242.28,2243.28, I like it.
2243.28,2245.28," That's, if that's a rest, then I like it."
2245.28,2249.28," And even if you are, and I think even if you are, say you're playing a female character,"
2249.28,2251.28," and you at least note, you're like,"
2252.28,2257.28," these people seem to want me in their party little more than when I had like that dwarf tank, you know, or like,"
2257.28,2262.28," they, yeah, they're giving me a more, I mean, it's not like you're, you're doing some crazy out there stuff,"
2262.28,2266.28, but you're still doing some explore exploration of sexual identity.
2266.28,2270.28," You're least noting that like there's, there are different, you know, ways of interacting."
2270.28,2274.28," Well, I would never let on if I thought someone was like, you know, giving me stuff,"
2274.28,2275.28, because I was quote unquote female.
2275.28,2277.28," I would never say, hey, actually I'm a dude."
2277.28,2280.28," You want that, you know, you want that leather armor back?"
2281.28,2285.28," It's a poster rubber coffee, totally encourages like, yeah, Robert coffee encouraged it."
2285.28,2289.28," Don't we think that a nightmare in our spot, he can read his own book."
2289.28,2293.28," Well, what, what, and I mean, though, in ever quest with that going, I was like,"
2293.28,2299.28," guys who would come up like while I was soloing and like wanted like give me advice or help me,"
2299.28,2303.28," while I'm like fighting, you know, because a girl wouldn't know how to fight, right?"
2303.28,2307.28," Yeah, you might want to try, you know, hitting her harder there a little lady."
2307.28,2309.28," I can't have stuff, we want to try a shot."
2309.28,2312.28, Have we all created female characters and online games?
2312.28,2314.28," Yeah, I'm just around table."
2314.28,2315.28, Yeah.
2315.28,2316.28, I did in Guild Wars.
2316.28,2318.28, The chicks are hot in that game.
2318.28,2320.28," Yeah, especially that."
2320.28,2326.28," I didn't, I didn't, I didn't city of heroes because Robert had that whole, that little little"
2326.28,2327.28, women guild.
2327.28,2328.28, Yeah.
2328.28,2329.28, Yeah.
2329.28,2330.28," Ordinarily though, I don't."
2330.28,2332.28," Wait, you were right, you were in a guild called Little Women."
2332.28,2333.28, Yeah.
2333.28,2334.28, It was a super girl.
2334.28,2335.28," No, actually that was the joke."
2335.28,2336.28, I wasn't.
2336.28,2337.28," Well, it's before you showed up."
2337.28,2340.28," We didn't like, don't say we were all in the guild called Little Women, dude."
2340.28,2341.28, Okay.
2341.28,2342.28, Okay.
2342.28,2359.28," She's a pretty cool person and I mean, I don't want to, I'm just saying, I don't want to like,"
2359.28,2361.28," this her book, right, in public."
2361.28,2364.28," Well, who knows, like I said, that's just one quote from it too."
2365.28,2369.28," No, also like again, I'm not going to back down when it, when saying it has nothing to do with the"
2369.28,2371.28, exploration of sexual identity is a bit reductive.
2371.28,2379.28," I mean, like if you had other accounts like, uh, Marty for getting her name, but the, what was the name of, uh,"
2379.28,2380.28, exploring something?
2380.28,2381.28, Exploring.
2381.28,2385.28," I just, I just, I did an interview at Viewer about her book a while ago."
2385.28,2390.28," Anyway, there are several accounts in there of both women and men who were playing characters of opposite"
2391.28,2392.28, women.
2392.28,2393.28, Okay.
2393.28,2397.28," Well, it was not like, you know, gender betting in the way you're thinking of it, you know, in this"
2397.28,2400.28," world sense, they're definitely taking stuff away from it."
2400.28,2401.28, Lessons learned in this.
2401.28,2403.28, You really just don't want to carry this far.
2403.28,2405.28, You want to see what he from Galaxies?
2405.28,2406.28, No.
2406.28,2407.28, No.
2407.28,2408.28," Oh, that would apply to."
2408.28,2409.28," Yeah, absolutely."
2409.28,2413.28," Yeah, I knew, I mean, I was basically just doing it just for the heck of it, but I knew it"
2413.28,2419.28," it got into far when before I would talk about the request, I would actually dress up in some of my wife's clothing."
2419.28,2423.28," Uh, while I played and talking to Falsetto whenever she came into the room."
2423.28,2429.28," So that, that's when, you know, I knew I'd, you know, she would come in and ask Fals, okay, and I'd really, I really wish"
2429.28,2430.28, you'd leave me alone.
2430.28,2434.28," How do I look at these heels, by the way?"
2434.28,2437.28, This is just make my butt look big.
2437.28,2438.28, Right.
2438.28,2439.28, Thank you.
2439.28,2440.28, Look at the little couple of it.
2440.28,2443.28," He's ready to take off his head, said."
2443.28,2444.28, Screw this.
2444.28,2445.28, I'm fine.
2445.28,2447.28," I'll tell you, it's turned red all the sudden."
2447.28,2449.28, This is his totally.
2449.28,2452.28," So I think there were nothing in that quote is what's, yeah."
2452.28,2454.28," Yeah, I'm hanging on that one too."
2454.28,2456.28," It's kind of, yeah, it has nothing to do."
2456.28,2457.28, Right.
2457.28,2458.28, It has something.
2458.28,2460.28," There might, in some cases, there might be some."
2460.28,2463.28," The subtitle of the book by the way is, dude, it's a dude, dude."
2463.28,2464.28, He's a dude.
2464.28,2466.28, He's a dude.
2466.28,2467.28, He's a dude.
2467.28,2468.28, He's a dude.
2468.28,2469.28, Dude.
2469.28,2470.28, Dude.
2470.28,2474.28," What else do we have there, Darren?"
2474.28,2478.28," You know, I'll just, let me get really quick one here."
2478.28,2481.28," So I was just reading up on some random stuff recently and there's this,"
2481.28,2484.28," you know, after all the recent debates at how, you know,"
2484.28,2487.28, video games are evil and Congress is on a rampage.
2487.28,2491.28," Dr. Kimberly Thompson of Harvard University supposedly found it,"
2491.28,2494.28," and during an independent Allen analysis at the ERC,"
2494.28,2499.28," ESRB, didn't identify all violence in games in that."
2499.28,2501.28," According to the same, the study,"
2501.28,2504.28, Pac-Man is 64% violent.
2504.28,2505.28, Yeah.
2505.28,2506.28, So I don't know.
2506.28,2508.28," I'm just like, 64% violent."
2508.28,2511.28," Well, yeah, let me see, it celebrates obesity."
2511.28,2513.28, This guy runs around the maze eating all the time.
2513.28,2514.28, I don't know.
2514.28,2515.28, Is that violence?
2515.28,2517.28, That must be the other 30s.
2517.28,2519.28, You're eating the other ghosts.
2519.28,2520.28, Yep.
2520.28,2522.28, And the ghosts attack you.
2522.28,2523.28," Yeah, I don't even know where to go."
2523.28,2525.28, We don't know that these dots he's eating aren't alive.
2525.28,2526.28, That's true.
2526.28,2527.28, Yeah.
2527.28,2529.28," The other thing is that the ESRB, I mean, saying that the ESRB,"
2529.28,2532.28," like, doesn't identify all the violence in it."
2532.28,2535.28," Hello, it's like, I mean, we do know we've known for a long time"
2535.28,2539.28, that when they do have their panel to assess what the score of a game should be.
2539.28,2544.28, All they're reviewing is a clip of footage that the publisher has put together for this.
2544.28,2545.28, And they get a list of stuff.
2545.28,2546.28, They're not playing in a list of stuff.
2546.28,2548.28," They're not playing through on their own and seeing,"
2548.28,2553.28," you know, what does it feel like to go, say this mission is going to kill this gang member?"
2553.28,2556.28," They're not playing in saying like, what's the level of emotional investment in this scene?"
2556.28,2557.28," You know, like, right."
2558.28,2560.28, And then sometimes stuff's not matching.
2560.28,2563.28," Other times, I mean, who knows, it's just such a crap shoot anyway."
2563.28,2567.28," And in fact, if they knew the emotional investment of Pac-Man, they might have scored it even more violent."
2567.28,2569.28," Yeah, especially, right?"
2569.28,2571.28," Man, I was going to score."
2571.28,2574.28," Yeah, they clearly meet and then have a big hit."
2576.28,2579.28, So this is kind of another man bite their dog bite.
2579.28,2580.28, Exactly.
2580.28,2584.28," It's going to one of those aside from like the E3, kind of like me, the big news story of the day."
2584.28,2587.28, The other big stories to sum up are that some men play as women.
2587.28,2588.28, A lot of fine games.
2588.28,2589.28, Still handy.
2589.28,2592.28," Yes, RB rate games stupidly."
2592.28,2593.28, Wow.
2593.28,2594.28, Come to see.
2594.28,2596.28, W for your hardcore news.
2596.28,2599.28, We're not getting anybody paid attention to the ESRB anyway.
2599.28,2600.28, All right.
2600.28,2601.28, Okay.
2601.28,2605.28," And actually, well, in minor tech news, they slipped up with their scores."
2605.28,2606.28, Yeah.
2606.28,2611.28," My other tech news going off the page for a minute, but last week at a big to do in Santa Clara,"
2611.28,2614.28, they were going to have a couple of new dual core processors for a two.
2614.28,2615.28, Yeah.
2615.28,2620.28, Apparently apparently it is the veritable shit.
2620.28,2623.28, I have to check with the extreme tech guys.
2623.28,2625.28, I haven't actually had to go on with the shoot.
2625.28,2627.28, But he said veritable.
2627.28,2628.28, The veritable before he said shit.
2628.28,2630.28," So that makes it kind of like, the best."
2630.28,2631.28, Yeah.
2631.28,2632.28, It's not quite.
2632.28,2634.28," When we curse, we're classy about it."
2634.28,2635.28, Exactly.
2635.28,2637.28," So for the support, my drop from it."
2638.28,2640.28, That was like a two minutes in too.
2640.28,2641.28, So it's about.
2641.28,2643.28, I do a some worthwhile.
2643.28,2644.28, So I'll feel.
2644.28,2645.28, Yes.
2645.28,2646.28, Something like this.
2646.28,2647.28, So I could say I missed the song and dance.
2647.28,2651.28," It didn't tell last week, but I'm going to be getting the low down from Lloyd and Jason."
2651.28,2653.28, And hopefully have some performance numbers for you next week.
2653.28,2654.28, If you really give a crap.
2654.28,2655.28, Sure.
2655.28,2656.28, There really does.
2656.28,2657.28, Yeah.
2657.28,2658.28, We've got the shit.
2658.28,2659.28, Yes.
2659.28,2662.28, Let's try it on a lot of stuff and see if it has compatibility issues.
2662.28,2665.28, Because current dual core ones do.
2665.28,2670.28," Well, apparently from what I'm hearing is like, this is going to like, it's just basically leap for up."
2670.28,2673.28, Leap frogs AMD's latest right now.
2673.28,2675.28, So we'll see.
2675.28,2676.28, We'll see.
2676.28,2677.28, But we'll round the up and up.
2677.28,2678.28, So off for you next.
2678.28,2679.28, Yeah.
2679.28,2680.28, So there's actually care about speeds and feeds.
2680.28,2683.28," Well, how do you Darren spreadsheet half out?"
2683.28,2684.28, And yeah.
2684.28,2686.28, The will read you to do a couple puzzle.
2686.28,2687.28, 3D Marks.
2687.28,2688.28, Sure.
2688.28,2689.28, People can make a sandwich.
2689.28,2690.28, We've got to be in five.
2690.28,2692.28, How many is brain per second on the.
2692.28,2693.28, We're going to see you.
2693.28,2694.28, Yeah.
2694.28,2695.28, We're going to see you.
2695.28,2697.28, Yeah.
2697.28,2700.28, Originally I was selling farmer.
2700.28,2705.28, And then I moved over the dual core processors as the convention goes.
2705.28,2710.28, Seemed to be more interested in dual core than Star Trek.
2710.28,2712.28, Wow.
2712.28,2713.28, Okay.
2713.28,2715.28," Well, what was that?"
2715.28,2716.28, I'm in time to go.
2716.28,2717.28, Kind of some.
2717.28,2718.28, Watch your low here.
2718.28,2719.28, I'm going to see you.
2719.28,2721.28, You're watching the documentary trick.
2721.28,2722.28, Yeah.
2722.28,2723.28, I'm going to see you.
2723.28,2724.28, Yeah.
2724.28,2725.28, Check that.
2725.28,2726.28, It's a Star Trek part.
2726.28,2727.28, It's a set of armor.
2727.28,2728.28, Right.
2728.28,2729.28, Okay.
2729.28,2730.28," Well, we're just about to run down."
2730.28,2732.28," Oh, a raffie didn't read the letter."
2732.28,2734.28, We want raffie to come back in.
2734.28,2735.28, Yeah.
2735.28,2736.28, We have raffie.
2736.28,2737.28, We read it.
2737.28,2738.28, I'm going to respond to it.
2738.28,2739.28, Here we go.
2739.28,2740.28, All right.
2740.28,2742.28, Here's a letter from Michael.
2742.28,2746.28," Revisa from Santa Barbara, California."
2746.28,2749.28, Look at the way he says.
2749.28,2755.28," Your magazine is the best I love it, but I wanted to share with you a truly original piece"
2755.28,2756.28, of hardware.
2756.28,2759.28, I don't think you will find anywhere else.
2759.28,2761.28, And we have a picture.
2761.28,2763.28, We have it.
2763.28,2764.28, I'm not done.
2764.28,2765.28, Sorry.
2765.28,2771.0, My buddy with the stringy long ponytail and his buddies loved to play metal of a salt
2771.0,2773.28, multi-player.
2773.28,2778.28," Luckily, their hardware does not require them to buy four PCs or four consoles."
2778.28,2780.28, And four monitors.
2780.28,2782.28, Just one monitor and some wood.
2782.28,2788.28, You see this version of the game splits the action in the separate sections on the screen.
2788.28,2793.28, The problem being everyone can see what everyone else is doing.
2793.28,2798.28, This prompted my friend to invent what I'm sure is the world's first massively Woody
2798.28,2801.28, multi-player experience.
2801.28,2803.28, Basically a big blinder.
2803.28,2805.28, So no one can see when.
2805.28,2806.28," Hey, Ralphie."
2806.28,2809.28, What do you play or experience?
2809.28,2812.28, Massively Woody experience.
2812.28,2813.28, Okay.
2813.28,2814.28, So first off.
2814.28,2815.28, I look at this.
2815.28,2816.28, Okay.
2816.28,2818.28," So Miguel, the guy says he loves our magazine."
2818.28,2823.28," I'm not buying it because for one, he sending us a picture of them with a game cube."
2823.28,2828.28," I'm going to TV and look at a bunch of plywood, basically, to divide the script screen"
2828.28,2829.28, up to the camera.
2829.28,2830.28, Yeah.
2830.28,2831.28, You can't be readers don't do that.
2831.28,2832.28, And peek it on another screen.
2832.28,2836.28, One thing that's right about this is that this is definitely not the first.
2836.28,2839.28, Back when I worked it like trying to get me monthly.
2839.28,2840.28, Did console stuff.
2840.28,2842.28, We got these for the letter section like every other month.
2842.28,2845.28, This is just that they were cardboard and said a plywood because the guys weren't.
2845.28,2846.28, Right.
2846.28,2847.28, Would shop yet.
2847.28,2848.28, They're a little young.
2848.28,2852.28, So so so what we can tell since we're looking at the photo and the listeners are.
2852.28,2854.28, We should put it to TV.
2854.28,2857.28, Divide it up in the four sections with plywood.
2857.28,2858.28, Right.
2858.28,2860.28, And there's a section in the middle that tilt down.
2860.28,2864.28, You have to lay the TV to people lay beneath the TV and look up on.
2864.28,2867.28, Another guy's look up over it at their quarter.
2867.28,2869.28, The thing mirrors in there.
2869.28,2872.28, And what's rat is they the letter says Ralph you said it plays up.
2872.28,2874.28, They play metal of assault with it.
2874.28,2875.28, Which is metal of assault.
2875.28,2877.28, Sounds like a pretty cool game for a giveaway.
2877.28,2880.28," Anyway, the other red stuff out this picture will post it on our form."
2880.28,2881.28, Yeah.
2881.28,2882.28, Yeah.
2882.28,2883.28, We'll tell you.
2883.28,2884.28, On the wall.
2884.28,2886.28, There's next to the lazy boy that one guy's playing in.
2886.28,2887.28, There are pizza stains.
2887.28,2888.28, It's a grease stain.
2888.28,2889.28, We can all over the wall.
2889.28,2891.28," You know, there are some dude who really needs to shower."
2891.28,2894.28," Dude, no, I'm thinking like they got pizza."
2894.28,2896.28, And there's kettle corn chips in the foreground.
2896.28,2899.28, A little cup that looks like it's got marijuana in it.
2899.28,2901.28, And so it's like there's no napkins.
2901.28,2903.28, The dude's wiping his face on the wall.
2903.28,2906.28," Because his friends like, dude, that's my new lazy boy."
2906.28,2908.28, Do not mess that up.
2908.28,2909.28," Because he's like, right?"
2909.28,2910.28, It's like spiky.
2910.28,2911.28, It's a fairy dust in the wall.
2911.28,2912.28, Which I think you can do.
2912.28,2914.28, But what else is not worthy in here?
2914.28,2916.28," No, I think you got the major one."
2916.28,2918.28, We're only laughing because this is just a version of us.
2918.28,2919.28, Right.
2919.28,2920.28," But it's like dude, come on."
2920.28,2923.28, He was brag about this elegant solution over having to tell
2923.28,2925.28, how four computers I do tell you guys.
2925.28,2927.28, They have a six or a beer in the weed.
2927.28,2928.28, Makes it elegant.
2928.28,2930.28," But if they do it at land, whoever's house is,"
2930.28,2932.28, doesn't have to worry about Mike over here.
2932.28,2933.28, Why I've been pizza crap on the wall.
2933.28,2935.28, He can just like do it on his own wall.
2935.28,2936.28, Right.
2936.28,2939.28, This is not an argument for why he should be playing console multiplayer.
2939.28,2940.28," No, it's he's."
2940.28,2941.28, This is not.
2941.28,2943.28, This is a great advertisement for for PC.
2944.28,2945.28, Yeah.
2945.28,2948.28, And you always hear that it's just so much more intimate when
2948.28,2950.28, we're in the same room.
2950.28,2951.28, They gather.
2951.28,2952.28," But it's like, right."
2952.28,2953.28, That's what you get.
2953.28,2954.28, Right.
2954.28,2956.28," In fact, because the kids are farting, the picture doesn't catch you."
2956.28,2958.28, Everything else in that picture.
2958.28,2964.28," So really, some company like the he a could take it for a battlefield to"
2964.28,2967.28," And just post this photo and say, are you sick of this shit?"
