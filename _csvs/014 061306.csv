0.0,6.16," Hello and welcome. Once again, the C.D.W podcast. I can use the old greetings since neither"
6.16,10.84, Darren or Sean are here today to make the fun of me for saying it. So there it is. I said hello and
10.84,18.76," welcome. With me today, are two of these C.D.W. staff members all at the Mitch do some selves."
18.76,26.6," Ryan Scott and Sean Moloid. And we have a very, very special guest today. One of these stars and"
26.6,34.24," the what is your title producer? Yeah, producer of the One Up Show. Jane Pinkard. Hello and I feel"
34.24,39.92," welcome. We are most welcome. Me doing the same time. And as usual, on the mixing board over there"
39.92,48.08, is Mr Scott as not. Hey kids. Hi. So thank you both for joining us the Reduce C.D.W. staff today.
48.08,55.08," You know, Jane, you did such a great two theme songs now for The One Up Show. And we still have"
55.08,60.239999999999995," none here at C.D.W. Well, you should give me some lyrics because I'm really bad at writing"
60.239999999999995,66.12," lyrics, which you probably tell if you hear the one up. I'm so pretty much pretty repetitive."
66.12,72.03999999999999," So yeah, so send me some lyrics and you can do the music. Yeah, you know, we got a couple"
72.03999999999999,77.28," reader submissions. Oh no. Yeah, I don't want it. No, they're probably listening now and"
77.28,83.16, very nice job fellows. The one we heard today was a little odd though. Do anything a little
83.16,87.08," bit, especially because it had the little edits of your voice in there. Yeah, I didn't know"
87.08,91.2, what that was about. Wow. That's what I did with a remix. They did. They kind of did a remix
91.2,96.12," with me. You know, like, hello and welcome. Hello and welcome. Hello. Yeah. But the music was"
96.12,101.84," just kind of like what did you say? It was Ryan. It was like a, I said it was a started a little"
101.84,108.67999999999999, bit like some kind of Colombian drug dealer. Right. I hope you understand. That sounds cool.
108.76,113.72000000000001," I think you should have a contest for, you know, for it up. Yeah. That's the same song. Yeah."
113.72000000000001,118.2, It could be instrumental too. Doesn't have to have lyrics. Right. But what would what
118.2,124.28," would be fit CGW? Like, you know, like, sort of like, Transi house music or like, you know,"
124.28,131.24," ragtime. You know, what would write time for the old man exactly. Heart record, chamber music."
132.12,143.96," What would suit our crowd? Like, goodness. 60 fall crock. Okay. So we have Jane here and Jane, you"
143.96,149.96," play a lot of pleasy games. Don't you? Well, I do when I get the chance. Yeah. But I do that was definitely"
149.96,157.08," the first, you know, console that I ever had. So awesome. That's still play. You reviewed Dream"
157.16000000000003,164.68," fall for us. Yes. Or CGW. Yes. And it was a wonderful experience. Um, no, I'm not even kidding."
164.68,169.56," Because Ryan gave me that game. And I think, you know, he said, this is a pretty tight deadline."
169.56,174.44," We have to do it before E3 was right. She was going to ship. So, and we were all really busy. But"
174.44,180.20000000000002," honestly, I could not stop playing the game anyway. So I finished it and I think in about three days."
180.28,188.6," Um, the gift piece. I did have to look up a couple of things. Yeah. It's not. But, um, somebody"
188.6,197.95999999999998," had sent me the official like FAQ. Yeah. And that was very, very helpful. But it was pretty hard."
197.95999999999998,202.51999999999998," Where the, where the puzzles make sense to you mostly. Or were ones that were just like,"
202.51999999999998,207.72," sometimes when I play adventure games, if I give up and I look at the answer, I'm just like,"
207.8,211.96," I net my brain never would have made that connection, right? Right. Right. Right. There's a couple,"
211.96,217.0," there was one room I remember. I was stuck in. And I, you know, interact with every single thing."
217.0,221.8, I could and it turned out that you had to interact with the door three times. And on the third time
221.8,226.76," you would break through. That's, you know, something like that. That was hard. I didn't, I didn't know that."
226.76,231.07999999999998, Didn't give you any clues on the first and second try that it might give way or did it.
231.07999999999998,236.84," On the first try, it did not. But on the second, it did say the door seems to be"
236.84,242.04," rotted through or something like that. So it was, it, it did give you a clue. But I only tried it once,"
242.76,248.68," you know. Right. Well, once I did do that. And that's sort of some sort of vocal cue like, you know."
248.68,252.68, Right. That's always had those games on. Yeah. All adventure games.
252.68,258.28000000000003," I do like, come or not. Do like adventure, who likes adventure games? I think we all did."
258.28000000000003,263.56," Here in this room, please. And they made them one name. Very few and far between these days."
264.2,268.6," Yeah. Why is that? Why do you think that genre, which used to be like the biggest and"
268.6,272.36," you see games with like, missed and stuff? Why is that sort of gone away?"
272.36,277.64, Missing the game. Do nights. The doom came out. That's pretty much what I killed.
277.64,281.88," Yeah. It's weird because I mean, since the whole different way of using your brain. Right."
281.88,286.6," I mean, well, I think it's more and more so half life came out and put together both the"
286.6,291.96," adventure game and the first person. I totally agree with you. I do. I was playing a half,"
292.03999999999996,298.12," two episode one this week and finally I downloaded it. And that came to me. This one, especially more"
298.12,303.47999999999996," than half life two or one. It's this episodic one that I really felt all week and like, wow,"
303.47999999999996,307.64," I'm just playing an adventure game here. I mean, you don't even get, have you guys played it yet?"
308.28,311.88," No. Just just just just just don't even get, I don't think it's a big spoiler, but you don't even"
311.88,317.79999999999995, get a real gun until the third chapter. It's just you and the gravity gun. And it's basically
317.88,323.0," just adventure game puzzles from one room to another. You go to the next part of the game,"
323.0,328.28000000000003," the next environment. And it's just, well, how do I get out of here now? How do I get over there?"
328.28000000000003,333.16, And it's usually some thing involving the gravity gun. It's all logic. I got to move this thing
333.16,339.8," over here to get to this over there. There's no, I haven't shot anything yet. And it did make me think,"
339.8,345.16," well, this is what's happened to the genre. Now I'm doing logic puzzles with physics."
345.96000000000004,351.24," Right. Because the old style adventure games, like I think physics is a much more intuitive way to do"
351.24,356.04, the puzzle than to like give you a bunch of random ideas of being inventory and hope you click on.
356.04,361.40000000000003," You know, the Pada-Honey and the comb at the same time. Right. Yeah. The ones in the first the longest"
361.40000000000003,368.44000000000005," journey were like, whoa. Yeah. That was a tough game. That was a hard game. Yeah."
368.44000000000005,373.08000000000004," But I, you know, those old adventure games, it wasn't even playing for those insane, you know,"
373.15999999999997,377.96, random puzzles. It was more for the more for the narratives. Yeah. I agree. When the
377.96,383.08," like game like long as journey, I think I pretty much played with the walk through and front of me."
383.08,387.0, Because I really just wanted to experience the story. I don't want to get hung up too much on the
387.0,393.24," puzzle part. You know, LucasArts games, though, all those wacky inventory puzzles. Like that was kind of"
393.24,398.84, the fun of it. Right. Like they weren't very logical in a real world setting. You hard sort of
398.84,406.59999999999997, had to get into that mind like great. I don't know if it's fun for some of them. There was a couple
406.59999999999997,409.79999999999995," and one of the, one of the Indian adjoins, what's the, remember, where was just you had to combine"
409.79999999999995,414.03999999999996, three totally random things and use it. It's something else. And I remember screaming at my monitor
414.03999999999996,417.4," after it was like, I can't believe that was it. Because I was just at the point where I was just"
417.4,421.4," clicking every possible, bringing it to everything on right screen. That was when the genre,"
421.4,425.71999999999997," that was before facts. You know, you could just delve on them off the net. Yeah. So to give"
425.72,430.44000000000005," you to do that, I remember always having my inventory open and just clicking everything on everything."
430.44000000000005,436.36," I'm sure. That's the first thing that you do. But it's true. Like other RPGs too, like fall out,"
436.36,442.44000000000005," had some adventuary kind of elements to it too. I felt like like there were little, you know,"
442.44000000000005,447.56," like fixing, you had to, I had to fix the water pump and then there was a secondary thing you"
447.56,450.84000000000003," have to do after you do. You know, and you have to sort of go through, you have to talk to this"
450.84,456.44," person and get this item and then figure out how to combine it with, there was a skill in it."
456.44,460.52, Wasn't it like a science skill or something? It was a science skill that would help you repair items
460.52,466.52," or put things together and stuff like that. So not only did FPSs bring some adventure elements,"
466.52,471.55999999999995," but also I think those sort of, that's a good call for RPGs. Actually, I think system shock"
471.55999999999995,478.28," too did that a little bit. Yeah, that was a great. Yeah, that was a great game. Yeah. But then the"
478.28,483.64," question remains like, I mean, you played Dreamfall and you liked it. I loved it. So maybe there"
483.64,489.64," still is a place for that traditional point and click sort of adventure. I loved it, but I also,"
489.64,495.96," you know, garnered, hated it. And although I think he's wrong, I do understand like when I read"
495.96,501.79999999999995," his review, I understand every point that he's making. They're real. They're true points."
501.79999999999995,506.91999999999996, I just think that there's so many other things going on in that game. Like you said the story
507.0,511.96000000000004, or the emotional attachment that I started feeling for the characters. I really just needed to know
511.96000000000004,515.8000000000001, what was going to happen to you. So is that what you loved about it? Not the puzzle solving
515.8000000000001,519.72," aspect or was it really good? Well, some of the puzzles are really good, especially I would say in the"
519.72,524.76," first half of the game, they were really good. And when you solved them, I felt like I'm smart and I"
524.76,531.24, figured this out. And that's the kind of reward you want. Sure. Yeah. The later puzzles did start getting
531.32,539.24, a little obtuse. And then there was the combat. Which is a really bad call. I don't know why they
539.24,545.0," decided to put in combat. That's to appeal to the youth. Well, it appeals, I don't know if it"
545.0,553.16," appealed to anyone. Did you have anything to come back? Yeah, you had to. You couldn't skip it. There"
553.16,558.12," were some, it was very bizarre. There were two or three scenes where you were just sort of dropped"
558.12,562.68, into combat. And you couldn't run off. You couldn't run away. You couldn't find another way around.
562.68,568.2, And what I loved about the first long as journey is that April couldn't die. Like you could make
568.2,572.92," it, you know, you could not solve the puzzle. Right. But she was never, yeah, she never. She's"
572.92,579.5600000000001, never. She's sharing about that. Right. And the whole idea is not to be in combat really. And
579.5600000000001,584.76, they sort of gave that up. And I died so many times in these stupid combat. But they have a
585.72,590.52," dying ability to die kind of curbs. You know, that was an old Lucas Rural. You could never"
590.52,595.56, die in a Lucas search game. That was across the companies to happen after Maniac Mansion because
595.56,599.64, I remember there was specific characters. I could die in Maniac Mansion. You could die. You could die
599.64,603.64," in, um, because you could have died in full throttle. You could die in the Indiana Jones game. But"
603.64,609.56," that's just like, yeah, Indiana Jones. Of course, you're going to be in danger. Right. Grim"
609.56,615.56," and Dango, you are already dead. I don't know. It can die anymore. Right. That's interesting."
615.56,620.3599999999999, The role of death in games. It doesn't make it more exciting when you can die.
620.3599999999999,625.4," Well, the old series games that you should be fun just to just figure out the ways you could"
625.4,631.0799999999999," die to see all the stupid death issues that they program them. Well, death is nothing like an"
631.0799999999999,636.4399999999999, action kind of game. Like serves the purpose of making you not being idiot constantly. Right.
636.44,640.36," And like an MMO, it serves a big purpose because it has the same kind of, you know,"
640.36,644.2800000000001," if this isn't challenging and if death doesn't mean anything, then you know, will"
644.2800000000001,649.0," just all be a bunch of idiots until we write a system. Or that was kind of the, you know,"
649.0,652.6, that's argument with the guys making Vanguard. Right. That's why they still have corpse runs in
652.6,656.0400000000001," their game. Right. Oh, everyone after ever quest pretty much, I know I got no one ever wants to"
656.0400000000001,660.44," do a corpse run. That's terrible. Right. They're saying, no, it should have a consequence. When"
660.44,664.44," when you die, that means you did some wrong and you should have to pay for it. Right."
664.7600000000001,668.6800000000001," I don't know if you feel like maybe that's a cheap way out. I mean, it's easy to make someone die."
668.6800000000001,674.6, It's harder to build a challenge around something else. Like what are other ways that games can
674.6,681.48, teach us success and failure without having to basically die is ending the game. Yeah. Right. Failure.
681.48,686.5200000000001, Right. And it breaks the pace of the game. Great question of bliving and that kind of have
686.5200000000001,692.6, multiple paths to make you kind of like feel bad instead of killing you. Like your humiliation.
692.6,697.5600000000001," Yeah. Like either or like just moral sickness, you're just like, oh, I can't believe that's the"
697.5600000000001,701.48, conclusion I can't do even though there's like a bunch of other possible conclusions. Right.
702.0400000000001,707.24," Yeah. Yeah. I'll blivvian had some of that to knit. Yeah. That's right. Like a, that's right. There was"
707.24,712.44," that one half, like paranoid guy who didn't skin granted something like that. That was, yeah, that guy."
712.44,717.48, Yeah. I'm going to make you do like follow people around for how yeah. Yeah. I love that guy. I did
717.48,722.6800000000001, that a few times. Did you kill him? I eventually did. You did. You killed him. But after I did
722.6800000000001,726.76," it, I'm like, that can't have been the right way to do it. And then I saw what's up with that guy. What was"
726.76,731.4," he, what did he want? He wants you to follow other villagers. Right. But what did it ever come out?"
731.4,735.24," Because I didn't finish that quest. Like what he was, why you were following them? Well, the"
735.24,739.08," way. He thought they did it. Yeah. He was really paranoid. Right. And like, that's some conspiracy"
739.08,743.8000000000001," theory against you. And then like when you do follow him around, there's no at least not I played it."
743.8,747.8," I, you know, like who knows if this is actually it. But if when I played it,"
747.8,751.4799999999999," I followed him around and they were like, hello, you know, I'm just going to work. And they never"
751.4799999999999,755.16," really. And then he like would bring him up. He was like, hey, do you know what? It's a crazy half off."
755.16,758.5999999999999," And he's like, oh, yeah, he's a little, it's a little office. And then they, you know, go about"
758.5999999999999,762.76," their business. But then just kept building and building. And you're like, you're still not sure if"
762.76,768.8399999999999," he might be right or if he's crazy. And then I did, you know, the way I finished it was, you know,"
768.84,774.9200000000001," I had the guards killing. Why do you do that for? He goes mad at one point. Well, at the end,"
774.9200000000001,781.08," like after you, well, I think when I did it, I said all three of these people he had me follow were"
782.52,785.72," there, there's nothing wrong with them. They're not following me. And he turned on me."
786.44,790.2," He said, you must be part of the conspiracy, too. So I said, but then I reloaded and I did this like"
790.2,795.4000000000001," five times and tried to hurt him. And I said, okay, the third guy, oh yeah, he did say, you know,"
795.48,800.1999999999999," he is following you. So, and then he gave me a note, a secret note that said, okay, now go in his"
800.1999999999999,805.24," house and kill him. So, wow. And then you can go kill these guys if you want,"
806.28,810.52, bring them to the guard. And I felt really bad about killing those guys because then like some sort of
810.52,815.9599999999999," dark vision started watching here, something else. But yeah, it's a, it's so many different ways to go."
815.9599999999999,824.28," And like, none of them felt right. That's why I feel like, you know, how oblivion got re-rated to be an"
824.36,830.8399999999999," evident game. But I feel like it kind of should have been emrated to begin with because, I mean,"
830.8399999999999,837.8," you know, it is kind of, it does deal with mature themes like, like insanity and madness. And it does"
837.8,843.64," ask you to do a lot of things that one consider sort of, um, like there's maybe there's no blood,"
843.64,848.52," but does that make it any less, a key to like kill innocent people in their sleep, which one"
848.52,853.48," quest wanted me to do? That's really good. I don't know if I saw that wasn't the vampire quest,"
854.44,858.04," no, it wasn't the vampire quest because those are vampire. No, it was one of the dark brother"
858.04,861.64," had quest. In fact, all the dark brother had to be all kind of like that. Yeah."
862.44,866.04, To get you guys to do the quest where you had to get the thing that like was it a ring or something
866.04,871.5600000000001, that's at the bottom of that well? Yeah. And that that. How well was it? Do you like have to strip
871.5600000000001,875.0, naked to pick that thing up? That's what I did. That's what I did. That's what I did. That's what I
875.0,880.44," liked about stuff outside and then some, yeah. Oh, it was. No, it was a parade of that. Yeah, because it was"
880.44,884.12," gone when I came out. I don't know if it just like game mechanic, but we were like,"
884.12,888.2," just someone actually stole it. I always wondered about that because until I got my house, I would"
888.2,893.0, have all this stuff with me and I would just sort of deposit it in areas around the world and come
893.0,898.2800000000001, back to it later. And I always wondered if it makes sense that other people would take it. Right.
898.2800000000001,901.8800000000001, And I started leaving things only in like the mages guild. Yeah.
901.8800000000001,905.72, Yeah. I still the mages guild blind. I still.
906.6800000000001,911.4, I've rolled up one without repercussions. No. I should join. That's what I'm going to have to
911.4,918.12, start a year and rate it thing right there. You know? Yeah. The definition of M is a little too
918.12,923.24," based on bullet points. Yeah, a little bit. Well, it's usually all, you know, what it's that"
923.24,928.9200000000001," are like, sir, violent. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just looking at the requirements for here is a"
928.9200000000001,934.76," might magic five, which I'm reviewing. I saw it was rated teen and I was like, I did, I didn't"
934.84,940.36," understand why because it's just, you know, completely harmless fantasy strategy game. It's like chest."
941.08,945.8," So I looked at the, you know, the SRB thing has a breakdown of what's in it. You know, it's like blood."
947.16,953.4, Something and suggestive themes. I played this game from start to end. What is suggestive in this game?
954.6,961.4," Warms, um, fairies and, you know, titans. I can't figure it out. I'm thinking now it's cleavage."
961.88,967.0," Is it? Yeah. Oh, it's a bit like, like, your SRB was like, hmm, that's right."
967.0,971.9599999999999," So, the little skip height elf cleavage equals suggestive theme. Yeah. Yeah. That's hot."
974.04,978.6," Well, I did, speaking of suggestive themes and I did attend that conference last week,"
978.6,985.56," which was all about basically, I guess, a O games. It was about games that featured"
985.96,991.16, sexuality as a pretty big component of the game itself. And that was kind of interesting.
991.4,996.04, You're going to make us all nervous here in a podcast. I'm sorry. We have a woman on our part.
996.04,1000.92," That's all about sex. Well, that was the other interesting thing. At this conference,"
1000.92,1008.04," it was very, there were more women there in proportion that I've seen in GBC. Wow. Yeah. That's interesting."
1008.04,1014.28," And the, the average age was up there. It was like, what do you think that means? Well, I have to"
1014.28,1019.3199999999999," question about it on my blog. And I said, I'm not exactly sure. I think, I think, I think for one thing,"
1019.4000000000001,1025.8," women are maybe more interested in talking about the repercussions of sex because of, like,"
1027.16,1033.3200000000002," we just want to do it and have a sandwich. Well, because, because women have more consequences"
1033.3200000000002,1038.1200000000001," from it, you know, like, you could say pregnancy or emotional attachment or whatever. Like,"
1038.1200000000001,1043.96," to women, I think, tend to want to talk about it more in terms of how it affects their lives."
1044.92,1051.0," And secondly, I think it's, you know, men might want to talk about it, but it seems maybe"
1051.0,1058.8400000000001," sleazy if a guy starts just, you know, talking about sex in, in mixed company, where is a"
1058.8400000000001,1063.96," for woman, broaches a subject. It's maybe easier in some ways. So do you think it's sleazy that"
1063.96,1069.16," we're talking about it with you now? No, because I brought it up. Okay. Okay. See, but that's the thing."
1069.16,1075.0800000000002," It's like, you sort of wait for a, a slight person to bring it up. Maybe. I don't know exactly,"
1075.0800000000002,1079.48," but there were a lot of women there. Well, I think a lot of people are just so afraid of who they"
1079.48,1087.0800000000002," might offend. Yeah. You know, it's like, we'll have some of the ludous conversations over in the"
1087.0800000000002,1094.3600000000001," DLTV area. And now we have a new news reporter, her name's Natalie. And it's like, I knew she was"
1094.36,1101.0, gone. And I saw that somebody posted the internet as foreporn world of warcraft video. Yeah.
1101.0,1106.52," And I turned it up a little bit Patrick freaked out. You know, he's like, but her, it's like she's"
1106.52,1111.24," gone. Oh, okay. Never mind. You know, it's, it's we're so afraid of who we're going to offend with"
1111.24,1116.9199999999998," with the subject of sex because when guys talk about it, well, especially when they're acting like"
1116.9199999999998,1122.9199999999998," 13-year-old. Well, there's that, too. This is our entire industry. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean,"
1122.92,1127.24," it's, that's right. I think it's a big part of it. It's who we're going to offend. And what are"
1127.24,1132.3600000000001," they going to do about it? And especially in the work environment, that's a whole host of problems."
1132.3600000000001,1137.96," Sure. So. Yeah. So it was, I mean, it was a little weird to be at this conference where everyone's talking"
1137.96,1142.44," very seriously, very academically about how to sexually, you know, what people are sexually"
1142.44,1146.28, excited by and what kind of fetishes there are on the internet and all this stuff. And then at the
1146.28,1152.52," same time, you have running in the background, this game called Virtual Hottie 2. It's like this."
1153.64,1160.8400000000001," That's it. Hey. Oh. Okay. Where I don't know. It was just very, I felt extremely awkward like"
1160.8400000000001,1166.6000000000001," at junior high sex ad class where it's like, you know, we have all these clinical terms and"
1166.6000000000001,1171.72," you're just sort of on the verge of ciggling the whole time because it's like, I don't know."
1171.72,1176.44," It was just, there was a little bit of an odd, odd vibe. But it was very interesting. There are"
1176.92,1184.1200000000001," a huge number of people, I guess, who are interested in adult oriented content on every platform"
1184.1200000000001,1192.3600000000001," including mobile, which seems kind of like, and I saw like a sample mobile game and it was kind of like"
1192.3600000000001,1200.52," naked Sims. And I was like, okay, but when she was small, when she rather just watched porn or something,"
1200.52,1205.8, then that's what I don't get. Yeah. There's a thing to see question about why wouldn't you just do porn instead
1205.8,1211.8799999999999," of doing these weird sex games? Right. So yeah, we used to have these games around CGW that were like"
1211.8799999999999,1219.1599999999999," these strip bowling games. You know, you keep bowling well, then the FMV girl takes off another item"
1219.1599999999999,1224.36," of clothing and it's like, my father's got to be the element of control. I mean, I think that's"
1224.36,1228.44," the explanation could obviously, like it's, especially with the older games you're talking about,"
1228.44,1235.1599999999999, there's not the quality isn't nearly as high. Right. So it's got to be about some level of control
1235.16,1240.44, in that case if you were to. Yeah. And it is like some of the panelists were talking about how
1240.44,1247.24, there's a guy there who is a sexologist. I guess he's a sex therapist. Yeah. And he would same
1247.24,1253.24," what we all for the most part a lot of people have it in their heads, right? Like it's in their head."
1253.24,1258.8400000000001, So it's about whether or not you respond to just pure images or whether you need to have
1258.8400000000001,1263.64," like some people don't respond unless they think there's an actual other person, a real person."
1263.8000000000002,1269.0800000000002," Like for example, in phone sex or in cyber sex, I hate saying that word."
1269.64,1275.0, The online chat on the online chat stuff. Like they want to know that at least that there's
1275.0,1279.4," someone else there to get out. Or, you know, there's all kinds of different things I guess. But some"
1279.4,1286.76," of those sex games just frankly do not look very sexy to me. Right. Like Reanna Rouge, remember that one."
1287.08,1292.2, I guess you have a 3D game rate. Oh yeah. I think we'll do that through day. Yeah.
1292.2,1297.16," And then like, yeah. That doesn't accept this kind of embarrassing you. I just I probably have"
1297.16,1302.6," that just look at porn reaction every time I see one of those. I mean, if the goal of the game is"
1302.6,1310.36, to see whatever nakedness like it's out there. You don't have to. I've heard. You don't have to virtually
1310.36,1314.9199999999998, bull. Yeah. Good to see. I make it in the Google on the left. Any of the time.
1314.9199999999998,1319.0," I swear like, you know, 1, 7, 10, split and I just be, you know, forget it. Never mind."
1319.7199999999998,1325.32, I'm going to Google naked girls screw this bowling. There's a whole other element of like how
1325.32,1329.6399999999999," people can be even attracted to like, you know, the night elf character on the screen. That's an"
1329.6399999999999,1335.56, abstraction. Yeah. Look at all the people that play second life. You were there when they were
1335.6399999999999,1341.48," you know about stuff, right? Right. Like, yeah. Which would that. Yeah. Well, with second life,"
1341.48,1346.52," because it's an MMO, I think the a lot of the excitement comes from knowing that other people are"
1346.52,1352.52," participating and reacting. And like some of the people on panels and stuff said, there were a"
1352.52,1359.96," bunch of developers who developed erotic MMOs, which I learned was called MMOEG, by the way. Really."
1360.04,1368.6000000000001," Yeah. MMOEG play on line erotic games. Oh, okay. Way to go, Jeff. I was never going to pull out the"
1368.6000000000001,1373.64," bedding. If you're going to change, they need it. They need their initiation. Yeah, I guess so."
1373.64,1380.8400000000001," They're like five coming out this year, later this year, I guess. Five. And they're saying that a lot of"
1380.8400000000001,1388.76," people also like to seem to like to explore alternative lifestyles, whether it's playing as a"
1388.76,1394.6," different gender, which you know, as we all know, it's very popular in standard MMOs. So you can"
1394.6,1400.76," hear you can take it maybe a step further or exploring like, you know, homosexuality or bisexuality"
1400.76,1407.48," or freeality. We've discussed that a lot of CG. Oh, God. It's not the first time this is"
1407.48,1411.4, going to happen. Yeah. The final amount of free is keep coming up in our podcast. They don't
1411.4,1416.04," seem to like us very much either, who the furries. Yeah. We got some pretty strongly worded"
1416.04,1421.6399999999999," to be held last time we brought the furries. Yeah. Yeah. Not a that is an organized group, not"
1421.6399999999999,1429.32, like the official body of furries sent us a form letter. Which would be funny as well. Right.
1430.52,1436.04," So I'm getting a signal that we have to break. All right. Scott, we have to write this. Okay,"
1436.04,1440.84, we're going to break for our our lovely sponsor and we'll be right back. Support for us.

1499.96,1503.96, do you guys remember the names of those guys who were playing And One basketball? Do you remember?
1504.76,1507.24," No, weeksaw, sweat of their names."
1507.24,1508.76," Oh, hot sauce."
1508.76,1510.36, Weeks.
1510.36,1511.72," Oh, we've got a lot of stuff."
1511.72,1515.24," Oh, you're going to get a strongly word of letter for his football."
1515.32,1518.84, I'm sorry. And Run basketball. Hot sauce. Not weeks.
1520.1200000000001,1523.48, I just remember I was looking at that over the week and thinking like do people have friends
1523.48,1523.88, name that?
1525.88,1526.04, Do you know what?
1526.04,1527.24, The name hot sauce at my side?
1527.24,1534.52," If you've watched any of the streetball on ESPN, they have some that I unfortunately don't remember"
1534.52,1536.68," any of them, but some of their names are just insane."
1538.04,1539.48, This is their nickname.
1539.48,1541.08," Yeah, that's almost the game or tag."
1541.08,1542.04," Yeah, exactly."
1542.04,1543.72," Yeah, I think it is like a game of tag."
1544.1200000000001,1544.84, We were a name.
1545.64,1546.68, I got a camera all crazy.
1547.72,1548.52, So what about?
1548.52,1549.48, Hot sauce?
1549.48,1549.96, That's it.
1549.96,1550.3600000000001, Nothing.
1550.3600000000001,1551.08, That was a guy.
1554.3600000000001,1555.32, You know I brought that.
1555.32,1557.08, I'm sure you talked about the next issue.
1557.08,1558.04, Did you want to talk about?
1558.04,1560.1200000000001," Well, are we done with sex?"
1560.76,1561.48, Are we ever?
1561.48,1562.68," No, never."
1562.68,1567.0," But I mean, did you think that this was a was a worth it?"
1567.0,1568.52," I mean, did you get stuff out of that?"
1568.52,1570.6000000000001," Yeah, yeah, I did."
1570.6000000000001,1573.16, And I also think that developers who were there did.
1574.2,1577.64, Which I think it was mainly for them is to start thinking about these issues.
1577.64,1580.52, I think they were able to meet other people who were doing the same thing.
1580.52,1583.88, And it's kind of something that's sort of on the download maybe.
1583.88,1587.48, So maybe it's not something that you would know a whole lot about if you were doing it.
1587.48,1592.44," And I think they got some really useful information, especially from a Sherry Greiner Ray,"
1592.44,1596.3600000000001," who's the author of Gender Inclusive Game Design,"
1596.3600000000001,1597.4, was her last book.
1597.4,1601.0, She's working on a new book now that's not about gender.
1601.0,1602.2, It's just about game design.
1602.2,1605.8, But she had a lot of interesting things to say about how to bring
1607.0,1611.24," female players to an MMO, EG, or to a Rod at Games."
1611.24,1617.4," She said, you know, flipping what a lot of male developers think is you have like,"
1617.4,1618.68," you know, virtual hotty."
1618.68,1621.56," And they think if they just make the model into a man,"
1621.56,1623.0800000000002," then boom, you can sell it to women."
1623.0800000000002,1626.2," And she's like, no, no, no, no, doesn't work like that."
1626.2,1627.16, It's something else.
1627.16,1628.68, And so she gave a talk about that.
1628.68,1630.68, And that was really interesting.
1631.64,1636.1200000000001," You know, my big fear in an MMO, EG, where I supply it,"
1636.1200000000001,1637.88, why would many big fears?
1637.88,1644.04," But one of them would be that, you know, if I wanted to go on to do whatever I would do on there,"
1644.04,1649.3200000000002," that the quote unquote, women I would be talking to would actually just be other 40 year old guys,"
1649.3200000000002,1649.88, right?
1649.88,1650.3600000000001, Right.
1650.3600000000001,1650.52, Right.
1650.52,1651.5600000000002, Like it isn't wild.
1651.5600000000002,1652.6000000000001, And they addressed that.
1652.6000000000001,1659.64," And some people were saying, it doesn't matter to some people because they are just in the realm of fantasy."
1659.72,1661.72, And they don't think too much about it.
1661.72,1663.88," But for other people, it is a big concern."
1663.88,1668.92," And then so maybe there are areas where you can go to where it's voice chat in a house,"
1668.92,1672.1200000000001," something, you know, things like that so that you can try to cater to a lot of people."
1672.1200000000001,1673.3200000000002, That's a really good falsetto.
1673.3200000000002,1674.44, Would screw that up too.
1677.48,1677.8000000000002, Yeah.
1677.8000000000002,1678.2800000000002, That's good.
1678.2800000000002,1679.24, That's my brush.
1680.2800000000002,1681.4, That's not Jane talking.
1681.4,1681.8000000000002," Oh, wow."
1684.44,1688.2800000000002," And of course, we, I'm saying this is someone who was traumatized by Robert"
1688.36,1690.84, Coffee's Star Wars Calcy's Person.
1692.36,1693.56, What are you talking about?
1693.56,1694.76," Oh, that's Nick's coming."
1696.04,1698.12, Robert is a strange strange.
1698.12,1698.52, Yeah.
1698.52,1699.8," Well, he wrote about it."
1699.8,1701.96, He wrote about it in his column for CGW.
1701.96,1708.04, But he spent a great many hours way too many hours as a lap dancer in Star Wars got.
1708.04,1710.2," Oh, I thought that was Sims."
1710.2,1710.84, I was Star Wars.
1710.84,1711.8799999999999, That he's Star Wars Galaxies.
1711.8799999999999,1715.32," And then he was a, he was a, you could be a dancer."
1715.32,1716.28," Oh, right."
1716.28,1716.6, Yeah.
1716.6,1718.4399999999998, And he just took that to the next lap.
1718.4399999999998,1720.4399999999998, If they say the gaming business.
1720.4399999999998,1723.56," I, I was walking by the cube one day and all of a sudden,"
1723.56,1726.04," I hear him scream go, I'm a whore."
1726.04,1727.0, I just stopped.
1727.0,1727.32, Yeah.
1727.32,1729.1599999999999," Well, he did that before he ever placed ours."
1729.1599999999999,1729.8799999999999, Got to be well.
1731.1599999999999,1732.04, We know that.
1732.04,1735.08," But, you know, I kind of stopped look over the, the side of the cube."
1735.08,1736.9199999999998," He was like, oh, so I just paid me for dancing for him."
1736.9199999999998,1738.1999999999998," I'm like, okay."
1738.1999999999998,1739.8, That was probably the beginning of his career.
1739.8,1741.1599999999999, Because then he really got into it.
1741.1599999999999,1742.84, He had like regular clients.
1742.84,1743.8799999999999," I mean, he would talk about it."
1743.88,1746.7600000000002," We'd like be out, you know, in public at launch."
1746.7600000000002,1749.8000000000002," And he'd say, oh, you know, one of my clients gave me a new necklace today."
1749.8000000000002,1750.6000000000001," We're like, Robert."
1752.3600000000001,1752.8400000000001, Come on.
1753.48,1754.8400000000001, That's a great.
1754.8400000000001,1758.1200000000001," I mean, I think it's fantastic because really, you know,"
1758.1200000000001,1759.72, you can explore lots of different things.
1759.72,1762.6000000000001," And the repercussions, which, you know, there are some,"
1762.6000000000001,1765.0, because some people do get emotionally involved.
1765.0,1768.5200000000002, And that's where like it can be dangerous if there's two people talking.
1768.5200000000002,1771.5600000000002, And one thinks it's just whatever in the realm of fantasy.
1771.5600000000002,1772.7600000000002, And I'm really not who I say.
1773.08,1775.72," And the other person says, you know, hey, let's meet."
1775.72,1776.76, I fall in love.
1776.76,1778.44," And then it's like, whoa, what do you do?"
1778.44,1779.0, Yeah.
1779.0,1779.8, That's fun.
1779.8,1780.36, Yeah.
1780.36,1781.16, I've heard it.
1781.16,1782.2, I need to stress about that.
1782.2,1782.84, Yeah.
1782.84,1783.8, A little scary.
1783.8,1784.84, Mm-hmm.
1784.84,1785.48, Yeah.
1785.48,1785.64, Yeah.
1785.64,1791.4," I knew two guys who were playing one character in, uh,"
1791.4,1793.0, and they were game developers too.
1793.0,1794.28, So that's why I'm not going to say their name.
1794.28,1795.8799999999999, But they were playing their own MMO.
1796.76,1800.6, And they were playing as a female character.
1800.6799999999998,1805.0, And they got a male character to basically fall in love with them.
1805.0,1807.08, And they were going to get married in the game.
1807.6399999999999,1812.12," And, uh, and the guy, this game, or on the other side, was, you know, really into it."
1812.12,1813.8799999999999," I mean, it was their characters getting married."
1813.8799999999999,1816.6799999999998," But he was saying a lot of stuff in chat that was like, you know,"
1817.48,1819.24," I'm really into you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1819.24,1822.4399999999998," And at the 11th hour, they finally said, okay, hey, look,"
1822.4399999999998,1825.32," you know that we're just, this is just for fun."
1825.32,1828.12," And actually this is where two guys here and blah, blah, blah."
1828.12,1829.9599999999998, And they never heard from that guy.
1830.8400000000001,1832.68," Yeah, that's hard."
1832.68,1833.96, And somewhere he's broken harded.
1834.6000000000001,1839.56," But there were some stories recently about, um,"
1839.56,1843.88," wasn't it in, um, what magazine was it that I was reading about these two,"
1844.76,1847.0, people who fell in love.
1847.0,1850.2," And anyway, there's been some mainstream press attention"
1850.2,1853.72, paid to places like wow and stuff are actual religious characters.
1853.72,1854.3600000000001, They're cool about them.
1854.3600000000001,1855.0, They're July issues.
1855.0,1856.28, Maybe it was CGW.
1856.28,1857.48," Yeah, that's right."
1857.48,1858.8400000000001, There was one in CGW.
1859.0,1860.84," Yeah, we should talk about the issue."
1860.84,1861.3999999999999, There was one.
1861.3999999999999,1865.8," I feel like it's someone in the newspaper also recently about, wow."
1865.8,1869.48, And I know why it has always been to interested in doing stories.
1869.48,1872.52," You know, I was going to, I was going to say when you're talking about the sex"
1872.52,1874.9199999999998, and gaming conference in the last couple issues.
1874.9199999999998,1877.9599999999998, We run a couple articles on sex and gaming.
1877.9599999999998,1880.9199999999998, And we have gotten so much hate mail over.
1880.9199999999998,1881.56, Really?
1881.56,1881.9599999999998, Yeah.
1881.9599999999998,1882.9199999999998," What, why?"
1882.9199999999998,1885.48," Just for talking about it and just for talking about it,"
1885.56,1888.04," I don't want to read about, you know, sleazy,"
1888.04,1891.4, porno stuff and more or the moms or dads getting mad or something.
1891.4,1892.1200000000001, A little bit of that.
1892.1200000000001,1892.44, Yeah.
1892.44,1893.24, Yeah.
1893.24,1893.64, Yeah.
1893.64,1896.84," I buy my, this magazine, so my song can see severed heads."
1896.84,1897.64, Right.
1897.64,1898.68, Not looking press.
1898.68,1903.24," I like to think there's a on vocal majority who are reading it and going, yeah,"
1903.24,1904.6," the good article, good article,"
1904.6,1906.76, rather than the vocal minority who are always complaining.
1906.76,1911.32," Because if you live in the email complaints, then it's a well-"
1911.32,1912.52, I said life.
1912.6,1916.28," But we really, we're trying to write articles that we're actually talking about."
1916.28,1919.16," These things, and we're just like, oh, there are sex and games."
1919.16,1919.48, Right.
1919.48,1921.16, Then you still want to get the letters.
1921.16,1927.48," Well, unfortunately, I think there's the attitude that gamers and people who write about games"
1927.48,1928.84, are exactly that.
1928.84,1934.84," You know, they're the dopey, you know, wanting to be the teenager of the rest of their life."
1934.84,1938.76, And that's kind of like the attitude and where some of these people are coming from.
1938.76,1941.8," It's like, well, you're just talking about it to talk about tits."
1941.8,1943.8," They own, yeah."
1943.8,1944.28, I don't know.
1944.28,1946.04," I didn't spending out my ass, so."
1947.8,1950.2, We've been using a lot of profanity in this podcast.
1950.2,1951.08, That's not really.
1951.08,1952.04," No, we were okay."
1952.04,1952.68, No.
1952.68,1954.36, We don't have the explicit tag yet.
1954.36,1955.16," No, what?"
1955.16,1956.84," Well, tits is not allowed."
1957.72,1958.36, It's all in now.
1958.36,1959.56," You thought it was one of the, sorry."
1959.56,1962.04," Is that one of the, it's one of the FCC's rules of seven."
1962.04,1962.52, It is.
1962.52,1964.76," It's just a make any sense to me, but it is."
1964.76,1967.72," You can't say tits, but you can say no, it's a toughy cat."
1968.04,1969.32, You can say tits.
1970.52,1971.8, Even if you say it one more time.
1971.8,1975.32," It's just, it's just, yeah."
1976.1200000000001,1977.8, You want to get to the list.
1977.8,1979.56, I've taken this with a one week.
1979.56,1981.0, My daughter's not going to be able to listen.
1981.0,1982.76," Oh, the one way."
1983.64,1984.44," Yeah, okay."
1984.44,1986.3600000000001," Yeah, what else do we have on our last year?"
1986.3600000000001,1987.32, That we could talk.
1987.32,1988.52, Let's get away from this.
1988.52,1989.32, What?
1989.32,1992.1200000000001, We could talk about the issue that's coming out.
1992.1200000000001,1992.92, Positively.
1992.92,1994.76," So, what are the highlights of the next issue, kids?"
1994.76,1995.56, Yeah.
1995.56,1996.76, Let's go into that.
1996.92,1998.36, Do we want to talk about that?
1998.36,1999.8, That's like a spoiler.
1999.8,2000.52, Is that?
2000.52,2001.56, The one we're working on now.
2001.56,2002.52," Come on, we're working on now."
2002.52,2004.68," So, I'm with a splinter saw on the cover."
2004.68,2005.8799999999999, That one week of talk about it.
2005.8799999999999,2006.68," Yeah, right."
2006.68,2007.8799999999999, That's one I was talking about.
2007.8799999999999,2008.68, That's the one you meant.
2008.68,2009.16, Yeah.
2009.16,2011.8799999999999," I think it's just, what's the day today, the 12th?"
2011.8799999999999,2014.84," Yeah, that's a good issue."
2014.84,2017.0," Yeah, because I, I repurn it."
2017.0,2018.84," You, oh, is that the drink of the shit?"
2018.84,2019.8, Yeah.
2019.8,2023.24," If you're a fan of Jane by the new CGW,"
2023.24,2024.6, because she has a review of it.
2025.56,2027.8799999999999," And there's, you know, it's mine's not the only good review."
2027.8799999999999,2029.6399999999999, And then I've seen some others in there.
2029.6399999999999,2030.6799999999998, That was so pretty good.
2030.6799999999998,2032.12," Yeah, there's a few others."
2032.12,2033.32," Not as good as yours, Jane."
2035.32,2036.12, The kids are asking.
2036.12,2037.6399999999999, You just want me to write more.
2037.6399999999999,2038.6," Exactly, I do."
2038.6,2040.6," Yeah, we need, we need more good writers."
2040.6,2041.7199999999998, Didn't she do a good job?
2041.7199999999998,2043.24, She did a very good job.
2043.24,2043.8, Thank you guys.
2043.8,2044.4399999999998, That's a good.
2044.4399999999998,2045.6399999999999," Right, I was a good editor."
2046.4399999999998,2049.7999999999997," For me, let's see, how was that splinter saw cover story?"
2049.7999999999997,2050.92, I only flipped through it.
2050.92,2051.64, I didn't.
2051.64,2052.8399999999997, That was another good story.
2053.48,2054.2799999999997," Yeah, we sent,"
2055.2400000000002,2057.2400000000002," Robert Ashley over to,"
2058.44,2059.7200000000003," I was saying, we have on my details."
2059.7200000000003,2060.6000000000004," So they're saying,"
2060.6000000000004,2061.48, story of Shanghai.
2062.52,2063.88," Yeah, yeah, that's really good."
2063.88,2064.92," Yeah, that was cool."
2064.92,2066.0400000000004, That was good that he did that.
2066.0400000000004,2066.84, Yeah.
2066.84,2067.0800000000004, Yeah.
2067.0800000000004,2067.88, I turned it well.
2067.88,2069.0800000000004, That was a nice journal.
2069.0800000000004,2070.36," It was like, park to go to Shanghai."
2070.36,2071.0800000000004, I think.
2071.0800000000004,2074.6800000000003," The other features, the dirt farming versus non-dirt farming."
2074.6800000000003,2075.88," All right, we did a big,"
2075.88,2079.96," a big feature on RTS games, the new round."
2079.96,2082.52," And we asked all the developers,"
2083.0,2087.08, whether they had a resource gathering or not in their games
2087.08,2088.36, and explain why.
2089.16,2091.48, And I think we got some pretty good answers ahead of that.
2092.36,2093.16, Think so too.
2093.16,2093.56, Yeah.
2094.6,2095.72, Anything else in that issue?
2096.36,2097.16," Boy, sex lessons."
2097.16,2098.12, I'll also do it now.
2099.88,2101.64," Yeah, let's see."
2101.64,2103.16," Yeah, now it was a long time ago."
2103.64,2104.68, It was for you guys.
2104.68,2106.36, I feel like it just looked at it.
2106.36,2109.56," What was the Bruce versus, was there a talk versus Bruce?"
2109.56,2110.28, Every month.
2110.36,2111.32, This one's fail.
2111.32,2111.88, Fail wasn't it?
2112.6800000000003,2114.1200000000003, I was the pros.
2114.1200000000003,2116.6800000000003," Yeah, that one's that was good."
2117.32,2118.84, They're funny fellows.
2120.0400000000004,2122.6800000000003," You know, we could tell one thing about each Tom and Bruce."
2122.6800000000003,2124.6800000000003, We're tied up at this this morning.
2124.6800000000003,2127.0," If you read this column every month and don't know,"
2127.4,2132.36, those two guys actually have real lives outside of their three pages in CGW.
2132.36,2133.96," Yeah, very interesting."
2133.96,2134.6800000000003, Yes.
2134.6800000000003,2137.0, And Tom check is actually an actor.
2137.8,2139.88," Well, he's not full-time actor."
2139.96,2142.52, But he does a lot of like real actual acting.
2142.52,2146.36, He was in the West Wing for a number of episodes.
2147.2400000000002,2148.76," He was in the office, right?"
2148.76,2151.2400000000002, He had a bit role on one episode.
2151.2400000000002,2151.6400000000003, Yeah.
2151.6400000000003,2155.8," Yeah, if you're out to, I don't know, with the demographic of CGW podcast listeners"
2155.8,2157.0, to West Wing fans.
2157.96,2159.0, I bet there's a lot.
2159.0,2165.7200000000003, But if you watch the West Wing and you saw the kind of nervous reporter
2165.7200000000003,2168.52," guy with glasses, that was Tom check."
2169.0,2169.8, And which season?
2171.0,2173.16," Two seasons ago, I think."
2173.16,2173.64, Okay.
2173.64,2176.28, Maybe even watch the West Wing.
2176.28,2177.08, Yeah.
2177.08,2178.28," Well, it's now gone away."
2178.28,2179.4, He's probably because of him.
2179.4,2180.7599999999998," Yeah, probably."
2180.7599999999998,2181.4, Yeah.
2181.4,2182.7599999999998, And then Bruce Jerek.
2182.7599999999998,2183.56, Believe it or not.
2183.56,2185.24, Brain surgeon brain surgeon.
2185.24,2186.36," Oh, yeah."
2186.36,2186.92, Really?
2186.92,2187.4, Yeah.
2187.4,2188.36, That's impressive.
2188.36,2189.16, It was an echo.
2189.56,2189.96, Yeah.
2189.96,2190.36, Yeah.
2190.36,2190.7599999999998, It's weird.
2190.7599999999998,2196.52, We actually have a lot of strangely overqualified people writing for CGW.
2196.52,2197.0, Yeah.
2197.0,2197.8, We have two lawyers.
2198.1200000000003,2206.1200000000003," We have an actor, a doctor, a CIA involved person."
2206.1200000000003,2206.92, Opportunity.
2206.92,2207.92, Really?
2207.92,2208.92, I guess you can't tell us who that would be.
2208.92,2211.48," No, we can't tell you we'd have to kill you."
2211.48,2214.84," And uh, just one of the CIA came to our office."
2215.7200000000003,2216.92, That's a question to hi.
2216.92,2218.04, I probably can't even say that.
2218.04,2219.1600000000003, I'm a dead man now.
2219.1600000000003,2220.84, I'm just kidding.
2220.84,2222.6000000000004, The CIA didn't come to the office.
2222.6000000000004,2225.1600000000003, I think it's not like you don't name names.
2225.1600000000003,2225.6400000000003, You're okay.
2225.6400000000003,2226.76, I think.
2227.7200000000003,2228.44, Don't call me on that.
2228.44,2229.6400000000003," You know, I love you, Mom."
2230.84,2235.5600000000004," I always wanted to have somebody like from the CIA or some other, or get a serious"
2235.5600000000004,2236.36, special course.
2236.36,2239.0800000000004," So, it was scary."
2239.0800000000004,2241.0," No, but I mean, I probably didn't use it that way."
2241.0,2241.32," Yeah, I'm checking."
2242.28,2245.88, Play games like Splinter Cell or like Metal Gear.
2245.88,2247.0800000000004," Yeah, it's like that."
2247.0800000000004,2248.1200000000003, That's what the idea is.
2248.1200000000003,2252.6000000000004," That uh, you know, and then just tell us, okay, is this at all?"
2252.6000000000004,2253.1600000000003, Yeah.
2253.1600000000003,2253.8, Yeah.
2253.8,2254.92, That was really worth it.
2254.92,2256.44," Yeah, I don't even think they're playing them in"
2256.92,2260.76, Do you know how to kill people with a flick of your wrist like Sam Fisher does?
2260.76,2261.32, Right.
2261.32,2261.8, Yeah.
2261.8,2263.48," Yeah, this guy, you talked him to it in the"
2263.48,2264.52, He was right.
2264.52,2265.0, Yeah.
2265.0,2269.96," This guy came in a, you know, he's wearing the dark suit and, you know,"
2269.96,2272.84, I kind of did like the thick neck and the crew cut.
2272.84,2277.08," And, but he, you know, he had to seem like a desktop though that could have just been a cover."
2277.08,2277.88," Yeah, I'm sure one."
2277.88,2278.52, I'm sure one.
2278.52,2279.88," Oh, yeah, hired killers."
2279.88,2283.48," But he just looked like, you know, did he intimidate you?"
2284.44,2287.56," Well, I mean, he didn't, he was kind of like humorless."
2287.56,2288.04, Yeah.
2288.04,2288.68, Really?
2288.68,2289.2400000000002, It was funny.
2289.2400000000002,2290.52, He was a stereotype.
2290.52,2291.72," Yeah, you couldn't make, oh yeah."
2291.72,2292.52, Yeah.
2292.52,2297.4," When I talked to him on the phone, um, see, you know, he, we were like,"
2297.4,2299.56," uh, references for this writer,"
2299.56,2300.68," uh, getting this job."
2300.68,2301.16, Right.
2301.16,2303.4," And he, uh, and um,"
2303.4,2307.08," We got, when I talked about the phone, he was like, you know,"
2307.08,2310.44," I'm, I'm gonna be there, you know, three o'clock or whatever."
2310.44,2312.6, What he didn't even ask the address or anything.
2312.6,2313.64, He didn't need it.
2313.64,2314.6, He didn't need it.
2314.6,2315.7999999999997, Yeah.
2315.7999999999997,2317.88, He'd already kid us helicoptered in.
2317.88,2320.6," And he, when I talked to him, he asked if there's anybody else."
2320.6,2321.4, I got talked to him.
2321.4,2323.4," Oh, you know, there's Jeff Green and Dan Glad."
2323.4,2323.56, Thanks.
2323.56,2326.04," So it was like, yeah, Green and Gladstone."
2326.04,2327.08, Like he just kept his friend.
2327.08,2329.64," Man, he took out my files."
2330.68,2332.12," Yeah, I didn't dare make any jokes."
2332.12,2335.88," So he was asking me, you know, drug use, you know, kind of things."
2335.88,2338.68," I mean, you know, every time I did LSD,"
2338.68,2340.44, he never wanted to do with me.
2340.52,2344.2000000000003," Yeah, when anything I did, I didn't want to go on my file."
2344.2000000000003,2346.52," No, I don't know anything, sir."
2346.52,2347.56, That was weird though.
2348.76,2350.04," Wow, that's funny."
2350.04,2351.16, I'm a hadry get on that.
2351.8,2352.2000000000003, I don't know.
2352.2000000000003,2353.32, He got you awesome.
2353.32,2354.84, People with awesome real jobs.
2354.84,2355.48," Oh, right."
2355.48,2356.52," Yeah, so he's direct."
2356.52,2358.12," Yeah, Chris Jack brain surgeon."
2358.12,2360.12," So every time, you know, everyone's in a wild hoop,"
2360.12,2361.96," like be late on an article and it's like,"
2361.96,2364.76," how do you, you can't, you know, because he got something, you know,"
2364.76,2366.44, because he got involved in something and work.
2367.16,2367.96, We'll be seeing some of you.
2367.96,2368.44, He can't really.
2368.44,2369.16, He can't.
2369.16,2369.4, Yeah.
2369.88,2371.96," Okay, if you were like inside somebody's brain,"
2373.0,2374.84, I guess he could be late on your rifle.
2374.84,2375.88, I thought you were late for a video.
2375.88,2377.7200000000003," Yeah, I would say yes."
2378.44,2379.8, There was a moment at E3.
2381.2400000000002,2386.36, I was hanging out one night there with Bruce Jarrick and with Eric
2386.36,2388.04," Nayer, one of our other writers, he's a lawyer."
2388.76,2390.52," And somehow they got on the topic of like,"
2390.52,2391.88, Russian literature.
2391.88,2394.6, So I'm sitting there and like the doctor in the lawyer are talking
2394.6,2395.7200000000003, about Russian literature.
2395.7200000000003,2398.6800000000003, And about E4 puts stupid there with your pile of DC comics.
