0.0,5.0, Hello and welcome to the CGW Quiet Storm.
5.0,7.0, I was trying something different.
7.0,9.0, It didn't really work.
9.0,10.0, We're sure.
10.0,11.0, We're sure.
11.0,13.0, So we got a laugh there.
13.0,14.0, Smooth.
14.0,15.0, Not so much the second time.
15.0,21.0," Welcome to CGW Radio for August 7th, 2006."
21.0,24.0, Not really much happened this week that I could think of.
24.0,25.0, Nothing.
25.0,30.0," We're going to have a podcast anyway, and with me are the computer gaming world editors,"
30.0,32.0, which are as follows.
32.0,35.0," Brian Scott, for a TV show."
35.0,38.0, Darren Gladstone for Windows.
38.0,43.0," Sean Elliott, probably independent, defiantly independent."
43.0,46.0," Sean, I don't have any."
46.0,49.0, And I'm direct Jeff 10.
49.0,51.0, So we're going to talk about the big news.
51.0,54.0," We'll talk about our other things like what do you plan, and we may play a little game."
54.0,57.0, Later that we talked about.
57.0,58.0, You guys are for that game.
58.0,63.0, You may spontaneously write a preview for you as we speak.
63.0,64.0, Round Robin stuff.
64.0,69.0," If there's time, this is show you how we write previews here at CGW."
69.0,75.0," But first we're going to talk about the big news that I assume everybody listening to this is heard about,"
75.0,79.0, which is that we sold our soul to Microsoft.
79.0,82.0," And how do we feel about that, guys?"
83.0,84.0, We love it.
84.0,85.0," Oh, sorry."
85.0,87.0, I was too busy counting my money.
87.0,88.0, Yeah.
88.0,89.0, Dead silence.
89.0,90.0, Okay.
90.0,92.0," Let me rephrase that, shall I?"
92.0,100.0," We made the big announcement that's been in works for almost one year now, which is that we are rebranding"
100.0,108.0, ourselves as they called the magazine that was computer gaming world will sometime in the near future be the official
108.0,111.0, games for Windows magazine.
111.0,113.0, What does that mean?
113.0,115.0, Mine sweeper on the cover.
115.0,118.0, Solid to blow out.
118.0,121.0, Three page review of verbal place.
121.0,123.0, For a full place.
123.0,126.0, I thought it was a free cell cover first.
126.0,127.0," Oh, you're right."
127.0,128.0," Oh, man."
128.0,129.0, I think I felt free cell cover.
129.0,132.0, I think the exclusive one to GameSpot on that one.
132.0,134.0, Those developers are bitches over the free cell team.
134.0,137.0, It's got to give us any good shots.
137.0,140.0, This all just every playing field with no cards on them.
140.0,142.0," Yeah, such bullshit."
142.0,143.0, Okay.
143.0,146.0, We can't do this.
146.0,147.0, Okay.
147.0,151.0," So we want to talk about what this means to you, take gamer."
151.0,154.0," What it means to us, Ted journalist."
154.0,160.0, And what it means for CGW and I don't know.
160.0,161.0, What does it mean?
161.0,163.0, Do any of us of anything to say?
163.0,166.0," Well, there's been a lot of speculation on the web."
166.0,168.0, In the past week since we made the announcement.
168.0,169.0, I don't know.
169.0,170.0, I don't know.
170.0,172.0, The one pet peeve I've had since is that a lot of people made this wrong.
172.0,175.0," A assumption that oh, oh, no, is CGW's dead."
175.0,176.0, It's all over.
176.0,178.0, It's like a seed has done.
178.0,179.0, And I don't know.
179.0,180.0, It seems like it's anything.
180.0,182.0, But we're just going to be in more places.
182.0,183.0, Right.
183.0,187.0," Let's, uh, we could back up a teeny bit and explain what all this means."
187.0,190.0," Um, what, uh, what this means."
190.0,192.0," It just shoes on though, man."
192.0,193.0, I'm falling my socks up.
193.0,194.0," Jeff, so we're here."
194.0,195.0, Pond us.
195.0,196.0, Yeah.
196.0,200.0," Well, while we while I talk, the performance are things."
200.0,208.0," Um, what what happened here is that about, uh, ten months ago now, CGW, uh, actually"
208.0,211.0," folks above me at Zif Davis, but still on the editorial staff."
211.0,213.0, So this was an editorial driven decision.
213.0,215.0, Let's get a few of the basics out of the way.
215.0,216.0, Here's a people understand.
216.0,221.0, This is not Microsoft buying the magazine.
221.0,224.0, This was not Zif Davis giving Microsoft money.
224.0,228.0," In fact, no money, believe it or not, has exchanged hands between anyone."
228.0,231.0," Um, nor will it nor will it."
231.0,233.0, This was not a financial deal.
233.0,235.0, This was how this started.
235.0,238.0, It started from our end here at Zif.
238.0,246.0," And, uh, people on the senior editorial team were frustrated by CGW's new stand presence."
246.0,252.0," Because the feeling was that the magazine had come, uh, had made great strides at"
252.0,255.0, Atari Lee and was actually a better than ever.
255.0,258.0, And this is not me just blowing smoke up my own push.
258.0,263.0," But this was actually the way it was described that and they wanted, they believed in the magazine"
263.0,264.0, More than they ever had it.
264.0,267.0, And they wanted it to appear on more new stance.
267.0,271.0," Um, for those who don't know, we actually make most of our money and we have most of our"
271.0,275.0," readers from subscribers, whereas on the new stand, not so much."
275.0,280.0," So the idea was, well, let's, let's give CGW a better new stand presence."
280.0,287.0," The problem is and was that once you have a certain new stand reputation, it's hard to get beyond that."
287.0,292.0," So in other words, if Target says, uh, well, Target, do they carry magazines, whatever."
292.0,294.0, Let me come up with the best magazine.
294.0,295.0," Yeah, yeah, sure."
295.0,296.0, Okay.
296.0,300.0," That's a good target says, uh, well, we, we take two copies of CGW a month."
300.0,301.0, Okay.
301.0,302.0, And we sell those two.
302.0,307.0," Even if Zif Davis is all gung-ho about CGW, you can't go back to them and say, hey, take 10 now."
307.0,308.0, They're better.
308.0,309.0, Let's start.
309.0,312.0," We'll just say, now we were happy with the two."
312.0,314.0," Um, so we basically hit a wall."
314.0,317.0, New stand lies because of that.
317.0,321.0," And so we started scheming, well, what could we do?"
321.0,323.0, What could we do to increase CGW's profile?
323.0,325.0, What can we do to take this magazine?
325.0,329.0," We know is good that we know readers are going to like, but actually get it out there."
329.0,337.0," And so the scheme was hatched to, uh, to come up with an official, uh, or to have CGW get this official tag."
337.0,345.0," And the same way that OPM had become the official, uh, Sony magazine for PlayStation and OXM was the official magazine for Xbox."
345.0,351.0," It was, it thought was, why can't the PC have an official magazine and why can't that be us?"
351.0,362.0," And, uh, this happened to coincide, uh, happily with, uh, Peter Moore, uh, the head of Microsoft's interaction, uh, interactive division."
362.0,369.0," His plan to, uh, increase the profile of the PC as a gaming platform."
369.0,373.0, So it was sort of a happy synchronicity between these two things.
373.0,374.0," Am I boring, you guys?"
374.0,375.0, No.
375.0,376.0, No more jokes.
376.0,377.0, More jokes.
377.0,378.0, I know.
378.0,379.0, I'm sorry.
379.0,380.0, This is a history lesson part of the past.
380.0,382.0, This is what everyone wants to hear.
382.0,387.0," I want, I just want the straight story to be out there because there is a lot of rumor in anyone"
387.0,388.0, about this.
388.0,389.0," And basically, misunderstanding."
389.0,391.0, So I want everybody to get this.
391.0,396.0," We approach Microsoft and we said, hey, we have this idea."
396.0,402.0, You guys are interested in making the PC more legit as a gaming platform and we have this
402.0,407.0," Great PC, uh, PC gaming magazine that we think can help you out."
407.0,412.0," And so it was basically seen as a win-win, uh, for both parties here."
412.0,419.0," Microsoft would be able to have this, uh, this magazine that they could say, uh, represent,"
419.0,424.0," you know, that would further sort of add to this message that they were taking PC gaming"
424.0,425.0, more seriously.
425.0,432.0," And we would have the official branding that would give us, uh, extra legitimacy and more importantly,"
432.0,436.0," exposure on new stands, um, which is what we want."
436.0,441.0," If you write for a living, uh, the most important thing to you is that people can actually"
441.0,444.0, find your articles to read them.
444.0,449.0, So those of us who spend every day here working hard are frustrated that when we get mail
449.0,453.0," from you guys, what we do all the time saying, I can't find CGW anywhere."
453.0,454.0," Well, that gets really old after a while."
454.0,456.0, We want to you to find CGW.
456.0,460.0, We want you to find our articles because we spend a lot of time working on them.
460.0,463.0," So, um, we made this deal."
463.0,467.0, And that's basically what it boils down to.
468.0,474.0," Part of the deal, if we wanted to be their official magazine was we had to take the official name of the platform,"
474.0,479.0, which fortunately or unfortunately is games for Windows.
479.0,481.0," Um, it is so sexy."
481.0,483.0, We could have a more interesting name.
483.0,484.0, It's true.
484.0,488.0," I might argue that computer gaming world, not the most dynamic name."
488.0,492.0," It's a note name, but it has been a name for 25 years."
492.0,493.0, So there's that.
494.0,500.0," Um, but, uh, you know, when we were first talking to Microsoft about this, a lot of us here"
500.0,503.0," were arguing, well, can't we just be computer gaming world?"
503.0,507.0," The official Windows gaming magazine, you know, can't we keep our own name?"
507.0,511.0," And of course, that's what we would like to do because none of us here in this room here."
511.0,514.0, I think are happy about the CGW name going away.
514.0,518.0, But that was the hard part of the deal for us was we lose the name.
518.0,522.0," We lose the name, but we gain a ton of potential readers."
522.0,526.0, Which is all anybody in the magazine business ever wants.
526.0,531.0," Um, that is kind of your boring history lesson of how it went down."
531.0,537.0," And you guys, there was that gleeful moment where we were throwing our own names around thinking that we would"
537.0,540.0," be able to, that it would fly first to call it where we wanted to."
540.0,545.0," Yeah, I was type for a was the, which will be my own, uh,"
545.0,546.0," was the, right."
546.0,548.0, We might see name now.
548.0,549.0, I'll be blue screen.
549.0,550.0," Yeah, blue screen."
550.0,553.0," That'll, that'll, well, that's like a dartboard."
553.0,555.0," That's not a nice, easy name."
555.0,557.0," G.P.F. Man, gentle protect your phone."
557.0,560.0, Maybe that back page can be blue screened a death now.
560.0,563.0, Control all the lead of the month for like the worst game.
563.0,568.0," Yeah, so, you know, so the other big question, of course, is,"
568.0,571.0," and I was about to burp is, so,"
571.0,574.0," So, I'm a little bit of a burp."
574.0,576.0, We might have to edit that out.
576.0,579.0, I'm going to have to report that error now.
579.0,583.0, We were so trying to be high-brow and man.
583.0,584.0, We're close.
584.0,587.0," Um, let's talk about the big thing."
587.0,589.0, The impartiality issue.
589.0,592.0," Okay, because obviously that is the question."
592.0,594.0, It's certainly not a new question.
594.0,597.0, This is the question at the guys at OPM and OXM face all the time.
597.0,600.0, Are we going to be beholden to Microsoft now?
600.0,603.0," Does this mean that Zutai Koon 3 is going to get, you know,"
603.0,606.0, 6 out of 5 stars now from us?
607.0,613.0, Are we going to be afraid to say how we feel is Microsoft going to tell us what to write
613.0,615.0, or pressure us or control us?
615.0,618.0, These are all the questions that we're getting.
618.0,621.0," Um, I really don't want to do a monologue here."
621.0,622.0, So somebody else took it.
622.0,623.0, It's a dirt.
623.0,624.0, Wait.
624.0,626.0, How about reviews chief?
626.0,627.0, How's that reviews?
627.0,628.0," Oh, I got it."
628.0,630.0," Well, the answer is no."
630.0,632.0, Thank you.
632.0,633.0, Thank you.
633.0,634.0, I think all the questions.
635.0,640.0," I mean, we have like, we do have like this big huge like 20 page legal contract."
640.0,642.0, And that's actually part of the deal.
642.0,643.0, Is this right?
643.0,646.0, Microsoft cannot interfere with our editorial decisions.
646.0,647.0, Right.
647.0,649.0, 100% editorial and so no.
649.0,653.0, We are not required to like Microsoft products and we will tell you.
653.0,655.0," I mean, we've had a pretty interesting history of it."
655.0,657.0," Like, you know, age three."
657.0,660.0," We were like, we were the only people that actually called out."
660.0,661.0, Right.
661.0,662.0," You know, they gave for what?"
662.0,665.0," If it ran part three just about to lower score, it got."
665.0,669.0, And we got endless amounts of crap from both Microsoft and unsupply about that.
669.0,672.0, And then we reviewed the pat and did it again.
672.0,673.0, Right.
673.0,674.0, We actually we gave the pat.
674.0,675.0, Probably a worse review.
675.0,676.0, I think so.
676.0,681.0," But but the cool, the cool and important part of that is that that's part of what Microsoft"
681.0,682.0, respects.
682.0,684.0, And that's partially why they went with us.
684.0,685.0," Um,"
685.0,690.0, I'm excited to really tell the rest of the story on the on the deal was that we came to Microsoft.
690.0,692.0, And we proposed this deal.
692.0,697.0, And we even made a mock cover back then it had a cooler name than came so
697.0,699.0," and does magazine, but whatever we called it."
699.0,700.0," Oh, actually we just cut it."
700.0,702.0, We didn't know it was gaming magazine.
702.0,703.0, Okay.
703.0,704.0, Slightly better.
704.0,708.0, At least it didn't say four.
708.0,710.0, It's that four of that's the killer.
710.0,711.0, Yeah.
711.0,714.0," You know, what other magazine that's four on the title?"
714.0,718.0, Food for eaters and that's just weddings for you.
718.0,719.0, I don't know.
719.0,720.0, I don't know.
720.0,721.0, I don't know.
721.0,722.0, Yeah.
722.0,723.0, For him.
723.0,724.0, And we don't talk about that.
724.0,725.0," If it's him, there you go."
725.0,726.0, Yeah.
726.0,727.0, That's an acronym.
727.0,728.0, Yeah.
728.0,730.0," So, okay."
730.0,733.0," So we mocked up these covers and Microsoft said, oh man."
733.0,734.0, This is a great idea.
734.0,735.0, This is awesome.
735.0,736.0, Thanks.
736.0,737.0, Yeah.
737.0,739.0, We'll get back to you a little while and see if we got a deal here.
739.0,742.0," And then they went away for a while and when they came back they said,"
742.0,746.0, This is such a great idea that we're actually going to take it.
746.0,750.0, And we're going to float it out there to various publishers and see if they're interested
750.0,751.0, too.
751.0,756.0," And then you guys can bid on it, which is standard operating procedure in any business."
756.0,759.0," You know, it's like an architectural contract, right?"
759.0,762.0," You know, you get bids for who wants to do this deal."
762.0,766.0, And so Microsoft put this out there to different publishers.
766.0,770.0," And luckily for us, they chose us."
770.0,775.0," And the reason that they cited and again, this isn't just me."
775.0,780.0, And the best thing to do is to be guessing they'll actually say it publicly themselves is because of our editorial content.
780.0,785.0, They felt that we had the the smartest and best content.
785.0,787.0, And that's what they wanted to be part of.
787.0,789.0, That's what they wanted to represent PC gaming.
789.0,795.0," And that includes our policy of being, you know, pretty tough on games."
795.0,799.0, So Microsoft isn't really interested in just doing a snow job magazine.
799.0,804.0," And in fact, if that's all they wanted to do, they have the money that they could have done that themselves."
804.0,811.0," You know, if they just wanted an in-house organ to speak the Microsoft party line, they were perfectly capable of doing that."
811.0,818.0," What they really wanted was a solid, you know, smart independent voice on PC gaming."
818.0,825.0, So now what we're asking is having said all this is that people give us the benefit of the doubt and wait and see and then judge themselves.
825.0,833.0," So if all of a sudden in the magazine, you know, CJW, just moving to games for Windows, you start seeing just because the games on the cover, we start saying, hey,"
833.0,836.0, this is probably the next world of workcraft killer.
836.0,839.0," We say, this is a likely contender for game of the year."
839.0,844.0, None of these things that we've ever said that we things that we just don't do right in the tutorial.
844.0,849.0," If that kind of stuff starts popping up, then you've got a case against us, you know, I'm sure these to come up."
849.0,852.0," Yeah, and I'm convinced that that's, I mean,"
852.0,857.0," And each of us have our own watches, I'm in, you know, doing radar and none of that's going to happen."
857.0,858.0, And that's going to happen.
858.0,863.0," I'm in Ryan Scott, his, Darren Scott, his, you know, I think we all have pretty pretty like level heads on it."
863.0,867.0," And like when it comes down to it, when you see the new magazine come out, it's going to be the same damn magazine."
867.0,871.0," It's going to look a little better and it's have a different logo, but it's all the same people involved."
871.0,873.0, Right. So let's talk about that.
873.0,876.0," Microsoft, you know, we made this deal."
876.0,881.0, We drew up a contract and now we're about to make a redesign magazine here with a new name.
881.0,884.0," But in fact, it's all the same editors."
884.0,887.0, We're about to make a five of us sitting at this table. It's the same art team.
887.0,894.0," And we're basically making the same magazine. I mean, we've been meeting about it because this is our opportunity to do things differently."
894.0,902.0," If we wanted to, but in fact, we're coming back and we're pretty much going to have everything that readers already expect."
902.0,905.0," I mean, any changes we do will be on our own."
905.0,908.0, They'll be all of our own initiative and this and that.
908.0,911.0," But like you said, we don't want to come around and do an about face."
911.0,916.0," Especially when we've got we know we have a bunch of loyal readers. No, we want to show them that."
916.0,920.0," Hey, we're definitely the same people. We're up to the same things and that."
920.0,925.0," You know, any new things we introduced or things that we had wanted to introduce regardless of what are of what we're branded."
925.0,934.0," You know, that's right. In fact, we haven't received not one shred of either order or even request from Microsoft is what to do."
934.0,937.0," They're basically like, well, keep doing what you're doing guys."
937.0,942.0," It's just here. Here's our logo, you know, and the logo in the name is the one thing that they're seeing."
942.0,944.0, The voices.
944.0,949.0," Yeah, I totally think you're right. You know, the proofs going to be in the pudding with what we do here."
949.0,956.0," But I think all five of us here are the type of people that would basically probably walk if we started getting, you know,"
956.0,963.0," you know, I mean, if I come to one year and go, hey, you know, this, this pretty few of flights him."
963.0,967.0," And his, uh, good, but you know, you really could be pushing it a little harder, Sean."
967.0,972.0, Right. I was talking to Bill Gates the other day and he doesn't like the angle you're taking.
972.0,978.0," There's some things we already, I mean, we're used to dealing with those. It's not going to come out of the blue because it doesn't take Microsoft"
978.0,985.0, branding to have to worry about these kind of issues in the games and enthusiasts press. So a lot of times you got a story with someone again.
985.0,992.0," No, don't get nervous. Anyone around the table. I'm not naming names companies or anything, but they will say we've got this idea."
992.0,998.0," We have these goals for this product. And it's always in terms of promotion and product, whereas we see things in a much different light, right."
998.0,1006.0," And sometimes things will get pushed you know, they'll say, well, you know, we're not going to give you this if you're not in keeping with this and every single time."
1006.0,1014.0," But a scenario like that has a reason we've said, okay, well, we respect that. We're just going to drop the coverage on it. We can't operate under those conditions."
1014.0,1021.0," Right. And then in more cases than not, almost all cases they turn around and say, okay, that's fine. We'll do it this way."
1021.0,1034.0," Or that actually can't think of any case where like, I mean, when they said, okay, they just walked away from the table altogether. Right. Right. I mean, you know, I mean, you hear about it in the building certain, you know, when offers are made for first review covers and stuff like that."
1034.0,1039.0, That's something we're entirely free from because we don't do first reviews for partially for that reason.
1039.0,1048.0," But you know, you've heard you, we've already the cases where, you know, hey, we're not going to commit to give you give X company the first look if you can't tell us what the score is going to be in the game."
1048.0,1053.0, Right. That's just all stuff that we C. J. W. You guys are nothing to do with and we're not going to have anything to do with it.
1053.0,1062.0," And so it's not, but but being exposed to those kind of pressures isn't going to be something new either. We've all got excellent track record and dealing with it. That sort of thing."
1062.0,1068.0," And, you know, not that Microsoft's going to do it. I mean, I have no reason. We have no reason to believe that will, but just some just in general."
1068.0,1077.0," There's a good chance to know where he is. There's a good chance that they might, right? Just like every other game company does like he said, you know, sometimes we'll try to make a deal for a cover."
1077.0,1086.0," And we'll get the deal and they'll say, well, we really think that the cover should show this because that's what we're trying to push. And we have to say, yeah, well, guess what? It's our magazine."
1086.0,1093.0," Right. If you want the coverage, then we make the cover. And it's entirely possible that six months down the line or a year down line."
1093.0,1104.0," Some of my, some of my, so it's going to say, hey, now we're really trying to push a rise in nation's three and we'd really like to cover on that. Well, that's going to be kind of, it's far as I'm concerned."
1104.0,1127.0," Okay. So the game better damn be good then and worth our while. Right. And if it's not screw it. You hear that. You and Darren here that's sort of thing plenty with looking at features. You know, but from other companies, hey, we've got this game. You've got to look at it. It's great. You know, we have we were really interested in promoting it. And what you do now is you say, well, let's have a look at it. See what's going on. What's the context and then you just make that decision."
1127.0,1132.0, But entirely based on your own on the own. Yeah. Just to your own net. Right. But that's the way it's going to stay.
1132.0,1149.0," Yeah. Right. Now, I don't want it's just a sound. I mean, I don't know how we're sounding here, but I don't want it to sound like we're being defensive or or that, you know, we're protesting too much, but you know, it's just that we really, we've been did this is what's the story of our life for the last week."
1149.0,1162.0," And we knew it was going to be a big deal. And so if you're listening and you're dismayed by what's happened here and you can't believe even what we're, you know, even after hearing obviously still think we're to sell out's I hear you."
1162.0,1172.0," You know, I think we all do. We all understand what this means. And again, what we're saying is like just, you know, don't write us off yet."
1172.0,1196.0," See the issue, see the first issues and see for yourselves if we're, if we're holding up or not, you know, but but you know, you have to look at it as as not just, you know, one evil corporation, you know, made it deal with another evil corporation. What what you have here is you have, you know, five guys who are basically just like you who play games. We just happen to do it for a living."
1196.0,1204.0, And just did only in like talking about those games and telling the truth about those games and having fun with them and joking around.
1204.0,1216.0," I don't know what that was. So Mike is not listening in. Yeah, we have a problem in the sector five death grains mowling off customer service to this extransformation chamber."
1216.0,1227.0," And you know, we're all the conspiracy stuff just doesn't actually relate at all to our day to day existence here. And if you listener we're on our magazine, you'd be in the same position."
1227.0,1235.0, But it is a damn job. It's an international position for us to find ourselves in because I think that there is a innate and very healthy skepticism for anything branded official.
1235.0,1243.0," In the same way, like say, uh, all of a sudden, you know, car driver is suddenly a Ford charger makers official car and driver."
1243.0,1246.0," You know, actually, I mean, you're going to you're going to take any article with the grain of salt."
1246.0,1255.0," You know, actually, that's something I was just talking to some random people about this over the weekend. And I think that to the enthusiast, you know, readers who, you know, hardcore gamers."
1256.0,1264.0," You know, official doesn't have quite the street cred. But when you look to the mainstream readers, I guess, you know, more people who just reach out magazine."
1264.0,1270.0," I'm making a can reach out, right there. Yeah. They actually turn to that and go, oh, it's the official magazine. I want to read that one."
1270.0,1275.0," Yeah, well, that's the feedback we got in in focus groups from folks who don't read gaming."
1275.0,1282.0, It's like the official Marvel superheroes. You know what? It's not the handshoeing Mexico spider-man. That's got like purple webbing.
1282.0,1297.0," Yeah, I mean, I'm hoping that we're not going to lose our longtime readers who we love. I'm going to understand it if we do if people decide, I can't handle the branding or whatever."
1297.0,1300.0, They don't know how to do it.
1300.0,1305.0," You do know that or but now we have the, now we have the, now we don't, you know, the old CGW is still going to be."
1305.0,1310.0, Microsoft is going to let me do that clearly. This guy is not on Microsoft payroll.
1310.0,1318.0," It's kind of PR. A buttercup every what 10 minutes. No, I can't have that cook before we put it."
1318.0,1320.0, I don't know.
1320.0,1325.0," Well, just, I, I'm just going to throw this one. I've been reading the magazine since issue two and it broke my heart a little"
1325.0,1331.0," known that the name had a change, but in the end, I think it's going to be for the best. And I mean, we're going to keep our selves on us, but it's also to"
1331.0,1339.0," job with the readers to stick with us and keep us honest. Right. And you know, if long as you keep a dialogue open, just, you know, tell us."
1339.0,1347.0," It is. Yeah, it's going to be interesting though, because say, for example, you know, Microsoft games to do this next game is legitimately in true"
1347.0,1352.0," dollar. Don't even get, we are always going to be in these, these binds."
1352.0,1357.0," Well, that's the trade number. That's what I'm going to scare to that is, you know, you, I mean, you'll see it, you know,"
1357.0,1364.0," Metacritic and all these other things will show us up in these cases, but it's just something that we all, I mean, that's the price that comes with official"
1364.0,1368.0," Don't know. Well, we'll just have a competition. Give it a shit. You're doing it."
1368.0,1373.0, I can't what they say. That's right. H3 expansion is going to suck no matter what.
1373.0,1378.0," I mean, you do, you do set yourself up for ad hominins, you know, and in a way where they become, you know,"
1378.0,1383.0," well, it must happen with opiaminol exam all the time. Right. It's got to be, I mean, interesting to those guys,"
1383.0,1388.0," to especially don't piano. I can't vouch for for the other guys. I don't, you know, don't fall into closely, but"
1388.0,1395.0," I mean, I know an opium, they, they interview Microsoft people. They're very harsh, and they had a cover story on why the PSP is bombing."
1395.0,1402.0," So, so clearly they have, you know, they had, in my perspective, one of, one of red, they have a pretty good track record of"
1403.0,1409.0," making it clear that they're not, you know, on Sony's payroll. In fact, my understanding is that PSM has a better relationship with Sony."
1409.0,1415.0," They do. Actually it's exactly like, there's still a perception that opium is totally on the take as, you know, right."
1415.0,1421.0," Because they're official. I got a, I got a call of all things where reader asking me a question and then run up an opium,"
1421.0,1424.0," and they thought that opium is not trustworthy. They're like, right."
1424.0,1428.0, But that's going to happen to us every day for the rest of our lives in the actual word.
1428.0,1440.0," And in the same way that all of our, you know, rival publications are going to rebrand themselves as the fiercely independent unadulterated unsweet, you know, right."
1440.0,1446.0," But again, the proof is in the pointing. Let's, I mean, I think when the time comes, you can compare us page for page."
1446.0,1452.0, And I'm absolutely convinced that certain things are going to be pretty much.
1452.0,1456.0," I don't think anybody in this room here is going to, is going to start, you know,"
1456.0,1460.0," and I'm going to Microsoft and if they do, then, you know, I'm going to write."
1460.0,1462.0, I'm a dump in the house. I'm a dump in the house.
1462.0,1466.0," Ryan, so long with the career advancement in place."
1466.0,1468.0," What do you think Microsoft, what do you think?"
1468.0,1469.0," Microsoft, Ryan."
1469.0,1475.0," Obviously we're not antagonistic toward them, but not, not any more or less than any other company that we've been working for."
1475.0,1477.0," We're working with, sorry."
1477.0,1480.0," Oh, there's a lot of left."
1481.0,1483.0, You did hear anything.
1483.0,1484.0, Huh?
1484.0,1486.0, So you didn't hear anything.
1486.0,1492.0," But yeah, but the bit I don't know, I guess I'm just going to remind you that we are in a certain mode right now where we've been."
1492.0,1497.0," We've had the past, you know, what four days to stew and the, the worse the internet can throw at us."
1497.0,1503.0," And so we are kind of in a defensive mode right now, especially, you know, some of this, I mean, you've been on, you know,"
1503.0,1506.0, you've been in touch with all this from the beginning.
1506.0,1515.0," And then we've got some of us like me, it's kind of like, yeah, I come back from visiting on the cover story and then all this is blowing up and getting all these aims from other people in the industry that I'm friends with."
1515.0,1520.0," And and they're all like, you know, Darren, well, we were away in an undisclosed city on this cover story."
1520.0,1522.0," He's uh, what is it?"
1522.0,1528.0," Like, it starts blowing up, you know, like, even when you sell out, but everyone's asking me like, how do you feel about it?"
1528.0,1536.0," Because the people that are writing me and know me are assuming that like, because of my temperament, my way of working that I'm going to be fundamentally opposed to it."
1536.0,1539.0," You know, right, they're all writing me these sort of like, don't want things like, hey, man, are you right?"
1539.0,1540.0, I'm getting the same thing.
1540.0,1544.0," You know, hey, wait a second, you make me a shell like, I thought it was going to be a shell out, you sure."
1544.0,1546.0," Well, we know, we're not Darren's okay with us."
1546.0,1548.0, You can probably get a free action.
1548.0,1554.0," Yeah, they're, they're just sending you like, hey, man, can you get me a, hey, copy of what's that?"
1554.0,1556.0," I'm like, I'm like, I'm healing you too."
1556.0,1558.0," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
1558.0,1567.0," Yeah, no, I basically spent, you know, the last six days just like searching all over for message boards, you know, bring in the hate to us and trying to talk to people."
1567.0,1572.0," And then we lost my cool, what, once twice twice three times, yeah, a moron."
1572.0,1573.0, I'm not even that bad.
1573.0,1574.0, Yeah.
1574.0,1578.0," But, you know, it's nothing we didn't expect."
1578.0,1582.0," This is a big, big deal for a long time readers of CGW."
1582.0,1583.0, We know that.
1584.0,1592.0," I guess I should also say I had a pretty nice exchange with Johnny Wilson who was the, not the first editor in chief."
1592.0,1598.0," Actually, it was the second, but I think he's the name most closely associated with CGW's past."
1598.0,1606.0, And he had been interviewed for a website who I don't want to name by name because I can't stand them.
1606.0,1617.0," But he, but, you know, he offered words that were, you know, they were a little kind of bitter about Zif Davis selling out the name in a way."
1617.0,1622.0," I shouldn't say sell because there was not money, but getting rid of the name CGW."
1622.0,1626.0, And he and I had a back and forth about it over email.
1626.0,1630.0," And, you know, we basically got his, his best wishes."
1630.0,1641.0," And he certainly is a business man among all other things and he understands the good that this means for us because when he was here, we were already behind the eight ball news stand wise."
1641.0,1644.0, And he understands what this means.
1644.0,1652.0," Also, I should say that, you know, really, you can think of it any PC gamer can see this as kind of a cool thing for PC games, right?"
1652.0,1659.0," I mean, you've got Microsoft first of all on their own trying to pump up the platform and make it more legit."
1659.0,1662.0, Pop up the platform.
1662.0,1677.0," And, you know, having an official mag is part of that, you know, it's a way of sort of just like elevating this to the level of Xbox and PS2, which those of us who've been PC gamers forever appreciate."
1677.0,1684.0," Elevate the art form even higher yet, like sculpture to chip it."
1684.0,1685.0," Yeah, exactly."
1685.0,1687.0, You're talking me.
1687.0,1689.0, I had to throw that up there.
1689.0,1691.0, I shut up for cheapets.
1691.0,1694.0," Well, they probably overly blabbed here about the stopping."
1694.0,1697.0," No, I think this is the topic right now."
1697.0,1702.0," I mean, you could tell us about Ryan could tell us about Guild Wars or weekend in the escrow."
1702.0,1703.0," No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
1703.0,1704.0, Never mind.
1704.0,1707.0, I'm just saying that this is the GW podcast front of here.
1707.0,1714.0," Yeah, actually, I do think we're probably going to keep talking about this for a while over the weeks and I do encourage your questions to us on the mess."
1714.0,1717.0," On the message board, right, you know, bring them on."
1717.0,1725.0," Don't don't be afraid to ask us the hard ones because we got nothing to hide here, you know, this is we're we're not blowing smoke here."
1725.0,1731.0," This is we're, you know, we're going into this with our eyes open and we're pretty happy about it actually."
1731.0,1732.0, I got to say.
1732.0,1734.0, But they're easier to answer questions of bed.
1734.0,1736.0," You know, is this the end of the podcast?"
1736.0,1742.0," Is this the end of, you know, some of their favorite columns in the magazine and answered all those as no, you know,"
1742.0,1748.0," it's going to be won't be CGW radio, but whatever we call it, it's going to be the same sexy time."
1748.0,1750.0, Favorite in column this remain.
1750.0,1752.0, Tom and Bruce will still be there.
1752.0,1755.0, I'll just be doing mind sweeper every month.
1755.0,1757.0," But hey, they'll be there."
1757.0,1759.0, So that's funny.
1759.0,1762.0, That would be a funny way to kick the first one.
1762.0,1765.0," So when he said, we would not get that no, they wouldn't."
1765.0,1766.0," Oh, my God."
1766.0,1769.0," Imagine if you just picked up, you know, you had no idea."
1769.0,1773.0, You had no history of CGW pick up a magazine call official games for windows and you look in.
1773.0,1777.0, You see a three page story on two guys playing white sweeper.
1777.0,1783.0," No matter how funny these guys are, I mean, you have to get, I don't think you get to the part where you actually read what they have to say about it."
1783.0,1785.0, You'd see mine sweeper screens.
1785.0,1786.0, Yeah.
1786.0,1787.0, The wreck.
1787.0,1789.0," You know, there's lots of busy games that look worse."
1789.0,1790.0, They're falling.
1790.0,1792.0, Especially the new vestibites.
1792.0,1794.0," Oh, yeah, the new vestibites."
1794.0,1796.0, You play the 3D chess game.
1796.0,1797.0, That's a tight and chest three.
1797.0,1798.0, Tight and chest three day man.
1798.0,1799.0, That's hot.
1799.0,1800.0, Yeah.
1800.0,1801.0, I just stifled my third burp.
1801.0,1802.0, I don't know.
1802.0,1803.0," You might as I mean, are you?"
1803.0,1807.0," How can you just, you know you're on the air and you just come in and I'm going to release."
1807.0,1810.0, That's like your wife's got her friends over for night for dinner or whatever.
1810.0,1811.0," First, I'm kind of meeting."
1811.0,1818.0," And you just walk into the kitchen, grab a beer out, tear ass, and then just hit your socks, casually walk back into the bedroom."
1818.0,1820.0," Why do you, why do you criticize me?"
1820.0,1824.0," I'm just asking if that's, well, so I wouldn't do that in front of my wife's friends."
1824.0,1825.0, Okay.
1825.0,1827.0," But in front of your listeners, though."
1827.0,1829.0," Yes, I will do it right in their ears."
1829.0,1830.0, And that's part of it.
1830.0,1834.0, It's like in stereophonic like that's almost like a skin fart.
1834.0,1835.0, Okay.
1835.0,1839.0, I'm saying that to everyone listening.
1839.0,1841.0," I'm sorry, I burped."
1841.0,1842.0, I had to bring it there.
1842.0,1843.0, I really.
1843.0,1845.0, And you had to bring it up there with a skin fart.
1845.0,1848.0," And in fact, somebody on a website said that that's what we do."
1848.0,1853.0," That we tell you know, you know, that you're bad jokes."
1853.0,1855.0, Skin farting your face every week.
1855.0,1856.0, And there I went and I burped.
1856.0,1857.0," I proved, I proved them right."
1857.0,1859.0, We're too low brow here.
1859.0,1860.0, We are the Howard Stern.
1860.0,1861.0, Right.
1861.0,1863.0," Bring it, bring us back to seriousness that look on your face."
1863.0,1865.0, Can I say something intellectual?
1865.0,1867.0, We're not pleased.
1867.0,1870.0, And that's a little bit more.
1870.0,1872.0, How would you describe your feelings at this moment?
1872.0,1875.0, Johnny Wilson would not have burped on the podcast.
1875.0,1877.0," But he would have talked about care, guard."
1877.0,1878.0, He would have.
1878.0,1880.0, That's the thing.
1880.0,1882.0, I think there's a place for look at Joyce.
1882.0,1884.0, There's a place for burps and farts no matter how high brow you go.
1884.0,1885.0, Yep.
1885.0,1888.0," And anyway, that's the fact that's my purpose."
1888.0,1889.0, That's my purpose.
1889.0,1894.0, My birth wasn't homage to Ulysses.
1894.0,1896.0, Okay.
1896.0,1897.0, Okay.
1897.0,1902.0, Anyone else stuff to add to the games for Windows legacy?
1902.0,1906.0, I guess we could talk about timing a little bit.
1906.0,1912.0, Right now we're looking at the December issue of what happened in CGW being the
1912.0,1914.0, December issue.
1914.0,1918.0," Unless we have a further update for you here, that is how it's going to be."
1918.0,1920.0, So we're actually working on October.
1920.0,1921.0, October.
1921.0,1925.0, So we're talking about two more issues of CGW as it was.
1925.0,1928.0, And then games are Windows magazine being the December issue.
1928.0,1929.0, Right.
1929.0,1932.0, I don't think many people have seen September get so that's three.
1932.0,1934.0, Three issues of CGW to go.
1934.0,1938.0, So you have lots of time for this all to to settle in and rattle around your brain.
1938.0,1941.0, Remember how we all hate it and made fun of we.
1941.0,1944.0, Maybe it's so maybe this will be another one of those.
1944.0,1945.0, Maybe it's a good idea.
1945.0,1947.0, I think any of the matter how screwy can become common play.
1947.0,1949.0," I mean, it gets to the point like any any word."
1949.0,1951.0, You know that fundamental disconnect.
1951.0,1952.0, Yeah.
1952.0,1954.0," Where you're like, you say any given word enough times."
1954.0,1956.0, Like what does that even mean?
1956.0,1957.0, So I will absorb it.
1957.0,1962.0," I mean America absorbed UBO, UGO, and all these other Pokemon and nonsense names."
1962.0,1964.0," You know, this one's obviously."
1964.0,1966.0," I mean not Japanese based, but."
1966.0,1969.0," Well, I mean, Microsoft 360 we laughed at that one."
1969.0,1970.0, I want to camp.
1970.0,1971.0," I mean, I laughed."
1971.0,1972.0," Yeah, that's true."
1972.0,1973.0, That's totally.
1973.0,1974.0, Not accepted.
1974.0,1977.0, 360 did totally around the world.
1977.0,1978.0, Whoo.
1978.0,1979.0, Great.
1979.0,1980.0, That's good.
1980.0,1984.0," Like, it no matter how you slice it, though, games for Windows doesn't roll off the"
1984.0,1985.0, thought.
1985.0,1986.0, Right.
1986.0,1987.0, Yeah.
1987.0,1988.0," Well, we had in California the 360 burrito."
1988.0,1990.0, The name of a taco taco chain.
1990.0,1992.0, I was always going to go.
1992.0,1994.0," I'm just saying like, I think that's three six."
1994.0,1996.0," You know, like, when you go, you."
1996.0,1997.0, Amen.
1997.0,1999.0, I need a 360 burrito.
1999.0,2001.0," Anyway, how does that help us?"
2001.0,2003.0, Just because we need it.
2003.0,2007.0," We've got people to say that with the straight face or like, denny's items."
2007.0,2008.0, We got it easy.
2008.0,2009.0, We're certainly.
2009.0,2010.0, Moons over my home.
2010.0,2011.0, Yeah.
2011.0,2012.0, People over my home.
2012.0,2014.0, The official magazine done.

2017.0,2018.0, They ordered it.
2018.0,2019.0, They said it.
2019.0,2020.0, Right to the server.
2020.0,2021.0, I ordered that.
2021.0,2022.0, Just like in first.
2022.0,2023.0, Just like it.
2023.0,2024.0, I don't think we can get it.
2024.0,2025.0, I'm hungry.
2025.0,2026.0," However, that could be another thing we could ask to listen to."
2026.0,2029.0, We have a better name for the magazine.
2029.0,2030.0, Put it on the M.
2030.0,2031.0, That'll be the first meal bites.
2031.0,2032.0, Shecky.
2032.0,2033.0," Oh, yeah."
2033.0,2034.0, For the first issue.
2034.0,2035.0, You can check.
2035.0,2036.0, Shecky.
2036.0,2037.0, Shecky.
2037.0,2038.0, Shecky.
2038.0,2039.0, Shecky.
2039.0,2040.0, The magazine.
2040.0,2041.0, There's the first one.
2041.0,2042.0, There you go.
2042.0,2043.0, That's my vote.
2043.0,2045.0, Riding you give any ideas for magazine name.
2045.0,2046.0, Hell yeah.
2046.0,2047.0, The makes up with ninjas.
2047.0,2050.0, We were talking about calling it live.
2050.0,2052.0, We were talking about that.
2052.0,2053.0, We were talking about that.
2053.0,2054.0, I was getting behind.
2054.0,2057.0, We could full some Republicans in the buying it too.
2057.0,2059.0, That can't be true.
2059.0,2062.0, A lot live could have been because of live anywhere.
2062.0,2066.0, But then I started people were pronouncing live and then they would think it was like
2066.0,2068.0, some retired persons.
2068.0,2070.0, I all have been different.
2070.0,2073.0, I want to live.
2073.0,2075.0, I'll buy this magazine.
2075.0,2079.0, It's all about the cryo cryotains and stuff.
2080.0,2081.0, It's a really good story.
2081.0,2084.0, It's the latest review of the cryo 2000.
2084.0,2087.0, Why are these games in here?
2087.0,2089.0, Chains and so maybe patients.
2089.0,2092.0, Maybe it were better after it's gone and games are when it does.
2092.0,2094.0, It's pretty strange to know what you're getting.
2094.0,2098.0," Of course, you know, the big argument is Microsoft is pushing this."
2098.0,2099.0, This is the name of the platform.
2099.0,2101.0, But is anyone going to call that?
2101.0,2104.0," I mean, we could say this now while we're still CGW."
2104.0,2106.0, I'm just kidding.
2106.0,2107.0, We could say it then too.
2108.0,2109.0, It's a successful.
2109.0,2111.0," I mean, and we have some of you."
2111.0,2114.0, If you have seen the chaos that they're certain rollout or.
2114.0,2116.0," Yeah, you know, you got boxes that say the same thing."
2116.0,2119.0, You've got the the sections and then you can go up and play demo.
2119.0,2120.0, Right.
2120.0,2121.0, Petsy.
2121.0,2124.0, But what I'm asking is you're in the store with your buddies.
2124.0,2126.0, And you're trying to decide which.
2126.0,2128.0, Spunner sell to buy.
2128.0,2131.0," So you're going to go, hey, you're going to buy that for Xbox or games for Windows."
2131.0,2132.0, What about?
2132.0,2134.0, Like to say PC.
2134.0,2135.0, Right.
2135.0,2137.0," Well, you say PC or maybe which is Windows."
2137.0,2138.0, Sure.
2138.0,2141.0, What about are we going to say the first TV ads for games for Windows?
2141.0,2144.0, And we want to ask TV commercial you suffer a PC game.
2144.0,2145.0, I don't want to much TV.
2145.0,2146.0," I mean, TV."
2146.0,2148.0, You're a TV or I passed.
2148.0,2150.0, But I think like any time you do see a commercial for a game.
2150.0,2153.0, It's usually like a multi platform deal.
2153.0,2155.0, So I have like a billion logos and like.
2155.0,2156.0," Oh, do the late night."
2156.0,2159.0, Have you seen the late night one for Star Wars galaxies for the.
2159.0,2160.0," Oh, yeah."
2160.0,2161.0, Yeah.
2161.0,2162.0, It's just.
2162.0,2163.0, Yeah.
2163.0,2164.0, It was like a romco commercial.
2164.0,2165.0, It's like a romo from the.
2165.0,2166.0, 1989.
2166.0,2168.0, Say the universe.
2168.0,2169.0, A huge on it.
2169.0,2170.0, And then like they show like all the hard.
2170.0,2171.0, It's hard to can.
2171.0,2172.0, It starts games.
2172.0,2173.0," Yeah, you can get."
2173.0,2174.0," I mean, yeah."
2174.0,2177.0, But there's no so weak games that you get in the big in the big package.
2177.0,2178.0, And that's not all.
2178.0,2179.0," Yeah, but it's."
2179.0,2180.0, It's.
2180.0,2181.0, Don't get planet side.
2181.0,2183.0, Matrix online.
2183.0,2184.0, It's.
2184.0,2185.0, To the.
2185.0,2188.0," CG, you know, the overblown stuff like the Call of Duty ads."
2188.0,2189.0, And the final fantasy ads.
2189.0,2191.0, It's just it's just straight like.
2191.0,2192.0, Like.
2192.0,2195.44," Yeah, like no lie about it like this yes this looks like butt but this"
2196.16,2198.16, You know
2200.16,2202.16, Looks like butt cost like butt
2204.0,2208.56, But you get to be a rookie. I wonder if that was successful. I don't know it runs really late night too
2208.56,2212.16, So it's like the the fools that are you know call the sex lines and stuff for like
2212.56,2214.4, Damn that's cheaper that's cheaper
2215.04,2219.8, I didn't I didn't want one payment. I could have this phone sex or I could get yeah
2219.8,2225.32," Tellers get he's burned yeah, as a movie. Oh, that's sorry for on game. Oh, nice"
2226.6000000000004,2228.6000000000004, I'm sorry Mr. Teller. Yeah
2230.84,2235.6000000000004," Whoa, I don't know where that came from what is that? I don't know you trying to save it"
2235.6000000000004,2238.44, I don't know like herself told you to say that
2239.0800000000004,2243.1200000000003," So well, Microsoft they're trying to brand windows is like the big platform now"
2243.4,2246.4, They are trying to get us to call it window instead of PC
2247.04,2252.0," Well, we do call windows but I mean, but it's it's the gaming part"
2252.0,2258.2000000000003," It's that I think the part doesn't quite roll off the tongue. Yeah, right? I mean I've never said I play a game for windows"
2259.4,2261.4, What if you just say I will now
2264.04,2266.04, I think it was in a window
2268.56,2270.58," Okay, I mean are you ever gonna say a"
2271.48,2273.48, Windows gamer
2273.92,2275.92," Well, I wouldn't say I'm a Linux gamer"
2277.04,2282.7400000000002, That's true or a Mac gamer all the technically go play windows on a Mac but whatever all the lines are blurring
2283.48,2285.56," Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry"
2285.56,2290.32, You can have games on windows on a Mac else that we gain for windows. It won't be a PC
2290.32,2293.56," Oh, that's an obvious. I'll be really. I'll be really in Macs in the magazine when I see that new eye Mac"
2293.56,2296.84, I'm not saying that much so what are we gonna do about our Linux coverage?
2297.84,2303.28," Right, that's right. Yeah, I chose kind of curious before the podcast and went over to touch games"
2303.28,2307.6400000000003, I come to see like what kind of you know hot new games that new hotness they have up there
2307.6400000000003,2310.88, Uh-huh among the top 10 list is like Elvis and Tari and right
2311.6400000000003,2318.5600000000004," It was actually I think the other magazine should follow suit. You know, so a PC gamer could be like the official Linux gaming magazine"
2319.1200000000003,2322.4, And computer games could be like the official math gaming magazine
2322.4,2327.46, So we all you know represented different platform. That's my challenge to those guys
2329.0,2331.2000000000003, You know like you're ready to step up
2333.28,2340.02, You're excited I've seen there's some people in our form who have asked like what about like Mac and Linux games
2340.02,2346.84," Right, it's a good question. We have whatever I can I can speak for experience on a Linux thing since I was a big Linux"
2346.84,2348.84, Panadic for about six years
2348.84,2352.1800000000003," If you're playing games on Linux, but the hell is wrong with you"
2353.44,2356.2000000000003, And there you have it that make a great box quote
2357.5600000000004,2360.0600000000004, Ryan Scott for windows magazine
2360.7,2365.7799999999997," Yeah, I don't I don't play the game on it as far as a mac games. I mean"
2365.7799999999997,2374.02, I don't know I was a bad gamer back in the day just photos. I wanted that I really want to play actually and I thought reviewed on the game life
2374.7,2380.42, The the internet video show show show show and it was like wing nut two or something wing
2380.42,2385.42, That's it but it looks like a 3D like you know update to the old 1942 style game
2385.42,2389.5, But with like using the full graphics power the Mac and it looks pretty pretty cool
2389.5,2393.2400000000002," All right, hey, you know I can back you staff some great games the marathon series"
2393.2400000000002,2394.7400000000002, I'll re-punch it up with the Mac
2395.94,2397.94, Bungie was a Mac
2397.94,2400.58, Mac gaming house. I didn't the old days. Wasn't this yeah
2400.94,2406.58, The Santa roots I think started on the Mac. I think right about that. It's day I mean I started on the Apple 2 and worked up from there
2406.58,2410.86, I just at some point like when it went it went to like Mac gaming just screeched to a halt. I mean
2410.86,2413.02," Oh, God, well, it's been a long time now"
2413.02,2420.66," I think like what 86 no, no, I went on longer than that. I mean when I started it's not like in 97"
2420.66,2422.66," Yeah, I was like he still did some"
2423.2599999999998,2429.06, Mac stuff. I mean interplay had their Mac play division. Mm-hmm. They were just at least a few
2430.2599999999998,2431.2599999999998, Not many
2431.2599999999998,2435.04," Yeah, I'm just trying to remember like I remember up until like 93 I was playing stuff on an apple"
2435.04,2438.46, I think the answer to that question actually is that
2439.1,2445.44," You know, we don't really cover that stuff anyway, right? I mean the amount of pages we've devoted to Mac or"
2446.34,2450.06, Linux games over the years of what one page total?
2450.06,2454.06, Maybe if that if that and that same kind of
2455.02,2457.02, Sterling coverage is probably what you can expect
2458.78,2461.26," Which is just to say that yeah, I mean if you're if you're a"
2462.02,2465.06, Linux enthusiast you weren't subscribing to CGW for you
2465.06,2468.34, We're reading those needs in the first place. That's right. We weren't we weren't nothing against it
2468.34,2471.42, But it's just like it wasn't the magazine for you in the first place
2471.42,2473.86, So it's not as though the change is going to
2474.42,2475.7, Suddenly leave you out in the cold
2475.7,2480.62," Right, I mean if if I mean if we were covering like you know Mac and Linux stuff before and then all of a sudden magically overnight"
2480.62,2482.54," I covered dried up to become the win, you know"
2482.54,2489.7," You know official game windows magazine then yeah, I'd say we're sell outs right right and in fact a lot of the internet comment is saying that"
2489.7,2492.66, You know when people reason it through it they're like well gee
2492.66,2495.22, I guess that's our really they cover was windows gaming anyway
2496.8599999999997,2503.18, Or games for windows I guess I have to say TM the other thing that added I think to to the
2503.7,2508.8599999999997, The conspiratorial slant to this whole announcement is that it was what you know a week after E3 kind of
2509.8199999999997,2516.3399999999997," Transformed into whatever whatever it's gonna be this next year. You know, and so everyone's looking at these for you know signs and"
2516.34,2522.02," Portments it's like the cover for national choir, you know no stradomas says that this is the end of the world"
2522.02,2524.02," You know, so this is the this is the"
2524.7400000000002,2528.82, For as foretelling the next big in district crash or something so I don't know
2528.82,2534.9, I've seen a lot of that I mean it's people definitely putting together E3 down C. GW down like it's like what's next?
2534.9,2538.46, You know right actually there was something else they kind of got under my skin too
2538.46,2542.8, There was like this flawed reporting that was out there last week that we was trying to combat it that's saying how
2543.32,2547.1600000000003, Not only did we change our name that we're getting free computers from Microsoft man
2547.1600000000003,2549.6400000000003, That was totally new to be that was
2550.6000000000004,2556.76, Where did that come that well you know like they came they came from a little Jason cross was talking about on the quarter to three threads
2557.0800000000004,2560.88, How Jason cross again is I'm sorry with extreme tech
2560.88,2563.04, It also does our tech section some of the time
2563.04,2569.1600000000003," I know just for the reader for the readers for the people's here no, but what happened was he was talking about how"
2569.6000000000004,2571.6000000000004, Microsoft sent us
2571.6,2574.64," Well, not just us I should say they sent people"
2575.44,2580.12, Basically the equivalent of debug PC is it kind of a standard test based for test the out windows Vista and
2581.56,2582.88, We got one
2582.88,2585.68, CW got one extreme tech's getting one one up
2586.2,2595.08, PC gamer has went on the way even the even the original places that reported this are on the list to get these machines right and and just again for clarification for readers
2595.96,2597.96, magazine some websites that cover
2598.32,2602.88, Placetian games and Xbox teams and Nintendo games they get developer boxes
2603.0,2611.04, So that they can look at games while they're still in progress because they went at run on commercial machines and so this was Microsoft
2611.04,2618.8, So we have doing the same thing with the PC they were telling all of the media outlets not just us that in order to run Windows
2619.2400000000002,2622.68, Vista for testing purposes to be able to write about it
2622.68,2626.16, We're gonna have to give you special machines because your current PCs can't run it
2626.16,2629.52," Well, actually, I think the message they were trying they weren't actually saying that what they were saying"
2633.8399999999997,2635.7999999999997," Well, no with they were trying to say with the"
2638.64,2639.8399999999997, Who broke
2639.8399999999997,2642.56, Dammit no actually what they were trying to say was
2643.12,2649.2799999999997, They want to have a standardized test bed so they could you know say here's the experience you could expect with the this level of machine
2649.68,2654.08," Okay, so it is a control test. I can troll test group right"
2654.36,2661.06, But that got misinterpreted online as CDW became the Microsoft magazine and now they all get free PCs
2661.84,2666.4, Which was ludicrous I'm still playing on a 9800 for the record so
2668.24,2671.36, I know that's was the list of pity a lot of people like you
2672.0,2678.56," To me was you upgrade I have a 6800 oh yeah, say yeah, but you you've got the Nvidia though"
2678.88,2683.04," Yeah, I am gonna just hit up my buddy. We're about to say we're in the same level"
2683.2799999999997,2685.92, I have a water cooled turbo jet
2686.56,2693.4," You know, but yeah, so that really pissed me off this weekend because I guess as a former hard news journalist"
2693.4,2698.12, I guess whatever I mean I I actually fact check my sword. You know my sources when I write before I write a story and
2698.4,2700.4, You just go up and I guess the problem with
2700.96,2705.2, Websites block sites whatever is that you're such in such a hurry to get up online and scoop everyone else
2705.2,2711.54, You don't bother doing your basic reporting skills. Well the the few times that I've lost my temper or patience this past week
2711.54,2716.18, Since the announcement has been for that exact reason. It's when I read reports online and
2717.06,2723.54, Basically they've like interviewed other people and you know not me or anyone anyone at Zif Davis at all
2723.7,2728.46," And it's like hi, I'm sitting kind of right here on email on the phone and if you had a question"
2728.46,2731.38, You could have asked me and actually I'm still putting that out there
2731.7799999999997,2736.12, If anybody out there is like running a website or any kind of source and they have questions
2736.2799999999997,2738.2799999999997," Yeah, no or to find me"
2738.2799999999997,2740.2799999999997," Yeah, we're all pretty easy to reach so"
2740.52,2742.52, Does that the send a question
2743.5600000000004,2746.38, Just making it easy one so in the read the free pieces
2747.0400000000004,2748.5400000000004, Next
2750.5400000000004,2754.28," All right, have we done enough of this for today? Oh, yeah, I think so"
2754.28,2762.2400000000002, But but but but like we like we've been saying please keep asking this questions because we're we're all open about this and I think over time
2762.2400000000002,2764.2400000000002, We can all see this as a good thing
2764.2400000000002,2767.52, You know the one the one big bomber here. There's just no denying
2768.04,2771.72, Well a long great awesome history for the CGW name
2772.0,2777.32, But the bigger picture is we're still here really same magazine just a new name
2777.88,2780.16, The name itself is being retired and that's it
2781.44,2786.72, Until they throw me out the last question for a couple of weeks down the road is that that people have as how are we going out?
2786.92,2790.2599999999998, Are we gonna give give the long time readers a little something special?
2790.2599999999998,2793.96, Listen something I think it's a slim thick and something riding the bomb on the way down
2797.52,2800.36, The final page that's a question. Do we do a big
2801.16,2803.16, Goodbye CGW or not?
2803.88,2805.88, I don't know that people keep right then
2807.12,2811.4, What do you want to see in the final issue of the magazine called CGW?
2811.4,2818.36, Just know we're not gonna give you all the stories of favorite interns and this and right. We're not gonna you know do our own horn tootin
2818.36,2821.7599999999998," Yeah, I mean there's stuff that we could do like we were talking like I mean"
2821.7599999999998,2826.56, If if a big magazine like rolling stone or something hits a it's an anniversary mark or something
2826.56,2830.88, And they take a serious look at what to find the magazine over the years or something. I think that's cool
2830.88,2834.7599999999998, But if it just uses a chance to pull out whatever brick a bracket and anecdotes
2834.7599999999998,2839.36, We've had sitting around about we could bring us our writers in or game developers
2840.64,2844.48, We get to go for you. I'll let other people say what they thought that's very way to do
2844.48,2848.04, I mean what do you think of me right? I think that's a pretty cool idea
2848.52,2853.7599999999998," Well, I'm sold on this. Let's do it done book it. No, actually. We actually did this for issue 250"
2853.76,2858.32, So I mean like we did a great job there. I wouldn't mind revisiting that before you go out
2858.32,2862.88, That I want to talk shit tell us what they wish all us underviews maybe we'll bring John
2863.88,2866.88, Get Johnny exactly
2866.88,2870.92," That would be that would be good. It would be an interesting read try to do that. Yeah, all right"
2871.28,2874.96, So you just said in on the editorial meeting that is a field yeah
2875.5200000000004,2880.4, That's how we I think actually got more accomplished right now. Should we let should we let Veterman write something to
2880.4,2887.84," Yeah, love your Greg love you buddy. Okay. No really I do a little too much"
2889.1600000000003,2891.1600000000003, That's getting all
2891.1600000000003,2897.2000000000003," He's sexy. Okay, so let's move on did we actually besides this did we actually play any games?"
2897.2000000000003,2901.44, I probably quickly we've been talking a long time already like an hour. I run a clean
2901.44,2905.88, I play I run a clean I play the free where game called flame war this weekend
2906.88,2907.88, Perfect
2908.2000000000003,2912.6400000000003, It's part of the experimental game play project just like real life and just like real life
2912.6400000000003,2915.48, It's kind of funny they have like like levels are broken up by websites
2915.48,2919.36, There's like something awful.com and slash dot and you go through these and basically the ideas
2919.36,2921.2400000000002, They have it's like a first person shooter perspective
2921.52,2925.76, So you actually have like this flame jet that comes out of your character and you have to flame other people
2926.1600000000003,2927.4," Wow, it's kind of weird"
2927.4,2932.36," But it's like a dopey little game, but I thought it was okay, and I seem to appropriate torture to watch them all Ryan"
2933.8,2937.2400000000002, I'm playing you still play an Eve and by playing I mean
2937.24,2938.6, I'm logged out will some
2939.24,2941.9599999999996," You mean you're playing right now. Yeah, you're still doing that"
2943.6,2947.3599999999997, Interesting new story on the GM in Yvonne line who was caught
2947.8799999999997,2949.8799999999997, Basically hooking himself up
2949.8799999999997,2953.12," Hooking his character. Oh, he had like a one-month-old character with a bunch of stuff"
2953.12,2956.8199999999997," He there was no one that it would have taken years to have acquired. Yeah, so what they do"
2956.8199999999997,2960.56, It's so how they so what do they do them just kind of kick them off that's at your fire or is there more no?
2960.56,2967.04, They're still trying to get the stuff back which is really crazy like reacquisition like they got virtual repoman in their own game
2967.7599999999998,2969.56, You know it's like it's not like they can't
2969.56,2972.7599999999998, I would delete you because it would like alter the economy or something is this stuff?
2972.7599999999998,2974.7599999999998, It's like we need to get this stuff back
2974.7599999999998,2979.6, So is that some kind of legitimately exist in this universe so we got it like reappropriate it do what we want
2979.6,2982.52, Can't they just like delete those bits and then
2983.7999999999997,2989.6, Type into new ones and they're not killing his account was sounded really I mean it's kind of cool depending on the way you look at it
2989.6,2992.4399999999996, It's like we're gonna take the stuff back. He's obviously not gonna be a GM
2992.84,2997.2000000000003, But he's gonna just have to be another local with a one month old account
2997.32,3002.44," So this was like a glitch in the matrix, but that's a good way of punishing them. You know, it's like people"
3002.44,3007.04," Watch by you know, he's in this little like crapy starship and they're like hey"
3007.68,3010.88, You're the glue ripped off all that stuff those stupid punk
3015.88,3018.76, Interstellar repoman like a tow truck that's gonna come over and try to like
3018.76,3024.36, You can set bounties on people in the game. There's a lot of good
3024.36,3028.48," But if you want them right now, I bet and that's the stuff that makes me think that that game is rad"
3028.48,3033.44, But if it really just amounts to a bunch of like you type in all the stuff in so it's basically fanfic
3033.44,3036.94, We know we're talking about like repoman cruising through these red three
3038.94,3041.5200000000004, And really like your group and that I got truck Paul though
3042.1200000000003,3048.7200000000003," Really though, it's just like so kind of tiger hey can I please k please can you send me that starship back along with"
3048.76,3051.76," 40,000 your token credits in"
3055.76,3057.76, We're happy to be good
3057.76,3064.0," Ralph he's not here this week. Oh, yeah, you know, I tried to play that game. I'm I don't want to do it"
3065.0,3076.48," But I don't want to but you're about to well, I know I downloaded it. I got my 14 day account and that the tutorial for that things like two hours or something"
3076.48,3082.2400000000002," It's like endless. I think I'm exaggerating. No, it is it's it's had did you you did you get out of the hanger?"
3082.2400000000002,3087.1," I got out of the hanger. I finally got my ship, but as soon as you get out that little meter"
3087.1,3089.66, Reset it puts you right back in like they
3090.4,3092.16, Finally open. It's you're going yes
3093.36,3096.16, It's based on that I go now. Let's practice talking
3099.36,3104.28," Come on yes, can you go out and play all day and she says when you do the dishes and then she opens a door"
3104.28,3106.28," Yeah, it's like"
3106.48,3114.12," Come back in like the truck come on back in yeah, so I had to go back in the hanger and really that's when I gave it up like screw it"
3114.12,3119.96, Ryan's Celus account where you've already gotten gotten psyched in and out of the hanger will start from there
3121.16,3125.12, Can I just skip it can I skip it? You could you you could would you recommend it?
3125.72,3127.72, It's probably something you need to do
3128.72,3133.2," I mean, I did I learned a few things, but you know, I wanted to play a game"
3133.2,3136.66, I was like sitting in like tutorial school. I have to learn how to write your ship
3136.66,3139.46," We see know that there's whatever, but there's a lesson like how is it like you know"
3139.46,3144.3999999999996, Wow can get it done so seamlessly and you don't even notice it and yet she's like even now
3144.3999999999996,3146.8399999999997," Oh, okay, no, birthday. I stopped burping"
3146.8399999999997,3150.12," No, but I'm just like shamed me. I know I'm here. Phantom one friend"
3151.24,3156.64," Sorry, there you go. That's like I was just gonna say just kind of funny how like a game like wow can do it so well and you don't notice it happening"
3156.8799999999997,3162.48," Then you start playing right I was thinking that while I was playing it, you know that while I was playing in quotes"
3163.2,3166.72," I was in in online school. I was thinking boy, you know"
3166.72,3170.7599999999998, They could have just let me like fly around and give me things to do and teach me as I was flying
3171.24,3174.24, Last and four getting in your spaceship
3174.96,3176.72, Champus
3176.72,3185.0, The fighting is I've heard I will be a test. I've heard that the tutorial now is light years ahead of what they used to have in the game
3185.0,3187.0," Oh, that's odd light years"
3187.0,3192.04," Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I could see you know"
3192.04,3196.56, I had glimpses of how this could be fun like an MMO in space or whatever
3196.84,3201.2," Cool, hopefully Sunday. I'll get out of the hanger really crazy thing is like when you start"
3201.2,3207.56, I know it should you let the market and had a buy stuff and all that when you really start to understand the nuances of the
3208.24,3209.84, Economy see that's another thing
3209.84,3216.88, That's when it within you know within the first 15 minutes or so I'm like they've got like three windows up on the screen and they're saying here
3216.88,3219.96, Where you'll sell your titanium or for this or whatever
3220.6,3228.88, Don't shouldn't they just put you in the spaceship in the first five minutes and let you fly around like that's what Blizzard would do and then they would introduce you to the market
3228.88,3234.56," Shit naturally like someone would come up and say hey, do you want to deposit your titanium or right?"
3234.56,3240.52," And you'd be like all right, okay, and then you do it. Yeah, I was like getting a lesson market economy within the first five minutes"
3240.52,3245.04, It's a pretty dense way to start a game. It's for sure. It is it's like reading the photos guide to
3245.84,3250.12," North Korea before you take your trip or something. Yeah, just want to get people"
3264.7599999999998,3268.72, The first couple of times I tried the game I felt the same way you did
3268.72,3271.16, I was just like screw this and stop in the middle of it
3271.44,3277.48," But once you get all the way through it once you suffer through it. Yeah, you know, I but I do believe you and I I"
3277.48,3282.96," Don't mean to harsh on the scamed that I haven't been able to play yet, but I haven't been able to play it because the tutorial"
3282.96,3286.8799999999997, So goddamn boring so I guess I am marching on it's hurt me just hearing about it
3290.3599999999997,3294.3599999999997, And in the game the game is a lot less daunting than the tutorial makes it work
3294.36,3299.96, It's a tutorial. I think we can then say the tutorial has failed
3303.56,3307.4," Spin-torial needs a tutorial. Yeah, how to play the tutorial?"
3312.4,3313.84," Yeah, Sean wedding"
3313.84,3317.96, I thought you shall but I'm doing the same like Ryan's doing the same all I'm doing the same old battlefield
3317.96,3326.08, Except all I do now is pilot helicopter of my friend Rory uses his godly TV missile skills to shoot down jets and stuff that are trying to take us out
3326.08,3333.28, You were doing that last week. I know it's like you've been now. It's like we moved to taking out the slower jets in the armored fury expansion to taking out like the J-tens
3333.28,3336.28, And the super fast ones and like the Chinese maps
3336.28,3337.8, And Kuber Damn
3337.8,3345.08," But it's just fun. It's like we just where every time you play it's like, oh man if we had this on video if we had this on video and then you just like it starts so much"
3345.88,3351.64," Awesome. It just basically ruins the game. Once you do it, at least one person then they're like and you say like ponder something"
3351.64,3355.88, Just a smart ass just because you know it's gonna like establish the stupid
3355.88,3359.7999999999997, I know you are about what am I think so every time if he ever gets a kill on you
3359.88,3367.64," He's gonna say ponder immediately to like get his get his cut, you know, give you your come up and so they do this and it's like they hit you with with a ground-based"
3367.64,3373.72, Stinger and they say ponder and you get all elaborate like no like it you know the stingers the wheelchair ramp to battlefield too
3373.72,3376.9199999999996," It's like all you had to do is point it point it as some click the button, you know"
3376.9199999999996,3382.8399999999997, We had to do all this stuff to get you and then they go and so once you undercut them you just like guarantee that you're gonna hear them
3382.8399999999997,3388.3599999999997," You let you every single time they get a kill so you're grafing is what you're doing. No, it's just playing that's like good"
3388.3599999999997,3392.9399999999996," Great thing. It's like good talk. You know, it's good. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, crap talking in game"
3393.2799999999997,3395.2799999999997, So that's what I've been doing
3395.2799999999997,3396.2799999999997, Mr. Malai
3396.2799999999997,3399.0, I'm also doing the same old same old doing wow
3399.56,3400.92, Played more of the movies
3400.92,3406.04, actually made my first like in game movie and it was absolutely absurd
3406.28,3407.8, What was it?
3407.8,3409.56, I think it was called wow
3409.56,3412.52, W-O-W exclamation point and it was about
3413.8,3416.76, I hit the random name generator. Wow that's what I call the movies
3418.52,3420.28, But like the
3420.28,3422.76, Disconnect between the movie making and the actual
3422.76,3428.28," Yeah, simulation part is like super apparent because I made that it was just a mass it was like there was like a safari girl"
3428.28,3433.7200000000003," Who was like a lesbian who got into a stage coach who turned into a werewolf and then you movie. Yeah, just sounds awesome"
3433.7200000000003,3436.36," Okay, that's what it's called wow you a boy"
3436.36,3437.7200000000003," Okay, that makes it"
3437.7200000000003,3443.5600000000004, Is they bold and bold? It's a crazy mess and then like it gets released and like the critics in the game
3443.5600000000004,3447.32, You know the quote critics they all love it and it's like the highest grossing movie the year
3447.32,3449.96, I just because they were on the take it'll play in Pioria
3452.6000000000004,3458.0400000000004, I didn't even really try I would just slap a thing together out of a test and like somehow this came out as
3458.84,3461.84, The best of all time it kind of sounds like the best of all
3466.84,3474.12," Awesome come on, you know what that has all subway chase. I think so it's like an action western zombie lesbian"
3474.92,3476.92, What else it's like Gary's mod
3479.08,3483.72, Kind of like a brotherhood of the wolf if you saw that sounds like my life brotherhood of the wolf
3483.88,3485.88, Yeah sounds like Dan Saturday night
3488.12,3490.12, Yeah
3490.12,3492.12, I'm trying to like try the wheel
3492.6,3494.6, It was kind of fun to do that but like
3495.08,3497.8, Then when once you've released it and realized it all that effort
3498.12,3503.0," But if you actually had put effort into it. Yeah, we're like wouldn't a matter you wouldn't have done any better right"
3503.16,3505.16," Yeah, it's never one grossing movie of all time"
3505.16,3508.68, I love you no matter what you do well now you got to try to make like a legit
3509.24,3514.12," boring one maybe I just got really lucky. Yeah, yeah, right. I could try that you might have just like pinged every single thing"
3514.12,3519.3199999999997, You know that they've programmed to the critics like those Sega CD make my video games you're going to play those
3520.2799999999997,3525.08," We're like yeah, Marky Mark and you get this little family video. I want a clown and I want a train"
3536.52,3540.48, You found it or now with the movies so so are you liking it you can keep playing
3541.44,3546.2400000000002, It's something compelling about it. I can't quite figure it out. It seems like what I'm playing
3546.2400000000002,3549.36, I can't really find a good stopping point because it's like always remember more thing
3549.36,3554.4, I got I could probably be taking care of is it so it's more of the same side that they actually movie making side or yeah
3554.4,3560.48, I mean the movie making like I said it seems like it could be fun it seems also like to make something good like I did more time than I really have
3561.36,3562.64, Because it's pretty
3562.64,3564.64, And you're pretty complicated stuff with it
3564.96,3566.96, We'll see still playing
3567.04,3568.96, Marky report cool
3569.12,3574.32," One thing that I do not playing yet, but I want to play I'm going to give a shout out to the mod makers at fortress forever"
3575.76,3578.8, What it maybe if anyone's interested in playing basically
3579.6,3583.04," Not a straight remake in source of team fortress classic, but"
3583.6,3585.6, Something that's more or less close with a lot of tweaks
3585.92,3591.84, Get on their website a fortress forever dot com and yell at them because they said that their beta is going to go public this week
3591.84,3596.7200000000003, And they need all the encouragement they can get that we need to play this game now and let them iterate on it later
