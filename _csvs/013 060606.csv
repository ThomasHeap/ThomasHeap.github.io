0.0,9.68, this is the cdw podcast i am jfgreen the editor and chief of computer gaming world
9.68,18.48, and with me today is the cast and crew of the magazine which include uh the following
18.48,22.240000000000002, uh shawn the way managing editor shawn the way it previews it here
22.240000000000002,26.64, darang ladstone senior editor right Scott reviews editor and on the soundboard
27.6,33.6, i was not talking he has no mic it's got but we love him anyway he has no mic and he
33.6,43.44, must scream yeah scream Scott wow that was good that was really good okay so uh we
43.44,48.64, will dive right into the to the fun at hand and i guess a lot of fun was had by uh shawn
48.64,53.68, Elliott and darang this weekend not the the others of us we maybe we had our own
53.68,58.64, fun but we didn't have the same fun that they had because what were you two guys playing tell the
58.64,65.84, folks half left two episode one and we likey we likey moocho it was a fun game and it's very good
66.56,70.4, it just i mean actually that's probably the post-challel for how episodic content should be done
70.4,76.48, it's just it feels right when you play it yes how long was it well i i did a lot of exploring
76.48,81.68, and then i stupidly missed one part early on you know where the the in the uh when you first
81.68,86.88000000000001, get trapped by the stalkers and the uh in the train car kind of thing there's like this one
86.88000000000001,90.56, hole in a train car in the in the subway that i totally missed i was like walking back and forth and
90.56,95.04, I missed it until i turned my flashlight on it so you were just in it was like walking back and
95.04,99.2, forth like oh in the black in the black subway exactly there's black right right we'd actually
99.2,105.92000000000002, let's back up so let's talk about how uh how you get this game you know why people should get it
105.92000000000002,110.56, where you go to get it because you can't buy this at the store can you some folks may not know this
111.44,115.84, not yet yeah it will be available later unless you know it's probably i don't think it is
115.84,118.48, is it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
118.48,124.32000000000001, just like same episodes uh first uh episode emergence was out the same time in stores you could do
124.32000000000001,128.96, the same here but i really i mean don't really reason to do that is if you just insist on having a hard
128.96,135.92000000000002, copy which a lot of people do and otherwise you still have to go through steam to verify and
135.92,139.83999999999997, decrypt it and everything so it's even not Biden even if you buy the hard copy yes you're not you're
139.83999999999997,144.88, not escaping that um if it's a little bit of a value just gets it's a copy there with you um
144.88,149.2, how long did it take you guys to download the episode well i didn't actually do a timer on
149.2,153.04, because i you know basically i i said it to download while i you know left for left work for the
153.04,157.27999999999997, then i started to download and by the time i was there the morning it had pre-loaded okay yeah pre-loaded
157.27999999999997,163.76, the same thing and it was cool because uh it went on uh it went global on Tuesday at 10 and you could
163.84,167.44, see all the people lined up on the message boards and then soon as you know people were decrypting
167.44,172.0, mid-paced green saying you know looking how we're decrypting 75% and then we'd all jump in and first
172.0,175.84, we were like alright let's agree to come back every other level and post impressions to get the
175.84,181.04, people that didn't buy it you know wondering uh and excited but then when there was this like five
181.04,186.95999999999998, hour silence after that it was basically all of us playing it like not one way to put it down yeah
186.95999999999998,192.32, so uh the entire time i played it all in the office that day so it didn't take that long but this is
193.2,196.4, like half-light two you know when i came out i just did not want to get away from it i was just
196.4,201.44, just into it completely i wanted to just keep playing and playing um it picks up immediately after i
201.44,207.76, mean as in seconds after the ending of half-light two um so answer some questions right off the
207.76,211.28, bad as to what happened you know i mean you didn't have to like two and you're frozen in time but
211.28,220.16, the g-man doesn't not feel at all um like uh cheap or lesser because it's
220.79999999999998,226.4, because it's episodic as opposed to you know a full on expansion say i didn't really think of it
226.4,230.64, in that respect i mean yeah basically it's i think they already like learned lessons from the first
230.64,236.24, game you know from from the first step in installment i guess and uh i mean like we were like
236.24,239.84, showing how we're going back and forth earlier about this about how just the interplay with
239.84,244.88, Alex just feels so much different and so much better from from the first half-light two it's really
244.88,248.16, tight is really tightly focused i mean they're about what's talking about in terms of being a short
248.24,251.68, story compared to the novels that are there full release games and you could see it i mean
252.56,257.6, whereas in half-light two you start off with the view the citadel and you end inside the citadel here
257.6,262.08, you start off inside the well you start off with the view but again and then you go and and by the
262.08,266.0, end of it it's the last thing you see again but something else has happened to it you know but it
266.0,271.52, it's got this really tight circular uh patterning to it and then as there and said the big focus
271.52,276.15999999999997, here is on Alex on the characterization her and then just being with this other person and it works
276.16,280.40000000000003, so well that i mean you look at her and she never says anything that makes you want to grow
280.40000000000003,284.40000000000003, or something what just i mean that's a huge compliment in the end you're gaming because anytime a
284.40000000000003,289.92, character opens is not too much you just want to turn them off you know and uh so to big ups to the
289.92,294.32000000000005, writers on that she actually felt like i mean it felt like a real person is there with you which
294.32000000000005,298.24, you kind of pulls you into the story further which i thought was a coolest part and she actually
298.24,303.52000000000004, opens her mouth too and they have really really old wars but we're getting it to it too so for
303.52,308.15999999999997, example if you just say hey let's have this this woman in here with you and she's gonna go along
308.15999999999997,312.56, everywhere you go i mean a lot of people are gonna get annoyed and say oh she's bossy or have to
312.56,317.44, follow her whatnot and so they did explore all those as the commentary explains but ultimately because
317.44,322.24, people reacted in that way you know i just want to let this shut up you know i want to do it i
322.24,326.24, want to do they found some middle ground through iterating worse like she's still as a personality but
326.24,332.0, she's definitely not controlling your experience or anything uh the downside is i think that the more
332.0,337.6, they make her a sympathetic character and the more life they give to her the less alive Gordon seems
337.6,342.08, because Gloria can only his only means of interacting with the world's violence and i'm sure
342.08,346.32, well sure like let me that was a wave i mean it's like the character doctor brain accuses him you know
346.32,349.84, what have you ever made all you've ever done is destroy things and so he's kind of like this
349.84,354.0, autistic weapon because he can't talk to her he can't hug her there's all these times when she's
354.0,358.32, showing all this emotion and you know she you're you're leaving and she's pressed her hat her hand on the
358.4,364.4, glass and it's like it's almost bringing out the crowbar can you now you can't do anything
364.4,369.76, of that so now it's it's it's it's you never listen because she's handled so well it's kind of
369.76,373.84, bringing up these new issues where you're like well what what then you know where that part of the
373.84,378.88, game is a movie you watch and then the the game part is the shit that you're blowing up and the stuff
378.88,383.28, that you're fighting you know maybe this is all this a men and men are from Mars you know you know
383.28,389.35999999999996, she talks she cares and he just kills shit yeah it's times you know like she gets you know
389.35999999999996,392.32, like give too many spoilers away i think i think a lot of people have already played it but there's
392.32,397.67999999999995, times where she definitely could use like a order to your or something just to say like it actually
397.67999999999995,403.67999999999995, acknowledging that you exist that you're here you know um other things about the game is it's really
403.67999999999995,408.4, i mean it if that's done to sort of you know amusement park ride design in the past they've really
408.47999999999996,414.0, done it in this one wow it doesn't have even some of the more open-ended parts in in half
414.0,418.0, life too they were pretty few and far between but there were a few sections where you had some options
418.64,424.08, you can i don't say i'd say i guess maybe in terms of how you're handling antlines there's times
424.08,428.4, okay when you have you know options afforded to you you didn't either use them or not use them in
428.4,433.12, different ways um the cheap the car section somebody but you can just get rid of it you just can
433.12,437.28000000000003, forgo the cheap if you want and the speedrunners actually bunny hop that whole section uh
437.28000000000003,443.84000000000003, so it's uh paradoxically faster than the vehicle but um but but here oh and and you know a few
443.84000000000003,448.4, other things were opened up there's the part in inside uh no a prospect prison where you get the
448.4,452.0, turrets out and you have to set them up a certain way and then oh yeah moving forward because the
452.0,456.4, game is actually moving forward rapidly you stop and you had to figure out how you're going to
456.4,460.88, survive that was counter that was a good level yeah so the two sections in episode one are very
460.96,464.4, much like that and i thought those are the ones everyone's responding to you here people talking
464.4,468.96, about an elevator and that's basically you're waiting for an elevator to come another scenario you've
468.96,473.12, heard before but then all hell breaks loose and a lot of stuff comes at you and you've got to figure
473.12,479.2, out and do it um how to survive it and or something else that's kind of like that toward the end but
479.2,485.36, um it's much it's kind of hard to fault them because it's it's the railroad is so well done and it's
485.36,490.08, so smooth and and in a true suit that you you just have a good time playing it but at the same time
490.15999999999997,493.52, you kind of wonder like let's you know what would it be like if they stop more and let the AI
493.52,498.32, breathe give it a little more room to let the fights go last a little longer yeah and and that
498.32,503.52, respect I think it's where like you may might have I mean another steam game it just came out recently
503.52,508.08, syneposodes well one thing they they they they're strength is they meet it just on a apologetic
508.08,513.12, shooting gallery and that respect that game worked no I wish I almost wish that some of that got
513.12,519.04, poured more into uh episode one but but it those more straight shooter stuff well at least just more
519.12,524.7199999999999, targets to hit more you know something like that as well otherwise the best too oh yeah I really
524.7199999999999,529.92, man that was just a bunch of people just a couple moments at the home trying to play that
529.92,534.3199999999999, what is my fiance is watching at shea glad stuff shea glad stuff sorry so that was a few other
534.3199999999999,539.12, things I really wanted to see in this game that I we had every reason to believe we'll see him in the
539.12,546.4, episode two oh my god I got a coffee shondies every week okay so
546.72,554.72, no new weapons in episode one and very few new creatures and well Valve was really when we
554.72,558.8, last spoke with them for aftermath cover story they were really proud of the fact that when people
558.8,562.9599999999999, came to him asking what's next they weren't asking what are the new weapons or the new levels
562.9599999999999,566.9599999999999, or the new creatures are asking about motivation you know way to your matters like that but at the
566.9599999999999,572.64, same time I think it is the monster manager and the weapons that make calf life series what it is
573.6,578.56, and so without new not too many new entries in it you kind of find yourself wondering why are you
578.56,582.72, guys being stingy throw some more in there and I definitely they're alluding to all that in a second
582.72,587.1999999999999, and the trailer that they show when you complete episode one shows clearly some new things
587.1999999999999,591.92, well technically it was one new weapon I mean well in a sense when you when you were a flare when
591.92,598.4, you capture the mines and I'll reprogram them to hunt the right right so I mean technically that was the
598.4,603.1999999999999, equivalent of the antline exactly but it is not a lot of times his dog in episode one
603.1999999999999,606.8, episode two sorry he's the very first thing you see it's a very first thing actually it's a really
606.8,610.3199999999999, cool it I don't want to blow anything for people having played the game yet it's a very cool opening
610.3199999999999,615.1999999999999, sequence that it revolves around dog hmm so you're not really not any genuine interaction with
615.1999999999999,618.48, them though which is kind of disappointing but yeah well definitely want to see more of them that's
618.48,623.28, for sure so how long did it take you to breathe sir did I ask you that to me but you know
623.28,628.24, felt the recommended six hours or so it was before from here so my play to get on the commentary
628.24,632.48, mode and really enjoyed that commentary mode on it's great to not fluff it all I mean as you're
632.48,638.16, playing real eye opening stuck in a shummoile earlier about how at the best moments you just
638.88,642.56, interacted the world some way and then you hit the commentary panel and it basically just explains
642.56,646.64, you know what you just did and why you know I did do that you know so what it will flash
646.64,650.64, when there's a comment they're floating well they're floating bubbles around the world so
650.64,655.1999999999999, you can activate them whatever you think it's like using anything in the environment well
655.1999999999999,658.8, and it was one of the good things that they took from Los coast and I hope to hopefully do it
658.8,663.04, a lot of other developers pick up and do as well it's really pretty revolutionary I guess what
663.04,668.16, they're doing I mean this is it's kind of a quiet like huge deal but you know I mean this is a
668.16,675.52, major expansion to a huge major game and it was released online right and I think it's going to
676.0799999999999,681.6, I think it's doing really well already and we'll continue to do well and and it ends on such a
681.6,685.04, good note you know how we're talking about how the problem with synapse so does that we have
685.04,688.56, it even you know finished the thing and it's like by the time the next one comes out how
689.12,693.36, the agent his patient is going to be there at this one the moment it ends you want more you're like
693.36,697.04, I can't wait can't have that now and then the problem is then it's like oh god five months
697.04,702.4, such a long time to wait now I want to play this right away and then so I think a few of the
703.36,707.92, addition of the variety ending with the teaser trailer of the next one that's just basic
707.92,713.6, episode stuff so like the end of a lost episode of teaser so they did that right and then the
713.6,717.52, teaser is like they spend the whole episode making you really care about Alex and then the first thing
717.52,721.36, you see in the teaser is that it looks like she's dead or she's dying or something so it's definitely
721.36,726.24, a cliffhanger and they introduce more questions just like we're saying in our previous podcast how they've
726.24,731.1999999999999, got to like keep us keep some things out there they'll develop over time so they just they're
731.2,735.6, nailing it all this counts now the big thing is we got to wait another five months if you
735.6,740.48, really think it'll hit it in five months I think they will just because I suspect that Dave
741.0400000000001,745.6, kind of taking approach a lot like the high profile comics artists will do where they'll they'll
745.6,749.36, wrap they'll do a six issue series and they'll wrap like three of them before they announced the thing
749.36,753.9200000000001, and then they're slow on the last few ones at the pace they work so I think they've got a good
753.9200000000001,757.6800000000001, head start on to you already I mean look at the trailer it's like yeah I sure hope you know
757.68,761.76, I mean look at the commentary reveals too well you'll find a lot I wouldn't be able to much
761.76,765.5999999999999, but a lot of the setup there it's kind of like I was different they're saying it's difficult
765.5999999999999,770.16, because this is already basically done for two when we just had to set it up here and five months is
770.16,774.3199999999999, a long time but I guess when you think about you know so it's five so it's five years like yes
774.3199999999999,779.4399999999999, yeah five years or two years between expansions so were you saying a lot of the same areas
779.4399999999999,784.0799999999999, from the original that was that was the other thing I mean they're they're different I mean environments
784.32,788.4000000000001, but they're similar there's a hospital you know in hospitals there's sort of similar to prisons in a
788.4000000000001,794.08, weird way so it kind of reminded of no-but prospect there's subway sections and and it's just like
794.08,798.64, way to the whole niche so it definitely was you know it's different it wasn't exactly the same but
798.64,802.1600000000001, you're in the same you're in the same environments and whatnot different you know different parts
802.1600000000001,806.64, of the citadel much deeper inside and things like that but you see some kind of similarities like
806.64,809.76, I mean obviously this is said and I wouldn't go back and it's falling apart the second time
809.84,814.16, was opposed to when you're there the first time you know fighting away up to the top but I really
814.16,818.72, really though I agree I mean I wish there were all new environments and and it's so for two it's
818.72,824.08, like we know now that they're moving out and since I'm kind of deep forest likely that some
824.08,828.96, Arctic areas and facilities and stuff and I mean I'm a sucker for that stuff you know you want to
828.96,834.0, you want to feel like you're in a new space and they do their spaces so well oh what do you think
834.0,839.84, Ryan are you gonna play now that you've heard all this no have you still put it too busy playing
839.84,846.4, you'll watch actually I think I was the first among us to play half-life too okay what I played it
846.4,854.48, at some pre-e3 event oh that's ready what a waste pack before it came out that you were supposed to go
854.48,858.72, to so the small game that's higher game oh no I mean I played like through
859.6800000000001,865.2, it was some like driving level yeah so I think when you guys were talking about all that
865.2,868.72, a ryan is just hearing it's like wow wow great go to a long
869.76,873.84, short you played it all after the that he for even had you played it all after that
873.84,878.5600000000001, or was that early that I might have played a little bit of it
878.5600000000001,883.12, good I think that was killing me right I'm willing the most exposure I've had to it though
883.12,888.32, right we've got a bit of a shooter that came out today it's just for you it's a mod for the
888.32,896.72, source engine it's called a trojan the divine playground yeah so it's basically
897.2800000000001,903.2800000000001, toga battles with the slingshots and awesome in spears and there's like bullet time for your
903.2800000000001,908.0, spear and up at the point of the series yeah it's pretty good it's kind of fun playing it because it's
908.0,913.5200000000001, like you can have like there's a ton of bots and they operate with you so it's kind of like a two-player
913.68,919.04, co-op game but the other side is also has a has humans controlling you know they play the
919.04,923.28, god characters and they just basically shuttle between the guys that they're controlling but it is
923.28,928.56, different they gotta play more to give you a salt thumbs up or down but if you don't like the guns
928.56,934.8, right you can you can use a slingshot in this one the whole image missle number five
934.8,938.88, what's not it's not really the gun it's the first person I just don't like the
938.88,943.84, naked nauseous or something I just it's just weird to me playing first first in the
943.84,948.48, engine I can't see the character that I'm playing it's weird like it's like a peripheral vision
948.48,953.68, do you play a blibyan no would you play it if you could just scroll wheel back and see your character
953.68,960.0, possibly so how are you with like a two-meter kind of games or those are cool and have you guys
960.0,964.96, this isn't a PC game but if you guys played unreal championship on the Xbox yeah like I've played
964.96,969.84, bad that's fine it's just for not tournament so being able to scroll the wheel back a little bit
969.84,973.6, you're talking about unreal championship too yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
973.6,980.64, this second one uh speaking guys of anything else say about episode one so we should all get
980.64,985.2, it really I think you should definitely get it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so three episodes
985.2,991.6800000000001, for this I guess this story arc I have this 5-Middle I said 19 and 19 $20 okay on team and
991.68,996.4, really is worth it yeah it's one of those things where when you're done you're not even thinking
996.4,1000.8, about money yeah sure you know I really say that and they break it down in the math you know and
1000.8,1005.12, they were like well if you only played it for five hours and then maybe another three on the commentary
1005.12,1010.4799999999999, mode it's like when you're playing it you just not on your mind you're like this is a good game
1010.4799999999999,1015.28, I'm enjoying playing this and like if I didn't buy this I would have really missed out yeah you know
1015.28,1018.7199999999999, I don't really know that that argument definitely hold it for me and you find a lot of the people
1018.72,1022.88, put a different price point on playing a game as opposed to like watching to our movie
1022.88,1028.72, I was just gonna say how much do DVDs cost $21.000 going to the movies 10 bucks to set
1028.72,1034.16, different to some piece of credit like you guys also X-Men actually actually school to
1034.16,1039.28, have a game on that did anyone send up review on that game yeah with weird is the X-Men
1039.28,1043.92, game and the Da Vinci code game just kind of like snuck into the office is sort of like you know
1043.92,1051.1200000000001, some bad cheese or something that's it no one's picking him up we got today was like extreme duck hunting
1051.1200000000001,1055.92, oh no no no hold on my duck hunting you actually get to select and train your dogs but the
1055.92,1062.0, dog on it looks like it was biting it's lip that was a really bad lip problems the dog
1062.0,1066.16, look like it was biting it's on that yeah it was games yeah we're jawed dog with how they do that
1066.72,1071.1200000000001, no but you look at it you ever have something where you look at it and you feel bad for it so bad
1071.12,1075.1999999999998, that you're almost like yeah it should just buy this to safety staff and it's like people who
1075.1999999999998,1080.32, have to work on it but it's like some hillbilly on the back you know with his dog and
1083.1999999999998,1087.36, it was deer hunter game well probably most of those guys are you know just
1087.36,1091.04, wishing they were working on half-life to it right there's a guy don't know maybe they're really
1091.04,1096.0, into it you could make it you could make it totally good hunting game and there are a few
1096.0,1100.4799999999998, or a cutting mod it's just the when you look at them they're always so home we look at
1100.48,1104.16, in terms of execution get you want to shoot yourself instead of the dog
1106.96,1112.0, not make a good line for a box so pretty used that for guys yeah I'd rather shoot myself
1112.0,1116.72, than play this game but again when we're if you just come up with that we're when the one review
1116.72,1120.88, actually first we should see who reviews it but then we got to like verify that they've got the
1120.88,1127.84, Dick Cheney joke in there too right of course yeah yeah yeah so I'll read we're probably not
1127.84,1132.48, gonna review that or da Vinci code or X-Men well actually I want to okay we're probably not going
1132.48,1137.1999999999998, to it's a really good answer he says no I do have to throw out one thing only because uh
1137.1999999999998,1142.24, my fiance Amy she is a sucker for da Vinci code so she wanted to play the game and
1142.24,1146.24, but it's all about puzzles and she seems to love it so yeah if you like puzzle games
1146.24,1149.12, and you can forgive a little bit like the game
1149.12,1154.8, it's a lot of uh it's a lot of uh it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of
1154.8,1157.6799999999998, it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of people like it so that's not they know
1157.6799999999998,1161.84, all right so Amy says check out the Da Vinci cake exact the rest of us who don't know anything
1161.84,1166.3999999999999, about it say don't bother or if you don't know anything I listen to it an audio book for
1166.3999999999999,1171.84, he did the X-Men one unfortunately we might want to just not we might want to not dismiss it I
1171.84,1176.9599999999998, heard that the Ice Man can shoot ice in the Wolverine applause really does he say it
1177.04,1181.52, wow that's that's fantastic it's a night crawler I can tell a word so awesome I thought
1181.52,1186.16, night crawlers and in the new movie he's not but he's in the game he's got to be having games
1186.16,1191.1200000000001, two maximum blue characters because they had mystique and beast so yeah the whole thing

1279.5200000000002,1286.3200000000002, got us podcasts yeah hold on okay open the window make sure we get the smoke out yeah we have a
1286.32,1291.12, sponsor now kind of weird that's a good thing I guess it's a good thing don't get us or
1291.12,1299.84, so it's in trouble let's move on now I want to make fun of a sponsor yet shopping at the bit won't
1299.84,1306.8799999999999, do it the Gary's mod we didn't well you talked about the Gary's mod going on it's Gary's mod
1306.8799999999999,1312.1599999999999, tennis coming up pretty soon right yeah it's coming out on a steam when we last talked to him for
1312.24,1317.8400000000001, our story and the more magazine for the mod so yeah this is the steam ocean yeah but so much is coming
1317.8400000000001,1323.68, out on there but anyway yet Gary newman of Gary's mod last told us that he had no interest
1323.68,1330.72, of cars fan eight makes his game retail that Gary newman yeah but so anyway he is in fact now making his
1330.72,1336.64, game retail for $5 over over steam that's Jen with valves blessing and you can get all the previous
1336.64,1342.0, versions for free still and it's just if you want number 10 and he's adding a quite a few new
1342.0,1347.44, features to it and so it's can you get the older ones for free still yeah oh you can okay so it's a
1347.44,1352.72, real player and then another quick note on Gary is he's got this new game coming out called face one
1354.64,1359.92, deliciously named but it's because his his two years ago called face punch duty so it's kind of
1359.92,1367.76, you know like crytac crisis type thing and it's it's this wow what he's looking uh two these
1367.76,1373.12, sites will it's like a suit of you know pseudo 3d sites growing shooter game with weird
1373.12,1377.68, floating brains and stuff and all kinds of internet in jokes and memes going on in the background
1377.68,1383.12, and it just looks completely chaotic and it no offense to to Gary but what was your reaction
1383.12,1390.56, when you watch the movie Darren uh Jesus it's just like Gary is for it's hard like I think
1390.56,1394.72, I think I'm in a good way he was like yeah I think he taught it in a good way yeah as in let's get
1394.72,1400.24, retarded in here oh yeah so you're watching it so we've started to crap on the screen it's like
1400.24,1404.64, don't send us angry letters we mean it in the black eyed piece way right we're very straight
1404.64,1408.8, and yeah it's like if you took the something on before and send me a game out of it so
1409.92,1415.44, what did they mean anyway let's get retarded in here what did that we can we can we can
1415.44,1420.08, dissect the lyrics for next time but be stupid so I would that meant like they may instead of saying
1420.1599999999999,1426.8, girl we couldn't get much hard to say girl things couldn't get much better okay didn't that get
1426.8,1438.8799999999999, changed so let's get started yeah yeah yeah I hate the man okay so other than steam do we have
1438.8799999999999,1443.12, anything to talk about this month you're still playing out of the legends right just like
1443.12,1448.08, I think I'm going to do it and it's still good it's all up now yeah it has yet to piss me off which
1448.08,1453.1999999999998, is pretty good for an RTS yeah are you still blowing through the single player campaign going
1453.1999999999998,1458.08, yeah just about at the end of the second of the three legs okay so you're in the outland you're in
1458.08,1462.2399999999998, the alem campaign right yeah right at the end of that one about this start the quadril over you
1462.2399999999998,1466.08, pronounce that how is that though I mean like I've only had a chance to play through the bench
1466.08,1470.32, he part so far so it's just very steam punky I mean does it the game change it's feel as you're
1470.8,1474.8799999999999, yeah it was a little nervous when I started the alem campaign because you still have the same
1474.8799999999999,1478.56, units right at the beginning so I'm like I thought I was going to play as some other group but then
1479.28,1483.84, plot stuff happens and you're suddenly playing as the other group so you do get it is a pretty distinct
1483.84,1488.32, and a pretty different to aren't they yeah they're very like kind of a raving and theme and
1488.32,1492.56, had lots of desert things and they're more magicy so it doesn't have a different feel kind of like
1492.56,1496.1599999999999, how when you play the starcraft for that first time through the campaign there's no good yeah you know
1496.1599999999999,1499.6, the human's ergon that's not bad yeah I was hoping they would do that and they kind of did I
1499.9199999999998,1505.4399999999998, they're not so different at this point that it's like mind-blowing but because like I think the
1505.4399999999998,1510.0, zerg were like way different than the terrens so I think it's more of like a protoss terren kind of
1510.0,1515.6799999999998, compa okay okay but maybe the third I haven't even seen this third fact can yet so they could
1515.6799999999998,1522.3999999999999, be completely crazy every game should just add zerg links all about the zerg rush yeah what about
1522.3999999999999,1528.1599999999999, hitman anyone playing that just started as very basic now but I mean I like the idea behind it
1528.5600000000002,1532.96, I only did it I only had time for the tutorial mission this weekend just it's a good start I
1532.96,1537.44, will be able to report back next week all right I'm still protesting those ads
1539.6000000000001,1545.28, and like they're just too gross I don't want to play that game sorry the thing I want to know
1545.28,1550.0800000000002, about this hitman is the problem I had with the previous ones is uh you know there's supposed to be
1550.0800000000002,1554.8000000000002, all these open ended options and all these you know married ways that you can can take out your
1554.8799999999999,1560.32, mark but sometimes it's really they're only a few and they're very carefully planning it's
1560.32,1564.6399999999999, a matter of you figuring out what they are it's sometimes they're counter intuitive and it's punishing
1564.6399999999999,1567.76, you for like not getting them and that's been the frustrating part for me to do you know I
1567.76,1573.12, exactly like puzzle oriented and a way or right right I mean well that they they addressed that I
1573.12,1576.3999999999999, mean I asked them I early on in the pre-imbing they were previewing the game we first time around
1576.3999999999999,1580.6399999999999, and there they said that that's a big part of is leaving many different ways for you to set up the
1581.5200000000002,1585.5200000000002, ideas to make it look like an accident right if you can make it look like an accident and yeah it's a
1585.5200000000002,1590.72, little bit of puzzle solving in that respect but it's not like the uh get the cat hair and the
1590.72,1595.2800000000002, snow head then the syrup to make me up the most at but it wasn't always like that back it's the
1595.2800000000002,1598.96, difference between say a GTA mission where you're supposed to take out some guy when he leaves a movie
1598.96,1603.76, theater and then it really is literally up to you what you want to do if you want to block and then
1603.76,1607.68, by parking a million cars and there that you're not going to blow off by the fire through a
1607.76,1612.5600000000002, all-time cocktail into him if you want to snipe whatever whereas in his hand there might be like
1612.5600000000002,1616.96, to get in to satisfy the conditions where you can get close enough to this guy or whatever you've
1616.96,1621.92, got to do a few things like you've got to find one very specific costume but to get that costume you
1621.92,1626.3200000000002, got to like kill him in a very specific way or find over the very specific moment right and so it's
1626.3200000000002,1631.92, finding all those rules that it's like you know FAQ territory and yeah I mean like I said I haven't
1631.92,1635.76, gotten too deep into it but I do like I do like the fact that they're saying they're going to leave
1635.84,1641.92, it open ended and they're saying that too well I like them saying and I hope they're actually doing it
1642.48,1646.72, but this one you also kind of cool and incentivizing is that you actually want to go through each of
1646.72,1652.0, these missions without being seen because actually a newspaper reports are getting generated
1652.0,1658.8799999999999, depending on how you perform any commission so if you leave witnesses or access suspicious around
1658.8799999999999,1663.44, people they'll actually be like at the end of each mission there's like a fake newspaper and like
1663.52,1666.0, they can be a police artist catch of you so that the next one loading screen
1667.04,1671.28, pretty much but in the next episode and the next mission rather they'll be looking for you
1671.28,1674.3200000000002, from the get go so it makes it like it scales up a difficulty
1675.2,1678.88, but that could be the bad thing imagine if you keep getting noticed by the fifth mission you've
1678.88,1683.04, got half the world looking for you so then you got to reload mission well so then it turns into a
1683.04,1687.8400000000001, shooting game as a part of it is a part of it is to a stealth game uh tool I guess that's I guess a lot
1687.8400000000001,1692.0, of those games are kind of like that yeah I mean like I mean it's a little bit different one here
1692.08,1696.88, back for you next week because it's like I've close to this close to getting that game and playing it
1697.52,1701.68, I just need a little more convincing yeah I mean like I like I said I haven't gotten too deep in but
1701.68,1708.8, potential so and yet again we're very game-head of this week oh that's really but I also saw
1708.8,1713.2, some of the podcast that's true yeah that's true we do what we work we draw that talk about
1713.2,1717.76, desperate house works we can talk I've never seen that show ever good for you do you know what I
1717.76,1723.6, did this week and I tended to wedding in World Warcraft oh wow we were the best man
1723.6,1728.32, actually wasn't invited but my daughter was it was it was for her so you you just he was
1728.32,1733.44, a right three loaded yeah I went on the same terms I was sort of like hanging around the
1733.44,1738.4, outskirts there now you feel but at that moment it's like describe your feeling pretty stupid
1740.4,1746.24, is it was she was making cookies and stuff for your talk no that's for uh this coming uh holiday season
1746.24,1750.48, that's not till like Halloween and Christmas that they're making no they have a big sale or they
1750.48,1754.96, actually uh not they're given away the cookies all these over the spirit of the season all this is an
1754.96,1760.96, angle what what a couple of other players be closed and just riding through all there was nothing
1760.96,1767.44, preventing them no the wedding was in uh we're not darnasses I guess it is and uh there was a level
1767.44,1774.64, 16 night off priest who was performing ceremony and those are dwarf male character and a female
1775.44,1780.3200000000002, human I think and he's too to I know that she's interbreeding she's only after her first
1780.3200000000002,1786.96, man I was really against it yeah personally um and so they had the ceremony they had bride
1786.96,1790.88, grooms and brides made the line up and they were all kneeling you know they had the kneel
1790.88,1795.3600000000001, they were like roleplaying in the dialogue too kind of yeah the priest was speaking and like you know
