0.0,7.84, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. This is the podcast for March 19th 2008. We'll

10.52,12.52, You sound frantic there. Really?
12.52,14.36, Hello and welcome like her.
14.36,16.32, I was trying to send a little more professional than
16.32,19.64, no. Well we just got so much to talk about.
19.64,22.8, We got some of I got that fast so we get it all in.
22.8,28.880000000000003, Jeff Grener and Chief of GFW and I'm here with the usual cast.
28.880000000000003,31.8, Plus one of our regular new regulars.
31.8,33.8, I trust your sales.
33.8,35.8," Hey, Ryan Scott."
35.8,37.8, Anthony Gagos.
37.8,38.8, Hey.
38.8,40.8, Hey.
40.8,41.8, Hey.
41.8,48.68, So I guess last week I started to say that Blizzard had said something about us introducing ourselves
48.68,49.68, and then I never told.
49.68,51.0, Never fully explain what that meant.
51.0,55.84," So I'll do it now just in case, which was it wasn't Blizzard said do this and we listened"
55.84,57.6, to what Blizzard says.
57.6,63.56, It was that one guy who works at Blizzard came up and offered me the advice because we had
63.56,65.96000000000001, talked about it here on the podcast.
65.96000000000001,69.84, We had talked about whether we need to keep doing that every week and he said yes you do
69.84,77.32, because because you know we need to put a voice with the name and every sometime every week
77.32,79.16, it's going to be somebody's first time.
79.16,82.75999999999999, Was it by any chance one of the lead designers for World Warcraft?
82.75999999999999,83.75999999999999," No, it was not."
83.75999999999999,89.47999999999999," Okay, because I was going to say I talked to I missed this name but at the one up probably"
89.47999999999999,90.47999999999999, in the story ceremony.
90.47999999999999,96.19999999999999," Yeah, go to one of the very are fellows kind words for our magazine."
96.19999999999999,97.19999999999999, Really?
97.19999999999999,98.19999999999999, Yeah.
98.19999999999999,99.19999999999999, Wow.
99.19999999999999,101.6, We need to repeat them but sure you do.
101.6,106.72, If it was him I'll say I'll take his word for what to introduce ourselves.
106.72,107.72, I think it's a fine.
107.76,108.72, Yeah.
108.72,109.72, To introduce ourselves.
109.72,110.72, Sure.
110.72,112.72, And that's done.
112.72,113.72, Okay.
113.72,114.72, Now we did that.
114.72,115.72, Do you have anything else this week?
115.72,116.72, Yeah.
116.72,119.72, I've been really busy all day so I haven't even seen you guys.
119.72,124.72, I've beholded up in my office writing your employee evaluations.
124.72,129.16, I decided that today's podcast will be the final determination.
129.16,130.16, Does this work?
130.16,134.72," Does this work like college though, where we get to do an evaluation of you as well?"
134.72,135.72," Well, you get to."
136.72,137.72," Oh, that would suck."
137.72,141.72, I should have fucking opened up.
141.72,147.56," No, I think shoe evaluates to me but like we sit like I write this thing and then HR proves"
147.56,152.32," it and then well they look at it and then they'll go, you can't you can't do this Jeff."
152.32,154.32, These are two like nice.
154.32,155.32, They're too central.
155.32,156.32, Yeah.
156.32,158.32, This is a harassment.
158.32,163.28," No, they'll say you got to put in something negative here because otherwise it looks like"
163.28,165.68, you like you didn't really you know try really.
165.68,166.68, That's how it just true.
166.68,167.68," Yeah, I get it."
167.68,171.96," And yeah, because then it has to look like you were balanced you know that you weren't"
171.96,172.96, just being you know nice.
172.96,175.96, I've got to come up with some random things.
175.96,176.96, You basically have to write it.
176.96,177.96, They're playing games at you.
177.96,178.96," Yeah, yes."
178.96,180.6, It is people you work with.
180.6,181.6, It is.
181.6,182.60000000000002, Pros.
182.60000000000002,183.60000000000002, Right.
183.60000000000002,185.0," Well, hopefully HR doesn't listen to this podcast."
185.0,186.60000000000002, Ryan's graphics are polished.
186.60000000000002,187.60000000000002, His control.
187.60000000000002,189.56, I get a new sub the installation.
189.56,193.84," So yeah, so then I'll do that and then you'll come to my office and I'll like"
193.84,197.12, hand you the thing and you're going to lick it and there's you know it's like calm
197.12,198.92000000000002, from one to five.
198.92000000000002,200.76, But it's kind of like the second to nine scale.
200.76,201.76," You know, it sounds larger."
201.76,202.76, Yeah.
202.76,205.96, But then there's going to be like one or two things that are like in the two or three
205.96,208.92000000000002, calming you're going to be looking at it going what the fuck.
208.92000000000002,214.0, Why does Jeff say that I you know whatever it is and I'll say I had to put that in there
214.0,215.76, because they said I did.
215.76,216.76, So there it is.
216.76,218.16, Now we don't actually have to have the value.
218.16,219.16, So this is the evaluation.
219.16,220.16, This is it.
220.16,221.16, You guys are great.
221.4,222.16, I had a past job.
222.16,227.48, I had they switched my supervisor like the day before they were doing evaluations.
227.48,229.48, So the guy I had never worked with in my entire life.
229.48,233.51999999999998, I had worked with for like a day did my evaluation two days later and I was like what
233.51999999999998,234.51999999999998, does the point of this?
234.51999999999998,235.51999999999998, Wow.
235.51999999999998,236.51999999999998, And he did it completely sincerely.
236.51999999999998,238.51999999999998, It was just a really just a little bit.
238.51999999999998,239.51999999999998, He was a nice guy.
239.51999999999998,240.51999999999998, He gave you a good one.
240.51999999999998,241.51999999999998, Yeah.
241.51999999999998,242.51999999999998, Mixed bag.
242.51999999999998,243.51999999999998, Really?
243.51999999999998,244.51999999999998, Wow.
244.51999999999998,248.72, That's a very recent problem.
249.04,254.48, I we should get a letter grades on these two since one up chains across the board.
254.48,258.2, I should I should email Simon and suggest and then we can haggle with you.
258.2,258.6, Sean L.
258.6,259.6, Get to B minus.
259.6,260.96," Well, I so low."
260.96,263.24, So that's so played out.
263.24,265.32, But it's like it's out of low man.
265.32,266.32, It's evergreen.
266.32,267.32, It works for.
267.32,268.32, Right.
268.32,269.96, It was it's played out but now it's coming back.
269.96,270.96, It's so out.
270.96,272.96, Now we can use it ironically.
272.96,278.64, You know what we had some guy send a reader mail the other day complaining about the
278.64,283.88, switch to letter grades because he said and he said this like he's all he's all I'm
283.88,290.44, Asian and I get all a's or anything below an A looks like it sucks and I hate it.
290.44,292.24, You're all just all like feeling comfortable.
292.24,293.56, He was clearly joking.
293.56,296.03999999999996, He was having fun at the expense of stereotypes Jeff.
296.03999999999996,297.03999999999996, It's okay to laugh.
297.03999999999996,298.03999999999996," Oh, that goes."
298.03999999999996,299.03999999999996, That would is.
299.03999999999996,300.03999999999996, Okay.
300.03999999999996,301.03999999999996, Yes.
301.03999999999996,302.03999999999996," So, so."
302.03999999999996,303.03999999999996, Great.
303.03999999999996,304.03999999999996, Crazy.
304.03999999999996,305.03999999999996," Oh, I am."
305.03999999999996,306.03999999999996, We've had a couple in the right.
306.03999999999996,308.52, This is just what what the guy said in his email.
308.52,309.52, Okay.
309.52,310.91999999999996, Crazy over a cheavers not fans of.
310.91999999999996,312.52, That's about later.
312.52,313.52," Well, okay."
313.52,314.52, Fine.
314.52,316.52, So B might as well be an F.
316.52,319.12," Well, he would feel that way with a 95 or something."
319.12,320.12, Yeah.
320.12,322.52," Well, the other wrong."
322.52,325.12, The top topic of letter grades and under achievement.
325.12,326.12, Yeah.
326.12,327.91999999999996, Maybe we could bring up a turning point.
327.91999999999996,328.91999999999996," Oh, they're watching."
328.91999999999996,329.91999999999996, You are.
329.91999999999996,331.71999999999997, Janking point the fall of right.
331.71999999999997,334.52, Because it's turning point the fall liberty.
334.52,335.52, Yeah.
335.52,337.52, It's who made this game?
338.52,339.52, Spark unlimited.
339.52,340.52, Okay.
340.52,343.32, It code master's published.
343.32,344.32, And you reviewed it.
344.32,345.32, I'm on with a silence.
345.32,346.32, I didn't review it.
346.32,347.32," No, we touched it."
347.32,348.91999999999996," Oh, Rory, we're all reviewed it."
348.91999999999996,349.91999999999996, I don't know for this.
349.91999999999996,352.52, I guess if the reviews should be going up online soon.
352.52,353.52, Is it?
353.52,354.52, Or maybe not.
354.52,355.52, Sure.
355.52,356.52, He didn't like it.
356.52,357.52, That's not getting a good score.
357.52,361.52, And I went and played through the entire thing as well.
361.52,362.52, And yeah.
362.52,366.71999999999997, I didn't think very much of it either.
366.72,370.20000000000005," The thing with this game that makes it interesting, though, is that the developers,"
370.20000000000005,375.84000000000003," the CEO of Spark and Limited Craig Allen, has been online with videogamework.com, defending"
375.84000000000003,376.84000000000003, the game.
376.84000000000003,377.84000000000003, Which is totally fair.
377.84000000000003,378.84000000000003, I understand that.
378.84000000000003,379.84000000000003, But it's kind of odd.
379.84000000000003,383.52000000000004, I wanted to like compare some of his statements with what I got out of the game.
383.52000000000004,390.64000000000004," So to a gamer video gamer.com, he says, you know, I think that when you try to do games"
390.64000000000004,396.04, that are about a mass market and turning point is definitely a high concept idea that
396.04,399.52000000000004," with the time and money we had, we did the best to execute on our target was not really"
399.52000000000004,401.20000000000005, the core gamer.
401.20000000000005,403.96000000000004," So I mean, that's pretty confusing right there."
403.96000000000004,404.96000000000004, I don't understand.
404.96000000000004,409.28000000000003, He's going back and forth between it is supposed to be a mass market game.
409.28000000000003,412.08000000000004, And yet it's a high concept.
412.08000000000004,413.8, But then our target wasn't the core gamer.
413.8,417.48," So core is that like the hardcore gamer, core hardcore."
417.48,419.8, And the mass market is the Walmart.
419.8,424.96000000000004," And I think of core when that makes me think of like the main, his main constituency."
424.96000000000004,425.96000000000004," You know, right."
425.96,429.15999999999997, This is the body of my business so then that's where I confused.
429.15999999999997,430.71999999999997, Is there core the people who shot like.
430.71999999999997,433.15999999999997, So he's actually saying we made a Walmart game.
433.15999999999997,437.32," So, but it's really high concept, which he reiterates when he says turning point, the idea"
437.32,439.32, there was really a high concept idea.
439.32,443.0," I think we're finding that the people who look at it like, is this going to be fun?"
443.0,446.0, Something I could drop into in a world I haven't seen before and have a good time.
446.0,447.47999999999996, Really love the game.
447.47999999999996,451.32, People that are looking at what the more critical eye of is this game revolutionary.
451.32,453.71999999999997, Is it doing play mechanics I've never seen before?
453.71999999999997,454.71999999999997, Is it driving?
454.96000000000004,456.64000000000004, Is it driving new technology?
456.64000000000004,458.48," Well, it was never meant to do those things."
458.48,462.16," If people look at it for the right way, I think they really enjoy what they see."
462.16,464.40000000000003, You can certainly look at it and say it's not revolutionary.
464.40000000000003,467.04, So those opinions are certainly a lot more critical.
467.04,468.0," Now, I don't know."
468.0,475.44000000000005," He might be responding to a specific review that I'm not aware of and maybe they, I don't know."
475.44000000000005,480.8, Maybe they were reactionary to it and saying that it was supposed to be a revolution.
480.8,484.08000000000004, It was supposed to be what Half Life One was when it came out.
484.15999999999997,484.64, But I don't know.
484.64,488.08, That's not the impression I got in the number of reviews I did scan.
488.08,492.47999999999996, I saw everyone was more or less on the same page in coming on the fact that the game is a
492.47999999999996,496.08, Janky mess that should not have been released.
496.08,496.88, And he does say that.
496.88,500.24," I mean, given their budget and given the time they had totally understandable, right?"
500.24,503.52, So I don't want this to be too snide.
503.52,509.68, But same time from the consumers point of view and I'm assuming the mass market consumer as well.
509.68,512.0, The thing is a fucking mess.
512.08,514.48," So especially if you get in on PC, this is what you're treated to."
514.48,519.68, And you start the game after you get through all the loading screens and all the splash screens.
520.24,523.76," Instead of being able to use your mouse to select the options or anything like this,"
523.76,527.44, you have to use your arrow keys under keyboard and then the Enter key to pick one.
527.44,530.8," So the message already is, oh yeah."
530.8,532.56, Someone wanted this on PC too.
532.56,532.96, We've seen.
532.96,534.56," Earl, can you get this thing on PC?"
535.12,536.48," Yeah, you got to four."
536.48,537.12, Right.
537.12,539.52," I mean, we've seen this before with PC games, right?"
539.52,540.32, This half horse.
540.32,540.8, Yeah.
540.8,541.6, Yeah.
541.6800000000001,543.6800000000001, But should we clarify that this isn't fact.
543.6800000000001,545.0400000000001, It games for Windows games.
545.0400000000001,548.08, It is in the games for Windows branded package.
548.08,552.16," Oh, so that's a whole another story because what exactly does that mean?"
552.16,554.16," Well, does that to use games for Windows?"
554.16,555.44, Don't really use our minds.
556.48,557.2, Right.
557.76,563.6800000000001," So then when you start to play the game, it uses Unreal Engine 3 and while epic is obviously very"
563.6800000000001,567.28," familiar with their engine and knows how to make, you know, put it to phenomenal use."
567.92,572.88," I'm seeing more and more other studios aren't, you know, they don't have that same,"
572.88,578.9599999999999," you know, intimate understanding of how to work with the engine and to sort of circumvent its"
578.9599999999999,579.9599999999999, limitations.
579.9599999999999,583.12," And one of those is that, well, isn't that what Dennis Dyak was suing them for?"
583.12,587.68," Basically, that product lack of support for the stuff that Epic seems to be able to do with it."
587.68,588.68, Right.
588.68,589.68, That could very well be the case.
589.68,590.68, I don't know.
590.68,592.0799999999999," I mean, I, I, I think that was just a little bit."
592.0799999999999,593.68, Shouldn't comment on that because I really don't know.
593.68,595.28, That was the gist of the description.
595.28,598.8, But I've seen all I can to test to is that now I've been played at several games that
598.8,599.8, use the engine.
599.8,602.3199999999999, It's clear that many studios are having a hard time with it.
602.3199999999999,603.3199999999999," But then again, I don't know."
603.3199999999999,604.3199999999999, Is it Epic's fault?
604.3199999999999,607.9599999999999, Is it their duty to make sure everyone makes a great game with their engine?
607.9599999999999,611.12," You know, I mean, I don't, I have no idea how that falls out."
611.12,613.04, It'll be interesting to see where that goes.
613.04,618.28," But so one thing about the game is that it dynamically streams in, you know, the data"
618.28,619.28, as you're playing.
619.28,623.92," So what, on the positive side, it means unlike Half Life 2, where people complain about these"
623.92,627.92," load periods, you go through an X amount of game and all of a sudden, you can't open"
627.92,629.92, a door and it says loading and you have to wait.
629.92,630.92, People really didn't like that.
630.92,634.4," This is ridiculous because you didn't have to wait for the song, especially compared"
634.4,635.4, to most of the game.
635.4,636.64, With low RAM you did.
636.64,638.4, That was a fair criticism of the app.
638.4,639.4," If you did, okay, well, it did."
639.4,640.4, It didn't always have enough RAM.
640.4,641.4, Enough RAM.
641.4,642.8," Yeah, you could sit there for a while."
642.8,646.88," I mean, of course, we're not talking about anymore than, you know, five minutes max,"
646.88,649.88, but that's a long time when you are mentally capable of it.
649.88,651.28, That's a very long time.
651.28,656.04," So anyway, this, you know, this engine streams it in dynamically, but what happens then is that"
656.04,659.9599999999999, you're going to have some chugging and slow down as it's processing all this.
659.9599999999999,665.3199999999999, So like epic what I assume they do is this is when they choose to make it a downturn
665.3199999999999,668.52," in gameplay where you're talking on, you're getting a transmission and you have to watch"
668.52,671.1999999999999, slowly or they throw a cutscene or something.
671.1999999999999,674.4, It's not when they kick off like the mother of all battles.
674.4,678.72," I don't know why I'm using this song, I'm saying term, but when they kick off some big"
678.72,683.28," conflict and in this game, what happens is every time you open a door, the door opens"
683.28,689.6800000000001, and you got three grenades flying at you and a bunch of just like almost 100% accurate
689.6800000000001,695.64," enemy fire coming your way and then the game's like, and then by the time it resolves"
695.64,698.64," itself, this shit's already blown up in your face and you've died and it's killed"
698.64,700.32, you and it's happening the whole time.
700.32,704.08," So as you're playing, people come by and you're like, dude, can you compete or handle"
704.08,707.44," that and it's like, well, yeah, it can't just watch way to second as the texture's"
707.44,711.5200000000001," coming in and all this other stuff happens and then we find, so that's another technical"
711.5200000000001,712.5200000000001, thing.
712.5200000000001,718.7600000000001," Other technical issues, it's really inexcusable is that it's a game with doors that you can"
718.7600000000001,723.6400000000001," open and elevators that you can use, but you don't open all doors, some are just locked"
723.6400000000001,727.8800000000001, and you don't go in all elevators or a few that are there and you know that that's
727.8800000000001,731.1600000000001, able to interact with them because a little icon of a hand will appear on the screen
731.1600000000001,733.32, as you mouse over it and that solves it.
733.32,736.72, So that tells you don't stand at this door for 10 minutes trying to figure out how to
736.72,739.88," open it because it's not going to open, move on to somewhere else until you find it"
739.88,740.88, door.
740.88,746.6800000000001, But what happens though is that it's coded in some weird way that there might be an elevator
746.6800000000001,754.0," switch or a door that you legitimately can interact with, but it's you won't get the icon"
754.0,755.9200000000001, unless you hit the precise pixel.
755.9200000000001,758.96," So it's like old school of ventricames, you know, the pixel hunting and shit, you have to"
758.96,762.8800000000001, do that and then it's off by the equivalent of yards in the game.
762.88,767.08, So like there's an elevator switch and Anthony here's a witness so I called her to see
767.08,768.6, this kind of stuff.
768.6,772.92," And it's actually maybe like two or three feet, you know, like a full yard over to the"
772.92,777.16, right of the elevator thing and up a little bit and you have to do this very very like
777.16,780.24, precise mouse movements and it's search round and then you get it.
780.24,783.52," And then when you do it, you're basically pushing this brand apart on the wall."
783.52,787.24," Well, well away from the elevator, but what is it like on your monitor would be like"
787.24,788.24, inches away.
788.24,790.16," Yes, it's just a way very very much."
790.16,793.88," So hey, it sounds like a nitpick, but it's not because when you're going through the"
793.88,796.9599999999999," level, you're like, okay, I need to get to the next area."
796.9599999999999,800.1999999999999," But then you've run to an elevator and you say, well, this is knit."
800.1999999999999,801.1999999999999, It's not working.
801.1999999999999,802.1999999999999, There's nothing.
802.1999999999999,803.1999999999999, You don't interact with this.
803.1999999999999,804.1999999999999, You go back through the level.
804.1999999999999,806.88," And then when you've exhausted all other possibilities, then you say, it's got to be that"
806.88,807.88, elevator.
807.88,809.8399999999999, I'm going to go on a pixel hunting there and then you find it and it works.
809.8399999999999,813.12," It happens that way with, you know, ledges and ladders."
813.12,814.12, There's like a ladder.
814.12,815.12, This was the saddest thing.
815.12,819.88," I'm standing right in front of a ladder and there's just like some one tiny, tiny point"
819.88,821.72, where I could bring up the climb ladder icon.
821.72,825.28," And I sat there, you know, probably like a full minute, just like,"
825.28,828.28, creeping around until I could find it.
828.28,829.88, He got way more patience than me.
829.88,831.88," Yeah, that's what that shit's annoying."
831.88,834.52, Is it always consistently off?
834.52,836.88, Is it like three inches like to the right?
836.88,839.0," No, because there were some he would hit that on."
839.0,841.32," Yeah, it was, it was very inconsistent."
841.32,843.32, And that's what that's what makes it a real problem.
843.32,846.36," So it wasn't like you could just go through the game and say, okay, everything's off"
846.36,847.56, by three inches to the right.
847.56,850.92," Yeah, like as if you're compensating for like a poorly cited gun or something."
850.92,851.92, Yeah.
851.92,853.8," And you just, right, sort of are able to deal with it."
853.8,854.8, But it's not that.
854.8,855.8, No.
855.8,862.04," So to go back, no, the high concept thing, the high concept is basically revisionist history"
862.04,865.2399999999999, where the Nazis don't lose World War II.
865.2399999999999,869.8, And Winston Churchill dies in the taxi accident in America that he actually survived
869.8,870.8, in real life.
870.8,874.92," And for whatever reason, that'll know, I guess that it's, you know, Chamberlain stays in power"
874.92,880.28," and Hitler decides to abide by the, the Molentop Act."
880.28,886.1999999999999," And eventually they come to America and they, you know, they invade, you know, in New York."
886.1999999999999,891.9599999999999," So I don't know, high concept is funny because, I mean, that's just a staple of like,"
891.9599999999999,893.16," what, what if he won?"
893.16,897.1999999999999," I mean, that's like a staple of any kind of, I mean, that's equivalent of like, there's a dragon"
897.1999999999999,899.36, in this dungeon and he's got his chest to go over.
899.36,900.5999999999999," I don't know, like junior high."
900.5999999999999,902.8," Yeah, like the white concept."
902.8,903.8, Yeah.
904.1999999999999,907.88," When the game played like worse than Call of Duty 2, like from what I saw."
907.88,912.3599999999999," And it, well, and the quality of the, one is like the lowest possible hanging fruit."
912.3599999999999,913.3599999999999, Isn't it?
913.3599999999999,914.3599999999999, Yeah.
914.3599999999999,915.3599999999999, Any game concept?
915.3599999999999,916.9599999999999, So who's missing that high concept?
916.9599999999999,918.92," That, that, I didn't understand."
918.92,924.3199999999999," What's interesting is what they do with it is it begins, the game, certain sections of the"
924.3199999999999,929.5999999999999," game are, are highly indebted to Half Life 2 to the point where they, they're copying"
929.5999999999999,932.1999999999999," it, note for note, but not getting it right."
932.2,937.36," So like in Half Life 2, one of the cool things is that the Citadel is one of the first"
937.36,938.5200000000001, things you see in the game.
938.5200000000001,940.24, And it's also where the story ends.
940.24,941.5200000000001, It's where you ultimately get to.
941.5200000000001,944.9200000000001," In this game, they follow that same logic where there's this giant zeppelin."
944.9200000000001,947.08, It's equivalent of like the Nazi Death Star.
947.08,948.1600000000001, And that's attacking New York.
948.1600000000001,951.76," And of course, that's where you ultimately, it's always in the sky and you ultimately"
951.76,954.44, get up there.
954.44,956.44," And then it's got some weird stuff, though."
956.44,961.44," It's like it's drawing, it's kind of like playing on the motions of 9-11 by having, you"
961.44,965.12," know, when the Nazis are attacking New York, just big wall of smoke, well, you know, building"
965.12,968.1600000000001," will collapse or something in big wall, smoke will run down the streets and the people"
968.1600000000001,969.1600000000001, will be consumed by it.
969.1600000000001,972.1600000000001," And very, very clearly, just, you know, taking from that."
972.1600000000001,977.0400000000001, And then other stuff that's kind of funny like HE1-11 bombers doing precision attacks
977.0400000000001,980.36," on the statue of Liberty, because she's like, insufficiently fascist or whatever."
980.36,984.44," Or the fact that like, they're, they're new in weapons that they invented were just"
984.44,988.8000000000001, like taking actual word or two inventions and then like adding a different number to it.
988.8,991.64," So instead of an MP40, it was like an MP42."
991.64,992.64, MP50.
992.64,993.64, Yeah.
993.64,994.64, Whatever.
994.64,998.64, And it's improvement was that it's got a flashlight attached to the bottom of it.
998.64,1001.4799999999999, And it shoots three inches to the right of where you're going.
1001.4799999999999,1002.4799999999999, Yeah.
1002.4799999999999,1006.1999999999999," I mean, all the stuff, all the tech in that's a way, like if there's a rocket, it's got three"
1006.1999999999999,1007.1999999999999, barrels on it.
1007.1999999999999,1009.24," If there's a tank, it's got two turrets on it."
1009.24,1010.24, Whoa.
1010.24,1011.24, You know.
1011.24,1014.92," And, but so is you're playing what I mean by like, borrowing from Half-Life is, you"
1014.92,1020.0," know, you have this whole like oppressive, you know, power controlling this urban environment."
1020.0,1024.3999999999999, And then you have a resistance group of people there and you have like little glimpses
1024.3999999999999,1027.24, into like the daily life of the occupied people.
1027.24,1029.08, And it basically wants to do that.
1029.08,1030.44," You know, where you're looking out windows."
1030.44,1032.04," I mean, it was like, nope for an old rip off."
1032.04,1035.84," There's a part and half like two where you're, you know, you're running through sort of"
1035.84,1039.6399999999999," the 10 minute and you look out the window and then a truck pulls up and then they're,"
1039.6399999999999,1042.56," you know, they're dealing with the citizens and stuff and there are other people in"
1042.56,1044.32," the room with you and you're like, oh, god, what happens?"
1044.32,1048.3999999999999," It's basically that, but like it's a good stop-up truck or something that pulls up."
1048.3999999999999,1051.4399999999998, Within like the difference here would be the execution.
1051.4399999999998,1057.08," So imagine if in Half-Life when you have AI allies and they weren't perfect, you know,"
1057.08,1058.76, they would get in your way now and then.
1058.76,1061.8799999999999, But imagine if they're entirely oblivious to your very existence.
1061.8799999999999,1065.48," So if you were lined up at a window and you're trying to shoot someone out the window,"
1065.48,1068.32, then the AI would just be scripted to go to that window.
1068.32,1070.28, It would just come and push you out of the way.
1070.28,1072.48," Like you just get moved, moved out of the way."
1072.48,1075.92," As you're sitting there lining up a shot, you're like, dude, I just about to pull the"
1075.92,1076.92, trigger.
1076.92,1077.92, I got to see it.
1077.92,1078.92, And then it moves you.
1078.92,1083.08," And then to extend, it's so dumb that I got this point when the guys were running through"
1083.08,1084.08, the level.
1084.08,1088.92," So I just stood in front of one of my NPC allies and let him, he just pushed me through half"
1088.92,1091.76," the level as he is running, screaming for me to follow him."
1091.76,1095.24," I'm just standing there as he's like pushing, pulling those in me through the level."
1095.24,1097.2, What if happened if he pushed the other way?
1097.2,1099.48," Dude, it's got a script to follow."
1099.48,1105.32, It's not like what's the comic version of this when the the juggernaut done stopable force
1105.32,1108.84," meets the blob, the immovable object."
1108.84,1110.24, And this world the guy just wins.
1110.24,1114.08," The NPC doesn't make up your finger on the WK, he would just kept going."
1114.08,1115.08, He just kept going.
1115.08,1118.52," Yeah, you have to sort of like strafe to the side to get out of the way."
1118.52,1119.52, But it's like that.
1119.52,1125.24," And the sad thing is that it's just not even, I mean, most shooters, it's kind of"
1125.24,1126.24," safe territory, right?"
1126.24,1128.68, Because you can only fuck up a shooter so much.
1128.68,1131.56," And if you get the shooting right, they can still be enjoyable."
1131.56,1133.2," You're like, it's just fun."
1133.2,1137.24, For a lot of people just pointing at something and shooting is kind of fun in a game.
1137.24,1138.88, But like this doesn't even get that right.
1138.88,1144.56," The guy's die, there's this very, very noticeable transition from them being animated to"
1144.56,1148.68," like an instant rag doll, but not with like the speed or anything of like the way that"
1148.68,1149.88, the transition happens in half life.
1149.88,1153.36, It's like this really weird and bizarre.
1153.36,1156.56," It's like you just turn up their, their brain just shuts off like when they get hit"
1156.56,1157.56, in a leg or something.
1157.56,1161.1599999999999, They do like the classic cowboy thing where they get shot and then grab their stomach
1161.1599999999999,1163.84, type thing and then like really slowly fall forward.
1163.84,1167.12," But there's not even like falling, it doesn't even match up that way."
1167.12,1169.36," It's not like, you don't get the sense like I shot this guy here."
1169.36,1172.0, He's feeling it there and then he's going to fall in this direction.
1172.0,1175.76, It's like they're falling any which way then they get stuck in the walls or they float
1175.76,1178.36, in the sky and they just disappear.
1178.36,1179.76," Yeah, it's what is they die."
1179.76,1180.76, Don't disappear.
1180.76,1181.76, Maybe they're magic Nazi.
1181.76,1182.76," Yeah, it's Nazi magic."
1182.76,1185.96, It's like probably is man.
1185.96,1188.36, That's why I tied concept.
1188.36,1189.96, But that was the turning point.
1189.96,1190.96, It's just not fun.
1190.96,1192.36, It's just not even fun to shoot him.
1192.36,1193.36, It was like half the time.
1193.36,1195.36," It doesn't look like, am I hitting this guy?"
1195.36,1196.36, Like what's happening?
1196.36,1198.16, So why are we picking on this game?
1198.16,1200.96, Because it seems like it's kind of like a little because it got to see plus.
1200.96,1207.28, I'm talking about it just because I played it for something a PC game that came out last
1207.28,1208.96, week to talk about on a podcast.
1208.96,1210.76, It's a stencil right about PC gaming.
1211.76,1212.76, I'm not asking.
1212.76,1214.36, I'm not asking you to be defensive.
1214.36,1215.36, I'm just saying it seems.
1215.36,1216.56, I'm telling you how it is.
1216.56,1221.56, It just seems like a kind of a I've seen a lot of commercials for this game.
1221.56,1222.56, Really?
1222.56,1224.16, It could have been it could have been pretty cool.
1224.16,1228.16, That as played out as that scenario is it's still it.
1228.16,1229.16, I don't know.
1229.16,1232.16," I mean, it's it's still different right from from other games."
1232.16,1233.56, Like they're not many.
1233.56,1237.96, I don't know of any other like shooters at PS's in the past few years that I basically
1237.96,1239.76, run through this scenario.
1239.76,1244.52," And it's I mean, I don't know that they did some things right when you started off"
1244.52,1245.96, it like this might be actually pretty cool.
1245.96,1248.56," I was wondering I was like, why was Roy you saying he hated it so much?"
1248.56,1250.16, Was that game freedom fighters?
1250.16,1251.56, Is that the one that free fighters?
1251.56,1253.56," Yeah, so it's one."
1253.56,1255.3600000000001," Yeah, that had a similar enough."
1255.3600000000001,1258.96, Obviously not the same parties involved for the similarly like what if scenario.
1258.96,1259.96," Yeah, that was one."
1259.96,1260.96, That was awesome.
1260.96,1263.96," I mean, that was one of those games."
1263.96,1267.56, The guys that made K&Linch when I was like before K&Linch came out.
1268.36,1269.36, I was excited for it.
1269.36,1271.36," You know, it's like he's guessing me this game."
1271.96,1274.96, The thing the bothersome the most is that it's a games for Windows game.
1275.1599999999999,1276.96, That that's the weird thing about it.
1276.96,1282.36," Yeah, that I mean, and oh, and other stuff, you know, the whole PC interface."
1282.36,1285.56," It's like, yeah, you can't if you want to switch weapons, you have to use the mouse wheel."
1285.56,1288.56, You can't press your number keys to switch between Raymond to read.
1288.56,1290.1599999999999, Just other like basic stuff.
1290.1599999999999,1291.96," There's no, you know, you can't quick save."
1291.96,1292.76, Can't do anything.
1292.76,1297.36," I mean, maybe that's why like the one for 360 got like a C plus because maybe it was."
1297.36,1299.56, It was just designed so heavily for console.
1300.1599999999999,1300.56, I know.
1300.56,1302.76, I was I was playing another game for Windows title.
1302.76,1306.9599999999998, That was a console portal that we can I got really way into Viva Pinata again.
1307.76,1308.76, And it's got the same.
1308.76,1309.56, The Pima version.
1309.56,1310.76," Yeah, and that's my Microsoft."
1310.76,1316.1599999999999, Do you would assume that they would put in the effort to maybe there's not even one degree of separation.
1316.1599999999999,1316.9599999999998, But direct.
1316.9599999999998,1318.36," Yeah, it's got the same issues though."
1318.36,1322.56, It's got like they added a few predetermined hotkeys to like go on the certain menus.
1322.56,1324.56, But you can't reassign any of them.
1324.56,1327.1599999999999, There's hotkeys that should totally be there for the.
1327.16,1332.16," Because it's just a menu because you're like, I want to go straight to the fricking, you know,"
1332.16,1337.5600000000002," seed store, but you have to move your mouse up to the yellow button, which is still left over from."
1337.5600000000002,1339.3600000000001, You can't just buy it until eight or something.
1339.3600000000001,1341.96," Yeah, and you can't rebuy in any of your like shovel like that."
1341.96,1342.76, It's a little better.
1342.76,1348.3600000000001," It's like the camera controls at least they tried a little bit, at least they did give you three"
1348.3600000000001,1349.3600000000001, predetermined hotkeys.
1349.3600000000001,1350.96, So you don't have to you go to the right.
1350.96,1351.96, Don't many of every time.
1351.96,1352.96, How is it?
1353.3600000000001,1359.16," I mean, how long does it take to make it so that you can control a pointer with the mouse on a menu, though?"
1359.16,1361.3600000000001," And no, that bare minimum effort."
1361.3600000000001,1362.3600000000001, Like that's said.
1362.3600000000001,1364.56," And yeah, like that's the weird thing."
1364.56,1367.3600000000001," I mean, like that's like another you take it for granted."
1367.3600000000001,1370.16, You have a piece of game you can configure the keys and any way you want.
1370.16,1373.56, And with the this is if people pull point with to try to.
1374.56,1378.76, To have some standardization here and some like guaranteed of quality.
1378.76,1380.3600000000001, So the fundamental thing.
1380.3600000000001,1382.3600000000001, I'm not even able to select with the menu.
1382.96,1387.96," I mean, how is that not just like an object failure, right?"
1387.96,1389.3600000000001, To have that branding.
1389.3600000000001,1391.3600000000001," Yeah, we can't at least give you that."
1391.3600000000001,1393.56, So it's bad.
1393.56,1397.56," I mean, there's like there's all kinds of stuff, right?"
1397.56,1402.16," They're, they're in a situation where they don't want to impose too many restrictions"
1402.16,1407.3600000000001, because they're trying to get you get developers and publishers to go for the branding in the first place.
1407.3600000000001,1409.96," And if they're like, well, we're going to be in control of all these things."
1409.96,1412.56, And you have to meet all these different criteria.
1412.56,1417.3600000000001," And that's just going to be in and if the publisher's like, well, this is just like a heap of extra headache for us."
1417.3600000000001,1423.56," And right, and so far, there's no statistics that show this branding is going to increase our sales."
1423.56,1424.56, Why bother.
1424.56,1427.76," So Microsoft really had to say, hey, let's go."
1427.76,1432.96," Let's go forward with this and just, you know, we'll put your, we'll put the brand on your on your box."
1432.96,1434.16, And you just have to.
1434.16,1435.96," Well, then, then, then, okay, but it's a record there."
1435.96,1437.56," Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry."
1437.56,1439.76, This device that's been around for 25 years.
1439.76,1440.96, I'm not a music game.
1440.96,1446.16," I'm saying, I'm just me, the knowledge that like there's I see that's the only reason I can see for it."
1446.16,1451.16, But then the downside now is that the branding is absolutely meaningless.
1451.16,1451.96, It says nothing.
1451.96,1452.56, It's a team.
1452.56,1452.96, It's a team.
1452.96,1454.36," Yeah, if anything, it's he's right."
1454.36,1455.36, It's painting it now.
1455.36,1457.96," There's going to play those and be like, fuck game for Windows games."
1457.96,1458.76, He is a night.
1458.76,1461.96, It's just going to be another one of those that reminds me to plug in the 360 controller.
1461.96,1462.76, I'm supposed to buy.
1464.36,1469.56," Hey, yes, the Anthony did just give me a good idea if if fuck games for Windows"
1469.56,1473.96," becomes kind of the new mantra, then we could just be FGFW radio."
1477.56,1477.96, I think we can.
1477.96,1480.56, And that was my last last podcast.
1480.56,1482.1599999999999, Your last official word is.
1484.56,1485.96," Yeah, she's writing up here."
1485.96,1487.96, So is there any redeeming qualities?
1487.96,1489.56," I mean, the high concept here."
1489.56,1490.56, I guess.
1490.56,1491.56, Is that.
1491.56,1492.56, Is that.
1492.56,1494.56, We're trying to find some some ray of sunshine.
1494.56,1495.96, I'm looking for a ray of sunshine.
1495.96,1496.56, I don't know.
1496.56,1497.56, I got an attention.
1497.56,1498.56, I think I like that.
1498.56,1503.56," By the time I finished, did I agreed with Roy that it was like never recommend it under any circumstances."
1503.56,1504.56, Anyone.
1504.56,1506.56," Yeah, I mean, at least for the price it is now."
1506.56,1508.56, If it.
1508.56,1510.56," I don't. Yeah, that was a lot of it."
1510.56,1511.56, I can't.
1512.56,1513.56, Last line of his.
1513.56,1515.56, Is this a full price game?
1515.56,1516.56, Yeah.
1517.56,1519.56," It's like, yeah, it's supposed to be a major reason."
1519.56,1520.56, It's a lot of people.
1520.56,1522.56," You know, and we look at the buzz of meter on one up."
1522.56,1524.56," It was it's been, you know, like in the top 10."
1524.56,1526.56, That's because there's a lot of how the fuck it got to see plus.
1526.56,1527.56, There's a lot of marketing behind it.
1527.56,1529.56, For sure.
1529.56,1531.56, So obviously that could be speaking to it.
1531.56,1532.56," Like, all right."
1532.56,1534.56, It was a game that there were cover stories on it.
1534.56,1536.56, I think it was like PlayStation Magazine or something.
1536.56,1538.56, One of those had a cover story on it.
1538.56,1541.56," And it was, I mean, again, I feel bad for him."
1541.56,1543.56," I mean, they're clearly working under, you know,"
1543.56,1545.56, imperfect circumstances.
1545.56,1548.56," They had, you know, various conditions they had to deal with."
1548.56,1550.56, But that get the end.
1550.56,1551.56, It just doesn't.
1551.56,1553.56, It doesn't mean much to the consumer that they're talking.
1553.56,1556.56, Saying that the game is for when they're saying that their reviewers are getting
1557.56,1558.56, it all wrong.
1558.56,1559.56, But right.
1559.56,1560.56, So don't think anyone was wanting it.
1560.56,1562.56," As I had, this is need to be revolutionary."
1562.56,1563.56, This does not like again.
1563.56,1564.56, This need to be day effects.
1564.56,1565.56, The day that it came out.
1565.56,1567.56," It's like, just make it work."
1567.56,1570.56," And if it's dumb fun with like, and you're having, you know,"
1570.56,1573.56," a decent time with the scenario, then that could work."
1573.56,1575.56," And the other problem is this, you know, right,"
1575.56,1576.56, you set up this environment.
1576.56,1578.56," You're like, what would happen?"
1578.56,1580.56," What would happen to the various, I mean,"
1580.56,1582.56," because, you know, especially NYC,"
1582.56,1584.56," the demographics are, you know, very diverse."
1584.56,1586.56, What would happen if the Nazis really did get in here?
1586.56,1587.56," What are, what were the,"
1587.56,1590.56, what can the people that live there expect to see on a daily basis?
1590.56,1591.56, How is all this going to play out?
1591.56,1594.56," And it's very, you know, serious and dark subject matter."
1594.56,1596.56," But the other thing is that they, because the,"
1596.56,1599.56," the game, the characters look so shitty,"
1599.56,1604.56," and they're so unable to, to act, you know,"
1604.56,1606.56, in a traditional sense to deliver any kind of lines
1606.56,1607.56, when you're looking at them.
1607.56,1609.56," Maybe if you just hear someone talk in,"
1609.56,1612.56," that it just kind of throws all that possibility for,"
1612.56,1615.56," for storytelling and digging into that out the window,"
1615.56,1617.56," because when you look at someone and he's telling you something,"
1617.56,1619.56, all you could do is laugh at his face.
1619.56,1620.56, Mm-hmm.
1620.56,1622.56," Did you say, sorry, did you say something?"
1622.56,1626.56," How like dark as it trying to get, is it like explicit?"
1626.56,1630.56," It's not very, there are a few scenes where you see some people in the street"
1630.56,1632.56," and they're, you know, they're being shot,"
1632.56,1634.56," but it's like, it doesn't really go anywhere."
1634.56,1635.56," It's not, they're just regular white people."
1635.56,1638.56," It's not like you see blacks or Jews or,"
1638.56,1639.56," or, you know, anything like that."
1639.56,1641.56," There's, I think there's, I was waiting to find, you know,"
1641.56,1645.56," characters that sort of talk to spoke to the richness of,"
1645.56,1648.56," you know, the ethnic makeup of New York City, even in, you know,"
1648.56,1650.56," 19, well, set in 51."
1650.56,1653.56," And I saw there's one black character, the whole game,"
1653.56,1655.56," and then everyone else, as far as I can tell,"
1655.56,1657.56," they're almost like the same character model, you know,"
1657.56,1658.56, is it all in New York City?
1658.56,1659.56, Yeah.
1659.56,1661.56," No, doesn't, you go to the White House."
1661.56,1664.56," Oh, you know, you go to England."
1664.56,1668.56," You go to, you, you, you, what is the deal with this shit?"
1668.56,1671.56," They, they, you fight on Big Ben and on the London Bridge."
1671.56,1674.56," For some reason, they decided fight on Big Ben."
1674.56,1676.56, Yeah. And then you fighting V.
1676.56,1680.56, That's he's decided to park all their tanks on the London Bridge.
1680.56,1683.56, And so there's a scene where you pull the lever.
1683.56,1686.56," It's like a drop bridge, and then all the tanks slide off."
1686.56,1688.56, But they're parked at all these like crazy angles on it.
1688.56,1690.56," And when they're supposed to be, you know,"
1690.56,1692.56, sliding off and blowing up.
1692.56,1694.56, They slide like cardboard boxes.
1694.56,1696.56," It's worse than, yeah, it's worse than like,"
1696.56,1698.56," you know, the action scene in Godzilla from, you know,"
1698.56,1700.56," like, 1955 or something."
1700.56,1702.56," You know, we're, it's like the dumbest models of fire,"
1702.56,1704.56," black hat, firecrackers popping off in them."
1704.56,1706.56," It looks worse than that, right?"
1706.56,1707.56, There's a tank tank.
1707.56,1710.56, And it looks like it's sliding at about all the half of mile an hour.
1710.56,1712.56, And it touches like some other vehicle.
1712.56,1713.56, And then they just burst into flame.
1713.56,1714.56, And then they're falling off.
1714.56,1717.56, But it's like moon gravity is they're falling off a bridge.
1717.56,1720.56, And it's just the London Bridge is a powerful thing.
1720.56,1723.56," So yeah, you do get to go to,"
1724.56,1726.56, you go to the white house and all the pictures a link in
1726.56,1728.56, are on the floor and shit like that.
1728.56,1731.56," Yeah, there's a, there's a collaborator president."
1731.56,1733.56, He's just this fat guy and he's a boss.
1733.56,1736.56," So that means he can take like three clips and I guess that they,"
1736.56,1738.56, you have to shoot the president.
1738.56,1741.56," Yeah, well, he's, he's not my president."
1741.56,1743.56," He's just a collaborator, you know, he's like,"
1743.56,1746.56," yeah, he's just another Nazi puppet."
1746.56,1747.56," And he's just, just, just this name,"
1747.56,1748.56," in fact, piece of shit."
1748.56,1751.56, I was too eager to shoot him to listen to his name.
1751.56,1752.56, He's a turned coat.
1752.56,1754.56," You're feeling, welcome the Nazi race."
1754.56,1755.56, I'm afraid.
1755.56,1756.56, I'm afraid.
1756.56,1757.56, I'm afraid.
1757.56,1759.56," But he took a little, he took a little."
1759.56,1760.56, Few too many bullets.
1760.56,1762.56," So for, for my liking."
1762.56,1763.56," There's one of those things, you know,"
1763.56,1765.56," yeah, this happens in a lot of games."
1765.56,1767.56, It happened in soldier fortune payback.
1767.56,1770.56," Like, how are we going to have a boss in a game that's supposed to,"
1770.56,1772.56," that for the most part, grounded in reality or"
1772.56,1773.56, the version of it?
1773.56,1775.56," Well, you just increase their hit points."
1775.56,1778.56," And instead what happens is you have in, in soldier fortune,"
1778.56,1780.56, you have an Arab or an Afghan or in this game.
1780.56,1786.56," You have like the turntable person running around, talking shit at you as you just shoot him in the face over and over again."
1786.56,1787.56, And he can't do anything.
1787.56,1788.56, He has no like cool behavior.
1788.56,1793.56," He's not like ducking or dodging your, your bullets and other superhuman fees just sitting there like,"
1793.56,1795.56," ah, you're like,"
1795.56,1797.56," okay, I see."
1797.56,1800.56, So this president doesn't like grow like twice as normal size.
1800.56,1803.56, Like halfway through get a ring of fire around him.
1803.56,1808.56, He's got a big apparatus where he gets to go get injections every like 25% of his health bar.
1808.56,1816.56, Or he feeds on like human embryos and like Coke 24 packs.
1816.56,1820.56," That's from, you know, read the Frank Miller and Jeff Darryl,"
1820.56,1821.56, graphic novel Hard Boyle.
1821.56,1822.56, No.
1822.56,1823.56, And you went in this room.
1823.56,1825.56," That's on my, like, pilot shame, basically."
1825.56,1827.56, It's a really crazy craft.
1827.56,1833.56," No, but there's like this big guy who runs some crazy corporation and he's plugged into a machine."
1833.56,1837.56," And he's like the guy that has to get around with like a giant mechanical wheel chair,"
1837.56,1842.56, but it takes it to such an extreme that he's like far bigger than Baron Harcoan and in doing or something.
1842.56,1847.56, And he's got like you see all these slide racks that are running into feed feed them and they're being processed.
1847.56,1850.56," The liquids and shit that go into his body and it's just, you know,"
1850.56,1855.56," hunters and hunters, a coat can't in a bunch of like feedesses and just all kinds of Bayes,"
1855.56,1857.56, and all the random shit.
1857.56,1859.56, Could be a one up.
1859.56,1860.56," I like,"
1860.56,1863.56," I was like, again, to buy off shot."
1863.56,1866.56, A couple of guys upstairs kind of look like that.
1866.56,1869.56, I've been waiting for someone to make a game based on hardwill.
1869.56,1872.56," It would be it just, it's this crazy dystopian world."
1872.56,1875.56," And like if you, if you were to make like a grand theft auto type game, that's the other thing, right?"
1875.56,1877.56," That kind of game, like a GTA yet this world."
1877.56,1879.56," And there's a few people that have done things with it,"
1879.56,1883.56," but it's for the most part, everyone is trying to cash in specifically on that same formula."
1883.56,1884.56, Sure.
1884.56,1885.56, So it's got to be thugs and stuff.
1885.56,1887.56, But take anything like that and make.
1887.56,1894.56, Take the same principles of the game and then just use because what those games do well is communicate a space a world.
1894.56,1897.56," Well, that's what Crackdown did. You weren't a thug in that."
1897.56,1904.56, But it Crackdown was just basically dial the random year generator up about like two decades.
1904.56,1905.56, And then it's still GTA.
1905.56,1908.56, There's still like the little town like where the Latinos fight.
1908.56,1910.56, There's like the little like triad Asian town.
1910.56,1913.56, There's the Russian mafia.
1913.56,1918.56," I mean, there's basically GTA with incredible Hulk style jumping."
1918.56,1919.56," I don't, I think it's a great game."
1919.56,1921.56," I don't own, I mean, I think it's absolutely fun."
1921.56,1924.56," But the story of it though, it's not that different from."
1924.56,1926.56," Okay, that's true."
1926.56,1932.56," Well, it's like there's thugs along, you know, different mafia's along, like very clearly divided at the content."
1932.56,1935.56," Okay, go to their little burrows and then just chill the big ones."
1935.56,1938.56, Do like the thug crimes.
1938.56,1940.56, There's thug crimes.
1940.56,1943.56," You don't, but they're, I mean, it's still, you're the cop in this case."
1943.56,1944.56, Yeah.
1944.56,1946.56, It's a good twist.
1946.56,1947.56, It's a twist.
1947.56,1949.56, It's a two high concept for me.
1949.56,1953.56," Well, the, the Sims three is going to be a virtual open world."
1953.56,1954.56, Like how I did that.
1954.56,1955.56, That was not like the best.
1955.56,1956.56, I've ever heard of.
1956.56,1957.56, Thank you.
1957.56,1958.56, Thank you very much.
1958.56,1961.56, Except it gets ruined when you point it out that it was such a good segue.
1961.56,1962.56, Yeah.
1962.56,1966.56," Don't say, say, because everyone, there's so many people in the internet that I see."
1966.56,1971.56," It's like the new bias, you know how there's like about 10% of internet users can properly conjugate the word bias."
1971.56,1972.56, Yeah.
1972.56,1973.56," Now, it's like way appears."
1973.56,1975.56," CG, W A like a little spider."
1975.56,1976.56, Yeah.
1976.56,1977.56, Like the punk.
1977.56,1979.56, The internet is going to be retired about everything.
1979.56,1980.56," Remember, we're in company here."
1980.56,1984.56, It was the other day in that guy kept on trying to be really racist and call people diaper heads.
1984.56,1985.56," Oh, yeah."
1985.56,1989.56, I kept on saying DIPR until Rory just lost on that dude.
1989.56,1990.56, Said.
1990.56,1993.56," Well, the next time you do feel like writing some kind of internet flame."
1993.56,1995.56, Now that it's about S.E.G.U.E.
1995.56,1996.56, Yes.
1996.56,1997.56, Yes.
1997.56,2000.56, It will be a lot from the editors of GFW radio.
2000.56,2001.56, And segue.
2001.56,2005.56," For the old one, it, do not write you are bias or he is bias."
2005.56,2009.56," Also, if you're playing World of Warcraft, they're not rouges."
2009.56,2010.56, They're wrong.
2010.56,2012.56, And it's not a chance.
2012.56,2015.56, It's not the forces of chaos.
2015.56,2017.56, And they're not chaos emeralds.
2017.56,2018.56, All right.
2018.56,2020.56," How do you get it's paladin, right?"
2020.56,2023.56, Because I always hear people missay it all the time too.
2023.56,2026.56," Well, lad and pull that and no, I'm totally serious."
2026.56,2027.56," You know, I'm totally serious."
2027.56,2028.56," You know, I'm paladin."
2028.56,2029.56, This is there's a human.
2029.56,2034.56," Oh, I want to let you get to talk on Sims, but there's one other thing that fits this."
2034.56,2036.56, And it's a unique problem.
2036.56,2040.56," And when we play games like company heroes, where there are a lot of German words."
2040.56,2043.56," And then there's a matter of like, well, it will it be douchey, if I say,"
2043.56,2048.56," fall from your anger or if I say like gag tiger, or should I just say,"
2048.56,2051.56," or are there someone in the server saying, jagged tiger, jagged panther?"
2051.56,2053.56," And you're like, you know that ain't right."
2053.56,2054.56, Right.
2054.56,2056.56, But it's kind of like douchey to correct them.
2056.56,2059.56," It's like that's, it's like you know, no, to get out."
2059.56,2062.56," But I think they should in the world of Warcraft when someone's like,"
2062.56,2066.56," someone's like, kill jaden and then someone's like, it's kill jadeen."
2066.56,2070.56," But I think at the same point, that's like why when we're playing company heroes,"
2070.56,2075.56," everyone, like, just goes into their fake German accent to make it like funny that they're actually"
2075.56,2076.56, saying it the right way.
2076.56,2078.56," Yeah, we need to go show me."
2078.56,2079.56, There you go.
2079.56,2082.56, That's what we do.
2082.56,2083.56, That's what we do.
2083.56,2086.56," That's like, that's how we get a little ground."
2086.56,2088.56, Make light of it.
2088.56,2091.56," So yeah, the Sims three, right?"
2091.56,2095.56, So we could talk about that now because the embargo is lifted.
2095.56,2096.56," Oh, like a face."
2096.56,2099.56," And yeah, so there it's it's GTA."
2099.56,2101.56, It's Sims GTA.
2101.56,2105.56," There could I have, you could not do more false assumptions."
2105.56,2106.56, What does that mean?
2106.56,2109.56," Yeah, you go in a in a stressor's house and pee in their toilet."
2109.56,2110.56, It doesn't mean anything.
2110.56,2112.56, You got different neighborhood cars.
2112.56,2113.56, Psyched.
2113.56,2117.56," Just like in GTA, you got the neighborhoods with people who who wet themselves."
2117.56,2119.56, You got the neighborhood of people.
2119.56,2120.56, Excellent fishermen.
2120.56,2121.56," Yeah, right."
2121.56,2122.56, Time to get.
2122.56,2123.56," No, okay."
2123.56,2124.56, It's not like this at all.
2124.56,2125.56, We've stuck with it for real.
2125.56,2128.56, Can you kill hookers?
2128.56,2130.56," Yeah, that was that was their first directive."
2130.56,2131.56, Let's be okay.
2131.56,2132.56, Let Sims play your kill.
2132.56,2134.56, But GTA's all about killing hookers.
2134.56,2135.56, Stealing car.
2135.56,2136.56," Okay, same stat Thompson."
2136.56,2139.56," Yeah, that's not even like cars to steal in this game."
2139.56,2140.56, Yeah.
2140.56,2141.56, Right.
2141.56,2142.56, So what's so great about this game?
2142.56,2143.56, Okay.
2143.56,2146.56," So if you played the Sims or the Sims two, you know that."
2146.56,2148.56," Basically, you're playing one house at a time."
2148.56,2152.56, It's like a little instance to use an MMO word because they were using MMO words a lot during
2152.56,2153.56, our visit.
2153.56,2154.56, They certainly were.
2154.56,2157.56," Basically, you're four people exist in a bubble."
2157.56,2161.56, And when you call people over to visit to socialize or whatever they kind of exist for
2161.56,2165.56," that brief amount of time and then vanish, you can go back to their cryogenic chambers to go back to sleep."
2165.56,2171.56, So the whole thing here is you got the whole town kind of simulating at the same time.
2171.56,2177.56," So, you know, use your scroll wheel to zoom into your house, use it to zoom out and you can see the whole, you know,"
2177.56,2181.56, all of your neighborhood and all the people walking around in the downtown area.
2181.56,2186.56," So that's the big, that's like a big, how many of those citizens can you control,"
2186.56,2188.56, you're controlling one household at a time.
2188.56,2193.56," You only control yourself just like, or the people in your house just like you do in the other"
2193.56,2198.56," Sims games, the differences that all these other people in the town are evolving along with you."
2198.56,2202.56," They're living, they have, they're going on their own things, they're interacting with one another."
2202.56,2209.56," And they all have their own little stories, but if you get involved with them, you will fundamentally change whatever's happening."
2209.56,2213.56," So they're a little store for example, like say if you hook up with another one of them, right?"
2213.56,2215.56, It's true Sims dating style.
2215.56,2220.56, Then you can go and spy on them and see that they might actually be cheating on you.
2220.56,2222.56," Yes, that will happen."
2222.56,2229.56," Or you could actually steal that you could hook up with somebody married in one of the other houses, steal the dude's wife,"
2229.56,2232.56," get a new house in, you know, in that town."
2232.56,2235.56, And then you see what happens to that guy who's been dumped over time.
2235.56,2244.56," Yeah, and you might be very controlled level in the other Sims because you could bring in other households and go to, you know,"
2244.56,2245.56, that's the right thing.
2245.56,2250.56, But they kind of went on the shelf in between when you were at the right time.
2250.56,2253.56," One thing is that literally, I mean, they're aging with you."
2253.56,2258.56," So in the old in Sims 2, which introduced the aging concept, you would age."
2258.56,2261.56, But the rest of the world wouldn't.
2261.56,2263.56," So you know, you get that theoretically theoretically."
2263.56,2266.56," You were older than your dad than the empires, man."
2266.56,2267.56, Basically.
2267.56,2269.56," Yeah, yeah, it's like, what is that? I am legend."
2269.56,2272.56," Second, you totally, though, we went right."
2272.56,2273.56, Yeah.
2273.56,2276.56, So the town will evolve over generations along along with you.
2276.56,2281.56," So what happens if you do say you do hook up with someone else, then you decide to get married."
2281.56,2282.56, You have the option.
2282.56,2285.56, It sounds like to then control the new household.
2285.56,2287.56," Like say you want to same time, like both of them."
2287.56,2291.56," No, I think you would, the other ones, I think you would, like, save it instance of your town."
2291.56,2295.56," If you wanted to keep playing with that other family and like another entire other game,"
2295.56,2296.56, basically.
2296.56,2301.56, But then you could start a new version with your new little family.
2301.56,2303.56, And then the other ones would become AI.
2303.56,2306.56," So what would happen if like, my parents died."
2306.56,2308.56, And now their house is empty.
2308.56,2310.56, And I've moved on to control like a new family.
2310.56,2314.56," Like, they're just being empty house on the block now where the old people died."
2314.56,2315.56, Probably.
2315.56,2318.56, So it's not all moved in unless some maybe they have squatters.
2318.56,2319.56, Yeah.
2319.56,2320.56," I mean, you have to tell them to get pumped."
2320.56,2325.56, You have complete control to like kick people out and put drop people into your universe.
2325.56,2329.56," So yeah, if you want to re-seat the house, then you totally can."
2329.56,2330.56, How much interaction is there?
2330.56,2335.56," Say, for example, this is almost like something out of fabel two where you go and."
2335.56,2340.56," I have to use some crude terms here, but your taps on one's mom and the kids, the kids see."
2340.56,2344.56," Like, this is like, games all about is the kid going to like, is the kid going to create a big house?"
2344.56,2350.56, Or is it just like an old's in traditional Sims where someone like you could see that they're sad or that they're happy?
2350.56,2354.56, They didn't this kid likes why that they would go.
2354.56,2355.56, Yeah.
2355.56,2356.56, I'm sure.
2356.56,2357.56," Yeah, you never know."
2357.56,2358.56, They'll say way.
2358.56,2360.56, Maybe that's what it was.
2360.56,2364.56," Maybe that's one of his traits is like like, yeah, kinky shit or something."
2364.56,2365.56, Right.
2365.56,2366.56," Well, that's the other thing."
2366.56,2369.56," Yeah, he can't like set fire to your house or anything, right?"
2369.56,2371.56," You know, I don't know."
2372.56,2380.56," I doubt it. I doubt he, but the Sims are going to be predisposed to, you know, to judge you, you know, to hate you or like you."
2380.56,2383.56, It seems like more than than in the other games.
2383.56,2386.56," Well, the they have, we'll have to switch gears from other."
2386.56,2387.56, Right.
2387.56,2388.56, Another system here.
2388.56,2395.56," So they're dumping again, if you play the Sims, you know that when you make a character, when you're making a Sim or any Sim that exists out there has."
2395.56,2402.56," A series of personality traits that are basically sliders like need to, to, to, you know, need to sloppy or active delady."
2402.56,2404.56, So that system's gone.
2404.56,2407.56, They've replaced it with this list.
2407.56,2409.56, I think they came up with what 80 to 100.
2409.56,2410.56, So around 80s.
2410.56,2411.56, Yeah.
2411.56,2418.56," 80 traits, which are basically they pulled them from like, yeah, who personal ads kind of things like love the outdoor or the way to do maniac or, you know,"
2418.56,2419.56," it doesn't know, yeah, who personal traits."
2419.56,2420.56," Well, no, but."
2421.56,2422.56," So I mean, you're on the first person."
2422.56,2426.56," The good ones, the good ones, right, who personal traits."
2426.56,2430.56," But yeah, they're basically descriptors and you pick five of them."
2430.56,2436.56," So, but, you know, theoretically, if there's a descriptor that's just like, you know, arsonist."
2436.56,2441.56," And also a descriptor that's like, you know, hasty see his mom screwing around on him."
2441.56,2442.56, Yeah.
2442.56,2445.56, Then maybe they would put the two together and go behave like that.
2445.56,2446.56, I don't know what the full list is.
2446.56,2450.56," And some of the traits definitely were like, you know, not flattering at all."
2450.56,2454.56," Right. I mean, they had ones that were super, you know, like not cool."
2454.56,2456.56," You know, inappropriate was one I remember they showed us."
2456.56,2460.56, So like that dude would like say the wrong thing at the wrong time.
2460.56,2461.56, I'm not saying that.
2461.56,2462.56, So the tattoo I'm just for the ready.
2462.56,2464.56, Touch someone before they're ready.
2464.56,2468.56," You know, like, how in this game's the always had to like work it up."
2468.56,2469.56," They're like, sure."
2469.56,2471.56," I'll tell you a joke and then you're like, hug."
2471.56,2473.56," Oh, there's another thing that changed."
2473.56,2475.56, Because that's kind of an opt-in thing now.
2475.56,2477.56," Whereas before they were totally, that's right."
2477.56,2482.56, Like any positive relationship it seemed would inevitably get into the touchy feeling
2482.56,2484.56, Romantic stuff no matter what you wanted to do with it.
2484.56,2489.56, This is now kind of like you have to specifically pick to go down the romance tree.
2489.56,2494.56," More or less so you can like be friends with people with people without like,"
2494.56,2497.56, looking at another room and coming back and finding a making out.
2497.56,2499.56, Do you get like two benefits from this?
2499.56,2501.56, Like can you borrow stuff from them?
2501.56,2504.56," I mean, you, I'm basically, well, I don't know, maybe I'm looking for the wrong game,"
2504.56,2507.56," but like I like this idea that I'm forming in my head, listening to you at the,"
2507.56,2513.56," like basically sport, but on an odd, out of social level, entirely between, you know,"
2513.56,2517.56, the social sport meets desperate housewives or something.
2517.56,2518.56, Right.
2518.56,2519.56," I mean, that's kind of..."
2519.56,2523.56," I think there is some of this isn't foreign by sport for sure, a little bit."
2523.56,2527.56," I mean, you know, obviously the Sims 1 was Will Wright's game."
2527.56,2529.56," He is not working on Sims 3,"
2529.56,2531.56," but you know, they're in touch with them."
2531.56,2533.56," I mean, obviously there's just the same company still."
2533.56,2534.56, Right.
2534.56,2537.56, And a ton of people from Sims 2 are working on this one.
2537.56,2541.56, So it's not like it's a whole new team that just has nothing to do with it.
2541.56,2542.56, Right.
2542.56,2545.56, So I think you can probably find the parallels.
2545.56,2548.56," I mean, the most interesting to me and think to me and certainly, you know,"
2548.56,2552.56, we're talking about this the first time that we've seen it.
2552.56,2558.56," There's like so much to do, but what I liked was that there was some ambition going on here."
2558.56,2559.56, Yeah.
2559.56,2563.56," You know, that there's there's clearly trying to do something different."
2563.56,2566.56," They were clearly trying to, um,"
2566.56,2572.56," I don't know, in a way kind of sees the game back from the phenomenon just that it had become."
2572.56,2574.56, I'm just basically dressed up dolls.
2574.56,2575.56, Yeah.
2575.56,2576.56, Right.
2576.56,2581.56," And I don't know how many expansions of Sims 2 that were, but certainly more than any of us really particularly needed."
2581.56,2586.56," So some small time even, like if you've been friend your neighbors and you have good relations with your neighbors,"
2586.56,2591.56," then when you open a lemonade stand or some kind of business, then they're likely to patronize it."
2591.56,2596.56, And then that's a material feedback because you're going to get more money and then you can use that on something you want.
2596.56,2598.56," Or if you're like, it should hit everyone."
2598.56,2603.56," Then they're all kind of like ostracize you and then that there's some consequence for that, you know."
2603.56,2609.56," I mean, yeah, I mean, the business aspect isn't necessarily one particular element."
2609.56,2611.56, I don't think you really can open up a business and this one.
2611.56,2612.56, That's for expansion.
2612.56,2613.56, That's expansion material.
2613.56,2614.56, Right.
2614.56,2617.56," And it's obviously because that's always been part of it, but that's."
2617.56,2619.56, And it's still jobs.
2619.56,2625.56," This is something that's always sort of bugged me, but I always saw where they come from where they're coming from and why they do this is when you go to work."
2625.56,2634.56," You're essentially like, you're your Sims off limits at work because do you really want to chop broccoli all day if that's what they're job is."
2634.56,2635.56, That's what they're in my head.
2635.56,2639.56," And like, well, yeah, I think I can think of some jobs where that would be cool."
2639.56,2643.56, Like I would kind of want to go to an office and manipulate the office environment and like.
2643.56,2646.56, Deal with like cubicle dynamics.
2646.56,2647.56, But they never.
2647.56,2649.56, And I guess open for business.
2649.56,2650.56, Maybe touched on that.
2650.56,2654.56," I never touched a little expansion pack, but that's something they're still keeping out of it."
2654.56,2659.56," It's just like when you go into your office, you kind of off limits till you emerge from it."
2659.56,2661.56, But then that's like a big social space.
2661.56,2662.56, But what is what?
2662.56,2667.56, What is interesting though is that the job tracks themselves are very different now.
2667.56,2672.56," Whereas in Sims 2, there was a specific way to get ahead in your career."
2672.56,2675.56, And I was basically like a bolt list or a quest in a way.
2675.56,2678.56," Oh, so yeah, befriend these five people do this or whatever."
2678.56,2685.56," Now it's it's trait based in other words, you can get ahead in a certain career."
2685.56,2689.56," Based on what your personality is like, you can play to those strengths."
2689.56,2691.56, There's an any particular requirement.
2691.56,2694.56, You can like sleep the way sleep your way to the top.
2694.56,2695.56, Exactly.
2695.56,2701.56," If your trade is like, gougariousness or whatever, it's possible that your character will get a raise just by sleeping with the boss."
2701.56,2708.56," Whereas if you're a bookworm, you'll get ahead by reading and advancing, you know, getting more intelligent in that particular."
2708.56,2714.56," Right. And then, but your boss is in this case, you know, when they leave the office building, they're going back to their lives."
2714.56,2721.56," So like if they decide that they don't really want to sleep with you anymore, and they hook up with someone else who works at the movie theater or whatever."
2721.56,2726.56, Then suddenly that could totally destroy your career because like your end is gone.
2726.56,2727.56, So that kind of stuff.
2727.56,2728.56, Right.
2728.56,2729.56, Right.
2729.56,2739.56, Yeah. And I also like to fact that like it's not randomized at the start of the game for anybody. So we all go out and buy some three on day one.
2739.56,2746.56, And that village or that town is the same for every one of us. And yet.
2746.56,2750.56, How it then evolves is going to be totally up to us.
2750.56,2751.56, Right.
2751.56,2756.56," As opposed to, but it's offline entirely. So there's no way to compare outcomes, right?"
2756.56,2757.56, Unless you're in their house.
2757.56,2759.56," I mean, I think going into stuff right now."
2759.56,2774.56," Before we like when we knew when we were going to go see this, I'm three and before it and it clue it it was like part of me was trying to guess what they would be and one of them would be like, okay, there's going to be some pretty deep in online interactions or they're going to do something like spark ass sport pedias."
2774.56,2775.56, Yeah.
2775.56,2776.56, That kind of thing.
2776.56,2779.56, That actually was surprising that it wasn't a part of it.
2779.56,2782.56," They definitely, that's why there's going to be match for it."
2782.56,2785.56," Well, they did say there was going to be user."
2785.56,2786.56," Yeah, for sure."
2786.56,2798.56," Yeah, user generated content is obviously huge and they told us the hinted that there would be, you know, something like the Sims Exchange where you can put your stuff on a central hub people can write it."
2798.56,2799.56, Right.
2799.56,2803.56, But it's not an open dynamic thing like sport and sport pedia though.
2803.56,2805.56," Yeah. I mean, maybe there's time to add that."
2805.56,2806.56, Maybe they're kind of waiting.
2806.56,2808.56, They were being coy about it.
2808.56,2811.56," So maybe that is like in the cards, maybe if it works out for sports."
2811.56,2813.56, And they have enough time.
2813.56,2814.56, Right.
2814.56,2821.56," I would think that watching Will Wright's game and how that does it just stripped that whole, you know, package of technology from the one and put it good."
2821.56,2822.56, Yes.
2822.56,2823.56, They ready that like with that.
2823.56,2827.56, So that is like character customization options and tiger woods.
2827.56,2829.56, They were then able to loan to some of the other games.
2829.56,2838.56," You know, so that part of the predatory suspects that might be why they were playing coy and why this wasn't a big deal at this time in this game's life cycle, which is still like you said way early."
2838.56,2842.56, It's coming out spring 2009 or something.
2842.56,2843.56, Yeah.
2843.56,2845.56, Did you guys all play the Sims games?
2845.56,2846.56, Yeah.
2846.56,2848.56, Most recent one I played with Sims 2 cast away.
2848.56,2850.56, So you play the expansions?
2850.56,2854.56," Well, the cast away one was actually like for PSP and PS2."
2854.56,2856.56, It's like it's a standalone thing.
2856.56,2860.56, But it's because I got I've got into the Sims 1 a ton.
2860.56,2862.56, Sims 1 I got since two I played.
2862.56,2864.56," Sims 2 a ton, but never."
2864.56,2867.56, I was always done by the time even the first expansion.
2867.56,2868.56," Yeah, I never went into expansion."
2868.56,2872.56, So I like never really experienced what was in those.
2872.56,2881.56, But the thing that I didn't like about them that I think you guys said in your preview that they changed was like a the way you always had to manage like your your cleanliness.
2881.56,2883.56, How hungry you are and all that didn't you guys.
2883.56,2885.56," Yeah, they're really easy or something."
2885.56,2888.56," Yeah, they've got this been some misunderstanding."
2888.56,2894.56, I'm lying from people who read our story that there is no more peeing.
2895.56,2897.56," Like, and that's not true at all."
2897.56,2900.56, What happens is in the last couple of Sims games.
2900.56,2906.56, All your Sims have these very obvious discrete bars that fill up like as they need to pee the bar.
2906.56,2909.56, So you feel up until the blighters fall and then you go to the bathroom bar drain.
2909.56,2912.56, So you're like constantly watching these eight different.
2912.56,2913.56, Like it's like played spinning.
2913.56,2914.56," It's like okay, now right."
2914.56,2917.56," Because the eating, you know, the hunger bars away at the top."
2917.56,2918.56, So you just got to writing.
2918.56,2922.56, You could just get it off the floor and the circle of my topping off the bars.
2922.56,2928.56," Right, so you can spend your entire like game day just like dealing with going to the bathroom and showering."
2928.56,2930.56, And it's really easy to get obsessive control.
2930.56,2933.56, So they're getting rid of.
2933.56,2936.56, They're simplifying it down to three bars.
2936.56,2943.56, The kind of the main one is like fun versus stress and they're dealing with like bladder by keeping keeping
2943.56,2944.56, up behind the curtains.
2944.56,2949.56, So I'm assuming there's still some metric that you don't see that right determines that they're going to have to pee soon.
2949.56,2953.56," But then when it's time to pee, you basically get a buff."
2953.56,2957.56," It's like a suddenly all of a sudden you get a little icon over your sim that says,"
2957.56,2960.56, I need to pee and then until you address that.
2960.56,2964.56," So the difference is like a real person, you're like, oh, I got to take a week and someone who spends the entire day like,"
2964.56,2966.56," Oh, God, I don't have to go pee in four and a half hours."
2966.56,2967.56," Oh, my God, I don't have to go pee in half hours."
2967.56,2968.56," Yeah, I'm still going to have to go pee in half hours."
2968.56,2969.56, Exactly.
2969.56,2972.56," That's the difference, which is a lot more natural than me."
2972.56,2973.56, And this is the most case.
2973.56,2976.56," When I tried, I, the one experience I had was Sims 2."
2976.56,2977.56, I tried on the Xbox.
2978.56,2980.56, As I remember at the time of a bunch of people at EGM weren't worked.
2980.56,2981.56," We're, we're in do it."
2981.56,2983.56, Damien and Jan and stuff.
2983.56,2987.56, And I tried it for like five minutes and it was horrible.
2987.56,2992.56," There's like the character just had to, it was like upset because he had to go to the bathroom or something."
2992.56,2993.56, I'd go to the bathroom and he was still pissed off.
2993.56,2995.56," I mean, like, like, he needs a split sleep."
2995.56,2996.56, So I was sleeping.
2996.56,2997.56, He's still pissed off.
2997.56,2999.56," And I was like, he needs a sleep more."
2999.56,3000.56, And I just kept trying to sleep.
3000.56,3003.56," I was like, by the time he got it from that, he had to go pee again."
3003.56,3004.56," Yeah, eventually he's this."
3004.56,3005.56," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3005.56,3007.56," Yeah, like that shidiest pet."
3007.56,3009.56, It would have been good.
3009.56,3011.56, I think that's what they're trying to get away from this.
3011.56,3013.56, Dark electric pet.
3013.56,3015.56, I hated it.
3015.56,3020.56, I think they're trying to get away from that because they really was the beginning of the game was really about that no matter what.
3020.56,3025.56," I mean, and eventually by going to work and getting a better job, you bought new furniture."
3025.56,3027.56," Yeah, they'll build those things up faster."
3027.56,3030.56, So you get the made so you don't have to clean your house yourself.
3030.56,3034.56, But the beginning was really about the bottom level of the human needs pyramid.
3034.56,3037.56," I was just like, you know, they're not dirty."
3037.56,3038.56, Sleep.
3038.56,3040.56," No, not sleepy."
3040.56,3041.56," Yeah, caveman levels."
3041.56,3047.56," Also they've broken the fourth wall a little bit with some of the stuff, like especially like with the cleanliness."
3047.56,3050.56, I guess they debated it for a long time.
3050.56,3057.56," And as you can read in our story, they stumble upon this sort of by accident accident of a design."
3057.56,3059.56," But this notion that, you know,"
3060.56,3067.56," if their house is a mess and their the type who's whining about the mess, when they're off doing something, you,"
3067.56,3071.56, the player can actually clean up their house themselves.
3071.56,3072.56, That the elves.
3072.56,3074.56," Yeah, they can be the magic elf."
3074.56,3077.56, So that so it's clean for them when they get back.
3077.56,3082.56," Yeah, which before they never wanted to do that, they never wanted to have that kind of hand of God in here."
3082.56,3088.56, But then they discovered through an accident and through play testing that people were like kind of glad they could just do that now.
3088.56,3097.56, I would intentionally and like the Sims 2 make sure all of my Sims had their neatness category just all the way down because otherwise it's actually freaked out by a dish.
3097.56,3102.56," And they just said to like, and it takes them longer to put a dish in the sink."
3102.56,3106.56, And it does to do any other task in human history because the path finding was just so bad.
3106.56,3107.56, There's been a right.
3107.56,3109.56, It sounds like it takes like two hours of like human time.
3109.56,3110.56, Right.
3110.56,3115.56," So they actually talked about how the fact that that system that they had in the old it, those sliders."
3115.56,3121.56, Basically forced you into picking a mid ground so that your sim wanted to be too high maintenance.
3121.56,3125.56," It's like Sean saying if you hadn't been neat, he was just going to be a fucking pain in the ass."
3125.56,3131.56," He's going to be like the ultimate Felix, younger sort of whiny, you know, well sorry, that was an odd couple of reference."
3131.56,3132.56, You're guys are doing that.
3132.56,3133.56, I got it.
3133.56,3134.56, Okay.
3134.56,3136.56," Sean's like, whole."
3136.56,3138.56," Walter Mathau, Jack Lemon."
3138.56,3139.56, That was the movie.
3139.56,3140.56, Yeah.
3140.56,3142.56, We talked about Walter Mathau.
3143.56,3144.56," Hey, we're talking about the story."
3144.56,3146.56, You talked about someone as older or two.
3146.56,3147.56, Yeah.
3147.56,3148.56, Yeah.
3148.56,3149.56, I'm talking about the movie.
3149.56,3150.56, Yeah.
3150.56,3151.56, So yeah.
3151.56,3152.56, Let's introduce ourselves.
3152.56,3153.56, Right.
3153.56,3157.56," So that, you know, now they're saying you can be those extreme."
3157.56,3159.56, You could be an extreme of one sort or another.
3159.56,3161.56, And the game can still work for you.
3161.56,3162.56, Yeah.
3162.56,3164.56, I like the trajectory that they're taking.
3164.56,3171.56, Like because that rudimentary game we're just we're talking about where you basically have this organism that has to be in a house.
3171.56,3174.56, And it has to be in a house to sleep and it likes to be clean.
3174.56,3176.56," It's like, I mean, that's like the dullest part."
3176.56,3187.56," If you're looking at a game where you could potentially in the future when you're when you're focusing on, you know, interpersonal relationships and just like how people influence one another, how they get their way."
3187.56,3196.56," What, you know, larger goals in life than, you know, I'm saying, like, certainly those those things were clear in the first couple of Sims."
3196.56,3200.56," But, but yeah, it was kind of, you could get overwhelmed by those fundamental needs."
3200.56,3212.56," I mean, but I think given the restrictions that, you know, that there were at the time on an AI and other things, I mean, they did a pretty good job of, you know, quote unquote, people, people simulated."
3212.56,3219.56," I would always in my household like if I had like two people who I was like, this is the, this is the people, this is the couple I want to make."
3219.56,3220.56, I want to do these guys.
3220.56,3226.56, I would inevitably make a third person who is just basically a housekeeper deal with all the other shit.
3226.56,3227.56, Yeah.
3227.56,3229.56, Right. And also basically make a made.
3229.56,3239.56," And just, because count the, you know, the quote unquote emergent gameplay that came out of the Sims, I mean, you know, so much of the fun was just like fucking with these people, you know, like, you know,"
3239.56,3247.56," you know, walling them in, you know, the torture angle, right, you know, that that kind of stuff was a huge part of the, I didn't go in the pool and pull in the ladder out right."
3247.56,3251.56, Watch him drive just to share the shared torture element has always been fun.
3251.56,3252.56, So.
3252.56,3253.56, True.
3253.56,3256.56," And I don't think that they're getting away from that, right?"
3256.56,3257.56, I don't think so.
3257.56,3258.56, Yeah.
3258.56,3260.56, I can't kill hookers though.
3260.56,3266.56," No Ryan, you can't kill hookers. You'll have to find another game for that particular per person of your business."
3266.56,3274.56," Do they make any use of like the internet is a theme or like, you know, blackberries and just, you know, modern telecommunications."
3274.56,3280.56, I didn't see any actually in the new in the new expansion free time for Sims 2.
3280.56,3287.56," They added that kind of stuff like if you, I didn't, I don't think this, I'm actually addressing your question, but they did add the existence of the"
3287.56,3296.56," existence of that just in terms of like if you get into a particular hobby, you know, if you become whatever a book nerd,"
3296.56,3306.56," comma book nerd at some point in your leveling up of this hobby of yours, you will get the ability to blog about comic books."
3306.56,3312.56," This is why I like I'm thinking of after I played four more, which is this game and I was, I was talking about it."
3312.56,3322.56," I don't want to be yours, but it's got all this potential and that it's basically operates as, as a top to bottom simulation of like internet use."
3322.56,3329.56," So there's fake, it's that messengers in the game, there's fake email accounts, there's, you know, spam sites, forums and all this stuff."
3329.56,3337.56," And when you're playing it, it's all flash and it's like it's easy to believe though that you're in some alternate reality version of the internet where these things can happen."
3337.56,3347.56," And it that just seems like that idea, they're on this something even if four more is itself right now isn't like all that it can be like to take that idea and you could just throw it in the other games."
3347.56,3350.56," Well, that's kind of what that entire package, majestic."
3350.56,3362.56," What that was called that EA game that aborted to an even greater extent that way, they would actually, they would email your real email account and they might leave you might get messengers on your list."
3362.56,3370.56," Yeah, right, right, there's a lot of potential that that kind of is like the what what you know with arcs alternate reality gaming."
3370.56,3380.56," It's sort of went in that direction, but even like this like the the four more thing, I mean, like if you put that whole thing because now it's like you're going to have same as you have some like modern life thing like you got to have."
3380.56,3386.56, The internet and it like if they could basically just rip that whole interface rip it right off of the other and put it in there and then you could like.
3386.56,3388.56, Send messages to your neighbor and stuff.
3388.56,3390.56," If that's in there, they didn't touch on it."
3390.56,3392.56, I doubt it. I smell expansion pack.
3392.56,3396.56," I mean, that's a thing is they can that kind of thing if people are just like clamoring for it."
3396.56,3398.56," Yeah, cram it in there."
3398.56,3403.56," That's what they do and there will be expansion pack. Oh, yes, guarantee it because like they didn't show."
3403.56,3408.56, Then show if they're pets in it and that's like the default second expansion pack almost every time it's like.
3408.56,3411.56, Dogs and cats now you have dogs and cats to sure.
3411.56,3415.56, Didn't that David Fincher movie the game come out around the time that majestic did?
3415.56,3417.56," Yeah, that predated majestic."
3417.56,3419.56," Yeah, it's the same sentiment. Same."
3419.56,3421.56, That movie was ridiculous man.
3421.56,3423.56, Like that you did.
3423.56,3425.56," Yeah, I was along with the theme was over."
3425.56,3428.56," It reminded me of Metal Gear Solid II where you're like, okay, there's a twist."
3428.56,3429.56, This is cool and fall.
3429.56,3431.56, Here's the then we're going to double back on that twist.
3431.56,3432.56, Yeah.
3432.56,3435.56," And then there's a triple twist and a quadruped twist and then at the end I'm like, you know what?"
3435.56,3437.56, I don't fucking care if this is a gamer real.
3437.56,3438.56," Well, so I think that's it."
3438.56,3440.56," But yeah, I mean, sure."
3440.56,3442.56, There were like eight twist too many.
3442.56,3444.56, There are about a lot of the twist movie.
3444.56,3445.56," Yeah, yeah, that whole movie."
3445.56,3449.56," That came out, but I'm sure that the consumer that he was a fan of that movie."
3449.56,3455.56," Because it came out like I remember like, oh, yeah, so it's all in just two and I remember when I got that I was like, oh, god, here we go again."
3455.56,3457.56," I did really, really own just."
3457.56,3461.56, I like the concept of majestic.
3461.56,3466.56," It didn't deliver, but but there were some really cool things about it."
3466.56,3471.56," I mean, how intrusive was it? Like, did you have to you had to opt into the intrusive?"
3471.56,3472.56," Yeah, it was the thing."
3472.56,3478.56," You know, at the time that you installed the game, it would say like, do you want us to call your phone?"
3478.56,3481.56," You know, do you want to get faxes? Do you want to get emails?"
3481.56,3485.56, You could opt in for any or all of them or opt out completely.
3485.56,3487.56, So it was totally your call.
3487.56,3493.56," That was the last attempt at that kind of a game outside of like, you know, the the arts that I was talking about."
3493.56,3497.56," That's far as I know, especially, especially from a mainstream company."
3497.56,3499.56," Yeah, there's nothing better than that scale and scope."
3499.56,3502.56," Like, they should do it again, like you would lost or something, you know, I mean,"
3502.56,3505.56," they were missing. Oh, missing did that too. That's right."
3505.56,3508.56, Missing was an adventure game. Did it call you and everything though?
3508.56,3509.56, I think it emails.
3509.56,3514.56," Yeah, they sent you emails and they, but mostly it was using the web, like you would you would do searches"
3514.56,3517.56, and things like that that used real sites or what they were sites.
3517.56,3521.56, They looked real on those. You felt like that's what you were doing.
3521.56,3524.56," Like, it seems like there's a ton of on the potential there."
3524.56,3526.56," Yeah, the problem with majestic."
3526.56,3527.56, I think it was tanked.
3527.56,3532.56," Yeah, they couldn't fake it and not I mean, they couldn't like you don't always know."
3532.56,3535.56, So it wasn't as ominous as you would kind of want it to be.
3535.56,3538.56," Well, that's the catch 22 of the thing. In order to be like, fully,"
3538.56,3541.56," hit this word immersed into it, like you do want to be interrupted."
3541.56,3543.56, You want it to be like the three in the morning to the right.
3543.56,3545.56," Yeah, you would want message."
3545.56,3548.56," Yeah, but if you're like, don't don't wake me up."
3548.56,3552.56, Like you can opt into like the deluxe like collectors edition.
3552.56,3555.56, Like you sent someone to knock on your door for a.
3555.56,3559.56," Yeah, and then they have to be like there has to be some like you like this game."
3559.56,3562.56," How about if we break your fucking arm, maybe with the second."
3562.56,3563.56, I'm thinking more day than much.
3563.56,3566.56, I want like a major with the sex of a red cape to show up.
3566.56,3567.56, Do a little bit.
3567.56,3569.56," Hello, just green."
3569.56,3571.56, Yeah.
3571.56,3575.56," Yeah, the ability to opt in just kind of kill some of the edge."
3575.56,3579.56," Yeah, but I just think most people will be scared of that for legal reasons too."
3579.56,3582.56," I don't know, it just seems like there'd be a lot of very brown there."
3582.56,3586.56," I mean, if you signed a very complicated waiver before you began your game,"
3586.56,3590.56," that just said like, you know, if you receive a call and you have a heart attack."
3590.56,3592.56, It's not our fault.
3592.56,3595.56," But yeah, I mean, being followed by invisible men, life's good."
3595.56,3597.56, One of my so miserable then.
3597.56,3598.56," I mean, that was a problem."
3598.56,3603.56, I had somebody else like we could sign Ryan up for majestic and not tell him.
3603.56,3605.56, It's your birthday present.
3605.56,3606.56, Right.
3606.56,3609.56, That's the that takes back to the whole day of the venture thing.
3609.56,3610.56, Exactly.
3610.56,3611.56, Yeah.
3611.56,3613.56, That's the same problem.
3613.56,3615.56, I have with the freaking Temo got cheese.
3615.56,3620.56," Oh, because you're like, if you didn't address its needs, like right when you"
3620.56,3623.56," needed it, like at the foreign the morning and for a week when those first things"
3623.56,3625.56," came out, I was obsessed with the idea of it."
3625.56,3629.56," And I know right now, I'm just like, why am I telling anyone this, but"
3629.56,3633.56," like, I would get up at foreign the morning if it beeped and needed."
3633.56,3634.56, It's poop cleaned up.
3634.56,3635.56," Oh, did."
3635.56,3636.56, For like a whole week of my life.
3636.56,3639.56," And then like there was a moment or just like, Oh, what the fuck is"
3639.56,3642.56," going on with the things you see like on the internet and just like,"
3642.56,3643.56, you just close it.
3643.56,3644.56, Uh-huh.
3644.56,3645.56, And that's it.
3645.56,3646.56, You don't think about it.
3646.56,3648.56, When the fuck do you ever see something on the internet?
3648.56,3649.56, Didn't I tell you clothes?
3649.56,3650.56, Yeah.
3650.56,3651.56, What do you see?
3651.56,3652.56, All the time.
3652.56,3654.56," When did we have this whole, it's the usual thing."
3654.56,3659.56," It's actually sad because it's a version of Rick Rolling, which is the dumbest thing ever."
3659.56,3663.56, Rick Rolling is just this dumb YouTube music video of a tool name Rick
3663.56,3667.56, Rolling and a shitty song and you would just change like the URL or whatever
3667.56,3668.56, and trick people into clicking it.
3668.56,3671.56," You got re-grilled, but our version is did basically."
3671.56,3676.56," It's always something, it's always some different surprise, but you tell someone it's something else."
3676.56,3679.56," So invent, you could put your comment in there and you say like,"
3679.56,3682.56," Holy shit dude, the new screen came out for whatever."
3682.56,3683.56, You'd be out of three of us now.
3683.56,3684.56, It's something more believable.
3684.56,3685.56, Yeah.
3685.56,3687.56," You know, or more for us, it's more like, you know,"
3687.56,3689.56, Demoingus X is a YouTube superstar.
3689.56,3690.56," Well, but I call you shit."
3690.56,3692.56, Demoingus X posted a picture of his new girlfriend.
3692.56,3695.56, So then people go and click and then they hit the surprise.
3695.56,3696.56, Yeah.
3696.56,3697.56, This was why I don't click your links.
3697.56,3700.56," You click your Amy and it'd be like, hey, click this."
3700.56,3702.56, It's like something and then I'll click it.
3702.56,3704.56, It's like someone with a penis.
3704.56,3706.56, You shouldn't shoot that one.
3706.56,3707.56, You shouldn't.
3707.56,3709.56, People don't understand the lot of this stuff.
3709.56,3710.56, Like the big dog.
3710.56,3713.56," It wasn't like, it's like a, it's a her mouth for a day."
3713.56,3716.56," It's like, it's the fact that that's immaterial."
3716.56,3721.56, It was the big dog from the shirt.
3721.56,3723.56, It's like a line of clothing for like the piece.
3723.56,3726.56, People that want to feel like good about being obese.
3726.56,3730.56," So, but the big dog, he's like, where am I supposed to settle?"
3730.56,3733.56, He's wearing like gray bands and he's always got this look on his face.
3733.56,3735.56," Like, you know what I mean?"
3735.56,3738.56," It's like just this knowing look, but reflected in the sunglasses."
3738.56,3740.56, Was it her mapper and I laid out on a car from that.
3740.56,3744.56," Like if there was like a place where you could have like,"
3744.56,3748.56," Budweiser commercials, but for her, her mapper did a audience or, or, or, or, or, or, or,"
3748.56,3749.56, Connoisseurs of such.
3749.56,3753.56," And so that the joke wasn't that dude, the trick with the dick,"
3753.56,3755.56," but it was like, that the big dog."
3755.56,3758.56, This got this badass like look like I see that.
3758.56,3760.56, You didn't pick up on that joke?
3760.56,3764.56," I posted that shit before people, there's something, what the fuck."
3764.56,3766.56," But it like, there's a whole thing."
3766.56,3767.56," That, that came from something awful."
3767.56,3771.56," And they have this like, there's this thread where people made so many awesome fake big dog shirts."
3771.56,3775.56," And it would be like, the big dog with this tough ass look on his face."
3775.56,3780.56," And it would say, I don't know, like, don't, don't touch my, don't touch my manga dead."
3780.56,3782.56," Or, I don't know if stuff like this."
3782.56,3784.56," It's pronounced manga, you know, I mean, just ridiculous."
3784.56,3792.56," Like, the weirdest like juxtaposition of a supposedly tough dog, DAWG, nerdy is commentary."
3792.56,3794.56, So that's where it went.
3794.56,3797.56," Oh, we did get good mileage out of that picture though, the big dog thing."
3797.56,3803.56," On the, on the relic forums, um, for company heroes, there's this weird thing where everyone wants to all."
3803.56,3804.56, There's a user.
3804.56,3811.56," And he's got some ridiculous, uh, like, overmanged the Nazi Superman avatar or something."
3811.56,3816.56," And you, when you're in that game, we know someone joins the game and they're like SS,"
3816.56,3817.56, Thirm fear or something.
3817.56,3820.56," Thirm immediately like, how can we fuck with this person?"
3820.56,3822.56, But they're on the forums posting that.
3822.56,3826.56," And this guy had the most like, it was basically just like this really home,"
3826.56,3829.56," more roti image of a Nazi Superman just decked out in swastika and stuff like,"
3829.56,3831.56," where did this even come from, right?"
3831.56,3835.56," So we made Rory response to the guy was he quoted him,"
3835.56,3839.56, but then he took his avatar and then he put that in the glasses of the big dog.
3839.56,3842.56," We're like, we're like, we posted that."
3842.56,3844.56, And he got banned for it or something.
3844.56,3847.56," But like, no one had already had what it meant, you know,"
3847.56,3849.56," it was just like, I see what you're up to, dude."
3849.56,3850.56, All this stuff.
3850.56,3852.56, The big dog and I know what's going on here.
3852.56,3855.56," All of us in general got a really bad problem of picking on people,"
3855.56,3857.56, like the second they come in like that.
3857.56,3859.56, But that's what I'll think with one consciousness now.
3859.56,3862.56," But that's not just like, again, people like wanted like,"
3862.56,3863.56," shout, bullyism or nothing."
3863.56,3864.56, It's nothing of the sort.
3864.56,3866.56," Like, if you, if you're calling yourself like,"
3866.56,3868.56," they come in there and they're like,"
3868.56,3870.56," gering and gering and stuff, like,"
3870.56,3871.56, I don't know.
3871.56,3872.56, I think it's fair to pick on you.
3872.56,3874.56, That's not being a bull.
3874.56,3876.56," Your name, look what you're fucking doing."
3876.56,3877.56, Look what you're up to.
3877.56,3880.56, So they're having yourself after fucking Nazis.
3880.56,3882.56," Like, I'm gonna, like, if you're gonna do that,"
3882.56,3884.56, then you gotta be down to be clowned on.
3884.56,3886.56, You gotta down with the clown.
3886.56,3887.56, Yeah.
3887.56,3888.56," Well, I think if you're gonna play online in general,"
3888.56,3890.56, you gotta be willing to be clowned.
3890.56,3893.56," Well, company here isn't as far as what I've seen has one of the more like,"
3893.56,3898.56," crazy racist, like, group of players I've ever seen."
3898.56,3901.56," Like when we go in the chat channel and everyone's like,"
3901.56,3903.56, saying shit that I want to use that.
3903.56,3905.56," I mean, but is it that the true, it's true."
3905.56,3908.56," Everything, but the same time I ever played Xbox,"
3908.56,3910.56, but they love Xbox politics.
3910.56,3911.56, They love it.
3911.56,3912.56," Yeah, it's different."
3912.56,3915.56," In Xbox live, it's like, you know, the words will come up."
3915.56,3917.56," It's like, this and that, but there's like,"
3917.56,3918.56," these people, the game and play,"
3918.56,3920.56, they're in a chat channel in particular.
3920.56,3922.56," And every time you go in there,"
3922.56,3926.56, they say the game is a debate about politics or something that devolves into what you think.
3926.56,3928.56," So it's like you go in there and just discuss about,"
3928.56,3930.56," broughty, pama, pama, pama, pama, pama."
3930.56,3931.56," Yeah, and that's going in there."
3931.56,3933.56," And that's when people are young like diaper head, like,"
3933.56,3934.56, DIPR.
3934.56,3936.56, And there's just all this back and forth.
3936.56,3940.56," And then the, then the real hate terms come out and they're all caps and"
3940.56,3942.56," and people just, it doesn't how everything."
3942.56,3943.56, Something that I don't play online.
3943.56,3946.56," The other thing, there's an international audience of players."
3946.56,3948.56," So you get like euros,"
3948.56,3952.56," and like people from Singapore and all these in South America all right,"
3952.56,3954.56, arguing with each other.
3954.56,3958.56, And so what happens a lot at a world image of America and then American self image
3958.56,3964.56," are often like, confronting one another in this form of all places."
3964.56,3965.56, Yeah.
3965.56,3968.56," It doesn't help if it's certain members of our group that show or main a name,"
3968.56,3970.56, egg them on sometimes.
3970.56,3971.56, And then you regret it.
3971.56,3972.56, Or who that could be.
3972.56,3975.56," You guys say like, they're like, yeah, I heard Barak,"
3975.56,3978.56," who's saying Osama is a Muslim, but the spelling."
3978.56,3979.56, The most.
3979.56,3980.56, The most.
3980.56,3981.56, I'm a person.
3981.56,3983.56," Well, that's actually a proper older."
3983.56,3984.56," So I mean, it's Belly."
3984.56,3985.56," So I was like, right."
3985.56,3986.56, Right.
3986.56,3987.56, M-O-S.
3987.56,3988.56, L-O-M.
3988.56,3989.56, Yeah.
3989.56,3990.56, It didn't.
3990.56,3993.56," They were like trying to correct you, but then they're spelling was all wrong."
3993.56,3995.56," And then like, yeah, the whole point you're like, okay,"
3995.56,3998.56, I'm going to do this just to show them how dumb this whole thing isn't
3998.56,3999.56, but then they get in with it.
3999.56,4001.56," They're like, yeah, you got to get point."
4001.56,4002.56, Yeah.
4002.56,4003.56, I'm going to regret it.
4003.56,4004.56, Yeah.
4005.56,4006.56," Say, well, we're talking internet."
4006.56,4007.56, Yeah.
4007.56,4010.56," About that, we're going to play the Relate Guys"
4010.56,4011.56, at their own game.
4011.56,4012.56, Right.
4012.56,4013.56," Because they're cheating, right?"
4013.56,4014.56, I heard.
4014.56,4017.56," Well, they even asking and asking for this game to happen."
4017.56,4019.56," And it's always like, yeah, we're, you know, it happened."
4019.56,4020.56, We'll get around to it.
4020.56,4023.56," But now they tell us that, you know, we'll do it this Thursday."
4023.56,4028.56," However, they're releasing a major patch with today."
4028.56,4031.56, Balance with significant balance changes today.
4031.56,4032.56, What a coincidence.
4032.56,4033.56, And now they're ready to play.
4033.56,4038.56," Yeah, giving us giving us like whatever a day and a half or, you know, an evening and even"
4038.56,4039.56," yeah, thanks for coming."
4039.56,4040.56, Thanks for coming.
4040.56,4042.56, So prepare.
4042.56,4043.56, Uh-huh.
4043.56,4045.56," So we'll have to, um, the plan is to..."
4045.56,4048.56, They delayed this patch on purpose.
4048.56,4050.56, Just to get us to fuck with us.
4050.56,4051.56, Yeah.
4051.56,4053.56, Just to say you lose as much.
4053.56,4055.56," Honestly, don't call on you out, Relate."
4055.56,4056.56, I just don't picture us losing.
4056.56,4058.56," Like, I just don't think we don't say that."
4058.56,4059.56, That's it.
4059.56,4060.56, And fuck that.
4060.56,4061.56, I'm not sure.
4061.56,4063.56, I learned the hard way about that.
4063.56,4067.56," You never, if you're ever going to go into any kind of competition, don't go talk to"
4067.56,4068.56, Chip.
4068.56,4069.56, I'm not trying to get a lose.
4069.56,4070.56, I'm just saying that you're going to lose.
4070.56,4071.56, I'm just saying that you're going to lose.
4071.56,4072.56, I'm just saying that you're going to lose.
4072.56,4073.56, We always win.
4073.56,4075.56," That happens a lot in games, but you got to keep in mind."
4075.56,4077.56, We're playing Relate.
4077.56,4079.56, The differences we're not playing.
4079.56,4080.56, We're not playing.
4080.56,4082.56, We're not playing their balance team.
4082.56,4084.56, At least I don't want to.
4084.56,4087.56," And the thing there is that the balance team, it's their job to play."
4087.56,4090.56, That game nine to five.
4090.56,4095.56," And to find and to try everything that you can exploit, get to search for everything that"
4095.56,4097.5599999999995, might be overpowered.
4097.5599999999995,4099.5599999999995," That is like, I don't know."
4099.5599999999995,4104.5599999999995," If you thought you were cool because you boxed amateur like downtown, and then you went up,"
4104.5599999999995,4107.5599999999995, you start talking shit on the World Heavyweight.
4107.5599999999995,4110.5599999999995, That's pretty much what you're dealing with.
4110.5599999999995,4113.5599999999995," But maybe what when maybe we won't, I don't know."
4113.5599999999995,4115.5599999999995, We have to get used to the game.
4115.56,4118.56," And it is the other thing is it's going to, it's bad for us."
4118.56,4121.56, We can't win because it's going to sound like excuse making.
4121.56,4124.56," If we're like, oh, God, we got burned by some of the patch changes."
4124.56,4128.56," Because if you don't, well, people who play the game will understand that this is this stuff"
4128.56,4132.56," really matters, but people who don't, it's like, yeah, whatever."
4132.56,4133.56," You just lost it, it made it."
4133.56,4137.56," And of course, you know, that's that's that will be how it is."
4137.56,4140.56," Of course, if you win, it will be that much more triumphant."
4140.56,4141.56," Yeah, so it should be fine."
4141.56,4143.56," Well, here's why I was bringing up a work and a put up."
4143.56,4147.56," Well, host, the replay files of people that own the game can just watch it in this entirety."
4147.56,4152.56," And then I think we plan on making like, you know, like a highlight real for game videos and put that up."
4152.56,4153.56, There was some kind of Harry cool.
4153.56,4157.56," If we're lucky, we'll record us in team speak, but we can't tell like,"
4157.56,4160.56, Rory and Matt that we're a taping him so we can get them going on.
4160.56,4161.56, Having a lot of a newism.
4161.56,4164.56, But all their blue talk will get in there.
4164.56,4166.56, Kim's if David's put that on.
4166.56,4168.56," Oh, I'm sure you just market adults."
4168.56,4171.56," Oh, and then that's how we click any video on the internet."
4171.56,4172.56," Yeah, how old are you?"
4172.56,4173.56, When were you born?
4173.56,4174.56, I know one.
4174.56,4175.56, Yeah.
4175.56,4176.56, It's the first one.
4176.56,4177.56, The first one.
4177.56,4178.56, Yeah.
4178.56,4180.56, I was going to ask you guys this question and glide you are.
4180.56,4181.56, Mind me of that.
4181.56,4184.56," When you get confining with that screen, I was born in."
4184.56,4185.56, Do you tell the truth?
4185.56,4186.56," No, why would you?"
4186.56,4188.56, Most of the time that's it's extra effort.
4188.56,4189.56, I do.
4189.56,4190.56, And I don't know why.
4190.56,4191.56, You go to your data bar.
4191.56,4192.56, I go to the actual year.
4192.56,4193.56, Yes.
4193.56,4194.56, What I know.
4194.56,4195.56, I can't help.
4195.56,4196.56, It's a big day in month.
4196.56,4197.56, That too.
4197.56,4198.56, I do that.
4198.56,4199.56, The metrics for the site.
4199.56,4202.56, The key demographic of users are all like January.
4202.56,4205.56, I know there's a 145 year old.
4205.56,4208.56, A lot of new years before these six years.
4208.56,4209.56, Everyone's born on January 1st.
4209.56,4210.56," Yeah, I don't know."
4210.56,4214.56," January 1st, 1900 or usually it's like 1901 is when the thing starts."
4214.56,4216.56, So that's when I was born.
4216.56,4219.56," Or if it's just age, it's like 99."
4219.56,4221.56, Age gates are just a bit with the scroll wheel down.
4221.56,4222.56, Whatever it lands on past.
4222.56,4225.56," Well, it might as to be a lie-billed thing."
4225.56,4226.56," Yeah, that's what it is."
4226.56,4230.56," For some reason, it gets you out of bad situations to put an age gate."
4230.56,4231.56, Right.
4231.56,4232.56, They got in trouble.
4232.56,4233.56, Some points.
4233.56,4236.56, They didn't have an age gate on some of the gears of war stuff or something like that.
4236.56,4238.56," It's a dude at 711 Son, you pack smokes in."
4238.56,4239.56, And they owe you these smokes.
4239.56,4241.56," Yeah, and they have no better way to police it."
4241.56,4243.56, That's like what they have right now.
4243.56,4244.56, So until there is.
4244.56,4245.56, What else would they do?
4245.56,4246.56, Feet chips.
4246.56,4247.56, We're talking about.
4247.56,4248.56, Yeah.
4248.56,4249.56, The cookie bar is just canned.
4249.56,4250.56, I'm glad that's all it is.
4250.56,4251.56, Yeah.
4251.56,4252.56, I'm glad I knew.
4252.56,4254.56, Extra step.
4254.56,4255.56, I guess I mean.
4256.56,4259.56, I guess if you're too and don't understand what you're about to pull the gun.
4259.56,4262.56, I don't know who's supposed to stop though.
4262.56,4263.56, Right.
4263.56,4264.56, Stopped.
4264.56,4265.56, Right.
4265.56,4267.56," Very, very, very honest kids."
4267.56,4269.56, That's not stopped me.
4269.56,4271.56, That's in stops.
4271.56,4272.56, Here we go.
4272.56,4275.56, Nothing stops you for speculating on lost.
4275.56,4276.56, Hey.
4276.56,4277.56," Oh, God."
4277.56,4279.56, We're not doing loss speculation.
4279.56,4280.56, Are we?
4280.56,4281.56," No, they wanted to segue."
4281.56,4282.56, Yeah.
4282.56,4283.56, We're really doing loss speculation.
4283.56,4284.56," Well, it has a come to that."
4284.56,4285.56, Right.
4285.56,4286.56, We got some thought.
4286.56,4287.56, Okay.
4287.56,4288.56," Oh, you have a theory."
4288.56,4289.56, Maybe.
4289.56,4290.56, Are we talking about loss now?
4290.56,4292.56, We're getting our off topic stuff already.
4292.56,4294.56, Do we have more on topic stuff?
4294.56,4297.56," Well, I don't know if you have you've been playing anything else new."
4297.56,4298.56, Either you guys are right.
4298.56,4299.56, We could talk about.
4299.56,4300.56, I'm playing fall at one penny.
4300.56,4301.56," Here was like, fiends."
4301.56,4303.56, You want to hear about it.
4303.56,4304.56, We have a wrong podcast.
4304.56,4307.56, We definitely need to break down our strategies.
4307.56,4308.56, Like we have.
4308.56,4309.56, Maybe I'll just wait.
4309.56,4310.56," You're, we're appetite."
4310.56,4311.56, I thought we were going to talk about what they are.
4311.56,4312.56," But like, let's go."
4312.56,4314.56, We've got to say the operation bang bus.
4314.56,4315.56, We've got obiesious mud.
4315.56,4316.56, But what?
4316.56,4318.56, Obiesious mud but.
4318.56,4319.56, Yeah.
4319.56,4320.56, It's funny too.
4320.56,4321.56, To the names of strategies.
4321.56,4323.56," Yeah, because when we see people doing it, that's how we refer to it too."
4323.56,4325.56," We're like, oh, shitties are all in the bang bus."
4325.56,4327.56, And everyone knows what we're talking about.
4327.56,4330.56, And they make surprising sense too.
4330.56,4331.56, Before I'm going to be.
4331.56,4332.56, I'm not fine.
4332.56,4333.56, Obiesious mud but then.
4333.56,4335.56," But like, okay, let's start the bang bus."
4335.56,4336.56, We'll quick.
4336.56,4337.56, The briths.
4337.56,4338.56, HQs are mobile.
4338.56,4339.56, They're just these big trucks.
4339.56,4340.56, Bus like trucks.
4340.56,4341.56," And they get, they get cruising."
4341.56,4342.56, And you can power them up.
4342.56,4344.56," Well, like, one upgrade is like, he speed governor."
4344.56,4346.56, So they drive faster.
4346.56,4351.56," And when you see one of those crews, one tactic is at the beginning of the match to pull up"
4351.56,4357.56, stakes on the bang bus and to get it up in the front of the good on a good resource point.
4357.56,4360.56," But because when you get up there, then you retreat your troops so that they chase"
4360.56,4362.56, it and then they're able to go faster than they ever did.
4362.56,4365.56," And then when you fight, the enemies racing to get there."
4365.56,4367.56, But you can reinforce from the bang bus.
4367.56,4370.56, So it's just a bang bus because it's a boss and it's banging.
4370.56,4371.56, Okay.
4371.56,4376.56," But um, a piece of mud but it's a classic pinch attack that we're on a TV2."
4376.56,4383.56, Each one of us plays the role of one of Obesia's the mythical Obeswoman's
4383.56,4385.56, Glutius Maximus.
4385.56,4386.56, Yeah.
4386.56,4387.56, That's where you show them.
4387.56,4390.56," So we smash the, yeah, we smash one that we pick out."
4390.56,4392.56, We pick one of the enemies and divide.
4392.56,4394.56, It's basically a picture of a divine carnivore thing.
4394.56,4396.56, We get them in between the cheeks of Obesia.
4396.56,4398.56," But then in the game, you can retreat."
4398.56,4401.56, So we get them mashed up in there and then they're like stuck.
4401.56,4403.56, And sometimes it might be like a muddy level.
4403.56,4405.56, Can we've been doing it in a linden down in the box?
4405.56,4409.56," And then they like, and then when they freak out, then they're retreat."
4409.56,4412.56, You'll just see all their troops go flowing out from between the two.
4412.56,4418.56, Sometimes there might be a tanker of vehicle and then that's like a larger piece of
4418.56,4419.56, matter.
4419.56,4420.56, Oh my God.
4420.56,4423.56, This just makes me not want to play.
4423.56,4427.56, It should be known that Shons come up with every single one of these names.
4427.56,4432.56," Some of Obvious, like if we have like a bunch of tetrax and we're using those as on the"
4432.56,4434.56," offensive rush, then that's the tent offensive."
4434.56,4436.56," I mean, they're fun names."
4436.56,4440.56, Everyone who tuned in because they heard there was Sims talk is now regretting the decision.
4440.56,4442.56, They're learning how to play.
4442.56,4443.56, They co-though.
4443.56,4444.56, That's true.
4444.56,4445.56," So what about, well, how's fall out?"
4445.56,4446.56, Much fun.
4446.56,4447.56, The Sims.
4447.56,4449.56," Well, I first of all, I was amazed with it."
4449.56,4453.56," It actually installed because I'd heard that, you know, because this game goes back to"
4453.56,4455.56, DOS when 95 era.
4455.56,4456.56, Fall out one.
4456.56,4457.56, Fall out one.
4457.56,4461.56," Yeah, I found the desk and I installed it again because of fall three obviously."
4461.56,4464.56, I just wanted to kind of remind myself.
4464.56,4469.56, But it installed and booted up just fine with no worries.
4469.56,4472.56, So it's happy about that.
4472.56,4477.56," But gameplay wise, I just, you know, this is it is one of my favorite opportunities"
4477.56,4481.56," of all time, but we have come a long way in 10 years."
4481.56,4482.56, And it's hard.
4482.56,4487.56," I want to say it's hard to go back, but it's just because I am enjoying it, but I don't"
4487.56,4489.56, think it would ever fly now.
4489.56,4491.56, That was the first thing that I noticed.
4491.56,4495.56," What about it, you know, like just the graphics or well, the graphics are one thing."
4495.56,4500.56," I mean, and they are, you know, pretty rudimentary for, well, I mean, obviously, what"
4500.56,4501.56, we're used to now.
4501.56,4505.56," I mean, it's 640 by 480 and it's it's unchanging."
4505.56,4507.56," You know, you can't do anything."
4507.56,4509.56, You can't do anything with the camera at all.
4509.56,4512.160000000001," I mean, there's all that, but that's just a very superficial thing."
4512.160000000001,4520.160000000001," But just in terms of the gameplay, it really goes back to a time when there was not much"
4520.160000000001,4522.280000000001, handholding going on at all.
4522.280000000001,4525.88, You were just expected to kind of learn by playing in the old days.
4525.88,4528.240000000001," I mean, that's the thing that is striking me the most."
4528.240000000001,4529.88, Only a few hours into it.
4529.88,4533.64," Again, and I played it all the way through twice when it first came out."
4533.64,4535.8, So I know how much more I have to go.
4535.8,4540.56, But there's a lot here that is just like assumed gamer knowledge.
4540.56,4545.6," I mean, the only concession there is is that, you know, the first little stretch out of your"
4545.6,4549.8," out of the, out of vault 13, you're killing a bunch of rats."
4549.8,4551.92, But even that doesn't last for very long.
4551.92,4555.76," And even that, then don't really actually tell you what to do."
4555.76,4561.24," You know, you kind of either have had to have read the manual or just kind of figured out"
4561.24,4563.24, on your own.
4563.24,4564.24, And that's a cool.
4564.5599999999995,4566.28," I mean, that's like a good thing in someone's."
4566.28,4567.28, I am saying it's a good thing.
4567.28,4568.5599999999995, I'm not saying it's bad.
4568.5599999999995,4569.5599999999995, Yeah.
4569.5599999999995,4570.92, I'm saying that this is a good thing.
4570.92,4576.96," It reminded me of the time when when the developers trusted that you could just, that you"
4576.96,4578.44, would get into this on your own.
4578.44,4580.4, They assumed a certain level of intelligence.
4580.4,4581.4, Right.
4581.4,4585.24," I mean, figuring it out on your own, like embeds the rule set into your head a little more"
4585.24,4587.48," than, you know, having it told to you."
4587.48,4590.36, And then maybe you don't retain it quite or why you were just doing that.
4590.36,4591.36, Right.
4591.36,4594.799999999999," And you have these, you know, these tutorial missions with the voice over the treats"
4594.799999999999,4596.36, you like a complete fucking retry.
4596.36,4597.36, I guess it's good.
4597.36,4599.5599999999995, You have now walked to the end of the block.
4599.5599999999995,4600.5599999999995, Good job.
4600.5599999999995,4601.5599999999995," Me, me, me, me, me."
4601.5599999999995,4605.0," Now, you know, try lifting your arm."
4605.0,4606.0, Pressure.
4606.0,4607.0, Right.
4607.0,4608.28, And it's jumped to jump.
4608.28,4609.28, Yeah.
4609.28,4611.719999999999, It seems like maybe back then they just assumed that everyone that played games was like
4611.719999999999,4613.2, really into games.
4613.2,4617.0," Whereas nowadays, because so many casual people buy systems, and they're like really trying"
4617.0,4618.0, to make a lot of money.
4618.0,4619.0, That's exactly how they're going to do.
4619.0,4620.0, Yeah.
4620.0,4624.04," Like you sang the other day that like, I don't know, a few hundred thousand doesn't"
4624.04,4626.44, constitute like a financial success anymore.
4626.44,4627.44, Yeah.
4627.44,4628.44, Right.
4628.44,4630.24, People weren't buying fallout from Walmart.
4630.24,4631.24," They were, right."
4631.24,4635.36," You don't fall, but games of that era, they're getting it from, you know, Sam's computer"
4635.36,4636.36, check.
4636.36,4641.36," Well, it's funny when the interplay logo boots up for the first time on the game, you"
4641.36,4643.32," know, another company now on gone."
4643.32,4647.32," It's, it's that old by gamers, for gamers, seeing is what is what spins around."
4647.32,4649.96," And, you know, that used to be something that a game comes up."
4649.96,4653.04," But he could say, and they, and you knew it was actually true."
4653.04,4655.04," You know, and that's really how the thing plays."
4655.04,4658.4800000000005," It's like, okay, here's these people who get what an RPG is."
4658.4800000000005,4661.64," They know what is fun, and they made it."
4661.64,4666.44," You know, and, and, you know, you're not going through a series of what feels like compromises"
4666.44,4668.0, to this audience or that audience.
4668.0,4669.0, Whatever.
4669.0,4673.24," Like, this is just a straight up fucking hardcore RPG, and they're not messing around."
4673.24,4677.44, The other thing about that is that it's pretty damn slow-paced.
4677.44,4682.08," You know, it's, it's, the combat is, is turn-based."
4682.08,4688.32," You can maneuver through the world in real time, but if as soon as there's an enemy"
4688.32,4694.12," within a proximity, the things switches into, uh, into turn-based, and you have a certain amount"
4694.12,4699.799999999999," of action points to use, per turn, in which you could do whatever, reload your weapon,"
4699.799999999999,4703.719999999999," uh, put a Stimpac in for health, do whatever."
4703.72,4708.04," And so every single encounter, uh, can take, like, a while."
4708.04,4712.4800000000005," I mean, depending on your stats, depending on how you're handling the situation."
4712.4800000000005,4719.360000000001," So it, it, it takes the pace of the game down to a level that I, again, I'm not sure"
4719.360000000001,4721.08, that would fly now.
4721.08,4724.64, I think people would be too impatient for the kind of game that this is.
4724.64,4728.92," That's interesting that that's, like, true of games, because that's true of, like, certainly"
4728.92,4730.92," of, like, film and television."
4730.92,4731.92," Um, I don't know."
4732.16,4735.8," I guess, like, shows, like, the, you know, the resurgence of, of serious shows, like,"
4735.8,4736.8, lost flying the face step.
4736.8,4741.4," But when you look at the way that most movies are edited now, like, in the post MTV era,"
4741.4,4745.72," where it was basically just, we got used to this barrage of sights and sounds, and not"
4745.72,4748.0," even always, holy, you know, coherent."
4748.0,4750.28," And then you look at, like, a Stanley Kubrick movie or something."
4750.28,4754.92," Like, if you watch 2001 now, like, it's great for me, but like, younger people, like,"
4754.92,4758.24," I try to recommend that the people in their watch, like, to what the fuck is that?"
4758.24,4761.84," It's a spaceship, but there's, it starts off, there's a spaceship on one side of the screen."
4761.84,4765.92," And in the distance, there's, like, another space, and then this thing is going to go"
4765.92,4769.639999999999," dock there, but I'm going to have to watch it go across this whole screen."
4769.639999999999,4773.88," And I got a half hour of like nowadays you show a ship, and then boom, you cut to it,"
4773.88,4776.08," like, people getting out the door of the ship."
4776.08,4779.4," Yeah, right, the kind of born, born movie, pace."
4779.4,4781.679999999999," Which, of course, has its own charms in some way."
4781.679999999999,4782.679999999999, Don't want to.
4782.679999999999,4783.679999999999," Yeah, it's not what you do."
4783.679999999999,4784.679999999999, That's what you do.
4784.679999999999,4785.679999999999, That's what you do.
4785.679999999999,4786.679999999999, That's what you do.
4786.68,4788.72, It is good to go to some extent.
4788.72,4792.6, I find it's refreshing to look at something that does use a whole other pace.
4792.6,4795.4800000000005, And that's informed by a whole different set of standards.
4795.4800000000005,4796.4800000000005, Exactly.
4796.4800000000005,4798.360000000001, And that's what fallout is.
4798.360000000001,4802.200000000001," And I think, you know, some people who have just been hearing the hype about"
4802.200000000001,4806.320000000001," fallout three, or maybe even people who played the original games and went back now, I think"
4806.320000000001,4811.0, would be surprised the way I was at really how slow it is.
4811.0,4817.4," I mean, to get through one, you know, small area of fallout one, which is only just one"
4817.4,4823.76," little piece of a big world can take hours, you know, which I find fun."
4823.76,4828.76," It's a rise for you somewhere the way you can, you can make sense of the analogy, but"
4828.76,4832.84," I'm always downtown, say, and you go like, right after high school, and we're cruising"
4832.84,4837.44," around, we went at this porn store, and they had like, what?"
4837.44,4838.44, Had this.
4838.44,4840.96," They had how are you going to get, they had laid out on the moon."
4840.96,4845.32," I had to say the age because I was brought all like 19 or something, you know, and it was"
4845.32,4846.32, ridiculous.
4846.32,4848.72," So we go into this booth and we're like, what's all this about?"
4848.72,4849.72, We knew it was about.
4849.72,4853.32," And you put in the corner and you can, and it turns on this movie."
4853.32,4857.56," Remember, my friend Chuck, you was like, there's like a woman tied up."
4857.56,4860.04," So it was like some like light, you know, bodditching."
4860.04,4861.64," And he was like, seriously, freaking out."
4861.64,4863.92, We don't have time to watch you get on tie.
4863.92,4864.92, Hurry up.
4864.92,4868.72," He's really had like, you know, five minutes for a cool, a doll."
4868.72,4871.16, You need any foreplayers and he bonded foreplay.
4871.16,4875.320000000001," Yes, I just imagine now, one of today's kids playing fallout."
4875.320000000001,4878.12," And it's like, you don't have time to watch your get on tie."
4878.12,4879.12, You have a right.
4879.12,4883.88," Yeah, I mean, you know, and so, you know, I just think about it in terms of like the"
4883.88,4888.4400000000005," level of criticism, I don't want to get back into the ridiculous, you know, fallout"
4888.4400000000005,4889.4400000000005, frameworks.
4889.4400000000005,4892.320000000001, But I do think that there's a certain amount of people who were maybe wishing that
4892.320000000001,4894.92, Bethesda would make a game like the old games.
4894.92,4896.92, And I really just don't think you could do that now.
4896.92,4897.92, Right.
4898.16,4902.32, It's interesting to get a set of numbers you need for a successful giant production
4902.32,4903.32, like fallout.
4903.32,4906.12, It would be great in some ways if they could and did.
4906.12,4907.12, Right.
4907.12,4908.72," I mean, you could make something for the hardcore few."
4908.72,4909.72, Yeah.
4909.72,4910.72, Can't do that.
4910.72,4911.72, It's interesting.
4911.72,4914.92," You're going back and seeing that because, you know, you were recommending it a couple"
4914.92,4915.92, of episodes.
4915.92,4916.92, Yeah.
4916.92,4920.92," To me, and it makes me wonder if you were doing one of those things where you tell someone,"
4920.92,4923.6," oh, you got to check out this album or you need to get this book or something."
4923.6,4926.12, But then it might have been years and years since you've played it.
4926.12,4929.12," So you go back and you listen to it and you're like, oh, shit."
4929.12,4929.72, Yeah.
4929.72,4930.32, What did I do?
4930.32,4931.5199999999995, I must have been on some reef.
4931.5199999999995,4933.5199999999995, What I was listening to this.
4933.5199999999995,4934.72, I am accepted.
4934.72,4936.72, I am still saying it is still awesome.
4936.72,4937.32, Yeah.
4937.32,4939.72, It's still a classic PC game.
4939.72,4942.5199999999995, But it's definitely old now.
4942.5199999999995,4943.0199999999995, Yeah.
4943.0199999999995,4948.82," You know, it definitely is not if you're looking at it with fresh eyes, you know, from a certain"
4948.82,4952.72," perspective, there will be a kind of WTF thing going on with it."
4952.72,4953.72, Not for me.
4953.72,4955.92, That many years in gaming is an eternity.
4955.92,4957.42, It is an eternity.
4957.42,4962.72, I'm impressed that I'm playing Resident Evil 4 on We Now and that because I played it on
4962.72,4966.96," Gamecube and it first came out and playing it, I got sucked into it over the weekend and"
4966.96,4969.72, just like poop sucked into the now and the very end of the game already.
4969.72,4971.12," And I was like, I was so impressed."
4971.12,4976.62," Like, God, it was a whole generation of hardware go and this game is still that awesome."
4976.62,4977.62, I still love it.
4977.62,4979.52," And that was, and that seemed like an accomplishment."
4979.52,4981.72, And that's where talking about it was that two years ago.
4981.72,4982.22, Sure.
4982.22,4982.72, Yeah.
4982.72,4984.12," I don't like that more than that, maybe."
4984.12,4985.92, How are the weak controls?
4985.92,4986.92, It's great.
4986.92,4988.320000000001," It's, it makes it a better game."
4988.320000000001,4989.320000000001, You took a great game.
4989.320000000001,4990.320000000001, That's taking up the game.
4990.320000000001,4992.320000000001, I was already 10 in my mind.
4992.320000000001,4997.72, And it's like now it's just as good and the controls are fantastic for the firing was actually
4997.72,5001.12, one of the problems I was having when I tried to play it on the game kit.
5001.12,5002.12, Right.
5002.12,5003.12, So does it make it too easy?
5003.12,5004.12, No.
5004.12,5005.12, Okay.
5005.12,5006.12, People complain about that.
5006.12,5007.12, It's time to make it.
5007.12,5008.12, Because it's not a pinpoint.
5008.12,5009.12, It's not like it's not a dot.
5009.12,5010.92," It's pretty, and it still randomizes it."
5010.92,5013.52," So if you put it over someone's head, it's not going to blow it up every time."
5013.52,5016.52," But they're part, the game is so, you keep striking when he times he died."
5016.52,5018.32, I've already died like 30 something times.
5018.32,5020.32," I mean, I'm at the end now on the island."
5020.32,5022.12," But it's like, I'm not used to that."
5022.12,5025.92," I mean, most games, if I die that many times, that's when I say fuck this."
5025.92,5027.52," But it's so, it's still hard."
5027.52,5030.32, But there are parts that we're definitely easier and I loved it like when you're writing
5030.32,5031.32, the escalator.
5031.32,5034.32," When you're writing, it's kind of like the tramp thing, like the ski lift."
5034.32,5037.72, And there's like a bunch of enemies on the cars opposite you and some of dynamite.
5037.72,5039.92, There's some with crossbows or whatever way down.
5039.92,5044.12," Like that part because when you just hit a guy and they're standing on a ledge, they will fall off."
5044.12,5049.12," But it was fine because there's enough hard parts in the game that when there's a part where you're like,"
5049.12,5050.72," okay, that wasn't so bad."
5050.72,5051.72, That's good.
5051.72,5054.72, It makes you feel like you need to feel relieved when it's night game.
5054.72,5057.92," So does it really use the we-mo, like you would kind of expect?"
5057.92,5061.52," You can also use it to reload and it's, yeah, it's great for reloading."
5061.52,5064.12," It makes it easier to reload and the knife thing, it's perfect."
5064.12,5068.12," Instead of having to hold a button, you can still do that where you hold a button and you press another button"
5068.12,5070.72, to do a slash with that.
5070.72,5075.32," And that's great for when, especially in that game when you want to conserve ammo, you shoot someone in the knee."
5075.32,5077.32, So he falls in the ground and then you run up and stab them.
5077.32,5079.12, Then you're just kind of like slashing with the we-mo.
5079.12,5082.5199999999995, I thought that very simple but very effective use for that.
5084.92,5086.12, So I'm having a bad-
5086.12,5089.72," That one has been calling me like on the shell recently because I've been,"
5089.72,5090.72, sure on.
5090.72,5092.92, Are there reviews sort of holding up to what you're saying?
5093.92,5096.32," Just in general, is that like the accepted without a mother?"
5096.32,5098.12, I didn't read there. It came out a while.
5098.12,5100.32," It came out like a year ago, right?"
5100.32,5101.12, What?
5101.12,5102.12," Well, no, not a year ago."
5102.12,5103.12, At the beginning of this year?
5103.12,5106.719999999999," In game history, in terms it's been like, I'm so inium."
5106.719999999999,5106.92, Yeah.
5106.92,5107.92, That's the thing.
5107.92,5109.12, We talk about constantly games.
5109.12,5110.719999999999, It's like so old news for everyone.
5110.719999999999,5111.719999999999, Yeah.
5111.719999999999,5113.92, Some people don't want to hear it at all.
5113.92,5115.92," Yeah, that's why I got back into, like I said,"
5115.92,5118.92," I think I've been, you know how to hardcore, like all day,"
5118.92,5119.92, you said it.
5119.92,5120.719999999999," Yeah, that happened by the way."
5120.719999999999,5121.719999999999, I don't really know.
5121.719999999999,5122.92, It was just all of a sudden.
5122.92,5124.5199999999995," It's been on my like pile of like,"
5124.52,5126.92, I gotta go back to this game because I never really finished with it.
5126.92,5129.320000000001, I think I just got distracted by how the day releases.
5129.320000000001,5129.92, Yeah.
5129.92,5131.120000000001, And it's so good.
5131.120000000001,5132.320000000001," I mean, you know this."
5132.320000000001,5133.320000000001, Yeah.
5133.320000000001,5134.92, I know it was fantastic.
5134.92,5136.320000000001, But from it's amazing game.
5136.320000000001,5141.320000000001," Like, I mean, it is, it is like a cuter, whack your garden based"
5141.320000000001,5142.72, Sims in a lot of ways.
5142.72,5146.320000000001," And it's just fun trying to, you know, set up the conditions in your garden"
5146.320000000001,5147.72, to attract certain.
5147.72,5150.320000000001, I think it has that same appeal that Emma most do.
5150.320000000001,5152.92," Because since it's like tons of little quests,"
5153.32,5156.12, where you're always like as soon as I just get this piniotta and then you get that
5156.12,5158.92," piniotta and a new piniotta rolls up and he's like, well,"
5158.92,5161.32," as soon as I get that piniotta, it gets that same thing."
5161.32,5161.52," Oh, yeah."
5161.52,5161.72, Yeah.
5161.72,5162.72, That's the one that's good.
5162.72,5163.72, You can't question.
5163.72,5163.92, Yeah.
5163.92,5165.52," And like animal crossing too, right?"
5165.52,5165.72, Yeah.
5165.72,5166.52, Yeah.
5166.52,5168.32, Even more than animal crossing for me.
5168.32,5170.12," Like, you don't like animal crossing."
5170.12,5171.52," Oh, I don't know."
5171.52,5173.12," There's something, I don't know."
5173.12,5175.12," Again, this game feels like work."
5175.12,5180.12," But animal crossing for some reason, it's like a magnet for,"
5180.12,5182.32, I gotta be careful about the terminology.
5182.32,5184.719999999999," Yeah, especially since most of us like that game in this room."
5184.719999999999,5186.32," Yeah, Sean for autism."
5186.32,5187.719999999999, What are you saying about us?
5187.719999999999,5188.12, OK.
5188.12,5192.12, I think it's probably universally adored by people with autism.
5192.12,5192.719999999999, OK.
5192.719999999999,5193.5199999999995, I'm saying that series.
5193.5199999999995,5194.32, I don't mean it.
5194.32,5196.12," I'm mocking, but it's weird to me."
5196.12,5198.5199999999995," Like, I don't understand it."
5198.5199999999995,5199.12, You don't get it.
5199.12,5201.719999999999, And I games stupid to me.
5201.719999999999,5203.32, And it's not because I have no imagination.
5203.32,5207.12," It's not because I don't like, I have to be blowing things up to have"
5207.12,5208.32, like animal case at all.
5208.32,5212.12," You know, but it's just there's when I did try it."
5212.12,5216.72," Based on these crazy recommendations and these just universally great scores,"
5216.72,5217.92, there's nothing to it.
5217.92,5220.5199999999995, There's nothing really nothing going on.
5220.5199999999995,5223.5199999999995," There's no, the limit, the system is so specific."
5223.5199999999995,5227.5199999999995, There's not much play around the periphery around the borders where things get fun.
5227.5199999999995,5228.92," Yeah, but it's still very scary."
5228.92,5230.5199999999995, You decorate your house yet.
5230.5199999999995,5231.92," It's like, I love these guys."
5231.92,5232.5199999999995, I don't know.
5232.5199999999995,5234.72," It's just like, people don't like the periphery as much, I guess."
5234.72,5239.5199999999995," They like having a bounded box where they have very specific roles,"
5239.5199999999995,5241.5199999999995, but they can do anything they want with the mother roles.
5241.92,5243.72, And I think that's more what animal crossing is.
5243.72,5244.72, Yeah.
5244.72,5249.52," Some of us like to be in our little boxes, Sean, the thing that some of us aren't even"
5249.52,5250.320000000001, autistic.
5250.320000000001,5255.320000000001," I'm thinking more, but again, it's not all animal crossing fans are autistic, but"
5255.320000000001,5257.320000000001, all autistic people are animal crossing.
5257.320000000001,5258.320000000001, Okay.
5258.320000000001,5261.320000000001," It's like, wow, that's not a controversial statement to make."
5261.320000000001,5263.320000000001, That's a very first statement.
5263.320000000001,5264.320000000001, That's like that.
5264.320000000001,5265.320000000001, Yeah.
5265.320000000001,5267.320000000001, I know it gets a lot of stuff.
5267.32,5268.32," Yeah, I don't know."
5268.32,5269.32, I don't know if I'm autistic.
5269.32,5271.32," But I mean, genuine, like people that are very clearly autistic."
5271.32,5275.32, I'm thinking of like YouTube videos and message forward activity and so on.
5275.32,5277.32," That one, too, I think we watched the has autism."
5277.32,5278.32, And it appears.
5278.32,5280.32," Yeah, I never seen him over an animal crossing."
5280.32,5282.32, He was playing animal crossing.
5282.32,5283.32," He was too, dude."
5283.32,5285.32," Are you thinking of what, is Sean at you?"
5285.32,5286.32," Yeah, Sean at you."
5286.32,5287.32," Fuckin' yes, he is."
5287.32,5289.32, I said you the link when we're done taping.
5289.32,5290.32, All right.
5290.32,5291.32," Oh, shit."
5291.32,5293.32, So yeah.
5293.32,5294.32, So if you've been to the top.
5294.32,5295.32," Yeah, anyway."
5296.32,5300.32, I don't know how well it did because I want the what playing.
5300.32,5301.32, I decided to do it.
5301.32,5305.32, On 30th to get eventually sold a million worldwide or something like that.
5305.32,5307.32," Yeah, but that's not a boring thing."
5307.32,5308.32, I don't know.
5308.32,5310.32, Because I like this game to me.
5310.32,5314.32, Like there are so many little nitpicky things that drive me insane about it.
5314.32,5318.32, That it just like right at the boundaries of where it could be awesome.
5318.32,5321.32, That I just want like there's so simple to address in this.
5321.32,5326.32, We'll just like certain things about limitations on the number of pinnotted you can have a pretty sure just technical.
5326.32,5331.32, But it always occurs right when you're about to see if you want to start a new garden.
5331.32,5334.32," Yeah, so you have to like start with these new gardens just to hold more pinnotted."
5334.32,5336.32, And I'm pretty sure it is really just a typical amount of things.
5336.32,5338.32, I don't think there's going to be a sequel though.
5338.32,5342.32, I think I think you're going to the DS one is the last one they're going to do.
5342.32,5345.32, Is that stuff like that and the because there make you perfect dark zero to.
5347.32,5348.32, There's something.
5348.32,5350.32," Well, you always got to cut you in Sean."
5351.32,5353.32, That was full of tips.
5353.32,5356.32," Oh, a three, three firm."
5356.32,5357.32, That's what I do attract.
5357.32,5359.32, That's why I learned to get a tune of coin.
5359.32,5361.32," Yeah, really from the TV show."
5361.32,5362.32, Yeah.
5362.32,5363.32, You need to gem tree.
5363.32,5366.32," I mean, we get I work just like the Pokemon."
5366.32,5370.32," No, I just I just watched it at some point because of the next box live for free."
5370.32,5372.32, The Pokemon show.
5372.32,5373.32," Yeah, I used to watch it."
5373.32,5376.32," I mean, it's the same thing we're like, okay, I was only in my 30s."
5376.32,5379.32, There are tips and playing the game embedded in the fights.
5379.32,5380.32, Sure.
5380.32,5381.32, Like that's part of the point of them.
5381.32,5385.32," It's like, look, did you know that Charmander can do this against this weakness?"
5385.32,5386.32," Oh, no, you do."
5386.32,5388.32," Yeah, you have to watch that show with a note pad."
5388.32,5389.32, Yeah.
5389.32,5392.32, It's like going to school watching Pokemon.
5392.32,5393.32, Check this out.
5393.32,5394.32, I was just going to just go.
5394.32,5395.32, Sean is just going to do that.
5395.32,5397.32, I want to keep doing this.
5397.32,5398.32, It's kind of egging here.
5398.32,5399.32, I want to go.
5399.32,5402.32, I'm willing to go and get lost the game.
5402.32,5403.32, I want to try it.
5403.32,5404.32, I was thinking that myself.
5404.32,5406.32, I thought of that too.
5406.32,5410.32, We have trying to get Ryan trying to get Ryan trying to get Ryan the mic.
5410.32,5412.32," Okay, pass the mic."
5412.32,5413.32, We can't.
5413.32,5414.32," We're not getting lost in house, right?"
5414.32,5416.32," Because I mean, we're not getting it sent to us."
5416.32,5417.32," No, because you've been soft."
5417.32,5418.32, But the game's out.
5418.32,5419.32, We can go get it.
5419.32,5420.32, I'll be in our library.
5420.32,5421.32, Okay.
5421.32,5422.32, I heard his shorts.
5422.32,5423.32, We can pass it along.
5423.32,5424.32, We only need one copy.
5424.32,5425.32, I'm very curious.
5425.32,5426.32, I will play that one.
5426.32,5427.32," You guys, you really want to play that game?"
5427.32,5430.32," I wrote a few said it was great, except the game was shit."
5430.32,5433.32," Yeah, the game of former review said it was great, but the game is shit."
5433.32,5435.32, But it was a good update on it.
5435.32,5439.32," They insisted in it, though, that it has significant plot development."
5439.32,5440.32," No, no."
5440.32,5443.32, It will change the way you read the series.
5443.32,5445.32, It seems to have a nice side of it.
5445.32,5446.32, It's not canon.
5446.32,5447.32, It's not canon.
5447.32,5448.32, The game does not count.
5448.32,5449.32, They're not taking the game.
5449.32,5450.32, How do you feel?
5450.32,5455.32, And they gave the game like the score they did based on that quality of the revelations.
5455.32,5460.32," Well, I mean, that's a problem I have with the show in general is the amount of offline revelations."
5460.32,5461.32, They've made just like little things.
5461.32,5463.32, They said most of them don't count.
5463.32,5464.32," Well, they're stupid."
5464.32,5465.32, And why are you doing them?
5465.32,5467.32," I think, yeah, lost for us."
5467.32,5470.32," Except of some of the like last fan, lost the fanfic, the game."
5470.32,5471.32," Well, kind of is, right?"
5471.32,5473.32," If that's what it does, maybe I'm trying to do it."
5473.32,5476.32, They've said explicitly that the game is not canon.
5476.32,5478.32, So this game is fanfanned and did Lord.
5478.32,5479.32, The game is not.
5479.32,5484.32," I'm just saying when I use the term canon, you and Rory both gave me a ton of shit about it."
5484.32,5488.32," I was just writing, though, people thought that like I was seriously giving you shit."
5488.32,5489.32, What was it?
5489.32,5490.32, They did it last week.
5490.32,5492.32," People are mad, and I was picking you for what?"
5492.32,5493.32, Right.
5493.32,5495.32, Those are all Ryan defense force on the threads.
5495.32,5496.32, What was it?
5496.32,5501.32, I don't know what I forget.
5501.32,5503.32, Ryan can even Chris.
5503.32,5508.32, Can you publicly say that you would defend yourself if you were really pissed off at
5508.32,5510.32, Sean for picking on you?
5510.32,5516.32," Yeah, like if you ever thought I was seriously giving you shit, like I was really trying to bug you."
5516.32,5517.32," Yeah, I mean, this is understanding."
5517.32,5519.32, We really each other all the time.
5519.32,5524.32," It's like it's not a big show where we were, you know, you're making fun of me for having"
5524.32,5526.32," all the like, yeah, you're taking it just off of my wall."
5526.32,5528.32, I knew what I was walking into.
5528.32,5529.32, What I started talking to.
5529.32,5530.32, Totally.
5530.32,5532.32," You know, I don't get like thinking the last of you already thing."
5532.32,5533.32, Right.
5533.32,5535.32," I like the laugh at it, but we've all had to speak."
5535.32,5540.32, Man can't see our mind has to Sean voodoo doll at home after we got that.
5540.32,5543.32," But it was like particularly, it was in the last weeks."
5543.32,5544.32," Yeah, well, so something like that."
5544.32,5547.32, It was something that was so they were very upset.
5547.32,5550.32, So like I can't I don't even have any of what they were referring to.
5550.32,5552.32, So it must not bug me that much.
5552.32,5553.32, Yeah.
5553.32,5554.32, Okay.
5554.32,5555.32, So what's for Pimp and Smash Brothers?
5555.32,5557.32," Oh, smash feathers is awesome."
5557.32,5562.32," I know, but it was like because you did all the, um, it was for saying that you were stoken"
5562.32,5563.32, people's game boners or less.
5563.32,5564.32, Because you did too.
5564.32,5565.32, That's because if one up you were.
5565.32,5569.32," I was going to say, but that's what I mean, I think like hardcore Nintendo fans and hardcore"
5569.32,5571.32, Ryan fans that are crossing them.
5572.32,5573.32, It's just like the Uber people.
5573.32,5575.32, That's a field of hardcore fans.
5575.32,5576.32, Yeah.
5576.32,5577.32, I don't know.
5577.32,5578.32, Baby got that.
5578.32,5579.32, Yeah.
5579.32,5580.32, It's a long comfortable isn't it.
5580.32,5582.32, They wish Ryan was a playable character.
5582.32,5583.32, Okay.
5583.32,5585.32," So what's your last theory, sir?"
5585.32,5586.32, So okay.
5586.32,5588.32, Based on last episode of your talk.
5588.32,5590.32," Well, okay. So, you know, spoiler spoiler alert."
5590.32,5591.32," Oh, it's part of the topic."
5591.32,5593.32, It's part of the topic spoiler.
5593.32,5597.32, And also spoilers for if you're the kind of crazy person who's not going to watch
5597.32,5600.32," the trailer for next week, spoilers for the trailer for this week."
5600.32,5601.32, Okay.
5601.32,5602.32, You've been warned.
5602.32,5603.32, I never don't complain.
5603.32,5604.32, So I like to hear about it.
5604.32,5608.32, I don't get to see those because I watch that episode online so that those don't.
5608.32,5611.32," Well, there's some crazy stuff going on on the other side of the whole."
5611.32,5612.32," Oh, look at how you guys hear in the comments."
5612.32,5613.32, Yeah.
5613.32,5614.32, The fucking said.
5614.32,5616.32, So it's like a little bit like an inner office.
5616.32,5617.32, Okay.
5617.32,5618.32, That's awesome.
5618.32,5619.32, It's a hatch exploding.
5619.32,5620.32," Well, a V1."
5620.32,5621.32, Okay.
5621.32,5623.32, So last week's episode.
5623.32,5627.32," You know, we find out that son is member of the Oceanics 6."
5627.32,5628.32, Thanks.
5629.32,5630.32," Yes, better."
5630.32,5631.32, Yeah.
5631.32,5635.32," And Jim, I'm thinking, well, first of all, I'm thinking Jim's not really dead."
5635.32,5636.32, Okay.
5636.32,5642.32, There's a lot of people who don't think he's alive in an alternate time.
5642.32,5643.32, Why?
5643.32,5645.32, Because they were crying at his gravestone.
5645.32,5647.32, They never said he was dead.
5647.32,5648.32, Right.
5648.32,5649.32, They're coming.
5649.32,5650.32, They can't get him back on the island.
5650.32,5652.32, We saw a gravestone with the date of the crash on it.
5652.32,5655.32, And I'm assuming there are gravesstone for many people.
5655.32,5656.32, Yes.
5657.32,5658.32, So we're with you there.
5658.32,5659.32, Okay.
5659.32,5660.32, That's not my theory.
5660.32,5661.32, That's not the main.
5661.32,5662.32, That's theory.
5662.32,5663.32, Which is so.
5663.32,5664.32, So the trailer.
5664.32,5668.32, The trailer for this week's episode.
5668.32,5670.32," You know, ABC did one of those things."
5670.32,5672.32, It's like someone will die.
5672.32,5674.32, Which they always freaking do.
5674.32,5680.32, And this week is it's Michael focused.
5680.32,5681.32," Oh, it is."
5681.32,5683.32, It's not going to be about my role.
5684.32,5689.32, And so somebody somebody's supposed to be dying.
5689.32,5690.32, Okay.
5690.32,5692.32, And my theory is getting all tense in here.
5692.32,5694.32, My crazy crackpot theory.
5694.32,5695.32, Yeah.
5695.32,5697.32, About who the dead characters are going to be.
5697.32,5701.32, It's going to do some sort of like revelation that it's going to be wall.
5701.32,5706.32, And wall is going to have been dead long long before this.
5706.32,5707.32, Wait.
5707.32,5708.32, So walled.
5708.32,5709.32, So they're going to do some.
5709.32,5710.32, It's been time travel crap.
5710.32,5712.32," Well, I think because you know, because like we haven't seen wall."
5713.32,5715.32," Well, we really didn't see a lot of the whole thing."
5715.32,5716.32," Well, we saw."
5716.32,5718.32, We haven't seen much of wall.
5718.32,5719.32, My boy is using wine.
5719.32,5721.32, Because what was abducted.
5721.32,5723.32, He showed up throughout season two a little bit.
5723.32,5726.32," And you know, he's been in like he's showing up."
5726.32,5727.32," You know, to lock and all."
5727.32,5729.32," See, like I'm watching this."
5729.32,5731.32," So when I feel like I'm at the, uh, the Berkeley."
5731.32,5733.32," You see, I mean, the, you see,"
5733.32,5734.32, I can't.
5734.32,5736.32, You see Berkeley campus.
5736.32,5737.32, The talk into the tree squatters.
5737.32,5738.32, Okay.
5738.32,5739.32, Okay.
5739.32,5740.32, So.
5741.32,5743.32, We've seen walled.
5743.32,5745.32," How often all these weird places, you know,"
5745.32,5748.32, when lock was in the ditch and all that stuff.
5748.32,5753.32," And like, you know, we've seen something take the form of like dead people in the past."
5753.32,5754.32, Mm-hmm.
5754.32,5756.32," And that would, you know, if walled's like really dead,"
5756.32,5758.32, that that just feel like a cool twist.
5758.32,5760.32," Like, you know, hey, walled's walled's been dead."
5760.32,5762.32, I think you're on a something there.
5762.32,5763.32," Oh, like."
5763.32,5766.32," The whole time walled's been, well, we had, like I said,"
5766.32,5768.32, we haven't seen him consistently since the end of season one.
5768.32,5770.32," For a season two onward, he's been like,"
5770.32,5773.32, So what does that mean for all the people who have chronicled scene walled?
5773.32,5774.32, I don't know.
5774.32,5775.32, They all see dead people.
5775.32,5778.32," Well, I mean, we've seen like, you know, Jack's father."
5778.32,5781.32," We saw, you know, like, Mr. Echo's brother and all these characters who,"
5781.32,5782.32," Right, you know."
5782.32,5784.32, That might be the smoke monster's manifested.
5784.32,5785.32, Right.
5785.32,5787.32," What the hell is like in, in like a week ago,"
5787.32,5789.32," the woman who, uh,"
5789.32,5790.32, Right.
5790.32,5791.32, That's another one.
5791.32,5792.32," Had it fair with her husband, like,"
5792.32,5794.32, who she's just kicking in the jungle.
5794.32,5795.32," Oh, yeah."
5795.32,5796.32, I didn't even give her a slap you.
5796.32,5797.32, Yeah.
5797.32,5799.32," I was like, yeah, even not even for a second,"
5799.32,5800.32, I think she was really there.
5800.32,5801.32, Right.
5801.32,5803.32," So I mean, here's the thing with losses."
5803.32,5805.32," As soon as you introduce ghosts and time travel,"
5805.32,5807.32, you can do whatever the fuck you want.
5807.32,5808.32, Yeah.
5808.32,5809.32, And they've done both of those.
5809.32,5810.32, So it's just like true.
5810.32,5812.32," Guys, the limit on the note of,"
5812.32,5815.32, I think that you're probably right in that
5815.32,5818.32," Gen isn't that it's just like a mockup, you know."
5818.32,5819.32," Well, it's fun."
5819.32,5820.32," Yeah, it's fun."
5820.32,5821.32," It's hard for some incentive to go back to the island,"
5821.32,5822.32, but you're right.
5822.32,5823.32, Yeah.
5823.32,5825.32," But I think though the one, the one bit of evidence that would say"
5825.32,5829.32, he really is dead is that the actor who portrays him got a DUI.
5829.32,5830.32," Oh, oh, the last."
5830.32,5831.32," Oh, yeah."
5831.32,5832.32, That's a gift for death.
5832.32,5833.32, Yeah.
5833.32,5835.32," There was like hurli's girlfriend and then also,"
5835.32,5837.32, the immrod.
5837.32,5838.32, Huh?
5838.32,5839.32, Immrod.
5839.32,5840.32, Meshaward Reakas.
5840.32,5841.32, Yeah.
5841.32,5842.32, And we're in the red.
5842.32,5843.32, Not a fun.
5843.32,5844.32," The thing goes, yeah, we're all going off."
5844.32,5845.32, Yeah.
5845.32,5846.32, We're in the last ones.
5846.32,5847.32, We're a color emrod.
5847.32,5849.32," And then also Mr. Echo was like supposed to,"
5849.32,5850.32, supposedly like belligerent.
5850.32,5851.32, So yeah.
5851.32,5852.32, And I can very much on the set.
5852.32,5853.32," They gave him the,"
5854.32,5856.32, what the Charlie Begut stick or whatever he used to carry around.
5856.32,5857.32, Hahaha.
5857.32,5859.32, That's a decent impact.
5859.32,5861.32," Oh, so what's the say it's got a DUI."
5861.32,5862.32, He's bones.
5862.32,5863.32, That's that he's dead.
5863.32,5864.32, He's dead.
5864.32,5867.32, He's been killed him all off one by one.
5867.32,5868.32, The DUI's.
5868.32,5869.32, Huh.
5869.32,5871.32, We'll see you about your walt theory.
5871.32,5872.32, We will.
5872.32,5875.32," Well, like, like, I mean, like lost, like,"
5875.32,5877.32," metallogic dick-teach that like,"
5877.32,5881.32," whoever the, whoever whatever character who's that's so good."
5881.32,5882.32, Yeah.
5882.32,5883.32, Yeah.
5883.32,5884.32, Whatever.
5884.32,5885.32, It is this character's episode.
5885.32,5887.32," Therefore, this character must be the one to die."
5887.32,5890.32," Like, because that's the rule that's been the rule for major character deaths."
5890.32,5892.32, And it's like he's going to be Michael and Wallfocus.
5892.32,5894.32," Therefore, it must be one of them."
5894.32,5898.32, And it's not going to be Michael because why would they bring him back for like one at the same.
5898.32,5900.32," Yeah, but they break the run rules all the time."
5900.32,5902.32," Like, why wouldn't they do that next week?"
5902.32,5903.32, Why couldn't they break the run metal?
5903.32,5906.32," I always feel like when a TV show like in the trailer for the song,"
5906.32,5908.32," one they go, someone will die."
5908.32,5909.32," You know, because that's,"
5909.32,5911.32," it's always going to be somebody minor who like,"
5911.32,5912.32, you never even met.
5912.32,5914.32," Oh, yeah, they always like last week's big T's like,"
5914.32,5917.32, someone you never expected will return.
5917.32,5919.32," Yeah, I was just like, I think they did."
5919.32,5922.32," It's like, what's the normal diet?"
5922.32,5924.32, Like someone looks in their wallet and sees a picture.
5924.32,5925.32, They're great grandfather.
5925.32,5927.32," And they're like, yeah, he died last week."
5927.32,5928.32, So think about that.
5928.32,5929.32, They did that with Shannon.
5929.32,5931.32, They did that with Mr. Echo.
5931.32,5935.32, What the ones that were about them were the ones where they died.
5935.32,5937.32," Right. And they, they, they, they, they four casted it again."
5937.32,5938.32, Like someone will die next week.
5938.32,5939.32, Yeah.
5939.32,5940.32," And it's always the person who,"
5940.32,5941.32, I have no doubt someone will die.
5941.32,5942.32, I don't think they just lied to us.
5942.32,5946.32," And it's like, they could, I mean, I could see him killing like a minor character,"
5946.32,5948.32," like, stupid miles."
5948.32,5950.32," I mean, relatively minor."
5950.32,5952.32, Is he still have a great name in his mouth?
5952.32,5954.32, Let's spend three weeks or so.
5954.32,5956.32, I don't mind if they kill lock at this point.
5956.32,5957.32, I think they could kill him.
5957.32,5959.32," I don't, I don't, I don't know."
5959.32,5960.32, Now it's a mental thing.
5960.32,5962.32, I think they can make him really likeable.
5962.32,5964.32," They're, I think they'll eat it."
5964.32,5965.32, It's so nice.
5965.32,5969.32," They're locked in the final moment of, so it's someone else jumps off the damn ship."
5969.32,5970.32," Another like, no."
5970.32,5971.32, Yeah.
5971.32,5973.32, So he belt jumps off again and dies again.
5973.32,5974.32, Yeah.
5974.32,5975.32, He spots up the first.
5975.32,5976.32," Why would they put her in the,"
5976.32,5979.32," I sure, come, you know, just like get that shit specifically."
5979.32,5980.32, And then killer.
5980.32,5981.32," Have never,"
5981.32,5982.32, We're seeing.
5982.32,5983.32, We're seeing a book upside down.
5983.32,5984.32, Yeah.
5984.32,5985.32," Like, she's going to show up in a flashback."
5985.32,5986.32, Because she's like a man.
5986.32,5988.32," The whole time you're babbling on this, like,"
5988.32,5989.32," you're, you're, you're, you're,"
5989.32,5990.32, your name is Orange.
5990.32,5992.32, Anthony is just been on his iPhone.
5992.32,5993.32," But the thing is,"
5994.32,5995.32," I want to, but the reason I don't watch this."
5995.32,5997.32," I want to fight you because last week,"
5997.32,5999.32, you read Walking Dead now.
5999.32,6000.32, I got you into that.
6000.32,6003.32, And you came to me with all of your theories about who it is that's held.
6003.32,6004.32," That's holding, you know,"
6004.32,6007.32, one of the principal characters at gunpoint in the last page.
6007.32,6009.32," And then not only did you have a theory,"
6009.32,6011.32," you went back and you like,"
6011.32,6013.32, we're presenting all of your evidence.
6013.32,6015.32, Why this is the case and how you had it worked out.
6015.32,6017.32, Anthony is putting us iPhone away now and shame.
6017.32,6019.32," But he was, it was the exact same thing."
6019.32,6020.32, I'm not hating on you guys.
6020.32,6021.32, I've got it.
6021.32,6022.32, I've got it.
6022.32,6023.32, That's what I do.
6023.32,6024.32, It's going on.
6024.32,6025.32, That's right.
6025.32,6026.32," Like a lot,"
6026.32,6028.32, you're speaking for a lot of people that listen to the show.
6028.32,6029.32," Yeah, turn down."
6029.32,6030.32, I'll get it there.
6030.32,6032.32, I've turned it off a long time.
6032.32,6033.32, You weren't.
6033.32,6034.32, Still listening and don't listen to watch.
6034.32,6035.32," By the way,"
6035.32,6038.32, thank you for the Walking Dead recommendation because I picked up.
6038.32,6042.32, The first volume I went to the local Berkeley comics drawing bought it.
6042.32,6043.32, And read it.
6043.32,6045.32," One sitting and it was, it was good."
6045.32,6047.32, I didn't think it was great.
6047.32,6048.32, It's shotted out.
6048.32,6049.32, That's why you got to get to the second.
6049.32,6050.32," Well, right."
6050.32,6051.32," I mean, that's what you said."
6051.32,6052.32, I'm not paying on for it.
6052.32,6053.32, Keep telling me that's an awesome.
6053.32,6054.32, It was really good.
6054.32,6055.32, I'm not caught up.
6055.32,6059.32, I've read like for three or four volumes because you guys have to go in.
6059.32,6063.32, I don't want to get it up to individual issues like a year ago.
6063.32,6064.32, Yeah.
6064.32,6065.32, But then stop by it.
6065.32,6068.32," It's easy though, Jeff, because you don't need to go into the book every"
6068.32,6069.32, no.
6069.32,6073.32, It's not because the collections only come out once every what?
6073.32,6075.32," Like six months, seven months."
6075.32,6077.32," So in this case, you can get it on Amazon."
6077.32,6078.32, And it's like what?
6078.32,6079.32," 10, 999 or something."
6079.32,6080.32, That's nice.
6080.32,6085.32," No, I'm going to a store every Wednesday coming back with a bag of bullshit."
6085.32,6086.32, Three lanterns and captain.
6086.32,6087.32," I know, but that's one of the things."
6087.32,6089.32, It's a slippery slope.
6089.32,6091.32, You start getting into these series.
6091.32,6094.32," And then, you know, like, let's say I read all your walking dads, right?"
6094.32,6095.32, And I'm into it.
6095.32,6096.32, And there's a big cliffhanger.
6096.32,6098.32, Am I going to really want to wait for the next one?
6098.32,6099.32, Or am I going to go?
6099.32,6102.32," No, it's just, well, maybe I'll go to Comic Relief and see."
6102.32,6103.32, It's just bar with for me.
6103.32,6104.32, Right.
6104.32,6105.32, I know.
6105.32,6108.32, But I'm just saying knowing myself that I'll go there.
6108.32,6109.32, And then I'll buy one issue.
6109.32,6111.32, And then I'll be looking in the back.
6111.32,6113.32," And I'll see, like, ads for like three other image comics."
6113.32,6114.32," And I'll think, oh, maybe I'll buy it."
6114.32,6117.32," Well, oh, issue one is coming out of this new thing."
6117.32,6118.32, Don't do that.
6118.32,6122.32," See, by the next thing, you know, you got your $30 bag of bullshit."
6122.32,6123.32," No, I just made this mistake."
6123.32,6124.32, Personality problem.
6124.32,6125.32, What is?
6125.32,6126.32, I'm saying.
6126.32,6130.32, I went to Comic Shop with Shawn and Shawn was like never by anything that someone
6130.32,6131.32, doesn't recommend to you.
6131.32,6133.32," So like, Shawn gave me this, this comic."
6133.32,6135.32," And I was like, all right, this looks cool."
6135.32,6141.32, I picked up the ultimate volume to ultimate to volume two because I wanted to finish that.
6141.32,6142.32, Also recommended.
6142.32,6144.32," And then like when Shawn wasn't looking, I saw this other one."
6144.32,6147.32," And I was like, I was like, oh, shit."
6147.32,6148.32, This looks cool.
6148.32,6149.32, What was your goal?
6149.32,6151.32, It was caught up in Redang.
6151.32,6152.32, It was called Common Fo.
6152.32,6154.32, It was like set in the battle of the bulge.
6154.32,6156.32, It sounds like a bullshit premise.
6156.32,6157.32, Set in the battle of bulge.
6157.32,6159.32, It sounds like it only sounds like one.
6159.32,6160.32," It's, it's Nazis."
6160.32,6162.32," And, you know, Americans are fighting."
6162.32,6164.32," And at some point during the show, they blow up the sweltering."
6164.32,6165.32, They blow up this well.
6165.32,6166.32, It's all sealed off.
6166.32,6168.32, And it was holding back some sort of monster.
6168.32,6170.32, That's a big computer case.
6170.32,6171.32," So then they have to like, it's time."
6171.32,6172.32, Just go have turning point.
6172.32,6173.32, Of course.
6173.32,6174.32, It's time.
6174.32,6175.32, Random.
6175.32,6177.32, They end up putting aside their differences to fight monsters.
6177.32,6178.32, High concept.
6178.32,6179.32, But I ended it.
6179.32,6180.32, I ended up getting it.
6180.32,6182.32, And I was so disappointed.
6182.32,6183.32, Really.
6183.32,6184.32, I came to Shawn a shame.
6184.32,6185.32," Dude, you're sitting there."
6185.32,6188.32," I hooked you up with like, I gave you Shaolin cowboy."
6188.32,6191.32, I gave you like a fat stack of the preacher collection.
6191.32,6192.32, But I've already read it.
6193.32,6194.32, You're getting it.
6194.32,6196.32, I just gave you meta barons.
6196.32,6202.32, And then you had like all these basically you're you're sitting in enough like cream of the crop from the last decade.
6202.32,6211.32," Like the very coolest for for for comics that aren't just like non-genre, you know, some of the coolest stuff from like filtered."
6211.32,6216.32, Consumers of fairly selective when it comes to comics and the ones that I like I think are crap.
6216.32,6219.32," And then you just don't just go fucking pick in anything, man."
6219.32,6220.32, To get listen to dad.
6220.32,6221.32, No.
6221.32,6226.32, I got I got I got I got two con for recommendations for for everybody go forward.
6226.32,6231.32," First one is dark horses, Conan series by Kurt Busik."
6231.32,6232.32, Kurt Busik really.
6232.32,6233.32, Yeah.
6233.32,6234.32, Nice.
6234.32,6235.32, Okay.
6235.32,6237.32, I was a big astro city fan back in the day.
6237.32,6238.32, Does he still doing that?
6238.32,6239.32, Astro city.
6239.32,6240.32, Yeah.
6240.32,6241.32, Look at your face on why you making it.
6241.32,6242.32, Just for that.
6242.32,6243.32, Yeah.
6243.32,6244.32, What's the making that?
6244.32,6245.32, That's the city was okay.
6245.32,6246.32, Okay.
6246.32,6247.32, I was going to say he was already shit on it with his looks.
6247.32,6248.32, They had a few good.
6248.32,6249.32, Had a few good episodes.
6249.32,6250.32, I read the first two of that cone and one.
6250.32,6251.32, The first one.
6251.32,6253.32, Is he basically we're talking to the story of that?
6253.32,6254.32, Maybe.
6254.32,6256.32, Is the third one awesome?
6256.32,6257.32, I thought.
6257.32,6260.32, So are these coming from the original novels or why?
6260.32,6263.32, They are adaptations of the original property house stories.
6263.32,6264.32, Okay.
6264.32,6267.32, There's separate separate schools that go on.
6267.32,6268.32, Sorry.
6268.32,6269.32, No.
6269.32,6271.32," Well, there's separate schools of like people who recommend."
6271.32,6272.32, Of different types.
6272.32,6277.32," There's like a few chief types of comic or, you know, recommenders."
6277.32,6278.32," Oh, I see how it is."
6278.32,6281.16, And then there's a good one in the battle.
6281.16,6282.36, That would be fair to say.
6282.36,6284.96," Of course, that's how each person in each camp sees it."
6284.96,6286.799999999999," But then there's the group that will recommend,"
6286.799999999999,6287.599999999999," oh, you're getting into comics."
6287.599999999999,6289.04, You got to retransmatcher Paulathan.
6289.04,6290.96," You've got to read the, uh, the sandman."
6290.96,6293.4, And then what happens is a lot of people.
6293.4,6298.84, I can consider my job like undoing all the trauma that those people have caused.
6298.84,6303.679999999999, And how they've driven people away from the momentum and even trauma in retransmatcher.
6305.679999999999,6308.04," Anthony, you, you stopped reading comics"
6308.04,6309.4, because someone recommended that to.
6309.4,6310.4, It wasn't that.
6310.4,6311.8, It was that I read.
6311.8,6312.0, It was that I read.
6312.0,6312.6, It's not fine.
6312.6,6313.44, Really like at that much.
6313.44,6314.24, But it wasn't enough.
6314.24,6315.24, There was.
6315.24,6316.44, It's the difference between.
6316.44,6318.88," It's not recommending to all crap, but it's recommending crap."
6318.88,6322.12, But that's like really not that good.
6322.12,6322.96," Like, I don't know, man."
6322.96,6325.2," There's, that's why it's so funny."
6325.2,6328.2," Like, and it, the split is perfectly like,"
6328.2,6330.04, it's between preacher.
6330.04,6330.5199999999995, Yeah.
6330.5199999999995,6332.76," People that like preacher, people that like sandman because like,"
6332.76,6336.76," it preacher, it directly attacks the sandman fans and the sandman"
6336.76,6339.4800000000005," writer to the point that there's like this, there's this character."
6339.4800000000005,6340.320000000001, But you can like both.
6340.320000000001,6340.4400000000005, Yeah.
6340.4400000000005,6341.96," What is it like, I like both?"
6341.96,6345.96," Like, I think sandman doesn't hold up that well now when I read it."
6345.96,6348.84," But like, at the time, you're the dude who, when you go to his house"
6348.84,6353.56," and you start browsing around looking into CD collection, you see like CNC music"
6353.56,6356.96, factory right next to like Nirvana or something.
6356.96,6358.96, I cannot deny that.
6358.96,6361.400000000001, You're a generalist.
6361.400000000001,6362.400000000001, Yes.
6362.400000000001,6363.400000000001, Let me do.
6363.400000000001,6364.400000000001, Me too.
6364.400000000001,6365.400000000001, I got to that.
6365.48,6368.32, And Nirvana and I'm all over the place.
6368.32,6371.36, Reggae and Johnny Mitchell and Peru.
6371.36,6373.799999999999, But your name and now you're naming good stuff though.
6373.799999999999,6374.48," Like, I don't know."
6374.48,6376.679999999999," I want to, we can name shit and I'll have it too."
6376.679999999999,6378.44," I have to, I have electric light orchestra."
6378.44,6379.16, How's that?
6379.16,6380.639999999999," Dude, he can get where I'm talking like,"
6380.639999999999,6381.96," see, it's one of the sound, he's pretty bad."
6381.96,6383.599999999999," Soundtrack for, I like,"
6383.599999999999,6384.599999999999, shrek or something.
6384.599999999999,6385.32, I don't know if that.
6388.599999999999,6389.879999999999, That was Smash Melty want.
6389.879999999999,6390.719999999999, Yeah.
6390.719999999999,6392.04, Yeah.
6392.04,6393.16," OK, no."
6393.88,6394.639999999999, So.
6394.639999999999,6395.8," So, so, so Conan."
6395.8,6396.48, Yeah.
6396.48,6398.72," Unless your name is Sean Moeloy, it's a fan of series."
6398.72,6402.16," And DC, the new frontier."
6404.16,6405.16, Seriously.
6405.16,6406.16, That's the thing.
6406.16,6407.16, That's the thing.
6407.16,6408.84, That's the thing.
6408.84,6410.5599999999995, All but I tried out I role.
6410.5599999999995,6413.4, They tried to make comic things about our listeners.
6413.4,6417.639999999999," And if they do this, they're going to come back and like roll the book up"
6417.639999999999,6419.04, and shove it down our throat.
6419.04,6420.5199999999995," DC, the new frontier."
6420.5199999999995,6421.76, It's too volume.
6421.76,6422.96, Have you read the new frontier?
6423.92,6424.52, I don't need to.
6424.52,6426.52, I see that.
6426.52,6427.2, That's how it is.
6427.2,6428.2, That's not going to come back.
6428.2,6431.52, I don't think the new scene is a factory album either.
6431.52,6432.68," Yeah, bird ones."
6432.68,6433.72, I'm going to make you sweat.
6433.72,6434.72, Good.
6434.72,6437.2," OK, but tell us about the new frontier."
6437.2,6439.28," It's a two volume, like graphic novel."
6439.28,6442.92, It was originally published over like six issues or something.
6442.92,6446.32, It's written by Darron written in drawn by Darron Cook.
6446.32,6448.0, And his respectable.
6448.0,6451.28," And it's sort of like this, um,"
6451.28,6454.28, the Dawn of the Silver Age of comics.
6454.28,6458.12, It's like set during like World War II and all this stuff.
6458.12,6460.24," And it chose like a Hitler one, right?"
6460.24,6462.4," No, Hitler did not win."
6462.4,6466.639999999999," And it shows, um, it's sort of like how the green lantern"
6466.639999999999,6468.599999999999, and Martian man hunter.
6468.599999999999,6470.0," How they, how they came to be."
6470.0,6471.8, But it's a good story.
6471.8,6476.28," I always felt like Martian man hunter was one of the more, you know,"
6476.28,6478.759999999999, they couldn't come up with a better name than that.
6478.76,6479.96," That's just a, I don't know."
6479.96,6482.8," It's like, it's like, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's like,"
6482.8,6484.0, villain killer.
6484.0,6485.8, Martian man hunter.
6485.8,6487.2, The entire concept of Martian man.
6487.2,6488.12," It's a, you know, this a,"
6488.12,6490.6," a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a."
6490.6,6494.64," The entire concept of that character is, is very poor."
6494.64,6495.0, Wow.
6495.0,6496.68, So he just needed a better name.
6496.68,6498.280000000001, He should have totally protested.
6498.280000000001,6499.12, Martian man hunter.
6499.12,6499.72, Fuck you.
6499.72,6500.68," Well, you may like,"
6500.68,6501.68, Zion.
6501.68,6502.68, I know.
6502.68,6503.68, Yeah.
6503.68,6505.96," The, the re inventions are, you know, he never know."
6505.96,6507.04," Like, ultimates."
6507.04,6510.04," Like, you can, you take some, like, potentially bullshit characters"
6510.04,6513.44, have had bullshit stories and thousands of theories and you do something cool
6513.44,6514.08, with them.
6514.08,6516.08," Like, hey, maybe they didn't in the new frontier."
6516.08,6517.68, I've been completely lost.
6517.68,6520.88," I bet back in the, in the times when I was reading superhero stuff,"
6520.88,6523.36, I got so lost by the constant reboots.
6523.36,6526.48," I, I just, I became utterly,"
6526.48,6530.0," this interesting, because there were so many crisis in year zero"
6530.0,6533.68," and whatever, I just like, which, which fucking green lantern is this now?"
6533.68,6534.2, Yeah.
6534.2,6534.4, Yeah.
6534.4,6536.88, Haven't changed the two exceptions to the super
6536.88,6540.08," here, like, I, I generally don't read super hero comics."
6540.08,6542.92, They're like two exceptions and it's like the ultimates which is done.
6542.92,6545.12," Now, I mean, it's different people doing it."
6545.12,6548.72," And even that, there was a part of that, the part where they, they were in,"
6548.72,6552.16," they had the scroll saga, the version that I thought that was pretty weak."
6552.16,6555.4400000000005," But that and powers, it powers was great."
6555.4400000000005,6558.96, And powers is not about super here as so much as it's about detectives
6558.96,6562.4800000000005, that end up working with crimes that involve someone with powers.
6562.4800000000005,6565.2," So it's kind of like using it as like a theme at the,"
6565.5199999999995,6566.8, the periphery of it.
6566.8,6571.28, But the problem with so many just for general superhero things is you have this cool concept
6571.28,6575.599999999999," where and when, when, when movie adaptations are made of these, they always start with it."
6575.599999999999,6580.5599999999995," Like, what happens if you take a very real world and you give someone a power in it?"
6580.5599999999995,6583.36," And then it always, but then it's like, well, what are they going to do?"
6583.36,6585.599999999999," And of course, there should be a billion things that they could do."
6585.599999999999,6588.16," I mean, you could just like have endless fun with the concept,"
6588.16,6590.96," but then they go down the dumb route road and it's like,"
6590.96,6594.0," well, there gotta be someone super villain with powers to fight."
6594.0,6595.04, And then what do you do for the sequel?
6595.04,6598.32, Then you had like three more people with powers and three more villains with powers.
6598.32,6601.28," And it's like, like you see this trailer for the new Hulk thing, right?"
6601.28,6605.28," If there was just the new Hulk movie, it was just about like Bruce Banner and he became the Hulk"
6605.28,6606.0, in the world.
6606.0,6607.84, Everything else is as we know it.
6607.84,6611.2, But instead he fights another Hulk that he's just like you could see his ribcage.
6611.2,6613.2," Yeah, but I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, very prove."
6613.2,6615.12," Do you need the counterpoint, right?"
6615.12,6616.24, I don't think it proved that.
6617.12,6622.4," Yeah, and break will is not exactly the quintessential, I mean, it is in a lot of ways of realistic"
6622.48,6624.08," for hero movie, but you lose."
6624.08,6625.28, You lose a few reactions.
6625.28,6629.2," What I'm saying is like, when you have a world where everyone is in tights and"
6629.2,6635.599999999999," as can do these remarkable things, you lose the power that the ability to look at what makes"
6635.599999999999,6637.36, that interesting in the first place.
6637.36,6640.879999999999," And then when you do come up with more concepts like shit, how do we come up with another"
6640.879999999999,6644.4, hero and then you come up with something and you don't even do anything to explore
6644.4,6647.44," the ramifications of it because it's time to move on to the next thing, right?"
6647.44,6651.679999999999, Because there's so many fucking people in tights in your book all you could do is draw like splash
6651.76,6652.88, pages of them like flexing.
6654.72,6657.4400000000005," There's not like, you know, like what happens if there's a mentalist or something,"
6657.4400000000005,6659.280000000001," you can influence people, how would that work?"
6659.280000000001,6664.08," You know, like there's nothing, it's just like more like how what poses you're going to be in"
6664.08,6666.0, when he's in a battle with 50 other superheroes.
6667.200000000001,6668.240000000001," I hate it, stupid."
6670.240000000001,6673.200000000001," But that's why that's why we like, there's things that are like,"
6673.200000000001,6676.8," they're supernatural in some way, like walking dead, zombies are involved."
6676.8,6680.64," But again, walking dead is kind of like the zombie version of what powers is to superheroes."
6681.200000000001,6684.400000000001," It's like setting a world with heroes and it's setting a world with zombies,"
6684.400000000001,6686.08, but it's not about zombies.
6687.4400000000005,6692.0," And then other books like, you know, preacher, there are people with this sort of divine"
6692.0,6696.4800000000005," or, you know, various powers and stuff, but it's not like, well, I'm preacher,"
6696.4800000000005,6700.0, you're also dealing with a guy who's just a brilliant writer too.
6700.0,6704.320000000001," I mean, that his, his dialogue and stuff like that just made it a pleasure to read."
6704.320000000001,6707.52," But that's how it works because he stops and says, what happens?"
6707.52,6711.4400000000005, Say if you got this guy and he has like the equivalent of the word a god or if he says something
6711.4400000000005,6716.080000000001," people have to obey, what is he, when would he use it? What kind of things is he going to say?"
6716.080000000001,6719.84," How is it going to work? You know, like, any, he gets into that sort of thing."
6720.400000000001,6722.400000000001," It makes it fun. I mean, right."
6722.400000000001,6725.280000000001," I mean, but I've read plenty of my public realistic take on that."
6725.280000000001,6730.72," Yeah, and I've read plenty of comics where the, where the idea is going to the concept is good,"
6730.72,6734.320000000001," but the writing falls down, right? You know, where they can't fall through."
6734.320000000001,6734.88," Oh, yeah."
6734.88,6736.32, Great idea is there a diamond doesn't.
6736.32,6741.36," Yeah, there's like a preacher. There's so much more than that. There's the fact that, like, over the course"
6741.36,6744.16," of however many issues it was, it was like 89 or something."
6744.8,6749.6," It was very carefully plotted. And so that the way that all the characters, like relationships"
6749.6,6753.04," with one another develops, I got to be careful because they Anthony hasn't finished it."
6753.28,6760.24," But the way that it's just like, it's just so natural. And it runs its course and everyone's,"
6760.24,6764.16," you know, stories and back stories are just like fully explored and realized and in,"
6764.16,6769.2," like, totally satisfying ways. I mean, so there's a whole lot going on there other than"
6769.2,6773.36, here's someone they need to get their monthly check and they got to find a new way to just
6773.36,6777.84," to buy that page. I always bring up where the 50 people and types, you know, it's like a night"
6777.84,6782.5599999999995, day difference in production and how how the people are going about it. Yep.
6782.5599999999995,6784.5599999999995, Agreed. Agreed.
6786.4,6788.5599999999995," Well, I have to do a thing where I will, we'll trade."
6789.4400000000005,6794.320000000001, You can give me something that I have to agree to read and I give you something.
6795.92,6801.200000000001," All right. If you guys read Usagi, Jim both. This is like, yeah, this is like,"
6801.200000000001,6805.68," there. You guys like that? Because I'm a big Usagi, you're no bofane. I like it. I mean, I'm so"
6805.68,6811.84," spotty. I have not read it from front to back. Like, I've ever once know why I'll pick up a few runs."
6811.84,6816.72, Which is worth doing because it's pretty much one long ongoing saga of this rabbit samurai.
6818.56,6824.400000000001," Wasn't he a character in an injured turtle? Well, that was a brief crossover. Yeah, because those"
6824.400000000001,6829.120000000001, guys are buddies. So he did show up in the injured turtle. Yes. But that's not can. I own the toy.
6829.120000000001,6835.120000000001," Yeah, that's not canon. That's a whole other issue. Yeah. There's another thing that comes"
6835.120000000001,6840.080000000001," up that we were talking about walking dead where the first, um, they the first collection isn't"
6840.080000000001,6845.76, the best and isn't the best indicator of like what the series is a whole accomplishes. And I hate that
6845.76,6851.92," because many great series suffer from that like preachers won. The first collection when I got it,"
6851.92,6856.72," I really didn't know if I was if it was worth yeah, for a follow up. And then it totally,"
6856.72,6861.2, it's like the right. I liked it enough. I did like enough that I wanted to see it through.
6861.2,6865.76," Definitely, but there were moments in those in the first couple. I can't tell where the issue"
6865.76,6870.72," divides are in this first volume. Uh-huh. But there were a few moments, a few panels early on"
6871.6,6876.4800000000005," that felt very clunky to me because they were overly expositional. They were sort of like,"
6876.4800000000005,6880.08," now that we're surrounded by zombies, what are we going to do? Yeah. You know, sort of,"
6880.08,6884.64, just gone to like why you really didn't need that bubble. There's a couple panels that in that
6884.64,6889.84," and walking dead in particular that. Yeah, he cringe, but overall it's like it's beyond that. Yeah."
6889.84,6893.4400000000005," And they get better as you get beyond that book in the same way. For me, preacher like really"
6893.4400000000005,6896.96," takes off by the time I was in the third one, it was sprung. And then there's another series I"
6896.96,6902.24," really like called Blade of the Immortal. And that's the same way with the first collection. It's like,"
6902.24,6908.16," it almost needs to be just stripped away from and rewritten because the guy became such a, I mean,"
6908.16,6914.24," he, he, he, he became an actual storyteller in the course of firing his way out. And it's like,"
6914.24,6917.68," that is kind of there. And it's like, but since that's the starting point, you want to turn someone"
6917.68,6921.52," on to it. It sucks to give someone something and say, just trust me, it'll get better because that's"
6921.52,6926.24," like a pretty horrible way to recommend something. But it's the truth. And in a lot of cases,"
6926.32,6931.2," yeah, I read a lot of series, like even books where, you know, by the time you get to the end,"
6931.2,6935.2, you go back and look at the first one. Sure. How did it get through that when like this is the
6935.2,6938.639999999999, ultimate conclusion. And even the author admits that like I really didn't know where I was going.
6938.639999999999,6942.88," Yeah. That often happened with authors, right? You'll go, they'll go back and discredit their earlier"
6942.88,6948.719999999999," works. I wish Kurtman and would go and redo the entire first book of walking dead. One,"
6948.719999999999,6952.88," another reason is that because they had a different artist, this guy told me more. And then Charlie"
6952.96,6960.400000000001," Adler took over from the second collection forward. So by far, all the work. And a lot of people"
6960.400000000001,6966.08," look at it. I think, I don't know, the look at Toni Morris working. If they don't know much about,"
6966.08,6970.32," I don't know. I actually have an unrefined eye for illustration. There's a couple of pictures,"
6970.32,6974.88," Toni Morris does they are like, man, to really fucking cool, but overall. Yeah, he's not as good."
6974.88,6978.96," Well, that I think that's the thing with him. He's one of those sort of like super-fifcially flashy artists,"
6978.96,6984.4800000000005," at least there where they go, he's got some just recognizable style or it looks cool. And just in"
6984.4800000000005,6989.6," the way that kids respond to like Rob Lifeheld or Todd McFarlane or something in their day. I mean,"
6989.6,6996.4," exactly 100% you know, and go, oh, because compared to like Rob Lifeheld, that Dave"
6996.4,7001.36," Masace Shelley, the guy who did Batman, you're one. Very traditional, very straightforward. And so"
7001.36,7005.44," if you're a kid and you look at it and you're like, dude, there's like five times as many lines"
7005.5199999999995,7009.599999999999, in a Rob Lifeheld thing. He's got like 60 teeth in his mouth. That's got to be better.
7011.599999999999,7016.16," There's like, there's to see every strength of muscle. Yeah, he gets to every sin you and his body."
7016.879999999999,7023.2," Soly better, isn't it? But they're lines. If you have any any idea for for visual storytelling,"
7023.2,7028.32," and for pacing, and just for composition rather than just drawing some some thing that looks"
7028.32,7033.2," stylish, you know, stylistically, you know, cool. But then understanding that you're not just drawing"
7033.28,7038.16," pin-ups that you're communicating a world where when you look at it, you should be able to imagine."
7038.16,7042.8," What would I see if I turned around 180 degrees? What's back here? Like, if this guy is shoved,"
7042.8,7048.08," where's he going to end up, you know? And Adler just is fantastic at that. And he's very like,"
7048.08,7052.96," in a traditional classical sense of things, really accomplished artists. I'd love to see him redo."
7052.96,7057.679999999999," And then some of those lines, and then the writer go in and re-work some of that, like, really clumsy stuff"
7057.679999999999,7061.36," in the first book. Have you read an invincible? I'm just curious if you're right. I thought, yeah,"
7061.839999999999,7065.5199999999995," Darren gave me a collection of that, and that thought it was pretty crappy. Is that the same?"
7065.5199999999995,7071.44," It's a correct way to say, guy. That happens a lot. I mean, it's always demonstrates how"
7072.4,7076.96, symbiotic relationship it is for at least if you're not like a Frank Miller or something where you're
7076.96,7081.04," doing your own stuff writing it and you know, a straightening where you could take,"
7082.16,7085.28," you know, like, Garth and this is another example. There's tons of books that he's done with"
7085.28,7089.12," other artists, or complete shit. Oh, he wouldn't even recommend it. It's not even worth reading"
7089.12,7094.96," if someone gave it to you for free. And it's, it makes a huge difference. I mean, it's definitely a"
7094.96,7101.2," collaborative medium in no, no one guy can carry it. I mean, there are times when maybe you'll buy a"
7101.2,7105.92," book because the arts just so phenomenal, like with Jeff Darrell, I'll do that. I've almost never gone"
7105.92,7111.36," wrong with anything from Alan Moore. Like I started reading all the stuff he started doing again,"
7111.36,7116.72," and God, well, was at the late 90s or early 2000s when he came back with the ABC stuff."
7116.72,7120.88," He's not like, he's not a tough ten and stuff. Hard to hand. I love top 10. This is pretty good at"
7120.88,7126.64," picking who he works with. Yeah, Rob, I felt notwithstanding, but like, you know, when he worked with"
7126.64,7131.6," Campbell from Hell, when he worked with Gibbons for Watchman, it's a very wise choice. It's the"
7131.6,7136.72," right, the guy who did extraordinary gentleman was a perfect fit. I mean, all of us, all those other"
7136.72,7143.04," books top 10, I mean, those Jean Ha, I mean, he's not ending up with like, hey, I'm going to send you"
7143.12,7147.12," my script and you find someone to illustrate this for me, clear that there's an"
7147.12,7154.56, different cultural collaboration. Yeah. Yeah. I'm signaling that I have to go.
7154.56,7158.56," I learned to tell us that. Yeah, I have to go. That's that. I have a meeting. In fact, I'm 20 minutes"
7158.56,7164.72," late for it. Oh, geez. Yeah. You'd make like a pretty bad spire. Somebody who needs to hand signals"
7165.6,7170.16," people on a team. Yeah, I'm not in the secret agent business. Oh,"
7171.12,7174.88," well, maybe this is irrelevant. Maybe you might be covering that up by saying that."
7176.08,7181.599999999999," Right. Well, it's a data here. I'm a double agent. And then you need last words. You look like"
7181.599999999999,7184.72, you had something to say there. Now I'm just pissed that I have to go back to work and Shang
7184.72,7191.12," gets to leave and go Playco. Oh, no. Yeah. I still need stuff to edit now. I got a, I got a big"
7191.12,7199.2," story on DCS's new flight sim. I look up her. And I got the interview from Matt Packelman,"
7199.2,7203.2, I need to put it together in this story. But it's actually pretty cool. It's going to be some
7203.2,7210.4," work. But excellent. This week coming up on on one of that. Come, we have our next pop five, which is"
7210.4,7217.599999999999, going to be a top five botched PC game launches. So look for that. I think Friday. That's going to be up there.
7217.599999999999,7222.639999999999," Oh, and also Tom versus Bruce fans. If your fans of Tom versus Bruce from our magazine,"
7222.639999999999,7227.2, we we've started as of this week. We're going to put them all up online and we put the first one up
7228.0,7233.5199999999995, yesterday. And they're going to go up weekly. I think until they're all there sitting up there in an online
7233.5199999999995,7238.8," archive. And if you are just an online or a podcast listener and have not read these,"
7238.8,7245.04, these are pretty funny. One on one matches that these two guys have every month in our magazine.
7245.04,7249.76," So we're going to go out since like 2003 or look. Yeah. These go back four years, five years."
7249.76,7253.76," Yeah. I get also since it's going up this week. Something else I, I get, I don't get to go and"
7253.76,7259.4400000000005, play. I got to need to prepare to the start for online. But we're putting up a series over
7259.4400000000005,7266.16," that next three weeks of these interviews that we've done in GFW. These aren't the GFW interviews,"
7266.16,7270.88," but these are these comedy pieces. I want to give it all away. But think of, give it away. If I"
7270.88,7277.84," get think of like Christopher guest movies, inspired by that kind of thing. What was their"
7278.72,7283.52," book waiting for Guffman? Guffman. And I mean, they're a spinal tap. That's sort of thing."
7283.52,7288.08," So look for those, those like originally appeared in the magazine. Some new ones are appearing"
7288.08,7291.76, in the magazine. And then they're growing up online. I think a lot of people like overlooked them
7291.76,7296.08, or didn't understand what was happening. And I going back and reread them. I think they're bad
7296.08,7300.96, as they are very funny. Want to make sure they're well worth reading. Yeah. So that's another
7300.96,7307.04, pin. Yeah. Make a sound Jeff for us. We leave.
