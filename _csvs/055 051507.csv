0.0,10.32, Hello and welcome to the GFW Radio Podcast.
10.32,18.02, This is the podcast for May 15th 2007 and I believe if I understand correctly this is not
18.02,22.94, coming out of a whiskey nerd intro this week isn't Sean it's not because you killed
22.94,23.94, that you killed that shit.
23.94,28.14," Oh, I shot his spirit down."
28.14,31.72, All I did was suggest you know we shouldn't do it every week because maybe the readers
31.72,35.34, will like come to expect it and then I'll be disappointed when we don't do it.
35.34,38.3, So maybe now in fact they are disappointed.
38.3,40.3, That's not what happened Jeff.
40.3,41.78, What?
41.78,42.78, What happened?
42.78,43.78, Oh no man.
43.78,45.18, Don't conceal the truth man.
45.18,50.1, I don't know you're saying people they wouldn't want to hear that shit every week.
50.1,52.5, When I said people I meant me.
52.5,55.06," No, I love whiskey nerd."
55.06,58.940000000000005, But just to let it be known it wasn't that I ran out of ideas not by any means.
58.940000000000005,64.10000000000001, Actually showed you this part of the script for one big and I and I walled tonight.
64.10000000000001,65.66, I think you lulled this reading it.
65.66,68.66, I did I lulled just reading it over an Mundo.
68.66,74.78, But I think maybe next week we'll see actually what I want is a a TFW message board thread.
74.78,78.54, We want whiskey or back back sorry who was that that was me sorry.
78.54,79.94, That's damn if they wanted back.
79.94,82.46000000000001," Oh yeah, I didn't want to back that's my vote."
82.46000000000001,83.62, I didn't introduce us.
83.62,87.34, I'm Jeff Green the other and chief with me today is the usual gang.
87.34,88.94, Ryan Scott.
88.94,90.06, Daring last on.
90.06,92.98, Sean Elliott Sean Maloy.
92.98,94.14, Hi everybody.
94.14,95.14, Hello Jeff.
95.14,98.98, We're a little bit we're a little bit cranky here this group today.
98.98,99.98, You know what I mean now?
99.98,101.62, Can we know we're all right.
101.62,102.42, We're all right now.
102.42,104.94, After that's on as the previous.
104.94,105.94, We're a Skinner.
105.94,106.94, Go away.
106.94,107.94, I'm out of here.
107.94,109.66, Now I just find those kids show what we got.
109.66,110.66, We got a lot.
110.66,112.38000000000001," Yeah, you know notice that I have a printout."
112.46,113.61999999999999, So we got to talk.
113.61999999999999,117.02, I was on a we got a lot to talk about this week.
117.02,118.78, I was on I was on one up here.
118.78,120.58, I'm Friday not to toot my own.
120.58,121.58, We don't have to talk about it.
121.58,125.5, I'm just saying reason I brought that up is because when I did the one up here is podcast
125.5,129.9, to get handed to Saul right all of us on the podcast this whole freaking sheet.
129.9,130.9, This agenda.
130.9,131.85999999999999, It's like an Excel file.
131.85999999999999,132.85999999999999, It is.
132.85999999999999,133.85999999999999, It made me feel real.
133.85999999999999,134.85999999999999, It was like got them.
134.85999999999999,136.18, It's because you didn't excel.
136.18,140.06," Yeah, they do but that's because they have so many like specific news items that they"
140.06,141.06, run through.
141.06,141.9, Yeah.
141.9,143.46, So I printed out something for us here.
143.46,144.46, Pretty good.
144.46,145.46, Pretty good.
145.46,147.46," Yeah, it's helping us so hard."
147.46,148.46, It was a tell.
148.46,149.46, Yeah.
149.46,151.46, So I'll follow right on topic.
151.46,152.94, See it's topic one is one.
152.94,154.94," Well, again, I'll never for five minutes."
154.94,155.94, Talk about the list.
155.94,157.94, By talking about that's like the bank comes on stage.
157.94,161.58, So we've got this piece of paper tape behind the speaker over here.
161.58,163.94, It reminds us that we're going to start off with free bird.
163.94,165.94, We're going to follow up with free bird.
165.94,168.26, It's an asshole with the lighter in the air.
168.26,169.58, It has for free bird.
169.58,170.58, We'll play it again.
170.58,171.58, All right.
171.58,173.58," Your organization, not my strong suit."
173.58,176.86," Well, let's, let's get right into a show."
176.86,178.46," We, let's your buff today's book."
178.46,179.46, Guess who's what you're playing.
179.46,180.46, I got better.
180.46,181.46, I like that better.
181.46,184.42000000000002," Man, I feel like it's just pretty straight now for me."
184.42000000000002,185.82000000000002," Now what you, what's that about?"
185.82000000000002,189.82000000000002," You got what you got some some people after your parents, I want to yours."
189.82000000000002,191.66000000000003, You got people that didn't like your voice.
191.66000000000003,193.26000000000002, It was on fit for radio.
193.26000000000002,194.66000000000003," Some, it was one guy."
194.66000000000003,195.66000000000003, One guy.
195.66000000000003,196.66000000000003, One guy.
196.66000000000003,197.66000000000003," Oh, but that's pretty cool."
197.66000000000003,198.66000000000003, I asked on the internet.
198.66000000000003,199.66000000000003, You're right.
199.66000000000003,200.66000000000003, He's been to millions.
200.74,201.78," On his caps though, dude."
201.78,202.46, I agree with you.
202.46,204.1, You have been to one zero one.
204.1,206.22, I think to hear the terrible points with the radio.
206.22,207.22, I think he's.
207.22,208.34," Yeah, I should have said, do you think I'm"
208.34,210.06, an A's or wait till Ryan Scott's on?
210.06,211.06, Yeah.
211.06,212.06, Yeah.
212.06,213.06, That kind of sucked.
213.06,214.06, That bothered me.
214.06,216.06, Will use your kind of a way to talk to the audience.
216.06,218.06, You got the one negative thing.
218.06,222.74," So then I got off the internet and I was like, I went over to, to my wife and my mom"
222.74,225.74," who was staying with us because my mother's saying, so I'm an A's or voice."
225.74,228.82, But I pointed out a lot of my parents are quiet for what?
228.82,229.82, This isn't radio.
229.82,232.57999999999998, This is a bunch of us sitting in like a broom closet.
232.57999999999998,234.06, This is modern radio.
234.06,235.06, Yeah.
235.06,236.06," Oh, it's not modern."
236.06,237.06, I don't know.
237.06,238.06, Whatever you call.
238.06,242.26," But then in addition to that, I mean, it's like distinction is good if you're"
242.26,244.38, going to be on any kind of like audio format.
244.38,246.62," And I mean, Howard Stern sounds like he, you know,"
246.62,252.26," briluppets and brilopeids and I mean, Adam Corolla's got a goosey sound"
252.26,253.1, in voice on the low.
253.1,254.1, It's like right.
254.1,258.34, Do you want to like a suit and tie a personal style of speech as cleaner in the bar
258.34,259.34, of soap?
259.5,262.78," Also, you know, not to name names are pick on anybody, but like, you know,"
262.78,265.41999999999996, Shane has got kind of a nasally voice.
265.41999999999996,269.7, So I have there's nothing like distilled in the nasally voice chair.
269.7,273.02, I guess I was nasal voice for the day.
273.02,278.05999999999995," And then some other guy said, you know, keep the PC gaming nerds off our podcast."
278.05999999999995,278.9, That was another one.
278.9,279.85999999999996, That was another negative.
279.85999999999996,281.9," The long story short, you've learned a lesson here."
281.9,284.58, And that's that stay stay in my place here.
284.58,285.38, Do you have to be that?
285.38,286.78, That's not your role.
286.78,288.21999999999997, I can be nerdy and nasal here.
288.22,289.86," No, no, no, pick on me."
289.86,293.66, That was really when I felt like when a message board kid uses caps.
293.66,295.18, He is critical mass.
295.18,296.5, What is higher world?
296.5,297.5, It is caps on.
297.5,298.18, It's self against you.
298.18,299.5, On my nasal voice.
299.5,302.46000000000004, He did my memory and that's like all the matters he had for fact.
302.46000000000004,304.46000000000004, So that's right.
304.46000000000004,306.94000000000005, As you type code as you type psi.
306.94000000000005,309.14000000000004, I had fun on the podcast.
309.14000000000004,309.78000000000003, Type in size.
309.78000000000003,311.98," Since we're already off track, we haven't even worn out."
311.98,313.66, We haven't even worn out on track.
313.66,315.66, I just need to do a quick rant then to add.
315.66,317.78000000000003," I mean, I added to the ramble."
318.02,321.85999999999996," Well, I've criticized the use of psi and I especially criticized the use of like"
321.85999999999996,323.5," shift date, psi shift date."
323.5,327.58, But I have to add like for the new like Asperger term of the week is like wild.
327.58,328.58," I mean, wild."
328.58,329.9, Where's the shit coming from?
329.9,331.29999999999995," If you're from UK, okay, fine."
331.29999999999995,335.53999999999996," But I mean, like if you're some 13 year old from, I don't know,"
335.53999999999996,337.17999999999995, name some random ass CD.
337.17999999999995,339.09999999999997, Melidus for butt fudge.
339.09999999999997,341.9," And like, and you go,"
341.9,345.94, whilst I agree with the comments at the previous poster.
345.94,348.46," And it's like, you know, they talk like that middle earth."
348.46,351.74," I just said, yeah, they do the talk about that middle earth."
351.74,354.82, I think it's a way to sound a little more intelligent.
354.82,356.1," Well, actually not being."
356.1,356.78," No, it's not."
356.78,358.82, It's another one of those things that's going to like just change.
358.82,359.66, It's a 10% possibility.
359.66,365.7," Like English usage like conjugations for the word bias, like rather than he is biased."
365.7,368.34," Or anything, it's just like you is bias or you are bias."
368.34,369.34, You are tibious.
369.34,373.46," I mean, it's, but no, but I mean, 20 years from now, that will probably be like if you pick"
373.46,376.53999999999996," up like the MLA handbook or something, that will be the proper way."
376.53999999999996,378.02, You can't get by.
378.02,379.02, I think that's going to work.
379.02,385.5," And it's a little replaced while, and then, you know, some, uh, future here."
385.5,387.46, I'm going to turn it back to a while by being a little bit.
387.46,388.29999999999995, And those were the rules.
388.29999999999995,393.46, And like there would be no rules on your and the or any more by now.
393.46,394.74," Ryan, don't contradict my."
394.74,395.74, I'm there.
395.74,400.21999999999997, I think maybe 10 is now part of the common vernacular.
400.21999999999997,401.21999999999997, You think?
401.21999999999997,402.62," No, kind of is."
402.7,405.46," I heard law, I like you'll hear it, law and conversations."
405.46,405.66, Yeah.
405.66,408.86," Because everyone just agreed they're like, we passed the point where law, we're no"
408.86,412.06, and actually thinks that anyone is like legitimately laughing.
412.06,412.58, Right.
412.58,413.58, Right.
413.58,417.62," So you'll say it now in an ironic way, like someone like bombs at a joke and you're like,"
417.62,418.62, law.
418.62,419.62, Yeah.
419.62,423.62," You know, I refuse to actually type law for the longest time."
423.62,427.06," I did not get on the law and land on the wagon because I was like, I'm not laughing"
427.06,428.06, out loud.
428.06,429.06," Oh, not."
429.06,432.3, So I think ha ha ha it's been easier to like just go and.
432.3,436.82, And use that or my mild forced smiles.
436.82,439.7," What I want to say, yeah, MF S, mildly,"
439.7,441.54," me, you said, say it flat out."
441.54,441.9, Say it.
441.9,442.1, Say it.
442.1,442.22, Say it.
442.22,444.34000000000003, Is it my supposed to be laughing or.
444.34000000000003,446.14," Wait, has been over."
446.14,446.66, Forget it.
446.66,447.34000000000003, That's pretty much there.
447.34000000000003,447.86, It's blast.
447.86,448.86," Oh, that's what is."
448.86,449.22, Yeah.
449.22,450.06, It's met.
450.06,450.5, You.
450.5,451.22, It's so.
451.22,451.74, It's a shame.
451.74,453.14, I enjoyed using that one for a little.
453.14,454.34000000000003," Um, okay."
454.34000000000003,456.82, So we're how many minutes and now and haven't talked about shit yet.
456.82,457.82, Eight minutes.
457.82,458.82, All right.
458.82,459.82, Okay.
459.82,461.38, So so much for my type out.
461.38,462.38, Sheet here.
462.38,463.38, I got you back.
463.38,464.38, Okay.
464.38,465.38, So let's bring it back.
465.38,466.38, What's your play?
466.38,467.38, What's your play?
467.38,471.42, The first thing we're going to talk about playing is very.
471.42,472.42, Incruments of halo.
472.42,473.42," Eh, gang."
473.42,474.42, Eh.
474.42,475.42, Eh.
475.42,476.82, There's been a little bit halo to on Vista.
476.82,479.26, We did a little bit of halo three for a few of us here.
479.26,480.26, Right.
480.26,481.26, We did try playing some Vista here in the office.
481.26,485.3, We got up to three people playing because there's so many like online bugs.
485.3,486.3, Right.
486.3,487.78, What happened with that?
487.85999999999996,492.17999999999995," So the deal is the short version is the, there were a lot of upgrades that needed to"
492.17999999999995,498.7, happen to the live service and for for PC and we had connection issues just trying to
498.7,501.14, just try to get a game up and running was with enough of a trick.
501.14,504.7, But we were able to death match on small bits which is fine with three players.
504.7,505.7, Yeah.
505.7,507.73999999999995," I find if you have a, I've heard the name of the maps that we were on."
507.73999999999995,509.82, It was basically the one that's for halo of this.
509.82,511.82, It's a remake of one of the favorite.
511.82,513.9, Draw lots of favorites from halo one.
513.9,514.9, Right.
514.9,515.9, Whatever.
515.9,516.9, Anyway.
516.9,523.02, So we actually had three working Vista machines and here they could play halo to.
523.02,524.02, Yep.
524.02,528.74," And it was cool using that interface to go on, you know, I mean, like all you do is press your"
528.74,533.78, home key and you bring up what you're used to getting when you press your magic X circle key
533.78,534.78, and your 360 control.
534.78,537.5, So it brings up the windows live.
537.5,538.5, Yeah.
538.5,539.9, Very often they're all the stuff that you're used to doing.
539.9,540.9, But you're used to the key and everything.
540.9,543.8199999999999," The one thing that kind of bones me out though about that is it's, it's got a fraction"
543.8199999999999,546.86," of the stuff you could do on like, when you, the same button."
546.86,548.42, Pressing you pull it up on the console.
548.42,550.9, You can do a lot less on the PC.
550.9,553.1, Is that just right now?
553.1,554.1, Right.
554.1,555.1, Right now.
555.1,556.1," I mean, hopefully they're building some more stuff."
556.1,557.1, That's one problem.
557.1,559.54, The other thing is it should be kind of built into the OS at this point.
559.54,563.42," So if I hit the home key or if I could key it to something, even with an in a gamer"
563.42,566.46," not, it kind of calls up that, you know, guide."
566.46,567.86, So I can hook up with people on another game.
567.86,570.5, My understanding is right now you have to actually be in a game.
570.5,571.5, Exactly.
571.5,576.22," You can't run live in the, in the, in the, in the bottom of the taskbar like you would"
576.22,577.22, steam or something.
577.22,578.22," That's, that's exactly what I'm saying."
578.22,580.02, I'm going to go ahead and call that retarded.
580.02,581.02, That's a majorly retarded.
581.02,585.58," Yeah, because how someone in a like, hit you up and say, hey, let's play, what's"
585.58,586.58, a call?
586.58,587.58, Right.
587.58,588.58, What is it called?
588.58,590.9," I mean, they can't because you'd have to be, that's, that's where they can."
590.9,593.62," I mean, technically I guess you would use AOL Institute Messenger."
593.62,596.94," Well, I'm not going to, well, I'm not going to know until I'm not going to know until like"
596.94,599.4200000000001," we get copies of Shadowrunning because that's because the first, at instance, where"
599.4200000000001,604.0600000000001," you're going to see people like on like, basically on consoles on PC trying to hook up"
604.0600000000001,605.0600000000001, at the same time.
605.06,609.66," Maybe there's like something built into like MSN Messenger where you could, if you have"
609.66,611.6199999999999," that running in the background, it'll pop up message."
611.6199999999999,614.3399999999999," But still, it's kind of a, it's hard to, you have to, you have to have a game running"
614.3399999999999,615.3399999999999, in order to like connect up.
615.3399999999999,616.3399999999999, That's all stuff still.
616.3399999999999,617.3399999999999, It'll be all the fix though.
617.3399999999999,619.3," I mean, like, that seems like a no brand."
619.3,620.3, Yeah.
620.3,621.3, I'm not worried about that.
621.3,625.3," I was more worried about when we're playing how it feels like running it exactly, you"
625.3,629.8199999999999," know, running, not performing, but you're physically, you're, you're master chief model running"
629.8199999999999,631.14, in the game.
631.14,634.5799999999999, At the exact same speed as Halo 2 on Xbox.
634.58,637.94, It feels like I'm playing Counter Strike and I got like the walkie glued down.
637.94,640.7," No, I, I was playing the same thing when I was playing the game."
640.7,642.58, Because it's just another one of those things.
642.58,647.34," It's, I mean, so much is based on perception, but with the interface because you're"
647.34,651.1800000000001," able to like mouse looks super fast, you know, so you can whip around and you're used"
651.1800000000001,654.1," to that and you're like, I can look so fast."
654.1,655.34, But why am I like tiptoeing?
655.34,657.7," You know, when you're like, move, motherfucker, move."
657.7,659.58, That's actually the speed that that.
659.58,660.58," With that, right?"
660.58,661.58, But it is.
661.58,662.58, Yeah.
662.58,664.0600000000001," And that's perfectly, and it feels ideal."
664.06,667.78," I mean, that speed is very carefully tuned on the Xbox game."
667.78,671.7399999999999," No issues with it, but because of the difference in the other interface, it really feels"
671.7399999999999,677.9799999999999," like you're crawling through, you're walking through someone's fat mom's ass."
677.9799999999999,679.6999999999999," You know, I got this fit out."
679.6999999999999,681.0999999999999," Actually, I got, I had a correct one thing though."
681.0999999999999,683.9799999999999," It took me to a minor point, but like I noticed this, I noticed the same thing as"
683.9799999999999,687.7399999999999," you and like I plugged in a controller just to see the difference, right?"
687.7399999999999,691.26," So because it's key to an analog stick, you can actually walk versus run."
691.26,692.26," I mean, like it's all relative."
692.26,695.5," It's still kind of going pretty slow, but there's only a max speed."
695.5,696.5, It's still max.
696.5,699.02," Well, it's still max speed, but it's exactly, but it's still cut."
699.02,701.8199999999999," But you, I mean, what the analog just makes it so you can go even slower."
701.8199999999999,702.8199999999999," Right, exactly."
702.8199999999999,703.8199999999999," I mean, it's kind of relevant."
703.8199999999999,707.8199999999999, So you start to appreciate the speed of like a power lock when you're
707.8199999999999,708.8199999999999, exactly.
708.8199999999999,709.8199999999999, But it's just kind of funny.
709.8199999999999,713.78," It's like, they jack, that's the jacking up of their speed."
713.78,714.78, Yeah.
714.78,718.26," But it was interesting to me because it just seemed like when you put it with the controller,"
718.26,719.8199999999999," it's like, oh, this is fine again."
719.82,720.82, But it does the bottom line.
720.82,724.0600000000001, It just seems to me is that this game is ported.
724.0600000000001,728.2600000000001," They took the trouble to port it to this platform, and it's still with an emphasis on the"
728.2600000000001,729.2600000000001, controller.
729.2600000000001,730.7, And it just seemed so weird.
730.7,731.7, I know.
731.7,734.62," And if the emphasis is on the controller, then why did they port it?"
734.62,736.9000000000001," That's what it, that's what it is."
736.9000000000001,739.1400000000001, The textures are flat as hell.
739.1400000000001,743.1," I think I made a mention on the podcast before, but like you watch some of the, you"
743.1,745.1400000000001, walk up to some of the human textures.
745.14,749.38," It looks like a serial killer with a, like a mask on."
749.38,750.38, Yeah.
750.38,751.38, I did that.
751.38,752.38, Okay.
752.38,755.66," No, I mean, every time it comes up, we talk, I mean, we've got melted mannequins."
755.66,756.66," Yeah, sure."
756.66,757.66, Okay.
757.66,758.66, Okay.
758.66,759.66," You know, they need to go into that."
759.66,760.9," The dude from the first craft novel, preacher."
760.9,761.9, Exactly.
761.9,766.06," But also we got so far, not a blue or not overwhelmed by with excitement for Halo"
766.06,767.06, 2 for busted textures.
767.06,771.14," Oh, and here's another thing that I really loved is that the, I mean, you, the, the, the"
771.14,776.14," required game settings is a, you know, on the Windows experience thing index, it's a"
776.14,781.78, 3 out of 5.9 and in order to get it running and it's chuggy at that is a 5 out of 5 out
781.78,782.78, of 5.9.
782.78,783.78, It's a son believable.
783.78,784.78," Wait, 5.9."
784.78,788.18, 5.9 is the max right now for the Windows experience scale.
788.18,791.66," And then I kind of like, it's, I know it's stupid, but it builds over time."
791.66,795.58," So like when the next wave of graphics cards and CPUs come out, it goes from like six"
795.58,800.8199999999999," to have a, have we ever got a real rational explanation out of them as to why."
801.1800000000001,804.0600000000001, There are requirements or so high for this console port.
804.0600000000001,806.1, I have three years ago.
806.1,807.5, I got nothing then.
807.5,811.6600000000001," And that's for especially puzzling too, because again, when I'm like asking what"
811.6600000000001,816.46," is doing on this platform, if you said, they want to attract people that may, may not have"
816.46,820.1400000000001," an Xbox or whatever, but they have a PC that's got reasonable stats on it."
820.1400000000001,823.0600000000001, And then they just get a controller and then they can experience what it's like.
823.0600000000001,824.3000000000001, But I'm talking about reasonable.
824.3000000000001,827.1800000000001," I'm talking about like maybe like, you know, three, four or five year old rig."
827.1800000000001,828.1800000000001, Right.
828.1800000000001,829.1800000000001," Of course, that's not the case."
829.1800000000001,830.1800000000001, Right.
830.2199999999999,834.8199999999999," I mean, a reasonable PC none of us in this fucking room have a PC that can play that."
834.8199999999999,835.3399999999999, Right.
835.3399999999999,837.8199999999999," Well, there and does, but that's the tech guy."
837.8199999999999,841.2199999999999," I've got a, I have a reasonable PC and it still runs kind of as to shut you."
841.2199999999999,842.8199999999999, I'm just scratching my head.
842.8199999999999,846.38," I mean, how is that going to, how is this going to get people to play Halo that only"
846.38,847.38, have a PC?
847.38,848.6999999999999, No one has that kind of PC?
848.6999999999999,850.6999999999999," I mean, they need to dumb this down."
850.6999999999999,852.4599999999999, They need to do like what world of warcrafted.
852.4599999999999,855.66, And I just go lower than everybody's current system.
855.66,858.5," And the funny thing is, which it seems like Halo 2 should have been able to do."
858.5,863.3," So the thing is, like, graphic, the way it looks, it doesn't warrant that performance"
863.3,864.3, last.
864.3,868.7," Yeah, I'd like to hear why I'm sure that there's probably some Microsoft person listening"
868.7,872.1, to this podcast now and hating us and hating that we ever made this.
872.1,873.3, This is what they owe it to.
873.3,879.78," Yeah, we're really like down to respond and tell us for real, why Halo 2 has to run on"
879.78,881.62, this to at these requirements.
881.62,884.78," This is a very topic news you're in, like it's something that we're going to have to put"
884.78,888.46," out there too is that I think a lot of people, especially like died."
888.46,893.5," My heart, you know, committed Halo fans are going to perceive that there's like an inherent"
893.5,900.1," bias among PC FPS fans, you know, that we're just determined to provide against the franchise."
900.1,901.1," Oh, exactly."
901.1,902.1, I want to see it here sooner.
902.1,906.0600000000001," I want to see Halo 3, like we're at least pretty shortly after the console version"
906.0600000000001,907.0600000000001, on the PC.
907.0600000000001,910.6600000000001," And even, I mean, yeah, even though we're constantly talking about how much we play for"
910.6600000000001,913.62," 60, various environments, you know, just like when you're on one up, you're as you're"
913.62,915.46, talking about all the live games and stuff.
915.46,917.46, But that's still there because I think it's general.
917.46,920.86, And you do see a certain kind of show of anism on message boards and what the understanding
920.86,923.46," is is that, okay, here's Guy X."
923.46,926.5, And he's the one who's bias against Halo and he's bias against it because having spent
926.5,932.0600000000001," however many thousands of dollars to play, whatever shooter on his game, he needs to"
932.0600000000001,936.94," convince, he needs to convince himself that he did the right thing and that he can't get"
936.94,941.4200000000001," a superior, you know, experience for a fraction of the price and that the other people"
941.4200000000001,942.4200000000001, would play.
942.4200000000001,945.7800000000001," So they just think that there's like a kind of, you know, mental, a mental acrobatics going"
945.7800000000001,946.7800000000001," on to, to write."
946.9399999999999,952.78," I will clarify then for me anyway for the record, I do not have a bias against this"
952.78,956.86, franchise or against the fact that it's on the 360.
956.86,959.9," Actually, love, uh, bungee."
959.9,963.9, Marathon is might be my favorite first person shooter ever.
963.9,971.22," The myth series was fantastic that they put out in the, what the late 90s."
971.22,976.54," And Halo, one and two on next box, I had a great time with a single player."
976.54,982.66," So the point isn't that we're just trying to bag on this thing by saying, well, PC shooters"
982.66,984.4599999999999, did all this five years ago.
984.4599999999999,990.9399999999999," I mean, it's interesting that they are, I mean, there is like, you know, so, you know,"
990.9399999999999,996.06," contrary to, you know, gamer X, the PC guy in F. Yes, I think there's what I call like"
996.06,1002.0999999999999," the Spartan Gestapo and those are like the most die hard of the die hard Halo, Halo"
1002.1800000000001,1003.1, players.
1003.1,1007.02," And they for some reason can't understand why, for example, a two or three year old"
1007.02,1013.02," game that was basically, you know, designed for an interface for another interface."
1013.02,1014.9," Then, you know, do what we're playing."
1014.9,1019.94, And now it just puzzles them why it still can't be seen as the best bar none.
1019.94,1021.9," Or not a web app, but just like unimpetable."
1021.9,1025.38, It's like say a word wrong about it and you summon the Spartan Gestapo.
1025.38,1028.22," You know, they'll, they'll come out of the woodwork and let you know."
1029.18,1032.8600000000001," I mean, the thing is like playing Halo 2 now for the first time on the PC."
1035.02,1039.26, It just seems like it's doing things like we've already done this in shooters now on the
1039.26,1042.94, PC. And I'm not saying that that's a fault of Halo because it's just a fact that
1042.94,1044.14, Halo's three years old.
1044.14,1045.46," Anyway, you slice it."
1045.46,1045.66, Right.
1045.66,1046.74, It's an old game.
1046.74,1048.46," There's some, I mean, we could talk now."
1048.46,1053.3," I mean, because obviously at least three of us here have been playing Halo 3 beta over the weekend."
1053.3,1054.34, Who else was playing over the weekend?
1054.34,1057.74," Jeff, I was playing and you Darren and Sean Elliott played."
1057.74,1059.14, But I tried to start in Sunday.
1059.14,1061.3," Sean, Malayan, Ryan, you didn't play."
1061.3,1063.14," But you don't have a 360 yet, then you're right."
1063.14,1064.14," No, not part of the clue."
1064.14,1064.78, I wouldn't be playing it.
1064.78,1065.78, It's all I did.
1065.78,1066.78, Why not?
1066.78,1068.18, You don't play shooters?
1068.18,1069.18, You don't?
1069.18,1072.98," You know, I may as well have not played this weekend because man, I got my ask."
1072.98,1073.98, Me too.
1073.98,1078.42," I can say I played, but that's in air quotes because I would log on and then just get shot"
1078.42,1079.42, over and over.
1079.42,1080.42, I want you guys.
1080.42,1081.42, I don't know.
1081.42,1083.42," Actually, you want to have a bad time."
1083.42,1084.42, I don't know.
1084.42,1086.42," The thing was, actually, this is true."
1086.42,1089.8200000000002," We were aiming on Saturday and I'm like, dude, I think I'm going to fire up Halo again,"
1089.8200000000002,1092.18," give it another shot and he's like, don't get frustrated."
1092.18,1093.18, You're going to get your ask kick.
1093.18,1094.98," I'm like, I'm fully expecting that."
1094.98,1098.18, Is anyone starting on this early has a vested interest in Halo?
1098.18,1099.18, Yeah.
1099.18,1101.8600000000001," These are like the guys who are like, you know, they must think, because it's crazy."
1101.8600000000001,1103.8200000000002, I couldn't last for two minutes.
1103.8200000000002,1105.0600000000002, You only joined my survival.
1105.0600000000002,1108.3000000000002, When I was on a server with the EGM guys because they kind of suck.
1108.3000000000002,1109.74, I wanted to play with me.
1109.74,1110.74, They wouldn't play with me.
1110.74,1112.8600000000001," So I ended up playing, like I was with the wolves."
1112.8600000000001,1114.0600000000002, Like in a story office level.
1114.06,1117.02, I'm playing like all like all the way to the above.
1117.02,1117.86, I figured it out though.
1117.86,1118.86, I do.
1118.86,1119.86, I'll write.
1119.86,1123.46," It's not like I'm coming in the top score every match, which is frustrating to me."
1123.46,1126.46," Because there's like, I get used to like wanting that and expecting at least to be in the"
1126.46,1128.34, top two.
1128.34,1132.1799999999998," But like, I held my own against people that were like far, but I mean, no doubt about"
1132.1799999999998,1133.62, there are people that are good.
1133.62,1135.58, They will mess your shit up in that game.
1135.58,1136.58, Quick.
1136.58,1137.58, And it's the beta.
1137.58,1138.58, I don't know.
1138.58,1140.82, But I was somewhere from having some of them been playing.
1140.82,1144.5, I hope some of them had been playing prior to Friday when we got it.
1144.5,1148.1799999999998," I know that the beta had been available because if, if though in the course of Friday"
1148.1799999999998,1152.78," evening, if in the one hour since that code, since I got that code, they got to like level"
1152.78,1153.78, 13 or 14.
1153.78,1154.78, I know.
1154.78,1156.22," That's some, but diarrhea is shocking."
1156.22,1157.22," I mean, that's true."
1157.22,1158.22, That's like true.
1158.22,1159.22, That's diarrhea.
1159.22,1163.86, People knew where all the cool shit was already and had a access all the secret places.
1163.86,1165.26, It was driving me nuts.
1165.26,1168.1," You'll be what you want to do is find for, I mean, there might be a fun."
1168.1,1169.1, I don't know if it's a level of difference.
1169.1,1170.86, I agree to go and explore the map.
1170.86,1173.34, Look where the spawns are for all the things.
1173.34,1177.6599999999999," Mess around with the power up with the, the deployable power up stuff now."
1177.6599999999999,1178.6599999999999, But here's the thing.
1178.6599999999999,1185.4199999999998," I was thinking, if Halo 3, if, if in some, you know, bizarre, alternate world, Microsoft"
1185.4199999999998,1192.6599999999999," actually had, you know, the Gahonez to release Halo 3 for Xbox 360 and PC at the same"
1192.6599999999999,1193.6599999999999, time.
1193.6599999999999,1196.1, We would be psyched about that game.
1196.1,1197.86, I think we would be more excited about it.
1197.86,1203.06," I mean, but it would also would have to be, I mean, again, if they did the same thing"
1203.06,1205.4199999999998," they did with Halo 2 Vista, I wouldn't be so excited."
1205.4199999999998,1208.78, I would want to play it on 360 because it's a controller based game.
1208.78,1211.6599999999999, It's a game designed for a controller and it does that very well.
1211.6599999999999,1213.3799999999999," I mean, it's a standard for that."
1213.3799999999999,1214.3799999999999," Oh, let's say I know you can do that."
1214.3799999999999,1215.3799999999999, You can do that.
1215.3799999999999,1216.3799999999999, You always use a controller.
1216.3799999999999,1217.3799999999999, You need to on the PC.
1217.3799999999999,1219.9399999999998," It's just said, you have to resort to that."
1219.9399999999998,1220.9399999999998, Right.
1220.9399999999998,1222.3799999999999," But at that point, it's like, eh, I don't know."
1222.3799999999999,1224.78," And if someone who has a 360, I might as well play that."
1224.78,1225.78, Yeah.
1225.78,1226.78, Yeah.
1226.78,1227.78, That's how that's how I feel.
1227.78,1230.54," I mean, use a controller or design it for a controller."
1230.54,1232.22, Then I'll play with my controller machine.
1232.22,1235.54," Unless they had options that I couldn't get elsewhere like, I mean, the downside."
1235.54,1236.54, This is all old news.
1236.54,1240.54, They're using the same matchmaking system or an updated version of it that used for Halo 2.
1240.54,1243.74," And it's like, when you want to go in and filter for a game, it's like, I don't want"
1243.74,1249.82, to go in and randomly be thrown into like a rocket's only on some on map wide.
1249.82,1251.02, I think it's a PC shit.
1251.02,1252.02, Right.
1252.02,1253.02, I'm the only one that vetoes it.
1253.02,1254.54," Like, what if I wanted to search specifically?"
1254.54,1255.54, I'm out.
1255.54,1257.02, And that's the downside of matchman.
1257.02,1258.02," At the same time, it's great."
1258.02,1261.46, You're never like sitting in an empty server with a bunch of bots waiting for people
1261.46,1262.46, to join.
1262.46,1267.3799999999999," But there are a few things though, about like, even for a console game, there are a few"
1267.3799999999999,1268.3799999999999, critiques I have.
1268.3799999999999,1269.3799999999999, And this is for both.
1269.3799999999999,1275.1399999999999," I mean, just continue to justify the Halo 3 talk by linking it back to Halo 2 Vista."
1275.1399999999999,1278.94," And one is that visually, it's not very remarkable to me."
1278.94,1281.82, And it doesn't necessarily need to be in the kind of game it is.
1281.82,1282.82, It doesn't really matter.
1282.82,1285.42, But it surprises me because I see.
1285.5,1291.8200000000002," I still see a good deal of like just, you know, I balls pop now their head over it or"
1291.8200000000002,1292.8200000000002, it sounds like it.
1292.8200000000002,1293.8200000000002, I get that.
1293.8200000000002,1294.8200000000002, But haven't had this.
1294.8200000000002,1297.54, There's a bunch of said though that this is they're adding a lot of pretty still in
1297.54,1298.54, the coming months.
1298.54,1299.54, I've heard.
1299.54,1302.0600000000002," Yeah, but I don't think adding particles of stuff is really going to make that much of a"
1302.0600000000002,1305.02, difference because I'm going to argue that it's deeper than that with this game.
1305.02,1306.9, And I got some stuff to say on that real quick.
1306.9,1307.9, But for one.
1307.9,1308.9, For one.
1308.9,1313.14," It's like they, well, I mean, there a video went up recently that's kind of like a walk"
1313.14,1314.14, through of Halo 3.
1314.14,1315.14, It's online.
1315.14,1316.14, Most people have seen it.
1316.14,1317.38, It's on game videos and elsewhere.
1317.38,1320.8600000000001," And as the guys, you know, the the budget employees demonstrating the game, you"
1320.8600000000001,1321.8600000000001, can't click at the water now.
1321.8600000000001,1324.42," We got this river and you know, look, any shoots of guys."
1324.42,1326.14, Don't get me scarted on the water.
1326.14,1327.9," The body, you know, the body floats in it."
1327.9,1328.9, Then it sinks or something.
1328.9,1332.3400000000001," You know, you'll see stuff going down the river as you play and everyone's like,"
1332.3400000000001,1333.3400000000001, it's the game.
1333.3400000000001,1334.3400000000001, But yeah.
1334.3400000000001,1335.3400000000001, But it's the big edge.
1335.3400000000001,1336.3400000000001, He's awesome.
1336.3400000000001,1339.9, There's a un-very un-pc joke that I need to make about game.
1339.9,1340.9, Maybe I won't.
1341.9,1342.9," About the river, Gadgets."
1344.5,1345.1000000000001, Not move on.
1345.1000000000001,1346.5, I'll say it through the rest of the shit.
1346.5,1346.7, OK.
1346.7,1350.7," But so, but the first night I'm in and I'm listening to people that are playing and they're like,"
1350.7,1351.7," oh, I love this."
1351.7,1352.7, I love this.
1352.7,1356.7," You know, and it kind of struck me as the, you ever play a game."
1356.7,1360.3000000000002, You ever play a beta with other people basically that weren't ordinarily have access.
1360.3000000000002,1361.3000000000002, Mm-hmm.
1361.3000000000002,1364.02, And rightfully so it's the same way I remember before I was in the industry.
1364.02,1366.9, I wasn't invited for the ever quest PS2 beta.
1366.9,1368.5," And I was like, oh, ever."
1368.5,1371.1," Yeah, this is an instant right here."
1371.1,1374.3," It actually would like, I loaded that thing up went through the trouble and I was like,"
1374.3,1377.3," my first response was like, I can't seem to get online."
1377.3,1378.3, I did that a few times.
1378.3,1380.7," It took me like maybe a day for I say, fuck this trash."
1380.7,1385.1," But, uh, but no, but, but you're like, OK, this I'm part of something important."
1385.1,1385.7, This is cool.
1385.7,1387.1, I should be like respectful.
1387.1,1389.9," You know, I should be appreciative of the fact that I'm in on this."
1389.9,1392.5," And, um, and they're like, oh, yeah, I love this."
1392.5,1393.7, Just amazing looking.
1393.7,1394.7, It's amazing looking.
1394.7,1395.7," It's like, look at the water."
1395.7,1396.7, You see the water?
1396.7,1400.7," Completely parodying like point by point that video demonstration on game videos is like,"
1400.7,1402.9," watch this, your guy will float in it."
1402.9,1405.5," But again, it's like, OK, the water thing."
1405.5,1406.5, You just bitched about that.
1406.5,1411.3," But it's like, yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, did, I mean, how have like two came out"
1411.3,1412.5," for Xbox one, right?"
1412.5,1415.82," I mean, do you not remember pushing crates in there and shooting them and watching them"
1415.82,1418.1000000000001," splinter and right, bodies go flying in it."
1418.1000000000001,1421.7," It's part of the, like, but possibly just in the demo, the first half like two"
1421.7,1423.3," demos was like, body's floating in the water."
1423.3,1423.5, Yeah.
1423.5,1426.1000000000001," And all of a sudden, but it's just like, OK,"
1426.1,1432.34," you got some water, you know, but I think the complaint about I just, I'm very curious that"
1432.34,1436.78," Halo, when it was originally conceived was conceived of the limitations of Xbox one hardware"
1436.78,1437.78, and mind.
1437.78,1440.62," So when they're designing the world in the aesthetic of the world, they're saying, let's work"
1440.62,1444.62," with this clearly, we're not going to be able to represent an environment that looks like this"
1444.62,1448.58," or this or, you know, like, a Ralph McCory painting from a Star Wars designer or something."
1448.58,1449.82, We're not going to be able to do that.
1449.82,1454.02," So let's take the minimalist, let's create a minimalist aesthetic based on our limitations."
1454.02,1455.02, So they did that.
1455.02,1459.06," But rather than saying, OK, suddenly now we have more hardware power available to us."
1459.06,1464.34," Let's rethink this and say, you know, it'd be like if half life two looks structurally the same"
1464.34,1469.3799999999999," as half life one, you know, where the offices all were basically the same and stuff, you know."
1469.3799999999999,1471.42, And I think it's kind of a curious move.
1471.42,1474.78," I mean, there's definitely a distinct, you know, the world of Halo is definitely the"
1474.78,1476.42, state for it.
1476.42,1480.06," But at the same time, it just seems like it's kind of shackled to it to me at the same time."
1480.06,1485.1, Like these are basically designs that were made for the Xbox one.
1485.1,1486.3799999999999, And there's nowhere to go with them.
1486.3799999999999,1489.06, Now it's set to put more dimples and to put more rivets and stuff.
1489.06,1493.26, Maybe put a little more corrugations in the shiny purple material or make it a little shinier.
1493.26,1496.94," But it's not quite, I mean, and this is the multiplayer maps again."
1496.94,1500.94, There could be some crazy by blowing device in the campaign.
1500.94,1505.06," But Halo 2 is very much that way for me too, over Halo 1, you know, it was like, it was"
1505.06,1506.06, very limited.
1507.06,1510.06, One quick point before you get to before I get to far and I forget it.
1510.06,1514.06," First of all, I think that Halo is originally planned for the PC."
1514.06,1519.06, So I'm just wondering how far along in the process that architecture was laid out for the PC version.
1519.06,1522.06," So I mean, even then it would have still been very limited."
1522.06,1526.06," But I'm just saying, like if you look at a game like planet side, which has very much that same kind of"
1526.06,1528.06, shockable act like you're here as generic art.
1528.06,1530.06," Yeah, I mean, it's so many games look that way."
1530.06,1531.06, Exactly.
1531.06,1535.06," And so I think I think it's, I don't think it was a matter of the hardware arena maps and stuff."
1535.06,1536.06, I don't think it's a matter of the hardware in that case.
1536.06,1539.06, I think it's more just a matter of just kind of like the intentional design.
1539.06,1543.06," But it was designed for, I think it was designed for the hardware."
1543.06,1544.06, It is intentional design.
1544.06,1547.06," No, it's designed for the hardware limitations in mind."
1547.06,1551.06," Well, I think that the textures, like, you know, laced over that architecture might have more"
1551.06,1552.06, more of an impact.
1552.06,1554.06," But it's more than that, it's more than texturing."
1554.06,1556.06, It's actually detailed the architecture models.
1556.06,1561.06," I mean, like if you look at the difference in the structures and years of war or something, for example,"
1561.06,1564.06, we've got cornices and fillyels and all the sorts of elaborate stuff going on.
1564.06,1566.06, I'm not saying the halo needs to be that way.
1566.06,1572.06," Or if you look yet, you know, the materials and stuff in a crisis or other stuff that's coming out now,"
1572.06,1574.06," or even in half life too, which is getting on in years now."
1574.06,1578.06," I mean, at the time on Xbox One, they just polygon count would have limited it."
1578.06,1581.06," They didn't have necessarily, they didn't have the mega texturing techniques."
1581.06,1587.06," They didn't have the various things that Unreal Engine 3 uses that allows them to compress, like massive detail into single, you know,"
1587.06,1588.06, textures and stuff.
1588.06,1592.06," But as you said, like we have no idea what they have in store for the single player."
1592.06,1593.06, Right.
1593.06,1600.06," And so these multi these three multiplayer maps that are out now, who knows, they, you know, they might have just been designed just to show off the weapons."
1600.06,1611.06," And again, it doesn't like, and I mean, this is a nitpick in that it doesn't really matter all that much for a multiplayer game that's based on, you know, the spirit of competition and all that, you know,"
1611.06,1616.06," in the same way that your like Starcraft looks, Starcraft looks like ass, but it doesn't matter."
1616.06,1622.06," It's like chess at this point, you know, you're not going to criticize and putting too much detail on the chess pieces and doing anything."
1622.06,1626.06," But not that, I mean, Halo is definitely not chess or anything, but you can make that argument."
1626.06,1633.06," Another, there are other things that bother me right now. One, and this, you could fix is that on the beta, it's a radar only."
1633.06,1635.06, You can't turn that off in the way that you would normally.
1635.06,1637.06, And that's just crazy to me.
1637.06,1642.06," I mean, as for one, when I play, I always have to readjust and say, shit, I got to look at this radar on the corner."
1642.06,1643.06, I'm so not used to doing that.
1643.06,1650.06," It's like an Athamado PC shooter because it basically amounts to like, like a low end wall hack, you know,"
1650.06,1655.06," and it's also most of the sense of, so if you're, if you're finding a nice camping spot and you hide this, oh, it's a motion center."
1655.06,1656.06," Yeah, I think you could try to use it."
1656.06,1657.06," Yeah, I think you could try to use it."
1657.06,1658.06, You could try to use it.
1658.06,1659.06, You could try to use it.
1659.06,1664.06," And you'll, you'll disappear in a bad explain to a lot of, I mean, I would have got frag now."
1664.06,1665.06, It's not going to change anything.
1665.06,1667.06," No, I wasn't going to change my frag camp, but still."
1667.06,1673.06," But what you're, for me, I mean, it is, it is a, it is a, in a group part of the way that people are used to playing that game."
1673.06,1675.06," For me, I just can't stand it."
1675.06,1676.06, It's like you could figure it out.
1676.06,1677.06," You're like, oh, look at that."
1677.06,1679.06, You just quickly into it where they're at.
1679.06,1683.06," So Ricochet grenade around a corner boom, I get a kill because like, I saw them."
1683.06,1684.06, I just don't like that.
1684.06,1689.06," And I, you know, I don't like the grenades coming at me that way or like, so you're both,"
1689.06,1691.06," when you're both like, no, it's not cheap at all."
1691.06,1694.06," This is your both, you both had the building, you both had the limitation."
1694.06,1700.06," But it's just like, that's something that, that I assume we're going to be playing this beta from now until September,"
1700.06,1702.06, whenever when they release Halo 3.
1702.06,1705.06," And I thought it was, I thought it was, I thought it was a little bit more limited."
1705.06,1708.06, I thought it was just a few weeks of spada.
1708.06,1709.06, I could be wrong.
1709.06,1711.06," Oh, that they're going to turn off on it."
1711.06,1712.06, I have no idea.
1712.06,1713.06, Maybe set it up.
1713.06,1714.06, I don't know.
1714.06,1718.06," But I mean, it's like, if I'm going to be playing all that time, I'd like to, to be able to turn that off."
1718.06,1721.06," You know, I actually had no, no, there's a lot more I wanted to say about."
1721.06,1722.06, I made a weekend though.
1722.06,1726.06," It's Halo 3, which isn't coming to the PC until 2000 and well, the 80."
1726.06,1727.06, That's true.
1727.06,1729.06, That's true.
1729.06,1730.06, Not that we're better.
1730.06,1733.06, It'll be coming to Microsoft Bob too.
1734.06,1741.06," But when you guys go back and play the tip and for the other people that had their crackdown codes, probably playing tonight right or the 16th or 16th or 16th."
1741.06,1742.06, I think of.
1742.06,1749.06," Oh, and for the head, like I guess some people did that a lot in Halo 2, but I just for some reason I never figured out that that was that important in it."
1749.06,1753.06," And I would just sort of let the auto, the sticky aim do it, just do center mass."
1753.06,1760.06," But in this one, the moment I figured out go directly for head and all circumstances, like a massively massively improved my odds and fire fights."
1760.06,1762.06, I'm just playing this Halo 3 beta.
1762.06,1766.06," I mean, the game isn't even out yet and it already feels like going into counter strike."
1766.06,1768.06," You know, it's like if you're not in the expert."
1768.06,1769.06," Yeah, forget it."
1769.06,1776.06," There's such a dedicated like, I mean group of fans for that game and I assume that those are all the ones that were led in on the beta outside of the press."
1776.06,1778.06," Yeah, and that's who you're playing it."
1778.06,1779.06," I mean, it's going to be different."
1779.06,1780.06, It's a matter of waiting.
1780.06,1786.06," But yeah, I don't think I honestly believe like there's some people that will never be able to match those guys."
1786.06,1789.06," Like it's not like if you practice for like, I know I never want to."
1789.06,1794.06," You're not going to and it's like you're always going to, I need to find like, and you know, and senior citizens."
1794.06,1797.06," I do need to bring this up because this is, I remember it."
1797.06,1799.06, Here's for and it goes for Halo 2 because so much of it.
1799.06,1804.06," I mean, there are team-based actions in the game, you know, but I don't know."
1804.06,1809.06," I don't get the same sense of like, like, if I'm playing battlefield or something and I help the team or you do something from the team,"
1809.06,1817.06, which you're not necessarily the top score individually or the ability to be a top score without actually having to do a bunch of like hardcore fighting.
1817.06,1822.06," It's not necessarily how I play, but I know that a lot of people will play it and enjoy it that way, you know."
1822.06,1829.06," There's less of that opportunity in Halo, but the other complain I have about the series is that they basically decided to create Jack of all trades maps."
1829.06,1837.06," So rather than say, this is going to be CTF map, or this is going to be a territorial domination map or a murder ball map, odd ball in the game."
1837.06,1842.06, They basically create one map and then they have to chew or and all these into it.
1842.06,1849.06," And of course, they do a fair job of that, but you're always going to have circumstances in which map is just could have been better,"
1849.06,1851.06, many people related for the mode you're playing.
1851.06,1856.06," So for example, a lot of the maps that you're playing now, you'll see ATVs, four wheelers and vehicles and stuff."
1856.06,1868.06," And I would say they're almost there exclusively for CTF, you know, for flag running or for quick access to territories or something or like in something that's time sense of like, you know, odd ball."
1868.06,1878.06," You might be able to find some justification, but they really are death traps in my opinion in the game, but but when you're playing it on the player, if you try to drive them upstairs, like I was."
1878.06,1886.06," But if you're playing like slayer teams there, it's like, okay, why is there this beach on this map so far away from all the action or why is there this back area?"
1886.06,1897.06," I mean, I don't know, I personally prefer like the way that team fortress did it where, you know, they would have like a variety like it was a push pull map, if it was territory, whatever it was like the map was designed just for it."
1897.06,1910.06," And the end it means that you have to make a lot more maps to get the same, you know amount of stuff, but I did find something that I didn't play that when I played when I played with EGM Friday night, and we did one round of is a called King of the Hill on on a what is called there."
1910.06,1911.06, Yeah sure.
1911.06,1924.06, That like I had a lot of experience in battlefield in the old days and in other games like that of not doing the killing base objectives right and of scoring up big points for that because that's great for people like me.
1924.06,1937.06," Who's suck so what I found in playing with those guys is they were all totally like still keep on dragging each other and so I just was Matt Matt you know, racking up massive points doing the."
1937.06,1943.06, That's how that that works though because it's like say if someone's holding the ball right on on on on on bottom all of something.
1943.06,1958.06, And all there is to do is to kill the other guys so that they have a diminished chance of killing your ball or tear or for staying up to the helm get the hit control right but you want to kill them so that they don't kill you and take over a hill it's always like a kill it's not like there's classes it's not like you're going to be.
1958.06,1970.06," No, I wasn't like the and the last thing I wanted to note is that they had those deployables now you get a shield and that you basically picked that up and you drop it but the bubble shield around you there's a jump pad."
1970.06,1980.06, None of it's really exciting or you know or unique to the game I'm when they exist in various you know with under various other guys is another shooters and stuff but one thing that's curious to me is that.
1980.06,1986.06, They have these spawned it out in the world in the way that you'd have an over shield or invisibility or something power up power ups now.
1986.06,1996.06, If you're playing CTF and a map like blood culture something what I want to do is why not have them in your base so that your team is able to say okay we each have one shield we have one jump thing.
1996.06,2002.06, Who's going to take it and where are we going to use it so you're like okay we need to capture territory for but it's wide open a sniper fire.
2002.06,2014.06, Bobby G is grabbing the shield he's getting at the flag and a deploy it and then we're all going to move in and stay under that shield that's where the shield is going to use instead of like oh shit it's so grab a shield did you go out and find where the shield spawn.
2014.06,2028.06, You know I mean I don't know like that's another nitpick but and it's a beta too maybe they'll change that but that would be a cool mode at least offer people the opportunity to spawn a select number of those power ups with a symmetry in either teams base.
2028.06,2034.06, Okay so that enough hail three it's a no-hey we're sorry to everybody who doesn't give a shit. Yeah.
2034.06,2039.06, But it's too late but it's too late we're not in a second minutes of the podcast.
2039.06,2045.06, We have that and we still have an left section one we have a left section one let's segue to section two.
2045.06,2050.06, What you we have numbered sections. We're still we're still we do.
2051.06,2057.06, I'm I'm gonna skip right over my what to plan because it was a Xbox live arcade ball effects again.
2057.06,2058.06, Sean yeah.
2058.06,2059.06, You got nothing.
2059.06,2064.06, Yeah I wasn't playing you take a lot of PC break low gaming break took of being at home break.
2064.06,2067.06, That's a good thing always a good break to take.
2067.06,2068.06, Well and and run.
2068.06,2071.06, And you you just finish something you would quite a bit.
2071.06,2074.06, I've been playing salmon max all weekend.
2074.06,2076.06, You finished the whole thing.
2076.06,2082.06, I did I just actually finish the last chapter of season one right before coming up here.
2082.06,2084.06, Which is chapter what?
2084.06,2085.06, Chapter six.
2085.06,2088.06, Okay so you were you were giggling at your PC all day.
2088.06,2090.06, Yeah.
2090.06,2091.06, Yeah.
2091.06,2092.06, Giggling all the school girl.
2092.06,2094.06, All the time all the tinder.
2094.06,2097.06, And you're you're verdict.
2097.06,2103.06, I think that those games are really good but I think they're a lot more fun when you plan.
2103.06,2105.06, Back to back.
2105.06,2106.06, Yeah.
2106.06,2107.06, Yeah.
2107.06,2112.06, Which one did you play like when they came out and which one did you play a continuous?
2112.06,2119.06," I played episode one and episode two when they came out and over since Friday I played episode three, four, five and six."
2119.06,2124.06, So what what made it better for you to do it in sequence?
2124.06,2126.06, I'm not really sure.
2126.06,2128.06, I was just the continent.
2128.06,2129.06, You have the story on the way.
2129.06,2130.06, I think so.
2130.06,2131.06, Yeah.
2131.06,2134.06, I mean I was kind of trying to explain this to Sean earlier.
2134.06,2140.06," But like when you play him a month apart or whatever, you know you're like oh here's the same jokes again."
2140.06,2143.06, You know the same for turning jokes.
2143.06,2149.06," But when you plan back to back back, you kind of like look forward to those jokes more."
2149.06,2150.06, I don't know if it makes me sense.
2150.06,2152.06, So it's kind of the art of the right it does.
2152.06,2154.06, The art of the running gag is opposed to just swinging it along.
2154.06,2157.06, Well it's like they have the joke about the Ganges River.
2157.06,2161.06, No no I don't think they're still.
2161.06,2165.06," Oh yeah, I mean directly to say it because they might want to include this in the next one."
2165.06,2168.06, But it's the best part if you heard about Ganges coffee.
2168.06,2169.06, Yeah.
2169.06,2170.06, What about it?
2170.06,2176.06, You have to say it in a stereotypical accent which I won't use but the best part of waking up is Grandpa and your cup.
2176.06,2178.06, Oh man.
2178.06,2179.06, Oh man.
2179.06,2183.06," Come on dude, I'm prepped it."
2183.06,2185.06, It's a little bullshit.
2185.06,2187.06," All right, Ryan is that back in there."
2187.06,2188.06, Back to salmon.
2188.06,2189.06, Yeah.
2189.06,2190.06, Okay.
2191.06,2192.06, So yeah.
2192.06,2194.06, We can't salmon max.
2194.06,2195.06, Good.
2195.06,2196.06, Thumbs up.
2196.06,2197.06, Thumbs up.
2197.06,2200.06, It definitely gets better toward the later half of this year.
2200.06,2201.06, Yeah.
2201.06,2203.06, Does it does it wrap up satisfyingly.
2203.06,2204.06, The end.
2204.06,2205.06, Set chapter six.
2205.06,2206.06, It does.
2206.06,2208.06, There's actually an ongoing story.
2208.06,2210.06, It doesn't seem like it at first.
2210.06,2215.06, But how would you put this compared to the original salmon max game?
2215.06,2218.06, Is it in it's it in that it's that league?
2220.06,2225.06, It's it's not I can't I can't say that it's good as the original salmon max.
2225.06,2226.06, And that game.
2226.06,2228.06, But it's good enough to stand on its own though.
2228.06,2231.06," It is. I mean, yeah, you don't you don't have to."
2231.06,2232.06, Maybe original.
2232.06,2240.06, How about how about today's gamer who maybe necessarily hasn't played a adventure game either before or maybe in years.
2240.06,2244.06," I think these these games are a lot more accessible than you know, like the old school Sierra,"
2244.06,2246.06, with a soccer adventure.
2246.06,2247.06, Why?
2247.06,2249.06, They don't make you feel stupid.
2249.06,2250.06, Are they easier?
2250.06,2251.06, Yeah.
2251.06,2256.06, Like I think I was maybe once once in a half maybe it was stumped.
2256.06,2258.06," I mean, five episodes I played."
2258.06,2260.06, I think they get a little tougher as they go along.
2260.06,2263.06, I think episodes five and six notes of the.
2263.06,2268.06," Yeah, I only played episode one and I found that the puzzles so they had the think about a little more."
2268.06,2276.06, Ultimately did have like a straight up logical solution as opposed to like the kind of goofy logic of the old
2276.06,2277.06, game.
2277.06,2278.06, Yeah.
2278.06,2283.06, Where it was like you couldn't just think what wouldn't you couldn't if you thought how would this work in the real world.
2283.06,2285.06, There's no way you would solve the puzzle.
2285.06,2286.06, Right.
2286.06,2288.06, You had to think you know in like cartoon logic.
2288.06,2289.06, Which is a kind of a thing.
2289.06,2291.06, It was a kind of a cartoon logic though.
2291.06,2292.06, There was still so part of it.
2292.06,2302.06, There was but in the old games I know in like the game has to have some logic whether it's like real world or it's like it has to be a consistent logic otherwise you're just like.
2302.06,2304.06," I mean, how do you figure anything out right?"
2304.06,2317.06," Well, in the old games there was would always be at least one puzzle where I would I'd be forced to go to the walk through and I didn't just go oh my god there's knowing oh hell I would have ever got that and you're just every time combining a few items in your inventory."
2317.06,2318.06, That's always the trick.
2318.06,2323.06," Yeah, I was supposed to combine the honey with comb with string okay."
2323.06,2326.06," Yeah, that was supposed to be something right compass."
2326.06,2327.06, Right.
2327.06,2331.06," But I didn't find any of those really and well, I only played episode one of."
2331.06,2332.06, Right.
2332.06,2339.06, I think like the most of the puzzles seem pretty much on par with like you know not early spoiler but using the gun to shoot a hole in the cheese kind of thing.
2339.06,2341.06," Yeah, it's kind of like."
2341.06,2342.06, They get super harder than that.
2342.06,2344.06, They get harder than that but it follows that kind of like logic.
2344.06,2347.06, I think it does follow a more logical thread than previous.
2347.06,2355.06, The first puzzle that like locked me for a while was the one where we put the drop the folding ball and the guy said that.
2355.06,2357.06," That's what I did and I was like, oh duh."
2357.06,2361.06, That's one of the things that occurred to me immediately like there's I look out the window I see this dude.
2361.06,2363.06, I have this bowling ball.
2363.06,2365.06," Well, I so you figured it out on a new next."
2365.06,2370.06, I kept like banging him on the head with the bowling ball right right up front.
2370.06,2375.06, I mean right while he was there and it would always say he would turn around as you were doing and saying I see you.
2375.06,2377.06, So I knew I was on the right track.
2377.06,2378.06, Right.
2378.06,2381.06, I knew that it I was supposed to hit him with this but from a distance.
2381.06,2386.06, And they do and they do telegraph like when you're on the right track but screwing up.
2387.06,2390.06," Yeah, I told you that like yeah use that but use it a little differently."
2390.06,2391.06, So a lot.
2391.06,2394.06, So probably you're right probably a little more forgiving.
2394.06,2396.06, He's done the old ones.
2396.06,2400.06, Never never hard enough to make you really frustrated never.
2400.06,2403.06, So you need that you feel insulted.
2403.06,2406.06," You know, pretty much kind of just right."
2406.06,2411.06, So are they going to sell it now is one whole thing or they are.
2411.06,2412.06, They are.
2412.06,2413.06, Yeah.
2413.06,2421.06," Yeah, it's going to have all six episodes going to have all the little animated clips that came out with community episodes."
2421.06,2425.06," Um, I don't know probably some other extra stuff."
2425.06,2427.06, Do you want to do you're going to play it?
2427.06,2429.06," Yeah, I should be playing it on game tab."
2429.06,2431.06, I'm still like.
2431.06,2435.06, In that position with what the PC that can have one game on a time.
2435.06,2437.06, Maybe it'll be salmon max all the tonight.
2437.06,2440.06, I'm tempted to do a lot of the rings online a long last.
2440.06,2441.06, That's a.
2441.06,2442.06, It's got a large install.
2442.06,2443.06, It's a large install.
2443.06,2445.06," Yeah, I just I'm just committed to take off."
2445.06,2446.06, I'll take off.
2446.06,2447.06, That's a good five gigs on there.
2447.06,2448.06, I think wow.
2448.06,2451.06, So a lot of the rings online is actually invested at sway into your brain.
2451.06,2453.06," Because Ryan, this is because my friend Rory's playing it."
2453.06,2455.06, And I play games with him and he's griefing it like crazy.
2455.06,2457.06, He's got some really good stuff going.
2457.06,2459.06, He's not actually playing it.
2459.06,2460.06, He's he's griefing.
2460.06,2461.06, Yeah.
2461.06,2462.06," Well, right."
2462.06,2463.06, That's playing.
2463.06,2464.06, You're right.
2464.06,2465.06, I'm in the big.
2465.06,2466.06," No, I agree for that."
2466.06,2470.06," Well, collecting like until you can come up with some better shit and collect 35 of these or 40 of five"
2470.06,2473.06, of those fucking things or kill 100 of those.
2473.06,2475.06, Then I'm going to go and fucking.
2475.06,2478.06, The same as you and your stupid flute.
2478.06,2480.06, I talked about this on a 100 person.
2480.06,2481.06," Yes, I know."
2481.06,2482.06, I do agree for Lord of the Rings online.
2482.06,2483.06, Yeah.
2483.06,2484.06, You admitted it.
2484.06,2485.06, I did.
2485.06,2487.06, And when I paste you the aim of the stuff he's telling me he's doing.
2487.06,2488.06," You're like, all right."
2488.06,2489.06, All right.
2489.06,2490.06, I told you on the aim today.
2490.06,2491.06, I was playing on the phone.
2491.06,2492.06, Sounds more fun.
2492.06,2493.06, I nearly went to the question.
2493.06,2494.06, I asked.
2494.06,2495.06, Yeah.
2495.06,2496.06, I think about what's more fun.
2496.06,2499.06, Some of you need a pet of your own that lures like 40 enemies to it.
2499.06,2502.06, And then dragging the pet over to some other bystanders and then
2502.06,2505.06, dispelling the pet so that all the mob just attacks the other dude.
2505.06,2507.06, And then you running off.
2507.06,2511.06, But signaling out the people with the undefeated or unbed or whatever thing.
2511.06,2514.06, Like or or go collect 15 mushrooms.
2514.06,2515.06," Of course, griefing wins."
2515.06,2517.06, I don't know if it would be fixed pretty soon.
2517.06,2518.06, Yeah.
2518.06,2521.06," If the developers made that as a mission, we don't want to have to do it."
2521.06,2522.06, Yeah.
2522.06,2523.06, You're right.
2523.06,2528.06, It is fun to watch the undine guys start whining in the chat channel that's longer undine.
2528.06,2532.06, I just like just like typing stupid shit in the chat window just a piece of
2532.06,2534.06, people off because this has the most like.
2534.06,2540.06," I mean, people goof off in this game, but more than any other MMO game I've seen people"
2540.06,2542.06, like not very humorous about.
2542.06,2544.06, I got a hero the web that's really interesting.
2544.06,2545.06, They really need to break out of this.
2545.06,2546.06, They're like our people.
2546.06,2547.06, Yeah.
2547.06,2552.06," Like I said, I said, you know, looking for a group to kill Tom Bombadil because"
2552.06,2555.06," his prancing and singing is pissing me off, right?"
2555.06,2559.06," It's an obvious joke and there were a few L.O.L.s I got, but you know, some guy, you know,"
2559.06,2563.06, did it tell to me and it was like that's what he spelled T-A-H-T.
2563.06,2566.06," That's sacralid, what he spelled, you know,"
2566.06,2575.06," it's like first of all, you can't kill him."
2575.06,2577.06, So I was obviously kidding.
2577.06,2578.06, It's impossible to grieve him.
2578.06,2579.06, He's an NPC.
2579.06,2580.06, He's like second.
2580.06,2583.06, It was a thought crime.
2583.06,2585.06, He even had typing.
2585.06,2586.06, It was just typing.
2586.06,2587.06, It was a thought crime.
2587.06,2588.06, It's a thought crime.
2588.06,2591.06," And then the other thing I was today was, and I mean, that was you."
2591.06,2592.06," I pissed you off, Sean."
2592.06,2593.06, I'm sorry.
2593.06,2594.06, You're still crying.
2594.06,2596.06, Do you run into characters from the books?
2596.06,2597.06, Yeah.
2597.06,2598.06, You do.
2598.06,2599.06, That was ship.
2599.06,2602.06," So far, I mean, you run into Ergon."
2602.06,2603.06, Is it so far?
2603.06,2605.06, I think the movie Ergon?
2605.06,2607.06," No, they don't have the movie license."
2607.06,2610.06, You should complain about how the characters don't look enough like in the movie.
2610.06,2612.06," No, like in real life as well."
2612.06,2616.06, But they probably like picked the hairstyle that went in the ring.
2616.06,2617.06, Yeah.
2617.06,2618.06, Yeah.
2618.06,2622.06," The other thing I did today was I said, I said, hey, guys, I just found the one ring."
2623.06,2625.06, And I sold it to a vendor.
2625.06,2628.06," You know, it doesn't get more stupid."
2628.06,2630.06, That's hardly humor.
2630.06,2632.06," That's not even, you know."
2632.06,2636.06," And yet some guys still, like, you know, bullshit."
2636.06,2640.06," He's like, no, it's really, really."
2640.06,2641.06, Yeah.
2641.06,2642.06, That's bullshit.
2642.06,2643.06, Really.
2643.06,2645.06, That's good.
2645.06,2646.06, That's good.
2646.06,2647.06, Okay.
2647.06,2650.06, So I do encourage you to install because you'll probably have a lot of fun.
2650.06,2655.06, I did that even all the way back in my first experience with that kind of game was fantasy start online.
2655.06,2658.06, And if you can call for player game and MF.
2658.06,2660.06," But like, you know, you go in the lobby."
2660.06,2662.06, Maybe there's 20 people in your town.
2662.06,2664.06," Like, hey, I got the egg blaster or something."
2664.06,2666.06, And I want to give it away to one lucky player.
2666.06,2667.06, And then you just do the usual.
2667.06,2670.06," You go, like, so you drop into a world with three people that want to do it."
2670.06,2671.06," And you say, all right, you guys all stand out here."
2671.06,2674.06, I'm going to drop it in a spot.
2674.06,2675.06, And then we're going to start the race.
2675.06,2677.06, And the first one in gets it.
2677.06,2680.06, And then it'll just drop like a dollar is whatever they call the mayor.
2680.06,2684.06," And then, uh, I mean, just a bit routinely just do stuff like that."
2684.06,2687.06, So I want to I want to bring it to the world of the Lord of the Rings.
2687.06,2689.06, Yeah.
2689.06,2690.06, I encourage that.
2690.06,2692.06," We, uh, let's people see it."
2692.06,2695.06, Just also played a little of an armor.
2695.06,2697.06, Formally known as arm to salt.
2697.06,2698.06, Because arm is so much easier to understand.
2698.06,2699.06, Yeah.
2699.06,2700.06, What arm is that at all?
2700.06,2702.06, I want to get my arm at home.
2702.06,2706.06," I mean, of course, if it was called arm to salt, we'd be making fun of that too for having such a"
2706.06,2707.06, good.
2707.06,2708.06, Right.
2708.06,2709.06, That's at least neutral.
2709.06,2710.06, Yeah.
2710.06,2711.06," So basically, these guys can not win."
2711.06,2712.06, Armah.
2712.06,2716.06," But this is actually, I mean, this is got, this is promising to me."
2716.06,2717.06, I talked before about like track.
2717.06,2719.06, I are functionality for it.
2719.06,2721.06, So I got around the plane.
2721.06,2723.06, Did you know the training and stuff that then did some of the missions.
2723.06,2724.06, And this is actually cool.
2724.06,2725.06, It's a game.
2725.06,2726.06, It's a battlefield style game.
2726.06,2728.06," But of course, much more similar like far more."
2728.06,2731.06," And also very, very European."
2731.06,2734.06," Whereas, of course, die in Sweden makes."
2734.06,2738.06," There are also your pain in the make battlefield, but they make a game that's, it's got"
2738.06,2741.06, that definitely bears the EA brand on it.
2741.06,2743.06," This, not so much."
2743.06,2746.7," It's clearly like, okay, no one is going to like sweat you guys over whatever interface you come"
2746.7,2747.7, up with.
2747.7,2751.2999999999997," And even if like you have to like reinvent the wheel for every single thing you do, whether"
2751.2999999999997,2754.82, it's like siding down your scope or looking or anything.
2754.82,2759.18," But that said, like, I was like, okay, you know, I'll just take the mental challenge of having"
2759.18,2760.18, to relearn a game.
2760.18,2763.86," Instead of like, you know, you go into shooter and you're like, why is your fucking tutorials?"
2763.86,2767.06, You're still just experiencing the first guy damn.
2767.06,2769.86," She, oh, put on the right trigger makes me shoot."
2769.86,2771.06, What do you know?
2771.06,2772.86, But try ducking under this log.
2772.86,2774.86," Yeah, that was one shoot."
2774.86,2775.86, And what across the board.
2775.86,2778.86," And so you think you're like, okay, it's going to do that."
2778.86,2781.86," And then it starts off, you know, of course you're running off course and stuff."
2781.86,2784.06," You know, just it's to learn how to sprint crawl stuff."
2784.06,2788.86," But after that, then it's when you play single player, you can issue, you know, really"
2789.86,2793.86, get a precise commands to the the soldiers that are in your squad.
2793.86,2798.86," I mean, if you're in a tank, you could choose to drive it, operate the gun or be a commander where it's kind of interesting."
2798.86,2803.86," It's like you're indirectly driving it, you're driving it through, they're giving orders to the crew and stuff."
2803.86,2807.86," But it's, I mean, once you get used to it, I'm seeing a lot of promise."
2807.86,2811.86," I mean, and mainly because you can, the mission editor just seems like really cool."
2811.86,2816.86, You could do basically put together whatever scenario you want and go play it cooperatively online with with friends.
2816.86,2821.86, Or the single player can be much more than battlefield where it just throws bots into maps through multiple player maps.
2821.86,2827.86," It basically takes and, you know, that's, you know, scripting and dialogue and creates like a series of encounters through it."
2827.86,2836.86," And it's definitely, I mean, if you want a really PC centric shooter, it's buggy and the interface is going to like annoy you as you're easing your way into it."
2836.86,2838.86," But I don't know, I think I'm liking it."
2838.86,2841.86," So far, I could see myself coming converted to it quickly here."
2841.86,2845.86," Well, these are the guys who created Operation Flashpoint, which basically was battlefield before there was a battle."
2845.86,2849.86," So I mean, it just kind of like an evolution of what they started and I totally agree with you."
2849.86,2857.86," And I was having a, I mean, I'm still kind of like, mired in the tutorial stuff, but it's complex, but I think it's, it's a little rewarding at the same time for getting through it."
2857.86,2860.86, We gave Operation Flashpoint game in the year back in the day.
2860.86,2864.86, And I got to remember to bring my truck iron and play.
2864.86,2866.86," Oh, yeah, I wonder how that works out."
2866.86,2868.86," Oh, I see it all the, yeah, you can see me gippin' out."
2868.86,2870.86, I'll have to put it a talk about that shit so much.
2870.86,2871.86, I want to see you all the other day.
2871.86,2875.86," I'll put a video up online page, walk down market, street and San Francisco with that thing on."
2875.86,2877.86," Oh, God, my girlfriend found it in the drawer that they're night."
2877.86,2878.86, Right.
2878.86,2880.86," It was like, she's kind of like a flush light or something."
2880.86,2881.86, There you go.
2881.86,2883.86," It's like, we're just gonna go to the plug in the drawer."
2883.86,2886.86," Yeah, here she like, here's my headset."
2886.86,2891.86," It was like, she pulled it out like with two fingers."
2891.86,2892.86, You don't like it.
2892.86,2893.86, Seriously.
2893.86,2898.86, And this is basically a little like metal clip apparatus on it.
2898.86,2900.86," It's like, what is it?"
2900.86,2902.86, Because it's like how far is this gonna go?
2902.86,2904.86," You know, like, when are you getting to the like,"
2904.86,2906.86, this cyber to tell a dildoanics or whatever they call it?
2906.86,2908.86," You're like, when you come home and you're the internet,"
2908.86,2912.86," you're sitting there was like, such it comes on your dip holes and it's like,"
2912.86,2914.86, stuck between your legs.
2914.86,2916.86," Oh, if she really wanted to fit with something, I'll feel like she didn't."
2916.86,2919.86," She knew it was nothing like that, but I mean, she was,"
2919.86,2923.86," it was, it was definitely a look of disdain and contempt on her face as she pulled it out."
2923.86,2926.86," Because I had to like, you know, I played that thing in privacy."
2926.86,2927.86, I had me.
2927.86,2930.86," So you haven't worn the, you haven't worn that with her around."
2930.86,2931.86, I have it.
2931.86,2932.86," You don't really wear that with pride, you know."
2932.86,2933.86," It's just, what I'm like, what can I say?"
2933.86,2937.86," She was like, every time we go to a friends party and they got like karaoke revolution or something,"
2937.86,2940.86, they get all the girls get all drunk and sing on that bullshit.
2940.86,2941.86," Like, why would it be any more embarrassing?"
2941.86,2942.86, I don't be ashamed.
2942.86,2945.86, Having that been singing like the goddamn gin blossoms or something like that.
2945.86,2946.86," I'm like, karaoke revolution."
2946.86,2947.86, Where are probably Sean?
2947.86,2948.86, Put it on your head and get it over.
2948.86,2950.86," That's for you if you're listening Melissa, you heard that."
2950.86,2954.86, She'd like hear it from this.
2954.86,2955.86, Did you hear it anymore about Arma?
2956.86,2958.86," Now, that's it for me on that one."
2958.86,2960.86," But before we jump on over to many other things,"
2960.86,2964.86, I have been this weekend playing even more of a preview build of Overlord.
2964.86,2967.86, And I know I've talked about this briefly in the past.
2967.86,2969.86, And it's a game that no one is really talking about.
2969.86,2971.86, I keep looking online to see if it gets any more buzz out there.
2971.86,2973.86," But it really, it's like, pick men meets gremlins."
2973.86,2974.86, It's a lot.
2974.86,2976.86," If you've been hype it, you've been like in this game."
2976.86,2977.86, I have it.
2977.86,2979.86," It's like one of those things where like, if they follow through it,"
2979.86,2984.86," they have some cool multiplayer options coming up and you play in the review,"
2984.86,2985.86, although.
2985.86,2986.86," No, it's not. It's a previewable."
2986.86,2987.86, Okay.
2987.86,2989.86," So anyway, so I did like pick men."
2989.86,2993.86," Right. I mean, it's just like it's a little bit of puzzle solving."
2993.86,2995.86," It's pretty straightforward, but at the same point,"
2995.86,2997.86, it's open that enough that you have like these more
2997.86,2999.86, Allity choices inside the game.
2999.86,3002.86," So if you want to like just destroy the villagers and loot the town,"
3002.86,3003.86, you can do that.
3003.86,3005.86, And the game responds to what your action is.
3005.86,3008.86," So like the people will fear you and leave like,"
3008.86,3010.86," like sacrificial virgins up where you can play the nice,"
3010.86,3011.86, the relative nice guy.
3011.86,3015.86, And they'll just kind of like let you slaughter their sheep or whatever.
3015.86,3018.86," I mean, it's sacrificial virgins."
3018.86,3019.86, sacrificial lamps. There you go.
3019.86,3021.86, They'll give you the give you the.
3021.86,3025.86, Those damners and tweet up paper play to.
3025.86,3031.86, So I can't come on the time of twigs and she's.
3031.86,3033.86, Stams twigs and seeds.
3033.86,3036.86, Or would you like a big like spear of time?
3036.86,3040.86," Isn't like it the whole thing is based on your jaw, right?"
3040.86,3043.86, That's not for you.
3043.86,3046.86," No, but it's one of those things."
3046.86,3048.86," I just, you know, when I get more builds, I'm going to like totally"
3048.86,3051.86, pimped this to you guys so you can at least check it out because I think it's right.
3051.86,3052.86, It's worth it.
3052.86,3053.86, It's lame. We're going to call you on.
3053.86,3054.86, Call me on it.
3054.86,3056.86, But I'm having a fun time.
3056.86,3058.86, I turn sharky on to it. He's having a fun time with it.
3058.86,3059.86, Wow.
3059.86,3060.86, And that's one of those.
3060.86,3061.86, If Scott Sharky likes it.
3061.86,3062.86, He like any hates every.
3062.86,3064.86, He hates every thing.
3064.86,3066.86," I think the one thing I forget,"
3066.86,3068.86, we were joking at earlier in his testimony.
3068.86,3073.86," He's the game that Peter, if Peter Maloney you finished it game, that was fun and saw through to the end."
3073.86,3074.86, Ouch.
3074.86,3076.86, Yeah. That's pretty big. That's a pretty big praise.
3076.86,3079.86, Pretty big. A pretty big praise.
3079.86,3081.86," Ah, I can't even talk."
3081.86,3083.86," I'm going to say, I'll sweet talk about that."
3083.86,3084.86, True.
3087.86,3089.86," So, okay. Well, we're through."
3089.86,3090.86, We're through segment one.
3090.86,3091.86, That's a good plan.
3091.86,3092.86, Now we're at a good point.
3092.86,3094.86, We ran the goal at full one.
3094.86,3095.86, And there was still more.
3095.86,3096.86, Right.
3096.86,3097.86, That's good.
3097.86,3098.86, That's good.
3098.86,3100.86, That's good.
3100.86,3102.86, We're going to be talking about about downloadable content.
3102.86,3103.86, You're right.
3103.86,3104.86, To be continued to be continued.
3104.86,3106.86, We have six more segments to do.
3106.86,3107.86, Holy Jesus.
3107.86,3108.86, Obviously not going to be.
3108.86,3109.86, We'll do it.
3109.86,3110.86, At least one more.
3110.86,3111.86, We'll get back.
3111.86,3112.86, We're going to be.
3112.86,3113.86, From this break.
3113.86,3115.86, We'll be right back.
3115.86,3117.86," Three, two, one."
3117.86,3118.86, You're the best.
3118.86,3119.86, All right.
3119.86,3122.86, Listen to EGM live.
3122.86,3125.86, The weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly.
3125.86,3135.86, We'll see you back.
3135.86,3136.86, See you back already.
3136.86,3137.86, Did you miss us?
3137.86,3143.86, Do you want to do your little rant or show we just move on to the next.
3143.86,3145.86, That you want to.
3145.86,3146.86, We'll get all that.
3146.86,3148.86, We want to talk about held gate pricing.
3148.86,3149.86, We have got.
3149.86,3152.86, We had Bill Roper on the podcast last week for two hours.
3152.86,3153.86, And he was fantastic.
3154.86,3156.86, He's welcome back anytime.
3156.86,3157.86, We talked a lot about how gate.
3157.86,3159.86, But the one thing we didn't talk about was.
3159.86,3162.86, Was the one thing that a lot of people wanted to know about.
3162.86,3164.86, And we weren't avoiding the question.
3164.86,3165.86, We're going to talk about it right now.
3165.86,3167.86, The only reason we didn't actually was.
3167.86,3170.86, We were kind of in this weird place where.
3170.86,3172.86, The magazine wasn't quite out yet.
3172.86,3176.86, And the magazine is actually the place that broke all the way.
3176.86,3181.86, We knew about the pricing and it wasn't yet out on the interwebs.
3181.86,3182.86, So we didn't want to blow it.
3182.86,3184.86," Yeah, another cut our own issue."
3184.86,3185.86, Right.
3185.86,3187.86," But in the meantime, it actually got out."
3187.86,3189.86, Right around the time of our podcast.
3189.86,3190.86, So that's the problem.
3190.86,3192.86, So as soon as that issue hits like Zineo or whatever.
3192.86,3193.86, Right.
3193.86,3195.86, I think that we know we would have just called him on it because.
3195.86,3197.86, But but I got to say that.
3197.86,3198.86, I can call him on it.
3198.86,3199.86, It's just.
3199.86,3200.86, But I'm not even calling on him.
3200.86,3201.86, It's just because actually.
3201.86,3202.86," I mean, I'm in the camp."
3202.86,3204.86, I don't even know if there's much to call him on.
3204.86,3205.86, I don't.
3205.86,3206.86, I think that the sort of.
3206.86,3208.86, I'll throw about it was a little.
3209.86,3211.86," Well, it's a sneaker for election."
3211.86,3212.86, It's a little informed.
3212.86,3213.86," Yeah, it was a little knee chart."
3213.86,3215.86," Well, let's break it down then."
3215.86,3216.86, Okay.
3216.86,3220.86," To break it down, if you didn't see our article or read the million articles."
3220.86,3224.86, And you guys jump in with the details if I'm blowing it.
3224.86,3227.86, Is that the shipped.
3227.86,3230.86, Out of the box version of how get London when it comes out.
3230.86,3233.86, It's going to have complete free multiplayer.
3233.86,3235.86, You can play the whole game.
3235.86,3237.86, Multiplayer for free.
3237.86,3238.86, It's like Diablo 2.
3238.86,3241.86," So the guys who made Diablo 2, they made Diablo 1."
3241.86,3242.86, It's that same model.
3242.86,3243.86," Actually, not just Diablo 2."
3243.86,3244.86, Also Guild Wars.
3244.86,3247.86," I mean, basically, it's a very similar kind of like online model."
3247.86,3248.86, And that respect.
3248.86,3249.86, Right.
3249.86,3250.86, Exactly.
3250.86,3256.86," So, but what they announced in our magazine is that there is also going to be a monthly."
3256.86,3260.86, Page service called Elite or I don't know if they're going in there.
3260.86,3261.86, They're actually.
3261.86,3262.86," Yeah, apparently like."
3262.86,3266.86," I guess, maybe because of the reaction to the name."
3266.86,3268.86, It might be changing the name of the service.
3268.86,3269.86, Yeah.
3269.86,3270.86, The artist for me known as Leeds.
3270.86,3271.86," Well, this is a bad thing."
3271.86,3275.86, It's like Dana Dana wrote a wrap about this back in the 80s.
3275.86,3278.86," You know, and it was like, guys, don't even know that reference."
3278.86,3279.86, I lost.
3279.86,3280.86," No, I lost."
3280.86,3282.86, There's one listener who knows what I'm talking about.
3282.86,3283.86," Cinderella, Dana, Dana."
3283.86,3284.86, You got like the four widest guys.
3284.86,3287.86," It's like, it's basically like just."
3287.86,3290.86," You don't, you don't say you guys got the cool shit."
3290.86,3292.86, And you're guys going to be the pimps of the world.
3292.86,3293.86, And then.
3293.86,3296.86," And then the rest of your life, Cinderella, scrubbing the floors of your like,"
3296.86,3301.86," filthy stepsisters, you know, like that's what like Penny Arcade and a comic strip."
3301.86,3306.86, Reacted to everyone's just this ocean that you basically got the untouchables who like aren't paying.
3306.86,3309.86," And then you've got the elite, you know, right."
3309.86,3314.86, But the elite version is giving you access to things that you absolutely as far as I can see.
3314.86,3315.86, Don't need whatsoever.
3315.86,3318.86," You know, I mean, you're getting certain perks."
3318.86,3320.86, You're inventory or not.
3320.86,3321.86, You're inventory.
3321.86,3322.86, You're inventory or not.
3322.86,3323.86, You're inventory.
3323.86,3324.86, Your bank slots are bigger.
3324.86,3326.86, So you can hold more shit.
3326.86,3329.86, You can fast travel between locations.
3329.86,3330.86, That kind of thing.
3330.86,3331.86," Well, it's just stuff."
3331.86,3332.86," Well, there's fast travel."
3332.86,3333.86, That's not.
3333.86,3334.86," That's, that's, that's pretty big."
3334.86,3335.86, That's pretty big.
3335.86,3337.86, I was just thinking that's a convenience factor.
3337.86,3338.86, That's not a.
3338.86,3339.86," Yeah, but it's like, why should you have to pay for that?"
3339.86,3341.86, Because that's a pretty huge fucking convenience.
3341.86,3343.86, I got to take the heel to express for miles.
3343.86,3344.86, I might not.
3344.86,3345.86," You're in skierage, buddy."
3345.86,3350.86, When it's not going to cost them anymore to let me like fucking hit the menu screen and move from place to place.
3350.86,3353.86," That's, that is a straight rip off right there."
3353.86,3355.86, I don't want to come back on.
3355.86,3359.86," I want to be able to, I don't want to take the heel to express everywhere I go in your game."
3359.86,3362.86, Pay extra money to get on the people mover.
3362.86,3364.86, Stupid dude.
3364.86,3365.86, Maybe that one is.
3365.86,3369.86," I mean, I don't, you know, it's like, it's maybe there's some of the elements that I can understand,"
3369.86,3371.86," like, you know, taking issue with."
3371.86,3376.86," But overall, I mean, like, it's, if you play the upload too and you, and you got no complaints about playing that for free,"
3376.86,3379.86, then you're getting that plus you're getting a little more while I'm over.
3379.86,3383.86," You're friends, say we're going in like Darren, we got to get to the castle in our"
3383.86,3389.86," school and then I'm like, see a, and then you're like walking, walking and I'm like, you get a message for me."
3389.86,3390.86, Hurry up on that.
3390.86,3391.86, I'll go.
3391.86,3395.86," And you're like, oh, I just got ambushed by a mob, I'll be there in an hour or so."
3395.86,3397.86," And like, a fuck it never mind."
3397.86,3398.86," Dude, I'm already level 28."
3398.86,3400.86," I'll just let you, let you do what you do."
3400.86,3402.86, You can go play with some of your other low rent pleams.
3402.86,3405.86, That's Darren in that case.
3405.86,3406.86," Oh, no."
3406.86,3407.86, I pointed.
3408.86,3411.86," And that is not the, I played myself as the lead."
3411.86,3412.86, I was paying.
3412.86,3419.86," No, but I guess, I guess what I'm saying is, I mean, it really is like, I could totally, I mean, I'm kind of on the fence on this myself because if you think about it, like,"
3419.86,3427.86," you're on, on one, on one hand, you're comparing this to Guild Wars, but on the other hand, it's probably it's also adding a lot more than you would pay for for world of warcraft."
3427.86,3428.86, Right.
3428.86,3432.86," And so I mean, like, then you could take, you know, you could take the flip side and say, hey, it's cheaper than world of warcraft."
3432.86,3433.86, It gives you a lot more.
3433.86,3436.86, They're promising like regular content updates once or twice a month.
3436.86,3440.86," That, that's actually the biggest part of the main thing is the extra content."
3440.86,3442.86, The cosmetic stuff is fine.
3442.86,3443.86," You know, I don't care."
3443.86,3448.86," You got to like a pink sash on your neck or something. That's fine. I mean, you don't cover my pink sash."
3448.86,3451.86," And I mean, and those are like, yeah, I mean,"
3451.86,3458.86," I talk about like extra like missions, like areas, monsters, weapons, classes, possibly."
3458.86,3463.86," I mean, that's the kind of stuff that's, that's talking about like for rolling out an eventual content."
3463.86,3468.86," And I think that you compare that with a, a, wow, as opposed to a guild wars."
3468.86,3471.86," And you're like, you know, that makes sense for 10 bucks a month."
3471.86,3474.86," Yeah, I mean, this all totally dependent on how much they can pop out."
3474.86,3475.86, That's exactly it.
3475.86,3477.86," And they don't even know. They say like, we're right."
3477.86,3479.86, One a month and maybe another small year.
3479.86,3481.86, It could end up being like half a pound.
3481.86,3482.86, That's a sound too.
3482.86,3483.86," No, no, that's exactly it."
3483.86,3487.86," It's like one of those things where I'm like, it sounds like a great, it sounds like a great idea right now."
3487.86,3490.86," But you know, ask me again in three months when it's actually that's pretty much what you're paying for."
3490.86,3495.86," The reason they give you the other stuff on top of it. I can imagine them all saying, okay, that's enough right there."
3495.86,3501.86," The, the whole reason you would even charge for this is to have a team working on additional content at a regular pace, right?"
3501.86,3508.86," And now, if they say, okay, whatever we don't hit our deadlines or something, then you have to have a reason why you're paying as a script and fee."
3508.86,3511.86, And that's when I think that's maybe where this other stuff came in.
3511.86,3515.86," Okay, because like, so as possible, I misrepresented it by presenting it in that order."
3515.86,3519.86," I mean, really the main reason you're paying the monthly fee is for more."
3519.86,3538.86," That's at least my guess. Well, it's a combination of things. It's the extra content plus the the white love service plus, you know, you, you, you, as, as a, as an elite member or whatever they're calling it, you can, but you're basically this digital free mason. You can like build, build, build, you know, create a guilt right, but, but hopefully the game is going to be good enough out of the box that you would never have to do this and not notice."
3538.86,3548.86," But that's the, I'll look to never know that additional content and people are still playing the only time you will notice is when you're in that in these main hub areas where you, where the different characters will interact or you can create a filter and say, I don't want to do this."
3548.86,3570.86," I don't want to see these people. Okay, because the noticing thing. Yeah, I think that's part of it because like once upon a time I was very sort of like indifferent to the downloadable content or pro downloadable content because it's like, hey, when I buy a game, it says on the box, when I'm getting and I know what I'm going to get what I'm paying for it. It's like if a month later, they're like, oh, well, now we've got new vehicles and new guns and stuff."
3570.86,3575.86," I can't demand it because I made the, I entered the agreement knowing that those things weren't there, right?"
3575.86,3586.86," Yeah. However, I played, you know, I'll turn this, this will be cracked down, but definitely in the context of hellgating to go back, but like, I got the downloadable, the free downloadable patch for crackdown on the weekend."
3586.86,3599.86," And what it does is basically turns the game into a fucked up nightmare. It gives you some good stuff. But at the same time, no, it turns it into like, okay, here's an example. You're jumping around. It gives you a ability, you know, you can turn on like, you know,"
3599.86,3608.86, super level 5 agility or whatever. So you're jumping around. What do you see? There's this flashing light on a building. Let's jump up there. I can jump jump really high now. Let's get up there.
3608.86,3615.86," Hit that flashing light. You must download content to access this mission. Would you like to download content like, sorry."
3615.86,3621.86," Oh, then then you're like, you open up a menu, spawn this this or that. You know, do you want to spawn this new gun? Sorry."
3621.86,3634.86," And then the menu comes up again. Click here to download the content. Do you want this new do but you know, click here to download content. And as you're playing everywhere in the world, you're seeing these constant reminders. And it definitely is like homer shifts and going in fucking itching scratch land."
3634.86,3641.86," And they're like, oh, sorry, you can't ride. You can't ride Nargo Mountain. We only take itching scratch your bucks for that."
3641.86,3651.86," But it's like, okay, maybe I know, maybe even if the sign out the front of the door said, you know, a pass to this theme park is only going to get you access to some rides."
3651.86,3658.86," But then when you walk in and like every other moment you see a giant sign saying, sorry, but your ghetto passes and then up to cut it."
3658.86,3664.86, Like then it gets dumb. It's like this what you turn the game that I bought into a just an advertisement to buy some more shit.
3664.86,3681.86," And it's like, I can't turn that off. And my fear is also for games for Windows live is that because you know, Mark Rayn, when I spoke to him said, of course, that they, the Microsoft wants the developer to every every bit of functionality that's available to a goal to your subscriber has to be visible to a silver."
3681.86,3690.86," So, you know, okay, subscribe, but a non-paying subscriber. And that way, they're constantly being reminded of how much greener the grass is on the other side."
3690.86,3694.86," Now, I'm wondering if that goes because, you know, crackdown's clear of Microsoft first party game."
3694.86,3699.86," If it goes to the downloadable content too, where not only do you have to do you offer it and you have to charge for it."
3699.86,3705.86, But you have to make it like ubiquitous like the sales pitch to anyone. So it's like almost regretting getting the patch.
3705.86,3710.86," And like, cool, I could run faster now, but who cares? Like my whole world is just an advertisement to buy the buy some money."
3710.86,3716.86, And you can't uninstall it. And you can't uninstall patches and stuff on 360 games.
3716.86,3723.86," So, you have currently if I'm wrong, but like, oh, I'm sure maybe you're going to like the the save game area you could play to lead some of that delete those."
3723.86,3728.86, I don't know. That kind of suck it. And I really hope to get rid of the silver and gold tears.
3729.86,3730.86, Such a fuck.
3730.86,3731.86, You have to be alive.
3731.86,3734.86, So that's the thing. Like how gay cannot do that. That'll be so dumb.
3734.86,3739.86," Or like, if everywhere you look, there's like the Jones is that you can't keep up with."
3739.86,3743.86," Yeah, and that's not a favor of games adding this like first class and coach."
3743.86,3744.86, That's right.
3744.86,3747.86, That's the analogy I used for the the hell gay story when I wrote it was just that it really does.
3747.86,3752.86," It's like it really is that like, you know, I'm getting I'm still getting to the same destination."
3752.86,3755.86," But I'm stuck between two fatties and like,"
3755.86,3760.86," I mean, what I have the pregnant woman and yeah, like some dude who's arm fat stripper."
3760.86,3762.86, There was all this life chair.
3762.86,3769.86," My, my, I mean, what I'm with like a hog order drink after drinking and they're making them sweat more and pretty soon."
3769.86,3772.86, This dude smells like fucking like a puke like a puke burp.
3772.86,3775.86, Can I get that extra sorry after three.
3775.86,3781.86," I was on a south west flight. I barely, I almost mystifies one of those things where they were like,"
3781.86,3786.86," sorry, you're going to have to run sir, so like I run and I get on, I get on the plane."
3786.86,3789.86, There is one seat left. It's totally false.
3789.86,3796.86, A middle seat and on one side is one of the super fat women who who probably should have had to buy two seats.
3796.86,3797.86, Right.
3797.86,3798.86, And on the other side.
3798.86,3799.86, And purple.
3799.86,3802.86, Why would that have been your mom?
3802.86,3806.86," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
3806.86,3808.86, We could play. We could play mama jokes.
3809.86,3810.86, I like mama jokes.
3810.86,3815.86," And on the other side, the other side was a woman with a newborn baby."
3815.86,3822.86," And as I walked up to the seat, the, the heavy set woman goes, yep, you got the booby pricey."
3822.86,3824.86, I was so funny.
3824.86,3826.86," Yeah, yeah, I made a trip."
3826.86,3827.86," Yeah, I did make the trip."
3827.86,3830.86," And then you like them think like that though, so I know what you're saying."
3830.86,3834.86," Actually, I ended up holding the woman's baby so that she could take a nap."
3834.86,3835.86," Oh, I'm nice that way."
3835.86,3836.86, Yeah.
3837.86,3838.86," Anyway, interesting guy."
3838.86,3839.86," Just told that story, just it."
3839.86,3840.86," Oh, Captain."
3840.86,3841.86, I'm great.
3841.86,3842.86, I just want to talk about that.
3842.86,3843.86, See you right now.
3843.86,3844.86, Okay.
3844.86,3846.86," So, uh, no, purple."
3846.86,3847.86, That's the thing.
3847.86,3848.86, I want the world to start.
3848.86,3849.86, I was my dream.
3849.86,3851.86," You know, back when Mollets galore came out the website."
3851.86,3852.86, Yeah.
3852.86,3855.86," Yeah. And it was like for a while, like, a lot, even though everyone had Mollets,"
3855.86,3857.86," there was like people who were just like, oh, he should."
3857.86,3858.86, This is funny.
3858.86,3860.86," Because if you look, people do have this haircut."
3860.86,3862.86," You know, like that was like whatever, like,"
3862.86,3863.86," like, 1999 or something."
3863.86,3867.86," And then like, it got to a point where there's like movies that basically had, like,"
3867.86,3869.86, spoof characters with Mollets and I shit like that.
3869.86,3871.86, But it like purple pride.
3871.86,3875.86," I wanted to make like a purple, uh, an eggplant hunting website where you basically, like,"
3875.86,3878.86, morbidly obese people wear purple and pink.
3878.86,3882.86, And you basically get the pictures of the eggplants or grimaces or whatever.
3882.86,3884.86, I was about to get a picture of people inspired by grimaces.
3884.86,3886.86," Yeah, we had various, like, like, parties."
3886.86,3889.86," You know, we had all these different categories."
3889.86,3891.86," But, uh, no, when I worked at a grocery store,"
3891.86,3892.86, that's one way I'd keep saying.
3892.86,3893.86, We had the eggplant watch.
3893.86,3896.86," And we had, it was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
3896.86,3897.86," Which kind of like, no, watch it come."
3897.86,3898.86, This is $1.
3898.86,3900.86, This is for all the brand of tacos in your daily.
3900.86,3901.86," Start this game, dude, in your life."
3901.86,3902.86, It's so much better.
3902.86,3903.86, Okay.
3903.86,3907.86," Um, if they had a paint, a purple top or purple bottoms alone,"
3907.86,3908.86, it would be like worth 1.
3908.86,3911.86," You know, uh, it would be, if it was a combo of pink and purple,"
3911.86,3913.86, then you would get another point.
3913.86,3915.86," Because pink is like the other, you know, secondary color."
3915.86,3917.86," But then if you had head to toe purple, it would be three."
3917.86,3919.86," And then the mother was like, if they checked out the power card,"
3919.86,3920.86," you know, the little like,"
3920.86,3922.86," the little like,"
3922.86,3924.86," the little like,"
3924.86,3926.86," the askle and they were in purple and in that bad boy,"
3926.86,3928.86," then like, you would just win for the day straight up."
3928.86,3929.86, I don't know.
3929.86,3930.86, Go home then.
3930.86,3933.86, It's because they were so fat.
3933.86,3934.86, They kind of walk.
3934.86,3935.86," Well, because they don't want to."
3935.86,3936.86," I mean, because it's not their own."
3936.86,3937.86," We had, okay."
3937.86,3939.86, We had a courtesy was a nice.
3939.86,3941.86, This is an nice conversation.
3941.86,3943.86," Well, I mean, it's hilarious conversation."
3943.86,3944.86, Okay.
3944.86,3947.86," But yeah, we have them that we had the cards in the front of the store."
3947.86,3949.86," And if you chose to get in that thing,"
3949.86,3960.86," you're going to be like,"
3960.86,3961.86," you're going to be like, too."
3961.86,3962.86, That guy was right.
3962.86,3963.86, Wow.
3963.86,3964.86, Okay.
3964.86,3965.86, I don't know why you talked about this on the game.
3965.86,3966.86, Do you think that purple?
3966.86,3968.86, They think purple makes them look thinner.
3968.86,3969.86, It's slimming.
3969.86,3970.86, I don't know.
3970.86,3972.86, I only look 48 in this.
3972.86,3975.86, Okay.
3975.86,3977.86, I'm wearing my mumu.
3977.86,3980.86," I was in saying, I wasn't being mean."
3980.86,3983.86, I was being self-reflective there.
3983.86,3984.86, Yeah.
3984.86,3985.86, Yeah.
3985.86,3986.86, All right.
3986.86,3987.86, Yeah.
3987.86,3988.86, That's a disclaimer.
3988.86,3989.86, There's a role.
3989.86,3992.86, GFW does not think that being obese is funny.
3992.86,3993.86, No.
3993.86,3995.86, If you happen to be in your listening.
3995.86,3997.86, Just don't wear purple.
3997.86,3998.86, We're not laughing at you.
3998.86,3999.86, Yeah.
3999.86,4001.86, Just don't send us pictures of yourself in certain combinations.
4001.86,4002.86, No.
4002.86,4003.86, That's funny.
4003.86,4005.86," Plus, we have a few of us here."
4005.86,4006.86, We can probably also lose a few.
4006.86,4009.86," Now that we're offending people, should we just launch into the hero of the web?"
4009.86,4011.86," Guys, I'm not myself."
4011.86,4012.86, Yeah.
4012.86,4015.86, Let's go into the web to deflect the black door.
4015.86,4016.86, Okay.
4016.86,4019.86, I might change voices midway in this because I was going to try to read this in some other
4019.86,4021.86," thing and if I can't do it, I suspect I can't."
4021.86,4023.86, Whiskey nerds out this week.
4023.86,4024.86, Yeah.
4024.86,4025.86, He's out.
4025.86,4026.86, Whiskey.
4026.86,4027.86," Plus, Whiskey doesn't like."
4027.86,4028.86, He became his own dude.
4028.86,4030.86, He doesn't read other people's.
4030.86,4031.86, He just ran to him.
4031.86,4032.86, He's trying to tell other people.
4032.86,4034.86, I'm not someone else's or.
4035.86,4036.86, Okay.
4036.86,4042.86, So I have to give thanks to one up.com user killer slinky who sent me this and the p.m. box.
4042.86,4046.86, And he found this on the four craft dedicated for him.
4046.86,4051.86, And you were just accusing Lord of the Rings players as being a special breed.
4051.86,4054.86, And other MMO players being immune to that.
4054.86,4055.86, So.
4055.86,4056.86, Okay.
4056.86,4057.86, I don't know about immune.
4057.86,4061.86, Who pulled Jindah from World of Warcraft has this to say?
4062.86,4065.86," Truth, carry out seaving hatred for all races."
4065.86,4070.86, The darks be a tolerate members of the hoard out of blood data honor for saving them from rampaging
4070.86,4071.86, Murlocs.
4071.86,4075.86, They've been fighting humans and else since humans and else have been around.
4075.86,4078.86, They generally bigots and feel superior to all other races.
4078.86,4082.86, They believe that only the strongest should survive in breed.
4082.86,4086.86, They believe that so much that they'll let their own young die in the wild that the very young age
4086.86,4088.86, if they're not strong enough.
4089.86,4092.86," I'm sorry, but there's no way that trolls believe in mixing with other races."
4092.86,4095.86," If they capture an L for a human, they're going to kill each other."
4095.86,4100.860000000001," You aside from that, it's pretty doubtful that humans could ever survive sex with trolls for the"
4100.860000000001,4103.860000000001, of your fear for a fuck it for a few reasons.
4103.860000000001,4107.860000000001," First of all, trolls are a lot bigger than humans."
4107.860000000001,4109.860000000001, Trolls are very primal and savage in nature.
4109.860000000001,4112.860000000001, There is no gentle hold me and whisper in my ear.
4112.860000000001,4114.860000000001," Baby sex for trolls, I'd wager."
4114.860000000001,4116.860000000001, You've seen discovery channel.
4116.86,4119.86," Yeah, it's probably like that with biting itself mutilation."
4119.86,4120.86, It tosses everywhere.
4120.86,4122.86, Human loins cannot withstand the troll.
4122.86,4124.86, End of story.
4124.86,4125.86," Sorry, Pants."
4125.86,4126.86, You could never pleasure a troll either.
4126.86,4128.86, She break you in half and be very displeased.
4128.86,4131.86, Nothing she'd ever find a human attractive.
4131.86,4133.86, Trolls and elves admittedly are more compatible.
4133.86,4135.86, At least night elves anyway.
4135.86,4138.86, Too bad they hate each other more than humans and trolls.
4138.86,4142.86," They're two different culturally, socially, spiritually and physically from the Alliance"
4142.86,4144.86, races for this to ever happen in my opinion.
4144.86,4148.86, Some dogs be going to be more tolerant than normal due to fighting in the third world
4148.86,4149.86, alongside all enemies.
4149.86,4152.86, With that's not going to make enough of them.
4152.86,4155.86, All gold shy as cybers with each other.
4155.86,4156.86, Wow.
4156.86,4158.86, I got all shy or cybers.
4158.86,4159.86, It was like one word.
4159.86,4160.86, Sorry.
4160.86,4161.86, Wow.
4161.86,4162.86, I got to ask.
4162.86,4164.86," When you were listening to this, did any of you"
4164.86,4165.86, envisioning like Steve Irwin?
4165.86,4166.86, Like it's just...
4166.86,4169.86, I was actually just picturing some guy typing that in his wife
4169.86,4170.86, and the other I'm going.
4170.86,4171.86, Honey.
4171.86,4173.86, What are you doing in there?
4173.86,4174.86, I'm coming up my feet.
4174.86,4175.86, Yeah.
4175.86,4177.86, I got a new purple dress.
4177.86,4180.86, I'm a new purple 90.
4180.86,4182.86, Purple Moomoo.
4182.86,4183.86," Oh, that's..."
4183.86,4188.86, Do you like coulda said circus tape or like...
4188.86,4189.86," No, no, no."
4189.86,4190.86, I'm commenting on that.
4190.86,4191.86, That doesn't spiritual.
4191.86,4192.86," Yeah, that's all sad."
4192.86,4193.86, Yeah.
4193.86,4194.86, It's all true though.
4194.86,4196.86, But so that I like that.
4196.86,4198.86, It was a good find for killer because...
4198.86,4199.86, That was good.
4199.86,4200.86, Yeah.
4200.86,4201.86, It was a killer.
4201.86,4202.86, It was a killer.
4202.86,4203.86, It was a killer.
4203.86,4204.86, It was a killer.
4204.86,4205.86, It was a killer.
4205.86,4207.86, It was a killer.
4207.86,4208.86, It was a killer.
4208.86,4209.86, It was a killer.
4209.86,4210.86, It was a killer.
4210.86,4211.86, It was a killer.
4211.86,4212.86, It was a killer.
4212.86,4213.86, It was a killer.
4213.86,4214.86, It was a killer.
4214.86,4215.86, It was a killer.
4215.86,4216.86, It was a killer.
4216.86,4217.86, It was a killer.
4217.86,4218.86, It was a killer.
4218.86,4219.86, It was a killer.
4219.86,4220.86, It was a killer.
4220.86,4221.86, It was a killer.
4221.86,4222.86, It was a killer.
4222.86,4223.86, It was a killer.
4223.86,4224.86, It was a killer.
4224.86,4225.86, It was a killer.
4225.86,4226.86, It was a killer.
4226.86,4227.86, It was a killer.
4227.86,4228.86, It was a killer.
4229.86,4230.86, Why is it?
4230.86,4231.86, I know.
4231.86,4232.86, It's some straight-up raises in there.
4232.86,4233.86, Back in the bus.
4233.86,4234.86, Yeah.
4234.86,4235.86, Yeah.
4235.86,4238.86," That's basically, I think that argument probably exists in Star Trek land."
4238.86,4239.86, It's just clingons.
4239.86,4240.86, It exists in other ones too.
4240.86,4241.86, Yeah.
4241.86,4244.86, Maybe Star Wars or someone that like had that debate about if you could like tap
4244.86,4245.86, Chubaca and live.
4245.86,4246.86, Uh-huh.
4246.86,4247.86, You know.
4247.86,4249.86, I'm nothing proof.
4249.86,4250.86, I'm nothing proof.
4250.86,4253.86, I'm nothing proof.
4253.86,4254.86, What about job?
4254.86,4255.86, What about job?
4255.86,4256.86, I do.
4256.86,4257.86, What about job?
4257.86,4258.86, No.
4258.86,4263.86," Well, if anybody has any opinions out there on having sex with me on the TV series,"
4263.86,4265.86," yeah, interspaceship, mingling."
4265.86,4266.86, Let us now.
4266.86,4267.86, Please.
4267.86,4268.86, But serious response is only.
4268.86,4272.86, You don't permit that.
4272.86,4276.86," No, but it's not only that we don't permit that shit because it's not realistic."
4276.86,4278.86, But you're in a role playing clan.
4278.86,4280.86, You're in a game called World of Workcraft.
4280.86,4281.86, But you talk about realism.
4281.86,4282.86, What?
4282.86,4283.86, No.
4283.86,4284.86, No.
4284.86,4285.86, No.
4286.86,4287.86, All right.
4287.86,4288.86, Wow.
4288.86,4289.86, Okay.
4289.86,4290.86, Where are we at here?
4290.86,4293.86, I'm going for like an hour and ten.
4293.86,4295.86, There's got some pre-e3.
4295.86,4296.86," Oh, yeah."
4296.86,4297.86, Okay.
4297.86,4305.86," I guess by the time we are back, if we're allowed to come back to do this again, we will have."
4305.86,4308.86, We will know what Blizzard's next game is.
4308.86,4311.86, You could guys all did anyone hear good about Blizzard's website?
4311.86,4312.86, They have a little teaser up.
4312.86,4313.86," Oh, yeah."
4313.86,4314.86, Is there a line thing?
4314.86,4315.86, That's just a timeline.
4315.86,4316.86," I mean, the question mark is a question."
4316.86,4317.86, Right.
4317.86,4318.86, It's not really a teaser.
4318.86,4319.86, It's not shit.
4319.86,4320.86, Like a trigger or something.
4320.86,4323.86, I think I'm definitely back fully back in Rob.
4323.86,4324.86," Uh, Villarupers camp."
4324.86,4325.86, I think it's Starcraft 2.
4325.86,4326.86, Yeah.
4326.86,4328.86, I think the MMO stuff was totally off his occasion.
4328.86,4329.86, No doubt about it.
4329.86,4330.86, Yep.
4330.86,4331.86, You think.
4331.86,4332.86, Yeah.
4332.86,4335.86," I mean, he had several arguments, but the one about like an outstanding career."
4335.86,4336.86," I mean, it's like, come on."
4336.86,4337.86, Yeah.
4337.86,4338.86, Yeah.
4338.86,4339.86, You know what?
4339.86,4340.86, I think it's a me Starcraft 2 as well.
4340.86,4343.86, But the one thing I'm going to throw out there is I think they're going to go beyond just the usual.
4343.86,4344.86, I think he's a RTS.
4344.86,4348.86," I think they're like, like, every once in a while, they just can they just throw things out."
4348.86,4349.86, There was some crazy news shit.
4349.86,4352.86," I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised that maybe they had an R, an MMO, I'm sorry."
4352.86,4356.86," In RTS, with maybe some MMO elements to it."
4356.86,4359.86, I'm pretty sure those are going to be something persistent.
4359.86,4361.86, A persistent or a conquest map.
4361.86,4362.86, Yeah.
4362.86,4363.86, They want that subscription fee.
4363.86,4364.86, Yeah.
4364.86,4368.86, So is that everybody is that people's guests that there will be a monthly event.
4368.86,4370.86, But it's not going to be World of Warcraft with like aliens.
4370.86,4371.86, Yeah.
4371.86,4372.86, Yeah.
4372.86,4373.86, Yeah.
4373.86,4374.86, Yeah.
4374.86,4376.86, There was a brief moment where that rumor came up.
4376.86,4377.86," Was like, oh, is it going to be that?"
4377.86,4380.86," Well, I think it's kind of like an ongoing joke for me, but I didn't think that, you know,"
4380.86,4381.86, I don't think it's too soon.
4381.86,4387.86, It's just the sheer like number of people that would be required to do a World of Starcraft as well as a World of Warcraft.
4387.86,4389.86, It just makes no sense.
4389.86,4390.86, Right.
4390.86,4394.86," I think it makes more sense if they're setting up a World of Starcraft, whatever that might be."
4394.86,4399.86," By first, you know, getting Starcraft back out there after 10 years and then doing an expansion and saying,"
4400.86,4403.86," Okay, here is the universal going into in World of Starcraft."
4403.86,4404.86, Right.
4404.86,4405.86, And 12.
4405.86,4409.86, Maybe awesome if they just threw everybody for a loop and this announced something completely random.
4409.86,4411.86, It's a Dune bug-uasing game.
4411.86,4414.86," Oh, it's marathon."
4414.86,4415.86, No.
4415.86,4417.86, It's Warcraft Rally.
4417.86,4419.86, People on Blackthand.
4419.86,4421.86, People would go insane for that.
4421.86,4424.86, Remember when Rockstar did Rockstar table tennis?
4424.86,4425.86, People didn't care.
4425.86,4426.86, The Rockstar game.
4426.86,4428.86," They were talking about, I don't know."
4428.86,4429.86, I don't care about that.
4429.86,4432.86, It was people on the press that seemed to care a lot.
4432.86,4433.86, That's what I mean.
4433.86,4434.86, Yeah.
4434.86,4436.86," Well, that's because they wanted the GTA 4 exclusive gravy."
4436.86,4437.86," Oh, yeah."
4437.86,4438.86, You got a table tennis game?
4438.86,4439.86, Bring it on over.
4439.86,4440.86, Bring it on over.
4440.86,4441.86, I love it.
4441.86,4442.86," Oh, by the way."
4442.86,4445.86," Wait, what it comes time to talk about a GTA 4."
4445.86,4446.86," No, don't forget."
4446.86,4448.86, Don't forget to come by.
4448.86,4451.86, If we give you that the table tennis exclusive now.
4451.86,4453.86, Did there was some like that.
4453.86,4455.86," I hear that that was a legitimately fun game, you know?"
4456.86,4458.86, But remember when I said it around those preview links?
4458.86,4466.86," And it was like this is probably, no, it was like this is the best video representation of a sport never made."
4466.86,4468.86," I mean, it was saying that shit."
4468.86,4469.86, It was previews.
4469.86,4470.86, It was in previews.
4470.86,4471.86, It was pong.
4471.86,4472.86, Yeah.
4472.86,4473.86, It was pong.
4473.86,4474.86, It was a pretty sleep with hookers.
4474.86,4476.86, So like before you played.
4476.86,4477.86," No, no, no."
4477.86,4478.86," Dude, don't even go."
4478.86,4479.86, That shit is so played out Jeff.
4479.86,4481.86, I expect better for you.
4481.86,4482.86, It's a Rockstar game.
4482.86,4484.86," Like, here's a good idea for a headline."
4484.86,4485.86, So it's sucking you off.
4485.86,4487.86, You played table tennis under the table.
4487.86,4489.86, I know what the joke is that it is played out.
4489.86,4490.86, You do cocaine lines off the table.
4490.86,4492.86," That was a meta joke, dude."
4492.86,4493.86, That was very bad.
4493.86,4494.86, Now I'm happy then.
4494.86,4495.86, I owe you for that.
4495.86,4496.86, Monchoke man.
4496.86,4497.86, I still hurt.
4497.86,4499.86, I wound it.
4499.86,4501.86, I'm in for one of his mom.
4501.86,4506.86," I mean, I remember what started that."
4506.86,4507.86, Starcraft.
4507.86,4508.86, I'll start.
4508.86,4510.86, That's how we got him.
4510.86,4512.86," Yeah, I see that connection leap."
4512.86,4513.86, Yeah.
4513.86,4515.86, There's probably nothing left to say about that.
4515.86,4516.86," No, we'll just find out."
4516.86,4517.86, Everyone's weak.
4517.86,4518.86, Everyone's weak.
4518.86,4519.86, Everyone's weak.
4519.86,4520.86, Place your best.
4520.86,4522.86, Expert on what Blizzard is doing according to the internet.
4522.86,4523.86, Because everyone has their opinions.
4523.86,4524.86," Oh, no."
4524.86,4525.86, That doesn't make any sense.
4525.86,4526.86, So it must be this.
4526.86,4529.86," If you go back and look at all the stuff before they announce World of Warcraft,"
4529.86,4531.86, everybody was wrong on that.
4531.86,4533.86, That's the one that came out of the blue.
4533.86,4535.86, Nobody saw it coming.
4535.86,4536.86, No.
4536.86,4538.86," Except for us, because we had to, yeah, exclusive."
4538.86,4540.86," We had to North American, exclusive."
4540.86,4541.86, We were the first ones to see it.
4541.86,4542.86, No one saw before us.
4542.86,4543.86, I was the first person to play it.
4543.86,4544.86, No.
4544.86,4545.86, Yeah.
4545.86,4546.86, The first one.
4546.86,4549.86," But before we went straight to the story, yeah, I broke the story."
4549.86,4550.86," No one saw it, but me first."
4550.86,4551.86, I saw it first.
4551.86,4554.86, You would not believe where I am today.
4554.86,4557.86," I, I bet the offices of the outside."
4557.86,4559.86, It doesn't look like a gaming office.
4559.86,4560.86, Inside.
4560.86,4563.86," It's a wonderful, a hard at work."
4563.86,4566.86," On the son of a swimming business park in Irvine, California."
4566.86,4567.86, Wow.
4567.86,4568.86, You done?
4568.86,4569.86, I'm done.
4569.86,4570.86," You didn't even get to the,"
4570.86,4573.86, the snack machine in the lobby.
4573.86,4575.86, Did orange juice and cheese.
4575.86,4578.86, And it's free associating every lame story.
4578.86,4579.86, And it's written.
4579.86,4580.86, And written.
4580.86,4582.86, Not point in fingers there.
4582.86,4583.86, Yeah.
4583.86,4584.86, Okay.
4584.86,4585.86, Let's see.
4585.86,4588.86, The last item on the list says goodbye fuckers.
4588.86,4589.86, No.
4589.86,4590.86, We're not there.
4590.86,4591.86, We're not there.
4591.86,4592.86," We'll dip, they're ended."
4592.86,4593.86," And you did, too."
4593.86,4594.86, The say good thing.
4594.86,4595.86, Did you guys want to talk about that?
4595.86,4596.86, Before we get to goodbye fuckers.
4596.86,4598.86, It's kind of looking forward to goodbye fuckers.
4598.86,4599.86, Yeah.
4599.86,4600.86," We, uh, yeah."
4600.86,4601.86, Yeah.
4601.86,4602.86, We're back fuckers.
4602.86,4608.86," Last week began the first of the many, many weeks of pre-e3 activities."
4608.86,4614.86, Which I got to say is a stupidest thing ever invented in the history of the universe.
4614.86,4617.86," There's like two months of, and I'm not exaggerating."
4617.86,4622.86," There's, there's, uh, we're now, we used to have E3 in the old days."
4622.86,4625.86," Ladies and gentlemen, where we would go down and we would."
4625.86,4626.86, We would.
4626.86,4656.86, We would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we would go down and we

4669.46,4674.66," Aye whacks, I will go down, and maintain a categories, I just think in the full day one, John Masher that coach is an angry man stronger than that cook wood."
4674.96,4680.16," Killed beef, and it kept on the back I didn't end up the os the website is the pie up hill again."
4681.179999999999,4685.799999999999," As we tried this, I started gasketking machine start to go down to theadura with"
4685.8,4689.860000000001, Ubisoft and EA right and
4689.860000000001,4692.12, And Microsoft throw showed bro
4692.56,4695.06, Microsoft showed he's I can't talk
4695.76,4699.24, Microsoft showed Halo 3 on Friday so we can't talk about Ube
4699.24,4705.14, I don't know when that embargo does lift we're all in your NDA right now. I want to talk about
4705.14,4707.28, There's norms like that. I don't even say it
4707.6,4709.6, She could say
4709.6,4711.6, Even announced it
4714.08,4716.08, When did you become a PR person?
4717.08,4722.400000000001, Don't talk about brothers with you guys can't talk about the Sega stuff. We so we went to Sega last week
4723.400000000001,4725.400000000001, So that was a lineup of Sega games
4726.88,4728.88, And then
4728.88,4730.88, Bye
4735.88,4737.88," Yeah, we're 50-five Jesus boy"
4739.6,4741.6, Oh
4743.68,4746.320000000001, Whoa easy they're on the mic broken
4747.8,4749.8, So that that was a mix
4750.4400000000005,4752.4400000000005, bag of a lineup in terms of
4753.08,4754.08, PC
4754.08,4757.96, Well first of all we weren't seeing their whole lineup on like in the start-up at bagging on them
4757.96,4761.900000000001, But we they did show one thing that was bad don't say that either man what?
4762.54,4765.14, Big did a mixed bag of meaty gameplay
4766.1,4769.42, I'm kidding makes fun of me goodness you can't make fun of me goodness
4770.22,4774.42, You can't make fun of on the first one to ever see it and then start talking about makes bags of meaty game
4775.740000000001,4780.700000000001," Okay, the point is we saw one game that was leading on the PC that looked quite good"
4781.42,4783.42, Universe at war universe at war
4783.42,4789.34, There anyone at you want to take that ball? I will take that ball run with it. I thought it was a I mean we've we've cut
4789.34,4792.820000000001, We've covered we've previewed it in the past in the magazine and it's
4793.74,4798.96, Near near future Earth and Bay Earth gets invaded. I know how much really people know about the game
4798.96,4805.219999999999, I mean how much do you know about the game before I knew very little even though Ryan had written a story about it and I edited it
4806.219999999999,4809.0199999999995, I forgot mad by the time I saw actually saw the game
4809.0199999999995,4812.9," So I mean should do a story on that the wheel. Yeah. Oh, we did"
4813.9,4816.86, Captain of our ship you should draw your right into the right into the iceberg
4817.46,4819.46, Why ever we covered this god dammit
4819.46,4822.3," No, so it's gotten here"
4822.3,4829.38, So this is this is the next game for you guys a petroglyph who did an Empire war last year right to find Star Wars RTS
4829.38,4834.12," Yes, so the two things that kind of stood at to me as something that I thought were pretty cool about this game"
4834.12,4837.3, It kind of took the hard point so that we're on this in
4837.86,4844.0, Empires at war and where you can like basically customize out different components on your vehicle on these larger like mother
4844.0,4849.24, Right so you can change tactics on the flag is the one thing you point it out that I've always noticed in games
4849.24,4853.56," Is that if you commit to to a a tech tree early on yeah, like your your dead"
4853.56,4856.76, You're just 20 minutes for it to actually happen right they were wow
4857.76,4859.76, Remaining the sounds duty
4860.76,4864.76," So excited is tearing shit up. Yeah, I can't wait to play this game"
4865.24,4867.24," Oh, but me or a ball"
4867.24,4871.44," But okay, but okay, but actually the one thing that kind of got me really into this though"
4871.44,4877.78," The idea of that like there are resources in the game. Yeah, but every faction has a different kind of resource to pull to pull from"
4877.78,4880.219999999999," Uh-huh, so like no everyone gets a different version of dirt"
4880.44,4883.919999999999," Yeah, no fighting over the dirt. Well, no, I like so let me give you an example"
4883.919999999999,4890.66, So the alien hierarchy there their resources pulling like cows and humans and strip mining buildings and stuff basically using the environment
4890.879999999999,4894.799999999999," So if you if you're one of the novice, which is robotic"
4895.679999999999,4899.599999999999," The iPod people basically yeah, that's how the developers call"
4901.5599999999995,4903.44, But the cool so basically what happens is
4904.2,4907.16, The robots they don't rely on the same tech they basically
4907.799999999999,4911.36, They work off power and they have to create a network to be getting more powerful
4911.36,4914.879999999999, So basically they can create a scorched earth theory and like just like
4915.24,4919.44, Lay waste the landscape and force the aliens into a certain area instead of trap form
4919.44,4925.44, It was I thought that was one of the interesting things was that they're making it so like the maps themselves the environments are the
4925.44,4927.28," Resorts, but that thought was a cool idea"
4927.28,4931.28, So they're not gonna be like pools little pockets of mining areas
4931.28,4936.12, It's like the buildings like Darren saying the people the cows will be your energy source
4936.12,4939.44, So so they will be destroyed the cows if you're one faction
4939.44,4944.9, That's exactly the cows so that's exactly it so like imagine like you know you heard the anime toured where you want them to go
4944.9,4946.9, And you have a trap waiting for them so that
4948.179999999999,4956.5199999999995," Crush them when they're not expecting yeah, they weren't that some interesting ideas and like you're saying the ability to shift your strategies on the fly or or shift your"
4957.84,4960.759999999999, You know the way you're gonna lay out your base or well
4960.76,4965.2," They're not bases, right in terms of this one race. It's like this giant moving sort of mac walker thing"
4965.2,4972.4800000000005, You add things to is gonna allow for you to shift strategies midway in the game if you realize your strategy is a losing one
4972.4800000000005,4977.92," So you know, I think that they rightly pointed out the developer rightly pointed out that you can commit"
4977.92,4982.62, You could basically have lost an RTS within the first five minutes without even knowing it yet
4982.62,4986.2, If you've just like taken a wrong tactic right it's a certain yeah and
4986.5599999999995,4992.54, There what the way they're they're trying to design it is that you can recover from that right this game which is an aside
4992.54,4997.0, I've been hearing that the latest patch to company heroes is because company heroes
4997.0,5000.24, We celebrate you for being the type of game that you're that you're applauding right now
5000.76,5005.38, That the latest patches like taking that has taken that away from it made it more like a typical starcraft
5005.38,5008.22, I know I lot of why a lot of complainers out there. I don't know
5008.88,5011.679999999999, I mean the one question it did lead that I didn't ask
5012.400000000001,5021.04," But it made me wonder at the time was well, doesn't that mean that it's gonna be a lot more stalemates now in a way like if if everybody can just keep reacting to the other"
5021.04,5026.9800000000005, I mean obviously that will maybe hopefully with good players turn into just a more challenging match
5026.9800000000005,5027.9800000000005, I mean
5027.9800000000005,5031.68," Right, I mean the way it's obviously like if you are really good and like"
5032.16,5036.26, What the way they're balancing it is by making a big reset button that kind of sucks for the player
5036.26,5041.8," Well, it's not so much a reset button is it it seems to be more like just kind of like being able to whoever can like think in that rock paper scissors"
5041.8,5044.3, Fashion which tactic they need to adjust to
5044.820000000001,5047.46, Really quickly so is it a true stalemate? I don't know
5047.46,5051.74, I mean yeah the fact that it kind of extends the game play beyond just like all right
5051.74,5055.66, I'm screwed him as just kind of like keep base building until I internal until I'm ready to die
5056.9400000000005,5060.9400000000005, It did I just say it did look good. I mean we sit in a lot of them also other time
5060.9400000000005,5065.96, We see a lot of strategy games and this is the first one in a while that that really
5066.820000000001,5073.06, caught my attention and I went into it not having any expectations and not being predisposed to want to like it even
5073.06,5076.34, And I walk out of the ground. Huh cool. We should write about that
5079.9400000000005,5085.34, I can't remember what else I showed that was really relevant to the PC crowd. Well my favorite was a trailer for condemned
5085.5,5087.88, The trailer for condemned was very very funny
5087.88,5089.52, Condemned to this funny funny
5089.52,5095.3," Well, I don't know funny when they were going for but well, I think I hope was supposed to be intensely funny if not"
5095.3,5097.3, Oh
5097.3,5099.58, Then throughout the first one wasn't yeah the first
5100.58,5105.62," serious well, I was it was all that sort of like well it had this voice over that was just like"
5105.860000000001,5108.58, It was over the top hardboiled detective guy
5108.58,5112.26, Is like Michael Meds and I think was the voice doing basically with red with sounded like
5112.26,5118.46," You know basically max pain just bombeted yeah, I tried to do this on one of yours and I totally blew the joke and"
5118.46,5121.46, I'm making a full out of myself. I'm not gonna try to get there
5121.46,5124.900000000001, I feel like the pavement after a pigeoncraft doing me
5125.3,5127.3," Something yeah, every"
5127.3,5133.68," Like that it was a good answer. Thank Miller comic. Yes, yes, let's take change the direction of the franchise"
5133.68,5138.38," No, this wasn't like a comedy. It wasn't like a comedy. It wasn't like yeah, she"
5140.3,5142.3, Was in three-stood desert
5147.7,5153.26," No, I remember like so the first game was basically we were kind of joking before I came out that we hope it doesn't turn into bum fights"
5153.26,5156.6, Which it which invariably it did because it was both
5157.34,5158.860000000001, Because basically all the all the
5158.860000000001,5166.16, The impossible sleuthing stuff wasn't there. It just kind of like yeah walk over the walk over the hotspot hit the button and you find the clue
5166.16,5169.9400000000005, I was I only played the port. I didn't play the console
5169.9400000000005,5176.02," Yeah, I thought the PC version was super disappointing. It did the atmosphere right though, and it did"
5176.02,5178.820000000001, It was kind of weird you know when that came out and fear to me
5178.82,5184.46, They felt like in both games play it could be a complete and that maybe they
5184.46,5189.34, You know of course monolith develop both and if they should have taken elements from both games and yeah
5189.34,5194.0599999999995, I know I mean in the same thing. Uh-huh like the fear team should have been stopping to use some of the yeah
5194.58,5199.92, The detective crap now and then or like add some melee to it and add some of the different environments to you know
5199.92,5205.28, And then vice versa because one was a bunch of good gun fights. The other was a bunch of like mediocre bomb fights
5205.28,5207.219999999999, And the
5207.22,5209.22, The environment could have really shot the bomb
5209.22,5212.1," It really was that game. Oh, you was creepy as hell to me"
5212.42,5217.58," Yeah, you know the one thing I mean condemned was can more disturbing to me that fear which was it all"
5217.900000000001,5222.780000000001," Okay, it was because it's definitely felt more visceral. Yeah, because you actually feel like things were stalking you in the dark"
5222.780000000001,5227.9400000000005, And you're like yeah when you're clocking like you clocked some like Hobo in his head like you could basically
5227.9400000000005,5231.7, Here's tooth fall out on the like the title he's like runs behind a thing
5231.7,5232.900000000001, He's like oh
5232.9,5234.9, Fuck yo
5234.9,5241.0199999999995," And then he goes and hide no they would yell and yeah, and then he would go and hide somewhere and you'd hear him running around in the dark"
5241.0199999999995,5244.36, And he would relocate so you'd be like shit do this like crazy fool
5244.36,5247.339999999999," Then you'd seem to go run in again, you know hold like a locker door or something"
5247.339999999999,5250.139999999999, It feels predatory that was something like those some creepy dudes
5250.139999999999,5252.82," Yeah, and then he's like so when I talked to one of my guys over there"
5252.82,5255.9, He's told me that the basically they're throwing up a baby with the bath water and like start it
5255.9,5258.54, I want to start over and do this game like the justice of the servers
5258.54,5263.28, And you know it I still think there's potential but they really got it like I mean at least what mattered to me
5263.28,5266.28, Like what you were saying or some of those elements from other monolith games
5266.28,5271.0, I'd love to see some like actual honest regards loo thing like like give me it
5271.0,5273.7, Let me make me find the clues make you like actually use well
5273.7,5278.78, That was my whole problem with the game was like that you you know they introduced all these like spy to or investigative tools
5278.78,5281.82," Whatever, but then it was just like just go up to the one press"
5281.82,5285.26, And it was like I'll shit that's no make me do the thing
5285.26,5290.22," That's exactly because I didn't mind us all just been a generic tool. Yeah, I just called tool a little"
5291.22,5300.58, You don't have a press A with your tool take take take your leather man and go scoop up the I didn't matter. Oh great. I'm using the the whatever the you know
5302.58,5308.46, EMG scanner so why I don't do any fucking techniques human feces on the president airplane pillows
5308.74,5310.74, It's it's like it's a black light
5311.74,5315.06, It was like a big knee on arrow saying look here now hit this button
5315.26,5317.26, And that's kind of that's a
5318.02,5323.34, You want to know they do those shows and they like they buy on the black light and those other like devices that they use
5323.34,5326.58, But instead of finding like supernatural presence and some like
5327.26,5329.58, Serial killer they find like human feces on
5330.22,5333.780000000001," Pillows and you know see man on door. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's why whatever"
5333.780000000001,5337.54," Two ships and stuff, you know, hey, it was on like regular like there's a nightmare"
5338.26,5341.62," That's like why don't you why I don't eat bar peanuts. Oh, yeah, yeah"
5341.62,5345.599999999999, Because of all the you know based I grab some salad tongs and you strip off the bed
5345.599999999999,5349.82, The danger with like turning those crime tools into something is like mini games
5350.14,5355.099999999999," But oh, yeah, that's the extreme is the determine like the lock picking game"
5355.42,5362.9," Yeah, that's true. Oh, you may be if they worked in such a way that you could look at it and figure out on your own like which tool would probably be appropriate"
5362.9,5367.0199999999995," Okay, that's the fun the variety of evidence you're looking at yeah"
5367.02,5370.46, Like all of that it would auto select for it you'd have all those tools like you're saying
5370.46,5372.860000000001, But it would auto select that the appropriate tool at the time
5373.26,5378.3," So then it wouldn't be too much of a mini game. You're like okay, like but in some of I don't even know if it"
5378.3,5382.22, It'd abide by it's own logic it seemed it sometimes it was rather like you know
5382.780000000001,5384.780000000001, All over the place an arbitrary with okay
5384.780000000001,5390.5," Well, you're gonna use the black light for this. You're gonna use the right I just didn't even know what once it was like that simple"
5390.5,5396.26," I didn't even know why it was in the game right oh, you're just making me like walk up to this one spot and hit a button"
5396.26,5400.900000000001," Yeah, it was almost some kind of like it was like a cheesy way out of trying to get like"
5401.18,5405.7," Can they more of the story without actually I guess, but at that point it was like tell me what it is"
5407.22,5413.62," Okay, so I can attempt can them to contempt contend what we do like monolith a lot"
5413.62,5415.62," Yeah, so I"
5415.62,5420.74, Take those ideas and put them put a few of them gather a few of them put them on and they also had a very
5421.06,5423.46, Minor teaser announcement that it didn't go too deep into it
5423.46,5430.5, But gas power games is doing their next Rpg with SIGA right and we don't know anything more than that and that's all they're saying right now
5430.5,5432.5, But
5432.5,5434.9, Hopefully don't you see each
5434.9,5436.9, I don't think it'll be done
5436.9,5438.9, I don't think so
5438.9,5440.9, I
5440.9,5442.9, I think it'll be stark
5445.3,5452.34, So hopefully we'll try to get more out of another amount of the supreme or commander down the line or maybe we'll be reading about it and somebody else's mags
5453.54,5459.06," We've never been overly nice. No, that's not true. We were very kind of done to the seed one"
5459.06,5461.46, I think then we were harder on done to see too
5462.26,5465.62, And supreme commander we didn't like as much as some other folks did
5466.82,5468.82, Not too far off there
5468.82,5469.62, I don't think so
5469.62,5472.1, I don't even know we it was like the person that reviewed it for
5472.9,5478.02," That's the frustrating amount of go over that you know it's like this whole notion of there's oh, that's kind of like it's kind of a"
5478.02,5485.620000000001," Contrary to what was supposed to be it one up, but like my mind is like review is attached to the critic who wrote it"
5485.9400000000005,5489.620000000001," The critic who evaluated and responded the game and had that experience, you know, so it's like"
5490.580000000001,5494.740000000001, I mean I don't understand I could have played I play complete supreme commander say this is amazing
5494.740000000001,5498.740000000001," Yeah, I mean I could have done it you could have done it. You know, and it's kind of a lie to say"
5498.740000000001,5503.700000000001," I mean, yeah, it does represent our mags and it's taken on it. We tried that person to write it for very good reason"
5504.179999999999,5508.34," But at the same time, that's just inevitable. There's no it's not like I mean review scores are not"
5509.3,5513.78, What people what some people want them here? You know what I think we should know I mean we should find the
5514.0199999999995,5518.42, Whenever we review a game we should find the person who's most pre-disposed to give it a really good score
5519.22,5522.179999999999, And then give it to them then all the game companies will just like us
5522.82,5524.0199999999995, True
5524.0199999999995,5526.0199999999995, We'll get those exclusive scoops
5527.46,5529.78, Marketing guys are listening to an hour going yes

5537.0599999999995,5541.22," 11 out of 10. I love it. Oh, but I don't even ask what my scores will be on the one"
5541.78,5543.78, What's your score gonna be
5543.78,5544.98, Like
5544.98,5546.98," Oh, I still want to be on the mailing list"

5562.1,5566.9800000000005," It was a win out on the goodbye fuckers, but now drag me now. I don't have closure yet guys"
