51.28,58.08, And with me today are the CGW editors which include the very her suit. Ryan Scott. That's like the
58.08,68.32, evil Ryan Scott actually. Daring Gladstone. The sick as in Ilin and the flu. Sean Elliott. Sean
68.32,73.2, Maloy. Thank you gentlemen. Welcome. I haven't seen you all week. And I missed you. Mr.
73.68,83.04, Pug. Yeah. Ryan Scott. If you don't have a visual on your radio. Sporting a pretty awesome
83.04,89.04, looking go tea. Lee for four days and the man is a kind of mean looking now. Especially with the
89.04,94.88, Sonic the head jog t-shirt. It's like the third time you guys are talking about my t-shirts and
94.88,102.08, the fog t-shirt. We just like looking at you I guess. Also the other item to note at the table here is
102.08,107.67999999999999, Sean Elliott is drinking a Coca-Cola black. Sean Maloy pointed out it's actually Blake.
108.48,112.88, Yeah. It's got it. We'll melt on it. No. It's got something. It's got an exit mark over the A.
113.67999999999999,119.28, Yeah. A K. It's the long A. So that's good. Yeah. Like Adrian called those crap
119.84,125.36, sugar water drinks. So it's got a little coffee flavor going on. It's not going to replace balls.
126.96,131.6, There's the number one land game where's beverage choice. Can we just skip the balls jokes?
132.08,138.56," Yeah. So that's like that was many fun. It's like every time you see someone's like hey,"
138.56,142.96, post a picture of your rig. You always see that empty bottle of balls like up on the counter.
142.96,146.72000000000003," But it's not just like they were just drinking it. It's like they got it one time. They're like,"
146.72000000000003,151.28, this is a cool bottle. I'm going to save this. Might come in handy. I can burn some incense in it.
151.28,154.08, It's like ribbed for her pleasure too. I'm going to let's go to that too. With that.
154.08,159.92000000000002," That too. With don't. Nothing that. No, it's just right. It's got nobs on it."
160.07999999999998,164.23999999999998," Does have no. It does. The bottle has nobs. It does. Yeah. Anyway, sorry."
164.79999999999998,169.04," And okay, before we finish it up since we started our glorious podcast like about beverages."
169.92,173.04, I'm trying to bring it back by bringing it at least into the realm of gaming beverages.
173.04,179.2, But the logo for balls is also like no ahead tennis. You know how the head is like a tennis company.
179.2,183.67999999999998," Yeah. Okay. If you've ever seen their logo, it kind of looks like the name of the company. Anyway,"
183.76000000000002,188.88, actually this Coca-Cola black has a logo that I can't quite make out. You see that thing?
189.28,194.72," Yeah. I don't get it. It's a spell. It's a guild or spell icon. Oh, that's what it is. That's why I"
194.72,201.52," recognize it. So it's cool. Yeah. Okay. Well, enough of that. So I didn't play any games because I was off"
202.24,208.48000000000002, in LA being being a hoe. But what did you guys play? Anybody? There was a lot of cool demos.
208.56,216.07999999999998," Oh, demo week. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Ryan. I played nothing this week. Nothing. That's a whole game."
216.07999999999998,220.95999999999998," He played. He played the role that I heard. Yeah. Here at computer gaming world, we play games."
220.95999999999998,226.39999999999998, That's part of our job. Ryan. Might want to get on that. I'm going to leave a dark
226.39999999999998,231.2," set for you because you play. I play more of it. Actually, you know, I just tried to this bit of"
231.2,234.88," free where I call Fred's a fire. Have you heard of this thing yet? No. Basically, it's guitar here"
234.88,242.48," on your PC. Oh, cool. So it's kind of crazy. Why does that make you say cool? So, so quickly though."
242.48,248.32," Well, because because I'm jealous because I don't have guitar here. Okay. But here's the rock"
248.32,254.4, out with a fake guitar. Yeah. You get to do it with your keyboard. So wait. Let me let me back
254.4,259.6, this up now. Okay. Okay. You could call it. Guys. It's a phone saxophone hero. Whatever. You
259.6,263.2," could call it. Take a low hero, cello hero. I'm thinking of a classic one or here. You're still"
263.2,268.24," typing like the keys on your keyboard. You actually want to like key tar hero. But so yeah, I'm embarrassed."
268.24,274.8," It could be D-dark. What did I say, Cole? I take that. I take that back. It's like, you never."
274.88,278.32, But I know you did. But Jever played D-dark on a controller or an a key move.
278.88,284.8," That's like yeah. You can press up down left, right. Okay. So it does have the cool factor of"
284.8,288.32," the guitar, but it is open source and people are actually already creating their own MP3s"
288.32,293.44," and getting songs to import into the game. This actually, I'm going to give a shout out to"
293.44,298.16, a PC format. You came out using the editor Ed James Carrey. He actually modified a toy guitar
298.16,301.92," with a USB port. So we can actually play the game with it. Okay. No, it's hard. A hot, cool."
301.92,306.72, That's cool. We're we're clapping on your keyboard pretend you're playing guitar is weak
307.12,309.48, Playing on a sorry I'm losing my voice
313.2,315.20000000000005, Here for you
315.20000000000005,317.20000000000005, T-Tar keyboard
317.20000000000005,323.40000000000003," Is dignified right, but I mean that's what the guitar the guitar hero good times like it's like that"
323.40000000000003,327.52000000000004, Fisher price gym right you're not playing the guitar you're like playing red green blue
327.52000000000004,328.88, But yeah
328.88,330.88, Iron man
330.88,333.56, becomes blue red green orange blue
339.88,341.88, Green orange blue
341.88,345.88," Anyway, I can't say I'm a couple of her like take me out on the radio and I still like my fingers are good"
345.88,351.15999999999997, Like start doing it and like looking for that so what about hooking up the official guitar hero thing?
351.15999999999997,354.15999999999997, I was in a doctor where you can get up from PS2 and USB
354.15999999999997,358.86, You know there are there are third party companies making a child. I got to have a stop for a smith
358.88,362.28, There's some sweatshop in China making those guitar right now. That's what we love
362.28,365.88, But then if you already have you know the guitars for your PS2 or whatever
365.88,369.28," Well, I mean it's not gonna work as you need a U.I. You need a USB"
369.28,375.32, Here's why you could bother because PS2 you got those songs they get played out that you know that waiting the entire year for a
375.32,376.32, See yeah
376.32,377.32, That's what I'm talking about
377.32,380.86, Talking about putting on all the German crowd rock you can handle
380.86,382.36, Ramstein maybe
382.36,384.36, Yeah
384.36,386.2, Is there any motorhead in guitar here?
386.2,393.34," Yeah, but a suspicious oh that's a given. Oh, all right. So you have to play guitar here at all. I've never played it"
393.34,396.03999999999996," Wow, so that case you better get a guitar hero one and two's coming"
396.03999999999996,400.64," That's over now that now. Oh, it's the spades is on there. Sweet. All right"
402.28,403.48," Yeah, what else are we playing?"
403.48,409.5, Dark the scia play dark the scia playing company heroes. How is dark Messiah? It is awesome if you haven't played it yet
409.5,414.03999999999996," Yeah, I did you play it. It's why played it in E3. That's what that's all came. Oh, but I mean like it's"
414.6,418.8, Before you know before the E3 demo I was just I was cutting interesting and looking forward to it
418.8,422.82," Definitely thought I was gonna be cool, but after playing I'm like holy crap. This is gonna be a good"
422.82,424.82, huge wow good
424.82,428.64000000000004," Yeah, the combat especially coming off of oblivion in a different games"
429.16,430.68, same point of view
430.68,435.34000000000003," Same setting, but people will insist they're different because one emphasizes the stats more than the other"
435.5,440.58000000000004, But the combat is is much more focused much more responsive in dark Messiah
441.09999999999997,442.09999999999997, combo based
442.09999999999997,444.78," Yeah, I love the combos and like when you pull back when you're holding like"
445.26,449.4, Preparing to strike different poses depending on how you pull back on it and then all that yeah
449.4,452.34, You got the kick there that you can do at the same time as your
452.9,455.09999999999997, As you're swinging your sword or your dagger whatever
455.09999999999997,460.5, So you've got spikes to put you know all these environmental traps that you can not people into you can you know
460.5,462.74, Set your bow on fire if there's a fire there
462.74,467.97999999999996, It's pick up a crate for some reason when you pick up the flask the water jug or whatever and you throw it on someone
468.14000000000004,471.54, It's like hitting with a cannonball or whatever it'll just flat out kill
472.06,477.54," We're the barrel of burning barrel just kind of breaks over their face, but like just don't get water jug will really destroy"
478.06,480.06, tweak in there and
480.06,485.42," So it's just enough to play and say hey, this is responsive. This is cool and and well there's the hack"
485.98,493.26," Yeah, you can basically unlock I'm not sure if it's all the spells in the game, but you can unlock quite a few spells and mess with those"
494.1,497.14000000000004, Those I mean those are one of those are to me
498.14000000000004,503.82, You know hypothetically gonna be the highlight to the game and I've been here and you know mixed reactions to them that they're not as good as the hand
504.14000000000004,505.82, It's the hand-to-hand combat
505.82,510.92, But they should ideally they should be quick and they should work well because it's gonna be all about the combinations
510.92,514.82, You know I remember when we were at E3 together and at the same looking at the same stretch of level
514.82,516.82, we asked the guy to
516.82,520.0600000000001, You know shrink this or shrink this goblin
520.0600000000001,525.0600000000001," Yeah, then telekinetically lift him up the sediment to the fire and then throw him off"
525.1800000000001,526.1800000000001, You know
526.5,529.62," That was pretty cool. Yeah, so what are all these"
531.26,533.26, We're passing notes
533.9,535.26, It's not the exact
535.26,537.76, John's being really boring move on
540.38,543.66," Oh god no, so you're writing down stuff about Jack Thompson"
543.66,546.26," No, yeah, I was like to talk about that world"
548.26,551.26, This guy he doesn't like video games
551.26,553.26, You
553.26,555.26, That's a news for you
555.26,557.26, He's a cranky old man on the one
557.26,560.26, We would have discussed the jack Thompson versus
561.1,566.54," GeForb debate the Adam Sussord debate, but we're not gonna do that now. We're talking about what we're playing now"
566.54,570.06," Yeah, dammit, so save your notes for later, man. Yeah, pay attention"
570.06,573.02, Let's talk about is anyone else playing the company here at this demo?
573.66,574.46, How about beta?
574.46,578.7, Why don't you tell what are that you tell the beta and I've been playing just got the reviewable today
578.7,580.46, So I'm looking forward to checking that out what do you mean?
580.7800000000001,587.4200000000001," Reveal but I mean there are people. Revealable code gold code. Oh, okay. That's interesting that they had sent that today"
587.4200000000001,589.46," Well, maybe so because today in the public beta"
589.46,591.7, They just released a massive massive patch
593.1,598.0600000000001," That's adding some AI and stuff among other things. Yeah, you probably want to add the AI before"
598.46,600.46," Yeah, you got to review now with AI"
604.46,609.1," I'm really digging that what I've played so far. You know, you know, I'm not usually the"
609.58,616.0600000000001," RTS guy and for some reason, you know, usually people are like oh greats world war two and I did a little research and everywhere"
616.0600000000001,621.1, I looked every preview I found it started the same way it's like here's yet another world war two game
621.1,623.4200000000001, except this is the one that we like you know
624.14,627.58, And I even checked out one site. I checked like they had four
627.98,633.02," Previews listed for it and every single one started that same exactly. Yeah, but let me ask you what we do that"
633.02,637.34," It's he did that it all. No, we made a point of like we rock of not doing that"
637.74,643.74," Well, that was that was me did that whole like world war two feature right that's like a rule for for CGW previews people turn them into me"
643.74,650.62, He's like if it's a world war two game if you started off talking about how world war two is played out like that's more played out than a world war two game
652.62,654.62, It actually it actually flip the accent
654.62,658.0600000000001, Also if you start out with Hitler was right we have to change that right or
659.02,660.62, Not killing Nazis never
660.62,664.7, I mean this is different this is not that this that that is whatever do which won't with that
664.7,665.98, But
666.94,669.34," No, I mean like okay, that's messed up"
669.34,673.26, But I mean something else. I was gonna say people right like killing Nazis never gets old
673.26,677.26," Yeah, maybe that's the case, but it's like that. Yeah, that line is old is hell"
677.74,683.66, I think that was old like in like 98 or so that's what I meant by doing won't that was like I didn't want you to think that like killing Nazis
683.66,685.02, Somehow like
685.02,687.66, supposed to be as bad as saying that like whatever by
688.54,690.54, It was right or something
690.54,695.82," You know the converse I could care less, but it's like in terms of it being an interesting thing to read like no"
696.54,702.54, Come up something better. It's like any anyone write about the time splitters console games and they're like monkeys are always fun monkeys never
702.54,708.7," Yeah, that's every so yeah, you're all previews. We're magazine yeah like four years ago played it out"
708.7,711.58, But so anyway the thing bring it back around
712.22,716.62, The world war two angle for company here has works for me and that I can
717.9,723.02, I can say all right look the Americans you know it's asymmetrically balanced access versus all as like say the
723.1,724.38, Americans are making
724.38,732.06, Tanks faster and more economically than the Germans but the German armors better and I can get that that makes sense to me
732.06,736.54, Whereas like the green you know tarragon dragon immediately has a plus five
737.18,741.5, Stand that vanage over the orange like fluff a little they have access to the temporal core
742.06,743.34," Yeah, so"
743.34,751.5," Hello, that stuff I get and the power ups are like it just totally makes sense to me because it's like if if I decide to upgrade along an airborne route and then I start getting access"
751.5,758.7, like the hundred first and I can pick the pair drop in guys and parachute to to short my front lines or give me a you know a little
758.94,763.42, Little extra true wherever I need that's so pretty cool for me. I don't need logic
763.98,765.98, I don't logic either
765.98,770.78, There's a lot of non-logic too. It's like you upgrade it gets ridiculous you start upgrading your engineers
770.78,775.02, Which are kind of like the equivalent of pons. You know the like ready master right kind of
776.46,781.26, And so they get flamethrowers the next thing you see is massive battles where there's like 50 guys
781.26,785.66, With flamethrowers and it's like come on last I heard it was like the M1 was standard American issue
785.66,786.86, Not the flamethrower
786.86,789.42, I'm just gonna get your master's engineering you should get a flamethrower
791.66,795.5, Have you so you've just downloaded this yet play to yet I'm gonna download this figure
795.5,799.18," Oh, I'm kind of curious about how I'm played as a you know because you know"
799.18,804.22," You know traditionally like you don't play many RTS. I mean, how does that feel for the last one I play was warcraft three and"
804.86,808.62, I mean like that horrible Star Wars one. I always have to ask people to remind me which one it was
809.1,814.38, It was about a seven times a dirt go back to battlegrounds. Is that the aid to vampires one?
814.38,816.38," Yeah, that was the joint's chopping down trees"
819.02,821.02, Farming
821.58,826.46," Yeah, seven hundred six. Yeah, there were so many types of like crystals to farm in that game"
826.46,830.46, That's when reason why I was like all right. I'm not gonna play like but as far as as far as like on
831.18,833.42," The way they manage it as you find it like you know, you know"
833.66,839.74, It's got there there are three varieties of resources and you you don't mind any in the sense that you have to have
841.0999999999999,847.9," Engineers were going to and from places, but you basically get you have a map and you have capture points right those then"
847.9,854.4599999999999, Allocate fuel okay ammunition and the other sort of how Donna board it's and it's it's relics so
855.9,860.54," So what happens? Okay, it's right, you know you get this you get these places new builds no observation"
860.6999999999999,865.5799999999999, Opposed on it and you'll accelerate the rate at which you were able to accumulate you know fuel and this and that
866.4599999999999,872.6999999999999, So in the long run you're not supposed to have to worry about that so much other than that just get there first and then that's where you're going to fight
872.6999999999999,874.6999999999999, That's where you're gonna
874.6999999999999,876.6999999999999, Wow
876.6999999999999,878.6999999999999, Sorry
878.6999999999999,885.26, So that's cool. I mean like I ideally I want that stuff in the background because where I'm coming from it's like I want to have these cool tank battles
885.26,890.2199999999999, I want to work on you know different tank tactics and it combined combined forces tactics
890.3000000000001,895.4200000000001, Using the infantry the Panzer Files altogether but the more every time I got to click back to main base and keep saying
895.82,901.34, Build this build that build the other thing make sure you know this kind of taking away from my ability to focus on
901.74,907.9," How precise the battle itself is okay, so basically you don't want to play an RTS right so for me"
907.9,909.5, It's like
909.5,917.9," No, I want strategy you know, okay. I want strategy and tactics is what I'm saying right, but I guess I totally dig it. It's still got it's been out together stuff and"
918.54,923.34, I mean a lot of people that are bent on our boards and whatnot that are like RTS knobs are really digging it
923.34,927.26, They're appreciating the different approach to it and it's definitely an RTS. I mean you play it and
928.38,934.78, I mean it's not it's not as as far away from the RTS you know structure as like a world and conflict or something like that
935.18,941.26, But the other cool neat the cool thing about is like you know when shooters got their physics and everything and that's all played out to us now
941.26,942.38, We're like okay great
942.38,948.14, Barrel blows up and the guy flies but now when you're starting to see all the same things the HDR the normal mapping
948.14,952.14, The physics in an RTS it's really neat on that scale to see
952.78,957.42, You know a tank come through or you call in a quick bombing run and it just blows all the buildings apart
957.42,962.3, Right the trees fly individual guys go flying their vehicles are on fire
962.46,967.82," Yeah, I'm liking that in Titan Quest which is in an RTS, but it's right so yeah imagine that in Titan Quest"
967.82,971.1," But like on an on a much bigger scale, right you know where"
972.46,976.54, So a lot of times it's just you're you're in you know Venture Lord team speak with someone you're like whoa
976.54,981.42, Did you see that or click over here and watch this? I'm calling in a you know a strafing run on these guys and you see your
981.9,986.06, P39 come by whatever wipe out a bunch of infantry that's that's cool
986.7,993.02," But as you're saying yeah, there's still patch it. I mean glad they have an open beta fort because it is asymmetrically balanced"
993.74,995.74, The access and allies play
995.74,997.74, Very differently than one another and
997.74,1003.82, And I mean I don't it's just the two sides right right the two sides and then individually third side
1004.38,1010.86," Well, you can out there allies. I mean what do you can have other access another ally you could yeah outside of Germany in America"
1011.34,1013.5, Does it hence the expansion probably right
1014.14,1016.14, Probably the Italian
1017.66,1018.86, So
1018.86,1022.7, Where was I going with this or something oh so in addition for a traditional variety as
1022.86,1028.46," Your playing you get upgrade points and you can say hey, you know, I'm gonna work on my my airborne division"
1028.46,1034.46, I'm gonna work on my harm or division and then that gives you access to different special powers kind of big special abilities
1034.46,1039.42," Do you get like any like super units? Yeah, so it's the equivalent of that like you mean you can start"
1039.66,1042.54, Equipping your Sherman with collipy rockets which are
1043.1000000000001,1047.18, Basically a bunch of two fired rockets going to top and that's massively devastating and it's like
1047.66,1053.26, So go back to my point. I was gonna say I don't envy any critics that have to review our T.S. as and I say it's because I you know
1053.26,1056.78, I've always reviewed pretty much everything but this right because
1057.3400000000001,1061.1000000000001, You know it's like when you look I'd be balanced as always the big issue in the stuff. Is this fair?
1061.1000000000001,1065.3400000000001, You're gonna end up like trying to like have a patch where they just give up and say okay
1065.3400000000001,1069.1000000000001, You can just play Germans versus Germans or Americans versus Americans because
1069.74,1077.02, It's not the gears aren't measuring it's a lot of work. You're gonna review it fairly incorrectly right and so it's good that they have I mean
1077.26,1085.1000000000001, It's a imperative to have a public beta multiply or beta for any game like this same same is a game like battlefield and they just release now on
1086.14,1094.7," File planet your battlefield 2042 beta, but it's just like I look at that and I play it it seems like how long at what point do you even feel like"
1095.26,1101.42," I can say alright, you know what this works out well these are like the good advantages for this and that and especially when they just keep patching it and stuff"
1101.42,1104.38," Yeah, anyway, yeah cool game cool"
1105.0200000000002,1108.7800000000002, So we'll probably I'll be playing it this weekend except Ryan who I guess I'm not like games
1108.7800000000002,1112.8600000000001, I can go camping me no games for me camping camping like outside and stuff
1113.5800000000002,1115.8200000000002," Wait, what are active too? Wow"
1116.38,1121.1000000000001, So I'll come back and talk about how we can turn it into a video game with them. Call it too big
1121.66,1125.8600000000001," No, I think it's actually whitewater run where you've got the paddle in well with that be a"
1129.8600000000001,1131.8600000000001, We have to lie a paddle
1131.86,1134.8999999999999," Yeah, it's like a queen up only it's like David bus is still"
1134.8999999999999,1137.54, I don't you tell me I've seen that I had no busters
1138.58,1140.58, Mr. Malai
1140.58,1143.86, I've been sucked further into warcraft that never wow
1144.4199999999998,1146.4199999999998," Yeah, well, let me saw"
1146.4199999999998,1150.4199999999998," When I played it came by with burning crusades. Yeah, I got to get my level 60 guy back"
1151.1399999999999,1155.6999999999998," Yeah, I'm back in like a reading guild and I've got my first mulled core run this weekend"
1156.26,1159.62," six months whoa, so that's gonna come to get some dkp"
1160.58,1162.58, Right
1162.58,1169.6599999999999," Oh, does more dots more dots wow, so you got suck back in that happens every time they come around and show that expansion"
1169.6599999999999,1171.6599999999999, I mean it happens with me
1171.6599999999999,1175.6999999999998, You just go oh I got to be ready for the expansion. They did a little crack vial for you
1175.6999999999998,1178.2199999999998," No, I'm like free-stutter retirement"
1179.02,1181.78," Right, saw the horse a workcraft and thought about playing no"
1182.1799999999998,1187.3799999999999," Yeah, should we talk about horse a warcraft? He's playing a different kind of game. What was that did you get the link guys set there?"
1188.3400000000001,1195.38," No, I found that I felt like a fool really deal like the pay was reported earlier this week. They apparently is a I don't know"
1195.38,1199.8600000000001, It's cosplay or just like a porn thing. I'm still kind of figure out what's going on exactly
1199.8600000000001,1203.0600000000002, Veronica it's it's warcraft erotica
1203.46,1208.5800000000002," I'm about to write up my alley. Yeah, yeah, so it's like fully nude like brimming dressed"
1208.5800000000002,1213.94," Oh god or undressed as like night elves. Yeah, well with like there, you know their night elf"

1230.26,1234.4," Actually a real human being yeah, oh that's sad it said"
1235.66,1239.8200000000002," But hey, man, there's people that do I have to pay I mean wood one half"
1239.82,1243.1, I'm sure you would
1243.8999999999999,1245.8999999999999," Right, I'm a let this is yeah"
1245.8999999999999,1249.8999999999999, That's the other team. I'm very interested in covering your product

1258.86,1260.1399999999999, Bed and
1260.1399999999999,1262.3, What is better than fur? Why didn't they call it?
1263.1,1264.1399999999999, You know
1264.1399999999999,1266.54, What did I say world of horror craft?
1266.62,1271.5," Wait a drop of ball now. Maybe that's already trademarked or something. Oh, maybe it is"
1272.7,1275.58, So somebody actually got the idea they thought it would be a good idea
1276.06,1279.34, Let's set up a porn site for like wow
1280.62,1282.62, I look to pretend that they're looking at like
1283.58,1285.8999999999999," Well, they look at a sworn dwarf when you're yes, yeah"
1285.8999999999999,1289.1, That's like you act like this is the first day you've been on the internet
1289.6599999999999,1292.94, Is there naked people on the internet comes to sex?
1292.94,1299.74," Okay, it doesn't even matter there's like you just make up some random thing like if someone's gonna fetish size like beach sand or something"
1299.8200000000002,1302.06, You'll find like a site that's just a bunch of pictures
1302.06,1305.8200000000002, Like sand but what I want to know is do they have every race represented?
1305.8200000000002,1307.8200000000002, I sure hope so. I'll see how to see a torrent
1308.22,1309.8200000000002, That's a lot of people
1309.8200000000002,1312.38, They need to get in time to afford the prosthetics
1313.02,1315.02, For like the chorus
1315.02,1318.8600000000001," Yeah, they just need to get his first. Yeah, troll female troll"
1319.5,1321.5, Hmm
1321.5,1323.5, Anybody borrow it. Let's have a moment
1324.3799999999999,1328.3799999999999," So anyway, yeah, you can know but I mean you think about it like it well not that I investigate these things much"
1328.3799999999999,1334.86, But I mean like for years they've taken like like regular like normal mainstream movies and kind of do they are porn version of
1334.86,1339.1799999999998," No, it's now it's video games. So in all honesty this wasn't really a good podcast topic. No"
1340.3,1345.9799999999998," Just wanted to bring it up. Yeah, all right. Okay. It's funny. So we actually have about a real item"
1346.06,1350.8600000000001, Daring and real item of news. You want actual real no some actual substance. Oh
1351.5,1355.34, Good luck on this. No actually well first of all top of the list fear combat
1357.02,1362.06," If you if you already have fear no big deal, but if you haven't have you haven't plunked down the money yet"
1362.06,1364.46, You can download the multiplayer game totally for free
1364.8600000000001,1369.5, 12 weapon 12 weapons and 19 multiplayer maps and 10 different gameplay modes
1370.22,1373.82, Just down the place that's actually pretty good. Are there that's actually really there?
1373.82,1375.82, Pots in these levels
1376.62,1382.1399999999999, Then you get play single player free technically you could I don't I don't know but the cool part is
1382.1399999999999,1385.82, And I know what you want to play Bob there and it's always like the biggest champion of bots
1385.82,1389.1799999999998," And I'm not a champion of bots player, but like the dumbest thing ever"
1389.98,1391.98, What when was I champion of bots?
1391.98,1397.34, This historically it's like defend yourself man. Come on. You're always like unreal if I know what they like they know
1397.98,1400.7, 90% of the people that buy their game play alone with bots
1401.66,1403.66, Those are the dumbasses. I disagree
1404.22,1406.22, Use me
1406.22,1412.22," Okay, not everyone wants to play against Reel P. Myers. I know that's I just want to like there you go like defend defend"
1412.8600000000001,1417.26," Okay, here it is not everyone wants to sit down and play against a bunch of douchebags online"
1420.06,1424.3, They want to they want to just get a quick fix I want to sit down blow some shit up and then done
1424.7,1427.5," Right, you know, here's a peel for people who don't buy"
1427.98,1430.54, Feel they can hold their own against the people who are playing these things too
1430.7,1436.22," Right, that's that's something. Yeah, well, it's looking me like what what reason would I have like if I jumped on to any"
1436.7,1441.1, Any game like fear or whatever I I have no chance I can't feel people right
1441.1,1443.66, You know everybody on the server is Sean Elliott
1444.3,1445.66, You know
1445.66,1448.46, I'm just well the trick is fun the trick is also like you know
1448.46,1452.94, You know the trick is matching up with people who are like you know also similar skill level
1453.02,1456.7, They have to like really like address I don't want to those servers say new be on that I
1456.7,1463.66," That's a huge thing but for me it's like I mean on on mismatched, you know player base is always a problem"
1463.66,1467.5, As you go in it's in it's not level but the same time spots have just never been a solution
1467.98,1472.46," No, actually I'm the user because they just like learn levels. Yes never satisfied when you do kill them"
1472.46,1477.74, It's not satisfying for me and they're so like but it's kind of like telling silence annoying
1478.3,1480.3," Isn't that satisfying? Yeah, I'm sorry"
1480.3,1486.06," Let's collect like 99 nights or whatever it is for 360 then you'll love bots, you know"
1486.62,1489.82," Yeah, that's a zin exercise and pushing the a spawn a small day"
1490.54,1494.3799999999999, And it cares the world so that was actually a pretty cool was it Vendie hit it or my
1494.3799999999999,1497.58, It's Vendie's call I think that was a nice nice nice smoke. I thought I
1497.58,1501.02, I'll go back and play it again like the last time
1501.02,1505.4199999999998, I'm they have to have patched since then but before you had this really bad spawn system
1505.8999999999999,1510.22, Where there would be you know like five spawn locations fix spawn location
1510.62,1516.94, In the map and as soon as you can figure them out you just sit there with your gun in your grenades and wait and just pile up the bodies like you'd wait
1516.94,1518.94, Like soon as someone would spawn
1518.94,1521.82, Get them get them and then the ragdolls would be like to the seal it
1521.82,1523.1, I'm a two seconds
1523.1,1526.3, You know I wonder if they someone thought of doing like a hidden mod for that
1526.3,1527.98, That'll be I'll be a really good game to do it in
1528.54,1530.62," Yeah, I wonder how difficult it is to mod the"
1531.02,1534.7, The tools are out there so and also I don't know if I mentioned this before but the cool part is
1535.5,1540.06, People who download the free game can play against people who hold the box game so it's like totally okay
1540.3799999999999,1546.78, So you're not segregated so you're exactly the cheap skate that's a good that's a good thing for the people that did buy it to you and who might
1546.78,1550.54," It's a more popular yeah, if you are fewer people online and also this is I mean"
1550.94,1553.5, And obviously this is probably also a move on their part on Vibendee's part
1553.5,1557.74, I should say to kind of build up hype for the bot the expansion coming out. I think October
1558.46,1559.74," Yeah, right what they said"
1561.74,1563.4199999999998, I mean
1565.4199999999998,1566.46, I don't know
1566.46,1567.8999999999999, I mean I mean every game just was like
1568.38,1573.9, There's a many guys are love we will went back in with the level editor and the assets with up a few more levels
1573.9,1575.9, We threw a mini gun in
1576.7,1578.7, You got a mini gun this time yourself cynical
1579.26,1585.3400000000001," No, I'm not because if it's good it'll have my total support and same thing with the fear expansion"
1585.3400000000001,1588.5400000000002, I'll be on this podcast telling you all to get it in this amazing videos
1588.94,1593.26, But if it is just a video if it's just a chain gun and re-skinned levels then
1594.46,1596.46, What good's it gonna do to pretend like it's red
1597.98,1600.94, It's gonna call this game out
1603.5800000000002,1609.18," Any any other news items this week of interest there? Well, I'm just gonna scam through some skip through some stuff here really quick"
1610.14,1614.7800000000002," Okay, Microsoft XNA well it's XNA game studio Express really nerdy stuff"
1614.7800000000002,1618.8600000000001, But this is actually pretty cool if you like freeware games in the developer games that sort of thing so
1619.5800000000002,1620.7, Microsoft
1620.7,1624.7800000000002, Starting August 30th is releasing this basically it's a free game development tool
1625.1,1629.66, So if you want to like make a pretty solid game engine they're gonna have some samples for you and just kind of build off of it
1629.66,1634.94, And an interesting tie in is that if you join something called the the creators club
1635.26,1636.94, I think for a hundred bucks to an annual subscription
1637.42,1642.7, You'll be able to upload your games into Xbox live and play these games on your 360
1642.7,1644.7," Wow, or share them with other people"
1645.26,1649.66, That's pretty cool that are also members of better other subscribers exactly right right
1649.66,1652.78," So here, but you can start selling it on Xbox live. You know if you're ready"
1652.78,1655.02," If it's a good enough game, I'm sure you could approach Microsoft"
1655.02,1658.0600000000002, It's right it's obviously it's a way to get a grassroots effort around
1658.8600000000001,1663.18, You know getting these right getting these games out there and I think it's probably a it's a pretty smart move on Microsoft part
1663.66,1666.7," Well, and you think about it too. I mean, it's a pretty neat I mean"
1666.7,1674.3000000000002, That's the opportunity of giving the tools to anybody yeah to make a game and have it be available on that kind of ends like and a widely accessible
1674.3,1678.78, Equivalent of I mean like home-ruw for a console environment right
1678.78,1680.54, It's just just been out of the question
1680.54,1687.02, And it's done in you know widely accessible skill unless you're right and the fact is you can make a game as fully portable to the console
1687.02,1689.02, Let's just do
1689.02,1691.5, So once again Microsoft does something great
1692.06,1694.06, God we love them
1694.62,1695.58, Wow
1695.58,1697.58, So you're just Mr. Sinnacle

1877.26,1879.26, He actually broke
1879.98,1881.98, I didn't break my monitor
1884.06,1885.66, I've picked up a lot of like
1885.66,1891.02, Bandissie and sci-fi authors into their like ever-quested actions and while addictions delaying their books like a really
1891.34,1893.34, What explain why the book sucks so bad
1894.78,1901.74, And then the dwarf character I hate nothing more there's nothing more I hate that elves then why love
1901.74,1903.74, Brue
1905.18,1907.1," Yeah, you don't really"
1908.3799999999999,1912.86, He's kind of a major author in the sci-fi way. It's just so it's kind of a kind of a
1913.42,1918.06," Pretty big confession of you making yeah, I'm thinking of like the stuff that we get sent like the"
1918.1399999999999,1920.1399999999999, Layer series of warhammer novels
1920.1399999999999,1924.54, Even slayer don't not scaven slayer giant slayer ochre slayer. I don't think there's anything
1924.54,1927.4199999999998, Legy slayer. I kind of seem like like the orkin man
1933.34,1935.34, Bioengineers of new scaven breed
1936.3799999999999,1941.98," Yeah, I mean is there anything that you guys have been and that exists addicted to you couldn't get like your life on with I mean"
1942.46,1947.98, Besides workcraft besides I'll decide well definitely only the years are up in games that have made me not
1948.1399999999999,1950.06," My work yeah, I mean that's a constant"
1954.06,1961.26," There you go, you know what and I think there's some truth to that's how I feel sometimes I think like you know like my mom will go like"
1961.5,1965.58, How come you how come you never like wrote a screenplay like you could have ridden us your good writer
1965.58,1969.74, I'm like well because I'm spending like 40 hours a week like video games
1971.34,1975.98," Of course it's only it you it landed me the video game job, so I guess that's good but"
1976.94,1978.94, Not feel bad about myself
1978.94,1983.9," The screenplay it's a guilt we're sorry mom right the workcraft screen. Oh, there we go"
1983.9,1985.26, Everyone do
1985.26,1990.94," Fissie I'm a mo whatever has guilt over not doing something more productive at least, you know once every day"
1991.58,1993.58, Especially when you do slash played
1993.58,1999.1," Yeah, yeah, first I was in my life that type of game in particular makes me feel guilty"
1999.1,2005.02, Then I mean I know people will not call an MMO but guild wars is probably as close to that like
2005.18,2010.62, Fiendish hellish world I've come and that just miserable wretched despicable
2011.34,2013.34, Rotten world of MMO playing
2014.62,2016.62, Just played
2016.62,2019.9," You know, you know, he was already anyone listening totally talking out my ass. It could be fun"
2019.9,2024.06, But for some reason though when I do play when I do play like guild wars or something
2024.54,2028.46, For a long stretch and I come out of it. I do kind of feel like I'm wiping my you know
2028.46,2034.62," Why be the fog out of my eyes? Yeah, I'm re-emerging into the real world. Yeah, whereas I could do like a four five-hour battlefield stretch"
2034.6999999999998,2036.6999999999998, Turn it off and it's like
2036.6999999999998,2040.4599999999998, It's like I'm ready to multitask immediately and do something else and I just don't I don't know what it is
2040.4599999999998,2045.34, But maybe because I'm like this is the nature of the object talking and talking with people all that I'm playing with the whole time
2045.34,2048.2999999999997, And we're also having side chats about other stuff
2048.2999999999997,2049.3399999999997, You are
2049.3399999999997,2051.74," MMOs too, but you're right though. I think there is something"
2052.38,2055.42, There's more focused action element when you're playing a game like a battlefield too
2055.42,2056.7799999999997, You have like a lot of targets
2056.7799999999997,2061.1, But you ever had that were that weird kind of guilt feeling where at least you you just feel like
2061.9,2065.74, Wow like a big chunk of my time just in front of it every night
2065.74,2068.2999999999997, You know for me was plan decide when it first came out. I mean like I was
2068.2999999999997,2073.3399999999997, You know those before battlefield to ever came along and I wanted to have like that MMO experience but like you know FPS style
2073.9,2075.58, And I was playing that like a fein
2075.58,2079.66," Yeah, well the worst is like but you came away with that guilt too. Well I came in a little slightly"
2080.22,2083.42, I mean I would I would I had one time I played like eight hours straight
2083.66,2086.14," I was just like okay, I need to like walk away right the hell now"
2086.7,2090.7799999999997, Your world of warcraft like this just happened like the other night we go into scolomance
2090.7799999999997,2094.3799999999997, Which is like relate a late dungeon where you already six killed though already
2096.3799999999997,2100.22," Go low, but like it's like a three hour dungeon crawl with like five other people"
2100.22,2101.98, So it's really cool when you're talking to them and you're like them
2102.2999999999997,2105.18, And you get to the end and the only reason I'm there it's not for experience or anything
2105.18,2111.3399999999997, It's because I want my my set hat right this right these set of clothing you need and there's a hat in there
2111.3399999999997,2116.06, And the guy at the end might drop it right so you get through all this stuff for three hours and then you kill the guy
2116.7,2119.1, And it drops the wrong hat and you're just like
2119.8199999999997,2121.8199999999997, Hell that I just do right
2121.8199999999997,2128.06," Right, three hours just gone and that's why people do those kind of runs over and over trying to get that one piece"
2128.06,2130.94, Like when it does drop like you have this like you four a guy
2130.94,2135.42, You're like oh my god screaming monitor and then there's a frenzy and somebody else and then you'll lose it in your party
2135.8199999999997,2137.5," Well, yeah, that's never really happened"
2137.8199999999997,2139.02, I've heard about it
2139.02,2141.02, These ninja looters
2141.02,2141.8199999999997, So
2141.8199999999997,2143.8199999999997, You are one are you you an Intel shooter
2144.7000000000003,2147.6600000000003, We would never do that a sea of it. No never niche all that sharing
2148.1400000000003,2150.94, The pops like you got more on the no
2152.1400000000003,2156.38," I thought Ryan what we're right where you can say something on that yeah, you've sort of been at the edge of your seat here"
2156.38,2158.6200000000003, You want to chime in on this all thing oh well
2159.5800000000004,2162.7000000000003," Okay, well here here's something sad but true. Okay, I've uh"
2163.7400000000002,2167.7400000000002, Way back when like I dropped college classes because of hold them on my wow
2168.3,2170.3, There you go
2170.3,2175.6600000000003, The winner mean like because you were doing so poorly in them because you were playing or because you had a lot more time to play
2176.1400000000003,2180.0600000000004," Kind of both yeah, well I've got multiple friends, but it's okay now"
2180.6200000000003,2183.9," Multiple friends who are you landed it all worked yeah, oh yeah"
2184.3,2187.7400000000002, Like multiple friends who actually dropped out of college because of like I'm bud
2188.3,2194.3," You know text only like last time yeah, I take it. I don't apologize for saying despicable and rich"
2195.26,2201.34, Can be it's like it was really bad for this one friend where you really get sucked into like this is
2201.34,2206.38, And this is like a text based thing based on like the week of time books that we were like playing on the site
2206.38,2208.38, And that was like oh
2209.34,2211.34, That's that's a case where I would have been better
2211.34,2219.34, I had the author and not just don't contribute to society that point just please keep playing
2219.7400000000002,2223.6600000000003, I just thought getting back to the original thing. It was interesting that even admitted it that way
2223.74,2227.3399999999997, Right like I mean how how thrilled was this publisher to hear that that day
2227.74,2228.7799999999997, You know
2228.7799999999997,2230.2999999999997, You said
2230.2999999999997,2235.2599999999998, I've had carpal tunnel something it's a setup because next book is about game addiction
2235.2599999999998,2239.66, So I've been struggling with you know the plot or something right right
2239.98,2241.8999999999996, I've hit a crucial you know
2242.14,2247.3399999999997, crucial wall in the plot development instead of oh but it's a whole-point game story for some
2247.42,2252.2999999999997, Now for some entirely dubious pops like college yet say that maybe I don't feel the guilt when I come out of bow
2252.38,2255.1000000000004, Feel because in my mind I guess it's to prove
2255.7400000000002,2263.1000000000004," Okay, I'm the more like dexterous or the more skilled or I I was I outthought this person and so over the course of a battle"
2263.1000000000004,2267.6600000000003," It's like okay, we're gonna win we're gonna kick these guys asses and that's what I'm getting out of it as opposed and I go away"
2267.6600000000003,2272.46, And I said whether our winner loss it's like sports and then I'm just trying to like throw some test-offs
2272.46,2274.1400000000003, I mean they make it sound like it's right
2274.86,2278.7000000000003, It's supposed to like man I spent six hours for a fake hat
2278.7,2280.7, Why
2284.2999999999997,2287.8999999999996, But it's a pretty head well there. Why was all about a lot of his grinding you know
2287.8999999999996,2293.4199999999996," Yeah, you're getting a beginning middle and you're playing a match. Yeah, whereas we're just like yeah"
2293.58,2297.58," Maybe if I was PvP in a while or something I would have a different yeah, he came out of it"
2298.7799999999997,2303.66," Feel proud yeah, yeah, because it's just like that distant light at the end of the tunnel in the memo"
2303.8999999999996,2308.54, That never receipts right I mean as you get closer it goes further. There's a little light carrots
2309.66,2315.18," Yeah, you know that's what it scares me that the shooters are going in that direction with like the the equivalent of the hats"
2315.58,2321.8199999999997, Like they already announced dice announced that if you when you buy a battlefield 2042 if you have a registered
2321.8199999999997,2325.5, Certain number of hours of play in battlefield two you're going to get
2326.14,2328.7, Special items you're gonna get a special victory dance
2329.2599999999998,2332.46," Wow, so you're great. You're gonna want this. I don't want that"
2333.66,2339.18, So it's a play 2042 and a way because in addition you're gonna get some some other kind of badge or a rank
2339.18,2342.94, That's like you know you're a veteran of the battlefield two tour the team begging tag
2343.5,2347.02," Yeah, the dance yeah, it's like you get some super dance to like celebrate the and"
2348.22,2351.42, Jesus people again are gonna want that it's gonna go in that direction
2351.42,2355.58, Why the achievement system unlike Xbox live is popular name there you go psychology
2357.58,2360.3799999999997, Scary so I guess tomorrow here is gaming is bad
2360.94,2362.94, All for you
2362.94,2365.7400000000002, We recommend you stop now or go to the end with your life
2366.86,2370.78, Go to the addiction clinic and Sweden don't play games don't listen to gaming podcasts
2371.82,2373.82, It's just the context
2373.82,2376.38, Educational podcasts why are you listening to and you gotta
2377.02,2379.6600000000003, If you're lucky enough to have a book contract just yeah
2380.06,2385.02," Meet it fulfill it and don't play games to the point where you can't do that. Yeah, you're just the same as like"
2385.34,2390.62," Hey gaming's good, but you know everything like moderation, but so these are good or televisions good"
2390.62,2394.82, But it's not a sitting watch Jerry spring or every single day from you know
2394.82,2398.22," Instead of writing your book get up. Yeah, it's time you go to bed. Okay"
2398.78,2401.2599999999998," So it's not like yeah, don't don't don't create some"
2402.54,2407.06, Gaming still is good then so it's our podcast. I'm giving you the guy
2407.06,2411.38, Barnett thumbs up from showing we're good enough. Are you giving we're smart enough?
2412.34,2417.2999999999997," Okay, so do we maybe should we move on to a couple of reader questions? Absolutely sure. Okay, I was awesome"
2417.2999999999997,2421.94, I was perusing the reader questions and there's quite a whole bunch of good ones this this

2478.2599999999998,2482.2599999999998, Right should you wait for Vista? This is his question should you gamers wait for Vista?
2482.8199999999997,2488.42, Well actually what I'm hearing now is that if you get if you if you buy a PC like an October or something
2488.42,2492.3399999999997, They're gonna start handing out coupons for free Vista upgrades after the fact
2493.06,2497.46, Right because you can actually do it now. So you can actually worry right while I would say you can't do it now
2497.46,2501.7000000000003, But if you wait like a October because basically that's the I was the original plan a lot of
2502.42,2506.02, PC manufacturer gonna be a little cheesed off because Vista's running them far behind
2506.9,2511.54," The ramp up to Vista with games is gonna be a while yeah, but but the fact is"
2511.7000000000003,2513.2200000000003, The fact remains like they're there
2513.94,2516.98, Just but any high-end PC that you buy now is gonna be a little bit visited just fine
2517.7000000000003,2521.46, But the longer you wait obviously the more powerful machine is gonna be cheaper so right
2521.7,2528.42, You can hold up a few months due so that's it so so wait for the Vista wait wait wait for the Vista coupon
2528.7400000000002,2531.86, We're gonna miss a coupon there you go wait for a procto number two
2531.86,2533.86, I think he should just buy a high-end PC
2534.82,2539.38, He could okay so number two is when did you guys first know that you wanted to write for CGW
2540.7400000000002,2542.98," Man, that's when you were out of work"
2544.9,2547.14, When Burger King fired you interviewed me
2548.1,2552.74, Anybody have a good answer you're in the hot seat you're the most recent
2552.74,2556.5," Yeah, that's actually joined show me boy first last in first answer"
2558.42,2561.7, When no when the ad went up for the job
2564.2599999999998,2566.2599999999998, Kind of I mean
2566.2599999999998,2569.06, You got across my mind that I would be going to CGW
2569.06,2571.7799999999997, I don't think honestly any of us can say like one day
2571.7799999999997,2573.06, I'm gonna write for CGW
2573.06,2575.06, Never like a dream
2575.06,2578.42, Right for CGW specifically because I was in the game business for a while and then I
2579.2999999999997,2585.22, Got out of for like a year and then I was just kind of it and get back in and this was kind of at the right time
2586.1,2588.34, And it was amazing that I respected so
2589.38,2593.2999999999997, It wasn't like I just like it really was like you know a couple minutes before the interview were like hey
2593.2999999999997,2595.2999999999997, That would work
2595.62,2599.46, Orion you had come from you were just doing stuff on the web weren't you at the time
2600.42,2606.58, Why was I had written a bunch of reviews for a couple of different fan sites. I was helping out
2606.7400000000002,2608.1, But this is like your first
2608.1,2615.54," In an attempt to get into the industry, but yeah quite the success story there. I knew I wanted to write for CGW when I applied for the internship"
2616.5,2618.5, So true
2618.5,2620.5, True true
2620.5,2624.5," Well, I don't know I guess for me. I was I mean I've been reading the magazine forever so I mean I"
2625.06,2631.3, I never really thought I actually I always just wrote as a hobby when I was growing up and I never actually thought of it as a real career until I graduated from college
2632.58,2634.58, But I guess that's your uh
2634.58,2638.42, J school I should say they once I went to j school. I was like okay now that this is a real career. I can do
2639.3,2640.18, Then I just stay
2640.18,2641.54, It's a journal. I'm not
2643.14,2645.7, Juskool I start smoking both is juskool
2647.94,2649.94, I don't know just kind of happened
2649.94,2651.78," uh, yeah me too"
2651.78,2653.78, Sean well you were an EGM
2654.1000000000004,2659.3, Right so I think that's probably like when people ask these kind of questions with they're getting it as the whole like how do you manage
2659.3,2660.26, Straight-to-go ahead again
2660.26,2663.78," Yeah, if there's that that case where you're like you know I always grew up reading this magazine"
2664.1000000000004,2669.2200000000003," And it's pretty crazy to you know for this one day happens and I'm like, I'm hanging out with these guys actually work here"
2669.2200000000003,2672.98, You know yeah some kind of version of that happened for me at EGM
2673.46,2676.82, Because I was like I said I admit it. I was late to PC gaming and uh
2677.6200000000003,2680.34, But it's kind of weird because by the time I did that it come
2681.1400000000003,2685.6200000000003, It's only magical when you're imagining I think in your high school or something like that you know and then by the time you got
2685.6200000000003,2688.7400000000002," Yeah, I got my second degree and it's got to have a master's program and then it's like"
2689.3,2697.1400000000003," Well, it's about frickin time. I got a salary job. You know it's not it's not like wow you know my dreams are coming true. Yeah. Oh, all right and then"
2698.9,2707.06, On the really like just the flat matter effect and I knew I wanted to start writing for CGW and pretty much anyone who would take my writing when I got late off
2707.62,2709.62, From you GM
2711.62,2717.14, entire me and then beyond that like it was I mean all that time I was already getting
2717.62,2723.14," Just go from people at EGM like when you're just PC gamer anyway, you know and like I hated that anyway because"
2723.7,2727.38, In the same way that's why here I tried to I tried to cultivate like the the whole like
2727.86,2732.58, RTS people versus FPS people versus MMO people whatever is opposed to the console versus
2733.14,2735.94, PC or something because to me it's like I just play it if it's good
2735.94,2741.54," I think that's a kind of like tongue and cheek do it on the in terms of genres for us, but like seriously"
2741.54,2746.98, I just didn't but so it was like it was a good fit it was perfect timing. I looked out because like right when I was
2748.18,2752.8199999999997, Ready to go gungo I threw somebody through through an opera my way
2753.54,2757.46, Get out and then extremely happy ever since go live to don't hit your ass
2758.42,2761.7799999999997," Now I think that was one was that one Robert left. Yeah, yeah, yeah"
2763.54,2765.54, Who were still friends with that?
2767.54,2771.86," All right, let's get to Daniel's number three question. This might just be all about Daniel this week"
2771.86,2775.14," But if his fourth question, I think is probably pretty interesting. I like that"
2775.7,2778.9, We'll get well the three first and then hit for we'll try to do three quickly
2779.2999999999997,2784.42, If you guys had to choose one of the upcoming consoles which would you choose 360 ps3 or we
2784.8199999999997,2791.54, We are 360 so I don't I don't I have a 360 I do I do I do I do I think they're on and Sean and Sean have three
2792.66,2797.06," Now is not the PS3. I mean, I want the way just because like they like"
2798.02,2801.62," Innovation lover in me things could be awesome, but I'm still improving"
2801.62,2806.9," I'm curious about the tech and I think you know blue I could very well be the next beta max, but I'm I'm can I just check it out still?"
2806.9,2812.66, I am unsold on the PS3. I think it's gonna be the Wii for me. It's the big question the PS3 the Xbox is a
2812.66,2817.14, No-brainer we the same thing and the Wii I look at is the ideal game to play you know
2817.14,2820.18, I live with live with like girlfriend and
2821.14,2826.02, Nintendo's been always the perfect like the way to get her to play games with me and aside from like you know
2826.18,2828.8199999999997, Being dark now to guitar here or something together with PlayStation
2829.22,2832.5," It seems just like a dream come true for that, you know, it's like instead of hey"
2832.5,2837.06, What do you want to watch whatever and like and if it's not a matter of layout and it let's go out somewhere
2837.06,2839.54," It's like hey, let's play the Wii or whatever right ps3"
2840.3399999999997,2844.4199999999996, Little too costly and a little too little to show right now to get me really excited
2845.46,2848.8999999999996, More a metal gears get to come out and all that stuff but like for the time being
2849.54,2853.38, You know this holiday season when it's like you know gears of war this and that and then like
2853.94,2856.42, It's Sony's launches have always been just horrendous anyway
2856.42,2859.78, I mean remember playing fan division and stuff and pretending to like it right I came out
2859.78,2862.82, I think the only game I remember like in the PS2 is like SSX
2863.62,2867.94," Yeah, that was exactly that's exactly my point the first one it first came out"
2867.94,2871.7000000000003, I mean compared to the Dreamcast it was so and it's kind of weird it's like you know
2871.7000000000003,2873.54, I think a lot of us want to side with
2874.1,2878.02, The underdog at some point and I think Sony's just kind of like overstayed its welcome
2878.02,2883.22, They've been on top now for for two generations and I think I think I think as I had an awesome launch line up
2883.22,2887.8," We would be for it right, but it's just their their arrogance at the E3 X"
2887.8,2889.3, Boat
2889.3,2893.7, I think it was E3 for me because I was like I came back from that and immediately went about the 360
2893.7,2895.7, Because I've been planning while time delay
2896.1,2901.38, That's a spy the ps3 until they announced the price and showed the games off and like so you believe it
2901.38,2903.78, 2000 was it 2004
2903.78,2906.2599999999998, 2005 you must have believed there's Sweel in
2906.7400000000002,2908.7400000000002, CG movies then
2908.7400000000002,2915.46, I didn't even I think I was the game because I saw those I was like I'm getting a 360 because I knew it was all
2915.46,2919.46," All right, fake I knew it right you've been a little quieter. What are you 360 games?"
2919.46,2922.98, I can you come forward with a ps3 love or is it unanimous sir?
2923.5400000000004,2928.26," ps3's way too expensive. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't I get afforded, but they're not like I said"
2928.26,2932.1000000000004, I'm not I don't you're the arrogance whatever I'm just waiting to see if the games the games do the talk
2932.1000000000004,2936.0200000000004, Well the truth is ultimately we will probably everyone at this table will own all of them
2937.2200000000003,2942.5, Because that's the kind of people it will be a record for me if I don't get it at launch it will be the first
2943.2200000000003,2946.0200000000004, Major console that I didn't get an launch interesting
2947.0600000000004,2951.94, In pretty much ever I mean like by say major so it's like you know excluding the jai wearing the 3DO
2952.1000000000004,2956.82," Okay, but everything that's made everything that you know everyone else that's ever been a contender"
2957.46,2961.0600000000004, I've gotten on a launch day and this is the one where it's like I just don't I just don't care right now
2961.0600000000004,2964.1000000000004, I see like a year from a year from this holiday season caring
2964.42,2969.94, But right now no I also can't recall like this level of cynicism this late in the game for a
2970.18,2973.7999999999997, Consuls release like usually we're all pretty much ready to buy right right
2974.42,2978.66, I think it's the price factors. We kind of like kept the most people way so much money
2979.2999999999997,2983.54, And they're so they're bank I so do corporate wise is banking so much on the blue ray technology
2983.54,2988.98, They don't get along that's awesome good games and I mean what is there gonna be that's that's another thing
2988.98,2993.14, I think for me like Japanese developers have lost a lot of luster
2993.54,2996.3399999999997, Over the years excluding the guys that make resin evil
2997.14,3002.66, Giman company a cat and economy that make metal gear a lot of the stuff where it's Japanese
3002.66,3005.06, You know third party developers would would come out some
3005.62,3011.8599999999997, Consistently some really interesting stuff these days. It's like you know dynasty warriors clones and stuff like look at the stuff
3012.1,3014.58, Aside from dead rising you know like chrome hounds like
3015.14,3018.9, They're just dumping a lot of stuff and they're having a hard time keeping up with like trans
3018.9,3022.3399999999997, You know in terms of their safe systems in terms of like interfaces
3022.42,3028.5, I mean not to do too much to pan bashing but I mean just basically in the strength of their the third party stuff
3028.5,3033.3, We're in the past you'd be like well you can count on all that on Sony. It's just not that attracted to me anymore
3033.3,3035.3, You would say number one
3035.3,3039.38, Except for me or you know ever you're up every you know it's not just yeah
3039.38,3041.7000000000003, It's North America and Europe at least in my mind
3042.26,3046.98," With again, so people don't come yelling at me right about here. Yo Kujima went about you know"
3047.3,3049.6200000000003," Good cheats. I guess okay, don't you got those guys"
3049.8599999999997,3055.14," But I'm talking about the people that make well even music. You look at 99 nights, you know right yeah, it's piece of crap"
3055.2999999999997,3060.74, So it's not like it's like crap with corn and it it's like okay
3062.1,3066.98," That's how it turned a bad coin. It's not the way yeah, I'm buying the way I launch"
3067.62,3074.18, If you got a 12 year-old daughter and like Sean like that the Nintendo machine is always the one I had to playing with my kid and
3074.42,3079.14," I'm really psyched about it. Yeah, there's a lot of fun games. I tried out at any three this year. Yeah"
3080.1,3085.2999999999997, But like we said we will all probably have all of them all have a PS3 eventually when the price goes down
3085.2999999999997,3088.3399999999997," There's a weird stigma attached to getting a pendo stuff, you know"
3088.8199999999997,3095.22, For me at least like when you go because it's just the degrees is little grommets of the internet are all on the Nintendo ban wagon
3096.02,3098.2599999999998, I don't grease the grommets forever
3098.2599999999998,3103.62," Good, but they're different. There's a zeal that the Nintendo ones have that you will not find elsewhere"
3104.02,3106.98, And it's like a self-righteousness. I think the moniesness where they're like
3107.62,3113.7, You know this this is purity. This is innovation. It's not really next gen if it's just an upgrade it has to be a rebel
3113.7,3115.7, Oh shit
3115.7,3121.7, Like that kind of stuff. This is what has slapped them so I'll have to buy my Wii it like a best buyer something not not in a line
3121.7,3125.38, It a game stop where have to hear the clerks say why is choice
3129.38,3130.98, I would buy it
3130.98,3132.98, I was there
3132.98,3136.7400000000002, What I would buy the next Nintendo system just for Zelda's and Mario
3136.74,3143.14," Yeah, because I still always love those can need to so I got to play those right away and the fact that they're like doing something crazy with the controller and interface"
3143.14,3144.3399999999997, Just this
3144.3399999999997,3146.3399999999997, Extra awesome this
3146.3399999999997,3147.54, I'm a fanboy
3147.54,3149.54," Yeah, I can do yeah"
3149.54,3151.54, He's a dude. He was just making fun of each other
3151.54,3154.8199999999997," Okay, so let's do question four and then prop maybe call it a rap"
3154.8199999999997,3160.1," Yeah, that's a good Daniel's question number four is what does your family think of your career?"
3161.06,3163.06, Good question
3163.06,3165.06, Ryan that's right with you
3166.8199999999997,3169.8599999999997, My family's good with it. You leave my mom out of this
3171.2999999999997,3173.2999999999997, Hey now come on
3173.2999999999997,3179.3799999999997," Do they think it's cool? Are they they're not embarrassed? No, they're always they're always really really happy my mom"
3179.54,3184.58, So he's looking for CGW on the new stand not does she read it not always finding it
3185.8599999999997,3191.4599999999996," Soon enough yeah, yeah, yeah, they're always showing it to people at work. I guess"
3191.8599999999997,3193.8599999999997, Then I think when you're gonna get a real job or
3194.58,3196.58," No, they they"
3196.58,3204.58," Technology is that this is kind of this is it yeah, I mean they always used to tell me oh, you know you'll grow out of those games when I was when I was a kid"
3204.58,3206.58, But I showed them
3206.58,3208.58, You've had about G I Joe too
3217.46,3222.82, Um my parents they they laugh about it because they they kind of knew early on for me because I was like
3222.82,3226.5800000000004, I was a big nerd always played with the stuff. I always trying to like figure out how to make things and
3227.2200000000003,3230.42, And they bought me that I'm sorry it's a Tari VCS back in the day and
3231.3,3236.6600000000003, It was pretty much fit a complete ever since then so what do they think it's a cool career what they be happy if you were it
3236.98,3239.6200000000003, Whenever well to be honest with you like the New Yorker what yeah
3240.9,3246.1800000000003, When I first started told him I was gonna be a writer. They're like okay. I was working for like you know book publishers and Manhattan and
3246.9,3251.3, I don't know I just didn't really work for me and then when I said I'm gonna move out west and work at video game magazines
3251.78,3256.9, They didn't quite get it. I still don't think they do but they they respect the fact that I'm you guys
3256.9,3260.1000000000004, You guys still get the so you play games from a living
3260.5,3265.78," Far living from your families to the like reduce a down to that. Yeah, I think now I've explained what I do enough"
3267.78,3272.9, My parents like it's not even that they just don't understand it all. They just know video games isn't involved
3272.9,3278.1400000000003," Yeah, that's really how many times I'll explain even to my own mom on the phone. I mean she it's sometimes it's weird"
