104.0,105.0, Hi.
105.0,106.0, Hello.
106.0,108.0," Desmond, can you tell us where you're at?"
108.0,109.0, Desmond.
109.0,111.0, Are we going to do what?
112.0,113.0, I've never mind.
113.0,114.0, Lost.
114.0,115.0, You look constant.
115.0,116.0, Long related joke.
116.0,117.0, You and your was just because he doesn't.
117.0,119.0, He doesn't know what time it is.
119.0,121.0," You know, I'm back in 2006 now."
121.0,123.0, Why you said an anchor of some sort.
123.0,124.0, Yeah.
124.0,125.0, Elliott.
125.0,126.0, My anchor.
126.0,127.0, Thank Jeff.
127.0,128.0, Elliott.
128.0,129.0, Yeah.
129.0,133.0," So yeah, when I got my start at C.G.W."
133.0,134.0, In 96.
134.0,136.0, Elliott was kind of.
136.0,139.0, I guess we were like the two associate editors back then.
139.0,140.0, Is that right?
141.0,142.0," You know, I was just a bit."
142.0,143.0, Maybe I just sat next to you.
143.0,145.0, You might have said I was still assistant.
145.0,146.0, I actually.
146.0,147.0, Where are you?
147.0,149.0," Yeah, because the more senior staff said I had to pay my dues."
149.0,151.0, And I have to work there for many years before I get promoted.
151.0,152.0, I think it's just because you're a minority.
152.0,154.0," Yeah, that's probably right."
154.0,159.0, You don't promote the the the non white staff.
159.0,164.0," So in the all days, we used to play games all the time at work."
164.0,165.0, That's all we did.
165.0,166.0, That's all we did.
166.0,168.0, We squeezed some work into the game playing.
168.0,169.0, It's not only not that way now because we don't do that.
169.0,171.0, Even though Sean Elliott always tries.
171.0,173.0, I don't believe you.
173.0,176.0, You tell me you really will seriously do we play games at work?
176.0,178.0, I think it's not a whole lot.
178.0,179.0, It's not a whole lot.
179.0,180.0, Yeah.
180.0,183.0," We would sometimes like Jeff, myself, Dave Salvador,"
183.0,186.0," tech editor, we would be in the lab playing Quake."
186.0,190.0, Deathmatch from probably 10 until two or something.
190.0,191.0," Yeah, even more of that."
191.0,193.0, We'd literally for the whole week.
193.0,194.0, It was so bad.
194.0,195.0, It was a cool.
195.0,196.0, Elliott and I drove in together.
196.0,197.0, And we would go.
198.0,200.0, From the car.
200.0,205.0, Two are cubes where we would just drop off our backpacks and go straight into the lab.
205.0,208.0," Because in that those days, we had like a lab with like, you know,"
208.0,211.0, whatever eight PCs all network together.
211.0,213.0, We would go straight in there and just play Quake.
213.0,215.0," Yeah, the second week came in."
215.0,217.0, It was like just like we worked at an arcade.
217.0,218.0, Like in this play.
218.0,220.0, Were you working on a Quake article?
220.0,221.0, No.
221.0,222.0, Nothing to do with anything.
222.0,223.0, Yeah.
223.0,225.0, It was I don't even know how do we do that.
225.0,228.0," I mean, you look at the edges we made and they're like 350."
228.0,229.0, How many does it do you have?
229.0,230.0, But percentage were these three.
230.0,234.0," Well, they were like 14 or 15 people on the staff."
234.0,236.0, So we didn't have a look at the countenant.
236.0,237.0, Really.
237.0,239.0," And more than half of those pages were advertised,"
239.0,240.0, too.
240.0,241.0," Yeah, probably."
241.0,243.0," I mean, it was still like a lot of bang for your buck."
243.0,244.0, Yep.
244.0,247.0," You know, you're making me sad because it's like last week."
247.0,250.0, I was able to sneak over to Richard Lee's area.
250.0,252.0," You know, the might sheets guys, we're playing so countenance too."
252.0,255.0," But yeah, outside of catching you guys playing a little bit of world of work."
255.0,256.0, Craft now and then.
256.0,259.0, I can't get anyone in this in this building online to play.
259.0,260.0, Yeah.
260.0,264.0, I guess the advantage we had back then was there really were a lot of editors.
264.0,266.0, So you could have like a decent multiplayer match.
266.0,267.0, Yeah.
267.0,270.0, We would have all eight stations just filled up with.
270.0,271.0, Right.
271.0,272.0, Yeah.
272.0,273.0, Yeah.
273.0,274.0, It's really true.
274.0,276.0," In fact, it was almost like an arcade because you'd have dudes waiting to sit down."
276.0,277.0, Yeah.
277.0,279.0, To get in on the land match.
279.0,280.0, Yeah.
280.0,282.0, There are art guys playing on the River Joe Joven Lena.
282.0,284.0, The other thing is there were some classic foils.
284.0,287.0, There were like one or two guys on the staff and I've mentioned this before.
287.0,289.0, Who were complete total poor sports.
289.0,291.0, So you wanted to play.
291.0,292.0, Yeah.
292.0,294.0, Just for the opportunity to make them feel shitty.
294.0,295.0, I know you're talking about.
295.0,296.0, Yeah.
296.0,297.0, That's okay.
297.0,298.0, I wouldn't mention Dave by name.
298.0,299.0, Yeah.
299.0,301.0, I was so shit.
301.0,302.0, Yeah.
302.0,308.0, Like in righteous anger when he would get fragged.
308.0,309.0, Yeah.
309.0,313.0, Every time he never was fragged honestly once never ever ever.
313.0,314.0, Ever.
314.0,317.0, You were always either sniping or camping.
317.0,318.0, Yeah.
318.0,319.0, Exactly.
319.0,320.0, Never.
320.0,321.0, You never got him.
321.0,322.0, Honestly.
322.0,323.0, Yeah.
323.0,324.0, If I can't.
324.0,325.0, I can win too.
325.0,326.0, I'm yelling.
326.0,327.0, Yeah.
327.0,328.0, So I don't know.
328.0,330.0, We don't want to make this be a total old man.
330.0,332.0, The stop to fest while the three guys here are going.
332.0,333.0, Yeah.
333.0,334.0, That's great.
334.0,335.0, Yeah.
335.0,336.0, He hung.
336.0,337.0," Anyway, back on earth."
337.0,338.0, Yeah.
338.0,339.0, But it was a fun time though.
339.0,342.0, It was a good to great to work on the magazine.
342.0,343.0, I really don't.
343.0,347.0, I honestly don't remember now how we got all those pages done.
347.0,352.0," Well, you know what they, well, you and I probably were responsible for at least like 50, 60% of it."
352.0,353.0, We just.
353.0,357.0, We would write a lot of shit and then hope no one saw it and just put it in the magazine.
357.0,358.0, We did write a lot.
358.0,361.0," And I would say it's really was it was very, very, very different in those days."
361.0,364.0, What was that red caption that you wrote that we were looking at the other day?
364.0,365.0, My god.
365.0,366.0, It was for an Olympic game.
367.0,369.0," That was the caption said, desk is amongst yourself."
369.0,370.0, This gets amongst yourself.
370.0,374.0," And then the other one was for a soccer game and it said, pay lay with me."
374.0,375.0, Oh.
375.0,376.0, Yeah.
376.0,379.0," Well, that was the time of puns."
379.0,380.0, Yeah.
380.0,382.0," You know, every headline was a pun."
382.0,385.0," Every, you know, we in fact, we didn't have like, that was a big deal."
385.0,387.0," And see, do you have you changed from doing that?"
387.0,390.0," Like the game, like the reviews in the reviews section."
390.0,392.0, Every headline was a pun.
392.0,393.0, It was a normal mandate.
393.0,394.0, It was a mandate.
395.0,397.0, Johnny said you had to have something clever or something fun.
397.0,398.0, Yeah.
398.0,402.0," And it would all be once like now we would just be, wow."
402.0,407.0," So then when we changed to just have it be like whatever fall out to,"
407.0,408.0, Yeah.
408.0,409.0, Then we got like hate mail.
409.0,410.0, Yeah.
410.0,412.0," You know, because we were like bleaching the personality."
412.0,413.0, I hated it.
413.0,415.0," I wasn't on staff at the time, but I saw that."
415.0,417.0, You hated that we changed away from the puns.
417.0,420.0," Well, could you have, could you have the pun in the subhead?"
420.0,422.0, I think you could.
422.0,423.0, No.
423.0,424.0, You have that as well.
424.0,425.0, Right.
425.0,426.0, It's not comedy zone.
426.0,427.0, I have.
427.0,428.0, Exactly.
428.0,431.0, Just like right before in the magazine that's never coming out.
431.0,434.0," We had Sean, maybe, did the story on the least funny."
434.0,435.0, These are just Larry Gags.
435.0,438.0, And we had those three renders of characters when we just Larry in the last.
438.0,439.0, Yeah.
439.0,440.0, From the first coming game.
440.0,445.0," And they've decided to, it's weird hybrid between the stylized cartoonish look of the game."
445.0,450.0," But then also, you know, normal map maps, you know, 3D rendering."
450.0,456.0," And so the Larry's uncle or whatever the whatever this character is, is the most gross test nasty thing ever."
456.0,460.0, But we're continuing to refer to him as like a trash bag full of tapioca.
460.0,462.0," Because he basically, I don't know."
462.0,463.0, That's what he looked like to.
463.0,464.0, Yeah.
464.0,465.0, Just like with all the rumbles and the.
465.0,466.0, It's pretty wild.
466.0,468.0, But there was like a running gay with that.
468.0,470.0, And it's going to be lost to time now.
470.0,472.0," Well, it'll show up online on it."
472.0,473.0, I don't know.
473.0,476.0, That's very specifically to the layout.
476.0,478.0, It's a very print joke.
478.0,479.0, Maybe so.
479.0,482.0, But we can we can get some mileage out of that render though.
482.0,483.0, That thing's not going away.
483.0,484.0, Yeah.
484.0,485.0, Yeah.
485.0,486.0, It's a magnificent render.
486.0,490.0," So right before we came downstairs, we just happened to look at this one."
490.0,496.0," Oh, I had those big, he's big gigantic beautiful poster size."
496.0,499.0, Gold covers old covers of CGW.
499.0,504.0, And we and I found one that just happened to be maybe the most controversial one of your.
504.0,505.0, era.
505.0,507.0, Maybe this can just be the last nostalgia thing before.
507.0,510.0," Why, which was the starcraft one cover."
510.0,511.0, That's right.
511.0,515.0," And I see why do you say, well, what the Big Deal was, the Big controversy."
515.0,517.0," So I'd gone down to see the game, right?"
517.0,518.0, With cover story.
518.0,521.0," And when it came time to it was, it was an ordeal in itself to actually even get."
521.0,524.0, Agreement from the staff to see your staff actually put starcraft on the cover.
524.0,525.0, Right.
525.0,527.0, Was it that time?
527.0,528.0, It was.
528.0,529.0, Real time.
529.0,531.0," Shadji games weren't really consider that, you know, some people thought maybe they're a"
531.0,533.0," fad or they, you know, they weren't here to last."
533.0,537.96," to last, they weren't true strategy games because, you know, back in the day, we'd play"
537.96,542.0," some Warcraft 2 and, you know, sometimes we'd have editors making fun of us for playing a game"
542.0,544.4, that they thought was all click-based and not strategy-based.
544.4,551.0," So anyway, finally we did get Starcraft on the cover and it came time to write the headline"
551.0,555.4, for the cover and I wanted to call it Best Strategy Game Ever.
555.4,558.24, I just unequivocally Starcraft is awesome.
558.24,559.24, This game is great.
559.24,560.24, It's going to be great.
560.24,561.24, I just want to call it the Best Strategy Game Ever.
561.24,564.24," Okay, you were down there and you came back utterly good."
564.24,567.5600000000001," Oh, for that game, you were just like, you guys aren't going to believe how fucking awesome"
567.5600000000001,568.5600000000001, this thing is.
568.5600000000001,569.5600000000001, Yeah.
569.5600000000001,573.96," But I think, you know, Johnny, a couple other people on staff said, no way."
573.96,577.6," There's no way and they're like, how can this game be better than civilization or"
577.6,579.0, mu or all these other games?
579.0,581.76," I don't know, like, I think it's the Best Strategy Game Ever."
581.76,583.16, But it's good to be the Best Strategy Game Ever.
583.16,584.16," No, I can't."
584.16,588.16," And then they qualified and said, okay, Best Real Time Strategy Game Ever."
588.16,591.36," And then, which was kind of a joke at the time because there hadn't been many yet."
591.36,595.7199999999999," There was like, yeah, it's a doon, you know, warcraft two and, you know, command a conqueror and"
595.7199999999999,597.1999999999999, then now there's going to be Starcraft.
597.1999999999999,600.4399999999999," You know, but, um, and then I thought, okay, that'd be fine."
600.4399999999999,604.3199999999999," But then, for some reason, then they quibbled over the ever, you know, at the end of"
604.3199999999999,607.48," the sentence, Best Real Time Strategy Game Ever."
607.48,610.92," And they thought, well, no, it can't be, you know, like, let's give us some time."
610.92,613.56," Maybe after a while, people will start thinking, this is a really great strategy."
613.56,617.0799999999999," So we'll just say, yet, you know, because remember, there hadn't been many real time"
617.08,618.08, strategy games.
618.08,621.36," Yeah, so, you know, at the end of the day, we're like, okay, fine, you know, our victory"
621.36,623.84, wasn't getting the game on the cover itself.
623.84,624.84, Right.
624.84,628.4000000000001," And so now that issue, best real time strategy game yet."
628.4000000000001,632.0," And I think, if you reflect on it now, I bet you, you won't get many arguments from"
632.0,635.32," people that would proclaim that as, you know, right, strategy game ever."
635.32,637.0400000000001, You probably could have said your original line.
637.0400000000001,638.0400000000001, Yeah.
638.0400000000001,639.0400000000001, And that would hold up.
639.0400000000001,640.0400000000001, Yeah.
640.0400000000001,643.44," How far along was the game when you saw that you were like, able to declare that already?"
643.44,645.6," Oh, I'm posted about my asshole."
645.6,646.6, It's on.
647.6,651.24," But on that particular one, you know, which, which I felt was was very true."
651.24,657.0400000000001," It was, you know, I'd had the designers walking me through, you know, saw the protests"
657.0400000000001,661.36," and how they play, saw the Zerg and the Creep, saw the Terrons and, you know, the moving"
661.36,664.12," around of the, you know, how they were nomadic."
664.12,665.36, You could move around the buildings and all that.
665.36,670.4," Saw a lot of the interdependencies between the units and, you know, the rock paper, even"
670.4,674.12," to call it rock paper scissors would be a disservice to the game balance in that game, actually."
674.12,678.2," It was just all that was already in there to see and, and, and recognize."
678.2,681.5600000000001," So I mean, there was a lot of great thought that went to that game and it was a really"
681.5600000000001,685.36," strategic game in addition to being just very fast-paced and, and, and very fun."
685.36,686.84, So you just clear to see early.
686.84,690.2, Should have arrived at the question mark best strategy game.
690.2,691.2, Ever?
691.2,692.2," Yeah, that would have worked."
692.2,693.2, Yeah.
693.2,696.16, It was a weird time at the staff because it was very kind of like there were like two
696.16,698.28, schools of thought.
698.28,702.92," There really hasn't been that kind of, I want to call it generational divide."
702.92,707.68," It wasn't by age, but there was definitely kind of like an old school and new school,"
707.68,708.68," yes, a staff."
708.68,714.5999999999999," You know, there was the group that had been with CGW longer who were very much in the old"
714.5999999999999,717.16, turn-based is where it's at.
717.16,721.92," They weren't, you know, action games were not something you really did on the PC, flight"
721.92,723.1999999999999, Sims war games.
723.1999999999999,724.1999999999999, Yep.
724.1999999999999,728.0," And, you know, I guess it was around the time you started around 95 when the shift started"
728.0,729.8, happening towards FPS is enough.
729.8,730.8," Yeah, Duke, Newcome 3D."
730.8,731.8, Right.
731.8,737.8," You know, and CGW in those dates was slow to kind of adopt that as something we're"
737.8,742.16," writing about, yes or no."
742.16,745.24," But, but that was a one time ago was fun."
745.24,746.24, As long time ago.
746.24,748.24," Anyway, that was then."
748.24,751.3199999999999," Thank you for reminishing with me, yeah, you."
751.3199999999999,752.3199999999999, We could do this all day.
752.3199999999999,753.3199999999999," Yeah, we could."
753.3199999999999,754.3199999999999, We'll have to have our own podcast.
754.3199999999999,755.3199999999999, There we go.
755.3199999999999,756.3199999999999, Keep going.
756.3199999999999,757.3199999999999, Not a good.
757.3199999999999,758.3199999999999, Yeah.
758.3199999999999,759.3199999999999, Yeah.
759.3199999999999,760.3199999999999, More.
760.3199999999999,761.3199999999999, I'll tell one more.
761.36,762.32, There you go.
762.32,763.32, He can't stay very long.
763.32,764.32, Okay.
764.32,765.32, That's true.
765.32,766.32, That's right.
766.32,767.32, We got in the back.
767.32,768.32, We talked about things after that.
768.32,772.84," Well, I just remember the one day of actually getting, I guess probably in the whole 10 years"
772.84,777.24," I've been here, of actually getting yelled at like being in school or having like a mean"
777.24,778.88, boss who bus you.
778.88,784.7600000000001, And that was because I was fucking around with you when we were on deadline.
784.7600000000001,787.9200000000001," Like we actually, you and I both had articles to write and we were late."
787.9200000000001,788.9200000000001, Yeah.
788.92,789.92, That was not really unusual.
789.92,790.92, And something's never changed.
790.92,791.92, How long with them?
791.92,794.04, The only difference that was I was not in charge.
794.04,795.04, Yeah.
795.04,796.9799999999999, I actually was held accountable.
796.9799999999999,800.0799999999999, And you and I were both seeing it our cubes.
800.0799999999999,801.5999999999999, You were at cubes next to each other.
801.5999999999999,803.88, And we were playing here as a might magic multiplayer.
803.88,804.88, Yeah.
804.88,805.88, And this is a turn-based game.
805.88,809.52," So you would make, you would move all your shit and then click and turn in the other"
809.52,810.52, guy would go.
810.52,815.92," So, you know, the other guy would be all tapped out doing work or pretending to work."
815.92,816.92, And then over the Q.Y.
816.92,817.92," We'd go, okay."
817.92,818.92," You know, your turn or whatever."
818.92,820.92, That's some kind of thing.
820.92,821.92, And then you'd all tap back.
821.92,822.92, Yeah.
822.92,823.92, And you can like a secret code.
823.92,824.92, Yeah.
824.92,825.92, But we're gonna turn it back.
825.92,832.1999999999999," So, you know, it was like a contentious, it was just one of those weeks where it was like"
832.1999999999999,836.8399999999999, stressful or maybe it was just that day where shit had to get done.
836.8399999999999,838.4399999999999, And yet we were fucking around anyway.
838.4399999999999,841.4399999999999," Oh, but we're doing work half the time."
841.4399999999999,842.4399999999999, We were doing our time.
842.4399999999999,843.4399999999999, We're doing our time half the time.
843.4399999999999,844.4399999999999, We're just trying.
844.4399999999999,845.4399999999999, Yeah.
845.4399999999999,846.4399999999999," But we couldn't, we couldn't just not play again."
846.44,848.2800000000001, That's all we did.
848.2800000000001,851.8800000000001," And Ken was making the rounds, you know, kind of like a teacher walking around the classroom,"
851.8800000000001,854.6," you know, checking up on people."
854.6,861.5600000000001," And I, like, totally, you know, I heard him coming, but I didn't quite all tab fast enough."
861.5600000000001,863.2, And he leapt on me.
863.2,867.36," It was like, got him like a fucking, like, you know, I don't know, like old movie with like"
867.36,868.84, a British school master or something.
868.84,870.7600000000001," He was just like, you are busted."
870.7600000000001,873.6400000000001, And he just yelled it and pointed right in my face.
873.64,876.24," I felt so, so bad."
876.24,879.08, Did you have to have an office talk with him about it?
879.08,881.1999999999999," It was just, no, he was just, he did yell."
881.1999999999999,883.6," He was just like, turn that shit off."
883.6,886.92," You know, right now, do your fucking articles."
886.92,889.16," I mean, he was, he was no, now he's a great guy."
889.16,890.56, And we had a comment.
890.56,891.56, Yeah.
891.56,892.56, It was like fuck.
892.56,894.56, Do you leave it on though?
894.56,897.24, Do you just minimize it or you actually shut it off?
897.24,898.72, I don't think we would have shut it off.
898.72,899.72, We probably didn't.
899.72,900.72, I'm sure we left it on.
900.72,901.96, It wouldn't have been in character.
901.96,903.36, We don't can leave.
903.36,904.36, Yeah.
904.36,905.96, And then all tab.
905.96,906.96, Yeah.
906.96,911.08," Those, and those Quake days that we brought it before, like I always thought bad."
911.08,912.84, Like we would be driving home.
912.84,915.2," Some days it's like, all we did if we'd be like, oh man."
915.2,916.2, I know.
916.2,919.88," I didn't do six hours of Quake and then two hours of, you know, editing."
919.88,920.88," Yeah, whatever."
920.88,922.2, Do you just feel guilty?
922.2,923.2, Yeah.
923.2,924.2, I was fun though.
924.2,925.88," I didn't earn my money, do you?"
925.88,929.28," When you were hiring, managing editor to yourself, was that like in the back of your head"
929.28,931.44," of criteria, so he's just gankin' a yell at me."
931.44,932.44, Yeah.
932.44,933.44, I've seen like the yelling.
933.44,934.44, Yeah.
934.44,936.2800000000001, A canless canless great.
936.2800000000001,937.2800000000001, He really was.
937.2800000000001,938.2800000000001," No, he wasn't."
938.2800000000001,943.2," And at the funny thing about, you know, Ken was also a, he was always able to sort of walk"
943.2,948.08," that fine line between, you know, understanding the old guard and understanding the new, the"
948.08,949.08," new kids, you know."
949.08,950.08, That's true.
950.08,954.2," And I should say, you know, about Johnny Wilson, that even though he was, you know,"
954.2,958.4000000000001," he was the king and, you know, very much old school."
958.4,963.88," He, right up till the time he left, was always incredibly open-minded about games."
963.88,966.64, Like he often didn't get enough credit for that.
966.64,967.64, Yeah.
967.64,970.1999999999999," You know, there were guys on the staff who were actually more conservative than him."
970.1999999999999,971.1999999999999, Yeah.
971.1999999999999,974.04," And do you remember, you were on staff when we had the game of the year vote for Diablo?"
974.04,975.04, Yeah.
975.04,976.04, Yeah.
976.04,977.04, Yeah.
977.04,979.68," Because at that time, you know, the old, the new school, there was such a, there was"
979.68,981.24, such a war between these two things.
981.24,986.0," That when the game of the year vote came, there was almost like, it was almost like, you"
986.0,988.28," know, a presidential election, political context."
988.28,992.0," You know, factions wanting like everybody's got to vote for that, like, you know,"
992.0,993.92, because this was the year of Quake.
993.92,994.92, Was it?
994.92,995.92, Yeah.
995.92,996.92, Quake.
996.92,997.92, I'm going to blow that.
997.92,1003.1999999999999," But I just remember, we are going around scheming for votes because we didn't want whatever"
1003.1999999999999,1005.0799999999999, civilization to might have come out that year.
1005.0799999999999,1007.76, It was either sift or or it was Alfa Centauri.
1007.76,1011.68, Maybe there was some turn-based old school turn-based strategy game that
1011.68,1015.16, Elie and I were determined was not going to win.
1015.16,1016.6, And so we are going around the office.
1016.6,1021.4," Like, you got to vote, you know, if you like this or this, just vote for Diablo for"
1021.4,1022.4, Diablo.
1022.4,1023.4, Yeah.
1023.4,1025.8, Even if it's your second choice because we don't want this other game to win.
1025.8,1028.88, Because CDW will look too fucking old if we do that.
1028.88,1030.4, So don't vote for that.
1030.4,1036.04," It's like, and in the end, when the votes were counted because we did a secret ballot,"
1036.04,1038.6, and Diablo was the overwhelming winner.
1038.6,1041.6," Like we were totally surprised, even though we were lobbying for votes."
1041.6,1042.6, Yeah.
1042.6,1045.96," The vote was so out, it was so lap-sided that we had no clue."
1045.96,1048.96," And, you know, Elie and I had written down before, you know, well, we know Johnny's"
1048.96,1049.96, going to vote for Alfa Centauri.
1049.96,1052.96," We know that TC's going to vote for, oh, whatever game it was."
1052.96,1053.96, Yeah.
1053.96,1057.08, And it turned out that Johnny had voted for Diablo.
1057.08,1058.32, And that totally surprised us.
1058.32,1063.24," And that was one of the things that made me realize, you know, he was always going to"
1063.24,1067.1200000000001," be kind of forward thinking, no matter whatever reputation he had."
1067.1200000000001,1068.1200000000001, Yeah.
1068.1200000000001,1069.1200000000001, That's true.
1069.1200000000001,1070.1200000000001, Yep.
1070.1200000000001,1074.1200000000001, Those are fun times.
1074.12,1077.76," And so, you know, when you were, there's some, it sounds also like, I mean, imagine"
1077.76,1081.12," people that were working at Rolling Stone at the time when, you know, hip-hop was just"
1081.12,1084.1999999999998, starting to blow up whether or not the magazine should cover that.
1084.1999999999998,1087.9199999999998," And then, to a different extent, even now, there's like this thing that I run into when"
1087.9199999999998,1091.8799999999999," I talk to a lot of the younger people here, and they're like way into shooters."
1091.8799999999999,1096.6," And it's like, we just have to agree to disagree that like, these are meant to be played"
1096.6,1097.6," with the mouse, depending on the line."
1097.6,1099.2399999999998," I mean, I always have to say that."
1099.2399999999998,1102.54," But for the, you know, and then I just like, I'll just watch a video of like, quite"
1102.54,1105.82," free tournament player or something, and I look at that and like, how can, how can any"
1105.82,1109.82," gamer look at this and not say, you know what?"
1109.82,1110.82, It's right.
1110.82,1111.82, Yeah.
1111.82,1114.7," You can't do this with the controller, you know, and it's like, part of it's just"
1114.7,1118.86," experience, you know, I mean, I just feel like, you know, you want it, when you play"
1118.86,1122.54," that kind of game, you're in the competitive mood, you want to be the best that you possibly"
1122.54,1123.54, can.
1123.54,1125.1," And I always feel like, this is a handicap."
1125.1,1132.22," This is a crutch, and I can't, and it's like, entirely impeding my ability to do what I want."
1132.22,1134.22, That's another could be a generational thing.
1134.22,1135.22, Yeah.
1135.22,1136.22, That is funny though.
1136.22,1138.82, They're going to be kids that grow up now that will never have known a shooter with
1138.82,1139.82, the mouse.
1139.82,1141.22," It's just going to be like, yeah, that's it."
1141.22,1145.3," We'll like, they're starting with Halo, cyclical thing, and it'll be like reintroduced"
1145.3,1148.22," as a gaming device, and it will like catch on again and keep away."
1148.22,1151.82," Oh my god, have you tried this new interface?"
1151.82,1157.7," I actually remember when you taught us, Elliot, James one who taught us how to circle"
1157.7,1160.34, strafe because that was the only lesson.
1160.34,1161.7, Because it was new at the time.
1161.7,1163.7, All we have was the keyboard.
1163.7,1165.7, Remember in the old days for two.
1165.7,1166.7, Yeah.
1166.7,1168.7," So I'm using the WASD and arrow keys, right?"
1168.7,1169.7, Yeah.
1169.7,1172.98," But you like, I mean, that's like, when you went to the arcade and played battle zone,"
1172.98,1174.7, did someone have to teach you how to do it?
1174.7,1176.7," No, we had to keep your hat."
1176.7,1180.7, I just remember sitting there was almost like a clapping class or something.
1180.7,1184.98," Like me, Dave Salvatore, Ken Brown, Johnny Wilson, I'll sit in there and please, James"
1184.98,1189.7," gone, no, you got to hit the arrow key here and turn the mouse."
1189.7,1191.7, So you can hear your target in view.
1191.7,1193.7," Is this right, Mr. Chan?"
1193.7,1195.7," Wow, I can run with the shit."
1195.7,1197.7, Yeah.
1197.7,1200.7," Yeah, because he used to just fucking kill us."
1200.7,1205.7," Despite what everyone else, Dave and Joe and all of us guys would say,"
1205.7,1209.7," yeah, you're not that much better, but yeah."
1209.7,1212.7," Yeah, you actually were one of the great trash talkers."
1212.7,1216.7," You know, you probably weren't kidding now."
1216.7,1221.7," Maybe you were serious, I don't know, but you were kind of like, you were kind of a prick a lot of"
1221.7,1222.7, a dad.
1222.7,1224.7," You were just like, oh, be chill."
1224.7,1225.7," Yeah, you guys are so excited."
1225.7,1229.7," And I would laugh because I knew I sucked it didn't matter, but guys like Dave was a"
1229.7,1230.7," Dave again, so mad."
1230.7,1233.7," No, but I'd say it was straight face, but yeah, no, I totally meant it."
1233.7,1237.7," But Dave would be like, he would be so his face would be red and, you know."
1237.7,1238.7, Yeah.
1238.7,1239.7, And then he would just destroy.
1239.7,1242.7," Yeah, but then on the one occasion when maybe they'd win, so we'd play it"
1242.7,1244.7," maybe like 10 matches, they wouldn't want out of 10."
1244.7,1248.7," And like they would be dancing and hollering and, you know, it's so excited about that one"
1248.7,1249.7, victory.
1249.7,1250.7, Yeah.
1250.7,1251.7, That's bad.
1251.7,1255.7, That happens to like when they play people from our friends list on steam and stuff.
1255.7,1258.7," And then, you know, people from the message boards and if you're playing death"
1258.7,1260.7," match, you know, get a single kill."
1260.7,1261.7, Let's start going crazy.
1261.7,1262.7, Yeah.
1262.7,1263.7, I killed you.
1263.7,1264.7, I killed the magazine.
1264.7,1267.7," We're playing no, seriously."
1267.7,1273.7," We're playing, you know, COD4 or something, team death match or straight free for all."
1273.7,1275.7," You know, for 20 minutes and say, okay, I died."
1275.7,1276.7, Holy shit.
1276.7,1277.7, Imagine that.
1277.7,1278.7, Yeah.
1278.7,1280.7, I'm gonna rest you for human to them.
1280.7,1281.7, Yeah.
1281.7,1284.7," And now I'm an old man like Jeff, so I can't play these games anymore."
1284.7,1288.7, I think we figured you are now as old as I was when I started.
1288.7,1289.7, That's correct.
1289.7,1290.7, Yep.
1290.7,1292.7, I'm not 35 and that's when Jeff started it.
1292.7,1293.7, It's still play.
1293.7,1294.7, Yeah.
1294.7,1295.7, You probably still got it.
1295.7,1296.7, You think.
1296.7,1298.7," Outside of the, I don't think it's the age at all."
1298.7,1301.7," I don't like, I don't feel like any, you know, like a bit of playing on COD4"
1301.7,1305.7," or COD4 servers and not the least bit threatened by players other than their,"
1305.7,1307.7, their commitment to it.
1307.7,1310.7, So the people that are putting in that are four to five hours a day.
1310.7,1311.7, Yeah.
1311.7,1317.7," And people on that level and that's just basically a mountain of, I mean, just practice, you know, like anyone who's going to do something at that level."
1317.7,1318.7, Yeah.
1318.7,1319.7, It's true.
1319.7,1320.7, It is.
1320.7,1321.7," Like, you know, we're kind of like writing a bike."
1321.7,1322.7, Yeah.
1322.7,1323.7, So do you still get a lot of time to play?
1323.7,1326.7," I mean, do are there games that you feel like you would be awesome at right now?"
1326.7,1327.7, No.
1327.7,1329.7," I mean, don't really have that much time to play."
1329.7,1332.7," I mean, I've been playing, you know, Call of Duty 4 awesome."
1332.7,1335.7, I actually loved last game I played that I loved was portal.
1335.7,1336.7, I love that.
1336.7,1338.7," You guys have all played that finish it, right?"
1338.7,1339.7, Yeah.
1339.7,1340.7, I'm sure a game of the year here.
1340.7,1341.7, Yeah.
1341.7,1343.7," The ending was, do I just love that ending?"
1343.7,1344.7, The 10th grade?
1344.7,1345.7, 17 hours.
1345.7,1346.7, Did.
1346.7,1347.7, Did.
1347.7,1348.7, Yeah.
1348.7,1349.7, You could look on my steam account.
1349.7,1350.7, 17 hours.
1350.7,1351.7, Yeah.
1351.7,1352.7, Nice.
1352.7,1354.7, I didn't know what to do about that.
1354.7,1355.7," Good going, Jeff."
1355.7,1357.7, He's not even surprised.
1358.7,1361.7," But I know, I'm playing Jeff knows this."
1361.7,1363.7," I just played, I mean, I love RTS."
1363.7,1364.7, Yeah.
1364.7,1365.7, I played a lot of that.
1365.7,1366.7," We played, you know, Warcraft 2 with the office."
1366.7,1367.7, Uh-huh.
1367.7,1369.7," You remember when a, and some of the studios came by and the first time they showed us"
1369.7,1370.7, HVMFARSA was a multiplayer game.
1370.7,1371.7, Yes.
1371.7,1373.7, In the lab and played multiplayer in that game was awesome.
1373.7,1374.7, Yeah.
1374.7,1375.7," That was the one actually, like a TC and Johnny."
1375.7,1376.7, They all got excited about that as well.
1376.7,1377.7, That's right.
1377.7,1378.7, HVMFARSA.
1378.7,1381.7, That was the first real time strategy game that the old school guys got into.
1381.7,1383.7, Because it had that same time they look.
1383.7,1386.7," It has been, you know, Bruce Shelley, you know, coming in to the show."
1386.7,1387.7, And they got excited about it.
1387.7,1388.7, Right.
1388.7,1390.7," That probably took them over the, you know, over the edge and throw them."
1390.7,1392.7," And so then embracing, you know, RTS."
1392.7,1395.7," There, there definitely, there was one moment where they really did."
1395.7,1396.7, Yeah.
1396.7,1397.7, Alley and I were playing.
1397.7,1400.7," Uh, I guess it was Warcraft 2 in the lab."
1400.7,1403.7, And they came over and were basically like pointing and laughing.
1403.7,1408.7," You know, because because we thought we were playing a strategy game and didn't know any better."
1408.7,1409.7, Yeah.
1409.7,1410.7, That was a theory.
1410.7,1411.7," But we did get, we did get them in play."
1411.7,1412.7, HVMFARSA.
1412.7,1413.7, We did play that.
1413.7,1415.7," And that was the one, one of the rare games."
1415.7,1420.7," We got the entire staff, you know, because in clay, you know, like the older staff didn't play that."
1420.7,1424.7," But at least with HVMFARSA, we even got, you know, the old, you know, old-timers to play that game."
1424.7,1425.7, That was when we had eight people.
1425.7,1427.7, We've had Charlotte played one game of HVMFARSA.
1427.7,1428.7, Yeah.
1428.7,1429.7, Yeah.
1429.7,1432.7, The editorial actually in those days the editor and chief actually had an assistant.
1432.7,1434.7, That's how big the staff was.
1434.7,1435.7, Yes.
1435.7,1436.7," And so, and we got her to play too."
1436.7,1437.7, Yeah.
1437.7,1438.7, Yeah.
1438.7,1441.7," That was the game where we were all, we all kept aging up."
1441.7,1447.7," And, you know, we're, you know, in the, whatever, and near the end game of HVMFARSA, like early on."
1447.7,1450.7, And the guy who was the strategy game editor at the time.
1450.7,1453.7," So, you know, the guy who ostensibly would be the best."
1453.7,1455.7, I don't know if he was supposed to our podcast.
1455.7,1456.7, I don't know if he does.
1456.7,1460.7," But I can run through his, his, his stone age caveman with my bronze cavalry,"
1460.7,1461.7, his shopster and his right.
1461.7,1463.7, The guy's still in the stone age.
1463.7,1464.7, Thank you.
1464.7,1466.7, How you get up there so fast.
1466.7,1467.7, What you doing?
1467.7,1468.7, I can't do it.
1469.7,1470.7, It's a strategy editor.
1470.7,1473.7," Did anyone ever use hacks internally, one of those matches?"
1473.7,1475.7, Just to piss up so and off.
1475.7,1477.7," No, we don't, I don't need hacks."
1477.7,1480.7," Well, I'm not saying you would be someone."
1480.7,1481.7," Maybe no, no, no, no, no, no."
1481.7,1482.7, I should talk in guy like this.
1482.7,1483.7, They got it.
1483.7,1484.7, They got it.
1484.7,1485.7," Samely, I read."
1485.7,1486.7," Yeah. No, I don't, I don't think anyone there."
1486.7,1487.7," I don't think we, no one ever resorted to teaching."
1487.7,1491.7," That was a, a much simpler time back in the 1800s when we used to,"
1491.7,1493.7, Dave just called everybody cheaters.
1493.7,1495.7, That's how with the fist of cuffs and all that.
1495.7,1497.7, I don't think we actually had cheating.
1497.7,1498.7," No, no, yes, we didn't know."
1498.7,1499.7, You were just claimed cheating.
1499.7,1500.7," Well, camping was cheating."
1500.7,1501.7, Camping was cheating.
1501.7,1502.7, Camping was cheating.
1502.7,1503.7, Sniping was genius.
1503.7,1504.7, Yeah.
1504.7,1505.7, Yeah.
1505.7,1507.7, Anything to do last was cheating.
1507.7,1508.7, Yeah.
1508.7,1510.7," Jovelina, he was cheating."
1510.7,1511.7, Rush was cheating.
1511.7,1512.7," Yeah, Rush was cheating."
1512.7,1513.7, Yeah.
1513.7,1514.7, Ruddling was cheating.
1514.7,1515.7," Turtle, I'm a cheating."
1515.7,1517.7, Danny Atkin was the classic turtle or yes.
1517.7,1518.7," Yeah, he's going to hold up and wait."
1518.7,1519.7, He was crazy.
1519.7,1523.7," He, he, he, in age of empires, he was a classic turtle or he would,"
1523.7,1526.7," he would build a city and then wallet in like,"
1526.7,1528.7," you know, walls in walls in walls."
1528.7,1529.7, It would be impossible.
1529.7,1530.7, And then he would build a wonder.
1530.7,1531.7, He would build a wonder.
1531.7,1535.7," And you know, a notice would come up because if you build a wonder, you win."
1535.7,1536.7, You win.
1536.7,1537.7, So you don't win instantly.
1537.7,1538.7, You don't win instantly.
1538.7,1539.7, It takes a lot of buildings.
1539.7,1542.7," But a notice would come up, you know, player Danny is building a wonder."
1542.7,1547.7," And so at that point, we all had, we were, and the meantime, the rest of us are all fighting all over the map."
1547.7,1551.7, And then that notice would come up when we would all be fuck everybody go on Danny.
1551.7,1552.7, Yeah.
1552.7,1553.7, And awesome.
1553.7,1554.7, He won because he was so freaking walled in.
1554.7,1555.7, Yeah.
1555.7,1557.7, And we never left his base.
1557.7,1559.7, He would play every multi-budder game.
1559.7,1560.7, He'd never leave.
1560.7,1562.7, His whole map must have been a fog of war.
1562.7,1563.7, Yeah.
1563.7,1564.7, Yeah.
1564.7,1566.7, That's what that's cheating.
1566.7,1567.7, That's what I like.
1567.7,1568.7, Game mechanic cheating.
1568.7,1570.7, That's what I like victory points.
1570.7,1571.7, Yep.
1571.7,1572.7, Yeah.
1572.7,1573.7, Yeah.
1573.7,1574.7, Yeah.
1574.7,1576.7, That have a adoption to turn off the wonder victory.
1576.7,1577.7, Yes.
1577.7,1578.7, You could.
1578.7,1579.7, But then what?
1579.7,1580.7, Then he wouldn't play with us.
1580.7,1581.7, Yeah.
1581.7,1582.7, Yeah.
1583.7,1585.7, We played the way that I will win that.
1585.7,1587.7," That's like when you want to have fun Dave,"
1587.7,1590.7," though, those, I had this like sort of weird."
1590.7,1595.7, The only game I ever actually had this weird like actual innate good talent for multiplayer
1595.7,1597.7, was interstate 76.
1597.7,1598.7, Yeah.
1598.7,1599.7, I like it.
1599.7,1600.7, I remember that.
1600.7,1601.7, Yeah.
1601.7,1602.7, I actually ended up being really good at that.
1602.7,1604.7, And I used to play Dave all the time in it.
1604.7,1605.7," Oh, he's so angry."
1605.7,1606.7, So angry.
1606.7,1607.7, Yeah.
1607.7,1610.7, Because he couldn't deal with the fact that I could be given something.
1610.7,1612.7," Because I was just like, you know,"
1612.7,1615.7, a little carpet for everybody in every game.
1615.7,1617.7, So he always knew he could get frags off Jeff.
1617.7,1619.7, So he and I would play interstate 76.
1619.7,1621.7, And I could totally kick his ass.
1621.7,1622.7, Yeah.
1622.7,1626.7, He got so fucking mad that he wanted to find another car game to beat me.
1626.7,1627.7, Yeah.
1627.7,1628.7, Because he couldn't beat me at that one.
1628.7,1630.7," Did he have like, did he like really try to justify and talk about how"
1630.7,1634.7," Scroby that game was and how it was impure that there was no,"
1634.7,1635.7," that it, that it, that it,"
1635.7,1636.7, a favorite chance.
1636.7,1638.7," Well, he would always, he would always have."
1639.7,1641.7," Dave, if you're listening, you know, I love you, man."
1641.7,1642.7," That's, that's good."
1642.7,1643.7, But we love to work with him.
1643.7,1644.7, We do.
1644.7,1645.7," It was really, it's a great guy."
1645.7,1648.7," But, you know, you're sportsmanship, Neil."
1648.7,1651.7," But, yeah, he would always fight."
1651.7,1654.7," There'd be some, some excuse why, you know,"
1654.7,1656.7," you know, you know, you know, say 76, you know,"
1656.7,1657.7, it wasn't fair or whatever.
1657.7,1659.7, I never won clean in anything.
1659.7,1660.7, But I would always beat him.
1660.7,1663.7," So anyway, he decided he had to beat me in another vehicle game"
1663.7,1664.7, because he couldn't beat me in that one.
1664.7,1667.7, So we decided we were going to play need for speed.
1667.7,1669.7, And he was going to beat me there.
1669.7,1671.7," I made me a were so on staff, I don't know."
1671.7,1673.7," But he would, I think I was, he would,"
1673.7,1675.7," basically all he did was memorize,"
1675.7,1677.7, he memorized one track.
1677.7,1679.7, Only.
1679.7,1683.7, And he got it to where he was perfect on that track.
1683.7,1686.7," And at this point, like I hadn't played it at all that much,"
1686.7,1688.7, but he would only play me on that track.
1688.7,1692.7," And I was like, dude, let's go to, let's have it all things be equal."
1692.7,1694.7, Let's go to a track where neither of us know it.
1694.7,1695.7, And he wouldn't do it.
1695.7,1696.7, He'd only play in the track where he could kick me.
1696.7,1697.7, I asked.
1697.7,1698.7, I got it.
1698.7,1699.7, All right.
1699.7,1701.7," You win again, Dave."
1701.7,1702.7, Good for you.
1702.7,1703.7, I'll play this thing.
1703.7,1704.7," Yeah, you won."
1704.7,1707.7," It's like, it's like, is that victory around the office?"
1707.7,1708.7, Yeah.
1708.7,1709.7, Yeah.
1709.7,1710.7, I got green.
1710.7,1712.7," It's like playing with your two-year-old,"
1712.7,1714.7," and I think I win in, you know, in checkers."
1714.7,1715.7," Yeah, you won."
1715.7,1716.7, I don't know.
1716.7,1717.7, I don't know.
1717.7,1718.7, Yeah.
1718.7,1719.7, I don't know.
1719.7,1720.7, I don't know.
1720.7,1721.7," Love you, Dave."
1721.7,1722.7, Yeah.
1722.7,1723.7, Uh.
1723.7,1725.7," Ellie, Chin, you need to go back to."
1725.7,1726.7, I need to go around.
1726.7,1728.7," My, my shiny Prius is going to get to."
1728.7,1730.7," Yeah, go make money for Sega."

1805.7,1807.7," And that's got, you know, it's a 360 in PS3,"
1807.7,1809.7, but also PC.
1809.7,1810.7, Wow.
1810.7,1811.7, Yeah.
1811.7,1812.7, What's the call to send school to me?
1812.7,1813.7," Oh, that's right."
1813.7,1814.7, That was the one that was on the G-I.
1814.7,1815.7, Cover of G-I.
1815.7,1816.7, Yeah.
1816.7,1817.7, Yeah.
1817.7,1818.7," I wanted to, you know, what?"
1818.7,1819.7, I wanted to read that story.
1819.7,1821.7," And the issue we got, it had a printing air."
1821.7,1822.7," Oh, that's right."
1822.7,1823.7, It did.
1823.7,1824.7, Yeah.
1824.7,1825.7, I was gone.
1825.7,1826.7, So I had to cover them.
1826.7,1827.7, Like this sounds cool.
1827.7,1828.7, I read like a synopsis online.
1828.7,1832.7," Like this actually sounds like a nice, you know, new approach to your fresh approach to RPG-making back."
1832.7,1833.7, Yeah.
1833.7,1834.7, Cool.
1834.7,1835.7, Pages weren't there.
1835.7,1836.7, Check it out.
1836.7,1837.7, We didn't.
1837.7,1838.7, Awesome.
1838.7,1839.7, Yeah.
1839.7,1840.7, All right.
1840.7,1841.7, So thank you.
1841.7,1842.7, So thanks for being here.
1842.7,1854.7, We're going to take a break and be your right back.
1854.7,1857.7," This, we're back."
1857.7,1860.7," Uh, you guys all done showing now?"
1860.7,1861.7, No.
1861.7,1862.7, You guys are eating them all.
1862.7,1865.7," It's like, Narlie looking shit I've ever seen."
1865.7,1867.7," It's like, they glow looking."
1867.7,1870.7, Sour tongue tinglers are called.
1870.7,1873.7, And I guess they're like gummy bears in the shape of pacifiers.
1873.7,1874.7, It's not gummy bears.
1874.7,1878.7," I thought they were sour patch kids, but the texture is way different."
1878.7,1880.7, It's a special request.
1880.7,1889.7," And we actually do want to thank the fellow who sent these into us as a kind of a, thank you."
1889.7,1891.7," Uh, do you have to be thank you?"
1891.7,1896.7," I'll be hugely thankful for them because I think they were supposed to go to me, but because they were addressed to you."
1896.7,1899.7," Uh, now it's like they're in everyone's care."
1899.7,1903.7," And I get to have a few, but I specifically mentioned somehow."
1903.7,1908.7," I don't know, like international candy came up on one of our threats because people, I don't know."
1908.7,1912.7," People are talking about like, I'm going over Tim Hortons and Canada."
1912.7,1914.7, Having their donuts and coffee.
1914.7,1919.7," So I mentioned, you know, I used to live at the Canadian border in Washington state."
1919.7,1921.7, How much I love their candy there.
1921.7,1925.7," And, you know, when Vancouver, um, it's kind of like the grass is greener thing because people they are like,"
1925.7,1928.7," oh, man, we're going to snickers or something."
1928.7,1930.7," And like, yeah, I'm just on board of that."
1930.7,1932.7, And they're these specifically sour passfires.
1932.7,1936.7," It's like the texture that Sean doesn't like is what I like that they're super kind of like a stale,"
1936.7,1937.7," uh, jujubey."
1937.7,1939.7, That was about to say it's got that jujubey.
1939.7,1941.7, But like it's a good idea for ever.
1941.7,1945.7," And sour in a way that like shame sour patch kids, which are also from Canada,"
1945.7,1948.7," but I think in the first place, um, and they're awesome."
1948.7,1950.7, And I mentioned it on a message board.
1950.7,1951.7, And here they are.
1951.7,1956.7," They were behold, they arrived not only that, but in a package that was wrapped up in the vampire,"
1956.7,1960.7, the infamous vampire cover of computer gaming world magazine.
1960.7,1961.7, Right.
1961.7,1962.7, So that was pretty awesome.
1962.7,1964.7," The nice guy who sent it to us is, uh,"
1964.7,1965.7, you just get into me.
1965.7,1968.7," Aaron Simmer from the, the website, the armchair empire."
1968.7,1972.7, And Aaron has done a bunch of interviews with me over the years.
1972.7,1974.7," I think starting from before I was, uh,"
1974.7,1975.7, I didn't know this.
1975.7,1980.7," Yeah, every year on his website, he would interview me until I think at one year I actually,"
1980.7,1985.7," um, stopped emailing him back just because I'm an ass."
1985.7,1989.7," He's got a, he must have a guy I'm sorry Aaron on the Neo gift."
1989.7,1990.7, He did it for him.
1990.7,1994.7," Because this is the, that's where I was like posting and talking."
1994.7,1995.7, Okay.
1995.7,1996.7, Reconnected.
1996.7,1997.7, So you need to connect the dots.
1997.7,1998.7, Yeah.
1998.7,1999.7, Let's hook up again.
1999.7,2000.7," It was all, it was all my fault."
2000.7,2001.7, It wasn't you.
2001.7,2003.7," Um, so thanks for the candy."
2003.7,2007.7, I used to live in Buffalo and we used to get certain select Canadian candies across the forest.
2007.7,2008.7, Not that one.
2008.7,2011.7," We used to get the smarties, um, which are the,"
2011.7,2014.7," in America's smarties are, you know, tart sugar things."
2014.7,2015.7," Oh, yeah."
2015.7,2016.7, Yeah.
2016.7,2017.7, They're Eminem.
2017.7,2018.7, Canadian Eminem.
2018.7,2019.7, Yeah.
2019.7,2020.7, Very strange.
2020.7,2021.7, That used to baffle me.
2021.7,2022.7, They got a cadbury flake.
2022.7,2024.7, I can't deal with the texture either.
2024.7,2025.7," I just can't, I can't do it."
2025.7,2027.7," I have a good, very jujuby of candidates."
2027.7,2028.7, I never liked it.
2028.7,2029.7," Well, I need to get it."
2029.7,2030.7, I need to go there.
2030.7,2033.7," Ryan, who didn't say much in the first half,"
2033.7,2035.7, mainly with was because he was chewing.
2035.7,2036.7, Yeah.
2037.7,2038.7, Yes.
2038.7,2039.7, That's good.
2039.7,2043.7, So thank you for the sour tongue tinglers.
2043.7,2047.7, So we got a few things are on our agenda today.
2047.7,2052.7," Uh, one of them, um, Sean, you made a pretty, um,"
2052.7,2057.7," lengthy post on the, on the blogs this week about the reaction to,"
2057.7,2062.7," to, uh, and guy curls, uh, post about."
2063.7,2068.7," The resident evil five, uh, trailer and the, um, uh,"
2068.7,2076.7, what he believed was racist imagery in that trailer and you made your own comments about that and the reaction to his comments.
2076.7,2078.7," And, uh,"
2078.7,2079.7," I was just going to,"
2079.7,2081.7, and there's that.
2081.7,2082.7, And there's that.
2082.7,2084.7, And it's been going on since each last year.
2084.7,2087.7," What came back up because there's, you know, another trailer was issued."
2088.7,2093.7," Um, and so the story that we're talking about appeared on MTV's multiplayer, uh,"
2093.7,2095.7," I think that's another, you know, online blog."
2095.7,2096.7, Yeah.
2096.7,2097.7, Yeah.
2097.7,2099.7," And guys, for alls, uh, newsweek, level up blogger."
2099.7,2103.7," And basically it was an interview with him and, and someone at the MTV site, um,"
2103.7,2108.7," just about the trailer and they've been having this discussion about, you know, uh,"
2108.7,2110.7," just, I think, race and games in general and then out of it,"
2110.7,2112.7," they decided that this would, you know,"
2112.7,2115.7," Meredith and, you know, wisely decided that this would merit its own story."
2115.7,2119.7," And because it was, it's sort of kicked off like just this huge."
2119.7,2121.7," I would like to say debate, but I don't know."
2121.7,2125.7," It's, it's gotten a lot of attention and a lot of reaction online."
2125.7,2128.7," What crawl, um, you know, hopefully I'm, I'm getting this right."
2128.7,2129.7," He, um,"
2129.7,2131.7," He took issue with, and again,"
2131.7,2134.7, this is specifically about imagery in the trailer.
2134.7,2139.7," This is not, this is not saying that the game is racist or that the game is,"
2139.7,2143.7," you know, going to be, but that there's specific that there's imagery that has,"
2143.7,2149.7," you know, by potentially racist baggage as it's presented in this one single trailer."
2149.7,2154.7," And so the reason I say a lot of reaction, not necessarily debate is because a lot of times,"
2154.7,2156.7," I mean, I like to think that, you know,"
2156.7,2159.7," that the age of all these new, you know, new video technologies, uh,"
2159.7,2163.7," where you have text messaging and the ability to blog, um,"
2163.7,2167.7, and all these new forms for people to communicate in.
2168.7,2172.7," It lacks a certain something in just old fashion conversation, you know,"
2172.7,2174.7," where you used to this, you're not just the people are dex,"
2174.7,2180.7, but sometimes there's just a total disconnect between commentary and response.
2180.7,2184.7," So that, you know, for example, if, uh,"
2184.7,2186.7," if you post, you know, like in my blog,"
2186.7,2189.7," one thing I wanted to point out was that, you know,"
2189.7,2191.7," for, for everyone that says, well,"
2191.7,2195.7," if it's simply the fact that there are black zombies in this game that's a fend,"
2195.7,2198.7," that's a fending this guy, you know, he's got to be a whos,"
2198.7,2202.7," because we've blown the shit out of Spanish zombies in a reasonable four,"
2202.7,2205.7," and in, you know, white Chinese and black or whatever,"
2205.7,2207.7," like people of all, you know,"
2207.7,2209.7," nationalities and ethnicities,"
2209.7,2212.7," rather than the same American nationality and, uh,"
2212.7,2214.7, previous resident evil games.
2214.7,2218.7," And so, you know, part of this, part of this blog that I made was to,"
2218.7,2222.7, to emphasize why there's a different context and how important that context is.
2222.7,2223.7," And I'll get to that in a second,"
2223.7,2227.7," that's like, so you take all the time to do this and then some of the first responses are like,"
2227.7,2231.7," well, yeah, but we already played games where you could shoot up Spanish and whites and"
2231.7,2233.7, risen evil. So what's the point?
2233.7,2235.7," It's like, wait a minute."
2235.7,2239.7," This blog was a reaction to that reaction,"
2239.7,2240.7, and then here we come again.
2240.7,2241.7, Full start.
2241.7,2242.7, Yeah.
2242.7,2245.7," So, I mean, that's a whole other thing altogether."
2245.7,2249.7," But what, what is getting at is that it's in the same way,"
2249.7,2252.7," one example, I'll use a different example than the one I used in my blog."
2252.7,2256.7," Say, if you just have, um, like,"
2256.7,2261.7," like, if there was a Japanese made game right now or, and it was basically set in China,"
2261.7,2262.7," it doesn't matter what, what period."
2262.7,2263.7, It could be the 40s.
2263.7,2264.7, It could be now.
2264.7,2266.7," It could be the 30s, it could be the 30s."
2266.7,2267.7, It could be the 30s.
2267.7,2268.7, It could be the 30s.
2268.7,2269.7, It could be the 30s.
2269.7,2270.7, It could be the 30s.
2270.7,2271.7, It could be the 30s.
2271.7,2274.7," And it's basically involves, you know, a Japanese guy and he's doing nothing,"
2274.7,2276.7, but shooting up a bunch of Chinese zombies the whole time.
2276.7,2278.7, That is different.
2278.7,2280.7, And that context does matter.
2281.7,2285.7," But Japanese guy in, you know, when in a Danish village or something,"
2285.7,2287.7, with a bunch of Danish zombies.
2287.7,2289.7," And that of course is because the history of, you know,"
2289.7,2292.7," of Japanese invasion of a Mediterranean, a Mediterranean,"
2292.7,2294.7, and then the rest of China.
2294.7,2301.7," And so again, because there's this notion of, I mean,"
2301.7,2305.7," just an angry black mob, and this comes up all over, you know,"
2305.7,2308.7," I mean, this is where we're used to it in headlines,"
2308.7,2312.7," and we're currently with Darfur, the recent past with what happened in Rwanda."
2312.7,2318.7," The imagery of it is associated all the way back with Antibelma America,"
2318.7,2322.7," just a fear of slaveholders of slave up, rise in some stuff."
2322.7,2326.7," It's come again in, you know, in popular imagery through the Watts writes through"
2326.7,2329.7," the civil rights, you know, after Martin Luther King was assassinated."
2329.7,2333.7," Everything from, you know, Katrina and stuff."
2333.7,2335.7," I mean, these, these fears and these general, you know,"
2335.7,2339.7," just scenes where you have a bunch of black people right there,"
2339.7,2342.7," the Rodney King, running, running, running right."
2342.7,2345.7," Right. And because of that fear and that imagery,"
2345.7,2348.7," even if people aren't able to specifically pinpoint all these things,"
2348.7,2351.7," you know, another one would be, you know, battle mogul issue, right."
2351.7,2354.7, People are familiar with blackhawk down.
2354.7,2355.7, Yeah.
2355.7,2357.7, So that's there.
2357.7,2359.7," And I think when part of, you know, when they're making this game,"
2359.7,2363.7," they know that, you know, the developers capcom know that if we have this imagery,"
2363.7,2369.7, it's not going to be just the same as here's just a change of scenery that this is going to be
2369.7,2373.7," evocative and, you know, it's, and it's going to, you know,"
2373.7,2376.7, like move people and it's going to fascinate some people.
2376.7,2377.7, It's going to scare other people and stuff.
2377.7,2382.7," But part of that is because of all this history that it's cultural baggage, right."
2382.7,2384.7, And they're drawing on that.
2384.7,2387.7," And so part of the point I was making is that, I mean, this could be okay."
2387.7,2389.7," The other thing, the main thing about this is that I don't,"
2389.7,2391.7," neither I nor end guy. I mean, we have different, you know,"
2391.7,2393.7," we're trying to try to outline where, you know,"
2393.7,2397.7, our perspective on it my differ a little bit in my blog and.
2397.7,2402.7," But I don't think anyone here was saying, oh my God, this is an outrage."
2402.7,2403.7, No one was outraged right.
2403.7,2404.7, Right. Right. Right. Right.
2404.7,2409.7, And I think a lot of the responses kind of assume that that if you're bringing up
2409.7,2412.7," race that you must be just out, you do must be downright independent."
2412.7,2416.7," I mean, you, it's like, you are ready to go to war over this."
2416.7,2419.7," And instead, it's more of just a really, you know,"
2419.7,2423.7," you know, hopefully just a measured and thoughtful response to, hey, you know, looking at this."
2423.7,2426.7, Here's some of the things that are interesting about this.
2426.7,2436.7," A big part of the reaction, I mean, I'll let you guys jump in, but it seems to be that the people are so used to looking at games is nothing but a scapeysm."
2436.7,2438.7, And purely a scapeysm.
2438.7,2444.7," And they can't see how something could be both a scapeysm, but can also have implicit messages."
2444.7,2453.7," And it can also be worth discussing in a way other than what happened when you press this button and whether or not you were compelled, which is for us that button."
2453.7,2459.7," And for us, I think, whatever our backgrounds, you know, mind and then guys, I mean, we're very used to this thing."
2459.7,2464.7," You know, you can watch, you know, like Toy Story or something at the same time, you're like, doesn't that look cool?"
2464.7,2468.7," You see, like, you know, they're a flushing on the space management helmet and you're like, oh, this is also interesting."
2468.7,2473.7, You have something to do with cowboys being this hero for boys and stuff.
2473.7,2475.7, And then it's moving on to astronauts.
2475.7,2476.7, And there's some stuff going on there.
2476.7,2485.7," It's not just that there's, and because if you're, if you're just stepping in and make some comment about, hey, pay a little bit of attention to the specificity of these toys and the roles are playing in this movie."
2485.7,2487.7, Doesn't mean you're not having fun with it.
2487.7,2488.7, Doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.
2488.7,2490.7," And that's, and that's the same to bat thing."
2490.7,2494.7, But I think a lot of the audience online is just not used to that in the least bit.
2494.7,2499.7," So they get really defensive and they're also, you know, rightly so, rightly used to becoming defensive about games because they're attacked."
2499.7,2512.7," And such ridiculous and the greatest ways on, you know, on the news networks and right party you kind of want to say, like, hey, don't don't give them fuel for the fire, you know, don't criticize it for racism because then you're going to get the,"
2512.7,2513.7, You're going to get those people to build up.
2513.7,2519.7," Yeah, the Yahoo's, bro, that's just, you know, suppresses and rational conversations, right."
2519.7,2530.7," I mean, which is, problem with discussing anything like racism or sexism or, you know, homophobia on the internet is it's so tight in with people's identities and on the internet."
2530.7,2532.7, It's so easy to not have an identity.
2532.7,2538.7," So you can't even, you don't know anything about the person who's responding to your responses, right?"
2538.7,2544.7," You can't, you can't, you know, assume anything about them, you can't, you have no idea what their perspective is, what their background is."
2544.7,2556.7," And then it's an off-road important. Yeah, I mean, the shared assumptions that you can have when you, when you have a conversation with someone, I mean, it's, well, Jeff and I, everyone in this room, we know each other well enough, but like say, we're just the first time I'm at an end guy."
2556.7,2565.7," Maybe after about talking with them about whatever it may be for about 10 minutes, I'm already to the point where I'm assuming certain things about him about his education about his familiarity."
2565.7,2571.7, If I could talk about this and I won't have to preface it with like a base level introduction to the concepts that I'm about to allude to.
2571.7,2582.7," And people work with this way in a face-to-face conversation all the time, but then when you take that away then you start jumping in you're like, wait, maybe I have to back this up because maybe some people aren't even aware."
2582.7,2600.7," Somehow an American history that there, that among the various types, you know, I make sure to underscore that these are revolting and the various types of minstrels and symbols and all these things that there is this notion of the savage, you know, and this is angry, just violent force that's sort of just there beneath civilized society."
2600.7,2603.7, Waiting to come out and just tear everything to shit.
2603.7,2609.7," And some people that are not aware of this, I mean, maybe they're born in the 1980s and they have no understanding."
2609.7,2618.7," I mean, even though if they're born in the 80s in their lifetime, plenty of shit's happened to let them see that this is actually a type, you know, a stereotype."
2618.7,2624.7," But I mean, if you have a longer reach just by, you know, doing, you know, if you have some education will help you out and stuff."
2624.7,2639.7," But like you, you go online, you make these comments, you can't assume that everyone has got that background. So you got to back it up, wait a minute, do a fun and have this conversation, do I have to start with that with the detailed breakdown of some of these things that we're going to then alluded to in this discussion there and form it."
2639.7,2640.7, That's pretty right.
2640.7,2647.7," I think it was end guy who said it and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was a point he made or might it might have been you, I forgot, but."
2647.7,2662.7," But that helped me understand why, because I definitely felt that way, I definitely felt way back when I saw the first one, you know, before it started becoming a meme or whatever, like that was my gut reaction like, whoa, that's some kind of messed up imagery."
2662.7,2676.7, And and the point I read this morning about it was that the village itself has this kind of ominous creepy dark overton to it without even the zombie part.
2676.7,2688.7," And that's drawing that very much that you don't see like kids playing or moms or whatever that and that that completely draws into this idea of like, you know, the scary savage village."
2688.7,2689.7, Right.
2689.7,2696.7," Before you get to the zombie, or you assume it is, you know, a third world country already have that assumption that that's where this is taking place."
2696.7,2705.7," Yeah, the people are in the shadows being, you know, you could say that the people at Capcom, you know, the Japanese developers of this game and they're clearly they're drawing on tropes that are used in the horror."
2705.7,2720.7," You know, films and you know, and horror storytelling. So it's like, you know, imagine if it was all whatever, everyone in the in the in the in the trailer was of the same color or something, you know, you would look at it differently, you know, but it's like there."
2720.7,2727.7," Even though that's kind of an excuse, it's like, yes, we, this is what all horror movies do again, it's like right."
2728.7,2745.7," I'm trying to, this is very difficult to talk about, but again, like, okay, the part part of what he was reacting to is he was calling the way that everyone is ominous and and other, you know, in sort of a grad school speak of of how how the people are before their zombies and they could have done something differently by, you know,"
2745.7,2752.7," say Chris Redfield, the character's walking through the town and instead of everyone is sort of just on these tracks and there's no interaction between anyone."
2752.7,2762.7," One of some kids are playing ball in the ball real tart Chris and he kicks it back to him and it's like, even something is simple as that would then say that there's some connection. These are all people."
2762.7,2768.7," Right. We can, we the game makers are assuming that these people are actually people and normal."
2768.7,2785.7," We don't, this we're looking at 30 seconds of it. And that's true. And we're just all we're talking about is right is is the reaction to this particular piece of film, which they separately chose to represent their game as like the first thing people see right."
2785.7,2796.7," Yes, so I mean that, you know, it's challenging because they don't want to show their hand and give away too much of the story and reassure you that like, oh, well, maybe this game is like 90% of the time you're playing, you know,"
2796.7,2809.7," this character, a black character who's like from the same area and he's working with all these other people and to and that they're all these rampifications of you know, whatever that whatever angle they end up taking with the zombie angle and the story and stuff."
2809.7,2814.7," I mean, all that could be there, but it's kind of like they could have done it for the trailer."
2814.7,2820.7," But here's another thing to point out, you know, when you first thought you were like, you were disturbed or something by I wasn't scared."
2820.7,2825.7," But it was like I was very aware of the fact that when I watched it, I had a different reaction to it."
2825.7,2832.7," Yeah, then I would when I looked at the trailers for a resident, he before and thinking about, well, why is it feel different?"
2832.7,2838.7," Do you feel a little bit like, I mean, do you feel uneasy about it? Do you feel, I mean, why is it have this extra impact?"
2838.7,2846.7," And I think that part of the things that we've been bringing up, that's part of the explanation is because you are on some level aware of the baggage attached to this imagery."
2847.7,2859.7," Right. Yeah. I mean, when I watched it, I was I was aware that like the distinction between racist and using race, like I says the key there is it was like, okay, this is clearly aware that"
2860.7,2871.7," Earlier, it should be that it is using race or imagery, but I wasn't necessarily taking the next step that this is like a horrible thing. I just was like, okay, that's very intriguing. I would like to know how they actually handled it in the mall."
2871.7,2872.7, Right.
2872.7,2880.7," Which maybe is the is what they were going for in a trailer. You know what I mean, like maybe they, maybe they just, you know, didn't go in the right way."
2880.7,2890.7, And my reaction was I hope there actually is some more to this and I want to actually play this because I've kind of been my buttons have been pushed that way.
2890.7,2893.7," And I'm, I'm my interest is peaked."
2893.7,2903.7," I absolutely agree. I think another element of is that people see it and they say, well, why do you want to like read all this politics into you?"
2903.7,2909.7," I mean, why should this game have to be concerned with explaining itself from a sociological perspective and you know, political point of view."
2909.7,2922.7," And the counterpoint that I would make is that the game is already contains, you know, this implicit sociological historical and cultural messages because of the decisions it's made."
2922.7,2933.7," And it's not like you have to say, well, we're going to make a game that's about, you know, this is kind of a lead into something we're going to talk about later and show you have to make a game that that's about issues. It's an issue game."
2933.7,2942.7," But stuff is is just in there. I mean, anything that's a cultural product is just by default going to have some investment in a value."
2942.7,2961.7," If you make the decision to set the game in a real world setting with real world people and you're going to add elements like race to the picture. You don't get a free pass. You know, if you're going to send it in, you know, magic fairy land, you know, pony world."
2962.7,2966.7," Then then okay, but once he start making those decisions."
2969.7,2972.7, Things have to get analyzed that way. There's no you don't get out of it.
2972.7,2974.7," Right. You know, I just."
2974.7,2984.7," And there's also the, again, going back to the weed. Don't know what this game is and what is trying to say if anything. Let's stress that we're hoping it says things we like."
2984.7,2994.7," But there's also the disconnect perhaps and maybe there isn't a disconnect here, but in the movie movie land. The people cutting the trailers are not the director of the movie with a writer of the movie."
2994.7,2998.7, Right. Some guy who has been tasked to make 30 seconds of enticing footage.
2998.7,3005.7," Right. And I'm usually someone completely separate from that. And I don't know. I think what game development it's probably someone in house, but it might not be."
3006.7,3018.7," You know, the person who's in charge of guy in the whole vision. So it might have, and I don't know for a fact that maybe the director of the game did cut this trailer, but maybe there's just two separate people working here."
3018.7,3024.7," And like the guy who over a cap, and I'm just like, you released that to represent my game."
3024.7,3028.7," And there might just be complete unawareness whatsoever. I mean, I think it doesn't."
3029.7,3034.7," Detracted off from end guys point though, just that the baggage is just there."
3034.7,3038.7, And you got to deal with the fact that it is there. You can't blow off the bag.
3038.7,3051.7," And you can, and if you don't, if you legitimately don't take any issue with it, you see it. It means nothing to you. It's no different than if it were any, you know, if they were purpose on bees or yellow or green or whatever."
3052.7,3058.7," Then maybe death's the case and you could make a case for yourself, but that doesn't mean that like end guys wrong."
3058.7,3068.7," Right. When given his experience, you know, and given his perspective, if he feels uneasy by it, but again, the key point is that he's never totally, he's not telling people the boy caught this game."
3068.7,3075.7," Based on the trailer, he's not, you know, trying to dissuade someone from buying it. Always trying to do is encourage people to think about how they're reacting to it."
3075.7,3080.7," And that shouldn't be threatening at all. I mean, why should it be threatening?"
3080.7,3084.7," And the response, that's what when some of us are so venomous, that seems weird."
3084.7,3091.7," I mean, if there's a lot of games to be perceived as art or whatever, and they think games can be art, then these are the exact kind of, you know,"
3091.7,3096.7," Right. Topics that art touches upon and draws upon and, you know, relax."
3096.7,3101.7," And even if you've done stuff that's not art, like if you have take a television commercial,"
3102.7,3117.7," The most crass television commercial, it might very well have a number. It might, might have a number of complicit, implicit meanings in the way that it's put together, that it's better still there, even though it's not trying to make any kind of message whatsoever."
3117.7,3122.7," Maybe it's just trying to sell a product, but I mean, if it's like blonde people are happier."
3122.7,3128.7," Yeah. I mean, and when you have enough things like this, you know, or, you know, trying to think if you,"
3129.7,3139.7," There's an example that I don't agree with, but I mean, there's been like controversy over, like say there's an advertisement, this is a specific one for Kentucky Fried Chicken, and it was like, it was just mom and the kids and some people were like,"
3139.7,3144.7," Well, this is just being representative of all large portion of the audience,"
3144.7,3155.7," and other people are like, well, no, it's not. It's saying it's a normative statement. It's not like descriptive statement, and there's all these things, but those are still there. I mean, everything, whether right or wrong, I mean, that's right."
3155.7,3158.7, That's why the conversation ensued is because people saw that.
3158.7,3159.7, Yes.
3159.7,3172.7," The other thing about this is like, if you have enough pop cultural points of, you know, reference where like blackhawk down and, and, you know, games like this come out, and then over time, what happens, I think,"
3172.7,3185.7," is younger people are just sort of used to seeing these, and they just become a convention or a job, and then after, wow, for some people, they just become divorced from the context of where, where did this imagery arise from in the first place?"
3185.7,3198.7," And then you kind of lose that, and for me, it's like, I mentioned the blog, it's like, well, you're borrowing, you're taking, you know, you're using the impact of this imagery to help make your game, you know, to lend the extra degree of, you know, impact to your game,"
3198.7,3203.7," and not acknowledging any of the baggage involved with it, and that was a bad thing, and some people were like, well, what?"
3203.7,3208.7," You think that, that resonated before, suppose to explain, Darford has nothing to do with it, and that's ridiculous, of course not."
3208.7,3218.7," But what in example of acknowledging it would be, like, in the case, I provide, it would be that if Redfield kicked the ball back at a kid, and it was just kind of like, hey, it's a kid playing ball, here's your ball kid."
3218.7,3226.7," Right. Like, that would be an example of acknowledging that like, okay, that these are people, it's not, and that there are all, that there are reasons, no matter, I mean, how bar bear,"
3226.7,3239.7," and brutal, the real scenarios are, or ones that are just largely just based on xenophobia, or just fear, and they're entirely unwanted, that in all of these circumstances, there's like more of a story than just, this, what these people do."
3239.7,3250.7," And you're talking about like, changing, like, say that image of Chris kicking the ball back was in there, like, one second of chosen footage could have changed the entire context of this thing, right?"
3250.7,3251.7, Right.
3251.7,3255.7," People that have seen different things in it. Yeah. And again, maybe it is there."
3255.7,3271.7," Look at this. I think maybe the meaning of the sense of, like, if you see, you know, you're looking straight, and you see, here is walking through the town, and everyone's kind of in the shadows, and everyone's doing their own thing, and looking at them, and when they show them, and the ominous music's playing, and this is part of the horror movie, you know,"
3271.7,3279.7," standard that we were talking about. So you take, what they'll do is like, you know, a hitch car or something, we'll take just a really normal scenario and make it ominous and frightening."
3279.7,3290.7," Sure. Then when you're doing it here, what ends up happening to this, you know, implicit message I keep referring to is that the people in the scene don't suddenly just go from being normal to becoming zombies."
3290.7,3294.7," It was like, there's a bunch of like zombies waiting to happen. Yeah. Yeah."
3294.7,3302.7, Now the truth cells are coming out. Now they've changed to the potential danger is now become the actual danger.
3302.7,3319.7," I had an interesting experience when I was sick, and my wife and kid would bring home movies, and at the time we were going through this little my daughters 14, and we were, and I thought it would be fun to watch some of the 1980s, John Hughes,"
3319.7,3330.7," Keyn movies, I figured she was old enough for the Ferris Bieler's Day off and all that. So one of the movies we got was 16 candles, which in my mind, from memory, was very funny."
3330.7,3339.7," And I thought it would be great. It's got a female protagonist who's a redhead like my daughter, so if I'd treat identify with Molly Ringwald, so we got 16 candles and we watch it. Do you guys, do you guys remember this movie?"
3340.7,3347.7," Yeah. Well, we got 15, 20 minutes into the movie, and along comes the character, long ducked on."
3347.7,3357.7," Yeah. You know, and watching it now in 2008, do you remember what they did every single time in every scene when you first see him?"
3357.7,3363.7," No, do you remember? On the soundtrack, there's a gong. Every single duck."
3363.7,3382.7," Yeah, basically it was like, you know, every time. And to watch it in 2008, with my 14-year-old daughter, who is, you know, a pretty aware kid living in Berkeley, I mean, I didn't have to say a word. She was like, dad, the movie's totally racist."
3382.7,3392.7," Like, it ruined the whole experience. I mean, we based, we ended up finishing it, but we stopped laughing and enjoying the movie because this character kept ruining the movie for us."
3392.7,3404.7," Yeah. And, you know, and everything he says is like, you know, oh, sorry, you missed out whatever, you know, and it's the most like grading that thing and this movie and the thing that got me though, is this movie's not that old."
3404.7,3405.7," No, it's not."
3405.7,3416.7," But at that time in 1984, it was still okay to do that. You know, at that point, the accepted wisdom was you could have an Asian character apparently."
3416.7,3424.7," You could have an Asian character in a movie in this country, give them a stupid ass name that's going to make us giggle, who would click penis."
3424.7,3433.7, And you can even have the convinces Asian actor to read these lines in this offensive way.
3433.7,3441.7," Yep. I mean, we had the same, and this is an older movie, but I remember I was on like a classic movie kick and then we grabbed it breakfast to tell you."
3441.7,3443.7," Yeah, well, that's the other. That one's worse."
3443.7,3445.7, I had no idea that that was in there.
3445.7,3446.7," Yeah, that's right."
3446.7,3448.7, And then you get a guess. Was it Mickey Rooney?
3448.7,3451.7, It's Mickey Rooney dressed like dressed up as an Asian.
3451.7,3452.7, Yeah.
3452.7,3454.7," And he keeps going, he's got like a big buck tee up, big buck tee."
3454.7,3459.7," And he keeps calling her Harigo Rightory, and her name is Halligo Lightly."
3459.7,3463.7," Like, this is like the joke the whole time. And we were just sitting there going, oh my god."
3463.7,3465.7," Yeah, the only thing I remember about this movie now."
3465.7,3468.7," Yeah, which is supposed to be like, it's considered a classic."
3468.7,3471.7," Yeah, it's got Audrey Hepburn in her prime."
3471.7,3473.7, Truman Capotea book.
3473.7,3474.7," Right, Truman Capotea book."
3474.7,3477.7, It's considered a classic and right in the middle of this classic movie.
3477.7,3483.7, You've got Mickey Rooney dressed up with buck teeth talking in fake Asian talk.
3483.7,3486.7," So I mean, do you have a Google glasses on?"
3486.7,3487.7," Yeah, yeah."
3487.7,3488.7," Yeah, yeah."
3488.7,3492.7," I mean, you've got you go ahead 20 years and you're at 16 candles."
3492.7,3495.7, So at least I got an Asian actor doing that.
3495.7,3498.7," That was the advancing made, but they still calling it long duck-dong."
3498.7,3499.7, Yeah.
3499.7,3506.7," But I mean, I guess just the point relating back is that, you know, that baggage existed all the way up to the 80s"
3506.7,3511.7, that it was okay to just make a movie where you can just make fun of Asian people.
3511.7,3512.7, Right.
3512.7,3516.7," And then there's, you know, that's like the Simpsons or wherever where everyone is a target"
3516.7,3518.7, like it's not so bad.
3518.7,3522.7," Like if you do see the same stereotypes like you know, a poo is obviously, you know, the convenience"
3522.7,3524.7, or owner who's Indian.
3524.7,3528.7, But if you have a whole collection of stereotypes suddenly that makes it okay.
3528.7,3529.7, Right.
3529.7,3531.7," But like if you just have one, it sticks out like us."
3531.7,3540.7," Or the collection of stereotypes and just sort of the collection, you know, the aggregate of these things are telling over time, you know, largely in retrospect too."
3540.7,3545.7," I mean, what what pop culture, you know, some books magazines, movies, games and stuff, choose as they're"
3545.7,3546.7, villains.
3546.7,3549.7, They're often turned out to be telling in a long run.
3549.7,3554.7," Like of course, in the second cold, I mean, in the, um, during the second red scare, and during the cold war,"
3554.7,3561.7," there, you know, we're, we're all these things like invasion of the body snatchers and you have, you know, the end stuff that was parody like in"
3561.7,3566.7," Dr. Strange Love, you know, the communist trying to get your precious bodily fluids and stuff."
3566.7,3570.7," But you have all these, you look at it and you're like, oh, giant insects and stuff after the atomic is."
3570.7,3571.7, Sure.
3571.7,3572.7, What are we afraid of?
3572.7,3579.7," You look and it's like, well, it's a movie about a giant ant. Like, what are you trying to say it has something to do with culture and that people are maybe afraid of like"
3579.7,3587.7," the dawn of the nuclear age and things going, you know, the atomic age and things going going crazy, you know, and then, you look at games for the longest time."
3587.7,3594.7," I mean, it meant Russian attack and stuff, you know, there was like the commemies, that was the, it is Rambo stuff like that in the commemies with the enemies."
3594.7,3600.7," Then like for the longest time now in a great many games, it's, you know, Arab enemies."
3600.7,3604.7," Great though, is it Nazis never go out of style, you know, that's why."
3604.7,3607.7," Fads will come and go, you sure you Russians are bad guys for a while."
3607.7,3610.7," Then you got your middle leacions, but the Nazis will always be around."
3610.7,3613.7," I must say, hey, um, worms are the heart."
3613.7,3625.7," So, I'm like, I don't know what to say because I'm, I'm also sick of reading any preview that has to do with like, that starts off with killing Nazis never gets old."
3625.7,3627.7, Many of those.
3627.7,3630.7," So like, yeah, I just, I mean, maybe there's some future."
3630.7,3639.7," I don't imagine that there's going to be like some trend that like, you know, Riseny was the start of the new, you know, whatever, whatever the city, if it turns out to be in Haiti or something,"
3639.7,3645.7," or if it turns out to actually be in Africa, it's in fact in, you know, Somalia or whatever."
3645.7,3650.7," It's going to be a start of a trend like that, but I think it's worth looking at, what are we, who are we making our enemies in these games?"
3650.7,3653.7," And then not only that, I think the points just is valid."
3653.7,3656.7," So some people are like, well, why would you be just pissed off about this game?"
3656.7,3659.7, And no one says anything about these other games called DidiFore came up.
3659.7,3663.7," It was like, well, yeah, actually when it did came up, it was a point ahead."
3663.7,3671.7," Remember talking with Rory, we're like, well, because you can't have, you know, because there's no one in this game world other than just these angry, you know, later on Russians,"
3671.7,3679.7, but there's just these angry airbodies with guns and you shoot them and you're going through houses and buildings and office and stuff that there's no one in there that doesn't have a gun that's trying to kill you.
3679.7,3689.7," They, well, there's an implicit message in here that this world is popular with that Saudi Arabia, they call it something else that's unnamed in the game is got nothing but,"
3689.7,3699.7," do you want to kill you in it, you know, and there are plenty of people who do want to kill you there, I'm sure, but it's like, it's just a side effect of the way it is part of its technology, you know, if you're going to have,"
3699.7,3706.7," it's very easy to have just an enemy and say, I used to run out to this one point of cover and then wait there and then shoot it, you and try to kill you."
3706.7,3721.7," And then when you kill him to have his clone run out from the same spawn clause and do the same thing, it's easier to do that than it is to have, you know, someone screaming and freaking out and hiding when you're running through their house in the middle of a firefight and then not only that,"
3721.7,3732.7," then that poses the other host of problems, like, well, what happens if you accidentally shoot them, are you making a game that depicts, you know, American and British soldiers as just in discriminant, you know, war criminals,"
3732.7,3740.7," and then you have to punish them and make the game start over and piss off and then are you like having directly negative consequences on gameplay because it's so there's all these reasons that you're like,"
3740.7,3747.7," that limit you and that make your that help control what the game is other than just like, well, we don't want to do it or we want to do it."
3747.7,3760.7," I mean, there's, there's a big bunch of reasons behind it, but it, it also means that games in some ways aren't the best suited for these really thorough looks at, you know, big issue things."
3760.7,3769.7," And this, that we could use to lead a very nice situation. You are top very nice. So today's, all things considered on national public radio."
3769.7,3784.7," There's a quick segment and there's some a re of it is that some say video game makers are squandering their cultural cloud by not making games that contribute to the natural, national conversation about important issues such as the war and Iraq or teen pregnancy."
3784.7,3790.7, The segment then tried to email out. I was just trying to imagine a teen pregnancy video game.
3790.7,3793.7, That's a little bit more violence.
3793.7,3803.7," So part of part of the discussion, you know, that they had little sound by it's for taking from interviews and they had Harvey Smith who worked on midways,"
3803.7,3813.7, but there's a lot of things that are going to be a lot of different ways.
3813.7,3821.7," But it was like a game's cost, because it's a great deal money to make triple leg games and stuff."
3821.7,3829.7," And it's like you really do need to be concerned with the bottom line and it's making a game that has something significant to say or has, you know,"
3829.7,3833.7," participate in this, the so called national conversation about an important issue."
3833.7,3842.7," Is that going to help it recover the best costs to make that or is it going to be that if it's a shooter like black site, the shooting part works."
3842.7,3850.7," Now it was, it was caught, kind of my problem with black size and it wanted to do some interesting things with its plot, but the game itself was a piece of shit."
3850.7,3857.7, So all that was kind of like pointless and lost because no one's going to want to play in the first place to even care what they're trying to get some message out of you.
3857.7,3860.7, So that did come up I think that was fair.
3860.7,3870.7," The point that I thought that they missed in the NPR story which disappointed me was the fact that, you know, in the movie industry in 2007 and even six,"
3870.7,3876.7, you had one movie come out about the Iraq or after another and they all tanked.
3876.7,3878.7," I mean it was, it was, it did though."
3878.7,3886.7," In terms of box office they did in the valley of whatever was called, all these movies kind of came and went, nobody went to see them."
3886.7,3891.7," So I felt that, well, because I'm thinking of like, I mean, there's some distance between them."
3891.7,3894.7," So there was a jarhead came out, it did really well."
3894.7,3898.7," That was about the version of the first, yeah, right."
3898.7,3902.7, But that came out after political movies and vision are successful.
3902.7,3908.7," Yeah, they are, but like in this current environment, like in the last year, these movies did not do well."
3908.7,3909.7, But were those good movies?
3909.7,3912.7," I don't even know anything about well, the invalid, whatever."
3912.7,3918.7," I mean, that's the one that got Tommy Lee Jones, an Oscar nomination for what that's worth."
3918.7,3920.7, But we'll see.
3920.7,3930.7," I mean, the serial, I was like, I think that was probably, people were afraid it was going to be a little too preachy and a little too preachy, like, to the left."
3930.7,3935.7," Yeah, that was the Tom Cruise Robert Redford, Marryl Streeple and the Lions for Lambs."
3935.7,3940.7," I mean, there's a bunch of examples of these movies that people didn't go to see, which,"
3940.7,3951.7," I mean, the point, my point being that it's not like in every other art form, you've got these surefire hits."
3951.7,3955.7," Right, based on real world complicated issues."
3955.7,3956.7, Right.
3956.7,3961.7," But we know people are, or that people actually want to deal with that when they're trying to get entertained."
3961.7,3964.7, I think people want to deal with at least the context.
3964.7,3966.7," I mean, look at the success of Call of Duty 4."
3966.7,3967.7, Right.
3968.7,3971.7," Gamers really wanted to, they went with the context."
3971.7,3973.7, They're super fascinated by it.
3973.7,3975.7," I mean, and you look at the responses."
3975.7,3976.7," I mean, a lot of people like it more."
3976.7,3980.7, And I don't think it's just because you could shoot through walls in this iteration of a series.
3980.7,3982.7, I think a lot of it has to do with that.
3982.7,3984.7, You think about it in your in a certain age group.
3984.7,3987.7," And, you know, the esteem's fascinating."
3987.7,3988.7, Residents.
3988.7,3989.7, Yeah.
3989.7,3990.7, But do we want education?
3990.7,3991.7," Do we want educate, mint?"
3991.7,3996.7," In our games, I mean, you start adding, you know, whiffs of, I'm going to teach you about these things in my game and doesn't that start."
3996.7,3997.7," I mean, it's all immediate."
3997.7,4001.7," If you're going to, if you're going to be all like, pre-G."
4001.7,4002.7, Right.
4002.7,4006.7, That's what I did in a compelling way that is more of a star in the game.
4006.7,4007.7," No, yeah."
4007.7,4010.7," No one want, if you told me the movie was a didactic, and I wouldn't be interested in either."
4010.7,4014.7," Because you don't want to, like, say, like, with Jarhead, those are really good movies."
4014.7,4017.7," You don't, it's not there to teach you a lesson."
4017.7,4023.7, It's there to contribute to a conversation and encourage people to join in that conversation.
4023.7,4025.7, To think about these themes and then talk about them.
4025.7,4032.7," And so to that extent, I think games are doing it because there's a conversation as a merge of even about just this trailer for Resident Evil 4."
4032.7,4035.7, And it's ties back in what I was saying about you don't have to necessarily try.
4035.7,4041.7," It's not like you have to say this game has a message and I'm going to, this is a good chance to bring something up."
4041.7,4046.7," A while, two weeks ago, I mentioned reading Ted Rawl in the context to talk about this costume."
4046.7,4050.7," And I, a few people were like, oh, God, you read him what the fuck is wrong with you."
4050.7,4063.7," And I was like really surprising for me to see because it's like, is the assumption that to read any material to say that you can don't and advocate everything in here wholeheartedly."
4063.7,4065.7, That's an idiot's literacy.
4065.7,4066.7, No one dressed that.
4066.7,4071.7," Any good reading is argumentative through and through the whole time you're reading it, sure you're engaging with it."
4071.7,4075.7," So no, but because it's not my bookshelf, it's now my Bible."
4075.7,4077.7, I can read nine comps.
4078.7,4080.7," Yeah, it doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything like that."
4080.7,4087.7," When you open the cover, you're not making, you're not shining a contract to say, I am going to agree with everything I'm about to read."
4087.7,4088.7," Yeah, this is not happened."
4088.7,4095.7," And it's sometimes, yeah, like if the book is doing absolutely nothing but preaching to you as a choir, it can be very boring."
4095.7,4102.7," You know, I mean, like books where I have a really heated response is to, I'm like, last night it was almost like, I almost wanted to talk out loud to a book I'm reading."
4102.7,4108.7," Because it was pissing me off so much, but at the same time, turn a page and like, okay, I really like that, you know, I'm going to go back and forth."
4108.7,4115.7," But so to take it back to the point, let's just, no, it's it's Susan Jacobi's the age of American and reason."
4115.7,4116.7, Then talk about later.
4116.7,4124.7, Part of what was getting he so upset is because her whole cell dismissal of video games is anything but just a junk activity through and through.
4124.7,4125.7, Right.
4125.7,4133.7, And it should be just like beats the shit out of Johnson you for his everything bad is good for you.
4133.7,4135.7," Oh yeah, and all these other things. Yeah."
4135.7,4141.7," And I mean, it's just got some points, but at the same time, in that case, I mean, for every good point she's making on another page, it's like seriously."
4141.7,4144.7, You haven't played a game and you're not aware.
4144.7,4150.7," I mean, you've done some clearly done some research, a little bit of research about games and the kind of games are out there, but not much."
4150.7,4159.7," And this is just like frankly, I'm in the process of I think of writing or a long layer, but anyway, I want it for this NPR thing, there's some good feedback on our message boards and I want it for them."
4159.7,4166.7," And I want to read a few snippets and make sure how you guys react. Okay, to him. So, Perry good and true."
4166.7,4177.7, His reaction was that you can't just have fun anymore. Everything requires substance. This is a struck struck through is this everything requires an agenda.
4177.7,4183.7, And they seem to insinuate when they play hopscotch the first number represents a number of people who are in it who die from tobacco.
4183.7,4189.7, The second two are the number of people who die in Iraq. The third is the number of animal species that go extinct each month.
4189.7,4198.7," And the next set of two are the number of people diagnosed with AIDS in Africa. And we, the last number is how many tons of recyclable trash is not putting the proper container in."
4198.7,4200.7, It's not even a little fun to play.
4200.7,4207.7, You don't need to validate your hobby beyond the fact that it's fun for you. Nobody plays to be moved by some deep statement. You play to play.
4207.7,4212.7, Why the fuck would I want distressing real world issues in my escape from the real world?
4212.7,4216.7," Part of my answer to that is like again, go back to CED4."
4216.7,4221.7," Right. It's totally fond of scapeysam, but distressing issues are in there."
4221.7,4224.7," You know, they are. You don't have to think about them, though."
4224.7,4228.7," You do the fucking new goes off and you die. Sorry, you're a little boy."
4228.7,4230.7, No. Oh no. Sorry.
4230.7,4234.7," Well, I'd say that we pass a Statutal Lamentation."
4234.7,4238.7, We are just games. So many million copies by now.
4238.7,4242.7," So yeah, yeah, I would. That qualifies is."
4242.7,4246.7," Yeah, stress. No, that did have disturbing. There were a few in that game."
4246.7,4248.7, There were. You're right. There are many. Yeah.
4248.7,4249.7, Very beginning of the game. Yeah.
4249.7,4253.7," You're putting the, sure, the point of view of someone who's beep."
4253.7,4255.7, Mm-hmm. And did you appreciate that?
4255.7,4261.7," Or did you do that? I did. I mean, but that's, I mean, this is, that is a great example."
4261.7,4265.7," You're right. CED4 is a great example, but I can't think of many more other than that, though."
4265.7,4269.7," Well, it's possible sometimes, but it is possible. Yes, it's not possible."
4269.7,4272.7, It's possible to do that and still be entertaining.
4272.7,4277.7," Mm-hmm. So yeah. Well, there's bio shark. I mean, you can go play bio shark and say,"
4277.7,4283.7, I love figure now the best way to kill the big daddy. I love finding out the quickest way to harvest this little sister.
4283.7,4289.7," Mm-hmm. But, right, and as you play, the game also is, is saying many, many things."
4289.7,4295.7," The various characters and their journals, the way that the world's constructed, the way that the different figures in this world are interacting with one another."
4295.7,4299.7," And the positions they're in, those are all making serious significant statements,"
4299.7,4303.7," Thought-provoking statements. And it's like, this is what I mean, you can have to take it down."
4303.7,4307.7," I need it, too, because it's just, or you could think about it afterward, right? I just say,"
4307.7,4311.7," I mean, that's purple. I, that's how I, by a shot."
4311.7,4316.7," I mean, should I talk about Halo, what purple? Go on."
4316.7,4321.7," I mean, and this isn't, like, you know, a lot of this discussion is about politics specifically,"
4321.7,4325.7," but like, if you look at like a game like Silent Hill 2 where the mechanics of the game are not what's fun about it,"
4325.7,4332.7," but it's like, the really disturbing and psychological ramifications of certain imagery and certain things that happened in it."
4332.7,4335.7," And like, that's where I extract my quote unquote fun, even though it's not,"
4335.7,4341.7," what the fun? It's just like interpreting these messages and seeing that, hey,"
4341.7,4346.7," pyramid head kind of means something here. And like, I kind of, I get what they're saying."
4346.7,4356.7," And like, oh my god, this guy did that. Yeah, it's just all of these like, realizations that are fun in like their own unique definition of fun."
4356.7,4359.7," I don't know what I'm really saying there, but it's just like,"
4360.7,4362.7, fun is different when you're talking.
4362.7,4367.7," Well, part of the part of the fun in portal, everyone talks about is figuring out what it means."
4367.7,4370.7, What does it mean? What does it mean in the context of its own story?
4370.7,4375.7, Is there anything else to it? What does this cake shit keeps coming up? What's this about?
4375.7,4379.7," You know, I mean, so again, like it is a response to that."
4379.7,4384.7," I absolutely see what he means. And I think that like, the example he's talking about is a die-dactic game."
4384.7,4387.7," At the point when this, this hypothetical hilarious, the hypothetical,"
4387.7,4390.7," the hopscotch game, is not about hopscotch at all. Right."
4390.7,4394.7," It's, it's, it's crudely about teaching you and more, analyzing. And that's bad."
4394.7,4397.7," That's, that's, that's crap. That's not art. Right."
4397.7,4400.7," That's, you know, so here's another response that was cool from face crank."
4400.7,4403.7," I don't know if it's cool, I think it was worth quoting all this light after everything."
4403.7,4409.7," So to try and claim that black sight wasn't some way of cultural high point or in any way a criticism of modern political notions,"
4409.7,4410.7, lacks credibility.
4410.7,4416.7, I also take issue with bogus notion that the game industry is some sort of monolithic interest with the unified sense of direction.
4416.7,4421.7," What EA wants to accomplish with madness different than what 2K wants to accomplish with bio-shock,"
4421.7,4426.7, where is the former's of means of entertainment? The latter's of means of commentary as well as being entertaining.
4426.7,4427.7, Okay. So I agree with that.
4427.7,4431.7, The paradox that dogs gaming is in its very name.
4431.7,4436.7," When were gamers ever supposed to be, games ever supposed to be high-art or culture?"
4436.7,4441.7, And how do you go any length at all to make something that must be first entertaining before it attempts to be art?
4441.7,4446.7, So it might say that the art that goes into a game design qualifies the medium as being an architect that hardly suffices.
4446.7,4451.7," Every mass market movie requires volumes of costume design, set design, artistic direction, and so on."
4451.7,4461.7, But does that make these movies the same kind of art that say compared toy story to no country for old men? Perfect.
4462.7,4468.7, And here's the last one that see if you respond to.
4468.7,4472.7," Shets says, games are for fun rarely become art in any sense of the word."
4472.7,4476.7, So when it feels conflicted about the use of military force simply isn't going to play a shooter game.
4476.7,4479.7, So it hardly matters what the content is from their perspective.
4479.7,4481.7, In the end it's just entertainment.
4481.7,4484.7, But still to be able to enjoy a work game for fun in excitement.
4484.7,4487.7, It doesn't want to have to accept the premise I proposed.
4488.7,4493.7, And I can't answer that as no. I mean I love war games. I love shooters.
4493.7,4498.7, And I sometimes do feel conflicted about the use of military force depending on the circumstances.
4498.7,4508.7, That's part of the question is when when is force used and how is it used and it could be absolutely like I'm totally fascinated by the use of force.
4508.7,4513.7," You know, and how it works out from tactical points of view and all these things and social and historical points of view."
4513.7,4521.7, And that doesn't mean you advocate that you're supposed to have a situation or they don't regret it on the part of the part of our nation's history and things like this.
4521.7,4523.7, I do.
4523.7,4525.7, So you can't play a shot.
4525.7,4528.7," No, I just think we should kick ass all the time."
4528.7,4531.7," Okay. So yeah, games were made for you."
4531.7,4533.7, America right around.
4533.7,4535.7, Love it or leave it.
4535.7,4538.7, So what do you any thoughts on this?
4538.7,4539.7, May.
4539.7,4542.7, I guess not Ryan because Ryan's a past out about half an hour ago.
4542.7,4545.7, I'm here.
4545.7,4546.7, Okay.
4546.7,4547.7, You talking about.
4547.7,4549.7, All right.
4549.7,4550.7, Yeah.
4550.7,4552.7," Well, I mean, I think you."
4552.7,4556.7," I think you said, right, and these actually were amazing."
4556.7,4560.7, Pulse that you read here. Those were really well thought out.
4560.7,4565.7," You know, I think that."
4566.7,4568.7, I like purple.
4568.7,4573.7, That's what I think.
4573.7,4574.7, I don't know.
4574.7,4575.7, I have nothing to add.
4575.7,4578.7," Yeah. I mean, we'll just the original NPR thing."
4578.7,4587.7," I mean, it's good that there's yet another media story that's about games that's not simply saying that hey, by the way, you can rape hookers in this game."
4587.7,4591.7," Right. I mean, it was it was good in that story that they took kind of an open point of view."
4591.7,4592.7, They didn't.
4592.7,4594.7, They started on the attack.
4594.7,4596.7, Games aren't doing this and that's bad.
4596.7,4598.7," I mean, they raised the very question."
4598.7,4601.7," Should games do, doesn't matter the game to it."
4601.7,4602.7," I mean, and there's some do."
4602.7,4605.7," They even acknowledge that some do, but they're, they're small time games."
4605.7,4609.7," Sometimes, or they're like, in full-time games that you're talking about."
4609.7,4610.7, Sure. There's a difference there.
4610.7,4617.7," Well, they also brought up this whole notion of player control, which, and they break up the same."
4617.7,4618.7, Right.
4618.7,4619.7, Yeah.
4619.7,4633.7," Yeah. There's, how can you have a message in a game where it's totally up to the player to determine whether you're going to torture these people or whether you're going to have them live out normal happy lives or whether you're going to have them, you know, go down a dark corporate path."
4633.7,4636.7," And, you know, the answer is like some games aren't like that."
4636.7,4640.7," Yeah. That struck me as a cop out because you're like, again, with most games."
4640.7,4645.7," And this is part of the point of Bioshaw, because you really have little to no control."
4645.7,4646.7, Yeah.
4646.7,4651.7, You're still being told a story and the blanks you're filling in are so specific is to be meaning ultimately meaningless.
4651.7,4652.7, Yeah.
4652.7,4655.7, So shoot this guy first or this guy second. You're still shooting them.
4655.7,4659.7," Yeah. I mean, and this, again, to bring up the little stupid art."
4659.7,4669.7," Our green sword argument that was like Roger Ebert, Braille, and said like the main reason he thinks they can't is because there is no, there is no authorial control."
4669.7,4670.7," No, no."
4670.7,4682.7," The game makers aren't ultimately in charge. And then, you know, Bioshaw is the counter argument to that or other games like Bioshaw, for you're like, well, here's a game that's telling you to know, can the beans knows exactly what he's doing."
4682.7,4683.7, Right.
4683.7,4684.7, So the story is well.
4684.7,4685.7," I mean, I sure."
4685.7,4686.7, I just have to think of those two games together because.
4686.7,4687.7, Right.
4687.7,4691.7, But I think a guy like Roger Ebert probably doesn't even understand what a game is in the modern world.
4691.7,4692.7, Right.
4692.7,4693.7, He's thinking that's the element.
4693.7,4696.7, That's the property doesn't even know what games exist.
4696.7,4699.7," It have stories, right, to him. They're just thinking that you should."
4699.7,4700.7, And I want to shoot it.
4700.7,4702.7, Thanks for the old Roger Ebert argument again.
4702.7,4707.7," Well, but it is that generational thing. We can put it in the context of Susan Chicobe who's book, you know, I just mentioned it."
4707.7,4713.7," It's like, you can tell like, if you're going to be say, you say you're an old, you know, cross the music critic."
4713.7,4718.7," And you can listen to, you know, you say you're normal. You're still working in the classical field."
4718.7,4721.7, You can listen to someone's hip-hop record and it won't take you any longer.
4721.7,4723.7, And it takes anyone else to listen to it.
4723.7,4728.7," But to play a game, not understand it. Like if you were to try to give, you know, like one thing I want to say,"
4728.7,4733.7," like one thing I want to point out to her just copying you here, isn't the way that it works and that it's like,"
4733.7,4738.7," to say because her argument is that, you know, when you, when you read a book or something, I mean,"
4738.7,4740.7," she's really big on literacy and just, you know,"
4740.7,4743.7," bomoning the fact that that's all these other, sorry, you know,"
4743.7,4750.7, these other things American society that people are less and less interested in reading and the traditional sense.
4750.7,4754.7," You know, and she differentiates this between the kind of reading we do online and how it's, you know,"
4754.7,4755.7, qualitatively different.
4755.7,4767.7," But so she said that when you read a good book, you're fostering thought and all these other things that are beneficial outside of the context of understanding that book's sequel."
4767.7,4776.7," The point you want to make is that the only skills you get from playing a video game no matter how deviously challenging they might be is a skill that's going to be useful only in,"
4776.7,4783.7, and not even just useful is going to be worthwhile only in the context of beating another game that's even that more challenging than the other.
4783.7,4784.7, That's totally or anything.
4784.7,4785.7, It's totally offensive.
4785.7,4791.7," This is why I was almost screaming at the book because I was reading as I was going to bed because, you know, when, you know, the case,"
4791.7,4797.7," the case, the point for, you know, I could think of a company here as because I played so much as that when we're playing as a team,"
4797.7,4801.7," we're not only thinking about our ability to react to unpredictable, you know,"
4801.7,4805.7," changes in circumstance, our ability to work together to establish leadership, you know,"
4805.7,4809.7," the flexibility and all these things to see through disagreement, you know,"
4810.7,4812.7," we're when someone's like, let's do this tactic."
4812.7,4817.7," You know, this is we're going to lose or, you know, let's do this, finding a compromise for that."
4817.7,4822.7," When someone is ready to quit the game because they're so bummed out like dealing with their morale and getting them to like,"
4822.7,4823.7," come on man, we could do it."
4823.7,4826.7," I mean, all these things, those are absolutely, you know,"
4826.7,4832.7," you know, they're from her pragmatic, you know, criteria for evaluating the quality, the worthwhile of a game."
4832.7,4836.7," It totally passes the test because all those are problem solving skills, you know,"
4836.7,4839.7," social skills, you know, social skills, right, use on the daily basis."
4839.7,4844.7," Right. You'll work it even reduce it down to a more abstract that, you know,"
4844.7,4849.7, that doing logic puzzles is just exercising your mind in that way in the same way that doing crossword puzzles.
4849.7,4855.7," You know, you can probably get the same writer and have her talk about crossword puzzles and she's not going to make that kind of claim."
4855.7,4856.7, Right.
4856.7,4859.7, But I totally see that as this sort of like a generational bias.
4859.7,4862.7," I mean, and we have that, but that's the thing is because it's like, yeah,"
4862.7,4867.7," we can't get, you can't just immediately access a video game and say, okay,"
4867.7,4871.7," I kind of get it. Even though like, you know, that music critic, the classic music critic,"
4871.7,4874.7," first picks up a hip-hop albums, this is going to listen to it and be like,"
4874.7,4876.7," this proves my point exactly, right."
4876.7,4879.7," It's just, just position, but I mean,"
4879.7,4881.7," at least you'll listen to it, right."
4881.7,4883.7, It's that a Google it and say video games.
4883.7,4888.7," Well, once again, the answer to all of this was that we just have to have all the old people die."
4889.7,4894.7," Once they're all dead, then it's just us left and we grew up with games."
4894.7,4898.7," And hopefully this argument, maybe not this generation, but the next one,"
4898.7,4902.7, this whole games aren't this in games aren't that won't be around anymore.
4902.7,4910.7, Because the only people left on the planet will be the people who actually grew up with them and have a more innate deep understanding of what they are and what they aren't.
4910.7,4915.7," To be fair, if everyone is doing nothing but playing their playing games,"
4916.7,4920.7," then watching trouble, this other shit, then that's frightening to me as well."
4920.7,4923.7," I'm just not pointing out, we're trying to, you know, and guy, we're having this discussion,"
4923.7,4928.7," and it's like, the people are jumping in and just like repeatedly missing our point."
4928.7,4929.7, Uh-huh.
4929.7,4932.7," Then you got the thing, where you may turn COD off tonight."
4932.7,4933.7, Uh-huh.
4933.7,4934.7," Well, maybe we'll just be like,"
4934.7,4938.7," Limless brains and jars staring at screens, you know, won't matter."
4938.7,4940.7, The shiny.
4940.7,4943.7, That what would be the point of keeping those brains around then.
4946.7,4947.7, I'll knock.
4947.7,4949.7, Yeah.
4949.7,4952.7, Let's talk about Ray Cruz.
4952.7,4953.7, Well.
4953.7,4955.7, Let's have it.
4955.7,4957.7, Let's be hair splitting singularity.
4957.7,4959.7, Uh.
4959.7,4968.7," Well, because you know, I've read Ray Cruz, the future is his, his, I'll take is that because technology improves it at a quantifiably exponential rate."
4968.7,4972.7," That means that somewhere it will, in the predictably near future,"
4972.7,4977.7," we're going to hit this point and we're able to make machines that can function in the same way that,"
4977.7,4984.7," sorry, it's such a patronizing tone of voice for this, but the machines have function with the exact same capacity as the human mind."
4984.7,4985.7, Right.
4985.7,4987.7," On that silence, we'll be able to put our,"
4987.7,4993.7," basically the equivalent of our, our conscious, the process of our brain onto some sort of,"
4993.7,4996.7," um, non-organic, uh,"
4996.7,4998.7," storage medium,"
4998.7,5004.7," continue to exist with that body and then the point though, then there's those that are like, well, if this is the case, the machines become so,"
5004.7,5006.7," you know, so, so efficient."
5006.7,5016.7," Then why would they want to bother putting, putting the guys, uh, the guy who, whatever, who eats a vat of gravy and wipes his, his mouth off with his breast."
5016.7,5022.7," I didn't want to put, but, but, but, but taking up a hard drive space with that."
5022.7,5024.7, Fracking toasters.
5025.7,5028.7," I have to watch, I have to watch, uh, last week's episode still."
5028.7,5030.7," I was sad of, uh, spoilers, please."
5030.7,5034.7," That was out of, uh, out of my home last weekend, so I missed that."
5034.7,5035.7, I was just a home.
5035.7,5039.7," I was away on a, on a, on a three day, uh, get away with my wife."
5039.7,5041.7, Yoga retreat.
5041.7,5042.7," Oh, boy."
5042.7,5044.7, Did a lot of yoga and tricks?
5044.7,5046.7," No, not a can't trick."
5046.7,5049.7," She's regular all, all-American yoga."
5049.7,5050.7, Who's thing there?
5050.7,5051.7, Yeah.
5052.7,5056.7," Not the whole time, what's doing yoga like, you know, nine to five was like a couple hours a day."
5056.7,5061.7," And then we would just go hang up by the river and, basically, I just got away from electronics."
5061.7,5069.7," I promised an electronic free weekend, but I somehow managed to bring my PSP anyway."
5069.7,5071.7, What did you play on it?
5071.7,5076.7," Well, I got a bunch of games from our game giveaway, uh, that we had here."
5076.7,5078.7," Well, that we have at one of the comv events in a while."
5078.7,5083.7," We have a lot of time to walk pile up, and then we have kind of a lottery system to pass them out amongst everyone's"
5083.7,5086.7," No, while being, this is the first time we've done it."
5086.7,5087.7, Yeah.
5087.7,5088.7, Everyone's going to have starting now.
5088.7,5089.7, We just did one.
5089.7,5090.7," Like, as a result of many."
5090.7,5096.7," Each year who saw us pass it used to be that like, well, EGM has always done this."
5096.7,5097.7, Right.
5097.7,5100.7," And here, so people would just, it's a CGW such gift."
5100.7,5105.7," If people would just keep whatever they got, but it was like, the wealth wasn't distributed equally."
5106.7,5110.7, Because if you people would get all the games and the rest of this wouldn't get through it.
5110.7,5111.7, Right.
5111.7,5114.7, We would get like eight copies of the latest Sims expansion.
5114.7,5117.7," To be remembered, like one copy of company Pharaoh's."
5117.7,5118.7, I kind of think.
5118.7,5119.7, Yeah.
5119.7,5120.7," Well, we're not naming names."
5120.7,5123.7, So we're not naming names of those who scored games.
5123.7,5127.7, So I brought the pile of stuff that I got at the game giveaway.
5127.7,5132.7," And I got a bunch of PSP stuff on purpose, because for years, it's been the dedicated"
5133.7,5135.7, Luminat 300 dollar Luminat machine.
5135.7,5137.7, I felt like bitter and frugal.
5137.7,5138.7, That how much are they now?
5138.7,5140.7, The PSP I think I did pay that.
5140.7,5141.7, That it was like three and a ball.
5141.7,5142.7," Yeah, because I got one at the beginning."
5142.7,5143.7, I got one just recently.
5143.7,5144.7, It was sub 200.
5144.7,5145.7, I can't remember.
5145.7,5146.7, It was one in 1999 or 1999.
5146.7,5148.7, Maybe M.I. exaggerating was it ever 300?
5148.7,5150.7, Maybe it was one that maybe was 250.
5150.7,5152.7, So I'm a shing.
5152.7,5154.7, I know I paid a lot.
5154.7,5155.7, I know I did.
5155.7,5158.7, So I got a picked up a bunch.
5158.7,5161.7, I picked up a wipe out pulse.
5161.7,5162.7, Nice.
5162.7,5163.7, I got that too.
5163.7,5169.7, PSGT Liberty City's stories.
5169.7,5171.7, Storytlibricities.
5171.7,5175.7, That's an essential PSP game.
5175.7,5183.7, So you say the logo that says essential PSP game or it's just one of Ryan's essentials.
5183.7,5185.7," Oh, I know what you're talking about."
5185.7,5186.7, He's being sinister and quite.
5186.7,5189.7, Then I got a GTA.
5189.7,5194.7, I got a tennis game like Sega Superstar tennis Superstar tennis.
5194.7,5196.7," Yeah, I got that in some of the day and you go."
5196.7,5198.7," Yeah, I got it somehow."
5198.7,5200.7," No, no, no, it's not that."
5200.7,5201.7," No, no, no, no."
5201.7,5204.7, It's more like a top semesters kind of.
5204.7,5205.7, Virtua tennis.
5205.7,5207.7, Virtua tennis maybe.
5207.7,5208.7, You're just making shit up.
5208.7,5209.7, To the one making it up.
5209.7,5210.7, Whatever the scoff.
5210.7,5214.7," Anyway, you get to do like a world tour playing tennis."
5214.7,5216.7, I'm certainly certainly certainly certainly listeners now.
5216.7,5217.7, I'm sure I can.
5217.7,5219.7, Sounds like a tennis game.
5219.7,5220.7, Some other sports game.
5220.7,5222.7, And then I picked up just that curiosity.
5222.7,5223.7, I picked up Sims.
5223.7,5227.7, Tennis cast away just to see what it was like on another platform.
5227.7,5231.7," But all I they changed them pretty fundamentally and make them more like,"
5231.7,5233.7, Goal oriented games that aren't released.
5233.7,5234.7," Yeah, games."
5234.7,5236.7," Well, that one's totally crap on it."
5236.7,5238.7," Oh, and I got a collection of pinball."
5238.7,5239.7, I got Williams pinball.
5239.7,5240.7," No, no, it's a."
5240.7,5242.7," Did you get, well, there's the Gottlieb pinball clutch."
5242.7,5243.7, Gottlieb.
5243.7,5249.7," That's okay, but I also got the Williams collection for we, which has got much better game."
5249.7,5250.7, We have a different.
5250.7,5251.7," Yeah, we're from different areas."
5251.7,5253.7, So maybe like the really old simple boards.
5253.7,5256.7," But I kind of, I like like, you know, we're a win and pinball."
5256.7,5257.7," No, I'm not saying."
5257.7,5258.7, I'm not saying you do.
5258.7,5259.7, But it's a possibility.
5259.7,5260.7, It's a possibility.
5260.7,5261.7, You were not in the front of it.
5261.7,5263.7," It could be like, like, you could be like, what I can."
5263.7,5265.7," I can't focus up with this like, clickety, clickety,"
5265.7,5268.7," Circus of plastic, you know, and rotating part."
5268.7,5269.7, You are absolutely right.
5269.7,5270.7, Yes.
5270.7,5271.7, And I like that.
5271.7,5272.7, That was right.
5272.7,5273.7," Yeah, that's fine."
5273.7,5274.7, We're from different areas.
5274.7,5275.7, Yeah.
5275.7,5277.7," So the thing about the Gali one, it's cool is that you can go through."
5277.7,5281.7, It's sort of like an RK up in ball museum and they have some really old ones.
5281.7,5282.7, Yeah.
5282.7,5283.7, It's quite where good spot.
5283.7,5285.7, There's three bumpers up in the top.
5285.7,5286.7, We have two flippers.
5286.7,5289.7, And the rest of the board is just like a wasteland of smooth wood.
5289.7,5290.7, Yep.
5290.7,5291.7, And they have those.
5291.7,5293.7," And they do have some different, they have some different,"
5293.7,5295.7, four types of ramps and traps and things like that.
5295.7,5296.7, Quadruple flippers.
5296.7,5297.7, Yeah.
5297.7,5298.7, That's pretty cool.
5298.7,5299.7, Yeah.
5299.7,5300.7, Pretty fun on the PSP.
5300.7,5307.7," The ones I ended up gravitating towards just over the weekend for no particular reason whatsoever were GTA,"
5307.7,5314.7," which I thought was pretty amusing because I was doing this whole peaceful retreat away from the city, away from nature."
5314.7,5317.7," You know, my wife didn't even know I had the PSP."
5317.7,5319.7," And then later night, you know, I'm playing GTA."
5319.7,5321.7, I felt kind of bad about that.
5321.7,5322.7, I'm doing your days work.
5322.7,5323.7, Yeah.
5323.7,5324.7, Pretty much.
5324.7,5325.7, Yeah.
5325.7,5327.7, The car McBanlon shifting the other way.
5327.7,5328.7, Yeah.
5328.7,5331.7, Then I just because I couldn't help it.
5331.7,5338.7, And it's where I'm at now after like three days of still being like the PSP is going to be my machine for the next few days just for fun.
5338.7,5339.7, I went back to LuminS.
5339.7,5340.7, You did.
5340.7,5341.7, Yeah.
5341.7,5342.7, I got that.
5342.7,5344.7, I got a bunch of PSP games from the giveaways well.
5344.7,5346.7, And I'm going through them one by one.
5346.7,5349.7, And finding myself for the most part really disappointed.
5349.7,5353.7, I picked up some of the origins thinking that this looks cool like really high production value.
5353.7,5356.7," And I just, you know, I've played God of War was great."
5356.7,5358.7, I think those fantastic PSP games.
5358.7,5360.7, But so I started playing Silent Hill.
5360.7,5362.7," And it was like, I don't know."
5362.7,5364.7, I played it maybe for for two hours.
5364.7,5369.7," And I got to the point where I, I mean, most games are the way that I'm about to describe."
5369.7,5376.7," But this one is especially the perfect embodiment of where the design is to say, we really want to tell you a story."
5376.7,5378.7, This is going to be the carrot that's going to lead you on.
5378.7,5380.7, And we're always going to keep it like a foot in front of your face.
5380.7,5388.7, But what the game is actually going to consist of is we'll create some geometry called a hospital to never give it a number of rooms.
5388.7,5391.7, And we're going to keep you in a certain part of this building.
5391.7,5395.7, And then we'll have a piece of a of a multipart puzzle in each room.
5395.7,5398.7, And we're going to keep you going back and forth between these rooms.
5398.7,5401.7, Maybe now and then we'll put it down monster out for you to hit the death of the hammer.
5401.7,5407.7, With them there will be like say you need to get seven plastic organs to stick in a plastic could ever.
5408.7,5417.7, And you got to go to one room to get to get a clue to get another than you go in that in another room and get a clue to get another clue to get another piece of the organ.
5417.7,5423.7, And you go on and on you're like okay I've been going back and forth because he's fucking rooms for 30 minutes.
5423.7,5428.7, And as in sight there's this one door I know I basically need like a pair of eyeballs to open.
5428.7,5430.7, I'm going to get to this door and it's all going to be good.
5430.7,5432.7, They're going to give me a little bit more story and things going to happen.
5432.7,5436.7, But no you do it and it's like here's another little wing of the hospital.
5436.7,5441.7, And you're going to do this again for another 30 minutes but it's basically I just seen it.
5441.7,5449.7, You know like I would rather watch the 25 minute machine of the entire story and left out the part where I went back and forth between rooms.
5449.7,5454.7, The last thing for how many hours the game isn't total.
5454.7,5458.7, It's just a really shitty just design I think.
5458.7,5463.7, I mean it's well just you know making the game longer for no reason just right for artificial methods.
5463.7,5471.7, It made me also appreciate why I risen he will for seemed like such a step forward for the series and even though the resumes has never been as bad as something.
5471.7,5474.7, He'll in this respect but it's like you're always.
5474.7,5482.7, Feel as though you are moving somewhere new you know you'll never keep you in an area too long you'll never like just basically tell you.
5482.7,5485.7, We don't got that much level here so let's go really slow.
5485.7,5488.7, And enjoy the level we're going to give you.
5488.7,5490.7, You know.
5490.7,5495.7, So yeah did make me appreciate that and the even previous like console based on hills are much better.
5495.7,5503.7, I think that this was handled by like a outsource to a studio and while they got the vibe and they got all the pieces of the formula right it's gotten under the magic and it's even.
5503.7,5512.7, Double frustrating because not only are you in the hospital they find even more ways to to get their monies worth from the jumps because there's the dark world that you entered.
5512.7,5515.7, You go and touch a mirror and it's the same thing covered with like.
5515.7,5516.7, Like you should.
5516.7,5517.7, Yeah.
5517.7,5518.7, Yeah.
5518.7,5519.7, I always get the rest in the dirt.
5519.7,5520.7, Yeah.
5520.7,5521.7, Yeah.
5521.7,5522.7, I like those games.
5522.7,5526.7, I haven't played any of the I've only played the canon ones like 1234.
5526.7,5527.7, Yeah.
5527.7,5528.7, And I love the early.
5528.7,5531.7, I really want to see I always talk about for the room.
5531.7,5534.7, I want to see that remade with like.
5534.7,5540.7, I mean the room was just premise of it is so fantastic if they do something more if it make the rest of the game.
5540.7,5541.7, Good.
5541.7,5542.7, Yeah.
5542.7,5545.7, The room had like what you were describing almost for me like the actual game of it.
5545.7,5549.7, It was so much more of a more dreadful read than even the other two.
5549.7,5550.7, Yeah.
5550.7,5551.7, I played before two and three.
5551.7,5552.7, That was the boomer.
5552.7,5558.7, And I was like the room itself was such an awesome idea and then they went in such an awesome direction with it.
5558.7,5561.7, Like when they kind of take your safety space away.
5561.7,5563.7, But that's just a shoving.
5563.7,5565.7, I would love to see like those.
5565.7,5570.7, I would like model if there's someone just outright steal that idea and do it like.
5570.7,5574.7," You know, because I could be on playing condemned to him like this is such fantastic gameplay."
5574.7,5576.7, It's this silent hill played like this.
5576.7,5580.7, Silent hill for the room played like this or what if this game had.
5580.7,5582.7, You know the setup of the other game.
5582.7,5583.7, It would be.
5583.7,5584.7, It blows those two need to get married.
5584.7,5586.7, I got to play condemned to.
5586.7,5587.7, I hear nothing with good things.
5587.7,5588.7, I started it.
5588.7,5589.7, Let your wife catch a plane.
5589.7,5590.7, I didn't.
5590.7,5591.7, It's a play pretty hard core.
5591.7,5592.7, But nasty.
5592.7,5593.7, Yeah.
5593.7,5594.7, Yes.
5594.7,5595.7, It's.
5595.7,5596.7, Yeah.
5596.7,5598.7, I started playing the second one because I got that in the game giveaway.
5598.7,5599.7, Yep.
5599.7,5600.7, And I hadn't played the first one.
5600.7,5601.7, Should I go back?
5601.7,5602.7, Because I'm like.
5602.7,5603.7, No.
5603.7,5604.7, I was going.
5604.7,5605.7, I was just in a way.
5605.7,5608.7, I never finished the first one because it was like.
5608.7,5613.7, It seems like I should know something about like why this character is experiencing this thing.
5613.7,5615.7, Go to Wikipedia or what is doing.
5615.7,5616.7, Yeah.
5616.7,5617.7, Just maybe just we the.
5617.7,5618.7, Okay.
5618.7,5619.7, We need the.
5619.7,5620.7, We're the Ricky entry.
5620.7,5621.7, It seems like I'm missing some key stuff.
5621.7,5625.7, And maybe maybe the game is intentionally leaving that out.
5625.7,5626.7, Maybe I'm not right.
5626.7,5627.7, No anything.
5627.7,5628.7, Maybe.
5628.7,5629.7, Right.
5629.7,5630.7, You just.
5630.7,5636.7, You become a homeless guy at the end of the the first one apparently because that's how you start the second.
5636.7,5637.7, Mm-hmm.
5637.7,5639.7," But I was able to just sort of you know, go through and appreciate it."
5639.7,5642.7," And again, maybe for that one not so much that like."
5642.7,5646.7, What's up with where are the these tar like sex shit on the roof and what's coming out.
5646.7,5647.7, Right.
5647.7,5650.7, To get me is to just the basic of like.
5650.7,5651.7, That's some scary shit.
5651.7,5652.7, I don't want that on me anymore.
5652.7,5654.7, Not knowing is kind of cool because it is evocative.
5654.7,5655.7, Yeah.
5655.7,5657.7, Kind of make up your own fucked up little story about what's going on there.
5657.7,5658.7, Right.
5658.7,5664.7, Maybe he may be knowing the real truth of diminishing manhandling TV antennas to get some reception on ticket that bike.
5664.7,5666.7, He for that guy to talk to you.
5666.7,5667.7, Mm-hmm.
5667.7,5669.7, Your wife though it's the kind where you'll be embarrassed.
5669.7,5674.7, Your wife will probably directly tell you that this is disgusting and you shouldn't be playing this in your house.
5674.7,5677.7, Because I mean say even though your daughter's definitely you know.
5677.7,5679.7, Getting old enough to deal with.
5679.7,5680.7, Yeah.
5680.7,5681.7, This kind of thing.
5681.7,5685.7, I mean if your wife comes in and she hears a guy go fuck you.
5685.7,5686.7, Yeah.
5686.7,5693.7, After you beat him in the head with the two by four at the nail in it and he reels back and then you grab him in headlock and stick his head in a.
5693.7,5694.7, Sort of tell him in industrial.
5694.7,5701.7, Press and then slowly ratchet the handle down until his head blows up and she sees this and here's the guy screaming as it's happening.
5701.7,5703.7, I think she's going to like.
5703.7,5704.7, Responding.
5704.7,5705.7, I can yell into my daughter's room.
5705.7,5708.7, How's your essay on non-violence coming honey?
5708.7,5711.7, Dye mother fucker.
5712.7,5715.7, They scream that I mean that's part of the impact of is like the guys.
5715.7,5718.7, I mean just like not only is it just get the yeah.
5718.7,5720.7, And that it's for let me vibe of it all.
5720.7,5723.7, Any any game that even just looks like that thing looks on the box or something.
5723.7,5727.7, I just know I'm only playing it on Saturday like when they're shopping.
5727.7,5728.7, Yeah.
5728.7,5729.7, Yeah.
5729.7,5731.7, As soon as they're out of the house I'm like where's the most violent thing in the house.
5731.7,5732.7, Take it.
5732.7,5733.7, Yeah.
5733.7,5737.7, Like or she even walked up you know you go to come across the corpse that's been like basically like.
5737.7,5741.7, You've got to take all these forensic photos and send them back to HQ.
5741.7,5743.7, I haven't done it yet.
5743.7,5745.7, You're taking all these sorry for the spoiler.
5745.7,5749.7, You're taking all these close ups of just this vivisected body.
5749.7,5753.7, And then you've got to pick it up afterward and drag it outside to pick it back to the lab.
5753.7,5754.7, After.
5754.7,5755.7, Yeah.
5755.7,5756.7, Okay.
5756.7,5757.7, Not playing this one.
5757.7,5758.7, Yeah.
5758.7,5760.7, So if you that's another guy's watching me play this one.
5760.7,5763.7, Well I always love those kind of games like alone in the dark anyway.
5763.7,5764.7, Yeah.
5764.7,5766.7, Like just no one's around turn off the lights.
5766.7,5768.7, But that be your your evening.
5768.7,5769.7, Mm-hmm.
5769.7,5770.7, Really fuck you about.
5770.7,5772.7, If it's the right kind of game.
5772.7,5773.7, Mm-hmm.
5773.7,5775.7, Doom did that to me back in the day.
5775.7,5777.7, This is a whole other story.
5777.7,5778.7, Oh yeah.
5778.7,5782.7, This one thing that shoot the demon and the other thing is for these to stay.
5782.7,5783.7, Well yeah.
5783.7,5784.7, Feels like all these guys.
5784.7,5785.7, Yeah.
5785.7,5791.7, So I think our our anger your listeners this week may make a note of the fact that we didn't really talk about PC games.
5791.7,5792.7, Yeah.
5792.7,5794.7, We talked about.
5795.7,5796.7, Yeah.
5796.7,5798.7, We talked about computer gaming world's old history.
5798.7,5801.7," Anyway, we're uh this is a new GFW radio."
5801.7,5803.7, We can do it over the fuck we want.
5803.7,5806.7, I think we talked about themes that we're supposed to the old games.
5806.7,5807.7, Yeah.
5807.7,5808.7, Yeah.
5808.7,5809.7, Where we had a rigid.
5809.7,5810.7, What am I saying?
5810.7,5811.7, Yeah.
5811.7,5812.7, What did that even mean just now?
5812.7,5813.7, This is fabulous.
5813.7,5814.7, Yeah.
5814.7,5815.7, That's epic set schedule.
5815.7,5816.7, Yeah.
5816.7,5817.7, 2006 that's going to be the code.
5817.7,5821.7, Every time every time you do one of these things straight at us.
5821.7,5823.7, What was odd there was it came out of my mouth with like toll.
5823.7,5826.7, Confidence like I knew it was 2006.
5826.7,5827.7, Yeah.
5827.7,5828.7, It was like maybe it was for a second.
5828.7,5829.7, Maybe it was for me.
5829.7,5830.7, Maybe that's what happened.
5830.7,5833.7, You boiled some water and it took the pan and stuck it in the cupboard.
5833.7,5837.7, You know with the boiling water and it when you're done and then you went and you put your uh
5837.7,5841.7, and then you're going to take your context out and you just squirted your hand full of soap.
5841.7,5843.7, And you're hair jail or something.
5843.7,5845.7, I don't know what's going on.
5845.7,5846.7, I don't know what's going on.
5846.7,5847.7, I don't know.
5847.7,5849.7, These are odd.
5849.7,5851.7, These are I'm basing these on.
5851.7,5857.7, Some of the things that neurologists all of her sex is cited among people with the severe um sort of
5857.7,5861.7, either like post and stuff alightess and other uh
5861.7,5863.7, That's what you're saying about me.
5863.7,5864.7, Yeah.
5864.7,5865.7, Yeah.
5865.7,5867.7, I'm shit.
5867.7,5869.7," Well, I do that anyway though."

5873.7,5875.7, So some is there something going on?
5875.7,5877.7, I'm low energy this week.
5877.7,5878.7, I'm really tired.
5879.7,5880.7, Are you?
5880.7,5883.7, You had one of those uh sour tongue tinglers stuck in his teeth the whole time.
5883.7,5884.7, Just trying to extract it.
5884.7,5886.7, And what's been why you've particularly tired this week.
5886.7,5888.7, I think you want to share with us.

5905.7,5906.7, People are going to be up reading the news.
5907.7,5909.7, That is an amazing pro-crastination.
5909.7,5913.7, Is it a game that they have like a huge uh European audience?
5913.7,5914.7, Maybe so.
5914.7,5917.7," Oh, it was an intendil event and they were."
5917.7,5918.7, It's called a big item bargo.

6000.7,6006.7, And so what you're about to hear is an opera.
6006.7,6008.7, A piece of an opera.
6008.7,6012.7, Post by fans of the game Final Fantasy 7.
6012.7,6016.7, What you're about to hear is not intended to be funny.
6016.7,6018.7, You're not supposed to laugh at it.
6018.7,6019.7, It was made.
6020.7,6021.7, It all seriousness.
