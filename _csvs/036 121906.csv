0.0,12.0," Hello and welcome to the GFW Radio podcast. This is the podcast for December 19th, 2006. This is our last podcast of the year."
12.0,24.0, And we have a lot to talk about and we may in fact even have special guests later on. We don't know if they're actually going to call or not that's part of today's suspenseful mystery.
24.0,35.0, Well they call in or not. We do have also we're going to reveal a game here on the podcast in just one minute I think.
35.0,41.0, Sean Elliott went up to Val Software to see a new game and he is actually for you talk about it.
41.0,53.0, I do have to say this for one second before we start that I'm really just sick of the like the broken down like unorganized equipment and all the crap that we have to deal with here.
53.0,56.0, So frustrating. It's like a 20 minutes just to get started here.
56.0,58.0, That's we couldn't find a headset.
58.0,64.0," Actually, we're now I'm sitting in a chair that's like a foot off the ground. I'm like a freaking midget."
64.0,68.0, We need more money for equipment.
68.0,70.0, True. Spending on video cards.
70.0,72.0, It's like a Wayne's World set up here.
72.0,74.0, We have to get in the line.
74.0,77.0, It's like a work for like multi million dollar corporate.
77.0,79.0, So it's a lot or two.
79.0,83.0," You know, it's kind of sad. I know it was all psyches. We were going to start off this podcast with the Rocky Balbo with theme."
83.0,86.0," We're going to come and I came down on a great mood. Yeah, we are going to do a pop."
86.0,87.0, Pop.
91.0,94.0," I don't know about you guys, but I'm psyched for Rocky Balbo."
94.0,95.0, I'm there. Hell no.
95.0,97.0, You got nothing to prove.
97.0,99.0, I swear this one's going to be good.
99.0,102.0, Rocky Jerry Attric is going to die.
102.0,104.0, Is he going to die this time?
104.0,106.0," Yeah, I think that's number seven."
106.0,107.0, That's the big.
107.0,108.0, Rocky dies.
108.0,109.0, Okay.
109.0,110.0, Enough of that.
110.0,115.0," Like I said, Sean Ellie just got back from Valve software yesterday."
115.0,119.0, And he got scooped on a new game being developed internally.
119.0,121.0, And it sounds great to me.
121.0,123.0, It sounds very dead rising issue.
123.0,126.0, So we need a little bit of a hand zone scoop sticker.
126.0,127.0," Oh, we need a little bit of a scoop sticker."
127.0,130.0," Yeah, we need a scoop sound effect."
130.0,132.0, So now GFW radio scoop.
132.0,133.0, Barrow.
134.0,138.0," Take it away, Sean."
138.0,141.0, Now I'm going to have performance anxiety.
141.0,144.0," Okay, so, uh, brought to us by Turtle Head."
144.0,145.0, It's not to be.
145.0,153.0," I'm going to say, uh, by Turtle Rock, which I meant to say not to be confused with the turtle head."
153.0,159.0," Yeah, they're the crew that developed AI for conditions zero, counter strike conditions zero."
159.0,163.0, And then also the counter strike Xbox version.
163.0,168.0," And they're working over the past, you know, three years and just seriously ramping up an"
168.0,172.0, development like about a year and a half ago on a game called Left for Dead.
172.0,177.0, And that's not to be confused with the two pox on because the four is a numerical four.
177.0,180.0, Inspired live thru or right.
180.0,183.0," So yeah, so first, yeah, you know, you hear about it and like, okay, so great."
183.0,185.0," What's this, right?"
185.0,188.0," And essentially, it's a human's versus zombie game."
188.0,190.0, But with the twist.
190.0,191.0, Okay.
191.0,195.0," So essentially what it is, is you have four players and it's a cooperative game."
195.0,200.0," You're all in the same team, your survivors and outbreakers, you know, an infestation, the traditional sort of thing."
200.0,203.0," It's up, it's the sort of the 28 days later."
203.0,204.0, Yeah.
204.0,205.0, Yeah.
205.0,206.0, And we're getting the number right.
206.0,207.0, It's not like 24 and a half.
207.0,208.0," Yeah, it's the 28 days later."
208.0,210.0," It's the, I think the fast moving."
210.0,211.0, Right.
211.0,215.0," So it's that breed of fast moving monstrosities with, uh,"
215.0,223.0," and then another four players if they choose can play what are called, you know, boss infected, which are, you know, specialized versions and think of,"
223.0,224.0, and rest in evil series.
224.0,231.0," You've got the lickers and the tyrants and everything else outside of the usual, like shambling, you know, uh, decaying guys."
231.0,234.0," And so, why should I start off?"
234.0,238.0, So that you're playing basically as your form and team and you're cooperative.
238.0,244.0," You're splitting, you know, weapons and ammo and everything, of course, you know, resources are, are, are rare,"
244.0,247.0," but I mean, you've got enough to do what you need to do and you've got a whole lot of shooting to do."
247.0,250.0, So it's a lot of survival horror multiplayer.
250.0,251.0, Yeah.
251.0,261.0," But if you think of the pacing of counter strike and, uh, but with, like I said, um, the enemies are really fast and they're far more numerous than anything I've ever seen using the source engine."
261.0,264.0," So, you know, I'm used to, you play, you play half life two and you're used to a zombie encounter."
264.0,266.0," You go into a room, you suspect something's in there."
266.0,270.0," You see four, maybe five, and episode one during the elevator sequence."
270.0,275.0, They throw them at you in waves and you maybe get like what eight on screen at a time or something ten.
275.0,280.0," So in this game, you can have, I mean, even if it's 20, I didn't get an exact count."
280.0,287.0," It seems like there's 40 or something coming at you and they're just going nuts running, jumping over things, flying at you."
287.0,294.0," And, um, while a lot of people, you know, some people are critical of whatever, you know, I didn't play a condition zero with their critical of AI bots in there."
294.0,297.0," But in this case, the difference is that there's zombies."
297.0,299.0, And so all they really need to do is get you.
299.0,303.0, They just need to be aggressive and persistent and smart enough to navigate the environment.
303.0,311.0," They don't need to necessarily flank you or this or that, you know, as long as they're just ruthlessly trying to get at you in any way possible."
311.0,314.0, Zombies are just being aren't known for their flanking.
314.0,315.0," Right, exactly."
315.0,317.0, It's not one of their big texts.
317.0,320.0," So, I mean, so here's an example of like, what, what could happen?"
320.0,323.0," Say, you're, you know, you're in this broken-out train yard or something."
323.0,332.0," And you find ways and you get up on the cars and you're like, all right, let's just sit up here and you know, blast them as they're crowing around and maybe some of my teammates are stuck down there and you're trying to cover them when you're up top."
332.0,345.0," And soon enough, I mean, they're flying and they're, you know, running under the cars and they're flying ways to climb up top and they're, you turn around and there's a whole train of coming up because they found a way to get up the train car, you know, there's all line up and running at you and just moan them down."
345.0,352.0," It looks great. I mean, they'll be running at you full speed and you stop and shoot them at animation and they'll just sort of like collapse at your feet or fall off the sides of the car."
352.0,356.0," And so wait, is it like, is it, it's cooperative, right?"
356.0,361.0," But it's cooperative and that there's, you know, the four of you playing the human survivor team are all working together."
361.0,367.0," You can help and heal one another. So say for example, like, all this continuum, illustrate a sample scenario."
367.0,373.0," So, so, say them up on the train car, you know, trying to cover two of my guys down below with another friend up on top of the car."
373.0,376.0, And then it turns out that the zombies are getting up on the car with us.
376.0,379.0, We clear them out and then maybe one guy gets taken down.
379.0,385.0," And when you get taken down, you're still alive at first and you could still shoot, but you're like laying on the ground and they're trying to come and eat on you."
385.0,390.0, And you have a certain amount of time when you're still trying to shoot them off of you and your friend has to come and pick you up.
390.0,396.0," But while you're picking so and up, you're also vulnerable. And then that's when the rat, the, the boss infected stuff come in."
396.0,401.0," So say for example, if you were what they call hunter and one of your moves is this lunch lunch attack."
401.0,404.0, And it's almost like the way that the hidden operates in the hidden model.
404.0,413.0," You can, you can lunch really quickly, but what happens here is if you hit someone with the attack, you'll then pull them to the ground and you'll be holding them in a chokehold and just tearing the crap out of them."
413.0,418.0," And then another one of the survivors has to kick him, you know, mail-am or shoot them off of you."
418.0,425.0," So then you can have these scenarios where it just rapidly, you know, it rapidly escalates and you just lose complete control of things."
425.0,427.0, You have one guy go down. Another guy tries to help him.
427.0,434.0," A hundred jumps on him is at his throat now. So you got to clear all the rest of the waves is on these, you know, they're coming at you off."
434.0,440.0," Get him off him. Pick him up. You say for example, if you're, you're fighting on a ledge or something on a roof."
440.0,445.0," If one of you falls off, which I found because I'm like, hey, let's see what the fall damage isn't this game. I'm going to jump down."
445.0,446.0, Yeah.
446.0,449.0, And instead what happens is you end up slipping over the side and you hold the edge.
449.0,455.0," But instead of pumping the button to get back up, you have to have someone help you and give you the classic like cliffhanger like saving hands."
455.0,460.0," So I'm sitting there at one point, you know, hanging off the side like yellow and there come, come grab me."
460.0,463.0," But the guy can't because he's fighting the guys, the enemies are still attacking us."
463.0,466.0, So he can't turn his back to them and pull me up right away.
466.0,468.0, And let's say your guy dies.
468.0,471.0," Is your old health, can you like, is he, do you turn into his ambie?"
471.0,478.0," You don't. So here's what happens when you get to the complete, you know, fatal stage, you know, where you're just absolutely killed."
478.0,483.0," What happens then is that they're, the campaign is set up so that they sort of like,"
483.0,486.0, organically allow you back into the game.
486.0,490.0, Instead of spawning you back at the beginning of the level and having you catch up or instead of making it.
490.0,494.0," So you can just keep responding and you basically can't lose because of that, you know,"
494.0,496.0, what happens is you're out and you have to wait.
496.0,501.0," But as the players progress, they might find some closet or something where they stuffed a bunch of bodies and they can pull you out of there later."
501.0,506.0," And then that way bring you back, but you come back with like low health and just your pistol or something."
506.0,509.0, So is this actually like a linear campaign with levels?
509.0,510.0, It is.
510.0,511.0, Yes. So when you're campaign with low level.
511.0,513.0, Who is dead rising man? This is this is it.
513.0,515.0, Right. So so.
515.0,523.0," So on the other side. So what that means is that if you're playing on the infected side, you are always going to be an infected and you choose between four types."
523.0,528.0, So one I mentioned was a hunter and he's capable. He can also he has stealth abilities.
528.0,533.0," So he can, you know, go, if you're, if your back is against the wall and you stay still, you just go invisible, eventually."
533.0,536.0, But any movement will bring you back into visibility.
536.0,540.0," He can also leap and he can do like triangle jumps, you know, like if you get between two buildings."
540.0,544.0," And sort of like, you know, Mario style, you hit one building hit the really high."
544.0,546.0, And then you get a bunch of original stuff right.
546.0,550.0, And we're of course now the survivors can get and leap down on them.
550.0,552.0, Another is called the Smoker.
552.0,560.0," And when it gets hit a bunch, it sort of throws out this noxious like tear gas thing that just completely obscures the area."
560.0,563.0, And line of sights really important. So it's really obnoxious.
563.0,566.0, So you don't want this thing thrown out the smoke. You want to kill them quick.
566.0,570.0," Because I mean, all of a sudden you're looking at an opaque wall of smoke."
570.0,575.0," And then like 30 zombies come rushing right through it all of a sudden, you know, and he's a bomber."
575.0,580.0, His other thing is he's got a 40 foot long tongue with which he can grab you.
580.0,584.0," Yeah, and that's right ladies. He's got the jeans in his attack."
584.0,593.0," So yeah, you hit you with that tongue and you know, pull you toardom and other teammates again have to shoot him to stop him or what's what's better is like he could be above you or a railing."
593.0,598.0, And this tongue kind of hangs over the guardrail grabs you and like basically acts as a news.
598.0,600.0, That's how big a show.
600.0,602.0, It's got that big.
602.0,603.0, How does he wrap up?
603.0,605.0, I don't know where the scene of it.
605.0,607.0, It's okay.
607.0,609.0, It's man.
609.0,613.0," You know, the one that you're describing like I've played so many zombies games over the years."
613.0,619.0," The one thing I always wished for is that kind of multiplayer killed a guy mode where like, you know, you start off with even teams and then the team has become unbalanced."
619.0,620.0, Right.
620.0,630.0, There are there are several source mods that play that way zombies zombie strike is one that basically we're basically just seeing that inside of a game made specifically about zombies.
630.0,632.0, That'd be like having you switch over.
632.0,633.0, Yeah.
633.0,640.0," So how does this, I mean, I know the game plays totally different, but do you feel like this holds any comparison whatsoever to denorizing?"
640.0,642.0, Which is obviously a dead right.
642.0,643.0, Yeah.
643.0,644.0," Oh, you have it."
644.0,645.0, No.
645.0,646.0, Okay.
646.0,647.0," Well, it's probably an apples and oranges comparison."
647.0,648.0, Yeah.
648.0,655.0," I first thought of skeptical because you're like, okay, really it's going to be just like a smash TV game where you just blast stuff that appears."
655.0,656.0, Right.
656.0,658.0, But I was really it's actually it's scary.
658.0,661.0," It holds the vibe together and constantly you're like, oh crap."
661.0,664.0," And you feel like, you know, things are falling apart and you're scared."
664.0,670.0," And another thing that's great about it is that the AI, I mean, I think it's even though it is a campaign."
670.0,672.0, It's ultimately like replayable.
672.0,676.0," I mean, I guess it's like a series of like six campaigns in a package and I played one of those like three."
676.0,684.0," Three times from different characters positions, but instead of saying like, you know, you open the store and you're going to spawn some."
684.0,687.0, You're going to trigger zombie attack here. That is like always changing.
687.0,693.0," It's completely, I mean, I don't know like if if it's entirely random or they have like a set number if they have 10 variations."
693.0,698.0," And then they recombine those for like approaching an infinite, you know, variety of recommendations."
698.0,705.0," But because of it, you don't get that like mad dog, make crease shit where you're like, okay, here's the dude that's up here on the band."
705.0,711.0," Just hit up here on the band. It's starting to shoot them over into the horse drop, you know, okay, don't don't don't talk shit about mad dog McCree."
711.0,714.0, I drop mad coin on that on the arcade.
714.0,717.0, So you knew that the dude was going to appear on that band.
717.0,718.0, It's all the horse drop.
718.0,724.0," It was a bit of it was worth it though to see that old, old coat from the mind. Just go by cracking."
724.0,729.0," So they got, the guys are always coming from different areas and they can come behind you too."
729.0,734.0," So I mean, as your, your, your different entrances and when you're playing from the infected side,"
734.0,749.0," you also have different level of pathing to some degree. You can go through different different routes and stuff. So you're always, you want someone to hold up the rear and look back and all the sudden he's like, you know, guys, guys, guys are so man, guys coming."
749.0,755.0, So let me cover the other two boss infected quick because they're all fine.
755.0,760.0," Okay, the other is a boomer and it's just this grotesque morbidly obese sort of like,"
760.0,763.0," you know, we're going to be a little bit more involved."
763.0,765.0, So we're going to be a bit more involved.
765.0,769.0," Yeah, well, that game's journalist and like more published guests, you know,"
769.0,772.0, okay.
772.0,773.0," Obija, this is up his mail."
773.0,775.0, So tremendous.
775.0,779.0," So, it's just this big, you know, fat, post covered piece of crap and he projectile,"
779.0,784.0," vomit's a, and it, it spews out like a fire hose so you can stray with this crap."
784.0,786.0," You know, you can work at games."
787.0,788.0, I'm just kidding.
788.0,789.0," Oh, shit."
789.0,792.0, That was a game stop it for us.
792.0,793.0, You're going there.
793.0,795.0," Yeah, I love the games."
795.0,797.0, I had to pick someone.
797.0,798.0, All right.
798.0,800.0," I was going to say, yeah, I was actually going to say, game stop."
800.0,801.0," Yeah, go ahead."
801.0,803.0," So this guy, you just got a neck beard."
803.0,804.0, Yeah.
804.0,807.0, He has a clean on dictionary in his hand or a chance shirt on.
807.0,809.0," And, you know, I actually like,"
809.0,811.0," Oh, one, one, one."
811.0,813.0," Okay, so matching out like,"
814.0,818.0," Well, you know, the metal slug series, this is all, you know, when you turn into one and you do that big giant projectile vomit thing,"
818.0,822.0," it's kind of like that, but you could stray with it and what happens is, wow, hit someone with it."
822.0,823.0," They, they become marked."
823.0,824.0, It's a fair amount type thing.
824.0,828.0, So we can call that rotten bile attracts all the NPC zombies.
828.0,830.0," So all of a sudden, you get hit with that."
830.0,834.0," And part of the trick for playing that boss infected is, you're really weak."
834.0,835.0," You know, it's easy to get killed."
835.0,837.0," They shoot you a bunch, I mean, not a bunch."
837.0,838.0, They shoot you a considerable amount.
838.0,839.0, You're gone.
839.0,840.0, So you want to pray on the week.
840.0,846.0," You find the guy that's limping, you know, or one of the stragglers in the back that they weren't paying attention to and you hit him with it."
846.0,847.0, And then vomit on.
847.0,849.0," And suddenly, yeah, you just, you've gone, hands in salt to enter."
849.0,851.0," And you're not going to, you guys, it's, it's, it's just a,"
851.0,853.0, at least we go back for a second.
853.0,854.0, So there's occasional damage.
854.0,857.0," So like, your guys are limping if they're like, I don't know if it's location."
857.0,858.0, I think it's more over time.
858.0,862.0, You lose a percentage of your health and you start slow down and you're visible like hurt.
862.0,863.0, Okay.
863.0,865.0, And then you have to worry that someone's going to vomit on you.
865.0,866.0, Right.
866.0,867.0," And then once you vomit on, it says,"
868.0,869.0, Right.
869.0,874.0," And then say, you know, 20 regular zombies come rushing out of it full speed and they're already hurt."
874.0,877.0," And every time they start wailing on, you get points for that too."
877.0,880.0," If you play to the boomer and so your points, which is like,"
880.0,883.0," I bet it's like, you, when you get what the points,"
883.0,887.0," shitty casino, you just get right now they're deciding so far."
887.0,889.0," They've got, you know, like, you know,"
889.0,891.0," they rank you when you get all these different,"
891.0,893.0, those these different badges and awards every time.
893.0,894.0, But she's there to campaign.
894.0,895.0, And then she's there to do more fun.
895.0,896.0, Right.
896.0,905.0," So it's the achievement model and they're debating on whether or not there will be sort of a material or in this case of virtual reward such as, you know, guns and weapons and things like that to do next."
905.0,906.0, So it's so sweet.
906.0,911.0, But so the other thing about the boomer is that he will explode after being shot.
911.0,912.0, He's like a big giant bomb.
912.0,914.0," But she used that to your advantage when you're him by,"
914.0,917.0, because you can run up and swap the hell out of them.
917.0,920.0, And all they can do is they have to mail you to push you back.
920.0,921.0, And you can't even shoot.
921.0,923.0," But so like what I would do is, you know,"
923.0,925.0," I'd find a place where I'm sort of,"
925.0,932.0, there's a hole in the roof or something and I wait for him all and I just drop down in the middle of it and they freak because they just think it's a zombie and shoot and you blow up and it hurts everyone.
932.0,933.0," Oh, he was a free day."
933.0,934.0, Right.
934.0,935.0, Yeah.
935.0,936.0," He's just got to tell you like, just a projectile."
936.0,938.0," You're committing like, Kamakaz."
938.0,939.0," You're a comic-class, you're a comic-class, you're a comic-class."
939.0,941.0, This is an oil drug.
942.0,943.0," Yeah, he was like, you know, oil drug."
943.0,946.0, He's a flame barrel of the chips.
946.0,947.0, He's that.
947.0,951.0, And then another one is called just the tank.
951.0,953.0," I mean, some of these names are changing."
953.0,955.0, It was listed as the Hulk and the Hulk and the game.
955.0,957.0," And clearly, there's going to be some copyright issues there."
957.0,961.0, But this giant guy at heat comes in only once in a while.
961.0,963.0," And if you're in the infected boss infected spawn pool,"
963.0,965.0, you might get chosen so you get to be him.
965.0,967.0, Because they don't want these guys are so powerful.
967.0,969.0, They don't want to build enough in the game.
969.0,970.0, Yeah.
970.0,975.0, And this guy's great because you could just pick up cars and anything in the environment
975.0,978.0, and just stuff that no one can move and just throw it at guys.
978.0,980.0, Smack him across the area.
980.0,981.0, That's not one that was great.
981.0,985.0," A guy got knocked down and he's laying on his back, waiting to get picked up and he's like"
985.0,988.0, shooting with two twin glocks at the thing.
988.0,991.0," And then he hit some again and the guys flying through the air, like shooting."
991.0,993.0, It's like you're broken legs.
993.0,994.0, It's a wall.
994.0,996.0, And then a lot of environmental stuff.
996.0,999.0," So you know, there's like girders and stuff underneath you."
999.0,1001.0, You can hit him and you're whatever you're standing on.
1001.0,1004.0, We'll just collapse and you'll fall down to where he's at.
1004.0,1005.0, And that's just because we're just big.
1005.0,1007.0, So that requires four other players.
1007.0,1008.0," I mean, it's four people call it."
1008.0,1009.0, It could be none if you want.
1009.0,1010.0, Okay.
1010.0,1011.0, You could set it as many ways as you want.
1011.0,1014.0, You can have bots as your allies on the survivors.
1014.0,1015.0, Save.
1015.0,1016.0, It's just you and a friend and you want two bots.
1016.0,1017.0, Okay.
1017.0,1019.0, And you want to fight nothing but bots.
1019.0,1021.0, They'll still spawn in AI controlled.
1021.0,1022.0, Boss infected.
1022.0,1023.0, Okay.
1023.0,1024.0, Okay.
1025.0,1030.0," And some of it's fun with with humans, of course, because a lot of, you know, some of the guys there, what's his air,"
1030.0,1035.0," Well, Paul was doing a lot of annoying hit and run tactics of smoke or he knew he didn't want to like fight us."
1035.0,1037.0," So he would basically amounted griefing, you know,"
1037.0,1038.0, That's awesome.
1038.0,1042.0," But in a way, he just comes out and, you know, build trip a bunch of smoke and then go hide again,"
1042.0,1047.0," somewhere and pop out behind you and, you know, grab you with this tongue and hit over the rail."
1047.0,1048.0," So basically he's like, off."
1048.0,1050.0," So in the classical thing, he's like a support role."
1050.0,1051.0, Right.
1051.0,1052.0, Go in.
1052.0,1053.0, And then run back.
1053.0,1054.0, Right.
1054.0,1055.0," So he's kind of like the engineer, I guess."
1055.0,1056.0, Yeah.
1056.0,1058.0, So that that was one concern I have.
1058.0,1061.0," And that they're going to have to address is that when you are on the infected side, it's,"
1061.0,1062.0," it's of course,"
1062.0,1067.0," stack against you because the guys ultimately are supposed to get through the level, you know,"
1067.0,1068.0, Right.
1068.0,1071.0, And there's like they're depending on how long you survive each time you spawn in.
1071.0,1075.0," And there can be a considerable weight, you know, like up to like 30 seconds."
1075.0,1078.0," And I mean, they need to, I mean, they've considered letting you in between in,"
1078.0,1081.0," in between in intervals, play is like one of the regular time."
1081.0,1087.0," It doesn't zombies or whatever, but I still think they need to do unless, unless you ramp up the difficulty."
1087.0,1088.0, And it does get hard.
1088.0,1089.0, There's four difficulty levels.
1089.0,1093.0," And then when the survivors are playing on like medium and hard, it gets tough for them."
1093.0,1098.0," Because there's some other things that you can't play call witches and stuff too, and they're just nasty."
1098.0,1100.0, And then it then it works out better.
1100.0,1103.0," But like on the easier modes, it's not as fun."
1103.0,1107.0, I found a play the infected yet because it's easy to get torn up.
1107.0,1110.0, So it's just a full on like major valve release.
1110.0,1115.0," I mean, it'll be about like, it'll be like counter strike or something worth 29.99."
1115.0,1117.0, And they're really expecting the sooner and later.
1117.0,1119.0, They're really hoping to hit a march or something.
1119.0,1121.0, It's just like under the radar.
1121.0,1122.0, Right.
1122.0,1124.0," I mean, they really didn't make a big deal about this ahead of time."
1124.0,1125.0, Right.
1125.0,1127.0, I actually want to appreciate that more.
1127.0,1131.0, I actually appreciate them doing that kind of stuff more as opposed to like build up the hype.
1131.0,1133.0," And then two years later, you're still waiting for the damn game."
1133.0,1135.0," Well, it's just been an interesting year with like the ship."
1135.0,1138.0," I mean, they just like keep the keep kind of cranking out these."
1138.0,1140.0," I mean, I guess the ship doesn't compare."
1140.0,1142.0, That was the ship wasn't by them.
1142.0,1143.0, Right.
1143.0,1144.0, That was that was so amusing there.
1144.0,1145.0, Right.
1145.0,1146.0, So that was a mod.
1146.0,1147.0, But the turtle was doing something.
1147.0,1148.0, It started.
1148.0,1150.0," After they were working on conditions, you know, the turtle rock guys,"
1150.0,1153.0," we, you know, in a house, I think with with the valve."
1153.0,1154.0, So it makes sense.
1154.0,1157.0," And they wanted they wanted a, you know, they had straight multiplayer games,"
1157.0,1160.0," you know, valve did data feed counter strike and stuff."
1160.0,1163.0, The extreme single player and they wanted a kind of cooperative experience to go
1163.0,1164.0, between there.
1164.0,1166.0, And I think this is really the right game.
1166.0,1169.0, And maybe the timing is almost almost awful.
1169.0,1171.0, A little bit and that it could have come out sooner.
1171.0,1178.0, But because one half life two came out a huge number of mods had to do with essentially this type of gameplay.
1178.0,1182.0," Fending off on slots of ant lions, you know, with two people,"
1182.0,1183.0, the zombie strike mods.
1183.0,1184.0, I was talking about counter strike.
1184.0,1186.0, So the demand is definitely there.
1186.0,1187.0, People want to do it.
1187.0,1188.0, Now here's a version where right.
1188.0,1189.0, And that too.
1189.0,1192.0," And there's no good shooters because I was like, this stuff's already been done by your fans."
1192.0,1193.0, Yeah.
1193.0,1198.0, But you could definitely see the first valves like own code of polish on this and it's making a big difference.
1198.0,1200.0," I mean, you know what, it's, you know what, I got to tell you how exciting."
1200.0,1205.0," Well, you know what, it's, well, one, the game play sounds really cool and also it's freaking zombies."
1205.0,1206.0," You know what, I'm, right."
1206.0,1209.0," I think, they could, they could have a certain of box with a zombie on the cover."
1209.0,1210.0, I'm going to buy the box.
1210.0,1212.0," Okay, maybe not maybe not."
1212.0,1213.0, Maybe not.
1213.0,1214.0, Damn.
1214.0,1217.0," So, you guys don't want to do not let, I was, I'll be exact."
1217.0,1218.0, I'll actually not.
1218.0,1220.0, So we know it to get there and for Christmas.
1221.0,1223.0, I already got a couple of those waiting under the tree.
1223.0,1239.0," So that, one last thing about it, I'll say is like, there's, there's a number of cool scenarios where, you know, you take turns going up like an, an elevator that's on the outside of a building or something or like you get to, you work your way to a rooftop where you're going to get extracted by a helicopter."
1239.0,1241.0, But then you have to wait for the helicopter.
1241.0,1243.0," Very, very resin, you bullish and you're up there."
1243.0,1249.0," Moined down, you know, hordes and hordes of guys that they're attacking and some of, you know, the hunters are jumping, they can jump up to the roofs with you."
1249.0,1253.0, And they're trying to knock you off like very much using a melee to push you off.
1253.0,1264.0," And, you know, the tanks are coming in and knocking stuff down eventually getting the helicopter and like, you know, you're circling around and using the chain guns on all the zombies as you're taking off and it was very fun."
1264.0,1266.0, I was very excited by it.
1266.0,1267.0," Actually, I got to get some time playing."
1267.0,1272.0," I got to ask me, when you were talking to the team working on it, were there any guys that came, that had come in as the former modders, just had a curiosity?"
1272.0,1273.0, I didn't hear about it.
1273.0,1280.0," It sounded like it was really a small crew and it was like all of Turtle Rock from as, you know, they were when they put together conditions zero."
1280.0,1289.0," The only reason I asked is because this sound, obviously, it's not as ambitious as this, but a year ago at IGF, I saw one of the, one of the contestants and I think mod winners."
1289.0,1292.0," These guys, I think I could swear the game was called the Awakening."
1292.0,1294.0, It's a UT 2004 mod.
1294.0,1295.0, It did basically is what you describe.
1295.0,1296.0, Right.
1296.0,1298.0," Team base survival horrors, zombies versus humans."
1298.0,1299.0, Cool.
1299.0,1310.0," I'm just certain role, but I mean, like, so I guess I'm just saying it's out and out there, if you do a look up for it, you know, maybe it's just two different teams working on a similar, but one of those things were a lot of the two Capote movie."
1310.0,1311.0, Right.
1311.0,1316.0," Well, exactly. I think it's one of those things where like everyone wanted to do like the quintessential, nice Capote river."
1316.0,1320.0," Or anything, do you think impact in Armageddon, same guy or exactly?"
1320.0,1321.0, Answer the bug.
1321.0,1323.0," Yeah, there you go."
1323.0,1325.0, I'm just taking a high brow answer.
1325.0,1327.0, Find the info and go read the new sharks.
1327.0,1330.0, Yeah.
1330.0,1335.0," Anyway, I was going to say, well, that sounds, that sounds great, Sean."
1335.0,1336.0, Thanks for the scoop.
1336.0,1337.0," Yeah, guys."
1337.0,1340.0," And now, and now the outro for the scoop music."
1340.0,1341.0," Oh, I'll show up."
1341.0,1342.0, I'll show up.
1342.0,1343.0, I'll show up.
1343.0,1344.0, We're going to take a break.
1344.0,1351.0," We're going to see if our collars are calling in, or if they're snubbing us, maybe they're calling in to somebody else's podcast."
1351.0,1353.0, He's long so it's not the fucking retronauts.
1353.0,1355.0, Okay.
1355.0,1359.0, There's talk about the original command of cocker.
1359.0,1361.0, Okay.
1361.0,1362.0, We'll be right back.
1362.0,1364.0, Wasn't from Japan to start going to be on retronauts.
1369.0,1371.0," Oh, hello. I didn't see there."
1371.0,1378.0," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM Live, the weekly podcast from the editors of a lecturing giving monthly, along with the wonderful sounds of."

1422.0,1424.0, Welcome back.
1424.0,1428.0, We did in fact get our calling folks here.
1428.0,1440.0," We are now on the line with Mike Verdou, the executive producer of command and conquer three tibirium wars and Jason Bender, the lead designer of tibirium wars."
1440.0,1441.0," Hello, gentlemen."
1441.0,1448.0," We just, I think it went on the new stand today, in fact."
1448.0,1449.0," No, at least yesterday."
1449.0,1451.0," No, I saw the yesterday."
1451.0,1455.0," Okay, are the second glorious issue or is the third glorious issue?"
1455.0,1457.0," Second, second, second, second."
1457.0,1465.0," The second issue of our relaunch game, sir windows magazine is on new stands with the new command and conquer game on it."
1465.0,1471.0," And so we brought these fine folks in here to talk about us, talk to us about the game."
1471.0,1478.0, And we have a page full of questions about three of which will probably get to in the time we have.
1478.0,1480.0," So Sean, true."
1480.0,1482.0, Elliott has been chomping at the bit to ask.
1483.0,1485.0, So asking of not just one right off the bat.
1485.0,1498.0, I just want to know if any similarities between tibirium wars and superman returns tibirium and a crypto night are entirely coincidental.
1498.0,1501.0," Yeah, that's not all right."
1501.0,1503.0, I was a little surprised.
1503.0,1511.0," So we've been working on this for a while and I was a little surprised when I went to see Superman, the movie, how much crypto night was in that movie."
1511.0,1521.0," It was like it was just funny because I've been working with Green Crystal, you know, had my head buried in it for months and then the next thing you know, he goes from man and just green crystal everywhere."
1521.0,1523.0, Which is very coincidental.
1523.0,1527.0," Yeah, we are looking at our the cover just now with all the with all the tibirium on it."
1527.0,1530.0," And we were like, oh yeah, this could have been the Superman cover."
1530.0,1533.0, Or the like cane and legs both are bald man.
1533.0,1535.0," Yeah, this is a total connection."
1535.0,1536.0," But as you guys know, I mean,"
1536.0,1539.0," Griffin, I had tibirium both in and around for a long time."
1539.0,1540.0, Yes.
1540.0,1541.0, Yes.
1541.0,1544.0," You know, it still happens that we ended up lining up at the same time."
1544.0,1551.0, This is a fissitious question because I know I had actually heard the plot of tibirium wars in advance of plot for superman returns and then it was like as you said.
1551.0,1555.0," So the not only is it everywhere, but yeah, it's just taken over the entire planet."
1555.0,1560.0," Well, tibirium was kind of going that way for a long time in the previous games too, so it wasn't like."
1560.0,1561.0," I know it, man."
1561.0,1563.0, I just had a chance.
1563.0,1566.0, So before the spin spirals out of control.
1566.0,1569.0, Let's keep it game centric.
1569.0,1573.0, I'm sure most of our listeners know this franchise.
1573.0,1575.0," If you don't, this is a command of cockers."
1575.0,1581.0, One of the the seminal real time strategy games going back to.
1581.0,1583.0, When did the first one come out?
1583.0,1585.0, I should have had these facts on my hands.
1585.0,1589.0," Well, the first CNC was 96."
1590.0,1591.0, 95 95.
1591.0,1592.0," Okay, I was close."
1592.0,1593.0, I was close.
1593.0,1598.0, And now you're back after a fairly long hiatus.
1598.0,1602.0, And there's just a lot of questions I have.
1602.0,1606.0," In regards to that, I guess the first one being right now."
1606.0,1612.0, We're we're really seeing a pretty cool renaissance of strategy games of RTS as like.
1613.0,1615.0, Relics company heroes.
1615.0,1617.0, EAs on battle for middle or two.
1617.0,1619.0, There's been some really great ones this year.
1619.0,1622.0, And is that a good thing for you guys?
1622.0,1624.0, Do you feel.
1624.0,1629.0, You're entering a research market or do you feel that.
1629.0,1634.0," I mean, is a competition a good thing or you worried about your game stacking up or"
1634.0,1636.0, you confident or what.
1636.0,1641.0," No, that's a strategy game or seeing the variety of games out there is."
1641.0,1647.0, It's really hardening and and looking at the sales data that there they're actually doing well.
1647.0,1649.0," So I mean, it seems like the whole market is coming back."
1649.0,1652.0," It is kind of a golden age, especially for RTS."
1652.0,1662.0, And it's it's cool because each of the games that are coming out have something that makes them sort of unique and special and occupy their own place.
1662.0,1667.0, And what seems to be a pretty healthy ecosystem of a real time strategy.
1668.0,1669.0, So I don't get the bad thing.
1669.0,1670.0, I think it's actually a good thing.
1670.0,1673.0, It shows there's a lot of life in in the market.
1673.0,1678.0, And if you're a fan like like I am like most of the people on the team are.
1678.0,1681.0, It's it's a great thing.
1681.0,1696.0," Certainly, since he three, I think offers a lot of value in the in the main features that that that we have everything from the the pace of the gameplay, which is a was which is very fast."
1696.0,1698.0, It has a unique feel to it.
1698.0,1709.0," To the the richness and depth of the story, which I think is very unique in the market we have now and the way we tell the story and that's some of the really cool things we're doing with multiplayer."
1709.0,1715.0, So I do think we're offering interesting things to the mix and it's a good thing to you.
1715.0,1717.0," Yeah, I mean, so definitely the gamer."
1717.0,1718.0, I love it.
1718.0,1721.0, It's still cool being able to have just a variety of different things to play.
1721.0,1724.0," I mean, for a long time first person shooters have been getting pretty diverse."
1724.0,1726.0, It's nice to see our yeses.
1726.0,1732.0," You know, having both the volume and diversity at the same time for once because we tend to have one or the other."
1732.0,1737.0, So now we have a lot of really interesting games out there of pretty significantly different styles.
1737.0,1744.0, The cool thing about working on a command and conquer is that I've been around for a long time and it has definitely its own style.
1744.0,1752.0," And so it's it's a lot of fun to be able to work on one of the stands out and be able to do something that's really fast, pay, clean and as Mike was saying,"
1752.0,1755.0," I mean, it's cool to be able to actually have a story because a lot of them out there."
1755.0,1757.0," I mean, they don't necessarily have that."
1757.0,1764.0," So we're able to have a really cool multiplayer aspect, a really cool single player with a story and a franchise that people know and love."
1764.0,1768.0," It's like, I mean, that's pretty awesome to be working on that."
1768.0,1769.0," Yeah, the story."
1769.0,1770.0, Go ahead.
1770.0,1771.0," Oh, no, go ahead."
1771.0,1781.0," Well, as I can ask you, the storytelling, the way you are doing it is definitely unique because of, I mean, the obvious thing is the full motion video you're doing with with some fairly famous people."
1781.0,1789.0, And it seems like it seems cool to me because obviously you have some big name or big name in the geek world stars.
1789.0,1791.0, You've got the the battle start galactic ababs.
1791.0,1802.0," You've got Josh Holloway from Lost, but it seems like such a like odd throwback to like a time that's been fairly discredited, but you know, in gaming."
1802.0,1804.0," I think they will never die, man."
1804.0,1805.0, Right.
1805.0,1807.0, So why did you guys choose to go this way?
1808.0,1820.0," Well, I think that if you know and love, see and see, you have this expectation that the stories are going to be told using that mix of live action and CG."
1820.0,1825.0, And I know it's for the three generations of CNC fans were working on a project.
1825.0,1830.0, It was almost a no brainer to bring back that way of telling the story.
1830.0,1835.0, And I know our community and our fans had that expectation as well.
1835.0,1846.0, Everybody has kind of a soft spot in their and their heart for the way the fiction was delivered and the early CNC games and we had to follow through on that and it felt that it.
1846.0,1851.0, It was something that we had to do and we really pleased with the way it came off.
1851.0,1856.0, I think that people are going to be excited to see the story come come to life and.
1856.0,1859.0, In the sequences that we have between missions.
1859.0,1862.0, So we're not going to go ahead.
1863.0,1869.0, Where the where the famous folks like Trisha Helfer where they good sports about doing all this or did or did it.
1869.0,1871.0, Like they were just you know.
1871.0,1874.0, Caching a check in between takes for battle struggle.
1874.0,1889.0, I'm not they were actually quite excited to to work on the project and in fact a number of them cited the script and the treatment that we sent them as as the reason they signed up to do this.
1889.0,1913.0, And they're it's an interesting world and the characters are interesting and it's not that often that you have a game story where characters really sort of learned and grow as the story progresses and there's sort of a couple of different layers operating and have something that feels like it has some real depth and and dimension and they really funk their teeth into that and had a had a great time with it.
1913.0,1916.0, Did you get to meet all of them.
1916.0,1920.0, Yeah fortunately that's why I did this.
1920.0,1926.0, So I mean that that was kind of the cool thing about you know I was I had no idea what to expect what I was meeting some of these people.
1926.0,1938.0, And so you know Trisha for one was she was such a great sport. She's having so much fun and the amazing part was that she was both having a great time and smiling constantly and just an amazing job.
1938.0,1941.0, I mean it was shocking. You know so we make games.
1941.0,1945.0, So being on a set with this kind of talent.
1945.0,1950.0, It's really inspiring because you don't realize just how awesome they really are.
1950.0,1957.0, It's like a salmon person and it's just as a electric in person as it is when you see them you know on screen the moment music and all the effects and all that.
1957.0,1961.0, So it was so cool seeing the real you know real talent.
1961.0,1964.0, Be able to be something and then have fun at the same time.
1965.0,1974.0, And what we're doing with the full motion video sequences is really it's a at the heart of what we're doing across the board with a product which is making something that feels very C and C.
1974.0,1978.0, You know with 27 million copies out there.
1978.0,1993.0, C and C is a very widely known and loved franchise and so there's a very high bar we have to be in terms of having people sort of come home and play a game that feels very much like the earlier games in the series.
1993.0,1999.0, And at the same time it has to be you know fresh and updated and feel like it's a state of the art 2007 RTS right so.
1999.0,2011.0, Being that balanced that that mix is something that we work hard on every day and you know delighted that the people who have played the game and the people who've seen the video sequences say yep this is a.
2011.0,2012.0, This is a.
2012.0,2013.0, This is a.
2013.0,2021.0, And you can give us this is probably going to be the first CNC game for a lot of gamers especially younger ones obviously.
2021.0,2023.0, Yeah and it's been a week.
2023.0,2030.0, I mean we we've kept that in mind for sure I mean we definitely aren't merely catering to people that know that know the fiction up to now and the story.
2030.0,2033.0, The story is really you know advanced beyond where it was before.
2033.0,2037.0, I mean and this isn't like the the inundation of Fnb from the 90s.
2037.0,2040.0, I mean it's not just another game of you know random cutscenes.
2041.0,2048.0, The gameplay has been brought forward I mean we've we've worked on multiplayer a lot on the single player campaign them you know we've done it.
2048.0,2053.0, We've put a lot of effort into making sure the missions are a lot of fun whether or not you played CNC before.
2053.0,2058.0, And you know and I'm hoping that the people that haven't played CNC before.
2058.0,2063.0, Well once they get the chance on this game will get it and we'll consider themselves fans just like people who play the first one.
2063.0,2079.0, Yeah super fast the fluid RTS gameplay is addictive and even people who yeah who who have never been exposed to RTS were able to get them in and playing with our with our new UI and and they have a blast.
2079.0,2088.0, We're actually really looking forward to the reaction from from people were we're drawing into the into the fold as well as people who are coming back.
2088.0,2097.0, How about the the Xbox 360 connection is it launching simultaneously first of all on on both platforms.
2097.0,2117.0, Do you know and we haven't we haven't really talked about a really time frame but gameplay wise I mean are are have you had to make concessions or changes to the PC gameplay to accommodate 360 controls or is it going to be the same experience that we would be used to with any RTS.
2118.0,2133.0, It's the same experience we're building on the foundation that we put in place with the battle for the two on the 360 which really showed that you can play a classic RTS game with a controller have it be a great experience.
2133.0,2147.0, It's using the controller actually brings some new things to the game like actually making use of the 3D space because with your finger on a on a stick it's just so easy to fly through the world and make it seem like a real 3D.
2147.0,2157.0, Would you actually recommend maybe that PC gamers play it with the next box 360 controller if they had one or would you still prefer a keyboard mouse.
2157.0,2172.0," I really come down to a matter of taste I mean personally I love my keyboard and very cool to play play with a controller and it's absolutely viable way to go I come down to a preference Jason, do you have thoughts on that."
2172.0,2182.0, I mean most so some of the most RTS gamers it's been a PC primary platform for so long that a lot of people just trained up on the mouse keyboard and so it tends to be more natural.
2182.0,2190.0, But what I found is shooters is that after a while when people start to play a certain genre on the console for a while that becomes.
2190.0,2197.0, You know they're primary way playing so anyone who is just just feels at home with a console controller in their hand would play that way.
2197.0,2203.0, But it really just is a matter of how experienced you are with one platform for the other right what if you've got a guy who's.
2203.0,2208.0, Who's using the controller and he's playing against somebody who's a total hot keyfee on the keyboard.
2208.0,2210.0, I mean doesn't that guy have a leg up.
2210.0,2222.0, So we yeah there's a number of people on the team who just play the game on the on the 360 and and it feels native to them and they're entering the challenge somebody on on the PC side.
2222.0,2240.0, So I mean they won't be able to play 360 against PC in 1033 that's probably a generation or two of games away but they are adamant that when the time finally comes for the showdown between the the console players.
2240.0,2242.0, There we go.
2242.0,2248.0, You have to stay face each other spit no one another across the same line for another year's yet.
2248.0,2251.0, I believe we put our fist up.
2251.0,2252.0, Victor.
2252.0,2257.0, I'm just going to be the ideal game to be able to do that kind of cross platform.
2257.0,2259.0, Well that are a match against.
2259.0,2263.0," Yeah, but you see it's probably a generation off you think."
2263.0,2265.0, Probably yeah.
2265.0,2266.0, Yeah.
2266.0,2271.0, Well there's nothing technically in the way it's just a matter of getting everything sort of synchronized.
2271.0,2279.0, And making sure everything works and you probably want to you know the simultaneously release product.
2279.0,2282.0," But yeah, it's the day is coming."
2282.0,2287.0, Whatever they're asked in that they came though like with the quick three on Dreamcast and.
2287.0,2290.0," Yeah, that worked out really well with the connection."
2290.0,2292.0," Okay, so how about the how about the third race now?"
2292.0,2300.0," We're sit we have on our cover we said, you know, new race revealed except we couldn't reveal their name."
2300.0,2302.0, Do they have one yet?
2302.0,2303.0, Chuck.
2303.0,2308.0, We are obviously aiming you are probably won't find out.
2308.0,2318.0, A lot more about where they came from and what they're all about other than what you can read about in the magazine and tell you actually play the game.
2318.0,2328.0, Their identity is very much tied into type area and there's a considerable amount of mystery and mythology that's built up around the alien race.
2328.0,2331.0," Okay, so no you're not telling us."
2331.0,2332.0," No, no, no."
2332.0,2335.0, You've been a translation.
2335.0,2343.0," Okay, I've been hogging the questions do you guys have any you want your dying to ask in the last minute."
2343.0,2344.0, Got one minute.
2344.0,2345.0, I'll be around there.
2345.0,2348.0," All right, I'll say I'll say the easy question for the one minute one."
2348.0,2355.0, So you guys obviously like you're kind of bringing back the the classic game like gameplay style of the CNC series and kind of refining.
2355.0,2359.0, You're talking more of a speed game and you've talked a lot about RTS as a sport.
2359.0,2365.0, Can you elaborate how you're trying to envision this as a I guess competition game.
2365.0,2368.0, I think that you start with good fundamentals.
2368.0,2382.0," I mean, the fast game play having a satisfying experience and you know like 15 or 20 minutes well balanced sides that lend themselves to a very sort of defined way the game plays out the early game."
2382.0,2384.0, The game and late game.
2384.0,2392.0, I think the designers have done a great job in setting up the sides so that there really well balanced against each other and that's.
2392.0,2396.0," Unfortunately, we only have a minute because Jason can address this topic and depth."
2396.0,2404.0, So I think the fundamentals are there and then the new features were adding like the ability to broadcast out your game to literally thousands of people.
2404.0,2409.0, It's just really kind of new is making it into almost like a spectator sport.
2409.0,2416.0," And when you say broadcasts you mean yeah, but what anybody who's around could actually just watch the match."
2416.0,2420.0, So you go website you can download a spectator client.
2420.0,2424.0, You don't even need to own the game and you can tune in and watch games and progress.
2424.0,2432.0, There are people in the community who can do voice over IP commentary and you tell a straighter markups on the screen to show you what's happening.
2432.0,2434.0, Move the camera over to the interesting moments.
2434.0,2442.0, So you can have guides through the experience that's show you from different perspectives what is going on.
2442.0,2453.0, And then what's really cool is the other features that support the this idea of RTS is a sport including the stats that we track.
2453.0,2460.0, The way that we allow you to schedule games or pick up games that happened happened in the past.
2460.0,2466.0, The reputation system that we're putting into place so that you can actually score people that you play against in that way.
2466.0,2473.0, We're hoping to turn the community and the people who play into a little bit of self-regulating entity.
2473.0,2478.0, And there's a lot of good stuff out there that I think.
2478.0,2483.0," Well, well, have this game living in multiplayer long after it's really cool."
2483.0,2488.0, Does this mean that you're kind of looking at this is like trying to supplants a starcraft in the world cyber games and stuff like that.
2488.0,2493.0, Like push it as kind of like the premier game for for competitive play.
2493.0,2497.0, We're doing everything we can to build a game that will be played competitively.
2497.0,2502.0," Ultimately, whether or not we succeed will be up to the people who play competitively."
2502.0,2511.0," So we are trying to make something that's worth the of their attention and and we hope, you know, through bringing the best player,"
2511.0,2516.0, the stance he players in the world onto our site to help balance and tune the game before we release it.
2516.0,2524.0," All these new multiplayer features that the design that's gotten into the decides and the way they interact with each other, the balance."
2524.0,2534.0," And again, we're working very hard to put all the foundation in place, but ultimately gamers will be the judges of whether this is worth the competitive play."
2534.0,2544.0," But you haven't talked any of those guys yet. You haven't gone to like, you know, those major like pro game competitions and got it, you know, got anywhere with feedback on that or."
2544.0,2558.0," Now, I mean, ultimately it's going to be the tens of thousands of people who actually play the games and I think it will track the attention of some of these other organizations is if the fundamentals are there."
2558.0,2559.0, Okay.
2559.0,2563.0, All right. I think we are probably at a time right. You guys had a time on your end.
2563.0,2572.0," Yes, we are you are. Thank you for joining us so many more questions. Yeah, we do have like about like at least another page full of questions here and no more crypto like question."
2572.0,2578.0," Maybe we can have you back though. Would you come back with it would be our pleasure. All right, we weren't too hard on you."
2578.0,2580.0, Not at all.
2580.0,2583.0, I know the answer to that. You weren't.
2583.0,2586.0, We could be way harder. I have the hardball question.
2586.0,2592.0," Well, thanks for joining us and we hope to have you back again sometime soon. Thank you. Thanks guys."
2592.0,2594.0, Good talking to you guys. You're talking to you.
2594.0,2601.0, So I've got coming out of that. I've got one comment now. Now that we're in the speaking of all the full motion video.
2601.0,2602.0, Are we in the most spend zone now?
2603.0,2609.0," No, no, what's that I couldn't say to them. I just didn't want to like throw them off. They had their very limited amount of time to talk to us."
2609.0,2612.0, Great. I'm going to waste their time. But I just wanted to say.
2612.0,2621.0, Now that we're in the digital video era. I want to see people when this game comes out making it at the own FMV sequences right into the gameplay.
2621.0,2622.0, The remix.
2622.0,2625.0, Some guys that's like show you show is neck bearded face going.
2625.0,2630.0, All right. Through all of your tanks and one clump into check now. They show him.
2630.0,2637.0," And then you cut to the video of the tanks that they just got wiped out by like one, you know, anti-armor counter measure that you cut back to him."
2637.0,2640.0, You stupid asshole. Why did you tell me to pull my tanks?
2640.0,2644.0, He's got like a fence on or something.
2644.0,2648.0, So some like cling on badges.
2648.0,2652.0," The same plastic sheriff's badge. You know, it was from the open in the background."
2652.0,2654.0, Junior high fair Western days fair.
2654.0,2657.0, You wanted to play in couch at Bingo.
2657.0,2663.0, Why did you make me throw those tanks to one clump by telling you I wanted to diversify my units.
2663.0,2664.0, That'd be hot though.
2664.0,2666.0, Do I tell you something like Rooster?
2666.0,2667.0," Yeah, keep calmer protected."
2667.0,2669.0, I gave someone all they need to become famous.
2669.0,2670.0, You got to run.
2670.0,2671.0, We have the tools go.
2671.0,2674.0, You got to I knew when I asked so we weren't we weren't hard on them.
2674.0,2677.0," It's kind of hard to do like a, you know,"
2677.0,2679.0, they had 15 minutes.
2679.0,2680.0, Right. And we're on the phone.
2680.0,2682.0," I don't want to come on and say, I can't."
2682.0,2683.0, So how come your game sucks?
2683.0,2684.0," Well, who even now?"
2684.0,2685.0, Not the worst.
2685.0,2686.0, We don't even know.
2686.0,2687.0," No, I'm not saying it."
2687.0,2691.0," No, but I think in the case of FMV would be like,"
2691.0,2694.0," do you feel confident going ahead? Like you kind of got to it by saying,"
2694.0,2696.0," hey, you're going to have a lot of new users in this."
2696.0,2699.0," And what you're what you're basically implying there is that to them,"
2699.0,2701.0, there's no history of FFD familiar.
2701.0,2703.0, That was just going to seem corny.
2703.0,2705.0, That was just going to work.
2705.0,2709.0," And their choice, which I totally respect, is to go ahead with it and avoid the"
2709.0,2710.0, kits from the past.
2710.0,2712.0," And just say, this is FMV."
2712.0,2714.0, This is how we've done this series.
2714.0,2715.0, This is how we're doing it.
2715.0,2717.0, And I think the danger would be to do like a way in
2717.0,2720.0, brother treatment on it and to get too tongue and cheek.
2720.0,2721.0," Oh, yeah."
2721.0,2725.0, I think they just go for it straight and just try to make it dramatic.
2725.0,2726.0," I mean, who knows?"
2726.0,2727.0," I mean, who knows?"
2727.0,2728.0, I do.
2728.0,2731.0," These actors, you know, these like I want to see it."
2731.0,2732.0, I do.
2732.0,2733.0, I admit it.
2733.0,2734.0," I'm a big bow, so I go like the fan."
2734.0,2735.0, I see them in the budget.
2735.0,2737.0," It's so much higher than like,"
2737.0,2741.0," I was going to ask them a second day that like part of me is going, okay, so"
2741.0,2744.0, maybe they can actually like get so easily possible that they can make this look great.
2744.0,2746.0," I mean, look, the new David Lynch movie, right?"
2746.0,2751.0, He shot that on digital video on store bought digital video camera.
2751.0,2752.0, So true.
2752.0,2757.0, The capabilities to make something good with that kind of technology are greater.
2757.0,2759.0, And I'd say anything wrong with Carrie were.
2759.0,2763.0," I love the body of her work, but it's always just been the disconnect between"
2764.0,2766.0, what you see that you're controlling.
2766.0,2769.0," So it's like you're going to be, you know, again, imagine that kid."
2769.0,2772.0," He's just to completely pissed off and obviously suddenly sees, you know,"
2772.0,2774.0," and then it cuts to Trisha Health, and he's like,"
2774.0,2776.0, Why don't you shut up in farm type.
2776.0,2779.0, You're even faster if you want to help me.
2779.0,2781.0," You know, and she's like, she's triplets."
2781.0,2784.0," Yeah, she's trying to tell her the battles playing out."
2784.0,2788.0, You should take off your shirt when you're far in that type of area.
2788.0,2789.0, Loles.
2789.0,2791.0, You might be saying that to Josh Holloway.
2792.0,2795.0," She's trying to film. She's got more to get off her chest and went t-shirts, you know,"
2795.0,2798.0, but we don't know if he's ready to hear it.
2798.0,2801.0," I wanted I meant to send them a message to give to guys,"
2801.0,2802.0, Balter.
2802.0,2804.0, But then I remember that.
2804.0,2807.0, Is he in the cast to remember he's not real.
2807.0,2808.0, Right.
2808.0,2810.0," Yeah, you're you're one step into the."
2810.0,2812.0, Tell guys here.
2812.0,2813.0, There.
2813.0,2815.0," Got a letter for guys, bald."
2815.0,2816.0," Guys, he's a traitor."
2816.0,2817.0," Oh, man."
2817.0,2818.0, He's a man.
2818.0,2819.0, He's green.
2819.0,2820.0," Yeah, he's green."
2820.0,2821.0, He's going to kick his ass.
2821.0,2823.0," Yeah, but he gets spit on in the streets too."
2823.0,2825.0," Yeah, Jeff's got his own fanfic."
2825.0,2828.0," Logged by the way, it's called Balter Star Galactica."
2828.0,2831.0," Actually, he's a filker."
2831.0,2833.0, And number six is my queen.
2833.0,2834.0, But it felt is it.
2834.0,2835.0, The filker felt.
2835.0,2837.0," No, no, no, no."
2837.0,2839.0," Oh, wow."
2839.0,2840.0, This was a felt.
2840.0,2842.0," Filk, filk, filk, filk."
2842.0,2843.0," Filk, filk, filk."
2843.0,2846.0, It's like folk fantasy folk music.
2846.0,2847.0," Yeah, folk music."
2847.0,2848.0," Yeah, or sci-fi."
2848.0,2851.0," Yeah, but you know, like if you see the movie track, it's like me."
2851.0,2852.0, Molotos you be.
2852.0,2854.0, There's like a guy in a wig and lipstick.
2854.0,2855.0, Did I see this?
2855.0,2856.0, And he said didn't see it.
2856.0,2857.0," Oh, you need to see tracking."
2857.0,2858.0, It's been on my Netflix.
2858.0,2859.0," Yeah, it's a few for a year."
2859.0,2860.0, I'll just loan it to you.
2860.0,2861.0, It's awesome.
2861.0,2862.0, Yeah.
2862.0,2863.0, So we're off.
2863.0,2864.0, We're not off top.
2864.0,2865.0, We're talking to Commander Conqueror and FMV.
2865.0,2866.0, We might as well.
2866.0,2868.0, We're not that far away from it from Filking.
2868.0,2869.0, Okay.
2869.0,2871.0, We're at 11.
2871.0,2872.0, 38.
2872.0,2874.0, Somebody's supposed to be using this room.
2874.0,2875.0, They're not here.
2875.0,2877.0, Probably the most free associate talking to.
2877.0,2878.0, Is it a damn retry?
2878.0,2879.0," Well, I mean, we had the hell that."
2879.0,2885.0," I mean, I wanted to if you wanted to talk about the AI stuff that I was talking that I before we started podcast."
2885.0,2886.0, I'm a good topic.
2886.0,2887.0, We have some news stories.
2887.0,2888.0," We've got some, you know, great."
2888.0,2890.0, I can talk about the 8.
2890.0,2893.0, I played it like a couple weeks ago when I was still in town.
2893.0,2894.0, Okay.
2894.0,2896.0, I could talk about how New York pizza rock still.
2896.0,2897.0, Not on talk about.
2897.0,2898.0, Okay.
2898.0,2899.0, But we could talk about how Kate.
2899.0,2900.0, I'd be interested in that.
2900.0,2901.0, Let's talk about how Kate.
2901.0,2902.0, How Kate.
2902.0,2904.0, Was on our cover.
2904.0,2905.0," Oh, gosh."
2905.0,2906.0, May.
2906.0,2907.0, May.
2907.0,2908.0, May it was past May.
2908.0,2909.0, It's past like years ago.
2909.0,2910.0, Okay.
2910.0,2914.0," That's the game from flagship studios, which are the guys who broke off from"
2914.0,2915.0, Blizzard North.
2915.0,2916.0, Mm-hmm.
2916.0,2920.0, So this is the all of the main creators of Diablo 2 and Diablo 1.
2920.0,2921.0, Yeah.
2921.0,2923.0, So this is the Diablo folks.
2923.0,2926.0, And this is their new game that we've been waiting for.
2926.0,2928.0, Their first game as flagship studios.
2928.0,2931.0, And Darren went and played it a little while ago.
2931.0,2935.0," And it's still, it'll be ready when it's ready."
2935.0,2940.0," They're saying sometime in mid 2007 at this point, hopefully people will be playing online"
2940.0,2943.0, Beta sooner.
2943.0,2947.0," The Hunter, the third character, we actually called it in the May cover story."
2947.0,2950.0," They didn't announce it, but we kind of dug out some information and kind of guessed it."
2950.0,2952.0, So I want them to hurry up on this one.
2952.0,2953.0, I really do.
2953.0,2955.0," Starting to get into the like, yeah, come back to you."
2955.0,2956.0, Yeah.
2956.0,2957.0, And you got something.
2957.0,2959.0," You know, I think the problem is, is one of those, they, it was those mysteries."
2959.0,2963.0," So it was, they, they first rolled out of the studio, they first,"
2963.0,2967.0," like, let me see, I thought it flagship form in 2003."
2967.0,2969.0," They announced it, the following March."
2969.0,2973.0," And then we did a follow up, like a year later, just to find out what's going on, what's taking so long."
2973.0,2976.0," And now I'm just kind of like, it's like the, the, the anxiousness is there."
2976.0,2980.0," I mean, there's seriously no reason to doubt this team's ability."
2980.0,2982.0," I mean, they made two of the greatest,"
2982.0,2984.0, some of those popular PC games ever.
2984.0,2986.0," You know, this is that team."
2986.0,2987.0, It's not even a subset of that team.
2987.0,2989.0, This is like the main Diablo folks.
2989.0,2990.0, Right.
2990.0,2991.0, So.
2991.0,2994.0," Okay. So I think people talk to death about the, the, the, the first guy that was interested"
2994.0,2996.0," to the Templar that was basically, it's melee class."
2996.0,2998.0, Templars are coming back these days.
2998.0,2999.0," I'm telling you, man."
2999.0,3000.0, Templars are in.
3000.0,3002.0," We can't talk about just how, but they're popping up all those."
3002.0,3004.0," Templars, they're basically, yeah."
3004.0,3005.0, Yeah.
3005.0,3006.0," Templars, they're new black."
3006.0,3007.0," Then there's a,"
3007.0,3010.0," Color black as,"
3010.0,3011.0, Okay.
3011.0,3012.0, Not African American.
3012.0,3013.0, Correct.
3013.0,3014.0, I'm talking about outfits.
3014.0,3015.0, Anyway.
3015.0,3017.0, We're lavé Katellist.
3017.0,3032.3," Magic user spllslinger, uh,"
3032.3,3033.0, playground fans.
3033.0,3035.0," Medot fans, totally."
3035.0,3039.0," So, I remember when I got that."
3039.0,3041.0," The biggest thing was kind of, um, the,"
3041.0,3043.0," you know, the."
3043.0,3046.44, online lobby area where you would gather and then go out on
3046.44,3051.8, on adventures and that thunder was stolen a little bit by
3051.8,3056.04," gold wars in the meantime. Well, you think it was, but then again,"
3056.04,3059.8," that was all stolen from a different universe, but fantasy story."
3059.8,3062.52," Yeah. I mean, basically on a smaller level, that's what they were,"
3062.52,3065.4, that's what they've been doing for years since like what 2000.
3065.4,3068.68," Wasn't that what? Dioves? And that's exactly what I was going to say. Well, right,"
3068.68,3073.0," but Diablo, you were in a chat lobby. Right."
3073.0,3076.7599999999998," Right. Well, it was supposed to be in the world. Right. Diablo is a text-based chat room."
3077.8799999999997,3082.12," The fantasy star was a hub-based world, a graphical representation of that."
3082.12,3085.24, Then it was Guild Wars. And now it's basically the next logical steps
3085.24,3089.0," with what Helgage do it. It's no big deal anymore. Yeah. Yes. It's like, okay."
3089.0,3092.04," But it's still like, but they're, but they're trying to do like more of a community push"
3092.04,3096.12, and whatever. But like the main thing that we're showing off when I was there
3096.2,3101.48," what two weeks ago now, I think was the Hunter class, which actually plays a lot like an FPS game."
3101.48,3105.4," The one thing that I thought was kind of weird at first is that, I mean, like my first instance,"
3105.4,3111.4," I'm in the arcade, a reload after shooting, there's no ammo. So you start like the hyperblaster."
3111.4,3114.8399999999997," Kind of. Kind of. You have it. It's a cooldown. Is actually, you know, a temperature gauge."
3114.8399999999997,3118.04," It's a different heat. Is that, it's how the hyperblaster works in these quick wars."
3118.04,3121.3199999999997," I mean, yeah, quick wars is supposed to be. So the general idea is you start off a class."
3121.32,3125.8," And you pick from, I mean, actually, you're randomly start with one of three types of different"
3125.8,3131.0," weapons sets. You come with like dual, dual pistols, some kind of like, you know, Uber machine"
3131.0,3135.2400000000002, gun kind of the only just kind of go from there. Kids like that double fisting. So they should do.
3139.0,3143.6400000000003," Next up, I want double fisting man-holling. I think that went page."
3144.6,3150.8399999999997, Oh my god. But let me section to edit. We'll do it every time you read.
3150.8399999999997,3155.56," So the previous like, you know, ever since Halo 2 everyone's like, you got double fisting action."
3155.56,3161.4," And I'm like, well, this subtext is there, you know, I mean, it's kind of like, I think Frank Miller's 300"
3161.4,3167.24," is like all, you know, it's like naked guys with like big spears. Right, you know, I'm just saying."
3167.24,3171.64," Yeah, I'm just saying. I'm just saying I'm being there opening night. That's all. That's right."
3171.96,3177.96," Farrell going with you. Hello, owners. I don't apologize. If you pick these terms,"
3177.96,3183.56, you got to be aware of the possibly aware of that fair enough fair. We've warned it.
3183.56,3191.0," All right. They know. They do know. So anyway, so as a missile class, these guys are like,"
3191.0,3195.0," good at a distance, but they have crap shields and they recharge and stuff. Kind of like,"
3195.0,3199.56," you know, in Halo, I guess. And they have tinker abilities that you can like level up"
3199.64,3203.56," among with other skills. So like, let's see if I know weapon you can't use. You can create a drone"
3203.56,3207.7999999999997, that holds that weapon and shoots it and follows your around. Like a hunter class and what?
3207.7999999999997,3213.16, Or the mag in the fantasy star online or like the mag in fantasy star online. Mags didn't shoot anything.
3213.16,3217.4," The one thing I felt was kind of weird though is like, there's like, there's so many conventions of"
3217.4,3221.32," a first person, sure. You used to like say crowd like I said we were loading, but also crouching."
3221.32,3225.0," That becomes a skill you activate. So instead of instead of doing a running crouch,"
3225.08,3230.28, you have to hotkey it to like the number two and like you just stay in one position crouch and
3230.28,3233.72," you have to get up again and move. Well, that's always been the interesting thing about this game,"
3233.72,3240.52, right? It's it's it's really weird hybrid. Yeah. A Diablo style game with FPS abilities in it.
3240.52,3244.68, Exactly. And I think that's the whole compelling. That's why I want to see it. And they pull this off.
3244.68,3248.76, And the thing was I specifically joined it. We played multiplayer and I joined a group. We did
3248.76,3252.36, one on a couple quests where I made shows in a group where there was a bunch of people represented
3252.36,3258.36, in the different classes. And obviously the team's speak was having like a voice calm wasn't in place.
3258.36,3264.92, But the idea of organizing the troops is kind of cool. But the one thing that I felt was obviously
3264.92,3270.2000000000003, they're tweaking. But all the pet classes like a summoner is like you don't have that much control.
3270.2000000000003,3275.0, You don't have any control really over these guys. You can't set agro levels or anything because
3275.0,3281.2400000000002," if my bot sees some other due to the environment, he's just he's off chasing them down and"
3281.3199999999997,3288.4399999999996, like in a proximity. I hope they don't rely on a voice chat as a like I hope that's not going to be key
3288.4399999999996,3294.2799999999997," because because seriously, I feel like that technology always needs to be optional."
3294.2799999999997,3297.7999999999997, I just don't want to play games that way. That's the deal. Yeah. Like if there's some way
3297.7999999999997,3301.4799999999996," to like like great with your friends, not so great with strangers. Yeah. I don't want to be playing a"
3301.4799999999996,3305.56, game and then be taken order from at 12 years. Yeah. Just go it out. Go on. Like stocks lies.
3305.56,3309.72, Any time you want to remind me of the why it should be optional. Just hop on to Xbox Live.
3309.7999999999997,3313.7999999999997," Yeah. I mean, not only do I want to hear a little kids, but I don't want to look like a fool"
3313.7999999999997,3320.7599999999998, and fun of my wife and kid at home. It's hard enough being a grown person playing games without
3320.7599999999998,3326.68, like looking like sounding like a full at home. I didn't reload. It could be anyone.
3326.68,3332.04, But more times than not though the game kind of just it was kind of like everyone was just kind of like
3332.04,3335.64, I wouldn't say off doing their own thing. It was like two distinct groups. There was the
3335.72,3339.24, the Ninja looters who were ring-ronged and like scavenging the environment. Yeah. And then there was
3339.24,3344.7599999999998, those who were just kind of waiting right into the mess. And it was kind of hard to keep tabs on
3344.7599999999998,3348.12," everyone. I wish like as a team leader. Even just something as simple as saying, okay, we're going to"
3348.12,3353.08, target this area or some kind of like without having to say it just kind of like you click on a target
3353.08,3357.24," and everyone else can see who you're targeting. It's a little thing like that could help. Otherwise,"
3357.24,3361.48," it is a very interesting step. I mean, I don't know how they like when I talk to Roper about it,"
3361.48,3366.12," he said it's about 75, 80% there. So I mean so I'm not there three years. Yeah."
3366.12,3371.4," Yeah. I'm psyched for it. I don't mean to come down on it, I just want to see it."
3371.4,3376.92, Yeah. This one is like I will play it when it comes out. It does bring another about already.
3376.92,3379.56," It does bring another question though. I think we kind of hinted upon this earlier is like,"
3379.56,3383.56, I almost wish that like they don't tell us about games too soon in the process because then
3383.56,3387.88, you end up you get the height machine roll into a suit and you're like. Right. Then we're a big
3388.52,3393.0," large part of. Right. I think we're guilty. This is well, but I think is right. Right. Now,"
3393.0,3398.12," for example, with Helgate, if no one knew about it until the May issue, right. The first place,"
3398.12,3402.2000000000003," they'd be like, Oh, cool. This is coming up. Right. Well, I just, you know, I'm in the middle of"
3402.2000000000003,3407.56, working on a Q&A with the Huxley guys and I went back to look at what we wrote about it and we did
3407.56,3414.44," that cover story in November 2005. I mean, this is nothing new. This is no surprise."
3414.44,3420.6," That's how it's been. Games take years to develop, but you got to wonder, you know, when it's too early"
3420.6,3427.0, for us to start publicizing it or when it's when it's too early for them to do it and when it's too early
3427.0,3432.52," for us to sort of. Yeah, for all the developers listening out there, I still like to get the first"
3432.52,3437.32," first word on. Yeah, I'm not saying, oh, yeah, don't. Yeah, please come to us for the scoop."
3438.36,3442.36," Definitely that. But I mean, it's just like, just a matter of like, you know, adjust me to plan"
3442.44,3446.44," to get the word out at the right time and not like kind of that build the buzz up to like, well,"
3446.44,3451.08," it's tough. I mean, this is a whole other podcast discussion, right? Because of course,"
3451.08,3457.08," everybody wants to be the magazine or the website or whatever to break the story, but on the other hand,"
3457.08,3462.92," you know, we could talk forever about like the cover curse of, you know, games that we put on our"
3462.92,3467.4," cover and then three years later, I came out and it was a piece of crap. That's great game of the"
3467.4,3473.32," year fodder, by the way. Yeah. So I don't know. Maybe it's, I mean, it is more of a market. I think it"
3473.32,3476.92," is more of a marketing question, really. And it's just maybe it requires getting a marketing person on the"
3476.92,3482.44," phone or something and that would be exciting. Some of it. Yeah. I mean, watch the spin machine roll on"
3482.44,3487.56," that one. The technique, I think, as it is now is to come out and have various media and press"
3487.56,3491.32," blast where that happens, and then they kind of go under the radar for a while. And then, you know,"
3491.32,3495.48," as it gets approaches, you know, launch time, then they start coming out with it again, but one kind of"
3495.56,3500.04," interesting thing. I mean, I have no idea if it's on their mind or not, is just the ability to,"
3500.04,3505.56," you know, to say that you were these were your ideas first, you know. So say for example, like,"
3505.56,3510.12," you know, we were talking to the guys from CNC, what if they just announced the premise for CNC"
3510.12,3516.12," three right now, then everyone's going to be like, you freaking ripped off Superman. Why do you do that?"
3516.12,3519.72," They look like, you know, at least they could say, hey, or, but in terms of other games, you know,"
3519.72,3524.44," like, sure, sure. Another game like Huxley, you know, was announced whatever two months ago,"
3524.44,3528.28, and then Huxley's still in men now. So it's kind of matter of like who's copying who and stuff and
3528.28,3531.64," not that I mean, I don't know if they're plays in one. And that's also why the developers keep"
3531.64,3536.84," stuff closer to the chest, right? Especially like MMO developers, like, they might actually have"
3537.32,3542.28," some cool innovations, but if other teams get wind effect, they can throw their guns there."
3542.28,3548.36," There's a lot of times, there are two, they do people do one a way. I think because of the"
3548.36,3552.36," amount of dollars involved in this industry, unlike, you know, if it was a website or something"
3552.44,3556.1200000000003," and someone had an idea, like sure, as soon as it's out, the genius out of the bottle,"
3556.1200000000003,3559.8," everyone's going to rip it off, putting games. It's like, you wait for someone else to pull the"
3559.8,3565.6400000000003," trigger because the consequences could be disastrous. They could be, you know, so so. And it's"
3565.6400000000003,3569.88," only when they're great that you get the people in the big spot say, okay, that's good. We need to"
3569.88,3576.6," do that in our game. That's what's hot right now. Right. We're still sort of, we're just running on"
3577.48,3583.3199999999997," on a few. Not few. As we go, we can get that. No, I'm just wondering if we're going to get cut off here."
3583.3199999999997,3586.52," But I just hit the hour mark to say, we'll keep talking. We can do the right thing. We have a"
3586.52,3591.16, whole bunch of news items. We're not getting booted out of the room for once. So we keep talking.
3591.16,3594.6," Those like those like those, those right turn on missions. You want to go through a"
3594.7599999999998,3598.44," so new stuff or just a quick thing. You want me to start off with this. Oh, please. Yeah,"
3598.44,3604.92," I did the right. Yeah, it's a great. I got this from quarter to three forms poster Tim Partlet who I"
3604.92,3612.6," believe works for Chris employed with CryTek, makers of Crysis and Far Cry. And he posted to discuss"
3612.6,3619.96, how you know current undergoing a legislation in Germany to effectively ban violent video games.
3619.96,3624.44," You know, similar to some of the campaigns that pop up here. Sounds a little more helpful up there,"
3624.44,3631.2400000000002," though. And then yeah. So in the context of this, like I'll give you here's what is prime"
3631.3999999999996,3637.8799999999997," concern is this is, uh, the area, which is where coberg is located. And that's where CryTek used to be"
3637.8799999999997,3642.7599999999998," before they moved to Frankfurt, Germany somewhat west of there. But he says, but various a conservative"
3642.7599999999998,3647.08, state possibly the most conservative of an already conservative nation. The state president of a
3647.08,3651.08," very, Dr. Edmund's story where we're now in for someone bizarre habit of dressing and letter,"
3651.08,3655.64, sinpinthe tyroly and hat made it clear that before the rate how much he despised the kind of
3655.64,3661.7999999999997, killer games that we made. This is being CryTek. And it is again from a very with a laiss attempt
3661.7999999999997,3666.8399999999997," of ban computer games, a stirring. Let me see here. I'm like reading around the wrong spot."
3668.2799999999997,3671.8799999999997," Okay. Anyway, the current, the current legislation is basically summarizes this."
3672.7599999999998,3677.0, A new law would say that those who distribute produce obtainer deliver computer games that allow
3677.0,3681.8799999999997, the player to perform violent acts against human beings in a crew way or a way violating human
3681.88,3686.92, dignity as a primary or secondary objective. We punish with the fine or imprisonment of up to one
3686.92,3689.6400000000003," year. They should have had that back during Nazi Germany, huh?"
3691.6400000000003,3696.12," I'm just saying whoa. Okay. So now, are there any train cars pulling up an A and"
3696.92,3702.92," what he reveals now in light of this? And that legislation is current. But back in 2004,"
3702.92,3707.56, something rather extraordinary. And I'm surprised we had to heard about it until now happened to CryTek.
3707.96,3714.2," And I'll just read from his post here. Okay. In 2004, the authorities sent in the state troopers."
3714.2,3718.52, ostensibly it was as a response to a claim made by a former employee that we had a legal software
3718.52,3722.7599999999998, installed on our machines. They're a mate however appeared to be a lot wider. When the small
3722.7599999999998,3727.72," tech team appeared to inspect our computers, they were accompanying by over 100 flat jacketed riot"
3727.72,3733.0, police. All armed with heckling talks of machine guns. It was like they expected to find this
3733.0,3736.6, hunkered down behind our desk pulling out of shotguns and semi-autos. Showing you in front of
3736.6,3741.48," the trains? You'll never take me alive, Polize. They arrived first thing in the morning and kicked"
3741.48,3746.28, our doors down. They even rated a nearby private residents with one of our programs forced to
3746.28,3750.84, lay down naked on the floor with the gun to his head after he discovered armed police in his room
3750.84,3755.0, while finishing his shower. That's kind of hot. Because we weren't all at work at the same
3755.0,3759.24, one godly hour that most Germans start. They were forced to set up ambushes all over town.
3759.3199999999997,3763.56, I was caught just outside the office. Others were pounced on in the park. There were ports that
3763.56,3768.8399999999997, they even set up roblox on the exits to the town. We were all shepherded into our motion capture studio.
3769.3999999999996,3774.2799999999997, And there we were forced to remain until question prevented from leading by dozens of armed guards.
3774.2799999999997,3778.2, There must have been two guys and girls with submachine guns for every one of us.
3778.2,3783.3999999999996," You know, imagine we didn't feel very welcome and but very after that. So maybe aside from the story"
3783.3999999999996,3787.24, we got as to why they moved to Frankfurt being you know a bigger uh...
3787.24,3791.7999999999997, He has not been done with it. They have blip blip blip proof. Glass and redness.
3793.7999999999997,3798.52, So I just thought that was fun story. And that was off because they supposedly had illegal software.
3798.52,3802.3599999999997," Right, allegedly had illegal software on. So the basically Gordon off the entire if we can"
3802.3599999999997,3807.7999999999997, believe Tim Hartlitz report the court and off the entire town and descended on him with
3807.7999999999997,3813.8799999999997, other special forces teams. I'm I are you implying are the implication that this was because
3814.2000000000003,3821.4," they were making a game. Yes, so I think his driving connection that they're not looked on very kindly"
3822.52,3827.0," by certain parts of you know of the bovarian government, you know. But it's interesting because I know"
3827.0,3831.1600000000003, there's probably a great deal of pride in Germany for you know being home to places like
3831.1600000000003,3835.1600000000003," Crytek and the guys that make Gothic 3 and stuff like that, you know. It's not in bovaria."
3835.1600000000003,3839.4," I mean, yeah, it's not bovaria. So maybe it was good to see you know."
3839.4,3845.08, That off your tourist destination spot. Or boycott the beer in the country.
3845.08,3848.44," Yeah, don't be playing your yeah, your DS and a German cafe there."
3849.48,3852.44, I heard this because the cream comes from bovaria. I don't get an item.
3854.28,3857.64, That's kind of a creepy story. This is very creepy. There's got some more news.
3857.64,3864.12," And that's hardly as creepy. But interesting nonetheless. So one of the first, okay besides Robo"
3864.12,3868.6," Blitz, one of the first games to come out on the PC with the Unreal 3 engine. Yes."
3868.6,3872.2799999999997, Is Rainbow Six Vegas. So I don't know. Has anyone here had a chance to play?
3872.2799999999997,3876.2, That game is using Unreal Engine 3. Using a modified version of a technically according to
3876.2,3881.4," where a port looks like shit. Yeah, yeah, my view apparently it's like what they're saying is like it's"
3881.4,3885.96," more like Unreal 2.5. Yeah, I know it's a hard by Unreal. But it's got to be I thought when I play"
3885.96,3890.12," okay 2.5. Well, the plan to stop in one point, you know, because they're because up and from what I"
3890.12,3893.56," understand up until the end of Gears of War, they're kind of building out the Unreal 3 engine."
3894.2,3898.2," So at some point in the process, they just had to say stop and then go forward to there."
3898.2,3902.68," I guess we should clarify that when Sean Elliott, this is for a Ubisoft when Sean Elliott said it"
3902.68,3908.12," looked like it's hyperbole. He actually meant it look great. I mean, for an Unreal Engine"
3908.12,3911.88," for an Unreal Engine 3 game, I would say it looks like shit. It looks great for an"
3911.88,3916.52," 2.5. Actually, it looks pretty bad. I'm not back to that either. I would look fantastic with"
3916.52,3921.0," that engine. But when you go back and forth between playing that and playing, you know, like"
3921.0,3926.12," you're a war or something, or even to me, like some of the stuff on source right now or"
3926.12,3929.96," other other, you know, it's cool. I was just saying it doesn't. I'm going to get later."
3929.96,3935.24," Yeah, it's just a bunch of things to eat. A lot of low-rest textures, not much normal mapping."
3938.52,3943.56, Shit on our scale. It's great. I'll try to be slice on the podcast.
3943.56,3949.96," That would put that in print. So basically a corny turd is a zero on our scale. Oh, please."
3951.96,3958.36," Well, that's disgusting. Oh, just that. Okay. Okay. So back to this back to this back to this back to this."
3958.36,3963.64," So the point, okay, so if you go to AMDzone.com, nothing and they ran some tests. And I think we've kind of,"
3963.64,3966.84," we were talking about this earlier. Well, I would forget whether we were recording or not, but"
3967.56,3973.0," there's a question I know Valda is on the same page. Or there's a dual core, while interesting,"
3973.0,3977.24," is not giving the huge performance leaps that they're expecting and really quad cores,"
3977.24,3980.44," where it's really like Kent's field, which is kind of happening right now on in for Intel."
3980.44,3987.08, So everyone that's waiting to be got the dual cores this year. This is the big dangerous wager you
3987.08,3991.48, make with every time. And then. And this is exactly why. You might have got yourself a beta max.
3991.48,3998.12," And that's exactly why. That's great. Yeah. Well, and that's exactly why. Whenever you don't ever"
3998.12,4003.16," go toward the bleeding edge high end of the scale, because release weight until the next big."
4003.16,4007.0," Yeah, but how do we, you know, the trick is to wait for those eight thousand articles about how"
4007.08,4012.6," great dual core. Right. And now you're about gaming. Yeah. Yeah. They're in Rotem. But now you're saying,"
4012.6,4016.76," they're just for now you're saying, you're saying that it's quad core. Like how do I not"
4016.76,4021.16," address that? Well, that's what we're doing. Wait for it. We're both parody like prominent developers."
4021.16,4027.48," So now we've got, and we've got Val both saying that, hey, it's quad core, but I don't get enough"
4027.48,4031.96," return off of the dual core. Well, I'll just all reference what I was saying in my own articles."
4031.96,4037.4," If your bother reading the tech section, the, uh, we, I know, I actually, I pointed people to say,"
4037.4,4041.0, don't bother buying the high end stuff. Go for like the middle of the road chips or like
4041.0,4045.48, 300 bucks. And they give you pretty solid performance. Right. And that's your hold off. But that's
4045.48,4050.36," said, okay. So anyway, AMD zone dot com. They can't in their tests. They found that at low"
4050.36,4055.96," resolutions 10 by 7. They were getting really good performance. Well, pretty good performance scores."
4055.96,4060.68," So like with everything turned on and dual core versus single core, it was a difference of"
4060.68,4067.16," like, let me see 35 versus 49 frames per second. But as you jack up the resolution, it got closer and"
4067.16,4072.44," close or so finally when you get up to 16 by 12, it was a matter of a two frame per second difference"
4072.44,4077.72, between two dual core and single core. So it's an interesting task. I'd be pretty annoyed if I had
4077.72,4081.3199999999997," this. And this is using, um, what the heck? Well, I think it's just using, okay. So this is using,"
4081.3199999999997,4084.12," I'm going to read, I'm reading the things off the minute. A lot of that's going to come down to"
4084.12,4088.2," how the developers are coding. Yes, of course. I mean, like, all going to come down to that."
4088.3599999999997,4092.3599999999997," And in all, in all disclosure, here, here's the full rundown. So it's, uh,"
4092.3599999999997,4098.2," AMD, F1, FX62, G488, 100 GTX, the new high-end kick-ass board."
4099.24,4106.92," Two gigs of core CRM using a 550 watt power supply, 320 gigabyte hard drive. You get the idea."
4107.72,4110.12," So I mean, this is not, this is not a piece of crap machine. This is,"
4110.12,4113.4," you can, it's not, it's not exactly bleeding edge, but it's just kind of interesting"
4113.4,4117.4," the results are shut with the results are showing. Right. And it's a matter of, like,"
4117.4,4121.0," I can't, I'm curious to see what other developers will join. Maybe Valve, well, who knows?"
4121.0,4124.44," I honestly don't think they're going to pull about face at this point and say, hey, do a core,"
4124.44,4129.5599999999995," actually, to task. Also, because they're developing so much, so many AI and physics applications"
4129.5599999999995,4134.36," for quad core at the moment. But if other developers join in and say, hey, you know, it's just not worth"
4134.36,4139.879999999999," the effort to do all this kind of, you know, wizard grief for the, the do a core. And also,"
4140.2,4144.6," one of the things should be pointed out, this is AMD zone. And everyone kind of recognizes these"
4144.6,4149.4800000000005," days that Intel is a better chip. Right. So, I mean, like these numbers could be totally, you know,"
4149.4800000000005,4153.24," obviously, if you have an AMD, this is going to matter to you. And if you live in die by that,"
4153.24,4157.72," then you're, it's going to matter, but Intel is changing over here because whenever we talk about,"
4157.72,4163.72," I mean, any hardware tests in the magazine always yield like 20 angry phone calls from hardware vendors."
4163.72,4167.72," So, so Darren, I might say, good. We'll put it like you said, I mean,"
4168.280000000001,4172.68," put it on also on the developers too because you have to, if you're going to effectively use it,"
4172.68,4177.8, you need to distribute the tasks that your game is performing. AI physics and other things amongst
4177.8,4181.16," the processors. Yeah. You do, you know, various things game to work. But it's like, and it's just,"
4181.16,4185.4800000000005," but it's kind of like what the penetration rate is it going to, you know, is it going to pay off to"
4185.4800000000005,4191.08," put all this effort into it if only 3% of our of our user base has got these things, you know,"
4191.08,4194.6," yeah, there's so many things involved in it. It's not, I mean, it's not easy to just put the blame."
4194.6,4199.96," And again, and again, I'm saying, like, these are these are the results of AMD's own, but like from what we've"
4199.96,4203.64," heard from like, you know, Val is that they're saying that, you know, they're the soldiers saying that"
4204.360000000001,4207.72, you have to wait for a quiet court to get the real return on your investment. And this is for game too.
4207.72,4211.0," I mean, if you're, if you're working like multiple programs, you know, uh,"
4212.04,4216.280000000001," drafting programs and in design and things like that, the do of course, it's going to be a big help for you, right?"
4216.280000000001,4220.4400000000005," I mean, well, yeah, I mean, like, I mean, when you, when you a lot of CPU intensive stuff,"
4220.5199999999995,4224.5199999999995," you want to juggle activities, like I, I'm a nerd, I do a lot of other stuff besides just gaming."
4224.5199999999995,4228.36," I'm like, I do video compression. I do like, you know, other things on the side."
4228.36,4233.799999999999," Right. And it does juggle. I mean, if you defend the morals that you paid however much money to get"
4233.799999999999,4239.799999999999," two frames a second advantage at a one on a computer game, might not have been like the target"
4239.799999999999,4245.719999999999," on it's for the two points. Yeah. Exactly. I think that's kind of like the point we've, we've always"
4245.719999999999,4249.16," said in the magazine is just kind of like, be aware of what's going on and like where things are at the"
4249.16,4254.92," industry and cancephil's around the corner and like, you know, prices are going to skew again, of course."
4254.92,4262.04," Right. So for the time being, uh, I bet, be happy with what you got. I mean, I mean, if anything,"
4262.04,4266.76," I've, I've been pretty, I've been pretty much a guest into like friends of mine who have been asking"
4266.76,4270.04," about buying a computer weight because yeah, I'm just waiting. No, no, no, no,"
4270.04,4274.2," thing is because with with this to come out, like, it's all technically it's legacy hardware"
4274.2,4279.88," optimized for HP. Right. I got a copy of Vista yesterday, by the way. Yeah. Thank you."
4279.88,4285.5599999999995," I'm right. I'm afraid to install it. You know what? I'm, I, it's the basic stuff. I mean, if you"
4285.5599999999995,4289.08," have like, Chris, standard issue stuff that's out there right now for the most part at works."
4289.88,4293.32," For the most part for the most, that's not going to convince. I'm still still still."
4293.32,4296.92," I'm on the order to think and have a hair and what the roof, you're being a me core. Well, the"
4296.92,4300.599999999999," mind boggling part that I wrote about in our story is that it won't, well, right now won't"
4300.68,4306.4400000000005," support like the the 80 to 100s. If you have more, which I don't or the X-Fi, which I do exact."
4306.4400000000005,4311.0," Okay. So you're getting it. I mean, granted, I've been out of the road the past week, so I haven't"
4311.0,4317.08," had chance to check the drive updates, but maybe. All right. It's just anything now. Let's keep going"
4317.08,4321.08, down the cough. Staying new. I'm going to buy it. Right. Yeah. That's right. This is just totally like
4321.08,4326.4400000000005," old school. Like, I'm like, smitty reading the news. Everyone out there. There's giant coffee stains"
4326.5199999999995,4331.4," on the news because my latte dumped over on. Yeah. Thanks, buddy. That's great. We forgot the news."
4331.4,4337.0, Ticker sounds like there it is. I can edit that anyway. Okay. Yeah. It just didn't run up.
4338.679999999999,4340.44, More on. Come here.
4343.16,4351.0, That's how we start that. All right. I don't know what that was. Next up. You get sounds. I hear music and it's
4351.0,4355.88," all one. It's all one continuous thing, guys. It's your hand. It's a party in your head all"
4355.88,4362.52," the time. Do I hear any kind of like, and that's mortal combat soundtrack to me. Wow. Right. Start."
4362.52,4369.72," Ticker. Ticker. Ticker. Ticker. Ticker. Ticker. Ticker. Ticker. All right. So guys, we're going to have a candlelight."
4369.72,4376.24, Wait. Wait. Wait. We're going to have a candlelight vigil for Doug Lowenstein leaving the
4376.32,4381.92, ESA. Him and Shang T song. I know it's not how you say it. That's how I say it. All right. So I got the
4381.92,4387.36," beef with Doug Lowenstein. Yeah. You know, he had a really rough gig. No doubt. The ESAB is just a rough"
4387.36,4392.16," gig. Yeah. So for those who don't know Doug Lowenstein had the, well, he's been there since what the"
4392.16,4397.04," beginning when it was the, was the interactive digital software association before becoming the ESA."
4397.599999999999,4402.24, He's been there since 94. Perhaps we should explain what the ESAB is for those who don't know.
4402.32,4408.5599999999995," I know it's the, say it to buyer. No, ESA. Not to try. No, the ESA. Yes. He's part right. What is the entertainment"
4408.5599999999995,4414.24," software association? Right. So the, if the, if the official, anyway, so so he left recently. I'm probably"
4414.24,4421.04," tired of all the crappy gets from us. But he, uh, after he was, these are the guys in charge of E3."
4421.04,4426.32," They're supposed to be the pro gaming lobbyists in Washington. And he's left to do his own,"
4426.32,4430.0, he's left the game industry altogether to do his own thing. It's got to be hard to be part of the
4430.08,4435.76," pro gaming lobby in Washington. You know, not much love there. Yeah. You got to be part of tobacco or"
4435.76,4440.48, game. I wonder how much it's been on lobbyists. I don't know. I probably not a whole lot.
4440.48,4444.88," You never hear about it. It's been where I, when you're actually not spending enough. Right. I mean,"
4444.88,4448.56," I mean, saying that you're, you represent the game lobby and in in Washington must be like saying,"
4448.56,4452.4," I, I promote child abuse. I mean, it's so, it's like, let's have a look at us."
4452.4,4457.04, Happens on. Yeah. They probably do sit next to the a child abuse and child molester
4457.04,4462.56, pro lives. Yeah. It's a so ridiculous corner. What are you here for? I'm here to support the child molesters.
4462.56,4466.32," What are you here for? I'm here for a computer game. So I'm so good. Oh, dude. That sucks."
4468.56,4474.96," Yeah. Well, anyway, by Doug. Anyway, by Doug. By Doug. Good luck. And there's, there's that bit of news."
4475.76,4483.5199999999995, Okay. But I had a bit of a little gaming insider. He made insider stuff. Nobody cares. All right.
4484.0,4487.360000000001, But everyone cares about Raph Coster or is it Raph Coster? How do you pronounce that?
4487.360000000001,4490.160000000001, Raph. It's Raph. That's what I thought. Raph. Ralf. Ralf.
4490.96,4498.320000000001," All right. It's be nice to Raph. Okay. So, uh, this, he, he's always big on ideas and he has a theory of fun."
4498.88,4505.120000000001," But his games. Are they? I said be nice. Okay. He is not. He is, you know what?"
4505.76,4510.160000000001," Right. That's what I would wrap past Raph's. Right. Actually, Ryan's a huge fan. You know, you,"
4510.24,4517.28," you live in a Ryan is. I was huge fan of you. Oh, but. Okay. So the news is that Raph Coster, who is one of the,"
4518.24,4523.44," one of the gaming industries, long term developers. He helped create,"
4523.44,4527.76," ultimately online. He helped create. As far as he likes to start. Scott sees, uh,"
4527.76,4532.4," every quest he's been a Sony for a long time. He has, has now started his own company called,"
4532.96,4537.5199999999995," eh, what the, called. Area A, R E A E. Area A. I'm sorry."
4537.5199999999995,4541.28," Reaching enough. He was on quarter to three, and people asked him how to pronounce his"
4541.28,4546.24," company's name and he himself didn't quite know. Well, they have a pronunciation guy on the website."
4546.24,4550.32," Sony are great. He's like the week. Well, I guess it was like three official"
4550.32,4554.4," pronunciation, some of this word is. All right. Uh-huh. Right. On the front page of his website,"
4554.4,4558.719999999999," it's like, here's how to pronounce this word. You can do it this way or this way. It doesn't"
4559.6,4564.240000000001," really matter. Okay. So what it means. So, so basically, uh, to summarize a quote as a"
4564.240000000001,4568.08," he gave at Austin Game Comments, it kind of hinted what he wants to try to get accomplished."
4568.08,4571.2," The things I'm really interested in doing, and for that matter, the things that the start"
4571.2,4575.52, up are going to be centered around are essentially not really things that fit into the standard
4575.52,4579.280000000001," publisher model at all. So I'm interested in doing things that go more to mass markets,"
4579.280000000001,4584.08," significantly more mass market than we tend to think of as mass market games. And I'm not,"
4584.08,4588.56, and I'm just not really in the mindset of making MMO or RPGs anymore. I'm still interested
4588.64,4593.6," in making online worlds, but I'm really interested in making different kinds of worlds,"
4593.6,4598.240000000001," and then just, uh, MMO or RPGs. So maybe it's like a big like sex chat, Bob."
4599.6,4603.200000000001, That is more mainstream. That's what I'm hoping. That's about as mainstream as you're going to get
4604.64,4609.52," such wide appeal. You heard it here first on TFW radio, RAF Caster is starting a cyber porn site."
4611.52,4615.92," Oh, I'm sorry. It was a joke. I'm just kidding. Should I stop right there? I was going to go, sorry."
4616.0,4619.68," Yeah, you know what? I'm going to, I'm going to edit myself on that one. Yeah."
4620.4800000000005,4624.88," These news items kind of suck this week. Thanks. Thank you. By the way,"
4627.92,4631.2," okay, and by the way, this would happen when you put together the news in like a minute."
4631.92,4635.12," So we get for just saying let's just keep talking until we have no idea. I know. See,"
4635.12,4638.32," we should have stopped. Hey, I had to big talk about AI, but now it's too late."
4638.32,4641.92," It's too late. I'm going to say that one for the next year. I asked Ryan, you've been off the"
4641.92,4646.72," quiet over here. Oh, Ryan's here. All right. Do you have anything to say? This is this is the Ryan Scott"
4646.72,4647.12, minute.
4650.56,4656.88, One. I can't sometimes I can't tell if you're just being quieter for your like angry. Are you
4656.88,4662.72," angry? I'm just going to have much to say today. You know, I'm tired. What are you playing anything?"
4662.72,4667.52, I'm playing Zelda. I'm a game. You're up late. You're not even on the Wii. He's still waiting
4667.52,4670.4, for us with you. I don't have a way. I'm sorry. You're going to go down by thinking. You're a good
4670.48,4677.759999999999," person. Cool. And are you liking it? Zelda. So that's good. Yes. I mean, it's good. You know,"
4677.759999999999,4680.639999999999," it's a good game. So it's always been a good series, but it's, you know,"
4681.759999999999,4687.44," the guy started sort of thing straight up Zelda. It did the same, but that's good. Right. That's what"
4687.44,4690.639999999999," I want. If it was different, I don't, I wouldn't want it to be. You wouldn't be Zelda. You don't"
4690.639999999999,4695.839999999999," get that many of them. I'm the kind of an exciting event. So like, I kind of want the dungeon with the"
4696.8,4700.72," in a way. Like, you know, like, last week we were on here talking about how Splinter"
4700.72,4705.12," Cell, you know, it's just the same game over again and oh, that's kind of boring now. Here,"
4705.12,4709.52," I am talking about Zelda saying, oh, it's cool. But it just came all over again. Because there's"
4709.52,4713.92," such a huge cap. Like we're saying in between releases. Right. There was a, there was a thread"
4713.92,4718.4800000000005, on quarter to three that got started last night about this guy who said that the thread time
4718.4800000000005,4724.400000000001," it was like, it was about World of Warcraft and it says leveling sucks ours. Okay. And it's just"
4724.48,4730.719999999999," rants that goes on and on about like how lame the leveling is. But as you read his post, he has,"
4730.719999999999,4736.879999999999," he has like multiple level 60 characters and he's complaining because it's like the, it"
4736.879999999999,4742.32, is getting from one to six. He's like the same thing over and over again for him. But he's got multiple
4742.32,4746.96," characters. It's like, why did you do it multiple times then? Well, he's now he's the authority on"
4746.96,4751.28," being able to bitch about it. It's just, it's just a crazy thing to me. If you don't like it,"
4751.28,4755.36," why did you play it eight hundred dollars? And maybe I mean, would he have the same complain if you"
4755.36,4759.44," hadn't have done that some times? Well, right. I mean, any game is going to get tiring if you play it"
4759.44,4764.8," 100 times in a row. I read this, I had Moby Dick six times in a row now. He managed to show"
4764.8,4771.12," it a freak out worse. Man, it's boring now. He's still going all over the way. Not to compare. I take that"
4771.12,4775.84, back. I don't want to compare World of Warcraft to Moby Dick. She's a novel-eyed door. World of
4775.84,4781.2, Ishmael. I never read it. You get on it. Like you. Corridor. Carthie's roads real good too.
4781.2,4785.04, Just picked it up. Take us off topic for a minute. Okay. It's literary minute. Yeah.
4786.32,4791.2," What's a very music sound like? Well, I've been playing speaking of literary achievements."
4791.2,4795.68," I've been playing Bookworm Adventures. And I'm telling you, this game is hot."
4795.68,4798.32, Nice. I just downloaded it last night. I didn't have time to play it.
4798.32,4804.16," I don't know. I don't know what Bookworm what Pop Cap does, but I love what. I love everything they do."
4804.16,4809.44," And I actually thought they couldn't what what more could he do with Bookworm? Well, turn it"
4809.44,4817.2," to an action adventure game. So you spell words to to beat bad guys. And not only you beating bad guys,"
4817.2,4820.88, but you're beating them throughout human history. And you feel like invested in this world.
4820.88,4825.84, You're fighting eight off Hitler. So you spell not a part of it. And you're all thinking
4825.84,4830.32, you're funny like ancient Greece. You spell out Texas and it like the words like appear and then like
4830.32,4836.16," beat up the centurion and you're like, oh, don't mess with Texas. Yeah. Yesterday I spelled Revolution."
4836.16,4842.48," And it like totally took the dick out. Wow. That's nice. I know. You're like, oh, oh."
4844.719999999999,4848.08," If any listeners at there can beat Revolution, you let me know."
4848.08,4855.04," That's my high word so far. All right. So Bookworm, I got McConium. You did. Yeah. Damn. That's good."
4855.04,4858.24, You used that on it's some caveman or something? You beat you beat Grock down with
4858.8,4860.24, the
4860.24,4868.16, beat the Persian army. Sometimes it's a little game set like through the most damage to one's productivity.
4868.16,4874.4, Or less I'm a bookworm. Just don't even know the gun you is. So it's going to look it up. That's the joke.
4874.4,4879.12, I didn't do it. I said it to say it. I wanted it is. What is it? I didn't say it. Look it up.
4879.12,4883.84," Waiter. Don't let it out. No, you don't. Is it something file?"
4884.72,4891.2," Probably. It's what I think it is. I kind of like, I don't want to. No, it's nothing."
4891.2,4897.04, Like it's not being in a room. It just carry on. So let them look it up. Okay. So I
4897.04,4902.56, I'd Jeffrey and recommends Bookworm adventures here here. Anybody else playing anything before we
4902.56,4908.400000000001, we tune out for the week. We're wearing that our welcome. Let me see. Let's keep this going.
4908.4,4913.839999999999," Actually, more of a quick shot up in anything else. This game, it's worth checking out. It's"
4913.839999999999,4918.879999999999, totally free. It's called Weekday Warrior. It's an adventure game mod for Half Life 2.
4919.839999999999,4925.12, It was a student project for SMU and it kind of plays like office space meets secret life
4925.12,4929.36," a Walter MIDI meets Metal Gear Solid. Kind of weird combo. Okay. And the humor is kind of,"
4930.0,4933.5199999999995," but it has many games and the whole idea is you're this guy, you know, this loser in an office"
4934.160000000001,4939.040000000001, and you have fantasies of being like a solid snake kind of character. See that disguise
4939.040000000001,4943.4400000000005," treatment all of us. Yeah, it it close to home for me. I mean, it was like, it was like a very,"
4943.4400000000005,4946.64," it was a very, it's a very short game. It's just, you know, a quick hit kind of deal."
4946.64,4950.96," It's a kingman. It's a very, it's a sweet game. It's a sweet game. It's a sweet game. It's a sweet game."
4952.72,4957.52, I saw a commercial for that the other day. It's a sweet game. They have fully acknowledged how creepy it is. Have you seen it?
4957.52,4964.160000000001, Yeah. Yeah. I respect it. You're right. They're just coming out and I don't know. I'm okay with it.
4964.160000000001,4968.160000000001," Yeah. I don't want to play. The wrapping nose I saw review of it and it said that it was, uh,"
4968.88,4974.160000000001," it was a thinly veiled advertisement. No, no, no, no. I don't even know where the veils at. Yeah,"
4974.160000000001,4980.160000000001," where's the veils? Apparently didn't come with my copy. Yeah, because you can only buy it with a"
4980.160000000001,4985.84," frickin' wopper. So yeah, that's true. It's really tough. I wonder what the message with this game is."
4986.8,4992.8," They don't let no. We're out. We're out. Yeah. I think we're out. I got to go record something. No,"
4992.8,4998.88, okay. So this is it for us for 2006. We're gone. It's been a whole year. It's been one hell of a year.
4998.88,5005.28, We've been happy to share it with you. This is it. We'll see you next year. We wish you health and happiness.
5006.32,5013.12," And we'll be back on January, uh, uh, second. I don't know. I wonder back. We'll be back next year."
5013.68,5016.48," Yeah, something like that. We're back sometime around when hellgage ships."
5016.48,5022.16," True. We'll see you in 2007 and 2008. Bye. Bye, everybody."
