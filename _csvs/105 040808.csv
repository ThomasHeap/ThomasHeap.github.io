0.0,13.0," Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. This is Jeff Green, the editor-in-chief of something."
13.0,17.400000000000002," Oh yeah, the online part, the PC part of the online site. That's right. That's what I'm"
17.400000000000002,22.0, editor-in-chief of. And I've got a few other people with me here today. Who are?
22.0,24.0, Rain Scott?
24.0,29.0," Oh, I'm so early. Sean, I'm a lawyer. Hi guys. Hi."
29.0,37.0," So yeah, Papa Jeff. So yeah, here we are. We're podcasting. We're still here. Yeah. That's a good thing."
37.0,40.0," Anyway, well, we're those. See you on next week. Oh, should I explain?"
40.0,46.0," Yeah, yeah. For those that's in the know, I just cop double copies of Mogendigo."
46.0,51.0, Keep it going. That's a quote. All right. So breaking down. I'm sorry.
51.0,58.0," Yeah, we'll break down. We're podcasting here on a April 8th. The news went out a couple hours ago."
58.0,67.0, Now at this point that Jeff W the magazine shut down. It's over. We're gone. Good bye.
67.0,73.0, The issue that was put out on the new stands. A promo issue with the sim3 on the cover has
74.0,86.0, in fact turned out to be our last issue a bit unbeknown to us. So all those awesome articles that we've already written and we're working on.
86.0,93.0," Do fucking bed. Well, no, actually they're going to show the thing. The crazy thing is we are about to ship our next issue."
93.0,100.0," Actually, we were we were in production for the and it's like that issue's not going anywhere. Well, it's going to go online now."
100.0,107.0," Right. I mean, not not in this it's we're not going to just put a digital version of it like a zineal thing, but we're going to re take all the stories."
107.0,113.0," Yes, and you know, find new homes for them on the section on the PC section of one up dot com that we will do digital."
113.0,114.0, We will do digital.
114.0,116.0," Yes, it's a new test to."
116.0,117.0, Yep.
117.0,129.0, To make I can I can tell you because it doesn't really matter anymore that the cover story was on Starcraft 2 because James and Melki and I had gone down there a few weeks ago to play it all day long.
129.0,146.0, I played about this recently again for a second time and he and I had some great great experiences against each other and the AI and so we're going to write it up for your education and pleasure on the website now.
146.0,149.0, You know what I think you should post the cover on your blog.
149.0,150.0, So that's the final cover.
150.0,151.0, Nice cover.
151.0,152.0, The collector's item.
152.0,153.0, Yeah.
153.0,156.0, But we haven't really written the cover lines yet. It's all generic stuff.
156.0,157.0," Yeah, they're all taken."
157.0,161.0, They can pick up people can pick a peek in and see like what it looks like before it.
161.0,168.0," Right. I wish they could actually see our placeholder cover lines which are like, you know, another crappy game preview inside."
168.0,169.0, It's like that.
169.0,170.0, If we had known it in advance.
170.0,172.0, This game will never ship.
172.0,173.0," Yeah, sorry."
173.0,178.0," The final green speak could have just said, well, it's just centered in the middle of the blank page."
178.0,179.0, Yeah.
179.0,181.0, I think get to do a final one of those kind of sucks.
181.0,184.0, We didn't really get to do a goodbye at all.
184.0,187.0," Now, and it would be weird to do it here now on on the podcast."
187.0,189.0, And we're still here.
189.0,191.0, Right. That is right.
191.0,195.0, So that would sort of buy a irrelevant and inappropriate.
195.0,196.0, It's a print goodbye.
196.0,198.0, It's a print goodbye kind.
198.0,203.0," And if we send a little flip or whatever,"
203.0,210.0, he just have to understand and and bear with us that we're we're having a little bit of a galos humor.
210.0,213.0," Because in fact, it's a pretty fucking bad day for us here."
213.0,223.0," So there's multiple factors. There's the survivors killed, but that that rose Mary and Michael Jennings are, you know, they've been laid off today."
223.0,225.0," And right, we have our staff."
225.0,227.0," Yeah, you know, they're close friends with them."
227.0,229.0, They've worked with them for years.
229.0,233.0," And I mean, just this group effort to put out the magazine."
233.0,235.0, And it's like just it's just in the past few months.
235.0,238.0, I feel that like it's over the past few years.
238.0,241.0," I mean, we've been sort of shaping the magazine."
241.0,244.0," And you know, taking it in a certain direction."
244.0,247.0, And there's always this lag I think with public perception.
247.0,253.0, And part of it is you just have to you have to teach your own horn in order for people to respect something.
253.0,257.0," You know, it's telling Sean, like you could have a really righteous person, you know,"
257.0,258.0," you know, I'm not being ironic."
258.0,261.0," You have a very, you know, righteous person who does nothing."
261.0,263.0, Draws no attention to his or herself.
263.0,264.0, No one will say anything about it.
264.0,267.0, But then you can get someone who's like a tell of Angela's or something.
267.0,269.0, And it's constantly drawing attention to what it is that
269.0,271.0," how or, you know, here she is living."
271.0,277.0," And then people are much more likely to come to regard that person as this paragon of righteousness, you know."
277.0,279.0," And so here, I mean, it could be anything."
279.0,281.0," I mean, not righteous."
281.0,283.0," I just use a pick a, you know, pick a random example."
283.0,287.0," But for us, it was like, just keep doing what we're doing."
287.0,290.0, Have the conviction say we're going to do these stories.
290.0,294.0," And we're going to, you know, this is the editorial, you know, that we're going to pursue."
294.0,298.0," Because we're absolutely, you know, convinced that this, this is good stuff."
298.0,303.0," And then it's just recently that we're starting to get so much good feedback from, you know,"
303.0,304.0," our readers, people in the industry."
304.0,307.0," And it's like every day, just talking to different people."
307.0,309.0," It comes up over and over again, like, oh, God."
309.0,313.0," I mean, in the weirdest places, you know, I mean, and finally, just to have,"
313.0,316.0," it's like, it's, it's paying off, you know, and then now it's like,"
316.0,317.0," yeah, it's very true."
317.0,320.0," I mean, you're, you're, I totally agree with that."
320.0,321.0," I mean, we, we, we,"
322.0,323.0," we, we, we,"
323.0,328.0," toiled for a long time to sort of change directions and to, to respond to what we felt were deficiencies in,"
328.0,334.0," in game magazines, as, as well as, you know, new things we had to deal with because of the internet."
334.0,338.0," And, and we felt like we sort of got it and then, you know,"
338.0,340.0, weren't reaping much of it.
340.0,343.0," And then all of a sudden, in the last few months, there's been sort of this, like,"
343.0,347.0," avalanche of, of, uh, good, well, coming our way."
347.0,350.0," And now right at this point where we feel like we were really on a roll,"
350.0,354.0," and I, I think you guys probably agree with me that that sims three issue was was awesome."
354.0,360.0," Actually, think the, the last three, I think the demo I got won the battlefield heroes won and the sims won."
360.0,364.0," Like, yeah, every time I've picked up and read one of them after, you know,"
364.0,369.0," the necessary amount of time required to recover it from it after the, you know, horrible deadline."
369.0,370.0, Sure.
370.0,373.0," Because usually, I'll, I'll, we'll finish an issue in the last thing I want to do is look at it,"
373.0,374.0, let me get her a copy.
374.0,377.0," Yeah, I can't, oh my god, I remember that night."
378.0,380.0," But look, what I do get past that period."
380.0,381.0, I'll three of those.
381.0,383.0," I went on, when I finally did go back to them."
383.0,385.0," I was like, this was an awesome issue."
385.0,386.0," Yeah, I'm three in a row."
386.0,389.0," I mean, yeah, I love that feeling when we get it back and you look through it and you're like,"
389.0,392.0," okay, what if I had received this in the mail and I'm flipping through it,"
392.0,396.0," my immediate sense is like, okay, there's, it's like when I get, you know,"
396.0,399.0," like, my favorite magazines when I pick, you know, I don't want to compare."
399.0,402.0," You know, it was like the Atlantic of gaming or something, but when I get a magazine like"
402.0,404.0," did Lanark or something, I flip through it and say,"
405.0,410.0," wow, like, I anticipate reading all these things and like I just need to pick the order that I'm going to, you know,"
410.0,415.0," approach it in and it's not quite the same as, you know, when you look at a maxim or a stuff or something like that."
415.0,418.0," A lot of gaming magazines where you pick it up and you're like,"
418.0,422.0," I know that if I start looking at it now by the time this, I get off of this boss,"
422.0,425.0, I will be finished with this in its entirety.
425.0,429.0," I mean, there's something to be said for that, but I mean, I don't know."
429.0,433.0," I was, I was basically pretty proud whenever our baby would come back each month and we'd see."
433.0,438.0," Like, I hope it was a tour of come across like rare again to anything."
438.0,441.0," At this point, there's no professional pride."
441.0,445.0, Let's just have to allow our professional pride on the day that we were shut down.
445.0,449.0," And yeah, I mean, like, anyone who can't if we weren't proud of what we were doing,"
449.0,450.0, we shouldn't have been doing it.
450.0,455.0," I mean, we, I think every, only good things come from, you know, that passion and that"
455.0,460.0," reaction that you are doing something that's worth pursuing instead of we're just doing it because this is how the world works,"
460.0,465.0," because there is a press event and the story has to be covered or this has to be said,"
465.0,468.0, this has to be reviewed because it came out this week.
468.0,471.0," I mean, it's like, I mean, I found reasons for myself."
471.0,474.0," You know, it's an editor for all this stuff in the front of the book for, you know,"
474.0,475.0, features and stories and stuff.
475.0,480.0," So like, how am I going to keep myself from burning out and from feeling like it's the tool?"
480.0,484.0," And, and so yeah, I mean, that's part of what I'm bummed out about."
484.0,486.0," Right. I mean, I, I, I, girth, you know, there."
486.0,489.0," I mean, I've been doing this for 10 years."
489.0,495.0," It's 10 years of CGW and certainly after that amount of time, you know, my tolerance for a lot of bullshit."
495.0,501.0," I mean, even, you know, bullshit that the mag might have done in the past had just so passed."
501.0,504.0," You know, there's just certain things I just didn't want to do anymore."
504.0,509.0, There were certain kind of articles I didn't want to write or read about anymore.
509.0,512.0," I just felt like, I felt like, you know,"
512.0,514.0, you complain about the shit all the time.
514.0,516.0, So let's do something about it in print.
516.0,518.0, And I felt like we really had.
518.0,520.0," It's, show me."
520.0,521.0, Sorry.
521.0,522.0, I don't know.
522.0,526.0," It's interesting to see that, I mean, there's, you know, various threads on the internet."
526.0,530.0, And it's awesome to get all the support from from the people that did read our magazine.
530.0,532.0, And that's fantastic.
532.0,534.0," But then in the same threads, there's a number of other things."
534.0,537.0," I think we, we all have some reaction to."
537.0,541.0, And one of them before we get to the podcast itself is just that there's a lot of
541.0,544.0, misconception as to what the mag even was.
544.0,546.0, And it was really frustrating.
546.0,549.0," It's really frustrating, for example, to read a post."
549.0,551.0," It's like, well, this is just how it is."
551.0,553.0, We can get all this news online.
553.0,556.0," And it's like, you, they just can't keep up and say, well,"
556.0,560.0," you didn't read the magazine them because it, we were not about saying,"
560.0,565.0," hey, you know, this is, this is the preview that, you know, you're going to read here first."
565.0,567.0," I mean, there would be some of that with cover stories and stuff."
567.0,570.0," I mean, it's, and that looks like as much business decisions anything."
571.0,575.0," All the other stuff in the book, and then even the way the approach that we took to reviews,"
575.0,580.0," the columns, you know, the stuff that worked that, you know, all of our freelancers do."
580.0,585.0," I mean, it's just, it was not the magazine that existed that we just that ended today."
585.0,588.0, It's not what they're representing in their post.
588.0,593.0, But then it was great to see all the people that that clearly do read it and we're subscribers.
593.0,598.0," Just vindicating all the decisions we made, you know, as much as the,"
598.0,601.0, the fact that we're closed down as kind of says that we did their own things.
601.0,602.0, I don't know.
602.0,606.0, And then there's let's go to the podcast thing.
606.0,609.0," The other, it's like, you see the majority of it's like, oh, that's a barber,"
609.0,611.0, but great. The podcast is still around.
611.0,612.0," And it's like, that is a good thing."
612.0,617.0," And the same reason absolutely thankful to have our, our jobs and not only that,"
617.0,620.0," to have a position to all the stuff that we were, that I'm talking about."
620.0,622.0, It's like far from over.
622.0,625.0," And on the positive side, it's going to be available immediately online."
625.0,629.0," You don't have to be subscriber. You can hear us talk about something on the podcast and it's like,"
629.0,634.0," boom, that very day, you know, we could put up a story. We can react to things."
634.0,638.0," Right. I mean, again, in the, in the horned shooting department,"
638.0,642.0, and you just gotta forgive us for this one week for us doing this.
642.0,648.0," But, you know, imagine, you know, the place you worked at, you know, or the thing you worked on had shut down."
648.0,651.0," So we're just, we're just indulging today."
651.0,656.0," But, you know, the fact that they closed down the magazine, but, you know, they kept the four of us."
656.0,662.0, And they've put the four of us in pretty key positions online and the four of us are going to work together still as a team.
662.0,665.0," You know, it's pretty cool, you know, relatively."
665.0,667.0," I mean, it's very cool."
667.0,677.0, And we know that the kind of changes that we started making to the magazine are the things that we're going to be pursuing on oneup.com as well.
677.0,684.0," And hopefully we can, you know, convince our listeners to read those as well. I mean, that was part of the frustration when I bring up that you've got the podcast to still around."
684.0,692.0," The thing is that we come in with no preparation whatsoever and then it's deprives for an hour each week and that gets more, you know, about lost feedback."
692.0,700.0," Yeah, about comments and stuff. Then then, you know, an entire month worth of work that's not just our work, but, you know, all of our wonderful freelancers, our artists, you know,"
701.0,709.0," illustrators that work with us and like, oh, because when you look at all that labor that's invisible to our listeners, it's like a magazine just comes out and if you read it and you know, a few hours."
709.0,717.0," It's like, you know, like a comic book or a movie or something, people might have spent like three years working on something that you can consume in, you know, 20 minutes."
717.0,718.0, Yeah.
718.0,719.0, Yeah.
719.0,724.0," And then it's just like, yeah, the podcast is pretty easy to make if that paid the bills."
724.0,725.0, Yeah.
726.0,743.0," Well, it's what I, you know, I think that about the game industry itself, you know, that that, you know, some AAA game or whatever, you know, taking years and years to work and you're talking about hundreds of man hours of all these different artists, you know, programmers, 3D graphics and all the support staff and all that to get this game out."
743.0,748.0," All that effort and then, you know, we look at it and you know, and 200 words were like, what a piece of shit."
749.0,756.0," And then, you know, and then they can go ahead and make a casual game, just sort of like we can casually do the podcast and get kudos for that."
756.0,761.0," I mean, you got to wonder if some of these game companies are just like, fuck it with these AAA games, just make the next big joke."
761.0,762.0, Jesus.
762.0,763.0, Nice.
763.0,764.0, Yeah.
764.0,766.0, So.
766.0,774.0," I mean, going forward, this is the trick is like, we have this chance now because we have a section on the website."
774.0,790.0," The key because part of the good thing, you know, that we're, we're talking about is with the magazine, we're able to really develop a voice and to maintain, you know, a standard across all the pages and that book and we can perhaps do something of the same sort because hopefully we can."
790.0,801.0," That's not going up, but because one ups a very big site and there are that many more voices and there's no single overriding, you know, there's no core group of people that are saying this exactly what things are going to be like."
801.0,804.0," So, you can see, you know, if you can't have any of these, you know, you know, you've got to take a break."
804.0,805.0," You know, you can see."
805.0,807.0," You know, you've got to think in a few other things like that, you know, we're going to be able to do that."
807.0,813.0," But the thing is, is we got to get people to click on that thing, because right now a lot of people go to the front page of the site, but they don't go to the PC thing and we want to, we're going to need to give reasons for you guys."
813.0,817.0," And over the next coming weeks, you'll start seeing them, you know, right, give you reasons for it."
817.0,819.0," But you're right with the magazine, he said."
819.0,828.0," We had it, if this like controlled hundred pages that was ours to shape it and mold, and we could lose anything that didn't fit our tone or fit our ideals."
828.0,838.14," Right, I mean, with all due respect to all the people who work on that website, there isn't that kind of unified voice, you know at this point, you know, so how how we adapt"
838.68,846.18, You know the GFW feel whatever right to to that side is something that's still kind of we can have a good mix
846.18,852.2, It may be seen I mean the spontaneity that we have with the podcast. I mean there's this one side of us and then
852.2,856.56, But something I don't want to lose about the magazine is it like when you look now. I mean there's just this natural
856.56,859.56, Trends of you know things go online and
861.16,868.66, But when you get the immediacy and you know all the knee jerk reactions and just the spontaneity online. I mean you risk
869.04,870.54, Absolutely missing
870.54,876.3599999999999," The more measured and studied looks at topics, you know when people say let's research this let's talk to it"
876.3599999999999,880.92, Let's get gather you know information for multiple sources and put together a proper story
881.4799999999999,886.1999999999999, That it's kind of like the way that Atlantic survives now in New York or you know it's like instead of saying you know
886.1999999999999,891.8, We're not gonna be you're not gonna try to keep up with the blogs and stuff that we're going to come at it with you know with this angle
891.8,898.4399999999999, I think that there's still a place for those stories online and I still want to see those there alongside
898.92,905.56, The quick things that are responding like to minute by minute difference in the game. I think it is gonna be a challenge for us though to
906.12,910.8399999999999, You know get people to want to because I just know my own personal feeling
910.92,914.4799999999999, Like I have a hard time reading like super long stories on the web exactly
915.68,920.8399999999999, So how do we deal with that I think it's gonna be one of our challenges right? I mean you're talking about the challenge of
921.92,926.36," us within one up, but then you know we're also within the internet itself"
926.36,930.36, Like our stories to a lot of eyeballs will exist as one off entities
930.5999999999999,934.76, So you know I'm trying to step those in the context of the internet right
935.92,940.8399999999999," Yeah, that gets you know, yeah, it's like listening to you know when to say if you're a musician and you put together an album"
940.92,947.56," And it's very much like composed as an album, you know, as a collection of songs that like resonate with one another and then"
947.88,953.56, The single goes on the radio or maybe there's two singles and it's like it's still cool. I'm glad you're listening to the single
953.56,956.12, But you know when you look at all in the context you
956.68,960.92, Not that it's like it you know an average issue of GFW is always a symphony or something
961.4799999999999,966.56, But there is like you do see you do see that it's the work of of like minded people with you know
967.1199999999999,971.8399999999999," And editor, you know editorial oversight that's keeping it you know together"
971.8399999999999,975.56," Yeah, the other thing is like you're saying like reading long things on the internet"
975.56,978.9599999999999, This is what's always been weird to me. It's like a lot of current magazines
979.68,983.3599999999999, Take the maximum approach and that's let's put a bunch of you know
983.3599999999999,989.3, Let's assume that the world has lost its attention span and let's put a bunch of these little things that you read and
989.3,995.76, No single entry takes more than a minute to read and you just hop back and forth through them and it's like meanwhile online
995.76,1002.12, You see just these reviews that are like you know four and five pages long and it always struck me as completely backwards
1002.12,1008.16, Because I have like a vast attention span when I'm reading you know printed material
1008.16,1013.16, I could just sit and read a book for hours and hours and it not even get up and then online
1013.16,1018.84," I don't want to sit and do any really heavy, you know the online environment even cultivates it"
1018.84,1022.0, Because within one article you'll have one paragraph with like
1022.72,1028.04, Multiple words linked that's basically inviting you to like yeah in the middle of the sentence go read something else
1028.04,1030.76," Yeah, like that's just how right the internet works"
1030.76,1036.08," Well, these like eight page longer views that you see on certain websites, you know for gaming. I mean I to me"
1036.08,1038.08, That's just a matter of
1038.08,1044.92, There we don't have a word count just say what the hell you want which of course then to me is also saying we don't
1045.44,1049.88, Either we're not good editors or you know we're you know
1049.88,1050.88, You know
1050.88,1054.5600000000002, I don't know I think there's a lot to be said for more succinct
1055.24,1057.24, tax I would rather read
1057.24,1063.8600000000001," Spat I'm talking about reviews in particular, you know I would rather read a succinct to the point but but you know"
1067.16,1072.68, Intelligent thought for short thought provoking short review then an eight page long
1073.6000000000001,1075.6000000000001, So the graphics
1075.6,1079.52, There's a difference like short is not always is better either. It's like if you're using now
1079.52,1083.9199999999998, It's I mean if you're using that same amount of space to just say the same thing the controls are tight
1083.9199999999998,1087.9199999999998," The graphics, you know all this other stuff right make sure you use the word compelling word gritty"
1088.9199999999998,1092.8799999999999," Your it doesn't it's really no different if it's long or short, you know, but that's true"
1092.8799999999999,1096.6399999999999, I mean the whole thing is let let your content determine the length
1096.6399999999999,1101.04, I mean what do you need to say and and is everything you're saying worth being said or are you just babbling?
1101.04,1106.6," Well, I just think that the downside of the web is that that that ability to babble"
1107.6,1110.04, It is it's it's too easy. It's too there
1110.04,1114.56, You know if you don't have it a sign word count because you don't need one because there's no paper limitation
1115.12,1120.84, That it can it can just lead to that kind of sloppy lazy writing where I'm just gonna say every damn thing
1120.84,1125.52, I have to say without processing at first right and then there's the other the other
1125.52,1129.8, The other part of that challenge is knowing where you know if it's going to end up on the internet
1129.8,1130.8, There's this
1130.8,1135.16," Chew through a media see that you part of you is like well, it'll be buried in a day anyway"
1135.36,1139.1," So like yeah, I'm not gonna put as much effort into this article as I would in this"
1139.6399999999999,1140.36, I
1140.36,1144.48, That was just forever. It's funny. I honestly worry about that with my own writing going forward
1144.48,1147.8, I was gonna be I wonder how you guys feel about this too that
1148.8,1153.28," I definitely like sweat, you know bullets over the over the GFW stuff, you know"
1153.28,1158.24, I'm late because I'm like crafting the sentences because I feel like it's gonna be in print
1158.24,1163.0, Then it's gonna live and I want to be able to look at it five years from now and not be embarrassed at what I wrote
1163.0,1167.5, But the thing is but it really is easier for people to look at your archive material online
1168.86,1174.68, But on my blog even when I wrote that sport right up which was not a blog
1174.68,1176.48, It was actually like a news article or whatever
1176.48,1180.12, I felt like I don't have to try as hard because it's just online
1180.3999999999999,1185.8799999999999," So I'm just gonna sort of write up my head though. Yeah, and you have to add down the very next morning right"
1185.8799999999999,1187.8799999999999, Whereas mine which appeared in the magazine
1187.8799999999999,1192.84," I didn't I had like the rest of the week to work on it. I mean, it's not like I spent an entire week working on it"
1192.84,1195.3999999999999, But I was able to think about it sure that's an important part
1195.3999999999999,1199.6599999999999," I think allowing you to you know like I just did this, you know, pre-the-of-nature guidance"
1199.6599999999999,1203.32, It was like if I've gone to an event the night before and I had to get it in that night
1203.32,1206.12, So that it would the moment that bargo lifted the next morning
1206.9199999999998,1209.6, It would have been different because I played the game
1209.6,1212.2399999999998, I played the preview and then I thought about it for a couple days
1212.3999999999999,1214.76, It was like what is it like what is it in this game?
1214.76,1217.84, I'm noticing and then like that govern to what I wrote
1218.28,1221.62, You know finding some themes and there and stuff and I mean that that's the thing
1221.62,1228.9199999999998, It's when when you you're basically your deadlines are being dictated by companies that want the press that just want the the free advertising
1229.4799999999998,1233.6399999999999, I mean that's another story and that's something that we're gonna have to find ways to now
1233.64,1238.0200000000002, I mean that basically this is what this podcast turning out is like us sort of thinking out loud
1238.0200000000002,1240.0200000000002, about people saying our editor's
1240.0200000000002,1245.0," Yeah, you know facing transition and then we've got to get those clicks on we got to get the clicks"
1245.64,1248.5200000000002," Yeah, just you know need those page for you Sean"
1249.8400000000001,1252.8400000000001, And that's another thing for like I mean our audience
1252.8400000000001,1256.0200000000002, I mean if you do if you're listening you're like this is cool. I agree with this
1256.0200000000002,1259.8400000000001, I don't want to read I want to read more than just you know
1260.36,1263.9599999999998," lists every every single day of the week, you know"
1263.9599999999998,1266.9399999999998, You have to click these stories and you have to at least support them otherwise
1267.34,1269.58, What happens is online?
1269.58,1272.6799999999998, You get to this point where like we have to I mean it happens print too
1272.6799999999998,1277.58, But it's more accelerated on line where like what did well people like what we need if we're gonna get ads
1277.58,1281.54, We have to have have page views and what's been generating page views so far
1281.54,1286.3," Well, let's just do that again. How do we add a new vehicle to what's been successful and where's like"
1286.82,1291.9199999999998, My whole approach I keep I maintain my sanity and do this as a career because I say
1292.6399999999999,1297.72," I find something that's interesting to me or a freelancer, you know pitch is something and I'm like I'm totally behind this"
1297.72,1302.86, I want to go ahead with this because I think that I can convince other people that this is worth examining
1302.86,1309.98, You know rather than like trying to play the stock market with stories and just assign people things that none of us care and the least bit about
1309.98,1314.94, But simply because we think it's gonna get clicks and then you got to get 20 thousand more clicks today
1314.94,1317.5800000000002, What do you got for me and the people what do you got for me?
1317.5800000000002,1321.42, It might just be like you know my child five best villains
1321.94,1326.42," Dig yes, you got for me keep going. This is like the perfect background point"
1326.42,1329.94," So, so they're like you know you see something on dig and you're like I can check that out"
1329.94,1335.5800000000002, And then you just look and see the list and then you close it and those list can be fun. You know they can be well done
1335.74,1337.5, So I don't want to like you know
1337.5,1343.6200000000001, I'm sure we'll continue to do some but it's like I want I want to bounce and I want to offer a variety right of things
1343.62,1346.2399999999998, It's like if it gets the point where that's all that we're
1346.8799999999999,1349.78," Yeah, right and that that is the challenge for the challenge because"
1350.4599999999998,1354.58, On the internet you can get that immediate feedback like if you do know this article did well
1354.58,1358.9399999999998, You can capitalize with in the next day right. We're you know print like we don't know
1359.58,1365.3," An issue tanked for months and months and yeah, we don't know what specifically"
1365.58,1371.5," That's right or what caused it's tank. Yeah, where's this? It's like per hour per page"
1372.02,1377.14," It's in the way they take those yeah, I mean the what I mean all four of us who are in that meeting"
1377.14,1382.18," You know, we all all of us here in the podcast sat in the meeting where we were given a lesson in in"
1382.94,1390.1, This program that allows people here at one up and I guess every website to like drill down into the exact numbers
1390.1,1396.3, Of what you know what pages people were looking at in all sorts of different that came from where they came from
1396.3,1401.42, What what what they looked at between 11 and 12 or how many times they went to
1401.5,1405.3, The article whatever and it was crazy to me not just the ability to do it
1405.98,1409.82, But how important it that message seemed to be
1410.02,1414.86, You know what was so scary. I mean I think it's exactly what you're saying Sean that like if if if
1415.06,1420.06," If a website starts taking that stuff so seriously, it's just like well yesterday the"
1420.34,1425.7, The top five fat-escene characters got 10 times more clicks in every other story
1425.7,1430.38, So today do top thinnest characters you know it's gonna it's just gonna be
1430.38,1435.0600000000002, You know a validation of of doing like puff pieces
1435.0600000000002,1439.14, You know parallels and in all their media is like music when you have like
1439.66,1444.7, Artificially constructed boy bands and things like yes and down to pop songs that are like
1445.74,1452.14, Like almost generated by a machine sure to you know sound close enough to other ones and to like you know
1452.14,1457.46, I hate all these various things that someone that perhaps studies the cognition of you know like right musical perception
1457.9,1459.9, The create these harmonies
1460.7,1465.0200000000002," Oh, so what I was gonna say was like they brought up the maybe not in this meaning bit in another one"
1465.0200000000002,1473.8200000000002, We started putting the Tom versus Bruce articles online very popular calm in in the print magazine and we're putting the old ones up there now
1473.98,1477.7," We started with not to very first one, but near the first one"
1477.7,1483.98," And so there have been about three online now for four, okay, and I was in a meeting where somebody was saying like you know"
1483.98,1488.3000000000002," They're just not getting that many clicks, you know people just aren't looking at those the next"
1488.54,1492.1399999999999," Question then being will should we keep doing it? Yeah, you know"
1492.1399999999999,1497.1," They were immediately saying well, maybe we just shouldn't have put these up there and to me it was it was"
1498.1399999999999,1500.1399999999999, Almost like an appallingly
1500.46,1503.1, reactionary move yeah
1503.1,1507.02, For many reasons I mean one I mean I think it's a worthwhile question
1507.4199999999998,1511.58," I'm thinking of this based on the age I mean the time we miss of them. Well, yeah, there is"
1511.58,1515.18, And this net but but the other thing is that back to what I was saying
1515.26,1522.38," There's always this I think there's just this lag for good things to catch on, you know, yeah, I mean very rarely is something"
1523.5,1527.8200000000002, Like a universal hit the moment that it that it's introduced or that something comes out
1527.8200000000002,1531.1000000000001, I mean you have to just have faith and it keep going and just you know
1531.1000000000001,1533.8200000000002, I'm convinced that this is worthwhile and
1535.02,1540.54," We'll just keep doing it, you know, and I mean just like say if someone whatever someone likes if someone listen to GFW radio or something"
1541.1000000000001,1542.3, And they're like yeah
1542.3799999999999,1546.06, Whatever whatever whatever whatever and then at one point someone's like you know what I like this I like listening to it
1546.06,1551.02, But then it's not like the episode before that there was some radical change in it or something that it just got better
1551.02,1555.5," I mean even though you know things are changing like that, but if you just cut it if you're like in this is stupid"
1555.74,1559.74, Maybe it was just the week that Ryan like went off on some like epic lost rant
1560.1399999999999,1562.1399999999999, So that's why they like it now
1562.46,1569.1," Yeah, I might for for time versus both might just be like the game that they know is what they're talking about because those columns are very specific"
1569.4199999999998,1576.06, Right like they're they talk great deal about mechanics and make you know right with the Nick jokes based on the mechanics of the game
1576.06,1578.54, Which if you don't understand sometimes completely
1580.1399999999999,1584.78, And it's the genre that you're into exactly so it's gonna be dependent week for week
1584.78,1590.3799999999999, I mean one article may get some big huge spike in the number of clicks because it happened to be whatever
1590.78,1592.3799999999999, Starcraft one or something
1592.3799999999999,1598.6999999999998, It just what was scaring me was like the the availability of those metrics that they're so close
1599.4199999999998,1605.6599999999999, And the ability to react to them so fast like it would just easy to just say let's just do this. I was not working
1606.54,1608.2199999999998, Rather than take the time
1608.2199999999998,1612.86, This was on the different skill with like just cover stories for the magazine
1613.4199999999998,1617.74, You know I mean where it's like only you know world of warcraft covers
1618.86,1627.02, Would really have excellent returns right get new stand click through God. I got to say man two more of those and like I believe that every time we did one
1627.02,1630.3799999999999, It we really delivered on it. We made it. Yep. Wow awesome
1630.3799999999999,1633.5, And then the the other side is this weird perception that the magazine
1634.22,1640.62, That all we were doing was basically world of warcraft monthly which is hilarious because of course if if you subscribe and really read it
1640.62,1645.5, You know that right aside from like what we did two covers two covers in the GFW
1645.5,1650.06," It's and it might come up here and there there might be a column in the back, but it's like that's it, you know"
1650.06,1653.02, It's really and it wasn't will work out fundamentally in the least bit
1653.9,1657.9, I guess I just taking attention on perception
1658.06,1664.54, It does I do have to say it is a great relief nothing else feels like a relief to me and in what happened today
1664.54,1670.06, It feels like a big fucking bad bummer but to not have to have these arguments
1670.78,1677.34, About what goes on our cover anymore. I mean amongst ourselves. I mean with the people above us right to not have to go through that bullshit anymore
1677.74,1682.54, Thank fucking God there were many things that we wanted for our covers that
1683.1,1689.5, Because again because what's go sell and like there's a conviction then it wasn't gonna I mean there was you know people were convinced it was gonna sell
1689.5,1694.22, So I kind of wish there was like a two or three right right
1695.1,1701.42, Would have been nice if there's a few day period where it actually wasn't out yet that we were closing and we could have just said yes to every
1701.42,1706.78, Laymas cover offer we bit we get in the mail the time what have been great to just right back and go yeah
1707.34,1709.34," Okay, July it's yours"
1709.9,1711.9, You're on
1713.02,1715.02, Yeah
1715.18,1717.18," That's mean Jeff yeah, it's kind of mean"
1718.3799999999999,1721.58, Flat out bad it to get to take it out on someone today
1722.46,1725.5, Take it the entire game industry is who decided to take it out
1727.42,1730.1399999999999, Ryan what do you have to say about all this today? Are you feeling?
1731.34,1733.34, All right
1733.34,1737.1, This is this gotta be tough for you because this is like because I've been through
1737.82,1739.42, magazine closing I had
1739.5,1744.6200000000001, Completely different jobs so but for you this is like this was like your first real job right
1745.26,1749.26," This yeah, I mean my first job not retail"
1750.0600000000002,1755.5, Right so the very first job you had that was not retail you fucked it up how does that feel?
1755.5,1757.5, Hey hang
1757.5,1759.8200000000002, What every place I have ever worked
1761.02,1765.5800000000002, Like my reason for leaving or might you know we're moving on whatever is closed
1766.54,1770.46, You could have told that before I've killed every place I've worked
1770.46,1773.02," Yeah, it's changed that didn't come up in your interview"
1773.98,1775.98, So you can just go ahead and blame me for all this
1777.1799999999998,1779.1799999999998, It's Sean and I've both
1780.1399999999999,1785.6599999999999, This was like the you know saying this was like the first time I got to be one of the survivors that was feeling guilty
1786.3799999999999,1789.34, Rather than one of the one of the people had not the door
1789.8999999999999,1790.8999999999999, Hmm
1790.8999999999999,1794.54," Can't talk too much about it, but we were involved in the project called game star"
1794.86,1796.86, Why can't you talk about it?
1796.86,1798.1399999999999, What it is it like I don't know
1798.1399999999999,1803.6599999999999, There's not much to talk about it. It's just was ridiculous and the way it ended was like he said and it was
1804.86,1806.86, How many issues did you guys put out super surreal
1807.98,1809.26, Three four
1809.26,1813.5, I can't remember and then was it like a one day you got to boot sort of thing well it was like when I
1814.22,1820.54, They kind of fed a similar track it like like was you know 12 issues and then it went down to eight per year
1820.54,1827.02," Which was you know sounds pretty similar, but you were on like issue two when this happened right it was three issue three days"
1827.02,1829.02, We're working on four and
1829.02,1831.02, We were working on the fourth one
1831.18,1837.58, So that'll take them and never so when they slash you from from 12-eight issues a year before you're done working on your fourth issue
1837.58,1838.94, That's
1838.94,1840.94, That's I
1841.5,1847.1000000000001, Confession is like you know when I I got that job. I never like really moved in my cube
1847.8200000000002,1852.14, You know I never brought it just because you knew because I knew I knew that was coming
1852.14,1855.5, And I was like I just gonna have to pack anything I bring in here
1856.22,1860.14," No, it didn't work big but they were like you know they called you into HR and they're like"
1861.18,1864.46, Magazine's closing you got a leave and I was like all right. I just grabbed my bag
1865.5,1867.5, My computer all day later
1868.46,1871.5, But that was part of the other things you were just
1872.06,1876.7, Desperately trying to figure out how to make a magazine and enthusiast gaming magazine work and
1877.02,1883.18, Part of the solution there was to put Titi on it and on everything maybe that was our problem here with GFW
1883.18,1887.42, It wasn't because it not enough Titi well the Titi it was basically it looked like I mean
1887.42,1893.26, I'm sure some of the whatever some of the tense subscribers were suspicious that maybe we were convincing our sisters to like
1893.74,1897.42, Where there swim suits and appear in our magazine or something because it was just like random ass
1898.46,1903.66," I mean not that I don't have like you know not like not not to knock you know like random random girls, but just"
1904.3,1908.46, It was if you're trying to sell like this magazine based on so they were like four three
1908.7,1915.82," Models yeah, but they weren't even really modest. It was like the kind who like posed with like boxes of software Barbazon dropout"
1918.62,1922.54, What do you always call like the tram girls from daily city girls?
1923.26,1928.06, cities is a server Cisco the the model choice kind of
1929.02,1931.02, Had some daily city to it
1933.1,1940.7, Well we had our we had our vampire cover back in CGW's days legendary the legendary vampire cover so we had hired this model
1941.26,1944.22, to come in we were we were doing a story on
1944.86,1948.06, Activision's vampire the masquerade game and
1949.18,1951.9, and that was at a time when you know
1953.58,1957.74, One of the many times when the magazine industry was you know going through like what do we you know?
1957.74,1959.26, What's good what gonna sell?
1959.26,1964.86, It kind of sheds and you know we had like three D renders of anonymous vampires from this game
1965.18,1971.1," Which just looked like you know, but so we didn't want to put those on the cover and so in that this was like in the"
1971.1,1977.02, Hate-day of maximum and things like that when those things were really taken off and so I'm not gonna name names of my former
1977.5,1981.34," My former editors, but they had this brilliant idea of like you know"
1981.4199999999998,1984.3799999999999, Let's do a maximum stock cover. Let's get some hot chick
1984.86,1988.62, Dressed her up like a vampire and you know put the words bite me
1989.5,1995.1, Let's actually the cover like on the cover. So that's what we did so this just poor woman came over
1996.9399999999998,1998.9399999999998, Some modeling agency
1999.1,2003.8999999999999, The dresser up and this horribly fucking ugly vampire makeup and
2005.1799999999998,2007.1, Little none little none anecdote
2007.1799999999998,2011.1799999999998, Factoid of that day she had deathly bad stomach flu
2012.62,2016.78, That's what she was pale so in the middle of the photo shoot this day-long photo shoot
2016.78,2019.02, She was they would take breaks or she could vomit
2019.34,2022.9399999999998, So which was which was nice for shadow that is she did
2022.9399999999998,2027.82, And it also has the whole vibe of like you know like the loser to party trying to like hit on the girl
2027.82,2033.74, But you can you know right so so you know so we put this cover out and it was just so I mean
2034.14,2038.54," Not only was a cover bad, but even if you looked at all the photos that came back like they picked up"
2038.54,2039.9, Particularly bad one
2039.9,2046.06," Um, do that shit was better than than some of the stuff in in our magazine really have you seen the bite me covered"
2047.18,2051.34, Have you seen fuck you have you seen the game stars tutorials
2052.06,2057.98, The great thing was like the great thing was like how betrayed and angry like active vision was too like they were like
2058.22,2063.26," Because this was computer gaming world, you know, we had this like story venerable sort of you know"
2063.82,2069.7, Grandfather Dean of gaming turtles and right and vampire series is like really like you had a bite
2069.7,2076.14, Take a gul and and rice goth and like yes vampire porn at all is right and then we we made the
2076.38,2078.38, easiest most low brow
2078.62,2080.14, Pandering piece of shit
2080.14,2085.7400000000002, Max and stop cover and they were just like what the fuck like we gave you all this game art and this is what you did
2085.9799999999996,2092.3799999999997, Then they were so mad that was all the rage forever was like you know so many different magazines that one got Stevie case to pose
2092.3799999999997,2100.74," Oh, yeah, it's like an oddity teacher right there was that out of the accelerator. I think there was that yeah, and then there was the one that Darren worked on what was that insight"
2101.14,2104.8199999999997, Insights that was a thing. That's what was so bizarre about gay star US
2105.14,2107.14, It was like really
2107.14,2113.6," Yeah, I'm trying to do all the shit like fail like fucking five years. Right that was the idea that you could do like a mainstream a"
2113.6,2121.2799999999997, mainstream game magazine by yeah by putting girls and cars and in it or what you remember you remember that article that we did with a
2121.7999999999997,2128.8199999999997, A former CGW editor who posed a bunch of a bunch of gaming fairfaroats and stuff with a bunch of models. Yeah
2128.8199999999997,2134.3199999999997," What was the theme of that? Well, that was before my day. Oh my god that I was in the building"
2134.3199999999997,2139.88," I was at E. J. M. He was like could have built like the ultimate game room gaming. Yeah, does that what it was?"
2139.88,2147.3, And he had like a huge desk and all the like all these like joistics and like monitors and stuff all this fancy shit
2147.3,2151.04, And like a bunch of models for him to pose with models and get a bunch of swag
2151.76,2155.02, From from the companies. I
2155.4,2159.04, Did you remember him pitching that worst goals for several each
2160.4,2164.12, Until until somebody finally agreed to do it and it was sort of like
2164.64,2168.44," Hold time like why are we doing this? Yeah, he told me who it was"
2169.64,2173.0," Yeah, well, we'll tell you offline okay. I want to know"
2174.6,2179.4," So yeah, whatever, let's are we gonna mind mind watch out moments in CGW and G"
2179.4,2184.6," Oh man, there's a lot of fun. Most of we can't talk about though. I mean, but there's a lot of them involved our form"
2184.6,2192.8199999999997, We talked about the that's a kick-off. We read that review that never was that preview that was never printed. Oh boy about the ascending mountain
2193.06,2195.06," All right, we got a number of those"
2195.82,2200.2200000000003," There's a little yeah, there's a little folder of like unbelievably"
2200.9,2202.7400000000002, laugh-out loud hilariously bad
2203.7400000000002,2206.38, You told the story of stuff you find when you die. Yeah
2207.3,2213.2200000000003, What the story of Michael Jordan on the cover on the podcast. I think you might know that was at the month
2213.5800000000004,2218.34, I'm hoping we have it because I didn't get I believe it was the Ken Levine special
2218.34,2221.86," Oh, yes, yes, when it was supposed to be Baldur's Gate"
2221.86,2227.3," Yeah, yeah, people's Gate too. Yeah, it's good tail. I remember running into to rain Greg"
2227.3,2229.78," I don't know if I told this part of the story, but rain rain Greg"
2230.7400000000002,2232.02, At Bioware
2232.02,2238.5, You know at that time you have to remember Bioware was still even though Baldur's Gate one was a huge hit
2238.5,2241.3, They were not the Bioware that they are today
2241.3,2245.1400000000003, They were not triple A they had one great RPG under their belt
2245.62,2252.06, But but at that point that was it really so you know the decision to put Baldur's Gate two on the cover
2252.06,2255.94, Wasn't quite as cut and tried as it would with say anything they made right now
2256.18,2264.1," At the time you know, they were still a little bit of a chosen endie, but but to the only people buying the magazine back then as much as today though"
2264.2599999999998,2270.22," Were people well that's true. Yes, we're PC game. It wasn't like some dude who's like just wanders drunk"
2270.22,2274.94, You have drunk out of the sports bar and he's like holy shit computer gave you a
2275.14,2276.18, Michael Jordan on it
2276.18,2281.7799999999997," Well, certainly a ball does get to cover. Yes, would have been more successful than a Michael Jordan cover"
2282.42,2290.22, And it wasn't even like a Michael Jordan game it was like some random like image of Michael Jordan that they got some are in Photoshop
2290.22,2295.9," Then Corbys or something yeah, and then the only content there wasn't even there was like a 15 word"
2296.2999999999997,2299.1," Yeah, micro preview of an edc"
2299.1,2303.7799999999997," No, I'm a Viva game. Yeah, right that was where very somewhere in the book"
2303.78,2308.7400000000002," Right, but I remember running into rain and Greg and a bar and they were so"
2309.5,2315.5800000000004," bitter, you know, I mean at at that very moment because I told them that they couldn't over the following or whatever"
2315.5800000000004,2319.94," Email that they couldn't they weren't not sell was an energy, but whoever was energy said"
2319.94,2323.2200000000003," You know, you're not getting at the full cover. We it because of this we got you know"
2323.2200000000003,2328.9," If Davis is concerned about what's gonna sell, you know, we have to appeal to the widest possible audience and then you know"
2328.9,2331.6200000000003, I ran into them at a bar and they were like
2332.14,2334.14, We didn't get the full cover because of that
2334.74,2336.74, The fucking Michael Jordan
2338.74,2340.74," Yeah, it was great did they ever forgive you"
2341.22,2347.24," Sure they throw my beard on your face. Yeah, she put Michael Jordan on the dragon age cover just for good measure. Oh"
2347.24,2352.3399999999997," That would have been great. Oh God, and now we don't have a magazine to do that anymore"
2352.74,2354.98, What a great joke that was so awesome
2355.5,2362.82, So that story that bothers G-2 stories actually my I flew up to Edmonton's it's a picture of
2362.82,2365.46, Jordan popping up in the corner. What's going on?
2367.46,2369.06, It would have been the greatest in
2369.98,2375.86, What a got rain Greg and all over again like most inside joke and human history on GFW
2376.34,2377.78, Think of like you get ahead
2378.78,2381.3, Because like you know a peggle was a guy's pop up
2381.3,2385.6600000000003," After you get like a big combo sure. Yeah, like that. Yeah, Michael Jordan pop up"
2385.6600000000003,2391.2000000000003," Yes, maybe they could build that into dragon age like when you left a lot you're Michael Jordan popping up"
2391.7400000000002,2393.7400000000002," Good job, yo"
2393.7400000000002,2395.7400000000002, You got five points to spend now
2398.02,2400.02, So so
2400.02,2405.28, That story that I for that issue about FK2 that was that was probably my low as a
2405.8,2409.36, As a game journalist like not you know not being
2409.96,2412.84, Responsible and just doing the dumb thing as as a little bit younger
2413.0,2417.1600000000003, They flew me up to Edmonton to see you ball ticket to it never been Canada before
2418.0,2422.46," The buyer where guys, you know, I wanted to take me out drinking that first night"
2423.1000000000004,2425.1000000000004, I don't know if you've had Canadian beer
2425.7200000000003,2431.48, Much higher alcohol content than our weekend American beer. I did not have any dinner
2432.36,2438.28, So I sat with these guys. I had six points of beer and I'm a lightweight already
2438.28,2443.36, I'm done after two normally I had six points of this stuff. I was so
2444.4,2450.2, So fucking drunk that I mean they were basically like carrying me back to my hotel room in Edmonton
2450.2,2454.68, I did not know where I was really I mean I'm not I'm not saying it was like I'm bragging
2454.68,2458.4, I'm not I'm not a drinker. This was not something I'm saying with any pride
2458.4,2462.08, I'm just telling it because when I look back on it it was so ridiculous
2462.96,2469.7200000000003, So they brought me to my hotel room the last thing I remember that night was I just was like I was like looking at the bed
2469.7200000000003,2471.98, And then I just like face planted on it like
2475.98,2479.6800000000003, And then then then I blacked out and then the next thing I knew
2480.64,2482.64, was that I
2482.64,2487.88, I was I knew I was horizontal and I knew that my face was really cold
2488.4,2494.2400000000002, And it felt like it was that it was I was laying on something hard and I open my eyes and I saw wood paneling
2494.2400000000002,2497.88, And then I lifted my head up and I was laying down
2497.88,2502.52, I passed up in the bathroom because I guess I had wandered in there like to throw up or something
2502.52,2506.48, And so what I was seeing was like the you know the cabinet of the sink
2506.88,2512.1600000000003, So that was it sometime in the middle of the night then the next thing I did was morning and there wake me up to go do this cover story
2512.1600000000003,2515.04, And this is the first time I had met these guys
2515.6,2521.52, And this is early on and my in my game journals career too. So you know imagine you know you get to do a cover story
2521.52,2527.24, It's a sequel to this RPG or flaunt you I flew to another country to go do it. You're the first I was first
2527.24,2530.48, I saw sit we got the first thing I wish you access and
2531.48,2534.72, Was you know I'm the first person see ball just get to me
2535.52,2538.52, So I so then so that next morning
2538.88,2543.08, Completely just an horrible bad shape. You know just really terrible shape
2543.08,2549.44, I had to go to buy a wire to meet with these guys. I'm sitting down with Greg the president of the company and Ray and they're talking to me about
2550.04,2553.16, bothersome it to this is pre like I didn't have a video
2553.16,2554.68, I mean a voice recorder
2554.68,2558.04, You know I just I can my note pad and the entire time
2558.68,2563.32, That they're talking to me about their brand new game all that is going through my head is
2563.32,2565.32, Please don't throw up please don't throw up
2566.28,2569.0800000000004, That you're gonna be like could Michael Jordan hit a three point
2570.1200000000003,2573.32," No, I couldn't even hear about what they were talking about it was like, oh man"
2573.32,2577.84, I just I'm not letting I'm gonna have to get like press releases on this game because I can't hear a word
2577.84,2584.2000000000003," He's saying and I'm going back and read that coverage. Yeah, you should go back and read it because how could you even play that game?"
2584.2000000000003,2587.6400000000003, I would have such horrible associations with balkers gate two for the rest of that
2588.44,2593.0, Based on these stories you're telling me I couldn't load it up without just like shuddering
2593.16,2595.16, Allers gates and portal to enhance filth
2596.76,2602.2, So what about Ryan and Sean you got what's your your lowest moment your career?
2603.24,2604.52, God
2604.52,2611.32," Low it's no man. No, I don't know if your career's been long enough to have it low moment Ryan you just tend to avoid watch out scenarios pretty well"
2612.44,2614.44, I do what I can yeah
2614.44,2620.52, Why you did actually kind of bullshit free but you did cop to like hanging action figures in their package on your wall
2620.52,2622.52, That's how does that happen to do with my career
2624.36,2626.36, That's just normal
2626.84,2628.84, She's every day stuff
2628.84,2633.24, I don't know I'm drawing a blank here. I could have had prep time if you can remember I told my mind
2633.24,2635.64, I told mine on on one of yours
2636.04,2638.44, I don't know if it's the lowest but when I went to see the
2639.4,2640.68, 50 cent game
2640.68,2643.96, I didn't do anything that was done becoming or that I regret but we basically
2644.68,2645.88, I was told no
2645.88,2651.08, James got this exclusive on the 50 cents making a game you get to go down and you get to interview 50 cent
2652.04,2656.6800000000003, Long story short. I go down there and I'm in this room and it's nothing but a PR guy to talk to
2657.0,2662.6, The room's covered in 50 cent memorabilia and he turns on a an after playing music and taking me a lunch and give him
2662.6,2664.6800000000003, Me some vitamin water like 50 cent brand
2665.2400000000002,2669.48, He turns on a video and it's an interview a pre-recorded interview with internal
2670.28,2671.48, PR
2671.48,2676.2, and 50 cent and it's the point that it was unedited so you could hear them coaching him and telling them
2676.2,2679.64, We started it and begin his sentences and his responses this way and then when we're done
2679.64,2681.32, I was like so what where's my interview?
2681.32,2686.28, They're like oh well we're transcribing that video you saw and then once that passes for approval
2686.6,2693.4, Then they then had to approve the transcript of their internal video interview so your interview was just
2693.72,2696.92, Give that to me was just pre done one with his own PR
2697.56,2699.56," Yeah, it was your interview and that's what they"
2700.44,2703.08, So I think just that whole scenario was one of those like
2704.12,2706.44, Wow what the hell good
2706.44,2707.64, Lo-
2707.64,2713.48," That was for your cover short. No, it wasn't a cover story. I got to go back and read it. I know I got plenty. I mean do there's I I"
2714.04,2715.08, Basically
2715.56,2717.2400000000002, Everything I said here. I made clear the
2718.44,2720.44, Sunder which I I saw the game
2721.96,2726.84, I can't think of other good moments. I had a I had a good wash on mom and actually it was before I worked
2727.6400000000003,2733.6400000000003, at CGW in the old days. I was on Mac Week another defunct zif davis publication. Thank you very much
2734.36,2739.08, It was a weekly Mac and touch business magazine and it was very much more like
2740.04,2744.6800000000003," a news magazine, you know, it was not catered to end users like just mac users"
2744.6800000000003,2746.6800000000003, It's it's container to like business
2747.4,2752.6800000000003, Everyone's in a while. I would I would lobby to do a gaming story because I didn't really give a fuck about the
2752.7599999999998,2754.7599999999998, Motum beat that that I was on
2755.48,2760.44, So I would say like you know a lot of game companies who are like using macs to make games or something
2760.44,2765.7999999999997, Why are we doing article on that so so I did get through one to do an article on a
2766.3599999999997,2770.44, Lucas arts who who were big Mac proponents at that time. This is like the
2772.12,2774.12, early 90s and
2774.9199999999996,2780.12, So me and a couple of the guys from Mac Week went to to Lucas arts ranch and so this is the first time again
2780.12,2784.92, You took it with the ranch and you know if you're a dark that's kind of like a big cool deal
2787.16,2794.3599999999997, But back in those days at Mac Week because it was more like a news organization the policy was when you went to go do an offsite
2794.8399999999997,2796.8399999999997, interview you had to wear suit
2796.8399999999997,2800.7599999999998," So we all were are you know, I wore like a black suit with a white"
2801.24,2808.52, White shirt and tie the other two guys and we got to the Lucas arts ranch and all these dudes are like in like fucking like cutoff shorts and like you know
2808.7599999999998,2811.96, Thongs I mean like sand so I don't mean like
2813.96,2817.0, Maybe they were but I didn't see them but
2817.72,2824.84, But so we we get to the ranch and we're gonna we're gonna meet with all these people and right before we're gonna sit down to meet with the Lucas arts people
2825.4,2827.64, You guys have seen this I have some kind of like
2828.68,2831.08, Horrible like fucked up problem with pens
2831.4,2836.7599999999998," Where they like yes, you know like cuz like chew on them chew on them and then they will explode in your face"
2836.84,2842.6000000000004," So that's what happened. What's great. Yeah, so what happened was I had been doing that with this black pen"
2843.2400000000002,2850.92, Which I would say would I put in the shirt pocket of my white shirt and then is saying it didn't just it didn't just like leak this thing
2850.92,2854.1200000000003, It was like if fucking like internally combustible
2854.36,2861.2400000000002, So that was just like this black my whole white shirt was black like it had been like I'd been shot in the heart and like blood black
2861.48,2864.36, This is and this is weird. It's not surprising to me at all
2865.0,2869.7200000000003, So at my whole day at the Lucas arts ranch. I'm this dark everyone just totally casually dress
2869.7200000000003,2875.56, I'm I'm in this suit with black ink all over me didn't you did you do it? Why didn't you just button up your jacket?
2876.28,2880.92, Oh well that was the other thing it was like in 90 degrees outside. It was too hot nice
2882.28,2885.7200000000003, Well right I don't know much to go with that's it. That's not much of a story
2885.7200000000003,2889.6400000000003, But when they're like yeah when we interviewed will write and Lucy brecha the uh
2890.2000000000003,2891.4, There's like a
2891.4,2893.4, video version of it on
2893.4,2895.4, If you're wondering what Jeff is in the background
2896.2000000000003,2902.36, Because I'm neatly prior to sitting down with the two at max studios Jeff was eating a pen yet again
2903.48,2906.12, And if your slater is fucking face so he's like
2906.76,2915.56," I'll sit over here while you hit her view of Sean yeah, I guess it I guess it it exploded and the ink was on my fingers and then I was like putting my hands on my face"
2916.52,2922.36," And yeah, we shot and I sit down with Lucy Bradshaw and we'll write and the two of them were they weren't even saying anything"
2922.36,2926.92, They were being so polite. They're just looking me in a shot. I was like dude. You got fucking ink all of you
2929.16,2931.16, So we moved me off camera
2933.32,2937.64," And again, I'm surprised you can pick up pens and do that after your traumatic and Lucas arts experience"
2937.64,2941.08, I just don't think about it. You don't learn problem if you don't do not learn
2941.4,2946.68, Expand our range to include things that we've seen other people in the industry involved in in doing
2947.16,2949.16, Like we would be a sorting have like another
2950.2799999999997,2956.2," hours I mean just the idea just legendary scenarios that yeah, I remember being at a yeah"
2956.44,2962.2799999999997, And evented a EA years ago with Robert coffee and there's a freelancer who was just notorious for
2963.0,2965.0, Doing cocaine
2965.0,2967.0, Yeah
2968.2,2972.52, So so Robert coffee and I read this if it was like one of those EA day things and
2972.92,2976.04, You know Robert coffee who I love is a good friend of mine
2976.6,2980.76," He could kick my ass because he knows Krav Maga, but he's kind of short"
2981.4,2987.88, So you know he went to the mentor him at this EA event and he's standing next to the guy
2988.2,2991.4, This guy who's notorious you're doing cocaine and because of Robert coffee
2991.88,2996.28, You know is the height he was he actually had a you know clear view up this guys nostrils
2998.28,3003.32, And sure enough they were you know coded white and so he came out of the bathroom and he was like
3003.32,3005.32, Hey go check out I almost said a name
3007.0,3008.84, Go check out what this name's nose
3008.84,3013.48, So so I made it I did I went walked over there and made a pretense because we're about the same height
3013.48,3018.6," I've been able to you know look a couple inches under and yeah, and then if you watch if you want to"
3018.6,3025.64, Throughout the day as you like talking to the to the you know to the developer it's the whole things like so
3027.0,3029.0, How many levels you think the skate has I
3030.04,3031.24, Wow
3031.24,3036.2799999999997," It was a feeling holy he was just sniffing and that was it. Oh, yeah far as I know"
3039.16,3045.24," Finally, watch our moments are like stupid bad PR stories, which I think we've already told"
3045.96,3047.96, Tell one Ryan
3049.56,3058.92," The one where you're you're physically threatened. Oh, there's that one. Oh my god. That was fantastic. That was awesome. That was epic. Yeah, tell that story"
3059.96,3065.88," That was well I won't say the name should be left out. Yeah, well. Thanks a name is out. I won't say the username but God this dude"
3067.4,3070.64," Is crazy man, but I had written a blog"
3070.64,3073.96," Can I say what the blog was about? No, don't say the game"
3073.96,3080.6, Then they'll be easy to figure out everything I had written a blog a very critical blog
3081.88,3086.2, Everyone's going through Ryan's own blog calling calling a particular company out for
3087.08,3091.88, Just calling them out that's all you got to say yes for for something coaching Ryan and
3093.8,3095.8, How not to end up in a loss
3096.2,3099.48, And this this dude this PR dude for it could have been a woman
3100.76,3102.76, PR dude or woman okay
3103.5600000000004,3105.5600000000004," Yeah, cause it calls"
3105.8,3107.0800000000004, Darren's
3107.0800000000004,3116.6000000000004," Yes, boy smell not not me not not you right not me or you and just leaves this terrible scream about how"
3118.36,3123.5600000000004, You know you can't believe I post it all this and he's gonna like kick my ass of you season
3123.5600000000004,3128.2000000000003, Me a GEC the next week and like you want to ring my neck and all this stuff
3128.6,3133.24," Is this this really vicious vicious voice me. I was you know, I was in two and I thought it was hilarious"
3134.12,3136.12, But it was it was so bad
3136.68,3142.9199999999996, That it got forwarded on to our age our department right by our editorial director at the time and
3143.96,3149.0, The dude was forced to apologize right and he was falling all over himself to apologize after that
3149.72,3153.7999999999997, Right because it did actually turned into a you have threatened physical violence
3153.8,3155.8, That's one of our editors and we can sue you
3156.2000000000003,3160.04, It is that when that's when you start bringing that big thing a pepper spray on your backpack
3162.44,3164.44, Case that that was awesome
3165.7200000000003,3169.7200000000003, I need it right in more blog posts like that can't remember what you said now that's so angered him
3171.0800000000004,3173.0800000000004, I remember what I said
3173.0800000000004,3174.1200000000003, I
3174.1200000000003,3176.1200000000003, Still feel I was justified in that
3176.84,3178.84, Of course you were
3178.92,3183.96, Luckily there are lots and lots of angry blog posts directly different developers
3183.96,3190.2000000000003," Oh, I mean yeah, I made lots of angry blog posts on my blog so good luck narrowing that all anger"
3193.0,3194.52," Right, I got nothing"
3194.52,3196.52, You know I've done
3196.52,3199.0," Stupid shit, but I'm trying to giant blank"
3200.04,3202.04, Why don't even know how we got off on this tangent
3203.1600000000003,3206.84, You're talking about so two confessions talking about a couple of other typical week
3207.4,3209.4, And do you have to be ready?
3209.4,3212.92," Tangent tangent tangent yeah, that's the thing what what are we gonna name?"
3213.48,3217.6400000000003, What's the name of this podcast gonna be let's put it out there to the listeners?
3217.88,3219.4, What would you like us to be called?
3219.4,3221.4, So we just be the brody
3221.4,3222.76," Yeah, I'd be 7.5 the brody"
3222.76,3225.2400000000002," Oh, this can be difficult. We don't want to I think"
3226.2000000000003,3234.6800000000003," a name that's that's more general. You know, we could probably bring in listeners that otherwise wouldn't try us because it sounds so specific like oh well"
3234.7599999999998,3236.7599999999998, I'm not a PC gamer
3236.7599999999998,3239.56, I always said GFW radio had a nice ring to it
3239.96,3242.7599999999998, After right not a first you didn't it's like we I'm just kidding
3243.3199999999997,3245.72, I don't know and then but then later it builds
3246.44,3253.64," Listen to it know what it is now is like making it clear that okay, yes that the artist formerly known as will not the artist but the dipshits formerly"
3253.64,3255.64," No, yes GFW right"
3255.96,3257.7999999999997, They're actually gonna lose people and confuse them
3258.68,3263.0, True moves and confused maybe we just say stay as GFW because that's what I'm talking about
3263.08,3265.08, George cast
3266.04,3270.2, People the brody was popular some people already started hating that
3270.84,3276.52, I don't really like the brody I got it I got it come up you confess I don't like the brody really really you haven't really sat with me
3277.64,3279.0, Really yeah
3279.0,3282.92, What did you have what did you send me the other day of something else with the bro prefix?
3283.88,3285.88, Oh bro he me in a rhapsody
3288.28,3290.28, Bro he me in radio
3290.36,3296.92, But Ryan linked to me just yesterday I think some t-shirt was like a cafe pressure there was some site
3296.92,3302.84," That's a brody though that has all these t-shirts that say brody I want them. Yeah, it's not related dust though, which pissed me off"
3303.88,3308.0400000000004," But he stole it from something else. Brody I was San Francisco too, which is in a weirder"
3308.6800000000003,3312.36, I let we need a cafe press shirt for Robert Barbito
3312.6800000000003,3314.28," Okay, Max chill because he"
3314.84,3316.84, In the thread about this
3317.4,3320.36, You know closure of the magazine he just posted
3321.1600000000003,3326.04, It's time for law school and then the response was Max chill ace attorney
3327.88,3334.52, I want to sure to that I saw Dr. Maximum chill PhD in Berkeley the other night. I think I told you that that's a chilling
3335.1600000000003,3339.88," He was chillin. Yeah, my my wife and I were eating at this awesome"
3340.04,3345.6400000000003, New Orleans restaurant in downtown Berkeley and it's always really crowded on the weekends
3345.72,3352.3599999999997," Possibly get in and there's just a line and so he and a bunch of sort of a nightly looking folks. No, they were nice looking people"
3353.24,3355.24, This probably is wifey shouldn't say
3357.16,3361.0, Walked up and they were like stay stood in line for like two minutes and then like
3361.3199999999997,3366.92, Because it was like which was a really good call because the people in front of right in front of them in the line
3367.4,3373.4, My wife and I ate our whole meal had dessert sat around hogging the table not getting up as soon as we should have if we were people
3373.96,3379.56, Before like anybody in that line had even moved well Max chill will not have eaten dinner till like 11 o'clock
3381.08,3383.08, And that's this if that's the weekend news
3385.88,3392.36," I got nothing this week. Yeah, so what else is the opportunity? You used the opportunity while we have it anything else"
3393.0,3395.0, about the magazine that you want to say
3396.2000000000003,3398.2000000000003, Story you want to tell
3398.6,3400.6, What was the
3400.6,3406.92, We were you brought a stop which were you most embarrassed stuff? What are your top five favorite GFW stories?
3407.3199999999997,3409.3199999999997, I got plenty of one
3409.3199999999997,3413.16, GFW but over my career that I was embarrassed of and they're probably online so
3413.96,3415.96, Probably plenty on one up. Oh
3415.96,3419.7999999999997, We can't talk about the can't wait to cover the gave star cover that never happened
3420.68,3425.08, I don't know the halo one the why people don't finish game someone why can't tell
3425.48,3428.92, This is like ancient history. That was pretty that was pretty sad. I remember what okay
3429.0,3433.4, So the cover story the whole thing there was you know part of the experimentation was like
3433.8,3440.44, You know we can't we don't have like the subscription you know based to to convince these publishers to give us the world exclusives on their big name titles
3440.44,3441.8, So we're gonna you know
3442.04,3445.32, Use these theme covers and have naked women
3446.12,3451.88, It's a sell and one month it was and it was a pretty cool idea. It's funny because this was years ago
3451.88,3458.12, And I just saw it seems like you know one up just put a story on the same topic up as why people don't finish the games and
3459.32,3465.8," But the cover image I don't know where it originated, but they're like okay, we got we're gonna get this illustrator"
3466.36,3470.28, And it was just it was a guy associated with uidom studios
3470.6,3475.08, But it was like an intern or something must have been an attire. It wasn't like one of the main
3475.32,3482.92, You know one of the the principal artists of this outfit and the idea was like a master chief helmet with like a spider of the cobweb
3482.92,3486.12, And it like maybe a skeleton right? It's what's been like shattered
3486.12,3491.16, Like a sick album in there and the rotting or can we have all you middle movie deathcon whatever it was
3491.72,3495.3399999999997," Like some kind of like thing on that, but you look at it and it just look boss"
3495.3399999999997,3500.3199999999997, A look Jake is hell. I remember we were walking we all walked in the office to look at it on the mind and nearly all just like
3501.12,3505.92," No, it's like waiting for you to like okay Microsoft's gonna go crazy"
3505.92,3507.92, We were trying to see with this
3507.92,3512.2999999999997," Hello third like that that wasn't really me, but it's like just a thing looks so dumb"
3513.02,3519.1800000000003," It looks shady. Yeah, well, we had used the outlet before for a cover that turned out really well"
3519.1800000000003,3523.0600000000004," So we're just like okay, let's use it again and then like you said must have been the internist"
3524.42,3528.1400000000003, Sometimes those happily it's cover image is man like that's always an interesting thing
3528.1400000000003,3531.86, I don't like when EGM did the Saints row two cover like I mean
3531.86,3537.32, Whatever cool story Robert did next on the job at the image is like here's tough guy and tough chick
3537.94,3539.94, There they are
3539.94,3543.04, Really are just a nightmare. They really are I mean
3543.78,3546.18, You have even a lot in a lot of ways you have two
3546.9,3549.3, interests that need to be a piece exactly
3549.3,3554.06, Interest of us which is to sell the thing and then the interest of the developer and publisher
3554.06,3559.52, Which is to sell it their game the way they're planning on selling right and then we also in our case
3559.52,3562.94, We had you know these if Davis overlords with their own agenda
3563.06,3567.06, So you had us as editors knowing what would please our readers
3567.2999999999997,3575.66, We had the game company wanting to basically you know use the cover as a marketing tool and then we had our publishers who wanted to
3576.94,3582.64, Ensure that it would sell as much as it could on the newsstand even though they didn't know anything about games
3582.64,3587.12, So they didn't really know what would sell this is like reading tea leaves to me. Everyone had so well
3587.12,3593.92," Yes, I think like well it should be covered in text or it should be you know and you have to have you have to mention all these things and that's a proven"
3593.92,3600.54," Yeah, I have been in circ meeting every year of my life for like the last seven years and every year"
3600.54,3605.7200000000003, There's like a new color right yellow cells everything's got me yellow next year. It's like oh yellow's terrible
3605.7200000000003,3610.6800000000003, Use white green and then it's different every time right in fact shot and I we were in this last
3610.88,3617.16, Cirque meeting the the ill-fated I guess last circ meeting ever for GFW and that came up remember
3617.16,3621.2400000000002, It came up that white covers cell and we all out loud
3621.24,3626.8799999999997, I mean that was I was like this like monumentally awesome lack of respect for the circuit for like one minute
3626.8799999999997,3631.3799999999997," Well all the others and like you know the other editor from other public Kate like I mean, you know"
3631.3799999999997,3635.7799999999997," Our boss too was there like going just sort of laughing at that point like oh, so it's white now"
3635.7799999999997,3638.12," Yeah, okay, so it's not purple this year"
3638.12,3643.3999999999996," Taking this and the guy was just kind of sitting there like well, let's with the data point is I've always been an invasive"
3644.04,3645.8599999999997, Edge magazine you know published in
3645.86,3652.38," United Kingdom because the way that their model works to have so few subscribers, but the description costs so much"
3652.38,3658.2200000000003," And it's about hitting I mean, and that's like that's a perfect scenario. It's like you know exactly who you're you're"
3658.78,3663.1400000000003, Writing for and who you're creating this for you. You don't have to make your money back by selling a
3663.5,3668.5, Bajili and so they do you two come to have drunk out of the sports bar and so their covers can be like
3668.5,3671.78, That the incredible when they did on rock band it was like a
3671.78,3677.26," Apple fire, but it's a bit of a back and then that was the games, you know each of the stickers would be like"
3677.26,3679.9," Okay, this means there's some coverage of this game in here as well"
3679.9,3682.6600000000003," It was such a perfect day, but it's beautiful magazine"
3682.6600000000003,3688.6000000000004, Nothing if we there was like no chance and how that anyone that doesn't operate on that model could get away with doing that
3688.6000000000004,3695.44," You know, it's weird what you're saying like totally gave me Brad Bartel flashbacks because he was talking in terms of you know"
3695.44,3700.1400000000003," Selling games to the people he knows who are gonna buy it. Yeah, it's like a wow. Whoa, we're"
3700.44,3706.94," Yeah, right, so yeah, like we would definitely make I mean that's another it's an awesome position to be in"
3706.94,3711.46, It's trying to like again like it goes back it goes back to everything like our stories
3711.46,3717.7799999999997, You know and and the you know the kind of with the pressures too strong online to just replicate the last week's success
3717.7799999999997,3723.8199999999997, You know and you get you get magazines that made that way you get games that are made that way and it's like
3724.3799999999997,3728.58, That's all I do know what you want to do and do it and then if you do it well enough
3728.58,3732.98," Yeah, people will like it and you know, word will spread we never had that"
3732.98,3738.5, We were never given that kind of independence with our covers and it was always always the social frustration
3738.5,3743.2999999999997, I mean even if the other people who were involved had good intentions which they did and were good people
3743.2999999999997,3750.88, Which they pretty much are still there's something about like designing a cover by committee with all these people with these different agendas
3750.88,3756.66, That's just so fucking soul sucking right now that we could we weren't in charge of it
3756.66,3758.66, That we couldn't just say as a scoop of
3758.96,3763.14, You know ostensibly creative people that the sevenest make it into this magazine could just go
3763.14,3766.3399999999997, Let's make a really kick ass cover and then come up with an idea
3766.3399999999997,3769.7599999999998," Which is the impression you get when you read edge. Oh, yeah"
3769.7599999999998,3776.48, Get edge every month that will come in and you go fuck what a good cover right whereas we got like all these bullshit different masters
3776.48,3779.96, Right answering to you got to get a number on the cover every month
3779.96,3785.56, You got to get you know 55 ways to you know that's against six pack abs
3785.7,3789.88, Or whatever it is not in our case. This is the number of games that are right in
3789.88,3795.72, 57 previews. Oh and make sure it's an odd number because people will believe it's more real if it's an odd number
3795.72,3798.68, If you say it's 50 games that think you made it up
3798.68,3804.24, So what you want to do is you want to say 49 because then they'll think you got four really got 49
3806.44,3812.08, Sadly you're quoting someone that's a good one. This is what my fucking days were like this is what this is that's the part of the job
3812.08,3814.72, I am not going to miss making those covers
3815.68,3816.68, Soct
3816.68,3817.68, And you know
3817.68,3824.4," We always wonder where we have this like pragmatic what we did we're like well, this is on the cover now, but you're like that's like a"
3825.0,3830.36, Like a 30 word like micro item in the context of some other story. Should we really be?
3830.36,3833.16," Oh, yeah going for that bait and switching then it's like oh, yeah"
3833.16,3836.7999999999997, Who the fuck is this guy talking and it's like you kind of just hang your head and walk out you know
3836.96,3837.96, Yep
3837.96,3838.7599999999998, Yep
3838.7599999999998,3845.04," Well, we got that like every month whatever you got in there get well to walk craft on the cover"
3845.04,3848.4, Doesn't matter and it's the all the stuff I had
3848.84,3855.24, He's working in the circuit apartment itself. They're all guys. I'm just suddenly it's a 50 year old
3855.88,3859.7, Jewish lady whatever you do you got to get what it walked craft on the cover
3859.9,3867.12, Just put a 15 word right up in the a new section about some new map and that's enough to get it on the cover
3867.12,3868.48, Because what it will craft cells?
3869.12,3870.96, That's what we learned this week
3871.08,3876.0, What do walkf cells so I mean you could actually look in a bunch of past issues and you can see
3876.32,3880.88, There's always a cover line about world of walkraft. Do you find great comfort in phones?
3881.44,3883.88, Because I don't know you can't see this but Jeff here has
3884.44,3886.44, The head of your ass
3887.16,3894.08," All right, oh god, that's so buffoonish. I find a link. Wow. He's like let's okay. Yeah, freeze. Okay. All right"
3894.56,3895.92, There's we need a different
3895.92,3897.92, Traditional wall phone
3897.92,3902.84," Find him. He's pulled the receiver from that off. Okay, and he's got that in his hand"
3902.84,3903.84, Just on the block
3903.84,3908.6800000000003, And then his other hand he has a cell phone open but upside down
3909.16,3911.16, Is that he's kind of
3911.16,3913.16, Why do I think
3915.16,3920.28, You don't even know you're sick. You know we're in Edmonton Canada. Do you even know where you're at right now? I do
3920.28,3922.6800000000003, I just you know when I start babbling I just
3923.64,3926.48, Fitch it I need things to need a hand
3926.48,3931.3199999999997," I'm doing it. I'm doing it with this card give him a pen the eat. Oh, yes, you're right"
3931.3199999999997,3933.3199999999997," Wow, it's a strange"
3933.3199999999997,3939.48," Let's post that on dual wielding phones right now. Yeah, so I'll talk about we're talking about covers and then the other part"
3939.48,3945.72, I mean you get the game companies at times cannot be let off the hook. I mean you know because
3946.52,3948.52, They
3948.52,3953.7599999999998, You know obviously there they they want their game to look in the best possible light they do
3953.7599999999998,3955.7599999999998, And that's understandable
3956.1,3960.6, But what was often hard for so many game companies to understand was that
3961.0,3966.7999999999997," We were not their game box, you know, and this article was not part of their PR plan"
3966.7999999999997,3973.64, And so we might have a specific idea of what we might want to do editorially for the cover or we might understand
3974.6,3979.8399999999997, What sells on the new stands though apparently I guess we don't since we're at a business
3980.4,3983.4, But but
3984.12,3986.12, But they would have some specific
3986.8399999999997,3993.44, Agenda that was based on their their own internal marketing that would have nothing to do with anything
3994.0,4001.2, Related to our magazine or what should be on a cover. They will determine in advance when they begin their their you know
4001.2,4002.7, Their PR programs like which
4003.24,4007.3399999999997, They'll have art and we'll set it aside and say this is going to be this magazine's cover
4007.3399999999997,4012.3999999999996," Yes, it'll be this magazine's covered. They'll plan it out for the entire year and just yes, say this is"
4012.3999999999996,4018.68, And then sometimes they'll just say and we don't have any other art for you right so we would essentially be you know
4019.2,4024.04, You know between a rock and a hard place there because we're we're dependent on them for the art
4024.2,4028.68, But they're not giving any to us because they've given us the one they're gonna give us yeah
4028.68,4035.8799999999997," MJ would fight the good fight and say no, this is just not gonna work and we've made it to get some some otherwise"
4036.44,4038.44, Final art that they're just it nothing else
4039.3199999999997,4042.56, And sometimes they're great to work with the of course there
4042.56,4046.96, They'll say oh you need an adjustment here. You need the composition change and they'll totally do it
4046.96,4052.5, I would say that like the same three cover. I mean the Sims has notoriously been
4053.64,4058.6, Incredibly difficult franchise for us to get a good cover for and it's not
4058.9199999999996,4063.08, Their fault it's not EA's fault. It's just it's really the fact that this franchise
4063.24,4067.68, You know it doesn't have a traditional like image that can be represented on a cover
4067.68,4071.12, There's no iconic figure you know there's no obvious Mario or anything
4071.12,4074.04, But it also does I mean regardless of an iconic figure
4074.04,4077.48," There's also like not like guys with guns, you know"
4077.48,4080.3599999999997, There's no Martians there's not that's a typical kind of things
4081.24,4083.24," You would put on a yeah, but that's"
4083.24,4087.3199999999997," So yeah, there's a time where like it seemed like five months in a row"
4087.3199999999997,4092.6," It was like it was a guy in armor holding seems like it was on yeah, and not just start magazine"
4092.6,4095.2, But everyone you know like it's just there it is
4095.2,4097.719999999999, There's a guy with a different kind of which game is that guy?
4097.719999999999,4101.08," No, yeah, remember when we line those up in a row it was like early on in"
4101.08,4102.92, FW when we switched to GFW
4102.92,4108.4," Guy with gun there were like three or four more. Yeah, yeah guy with got in the same pose like angled the same way"
4108.4,4112.719999999999," Different colors background right this one's the red version. Yeah, that was great"
4114.08,4116.08, How's it a proud of that
4117.32,4120.2," Sims cover yeah, I'm one creative dude here"
4123.08,4129.88, It's funny that you call those and the Sims games like some of the most difficult ones because like our Sims three cover and our
4130.5199999999995,4135.88, Sims two cover from CGW or probably two of my favorite covers that we've done. I like those covers too
4135.88,4138.5199999999995, But they were it was so hard to get to that place
4138.52,4143.76," Well, it's not just like making it look because the discussion is never if something looks good"
4143.76,4148.080000000001," If it's composed well if we understand it, but it's again it did the people in New York understand it"
4148.080000000001,4149.72," Yeah, there's a random you know"
4149.72,4156.3, Jury that they compose of whoever it is who are supposed to be cover experts do they? And or so I don't know what that is that's not mass chief
4156.92,4160.92," That's not you know, I mean, it's it's that's not mass or chief. That's not oh next year"
4161.4400000000005,4163.4400000000005, Right when he's yeah
4163.44,4170.799999999999, Never had an idea ever I do have to say they they did get rid of the in the old days
4170.799999999999,4175.96, Like I'm talking about designing cover by committee which did happen all the way up in tar very last issue here
4176.16,4184.5199999999995, But in the old days it was even worse like the committee was that much bigger because they were these like random people in New York who were just on this email thread
4184.5199999999995,4189.24, I never saw them. I didn't know who they were really who it we'd have to we were like that
4189.24,4192.599999999999," The shadow cats. Yeah, we were forced to like send them the cover"
4194.04,4201.08, To get their approval from this this random group of whatever of Yahoo's and morons and they were just like send back their comments
4201.08,4204.96, What all be this kind of shit you're saying there but just be these random you know
4205.5199999999995,4210.88, I don't know I've never heard of that of that what's what's FPS?
4211.4,4218.04," It's like my son likes Pokemon yeah, why's yeah? Why's there no peek at you?"
4219.24,4223.04," Well, cuz this is a I'm pure PC gaming magazine"
4223.76,4227.219999999999," Yeah, see we cover games on the PC and then you get my code"
4231.219999999999,4233.219999999999, I quit
4234.5199999999995,4238.599999999999, Oh man anyway Jeff's not better and that better
4240.32,4242.32, Let's talk about how we can
4242.679999999999,4244.679999999999, Trade editorial for advertising
4244.68,4250.400000000001, Oh never mind. Let's not trade it. I should I should just say that cuz it has nothing to do with us
4250.400000000001,4256.68, I just like I flipping through magazines today. I saw something to so to someone who understands a business
4256.68,4261.84, It was like playing his day what are the ads next to the article and question not only that
4261.84,4264.68, But where the article only exists because the ad was sold
4265.04,4269.68," Yeah, it's like blatant and that's like we'd never did anything like that so well"
4269.68,4276.240000000001," Hey, where the ones that don't exist anymore, so that's right. Oh, yeah, right don't do what we did"
4277.88,4280.280000000001, You'll end up with just a podcast only
4282.76,4288.64," Podcast only yeah, I could do this five days a week. This would be a good job. Don't you think it's ran here and"
4288.64,4295.06, But I have all these different tree. I would love to have a whole other thing where I mean unfortunately
4295.06,4298.860000000001, You know video editing isn't insanely you know labor intensive and time consuming
4299.14,4303.64," But like if I should probably keep my ideas close to my chest, but I mean yeah"
4303.64,4311.580000000001, I would like to basically do audio and video stuff all the time and but come up with some like really good like a stable of shows and then
4312.18,4314.02, You know kind of in the way that like
4314.38,4316.42, Like the zero punctuation thing has been such a
4316.9400000000005,4324.780000000001, Success but understanding from the beginning. I mean say if you had like a whole bunch of things like that and you knew from the beginning that you were gonna pull the plug on them
4325.06,4330.820000000001, At least temporarily like the day after they sort of hit critical mass so that instead of like now
4330.820000000001,4335.820000000001," Because it happens with everything and we get to play it out and it's like oh, yeah, remember that so you leave it like people like oh shit"
4335.820000000001,4341.780000000001, That was great. This is the same thing that TV does lost or something will stop before you get to the point where you're like fatigued with it
4341.780000000001,4343.780000000001, And then you'll watch it another show
4344.34,4348.660000000001, For the rest of the season and then that will end and you leapfrog between them and have a bunch of like different
4348.660000000001,4351.3," I have all these ideas for cool video things and stuff, but it's like I mean"
4352.26,4359.34, I know I don't know when to paint define it's me so maybe we should make a I have a good idea. Let's make a monthly DVD
4361.9800000000005,4369.820000000001, I'm just getting how does it say when you were talking I just thinking back in the day when all those all these different companies thought that they would make like a CD magazine
4370.1,4375.38, Remember those days remember those I did I remember those we had a CD with Game Star
4376.06,4381.22, But it was no just a see that's different. There was right this is back in the day when like by the CD
4381.22,4387.06, Computer really wasn't even ready to handle that because I would get the had a couple of those and they were just awful
4387.7,4389.860000000001," Yeah, you know your one-speed CD"
4389.860000000001,4392.02, wrong this is the sad thing man like I mean
4392.42,4397.62, Paul jized to every one of the I mean does it I want to Paul just to everyone who subscribed to the magazine in the past
4397.62,4402.46," Yes, yes, yes, thank you, but we're sorry like we are so sorry"
4402.46,4404.46, But I mean obviously

4445.9800000000005,4454.82, I don't know I today part of it's because I work at a job where I stare at a computer that that's another reason why I tend not to do as much reading online
