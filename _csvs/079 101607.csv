301.0,303.0, You don't want to go back to sleep
303.0,305.0," Because you're like, I don't want to go back there"
305.0,307.0," How long does it take me like if I have like, oh no"
307.0,308.0, I can continue
308.0,309.0, But it doesn't exactly
309.0,310.0, It's a good one
310.0,311.0, You wake up
311.0,312.0," You know, Jessica"
312.0,313.0, I was standing right there

322.0,324.0," Sorry, hurry"
324.0,325.0, I've never had that
325.0,326.0, You're swinging your eyes

327.0,328.0, Just come on
328.0,329.0, I'm just kidding
329.0,331.0, I shouldn't be talking about that
331.0,332.0, On my wife's birthday
332.0,333.0, I'm sorry
333.0,335.0, It's a dream about you taking off your top
336.0,337.0, She looks so good
337.0,338.0, She looks so good
338.0,339.0, She looks so good
339.0,340.0, Or soren
340.0,343.0," Oh, hell of"
343.0,344.0, I could have said golem
344.0,345.0, That would have been
347.0,348.0," Alright, let's move on"
348.0,350.0, I just wanted to share that dream
350.0,351.0, No Hobbit Feet
351.0,353.0, Because before we came up here to record
353.0,354.0, Robert and I were talking about how
354.0,356.0, We were gaming like
356.0,358.0, 12 year olds over the weekend
358.0,361.0," It's as far as we're, you know, just nonstop playing these games"
361.0,362.0, Yeah
362.0,363.0, To the point that
363.0,364.0, Yeah
364.0,365.0, On Saturday night
365.0,367.0, It took hours and hours from me to go to bed
367.0,368.0, So it was so keyed up
368.0,369.0, And then actually I dreamt
369.0,371.0, That I was playing like some new
371.0,373.0, Like half-life level
373.0,374.0, Or expansion
374.0,375.0, Some shit
375.0,377.0, And I woke up in the similar state of
377.0,378.0," It's up, you know, no one was there"
378.0,379.0, To call me on it
379.0,381.0," You know, it was like, okay"
381.0,382.0, Yeah
382.0,384.0, I find now that I have to take a break
384.0,385.0, Between
385.0,387.0, Gaming and sleep
387.0,388.0, If I go straight there
388.0,390.0, It would be bad dreams
390.0,391.0, But also just can't sleep
391.0,393.0," Yeah, I got way way way"
393.0,395.0, Way way too keyed up playing on Saturday
395.0,397.0, I was just playing like orange box all day long
397.0,399.0, And like every day shooter
399.0,401.0, And then I went to bed really late
401.0,403.0, And I kept on thinking I was still playing team fortress
403.0,406.0, And then I needed to like lay some more sticky grenades
406.0,407.0, Or something
407.0,409.0, Just having all these like intense
409.0,410.0," Like, well I forgot to play team fortress"
410.0,413.0," And then I wake up and be like, oh, sleep sleep"
413.0,414.0, Yeah
414.0,415.0, Yeah
415.0,416.0, Four of those doing that
416.0,417.0, Seeing portals in your dreams
417.0,418.0," Yeah, totally"
418.0,419.0, Yeah
419.0,420.0, It's like even before you dream too
420.0,421.0, And you go to lay down
421.0,423.0," Because you know, you need like, well, at least I do"
423.0,425.0, You need this kind of like decompression
425.0,427.0, Time and all usually read or something
427.0,429.0, With the light down on one eye open and then
429.0,431.0, I can't just lay in a bed and fall asleep
431.0,433.0, And the last thing I want to do is be playing
433.0,435.0, Video games scenario through in my head
435.0,437.0, But I'll get stuck in that
437.0,439.0," You know, playing what would have had a counter"
439.0,440.0, I just lost it company heroes
440.0,442.0, What would have been a good counter tactic for that
442.0,444.0, How can I find and exploit for one of the classes
444.0,446.0, Team fortress or something
446.0,448.0, And so we ever got set
448.0,450.0, Should have ever gotten up again
450.0,451.0, To go play
451.0,452.0, Yeah
452.0,453.0, Like been in bed
453.0,454.0, Thinking about it
454.0,455.0, And then I'll fuck
455.0,456.0, I'm going to go try again
456.0,457.0," No, thank god, no"
457.0,458.0, I did that once
458.0,459.0, We'll give
459.0,461.0, It was it was a long time ago
461.0,463.0, Actually this was a Jesus
463.0,465.0, I think it was the original company heroes
465.0,467.0, I was trying to tell you
467.0,468.0, You'll have to tell us
468.0,469.0," No, I'm trying to just"
469.0,470.0," All right, all right"
470.0,471.0," No, it was one of those things"
471.0,473.0, We're like I was trying to figure out why I kept losing it
473.0,474.0, This one map
474.0,476.0, And then finally I just kind of dawned on me
476.0,477.0, And I woke up in the middle of the night going
477.0,478.0, That's it
478.0,479.0, This one got up
479.0,481.0, And I got up and just played it in finished the level
481.0,483.0," It's weird, I think I have the exact opposite reaction"
483.0,485.0, Like if I'm playing something that's particularly intense
485.0,487.0, Like I get tired
487.0,489.0, Like it's really strange
489.0,490.0, Like I'll be done
490.0,492.0, I need to go like
492.0,493.0," Wait, I want for a bit"
493.0,494.0, Especially I don't know
494.0,495.0," Yeah, but when you lay down"
495.0,498.0, Then your head isn't still just like spinning with the game
498.0,499.0, No
499.0,500.0," No, no"
500.0,501.0, Really
501.0,502.0," Wow, I wish I had that"
502.0,503.0," Yeah, me too"
503.0,505.0," Man, that game was exhausting"
505.0,507.0, I think I'll go to play those
508.0,509.0, That's kind of sad
509.0,510.0, But it's nice
510.0,511.0, That's nice
511.0,512.0, Well I definitely get to
512.0,514.0, I mean I always know when I'm too
514.0,515.0, When I got to stop because I'm too tired
515.0,519.0," You know, I'll do the same jump in episode two or whatever"
519.0,520.0, And then I just can't make
520.0,522.0, And I'm starting to piss me off and it's like
522.0,523.0," Ah, okay, it's bedtime"
523.0,524.0, I'm getting cranked
524.0,525.0," I mean, it's better"
525.0,528.0, Or do you ever get to that point where you're playing a game
528.0,530.0, And then like you keep like you actually start like nodding off the keyboard
530.0,531.0, Or something
531.0,532.0, Definitely done that
532.0,533.0," Yeah, I've never done that"
533.0,534.0, I've totally done that
534.0,535.0, It's a little bit of an old man
535.0,536.0, Thank you
536.0,537.0," I mean, it especially happened"
537.0,540.0, I noticed it especially if I'm reading in World of Warcraft
540.0,542.0," In that, that in particular for some reason"
542.0,545.0," Like there's just, I don't know, it's most of the mental exhaustion"
545.0,546.0, There's just so much going out
546.0,547.0, I'm so keyed up
547.0,548.0, While I'm doing it
548.0,551.0, And like so worried about like fucking up and having
551.0,553.0, 24 other people go
553.0,554.0," Oh man, you didn't click the cube"
554.0,556.0, You've got a bit of a bitch that like
556.0,557.0, When it's all over I'm like
557.0,558.0, Oh
558.0,561.0, That's totally my first Tony
561.0,562.0, The methadic
562.0,566.0, And that's all the intro you think
566.0,567.0, That's all you think
567.0,568.0, That's all you think
568.0,569.0, That's all you think
569.0,571.0, You can answer yes or no if it's the answers yes
571.0,572.0, I won't retell it
572.0,573.0, Doesn't something really weird
573.0,574.0, So far away we it doesn't sound familiar
574.0,577.0, So the reason of friends with the methadic is like in high school
577.0,580.0, You know your friends as you transition out of high school
580.0,582.0, And in the college and some don't go to college
582.0,584.0, People start doing things
584.0,585.0, And you're still friends with them
585.0,587.0, And those friendships just kind of gradually
587.0,588.0, You fizzle out
588.0,589.0, But not immediately
589.0,590.0, So
590.0,592.0, One of those fake like my friend
592.0,593.0, The methadic
593.0,594.0," No, this is, no this is"
594.0,595.0, This is
595.0,598.0, I mentioned this guy before
598.0,600.0, Because his dad owns some of the biggest
600.0,601.0, The porn shop
601.0,602.0, The porn shop
602.0,604.0, So he ended up becoming a part
604.0,608.0, Non-Meliet
608.0,610.0, But he would call us over in the middle of the night
610.0,611.0, Just beg and you know you get
611.0,613.0, A call like two in the morning or something
613.0,614.0, You know be like summer
614.0,616.0, You know this is aniosn Negra
616.0,617.0, Or something
617.0,618.0, Come on man you got a come over
618.0,619.0," Well actually, it wasn't one of us on Negra"
619.0,620.0, It was fast that
620.0,621.0, And he'd biggest come over
621.0,622.0, Mean the center got quarry
622.0,623.0, To play halo
623.0,624.0, And
624.0,627.04," And once in a while you just like, okay,"
627.04,629.56," we'll indulge you, we'll come over and play some fucking halo with you."
629.56,631.2, And he's just freaking out.
631.2,634.8," The whole time he keeps thinking he hears something,"
634.8,636.56, like someone's looking through the window or something
636.56,637.56, will freak us all out.
637.56,639.36," It's kind of like, you know when you live with the cat,"
639.36,640.72," no one else is in the house,"
640.72,641.96," and the house settles, and the cat just goes"
641.96,644.12, and it's like staring at everything.
644.12,647.6," And it's like contagious, it's contagiously like freaky."
647.6,649.8, What the fuck is that?
649.8,651.56, So he's doing that the whole time.
651.56,653.48," But then as you're playing, you look over it,"
653.48,655.44," it's dude, all of a sudden you're playing death match,"
655.44,656.9200000000001," split screen, and you look at a screen"
656.9200000000001,659.28," and you're like, you see his side just staying in there"
659.28,661.48, because of course you're looking in everyone else's screen.
661.48,663.52," And you look over at him and he's like,"
663.52,666.76, asleep with like a burning cigarette in his hand.
666.76,669.08," And then the laugh, so you go, okay man,"
669.08,670.4," hey, you know, you wake him up a bit."
670.4,673.12," Hey, we're gonna go, like his, it was fun."
673.12,674.88," And then he just freaking, no, no."
674.88,677.24, He just like pops up in the instant alert.
677.24,678.6800000000001, This starts playing again.
678.6800000000001,679.96, It starts shooting you though.
680.96,682.76, And then you can go on like that forever.
682.76,684.48," And then if you just send it as soon as you wanted to say,"
684.48,685.96," hey, but we got to get out of here."
685.96,689.4," He would just go back, pop back in the life or load"
689.4,691.88, you still load up the glass pipe.
691.88,694.28, I haven't heard from this guy in so long.
694.28,695.28, It's just inevitable.
695.28,697.64," I mean, that was definitely when he was, yeah,"
697.64,699.56, approaching serious psychosis.
699.56,702.6," If you're still alive, send us a note here, so we know."
702.6,703.92, I'm pretty sure that you're on the med.
703.92,707.2, There aren't a lot of like total twakers that listen
707.2,708.84, to the GFW podcast.
708.84,710.0, Oh yeah.
710.0,711.28," If you're a twaker, right?"
711.28,713.64, That was Robert Ashley wrong.
713.64,716.52," That was a twaker, twaker's unites."
716.52,717.36, I'm afraid.
717.36,718.8, That's our demographic.
718.8,721.64, So I think they were going to sleep.
721.64,722.64, I'm funny.
722.64,723.64, I'm funny.
723.64,724.64," No, it's not a clue."
724.64,725.64, Of course you play like the action games.
725.64,727.12, I think it's more like it's more.
727.12,729.12, Any RPGs with a turn-based game.
729.12,730.12," Yes, this shit."
730.12,731.12, And it's the players turn.
731.12,733.6," You know, that's when I'm like, oh, yeah, that's terrible."
733.6,735.48," Or any kind of thing, any kind of game where there's a low in the"
735.48,737.16," action, you just have like a wander from point eight to point eight to point"
737.16,738.16, to game.
738.16,740.4," But it's also this ability I have in the same way that you know, when I was"
740.4,744.3199999999999," a kid, and if I knew I had to go to the bathroom, I would just go to the bathroom."
744.3199999999999,747.28," So if I know I'm getting tired, I just stop playing the game."
747.28,750.9599999999999," I'm not the kid who would just be like, accident."
750.9599999999999,757.68, It's just basically what you're admitting to be.
757.68,759.24, But for a game.
759.24,761.24," Well, you get to know."
761.24,764.72," But if you're super hooked on the game and especially with the turn-based game,"
764.72,768.04," it's always happening with heroes of mine magic, because I was so addicted to that game."
768.04,771.52," I wanted to know what the computer was going to do next, because I wanted to get him back"
771.52,772.52, on my next turn.
772.52,773.52, Right.
773.52,775.68," So I'd be sitting there and I'd just be fighting it to be like, I know I should"
775.68,776.68, get a bad.
776.68,777.68, It's two in the morning.
777.68,778.68, Just one more turn.
778.68,783.3199999999999," But if his move goes fast, I can get one just one more in."
783.3199999999999,786.68," And I would just fight that into the last until all the sudden, I'm realizing, you know,"
786.68,788.88, I'm waking up and it's like a half an hour has gone by.
788.88,792.68," His turn might have been over 25 minutes ago, and I've just been."
792.68,794.64," You know, you don't even have to play truth or dare."
794.64,796.8," We're so like, we're coming."
796.88,798.88, I don't want your tail.
798.88,802.04, It's a video game podcast.
802.04,804.3599999999999, There's no pretense of cool here.
804.3599999999999,805.56, I've never had a play.
805.56,810.12, Playing games when I wasn't shit face drunk.
810.12,811.12, When you haven't been?
811.12,814.3199999999999," Yeah, I mean, it was definitely not because I was just tired."
814.3199999999999,815.3199999999999, Right.
815.3199999999999,818.12, You play games drunk with friends and stuff.
818.12,819.5999999999999, That's like by myself.
819.5999999999999,824.88," I'm not exclusively a PC gamer, so I've got friends who come over."
825.84,826.8, What's with that slide?
826.8,828.24, It's cool.
828.24,833.88," You sit on a couch and you have other, you know, a couple controllers, spears,"
833.88,835.12, it's fun.
835.12,837.6," It's interesting that you aired that you're like,"
837.6,839.24," say, because I've heard about this."
839.24,841.4," Like this one guy was telling me you had a few play,"
841.4,843.24, Halo splits screen with the meth addict.
846.24,848.32," Hey, let's talk about reminds me."
848.32,852.76, Let's take this opportunity to talk about this one photo in our new issue.
852.76,853.48, Can we do that?
853.48,855.16, Who got here we go?
855.16,858.4," If you'll turn to you listen or sit on him, if you have here,"
858.4,860.88," November 2007, is it in subscribers?"
860.88,861.24, You have to.
861.24,863.12, Are they probably not having to have a ship?
863.12,863.88," Oh, no one has yet."
863.88,864.5600000000001, Never mind.
864.5600000000001,865.5600000000001, When you do get it.
865.5600000000001,868.5600000000001," If you see this, go back to this podcast."
868.5600000000001,872.0, There's a photo on page.
872.0,873.88, And you get a trouble for this.
873.88,878.44, There's a photo on page 97 of our magazine that's a shot
878.44,882.6, of these guys playing with the fru-fuckers and shot
882.6,883.44, on.
883.44,885.0400000000001," Shut up, I think."
885.0400000000001,886.52, That's not a good start to the story.
886.52,888.8000000000001," Anyway, it's one of those manufactured shots"
888.8000000000001,891.6, where publishers will make what the saw is showing
891.6,894.16, shows like happy wholesome looking gamers playing a game.
894.16,896.84," And they're like, one guy's like pumping both fists"
896.84,900.2, in his air because he's just made some amazing head shot
900.2,901.0, or something.
901.0,904.08," Except if he look at the photo, they all have the same god damn"
904.08,905.96, thing on their screen.
905.96,907.28, And it's not even the game.
907.28,908.28, You track screen.
908.28,910.9200000000001," Yeah, it's like the box art."
910.92,912.88, And it's one guy in the very front.
912.88,913.68," It's like, yeah."
913.68,917.36, I love the screen shot.
917.36,917.88, Yeah.
917.88,920.0799999999999, But guy behind him though has this look like he's like
920.0799999999999,921.28, really in the middle.
921.28,922.28," It's a little like, yeah."
922.28,923.4399999999999, That's definitely happening.
923.4399999999999,924.0799999999999, It's best to write.
924.0799999999999,924.5999999999999," Oh yeah, yeah."
924.5999999999999,925.0799999999999, Right.
925.0799999999999,928.4399999999999, You got the other guys leaning closely in with both hands.
928.4399999999999,930.24, He's doing some elaborate keystroke there.
930.24,931.4399999999999," Oh, it's totally the box art."
931.4399999999999,932.28, They all have the same.
932.28,933.28," Yeah, they have the box art."
933.28,936.48, So that's that's what your multiplayer.
936.48,938.16, That's what we get on the PC Robert.
938.16,940.4399999999999, Maybe you get a whole crowd platform game.
940.44,942.44, You just got someone fired.
942.44,943.44, I think.
943.44,946.44," Yeah, probably myself."
946.44,948.2," Yeah, the guy in the background's hands are all like"
948.2,951.24, contorted like he's playing the most like hardcore speed piano
951.24,953.0," no, ever written in this face."
953.0,956.24," It's just like, it's like, I got to say this."
956.24,957.96," It just, I'm bringing this up."
957.96,960.2, It's like the moment we're very passive aggressive with me.
960.2,960.48, Yeah.
960.48,963.72, So I'll just be aggressive aggressive and say that this bucks are
963.72,968.2800000000001, shit at me because like this is this is the insert to our
968.28,969.28, magazine.
969.28,970.8, Games are going to see for some magazine.
970.8,973.4, So Microsoft gets four pages to talk about whatever the hell they
973.4,976.8, want in their in their little advertising supplement here.
976.8,977.64, We don't write it.
977.64,978.8, We don't edit it.
978.8,979.92, We don't have anything to do with it.
979.92,980.92, They put it in.
980.92,981.92, And so they did this article.
981.92,986.04, It's about like why games for Windows live is so cool.
986.04,989.0799999999999," And one of the things is that you can play games with your buddies,"
989.0799999999999,992.4," live together, and they take a photo to prove it."
992.4,994.04, So take a real fucking photo.
994.04,995.04, What are they?
995.04,997.04, What's wrong with this bullshit on the screens?
997.12,1000.28," I can, I can, and what gamers going to be fooled by that shot."
1000.28,1003.16," I mean, that shot's like for our moms."
1003.16,1005.1999999999999, Anyone who actually reads this magazine is going to look at that and
1005.1999999999999,1006.5999999999999," it goes, what's this bullshit?"
1006.5999999999999,1010.5999999999999, So what did he say they were doing with that?
1010.5999999999999,1014.4399999999999, I can tell you that the problem with taking real shot is that these
1014.4399999999999,1016.28, people are pretty.
1016.28,1017.28, And that's what I know.
1017.28,1018.28, That's true.
1018.28,1019.28, They're not gamers.
1019.28,1020.28, It's a real shot.
1020.28,1022.88," It's all, is it also, are they're pretty gamers period?"
1022.88,1023.88," Well, yeah."
1023.88,1026.52, It looks like it's also like Girl Scout cookie outwards.
1026.52,1029.12," Like there's an Asian guy, a white dude, black dude."
1029.12,1030.08," Yeah, you got the rainbow."
1030.08,1030.76, You're a little cool.
1030.76,1033.52," He's a little like, he's a little like, he's a little like,"
1033.52,1036.16, there's Barack Obama in the bag.
1036.16,1038.16, That's just I did colors of shadow.
1038.16,1039.0," Oh, good."
1039.0,1040.12, Nice.
1040.12,1043.04," Anyway, this is a VR last podcast."
1043.04,1044.44, It's games for Windows.
1044.44,1045.6399999999999, Yeah.
1045.6399999999999,1049.12, We'll come back next week as something else.
1049.12,1052.48," We love the platform, though."
1052.48,1053.76," Let's just, I can't say this."
1053.76,1057.2, Here's a screen teasing us with the camera.
1057.2,1058.2, You can do it.
1058.2,1059.2, Just do it.
1059.2,1060.2, Do it off the mic.
1060.2,1064.8," Robert, Robert, actually brought in these amazing ginger thins."
1064.8,1067.56, And then ginger thins.
1067.56,1068.56, What are these like?
1068.56,1069.56, So create something?
1069.56,1070.56, There's sponsors.
1070.56,1071.56," Oh, yeah."
1071.56,1072.56, There's a sweetest flag right there.
1072.56,1073.56," Hey, well, are you idiots?"
1073.56,1074.56," Yeah, he is special."
1074.56,1075.56, Each of your crackers?
1075.56,1076.56, Yeah.
1076.56,1077.56, I'll get a drop of here of the web then.
1077.56,1078.56," Oh, awesome."
1078.56,1081.96," And we come back and maybe Bobby, you don't got a story to tell."
1081.96,1082.96, Okay.
1082.96,1087.52, So I got this in my PM box.
1087.52,1091.16," And I'll just, this is a different kind of here of the web."
1091.16,1093.1200000000001," This wouldn't, I don't know."
1093.1200000000001,1095.1200000000001, Is he still a hero though?
1095.1200000000001,1096.8400000000001, Tony passed me that pipe.
1096.8400000000001,1098.1200000000001," Oh, okay."
1098.1200000000001,1103.64," Anthony, you and Mongo, Mongo is his screen name says."
1103.64,1106.8400000000001, I know probably be attacked for this.
1106.8400000000001,1108.64, You're right.
1108.64,1112.56," Video games are for losers, et cetera."
1112.56,1117.44, But this is exactly how I felt when I had to kill the companion cube.
1117.44,1119.52, I honestly didn't know what to do.
1119.52,1121.6399999999999, I was pretty much in the days.
1121.6399999999999,1122.6399999999999, I would open love.
1122.6399999999999,1124.6399999999999, I would open portals over lava.
1124.6399999999999,1127.6399999999999, I'd forget that the last one I opened put me in front of a turret.
1127.6399999999999,1129.48, Completely ignored the energy balls.
1129.48,1133.08, I would just stand around the enrichment center in the days.
1133.08,1135.48, I didn't see any point who advancing the start.
1135.48,1137.28, How could it be cake without it?
1137.28,1142.52," Well, it takes some time, but I got over it and took my revenge on Glottos."
1142.6,1145.16," And the point is, I'm sure you will too."
1145.16,1147.08, There's anything I take from this.
1147.08,1150.92," It's that life goes on, either even after losing a loved one."
1150.92,1153.44, It's just up to you how long it takes.
1153.44,1155.08, Good don't let's just.
1155.08,1163.72," So the thing there is that if you remember and if you've been listening for far too long,"
1163.72,1166.4," this is a parody of it, so this is fake."
1166.4,1168.4, It's a parody of a real hero of the web.
1168.4,1173.5600000000002, That was the guy who was basically the exact same state but over the death of Eris
1173.5600000000002,1176.0800000000002, in Final Fantasy VII.
1176.0800000000002,1177.68, And it was like a word for word.
1177.68,1179.3200000000002," You know, just tweaking of that."
1179.3200000000002,1182.52, How he let his choke elbows go to hell or whatever.
1182.52,1188.3200000000002, He wandered the stupid planes and utterly apathetic and it took him weeks to bring himself
1188.3200000000002,1190.44, to go and kill Sephiroth or whatever.
1190.44,1191.44," So yeah, I thought that was funny."
1191.44,1196.48, I had to break fashion and give one who had concocted one.
1196.48,1198.0, He had taken the shout out.
1198.08,1199.0, With any responses.
1199.0,1201.88, And the fact that he remembered clearly he was writing off the script.
1201.88,1206.16," So yeah, he found the old one and then just hooked it up."
1206.16,1207.16, I'm kudos.
1207.16,1210.04, So can we transition into a portal for that?
1210.04,1211.28, Something brought that up.
1211.28,1212.56, We can we can just.
1212.56,1215.56, Let's talk about portal.
1215.56,1216.56, Let's do it.
1216.56,1217.56, Yeah.
1217.56,1219.12," Who might say, let's talk about that shit."
1219.12,1220.12, We don't have to.
1220.12,1223.8, We still won't spoil because I think a couple of us haven't finished.
1223.8,1224.8, You finished?
1224.8,1225.8, I finished.
1225.8,1226.8, I finished.
1226.8,1227.8, I finished.
1227.8,1228.8, I finished.
1228.8,1229.8, I finished.
1229.8,1231.8, So we won't spoil.
1231.8,1232.8," However, we will say."
1232.8,1233.8, We should.
1233.8,1236.8, What if one of the great endings ever?
1236.8,1237.8, You made it shy.
1237.8,1238.8, That should I show for sure.
1238.8,1240.8, I should not walk out for a second or that.
1240.8,1241.8, Okay.
1241.8,1242.8, Let's just go.
1242.8,1244.8, It's just it's phenomenal.
1244.8,1246.8, It's just how well that game builds up.
1246.8,1249.2, It's it's so because it's like we've been talking around.
1249.2,1251.3999999999999," Well, mainly because I played it a little earlier."
1251.3999999999999,1252.3999999999999, And I'm not bright.
1252.3999999999999,1254.3999999999999," I'm just saying as a matter of course, since I did the review."
1254.3999999999999,1255.3999999999999, I always argue.
1255.4,1256.4, I'm not going to say it.
1256.4,1261.52, You want to make it a point to say I'm not because I find it so tacky and wretched when
1261.52,1264.64, people spend so much time bragging about how.
1264.64,1270.96," Well, if you remember the first time that I broke the news to the world, I heard"
1270.96,1272.2800000000002, it was crazy fingered.
1272.2800000000002,1275.6000000000001, I find that I found it incredibly fun.
1275.6000000000001,1277.6000000000001, Even the lengths didn't particularly bother me.
1277.6000000000001,1278.6000000000001, No.
1278.6000000000001,1279.6000000000001, I felt like just enough portal.
1279.6000000000001,1281.6000000000001, I couldn't imagine it being longer actually.
1281.6000000000001,1285.3600000000001," It's weird because most of the forum posts I see always seem to start like,"
1286.1599999999999,1287.6," it's really short, but it's awesome."
1287.6,1289.08, And it's always starts off with that.
1289.08,1290.08, It's really short.
1290.08,1293.76," And it's so annoying because it's like, do you ever stop to think it's awesome"
1293.76,1294.76, because it's short?
1294.76,1295.76, Not it's great.
1295.76,1298.04," But it's short, but it's great."
1298.04,1301.0," You know, I mean, and you see that like I said, it's every thread."
1301.0,1304.32," I can't wait till modern start, make it at own levels with this thing."
1304.32,1307.08," Honestly, but that's just something that's not the length."
1307.08,1310.9599999999998," If you charge what they're charging on steam for this thing, and you buy this game,"
1311.04,1312.32, it's worth your money.
1312.32,1315.72, It's excellent because it's the length that it is.
1315.72,1316.72, Mm-hmm.
1316.72,1321.44," I mean, if it just, if it was too much longer, it would just become the series of"
1322.44,1323.24, test puzzles.
1323.24,1324.08," Yeah, I agree."
1324.08,1325.28, I thought it was long enough.
1325.28,1327.3600000000001," By the time you get to 19, that's it."
1327.3600000000001,1330.72, I have a complete gaming experience in one session.
1330.72,1332.3600000000001," And like, how often does that happen?"
1332.3600000000001,1334.3600000000001," And it was like, wow, that was three hours."
1334.3600000000001,1335.3600000000001, And it's awesome.
1335.3600000000001,1336.3600000000001, Beautiful.
1336.3600000000001,1339.76," You know, it all builds up to just like a fucking amazing finale."
1339.76,1341.8," Yeah, and why are we resistant to this idea?"
1341.8,1344.84," It's like, I've got all these, all these other online games that we're talking about,"
1344.84,1346.72, multiplayer games that I all be playing.
1346.72,1349.12," And so it's like, I mean, it's perfect."
1349.12,1350.12, It's great.
1350.12,1352.96," Hey, you feel satisfied when you go to a movie and it's an hour's half."
1352.96,1353.96," Yeah, right."
1353.96,1354.84, I was just about to bring that up.
1354.84,1355.84, Right.
1355.84,1357.8," And you can have the opposite experience in movies, too, right?"
1357.8,1360.0," I mean, that, I mean, this is just an old old point."
1360.0,1363.04," The three hour movie can be, can feel like six hours."
1363.04,1364.84," Or like, see, like, two minutes."
1364.84,1365.84, Yeah.
1365.84,1366.64, It's just in the base on the quality.
1366.64,1369.4, It's like finding the right length for what it is you want to do.
1369.48,1371.92, And that's like a freedom.
1371.92,1373.8000000000002, The games generally just don't have.
1373.8000000000002,1378.0," You don't make the length is determined in advance, largely, or at least a frame,"
1378.0,1382.3600000000001," a suitable, a suitable window of maximum hours to play."
1382.3600000000001,1383.8000000000002, There's a whole bunch of people.
1383.8000000000002,1386.5600000000002," It, there've been the, you know, is this game of the year?"
1386.5600000000002,1387.68, Threads everywhere.
1387.68,1390.48," And a lot of people are saying, well, I can't be because it's too short."
1390.48,1393.2800000000002," Well, I absolutely fundamentally disagree with that."
1393.2800000000002,1395.3600000000001, I do think it's one of the best games of the year.
1395.3600000000001,1397.72, And I'll give a shit that it was as short as it was.
1397.8,1403.0," It seems like people just always approach games as if they were some sort of,"
1403.0,1406.1200000000001," like, product that you could buy at the grocery store."
1406.1200000000001,1409.16," Like, this contains only four ounces of gaming."
1409.16,1411.32, How could it possibly be a worse one?
1411.32,1413.32, I can't believe it's not game.
1413.32,1414.32, Yeah.
1414.32,1417.8," It's not, it's not a bottle of coke."
1417.8,1418.44, Yeah.
1418.44,1418.8, Yeah.
1418.8,1420.2," I mean, yeah."
1420.2,1423.32, It's difficult because of the price at times.
1423.32,1427.52," Like, I can understand why people will, will impose different standards."
1427.68,1429.8799999999999," For something, they're paying $60 on versus something."
1429.8799999999999,1431.2, They're paying $10 on.
1431.2,1433.24, I understand it to some extent.
1433.24,1438.36," This are arbitrary, like, these arbitrary rubrics that gamers settle into, you know,"
1438.36,1440.72, when they want to evaluate the quality of things.
1440.72,1442.4," I mean, I have to, I mean, have to tell you,"
1442.4,1444.6, and they're evaluating the value more than the quality.
1444.6,1444.96, Right.
1444.96,1445.16, Yes.
1445.16,1447.28," Even when they want to evaluate the quality, it's so weird."
1447.28,1449.08," And again, it emphasized the word arbitrary."
1449.08,1455.8799999999999," In the IGN review, for example, the reviewer criticized team fortress, too,"
1455.96,1460.2800000000002," because unlike Halo 3, you're unable to customize your character."
1460.2800000000002,1463.92," If you have an engineer, you look like any other engineer."
1463.92,1468.1200000000001," He wants to be able to put, like, a task tattoo or something on him."
1468.1200000000001,1470.8400000000001," But yeah, again, it's like, and in the same way,"
1470.8400000000001,1472.1200000000001, there's another example I've used.
1472.1200000000001,1473.8000000000002," When people, you know, come in to show a game."
1473.8000000000002,1476.3200000000002," They're like, hey, this is a 10 player game or 12 player game."
1476.3200000000002,1477.4," Everyone goes, what?"
1477.4,1479.8000000000002," Not 32, not 64, not 89."
1479.8000000000002,1480.8000000000002, No.
1480.8000000000002,1481.8400000000001, What the fuck you talking about?
1481.8400000000001,1485.0800000000002," Like, it should, a game should be designed to suit as many players"
1485.08,1487.0, as whatever they're trying to accomplish.
1487.0,1488.0," Yeah, I know."
1488.0,1492.36," So yeah, I mean, again, people just get trapped in these really, really"
1492.36,1496.32," bizarre and arbitrary, you know, grids that they evaluate things by."
1496.32,1498.4399999999998," And it makes so little sense to come in one as, you know,"
1498.4399999999998,1500.24, number of maps and a multiplayer game.
1500.24,1500.8, All right.
1500.8,1502.24," Number of weapons, number of classes."
1502.24,1505.6799999999998," And of course, you know, the journalists, which we are part of,"
1505.6799999999998,1509.12," but I try to add these questions, is that being the first question"
1509.12,1510.1599999999999, that you're math and interviewing?
1510.1599999999999,1512.04," Well, how many maps does it have?"
1512.04,1514.32," You know, how about like one good one?"
1514.32,1515.1599999999999, That'd be fine.
1515.1599999999999,1516.6, This goes back like King Fortress 2.
1516.6,1517.6, How many right now?
1517.6,1518.2, Right.
1518.2,1518.6, Has it?
1518.6,1518.96, Has it?
1518.96,1519.96, That was so big.
1519.96,1520.8, Awesome.
1520.8,1522.8799999999999, Remember when Shadow Run was coming out?
1522.8799999999999,1523.08, Yeah.
1523.08,1526.48," And I'll talk about Shadow Run was always, well, it has two few maps."
1526.48,1527.1599999999999, It has two few maps.
1527.1599999999999,1530.3999999999999," And I was like on the record saying, well, I think that's stupid because of the game"
1530.3999999999999,1533.04," itself isn't that good, who gives a shit about the maps."
1533.04,1536.0, And I think people are focusing on the maps because it's the one of the objective
1536.0,1537.0, things.
1537.0,1537.84, It's a got a number attached to it.
1537.84,1540.76, So we can all agree that this is a deficiency.
1540.76,1545.4," But again, like no one, no one partially to be fair with Team Fortress 2 because we all"
1545.4,1549.52," know that at least if you own the PC version, you're going to be getting maps."
1549.52,1551.8," And I'm sure if you in 360, they're going to get them to anyway."
1551.8,1552.8, I'm sure.
1552.8,1553.8, I'll see you soon.
1553.8,1554.8, Yeah.
1554.8,1555.8, So that's there.
1555.8,1557.44," But again, it's like you're having so much fun."
1557.44,1559.8, You want to like play and get good on each one there.
1559.8,1561.28, You're thinking about this game so fun.
1561.28,1562.28, That's your first impression.
1562.28,1564.2, They got to figure out why it's fun.
1564.2,1566.8799999999999, But it's like it's not because there's X number of maps.
1566.8799999999999,1567.8799999999999, Right.
1567.8799999999999,1570.72, If Shadow Run itself had been totally fun and the map.
1571.28,1572.44, We're good ones.
1572.44,1574.52, Nobody would have been complaining about how many they were.
1574.52,1576.88," They would have been, yeah, they would have been what is being playing it."
1576.88,1577.88, Right.
1577.88,1578.88, I think this is all.
1578.88,1581.32, And there are enough people to play that they would have made new maps form.
1581.32,1582.32, Right.
1582.32,1583.68, Which is what will happen with Team Fortress.
1583.68,1584.68, Yes.
1584.68,1589.2, It's all just another consequence of this weird bullet point thing that we have with
1589.2,1593.44," games, which I think is actually like a part of the way that games have been reviewed for"
1593.44,1597.32, a long time to break them out and to like how many guns does it have?
1597.32,1599.84, And how many levels does it have?
1599.9199999999998,1600.84, What are the new enemies?
1600.84,1601.84, Yeah.
1601.84,1602.84," You know, like all the Halo covers."
1602.84,1603.84, You see it is like that.
1603.84,1607.6799999999998, I want to know all the details of every Halo vehicle.
1607.6799999999998,1610.1999999999998, That's the most like wanking thing I've ever heard of.
1610.1999999999998,1612.1999999999998," I just, I'm sorry."
1612.1999999999998,1618.48, But I just don't know about the experience of playing the game and not all these little
1618.48,1620.6, fetishized objects.
1620.6,1624.08, And we've broke it all apart into these little categories and now we can't see the
1624.08,1625.9599999999998, forest for the trees ever.
1625.9599999999998,1627.9599999999998, It's really bizarre.
1628.04,1628.96, Yeah.
1628.96,1632.04, But grab a bit of this vehicle has eight wheels.
1632.04,1638.1200000000001, And I'll give you an exclusive screen of that and then the weather magazine has it.
1638.1200000000001,1644.28," And if you press right mouse button, there's a small screen that comes out."
1644.28,1647.28, No one else even knows that yet.
1647.28,1648.28," Oh, you'd be the first."
1648.28,1649.28, And there's the cover.
1649.28,1651.28, There's a cover story.
1651.28,1654.28," So, all right."
1654.28,1655.28, So back to Fortal.
1655.28,1657.92, How many hours did it take you guys to finish?
1658.3600000000001,1658.92, At the end of the day.
1658.92,1659.92, It's a few by the member.
1659.92,1662.92, It's like the opposite of a cock bearing contact.
1662.92,1664.92, I'm saying because it's like a golf scored.
1664.92,1665.92, I'm not a rag.
1665.92,1667.92," No, it's a part of that hole."
1667.92,1668.92, It took me a long time.
1668.92,1669.92, Which is why.
1669.92,1670.92, 35 minutes.
1670.92,1671.92, I'm not bragging.
1671.92,1672.92, That's not why I'm bringing it up.
1672.92,1674.92, It took me over six hours.
1674.92,1677.92," Well, most of us in men said claim you know, 23."
1677.92,1678.92, 20 30 minutes.
1678.92,1681.92, I could only go by this team thing to put seven hours.
1681.92,1682.92, That's pretty.
1682.92,1683.92, Frequent fast.
1683.92,1685.92, I think I took four or five hours.
1685.92,1687.92, I'm blaming age for my six.
1687.92,1688.92, Yeah.
1688.92,1692.92," I haven't made it into the level 19 yet, which I hear is the hell level."
1692.92,1694.92," Well, 18 and 19 are both hard."
1694.92,1696.92," Well, I'm pretty foreign to 18 and the other one's point."
1696.92,1699.92, I got more stumped by 18 than 19.
1699.92,1700.92, Yeah.
1700.92,1701.92, My excuse to equivalent of it was cold.
1701.92,1703.92, Is that I was taking some.
1703.92,1704.92, Okay.
1704.92,1705.92, Shriekage.
1705.92,1706.92, I was taking screenshots.
1706.92,1707.92, Yeah.
1707.92,1708.92, Yeah.
1708.92,1710.92, Taking screenshots for the reviews.
1710.92,1713.92, I wanted to bring this up because of because steam.
1713.92,1716.92," You know, keeps track of the shit and no pressure."
1716.92,1720.92, And it's just this thing about we talked about a little before we turned the mics on.
1720.92,1721.92, The steam community.
1721.92,1723.92, I'm just finding it is sort of weird thing.
1723.92,1728.92, It's like this kind of intrusion into my single player gaming experience.
1728.92,1730.92, It like I can be observed that way.
1730.92,1733.92," And in fact, it's going to sound like bullshit."
1733.92,1737.92, But I left the game on overnight when I'm Friday night.
1737.92,1740.92," And so when I woke up the next morning, you know,"
1740.92,1743.92, it had logged on like seven more hours of portal.
1743.92,1744.92, Then I really had been playing.
1744.92,1746.92, It was just sitting on the pause screen.
1746.92,1748.92, That counted towards the time.
1748.92,1749.92, So that is the score.
1749.92,1750.92, This is my story.
1750.92,1751.92, And this is my story.
1751.92,1752.92, Yeah.
1752.92,1753.92, And this is the story.
1753.92,1755.92, So I was playing half like that.
1755.92,1757.92, So it's like finished portal that next day on Saturday.
1757.92,1758.92, But on Sunday.
1758.92,1761.92, I was playing up so two and all of a sudden in the middle of that game.
1761.92,1766.92," You know, steam community window pops up and it's some random dude who accepted as a"
1766.92,1767.92, friend.
1767.92,1769.92," He's like, Oh, ha dude, 17 hours on portal."
1769.92,1770.92," Well, loser."
1770.92,1775.92, I don't know you.
1775.92,1777.92, You fell asleep at when you had a.
1777.92,1780.92," And then it was like, man, okay, it wasn't 17 hours."
1780.92,1783.92, That's just how many hours the game was on.
1783.92,1784.92, It didn't take me that long to get through.
1784.92,1787.92," But then I thought like, how weird it is that like, you know,"
1787.92,1790.92, people can see your in the single player game.
1790.92,1792.92," It was kind of like, it was on my mind while I was playing."
1792.92,1794.92," I'm just like, people are going to know I better go fast."
1794.92,1796.92, You're not talking to the player game.
1796.92,1797.92, Right.
1797.92,1798.92, Right.
1798.92,1799.92, It's a weird thing about steam.
1799.92,1800.92," I mean, I love steam."
1800.92,1802.92, I'm still definitely on the bandwagon.
1802.92,1805.92," But it was weird that like, first of all, that my single player game could be."
1805.92,1806.92, My performance could be observed.
1806.92,1810.92," But then also while I'm playing another single player game, someone could just randomly"
1810.92,1813.92, come on and disney about the other game I was playing.
1813.92,1818.92," That element work is so perfectly suited to portals narrative though, and it's"
1818.92,1819.92, themes.
1819.92,1820.92, It really is.
1820.92,1821.92," Oh, it's totally is."
1821.92,1822.92, Perfect.
1822.92,1823.92, Yeah.
1823.92,1824.92, Yeah.
1824.92,1825.92," And just the fact that, yeah, you're a guinea pig."
1825.92,1829.92," I mean, you're being observed and you don't, you know, right, you're communicating"
1829.92,1831.92, through indirectly through your actions.
1831.92,1832.92, Can you clear your score?
1832.92,1835.92," Can you, can you, can, can you, can you, can, is there a way to like reset your,"
1835.92,1836.92, or does that play a lot more?
1836.92,1837.92, I just can't.
1837.92,1838.92," I just like, you guys, can I?"
1838.92,1841.92," No, no, really, it doesn't bother me."
1841.92,1842.92, They have a pill for this.
1842.92,1846.92," The Elvis prepping is for the combine and we're going to use this information to,"
1846.92,1849.92," yeah, for where you're meeting that EA exact failed."
1850.92,1853.92, You can just tell everyone that you need to spend some quality time with your companion
1853.92,1854.92, cube.
1854.92,1856.92," Before the portal equipment of the sea, I'll assume."
1856.92,1861.92," I'm thinking of not a sea Alice, but I'm thinking of like, um, unit lengthener."
1861.92,1864.92," You know, unit lengthening pills."
1864.92,1865.92, Yeah.
1865.92,1871.92," Can I say about portal that I think the cake is a lie is now going to be, like,"
1871.92,1875.92," like the most classic video game saying, like I can imagine about thinking about that"
1875.92,1876.92, every time I finish a game.
1876.92,1877.92, Yeah.
1877.92,1879.92," Yeah, I'm sure the shirts are already made."
1879.92,1881.28," This is a year that I'll say,"
1881.28,1882.92," great, but which kind of lease."
1882.92,1885.92," So it's a good year for, yeah."
1885.92,1886.92," Yeah, right."
1886.92,1887.92, Good stuff.
1887.92,1888.92, Good stuff.
1888.92,1890.92, I think they enjoyed a portal.
1890.92,1895.92," You got some other spam when you were, uh, when you're playing."
1895.92,1896.92, Huh?
1896.92,1897.92," Oh, for you."
1897.92,1898.92, Yeah.
1898.92,1900.92," Well, that was sitting there waiting for me the next day."
1900.92,1902.92," Oh, with portal that was on all night."
1902.92,1903.92, Let's turn the bombard you.
1903.92,1905.92," Yeah, I had spam from from Sean."
1905.92,1909.92, He had like wrap rants sitting on my window.
1909.92,1911.92, I got a freaking disabled statement.
1911.92,1915.92," Oh, there's the lyrics that came up on the top of the show."
1915.92,1918.92," Yeah, I was just facing some of those right now."
1918.92,1921.92," To, uh, and then you get like, we were talking about this too."
1921.92,1924.92," You get people and it's like, no, you know, so knock on them."
1924.92,1926.92," It's like, hey, I'm glad people want to add me their friends."
1926.92,1930.92," It's, but then you get a message and it's like, hey, and you say, okay."
1930.92,1931.92, How you do?
1931.92,1933.92," And then you say, like, who are you?"
1933.92,1937.92," And then they just go, oh my god, you don't know how it feels to be talking to, uh,"
1937.92,1939.92, the editor of a magazine.
1939.92,1943.92," And it's like, kind of awkward, you know, like I said earlier,"
1943.92,1946.92," it could, you should feel the same way when you talk to anyone."
1946.92,1950.92," You know, the guy you like fries your fries at Jack and a box or something."
1950.92,1952.92," You know, like, I mean, you made these fries."
1952.92,1955.92," I never thought it'd get to talk to you, sir."
1955.92,1957.92, The salty job was awesome.
1957.92,1958.92, It's delicious.
1958.92,1961.92," It's kind of cool, but I mean, you feel like such."
1961.92,1966.92," I might, my policy with that has been if I agree to accept anybody as a friend,"
1966.92,1971.92," because of course, it's an option on steam that I don't mind if anybody says hi,"
1971.92,1973.92," but I mean, it's a little weird."
1973.92,1976.92," I guess you guys told me before you turn it on, you can like show that you're offline or whatever,"
1976.92,1978.92, because it's a little annoying if I'm playing a single thing.
1978.92,1979.92, It's not that bad.
1979.92,1980.92, And those people aren't idiots.
1980.92,1984.92," I'm trying to, that feeling, you know, like, say, you just graduated high school"
1984.92,1987.92," and then the next year you go, you patrol the parking lot and you got like a new"
1987.92,1989.92, comer or something.
1989.92,1994.92," That's kind of like, that's the level of status I feel is just conferred."
1994.92,1997.92," Yeah, and you're like, okay, this is cool kids."
1997.92,2001.92," And then like, look around to make sure no other adults are seeing it, you know?"
2001.92,2003.92, That's actually a pretty fair analogy.
2003.92,2005.92, Do the coolest nerd in the room.
2005.92,2008.92," I see myself with that like, really pretty greasy mustache."
2008.92,2009.92," Like, roll the roll."
2009.92,2012.92," No, I, I just, I mean, to me, it's not about"
2012.92,2015.92, quarter and quarter celebrity.
2015.92,2018.92," Oh, you're serious about this."
2018.92,2022.92, It's more about just like it's random people talking when I'm trying to play a game.
2022.92,2024.92, That's more about that.
2024.92,2027.92," To me, it's more about dick pics."
2027.92,2028.92, K-thanks.
2028.92,2033.92, Yeah.
2033.92,2036.92," I mean, I'm not saying don't, don't PM me."
2036.92,2039.92," And in fact, most people who have, because I guess you can tell if they're playing, right?"
2039.92,2040.92," Yeah, I'm just saying, you're not playing."
2040.92,2042.92," Most people have said, like, sorry to bother you while you're playing."
2042.92,2043.92," Which is, which is cool."
2043.92,2044.92," Oh, man."
2044.92,2045.92, I just got it.
2045.92,2046.92," Yeah, but you are."
2046.92,2047.92, Just what I'm really telling you.
2047.92,2049.92," I was just thinking I'm like, most of the people on our friends,"
2049.92,2051.92, lists are shared right now.
2051.92,2054.92, Something going to have a range like to get everyone a bum bar to you next time.
2054.92,2055.92," Oh, thanks."
2055.92,2056.92, With some kind of off to think of some.
2056.92,2059.92," I've already ruined it now, but maybe I could find another way to do it."
2059.92,2060.92," Yeah, I know."
2060.92,2061.92, I'm only asking for it.
2061.92,2062.92," It's just, you know, just want to."
2062.92,2063.92, Yeah.
2063.92,2064.92, Great.
2064.92,2067.92, Now on installing steam.
2068.92,2070.92, Or perpetually offline.
2070.92,2075.92," So, well, to me, God, Bob, you know, before we come back, because we got a lot of it, we should stretch"
2075.92,2077.92, the now playing out since we have so much of it.
2077.92,2078.92, Yeah.
2078.92,2084.92," Last week, well, week before last, Bob, you don't want to tell a tale from Texas."
2084.92,2087.92," And as your shot, you only got one shot."
2087.92,2088.92, What would you do?
2088.92,2089.92, Why do you tell?
2089.92,2090.92, Why do you tell last time?
2090.92,2091.92, We ran out of time.
2091.92,2092.92, We got it.
2092.92,2093.92, We got your crunched.
2093.92,2095.92, We got a little's of it now.
2095.92,2096.92, Yeah.
2096.92,2101.92," So I had gone down to Plano to Plano, Texas, which is actually where my wife grew up, but it's where"
2101.92,2103.92, Gearbox says their offices.
2103.92,2109.92," So that was kind of surreal to visit the town where I went to, I finished high school and everything."
2109.92,2113.92, And there's actually games being made and crazy stuff to do.
2113.92,2117.92, But one of the things that took a business trip to your high school.
2117.92,2118.92, Yeah.
2118.92,2119.92, It was weird.
2119.92,2120.92, And it was in there.
2121.92,2127.92," There in the top four floors of the Bank of America building, Plano, which is the tallest building in Plano,"
2127.92,2128.92, Techno.
2128.92,2131.92," You know, like, 17 floors or something."
2131.92,2134.92," So they have, you know, status there."
2134.92,2139.92," But one of the things I did was I went out and shot some guns with Colonel Antel,"
2139.92,2141.92, the military advisor.
2141.92,2142.92, Yeah.
2142.92,2144.92," Oh, I thought they'd bring out all the time."
2144.92,2145.92, Yeah.
2145.92,2146.92, Yeah.
2146.92,2147.92, But I'm not doing something.
2147.92,2148.92, I'm not doing something.
2148.92,2149.92, I'm just kind of scary.
2149.92,2150.92, Yeah.
2150.92,2152.92," It was a, that's the guy who Mark Reyn."
2152.92,2159.92, When he was giving a demo and Mark Reyn was sitting there on top of it was talking about how it was an emotional roller coaster.
2159.92,2166.92," Reyn said that, well, he just commented on the fact that John used to use those very same hands to choke the life out of men."
2166.92,2170.92," And at this point, he's using him to hide his tears from playing his own video."
2170.92,2173.92, That's perspective on that.
2173.92,2174.92, Oh my God.
2174.92,2175.92, Wow.
2176.92,2178.92, Complete portrait of this character.
2178.92,2179.92, Yeah.
2179.92,2180.92, He's got an unusual job there.
2180.92,2182.92, They've got him writing a couple of books.
2182.92,2186.92," One of them has the Brothers and Arms name, like a typical fiction book."
2186.92,2189.92, That is pretty typical fiction.
2189.92,2192.92," And then, like, I got to say, I think I've checked to this now."
2192.92,2194.92, Now it's going a little too far.
2194.92,2195.92, Yeah.
2195.92,2196.92," Well, don't tell that to us."
2196.92,2201.92," This is what they're supposed to be basing, like, the basing this game on Hell's Highway, the book."
2201.92,2202.92, Yeah.
2203.92,2207.92," I mean, like, what the hell's coming out the other side of the, the looking glass now is a fiction-alized"
2207.92,2209.92, Roll towards a story based on a game?
2209.92,2210.92, It's not.
2210.92,2211.92, It's not.
2211.92,2212.92, She's a fucking break.
2212.92,2220.92," It's a completely devil's advocate and say that when they found the guy, I guess he'd been, he'd written a couple of historical fiction books that they had read and enjoyed."
2220.92,2222.92, And so that's why they sought him out to begin with.
2222.92,2224.92, And so that's what he does in general.
2224.92,2228.92, And I guess that they're just tying it in with the Brothers and Arms thing.
2228.92,2230.92, I don't think that it has anything to do with the game necessarily.
2230.92,2231.92, Just the name.
2231.92,2233.92, And they all work on the magic of the game.
2233.92,2238.92," But he's also doing like some a non-fiction book, which I didn't quite catch the, the just of."
2238.92,2244.92," But anyway, we go out to this gun range a couple miles away from their office."
2244.92,2250.92, It's issued some like a world war two like M1 and a couple other guns.
2250.92,2254.92, And we go in there and of course it's fucking bizarre because it's a Texas gun shop.
2254.92,2258.92, And the guys behind the counter have guns and holsters on them.
2258.92,2259.92, Yeah.
2259.92,2260.92, And they're allowed to wear that.
2260.92,2262.92, And that's that's funny or whatever.
2262.92,2265.92, But we're standing around waiting waiting for our lane.
2265.92,2272.92," And the guys who work at the shop know, and tall and all the gearbox people because they bring people over to shoot all the time."
2272.92,2273.92, Yeah.
2273.92,2274.92, And they start pitching games at them.
2274.92,2275.92, Like what?
2275.92,2280.92," Like the, like, little young guys like, you guys need to make a game about them."
2280.92,2281.92, Reads man.
2281.92,2283.92, You gotta make them a reams game.
2283.92,2286.92," And you know, just given them all this stuff."
2286.92,2292.92," And so, and tall goes into this explanation of, you know, no, you know, this is what brothers and arms is all about."
2292.92,2298.92," And you start talking about how, you know, it's all about giving you like eight days of a military experience."
2298.92,2302.92," And they're going to, you know, take brothers and arms from, you know,"
2302.92,2305.92, World War two all the way up to modern day some day.
2305.92,2307.92, And they were going to do all these different games.
2307.92,2311.92," And I made this off hand comment, you know, that it didn't really, it came out wrong."
2311.92,2314.92," I said, yeah, if you did, if you did, if you did,"
2315.92,2322.92," brothers and arms bagged at, it would be like seven days of playing Xbox followed by one day of getting blown up."
2322.92,2328.92," And it was so fucking awkward because what I meant to comment on was just that, you know,"
2328.92,2330.92, it's notoriously boring.
2330.92,2331.92, It's like the waiting around time.
2331.92,2332.92, Yeah.
2332.92,2333.92, Yeah.
2333.92,2336.92," Like, like, like I used to read EGM's letters for them, right?"
2336.92,2340.92," And we would get letters all the time from soldiers who would say that, you know, it's really boring."
2340.92,2343.92," And they spend most of their time sitting in the bear,"
2343.92,2344.92, exploring video games and stuff.
2344.92,2345.92, Right.
2345.92,2346.92, And we get those letters here.
2346.92,2347.92, We get that about this podcast.
2347.92,2351.92," Yeah, you're taking you for entertaining us because we sit around in, you know,"
2351.92,2353.92, is that commenting that they're still not statement there.
2353.92,2354.92," You're just saying, right?"
2354.92,2357.92, I've heard that there's a lot of weight.
2357.92,2360.92," But I think what he said when I said, he knew that I was, you know,"
2360.92,2362.92," that I live in Berkeley, California."
2362.92,2363.92, Right.
2363.92,2364.92, So yeah.
2364.92,2367.92," When he heard that, I think he thought it was a, you know, a journey."
2367.92,2369.92, So we like launched into a defense of it.
2369.92,2371.92," And I'm trying to like, you know, of what?"
2371.92,2372.92, Of course.
2372.92,2373.92, Yeah.
2373.92,2375.92, We got to stick it out and blah blah blah.
2375.92,2377.92, And I'm trying not to even get into the argument.
2377.92,2379.92, What these guys are wearing guns.
2379.92,2380.92, Yeah.
2380.92,2382.92," Well, and even like their gearboxes,"
2382.92,2386.92," he was with us and her, you know, her husband is in, is in bagged."
2386.92,2387.92, That's the best.
2387.92,2389.92, I don't even want to have this conversation.
2389.92,2390.92, I'm not trying to offend anyone.
2390.92,2393.92, And it was just really fucking awkward.
2393.92,2395.92, And I'm always having these awkward things happen.
2395.92,2396.92, I don't know why.
2396.92,2398.92," Did anyone let them with like, were they like, you want to, you?"
2398.92,2401.92," No, it was, it was, it was basically that I got to, like,"
2401.92,2402.92, I got a problem.
2402.92,2405.92, I got to lecture all the way back to the office in the truck.
2405.92,2407.92, Did anyone tell you to go to Cuba?
2407.92,2408.92, No.
2408.92,2409.92, I was not fighting it.
2409.92,2410.92," I was just like, uh-huh."
2410.92,2411.92, Yep.
2411.92,2412.92," True, true, true, true."
2412.92,2413.92, Yep.
2413.92,2414.92, Okay.
2414.92,2416.92," Did you get a chance to explain them like about the whole,"
2416.92,2417.92, Yeah.
2417.92,2419.92," I, I think I tried to, but I think the idea."
2419.92,2420.92, We know what you meant.
2420.92,2421.92, You're hippie.
2421.92,2422.92, I'm scared.
2422.92,2425.92," You're like myself, um, yeah, not cool."
2425.92,2428.92," Yeah, it's a good, that's a good, uh, I like that."
2428.92,2430.92, This is a bull rat issue right there.
2430.92,2432.92," But he was, he was a nice guy."
2432.92,2435.92," And it was, a lot, it was a lot more, it felt a lot more safe,"
2435.92,2436.92, shooting guns around.
2436.92,2439.92," Somebody, you actually, like, is teaching me what to do."
2439.92,2442.92," Oh, that's why that I shot guns with Sean Elliott and like,"
2442.92,2443.92, the UGM crew.
2443.92,2446.92," I'm talking, they're shooting like fucking dirty hairy guns and like,"
2446.92,2447.92, laughing.
2447.92,2449.92," Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,"
2449.92,2453.92," like, like, like, like, like a fucking episode."
2453.92,2456.92," I got the picture of my son, I was so, so, so, so."
2456.92,2459.92, I got the picture of my cell phone of the target with his nuts shot.
2459.92,2460.92, That's not all.
2460.92,2461.92, That's not all.
2461.92,2463.92," No, I mean, Sean was just doing it."
2463.92,2465.92, But it was definitely fun.
2465.92,2466.92," It was Sean, baby."
2466.92,2469.92," And yeah, that was really the, I was just, Hey, I was just a little"
2469.92,2470.92, flat house.
2470.92,2473.92," I was actually mad because the people next to us had DOOM Koch,"
2473.92,2476.92," which is like, uh, it's the Smith and West of model 50."
2476.92,2479.38," It's a model 50, a model 500, right?"
2479.38,2480.2200000000003, I'm getting wrong.
2480.2200000000003,2481.82," And it's a 50, a model 500."
2481.82,2483.66, And it's a 50 caliber revolver.
2483.66,2485.46, And all of a sudden it's gun talk.
2485.46,2486.62, It's entirely hell.
2486.62,2489.06," A bit real quick, because it's part of the mentality."
2489.06,2491.82," The paint you have picture if you've never been to, you know, ranges."
2491.82,2495.06," It's like, there's always some family there and they got pride and joy."
2495.06,2498.02," And it's like, in this case, it was the Smith and West of 500."
2498.02,2503.86," And if you've seen it, it makes like, you know, it makes the dirty hairy"
2503.86,2506.08, of the Magnum look like a toy.
2506.08,2507.08, Wow.
2507.08,2508.08, It's ridiculous.
2508.08,2509.08, It's like a gun.
2509.08,2510.08, It's a from a video game.
2510.08,2511.08, It's a gun from a video game.
2511.08,2514.7200000000003," And but it's the most, it sounds like, you know, a cannon going off every"
2514.7200000000003,2515.7200000000003, time.
2515.7200000000003,2517.1200000000003," And I was actually like, okay, this is annoying."
2517.1200000000003,2521.44," Like, because we're trying to like shoot and, I guess it was good field conditions."
2521.44,2524.8, If you wanted to see how you could fire it in saying distraction.
2524.8,2529.84," But it was really, because it wasn't just loud, it would actually like split the air around"
2529.84,2530.84, you.
2530.84,2531.84, Yeah.
2531.84,2534.44," It's like, you're sitting there trying to shoot in just every minute."
2534.44,2537.84, You hear this giant bag and shake your body.
2537.84,2541.84," And by the time I left, I felt like I had like, you know, post traumatic stress."
2541.84,2546.84," I mean, I just feel like, I got back to Berkeley and eat some mashed."
2546.84,2547.84, These.
2547.84,2548.84, Feel better.
2548.84,2549.84, Yeah.
2549.84,2555.28," It's a little bit of like, here's an engine block or something or I doubt this would fire"
2555.28,2556.28, from that.
2556.28,2560.36," I mean, you're probably thinking of a rifle version of 50 caliber."
2560.36,2562.6," But this thing, um, this is the barrel and stuff."
2562.6,2566.88, I bet that the slug has got to slow down after any significant distance.
2566.88,2569.88," I just, I don't really like to have this kind of weapon."
2569.88,2570.88, I don't really do.
2570.88,2572.88, I know more about the needler.
2572.88,2579.2000000000003," Well, the same reason if you're like, no, should we get the expedition or the excursion?"
2579.2000000000003,2580.2000000000003, Yeah.
2580.2000000000003,2581.2000000000003, There.
2581.2000000000003,2582.2000000000003, Or the Yukon.
2582.2000000000003,2583.2000000000003, Yeah.
2583.2000000000003,2584.2000000000003, It's bigger.
2584.2000000000003,2585.2000000000003, That one's here.
2585.2000000000003,2586.2000000000003, All right.
2586.2000000000003,2587.2000000000003, Get that one.
2587.2000000000003,2588.2000000000003, We're getting some hate mail now.
2588.72,2592.6," I've only been in a gun shop once and it's because an old freelancer,"
2592.6,2601.2799999999997," Raffa, a laboratory, a great guy who has a he as a military background and, uh, uh,"
2601.2799999999997,2605.2," special for lots of, yeah, lots of experiences, special forces."
2605.2,2611.7999999999997, And he took Robert coffee and I out shooting in San Diego and he brought us into a gun shop
2611.7999999999997,2613.0, to use their indoor range.
2613.0,2616.7599999999998, And we didn't have to like check out guns there because he had like an entire arsenal
2616.76,2618.0, store in his house.
2618.0,2618.8," Oh, that he, yeah."
2618.8,2623.2400000000002," He like went, we went down into his secret locked up room where he had like,"
2623.2400000000002,2624.5200000000004, it was like scary.
2624.5200000000004,2625.2400000000002, It was like something matter.
2625.2400000000002,2628.2400000000002," You know, like a 24 terrorist scene, you know."
2629.2400000000002,2629.44, Good.
2629.44,2630.4, I'm the machine guns.
2630.4,2631.84, That's what it was like.
2631.84,2636.88," So anyway, so we, uh, we lowered it up this whole locker thing full of guns."
2636.88,2639.92, And we drove over to this shop and I'd never been in a gun shop before.
2639.92,2642.1200000000003, Because I'm just not that kind of person.
2642.1200000000003,2646.32," And, uh, but the thing that I remember the most was as we were in the gun shop and"
2646.32,2647.96, filling out the little form to use their range.
2647.96,2653.32," They had for sale behind the counter targets, paper targets to use."
2653.32,2657.2400000000002," And I'm used to like from boy scouts, you know, back in the day they had like, you know,"
2657.2400000000002,2660.88," just the circles, you know, you're all standard bulls."
2660.88,2664.28," I, they had target cheats that were like,"
2664.28,2665.1200000000003, difference.
2665.1200000000003,2667.6800000000003, They were silhouettes of different ethnicities.
2667.6800000000003,2669.32," You know, yeah."
2669.32,2670.32, Yeah.
2670.32,2671.88," I thought you were, I was waiting for the song, a thing."
2671.88,2675.28," I'm like, well, I was kind of like for that and depending on the decade and what"
2675.36,2679.84," you go to the range, then it was, uh, who's saying, and then it was comedy."
2679.84,2682.0400000000004," And then it was, uh, right."
2682.0400000000004,2683.0800000000004," Well, I mean, that's what I mean."
2683.0800000000004,2684.0800000000004, I don't mean that.
2684.0800000000004,2685.0800000000004, I think.
2685.0800000000004,2686.6800000000003," Like, would you like to shoot a Jew today?"
2686.6800000000003,2687.6800000000003, It wasn't like that.
2687.6800000000003,2689.6800000000003, There was all like variation.
2689.6800000000003,2694.52," It was like, you know, but it was like the silhouette was like clearly an Arabic guy."
2694.52,2696.84," You know, how can you tell the silhouette was it?"
2696.84,2698.2400000000002, Was he wearing like floating?
2698.2400000000002,2699.2400000000002, Yeah.
2699.2400000000002,2700.2400000000002, And they were there.
2700.2400000000002,2703.2400000000002, They're the had in the big beard and a kind of obnoxious hand.
2703.24,2704.24, Yeah.
2704.24,2705.24, Yeah.
2705.24,2706.24, You're going to get in trouble.
2706.24,2711.3999999999996," Someone's going to say, why are you joining the armed forces now?"
2711.3999999999996,2713.3999999999996, And you're going to a combat zone.
2713.3999999999996,2716.52," I'm not saying I'm like, and I hate it that silhouette."
2716.52,2717.52, We're isn't.
2717.52,2718.52, I'm not making it.
2718.52,2719.52, I'm not making it.
2719.52,2722.8799999999997," I'm saying I was, it was startling to me because I'd never been in a gun shop."
2722.8799999999997,2726.2," Actually, that's going to startling to fire any gun when you, when you, when you"
2726.2,2729.3999999999996," was, and shooting the gun, you realize what it's supposed to really, really bring"
2729.3999999999996,2730.3999999999996, experience.
2730.3999999999996,2731.3999999999996, It is.
2731.3999999999996,2732.3999999999996, Yeah.
2732.4,2733.4," It's really, really powerful."
2733.4,2736.12, I hadn't shot any handguns until I went with John.
2736.12,2741.12, And the thing I realized is that if I'm ever like stuck up by someone and I'm like
2741.12,2745.04," more than six feet away, I'm going to fucking run because they're not going to hit me."
2745.04,2746.04, Like they will though.
2746.04,2748.04," Man, this is because you couldn't fire it."
2748.04,2749.04, They've been playing mad dogs.
2749.04,2750.04, They're free.
2750.04,2751.04, They're ready for that shit.
2751.04,2756.28," But I think it takes, I think it takes pretty good practice to be a good shot."
2756.28,2760.96," But most, that's a lot, I think a lot of guns go like Robin and people on the street with"
2760.96,2761.96, guns.
2761.96,2762.96, I'm getting a lot of target practice.
2762.96,2763.96, Right.
2763.96,2764.96," Well, you try running them."
2764.96,2773.0," I just, wait, if you had the gun yourself, you wouldn't shoot, you would run."
2773.0,2777.48," Oh, no, if I was being robbed, I just mean that it's so hard to really like hit someone"
2777.48,2779.36," with a, or walk sideways in my heart."
2779.36,2780.36," Oh, wow."
2780.36,2781.36, I just think I've been going to think.
2781.36,2783.0," Yeah, it's pretty unsteady."
2783.0,2786.56," Like compared to firing a rifle, like, I'm really good shot with a rifle."
2786.56,2787.88, Maybe we should try this out.
2787.88,2789.84, Let's go rob some people.
2789.84,2790.84, See how well we do.
2790.84,2794.7200000000003," That's like, it will do, will do 40% of the gun."
2794.7200000000003,2797.08, 40% will stay.
2797.08,2799.1200000000003, And then we'll have a control group who we just shoot.
2799.1200000000003,2801.1200000000003, We'll just stay.
2801.1200000000003,2804.1200000000003," That's not, that's a false control."
2804.1200000000003,2806.48, We'll get out of the clipboard on that one.
2806.48,2807.48, Yeah.
2807.48,2808.48, Right.
2808.48,2809.48, I'll operate the gun.
2809.48,2813.48, Have you shot an average shot a gun?
2813.48,2815.48, I have not.
2815.48,2816.48, I'm like you.
2816.48,2817.48," Sean, I'm like."
2817.48,2819.84," I shot one, but it was very odd."
2819.84,2820.84, I'm scared.
2820.84,2824.0, But I just did just to know how to shoot it.
2824.0,2827.1600000000003," Just in case, like, I mean, it's a life skill like you don't want to know."
2827.1600000000003,2828.48," I just in case, what does that mean?"
2828.48,2829.7200000000003, If you don't own one.
2829.7200000000003,2831.6800000000003," Well, you can get a gun to fall on the ground."
2831.6800000000003,2834.84," You played those video games to know that in the first level, someone goes,"
2834.84,2835.84," here, take this gun."
2835.84,2836.84, All right.
2836.84,2838.84, You're going to find one on the ground.
2838.84,2839.84, And I'll help you.
2839.84,2843.32, Or you're going to look fine to tell you after a wrench or something.
2843.32,2844.32, All right.
2844.32,2845.32, All right.
2845.32,2847.28, I've upgraded from this wrench.
2848.2400000000002,2852.2400000000002," Now that this guy's chasing me, there's enough out there that, you know,"
2852.2400000000002,2856.52," during World War 4, surely they'll scatter across the road and they all have"
2856.52,2857.6400000000003," a vicious these days, right?"
2857.6400000000003,2858.6400000000003," Actually, yeah."
2858.6400000000003,2859.6400000000003, OK.
2859.6400000000003,2860.6400000000003, Just check any chest.
2860.6400000000003,2861.6400000000003, You're going to find one.
2861.6400000000003,2862.6400000000003, I'm going to be the pack.
2862.6400000000003,2867.36, Just make sure it has an alt fire on it for your second mouse button.
2867.36,2868.36, We don't know.
2868.36,2869.52, We do for a break yet.
2869.52,2870.52, Jury.
2870.52,2871.52, Yes.
2871.52,2872.52, All right.
2872.52,2873.52, We're taking a break.
2873.52,2875.52, The eat a cookie.
2876.48,2877.12," One, two, one."
2877.12,2878.12, You're the best.
2878.12,2880.12, All right.
2880.12,2886.24," Listen to EGM Live, the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly, available every"
2886.24,2888.96, Monday for download at EGM Live.
2888.96,2890.6, One of them come or podcasts.
2890.6,2891.12, That one up.
2891.12,2893.12, Or the iTunes music store.
2893.12,2894.12, We're back.
2894.12,2903.28, I got to say somebody wrote me last week and asked me about these breaks.
2903.28,2905.32," We have, you guys really take a break."
2905.32,2908.7200000000003, Or do you just sit there and then so we can stick a commercial.
2908.7200000000003,2910.7200000000003, And the answer is kind of both.
2910.7200000000003,2911.7200000000003, Sometimes we don't.
2911.7200000000003,2912.5600000000004, There's no break at all.
2912.5600000000004,2915.28, This time there was about two minutes of talking.
2915.28,2917.28, So there's your transparent behind the scenes look.
2917.28,2918.28, Here's what you miss.
2918.28,2919.28, And we all are cooking.
2919.28,2920.28, And we are cooking.
2920.28,2921.6800000000003, This is our commentary track.
2921.6800000000003,2923.28, Behind the grass is a commentary.
2923.28,2924.28, Yeah.
2924.28,2927.0800000000004, I tell Ryan that his response to have you ever fired a gun.
2927.0800000000004,2928.0800000000004, What a band.
2928.0800000000004,2931.8," It should have been to grab his sack and say, I handle the only gun I need."
2931.8,2935.0, And he doesn't shoot like that.
2935.0,2939.7200000000003, Which would actually be funny if Ryan said it with all.
2939.7200000000003,2940.7200000000003, And then I had the gun.
2940.7200000000003,2944.1600000000003, The same grab your sack to Ryan is the host of work environment.
2944.1600000000003,2946.36, Not to do that again.
2946.36,2947.96," Well, that's why it's essential."
2947.96,2949.5600000000004, Kind of things that Ryan says.
2949.5600000000004,2953.44, It seems like he's always only ever talking about touching his penis.
2953.44,2954.44, Like that.
2954.44,2959.88," I mean, that's pretty much all he ever talked about."
2960.52,2963.92," I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, tell me that."
2963.92,2967.44," I mean, that's why you keep it going to quiet."
2967.44,2971.92," Because otherwise, otherwise, we just be talking about that all the time."
2971.92,2972.92, That's true.
2972.92,2973.92," Well, there you go."
2973.92,2974.92, Wow.
2974.92,2976.52, I didn't know you were going that way.
2976.52,2977.52, What?
2977.52,2979.92, He knows the secret from my silence.
2979.92,2982.92, What's inside Ryan's head?
2982.92,2984.92, Jeff is red right now.
2984.92,2987.92," I mean, he's hot in here."
2988.48,2992.04," OK, so I wanted to read last week or two weeks."
2992.04,2993.04, Last week.
2993.04,2999.64, We talked about a new story about some folks who were at a church who
2999.64,3002.96, were bringing kids in the play Halo 3 in church.
3002.96,3005.0, And we talked about different ramifications of that.
3005.0,3006.96, And I don't want to go into all that again.
3006.96,3010.6800000000003, But a guy wrote me a nice letter that I got that I
3010.6800000000003,3012.7200000000003," wanted to just read with his perspective,"
3012.7200000000003,3013.84, got him Dan Davis.
3013.84,3015.16," So thanks, Dan, for writing."
3015.16,3017.88, And he wrote with Halo at church.
3017.88,3022.88," I want you to know, I used to help out in a youth group at a church I attended."
3022.88,3024.84, And we had video game nights.
3024.84,3026.12, There were usually all nighters.
3026.12,3028.76, And we would bring in a bunch of TVs and game consoles and just
3028.76,3031.12, kick back and play games with the kids and their friends.
3031.12,3034.76, We never used this as a bait and switch type ministry.
3034.76,3039.4," We did this because one, we and the kids like video games."
3039.4,3042.2000000000003," And two, it was something for them to do on a Friday night."
3042.2000000000003,3045.12, We didn't even have a message or a talk or anything.
3045.2,3049.3599999999997, It was all done in fun and not used to quote lure people into the church.
3049.3599999999997,3052.56, Kids are smart and they can see past the old bait and switch.
3052.56,3054.24, But we did with far more genuine.
3054.24,3057.72, We showed that you can be a very normal person who was a Christian and
3057.72,3059.12, still played games.
3059.12,3062.48," That is, we showed that we are capable of having fun while just chilling out."
3062.48,3065.2, There were no hidden agendas involved.
3065.2,3069.2799999999997, And so I am sure we did did read some kids because our motives were authentic.
3069.2799999999997,3070.88," Again, kids are stupid."
3070.88,3074.96, And they are not as easily tricked as some of us adults think that they are.
3074.96,3076.56, So I thought I was cool.
3076.56,3078.56, Except kids are stupid.
3078.56,3081.04, And that's fundamental flaw.
3081.04,3084.8, And easily tricked.
3084.8,3087.12, He was trying to trick me in thinking it was cool.
3087.12,3089.12, So I joined his church.
3089.12,3092.4, I want you Dan Davis.
3092.4,3093.4, Thanks.
3093.4,3095.4, I appreciate it.
3095.4,3097.4," Anyway, that's that."
3097.4,3099.4, What else are we got?
3099.4,3100.4, What's your plan?
3100.4,3101.4, What's your plan?
3101.4,3103.4, How about a couple demos just came out?
3103.48,3104.4," Yes, sir."
3104.4,3106.52, How about a big question in this one?
3106.52,3110.08, Who else played UT and COD this weekend?
3110.08,3111.08, Anyone?
3111.08,3112.08, Any one?
3112.08,3112.64, Sean L.E.T.
3112.64,3114.88, Call duty 4 and Unreal Tournament 3.
3114.88,3117.32, Both demos went up.
3117.32,3119.28, Was it just the PC demos I wanted?
3119.28,3120.28, I think so.
3120.28,3121.28, Unincheck the concept.
3121.28,3122.52," Yeah, actually, yes, it was."
3122.52,3123.52, Just PC.
3123.52,3127.2400000000002, I had played a bunch of Call duty 4 on Xbox multiplayer when that came out.
3127.2400000000002,3128.52, But I have not played the PC demo.
3128.52,3130.08," You know, I got a PC demo single player."
3130.08,3133.04, The PC demo single player and they totally should have released the multiplayer demo
3133.04,3134.04, instead.
3134.04,3135.04," Yes, me."
3135.04,3136.04," Well, it was up with it."
3136.04,3139.04," And it's just, it was Sean, we're talking about this earlier today."
3139.04,3142.8," And I kind of, I mean, I got to agree with them on this is that it's kind of the same"
3142.8,3143.8, old tricks.
3143.8,3144.8, A really scripted sequence.
3144.8,3147.2799999999997, It kind of walks you through a really early part of the game.
3147.2799999999997,3151.72," And really, it's not anything that's, it's kind of, it's like a stuff you'd seen in COD"
3151.72,3152.72, and COD 2.
3152.72,3155.44," And it's just, but let's do we forget."
3155.44,3156.92," This was the game that like, wild."
3156.92,3160.96," The game critics at E3 and I think one game of the show, right?"
3160.96,3161.96, It's true.
3161.96,3164.2," And at that point, they were Sean just a single player."
3164.2,3168.96," And if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't,"
3168.96,3175.0," I can't challenge any of that based on this demo, which is a very small sample of gameplay."
3175.0,3179.76," But I played a bit of the multiplayer on the PC, like at a recent Activision event."
3179.76,3183.36, And I think it would have benefited a lot more from Sean off how much the multiplayer
3183.36,3187.28, had changed since the last couple of revisions from the previous games.
3187.28,3190.7200000000003," Well, I was actually not interested in the game until I played the multiplayer on the"
3190.7200000000003,3191.7200000000003, slide.
3191.72,3194.08, And then I was really into that whole leveling up experience.
3194.08,3196.16, I thought that was super fun.
3196.16,3198.3999999999996, But I can't comment on the single player.
3198.3999999999996,3200.0, And then what was up with Unreal Tournament?
3200.0,3201.3999999999996, I think you can talk about it.
3201.3999999999996,3203.4399999999996," Oh, no, go ahead."
3203.4399999999996,3204.4399999999996, Go.
3204.4399999999996,3209.24," I think that, yeah, basically when you play it, part of the thing is that, you know, there's"
3209.24,3212.0," all this to do about, this is a new context."
3212.0,3213.68, This is modern warfare.
3213.68,3218.3599999999997," You're used to the world or two, and we're, you know, change paradigms on this shit."
3218.36,3220.04, So you play it.
3220.04,3225.84," And yeah, it's very much a rescind called duty 2 level."
3225.84,3226.84, This is you hear those.
3226.84,3230.1200000000003, It called duty 2 varied between levels.
3230.1200000000003,3234.6800000000003, The original levels were almost identical to those in the first called duty and it's expansion.
3234.6800000000003,3237.28, And then they started mixing up the formula later on.
3237.28,3242.8, So I'm hoping this is basically another case of that because this level is just a super
3242.8,3248.32," hyperlinear move through, you know, um, an environment that"
3248.32,3253.76," could have, you could change it and say it's North Africa instead of, you know, somewhere."
3253.76,3256.6800000000003, And I'm guessing it's in your radiant peninsula.
3256.6800000000003,3259.6000000000004," And, you know, the guys come out and you shoot them."
3259.6000000000004,3262.6400000000003, There's not really so much AI because the way you fight is like you move forward.
3262.6400000000003,3263.6400000000003, You stop.
3263.6400000000003,3266.96, You shoot them all the guys at pop up and you move forward again.
3266.96,3268.6000000000004," Objectives, I've bitched about it four."
3268.6000000000004,3272.88," So I'll go short on it, but they're, they're very much about going up to an object or"
3272.88,3276.4, an area and pressing a key and a glowing area and pressing a key.
3276.4,3280.2400000000002," So for example, you know, you see the AI gun and you know, you have grenades or something"
3280.2400000000002,3283.7200000000003," or, you know, if you had such holes, you don't throw those over a fence because you actually"
3283.7200000000003,3288.08," go around another way and you see it's there, but you go up and you press a button on it."
3288.08,3289.08, That one wasn't so bad.
3289.08,3293.4," I was, I knew that was going to happen, but then one after that, what the game wants"
3293.4,3296.0, you to do is clear some people out of this house.
3296.0,3301.32, I had the end of the level and it doesn't make sense because it's basically a couple
3301.32,3304.08, machine guns set up behind boards in this house.
3304.16,3308.92," Now the game is already taught you that you can fire through materials based on, you"
3308.92,3313.04," know, and the penetration properties will vary depending on the material and the weapon"
3313.04,3314.04, you're using.
3314.04,3317.88," So they shot, they've taught you to shoot through walls and then there's supply wood blocking"
3317.88,3322.2, an MG nest and suddenly shooting through that does nothing whatsoever.
3322.2,3326.52," And then you have what I stood there for about five minutes, just to test it and this"
3326.52,3328.96, is not how anyone in the right mind is going to play the game.
3328.96,3333.3199999999997," Maybe someone will though and I found, you know, it looked like an infinite spawning where"
3333.4,3338.04, guys continued to come on the balcony with RPGs and you shoot them and then they come back
3338.04,3342.4," again, really what it's trying to do is urge you on to the glowing part on the ground where"
3342.4,3346.6800000000003," you're supposed to press F and that's to have an attack, a helicopter come in, a core"
3346.6800000000003,3348.44, of gunship and blow the building away.
3348.44,3352.2400000000002," Meanwhile, we have a tank that I've been escorting already that's just sitting in the"
3352.2400000000002,3353.2400000000002, back in the field.
3353.2400000000002,3354.6000000000004, I don't know why it doesn't make sense.
3354.6000000000004,3355.88, It was shoot the fucking building.
3355.88,3358.2000000000003, I guess suddenly my bullets don't shoot through plywood anymore.
3358.2000000000003,3359.2000000000003, Maybe you could do it.
3359.2000000000003,3362.92," No, but because you can't go to a circle and press F until it tank the shooting shell."
3362.92,3367.5," And not just you can call maybe get better cell phone reception in the schooling, going"
3367.5,3368.5, circle though.
3368.5,3375.6800000000003," So that stuff, not what's standing the game looks phenomenal, it looks fantastic."
3375.6800000000003,3378.64," But that kind of stuff, it's getting old and it's definitely not new."
3378.64,3382.32, And then the other problem for a kick it back to Darren is that when you die and this is
3382.32,3387.2400000000002, a game we're dying in because you get some hot quotes every time you die.
3387.2400000000002,3391.44," And some of, you know, I know it's very like I got a kernel of wisdom from Candy Rice."
3391.44,3395.52, I just killed myself and it drops up like a candy rice quote and she's telling me about
3395.52,3398.08," how, you know, wars changed and it's a whole new war."
3398.08,3400.68," And I'm like, bitch, you're full of shit."
3400.68,3403.68," Oh, I can't even say it."
3403.68,3406.44, I'm going to do more.
3406.44,3410.28, I'm going to be wrong and the real world.
3410.28,3412.28, I'm going to be a real world.
3412.28,3414.28, I'm going to be a real world.
3414.28,3416.28, That's a track record.
3416.28,3419.48," Yeah, I'm just going to add on two quick things to what you were just saying."
3419.48,3420.48, Totally agree with everything.
3420.56,3424.2," I actually missed that glowing part to call the attack choppers because I kept like,"
3424.2,3426.12," you know, because I was so used to the linear format."
3426.12,3429.84," I was like looking forward to a way to get into this, this house because through earlier"
3429.84,3431.92," in the screen, you didn't know the dude screaming at you."
3431.92,3433.32, Over to the fashion light.
3433.32,3434.72, Press the goddamn button.
3434.72,3435.72, I can't imagine.
3435.72,3437.36, He's screaming at you.
3437.36,3441.76, He's screaming at you to call in the eye.
3441.76,3443.32," You know, it's calling for the eye art for the choppers."
3443.32,3446.36," But I'm like, I was so far ahead by the time that point came up."
3446.36,3450.2400000000002," So I'm like, okay, I figured maybe I could like one up beside the house or drop a marker."
3450.24,3451.24, Somewhere.
3451.24,3452.6, You got to make a better excuse for that.
3452.6,3456.3199999999997," Tell me you're contemplating the wisdom of like, uh, county, county, rice or no."
3456.3199999999997,3457.3199999999997, I was up.
3457.3199999999997,3458.3199999999997, I was up at the building.
3458.3199999999997,3460.6," I was already like like a pretty depressed, the chargine and kind of take them"
3460.6,3461.6, off from the inside.
3461.6,3463.16, I wasn't looking behind the building.
3463.16,3464.64, It's blocked up by a fence.
3464.64,3467.7599999999998," And if you look around to the left side, there's an arbitrary pile of rubble that you can"
3467.7599999999998,3469.7999999999997, climb through like on every other part of that level.
3469.7999999999997,3471.6, But suddenly you can't go over it there.
3471.6,3472.6, Yeah.
3472.6,3473.6, I hate that kind of stuff.
3473.6,3474.6, That's total worship.
3474.6,3478.24, That's the one that you guys are just going to play in that the roller coaster has tracks.
3478.24,3479.24, Exactly.
3479.24,3480.08, That's the kind of thing.
3480.08,3486.84, I have to say it was fun and so much of it on the strength of the presentation on the
3486.84,3488.72, scripting for a single playthrough.
3488.72,3491.6," You know, on the first playthrough, fantastic scripting."
3491.6,3496.04," And it's just that it's now becoming, you know, the shooter space like all the spaces"
3496.04,3499.68," in video game genres, like they just evolved so rapidly."
3499.68,3505.92, And it's so easy to go from being state of the art one year to seeming like the band
3505.92,3509.52," that keeps re-recording the same album after a year, after a year."
3509.52,3511.56," And again, this is just the smallest demo."
3511.56,3512.56, Right.
3512.56,3517.2, Don't even consider changing your buying decision based on whatever shit I'm talking
3517.2,3518.2, about.
3518.2,3519.2, Right.
3519.2,3522.48," I mean, there's a long, long history of demos, not being where it's ended up."
3522.48,3524.52," And in fact, doing it to service to the game."
3524.52,3528.64," And it's like, yeah, it's likely just this out of context, slice of Ryan Holdings."
3528.64,3533.64, Maybe you could have taken a slice of any awesome game and it could look shit.
3533.64,3534.64, Right.
3534.64,3539.4," You could find a super tedious moment in episode two, which it does have some."
3539.4,3542.92, And you would think that can totally pick a big part of the decision making process.
3542.92,3545.48, And selecting a demo is picking something that's really easy.
3545.48,3546.48, Yeah.
3546.48,3550.12, It's probably serves the equivalent of the tutorial level now because now it's a little
3550.12,3553.32, bit old to start you and that got the firing range and then making run.
3553.32,3554.64, I'll teach you to crawl.
3554.64,3555.64, Teach you to jump.
3555.64,3557.64," Congratulations, soldier."
3557.64,3558.64, You know what?
3558.64,3559.64, It duck now.
3559.64,3560.64, Yeah.
3560.64,3562.64," So I think it's, I'm thinking that it's got to be that."
3562.64,3563.64, Right.
3563.64,3565.6800000000003, And the big thing they've been talking about for this game is that how like the later levels
3565.68,3570.12," are so open ended and like, or at least have like these choke, like more choke points that"
3570.12,3571.12, kind of lead on different areas.
3571.12,3572.12, I'm looking forward to that.
3572.12,3575.52," And I definitely, I mean, I suck some of that here, but not much."
3575.52,3579.9199999999996, I thought that was a good point that Robert made about the roller coaster tracks.
3579.9199999999996,3584.3599999999997," I mean, because really, like, I mean, we've talked about this before, but I was thinking"
3584.3599999999997,3587.12," about half life episode two, which I'm about halfway through now."
3587.12,3588.44, And I'm liking it a lot.
3588.44,3594.16," But like really, you know, how is it different than what you're talking about really?"
3594.16,3598.08," We're not, I mean, we're complaining that not so much that the roller coaster has tracks,"
3598.08,3603.2," but we're complaining that say it's like 2007, and if like this one theme park, all it does"
3603.2,3605.2, is keep rebuilding the same wooden coaster.
3605.2,3609.24, Everyone else has got like that fucked up half pipe one I told you about from dead
3609.24,3610.24, collar at home.
3610.24,3611.24, Right.
3611.24,3612.24, Give me that shit in.
3612.24,3613.24, Right.
3613.24,3616.04," Also, I mean, really half life doesn't, they don't have the like, golden button."
3616.04,3617.68," Like, they're still puzzled to figure out."
3617.68,3618.68, Right.
3618.68,3620.92," They don't just say, walk up to the singing, click this thing."
3620.92,3621.92, Right.
3621.92,3623.68," Well, I guess my only beef, throughout the whole thing."
3623.68,3624.68, I enjoyed it.
3624.68,3628.44," I mean, a grave is a short demo, and I know it's a very small slice, but like, show us"
3628.44,3631.8399999999997," pointing out that you use a very, they use one set of logic throughout the entire area."
3631.8399999999997,3634.64," And then you get to the end and you're like, you're trying to apply that same logic."
3634.64,3637.0," And you have to like, you're back and look for the glowing circle on the ground."
3637.0,3638.0, Yeah.
3638.0,3639.0, Right.
3639.0,3642.72," Half life does a great job of, of least making you have to think."
3642.72,3647.0," In fact, when I was playing last night, I was thinking, this is much more, especially after"
3647.0,3650.64," just having played the Hail of Three campaign, it's much more a puzzle game, really, then"
3650.64,3651.64, a shooter at this point.
3651.64,3652.64, Yeah.
3652.64,3656.52, That's what you might be reading a lot of message boards and you're not back and down.
3656.52,3657.52," No, no, I'm not."
3657.52,3658.52, The other.
3658.52,3659.52, Okay.
3659.52,3660.52," No, no, no."
3660.52,3661.52, This was all me.
3661.52,3662.52, All right.
3662.52,3663.52," Me and my opinion, sir."
3663.52,3664.52, What is this?
3664.52,3665.52, I don't know.
3665.52,3666.52," I just say, holy, man."
3666.52,3667.52, I'm not guessing it.
3667.52,3668.52, I'm not saying it.
3668.52,3669.52, That's a bad thing.
3669.52,3675.44," But people go, I mean, what happens is like, there will be like sub-pockets of consensus, you"
3675.44,3679.3199999999997," know, where someone says, well, the shooting shit in the game, the guns aren't powerful."
3679.3199999999997,3680.3199999999997, I'm not saying it.
3680.32,3681.32, It's a big deal.
3681.32,3683.4," And then there will be others that say, this, that another thing."
3683.4,3687.04," And the same way that, you know, I take positions on Hail of This Net and what happens"
3687.04,3689.04," I, I was joking."
3689.04,3690.04," No, that's fine."
3690.04,3693.88," But I think a lot of people, when they get used to seeing this so long, they sort of"
3693.88,3696.28, let message board consent form better.
3696.28,3698.56," But I'm not, because I'm not making a judgment call."
3698.56,3701.6800000000003," In fact, I actually like the shooting and the weapons in Half-Life."
3701.6800000000003,3707.48," I've just struck me after playing a game that was so very combat heavy, which is Halo,"
3707.48,3712.04," that there's long stretches in Half-Life episode two, where you're actually not shooting"
3712.04,3713.04, anything.
3713.04,3714.04, And that's compiling.
3714.04,3715.04, I think you're fine.
3715.04,3716.04, I like that a lot.
3716.04,3719.04, That was exactly what I was sort of trying to celebrate in my review.
3719.04,3720.04, Right.
3720.04,3723.88, It was just the pacing because they have so many options and they're able to mix them
3723.88,3726.32, up by the 20 minute intervals.
3726.32,3730.16," But I just got past the, just a little bit past, no, I'm further than that."
3730.16,3732.36," But last night, I did the bridge thing."
3732.36,3734.36, I don't want to have any spoilers.
3734.36,3735.36, Right.
3735.36,3736.36, I'm not going to do it.
3736.52,3738.04, You have to get across a bridge.
3738.04,3739.04, That puzzle.
3739.04,3740.88," No, that was so fun."
3740.88,3742.84, And it has nothing to do with shooting anything.
3742.84,3746.0, And every hint is communicated solely through the environment.
3746.0,3747.0, Absolutely.
3747.0,3749.0," And that takes, like that takes two things."
3749.0,3753.92, It takes a faith in your audience as intelligence and ability to solve problems.
3753.92,3758.84, But an even greater faith in your ability to create challenges and to suggest solutions
3758.84,3761.92, through the puzzles themselves.
3761.92,3764.6800000000003," You know, there's the classic one of a grenade jump."
3764.68,3765.8399999999997, Let's just say that.
3765.8399999999997,3770.08, And I mentioned in my review a few instances of puzzles were no other developer
3770.08,3776.44, and to my awareness would even attempt these puzzles in the absence of some other
3776.44,3781.96," character or text or something that you could go back to that explicitly said,"
3781.96,3784.24," hey, why don't you try this, dip shit?"
3784.24,3789.2799999999997," You know, I mean, where they entirely everything, see, I can I spoil it and just talk"
3789.2799999999997,3790.2799999999997, about this one room.
3790.2799999999997,3791.2799999999997, Okay.
3791.2799999999997,3792.2799999999997, Which room?
3792.2799999999997,3793.2799999999997, I'll just tell you forever.
3793.36,3795.0400000000004, Where you use a grenade to jump somewhere.
3795.0400000000004,3798.36," But so what happens is, I don't think I'm there yet."
3798.36,3801.6400000000003," Then this, you guys got to finish this game."
3801.6400000000003,3806.0400000000004, We're not going to play the episode one yet.
3806.0400000000004,3807.2000000000003, So I had to play that.
3807.2000000000003,3808.2000000000003, Okay.
3808.2000000000003,3809.6000000000004," Well, anyway, yeah, go back."
3809.6000000000004,3813.84," And but when you do get to a part in your user grenade to jump, and it's not look"
3813.84,3818.4, around and see what they did to communicate to you that that would be a possibility.
3818.4,3823.64," Because like I said, you know, for a mainstream game to even have that mechanic,"
3823.64,3825.2000000000003," yeah, user grenade to jump somewhere."
3825.2000000000003,3826.2000000000003, Right.
3826.2000000000003,3830.7200000000003," I mean, again, that would be, and in this particular instance, that's not a behavior"
3830.7200000000003,3835.12," that they've been teaching you in the way that like, oh, we've been teaching players"
3835.12,3839.2400000000002, that they can move latches or crates with the gravity gun in a neutral environment where
3839.2400000000002,3840.96, they just fuck with stuff.
3840.96,3842.92, And then we have them do it again and ramp it up.
3842.92,3844.2400000000002," It's like, this is it."
3844.2400000000002,3847.52," This is the one time you won't, and only time you've ever had to do this."
3848.4,3852.52, But we're going to find a way to communicate this to you through the environment.
3852.52,3853.52, Right.
3853.52,3855.1600000000003," It was just like, I just really appreciate that."
3855.1600000000003,3858.88," I don't think that's like necessary to have a good game, not at all."
3858.88,3860.6, But I think I love it when it's there.
3860.6,3861.88, I love to see that happen.
3861.88,3867.32," I think there are a lot of leaps like that in portal where you know the basic rules, but"
3867.32,3871.28," when you finally discover how to get past a certain point, it's really like a one time"
3871.28,3872.28, thing.
3872.28,3873.28," Like, oh shit."
3873.28,3876.88," It's a difference between, you know, you see, you see the movie, this came up in our,"
3876.88,3880.44," you know, like the, the, here's a war car story about where you see some movies."
3880.44,3882.32, They bring in a character later on.
3882.32,3886.04," And they got to remind you that, oh, this is someone you saw before."
3886.04,3887.92, And so they just have all these heavy handed things.
3887.92,3892.04," They'll throw a flashback in and they have the, some person's got a big scar in the"
3892.04,3893.2000000000003, same spot or something like that.
3893.2000000000003,3897.36, And then there's those movies that when they all just sort of seamlessly come together.
3897.36,3900.88," And you feel smarter for watching them because you're like, hey, I wonder if the next guy"
3900.88,3901.88, figured that out.
3901.88,3902.88, Probably did.
3902.88,3903.88, And that's the great thing about it.
3903.88,3908.2000000000003," And it's done so well that the audience feels, you know, rewarded for it."
3908.2000000000003,3909.48," Yeah, portals brilliant at that."
3909.48,3914.1600000000003," I mean, that's why when you get up to like 18 and 19, and then you're just kind of intuitively"
3914.1600000000003,3916.52," doing these, these tricks, crazy."
3916.52,3918.56, That you had to totally figure out on your own.
3918.56,3920.8," If you were to explain, you never would have thought of."
3920.8,3922.2400000000002," And I mean, it really trains you."
3922.2400000000002,3925.7200000000003," And if you had to explain that, like say that, but someone called you over, hey, come"
3925.7200000000003,3927.48," over here, Jeff, can you just tell me how to do this?"
3927.48,3928.48, Right.
3928.48,3931.92," You would only build a do it by like pointing and like, let me just show you."
3931.92,3932.92, Yeah.
3932.92,3936.52," It's right because you're thinking, yeah, you're, you're solving a problem in such a way that"
3936.52,3939.2400000000002, you're a problem that you're not used to solving.
3939.2400000000002,3943.32," Yeah, but I think to a couple of you guys at lunch, like this is the first game in a"
3943.32,3947.92," while portal where I, I, I, I share an office with my wife and she's often doing like"
3947.92,3951.56, actual important things while I'm goofing off with games in the same room.
3951.56,3953.56," But I had, I had portal up on the screen."
3953.56,3956.6800000000003," And I was like talking out loud to myself, like trying to figure out, I'd be like,"
3956.6800000000003,3959.8," looking at through him, like, going, like, okay, I got to move the thing over there."
3959.8,3960.8, And then cheat the thing here.
3961.36,3962.1600000000003," Oh, yeah."
3962.1600000000003,3963.5600000000004, Is that what you're working on?
3963.5600000000004,3965.5600000000004," Oh, I came."
3965.5600000000004,3968.36," But really, you're not to learn the rings."
3968.36,3974.4," Now the circle is completely, but I love that."
3974.4,3976.96, And then coming up with the solution is so satisfying.
3976.96,3980.1600000000003, And I feel that way even an episode too and what's so cool about about the Half-Life
3980.1600000000003,3985.32," Universe to me has always been like, it's, they feel very, like, real world solutions."
3985.32,3989.92," Like, you really can go, like, okay, they're telling me I have to get out of there, out of"
3989.92,3992.4, that window in this room and it seems impossible.
3992.4,3994.92," Well, let me look around the room and see what I have to work with."
3994.92,3995.92, Yeah.
3995.92,3997.56," And they answer, there's always something logical."
3997.56,4000.32," You know, it never is something where you would go, huh?"
4000.32,4003.08, Where you'd have to look on game facts to figure it out.
4003.08,4004.08, Because it's some bullshit.
4004.08,4006.56," And there are multiple ways, you know, by the way, yeah."
4006.56,4012.16," I think the valve is really like, on to some sort of amazing sort of game design"
4012.16,4013.16, minimalism.
4013.16,4018.04," I mean, portal being like the ultimate example of that, you know, give you one gun,"
4018.12,4021.52, set you in a laboratory where everything's like just super clean.
4021.52,4026.16," Triple A, minimalism is a difference because that minimalism has been sort of cultivated"
4026.16,4028.96," in the, you know, the casual gaming space and the download space."
4029.68,4030.2, Yeah.
4030.56,4032.84, But they use it for such an amazing impact.
4032.84,4037.8," Like the first time you ever come upon a little room with the messages and stuff,"
4037.8,4040.92," after you made that little brat in the environment, you're like, whoa, holy shit."
4040.92,4043.04," It's like a huge, you know."
4043.2799999999997,4049.7599999999998," And the, the, the less they try to like impress you with giant bang explosion crazy"
4049.7599999999998,4052.92," shit, the more it's impressive when something happens."
4052.92,4053.12, Yeah.
4053.12,4056.32," It's like when you see, it's like the quiet, it's a quiet discovery."
4056.32,4060.16," Like, say if you're in your own house and you something that should be in one place"
4060.16,4062.2799999999997, is moved and you're trying to account for it.
4062.56,4062.7599999999998, Yeah.
4062.7599999999998,4067.56," You know, or if you're like looking through, you know, like if you're in a Ryan's room"
4067.56,4072.68," looking through his lingerie, you're like, oh, no."
4072.68,4074.08," Oh, God, I'm sorry."
4074.08,4074.6, I'm fired.
4074.6,4080.24," He's going to say Jeff, and I turned to Ryan."
4080.24,4082.24, I wanted to bring you into the conversation.
4082.24,4083.8799999999997, Definitely against you.
4083.8799999999997,4084.8799999999997, Kind of guess.
4084.8799999999997,4085.8799999999997," Oh, great."
4085.8799999999997,4091.6," Someone was like, leather like a really not, not rubber, not trashy, like, not a class leather."
4091.6,4092.6, Some ass.
4092.6,4094.9199999999996," You like, so you think of Ryan's digging the whole thing."
4094.9199999999996,4095.9199999999996, That's your problem.
4095.9199999999996,4101.0," Someone who listens to our podcast was telling me that, you guys are mean to Ryan."
4101.0,4102.0," And I'm like, no, we're not."
4102.0,4104.0," And I'm like, it's mean to Ryan."
4104.0,4105.0," Okay, I'll try."
4105.0,4106.0, I'm not going to tell you.
4106.0,4107.0, I'm not going to tell you.
4107.0,4108.0, I'm not going to tell you.
4108.0,4109.0, I'm not going to tell you.
4109.0,4110.0, Let's go back to your original.
4110.0,4111.0," I love you, Ryan."
4111.0,4114.0, An example of how men try to socialize though.
4114.0,4116.0," It's like, Ryan's not talking."
4116.0,4117.0, I'm going to be talking.
4117.0,4118.0, Be a dick.
4118.0,4121.0, I'm not talking to the arm.
4121.0,4122.0, It's not your kind of woman.
4122.0,4123.0, What do you got to say about that?
4123.0,4124.0, Where are you so quiet?
4124.0,4125.0, Just like high school.
4125.0,4132.0, You're being generous.
4132.0,4133.0, Okay.
4133.0,4135.0, I apologize to Ryan.
4135.0,4139.0," Dude, I still love Mama jokes, man."
4139.0,4141.0, I asked those who play online with that.
4141.0,4144.0, I get some good Mama jokes.
4144.0,4147.0," Well, that's like every if there's so many options."
4147.0,4150.0," Once you once you get used to, once you tell yourself, okay,"
4150.0,4153.0," if your opportunity arises, then Mama joke."
4153.0,4155.0, Then they always come.
4155.0,4157.0," Like you're playing, you know, company heroes."
4157.0,4159.0," It's like, come on, we got to push harder."
4159.0,4162.0," But I told you, come on, it's just push like your mom on the toilet."
4162.0,4165.0," And like, it's like, it's the dumbest thing."
4165.0,4169.0," But it's kind of, it's kind of, or you'll see, like,"
4169.0,4173.0," do you look at this operation, man train, because there's like someone's basically"
4173.0,4175.0, turning their soldiers into their things.
4175.0,4176.0, There's like a dust of them.
4176.0,4178.0, Like do they're all in the way to your mom's house?
4178.0,4180.0," I mean, there's dumb."
4180.0,4182.0, I think I did a turn.
4182.0,4188.0, That one's just going to do a show about Sean and his various online friends playing games
4188.0,4190.0, because it would be the modern Beavison but head.
4190.0,4193.0, I play games with Sean and I've got him on teams.
4193.0,4195.0, Speak and he's saying how he's pretty shit.
4195.0,4197.0," I'm like, what is going on?"
4197.0,4198.0, Yeah.
4198.0,4200.0, The story of wangling?
4200.0,4202.0, That's what can blow your mind.
4202.0,4205.0, Don't even try to fucking explain this.
4205.0,4206.0, I'm going to do it.
4206.0,4207.0," No, no."
4207.0,4208.0, I'm going to eat what you're trying to do.
4208.0,4209.0, We have to turn the tape off.
4209.0,4210.0," No, no, no, no, no, no."
4210.0,4211.0, The story of wangling.
4211.0,4212.0, It's unknowable.
4212.0,4217.0, He and Rory were trying to explain to me this elaborate inside joke.
4217.0,4219.0, It took like 15 minutes.
4219.0,4220.0, Was it funny at the end?
4220.0,4223.0," No, I would just say, we don't have that kind of time."
4223.0,4225.0, What the fuck are you guys talking about?
4225.0,4229.0," I can give you the five second, Cliffs No, it's version of the legacy of wangling."
4229.0,4230.0, Okay.
4230.0,4231.0, Okay.
4231.0,4233.0," So wangling first of all is, uh, not well, not five seconds."
4233.0,4235.0, Let's start the clock.
4235.0,4236.0, Here we go.
4236.0,4238.0," Wangling is a tiny, tiny Filipino."
4239.0,4240.0," Fortunately, the Martial Artist."
4240.0,4242.0," Yeah, Martial Artist and performer."
4242.0,4245.0, He started in spy movies.
4245.0,4246.0," Oh, that's dope."
4246.0,4247.0, Okay.
4247.0,4250.0," And you can go, you can YouTube search a wangling."
4250.0,4251.0, Find out stuff about them.
4251.0,4252.0, There's wraps about them.
4252.0,4253.0, So we're watching it.
4253.0,4261.0," And we're like hypothesizing on his biological origins, his dietary habits, his, you know, reproductive"
4261.0,4263.0," process, all these other things."
4263.0,4266.0," And we're, so what we figured out was that he,"
4267.0,4271.0," Okay. Oh my god dude, I can't believe how he translate this shit."
4271.0,4276.0," Oh, so wangling, like, he, he doesn't hit, so reproductive organs."
4276.0,4278.0, He has a cloaca. He's very bird like.
4278.0,4283.0, And he accidentally became impregnated by sitting on a public toilet one time.
4283.0,4285.0, Where is this going?
4285.0,4286.0, No way.
4286.0,4290.0, It's going to make you wish that you were on drugs.
4290.0,4291.0, Is that it?
4291.0,4293.0, So he's a symbiotic organism.
4294.0,4298.0," He, he, he feeds on a diet consisting of Brazil,"
4298.0,4299.0, Mungango and D's nuts.
4299.0,4304.0," So he, what's he, he clings there, but in, for his host organism,"
4304.0,4309.0, what is the benefit he provides is an enhanced ability to digest corn.
4309.0,4310.0, And he's a quarter.
4310.0,4311.0, Yeah.
4311.0,4313.0, He's looking non.
4313.0,4315.0," They really, yeah."
4315.0,4316.0, We had to.
4316.0,4320.0," But we had so, okay, I'll just cut it there, but if you're ever interested, right me?"
4320.0,4324.0," I can tell you, like, how the story of, you know, how wangling was born,"
4324.0,4329.0," the origins of a morphology, sexual dimorphism in the wangling species."
4329.0,4332.0," Okay, so it's just that it evolved over teams being counted this."
4332.0,4334.0, I think you have an idea of it.
4334.0,4337.0," It's just, obviously something that was a product of a long night of him"
4337.0,4338.0, gaming with roaring.
4338.0,4342.0, And he tried to explain the entire joke to me in five minutes.
4342.0,4344.0," And it just, it was like a different language."
4344.0,4345.0," Oh, yeah."
4345.0,4346.0," It just gives you a bad, but we're on there."
4346.0,4348.0, We just babble as we're playing.
4348.0,4351.0, I do have to say that I did play some team for it to stay with you.
4351.0,4353.0, I don't know what night that was in the last few nights.
4353.0,4356.0, And I was laughing my head off.
4356.0,4360.0," I had to move the microwave from my head because he was, you were playing his,"
4360.0,4362.0," his playing his Ralphie, basically."
4362.0,4365.0," And he just, he sucks these guys in so bad."
4365.0,4368.0, You have this innate ability to get people totally mad at you.
4368.0,4371.0," And I want to boot you from the server and if they did, you got booted."
4371.0,4374.0," I was like, oh, I can't play my shit anymore."
4374.0,4375.0, I just like record some of it.
4375.0,4379.0," Like since I got the banana writers, we'll just, I can count on everyone to follow me to the next server."
4379.0,4382.0," It's like, it's like, it's a perfect snitch."
4382.0,4385.0, You have a roving team speak audience.
4385.0,4387.0," That's the very, it's very handy."
4387.0,4391.0," Kaufman asked for a good one and then someone comes in and they like,"
4391.0,4393.0," fuck it all up because they're like, I want to be on this joke."
4393.0,4395.0," I want to be on this, you know, you know, this, you know,"
4395.0,4396.0," this, right."
4396.0,4397.0, That's why I was moving to microwave.
4397.0,4400.0," You can't laugh because then you're, yeah, it's, it's like,"
4400.0,4402.0, then the guy realizes he's the punchline.
4402.0,4403.0, Yeah.
4403.0,4404.0, You want him to actually keep getting mad.
4404.0,4407.0," That one, there were two perfect instances that night."
4407.0,4411.0," The one, the guy was just like immediately, I rate and he was like yelling that,"
4411.0,4413.0," you know, they need to send you to Iraq."
4413.0,4415.0," You need to see Iraq and stuff and I was like, so then I was like,"
4415.0,4416.0," all right, let's run with it."
4416.0,4420.0," So let's, he, another thing, they were accusing me of being insanely drunk."
4420.0,4425.0," So I told him that I'd fought, I didn't participate in the Panamanian invasion"
4425.0,4427.0, that I was too old.
4427.0,4428.0, Are they also said he went down?
4428.0,4429.0," So to go to, right."
4429.0,4430.0, Yeah.
4430.0,4433.0," And then I did, yeah, I told him that I was drinking anti-free."
4433.0,4435.0, And all this other shit.
4435.0,4437.0," And they were, believe in that, that they're crazy."
4437.0,4438.0, Yeah.
4438.0,4442.0," And then it's just, you just played up and then the perfect combination then is when there's a girl in the server."
4442.0,4447.0," Because you immediately start, because whenever there's a girl in any shooter,"
4447.0,4450.0, she's got like an autourage of white nights.
4450.0,4453.0," And as soon as you say something to her, they're all like,"
4453.0,4454.0," yeah, who's this fucking retard?"
4454.0,4457.0," And now it's like, oh, yeah, go ahead and call me that."
4457.0,4459.0, My own grandma calls me retire.
4459.0,4461.0, You think it's gonna hurt my feelings anymore.
4461.0,4464.0," I get call that every day, whatever."
4464.0,4467.0," And so eventually he start building it simultaneously,"
4467.0,4471.0, pissing off the guys and building sympathy with the girl.
4471.0,4473.0, So it's perfect.
4473.0,4476.0, You're creating this like awesome device of wedge.
4476.0,4478.0, And then they just keep going off.
4478.0,4481.0," And then suddenly the girls like, come on, guys, that's just stop."
4481.0,4482.0, Leave him alone.
4482.0,4483.0, Just leave him alone.
4483.0,4485.0, And then you just build it on that.
4485.0,4486.0, And it just goes from there.
4486.0,4488.0, Like her name was Princess Zelda.
4488.0,4490.0, You sound like a real princess to me.
4490.0,4493.0, And then the guys make fun of that.
4493.0,4494.0, Shut the fuck up.
4494.0,4495.0," And then she's sweet, guys."
4495.0,4496.0, Shut up.
4496.0,4498.0," You know, sometimes it just..."
4498.0,4500.0, That is the most manipulative thing.
4500.0,4502.0," You know, awesome thing."
4502.0,4505.0," I mean, that's a great tactic with my,"
4505.0,4508.0," you know, when Sean first started working at,"
4508.0,4510.0," well, he'd been at each and for a long time."
4510.0,4511.0, And then you laughed.
4511.0,4513.0, Then you were freelance and then you came back.
4513.0,4514.0, And he worked for us.
4514.0,4517.0," But early on, when when bully came out, was that,"
4517.0,4519.0, were you already at our magazine or were you?
4519.0,4520.0," Yeah, that was reasonable."
4520.0,4521.0, Okay.
4521.0,4522.0, So that was okay.
4522.0,4526.0, But I didn't have like total clear insight into your personality until
4526.0,4527.0, bully came out.
4527.0,4530.0," Because when bully came out, or right when it was before,"
4530.0,4532.0," whatever, somebody at 1-up.com center and email saying,"
4532.0,4536.0," Hey, we're looking for a good feature to do online with the"
4536.0,4537.0, Reciably.
4537.0,4540.0," So if you have any good stories about like,"
4540.0,4543.0," when you were bullied, when you were little, or if you were a bully,"
4543.0,4545.0, to send them and we'll work with that.
4545.0,4548.0, And so people wrote things I wrote about like getting picked on or
4548.0,4549.0, whatever.
4549.0,4551.0," They were like a bunch of like, here's how I was bullied."
4551.0,4554.0," Yeah, I put it all over the tree."
4554.0,4555.0, Sean is right.
4555.0,4556.0, Right.
4556.0,4557.0," But Sean, right."
4557.0,4562.0," So like 5,000 word manifesto of like all the ways he bullied"
4562.0,4563.0, people growing up.
4563.0,4565.0, That was fucking harsh.
4565.0,4566.0, Shit.
4566.0,4567.0, He was a bully.
4567.0,4569.0, That was dude with me.
4569.0,4571.0, It was funny.
4571.0,4572.0, It was funny.
4572.0,4573.0, It was funny.
4573.0,4574.0, It was funny.
4574.0,4575.0, It's like all tragedies in life.
4575.0,4576.0, You learn it.
4576.0,4578.0," So when does it to you and then you just perpetuate the,"
4578.0,4581.0," So the kids, two grades older called the circle of life."
4581.0,4583.0," And yeah, they just teach you."
4583.0,4584.0, They punch you.
4584.0,4585.0, You punch.
4585.0,4586.0, It's like right.
4586.0,4589.0, Just wanted about strangle thorn fail in world or craft.
4589.0,4590.0, Isn't that right?
4590.0,4592.0, I learned about it a while ago.
4592.0,4593.0," Put in words and rhymes, man."
4593.0,4595.0, We talking and I talked about this earlier.
4595.0,4596.0, The certain more life.
4596.0,4597.0, What did he tell me?
4597.0,4599.0, I cleared out my strangle thorn quest.
4599.0,4602.0, A strangle thorn veil for those of you who don't know is on the
4602.0,4605.0," World of Warcraft, PVP series is very notorious."
4605.0,4606.0, Game game.
4606.0,4609.0, Did it you told me when wing sounded ridiculous?
4609.0,4610.0, This is at least gaming.
4610.0,4611.0, That only took like five seconds.
4611.0,4613.0, This was on topic.
4613.0,4615.0, I still don't know what it's about.
4615.0,4616.0, But let's talk.
4616.0,4617.0, Good.
4617.0,4618.0, And so.
4618.0,4625.0, I finally last night cleared out all the quests I had in that area.
4625.0,4631.0, And I plan on coming back when I'm level 70 to kill some people.
4631.0,4632.0, Kill people.
4632.0,4633.0, I got you.
4633.0,4636.0, That's the circle of life at Strangathon.

4638.0,4642.0, And guys who are way higher than you who have no business being in that zone will
4642.0,4643.0, come around to gain you.
4643.0,4645.0, And you spend your whole time being gain going.
4645.0,4648.0," Man, when I get fucking high enough, I'm coming back here and I'm going to"
4648.0,4649.0, gain everybody.
4649.0,4650.0, That's the Strangathon.
4650.0,4652.0, That's a thing of a sort of life.
4652.0,4653.0, It's a very nice thing.
4653.0,4654.0, Wow.
4654.0,4657.0, Some psychology studies in games.
4657.0,4658.0, We need them.
4658.0,4659.0, Mm-hmm.
4659.0,4661.0, A little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a behavior.
4661.0,4662.0, So what did you learn about?
4662.0,4667.0, What did you learn about Xbox Live Player psychology plays in quarters two?
4667.0,4674.0, Let me just say that I played the PC version for a couple of weeks and my PC is kind of
4674.0,4675.0, ass.
4675.0,4679.0," And so when the Xbox version came out, I bought it."
4679.0,4681.0, And I played it first day.
4681.0,4686.0," And I was excited to play it with the nice, full graphics."
4686.0,4687.0, Mm-hmm.
4687.0,4693.0, But the very first game I got into was just a cluster fuck of Rednex.
4693.0,4695.0, It was insane.
4695.0,4697.0," No, it sounds so cliche."
4697.0,4701.0," But there was a guy who was literally was like, I don't understand."
4701.0,4703.0, I've been playing this game all day.
4703.0,4705.0, What am I supposed to be doing?
4705.0,4708.0," And I said, well, you should get to his plaintiff's."
4708.0,4710.0, He's playing as a spy.
4710.0,4716.0," He's playing as a spy and I was like, well, you should play a medic or, you know, a soldier or something"
4716.0,4718.0, easy and just get the hang of it.
4718.0,4723.0," He goes, I don't care who I am, but what am I supposed to be doing?"
4723.0,4728.0, Because we're on like the grainery or whatever.
4728.0,4730.0, I forget what the name of that level is.
4730.0,4735.0, And he didn't get that you were supposed to be standing on the capture points or defending your own
4735.0,4736.0, capture points.
4736.0,4738.0, And he said he'd been playing all day.
4738.0,4740.0," But anyway, I just kept on having to be experienced."
4740.0,4742.0, Did he not watch the movie when you love it?
4742.0,4743.0," Yeah, I did."
4743.0,4745.0, You don't think that he just hit star.
4745.0,4747.0, I can't wait to make it.
4747.0,4748.0, I'm not sure.
4748.0,4750.0, Come on now.
4750.0,4752.0, Did me read the help notes?
4752.0,4755.0," But I mean, I've had better experiences lately."
4755.0,4757.0, I think people are getting the hang of it.
4757.0,4762.0," But I've definitely, it's like I've had a few really good games where there are people who are really playing the game."
4762.0,4766.0, And then a lot of really bad games were the entire team decides to be a spy.
4766.0,4767.0, Yeah.
4767.0,4769.0, Why the entire team wants to be a spy?
4769.0,4772.0, But that happens like half the fucking time.
4772.0,4775.0, But I play that game on Xbox.
4775.0,4776.0, Yeah.
4776.0,4779.0," I've been hearing a lot of reports that like, you're at least some guys around here."
4779.0,4787.0," It's on the console over the weekend and it kept like, once you had more than say six people playing, it turned it like a frame rate slideshow."
4787.0,4788.0, On Xbox.
4788.0,4789.0, Yeah.
4789.0,4795.0," I've had that happen a couple of times, but not I've definitely played big games that worked well."
4795.0,4799.0, But it's definitely not not the optimal way to play it.
4799.0,4802.0, But I wouldn't say that it's not optimal because of the controller.
4802.0,4805.0, I actually am pretty good with the controller.
4805.0,4806.0," I'm not, it's not the last."
4806.0,4811.0, I actually can play anything on the Xbox version because it's not very hard.
4811.0,4813.0, I can play a spy and get away with it.
4813.0,4817.0," Whereas in other like if I play in PC, I get found that as a spy like immediately."
4817.0,4819.0, Like I just don't pull it off for some reason.
4819.0,4821.0," A lot of the, they've been playing for the week."
4821.0,4822.0, Yeah.
4822.0,4823.0, Yeah.
4823.0,4826.0, So I can be sneaky at shit in the Xbox version.
4826.0,4832.0," I've been playing demo man a lot and spy and, and soldier."
4832.0,4838.0, I would say 0.001% of the people who played team fortress classic are playing it now on the Xbox too.
4838.0,4839.0, Yeah.
4839.0,4840.0, Yeah.
4840.0,4841.0, Good point.
4841.0,4842.0, Yeah.
4842.0,4843.0, They want to be spy though.
4843.0,4846.0," That's like, you know, when all the kids in the playground, they all want to play a great"
4846.0,4847.0, play super friends.
4847.0,4849.0, Then everyone decides they want to be Batman.
4849.0,4852.0," So then like, the, who stuck with a friend or a friend?"
4852.0,4854.0," Like, okay, you're all Batman."
4855.0,4856.0, Then it's not playing super friends.
4856.0,4858.0, You're playing the fucking Clone Wars or whatever.
4858.0,4863.0," I actually, I actually think that it's because the character is so cool looking."
4863.0,4866.0," Like, I think that that's the most of the reason that people are picking in."
4866.0,4869.0, Like when you go to that selection screen and he does the cigarette thing.
4869.0,4870.0, Yeah.
4870.0,4872.0," You're like, damn, that's one of the coolest characters I've ever seen."
4872.0,4876.0," Except then people did on there and they're like, how do I turn into somebody?"
4876.0,4877.0, Yeah.
4877.0,4879.0," And they think it's like, Shang Tsung in like,"
4879.0,4880.0," Oh, come on."
4880.0,4881.0, Because we're four.
4881.0,4883.0," Because we're like, but I didn't transform."
4883.0,4886.0," It's like, you don't transform into a heavy."
4886.0,4887.0, They just think you're one.
4887.0,4889.0, You're still a dude with a knife.
4889.0,4890.0," Oh, God."
4890.0,4891.0, Yeah.
4891.0,4892.0," Like, you don't get there."
4892.0,4894.0," Oh, so they really think they think you can transform."
4894.0,4897.0, But I'm not saying that about everyone playing the X-beats version.
4897.0,4901.0, Because I've had good games with random people who are really into it and were good at it.
4901.0,4903.0, And much better than me at it.
4903.0,4905.0," I'm sure, yeah, give it a few weeks."
4905.0,4906.0," And they'll be like, yeah."
4906.0,4909.0, I hope that there are plenty of people playing it because it's fun.
4909.0,4911.0, And a couple of my friends don't play PC games at all.
4911.0,4914.0, And it's fun to play with them on X-box.
4914.0,4916.0, I wonder about that version.
4916.0,4920.0," The thing I'm wondering about now is that because Valves from patching the PC game,"
4920.0,4923.0, like on it like every other day or so.
4923.0,4926.0, And they're significant like balance patches.
4926.0,4929.0," You know, buffs and nerfs and stuff like that."
4929.0,4932.0," So if you haven't been down, I mean, you can answer to me."
4932.0,4936.0," If you haven't been downloading updates for the X-box one,"
4936.0,4938.0," I wonder what the balances, you know,"
4938.0,4943.0, because the pyro technically in the demo man are going to be significantly different characters.
4943.0,4944.0, Right.
4944.0,4948.0," But if you haven't been conceivable, the bounces use will also be different on the X-box as well."
4948.0,4949.0, No.
4949.0,4950.0," Like, it's the same."
4950.0,4954.0," Well, maybe you don't have to be controlling and the movement things are easier."
4954.0,4956.0," But I don't think so, not in this case."
4956.0,4960.0," I mean, because of the way that they're constantly trying to find the sweet spot for how much damage"
4960.0,4967.0, say that the flame thrower does at what point a grenade should detonate when it doesn't immediately hit someone
4967.0,4968.0, to square in the face.
4968.0,4970.0," I mean, those are issues that are going to be the same."
4970.0,4974.0," I haven't played enough, I guess, of the game to notice any real difference in that."
4974.0,4978.0," People seem to play the same way, like pyro's or out of fucking control."
4978.0,4979.0, They are.
4979.0,4980.0, Yeah.
4980.0,4985.0, But I think the whole controller thing is a little bit overblown.
4985.0,4988.0, I think the problem is you have to crank the sensitivity up all the way.
4988.0,4992.0," And then get used to playing with really small, small, small moments."
4992.0,4993.0, Yeah.
4993.0,4997.0," So, like, if you're a scout then and you're like double jumping around, you can nail like your shock to the head."
4997.0,5000.0," Yeah, except I'm not that great with a scout with a mouse."
5000.0,5003.0," Yeah, I'm not like a total like, you know, shooter-jock."
5003.0,5006.0," So, I'm not, you know, maybe it's that I'm not really fucking ready for that."
5006.0,5007.0, Right.
5007.0,5008.0," If you're not proficient with a mouse, yeah."
5008.0,5011.0, The controller actually is kind of appealing in some ways.
5011.0,5014.0," Because you're like, oh, it's kind of a farmer's food in the mouse."
5014.0,5017.0, But it works just about the same for me.
5017.0,5020.0," Except for vertical motion, it's kind of weird."
5020.0,5027.0," Like, there's something weird about the stress positions you put your thumbs in when you're going at angles and stuff."
5027.0,5028.0, I don't know.
5028.0,5029.0, But it's fun.
5029.0,5031.0, It doesn't kill the game at all.
5031.0,5037.0, I think it stands zero chance against Halo looking at my friends list and how few people are actually playing.
5037.0,5038.0, Mm-hmm.
5038.0,5040.0, And I wish that it would stay with your friends.
5040.0,5041.0, There's plenty of more fortress.
5041.0,5043.0, They just says that playing orange box.
5043.0,5045.0," Oh, that's too bad."
5045.0,5048.0," Yeah, you can't even tell if they're playing team fortress."
5048.0,5055.0," Actually, I think if you go in to a different level into it when you actually select someone's ID,"
5055.0,5058.0, it tells you what they're doing in orange box specifically.
5058.0,5059.0, It does.
5059.0,5060.0, Yeah.
5060.0,5061.0, I need to check that out.
5061.0,5062.0, That's cool.
5062.0,5063.0, Yeah.
5063.0,5064.0, So what else?
5064.0,5065.0, Yes.
5065.0,5067.0, Should I kick off U23?
5067.0,5068.0, We got time.
5068.0,5069.0, We do.
5069.0,5070.0, All right.
5070.0,5071.0, Speaking of multiplayer.
5071.0,5072.0, Okay.
5072.0,5074.0, So I just really quickly.
5074.0,5077.0," I mean, I tried playing the demo this weekend."
5077.0,5081.0, There's a case where you know how before you see OD-4 would have been a bit more from showing off multiplayer.
5081.0,5089.0," I think that this at UT, almost would have been a bit more if they showed up the single player version instead because the net code was definitely not optimized."
5089.0,5091.0, Where'd you hear that?
5091.0,5092.0, Me?
5092.0,5093.0," Well, no, I'm telling you."
5093.0,5094.0, This morning.
5094.0,5095.0," Yeah, we were talking about this morning."
5095.0,5096.0, But it wasn't just you.
5096.0,5097.0, I was talking to David Ellis about this.
5097.0,5099.0, We had the same problem.
5099.0,5104.0," And I mean, I end up trying to play most of the time with the bots because that's how I got it working."
5104.0,5110.0," So I mean, so I mean, what kind of single player is there in this game?"
5110.0,5112.0, Or is it just like bots on the multiplayer maps?
5112.0,5114.0," Well, there is a sort of like a single player is there a campaign?"
5114.0,5116.0," Well, a lot of it can actually answer that one."
5116.0,5117.0," I mean, did they cover still?"
5117.0,5118.0," But yeah, it's relevant."
5118.0,5119.0," Oh, I got it."
5119.0,5121.0," Yeah, I did the last preview on that too, so."
5121.0,5122.0," Yeah, I mean, there was a campaign."
5122.0,5123.0, Yeah.
5123.0,5128.0," I mean, when I went there to talk to them, they didn't have much to show for the campaign."
5128.0,5131.0, They only talked about what they were really planning for it.
5131.0,5134.0, So I haven't seen how it's turned out necessarily.
5134.0,5136.0, It's not what's in the demo.
5136.0,5137.0, Right.
5137.0,5138.0, It's just a couple of apps.
5138.0,5141.0, The campaign and you can also play cooperatively with people.
5141.0,5147.0," And it actually sounds cool in that instead of just bot stuff, they will have like,"
5147.0,5149.0, there's this whole other race of creatures or whatnot.
5149.0,5152.0, You'll have missions where you're fighting against them.
5152.0,5154.0, Those sort of introduce themes.
5154.0,5158.0," So for example, the reason you keep responding is that war isn't a future or"
5158.0,5161.0, fought with like these spawn chamber technologies or whatever.
5161.0,5164.0, So you're going to go and try to like eliminate the enemies spawn chamber.
5164.0,5168.0, So they can't keep coming in and then you can fight a war of a tradition at that point.
5168.0,5173.0, Maybe you'll steal one of their vehicles like a walker or something.
5173.0,5177.0, And you'll be able to use that like later on in another level.
5177.0,5180.0, This is again from what I've been told.
5180.0,5182.0, And then that will play some role in a later level.
5182.0,5187.0," We're hey, you guys now have, you know, your reverse engineer these walkers or something like that."
5187.0,5191.0," So that stuff definitely sounds I mean, they're they're putting something there."
5191.0,5194.0," And there's a lot of you know, customizing your character and all that sort of stuff."
5194.0,5200.0," But, um, but for the demo, it's yeah, it's just the same exact modes that you would play online."
5200.0,5202.0," But with Bob Red, I've read mixed."
5202.0,5204.0, I read mixed reviews on the message board today.
5204.0,5208.0, So today it does sound like there's been a lot of problems with people just connecting at all.
5208.0,5211.0, It's it's the weird things it's labeled.
5211.0,5212.0, It's like a new category.
5212.0,5213.0, It's related to.
5214.0,5217.0, So what it's a beta of the demo.
5219.0,5220.0, Where's it the demo?
5220.0,5222.0, We're going to demo our beta to the beta.
5222.0,5226.0," It's kind of weird because maybe that's like I guess that's what the hail three, you know,"
5226.0,5228.0, beta demo should have been called.
5228.0,5229.0, It's been a beta.
5229.0,5239.0," So it's frustrating to me though, because you know, if you're going to use this to convince people in part and use it in part to convince people that they should buy this game."
5239.0,5247.0, When you get it and there are no dedicated servers any connection you make is just like horrendous to the point that it's nearly unplayable.
5247.0,5251.0," And you're doing your best because you're like, hey, is in the ordinary real game."
5251.0,5252.0, I want to play it.
5252.0,5257.0," But just in it's just the latency is, you know, isn't going to work."
5257.0,5263.0, And it's especially troublesome for me because the game is so fast pace at characters moves so rapidly.
5263.0,5267.0," They have, you know, the evasive maneuvers when you double tap the laws to keys."
5267.0,5271.0," They, you can double jump. You get jump boots and all these other things."
5271.0,5280.0," And when you have a game, a twitch game, you know, to the extent that unreal series is and then you like fuck up the latency in your pain."
5280.0,5285.0," That's like the worst of all worlds. You know, it's like one thing when a heavy weapon guy rubber bands like two inches."
5285.0,5292.0," But when someone's like just, you know, freaking meth jumping all through the map or something and so it looks like a teleporting, you know."
5292.0,5298.0, So it really makes it almost impossible for me to evaluate on that sense.
5298.0,5305.0," But it was difficult because when I did get it to work when I joined small servers, who, you know, maybe four people, six people,"
5305.0,5312.0," people, then when you get to be equal CTF, it's definitely not made for that few for so few players."
5312.0,5315.0," Well, but it was, to get it to come full circle."
5315.0,5321.0," Here's my point is that it, it wasn't really grabbing me. I don't know. I just didn't, it was hard because normally I could tell right away what it did."
5321.0,5328.0," I like or don't like about something. And this time I was playing and, you know, Roy, who I was playing with once again was say, like, you know, it's key playing."
5328.0,5332.0," I was like, I don't know what it is yet, but like, this isn't fun to me."
5332.0,5334.0, And it was weird. I'm still trying to figure it out.
5334.0,5336.0, The performance has a whole lot to do with it.
5336.0,5340.0," But again, like I said, I got to play a few where it worked okay because there were a few of us in there."
5340.0,5341.0, They just got to carry us.
5341.0,5343.0, Did you play against the boss? You're just not into that at all.
5343.0,5348.0, I did a few times when I realized after I tried for three days to find decent matches.
5348.0,5352.0," But I think, yeah, bot play in that circumstances stupid to me."
5352.0,5354.0," Like, I mean, it's just not fun."
5354.0,5360.0," Yeah, well, you know what? I got to disagree with you on this one because I mean, not to the whole multiplayer thing with other players."
5360.0,5366.0," But I enjoy playing some games with bots because sometimes it's just kind of like a, I just want to hang out, play a game really quick and get out."
5366.0,5371.0, And I don't have a problem playing against bots. I jack up the jack up the difficulty and just go on a twitch.
5371.0,5376.0," How many hours would you guess that you played against bots with like UT, you know, to 2004?"
5376.0,5377.0, To be honest with you a lot.
5377.0,5378.0, Like how many?
5378.0,5380.0," I don't know. I mean, if I would have put a number to it."
5380.0,5382.0," I don't know 30, 40. I don't know."
5382.0,5383.0," I mean, like I actually don't."
5383.0,5385.0," Because I'm a fan of, I still don't get excited."
5385.0,5391.0, Because I actually kind of like don't mind going into those maps or I'll download a mod that takes advantage of it.
5391.0,5393.0, And then I'll throw in some bots and just kind of go off.
5393.0,5394.0, Okay.
5394.0,5399.0," Well, I mean, I asked the specific hours because it's like, you know, my classic figure of like a approaching 600 for Battlefield 2."
5399.0,5405.0, And games like that is that while I think people might enjoy playing bots.
5405.0,5411.0, I don't think that anyone that enjoys playing bots enjoys it as much as the rest of us enjoy playing and set their people.
5411.0,5414.0, And that's the disparity between 30 and 600 or something.
5414.0,5422.0," You know, so it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a fair bit of a disparity between spending 30 hours playing a game and spending 600 hours playing."
5422.0,5423.0, Here we go.
5423.0,5424.0, It's a waste of time.
5424.0,5429.0, It's that is that is that one thing is is perfectly acceptable.
5429.0,5432.0, And the other thing is fucking ridiculous.
5436.0,5437.0, It's a good shit.
5439.0,5444.0," Well, I mean, it's safe to say I think with either of these that we're still waiting to see things."
5444.0,5449.0," Yeah, it sounds like both demos kind of it is flopped in a few things you could tell though."
5449.0,5456.0," Like again, you'll like, like you said it makes the reaction some people love it because it's, it's so much like, hey, this is, you know, you T 99 or whatever."
5456.0,5458.0, This is a experience very familiar to me.
5458.0,5464.0, And I've never been that drawn into a UT game where I played it to that ridiculous extent.
5464.0,5468.0, So the extent that I played a team fortress or battlefield or something.
5468.0,5474.0," And there's some stuff that I just don't understand like the vehicles, it's always third person perspective."
5474.0,5477.0, Some cases it's great. Like the man to vehicle.
5477.0,5478.0, I love that thing.
5478.0,5481.0," Yeah, it's one of the coolest vehicles in a game of the sort."
5481.0,5486.0," Just because you have a jump button and you have a building to like pancake, it's bring it down to the ground immediately."
5486.0,5493.0, And use that combination of abilities to smash people to catch them as they're jumping away from you to evade stuff.
5493.0,5495.0, So much fun to use.
5495.0,5503.0," However, other vehicles, you know, like the scorpion the Jeep with the, the place on the front, um, hell bender and some of these other things."
5503.0,5508.0," I just can't even, again, hit the bait hopefully they tweak them, but it's the control like shit to me."
5508.0,5514.0," The, the laser system for all the, again, here's the problem that any game with vehicles."
5514.0,5517.0, And FPS is going to have to have how do you balance the vehicles against players that don't have them.
5517.0,5519.0, How you can balance one vehicle to another.
5519.0,5525.0," And part of it here is that a rocket will just blow you up. You get it, the average rocket and you just point in it."
5525.0,5528.0, So when you get the noddle lock you hold the button down and you blow someone up.
5528.0,5530.0, Their option is to get out of the vehicle.
5530.0,5535.0," But the lasers, they all shoot these kind of like stupid, you know the whole, the shot rifle."
5535.0,5538.0," No, they're talking about vehicle weapons. Oh, sorry."
5538.0,5546.0," So in, you know, in games like QuakeWords or something, even though there are lasers that hyperblast or something, they perform very much like, you know, human ballistic,"
5546.0,5549.0," or something. And it's just like immediate, you pull the trigger boom. You get a result here."
5549.0,5553.0," You shoot this like color piece of shit and it's like,"
5553.0,5557.0, And then someone's running and jumping around.
5557.0,5561.0," It's like instead, it's kind of like, you know, playing a carnival game where they got a swinging, you know,"
5561.0,5564.0, pendulum or something with a bullseye and you got to throw it.
5564.0,5567.0," You got to lead it by, you know, 50 feet and hope for the best at the wind."
5567.0,5570.0," It's like, it's like the moon and it's going."
5570.0,5574.0, You will be destroyed by our picks of death.
5574.0,5578.0, Moving so slow.
5578.0,5583.0," Yeah, that kind of stuff, I mean, I'm not, yeah, there's a lot of balancing things."
5583.0,5586.0," You got to be like, like, some of the vehicles, but again, like I said, other others are great."
5586.0,5591.0," I wish, you know, the hoverboard and I wish, give me the option for to play those in first person perspective, at least,"
5591.0,5597.0," because they, it gets to feel so to rely, especially the aircraft, you know, it just, it has such a different vibe."
5597.0,5603.0," It's hard, you know, it's hard to explain, but it's significant difference and experience for me when I'm playing and I'm driving a vehicle from the"
5603.0,5606.0, different perspectives.
5606.0,5615.0," The thing that sucks, too, is just like, you know, you don't want to be releasing a demo at this point that's even mixed when you've got this scene."
5615.0,5616.0," Yeah, it's just, right?"
5616.0,5618.0," Yeah, it's a vegetarian story out there."
5618.0,5622.0, You can't throw yourself in against those big boys unless you really have something to it.
5622.0,5624.0, And there's been nothing to address it.
5624.0,5625.0, They didn't post a patch for it.
5625.0,5628.0, They didn't post any explanation of what's going on.
5628.0,5632.0," And it's baffling to me why there are no why I can't find, you know, I messed with every filter,"
5632.0,5636.0," you can't find dedicated servers that are because all the paying information that comes back,"
5636.0,5638.0," most of Merzero, most of Merzero, like, you know,"
5638.0,5643.0," 2500 or something ridiculous, and then there's a few that are like 16 that you can't join."
5643.0,5647.0," It's really weird that that the user interface, I mean, that's just nitpicking."
5647.0,5651.0," That's pretty, you know, got awful, but like, yeah, I hope for the better."
5651.0,5653.0," Oh, something else though, you know, this is important."
5653.0,5658.0, I want to bring up because now we know that all these developers are using Unreal Engine 3.
5658.0,5660.0," I even curiously, I don't know if it was a joke or not."
5660.0,5666.0," Someone was supposed to be posting comments from a magazine review of Call Duty 4 and one of the complaints was like,"
5666.0,5671.0," as good as it looks with this engine, it would've looked imagine how much better it would've looked with UE3,"
5671.0,5678.0," which is curious because playing both of these two demos, I was really appreciative of how natural"
5678.0,5685.0," many of, you know, the assets and the environment in Call Duty 4 look compared to UE3."
5685.0,5693.0," And it's not, so again, I should say UT3 because it's definitely what part of it's what Epic's doing with their engine,"
5693.0,5694.0, but it's really weird.
5694.0,5697.0," It looks, everything looks like a Thomas Kincaid painting to me now,"
5697.0,5701.0," who's like the master of techiness, you know, the so called master of light, you know,"
5701.0,5704.0," they got little shops in the mall and everything's just, you know,"
5704.0,5708.0, bloomed out and defused and fuzzy around the edges.
5708.0,5711.0," So you've got rock mountains in there, they're shining."
5711.0,5715.0," And instead of the old Chriscoats, it's very tin foil, everything's like super tin foil."
5715.0,5721.0," And it's just hydrating me now, it's already, it already is like, you know, this looks pretty cheap already"
5721.0,5727.0," and that's kind of scary, like so soon into the, I mean, this should still be the engine that's making me like,"
5727.0,5731.0," wow, you know, going to like technology worship, you know,"
5731.0,5733.0, gamers are so weird.
5733.0,5738.0," I think it's finished, I think it's finished, all these like little things like,"
5738.0,5741.0," you know, this is starting to look a little too shiny."
5741.0,5743.0," You think they're like, they're just mud on that."
5743.0,5747.0, You think they're really bothered by the Barbara Walters interview lighting in this game.
5747.0,5753.0," I wonder if I'm going to move he fancier dead in like the 40s and 50s, like this technicolor."
5753.0,5756.0," You know, it's just really washing everybody out."
5756.0,5757.0, I like the better one it was.
5757.0,5761.0," Fuck you, it's, it's not, it's not gamers."
5761.0,5767.0," It's when you, when you make me go and do a podcast every week and I got to find some new shit to talk about."
5767.0,5774.0," And I've only committed one wing wing story, one meth lab story and one James Yuri."
5774.0,5775.0," Oh, my god."
5775.0,5780.0, Go to talk about the fucking Thomas King K to fact going on in the future.
5780.0,5781.0, It's like blood sport game.
5781.0,5782.0, What's my dude?
5782.0,5783.0, Is it blood sport?
5783.0,5784.0, You're right.
5784.0,5785.0," Thomas, you're right."
5785.0,5787.0," We really have you on the leash on this podcast, Sean."
5787.0,5795.0," Wait, is every, every game we talked about this entire time in first person."
5795.0,5797.0, I don't play it in first place.
5797.0,5799.0, Almost almost all of them.
5799.0,5800.0," Oh, oh, I feel like lately I don't."
5800.0,5801.0, Hopefully he gave it to the first person.
5801.0,5802.0, How many arrows a little bit?
5802.0,5803.0, Okay.
5803.0,5808.0, It's interesting that games have evolved to the point where the main action is your camera man.
5808.0,5811.0, Sometimes you're a camera man that has a gun in the middle that shoots things.
5811.0,5812.0, Yeah.
5812.0,5813.0, But basically you're a camera man.
5813.0,5814.0," Well, I did play world in conflict."
5814.0,5815.0, Yeah.
5815.0,5817.0, And that was a strategy game.
5817.0,5819.0," So that was, you know, yeah."
5819.0,5820.0, That's an RTS.
5820.0,5821.0, So that wasn't in that perspective.
5821.0,5824.0, We need to have a group game of that and we really need to get people to play.
5824.0,5825.0, Company heroes too.
5825.0,5828.0," Well, then conflict looks so great."
5828.0,5833.0," I don't know what it is about that engine, but it was really, really looked beautiful."
5833.0,5834.0, Just on a totally superficial.
5834.0,5835.0, I'm just a bit scared by what you're doing.
5835.0,5839.0, I'm doing it with myself.
5839.0,5840.0, Let me put that down.
5840.0,5842.0, You look overly excited.
5842.0,5844.0," Well, I was talking about one in conflict."
5844.0,5846.0," It was, yeah, it was a moment."
5846.0,5849.0," It, uh, why should probably actually talk about the game."
5849.0,5850.0, But do we have to go?
5850.0,5851.0, We mean podcasting a long time.
5851.0,5852.0, Yeah.
5852.0,5853.0, We do this every week.
5853.0,5855.0," Well, then we talk about one in conflict."
5855.0,5856.0, We can talk about one in conflict.
5856.0,5857.0, We can talk about all the stuff we have not played.
5857.0,5858.0, I have not played about.
5858.0,5860.0, I've not played multiplayer at all.
5860.0,5861.0, Ninety-foon for one minute.
5861.0,5865.0," I want to play the single player campaign, which is every been to us."
5865.0,5872.0," It's kind of this red dawn rush a attacks the US storyline, which actually I'm really enjoying quite a bit."
5872.0,5873.0, I'm a few missions in.
5873.0,5877.0, I don't know if it gets old in the early part of the single player campaign.
5877.0,5879.0, This whole rush a attacks the adult thing.
5879.0,5881.0," It's been, uh, which the quiet."
5881.0,5882.0, The quiet.
5882.0,5886.0," The box claims to be a chillingly real, chillingly plausible story."
5886.0,5889.0, We are destroy all your flannel shirts.
5889.0,5890.0, Yeah.
5890.0,5892.0, I just cut co-bane.
5892.0,5894.0, I spit on your grunge.
5894.0,5896.0, That was 84 or 89.
5896.0,5897.0," Yeah, good."
5897.0,5898.0," Yeah, yeah."
5898.0,5899.0, Yeah.
5899.0,5903.0," That's definitely how they found that, uh, they've just declassified Soviet plans."
5903.0,5906.0," And their entire Cold War strategy, uh, basically entailed."
5906.0,5910.0," First strike was, you know, see, we originally thought it would be a massive launch of IBM."
5910.0,5912.0," IBM, ICBMs and Spoof, ICBMs."
5912.0,5917.0," Uh, rather they're going to land a amphibious force in, um,"
5917.0,5918.0, Puget Sound.
5918.0,5919.0, Uh-huh.
5919.0,5921.0," And they're, no, it's all very chillingly plausible."
5921.0,5922.0, Right.
5922.0,5926.0," And they land in like up in, uh, like, it's like passenger disguised passenger boats."
5926.0,5927.0, That's like what I wanted.
5927.0,5930.0," Yeah, they snuck the other, and the amphibious Trojan horse through."
5930.0,5933.0, That's kind of what's going to be carrying pink flaming plastic lawnfaming.
5933.0,5936.0, It's the rush army is fueled by fresh seafood.
5936.0,5939.0, And so they have to have a port to see.
5939.0,5941.0, Now you think you're with wing wings.
5941.0,5942.0, Okay.
5942.0,5945.0," You're making fun of this game and the pop, but, but actually what I, uh,"
5945.0,5952.0," I did actually enjoy that it was an RTS that, uh, that was, uh, you know,"
5952.0,5957.0, it was not dissimilar to company ferros and these other war game ten things.
5957.0,5960.0," And it really was a different, at least a different environment."
5960.0,5962.0, It was not fantasy.
5962.0,5963.0, It was not sci-fi.
5963.0,5965.0, And it was not World War II.
5965.0,5969.0," It was, it was actually a military setting set in, you know,"
5969.0,5971.0," Continental United States, which is kind of neat."
5971.0,5975.0," Yeah, it's also, you know, um, I mean, the maps you're on, like in early on in the game,"
5975.0,5978.0," you know, you're driving your tanks down downtown."
5978.0,5979.0, Yeah.
5979.0,5981.0, And it's kind of plausible as this scenario is.
5981.0,5985.0," It's like it's, it's all, it's so easy for us to imagine it because of,"
5985.0,5987.0," I mean, having lived through that era of, you know,"
5987.0,5990.0, the second called Grig or part two paranoia.
5990.0,5991.0, Right.
5991.0,5995.0," And they're something, you know, all the things that they, that they shot to you all the random,"
5995.0,6001.0," uh, uh, sound file blurbs that come at you are also, you know, they're so incredibly"
6001.0,6004.0, gingoistic pro-America because America's being attacked.
6004.0,6007.0," So, you know, it's like a great excuse for, I mean, everything that's in there."
6007.0,6010.0," Well, show these commies with the US is made of."
6010.0,6013.0," I mean, that's like what every other, every other line is."
6013.0,6015.0," And it's like, uh, boy, then nostalgia."
6015.0,6016.0, Yeah.
6016.0,6018.0, When it was just the commies and we could hate them.
6018.0,6021.0, And now we can really hate them because they're attacking our country.
6021.0,6023.0, Isn't it the game developed in Sweden?
6023.0,6024.0," To, uh, yeah."
6024.0,6025.0, Yeah.
6025.0,6026.0, Yeah.
6026.0,6027.0, We hear it.
6027.0,6030.0," So far, I'm enjoying it a lot, but I guess more on that one, we actually have more time."
6030.0,6034.0," Once again, to talk to many games, to many games."
6034.0,6037.0," Well, if we're not talking about this week, let me at least say for company here's,"
6037.0,6041.0," um, whether you have a posing front or not, I started, um,"
6041.0,6045.0, a sort of meet and greet thread on the one-up forums.
6045.0,6046.0, So go there.
6046.0,6048.0, My name is Obesia.
6048.0,6054.0," Oh, and we've been playing notes all about, you know, good 3v3, 4v4 games."
6054.0,6057.0," And yeah, just don't be on Sean's team or he'll grief you."
6057.0,6058.0, I'd like to talk about this.
6058.0,6061.0," You know, it's like, for a posing front, it's like every week."
6061.0,6062.0," God, we'll talk about it."
6062.0,6063.0, I know.
6063.0,6066.0," But it's, yes, we, it's so, I still continue to think it actually,"
6066.0,6071.0, it was the game that wrestled me away from TF2 and I've been playing it nonstop.
6071.0,6074.0," Now, have stuff to complain about, like, I mean, just general thoughts that, you know,"
6074.0,6078.0," maybe when you guys play, and again for me, it's a game about, like, as much as,"
6078.0,6081.0," you know, at work as they put into the campaigns, about playing it online."
6081.0,6083.0, But it's also very intimidating game.
6083.0,6087.0," I think for a lot of people, and I was just, you know, kind of thinking about ways in which"
6087.0,6091.0, you can basically do the team fortress approach to that kind of game.
6091.0,6095.0," Maybe in some ways, that's what World of conflict is, you know, the TF2 of our TS2."
6095.0,6096.0, I don't know.
6096.0,6098.0, But ways to get people.
6098.0,6103.0," So far in the campaign, the campaign is incredibly easy where I'm at so far."
6103.0,6107.0," I'm not sure if it's just because this is just, yeah, basically, like a tutorial for the"
6107.0,6110.0," multiplayer, ultimately, or what."
6110.0,6115.0," But how do they break down the single player to you do, like, the air units, or you're taking control of the"
6115.0,6118.0," infantry units, because in multiplayer, that's how it works."
6118.0,6121.0," Well, right now, and I'm only three missions into the campaign."
6121.0,6124.0, It's been all the ground groundwork today.
6124.0,6128.0," And it's also very much just like handholding you through what's a story, a very linear"
6128.0,6131.0, storyline of what happens to the US here.
6131.0,6137.0," So they're just, you know, it's, obviously this game appears to me to be all about the"
6137.0,6140.0," multiplayer, ultimately, is what they're going for here."
6140.0,6143.0, But I've not played enough to speak about that.
6143.0,6147.0, What they need at all is some kind of some damn stop letting people make
6147.0,6152.0," some more accounts, like you make an account, and that's your stats, and you have to"
6152.0,6153.0, stick with them.
6153.0,6156.0," So if you go in and you suck too bad, you're going to have to fight your way out of a whole."
6156.0,6159.0," If you kick ass, then people are going to know that you didn't make sure you do a"
6159.0,6161.0, account and join a server called Noob's only.
6161.0,6165.0," Please honest to God, we really suck, and then just go beat the shit out of everyone."
6165.0,6166.0, Right.
6166.0,6170.0," So finding ways like that, I mean, because I think that's the impediment."
6170.0,6173.0," I really like, you know, for a company, I think it's such a fantastic game."
6173.0,6177.0," And it's, there's like no, I'm literally the only person in this entire building,"
6177.0,6181.0," in the tires that they've just game grew, who's playing this game, or who played,"
6181.0,6183.0," you know, you guys played a little bit, though."
6183.0,6186.0," And it's not saying it's good, but I'm like, in my mind, that's a bad situation"
6186.0,6189.0, because I think the game is that fantastic.
6189.0,6192.0," And it's like, we should all be playing and talking about it, but it's like intimidating."
6192.0,6194.0, I think that's part of the reason.
6194.0,6197.0," I mean, aside from the issues of it being PC and this, and that,"
6197.0,6203.0," yeah, like finding ways to make these games as deep as they are and as complex as they are for"
6203.0,6209.0," people of one tier, but then offering different iterations of it and group sorting players by"
6209.0,6212.0, skill and experience and stuff like that.
6212.0,6216.0," I mean, I say that as someone who wants to see more people play it, but right,"
6216.0,6220.0," hey, again, we have people with players of all kind of skill levels joining us,"
6220.0,6223.0, so go to the forums and add and we'll play with you.
6223.0,6227.0," Yeah, I was also going to say about what in conflict you just reminded me to that,"
6227.0,6231.0," like, like, to me as I was playing this last night and because it was so easy and,"
6231.0,6236.0," and it was so beautiful looking and the storyline is so, it's so fun."
6236.0,6241.0," I thought, like, this is a game that should have like way more people playing it right now."
6241.0,6245.0," There's a lot of people at an entry level of strategy games, so I think would,"
6245.0,6247.0," would think that this was actually a lot of fun, right?"
6247.0,6252.0, Just based on the whole setting and I think part of the reason it's not going to is because of the
6252.0,6253.0, fucking name.
6253.0,6256.0," You know, I was thinking about less, it just sounds like everything."
6256.0,6260.0, It took me and I run this magazine to took me like two months to get into my head
6260.0,6262.0, between Universal War and World in conflict.
6262.0,6264.0, They sound like the same fucking game to me.
6264.0,6268.0, I just saw a demo for a game called conflict denied ops.
6268.0,6272.0," See, and this is a bit about like, you could, I don't know,"
6272.0,6274.0, commies attack whatever.
6274.0,6277.0," There's like a million Git names, you could maybe not that one,"
6277.0,6281.0," but you could come up with a game, you know, America under attack."
6281.0,6285.0," You know, Russian invasion, I don't know, something world in compression invasion."
6285.0,6288.0," There's a separate thing to tell, as far as I can tell,"
6288.0,6291.0," that style of game, like the marketing people all they ever say is,"
6291.0,6293.0, needs more balls.
6293.0,6295.0," Like that's how they, that's how they name things."
6295.0,6297.0," Like they might come over there, right?"
6297.0,6299.0," Nope, nope, or balls."
6299.0,6300.0," Yeah, we're already calling."
6300.0,6301.0, It is marketing people.
6301.0,6304.0," Like, you know, like, when opposing fronts when we did that story,"
6304.0,6305.0, they didn't have the name.
6305.0,6308.0, It wasn't until I had already finished the story that I had to go back in and
6308.0,6309.0, paste the name in.
6309.0,6313.0, And that was because they had hundreds of options up front of all the marketing
6313.0,6316.0," people and stuff, and then they narrow it down to a few."
6316.0,6319.0," And same to a project origins, another game we've covered recently,"
6319.0,6320.0, like what the fuck is that?
6320.0,6323.0," Like origin would have been so much better, or any,"
6323.0,6325.0," or a number of things, you know, but like, way, what?"
6325.0,6328.0, But one legendary the box.
6328.0,6329.0," Oh, it's a real nice."
6329.0,6331.0, That's my favorite new one.
6331.0,6333.0, What do you mean?
6333.0,6334.0, The legendary box?
6334.0,6336.0," No, it's not even grammatically correct."
6336.0,6338.0," Even, I mean, let's be fair, the orange box."
6338.0,6339.0, The fuck does that mean?
6339.0,6340.0, Yeah.
6340.0,6342.0, That means you got red hair upstairs and downstairs.
6342.0,6345.0, Wow.
6345.0,6346.0, All right.
6346.0,6347.0, I don't know why.
6347.0,6352.0," I thought that has to have, I don't think it's the relationship."
6352.0,6354.0, Is that a box club?
6354.0,6355.0, Yeah.
6355.0,6356.0, I'm an athlete.
6356.0,6357.0, I came to win this.
6357.0,6358.0, Yeah.
6358.0,6359.0, This game has rid here.
6359.0,6360.0, All right.
6360.0,6361.0, Don't ruin it.
6361.0,6362.0, Yeah.
6362.0,6363.0, I've never done already.
6363.0,6367.0," Oh, and then the last thing about opposing front something in the speed around"
6367.0,6371.0," is that, which I should say is a speed around now, because Ryan and Darren have left"
6371.0,6372.0, a very far-ready life.
6372.0,6373.0, Yeah.
6373.0,6374.0, Yeah.
6374.0,6375.0, It's slipped out.
6375.0,6380.0," But is that, oh, they patch it so frequently, which is good in the sign of their, you know,"
6380.0,6384.0," they have a lot of their own text and they've got to continue support stuff where, but however,"
6384.0,6388.0, the patches changed the balance of the game significantly.
6388.0,6392.0," And unlike say, okay, well, maybe I can't get away with the same shit."
6392.0,6394.0, Playing pyro as I did last week.
6394.0,6398.0, It might radically alter your whole game plan for your third order.
6398.0,6400.0, What I need to focus on.
6400.0,6403.0," What, and so when this happens, like even every other week, it takes so long to get"
6403.0,6407.0," comfortable with an army and say, okay, I own this experience."
6407.0,6410.0, It's going to get entirely rolled over and mocked.
6410.0,6414.0," And then they just flip it all, you know, they, but this is this is common strategy."
6414.0,6415.0, Yeah.
6415.0,6417.0," I mean, start graph to this just because it's common."
6417.0,6419.0, Doesn't I'm a relatively new RTS player.
6419.0,6420.0, Yeah.
6420.0,6423.0, And I can say just because something's common doesn't necessarily mean it's good.
6423.0,6424.0, Right.
6424.0,6425.0, Of course.
6425.0,6426.0," But this is, it's the same dynamic as in a shooter."
6426.0,6428.0," There's, you got people complaining about it."
6428.0,6431.0," It's not even being over balance or, you know, or two powerful."
6431.0,6432.0, I don't know.
6432.0,6435.0," But the difference is in the, I don't think it changes, like I said."
6435.0,6438.0," If you make the pyro twice as powerful, I mean, and then they, no, it's done that."
6438.0,6442.0," But say if you did, think of how long it takes you to get that, whereas if what"
6442.0,6448.0," if they change properties for like 17 different units in your army and the timing on them, the effect"
6448.0,6453.0," that they did their weaknesses, their, you know, what they were, I mean, that's really going"
6453.0,6454.0, to mess up your game plan.
6454.0,6458.0, So if you're used to doing a certain thing and you go and play and you might not know it all.
6458.0,6463.0," It's not just like, okay, pyro, burn, hurt, die, don't do the backbone of your pyro."
6463.0,6467.0," It's like, sure, it takes a while and then you gradually have to like, okay, well, what are these guys"
6467.0,6468.0, good for now?
6468.0,6470.0," Well, guys, you used to be good for this."
6470.0,6471.0, Now apparently they suck at it.
6471.0,6472.0, What do I do?
6472.0,6476.0," And the flip side, like, I can't really speak to our multiplayer RTS is because I don't play"
6476.0,6480.0," them online very often, but like, in a memo, every time there's a new patch, like, and the world"
6480.0,6485.0," to work after my priest is getting totally overhauled again, that's almost like, oh, cool."
6485.0,6490.0," Like, I get to kind of relearn some of these things that I've been using so often."
6490.0,6492.0," There's kind of that flip side, where you're just like, this is slightly refreshing and"
6492.0,6493.0, somewhat.
6493.0,6497.0," If it's too frequent though, like I said, I get sucks because I spend so much time like"
6497.0,6503.0, trying to avoid my prat falls as a new RTS player and they're so annoying.
6503.0,6505.0," And that's, I go into play game and so on."
6505.0,6506.0, Kicks mass.
6506.0,6510.0, I want to start up the next game and be the exact same army that just kick my ass.
6510.0,6515.0," So like, retarding my learning process for anyone and like a week, this for gimmick wins."
6515.0,6521.0," Like, if I can do like some kind of all or nothing game it and I win, like, you know, within"
6521.0,6527.0," the first couple minutes, I'll go for that even though it's like basically also means that they do just this one thing differently."
6527.0,6533.0, It's going to like fuck up my whole plan and then leave me open to like total annihilation on the side.
6533.0,6539.0, So I'm kind of like weaning myself off of those and like not playing with gimmicks and just like playing by
6539.0,6545.0," understanding every unit and the the enemies units and sort of like, like, most normal people."
6545.0,6546.0, Like most normal.
6546.0,6547.0, Right.
6547.0,6554.0, gimmick victories are tempting though man there are serious sirens on because when you want someone gets you with one and that's how they kind of like circulate.
6554.0,6559.0, Someone will do one to you and you say the replay and look sure you like shit that is effective.
6559.0,6561.0, Then you go to the Lord of the Rings.
6561.0,6562.0, That's it.
6562.0,6564.0, What the fuck is that?
6564.0,6567.0, Give me my dad out of this.
6567.0,6568.0, Okay.
6568.0,6570.0, All right.
6570.0,6571.0, Do that's it.
6571.0,6572.0, Fuck.
6572.0,6573.0, That's your way.
6573.0,6574.0, Tell me it's over.
6574.0,6575.0, Tell me.
6576.0,6577.0, Is it over?
6577.0,6578.0, It's over.
6578.0,6579.0, What?
6579.0,6580.0, What?
6580.0,6581.0, I know that.
6581.0,6585.0, I'm a little bit older than you.
6585.0,6588.0, I think I'm a little bit older than you.
6588.0,6589.0, We'll see you next week.
6589.0,6590.0, It's all have cake.
6590.0,6591.0, Okay.
6591.0,6592.0, All right.
