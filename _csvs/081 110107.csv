62.36,65.56, We're all jacked up on candy. Halloween stories. Let's start.
65.56,69.16," Well, you have to introduce yourselves first. We have to do that."
69.16,73.4," I'm Jeff Green. My name is Sean Elliott one time. When I was like six, you"
73.4,76.44, went trick treating my cousin old lady down the block.
76.44,79.96, Gave us apples. My cousin wasn't feeling that. Spin on her face.
79.96,84.75999999999999," No doubt. Wow. Who's up next? Sean, we'll see you on a pressure."
84.76,89.48," Yeah, I know. I want to talk about how crappy this paint job on this plastic pumpkin hit is."
89.48,93.56," Wow, you're right. Wow. That is really that's seriously true. Yeah. It's awful."
93.56,98.44, Is that straight from Walgreens? It's well. It's a merry-go-round. It came from a community.
98.44,101.96000000000001," Some game company brought this to us yesterday. Then they filled it with candy, but you're right."
101.96000000000001,106.52000000000001, They bought the cheapest ass plastic orange pumpkin with a real. This is like a magic
106.52000000000001,110.36000000000001, marker. They've had 30 years to perfect that technology. I had that exact pumpkin when I was
110.6,114.6," a kid. You're right. Look, they didn't even color in the eye all the way."
114.6,119.16," How lame. It's like display the stencils off by like, yeah, they were somebody in the"
119.16,123.96, factors. It was like whatever. They're tall. Salad. Plus or minus 3000%.
125.24,129.56," I said when you looked at it, we knew because like, yes, for 30 years, this is the same one"
129.56,133.16," that, you know, my cousin was holding when he spit on that old bag's face."
133.16,137.07999999999998," And you're like, so it's got to be made in America, right? But everything else is what we got a"
137.08,143.4, single piece of plastic. They couldn't paint the fucking black eye on and match the stencil to the thing.
143.4,147.88000000000002," But look, someone bought it anyway. They were right at a Hong Kong or anywhere. You can get some toy"
147.88000000000002,151.96," with like 600 parts and screws and stuff in it. And it's like, oh, you know, made with nano"
151.96,156.60000000000002, technology. Anything in Crispin's office that'll talk back to you when you come in and make
156.60000000000002,162.12," you feel like you're loved. And this thing right here, you can even paint the eyeball on there."
162.12,167.88," Right. Maybe it was made by like a German. He actually, right. It was in a apprentice. This was his first job."
168.76,173.4," Somebody bossed. It was to be a pile of these somewhere in the back of the, in the back of the factory,"
173.4,178.04," where they thrown. I like the handmade touch. You could tell that this is, it's not what it is."
178.04,184.04000000000002," Try. Yeah. Yeah. So what, what are your names? What else, who's this guy right here? Ryan Scott?"
184.04000000000002,190.04000000000002, Do you have a good Halloween story for us? No. What's your favorite can now? What's my favorite candy?
190.44,197.23999999999998, Yeah. So we only have a lot of fun. You're useless. What's the last costume you're
197.23999999999998,201.56, member dressing up as before you before you stop before you got too old for it? Or are you yet?
201.56,206.76," Michael Myers. Michael Myers. That's pretty good. The company. Do you know what Michael Myers,"
206.76,213.23999999999998," the PR guy? Do you? That's a, that is a, that's a, that's a game company insider joke."
214.20000000000002,218.44, There's a PR guy in Mike Myers. I think Michael Myers though. That's like when you go to the
218.44,224.52," place of spirit Halloween superstar five hours before Halloween proper and all you get is the,"
224.52,231.0," the screen mask and pirate sword. So it was at one of those plastic, one of those plastic masks with"
231.0,236.36," a little, the little mouth hole in it that you know, it was like a good Michael Myers mask."
236.36,241.4," Well, I have a good, like a full mask now. One of the plastic things with a string. It was like an actual"
241.48000000000002,247.0," Michael Myers mask that I played by, well, isn't the Michael Myers mask an inside out Captain Kirk"
247.0,253.0, mask? Yeah. It was a William Schetner mask spray painted white with hair. Really? You were
253.0,260.2," a William Schetner inside out. No, that's awesome. A bad teleportation, bad beehive."
262.68,265.4," Who does the policy, policy, policy, right?"
265.4,274.12," Okay. To save the same technology that's responsible for the fly. That's right. You know,"
274.12,280.52," go, you don't just do not play with that. So we got it. Gotta get any, you know, his got"
280.52,285.56," Halloween story, you're just dying to share. He said no. Anyone, anyone that's going to"
285.56,290.67999999999995," throw any one from the first Christmas turn. Well, I mean, like the most depressing Halloween"
290.68,292.38, was the year of the Tylenol scared?
292.38,293.22, Do you remember it?
293.22,294.22, Yeah.
294.22,296.18, That was like no one had their lights on.
296.18,297.18, Right.
297.18,299.82," It's still dope, my name is."
299.82,301.26, But the nice thing that I do remember
301.26,302.86," that yours, that you still got the houses"
302.86,303.96000000000004, and they would give you money.
303.96000000000004,305.2, That'd give you like a quarter.
305.2,306.86, Because they didn't want any part of it.
306.86,307.5, Yeah.
307.5,308.5, You can't buy shit.
308.5,309.5, Just to get you out of here.
309.5,310.5, You had like six blocks.
310.5,311.5," And you've got like, you know,"
311.5,312.5, 20 bucks.
312.5,313.5, I never wrote it.
313.5,314.5, It was pennies.
314.5,315.5," Oh, man."
315.5,316.5, And then you take the toss some pennies in your bag.
316.5,317.5, You take that.
317.5,318.74, That was when you start taking your stuff
318.74,320.64," into the hospital to get it x-rayed, right?"
320.88,321.47999999999996," Oh, I remember that."
321.47999999999996,322.28, You had a trick of cheating.
322.28,323.59999999999997, Let's go the hospital for the needles.
323.59999999999997,324.78, You did x-rayed.
324.78,325.47999999999996," So you can eat her, and you can eat her."
325.47999999999996,326.47999999999996," I'm like, you know."
326.47999999999996,327.47999999999996, Yeah.
327.47999999999996,328.88, That's hard warming.
328.88,330.47999999999996, God bless America.
330.47999999999996,331.88, This tastes like cancer.
331.88,332.38, Yeah.
332.38,334.88, Yeah.
334.88,335.88, Yeah.
335.88,338.96," I always hate, I hate like my daughter's like a little bit."
338.96,341.76," I'm like, she's too cool to trick or treat with dad anymore."
341.76,344.24, But a few years ago when we were still trick or treating
344.24,347.56, as a family before I was excommunicated.
347.56,349.15999999999997, Like you'd walk down the neighborhood
349.16,350.8, where people are given away.
350.8,351.92, And there's always like the house.
351.92,353.20000000000005, You know they're home.
353.20000000000005,354.68, And they got like the front lightsax.
354.68,355.68, They don't want to participate.
355.68,357.52000000000004, That's like such a fuck you.
357.52000000000004,359.24, Turn your fucking light on.
359.24,361.40000000000003, Go spend $10 and pass on some candy.
361.40000000000003,362.72, How fucking?
362.72,364.56," Like a paid full-tookie man, E.D."
364.56,366.96000000000004, You have to be to not want to give little kids candy.
366.96000000000004,368.32000000000005, I thought it was a way.
368.32000000000005,369.52000000000004, I know.
369.52000000000004,371.52000000000004, I'm busy.
371.52000000000004,372.76000000000005, I have stuff to do.
372.76000000000005,373.8, It depends where you're at.
373.8,374.64000000000004, I don't.
374.64000000000004,376.28000000000003, This yesterday morning on the bar.
376.28,377.59999999999997," Coming in, there's this dude."
377.59999999999997,380.52," Bart is Barry, a rapper, transits are local little,"

392.52,393.52, Sure.
393.52,394.47999999999996, And as you blow on it and he's blowing that.
394.47999999999996,396.0, And everyone's facing happy new year.
396.0,397.55999999999995," And it's like you could tell like,"
397.55999999999995,400.23999999999995, I just woke it up and I was just trying to read this new book I got.
400.23999999999995,402.23999999999995," And you're, you know what?"
402.23999999999995,403.08, It's just different.
403.08,405.08," In your mind you're like, this guy's thinking like,"
405.08,406.91999999999996, I'm here just for guys like you.
406.91999999999996,407.44, Right.
407.44,409.52," You know, you're just like, all you stood up."
409.52,410.12, Right.
410.12,410.32, Yeah.
410.32,412.44," I'm here to remind you happy to say like, no, dude,"
412.44,414.91999999999996, you're dumbass blowing a stupid heart in my fucking face.
414.91999999999996,415.76, But try to read.
415.76,416.76, I don't try.
416.76,418.71999999999997, This is a commute train in the morning.
418.71999999999997,419.4, Right.
419.4,421.4," Jeff, don't bring your kid into my house for Halloween."
421.4,422.4, Yeah.
422.4,427.08," I'm, you can be a crumudgeon like, anti, anti holiday guy on the commute"
427.08,427.59999999999997, train.
427.59999999999997,431.36, But when it's Halloween night and all the houses around you all have their lights
431.36,432.44, on in the ghost town.
432.44,434.44, What if there's the old lady that got spittered?
435.4,435.6, It should.
435.6,436.8, She learned a lesson.
436.8,441.04," If you're in the house and you're like, yeah, you're like 90 years old"
441.04,444.28," and you got, I don't know, boils on your face or whatever."
444.28,446.0," Then okay, you get a pass."
446.0,447.0," But if you're like some like,"
447.0,449.12, you'll be couple who's just inside and you want to watch
449.12,451.64, desperate has wise and you don't want to be bothered by the kids.
451.64,452.2, Fuck you.
452.2,453.88," Oh, not the Gilmore girls."
453.88,455.76," Hey, shut up."
455.76,457.64," In the city, there are no kids."
457.64,458.8, San Francisco doesn't have children.
458.8,459.88, So you're not really bothered.
459.88,462.76," But I saw homeless guy yesterday wearing a, uh,"
463.24,466.24, rubber banded on vampire mask and we were walking for lunch.
466.24,467.76," And I was like, hey, look, it's Grandpa Munster."
468.76,471.96," And on the way past, some guys did have, and my group had some,"
471.96,472.64, some candy.
472.64,473.71999999999997, We dropped in his hat.
473.71999999999997,474.92, And I don't think he thought it was funny.
474.92,476.71999999999997, He was not out there.
476.71999999999997,478.28, Why was he wearing a costume?
478.28,481.08," I think he thought, you know, because homeless people here really have"
481.08,482.32, to try hard to get noticed.
482.32,482.68, Yeah.
482.68,485.68," So I thought he had given that edge, but instead he got candy, which is,"
485.68,488.44, I'm sure not going to go well with his diabetes anyways.
488.44,492.03999999999996," I like when that, when that early homeless meme started going around"
492.04,494.68," to my, the funny or homeless guy started doing that, you know,"
494.68,496.04, need money for bear thing.
496.04,498.44," Like the first couple of times he thought that you saw that, you were like,"
498.44,499.24," hey, that's funny."
499.24,501.40000000000003, I'm actually going to give him money because it's true.
501.40000000000003,503.08000000000004," And then you know, they all do it."
503.08000000000004,505.12, And you had that big discussion at dinner too.
505.12,506.96000000000004, So I ran into this bum the other day.
506.96000000000004,510.6," And then you ended up in the podcast doing, what?"
510.6,513.8000000000001, That was better.
513.8000000000001,515.64," No, how many times you're watching?"
515.64,517.88, He've all had a circumstance right where you're with someone.
517.88,520.12," And you're like, this guy's signed it said like,"
520.68,523.5600000000001, my ninjas stole my family and killed my dog.
523.5600000000001,525.52," And you're like, that guy, he was funny."
525.52,527.84, So I'm going to give him a money.
527.84,529.2, It's not funny.
529.2,530.2, You win money.
532.6,535.92," I saw some guy, some guy walking down the street yesterday dresses"
535.92,537.72, on my space page.
537.72,538.72, What does that look like?
538.72,543.4," He just, he had like a cardboard thing with like my space"
543.4,544.16, S.
545.36,547.12," Whoa, did it have any chalk?"
547.12,548.72, Did it have a troll on it or anything?
548.72,549.5600000000001, It's like a comic book.
549.5600000000001,550.4, No music blur.
550.4,551.12, And like he had a lot of bass.
551.12,552.6800000000001, There was like a cutout where he put his hair.
552.6800000000001,554.84, We put it over it like on his head.
554.84,555.8000000000001, So he has hit your.
555.8000000000001,557.76, I understand there were lots of companion cubes
557.76,559.9200000000001, at the various game industry Halloween.
559.9200000000001,562.1600000000001," There were, there was a lot more,"
562.1600000000001,564.36, there was a lot more orange box theme costumes.
564.36,566.44, And a lot of buyer shocked theme costumes.
566.44,568.52," Oh, and really no halo theme costumes."
568.52,569.12, But I don't know where they were.
569.12,571.5600000000001, You'd have to like go the full.
571.5600000000001,573.08, And now we did keep putting it.
573.08,576.24," So like if you get the gorilla costume from Halloween spirit,"
576.24,578.2," or the spirit Halloween superstore,"
578.2,580.1600000000001," you might be confused for something or the other,"
580.1600000000001,581.76," or if you get just like a group,"
581.76,585.44, any random rubber mask that some kid just
585.44,587.48," that has a subscription to Fangore, yeah,"
587.48,588.6400000000001, made in his spare time.
588.6400000000001,592.88, And something like that.
592.88,593.88, The carve out spirit.
593.88,596.2, Let's get a very super edition helmets
596.2,598.08, that they got when they bought that.
598.08,600.32, Find some way to do it.
600.32,601.2," Well, that's because it's easy."
601.2,604.5200000000001," I hear you guys making these snide, backhanded remarks"
604.5200000000001,605.0400000000001, about halo.
605.0400000000001,607.2," But the thing is, is anyone,"
607.5200000000001,609.6400000000001," take a few stitched together a few rags,"
609.6400000000001,611.84, or just take a styrofoam cube and paint a heart on it
611.84,614.08, and say that they have something to do with orange box.
614.08,615.48, But you need skill.
615.48,618.2800000000001," You need technical, if you're going to seriously,"
618.2800000000001,620.44, if you're going to make a Spartan.
620.44,622.24, And it's don't say messaging because it's
622.24,625.2," formus, a Spartan space marine armor."
625.2,625.4000000000001, Right?
625.4000000000001,626.24, Marks.
626.24,627.5200000000001, Marks are just new righteous.
627.5200000000001,629.5200000000001, Marks are just not generally marked too.
629.5200000000001,631.5600000000001, Usually we sell an armor.
631.5600000000001,635.2, And we put some track cards next to them.
635.44,639.12, We sold so many similar stone more and more track.
639.12,640.8000000000001, Unless we're.
640.8000000000001,645.36," Well, that company that made the Spartan armor,"
645.36,646.5200000000001, they were forced to quit.
646.5200000000001,648.4000000000001, That was like nightmare armor.com.
648.4000000000001,650.76, They used to make really realistic.
650.76,652.76, Like as realistic looking as the guys who dress like
652.76,655.5600000000001," stunt troopers, they would make the Spartan armor."
655.5600000000001,656.96," But my mother's self was like,"
656.96,657.88, you can't make money off of our.
657.88,658.5600000000001, That's cool.
658.5600000000001,659.4000000000001, IP.
659.4000000000001,661.44," Now they do, they do other armor that's"
661.44,662.44, vaguely related to games.
662.44,664.2," But yeah, do those stunt trooper guys"
664.2,665.76, still get work.
665.76,666.12, Do they?
666.12,669.2," Because there's guys and cities all over the country,"
669.2,669.72, right?
669.72,670.0, Yeah.
670.0,670.6400000000001, They have these.
670.6400000000001,672.0400000000001," I mean, there's like a name for them, right?"
672.0400000000001,672.84, Isn't there like some.
672.84,673.5600000000001," Yeah, they're like, yeah, they're like some."
673.5600000000001,674.36, They're like the illusion.
674.36,675.36, Yeah.
675.36,675.88, Yeah.
675.88,678.5600000000001, They're like the new Civil War Reenactor.
678.5600000000001,679.1600000000001, Right.
679.1600000000001,679.72, fictional.
679.72,682.32, I just wonder if there's less call for them now.
682.32,683.4000000000001, They're all just sitting around and they're
683.4000000000001,685.5600000000001," meaning going, but they're like,"
685.5600000000001,687.1600000000001, we need to get some Spartan armor.
687.1600000000001,688.1600000000001, Right.
688.1600000000001,689.0," You know, that one's calm."
689.0,690.08, I think more than man.
690.08,692.9200000000001, And this stuff's uncomfortable.
692.92,694.8399999999999," And they're never, there's always like the, you know,"
694.8399999999999,698.0," the boa fett guy, and like Darth Vader, all these guys"
698.0,700.0, put all this money in effort into their costumes.
700.0,700.28, Right.
700.28,701.56," Because Lucas doesn't pay them, right?"
701.56,702.4799999999999, They gotta do this themselves.
702.4799999999999,703.0, Right.
703.0,703.1999999999999, Yeah.
703.1999999999999,705.68," But then they're like, you know, 300 pounds."
705.68,708.0799999999999," It's like why not work on the other part of the costume,"
708.0799999999999,710.28," which is actually, you know, getting into it."
710.28,712.12, Yeah.
712.12,714.8399999999999, My disbelief or not suspended.
714.8399999999999,715.56," Yeah, true."
715.56,717.12, Fat for a stormtrooper.
717.12,719.5999999999999," Yeah, we're so, yeah, you got to the Lucas Art Parties"
719.5999999999999,720.5999999999999, and these guys are there.
720.5999999999999,722.1999999999999," And there's always the one guy, yeah."
722.2,725.76, Usually it doesn't have the head thing on because it can't fit either.
725.76,728.76," So, you know, fat bearded dude."
728.76,730.84," If you're a kid opening, they have couple rubber bands,"
730.84,734.0, couple pieces of twine holding it together.
734.0,734.84, There's a big seam.
734.84,736.5200000000001," You see his hair coming out between, yeah."
736.5200000000001,738.32, He's like eating a caramel apple.
738.32,740.84," Like, almost the stitching a little bit."
740.84,743.24," But if you're like, if you're like a dude with an encephalitis,"
743.24,746.8000000000001," or you look like the guy from mask, you just spin that."
746.8000000000001,748.84," And then be like, I'm a black bar."
748.84,750.32," That's like, you're a big,"
750.32,753.32," and there's just one day of the year when you can look like,"
753.32,757.64, several costume opportunities exist for hide yourself a loyze.
757.64,760.24, You simply got to know where to look.
760.24,762.44, That's your one day of the year.
762.44,765.44, My common out party.
765.44,767.2, Happy Halloween kids.
767.2,768.44, It's my face.
768.44,770.44, Okay.
770.44,773.76, Do you have anything gaming related to talk about this week at all?
773.76,774.9200000000001," Yeah, I got one."
774.9200000000001,777.1600000000001," Is he related to games, kind of?"
777.1600000000001,778.0, Is he?
778.0,778.84, This is during the start.
778.84,779.56, It's a dreamcast.
779.56,781.52," Chris, I might have told you this story."
781.52,782.52, I don't know.
782.52,783.72, That's how I start all my story.
783.72,785.68," So I'll stop you when you've told it to me,"
785.68,787.96, and then you can just stop telling it.
787.96,790.12, That makes it a great rating.
790.12,792.0, So I did hear it.
792.0,796.4," At one point, when I was in grad school,"
796.4,800.4, I had a friend down from San Diego who was a mild roommate
800.4,802.2, and undergrad was staying over.
802.2,805.28, And one morning he wakes up and he goes over to my room
805.28,807.56," and wakes me up and says,"
807.56,811.0799999999999," hey, do you know some guy meets this description?"
811.0799999999999,812.52," I'm like, what are you talking about?"
812.52,813.3599999999999, Do you know what?
813.3599999999999,814.7199999999999, Leave me alone and go back to bed.
814.7199999999999,816.52," And like someone was just in here,"
816.52,819.0," he's like, standing above me."
819.0,820.88," And I asked him like, who are you?"
820.88,821.8, Do you know Shawn?
821.8,823.88," And they go, it's just like, yeah, I know."
823.88,827.0," And he's like, I just sent something was wrong."
827.0,829.3199999999999," So I told him, I don't think you should be here."
829.3199999999999,832.04," And then he just said, okay, and then he left."
832.04,834.88," So the setup is that this guy also,"
834.88,836.76," he was prone, this guy's Michael."
836.76,838.56, He was prone to waking hallucinations.
838.56,842.08, So now and then he'd wake up and think he
842.08,843.12, saw hallucinations.
843.12,847.64," Yeah, we're in the borderlands between sleep and wakefulness."
847.64,851.08," Like sometimes, certain people will have these odd,"
851.08,853.64," like, jarring transitions where they'll think they see"
853.64,857.28, themselves looking at them from the end of the bed.
857.28,859.92," Various, you know, neurosycologists and stuff"
859.92,861.64," have taken it back and through time and said,"
861.64,865.4399999999999," hey, maybe this is an explanation for some of the more archaic"
865.44,867.12, descriptions of people thinking that they're
867.12,869.12, demons sitting on their chest when they woke up
869.12,871.96, and making it difficult for them to breathe and whatnot.
871.96,873.6800000000001," So anyway, this is all important because I just"
873.6800000000001,874.2800000000001, dismissed it.
874.2800000000001,879.0," Ultimately, I'm like, you trip in Mike."
879.0,882.08," Until a week later, which would be Christmas,"
882.08,885.84," it was the night of Christmas Eve, I'm sleeping and I woke up."
885.84,886.8800000000001, I don't know why.
886.8800000000001,889.44," It was just kind of I woke up and I looked at my door,"
889.44,893.48," which was closed and beneath it, I saw a flash of light."
893.48,896.52, And it was just a very small single bedroom apartment
896.52,898.4, where there was the room and then right outside there
898.4,900.6800000000001," is the living room, which was the kitchen and everything"
900.6800000000001,902.32, all together and then there's bathroom next to it.
902.32,905.88," So I said, okay, whatever."
905.88,907.9200000000001," I'm just tripping off, I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
907.9200000000001,908.88, We can go back to bed.
908.88,911.08, So I go to the bathroom and I stand there and I turn around
911.08,912.28, and I'm going back to my room.
912.28,916.96," I see a silhouette of some fool, like standing in my living room."
916.96,920.8000000000001, And so then I just kind of pretended I didn't see him
920.8000000000001,922.84, and went back into my room and looked around for something.
922.84,924.64, I didn't have anything any kind of weapon.
924.64,929.6," So I just took a belt, I had and then connected the buckle"
929.6,931.76," and then let the rest hang on my hand so that I could,"
931.76,933.0400000000001," like, with the shit out of him with that,"
933.0400000000001,935.44, hit him in the face of the buckle and then
935.44,938.5600000000001, so I went out in the living room holding this thing.
938.5600000000001,941.24," And the guy was like, still there and I turned the light on."
941.24,944.0," And he's just there, I was like, what are you doing"
944.0,945.0, in my house?
945.0,946.44," But I was all pissed off, you know?"
946.44,947.44," I was like, total fine."
947.44,949.44, I was crazy looking guy.
949.44,950.44, I was crazy looking guy.
951.1600000000001,952.8000000000001," No, he was just was a dude."
952.8000000000001,954.24," He was wearing like a hoodie, you know,"
954.24,956.7600000000001," when you had his hands in his pocket, doing that kind of shit."
956.7600000000001,961.48," And the first thing he says, it's okay."
961.48,963.84, I've been sent here to protect you.
963.84,966.4000000000001," And then I look, as he says,"
966.4000000000001,967.7600000000001," is I'm looking around and I see,"
967.7600000000001,970.5200000000001, and here's this is why we're talking about games now.
970.5200000000001,972.0, You have my dream test going.
972.0,975.1600000000001," My dream test and my dream test games are all lined up,"
975.1600000000001,976.72, with my checkbook and my wallet.
976.72,979.72, They're all lined up on my coffee table.
979.72,981.6, And there's like a bag near him.
981.6,985.6," He's sitting there and I'm like, dude, okay, seriously."
985.6,987.64," Like, I mean, I'm like, I called the cops."
987.64,989.76," I didn't really, of course, my phone was on the living room."
989.76,991.4, I didn't even have a cell phone at the time.
991.4,994.28," He's like, just remember, I've been sent here to protect you."
994.28,997.12," And so he was really, he was really great at it."
997.12,1000.08, Because I came out of the room ready to immediately
1000.08,1000.9200000000001, just start fighting.
1000.9200000000001,1003.1600000000001," And I knew him like, hey, I'm probably about to get"
1003.1600000000001,1005.24," stad or shot now, but I'm not going to go in my room"
1005.24,1007.2, and pretend that this shit's not happening.
1007.2,1008.64," So I went out there, ready to do that."
1008.64,1011.3199999999999," Immediately caught me off guard long enough to ask myself,"
1011.3199999999999,1013.6, what the hell reminds words.
1013.6,1017.12," And so, so then, yeah, anyway, basically,"
1017.12,1018.0, it just was super awkward.
1018.0,1021.48," And he kept saying, just remember, you were unheard."
1021.48,1023.6," Just remember, you hadn't been hurt."
1023.6,1025.68," Like, weird in you window, you know?"
1025.68,1027.72," Like, hey, I had the chance that when you were asleep,"
1027.72,1029.44, maybe I could have gotten there and checked you or something.
1029.44,1031.2," Was there some, was there an acknowledgement here"
1031.2,1032.92, that a robbery was in place?
1032.92,1035.48," Other than that, yeah, I was like other than I'm sitting there"
1035.48,1037.32, like brandishing the belt thing.
1037.32,1039.08, And he's kind of doing the hands in the pockets
1039.08,1040.8799999999999, like it's made in a web and gun.
1040.8799999999999,1041.8799999999999," Right, you know?"
1041.8799999999999,1044.4399999999998," And then eventually, it was just the most bizarre thing."
1044.4399999999998,1046.52, I'm sure it probably just happened in 30 seconds.
1046.52,1049.28," You know, and he says, okay, I'm going to grab my comic"
1049.28,1051.3999999999999, cosy sack and just slip out.
1051.3999999999999,1054.24," Remember, I'm here protecting you."
1054.24,1055.08," It's like, maybe did."
1055.08,1057.24," I was like, all right, I didn't even grab this,"
1057.24,1060.08," he grabbed this bag, you know, and then went and immediately,"
1060.08,1061.28, did he scoop up your stuff?
1061.28,1062.12," No, he didn't."
1062.12,1062.96, So he didn't know.
1062.96,1065.08, And I went back to the fighting mode.
1065.08,1067.08," At that point, I was like, okay,"
1067.08,1069.32," you can leave and then I'll work about catching you later,"
1069.32,1071.6399999999999," but I'm like, I still don't know what he had"
1071.6399999999999,1073.56," because he was doing that with both hands,"
1073.56,1076.8799999999999," like playing very much like, you know, I don't know what you got."
1076.8799999999999,1078.6799999999998," And I'm like, and also, if someone's crazy enough"
1078.6799999999998,1082.1999999999998," to break in your fucking place twice to come in your place twice,"
1082.1999999999998,1084.6799999999998," I mean, obviously, you're not talking about, like,"
1084.6799999999998,1086.96," hey, the old, like, let's meet in the playground and Tesla,"
1086.96,1088.36," you're talking about, you know,"
1088.36,1090.8, pretty much a fight to the death or incapacitation.
1090.8,1092.96," So I was like, hey, I got that dream."
1092.96,1093.8, I got that dream.
1093.8,1094.6399999999999," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1094.6399999999999,1095.6399999999999," But anyway, yeah, that was,"
1096.6000000000001,1098.3200000000002, and it turned out he had the key to the place
1098.3200000000002,1100.0400000000002, because that's why they're here and somehow
1100.0400000000002,1101.0400000000002, had the key to it.
1101.0400000000002,1102.6000000000001," And so, how do you have a key?"
1102.6000000000001,1103.76, You freak me out for a long time.
1103.76,1105.4, I put a bunch of wind charms on the door.
1105.4,1106.24, It's a wake-up.
1106.24,1108.76," And then, got a, not only is it good protection,"
1108.76,1109.88, but they sound nice.
1109.88,1110.4, Yeah.
1110.4,1111.96, Everyone's trying to keep me in.
1111.96,1113.64," And then you go back to work and everyone, of course,"
1113.64,1115.48," you hear, you know, when I was in grad school,"
1115.48,1116.6000000000001," and I also worked at the grocery store,"
1116.6000000000001,1119.24," everyone's grocery side's like, oh, man,"
1119.24,1120.92, I would have blown that motherfucker's head off.
1120.92,1121.6000000000001, You did it to me.
1121.6000000000001,1124.2," And like, yeah, and you got to hear that all month long."
1124.2,1126.3600000000001," And they're like, well, too bad I didn't have a gun to do it"
1126.3600000000001,1126.88," with, huh?"
1126.88,1128.4," And they, well, that's why we got to get you on."
1128.4,1131.24," And it's like, so instead, I bought a,"
1131.24,1134.32, I bought a base glue like an entrenching tool.
1134.32,1137.44," And I had that right, right on my bed."
1137.44,1138.28, And you did it.
1138.28,1140.2, Like an ingestar and like a machete.
1140.2,1141.2, Yeah.
1141.2,1143.0, My version of the story would have been bald going back
1143.0,1144.48," to the room staying there,"
1144.48,1146.2, clutching my tenants and insurance policy
1146.2,1147.2, and at my point in it.
1147.2,1151.72," It's the second story, too, is I couldn't go in there."
1151.72,1154.16, Pardon me while I take some photos of my properties.
1154.6000000000001,1155.0, Yeah.
1155.0,1156.52, So it's a topic.
1156.52,1159.16, Has anyone ever tried to gain your games?
1159.16,1160.96, Ha ha ha.
1160.96,1162.0," Yeah, it was just so cool."
1162.0,1164.24, It was just something you can ever find out what the deal
1164.24,1165.3600000000001, will ever caught on or anything.
1165.3600000000001,1166.2, Please don't care.
1166.2,1167.8000000000002, It's so weird.
1167.8000000000002,1171.3600000000001," And it was like, because I moved to, I was moving from Seattle"
1171.3600000000001,1173.48," to Bellingham, Washington, which was up in the Canadian border"
1173.48,1174.4, toward Vancouver.
1174.4,1178.2," And I was like, I'll just look in the paper, or whatever."
1178.2,1179.96, I don't need to go out and check anything out there.
1179.96,1180.8000000000002, It's belling him.
1180.8000000000002,1182.6000000000001, What how bad can it possibly be?
1182.6,1185.1599999999999, And so I ended up there actually was a slow-married there.
1185.1599999999999,1188.4399999999998, And I ended up signing up for a year lease with this place
1188.4399999999998,1191.48, in it where there was just been a drive by like six months
1191.48,1192.76, before.
1192.76,1194.4399999999998, There was like no lighting or anything.
1194.4399999999998,1196.0, Just straight cats everywhere.
1196.0,1199.28, And that was like the most polite relaxing robbery
1199.28,1200.8799999999999, that ever had very much was.
1200.8799999999999,1202.28, It was very protective.
1202.28,1204.28, He thought it was going to be like a superhero story.
1204.28,1206.9599999999998, That's what I was family like to me.
1206.9599999999998,1210.32, He was like a hero sort of guy.
1210.32,1211.6399999999999, You know?
1211.64,1214.2, He wasn't like the mutants had come in the try to steal your shit
1214.2,1215.3600000000001, and he was there saving it.
1215.3600000000001,1216.5600000000002, So what did he take?
1216.5600000000002,1218.2800000000002, He didn't take anything.
1218.2800000000002,1219.1200000000001, Maybe he was there.
1219.1200000000001,1220.2800000000002, He was just lining it.
1220.2800000000002,1223.92, That's how a lot of criminals they could crum burglars or whatever.
1223.92,1226.5200000000002," The lace stuff out like Sean, you were saying, you were burglars."
1226.5200000000002,1228.88, Why don't you're bargling about lining the shit?
1228.88,1229.88, Why don't you last the turf?
1229.88,1231.4, Was he like an OCD criminal?
1231.4,1233.68, Why is he lining it all up?
1233.68,1234.96, Just shove it into the band.
1234.96,1236.3600000000001, We were our houses broken into.
1236.3600000000001,1238.88, And you didn't see the guy do it when we got home.
1238.88,1242.68, We were our stereo equipment and all our CDs were perfectly lined up on the floor.
1242.68,1244.68," Like, oh, look at all the part and laid it all out."
1244.68,1245.5200000000002, That's so freaky.
1245.5200000000002,1248.6000000000001, They left with our jewel cases but not the CDs.
1248.6000000000001,1251.1200000000001, And our two Atari links is.
1251.1200000000001,1254.1200000000001, That's what we had won.
1254.1200000000001,1255.1200000000001, Me and my brother were your chatting with.
1255.1200000000001,1257.3200000000002, We had two of them so we could link them up and play.
1257.3200000000002,1259.3200000000002, He's a wonderful football together or whatever.
1259.3200000000002,1260.5600000000002," Oh, that's amazing."
1260.5600000000002,1264.6000000000001, The Atari links is almost as big as the the 8800 GTX.
1264.6000000000001,1265.6000000000001, That was amazing.
1265.6000000000001,1266.96, There's a giant machine.
1266.96,1268.6000000000001, I loved it.
1268.6399999999999,1269.4399999999998, Wow.
1269.4399999999998,1270.24, I've never heard of this.
1270.24,1271.8, The crooks lining the stuff up.
1271.8,1273.1599999999999, It was really cool.
1273.1599999999999,1273.84, Might be the same.
1273.84,1275.04, I'm not reading a right crime man.
1275.04,1275.6399999999999, Maybe the same one.
1275.6399999999999,1276.84," Yeah, I'm a same guy."
1276.84,1277.36, Yeah.
1277.36,1280.1999999999998, Barthere was our grandmother who lives up upstairs.
1280.1999999999998,1282.6, I started coming down the stairs so they jetted.
1282.6,1282.8, Yeah.
1282.8,1286.08," Otherwise, why would you just take the jewel cases and leave this"
1286.08,1286.8, stereo equipment like that?
1286.8,1287.32, I don't know if it was.
1287.32,1287.84, Yeah.
1287.84,1288.36, Yeah.
1288.36,1289.1599999999999, Did you say they didn't.
1289.1599999999999,1291.1599999999999, They took the jewel cases but not the CDs.
1291.1599999999999,1291.84, Right.
1291.84,1294.32, So they took the CDs out of the jewel cases.
1294.32,1295.32, Yes.
1295.32,1296.7199999999998, They stole blank jewel cases.
1296.7199999999998,1297.7199999999998, Yes.
1298.6799999999998,1299.84, They can come here.
1299.84,1300.84, Yeah.
1300.84,1303.6," I have W because we got like 8,000 of those."
1303.6,1305.08, I don't know what we're doing.
1305.08,1306.0, Maybe they were.
1306.0,1307.24, I really have no idea.
1307.24,1308.04, It was just clearly.
1308.04,1310.48, Apparently it was all to protect Sean.
1310.48,1311.48, Yeah.
1311.48,1313.6799999999998, Then there's protecting Sean at this day that he'd stand
1313.6799999999998,1315.48, and outside Sean's apartment.
1315.48,1317.0, I'm going to protect you.
1317.0,1318.84," When there was only one set of footprints, Sean."
1318.84,1319.84, Yeah.
1319.84,1326.84, I never had any games stolen and I'm not really proud of this.
1326.84,1331.9599999999998," But a long time ago in a bookstore, I really wanted the Epic's Fast Load"
1331.9599999999998,1333.76, Carriage for my Commodore 64.
1333.76,1336.0, And it was just sitting in a big bin of games.
1336.0,1337.0," It was like, I don't know."
1337.0,1338.9599999999998, It was like 20 bucks.
1338.9599999999998,1340.1599999999999, Nice to stood there for a while.
1340.1599999999999,1341.36, Like around the store was really busy.
1341.36,1342.6, I stood there for a while.
1342.6,1343.6, Had my bag ready.
1343.6,1346.6," I kept checking, these old stores had mirrors in the corners."
1346.6,1347.6, Like the wrapper on mirrors.
1347.6,1350.0, And I was probably cameras behind those.
1350.0,1351.32, So I kind of had my back to them.
1351.32,1352.9599999999998," And finally, I dropped it in my bag."
1352.9599999999998,1355.24, And I was there with my friend Mike who had a motorcycle.
1355.24,1357.44," And he was like, I said, Mike, I got it."
1357.44,1358.44, Let's go.
1358.44,1362.8," So he was like out of the bookstore across the mall through this, we had this mall"
1362.8,1363.8, all figured out.
1363.8,1366.2," And we went through the, there was kind of a right-aid there."
1366.2,1368.6," We went through their back door, where his motorcycle was."
1368.6,1372.16," And man, I was so sure that, like, mall security was right behind me."
1372.16,1374.88," And we just hopped in his motorcycle and got the, got the, how are they?"
1374.88,1375.88, You got away?
1375.88,1376.88," Oh, yeah."
1376.88,1377.88, How old were you?
1377.88,1379.88, I was early teens.
1379.88,1380.88, Okay.
1380.88,1382.8, I was actually caught shoplifting at about a month later.
1382.8,1384.16, So that was kind of the end of my-
1384.16,1385.16, Through that time's crew.
1385.16,1386.16, Wow.
1386.16,1388.44, So have you ever admitted the story before in public?
1388.44,1390.16, This whole crime spray yours.
1390.16,1391.16, I don't think so.
1391.16,1392.16, Yeah.
1392.16,1394.16," I think the statute of limitations is probably, it's my idea."
1394.16,1397.16, It's stealing an epic fast load cartridge.
1397.16,1398.16, That was good.
1398.16,1400.16," It was, it was well enjoyed Ilgon games though."
1400.16,1401.16, I did that too.
1401.16,1402.16, Yeah.
1402.16,1406.16," I shoplifted, uh, I stole, uh, Kansas record."
1406.16,1407.16, Yeah.
1407.16,1408.16," It would, okay."
1408.16,1409.16, So the joke was on me.
1409.16,1411.16, I took it home and I had to listen to Kansas.
1411.16,1413.16," I was like, carry on."
1413.16,1414.16, I have to go to New Wins.
1414.16,1415.16, Fuck!
1415.16,1416.16," I got, I stole this."
1416.16,1417.16, I got caught.
1417.16,1420.16, And had to go to Juvenile Hall for stealing two settapes.
1420.16,1423.16," Well, now we can see the common thread amongst gaming asses."
1423.16,1424.16, Here's this story.
1424.16,1428.16," You got to listen to yours, but mine, it was at Tower Records."
1428.16,1431.16," And I went with this kid who, like, it was the same brother as Jason and Shane."
1431.16,1434.16, I talked to you a little bit about them before about one of them's shady underpants.
1434.16,1435.16, We found back right.
1435.16,1436.16, Okay.
1436.16,1437.16, That's not a podcast.
1437.16,1438.16, I didn't.
1438.16,1440.16," So when we got busted, the dragon's back in to security."
1440.16,1443.16," The guy's like, well, let's see what you guys, let's see what your kids have."
1443.16,1444.16, And he pulled out from me.
1444.16,1446.16," He's like, Sonic Youth, goo."
1446.16,1447.16, Happy Monday's bummer.
1447.16,1450.16," He's like, that describes a stature in no-hum."
1450.16,1451.16, He said that.
1451.16,1452.16, Yeah.
1452.16,1454.16," And then he's like, what a fuck."
1454.16,1455.16, This is copying.
1455.16,1458.16," And then he post, no, this was like the guy that worked there."
1458.16,1459.16, And then he post up my friends.
1459.16,1461.16," He's like, step up."
1461.16,1462.16, Chura.
1462.16,1466.16," He's like, dude, you're going, you're, you're, you're getting arrested for stealing this shit."
1466.16,1468.16," He was like, holy clowning on him."
1468.16,1471.16, But his dad was there to come pick him up.
1471.16,1472.16, So he didn't have to go anywhere.
1472.16,1474.16, And my parents were away for the weekend.
1474.16,1477.16, So I got to go to JVK.
1477.16,1478.16, Wow.
1478.16,1480.16," But you do the thing I think everyone who gets caught does just like, pay for it."
1480.16,1481.16, I'll pay for it.
1481.16,1482.16, I got the money.
1482.16,1484.16," And I was like, I didn't do that with seeing."
1484.16,1485.16, I was trying about doing this.
1485.16,1486.16, But that's going to kill me.
1486.16,1487.16," Oh, yeah."
1487.16,1488.16, I was pretty.
1488.16,1489.16, I didn't do it with the campus.
1489.16,1492.16, Because it wasn't worth the $3.99 records cost back then.
1492.16,1494.16, I'm just still a regular word that the first one.
1494.16,1496.16," You go in five, actually."
1496.16,1498.16, Let me preface this with kids.
1498.16,1499.16, Don't actually do this.
1499.16,1500.16, Right.
1500.16,1501.16, Right.
1501.16,1502.16," Needless to say, I learned my lesson."
1502.16,1503.16, Crime doesn't pay.
1503.16,1504.16, Idiotic.
1504.16,1510.16, But what we did though was we brought in a bag from that store from record.
1510.16,1512.16, We had actually bought in the past.
1512.16,1516.16," So we are holding a bag from music plus, which was in the name of the store."
1516.16,1517.16, With records in it.
1517.16,1519.16, And then we just slipped the new one.
1519.16,1521.16, He just got the two for one deal.
1521.16,1522.16, Basically.
1522.16,1523.16, Yeah.
1523.16,1524.16, We didn't get caught though.
1524.16,1527.16, We took a Tom and then had a Kansas record.
1527.16,1528.16, So.
1528.16,1529.16," Oh, learn."
1529.16,1531.16, Some learned right there.
1531.16,1532.16, Crime doesn't pay.
1532.16,1533.16, Take it off.
1533.16,1534.16, They saw you on the cameras.
1534.16,1535.16," They're like, let them go."
1535.16,1536.16, Yeah.
1536.16,1537.16, Before we.
1537.16,1538.16, Don't figure it out.
1538.16,1539.16, We had an Islamic.
1539.16,1540.16, This is a worse than stealing.
1540.16,1542.16," Went to like, it wasn't."
1542.16,1544.16, It's one of the stores where it's not quite a thrift store.
1544.16,1546.16, But it's like liquidated stuff.
1546.16,1547.16," You know, like they have grocery outlet."
1547.16,1549.16, And it's the grocery version called Gross Out.
1549.16,1552.16, But they have one for like other non perishable thing.
1552.16,1553.16, We went there.
1553.16,1556.16, And we're changing the stickers.
1556.16,1559.16," So like, you know, you just put, which is the same stealing."
1559.16,1560.16, Right.
1560.16,1561.16, But it's like we just put like a sticker.
1561.16,1563.16, It's like 15 cents on all the stuff.
1563.16,1566.16, And the part of the thing there is that the clerks were.
1566.16,1569.16, Special needs might be a.
1569.16,1570.16, Haltick waves.
1570.16,1571.16, Very nice.
1571.16,1572.16, Yeah.
1572.16,1574.16, And so we're going through the counter.
1574.16,1576.16, Persona with is like.
1576.16,1578.16," They're just like, oh, man."
1578.16,1579.16, It's so cheap here.
1579.16,1580.16, I love it.
1580.16,1581.16, And the clerks like.
1581.16,1582.16, Yeah.
1582.16,1584.16," And the other thing is, it's like, it's so cheap."
1584.16,1586.16, It's almost like stealing.
1586.16,1587.16," Oh, man."
1587.16,1588.16, Man.
1588.16,1591.16, You can't stealing and mocking the people you're stealing from.
1591.16,1592.16, You feel about that.
1592.16,1593.16, I feel good.
1593.16,1594.16, I feel what it's a bad.
1594.16,1596.16, What a karma due to him later.
1596.16,1597.16," Yeah, really."
1597.16,1600.16, I think we all need to go do some volunteer work on this podcast.
1600.16,1601.16, There were.
1601.16,1602.16, Yeah.
1602.16,1603.16, Deal.
1603.16,1604.16, I want more records sort of thing that doesn't involve stealing.
1604.16,1605.16, But it involves getting.
1605.16,1609.16," But it gets it involves getting made fun of by the clerks, which is."
1609.16,1610.16, I had this friend.
1611.16,1613.16, And he was super into kiss.
1613.16,1617.16," And at the time kiss was, you know, they hadn't ever taken their makeup off yet."
1617.16,1618.16, Right.
1618.16,1621.16, Now that we all know what they look like and they're all old that anyway.
1621.16,1625.16," But at the time, they were cool and they were the guys in the mass."
1625.16,1630.16," And so my friend was in the kiss army, which he had to like mail away for and he got a little sticker and all that stuff."
1630.16,1632.16, I wasn't in the kiss army because I didn't like his.
1632.16,1633.16, But he was.
1633.16,1636.16, And the new kiss album was going to come out any day now with love gun.
1636.16,1637.16, It was a name of the record.
1638.16,1641.16," And my friend was just dying for love gun to come out and, you know."
1643.16,1648.16," And so he went into the record so after school one day and, you know, we didn't."
1648.16,1651.16," It was back pre-internet, you know, you didn't know when shit was coming out, whatever."
1651.16,1655.16," So he goes up to the car and he says, hey, can you tell me when love gun's coming out?"
1655.16,1657.16," And the, yeah."
1657.16,1659.16," The clerk goes, who gives her shit?"
1659.16,1662.16, That's a whole story.
1662.16,1664.16, I never forgot it because I was this last from my friend's face.
1664.16,1666.16," Like, oh yeah."
1666.16,1669.16, The guy who's going to make money off it doesn't even care.
1669.16,1671.16, That's how lame your band is.
1673.16,1676.16," His jeans, him is tongue will stab your twat for a bag of pot."
1679.16,1681.16, Have we talked about games yet?
1681.16,1682.16, That's one of the things you put.
1682.16,1683.16," Yes, that was right about."
1683.16,1684.16, There've been orbiting our country.
1684.16,1687.16, We've been orbiting game Dreamcast and epic fast.
1687.16,1688.16," Oh, my, true."
1688.16,1691.16," You guys, given, have you guys given up on Team Fortress 2?"
1691.16,1692.16," Chris, but are you playing it at all?"
1692.16,1695.16," It was pretty fucked up on, on the 360."
1695.16,1698.16," For all, they just fixed it last weekend, but I haven't played it since."
1698.16,1700.16, I'm actually playing back through episode 2.
1700.16,1704.16, And a lot of guys in each GM are playing through a half-life 2 for the first time.
1704.16,1705.16," Oh, wow."
1705.16,1707.16," And the same complaining, comparing is it just starts so slow."
1707.16,1708.16, Right.
1708.16,1709.16," Which, yeah."
1709.16,1710.16, I guess it did.
1710.16,1711.16, I don't remember.
1711.16,1715.16, I actually spawned a feature idea that I want to do about like that first half hour of a game.
1715.16,1718.16," Like, there are other games that started slow and get better, like, on the consoles."
1718.16,1719.16," Like, resistance."
1719.16,1724.16," I guess I can see that, especially if you're coming from a console background and you didn't play half-life one."
1724.16,1725.16, Yeah.
1725.16,1731.16," That maybe that, you know, where we were all giving it the better for the dad because we knew Valve and we knew Half-Life 1."
1731.16,1732.16, Right.
1732.16,1735.16, I think we were probably more patient because we knew what was coming.
1735.16,1736.16, Yeah.
1736.16,1737.16, And we're just sure we have no clue.
1737.16,1738.16, It's delicious.
1738.16,1743.16," Well, I even told them like, well, Brian, who's our previous editor, he's finally got two of"
1743.16,1744.16, power.
1744.16,1745.16, It's going to get me's really liking it.
1745.16,1749.16," But Michael, our news editor, still, like, it's so slow and I'm like, you know what?"
1749.16,1751.16," But is that Donna, how are you talking about?"
1751.16,1752.16, Yeah.
1752.16,1753.16, I just told them to skip the episode.
1753.16,1755.16," So guys, he's like, he's not really up on the story anyway."
1755.16,1756.16, Yeah.
1756.16,1758.16, And episode two is so good to episode two.
1758.16,1761.16," To me, it's my favorite of all the Half-Life."
1761.16,1762.16, Yeah.
1762.16,1764.16, When it depends what they're talking about by slow.
1764.16,1767.16," Like, I think that the boat ride was like way overly long."
1767.16,1768.16, Right.
1768.16,1769.16, Slow.
1769.16,1772.16," But if you're talking about when you first come in and you get off the train and you're in the train station,"
1772.16,1778.16," the interrogation room scene, your first look at the city square and, you know, the Orwellian broadcasts and"
1778.16,1781.16," system, guys being beaten down, your first trip to the tenements."
1781.16,1785.16," So, it's very, like, sure, you're not like blast in the shit out of anything."
1785.16,1786.16, Yeah.
1786.16,1788.16," And the, the pacing is, is tone down."
1788.16,1791.16," But that, those are like completely incredible moments of that."
1791.16,1792.16, Right.
1792.16,1798.16," But if he's, so they're talking about that, which I'm inclined to think that Donna, who is probably very much means that."
1798.16,1799.16, Do you know how far he is?
1799.16,1801.16," Like, do you know what he's talking about?"
1801.16,1802.16, Complaining about his being slow.
1802.16,1805.16, He hasn't even gotten to the Swan Buggy part yet.
1805.16,1806.16, So it's.
1806.16,1808.16, So he doesn't even know from slow.
1808.16,1809.16, You think that's boring.
1809.16,1811.16," You just like Donna, huh?"
1811.16,1813.16, That's what we're all about here in PCG.
1813.16,1814.16, Yeah.
1814.16,1815.16, But I'm a little bit much about games.
1815.16,1816.16, I like pacing.
1816.16,1822.16," And even console games, games in general are built to deliver, you know, the bigger and more rewarding."
1822.16,1823.16, Experiences go along.
1823.16,1826.16," It's kind of like, what's around the next corner, what's the next level?"
1826.16,1827.16, Yeah.
1827.16,1832.16," So it's, I don't think it's anything unique that, you know, it's certain that, like, half life."
1832.16,1833.16, Do you start off.
1833.16,1835.16," So I don't think it's, I don't really remember thinking it started off slow."
1835.16,1836.16, So.
1836.16,1837.16, And then such pay.
1837.16,1839.16, It's like it's establishes.
1839.16,1844.16," I mean, I'm defending it, but because I'm very, you know, passionately supportive of the approach they took for the beginning."
1844.16,1845.16, Right.
1845.16,1847.16," But that and that's that like, you start the game."
1847.16,1849.16, The first thing you see is the citadel.
1849.16,1850.16, And you're going to see that.
1850.16,1851.16, It's going to frame your experience.
1851.16,1854.16, The entire time you play the game and you're ultimately going to end up there.
1854.16,1856.16," Something very, very few games ever do."
1856.16,1857.16, Yeah.
1857.16,1858.16, I've shot that at two.
1858.16,1859.16, It's like introducing it a rapture.
1859.16,1861.16, And it's starting to introduce you to these powers.
1861.16,1862.16, Right.
1862.16,1863.16, Yeah.
1863.16,1865.16," And then like here, here's the tone."
1865.16,1866.16, Here's the world that you're inhabiting.
1866.16,1872.16," And it's, it can be, and because you just appeared in it, your character in the same fashion that as the player you just appeared in it."
1872.16,1876.16," Again, like in by a shot where, you know, this is your introduction to this world."
1876.16,1880.16," It's, you have a set of establishing, you know, the scene and all the stuff."
1880.16,1884.16," And it's so much fun to just to look at, you know, I mean, when someone,"
1884.16,1890.16," I mean, in the interaction one, one of the Metro police says, hey, knocks a can off the trash and says, pick that up and throw it in there."
1890.16,1891.16, Yeah.
1891.16,1893.16," And even that moment where you're like, I just, I'm so, I'm so, I'm a bitch."
1893.16,1895.16," I just started this game and I'm so, I'm so, I'm a bitch."
1895.16,1898.16," Like, no, what do how many other shooters do that?"
1898.16,1903.16," And they even care where, instead of you just, you come in, you blow heads off and you come out, blow and heads off."
1903.16,1906.16," You know, I mean, there are actual changes in, in your level of empowerment."
1906.16,1909.16," And of course, it flips it and at the end, you're ultimately empowered."
1909.16,1911.16," And then a lot of people complain about that, too."
1911.16,1913.16," Don't ask, well, so easy."
1913.16,1914.16, It's supposed to be a boss.
1914.16,1916.16, It takes two hours of play.
1916.16,1919.16," Well, but this seems like the concept of the boss is almost going away."
1919.16,1924.16, I'm a lot of games because it'll just be a combination of all the game play that you've learned throughout the game coming right.
1924.16,1926.16, And like a challenge to something.
1926.16,1928.16," But I mean, no one on each game is giving up on the game."
1928.16,1931.16," I just think, and I know you guys have talked about these games."
1931.16,1933.16, And then you talk about Halo to death.
1933.16,1939.16," But I think I just recently beat Halo 3 and by the end of it, I was so sick fighting the flood, which, yeah."
1939.16,1942.16," I think, that was like turning me off to the game."
1942.16,1945.16," I think it might be the problem with some people in half life,"
1945.16,1950.16," to the beginning is that they don't realize that when you get to like Raven home or something,"
1950.16,1952.16, you're suddenly in like a very different game.
1952.16,1953.16, Right.
1953.16,1954.16, Yeah.
1954.16,1957.16," There's all these turns where you're just like, and now we're going to do something completely different with the FPS genre."
1957.16,1958.16, And maybe they don't.
1958.16,1964.16, Maybe they think the whole game is going to be what they're experiencing in that first of many hours that is.
1964.16,1965.16, Right.
1965.16,1966.16," I mean, Valve never does the thing."
1966.16,1972.16," I can't even think in episode one or two, they do it either of like starting you off in the middle of action."
1972.16,1973.16, Like they ramp it up.
1973.16,1974.16, Like some games do.
1974.16,1975.16, Yeah.
1975.16,1977.16, They put you into the middle of a fight right away and then ramp it down.
1977.16,1979.16, Just classic storytelling technique.
1979.16,1981.16, But I don't think Half Life has ever done that.
1981.16,1984.16, They always put a gradual build.
1984.16,1985.16, Yeah.
1985.16,1986.16, I just think.
1986.16,1991.16, The exception of episode one does in the sense that it's kind of like the place is going to blow.
1991.16,1996.16, Like it's it's kind of like the equivalent of starting Metroid at the when the timer's running.
1996.16,1997.16, It's up to no timer.
1997.16,1998.16, Right.
1998.16,2004.16," But this is the thing is a more in the consoles again, but role playing games, especially the Japanese role playing games,"
2004.16,2005.16, just start so slow.
2005.16,2006.16, Yeah.
2006.16,2010.16, And that's the thing that's kind of turned me off more and more to that genre now that I don't.
2010.16,2013.16, I don't get just one game a year.
2013.16,2021.16, But the fact like there was a game blue dragon that came out for the 360 from the guy made Final Fantasy had the most boring like first half hour.
2021.16,2027.16," And then there was another highly critical hit, O'Kami that had like a wolf and had this cool water color."
2027.16,2029.16, That was like first of hours was tutorials.
2029.16,2030.16, So yeah.
2030.16,2031.16, And then it gets good.
2031.16,2032.16, And it's like these games that just start.
2032.16,2036.16," Well, that game was interesting because it was so unusual too."
2036.16,2039.16," I mean, like he almost they almost had to teach you how to play that."
2039.16,2040.16, Yeah.
2040.16,2041.16, Yeah.
2041.16,2043.16," But it's like, you know, he's sitting there and you watch text scroll for a while."
2043.16,2044.16, Yeah.
2044.16,2045.16, Yeah.
2045.16,2046.16, That scrolls never a good thing.
2046.16,2047.16, No.
2047.16,2049.16," How you start an end and it's very important, you know, and like to solve the other meaning."
2049.16,2052.16," Well, Ryan let me, uh, Metal Girl Solid 1 for the first time."
2052.16,2055.16, And I have to say Metal Girl Gear Solid version.
2055.16,2057.16, This I've totally missed a series.
2057.16,2060.16," So he gave you gave you gave me that Nintendo the Gamecube edition, right?"
2060.16,2061.16, Mm-hmm.
2061.16,2062.16, And you're having the same problem that I could.
2062.16,2065.16, I can't get out of the first fucking room.
2065.16,2068.16, I feel like a complete loser because I can't.
2068.16,2070.16, Because you get thrown into this.
2070.16,2074.16," Uh, and I'm sure many people in the podcast probably all you guys are on the table here"
2074.16,2075.16," of PlayDum, but I haven't."
2075.16,2076.16, Mm-hmm.
2076.16,2080.16," So, you know, you're just putting to the room with like a few enemies."
2080.16,2084.16, And there is no tutorial at all on the stealth mechanic.
2084.16,2087.16, And all you have to do is get from one end of the room to the other where the elevator is.
2087.16,2088.16, Right.
2088.16,2090.16," And for the life of me, I can't do it without dying."
2090.16,2095.16," You know, I've, I've, I've started and Ryan, you told me not to feel too bad about this, right?"
2095.16,2099.16," I mean, it's like they, they introduce you just so many different, you know, you got to know."
2099.16,2101.16, Not to use your gun.
2101.16,2104.16," You got to know how to, you know, sneak up behind the guys and choke them."
2104.16,2106.16, You got to know how to like tap on stuff to get there to the chair.
2106.16,2107.16, It's a read the app.
2107.16,2109.16, And none of this is the right order.
2109.16,2113.16," And there's no moment in the game that we're used to now where, where they walk you through it."
2113.16,2114.16, They baby through it.
2114.16,2115.16, Yeah.
2115.16,2120.16," And that's a series, too, that started off like that, but was enormously successful in popular."
2120.16,2124.16, But only got more and more complicated and complicated to the point where you're holding
2124.16,2127.16," the controller like Gilbert is great, or whatever."
2127.16,2131.16, Trying to push all these buttons just to look on the camera machine gun and shoot.
2131.16,2137.16," And that's one thing they're doing with the new Metal Gear Solid is they're taking it way back and making it more, you know."
2137.16,2141.16, So you don't got to like do five different steps to get rid of a bullet anymore.
2141.16,2144.16," You might, so that's what I haven't actually played it, but guys I'm going to my staff."
2144.16,2151.16," I actually even though I, I was sucking at it, I, I kind of, it's not that I admired it, but it made me think like, wow."
2151.16,2160.16," This is definitely a change in in game design that in the old days they threw you in and you didn't get your, you know, half an hour, you know."
2160.16,2165.16," Now let's see if you can duck, you know, congratulations, soldier, you duck."
2165.16,2168.16," You know, now they just, in those days, you're just good luck to you, man."
2168.16,2169.16, Here's the game.
2169.16,2170.16, Right.
2170.16,2172.16," You're trying to use your gun, right?"
2172.16,2173.16, You're trying to shoot them.
2173.16,2177.16," Yeah, I was just, you know, guys, we're attacking me, so I shot them."
2177.16,2181.16, And then you're fucked if you ran into the game from Blackbuster because they didn't have the instructions.
2181.16,2184.16, They would have those like the instruction card printed on the back.
2184.16,2185.16, Yeah.
2185.16,2188.16," It was like, wasn't even, it was written who knows where to, if you produce it on it."
2188.16,2189.16, Yeah.
2189.16,2191.16," See, I got, Army has invaded."
2191.16,2193.16, Just make up their own story.
2193.16,2197.16," Speaking of pro tips, the reason I brought up team fortress is because a lot of people,"
2197.16,2203.16," but I want to see if you guys are still planning on because a lot of people been asking for more, more,"
2203.16,2204.16, or tips.
2204.16,2205.16, Yeah.
2205.16,2206.16, I want those produce.
2206.16,2209.16," The game's going to start a team, so we wouldn't need pro tips."
2209.16,2210.16, Okay.
2210.16,2211.16, One thing to know.
2211.16,2218.16," Play the PC is increasingly, I'm having the same, where everyone is like now, you know, after"
2218.16,2223.16," bring them up, so people that play the GFW radio drinking game get ready to, after your glass."
2223.16,2229.16," When I play the game with Rory, he gets upset, increasing it and he wants to go play, you know,"
2229.16,2230.16, opposing front or something.
2230.16,2235.16," And I start to figure out what's wrong is that normally we're really competitive about who's got the higher score,"
2235.16,2241.16," even if it's on our own team, you know, and the banana riders, which is, you know, the phenomena of,"
2241.16,2247.16," like, medics that are eager to please are giving me a serious advantage over him, so that's the medics, man."
2247.16,2248.16," No, I love them."
2248.16,2249.16, Here's the thing.
2249.16,2254.16," Here's my newfound appreciation of them, but the medics are, this is, again, this is just me."
2254.16,2259.16," Don't, so I say, Rory things and just don't take it their own way, but like, they're the prison yard"
2259.16,2260.16, bitches of team fortress.
2260.16,2262.16," And here's why, there's something that's like being prison."
2262.16,2265.16," There's something, no, no, and it's wonderful because we're all in that prison, right?"
2265.16,2269.16," But they're, like, you want to carry their favor."
2269.16,2271.16," You're like, I kind of pack a smokes for you, dude."
2271.16,2273.16," And like, or I'll protect you."
2273.16,2276.16," I'll make sure that like, you know, when, when, when, when, whereas comes through tonight,"
2276.16,2280.16, he's not going to try to smoke and hit you with the rocket.
2280.16,2284.16," I'm going to protect you, and I'm going to give you a pack of smokes, right?"
2284.16,2288.16," And you're going to like, follow me around everywhere, and like, heal me up."
2288.16,2291.16," So the thing is, is, is you fight for their favor."
2291.16,2293.16, So there's only two medics on your team.
2293.16,2297.16," You want to be, if you, if you want to go over, you know, high score and be, you know, the superstar"
2297.16,2302.16," team and, and capture the points and break their defenses down or stop them on their"
2302.16,2306.16," offense, like, if you have a medic with you, you're so set."
2306.16,2311.16," But then when, I think Rory's getting, but they jealous basically because he doesn't have his own,"
2311.16,2313.16, he doesn't have his own banana rider.
2313.16,2316.16," Oh, he needs to step up."
2316.16,2319.16," So he's going to be like, because there'll be cases where he knows like my score will be like"
2319.16,2324.16," 100 something, and then the next highest up will be like 60, and it'll be like, and it's just because"
2324.16,2328.16," and that that is part, it's not just like, you don't just latch a medic on to anyone."
2328.16,2332.16," Like, you, you have to know how to work with the prison bitch, but you love."
2332.16,2338.16," But then you get like, yeah, but then, if you know how to play well together, then the benefits"
2338.16,2341.16," are there. But anyway, so I got to thank it, this, this guy, diplomat, I wanted to"
2341.16,2344.16," get a shout out because he's not a banana rider. He's actually, he's just a really"
2344.16,2348.16," player, and he can play medic well, and it's like cool enough to do it."
2348.16,2354.16," But so I give some like class specific things before, but I think now, as people"
2354.16,2359.16," have been playing a lot more, there's just kind of some general interesting points."
2359.16,2363.16," One, a few exploit things that, you know, and so it's so in Rory and asking that talk about this too."
2363.16,2368.16," Like, if you want points in your engineer, you're in a circumstance where your turret, your"
2368.16,2372.16," centry is not shooting guys down every other second, build teleporter's next one,"
2372.16,2376.16," and other because we've found out that every teleportation event will, or in"
2376.16,2381.16," half a point. So two of them, you get a full point. So you put them there, and when, in"
2381.16,2384.16," between, when nothing's going on, you just keep going over and over in your"
2384.16,2387.16," teleport. Come out one side up the other and it retards just, and just, you just"
2387.16,2392.16," keep doing that, you know. People that are really dumb, and they want to"
2392.16,2395.16," just get, you know, you know, how every time you load a map, it gives you"
2395.16,2400.16," your ranking, your top scores. Well, you get a friend into a server as a spy,"
2400.16,2405.16," and you're an engineer, and each map has a location, not every map, but"
2405.16,2408.16, some maps have these locations that are not very heavily traveled.
2408.16,2412.16," And when, what you do is you go there's an engineer build your centry, have the"
2412.16,2416.16," spy come in, sap it, but sap around it, you hit the wrench, knock it off, repeat"
2416.16,2420.16," over and over and over again, and you just watch your score climb, and then you"
2420.16,2424.16," can go away, and it says, you know, your top score, playing engineers, whatever"
2424.16,2432.16," hundred and something. But more, more general things would be like, rather than"
2432.16,2436.16," looking at just like, I mean, you do want to know the best way to play each class,"
2436.16,2439.16," but something more important, I think, is like the meta game involved, and that's"
2439.16,2444.16," looking at the course of the game, and saying, given these circumstances, it"
2444.16,2449.16," will probably be wise for me to switch classes. So I say you go in as a soldier,"
2450.16,2456.16," and you see a super centry gun heavy defense. And you say, you don't sit like, you"
2456.16,2459.16," know, I don't say, hey, let's go be a spy, because you're never, unless the"
2459.16,2463.16," engineers are completely idiotic, you're not going to go and blow up all those."
2463.16,2467.16," So instead I'll go to demo man, and where I can find some angle of approach where"
2467.16,2470.16," I'm covered, and I can throw pipe bombs in, and I can blow everything up all"
2470.16,2474.16," at once. So as soon as I do that, maybe they all switch to soldiers. So then"
2474.16,2477.16," all think, you know, switch to some other class, but it's kind of like, you can"
2477.16,2481.16, only give the general advice as to like always be aware of like when the circumstances
2481.16,2485.16, would favor one class over another. And that's the make-ups are always
2485.16,2489.16," changing on each team. I mean, that to me seems like one of the more obvious."
2489.16,2494.16," It is, but everyone, but I understand that the not everybody does, but like"
2494.16,2498.16," when I, when I join a server, the first thing I do is hit tab, but I see what"
2498.16,2502.16," the make-ups are, and to see where it's you, where there's a whole on my"
2502.16,2505.16," own team, and see what would make most sense against what's there, right?"
2505.16,2508.16," It just seems, I mean, specifically in how they're"
2508.16,2511.16," fielding it to, how they're fielding those assets, like, but that is"
2511.16,2514.16," rad, because a lot of times people will join in, and it won't say, and it"
2514.16,2516.16," will be like, what if there's like six heavy weapons guys?"
2516.16,2519.16," Well, that's what I notice on a lot of servers, and the games usually"
2519.16,2524.16," suck, is that clearly there's been no no discussion at all, or even"
2524.16,2528.16, awareness if people aren't talking over what's missing here.
2528.16,2530.16," Yeah. Wow, there's your old spies, really."
2530.16,2534.16, That's what makes the map to fort is kind of like the most loved and
2534.16,2537.16," the most hated map, and because it seems to a lot of people, like, it's just"
2537.16,2541.16," death match for it, or stalemate for it or something, but if you play as a"
2541.16,2545.16," team, it's so rewarding because it's like, just the right mix where it"
2545.16,2549.16," takes some serious effort to get the flag, it takes significant effort to"
2549.16,2553.16," defend it, and you have to constantly, like, be changing your make-ups"
2553.16,2557.16," working together. You can't just spawn in a trick or where, say, I get"
2557.16,2559.16," kill less spawn, run out my door and run to their base again, mean"
2559.16,2562.16," while all 10 seconds later, so one else will do the same, and I mean, you"
2562.16,2565.16," can't get it like coordinate and communicate on that, and it's a lot of fun"
2565.16,2569.16," to play. Um, so yeah, I mean, those are a few things."
2569.16,2572.16," Some other interesting things are like when, um, immediately on a"
2572.16,2577.16," technofend map, when a medic combo comes out of the gate, and they're"
2577.16,2580.16," going to be overcharged if they're smart, you know, they basically inflict damage"
2580.16,2584.16," on themselves in the inside their spawn area, so that they can get the"
2584.16,2588.16," overcharged build up before the gates open. And when they come out, a lot of"
2588.16,2591.16," people, well, there's two wasteful things. A lot of times people just keep"
2591.16,2595.16," shooting at an Uber to enemy with the, the old nerds tail that if you hit"
2595.16,2599.16," them enough, you'll reduce the duration of the Uber, but that's not true."
2599.16,2602.16," The times that it does make sense to hit them those, if you're a soldier, if you're"
2602.16,2605.16," demo man, you know, pipe bonus, what happens is that you could still"
2605.16,2608.16, fling them and throw them. So you throw a bunch of pipe bombs in the
2608.16,2612.16," ground, they come out the gate, right? They're vulnerable to damage. They are,"
2612.16,2615.16, but what happens is sometimes you could throw the guy so far away from the
2615.16,2619.16," medic that you break their beam, and then the Uber goes away because you"
2619.16,2623.16," thrown them so far apart or something like that, you know, Mark. So there's a lot"
2623.16,2627.16, of stuff like that that people are starting to pick up on.
2627.16,2631.16," By the way, let's point out that once again, Sean Ali is wearing a team"
2631.16,2635.16," boy. She was shit. Oh, I was worried with that. Oh, yeah."
2635.16,2639.16, It's very slow. Not coincidentally discussing the game on our podcast.
2639.16,2643.16," She's a little kickback from Valve this way. We do have a, we're in the"
2643.16,2647.16," shirt, talk about the game. And we got the one up server too. It's not"
2647.16,2651.16," the one up, but someone made it the one up server. And we all go on there and play."
2651.16,2654.16," And it's cool. I think, yeah, we got, they're going to, they're going to give me some"
2654.16,2659.16, admin privilege. So how many of my first staff need to be to ban everyone else that
2659.16,2664.16," gave me the privilege? No, you have three of these shirts now. Three."
2664.16,2669.16," Why are you making a show? So it was like today, oh, it's Thursday."
2669.16,2673.16," It's sold today. Yes, tomorrow's heavy weapons day."
2674.16,2677.16," How fast. But you know, you know how you said that's it's self evident."
2677.16,2682.16," Though, I mean, like that that you should mix classes. Right. But my evidence for the"
2682.16,2685.16," fact that it's not is when everyone says, what class do you play?"
2685.16,2689.16," Which assumes that you just do one, and it's like, say, it's like tech and"
2689.16,2691.16," or something. And you like, you're a cool man, you're a cool man."
2691.16,2695.16," Do you? Well, I have the deep like to me. It's a default. Like now I'm just"
2695.16,2699.16," well, prison bitch, I guess. I mean, I like, I like, medic. So when I go"
2699.16,2703.16," on to play, I'll say, my I'm saying to myself, I'm going to play medic, but I'll"
2703.16,2707.16," I'll press tab. And if there's three medics on the team already, I'll go, well, okay,"
2707.16,2711.16," not this time. Yeah. I'll just go do something else. If you're doing it,"
2711.16,2714.16," well, though, that is maybe the one class that you can't if you're paired up,"
2714.16,2718.16," like, say, if you have three parings of medics in a soldier heavy."
2718.16,2722.16," Yeah, like that's a, I mean, it's almost like a demo and a soldier's almost"
2722.16,2725.16," better than two soldiers depending on the circumstance, whether it's offence or"
2725.16,2728.16," defense. Well, now when you say play in the Commonwealth, like how"
2728.16,2730.16, what's the difference between playing a medic well and playing a medic
2730.16,2734.16, poorly? There's like the entry level thing. And that's when you first
2734.16,2737.16, start off spawning. And you see a medic immediately turned his
2737.16,2740.16," hose to a heavy weapons guy and stand there. Meanwhile, all the"
2740.16,2744.16," soldiers are standing in front of the resupply boxes, screaming for"
2744.16,2748.16, medics. And the reason they're over there is because they don't have
2748.16,2750.16, to reload their rockets. When you shoot four rockets in your
2750.16,2753.16," front of their automatically, just puts you back up to four. So what"
2753.16,2756.16," happens? You just hold fire down, stand in front of it. Oh, my"
2757.16,2760.16," God. And you splash damage yourself. Okay. So much, and the"
2760.16,2763.16," medic keeps you alive, and it fills up a zoo for before the gates"
2763.16,2767.16," even open. So if you see that, I mean, that's the base level."
2767.16,2770.16, That means ignore that medic. That means that medic does not exist
2770.16,2773.16, in your mind. There might be a random chance that he will turn and
2773.16,2777.16," maybe help you in some capacity. But otherwise, he just is just like,"
2777.16,2781.16," yeah, it's just like a spray tag on the wall or something, you know,"
2781.16,2786.16," so when he hit teen, a medic came out. But then the good ones will"
2786.16,2790.16," know, of course, I mean, there's, there's a good banana rider, and"
2790.16,2792.16, then there's a good general medic. And I got to be careful to
2792.16,2794.16, like differentiate them because I don't want to be like the good
2794.16,2797.16, medics don't want to follow me around wherever I go and does whatever
2797.16,2800.16," I tell him he needs to do. But, no, it's like, but they are"
2800.16,2803.16," good. They see where the guy's going. They keep the, the, the, the"
2803.16,2806.16," the thing connected, but they also know that there's other guy"
2806.16,2809.16," around him. And they're going in for offense. And it's like, hey,"
2809.16,2812.16, we have another soldier here. He's got 20 health. Just by turning
2812.16,2815.16," to him for a second, healing them up again, we now have two"
2815.16,2818.16," soldiers going in on this offense. Plus me, as opposed to, we'll"
2818.16,2821.16," screw him. I'm not going to get, I'm not going to stop charging"
2821.16,2823.16, this one guy and we'll just let him die. And there's a huge
2823.16,2827.16," waste. You can had a overhealed soldier, which means, you know,"
2827.16,2830.16," 300 health going with you. So basically, just being aware and"
2830.16,2834.16," also, and also knowing that they can fight immediately knowing,"
2834.16,2837.16," I mean, because the bone saw is excellent melee. The high"
2837.16,2841.16," bit, high bit, the gun is great. Knowing when, so if you're"
2841.16,2843.16," healing someone, and you see, you know, there's a spy coming"
2843.16,2846.16," behind you instead of just screaming spy spy spy, switch to your"
2846.16,2849.16," bone saw, turn around, stop healing, turn around and hit him before"
2849.16,2852.16," you can get you or shoot him and then go back. I mean, so like, you"
2852.16,2854.16," know, a really good one. Like, I got to say the, the different"
2854.16,2857.16," guys, like, he's self sufficient at the same time. And then,"
2857.16,2861.16," the last thing would be in, in a, in a spawn waves, instead"
2861.16,2864.16," of just running out as a medic and saying, well, maybe I'll"
2864.16,2866.16, find someone and you find someone that you are working
2866.16,2869.16, well with that you can rely on because there's other thing. It's not all
2869.16,2872.16," about what the, it's not just what the medic can do for you. But"
2872.16,2875.16," like I said, the prison analogy is what you can do for the medic"
2875.16,2878.16, and return. So the pack of cigarettes that you give him is
2878.16,2881.16, basically turning around and spy checking for him and stuff
2881.16,2884.16," too. You know, you don't just run around blindly to what's going"
2884.16,2887.16, behind you because a medic with his healing gun is a huge target
2887.16,2891.16, for a spy because he's almost guaranteed to be just like
2891.16,2893.16," a gun. And then he's like, you know, you're just"
2893.16,2897.16," just doing this thing. So just constantly looking, making sure that"
2897.16,2900.16, pyro's aren't jumping down behind him and and coming after you guys
2900.16,2903.16," and stuff. And then so what happens is when they do find a good, when you"
2903.16,2907.16," find a good mate, then you, uh, you wait at the spawn for them, you"
2907.16,2909.16," know, they get killed or something. You, you, you'd like weight"
2909.16,2913.16," or just say where you're at where you can meet up, you know, have a,"
2913.16,2920.16," have a quiet ceremony in Honolulu. Yeah. Oh, shit. Hey,"
2920.16,2925.16," yeah. Go ahead. What? I got nothing. Okay. And I was just,"
2925.16,2928.16," I was just checking the time. Yeah. Obviously, we got, um,"
2928.16,2931.16," we kind of hear the web, but we got to hear the web. And I got to,"
2931.16,2935.16," I got this, uh, private message I was going to read. Oh, yeah."
2935.16,2939.16, That's time for that. That guy. Ray time. That's the right time.
2939.16,2942.16, That is the right time. Just kind of relates back to Sean's
2942.16,2948.16," surreal dream earlier, not, not dream. Yeah. But I was"
2948.16,2952.16," thinking about this guy during your whole life. Oh, my friend. My friend,"
2952.16,2956.16," uh, wiki. Yeah. The whole thing. Right. Um, well, this, the"
2956.16,2960.16," shot up in my one up in box a few days ago, the subject was"
2960.16,2966.16," shroom with me. Five, ohs. And message is dear,"
2966.16,2970.16, Jeffrey Green. I currently have seven mature water bottle
2970.16,2975.16," cultures of silo side, uh, semilonciada, I believe you"
2975.16,2980.16," know, uh, aka Liberty caps. Is it okay if I send you guys at"
2980.16,2986.16, GFW three eights of them? The package would be to zif Davis
2986.16,2990.16," media, Jeff Green. I'll look it up in the mag. That's good."
2990.16,2994.16," Thanks, fella. That won't give me fired. By the way, I love the"
2994.16,2999.16, November issue. Right in the middle of the drug. I love the
2999.16,3002.16, November. That's the way that's the way to say things. Yeah. If she
3002.16,3007.16," was a trust, I S H U by the way, issue. Uh, it won't have my"
3007.16,3011.16, address and you can all trip balls and do a special podcast.
3011.16,3015.16," You just listen to it. Please, Jeff, I'm begging you to let me"
3015.16,3019.16," send you psychotropic drugs. Yeah. Yeah, you just wasn't. He"
3019.16,3024.16," is sense, PM to me many times to saying how serious he is. And he"
3024.16,3030.16," in particular wants Ryan to trip balls. You, because he wants to"
3030.16,3035.16," ride on an epic on a quote unquote epic Guild Wars rant. He's like,"
3035.16,3038.16, he would you get Ryan talking. I guarantee it. I don't need to be
3038.16,3045.16," high to do a Guild Wars rant. Yeah, then after that, I think"
3045.16,3049.16," like he could tell we were, you weren't accepting his offer."
3049.16,3053.16," Did you tell Jeff, I can send him some marijuana? Like, what"
3053.16,3058.16," I want that. I told him, uh, I told him, thank you. That's"
3058.16,3063.16," very generous of you. As an employee of Zif Davis media,"
3063.16,3066.16," afraid I have to say no, you could, for the offer of the"
3066.16,3070.16, illegal drugs. You couldn't at to my workplace. I could have
3070.16,3072.16," given him the dress, but just had it be like San Francisco"
3072.16,3075.16," police department to say, see Jeff Green, right?"
3075.16,3078.16," Actually, you wouldn't watch your name on your house. Probably"
3078.16,3082.16," not. Sorry. Yeah, I'm games for Windows. Yeah. Yeah."
3082.16,3085.16," We saw, I'm not going to say his name on the air."
3086.16,3089.16, I'm not. Okay. I'm just kidding. I was just trying to
3089.16,3092.16, hook you up. He's more partly trying to hook Ryan up.
3092.16,3095.16," The problem is we can't, you know, mushrooms. We can't have a"
3095.16,3097.16, six hour podcast.
3097.16,3103.16, Maybe we could. We could describe our mood as the
3103.16,3105.16, hours past. We could send it. Have one listener.
3105.16,3109.16, You know that guy. He'd be with us the whole way. We could
3109.16,3113.16," send them to a enchanted toast. Who's, uh, this week's"
3113.16,3119.16," show the web. Okay. Um, it's a, uh, a stupid name. I don't"
3119.16,3123.16," know. So, uh, here are the web. If you're a new listener is"
3123.16,3128.16," just basically something of, you know, vital importance we find on"
3128.16,3131.16," the internet, something that someone posted in a message"
3131.16,3136.16," board forum or something. So, um, a channel toast says,"
3136.16,3140.16," the few days ago, I made a threat on the official Nintendo"
3140.16,3144.16, forum that I was in love with Marin from Link's Awakening.
3144.16,3148.16, I said the reason I was in love with her was because of her
3148.16,3152.16," personality, her appearance, her dreams and everything else."
3152.16,3155.16, I've been in love with her since childhood when I had my
3155.16,3159.16," gameboy. Marin was a girl on an island with no powers, just"
3159.16,3164.16, words of serene and wanting to fulfill her dream. The story and
3164.16,3168.16," everything touched my heart. No, I did whoever told everyone"
3168.16,3172.16," that I understand that Marin was not real, but I actually found"
3172.16,3175.16, out that emotions telling me I was in love with the real Marin
3175.16,3179.16," that was really out there. In other words, we feel that"
3179.16,3182.16, Miamoto knew these Zelda characters when he drew them from
3182.16,3188.16, certain people. A lot of people were touched by my message
3188.16,3191.16, and said we should go on a search for Miamoto to find the true answer
3191.16,3195.16," to our romances. Oh God. In other words, we want to ask Miamoto"
3195.16,3200.16, Dono where the real Zelda people were and he got his ideas from.
3200.16,3205.16," We feel Miamoto dono really knew people named Zelda, Marin, Malone,"
3205.16,3210.16, Link etc. And our personalities have put them into the game.
3210.16,3214.16, We're going to form a search party for Miamoto.
3214.16,3219.16," Because these questions we have, we have been wanting to know them all of our lives."
3219.16,3223.16, Sometimes we even sighted when we were in love with the characters
3223.16,3228.16," in game and we knew we would never meet them. I cried. However, I feel that we"
3228.16,3233.16," can't find them. I tried to get everyone to come with me on this search,"
3233.16,3237.16, but we were still discussing the situation when the topic reached
3237.16,3246.16," 390 posts. In a way, staff deleted it. We don't know why, but it happened."
3246.16,3250.16, So I found this site and I'm pushing it.
3250.16,3253.16," I'm pushing it. In a way, it's the 10 over America. It took me a minute."
3253.16,3257.16," So I found this site and I'm hoping that this site is the same site,"
3257.16,3263.16, searching for the dreams and the answers to the Zelda characters with whom we are in love.
3263.16,3268.16, I have loved so much for Marin that I sometimes shed tears over her.
3268.16,3273.16," I know you guys think I might be weird or even crazy for loving the game character,"
3273.16,3279.16," but I am not. You see, it is our emotion that we are trying to reach out to a certain person."
3279.16,3284.16, We love. We can't help it if we are touched by the character's personality.
3284.16,3287.16," Looks and so on, etc."
3287.16,3291.16, So I'm just posting here if anyone has suggestions to our situation.
3291.16,3295.16," I actually have a lot of people that want to come with me and find me a mother,"
3295.16,3298.16, so you can answer these questions.
3298.16,3303.16, Our love is really strong for this journey so much that we don't want to put it aside.
3303.16,3307.16," Finally, I'm asking the Nintendo of America staff"
3307.16,3311.16, if they could please revive the thread and give me access to the thread
3311.16,3316.16, so that I can document the pages as lots and lots of work was deleted.
3316.16,3322.16, Can you imagine being a motor and opening the door to that pilgrimage?
3322.16,3326.16, That would look good.
3326.16,3329.16, Because I got modern canterbury tales.
3329.16,3331.16, Try to find...
3331.16,3333.16, Isn't there something like that?
3333.16,3336.16, Someone is looking for the real such and such?
3336.16,3339.16, They are not looking for the guy who created them.
3339.16,3341.16, To tell them who the real one is.
3341.16,3344.16, I will tell you now. I am the real tingle.
3344.16,3347.16, You want to be saved?
3347.16,3348.16, You want this parade?
3348.16,3349.16," No, I can't imagine."
3349.16,3350.16, I have fucked up.
3350.16,3354.16," I'm not like knocking on JJ Abrams house and saying,"
3354.16,3356.16, who's the real...
3356.16,3358.16, But don't even lock.
3358.16,3360.16, Who's the real one?
3360.16,3363.16, There's a character that played Locked at least as a person.
3363.16,3364.16, There's a connection there.
3364.16,3366.16, It would be more like...
3366.16,3370.16, Who inspired you to get on a Game Boy character?
3370.16,3373.16," Yeah, the Game Boy Link thing."
3373.16,3375.16, I like the whole thing.
3375.16,3378.16, It's like I've been out all based on...
3378.16,3382.16, He's in love with the personality that must have come from a real person.
3382.16,3384.16, But then he slips in at the end.
3384.16,3385.16, The looks.
3385.16,3387.16, He's like...
3387.16,3388.16, He's kind of killed.
3389.16,3391.16, He's going to be so disappointed.
3391.16,3393.16, What the hell?
3393.16,3396.16, I've put them real marines like a 65 year old guy.
3396.16,3398.16, Then when did he get to do?
3398.16,3400.16, That would be the true test.
3400.16,3401.16, Then he would do it.
3401.16,3403.16, This is how strong his love is.
3403.16,3404.16, What was this?
3404.16,3407.16, Is this sort of shades of being John Malkovich?
3407.16,3409.16, Maybe possibly?
3409.16,3411.16, There's a lot of that.
3411.16,3414.16, It's a shade of insanity.
3415.16,3417.16, Who's that writer?
3417.16,3418.16, Who wrote that?
3418.16,3420.16," No, he was a director."
3420.16,3421.16, He was a director.
3421.16,3422.16, Oh yeah.
3422.16,3425.16, So this sounds like a work that he could take.
3425.16,3426.16, Take it out of this.
3426.16,3428.16, It could make a great movie.
3428.16,3429.16, I'll play a...
3429.16,3430.16, Oh man.
3430.16,3431.16, It toast for you.
3431.16,3432.16, If you want to.
3432.16,3434.16, You can pee on me on one of that.
3434.16,3436.16, Just by...
3436.16,3438.16," What do you pale overweight guys,"
3438.16,3440.16, traveling each hand?
3440.16,3441.16, I was so sure.
3441.16,3442.16, I'm going to be the real man.
3442.16,3444.16, I guess his adaptation was kind of like that.
3444.16,3445.16, Adoptation.
3445.16,3447.16," Yeah, that's what I mean everything he does is got some sort of..."
3447.16,3452.16, It didn't also do what was the other one with Jim Carrey.
3452.16,3455.16," Oh, I was also a internal sunshine episode."
3455.16,3456.16, Yeah.
3456.16,3457.16, Yeah.
3457.16,3458.16," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3458.16,3459.16, He date.
3459.16,3461.16," You're gay, they like those."
3461.16,3463.16, Are we down here?
3463.16,3464.16, I saw.
3464.16,3466.16," We don't have people gathering, but then they walked away."
3466.16,3467.16," Yeah, we sent him off."
3467.16,3468.16, We had our limits.
3468.16,3469.16, Keep going.
3469.16,3470.16, Right.
3470.16,3471.16, We'll keep...
3471.16,3473.16, We'll keep gabbing until they throw us out.
3473.16,3474.16, Yeah.
3474.16,3475.16, We're rebels that way.
3475.16,3476.16, I'm never going to give about though.
3476.16,3478.16, So we can talk about what we're playing.
3478.16,3480.16, That's always a good thing to fall back on.
3480.16,3482.16, We just talk about that shit all day.
3482.16,3485.16, I was going to tell one...
3485.16,3487.16, Back on the mushrooms thing.
3487.16,3488.16, Let's do it.
3488.16,3489.16," Yeah, that sounds good."
3489.16,3493.16, It's got nothing to do with me because I'm against all sorts of illegal substances.
3493.16,3496.16, I've campaigned actively against them.
3497.16,3498.16, Yeah.
3498.16,3500.16, With the Reagan administration.
3500.16,3501.16, Exactly.
3501.16,3502.16, Yeah.
3502.16,3505.16, I'm one of the mothers against drunk driving.
3505.16,3510.16," It was also your idea to put in the box for our pain candies when you open the flap, the"
3510.16,3511.16, St. Orte drugs.
3511.16,3512.16, Actually they hugged the drugs.
3512.16,3514.16, Just saying no was me.
3514.16,3515.16, I gave that to you.
3515.16,3516.16, That's true.
3516.16,3517.16, Yeah.
3517.16,3519.16, What about that different strokes episode with Nancy Reagan?
3519.16,3520.16, Was that?
3520.16,3521.16, I wrote that.
3521.16,3522.16, Yeah.
3522.16,3524.16, I don't know why I'm telling the story.
3524.16,3525.16, I just...
3525.16,3528.16, It's just my first encounter with anybody on mushrooms.
3528.16,3530.16, I actually was totally stonkled sober.
3530.16,3533.16, I was at my dorm room in UC Berkeley.
3533.16,3534.16, God's on the truth.
3534.16,3535.16, I was sober.
3535.16,3536.16, I was actually studying that night.
3536.16,3538.16," And a friend of mine, this..."
3538.16,3539.16, This'll age me.
3539.16,3540.16, Was at the...
3540.16,3542.16, Jehthro tall concert.
3542.16,3543.16, Yeah.
3543.16,3544.16, The Oakland Colseum.
3544.16,3547.16, And he was on mushrooms.
3547.16,3549.16, And I knew he had taken them to go to the show.
3549.16,3551.16, And he came back from the show.
3551.16,3555.16," And I ran into him in the hallway and I was, I called him my math book, or whatever,"
3555.16,3557.16, do we be thing I was working on.
3557.16,3560.16," And I said, hey, how is the Jehthro tall concert?"
3560.16,3562.16, And he looked at me.
3562.16,3564.16, And then he looked at the wall.
3564.16,3567.16, And he kept looking at the wall.
3567.16,3569.16, For about one minute.
3569.16,3572.16, Which is a long time if you look into the wall not saying anything.
3572.16,3575.16, And then he just kept looking at the wall not saying anything.
3575.16,3577.16," And I just said, I'll see you tomorrow."
3577.16,3578.16, Okay.
3579.16,3582.16," Because I think after I asked him that question,"
3582.16,3584.16, he was kind of back at Dr. Thultal at that moment.
3584.16,3586.16, I'm glad you asked.
3586.16,3587.16, Let me show you.
3587.16,3588.16," Right, right."
3588.16,3590.16, Right. He was letting me know when he was mine.
3590.16,3591.16, That's pretty harmless.
3591.16,3592.16, He opened with Aqual on.
3592.16,3595.16, You had to lick his sweat and you would have been...
3595.16,3596.16, Then I would have had the whole concert.
3596.16,3599.16," At least he wasn't like trying to break down shit for you like,"
3599.16,3602.16," Jeff, have you ever thought about infinite space?"
3602.16,3603.16," You're like, yeah."
3603.16,3606.16," Then he goes, just keeps going."
3607.16,3608.16, Going.
3608.16,3609.16, Going.
3609.16,3612.16, There's stories like the abbreviated version.
3612.16,3616.16, But instances where someone was pranked out enough so that they...
3616.16,3619.16," They have an apartment their own house and they start thinking,"
3619.16,3620.16, This isn't Tony though.
3620.16,3623.16," I talked about him before he was a metatic, but they have a party at their house."
3623.16,3625.16, You're saying guy with a dirty underwear or something?
3625.16,3626.16, Another one.
3626.16,3629.16, Suddenly becomes convinced that they're...
3629.16,3631.16, They're people in the walls.
3631.16,3634.16, And so get to hatch it and write in the middle of his own party in his own house.
3634.16,3636.16, Starts chou up.
3636.16,3637.16, That wall to find that wall.
3637.16,3639.16, And everyone's working for Marin.
3639.16,3641.16, Everyone goes running and running away.
3641.16,3643.16, And that party is over just like that.
3643.16,3645.16," Yeah, that's a little bit of a party killer."
3645.16,3647.16, Nothing like that here.
3647.16,3650.16, I saw a bunch of older people...
3650.16,3655.16," Well, because I went to a Led Zeppelin tribute band concert a couple of weekends ago."
3655.16,3657.16," Like, you can see small town."
3657.16,3659.16, And it was all the locals and they were all...
3659.16,3661.16," Fairly old, but they were all trippin' balls."
3661.16,3663.16, And it was weird.
3663.16,3667.16, It was like seeing almost like your grandpa just wandering around.
3667.16,3668.16, There was one old guy.
3668.16,3671.16, He looked more like Cliff Klave and he could open an older clip plate.
3671.16,3673.16, He just kept like barreling through the crowd.
3673.16,3676.16," And like, just like, what the fuck dude, I felt like I was..."
3676.16,3678.16, I'm about ready to have to throw down with Cliff Klaveman.
3678.16,3679.16," Because he kept like, Klaveman."
3679.16,3680.16," I'm like, Klaveman."
3680.16,3681.16, It's from tears.
3681.16,3683.16, Maybe you don't get any of the TV references.
3683.16,3686.16, You got to rent some DVDs and get hit with the pop culture.
3686.16,3687.16, Okay.
3687.16,3690.16," But eventually, old..."
3690.16,3691.16, The old...
3691.16,3692.16, The old...
3692.16,3697.16," The old bouncer took out the old Cliff Klaveman, like, young concert style."
3697.16,3700.16," Like, obviously came up, grabbed him and dragged him out."
3700.16,3701.16, And it was just...
3701.16,3703.16," He was trying to mosh or something to, like..."
3703.16,3708.16," He was also, like, basically, I think just trying to cop feels in all the ladies."
3708.16,3709.16," Oh, check it."
3709.16,3712.16," Well, that thing is, you know, you're..."
3712.16,3715.16, Older rock and rollers are getting older now.
3715.16,3716.16," Yeah, but they're still..."
3716.16,3718.16, They're still rock and rollin'.
3718.16,3719.16, I'm talking about myself.
3719.16,3720.16," Yeah, I was about to start."
3720.16,3723.16," But I was, uh, last Thursday, I went to the Bruce Bringsing concert at..."
3723.16,3724.16, At the Oconcassi.
3724.16,3727.16," And you can go ahead and mock Bringsing, but in his day he was..."
3727.16,3728.16, You don't talk shit on the box.
3728.16,3729.16, He was cool and still...
3729.16,3730.16, He was cool and still...
3730.16,3731.16, He was cool and still...
3731.16,3732.16, He still the boss.
3732.16,3734.16," Uh, and it was a great concert."
3734.16,3736.16," But what I noticed was, uh..."
3736.16,3739.16," You know, the section we were sitting in, the seat first of all, the seats cost..."
3739.16,3741.16," Like, $100 a piece."
3741.16,3743.16," So, you know, that's not a very rock and roll sort of thing."
3744.16,3747.16," And basically, everybody in our section is like,"
3747.16,3749.16," Dockers wearing, like, fucking, you know..."
3749.16,3754.16," Practically, everybody in the section I was in, at some point during the show was texting."
3754.16,3757.16," Like, you know, texting to their babysitter, whatever."
3757.16,3759.16," You know, people are, yeah, I mean,"
3759.16,3761.16," You won't believe what I'm at, we're at Madden."
3761.16,3762.16," Yeah, but not in a can't wait."
3762.16,3764.16," You were on, you was like in a dulled way."
3764.16,3765.16," I mean, it was all..."
3765.16,3767.16, It was all people like my age and older.
3767.16,3769.16," It's all very kind of like, um, man."
3769.16,3770.16, Just now.
3770.16,3772.16," And watching everybody dance, which they probably look like the way I was."
3772.16,3774.16," It was like, oh, this is just so depressing."
3774.16,3775.16," You know, yeah."
3775.16,3778.16, That had had more than I was born and run.
3778.16,3783.16," Um, but, uh, the thing I noticed, the thing that really blew me away about this concert was,"
3783.16,3788.16," Um, I'd actually been at Dockersaw seeing 27 years ago to see the same guy"
3788.16,3789.16, to see Spring See Night.
3789.16,3790.16, I remember how awesome that was.
3790.16,3793.16," Four hours long, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
3793.16,3795.16," But at the end of the night when, you know,"
3795.16,3798.16," the Bruce Lee's a staging waiting for the on-course,"
3798.16,3802.16, I don't know when the last time you guys had been to a big time rock concert was.
3802.16,3804.16," The end of the night, the lighter thing."
3804.16,3805.16, People don't do lighter.
3805.16,3806.16, They need to know what it is.
3806.16,3807.16, You know what it is?
3807.16,3808.16, You just try to bring that back.
3808.16,3809.16, I can sell fast.
3809.16,3813.16, Everybody holds up their cell phones and the lights of the cell phones are going around the calls.
3813.16,3814.16, That made me very sad the first time.
3814.16,3815.16, Yeah.
3815.16,3818.16," And also, like, you ever get a call from some buffoon?"
3818.16,3819.16, And you pick up the phone.
3819.16,3820.16, Guess where I'm.
3820.16,3821.16," It's like,"
3822.16,3826.16," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
3826.16,3828.16, Let me just text back.
3828.16,3829.16, Fuck you.
3829.16,3832.16," But I did notice the, I did not."
3832.16,3834.16," So the, like, the cell phone light by me out."
3834.16,3839.16, But I did notice the aroma of marijuana whafting up through the old folks crowd.
3839.16,3841.16," And I saw people down in the, uh, floor."
3841.16,3843.16, All the old people kind of dance in a way.
3843.16,3844.16," And I felt like, okay."
3844.16,3845.16, Yeah.
3845.16,3846.16, All right.
3846.16,3847.16, We could still do this.
3847.16,3848.16, It's weird though.
3848.16,3851.3999999999996," He said that party that Chris Boom was talking about with Halloween costumes, there"
3851.3999999999996,3854.66, are some people various points tonight out here and talking about the new radio head
3854.66,3855.66, album.
3855.66,3859.02," And I think it's a great album, but it really put it in perspective."
3859.02,3863.7599999999998," I was like, it reminds me of, you know, like, whatever 10 years ago, and you hear"
3863.7599999999998,3867.48," that the 30 set was in there, just talking about that pink Floyd, they got a new album"
3867.48,3869.72, out or that you got to hear the new moody blues.
3869.72,3872.2," And it's like, yeah, you know, my big problem."
3872.2,3873.2," Yeah, we're already there."
3873.2,3875.2," My, my, yeah, that's not all."
3875.2,3876.2, We're already making it.
3876.2799999999997,3880.4399999999996," Now you know, I feel what I, what I can't see on a bit about this, this particular"
3880.4399999999996,3884.4399999999996," floor where there's lots of, let's see you a young fall care with your new video game"
3884.4399999999996,3888.72," jabs is obviously sitting in my, in my office, point something like Nirvana, and one of"
3888.72,3893.48," these fucking editors, like, you know, whatever Donna, however, he actually didn't do it,"
3893.48,3897.8399999999997," but, you know, that age bracket will come by and go, wow, you listen to Nirvana, that's so"
3897.8399999999997,3898.8399999999997, cool.
3898.8399999999997,3899.8399999999997," Oh, I'm a fucker there."
3899.8399999999997,3900.8399999999997, My age.
3900.8399999999997,3901.8399999999997, Fuck you.
3901.8399999999997,3902.8399999999997, That's what you're.
3902.92,3918.88," Oh, I got one thing that I could bring up and we could shut it down if it's not going"
3918.88,3921.76," anywhere, but there's a new trend with console games."
3921.76,3926.44," I'm not what's happening with PC games in terms of like reviewing games, reviewers guides"
3926.44,3927.44, start with it.
3927.44,3928.92, It started with layer.
3928.92,3933.2400000000002, It's any game that's like not pick up and play or where they can anticipate the people
3933.2400000000002,3934.2400000000002, are having difficulties.
3934.2400000000002,3935.6," In some cases, it's every game."
3935.6,3938.92," For depending on the publisher, we just got along with Tabula Ross, so we got a reviewers"
3938.92,3939.92, guide.
3939.92,3942.32," Medal of Honor, airborne came with one, called really good."
3942.32,3943.32, Really?
3943.32,3945.32," What do you think about that, Chris?"
3945.32,3947.04," Well, I don't want to read them."
3947.04,3949.36, I don't want to read them till like I'm done with the game.
3949.36,3952.04," I mean, I didn't actually have it for layer when I played layer."
3952.04,3953.44, I had a lot of problems with layer.
3953.44,3958.6, This is the PS3 Dragon Writing game that relied solely on motion control and that Dragon
3958.6,3960.6, just did not listen to me.
3960.6,3964.36," It ended up being like, actually, I think a lot of people are the same experience."
3964.36,3966.4, And now there's one with Assassin's Creed.
3966.4,3968.56, Assassin's Creed takes it a step farther.
3968.56,3972.8399999999997, Assassin's Creed's a game where you're back in the Crusades in Assassin.
3972.8399999999997,3973.8399999999997, It's from Ubisoft.
3973.8399999999997,3980.12," If they take it a step further with a hotline in Assassin's Creed, hotline in the reviewers"
3980.12,3984.64," guide, basically, it's funny though, because the hours are only between 10 and 3, so you"
3984.64,3987.6, can't like call it 9 at night.
3987.6,3991.68," And I think it'd be funny to get a little kid to call it and then be like, hi, I'm stuck"
3991.68,3993.68, on level 6.
3993.68,3995.68, So this is strictly for the press to call.
3995.68,3997.16," It's a hotline for, yeah."
3997.16,3999.48," Yes, but I'm debating putting it in the review."
3999.48,4002.0," By the way, I feel stuck."
4002.0,4007.2799999999997, I quoted the review guide for the Medal of Honor Airborne review.
4007.2799999999997,4008.2799999999997, Really?
4008.2799999999997,4009.2799999999997, Yeah.
4009.2799999999997,4010.92," I'm actually playing that now, so I want to go back and read."
4010.92,4012.68, Go take a look at it and see what I said.
4012.68,4017.6," Yeah, it's, I think when those first start coming out, I was assuming that it was for an"
4017.6,4022.3599999999997," increasing prevalence of sort of, you know, do it yourself fan sites and things like that"
4022.3599999999997,4028.3999999999996," where, I mean, I'm not saying that they're easier to buy out or whatever, but I think"
4028.3999999999996,4033.3599999999997," that publishers might assume as much because it's like, hey, I mean, you know, I just"
4033.3599999999997,4034.96, started to cite them.
4034.96,4039.0," I'm super excited to get on, you know, I'm on a press release mailing list."
4039.0,4043.72, Because send me an email every time your game goes gold or every time you get a photo
4043.72,4049.48," taken with a baseball player, you know, wearing a shirt and then you get some free games"
4049.48,4051.48, now and then and then you read it.
4051.48,4055.08," And it's basically they're very, you know, they're definitely written in such a way."
4055.08,4059.6," They, you know, we want you to understand, here's some things that are super important"
4059.6,4065.64," to us, you know, like, and though the, the EA ones will hammer home their catchphrases"
4065.64,4066.64, for every little thing.
4066.72,4070.08," And then how they have got to name something, everything's got some trademark on it."
4070.08,4074.56," And like the black hand, whatever technique or something for Godfather, you know, I was"
4074.56,4077.3599999999997, one that I looked at and laughed at.
4077.3599999999997,4080.24," You got to remember, you know, all this stuff is, you know, we're really trying to do this"
4080.24,4081.24, that and the other thing.
4081.24,4084.8799999999997," And then when you go and read, I've actually read some reviews, not from those fan sites."
4084.8799999999997,4090.48," And they basically read is though, I mean, it could be suspicion, but in my mind, they"
4090.48,4096.2," read is though someone read that and they, they somehow absorb those points and we're"
4096.28,4100.72," like, whatever the thought process was decided that, yeah, I need to like just drive these"
4100.72,4102.44, points home to the same.
4102.44,4103.44, Yeah.
4103.44,4106.8," The very, it's, it's kind of like a last, here's our last attempt."
4106.8,4110.32," It's like blowing a kiss at the judge right after you did your little, your thing, you"
4110.32,4114.2," know, we, I picture a name like, Larry, where you're sitting there without your reviewers"
4114.2,4116.16," guy just gone, these controls are bullshit."
4116.16,4119.8," And then you pick up the rear of the guy and says, our controls are bullshit because"
4119.8,4124.8," you're like, oh, it's got on my status."
4124.8,4130.400000000001," Yeah, and this is like before you go, you know, think of the dumb movie you go into and"
4130.400000000001,4133.88," say, say, you're, you know, you go into whatever Batman."
4133.88,4137.88," And there's some scene where someone falls off cliff and then the guy reaches, this is"
4137.88,4141.4400000000005, in Batman begins and the guy reaches over and grabs his hand just in time.
4141.4400000000005,4144.04," And you're like, dude, is he going to, is he going to pull him up?"
4144.04,4145.28, Is he going to do it?
4145.28,4146.72, What if he drops him?
4146.8,4148.2," Did you know, and you're making fun of that, right?"
4148.2,4152.360000000001," But then what if the guy was like, you know, we found people just love the tension involved"
4152.360000000001,4153.68, in this and that they've sweat.
4153.68,4158.240000000001," We've, you know, we're hooking up electrodes, you've seen a physiological change where they're"
4158.240000000001,4163.2," just, you know, we want you to know this, Chris, before you make fun of that, that people,"
4163.2,4164.6, they get worked up when they're intentional.
4164.6,4165.6, Okay.
4165.6,4166.6, That makes it makes sense.
4166.6,4172.360000000001," There's, I mean, I agree with everything you're saying, I could see where there"
4172.36,4177.0," might be some games where where they probably feel, you know, there's probably some,"
4177.0,4179.48, definitely like blow in the kiss to the judge.
4179.48,4184.0," But there's probably also like, maybe feeling on a developer's part like, especially"
4184.0,4187.799999999999," for, for sites or publications where they know these people are going to just put an hour"
4187.799999999999,4191.5599999999995, to win it where they're desperately trying to get these people who are reviewing their
4191.5599999999995,4195.0, games to actually look at certain things that are in there that if they don't point
4195.0,4197.839999999999," them out to, they won't because the critics are too lazy."
4197.839999999999,4198.839999999999, Right.
4198.839999999999,4202.32," They won't, you know, or where they feel like their game just isn't understood."
4202.32,4206.84," Just do it, or I mean, I totally what Sean just said is totally right that like, here's"
4206.84,4209.24, a justification for why our control sucks so bad.
4209.24,4210.24, There's that.
4210.24,4214.96," But on the other side, you know, reading through the tabularaza one before I toss it into"
4214.96,4219.24," the garbage yesterday, but before I threw it out, I look through it."
4219.24,4224.32," And I saw like, you know, they're actually pointing out some of the more deeper things in"
4224.32,4227.639999999999," the game that if you just did a curse or you look at it, you wouldn't see."
4227.639999999999,4231.44," Well, I'm sure there's, I know there's a sentiment with some, you know, not every developer,"
4231.44,4235.0, but some developers that game reviewers don't get it or are lazy.
4235.0,4238.599999999999," Because I've had some friends who've worked at developers who've said, yeah, the sentiment"
4238.599999999999,4242.679999999999," towards games, press is pretty much like what a bunch of lazy bastards who don't get it."
4242.679999999999,4244.679999999999, So I'm sure that's part of the element too.
4244.679999999999,4248.36," And this isn't, I'm not saying every developer thinks that, but I've heard that sentiment"
4248.36,4249.36, expressed before.
4249.36,4250.36, It's got to be some educated.
4250.36,4252.36," Yeah, they want to educate."
4252.36,4257.0," I understand the desire to do that, but I mean, you just gotta take that with."
4257.0,4258.0, Yeah.
4258.0,4261.36," I mean, it's an opinionated manual in the opinion is written by people who may think,"
4261.36,4262.36, basically.
4262.36,4265.4, The ones that I've read are specifically written in such a way where it's like things
4265.4,4266.4, that everyone would know.
4266.4,4267.4," It's like, yeah."
4267.4,4268.4, Here's our bullet point list.
4268.4,4271.92," These are the things we think that set this game apart, that are, you know, that"
4271.92,4273.799999999999, it's strengths.
4273.799999999999,4276.799999999999," And it's like they're right there so that when it comes time to write, you got that list"
4276.799999999999,4279.2," to go right back to like, hey, this is good."
4279.2,4280.2, This is good.
4280.2,4281.2, This is good.
4281.2,4282.92," And by the way, it's also called this technique."
4282.92,4283.92, Great.
4283.92,4287.4," I usually just use the box, the box itself and the box art."
4287.4,4288.4, Right.
4288.4,4289.719999999999, That's how easy this.
4289.72,4292.12," It's cutting edge 3D, variance."
4292.12,4294.360000000001, We'll blow you away like no other.
4294.360000000001,4296.320000000001, And then I just put my name on it.
4296.320000000001,4298.320000000001, It sounds really good.
4298.320000000001,4299.320000000001, Come on.
4299.320000000001,4300.320000000001, Cool.
4300.320000000001,4304.280000000001," What, what, what, what we get back into the reviews, my way."
4304.280000000001,4305.4400000000005, That's our siren.
4305.4400000000005,4306.72, It just keeps calling us.
4306.72,4307.72, Yeah.
4307.72,4308.72, What?
4308.72,4309.72, The talking about.
4309.72,4310.72, Yeah.
4310.72,4311.72, It's our living.
4311.72,4312.72, It is.
4312.72,4313.72, It is.
4313.72,4314.72, It is.
4314.72,4315.72, It is.
4315.72,4316.72, It is.
4316.72,4317.72, It is.
4317.72,4318.72, It is.
4319.72,4321.72," Hey, then we got to stick that in a few of this month."
4321.72,4323.72, Anyone could put that in their own.
4323.72,4324.72, It's like we're $50 bonus.
4324.72,4326.72, A mixed bag of meat and bread and butter.
4329.72,4330.72, And potatoes.
4330.72,4331.72, Yeah.
4331.72,4333.72, Potatoes come up a lot to you.
4333.72,4336.72," So what, like, what's gaming time?"
4336.72,4341.72," I mean, I can't wait to talk about crisis, but that's going to be another week or so."
4341.72,4342.72, Yeah.
4342.72,4343.72, We're the demo.
4343.72,4344.72, We could talk about that.
4344.72,4347.72," I mean, if you guys been playing, I can't say too much because at this point now,"
4347.72,4349.72, I've played so much of the game.
4349.72,4358.72," Well, I mean, I've played all of crisis once and I'm going through it a second time that it's difficult for me to extricate just the demo experience from everything else."
4358.72,4361.72, It's getting an 11 right out of 10 from us.
4361.72,4365.72," If possible, I'd like so the review guide said that this would be the case."
4365.72,4367.72, It would make sense to do that.
4367.72,4368.72, Yeah.
4368.72,4369.72, To give it an 11 right.
4369.72,4370.72, Any PC game.
4370.72,4371.72, They had a good.
4371.72,4372.72, Yeah.
4372.72,4376.72, They will they basically give me some algorithms that showed me objectively why this game isn't 11.
4376.72,4378.72, They probably looked like a little bit.
4378.72,4382.72," But they said look, we understand sometimes you're like if you'd be subjective and just throw unsacced and it, you know, opinions out there."
4382.72,4384.72," If you wanted to do that, go ahead otherwise."
4384.72,4386.72, There's a few that you might get away with.
4386.72,4387.72, Right.
4387.72,4391.72," Well, we've given tens to games that are less than perfect because a 10, we're saying,"
4391.72,4394.72," we're saying overall, the experience is a 10."
4394.72,4396.72," Yes, of no game could ever be perfect."
4396.72,4397.72, Right.
4397.72,4400.72," So if you were going to only give a perfect game a 10, no game would ever get a 10."
4400.72,4404.72," So we're saying in general, on a curve, this game is a 10."
4404.72,4408.64, this game is a 10. So I think that sets us up for giving crisis in 11.
4408.64,4412.04," Yeah. I was like, where are we going with this?"
4412.04,4416.96, I'm just preemptively. I'm saying I'm giving you the clearance to give in 11.
4416.96,4420.96, Yeah. That's what I'm going. I would have done it if you didn't get it.
4420.96,4424.8," If you didn't get it, clearance. I would have went back in the document before we went to the"
4424.8,4429.4400000000005, sooner. Maybe crisis gets the 11 because then Starcraft 2 is going to get the 12.
4429.4400000000005,4433.2, We're going to declare by 2 now. Don't assume this is all just tongue and cheek. Don't
4433.2,4437.5199999999995," assume that we are saying if we could give it a lie, I'm not saying either way."
4437.5199999999995,4442.72, Crisis mic and I'm not for all we know. We can totally joking. The entire tire range is there.
4442.72,4445.599999999999, You guys play the demo? I'm just waiting for the real thing.
4447.599999999999,4451.2, Is it totally separate from Lee? Is it a third game or is it like a chunk of it?
4451.2,4457.12," We got Darren off my asking. No, not okay. I'm just at re-askin it for those who can't hear."
4457.12,4460.08, The demo is dancing for when the demo goes up to.
4460.24,4462.96, The demo is of the sliver of the very first level.
4464.8,4469.12, I'm just waiting. I don't even play it. I haven't even bothered trying to have them played the demo.
4469.68,4473.92," I'm also in a situation where I'm playing something. It's kind of one of those great demos,"
4473.92,4480.0," though, even any slice of that game where you can play it again and getware for me."
4480.0,4484.48," The single player called duty 4 demo was like, play it once and that was it. No interest to play that again."
4484.48,4488.48, It's very much through. Here's the tram tour. You took it. You're good to go.
4489.44,4491.44," When you have another kid, you can come back and write it again."
4492.639999999999,4496.32, The crisis one is there's just so much that you could do.
4496.32,4502.0, I've compared it demo-wise to one of the classic demos. The middle of your solitude one.
4502.0,4506.0," You can play it. You can get a lot of mileage out of it. Part of it was just looking at like, wow,"
4506.0,4509.679999999999, look how good this looks. I don't know which I have this game but I'm going to try this and that.
4509.679999999999,4515.28, Maybe there's some secrets in it. I think it gives a pretty good fair indication of what the
4515.28,4520.4," part of the game is like. I mean, I just watched Derr and play it. My PC home has no chance of"
4520.4,4528.0," keeping up. It just made me think, you know, from a console perspective, that engine is so amazing."
4528.0,4533.759999999999, All the different genres even that engine could be used for. Such an incredibly detailed
4533.759999999999,4537.28, lush world of waterfalls and all of that. Like an oblivion or something like that would just-
4537.28,4545.2, I keep thinking of golf soon. Derr and Spassonaut about the top. That just fucking died.
4545.28,4554.639999999999, Sorry. I didn't hear. I was going to talk about the DX10.
4554.639999999999,4556.639999999999, We don't have a mic.
4556.639999999999,4559.44, There's another mic.
4559.44,4565.44, I could step out. The reason I want to talk about that Derr and this because it was off the record.
4567.84,4570.719999999999, We got an off the record thing. We're not going to talk about it.
4571.04,4575.84," So yeah. The engine would work well with so many things, I believe."
4576.64,4583.92, Yeah. It's just incredible. It's kind of a pipe dream. You look at the way the Zelda series is
4583.92,4588.4800000000005, gone. They've experimented with different graphics. They're version of the more realistic Zelda
4588.4800000000005,4594.88, is still on basically GameCube Hardware. The world still looks fine. But the potential with
4594.88,4598.320000000001, that kind of engine with such an incredible forest environment and all that.
4598.48,4602.88," For especially, I think like horror stuff too. Or just for anything with tension because when"
4602.88,4608.16, the environment is so natural and it's so easy to feel like you're in it. Right. That it seems like
4608.16,4613.04, it's all the more easier to scare you. Yeah. And do things like that. Yeah. There's so many.
4613.04,4617.2, Because there really are time. I can't talk about it. It's embargoed. But yeah. Okay.
4618.0,4624.16," But even in that level though, even in that demo level, it is there sections where it seems"
4624.48,4630.08," so naturalistic that you can say what if you did this that, you know, it would be"
4630.8,4634.639999999999, yeah. I guess next week of Sean is wearing a crisis t-shirt one now.
4635.5199999999995,4639.44, Let it in. Let me stop. Why are you saying that? I already gave you my excuse.
4640.48,4645.28," I gave, they gave me some shirt and I was like, the one time I took them does like they have cool illustrations."
4645.28,4649.36," This cool shirt. For the comic listeners out here, the looks like it was modeled on"
4649.36,4653.44," Billson Kavitch. Who's one of my favorite. I mean, I know he didn't do it. Another one maybe"
4653.44,4657.5199999999995, little bit of Paul Pope in there. Then it will straight. You don't have to be defensive. Yeah.
4657.5199999999995,4662.48, Yeah. It's not just like a Mario game industry swag. Come on man.
4663.92,4669.5199999999995," That's an extra. But let's get back to comic books. You know, here's something we"
4669.5199999999995,4673.679999999999, don't know about. We're just going to Spider-Man. Yeah. We can talk about that.
4673.679999999999,4678.0," And we can also like, I mean, if you got any, you know, people, last time we talked about books,"
4678.08,4681.68, we were reading in general. People liked it. We could talk about if we have any comics to recommend.
4683.68,4688.16, We do a lot of making fun of comics and haven't talked so much about the ones that we think are worth reading.
4688.16,4691.36, I'm not reading any. My fist though. Reading in the comics. Reading books.
4692.48,4697.12," Yeah, I'm reading books. But I probably recommended this. I read, I've been reading the same books since August."
4697.12,4704.08," He that me fist or told you, he went to Jeff Green and said, I will give you 40 bucks more a month in your bank account."
4704.64,4709.68," But you can't read comics. Or you can never have married your day one yet, Dammit."
4710.24,4715.44, I'm done with comics for at this point in my life. Not forever. Right now I'm on a more time.
4715.44,4720.16, You could read him at the bill of Bruce Springfield. Bruce Springfield.
4722.16,4726.24, What's wrong with the use of today? Bruce Springfield. I could tell you something an old
4726.24,4731.68, full of springfield. Why that's though. You got in the Bruce Springfield concert. How was it?
4732.64,4737.84," It was like no old person could pronounce anything right. That's always like, I'm always like,"
4737.84,4741.92," I don't know what I want online service uses now, but she'll always call it Comp you saved."
4741.92,4744.4800000000005," Until the day she died. Oh, I'm on Comp you saved."
4746.96,4751.68," First of all, it was Comp you served. But it doesn't matter because she wants something totally different."
4751.68,4756.96," Yeah, but that's all right. I'm already getting that point then because I always say Walgreens when it's"
4757.04,4759.36, right-aid or I say right-aid when it's Walgreens or
4760.56,4765.84," you know, that's totally forgivable. I think we ever tell the story of Chief Pemikhan."
4767.28,4772.72," I think we did. Yeah. Fucking Chief. Yeah, you can tell it anymore. They have accidentally"
4772.72,4781.52, customer service. It's all over. There are beef drinkers smells like garbage. What beef jerky doesn't smell
4781.52,4785.52, like garbage. That's true. Some of it looks like shit. Some smells like shit.
4785.6,4790.400000000001," Some of it is good when you get the two together. But it was like, yeah, like the Chief Pemikhan"
4790.96,4793.68, fucking we don't have to tell the story again. We can still talk about it.
4794.56,4798.96, There's no one to tell me I can't. That stuff smelled so bad. It was like you could leave it in
4798.96,4803.200000000001, someone's car or you'd or see if you wanted to fuck with them. And then they'd get their car
4803.200000000001,4807.76," just like be looking for like the dead's bro or something. Man, you totally just reminded me. I've got"
4808.72,4814.240000000001," yesterday we went to Chipotle. This Mexican joint. Let's send it to the car. Yeah, no, I left. I didn't finish"
4814.24,4817.5199999999995, my burrito. So I took it. I was going to take it home to eat last night for dinner. It's still
4817.5199999999995,4826.4," sitting in my backpack. Oh, it's burrito still. Oh, God. Yeah, probably want to sign up in my office."
4826.4,4832.16," It's not the call in there. It's like this, like I think it was from going swimming in a river or"
4832.16,4835.76," something in a hand. These shoes, these sneakers that by the time they dry, they smelled like"
4835.76,4840.48," so wicked. And I think we took those and shoved them under the seat, under the seat of my friends"
4840.48,4844.879999999999, car when we went somewhere. And I got a quick way back in the whole thing was just saturated.
4844.879999999999,4849.599999999999, Food and we hate on this floor here that I could put my burrito under their under their chair for the rest of the day here.
4850.5599999999995,4857.5199999999995," How about garnet it? What? You're on one of yours. I got a surprise coming for you,"
4857.5199999999995,4864.5599999999995, God. That's because we thought the man. He called us rabble. So he called us rabble. So he's getting there.
4864.5599999999995,4868.639999999999, Get him lunch. He's got my yeah. The surprise waiting for you. One up yours.
4868.72,4873.6, Have some landfill. That's right. rabble. rabble. Can't help it.
4873.6,4880.72," Rabble feedsy dirty burritos. I think we fit bottom. No, we haven't even tied. I brought a"
4880.72,4886.96, talk about comic books. But the problem here is the problem here. The problem here is that we thought we had a
4886.96,4893.04," one o'clock stop. It's now on 25 and there's still nobody coming in here. So we're sort of, we're"
4893.04,4898.88, like they might have wandered to another room. That's fine. So we're sort of lost here. We just keep talking.
4898.88,4904.24, What about this? We've got nothing to talk about. We're crisp in a view of you. We're walking dead yet.
4905.36,4909.04, I read that. I'm going to you and set a Jeff because Jeff are saying. That's the comments. I don't
4909.04,4913.36," read comics. Well, this might. I read the others on these series that you there was out of"
4913.36,4916.88," while I go wait was that walking dead were they went up in a prison? Yeah, and it's still going."
4916.88,4922.16, Okay. It's zombies in prison. No. I'm sorry. I heard you wrong.
4922.24,4925.36," But that's a great series. Yeah. I was thinking about this. I was like, I don't"
4926.16,4928.72," all the books because I went about books last week and I was like, I got, um,"
4930.0,4940.88," walking dead, plated the immortal, new vagabond collection and 100 bullets and powers. And of all those,"
4940.88,4945.68," there's another one. X-mocking. And of all those books, it's like, powers is the one that's got a"
4945.68,4950.96, super here type thing in it. But it's not really about that. It's about detective's who investigate
4951.04,4956.56, crimes involving. It's still going. It's still going. It's still going. It's still going. It's still going.
4956.56,4960.8, It's like actually been going places to further. It doesn't mention everyone's. I stopped reading
4960.8,4965.2," like a year ago, but just because like wait, it's 100. It's still going. It's still going. Yeah."
4965.2,4970.8," Wow. I think we've been around like 87. Huh. It's um, same writers on all those books."
4970.8,4974.72," Yeah, the same team. That's the other. That's about all those books. Yeah. All the books I've mentioned"
4974.72,4979.12, are definitely it's like either one person or it's the same team. And it's been that way.
4979.12,4983.68," Power still. Yes. Dennis and however you pronounce the other guy, OEM, IG."
4986.4,4992.16, Yeah. I'm not sure what happens with that. Karnega. Is it like Ermig or something?
4992.16,4998.64, No. Okay. It's like yelling. Cardic loop. You excited about that one in movie?
4998.64,5005.599999999999," That's coming out based on that. Oh, God. I just heard about that. But let's not talk about that anymore."
5005.76,5010.56, Why? It's like we was something Mark Miller's involved in. He doesn't need any of our
5011.120000000001,5015.84, Ryan's apartment. Mark Mark Molar. You got a prince named Michael Miller. Bitch.
5015.84,5023.360000000001, I heard the guy from now. Yeah. It's a Mark Miller. It's comic writer. And he did the
5023.360000000001,5030.160000000001," ultimate, which all the ultimate. Not ultimate Spider-Man or all the next man or am I allowed to say"
5030.160000000001,5034.4800000000005, that series was full. I thought it was fantastic. That's like a super hero. That's like a
5035.44,5040.639999999999, so what's from what's Ryan's problem? Hate something. Did dude's the biggest like self-congratatory
5040.639999999999,5045.36," do-bag in the entire comics industry? See, I don't know that side of him. I just know his comics."
5045.36,5049.12, That's the big guy. Are you trying to be his friend? Are you trying to read his comic book?
5049.12,5055.2," I'm like, why just don't people say the same thing about Vince Gallo. I love Buffalo 66."
5055.2,5062.0," If the mislike piece of shit, right? But like, like again, I'm not like trying to kick it with the guy."
5062.0,5065.68, I'm not like trying to be his best friend. Like he made a great movie. There's maybe
5065.68,5070.88," homie, right? It's good comic books. So Mark Miller wrote Superman Red Sun, which is like this"
5071.44,5075.44," Elf World, like alternate reality, like what if Superman's story? It's probably the best Superman"
5075.44,5081.6," story I've ever read. Okay, look at that. So I can't deny that. He probably ran you from his message"
5081.6,5086.56," word form dude. Oh, I hate man. He from his message word form because I was right. He did do it. Oh,"
5086.56,5093.84," he's shit. Oh, he's a fucking boy. Oh, he goes. Yes, dude. Okay. Break out the shrooms."
5093.84,5098.56," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Okay, so now you've wrote me into talking about Mark Miller."
5098.56,5107.120000000001," Let me clarify my antagonistic relationship with Vince Gallo. My, my best friend owns, you know, a"
5107.120000000001,5112.56," comic book store. He's all the conicals, nice and smart. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And he'll always,"
5112.56,5116.72," he'll always like, like Mark Miller always be getting on his boards and my post and like,"
5116.72,5121.6," Hey, guys, but you know, whatever, whatever thing he's into or wants to do or whatever stupid"
5121.6,5126.240000000001, ass idea he's got. And my friend will like show me these posts because he knows it pushes my buttons
5126.240000000001,5130.88," because like I get so goddamn annoyed at this guy and like all, you know, I would have"
5130.88,5135.52, and have really always go in and just like totally mock him to his face and like for a year.
5135.52,5140.240000000001," Two days like one, two days as avatar. His avatar is as face. What do you mean?"
5140.96,5146.08," As much to the stages, you can't get on the internet on his own message board, you know, and like after a year"
5146.08,5152.32," of this, they finally wise up and then booted me out. Just starting up the pot. Yeah, because it's all I ever really did."
5153.12,5159.36," You're just a troll. No, you're pretty much a troll. But like I called you the guy so much comic book for a troll from though."
5159.36,5165.92," The other, okay, so like, how about how about like last week? This is a perfect example of what what a jerk this guy is."
5166.4,5174.56," Like why can't a standing? But like I'm with you man. Files guy. Yeah, so that there's some you know a Superman movie sequel"
5176.16,5179.52, in the works. What? And that failed piece of shit.
5181.52,5187.76," Did that with did that fail? Yeah. I mean, I don't know what I'm performing as expected. I didn't see it."
5187.76,5193.6," I don't know if it's considered a fair. I had everything but a story. I mean, they had the the right look for"
5193.6,5198.64," Superman and right. It was kind of I mean, they had a bad lowest lane, but it's just like nothing really happened and the"
5198.64,5208.56," Superman was kind of weird. Yeah. Yeah, but anyway, so like it was announced that you know the writers who wrote the"
5209.280000000001,5213.280000000001," Who wrote Superman turns aren't coming back to the sequel, which he only did. That's a good thing whenever."
5213.92,5220.4800000000005," But then, but then Mark Miller, he got went to this and he started just like going off of that. How like oh my god. I'm gonna"
5221.04,5227.839999999999, I want to write this movie. I was born to to revamp Superman. That's why I was given typing fingers and he starts going on this
5227.839999999999,5234.799999999999, whole tirade about he's gonna how he's gonna get in contact with DC and offered to do this movie for free and all this stuff and like like he
5235.2,5237.2, He has some kind of right to do it. It's just like
5238.16,5239.2, I
5239.2,5241.2, Feel you
5242.639999999999,5246.959999999999," Well, it's just like the way he goes about it like oh, I'm the best person to do this"
5246.96,5251.6," What if his movies really good? Yeah, and he doesn't feel like he has the same in the movie. We'll"
5251.6,5259.6," They've already told him now, but I think he did the best like straightforward superhero story that Mark was published in you know 20 years and that"
5259.6,5265.12," The ultimate yeah, and that's like kind of a gateway comic because you turn that you like how a lot of people are reading and a lot of people"
5265.12,5269.44," Everyone shoot. Yeah, everyone you give that to who's got even a passing interest in it"
5269.44,5271.44, It will totally like it and the thing is is it's so
5271.84,5275.52, Because it works on the level of the characters as people. I mean you hear this all the time
5275.52,5279.120000000001, But most of the time when I hear it cited like for in the case of Spider-Man or X-Men
5279.360000000001,5282.64, Fantastic four I mean that was the premise of that is a family at same time
5282.96,5285.68, But they just like it hasn't worked that way and so long instead
5285.68,5289.040000000001, It's just this non-stop parade of just random villains and
5289.68,5291.68, People in space not dumbass
5292.080000000001,5294.080000000001, Halloween spirit super story outfits that
5295.6,5297.6, You know
5298.96,5303.040000000001, They gave me this thing we're instead of having to stay in the street in the sandwich board that says spirit Halloween
5303.040000000001,5304.72, I just keep mentioning it on the podcast
5305.280000000001,5306.8," Okay, so anyway, right?"
5306.8,5307.76, So
5308.56,5309.4400000000005, But
5309.4400000000005,5315.360000000001," Your man, well Ryan you're mad because he he thought he couldn't he he thinks he can write a good script for a superman movie"
5315.360000000001,5317.84, I don't like it. What a fucker. I don't like it
5318.72,5320.72, He's shit
5321.12,5322.72, That dude has no humility
5323.04,5328.240000000001," God damn it. Okay, that's why and now your band from his his son and band from his side for a long time"
5328.56,5332.64, But so that's why you'd never read his book although you're trying to pass to me
5333.04,5339.200000000001," Hold on dude, you know what all the three of you say this before you say it okay? I hopefully admit like I have the first volume of"
5339.200000000001,5343.280000000001, Ultimate sitting on my bookshelf on your recommendation that I haven't read yet just cuz
5343.92,5348.64, I'll get into comment book reading mode sometimes other times I won't but I plan on reading that at some point
5348.8,5352.4800000000005," So it'll just be national your teeth. Oh, this is good, but fuck this guy"
5352.48,5354.48," Yes, I know it"
5356.0,5358.0, Nervous guy
5358.0,5360.0, Great
5360.0,5365.679999999999," Interesting biases against certain writers. Yeah, yeah big digs right. Like Carl and Ellison"
5366.08,5369.759999999999," I just know from everything I've heard that he is yeah asshole, so I'm just like"
5370.08,5371.5199999999995, You know what I don't want to give him any money
5372.32,5374.32," Yeah, no, it's classic stories that I know what the great"
5375.04,5378.879999999999, But Ryan hasn't read you have that trade payback and you haven't read it bit in the meantime
5379.04,5381.839999999999, You're trying to pass me this book called booster gold
5382.08,5385.84, Now wait now let now it's my turn to say this okay this I opened it up
5386.08,5389.12, I had heard of this guy before but I didn't really I hadn't really heard of him
5389.12,5394.32, Heard them so I look at this shit and it's a football play. It's a fucking football player from the future
5394.72,5402.88, Who comes back in time to play football in the in the present or to make bets on football or some shit and he's wearing like a gold leotard
5403.2,5409.52," Okay, and he's like right he's ripped in this like onesy unitarred sitting there in this page I opened it up"
5409.76,5414.72, And he's playing he's playing Xbox he's holding the controller in this dumbass outfit
5414.72,5418.0," There's like he's still posing like he's in the freaking like open, you know"
5418.72,5424.080000000001, Like holding the controller like that and then so I pointed out I'm like look there's a bunch of word bubbles on this page
5424.320000000001,5431.4400000000005, Like but there's nothing no human or computer or anything can produce to fill in these bubbles to make this page to salvage this page
5432.240000000001,5434.56, Like there's nothing you can do to fix the shit down
5435.52,5439.6, And then you gave me that dude and every page you flip through it looks like that shit
5439.6,5441.360000000001, Is someone he's just posing then?
5441.360000000001,5446.8," It's just like like white squad, you know like someone went through like bodybuilder ripped monthly and drew like a"
5447.6,5451.84, Gold leotard on the dudes and then put some bubbles in he's talking about yeah football
5451.84,5453.84, He ain't like it. It isn't a future
5453.84,5459.84," If you're trying to give me that right, but you still won't read you still won't read the ultimate"
5461.200000000001,5463.92, That's why that's why I like Mike Malar
5464.24,5470.56," So it's Martin. Here's him. Oh my, Gepisode. Yeah, so fiery golden it's yo Yo Yo"
5471.36,5475.52, I'll try to read I'll try to read that whole thing but seriously when I looked at that
5475.52,5480.56, That's the kind of thing where if you're in the bathroom right and it's you're into the Long Paul
5481.4400000000005,5488.4, And you've got no you've got this a bottle of baby powder. It's got some you know like instructions and prohibitions about
5488.4,5489.6, You son it you could read that
5490.24,5493.84, You got the toothpaste. All right. I got booster gold. I would probably get a few pages into
5493.84,5495.84, a booster goal and pick up the baby powder.
5495.84,5497.84, That's not fair.
5497.84,5498.84, That's no joke.
5498.84,5501.84," Like if it was on TV, I would turn a channel and if like it."
5501.84,5503.84, Why do you like this kind of baby powder?
5503.84,5505.84, In indifense of booster goal.
5505.84,5508.84, Don't judge a superhero comic by the Leotard.
5508.84,5511.84, The goofy ass like description that Sean gave of the character.
5511.84,5512.84, Yeah.
5512.84,5513.84, More of a mess.
5513.84,5514.84, That's accurate.
5514.84,5516.84," But like the whole thing,"
5516.84,5518.84," the whole premise of this comic is that this,"
5518.84,5521.84, this is like this absurd character with this absurd backstory
5522.84,5524.84, who just wants to be famous and get rich.
5524.84,5527.84," Like he, his whole, like the whole concept of his ridiculous,"
5527.84,5529.84, like this whole costume is like a fairy.
5529.84,5531.84," It's kind of, yeah."
5531.84,5533.84," But it's kind of, he's a parody of a..."
5533.84,5534.84, That's a weird idea.
5534.84,5535.84, That's a weird idea.
5535.84,5536.84, That's a weird idea.
5536.84,5537.84," It's kind of, it's kind of not."
5537.84,5538.84, It kind of is.
5538.84,5539.84, It's kind of not.
5539.84,5541.84, That's when I was trying to read it.
5541.84,5542.84," And like what I was reading,"
5542.84,5546.84, I was reading a flaming carrot instead if you want to parody of a comic book here.
5546.84,5548.84, You guys know flaming carrot?
5548.84,5550.84," Read no, read ultimate character or read it."
5550.84,5553.84, Or read flaming worlds toughest milkman.
5553.84,5554.84, In the other comic.
5554.84,5555.84, Nothing in one.
5555.84,5558.84, I'm just passing on Bruce Oldspirlo.
5558.84,5559.84, Springfield do that one.
5559.84,5561.84, Yeah.
5561.84,5563.84, With Jeff Rattal.
5563.84,5566.84, The ultimate's had an annual though.
5566.84,5567.84," You're at that, right?"
5567.84,5568.84, You can shine in Chrisman.
5568.84,5569.84, The ultimate's annual?
5569.84,5570.84, I don't know.
5570.84,5571.84, I believe so.
5571.84,5572.84, And they're putting together this team.
5572.84,5575.84, It's like the new defenders or dumb stuff.
5575.84,5577.84, And that was a parody of superheroes.
5577.84,5579.84, To the point where it was just some fools.
5579.84,5580.84, You couldn't tell what it was.
5580.84,5582.84, And there's this one guy.
5582.84,5583.84, It was Ant Man.
5583.84,5584.84, And he's stupid too.
5584.84,5586.84, It's like a guy who can make himself shrink and grow.
5586.84,5588.84, And he could talk to Ants when he shrinks.
5588.84,5589.84, And so he gets cool.
5589.84,5590.84, He's just like a loser.
5590.84,5597.84, I was all bummed out because Captain America like the 50 40s beefcake is tapping his ex-wife.
5597.84,5599.84, And so he goes and he finds these kids doing this.
5599.84,5600.84, They want to make a hero team.
5600.84,5603.84," And like he's, you know, he's tapping this one chick."
5603.84,5605.84," And she's like, you got to wear the kid."
5605.84,5607.84, But she makes him wear a Captain America costume to do it.
5607.84,5611.84, Even though he's like with this team because he's like got shunned by Captain America.
5611.84,5614.84, He goes out and they try to do their first big bust.
5614.84,5616.84, And like one of the dudes is in a wheelchair.
5616.84,5619.84, And they had the wheelchair strapped on the top of this like rental car that they have.
5619.84,5621.84, It's like their hero mobile.
5621.84,5623.84, They get to like the warehouse.
5623.84,5625.84, And it's like they heard about they got this tip off.
5625.84,5629.84," And it's some kids trying to steal cigarettes from a shipment from like some like bowie,"
5629.84,5630.84, town or something.
5630.84,5635.84," And then then he, he, the Ant Man freaks out and he goes giant."
5635.84,5639.84, And it rips his clothes off and then like all these tablets take pictures of his unit.
5639.84,5642.84," And then that goes on the, that goes on the news."
5642.84,5644.84, Like that's a good parody.
5644.84,5646.84, That's a good parody of a superhero.
5646.84,5649.84, There was a book that that came out a while back.
5649.84,5654.84," It's very, very similar sounds like in Tom and it's called formerly known as the Justice League."
5654.84,5655.84, Hmm.
5655.84,5656.84, Is it have?
5656.84,5660.84," And it's about all these like a sea list characters who, you know,"
5660.84,5662.84, they formed together their own like little super team.
5662.84,5664.84, But they're all a bunch of like dumb characters.
5664.84,5665.84, Yeah.
5665.84,5667.84," You know, similar sorts of winter twins."
5667.84,5668.84," And they're, Glee."
5668.84,5669.84," No, no, no."
5669.84,5671.84," Glee, is it Glee or Gleepe?"
5671.84,5672.84, That was Gleepe.
5672.84,5673.84, I think it's Gleepe.
5673.84,5677.84," Because Gleeking is when that's like a little bit of spit from your,"
5677.84,5678.84," Is that way, does?"
5678.84,5680.84," It's from your spit, does."
5680.84,5682.84, I'm pulling the plug.
5682.84,5685.84, I'm pulling the plug.
5685.84,5686.84," I'm pulling, I'm pulling, I'm pulling."
5686.84,5689.84," And if this last 40 minutes makes it in without being edited,"
5689.84,5691.84, I apologize to the readers.
5691.84,5692.84, We're almost out of tape.
5692.84,5693.84, Yeah.
5693.84,5696.84, This is the extra expanded late edition.
5696.84,5698.84," Oh, we never did a podcast for being late this week."
5698.84,5699.84, Because they're second week in a row of things.
5699.84,5700.84," Yeah, we'll be back."
5700.84,5702.84, We'll be back on track.
