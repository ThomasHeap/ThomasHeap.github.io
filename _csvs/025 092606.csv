0.0,8.24," Hello and welcome once again to the C.D. W Radio podcast. This is the podcast for September 26, 2006"
9.6,16.4, We are back. We took a week off last week because we were under extreme direct deadline for getting the last C.D. W at the door
16.72,18.400000000000002, But it is out the door
18.400000000000002,24.48," We are still C.D. W radio for now. We are not GFW radio, but at some point we're gonna have to make that painful switch."
24.48,26.48, This looks like an airport though
26.48,34.24," Yes W yeah, we've got embrace it at this point at some point we do but for right now today we are the C.D. W radio podcast. God dammit"
34.96,41.92," And with me today are the C.D. W editors which are as follows. Ryan Scott, Darren Gladstone,"
41.92,49.84," Sean Elliott and Sean Maloy. Welcome, gentlemen. Once again we've been scattered across the the four corners of the earth for a while"
49.84,57.040000000000006, but we're all back. Good to see you all. Sean is back from Japan. Sean Elliott that is I have to say
57.040000000000006,63.68000000000001, MCs last names. Jet lagged and sick but ready to talk about some half life two survivor arcade.
64.32000000000001,68.96000000000001," Excellent. Yeah, and you got a teaser. We can't show that card you got on the"
68.96000000000001,73.2," Yeah, I could pass you to talk about it. Well, it's really odd what you got. You just can pass this around."
73.2,78.72," Yeah, basically what's going around now is a memory card for the game for the arcade game."
78.8,85.2, So when you go in and play it like if you want to do a single player game which is basically half life two as we know it
85.2,90.8, but not as we know it and you get the card for like 200 again and then that will allow you to come back and
90.8,94.72, and you know resume play just as if you had been doing it from a home PC.
95.36,100.64," Wait, you could resume play from where you were. Yeah, yeah. Wow. So yeah, so say if you get halfway through"
100.64,105.75999999999999," you know whatever, no, we're prospecting a couple games and you come back then you come back the next day with some more money and finish it."
105.84,110.32000000000001," You know, I think I remember like didn't say I use one of these cards in their arcade games for"
110.32000000000001,114.64," yeah, they have zero or something. Yeah tons of arcade games there including I think like the Mario"
114.64,121.52000000000001, Cart racing and whatnot have these cards these memory cards form and so what does it find a card to just
121.52000000000001,126.16000000000001, give me credits to play it and then the only after it started asking me for more money that I realized that I
126.16000000000001,133.92000000000002, kind of screwed up got myself a souvenir but so the quick skating on this game is it's basically half life two
134.07999999999998,140.23999999999998, but instead of a mouse and keyboard and you know Japanese are traditionally you know FPS foe bake.
140.23999999999998,146.23999999999998, You've got two foot pedals one for crouch one for jump your left hand control stick is the left right
146.23999999999998,152.56, up down you know back forward left and right movement or you know WSD and then your right stick is like a
152.56,158.32, hand controller that then becomes your mouse and it's got a scroll wheel on it and a trigger like
158.4,164.07999999999998, it was a flight thing and then you use the two together so you know move your left hand forward to move forward
164.07999999999998,169.76, and then look around with this stick as if it were a mouse back and it's not very it's pretty intuitive
169.76,173.68, I mean you can figure out as soon as you sit down and start playing and you're just sitting there like jumping with one
173.68,179.68, thing and no looking around but it's definitely not as accurate or as precise and the other thing about this
179.68,184.0, game is hilarious is that of course they're they're abbreviating by taking out you know they're taking out
184.08,187.84, you're not going to be in the arcade and wandering through the very first section of the game and
187.84,191.44, getting off the trains and hitting Barney in the room and finding out that he's you know
192.56,198.56, disguises a combine guy so they just immediately cuts to right after that and it gives you a crowbar
198.56,203.6, and a gun but it's the same game but then what they do is because they have no faith in their audience
203.6,209.76, as a buildy to negotiate these environments or figure out okay that's a dead end I shouldn't sit here
209.76,213.76, for another hour and beat this wall the crowbar I should probably go down that hall and if that door
213.76,219.84, is open I probably should go in there so every step of the way there's a giant illuminated arrow telling
219.84,224.39999999999998, you where to go or there's a crate telling you to beat on this crate or if there's an enemy shooting
224.39999999999998,229.44, at you in the face a big highlight in the arrow pointing at him like this dude right here you do not want to
229.44,234.39999999999998, beat this guy's friend shoot him so I mean it's like so we're just you know yeah it's like time crisis
234.39999999999998,239.28, and then a helicopter comes down and you know this is all familiar experiences we played we know
239.36,243.28, where the helicopters come in and have life and you definitely know it's like crap your pants moment
243.28,247.36, you get some cover but here it's reminding you yet again that that big thing flying and shooting
247.36,252.72, however many rounds a second of you is is to be shot at so the game and the game's already a Disney
252.72,257.2, land ride to start with right basically like it's funny you want to do yeah so if you take out
257.2,261.6, all of the stuff that valve is known for is in terms of like creating the Disney land ride and then
261.6,266.96, masking it you know you're going in and trying to make it so it seems that your eye movements
267.03999999999996,271.12, corrected by very organic things by composition and things like that rather than
271.12,275.59999999999997, and so taking all that work went just putting in the arrows and showing here is the Disney
275.59999999999997,281.12, land ride and has always been there the game is loses a whole lot because of it but is it but I mean
281.12,285.52, people are sitting there I mean you're in public playing it in arcade and are you paying by
285.52,291.12, is it paying by the minute or no no you pay by I think what happens is you get a certain
291.12,293.84, amount you know because obviously you can get health in the game and stuff the same way you're
293.84,297.84, used to and I never died it was just so easy for me but I mean I know the game you know back
297.84,303.11999999999995, my hand but after I played a certain number of levels then it was like time for more money you know
303.11999999999995,307.03999999999996, okay so after I was like I got through the canals that wanted me to put more money and
307.03999999999996,312.79999999999995, taking a link which was interesting and then it's got and then it's got a big multiplayer component
312.79999999999995,317.28, to it and this is interesting because all the character they created new character model so there's
317.28,321.76, like a Gordon and then there's like a female Gordon too and she's in her armor and so it's not
321.76,326.08, Alex or anything it's like a big with big you know big breasts but the half suit on the
326.08,337.44, golden face no but it's like a female version she has a pair too combine the combine assassins
337.44,341.28, the guys with the one eye the white outfits there's female versions of them there's female versions
341.28,345.59999999999997, of the police there's all these other random ones that they made guys with these big backpacks
345.59999999999997,350.88, and they all have like a female version too and you run around and play death match
350.96,355.04, in these linked units through that and the surprising thing was a lot of people are actually playing
355.04,359.84, this game I thought there you'd go and it's gonna be because like they're 360 you go and all the
359.84,364.48, game stores I went through there they had these big kios out front and people gather around in
364.48,368.88, public to play them but there's always a 360 one and had some brand new game I never even heard of
368.88,373.84, it's not out here and no one would touch it it was always every single store was the vacant
373.84,378.0, whereas all the PlayStation 2 games for some the the cheesies look in tennis game or something
378.48,382.56, there'd be like 20 people playing that thing that's brutal so it surprised me that they were
382.56,386.96, willing to play half-life two survivor in the arcade when they're all these other sort of
386.96,390.96, Japan native games around them probably made more sense to a lot of people there and they really
390.96,395.92, it I mean it general just an Xbox phobia kind of thing or I don't just but the think of it too
395.92,401.04, I mean the first person shooters not has I mean the closest analog there is the King's field games
401.04,406.0, which are like dungeon crops I can imagine if you took a believe in you made it a thousand times slower
406.08,411.12, right and it's like I'm really playing it already so possible it is yeah it's a lot of stuff
411.12,416.56, Kingsfield game yeah you can you cannot do one it's real time but you do a one sorts slash every two
416.56,422.48, minutes or something wind up for it and you better hope yes why it's yeah the PS one stuff so
422.48,428.24, do you know valv made any part of this or is the like just kind of handed over to a third party to add all this stuff
428.24,433.68, I don't know I think they may be title publishes it and I'm guessing it was them unless
433.76,439.04, because I can't imagine valv being of all the places that they they're making money and they can and do make money
439.68,443.68, that just doesn't seem like a a big place where they're like you know this is going to be a really
443.68,448.48, wise investment and I can't imagine them wanting to do that kind of violence to their own game just
448.48,454.0, so when else we'll get it you know and I mean I can imagine them wanting to test it themselves and
454.0,459.2, everything so I'm just guessing they gave it made some agreements and hey go ahead at the worst this is just
459.2,464.8, you know introduce some characters and stuff to this new market I'll be in this weird context
464.8,469.84, but it is funny because the other games there in the same arcade they had this a dog walking simulator
469.84,474.24, dogs are all the rage they're real like real small like you know you know the ten dog stuff
474.24,478.48, yeah you go there makes sense because everyone has those kind of dogs that are from the game
478.48,483.68, and you can actually rent dogs like you go out and there's this dog store and it's like we rent dog
483.68,488.71999999999997, you know it's like dog rental right and fun and so you just you get in the line and there's all these
488.72,492.88000000000005, people and you just they show you you know here here's a bat here the bags to pick up it's poo
492.88000000000005,496.32000000000005, and this is what you do and I was watching through the window all the families are getting them
496.32000000000005,501.20000000000005, and you get the dog and you you rent it for a couple hours and just walk around. Wow yeah but so anyway
501.20000000000005,505.12, and so in keeping with dogs to pick up. You keep being with that theme they got the dog of
505.12,509.36, a dog is just huge there so they get this game and it's basically a treadmill for you to
509.36,514.8000000000001, to walk on and you hold a leash and what's happening is that you pick a various you know you pick
515.3599999999999,518.8, all the different dog breeds that you want to walk you know whatever so we picked this poo to
519.1999999999999,522.64, and we're going to go walk it and you're on this treadmill basically you're trying to steer
522.64,527.28, because it wants to go pee places where it shouldn't it wants to chase cats it wants to you know chase
527.28,531.68, mailman and whatever but so you're trying to struggle to keep this thing going and it's what you're
531.68,537.1999999999999, holding on to like a onto a leash controller sort of a leash that's attached to a controller yeah
537.1999999999999,541.3599999999999, okay and exert some kind of resistance and then the treadmill which which applies increasing
541.36,545.92, resistance you have to make instead of running on its own and having you run to keep up with it
545.92,550.72, yeah you have to move it and it becomes even more and more difficult to move so it's a
550.72,557.04, quote no like you know pushing a car up a hill or something is all fun right so what is
557.04,561.44, you're gonna jump and no check this out so this poo don't walking it and all of a sudden and
561.44,565.44, the thing can't way more than like 10 cents right and all of a sudden it's like like you've got
565.44,570.08, a horse it's like you got to climb down and everything and I mean no you're seriously like
570.08,574.5600000000001, pulling it's all of like you have to tug a war and and use less energy then to keep this
574.5600000000001,579.0400000000001, 10 cent poodle from life taking a piss on the truck but anyway that's pretty funny you can pick
579.0400000000001,582.96, a virtual poo as well or something you don't have to do that but I mean I don't know why not
583.5200000000001,587.0400000000001, yeah that'd be an excellent game play feature it's cool yeah another thing what else is
587.0400000000001,592.4000000000001, a cool perscupa thing I didn't see a single in their game stores they don't have PC games with them
592.4000000000001,597.6800000000001, that I've been able to find it's up I did find a big banner for uh rise of legends at one store
597.76,602.16, interesting it was like the main thing and it was like a multi platform store but I never found
602.16,608.0799999999999, where the games are at and then I did see a PC store all the PCs are very very small boxes
608.0799999999999,611.8399999999999, in part because of the living conditions they're right you just don't have much real estate and
611.8399999999999,617.04, you don't want to have these mega water cool towers that we got so I don't know I wonder I mean
617.04,622.4, everyone always asks what's the deal why you know why is this PC gaming just so non-existent
622.4,626.8, so to speak over there and uh and you can even tell from the people that were you know talking
626.8,632.16, to a guy from Konami and uh and he's actually does PR forum so he's not making them and he was
632.16,636.8, just convinced he's like yeah well you know we don't make PC games because you know you if you
636.8,641.76," sell 100,000 copies of it that's considered a massive blockbuster and I was like what are you talking"
641.76,646.0, about man I was like you know I don't even need to talk about work you know workcraft with you
646.0,649.52, let just talk about like battlefield two weeks and a million which are numbers which are
650.3199999999999,654.64, more or less the same and that's the measure of success on console and like what's at PC but
654.72,658.96, it's just I don't know if it's perception or what they just think that you know I think there's
658.96,663.68, focus on the Japanese market I mean also it's just be interesting to see I mean to do it like
663.68,669.1999999999999, some kind of research on because because in the east in general PC gaming is pretty big but it's
669.1999999999999,674.72, for whatever reason it hasn't penetrated Japan I mean it's we just did it stories ourselves on
674.72,679.36, China right it's huge obviously in Korea and I think it's huge and it's quite huge because of the
679.36,683.76, gaming centers in some of those countries I mean you know like you know game cafe or something
684.72,689.68, okay me watch shawty are you dying I get I also I warned you I got the flu yeah Japan and
689.68,693.28, I shouldn't be contagious now but I'm getting a little bit of the best grade but just in case
693.28,698.3199999999999, can you lick the mic could you just lick the mic anyway I don't know yeah I don't know how much
698.3199999999999,703.4399999999999, it has to do with maybe some of our listeners that the note for until we research it can write
703.4399999999999,710.0, us yeah and explain to us but I mean obviously the conditions in which gaming arose is a differ
710.08,716.08, vastly between say South Korean Japan or right in Japan it was basically through you know arcade
716.08,719.2, it was introduced through the arcade games and the big companies are still around the damn
719.2,726.88, cone title and whatnot whereas it actually came into being in the PC format in Korea you know but
727.84,731.12, I don't know I mean there's certain dating simulators and stuff are really popular in PC
731.12,735.68, in Japan but really that's it it's just not you know it's not looked upon as being the new
735.76,741.76, are those in the arcade too dating simulators they might as well be there's such random stuff
741.76,746.7199999999999, in the arcade I mean it's all the stereotypes you know where you go and you just make a game out of anything
746.7199999999999,752.0799999999999, there's some simulations yeah there's a game it has all the dials of like the jars of the
752.0799999999999,757.12, Japan rail train that you write around every day there and you basically just look and of course
757.12,763.52, it's on the track you know it's not you know it's a real shooter it's a real game with rails
764.48,768.88, you know there's just guys who would play that over here that's their hardcore train dudes yeah
768.88,774.8, yeah if only have like the engineering that peripheral so there's pretty much anything I can't get
774.8,783.52, pass us whole renting dogs that part is red yeah I think dogs the poor dogs so need like a home
783.52,789.1999999999999, and like is this my name now I know it's maybe it's just the point when instead of just sitting in
789.36,793.6, in the little cage though in the pet store waiting for someone to come and adopt them they spend that time
793.6,801.84, in their life getting acclimated to walks and different paths all the dogs yeah I felt kind of bad
801.84,806.32, about looking at I think Melissa grew up looking at it and she was like like a tell she's she's
806.32,811.0400000000001, not even a dog person she's like a tells you thinking about I was like we're not writing a dog
812.08,814.48, I don't care for and don't you are not writing a dog
814.48,821.9200000000001, uh yeah I would try to think if any other gaming stuff comes in mind but no I mean just
821.9200000000001,826.24, rise a legend and ever quest to advertisements or vice-elections or vice-elections are a
826.24,831.84, class too interesting yeah it's like well I don't want to say for rise a legends but forever ever
831.84,835.6, quest too is if that's the big push there it's like well no wonder PC gaming doesn't mean
836.5600000000001,842.96, wow wow wow but you know if that just podcast not brought brought to you by Sony online
842.96,847.44, yeah it doesn't matter what the game was if that was it if you if there was one game
847.44,854.8000000000001, yeah down pushing everything right well so we so we we so we know what you were yeah we know
854.8000000000001,858.88, even playing and and I and I can my other stuff I've been playing well pretty much
859.52,862.96, let you talk about what your playing is this company here is like everyone
862.96,869.76, company here is a great possibly my game of the year so far on PC great great
869.76,875.2800000000001, game here is yeah that's the good one really really digging it but I'm going to share your undocumented
875.2800000000001,880.24, trick with the with with the listening audience the part I could do that it's not that big a deal
880.24,885.84, but sure um it was especially if you're old like me I discovered that because I don't
885.84,889.6800000000001, I don't think it's in the documentation but if you're playing company of heroes and you're uh
889.68,894.4, I think it's in any mode single player multiplayer skirmish you can actually hit the pause key
894.4,899.68, in your keyboard and still issue commands with your units which is awesome if you're a more
899.68,906.2399999999999, turn-based guy like me so um you know I could actually select the units tell more to go or even
906.2399999999999,912.64, do build orders um and have that all paused and then you just unpause it is kind of like the
912.64,917.04, way like Baldur's Gate and all those RPD's played you know where you could just pause you know
917.12,922.56, going to turn-based mode at any point but I've just never seen that on an RTS I could be wrong
922.56,926.56, that there I mean I might be others before that I've done that but this is the first one I've seen
927.12,931.8399999999999, anyway I mean that's just like one tiny detail of like everything that relic did in this game that
931.8399999999999,938.0799999999999, to me is is is awesome the way they handled the resources you know the whole dirt farming
938.0799999999999,944.88, aspects seems very fresh to me the the strategic point capture uh the the mix of units um
945.68,950.32, it's a natural evolution of dawn of war it is yeah it's like they took everything that they
950.32,956.08, learned and dawn of war and like refined it to a T you got to start playing multiplayer yeah I just
956.08,960.72, didn't feel ready yet yeah this one that I really dig though is like I can you can command a couple
960.72,965.36, units and like you just some to go down a road or something and just just watching the AI take over
965.36,971.36, yes the the covered the way they yeah the divide and the cover and also I think Sean maybe you
971.44,979.12, mentioned this earlier but the ways it like the the the the the the the way that like the other
979.12,984.4, devastation it like a tank will inflict on infantry yeah it's so much better than it used to be I mean
984.4,988.88, I wasn't he was talking about that but like you know you can't take an infantry and shoot a tank
988.88,995.2, repeatedly and have the tank I think you know but you I mean you can if you've got recoilists rifles or
995.2,1000.32, or if you have got you've got to have them and you've got to you have to upgrade right before it
1000.5600000000001,1003.6800000000001, right and it's kind of cool it's like you can and each of the units in the environment you can go
1003.6800000000001,1008.6400000000001, on if if there's a Panzer Schreckling around or an MG nest you can just pick up and you know I love that too
1008.6400000000001,1012.88, yeah I've spent time with like some of the units all just basically have them foraging but it feels
1013.44,1019.0400000000001, quantum quite realistic you know I mean and uh great game yeah and it makes and it makes it
1019.0400000000001,1023.5200000000001, it makes it makes each squad feel more like you want to like cultivate and keep as opposed to just
1023.5200000000001,1027.8400000000001, like disposable troops you can just order up another reinforcement batch and of course it looks great
1027.9199999999998,1032.0, like and you hit like say a half-track that's full of guys and you hit it with an artillery shell or
1032.0,1036.32, something and everyone goes flying out of it you know flips over oh I love to I love to set
1036.32,1041.84, up traps people have a couple like artillery like things like off-site and then Panzer traps
1041.84,1046.3999999999999, on the path finding that's one of the the path finding is I mean it's phenomenal in the game compared
1046.3999999999999,1051.1999999999998, to a lot of stuff I mean it's got issues like if you've got a whole bunch of you know half-track vehicles
1051.1999999999998,1055.36, sometimes you'll see yeah start to do the Austin Powers maneuver yeah I love this I got to spread this
1055.4399999999998,1059.9199999999998, what I call the Austin Powers maneuver because it applies to like pretty much every genre of
1059.9199999999998,1064.24, game I play but it basically goes back to that thing where he does that that boneheaded maneuver
1064.24,1069.84, where he's in the go-car and he's got his like do he's got a deal with an eight-rate but it's like
1069.84,1075.36, a hundred points turn you can't your half-track do the Austin Powers trying to like go to the other
1075.36,1079.84, place anyway that that's also we start using that term and now battlefield to a lot of stuff too
1080.48,1086.08, even to the point where there's a trailer for the last armored fury expansion I'm going to
1086.08,1090.72, cough here and try to hold off and they're playing the majestic music you know the battlefield
1090.72,1094.24, music and stuff getting everyone pumped up at meanwhile they air drop a Jeep and then the guys
1094.24,1099.52, get in it and turn around but it's doing Austin Powers it's supposed to be like dun dun dun dun
1099.52,1109.76, just like so yeah it's been coming here for me and more wow trying to get up to a 60
1109.84,1118.8799999999999, and I just got thanks to you guys a guitar and guitar hero one so I finished a guitar
1118.8799999999999,1122.6399999999999, hero on easy mode and I'm on medium now well you have to get me into unlock all the other
1122.6399999999999,1127.28, not good relationships on other modes so I can tell you I know already I'm not going to yeah
1127.28,1131.9199999999998, because I know you play in the two it just doesn't matter yeah no I played base for years but it's
1131.9199999999998,1138.32, not you know I mean on medium already I'm like what yeah some of the songs it's really fun though
1138.3999999999999,1142.96, hard and anything however I was I was really deflated with this game though and I can't
1142.96,1148.56, this guy ruined it for me before I even played at once because I had to go you know I took the
1148.56,1154.24, guitar home with me that night from work and I had to go straight to my my daughters back to school
1154.24,1159.4399999999998, night so I was and I you know I have a motorcycle so I couldn't leave it on the bike I didn't
1159.4399999999998,1164.56, want to get stolen so I walked it right in the round on your bike with a guitar hero he's kind of
1164.56,1168.72, rock and roll yeah kind of rock and roll but what was even worse was I was in this you know
1168.72,1174.6399999999999, at this you know academic school walking around with this guitar you know I mean it was in the box
1174.6399999999999,1180.56, but one of the dads so I'm friends with who's you know not a gamer though he like saw this thing
1180.56,1186.8799999999999, and he's like oh is that like a Fisher Price toy yeah like no you press the the any
1186.8799999999999,1191.6799999999998, bar to go yeah and he's like well looks like it looks like a Fisher Price toy and I'm like
1191.68,1194.4, not now it's this place he's in game where you like and I was like trying to explain the
1194.4,1198.48, game and he's like I'll see you're just like pressing colored buttons to match the colors on screen
1198.48,1202.16, and he didn't know it at all this is just like he was he was but that's what he's exactly right
1202.16,1205.8400000000001, I know his reductive thing what he didn't even know is exactly right and then I just felt like a
1205.8400000000001,1212.72, complete moron it's like shit going home to play my Fisher Price toy and it's almost your daughters
1213.68,1218.72, now I didn't see you pressing the boat so now I'm at home you know and I'm playing Ace of
1218.72,1223.6000000000001, Spain's or whatever and feeling kind of cool but then part of but in my mind but in my mind
1223.6000000000001,1230.16, I'm also hearing a Fisher Price toy what did you think playing that crap that you were actually like
1230.16,1234.88, no I'd be a real good job I did not think I was going to be a guitar hero yeah
1236.24,1240.72, I didn't but I mean you can't the moment you put that little thing around a little if you
1240.72,1245.2, wait for the box if you just put that thing around your neck you feel like a complete douche
1246.16,1249.52, like you wearing it makes me feel like I don't know why but you know the shirts where it's like a
1249.52,1256.0, t-shirt with like a tuxedo front but I've seen ones where it's a guitar where it's like a guitar
1256.0,1260.8, around like the neck but it's so to fit there it's really small and then like the kids that would
1260.8,1265.6000000000001, wear them would like reach over to their own shirt and go like right right so I feel like I'm wearing it
1265.6000000000001,1269.76, it's true because like the tag goes like down like to my neck basically yeah it's a little open the
1269.76,1276.8799999999999, strap open it's still you look like buddy Holly back up I'm in the Beatles it's a fun game
1276.8799999999999,1280.96, now I did there's something about it's the reason you're playing it home but I also I noticed it in the
1280.96,1286.64, manual you know they have how to play it with the PS2 controller too so you really could just do it
1286.64,1291.36, that way and then you know again that just shows like okay all you're doing is it's just like pattern
1291.36,1298.24, recognition right it's like Colorado yeah it's basically it's better to have a car oh Simon
1298.24,1303.44, more time it's got four buttons on it too just like your guitar here on thing all right I'm never playing
1303.44,1310.48, it again fine I'll stick with them more sophisticated PC games like yeah like faces a war with the
1310.48,1317.2, the red line were as your guys rush in if they're not saying do it for Uncle Sam they say okay
1317.2,1321.84, no my you lose are these are American troops was that barat for no yeah but that these are American
1321.84,1328.32, troops that okay quick disclaimer the game wasn't developed by English speaking people it was developed
1328.32,1333.4399999999998, by best way and written published by one sea okay we are out of like I want to say check those
1333.4399999999998,1338.72, of ackey okay that would explain this line then as we as we're charging an operation overlord another thing
1339.52,1348.08, one of my my trooper says is like the newly not the newly not snatches on our M1
1348.08,1353.28, Garan says we're the hottest in the American army like that's how they talk I'm a
1353.28,1360.72, woman in the show it's like the in you end of us so like that helped yeah so yeah that the game
1360.72,1366.8, has got some some pretty amazingly bad voice work not only that the dialogue you have it doesn't
1366.8,1371.36, just doesn't make any sense at all and then it all just piles up so like say you have a bunch of
1371.36,1375.84, you guys yelling that kind of stuff we are doing for Uncle Sam and then like your commander will be
1375.9199999999998,1379.84, his face will appear on the bottom with a bunch of text and then so will read that and then meanwhile
1379.84,1384.8799999999999, someone just comes in and starts reading you like the entire history of the war but with no punctuation
1384.8799999999999,1389.04, so imagine that like I would our teagun book or something take all the periods and calm us out
1389.04,1395.52, and just read that in the background as you're playing you know so the ally is tried to make their
1395.52,1399.6799999999998, you know mark and care and tan but but met with this and this and then that's just going on the
1399.6799999999998,1403.28, entire time not in between loading or anything wow you see that that's and that's kind of like
1403.28,1406.56, that's why I love those like lost in translation games like it's almost like watching one of those
1406.56,1414.56, like B movies that you know sometimes it's good I can't say it wasn't laughing speaking of
1414.56,1420.24, care of tan by the way I don't ever need a D-day mission ever again you just didn't want to love
1420.24,1424.8799999999999, it though I didn't accompany heroes I wanted that to be over yeah meanwhile I can't have a
1424.8799999999999,1431.6, time to get to it but I always just a movement in two to it is a movement to it is kind of funny
1431.6,1435.52, I remember like doing that mission I just like I just tried a big bite but across the entire screen
1435.52,1442.08, it's okay and just go to the beach because they kept saying you know yeah I'm like right yeah exactly
1442.08,1447.04, I don't know but I just I don't know just when it when the game opening you know you're on the
1447.04,1452.3999999999999, boat going towards the beach again I was like no again if I see that we're hitting slow it's
1453.76,1459.4399999999998, over and over again Ryan if I ask you what you playing are you're gonna go straight into your
1459.52,1464.8, rant Ryan has a rant ready we have a rant ready to win or you playing something besides what you're
1464.8,1471.44, gonna rant about well what I'm playing this is actually lead into what I'm playing okay there we go
1471.44,1478.0, what I'm playing is a nice footnote to what what I want to talk about here okay he actually okay
1478.0,1483.28, for those at playing at home he actually has a full list of pros and cons on it on a print out
1483.36,1491.04, I do I do I'm very passionate about these games and I support you in that yes a great so
1492.3999999999999,1499.12, earlier this week we we all got a stack of Sierra adventure game collections
1500.08,1504.24, and for people who have never played these games Kings Quest space quest police
1504.24,1511.76, quests and leisure suit Larry back during the late 80s early 90s these were kind of the games that
1511.84,1518.96, defined the adventure game market very very seminal games by some amazing game designers including
1519.52,1525.2, Roberta Williams al low sort of like the first generation of great hey let's not forget those two
1525.2,1533.12, guys from indromeda right guys from indromeda so some some great early PC games yeah right so these
1533.12,1539.36, these games most of them will release back when the boss was the dominant operating system and
1540.32,1546.7199999999998, if you're trying to run these games now on modern operating systems not not the easiest thing in the world
1547.6799999999998,1552.1599999999999, and Sierra has released the these four collections for for these series
1553.52,1557.84, ostensibly with the full series on the discs though that is not the case
1558.4799999999998,1564.08, yeah it's a very appetizing as you know finally runs on windows XP right
1565.04,1571.28, right I've got the King's Quest collection down here too as I prop here and right at the very top it says runs on windows
1571.28,1576.6399999999999, XP in prominent you're setting this up for some yeah yeah yeah yeah so the rants come and it's like
1576.6399999999999,1584.72, I feel like he's like shaking his fist for that right hook so well these collections were all announced
1585.28,1590.96, they were originally slithes on Amazon about a year ago right and lots of anticipation
1591.28,1595.3600000000001, and they kept getting pushback pushback pushback and they're finally I think they're shipping the stores
1596.16,1602.56, right now they're all uh 20 bucks they're all 20 bucks they're all very easy chip very very budget
1602.56,1608.4, very cheap budget products little flimsy boxes discs and papers leaves no manuals
1609.3600000000001,1613.28, PDF for me could I get that's actually part of my rant but yeah but go on
1613.8400000000001,1619.76, and if you read the fine print on the back of the boxes you will find out that all of these games
1619.92,1625.76, the miraculous trick that Sierra has used to get them to run on windows XP is just to use the
1625.76,1632.4, dustbox in the later which everyone who cares about these games that that's what they've been
1632.4,1637.36, doing anyway for like the past four years right so this isn't actually anything new that applies to
1637.36,1642.4, anyone who pay attention to these and I mean but that's and that's a case with any old game that runs
1642.4,1647.92, and dust right I mean I could take any of my any of my games that I have sitting around from the
1647.92,1652.4, docera and run a dustbox yeah basically they just kind of optimize the front end and like made
1652.4,1658.88, it to anybody can do it without like without having to know how to access dustbox exactly right
1660.64,1665.04, but well I mean who are they marketing these games too though well consider for $20 budget titles I think
1665.04,1670.5600000000002, it's trying to just cater to like the Walmart crowd and get more people in on like the trying to
1670.5600000000002,1675.1200000000001, bring these classic back to front if you look at the box design it totally has a Walmart kind of like
1675.28,1680.2399999999998, it kind of adds yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think this is yeah you're right I bet that
1680.2399999999998,1684.9599999999998, budget shuffle where sort of to me when I see these boxes I think they're not making them for us they're
1684.9599999999998,1688.56, kind of making them for other people to kind of like get them in on this stuff so that they can bring
1688.56,1693.1999999999998, back these series which I hope is I mean what's weird is these games are so old school and they're
1693.1999999999998,1699.4399999999998, so they're so from a distant time that like I can't imagine all unsuspecting Walmart person buying
1699.4399999999998,1703.76, one of these and boating it up and thinking this was cool right as good as these games all these
1703.84,1711.04, those things like these are too Larry of course as usual Sean cuts right to the chance
1711.04,1717.36, what's important to you can I still play these are too Larry one hand in her now if one hand is
1717.36,1724.8799999999999, mouse control why me I guess you know if you've never heard of these games and you buy say like
1724.8799999999999,1729.6, the king's plus collection and you and you booted up and you can get past the fact that you know
1729.6,1734.1599999999999, these are games from the 80s you know you're actually getting some really good games here
1734.1599999999999,1738.48, but you can go to like a Walmart and like they sell these like bundled boxes of like you know
1738.48,1743.4399999999998, 20 games for a dollar whatever it is and they look like total crap and people buy them because it's cheap
1743.4399999999998,1748.8, right so I suppose maybe somebody would unsuspectingly buy these and and find out that they're actually
1749.52,1753.4399999999998, you know some masterpieces in here yeah that said there's a lot of things that should
1753.44,1759.52, do better what what disappointed me yesterday when these boxes showed up was was to me if you're
1759.52,1763.44, going to take well they obviously I was going to say take the time and money they obviously didn't
1763.44,1768.16, take any money to put these together but what what I would have liked to see instead would have been
1768.16,1775.2, like a criterion DVD sort of treatment here where they actually you know take take king's quest or
1775.2,1781.76, space quest or leisure seat Larry any of these old series and say like okay this you know these
1781.76,1785.92, games have been unplayable for a while now on this platform we're going to update them for XP and
1785.92,1790.96, we're going to give them like the kind of respect and treatment they deserve so here's like a
1790.96,1797.2, jewel case to keep them in for one thing as opposed to just a freaking paper sleeves here's an
1797.2,1801.76, here's a DVD interview with for Bertie Willie right and they have to do some on the old
1801.76,1806.16, collection right so do some behind the scenes stuff and how about the original freaking print
1806.24,1811.28, manuals in the games in the king's in the case of king's quest you need the manuals to play the
1811.28,1816.4, games you know they're you got to interlead the second word from the fourth pair right and so you know
1816.4,1821.52, so there's a stupid there's a super like paper print out that came in the in the boxes says oh
1821.52,1825.8400000000001, you're probably going to want to print out these manuals you know g thanks how about if you printed them
1825.8400000000001,1831.2, out for us it even I got a waist like 40 sheets of paper even if you're in the fireman's printer
1831.68,1837.52, yeah printer to print out of top-ranking manuals go to the game goes look at the box out for Larry
1837.52,1842.88, at the past room look okay the Larry art is standard clip art in the front but in the background
1842.88,1848.96, looks like like a taco shop mirror or something look at it it's not even it's not even the same
1848.96,1855.04, artist is like a Tucker yeah I just think they take Gustalari you know it's weird because you don't want
1855.04,1859.04, to in on one hand you don't want to complain they like in king's quest case you're getting okay
1859.04,1863.6, you're getting seven games for twenty dollars right and games where they're eight so whether we're
1863.6,1866.96, eight so you're not getting masquerade but you're getting seven for twenty dollars so you
1866.96,1872.72, parts you want to go okay thank you Sierra for making these available but on the other hand you know
1872.72,1879.04, your vending which means your lizard is blizzard is is wow it's contributing to your coffers
1879.04,1883.76, there so you've got some money so how about spending a little of the you know billions of
1883.76,1890.08, dollars of wild money and giving these games some some cool treatment you know what is it I mean
1890.08,1894.32, what about like the people that spearheaded that originally maybe they're in a different position
1894.32,1898.24, in the company now maybe they left I mean maybe it's one of those things where it's like eight
1898.24,1903.68, right now to steam because the people that were sort of like making it happen weren't in the same
1903.68,1911.04, position or something that was a case I mean they put it out at like budget where shovel where
1911.04,1915.92, prices but it didn't need budget where shovel where treatment the to me it's just it's I mean
1915.92,1919.76, I'm sure if we went to them and asked them well what's the logic they would probably come back to us
1919.76,1925.76, with well again your games don't sell they might but then you know then don't bother at all you know
1925.76,1932.0, I mean it is like when these came in you know actually you know around the floor people when we were excited
1932.0,1937.84, that people not just not just us people outside of our staff would we're coming in and going oh you guys have
1938.08,1943.52, they remember the election yeah that's an astral just bank for a lot of people but then but then when people when we
1943.52,1950.3999999999999, open the boxes people are just like oh and every time I've called like an EV no one laughed at that
1951.04,1959.52, an astral just bank breaking out your 83 playboy or something yeah
1960.8799999999999,1966.1599999999999, two close to home yeah I was yeah you're right you're played this and then like every time I've
1966.24,1972.0800000000002, called an EV throughout the year to see if if they were in when it got close to one of the
1972.8000000000002,1976.64, slip shipping dates nine times out of ten the guy on the other end of the phone will be like wow they're
1976.64,1982.4, making these so I mean people still remember these games you know there's in there's music
1982.4,1988.96, CDs that I bought like two or three times because they'll repackage it like I have like I think
1988.96,1994.3200000000002, three versions of Elvis Costo's Miami is true because it's sort of a scam but they'll come out with
1994.32,2000.32, like more bonus tracks or even like a new liner note essay might be enough if it's an artist that I
2000.32,2007.9199999999998, really like that I'll invest again like you see a new liner notes essay yeah if I'm hardcore about
2007.9199999999998,2013.36, the person I might well I do have three versions of so many of these are for ever changes you have
2014.32,2020.08, just one okay nice of nice right here you just came out with with you know a new addition of seven
2020.08,2024.8, samurai they had a lot more there you go that's another one yeah same thing and I have I have the
2024.8,2029.52, old criterion seven samurai but they they made it appealing me to buy the new one the criterion comparison
2029.52,2035.4399999999998, is interesting because like how many games out there do have criterion additions yeah anymore I mean
2035.4399999999998,2040.1599999999999, like look at the original releases of games but they could don't you think they could I think if
2040.1599999999999,2044.1599999999999, they want to sell these things now they could get pretty easily just kind of when you know actually
2044.24,2049.28, they did they there there was one thing and it's really kind of niche is like it was a called
2049.28,2053.84, in television lives was a collection of all these old television games but you could also like
2053.84,2058.0, it had a a thoughtful documentation of the history of the company and like you know the history
2058.0,2061.92, of the console and interviews with the guys and it felt like a whole all in one package is not
2061.92,2066.88, the the camera for content right uh and then I actually came out for the PC okay so I mean it was
2066.88,2071.28, kind of like a cool suit to know it's thing it was like a little slice of history right midway collections
2071.28,2075.52, on Xbox had some of the similar features too right actually they came out for the PC as well yeah
2075.52,2080.5600000000004, oh yeah I mean that's exactly the case where like that was a criteria and treatment for classic
2080.5600000000004,2084.88, games and they could very easily put that together for these even when these games originally came
2084.88,2089.1200000000003, out they used to have tons of like bells and whistles and the box right you know and that's what
2089.1200000000003,2093.92, I would have expected out of this you know something I was something about the singam in the like
2093.92,2099.76, plain white sleeves that particularly wrangled me it was like man he couldn't even come up with
2099.76,2104.0, a freaking jewel case what are those costs half a cent and they're like what are those single
2104.0,2108.1600000000003, quick start guide piece of paper and right well the one thing I will say is that I was so desperate
2108.1600000000003,2112.7200000000003, to place the base quest six which I haven't been able to get working in Xbox ever that yeah that was
2112.7200000000003,2117.92, like that was payment for me like I was I was happy about that yeah I mean again you know I want
2117.92,2121.76, to completely like don't want to have to try these and come because it's like that's yeah you should
2121.76,2127.44, have a huge void in my PC gaming history in terms of these games and I need to be the one to come
2127.44,2134.16, back and say if you know what this was that these were the golden thing we're going to come
2134.16,2139.04, back in you probably won't I mean they're pretty dated right now the one thing I found myself
2139.04,2143.6, wondering is if I go back and play space quest one or two will those jokes stand a test of time
2143.6,2150.4, and I sure hope so yeah I do this in the future Darren uh we just created an alternate reality
2150.4,2155.52, I mean I do know that like I've replayed the old LucasArts game adventure games and to me those
2156.0,2161.68, even the ones with crappy graphics now like maniac mansion and day of the tentacle because that kind of
2161.68,2166.88, humor is pretty timeless you know it's like watching a whatever side felt arrival of Lucia
2166.88,2173.28, Monty Python where the jokes aren't topical where it's just goofball humor so to me the and the
2173.28,2180.72, writing is so strong that that it over you know it overshadows the 1980 graphics I don't know if that's
2180.72,2185.6, going to be the case in all these games maybe you would be a good test subject Sean
2185.6,2194.9599999999996, try it and I should start with Lucia suit Larry okay Ryan you pick the best
2194.9599999999996,2200.64, cloning for the best Lucia suit Larry on the next podcast I'll come back with my report
2200.64,2208.9599999999996, I'll take note I'll do like a review of it look at it I'll compare it to like some random
2208.96,2213.52, any random like porn or you can get like class of combos volume 27 or something like that's
2213.52,2219.6, that's the misconception about it's not porn Sean it's off-course it's not even that not that it's like
2221.6,2226.16, like a cinema it's like a cinema it's a lot of comedy or something I know it's not porn is that
2226.16,2230.96, dude it's not the right word look at look at this pick up this box then try picking up women
2232.56,2236.56, that's that's all playable and they try going home alone but it'll compare it to the little
2236.56,2242.08, superstar video then look at entertainment permitted now playable on today's PCs including
2242.08,2246.4, for the first time ever windows XP right like I had except for all the years you've been playing on
2246.4,2250.56, dos box already yeah which is how you have to play it here in order to like fan made remakes of
2250.56,2254.32, a moth thanks a lot of these at least the things questions yeah how and they're way better than these
2254.88,2259.6, yeah so I we're not even through with what you're playing here are we we're not in there and what
2259.6,2264.4, you and how I let me say let me interrupt this for a second I think we are going to do
2264.4,2270.0, two podcasts this week correct yeah because we have so much to say so we're going to be back on
2270.0,2275.28, Friday again but so maybe by then we'll be through with everybody's playing yeah we really need to
2275.28,2281.44, get where we can get our own audio stuff in here so we can bring in yeah because I mean we can
2281.44,2285.04, just put that up yeah this way it's still having to describe like the sounds and face the
2285.04,2289.44, word and call a words and stuff I can just we'll just play him say take this out people
2289.52,2295.44, you're right we're still living in the stone h here yeah podcast wait before all right so
2295.44,2302.8, one more thing got got yeah so anybody who's thinking about buying these Sierra collections here
2302.8,2308.56, here's what you don't get in the boxes right okay with the Kings Quest collection you're not getting
2308.56,2314.0, Kings Quest 8 you're not getting the original version of Kings Quest 1 and you're getting the
2314.08,2320.64, crappy Windows version of Kings Quest 7 which is still broken awesome um we're leaders suit Larry
2320.64,2324.4, you're getting you're not you're getting the disc version of leaders suit Larry 6 not the good
2324.4,2330.88, CD wrong version and you're not getting leaders suit Larry 7 or any of the uh offshoot games that they
2330.88,2337.6, made like Larry's casino okay and um with police quest you don't get either of the swat games
2338.24,2343.12, with all of the collections you you don't get the originals of the first game from the series you just
2343.12,2348.64, get the enhanced remakes so okay these can't really be considered complete in any regard
2348.64,2353.2, and isn't there one more series space quest um actually that they they they they they
2353.2,2357.2, this is the most complete they did justice to that one that's been I got to pre-all this week
2357.2,2361.7599999999998, that was the only one I really cared about that was my favorite series so there's no quest for glory
2361.7599999999998,2367.52, no Gabriel night no chance for you to make a cat hair mustache sorry man I know what's
2368.48,2373.44, so I'd say mix review at best for the Sierra collection look at the space quest one if you

2449.92,2454.48, blow through this quick so okay we've already talked a lot about 2142 I had to just find
2454.48,2457.52, get a chance to play us to down play at some more can we can we can talk more about that yet
2458.1600000000003,2462.32, okay well I just read the point where we can like say because before we just like it's like a
2462.32,2466.4, final reviewable I mean like this is like yeah we just don't even live yet that's it's gone gold
2466.4,2470.48, yeah it's the give it have it they have some test servers up right now I assumed it was been
2470.48,2476.7200000000003, live for a while no it's like my last you make I always was thinking the future too yeah
2477.76,2481.76, you were the one thing I always liked about like these you know futuristic games I played a lot of
2481.76,2487.6800000000003, planet side back in the day was controlling mex and like vehicle controls the vehicle I mean let me see
2487.6800000000003,2493.2000000000003, you're you're the ace air pilot from like battlefield two and stuff right right Sean yeah yeah
2493.2,2497.3599999999997, what you know what you're like what you're like what you're thoughts man I mean like I
2497.3599999999997,2503.12, found like what's a lot of the go I mean I can still like the professional review yes
2503.12,2508.72, with the close aircraft it's a good thing it's a good thing it's a good thing it's a good thing
2508.72,2512.7999999999997, it's a good thing everything feels like cotton cotton land like you're like a piece of molasses
2512.7999999999997,2519.2799999999997, and a big a pilot kind and I really don't like the like the big thing I'm making a big deal
2519.28,2523.76, that is the mex and I really don't like how they control it feels like crap yeah it feels like a real
2523.76,2528.8, the hover tanks are garbage compared to that they actually have like standard track tanks in there yeah
2528.8,2534.0800000000004, and the track tanks like and this is like a point of attention before bitching about you know all
2534.0800000000004,2538.88, this futuristic stuff and have a half the time they're reinventing wheels like inferior wheels you know
2539.44,2542.96, and it's like the regular tanks thing they were so much better than the stupid hover tanks
2542.96,2547.44, could we have to turn the whole body around to like traverse the turret and everything and then
2547.6,2552.32, yeah the mech is just like the slow like clump clump clump just what you're thinking but it gets stuck in
2552.32,2556.4, stuff you know it's like hard to tell your orientation next to things you use that Austin Powers
2556.4,2560.48, turn yeah the only thing you can do Austin Powers turn it back yeah the only you could tell
2560.48,2564.08, orientation in the mech is that it's a little kind of a faint arrow on the screen kind of point
2564.08,2568.96, it gives you the orientation of the front of your legs right down on the bottom there's the little
2568.96,2573.76, exactly it doesn't really help but it's just I just don't like the way the stuff feels I mean like the
2574.7200000000003,2579.92, like the hovercraft vehicle and air it's not a satisfying as jet it's not satisfying as a helicopter
2579.92,2584.96, it's just like some weird thing in between and they want to like correct themselves and float and stuff you know
2584.96,2588.48, they they got more lock on missiles which are you know never that exciting
2588.48,2593.6800000000003, it's like it seems to be a good action of leading someone and figuring it working out yourself
2593.6800000000003,2596.7200000000003, and tuning in and then getting the getting killed from it it seems to me it's a one of the
2596.7200000000003,2600.88, concession for people who weren't able to fly in the past because I know that like I'm a dumbass I
2600.88,2605.36, would crash the things as soon as I got off the ground so I was so I kind of assumed like the
2605.36,2608.7200000000003, fact that I kept it in the air longer this time right things that they're there with that and I
2608.7200000000003,2613.6800000000003, don't know if that's that alone is like that's not such a big thing I mean it is attractive to me
2613.6800000000003,2618.4, that like not everyone can fly I mean like in battlefield now per at this point everyone that's
2618.4,2622.32, still playing can fly but at least when they come out I mean it's pretty gratifying to be
2623.04,2627.36, to be able to put some invest some time into it faster and then get it but I don't think that's what's
2627.36,2631.52, killing for me because it's like the vehicles in an inventory of quickwars are very similar they're
2631.52,2636.1600000000003, made to be accessible they're very stable and but I had a lot better time with those and I think
2636.1600000000003,2641.44, it's because of that that feel again you feel even though they are anti-grav things you feel as though
2641.44,2646.08, they are working against gravity so it's like the intuitive physics of it it doesn't feel like
2646.08,2651.28, it's just floating around like a no-clip mode or something you know you feel like it's got this is
2651.28,2655.52, how if such a technology did exist this is probably how it would feel to operate it where is I
2655.52,2660.0, don't get any of that in in 2042 it just is kind of like like I said it's like no-clip you just
2660.0,2664.48, imagine you just draw a box around a no-clip thing and then just there you are and you whatever
2664.48,2667.92, vehicle you are that's kind of how it is and the buggy felt like it was like I was driving a bar
2667.92,2673.12, so just kind of slip it around the environment yeah and you put all that together and it's like the
2673.12,2678.0, the shooting the infantry combat sucks for me it doesn't feel satisfying like you're hitting you know
2678.0,2682.56, it's like it's inaccurate as always the vehicles from your hit stuff and I don't know I mean little
2682.72,2687.36, things are what but it just doesn't feel nothing feels like you're really blowing anything up
2687.36,2691.6, I mean it's all such an abstract environment it's just a bunch of purple cubes and stuff you know it's just a
2691.6,2695.68, few steps up from trauma for me you know like good results just run man that's fucking good
2695.68,2699.7599999999998, words just you know I mean it doesn't have any that physicality or anything that I want and that kind of
2699.7599999999998,2705.7599999999998, game and then I mean to to add you know more and more things I think fundamentally that's the big thing
2705.7599999999998,2711.04, is it just nothing feels satisfying it's not like you can go okay well you know maybe the aircraft
2711.12,2716.16, sucks but sniping is just kick ass you know then sniping sucks maybe it's just awesome to
2716.88,2721.2, you know use a tank or something and that's not really fun and I'm not really finding any you know
2721.2,2726.08, one thing that's especially satisfying it's all just kind of there so not only does it you know it looks
2726.08,2732.0, plays like a mod like we were saying and the main mode is what is really not working for me is like
2732.0,2737.04, originally they proposed the whole tight mode thing is a way of sort of structuring gameplay so that
2737.12,2740.72, instead of having you know whatever you have like five capture points on the map and no one is
2740.72,2745.44, really keyed into the strategic value of anyone if in a public server you know say for example in
2745.44,2750.8, Battlefield 2's Shark Eye the TV station is hands down the most essential base to have and
2750.8,2754.88, and a lot of times public players won't go to it they'll just be out other places while they're losing
2754.88,2759.36, their one most important asset so in this game they're like look everyone it's this big flying
2759.36,2764.88, thing in this guy uh-huh nothing else but then so basically what they want to do is make you you know
2764.88,2768.2400000000002, you do all things in a certain order you get the you capture the bases in the field that shoot
2768.2400000000002,2772.2400000000002, missiles and take the shield off of the Titan and then you go on the Titan and blow that up by destroying
2772.2400000000002,2778.0, the consoles inside of it but what happens is you're assuming all this level of coordination in public
2778.0,2783.36, players that just hasn't been happening in the beta at all no one what's the captain's in any game right
2783.36,2787.92, and so once you get in the base no one I mean it's it's really easy to defend them when you're there
2787.92,2792.4, because now all the spam for nays and then they're all ways and stuff you just see four traps and all this
2792.48,2797.84, stuff you just mind all this all this stuff that they're bragging about that makes the game cool you know
2797.84,2802.8, the drones and all this kind of crap just make the damn thing impregnable once you're in there
2802.8,2807.92, but then because of it too is what happened next is that it was like they saw you know if we do
2807.92,2811.6800000000003, it this way these Titans are never gonna get blown up so then they started making it so that the
2811.6800000000003,2816.48, regular missiles that the capture points in the field will continue to fire and hit the Titan
2816.48,2821.36, and destroy the Titan after the shields are down so that you can now destroy a Titan without ever
2821.6,2825.6, setting foot on it and it's kind of like a weird concession because it's like you know well
2825.6,2829.6800000000003, yeah we had those big ambitions for it and they kind of just don't work so it's now just gonna be
2829.6800000000003,2833.92, and but so what happens is it's back to the same old thing it's just if you control the most points you
2833.92,2839.28, win you know right another stuff there but I don't know it's just some cool ideas but nothing nothing
2839.28,2845.36, is just really satisfying so far okay next thing I was just gonna say Sam and Max I had a chance to
2845.36,2849.52, sit down and play a part of episode one cool and the best out you know not yet yeah we're getting
2850.0,2853.12, we're getting review copies soon and the biggest compliment I could pay to the telltale guys
2853.12,2857.12, as I played through like the opening part of the office and I said I want to stop right now and
2857.12,2861.36, just say the rest of the experience for when the game comes out it's true to the characters I mean
2861.36,2865.84, obviously it's the original team pretty much it's making this game and has the humor and the vibe but
2865.84,2870.88, the one thing that just kind of like by the nature the fact that it's epicidic and I kind of push
2870.88,2874.88, in this thing together if you remember if you if you downloaded the old trailers for what the
2874.88,2878.8, the cancel freelance police game you could tell that that game had a lot more like you know
2879.28,2882.5600000000004, more of you know a lot more happening in the environments this is only so much you can put into
2882.5600000000004,2887.04, the right ones but it's still look really cool and maybe laugh a couple times just not opening
2887.04,2892.1600000000003, sequels so the the episodic nature is gonna be really interesting to see how how plays out here
2892.1600000000003,2896.7200000000003, because these episodes are like couple hours yeah yeah they're saying like three four hours but I
2896.7200000000003,2902.48, think like the big hook that they're trying to like angle is you um or snare uh they're trying to
2902.48,2906.0800000000004, like basically get people to go to game tap because you pay them monthly fee and you get all the
2906.16,2912.16, games plus semi-max right it's just it's just that monthly fee though I think it's like 10 bucks
2912.16,2919.04, a month I think yeah which includes a max okay all the other stuff and they're they're actually
2919.04,2924.48, picking up uh the missed uh again the online uh yeah so that's interesting to see how that's gonna work
2924.48,2928.08, yeah because I mean even though like you're saying it's a much better value and you're like hey
2928.08,2931.7599999999998, I think for me it was like on some weird level I was already thinking like what just what if I just
2931.7599999999998,2934.4, want to get this game I don't want all this other stuff but even though it's like
2934.88,2939.04, you know it yeah you're paying the same price just for the game we're giving you all the
2939.04,2942.4, set of stuff you know like yeah it works you know you know what I was thinking of though is like think
2942.4,2946.08, about like you know okay it's owned by Turner so they probably had this kind of TV channel mentality
2946.08,2950.64, which is kind of true and then you think of it like because you have HBO where you you know you'll
2950.64,2956.1600000000003, watch movies and you but you're also getting the sopranos and you know all these other TV shows
2956.1600000000003,2960.56, right I think it's a notion maybe it's a notion of a subscription and knowing like how difficult it
2960.56,2965.2799999999997, can be to cancel these at times yeah you know and they they rely on that difficulty and on
2965.2799999999997,2970.7999999999997, your sort of uh you're leading this you know right I'm not sure I think it was to pay paid we're
2970.7999999999997,2974.7999999999997, gonna knew it automatically until you hand right exactly but if you know if they had enough premium
2974.7999999999997,2979.2, content to it you know stuff that makes it worth me coming back every month I I'd be okay with that kind
2979.2,2983.84, of thing yeah it's just like I hear what Sean saying though it's like an extra string attached
2983.84,2988.24, if you just want salmon max right because I'm thinking of like yeah what if you just wanted to try
2988.24,2991.7599999999998, the first one you know like it's let me just get this into it yeah well they are talking about like
2991.7599999999998,2996.0, like basically they're doing it like seasons so yeah with what they're like they've talked about
2996.0,3000.72, like they're gonna have like a box set when you're done where you just buy the entire set and there
3000.72,3004.7999999999997, you go yeah that's good so some people might just want to wait well just single like I said
3004.7999999999997,3010.3199999999997, to be available on telltale possibly I'm not sure I'll try and know from playing uh the first
3010.3199999999997,3015.3599999999997, bone episode which which I liked quite a bit I played it with my daughter and we're both fans
3015.36,3021.84, of the comic book but you know there was something you know just inherently not not unsatisfying
3021.84,3026.56, but it's just frustrating when a game is that short and even knowing it's just an episode and
3026.56,3032.4, that there's gonna be more it's like by the time you're into the rhythm of playing it now it's over
3032.4,3036.7200000000003, well that's the trick of having the episodic pace I mean when's the right amount of time between
3036.7200000000003,3041.28, episodes yeah targeting a month between them right yeah well that will the idea there's another
3041.28,3046.0, thing would be like if I get game tap and I have this monthly subscription and part of the
3046.0,3050.0, back by mind and thinking oh what if they like don't hit every month and then I have this game
3050.0,3053.76, tap subscription then it's every two months then I'm really paying twenty dollars per episode
3053.76,3057.84, of that's gonna be good point yeah if they say they really say it the lay it a month and you're
3057.84,3061.44, paying your ten dollars a month and there's nothing else there that month that you're interested in
3062.4,3066.0, yeah well it's only for everything from every indication I would have talked to them
3066.0,3069.76, right sounds like they're on track and also to keep their kind of to keep interest going they're
3069.76,3074.4, gonna have these interstitials kind of like little promotional shorts every week before you
3074.4,3079.36, know up until the next episode that's cool that's a good idea yeah yeah yeah like little like
3079.36,3085.2000000000003, machine of the clips whatever seems like a good format for portable portable systems that's
3085.2000000000003,3090.6400000000003, so yeah to play them on the bus or something like a three hour game session on portable all
3090.6400000000003,3094.48, of a sudden seems a lot you know a lot more deal before like I'm not gonna write right like to
3094.48,3101.28, admit that's a really good point hmm mr. Maloy uh you probably know the answer already
3101.28,3106.08, yeah I know what you're playing yeah world of work after your store I feel down nefarian so anyone
3106.08,3110.48, listening awesome that means congratulations everyone else I apologize
3111.28,3116.0, what about John and I saw the the wow trading card game yesterday and Darren too actually
3116.0,3120.32, and that look pretty good I thought are you gonna get back are you gonna go go back in the
3120.48,3125.6000000000004, trading card game I don't know I've dangerous for me yeah I've tried to lose all those aspects
3125.6000000000004,3130.88, of my life now that I'm the age I am so I stopped with comic books and all that stuff trading card
3130.88,3136.6400000000003, games are are you know they can be awesome but the money sink there this is brutal and they have
3136.6400000000003,3141.76, some really nice incentives to keep you buying cards there for wild players what do you want to do
3141.76,3148.2400000000002, you get maloids and stuff or well there's there's three right three rare cards you could get
3148.24,3154.4799999999996, randomly in any package that you can turn them into NPC this goblin I came about this faction
3154.4799999999996,3160.3999999999996, was called a goblin gambling yeah in actual game in the actual game so if you invest in the
3160.3999999999996,3165.04, trading card game the booster packs are going there's going to be three rare cards that you could get
3165.04,3170.8799999999997, that you could then redeem online to get special stuff in the game so I think the most
3170.8799999999997,3175.12, common going to be crying foul about this is it wasn't really know about it they know about it it's
3175.2,3179.92, all cosmetic you know there's nothing that actually boost your stats okay that's what I was going to
3179.92,3185.8399999999997, write but like the first the most common rare card is like some tabard right it's just you know
3185.8399999999997,3191.6, basically a shirt you wear and then right and like the second one was the hippocryph yeah it's a
3191.6,3197.04, baby hippocryph pet which is basically like the baby mirloc that they gave out at Blizzcon people freak
3197.04,3200.96, out about petster people who collect these little all-a-doers there these little tiny things that
3200.96,3205.2, follow you around and people go oh yeah they don't they don't do anything in game they do nothing
3205.2,3210.4, except follow you around I mean I have a baby mirloc and but every time I bring him out I get a
3210.4,3216.7200000000003, comment every time that's your chugness people yeah I want to be your mirloc yeah so especially the
3216.7200000000003,3223.92, rare ones people freak out over yeah and the last one the most rare is a turtle mount with that
3223.92,3227.52, doesn't increase your speed at almost mountain you get increased your speed what is a turtle but
3227.6,3233.2, yeah exactly but right characters under level 40 can also use it so that's the big hook there
3233.2,3238.96, what about what about integrating like the play into the game or like you can play a virtual version
3238.96,3243.36, of it in world of warcraft with other people in there and then maybe that will reflect the physical
3243.36,3248.08, cards you have that's a cool idea that's pretty meta man I don't know well final fantasy has a
3248.08,3252.16, built in kind of car yeah final fantasy 11 right right that's that's off on the side of the
3252.16,3256.3199999999997, is that actually like impact the game itself or is that just kind of like a little I think it's
3256.3199999999997,3262.56, where I was actually really impressed by the trading card game itself it's upper deck who makes
3262.56,3266.96, it and they they came in and they taught us the rules and we played a game and I thought it did a
3266.96,3272.3199999999997, really nice job of you know it's kind of your basic magic the gathering model where you're you
3272.3199999999997,3275.2799999999997, have a certain amount of points you know each side of certain amount of points you get a
3275.2799999999997,3279.68, will it down to zero so that that basic thing is there but they did I thought a really cool
3279.68,3287.68, job of integrating the classes and really the races yet but classes the abilities the weapons all
3287.68,3293.7599999999998, that stuff is straight out of wow yeah definitely had the flavor right mm-hmm it was like you
3293.7599999999998,3299.2799999999997, get one hero character and you can equip them with all the weapons you know and there's
3299.2799999999997,3304.8799999999997, all the quests are from the game right right instead of lands and magic you have quests and the
3304.88,3309.52, quests are straight out of wow right and the ability and like the abilities that you get
3309.52,3314.32, when you use them they behave pretty much like they do in the MMO like leave you know it's
3314.32,3320.0, two allies instead of just like the main character so do they leave us any decks for you
3320.0,3328.48, now I think I was gonna post on my blocks some some we have some jpegs of the cards I think
3328.48,3333.28, all thank anybody's actually interested they could go check up my blog but did this so did the
3333.28,3337.92, turtle mount appeal to you did that make you want to buy booster packs okay I already
3337.92,3342.96, already pure just before I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry you pre-ordered this part yeah he's
3342.96,3348.6400000000003, hard going the wild problem can't you like yeah we feed off each other when this
3348.6400000000003,3352.7200000000003, yeah yeah because we were like we have a ton of magic cards maybe a ton of those stupid hero
3352.7200000000003,3356.7200000000003, clicks so we were like hey no more of these right and then like so you freaking out the main
3356.72,3362.8799999999997, page nice coming out well I don't really can make it whatever but like yeah we're just like
3362.8799999999997,3369.52, would you play the wildcraft you and I'm like yeah yeah something to be said for
3369.52,3377.04, living with a non-gamer yeah yeah I've I see you fool's playing that at lunch
3378.56,3383.3599999999997, yeah it's all around you can break out of us you know what the cool's like they did
3383.44,3388.6400000000003, bring this back to Japan they had um these card arcade games there where it's like a hybrid of a card
3388.6400000000003,3392.96, game in a video game so I was wondering like if they could do more to implement it into the like the
3392.96,3398.48, real world of work up where did it work have you know like so it's like there's like a table like
3398.48,3402.88, one of them say would be soccer right can you have like eight of them all connected everyone's playing
3402.88,3406.7200000000003, or more than that or you think it kind of like an option house everyone kind of sits around
3406.7200000000003,3409.92, on gambling parlor and kind of throw things in the cards right but right they're sitting there and
3409.92,3414.0, it's a video game screen okay and then there's a video game screen on the bottom then you set your
3414.0,3417.52, cards on them so you set your players like say if it was like a you know whatever I don't
3417.52,3422.08, want us like football card you saw in your yard you set your guys up like you wouldn't a team and
3422.08,3426.56, then it reads stats from the card or something huh and you locate you move them around and it's like
3426.56,3430.7200000000003, it's just as interesting yeah that was the big height there that's the stuff that everyone's
3430.7200000000003,3435.28, playing in the arcade there's well actually what I like about the yeah I like the trading card
3435.36,3440.4, the black and yesterday the the raid packed it or the raid game they showed having an Xia
3441.6000000000004,3447.2000000000003, game where card reading and yeah where where one person is essentially like the like a dungeon
3447.2000000000003,3453.6000000000004, master sort of and three players are playing against that one person who is playing as the big dragon
3453.6000000000004,3460.0, well I remember when those people in the league's here yes you do is there in the card game is there
3460.0,3465.92, dice there is a league right Jenkins card yeah you get to play the league really card
3465.92,3472.24, right made by the pinnier kid guys yeah this is the card do they they said it does have an ability
3472.24,3478.24, like yeah why it's your a oils your raid basically yeah no he did they get an ability wow
3478.24,3483.28, the the dice card gives you plus fifty dots what does this should there should be a dot a
3483.28,3488.32, dives cartoon yeah i think in the scheme of things he's probably better than the hero
3488.48,3493.84, just because the hero I think was a stunt right i think this guy is just like a genuine tool
3495.52,3502.0800000000004, and it's with a lot of time yeah where are we at on time are we almost it's a good list at
3502.0800000000004,3507.2000000000003, at a time it's for about seven minutes it's seven minutes no fifty seven minutes is how long we've been
3507.2000000000003,3511.6000000000004, oh fifty so we're getting a quarter kind of close okay we got we got to get kicked out of here in about
3511.6000000000004,3517.84, five minutes I think so we'll wrap it up we'll be back can I slip in one new story yeah oh yeah you
3517.84,3522.1600000000003, may down thank you i'm only slipping in this one because i want to make sure this gets up for xo six
3522.88,3528.32, because the room of patrol so last week we uh last time we recorded we talked about halo jen the rts
3528.32,3532.88, halo tribute which was coming up for cnc generals which was cancelled so i did a little diggin
3532.88,3536.96, and i was kind of curious about well you know what the story was behind it because you know
3536.96,3542.8, think about it bungee was behind the the myth the myth series you know uh it's tactical it was a
3542.88,3548.5600000000004, classic art classic art it was it was tactical yeah so anyway i was asking around what the deal
3548.5600000000004,3555.04, was and i have some pretty good sources were telling me that at xo six uh bungee is going to
3555.04,3561.6000000000004, announce that they have a group working on an rts halo game the hook is that it's coming out for
3561.6000000000004,3568.0800000000004, the 360 from what i keep from what i'm hearing from a couple from some people me 360 only 360 well
3568.16,3572.08, possibly only what i'm hoping is that it's just going to set it that it's just not announced for the
3572.08,3577.6, PC and it's coming because it only makes sense i mean in this i i just remember going to all these
3577.6,3581.6, meetings where they talk about how the futures grade the PC is going to work in conjunction with
3581.6,3585.7599999999998, the 360 and the guy playing the rts on the PC is going to be able to communicate with the guy
3586.4,3592.0, playing uh first person shooter experience or whatever on the consoles i mean what what better
3592.0,3597.84, way to do it than have an uh halo rts game commander telling some dude in halo three to go over
3597.84,3602.48, take the hill or something so what you're saying is that the halo rts would make a great
3602.48,3607.92, games for windows it sure what and i sure hope that they're going to be announcing that at some point
3607.92,3611.92, i mean alternatively i mean it could be something that they are doing i mean like shadow runs
3611.92,3617.1200000000003, kind of bridge in that gap so i can only hope that it's going to be announced fully and if not
3617.1200000000003,3621.52, i'm going to start a damn petition because i want to see that game on the on windows i think that's fair
3621.52,3625.76, and i don't know who better to start a petition for a halo rts than the official games for windows
3625.84,3631.92, magazine and there you have it we'll be also mentioned two after we were uh sort of ripping on bungee
3631.92,3636.7200000000003, for given the season to sister shut down halogen they turned out that they that they actually
3636.7200000000003,3641.92, gave them job offers and it's okay now we're actually i i i heard about that so i was just going
3641.92,3647.44, to add that to but thank you so very cool so they so they shut halogen down right thank given them
