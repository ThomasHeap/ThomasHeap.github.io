0.0,8.0, Hello and welcome back to the CGW podcast. This is the April 3rd April 3rd podcast for a fourth.
8.0,17.0, I already got it wrong. It's April 4th podcast here and speaking on Mike this time was our engineer Scott Asnut who this week has a Mike.
17.0,20.0," Yes, kind of creepy. I don't know if I like it."
21.0,24.0, It's kind of like the teachers now officially in class.
24.0,31.0," Yes, okay. Along with the teacher we have the usual gang of idiots which include Brian Scott."
31.0,36.0, Sean Hill and Darren Gladstone.
36.0,44.0," Yeah, and here we are in the 24th consecutive day of rain here in San Francisco, I think."
44.0,46.0," Yeah, 25. Don't show him that."
46.0,50.0," Okay. Is it this is? No, no, no, this is just a freeaway boy."
50.0,52.0," Oh, we got to end our hang."
52.0,53.0, Happening here in the podcast.
53.0,58.0," Okay, okay. I owe this to Scott because last time I made fun of his name. He's his last name is not in fact Asnut."
58.0,60.0, It is Asnut. Correct.
60.0,61.0, Not enough.
61.0,62.0, Okay. What was it?
62.0,64.0, It's not Asnut.
64.0,65.0, No.
65.0,67.0," Anyway, so as payback, I got to read this."
67.0,68.0, Okay.
68.0,71.0," So I can say so much to insult Darren, but that would be too easy."
71.0,76.0," Say things about his heritage and his ancestors, but well, he must be punished. He must be punished."
76.0,79.0," You see Darren is a puts, a large one."
79.0,84.0," There days when he not such a large puts, but many."
84.0,87.0, Here is the punishment.
87.0,88.0, What's the deal with?
88.0,90.0, He can't write or you can't read.
90.0,91.0," No, no."
91.0,92.0, I'd probably write that.
92.0,93.0, It's probably there.
93.0,95.0, I missed a key.
95.0,96.0, Okay. Okay.
96.0,97.0, Okay.
97.0,99.0, There days when you not it's a large puts.
99.0,100.0, Okay.
100.0,101.0, Here's his punishment.
101.0,102.0, I must insert the random phrases.
102.0,103.0, Okay.
103.0,104.0, Okay.
104.0,105.0, I have to read.
105.0,107.0, The random phrase.
107.0,108.0, Okay.
108.0,112.0," So basically, I guess you have no idea what my special brand of idiocy is going to be."
112.0,113.0, Or if it's Scott.
113.0,114.0, Okay.
114.0,115.0, I don't want to show him.
115.0,116.0, No.
116.0,117.0, I don't understand any.
117.0,119.0, I don't get what's going on.
119.0,120.0, Three minutes in.
120.0,121.0, Wow.
121.0,122.0, We just killed time.
122.0,123.0, Okay.
123.0,124.0, On to the show.
124.0,126.0, We're recording the sober.
126.0,127.0, Yeah.
127.0,128.0, That's the funny part of the all this.
128.0,129.0, Yeah.
129.0,132.0," You know, we're not altered in any way shape or a form."
132.0,133.0, Right.
133.0,137.0," Though if we switch the podcast time to Fridays at four or something, I'm thinking, oh yeah."
137.0,138.0, We don't have to be sober.
138.0,141.0, Otherwise it's going to read like all star Superman.
141.0,144.0, Issue number three without Samson in the time cart.
144.0,147.0, Sean's been wanting to say that for the last 15 minutes.
147.0,148.0, Inside jokes from hell.
148.0,149.0, Wow.
149.0,151.0, This might as well be CGW happy hour.
151.0,152.0, Okay.
152.0,155.0," Clearly, this week's podcast has no theme."
155.0,156.0, No structure.
157.0,159.0, Maybe we should just stop and start over.
159.0,160.0, No.
160.0,161.0, That's entirely up to you.
161.0,162.0, Now let's not do that.
162.0,163.0, What's he going?
163.0,166.0," Hopefully, hopefully people are still listening."
166.0,171.0," I was trying to say when you guys got off on your whole weird, whatever that was."
171.0,172.0, I don't know what he is.
172.0,173.0, It's been raining for a month now.
173.0,174.0, Yeah.
174.0,176.0, So we have no excuse except to be playing games all day.
176.0,179.0," Well, other than Ryan has making the magazine."
179.0,182.0," So before we get into the real issues,"
182.0,183.0, I don't know.
183.0,184.0, Darren Xie has an agenda here.
185.0,186.0, Not a real agenda.
186.0,188.0, Just some quick notes of things going on.
188.0,189.0, Okay.
189.0,190.0, But what do we plan?
190.0,193.0, Is anybody playing anything besides oblivion?
193.0,194.0, No.
194.0,195.0, The same one.
195.0,198.0," Well, actually, after, after what you said last week,"
198.0,200.0, I went back and started playing Godfather.
200.0,201.0, If I give it a fair shot.
201.0,202.0, Yeah.
202.0,204.0," And one thing, I guess we felt emotional last week."
204.0,207.0, It was painfully obvious on the PC version is that it's a port from the PS2.
207.0,208.0, Right.
208.0,211.0," And the 360 versions coming out, what in July?"
211.0,212.0, Yeah.
212.0,215.0, I've made it to see that version and get that port.
215.0,216.0, And get that port.
216.0,217.0, Yeah.
217.0,219.0, That's almost or entirely.
219.0,223.0," I mean, what part of you thinks that it was red to get the PS2 version?"
223.0,225.0," Well, I think the only part of it."
225.0,226.0, The dumb part of me.
226.0,228.0, The f-bake part of me.
228.0,229.0, Yeah.
229.0,231.0, I actually am over a Godfather now.
231.0,233.0, After talking about it last week.
233.0,234.0, You played oblivion.
234.0,235.0, Yeah.
235.0,236.0, A oblivion.
236.0,238.0, You're slumming in between the I waslumming.
238.0,241.0," As soon as I got oblivion, it was all over with Godfather."
241.0,243.0, Didn't you have like a 25-hour marathon this week?
243.0,244.0, I did.
244.0,246.0, The wife was blissfully out of town.
246.0,248.0, And so I was able to play oblivion nonstop.
248.0,251.0, Because that's a kind of wacky guy I am when I'm single.
251.0,253.0, And that game is awesome.
253.0,256.0," What are you trying to do in a lot, mostly again?"
256.0,261.0," Well, what I keep doing, because I can't help but is I keep doing the random quest of people who, you know,"
261.0,263.0, accost me along the way.
263.0,266.0, Like I thought I would just try to blaze through the main quest.
266.0,269.0," But I feel too much like when all these people ask for my help,"
269.0,272.0," I get too do good early about it, you know."
272.0,274.0, And I want to leave him in the lurch.
274.0,278.0," So I've been out hunting vampires for this one group of people, which is fun."
278.0,281.0, But I keep thinking I'm going to get back to the main quest and then I don't.
281.0,286.0," But the cool thing about this game is I guess it waits for you, right?"
286.0,290.0," Like you could, you know, even though time is elapsing in the game."
290.0,294.0, You're not getting penalized by not going back to the main quest.
294.0,297.0," It's just a matter of the monsters will ramp up with you, right?"
297.0,300.0," Right? All the things, all the quests going hold when you don't do them."
300.0,304.0," But on the same note of what you're talking about, is one of the problems I have with the game is that at first,"
304.0,306.0, like you always doing all those side missions.
306.0,310.0," And I was thinking, ultimately what I'm doing is building up my character so that when I go back,"
310.0,313.0," when I do return to the main mission, it's going to be that much easier for me."
313.0,317.0, But of course it turns out it's not when I realize that.
317.0,322.0," I mean, when I experienced that, I actually going back to a main mission and seeing that I was, you know,"
322.0,325.0," underpowered as ever, and that the monsters are head leveled up."
325.0,328.0, That's exactly when I stopped doing all the side missions.
328.0,330.0, I started doing the main mission.
330.0,336.0," That's so different from like every other game, really, where that would exactly be your strategy, right?"
336.0,338.0," I mean, that's what I do in a while, even."
338.0,339.0," Like, well, this is too hard."
339.0,342.0," I'm going to level up for a while, come back and do it when it's easier."
342.0,345.0," But now that, that just doesn't even exist in this game."
345.0,346.0, Right?
346.0,348.0," Yes, it's one of the losses I have in it."
348.0,353.0," It sounds like some people are about to defend it, but whether the loss is for me is that you can't go"
353.0,360.0," throughout the world and go to some really rare, you know, dangerous and exotic area where the creatures are going to be much different."
360.0,364.0," It's kind of like, you decide, I'm going to run through here just to see what the sides look like."
364.0,367.0, But there aren't really those places because the whole world ramps up in the unison.
367.0,370.0," So it's the whole world, basically, at your level then?"
370.0,371.0, Yeah.
371.0,372.0," Wow, that's kind of weird, you're right."
372.0,377.0," So you can't go to like the Uber area just to see how fast you die or just, you know."
377.0,379.0, There are grades in that.
379.0,382.0, It's not marked at precisely the same level.
382.0,385.0," So it's like if you're 14, everything will be 14 or above."
385.0,390.0," So you might run up to stuff that's like, you know, up to 17 or things like that and something that will be lower as well."
390.0,394.0," You know, you'll still run into the odd crowd or something, but not something that's fine like 20 levels."
394.0,399.0," Yeah, you're not going to slip through some area that's right, completely beyond your ability."
399.0,406.0," Also, you know, what we were talking about yesterday, I, when I was playing last night, I still felt the same way about the snowshen of"
406.0,418.0," the game really kind of prevents you from being one, especially if you're a spellcaster or a hunter type of actually dedicating yourself to that class specifically."
418.0,421.0," Like in other words, you have to do melee."
421.0,424.0," This game makes you do melee, whether you like it or not melee fighting."
424.0,429.0," And if you try to just be a spellcaster, you're just going to get your ass handed to you."
429.0,435.0," Right, I mean, I think there are ways around it, but they're definitely impediments because we're saying unlike a multiplayer game where you're the archer."
435.0,439.0, And you're the guy who gets to hang back in a group of people where the tanks are aggrowing up front.
439.0,444.0," Those guys aren't there, so if you want to hit someone with the arrow, you're going to be running backwards and shooting them."
444.0,448.0, And in a game that's dungeon based a lot of times you're in a dungeon.
448.0,451.0, There's something and you're basically running backwards through a maze.
451.0,458.0," There's only so much archery you can do, so it's going to come point when you need to break out the sword or the maze or the hammer and it starts swinging away with that."
458.0,464.0," Right, so I thought I was going to be a pure mage and I ended up just bagging on that character and restarting."
464.0,466.0, With the blade specialization.
466.0,471.0," Yeah, I found myself on either the same problem, or I'm especially like the, like when I was trying to close my first oblivion gate."
471.0,473.0, I have a guy that's just charging me out of nowhere.
473.0,478.0, I think the only thing you do is like just basically do a sneak attack and try to do as much damage on that first hit as possible.
478.0,480.0," And then just, well, yeah, I mean, there are other ways to him."
480.0,483.0, You could start preparing poisons that just drain their fatigue.
483.0,484.0," Yeah, exactly."
484.0,485.0," Yeah, exactly."
485.0,490.0," Comber them and stuff, but those are definitely the more sort of work labor intensive routes to go."
490.0,497.0," So, I mean, theoretically, you prepare something that over and comers into the point where they can barely move and then you sit there and hit them with your arrows."
497.0,503.0, And you're going to have to prepare a number of different types of arrows to do this to multiple enemies when there are more than one.
503.0,504.0, But it's just not the same.
504.0,506.0, I think most people go in and do what you did.
506.0,509.0," They say, hey, this first shot seems clear to me, I'm going to get that."
509.0,512.0," And after that point, then I'm just going to use my dagger on them and hope something."
512.0,514.0, Isn't that what you were doing real life anyway?
514.0,518.0," I mean, yeah, I don't look at me like I'm saying what you were doing."
518.0,523.0," If you're, if I'm in a cave with an amp, right, in real life."
523.0,524.0, Yes.
524.0,526.0, And I shoot him with an arrow.
526.0,528.0, It's a surprise attack and then he's down on the ground.
528.0,531.0, Am I going to keep reloading arrows and shooting him with an arrow?
531.0,534.0," No, I'm going to take out a dagger a knife or a club and hit it."
534.0,539.0," That's true, though, eventually you do as you power up in our tree and this goes from magic too."
539.0,544.0, You get to the mastery and you will actually paralyze him with that first hit sneak attack.
544.0,545.0, Right.
545.0,547.0, So that alone will start to drop him.
547.0,552.0," So I think it's there, but yeah, it's not, it's just part of the realism of the game."
552.0,555.0, You want to be standing over an amp in real life.
555.0,556.0, Wait a little time.
556.0,559.0," Right, with an air shooting arrows at him from a foot away."
559.0,561.0, Let's take a look at him with the bow.
561.0,562.0, The green arrow.
562.0,566.0, He got a heat grower. He put his boxing glove arrow and a wood green arrow do it.
566.0,567.0, What would he do?
567.0,568.0," What would he do, Ryan?"
568.0,571.0, He'd pull out his bow and start whacking on the thing.
571.0,572.0, With the bow.
572.0,574.0, There we have it.
574.0,575.0," Okay, that's the defense."
575.0,577.0," Okay, so I think we can move on."
577.0,579.0, There and you're the man with the agenda.
579.0,581.0," Well, we're still on oblivion."
581.0,584.0," So we'll actually, yeah, this isn't too far off oblivion, man."
584.0,585.0, Micro transactions.
585.0,592.0," Yesterday they announced that you can, I guess, either buy a big Mac or you can buy some shiny armor for your horse."
592.0,594.0, They didn't actually offer the big Mac.
594.0,595.0," No, there's no big Mac."
595.0,596.0, That's what we're saying.
596.0,597.0, Yeah.
597.0,603.0, You could spend your money buying their armor horse armor or you could save that money and go to McDonald's.
603.0,604.0, Exactly.
604.0,605.0, That's a clarifying.
605.0,606.0, Right.
606.0,611.0," Wow, Bethesda has a McDonald's offer."
611.0,613.0, You bond in each box.
613.0,615.0, Redemable for one.
615.0,618.0," Yeah, so what do we think about that?"
618.0,627.0," We were just talking about yesterday and I kind of agree with Sean on this that it just seemed in a single player game, especially if it's an item that doesn't really add anything to the value."
627.0,633.0," I mean, what's stopping me from just downloading a mud or some kind of somebody creates a skin for it that says the same thing."
633.0,634.0, Right.
634.0,635.0, Right.
635.0,645.0," We're in such a different space from the console guys on this count and it really shows, say, for example, one-up coverage of this, their news report said, at a very reasonable $2.50, you can purchase some armor for your horse."
645.0,655.0," And for one, it stopped me and it was like, well, how are we at a point where we have any frame or reference to determine what's reasonable or what's not reasonable in terms of buying a specific item."
655.0,659.0," And then especially for the so maybe for a console guy, that seems fine."
659.0,669.0," And then we're just like, what Darren says, we're used to getting all these, you know, people making armor, making a dragon that we can ride in the game, you know, and then also."
669.0,679.0," So that, I mean, and then also in terms of other games where we're used to getting free maps and stuff and this is happening with Battlefield 2 right now at the year of course, where they're basically charging you money for extra maps."
679.0,686.0," So, you used to unread, you know, unreal $2,000, the last one that was out, I mean, to give you a map hack with 20 maps are free or get into a point where the charging for that."
686.0,692.0," And now with the believing we're into the point where they're starting the charge for, they're going to they're trying to charge for things we're used to getting for free."
692.0,693.0, Right.
693.0,695.0," So I think we're just, we have a lot of built-in resistance."
695.0,697.0, Is it just that horse armor?
697.0,698.0, Is that all there?
698.0,699.0, I don't know.
699.0,700.0," I mean, I don't think it's more than that."
700.0,702.0," Is it that's probably, that's it right now."
702.0,703.0, Yeah.
703.0,707.0," And it's clear it's kind of like, here's the, here's the get you in the door and we'll see, like, how people respond to this."
707.0,709.0," And if it does well, you can count on it."
709.0,710.0," I mean, that's the perfect game."
710.0,715.0," If people buy that in numbers, it's probably takes some 10 minutes to create the asset for it."
715.0,717.0," I mean, it's getting a good question here."
717.0,722.0," Is it, it's not possible for mods to be distributed over that Xbox 360, right?"
722.0,723.0," Is that, yeah, please?"
723.0,724.0, Can you control it by Microsoft?
724.0,725.0, Yes.
725.0,726.0, Okay.
726.0,729.0, So somebody could not create that for Xbox 360.
729.0,730.0, Right.
730.0,736.0," I mean, it makes sense in that venue, but I mean, if they made it a really compelling new thing that really add a lot to the game or"
736.0,742.0," get it like, like, like, like a flying dragon or something like that or something kind of like cool creature that you wouldn't be able to mount or whatever."
742.0,751.0," Well, look, look at it this way. Like say, okay, so it's two dollars for that. Now, what if they said, hey, we've got this booster pack and it's got three types of horse armor."
751.0,752.0, Yeah.
752.0,754.0," And it's got two, two colors of pants."
754.0,756.0, And you get all this for to the horse.
756.0,759.0," And as soon as you start making it more money, it's like, you know, pair of dogs,"
759.0,764.0," as soon as you say, hey, for 15 bucks to get all this, then it, the absurdity of it sort of revealed."
764.0,768.0," Yeah, it's both because you're like, I told you an expansion pack for Marwin."
768.0,772.0," I could get a game that would let me become aware wolf. Now, I'll get some pants."
772.0,774.0," You know, our summer scene is so random too."
774.0,777.0, Of all the things I could have added armor for you horse.
777.0,780.0, What are you going to do with it? You can't fight on the damn thing. You run away.
780.0,781.0, And it takes damage.
781.0,783.0, You know what my horse did yesterday that was weird?
783.0,788.0," I don't, does this happen? You, my horse aggrode abandoned on the road."
788.0,789.0, Have you ever seen that happen?
789.0,790.0, Yeah.
790.0,791.0, Were you on the horse?
791.0,792.0, I was off the horse.
792.0,793.0, Yeah.
793.0,794.0, I don't do that.
794.0,796.0, And the horse aggrode abandoned.
796.0,799.0, And then the bandit ran away because the horse did so much damage to it.
799.0,801.0, And then my horse chased after the bandit.
801.0,802.0, Yeah.
802.0,805.0," So in the game, the bandit's running down the road."
805.0,806.0, My horse was running after it.
806.0,808.0, And I'm running after the horse.
808.0,811.0," I had this same thing where I got off to pick some, to pick some flowers."
811.0,812.0, Yeah.
812.0,813.0, To make some spells.
813.0,814.0, Yeah.
814.0,816.0, But a wolf came by and started chasing the horse.
816.0,817.0, And then so the same thing.
817.0,819.0, You're chasing a wolf that's chasing your horse.
820.0,821.0, Of course.
821.0,822.0, Of course.
822.0,823.0, Of course.
823.0,825.0, To be worth a thousand dollars or more in the game money.
825.0,828.0, I really needed a command to tell my horse to get the hell back.
828.0,829.0, Yeah.
829.0,830.0, Stop chasing the bandit.
830.0,831.0, No.
831.0,833.0, I have a question for you guys with all this stuff.
833.0,837.0," What type of benefit would the, you know, as you're saying with the horse armor and all these little,"
837.0,841.0," you know, body things that you're going to pick up is it going to give gameplay benefit?"
841.0,842.0, No.
842.0,843.0," I mean, not the horse armor."
843.0,844.0," Well, the horse armor."
844.0,845.0, It will in that case.
845.0,847.0, I guess it's because the horse has stats for defense and attack.
847.0,853.0," It's just carry on to not when you're fighting on horseback, which to my knowledge, you can't do, but when your horse is chasing bandits."
853.0,860.0, So the other thing is if you're running cross country and you're doing you're in a hurry and you're not taking the right pass and just jumping everything and making leaps.
860.0,862.0, Your choice is going to start to lose health.
862.0,864.0, So it'll help that way.
864.0,867.0," But I mean, realistically, not really."
867.0,868.0, It doesn't really matter.
868.0,869.0, Your horses are expendable.
869.0,876.0," The thing dies just goes to deal with another one or like I just got a mod that I downloaded that was just to make my horse run much, much faster."
876.0,878.0, Like that's more useful to me.
878.0,879.0, Just to speed up the time.
879.0,882.0, So you can hit those loading times three times this.
882.0,885.0," So yeah, it's a good question."
885.0,889.0," I mean, I guess the possibilities there are good, right?"
889.0,891.0," But again, what are you still getting in all free?"
891.0,899.0," Yeah, I think you shown brought up earlier, but I think that Epic is one of the companies that does a fantastic job of supporting their product after the fact."
899.0,905.0," In their last pack, they not only did they have like 20 maps, but they also added new classes, new vehicles,"
906.0,908.0," new races, stuff like that."
908.0,914.0," So I mean, on the other hand, I guess it's easy enough for us to say, because we do plan the PC and we have got this forever."
914.0,920.0," But four console players, I guess, you know, this is kind of a cool new thing, right?"
920.0,921.0, That they can get content.
921.0,927.0," And we can't really blame, but that is so far because no one's forcing us to get this."
927.0,930.0," In addition, it's not really radically changing."
930.0,933.0," You know, you're saying there's not too much, but on the other hand, if it really did a lot,"
933.0,936.0, we would be upset that we felt compelled to buy it.
936.0,941.0," So just nothing so major that we're really going to miss out, but if you want it, hey, you can get it."
941.0,946.0," I mean, I guess in that sense, yes, if people want to spend their money, then, you know, that's how it should work."
946.0,949.0, I want to mini map.
949.0,951.0, That would be handy.
951.0,953.0," Kind of pisses me off, I have to keep hitting tab."
953.0,956.0, They expect you to have the poster on your wall right now.
956.0,959.0, Who says I don't?
959.0,962.0," Yeah, but in dungeons, that would be pretty handy though."
962.0,964.0, Right.
964.0,966.0, Next on the agenda.
966.0,969.0," Next up, well, I just read this on the news this morning."
969.0,971.0, Ooveball and starcraft.
971.0,972.0, Can I start this?
972.0,973.0," How did you, that's how you said it, did it name?"
973.0,977.0," Yeah, I just really, I just really, I just really, I just really, really, really."
977.0,980.0, It totally removes all my jokes of what would you weld it.
980.0,982.0," Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, you, ball?"
982.0,983.0," Wait, really?"
983.0,986.0," Yeah, I believe I thought, I could believe that's how it, oh, oh."
986.0,988.0," Yeah, I believe that's how it's pronounced."
988.0,989.0, Huh.
989.0,990.0, Wow.
990.0,991.0, That makes them slightly cooler.
991.0,993.0," Yeah, so what's the, what's his red news today?"
993.0,996.0," So apparently, this was, I think, was from AOL games."
996.0,1002.0," They kind of said that, he has got the rise to do a starcraft trilogy."
1002.0,1003.0, So he can toss some.
1003.0,1005.0," Yeah, so I can't wait to see that film."
1005.0,1008.0," Okay, so let's cast it on the fly right now."
1008.0,1012.0," Okay, he was scummy as one of the zerg's."
1012.0,1014.0, Who are Reynolds?
1014.0,1015.0, Reynolds.
1015.0,1017.0," Reynolds, that's who."
1017.0,1018.0," I don't know, he was in that."
1018.0,1020.0, That dungeon siege hasn't since he came.
1020.0,1021.0, And Bert Reynolds.
1021.0,1022.0, And Bert Reynolds.
1022.0,1023.0, And Bert Reynolds.
1023.0,1024.0, And Bert Reynolds.
1024.0,1025.0, Carotop.
1025.0,1026.0, Carotop.
1026.0,1028.0," Carotop could be, what was her name?"
1028.0,1029.0, Caragon.
1029.0,1030.0, Yeah.
1030.0,1033.0, So it's just sounding great so far.
1033.0,1038.0," So far we have, uh, carrot top, steeply semi, and Bert Reynolds as himself."
1038.0,1039.0," You know, you don't know."
1039.0,1040.0, You don't know.
1040.0,1041.0, You don't know.
1041.0,1042.0, You just could make and create though.
1042.0,1043.0," Oh, yeah, the starcraft."
1043.0,1045.0," Oh, like you wouldn't be in line, too."
1045.0,1046.0," Actually, you don't play starcraft."
1046.0,1047.0," Yeah, so."
1047.0,1048.0, I just go to starcraft.
1048.0,1049.0, Could be a good movie.
1049.0,1050.0, Not a good movie.
1050.0,1056.0," I was going to say, well, I hope they, I hope Christians later in terror read"
1056.0,1057.0, all somebody get a parents or.
1057.0,1058.0, Right.
1058.0,1059.0, Right.
1059.0,1060.0, Wow.
1060.0,1061.0," Yeah, that's."
1061.0,1064.0," That enough on the, uh, we've a, I think we're going to cover that."
1064.0,1066.0," I just, I weep silently right now for that."
1066.0,1069.0," You know, don't, can't Blizzard just put the Kabach on that thing."
1069.0,1072.0," Or is this being blizzard in like okay, this did they?"
1072.0,1073.0, I don't know the full story.
1073.0,1074.0, I can't believe it.
1074.0,1075.0, They're going to have to.
1075.0,1077.0, Show them where he has the rights to it.
1077.0,1078.0," They, they, they have to."
1078.0,1079.0, They're going to have to do it.
1079.0,1081.0, But Blizzard is so controlling about their content.
1081.0,1084.0, I can't believe they'd give the right to that guy.
1084.0,1085.0, Right.
1085.0,1087.0, Unless the check was right.
1087.0,1090.0," Now, the, I think it, do they need money?"
1090.0,1091.0, I seriously doubt that.
1091.0,1096.0, 6 million people paying 1495 a month to be.
1096.0,1097.0, No.
1097.0,1099.0, You bowl is determined to get the gold.
1099.0,1103.0," And if it means writing it back to uproot that tree, he's going to do it."
1103.0,1105.0," That's, ooh, Vady, you, Mr."
1106.0,1108.0, Okay.
1108.0,1109.0, There you go.
1109.0,1110.0, That is.
1110.0,1111.0, Silence ring.
1111.0,1112.0, Wow.
1112.0,1113.0, Wow.
1113.0,1115.0," You know, this, this could be the last podcast."
1115.0,1116.0, I'm thinking.
1116.0,1117.0, It's parties over.
1117.0,1121.0, You're going to have that one guy that writes into to say that this was the best yet.
1121.0,1122.0, Yeah.
1122.0,1123.0, Yeah.
1123.0,1125.0, From the chaos at the beginning to this insanity.
1125.0,1126.0, Right.
1126.0,1130.0," Actually, speaking of writing in, that is one thing we wanted to mention here."
1130.0,1132.0, We want to hear from you.
1132.0,1133.0," Yeah, you."
1133.0,1134.0, We want to hear from you.
1135.0,1138.0," And we'll read your questions online here, or online."

1163.0,1169.0," And if your question is, you know, dumb enough, we'll probably read it on air."
1169.0,1172.0," And actually specifically, what does it we want to do, Dern?"
1172.0,1174.0, I think we want to start a new segment called Ask Ryan.
1174.0,1177.0," So, pose any questions, love advice, anything you think of."
1177.0,1181.0," That's what need to be gaming related because, because I'm right in here for you."

1193.0,1194.0, Thank you.
1194.0,1198.0," Just when we're talking about sourcing this specific podcast, it takes a turn for the"
1198.0,1199.0, Fee.
1199.0,1200.0, Yeah.
1200.0,1203.0," CGW, we can mailing it in one step at a time."
1203.0,1209.0," So, if you have a question for Ryan, or an inimitable reviews editor, send us to CGW"
1209.0,1212.0, letters at zf davis.com.
1212.0,1216.0," So, I have a question for you guys to throw something out there."
1216.0,1221.0," What is coming up that you think will be a surprise, or what have you seen in the last three"
1221.0,1226.0," months that the games were like, oh, this is actually cool."
1226.0,1231.0," Well, I guess E3 is usually the place where all that stuff kind of comes about, where you see all the"
1231.0,1234.0, games that we're looking forward to seeing.
1234.0,1239.0," And we are in the middle of working on our E3 scouting report for the June issue, which comes out"
1239.0,1240.0, of me.
1240.0,1243.0," So, it's kind of like, there are some things that we're looking forward to seeing."
1243.0,1245.0, I don't know if we're able to talk about him.
1245.0,1246.0, Can't break NDAs just yet.
1246.0,1249.0," Yeah, I think what Darren's telling us by our issue."
1250.0,1251.0," Well, shuck it up."
1251.0,1255.0," Yeah, some of the stuff, yeah, we can't hasn't been announced yet, and we got the, we had"
1255.0,1257.0, really looked because the long lead time for the magazine.
1257.0,1259.0," So, we won't be able to talk about it yet."
1259.0,1265.0," Other things, and we did see Randy pitchford, President of, you're about your box, it came in"
1265.0,1267.0, with Brothers Norms Hell's Highway.
1267.0,1271.0," This is sort of the third Brothers Norms, and it's running on it on Unreal Engine 3."
1271.0,1272.0, And that's looking really good.
1272.0,1273.0, Looks awesome.
1273.0,1276.0, I think we better say hex highway on this bog.
1276.0,1277.0," Yeah, sorry."
1277.0,1279.0," That's a big hex high, it'd be so technical highway."
1279.0,1280.0, Leap.
1280.0,1282.0," So, you said shit last week."
1282.0,1283.0, I did.
1283.0,1284.0, Yes.
1284.0,1285.0, And you just said it right now.
1285.0,1286.0, And I just said it right now.
1286.0,1287.0," So, whatever."
1287.0,1288.0, You just said John on Hell's Highway.
1288.0,1289.0, Great.
1289.0,1291.0, Longs you don't drop an F-bomb.
1291.0,1292.0," No, it's bombs."
1292.0,1293.0, It's not good.
1293.0,1295.0," So, anything else that we can talk about?"
1295.0,1297.0," But, um, why can we talk about?"
1297.0,1302.0," Well, there's things we saw that people know exist that we think look cool, that we were"
1302.0,1304.0," sort of surprised by, like, Warhammer Online?"
1304.0,1306.0," Yeah, actually, that's an, you know, shameless plug for our"
1306.0,1309.0," May issue, which is always good."
1309.0,1313.0," Yeah, Warhammer Online, which, uh, to be honest with you, that's a game I'm looking forward"
1313.0,1314.0, to playing when it comes out.
1314.0,1316.0," I mean, dare say that it might even be, like,"
1316.0,1318.0," think the game I graduate to after, wow."
1318.0,1322.0," Because it's all about the war, as opposed to, like, you know,"
1322.0,1324.0, farming and crap.
1324.0,1328.0," Wow, it's a big story on Hellgate."
1328.0,1329.0," Yes, I did."
1329.0,1332.0," This is how many, this is two E3s for that game, right?"
1333.0,1337.0," Yeah, yeah, the first game was kind of, uh, first revealed just before you three last"
1337.0,1338.0, year.
1338.0,1340.0," And, uh, they say they're going to be ready."
1340.0,1342.0," Hopefully for the fall, we'll see."
1342.0,1345.0," So, what games are going to make there, like, multiple appearances at E3?"
1345.0,1349.0," Like, what, what are the winners of the stalker stalker?"
1349.0,1350.0, Yeah.
1350.0,1353.0," Definitely coming back for, was it the fourth, fourth or third or fourth time they've been there?"
1353.0,1354.0, Yeah.
1354.0,1356.0," Wait, were they even there last year?"
1356.0,1357.0," Uh, stalker?"
1357.0,1359.0," Probably on, like, one screen or something?"
1359.0,1360.0, Yeah.
1360.0,1362.0," You know, I look good at GDC, which I'm really,"
1362.0,1365.0," I'm really, I'm forward to seeing at E3 is crisis."
1365.0,1366.0, Yeah.
1366.0,1367.0," Yeah, looked awesome."
1367.0,1370.0," People were really, like, like, that was like, so they're talking to floor GDC."
1370.0,1371.0, Mm-hmm.
1371.0,1372.0," That, and, uh, self-actor."
1372.0,1374.0, I don't know how much of a game that is at this point.
1374.0,1375.0, I think I mentioned it last week.
1375.0,1377.0, I hope that comes along pretty well.
1377.0,1379.0," Um, I'll say I'm in max."
1379.0,1381.0, They're going to be showing that at E3.
1381.0,1383.0," Looking for, oh, yeah."
1383.0,1385.0," Hope, I'm just so glad that game is finally coming out."
1385.0,1386.0, Sam and Max.
1386.0,1387.0, Yeah.
1387.0,1388.0, Yeah.
1388.0,1391.0," I'm, uh, like, first try to bring it back when it was at LucasArts."
1391.0,1394.0, And it wasn't Steve Perselle.
1394.0,1395.0, Remember that?
1395.0,1396.0, Yeah.
1396.0,1398.0," Are you talking about the, that, the Xbox One?"
1398.0,1399.0, Yeah.
1399.0,1400.0, Okay.
1400.0,1401.0, That looks crappy.
1401.0,1402.0," Now, it seems like it's in the right hands."
1402.0,1403.0, And I'm excited.
1403.0,1405.0, Can't you tell?
1405.0,1408.0," Well, that has, I mean, it has the pedigree."
1408.0,1411.0," Like, all of those guys are former LucasArts guys that,"
1411.0,1412.0, Yeah.
1412.0,1413.0," You know, part of that whole era."
1413.0,1414.0, Mm-hmm.
1414.0,1415.0, So.
1416.0,1418.0," I mean, if you notice, like, it seems like lately, they kind of,"
1418.0,1420.0, the pendulum is swinging back towards single player RPGs.
1420.0,1423.0," You know, thanks to games like oblivion, but also like adventure games come"
1423.0,1426.0," like kind of coming back to, but more evolved kind of."
1426.0,1428.0," I mean, I mean, that is big as it used to be, of course."
1428.0,1429.0, Yeah.
1429.0,1431.0," I'd say it's a pretty minor pendulum swing, right?"
1431.0,1433.0," I mean, it's one game so far."
1433.0,1436.0," But then you have, like, you know, I don't know, there's other stuff on the way."
1436.0,1438.0," Like, darkest, dark mess I have."
1438.0,1440.0, My Gothic 3 is Gothic 3.
1440.0,1441.0, Gothic 3 right now.
1441.0,1442.0, That looks really good.
1442.0,1443.0, Yeah.
1443.0,1446.0," So, it's actually, it's actually, look really similar, just in terms of, you know,"
1446.0,1448.0, natural environments and whatnot.
1448.0,1451.0," There's, I hate to keep bringing this back to oblivion, but somebody"
1451.0,1455.0," needs to do like a graduate study on how this game, how the heck did this game"
1455.0,1456.0, become so popular?
1456.0,1458.0, The New York Times just did an article on it.
1458.0,1463.0," The San Francisco Chronicle this morning, given a total rave review."
1463.0,1468.0," Like, this game would not, so not have got mainstream attention years ago."
1468.0,1470.0," I mean, none of the Elder Scrolls games did before."
1470.0,1475.0," This is like the geekiest single player RPG, but why is everybody playing this game?"
1475.0,1478.0, And why would it something like the New York Times care?
1478.0,1481.0," Maybe it's because it's a vast world, but it's also easy to interact with."
1481.0,1484.0," And it's not like, I mean, while there is a tutorial and you can kind of"
1484.0,1487.0," reading instruction manual, you really, you don't need it."
1487.0,1488.0, I don't feel like.
1488.0,1492.0," Well, what's the difference between, you know, the past games and oblivion?"
1492.0,1494.0," Well, the past games are all di rolling, weren't they?"
1494.0,1495.0, For the most part?
1495.0,1496.0," This is deja vu, didn't we?"
1496.0,1497.0, Then we can talk about it.
1497.0,1499.0," Yeah, we didn't talk about this before."
1499.0,1504.0," Yeah, because we were at a topics because I have my whole thesis on the, the"
1504.0,1505.0, prominence.
1505.0,1509.0," I mean, how important it is that is a three, one of the 360's first officially next"
1509.0,1510.0, gen looking game.
1510.0,1511.0, Right.
1511.0,1512.0, That's part of that.
1512.0,1513.0, That's part of that.
1513.0,1514.0, That's part of that.
1514.0,1517.0, But that's another thing too is they were really wise in that each day.
1517.0,1519.0," They were just, you know, here's another screen."
1519.0,1522.0, Here's another screen and keep keeping people coming back every day.
1522.0,1526.0," Making sure that on forums every day, there was a new thread started"
1526.0,1527.0, about it.
1527.0,1528.0, You'd go to any message board.
1528.0,1531.0," I mean, obviously, you know, New York Times, you don't go from message boards to New York"
1531.0,1536.0," Times, but in terms of the big picture, in terms of, you know, it's starting fire and spreading."
1536.0,1540.0," I mean, I think they actually did a good job in the way that they, that they marketed"
1540.0,1541.0, and promoted that game.
1541.0,1543.0, So I think it's a number of things.
1543.0,1544.0, Yeah.
1544.0,1548.0," So basically, they tease their audience for a very long time and did it right."
1548.0,1549.0," Yeah, really."
1549.0,1550.0, Yeah.
1550.0,1552.0," So a movie, a new movie every day, a new screen every day."
1552.0,1556.0," And the kind of way that it was, you know, really conducive to sort of viral, you know,"
1556.0,1559.0, spreading of the same sort of thing.
1559.0,1560.0, I'm waiting.
1560.0,1561.0, I've seen it have before.
1561.0,1567.0," I mean, this is game related, but Sony actually created an animated gift of that"
1567.0,1570.0, could be pasted in a forums and signatures and stuff.
1570.0,1573.0," And I was surprised, as soon as I saw that, I thought that was genius."
1573.0,1578.0, And what it was was explaining and demonstrating why their much maligned boomerang controller
1578.0,1581.0," is actually, you know, ergonomically sound."
1581.0,1584.0," But that thing was everywhere within the day, as soon as that came out."
1584.0,1588.0," You didn't know if Sony made it or a fan made it, you know, but I mean, I'm waiting to see stuff like that."
1588.0,1593.0," To me, it seems like a fantastic way to spread messages about your product and as much as I."
1593.0,1595.0, It's kind of like the next way of marketing.
1595.0,1597.0," But yeah, it's a pretty effective thing."
1597.0,1600.0," It's basically just the next way of a viral marketing is just kind of like,"
1600.0,1602.0, immediately just infuse it on the web and throw it out.
1602.0,1604.0, There's as many times as possible.
1604.0,1609.0," Yeah, I mean, it's like, yeah, it's like free ad space animated gift like over and over again, everywhere."
1609.0,1612.0, Right.
1612.0,1616.0," So other games, other games we're looking forward to."
1616.0,1617.0, Hmm.
1617.0,1619.0, Is the wild expansion?
1619.0,1620.0, Burning crusade.
1620.0,1621.0, Sure.
1621.0,1623.0, But that won't come out till 2009.
1623.0,1625.0, That's not official.
1625.0,1629.0, Let's just say to me that it takes a long for an expansion to come out for that game.
1629.0,1631.0, That's taking so long for an expansion to come out.
1631.0,1634.0," Well, I mean, first of all, why should they rush?"
1634.0,1637.0, Everybody's still paying them all their money.
1638.0,1643.0," You know, second, I mean, Blizzard just takes this long with everything they ever do."
1643.0,1646.0," You know, this is not, this is not unusual for them."
1646.0,1651.0," You know, I don't think you're, I mean, right now is where I feel they need to start getting serious,"
1651.0,1657.0," because you can still now, it seems like this mass of people starting to get burnt, burnt out on it."
1657.0,1664.0," But not until now, and really not till oblivion did it seem like that was any need for them to step it up a little."
1664.0,1668.0," Yeah, up until another had some pretty significant updates like the Battlegrounds and such."
1668.0,1669.0," I mean, that's all in the hatchet."
1669.0,1670.0, I'm just asking.
1670.0,1671.0, Sure.
1671.0,1673.0," Yeah, you don't even play the game."
1673.0,1676.0," I'm just asking now that it happens everywhere, because I'm thinking similar terms that"
1676.0,1679.0, Valve are that we're coming up on a year from when we do our aftermath cover.
1679.0,1681.0," Yeah, we were talking about it coming out in three months."
1681.0,1682.0, Yeah.
1682.0,1684.0," Well, well, the fault was there."
1684.0,1685.0, A lot about it in three months.
1685.0,1687.0," Yeah, they thought about team fortress too, too."
1687.0,1689.0, I'm just saying.
1689.0,1690.0, It'll happen.
1691.0,1696.0," You've seen all the stuff that the modders have been pulled out of their SDK, right?"
1696.0,1697.0, Yeah.
1697.0,1703.0," I mean, it doesn't necessarily mean it's true, but there's definitely, unless it's a deliberately placed red herring."
1703.0,1706.0, There's a lot of info in there about team fortress too.
1706.0,1709.0, That would indicate that at least some works being done on it.
1709.0,1712.0," And as opposed to the military looking game that was, you know,"
1712.0,1715.0," that E3 so many moons ago,"
1715.0,1718.0," God, that was 98."
1719.0,1720.0, So yeah.
1720.0,1725.0," But now it sounds like, you know, it's set in half like two methods where you have striders that you can control and all these other stuff."
1725.0,1726.0," Oh, because it was half life one."
1726.0,1727.0," Well, so yeah."
1727.0,1728.0, Right.
1728.0,1729.0, That's crazy.
1730.0,1731.0, Times they are a change.
1731.0,1736.0," We hopefully will know more about that soon, not at E3, but they're not chonteen fortress too."
1736.0,1737.0," Oh, no."
1737.0,1738.0, They're not showing anything right now.
1738.0,1740.0," Even in terms of, you know, what are they publishing?"
1740.0,1742.0, At least at least that's the official line from them right now.
1742.0,1744.0," You know, what are you showing?"
1744.0,1745.0, And absolutely nothing.
1746.0,1749.0," But that also, I mean, that's in keeping with the way they do things, you know."
1749.0,1754.0," I think they're, I think they're, they're, they're stuff, the cards close to the vest,"
1754.0,1755.0, especially 33.
1755.0,1759.0," And to be honest with you, I think it makes sense because these days,"
1759.0,1764.0," I mean, correct, you know, correct me from wrong here, but I feel like there's so much noise happening at E3."
1764.0,1766.0," Like, you're stuck, you're, you're, you're messaging often gets lost."
1766.0,1770.0," So it's almost a better idea to wait until after E3 or before E3,"
1770.0,1771.0," almost to like, right."
1771.0,1772.0, I think that's true.
1772.0,1774.0, And then it seems interesting with M2.
1774.0,1779.0, It's like almost after their last big E3 when they had their demo prior to half of life too coming out.
1779.0,1783.0," And then they had, you know, they had the sort of the, the blast back when everyone started saying,"
1783.0,1787.0," hey, you guys kind of lied about the AI that that wasn't actually dynamic that we saw in that demo."
1787.0,1793.0," And this isn't, so I don't know if it's a response to that, like, hey, we're just not going to show any more stuff to have that sort of situation come."
1793.0,1798.0," Or just in general, valve is like kind of created their own place where they, they really don't."
1798.0,1801.0," They're, they're sort of outside of the normal street thing."
1801.0,1805.0," Because they just connect directly to, you know, their user base, or their site, or stuff."
1805.0,1806.0," Yes, so they don't need the press."
1806.0,1808.0," They don't need, they don't need publishers anymore."
1808.0,1809.0, They can just do their own thing.
1809.0,1811.0," Now that they don't need us, we like them better."
1811.0,1813.0, I think that's great for them.
1813.0,1814.0," I mean, yeah, it's on the way."
1814.0,1816.0," It's, it's fantastic for them."
1816.0,1817.0," It's texture, I think."
1817.0,1821.0," I mean, it's so much better than getting, you know, the press release with the, the manufacturer terms"
1821.0,1822.0, about this or that.
1822.0,1824.0," And then, you know, coverage everywhere."
1824.0,1827.0," We went to this event, which really all it turns out to be is just a big, you know,"
1827.0,1830.0," marketing, fiesta, right, but at least it's not free food."
1830.0,1831.0," And then it's kind of, they surprise you."
1831.0,1835.0," So you, you know, you turn on steam in one day, all of a sudden there, you know, of a sudden you've got"
1835.0,1837.0, something that's ready to play that day.
1837.0,1838.0, A virus.
1838.0,1840.0," Yeah, that's not the good."
1840.0,1841.0, Just kidding.
1841.0,1844.0," Yeah, actually, who's ever going to virus off steam?"
1844.0,1845.0," No, I'm just kidding."
1845.0,1849.0," I don't, I, I wouldn't install steam, so I can't get anything from them."
1849.0,1853.0," Oh, quick update from the virus to, uh, star force."
1853.0,1856.0," We just noticed the other day on Ubisoft, uh,"
1856.0,1859.0, it's publishing Capcom's PS2 games for PC.
1859.0,1860.0," So we should probably, is one of them."
1860.0,1864.0, But you look on the box and there's actually a warning now about their copyright protection.
1864.0,1867.0," Let's write, so it's kind of like a certain general's warning now, basically."
1867.0,1868.0, Yes.
1868.0,1869.0, That's killing me.
1869.0,1872.0," They got to the point where they just say that, yeah, this could cause some issues if you've got, you know,"
1872.0,1875.0," CDR, DVD, they got to get rid of star force."
1875.0,1877.0, They just got to get rid of it.
1877.0,1878.0, I don't want to play here.
1878.0,1879.0, I was a might magic five now.
1879.0,1882.0," And you know, and it's star force though."
1882.0,1884.0," I mean, like, you know, secure around is just, you know, is equally bad."
1884.0,1887.0," I mean, they all these six security protocols that are trying to use."
1887.0,1889.0," And when we are now that they're just kind of like, you know,"
1889.0,1892.0, installing embedding themselves in your system and calling after PC.
1892.0,1894.0," As the thought it was good enough to just give you a,"
1894.0,1897.0, a believe in without any copyright protection software once again.
1897.0,1899.0, Not even an access key.
1899.0,1901.0, There's nothing right.
1901.0,1902.0, You just put the disc in.
1902.0,1905.0," Yeah, well, yeah, and it has a CD key look up."
1905.0,1907.0," So you need the copy of the disc to play it, but that's it."
1907.0,1909.0," And everybody's buying the game, you know,"
1909.0,1911.0, they're not seeing rampant power.
1911.0,1912.0," And I mean, I'm sure there is."
1912.0,1913.0, And it's galactic save too.
1913.0,1916.0," I mean, like that's no copy of protection at all either."
1916.0,1919.0, And people are still sucking that up by the truckload.
1919.0,1924.0," I mean, it's difficult because clearly piracy is a huge matter for PC games."
1924.0,1925.0," Well, sure."
1925.0,1929.0," If those games don't get pirated, I'm sure a lot of stuff like, you know,"
1929.0,1930.0, Godfather does.
1930.0,1931.0, Yeah.
1931.0,1932.0, Especially game.
1932.0,1936.0, I think probably people are more inclined to pirate games that they're not a hundred
1936.0,1939.0," percent sure on, you know, driven bigger cheap skates and and rot about it."
1939.0,1943.0," But at the same time, it's like when when that's our only solution."
1943.0,1947.0," But how many people at this table were listening to the new flaming lip CD,"
1947.0,1949.0, which came out today?
1949.0,1952.0, How many of us here were listening to it last week?
1952.0,1953.0, I'm raising my hand right now.
1953.0,1954.0, But I bought it this way.
1954.0,1955.0, But I bought it.
1955.0,1956.0, But I bought it too.
1956.0,1960.0," I bought it after I had already heard it for free, though."
1960.0,1961.0, Right.
1961.0,1962.0, But I think I'm saying.
1962.0,1963.0, But I think there's a difference there.
1963.0,1967.0," You hear it for free and you listen to it's like, hey, this is really cool."
1967.0,1971.0," Remember back in the day listening to radio when radio stations like, okay,"
1971.0,1972.0, get your tape recorder is ready.
1972.0,1974.0, We're going to play the entire album for you.
1974.0,1975.0," Yeah, you're right."
1975.0,1981.0," You know, and but most of the time we're still going out and we're still picking up whatever album it is."
1981.0,1986.0," Right. Well, you know, I tuned to the case of the flaming lips and made it worth it to me by adding four"
1986.0,1987.0, bonus tracks.
1987.0,1992.0," So even though the the free one was floating around last week,"
1992.0,1994.0, it's I was still incentivized to buy it.
1994.0,1999.0," And I think that's the fact is even without the bonus tracks, I might have bought it anyway just because"
1999.0,2007.0," because well, the problem that I have that I have with getting stuff from my tunes is the fact that I don't have the physical case in front of me where I can look at the liner notes,"
2007.0,2011.0," which is something in the lyrics and stuff like that, which is something that I like to do."
2011.0,2014.0, I'm kind of getting over that after I'm kind of looking at.
2014.0,2015.0, I'm kind of looking at.
2015.0,2017.0, I'm buried in discs.
2017.0,2019.0," I got to like, I got to bait on that stuff."
2019.0,2020.0, Yeah.
2020.0,2022.0, I like a CD tower to me in my house.
2022.0,2026.0, It's kind of like if you go to someone's place and they got crates of old ass BGs album stuff.
2026.0,2028.0, Or a tracks of fun.
2028.0,2030.0," Yeah, yeah, I don't even want that stuff anymore."
2030.0,2032.0," Wow, we went away off topic now."
2032.0,2033.0," Yeah, we did."
2033.0,2036.0," Yeah, I'm still connected to because the flaming lips are on the soundtrack for"
2036.0,2037.0, Stubs and so on.
2037.0,2038.0, So it's still the end of the game.
2038.0,2039.0, So we're right back.
2039.0,2040.0, Still a bit.
2040.0,2043.0, I'll tell you one one old man thing that just goes I thought it was funny.
2043.0,2047.0, My daughter who's 12 actually found.
2047.0,2053.0, I have like 400 LPs from back in the old date and she found one of my albums and
2053.0,2055.0, she had no idea what it was.
2055.0,2057.0, She like took it out.
2057.0,2061.0," Oh, she took it out of the thing and she goes, what is this black plastic thing?"
2061.0,2062.0, It's the frisbee.
2062.0,2063.0, Yeah.
2063.0,2064.0, I think it's all the finals.
2064.0,2065.0, That's music.
2065.0,2066.0, That's pretty insane.
2066.0,2068.0, It makes a funny sound when I crack it.
2068.0,2070.0, Yeah.
2070.0,2072.0, Someday that's going to be CDs.
2072.0,2073.0, Yep.
2073.0,2076.0," It's already halfway there, I think."
2076.0,2077.0, All right.
2077.0,2078.0, We're getting the rap.
2078.0,2081.0, That's what goes back to because we're in the same sort of thing with games too.
2081.0,2084.0," I mean, not to push it too hard, but digital, this could be absolutely awesome."
2084.0,2085.0, Absolutely.
2085.0,2088.0, I'm all for getting games digitally.
2088.0,2090.0," I mean, there's the people that want that hardcore copy."
2090.0,2092.0," But say, for example, with steam, it has a minute of problem for me."
2092.0,2096.0, I've got half life to running on at least three or four different computers.
2096.0,2099.0," You know, as I've upgraded over the years and it's not been a problem."
2099.0,2104.0," I mean, say for example, if they go out of business, something it could become an issue at a point."
2104.0,2107.0," But I think by the time that happens, I probably won't want to play it anymore."
2107.0,2108.0, Yeah.
2108.0,2110.0, And then the box doesn't matter.
2110.0,2114.0," It's like, I mean, some people want that oblivion box to hang up that poster on their wall."
2114.0,2115.0," So you know, it's your mini map."
2115.0,2117.0, They came with a piece of ice throughout the box first thing.
2117.0,2118.0," Yeah, I don't."
2118.0,2120.0," I mean, that's just, just more clutter."
2120.0,2123.0, I think the reason why steam works so well is because it's just tied to your account.
2123.0,2128.0," And whatever, you know, whatever you are, you could download a game of what, as long as you log in with that account."
2128.0,2133.0," And that's, I mean, for us too, when you're upgrading and changing computers all the time, that's huge."
2133.0,2141.0," It's like it's first thing is, all you got to do is get steam and then boom, I've got, you know, six more games on that computer already without a bunch of install codes and this and then."
2141.0,2143.0," Yeah, only they had a more complete collection of all the mods."
2143.0,2146.0, I could just download through steam directly.
2146.0,2148.0," You, you can, it's closer now."
2148.0,2152.0," I mean, you can browse mods through steam and the link will send you right there."
2152.0,2154.0, So it's getting there.
2154.0,2156.0," It's, it's definitely been changing."
2156.0,2157.0, We got to pay attention to it.
2157.0,2161.0," If you look at your mod that's something, they got the friends list working again now."
2161.0,2165.0," And I think through it, I would say just create like a mods tab and you could just kind of like sift through it."
2165.0,2169.0," Like they could have all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the finished door, and you're finished mods that are pretty cool."
2169.0,2171.0," Yeah, that would be awesome."
2171.0,2173.0, The believe me and had something like that would be cool too.
2173.0,2178.0," I mean, we're the, if the developers are just like, here are our hand picked, you know, each week, here are our top five mods."
2178.0,2181.0," You just press this button and, um, here you go."
2181.0,2183.0," Hmm, idea for magazine."
2183.0,2184.0," Hmm, hmm."
2184.0,2188.0," But, uh, well, no, I mean, they're not going to do that when they can charge two for two dollars for the horse armor."
2188.0,2190.0, I'm going to go order mine now.
2190.0,2197.44, now. So I think one further game we could play weekly is a Ryan Scott word count. How
2197.44,2202.72, many words to speak this week? I actually will that'll be starting next week. Go back
2202.72,2208.48," to the next. Yeah, listeners go and go. Okay. Now the squeaky little voice did this"
2208.48,2213.44, much. Hmm. And what do they get? Yeah. Horse armor. Horse armor or something left my
2213.44,2219.2, desk. I'll send it free of a blivey and whoever gets it right this week. Excellent.
2219.2,2222.96, So it's a try. Ryan last week. We talked. You were still playing a lot of guild wars. Are you
2222.96,2228.64, done? Are you past that now? Are you still playing? I'm often on. I'm off right now. You
2228.64,2233.68," were so low in guild wars when I left. Which is the specific. Yeah, which is pretty hardcore."
2234.72,2239.7599999999998, Let's talk about that. What's wrong with soloing? I think you can't. Isn't that normal? Was that
2239.7599999999998,2245.04," normal? I don't know. I mean to take an MMO or I mean if we could debate if it's a true MMO or not,"
2245.04,2249.84, but to take a fundamentally multiplayer game and say I'm going in here on my own. I mean that's a
2249.84,2254.48, pretty big step. I'm gonna drag some NPCs along with me and see how far I get. That's it. Like
2254.48,2257.84, I mean there's always a thing where like the group of people I play with will like if someone
2257.84,2261.84, comes it's like coming out of the closet admit that you soloed one of those games. It's like saying
2261.84,2269.84, you were you were just desperate to. That's essentially soloed. Wow. You know. You do. Okay.
2269.84,2273.92, That's much more likely. You can. Yeah. Well sometimes you want to play playing with other people.
2274.0,2278.32, Sometimes people are jackasses and like you're in the middle of a dungeon and like your five
2278.32,2282.56, hours in and all of a sudden like some dude has to leave go to the bathroom whatever have a life.
2282.88,2287.04, And here I am with no life. I want to finish the damn dungeon but if I don't have my other teammates
2287.04,2291.84, with me I'm screwed. Well I'm like playing with people I know. Right. I don't like that.
2291.84,2296.0, That's all groups of complete strangers. Yeah. I've never partyed up with with bad people. Well that's
2296.0,2300.7200000000003, more what the deal. Yeah. Well the trick is finding those right friends and if you can't find them at
2300.7999999999997,2303.7599999999998, the time. We're still wanting to have any. Yeah. Or again. My case.
2304.3999999999996,2308.3199999999997, Because that's a weird thing. It's like game guilt is almost like this thing that I've got. We're
2308.3199999999997,2312.16, like sometimes I can play battlefield all night. Turned off and I feel fine but like if I play
2312.16,2317.68, a Bolivian for you know whenever like four hours and I turn it off and it's like I sort of disconnect
2317.68,2321.52, from that game world. I started to feel guilty like man what was I doing? Our saint that's what
2321.52,2326.24, I was wondering at the same way with with Guild Wars. I play that too much and so I mean like you
2326.3199999999997,2330.64, could have been writing your novel or was just because you weren't the constructive with your life or
2330.64,2334.8799999999997, yeah because I guess when there's a degree of socialization there I feel like all right that's like
2334.8799999999997,2341.4399999999996, and that's a normal fundamental human activity. So I'm not too far down the rabbit hole you know just
2341.4399999999996,2344.8799999999997, even though we're talking about the worse and stuff like that but then when you're in there
2344.8799999999997,2348.8799999999997, for that long on your own you realize I mean I was completely immersed at the phone right I was an
2348.8799999999997,2353.52, answer and if any of these things happen it didn't matter I was like but how would that be different then
2353.68,2359.92, watch TV by yourself or doing Sudoku puzzles or right or even reading a fantasy novel or something
2359.92,2364.4, they'll get my own neurosis then I was I'm asking to see if you guys ever got that yeah
2364.4,2369.84, but I don't understand why okay I grew through yeah if I spend the whole Saturday playing a game
2369.84,2374.0, I usually feel crappy about myself that's why your daughter doesn't know about records man
2375.12,2381.04, yeah because I don't think you're to the antique shop I'm too busy playing games to talk to my own
2381.2,2385.2, daughter no she's playing with you isn't she yeah she's in the other room playing well
2386.48,2391.84, so she's equally anti social all right let's cut this out. There's an ABC after school special in this
2391.84,2399.2799999999997, anywhere we need a therapist next week. Why do we sock doctor? Okay we're done we're done
2400.56,2407.52, yay we will see you all next week thanks for listening if you made it this far congratulations to you
2407.7599999999998,2412.56, remember questions for Ryan and the Ryan Scott word count if you guess correctly he's
2412.56,2419.04, gonna send you a copy of oblivion are you gonna hold yourself to that yeah just one okay first
2419.04,2423.84, first one to write in all right you heard it here
