0.0,21.0, Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast. This is a podcast for November 13th 2006 not 7
21.0,27.0, 2006 and I hope you like our new intro. I thought you guys should have run with that one.
27.0,30.0, Should I have run along with that? I'm too white.
30.0,31.0," Or you can just been like,"
31.0,34.0, GFW podcast keep my names out your mouth son.
34.0,37.0, I next time I'll try to do some kind of wrap.
37.0,42.0, The kind of wrap by a 45 year old Jewish guy should be in.
42.0,49.0," Hi, we're here and we're podcasting that whole intro threw me off there."
49.0,51.0, We're so much more soulful now that we're going.
51.0,55.0, That we're Microsoft branded for the podcast 1113 podcast.
55.0,63.0, Yo. And I'm here with the whole gang of the GFW editorial staff which includes the following.
63.0,66.0," Ryan Scott. Hi, who this is Darren."
66.0,68.0, Sean.
68.0,69.0, Sean.
69.0,70.0, Sean.
70.0,72.0, Okay. And Darren has permit.
72.0,74.0, You talk about the whole episode.
74.0,75.0, Yeah.
75.0,77.0," Well, so here we are."
77.0,83.0, We just go and just go and check out the next episode.
83.0,85.0, See how that affects the conversation today.
85.0,86.0," Shingta. Oh, the woo."
86.0,91.0, I know that one issue we're having is we sit here ready to talk to y'all.
91.0,93.0, Is that let's be honest here.
93.0,94.0," Also, let's all weekend."
94.0,97.0, We can say it doesn't have to be a very little secret.
97.0,99.0, We played a lot of console games.
99.0,101.0, We did true here.
101.0,102.0, The GFW staff.
102.0,106.0, I don't know what that says other than there's a whole bunch of great console games.
106.0,109.0," All right. Now, not that there aren't good PC games, too."
109.0,112.0," But yeah, it's kind of the console's moment at the moment."
112.0,116.0, Everyone's going to ship shit over the the Wii and PS3 launch.
116.0,117.0, And that's.
117.0,120.0, And two pieces of hardware came out this are coming out this week.
120.0,121.0, Right.
121.0,124.0," In our land, they've already come out and then gears the board."
124.0,125.0, Gears of war.
125.0,126.0, There's a big one.
126.0,127.0, Play over the moment.
127.0,128.0, Play over the moment.
128.0,129.0, Yeah.
129.0,130.0," Actually, I just got a copy today."
130.0,131.0, So I haven't played yet.
131.0,136.0, But it's been really frustrating to go up on Xbox live and see all my friends playing
136.0,137.0, Gears of war.
137.0,139.0, You're playing freaking just do a bit of a human.
139.0,140.0, I'm playing a human.
140.0,141.0, I still do a human.
141.0,142.0, I'm playing a human.
142.0,144.0, I do like 12 year old PC game.
144.0,148.0, I was thinking of giving you like a message on that just giving you a crap.
148.0,149.0," Like, yeah."
149.0,151.0, The room's actually kind of fun after all this time.
151.0,156.0," But, you know, it's doing a little little data at this point."
156.0,157.0, But it's actually a good time.
157.0,159.0, It's actually good that you're playing that.
159.0,161.0," Now, I think right before you go into Gears of war."
161.0,162.0, Yeah.
162.0,167.0, Because one of my sort of pet notions is that Gears of war in a way is kind of like a second coming of doom.
168.0,173.0," And also of a, it's going to sound weird, but Mortal Kombat, you can have to think about it."
173.0,175.0, Or I can just go in and now playing right now.
175.0,178.0," But yeah, we can talk about the multiplayer."
178.0,183.0," Basically, well at the time, both of those games I just mentioned were presented very well."
183.0,186.0," I mean, the graphics were nice on both of those games."
186.0,193.0," But so much of the game is about just the raw factor of like, whoa, I just blew that dude head off"
193.0,196.0," or like, that guy just got sawed in half or there's just guts everywhere."
196.0,201.0," And you'll see that when you're playing online with people, especially if you get into a game with people you don't know."
201.0,206.0," Little younger set, you know, like the, the rolling hard crowd."
206.0,208.0, And the G-thugs.
208.0,212.0," But every time they get to, are you finding little kids playing this game?"
212.0,215.0," No, I mean, like, you know, 18 year olds, 21 year olds and stuff."
215.0,218.0," But it's like, damn, don't I reach you son?"
218.0,219.0, I missed you up.
219.0,221.0," I'm like, but it's just every time."
222.0,232.0," And that's why I play with friends every time they get a kill or it's like you kill them six games a row and then the next they get you and it's like bitch like they get that in real quick before like for the next round starts, you know."
232.0,238.0," So, but I think what I'm getting at is like what I, when you see that kind of reaction or it's just like just yelling in it."
238.0,240.0," I mean, I imagine it's like the uptown comedy club."
240.0,244.0," Kids are doing cartwheels when they get like a chainsaw kill, you know, and they're just screaming and going off."
244.0,255.0," But I think that in the very, in the same way, when Doom came out, it was like that just that raw or this is like taboo stuff or this is just like completely so it's pretty pretty violent."
255.0,256.0, It's pretty violent.
256.0,258.0, It's extraordinarily violent.
258.0,264.0," I mean, I've tried to imagine now if my, what my parents would have done it, they saw me playing that sort of game when I was still living in their house."
264.0,266.0, So I got a point to my wife.
266.0,267.0," Oh, no, it totally."
267.0,268.0, It's otherwise.
268.0,273.0," When you, when you, when you chance or anyone or anything, like, like, it cuts away to a third person kind of you for a second, like even further."
273.0,277.0," It's always just like, no, I'm a, I'm a skewed angle like when you're not seeing when you're playing."
277.0,278.0, Right.
278.0,280.0, And then like it gets a close up and then just blood splatters all over the screen.
280.0,281.0, It's awesome.
281.0,283.0," Yeah, the blood spray goes on the screen."
283.0,289.0," I mean, I mean, there's always been gyps and games with the gyps or even more life like so that like if someone gets by seconded, it's basically like, no,"
289.0,292.0," No, I'm a bit of a zombie cross section point on the box."
292.0,295.0," So you, you've got, you know, you've got anatomical cross section."
295.0,300.0," You've got, it's not like skull fragments come out and you can clearly see what everything is."
300.0,301.0, And it's the way it's presented.
301.0,306.0," It's not only here the chainsaw ripping, but you hear the guy just screaming and crying and, but you can't,"
306.0,309.0," I can't tell you what, I'm going to find the guy's, I love Langarhorn."
309.0,310.0, No.
310.0,314.0," Well, how does it, seriously, how does that make you feel when you're playing it?"
314.0,319.0," I don't know, this, like, said the way it did when I was an arcade in some kid would bust out a new fatality in Mortal Kombat."
319.0,321.0," Back before Mortal Kombat was a joke, you know, right."
321.0,323.0," And you'd be like, oh, how'd you do that?"
323.0,324.0, That was a long time ago.
324.0,325.0, Check this out.
325.0,327.0, And then you like turns into a polar bear and eats the guy's head.
327.0,328.0," You're like, an ability!"
328.0,331.0, That's the ability!
331.0,337.0," But those kids, a new generation of us of me and the stage is like, coming into, you know, into the room with this game."
337.0,339.0, But does it bother you at all?
339.0,343.0," Or does it, I mean, it does when I hear, it doesn't when I play because I'm like,"
343.0,347.0," Yeah, that's cool, but when I hear that eventually, I just find that, that's why actually now,"
347.0,354.0," I just play with people that are already on my friend's list from our forums or from, like, our floor, you know, the game group."
354.0,358.0," Personally, like, I didn't really really notice how gory it was."
358.0,360.0," Like, I think I'm just super disincedized, you know?"
360.0,363.0, What do you see like every horror movie in all that?
363.0,364.0," Right, right."
364.0,366.0," And I think we're about to, like,"
366.0,367.0, Did you play multiplayer much?
367.0,368.0," No, I haven't."
368.0,371.0, It's a lot more obvious in that context because it's happening to you.
371.0,372.0, Right.
372.0,376.0," When you get the close-up view of it, like, with you, like, you being chainsotted and blown up, yeah."
376.0,378.0," Like, I can just grab whatever's needed."
378.0,382.0," Just disintegrate you and like, a headshot is like,"
383.0,386.0," I mean, you know, when you hear horror stories of real war, like, you know, this,"
386.0,388.0," It's pretty much like, along those lines."
388.0,390.0," And that was a little bit what they were trying to do, right?"
390.0,392.0," That's what I remember reading that Cliffie B was, I mean,"
392.0,394.0, That was a little bit of a point of the game.
394.0,398.0," I say it's pretty sensationalized though, because they're feeding on that, like,"
398.0,400.0," suck it down, uh,"
400.0,404.0," History of, of that type of game, you know, competitive game."
404.0,408.0," Like, yeah, if you play this single player when it's really obvious, they're going way over the top."
408.0,409.0, Yeah.
409.0,411.0," Like, trying to be a realistic lore message."
411.0,416.0," I mean, maybe, yeah, maybe in combat, like, one in every, like, ten kills is that nasty."
416.0,417.0, Mm-hmm.
417.0,419.0," But I mean, in here, every six of them."
419.0,423.0," And every kills about a nasty, every death, every face of death is more gruesome than the last."
423.0,427.0," Well, it's a two to bring it into a PC gaming related."
427.0,428.0, Great.
428.0,432.0," Well, just that this is, this is Epic Games first console specific game."
432.0,434.0, So now that you've played it.
434.0,437.0," No, no, it's not really because they had unreal champion."
437.0,438.0," Oh, like, I've got about that."
438.0,439.0," And it's, okay."
439.0,440.0, It's kind of similar to that.
440.0,441.0, Yeah.
441.0,444.0," I'm like, if you see, like, ways in which they learned certain things with unreal championship,"
444.0,446.0," too, that was the one where they brought in all the melee fighting."
446.0,447.0, Yeah.
447.0,449.0," I think part of that, though, is like, like, a lot of the, all their games prior to this."
449.0,452.0," I haven't really been about, like, with the exception of unreal one."
452.0,456.0," Wasn't really about story was originally about, like, you know, set up a tournament kind of competition."
456.0,457.0, Right.
457.0,459.0," So now that it's out, do you feel like this could have been on the PC?"
459.0,461.0," Oh, it's totally could have been."
461.0,462.0," Oh, yeah."
462.0,463.0," I mean, I'm, here's hoping it's still will be in some way."
463.0,468.0," I mean, I, I think there's, you know, a good chance, theoretically, it would be nice if they could do it."
468.0,471.0," If it was on the PC, I know that, uh, one up give it a 10."
471.0,475.0," We're not going to talk about review scores here now, but let's say, uh, it came out on the PC."
475.0,478.0, Do you think it would have gotten the kind of reviews that's getting now?
478.0,481.0," It would have, it would have reviewed very well."
481.0,489.0," I think probably a lot of people in the same way that it did on console, but I mean, I, I have issues with, like, the 10s and stuff that I see for the game."
489.0,490.0, I'm only played half way.
490.0,493.0, But we would have been comparing it to what to fear battlefield.
493.0,496.0," I think, I think a lot of people are getting hypnotized by the awesome graphics."
496.0,500.0," I mean, this is the first game we're really showing off what the unreal 3 engine can do."
500.0,505.0," And like anybody who looks at it even for a second, they're just like, wow, that looks pretty damn sweet."
505.0,506.0, But the can do that.
506.0,510.0," This is actually the first game for like the 360 because that I've gotten that has made me go, woo."
510.0,511.0, Really?
511.0,512.0, Yeah.
512.0,513.0, Wow.
513.0,522.0," You really get a sense for that glow factor too, which is just being that the graphics are sort of like, you know, creating an impression that overall is more favorable than maybe that game itself."
522.0,523.0, That's what I'm saying.
523.0,531.0," One, a few examples I had from the campaign give some spoilers out here, but they're not really spoilers because it's the most basic, you know, rudimentary stuff."
531.0,533.0," But it's like, no turret use."
533.0,534.0," I mean, that's been around forever."
534.0,535.0, Yeah.
535.0,549.0," It's not just shooters, but it's gotten to the point where everyone, you know, critics at least, like, just really rip on a game where they position a turret so that when you grab what as soon as you grab it, you activate, you know, an on on rush of a bunch of enemies that blindly run right into it."
549.0,550.0, So it's got that.
550.0,551.0," Well, it's got a chance."
551.0,553.0, I think I know the part you're talking about.
553.0,555.0, It isn't so much triggered by you touching it.
555.0,556.0," They're actually, it's like a time trigger."
556.0,557.0, Right.
557.0,558.0, So it's still a moment.
558.0,560.0," No, there's a couple of your cards when you're at the turret."
560.0,561.0, There's a whole bunch of stuff that's going to get.
561.0,562.0, Yeah.
562.0,563.0, Yeah. That happens repeatedly.
563.0,565.0, And then there's the one overlooking the balcony.
565.0,568.0," And then there's, you know, there's two of them down there."
568.0,571.0," And you shoot and you're supposed to clear the way for a landing zone, right?"
571.0,574.0, You're supposed to clear the street so that your dropships can land.
574.0,577.0, But what happens is you just sit on the turret and shoot everyone.
577.0,580.0," But what happens is like when I played, we got to a point where there's one guy left."
580.0,583.0," And I knew this because I'm a gamer, you know, because I'm such a hard-a-core gamer."
583.0,585.0, But like it was like nothing's happening.
585.0,588.0," I was like telling my personalist playing with, we're not waiting for a cutscenes."
588.0,590.0, Like there's probably one of the guy still hidden somewhere.
590.0,593.0, And it's not going to load the cutscenes until we've got them.
593.0,594.0, Yeah.
594.0,596.0, So which was the case when we found them in got them.
596.0,601.0," And so those are examples of just really, you know, unremarkable design choices."
601.0,602.0, Mm-hmm.
602.0,605.0," Another quick example would be that there's a section where, you know,"
605.0,609.0," if you go into the darkness, these locust type things fly around"
609.0,611.0, and strip the skin off your bones.
611.0,612.0, So you need to stay on the light.
612.0,613.0, It's like pitch black.
613.0,614.0, Mm-hmm.
614.0,617.0," And the device that they have to keep going to light is that they place these,"
617.0,620.0," uh, propane canisters along the path."
620.0,624.0, But what happens is for one at face it gets ridiculous that they're just so happens to be a pack man
624.0,626.0," trail, propane tanks through the streets."
626.0,628.0, And it's not explained by the story.
628.0,630.0, It's like supposedly your guy has no hallow moments.
630.0,631.0, Right.
631.0,636.0," So what happens in game terms, it becomes so used to after shooting the first one that it"
637.0,639.0, becomes merely a button by another name.
639.0,642.0, And you're like basically it's a light switch in the form of a propane tank.
642.0,643.0, Right.
643.0,647.0, It would have been cool if you could like you could you could find like oil drums or gas canisters or anything.
647.0,648.0, You could like manipulate the environment.
648.0,650.0, Kind of roll Molotov cocktail or something.
650.0,653.0, Naturally flammable like rubbish in the street.
653.0,654.0, That's a position in different ways.
654.0,656.0, So you had choices like this.
656.0,658.0, If you want to create a bonfire like the whole works.
658.0,659.0, Right.
659.0,661.0," Or, you know, the Doom III, uh,"
661.0,663.0, co-op on Xbox had the flashlight system.
663.0,665.0, And even that I think was a more organic and sensible.
665.0,668.0," You think, or flares or anything."
668.0,671.0," As long as the point being that there, those are all good solutions."
671.0,674.0, But I think they're even stronger when they're mixed together.
674.0,675.0, Yeah.
675.0,678.0, Then as opposed to just this one like it's like here's the gameplay element.
678.0,681.0, We came up with we're going to just use this for half an hour.
681.0,682.0, And then there's another one.
682.0,684.0, So there's a lot of stuff like that about the game.
684.0,692.0, In addition to just the retarded dialogue and everything that it's like how many times have you played a game that's basically predator where you're like someone just watch predator.
692.0,693.0, Yeah.
693.0,695.0, Every guy has like arms and a like 60 inches.
695.0,697.0, It's a conference in his legs or like tree trunks.
697.0,698.0, Yeah.
698.0,699.0, And then we.
699.0,702.0, Let's go get us something to kill.
702.0,704.0," No, it's like the problem is what is the body even."
704.0,705.0, But I'm scared for you.
705.0,708.0, I don't know how many variations can you do on that.
708.0,709.0, Right.
709.0,710.0, Right.
710.0,711.0, It just is laughable.
711.0,713.0, It's like you could see when they're trying to like all of a sudden you're walking.
713.0,716.0," You know that part when when out of the blue your guys like,"
716.0,719.0," No, I've got a two-year-old kid and you just like laugh."
719.0,722.0," You're like someone in there was like, we need to try to develop these characters."
722.0,726.0, Someone's like give him a kid and he just like randomly says it when you're blowing up some dude.
726.0,728.0, This reminds me of my kid.
728.0,730.0, I think of a birthday present.
730.0,731.0, But yeah.
731.0,744.0," To bring a full circle, the point I guess I'm making in Darren was like agreeing with me is just that the graphics are so impressive that you it's easy to overlook that and come away with like that raw raw that I was in awesome experience."
744.0,746.0, But I totally stand by the multiplayer.
746.0,748.0, I think it's fantastic.
748.0,751.0, I've been just feeding on that.
751.0,754.0," And well, that'll be great news to all the three six seed listeners."
754.0,755.0, Yeah.
755.0,757.0," I actually, we're sorry we're going to do this."
757.0,759.0, I have to keep apologizing this podcast.
759.0,760.0, We will get to the PC stuff.
760.0,762.0," And actually, I could bring a physical right now."
762.0,763.0, Yes.
763.0,767.0," So if you want to get some if you want to get a small taste of the of the under meal three engine right now,"
767.0,770.0, you can play it on a robable bits on the PC.
770.0,772.0, It's available on steam for 15 bucks.
772.0,773.0, I just finished reviewing it.
773.0,774.0, I thought she had fun little game.
774.0,777.0, So the three six see you under get gears of war and we get robable.
777.0,778.0, It's a little bit.
778.0,779.0, I'm hanging there kid.
779.0,780.0, John five is alive.
780.0,783.0, How did the graphics compare it?
783.0,784.0, I guess it was.
784.0,785.0," Yeah, not quite."
785.0,786.0, What's up.
786.0,787.0, Platform.
787.0,788.0, Exactly.
788.0,790.0, It's a simple little platformer game.
790.0,792.0, It's nothing like it's it's over.
792.0,794.0, It's like over and done within an afternoon.
794.0,796.0, You won't even like it's just it's a really quick game.
796.0,797.0, I think it's over two after noon.
797.0,799.0, There we go.
799.0,800.0, But there's also a level editor too.
800.0,803.0, So you can actually like mess around with the engine.
803.0,805.0, If you really want to get into it.
805.0,806.0, It's kind of cool.
806.0,807.0, That respect.
807.0,811.0, And I guess all we got to do now is just wait until what sometime in queue one for next year.
811.0,815.0, So we can see a place on a two unreal to turn me 2007.
815.0,816.0, Right.
816.0,817.0, But can forward to that.
817.0,820.0, I really am been a while since there's been an unreal tournament since 2004.
820.0,826.0, It's almost like I got because there's like there's only your there's only one first experience with the new engine.
826.0,827.0, It's you know.
827.0,828.0, Yeah.
828.0,829.0, Doing what it does best.
829.0,831.0, It's like by by the time that unreal turned 2007 comes out.
831.0,832.0, It's not going to be.
833.0,835.0," Well, it'll be visually remarkable, but nowhere near it."
835.0,838.0, It won't create the impression that it that it's not.
838.0,842.0," Well, it's the is it won't get the past that that years of war I feel is getting right."
842.0,844.0," I mean, it's like here's where it's still a good game."
844.0,846.0, But I don't think it would be getting solid 10.
846.0,850.0," Well, listen, the gears of war type machine has been going for like over a year now."
850.0,853.0," I mean, there isn't even that kind of hype for unreal tournament at all."
853.0,854.0, It's been really.
854.0,858.0," I mean, it's another, you know, year in a franchise now for that."
858.0,859.0, Whereas gears of war was.
859.0,860.0," Yeah, that's almost the problem."
860.0,863.0," I almost wonder, like, you should they have kept with like the numbering system for that."
863.0,866.0, It's because sure that you just changed the names like Unreal Warfare or something like that.
866.0,868.0," Yeah, it's hard to know."
868.0,869.0, I don't know.
869.0,871.0," Yeah, they couldn't come up with some meetings about that."
871.0,872.0, I'm sure they did.
872.0,874.0," Yeah, but it's still looked awesome."
874.0,875.0, What I saw it.
875.0,876.0, What did I see it last E3?
876.0,878.0," No, I thought last time I saw it was E3."
878.0,879.0," I guess E3, but it looks great."
879.0,880.0," Yeah, too."
880.0,885.0," Ryan, have you been playing any PC games or have you also been consoleing out this weekend?"
885.0,886.0, I play in a damn consoles.
886.0,887.0, There you go.
887.0,888.0, That's all right.
888.0,889.0," That's all, boy."
890.0,891.0, Good answer.
891.0,892.0, Motion for Ryan.
892.0,893.0, Awesome.
893.0,894.0, Awesome.
894.0,895.0, I actually didn't find a.
895.0,897.0, Jaws unleashed on the.
897.0,899.0, I see now you got to mention a good one.
899.0,900.0, Yeah.
900.0,902.0," You know, defending our."
902.0,903.0," Oh, thank god."
903.0,905.0," This is like, Jaws unleashed."
905.0,908.0, A Jaws unleashed is about as far from good as you can get.
908.0,910.0," Yeah, well, you gave it a one, I believe."
910.0,911.0, I did give it a one.
911.0,914.0, That's about pretty much as far from good as you can get.
914.0,915.0, You're right.
915.0,916.0, Right.
916.0,917.0, Did you get the past key?
917.0,918.0, Did you get the past key for the shark?
918.0,919.0, Yeah.
919.0,920.0," Yeah, I did actually."
920.0,921.0, All right.
921.0,922.0, The shark goes looking for key cards.
922.0,924.0, It must have the red key.
924.0,926.0, It's sort of is like this one.
926.0,927.0, It'd be grand theft.
927.0,929.0, Auto sort of open environment.
929.0,931.0, A heart of pain except your shirt.
931.0,932.0, You're a shark.
932.0,933.0, Right.
933.0,935.0, And like straight out of the tutorial.
935.0,938.0, You're in like this this holding like this lab with this.
938.0,939.0, This aquarium thing.
939.0,942.0, And it's all like fine to key card to open the door.
942.0,943.0, The shark.
943.0,944.0, Yeah.
944.0,945.0, I guess to find the key.
945.0,947.0, And so you're like someone around.
947.0,949.0, You don't put up in eating these like doctor dudes.
949.0,950.0, Don't do it.
950.0,951.0, And so it's like echo the shark.
951.0,955.0," And they're running it's funny because like they're you know, they're running around and they're all like who is he dead?"
955.0,956.0, Is he dead?
956.0,957.0, I don't want to die.
957.0,958.0, Where is he?
958.0,959.0, I don't want to die.
959.0,961.0, Like the same three voice clips over and over and over.
961.0,962.0, It's like one of those.
962.0,964.0, And there's the same three character models over and over.
964.0,965.0, Right.
965.0,968.0, And and their their mouths don't move during the cut scenes.
968.0,969.0," You know, isn't this a word?"
969.0,970.0," Two, by the way."
970.0,971.0, It is.
971.0,974.0, And it wasn't like they came up with the license the last second.
974.0,975.0, Right.
975.0,976.0, The license got gone down.
976.0,977.0, It's not like they got gone down to this other game.
977.0,978.0, It was going to be called sharing a shark.
978.0,981.0," Well, it's a soul predator soul for a soul."
981.0,986.0, It was an existing shark game in what's the shark is looking for key cards.
986.0,987.0, Right.
987.0,988.0, It was like this whole size.
988.0,992.0, There's this whole like environmental agenda where you have to stop these like
992.0,993.0, Riller guys from.
993.0,994.0, It was made by a couple.
994.0,995.0, There's a who did love.
995.0,996.0, I can't tell.
996.0,997.0," So oh, really."
997.0,998.0, Yeah.
998.0,1000.0, So it's echo the dolphin was a good game.
1000.0,1001.0, Yes.
1001.0,1002.0, I'll have.
1002.0,1003.0, I'll have.
1003.0,1005.0, If they're in the eyes the rub and there's environmental message there is.
1005.0,1010.0, This thing's been in development since 2003 and it looks it and they decided I
1010.0,1012.0, I guess the last minute.
1012.0,1014.0," Hey, you know, jaws 30th anniversary is coming up."
1014.0,1016.0, Let's just make this a jaws license.
1016.0,1017.0, That'll be cool.
1017.0,1019.0, And they completely miss.
1019.0,1021.0," Yeah, they miss the 30th anniversary."
1021.0,1022.0, The go.
1022.0,1023.0, They do have the same.
1023.0,1029.0," You know, I do remember like seeing the game in a B3 one year and like the big high point like"
1029.0,1033.0," There were like the pure people are showing me was look, you can swim by the beach and pull"
1033.0,1035.0, pluck people off the beach like.
1035.0,1038.0," Okay, it was like a cartoon character like you reach in love."
1038.0,1039.0, Yeah.
1039.0,1040.0, And you you started.
1040.0,1043.0," More on people on the beach and you're like, you'll hit the beach."
1043.0,1044.0, You'll just like run a ground.
1044.0,1047.0, You'll have to like flop back into the water.
1047.0,1048.0, That makes sense.
1048.0,1050.0, That's real.
1050.0,1051.0, That's real.
1051.0,1052.0, So.
1052.0,1053.0, Yeah.
1053.0,1054.0, Nobody.
1054.0,1055.0, It's a real.
1055.0,1056.0," I mean, we'll kill the whales do it sharks."
1056.0,1058.0, But actually kill the whales do beach like that.
1058.0,1062.0, I suddenly reminded myself of the exploding well video on the internet after
1062.0,1066.0," FC and that it's just like the whole thing, you know, you got all these like a"
1066.0,1070.0, Objective stuff like how is my only objective not like kill as many people as possible.
1070.0,1071.0," Well, right."
1071.0,1072.0, That's the your shark.
1072.0,1075.0, It's technically this didn't come out on console right?
1075.0,1076.0," Although I mean, it was a really."
1076.0,1077.0, I did.
1077.0,1078.0, I did.
1078.0,1080.0, I was a lot of came out on.
1080.0,1081.0, Yes.
1081.0,1082.0, I was.
1082.0,1086.0, So I say you're a hyper intelligent shark with an environmental and
1086.0,1088.0, An environmentally conscious super intelligence.
1088.0,1089.0, Right.
1089.0,1091.0," So I was just going to say, I'm going to say."
1091.0,1095.0, I'm going to say that you're a little bit more intelligent in the
1095.0,1099.0, You see that horrible horrible movie with semi objects and all the sharks are on the oven.
1099.0,1101.0, To cook the guy that's awesome.
1101.0,1102.0, Okay.
1102.0,1106.0, So the only piece of game we've talked about now is jaws unleashed with with itself is a port and
1106.0,1107.0, Robo bullets.
1107.0,1108.0," Oh, and Robo bullets."
1108.0,1110.0, So any reasons to get a PC.
1110.0,1113.0, Play games this week window's vista.
1113.0,1116.0," Sean, maybe you've been playing more of the burning crusade Bay."
1116.0,1117.0," Yeah, absolutely."
1117.0,1118.0, You must be liking it.
1118.0,1119.0, Yeah.
1119.0,1120.0, Yeah.
1120.0,1121.0, Yeah.
1121.0,1126.0," I'm discovering a lot of stuff in the beta, kind of making a mental list for like what to do in the actual game."
1126.0,1131.0, Do you actually think announced you had date in the real dates January 16th?
1131.0,1133.0, Are people going on like 40 man raids?
1133.0,1134.0, Yeah.
1134.0,1135.0," No, no, no that's open yet."
1135.0,1137.0, Just a couple of the five man instances.
1137.0,1141.0, So are you going to have a total like route a hot route for when you soon is the game goes live?
1141.0,1142.0, Yeah.
1142.0,1144.0," Well, there's like in one town there's like these two factions."
1144.0,1150.0," Which one decide with and if you've had the side with one everything you do for them, like put you way in the red with the other one."
1150.0,1152.0, So I want to like figure out which ones the better one for.
1152.0,1153.0, That kind of cool.
1153.0,1157.0, I should do that and then post a little you know a super guide or something.
1157.0,1158.0, There you go.
1158.0,1159.0, Are you going to start a new character?
1159.0,1160.0, Are you going to keep playing?
1160.0,1161.0, I don't want to grind again.
1161.0,1170.0," What I've played of the new races is pretty much they look better in their cool, but like it's pretty much the same grind as before."
1170.0,1171.0," Yeah, it's kind of the same grind."
1171.0,1176.0," So I was playing my night off my blood off rogue and I'm like, yeah, I don't think I want to do this again."
1176.0,1179.0," I mean, if you were a new player to wow."
1179.0,1184.0, It would probably be they would be as viable an option as the other race.
1184.0,1190.0," Right, right more so I think I think the racial talents like make us the racial talents are significantly more interesting and again."
1190.0,1191.0, Great.
1191.0,1192.0, Real talents.
1192.0,1194.0," Like they were listening to this or like,"
1194.0,1195.0," Oh, racial talents."
1195.0,1197.0," Well, you can imagine all this."
1198.0,1201.0, You must be talking about this and this and this.
1202.0,1209.0," Well, I was going to say and you know what I played this weekend that was that was not on consoles was ever quest one."
1209.0,1210.0, That's a good.
1210.0,1212.0, That's a weekend well spent.
1212.0,1215.0," Because the hey, come on now."
1215.0,1222.0," It's a little lost forever quest one, you know, in the old days ever quest used to get the respect."
1222.0,1223.0, You've just ever quest.
1223.0,1225.0, He worded used to.
1225.0,1228.0," Yeah, it's to be way back in a time of mages and wizards."
1228.0,1232.0," Yeah, no, I booted it up because there's another new expansion for that game."
1232.0,1234.0," It's well, expansion."
1234.0,1235.0, They're still coming out.
1235.0,1236.0, How many of you were still planning?
1236.0,1237.0, I don't know.
1237.0,1239.0, I tried to get this out of board house.
1239.0,1240.0, Why is out there.
1240.0,1241.0, Yeah.
1241.0,1242.0, It's amazing.
1242.0,1249.0," I mean, I got on there and there's people running around in this world."
1249.0,1251.0, It's like tumbleweed is actually a lot of stuff.
1251.0,1252.0," No, no, they're in that time."
1252.0,1256.0," Did you ask any of them if they're aware that like, they're other, yeah, they're other."
1256.0,1257.0, I've been posted of hello.
1257.0,1260.0, It's 2006 or even if there's ever quest to.
1260.0,1264.0," Yeah, it's really bizarre because the graphics look terrible."
1264.0,1266.0," I mean, this is, you know, what do you expect?"
1266.0,1267.0, An old game.
1267.0,1273.0," I can't do certain point, like maybe, you know, even two months like you stop even noticing that kind of thing in that kind of game."
1273.0,1276.0," Well, I have to admit, I mean, I did play it for many, many hours."
1276.0,1281.0," And after a while, I kind of, you know, those like neurons started firing again."
1281.0,1284.0, The old ever quest stuff started coming back and I started getting into it a bit.
1284.0,1287.0, And I did stop thinking about the way it looked.
1287.0,1288.0, I did.
1288.0,1289.0, Right.
1289.0,1293.0," Well, when you're playing the game like that, that's, then you play it for, you know, how many years of a quest came up before or something else."
1293.0,1295.0, Even viable camera on the corner.
1295.0,1300.0, That's a ton of investment of your life for some of these people that's just impossible to break away from.
1300.0,1301.0, I think.
1301.0,1302.0, Yeah.
1302.0,1305.0," It would have been cooler if they're, you know, what, you know,"
1305.0,1309.0, would it be cooler if they would have been able to take your E.K. one characters and port them into the other games?
1309.0,1312.0, That probably would have been a lot of lives easier for transitions.
1312.0,1313.0, Yeah.
1313.0,1314.0," Accessing, right?"
1314.0,1317.0," Is he something like that happened in, like, a future kind of game?"
1317.0,1318.0, Yeah.
1318.0,1322.0," I know that that's, I mean, that's like the dilemma both, uh,"
1322.0,1325.0, Origin and EA faced with Ultima online.
1325.0,1330.0," And I'm sure that ever quest guys had to ponder that a lot too, right?"
1330.0,1332.0, Would one game turn into the other.
1332.0,1336.0, But now I think ever quest one still has more subscribers than ever quest two.
1337.0,1339.0, That doesn't say anything good though.
1339.0,1343.0," But the thing is, you know, when I was playing ever quest this weekend, I was thinking,"
1343.0,1346.0," well, maybe the low system requirements, because this is such an old game,"
1346.0,1347.0, keep some people around.
1347.0,1350.0, But wow has low system requirements.
1350.0,1351.0, Right.
1351.0,1354.0, So what's the incentive to play ever quest one?
1354.0,1357.0," Actually, if anybody is listening, that is an ever quest one player."
1357.0,1360.0," And if you work for Sony and all listening, you don't count."
1360.0,1364.0," If, if you're a reader and you're listening and you play ever quest one,"
1364.0,1368.0, so I need to post on the boards because we would like to know why you are still playing this game.
1368.0,1372.0," And a nun jerky way, we are not trying to be a driker."
1372.0,1373.0, I don't really want to know.
1373.0,1376.0," I mean, it was interesting to me that there were so many people playing."
1376.0,1379.0," I was like, wow, this is like the city that time forgot."
1379.0,1381.0, There's all these people running around here.
1381.0,1383.0," So I said, you need to slap them upside head and ask them to play."
1383.0,1384.0, Like land of the lost.
1384.0,1385.0, Land of the lost.
1385.0,1386.0, Yeah.
1386.0,1387.0, It's like Chaka around the corner.
1387.0,1388.0, Or what was that?
1388.0,1390.0, And night shine of the line movie.
1390.0,1391.0," Oh, in the village."
1391.0,1392.0," Yeah, you're in the village."
1392.0,1393.0, The village.
1393.0,1394.0, I'm in the village.
1394.0,1397.0, What else do you have to talk about?
1397.0,1399.0, We got more and more social stuff.
1399.0,1400.0," Yeah, more social stuff."
1400.0,1402.0," Oh, yeah, Sean, you're playing the Wii."
1402.0,1403.0," Yeah, yeah."
1403.0,1405.0," Yeah, what do you, what do you guys think?"
1405.0,1406.0, It's fun.
1406.0,1409.0," You know, the, the, the, the, the barometer for any fun system."
1409.0,1413.0," Whatever the, whatever the case is, if my fiancee will play it, if she can, if she likes it."
1413.0,1414.0," Yeah, but."
1414.0,1416.0," But if she, a gamer."
1416.0,1417.0," No, she's not."
1417.0,1418.0, Okay.
1418.0,1421.0," That's what I mean, like it's, if you want, if you're looking to something to break into the,"
1421.0,1423.0," you know, mainstream market, right?"
1423.0,1424.0, How will we like that?
1424.0,1425.0, But that's why we're happy.
1425.0,1426.0," Yeah, she likes it."
1426.0,1428.0, The fact that she likes it makes me no offense to your fiancee.
1428.0,1430.0, If that makes me wonder.
1430.0,1433.0," Also, maybe it's more for her type of rather than."
1433.0,1434.0," Oh, too."
1434.0,1436.0, That's some kind of new load.
1436.0,1438.0, The tech had picked up on the mic.
1438.0,1439.0, I heard it.
1439.0,1440.0, Okay.
1440.0,1441.0, I never want to use those headphones again.
1441.0,1444.0," I'm going to make sure to like, I'm going to just fart it on the podcast."
1444.0,1447.0, We're going to let you put the headphones on the head.
1447.0,1450.0, I can't wait for the Richard us to grab onto the.
1451.0,1454.0," So yeah, we got to watch to see who puts that headset on."
1454.0,1457.0, So the whole time was trying to time it for when Ryan was talking about
1457.0,1458.0, Jaws.
1458.0,1460.0, I'll give it a no word review.
1460.0,1461.0, Wow.
1461.0,1462.0, Let's get a drop of juice on it.
1462.0,1463.0, I said some kind of new load.
1463.0,1464.0," Well, it's like Chinese food."
1464.0,1466.0," Yeah, they won't have done that in Johnny Wilson's day."
1466.0,1467.0, It's like a sweet and sour.
1467.0,1469.0, Ben said no.
1469.0,1470.0," No, you're just wallowing."
1470.0,1473.0, Johnny Wilson wouldn't have farted as podcast.
1473.0,1475.0," Well, we had class back."
1475.0,1476.0," We are, we are a class."
1476.0,1477.0, I didn't tell you.
1477.0,1478.0, Wow.
1478.0,1479.0, Okay.
1480.0,1481.0, What do they say?
1481.0,1482.0," Suddenly, it's like, I was a radio."
1482.0,1485.0," That was like, you've got like whatever like the nipple gate."
1485.0,1486.0, And then you were this.
1486.0,1489.0, I saw the expression on your face before I saw what you were doing.
1489.0,1491.0, It's like something's wrong with Sean over there.
1491.0,1494.0," He gets her often like, like Ryan is just like,"
1494.0,1495.0," He's like, right up."
1495.0,1497.0, It's like the boreb on me again.
1497.0,1498.0, All right.
1498.0,1500.0, Let's try to move on beyond that horrible.
1500.0,1502.0, But the number of what we were talking about.
1502.0,1503.0, Everyone carry on.
1503.0,1504.0, Moving on.
1504.0,1507.0," Hey, that sounded like the project runway guy."
1507.0,1508.0, What's that?
1508.0,1509.0, You're just a virus.
1509.0,1510.0, You watch it too.
1510.0,1513.0, I never want to think for a project runway guy.
1513.0,1514.0, That's my favorite.
1514.0,1515.0, We've just added Sean.
1515.0,1518.0, I think anyone who basically has a significant other.
1518.0,1519.0, You're pretty sure.
1519.0,1520.0, You're pretty sure.
1520.0,1521.0, I'm watching that.
1521.0,1522.0, Okay.
1522.0,1523.0, It's okay.
1523.0,1524.0, It's make it work.
1524.0,1525.0, Yeah.
1525.0,1526.0, All right.
1526.0,1527.0, We all watch it.
1527.0,1528.0, Rachel.
1528.0,1529.0, All right.
1529.0,1530.0," Well, we're talking about."
1530.0,1531.0, Should we go to the next?
1531.0,1532.0, The project.
1532.0,1533.0," Oh, wait."
1533.0,1534.0, You see what the Chinese did to us on this podcast?
1534.0,1535.0, Okay.
1535.0,1536.0, You're talking about.
1536.0,1537.0, Why don't you talk about it?
1537.0,1541.0, Do you think that Amy likes it enough so that she would buy it on her own?
1541.0,1543.0," No, she would definitely play it though."
1543.0,1544.0, I think that's the thing.
1544.0,1545.0, It's a fun.
1545.0,1546.0, Okay.
1546.0,1549.0, But what about gamers who it's you've been working all day?
1549.0,1552.0, If you've messed around with your significant other.
1552.0,1553.0, They've gone to bed.
1553.0,1555.0, Now you've got a couple hours of game time in.
1555.0,1557.0, Are you going to want to play the Wii?
1557.0,1558.0, Hell yeah.
1558.0,1559.0, Yeah.
1559.0,1560.0, Are you seriously?
1560.0,1561.0, Yeah.
1561.0,1562.0, I'm not being skeptical.
1562.0,1563.0, I want to know.
1563.0,1564.0, There's a Zelda game on the Wii.
1564.0,1565.0, You're coming from the floor.
1565.0,1568.0," You're a closet retro not though, dude."
1568.0,1569.0, I'm not the retro.
1569.0,1570.0, He's not even causing it.
1570.0,1574.0, He's literally retro not to be like a lot of the reeds.
1574.0,1576.0, He's like a lord of the retro not.
1576.0,1579.0, I thought it's time to kill yourself.
1579.0,1581.0," Oh, like he's not even smiling."
1581.0,1583.0, He's not even smiling.
1583.0,1584.0," He's like, what am I?"
1584.0,1586.0, The thing about Nintendo.
1586.0,1589.0," And everybody's always, you know, like the heaven you system coming on."
1589.0,1591.0," Everybody's like, oh, this looks really stupid."
1591.0,1592.0, Like people did that with the D.A.
1592.0,1593.0, But I know.
1593.0,1596.0," Listen, I'm probably going to have one, but I'm seriously worried."
1596.0,1598.0," Seriously, because I mean, I'm an intent."
1598.0,1601.0, I have every Nintendo system going back to the SNES.
1601.0,1602.0," Yeah, the virtual boy."
1602.0,1603.0, No.
1603.0,1611.0, But what the thing that makes me worry is when I'm playing after like an hour or two or the first couple days of having the Wii where I'm like going over this funny.
1611.0,1613.0," Look, I'm swinging a sword."
1613.0,1614.0, Right.
1614.0,1620.0," That like when it's like one in the morning and I just want to play some games, I'm going to feel like a fricking moron for one doing it."
1620.0,1625.0," And two, I'm going to be sort of resentful that I'm having to do all this like physical emotion when I just want to sit there."
1625.0,1627.0," You don't need, I mean, this was a really nice screen."
1627.0,1629.0, It shows the game breaker right here.
1629.0,1632.0, You don't need any significant range of movement when you're playing.
1632.0,1633.0," Oh, okay."
1633.0,1634.0, Okay.
1634.0,1636.0, You're with it in your lap and it would look like this.
1636.0,1637.0, Okay.
1637.0,1638.0, That looks a little odd.
1638.0,1639.0, It looks odd now.
1639.0,1640.0, It looks like a hand-on.
1640.0,1641.0, It looks like a human being.
1641.0,1643.0, It looks like a human being.
1643.0,1644.0, Yeah.
1644.0,1645.0, Okay.
1645.0,1648.0, But so you don't need to play it that way.
1648.0,1651.0," It's not, you know, that physically exhaust."
1651.0,1652.0, Okay.
1652.0,1653.0, But here's part of the problem I ran into.
1653.0,1655.0, I played it in the context of a party.
1655.0,1662.0," We got together and it was like, you know, guys and our girlfriends and majority people there were either self, you know, describe casual gamers or non-gammers."
1662.0,1666.0," So it was an interesting, like sort of focus group to see how people reacted."
1666.0,1673.0," And I think at first, everyone was really digging the idea and everyone's getting up and playing Wii Sports and, you know, they're bowling."
1673.0,1674.0, They're taking three steps.
1674.0,1677.0," I mean, they're basically on a virtual lane that they don't know that they're in a way."
1677.0,1678.0," I mean, that's cool."
1678.0,1679.0," Yeah, that's cool."
1679.0,1680.0, That's cool.
1680.0,1681.0, We're swinging golf and stuff and everything.
1681.0,1682.0, Right.
1682.0,1686.0," But then when I played in this is like, you know, just maybe the way I look at games, I was immediately,"
1686.0,1687.0," I was just like, skeptical."
1687.0,1697.0," I was like, there's no way that this processor can compute the incredible degree of subtlety in a, in a golf swing or something, for example, you know."
1697.0,1702.0," I mean, that's the kind of stuff that a programmer can spend his whole career on, you know."
1702.0,1714.0," And so I started messing with it and sure enough, I was able to minimize it by continuing to, to reduce the number of steps in the range of motion and see how I could still get the exact same response and see that while they were up there doing the swing."
1714.0,1715.0, Yeah.
1715.0,1719.0," I could just go like this and wag my wrist and it would get, and it was actually true."
1719.0,1728.0," You know, I wouldn't, I would just slice because it's basically just, there's a power meter, a swing meter in the same way that you'd have in any other game if you're just analog steak or even a mouse."
1728.0,1731.0, And you're basically filling the bar with the quick extra.
1731.0,1734.0, And it would just hit the ball.
1734.0,1740.0," But so for me, it's still, that doesn't, it's hard to, that doesn't mean that it's better anymore."
1740.0,1741.0, Right.
1741.0,1748.0," But that means, because that's the, and Zelda you'll have to like swing a sword, but even if you're doing it in a smaller range, that might still be fun, right?"
1748.0,1749.0, Yeah.
1749.0,1757.0," And you're not, and the thing that Zelda, it's not trying to replicate it for, in a one to one way in the way that people are assuming when you grab it and you're like, okay, you're playing tennis."
1757.0,1760.0," So they, that's an activity that they're familiar with, right?"
1760.0,1762.0, Much more than most people swing swords.
1762.0,1763.0, Right.
1763.0,1770.0," But so basically you're, you're jerking your hand around, just jerking it, jerking it, and anyway, like, so he does something on the screen."
1770.0,1772.0," And it, you know, I mean, and that's fine."
1772.0,1783.0," But I'm thinking that in for games when it does sort of like either just by default, it encourages you to believe that there is a one to one like an exact translation of your physical actions into virtual movement in the game."
1783.0,1787.0," He runs come to the, he runs come to the, he's trying to do that kind of bummed out by it."
1787.0,1793.0," Right. And that's the game I heard Red Steal is just like a total like, wash, especially the sword fighting stuff."
1793.0,1797.0," The same guy who, uh, I'm not gonna name names, but who that the wheels went."
1797.0,1805.0," But anyway, so what I'm getting at here is that for me, I was just kind of bummed because I was buying into all the ads you see in the promo movies, right?"
1805.0,1812.0," See the people doing backflips on their couch isn't stuff and you're like, okay, well, when I do want to get spastic, this is the perfect thing to do it."
1812.0,1819.0, It's like now that I know that all that's like spasticity is like largely extraneous that it's not really being read by the industry.
1819.0,1820.0, That's really interesting.
1820.0,1825.0, I feel it's stupid doing it. So maybe it's just me and I'm prone to not that's interesting.
1825.0,1831.0," I mean, it's sort of like there may be counting on us all sort of bringing our real life assumption into it."
1831.0,1835.0," It's due to physical, you know, that's like you get into it what you want."
1835.0,1839.0," Right, because like I watched the EGM guys all playing that bowling game on Friday."
1839.0,1842.0, And they all look like they were on like a virtual ball game.
1842.0,1843.0," But no, Joe, and it looks fun."
1843.0,1847.0," You could sit here. I think if you wanted like this, it's like, I mean, this just to be a place like that."
1847.0,1850.0," As I mean, I could be like just and right."
1850.0,1852.0, And that actually sounds like kind of the same thing.
1852.0,1853.0, That's the both worlds in the way.
1853.0,1858.0," Because like if you got four people together, you can all kind of just, you know, do that and have fun, even though you know, right."
1858.0,1860.0," And you know, intellectually the business."
1860.0,1861.0, Right.
1861.0,1862.0, Don't you think you're not helping the game at all.
1862.0,1867.0," If you invited, right, if you invited a few friends over and you put that game in, don't you think even if all four of you knew,"
1868.0,1870.0," you would just sort of do that anyway, right."
1870.0,1871.0, You would start doing it.
1871.0,1873.0, That's what we're flying on.
1873.0,1877.0," And then when it's like with the regular controller, you see, like people like trying to like,"
1877.0,1879.0," Yeah, that's what we're looking around the TV."
1879.0,1880.0, I totally do it.
1880.0,1881.0, Racing games.
1881.0,1884.0," I do it in racing games, even in shooters all lean in my share."
1884.0,1885.0, Yeah.
1885.0,1886.0," I mean, back."
1886.0,1892.0," Especially like in battlefield when people are flying the helicopters, you know, imagine just like, you're all like, you know, you're trying to do a steep turn."
1892.0,1894.0, Jerking and bacon.
1894.0,1895.0, Yeah.
1895.0,1899.0, I played a lot of test drive on limited in on my three sixties weekend because I didn't want to.
1899.0,1902.0, And I was doing a lot of turning my head with the steering wheel.
1902.0,1905.0, We didn't invite that kid over to our over to play games.
1905.0,1906.0, So we'd all just watch him.
1906.0,1908.0," We don't just like, hey, go ahead and play this."
1908.0,1909.0, I got the Sega Genesis.
1909.0,1911.0, We'd all go see something couch to the stern.
1911.0,1913.0," Like, Well, how's he doing?"
1913.0,1915.0," Or like, he has the gamepan."
1915.0,1916.0, He like moves the gamepan.
1916.0,1917.0," Yeah, that's right."
1917.0,1919.0, He basically was before his time.
1919.0,1921.0, He used to be his got him cover.
1921.0,1922.4, of the highest order.
1922.4,1924.68, So are we all gonna get a week?
1924.68,1925.52, I don't know.
1925.52,1926.52, Hell yeah.
1926.52,1926.72, Yeah.
1926.72,1929.8," Now after after I'm played it, I was kind of a"
1929.8,1932.04, first of the bombing that I didn't have it pre-order.
1932.04,1933.88," Now I'm like, when it's convenient, you know."
1933.88,1934.88, I might be a little bit less.
1934.88,1936.76," If it's months from now, if it's three or four months from now,"
1936.76,1937.4, I'll be fine now.
1937.4,1939.2, I think I'm kind of the way I feel the same way.
1939.2,1940.76, I'd say like let the hysteria die down.
1940.76,1942.6," People are gonna go, if you're trying to get a hold of it"
1942.6,1943.8," for the holidays, but it's."
1943.8,1945.28," But you're gonna camp out aren't you, Sean?"
1945.28,1945.92, We'll see.
1945.92,1946.88, We're planning on it.
1946.88,1947.88," Yeah, right."
1947.88,1948.4, Right is.
1948.4,1950.32," You camp it out, Ryan."
1950.32,1954.12, I think actually we're going to visit my parents this weekend.
1954.12,1957.52, And they live in a very small town.
1957.52,1958.8799999999999, So hoping I can get it.
1958.8799999999999,1960.6799999999998," Also, they're being released on a weekend."
1960.6799999999998,1961.56, It's Sunday morning.
1961.56,1962.6399999999999," Yeah, like Sunday morning."
1962.6399999999999,1963.32, Okay.

1969.04,1970.08, fricking tent up.

1980.9199999999998,1982.3999999999999, Wow.
1982.3999999999999,1985.3999999999999, That was a holy.
1985.3999999999999,1988.76," We need a one of your farts there, Sean."
1988.76,1989.76, I got that.
1989.76,1990.76," No, I don't want another."
1990.76,1991.76," No, no, no."

2078.84,2081.32, I'm still going to strong on company heroes.
2081.32,2084.84," But the problem with that is it's like, you know, when we talk about World of Workcraft"
2084.84,2087.84," and stuff, it's the point where it's like, now we everyone knows that we understand"
2087.84,2090.84, it's game and I'll play it regularly every week.
2090.84,2091.84, Right.
2091.84,2095.84," But I actually say, if Rainbow Six Vegas come into the PC as well, so I know it's"
2095.84,2097.52," just like, yes, I'm actually looking forward to that."
2097.52,2098.52, I'm looking forward to that.
2098.52,2102.52," And I have not been into Rainbow Six for a while, but that one looks good to me."
2102.52,2104.52," Yeah, that's looking pretty tight."
2104.52,2110.44, I can take this one brief moment to plug the first issue of games or windows the official
2110.44,2114.8," magazine, which will be on new stands tomorrow or tomorrow as a team."
2114.8,2120.76," And when I'm saying this Tuesday, November 14th is the official new stand date for"
2120.76,2122.76," games, ruined as official magazine."
2122.76,2123.76, Our own emergency.
2123.76,2125.76," Well, supplies last."
2125.76,2130.8," And in that issue of the magazine, we actually talk about PC games and not console games."
2130.8,2131.8, We promise.
2131.8,2135.2400000000002, I need to like take the time now and play flight sim.
2135.2400000000002,2136.2400000000002, I don't mean to do that.
2136.2400000000002,2137.2400000000002," Flight sim 10, you are."
2137.2400000000002,2138.2400000000002, Why do you need to do that?
2138.2400000000002,2140.2400000000002, You're a flight stick just because I know I like just.
2140.2400000000002,2141.7200000000003," I mean, I want to do it now."
2141.7200000000003,2143.7200000000003, I'm interested in planes and everything.
2143.72,2146.2799999999997," I'm like, I need to sit down and this sounds like it's successful."
2146.2799999999997,2147.2799999999997, It's got all the trainer modes.
2147.2799999999997,2151.7599999999998," We get a good computer to work, but you're actually really good point."
2151.7599999999998,2156.2799999999997, He's like the flight jockey in Battlefield 2 and stuff.
2156.2799999999997,2157.2799999999997, Yeah.
2157.2799999999997,2158.2799999999997, So I'm so lucky.
2158.2799999999997,2159.2799999999997, I know it's completely different.
2159.2799999999997,2163.4399999999996," If anyone's listening to like, oh, god, he thinks you can fly up playing in battlefield."
2163.4399999999996,2164.4399999999996, Good luck.
2164.4399999999996,2168.04, New York to Aquina in real time.
2168.04,2169.4399999999996, But I don't care about it.
2169.4399999999996,2172.8399999999997," Yeah, you guys, you guys sit inside their home cockpit."
2172.84,2173.84, And now making it.
2173.84,2174.84," Yeah, scoffing it."
2174.84,2178.2000000000003, That was the joke when Chris been from my EGM came over and he's really big in a
2178.2000000000003,2182.08, plane and stuff to the point where he'll he'll get like amateur pilot magazines and stuff.
2182.08,2184.56," And I was like, hey, man, co-op, co-op."
2184.56,2188.28, Let's let's do LA to LA X to Auckland in real time.
2188.28,2189.56," You know, you can be copilot."
2189.56,2190.56, You sleep.
2190.56,2192.56, I'll take the controls.
2192.56,2194.36, Maybe a copilot in Fightson.
2194.36,2195.36, Yes.
2195.36,2196.36, You can both fly the same plane.
2196.36,2197.36," Seriously, what would you do?"
2197.36,2198.36, Switch.
2198.36,2199.36," Yeah, so go take a nap."
2199.36,2200.36, Take a dump.
2200.6,2202.1600000000003, Your 1000 miles closer to the destination.
2202.1600000000003,2204.1600000000003, He also has the head tracking software.
2204.1600000000003,2205.6, That'd be a good to force.
2205.6,2206.6, Good thing.
2206.6,2207.6, Yeah.
2207.6,2210.7200000000003, Or get a wife off sending you got you and your buddy are sitting there.
2210.7200000000003,2212.32, You've got on your head sets.
2212.32,2213.32, No.
2213.32,2214.32, It's crazy.
2214.32,2218.2000000000003, I need there's like 10 errands to do and there's a whole bunch of garbage to clean.
2218.2000000000003,2219.2000000000003, But your wife can look.
2219.2000000000003,2221.0," Hey, I'm copilot in here."
2221.0,2224.6800000000003," She could say, hey, don't commercial a theater's make a lot of money."
2224.6800000000003,2226.28," And he said, hey, that kind of makes sense."
2226.28,2231.28, As opposed to you and your freaking gnome cruising around beaten on like party colored bears.
2231.28,2235.28, So I can numbers appear above their head when you poke at them.
2235.28,2236.28," Oh, sure."
2236.28,2238.28, Reduce it that way.
2238.28,2240.28, What more complicated than that.
2240.28,2241.28, I agree.
2241.28,2243.28, But I got these great new gloves now as a result.
2243.28,2244.28, Yeah.
2244.28,2250.28," So I think we're going to, yeah, we're going to hit."
2250.28,2251.28, Go to Darren with the news.
2251.28,2252.28, Okay.
2252.28,2253.28, So.
2253.28,2256.28, So on the console theme.
2256.28,2257.28," Oh, dear."
2257.28,2258.28, Okay.
2258.28,2259.28," No, actually."
2259.28,2260.28, Next is really quick.
2260.28,2261.28, So it's been a second.
2261.28,2265.28, So people who kind of curious about the Xbox 360's HD DVD drive.
2265.28,2268.28, Apparently it will work on a PC.
2268.28,2269.28, Awesome.
2269.28,2274.28, So if you want to try if you want to save some if you want to get a cheap HD DVD player on your computer.
2274.28,2278.28," You buy it for 200 bucks and there's some, you know, basically it's going to acquire some drivers."
2278.28,2281.28, And they found and the people at uneasysilence.com.
2281.28,2289.28," If you download the drivers and you install Wind DVD 8, which it happens to work with, you can watch HD DVD movies on your piece of stuff."
2289.28,2294.28, I need these silences named after the moment after I just crop dust it on this podcast.
2294.28,2295.28, Good.
2295.28,2298.28," It is so like, like, or if you want to hear a well PC gave us a replay."
2298.28,2299.28, Okay.
2299.28,2301.28, So so wait.
2301.28,2304.28, It goes and likened to a drive bay from part of my stupidity.
2304.28,2309.28," Well, actually, well, the way the 360's HD DVD drive is it's basically like an external"
2309.28,2311.28, HD plug into the USB port.
2311.28,2312.28," Oh, wow."
2312.28,2317.28," Internally inside the box, it's really just a toshiba OEMed HD DVD drive."
2317.28,2321.28, So it has the the drivers are available and you just have to plug it in through USB.
2321.28,2325.28," So I mean, like, there might be some stuttering if you have a low NPC, but what's what's available."
2325.28,2328.28, Like on HD DVD right now in terms of a content for it.
2328.28,2330.28," You mean besides, like, you know, RV or something."
2330.28,2331.28," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2331.28,2334.28," Well, me like, it's kind of like that the turf war is now beginning."
2334.28,2338.28, So it's like you can see like mission impossible three and I don't have the full list.
2338.28,2343.28," Actually, I think it's either extreme tech or digital life action or proper list of some of the movies that are out."
2343.28,2349.28," I don't check that, but although I actually had a conversation recently with somebody and you know, who's going to win the war between"
2349.28,2352.28, Blu-ray and HD DVD and all depends on where porn's going to go.
2352.28,2356.28, I was going to ask Ryan needs to know when his anime porn is going to be exactly TV.
2356.28,2358.28, Is really you're in the service.
2358.28,2359.28, Awesome.
2359.28,2360.28," Yeah, you know, because you're really."
2360.28,2361.28," Yeah, because you're really."
2361.28,2362.28," Yeah, that's a pretty beauty there."
2362.28,2363.28, That's.
2363.28,2364.28, It's a big.
2364.28,2365.28, Isn't that always what drives the.
2366.28,2367.28, The.
2367.28,2368.28, Technology.
2368.28,2371.28, It's a sense of sense of VHS VHS DVD.
2371.28,2374.28, The internet the first successful commercial ventures.
2374.28,2377.28," The is to be a porn porn movie theaters, right?"
2377.28,2379.28," Before if you mind, figure it out, they could do it at home."
2379.28,2380.28, True.
2380.28,2381.28, That's right.
2381.28,2382.28, I sure miss those.
2382.28,2383.28, Real.
2383.28,2384.28, For all moving.
2384.28,2386.28, All right.
2386.28,2387.28, So next thing news actually you do.
2387.28,2390.28," Ryan, you're pretty excited about this bit of news."
2390.28,2393.28," So even online developers, CCP games is merging with white wolf."
2394.28,2395.28, That's very exciting.
2395.28,2400.28, And they're making an ML game white white wolf's world of darkness.
2400.28,2402.28," Oh, well, gross."
2402.28,2403.28," Well, the."
2403.28,2404.28, Yeah.
2404.28,2406.28," So wait, they they merge."
2406.28,2407.28, They actually merged.
2407.28,2408.28, Wow.
2408.28,2409.28, So what do they have a new name?
2409.28,2411.28, I think they're operating under.
2411.28,2414.28, I'm operating under their own names for now because they both have like recognized.
2414.28,2415.28, Okay.
2415.28,2416.28, Chises.
2416.28,2418.28, But I think like so for the.
2418.28,2420.28," Well, it became the CCP subsidiary."
2420.28,2422.28," So like, C.C.P is the owner."
2422.28,2423.28, Yeah.
2423.28,2424.28, I'm not quite sure how.
2424.28,2427.28," So any of those who don't know white wolf are the guys who do the vampire, the mask arrayed game."
2427.28,2428.28, Right.
2428.28,2431.28, And they also do where we'll all this other stuff.
2431.28,2433.28, So good stuff.
2433.28,2434.28, Good stuff.
2434.28,2435.28, Inspiration for large.
2435.28,2436.28, Everywhere.
2436.28,2437.28, Hmm.
2437.28,2439.28," Anyway, so Ryan, take it away."
2439.28,2442.28," You know, you don't more about the, you know anything about this world pretty much."
2442.28,2444.28, No exactly what you do about.
2444.28,2445.28, The news.
2445.28,2447.28," I mean, they're they're making a world of darkness in the mouth."
2447.28,2449.28, These are the guys who made you online.
2449.28,2453.28, And I guess they're making an evenline role playing game.
2453.28,2455.28," Like a tabletop role playing game, which makes."
2455.28,2456.28, Which plays itself.
2456.28,2457.28, Right.
2457.28,2458.28, Right.
2458.28,2459.28, Just set up the.
2459.28,2460.28, That's the other.
2460.28,2461.28, That's the other half of the equation.
2461.28,2462.28, You go have dinner.
2462.28,2464.28, You flip some cards and table and look.
2464.28,2469.28," Ryan, what kind of vampire were you and when you played vampire with your friends?"
2469.28,2473.28, We have never actually played a white wolf game.
2473.28,2474.28, Pam at a thought.
2474.28,2475.28, I was going to catch him now.
2475.28,2476.28," Oh, man."
2476.28,2477.28, You said.
2477.28,2478.28, You said it the profile.
2478.28,2479.28, I've never played.
2479.28,2480.28, No.
2480.28,2481.28, Now.
2481.28,2485.28, I play a session of a where wolf once at Dreamcatcher interactive.
2485.28,2486.28, Dreamcatcher.
2486.28,2487.28, Wait.
2487.28,2489.28, Who are the guys who made Sanitarium?
2489.28,2490.28, Dreamcatcher.
2490.28,2491.28, Dreamcatcher.
2491.28,2497.28, They had the license to to the where wolf game to the universal where wolf.
2497.28,2498.28, Universal studios were all.
2498.28,2499.28, Yeah.
2499.28,2500.28, That's that where wolf.
2500.28,2502.28, Not to launch anything because still live versus the world.
2502.28,2504.28, And they were going to make a where wolf game.
2504.28,2505.28, So I went to.
2505.28,2507.28, Dreamcatcher somewhere back east and we played a game of where wolf.
2507.28,2508.28, And it was for you.
2508.28,2509.28, Didn't you have an awesome.
2509.28,2511.28, I totally forget this.
2511.28,2514.28, I could have just for you had some kind of crazy story about one of the guys working
2514.28,2515.28, on the game.
2515.28,2516.28, Or am I.
2516.28,2517.28," Yeah, we played in the nude."
2517.28,2518.28, That's a story.
2518.28,2519.28, It's a nice form.
2519.28,2521.28, I don't know what you're talking about.
2521.28,2522.28, Okay.
2522.28,2523.28, Never mind.
2523.28,2524.28, In a very custom moment.
2524.28,2525.28, It'll come to me like three hours.
2525.28,2528.28, Are you talking about the infamous white wolf incident?
2528.28,2529.28, Well.
2529.28,2531.28, I don't think we could talk about.
2531.28,2532.28, Okay.
2532.28,2534.28, If you want to know.
2534.28,2535.28, Yeah.
2535.28,2537.28, So where you were liqueanthrope.
2537.28,2538.28," Yes, I was."
2538.28,2539.28, It was fun too.
2539.28,2541.28," The key to all these games, of course."
2541.28,2544.28, You have to have a good dungeon master.
2544.28,2546.28, As we know.
2546.28,2548.28, As I was a really good storyteller.
2548.28,2550.28, As in life.
2550.28,2552.28, So what did you do during your game?
2552.28,2554.28," You know, I was a werewolf."
2554.28,2556.28, I scratched myself.
2556.28,2558.28, I can believe.
2558.28,2559.28, Eight people.
2559.28,2560.28, Yeah.
2560.28,2561.28, Check myself for fleas.
2561.28,2565.28, You get a lot of experience points.
2565.28,2566.28, I did.
2566.28,2567.28, I leveled up.
2567.28,2568.28, Got a rabies shot.
2568.28,2569.28, All right.
2569.28,2570.28, Jeff.
2570.28,2571.28, There's a Victoria.
2571.28,2572.28, Grant Dam on the avenue.
2572.28,2574.28, And you can smell there blood in the air.
2574.28,2575.28, What are you going to do?
2575.28,2576.28, Yeah.
2576.28,2577.28, I was that kind of thing.
2577.28,2578.28, Hang in there.
2578.28,2580.28, We're going to put it on.
2580.28,2581.28, Okay.
2581.28,2583.28, Speech needs to be one of those.
2583.28,2584.28, So all right.
2584.28,2585.28, What else in the news?
2585.28,2586.28, Other Sloaners.
2586.28,2588.28, But I'll just get all the stuff just rattle through these really quick.
2588.28,2589.28, So for two.
2589.28,2591.28, I think it's a very special tech nerd corner.
2591.28,2596.28, So big news last week was in video announced the direct the first direct X 10 compatible cards.
2596.28,2597.28, Yay.
2597.28,2598.28, Yay.
2598.28,2601.28, So actually here's one cool part despite the fact there's 600 bucks a piece.
2601.28,2603.28, The G force 800 cards.
2603.28,2606.28, So one of these cards is as powerful as 27900 G.T.X.
2606.28,2607.28, It's in SLI.
2607.28,2610.28," Dude, a $600 video card."
2610.28,2611.28, Exactly.
2611.28,2612.28, But you know what you think about it?
2612.28,2613.28, A year ago.
2613.28,2614.28, A year ago.
2614.28,2615.28, People PlayStation 3.
2615.28,2616.28, Yeah.
2616.28,2617.28, There are a goal.
2617.28,2620.28, People were being asked to buy two graphics cards for this level of performance.
2620.28,2621.28, So technique rights.
2621.28,2622.28, It's an improvement.
2622.28,2624.28, But that's a lot of money.
2624.28,2625.28, It's asking a lot of money.
2625.28,2628.28, There is a GTS version of this.
2628.28,2629.28, 8800 board.
2629.28,2631.28, And it's going to cost 450 dollars.
2631.28,2632.28, I think approximately.
2632.28,2633.28, It'll still be pretty.
2633.28,2635.28, It'll still be a good performer.
2635.28,2636.28, And it'll be direct X 10 ready.
2636.28,2637.28, I say give it a few months.
2637.28,2639.28, It's obviously going to be more stuff coming down the road.
2639.28,2640.28, More direct X cards in the way.
2640.28,2643.28, But it's still kind of interesting to see performance values.
2643.28,2644.28, How much it costs?
2644.28,2645.28, Yeah.
2645.28,2646.28, How much is the price?
2646.28,2647.28, How much is it?
2647.28,2648.28, How much is it?
2648.28,2649.28, And I think that's the price.
2649.28,2651.28, So it's going to be $600 video card.
2651.28,2652.28, Yeah.
2652.28,2653.28, And then I'll go back to that.
2653.28,2655.28, So you could buy a whole PS3.
2655.28,2656.28, Yeah.
2656.28,2657.28, If you could find one.
2657.28,2658.28, Yeah.
2658.28,2659.28, If there was anything good to play with.
2659.28,2660.28, Yeah.
2660.28,2661.28, Did I send you guys the link?
2661.28,2662.28, Did I send you guys the link?
2662.28,2663.28, Did I send you guys the link?
2663.28,2665.28, Did I send you guys the link?
2665.28,2666.28, Did I send you guys the link?
2666.28,2667.28, Did I send you guys the link?
2667.28,2669.28, Apparently on eBay.
2669.28,2672.28," Some dumbass bought it at PS3 for $9, $9, $1,00."
2672.28,2673.28, What?
2673.28,2674.28, Yeah.
2674.28,2678.2000000000003," I don't know if I mentioned this last week, but apparently this guy has invented a"
2678.2000000000003,2685.0," throwable controller. Oh God. Oh well we could all use that. You mean, yeah. You mean for when you get mad?"
2685.6400000000003,2690.28," No, but although it that would be even better. Okay, so I'm just going to read this as quoted from"
2690.28,2694.36," New Tech. Okay, so a new scientist tech a new breed of throwable game controllers could turn"
2694.36,2699.6400000000003," computer gaming into a healthy pastime, a possible peripherals, a break. Each controller resembles a"
2699.72,2704.92," throwable object like a ball, football, phrase B. They also connect via Wi-Fi and each contains an"
2704.92,2711.4," accelerometer capable of detecting speed and impact altitude, a timer and a GPS receiver so you could find it afterwards."
2712.04,2718.04," What? I don't know. I mean, obviously you have to be outside away from your computer to actually"
2718.04,2721.8799999999997," you. What? There's like a game where you would like throw your controller, what like a baseball?"
2721.8799999999997,2726.8399999999997," I don't know. I mean, stupid. It's stupid to say. I think it's a big illusion that it got the"
2727.6400000000003,2734.2000000000003," the pitching games or like it's like a sort of run after the end thing. Exactly. No, it's always going to be connected to a rope or an elastic"
2734.52,2739.96," This is just suck yourself in the head after throwing the head. That's great. Yeah, what have you ever said? I want to see an application of that."
2739.96,2746.44," That's not just throwing a football because call me skeptical on that one. Yeah, exactly. In Tendo and Benadette technology"
2747.48,2754.04, But decided not to pursue it however has everybody in here thrown their controller in anger. Oh hell yeah
2754.2,2759.0, There and I know for sure haven't done that my birthday election that you know that reminds me
2759.0,2764.04, We need to post a video that angry German kid. Oh that is awesome. We have to pause it. I threw my
2764.44,2769.72," Xbox 360 controller this weekend. You threw your game. Yeah, well, then I threw the game."
2769.72,2774.2799999999997, Which that one that that's what got me. I did about the lawyers like getting up opening up. Yeah
2775.08,2780.92," Xbox 360 yeah, that was the best and then throw like you know why I did that it's because I threw the control or first"
2781.4,2785.7200000000003, And then like the battery thing came open in the batteries went flying out and then the thing came up
2785.7200000000003,2790.28, Please reconnect your Xbox 360 connect. There's like oh shit. I'm gonna break the test drive
2791.0,2797.32, Now I'm now dead rising really so then after after I fix the controller and I thought a little sheepish about
2797.88,2800.52, losing my temper and telling the controller then I got mad again
2801.08,2803.88," And I want to throw the controller again, so I just took it out under the game"
2803.88,2807.32, So I had to hit the eject button on the game and then I took it and I tossed the disk
2807.6400000000003,2812.36, Just get out of here. Wow get out of put pen in a scratch screw you into the
2814.04,2817.0, Then I actually turned the controller off and took my dog for a while
2818.1200000000003,2822.28, This is a good way not having fun anymore. I remember I was just a stained level of anger
2823.6400000000003,2826.92, Huge amount of rage once and I think it was because it was a game. I was reviewing it midnight
2826.92,2833.32, Cloth was so pissed off. I remember I was playing with a steering wheel controller and I was like I kept losing it
2834.28,2837.6400000000003, And finally I just I ripped the steering column out and like
2838.76,2843.8, So I said oh shit. I put I put it right back in and you got you kept working and then and then all of a sudden I'm like oh fuck it
2843.8,2847.8, I just I actually committed to breaking the thing I said I'm gonna break this mofo I actually just like
2848.84,2850.44, I think it off I just like sort of raging
2851.0800000000004,2852.28, Totally like
2852.28,2857.6400000000003, The Germany ain't got nothing on me. There's something there's something just drugs for this. There's something wrong with that when you're doing that
2857.96,2862.1200000000003, I mean I thought like an utter moron. It was a Sunday afternoon the sun was out
2862.6,2866.7599999999998, And I'm like yelling at my three six zombie throwing the controller
2868.04,2870.04, It's time to stop gaming
2870.7599999999998,2876.3599999999997, I know I was doing it for fun quote unquote. I was taking a break from every like playing sorry or something with your kid
2876.3599999999997,2879.0, Just like lift up the board and throw all the pieces and when I was a kid
2879.3199999999997,2881.64," With your yeah, oh my god"
2883.48,2885.48, Fine you win
2885.48,2887.48, Sorry
2887.48,2891.4, Listen the teach the kid. Yeah. Oh sure you win bitch
2892.76,2898.12, You're grounded you're ready for Xbox live then they'll make you break stuff because when those kids are yelling at you
2898.12,2900.68," Not only are you losing or kicking your ass? No, we're rovin it into you"
2900.68,2905.08, And the worst thing if you have the camera they get to see them make fun of you. I like on top everything else
2905.4,2909.4, The stupid thing is too. You're really good. Why would they have the camera because as it is
2910.04,2914.36, The Xbox live head set is the dumbest thing you could put up to your head this side of the shotgun
2914.6800000000003,2916.6800000000003, I
2916.6800000000003,2918.6800000000003, Video is a good end copy there
2919.7200000000003,2921.7200000000003, Video to go along with that
2921.7200000000003,2926.2000000000003, You know I was gonna ask you that when you were talking about gears of war and listening to the people trash talk you
2926.6,2928.76," I don't have to wear that thing. No, so"
2929.4,2934.84, So people could be like this and me or whatever and I just don't have to hear it the problem is is if you're you know
2934.84,2939.8, The people on the other team can only talk to you in between maps or during you know during the loading and stuff
2939.8,2944.1200000000003," Okay, so you don't want to if you take it off altogether you're this a significant disadvantage"
2944.2,2950.04," You can't talk to your team. It's like it's a game. Okay, I mean just massively massively about working together"
2950.04,2951.4," Okay, your team"
2951.4,2957.08," So who's kind of a disadvantage and I'm sure you could probably I haven't figured it out, but I'm hoping you can go and mute people"
2957.64,2959.96," Yeah, I don't know if I want to play even with"
2960.44,2964.68, teammates like with the headset while my wife and kid are awake
2964.68,2967.16, I just feel it's too pathetic and the thing that's
2967.16,2970.6, I know where they are on my wife's just gonna keep going like who are you talking to?
2970.68,2972.6, Have you crank up the button and then like you don't have to like in the past
2972.6,2975.7999999999997," Yeah, it's like if it's team speak you can make it so you press a button"
2975.7999999999997,2981.3199999999997, That way like every like cough and sputter that that you've got doesn't like go through to everyone
2981.3199999999997,2985.3199999999997," You know so it's like you just press the button when you want to say hey, let's do this. Okay, and then"
2985.72,2991.7999999999997, It's also you know really easy to mute other people if you don't like hearing him and in general people will talk now and then but like not the whole time
2991.96,2995.72, Mm-hmm. Where's on the Xbox it's like a constant flow of just
2996.6,2997.7999999999997, You know
2997.8,3001.88, Maybe it's just it's a sign of getting older to you. I was like man. I feel old because it's like you know
3001.88,3006.04, And you get to the age and you're like was that the last like person you want to hang out with on earth and it's like
3006.28,3008.92, Someone between like 14 and 18 years old
3009.0800000000004,3011.8," Well, I think we don't love them all who"
3012.6800000000003,3014.6800000000003, Let's make now
3014.6800000000003,3016.6800000000003, Great
3016.6800000000003,3020.52, This is just on a fight against with you the 14 to 18
3021.0,3024.6000000000004, That sounds like the freaking red-haired kid on a Christmas story when he's laughing
3025.0800000000004,3027.0800000000004, You know that
3027.88,3029.88, Yeah
3029.88,3031.88, Like that
3033.88,3039.32," That's the kid so no. I don't want to discriminate by age across everyone but yeah, you're that kid"
3039.88,3047.0," You can be 30 and be that your I guess. Yeah, you can you can I think the odds are significantly less that you will be 30 and be that"
3047.0,3049.0, Jack has
3049.0,3051.0, So just play any odds basically
3051.0,3055.48," Hopefully all right questions. Oh, yeah, we have a lot of reader questions"
3055.96,3060.92, Now we're gonna read some of who marked me. We are here. We are um writing you fielding that one
3061.64,3067.08, I have a whole bunch of questions from Bowley Ryan's corner a lot of it
3067.08,3068.28, It's Ryan
3068.28,3070.28, We do a little theme song for Ask Ryan
3071.72,3073.2400000000002, A lot of it's feedback from
3073.2400000000002,3075.2400000000002, First issue. Okay. Does it burn?
3076.52,3078.52, Okay
3078.92,3084.76," He asks this is Bowley yeah, this is our our fan Bowley what a Bowley mess is mess is bored"
3084.84,3091.5600000000004," He's pretty much like our mascot he sent his postcards of his vacation to uh, what was it since an ad year something last week"
3091.5600000000004,3095.88, magically was pretty weak he sends us like just random postcards for more of his at the moment
3096.6800000000003,3098.28, Bowley I'm just playing if you
3099.0,3103.7200000000003," If you've ever since heard this you don't I'm talking about okay. Okay. Hey, don't don't this Bowley we like Bowley we like"
3103.7200000000003,3106.92, We like Bowley or is it Bowley about the ass. Bowley
3108.0400000000004,3109.4, I don't know anyway
3109.4,3113.7200000000003, Um Ryan what is he asked he wants to think yes for the giant ad glued to the cover you're welcome
3114.6,3116.2799999999997, We made it or something this that
3116.9199999999996,3122.2, The subscribers got one of those freaking ads stuck to the front of the magazine so they can't see the actual
3122.2,3127.08, You know I really hate how companies do that. I was like selling it's like they couldn't get the the cover of the magazine
3128.2799999999997,3131.72," Uh, through edits and now they have to edit don't this the advertisement"
3131.72,3135.72," All right, we love them. I love you guys. Sorry and Bowley ask you"
3135.72,3142.04," When it has that gummy glue that just rolls off. Yeah, that's true. I think he he thanked us"
3142.12,3145.48, He was being sort of half facetious because the fake cover
3146.12,3149.24, Saved the actual cover from getting ruined in the rain. Yeah
3150.84,3154.04, What I lost my voice from doing the Christmas story kid
3155.16,3162.52, Well Bowley also asked was the dragon age dragon breathing fire on the cover a subtle nod to the cover of the first issue of CGW
3162.52,3167.96, In fact good call a Bowley Bowley it was in fact an homage to the first cover
3168.04,3174.12, I mean we had that dragon image anyway as one of the possible choices for the first cover
3174.12,3180.36, But we did think that it was cool and Sharon depotists that had actually matched the cover of the very first CGW
3180.36,3186.04," So we did think about that. Yeah, it seemed like a good way to start over something wasn't the soul deciding factor by any"
3186.28,3188.76, It was not the soul can endure it reckoning. Yeah
3190.44,3194.36," All right, and here's a little bit more I involved question also from Bowley"
3195.0,3201.8, I was reading Gladstone I'm on to two back where Darren lays down some guidelines from misbehaved PR people
3202.76,3209.96," Wow, where do we go with this one guys? I want specifics now. I want to hear what I'm naming names the worst PR stories you guys have"
3209.96,3215.48, I want to stories that you scare your kids with around the campfire the stories that make you want to cancel your membership
3215.48,3220.6400000000003," To the human race the stories that can you get growing me cry? I'd say yeah, we all have a man"
3220.72,3226.08, There's so many crazy ones you know without mentioning like the names of the PR people or the actual games themselves
3226.48,3231.08," It's kind of hard, but I'd say like my favorite is the story of scooter on the phone"
3231.08,3236.72," Yeah, I agree that's probably the worst one we have to just do this with that names because this is all past history"
3237.3599999999997,3240.56, But right scooter Terry Nguyen who now works at
3241.3599999999997,3244.24, official PlayStation magazine we had sent him down to
3245.68,3247.68, a city
3247.68,3249.68, To do a cover story on a game
3250.64,3253.68, This was our going to be our exclusive preview of
3254.64,3258.96, This game we had worked it out with the company that we were gonna do the exclusive preview
3260.08,3266.48, And the very day that scooter had gotten on the plane and flown down or flown somewhere to see this game
3267.92,3269.92, Robert coffee another former
3269.92,3273.92, CW editor walked in that very morning with
3274.64,3279.52, a copy of our main competitors new issue that he had just bought off the new news stand
3280.64,3286.64, On their cover was that very game that scooter was going to see for our exclusive first look
3287.2,3288.4, So
3288.4,3294.72, We saw this and I had to send out a big WTF email to the PR person like are you kidding me?
3295.2,3301.92, We have a guy going there right now for the look first look at the game that's now on our competitors cover
3302.48,3306.7999999999997, My favorite those you love the Mr. Schooter as his interest right he was in transit
3306.8,3311.04, So I called his cell phone while he was on the plane and told him to just as soon as he heard this message
3311.04,3313.28, Just get back on the freaking plane and come home
3313.28,3316.32, You are not to visit that company or see that game you really do them
3316.32,3319.28," Yeah, you're like if you can't come back right away go to Disney world do whatever you want"
3319.28,3321.92, But you are not that company was anywhere near Disney
3323.92,3324.96, Or
3324.96,3326.96, What is it send us see to point or
3328.0,3329.2000000000003, This one or wherever
3329.2000000000003,3330.1600000000003, Was bought in
3330.1600000000003,3334.4, So that's what he did he heard the message any flew right back and
3334.7200000000003,3339.28," Yeah, we got into a big pissing match with the company over the definition of what a first look is"
3340.48,3347.36," So but yeah, that was a fun not to there in their mind, you know, they they meant first hands on"
3348.32,3350.32, So they didn't think we would mind that
3350.32,3354.32, It's the other max it's the most it seems like most of these screw-overs happen around cover stories
3354.32,3357.6, I mean like there was one that where I what I had flown internationally and
3358.08,3361.6800000000003," We were just nailing down the last bits of the cover story. I you know, I had already written it"
3361.7599999999998,3366.08, We kind of like we're at we're beyond that point of no return and same Glenn deal milk main competitor
3366.08,3368.08, They had given a
3368.3199999999997,3370.3199999999997, Basically all the information that we had
3370.96,3372.24, And yet I
3372.24,3375.7599999999998," Got on this whole journey across you know, I have across the world to see it"
3376.24,3380.16, far more offensive to me is the issue of access access to developers
3381.12,3383.3599999999997, Where's I mean like the exclusive thing is like
3383.3599999999997,3385.3599999999997, Oh
3385.3599999999997,3391.6, When a PR person is basically the soul and then only you know the official and the
3391.68,3398.16, The basically the only but guilty of the game you have yeah to to the people in the development team and
3399.3599999999997,3404.3199999999997, When they all when they constantly set the conditions under which you can speak with them whether or not you can
3404.3199999999997,3408.8799999999997," Often it's you know, they're not speaking to anyone even in cases where it turns out in other snares at the"
3408.8799999999997,3415.52, Personal to talk to you but it's just it's just troubling for me because I mean part of the thing we fight for is to do something other than just
3415.52,3419.92, De facto advertising and it's always in you know PR is interest to have you know
3419.92,3424.16, Story on their game say exactly you know what they want it to and and read like an advertising
3424.16,3427.84, I want to let it that and you do approach some and this is you know
3427.84,3432.32, I don't want to paint a two-brother brush because so many PR people are wonderful and they completely get it a lot of
3432.32,3436.8, Totally out of their way and the in ways that they probably have to explain to their peers
3436.8,3441.92, Why I'm taking my time to do this but when we want to have stories that aren't just based on hey
3442.0,3445.84," Here's this game eventually one day you're gonna want to go buy it, but like let's look at like"
3445.84,3452.48, You know what's going on in gaming in this and that but it so it can be a real pain in the ass when when someone doesn't see anything other than
3452.7200000000003,3456.76, Is it a preview is it a review will then I don't understand what you're talking about you can't talk to someone
3458.04,3461.76, And then other things which I don't want to get into too much because we don't want to talk about it
3461.76,3463.76, But when when PR people want to
3464.2400000000002,3469.76, Talk to you about scores in a way that's just kind of like kind of close across to the line that they're entitled to tell
3469.76,3475.0400000000004, I just turns off as soon as they do that the thing about the access I totally agree with you
3475.0400000000004,3480.6400000000003," But it makes me wonder and not to defend them, but I'm sure it must be the same like in every entertainment industry"
3480.6400000000003,3484.2400000000002, Right if you want to interview an actor or director something
3484.2400000000002,3487.76, Just maybe if he or person stand in his eye making sure you don't ask anything
3487.76,3492.2000000000003," Right, but you know it's like if it's cool if you know if they were to stand by and say"
3492.2000000000003,3496.8," Oh, no, you can't ask that question right, but if they're actually holding up the entire interview process because"
3496.96,3499.38," Right, they won't let you they won't grant you access to that"
3499.38,3508.7400000000002, The thing that Sean is alluding to I think which is which is fresh which was definitely frustrating was when we had questions for some developers that actually didn't even have to do with any specific game
3508.7400000000002,3514.1, We just wanted to ask him general philosophical game questions and we were getting the I'm sorry
3514.1,3519.2200000000003, They can't we're not talking about that right now. It's like you're not even listening to what we're saying we're asking
3521.02,3522.98," Exactly, I totally agree and another time"
3522.98,3528.68, Other people that want to screen any questions you're going to ask the person in advance like you know
3528.68,3532.08," Darren alluded to and you know, you know, they want to make sure that you know"
3532.58,3535.5, It's in a way that's not just a matter of the person being ready
3535.5,3538.7," So when they do talk about it, they can offer you more insightful and throw responses"
3538.86,3542.54, But more just a matter of them making sure you're not going to go into any territory
3542.54,3546.42, That's not immediately advantageous to their their bottom line. You know the thing that's crazy too
3546.42,3547.94, I mean this is not
3547.94,3549.94, International politics
3549.94,3556.26," You know we're not covering CIA's handles it's freaking games. Yeah, you know that the level of secrecy is a bit ludicrous"
3556.42,3561.3, You know we just want some questions about your stupid game
3561.42,3565.26, It's not that important in this in our grand scheme
3565.26,3567.26, We have true you
3567.26,3570.46, You're game that are about you know someone as a person so what's what they're doing
3570.46,3575.38," Yeah, yeah, they understand their career in this and that right and also it's just to bring up one quick point"
3575.38,3579.18, I think we've had a brother so a couple podcasts ago was how I think another part of this whole
3579.54,3582.98, larger PR issues. It's not even the PR people's fault. The sometimes like
3583.66,3588.0, PR and marketing are getting confused and like their marketing department is like kind of I wouldn't say
3588.0,3592.64, LinkedIn takes me definitely operate under this assumption that we are they are marketing department as well. Oh
3592.64,3597.22," Definitely and that's and that's probably the biggest problem is that yeah, they act as though. Oh"
3597.8599999999997,3600.94, We wanted you to talk talk about this this and this right well
3600.94,3602.18, We recently had the example
3602.18,3606.5, I don't think we talked about this on the podcast where a game company was having an event
3607.34,3610.06, A scheduled event that they set up for their game
3610.7,3618.5, because they were ready at this point to give coverage to it and so they invited all of the media down the gaming media to see this game
3619.22,3622.76," And we declined and it come get your preview. You know, we're right there like"
3622.76,3625.14," Hey boys, we're ready for coverage now"
3625.14,3631.3, So everybody come visit us and get and write up your previews and we bought and it wasn't to be
3632.14,3636.46, It wasn't to be whole year than now or or just whatever
3636.5,3638.98," You know, but we didn't do it because"
3640.74,3646.22, Usefulness so like right every other websites gonna have the same thing that's a story not only it's gonna be on every website
3646.22,3650.02, And then three weeks later it will be in every magazine and it's going to read
3650.02,3655.82, You know almost identical in every instance because that's gonna be a matter of here's where we were here's what they showed as furses
3655.82,3659.62, What we tried next which is exactly what they want. I mean they just decided
3660.62,3666.46, Very carefully right and we basically said you know what just because you're ready for us to write about
3666.5,3669.94, Your game doesn't mean we're ready. It's actually we're not part of your PR site
3669.94,3675.14," By it's like buying an advertisement, but that's gonna run in every single publication and online"
3675.14,3679.5, It's a brilliant strategy in addition and furthermore than instead of just an advertisement
3679.5,3684.76, It's backed by editorial that's right in which case it's people going to like drop their their garbage free
3684.76,3686.8, Adterie with when they approach an advertising
3686.8,3690.88," Yeah, so if they if they set that up and everybody goes more power to them"
3691.22,3695.02," Yeah, that's in there that's perfectly in their interest to do so"
3695.2599999999998,3700.02, Right the thing is is we have to play on our interest to go say we've got those pages
3700.02,3703.22, We can give to something that we don't think is gonna appear everywhere
3703.22,3707.82," Uh-huh that we're gonna have a different kind of access to it, you know, and then at least we're offering"
3707.82,3710.86, We're doing some service to our readers by offering them something
3710.86,3713.86, It's I mean they can read that story in every other place like you said
3713.86,3717.42, But what bothered me was a little bit of the attitude we got back from them
3717.42,3721.94," Which was like oh, so you guys are too good for this. Yeah, and that was like the case at all. No, no"
3721.94,3724.88, And we've told we said we'd love to see some other aspects of this game
3724.88,3729.04, We're in a context where it's not us in a room with a thousand other people where every you know
3729.62,3734.18," Question it with that we ask and you know, we have to share the response with everyone else and that's not new"
3734.18,3735.46, And so that's it always like
3736.66,3738.38, These kind of junket things and that's one thing
3738.38,3743.7400000000002, I always kind of know him he's like having a demo with like five other people and like my question like if I had asked a question
3743.7400000000002,3745.7400000000002, Let's like this the same answer
3745.7400000000002,3749.88, Question is everyone's question right so I mean I would I would go out of my way to like wait till the
3749.88,3753.88," Conference was over you know, whatever was going on and walk up to the developer and just"
3754.44,3759.82," Basically ambush him with my own question. Yeah, I just sort of in general really resent this like we're ready for coverage now"
3759.82,3762.54, Come to our event and then they get mad when we don't go
3762.7000000000003,3767.92," Right, you know what we actually decide what's gonna go in the magazine. Yeah, yeah, do you have a bunch of"
3768.56,3776.04, How does it do you play along well? That's why it's acceptable because they're the problem because it's almost everyone plays along and
3776.56,3779.48, And it's it's been the sort of the status quo for so long
3779.88,3785.6800000000003, It's why it really it's laziness really the car person of course was taken a back because I mean that's why they understood
3785.6800000000003,3791.4, They almost understandably read it is some some kind of weird thing on our part because they just weren't had never encountered
3791.4,3797.2400000000002, Before at least we were leaving believe by that by the way that we're even after I thought that the incident was over like a couple days later
3797.2400000000002,3799.34, I got to come out like you know
3799.34,3805.12," Oh well since you guys are too good for this now sort of thing and I was like what yeah, that wasn't what it was about"
3805.12,3807.12," Yeah, you know"
3807.12,3812.64, We want to cover your game. I don't want to do you know your schedule PR plan for you. Sorry
3812.92,3815.52, That's your agenda is not my agenda. Yeah
3816.12,3819.52, More and more in the future depending on how things go. I mean they're welcome at time
3819.52,3823.8399999999997, I think when we all have to talk about we'll all have to air the dirty laundry of like how
3824.4,3827.88, Some PR people want to know too much about scoring inner
3828.48,3833.3199999999997, Too forceful and suggesting that things would be changed to two different things and stuff like that
3833.3199999999997,3836.88," You know what you did now, but I swear though at some point if it continues"
3836.88,3839.8, It will be just a matter of I mean that's just bad practice
3839.8,3842.2400000000002, We've got to talk about it. I have to complete that on the have taken
3844.12,3846.12, It's $50 a star
3847.12,3848.4, A lot of my we should not
3849.6800000000003,3857.12," Yeah, those are old rates a lot of my PR night mirrors come from you know scores talking about the scores. I've had CEOs of companies"
3858.08,3860.08, You make a one-off race to
3860.08,3866.2000000000003," Complain that our low score is dragging down the game rankings average. Yeah, that's what it's always about right"
3866.2,3869.96, It's always about how we are versus medicritic or game ranking
3869.96,3874.68, I actually take game rankings in the consider to which I say fuck game rankings and fuck medicritic
3874.68,3878.04," Yeah, well, yeah, I think agreed all around here y'all"
3878.04,3881.8799999999997, It's like and again a lot of publishers and a lot of PR people like poster lease where I and
3882.16,3888.52," They'll come to you and they want to talk to you, but it's only it's in a really like terms that I'm happy with"
3888.52,3892.68," No, I'm names in this case were like before after reading a few EA games"
3892.68,3896.8399999999997, They've come over and they wanted to talk and it was clear they brought the developers the PR post steps away and
3897.24,3902.2," They just let me say it they don't challenge what I'm saying they say, but but you're wrong because what about this or"
3902.2799999999997,3907.64, They're not grilling me to try to see how well I know it or if I if I if they catch me in an air someplace
3907.7999999999997,3909.7999999999997, They just sit there and take notes
3909.7999999999997,3911.48," Yeah, you know it that's different you know"
3911.48,3912.9199999999996, That's you know that's totally cool
3912.9199999999996,3917.56," Yeah, it's much more collaborative experience because like you can actually give proper feedback and so"
3917.56,3919.7599999999998," Okay, here's what you can do for next time to do that"
3919.7599999999998,3920.7599999999998, That's a lot different
3920.84,3925.4," It's actually point you know, there's a point to it. Yeah, and then the other time is still come and it's quick"
3925.4,3930.36, It's clear right off the bat. They're gonna give you that you know a third degree and they're trying to like trip you up
3930.36,3934.28, They're trying they just want to argue with you. Tell you where wrong. You know what you're wrong and and and
3934.6000000000004,3939.1200000000003, When the person telling you you're wrong is someone who hasn't even played the game to PR person has been played the game
3939.1200000000003,3941.48," So yeah, I could go to hell, you know"
3941.48,3943.48, Straight up just go hell
3943.88,3948.36," But yeah, actually I was saying like in EA's case. I'm not we mentioned the name of the game or there's a"
3948.36,3950.6600000000003," Yeah, I mean, I've done it. I did very live on a rising son"
3950.6600000000003,3954.6," Well, it was for 242 in particular because I remember at the yeah, I did talk them for that"
3954.6,3959.4, Right because I remember like at the at their EA showcase over this past summer before 242 came out
3959.4,3964.08, We had a play test demo of it and their PR guy pulled me aside and you know what he's a totally cool guy
3964.08,3966.84, And he totally gets it like we sat there and like he asked me what I thought of it
3966.84,3971.08, I broke down some of the issues I had with the with the game and what I thought could be done to make it better
3971.08,3977.2400000000002, And they totally took it as his was intended like constructive criticism and I think that was the same case
3977.24,3980.7599999999998, With the game from the fact you know the developers themselves
3981.7999999999997,3985.3599999999997, Though of course many of them get very angry because this is their babies
3985.3599999999997,3988.9599999999996, And I know it's from lockdown. I see a lot of a lot of them do
3989.9599999999996,3995.1, Understand I think a lot better actually than if he are in marketing people and in fact again
3995.1,3998.7999999999997, We talked about this a couple weeks ago. I don't even know if you can really blame the PR people
3998.7999999999997,4001.7999999999997, It goes higher than that. It's like the pressure from above
4002.04,4005.8799999999997, You know to do well because of game rankings because of sales right right
4005.88,4014.32," Yeah, totally companies can do things to incentivize foul play though by like offering bonuses to PR people based on the scores that the games that they handle get in this and that"
4014.32,4017.96, And that goes well that's the end of the above. That's a cough from above
4017.96,4023.36, Right is setting really bad precedent because you take as we discussed in our podcast a few times before
4023.36,4026.7400000000002, Someone who has no control over quality of a game
4027.08,4032.2400000000002, It's saying the entertaining and painting the financial profit on the ending quality
4032.2400000000002,4034.2400000000002, the fact that that prep
4034.9599999999996,4040.24, Actually even exists boggles my mind that someone would actually think that they could influence a score
4041.04,4042.64, Through good PR
4042.64,4044.64, Means they completely don't get it
4044.64,4046.04, I
4046.04,4049.04," Mean maybe it works for some other magazines, but definitely that also makes me think like"
4049.52,4054.12, Well working on somebody we got a we got an email from a girl one time
4054.12,4056.12, We actually published it in the magazine
4057.8399999999997,4064.2, He had emailed me saying how he was very upset that our reviewer had given this game until low school
4064.24,4071.7599999999998, And he wanted he wanted to make it out to me and he had this other game coming out that they thought was a really strong eight or nine and
4071.9599999999996,4076.3199999999997," Maybe yeah, it worked together and get an exclusive on this other game they had coming out later"
4076.3199999999997,4079.24, But wasn't that if we could re-review if we could re-review?
4079.24,4082.24," Should re-review yeah, you know what yeah, wow"
4082.52,4084.8399999999997, You mean if we re-reviewed it gave it a higher score
4084.8399999999997,4087.4399999999996, We were gonna get this exclusive on his next game. This next editor
4087.4399999999996,4089.04, He was he was also yet
4089.84,4094.36, Budget game that he was like oh we have this new product coming out that we think so really strong eight or nine
4094.36,4101.16, We're hoping you can look at it like and that's a game that like for the record has still not out and you got to see
4101.16,4103.16, Meal like you know what eight months ago
4103.16,4106.5199999999995, So that that that's how long ago he knew that is next day or nine
4108.84,4112.8," No, but yeah, actually I do remember one story from consoleville"
4112.8,4116.4," But no magazine names are publishers being mentioned, but it was a major magazine"
4116.4,4120.5599999999995, Maybe major game publisher and they said we'll give you the exclusive on this if you
4121.2,4124.599999999999, Exclusive review exclusive you on this if you promise to give it this level of score
4125.16,4127.799999999999, Right there's a lot of stories like that in the console story
4129.08,4134.2," Yeah, we don't I don't think that happens on our it's attached to the yeah, I mean with the derview covers like you've been"
4134.2,4136.839999999999, You know and that's why I'm glad we're not doing review covers anymore
4136.839999999999,4140.759999999999," Who knows if it's happened or not? I mean, I mean, I we have no idea if anyone's ever taken them up on it"
4140.759999999999,4146.08," But we do know for a fact that those offers have been made. Yeah, I would say every time we've tried to do a"
4146.08,4150.84, Review cover it's been a disaster all of the I just kind of funny the only I just thinking about it
4150.84,4155.64, Like the few times we actually we actually have done review covers there. We tool them turned into previews because their games weren't ready
4155.64,4158.68, Right we gave two three and a half stars
4158.68,4164.0," Yeah, they've got like mediocre review and one god of it was the the Sims review is the only one that was a good score"
4164.76,4165.76, Same one
4165.76,4170.88, Some two okay the funny thing about scores what we're talking about it everybody
4170.88,4177.400000000001, Contains that you know low scores equal market place failure right whereas well one one would it one would
4177.400000000001,4181.28, Assume that the reverse is true that high scores equal market place success
4181.28,4185.12, Which is clearly not the case right you know you look at it like cycling
4185.12,4190.68," Yeah, I told her it called Tommy on the PS2 right Tommy got Ray for views and I can't tanked"
4191.2,4194.0," Yeah, so like you can't really that arguments"
4194.96,4196.96," Yeah, they"
4196.96,4199.08, I think it's more like you know whichever one has the best marketing
4199.6,4204.64, That's kind of what it sounds like almost well here. Give you the best buzz before it launch and the best marketing at launch
4205.4800000000005,4210.44, So what we're saying is we actually influence game sales a lot less than people think
4211.12,4214.56," Just not worried about the scores. Don't worry about that. Even just us, but like all"
4215.12,4220.32," Oh yeah, we're doing reviews combined. We're just a we're just a lot of white noise basically it is a lot of white noise"
4220.32,4225.72, It's you know it's strictly for this insular crowd of hard car gamers to you know get some
4226.68,4232.8," Get some pre release opinions or whatever now, but yeah, doesn't we have a lot of something to be said for taking you know"
4232.8,4234.84, We're talking to launch that the approach you know
4234.84,4241.08, There's two approaches to reviews and one is consumer report and that's what I think the majority of reviews are and then an actual critique
4241.8,4247.4800000000005," Consumer reports is skewed toward you know, what a lot of people want based based on demand a lot of people just wanted to"
4248.2,4251.16, Buy it for these reasons and how does it hold up in these sectors
4251.88,4254.76, It's a very clinical ticking off of like it has this right
4254.76,4260.08, You want an actual you know a more developed critique of it the way you get with no and in other
4260.4400000000005,4263.52," No, where people have been writing about other formats for a longer much longer time"
4263.52,4264.88, Right music and
4264.88,4266.16, Can it move you review the neck
4266.16,4268.16, Go on the directing is this
4268.16,4269.16, Right
4269.16,4275.64," In the in the 13 the special effects are crap, but but the cinematography is spot on it"
4275.64,4279.24, But the guys delivers is lines so well that it's okay that you know
4279.24,4286.0, Or like if they're now here for rolling stone was the old boys about a 3.5 you know
4286.0,4292.24," About three point four seconds on the track three, but then know the trumpet comes in just kills it trumpet kills it"
4292.24,4294.24, So you're raising up to about a seven
4296.28,4301.219999999999," Yeah, we should do some CD reviews like game reviews and see what happens all you have to do"
4301.219999999999,4306.5599999999995," Yeah, or movie or tell me show anything and it would really in the body and how are betrayed is too"
4306.56,4311.360000000001, When you've got the mandatory audio when you got the audio score and then the paragraph about the audio and stuff
4311.360000000001,4313.6," Yeah, imagine there's like just a paragraph about"
4314.76,4320.200000000001, With the separate review for the audio in in borrower or something you're trying to decide if you want to go see
4324.200000000001,4329.160000000001," Yeah, okay by the way see that movie. Oh, certainly crap. Yeah, I need to see that"
4329.320000000001,4334.34," Well, those are some I don't know I'm gonna have to do some soul searching Sean after that talk about reviews"
4335.3,4341.3," Maybe we need to do a whole new system. Yeah, let's fix it here. Do we want to ask any more questions"
4342.38,4347.82, One from DS should I should I tell that PR story about the at that message that
4348.78,4354.4400000000005," PR manager shower main name was left on there in the entry machine. No, no, we're gonna move on by our"
4354.4400000000005,4355.9400000000005," Yeah, yeah, not for that stuff"
4355.9400000000005,4361.4400000000005," Okay, that's a physical but I want to wait for later. We do have lots of PR stories as you suspect it"
4361.4400000000005,4363.4400000000005," Yes, there's a ton"
4365.14,4369.26, And I'm sure they've got a million stories about people that write about games. No doubt they did
4369.26,4373.42," Oh, yeah, can I have a my 17th Red Bull and then more pretzel, please?"
4375.26,4381.58," Can you guys send us a more years of world we don't review console games, but we really like some yeah, yeah, that's all"
4383.9800000000005,4385.5," Well, here's here's a question about"
4386.3,4391.06," Microsoft's games for windows stuff. Oh, from game it tend. Okay"
4391.580000000001,4396.4800000000005," Yeah, he says I hope people answer this until next week sometime, but we'll find out. Okay. Well"
4396.4800000000005,4403.46, I'll ask it anyway. We'll see. Let's see games for windows the game should one of the things is going to do is make it easier to match a game system
4403.46,4404.9800000000005, Aquarium into your system
4404.9800000000005,4409.6," Specifically, I read that games would have a one to five rating based on how powerful of a system they require"
4409.6,4414.9400000000005, And systems would have a way to be to be graded with a one to five number as well is this true?
4414.9400000000005,4419.700000000001, And if it is how would the industry account for the fact that an over powerful system with a great of five
4419.7,4422.58, Will you come a four than a three two one up?
4423.46,4427.34, Good question. So do okay. Here's how I'm gonna choose this so
4428.099999999999,4431.3, There's this thing there's this thing that's actually a part of
4431.66,4435.9, Vista everyone's gonna fall asleep now. It's called winsat and basically think it in the back
4435.9,4439.3, I think of it in the background is something that optimizes your computer to play games
4439.3,4443.0599999999995, So it's gonna like it operates in the background doing all this stuff like tweaking settings and stuff
4443.0599999999995,4445.74, So it actually gives you the best performance for the computer you have okay
4446.0199999999995,4453.42, So I think that's what he's talking about and maybe it kind of factors into like a that kind of grading system for how powerful a PC is and
4453.42,4455.84, I'm gonna stop right there because I did my butter
4456.66,4458.74, You smell my
4458.74,4460.74, You call it a buttercomb?
4462.94,4465.82," Wow, I wasn't saying like your thing is stinky"
4466.5,4469.5," He was saying his actual breath of stink. Yeah, no, but"
4469.7,4471.74, Did you the short the short the short the short version is
4472.66,4477.94, There are they are trying to figure out ways to like basically minimize the headaches and I don't know if that's part of it
4477.94,4480.5199999999995, I'm gonna fight we're gonna fight. I really soon because it sounds like his question
4480.5199999999995,4487.54, That's was something about about this kind of grading scale like a but over time right that like if you're machine gets officially a five
4487.9,4490.78, What happens in eight months? It'll be a four or yeah
4490.78,4496.0, I know it box and you know it that's that's very true. I mean like that's one of the things that's work on
4496.0,4499.44, You can do a print out of when he was a five and hanging over just
4501.74,4504.92, You know in 2006 I was up five star
4507.32,4509.7, I do I have time for one more question. Is that it?
4510.7,4515.34," So we read the one from D s yeah go for it. Okay, do we call do we spell"
4516.62,4518.98, Splatters that what it is diarrhea splatter
4519.86,4522.42," Everything else is tapping on this. Yeah, that's nothing"
4522.98,4525.5599999999995, Diary of splatter asks do y'all
4525.5599999999995,4528.219999999999," Well, we will be able to get his name in the in the magazine"
4528.22,4532.22, Is diarrhea something we could print in the magazine. Why would we kill the print diarrhea?
4532.22,4536.46," Yeah, but I want to know is why do you sign it for a message board and call yourself diarrhea splatter?"
4536.46,4540.16," He can also brown apple. No, it's sad is one of my favorite texts part of war"
4541.900000000001,4544.38, Nice wasn't that your name over it
4545.5,4547.5," Oh, yeah"
4547.5,4549.34, Because you know they all have like code names
4549.9800000000005,4554.3, My code name a part of your special fecal edition of the GFW radio
4554.7,4556.62," All right, so down apple sauce"
4556.62,4558.62, Diaries
4558.62,4560.62, various splatter asks
4561.9,4568.98, Do y'all have any info guesses or anything on why Westwood hasn't put out anymore games like the Korean deo series or lands of lore series
4569.58,4574.86," Well, one of them a one of the reasons that they're out of business right now first"
4574.86,4576.86, Let's roll back into the machine
4576.86,4578.86, Lans of law
4578.86,4580.86," That's the other reason. Oh, ladies"
4582.22,4585.9, Yeah other than the threat of business we have another answer for
4586.7,4590.38, I just wanted to ask the court the court guys are still around and kick in their overheads
4590.38,4594.22," I don't know if they'd pet you go all right, although you know, you know, I actually remember I was just remembering this"
4594.78,4596.0599999999995, The blame on her game
4596.0599999999995,4600.38," Yep, yeah, that was actually a lot of fun. I like that. Yeah, that was pretty good back in the day"
4600.62,4604.7, It was like the most expensive game ever at the time. It was it was four CDs
4605.66,4607.66, Yeah
4607.66,4610.38, The last lands of lore. I don't I don't know
4610.9400000000005,4618.46, I have a bad association with that game because that was the one and only time I ever fell asleep during a game demo
4620.46,4624.9400000000005, Elliot shed old CDW editor and I were we're up there and it was one of those
4625.5,4631.26, One of those things were like you spent the whole day at the studio and they were showing you like all their different games
4631.26,4635.34," Everyone game after no so yeah, so it's like three a clock now so it was like you know"
4635.34,4638.46, We were already there all day and it was three so sort of like nap time
4638.78,4644.54, You know in the afternoon and there wasn't a coffee and we go into the to the art director's office for for the
4644.54,4651.34, Lansalor game and so it was already like the end of the day and we were tired and we'd seen all these other games and it was Lans of lore
4651.34,4655.02, At least I had this mod of hand voice. He did have a monotone voice and
4655.5,4660.9400000000005," Worst of all he had like a black light in this office, so it was like dark in his office and we go in there"
4660.94,4666.219999999999, And I just I kept trying I was doing the thing where I'm like pinching my arm so that I wouldn't fall asleep
4666.219999999999,4671.379999999999," You know, but after a point like and it wasn't just me it was actually Elliot to we both"
4671.66,4677.9, Not it off and the PR like there was actually that horrible moment where like the guy who was demoing the game like real
4678.54,4680.54, We had gone
4680.54,4682.54, Like the PR person had to go guys
4683.5,4685.5, So yeah
4685.5,4688.78, And then we are just like apologizing all over our server
4688.78,4693.18," Anyone actually right right and I we went through this most situation, but we weren't we weren't there nearly there for a day"
4693.18,4695.42, We don't we didn't know no no no no no no no no no

4740.86,4747.0199999999995, Just kept asking it. Can I punch Hitler in the stomach in that game? I put Hitler in the stomach in that game was Hitler actually in the game or was that?
4747.0199999999995,4750.62," No, he was like he was bored and trying to keep stuff awake or something"
4750.86,4754.0599999999995," But yeah, that was he actually figured it for me. Yeah, he had to read that would good"
