0.0,6.44, My half brother used to be a meth and methamphetamine addict.
6.44,10.64, One time went through his house and he lived on the second floor of an apartment complex
10.64,15.32," in Vista, which is known as the meth capital of the United States at the time."
15.32,20.16, The first thing I saw I walked in the door was a bunch of newspapers about an entire
20.16,24.76, Sunday's papers worth the newspapers across the floor and then an entire transmission
24.76,26.76, of a vehicle.
26.76,32.2," You know, grease up all on the newspaper so it could be worked on."
32.2,35.120000000000005, So after this he starts to show us around the place.
35.120000000000005,39.6, He was pretty proud of his apartment and we go into one of the bedrooms and there's this
39.6,43.68000000000001, big rug in the middle of the floor where like what's this rug about?
43.68000000000001,49.160000000000004, And he grabbed it by the end and whipped it right off and there's a massive hole in the
49.160000000000004,50.160000000000004, floor.
50.16,52.48, Giant fucking manhole.
52.48,55.04," And this was the second story, remember?"
55.04,59.44, And you look down it and you see the top of a car and you see you went to tools and stuff
59.44,64.16, and what he had figured out was that the garage that comes with the apartment rental was
64.16,68.92, located around the back of the building but directly beneath one of the bedrooms.
68.92,73.32, And he didn't like half of the go down the stairs and go around and go around and open
73.32,76.19999999999999, the garage door in the middle of the night when he was tweaking and wanted to work on
76.19999999999999,77.19999999999999, something.
77.19999999999999,78.19999999999999, So he got it.
78.28,79.2, I don't know what it was.
79.2,84.12, A big sledgehammer and some tools and he posted himself a hole.
84.12,88.56, But the thing was he was proud of it and he thought it was just like you know I mean we
88.56,90.36, should we should be like praising his gumption.
90.36,92.92, And so first thing he jumps down and I was there with my dad too.
92.92,94.48, That was in high school time.
94.48,96.92," He jumps down and goes, come on down."
96.92,97.92, So we go down.
97.92,101.64, We take a look at all the stuff and then we're supposed to like how he getting back up.
101.64,105.08, And he's like oh he pulls the toolbox over and you jump on this.
105.08,107.32000000000001, You get back up.
107.32,108.32, It's a platformer.
108.32,112.67999999999999," Hello, and welcome to TFW Radio."
112.67999999999999,115.44, I thought that's where you go on with that that it was a platform.
115.44,119.16, That the moral of the story is jumping puzzle.
119.16,122.39999999999999, When you run in a apartment it's good thing to find out where your garage is at.
122.39999999999999,123.39999999999999, And then drill a hole.
123.39999999999999,127.75999999999999, They get the landlord never looked under the rug or stepped on the rug.
127.75999999999999,128.76, Yeah.
128.76,129.76, When you need to fall through.
129.76,130.76, But why not a ladder?
130.76,133.16," You know, a guy with tools usually has a ladder."
133.16,134.16, I don't know man.
134.16,136.07999999999998, Because when you tweaking you got all that extra energy.
136.16000000000003,139.44000000000003, That's where that's why he's bullshit it all.
139.44000000000003,143.08, I thought you were going to say like also that there was like a hole in the roof of his car.
143.08,145.08," No, then he gets the right job."
145.08,146.08, He's right about.
146.08,150.32000000000002," No, that won't be on the kind of it's like both."
150.32000000000002,151.32000000000002, Let's go.
151.32000000000002,154.72000000000003, Go down to the tube and then let's improve your story.
154.72000000000003,155.72000000000003, Yeah.
155.72000000000003,156.72000000000003, Yeah.
156.72000000000003,157.72000000000003, And that's the problem that's true.
157.72000000000003,158.72000000000003, It's just not good enough.
158.72000000000003,159.72000000000003, That's true.
159.72000000000003,163.84, We've been getting enough story for me if it ended at the transmission in the living room.
163.84,164.84, Yeah.
164.84,167.0, It was a lot of heavy stuff.
167.0,168.36, Could he actually get it back together?
168.36,169.48, Could he only take it apart?
169.48,173.32, I doubt he could because this whole thing was my dad was trying to like rehabilitate him
173.32,174.32, and get him off of it.
174.32,176.72, And so he off the meth that isn't.
176.72,179.92000000000002, So my dad was always in the muscle cars like mo park cars and stuff.
179.92000000000002,181.24, He had a 70 Dodge Challenger.
181.24,185.24, So he got my brother like a 70 Camaro or something that he got cheap and he painted it up
185.24,186.24, for him.
186.24,189.24," And he's like, all right, we're going to take this down to the quarter mile and this is like"
189.24,190.96, going to be what we do.
190.96,192.04, And this is going to get you straight.
192.04,195.23999999999998, But instead he would go down there with this crankshaft wife.
195.23999999999998,196.79999999999998, I know he's not listening otherwise.
196.79999999999998,198.07999999999998, I want to be telling this story.
198.07999999999998,199.07999999999998, He'd be my ass.
199.07999999999998,204.16," Well, like, so they'd go down to the track and the whole time like my dad would be racing"
204.16,207.88, or something the whole time like he would just be pulling out the fucking wiring from the dashboard
207.88,208.88, and all kinds of shit.
208.88,209.88, And the car would never run.
209.88,213.44," They would always, if it did, if it might ever get it running, he'd make sure it didn't"
213.44,216.16, run by figured out if you had it.
216.16,218.16, You got to make magic.
218.16,219.16, Wow.
219.16,221.76," Now you're going to get it called in your brother's going to be like, Sean, I"
221.76,223.48, listen to the radio show every week.
223.48,224.48, It's been my connection.
224.48,225.48, It was a long time ago.
225.48,227.0," This was a long, long time ago."
227.0,231.48," And he'd been straight for years and years living in it very, very good."
231.48,232.48, Right back.
232.48,233.48, Yeah.
233.48,236.23999999999998, This is this chuck this up to the sins of youth.
236.23999999999998,237.23999999999998, Okay.
237.23999999999998,238.23999999999998, Right.
238.23999999999998,239.23999999999998, What's was what we're all about here?
239.23999999999998,240.23999999999998, Yeah.
240.23999999999998,241.23999999999998, It's a celebration of the year.
241.23999999999998,243.79999999999998," It's a year later, which is neither GFW nor radio nor radio."
243.79999999999998,244.79999999999998, No radio.
244.79999999999998,245.79999999999998, It's a sky.
245.79999999999998,246.79999999999998, Yeah.
246.79999999999998,249.23999999999998, We're going to be talking about GFW in a moment.
249.23999999999998,250.88, The initiative.
250.96,252.56, We haven't even said like who we are.
252.56,253.72, Turn was so sinister.
253.72,254.72, Yeah.
254.72,255.72, It's start with there.
255.72,257.12, It'll be talking about it.
257.12,260.44, To my left is Ryan Scott.
260.44,266.44," I'm Jeff Green, editor and chief of the PC game section of oneup.com."
266.44,268.76, Still getting used to saying all that.
268.76,271.12," Next to me is Ryan Scott, hey, Ryan."
271.12,273.44, It's not even know what the hell.
273.44,274.44, Yeah.
274.44,275.44, Ryan's five.
275.44,276.44," Oh, there he is."
276.44,277.44, Shit.
277.44,278.44, He's ruined it already.
278.44,280.68," Ryan, we didn't think Ryan was going to show up."
280.68,282.40000000000003," Hey, Ryan, I was just introducing you."
282.40000000000003,283.40000000000003, We're going to play a gag.
283.40000000000003,285.92, We are going to do a gag in which you are actually not here.
285.92,287.04," Here's your seat, Ryan."
287.04,288.96, But now he really is here.
288.96,289.96, Great.
289.96,290.96, You ruined it.
290.96,291.96, Yeah.
291.96,292.96000000000004, Hold on.
292.96000000000004,293.96000000000004, We won't let it go.
293.96000000000004,294.96000000000004," Well, go around the room while he puts his seat."
294.96000000000004,298.44, While Ryan's putting his headset on next to him is Anthony Gagos.
298.44,299.6," Check, check, check, check."
299.6,301.44, There's a bit of a rup thing.
301.44,304.04, This is the worst intro ever.
304.04,306.12," Wow, I'm the sixth chair today."
306.12,307.12, Six chair.
307.12,308.12, Yeah.
308.12,310.12, I think you've been in the bathroom doing lines.
310.12,312.12, You probably tweaking.
312.12,313.12, Don't tell people.
313.12,317.0, We got this thing we decided lunch we want because our bathroom was so dirty.
317.0,321.32," Actually matter of fact, last week, Anthony was in there."
321.32,322.32," Oh, wow."
322.32,325.8, And so we're going to take in such a monster shit that clogged the thing up he uses
325.8,327.12, iPhone to get a picture of it.
327.12,330.76," He showed me and I was upset too because it was like, if you had to go in there and"
330.76,333.92," it was your time, there's nothing to do."
333.92,336.16, So I sent this to all the men on the floor.
336.16,337.16, Was this in the handicap one?
337.20000000000005,338.16," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
338.16,339.16," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
339.16,340.16," Yeah, and I took it."
340.16,342.16, That's on I'm tinypick.com.
342.16,343.16, They let you put effects on it.
343.16,345.16, So I had like the starburst and stuff flying up on it.
345.16,347.16, Did they not flush the toilet?
347.16,350.16," No, the thing was is that someone tried to flush it and it got even worse."
350.16,352.16, It just exploded everywhere.
352.16,354.16, So I sent that around looking for a culprit.
354.16,355.16, No one was no one messed up to it.
355.16,360.52000000000004, But then what we decided today at launch was that sometimes like a dairy cooler or a meat
360.52000000000004,365.76000000000005, cooler and a grocery store will have like these enormous and heavy plastic flats.
365.76,368.48, They overlap on another and you can kind of like brush through those to get into the
368.48,369.48, cooler.
369.48,374.12, I want our bathroom road to have one of those made a wet naps.
374.12,375.84, So we never found out who did it.
375.84,381.03999999999996," We know and maybe if it's maybe it's our fourth, not our fourth guest with the fourth"
381.03999999999996,382.03999999999996, person we're going to enter.
382.03999999999996,383.03999999999996, Six chair.
383.03999999999996,384.03999999999996," Oh, Robert Ashley."
384.03999999999996,386.03999999999996," Yeah, Robert Ashley who's drinking."
386.03999999999996,388.03999999999996, I think I'm showing up at the DMV.
388.03999999999996,389.03999999999996, Robert Ashley.
389.03999999999996,390.03999999999996, Robert Ashley.
390.03999999999996,391.03999999999996, It's very cold.
391.03999999999996,395.0, Robert Ashley's drinking Indiana Jones drink today.
395.0,396.0," It's well, it's Dr. Pepper."
396.0,397.0, Awesome.
397.0,399.0," But yeah, it does have a lot of Indiana Jones."
399.0,403.28, It's exciting to be able to get a Dr. Pepper in the machine here.
403.28,404.28, Which makes it never run.
404.28,406.28, It takes like Dr. Pepper.
406.28,411.0," Yeah, but with the you know corn syrup instead of sugar."
411.0,416.64, I read you know what I read in AP article yesterday where some archaeologists were claiming
416.64,422.0, that Indiana Jones' methods are not realistic.
422.0,423.0, Do you contest it?
423.0,424.0, I read it by Ryan Scott.
424.0,425.0, Do you contest it?
425.0,428.0, I really archaeologists try not to trigger the folder.
428.0,430.0, That was a news article.
430.0,432.0," Yeah, even they were originally."
432.0,437.8," And they were talking about how you know, real archaeological digs are like boring."
437.8,439.48, Nobody commented on the news article.
439.48,441.6, I sent around it was similar.
441.6,447.64," It was about the kids, the high school kids who had gotten stoned and then went to a, they"
447.64,449.24, went to a graveyard and look on.
449.24,450.24," Oh, God."
450.24,451.24," Oh, that was old."
451.24,452.24, And then what?
452.24,456.24, So dug up a corpse and then they used the skull to make a bond.
456.24,458.24," Oh, I'm a smoke cat."
458.24,459.24, This corpse.
459.24,462.24," How does all of the seed, does it have a staff?"
462.24,463.24," No, it was over 80 years old."
463.24,464.24, I don't know what to say to that.
464.24,466.24," I mean, I read it and I was like, oh my God."
466.24,469.24, Did you just say that was similar to the AP making painting in the end of the year?
469.24,471.24," Yeah, well similar to an archaeological dig."
471.24,474.24," Oh, I was relating it."
474.24,475.24, I just wish I could hear it.
475.24,477.24, It was about his archaeological as Indiana Jones.
477.24,478.24, Yeah.
479.24,484.24," I wish I could hear the conversation leading up to them going to the graveyard, taking up a body and making"
484.24,485.24, a bond.
485.24,486.24, That's my whole thing.
486.24,488.24, What's the last thing you would want it to when you were stoned?
488.24,489.24, You would think I know.
489.24,490.24, Go to a great place.
490.24,491.24, You do all that.
491.24,492.24, How about work?
492.24,493.24, They must have been drawn.
493.24,496.24, The worms get you 16% higher.
496.24,497.24, I don't know.
497.24,499.24, It just seems like a lot of work and just kind of a bummer.
499.24,500.24, Yeah.
500.24,502.24," You know, there might be some THC left tonight."
502.24,503.24, The guys praying.
504.24,505.24," Oh, oh, oh, oh."
509.24,510.24, This is a horrible podcast.
510.24,516.24, We've already talked about taking dumps.
516.24,519.24, For about 8 minutes and has caught my episodes.
519.24,521.24,inctt 답bert out of his head.
521.24,523.24, I didn't know It started.

525.24,529.64," is that if you see dots in 280s, the 80s models know"
529.64,532.64, that whoever's driving is addicted to crystal meth
532.64,534.6800000000001," and that the codes for these vehicles,"
534.6800000000001,537.36," you can call them either crystal caravan,"
537.36,539.52," a methamel wheel, a ship sled,"
539.52,544.52," which is shit a slank for crank tweak, chicken."
544.52,549.52," A burner bonzo, anyway, keep an eye out for these vehicles"
550.36,552.92, and I'm gonna pass the mic right now.

556.52,558.28, at home what you're holding in your hands?
558.28,559.16," Oh yeah, let's get the thank you."
559.16,564.16," Sean, I'm holding, first and only GFW radio bumper sticker."

583.44,586.12," Robert Ashley aka Bobby, you don't max chill."
586.12,588.1600000000001," He, but it's mentioned, game boxes."
588.1600000000001,590.84," He has Dr. Maximum Chill, which is on top of the trauma"
590.84,591.88, centers at the same time.
591.88,592.72, Game.
592.72,593.5600000000001," Yes, drums."
593.5600000000001,594.4, Under the neck and I.
594.4,597.48," And then he's also got Ace of Turt Max attorney, Ace of Chip Max"
597.48,598.44, Jill Ace of Turtney.
598.44,602.24," Berkeley and Code Pink, it says, I just caught that."
602.24,605.2, And then there's a bunch of other races all like radiating
605.2,606.0400000000001, out.
606.0400000000001,606.6800000000001," Oh, a lot of going on to be radiating out."
606.6800000000001,607.52, It really is.
607.52,608.6," So this really, well done."
608.6,609.48, That was super cool.
609.48,610.64," Yeah, we thank you very much."
610.64,611.64, Everyone today.
611.64,615.3199999999999," Then I had to think, Devon Low, who out of the blue, I"
615.3199999999999,619.92, get a box and he sent me the Ward DVD box set by
619.92,623.28, talked about the wanting Ken Burns's DVD documentary series
623.28,626.88," and how it being, being too expensive for my taste at Best Buy."
626.88,630.56, Apparently he found it on sale on eBay for 19 bucks and hooked me
630.56,631.52," up, which is super cool."
631.52,633.88, We need to close down more often.
633.88,635.48, You have that in a lot of games.
635.48,639.68," And then, the only thing is the fourth disc of that set is"
639.68,643.8, him masturbating because he has to be radiate calling out to you.
643.8,645.4, That's just not.
645.4,647.1999999999999, That was a good gift.
647.1999999999999,648.8399999999999, That was a nice gift.
648.8399999999999,649.8399999999999," No, it's okay."
649.8399999999999,650.8399999999999, I even Sean's sharing.
650.8399999999999,652.4399999999999, You'll find out when he gets to that this.
652.4399999999999,653.4399999999999," Okay, you hold guys."
653.4399999999999,659.52," And then the other, the other, thank you goes to gaming"
659.52,662.3599999999999," H forms, Code Name, Gowens 007."
662.3599999999999,663.3599999999999, He sent it.
663.3599999999999,664.76, I wasn't here when you opened it.
664.76,665.76," Oh, right."
665.76,669.3199999999999, But he sent like an awesome box of snacks in what our friends
669.32,670.32, and that was the best.
670.32,672.7600000000001, You're knighted kingdom call sweets and we call candy.
672.7600000000001,674.36, And there was some awesome stuff in there.
674.36,675.36, That was good.
675.36,676.36, Did you eat all that?
676.36,677.36, It's almost all gone.
677.36,678.36, Not on my own.
678.36,679.6, Everyone would come in the office and grab stuff.
679.6,682.32," So like, Anthony would, you got quite a bit of that."
682.32,683.72, But that was really good too.
683.72,685.9200000000001, I like to hold the international candy club.
685.9200000000001,688.8000000000001," I mean, I got to reciprocate if there's someone, you know, a foreign"
688.8000000000001,693.2800000000001," listener, foreign to us that is, I mean, if you live some other country, a foreigner,"
693.2800000000001,694.2800000000001, wants a foreigner.
694.2800000000001,695.2800000000001, There's relative.
695.2800000000001,696.2800000000001," Yeah, I think we'll of course."
696.2800000000001,697.5200000000001," If you want some American candy, I'll hook you up."
697.52,700.52," It's like every time I go to another country, like the first thing I do, it's so"
700.52,701.52, sad.
701.52,705.56," So American, but I go to the snack shop and I just like whatever, like, well, you"
705.56,707.1999999999999," see, no, go to the McDonald's first."
707.1999999999999,709.3199999999999," So it's like, I feel like I just got to the airport when there's a black"
709.3199999999999,710.3199999999999, one.
710.3199999999999,715.64," I always, I just hate going to Europe and seeing Americans in the McDonald's."
715.64,716.64, Just piss off.
716.64,719.0, I don't know if you get out of there.
719.0,721.1999999999999, Eat some food from the country you're in.
721.1999999999999,724.4399999999999, That is a good food from America.
724.4399999999999,726.4399999999999, But at least go to our beef.
726.44,730.4000000000001," But just general, you just general, it's fucked up to do that."
730.4000000000001,734.48, McDonald's does a special foods for the countries they're in.
734.48,736.9200000000001, I would probably get beer in a couple of the country.
736.9200000000001,740.36," You can get like lamb beer, a lamb burger when you're in Scotland."
740.36,743.72," And like in Japan, the burgers, you can get them with eggs on top of them."
743.72,746.7600000000001," And Germany, when I was there, I saw like the big ads."
746.7600000000001,750.48," The McDonald's had a bunch of like Indian food, like you can carry burgers and stuff."
750.48,751.48, That's where you can get beer too.
751.48,752.48, And then German McDonald's.
752.48,754.12, But that was such a waste.
754.12,756.4000000000001," You know, when I last went there, and Moses was like,"
756.52,757.56," Oh, God, I'm going to starve."
757.56,760.04, I heard like we're going to be like 30 pounds lighter when going.
760.04,761.0799999999999," I was like, why?"
761.0799999999999,763.16," Like, you think it's just all head cheese and stuff."
763.16,766.48," And then like Robert, you talked her down, which is good before we went."
766.48,767.64," You were like, they have delicious food."
767.64,768.4, And of course they did.
768.4,769.48, It was in Germany.
769.48,770.48," Yeah, Germany."
770.48,771.48," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
771.48,772.48," Oh, yeah."
772.48,775.76," So anyway, here we are."
775.76,776.76, There's our thank you.
776.76,777.76, Thank you.
777.76,779.36, Thank you to everybody who's been sending us nice stuff.
779.36,782.16, And the the nice emails keep pouring in.
782.16,783.16, They did.
783.16,784.16, I don't have any to read here.
784.16,785.16, I forgot.
785.16,787.4399999999999, But if you sent us a nice email.
787.4399999999999,788.16, We thank you.
788.16,789.8, We are reading them and we thank you.
789.8,791.68," Hey, way, I have somebody to thank actually."
791.68,792.28," Yeah, right."
792.28,794.92, I had forgotten to do it on the last piece podcast.
794.92,798.12, But thank you to double vision.
798.12,801.68, Who's the guy who runs one of Team Fortress 2 server.
801.68,805.0799999999999," For going, especially out of his way to help me get a bunch of"
805.0799999999999,807.1999999999999, Medicare chief events.
807.1999999999999,810.8, The guy was exceedingly patient with me.
810.8,811.8," Oh, well."
811.8,813.24," Well, what did he do?"
813.28,815.76, What's it like to have a banana rider?
815.76,817.16, Pretty awesome.
817.16,818.48, I got like 37 minutes.
818.48,819.48, She.
819.48,821.48, Are you done yet?
821.48,822.48, Get them all.
822.48,823.48," No, I have one."
823.48,824.48, Okay.
824.48,825.48, What's the kill in you?
825.48,826.48, And it's like impossible.
826.48,829.84, You have a late at night like fringing that you don't have it still.
829.84,831.12, You wake up at three going.
831.12,832.5600000000001, I think every now and then.
832.5600000000001,834.12," No, I don't do that."
834.12,837.5600000000001," Did you get, but did you get the weapons, the special stuff?"
837.5600000000001,839.12, There's only one weapon I'm missing.
839.12,841.5600000000001, I have to get all the achievements to get the last weapon.
841.56,845.5999999999999, Which is like the one weapon you would want on all the time over saw.
845.5999999999999,846.5999999999999, Yeah.
846.5999999999999,850.4," So you're going to, I mean, when you're done with it, you're still going to play it,"
850.4,851.4, right?
851.4,853.8, Like he spent like so much time getting the achievements.
853.8,854.8, So you can get the fancy weapons.
854.8,856.8, You're going to use those fancy weapons.
856.8,857.8, That's absolutely.
857.8,858.8, That's absolutely.
858.8,859.8," Yeah, yeah."
859.8,860.8, You're not.
860.8,861.8," Yes, I am."
861.8,862.8, I bet I believe that I don't believe them.
862.8,863.8, I believe so.
863.8,865.4799999999999," Well, report report back."
865.4799999999999,866.9599999999999," Yeah, we want to hear."
866.9599999999999,869.0," So this, we can check because of steam."
869.0,871.4399999999999, This week was loaded with with press events.
871.44,873.08," Yeah, which is why we're in the late way."
873.08,877.48," By the way, so if you're upset that we were off by a day, it's because we've been"
877.48,879.0400000000001, hustling back and forth between you.
879.0400000000001,880.2, I'm actually not off by it.
880.2,881.24, I'm going to post this tonight.
881.24,882.24, You are.
882.24,883.72," Oh, that's good."
883.72,884.72, I say it.
884.72,885.72," Man, Sean, I was."
885.72,886.72, Unless I didn't.
886.72,889.72, Then what Jeff said is true.
889.72,893.6800000000001, What I was going to suggest is that we just go through some of the events this
893.6800000000001,897.48, week chronologically because I did it only summer and the night.
897.48,899.2, Sean only went to one.
899.2,900.2, Right.
900.2,901.2, You've been hit.
901.2,905.1600000000001, I went to a couple a few.
905.1600000000001,914.08," So Monday, was a spring showcase, which I have to say first, I thought they had a really"
914.08,915.72, impressive PC line up there.
915.72,921.5200000000001," So surprisingly, many PC exclusive games, big props to EA, they win the PC game."
921.5200000000001,923.12," So far this week, they do win."
923.12,925.08, They had a great line of a PC style.
925.08,928.2, One of them was entirely new IP.
928.2,932.5200000000001," In other words, like it was equal to, I mean, they won't call Battlefield here as a sequel,"
932.5200000000001,936.6, but another installment in the very popular PC series.
936.6,942.8000000000001, New end of month was always daring and then bringing Mass Effect over from Xbox to PC.
942.8000000000001,945.72, It's cool to games from Windows.
945.72,946.72, Right.
946.72,952.2," And making a pretty good case for Mass Effect on the PC too, Sean, Melon, I sat and"
952.2,957.5600000000001," talked to, no, we stood and talked to Ray Musica, who I don't know when that end"
957.5600000000001,958.8000000000001, we was going to go up actually.
958.8000000000001,960.36, Is it going to be after this podcast?
960.36,964.5," I was supposed to email Rob, the guy who filmed it and he said, I think it raised"
964.5,965.5, name and I forgot.
965.5,966.5, So maybe it will never go up now.
966.5,968.24," Well, maybe it'll go up."
968.24,971.6400000000001," Maybe you'll see it on one up or not, but he talked a lot about it."
971.6400000000001,974.12, And he actually had me convinced to try it.
974.12,976.36," And of course, there was the news this week."
976.36,980.4000000000001, There was first the bad news about the copy protection and then the better news that they
980.4,983.48, said never mind after they got there was a shit storm.
983.48,984.48, See that test.
984.48,986.3199999999999, That's for the bioware games that true for sports.
986.3199999999999,990.56," Well, because I know that they had said that the sport was going to use the same thing."
990.56,994.52," I had heard it was true for sport that it was they're going back on it, but I don't"
994.52,995.52, have confidence.
995.52,996.52, It's still really well.
996.52,997.52, Right.
997.52,998.72, Sports still weighs off.
998.72,1002.76, And my my early prediction will be they'll do the same thing as Bioware because
1002.76,1003.76, obviously this is not popular.
1003.76,1009.1999999999999, It was a pretty fast free of hand to reacted what in 24 hours 48 hours.
1009.2,1010.8000000000001, How did the proposed system work?
1010.8000000000001,1015.5200000000001, Did you actually have to put in that like 20 digit code on a weekly basis?
1015.5200000000001,1017.24, I think it was 10 days.
1017.24,1018.4000000000001, I think it was like every 10 days.
1018.4000000000001,1021.96, I had to verify that you had still had the CD like you had to play with it.
1021.96,1022.96, I think it was a lot of me.
1022.96,1023.96, I like that.
1023.96,1024.96, That's pretty reasonable to me.
1024.96,1026.1200000000001, That didn't freak me out either.
1026.1200000000001,1029.96," Yeah, but people people always forget about anything that has to do with that secure"
1029.96,1030.96, arm.
1030.96,1031.96, Right.
1031.96,1033.28, This was a better solution anyway.
1033.28,1034.28, What they came up with.
1034.28,1035.28, What is this?
1035.28,1038.48, It's a one time online validation.
1038.48,1039.48, And then you're done.
1039.48,1040.48, Yeah.
1040.48,1041.48, Right.
1041.48,1042.48, Which is more standard.
1042.48,1043.48, Yeah.
1043.48,1044.48, Yeah.
1044.48,1046.48, I wasn't necessarily going.
1046.48,1047.48, Oh my god.
1047.48,1048.48, It's the end of the world.
1048.48,1049.48, Yeah.
1049.48,1051.84," You know, I think I'm a little more with link to accept copy protection schemes than some"
1051.84,1052.84, people.
1052.84,1053.84, Right.
1053.84,1054.84, Yeah.
1054.84,1055.84, So yeah.
1055.84,1059.84, So let's talk about some of the other games we saw.
1059.84,1060.84, Did you?
1060.84,1061.84, This is a.
1061.84,1064.84, What am I going to say?
1064.84,1068.44, Let's hit the let's just like hit some non-peasy stuff that was there to
1068.44,1069.44, fucking all up.
1069.44,1070.8, I actually know what my justification is.
1070.8,1071.8, I was talking about.
1071.8,1072.8, I was going to get it.
1072.8,1075.04, It's skated for an attendal we.
1075.04,1078.4," So it was like, I'm thinking about like this first segment of the show and making sure"
1078.4,1080.04, everyone in here's got something to say.
1080.04,1082.0, It's like Robert didn't go to the event.
1082.0,1084.68," So, but you do, but you are a fan of skate."
1084.68,1090.0, So they showed the Nintendo DS and we versions of the game and versions.
1090.0,1091.3200000000002," I mean, like sequels or whatever."
1091.3200000000002,1093.44, And it's called skate.
1093.44,1098.1200000000001," The thing that looked interesting to me, the S version not so much, but the we thing."
1098.6399999999999,1102.08," It looked cool enough where they had you doing the tricks by like, you know, moving the"
1102.08,1106.04," we-mote in different ways, but then the bounce board was kind of interesting."
1106.04,1110.08," And even though, you know, they're anticipating the concerns of saying, this isn't actually"
1110.08,1112.8799999999999, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head.
1112.8799999999999,1117.28," This being standing on the board, leaning left and right to turn back and forward to, you"
1117.28,1119.04," know, to go up on your tail or your nose."
1119.04,1123.04," But then using the we-mote and, you know, spinning it in your hand and twisting it and"
1123.04,1125.4399999999998, jerking it at the same time to do the tricks.
1125.44,1130.3200000000002," You know, we're disconnect between feet and hands, but when I watched that, I was like,"
1130.3200000000002,1132.44, I want to like a wakeboarding game again.
1132.44,1133.44, And this would be perfect.
1133.44,1135.44," You just hold the, the we-mote like a leash."
1135.44,1141.44, And I say this because the EA's wakeboarding game that they put out in the tail end of
1141.44,1146.1200000000001," like, well, it was like the middle of the Xbox and PS2's life cycle was like so awesome."
1146.1200000000001,1148.72, That was like the last game you to imagine me liking.
1148.72,1150.1200000000001, And I played it and I got really into it.
1150.1200000000001,1151.1200000000001, So I wanted to see that.
1151.1200000000001,1152.44, Wasn't that an activation game then?
1152.44,1153.44," Oh, it was."
1153.44,1154.44, My bad.
1154.44,1155.28, It was active vision.
1155.28,1156.28," Yeah, this thing."
1156.28,1157.28, We got that wrong.
1157.28,1165.08," The thing with the we-mote and the, and the bounce board was almost seemed like harder than actually"
1165.08,1166.08, just skating.
1166.08,1167.08, Right.
1167.08,1168.08, Watching him do that.
1168.08,1169.08, Yeah.
1169.08,1171.68," I mean, they admitted that they had like just started implementing this."
1171.68,1172.68, Yeah.
1172.68,1173.68, It was super early.
1173.68,1176.92, They only had the bounce board for what a couple weeks or a few weeks.
1176.92,1177.92, Yeah.
1177.92,1181.92," But if they could work it out where you're able to just use nothing but the bounce board,"
1181.92,1182.92, that'd be great.
1182.92,1184.92, The problem is those games have so many tricks.
1184.92,1185.92, Yeah.
1185.92,1186.92, Finding a way to bullshit it.
1186.92,1189.0," Like, you know, remember the old arcade game top skater was fun."
1189.0,1191.48, You actually stood on the board and had two rails.
1191.48,1194.76, And the way that they did it is they basically just bullshit it to the trick system when
1194.76,1195.76, you're in the air.
1195.76,1196.76," But I mean, that would be fun."
1196.76,1197.76, Even if they had just that.
1197.76,1198.76, Yeah.
1198.76,1199.76, We have.
1199.76,1201.8400000000001, It will skate already has sort of a simplified system.
1201.8400000000001,1204.2, Like it's not as crazy as Tony Hawk.
1204.2,1205.2, He can do a lot of tricks.
1205.2,1208.64, But a lot of them are sort of technicalities.
1208.64,1211.64," It's like, oh, you did a kick flip backwards."
1211.64,1212.64," You know, right."
1212.64,1215.4, It's a pretty easy simplified sort of like real skateboarding.
1215.4,1216.76, Turning in the daily thing.
1216.76,1220.5600000000002," Like turning jazz hands into a skateboard trick, which is like, it's got to have"
1220.5600000000002,1222.2, a fan to skateboard or two somewhere.
1222.2,1223.2, Yeah.
1223.2,1224.76, You got to feel like you're feel cool.
1224.76,1225.76, I don't think.
1225.76,1226.76, Yeah.
1226.76,1227.76, Sorry.
1227.76,1228.76, I just spasped out.
1228.76,1229.76, Not so good.
1229.76,1232.2, I always wished that my hands and Robert's face like I was doing tricks.
1232.2,1233.96, You did do tricks.
1233.96,1237.76, That I always wished for these like new sort of alternative control schemes.
1237.76,1243.8799999999999," Like I hope that like eventually they'll have a little more you know, depth and precision."
1243.8799999999999,1247.72," You know, playing the Wii is cool, but I always wonder like five or 10 years is there going"
1247.72,1251.96, to be some way that really let's see do a lot of different things with motion and control.
1251.96,1252.96," Well, I'll talk."
1252.96,1254.24, I'll talk out of turn.
1254.24,1257.68," But because it's not related to this event, but this week I've been playing Lost"
1257.68,1263.08," Wins, which is one of the Wii where launch games and my review will be a soon as I"
1263.08,1264.4, actually write it.
1264.4,1265.72, But.
1266.3600000000001,1272.16," But it's a really good, really good implementation of the Wii remote, like one of the"
1272.16,1273.88, best I've seen yet.
1273.88,1279.68, And it's not doing anything revolutionary yet except it's just doing it's using it very judiciously
1279.68,1285.6000000000001," and smartly in a way that's not like too cute or too gimmicky, but it's a matter of like"
1285.6000000000001,1291.76, manipulating the wind by waving the thing and then variations on Lost wind is in your
1291.76,1293.08, basically fanning fart.
1293.08,1294.08, Yeah.
1294.08,1296.32, It's the joke waiting to be told.
1296.32,1297.32, Yes.
1297.32,1298.32, That's cool.
1298.32,1299.32, Now it has been so okay.
1299.32,1300.32, And now it has been.
1300.32,1301.32, Yeah.
1301.32,1303.32, What's that Lost Widd?
1303.32,1305.0," Yeah, I heard good things about that."
1305.0,1306.0, I'd like to.
1306.0,1307.0, Yeah.
1307.0,1310.6799999999998," But yeah, it's not an alternative thing like you're talking about, but it's a really"
1310.6799999999998,1311.6799999999998, good use of it.
1311.6799999999998,1312.6799999999998, Yeah.
1312.6799999999998,1313.6799999999998, Anyway.
1313.6799999999998,1314.6799999999998, And like that.
1314.6799999999998,1315.6799999999998, Sorry.
1315.6799999999998,1316.6799999999998, We're going to move on.
1316.6799999999998,1318.6799999999998, So I was going to hit up another game of the lineup.
1318.6799999999998,1320.6799999999998, I'll talk about Battle forge.
1320.6799999999998,1321.6799999999998, Let's do.
1321.6799999999998,1322.6799999999998, Did we all see that?
1322.6799999999998,1323.6799999999998, I don't know what it is.
1323.76,1324.68, I don't know what that is.
1324.68,1325.68, What is that?
1325.68,1327.76, Battle forge is a break it down.
1327.76,1329.3600000000001," Sean Moly, could you break them?"
1329.3600000000001,1330.3600000000001, Sure.
1330.3600000000001,1331.3600000000001, I could do that.
1331.3600000000001,1336.64, It's an RTS real time strategy game where you kind of have a magic the gathering style
1336.64,1340.1200000000001, deck that you draw from to bring units on to the field.
1340.1200000000001,1343.4, And they actually want you to see the thing.
1343.4,1344.4, It's online only.
1344.4,1345.64, It's online only.
1345.64,1350.44," And you actually, it comes with like a free made deck or slightly randomized deck quote"
1350.44,1352.16, I'm quote in the game itself.
1352.16,1353.4, And then you have to buy two packs.
1353.4,1359.3600000000001," So like just like magic the gathering, your potential army depends on the virtual"
1359.3600000000001,1360.3600000000001, card you have.
1360.3600000000001,1362.52," Yeah, they kind of glossed over that during the demo part."
1362.52,1363.76," For the, we had to extract that."
1363.76,1364.76, So later.
1364.76,1365.76, Yeah.
1365.76,1366.76, When you're playing the way it looks.
1366.76,1370.0, As if you imagine your spell bar on the bottom of any like MMO that you're used to or even
1370.0,1372.76, an RTS your commander powers or things like that.
1372.76,1376.4," And instead of a power each, there's an icon that represents one of the cards."
1376.4,1380.4, And then you basically drag it from that bar and throw it onto the field.
1380.4,1384.6000000000001," And then if it's a card for say like a giant warrior, he'll then materialize from the"
1384.6000000000001,1385.6000000000001, card.
1385.6000000000001,1386.6000000000001, Maybe it's a spell.
1386.6000000000001,1388.6000000000001, You throw the actual card in the area that you want.
1388.6000000000001,1389.6000000000001, That thunder stormed it.
1389.6000000000001,1390.6000000000001, And you need to and they will.
1390.6000000000001,1391.6000000000001, Right.
1391.6000000000001,1396.2, And you need to capture a control point similar to a company of heroes to sort of expand
1396.2,1400.64, your territory and and those territories power up the cards.
1400.64,1401.64, Right.
1401.64,1403.64," And those control points also give you the resource, which is the."
1403.64,1404.64, That's what I'm saying.
1404.64,1405.64, Yeah.
1405.64,1409.3600000000001, And the other twist is that it's the 12th player cooperative campaign.
1409.3600000000001,1410.3600000000001, It's all co-op.
1410.36,1411.36, Yeah.
1411.36,1412.36," Well, they're actually as PvP, right?"
1412.36,1413.36, Yeah.
1413.36,1414.36, There is.
1414.36,1418.24, But the main their main emphasis is that you'll be playing with others against the
1418.24,1423.36, AI in a campaign long series of battles.
1423.36,1424.36, Yeah.
1424.36,1426.36, So the section they demonstrated looked cool.
1426.36,1428.36, They only had two people playing.
1428.36,1432.6," But it was nice to see, you know, one one the players would take a route that was high"
1432.6,1437.4399999999998, ground and another player might route through a valley and they'd meet up and then the player
1437.44,1442.0," in the high ground would use his arrows and you know, long range attacks to to set up an ambush"
1442.0,1445.68, and then the other players infantry within March through the plane and fight the enemy in
1445.68,1446.68, there.
1446.68,1448.0, That kind of stuff seemed pretty cool to me.
1448.0,1449.0, It's hard.
1449.0,1450.68, It's always hard to see like some art.
1450.68,1453.04," Yes, as we just see a bunch of units doing stuff."
1453.04,1456.4, You don't really get a sense of how any of the checking out is it just this units more
1456.4,1457.4, powerful.
1457.4,1459.4, It's going to win or can you.
1459.4,1463.04," I mean, the fear of microing that you know, when they're doing the demonstration, they're"
1463.04,1464.72," like, there's no micro management or anything."
1464.72,1466.6000000000001," But for me, it's like that's where the fun is."
1466.6000000000001,1472.24, It means that you're not just throwing like a blob of units at another and then knowing
1472.24,1474.2," that like, well, I have better stats on going away now."
1474.2,1476.44, I just basically watch some stuff happen.
1476.44,1477.44," You know, right."
1477.44,1480.3600000000001," When you look at the cards, they do have little descriptions like this guy is good"
1480.3600000000001,1482.08, at tearing down walls or something like that.
1482.08,1483.08, So there seems to be some.
1483.08,1484.08, Right.
1484.08,1487.8, There seems to be some element of which cards do I play at what time to to counter the other
1487.8,1490.2, units or to counter the environment or whatever.
1490.2,1491.2, Why me cards?
1491.2,1492.2, You know what I mean?
1492.2,1494.68," I mean, I know card games are cooler."
1494.68,1495.68, Whatever.
1495.68,1499.44, But what's the difference between cards and just saying it's an RTS where you just buy units?
1499.44,1500.44, Right.
1500.44,1504.3200000000002, Guess is it just the probably just to get people used to the idea that they're going
1504.3200000000002,1505.3200000000002, to be purchasing something.
1505.3200000000002,1506.3200000000002, Yeah.
1506.3200000000002,1507.96," Collecting cards is like, yeah."
1507.96,1513.44," I mean, to me, like, collecting fake virtual cards without an actual card is a leap."
1513.44,1514.44, I'm not ready to take.
1514.44,1515.44, Yeah.
1515.44,1518.0, Even though I don't necessarily want a bunch of paper cards cluttering up that don't really
1518.0,1519.0, do anything.
1519.0,1520.72," It depends how much they charge for them, though."
1520.72,1525.28, They might have just like I was telling Sean that if they made like a virtual warhammer
1525.28,1529.6000000000001," where I could buy fake models, but they were like one third the price and I could play"
1529.6000000000001,1530.6000000000001, online.
1530.6000000000001,1531.6000000000001, I would totally do it.
1531.6000000000001,1532.6000000000001, Yeah.
1532.6000000000001,1533.6000000000001, I never sell them models.
1533.6000000000001,1534.6000000000001, Yeah.
1534.6000000000001,1537.72," Those cards, you know, I don't know how the how companies like this deal with like the magic"
1537.72,1540.72, the gathering license because this thing looks exactly like a magic card.
1540.72,1543.2, So I didn't I guess magic doesn't rule the work of the game.
1543.2,1545.48, I guess you have to know if it has a copyright on that thing.
1545.48,1549.72," But to me, like as someone who who played magical on time ago, like this will"
1549.72,1555.48, look like the best implementation of like a magic style card playing game on the piece.
1555.48,1558.3600000000001, He like way better than the magic the gathering games themselves.
1558.3600000000001,1559.84, I guess it's supposed to kind of.
1559.84,1562.48," So if you like that kind of game, the cards were cool."
1562.48,1567.64," I thought I just can say I guess and that and you know, it's like beats like sitting at"
1567.64,1570.3600000000001," a gathering and like being like, and I play my red or."
1570.3600000000001,1571.3600000000001, Right.
1571.3600000000001,1572.3600000000001," Well, that's it."
1572.3600000000001,1573.3600000000001, There's no red orc to actually see do combat.
1573.3600000000001,1574.3600000000001, Yeah.
1574.3600000000001,1575.3600000000001, I actually can also it orc.
1575.3600000000001,1576.3600000000001, Yeah.
1576.3600000000001,1578.3600000000001," You see him in your head, though."
1578.4399999999998,1579.36," Well, that's my fight."
1579.36,1581.1999999999998, And that's a nation's no fun.
1581.1999999999998,1586.84, It's also the first like PC card game where they're doing something that only a PC
1586.84,1590.8," could do and you couldn't really do with cards at a table, let him to bet like that."
1590.8,1591.8, Right.
1591.8,1592.8," I mean, like I have judgment."
1592.8,1593.8, They tried.
1593.8,1598.08," No, but that you could totally play that game without the graphical."
1598.08,1599.08," Oh, yeah."
1599.08,1600.08, And the camera.
1600.08,1603.0, It's really just a card game that happens to like have fireworks go.
1603.0,1604.0, Right.
1604.0,1605.8799999999999, That was totally a card game implementation.
1606.8400000000001,1609.3200000000002," And RTS, which is something that, you know,"
1609.3200000000002,1611.2800000000002," everything that doesn't have, which is something that still"
1611.2800000000002,1614.5200000000002, might be a doesn't have a game designed around a business model.
1614.5200000000002,1614.88, It is.
1614.88,1615.24, All right.
1615.24,1617.6000000000001, Instead of a game designed around a game.
1617.6000000000001,1618.1200000000001, I don't.
1618.1200000000001,1618.64, Yeah.
1618.64,1619.68, That makes me skeptical.
1619.68,1620.64, I don't think they're.
1620.64,1622.68, I don't think they can coexist.
1622.68,1625.6000000000001, I don't think that they can be mutually exclusive for what I try to say.
1625.6000000000001,1626.68, Like in the could work.
1626.68,1627.2, It could.
1627.2,1629.96," I mean, in the demo, they gave us in front of the whole crowd."
1629.96,1632.4," And then in the demo, we got on our own."
1632.64,1636.6000000000001," It looked good, you know, without them even getting to that part of it."
1636.6000000000001,1638.88," You know, yeah, Sean extracted that point out."
1638.88,1642.24," And then it was sort of like a, oh, but the game still look good,"
1642.24,1643.8000000000002, even just for what it is.
1643.8000000000002,1644.8000000000002, And I don't know.
1644.8000000000002,1646.4, I was really like that.
1646.4,1646.8000000000002, Right.
1646.8000000000002,1649.24, I was just saying it still looked like you unlocked cards through playing
1649.24,1649.92, to it isn't like you.
1649.92,1650.44, All right.
1650.44,1650.92, The cards.
1650.92,1651.2800000000002, Yeah.
1651.2800000000002,1651.88, That's right.
1651.88,1652.2800000000002, There's that.
1652.2800000000002,1655.3600000000001, I could definitely see a game that that incorporated like
1655.3600000000001,1658.92," rarity, you know, instead of like making you buy a card to get"
1658.92,1661.44," superior force, you're just playing it."
1661.44,1665.1200000000001, You somehow find that you've got the most badass card by accident.
1665.1200000000001,1666.56," I mean, Guild Wars was in a lot of ways."
1666.56,1669.48," And Emma with a card system, but they didn't call them cards."
1669.48,1670.44, They call them skills.
1670.44,1672.3600000000001," I mean, you collected them in much the same way."
1672.3600000000001,1673.2, You would cards.
1673.2,1673.56, Yeah.
1673.56,1674.44, And that worked cool.
1674.44,1678.2," But this, this you actually do buy a booster pack quote unquote virtual"
1678.2,1681.2, booster pack 15 cards that are randomly selected.
1681.2,1681.56, Yeah.
1681.56,1682.92," Oh, God, they're randomized."
1682.92,1684.2," I thought, well, yeah, sure."
1684.2,1684.4, Yeah.
1684.4,1685.2, I thought it.
1685.2,1686.56, I thought it was you got the pick.
1686.56,1687.4, So I don't know.
1687.4,1688.0800000000002, I was quite there.
1688.0800000000002,1689.3200000000002, Maybe there are some you can pick.
1689.3200000000002,1689.52, I don't.
1689.52,1691.4," I'm not entirely sure what the actual, but the guy."
1691.4,1694.44, I did say that there is going to be a booster pack sort of system.
1694.44,1696.8400000000001, There might be also a card system.
1696.8400000000001,1698.24," But yeah, maybe they're more expensive."
1698.24,1700.0400000000002, There is something maybe you buy for a dollar.
1700.0400000000002,1702.24, You can get 15 random cards or for $2.
1702.24,1703.24, You can get.
1703.24,1705.64, But I'm sure that there will be lots of parents willing to do that.
1705.64,1710.0, Just to keep those cards like off the floor out of everything.
1710.0,1713.3200000000002," Like you ever know, like the little kiddos and magic cards."
1713.3200000000002,1714.88, And they're like all over the fucking house.
1714.88,1716.1200000000001," Little kid, nothing, dude."
1716.1200000000001,1718.3200000000002, The dude I lived with last year in college.
1718.3200000000002,1721.3200000000002," Yeah, we had to go out and forcefully get him."
1721.32,1723.1599999999999, So he could just wait for those white boxes with the drawers.
1723.1599999999999,1726.08, So he could like put him because they just be everywhere.
1726.08,1730.6799999999998, And the challenge for them is going to be the challenge for the design is going to be
1730.6799999999998,1737.08, like how to make it playable and make you feel powerful enough to play online without
1737.08,1738.24, having to buy anything.
1738.24,1742.6, Like you should be whatever you get out of the box should be totally viable.
1742.6,1745.96," And then you know, finding the balance between walls if it's totally viable."
1745.96,1747.36, Why are people going to find each other?
1747.3999999999999,1752.84," Yeah, too, that the emphasis of what they're pushing here is co-op."
1752.84,1757.32," So it's not really about how you have to, you know, you're going to have to play against"
1757.32,1759.12, somebody who's been moving to punty.
1759.12,1760.12, It's more like money.
1760.12,1761.32," Yeah, I'll blow RTS or something."
1761.32,1762.32, Yeah.
1762.32,1763.6," Yeah, and I've been, we've been talking about this before."
1763.6,1767.6399999999999, We were just waiting for that bet co-op RTS to come along where the campaign is right.
1767.6399999999999,1771.12," And they're also talking about how, you know, the cards are coller coded in the same way"
1771.12,1774.1599999999999, like magic is of whatever the red ones are fire.
1774.16,1779.92," So like Sean could go in with his whatever, you know, his cold ice deck and I would"
1779.92,1781.4, go in with a water deck.
1781.4,1784.24," See, and I'd be the fire guy."
1784.24,1789.0," And so there'll be ways of where you, you may be valuable to a team to take down a certain"
1789.0,1792.8000000000002," boss or whatever based on your deck, even if it isn't like some Uber deck."
1792.8000000000002,1796.92," When we first read the description, I was like, this was before we saw the game."
1796.92,1799.92," We were considering it for, you know, print preview."
1799.92,1803.6000000000001," To me, it seemed like, like Robert was saying it problematic and it's a game based on"
1803.6000000000001,1808.04," a business model, but also like, I just couldn't get past why the cards."
1808.04,1810.0800000000002," But what's up with this, there's two different games."
1810.0800000000002,1813.5600000000002, There's card games and then there's games like this and why try to shoot one the other
1813.5600000000002,1814.5600000000002, one in.
1814.5600000000002,1817.68," But when I did see it, I mean, I was like, okay, I can understand how this is working."
1817.68,1821.0," And since they just used the cards, I was like, these visual methods were something"
1821.0,1822.0, stuff.
1822.0,1823.0, You know what I mean?
1823.0,1824.6000000000001, That seemed cool enough.
1824.6000000000001,1826.8400000000001," Well, and maybe I didn't see it."
1826.8400000000001,1828.04," I don't know, is it like random?"
1828.04,1829.68, Like you could only have five cards at once.
1829.68,1832.88," So then you're like, oh, I just got this card that was in my dick awesome or something."
1832.88,1833.88, I'm not sure.
1833.88,1837.04," It looks like the judging by the demo, which maybe this is just something that's"
1837.04,1838.04, hit up for the demo.
1838.04,1841.4, Look like the cards that you had out were persistent and maybe a drum from the deck at the
1841.4,1842.72, beginning or maybe built it.
1842.72,1844.8, But then they all had cool downs after you used them.
1844.8,1848.76," So like you would summon red dragon, which was one of eight cards at the bottom."
1848.76,1852.0, But then it would kind of go dark and then slowly fade back in the light.
1852.0,1854.88," So it looked like, I don't know if there's, there might be a way to, you know, it was going"
1854.88,1855.88, to save that one.
1855.88,1856.88, Make sense of the head cards.
1856.88,1861.5200000000002," It was like, you randomly get like you try and like in magic, you try and like fat in"
1861.5200000000002,1863.92, your deck with certain cards you want and then you just get it.
1863.92,1864.92," Yeah, right."
1864.92,1865.92, Right.
1865.92,1866.92, Or something.
1866.92,1868.92, I know if there's like a shrine you walk into and then you can shuffle your deck or something.
1868.92,1870.92, It was cool.
1870.92,1871.92, I know.
1871.92,1875.4, I just was happy to see a game like that at an event like that too.
1875.4,1876.4," Yeah, totally."
1876.4,1880.2," Well, RTS Coup isn't like Donnawort to."
1880.2,1881.96," I heard that was RTS Coup, isn't it?"
1881.96,1883.2, It sounds like it will.
1883.2,1884.2," Well, no more about that."
1884.2,1888.68," I actually, a precedent for that this Friday and there's going to be a bar go on it, but"
1888.68,1891.68," so we'll be able to talk about that sometime next week, I believe."
1891.68,1892.68, Sweet.
1892.68,1897.0800000000002," Along the same lines with, you know, using a business model and marrying into the game"
1897.0800000000002,1899.92," design, this battlefield of heroes that they had there."
1899.92,1902.04, And that was interesting.
1902.04,1903.04, It was fun to play.
1903.04,1905.1200000000001," I mean, it, it looks great."
1905.1200000000001,1909.04, And it was interesting for me because I had done a cover story and I was just looking
1909.04,1912.3600000000001," at video and talking to everyone, making it and going through slides and stuff and I got"
1912.36,1916.9199999999998," to actually play and see how that, you know, the experience of playing and compared to their"
1916.9199999999998,1919.04, description of what it's like to play it.
1919.04,1924.04," But the thing that immediately was was kind of troubling to me is that again, you had"
1924.04,1928.08," to spell bar, this task bar in the bottom, and it was loaded up with, because we had these"
1928.08,1930.8799999999999," pre-leveled characters and it had, you know, all these powers."
1930.8799999999999,1932.8799999999999, I had sticky bombs.
1932.8799999999999,1935.08," This basically, it's like a force push."
1935.08,1937.7199999999998," It's like if you have a bunch of enemies around you, you hit it and throw some"
1937.72,1941.04," aside or if they're in a tank, it'll knock the tank over and kick them out of it."
1941.04,1943.88, So then you can then run and jump in the tank.
1943.88,1944.88, And that was an awesome power.
1944.88,1949.24," It's like, it's, it's a, it's perfect solution to how do you have vehicles and how, and"
1949.24,1951.08, every game is tried to find some other one.
1951.08,1954.28," Hey, low, of course, you could jack someone from the vehicle, jump on and throw grenade in."
1954.28,1959.6000000000001," And this, like, you can have vehicles that are powerful against infantry that's less powerful,"
1959.6000000000001,1962.24," but then still have the, the balance workout."
1962.24,1965.24," But then so it's like I looked at all these, these powers and weapons ahead."
1965.24,1966.24, And so this isn't right.
1966.24,1968.48, I'm just going to log out and make a new character from scratch.
1968.48,1972.2," And then when I did that, these started with just two weapons and no powers."
1972.2,1976.68," And, you know, basically, just like a, a shotgun and then I could choose either a rocket or"
1976.68,1980.04, a sticky bomb to fight the vehicles with.
1980.04,1981.04, And I don't know.
1981.04,1985.08," I don't have much of a sense for how quickly you acquire these abilities, but the difference"
1985.08,1990.8, between the level one character and the characters they had was like an order I described
1990.8,1991.8, in the previous one.
1991.8,1997.48," It was an order magnitude greater than like any, like, balance, you know, balances in"
1997.48,2002.84, call duty parks called duty force per system between a new player and a level 55.
2002.84,2009.1599999999999," So you have this situation where you take opposition that's like battlehard and, you know,"
2009.1599999999999,2010.8, they're experiencing playing longer.
2010.8,2014.76," And then on top of that, they've also got access to the best powers and weapons."
2014.76,2017.04, And you put them against the new people.
2017.04,2020.84, And then you ship it as a casual game.
2020.9199999999998,2021.84," I don't, I mean, I don't know."
2021.84,2025.12, I don't want to just seem like such a serious thing because part of it is working toward
2025.12,2028.28," that part of it's to give you that loss of like, hey, how do I get that?"
2028.28,2029.56, And then you play your way toward it.
2029.56,2034.4399999999998," But my experience is that anytime you have a competitive game, a game that like a shooter"
2034.4399999999998,2039.52," of any sort that allows you to compete with someone, casual, whatever you have on your,"
2039.52,2042.12, on your drawing board just kind of disappears right away.
2042.12,2043.12, And it was proven there.
2043.12,2047.12," We were playing, there was like four stations, workstations for the press and then everyone"
2047.12,2049.84, else was in their Redwood City beta testing thing.
2049.84,2054.1200000000003," And those guys, they have this thing where they like want you to know that they can kick"
2054.1200000000003,2055.1200000000003, your ass.
2055.1200000000003,2058.7200000000003," And they want you to know that even though they've been playing it for 50 hours a week,"
2058.7200000000003,2061.6400000000003, they're about as good as you'd expect if you played the game for 50 hours a week against
2061.6400000000003,2066.76," someone who just just sat down when there's like crazy, like, techno playing in the background"
2066.76,2071.76, and beard farmers brushing against you and almost spilling their drinks down your back.
2071.76,2072.76, And they let you know.
2072.76,2073.76," But so it was like, they were proof."
2073.76,2076.6000000000004," It was like, yeah, that for my point, that's a good strategy."
2076.6000000000004,2077.76," That's a good thing, though."
2077.76,2079.4," They got to be like, let the press win."
2079.4,2080.4, Yeah.
2080.4,2081.4, So it's so weird.
2081.4,2084.12," Now, and then it's like, you'll play in a press review session to get the sense that"
2084.12,2085.12, that's happening.
2085.12,2087.96, But I've noticed it several times playing games.
2087.96,2094.32," Like I've went for that Unreal tournament story of, for GFW and I remember playing against"
2094.32,2095.96, the people making it.
2095.96,2099.04," And I'm not a, we were just standing still with the knife."
2099.04,2100.44," No, but I was just running around."
2100.44,2102.56, I would be like running around going after people.
2102.56,2105.52," I'd notice people just, you know, like, I'm doing this."
2105.52,2106.52," Oh, you got me again."
2106.52,2107.52, You're great.
2107.52,2108.52, Yeah.
2108.52,2109.52, Isn't this game great?
2109.52,2110.52, Did they ever go?
2110.52,2112.16, Did they ever stop and go?
2112.16,2113.52," Robert, that was a wonderful headshot."
2113.52,2114.52, Yeah.
2114.52,2116.52, You're a great at this game.
2116.52,2120.28," It was really like, you're like, wow, I can't believe you managed to kill that guy with"
2120.28,2123.6, the machine gun by shooting him in the feet so many times.
2123.6,2124.6, Yeah.
2124.6,2125.6, Yeah.
2125.6,2129.6," Other times, though, you'll have, like, the beta guys that just will not give an"
2129.6,2132.92," inch in there there to make your, your time hell."
2132.92,2136.52," But it was interesting because it did prove that whatever the trappings are, you know,"
2136.52,2140.64," much like Team Fortress 2, if you're a, you know, serious, you've considered yourself a"
2140.64,2146.32," serious shooter player and you want to be rewarded for, you know, your skillset, like the"
2146.32,2147.7599999999998, game will absolutely do that.
2147.7599999999998,2151.28," You know, there's a lot of cool stuff that you can do in it too with the powers."
2151.28,2154.88," I mean, you can, and to differentiate it from regular battlefield games."
2154.88,2158.68," I mean, you can rock it jump, of course, you know, jump up over buildings and things and"
2158.68,2163.16," throw your sticky bombs, which tier sticky bomb and mid air and throw that on someone else."
2163.16,2167.3199999999997," Other weird powers are like, uh, sniper can mark you so that everyone on this team,"
2167.3199999999997,2171.3199999999997," not on what sees you indicated, uh, like with an outline of some sort, but they can see you"
2171.3199999999997,2172.3199999999997, through walls.
2172.3199999999997,2176.48," And then when that powers, like acting on you, you have an arrow above your head so that"
2176.48,2180.08," you know that you are basically, you can't hide from anyone."
2180.08,2181.08, What does it mean?
2181.08,2185.52," I mean, it only works for one person, like someone can decide that they just want to"
2185.52,2191.92, see you behind wall and it will enable their entire team as well as themselves to see you.
2191.92,2195.48," Just for a time, just for a small period of time."
2195.48,2196.48, That's weird.
2196.48,2197.48, You would think it would be the opposite.
2197.48,2200.48, You would have the power and then suddenly be able to see everyone from the opposing
2200.48,2201.48, team through walls.
2201.48,2204.48," But instead, you pick one person that everyone on your team."
2204.48,2206.0," There's something like that in, wow, too."
2206.0,2207.0, Okay.
2207.0,2208.0, Like everybody on the side of the room.
2208.0,2209.0," Just thinking, Hunter's marketing."
2209.0,2213.32," Like immediately, is it like, and there's, there's even a quibble in a fortress forever."
2213.32,2219.52," Like, team, basically, it's a team fortress classic remake for source, the sniper and"
2219.52,2223.44, that can tag you with like a tracking bullet and then a radar will come up and then you
2223.44,2227.72, could see that person for like a small amount of time when they're traveling out.
2227.72,2232.04," But the other thing is the planes, that was their fun to use and it was like immediately"
2232.04,2234.8," if you played battlefield, even though it's third person point of view, you're like, okay,"
2234.8,2238.12," I'm used to this, like this handles the way I would expect."
2238.12,2242.4, But they had like this like dedicated flyboy on their team who was just like hogging
2242.4,2243.4, to plane the entire time.
2243.4,2247.44," But that just reminded me, that was, that's always been an issue in battlefield games."
2247.44,2252.36, And you have like some super powerful vehicle that you can like get points with everyone's
2252.36,2253.36, going to want to use it.
2253.36,2257.28," And so to avoid that with tanks and jeeps, what they make it is that if you go to the place,"
2257.28,2258.4, it just will spawn there.
2258.4,2259.4, They're always B-1-4.
2259.4,2263.32," But you can't do a plane's because then you're going to have like everyone's going to be flying,"
2263.32,2264.32, right?
2264.32,2266.4, And so there's only one in that means you got away.
2266.4,2268.28, But then the downside is that everyone else wants it.
2268.28,2269.52, So they just wait on the runway.
2269.52,2272.2400000000002," Meanwhile, their team's losing, but they don't give a shit because they just want to get"
2272.2400000000002,2273.2400000000002, the plane.
2273.2400000000002,2274.2400000000002, And they're so nice.
2274.2400000000002,2277.4," So I clearly, they haven't solved that issue yet."
2278.2000000000003,2282.04," Can you team kill like the people in the, they need to be able to fly like he used to be able to."
2282.04,2283.2000000000003, They knew better on that.
2283.2000000000003,2285.6800000000003," Oh, which by ramming into teammates, I didn't try that."
2285.6800000000003,2286.44, It was impressive.
2287.44,2289.6800000000003, But they knew they had to get off the universe.
2289.6800000000003,2291.64, The other thing is the character creation stuff.
2291.64,2292.92, Did anyone else get to mess with it?
2292.92,2297.36," No, I was standing behind some deweeb with fingerless gloves on for 20 minutes."
2297.36,2298.2000000000003, It's never got that.
2298.2000000000003,2300.36," Yeah, it was a way to body his sex was there."
2300.36,2302.36," Yeah, he really has fingerless gloves."
2302.36,2304.28," Yeah, so fucking rad."
2304.28,2305.08," Oh, man."
2305.72,2307.36, Everything there works has advertised.
2307.36,2309.72," I mean, you, the game loads as fast as they say."
2309.72,2311.3199999999997, You go to a website and you hit play now.
2311.3199999999997,2313.48," And it's like boom, you're next thing, you know, you're playing the game."
2313.48,2315.88, But the character customization things really streamlined.
2315.88,2316.96, So it's like paper doll.
2316.96,2318.2, You got one on the left.
2318.2,2319.44," And Jeff, you're doing this."
2319.44,2322.6," This weird look, you're still worrying that the fingerless glove guys are going to be."
2322.6,2323.6," No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
2323.6,2324.4," You know, head."
2325.6,2326.4, It's a money sex.
2326.4,2327.08," I'm not, sorry."
2327.08,2328.56," I'm, I'm listening to you."
2328.56,2329.56, Go on.
2329.56,2331.7599999999998, That was uncomfortable because you don't want to money sex.
2331.7599999999998,2333.44, I know the money is sex.
2333.44,2334.2799999999997, Personally.
2334.36,2335.28, Yeah.
2335.28,2336.2000000000003, He and I go back.
2336.2000000000003,2337.0400000000004, Yeah.
2337.0400000000004,2338.84, He was at the event.
2338.84,2339.84, Mm-hmm.
2339.84,2341.0400000000004, We got derailed.
2341.0400000000004,2343.6400000000003, The character customization menus really cool.
2343.6400000000003,2346.48, It's like there's just like a paper doll looking finger to your character.
2346.48,2351.44," And then they're all these tabs to switch to, you know, pants or pouches and all these things"
2351.44,2352.6800000000003, that you can put on your character.
2352.6800000000003,2354.28, And you just drag them and drop them.
2354.28,2357.0800000000004, And the assortment is pretty flexible.
2357.0800000000004,2359.76, Even though they want to have this pseudo world war 2 vibe.
2359.76,2362.0400000000004," I mean, like, I was talking to the thing I wrote about."
2362.0400000000004,2363.1600000000003," Like, I got to some brahero."
2363.16,2367.92, And there's like a guy that was like a U-boat captain with the peg leg.
2367.92,2370.64, And he had all this ridiculous stuff on.
2370.64,2374.3999999999996," I mean, you can, you can't really throw just bizarre stuff."
2374.3999999999996,2378.64," I mean, and they'll draw some stuff from Australian soldiers from World War II."
2378.64,2384.64, And then you can mix and match that with maybe like a Scott's killed or something.
2384.64,2386.16, But that was pretty fun to mess around.
2386.16,2388.72, You can't actually change the shape of the body or anything.
2388.72,2391.6, And that's partially how it works and how it's flexible.
2391.6,2393.2799999999997, But unlocking all that would be fun.
2393.2799999999997,2396.48," And I wanted to let me, you can have a team like I was like kind of sad that when I was"
2396.48,2399.2799999999997," flying the plane into San Brazil, his their open cockpit."
2399.2799999999997,2402.56," They're like, miniature size, kind of like metal slug, you know."
2402.56,2405.7, And I had my big head sticking out the top like I wanted guys sitting on the weeds in
2405.7,2406.7, San Brazil.
2406.7,2409.36," And also, I read a way to it."
2409.36,2412.6, They talk more about any of their tech potential micro-transaction models.
2412.6,2415.96," Like, to me clothing packs seems like a, yeah."
2415.96,2417.96, A harmless way to get people to spend money.
2417.96,2418.96, Right.
2418.96,2419.96, Right.
2419.96,2423.64," They, the reps, the dice reps there weren't really saying anything other than like,"
2423.64,2426.16," oh yeah, you'll be able to earn stuff and you'll be able to buy stuff too."
2426.16,2428.0," But like, what do I buy?"
2428.0,2428.7200000000003, And what do I earn?
2428.7200000000003,2430.32," Like, no real details."
2430.32,2431.32, No real details.
2431.32,2432.32, No real details.
2432.32,2433.32, I don't pay.
2433.32,2435.68, I'm sure a bad company is with giant experiment.
2435.68,2436.68, It's funny because that.
2436.68,2437.68, Yeah.
2437.68,2442.0," Now that we talk about this, it's like mass effect, which is like a port was like the only game"
2442.0,2444.96, there that wasn't like based on a business model for PC.
2444.96,2445.96, Right.
2445.96,2446.96, Because we're hammer on.
2446.96,2447.96, Yeah.
2447.96,2449.92, Because we're hammering on lines of the script.
2449.92,2450.92, I'm playing.
2450.92,2451.92," Well, left for dead."
2451.92,2452.92," Battle, oh, that's true."
2452.92,2453.92, Left up.
2453.92,2456.92, There's no ulterior motive with my left for dead except zombies.
2456.92,2457.92, That's true.
2457.92,2458.92, Yeah.
2458.92,2459.92, That's on steam.
2459.92,2462.92," Which, you know, it's like steam is a solution to the PC problem."
2462.92,2463.92, Everything that's not on steam.
2463.92,2464.92," They're like, fuck."
2464.92,2465.92, What do we do?
2465.92,2466.92, Yeah.
2466.92,2468.92, So I can't wait to talk about that.
2468.92,2472.92," Again, I mean, I didn't have much time to see everything there."
2472.92,2477.92," But to speak with the valve because in the past, they're sort of stated, you know,"
2477.92,2481.92," you know, met the dodgy for online games was, you know, really early and often, meaning"
2481.92,2484.92, get the game out and then iterate on it based on player input.
2484.92,2489.92," And this time it's like clearly they're, they've got another philosophy because it's like,"
2489.92,2493.92," yeah, they keep pushing and pushing the game and all of us are like eager to play it."
2493.92,2496.92," And every time we play it, we're like, wow, like they could release this early."
2496.92,2500.92," And yes, they would have a few bugs to iron out for the often part."
2500.92,2502.92," But like, that would be, well, sounds like five."
2502.92,2506.92," I saw an interview with Doug Lombardi from this event where he was saying, I can't remember where it was."
2506.92,2509.92, But he was saying specifically like they did kind of flip around.
2509.92,2514.92," But let's get every, let's get it out there in front of a ton of people and let them play it to death before we release it."
2514.92,2515.92, And it's probably as to do a console.
2515.92,2516.92, Yeah.
2516.92,2518.92, I don't imagine changes.
2518.92,2521.92," Every time they show it, I've never seen it show on a console."
2521.92,2524.92," That's the thing though, there may be they want to release them simultaneously."
2524.92,2526.92, And they want to make sure they're far behind.
2526.92,2531.92," Yeah, maybe they want to make sure because they can't necessarily make the changes as easily on my 360s."
2531.92,2533.92, They can't look like steam updates.
2533.92,2536.92, Maybe it's just the process is just more kind of alluded or something.
2536.92,2539.92, There's a lot of like visual refinement that they've been putting into it.
2539.92,2544.92," I mean, the the same level that they had there was the very first level I saw, like long long ago."
2544.92,2552.92," And the difference between it now and then is pretty striking just lighting, lighting things and level of detail in the environments and adding things."
2552.92,2558.92," I know they've shown the infected gameplay before, but I have a time I have never affected myself."
2558.92,2560.92, Like how the year ago.
2560.92,2566.92, But it was missing like props some of the characters were missing like you know animate first person animation and stuff.
2566.92,2572.92," Like if you were hunter and you launched on someone, they didn't have it in where you see your hands in front of you as you jump and text on down."
2572.92,2577.92," I also think it was wise though, if you're going to show that that side of the game, you shouldn't do it."
2577.92,2585.92," And I'm also leading up to Anthony Anthony's part of the showcase, but you don't show that kind of gameplay at a big press event like that."
2585.92,2592.92," Where it's just an entire zoo and everyone was packed in because from the human side, you can sit down immediately and everyone understands I got a gun."
2592.92,2594.92, I pointed it as on being I shoot it.
2594.92,2601.92," But if you're going to be zombie and infected class that you have to hide in the shadows, you wait for your one moment that might happen."
2601.92,2614.92, Like maybe once and every like four or five minutes and then you like lash someone with your tongue and your hang them so that another teammate who you're clearly not coordinating with in the way you ought to be because it's just someone you don't know sitting in a terminal next to you.
2615.92,2620.92, You're you know he's not going to be hunter and then pounds on the guy as you're hanging with your tongue or whatever like that.
2620.92,2630.92, So it's just that that's going to be something that they're going to it's probably just best shown on a one one to one basis where you can have some time to adjust to it and get used to it.
2630.92,2639.92," And they've said that like yeah, clearly playing the infected side is going to be like an art that is going to take a little more work for people than just jumping in and shooting."
2639.92,2641.92," Yeah, guys."
2641.92,2646.92," So so and that is cute and then yeah, the two for for for that was."
2646.92,2651.92, How was how was how was previewing an MMO in in that press and that environment?
2651.92,2660.92, It was pretty terrible. I mean it was because you know like the whole thing about Warhammer online is that you know they keep touting that thing that comes in dark cages.
2660.92,2675.92, And it's just a camera which is realm versus realm combat and the ability to like dramatically alter the landscape and actually permanently take land from the other side culminating and like you know they really kept talking it up like you're going to be able to take out an enemy capital city and like.
2675.92,2680.92, Kill their king and literally put his head on a stake in front of the city and stuff like that.
2680.92,2681.92, I'm just going to talk about this for you.
2681.92,2682.92, They've been talking about this for every year.
2682.92,2684.92," Yeah, that's the thing and no one has ever seen it."
2684.92,2695.92, Like they've shown PvP but they didn't show it changing anything and this time all they had set up was like they had a level one elf character from me to run around and all I was doing was like known was really there.
2695.92,2698.92, So I just walked up and started like all right right click to attack.
2698.92,2699.92, Just awesome.
2699.92,2705.92, I should ask you to ask me how is now I killed 10 harpies for some elf on horse.
2705.92,2709.92," So you know, you know, if you're a man you kill one one game, they fucking show up on another."
2709.92,2714.92, I've got to take a plague the difference between the harpies and this one though is like the harpies and Warhammer got like you know.
2714.92,2716.92, I go boobies and kill her showing.
2716.92,2719.92, I like to kill harpies and got to work because it feels real visceral.
2719.92,2721.92, Get the rip their heads off.
2721.92,2722.92," Yeah, there's nothing like this."
2722.92,2727.92," This one I swing at them and the number like 21 appears or something like that, you know."
2727.92,2728.92, It was like fall at the ground.
2728.92,2733.92, I didn't even get to create my own character which is like something that like is always like a big pleasure.
2733.92,2734.92," Well, we have any of them."
2735.92,2737.92, They should have just had video for that.
2737.92,2738.92, It's imposter those things.
2738.92,2742.92, We've how many months ago did we go see Warhammer maybe six or so for GFW.
2742.92,2746.92, Like even three of us went to play it for about five hours.
2746.92,2750.92," And we still probably could have said, but you just said, you know, that's about it."
2750.92,2751.92, That's about your quest.
2751.92,2756.92, That's a thing of a style and then they threw us into like level 20 or 30 characters for some PPP.
2756.92,2758.92, Then of course you got a new hot bar with a whole bunch of crap.
2758.92,2761.92," You don't want to do does and you're not going to learn because you know,"
2761.92,2763.92, and 10 more minute you got to move on to the next thing.
2763.92,2766.92, And the PPP for that wasn't the real versus realm either.
2766.92,2767.92, It was just a play.
2767.92,2768.92," Yeah, exactly."
2768.92,2774.92, This would be like if you did want us to preview load of the rings part two written by the guy's great grandson
2774.92,2777.92," or someone who led just to be talking, it's great, great grandson."
2777.92,2783.92," And then you start on page three, 45 and you read through page like 362 and then you put it down."
2783.92,2786.92, There's techno music playing while you do it.
2786.92,2789.92," I told him like, you know, that's what I told him."
2789.92,2794.92," It's like, you know, if you really want people to like understand your game, you really need to have like an awesome public beta"
2794.92,2798.92, or people actually get to see firsthand like how they've shaped that world and stuff like that because
2798.92,2801.92, it's a sort of the voice of suck they suck otherwise for MMOs.
2801.92,2803.92, Why play that like right.
2803.92,2807.92, It was a tough venue for any demo but for something like that in particular.
2807.92,2810.92," Yeah, they could have just had a video loop running instead maybe."
2810.92,2815.92," I mean, I'm level 14 or 15 in major Conan and I still don't feel like I have a good handle on it yet."
2815.92,2816.92, It's just weird.
2817.92,2821.92," I mean, that's one of the things that's sort of surprising that MMOs are even done."
2821.92,2825.92, It's like a class of game that can't even be explained.
2825.92,2826.92, There to me.
2826.92,2829.92," It's like, tell me, tell me about this game world of warcraft."
2829.92,2831.92, You can be a can in three minutes.
2831.92,2837.92, It can play in a basic level but then the differences are so subtle often that you can't play in how this one is different from the other one.
2837.92,2843.92," For me, I can even see when I mean, for me, I will register maybe not how it's different from World Warcraft but other MMOs."
2843.92,2848.92," Like the difference between Tabularasa, the difference between that and Guild Wars and Auto Assault and stuff."
2848.92,2856.92," But the problem is when you explain that way, what you can't communicate is why it would be fun to anyone playing it."
2856.92,2865.92," I mean, because if you do break down any like, if you break down like 10 minutes or half an hour of play from any MMO, there's no fun to be had in it."
2865.92,2872.92," So you, I mean, the reasons that people play MMOs occur like somewhere between those are across bigger periods and part of it's with"
2872.92,2875.92, with friends and all these things.
2875.92,2880.92," And when you just say that you kill shit to get high, I mean, all of them have the same thing, you know."
2880.92,2885.92," There's a huge factor of ownership too that just isn't lost in the demo where you're just,"
2885.92,2888.92," you said you were tossed to characters like, here's an alpha."
2888.92,2890.92, I would never have played enough to begin with.
2890.92,2891.92, Right. There you go.
2891.92,2893.92, I am insulted. I am not an elf.
2893.92,2898.92," Imagine Robert like you, you should have had a diva fit like that."
2898.92,2900.92, I won't be an elf.
2900.92,2902.92, I demand the warrior. Yeah.
2902.92,2903.92, Do you know who I am?
2903.92,2905.92, I'm the game critic.
2905.92,2916.92," Imagine if you took like Godawar or something, you like, and you decided you're going to stretch it out to play for about like 400 hours."
2916.92,2921.92, And you're going to massively water down the combat and all the interactive stuff like that.
2921.92,2926.92," And you're going to, you know, make it obviously massively repetitive and all these things,"
2926.92,2932.92, and what you're getting out of it is persistence and community being able to play with other people and socialize with them.
2932.92,2937.92, And then also this sense that like you're building towards something and that you're acquiring things as you play.
2937.92,2942.92," I mean, me, I'd rather just take the isolation and the better combat and the six hour,"
2942.92,2944.92," that's the other thing is, yeah, just don't like people."
2944.92,2952.92," None of these, none of these like MMO demos like that show you like the community that will build up around it or I don't know the way that grouping works like I had no idea."
2952.92,2956.92, Do you think you're this glove showed you all you need to know about the community?
2956.92,2958.92, That guy was playing battlefield.
2958.92,2960.92, Not the MMO.
2960.92,2962.92, That's your team.
2962.92,2968.92," We went to Blizzard last week and you know, we played Rathalich came for about five hours."
2968.92,2972.92, Here's a game I know inside and out and they're showing the second expansion for her.
2972.92,2980.92," And the things I wanted to learn about it, we just couldn't do like I wanted to go into a dungeon and see like how,"
2980.92,2984.92," what they learned, like how to how to make new Boston counters."
2984.92,2989.92, Obviously this is like to me like a huge area where they're just learning and changing and it's exciting.
2989.92,2992.92," I can't wait to see what they do next, but we couldn't do it."
2992.92,2994.92, This is exactly right.
2994.92,2995.92, It's just impossible even in the.
2995.92,3002.92, And even like playing the character class that I my main character is a warlock playing the in the witch king.
3002.92,3009.92," Well, it wasn't my warlock and they had the 70 to 80 skills weren't even in there."
3009.92,3010.92, Right.
3010.92,3012.92, So we didn't know I didn't know what new I was going to get.
3012.92,3015.92," So even a game like wow, that's been around for years."
3015.92,3019.92, It like you're saying a lot of us know inside out when there's was a new one to demo.
3019.92,3022.92, You still can't get what the experiences.
3022.92,3029.92," I'm saying, but as they don't do like the Charlie and the chocolate factory thing and get you guys like your actual characters and bring you out."
3029.92,3030.92, See that would be on there like.
3030.92,3032.92, Wrath of the luch king.
3032.92,3033.92, Yeah.
3033.92,3037.92, And I can't really get to keep whatever you.
3037.92,3038.92, Yeah.
3038.92,3039.92, And then you would.
3039.92,3040.92, And then you would.
3040.92,3045.92, And then you would feel like I mean imagine an MMO where you don't get to keep this stuff.
3045.92,3049.92, You don't even get to keep the experience points sort your character and that's all that matters for some people.
3049.92,3051.92, It's like called in addition to the.
3051.92,3052.92, Yeah.
3052.92,3053.92, Come rotary.
3053.92,3054.92," So yeah, I won't be able to work on this."
3054.92,3055.92, Collected farm.
3055.92,3056.92, Collected.
3056.92,3057.92, Collected.
3057.92,3058.92, Pelth farm.
3058.92,3059.92, No.
3059.92,3060.92, If you get angry.
3060.92,3062.92, We will see all our pelth's brother.
3062.92,3063.92," No, be a good good."
3063.92,3065.92, Like you have a thing or something playing that down at yay.
3065.92,3071.92, And then he's just all pissed off and like accusing the guy when he won't like given the character at the end of the day of like having used them to like fucking.
3071.92,3075.92, To get like 16 gold and 400 XP.
3075.92,3077.92, I'm the gold farmer.
3077.92,3079.92, So yeah.
3079.92,3080.92, My bitch.
3080.92,3082.92," Like for a while, I'll get it when they open up the public test."
3082.92,3084.92, I'll when they let you transfer your country.
3084.92,3085.92, And then you can play around with it.
3085.92,3086.92, But right.
3086.92,3087.92," Well, like that we're saying."
3087.92,3088.92, Of learning.
3088.92,3089.92, Right.
3089.92,3090.92, But we were saying on legendary thread.
3090.92,3092.92," You know, yesterday we were talking about age of coin in."
3092.92,3096.92," And you know, Sean and I were making some critical remarks."
3096.92,3098.92, And he's further along in the game than than I am.
3098.92,3105.92," And you know, but we did go out of our way to make the point of like, you know, you're what level 14 14."
3105.92,3106.92, Okay.
3106.92,3109.92, Like imagine reviewing World of Warcraft.
3109.92,3113.92," If you were level 14, I mean, the game is completely different."
3113.92,3114.92, Right.
3114.92,3117.92," Then I mean, that's not you're not even really playing the game yet."
3117.92,3121.92," And that's that's just him and most me and Sean were talking about this earlier this week about like,"
3121.92,3127.92," you know, like when Warha got reviewed even here, it was like a two day thing from like 3 to 4 30."
3127.92,3131.92," They did like 2 1 1 a half hour like sessions and they were like, there you go."
3131.92,3132.92, That's that's your Warha.
3132.92,3136.92," You know, like like we were saying like, you know, even with Sean always brings up company."
3136.92,3142.92," Here's an example, but it's such a good example because it's like imagine if Sean had to review that before the game came out."
3142.92,3144.92," Got to play like two games against the developers and was like, all right."
3144.92,3145.92, That's multiplayer.
3145.92,3149.92," That's why everyone that reviews understandably just talked about campaign,"
3149.92,3155.92," which you know, we're always like campaign comes and goes like a day and a half if you're if you're even playing it."
3155.92,3158.92," And then the rest is there, but it would take."
3158.92,3162.92," For both ways, not just for like, I'm going to look at Robert some feeling guilty."
3162.92,3165.92, It would take time for view certain games like that.
3165.92,3166.92, What is guilty?
3166.92,3172.92," No, but because from a consumer report or review thing versus criticism from that standpoint,"
3172.92,3178.92," the answer would be yes, you do a better job by spending more time with it because you would see that it's more valuable to you that way."
3178.92,3192.92," Likewise from if you're forming critique of any quality, you'd benefit from it as well, because you're just able to like look at it in it more depth and have had had time to think about it and you know what it what it all means."
3192.92,3197.92," Yeah, it's just so why even bothered to review multiplayer games until like a month after they come out."
3197.92,3204.92," Well, the good question because they get us they get us clicks and they sell magazines, you know, I mean, but the thing is like what about the ones that they have to play."
3204.92,3205.92, I can't remember.
3205.92,3211.92," And by human hands, yeah, you do them separately or do you just like hold back on their review or do you at changes score later on? I don't know."
3211.92,3223.92," Oh, yeah, this is a constant trick of like, yeah, we talk about the most like the warcraft I'm playing now is nothing like the warcraft I reviewed like you know, like you bring in crusade, whatever I gave it and it gave it a"
3223.92,3226.92," Absolutely, I think that MMOs could be now it's a lot of different game."
3226.92,3233.92," Yeah, now I do think we should be re reviewing MMOs regularly and giving him a new score, especially if it was like totally now."
3233.92,3238.92, We're going to do the needs and then RTS maybe just just have to change the questions.
3238.92,3243.92," Sure, just play upfront like this is the extent this is the limitations of my experience with this game."
3243.92,3248.92, And set it on the post which is why you run into the consumer report style thing for these things.
3248.92,3255.92," So, but that's what you can this is quite a lie like this this kind of ties into what we're talking about these events to talk."
3256.92,3266.92," So, with with games like that given any any time you have like a blind spot from a review or any time a review has a blind spot they go back they can to go back to the press release."
3266.92,3273.92, So it's like if you really don't know what to say about this you go to press release and it points out very conveniently for you all the things you should talk about it's it's
3273.92,3282.92, If you're creating big to have to be a person who sees these things and knows what's in them and then go online and to see the same structure reproduce everywhere else.
3282.92,3295.92, And so during right before this week where you know as this week started we had to like rush home and write previews like that battlefield thing I had to do it that night before I went to bed got home at like nine I was like you can't sleep until you turn this in and I was complaining about is like.
3295.92,3302.92, Do they know the people who organize these events that if they gave us like a week or even a couple days that they would have better stories and merge.
3302.92,3308.92, Because not only would we have more time to write about we'd have more time to think about them and Robert you were like well.
3308.92,3321.92, They don't want you think about them and they know more hard pressed you are to get this thing in quick the easier it's going to be for you to just like re-regurgitate whatever you heard during the presentation and whatever you have on your handy like.
3321.92,3326.92, These consist of presentations like the most immersive 3D experience I've ever had.
3326.92,3329.92, They're always press release is right.
3329.92,3330.92, What the fuck is 2 a.m.
3330.92,3331.92, They're always carefree.
3331.92,3337.92, They give you you know like a structure when you go see a game they want to give you something really digestible and I'd that makes sense to me.
3337.92,3341.92, I mean if you're going to go look at a game that's really complicated big you're going to have to.
3341.92,3347.92, So be given some sort of like structural sense of what they're trying to do and you're probably going to go back in the process.
3347.92,3355.92, But if you have more time to think about it more time to play it then yeah you can go off the rails and I'm sure they're not so into that.
3355.92,3365.92, I have talked to PR people who you know who job it is to write these press releases and you know you think like why why did these even exist two reads these you know but I've talked to.
3365.92,3377.92, I don't know if you're a player people who will say like oh yeah I've seen my exact sentences show up in previews or even reviews and like for them that's like a huge there is the the best time in PSE to magazine.
3377.92,3383.92, Where I found 600 words directly pasted from the press release and there cover story.
3383.92,3388.92, For the game probably control C control V school of.
3388.92,3394.92, Like like you know Carnegie Melorkey strokes to a fast article.
3394.92,3407.92, Because games like RTS is at MMOs are difficult like to to review for for these reasons I also noticed that like when you have a review of an RTS on a console they're almost entirely dedicated to talking about how.
3407.92,3417.92, Look they manage to do it they got this RTS call store on the thing and it's like because that's pretty that's an easy thing to do when you're not capable of engaging all the other stuff about the RTS and then if you look.
3417.92,3428.92, On the PC platform for like notoriously complex you know 4x games I think you'll see a lot of the same stuff you know like a lot of talking about the spreadsheets and stuff and I'm getting this from Rory who's reviewing the latest.
3428.92,3439.92, Galciv to expansion now and he was you know talking about it was like look I don't want to write about the spreadsheets and stuff and it was cool like firing him come up with his angle and his you know.
3439.92,3450.92," Yeah, it's sort of like you know idea plot for first thing but but I mean that's a problem with every it's not I mean we're always like beating up on ourselves and on the enthusiast press here but like all press always has."
3450.92,3460.92, The same narratives for everything it's like every time you read a story about a console RTS it's the does it actually work on the console.
3460.92,3468.92, Narrative every time you read a story about games and you know the newspaper it's like boy these games should make a lot of money.
3468.92,3475.92, You know and every time I'm not sure but I mean even the game's like they talk about not it's not tough.
3475.92,3482.92," Yeah, another way narrative is like for any week game is like does it use the weak controls and."
3482.92,3485.92, The fact well that's like a guaranteed like a plus for a lot of stuff.
3485.92,3490.92, Well the thing is is that a lot of times like it's been my experience that that's like what.
3490.92,3496.92, Like editorial people will tell you what to write about because they think that that's what people really want to know.
3496.92,3505.92, Like when people click on a preview about what we game as opposed to like the 360 version the only thing they care about is hearing about how the motion controls work because that's what they all bought the we for.
3505.92,3514.92, So like the same thing within our T.S. on console is does it work on this console tells about how it the interface works because that's what people want to know because it doesn't belong on a console.
3514.92,3515.92, Hmm.
3515.92,3516.92, So I just think that it's just that.
3516.92,3525.92, And there's yeah I mean there's something to be said for that I mean clearly you don't want to play in RTS on a console if it doesn't work but then when you go beyond there you're like okay so I have something that works.
3525.92,3534.92, But it's like is that all I need to know you know and then and then and then I think also like is the Royce case like what he was saying is that as he's building all this content for the game he's like look you know I.
3534.92,3542.92, When I look back at all my favorite 4x games they're always the most important thing for me is always the story I end up telling.
3542.92,3555.92, Through the action not only through his actions but through the campaigns he creates and the levels the enemies that you make and all this stuff and then looking at like what kind of stories am I telling and going from there and then once you think through this then finding what he wants to write about and it's like.
3555.92,3562.92, Hey a lot of people don't really give a shit but if you do it if you execute on this properly what what I told him might happen is like.
3562.92,3571.92, What what you do is you articulate the way things are as you understand them after you know thinking through them and if you're lucky what's going to happen is other people are going to say oh.
3571.92,3584.92, Like I told that's totally the case for me as well but I've never thought about that and then they'll start to think about the game in a different way and that's like so much more valuable and enjoyable and the law I mean of course it's not either or you could do both and you can actually do both and in one.
3584.92,3587.92, One review right but.
3587.92,3601.92, Well it takes like you just have to be like confident yourself sometimes you know like I like I'm going to show I know what people want to hear about I'm going to give them that but I'm also going to show them what I think they would be interested in hearing about as well but they don't they're not even aware of yet and you're going to tell dance.
3601.92,3602.92, In the same time.
3602.92,3603.92, No.
3603.92,3604.92, Why not.
3604.92,3611.92, I my silence is I was trying to come up with a joke for because those planes smarty pants for we and it makes you dance for like bonus points.
3611.92,3624.92, What do we what is smarty pants it's like a game casual but I contribute one think of a joke although there is a tug of war thing when like you to decide who gets to answer the next question and you're supposed to like.
3624.92,3625.92, Yeah.
3625.92,3631.92, So I was playing with the list of the last night and I was like give it like tug war and then on screen it was like showing the motion I looked at most of like you lose.
3631.92,3632.92, No.
3632.92,3635.92, That's just like.
3635.92,3639.92, That's just like a raybot.
3639.92,3642.92, But Raybots is capsule toy from Japan.
3642.92,3643.92, I got an interrupt you.
3643.92,3644.92, Sorry.
3644.92,3645.92, No.
3645.92,3650.92, And all it is it's this little thing with two buttons in a counter and it counts how many times you compress a button with 10 seconds and all this.
3650.92,3651.92, Why?
3651.92,3652.92, I don't know man.
3652.92,3653.92, You have these people are crazy.
3653.92,3658.92, So so he bought it and Ray can do like 100 to 10 seconds.
3658.92,3662.92, I can do 70 that's the best I can do and like Alice came by and she was like.
3662.92,3666.92," God, all you guys like so ridiculous when you're doing that and I was like this is our private faces."
3667.92,3669.92, Do you have that here?
3669.92,3670.92, Do you have it in the office?
3670.92,3674.92, I'm going to try that because I have the most amazing track and field skills.
3674.92,3677.92, I got this like vibrating kind of the way you have to do it.
3677.92,3678.92, Yeah.
3678.92,3679.92, Yeah.
3679.92,3680.92," Well, there's the kill."
3680.92,3681.92, The world records like 120.
3681.92,3682.92, That's the worst.
3682.92,3684.92, Anyone with the popsicle stick.
3684.92,3685.92, I agree with you.
3685.92,3686.92, We're tracking field.
3686.92,3687.92, So one of the popsicle stick.
3687.92,3688.92, Wait.
3688.92,3689.92, What do you mean?
3689.92,3691.92, Because tracking field you had to alternate between two buttons.
3691.92,3692.92, So you wouldn't just mash one button.
3692.92,3693.92, You'd have to go between them.
3693.92,3695.92, So you'd put a popsicle stick across them.
3695.92,3698.92," And then you used your finger as a folk from in the middle, right?"
3698.92,3702.92, And then you then you would do what you were saying on one side and it would automatically
3702.92,3704.92, alternate on the other side.
3704.92,3706.92," Everyone would bring, do what tracking field was to shit."
3706.92,3709.92, Everyone had it like a comb in their back pocket of popsicle stick.
3709.92,3711.92, Like the ice command will be coming by the.
3711.92,3712.92, Really.
3712.92,3714.92," I mean, going to the story."
3714.92,3715.92, It's like.
3715.92,3717.92," Oh, I love that game."
3717.92,3719.92," I mean, I realize you had to say."
3719.92,3720.92, Travelings.
3720.92,3721.92, Good.
3721.92,3722.92, That's it.
3722.92,3723.92," Oh, I can't see it."
3723.92,3724.92, I did well.
3724.92,3725.92, Pro wrestling for Nintendo entertainment.
3725.92,3726.92, Yeah.
3726.92,3727.92," Oh, my God."
3727.92,3728.92, You basically had it.
3728.92,3730.92, You got to throw your the way you're talking about as a pro wrestling.
3730.92,3731.92, Nessimulator in.
3731.92,3735.92, Just pretend it's like the equivalent of like what magic is to battle for you.
3735.92,3739.92," You like grab pretend just pretend there's like, you know, pile drivers and shit happen"
3739.92,3742.92, and when you're doing that.
3742.92,3744.92, Maybe maybe they are.
3744.92,3745.92, That.
3745.92,3746.92, That looks disillusioned.
3746.92,3749.92, I was just thinking about like how much this country's gone to hell.
3750.92,3755.92," I'm thinking about Sean and I was friends with the popsicle sticks, you know, back there with track and faith."
3755.92,3762.92," Like if they just been like applying that ingenuity in science class, you know, maybe maybe this country wouldn't be worth it."
3762.92,3766.92," Well, you use all that ingenuity like try to rip stuff off."
3766.92,3767.92, Like go standing at the hole.
3767.92,3768.92, The whole thing.
3768.92,3769.92," No, like the kid."
3769.92,3770.92, I think it's great.
3770.92,3771.92, I said it was Brian.
3771.92,3772.92, American way.
3772.92,3775.92," It was Ryan, but it wasn't really where like, well, then you know, it started."
3775.92,3778.92," We're like, you, you take and you drill a hole in the quarter and you tie fish and line through that."
3778.92,3782.92, You go to the arcade and then you just try to like trip the the coin slot at times.
3782.92,3785.92, They find a way they counter engineer against that.
3785.92,3788.92, You take to the clear tape and you I see what you're seeing.
3788.92,3791.92, You make a long string ingenuity of different types along lead on a dollar bill.
3791.92,3796.92, You stick that in the coke machine and then hit coin or turn and pull it back out and continue to do that until you're rich and cool.
3796.92,3798.92, So you're basically product testing.
3798.92,3799.92," Yeah, you're you're helping them."
3799.92,3802.92," No, but that's what I want you to do with this is leading to a clean burning."
3802.92,3806.92, Because a long ass time ago he just sorry about you shoving a dollar down the machine.
3806.92,3808.92," Yeah, he ran out."
3808.92,3817.92, Did you do that one time we did don't we made we made hot air balloons with if you go to like a like a dry cleaners and you get like a big dry cleaner bag.
3817.92,3825.92, And then you take that and we made like a with the bunch of straws and made like a a little holder down in the bottom and then you cut a can.
3825.92,3832.92, And you set that on top of the the the cross of straws and then you put sterno in it and you like the sterno sterno sterno sternos like a lick jelly.
3832.92,3833.92, It's like a rich in jelly.
3833.92,3840.92," Yeah, you feel so you like that and then of course it fills the bag with hot air and you just let it go, but this isn't something California and you're like."
3840.92,3847.92," Well, in that bag tips that burning fucking napalm just starts falling out of the combustible bag all over."
3847.92,3850.92," Yeah, that kind of thing."
3850.92,3854.92, That is the story.
3854.92,3857.92," You've we used to do these to do things with sterno to like,"
3857.92,3860.92," because I ship burns, but it doesn't burn like the stuff it's on."
3860.92,3865.92, So we used to like rub it all over our hand and light our hand on fire because it was.
3865.92,3866.92, That's not so much.
3866.92,3867.92, That's not so much.
3867.92,3868.92," Yeah, I'm darling."
3868.92,3869.92, You know what?
3869.92,3870.92, Like Judas Priest right there.
3870.92,3876.92, The greatest television show of all time is beavis and butt head because it's just fucking true.
3876.92,3878.92," But yeah, that was that was."
3878.92,3879.92," Well, that's not exactly."
3879.92,3881.92, Beavis and buy everything.
3881.92,3883.92, Why should I fucking Mr. Wizard man.
3883.92,3884.92, Don't insult me.
3884.92,3885.92," No, come on."
3885.92,3886.92, Come on.
3886.92,3887.92, This was fairly easy.
3887.92,3888.92, Everyone's invited by him.
3888.92,3889.92, What do you mean?
3889.92,3890.92, Yeah.
3890.92,3891.92, All right.
3891.92,3894.92," You might not have been just like Beavis and butt head, but you were hanging out with him at least."
3894.92,3898.92, I think I spent too much time in the marching band room after hours because I didn't do these kind of things.
3898.92,3899.92, I was in marching band too.
3899.92,3900.92, You were.
3900.92,3901.92, But this was played.
3901.92,3905.92, It was on a marching band trip when we were doing the shit with the sterno in our hotel room.
3905.92,3908.92, I just just probably ran back to the Avengers.
3908.92,3910.92," My comrade was like, four."
3910.92,3912.92," Actually, yet there was some Beavis and butt head."
3912.92,3915.92, Not like hopped to at one time at the high school.
3915.92,3920.92," P.E. they had like this deck of thing, which is I forget that stands for it's knacker and"
3920.92,3925.92," him for kids who want to go on and be like, you know, business people when they grow up and they sell assholes,"
3925.92,3930.92," knickers and cheesets and shit and went there after hours with like a glass cutter thinking that we're like,"
3930.92,3935.92, do some mission impossible shit and cut like the hole in the window and then grab all the sneakers.
3935.92,3937.92, It was like just barely scratched the window.
3937.92,3939.92, The custodian comes by.
3939.92,3941.92," He's like, hey, I know you."
3941.92,3944.92, I'm going to start running.
3944.92,3947.92, Jen's going to go home and like put a science book in his daughters and see.
3947.92,3948.92," Yeah, he's great."
3948.92,3952.92, This will be the sort of get the old stories out since it's been a while.
3952.92,3956.92," And I stopped telling them so a lot of people said they hate them online, but then I see a bunch of other people"
3956.92,3957.92, wanted here.
3957.92,3963.92," So along with the business truly beaves and butt head, at one point in my apartment company and one of the many apartment"
3963.92,3965.92, complexes I lived in is a kid.
3965.92,3968.92, Someone left their mail in their mailbox.
3968.92,3974.92," So I was like shit, and there's a mailbox key and I took it and then over the week, this was actually I need to give it the great."
3974.92,3975.92, This is third grade.
3975.92,3977.92, So you don't think I'm this much for shit.
3977.92,3980.92, So I would go over the week and take it and look for a stop at bay.
3980.92,3981.92, I don't know.
3981.92,3983.92, Maybe there's going to be a package of transformers in or something.
3983.92,3984.92, There weren't.
3984.92,3986.92, So maybe it playboy.
3986.92,3987.92, What I know.
3987.92,3988.92," Yeah, there."
3988.92,3989.92, So then I just like shit.
3989.92,3991.92, I took and I put a note in there.
3991.92,3995.92," Say if you want this mailbox key back, you got to leave five dollars under the door mat of apartment,"
3995.92,3996.92, like whatever.
3996.92,3999.92, You want to take it up and get apart in the thing.
3999.92,4004.92," And then meanwhile that same week, they got a bunch of like return checks, you know, they did it already been cash,"
4004.92,4005.92," but you know, you just get them back."
4005.92,4009.92," I don't they don't do that anymore, but they sometime in the 80s they would send you an envelope."
4009.92,4010.92, Right.
4010.92,4011.92, You're just talking about the cash.
4011.92,4015.92," So I took those around the school and that's the very same day on my elementary school, given those out."
4015.92,4017.92, The kids like their money and like this checks man.
4017.92,4018.92, And you know what the check is?
4018.92,4019.92, What's your mom with?
4019.92,4022.92," When you want that geophilia, you don't figure your mom says you don't have any money."
4022.92,4023.92, It's what you pay is for it with.
4023.92,4024.92, You can write a check.
4024.92,4025.92, Can't you mom?
4025.92,4039.92, And then so I was given these out and then I get called later in the day to the principles office and I go in there and there's my my parents are in there and then the principal and then some other person I didn't know that person introduced himself as the postmaster general of the district.
4039.92,4041.92, They hold up my like my ransom letter.
4041.92,4042.92, My story should never.
4042.92,4045.92, They're like Sean.
4045.92,4047.92, Do you know anything about this?
4047.92,4049.92, And it's a it's totally worked.
4049.92,4051.92," I was like, I know what I'm going to do."
4051.92,4052.92, So I just start crying.
4052.92,4053.92, I'm sorry.
4053.92,4054.92, I did it.
4054.92,4059.92," And then they're like, okay, we're glad that you, you know, it's really it was really brave of you to just admit that you did this."
4059.92,4060.92," It was like, what?"
4060.92,4062.92, You're fucking holding my letter out.
4062.92,4064.92," Oh, some other kid in the apartment."
4064.92,4066.92," You just have to say man, right?"
4066.92,4070.92," You thought they're going to bring out the forensics experts and like,"
4070.92,4071.92, I'm surprised you.
4071.92,4072.92, Probably bench.
4072.92,4074.92," So yeah, I'm surprised."
4074.92,4076.92, I got off with just a ass whooping on that one.
4076.92,4079.92, And because it happened off a school so I can get detention or anything.
4079.92,4087.92, But I did spend most of I remember I spent most of that year like having my lunches and all my recesses in the principal's office because I did something or the other.
4087.92,4088.92, Yeah.
4088.92,4091.92, That was just really hard to imagine somehow.
4091.92,4096.92," I don't even know what we're getting like, I mean, from fight to stuff."
4096.92,4097.92, Sometimes it would just be something dumb.
4097.92,4098.92, It would be mad.
4098.92,4099.92, I didn't understand why being trouble.
4099.92,4103.92, Like one thing anytime someone would have to take a shit.
4103.92,4105.92, You would run you to like do something.
4105.92,4106.92, Say you shit.
4106.92,4108.92, Like there's only one course of action.
4108.92,4120.92, It's a run on the playground and scream so everyone knows and you all run in and you go to the stalls next to it and you get the toilet paper then you get it wet and sink and you stand up on the adjacent stalls and urinals and you throw them down on the person taking a shit.
4120.92,4122.92, That's what you're letting us go.
4122.92,4123.92, I'm curious.
4123.92,4125.92, I'm like a lord of the fly.
4125.92,4132.92, The whole bathroom was covered with like the black tights of the wet toilet paper from us just going in there.
4132.92,4135.92," And then of course every time too, every day it's just a ritual."
4135.92,4137.92, You finish your school lunch and you take your milk carton.
4137.92,4141.92, And you know how you could rip them open in the top so it would just be like a perfectly open square.
4141.92,4145.92, And you just mix the corn that you didn't eat with whatever's left in the chocolate milk and the water.
4145.92,4149.92, You put that on the big giant like hydraulic hinge coming in the bathroom.
4149.92,4151.92, Does that have an entry door in an exit door?
4151.92,4154.92, Then you just sit in there and wait for someone to come in.
4154.92,4157.92, But now we're going to the bathroom here again.
4157.92,4162.92, No kids wouldn't you know not to go to the bathroom and in in schools because this was going to happen to you.
4162.92,4166.92, And in either his own time when in high school if fucking carried all the way to high school.
4166.92,4168.92, There's no doors on the shatters.
4168.92,4171.92, So you really didn't want to have to do so it's school.
4171.92,4176.92, So it's like maybe like doing to do some of his if Davis offices.
4176.92,4181.92, But I'm sitting there and there was like a special kid taking a dump and then.
4181.92,4183.92, Dude what's this last name?
4183.92,4184.92, Don't say it's not.
4184.92,4187.92, No no no no no.
4187.92,4189.92, Paul Parker Bansky is in the mirror.
4189.92,4190.92, Coleman is hair about you.
4190.92,4193.92, This is I swear to God this sounds like a fiction.
4193.92,4198.92, It's not he's fucking Coleman is Coleman is hair and then he's looking in the mirror and he turns around.
4198.92,4201.92, What do we have here?
4201.92,4203.92, Oh God.
4203.92,4204.92, Oh God.
4204.92,4206.92, Imagine you're right behind him taking a shit.
4206.92,4207.92, This guy's Coleman is like what?
4207.92,4208.92, Yeah.
4208.92,4209.92, And he goes he gets down.
4209.92,4211.92, I'm like kind of like oh my heart just with my hands on my knees.
4211.92,4212.92, He's like special.
4212.92,4214.92, Taking a fucking shit.
4214.92,4216.92, Take a fat shit for me.
4216.92,4217.92, Special.
4217.92,4218.92, Anything.
4218.92,4219.92, Doing that.
4219.92,4220.92, Doing the hang of this.
4220.92,4224.92, The hang of this guy's face because he was a surfer or something.
4224.92,4226.92, And then he just leaves.
4226.92,4227.92, He just walks out.
4227.92,4228.92, What a tough guy.
4228.92,4230.92, Oh my god.
4230.92,4231.92, Yeah.
4231.92,4234.92, Schools are institutions not unlike prison.
4234.92,4235.92, Yeah.
4235.92,4236.92, Seriously.
4236.92,4237.92, These are like prison stories.
4237.92,4239.92, Your daughter's go to a private school.
4239.92,4240.92, I am.
4240.92,4241.92, Yeah.
4241.92,4243.92, Actually I got a I got to say he's probably listening.
4243.92,4249.92, I got a message from a kid who goes to the private school that my daughter's going to start.
4249.92,4252.92, Next year she's about to start high school.
4252.92,4253.92, And so she got into school.
4253.92,4258.92," And anyway, this guy figured out somehow because I said her first name and he knows I live in the Bay Area."
4258.92,4263.92, He and he looked at the roster of incoming freshmen for this coming September.
4263.92,4266.92," He said hey, I just look at the roster for incoming freshman at this school."
4266.92,4270.92, I go to when I see someone name Sarah Green is that your daughter.

4337.92,4338.92, That's the right thing.
4338.92,4339.92, What do you do at the ankle?
4339.92,4340.92, Right.
4340.92,4341.92, I'm not sure you're not a swear at home.
4341.92,4344.92," No, not really except for the inadvertent, like fight, whatever."
4344.92,4349.92," Actually, the last time was well, just last night with lost wins because I kept blowing some junk."
4349.92,4350.92, That junk is some jump.
4350.92,4351.92, So I'm not y'all.
4351.92,4352.92, Fuck.
4352.92,4353.92, That's screen real quick.
4353.92,4356.92, I can just hear dead from upstairs.
4356.92,4357.92, It's okay to swear.
4357.92,4362.92," I won't cause her to swear because I remember my mom cussed like a sailor and like,"
4362.92,4364.92, I actually grew up with her just like cussing like crazy.
4364.92,4370.92, I don't think that I said a swear word in front of her until I was like 25.
4370.92,4372.92, I still don't say swear word in front of my mom.
4372.92,4376.92," I mean, I try not to you, but I mean, I don't know."
4376.92,4379.92," For someone who grew up with a mom who would you know, drop F bombs left."
4379.92,4382.92," I wasn't a big deal for me to say, I was just always afraid."
4382.92,4385.92," It's like you grew up with someone cussing and there's this thing like,"
4385.92,4387.92," Oh, you're not supposed to do that."
4387.92,4388.92, That's okay for like my mom.
4388.92,4391.92," My mom smoked and she'd always be like, do not smoke."
4391.92,4392.92, Just smoke.
4392.92,4393.92, With like smoking.
4393.92,4394.92, Yeah.
4394.92,4397.92, I was at Roberts for Thanksgiving last time.
4397.92,4399.92," His mother and I was there and I kept trying to, you were unflappable."
4399.92,4408.92," I kept trying to set him up and I'd just be like, so Robert, you still addicted to like all my gambling and stuff."
4408.92,4411.92, I was just keep doing shit like that.
4411.92,4413.92," Robert would just go along with it like, yeah, man."
4413.92,4414.92, I can't stop.
4414.92,4418.92," But for about, we always fuck with her anyway."
4418.92,4423.92, Like Sarah's mom is like super gullible and we'll just go with like anything you tell her.
4423.92,4424.92, So you didn't know.
4424.92,4428.92," It was like she wasn't she wasn't saying they're like, oh, does he online game?"
4428.92,4433.92," She was probably thinking, oh, maybe you actually please."
4433.92,4439.92, We're always like telling her like bullshit stories and she doesn't get that we're joking at first.
4439.92,4440.92, It's good.
4440.92,4441.92, It was fun.
4441.92,4442.92, It could loud loud.
4442.92,4443.92, Yeah.
4443.92,4444.92, It was not feeling guilty.
4444.92,4447.92," So about your daughter listening Jeff, your daughter listening to show her."
4447.92,4452.92," It's like, if your dad was an out bar shriner and he wrote around parades in a bumper car with the Feson,"
4452.92,4455.92, which you go to the parades the watch I wouldn't.
4455.92,4460.92, But not now you're just going to have some dude there at the school that she goes to.
4460.92,4464.92," It's going to be like, I love games for windows radio."
4464.92,4468.92," He's he's going to go up during going, you're not the Lord of the Rings."
4468.92,4472.92, What a nerd.
4472.92,4475.92," He's like, oh, he does he say that at home, too."
4475.92,4476.92, Yeah.
4476.92,4480.92, That's the guy I was playing as playing a one other thing.
4480.92,4486.92," I was playing GTA 4 the other night on the 360 and I got a, you know, you got a message from some name."
4486.92,4490.92," I didn't recognize, but I guess I approved him as a friend of a while ago and I opened up the message."
4490.92,4493.92, The message was be my dad.
4493.92,4495.92, What's your really loved.
4495.92,4496.92, Wow.
4496.92,4500.92," It's funny how there should be talk about the PM that we got, Shannon."
4500.92,4501.92," Uh oh, I don't know."
4501.92,4502.92, You don't feel comfortable.
4502.92,4503.92, I want to get out of here.
4503.92,4504.92, I'm just worried about the guy.
4504.92,4505.92," No, I want to hear it."
4505.92,4508.92, It's good as maybe even better than be my dad.
4508.92,4510.92," I hope my PM PM box, I want up."
4510.92,4512.92," And I wanted to say people, I don't always respond."
4512.92,4515.92, I always read everything that people sent me.
4515.92,4521.92," And this one was like, hey, you know, you're really cute and like, I'm just just very few,"
4521.92,4523.92," you know, gay people in the industry and stuff."
4523.92,4526.92," And it's like, here's my amname and like, just hit me up on this thing sometime."
4526.92,4529.92, And he talked about someone else in the industry who he dated.
4529.92,4531.92, And so I'm not naming anyone's names.
4531.92,4536.92," And I was like, oh, dude, I think you might mean the other shawner's been."
4536.92,4538.92," And then he was like, oh, shit."
4538.92,4541.92," He's like, yeah, as soon as I hit sand, I realized what I had done."
4541.92,4543.92," Like, it's all good."
4543.92,4546.92," But that's like, never followed up."
4546.92,4547.92, That's up there with.
4547.92,4549.92," Oh, you didn't think you're as cute."
4549.92,4550.92, John.
4550.92,4551.92," I know that was like, yeah, I'm on burn what?"
4551.92,4552.92, I'm not cute.
4552.92,4556.92," I feel like good about myself, man."
4556.92,4558.92, Now he liked to get to tour me down.
4558.92,4559.92, He just got a little.
4559.92,4560.92, He wasn't talking about me.
4560.92,4561.92," Oh, was he?"
4561.92,4563.92, Because maybe he thought you were the gay one.
4563.92,4564.92," No, he know who we know he knew."
4564.92,4566.92, It was the total mistake.
4566.92,4570.92," Like, if you put the, because it's GFW Sean, so you can imagine just type that in real quick."
4570.92,4572.92," So he was like, oh, shit, Sean Elliott."
4572.92,4573.92, Yeah.
4573.92,4575.92, That guy's a good man.
4575.92,4576.92," Oh, well."
4576.92,4581.92," Oh, no, I said that in out anyone."
4581.92,4583.92, I didn't say his name.
4583.92,4585.92, But now people do it.
4585.92,4586.92," Oh, nobody out there."
4586.92,4587.92, How did you care anyway?
4587.92,4588.92," Well, yeah."
4588.92,4589.92," You know, right."
4589.92,4592.92," But I mean, never got the follow up."
4592.92,4593.92, We don't get that.
4593.92,4596.92," Maybe he was embarrassed and wouldn't, wouldn't write you after."
4596.92,4597.92," Well, Sean."
4597.92,4600.92," The beef, the be my dead thing is good though."
4600.92,4607.92," I like that because have I ever done that at the, like, I could just randomly ask people like inventor something like the ever wish he could be your dad when you're talking about."
4607.92,4608.92, Doesn't matter.
4608.92,4611.92," You're talking about some, the most random, like inappropriate thing."
4611.92,4614.92," You're like, dude, you wish that guy could be your dad."
4614.92,4615.92, Or like me.
4616.92,4617.92, I have no idea what you do.
4617.92,4618.92, That's podcast or.
4618.92,4619.92," Oh, wow."
4619.92,4620.92, I'm sorry.
4620.92,4625.92," Or like, there's also like a for driving by the street and there's just some guy walking by you roll down the way doing like I love you dad."
4625.92,4628.92, I kind of got I took it away as like this.
4628.92,4630.92, This whole dude's playing this game.
4630.92,4631.92, My dad would never do that.
4631.92,4632.92, Yeah.
4632.92,4633.92, I wish you.
4633.92,4636.92, I had to add a d y to the end of that and it changes the.
4636.92,4638.92," Well, that's all different thing."
4638.92,4639.92, I did write back.
4639.92,4640.92," I just said, hello."
4640.92,4641.92," Well, that's kind of creepy."
4641.92,4642.92, No.
4642.92,4643.92, That's.
4643.92,4644.92, I need said.
4644.92,4645.42, I'll pay you.
4645.42,4647.92, I'm sure that that's exactly how you meant it though.
4647.92,4648.42, Yeah.
4648.42,4649.42, Like he just looks you.
4649.42,4650.42, It's like.
4650.42,4651.42, Yeah.
4651.42,4652.42, Right.
4652.42,4660.42, I got I got one that said I was also playing GTA and I got one that said I love Jeff in a non sexual way.
4660.42,4662.42," You know, they're nice."
4662.42,4663.42, Yeah.
4663.42,4668.42, But I do not I've railed on this before I don't like the messaging coming up in the middle of games.
4668.42,4669.42, An Xbox life.
4669.42,4670.42, I don't.
4670.42,4671.42, It does really annoying.
4671.42,4672.42, I do.
4672.42,4674.42, I've seen that one when I profile that the name is.
4674.42,4675.42, I sent you a link.
4675.42,4676.42, Jeff.
4676.42,4678.42, It was like the profile name for one up user.
4678.42,4680.42, I had I slept with Jeff Green.
4680.42,4682.42, That was the profile name.
4682.42,4683.42, Yeah.
4683.42,4684.42, Yeah.
4684.42,4685.42, I know.
4685.42,4686.42, I'm just wanting to know who that is.
4686.42,4687.42, I'm like.
4687.42,4688.42, Did I?
4688.42,4691.42, Are you cute?
4691.42,4693.42, You're not part of this person's identity.
4693.42,4694.42, Right.
4694.42,4697.42, You've kind of got the market cornered and being like one of the only.
4697.42,4704.38," People writing about games as, you know, having a family and being a grown-up and writing a"
4704.38,4708.38," character, you know, about the ridiculousness of being like super into games and simultaneously"
4708.38,4710.38, supposedly being a responsible person.
4710.38,4711.38, That's my niche.
4711.38,4712.38," So, yeah, but it's cool."
4712.38,4717.38," I mean, like as I get older, like I want to read stuff like that, not about, you know, the"
4717.38,4718.38, teen.
4718.38,4720.38," Well, the thing is, you know, the thing is."
4720.38,4721.38, Yeah.
4721.38,4727.38," The thing is we're all going to be, I'm just a little bit ahead of you guys."
4727.38,4728.38, Yeah.
4728.38,4729.38, No.
4729.38,4732.38, But that's what I'm hoping I'm alive when that happens.
4732.38,4736.38, When the world is just full of people who are gaming their whole life and their kids are
4736.38,4739.38," gaming, and it will be a beautiful thing to see."
4739.38,4741.38," And please, God, let me live for that day."
4741.38,4742.38, I'm really waiting for it.
4742.38,4743.38, We need all those people.
4743.38,4747.38, We're happy there when we're talking about the toxicostics and tracking field.
4747.38,4751.38," I mean, there's like a large portion of audience who has no idea what to do."
4751.38,4756.38, Don't you think it's going to be a better world when there's no fucking deal with on TV or running
4756.38,4757.38, for office.
4757.38,4759.38, It's going these video games.
4759.38,4761.38," You know, it's like the same thing with TV now."
4761.38,4764.38, There's going to be a day when none of those fuckers are going to be alive anymore.
4764.38,4765.38, I can't wait for it.
4765.38,4773.38, I don't know if you all people are what is saying about us though for people who hate on anime and like who people who
4773.38,4775.38," Okay, music that is true."
4775.38,4776.38, That's true.
4776.38,4778.38, Our day will come.
4778.38,4779.38, I know.
4779.38,4780.38, The day when I know.
4780.38,4781.38, The one is in the fur.
4781.38,4784.38, What I want to do today when I'm not wanted anymore.
4784.38,4785.38, And I'll probably be ready to go.
4785.38,4787.38, What I'm ready for.
4787.38,4803.38," I'm ready for the day when it's no longer cool to pretend that you don't like games or to be like a total, you know, totally ignorant of games."
4803.38,4809.38," Like I hate that every time I read some like young hip thing saying, you know, oh, I don't play video games."
4809.38,4814.38, I'm always I was read a pitchfork media's like list review with bands.
4814.38,4815.38, Yeah.
4815.38,4819.38, And I always immediately just go down to where they ask them what game they're playing because I want to see what they say.
4819.38,4825.38," 90% of the time they're like either they're like, oh, like, pick me or they're like, I don't put games."
4825.38,4826.38, I don't have time for that.
4826.38,4827.38, People sell a fuck up.
4827.38,4829.38," Man, you know, like what are you talking about?"
4829.38,4830.38, What are you talking about?
4830.38,4835.38," Like when you say that like the series of celebrity interviews because it would always be like, oh, yeah, I played pack."
4835.38,4840.38," When I was a kid or it'd be like, I play GTA and I just like to, I don't play the missions."
4840.38,4842.38, I just like to drive around and running the stuff.
4842.38,4848.38, I did read every time that would be the last week's entertainment weekly had a two-page profile of Josh Grobin.
4848.38,4850.38," You know, that guy is, Josh Grobin."
4850.38,4853.38, He's gone on and on and on and on and on is Amazon reviews.
4853.38,4854.38," Well, it's a concert."
4854.38,4855.38," Yeah, I've read his Amazon."
4855.38,4862.38, If you ever really want to good time go to Amazon.com and read read reviews of Josh Grobin stuff.
4862.38,4864.38, I haven't talked about this on the past.
4864.38,4866.38," Yeah, the grobin nights, right?"
4866.38,4869.38, So he says you just want to hate him without ever having heard his music.
4869.38,4872.38," And then when you hear it, then you really hate him."
4872.38,4878.38," But because he's like in his 20s and he's like this baritone, like he sings this like pop opera, crap, whatever."
4878.38,4880.38," Anyway, he just said."
4880.38,4886.38," And the first sign that he was cool is when he showed up on that, um, the I fuck Matt Damon thing."
4886.38,4887.38," Or there, no, it was a sequel."
4887.38,4888.38, The I fucked.
4888.38,4889.38, What was it?
4889.38,4890.38, I'm fucking mad Damon.
4890.38,4891.38, Then I'm fucking mad.
4891.38,4892.38, The one that's like the other one.
4892.38,4893.38," Yeah, that one."
4893.38,4896.38," Anyway, so in the new entertainment weekly there's a two-page profile."
4896.38,4898.38, And he goes on and on about GTA.
4898.38,4903.38," Well, it's like a, in a non-layam way, like you can tell it's really playing."
4903.38,4910.38," It's like a Vin Diesel when all my friends found out that he like, you know, he was on like the Conan O'Brien show talking about how he's like a huge D&D player."
4910.38,4914.38," He's always been like, and that's why he like worked on that."
4914.38,4915.38, That Chronicles are really the game.
4915.38,4916.38, That's right.
4916.38,4919.38, That's super important to him because he loves playing video games all the time.
4919.38,4920.38, Yeah.
4920.38,4921.38, Yeah.
4921.38,4923.38, It's like people latch on to famous people like that who don't just blow it off.
4923.38,4926.38," That's great when they have on our side too because he's a big dude, you know."
4926.38,4928.38, He's not a nerdy.
4928.38,4929.38, Yeah.
4929.38,4935.38," I wanted to interview Robin Williams, like say what you want about his comedy and some forms of stuff, but just as a gamer, for the longest time."
4935.38,4938.38," And I actually did like I was trying to, this would be like my score."
4938.38,4944.38," Like I was trying to get it for, you know, when we were at CHFW because he's like, you know, he was always at the E3 sport things."
4944.38,4946.38, I heard that he plays battlefield.
4946.38,4949.38," He named one of his kids after the legend Zelda and like,"
4949.38,4950.38, Did they really match the game?
4950.38,4951.38, Legend of Zelda?
4951.38,4952.38, No.
4953.38,4954.38, That's a fight for a ship wisdom.
4954.38,4955.38, That's a Zelda.
4955.38,4957.38, Don't hear me in the Zelda.
4957.38,4962.38," But I mean, Dad, like the people like that that are like actually, you don't talk to them about like,"
4962.38,4963.38, Right.
4963.38,4964.38, Yeah.
4964.38,4965.38, I don't know how to pick that up.
4965.38,4968.38, No one's picked up the patch Adams license.
4968.38,4969.38, For a game.
4969.38,4973.38," I saw the guy that, you guys, do you guys know a rest of development?"
4973.38,4974.38, Yeah.
4974.38,4977.38," The guy that played Job, he was extremely funny."
4977.38,4978.38, You know the magician character.
4978.38,4979.38, Yeah.
4979.38,4980.38, He will learn that.
4980.38,4981.38, Yeah.
4981.38,4982.38, Yeah.
4982.38,4986.38," He was on Conan O'Brien like, jamming on for like five minutes about being addicted to playing"
4986.38,4990.78," Multiplayer, Call of Duty 4 and like, you wear in the headset and it's wife like making"
4990.78,4992.38, fun of him all the time.
4992.38,4995.38," And that sort of surprised by the John Stuart, a gamer."
4995.38,4996.38," Oh, that's true."
4996.38,4997.38, Yep.
4997.38,4998.38, Yeah.
4998.38,5000.38," He's actually, I was in the second wife."
5000.38,5002.38, John Stuart's in the second life.
5002.38,5003.38," Oh, God."
5003.38,5004.38, Was that reveal about him?
5004.38,5005.38, Yeah.
5005.38,5006.38, He ever gets busted in the game.
5006.38,5007.38, Are you being serious?
5007.38,5008.38, No.
5008.38,5009.38, I think he's getting it.
5009.38,5010.38, They had a good GK one too.
5010.38,5011.38, Did you see that?
5011.38,5013.38, They got reporting from live in Liberty City.
5013.38,5014.38, Yeah.
5014.38,5015.38, Yeah.
5015.38,5016.38, Yeah.
5016.38,5017.38, Funny.
5017.38,5019.38, Celebrities play games too.
5019.38,5020.38, That was awesome.
5020.38,5021.38, Remember that.
5021.38,5022.38, Yes.
5022.38,5023.38, Did they blow their nose?
5023.38,5024.38, Yeah.
5024.38,5026.38, We were basically engaged in the main version of the life.
5026.38,5027.38, It's like Chris Farley showed.
5027.38,5028.38, Okay.
5028.38,5029.38, Magazine like or pee.
5029.38,5030.38, Celebrities.
5030.38,5031.38, They're just like us.
5031.38,5032.38, And then it's like.
5032.38,5033.38, Then with no fucking makeup on.
5033.38,5034.38," Gary, don't take it."
5034.38,5035.38, Yeah.
5035.38,5037.38, They're going to see where validated now.
5037.38,5038.38, But the difference.
5038.38,5042.38," If we wanted, if we were willing to buy magazine full of pictures of celebrities playing video"
5042.38,5048.38," games, then we would be at that rock bottom point of my do that."
5048.38,5049.38, Magazine.
5049.38,5050.38, Like it's a great time.
5050.38,5055.38, The version for us would be to prove like screen caps of their gamer scores and stuff to prove that they
5055.38,5056.38, suck.
5056.38,5061.38," So like for the woman to prove that like Cameron Diaz has got like, is it's you are now a man or is like, you know,"
5061.38,5064.38, when that that she has makeup on when she does films.
5064.38,5065.38, I bet if they was they suck.
5065.38,5066.38, I fuck.
5067.38,5071.38, What?
5071.38,5075.38," Yeah,"
5075.38,5076.38, It's like a photo spread of clothes.
5076.38,5081.38, We're watching warcraft six hala navigating whatever they put it.
5081.38,5094.38, Do they?
5094.38,5101.38, We can do what class would each lock lost character play in wow.
5101.38,5105.38," Well, we don't shot shots."
5105.38,5107.38, Here we go.
5107.38,5108.38, Look at this.
5108.38,5113.38," We totally, we're so we didn't even finish the E3 week thing."
5113.38,5116.38, So the finish finished the E thing.
5116.38,5122.38," There's dead space which I was really looking forward to seeing, but I didn't get to see it and then it doesn't matter because it's a barcode."
5122.38,5132.38, It's a great place to draw inspiration from that.
5132.38,5137.38," Anyway, no."
5137.38,5139.38, You don't know what the name is.
5139.38,5140.38, Is that it from you?
5140.38,5141.38, I don't know.
5141.38,5142.38, I don't know.
5142.38,5143.38, I don't know.
5143.38,5144.38, I don't know.
5144.38,5145.38, I don't know.
5145.38,5146.38, I don't know.
5146.38,5147.38, I don't know.
5147.38,5148.38, I don't know.
5148.38,5149.38, I don't know.
5149.38,5150.38, I don't know.
5150.38,5151.38," You don't, you don't know."
5151.38,5152.38, Is that it from me?
5152.38,5153.38, I don't know.
5153.38,5154.38, What else we see?
5154.38,5155.38, He had a pretty good.
5155.38,5156.38, They did not show sport.
5156.38,5160.38, They had a cool video to introduce their show.
5160.38,5161.38, No.
5161.38,5163.38, My favorite part really didn't.
5163.38,5168.38," I like the, I like the kind of, you know, the graphics on that."
5168.38,5169.38, Yeah.
5169.38,5170.38, They were being facetious when I say it.
5170.38,5172.38," No, I like the typeface."
5172.38,5173.38, What was this?
5173.38,5174.38, I forgot it.
5174.38,5178.38," They just, it was just one of those standard waste of time, 15 minute montage."
5178.38,5181.38," This is really fast of why you say, type the movie."
5181.38,5182.38, Yeah.
5182.38,5186.38," Oh, so you're talking with some cat's line, you know, some between the game thing or"
5186.38,5187.38, we're ready to play.
5187.38,5188.38, We're ready to play.
5188.38,5189.38," You know, one of us."
5189.38,5192.38," And also, all right, didn't that look great?"
5192.38,5193.38, Yeah.
5193.38,5198.38," The bullshit like like revolutionary like screenplay, much of fist pointing up together at"
5198.38,5200.38, you at an EA logo.
5200.38,5201.38, Yeah.
5201.38,5203.38, These are the bullshit.
5203.38,5204.38, Yeah.
5204.38,5205.38, We're not a game publisher.
5205.38,5206.38, It's a movement.
5206.38,5207.38, Yeah.
5207.38,5208.38, Yeah.
5208.38,5209.38, Yeah.
5209.38,5210.38, Yeah.
5210.38,5211.38, Yeah.
5211.38,5212.38, Yeah.
5212.38,5216.38," So I guess we could go move on to, I mean, if you guys would be so good."
5216.38,5218.38, We should talk about the Microsoft event.
5218.38,5221.38," I heard they're showed like, what, Pedro, because we are something."
5221.38,5222.38, Was that Andrew?
5222.38,5223.38," Actually, we weren't."
5223.38,5224.38, We weren't at Microsoft.
5224.38,5225.38, I heard good things about the Android.
5225.38,5229.38, I think even though Neo Gaff was like going absolutely fucking bonkers about it.
5229.38,5230.38," Like in a good way, right?"
5230.38,5234.38," I heard that the, the, the, the, the, the vehicle creation stuff was really"
5234.38,5235.38, fun.
5235.38,5236.38, Yeah.
5236.38,5237.38, Yeah.
5237.38,5238.38, Yeah.
5238.38,5239.38, Yeah.
5239.38,5240.38, Yeah.
5240.38,5241.38, Yeah.
5241.38,5242.38, Yeah.
5242.38,5243.38, Yeah.
5243.38,5244.38, Yeah.
5244.38,5245.38, Yeah.
5245.38,5246.38, Yeah.
5246.38,5247.38, Yeah.
5247.38,5248.38, Yeah.
5248.38,5249.38, Yeah.
5249.38,5250.38, Yeah.
5250.38,5251.38, Yeah.
5251.38,5252.38, Yeah.
5252.38,5253.38, Yeah.
5253.38,5254.38, Yeah.
5254.38,5255.38, Yeah.
5255.38,5256.38, Yeah.
5256.38,5257.38, Yeah.
5257.38,5258.38, Yeah.
5258.38,5259.38, Yeah.
5259.38,5260.38, Yeah.
5260.38,5261.38, Yeah.
5261.38,5262.38, Yeah.
5262.38,5263.38, Yeah.
5263.38,5263.88, Yeah.
5264.88,5265.88, Yeah.
5265.88,5266.88, Yeah.
5266.88,5267.88, Yeah.
5267.88,5268.88," That was like, somebody's laughing."
5268.88,5269.88, Do that.
5269.88,5270.88, I was in the comments like symbolic sentence.
5270.88,5271.88, Yeah.
5271.88,5273.88, But there's somebody else's to there's to there's to whatever it could do that.
5273.88,5274.88, Is my words a little wind거�ks.
5274.88,5275.88," But dancing like, oh put it on like this yeah."
5275.88,5277.88," Smooth mind hustling like this yeah yeah, it was just like slowly mono."
5277.88,5293.72," Can I, by doing it with my money, it's about really pushing my word out"
5293.72,5296.72, you're saying that you don't like the levels where you have to throw the
5296.72,5300.2, thing. I'm talking about the thing that are shooting out. It's like it's just
5300.2,5302.96," like good. Oh, I haven't gotten that far. It's like this is a full"
5302.96,5306.72," level. No, I need you. This is a case of the game where less would have been"
5306.72,5310.400000000001, more in my life. Yeah. Yeah. Like what? I was a crap that shouldn't be there
5310.400000000001,5314.04, that you kind of have to do. It's like get through stuff. It's like the
5314.04,5317.88, I haven't beaten the first whole section. One way you need like 900 points
5317.88,5321.280000000001, or something. I'm like half that many. I was really disappointed when
5321.28,5324.32, I was playing with a friend and we got to this point where it was like
5324.32,5326.88," bunch of that stuff and I'm like, oh, turn this off. Let's play"
5326.88,5332.639999999999," Grand Theft Auto. And even like on a smaller scale, like the puzzles where"
5332.639999999999,5336.04," you're protecting a castle, but that all that means is throwing shit at"
5336.04,5339.28, again. It's basically throwing shit at monkey. Although that's fun.
5339.28,5343.96, That's fun with two people. Like you can play the castle game with two
5343.96,5346.84, people and it's like you're you get a limited number of shots and you're
5346.84,5349.44," trying to see who can. We're not talking about that. Oh, you're talking"
5349.44,5352.719999999999, about where you're actually throwing blocks to destroy a castle. He's talking
5352.719999999999,5355.5199999999995, about where you're protecting such ships from guys that are trying to take
5355.5199999999995,5358.879999999999, them. You're just basically blown. You don't want to hit the castle at all.
5358.879999999999,5361.759999999999," Instead, you want to just hit the guys walk around the screen and at that"
5361.759999999999,5364.44," point, it's basically another like a game with the difference being that you"
5364.44,5368.4," you make a throwing motion to shoot. Yeah. There's, yeah. So there's"
5368.4,5371.44, there's some there's a big chunk of this game. Yeah. There really is.
5371.44,5374.24, So the thing that's the thing I think that's the most disappointing about
5374.24,5379.599999999999, that game is like the weeds online suck so bad that like no one's really
5379.599999999999,5382.44, going to take advantage of the fact that you can create levels and share them
5382.44,5385.0, with your friends and stuff like that. You don't think about something that could
5385.0,5390.48," over time make grower. I hope so, but I don't. I'll never use it. I mean,"
5390.48,5393.5599999999995," even if it was like a great system, I doubt I would ever download it. I'd rather"
5393.5599999999995,5397.04, just have something that let me like just download a selection of stuff. Like
5397.04,5400.04, it'd be cool if you could bait if you if the people who like to build levels
5400.04,5403.96, could just upload them and then and then you could just download like a random
5403.96,5407.16, a story. Yeah. Because then that would make sense without helping.
5407.16,5410.84, It would be good because it needs more. I got around playing the multiplayer part
5410.84,5413.4800000000005," that everyone was saying like, oh no, no, no, wait, you can't talk. You"
5413.4800000000005,5416.28," can't play the multiplayer. So I got to that and it's like, there aren't that"
5416.28,5420.68, many puzzles and things and like it would be awesome if what you were saying
5420.68,5424.64, was available is just going to get people stuff. Yeah. Because I really like
5424.64,5428.44, the Django thing. Yeah. That's the cool thing. You know what? It's annoying to
5428.44,5432.56," me. I do like, I only like the color Django one because when you play the"
5432.56,5438.4800000000005," regular one, there's no incentive to I mean, other than, you know, to take a"
5438.4800000000005,5442.4400000000005," high risk maneuver and pull from the bottom. Otherwise, you just like"
5442.4400000000005,5445.04," doing all these piss ant moves from the top. And so what I was like is like, you"
5445.04,5448.68," should get more points for pulling for for risky your tugs, you know, for"
5448.68,5451.92," way. Yeah. That's a good point. And so they kind of have that with colored things,"
5451.92,5455.240000000001, but not quite. It just gives you a good restriction on the type you could pull.
5455.240000000001,5459.0," And then in addition, I wanted like even so I went to options hoping I could do"
5459.0,5463.56, all this. Can I have that? Can I set a timer? Because then it could take an
5463.56,5466.56," off the long time, of course. If people are being super cautious, it's not from the"
5466.56,5470.04," top of the stack. You can't put a timer on. And I mean, little things like that,"
5470.04,5473.12, it wouldn't have taken very long at all. I had to put both options. The thing is
5473.12,5476.08," is how do you get gold on that? Because most of the time, I find that they do"
5476.08,5479.88," make it more challenging by like giving their ranks. So on that, what you're saying"
5479.88,5483.44," in this straight, you don't, you don't get gold at all. What happens is you get five"
5483.44,5487.0, points for every pull you make and you lose a point for every block. You didn't
5487.0,5491.16, attempt to pull that touch it that falls to the ground. So there's no like you're not
5491.16,5496.24," pulling. This is what you say. Yeah, but it's a different set up. I enjoyed the one"
5496.24,5500.36," where you try to knock down a certain amount of point, like the one where you knock down"
5500.36,5504.52," what you can. And then the point blocks all fall and however many you collect. Oh,"
5504.52,5507.68, yeah. That one is the one I had the most one with multiplayer. Did you play that one?
5507.68,5510.68," I did, but I mean, we want to make sure we're talking about the same one. There's"
5510.68,5514.96, there's a bunch of point blocks and you knock them into to fields that are worth like
5514.96,5519.0," multiple fires. No, that's like the shuffle board kind of game. I like that too. That"
5519.0,5522.88, was a good one. When that be cool if you could just grab it instead and then flick it like
5522.88,5527.04," a shot instead of having to hit it. Yeah, that would be nice. This one is just purely"
5527.04,5531.76, whatever you knock off is added to your score. Right. Okay. I see those. Without
5531.76,5538.12," hit any specific. Yeah, I like those. That's a cool. Yeah, I like this better than I"
5538.12,5543.52," like I don't know. Maybe because I'm prone to like a perfectionism in games, I get"
5543.52,5547.320000000001, really compulsive about that one that you play single player where you get your
5547.320000000001,5551.320000000001," trying to knock down all the blocks at once and you get a gold if you do it. Oh, yeah."
5551.320000000001,5555.160000000001, That's how I play there. That's my thing. I'll just sit there and do it over and over again.
5555.160000000001,5559.320000000001," And I'm like, I don't I don't consider myself a winner to like at the one. Yeah. One hit."
5559.320000000001,5563.080000000001, And it's fun. I just find that like one spot that knocks the whole thing that makes
5563.080000000001,5566.080000000001, the chain reaction. Yeah. That's there'd be another thing that would be great for
5566.080000000001,5570.52, multiplayer. If it was had a split screen and you basically took turns. You each had three
5570.52,5574.280000000001, walls and then you see and it presents those exact same levels that you're talking
5574.280000000001,5578.200000000001," about where you can possibly get it in a single one or in two or three. I mean, like I was"
5578.200000000001,5582.64, like hoping for that. I ended up kind of liking some of the levels on the single player
5582.64,5587.400000000001," more than the multiplayer one. I do have to say I had not to talk about my kid again, but"
5587.400000000001,5594.240000000001, I did play boom blocks with her a while ago. And she took this was just like a great
5594.48,5601.44, commercial for school for getting edged and he took a physics class this year. And I was playing
5601.44,5605.32, with her and there were a few of those points where I was trying to get the one hit. And I
5605.32,5610.0, didn't know what to do. And she was actually looking at the screen and figuring it out from
5610.0,5615.88," physics and explaining to me why it would work. Wait, how old you're done? She's 14. She's an eighth"
5615.88,5620.32, grade and she's taking physics. Yeah. She took some like advanced things. I was taking a class.
5620.32,5628.599999999999," She got reading. She got her mom's brain. For me, she knows how to play wow. She needs"
5628.599999999999,5634.719999999999," to start and how to start starting her neighbors. But they worked. I mean, I was like,"
5634.719999999999,5639.639999999999," you're smart. It's going to be an engine. Yeah, it was incredible. It blew me away. And"
5639.639999999999,5643.28," then she would say like, yeah, that is because the negative space created by the bit of them."
5643.28,5653.96," You're like, whatever. And it's not like giving. If any girls like you. I mean,"
5653.96,5658.08, a lot of it's just like an intuitive type of physics. Sure. I know it. Like comes
5658.08,5663.759999999999," hard. She wasn't even mind flying. You know, maybe she does see. I'm not saying that smart."
5663.759999999999,5669.04," I've said that. No, I know it. Yeah. But here's the thing though, if she becomes a physicist"
5669.04,5674.08," be aware of, I mean, be wary of you. You have cases like my old roommate who is not"
5674.08,5678.08," constantly very into, I mean, not roommate, but guy on the same floor of the dorms was way into"
5678.08,5684.32," magic together. But when someone jumped from our 12 story dorm, killed himself. He read everyone's"
5684.32,5687.68," downstairs freaking out and told everyone to like, you know, leave the building. And the first thing"
5687.68,5692.24," he does is he's like, he's like, I got to go back up and like, why, and he did his like algorithm"
5692.24,5698.48, calculator. So he could like work out all these equations ahead of do with this guys. He was
5698.5599999999995,5702.24," like totally in the terminal loss. Yeah. He was laughing or anything. He was just like,"
5702.24,5705.679999999999," wow, he wanted to add it. I'm not going to equate her with that. I'm like,"
5705.679999999999,5711.679999999999, often I'm trying to poison his professors. And I don't think you have to actually be like an
5711.679999999999,5720.719999999999," emotional, unless, you know, math obsessed person get into physics. No, yeah. He had emotions, man."
5720.719999999999,5723.679999999999," I liked physics. Curiosity. Wait, that's not an image."
5724.320000000001,5731.76," I'm feeling very curious shot in front of her. I think we can't, uh, I think we can't talk"
5731.76,5735.52," about any of the other ones yet, right? Because on that's a fact, but that's kind of played."
5736.320000000001,5740.72," What can we say about mass effect? Oh, the A. Nothing. Next."
5743.52,5749.04," The PC one has way better frame rate. Yeah. It looks like a lot of times, way better. You"
5749.04,5753.44," have fully customizable like button layout. Yeah. That's right. You troll your squad members individually,"
5753.44,5757.2," but you can't take it or control them. That would be the step that I'm still isn't there,"
5757.2,5762.88, like a tactical map to or overlay or it's just the interface is better. It's just to give you more
5762.88,5767.68," options. Additional missions. They, they, no, they all they're doing is they're letting you download,"
5767.68,5772.16," uh, bring down the sky at unpack that they had for 360. Oh, they won for free."
5773.2,5777.28," Which is a little odd. I've heard two different stories when they brought, when they brought it over"
5777.36,5781.84," on Friday. Last Friday to show it, they were like, well, we just didn't, you know, it would have,"
5781.84,5786.08, we would have had to like delay it a little further to actually add it to the retail copy. And then
5786.8,5790.5599999999995," when we were at the event, they were like, oh, we just wanted to get people to experience,"
5790.5599999999995,5795.84, but it's like to download content. I buy number one over number two. Yes. Number two is as a spin.
5795.84,5802.5599999999995," And not sure if people need to experience what it's like to download content. Yeah. It's,"
5802.5599999999995,5806.88," you know, PC gamers never download content. Right. Never experience that"
5807.36,5812.16," amazing thing. I mean, if I, if I had to go back in time and not play the 360 version,"
5812.16,5817.12, I would have held out for the PC one. It's improved enough. Yeah. I didn't touch that game. So maybe
5817.12,5821.84," I didn't enjoy it. Now is the time I've been. Yeah, I've been meaning to try it. Yeah. I mean,"
5821.84,5825.5199999999995," wait for the PC one and a couple of weeks if you're going to try it. Like I wanted to play through,"
5825.5199999999995,5829.679999999999," like, that was a slow burn for me. Like at first took me like eight hours to"
5830.639999999999,5834.4," there it came. It convinced myself that like, hey, that's actually as good. And then by the time I"
5834.4,5837.839999999999," got to the end, I was like, oh, I just should play this again as the bad guy or a really good guy,"
5837.839999999999,5841.839999999999," actually, because I played way up. And I was like when I heard about the PC one, I'll wait for that"
5841.839999999999,5849.92, before I do that. Yeah. Yeah. So cool. Cool. Cool. I like video games.
5853.599999999999,5860.4," Okay. I do too. So many other events stuff. Well, I think the rest is sort of in bar good. Now,"
5860.4,5864.32," I think we're caught up to real time here. Any of us would play anything new or interesting,"
5864.32,5871.759999999999, then? I played lots wins. Yeah. We're already talked about it. So I'm talking to
5871.759999999999,5879.679999999999, I with this morning. I could still play Super T. So I could still be a great game for we
5880.799999999999,5885.679999999999," multiple, I got it from multiplayer. My end of the coast. I got it 49. That's called."
5885.679999999999,5888.879999999999," Yeah. And the reason I got it is because they have a, you be so close."
5888.88,5893.6," Whole series of my X coach, like I actually had like my French coach that was like for"
5893.6,5897.4400000000005, last time I was on a plane. I was messing with that. But we got it for because the back of the
5897.4400000000005,5903.92, box makes it looks like multiplayer bookworm type games. And that is what I went in hoping to have.
5903.92,5907.68, And now it was bomb because imagine if you had like Bonnie's bookstore or like bookworm and stuff
5907.68,5912.08," and it was just on your Wii, had a split screen and you just use your Wii mode to like circle"
5912.08,5916.400000000001, the words that you find and you try to find more than the other person. Great game to play with Melissa.
5916.719999999999,5921.839999999999, But it's one of those games where you have to unlock all the multiplayer modes and individually.
5921.839999999999,5926.0, So every type of multiplayer game in there you have to unlock. And it's not like a quick type thing.
5926.0,5930.799999999999, It's like Ryan was talking about the most like what's like fucking getting the oversaw
5930.799999999999,5935.04, in T-Vorches. I was going to say like getting carts and Mario carpets. Probably more like getting
5935.04,5939.759999999999, the oversaw in T-Vorches for you to play multiplayer. You know what the big like it's going
5939.759999999999,5942.719999999999, back to the store fucking. You know what the Wii needs a game genie.
5942.72,5950.16," You met that sort of calls for me. Yeah, like fuck that. I'm going to put in the game genie code."
5950.16,5954.400000000001, I do have the Paul Jones because I said that that was like tended to be more typical of
5954.400000000001,5960.0, Japanese games but this was made by Ubisoft Montreal. So Canadian games too.
5960.0,5966.400000000001," Not a very good game. Wait wait for my life coach. Yeah, it'll be like some guy coming on the screen."
5966.4,5975.04," Me and be like, love yourself. Get organized. Oh god. Put procrastinating. Take off the"
5975.04,5980.879999999999," figure this one. We play games to get away from that shit. Yeah, smarty pants is pretty fun."
5980.879999999999,5984.08," I recommend that to you guys. Yeah, good game. I like it. I like it. I like it on Facebook."
5984.08,5990.639999999999, We play it with the on the Wii with your family. Yeah. It's another game show quiz type
5990.639999999999,5995.839999999999, type thing on Wii but the interesting thing is you put your your agent and it will
5995.84,6000.400000000001, like tune a question accordingly. And that way you're not getting like these questions about
6000.400000000001,6006.400000000001, fucking silent film and it also or super hot. But it also it also adjust if you're really good or
6006.400000000001,6010.0, really bad at something. So if you like fail at every science question and it'll like take you down
6010.0,6015.2, like a six year old. Yeah. Yeah. There's another problem with this. Every time I play these games
6015.2,6018.96, they're like I'm just playing fun for most of the hard because I want to like I know like just
6018.96,6022.96, shut up just play the game with your don't sit here and be a critic and it's like I always get
6022.96,6027.04, angry at like the tiny little things that could have done to improve the game. So like in
6027.04,6031.04, in that one well like for you know boombox where playing I was like God why can't I put like
6031.04,6035.36, point values on these or why can't I just put a time on in this thing. It's like they're
6035.36,6040.0, they're whole categories that I would like to go to the options menu and take out market sports
6040.0,6044.16, neither most are or I know the fucking first thing about it. It's like if the question is
6044.16,6048.56, about Michael Jordan work just take against getting it wrong. Mohammed Ali is the other one. Yeah.
6048.56,6055.200000000001, I'm like like like bow or something right there. The question is does bow no true or false.
6058.56,6063.360000000001, That was always the last pie I got in triple pursuit. Yeah that's that was always like the
6063.360000000001,6069.04, obstacle like can you get the spot. So that would have been one thing I wanted to to pull
6069.04,6072.400000000001, there I can't remember now with there a bunch of little things that would have been well she
6072.400000000001,6077.04, liked that that was fair because there's a gaming category and of course it has card games and
6077.04,6081.6, crafts and stuff but it's largely video games and so that I have a huge advantage there and
6081.6,6086.0, I was like okay but then this is you have the fashion one but the fashion one to same thing.
6086.0,6091.2, Do you guys argue about this because I've I have played many golf with John and Melissa
6091.2,6096.16, and they're the most strangely competitive couple I've ever seen in my life. Really you guys are
6096.16,6101.6, into it they're like like I down the scores yeah I mean me and Sarah go play many golf for
6101.6,6105.84, it gonna take score you guys like you got your own score right. I'm like sharpening your pencil.
6105.84,6110.16, Yeah it's a score. The product is your stop that was a malligan. If you stop caring about
6110.16,6114.32, your scores and mini golf get to the point when you see that five-year-old kid who's
6114.32,6119.12, fucking running onto your whole when he shouldn't be a fucking parents need to rain him in
6119.12,6124.08, and he's just basically scooting the ball around with with the club. That's what happens to you
6124.08,6128.16, if you stop paying attention to your own mini golf by the fist hole they do you're gonna be that
6128.16,6132.08, good grown up and then it's like why don't you let's just fuck it pick your ball go down
6132.08,6136.8, the top and you go to a real golf course but because I don't have enough money and there's
6136.8,6142.4, not like a par three in the nearby. There is a difference. I was different. I would have
6142.4,6146.24, been through the years. I would gladly go. I do I do that golf but I need one of you to go with
6146.24,6149.84, me. Yes. I'm having a lot of golf. They have a really good golf. They have a really good golf
6149.84,6154.88, thing. They have a really good golf. That we've been to wait Sunnyvale. That's where we go usually.
6154.88,6158.72, That's not golf. Is that the one is it is it call like going to hear something? No that's
6158.8,6163.92, Castle Valley golf land. Golf land. Oh good arcade too. This place that we were going to
6163.92,6169.6, is like the most ridiculous. Like a world of golf. Well kept. It's a mini golf place I've ever seen.
6170.320000000001,6174.88, Like kind of creepy almost especially for it being in the Bay Area. Like you kind of expected to be
6174.88,6180.240000000001, trashed. What was all right? You know we were there last week. We were like yeah let's open a mini golf
6180.240000000001,6185.84, place and we'll have every whole tell of story. Yeah no and then our whole thing was like this is
6185.84,6191.68, basically the equivalent of like if we were to try to when when we wonder how we sound when we're
6191.68,6195.4400000000005, talking about games to other people or for their point of view it's us that when you do the
6195.4400000000005,6200.08, thought experiment you're like okay let's imagine if you were to turn a mini a midger golf course
6200.08,6204.08, into a narrative somehow. That's what it sounds like we talk about story to Sunnyvale doesn't know
6204.08,6209.12, about games. I think it's like you know Pac man stuff they're like sure. I actually thought that
6209.12,6214.16, thing that's a cool idea you should do that. Sure. I actually wrote a short story about that actually
6214.16,6219.599999999999, about a guy who opens up his own mini golf place. This is ultimate dream to tell the story of
6219.599999999999,6228.24, this Vietnam vet life. His life through a series of 18 mini golf holes. And the ball is like all
6228.24,6236.16, the going in all these traps. Yeah. Wow. You read that on the podcast next week. I have my own
6236.16,6241.68, uses for it. But that's great. That's awesome. What did you get? What was it called? I don't have a title
6241.76,6247.52, for you. It's actually for balls and other projects about that. Yeah. You can have balls. They carry that.
6247.52,6255.4400000000005, That is excellent. Okay. You can have them. I think that's like a good stand-in for just how
6255.4400000000005,6260.88, ridiculous sometimes it is to even think about like trying to tell a story with a game. Yeah. It's like
6260.88,6265.76, so much artifice such an unwieldy thing like you don't look at it and say you know what Pac
6265.76,6271.52, man would be so much better if it told a story. Don't I was thinking about that today when
6271.84,6278.320000000001, I was looking at Somedamiga for the way I was thinking watching other people play. I was able to do
6278.320000000001,6283.360000000001, something I never able to do when I'm playing a rhythm game which is look at the shit that's going on
6283.360000000001,6287.84, other than like the color lights I got a pay attention to to win the game. Yeah. And you know you look
6287.84,6290.88, around and they're oh wow there's like all these people dancing in the city. There's like some
6290.88,6296.64, whole little mini story going on here without all these people in the city having a festival or whatever.
6296.64,6300.88, But like who are they designing all that for? Depending on that time for people. All you
6300.88,6306.4800000000005, your other friend for your own catch smoke. Yeah. It's just like it was looking at the blue bubbles.
6306.4800000000005,6311.4400000000005, Think about this. It's John Davis supported out on what appears last week. It's like boom blocks.
6311.4400000000005,6316.56, Has got there's but if you don't hit the skip button it's trying to tell you a story about like
6316.56,6320.64, why these bears are attacked. It's trying to get a chance. It's trying to get a chance.
6320.64,6324.4800000000005, It's trying to get a chance. That's the period of what there is. There's someone on staff there who's
6324.48,6329.12, like this is the story they've always wanted to tell. Like this is their opportunity. Yeah.
6329.12,6334.959999999999, But really it doesn't fit because it's just about I don't care. These cows are saving this
6334.959999999999,6340.5599999999995, kingdom. I wrote the story when I was 10. Now what's going to be made public?
6342.24,6345.28, Yeah how did we get on this tangent one? I don't know the salt product.
6345.28,6349.599999999999, Yes. One tangent. It's kind of what it is. It's one long tangent.
6349.599999999999,6353.679999999999, Oh did anyone Jeff you picked it up I was going to William's pinball collection for we?
6353.68,6358.56, I did. Yeah it's nice. It's kind of cool how you hold a none truck and another thing and it's
6358.56,6362.8, like the flippers. It at least gives you the sense that your hands are spaced apart like they would be
6362.8,6366.400000000001, on a real-time ball machine and then you shake it for a little bit. That sounds good.
6366.400000000001,6370.96, And even the stick used to analog stick but you pull it back and it's not just like we're just
6370.96,6375.4400000000005, simply touching it guarantees. You can actually like fuck it up and not do it well enough.
6375.4400000000005,6378.96, Yeah. I need to explain what I'm talking about. Basically when you pull the plunger and
6378.96,6383.2, push the ball into the playing field. Right. He used the analog stick so you have to like pretty much
6383.2,6388.08, you have to snap it pretty clean otherwise you won't launch it through. The cameras like work really well on it.
6389.44,6392.4800000000005, Talk about a camera and a pinball game because I guess that's pretty much not important you know.
6392.4800000000005,6395.04, I mean it is important. We are playing our parents sort of game. Are they classic?
6395.04,6400.24, They're good. They should. They have a lot that you'll recognize from the pinball arcade we've
6400.24,6405.12, gone to in Alameda. It's like it's a gargar or something. It's like some stupid demonic thing. It
6405.12,6409.44, looks like they kind of tattoo like a metal head would have like 1981. Yeah. But they have that and
6409.44,6416.32, I like I like to prefer this stuff like you know fun house and whirlwind. Fantastic. And then fun house is
6416.32,6420.72, the shiitake. You know especially because these machines are another example of what we're just talking about.
6420.72,6425.68, Yeah. They all put on this artists of story. Yeah. Exactly. This is yeah. I don't know.
6425.68,6430.0, What bumper do I hit? I'm trying to remember what came up with the mini golf. I was like I have
6430.0,6434.08, there was something that like was on my mind that made me think about it because yesterday I was
6434.16,6437.36, thinking about our golf analogy and that's why I was playing the pinball games. Yeah.
6437.36,6440.88, And thinking about the artists in the way that they they really out the table. Like
6440.88,6445.36, but it were how we think there there's some pinball games you can play where there's like a real
6445.36,6450.8, like a sense of but again I can't ever get any of that unless I'm watching someone else play.
6450.8,6455.84, Yeah. I'm playing. I'm not seeing any of that. Well fun house has something like that. There's
6455.84,6461.76, that big mannequin head in the middle of the table on its eyes move and its mouth opens and stuff
6462.08,6466.08, and it's saying all this random shit. Sometimes he's angry with you and sometimes he's telling you to eat
6466.08,6473.04, have a hot dog and then you put him to sleep and when you put him to sleep his mouth opens
6473.04,6478.56, and you knock the ball and do his mouth you put the ball in his mouth and then he uh like he flips out
6479.04,6485.68, and he starts screaming and he shoots multi balls out. But there's some kind of a story to this
6485.68,6492.0, this fantasy. The truth is don't you. I think it's a game from the late 70s or early 80s.
6492.0,6496.64, Yeah. It's just some like drug-inspired nightmares. Someone has some of them are. You
6496.64,6501.04, will make a game with the ventriloquist to me. What's the amount of the
6501.04,6504.56, nannities? That's what our homework is to like go play a pinball game and like try to write
6504.56,6509.4400000000005, the story. What is it? That's great. The big the big problem with this thing knows that like
6509.4400000000005,6514.64, some of the my favorite pinball games can never will never appear in these collections because
6514.64,6519.04, although there were license for the longest time it was like like it was either twilight zone
6519.04,6524.08, or some random ashtht even like Harley Davidson and it was like yeah pinball machines became the
6524.08,6529.76, quilt of like what slot machines are now in casinos. It's like you go in and there's a Tabasco slot
6529.76,6534.4800000000005, machine like who's like you dad don't get him to spend their money. Hey I love Tabasco and
6534.4800000000005,6542.0, let me put yours in that. But yeah some of those like the Star Wars one and but it's got pin
6542.08,6549.12, baro go on. What is it about that? No the thing for me is that I any pinball game that I can play
6549.12,6554.48, on any video game system basically makes me happy because I just have that like childhood thing
6554.48,6560.08, and maybe you guys have it with with video games being a little younger than me but like because I
6560.08,6566.88, can never play enough because of the money limitations so I always was stressed out about pinball all the
6566.88,6572.56, time. I only had so many dollars I could spend that on my mom when in Gimmy anymore. Now it is so
6572.56,6579.4400000000005, every game was like fucking important. Yeah. I can like new game again. Yeah. Yeah we took for you.
6579.4400000000005,6583.68, Totally. Yeah. Did you mom? Yeah. Did you find in the same way that having a single nilla
6583.68,6588.400000000001, way for me the nilla way for good and daycare? Whereas if you had a bag you could have a bag
6588.400000000001,6592.96, just passed. It's just a long time to finish your return to the same way that yeah like it is
6593.44,6597.84, as much as I enjoyed on Wii it's never as fun as when I knew my dad gave me three quarters and
6597.84,6601.92, you go spend my one like because then you're like you actually care if the ball goes down the gutter.
6601.92,6607.68, I remember that that street fighter because I would take my lunch money I would skip lunch every day
6607.68,6614.16, come home eat like two bowls of cereal because that's a fatty and go to stop and go and spend my lunch
6614.16,6618.96, money on street fighter and it was like all right you know is it going to be over in 30 minutes or
6618.96,6623.04, am I going to get like two hours out of this and you know like the sky walks through that you know is a total
6623.04,6627.28, badass and you're like oh god damn it. We'll do all my money. It was like the double dragon kind of
6627.28,6630.8, games which you knew had a discrete ending but you knew you had three bucks or whatever. Oh yeah.
6630.8,6635.04, And like okay can I get past the before this time? I'm going to fuck it in here. Oh yeah.
6635.04,6640.08, Bobo. How does this move the fighter game thing with the with the equivalent of a
6640.08,6644.72, wager on it did you know it didn't crease the tension because it's not like you're just playing
6644.72,6648.16, for like your rap I mean you're actually you could you'd have to leave man you'd be out of my
6648.16,6652.24, other that or you'd be the Katie's stare pretending to play in the trackscreen until some
6652.24,6658.24, bigger kid comes by and ask you to fucking move. Now he was Jeff you should display it yourself
6658.24,6663.68, for my dad just recently bought a Superman pinball tape. Really? Yeah. It has it at his house. Nice. He's
6663.68,6668.0, playing the ball. He's high maintenance though. No. Changed rubber bands and
6668.0,6672.0, surprise doesn't have to get changed at often he took it to a guy that that's all he does. It's
6672.0,6676.08, fixes a little pinball tables. Wow. Adam fixed up the guy even read it all the Superman
6676.08,6681.28, artwork in it by hand. Oh my god. Do you think he ever tried to like tell your mom
6681.28,6688.08, that they needed to have sex on the machine? What the hell? That's a lot of man's
6688.08,6692.16, hill. My dad's thinking like how like I just imagine like someone's dad like a
6692.16,6696.5599999999995, hashian like pinball machine like garg on or whatever it was. It's not a lambard. He's like you know
6696.5599999999995,6704.32, what he's like you know when I was a teenager I always had this dream. Did I want to think
6704.5599999999995,6709.36, about the change you were conceived on that thing man. Those dreams are often displayed across
6709.36,6716.32, the table itself. I mean how many pinball machines have been like hard. That that
6716.32,6720.32, that element of pinball place just full of all these pinball machines from the 60s and 70s
6720.32,6724.719999999999, that's just a bikino hot day with like really gross looking painted faces. Don't
6724.719999999999,6728.88, be mad imagine if there was like a combination of like you know they have the beat up boost
6728.88,6733.28, at some porn places where it's just a video screen. What if you go into the little black closet
6733.36,6738.0, this is a pinball machine. You're close to door behind you and you play pinball.
6738.0,6744.639999999999, Right. What if John definitely need two hands to play pinball.
6744.639999999999,6750.639999999999, Wow that's why the net is a double flip or both left and right flipers control on the left
6750.639999999999,6755.44, side of the game or the right they did. In these boosts that I did I think you
6755.44,6758.48, I was actually picturing it being more like a regular pinball machine with the built-in
6758.5599999999995,6760.5599999999995, flesh life. Oh
6761.839999999999,6765.839999999999, for the coin slide. Oh
6765.839999999999,6771.2," Oh, I don't know. We've reached a new load. Yeah. Wow. Wow."
6771.2,6776.48," Well, you guys have played Earthshaker. That's now that's a pinball machine that"
6776.48,6779.919999999999, I really enjoyed. It sounds like the whirlwind series. It's based on
6779.919999999999,6784.879999999999, it's actually it's actually kind of like creepy in that it was made in the 80s and it's about
6784.88,6790.64, a giant California earthquake. I remember this. So the word like while you're playing you'll hit
6790.64,6795.36," something that'll make an earthquake happen and depending on like how powerful the earthquake was,"
6795.36,6799.28, it'll like mess a bunch of stuff up on the board and like you know it's kind of neat.
6799.28,6803.84," It's really, it sounds red and for those people the pierists who like the really old machines"
6803.84,6807.6, when there's nothing but there's like three bumpers. Yeah. It a bunch of fucking empty space and
6807.6,6813.36, like a pornographic picture underneath like I'm right in my hand. I like the late ones right before
6813.36,6819.04, like pinball industry just completely tanked where there were just ridiculously convoluted mouse traps
6819.04,6824.16, but for that reason it was interesting in a same way like any kind of bizarre in your house. I like that too
6824.16,6828.08, but it was the next step when they felt what they had to compete with the video game machines
6828.08,6833.04," and they had to when they lost it to me. Like Star Wars episode one. Yeah, and they started throwing"
6833.04,6838.08, you know digital shit in there. Yeah. No. Some of that was okay in mind. I'm not to me but
6838.08,6841.36, that's because that would be like there would be just like a really rudimentary midi game that would
6841.36,6846.0, happen on the LCD thing. Yeah. Yeah. Now and then I'm not a fighter battle. Because it was still
6846.0,6850.88, it wasn't like competing with the games. It was still so like hokey and the terror is like you.
6850.88,6856.32, So remember baby Pac-Man though? Where there's a pinball machine in the bottom and then what you got into
6856.32,6861.759999999999, it so you spate you wanted to do that. Yeah. That was kind of level that. Yeah. There was also
6861.759999999999,6866.4, a Terminator 2 had that thing where you could get the one like bonus section where like suddenly
6866.4,6873.44, you'd have to look up and on the really crappy low-fi LCD monocolor screen. He would use the gun to
6873.44,6880.24," shoot like Terminator robots. Yeah. I love his like that. Yeah. Dude, that reminds. No,"
6880.24,6884.639999999999, now we're just doing random memories but uh... didn't fucking. Remember like that came
6884.639999999999,6888.799999999999," operation wall from that whole like job row for arcade shooter and they had the term. Well,"
6888.799999999999,6892.799999999999, termin and then there was the era. What about the era Smith one? Did you guys talk about that?
6892.799999999999,6896.24, Yeah. That will let's talk about but let's just know that it's painful to
6896.24,6903.76, remember that reaction. I always love shooting games. I actually have total the bad acid
6903.76,6908.5599999999995, marksmanship shooting games. Like no one no one in this building can beat me at marksmanship shooting
6908.5599999999995,6912.96, games. What about the really old old ones where like they had like the haunted house theme one
6912.96,6917.679999999999," and it was like fucking oh, uh, beast buster beast busters that we were talking about."
6917.679999999999,6923.92," I mean, oh my god. It was like really stupid graphics and shit and they before that. Like when"
6923.92,6928.32, you go to the arcade expo. They had ones where they were almost like miniature shooting galleries.
6928.32,6931.76, Like the kind that you'll go like if you go to some family fun center and it's just basically a
6931.76,6936.24, like a thing but they would be like housed inside of a glass and it would actually be
6936.24,6940.24, people like a big way back there. So that's where they could have all this depth to it down there with that.
6940.24,6945.36," They're like a beast. For instance, you can shoot it was like a projector and it would just show"
6945.36,6951.76," some of the light on the street and you have to shoot that. That was awesome, man. That was really"
6952.56,6957.12, like not very forgiving. Like you would just try to shoot over it over again. It was really hard. You're like I'm
6957.12,6961.76," hanging out at that. Yeah, I never felt compelled to play that one. Did I really just criticize"
6961.76,6968.320000000001, skeet. Wow. Imagine if you're doing reviews back there like going to Chuck E. Cheese
6968.320000000001,6970.88, refueling those. I would have been a very different person.
6972.8,6978.0, It's part of their view of the cabinet art. You got a lot of cheeses exist. So there's not the same as it was.
6978.08,6981.2, And you're not a lot more serious now. It's all redemption. You're not allowed to go and
6981.2,6986.08, Chuck E. Cheese if you're over the age of like 15 and you don't have a child. Yeah.
6986.08,6992.32," Yeah, for younger listeners Chuck E. Cheese that you know, the Chuck E. Cheese is"
6992.32,6997.28, very younger listeners know now are like just the saddest shadow of what they used to be.
6997.28,7003.04, They wanted Elkahon San Diego that I went to as a kid was enormous. They would have like
7003.12,7009.5199999999995, the dining area was just a like you know auditorium size thing with the big animatronics show going on.
7009.5199999999995,7014.24, And then you would crawl in this mouse hole underneath that right underneath the stage. Go through
7014.24,7020.32, this like carpeted maze on the interior and behind the animatronics end up on some slide that
7020.32,7024.48, would take you down into you know some other areas and stuff. And then there was like games. That was
7024.48,7028.64, where to go when you wanted to see all the cutting edge games that would appear on that like TV
7028.64,7032.64," game show that they had way back in the day and you'd like oh shit, there's a game called crawl."
7032.8,7036.96, Based on it. There you go Chuck E. Cheese to find it. But Chuck E. Cheese now is all the
7036.96,7041.6, redemption shifts. Like can you drop a coin in here to get more coins out? My boyfriend used to work
7041.6,7047.280000000001, in the kitchen of an olive garden that overlooked a Chuck E. Cheese animatronic graveyard. So
7047.280000000001,7052.88," there's a lot of like they'd put Chuck E. Cheese is there and it's slowly over the days,"
7052.88,7056.72," watch the kid run off and then you'd have the skeleton underneath. Oh, that's awesome."
7056.72,7061.84, I'm sure that guy of the YouTube who makes the YouTube of his like showbears pizza on the
7061.84,7067.280000000001," maze. That's like a band like playing songs. Yeah, yeah. That's all this love and do it and"
7067.280000000001,7072.0, they're playing like nasty like hip hop club songs and shit. I would go see a live version of that like
7072.0,7077.12," if you toured the country out go see his animatronics. Yeah, I would go I would go see that band like I would"
7077.12,7080.96," pay 15 $20 to see that. You'd have to get blazed though. Oh, I would."
7080.96,7091.52," I would totally be there with you. Blazed means it was. Yes. Oh, you're okay. Yeah."
7091.52,7095.52, You're on the map with you. The Mac guy to this. That's the new link. That's the new link.
7095.52,7100.32, Yeah. I like to get really enthusiasm. Take the Christmas news or the kind of
7100.32,7105.12, caravan. I took some gatorade. Take your toboggan and
7105.12,7110.08, chuckie cheese back in the day that was like the place where you would just dream about going.
7110.08,7114.48, It's like you got to go like at least for me. I got to go like a couple times a year. Maybe yeah
7114.48,7121.04, report card day. Always brought. That was never. That was never a day. Maybe you're my dad.
7121.04,7124.64," It was a great toast. It was like yeah, your poor mom sit there. She's got to try to round up like one of"
7124.64,7130.24," your friends moms and they sit there and yeah, although I remember Chuckie cheese like the adults could order"
7130.24,7134.24," beer back in the day. Yeah, you could actually sit around and like have some pizza over here."
7134.32,7139.12, This is like good. Listen to Beatles songs played by electronic puppets. They had to fake ass Elvis
7139.12,7144.24, dog too. Yeah. Yeah. That was the other thing. They would have separate dining rooms dedicated
7144.24,7149.36, just to these these ones like the Elvis dog and then they had some other thing ahead of its own room.
7150.16,7154.32, You got to know like who who who were the mechanics working on these things all the time. You know that
7154.32,7160.24," Chuckie cheese, or is would have to have like you know a couple of three mechanics just working on all this stuff."
7160.24,7166.24," Leave their called Imagineers Imagineer. Oh, that's just me. There's also the place to go to play like the the laser"
7166.24,7174.0," disc games like I mean, it's a sit down or yeah, like the sit down versions of like red barren and stuff like you know"
7174.0,7181.76, Star Wars. Excellent. Yeah nostalgia on that. The past. Yeah things were better back then.
7182.48,7186.88, I remember when I used to be a kid and I wanted to work at a video game magazine.
7187.28,7189.28, What happened to your dream?
7193.68,7199.84, Stop there. That's it. We're done. It's time to get you. We've been here a long time. We we've podcasted a long time.
7199.84,7201.84, Yeah almost two hours over two hours.
7201.84,7208.0," Over two hours. I think we we've got through the first item on our agenda, which is to talk about the pre-3 stuff. Yeah."
7208.0,7213.6, Where are there any other items? We'll do them next week. Don't have time for items. Okay. We didn't even take a break.
7214.320000000001,7217.84, It was that fun. It was that fun. He feels like an hour and a half to have.
7217.84,7222.56, I got a P2. Okay. Wow. All right. Let's take it out on this ad. We this.
7222.56,7230.56, All right. Okay. The magazine and it's for Spectre Soft PC and Internet Monitoring software and it promises to record everything
7230.56,7237.52, your employees do on the internet down below. You got these guilty ass looking people. They look like bad people.
7237.52,7242.320000000001, There's like a white kid and he says he passes company secrets via the web Asian guy in the middle.
7242.32,7248.4, He serves porn websites from inside his cubicle and a woman and shops online after closing her office door.
7248.4,7252.48," Oh, but bad people. It was funny that they had more stereotypical."
7252.48,7259.44, That they had the the Asian dude surfing porn from his cubicle because the the will chamberland of
7259.44,7265.679999999999, Internet porn surfing was was just outed on the news cast last week and he had I forget the number.
7265.679999999999,7270.96, But he had it was like a hundred thousand porn clicks a day at his office or something.
7270.96,7275.92, It was just some inconceivable number where they had to actually break it down and see that it was just like
7275.92,7280.32," honoured in any given minute that he was clicking through. So on that note,"
7281.52,7288.32, we're out. Make sure you know what your company's employees are doing. They can be recorded as podcast.
