60.0,62.08, I'm done it's like like when I was like
62.24,65.2, Well actually I'm gonna make up a story because I wasn't in band in high school
65.2,68.8, What I'm not saying? I was when I was a trombone player in high school
68.8,74.68," I told me that I was number 36 trombone player. Yeah, that's the point where I realized I wasn't cut out for you right?"
74.76,81.66000000000001," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I was like I was like, you know number three trumpet player in band and number one and two those guys sucked"

87.52000000000001,91.52000000000001, And he couldn't solo for shit. And I'm like two seats behind and gone. Why am I here?
92.08000000000001,96.36000000000001, You guys and that's like what this is like I remember I tried playing the sax and like my music teacher was so pissed off
96.36000000000001,100.16000000000001, He actually I was in number three sax player and the music teacher was so pissed off
100.16000000000001,104.04, He actually grabbed the music stand and threw it across the room because I was such a crappy player
104.04,109.84, How many sax players and trumpet players have in your school? I know I think I like overestimated with my
112.24000000000001,114.24000000000001," Yeah, a lot of brass"
116.24000000000001,117.84, Bad it is
117.84,122.4, Retranots is number 18 and we're number 37 fucking retranots is 18
127.4,129.68, We kid the retranots we kid because we
134.04,139.67999999999998," In the kidding. Well, actually, I think no, it's just so though isn't it because like we dropped off for some weird reason like we fell off"
139.67999999999998,142.07999999999998, I'd tensed for you. I think our last couple episodes are on there
142.07999999999998,144.88," So that doesn't help so that's a actual, you know"
145.56,148.64," Technical difficulty sort of reason still, but we're still making them"
149.32,152.92, Who's now we gotta we gotta work we gotta work on this though. We gotta get up there
153.32,154.68, Who's number one?
154.68,157.92, Well number one. It's weird because they do it under like hobbies and games
158.72,163.78, As a general thing so number one is actually NPR's weight weight don't tell me which if you listen to that
163.78,167.95999999999998," Which is red, but it's it's a great show. It's a game show in the sense that it's"
168.6,172.51999999999998, That it's a yeah real fortunate to game show. I did actually is a game itself
173.04,176.92," You're listening to what's a sense of the game show not a gaming show, but"
177.44,182.27999999999997, Then I fit number two is X play but then three and four are our own one-up yours and
182.79999999999998,186.56, The one-up show so so that's good. I guess

230.55999999999997,232.56, Here's why we're number 37
232.88,234.88, We just talk about ourselves right?
236.16,240.07999999999998," We suck okay, but on the speaking of things that suck"
240.4,242.4, Hey
242.8,245.52, How about that windows vista launch it launching today?
246.24,251.60000000000002, Or yet tomorrow is yeah tomorrow officially tomorrow when this podcast goes up and I was noting that here
251.60000000000002,257.36, We are the official games for windows magazine and I don't know if anybody here is gonna upgrade
257.92,259.92, I'm not if I
260.32,262.32, Well
262.32,268.08000000000004, I'll happily upgrade the second I get it but I'll be honest. I did get a free one you did I did
268.08,270.08, I don't think
270.08,272.8, I'll be getting big I'll eat it. It's just like Halloween
273.35999999999996,276.32, So on the penny falls grandma like well with her spoon
276.88,279.76," I got a ton rap one yeah, I would be the first"
280.56,284.15999999999997, I trust the old Mary Jane down the street piece of the razor blade stick
284.15999999999997,289.12, I still eat it and then that's like my favorite swars were I still live in the neighborhood else which is eat theirs
291.76,295.68," Okay, you can have it because I'm afraid it's gonna break my machine. I think well"
295.76,300.96," I mean I have had it on my my test machines so I could do the vista like yeah, see if I had a free test machine"
300.96,303.28000000000003, I would do that but I would just got the one
304.32,307.12," Well, I mean I gotta tell you it's I've had"
307.6,308.96000000000004, I don't know sorry in that cone. It's just me
309.52,312.08, The reason I want to do is because I want to try
313.04,315.04, Flight sim okay X10
315.6,317.6," Yeah, yeah, okay"
318.56,323.12, I'm waiting wait until the first service pack right I mean like a lot of people are like you know
323.44,326.88, I'm getting a lot of questions asking me if if if they should upgrade straight away
326.88,330.32," I'm like you know, I just hang in there wait wait for like your night your for your next computer"
330.32,335.52," You're gonna buy yeah, come with vista on it right and I mean like right now people are buying their computers and upgrade"
335.52,338.72, I mean buying vista upgrading and it's
339.2,342.0, Like you see drivers like you see hardware and not much of the X10 stuff
342.32,345.92, The X-Heroy stuff out there right now except for the high end 80 800 boards
346.16,350.8, I see that's the thing I don't see any compelling reason to upgrade and the X10 games are now yet
350.88,355.2, So it's kind of rough right and actually one thing what's the DX 10 games out?
355.2,359.68, It's gonna be a no-brainer right now right now. Now. It's you're still playing games that are are
360.40000000000003,364.96000000000004, You know current for you but they're last gen by vista standards and so you're not getting quite the performance
364.96000000000004,367.92, Why do other than like jumping on slow and hype man wag right?
367.92,371.44, You know actually it's kind of interesting. There's I was checking through a number of different tech
371.44,374.64, I mean early test that I that I had done kind of confirm the fact that like
375.36,378.24, Some vista you know vista games are gonna perform a little slower than XP
378.56,383.44, But I'm actually finding like you know the drivers are getting a little more mature and while it's hardly
384.72,387.76, Hardly ready for prime time just yet some things like for example
388.88,391.36, Call of call of we sorry company heroes
392.8,394.8, Kind of water is
395.76,402.56, No company actually company a heroes for example is actually running a little faster and invest it in an X-T which is kind of interesting
403.12,407.28000000000003," Yeah, but it's just it's one of those things is you're gonna keep evolving and it's like not ready"
407.59999999999997,413.91999999999996," Fully yet. I mean they just they just released the drivers for the G for the 80 hundred's on Friday. Yes, yeah forget it"
414.55999999999995,419.84, I'm not doing it but and also I want I I noticed I noticed before and actually I just
420.08,425.76, Just before getting on the podcast some guys sent the synths around saying how a lot of casual games are broken inside of vista
425.76,428.96, I mean I was noticing this with casual games and also indieware and freeware
428.96,436.4, Why don't a few saying was broken as much as he was saying that like all the new security stuff was was adding like an extra
436.71999999999997,443.76, amount of hassle for those who are just trying to download stuff off the internet that the things that are being done for good security reasons are
444.08,447.44, actually creating these like barriers of entry to someone
448.23999999999995,452.15999999999997," Just trying to do a simple download. Yeah, so if you go to a gaming site like"
453.28,459.67999999999995, This is wild tangent that instead of just being able to click and download now you're getting like the 10 are you sure?
459.91999999999996,466.23999999999995, You sure you want to do that and that that's gonna cause some users who aren't a savvy to to be too scared to
466.71999999999997,468.96," Right, and then that's exactly like I kind of pointed that out"
469.44,476.15999999999997, When we did that early preview review and it's a simple matter of going into the user controls and basically just turning off of this feature
476.4,480.0, Which basically kind of leave technically would leave you more wide open but at the same point
481.03999999999996,485.91999999999996, I actually I remember complaining to the guys of Microsoft about this saying what if I could like
486.56,490.88, Instead of just having this binary on or off why could I just toggle it say okay for games? Let me
491.44,494.23999999999995," You know, give them the green light to go ahead and install stuff"
495.2,501.68, But I don't know I mean granted I have it you don't want that to come up every time you're trying to download a jpeg of say you know
504.08,506.24," Right, it some naked check, you know"
506.56,509.6, Please stop asking me from shirt double bag hurry
510.88,513.6, You know attempting to open you know she's gonna scan go
517.6,524.0600000000001, Please don't make please stop questioning me about it. You know keep asking me I'm gonna get all nervous all sights on a lemon
524.32,526.32, Parties the white and treating them like
529.04,533.2," Yeah, so I mean technically I have an extra machine so I'm willing to take that chance, but I"
533.92,538.16, Think that a little later on if people are like hesitant about upgrading straight away
538.48,541.28, Totally understandable no need no race. I'd say give me some
541.84,543.84, Now the other thing I want to bitch about is
543.84,548.24, You're ready to get copy by the way. You can have my copy. You can have it say yeah
548.24,552.5600000000001," Actually, I say you know for what it's worth I there are parts of it. I'm really digging especially because I'm a media center horse"
552.64,559.04, So like I'm really enjoying the multimedia functions on it. I've got media center on my Dell laptop that I bought and that's Windows XP
559.28,564.4," So what well, I mean it as it adds layers of functionality on top of it like I'm making my ears a function out"
564.4,566.4, Thank you for the marketing
566.4,571.1199999999999," All right, all right, so here's an example. They actually cuz I'm a stat tracker for like football and stuff like that"
571.1199999999999,574.0799999999999, So as you're watching sports it actually gives you sports feeds
574.0799999999999,577.5999999999999, We could track players and it'll tell you how many players per game and you know the stats at
578.0,581.5999999999999," So it's like you know hard core nerdy stuff, but at the same point it's like right there"
581.9200000000001,585.52, Take the advantage of what you can do with a PC law watching TV
586.24,589.36, I just have this fear of like loading that thing on and then you know
589.84,595.52," Whatever shit not loaded. Yeah, I don't know it's totally it's totally totally legit concern right now"
595.52,600.72, I mean like granted I threw some green some like you know games that I knew would not it's kind of like you know throwing a bomb in the room
600.72,604.08," Saying okay, what's gonna happen right? I tried I tried installing you know"
604.32,608.8000000000001, Might in Matt you know darkness eye and gothic three and stuff like that and in most
608.8,611.52, By installing dark messiah that's like asking for trouble
611.92,613.92, You got I wish like
614.16,620.7199999999999, Today I can take all risk with vista because the computer I'm gonna install it on it's already like forked and he's back
620.7199999999999,622.7199999999999," Yeah, and bag Nick here"
622.7199999999999,624.4799999999999, You get it running for me again
624.4799999999999,626.9599999999999, I just do it last time I took it home and
627.5999999999999,634.4799999999999," Played dark messiah for one evening in the next day it wouldn't load windows. Yeah, but that look like however much I played like four levels that night"
634.48,640.24, It actually really enjoyed the game and it ran perfectly so I have to step in now and I feel bad that like they did something
640.5600000000001,643.6, Happened and he was the same card too on that computer. I want to have here
643.9200000000001,647.84, But something happened on it they passed or what but it was running like perfectly in a knife
647.84,653.04, I was like holy shit. This game get a bad rap's the first like three or four levels were pretty cool
653.04,657.6," Yeah, I mean I actually I was enjoying it, but it's a kid. I can I figure out why it can like randomly breaking"
658.16,661.36, You can kick everyone you can kick your way to the entire game
661.36,665.04, It's like a stammie of stamina like you run out you kick yourself into
665.6800000000001,667.6800000000001, But you're asmatic attack
672.4,676.5600000000001, An all kicking game is kind of cool. I don't know kick it like kung fu
677.84,683.84, I'm just gonna rent about oh the 8800 that's what I was gonna write oh yeah because it's too freaking big
684.32,690.8000000000001," Who has a box big enough for that damn card is it it airing is it bigger than the 7-year-old? Oh, yeah"
691.04,693.4399999999999, It's I believe it's 10 and a half inches long
696.8,704.42, I'm not gonna tell you so I'm just 10 and a half into slow and it's too freaking so big and it's too thick too
704.42,709.76," By the way, it takes two slots. It has the girth of a catcher model. It's too long and too thick"
710.16,712.16," All right, we beat in that"
713.76,715.76, Number 38 this week

718.96,726.16, But all of that aside seriously. I mean I have a I have my case is not small my PC is not small
731.6,733.6," It's just too big for me, you know"
734.4,738.72, It's all about breathing and I contact I keep it right. I mean so

871.12,872.4, Reaver on that until you that
872.4,878.0799999999999, You're so right so okay go on
878.88,881.1999999999999, Because it wasn't like you know we just played
882.16,884.16, Ball stations midway and supreme commander
885.4399999999999,887.4399999999999, We have it on the list
888.0,894.16," Okay, so we're going in order of most popular things are least popular or just that we're measured out it's kind of like"
895.04,897.04, Leap frog between
897.4399999999999,902.0," But listen, okay some people are gonna care about man. Yeah, we're we're need even Vanguard right now"
903.04,904.8, Actually none of us have installed the yet
904.8,910.4, I don't we did I bring it up but none of us have anything to say about well I installed it until waiting for it to update and patch and all that stuff
910.4,919.4399999999999," Okay, I just think the timing is so freaking weird. I mean when I mean like when EQ2 launched it was right before well and here the next big launch for"
920.24,925.6, Sony is what right after burning crusade launches right but I mean we know why this is and it's really no big secret
925.6,928.0, I mean Brad McCoy talked about it on this digital
928.8,931.2, His own official site which is basically they
932.08,936.64," Needed the launch it, you know they were out of development money Sony told them you're done"
937.44,939.44, Launch this game and so they have
939.76,943.6, It's it's really not a secret. Do we think that they're not gonna wouldn't it help Sony
944.16,945.44, Remember their
945.44,948.72, Investment cost by being releasing it at a better time though
949.36,951.44," Yeah, I don't know honestly. I don't know what Sony's"
952.24,955.52, Financial stake in this is I mean that's just not going to
955.76,962.0, It's a weird time to be launching any MMO right right at burning crusade any at time
962.0,968.24, I mean hopefully they have to bank on a lot of players who never were either into wow of which obviously there are many
968.64,973.68," Or others who were turned off by that game because it's too accessible, you know these are the guys here"
975.04,977.04, It's too much fun
978.16,980.16, I need something less fun
980.9599999999999,982.56, I need to work for my leveling
982.56,986.16," Well, either that or the guy just shredded his disk on TV and said I'm gonna"
986.88,988.88, Kind of something else to play
988.88,994.64," Yeah, now are free associating yeah, that was a great video though you could do we have a link to it on our"
995.36,997.36," Yeah, yeah, yeah"
997.36,1001.52," Yeah, yeah, thanks tire banks show the tire bank. I didn't even know she has a doing an intervention"
1001.52,1007.12, But I guess she does had an intervention with the wow player because some of disgruntled housewife got on there and said that
1007.52,1009.68, All her her husband does is play wow
1010.4,1016.9599999999999," So I guess he was playing wow during her labor. Yeah, she was in labor. He went back for a couple hours to play the game and then go back to the hospital"
1017.76,1019.76, You know he might have been in an instance
1021.1999999999999,1023.6, He was a baby trying to feel it finished deadmind
1024.1599999999999,1026.56, Oh my how insensitive could that bitch be
1028.1599999999999,1032.24," Oh, yeah a baby the best thing about it. He's gonna be around for 18 years"
1033.04,1037.84, He's only got an hour to do deadmind. It takes the baby. You know 12 months to level. Did
1038.8,1041.4399999999998, I was wait I'll be there for the dings
1042.72,1044.72, First
1044.72,1049.6799999999998, The video on YouTube the best thing was like the dude who posted his description tag was like
1050.48,1053.1999999999998, Some some dumb shit complain. What were all the bark?
1055.6,1061.1999999999998, So funny those it was stay I mean they put on that music that someone like that's all right job is they make like sure
1061.1999999999998,1065.9199999999998, Trauma music music that's the lie during the fire bank segment and she's so mocked
1066.24,1070.8000000000002," Yeah, the the music that's playing over is like that you know it's like you would hear when register"
1070.8000000000002,1076.0," It's been for 10 years, you know it's got this sort of the wife is sitting behind him"
1076.0,1080.96, She's like the set of tyrosam the baby cries and he doesn't even he doesn't even you know turn away from the screen
1080.96,1085.1200000000001, It's like he knows you're sitting behind him squeezing the baby till it makes a little girl
1085.44,1087.44, All of a sudden he's like turn around
1088.96,1091.28, Look the baby's crying. She's like holding it upside down
1092.48,1094.48, Get away with that shit
1096.48,1099.28, You're trying to hear orders from my guilty
1101.8400000000001,1107.44, On the head so just be like swatting the table and screaming like you like your screaming
1109.44,1111.44, I told you to leave me alone when I play
1114.5600000000002,1117.04, That's what I'm done with this level
1118.0800000000002,1120.0800000000002, Your playing a game. It is pretty funny
1120.32,1127.04," Yeah, yeah, that was actually that was a very weird segment of that show because it just shows that like in because you"
1127.1999999999998,1132.24, It was clear that the people on the tire bank show including tire banks didn't even they didn't know what this game was
1132.8799999999999,1136.8799999999999, What it involved or whatever it just sounded like to them it just was as far off
1136.8799999999999,1140.1599999999999, I was like she just kept saying that's in that sense pretty intense though
1140.48,1144.32, That's pretty intense actually even scarier that show is intense like sin beds
1145.28,1147.9199999999998," sin bed head is show yeah, I missed that show"
1148.8,1151.76, How does she have a show too why she like giving out advice
1153.28,1155.28, Same reason we got a show
1156.8,1158.8, It's a pretty good point
1158.8,1160.8, You shake
1160.8,1162.8, Number 35
1164.48,1166.48," Okay, move it on"
1166.48,1171.4399999999998, That's it you have anything else to say about Vanguard to start I mean I mean this time it's a story
1171.92,1173.44, All jokes aside something that
1174.8,1182.16, We have to wait let's see what happens and there's definitely gonna be a follow-up story involved here and we're gonna be working on that like
1182.64,1188.0800000000002, You know almost immune to see what happens but it because it is it I mean so much of it seems written in advance
1188.0800000000002,1192.8, You know we can pretend you can call us bias but look at it look at the thing just the fact that we said
1193.2,1194.64, Wow burning crusade comes out
1194.64,1200.16, But what he's later you're gonna launch a new MMO that's hardware intent that's far more hardware intensive
1200.16,1202.72," You know, so that means it's gonna have a harder time hitting a critical mass"
1203.52,1205.52, The other fake just the fact that people play
1206.72,1211.44," MMOs and groups, you know, it's not like one person in your guilds gonna say hey guys, you know, I'll see it"
1211.44,1213.44, It was fun. I'm gonna be in Vanguard now
1213.76,1215.76," You know, I mean it takes it takes whole"
1216.24,1219.44, Groups of people moving you know these massive XMMO XS
1219.44,1224.16, There's just all these reasons that say this this game is not gonna be the kind of success
1224.64,1227.3600000000001, That maybe it deserves to be I don't know I'm played it
1228.08,1230.6399999999999," for whatever reason, it's just not it's a very ambitious game"
1230.6399999999999,1233.6399999999999, It is the the design for this is
1234.32,1240.1999999999998," Surias, you know, they're not messing around it's a hardcore game and some people are gonna dig on that you know"
1240.1999999999998,1245.06," They're gonna say like oh wow was like for MMO babies, and this is this is the real thing"
1245.5,1250.08, Well there was already one guy at the store was like waiting for the preorders like we were at Ebiggram's today
1250.08,1252.34, And there was a guy there waiting for van van for van
1252.34,1257.56," Yeah, because you know I said put him perspective I was the same way I mean in the office"
1257.56,1261.36, I would say before auto assault came out ago that game is gonna bomb so hard
1261.36,1263.8, And I wasn't like it wasn't like loading or anything
1263.8,1267.6999999999998, It was like in a suck cuz I was the one who played it and I was like this this would have been a fun game
1267.6999999999998,1270.32," I played it for two weeks, but it was sad because there was no one there"
1270.32,1275.1999999999998, It really it wasn't it got a popular way of perspective of the content of the game itself
1275.1999999999998,1279.9599999999998, It just didn't have a community didn't do well enough to have a community that that yeah kind of game ended up needing
1280.7,1287.06, My my unscientific prediction is that it will get a certain segment of MMO players
1287.06,1293.9, But these are gonna be hardcore PC gamers and specifically hardcore MMO players who've been waiting for something this series
1293.9,1299.94, But I think in no way are they just gonna get the mass of wild players who are looking for something new because
1300.94,1308.3400000000001, I don't see it being able to compete. Do you think would bite more into like S.A.E. is like you know ever quest players that it will like other MMOs
1308.34,1312.74," It seems like that would be the one that's yeah, so yes, I think at some point"
1313.62,1316.4599999999998, World of Warcraft's community will move on to something else
1316.82,1322.02, Most likely it would be it's the obvious that they would move on to another Blizzard product because it's right no see what they
1322.02,1324.26, That's just really move on to a harder core MMO
1324.26,1329.58," That's what I want to ask you. I mean you're saying it's hard core, but don't you have to be hardcore to play well on the first place or if you play well"
1329.58,1332.34, Aren't you hardcore? I mean how how casual of them?
1332.34,1336.02," I think you're only hard. You're in terms of your time commitment, right?"
1336.02,1338.02," You know, I don't think you're hard core in terms of"
1339.3799999999999,1346.02," Well, it's just how do you define hardcore most people play punishment average more than more than six hours a week, right?"
1346.74,1348.34, When you say I think it's fair
1348.34,1349.3," Yeah, that's fair"
1349.3,1354.3799999999999, I think there's a lot of people who play play a game more than six hours a week and don't consider themselves hardcore. Wow. It's an easy game
1354.3799999999999,1358.66," You know, I mean my daughter started playing that you know when it first came out. She was only 10"
1358.9,1362.5," You know, I mean it and there's people who only play wow"
1362.5,1367.42, You know play other games at all and part part of what had the reason it has a million subscribers
1367.42,1371.3, It's so accessible and they made it so accessible because they took
1371.98,1376.5, Existing MMOs at the time and they were moved every single thing that was hard and
1377.62,1378.98, You know
1378.98,1380.98, What's the word I'm looking for
1381.94,1387.54, prohibitive right about MMOs where as Vanguard is saying actually we like those prohibitive things
1388.42,1392.1," Wow, it's too easy. I was just wondering if you could not if you could have the"
1392.1,1398.1999999999998, Your cake you need to buy ramping it up by introducing it ultra accessible and then to keep people's interest because if it's too simple
1398.1999999999998,1400.6," So with the higher levels, you think it was interesting and again"
1400.6,1405.86, I think that that I would say that already exists a simple doesn't play that game because when you're telling me about these like
1406.54,1410.86," 60 man raids that take you out of entire day, right? I think not access no it exists"
1410.86,1416.58," And you're right your poop, but this time you get way up there you are a hardcore player. Yeah, you know Luke"
1416.58,1419.7199999999998, He's a hardcore player. He's a poop son when you hear he's a poop son
1419.96,1425.88, When you hear guys like him and and Damian over at EGM talking about their wild experiences or Sean the Lion around staff
1425.88,1429.3600000000001," These guys are hardcore players. Yeah, you know to to come to"
1430.44,1434.84, Seek in these raids you've got to know exactly what you're doing and it's not easy
1434.84,1437.72, But but that's the amazing thing about wow
1437.72,1442.64," It has room for those players, but then at the bottom end right got you know"
1442.64,1447.64, You definitely want to ease so one in I mean we can use that as our transition to move on to another game
1448.6000000000001,1450.6000000000001, Demo for
1450.6000000000001,1454.8400000000001, Balcations midway just get out Darren and I both played that actually I
1455.24,1459.0400000000002," Turns out I actually have the full game. Okay, I have the full game. So you go ego first"
1459.0400000000002,1465.42, We're curious what your experiences are so planning to play the multiplayer demo and let's get no tutorial and there's nothing to easy win to it
1466.72,1469.2," Yeah, that's like okay, what the hell's going on here?"
1469.2,1476.4," You're assuming at first you're like okay, there's gotta be layers of complex DM I'm missing because it hasn't taught me how to play and then we kept playing and I kept playing"
1476.4,1480.64, And I'm trying all these things the demo right right the simultipleir demo that's out now
1481.3600000000001,1485.1200000000001," Yeah, and then eventually I'm like I really don't think the really is"
1485.76,1489.96, Anything else to get I think this is basically just a console game that
1490.5600000000002,1492.5600000000002, They call a PC game
1492.5600000000002,1498.3200000000002," You know, they did whatever they had to do with the controls and it was just really simple and and ultimately dull game"
1498.3200000000002,1502.88," So you're you're impressions not high so far. No, I'll see what Darren is"
1502.88,1506.5600000000002, I'm sorry because I mean having spent the whole evening with it. I'm like well
1506.5600000000002,1509.3600000000001, I know I was excited for it like as of last week
1509.3600000000001,1512.3200000000002, I went this kind of the backfiring of a demo I went from hey
1512.3200000000002,1515.44, I can't wait this could be my next game to play for a couple months to like
1516.2800000000002,1521.9, You know about if I don't know what I have I have not played the demo so I can't even but it definitely sounds like they did it
1521.9,1524.0800000000002, Ask backwards because the single player game
1524.0800000000002,1527.6000000000001, I mean I just just started off with that and it kind of it does easy into the experience
1527.6,1532.32," And you start off it's Pearl Harbor and you're controlling a PT boat, right? And that's it and like there's no other like"
1532.8,1535.32, I think the thing is because it's because you have it's so wide open
1535.32,1539.1999999999998, You can control like a bunch of planes and boats and subs and have these all the different commands
1539.1999999999998,1540.8, And if they just throw you into multiplayer mode
1540.8,1545.86, It's almost like here's the sandbox you just here's like shit load a toys go for it
1545.86,1549.8, And then I'll really give it to the rest of you that's I think the most of the single could be a big deal because in multiplayer
1550.36,1552.54, As you say there there are a number of that you know
1552.54,1556.34, There's a navy there's an air force and you can take control any
1556.34,1560.1399999999999, Individual unit in the right of a battleship of a submarine of a bomber
1560.9399999999998,1566.0, But when you're playing there's no real point to you're not going to be any more effective controlling your plane
1566.28,1571.6999999999998, Then you would be if you just let the computer do it you could be a little more specific same what you take out at times
1571.86,1573.62, But it's not like you can take out you know
1573.62,1577.4199999999998, Individual due to walking around on the deck with carriers like that. It's kind of like do their thing
1577.4199999999998,1582.54," Well, I found that when I was playing when you're not I mean like you do jump between different units"
1582.54,1583.86, You can control a little later on
1583.86,1590.6, But it's the unit's play the AI takes more of a defensive role is opposed to an offensive role when you're not in command
1590.6,1592.62, But you can tell it like I mean I'd go to my key
1592.62,1597.3, You know to have go to my map and then tell my AI to play offensive right and you just kill them up
1597.3,1601.58, Say I want this air group to attack this carrier. I want some ring to attack the carrier
1601.58,1604.9799999999998, But it might be as effective. It might be it might take a little longer to sync a battleship or something
1604.9799999999998,1606.9799999999998, But you're right. I mean it's like it's a lot a lot
1606.9799999999998,1610.4599999999998, It's a weird hybrid of RTS and action
1610.9,1615.38," So if you're not I mean if you're not ready for it, it could you could you could go all crap? It's an action"
1615.38,1621.06, It's just seemed weak and both comes to me the RTS things seems super like bare bones like super
1621.06,1626.3," You know training wheels stuff there. Yeah, I wasn't like you're doing a fraction of the things that you could do in an RTS"
1626.3,1629.78, You know and then again the action was super dumb down so that the controls
1629.78,1632.06, I mean the planes basically fly themselves
1632.06,1637.3400000000001," I mean everything controls is just so so basic, you know and clearly made is what's weird?"
1637.34,1642.6599999999999, The interface isn't everything. I mean they could add layers of subtlety to with the mouse and keyboard that they didn't and it's
1642.6599999999999,1646.02, It's all console it was really hard to control with mouse and keyboard
1646.02,1649.06, I haven't had a plug in a next box 360 can show it on to make it play right
1649.06,1653.8999999999999, Which seems weird because that if you're making that is kind of your making game a world war two game about the
1654.22,1656.3, Pacific theater that's using you know ships and stuff
1656.3,1661.32, I want to say that that's necessarily I mean I say it makes a lot more sense to a PC market
1661.32,1667.22, Do the age of the average PC game player went also like how well that that sub genre of games has done
1667.48,1671.52, So many world war two games and you could put that you could put somebody more you put out on the C in a year
1671.52,1675.9199999999998, Then you can like console and get away with it and it seems like hey great idea for PC game
1675.9199999999998,1678.04, And I originally thought it was so
1678.04,1681.4399999999998, It made to it and actually I'm still I haven't gotten it far enough
1681.4399999999998,1684.6, And I'm only like maybe a mission or two in so I haven't really gotten the full flavor of it
1684.6,1689.2, So I'm still gonna like it's kind of what was it the half-hearted fist pump or
1689.2,1691.2, That's another game
1691.2,1694.16," But it's to be fair to Sean. I mean you're you're playing the demo, right?"
1694.16,1699.3600000000001, I'm playing it's gonna not be the first time that a lame demo has come out for a game that's turned out to actually be exactly
1699.3600000000001,1702.1200000000001, I think I think I think I might have just made a bad demo
1702.1200000000001,1708.16, But at the same time I think like say for example to 2142 demo was entirely indicative of how the game well sure right well
1708.16,1713.44, I mean in a multiplayer setting the demo just means one map right you and it's gonna be different
1713.96,1715.96, largely just cosmetically
1715.96,1720.0800000000002," You know, I might have a corsair instead of like a wildcat or something like that"
1720.4,1725.16, But I mean you've got a full map and you've got the game mechanics and all everything works and if that if on that level
1725.48,1727.8, If you're like pretty bored and you're like
1728.16,1732.48," We just started and see even rather than finishing a game, you know, we've just turned on let's start another one"
1732.48,1734.48," Well, I don't think you don't have the game ships tomorrow"
1734.48,1739.8200000000002," So we're gonna have we should have box copy, but you know really quickly and I just be a matter of seeing how well it really does play out"
1739.8200000000002,1742.8200000000002, I mean I'm curious right like you said single player. I mean I could you know
1742.82,1744.82," Hey, maybe this is perfect"
1744.82,1751.3," It's pretty good isn't it next week we'll see how it goes. I got it. Yeah, don't I'm talking like I said about the multiplayer demo and not"
1753.3,1758.8999999999999, Hunch is it would have to be pretty surprising for the multiplayer to be different than demo
1758.8999999999999,1761.54, So that's the point of a demo to give us a vertical slice
1761.54,1766.84," Yeah, well, okay, so when we come back next week let's remember battle station midway and Vanguard"
1766.84,1770.86," Hey, I'm getting into check also before before we go too far off the battle station midway top"
1770.86,1776.54," Yeah, wasn't there a game a Pacific storm Ryan does it sound familiar? There's a CDV game that came out was kind of like this"
1777.8799999999999,1782.9199999999998, I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't remember seeing the review on that one who had that one fairity remember
1782.9199999999998,1785.1599999999999, I don't recall all right
1785.1599999999999,1788.56, That's another thing to follow for the next episode because it's a similar kind of idea as
1788.9599999999998,1793.1999999999998, Balsik's a bit of stuff looks really cool. I'll say if you're in the sky and you know
1793.2,1798.1200000000001, Flex coming from all the ships and you just see it like you know shooting up at you other planes chasing you
1798.1200000000001,1802.14, Your gunners on the on the tail of your planer automatically firing away looks pretty cool
1802.14,1806.3," The detail yeah, I mean like you're like I was you know just drive around a P T boat and like you drop in depth"
1806.3,1808.2, Charges you see the barrels roll off for you
1808.2,1813.32, Where you see the gutters on the ships just kind of like each manning independent turret looking for a nearby target
1813.32,1820.76, Your ship you'll visibly start sinking and then you go you hit R on your keyboard and you go in and you change your crude over to toe to manage the flooding
1820.76,1825.92, If your ships on fire you can go in and those are the menus I was saying are clearly designed for console
1825.92,1830.92, So instead of just like why would you have to go to a submen you if you're controlling a ship and you've got a keyboard with all those keys
1830.92,1833.44, Just press a ball so I put my my my
1833.44,1834.8, Manpower on the other
1834.8,1838.1, I didn't get I didn't get that far there is a lot there are no hot keys for that
1838.64,1844.64, Maybe you could put them off for instead you open a big window very very console centric and then you move your mouse and you click on them
1844.64,1848.64, And you could tell it's all based on the controller layout and maybe they are off to go back into it
1848.64,1850.2, I'm we spent you know again
1850.2,1853.4, I think this is probably the curse of making a multiplayer demo without a proper tutorial
1853.4,1859.6000000000001," So yeah, that's a bad idea in general and I played I played the same one on the console I played the 360 demo as well"
1859.6000000000001,1863.2, And as exactly the same the game is identical when it was so weird
1863.2,1870.96, I mean not many people were playing it and it's like if you're going to introduce a new I mean if it doesn't have you make a death match game who cares don't waste your time
1871.2,1876.72," But in a game like this you know, it's like explain how so people can appreciate what's going on"
1876.72,1879.28," Yeah, totally the insects and frustration"
1879.92,1886.04, Mod that came out and it's like you just if you know the tutorials in a PDF form at least there is one there
1886.04,1891.44, And it's like but no one's gonna look at that you you need it with something interactive and they did when the hidden came out
1891.44,1894.96, That was great on their part as they did an interactive tutorial right
1897.04,1898.4, So
1898.4,1899.92, Mr. Elliot
1899.92,1902.56," Yeah, tell us about the things you saw that"
1903.44,1909.1399999999999, That your midway mr. Sean Elliott was it in the midway games whatever they called they had some kind of gamer day
1911.1399999999999,1915.24, You went to Vegas to check out some new games and you were happy that's a good general
1915.24,1919.6799999999998," Yes, with a lot of really cool stuff. I mean the big big standout for PC"
1919.6799999999998,1922.32, Obviously is Unreal term in three formerly known as
1922.96,1923.9199999999998, 2007
1923.9199999999998,1929.6, For that our next cover story by the way and so I played multiplayer in that the
1930.12,1936.1599999999999," Capture the flag with vehicles. It's a separate you know, they've separate all these different modes and so it works differently when you have vehicles"
1936.7199999999998,1938.1599999999999, Um
1938.1599999999999,1941.8, And that well that's not like sort of the big flagship mode on that was a whole lot of fun
1941.8,1944.08, The game looks great and if you played gears award
1944.08,1948.3799999999999," I mean definitely that level if not better, you know a lot more I mean"
1948.3799999999999,1950.1599999999999, This a lot a lot more a lot more a
1950.7199999999998,1953.86," You know a lot more flare, you know waterfalls and things like that that are pretty"
1953.86,1955.86, I can't you don't see and
1956.34,1959.6999999999998, The uniformly drab and you know dust it over here's award maps
1961.34,1965.78, Some of the battle to sort of like game you know give you some gameplay things that I like that I knew were good
1967.1399999999999,1971.62, One problem in that kind of game a scale we've talked about it all the time when it's like with a sort of game
1971.62,1974.5, It has to do with what happens when you don't have a vehicle?
1974.5,1978.4199999999998, I mean is the game gonna hold up when you're basically like taking the heel toe express
1978.86,1982.06, From your main base to then to the next firefight
1982.34,1986.56, So to fix that they throw you you get a hoverboard that you can use anytime you want and that was great
1986.56,1987.56, So just a kick flip
1987.56,1991.8799999999999, So that's a city in your inventory just in your inventory you go to it
1991.8799999999999,1997.6, But the trick is is that to keep it from turning into a game like you know tribes where everyone's got a jet pack or everyone's a hoverboard
1997.6,1999.6, You don't you can't use your weapons when you're on it and
2000.74,2007.3999999999999, Your hit when you're on it it throws you down and and it basically takes you a while to get back up and get your shit sorted out
2007.4,2012.88, So you're like like winded for a second and someone can someone like deliver a blow on your wire on the ground
2012.88,2015.1000000000001," Kind of win and they can yeah, and they can hit your game follow-ups"
2015.1000000000001,2018.2, So the thing is it's mobility and speed when you need to get somewhere
2018.2,2024.5600000000002, But when you don't think you're going to be fighting or a risk you want to take say you grab a flag and you want to get to hell out of there
2024.8400000000001,2029.64, You know then you can do it and you're risking like it will fit me knock me down on this thing
2029.64,2031.96, I'm gonna be laying there so that was
2032.2,2035.72, Really cool can you also go to get you on the back of somebody else's car and so yeah
2035.72,2041.9, You can hook up to someone else's vehicle classic problem another problem this type of game that goes along with the scope and the scales that
2042.32,2045.16, People don't want to I mean why do you want to be a taxi driver?
2045.16,2046.3600000000001, You get a vehicle like
2046.3600000000001,2052.6," Fuck off, I'm going to go drive out to the action and everyone's like need a ride need a ride need a ride and just keep it in F2 F2"
2052.6,2057.58, Negative negative negative negative negative in this case I should get a battlefield 1942 though
2057.58,2062.2, I would just drive around in the truck and then not pick people off with the horn hawk in order to talk to a boy
2062.2,2065.7, The little guy you got like that's like it like come on and then I would zoom off
2065.7,2069.46, You get the first to where I'm playing and you just like drive by people and tease them or like
2069.46,2073.16," Yeah, I'm just like in real life like you're in high school. You see someone like yes"
2073.16,2075.3599999999997," You don't see so many hitchhikers, but we've seen a bitch"
2075.3599999999997,2079.24," Fakers like you pull over and you're like, yeah, you know your friends in the side like come on come on"
2079.24,2082.4399999999996, And they start running and just like hard to horn and
2083.72,2085.0, I did right around a mile
2085.0,2085.96, Bangs
2085.96,2086.9199999999996, I take this shit kill
2086.92,2088.92, I'm going to do
2088.92,2094.12, You can hit them with like a sort of laser tether. It's kind of like a ski rope a dipsteths and a cheap power
2095.32,2098.96," That's cool. That was a layer might be you know, you can just get shot on that"
2098.96,2104.52, You know hit your right on it and if you want you can scroll up at the mouse wheel and pull yourself like you know
2104.52,2110.12, Into the vehicle you decrease the distance and the length of the rope and the laser rope until you're able to just hop right in the vehicle
2110.12,2116.28, If there's a passenger seat that was really cool the other thing that's fun about that is that you can
2116.76,2121.88, Use it as sort of like close line like our grow in a close line combined so if you
2122.28,2126.44, Swing out like you went on the wake of a boat on your on the back of a Jeep
2126.44,2128.6400000000003," Oh cool, so it's a little bit of a nice"
2128.6400000000003,2134.76, You know just cut their cut their head right off of Dave. I didn't see if you could duck if crouching is enough to get under that that would be pretty funny
2134.76,2137.2400000000002," That would be pretty cool. Yeah, because I know like they had the"
2137.76,2141.0800000000004, What was it right in in the T 2004 thing was called the mantis was like this like buggy
2141.0800000000004,2144.2000000000003, You know have these blades would extract from the sides the same principle
2144.2,2147.16," Yeah, same principle that we both that vehicle still in there too cool"
2147.72,2154.04," Yeah, and one thing that was cool and nothing so so the reason I was pointing out the hoverboard stuff is just their attention to"
2154.2799999999997,2158.56, The needs of that sort of in the flow of that sort of game and another example would be that
2158.8799999999997,2164.2799999999997, On the map that we played there are all these infantry only paths or very light vehicle only paths like the
2164.2799999999997,2169.9199999999996," There and what's the the necris speeder bike home the Viper the Viper. Yeah, so Viper can go through and"
2169.92,2174.7400000000002," People on foot, but you can get tanks through you can get jeeps through you definitely couldn't get like the dark walker"
2174.7400000000002,2181.4, So the giant necris tentacle monster. That's awesome. You couldn't get that in there and that was cool because again you don't want to be
2182.48,2185.6800000000003, The guy that's sitting there getting hit by the walker over and over again
2186.0,2190.14," And they have to find some some way about it, but I did I hear something really cool with those"
2190.14,2191.88, How you go for it? I did
2191.88,2194.08, Explo-and I do this every demo is funny back
2194.08,2199.52, I remember when like Star Wars Battlefront came out and at the demo there like the first thing I do is get like a scout walker and then school-based
2199.52,2203.4, For eight people because they never figure out that environment what you do to take down a vehicle
2203.4,2207.16, So I did it with the dark walker and this and I went over to the necris base
2207.16,2212.7, There was like there's a bunch of guys that write for other Mexicans and stuff there and I just would over and over again
2212.7,2214.94, They I figured out the three exit points from their main face
2216.44,2221.08, Duke of this turn them all to putting a second they would step out over and over again
2222.08,2227.62, The thing is is that that game is got is gonna have to have and I'm sure it was even in place in that bill
2227.62,2233.22, I can't imagine it wasn't but some weapon I mean I know you can get locked with regular rockets there other other varieties of
2234.22,2239.2, Of weapon like that will from UT 2004 was the big one this the stinger actually was something with an A
2239.74,2245.56," Why am I trying to blank right now? It wasn't axon, but it was something so but anyway, there's there's that and that would new come"
2245.56,2247.06, But like a jabbling kind of thing
2247.06,2253.7599999999998," Yeah, and then I mean so there has to be somebody it's like in that environment people don't know what it is and you just pour the vehicle and I can't know"
2253.76,2258.4, You know there was actually there something because I'm always talking about this. There's something really cool about that walker and that like
2258.4,2261.6800000000003, Let's see you're going up against a sheer mountain clip the tentacles kind of like
2262.1600000000003,2264.4, I'm sorry I'm making it as I'm sorry
2264.6800000000003,2268.48, Do you have the tentacles from the day walker or whatever?
2268.48,2273.6800000000003," Let me plant it like the tentacles into the side of a mountain's right you'll vertical climb. Yeah, I didn't see in"
2274.0800000000004,2280.6800000000003, Break up the geek term is like in a inverse kinematics for that when you're actually matching a football to the geometry
2280.68,2284.96, And I didn't see it. I saw that it was bluffing that to an extent that it was cool
2284.96,2290.06, I mean it wasn't like an exact you know application of but here's a football and then it's gonna apply the physics to this
2290.06,2293.68," Mall right and go but it look cool and it definitely works that way and that's all that matters, right?"
2293.68,2297.8799999999997," Right, so you could climb up mountains and stuff and it was funny because I would take this thing and"
2298.24,2303.4199999999996, Functions in a way a tank or a walker would but so much better than like the battlefield walker that's like you bump into a tree
2303.4199999999996,2306.2799999999997," Like oh the chicken walker like yeah, I go over anything"
2306.28,2309.76," It's just like yeah, then you're stuck there like marching in place and this thing can actually"
2310.1200000000003,2313.32, Do different things you can cross rivers with it and things that would stop
2313.32,2316.84, I mean exactly what if you would ever have such a ridiculous vehicle
2316.84,2318.84, I mean that would be the payoff for
2318.84,2323.2400000000002, Is some kind of mobility otherwise you just use trades right? That's right. I'll take it up to a mountain
2323.4,2327.6400000000003, And it was pretty funny because people aren't expecting to look up and see I mean they're getting hit by something
2327.6400000000003,2330.6400000000003," And coming from way to hell up, but they're not expecting it to be the equivalent of a tank"
2330.92,2334.0400000000004," That's on on this little peak, you know, so I'll do that right in front of their base"
2334.12,2336.7599999999998," That was part of how I yeah, I basically walk right up"
2337.4,2339.4, And sit on the top there
2339.4,2342.04, Now and it's got a cool another fun thing about that vehicles that
2342.44,2348.56, It technically can't the main gun can't traverse low enough and the end of other weakness that thing is the gun traverses super slow
2348.56,2351.08, And it but actually draws an arc as your you know
2351.08,2354.68, Is your shooting so you just see you know kind of trace trace of path across the terrain
2355.08,2358.08, But guys can get underneath you you can't hit them you can't do anything
2358.08,2362.8, But you have this all attack that sort of throws a shock wave out and we'll throw them on their ass
2362.8,2367.5600000000004, So if you get a whole bunch of guys like messing around beneath you you can at least like stun them for a second
2367.5600000000004,2368.92, With that and try to walk away
2368.92,2371.44, So some of that stuff was pretty fun. That was pretty cool
2371.44,2374.6400000000003, And I can't wait for the I know they didn't really they don't believe they showed it off there
2374.6400000000003,2379.0," But I can't wait to see the war for the war fair mode. Yeah, definitely one of the new mode"
2379.0,2382.6000000000004," I'm also the single player camp, which actually"
2383.32,2387.96, Shameless plug we talk about it in the new issue in the in the cover story
2387.96,2392.76," Which also not yeah, it's not out for a couple weeks another big notable difference we're coming on"
2392.8,2394.8, Is that they took out all the trick jumping in it
2395.36,2400.2400000000002," Double jumps and all that's it's kind of yeah, it's gonna freak out a lot of people especially because that was the way they played"
2400.2400000000002,2402.2400000000002," I mean, if that's all you"
2402.2400000000002,2408.1200000000003," You super hyper cadets all you did playing the other game, but it got to the point where you wouldn't know what killed you or how it is"
2408.1200000000003,2413.26, Because it would be a dude like triangle jumping over your head hitting you from above and stuff and they didn't want they wanted it
2413.26,2417.1200000000003, It sounds a quick speed what not that I'm playing that just having
2418.4,2420.1600000000003," Yeah, I would just log on it"
2420.16,2422.16, Ed
2422.16,2426.08," Okay, I'm gonna go play some I just wanted those cases where I think that's such a good"
2426.08,2430.3199999999997," I mean, I'm totally happy with that because it's still fast obviously it's not battlefield"
2430.3199999999997,2432.16, It's not like it doesn't have you know random
2432.72,2437.7599999999998," accuracy deterioration over distance and depending on the caliber weapon and in or any of that stuff, but"
2438.3999999999996,2445.2, It doesn't you don't have to trick jump your way the entire you need to enjoy it and that's cool because it's like any time team fortress
2445.2,2449.12, Whatever so if if you're in the presence of like good straight jumpers or whatever
2449.2799999999997,2454.16," You have to do it or you can't play with them right and I mean, so it's almost like make it accessible"
2454.16,2457.7599999999998," Everyone you know, I don't know. I mean, that's that's an age old argument"
2457.7599999999998,2462.56, But it's for better worst depending on who you are and what you want out of your your shooter
2463.12,2467.7599999999998, That stuff as far as I could see it is then there and I definitely like that Ryan do you have a play shooters?
2468.72,2473.9199999999996," No, I think the last one was battle field two, right? I think that's the last FPS I tried to play in"
2474.0,2478.08," I'm it it's not so much like shooters, but first person games"
2478.4,2481.52," What do they do like because of the yeah, I give you an honor to get the motion thing going"
2482.2400000000002,2486.0, I just can't get into first person games for whatever reason even a like him
2486.56,2492.56, Huh even a believe him and not even a believe him just wow so even so not even a non-action game
2492.7200000000003,2495.92, You just have a problem with that perspective as I would do this or more or less
2496.48,2498.16, But it's not like it's not like it makes you sick
2498.16,2501.12, It's just like you just have an issue with it. You just don't like playing those kind of games right?
2501.52,2507.2799999999997," I mean I don't about the on foot stuff you could play in third person in UT and pretty sure you can't all the vehicle. Yeah, that's third person"
2509.2,2511.2, The bet the closest I've ever gotten is a
2511.7599999999998,2513.7599999999998, The Metroid Prime game don't the game cube
2515.52,2518.96, But that's and even though it didn't come from you pain in spirit
2518.96,2520.3199999999997, See Japanese I mean obviously
2520.96,2522.96, Samus
2522.96,2526.4," It's kind of time you know, I mean it's the Metro series right"
2527.12,2531.04, You'll make a decision from that. I'm sure it but I didn't even get very far in those before I stop
2531.12,2533.2799999999997, I'm
2561.12,2563.12, 32004
2563.12,2568.48, Why they change it they can't they count though? I know that's the other it's like it's not I'm real turn them at three
2568.88,2572.4," Well, I guess technically they saw 2004 and 2003 is kind of like"
2573.2,2577.3599999999997, 2 number two I guess I don't know there was 99 2003 2004
2577.68,2582.16," Yeah, I know you know the naming convention bothers me period. I mean that would have changed unreal warfare and just left it at that"
2582.56,2585.8399999999997, There's a Xbox 360 there weren't 359
2587.44,2589.44, versions prior to week
2591.12,2593.12, Right
2593.12,2595.12, Fixed
2597.12,2599.12, You're gonna live with this suck it up
2601.12,2605.2," Actually how's strangled I'm a string oh, it's pretty cool. I mean it's"
2606.64,2608.64, He's got a massive key
2608.64,2614.7999999999997, Does it have anything at all to do with John well? I mean does it well? It's got the care I mean it's got
2615.7599999999998,2620.0, Filming and room with this name. It's got child infat started it in his his you know
2620.96,2624.32," Like I mean I did all the audio stuff for yeah, what does it make see are you?"
2624.32,2625.68, I guess my child yon
2625.68,2633.12, I mean John who is you know they showed clips of him in the studio and talking to their developers and he's supposed to be the wise sage
2633.12,2637.04, They're saying like hey this isn't what I would do or this is how you more don't
2637.04,2640.72, I want to increase the action you know 15%
2641.68,2644.8, But the game is really I mean he's looking at it they don't want me to say
2645.36,2647.52," Whatever, I don't it's like it's Max pain"
2647.52,2648.88," Well, that's paying three or four"
2648.88,2654.32, We don't back to Max pain stole it from hard boil hard boil just take it a back right right. I don't know if he I mean obviously
2654.32,2655.84, I mean I think like Max pain too
2655.84,2659.6800000000003, I'd really did some cool stuff with with narrative in there like that and maybe this you know
2659.6800000000003,2661.84, Maybe we'll get the work work that's work here
2661.84,2667.6000000000004, But it's really like you just take everything they you know made Max pain you know hyper kinetic went on just amplify it
2668.0800000000004,2670.0800000000004, It doesn't times
2670.08,2673.52, And those guys the guys making it did the the sci-fi game which was a lot of fun
2674.16,2677.2," Yeah, so they definitely got like I mean there's some of those those guys"
2677.2,2682.08, few features with that game I mean the story was just balls and they were all kinds of other issues
2682.08,2686.72," But well the physics made that game with that yeah, but just the buildy to like move through the environment and"
2686.72,2688.72, It's a story with balls. Yeah
2688.72,2693.7599999999998, We did we probably just have a force it's almost boss. It's a good bed and then I said think about it. Oh
2694.3199999999997,2696.72, An expert story is balls. It's good of course
2697.68,2699.68, No
2699.8399999999997,2701.8399999999997," No, no depends on me you're asking right so"
2702.7999999999997,2704.0, In my case it's bad
2704.0,2709.2," So yeah, but it's really cool. I mean no don't leave things I had you know, though we can start to have it's like"
2709.6,2713.6, How are you going to keep a game like this entertaining level after level?
2713.6,2717.2799999999997," Yeah, cause there's no cover system or anything like that and that's not important"
2717.2799999999997,2718.64, You know because
2718.64,2723.7599999999998, That's kindness for posties. This is the guy that runs around and shoots everyone is slow mo and then when that doesn't work
2723.7599999999998,2725.7599999999998, He makes it go even slower and
2726.32,2728.6400000000003, Then they call that they trade mark another name for that
2728.6400000000003,2732.2400000000002, He'll tell right and they introduce you there's the tequila bomb and there's all you know
2732.2400000000002,2735.0400000000004, Actually please after this weekend. No tequila bombs no
2737.44,2740.1600000000003, But the thing is is you know if that's the case
2741.1200000000003,2744.88, And you have all these ways of ripping people up in slow motion
2744.88,2749.28, You know you could trigger slow motion by doing a dive by falling over sideways like Max Payne would you know
2750.6400000000003,2754.5600000000004, You can all these other like you just trigger some one of the one of the tequila
2754.64,2762.32, Bombs is you just all of a sudden almost freeze time you click it you point on someone wherever you want to hit them shoot and then it's like you see the individual bullet come out of your gun
2762.72,2765.2, You know hit them in this basically you know
2766.64,2770.96," Oh, it'd be money shot of you know of a graphic violence and then"
2771.92,2773.92, Start tying that up and go on to the next one
2773.92,2776.48," So basically the game is like three hours long, but you with all this slow motion"
2776.48,2777.52, Right tends to fute you know
2777.52,2781.7599999999998, It's like all I could see is that they just throw more and more enemies that you are make them more lethal
2782.0800000000004,2785.76, So you have to defeat be that much faster at shooting them or whatever
2785.76,2789.28, I mean because when you're dodging bullets it doesn't which doesn't work that way
2789.28,2794.2400000000002, I mean where you're not I didn't see so much like you know where you're using the slow-mo to dodge bullets
2794.2400000000002,2797.76, It's just to help you hit more people in the moment but so I'm curious
2798.6400000000003,2800.48, Oh my definitely it doesn't seem like a fun game
2800.48,2806.32, I want it I do want to see there without unless it's like narrative and a good variety of levels and I think that is there because they showed you know
2806.32,2810.4, We've seen you know some of the Chinatown outdoor levels and stuff from then they showed inside the
2810.4,2814.48, Natural History Museum and you're walking up the backs of dinosaur bones and stuff like that
2814.88,2817.2000000000003, So those are ways that they could keep it interesting throughout
2818.0,2821.6, Actually sounds kind of good to me. I'm actually the bottom of it. I'll definitely up to Mr. Goodman
2822.1600000000003,2826.4, Hopefully be what was the quote again at Robert head for a ballet of
2826.96,2828.1600000000003, Blood and death
2828.1600000000003,2829.92, That the one where he ended up on the box
2829.92,2831.36," Yeah, that's something else"
2831.36,2835.12," That was the one Max Max Pane 2. Yeah, all right Max Pane 2"
2835.6,2836.96, Poledic belly of death
2837.28,2839.28, And they had
2839.28,2841.28, I didn't get to play it but
2841.28,2843.04, Blacksite there you fit there one
2843.6,2845.6, Which has got a Harvey Smith
2845.92,2851.68, Who worked on the dance ex games with Warren Spectre and he actually got hit a start in the business as a tester for
2852.08,2856.16, System shock one is on it and it was an interesting pairing because when you think of
2857.28,2859.28, You know air 51 think of tavern furniture
2859.52,2864.2400000000002, Is this like now 50% more resistant to cigarette burns or whatever you know
2864.56,2870.72, I think it like every every bar of bendy is got exactly when they get the orange gun and Max will force it digitized
2870.72,2872.8799999999997, Dude's coming out like making minimum wage like
2873.52,2874.72, And Halloween costs
2874.72,2879.4399999999996," With a rubber rubber mask over and said pop it out. Yeah, you can imagine like oh a bull directing him like"
2881.04,2883.04, Oh
2883.04,2885.04, That's his next movie
2885.04,2887.04, He shouldn't make one of that
2887.04,2891.04, I think actually just go to the title for so you know in light of those origins and
2891.6,2896.4," Harvest with pretty like down earth guy everyone I gather and and he'll say like yeah, I mean I"
2897.2,2899.2799999999997, Like it's important. I've never done like I mean
2899.2799999999997,2901.44, It's not like I'm a boh having a joke or a good time
2901.44,2906.4, But he's never his response with this is interesting. It's not like okay. Let's be happy with this and say
2906.72,2908.72, Unless just run with these like
2908.96,2910.72," Like shady tavern origins, you know"
2910.72,2917.68, He wants to make something serious out of it and in the way that like that he did with the DSX stuff and um I think
2918.3999999999996,2921.12, Well he talks a good game and the game looks like good
2921.52,2925.12, But it remains to be seen you have to play more and see how did you play the last game the
2925.12,2926.16, Orgian? I did
2926.16,2928.96," Yeah, he didn't have anything to do that one. I played the last one. It was decent game"
2930.16,2932.96, It also went for that kind of like a kind of ignored its roots
2933.3599999999997,2936.24, Except for like in the very beginning there's actually an area where you want machines somewhere
2936.3199999999997,2938.0, That one was full of in jokes though
2938.0,2943.7599999999998, But I was like totally can't be though right but the difference is in that game say for example you
2943.84,2946.2400000000002, I mean it was like art bell
2946.2400000000002,2950.2400000000002," Yeah, yeah, but I mean you run into a level and it is basically a stage for a thing"
2950.2400000000002,2952.48, Like that's exactly what I was gonna write for me
2952.48,2958.88, It's supposed to be like her you know and but in this one it's like I mean the term comes from you know black side like
2959.6000000000004,2960.48, Black I mean
2960.48,2966.1600000000003, It will be a chill like in our place where you you'd extra write prisoners for you know on a fish trial and this and that and so
2966.1600000000003,2969.28, Me the part of the game set in our act which is interesting a lot of war games
2969.92,2974.6400000000003," They're flat out, you know that that's what they do is contemporary like conflict won't dare to go there"
2974.6400000000003,2978.4, They'll they'll say okay this set in the Zika standard bullshit a standard something like that
2978.96,2982.7200000000003," And they always do that you know, I mean Zika standards actually right from full-specimeur"
2983.28,2984.5600000000004, And it's sequel
2984.5600000000004,2989.28," I'm crossing the road so for this game of all games to say hey, we're we're going into Iraq"
2989.28,2993.92," It's not like the first go for it's right now, you know and and I mean hey, it could be a train ride"
2993.92,2998.88, You start mixing some serious stuff in that with with the dudes in the latex costumes and that could be a recipe for
2999.6,3008.8," For disaster, but we'll see it and I can say the guy talks a good game and part of his ideas to to go for you know the philosophy behind old the old"
3010.2400000000002,3015.04," You know 50s post war horror movies where you'd say hey, let's take our our fears of you know"
3015.04,3019.76, Tonic weapons and have you know giant bugs and whatever or the commies next door and you have body snatchers and stuff
3019.76,3021.76, Saying what what's the equivalent for our time?
3021.76,3023.76, What is it that we're worried about now and
3024.7200000000003,3028.5600000000004, What do we you know what are big fears and how can we translate them into something that's
3029.1200000000003,3033.92, Something as goofy as like a big monster flicker something but it's still gonna it's still resonates in some way
3033.92,3035.2000000000003, I mean the fear is really
3035.2000000000003,3038.2400000000002," It's a mere manifestation of it is this hokey, you know"
3039.0400000000004,3041.0400000000004, So cool stuff there
3041.0400000000004,3047.28, I wouldn't spend more time making fun of it. They were they revealed the game called the I just got a system about the names called our victory and it's
3048.1600000000003,3051.92, Exclusive to 360 it's another it's a world war two metal of duty
3053.28,3055.92, Victor it's like that it's like that kind of thing
3055.92,3060.4, It was because we did a defeat on our side right so they flip the script say who wants to lose?
3060.8,3062.8, Where can I make great
3062.8,3066.2400000000002," And then you say well, day that's not specific we can give now or"
3066.7200000000003,3070.32, It's like the next game is like we're getting to the point where we're making fun of what we're talking about like
3071.44,3073.44, Minute of cautious optimism
3073.76,3075.44, We're not
3075.44,3077.44, Second of second of this pumping
3078.48,3080.48, Second of half heart and fist bump
3082.48,3084.48, Grounded this copy
3084.48,3092.96, You're really right that that probably was a marketing meeting that you think no sure I didn't say of defeat do well other other names have been like duty of publisher
3095.12,3097.12, Be pretty harsh
3097.12,3102.08, Hope principal that game just it just throws like quickly because I have been it's just so I'm not seeing this you know
3102.3199999999997,3107.44, Being human consistent I've defended world war two shooters plenty and this was the one I think
3108.16,3109.3599999999997, That that
3109.3599999999997,3117.2799999999997, Pushing me over the edge because when they were showing it the whole premise is that three dudes win the entire war right at least in the European theater
3117.8399999999997,3123.2, Three American dudes and one of course a sniper and he specializes in sniping and stealth and
3123.7599999999998,3126.3999999999996," Actually, no, he doesn't even step specialized in stealth"
3126.3999999999996,3131.2, He specializes in sniping and climbing so he can like get up to where he can snipe another
3131.52,3135.8399999999997, Specializes in stealth and so he can like kind of sneak up into a knife kill on someone
3136.16,3140.7999999999997, Which is really weird these example video you'll see on game videos is you step someone right in the back
3140.7999999999997,3144.08," I mean, I'm not like a special you know operative, so maybe that's a great way"
3144.08,3148.08," Maybe you sit them through the heart of back, but it seems to me like the steps on in the bottle"
3148.08,3150.08, They'd make like less noise
3150.08,3151.3599999999997, You know
3151.36,3153.36, Did you still
3156.4,3164.0, There's a quote over to see the running on plus an image yeah third dude though is stamina like that the thing that sets them apart and I guess those laughing is because
3164.8,3167.92, The trailer establishing all this is just dead serious
3167.92,3173.04, You know it's like this old black and white film in this like high school acting dude like sitting there smoking to cigarette
3173.04,3176.8, It's got his helmet on tammalies right in like right in letters supreme commander whatever
3176.8,3181.28, He's like and this third guy is gonna help us so he's gonna win this war for us
3181.36,3183.36, Like he has got stamina
3183.36,3187.1200000000003, It's all like just stamina guy he can go like this dude can run
3188.4,3190.4, The big in last you know what you want
3190.4,3193.76," Yes, okay, so basically we got the sniper a Whitman and"
3194.7200000000003,3200.96," Okay, so but it feels like okay in any other game don't you you could do all this when you want right if you want a sneak"
3200.96,3205.44, You could do it to the extent if you want to snipe you just drop your car and I need it
3205.44,3210.0, Whatever it was and all from the Nazis and you used your you know you put a scope on it or something
3210.56,3211.92, Um
3211.92,3213.92, You can all almost everyone can run so
3215.04,3220.08," That kind of renders I can less special unless he's got some like Steve Rogers, you know Captain America level"
3220.72,3222.08, Super soon I still have
3222.8,3226.64, He shoved his shield to everyone so it just seems so ridiculous and you know and you're like well
3227.92,3228.88, Okay
3228.88,3232.24, Like maybe that maybe this was it maybe this is too much world war to you know
3234.24,3236.24, You lasted about 20 games longer than I did
3236.8799999999997,3242.4799999999996, You just what you describe what the game you described is basically what I'd try to do in a year ago with the
3243.2,3247.2799999999997, Commando strike force right I mean that's that's the game. There's a there's the
3248.0,3250.0, They didn't have Dr. Stamina
3250.0,3253.68, You're right you're right there was the spy the stealthy Mickey Mcshooty
3256.08,3260.8799999999997, And Mr. Stamina was the I got the knife the thing is the reason why I usually do defend
3261.36,3265.2000000000003, These types of games is like say if you're like brothers norms and rainy pitchfords the guy
3265.2000000000003,3272.1600000000003, Associated with that producer the lead lead designer and when he comes out and says hey I've been a fan of this subject matter for ever just like
3272.6400000000003,3274.6400000000003, What's this name
3275.2000000000003,3280.1600000000003, Olaf like everyone the ill-stermative series and with guy you spent his entire life just completely
3280.4,3285.52, Fixated on that subject matter like like that guy wish I mean if he could go back in time and risk his life
3285.52,3290.4," I find him and he says he would know whatever, but that's how serious the guy is about that and same thing with Randy"
3290.4,3296.08, He really really likes he just idolizes the veterans that he knows me so that he's worked with and you say okay
3296.08,3303.52," This guy's behind this you know this is just game is gonna be profitable, but it's the result of a true passion that someone has"
3303.68,3307.7599999999998," But I wonder like when I hear about Stamina guy, I don't necessarily see that passion right away"
3307.7599999999998,3310.64, So we fair and have to interview him and I didn't get the chance
3310.64,3313.2799999999997, I mean I wasn't looking and there's it was just huge lines everywhere
3313.2799999999997,3316.96, It was a big assembly line of interviews and stuff there
3317.52,3319.52, Behind midway banners and stuff
3319.52,3323.7599999999998," Yeah, I remember seeing I do remember getting a sneak peek at that game at 83 and I was like you know guys"
3323.7599999999998,3328.4," I see where you guys are trying to go, but like I you know I gave a list of things that"
3328.4,3332.24, Correct different directions and you can feel the difference you know like when when brothers
3332.24,3335.68, Normos was unable then you look at like the way that the squad are working the fire team
3335.9199999999996,3340.3999999999996, Salteam the way that that always coming together the way that it was like all right instead of you know
3340.8799999999997,3344.56, Giving you off or or the norm the invasion
3345.44,3351.16, We're gonna it's all gonna take place in current hand over the course of eight days and we're gonna do I mean you can see look at that
3351.16,3354.08," You're like okay, like this guy this is for real this guys are about it. You know"
3354.08,3355.2799999999997," Yeah, I can't wait for hell's time"
3355.2799999999997,3361.12, I just didn't get that sense at any point watching that it just totally seemed like someone had a focus group and it some kid was like
3361.8399999999997,3363.8399999999997, I like Stamina man
3365.68,3367.68, I don't know he can super jump and yeah
3368.8799999999997,3375.48," So Darren you've been playing some spring commander. Well, I should qualify this by saying that this weekend was kind of lost in a haze"
3375.48,3377.8799999999997, I did play some Supreme Commander yesterday with a hangover
3377.8799999999997,3381.3599999999997, So my advice to everyone if you're ever gonna drink something called on-gapé
3381.3599999999997,3383.3599999999997, That seems like a bad game for hangover
3383.3599999999997,3385.6, Really a lot to focus on yeah
3385.6,3388.6, There's a lot of theaters and we're going on if you're in it. Yeah
3389.2,3392.3199999999997," No, but I was trying to control you realize you're trying to control the enemies you"
3392.32,3397.36, But but I swear that I wanted to try yesterday so I plugged in and I had my dual monitor set up and
3398.1600000000003,3400.1600000000003," Actually, it worked"
3400.7200000000003,3403.1200000000003, It worked really well. I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
3403.6000000000004,3407.52, Let me wait for next week when I can actually really get into it. I always though. I was only like one or two missions
3407.52,3414.84," You're reviewing this game. I don't actually pack my stuff. Okay, but we have it in for review Supreme Commander. Yeah, yeah, it looks great and"
3415.92,3419.1600000000003, There's only one thing I noticed so far so good minor thing but still kind of annoyed me
3419.3199999999997,3423.64," Was okay, so yeah for the for the five people that actually have two monitors to play the game"
3423.7999999999997,3426.2," So yeah, you have I mean, it's actually really cool"
3426.2,3428.7999999999997, You can scroll in and out like on the fly between the two different monitors
3428.7999999999997,3431.7599999999998, So you can have like a world view on one and zip down or you can have it on the other
3432.2799999999997,3435.44, But on one on the one screen you can only issue some commands
3435.44,3441.6, It's kind of weird like so let's say I'm on the right side on the right screen and I highlight some troops and I want them to pick over a base or you know
3441.6,3442.92, You know kind of convert a structure
3442.92,3447.0, I can't do it. It has to be on the left map on the on the left screen
3447.0,3452.02, It's kind of a weird thing and I maybe I think to get deeper into it or something about two monitors though
3452.02,3457.24, That's I know that is way to dilute the Crystal shy of going down to rain you a check to get the parts to be
3457.24,3459.6, You know what I really feel you're on hyper dry
3460.6,3464.92, And you know that was the ultimate list missed test for my my fiance if she actually puts up with that crap
3464.92,3466.68, She'll put up with anything so yeah
3466.68,3472.48, You know we were at this game through and as a vent last week where they were showing off that they were they were show prices which look
3472.72,3479.46," Freaking unbelievable, but they were showing supreme commander with with dual monitor support and I feel like every time we've seen a demo of this game"
3479.46,3484.36, Which I am very much looking forward to I'm an artist fan of a fan of I was fan of total annihilation
3484.36,3487.16," So I want to place a premium commander, but I have found it odd"
3487.6,3493.56, Every time they demo this game they show it on the dual monitor thing. It's like right who are you demoing before?
3493.56,3497.68," Oh, I'm opening through it. There's no this is so absurd. None of us have that"
3497.9199999999996,3504.0, E3 Sony showing like a hundred picture and pictures screens or they're showing like right and remonators hooked up
3504.0,3506.08, It's like what's your right and then supposed to be
3506.48,3508.48," Go, EG"
3508.48,3514.48, When they're like when I was getting some pretty commander demo the guy kept like pointing out the things that were cool about the dual monitor
3514.48,3516.48, I'm like well great for you
3516.48,3520.6," I can't do that. Yeah, my much my wife my girlfriend is not let me put another monitor"
3521.3199999999997,3522.8399999999997," Yeah, tell me what I can do"
3523.08,3524.6800000000003," Right, that's the board court"
3525.6800000000003,3529.44," You know what I'm a great salesman them what can I say, but I know but actually like that was"
3530.52,3532.52," Exactly, I say"
3532.52,3536.4, What I like when I told those guys I told I was talking to Chris tell him about this like dude
3536.4,3539.1200000000003, You gotta have I mean if I can't get that same experience while one screen
3539.1200000000003,3542.56, It's gonna be lost and a lot of people and then like on the flip of a switch
3543.2000000000003,3544.2000000000003, To here
3544.2000000000003,3547.1200000000003, We had it let's just flip screen it so I saw that and that was cool
3547.1200000000003,3549.84, So you can now do a split screen on a single monitor
3549.84,3555.36, So you can get that dual monitor thing on your right so me that actually that actually totally diffuses the argument of like man
3555.36,3558.1200000000003," You're getting ripped off that's then they still choose shit though, isn't it?"
3559.4,3561.4, Every time I see a thing the ankle and he
3561.96,3562.96," No, like"
3562.96,3566.6400000000003," Yeah, you have to have that ankle and he's really definitely the world view because it definitely it definitely helps"
3566.6400000000003,3572.08, But if you split screen it then you can focus on the action on one part. How does that game work when when there is that many units?
3572.08,3574.8, I mean obviously I can't micro that them well
3574.8,3578.0, Throw them all together and if you got better numbers and better units
3578.0,3579.1200000000003, I'd see them all
3579.1200000000003,3582.6000000000004," Well, that's kind of what it would a lot of like a lot of RTS games to fall to"
3582.6000000000004,3587.1600000000003," Right, there's a lot of this a lot of micro management from a top level and one thing it's kind of cool"
3587.1600000000003,3590.1600000000003, I mean basically if you know the command structure you can sit there and just go
3590.1600000000003,3594.44," Okay, I want you to build this this this and this you can like command you can you can in the very from the very beginning of the game"
3594.6000000000004,3597.8, You can lay out exactly everything you want to have it for the entire course of the game
3597.8,3599.8, And then you just kind of like modify stuff as you go
3600.2400000000002,3602.6400000000003, So the thing is you're not telling them okay
3603.04,3604.7200000000003, it's like
3604.8399999999997,3609.48," Let's okay, let's say you have like an engineering unit and it's not gonna sit. It's not gonna go. Okay"
3609.48,3611.48, I just mind the or now what you all made it do
3612.16,3614.64, You can actually like it's not gonna wait for that command
3614.64,3620.3999999999996, You can actually just stack up everything and just kind of let the computer do all the micro management crap
3620.3999999999996,3624.18, And then you can sit there and like worry about coming into the troops which I think's kind of cool
3624.18,3626.16," Yeah, that's the thing I mean because I'm"
3626.3999999999996,3630.0, But he can get the guy that and played on the instance company here. We'll go back and do it
3630.0,3633.08," Yeah, I got a problem with a million unit games"
3633.08,3638.4, I do much better now in my go-ditch in the smaller like company heroes
3638.4,3644.7999999999997, Because I find it any game like Supreme Commander or any of these RTSs no matter how
3645.44,3648.44, Complex they talk about the rules set or you know
3648.88,3654.2, The unit balance or whatever to me it always devals into I'm just clicking as fast as I can
3654.2,3656.72, I'm hanging you in the button and then I'm lasting them all
3657.72,3659.22," Yeah, yeah"
3659.22,3661.4," Exactly, I stopped looking at the unit this right"
3663.08,3671.0," That's what I hate that that's totally turned me off to the job. Yeah, and I was gonna say that this kind of that Supreme Commander in that case is the exact opposite"
3671.0,3675.4, Of where company heroes is because it fight that's awesome on the like that mic on that micro scale
3675.4,3677.08, Just like a couple of years and yeah
3677.08,3684.56, You got time to turn your tank around into like go around the mind that you know someone is laid and exactly and that respect the Supreme Commander
3684.56,3686.06, Kind of feels like you're in the war room
3686.2999999999997,3691.08, Be directing all these troops and it really in like right whether it's that X's and I was level or it's down in the ground
3691.08,3694.04, It's like just celebration of those massive armies if you're into that
3694.04,3697.56, You're gonna love the game if not you might want to consider like trying the demo first
3698.9,3705.82, Through and that's all I got to say about Supreme Commander for a moment until I actually get a chance to really dig into the Supreme
3705.82,3710.7," But man, I gotta say I try to keep track of like five different fronts in a battle on these huge maps"
3711.06,3713.56," Yeah, when you're hung over not fun"
3714.52,3716.52," Yeah, I got a problem with one front"
3717.52,3720.68, Five fronts forget that now I'm looking forward to it
3720.68,3726.04, But I I'm nervous about my ability to play it. No same thing I want to try but I had like my friends
3726.04,3730.12, I did play just company here is with the stuff in the same reason they've been on the multiplayer demo
3730.52,3733.72, First Supreme Commander and they're like you're not gonna like it's kind of funny
3733.72,3737.16, Like the first the first level of the game it just kind of like you start off in this really small areas
3737.16,3740.88," Okay, like you know walking you through introducing it to how to play it and it's like okay"
3740.88,3745.04, Set up a you know a mass extractor and send a generator and it quickly goes
3745.32,3749.84," Okay, now take out this now it's like within within my first hour of play"
3749.84,3753.84, I was like this huge ass map and trying to like you know do a sort you know a
3754.12,3756.2400000000002, Pinsor minot pincere attack flank it somebody like
3756.56,3759.04," Okay, I can get into it. I mean like it was just"
3760.4,3762.4, It jumps it jumps up pretty quick
3762.7200000000003,3766.28," But yeah, I already saw myself just like last something up with units is okay"
3766.28,3771.88, Let's move the artillery around them at the mountain range and have these guys come around here and it's really I mean
3772.52,3775.1200000000003, Part of it you can I'm sure someone's listening like do that guys
3775.1200000000003,3778.8," He just doesn't even right late and like right maybe that's the case, but yeah for me"
3778.8,3781.88, It's that moment and I'll admit to that I'm not your art
3781.88,3790.92, Just expert but but that moment comes though when you get so panic or so many units that you are throwing them all and like as soon as you've done throwing one
3790.92,3794.96, Group into the fray you're already moving to click another and you don't even get to see what's actually happening in the fray
3794.96,3799.0, You're just like rising your fingers that you've got enough like grip and so there I go over
3799.7200000000003,3804.64," Yeah, come the guard towers even though the guard towers are gonna be sniping the hell right I'm not the ideal player"
3804.64,3807.04, Either so it's it's lame to you know
3807.04,3811.16, It's not a diss of the game. It's more just adding an ultimate of my own retarded skills right
3811.16,3815.12," Yeah, I'm just you know clicking fast and hoping my resources don't run out"
3815.12,3819.2400000000002, And then I just click the mini map where I want them to go and I'm trying to build other units
3819.3599999999997,3821.3599999999997, That's really not how you're supposed to be playing
3822.64,3826.8399999999997," I've been playing a lot of the Titan Quest expansion. That's been my whole last week. Yeah, how is it?"
3827.3999999999996,3831.9399999999996," It's good, but it's hard really I mean even if like you level up your character and finish first"
3831.9399999999996,3839.9599999999996, I'm I'm playing the game with the character that I finished the the original game with and I had to do the like embarrassing horrible
3840.4799999999996,3843.4799999999996, humiliating thing of calling the developer and
3843.48,3845.48, And asking for help
3845.92,3849.6, Can either give me a twin character a cheat code so I can get past this part
3849.6,3855.04," No, I'm at the first boss battle of the expansion and I'm like I can't do it"
3855.04,3860.56," Well, you want to use supposed to go is that one of those moments where they want you to go and be on the same like"
3860.96,3863.16, Scorpions like another for another three hours
3863.16,3868.28, So I was growing enough to blow that so I'm not either I'm not high enough level or just if that's the case
3868.28,3871.32, That's that's that's no I don't blame the game actually
3871.32,3875.36, I really don't I because I believe that the build of the character I made
3876.0,3884.28, It is kind of weak. I think I didn't allocate skill points right and things like that so that my guy is not as good as he could
3884.28,3888.2400000000002," Yeah, but is it right to punish a guy if you if you if you don't allocate the skill points"
3888.2400000000002,3892.46, So I'm like if you're radically you have all these different varieties of skills to choose from and like
3892.46,3897.88, Chain off each other again to to I'm being nice to the game if I want to be mean to it if I want to be harder on it
3897.88,3901.0, I can say I would I did legitimately beat the first game
3901.0,3905.26, I did with this character and now this is the very next act of the game
3905.26,3911.36, Right and it's not like I'm getting beat by this boss like in a way where it's close
3911.6800000000003,3915.04, It's like I walk into the room and it's like damn dead
3916.1600000000003,3921.7400000000002," So I can't even come back. Okay, this time I'm gonna try going around the last and I'm gonna try hitting this combo"
3921.7400000000002,3923.5, So then I go and again dead
3923.5,3929.26, He's clearly a fire element will so I'm taking my fire mage and I'm just hitting with fire spell
3929.26,3935.9," If you fire spell and I can't seem to figure out why I think this game is broken right. Okay, you're mocking me, but see that"
3937.3,3939.78, This is the truth that is how I what you're doing
3939.78,3945.7," No, I don't do play that. I know you don't hit my right mental. No, I'm I'm walking in and there's these three"
3945.86,3949.98, There's these three elemental characters basically that there's three of them called that
3949.98,3955.34," What else are they gonna be into fantasy RPG? Okay, so I know so that was like so you free"
3955.34,3959.34, And but every different I can't even like try the different attacks was what I'm saying
3959.34,3963.0," I can't go in and say okay, this time I'm gonna yeah, because I'm just dead"
3963.0,3965.0, Do you have to listen any like
3965.0,3970.22, Exposition or anything as you go into that part of I think I ever type of a march and know you're destiny
3974.22,3975.82, Unskippable cut scene
3975.82,3977.82, I'm trying
3979.02,3983.42, You're like well screw you. I'm gonna hit you with the ice spell. I'm gonna seal and then up
3987.6200000000003,3988.6200000000003, Now I
3988.6200000000003,3992.92, So I'm gonna try to get with the different character. They're gonna they sent me a twink character
3992.92,3998.36," That's what I think like when you get to this first boss. Yeah, I was at one of those case where you just like ran right to the boss"
3998.36,4000.86, And did you get a chance like like maybe there's a hidden area with
4001.5,4005.78, Uber test is what I'm saying I die before there's any chance to do any of them
4005.82,4011.44, I'm just I walk in and I'm dead that sounds like classic like final fan and when every time I quit a final fan
4011.44,4014.52," Oh, yeah, tell you that's their way of telling you like you"
4014.52,4018.26, They do we don't we we want this game to last 40 hours for it
4018.26,4023.1600000000003, So go back into that desert and just beat on those things right took so much time modeling
4023.1600000000003,4026.6000000000004, And we don't want you to just fight 10 I did another three right and come back
4026.6000000000004,4032.1800000000003, I did it out the company easily if the level of my character is appropriate for where you're supposed to be
4032.18,4038.8599999999997, But the thing is time quest never has was never that kind of game the original game was not a grinding sort of game
4038.8599999999997,4046.04, It was a linear experience where you went from area to area and whatever area you happened to be in it was always level appropriate
4046.04,4048.68," Okay, so that's what I'm saying so where I am now"
4049.94,4056.16, If actually it is a matter of I'm supposed to be grinding then all the sudden they put in some rules that didn't exist before
4056.16,4061.22," Yeah, and I would say that that's not the boss as the boss kills you. He's not saying go back into the wild"
4061.22,4066.4599999999996, And fight the scorpions maybe Daniel be struggling after fight me so wait so Sean fundraising the game
4068.22,4071.74, That's the only piece and aren't always that's the Chicago way
4074.4199999999996,4079.22," You let me in yeah, so that's my experience and and and also it's taken me away from wow"
4079.22,4085.02, So that's kind of suck from Bernie Crusade however I was in I wanted to mention this to you Sean in particular
4085.02,4088.7, I was in Bernie Crusade a little bit this weekend on the one-up guild
4088.7,4092.8999999999996, I was just called can't quit you and there is now a member of the guild

4097.7,4100.5, Belled that P U U P so he got it
4104.5,4109.46, He didn't make up that word. I found it on her been dictionary. It was like I never said I did it
4109.46,4114.38, I say I said that's my thing. I call things cool. I own that
4114.38,4120.74, It was like I'm taking it that we're supposed to know if you play games. I'm sure you heard it because you've been called it any time you beat anyone in any game
4120.74,4124.58," I mean, there used to be different words for it, but you know the whole like well"
4124.58,4127.22, I wouldn't feel the beach you've I spent all day playing too
4127.22,4132.3, Like we're that I was sure like do I spent like 10 minutes playing it use 20 like that doesn't
4132.9400000000005,4137.5," People say that for everything street fighter moral combat chair, but that basically became there"
4137.5,4141.58, But I have a lot someone some genius said you know what there's a name for that as a poop soccer
4141.9,4143.58, Right
4143.58,4149.22, You know what you grabbed the song what was awesome when I played this weekend was was there certain questing will to work
4149.22,4154.26, Raph that are there like kind of epic quest for the zone and if you beat them
4154.58,4159.18, The game will actually do a shout in the chat channel to the whole zone
4159.18,4165.68," Let people say you know, so there was actually a moment this weekend where it's at all hail all hail the poop"
4165.68,4167.68, Through the entire world. Yeah
4168.240000000001,4171.04," People care about this, you know, they're like is there playing there like"

4175.4800000000005,4177.4800000000005, All hail poop suck
4177.4800000000005,4179.4800000000005," Also, there's another guy in the girl named"
4179.84,4181.84, Turd nugget and
4181.84,4183.12, See
4183.12,4189.62, But but that also came flunk like you can it like if you just take one minute and you're like I need to don't name a dope beef swelling
4189.62,4195.14, Like that is the better than turn it mine is vomit which I thought was pretty clever in my own way
4195.26,4200.26," No, why am I taking it but but the third but Turd nugget came from"
4200.26,4203.58, Fieget it was we got by poop socks
4203.58,4208.66, So I'm saying so you know this whole dumb fecal movie. I got started by God
4208.66,4215.0599999999995, Fieke like you and by this pocket so I'm sorry and any any potential future one-up
4215.06,4220.860000000001," Man, I'm sorry. Yeah, come up with something we're done with that little little more a little more veiled"
4220.860000000001,4224.3, Please I'm not saying because poop sock and Turd nugget are probably living now
4224.3,4229.860000000001, We love you guys keep on keeping on but no more from other new players
4230.860000000001,4235.120000000001," What yeah, no, it's good. Tell them to tell them the next guy. She laid out a lot of money or something"

4259.2,4263.12, Let's quickly get in a couple of reader things and then try to get out of here
4263.2,4270.08, But oh my god in an hour already. Oh my god. Oh my god. Maybe length is the secret to cracking 37 you think yeah
4272.36,4277.0, The first role 20 minutes or so they already fast forward. We got to make a port
4277.92,4279.92, That's a good or bad thing
4280.16,4282.16," Okay, so we have some choice"
4282.36,4284.64, We have some choice reader ones and the one I I
4285.28,4288.64, Wanted to address the one hostile one so we do that first
4288.64,4292.72, Plane because I thought he I know there's some good feedback for that I mean that week that we could have
4292.72,4296.360000000001, I mean just looking at him like oh I got a response right I know that's why I wanted to read it
4296.360000000001,4298.860000000001," Okay, so I'm gonna read it"
4299.360000000001,4301.360000000001, Right do you want to write it?

4316.160000000001,4318.160000000001, Jim Morgan
4318.16,4321.36, Why don't you guys all go fuck yourself? Yeah
4322.2,4326.36, Hearing you complain about your jobs aren't as fun as they seem really pissed me off
4326.36,4329.0, I would seriously cut off my balls to work
4329.0,4331.0, We're even intern in the games industry
4331.0,4335.639999999999, I will mail you to his both my nuts and a little package right now if I can work it you're off

4339.28,4341.28, When you say balls is good
4343.28,4346.639999999999, I say we got to take him up on this offer before you finish this letter
4346.64,4351.200000000001," We get there's a box that shows up on my desk with two human testicle. Oh no, don't even"
4351.200000000001,4353.280000000001, That's our new intern you got the job buddy
4353.92,4359.820000000001, Better still you won't be reproduced action say that cuz what if he does then moms could be mad at us do not just
4359.820000000001,4365.88," Green said please keep your ball. Okay keep reading. I'm sorry Ryan can be the rest. Oh, got stoked the rage Ryan"
4370.160000000001,4372.160000000001, My current job
4372.16,4374.16, I'm looking up the train
4374.5599999999995,4378.2, My current job and a word working shop such shit from a poop shop
4378.96,4384.62, He's around being around milling machines is dangerous and nobody I work with knows what new brothel or beaten
4385.72,4387.72, My boss whoa
4387.72,4390.84, Stupid something. Let's just know that I was gonna harsh I
4391.5599999999995,4395.8, Work nine hours a day six days a week so that rich people can have their furniture
4396.24,4401.639999999999, You guys get to interview developers play games months before we do and just think about peachy games all day
4401.64,4407.52, I know running a magazine must get administrative point task to but you guys should be happy for being in the position you are
4408.12,4411.68," Okay, I want to say you were you're reading that in the bit of a mocking tone there"
4411.96,4416.92," However, I think it's a really good plethora. Okay. He was angry. He used some bad words"
4417.56,4425.6," He was bitter towards us, but I would imagine if you're a guy like this guy who's working in a woodworking shop and his boss is a stupid"
4426.12,4428.12, Something something that
4428.280000000001,4430.280000000001," It would be annoying, but I think"
4430.679999999999,4436.44, When we were bitching about our jobs that last week I think we were the implication wasn't
4436.92,4442.2, That we want to quit and work somewhere that's easier. It was just is there a place?
4442.84,4447.5599999999995," Yeah, I mean I think it's just everybody can complain about their job, right?"
4447.5599999999995,4451.719999999999, And in a way we are just sort of complaining that as much fun as it is
4451.719999999999,4457.34, It's not quite as fun as people may think it is if they don't know because we actually have to spend a lot of our time
4457.82,4464.8," Making the magazine part. Yeah, it's not to say that the making the magazine part isn't also kind of easy and it's like it's"
4464.8,4469.0, So it's tough. You know you spend your whole day playing games and we're like what don't spend my whole day playing games
4469.0,4471.0, But you're still ready
4471.0,4472.0, I think
4472.0,4477.28," I'm talking and we announce that we're still pretty damn lucky. Oh, yeah, absolutely"
4477.52,4478.52, Very blessed about it
4478.52,4487.08, And I believe everybody in this room here has worked some pretty shitty jobs over time. I know I have and so we have the perspective of knowing
4487.08,4491.76, What actual work is and I think it is safe to say this kind of is
4493.08,4497.36," No, I'm not gonna say you do we want to have like a you know whip it out. I just got the world"
4497.36,4501.46," Well, we could I I'm not we have the time this way if some there's some fun stuff. I'm sure we"
4502.46,4505.14, Real quick the other things like I think I has Jeff
4505.7,4511.44, For the dude's name because I knew I knew one of I know one of the Hollywood stars had a situation in the elegance to our own
4511.68,4514.34, And that was even Hugh Grant has got
4514.34,4521.400000000001," Yeah, Elizabeth Hurley no less a woman than then Liz Hurley and he went out and like that wasn't enough form"
4521.400000000001,4527.02, It's something he was like you know what this chicken continent right so he went out and he hooked up
4527.02,4529.02, He got yeah something nasty
4529.7,4534.860000000001," Yeah, so I don't know maybe that's the equivalent of us being like you know taking the job for granted and saying"
4535.42,4538.82, Well if we didn't get to play games all day we only had to talk about it
4539.46,4541.46, I don't know if it was yeah
4541.46,4545.42, So basically this job is looking the crack hole for perspective though
4545.42,4547.02, I mean he wants to
4547.82,4550.46, Maybe that it now she doesn't hold up under screw in the other hair
4551.46,4556.1, I can't understand I think it does I think it just means you take for granted no matter how good you've got it
4556.1,4559.74, You're gonna take it for granted. It's right wait and do something stupid. I know I was
4560.74,4562.74, He was a huge grant when that story came out
4562.74,4563.94, I mean I do would yeah
4564.94,4567.18," Yeah, and what are you doing?"
4567.18,4572.780000000001," You're like no no no no, so that's what this guy is like us right in his funny and it's right"
4572.780000000001,4575.52, If that was the impression they think that we made then the guy's totally right
4575.52,4580.46," He is totally right, which is why I was saying let's not mock that letter just just start with the job"
4580.46,4583.66, I was like I were you know and I'm not saying like you know
4583.66,4585.900000000001, I could go back and if you want to do the odd jobs or whatever
4585.900000000001,4587.900000000001," Sure like we could do that, but that's not the point"
4587.900000000001,4591.34, I mean like full time right no during during school during your at school
4591.34,4595.66, We're yeah full time grocery stores and that was a huge step up over the other shit that I won't say that I did
4596.62,4603.099999999999, But for example there you know it's like we're gonna produce department and you have to carefully hand stack every pyramid for every time of food
4603.099999999999,4605.58, And then dovetail them all together the guys you work for
4605.98,4609.099999999999, No one cares of course the customers come in and they just want to tear through it
4609.099999999999,4614.3, And they all think that they've got the best way to like pick out a watermelner something and none of them know anything about it
4614.3,4617.34, You know and so meanwhile as they're tearing it apart
4617.66,4620.7, My my managers are like on my ass like make sure
4620.7,4624.86, The pyramids and stacks are perfect if anything is wrong or turn the chance turned around
4624.86,4627.74, I used to have a boss was it asked for about even if it was true though
4627.74,4633.42, Imagine if like a two-comber there are actually two sides and if you had I had one two-comber the wrong way in this big display
4633.74,4638.94, And that was caused for like almost getting written up being yelled at and then you go back out after you listen to that from the manager
4638.94,4645.66, You go back in the floor and you see the old lady just ripping through that thing like chuck and corn and leaving the shit on the ground
4646.0599999999995,4648.0599999999995, Like some kind of freaking Iowa even
4648.06,4650.06, You know
4650.06,4654.38, Every minute I'm in that kind of job and then the next day so you get done with that and then the next minute
4654.38,4660.06, It's like wait clean up in the men's restroom shot can we get a wet clean up in the men's restroom and a wet clean up is exactly what you think
4660.06,4665.5, You it's so I mean that kind of stuff would go on you know 40 hours a week and then I would often do shifts
4665.5,4668.46, You know 2 a.m. I was one of the start to get off it noon the next day
4669.18,4670.54, So yes
4670.54,4673.34, That sort of thing definitely put it in perspective of how
4674.3,4678.78, fortunate I feel to have this position today and so don't ever let me say
4678.78,4682.14," I was oh yeah, I feel extremely grateful and blessed"
4683.42,4688.3, Now I said for me I think probably the word the worst thing about my job is that I love it too much and then I sit there like
4689.02,4694.38, I've had jobs in like other magazines and other industries and whatever and like I would just I would be a nine to five
4694.38,4696.54, Right show up get my crap done and I leave and that's it
4696.54,4698.54, I just go out and have fun with the boys
4698.86,4703.82," No, I'm playing games all the time. I'm focusing I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm not saying that"
4703.82,4706.3, But I'm like but I'm also like game I'll wake up before in the morning
4706.3,4712.14, I had this great idea for a story and I'm writing stuff down and like I might my sleep patterns are all screwy because I'm thinking of articles
4712.14,4715.42, I'd love to write it just stuff that's fun that you probably do in your normal life
4715.42,4721.98, It actually you can do it you can share with someone like I can and that's exactly some dumb video and then like just because of the job
4721.98,4723.98, I have I can like get it on a video show
4723.98,4727.58, Right and then people saying good job pretty magazine
4728.299999999999,4732.299999999999," Yeah, like so I brain I think it's a great employee. Let's do a story on that you know, I mean like yeah"
4732.299999999999,4735.099999999999," That's the you know, I think it's it's a blessing that's the blessing"
4735.099999999999,4736.78, I think if you ask anybody in the game industry
4736.78,4742.299999999999, It's exactly what they say most times is I love this job because like it's like the thing I love doing most but at the same point
4742.299999999999,4746.7, I wish I had more time to like you know spend it with my wife or whatever you do see people
4747.82,4750.459999999999, Like some of you younger kids
4751.34,4756.22, You know who come to one up or like scooter who who I love and he's been around for forever now
4756.38,4759.66, But like he is first job when he was 16
4759.9800000000005,4763.82, Actually was at computer gaming world and he's just done that since he was right
4763.82,4770.7, That's a whole other story part of me wants to say you know what you should go out for a couple years and go work a real job
4770.7,4771.74, Totally because
4771.74,4774.7, I should now that he's laid off how nice of me
4774.7,4780.38," You are laid off by opium you are the son of bitch, but you know you want to say like you need a real job to put"
4780.54,4785.5, This and perspective how right is I've heard tons of that like when when then she hired me
4785.5,4791.1, GM back when he was like telling me's like look up really glad that you've done all the stuff because I mean when I interviewed my flu out
4791.5,4796.06, Like the next day had to be back the protest farm and I remember going back it's who I am the next day
4796.06,4800.78, He was like know this is good because there are a lot of people that just get entitled they feel entitled to this
4801.26,4805.5, And they come here and then so the first thing they do they go into a press junk in and they're treating them the launch and stuff
4805.5,4809.5, You know and they just like feel like all this stuff is owed to them and just right
4810.06,4811.5, Not same scooters like that
4811.5,4816.46," No, I definitely think it's a different perspective because I didn't get that fear like you're like you know what this is too good"
4816.46,4818.7, This can't last and I know exactly what I'm gonna
4820.7,4822.7, So I'm going to be
4823.26,4825.26, Stack in cue come
4825.26,4827.26, Talk too much shit on it
4827.26,4829.26, I brought up that exact point in
4829.26,4832.54, And the call my guess wrote it was because there is a sense of entitlement that a lot of
4832.54,4835.34, Game editors and writers think you know they're in they have
4835.9,4838.62, I mean it's totally on unfounded most at a time
4840.06,4843.82, It's tricky because then there's other thing as I'm not I mean I definitely think I mean there's something
4843.82,4846.86, It's not entitlement for example to tell PR people like hey
4846.86,4850.38, This is the kind of story that we want to do maybe you can help us but we don't want it
4850.38,4853.66, So you tell us what story isn't who's writing it and this and then that's not entitlement
4853.66,4859.1," That's doing your job. No, no, I mean what I'm talking about is a guy's who think they have this chip on a show like they're like they're owed something right"
4859.1,4863.1," Yeah, let me in this fun line next time and give me an extra help and pizza"
4863.660000000001,4870.820000000001, Just like versions like a thousand versions of that same voice now every different flavors of voice
4871.820000000001,4874.860000000001, So we need it we hear you we hear you Jim Morgan
4875.58,4881.42, We are we are not in grades. We actually right the voice of the dude that basically surface for air and a bad of gravy
4885.660000000001,4887.5, The grunt well I liked
4888.38,4891.9800000000005, Such and such I hosted party better because they served pickled muppin hearts
4894.06,4896.06, Ha
4896.46,4898.46, People love
4898.46,4900.46, Bullish
4901.34,4903.34, Fucking frugal frog
4904.700000000001,4907.26," That's when you know your fat. Yeah, it goes a little bit hard"
4907.820000000001,4910.06, Why don't we take one more question and then that oh?
4910.06,4913.26, So many good ones to wrap it up. There are a bunch of good ones. We'll see everyone next week. I guess
4914.46,4918.14, Who's gonna kill which one? I don't know what you say Ryan
4918.9400000000005,4921.740000000001, And what which one do you guys you're the boss Ryan you pick it?
4923.18,4925.18, Tony's at the boss you are
4926.620000000001,4930.780000000001, I was all silent too Ryan was silent during the last one because I think so you came straight out of
4931.42,4935.740000000001," Whatever school and the internship now, but the Ryan I believe you had crap jobs, didn't you?"
4936.14,4938.14, my only
4938.14,4940.14, Employment experience prior to this is retail
4940.700000000001,4942.06, What a common store right?
4942.06,4947.900000000001, Hello actually. I worked at bookstore. Okay. I worked at a Walden books and I worked at a Sam Gooding Music Store. Okay
4947.900000000001,4950.22, So I remember that said good on it those jobs
4950.38,4952.9400000000005, So people come in and they're like shit. What's that song? What's it song?
4955.820000000001,4958.14, You're like I got just the thing for you take a
4958.62,4965.66," Technotronic you're like check this right here. Oh, man. Oh, shit. Oh, you know what if I shoot we got that we used to get a lot of the people who would"
4966.9400000000005,4972.46, Would bring in like random VHS tapes that they bought somewhere like five years ago and be trying to return
4973.66,4975.9800000000005," It's like stuff that's not even in printing anymore, right?"
4976.299999999999,4981.099999999999, Just like the produce equivalent of a guy that come across agamush and put it in my hand and like what's this?
4981.9,4986.379999999999, Is that a squash was like what did you buy like that? Do you buy a bag of shit? I didn't think so
4990.54,4992.54, I was
4992.54,4997.339999999999, I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't a super but I was doing all the grunt work for a coat for a complex for a living
4997.339999999999,4999.339999999999, Housing complex and buffalo New York
4999.339999999999,5003.82," And yeah, it was lovely town and like I was doing all the clean up stuff, you know people moved out"
5003.82,5007.0199999999995, I remember I went into one room. There's like I think they would call me it basically
5007.0199999999995,5010.78, But when things were like I was you know college dude and they'd call me and help out and then I'd leave
5011.42,5015.42, One one up like the day I quit I walk into one of the rooms. There's like a freaking shock out line on the floor
5017.82,5019.0199999999995, I'm like
5019.0199999999995,5019.82, Look out
5019.82,5025.5, So bring out this thing like so so bring for me to is like and everyone should have the moment or or not
5025.5,5029.099999999999, I hope they don't is when you're clean and another human being's easy
5030.06,5032.38, You and you know you're doing a page
5032.38,5038.620000000001, In a way to do it so it says man this dude would pay me like Chris Rockson this guy would pay me less to do this
5038.620000000001,5040.620000000001, But it's against the law
5041.42,5043.58, You do that and it's also in home movie
5043.740000000001,5048.3, There's a moment where the guy that works in the good there's cemetery is like he looks himself
5048.3,5052.06, You know I'm clean this is what I'm doing and I will say I did it to you
5052.46,5056.22, I was I had a janitor job at the dorms that you see birth
5056.22,5059.820000000001," Oh, yeah, I had the turn of the world I had to turn it over for school"
5060.3,5066.06," Yep, yeah, that's my parents were not paying for me to go to college so I had to earn my way through and I did that"
5066.06,5067.5, I got the share
5067.5,5069.900000000001, I might have cleaned the same toilet shop
5070.62,5075.58, My real closer you already my version was like in between the dorms when the kids were moving out of the dorms
5075.58,5078.54, And the next one's come in to do a total turnover on the dorm
5079.1,5083.42," So to scrub the furniture clean the bathroom. Yeah, you know, what's weird is like I was a student at the time"
5083.74,5088.78, And then but then when I'm like cleaning toilets at the dorm I felt like I was like cleaning the the
5089.02,5091.02, Pro-let's students toilets
5091.02,5095.02," Yeah, I thought we did like I like they'd look at me and I'm like no, no, man. I'm a student too"
5095.5,5097.5, You know
5098.14,5100.14, Don't look at me like that
5100.14,5102.14, Career that you're backpack
5102.14,5104.14, I'm getting the degree
5104.14,5108.46, It's like you're like seriously anybody who like has any questions about what they want to do in life
5108.46,5110.54, Just do that for a freaking day and you're gonna know for sure
5110.54,5112.54, You want to go finish college and do it right because
5113.1,5118.94, You don't have some say I work I mean like I got an undergrad degree and then I was doing produce still
5118.94,5122.06," Yeah, I was doing I was doing I was doing it I was doing registrary"
5122.06,5124.06, It's not a no guarantee when you made your an English
5126.62,5129.18, I just thought that works like great about video game
5130.86,5133.74, So I don't even know if we have time for a serious letter now
5134.46,5137.0199999999995, A bunch of you thought it was a good but the kind of the kind of serious
5137.0199999999995,5139.9," Well, you can there's the we have to high school on instead"
5139.9,5141.9, I was saying that's the only show what I could find
5143.099999999999,5145.099999999999, Jenna H asks
5145.74,5147.74, Is that sounds like a girl?
5147.74,5152.139999999999," Yeah, the question is oh, why don't other I see okay the question is why does high school suck?"
5152.94,5156.78," Oh, and why don't other high school girls realize how amazing nerds are?"
5156.78,5159.74," Yes, let's tell him I got to say it's Jenna where the hell were you?"
5160.46,5161.98, For me 30 years
5161.98,5164.62, For all the people that dude you think it's a dude
5165.0199999999995,5167.0199999999995, James James really Jared
5167.5,5169.58, Even if the dude I would have been with him 30 years
5170.94,5172.94, I was lonely
5174.38,5178.78, That's a great question high school that's suck though doesn't suck as bad as mental school though
5178.94,5184.38, You know I wonder if like you know I guess I wonder if nerds are looking down upon like you know people who use computers and stuff
5184.38,5190.7," Or look is looked down upon now as they were like, you know a question because everyone everyone's a nerd now"
5190.86,5194.78," Right, so I'm even so I'm with that many people are playing work craft and stuff"
5194.78,5198.46," I mean, Dungeons and Dragons that made you a nerd back in the day now it's like everyone"
5198.46,5201.82," Work crafts like made that respectable yeah, unless I'm around to make it"
5201.82,5205.58, But I mean like back then like not many people were like in high school like who was really playing video games?
5205.58,5209.66," You know the you know the basement dwellers. Okay, so I want to throw this question back"
5209.66,5216.94, There was this like in my area and I'm 31 like the stoneers who I mean get around to someone's house and play some mortal combat and say
5216.94,5220.0599999999995," Good, I'm from a like he tell I was something PC specifically"
