14.16,20.44," so Jeff Green, the editor-in-chief of GFW Magazine and I'm here with three of my trusty"
20.44,22.44, compodries today. They are.
22.44,23.76, Friends got?
23.76,24.720000000000002, Darren Gladstone.
24.720000000000002,25.720000000000002, Sean DeBaloy.
25.720000000000002,26.520000000000003, Hi boys.
26.520000000000003,27.520000000000003, Hi.
27.520000000000003,28.840000000000003, Sean Elliott.
28.840000000000003,30.0, Out today.
30.0,32.2, This sick.
32.2,33.2, He is sick.
33.2,39.6, He's very sick. He actually sounds like whiskey nerd without having to do a funny rendering
39.6,42.96, of it. So he's taken a pass this week.
42.96,47.72," So you Sean Elliott fans can, I guess, just hit stop right now and move on with something"
47.72,52.72, else in your life. But don't do that because you'll make the for of a sad little bit.
52.72,53.72, I don't care enough.
53.72,54.72, I see you.
54.72,55.72, We don't care.
55.72,57.72, Go to hell.
57.72,62.72," So we, there's sort of like the big topic."
62.72,64.72, We all know about it.
64.72,65.72, It's like your life.
65.72,66.72, Dancer owner just go right now.
66.72,67.72, This is great to it.
67.72,73.72," I'm actually super, super tired, not just because I worked all weekend and"
73.72,75.72, tired from deadlines.
75.72,79.72," But also because I played a lot, a lot of Starcraft one."
79.72,80.72, Did you?
80.72,81.72, I did.
81.72,83.72, You were just inspired by the ice.
83.72,88.72, I got caught up in the white heat of the the hype and frenzy.
88.72,89.72, Yeah.
89.72,90.72, Starcraft.
90.72,92.72, I got a one-stall in a play.
92.72,94.72, So that's what I did.
94.72,95.72, So yeah.
95.72,96.72, So that's a big news.
96.72,97.72, Starcraft two.
97.72,98.72, Big surprise.
98.72,99.72, Chuck.
99.72,101.72, We call it here first.
101.72,102.72, Yeah.
102.72,103.72, Wow.
103.72,105.72, Who saw that one coming?
105.72,106.72, Oh yeah.
106.72,107.72, Everybody.
107.72,109.72," But hey, it was stoke sighting."
109.72,110.72, Yeah.
110.72,111.72, It was.
111.72,116.72, I was actually sitting at my computer at 11 like every other moron or Pacific time 11.
116.72,118.72, Like in refresh until the stuff went up.
118.72,119.72, Started going up.
119.72,120.72, Started going up.
120.72,121.72, Yeah.
121.72,122.72, Same.
122.72,123.72, Yeah.
123.72,126.72, I was getting a little rush when I was watching that trailer.
126.72,130.72," So just like, you know, because I don't like the blizzard just made has awesome trailers for all of us."
130.72,131.72, Yeah.
131.72,132.72, Yeah.
132.72,134.72," But, you know, a fanboy stuff aside."
134.72,137.72," I'm kind of like, I actually kind of curious how you guys feel about the whole thing."
137.72,142.72," The fact that they took the original game and just kind of get, you know, they kind of gave it a 3D treatment with some play balancing."
142.72,143.72, It looks like so far.
143.72,144.72," Well, yeah."
144.72,146.72, That was the weird thing is they unveiled it.
146.72,147.72, How do you guys feel about that?
147.72,148.72," I mean, I feel good."
148.72,153.72," I mean, I think I was expecting like when we were going into this like I was like, oh, is it going to be world of starcraft?"
153.72,157.72," It's going to be some crazy RTS hybrid that, you know, who knows what it'll be."
157.72,163.72, So many things they could do and then they unveil it and it's just straight up as you could possibly imagine starcraft to it.
163.72,164.72, Right.
164.72,165.72, That's possible.
165.72,167.72," Straight up and I'm like, oh, okay."
167.72,168.72," Do I, what do I feel about it?"
168.72,169.72, I didn't know how to feel.
169.72,176.72, It's odd because it really is almost like kind of like the minimum of what I don't want to say this in two bad advice.
176.72,180.72, But it's like the minimum of what anyone would do who had no real imagination.
180.72,181.72," It's like, okay."
181.72,183.72," Oh, I don't mean it that harsh."
183.72,192.72," But what I mean is like, you know, if you took like random game company X and separated eight years from their first game to the sequel, you would go, okay."
192.72,194.72," Well, now let's do it in 3D."
194.72,195.72, Mm-hmm.
195.72,199.72, And that seems to be the basic big thing.
199.72,200.72, Right.
200.72,203.72," I mean, the fact that there wasn't even a fourth race, I thought was really surprising."
203.72,208.72," Well, wasn't the whole thing with starcraft, like how perfectly balanced it's three factions?"
208.72,209.72, Yes.
209.72,210.72, Yes.
210.72,211.72, That's true.
211.72,212.72, That's a big question.
212.72,215.72," This has got to be a case of just like, if it is a harsh stone fix it."
215.72,216.72, Yeah.
216.72,217.72, It's not right.
217.72,225.72," You have an entire nation of people who would like if you screw this up, if you throw the balance out of whack, or it's going to be very upset, because this is such a huge thing over there."
225.72,231.72," Well, it is interesting that what they've shown so far is that they mean they are kind of messing, well, I wouldn't say messing with the balance, but definitely changing the balance things."
231.72,232.72, Right.
232.72,233.72, So everyone's going to have to have a real-en tactics.
233.72,237.72," Also, I mean, obviously, this is so early."
237.72,240.72," And really, all they showed us was new protest units, right?"
240.72,242.72," We have new, new, pure protest units."
242.72,243.72, Yeah.
243.72,244.72, And it's necessarily show all of them.
244.72,248.72," So we're basically going to entirely on, like, a very small segment at the first announcement."
248.72,250.72, This is going to be more coming.
250.72,251.72, Of course.
251.72,253.72, This game is going to be like Street Fighter.
253.72,261.72," The Street Fighter II games, when like, Super Street Fighter II came out of whatever, you know, most people like us are like, oh, well, it's just the same game."
261.72,262.72, Yeah.
262.72,263.72, But with some more moving stuff.
263.72,269.72," But the insane people who played it at these like high tournament levels, you know, just as very clear to them."
269.72,270.72, Right.
270.72,279.72," You know, I mean, it seems like, I mean, I got the impression watching it that they're clearly like, it's almost like Korea's really the first market for this one."
279.72,280.72, That's why they're doing it.
280.72,281.72, Right.
281.72,282.72," I mean, yeah, duh."
282.72,283.72, They announced it there.
283.72,287.72," And so it seems like, in a way, it's like, we have to defer to the Koreans to see if they're going to like it first."
287.72,289.72, And then we'll know whether it's good or not.
289.72,292.72," Like, if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for us."
292.72,295.72," Because, but it just seems like weird, like, so to weird development."
295.72,306.72," And I can't even think of another precedent where there's like a North American company whose game now basically belongs to another country, you know, as the first market."
306.72,307.72, Yeah.
307.72,308.72, Pretty interesting.
308.72,309.72, Yeah.
309.72,313.72, That's probably the one that I guess world of workcraft.
313.72,315.72," Yeah, but we're still the main."
315.72,316.72, Aren't we?
316.72,318.72, I think we're world of workcraft.
318.72,319.72, Yeah.
319.72,320.72, Maybe.
320.72,321.72, Channel have the numbers working out.
321.72,322.72, I don't know either.
322.72,323.72, I've got to turn it.
323.72,324.72, I've got to turn it.
324.72,326.72," Certainly in terms of like the multiplayer competition, obviously."
326.72,327.72," Oh, yeah."
327.72,329.72, I think I'll tell you television channels for that.
329.72,330.72, Yeah.
330.72,331.72, And then we don't.
331.72,341.72," I didn't mean to say that I was like disappointed by it, but it, I was just a little surprised at how kind of conservative it was."
341.72,343.72," It was, it strike me as conservative."
343.72,344.72, But I'm okay with that.
344.72,345.72, Yeah.
345.72,346.72, I think we all to go.
346.72,347.72, Do I like this?
347.72,348.72," I was like, right."
348.72,350.72," It's weird because you have like, workcraft three, which is."
351.72,352.72,avorite so three.
352.72,354.72, Single tasks before我練 Squaw's yoosel was clear.
354.72,357.72," It would contain biraz differently, but"
357.72,359.72," I think so much that most of us who can circle me in on Starcraft's animation,"
359.72,361.72," like what I want to read right because I think on a release,"
361.72,362.72," maybe I will exactly pay as much much extra money as we are,"
362.72,364.72, who could have conserved motion with their party.
364.72,365.72, I do.
365.72,367.72, But we're willing to lay that down somehow.
367.72,370.72," We could have talked about that in the beginning of the assignments,"
370.72,373.72, and a dialogue with each other and you educated your own company in.
373.72,375.72," So then by the way, essentially using that word,"
375.72,377.72," one of just scandals, somebody like you,"
377.72,379.72, you're certain the most expensive company you were overall mostlyicky.
379.72,380.56, that they do encourage us.
380.56,382.08000000000004, The Starcraft is so fast.
382.08000000000004,382.36, Yeah.
382.36,383.20000000000005, Exactly.
383.20000000000005,383.40000000000003, Yeah.
383.40000000000003,385.12, And like watching people level up hero units
385.12,386.84000000000003, is probably not that interesting until it is.
386.84000000000003,387.68, Which is right.
387.68,387.84000000000003, Yeah.
387.84000000000003,389.20000000000005," And actually, I should say, if you haven't"
389.20000000000005,390.64000000000004," downloaded the video off the Starcraft 2,"
390.64000000000004,391.84000000000003, so you should definitely check out the game.
391.84000000000003,393.88000000000005, It's like a 20 minute gameplay video that really just
393.88000000000005,396.48, kind of walks you through the basics of how well they're
396.48,398.48, doing the play balancing.
398.48,401.04, And it is beautiful looking.
401.04,401.48, Yeah.
401.48,405.8," I mean, once again, there are direction is pretty awesome."
405.8,406.32000000000005, Yeah.
406.32000000000005,409.08000000000004," Even at the stage, it was cool enough looking for me to go out"
409.08,410.08, with a damn.
410.08,411.08, Okay.
411.08,412.08," Well, it's on those things."
412.08,413.08, They look to Grash Holy shit.
413.08,414.08," Well, I looked at the I saw the screenshots."
414.08,416.08," Plus when they evolve, that's pretty sick."
416.08,418.08, Because I saw the screenshots first.
418.08,419.08," And I was like, okay, that looks pretty good."
419.08,420.08, Yeah.
420.08,421.08, Like blow me away.
421.08,423.08," But like most positive games, like that's only like half"
423.08,424.08, of the equation.
424.08,425.08, Yeah.
425.08,426.08, And it's just so good.
426.08,427.08, Yeah.
427.08,428.08, The way things are moving.
428.08,429.08, Yeah.
429.08,432.08, So I played Starcraft 1 a lot.
432.08,435.08," And even those old nine year old graphics, you know,"
435.08,437.08," I mean, obviously they're dated."
437.08,441.08," And it would never pass, muster today as a new game."
441.08,445.56," But even now, these years later, it's still, they're still, the unit still"
445.56,446.56, moving cool ways.
446.56,448.56, They still do neat things.
448.56,450.8," You know, the general art direction is cool."
450.8,455.56," However, I kept no matter how many times I did it and it didn't work,"
455.56,458.56, I kept trying to zoom in with the mouse wheel.
458.56,460.56, I never worked.
460.56,461.56, It's stuff like that.
461.56,464.56, I'll probably use the warm move the camera at all.
464.56,465.56, Right.
466.32,469.32, Certain innovations that'll surely be in there.
469.32,470.0," Oh, right."
470.0,471.52, Did they demonstrate all that stuff?
471.52,472.52, Yep.
472.52,473.52, Did they demonstrate it?
473.52,474.52, Did they camera moving?
474.52,475.52," Well, they kind of like they didn't really announce it."
475.52,476.52, They showed it off.
476.52,477.52, Yeah.
477.52,478.52, Yeah.
478.52,479.52, There were a couple scenes where it's like doing that.
479.52,482.32," Like they froze it and paned around it, action shot."
482.32,484.56, Kind of thing.
484.56,486.56, And that trailer was great.
486.56,487.96, That cut scene was.
487.96,491.32, It's weird because like after it was over and like you see the tagline on the
491.32,492.56," website, new the hell."
492.56,493.56, It's a lot of time.
493.56,495.52," And you're just like, that was an awful"
495.52,499.76, lot of effort for like basically a joke.
499.76,500.76," Yeah, it's kind of true."
500.76,504.32," Because like the put his arm around, you know, the whole thing is that taking"
504.32,505.88, a long time to put his arm around.
505.88,510.35999999999996, But it's really also like it's been 10 years since Starcraft 1.
510.35999999999996,513.12," Well, what do you think's been happening when they have to, you know, when you,"
513.12,516.52," when you, from the time you order up a Marines that time they actually show up, you know,"
516.52,519.84," you just hear that, no, where do I know how it's going to go?"
519.84,520.84, That's why.
520.84,522.4399999999999," Yeah, good point there."
522.4399999999999,523.4399999999999, Wow.
523.44,525.6800000000001," Kind of behind the scenes inside the barracks, right?"
525.6800000000001,526.2800000000001, There you go.
526.2800000000001,528.6800000000001, I'm sure you all ordered your limited edition.
528.6800000000001,530.6800000000001, Take this fined blade.
530.6800000000001,531.8800000000001, Statues off the website.
531.8800000000001,532.6800000000001," Oh, yeah."
532.6800000000001,533.6800000000001," Oh, yeah."
533.6800000000001,535.4000000000001, It's funny going through the campaign again now.
535.4000000000001,537.6400000000001, It's like I forgot the whole plot.
537.6400000000001,538.32, Basically.
538.32,539.8000000000001, I don't remember any of these guys.
539.8000000000001,540.6400000000001," Like, yeah."
540.6400000000001,542.44," Like, I remember Carrigan."
542.44,543.5200000000001," Carrigan, I remember."
543.5200000000001,544.0, Yeah.
544.0,544.5200000000001, That's about it.
544.5200000000001,546.9200000000001, Let's like the moment that I latched onto.
546.9200000000001,548.72," Actually, the one thing I forgot about Carrigan."
548.72,551.5600000000001, I remember her character because it's so tragic.
551.56,554.1199999999999, But I forgot how sexy her voice is.
554.1199999999999,555.52," Like, I'm her."
555.52,556.1999999999999," Quick, good."
556.1999999999999,557.04, I am to be.
557.04,558.04, Let's check her out.
558.04,559.04, Is all you did?
559.04,560.04, Just click her.
560.04,561.04, Kind of over.
561.04,562.4799999999999," Yeah, if you kept giggling."
562.4799999999999,564.28," Oh, you really nice time there."
564.28,565.04, You did you don't mean to.
565.04,566.92," To win the morning battle, battle change."
566.92,568.4799999999999," Yeah, if that's life and the other round."
568.4799999999999,570.8," Jeff, come to bed."
570.8,572.28, I'm clicking on Carrigan.
572.28,574.0799999999999, I'll be there soon.
574.0799999999999,576.0799999999999, Double click.
576.0799999999999,581.3599999999999," Uh, Ryan, did you play Starcraft in the day?"
581.36,586.64, I kind of got into RTS games after Starcraft.
586.64,587.64, After Starcraft.
587.64,588.64, Yeah.
588.64,590.64," Yeah, because that was so pass A by the time."
590.64,593.5600000000001," Well, I mean, when I first got into him, I don't know."
593.5600000000001,595.64," It was like 2000, 2000, or something."
595.64,596.64, Okay.
596.64,599.6800000000001," Like, it was like, oh, this game's, I'll play this new game."
599.6800000000001,600.92," Yeah, it makes sense."
600.92,604.0, The Starcraft is right about when I was getting into them.
604.0,608.48," So, although I did play the first one I played was like, doing two on the second"
608.48,609.48, genesis.
610.48,611.12, Wow.
611.12,613.72," Really console RTS is our just, they've been around for a while."
613.72,615.12," Oh, you know, there's hard, there's hers on."
615.12,616.12," Wait, nothing wrong with that."
616.12,617.12, I played that.
617.12,618.12, That was awesome.
618.12,619.12, That was.
619.12,620.12, The Warcraft one was my first.
620.12,621.6," Yeah, I played, replayed that."
621.6,623.0, Not nearly as much as Starcraft.
623.0,626.64," Starcraft was like, once we figured out in college, how to like, wire up the whole dorm."
626.64,629.0," I think in fact, all are confused with each other."
629.0,631.4, Starcraft was all we did.
631.4,636.24," I played a lot of Starcraft at CGW with Elliott Chen, who used to work here and then ended"
636.24,638.9200000000001, up getting a job at Blizzard.
638.92,643.8, And he was great to play with because he was so great and I sucked so bad.
643.8,649.4," But he was great because he would kind of do the, you know, was that show kung fu, you know,"
649.4,654.24," with, with David Kaine and, you know, so he would kind of teach me after the mattress"
654.24,655.24, over.
655.24,656.24, You see grasshopper.
656.24,657.24," You know, so you have to snitch them out."
657.24,660.4799999999999," So, we need to create a barracks if you want to have any military units."
660.4799999999999,662.4799999999999, That's what we'll see.
662.4799999999999,664.48, It did help.
664.48,668.8399999999999," Yeah, actually because what he taught me a lot was like all the lame buck that I've"
668.9200000000001,675.72," stopped like, you know, the screwed tactics of people to, you know, just to be jerks online."
675.72,676.72, So that was good to know.
676.72,679.4, He would do it to me and I would just be you ass.
679.4,682.24," Like he, the first thing he would always do, it wouldn't matter what game was."
682.24,686.08, He would go over and he would like build shit around my resources.
686.08,687.76, Like he'd build towers if they had a lot of money.
687.76,688.76, That's what he got.
688.76,692.1600000000001," So I just couldn't ever like mine anything from the start and I would just go, okay,"
692.1600000000001,693.1600000000001," well, great."
693.1600000000001,696.08, I have 20 gold and I can't even build one unit now.
696.08,699.2," So I guess the game's over and he'd go, yep, that's right."
699.2,700.2, Games over.
700.2,701.2, What do you go learn Jeff?
701.2,703.2, You got to protect your resources.
703.2,705.2, It's like warcraft three.
705.2,708.84, Like people would just write over and with their hero and start killing your workers.
708.84,709.84, Right.
709.84,712.6800000000001," You know, who do you know, a good instructor if he actually took the time out, would"
712.6800000000001,714.1600000000001, do it was D?
714.1600000000001,715.1600000000001, Yeah.
715.1600000000001,718.12," I mean, when he was here, I remember him, like we would have like was it, was it rise of legends"
718.12,719.12, or rise of nations?
719.12,720.12, Things like rise of nations.
720.12,721.12," Oh, I was rising."
721.12,724.9200000000001, So we'd have these rise of nations like everyone on the staff would be playing against
725.0,725.8399999999999, against D.
725.8399999999999,726.8399999999999, Yeah.
726.8399999999999,729.0, So is D versus everyone he would beat everyone.
729.0,730.0, Yeah.
730.0,732.56, And we weren't bad at RTS is either.
732.56,737.5999999999999," I mean, we weren't great, but he was just like at that other sort of, you know,"
737.5999999999999,739.0, insane genius level.
739.0,742.76," Well, he's like, is he working for the government now?"
742.76,745.0799999999999," Yeah, he's pushing for a government agency now."
745.0799999999999,747.68, So we probably all we can say without getting killed.
747.68,748.68, It's exactly.
748.68,752.1999999999999, Because we found when we would play almost exclusively just among ourselves and
752.2,756.12," college, and you'd get really good among yourselves, then you'd have your own"
756.12,757.12, taxips.
757.12,760.48," As soon as you go online, everything you've learned among your friends is completely"
760.48,761.48, useless.
761.48,764.5200000000001," And I just like, wow, I feel like I really sucked despite the fact that I've been playing"
764.5200000000001,765.9200000000001, this for two years.
765.9200000000001,766.9200000000001, Would you?
766.9200000000001,767.9200000000001, And then everyone back.
767.9200000000001,771.4000000000001," So would you and your friends like have like the kind of gentlemen's agreement, like"
771.4000000000001,775.72," we're not going to rush or whatever, we're not going to do these three lame things."
775.72,776.72, Yeah.
776.72,777.72, Would you just do them anyway?
777.72,781.76," No, we mostly did mostly have the agreement."
782.72,787.04," Because we did at CGW, which is why that's what always happened to me going."
787.04,787.84," No, mine."
787.84,789.64," It just will be like, oh, okay."
789.64,793.68," I guess every lame tactic, it just opened here because people just want to win."
793.68,794.12, Right.
794.12,797.04," I mean, and I guess that's part of the rules."
797.04,798.08," Yeah, that's part of the rules."
798.08,798.4, Right.
798.4,800.28, It's cut using your street play and college.
800.28,801.28, You can play in a way.
801.28,803.12, Like you can complain about you throwing.
803.12,805.3199999999999, Like you don't put yourself in a position to be thrown.
805.3199999999999,805.68, Exactly.
805.68,806.4399999999999," Yeah, right."
806.4399999999999,808.52, There are a couple of these cheap moves.
808.52,808.88, Just got us.
808.88,811.52," What's kind of like, you know, John, remember joining the games on Battle"
811.52,813.12," and it would be like, no rushing."
813.12,814.76," And then, you know, everybody really rushing."
814.76,818.0, Did you join Noob's only games exactly?
818.0,819.16, And especially the new.
819.16,821.48," If you never join a service, this Noob's only is right."
821.48,823.12, That's the one lesson I learned from that era.
823.12,824.12, Yeah.
824.12,825.4399999999999, That's all the pro players are.
825.4399999999999,827.3199999999999," That's like, put in a giant kick me side of me."
827.3199999999999,828.3199999999999, Yeah.
828.3199999999999,828.84, Yeah.
828.84,829.68, We don't not apply either.
829.68,830.68, Yeah.
830.68,831.28, Yeah.
831.28,831.48, Yeah.
831.48,833.92," It's almost like during the, I made that mistake once again during the Halo,"
833.92,838.4399999999999," just not to go back to Halo 3 for too long, but I did that during the Bay of this."
838.4399999999999,839.4399999999999, That's going on.
839.44,844.5200000000001," I set up a Noob's only game and of course, I'm the new one there."
844.5200000000001,845.5200000000001," Of course, here the new."
845.5200000000001,846.5200000000001, Exactly.
846.5200000000001,847.5200000000001, Yeah.
847.5200000000001,848.5200000000001, I learned my lesson.
848.5200000000001,851.9200000000001," Actually in Starcraft way, way back then where I joined the game, just like that."
851.9200000000001,856.0400000000001, And it was supposedly two teams of two.
856.0400000000001,860.12," And basically, I mean, to spoil it before I tell the story, it was basically those three"
860.12,861.12, guys against me.
861.12,862.8800000000001, And I just didn't know it.
862.8800000000001,865.32," You know, so I had a quote unquote teammate."
865.32,868.72," And early on, he was like, oh, let me come over to your area and I'll like build shit."
868.72,870.4," Like, my friends and my friends, and done that."
870.4,875.72," He felt like, you know, whatever, you know, stuff to, he set all his guys up all around"
875.72,876.72, me.
876.72,880.28," And then at the exact moment, you know, that he was talking with other buddies, he just"
880.28,882.6800000000001, flipped the switch to an ally with me.
882.6800000000001,883.6800000000001, And I was dead.
883.6800000000001,884.6800000000001, Yeah.
884.6800000000001,886.6800000000001, He was he insurrounded by whole base and I was dead.
886.6800000000001,887.6800000000001, Yeah.
887.6800000000001,888.6800000000001, I backed up.
888.6800000000001,891.72," And I was just like cursing like you fucking in there just,"
891.72,892.72, LOL.
892.72,896.72," We don't think we said LOL back then, but didn't have that meme."
896.72,897.72, Yeah.
897.72,900.4, What was your starcraft race of choice?
900.4,901.4, It was Zerg.
901.4,902.4, Your reserve?
902.4,903.4, Yeah.
903.4,904.4, That was a pro tosser.
904.4,905.4, Where are you?
905.4,906.4, Oh yeah.
906.4,907.4, I have a totally bizer.
907.4,908.4, Humans were boring as hell.
908.4,910.4, Humans were always boring to me.
910.4,911.4, Every game is a human race.
911.4,912.4," And like, me."
912.4,913.4, Yeah.
913.4,916.0400000000001, I played them first just because they were the easiest.
916.0400000000001,917.64," Well, you're a good training tool."
917.64,920.0400000000001," Yeah, it was kind of like a utilite."
920.0400000000001,922.84," I either went, I went back and forth between Zerg and Protoss."
923.4,926.96," You know, actually, I got to jump back to, you know,"
926.96,928.44," you know, Starcraft 2 or something."
928.44,929.44, I'm wondering.
929.44,932.44," No, I got God forbid, but I'm just, I'll just go off topic."
932.44,935.8000000000001," Since then, I'm just, I got to think of this."
935.8000000000001,937.8000000000001," I mean, like, what is the impact of this,"
937.8000000000001,941.4," against a game like say, universe at war or any other like,"
941.4,942.4, Yeah.
942.4,943.4, That's a good question.
943.4,945.36, Is that going to like totally take the steam out of a couple of
945.36,946.36, other games out there that are?
946.36,948.6800000000001," Well, you got to wonder like the guys making our T.S."
948.6800000000001,951.2800000000001," Is everywhere else are, yeah, probably this week and we're like,"
951.2800000000001,952.2800000000001, Oh great.
952.64,953.48, Here we go.
953.48,953.9599999999999, Yeah.
953.9599999999999,954.64, Yeah.
954.64,956.72, Now that I'll try to adjust their ship dates.
956.72,957.0799999999999, So whatever.
957.0799999999999,959.88," Well, we're, had did they announce when it they didn't."
959.88,962.36," What's actually, I think it's a 2008."
962.36,963.48, Did they even say that?
963.48,965.64," I thought I read that online, so I'm going to what seemed kind of"
965.64,966.1999999999999, LOL.
966.1999999999999,969.4," I just, I didn't know if they had announced it in a release date."
969.4,972.0, I would have ignored it because what does that mean anymore?
972.0,972.72, Yeah.
972.72,977.8," However, they are showing a lot more footage early on than they normally do."
977.8,979.9599999999999," Well, this game has been, I mean, well, this game has been,"
980.12,982.5600000000001," work, they've been in development since what frozen thrown."
982.5600000000001,985.0," So yeah, I think they came out for craft three expedient."
985.0,986.0, That's crazy.
986.0,988.08, So these guys have been putting this thing together for some time.
988.08,990.12, I can imagine that they'd be ready for like 2008.
990.12,992.0," I just don't know, I went in 2000."
992.0,994.64," I think in a way, if I were one of the other RTSs,"
994.64,998.4000000000001," I would be kind of relieved that, OK, I knew Starcraft 2 was coming."
998.4000000000001,999.44, And here it is.
999.44,1001.52," And OK, it's a lot like Starcraft."
1001.52,1004.08," And they're, you know, they didn't, a lot of,"
1004.08,1008.1600000000001," because a lot of RTS people, you know, banked, banked on innovation and"
1008.16,1009.64, some right here before.
1009.64,1012.24," So like they can kind of say, hey, we have a USP here."
1012.24,1013.04, Right.
1013.04,1015.24," Oh, thank you."
1015.24,1016.24, Thank you for thanking for being able to bring that.
1016.24,1017.24, I've never been back to that.
1017.24,1018.88," It's like, oh, OK."
1018.88,1020.0799999999999, We're not even going to define it.
1020.0799999999999,1023.64," No, we just expect our loyal GFW readers to remember that."
1023.64,1024.48, Let us.
1024.48,1026.48," Let us readers, whatever, whatever."
1026.48,1028.08, USP.
1028.08,1028.6, Look it up.
1028.6,1033.76," Yeah, you know, if Sean was here, I'd be interesting to get his take."
1033.84,1040.52," Because, you know, his RTS experience is started with company fair."
1040.52,1041.52, Right.
1041.52,1046.08," And I mean, I heard him saying earlier that, yeah, it's the"
1046.08,1049.72," seemed from his perspective, like, too rigid."
1049.72,1051.92, Like he wasn't sure if he was going to be excited about it.
1051.92,1054.52," And I think the other thing is like, you think about it, like, you know,"
1054.52,1057.12," when you have a game like, you know, say counter strike, it comes out."
1057.12,1058.68, Everyone knows all the maps and knows how to play it and
1058.68,1059.84, knows the mechanics of it.
1059.84,1061.4, I kind of put Starcraft in that category.
1061.48,1064.48, It's been so scrutinized and so played for so much.
1064.48,1064.8400000000001, Right.
1064.8400000000001,1069.3200000000002," So I can only imagine like the day that Starcraft 2 comes out,"
1069.3200000000002,1071.5600000000002," already doesn't mean like grandmasters who, uh,"
1071.5600000000002,1072.92," well, it's going to be interesting."
1072.92,1074.76," I mean, I guess we're going to have to see like,"
1074.76,1077.1200000000001, is every unit getting tweets completely?
1077.1200000000001,1078.92," I mean, there's so much we don't know yet, right?"
1078.92,1079.92, Right.
1079.92,1081.92, We got to assume everything getting a little bit touched.
1081.92,1083.72," Because as soon as you add one unit,"
1083.72,1086.5600000000002, a two of mixed like that throws off all the other units.
1086.5600000000002,1090.2800000000002," Well, some don't end up nerfing things for for two years, too, right?"
1090.2800000000002,1090.8000000000002, Right.
1090.8,1092.04, There's still fix and Starcraft.
1092.04,1092.84, Right.
1092.84,1093.1599999999999, Right.
1093.1599999999999,1096.6399999999999, To a just a recent Starcraft patch that we're doing.
1096.6399999999999,1100.52," One thing that was, that got me really excited when I was watching it is,"
1100.52,1104.24," like, in the gameplay footage when the little portraits came up with the talking head."
1104.24,1104.76, Yeah.
1104.76,1106.3999999999999, Some reason I thought they looked so cool.
1106.3999999999999,1108.32," Well, they're really, they're like, the size of the screen."
1108.32,1109.44," They're like these, like, yeah."
1109.44,1110.48, There's the character design.
1110.48,1112.3999999999999," They're just like, that is a cool person."
1112.3999999999999,1113.04, Yeah.
1113.04,1114.04, I want to be him.
1114.04,1116.04, I want to be his friend.
1116.04,1116.56, Yeah.
1116.56,1117.76, My friend.
1117.76,1120.76," I also just sort of like that they kept that little, uh,"
1121.56,1122.32, that idea.
1122.32,1122.84," Oh, no."
1122.84,1125.84, I just thought that was kind of for like a better word cute.
1125.84,1128.16, The day with sounds really horrible.
1128.16,1128.52, Yeah.
1128.52,1130.36," But I just thought it was, I know."
1130.36,1131.36, It was also neat.
1131.36,1132.36, Yeah.
1132.36,1135.0," What's a fine way to convey, you know, starry and or tactics."
1135.0,1136.0, Right.
1136.0,1137.0, Right.
1137.0,1139.56," Having the bland females, always narrate with the box."
1139.56,1143.16," Well, it seems like they did it back in the original data,"
1143.16,1146.36," just because of the technical limitations, right?"
1146.36,1149.68," They just had these tiny windows with the game heads in them,"
1150.0,1150.8400000000001, talking to you.
1150.8400000000001,1154.5600000000002," Whereas now they could probably do something more cinematic or whatever,"
1154.5600000000002,1158.6000000000001, but it just seemed like they were just sort of retaining the flavor of the first one.
1159.6000000000001,1160.3600000000001, Kind of funny.
1160.3600000000001,1162.3200000000002, CNC three kind of banked success off.
1162.3200000000002,1165.68, I'm just kind of doing the same exact thing back in the day and nostalgia
1165.68,1166.48, factors.
1166.48,1167.0800000000002, Yeah.
1167.0800000000002,1167.8400000000001, People loved it.
1167.8400000000001,1168.48, Yeah.
1168.48,1170.0800000000002, Same things probably going to happen here.
1170.0800000000002,1170.88, Yeah.
1170.88,1174.0," I mean, I mean, obviously we're all going to play it."
1174.0,1175.0, I don't think there's hell.
1175.0,1176.0, Yeah.
1176.0,1177.0, It's been cool.
1177.0,1179.3200000000002, You see online all the people like saying they're going to go buy the first one
1179.32,1183.12, now and everyone's reinstalling it again and kind of neat.
1184.3999999999999,1185.08, You did it.
1185.08,1185.84, You reinstalled it.
1185.84,1186.2, You played.
1186.2,1186.8799999999999, I did.
1186.8799999999999,1187.96, I totally jumped on that.
1187.96,1188.32, I did.
1188.32,1191.72, I did dig out the Brudewar box that they got.
1191.72,1196.6799999999998," So honestly, I never finished Brudewar."
1196.6799999999998,1197.9199999999998, Really?
1197.9199999999998,1200.12," It's my dark, dark shame."
1200.12,1203.12," Well, I have shot and I have time to play before I got, I got far,"
1203.12,1205.24, but I actually think I got stuck.
1205.24,1205.96, It's hard.
1205.96,1206.8, Yeah.
1206.8,1208.6," Well, that's what I remember."
1208.6799999999998,1209.6, Not an easy thing.
1209.6,1213.8," Yeah, I think I was pretty far into it, but I just remember hitting one of those scenarios"
1213.8,1215.6," or is it like, I can't beat this."
1215.6,1216.6, Yeah.
1216.6,1218.76, Was it one of those time ones or exactly things at you?
1218.76,1219.76, Yeah.
1219.76,1222.28," At the last 30 seconds, right, you're like, oh, fine."
1222.28,1223.28, I beat it.
1223.28,1225.6399999999999, And then there comes the ball.
1225.6399999999999,1226.6399999999999, You clearly launched a test.
1231.1599999999999,1233.84, That enough starcraft never.
1233.84,1238.24," So Axe, I should say, we sent James"
1238.24,1246.68," Milky the great one up correspondent writer, DJ, all around good guy."
1246.68,1249.04, So he was at the event in Korea.
1249.04,1252.92, And he blogged about it if you haven't seen his blog on one of the.com.
1252.92,1256.36, And he's going to be writing something up for the magazine.
1256.36,1261.96, And hopefully we're going to get him on our podcast to talk about it itself because
1261.96,1267.24, a firsthand account of what it was like with the a lot better than listening to us.
1267.24,1268.08, Yes.
1268.08,1269.08, And our third hand account.
1269.08,1271.8799999999999, I think he's sleeping right now after his 23-hour flight back.
1271.8799999999999,1272.8799999999999, So he's just got back.
1272.8799999999999,1274.8799999999999, He just got just got back.
1274.8799999999999,1278.6799999999998," Not only is he sleeping while we record this, he'll probably still be sleeping when this"
1278.6799999999998,1279.6799999999998, is posted.
1279.6799999999998,1281.6799999999998," Yeah, we were trying to."
1281.6799999999998,1283.8, We were trying to get him to sit on this podcast.
1283.8,1286.9199999999998," And I think that what was the exact response was just like, no."
1286.9199999999998,1287.9199999999998," It's like, L-Ols."
1287.9199999999998,1288.9199999999998, L-Ols.
1288.9199999999998,1289.9199999999998, L-Ols.
1289.9199999999998,1290.9199999999998, And no.
1290.9199999999998,1291.9199999999998, Right one word.
1291.9199999999998,1292.9199999999998, L-Ols.
1292.9199999999998,1293.9199999999998, No.
1293.9199999999998,1294.9199999999998, And we gave him two choices.
1294.9199999999998,1296.9199999999998," And it was like, right double-wall."
1296.9199999999998,1297.9199999999998, No.
1297.92,1300.24," R-P-M today, 10 a.m."
1300.24,1301.96, The next day and neither.
1301.96,1305.24," So, but we understand James, you need to sleep."
1305.24,1306.24, I got to get to see.
1306.24,1307.24, No commitment.
1307.24,1308.24, That verky diagram.
1308.24,1309.64, Did you see his photo blog?
1309.64,1310.64, No.
1310.64,1312.48, Where he took pictures of the murky diagramma.
1312.48,1313.48," Oh, really?"
1313.48,1314.48, It was our Ols.
1314.48,1315.48, I need that.
1315.48,1318.0800000000002, I also need the big foil voidwalker balloons.
1318.0800000000002,1319.0800000000002," Oh, wow."
1319.0800000000002,1320.0800000000002, Foil voidwalker.
1320.0800000000002,1321.0800000000002, Yeah.
1321.0800000000002,1322.0800000000002, Brilliant.
1322.0800000000002,1323.0800000000002, Wow.
1323.0800000000002,1324.0800000000002, We're going to room for those in your apartment.
1324.0800000000002,1325.0800000000002, They're balloons.
1325.0800000000002,1327.04, That would be great to scare the shit out of kids.
1327.04,1329.08," Like a, you know, three-year-old birthday party."
1329.08,1331.08, I like some evil clown-woo voidwalker coming.
1331.08,1332.08, I am.
1332.08,1333.08, I am.
1333.08,1334.08, I am.
1334.08,1335.08, Mommy.
1335.08,1338.3999999999999, The balloons are scaring me.
1338.3999999999999,1341.28," So, we'll try to have milky in the podcast when he wakes up."
1341.28,1342.68, Maybe next week.
1342.68,1346.48," Unless it's all played out by then, and no one cares about Starcraft 2 anymore."
1346.48,1349.8," And maybe we'll have the scoop out of Warcraft Adventures, Lord of the Clans."
1349.8,1350.8," Oh, yeah."
1350.8,1351.8, Yeah.
1351.8,1355.68," I brought down the original Starcraft CD, which I dug out over the weekend."
1355.68,1360.3600000000001," Inside, coming in 1998, Warcraft Adventures, Lord of the Clans."
1360.3600000000001,1361.3600000000001," Ah, yes."
1361.3600000000001,1362.6000000000001," Ah, simpler times."
1362.6000000000001,1365.1200000000001, simpler times.
1365.1200000000001,1366.1200000000001, I was scared.
1366.1200000000001,1367.8400000000001, I like that one.
1367.8400000000001,1368.8400000000001, What?
1368.8400000000001,1370.8400000000001, Lord of the way that didn't come out.
1370.8400000000001,1371.8400000000001, Yeah.
1371.8400000000001,1372.8400000000001, Pooser.
1372.8400000000001,1373.8400000000001, I like all Blizzard games.
1373.8400000000001,1374.8400000000001," Yeah, I beat that one."
1374.8400000000001,1375.8400000000001, Yeah.
1375.8400000000001,1376.8400000000001, Okay.
1376.8400000000001,1382.04," So, that's enough of the Blizzard hour."
1382.04,1383.04, Or the Blizzard hour.
1383.04,1384.04, Or the Blizzard hour.
1384.04,1385.04, The Blizzard.
1385.04,1388.56," I think I'd wanted to do a big, sort of, PC gaming item this week."
1388.56,1391.12, Was the Half-Life 2 Black Box?
1391.12,1392.12, Yeah.
1392.12,1393.12," So, happened to here."
1393.12,1394.12," Oh, well, let me see."
1394.12,1398.24," The big announcement was they canceled the Black Box, which is basically just episode"
1398.24,1405.56," two Val with the whole portal and team fortress, too."
1405.56,1406.56, Yes.
1406.56,1407.56, Yes.
1407.56,1408.56, Okay.
1408.56,1412.72, My brain's a little bit just two portal and Half-Life 2 episode two all in the same
1412.72,1413.72, box.
1413.76,1417.64," So, they're going to be two version of that."
1417.64,1423.16," That, the Orange Box, which still exists, which is the $49 version, which also includes"
1423.16,1424.96, the two and episode one.
1424.96,1425.96, Yeah.
1425.96,1426.96, Exactly.
1426.96,1427.96," So, don't want to throw that other game, too."
1427.96,1428.96, Or am I mixing that up?
1428.96,1429.96, Left for dead is left for dead.
1429.96,1430.96, Left for dead is some else.
1430.96,1432.96, That's not part of either box.
1432.96,1433.96, Okay.
1433.96,1434.96, Not part of the box.
1434.96,1435.96," Yeah, they're all on that."
1435.96,1436.96, Damn it.
1436.96,1437.96," So, yeah."
1437.96,1442.24," So, basically, the idea was that basically they only have one box at retail."
1442.24,1445.48, And it's the box that has the full version of Half-Life.
1445.48,1447.0," The entire Half-Life run, basically."
1447.0,1448.0, Yeah.
1448.0,1451.24," Including, of course, some people are like, well, if this is episodic, how come I have"
1451.24,1454.92, to buy the old episodes again?
1454.92,1455.92, Yeah.
1455.92,1457.44, And they have a point there.
1457.44,1461.48, I don't know what prompted them to get rid of this skew.
1461.48,1466.8," Are they basically sort of without saying it, saying that it's not episodic anymore?"
1466.8,1468.52, I think they pretty much said that in the past.
1468.52,1471.36," And I could swear saying, by it on steam."
1471.36,1472.36, That's pretty much what they're saying.
1472.36,1473.36, Exactly.
1473.36,1474.36, Yeah.
1474.36,1476.12," If you want to buy it on retail, go ahead ahead or share it."
1476.12,1478.36," Basically, it's like, we're going ahead, share the codes for the first two gamers if"
1478.36,1479.36, you already have one of the buddy.
1479.36,1482.9199999999998," Yeah, that's for the Douglas Barrettie, the marketing director of Redwell."
1482.9199999999998,1485.9199999999998," His statement was pretty much like, well, you can just give it to a friend."
1485.9199999999998,1486.9199999999998, Okay.
1486.9199999999998,1487.9199999999998," So, they say they're saying, yeah."
1487.9199999999998,1491.9199999999998, We're going to make the retail version of Shitty is possible so that you buy the steam
1491.9199999999998,1492.9199999999998, version.
1492.9199999999998,1493.9199999999998, It's still like it.
1493.9199999999998,1494.9199999999998, It's still not Shitty is possible.
1494.9199999999998,1496.9199999999998," No, it's still a good deal no matter how you ask."
1496.9199999999998,1498.9199999999998," Yeah, even if 50 bucks, those three things are really good."
1498.9199999999998,1500.9199999999998, Do any of our friends not have Half-Life though?
1500.92,1501.92," I know, that's the thing."
1501.92,1504.92," It's just like, if you're thinking to buy it up, make a new friend."
1504.92,1507.0," I mean, I mean, it makes sense."
1507.0,1508.0, The bomb on the street.
1508.0,1509.0, Here you go.
1509.0,1514.96, Makes more sense on like the PS3 or something to have just the orange box because there
1514.96,1517.96, is no PS3 version of Half-Life.
1517.96,1519.72," But on the PC, yeah."
1519.72,1520.72, It's retail.
1520.72,1521.72," Retails dead, right?"
1521.72,1522.72, Right?
1522.72,1523.72, Yeah.
1523.72,1524.72, Right?
1524.72,1525.72, Yeah.
1525.72,1528.72," Wait, did you say you don't have Half-Life, Ryan?"
1528.72,1529.72, Right.
1529.72,1530.72, One or two?
1530.72,1531.72, Right.
1531.72,1533.72, Where are you?
1533.72,1535.72, There's so fired.
1535.72,1536.72, Wow.
1536.72,1537.72, Did I make a new one?
1537.72,1541.2," I mean, do that for your job application or something to then make you run through"
1541.2,1542.2, a level or something.
1542.2,1544.2, I need to solve the puzzles here.
1544.2,1545.2," Yeah, I don't think you need to."
1545.2,1546.2, Process that really.
1546.2,1548.2," Use the gravity gun, boy."
1548.2,1549.2, For how do you sense?
1549.2,1550.2, For how do you sense?
1550.2,1551.2, What do you think of gravity gun?
1551.2,1552.2, The Half-Life is fun.
1552.2,1553.2, You're hired.
1553.2,1557.4," No, I'm not into the shooters."
1557.4,1559.2," Yeah, but that's one year alike."
1559.2,1560.2, You can make an exception on that one.
1560.2,1561.68, That's what you got to play that.
1561.68,1565.2," It's sort of like even if you didn't like space-hims back in the day, you had to play"
1565.2,1567.4," wing commander, you know?"
1567.4,1568.4, High-finer.
1568.4,1569.4, You got to play Half-Life.
1569.4,1570.4," Play Half-Life, Ryan."
1570.4,1572.4," I like Ryan's in Thusbury, actually."
1572.4,1573.4, Yeah.
1573.4,1574.4, I haven't even tried it.
1574.4,1575.8, Did you play a level in God?
1575.8,1577.04, This is not for me.
1577.04,1580.72, I played Half-Life 2 before anybody here.
1580.72,1581.72, You did?
1581.72,1582.72, Yeah.
1582.72,1583.72, I stood in for you.
1583.72,1585.92," Actually, you stood in three demonstration."
1585.92,1586.92, That's right.
1586.92,1589.88, We totally lost on Ryan as he's trying to.
1589.96,1593.96," I played some, you're in a buggy."
1593.96,1594.96, Yeah.
1594.96,1596.68, I played through that part.
1596.68,1597.5600000000002, Where was I?
1597.5600000000002,1598.5600000000002, Picking minds on.
1598.5600000000002,1599.5600000000002, I like the past.
1599.5600000000002,1600.5600000000002," Oh, you know what?"
1600.5600000000002,1601.5600000000002, It was a pretty crazy thing.
1601.5600000000002,1603.16, You had Ryan go down for us.
1603.16,1604.68, I was your proxy judge.
1604.68,1605.68, Yeah.
1605.68,1606.68, Ah-ha.
1606.68,1607.68, And you do like it?
1607.68,1609.2800000000002, It was all right.
1609.2800000000002,1611.7600000000002," I'm more just wanted to come back and be like, ah, I have play I've like"
1611.7600000000002,1612.7600000000002, do for you guys to.
1612.7600000000002,1615.5600000000002, I don't even like these games.
1615.5600000000002,1616.5600000000002," You showed us, buddy."
1616.5600000000002,1617.5600000000002, Yeah.
1618.24,1620.32," I mean, you know, I've skipped."
1620.32,1622.9199999999998, I've played with a sticker.
1622.9199999999998,1626.36," I've watched Fringe play, you know, Half-Life 1 in Japan."
1626.36,1628.08," You know, I mean, they look good in all that."
1628.08,1630.52," But I mean, you're non-plust."
1630.52,1631.8, And it's not just things.
1631.8,1632.8," Yeah, that's okay."
1632.8,1634.3999999999999, I played well.
1634.3999999999999,1635.3999999999999, I played well.
1635.3999999999999,1635.76, I played well.
1635.76,1636.76, I played well.
1636.76,1637.96," And Stein and Doom 1 and 2, those were okay."
1637.96,1638.96, Okay.
1638.96,1640.9199999999998, But you have some credibility.
1640.9199999999998,1641.6, Yeah.
1641.6,1643.0, So you're not going to buy the black bar.
1643.0,1644.2, They're orange box though.
1644.2,1645.0, No.
1645.0,1646.52," You know, there's some portal or team for it."
1646.52,1647.52, No.
1647.6,1651.0," So if I just want a team for your looks, pretty cool."
1651.0,1651.6399999999999, Team for you.
1651.6399999999999,1652.48, It's awesome.
1652.48,1656.32," But if I just want that, I mean, basically, I got to get a"
1656.32,1657.32," scheme, right?"
1657.32,1659.12," If I don't want the other things, that's my own way."
1659.12,1659.84, That's pretty much it.
1659.84,1663.4, You can't just go buy a team team for just two to be honest with you.
1663.4,1666.16," I can't even imagine why anybody, like here, you know,"
1666.16,1668.96," listening to this podcast, even is going to want to like get the retail version."
1668.96,1669.56, Yeah.
1669.56,1673.16," It just seems, it just seems totally as an I'm people like the retail."
1673.16,1673.6, Dead.
1673.6,1674.6," People like their, uh,"
1674.6799999999998,1675.4399999999998, to hold.
1675.4399999999998,1678.6399999999999, I'm making some sort of gesture with my hands to say what Ryan is.
1678.6399999999999,1679.6399999999999, That doesn't work.
1679.6399999999999,1680.6399999999999, It's not really.
1680.6399999999999,1681.6399999999999, Yeah.
1681.6399999999999,1683.04, People like tactile sensation.
1683.04,1683.6399999999999, I guess so.
1683.6399999999999,1685.12, But I just couldn't open a show.
1685.12,1688.9599999999998," But I just keep thinking about like one, like one half life to, you know,"
1688.9599999999998,1690.32, the original half life took him out.
1690.32,1692.6399999999999," Okay, forget the whole like steam installation nonsense."
1692.6399999999999,1695.6799999999998," But if you ever want to play the game, not only will you have to like put the"
1695.6799999999998,1697.7199999999998," disk in, you'll probably have to go through steam authentication."
1697.7199999999998,1699.08, So it's like double the whammy.
1699.08,1699.6, Yeah.
1699.6,1702.3999999999999," As opposed to being anywhere at a friend of friends,"
1702.4,1705.48, place you want to you feel like you're your Joseph for effects and you just download it.
1705.48,1706.48, And it's on your account.
1707.2800000000002,1707.64, I do.
1707.64,1708.6000000000001, What's the steam now?
1708.6000000000001,1709.2, I do.
1709.4,1710.76, I was a big hater back in the day.
1710.76,1715.3600000000001," Well, we all work as a cause that initial like ramp up was a train wreck, but now they fix"
1715.3600000000001,1716.88, they fixed everything and now it's they got a great.
1716.88,1717.5600000000002, That's that stuff.
1717.5600000000002,1721.4," All great about steam, but like, you know, there is still something to the collecting."
1722.1200000000001,1722.4, Yeah.
1722.4,1723.88, Things that you put on your shelf.
1723.88,1726.96, So you're the special collectors box with a head crab in it.
1726.96,1728.3600000000001," But yeah, a plush head crammer."
1728.3600000000001,1729.92," They're collectors, additions and good."
1729.92,1732.3600000000001, We're just mainly because my house is.
1732.36,1733.36, Do cluttered.
1733.36,1736.6399999999999," You know, I just don't need more game boxes in the house anymore."
1736.6399999999999,1738.9599999999998, I'm feeling that way with my music CDs too.
1738.9599999999998,1744.7199999999998," So, so I guess we could, can it wait?"
1744.7199999999998,1746.9599999999998," Sorry, Ryan's passing a note around here."
1746.9599999999998,1748.36, To take break.
1748.36,1749.36," Yeah, let's take a break."
1749.36,1751.36, And we're discuss amongst ourselves.
1751.36,1753.36, Ryan's secret missiles.
1753.36,1755.36, He loved the find out about it.
1755.36,1756.36, Maybe we'll be back.
1756.36,1757.9599999999998, I'd have to read it to the rest of the class.
1758.9599999999998,1762.24, This one up podcast is brought to you by Halo 2 for the PC.

1795.8400000000001,1797.24," Well, we're going to get to it."
1797.24,1802.64," But first, Darren has this exciting information about the next day's X game."
1802.64,1803.64," Hey, take it away."
1803.64,1804.64, Darren.
1806.64,1808.64," So, then hey."
1808.64,1812.64," No, actually, I don't know if you guys were fans of the,"
1812.64,1814.24, did you like the last day's X game?
1814.24,1815.44, I didn't play two.
1815.44,1816.44, I played one.
1816.44,1817.24, I like two.
1817.24,1818.24, I like two as well.
1818.24,1819.24, And play shooters.
1819.24,1820.24, It was flawed.
1820.24,1821.44," Yeah, yes, we know."
1821.44,1823.44," In all its quirky charm, shut up, Ryan."
1823.44,1824.04, We don't care.
1824.04,1824.64, Give a shit.
1824.64,1827.64, Why does that have to do to had a battery petition now?
1827.64,1829.44," Well, it was ambitious and didn't."
1829.44,1830.24, It felt short.
1830.24,1832.44, It didn't do what it was trying to do.
1832.44,1834.64, But I could still admire it for trying.
1834.64,1835.64, Okay.
1835.64,1836.64, Right.
1836.64,1840.44," So anyway, I guess we're got out there recently through a,"
1840.44,1842.64, I don't know which European site kind of put it out there.
1842.64,1844.64, Apparently there's another DSX game in the works.
1844.64,1847.24," It's always the Europeans, man."
1847.24,1848.64, They got big mouths over there.
1848.64,1850.24, They blow every story.
1850.24,1850.44, They got a story.
1850.44,1851.44, They got a story.
1851.44,1852.44, They do.
1852.44,1854.8400000000001," So, you know, actually, so I, I'm kind of curious."
1854.8400000000001,1857.8400000000001," I mean, like, is Warren Spectre even attached to this?"
1857.8400000000001,1862.24, Is it Crystal Dynamics that did a project snow blind game that was kind of inspired
1862.24,1864.24, by the DSX universe?
1864.24,1868.24," I talked to, I talked to people over there in the official word for now is nothing."
1868.24,1870.64," There is, there is nothing to talk about."
1870.64,1873.44," And if there is, well, no soon enough."
1873.44,1876.44, But so the official word isn't that there is no game.
1876.44,1877.44, What the?
1877.44,1878.44, Is there?
1878.44,1879.44, Just said.
1879.44,1881.76," Well, it's kind of like, they don't, I mean, basically, they don't even know where"
1881.76,1883.44, this rumor came from.
1883.44,1884.44, Oh.
1884.44,1888.04," And so, like, you know, basically, the big question is, is this game even a reality period?"
1888.04,1890.44," So, that's the million dollar question."
1890.44,1893.76," And this is like, from inside, I'm getting this response from people inside, I"
1893.76,1894.76, ask.
1894.76,1895.76," So, yeah."
1895.76,1896.76, Yeah.
1896.76,1897.76, It's a French-American.
1897.76,1898.76, It's a French-American.
1898.76,1900.76, It's a French-I.
1900.76,1903.76," Maybe a bit tainted, slightly."
1903.76,1905.76," But, no, let's go back."
1905.76,1906.76, Let's go.
1906.76,1908.4, It could come back.
1908.4,1913.4," What I'd like to see though, we could, actually, we could all play a little spontaneous"
1913.4,1914.4, round of this.
1914.4,1915.4, Okay.
1915.4,1916.4, Okay.
1916.4,1917.4, What?
1917.4,1918.4, The sequel you'd like to see.
1918.4,1919.4, What I would like to see.
1919.4,1920.4, And Nacternox II.
1920.4,1921.4, Yes.
1921.4,1922.4, Absolutely.
1922.4,1923.4," Or just, you know, that's true."
1923.4,1926.4," Yeah, that was because that game was so awesome."
1926.4,1930.4," And it was like supposed to, you know, they split it in half."
1930.4,1933.4, Tom Hall had it because he was over ambitious.
1933.4,1935.4, They had to split the story in half.
1935.4,1938.4, So it practically ends on a cliffhanger.
1938.4,1941.4," It was as if, you know, Star Wars ended at Empire."
1941.4,1943.4, And you know what the cool thing was?
1943.4,1946.8000000000002," The way it was designed was that the moderns could openly come, because the whole part of the"
1946.8000000000002,1951.3600000000001," game is that you could just travel from one theme, which themed world to the next."
1951.3600000000001,1954.0," And the way the engine was worked out, people were able to just create their own worlds"
1954.0,1956.0, and plug it into the system.
1956.0,1958.0," And, man, I was a beautifully funny game."
1958.0,1960.0," Yeah, it was really well done."
1960.0,1961.0, Yeah.
1961.0,1962.64, It was kind of inspired by a chronitrigger in those kind of game.
1962.64,1963.64, Yeah.
1963.64,1964.64, And brought to the PC.
1964.64,1967.64," Final, the final glory of Ironstorm."
1967.64,1968.64, Mm-hmm.
1968.64,1969.64, Was that in Deus Ex?
1969.64,1970.64, And then there was it.
1970.64,1971.64, Yeah.
1971.64,1972.64, And I can tell.
1972.64,1973.64, Right.
1973.64,1974.64, Yeah.
1974.64,1975.64, Yeah.
1975.64,1976.64, Anybody else?
1976.64,1977.64, I think I'm there.
1977.64,1979.64," Yeah, I'd put it on the spot there."
1979.64,1980.64, Ryan is pointing his finger up.
1980.64,1981.64, Is he's raising his hand?
1981.64,1982.64, Yes.
1982.64,1984.64, The class calls upon Ryan.
1984.64,1985.64, Beyond good and evil.
1985.64,1986.64, Oh.
1986.64,1987.64, Yes.
1987.64,1988.64, Yeah.
1988.64,1989.64, That's a good one.
1989.64,1991.64," You know, when they ended on a cliffhanger."
1991.64,1993.64, I'd never made it to the end of that.
1993.64,1994.64, That is it for me.
1994.64,1998.64," That is one of those games that is like, everyone in the media is like, oh,"
1998.64,2000.64, Beyond good and evil.
2000.64,2001.64, Oh my god.
2001.64,2002.64, I can't believe this takes a bit.
2002.64,2003.64, That's all right.
2003.64,2004.64, Yeah.
2004.64,2006.64," It just, it didn't play out of the water."
2006.64,2008.64, I think that's one of those overrated games for me.
2008.64,2010.64, It would be on my overrated list.
2010.64,2011.64, Really?
2011.64,2013.64," I thought the, I thought the art director was all over the place."
2013.64,2014.64, And I like the Rayman games.
2014.64,2015.64, Okay.
2015.64,2016.64, I was a fan of previous Rayman games.
2016.64,2017.64, So I like his work.
2017.64,2018.64, Okay.
2018.64,2019.64, But.
2019.64,2020.64, I don't know.
2020.64,2021.64, But it didn't.
2021.64,2023.64, I think they were just not working for me.
2023.64,2024.64, Really?
2024.64,2025.64, Yeah.
2025.64,2029.64, Maybe I was a victim of hype.
2029.64,2032.64, Maybe I'm going to mean like that was too much hype before you got to it.
2032.64,2034.64," And then yeah, that might be it."
2034.64,2035.64," And there's like, okay."
2035.64,2036.64, I don't know what this is all about.
2036.64,2038.64," Like, second knots for me."
2038.64,2039.64, That was great.
2039.64,2042.64, Because I'd have the similar like critical ramp up.
2042.64,2045.64, And that is a game I would like to see a sequel for that probably will never have a sequel.
2045.64,2046.64, Yeah.
2046.64,2048.6400000000003," That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, like a modern classic."
2048.6400000000003,2049.6400000000003, It's just not going to.
2050.64,2051.64, Psychonauts.
2051.64,2052.64, Yeah.
2052.64,2053.64, I was a fun fun game.
2053.64,2055.64, And the damn shame is a critical success.
2055.64,2059.64," And then like on the store shelves, nothing like O'Commy."
2059.64,2061.64," Oh, there you go."
2061.64,2063.64, Sorry.
2063.64,2065.64, Sorry to see your choice is stupid.
2065.64,2067.64, And you're still.
2067.64,2068.64, Okay.
2068.64,2070.64, I have a maniac mansion.
2070.64,2071.64, Okay.
2071.64,2072.64, Okay.
2072.64,2073.64, So the conceptual.
2073.64,2074.64," Well, many."
2074.64,2075.64, Yeah.
2075.64,2076.64, I'm kind of torn.
2076.64,2078.64," I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to think of like the first three things that came to"
2078.64,2080.64," I, I couldn't think of one single game."
2080.64,2081.64, Hmm.
2081.64,2082.64, Plainscape torment.
2082.64,2083.64, I would love to see a sequel to that.
2083.64,2086.64," That was, that was one of my favorite RPGs."
2086.64,2087.64, That was awesome.
2087.64,2088.64, That's awesome.
2088.64,2089.64, That's awesome.
2089.64,2090.64, That's awesome.
2090.64,2091.64, That's awesome.
2091.64,2093.64, So one of my favorite RPGs of all time.
2093.64,2094.64, Yep.
2094.64,2095.64, Let me see that.
2095.64,2096.64, And then the full throttle.
2096.64,2097.64," Oh, God."
2097.64,2098.64, They tried.
2098.64,2099.64, They did try.
2099.64,2100.64, They did try.
2100.64,2101.64, That close.
2101.64,2102.64, And then thank God.
2102.64,2103.64, They canceled it.
2103.64,2104.64, Yeah.
2104.64,2105.64, That looks pretty hard.
2105.64,2106.64, Did you come up with me on that trip?
2106.64,2107.64, I did.
2107.64,2108.64, I did.
2108.64,2109.64, That looks good.
2109.64,2110.64, That's going to be funny.
2110.64,2111.64, What do you guys think?
2111.64,2113.64," It's an action game, right?"
2113.64,2114.64, It's like Grand Theft Auto.
2114.64,2116.64," Oh, I'm both, huh?"
2116.64,2120.64," And then, then, then, one for the obscure ones out there for people who've never even heard"
2120.64,2121.64, probably auto dual.
2121.64,2122.64, I have a maraudable.
2122.64,2124.64, Basically auto dual with a new.
2124.64,2125.64, That's true.
2125.64,2127.64, Not by much.
2127.64,2132.64," No, but, uh, auto assault was kind of a sequel, but not really well done."
2132.64,2134.64," A proper, a proper game like that done today."
2134.64,2135.64," I would, I would love that."
2136.64,2138.64," A proper car PG, I guess."
2138.64,2142.64," That action makes me think, I mean, this came up at the other week, but a real sequel to"
2142.64,2143.64, Interstate 76.
2143.64,2144.64, Totally.
2144.64,2146.64, That was not interstate 82.
2146.64,2147.64, Mm-hmm.
2147.64,2149.64," Let's just, let's do like the Highlander 2 treatment."
2149.64,2150.64, Pretend that never happened.
2150.64,2151.64, Yeah.
2151.64,2152.64, There's a lot of data to exist.
2152.64,2153.64," Well, we're getting fall out three, right?"
2153.64,2154.64, So that'll be exciting.
2154.64,2155.64," Oh, yeah."
2155.64,2156.64, Yeah.
2156.64,2157.64, Come back.
2157.64,2158.64, Looking forward to checking that out.
2158.64,2159.64, Psyched for that one.
2159.64,2160.64, That's probably a sequel.
2160.64,2162.64, I thought was never going to happen.
2162.64,2163.64, Yeah.
2163.64,2166.64, That's saga was such that it was going to go away forever.
2166.64,2169.64," If you look online, they still had like, I mean, apparently black aisle was pretty"
2169.64,2171.64, far along with fall out three.
2171.64,2174.64," And if you look online, there's actually, they have like video clips from that code."
2174.64,2175.64, Wow.
2175.64,2177.64, And it just kind of got thrown out.
2177.64,2179.64, Wow.
2179.64,2181.64," Jepley fall up there, right?"
2181.64,2186.64," Did that fall under your, uh, qualifications for you now play RPG either?"
2186.64,2187.64, Yeah.
2187.64,2188.64, You play on the player.
2188.64,2189.64, You know what?
2189.64,2190.64, You're not a gamer.
2190.64,2191.64, Get out.
2191.64,2195.64, I've tried to fall out the following games that I never got into.
2195.64,2198.64, I've tried in the past to play games like Baldur's Gage.
2198.64,2199.64, I can do.
2199.64,2201.64, Western Western.
2201.64,2202.64, Western.
2202.64,2203.64, He did.
2203.64,2206.64, Western RPG is just like never do it for me.
2206.64,2207.64, Wow.
2207.64,2210.64," I'm like, so like, my solar RPGs do."
2210.64,2211.64, Yeah.
2211.64,2212.64," So basically you need some like,"
2212.64,2213.64, Busty Catwoman.
2213.64,2214.64, She's more realistic.
2214.64,2215.64," Yes, Darren."
2215.64,2216.64, That's exactly what I do.
2216.64,2217.64, We got a trade-up.
2217.64,2219.64, We got a trade-rion straight up for an EGM editor.
2219.64,2221.64," You're like, you're like a console guy."
2221.64,2222.64, What the hell?
2222.64,2223.64, I play my own.
2223.64,2225.64, I'm gonna raise a get you off.
2225.64,2226.64, Vote you off the island now.
2226.64,2228.64, I play more PC games than anything.
2228.64,2229.64," No, you do."
2229.64,2230.64, This is true.
2230.64,2232.64," Well, you're, you're a member of like 8 MMOs at once right now."
2232.64,2233.64, I am.
2233.64,2234.64," Yeah, you are."
2234.64,2236.64, You are kind of your own legendary thread.
2236.64,2237.64, All in one.
2237.64,2238.64," Oh, one man."
2238.64,2239.64, I ain't got podcast.
2239.64,2242.64," So what are, what are all your MMOs?"
2242.64,2244.64, You're now a subscriber too.
2244.64,2245.64," Oh, my god."
2245.64,2246.64, Okay.
2246.64,2247.64, City here is.
2247.64,2248.64, You still?
2248.64,2250.64," Well, he actually just signed up again at today."
2250.64,2252.64, I've been playing City of films all weekend.
2252.64,2255.64," Anyway, explain why, though."
2255.64,2257.64, I made a mastermind character.
2257.64,2259.64," No, no, you wanted to, he wanted to recreate"
2259.64,2260.64, Doc Magnus in the middle.
2260.64,2262.64, I was inspired by DC's Doc Magnus.
2262.64,2265.64, So I made a mastermind robot.
2265.64,2266.64, Wow.
2266.64,2269.64," And it actually like,"
2269.64,2270.64, You're back on the show.
2270.64,2271.64, Yeah.
2271.64,2272.64, That's so geek.
2272.64,2273.64, I'm saving him.
2273.64,2275.64, You revived your cred.
2275.64,2277.64," No, it actually the game's the whole lot more."
2277.64,2279.64, Fun that way than was my previous character.
2279.64,2280.64," But anyway, okay."
2280.64,2281.64, So you hear us.
2281.64,2283.64, World of Warcraft.
2283.64,2285.64, Florida rings online.
2285.64,2287.64, Ultima online.
2287.64,2289.64, If you consider that I play on freeshards.
2289.64,2290.64, Okay.
2290.64,2292.64, Are you actually playing all these games?
2292.64,2293.64, Um.
2293.64,2294.64, Um.
2294.64,2296.64, You're not just subscribing and that'll log in.
2296.64,2299.64, I have played all four of these games within the last two weeks.
2299.64,2300.64, Man.
2300.64,2304.64," Except for, wow, I was going to play, but I need to renew my subscription."
2305.64,2306.64, I like that game.
2306.64,2307.64, Yes.
2307.64,2308.64, We know.
2308.64,2309.64, Uh.
2309.64,2310.64, Um.
2310.64,2312.64, Guild Wars.
2312.64,2313.64, Uh.
2313.64,2314.64, I'm on a raid.
2314.64,2315.64, It's from that right now.
2315.64,2316.64, Even on line.
2316.64,2318.64, You're character still evolving as you.
2318.64,2319.64, Oh yeah.
2319.64,2320.64, You must have leveled up a lot of things.
2320.64,2321.64, Right now.
2321.64,2322.64, Um.
2322.64,2324.64, And then I have accounts on these games.
2324.64,2326.64, But I don't actually play in the shadow being in Star Wars Galaxy.
2326.64,2327.64, Shadow being.
2327.64,2329.64, You have a shadow being a totally crap.
2329.64,2330.64, Wow.
2330.64,2331.64, But hell.
2331.64,2333.64, Is anyone on your server with you?
2333.64,2336.64, Or is it just like a single player game as a red has Ragnarac happening?
2336.64,2337.64, You're just going to like wandering around alone.
2337.64,2340.64, I haven't logged into that game for a good long while.
2340.64,2342.64, I lot the last time I tried to log in.
2342.64,2344.64," It was just like, how did I have played this?"
2344.64,2345.64, You know.
2345.64,2347.64, You've also said you have a Star Wars.
2347.64,2348.64, Yeah.
2348.64,2349.64, You do.
2349.64,2350.64, I think I do.
2350.64,2351.64, I have an account.
2351.64,2352.64, Yeah.
2352.64,2353.64, I did too.
2353.64,2355.64, I have a paid one to keep showing up on my bill.
2355.64,2356.64, It's still what?
2356.64,2357.64, Which is.
2357.64,2358.64, It's not crazy.
2358.64,2359.64, And a little bit of that to it.
2359.64,2361.64, What are you complaining about this when like I started.
2361.64,2362.64, I started.
2362.64,2363.64, I tried that.
2363.64,2366.64, We tried that in our down like we got we were on a wall.
2366.64,2367.64, Wow.
2367.64,2368.64, Break.
2368.64,2369.64, Yeah.
2369.64,2370.64, I'll take a break.
2370.64,2371.64," Well, let's try some of these other ones."
2371.64,2372.64, Lesson like four days.
2372.64,2373.64," We're like, this is cool."
2373.64,2374.64, Right.
2374.64,2375.64, Yeah.
2375.64,2376.64, I can never get into.
2376.64,2378.64, How far did you guys get into Galaxy?
2378.64,2381.64, So I can never get past anything in that game.
2381.64,2384.64, It was just so awful to me from the start.
2384.64,2385.64, Both times.
2385.64,2387.64, It was weird.
2387.64,2389.64, Because we were playing when we were at Rd exploded.
2389.64,2392.64," Like, they're in like, really all these like horrifying ghost towns."
2392.64,2395.64, That all these players had built in the band and it's just these automaton's left.
2395.64,2398.64, They're plotting these where it's doing this.
2398.64,2400.64," Like, come by my rivets."
2400.64,2403.64," We walk over and it's just some robot going, come by my rivets."
2403.64,2405.64, We're open for rivets.
2405.64,2407.64, Can you take over the guys ghost town?
2407.64,2408.64, Can you like squat in there?
2408.64,2410.64, Dirt tower or something.
2410.64,2411.64, And yeah.
2411.64,2412.64, Scary.
2412.64,2413.64, Yeah.
2413.64,2414.64, Then we stopped.
2414.64,2416.64, That sounds cool in his own game.
2416.64,2417.64, It was kind of cool.
2417.64,2418.64, And then a creepy way.
2418.64,2422.64, But then like when you realize that just the whole world was wiped out in some mysterious
2422.64,2423.64, cataclysm.
2423.64,2424.64, That's so weird.
2424.64,2425.64, So that's what I'm talking about.
2425.64,2426.64, You should know that.
2426.64,2427.64, You should know that's what some cult suck.
2427.64,2429.64," You know, that's a story."
2429.64,2430.64, Yeah.
2430.64,2432.64," Like, kind of like he'll make a man wandering around every ever."
2432.64,2433.64, Right.
2433.64,2434.64, Yeah.
2434.64,2435.64, It was fun.
2435.64,2436.64, It was fun.
2436.64,2437.64, Not that regard for a little while.
2437.64,2438.64, I don't think it's just so far.
2438.64,2439.64, I'm going to say it way.
2439.64,2440.64, Yeah.
2440.64,2441.64, Someone built this.
2441.64,2443.64, Someone was a toilet crafter.
2443.64,2445.64, It crafted this very toilet.
2448.64,2453.64," Speaking of which, that could segue out into Vanguard."
2453.64,2454.64, Wow.
2454.64,2457.64, There's an animal I don't play.
2457.64,2458.64, Wow.
2458.64,2461.64," You play eight MMOs, including Shadowbane."
2461.64,2462.64, But not Vanguard.
2462.64,2463.64, I'm subscribed to eight animals.
2463.64,2467.64," Hey, the only reason I have an active Shadowbane account is because it's free to play."
2467.64,2468.64, I don't actually have to pay.
2468.64,2469.64," No, you don't pay for it anymore."
2469.64,2470.64, It'll finish the Ryan.
2470.64,2474.64, I think one of the reasons why he might not be playing is that his machine probably can't
2474.64,2475.64, run it.
2475.64,2477.64," I mean, there's so I mean, like, I have like a shadowbane."
2477.64,2478.64," No, no, no, Vanguard."
2478.64,2479.64, Yeah.
2479.64,2480.64, Yeah.
2480.64,2481.64, I think it's a base of.
2481.64,2482.64, He needs a new machine.
2482.64,2483.64," Why, you need to upgrade quick."
2483.64,2484.64, No.
2484.64,2486.64, So I have hair as.
2486.64,2488.64, So I got a hard drive crash.
2488.64,2490.64, His that thing is I'm was a mess.
2490.64,2495.64," And I have like, I'd say, like amongst us here, I probably have a highest powered"
2495.64,2496.64, machine.
2496.64,2498.64, And it's in still ones in slow motion.
2498.64,2499.64, Vanguard.
2499.64,2500.64, Yep.
2500.64,2501.64, Maybe that's because it sucks.
2501.64,2502.64, And it was broken and shouldn't have come out when it did.
2502.64,2504.64," How do you really feel, right?"
2504.64,2507.64," Yeah, I tried to install it home twice."
2507.64,2511.64, I have an 8800 to use RAM.
2511.64,2515.64," My processor, not the fastest in the world, but not a dog either."
2515.64,2517.64, And it could not run Vanguard.
2517.64,2520.64, It's going to look like a six gig install.
2520.64,2522.64, Might even be more actually.
2522.64,2523.64, That's the same thing.
2523.64,2525.64, I think it's like a 10 gig install.
2525.64,2527.64," So anyway, we didn't talk about the news."
2527.64,2529.64, I guess because it's kind of old news.
2529.64,2531.64," Well, the point of this podcast."
2531.64,2537.64," Yeah, it was I think it all went down basically before we did our podcast last week."
2537.64,2539.64," Oh, yeah, right about."
2539.64,2540.64, Uh-huh.
2540.64,2543.64," Actually, as we were podcasting last week, everyone was getting laid off or fired."
2543.64,2544.64, We're really calling it.
2544.64,2545.64, Right.
2545.64,2547.64, So we don't know a whole lot more than we did that day.
2547.64,2548.64, Right.
2548.64,2550.64," Sony, Sony absorbed."
2550.64,2551.64, SIGIL.
2551.64,2552.64, Mm-hmm.
2552.64,2553.64, Late off.
2553.64,2557.64, A good number of its employees hired a bunch of their others.
2557.64,2558.64, Brad McQuay.
2558.64,2563.64, Apparently now has some kind of like nebulous outside advisory role.
2563.64,2564.64, Special projects.
2564.64,2565.64, Whatever that means.
2565.64,2567.64," Yeah, sounds like special projects to me."
2567.64,2568.64, We'll call you.
2568.64,2569.64, Hang tight.
2569.64,2570.64, Yeah.
2570.64,2573.64," Well, yeah, right back to you with some important questions, Brad."
2573.64,2575.64," Yeah, you just sit by the phone."
2575.64,2576.64, You're just a little bit.
2576.64,2577.64, So that can be a good product.
2577.64,2578.64, Okay.
2578.64,2579.64, I'll go.
2579.64,2580.64, Hang out.
2580.64,2581.64, I'll be playing.
2581.64,2582.64, Wow.
2582.64,2583.64, Yeah.
2583.64,2585.64, I have any questions about my shitty game bank.
2585.64,2586.64, Oh.
2586.64,2587.64, There you had to go.
2587.64,2588.64, I had to do that.
2588.64,2598.64," So yeah, actually say there's been a bunch of reports up online and a bunch of bloggers have had their various interviews and things and some juicy dirt there."
2598.64,2599.64, Whether it's true or not.
2599.64,2600.64, Yeah.
2600.64,2601.64, Very juicy.
2601.64,2606.64," And they're in the highest of which we could run stories like that, but we got to follow the old reporting rule."
2606.64,2607.64, Right.
2607.64,2608.64, So we're.
2608.64,2610.64, We may or may not be doing some done one.
2610.64,2612.64, We'll see with that.
2612.64,2615.64," We're conducting interviews, but we have to do it the proper way."
2615.64,2620.64, So investigations are forthcoming or not or not.
2620.64,2622.64, We'll see where the investigations take us.
2622.64,2625.64," If they take us somewhere interesting, we were report back."
2625.64,2630.64," Otherwise, we may just let that dead fish float to the top of the water and sail away."
2630.64,2633.64, To happier show us.
2633.64,2636.64, That was my favorite quest.
2636.64,2638.64, Okay.
2638.64,2639.64, Yeah.
2639.64,2641.64, I'm glad we brought that up.
2641.64,2642.64, Yeah.
2642.64,2643.64, Yeah.
2643.64,2644.64, It's kind of a grim topic.
2644.64,2647.64," Well, here's hope in the Vanguard C's better days."
2647.64,2648.64, Here here.
2648.64,2650.64, Maybe so we will do something good with it.
2650.64,2651.64, Yeah.
2651.64,2652.64, Yeah.
2652.64,2654.64, Wow.
2654.64,2655.64, Hahaha.
2655.64,2656.64, Hahaha.
2656.64,2658.64, Hahaha.
2658.64,2660.64, Put it on its misery.
2660.64,2662.64, No eyes were rolled in this segment.
2662.64,2663.64, No.
2663.64,2664.64, Not a warning.
2664.64,2665.64, Wow.
2665.64,2666.64, Oh.
2666.64,2667.64, Oh.
2667.64,2668.64, Him.
2668.64,2669.64, Alice.
2669.64,2670.64, So we're off room in here.
2670.64,2672.64, Do we have anything else to talk about today?
2673.64,2676.64," I, we didn't say this at all as we've been podcasting here."
2676.64,2680.64," The four of us, but we are on a very tight deadline today."
2680.64,2684.64," Once a month as we brought up before on this podcast,"
2684.64,2687.64, we actually do have to get a magazine out the door.
2687.64,2690.64, This would be one of those times of the month.
2690.64,2694.64," So, uh, forgiveness as we are probably going to cut it short."
2694.64,2695.64, Really soon.
2695.64,2696.64," Oh, you're pointing to my socks."
2696.64,2697.64, Yes.
2697.64,2698.64," Thank you, Darren."
2698.64,2699.64, Except I forgot to bring down the guy's name.
2699.64,2701.64," Oh, you're going to have to do it next week."
2702.64,2703.64, Oh.
2703.64,2704.64, Yeah.
2704.64,2706.64," But those who, uh, saw, it was on your blog."
2706.64,2708.64," Well, so, I actually put it up on the GFW radio blog."
2708.64,2710.64," Oh, so you're so more, so even more,"
2710.64,2711.64, people could see it.
2711.64,2712.64, Yeah.
2712.64,2715.64, But my holy socks became a part of the internet.
2715.64,2716.64, That's right.
2716.64,2717.64, There's a couple of things.
2717.64,2719.64, It was a running gag for like three weeks.
2719.64,2722.64," Every time during your podcast, you take off your sneakers."
2722.64,2724.64, And I'd be staring at your bunions.
2724.64,2726.64," So like, my kids awesome."
2726.64,2728.64, So my crusty bunions.
2728.64,2730.64," So, uh,"
2730.64,2733.64," came into the office on Thursday, I guess."
2733.64,2734.64, Yeah.
2734.64,2737.64," And, uh, there was an Amazon packet sitting on my desk."
2737.64,2739.64, And I always know when I've ordered for a masonsex.
2739.64,2742.64, I'm always excited the waiting for it to show up.
2742.64,2744.64, And I knew it wasn't from me.
2744.64,2748.64, So I opened it up and inside the box were three pairs of socks.
2748.64,2749.64, Which is awesome.
2749.64,2752.64, Sent to me by a reader in Utah.
2752.64,2754.64, And I'm so sorry for listening.
2754.64,2757.64, Because I didn't bring down the piece of paper with your name on it.
2757.64,2758.64, But thank you.
2758.64,2762.64," And next time we record, I will give you a shout out on this podcast."
2762.64,2767.64, Not only did you get a LOL for me because I was just very funny of you to do.
2767.64,2770.64," But also, I'm wearing one of your pairs right now."
2770.64,2772.64, Maybe we should have a Jeff sock telephone.
2772.64,2773.64," Yeah, look here."
2773.64,2774.64, Just on off my shoe.
2774.64,2775.64," See, look, no holes."
2775.64,2776.64, That's right.
2776.64,2778.64," You're like, and that nice gold toe stuff at the top."
2778.64,2779.64, I got a gold toe on it.
2779.64,2780.64, Yeah.
2780.64,2781.64, They're even gray.
2781.64,2783.64, Like the other ones were even new a color to get me.
2783.64,2784.64, It was so thoughtful.
2784.64,2786.64, It's so much to be called your wife.
2786.64,2790.64," I said, hey, we're going to say, I'd ask him to marry me if I wasn't already made the power of the internet."
2790.64,2791.64, But he's socks.
2791.64,2792.64, Yeah.
2792.64,2793.64, He likes me.
2793.64,2795.64, He gets me.
2795.64,2796.64, He completes me.
2796.64,2801.64, And the other news.
2801.64,2804.64, Did we want to cover anything else on the list?
2804.64,2806.64, Or we want to just say it for next time because we're in a hurry.
2806.64,2807.64, What my glasses on the look at this?
2807.64,2809.64, I don't know what else is on the...
2809.64,2810.64, Griefing.
2810.64,2811.64, Crap crap.
2811.64,2815.64," Now we're going to wait for Sean to talk about griefing because he's like master, king,"
2815.64,2816.64, griefer.
2816.64,2818.64, Maybe we'll just...
2818.64,2819.64," Oh, that was his top."
2819.64,2820.64, Okay.
2820.64,2823.64, So I'll just go back and finish our magazine.
2823.64,2825.64, Are we all watching the heroes finale tonight?
2825.64,2826.64, Yeah.
2826.64,2827.64, Tomorrow.
2827.64,2829.64, It'll be on...
2829.64,2830.64," No, it'll be on tomorrow."
2830.64,2832.64, Or it'll already happen.
2832.64,2833.64," Oh, that's right."
2833.64,2834.64," Oh, my God."
2834.64,2835.64, You can do it.
2835.64,2837.64, You guys have any predictions so we can...
2837.64,2839.64," Yeah, they're going to save the children."
2839.64,2840.64, We can't really...
2840.64,2841.64," Yeah, they're going to save the world."
2841.64,2842.64," Right, isn't that the tagline?"
2842.64,2844.64, That's a dumb prediction.
2845.64,2846.64," Come on, don't think of it in one direction."
2846.64,2847.64," I don't watch that, shit."
2847.64,2848.64, I can't believe you don't watch it.
2848.64,2849.64, You're a...
2849.64,2850.64, You're a...
2850.64,2853.64, You're like dialed into every geek culture thing.
2853.64,2855.64," You know, actually, you have like a block against."
2855.64,2857.64," Well, he has some kind of weird rule."
2857.64,2858.64," It's like a three-year rule, right?"
2858.64,2859.64, Right.
2859.64,2862.64, Decide I've been burned by too many shows that started off awesome.
2862.64,2863.64, And then started to suck.
2863.64,2865.64, Maybe a year or two years into it.
2865.64,2866.64, So I'm going to wait and see.
2866.64,2868.64, That's why I waited on Battle Star 2.
2868.64,2870.64," And after like two seasons,"
2870.64,2871.64," the third season started people were like,"
2871.64,2872.64, it was really good.
2872.64,2873.64," And I'm like, okay, I'll watch that."
2873.64,2874.64, And we'll have that much time for TV.
2874.64,2875.64, What about Laugh?
2875.64,2876.64, Did you wait on Laugh?
2876.64,2877.64, Nope.
2877.64,2879.64, And I was a little pissed off that I did.
2879.64,2881.64," Oh, so it was Laugh, so raising your drinking."
2881.64,2882.64, Laugh is one of the heroes.
2882.64,2885.64, Although it has picked up in the last four or so it has.
2885.64,2887.64," Yeah, I just think back from the break."
2887.64,2888.64, They kind of rallied.
2888.64,2889.64, They wasted so much time.
2889.64,2890.64," Oh, my God."
2890.64,2892.64, I was... I swear I was one episode away from...
2892.64,2893.64, Yeah.
2893.64,2894.64, From Bag and On Laugh.
2894.64,2895.64, I think with the...
2895.64,2896.64, I came back right in time for me.
2896.64,2898.64," Well, I keep pulling the Rosencrantz and Gillom's turn episode."
2898.64,2899.64," Oh, the..."
2899.64,2900.64," Yeah, what's our name?"
2900.64,2901.64, The two...
2901.64,2902.64, The two no names that were the spider bites and all that.
2902.64,2903.64," Yeah, I came up with that."
2903.64,2906.64," Come on, everyone thought that the same time."
2906.64,2908.64, But the last few have kicked ass.
2908.64,2909.64, Yeah.
2909.64,2910.64, Yeah.
2910.64,2911.64, Finally.
2911.64,2913.64, And I was thinking maybe I would get into the lost and then they announced that
2913.64,2915.64, Origins thing and then that you could tear us to me.
2915.64,2916.64, Yeah.
2916.64,2917.64, Yeah.
2917.64,2918.64, Here's Origins and that you could people.
2918.64,2921.64, People in the world at large get to vote on one of the characters.
2921.64,2922.64, Yeah.
2922.64,2923.64, Yeah.
2923.64,2924.64, That's the season.
2924.64,2925.64, I know that sounds completely stupid.
2925.64,2927.64, But don't let that taint your mind about them.
2927.64,2929.64, I'm waiting for the hero's MMO inevitably.
2929.64,2930.64, You've heard it here first.
2930.64,2931.64, The hot chick will win.
2931.64,2936.64, What a bold predicted.
2936.64,2941.64, It's quite a good show.
2941.64,2942.64, I believe you.
2942.64,2943.64," Well, season one."
2943.64,2944.64, I've already done it.
2944.64,2945.64, I've already done it.
2945.64,2949.16," And if it completes, if the season one like completes its arc and how I could"
2949.16,2950.64," wrap it self up, maybe I will watch it."
2950.64,2952.64," Well, it's kind of supposed to."
2952.64,2954.64, That's actually been one of the great things about the season.
2954.64,2958.64, Is that there's clearly been an arc that's been like resolving over time.
2958.64,2965.64," You know, they didn't just set up like 45 story lines of, you know, three of which they're going to finish,"
2965.64,2967.64, which is like what lost it here.
2967.64,2970.64, Like everything always kind of cleans itself up in heroes.
2970.64,2971.64, It's nice that way.
2971.64,2973.64, It follows a very rigid comic book structure.
2973.64,2976.64," Like there's a definite beginning, definite end to a season."
2976.64,2981.64, It feels like they've actually made a lot of progress since that first episode.
2981.64,2983.64, It's so dorky.
2983.64,2984.64, That's so it is.
2984.64,2985.64, It's just an geeky.
2985.64,2989.64, And that's why I way more geeky than lost.
2989.64,2992.64," I mean, it's just like complete like our nerd gasm."
2992.64,2995.64, It's just like amazing to me that it's so popular.
2995.64,2998.64, I've tried to sit my wife down to watch a show.
2998.64,2999.64," You know, I don't know how many times."
2999.64,3005.64," She's not a geek, but she has sat with me through, you know, six seasons of X files."
3005.64,3006.64, We've watched Lost together.
3006.64,3008.64, We watched Twin Peaks.
3008.64,3011.64," So she'll like, she'll get into that kind of show."
3011.64,3016.64," And heroes, her watching heroes is like her watching me play a computer game."
3016.64,3018.64, It's like five minutes and she's out.
3018.64,3019.64, She's like whatever.
3019.64,3020.64," You know, if it's cool."
3020.64,3021.64, But that guy can turn invisible.
3021.64,3022.64, Okay.
3022.64,3023.64, Yeah.
3023.64,3024.64, It's an important thing to do.
3024.64,3025.64, It's actually.
3025.64,3027.64, But it's cool.
3027.64,3028.64," You know, but it's cool."
3028.64,3029.64," You know, if it's awesome, it's awesome."
3029.64,3031.64, But it's cool.
3031.64,3033.64," You know, if it's awesome, it's awesome."
3033.64,3034.64, It's awesome.
3034.64,3035.64, It's awesome.
3035.64,3036.64, It's awesome.
3036.64,3037.64, It's awesome.
3037.64,3038.64, It's awesome.
3038.64,3039.64, It's awesome.
3040.64,3044.64," Actually, the, I think the exact opposite problem, like Amy, my wife,"
3044.64,3047.64," she, she never really gets into like most things that, you know,"
3047.64,3048.64," most nerdy things that I like,"
3048.64,3049.64," Biddle, start galactic and all that."
3049.64,3050.64, Yeah.
3050.64,3053.64," But she's, she's actually as excited about heroes as I am."
3053.64,3054.64, Huh.
3054.64,3056.64," And I actually like, there are times during the show as I'm watching."
3056.64,3059.64," And I pause it and I'm like, okay, now this is why this is exactly like a comic book."
3059.64,3062.64," And I'm like, I actually, and I'm, I wouldn't say I'm converting her,"
3062.64,3066.64," but I'm, she's definitely like a, I hope she's appreciating in some way, like,"
3066.64,3068.64," why I'm, why I'm stochomic, dark as well."
3068.64,3069.64, Mm-hmm.
3069.64,3070.64, I don't know.
3070.64,3071.64," If Sean, I late, was here."
3071.64,3073.64," He would discount, we're saying, we're going to stop 10 minutes ago."
3073.64,3074.64, Yeah.
3074.64,3075.64, All right.
3075.64,3076.64, Because he's making fun of us now.
3076.64,3078.64, Right. Because he reads more comic books than I do at this point.
3078.64,3080.64," So, no, just because like it's such a divergent."
3080.64,3084.64," We've been, we've been really good about not diverting into talking about lost."
3084.64,3088.64," Otherwise, well, this is the bonus content of the podcast."
3088.64,3091.64," This is the, basically we were going to sign off like five minutes."
3091.64,3092.64, Okay.
3092.64,3093.64, So this is the extra footage.
3093.64,3094.64, This was the extra footage during the credits.
3094.64,3095.64, Right.
3095.64,3097.64, The crew figures the credits are rolling.
3097.64,3100.64," People are probably tuning out there moving under their next podcast,"
3100.64,3103.64, but we're still here talking about this shit because that's what we do in.
3103.64,3104.64, Yeah.
3104.64,3105.64, That's right.
3105.64,3107.64," Because we're trying to think of, every possibly to avoid working on the issue."
3107.64,3108.64, Right.
3108.64,3110.64, And can I bring up one more thing while I'm procrastinating?
3110.64,3111.64, Please sign off.
3111.64,3114.64, Because I'm just sort of going through this like existential crisis.
3114.64,3117.64," And I actually want to mind if anybody had any feedback from me out there, too."
3117.64,3120.64, If you want to close some of the boards or my blog.
3120.64,3123.64," I decided in the, in the name of cleaning house,"
3123.64,3127.64, I was so much crap in my room that I was going to sell my comic books.
3127.64,3131.64," I've got like five long boxes full of comics and some great ones going back to,"
3131.64,3133.64, to the 80s.
3133.64,3134.64," So I decided, you know what?"
3134.64,3135.64, Screw it.
3135.64,3136.64," I'm, I'm selling them all."
3136.64,3140.64, And I just put it in head up on Craigslist like I got five long boxes.
3140.64,3141.64, I'm not even a collector.
3141.64,3142.64," I don't, you know, whatever."
3142.64,3144.64, So some guy offered me.
3144.64,3147.64," So I go, okay, I'll take them all off your hands for 40 bucks."
3147.64,3148.64," And I was like, okay."
3148.64,3150.64," I said I wanted to get rid of them,"
3150.64,3152.64, but I'm not a fucking moron.
3152.64,3154.64, You're not getting them for 40 dollars.
3154.64,3158.64," I mean, this was like, you know, hundreds of, hundreds of dollars for the stuff."
3158.64,3161.64," So then when I started pricing them,"
3161.64,3162.64, does anybody give a shit about this?
3162.64,3163.64," No, it gives a shit."
3163.64,3165.64," Well, no, actually, I, but he might have been going."
3165.64,3166.64," I know, you're looking at me."
3166.64,3168.64," I'm kind of wondering where this is, okay."
3168.64,3172.64," Well, the thing is, I, I, I, I got a couple offers."
3172.64,3177.64," And then when I, I, of guys who want to specific series that I listed."
3177.64,3179.64," And then when I went back and actually did a price thing on him,"
3179.64,3185.64," I realized they were worth like, not a fortune, but like 30 bucks a PC."
3185.64,3188.64," Whereas I was going to maybe solve the entire thing,"
3188.64,3190.64, the entire run for 30 bucks.
3190.64,3193.64," So I realized, okay, I could actually make a lot of money here."
3193.64,3196.64," So I decided, okay, I'm not going to solve them now."
3196.64,3198.64," Now, you see the thing is, they say they say like,"
3198.64,3200.64," like, comics worth 30 bucks."
3200.64,3201.64, But you're just wearing the hoodie.
3201.64,3202.64, You're going to find that person a buy.
3202.64,3206.64, If you have to individually photograph it and get it like authenticated.
3207.64,3209.64, And then you got to put it up on eBay.
3209.64,3210.64, I don't have time for that.
3210.64,3211.64, Exactly.
3211.64,3212.64, But see now here's the reason I brought it up.
3212.64,3216.64," Now after like, blocking because I realized I was probably going to screw"
3216.64,3217.64, myself on the money.
3217.64,3219.64, Now I think I don't want to do it.
3219.64,3220.64, I think I want to keep them.
3220.64,3222.64," Well, you're going to get this cluttered."
3222.64,3225.64," If you're only going to get 40 bucks for him, and there's like this potential of making a"
3225.64,3228.64," bazillion dollars, you really want the 40 bucks knows that worth it."
3228.64,3230.64," Well, it wasn't even the money."
3230.64,3231.64, It was like the clock.
3231.64,3233.64, But it's probably another crapping gift.
3233.64,3235.64, I think the trick is finding the ones that are actually worth something.
3235.64,3238.64, Weeding them out of the box and then dumping them off for 40 bucks or whatever.
3238.64,3241.64, Do you guys all have tons of comic books sitting wearing a hat?
3241.64,3244.64," I've been I've been I've been shook it amount for a while, but I do keep the ones that are valuable."
3244.64,3249.64," The best example I could think of is that when I was a kid, I bought teenage mutinator"
3249.64,3252.64, turtles number one first printing first edition.
3252.64,3255.64, And I sold it for a thousand bucks.
3255.64,3256.64, What?
3256.64,3257.64, Seriously?
3257.64,3258.64, Yeah.
3258.64,3259.64, Wow.
3259.64,3260.64, First training.
3260.64,3261.64, My god.
3261.64,3262.64, Hang on to that Jeff.
3262.64,3263.64, Is that like the old black and white one?
3263.64,3264.64, Yeah.
3264.64,3265.64, I'm a friend.
3265.64,3266.64, Like a red cover.
3266.64,3267.64, I think it was anyway.
3267.64,3269.64," But at the point was, I sold it."
3269.64,3272.64, I found it's like retarded collector who desperately wanted it.
3272.64,3273.64, Yours.
3273.64,3274.64, All yours.
3274.64,3276.64, It's not really the money even though really.
3276.64,3277.64, It isn't.
3277.64,3280.64, It's just it was like even as I was going through them just to like see what I had to price them.
3280.64,3282.64," I was like, oh, I remember buying that one."
3282.64,3283.64," And my quote, you had this."
3283.64,3285.64, It's worth money.
3285.64,3290.64," Well, the weird ones to me were like the original."
3290.64,3292.64, They're not even that old.
3292.64,3296.64, It's the recent new ultimate spider-man's.
3296.64,3298.64, But I have a starting with number one for some reason.
3298.64,3299.64, Those were all my favorite.
3299.64,3301.64, I'm an excellent spider-man.
3301.64,3302.64, And the ultimate ex-man's.
3302.64,3303.64, I have all those too.
3303.64,3304.64, Yeah.
3304.64,3305.64, Right.
3305.64,3306.64," And that's just, that's not that old."
3306.64,3307.64, Yeah.
3307.64,3308.64, That's a few years ago.
3308.64,3309.64, Yeah.
3309.64,3310.64, I'm okay.
3310.64,3311.64, I'm going to go check out.
3311.64,3313.64, Maybe the print runs were short back then or small.
3313.64,3316.64, Then I have a lot of ex-man's from way way back.
3316.64,3318.64, So those are actually worth a bunch.
3318.64,3319.64, In the 70's.
3319.64,3320.64, All right.
3320.64,3321.64, This could go on.
3321.64,3322.64, Yeah.
3322.64,3323.64, And that's all.
3323.64,3325.64, And that we're veering into the app.
3325.64,3326.64, I forgot to tell him.
3326.64,3327.64, I want something.
3327.64,3329.64, And also.
3329.64,3331.64, So email jump underscore green.
3331.64,3332.64, If you want to buy.
3332.64,3334.64, I'm not taking that much space.
3334.64,3335.64, Or are they?
3335.64,3336.64, That's what I'm thinking.
3336.64,3340.64," I'm thinking as soon as they like were driven away and in some guys van, I'd be going,"
3340.64,3341.64, No.
3341.64,3342.64, I'll be chasing after the van.
3342.64,3343.64, You know.
3343.64,3345.64, Bring my comics five long boxes.
3345.64,3346.64, Not that.
3346.64,3350.64," Like I said, just we don't, I say, we don't the ones that are actually worth something"
3350.64,3351.64, and get rid of the junk.
3351.64,3352.64, Yeah.
3352.64,3355.64, You don't need five long boxes worth just maybe one.
3355.64,3357.64, I'll give you 50 bucks.
3357.64,3358.64, Okay.
3358.64,3359.64, Sold.
3359.64,3361.64, All right.
3361.64,3363.64, We're going to be back next week.
3363.64,3365.64, We probably have a Chaneli-A-Bak.
3365.64,3367.64, We may have James Malky with us.
3367.64,3369.64, Maybe not.
3369.64,3371.64, Maybe we'll talk about cool stuff.
3371.64,3372.64, Maybe we won't.
3372.64,3374.64, Probably talk about lost again.
3374.64,3375.64, Or maybe not.
3375.64,3377.64," Yeah, we're never known with us."
3377.64,3378.64, We're crazy.
3379.64,3381.64, We're the wacky podcast.
