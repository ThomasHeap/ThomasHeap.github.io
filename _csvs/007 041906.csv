0.0,13.0, Hello and welcome once again to the C.D.W podcast with me are the regular cast from the C.D.W editorial team who will now introduce themselves.
13.0,14.0, Ryan Scott?
14.0,16.0, Sean Elliott.
16.0,17.0, Darren Gladstone.
17.0,20.0," And by the way guys, I think that we the only thing Ryan says today."
20.0,21.0, That's it.
21.0,22.0, That's it.
22.0,23.0, We're done.
23.0,24.0, His name.
24.0,26.0, And we have a special guest engineer today Andrew Fister.
26.0,27.0, And I'm up to very young.
27.0,34.0," Also, before we start apparently on this staff somewhere, one of us is a mouth breather because"
34.0,38.0, for the last two episodes somebody's been breathing heavily into the mic the entire time.
38.0,41.0, I have a horrible feeling that might be me.
41.0,42.0, Okay.
42.0,44.0, I'm so scared.
44.0,50.0, So that we're all going to try to not breathe into the mics and if we do we we're sorry.
50.0,53.0, Our mother's racist poorly.
53.0,59.0, We're going to dive right into it with the Star Force watch which we started last week and maybe
59.0,60.0, we're ending this week.
60.0,65.7," Well, probably not but there was big news in the Star Force world this week and Darren, you"
65.7,68.0, want to explain what happened.
68.0,73.0," Well, I guess the lesson learned is whatever you see a company they might actually listen"
73.0,74.0, every once in a while.
74.0,78.0, So you'd be soft backs off and says you were no longer using Star Force.
78.0,81.0," Yeah, so congratulations you be soft."
81.0,83.0, We're actually going to start playing CSI now.
83.0,84.0, Yeah.
84.0,86.0, That was three dimensions.
86.0,87.0, Three dimensions of murder.
87.0,88.0, Right.
88.0,89.0, Right.
89.0,95.0," You know that when we put a Ubisoft demo on our one of our last ever CDs, what do we have on there?"
95.0,96.0, I think it was a split itself.
96.0,103.0, It actually installed Star Force onto our readers computers because it was a Ubisoft
103.0,109.0," game that used Star Force for protection, but then that protection also applied to the demo."
109.0,111.0, So this is very thing we were racking on.
111.0,112.0, We also included.
112.0,114.0," So basically do as we say, but not as we do."
114.0,115.0," Well, we didn't."
115.0,116.0, We actually didn't know at the time.
116.0,119.0," Now that I know, I'm twice as mad about Star Force."
119.0,122.0," So, but there was a mighty magic now."
122.0,123.0, Five.
123.0,124.0, I can safely play.
124.0,126.0," Darkness, I be on that."
126.0,128.0," Dark, my side stuff splinter itself."
128.0,129.0, Yeah.
129.0,130.0, It was big news.
130.0,132.0, It was good to see them listen to the peep.
133.0,136.0, Yeah. Now I just to wait for Ubisoft or to remove Star Force.
136.0,137.0, Who made that came?
137.0,138.0, CDV.
138.0,139.0, My best friends.
139.0,140.0, I'm listening.
140.0,141.0, See the beginning.
141.0,142.0, What?
142.0,143.0, Star Force.
143.0,144.0, Here next.
144.0,145.0, You are next.
145.0,148.0, So that's I think that's all on our.
148.0,149.0, Our.
149.0,152.0," Sean, Sean's making slapping motions."
152.0,155.0, I don't know what he's slapping.
155.0,158.0, So that's it for Star Force.
158.0,159.0," I think for this week, right?"
159.0,160.0, That's it for now.
162.0,163.0, Okay.
163.0,164.0, And we'll see you next week.
164.0,166.0, And we've got a stop killing motion was.
166.0,169.0, That was that moving on to moving on to the next thing.
169.0,170.0, Right.
170.0,172.0," Okay. I thought you were just like randomly, you know."
172.0,174.0, That's slapping your slaps.
174.0,176.0, B and D dungeon or something for a moment.
176.0,177.0, Agrewing.
177.0,179.0, Okay.
179.0,181.0," Well, we have a list of topics here."
181.0,186.0," And one of these is is majorly gaming, which I don't really know anything about Sean Elliott."
186.0,189.0, So why don't you tell us what that is you want to talk about there.
190.0,192.0, You put it on the list.
192.0,193.0, I didn't put it on the list.
193.0,194.0, I like it.
194.0,195.0, I love Darren.
195.0,196.0, I'm the blame.
196.0,199.0," So if from what I'm reading here, it looks like."
199.0,204.0, I'm answering a USA network and there was no.
204.0,207.0, I actually watch and I think I will depending on the content they put on there.
207.0,208.0," Now, what is it?"
208.0,210.0, It's video of guys playing games.
210.0,211.0, That's the thing.
211.0,214.0," I mean, I guess the channel like, you know, play up the whole obviously playing up."
214.0,216.0, It's a sport offering a big money prizes.
216.0,218.0, I guess the question I always have with these things is like.
218.0,223.0," I've had problems watching people play games in the past, but when I do it, go to like, you know, a quake counter something."
223.0,227.0," You get kind of the vibe, you know, the fans, you're hanging out with it."
227.0,228.0, It's more of a party environment.
228.0,230.0, I don't know if it's held to prepare at home.
230.0,231.0, Exactly.
231.0,232.0, Okay.
232.0,233.0, So here's the thing I'm thinking about.
233.0,238.0," I don't know if I'll watch it every night, but I mean, now days we see poker on the position."
238.0,239.0, Yeah.
239.0,240.0, That's a spectator sport.
240.0,242.0, We see paintball more and more.
242.0,243.0, Right.
243.0,244.0, As a spectator sport.
244.0,247.0," So it's kind of like every time we say no one's going to watch it, people's prizes."
247.0,248.0, And up watching it.
248.0,250.0," And this case, here's what I like about it."
250.0,255.0," So for one, when it's really high level play, especially in a shooter or something, and this goes for everything."
255.0,260.0," A star craft, you know, it's mesmerizing in that you just aren't, you just weren't aware that these things were possible."
260.0,261.0, And you're looking at it.
261.0,263.0, And they're sort of that magic aspect to it.
263.0,265.0," We're like, are these people cheating?"
265.0,266.0," And you know, they're not cheating."
266.0,267.0, They're just this good.
267.0,272.0," So if someone who, if you play casually, it's interesting to see that level of play."
272.0,275.0," And especially if you're used to these guys who open your button servers, right?"
275.0,277.0, Now you're seeing kind of what's going on there.
277.0,286.0," On the other hand, I think it would be fun too, if even if they have wild guilds going, imagine the crazy finish not job known as dives from the white him and these."
286.0,288.0, Screaming and raging at his kill.
288.0,291.0," Now imagine if you could watch, I mean, there would be a lot of bleeps going on."
291.0,296.0," But if you could watch, yeah, kills go through a raid on O'Nixia or whatever."
296.0,297.0," And you know, wipe on that."
297.0,299.0, That would be pretty entertaining.
299.0,300.0, Maybe once though.
300.0,303.0, That's what I were in the Ever gets old.
303.0,307.0, You think that stuff has been going on in the office for a month now.
307.0,310.0," It's like, yeah, that's the moment you hear playing on someone's computers."
310.0,312.0," Yeah, that's definitely more than once."
312.0,314.0, And the sound boards are awesome.
314.0,320.0," Yeah, you know, the poker analogy is a good one, but I also wonder though, because like watching poker on TV, there's two things for one."
320.0,322.0, It's like super slow.
322.0,329.0," I mean, in other words, the game is progressing so slowly that you can, as opposed to a death mat say or a real time strategy game,"
329.0,335.0," where you can actually like kind of have a poker channel on to be doing other things and then checking in on the game, right?"
335.0,336.0, Right.
336.0,341.0," Like actually trying to watch an RTS match, almost seems like kind of exhausting for a lot."
341.0,344.0, And then also just like to be able to even understand what's going on.
344.0,347.0, Think about a high scoring game like basketball though.
347.0,349.0," I mean, you could be turned away from that."
349.0,351.0," Go grab a beer and come back in, you know, the, right?"
351.0,353.0, The scoreboard's going to change a bit.
353.0,355.0, But you're not going to be that far out of it.
355.0,358.0," Okay, but the other thing about poker too is like to me what makes poker on TV,"
358.0,363.0," cool, is the way they figured out for you to be able to see the people's hands, the down cards, right?"
363.0,366.0, So then you actually get to like watch their strategy.
366.0,368.0, Like you know something the other players don't know.
368.0,372.0," So they're sort of an element of suspense there as well as an element of,"
372.0,374.0," well, what would I do if I was that guy?"
374.0,376.0, But I don't know how that would translate into.
376.0,378.0," That's, I think it's a good point."
378.0,383.0," You could play that up with multiple, with paneling and tiling screens where you can pair, you know, you can just suppose two different viewpoints."
383.0,385.0," So the stalker and then the prey, you know,"
386.0,392.0, you can actually see that sort of thing working or you can show a whole squad to view point at once.
392.0,396.0, Maybe you can handle it in a four and you see how they're actually working together.
396.0,398.0, And it would reveal that stuff.
398.0,404.0, And then one other thing I think that would make it interesting is I assume they would do something like this with the TV poker went on.
404.0,406.0, It's like make the people an issue too.
406.0,412.0," So you're not just showing this, but make it so you care the way you do with any athlete, you know, you don't care about the athletes."
412.0,419.0," You're not going to care so much about the game, but if they can, you know, if they follow these people and track them in their season and see what's on it's stake for them."
419.0,422.0," I mean, just train like look at us spellbound or something."
422.0,428.0," You know, who wants to watch kids study for a spelling bee, but when you actually do it, it's really interesting is the stakes are so high."
428.0,431.0," Irrespective of what they're actually doing, you know, right."
431.0,433.0, So here I assume there's all that drama there as well.
433.0,434.0, And it'd be interesting.
434.0,436.0, And I opening for people to see that.
436.0,437.0, Right.
437.0,448.0," I'll play it up and just going back to one thing you're talking about like, you know, paneling and having all this stuff like one thing I was thinking is they're going to need to dedicate a good dedicated camera man in game as an inspector mode just kind of following the action from a more of a bird's eye view."
448.0,452.0," Yeah, they'd have to be a pretty savvy director there who really understood the game."
452.0,453.0, Right.
453.0,456.0," Understood, you know, where to be who to be following."
456.0,457.0, Definitely.
457.0,462.0," Yeah, because I try watching some people play games, you know, in someone's first person view and I get a little nauseous sometimes."
462.0,466.0," I want to, I feel like I'm playing and I want to turn right and they're turning left or something."
466.0,474.0," And the director too, it also have to know, you know, or whoever's editing it later, you know, which person to to key in on it any particular moment."
474.0,478.0," You know, if some guys just wandering around in circles, you don't want, you know, want to be watching that."
478.0,487.0," And it has to be time delayed and edited because if it's in real time, you can have someone on a team speak channel, someone who's actually in the tournament playing and say, hey, they're showing up."
487.0,493.0," But just to get I come up behind you with quad damage, you know, you might want to turn around and do this or that."
493.0,499.0, And the same note on this thing outside of cable that worked television sources doing something similar called source TV.
499.0,512.0," And it's in testing mode now and it's basically you go on to this channel and you're seeing a game as it's playing with like a seven to, you know, 15 second delay and more or less watching the same thing happened, but at your computer."
512.0,513.0," So, you're the better."
513.0,514.0, You're the better field.
514.0,517.0," Isn't there like something like battlefield, TV would that's different?"
517.0,522.0," And that's basically recording your matches for play for playback later when they're done, where source TV is more of a kind of a game."
522.0,529.0, There's source TV is more of like playing up the spectator sport aspect of it where you're watching it with just a few seconds delay and seeing a game in motion.
529.0,533.0," And so, you know, when they wrap it up, you can celebrate or."
533.0,541.0, I still just have a hard time getting behind the gaming on TV thing with all due respect to the gaming TV channels out there.
541.0,550.0," You know, I still feel like if it's the time in the evening where I'm thinking about gaming, I want to play a game and not watch TV about a game."
550.0,554.0," You know, I suppose you could say that about this or reading a magazine, I suppose."
554.0,555.0, I think about this.
555.0,556.0, Yeah.
556.0,558.0, Where does that put this?
558.0,561.0, Why are other people playing a game to do this?
561.0,564.0," Then you have a, there's the Korean model too."
564.0,568.0," South Korea where not just one network, but multiple dozen of the networks."
568.0,572.0," And the guys come in with like wrestling, entrance team, music and fanfare and."
572.0,574.0, Take the stations and just got.
574.0,575.0, That's what we need.
575.0,576.0, That's what we need.
576.0,577.0, That's what we need.
577.0,584.0," Yeah, well, when I was at BlizzCon, I was watching the, you know, the ace players playing Starcraft and that was really fun to me."
584.0,590.0," So I don't know, I guess if you know the game and the players are really good, maybe maybe you're right."
590.0,591.0, I don't know.
591.0,597.0," It'd be funny though, like the, the signal people doing signature moves and stuff, spray tags and this and that, but."
597.0,600.0," Maybe the key would be like a great announcer too, you know."
600.0,602.0," Did fight tell, sir, to guy."
602.0,603.0, You gotta just go in.
603.0,606.0, Frrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
606.0,607.0," All right, I take it back."
607.0,610.0, I don't want to watch that.
610.0,612.0," We, we need the stuff starting."
612.0,613.0," Uh, don't know."
613.0,615.0, Maybe the fall.
615.0,616.0, Hmm.
616.0,617.0, We don't know.
617.0,621.0, We just talk about what the last day we just saw on the internet somewhere.
621.0,623.0, It was a rumor.
623.0,625.0, Where you're gaming experts.
625.0,626.0, Allegedly.
626.0,627.0, Allegedly.
627.0,631.0," Uh, next on the agenda is we're going to talk about."
631.0,641.0," Uh, preloading of upcoming games, which include such topics or such games as sin and aftermath."
641.0,642.0, Are we excited about this?
642.0,643.0, Is anyone going to do it?
643.0,644.0, I've been Sean.
644.0,645.0, Yeah.
645.0,648.0," I already have, I already have a sin preloaded and a weight none after math."
648.0,650.0, After math is now episode two.
650.0,651.0, It's got to add.
651.0,653.0, Just for just for the people of.
653.0,655.0," Oh, they want to."
655.0,656.0, We changed the name.
656.0,657.0, Yeah.
657.0,658.0, Okay.
658.0,659.0," So, you know, I think it's a very important thing."
659.0,660.0," Also, I mean, prepaid."
660.0,664.0," Uh, you don't need to pre-paid a preload."
664.0,665.0, You don't.
665.0,668.0, And I think it works in their favor that way because then you can just unimpulse.
668.0,670.0, You don't have to really worry about it in preload just in case.
670.0,672.0," And then you feel like, hey, man, let's go click the pay button now."
672.0,673.0, Since I've already got it.
673.0,674.0, Am I.
674.0,675.0, But what does it get you to preload?
675.0,677.0," I mean, what does that mean?"
677.0,678.0, Is it like already on your mission?
678.0,679.0, It's not to be afraid to line.
679.0,683.0," So, uh, when the official download does become available rather than"
683.0,686.0," killing up with all these people for all this, you know, fighting for the same bandwidth,"
686.0,690.0, you basically are just pressing an activation button in your playing right then and there.
690.0,692.0," So, you actually have it on your machine right now."
692.0,694.0, Just say the environment waiting for the activation code.
694.0,695.0," So, why not they just activate it right now?"
695.0,698.0, I think it's part of a deal because they might be timing it.
698.0,699.0, This is all speculating.
699.0,700.0, Yeah.
700.0,704.0, But I know that there's a talk of like working to have a retail release as well.
704.0,705.0, So maybe they try to time it out.
705.0,708.0, So it's a release digitally and with retail.
708.0,710.0," I guess as thinking that couldn't they just like charred to you,"
710.0,714.0," actually to activate it now, but then of course you could spread it on the internet."
714.0,715.0, Couldn't you?
715.0,716.0," Well, it activates over steam."
716.0,717.0, So I don't know how.
717.0,718.0," Oh, think of that."
718.0,723.0," You don't want to charge people extra for, you want to give people the the discount for being the first in the door."
723.0,729.0," Well, tell you, you know, I preordered the new flaming lips CD on iTunes."
729.0,736.0," And for that, I paid an extra dollar, I think, and I got like a special pre order song."
736.0,738.0," But to me, that was worth it."
738.0,741.0, I was really pissed because I actually paid for the disc.
741.0,742.0, Yeah.
742.0,743.0, No extra song for me.
743.0,744.0, Yeah.
744.0,748.0," But I mean, so what I'm saying is that maybe gamers would do that too."
748.0,755.0, Like I'll pay extra than what the regular streaming download would be if you give me this or that.
755.0,757.0, Give me that horse armor.
757.0,761.0," The fun thing about it is that instead of, you know,"
761.0,767.0," people going to stores various parts of the day and different, you know, different time zones and stuff and coming back to message boards and reporting."
767.0,776.0," On, you know, their experience with the game, you got those situations where friends can just basically pop into team speak count down together and then start playing and talking about it at the same time."
776.0,780.0, I mentioned that in the preview for synepisodes and
780.0,787.0," President of ritual over there, Thomas Stain was, you know, talking about how he hopes for the same thing where you've got."
787.0,794.0," You basically people, you know, lined up and actually talking to one another as they're playing and hey, I just went over here and did this, you know, and comparing it,"
794.0,799.0," comparing it, contrasting experiences and stuff. And I think that part of it can be pretty fun."
799.0,806.0," Yeah, oh, and before I forget, I just want to say, if you get a chance now, you can actually also download the original syngame."
806.0,811.0," So that's that's for free. So you could just check that out and you'll, we live the past a little."
811.0,813.0," What, uh, Anton was that again?"
813.0,816.0," Oh, I am totally drawing a blank right now."
816.0,818.0, And the half life engine.
819.0,825.0," No, because I thought that was concurrent with how it actually came out like the same week is or it came out within a week or two, eight half life one."
825.0,827.0, Quick to maybe I think it's quick to engine.
827.0,833.0," All right. Well, somebody sent us an email or post on our message board and tells what engine,"
833.0,836.0, sin was in and we're sorry for not knowing anything again.
836.0,839.0, You're gaming experts.
839.0,840.0, Again.
840.0,842.0, That's a theme of this week's show.
842.0,844.0, We know nothing.
845.0,847.0, And speaking of knowing nothing.
847.0,851.0, Topic number four is actually a big one for us.
851.0,853.0," Actually, it's not that we know nothing."
853.0,854.0, We know a lot about this one.
854.0,857.0, Because this is all we're thinking about these days.
857.0,860.0," Uh, we're going to get to our, uh, our, uh,"
860.0,862.0, reader questions.
862.0,863.0, Here.
863.0,867.0," And the one question that we're, we're drawing a,"
867.0,871.0," the most has to do with our new issue that that you guys have,"
871.0,872.0, the May issue.
873.0,875.0," We actually just finished June, but you have May."
875.0,880.0," And that was the debut of our new format, which is has a lot of changes,"
880.0,883.0, but the biggest one has to do with the review section.
883.0,886.0," And this question from, uh,"
886.0,889.0," Philip Davis actually is a very general,"
889.0,892.0, but it's one that that represents a lot of you.
892.0,893.0," And he asks,"
893.0,897.0, what prompted you to make the big reviews section change.
897.0,899.0, Now called viewpoint.
899.0,904.0, We don't really have to spend any more detail on what the changes are because I think you all know them.
904.0,906.0, We cut up the scores.
906.0,912.0, We have bonded with one up in presenting multiple viewpoints on each review.
912.0,914.0," Um,"
914.0,917.0," well, actually one and I let you feel this Ryan."
917.0,920.0, This means you're going to have to talk since you're the reviews editor.
920.0,922.0, I have to talk.
922.0,924.0, All right.
924.0,926.0," In a louder voice than what the,"
927.0,928.0, Wow.
928.0,932.0, What prompted us to make the big review section change?
932.0,934.0, That is the question.
934.0,936.0," And your answer is, um,"
936.0,940.0, I think it's sort of sort of like a question of relevance.
940.0,941.0," You know, we,"
941.0,946.0," we are reviews as, as they were sort of,"
946.0,953.0, we were sort of given people the same thing that all the websites sort of had six to eight weeks later.
954.0,957.0, And we were tired of doing that.
957.0,958.0," Um, you know,"
958.0,962.0," that is the basic reason and a lot of the response we've gotten in the letters,"
962.0,963.0," uh,"
963.0,965.0, mailbox has been well.
965.0,966.0, I only read CGW.
966.0,967.0, Right.
967.0,968.0," So what do we,"
968.0,971.0," what do we say to these people who who didn't,"
971.0,973.0," who don't do what our assumption was,"
973.0,976.0, which is that they are getting gaming news online all the time.
976.0,979.0, That maybe they did just read this print magazine.
979.0,982.0," And that a six to eight week review, uh,"
982.0,984.0," late review is actually,"
984.0,985.0," you know,"
985.0,987.0, not a big deal to them.
987.0,988.0," Well, I think,"
988.0,989.0, I don't know.
989.0,992.0," I might be looking at this different than a reader would,"
992.0,995.0," but if I were to just look at our reviews without reading,"
995.0,997.0," say like the one up review or something,"
997.0,999.0, I would still be getting something out of them.
999.0,1000.0," I don't think,"
1000.0,1001.0," you know,"
1001.0,1005.0, you're required to have read all about a game before you see it in CGW.
1005.0,1006.0," Like you might,"
1007.0,1009.0," you might be able to take up on a couple more things,"
1009.0,1012.0," if you've seen an online review,"
1012.0,1013.0," or you see it in the mag,"
1013.0,1015.0, but I don't think that's like a hindrance.
1015.0,1021.0," In fact, our intention is really to kind of be more like a last word on a game."
1021.0,1022.0, Right.
1022.0,1023.0," But if we're doing our job right,"
1023.0,1025.0, I think what you said is correct.
1025.0,1026.0," Um,"
1026.0,1028.0, we're trying to just present a broader picture.
1028.0,1029.0," We're not,"
1029.0,1030.0," you know,"
1030.0,1032.0," we're not trying to abdicate,"
1032.0,1033.0," uh,"
1033.0,1034.0, our responsibility.
1034.0,1035.0," And of course,"
1035.0,1037.0," we have opinions on these games,"
1037.0,1039.0," and we want to share those opinions,"
1039.0,1043.0," but we're trying to put it in the bigger context of that,"
1043.0,1047.0, that our opinions are coming weeks and weeks after the game's shipped.
1047.0,1050.0, They're not coming the day that they shut up and stores.
1050.0,1053.0," And so we're trying to use that to our advantage,"
1053.0,1055.0," where in the past it sort of been hindrance to us,"
1055.0,1056.0," like for example,"
1056.0,1059.0," the issue we're just now starting is the,"
1059.0,1060.0," uh,"
1060.0,1061.0, to lie issue.
1061.0,1062.0," And we're,"
1062.0,1063.0," and in that issue,"
1063.0,1064.0, we're trying to be able to do that.
1064.0,1065.0," Yeah, no, it's the June issue."
1065.0,1066.0," The one we just finished,"
1066.0,1068.0, which is going to ship in on May 20th.
1068.0,1071.0, That's when our oblivion review is going to appear.
1071.0,1072.0," Even in the old format,"
1072.0,1074.0, we could have done it no sooner than that.
1074.0,1077.0," So the first time CDW is going to reveal oblivion,"
1077.0,1080.0, was going to be for people picking it up in mid May.
1080.0,1081.0," Well,"
1081.0,1085.0," who really needs that kind of review,"
1085.0,1086.0," uh,"
1086.0,1087.0," as if the way we,"
1087.0,1089.0," the way we'd written them in the past,"
1089.0,1090.0," where we're,"
1090.0,1091.0," we're writing as if this is,"
1091.0,1092.0," we know this at the first time they're going to be seeing it,"
1092.0,1093.0, or we're assuming this is the first time
1093.0,1094.0, that I'm going to be seeing an opinion.
1094.0,1095.0, Who really needs that in May?
1095.0,1097.0," Because in May,"
1097.0,1098.0," most people have played it,"
1098.0,1100.0," form their own opinion,"
1100.0,1101.0," read other reviews,"
1101.0,1102.0, and sold the game back.
1102.0,1103.0, Right.
1103.0,1105.0, So where were they going to sell that game back?
1105.0,1108.0, You can't sell PC games on eBay.
1108.0,1109.0, All right.
1109.0,1110.0, Or Craigslist.
1110.0,1111.0, Half.com.
1111.0,1112.0," And so, so the idea you're,"
1112.0,1113.0, you're already planning that out.
1113.0,1115.0," The idea instead is to say,"
1115.0,1117.0," um,"
1117.0,1119.0," that,"
1119.0,1121.0," to still tell you what we think,"
1121.0,1122.0," whether it's an editor's choice,"
1122.0,1124.0," whether we think this was,"
1124.0,1125.0," you know,"
1125.0,1126.0," an awesome effort or not,"
1126.0,1127.0," whether we think it's,"
1127.0,1128.0," it's worthy of buying,"
1128.0,1131.0," but also to put it in a bigger context of the gaming community,"
1131.0,1133.0," of not what,"
1133.0,1135.0," only what other websites have said,"
1135.0,1137.0," not only what one up.com has said,"
1137.0,1138.0," uh,"
1138.0,1140.0," but also what maybe the developers say,"
1140.0,1141.0," in fact,"
1141.0,1142.0," in the,"
1142.0,1143.0," in the oblivion review,"
1143.0,1146.0," we have one page that is an interview with Todd Howard,"
1146.0,1148.0," the lead designer of oblivion,"
1148.0,1150.0, to get his own take on how he feels the game went.
1151.0,1152.0," I,"
1152.0,1153.0," and in some ways too,"
1153.0,1156.0, there are cases and games where it's definitely not cut and dry.
1156.0,1158.0, They're going to be different camps.
1158.0,1161.0," You're going to have a group that insists that something works perfectly,"
1161.0,1162.0," you know,"
1162.0,1163.0," that they love the way it works,"
1163.0,1166.0, and then there's going to be another that disagrees all the way.
1166.0,1167.0," And the way we're doing it now,"
1167.0,1170.0, we can actually acknowledge both of those perspectives.
1170.0,1172.0, It doesn't mean we're seeding to one or the other.
1172.0,1173.0," We'll,"
1173.0,1174.0," we'll come in and like say,"
1174.0,1175.0," for example,"
1175.0,1176.0," my year of force,"
1176.0,1177.0," and,"
1177.0,1178.0," you know,"
1178.0,1179.0," patch,"
1179.0,1181.0," I'm saying what I think,"
1181.0,1183.0," but I'm also saying these other viewpoints exist,"
1183.0,1185.0," and I still think this despite those,"
1185.0,1187.0," but if you're just actually reading,"
1187.0,1188.0," you're saying,"
1188.0,1189.0," the,"
1189.0,1192.0," the opposition he's describing actually describes my general,"
1192.0,1193.0," you know,"
1193.0,1195.0, temperament when it comes to these types of games.
1195.0,1196.0," So maybe I'm not going to agree with the,"
1196.0,1198.0," with the editor in this case,"
1198.0,1199.0," you know,"
1199.0,1200.0, right.
1200.0,1201.0, So it's still there.
1201.0,1202.0," And I think it's like basic,"
1202.0,1203.0," you know,"
1203.0,1206.0," college paper writing,"
1206.0,1207.0," it's like, you know,"
1207.0,1208.0," you,"
1208.0,1209.0," you know,"
1209.0,1210.0," you know,"
1210.0,1211.0," you know,"
1211.0,1212.0," you know,"
1212.0,1213.0," you know,"
1213.0,1214.0," you can also support your argument,"
1214.0,1216.0, in some cases where other people have an agree with you.
1216.0,1217.0," And by drawing,"
1217.0,1218.0," you know,"
1218.0,1219.0," we're still feeling our way,"
1219.0,1220.0," toward how it,"
1220.0,1221.0, how exactly do it.
1221.0,1222.0," We,"
1222.0,1223.0, we are.
1223.0,1224.0," I mean,"
1224.0,1225.0," I think that's one thing we want to tell readers over,"
1225.0,1227.0," over the podcast here today,"
1227.0,1229.0, so we're acknowledging this is a work in progress.
1229.0,1230.0," You know,"
1230.0,1232.0, we're very much forging new ground here.
1232.0,1233.0, We are.
1233.0,1234.0," We're,"
1234.0,1235.0," we're saying that the,"
1235.0,1237.0, the monthly gaming magazine format needs to change.
1237.0,1238.0," And that we're,"
1238.0,1240.0," we want to sort of lead the charge in that,"
1240.0,1241.0," but, you know,"
1241.0,1244.0," we'd be lying if we said we had it all mapped out like evil geniuses,"
1244.0,1246.0, and we know exactly how it's going to work.
1246.0,1247.0," We're,"
1247.0,1248.0," you know,"
1248.0,1251.0, we're going to be fiddling with it over the months to see what works and doesn't.
1251.0,1255.0," And I think I could safely say that the new viewpoint section is like,"
1255.0,1256.0," you know,"
1256.0,1258.0, exponentially better than that first one.
1258.0,1259.0, Don't you think?
1259.0,1262.0," Well, one of the big things that people have been complaining about this issue is just,"
1262.0,1264.0," the line at that self,"
1264.0,1265.0," you know,"
1265.0,1266.0," you know,"
1266.0,1268.0," you're getting rainbow six review,"
1268.0,1271.0, which we kind of already didn't even have to.
1271.0,1274.0, You got three pages on a downloadable word game on
1274.0,1276.0," Bonnie's bookstore,"
1276.0,1279.0," and you've got a big patch review on X3,"
1279.0,1281.0, like that kind of the meat of the review section.
1281.0,1283.0, It was slim picking so some months and we.
1283.0,1284.0," I mean,"
1284.0,1285.0, it was kind of a transition month.
1285.0,1286.0, It was.
1286.0,1287.0," So I mean,"
1287.0,1288.0, next month's going to be better.
1288.0,1291.0," What about how to read the Star Wars Empire War,"
1291.0,1292.0, Tom and Bruce now?
1292.0,1293.0," Are we,"
1293.0,1294.0, are we looking at those as viewpoints?
1294.0,1297.0, We're kind of looking at these as as reviews.
1297.0,1298.0," Yeah,"
1298.0,1304.0, this is we kind of think that Tom versus Bruce is a good way to look at a game in a multiplayer context.
1304.0,1307.0, But we're going to attach like an editor's choice to a game.
1307.0,1308.0," Oh, yeah."
1308.0,1309.0," Oh, yeah."
1309.0,1310.0," Oh, yes."
1310.0,1311.0," Well, we're arguing online here."
1311.0,1312.0," Oh, I'm embarrassing."
1312.0,1314.0," Lord of the Rings Battle from Middle Earth, too,"
1314.0,1315.0, which is the one that they did.
1315.0,1316.0, Yeah.
1316.0,1319.0," The June issue, the next one you guys will be seeing."
1319.0,1321.0, They gave that a choice.
1321.0,1322.0," Oh, boy."
1323.0,1324.0," Oh, boy."
1324.0,1325.0, It's already out the door.
1325.0,1326.0, Did I approve this sort of thing?
1326.0,1328.0, Ryan's going to be in my office after the podcast.
1328.0,1330.0," Ryan Gaming World, sorry, sir."
1330.0,1332.0, Why?
1332.0,1333.0, I guess.
1333.0,1334.0, Yeah.
1334.0,1335.0, Sure.
1335.0,1337.0," But I mean, a game like like."
1337.0,1339.0, I'm not going to who the real shadow masters.
1339.0,1340.0, Exactly.
1340.0,1341.0, The Dick Cheney of.
1341.0,1345.0," I mean, a game like Empire War or a Battle from Middle Earth, too."
1345.0,1349.0," I mean, the multiplayer is kind of what people care the most about with those games."
1349.0,1350.0, Anyway.
1350.0,1351.0, Right.
1351.0,1353.0," You know, the people who are going to keep playing it."
1353.0,1354.0, So I do.
1354.0,1356.0, I understand readers pain.
1356.0,1358.0, I do feel it.
1358.0,1362.0," But I think that we really have to, you know, I believe in what we're doing."
1362.0,1365.0, I think that we have to go forward with this approach.
1365.0,1369.0," But definitely, you know, we've gotten a lot of email about this and a lot of it."
1369.0,1372.0," Is negative and it's a bit, it's a bit hard to take."
1372.0,1374.0, And I wanted to read this and exit of one.
1374.0,1375.0, There's just been all week.
1375.0,1377.0, It's just been annoying me.
1377.0,1379.0, Which is just the.
1380.0,1383.0," The sky. I won't put his name in, but he says, uh,"
1383.0,1384.0, I need reviews.
1384.0,1389.0, The tummy quickly about a game with stars or numbers or letters.
1389.0,1390.0, Anything that writes them.
1390.0,1394.0, I don't have the time at my age to read about video games.
1394.0,1397.0, I just want to know what is good so that I can relax for a few hours.
1397.0,1400.0," And the reason that keeps annoying me is the, uh,"
1400.0,1404.0, I don't have the time at my age to read about video games.
1404.0,1407.0," I mean, he's bought a magazine."
1408.0,1411.0," I'm sorry. And I mean, that personally attacked the sky."
1411.0,1412.0, I'm not saying this name.
1412.0,1415.0," But if you don't have the time to read about video games,"
1415.0,1418.0," why are you, you were looking at a magazine and writing to us."
1418.0,1423.0," You know, I mean, I think that if people really do just want a number for us."
1423.0,1426.0," Well, or just want a number, that that's what game rankings is for."
1426.0,1431.0," And one up. I mean, you go right there and you can access that score immediately."
1431.0,1432.0, Right.
1432.0,1435.0," I mean, we have a page that just has a bunch of one up scores."
1436.0,1438.0," I mean, if you're really exactly if you're just looking for a number score,"
1438.0,1443.0," just go to like whatever like the end page in the, in the view point section where you get covered."
1443.0,1445.0, Right. I just don't feel philosophical.
1445.0,1447.0, That's the point of a magazine.
1447.0,1449.0," No, it's to just get a list of numbers."
1449.0,1454.0, But we do agree about getting more view points in the view point section each month.
1454.0,1458.0, And also making ways to very clear is what our viewpoint is.
1458.0,1461.0," Right. And like, you're not, not every review needs to be three or four pages."
1461.0,1464.0, We're just going to like let the material dictate itself.
1464.0,1470.0, That's right. That not every month is going to be three page reviews of Bonnie's bookstore.
1470.0,1474.0, No offense to Bonnie or her bookstore or her bookstore.
1474.0,1478.0, Especially that cool stuff in the back.
1478.0,1483.0, Okay. Skip is flashing us the we've been talking for 25 minutes.
1483.0,1485.0," Oh, I thought we just got a flashes."
1485.0,1487.0, That's later.
1487.0,1492.0," Do we want to address any other questions, reader questions?"
1492.0,1501.0," Oh, I think we've kind of answered reader Andrew Sullivan writes that, uh, well, he actually asked us how we as a unit participate individually or"
1501.0,1504.0," Okay, I can't read hold on."
1504.0,1510.0," As a unit, or each participant individually view the relationship between the magazine and the one up.com website."
1510.0,1518.0," So I think to answer his question, we're sort of getting it out there in that the website for one can definitely get you"
1518.0,1524.0, the score right away and can get it is the nature of online can get it to you before we can.
1524.0,1525.0, That's right.
1525.0,1532.0," And then we're for all the reasons that we just explained we're coming in after the fact with with all this other and let's re-emphasize, you know,"
1532.0,1537.0, that that one up score counts as the CGW score.
1537.0,1540.0, It counts. We're all one. We're all one happy family here.
1540.0,1543.0, And plus we're sharing the same reviewers and a lot of us that's right.
1543.0,1545.0, That's the CGW staff are going to be reviewing those PC games on one up.
1545.0,1550.0," So yeah, don't make a face. It does count. I mean, that paid more."
1550.0,1554.0," No, that's the truth about what we think of."
1554.0,1558.0, This is plain.
1558.0,1562.0," More from Andrew, solving because he has a long long list of questions."
1562.0,1565.0, And thank you Andrew.
1565.0,1569.0, But we're not going to read any more of it apparently.
1570.0,1576.0," Well, quick thing on the N. Yes, if we use the blogging features on the main site and thank you guys can answer that."
1576.0,1580.0, I know Jeff and Darren and Ryan all blog.
1580.0,1585.0," I like the blogging feature. I wish I had a little more time to do it, but I do like it a lot."
1585.0,1589.0, It's I try to get some things in there that I wouldn't talk about in the magazine.
1589.0,1596.0, Maybe just more personal things about what's going on in the game or in my private life.
1596.0,1606.0," I actually have I have to apologize because one of the things reading except for my mom, but I haven't updated my blog since like December."
1606.0,1608.0, That's mostly because I suck.
1608.0,1611.0," No, we know that. Thank you. Thank you very much."
1611.0,1614.0, I only blog about once a month. I don't use the blog room.
1614.0,1617.0, I'm on the message board every day though. So.
1617.0,1623.0," Yeah, I'm definitely a lurker on the message boards. I don't write all the time, but I definitely read all the all the stuff on the forums."
1623.0,1631.0," So I think all of us are on the message boards. We don't always post a lot, but if you post dear reader, we are definitely there reading them."
1631.0,1635.0, That's the thing. I don't blog because I do all that stuff on the message boards.
1635.0,1639.0, I'd rather just be like wild and woolly and dynamic and go on there.
1639.0,1641.0, But the thing is we could definitely use some more posts on our boards.
1641.0,1648.0," And I'm always there lurking. And so in the meantime, I'm on the EGM board to wait for you guys to come and put your activity on the CGW boards."
1648.0,1651.0," But if you do it, we'll be there to argue with you to talk to you."
1651.0,1656.0," Oh, and before I forget, I know we haven't talked about it a whole lot, but the tech section obviously went through some major changes."
1656.0,1661.0," And if anyone has any suggestions topics they like to see covered, if you have questions."
1661.0,1664.0, Throw them out there on the board. We're going to try to tackle them.
1664.0,1666.0, Are you going to try to tackle as many as possible in the magazine?
1666.0,1676.0, Right. If you're listening and have not paid attention to the tech section of late Darren has kind of single handedly reformatted the section and done a pretty awesome job of it.
1676.0,1681.0," And that was to the idea was, well, how can we get you guys to read this section?"
1681.0,1700.0," And we decided instead of doing sort of the old, let's us review whatever random crap showed up at the office this month to try to come up with a, you know, basically a question and how to sort of format like, well, you know, how do I buy an LCD monitor on what should I look for on what matters?"
1700.0,1717.0," Or the same thing with any kind of hardware topic, right? So they're thematic sections now where we're really trying to make it be very results oriented and and kind of gamer related."
1717.0,1725.0," In other words, it's not just a collection of just hardware tech reviews. They're very much trying to answer your questions. So like Darren said, ask them."
1725.0,1745.0," And this is improvement over the sporadic. Like, here's a video card. Here's a keyboard and here's a and in this kind of sort of comparative vacuum. One of them. Yeah, that's $5,000 gets four stars or this or that. Now you've got a whole bunch and you can say, hey, this is the good part about this one. It's also have to price with the other one. Maybe I'll go with it or I like what they say about this one."
1745.0,1753.0," Right. And and conversely, I had seen some complaints on the board saying that they they missed the hardcore dig in on the reviews in the magazine."
1753.0,1760.0," Well, here's a little secret for you. All that stuff is being pulled straight from extreme tech. So if you go there, you're going to find the hardcore reviews way more than we could ever fit in the magazine."
1760.0,1771.0," Right, because those hardcore reviews that they're right to their missing are just like what extremely partial versions of the ones we've added a way down from extreme tech."
1771.0,1784.0," I mean, like, you know, here's here's the real secret. I mean, if it wasn't secret, but prior to this change over, we were just taking the reviews anyhow and just kind of compressing him down. So now we just get down to the kernel of it and you go online."
1784.0,1788.0," Right. Anyway, that's it. Just throw that out there before you forgot."
1788.0,1793.0, We do have that last question. We do. That question's been sort of burning our eyes out.
1793.0,1803.0," This whole pass half hour. So do we want to ask it cream pies S why does it hurt when I pee and you guys might have answers, but I say star force."
1803.0,1813.0, It hurts hurts because of star force. That's that's why I'm going to sign Ryan why does it hurt why why does it hurt when cream pie piece.
1813.0,1828.0," Yeah, that's what that was my answer because he's named cream pies. Anyone else want to take a gander this?"
1828.0,1837.0," Well, remember, see a doctor. See a doctor. That's Dr. Darren's word to you, cream pies. We hope next time you write us that that you feel better."
1837.0,1842.0, Hopefully it cleared up. Yeah. Since nearly from the gang of CGW and with that we're out.
1842.0,1846.0, We'll talk to you next week. We hope you all especially you cream pies have a good week.
1846.0,1848.0, We'll see you next week.
