0.0,3.24, I put them on as a shark a year.
3.24,5.24, I got me some blue blockers.
5.24,7.5600000000000005," Yeah, Shane, no that's your fact."
7.5600000000000005,8.84, I like the glassers.
8.84,9.84, They go with my head.
9.84,12.44," So, okay, Pasa, I'm being goes in here, senioritas."
12.44,15.120000000000001," I get into your like these, a mullibonita."
15.120000000000001,17.240000000000002, I put them on as a shark a year.
17.240000000000002,18.84, I got me some blue blockers.
18.84,21.28," These are the ones that I really, really nice."
21.28,23.32, These are the ones that I like a toothpick.
23.32,25.72," Can't wait, I'm a tape winner."
25.72,28.32, What the hell is this?
28.48,30.76," I mean, I know we watched it on YouTube before it came down."
30.76,32.0, It was just like a commercial.
32.0,33.0, A TV commercial?
33.0,34.0," Well, that's it."
34.0,35.480000000000004, It needs no explanation.
35.480000000000004,42.16, I suggest we go directly into the final installment of the continuing saga
42.16,43.72, that was called Chuff Love.
43.72,44.72, Right.
44.72,48.56," We, where we last left off, what chapter did we leave off on the story?"
48.56,54.24," The only thing we ever left off on was that I had, I think I had hung out with"
54.24,55.24, their ones.
55.24,56.24, That was it.
56.24,57.52, That was like the last time I ever brought it up.
57.52,60.52, It was the first time being her hung out.
60.52,63.52," And then, since then we hung out a lot."
63.52,67.24000000000001," We had some awesome times, like went out to the beach Fort Funston."
67.24000000000001,68.24000000000001, That was a red day.
68.24000000000001,69.24000000000001, Fort Funston?
69.24000000000001,71.64," Yeah, she took me to Japan town to Fort Funston stuff."
71.64,72.64, Do you know Fort Funston is?
72.64,73.64, Yeah.
73.64,75.96000000000001," Here in San Francisco, it's like a cool place that people would walk their dogs and you can"
75.96000000000001,79.12, see all these people like a hang lighting else or shit.
79.12,80.12, So it sounds kind of romantic.
80.12,81.12," Yeah, it's an awesome beach."
81.12,84.24000000000001, Except that the beach's black from the oil spill from like two years ago.
84.24000000000001,85.08, That's not so long.
86.03999999999999,87.36," But yeah, I mean, that was red."
87.36,88.36, Dead duck carcass.
88.36,90.16, It's kind of take away the whole.
90.16,95.72," You know, sometimes, sometimes things don't work out between people."
95.72,99.8," So there is no good way to end Chaffloff other than to say, it's not like I hate this"
99.8,100.8, person or anything like that.
100.8,102.2, I'm still friends with this person.
102.2,106.0, But you're taking the love out of Chaffloff and all that's left is Chaffloff.
106.0,108.0," Yeah, it's just Chaffloff."
108.0,110.0, Chaffloff is accepting applications now.
110.0,111.0," Yeah, people can say it."
111.0,112.0, It's Chaffloff.
112.0,113.0, I think it's ChaffMoney.1up.com.
113.0,114.6, Is that my one-up page?
114.6,115.6, Sure.
115.6,116.6, It is.
116.6,121.0, I will take nasty photo shops or whatever because I'm sure that's one of those people
121.0,122.0, are going to send me.
122.0,126.8," But honestly, I'm not in the mood to go."
126.8,127.8, Get it?
127.8,129.44, You're opening yourself up to something.
129.44,130.44, I feel bad.
130.44,132.88, Let's back up on second and say what we are.
132.88,133.88," Oh, yeah, that's right."
133.88,135.28, This is GFW Radio.
135.28,136.28, Thanks for listening.
136.28,138.28, It's all we need to know.
138.28,140.32, And this is the August 27th edition.
140.32,141.32, Right.
141.32,142.32, And it's all the usual people here.
142.32,143.64," Plus, special guests."
143.64,148.64," We have our 12-year-old intern, Sammy."
148.64,149.64, Say hi.
149.64,150.64, Chris.
150.64,151.64, Chris.
151.64,152.64," Oh, it's Chris."
152.64,153.64, I'm sorry.
153.64,154.64, It's first day.
154.64,157.64, We were celebrating not so good with random rug rats and the building.
157.64,162.48," But Anthony, the reason that it might backfire if you do this is because I mean, generally"
162.48,167.56, anything to do with women's always been highly suspect on one-up.com.
167.56,171.64," And this is because, you know, we've got our most popular user blog section."
171.64,175.39999999999998," And it's always like when you look down there, nine times out of 10, it's like a pretty"
175.39999999999998,176.39999999999998, smiling girl.
176.39999999999998,178.88, It just happens to be the most popular blog and you look in the blog.
178.88,179.88," It's like, hey, guys."
179.88,180.88, And that's all that it says.
180.88,181.88, Right.
181.88,182.88, But there's like three pictures.
182.88,186.64," But so people, to make a point about that started making fake accounts."
186.64,187.64, They had fun.
187.64,191.32, So it's my space page where they could find like three photos of the same girl.
191.32,194.79999999999998, And then they would make a one-up account thing and then watch how immediately they could
194.79999999999998,198.39999999999998, get more friends with in 10 minutes than they did in their entire like two years of posting
198.39999999999998,199.95999999999998, and participating in the community.
199.95999999999998,200.95999999999998, That's what I'm so sad.
200.96,201.96, There was this other guy.
201.96,203.84, We had a moderator called Zayroup.
203.84,204.84, He's legendary.
204.84,206.84, His name is Ruth.
206.84,208.64000000000001, Is a good way of saying it.
208.64000000000001,214.04000000000002," And he, I don't know, I got word that, you know, via PMs and stuff."
214.04000000000002,219.4, He was trying to get some of our female or supposedly female users to talk to them and stuff.
219.4,224.64000000000001," He was a kind of guy where he would often, you know, he would tell us and aim about how,"
224.64000000000001,228.28," you know, he met some awesome girl and she only lived three states away."
228.28,231.92," And unlike the last one, this one had two kids instead of three and how it's going to be"
231.92,235.08," just fantastic, you know."
235.08,236.24, So people start baiting them.
236.24,240.48, They start making the accounts and posing as women to get them excited.
240.48,242.16, Isn't it pretty much worked?
242.16,246.32," And then because they trapped him that way, they had to get along and everything."
246.32,248.32," And I'm worried about you, man."
248.32,250.32, You're saying that I'm setting stuff up for heart.
250.32,254.76," I don't actually, if, I would say like, I would like, yeah, probably half the girls"
254.76,256.36, who write are going to be Sean.
256.36,257.36, That's the other thing.
257.44,260.68," And the other thing is, in the end, I don't want to meet a girl like that."
260.68,265.28000000000003," The whole thing of Chou Flubs that has to be like, I gather up the courage to go ask this person"
265.28000000000003,266.72, out or something like that anyways.
266.72,267.72, You're lying though.
267.72,270.92," I bet if after this thing goes up, when you see a PM in there and you look, you're going"
270.92,272.72," to be like, did I try to?"
272.72,273.72," Okay, first question."
273.72,277.40000000000003," Are you really, are you biologically female?"
277.40000000000003,278.40000000000003, I can't.
278.40000000000003,280.40000000000003, Or at least are you now.
280.40000000000003,283.40000000000003, I'm not going to try to kick it to know random users.
283.40000000000003,285.28000000000003," I mean, especially, don't rule nothing out, man."
285.28000000000003,286.28000000000003, Especially if they're in local.
286.4,287.2, I can't try to say.
287.2,287.4, I can't.
287.4,288.4, I can't.
288.4,290.03999999999996," No, no, Zayr."
290.03999999999996,291.97999999999996, Speaking of a random one of users.
291.97999999999996,296.03999999999996," I want to get this other thing out of the way too, which I didn't really think we"
296.03999999999996,297.28, are going to have to bring up again.
297.28,299.34," But I want to, because I'm still getting hate mail."
299.34,302.03999999999996, So I'm ready for it to stop.
302.03999999999996,303.32, We should have brought these in.
303.32,304.32, Some of the last weeks.
304.32,305.32, The last weeks.
305.32,309.2, The Anthony GFW radio feed.
309.2,311.44," Folks, it's over."
311.44,312.91999999999996, There never was one.
312.96000000000004,316.96000000000004, You can stop calling us assholes in private email.
316.96000000000004,319.40000000000003, Someone emailed Marcy was all joke.
319.40000000000003,321.76," Who is the head of our sales department, right?"
321.76,322.72, And Marcy Amaguchi.
322.72,323.72," Yeah, I'm a GFW."
323.72,324.72, Let's say GFW.
324.72,325.56," Yeah, I'm sorry."
325.56,327.40000000000003, Different Marcy.
327.40000000000003,328.20000000000005, That's another Marcy.
328.20000000000005,329.20000000000005, We know.
329.20000000000005,333.92," And yeah, so she forwards this email to us and Simon, who's basically the big boss"
333.92,334.92, here.
334.92,335.92, What's going on?
335.92,336.92, What's happening?
336.92,339.76," Yeah, it's a large."
339.76,342.6, Because basically the letter said that we just
342.6,347.88, pulled a coworker on our podcast and flogged the shit out of them and diminished them
347.88,348.88, in every way we could.
348.88,352.6," Russell, like how Sam Anthony is looking now though, maybe it's not a joke after all."
352.6,353.6," Oh, okay."
353.6,354.6, Let's not strike this back up.
354.6,356.92," I'm not thinking about that, guys."
356.92,357.92, What are you thinking about?
357.92,358.92, Just a little bit back on your key.
358.92,360.72," Yeah, this man."
360.72,362.24, I want to talk about him thinking about that.
362.24,364.24, OK.
364.24,368.72," No, but yeah, everyone's on good terms."
368.72,372.56," If people just listen to more than five minutes of their last podcast, I think"
372.56,373.56, there was no doubt in their mind.
373.56,374.56, I made a difference.
374.56,376.0, That's for too this weekend.
376.0,377.0," Yeah, Sean did."
377.0,380.92," As a matter of fact, I'm going to tell you, Sean made me promise on Friday that no matter"
380.92,385.32," what it was, I was going to go to his house and give him 10 bucks for a present."
385.32,386.64, It didn't matter what it was.
386.64,390.88," I had to promise that I would get, I would bring $10 to give a two a no matter what it"
390.88,391.88, was.
391.88,395.88," So already, I'm thinking, any told me that the market value of it is way more than $10."
395.88,398.68, So he said the value to me is like above $400.
398.68,399.68, To you.
399.68,400.68," Yeah, to me specifically."
401.0,404.28000000000003," So already I'm wondering, like, it's got to be a star or a toy, right?"
404.28000000000003,407.32," So I mean, I didn't know what it could be honestly with Sean."
407.32,410.48," Honestly, it could have been like, like, it could have been Star Wars something that"
410.48,411.84000000000003, it could have been something like horrible.
411.84000000000003,414.24," Like someone sent Star, like him a Yodel flesh life."
414.24,415.24, So like that.
415.24,417.0," I mean, so I wasn't sure."
417.0,419.68," But yeah, Sunday, Sunday, I woke up really excited."
419.68,422.8, And I went and got 10 bucks drove over to Sean's house.
422.8,426.28000000000003," And the sad thing was that I saw it before Sean had a chance to like, spring it on me."
426.28000000000003,429.2," Yeah, well, I just put it in the living room when I was like playing battlefield"
429.28,430.28, heroes in the bedroom.
430.28,431.68, You just helped yourself in.
431.68,436.08," Well, well, I watched any of your fun games that I want you to get up."
436.08,442.96," It was a, it was amongst, amongst everything else it was started off with a like a 16 inch"
442.96,448.52, scale thing of Han Solo riding a taunt on still in its original packaging.
448.52,455.32," And then like a 14, 12 inch like re-releases of figures including like grandmaf Tarkin."
455.32,458.32, And it comes with an interrogator droid.
458.4,462.96," Like all the shit as soon as I saw it, I was like the first thing I thought was like"
462.96,464.76," fuck man, I gotta go buy a new shelf."
464.76,470.0," Cause like, I need like a proper way to play, but it's fucked up because my roommate told"
470.0,471.2, me we can't have it in the living room.
471.2,472.84, Here are a fewes as to let me go that far.
472.84,474.04, That's good though.
474.04,476.52," That's like a good roommate, man."
476.52,477.52," I know, but what?"
477.52,479.64," It's gonna be like, I bring, okay, let's say, he care."
479.64,480.64, Let's say I know.
480.64,481.64, I've always loved people that get.
481.64,483.28, Cause what if he's bringing people over him?
483.28,484.28, Right.
484.28,486.08," But let's say like, but what's he gonna matter?"
486.12,489.28," Like, like, maybe he's looking up for my own interest, but I'm saying like the next time"
489.28,491.96, I bring a girl over for Cheph love part two.
491.96,494.71999999999997, It's like I bring her over and the living room looks all like upstanding and then I
494.71999999999997,496.71999999999997, would bring her back into my fucking crib.
496.71999999999997,497.71999999999997, It's all the same.
497.71999999999997,503.59999999999997," Well, the sentence is like, I just shut the door behind her."
503.59999999999997,504.59999999999997," I'm like, you late now."
504.59999999999997,505.59999999999997, It's like a walk.
505.59999999999997,509.59999999999997," It's like, you like walking out the back aisle at a swap meter, something."
509.59999999999997,511.91999999999996, That's why I'm gonna tell my roommate he can't be around so I can always take girls
511.91999999999996,514.12," into his room and be like, oh, that fucking guy."
514.12,515.12, I don't know.
515.12,516.12, All right.
516.12,519.12, So did we want to talk about any games this week?
519.12,520.12, Should we talk about it?
520.12,521.12, We've been playing around so you mentioned that.
521.12,522.12, I don't feel here.
522.12,524.72, I was gonna say do one more thing though before we get to it.
524.72,525.72, Yeah.
525.72,527.12, Which just that may we should say thank you to people.
527.12,531.96," Oh, that's like, I'll start off with Matt, who works at a boarder's here in San Francisco."
531.96,535.96, He was a very cool GFTA user told us that he liked the show a lot and was not creepy or
535.96,536.96, anything like.
536.96,539.36," Well, he's the thank you for saying hi."
539.36,542.76, For coming up with a being rad and saying how much he likes a human fucking man.
542.76,544.76, For saying the bitch he's going up to.
545.28,546.4399999999999, For the fucking candy.
546.4399999999999,547.88, For saying how much he likes the show.
547.88,549.4, He's very cool about it.
549.4,550.4, That's what I'm saying.
550.4,551.4, Like a person?
551.4,554.2," Yeah, in person he came up with his very cool casual just like the show."
554.2,555.2, I thought that was rad.
555.2,559.72," Oh, and also Scott Keating for making that awesome picture with me and the twilight as a"
559.72,560.72, Jedi.
560.72,561.72, I'll post that out.
561.72,566.0, He did a sky kidding as a comic book artist illustrator and he made a personal version
566.0,570.3199999999999, of Anthony as a Jedi fighting a battle with the twilight.
570.3199999999999,571.3199999999999, Wow.
571.3199999999999,572.3199999999999, Twilight Jedi.
572.3199999999999,574.3199999999999, That's the sexy Jedi.
574.48,575.7600000000001," Yeah, he did adjust the studio."
576.7600000000001,577.5600000000001, He did her job.
580.2,585.32, And then like we wanted to thank PJ Sangalang and also Mason.
585.32,586.36, I don't have his first name.
586.36,587.48," His real name, Sangalang."
587.48,588.12," Yes, it is."
588.12,589.5600000000001," Um, I'll stop laughing."
589.5600000000001,590.72, I'm laughing.
590.72,597.84, Both of them sent us candy from England and super appreciated nothing bad.
597.84,601.6800000000001, Nothing like no anecdote about this stuff other than that like everyone's loving it on
601.68,602.68, the floor.
602.68,606.3599999999999," I said, you know, basically tell everyone to come into the office and try stuff out."
606.3599999999999,610.4799999999999, And we have a certain I can't actually know that's part of the deal with I was going
610.4799999999999,615.3599999999999, to say we have a staff member who comes from a former Commonwealth country.
615.3599999999999,616.3599999999999, That'll be fine.
616.3599999999999,620.28, He's from I won't say who it is and he was very appreciative to see some of his old
620.28,622.64, favorites back in within his grasp.
622.64,625.4399999999999, So he stopped his face with some of his view.
625.4399999999999,631.64," So yeah, now on to we played quite a bit about field heroes beta over the weekend."
631.72,636.96," And they'd start off with like, yes, like we also just put up some premium pressure"
636.96,640.56," and as they did with Rory, man, any freelancers for us."
640.56,642.16, And so where did we begin?
642.16,647.0, I think in there we began with a negative just sort of just for fun sake so we can start
647.0,649.56, with the we could start with the you Anthony.
649.56,650.56, Okay.
650.56,654.88," Well, I mean, I had my first impression of playing with that friends."
654.88,658.16, I didn't like it right off the bat just because like I was getting pissed off at how much
658.16,660.36, it took to kill someone.
660.36,664.4, But then the bad thing is is like everyone was taking for every kid someone until we
664.4,667.32, figured out the way to like kill people in two seconds.
667.32,671.16, And now the game's like like I just think that game has some serious balances.
671.16,673.32," Now granted, this is like not even open beta."
673.32,677.88," So I mean, you can say what you want, but just from hearing you and Rory talk, I mean,"
677.88,682.28, it seems like dice has had problems in the past balancing battlefield games.
682.28,684.32," Yeah, like I'm the first about that."
684.32,686.24, The first thing like I want to dress all that.
686.24,689.12," The first thing is that yeah, it people are resilient."
689.12,693.48," If you're used to battlefield games where it's like click click, you shoot people twice."
693.48,696.5600000000001," You know, you go in the prone and hit someone in the head twice and they're next thing"
696.5600000000001,697.72, they're dead and they're responding.
697.72,703.2," Now, there are times when you can have a battle against another tank or you're on foot"
703.2,707.44, fighting a tank or you're just like two infantry guys fighting and it goes on and on and on.
707.44,711.64," And it starts to feel like you're playing so caliber on training motor something or like,"
711.64,714.92," you know, once taking any damage, you're the only way to end it is if someone jumps"
714.92,716.32, out of the fucking ring.
716.4000000000001,721.5200000000001," You really, you're like, what do we all got God mode on or what does it take to kill someone?"
721.5200000000001,722.6800000000001, And that's different.
722.6800000000001,727.36," I mean, the stated reason for doing that one is the accessibility so you can go in and you're"
727.36,728.7600000000001, not dead and you're not responding.
728.7600000000001,732.88," You can have some fun and more or you can have an actual, you know, a sense that you're"
732.88,734.1600000000001, fighting someone.
734.1600000000001,737.32," You're jumping around, you're hiding behind rocks, you're healing."
737.32,741.6400000000001, And another comparison there would be kind of like PVP in an MMO.
741.64,746.56," I mean, there's so much about this game that reminds me of playing, you know, like an"
746.56,748.76, age of Conan or something.
748.76,752.52, But with mixed with the elements of a shooter and I think they're really onto something
752.52,755.1999999999999, there and it could be super fantastic.
755.1999999999999,758.3199999999999, You got some sense for that with Call Duty 4 because you know how they introduced all these
758.3199999999999,761.12, the character customization and different loadouts and stuff.
761.12,766.48," And so people there started borrowing from the lexicon of MMO play like, you know, builds"
766.48,767.48, and stuff.
767.48,770.52," The notion that you assemble a character based on, you know, these attributes and stuff."
770.52,774.92," But here because the powers are all active and it's not just, you know, passive things"
774.92,780.04, passive in call duty's case would be dropping grenade when you die or going in the last
780.04,781.04, stand when you die.
781.04,782.3199999999999," I mean, you don't activate those on your own."
782.3199999999999,783.3199999999999, They just happen.
783.3199999999999,786.36," And in this game, there's tons all the number keys on your keyboard."
786.36,788.76, You assign the different power to.
788.76,791.76," And with all of that going on at the same time that you're shooting, that you're healing"
791.76,797.92," yourself and doing weapons and cloaking and stuff, you get some of that cool, you know,"
797.92,800.4799999999999, aspect you get from like MMO PVP added to this.
800.4799999999999,805.52, But instead it just means it takes so long to play that it's kind of like off-putting when
805.52,810.68," you're used to, you know, the way the pace of COD death or battlefield death."
810.68,816.0," But like, but that's a balance that they'll be able to find."
816.0,817.0, Yeah.
817.0,821.36," All of this every thing that we'll talk about, I'll say otherwise if it's not provisional,"
821.36,826.0799999999999, if it's not something that can be altered and knowing dice it all will be altered again
826.08,830.0," and again and again because with the battlefield series, they continue to patch their"
830.0,831.9200000000001, still issuing patches for battlefield two.
831.9200000000001,835.44, And every one of those patches changes the way that the game operates in some way and
835.44,837.5200000000001, the way that it feels to play the game.
837.5200000000001,839.96," So in this case, I'm sure that's going to change."
839.96,844.12," But the problem now is that we ultimately found ways to kill people like Anthony was saying,"
844.12,849.32," you're like, okay, well, if you spec your character just a certain way, it almost feels"
849.32,853.84, like an X play because now suddenly you can just rip the shit out of every one.
853.84,854.84, So what's the difference?
854.84,855.84," I mean, what are you doing?"
856.6,857.44, You pick a gun.
857.44,861.6," For example, you pick the gun or class and you pick a weapon if you're on the the Royal"
861.6,864.64," Army, which is like the equivalent of the allies, you pick a gun called the broader"
864.64,868.64," it can if you're on the national army, the equivalent of the axis you pick, what it Wolf"
868.64,870.24, Gangs wonderful.
870.24,874.32," And then to make it even better, you get this power up that increases your accuracy and"
874.32,877.32, rate of fire and there's five levels of advancement for that.
877.32,880.12, So you invest all of your points just in in maxing that.
880.12,881.4000000000001, So you're going to let everything else go.
881.4000000000001,882.24, You're going to max that out.
882.24,885.8000000000001," But with just that power in that gun, you win every fucking firefight because"
886.28,887.64, you'll just destroy everyone.
887.64,892.0," And you can and since it improves accuracy that buff, you can hit people, it doesn't"
892.0,893.0, matter.
893.0,895.16," Someone's trying to snipe you on a hill and you're like, oh, look at that sniper."
895.16,899.3199999999999, And you've got like the biggest machine gun firing from the hip and you beat that guy.
899.3199999999999,900.3199999999999, Right.
900.3199999999999,903.04," So again, that's just like sounds like classic."
903.04,904.04, Exactly.
904.04,905.04, Classic MMO balance.
905.04,906.04, Right.
906.04,906.8399999999999," I mean, that's it is like MMO balance."
906.8399999999999,910.88, It's like like the way Sean saying like every explet we found was always like taking
910.88,914.52, one power that was pretty good and putting so many points into it that you're most
914.52,917.6, people are going to try and make a class that uses like a little bit of every power.
917.6,921.3199999999999, And we just find one power and just like exploit the crap out of it.
921.3199999999999,922.3199999999999, That's when it would.
922.3199999999999,923.3199999999999, Right.
923.3199999999999,926.3199999999999," And in fact, what you're doing exactly what they need to have be done precisely."
926.3199999999999,927.3199999999999, That's what I mean.
927.3199999999999,929.68, You need to see that you guys are doing shit like that.
929.68,930.68, So they can fix it.
930.68,934.28, We were in a we were based like spawn camping these guys at their base and never
934.28,939.72," was saying like fuck give us mercy please and I said no and I typed back I was like no,"
939.72,941.84, this is for the good of the game and for dice.
942.84,948.2800000000001, Because another build another exploit build we have is that if you're in a tank you
948.2800000000001,952.24, can you have this wrench power and the basically just auto repairs your tanks.
952.24,955.8000000000001, So we max that out and then we roll in the group with like three of us in tanks and we've
955.8000000000001,957.4, all got this power.
957.4,958.4, So you can't kill us.
958.4,961.4, We can heal faster than anyone can damage us and with the three of us in the
961.4,962.4, line.
962.4,966.72, We just roll in like a posse to their base and just laugh and just shoot.
966.72,967.72, It takes.
967.72,969.1600000000001, It still takes us a while to kill them.
969.1600000000001,971.8000000000001, It's easier to run someone over with the tank than it is to shoot them because
971.8,975.12, even the blast doesn't do that much damage now.
975.12,981.1999999999999, But so all that will get around but here's the deal with dice.
981.1999999999999,984.56, It's always like a work in progress even after the games come out and it's fine.
984.56,988.3199999999999, Like I mean and people have been listening to this podcast for a long time know how much
988.3199999999999,993.3199999999999, I love the battlefield series despite all the flaws and fuck ups it's so much fun to play
993.3199999999999,996.12, and I spent so many hours playing these games.
996.12,1000.0, But to be fair like battlefield two when it came out I mean at first the Blackhawk
1000.0,1001.48, helicopter was unstoppable.
1001.48,1003.28, You're just getting that it was a point machine.
1003.28,1006.08, You get a whole bunch of teammates in there and they're repairing the whole time you're
1006.08,1010.08, flying your guns just like just instantly kill anyone.
1010.08,1013.8, And so we had fun with that and the next patch came out and then they dialed it back
1013.8,1015.28, so much that it was then useless.
1015.28,1018.12, It was only good for ramming industry.
1018.12,1022.0, And so that happened and then same thing with aircraft or so powerful and AA sucks and they
1022.0,1026.86, made the AA just do this like absurd stuff where you shoot it and basically once someone
1026.86,1031.76, pressed the fire button on an AA it was going to hit a plane even if I had to defy logic
1031.76,1035.4199999999998, in the games they don't physics like the missiles would look like spire graphs and stuff
1035.4199999999998,1039.62, and all of a sudden one it would be going one way you'd fly by it and next thing it's like
1039.62,1044.62, roadrunner type shit you know so actually it's like going after you.
1044.62,1048.1, So they're always and they never really got I don't like they ever got it to a point
1048.1,1051.9399999999998, where everyone's going to be satisfied and the deal is that there's so many weapons
1051.9399999999998,1056.82, and vehicles and you have to balance that across you have X many classes and X many
1056.82,1063.06, load out combinations possible and then multiply that with vehicles and then squad dynamics
1063.06,1067.06, and now you've got all these powers to further complicate that balance and then there
1067.06,1073.3, sometimes working in concert so like if we we also found out that we have that gunner
1073.3,1077.1, shit that we were talking about right then another one of us can pick again this should
1077.1,1081.1399999999999, sound familiar to you Ryan from MMO play one of us can pick a soldier and use this like
1081.1399999999999,1085.8999999999999, heal all ability and you buff that out so then you just sit in between two of your gunners
1085.98,1089.7800000000002, healing healing them and yourself faster than they can be hurt while they kill everyone
1089.7800000000002,1093.5, in an instant you know so that's gonna take a lot of time and I think people should just
1093.5,1097.8200000000002, be like used to these specific ones we're talking about are gonna be addressed but there's
1097.8200000000002,1101.26, always I I suspect there will always be something there's always and it's always going to
1101.26,1105.8200000000002, be updated to fix that but it's just bright it keeps they don't keep the game fresh to I mean
1105.8200000000002,1109.8200000000002, it's fun it's fun to just that they're a little nitpick things that like I noticed the
1109.8200000000002,1113.9, bother me too like that there's no assists for kills and it's like infuriating when you
1113.9,1116.8600000000001, spend like ten minutes shooting a guy and then someone rolls up with the last bullet and
1116.8600000000001,1120.46, it's like bip and they said they get to kill or we also found out when we were killing time one
1120.46,1125.3400000000001, time that there's basically no way to get a team kill so like even when Sean was flying around
1125.3400000000001,1128.6200000000001, to play in a me and Roy went and stood in the fields of Sean could ram us with the playing
1128.6200000000001,1134.14, killers it said instead of saying like Sean did a team kill it said oops you had an accident
1134.14,1138.7, to me like I had done something wrong and I was like that's gonna piss but it's not that bad
1138.7,1142.22, you can have fun with it as you figure it out all you have to do is hold each other jump on the
1142.22,1147.18, planes wing right as it come by but that's another thing and that that ups the onion and it's fun
1147.18,1151.02, then I'm like if I'm applying to play them like okay well then I'm gonna go take you out over the
1151.02,1155.82, ocean and tell you jump off and if you don't jump off then all the ram us all down into the water
1155.82,1161.5, you know like that that's stuff's norm that the the the point of this thing there's no reason for
1161.5,1167.66, that not to be in there the battlefield 2142 the engine the latest rev that this is based on
1167.66,1171.5, had it and it worked well and it's like yeah like Anthony saying they need so yeah hopefully
1171.5,1175.8200000000002, they're not just dumbing down the point so the biggest thing the body may be better right now
1175.8200000000002,1180.94, though is that none of the social aspect is there yet so like none of like I can't make a friend's
1180.94,1185.18, list or something like that so like right now when me Sean and Roy want to play together like
1185.18,1189.66, there's only a play now but so we have to hope that we get in the same game so sometimes Sean
1189.66,1192.7, and Roy all get in the same game and then all just have to escape the game trying to rejoin
1192.7,1197.26, escape the game rejoin until I magically get placed right but this again this is a tough one
1197.26,1201.42, later this is a bit of yeah yeah I think it's gonna be good to see the tab they have friends
1201.42,1205.42, tabs tabs and all the way they say that it's gonna work so that like if we're like if we
1205.42,1209.34, form the equivalent of a clan we can just kind of like Halo Party system we make a party and we
1209.34,1214.94, can all jump to another server at the same time so for the stuff that matters like the stuff
1214.94,1218.86, that's not gonna change like I'd say I'm pretty happy with the game the entire time we played and
1218.86,1223.58, we were playing with Roy and Matt James no one bitch did all about the point of view that was a
1223.58,1227.4199999999998, big thing going in everyone's like it's third person what's up with that but just like think
1227.4199999999998,1231.82, about that now right we never no one even mentioned it and it wasn't until this morning I'm like oh yeah
1231.82,1235.82, like that's probably something people want to know about it was like it doesn't matter go like
1235.82,1240.3, like for some reason it's not I mean so you used to it from console games console series no first
1240.3,1244.78, person you can't find if you want to there's not at all always enforce third person awesome
1245.34,1250.06, actually it's for right actually it gives you a better view of people that are around you which is
1250.06,1254.86, like important in that game it's done just a way you play console shooters done you
1255.4199999999998,1262.06, crest so was it what I call you donnie sorry you play console shooters yes so would you be into a first
1262.06,1268.46, person I mean I would you play a first person shooter on the PC have you yeah yeah I would it doesn't
1269.1,1274.46, perspective doesn't matter to me it's gonna be really interesting if this kid stays for
1274.54,1281.02, long enough to actually go to puberty yeah or we reveal that like Ryan this is just another
1281.02,1284.78, voice that one of us can do but we're not gonna tell people who just want to do anything
1284.78,1290.46, any of us could actually do this voice I'd be scared yeah like console shooters
1292.46,1298.46, yes as as as as as as as as far as that foot here is going in like shuncing I do think it's good I
1298.46,1302.14, mean even like today like I was thinking like man when I get home I want to play some more that
1302.46,1306.14, like even all like the little nitpicking things aside which I have confidence that they will fix
1306.14,1310.14, because they would get tracker just like and the fact that in the end it is free to play like
1310.14,1315.66, when did you come out is it this year well it's not going to come out in that sense it's
1315.66,1320.5400000000002, you know it'll have a public beta phase next like we're well and even like where they bring in
1320.5400000000002,1324.6200000000001, more people right so if they gave like for example I don't know if these are the numbers if they put
1324.6200000000001,1329.74," out 10,000 invites and the next they'll put out 100,000 and then then they'll say like this is"
1329.74,1335.18, launch version one I'm guessing at the end of the year early next year I don't know they keep you know
1336.38,1340.06, jumping around with it and stuff but it's a good system and it's got because of
1341.26,1345.42, the the unlocks and the ability to power up and stuff that's another thing if they figure out how
1345.42,1349.02, to parcel that out it's just the right pace to get people so they want to keep playing to
1349.02,1353.66, level up and get these rewards they'll keep playing and when they keep playing that means that
1353.66,1358.46, they'll keep being exposed to advertising if that's how they decided to do it right now there's none
1359.42,1363.18, I don't see any associate because I'm sure people aren't getting to say like well I want to buy some
1363.18,1369.74, ads for your beta you know but yeah a couple other points about like other it gets fun the one
1369.74,1372.8600000000001, difference with the perspective it's kind of like so calm where you play this game with
1372.8600000000001,1377.1000000000001, manipulating the camera where you go up next to a building and then you kind of like use the
1377.1000000000001,1381.58, camera to look around either side of the building or and it also works in your advantage with the wall
1381.58,1385.98, so if you're um and it helps the game in this respect so say if you're infantry with the
1385.98,1390.38, bazooka or dynamite you're fighting a tank you can go behind a wall but because of the point of view you
1390.38,1395.18, could still see over the wall to throw your dynamite over the wall at the tank where it's in the past
1395.18,1399.74, and if in a first person you couldn't you'd have to go peek out the sides or something or just blindly
1399.74,1404.14, so that helps throw the that helps the player yeah and all that stuff's fine um it's just getting
1404.14,1409.02, the classes interesting and if they keep introducing more things but there's two maps right now
1409.02,1413.58, is excited one one is just infantry and jeeps the others like big tanks and planes and stuff
1414.22,1418.9399999999998, and both have their own you know vibe to them have you have you tried the planes yeah they're cool
1418.9399999999998,1422.22, they're they're definitely they're handling familiar to people they're used to battlefield
1422.22,1426.9399999999998, but like cartoony bit they're a lot more forgiving with uh so there's the kind of thing i could fly
1427.5,1432.22, have you ever seen me try to fly like i got to be honest yeah i i flew there playing and i was
1432.22,1437.34, having a really hard time being accurate but Sean and Rory handle and like I flew you upside down
1437.34,1441.26, the world's biggest pros yeah don't let me upside down under bridges when i'm doing it i'm like having
1441.34,1445.42, a hard time like flying in a circle consistently because it's just hard to ease the mouse for me
1445.42,1449.66, because i'm that's the other frustrating thing for me is i'm used to planes being like the god
1449.66,1455.02, weapon in battlefield so it's always been so good to people that like to fly and in this it's like
1455.02,1460.22, if it the plane you could tell what's designed as an anti tank is a combination of like an air
1460.22,1465.02, taxi and an anti tank weapon but it doesn't it even sucks against tanks dude you got to stray
1465.02,1469.9, people for so long for the tank to blow up but the thing the best use of it is to like what he was
1469.9,1474.22, saying i do is against the enemy you catch anyone in the open and you basically like run
1474.22,1478.6200000000001, and pre-poll are you just go down to the ground and drive through them and like oh go up and that
1478.6200000000001,1482.38, that works really well and it plays really well to like the cartini aspect of the game because
1482.38,1485.5800000000002, it looks so ridiculous when you're like three guys are running across the field and then all
1485.5800000000002,1488.8600000000001, of sudden the airplane just comes to whip down and just swoops off of one of them and you just
1488.8600000000001,1495.66, see him dying you're like yeah okay so i'm looking forward to playing more like yeah we're
1495.66,1500.7, gonna play tonight yeah it sucks i would like to play with with you know people listen to
1500.7,1504.8600000000001, podcast and stuff right now but right now it's just a crap shoot yeah because you can't but if you
1504.8600000000001,1510.14, ever see anyone with the suffix of ainess that it's someone in our group so there's a number we've
1510.14,1513.42, already got because you have to make a new account for each character this is so now you're funny
1513.42,1518.22, but it's just like this is how it is so we've got like cozy ainess inhabited ainess probably
1518.22,1525.42, lapsed a it's exploited ainess whatever else is it'll tear triumphant ainess like jubilant ainess yeah
1525.42,1534.78, like people get so that's it you see that then say hi the assholes as gonna say yes
1534.78,1538.22, good it went all of us were running out with their exploit classes we were all something ainess
1538.22,1541.98, and we were all shirtless wearing our underwear with handlebar moustaches that's really
1541.98,1548.7, good we make like yeah like characters that are either they look like the village people say
1548.7,1553.5, their dude yeah or they're like like my guys naked have a grenade earring and i got a whip
1553.5,1558.8600000000001, i'm gonna ping it off my waist i mean it's just all stuff like rory's got to make it out with a
1558.8600000000001,1565.74, bed roll and he always tells us to come with them to live so there's I assume there's no armor in
1565.74,1571.18, class right all that stuff's cosmetic it just cosmetic totally already there's like an enormous
1571.18,1575.8200000000002, like variety of like costumes you could put on and you can tell that they're gonna just keep adding
1575.8200000000002,1580.8600000000001, it so that it's gonna be the most absurd shit ever it'll be like city of heroes where you can
1580.8600000000001,1584.8600000000001, make any random thing you want so how are you keeping track of your your teammates son
1585.66,1591.02, that name here's a really nice head to say name in color okay there name appears right over
1591.02,1596.6200000000001, your head plus yeah in general it's pretty easy to tell where the action's going on i don't know
1596.6999999999998,1601.58, i never have any trouble sticking with teammates this shit is fun man i want to go play right now

1863.98,1868.78, you pay a lot of people been asking for comic recommendations yeah so i i do want to give a few
1869.74,1874.1399999999999, and you might have read some of these i always recommend joe sacco's books he he does
1874.9399999999998,1879.5, it sounds pretentious but comics journalism but he he has a book called palestine and he has
1879.5,1888.86, another book called say fairy a garajda which is uh about uh the Bosnian war and he uh basically
1888.86,1892.86, yeah i mean he did the work that any normal reporter would go would would go and and do and
1894.3,1897.8999999999999, writes his notes and then produces in comic form and i think both of those books are good
1897.8999999999999,1903.74, for excellent i did read palestine but i called it is real that's what you called it yeah i know
1903.74,1912.4599999999998, i saw you grimace when i even said that the joke and act in like fine book the protocols of the
1912.4599999999998,1918.78, elders and designers that is fantastic it's just a bit of journalism um
1919.1,1924.78, and i recommend vagabond to quite a few people it's based on um it's manga it's
1925.98,1932.3799999999999, manga it's based on the novels the Japanese novels where they called Ryan and Mishashi
1932.3799999999999,1935.58, it's like a misashi's cycle or sawger or something
1935.58,1943.34, Mishashi yeah i mean book of five range yeah so it's it's an adaptation of that it's been going
1943.34,1949.1799999999998, for quite some time it's got excellent art it's not your typical you know manga fair like it was
1949.1799999999998,1952.62, you know what i mean by that like you see those books it's like learning how to draw in a
1952.62,1955.74, main but i'm just saying isn't it and the other thing that impressed me and the guy that writes
1955.74,1959.74, is the same guy that illustrates it right yeah that's fucking that's mind-blowing to me so it's good
1959.74,1964.78, and yeah i mean he if it's well-paced the character works like someone and it's like even the
1964.78,1968.6999999999998, fight choreography is just like really well thought out a lot of times in comic books so it talked
1968.7,1973.98, about this before it's just you just draw someone in some like slightly athletic looking pose and that
1973.98,1979.5800000000002, means they're fighting whereas in this case it he very clearly communicates like this is the motion
1979.5800000000002,1984.22, this guy performed this is what this guy did and here's how it's happening i mean it's very easy to
1984.22,1989.1000000000001, animate in your own you know your mind's eye and the recommending vagabond that i'm going to go
1989.1000000000001,1994.54, ahead and recommend lone wolf and cub a lot of the same lines lone wolf and cub is good too i yeah i would
1994.62,2001.42, say that they're both different lone wolf and cub is got apps like like there it's deficient
2001.42,2007.1, in i mean as far as like the the martial arts of goes it gets fairly ridiculous yeah it does you're
2007.1,2012.3799999999999, talking about a guy in that he fights like a thousand people but the stories with his card the stories
2012.3799999999999,2016.06, are pretty good in lone wolf and cub i mean he does some interesting stuff with characters and like
2016.06,2020.46, what the time setting but what's always a stormy about that guy's books they've been publishing
2020.54,2026.06, that same teams uh other it's like something that assassin is some other like ninja book but
2026.06,2030.3, it's basically there's overlapping characters same art same writer but there's just this kind of like
2031.1000000000001,2036.22, i don't know this like unhealthy fascination with like rap scenes and and stuff like that and
2036.22,2041.74, like as books happen over and over again not a whole lot in lone wolf and cub well yeah another is there's
2041.74,2047.02, a lot there's a lot of like really i mean which is fine you could do something with it and say
2047.02,2051.18, something about it but at times it seems like it's almost just there to be titillating and those are
2051.18,2056.86, the times when i don't like that guys work but other than that that's a fair point yeah i'll bring it
2056.86,2060.54, out to go back half of the assassin i'll bring in and show you and there's times when you're just like
2060.54,2065.2599999999998, really like there's 15 pages of this like what like what point are you trying to make you just right
2065.2599999999998,2070.46, it's like the artist was like i just wanted to draw some like naked women in some like brutal scenarios
2071.9,2075.1, now i'm making Jeff feel bad hey you start to feel bad you gave me that you shouldn't have
2075.1,2086.46, gave me that dirty look about Palestine i recommend um booster gold oh i can't
2086.46,2091.66, recommend back you up on that one minister gold but to fucking football player for you
2091.66,2097.8199999999997, child that back in time shit booster gold awesome to play football in the past really you like that
2098.78,2105.5800000000004, well shawns kind of kind of a feel reductive yeah it's cool now everything's going to be
2105.5800000000004,2110.78, afraid to make a recommendation without shawnd belittling it never mind don't read my comment
2110.78,2115.6600000000003, well you can do five for it stand up like you can talk to you like i invite you to like just
2115.6600000000003,2119.34, rip the shit out of like one of the books that i mentioned and then i'll like defend it i was
2119.34,2123.7400000000002, telling you why i was kind of being sarcastic because i don't do booster gold man bathing you because
2124.7,2130.8599999999997, you can do booster gold booster huh who's that guy come on let's pretty much like you say it's like a football

2150.8599999999997,2156.2999999999997, the problem is that i read a lot of comics but i almost can't recommend any because basically all the
2156.2999999999997,2160.54, comics i read are passed down from you anyways well we've talked about walking dead yeah walking
2160.54,2165.74, after cities one of my old favorites i don't know if it's still around my promise i quit 10 years ago
2165.74,2174.3799999999997, so doesn't rubber curtain right uh walking guys that guy he does yeah yeah he does and and then uh
2174.54,2179.02, i don't know i've been trying to read some of the other stuff did oh what's it just thought of a
2179.02,2184.06, couple other like ones hit it up uh optic nerve you know unfortunately the publication schedules
2184.06,2189.82, as a regular as it gets like even even worse than Chris wear stuff but there are three collections out there
2189.82,2194.78, and those are fantastic there no non-genre and a superhero stuff it's just about a guy who was
2194.78,2200.38, in Berkeley and so it's always like relationship stories and friendships and just like weird you know
2200.38,2205.98, things that happen in daily life and sort of in the eight ball camp it is yeah that without the
2205.98,2211.02, surreal aspect without the surreal element eight balls get to like that but but the Adrian told me
2211.02,2214.7000000000003, nice stuff and optic nerve is also great for like when you want to get a girlfriend to go to
2214.7000000000003,2218.78, the comic store with you and to like prove to her that like yeah it's not a total like waste of your
2218.78,2224.3, time sure and like now i think that yeah Chris what do you think about that?
2224.3,2228.38, what kind of girls are you hanging out with? there's plenty of girls that think comics are stupid
2228.38,2232.78, and stuff like that i mean i mean i well i think there i would think they're stupid if i walked in
2232.78,2237.82, and i it's not it has nothing to do with like the the gender the sex it has to do i think with
2237.82,2241.58, the exposure familiarity so say like if you're a girl and you didn't have a brother and you weren't
2241.58,2245.98, used to seeing and then you walk in so because because of that it's only you hear about them
2245.98,2250.2200000000003, and stuff it is really casual you never really sat down or read one then you walk in a comic store
2250.2200000000003,2253.9, and you see this rack and it's covered in every single book is got some garrish cover with
2253.9,2257.6600000000003, someone in tights right where it's got a woman who's like cleavage just busting out
2257.6600000000003,2261.82, and you look and you see booster goals of first thing you see a mother fucker in a blue and
2261.82,2267.5, gold outfit you open it up and he's holding like a space football and you would you would there
2267.5,2274.3, be some defect in your gender sex to think that it's stupid? no i mean you just don't i i'm not the
2274.3,2278.78, type of person to judge like before if i don't know enough about it we need to teach you so we
2278.78,2284.78, need to correct that so do you really sure you're coming? wow but what kind of girls do you
2284.78,2290.0600000000004, hang out with that are going to judge you for what haven't i'm not saying like we're not talking
2290.0600000000004,2296.2200000000003, about like passing serious definite judgment on you but i mean you know i mean you're just
2296.2200000000003,2300.6200000000003, for better talking about stereotypical people i mean he's trying to type people we actually make
2300.6200000000003,2306.46, when i was reading a lot of comic books yeah i guess it's not ten years but it was a bunch of years
2306.46,2311.42, ago and i was having this face while i was really into them and and i was reading them on the
2311.42,2316.2200000000003, bar train i was also usually reading a novel at the same time but there was a period where i was
2316.2200000000003,2320.2200000000003, really trying to catch up and i started reading comic books on the bar train and i really felt
2320.2200000000003,2323.98, self-conscious all the time on the train i felt like you know look at that retard
2323.98,2330.3, half the time like that grown man reading fucking green lantern put it guys asperters what's going on
2330.3,2335.34, i always thought i won't read comics on on i don't know why and like why should you care the
2335.5,2341.02, right exactly bothered me that i was bothered right it bothered me that i was bothered and yet i was
2341.02,2346.54, then you couldn't help it right i'm not with i sort of kind of want to look up and like yeah what
2346.54,2350.86, i do have a question about i want to Berkeley fuck you yeah okay i got a clear reading
2350.86,2354.94, literature i do have a question about a comic because i'm hoping when you guys can answer
2354.94,2359.42, because uh or no if it's good because there was a punish or series that i think was done by the
2359.42,2363.98, same guy that did preacher yes and it was outstanding was it outstanding yeah because there but it
2364.94,2369.9, it starts great there is i'm asking is that there about to put it all into an omnibus all
2369.9,2374.86, collection and releases a cheaper omnibus well there's two things to consider for you it might
2374.86,2380.78, be the kind of this is it yeah yeah well actually there are thamis did multiple runs on the
2380.78,2385.5, punish her the first one which you might be talking about was illustrated by Steve doing who also
2385.5,2388.86, that's what i was using this was to disguise the fact that he actually does know all this
2388.86,2395.5, making fun of myself yeah and this first run was uh was more of a action comedy and it
2395.5,2400.46, shared a lot of qualities with the preacher but was not with was nowhere near is good let me give you an
2400.46,2408.54, example the the punishment run has a run in with um with the dare devil in one episode and he
2408.54,2413.58, basically he doesn't like the idea that dare devil that Matthew Murdoch thinks he's he's better
2413.58,2417.34, than everyone that he's a lawyer and then he can live this double life where he can play by the rules
2417.34,2422.38, of the system the court system at the same time he's a vigilante so what he does is he captures
2422.38,2428.54, him and he uses a sonic device that this rubs his super hearing me the handcuffs him and ties him up
2428.54,2433.26, and then he sets him up on a roof of a building and he says i'm about to assassinate this man
2433.9,2440.46, you've got a 357 magnum with a single bullet taped in the air hand and you can shoot me to stop me
2440.46,2444.06, i forget he had something else too so that he couldn't just shoot the sniper rifle out of the
2444.14,2447.82, punishers hand he had to actually shoot him to kill him there was something about it the way that it
2447.82,2452.86, was set up and he said well you know you've got if you want me to not just snipe this guy you're
2452.86,2456.7799999999997, gonna have to kill me and then it got to the point where dare devil is very frustrated and actually
2456.7799999999997,2461.2599999999998, pulled the trigger and of course the it was a blank or something and then he turned it him and
2461.2599999999998,2466.46, was more or less like welcome to my world he let them know exactly what it is to be the punishers
2466.46,2473.2599999999998, into two of the things that the punishment dies okay that's enough of it oh there was actually
2473.26,2476.6200000000003, cool scene he has something like there's some funny shit where he like runs in the spider man
2477.1000000000004,2482.7000000000003, and he basically uses spider man it's like a like a baseball bat and calls it the team up and
2482.7000000000003,2487.26, that is the whole Russian guy right the Russian guy who gets his head transplanted on like a
2488.0600000000004,2493.5, giant woman with enormous breasts yes and it's totally funny but he's making that out yeah after
2493.5,2498.3, this run to our thing is continue he picked up different artists and started it again and then
2498.3,2502.7000000000003, did the serious ones okay i'm talking about the one you're talking about pretty shitty okay
2502.7,2506.22, in my mind i'm talking about the run you were just analyzing I think the other one I think
2506.22,2509.02, the other one I think the other one it just comes with all of them though so all that for me I wouldn't get
2509.02,2513.66, that y'all I'm saying like you could borrow I actually have a hard cover the one I was just describing
2513.66,2518.14, because when the punishers game the dare to wait no it's a punisher when the punisher game came out
2518.7799999999997,2523.98, on like the ps2 xbox hair stuff they sent that to us so I got like an autographed one that I'll give to you
2523.98,2529.4199999999996, fuck yeah I don't like it fine you can have it I have a question though it does uh does uh the the guy
2529.5,2533.26, in that comic does he draw it like exactly like he draws the preacher like does it just like like
2533.26,2537.1800000000003, the punisher looks like the preacher but in the punisher of it yeah when I saw the Wolverine
2537.1800000000003,2541.82, yeah when I saw the Wolverine comic it looked like the guy from preacher with with chops and I was like
2541.82,2546.86, there's Wolverine yeah there's some limits to Steve Dillon's like ability to differentiate like
2546.86,2551.42, certain types of faces like the tough guy sort of thing but what's good about him those is he has
2551.42,2557.58, it like a big range of uh of express you know expressivity so people can actually do things other
2557.58,2566.2999999999997, than like grit their teeth and look like they're constipated so yeah let's take a break from the
2566.2999999999997,2574.06, comics and make a little detour in the games before I I read a lot fun on crisis warhead
2574.06,2580.94, yeah anyone else playing some recent releases or soon to be released PC games that you want to
2581.02,2591.1, bring in for showin tell I've been playing a lot of games I did that I'm so I work in
2591.1,2595.5, her I have it Ryan lot but I just haven't been playing as many brand new PC games do you want to
2595.5,2605.1, break embargo talk about demigod shaking said I'm I'm a contractor right I'm an atwill employee
2605.1,2609.82, everything that we've been playing is basically things we can't talk about that kind of sucks okay
2609.9,2615.6600000000003, well I forgot to talk about crisis warhead last time we should say that demigod we can talk about that next
2615.6600000000003,2623.5800000000004, week and I'll be able to break embargo on uh or I think embargo is up on a spore and a week
2623.5800000000004,2628.38, longer than that yeah I forget that's what I've been playing yeah you'll be able to sure yeah
2628.38,2633.02, yeah so it's not that we aren't playing PC games it's just there's a lot of shit we can't necessarily
2633.02,2636.94, talk about right now yeah hurts it hurts not to be a lot and we've been playing a lot of PC games
2636.94,2640.7000000000003, but it's the same I'll shit no one wants to hear about like company heroes and all that sort of stuff I mean
2640.7000000000003,2644.78, for us company heroes world of workout for right dog I've been playing some more wow as well
2644.78,2649.02, like I got to admit like once during that time when your computer was broken and our vent channel
2649.02,2654.46, kind of died you get the witch how about the war hammer beta uh now we keep getting barked at on a
2654.46,2659.34, couple forums for not talking about it on this but I'm not in that beta well we've been talking
2659.34,2664.06, about it on legendary thread so I haven't wanted to double dip right this is my guest yeah I've had
2664.06,2670.54, users p-m-ing me about why what's over do I plan all that but we really need so there's only been a couple
2670.54,2676.2999999999997, so I mean it's been one of two literally we really need to play red alert three we have I know like
2676.2999999999997,2681.42, Anthony Jeff we all have the beta install the first we weren't able to get it to work there was some
2681.42,2687.1, sort of problem with our EA like IDs and it just would work that's been resolved and now
2687.82,2691.82, we need to play it but excuses I think we've been playing Battlefield Heroes another thing for me is like
2691.9,2697.02, every time we go to consider it where other playing company heroes or something and it always happens
2697.02,2702.6200000000003, everything's up all the time where it's like that game just like changed my expectations for like
2702.6200000000003,2707.26, the way those kind of games can work that when other people in the game were like yeah it's just like
2707.26,2711.7400000000002, every other yeah yeah yeah yeah and like you do this and this and like as soon as it starts breaking
2711.7400000000002,2716.3, breaking it down we're all just like yeah well I haven't honestly haven't seen red alert three
2716.38,2723.5, it also I don't want to judge but this series does historically have a reputation for ignoring
2724.6200000000003,2730.0600000000004, whatever recent RTS developments are around at the time and just doing its own same thing right so
2730.0600000000004,2734.46, that's the one occasion that's it but yes that's that I do want to do it right but just hear a lot of
2734.46,2739.7400000000002, like front from our friends it's the usual like yes just another game where you build as much
2739.7400000000002,2744.38, shit as you can and all throw it in throw it at each other and see what's left standing and I'm sure
2744.46,2748.78, that's probably not about to play it so we will play it here on this podcast like we will
2748.78,2752.06, I like like RTS like that but it's like you're saying like once you play something like
2752.06,2756.06, company heroes where there's so many nuances of terrain and the ability to retreat and stuff
2756.06,2760.54, it just changes the way that you want to play in RTS so I'm sure it's good and it's own right
2760.54,2765.1, it's just that it might not be the best and it's like in a subjective too like so if you absolutely
2765.1,2770.3, love the kind of games that we're talking about if you love you know a command and conquer in general
2770.3,2775.7400000000002, that sort of thing like you know you love it you know and then the kind of for me it's like
2775.7400000000002,2780.38, I really wasn't into RTS so it was like the company heroes mode was like here's a way to get into
2780.38,2786.3, it you know it's different but so okay so for Chris this war had I just played I mean I have played
2786.3,2790.86, at E3 I played a level of the single player but for the multiplayer that I played recently
2791.6600000000003,2795.5800000000004, I was it was just a quick enough team death match now they they are also
2796.14,2801.8199999999997, revising the existing power struggle mode and some of the other content I didn't get to see that but what I played
2803.42,2809.66, it really seemed like a matter of them just acknowledging that just what people want from competitive
2809.66,2814.22, online shooters has been changing and it's not so much brining about how many people you can
2814.22,2819.2599999999998, have in the game which is interesting for me to see that with resistance to and console they're
2819.2599999999998,2823.2599999999998, still going in that direction they're still going to try that where like the big bullet points to
2823.26,2829.34, boast about or size and the breadth of vehicles and things like that you know and power struggle
2829.34,2834.94, I mean there's probably a number of reasons why I didn't really catch on but I mean I'm not saying
2834.94,2839.42, it was a failure anything but I mean by really catch on meaning giving like COD-48 team fortress
2839.42,2843.26, two around for their money if you're at a look online and see how many people were in servers
2843.26,2847.5800000000004, actively playing the game at any time um that doesn't because it didn't match it doesn't mean it's
2847.66,2853.74, failure but um but for whatever reasons like it looks like now they're saying yeah let's dial it back
2853.74,2857.9, and let's just have these like smaller maps where it's just the infantry stuff and
2859.1,2864.14, what least include that version of the game in ours and so it's pretty straightforward I mean there's
2864.14,2868.2999999999997, not so much to say about it other than what you might expect it because you have the suit and it's
2868.2999999999997,2873.66, got the different it's got the four power settings on it that you can you know so you can put
2873.66,2877.2599999999998, on strength and you can jump really high so they'll make some maps where there's like a lot of
2877.26,2882.3, verticality and then it's in your benefit to be able to jump up and down a lot and I like that
2882.3,2886.7000000000003, kind of kind of map I mean there's a really cool team fortress two I mean a half life two death match
2886.7000000000003,2891.7400000000002, map called Avalan that was those user made but it was made by a guy who had like a lot of experience
2891.7400000000002,2898.0600000000004, mapping for quake and and um doom and counter striking all this other stuff and it was basically like
2898.0600000000004,2902.6200000000003, this floating castle and whenever you jump off the side of it you'd land on the top of the map
2902.7,2907.3399999999997, and so the whole thing worked by like people basically jumping down like imagine like a giant wedding
2907.3399999999997,2911.1, cake and going up and down the thing and when they jump off the side of it then they come back
2911.1,2914.54, down on the top and there's a really fun map and that kind of one of the maps kind of had that
2914.54,2918.54, feel to it where it's like king of the hill you know you're always like you can transit back and
2918.54,2923.8199999999997, forth and another one sort of privileged people who could use cloaking effectively because otherwise
2923.8199999999997,2928.7799999999997, you're gonna get sniped you know there's like big field of fire and stuff but the game is still kind
2928.78,2933.9, of like I think performance more and more it's proving to me like in multiplayer games is like really
2933.9,2938.5400000000004, one of the most important things like I'm already having I think I already like know I like
2939.26,2944.2200000000003, battlefield heroes more than crisis multipliers weird as that seems because it's just stable you know
2944.2200000000003,2948.2200000000003, and then same thing we we've been playing cd for some more and that's so refresh why does that seem
2948.2200000000003,2954.7000000000003, weird to you it doesn't seem weird I guess like maybe just you know this is pattern just
2955.2599999999998,2961.02, babbling but just because balfaid is being made for that right whereas crisis yes in the
2961.02,2967.02, multiplayer more secondary to it is it is single player campaign and also to say to say that one of our
2967.02,2971.66, like most you know one of our priorities is going to be performance just like infinity world and
2971.66,2976.3799999999997, they said we're going to make sure this game is always running at sixty frames per second or something and
2976.3799999999997,2981.5, the payoff is great there is and when you play I mean it just everything just feels right every
2981.5,2985.9, new once just feels right and worse like you know playing this and granted I was playing against
2985.9,2990.78, people in Germany so we're going to have some problem there even on the years internal internet
2990.78,2994.14, connection which is super fast I mean you're going to have some latency things but aside from
2994.14,2999.1, the latency and as far as I able to differentiate what was paying and then what was like hardware
2999.1,3005.74, performance is just it's just now and then it kind of starts to chug a little bit and then just you
3005.74,3009.98, know you're aware that you're not playing it at full settings which is another thing that's kind
3009.98,3014.86, of weird like I don't know for me now when I'm playing game and I know that it can look so much
3014.86,3019.82, better but I just don't dare do it no matter what the computer I'm on because it's going to like
3019.82,3025.02, start to like eat into my performance that's kind of annoying yeah so it was fun I think it was
3025.02,3028.7, fun but I mean my my impression when I said in the preview also is that it's just the difference
3028.7,3033.7400000000002, between the great kind of multiplayer game like you know CD4 and it works too where we're like
3033.7400000000002,3037.5, constantly like what are we doing and it's just very naturally say well let's let's go play an
3037.5,3041.34, hour this you know and then the kind that's like this is cool but it's not you're not going to
3041.34,3046.14, devote yourself to it you know there's always a whole class of first person shooters where
3046.7,3053.34, they put in the multiplayer and I kind of always wonder why you know just sort of feels like they did
3053.34,3058.62, it for like the box you know for the bullet point on the box not not to dismiss it outright I mean
3058.62,3063.1, maybe they have some good ideas with some good maps but I always sort of feel like look if you're
3063.18,3069.42, not going to be called duty 4 or team fortress or battlefield if you if you can't compete on that level
3069.42,3072.86, then don't bother because there's not going to be enough guys who are going to want to get on the
3072.86,3077.3399999999997, server to know and we'll play it you know there's already awesome games out there and it's just the
3077.3399999999997,3081.74, same as like you can't just come up with some sort of half-assed in my mind because everybody can
3081.74,3086.7799999999997, already play wow so like I would say why don't you just commit yourself to the to the awesome
3086.7799999999997,3090.7, single player campaign unless you're really going to come up with something cool and not to player
3090.7,3095.8999999999996, like call duty 4 like call the war is came out and turning point stuff those games have multiplayer modes
3095.8999999999996,3100.62, it's like a murder but no one's even playing right and so why bother why put the resources into
3100.62,3104.06, that when you're going to get 12 guys sitting on there and just look look what happens when you
3104.06,3108.46, don't though then the same people I mean not not literally but you know people in this building like
3108.46,3112.54, by or shock right I think it was why I didn't have multiplayer and it's like where's the multiplayer
3112.54,3116.22, where's the multiplayer and then darkness comes out and it's got shitty multiplayer and then half of
3116.22,3120.3799999999997, their reviews are taking up with people saying the multiplayer sucks yeah it's it's a
3120.3799999999997,3126.3799999999997, 99 to me I mean there's sometimes there games that that like have like a decent enough multiplayer
3126.3799999999997,3131.66, that it just adds like a little extra fun to the game like a lost planet I thought the single player
3131.66,3136.54, was fun I had a good time with it but I also occasionally like to pop in the multiplayer and play it
3136.54,3140.2999999999997, casually I was never it was never like good enough to get me hardcore but it was fun that it was
3140.2999999999997,3144.8599999999997, there I guess but I wouldn't have cried if it wasn't there at all either I guess but when I
3144.94,3149.1800000000003, think like sometimes if it's done well enough it's not like a bad thing it's not cool that it's
3149.1800000000003,3152.94, there but I mean like not from our point of view though like from our point of view like even
3152.94,3157.1800000000003, call war as we played a lot of the multiplayer on that just because it was fun to grief but like
3158.7000000000003,3163.02, but from their point of view I mean how many more games is how many more copies was it selling
3163.6600000000003,3168.6200000000003, I mean I think it's more than how much money did it take and how much time did it take to do that I mean
3168.6200000000003,3172.2200000000003, if it's really really bare bones you just take a bunch of assets you have and you have you put
3172.2999999999997,3176.7, two people on it and I know it can be done like to win when half like two death match came out
3176.7,3182.4599999999996, only two people made that and then there was like almost no support for it right there was just two
3182.4599999999996,3187.74, maps and those maps weren't you know those failed there's so many great options in multiplayer
3187.74,3191.3399999999997, that if you're not going to really try to make something cool if you're just doing it for the
3191.3399999999997,3197.74, hell of it then just don't you know hey so I have a TV show to recommend that great I was going to
3198.22,3203.8199999999997, mention when we were talking about comedy I meant that sincerely great great yeah yeah what is it Ryan
