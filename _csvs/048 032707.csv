20.0,22.0, Well
22.0,29.36, I didn't tell you guys I was gonna do that well see where there's pressure on us to have a theme song now because we're the only
29.36,35.16, Potters doesn't have music and so it came up that we need that music so I realized that that's it this afternoon
35.44,39.24, That I would do this so that we wouldn't have another podcast without a theme song
39.24,42.2, So I hope y'all liked it. I can add some of the free little
42.92,45.92," Songs and garage band of that would be good. Yeah, that'd be good"
46.44,47.879999999999995," Okay, we have a theme also"
47.879999999999995,49.519999999999996," Hello, and welcome"

56.2,58.2, That's kind of
58.92,62.28, Seriously though when you when you hear not to this the other podcast
63.84,69.76, However when you listen to other theme music it's always just sort of like generic sort of like electronic
70.12,72.12, You know
72.12,74.12, Whatever
74.12,77.8, Like the the steel pellet guitar or something in there. Yeah
78.4,79.92, Plane

93.25999999999999,98.96, Let me let me drop a few lines from there. Okay. Thinking either way the paint won't come in
98.96,100.24, It's what they call me
100.24,104.4, I A.T.O.W. This thought to act was created by synophy
104.4,107.12, Pistons he will take over this industry
107.68,109.16, Like put that so you know
109.16,112.75999999999999, I love one of the Steve songs you know that loves it like the music is good enough
112.76,116.82000000000001, But like I know Sean you were like listening to like like days on end just like on repeated
116.82000000000001,119.84," You were at some point. Yeah, it was like it stopped being a joke"
119.84,124.72," Same thing you actually like same thing with hervacings, you know, why do people like the little bit of"
124.72,125.56, Pip-bap
125.56,127.56, That's okay. That's right. I
128.12,131.56, Listen to that one one time it. I just to see what I could do
131.56,136.22, I opened it up in like 50 browsers. It was like how many can I how many browsers can I have it going in it once?
136.72,137.72, For a crash
137.72,138.72, Peter
138.72,140.76, It was like that's a good use how many times are the magazine
141.2,144.66," Well, I did side of the set home. Okay, and then how many times"
145.32,150.14, Consecutively could I listen to it and I started I swear it was like it's like water torture man
150.14,156.01999999999998," I mean I'm not want to talk about drugs, but like it was like I had you know puff purple or something by the time I had heard it like"
156.42,158.42, 12 13 times
158.42,159.72, Don't do that if I
159.72,161.72, But what if
161.72,165.72, What if you looped in like hervivalishes why do people have to fight and then red dog like over
165.72,167.48, But you that's the thing like you to you to
167.48,172.89999999999998," We work together permission to do that yeah, we need red dog like even if I sent that guy if I'm like hey man"
172.89999999999998,176.5," I mean, I like your music and you know we can spread the word about you"
176.5,181.5," We can't pay you, but we can like tell people to go to your you know to go to your site at some point"
181.5,186.79999999999998, That fool it would get you get in it as head that we made a bunch of money off of song and you know
186.79999999999998,190.6, He would get like some yeah cheap ass lawyer or turnier whatever
191.12,194.88," Oh, I wasn't talking back you can't our own unique. Well, I wasn't even talking about using that as a theme"
194.88,198.82, So I just say and like running both at the same time. Well on a computer. I wish to my own mix
198.82,202.48, But we have we could do that it's that we have like we've had ads on here now
203.16,207.5," Yeah, like this is no longer true, you know free you right this may not the first thing you hear"
207.64,214.35999999999999, It might not be me having sung that it might be some add for some lousy indie band or something not that other band was lousy
214.35999999999999,216.35999999999999, That was on before say we're awesome
218.76,224.44," True all right, that's so we start over. No, hello and welcome to the GFW radio"
224.96,229.4, The whole editorial crew of GFW is here and they are as false
229.64,232.72, Ryan Scott Darren Gladstone or EHD or WG
233.88,235.88, Sean Maloy hello
235.88,240.0, Hi and welcome again. We have a lot to talk about as always
240.6,242.6, There's so much going on
242.6,245.6, You always say that every week we have a lot of a lot of time
245.6,250.92, And then we have 10 minutes before we came down to this goddamn studio. We're sitting there email and one other with the hell
250.92,252.92, We're gonna talk about
252.92,254.92, Give you that
254.92,257.91999999999996, You check shit to talk about
258.91999999999996,259.91999999999996, Don't know shit
262.91999999999996,267.15999999999997," Well, we see we want to talk about stalker a little that's probably the hot game right now"
267.15999999999997,273.36, Don't we say hot PC game right now came out last week on self a 35 bucks in some places. That's quite a deal
273.36,278.8," Yeah, bargain that is a good price point. I would have been playing it had Darren not given me a bomb code"
278.8,280.8, I suck so
281.04,283.36, Does anyone else actually played it now besides Sean?
283.36,285.36," Oh, I actually you know"
285.36,288.12, I finally got my computer work and I played some Barry White
288.56,292.48, Said some support of things to my computer get it running on Vista on Vista
293.04,294.72," Woo, miracles never cease"
295.04,301.04, So I'm playing it and I'm really I'm still not that far and I actually I finally got to that under first underground area that you were talking match on
301.04,305.68," Uh-huh, that's some I got to tell you like you know how like you were you kind of referencing this last week"
305.68,308.72, But like I really do know where you come in from now where like you're in these like
309.28000000000003,316.0, You know underground areas kind of like you know doom or you know like a Raven home areas and a half light to and there really is that tension as you see like these
316.56,318.8, Like the shimmering effects around things that are like you know
319.20000000000005,324.48, Like I guess where they just mutant stalkers what are they call the polter guys theme visible thing
324.48,327.28000000000003, And well there's the polter guys which is what's thrown on the barrels and stuff
327.28000000000003,334.32000000000005," It should be then there's also the tentacle face dude tentacle face do yeah, but yeah, they set you up for it because of all the artifact all the anomaly effects"
334.32000000000005,338.32000000000005, upon up on the on the land right it's like a similar effect
338.4,342.0, So it's like false sets you up with false positive and then you get down there and it's like you see that
342.0,350.08, It's actually something running up to your face. Mm-hmm. You know and one thing I actually I have noticed now and I don't I'm still kind of just getting into it
350.08,354.0, But the the broken English is starting to kind of get to me
354.0,358.48, I'm kind of like I'm not really getting into the story as much as I'm just kind of like just dropped me in the world
358.48,362.0, And I'm just out exploring and interacting the things and people and
362.64,364.72, There I'm running into some where you go graphical
365.12,370.56, Mission well not graphical but just weird mission issues like I'll I'll beat a mission and then I'll come back to that same area later
370.56,372.56, And it'll say the missions failed
373.04,379.44, Kind of like defend a base camp and then I it says go claim your award and I do and then I walk away and come back and then some guy dies and I
379.68,384.0," You know mission failed things. It's well, that's not good. I'm kind of trying to figure out what the deal is there"
384.0,390.8, Did you run into this at all shown not that I mean there are I did run in the mission books. It's funny like I feel like I want like just like you guys talk about because I
391.04,393.44, Did like a one-up show segment today this afternoon
393.44,401.12, I call stalker now and it was like nobody was like exactly the same thing and I mean Ryan was talking about some you know a few instances of things like that
402.16,403.92, I mean a second repeat what is
406.24,408.8," Unfortunately no, but you're the only two"
409.12,414.56," Yeah, but I mean basically yeah that I did experience a few things like that, but in the total reckoning"
415.84000000000003,419.04, You know it's hard to get into and I did make a point with there. It's like it didn't
419.52000000000004,425.12, Ultimately it didn't add up to something that bothered my experience or anything and I made the case in point where
425.52000000000004,429.68, When I was on a e-jam podcast before and now this is sort of talking with uh
429.68,439.68, Didn't shoe who's their editor and chief about how he gave years award 10 and in my mind it was nowhere near 10 and I point out some specific issues I had and I was like using as a case of point of how
440.96000000000004,447.12, I mean duh people with different critics are gonna have different respond differently to things and some things are gonna seem like more irritating to them than others
447.92,453.28000000000003, And this is one of those cases for me where I got enough out of it and like you know I was so excited to play it
453.28000000000003,458.0, Here's on my neck we're standing up there. I just I thought about that stuff after I'm like I acknowledged it
458.0,462.08," I mean it wasn't like I didn't realize that that stuff was there, but it was like a whatever, you know"
462.48,466.72," Yeah, you know I was gonna say because I mean like this attachment to this game because I mean like in the beginning"
466.72,472.48, You know when the game was crashing all the time I was I honestly had rebooted that game 60 times with no joke
472.48,476.08, Just because I wanted to keep playing it and I still kept at it and I wasn't regretting
476.56,478.96, Reloading the game every freaking five minutes
479.68,481.84," Yeah, this I was a good point"
481.84,486.32, We were like we were gonna bring this up part of part partially because there was that game spot thread or whatever
486.47999999999996,490.0," Yeah, but it was like kind of the same thing it was like I chose well"
490.56,495.52, The long story short there. There's like someone on our we wouldn't even have known but someone posts on our forms like oh
495.52,499.28, There's some guys ripping on your view over game spot forms
499.68,501.68, So like dumbass I looked at it
502.96,505.52," Okay, and but part of the whole"
506.15999999999997,508.15999999999997, thing
508.15999999999997,511.44, Was that you know when I went to review it I didn't want to do another
512.88,517.76, Checklist of the god bugs and exactly right that's what people are criticizing you for
517.76,521.36, Was that you actually took the time to do some actual criticism rather than
521.92,527.68, The checklist review right so some people can't handle the handle that and they're in their brain part
527.68,531.04, Part of the like every other review that everyone's written yeah
531.76,535.4399999999999, I want a competently written analysis of the graphics on the third level
536.1600000000001,540.72, It could be dangerous to dismiss on on that. I'll say it could be dangerous to dismiss all criticism
540.96,546.0, But in this case when you look when you look at at the source of the criticism it is important
546.0,549.2800000000001, Here's something about the internet. I mean there was a time free internet
550.0,557.5200000000001," Where you know, I mean what we're one 13 year old who just got done posting at game facts and you can go there and these are actual threads"
557.6,559.6, Who was asking if Chernobyl is a real place
560.08,564.96, Can go and say something about like someone else's review and then the word gets around
564.96,568.1600000000001," We end up talking about it like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're talking about it"
568.1600000000001,570.1600000000001," Yeah, it's like"
570.1600000000001,573.6800000000001," That's the world we live in we call it we have two point. No, but basically"
574.24,577.12, Like you could be like a semi literate like douche and
577.76,583.2, Right that the grammar is wrong on this because basically in his mind. I'm I do I honestly do think you know
583.2,586.1600000000001," I mean, I'm not like yes, I'm not above reproach, but in this guy's case"
586.1600000000001,588.48, I think that probably a sense of you know
588.48,591.76, Eight or more words would would be a default be ungromatic old him
592.4,595.68," Just because he couldn't understand it, you know, but um"
596.56,599.92, It's the whole thing that it also reminded me of though is that
600.48,608.08, There's a problem with taking a review that we write for the magazine and putting it online immediately in the way that we do and and here's the reason
608.08,612.0, I mean if you if you subscribe to the magazine or you buy our magazine
612.16,615.12," You might not necessarily read it in order front to back, but"
616.08,620.56, Unless that was the first experience to magazine you know about the tone of writing
620.7199999999999,625.04, You know about the sort of stuff we do and that in the particular issue that this review appears in
625.5999999999999,629.1999999999999, You'll have read at halt or writes for the village voice talking about you know
629.3599999999999,634.4, Rise of gaming documentary is documentary video documentary based on you know different aspects of gaming culture
636.0799999999999,638.0799999999999, Pread the answer Evan Shemoum
638.0799999999999,641.1199999999999, Talk about procedural storytelling with the guys creators of
641.76,643.76, facade and the forthcoming game the party
644.9599999999999,648.3199999999999, The previews other reviews and the context and you get there and it's like okay
648.6400000000001,652.6400000000001, I'm ready for this you know you're mentally in the space of what it means to be gfw
652.6400000000001,655.9200000000001, We we decide these things are this type of writing is gonna characterize
656.32,660.6400000000001," No, we do or something but if you put it online you could get there from you might have got a click"
660.6400000000001,664.24, You might have been in that thread on game facts. It's like is Chernobyl a real place
664.72,668.96, And it would it someone else could say hey another review went up and you click that and all of a sudden you're there
669.36,674.32," Right, so that's this like jump that you made you know and then it is I it is gonna be jarring"
674.32,679.6, It's gonna be like what the hell is this who's this guy think he is you know like I just got done saying google god god now
679.6,682.48, You know you're trying to you know you're trying to
682.48,687.84," Right, you're trying to retain some pretentious conversation about this game you're right it it's taken totally out of the context of"
688.24,695.5200000000001, The culture of our magazine and and you know all things being equal on the web you are just like another click right right
695.5200000000001,697.5200000000001, So somebody does land at your
698.32,702.08, Review they don't know you're writing so from for nine million with your own
702.5600000000001,707.9200000000001," Expertise in the field of shooters or whatever and yeah, could just be well. Who does this guy think he is?"
707.9200000000001,710.96," Yeah, you know you're writing style is"
711.6800000000001,715.6, Different which is of course one of the reasons we actually like you and him for you
716.4000000000001,719.6800000000001, You know because anybody can write the cookie cutter one
719.6800000000001,721.44, That was not what we're actually looking
721.44,724.4000000000001," Okay, what oh in the funny voice. Yeah, I'm also right"
725.5200000000001,730.6400000000001," But yeah, I mean that was like the whole so of course I can a little bother because when I set and no offense to them"
730.64,734.8, But when I sat down to write it you know and it wasn't like a sudden change in style for me
734.8,737.92, But I always say like I do not want to write a certain way and
738.24,742.96, For me that is what I call a consumer report and that's the one that goes down the order and you've got a pair of
742.96,748.72, Geph that says in terms of graphics followed by paragraph that says in terms of audio or hourly speaking or visually speaking
748.72,752.48, You know whatever then you gotta go through it second the last paragraph you put in the negative right
752.48,757.84," But in the way that you're kicking the tires on a car, you know, so to say your car and driver whatever and you're doing a test"
757.9200000000001,764.4, See if the new Mazda's more feel efficient and the better value than the new Nissan or something you know
764.96,767.6, And that goes back to what I was talking about there and as I think
768.1600000000001,772.96, Ultimately we shouldn't be afraid that we that critics that we disagree and that we have wildly different
773.2800000000001,778.8000000000001, Experiences with games and respond to them differently and I think part of it is the way that we approach it as
780.08,781.6, Consumer report you know
781.6,786.8000000000001, Sort of thing is it is partially responsible for that homogeneity because we can all agree that yeah
786.88,792.8," This works or this doesn't work good on that checklist, but once you just once games, you know, I mean and thankfully we're getting to that point"
792.8,794.8, We're most games do
794.8,798.8, I mean I mean my words because we're talking about PC but like to an extent most games do work now
798.8,801.1999999999999, They look good almost all games look really nice
801.5999999999999,807.5999999999999, You know only function stuff we should get to this point now where the other stuff matters and then that's when we have a wider range of criticism
807.5999999999999,810.9599999999999," Well, no way you would have the good move your something well, exactly if it'll for a long for the longest time"
810.9599999999999,812.9599999999999, I remember what was it the
812.96,819.6800000000001," For the squad article you know why is there no lesser bangs of video games? Yeah, and that's and that hit"
819.6800000000001,826.4000000000001, There's a hit stood in the eyes because a lot of the critics out there still kind of stick to that like the checklist as opposed to kind of taking a step back and looking at the
827.52,832.88, Not all I don't want to be like all the shoots says like I wrote that faster because like I have to give props to
833.36,836.64, Euro gamers review was just kick ass. I mean that was a first rate review
836.96,842.24, But I'm so I wish more people would do that now as opposed to like you know just kind of like break the break away from from the from the checkbox
842.4,846.4, The checklist and if they need to find have it have a sidebar with all the graphics bullshit
846.4,850.0, Clearly everyone doesn't want that the people on that form sure's hell don't want that
850.0,855.44, I mean that you're you're probably describing hell on earth for them you know world where they can't just go down that list and see
855.6800000000001,860.24," Right, you know, I mean it we you shine you and I talked about this at the time it. It's entirely possible that"
860.5600000000001,864.08, What might have been best given more time and more resources?
864.32,867.52, Would have been if you could have done a different review or
867.6,873.04, Or the website because maybe the type of review you wrote is only gonna work in the context of our magazine
873.04,875.28, That's the only I was gonna bring up is that you know
875.28,880.0," I'm sorry not always it for the context of the magazine, but the time is also a factor when I wrote that review again"
880.0,886.16, I was writing for the for GFW mindset which means it's not going to be read for another god another month right
887.36,893.84," Which is just crazy, but that also means people are gonna if right I mean we were debating before we started this conversation of Starcours old news, right?"
894.1600000000001,901.12," Yes, that means like everyone is gonna have heard so much about stocker when that comes out that I I really really need to"
901.9200000000001,906.5600000000001," To go and make sure that it is doing something other than the basics which have already been done, you know, right?"
906.8000000000001,912.0," So yeah, maybe I mean that's why I mean that's part of the thing like like it's cool to I mean go into the podcast and stuff"
912.32,916.4, Totally timely and go through the nuts and bolts. This is this thing work in this thing
916.4,921.6800000000001," You know, but yeah, you know, I I want to reiterate something that that you are basically saying which was"
922.16,926.3199999999999, Which was not that I don't think any of us are trying to be wholeier than that about it
926.3199999999999,929.04, I mean certainly not at all other kind of reviews
930.0,938.7199999999999, Have their place and their purpose and you could argue that some reviews of stocker might have been more of a more utilitarian value on the web
939.04,943.3599999999999, Then yours was so I don't want this to be like if W does it right and nobody else does
943.68,948.56," No, we think for we think we tried to do it right for who where who we are and"
948.64,956.56," For our audience. Sure. Yeah, I know I would definitely be thinking about a review differently if I knew it was gonna go up online right away"
956.88,961.92, Like part of what's going on in my head when I'm writing is exactly what's going on in your head. I'm thinking to myself
962.4799999999999,964.4799999999999, What I'm writing here is not
965.3599999999999,967.3599999999999, The first thing
967.3599999999999,970.64, I mean by the time everyone reads this like the people who care about this game
970.64,971.8399999999999, I probably played it by now
971.8399999999999,978.2399999999999, So what I so what I should try to do is like write the last word on it like let me try to sum up what well
978.64,980.7199999999999," You know, that's what we were trying to do"
980.88,984.88," That's why we get rid of scorer's and yeah, if you point for she's a computer gaming"
984.88,986.0799999999999," That worked out. Yeah, that's right"
986.2399999999999,989.5999999999999," I mean, but the theory is still good. Yeah, I just had to discuss it again"
989.5999999999999,991.5999999999999," Yeah, never go away"
991.5999999999999,995.52," No, yeah, but yeah, I think once you put an attached a scorer on to it and put it up"
996.2399999999999,998.0799999999999, online for everyone to see it suddenly
998.9599999999999,1000.56, shifts the context which is in the problem
1002.0,1004.4," But yeah, I do think there's part of it is"
1005.36,1009.84," You know the infancy of the form itself still, you know, I think that"
1010.4,1018.3199999999999," Maybe just the whole industry needs more time to grow up. I mean, there's a threat online about this as well when somebody asked us about our scores and stuff"
1018.3199999999999,1020.3199999999999, You know
1021.04,1025.04," God, we've had this discussion so many times. Hey, I hate it. He beat you. It's very special"
1025.36,1028.0, But you know about grownups stuff. We have all
1029.28,1034.0," All right, well, so let's let's just move on. Okay, all right, just enough that's good. Yeah"
1034.4,1036.4, Okay
1036.4,1038.4, Does anybody pulling anything else? By the way
1038.4,1044.64," Oh, I'm not sure that's actually again peggle finally finally. I find me join the peggle. That game is surprisingly got like legs on it"
1045.2800000000002,1049.44, It does well. It's like a kind of game you like you do finish you could finish it two settings
1049.44,1051.44, Maybe you want if you're you know you're really good
1051.8400000000001,1055.6000000000001," But like just yesterday morning. I mean, not yet. No, it was Friday morning"
1056.24,1060.88, And I was like I made a note to myself to bring the tip of the podcast. I was I get up for work before my girlfriend and
1061.8400000000001,1068.0, I was getting ready. I was getting dressed and she isn't bed. She goes did you say you wanted to play some peggle
1070.48,1077.44," No, look at the hell because she's always asked me to you know, so we should like woke up thinking like I was like all right"
1077.44,1079.44, We can play some peggle
1079.44,1083.2," Like so I don't love first waking big of that what you will, but yeah, I'm curious about peggle"
1083.6000000000001,1088.72," It's important. That's pretty funny. Also, I forwarded you guys the email I got which"
1089.68,1092.4, Maybe it's not the best form to make fun of somebody on the podcast
1093.28,1101.1200000000001," Oh the email meet the right cover story. Yeah, well, you know on my blog if if you haven't been there and if you haven't that's fine"
1101.52,1103.1200000000001, Yeah
1103.1200000000001,1108.32, But on the put on the on my blog. I scanned a cover that that a user on
1109.44,1114.64, Gaming-age forum had made somebody had made a mock game show windows cover with peggle on it
1115.1200000000001,1119.2, Because we've been talking about it so much here and I put it on my blog and I said this is our next cover
1120.0800000000002,1123.6000000000001, And I guess some guy who runs some kind of casual gaming website
1124.16,1128.72, Thought that that was really our next cover because he thought would be great synergy if we covered
1129.5200000000002,1132.88, His games in our upcoming peggle issue
1134.24,1137.68, I haven't rolled the back yet until the middle was a joke. It's all based on
1138.24,1142.16," I mean, I mean, you couldn't have a cover story. I'll pay go that tells you how it works"
1142.4,1146.8000000000002," But if you had some larger story on casual games, give you that peggle strategy guy you could"
1147.3600000000001,1150.8000000000002, I don't know if I deal with peggle with the little unicorn in the
1151.2,1152.4, Butterfly
1152.4,1158.0," Well, it's all based on it's like it's we get a whole other on you because I have issues that's why what's his name? I forgot he has a great name"
1158.5600000000002,1162.8000000000002," The unicorn you're in that it be on yeah, you are in the unicorn"
1163.68,1167.68, Any anyone else play other stuff could for a comeback in because I I'm just remember to have been playing
1168.0,1170.0, Ills thermovic to
1170.0,1174.64, 1946 I mean I get some free where I got some free where I shout out shoutouts for people
1175.2,1177.2," stuff all right, so I saw"
1177.92,1182.4, There's and yet it lives and yet it moves rather for those who haven't checked it out yet
1183.52,1188.0, It was a profile that a free loader a couple months ago or last month I always lose track of these things
1188.32,1194.4, We're basically the all the art style is like it looks like some in torpe construction paper and that's that's all the art elements in the world
1194.72,1198.24, And you control a character to move around puzzles and you rotate the world around your character
1198.32,1203.2," So like in order to play that one, it's cool. It's very cool. So check that what else it also does"
1203.2,1211.2, Do we have a wrong one of those if it were like a downloadable Sony game it couldn't be x-boggles downloadable Sony game or like a Wii game or DS game
1211.92,1216.24," It would have quite a few threads about it online. I bet it. No, but it's actually it's really cool"
1216.24,1220.24, It's a game that uses actual art. It's actual art is supposed to graphics
1221.76,1223.44, In the reason I'm playing the
1224.4,1226.8, Which I make in front of I actually like that idea
1226.96,1230.96, But it's like just the pretty I'm making fun of the predictability of of that kind of thread right
1230.96,1232.16," Yeah, I'm gonna comment"
1232.16,1236.24, So that we have a URL it's on file front on our own always to send them to our website
1236.24,1240.88, That's right and also another quick shout out. There's a game called to jam thing. It's not what you think it is
1240.88,1242.88, Nothing about yeah
1242.88,1247.28, It's actually it's actually a pretty cool shooting game to us to a like a rock soundtrack
1247.28,1251.1200000000001, I kind of operates in the background so you create basically you should it's like a little bit like robotron
1251.4399999999998,1254.8, A little bit like dick dug very simple objects circling around the screen
1254.8,1258.32, You want to create chain reactions by causing things to blow up and then explode into each other
1258.7199999999998,1260.7199999999998, You may have just described every game and
1261.6,1263.6, Yes
1263.6,1269.12," That's the point of it is like it is like it sounds like a bunch of games, but it's just fun. It's all right"
1269.12,1272.56," Well, we just called geometry wars and it's been done. Thank you very much"
1274.7199999999998,1275.9199999999998, No
1275.9199999999998,1278.9599999999998," Anyway, it's anyway, so that that's also on file front and"
1279.44,1281.44, That's all right
1281.44,1285.28," I've been playing in fernal. Yeah, how's that so far?"
1285.8400000000001,1288.08, It's not it's not winning me over
1288.64,1293.6000000000001, Too bad we're gonna have to see. So it's about what kind of game in fernal is some people haven't heard of it
1293.6000000000001,1301.6000000000001, In fernal is a game from a idos. It's a shooter with a kind of over the shoulder perspective like a max pain
1301.6000000000001,1304.08, Sort of things so you so you see your dude
1304.72,1310.8799999999999, And you are playing a a fallen angel some guy who's been booted out of of heaven
1311.84,1313.84, For not quite explained reasons
1314.24,1316.72, It's also not explained why you're carrying a gun
1317.36,1319.76," Yeah, and whether you got that gun up in heaven or not"
1321.28,1326.8799999999999, And now you're down there on earth and you get in was from I inferno from the makers who red spawn
1329.4399999999998,1331.4399999999998," Yeah, pretty much"
1331.52,1334.88, So he's you know
1334.88,1339.68, He's talking about your basic engineering like tough talking you know wise acre
1340.56,1346.24," Game action hero except he's an angel. Yes, I can still got the stuff with it. Yeah stuff like that"
1346.24,1349.68," Exactly, he doesn't say that but he might as well. Yeah, you know"
1351.1200000000001,1356.0800000000002," Yeah, me and every time he shoots you know, he's got that snappy comeback the Bruce Will style comeback"
1356.1599999999999,1365.6," And yeah, so you get enlisted by the forces of evil since you're now falling angel and you you readily agree to that"
1366.32,1375.28, Which isn't quite explained why and then you just go around and you shoot like monks with guns and things like that at least where I'm at so far
1375.6799999999998,1379.84, What about all your psychic powers and stuff? I mean when Darren wrote about it sounded kind of like
1380.8799999999999,1382.24, What was the
1382.24,1384.24, Midway's game
1384.32,1391.6," Cool, so I'm sorry ops. Oh, well, yeah, I've got a few powers and I'm probably getting more because I'm only a couple hours into it"
1391.6,1396.4," So so far I've gotten like yeah, you get the power to like shoot shit at your hands"
1397.68,1399.04," It's shit, you know"
1399.76,1401.76, Fee-sees have here
1402.4,1405.92," Right inferno, that was the casual use of the word shit"
1406.48,1409.84, So what's not so that's not so great about it so far because of what you described it right now
1409.84,1413.1200000000001, You could have kind of used a different tone of voice. I could have used it
1414.08,1421.04, I could you put your up in heaven and you get booted up by God which is like just so metaphysically
1421.4399999999998,1426.8799999999999," Amazing drop that shit Jeffrey yeah, and so then you're back down on earth and you think you know"
1427.28,1431.4399999999998, That maybe now you're like back to life or something because you aren't having a mountain but then
1431.9199999999998,1433.28, Satan in less you
1433.28,1434.4799999999998, Whoa
1434.4799999999998,1438.8799999999999, Isn't that awesome and it's like oh my god am I gonna go from heaven to hell now?
1439.6,1441.1999999999998, Should I do what should I be
1441.76,1444.72, Fighting for Satan and then the answer is yes
1449.8400000000001,1451.8400000000001," Okay, sold"
1451.8400000000001,1456.4, But the whole notion is like turning your body into a weapon your body becomes a cannon
1456.4,1458.48, I mean you're shooting you said you're arm shooting
1458.48,1461.8400000000001," You're the gun for backup, but you could just shoot that you could but you have"
1461.8400000000001,1466.56, But you have a man a you have man on by the way you call it man a which is sort of weird
1466.56,1468.8799999999999, That's gonna matter from heaven not I guess
1469.44,1473.36, So you can't the man it has very good tell temporary teleportation and stuff
1473.36,1477.36, That's kind of neat in fact. I will say in fact so far
1477.44,1481.36, Maybe there's gonna be more stuff coming along. I don't know this is not my review yet
1481.36,1484.56, It's early but that is the one thing that where I finally went
1484.8,1489.44," Okay, this game is now doing something I have not done before in the shooter so yay"
1489.9199999999998,1491.12," So yeah, you you you"
1491.84,1496.32, You aim the radical and where you want to go you right click and then you temporarily
1496.3999999999999,1501.9199999999998, Teleport to that spot in the game and you can do whatever for that moment and then your back where you started
1501.9199999999998,1505.6799999999998," Yeah, that was so there's some neat gameplay tricks that go on with there like taking out a"
1506.32,1508.32, Guard from behind or
1508.32,1510.32, Disabling a security
1510.32,1513.36," Switch or something like that. Yeah, that's kind of that's kind of neat"
1513.36,1518.3999999999999, That was the only part of the game I played in the demo that I had a long time ago and well I'm not surprised that they put that in the demo
1518.3999999999999,1520.3999999999999, Because that's probably they're only good trick
1520.3999999999999,1523.6," Well, I shouldn't say that but this will just rip off siops flat out"
1523.6799999999998,1526.32, I mean there was so many good things in that game like you could take over
1527.1999999999998,1533.28, And assume control of anyone so like if there you know that way that enabled the developers create all sorts of puzzles
1533.28,1537.76, Whereas basically terminal state like you did die in order to make a call there's certain moments right now
1537.76,1544.24, Where it's just feeling like generic shooter to me and you know like like here's one moment that got to me as like
1545.12,1548.24, Like this is this is your game and that was it I
1548.96,1555.28, Around a corner and you know how a shooter will give you like a temporary cutscene for just a second to like
1555.68,1561.28," You know give you a little a little um, you know preview of the upcoming puzzle right"
1561.6,1569.92, So so around the corner and then it switches to the to the cutscene where you see the security camera going around on a
1570.48,1574.08, Swivel right and then it cuts back to you so it's like they're basically the game is telling you
1574.24,1576.08, There's a security camera coming up
1576.08,1583.04," You better figure out how to dodge it. Okay, so I'm like looking at the thing for a second and then I just it's like the Indiana"
1583.04,1587.04, First Indiana Jones movie. I just pick up my gun and shoot the thing from far away and it goes out
1587.76,1588.72, I'm like
1588.72,1591.12, Then you give me a fucking cutscene for that for
1591.76,1594.08, Like a whole bunch of other I mean
1594.08,1597.84," No, that was just like one moment and then there was no other camera"
1598.08,1602.3999999999999," It was like okay, that game is being it's being developed Poland right yeah"
1603.3600000000001,1605.76, It's I shouldn't say yes. I don't know
1610.0,1614.0," Okay, I was just it is it's Eastern European I mean, which is weird"
1614.0,1619.2, That's like the opposite of what we were talking about stalker about how it's just like so not concerned with holding your hand on stuff
1619.2,1622.3200000000002," You know, yeah, that is weird like I mean, maybe you know"
1622.88,1625.76, We'll see that be one just game designers win over another
1625.76,1630.48," Exactly, and then well then you know I read in previous about the AI and so far"
1630.88,1634.56, I mean there are some instances where I'm seeing them dodge and go behind cover
1634.56,1637.76, Which is kind of neat or they'll do a reverse flip which is kind of cool
1638.0,1639.76, But then there's other times where you know
1640.24,1647.2, I'm walking into a room and they're basically just like standing there and I'm probably and I'm like putting a gun to their head and firing in their life
1648.24,1650.24, What's that
1650.24,1654.56, That's a bullet in your head buddy. It's rare and angel that's why like it
1654.72,1659.92, It helps that like a lot of stalkers audio cues. I'm guessing are you know like not translated
1660.16,1665.52, Because what guys is they're saying the same thing over and over again in their parts where they do do that in English like in the bar
1665.8400000000001,1671.6000000000001," Yeah, it totally suck but yeah like in any game. It's always been that way in splinter cells so it sounds like"
1672.4,1674.4, Oh
1675.1200000000001,1677.68, You're right right exactly
1677.68,1683.92," The final keeps you enough, but it just sucks like you know they knew about the new about this exact problem like at least six months ago"
1684.24,1688.88," Yeah, and they still haven't done anything about it. Yeah, and you're right the same audio cues come up"
1689.2,1695.3600000000001, All over the place like you regard this with the context like there's one this long the lines of drop your weapon and like that made sense
1695.5200000000002,1699.8400000000001, Very early in the game when there's like it when there's like an ambush or something from the cops
1699.8400000000001,1705.5200000000002, But later on when I'm in a firefact with the bad guys in the yelling drop your weapon. I'm like no hell. I'm gonna
1707.0400000000002,1709.0400000000002, Sure if you think
1709.0400000000002,1712.64," It's worth a shot so anyway, we'll see in this home pressure not so good"
1712.64,1714.88, But I'm sticking with it and if it gets better
1714.88,1717.2800000000002, I will come back here and I will eat my words
1717.84,1722.3999999999999," Oh, yeah, I just reminded one thing really quick. Have you did you ever play the game second site you brought up science?"
1723.36,1727.6, I remember it came out shortly after and I played preview stuff of it. They're not the final
1728.16,1732.6399999999999, That was one I just so I was game that suffered from coming out a couple months after
1732.6399999999999,1735.76," But yeah, if you could find that on a bargain bin somewhere check out second site"
1736.48,1740.24," Yeah, also you know, I was reading good stuff about the graphics in this game and so far"
1740.24,1746.08, I'm not seeing that either at all this kind of there just kind of there. It has the normal mapping and stuff
1746.1599999999999,1750.8, I mean it's like technically a conflict here's the different the different swing the graphics in the art direction
1750.8,1756.6399999999999," I think is your point now someone someone had claimed it. It looked better than half life too. Yeah, which is a graphic side"
1756.6399999999999,1761.84, This side well big great big accomplishment there. I mean look how old half life's who is right
1761.84,1764.6399999999999," Yeah, but in the art direction side that's a preposterous statement"
1764.6399999999999,1771.12," I mean just from the levels. I've looked at over your shoulder. Yeah, it's like what kind of filestine says something that's stupid right and then it's got"
1771.12,1777.04, The problem of life's just whatever and you know that they've got the terrible like robotic eyes thing going on
1777.04,1782.1599999999999, You know and the mouths that don't move the right way and you know the human modeling is just really bad
1783.12,1785.12, They deep within the
1785.12,1788.4799999999998, Those are difficult those are difficult things to get but yeah
1789.4399999999998,1793.6, I mean outside outside of half life. I don't have like two. I don't know a very many
1794.2399999999998,1800.0," Engines that sink voice, you know to facial animation very well at all. I mean I haven't been able to do that"
1800.32,1802.32, What where do I get off telling people
1804.08,1805.44, I'm so excited
1805.44,1806.72, Like you know do
1806.72,1808.72, Do it halo doesn't do it. You know
1809.28,1810.96, It is the other big
1810.96,1815.28, Big engines haven't been able to do it. You know brothers and armists didn't do it. I remember like that was
1816.4,1819.36, I guess I'm a victim of video game magazine hype
1819.84,1823.76," I read a bunch of reviews and then I play the scan. I'm like oh, I don't see what the big deals"
1825.44,1827.44, It was must have been in a press really somewhere
1827.44,1828.48, Yeah
1828.56,1833.84," All right, so angel nest little more you'll get it and you take a little break a little break"
1833.84,1836.08," Yeah come back with other topics. Well, I can"
1836.64,1838.64, Do you have another game you want to talk about?
1838.64,1843.68," Oh, so it's like known cares because it's an either it's an old gamer. It's a customulator what but now we come"
1843.68,1844.56, I forgot you're so ill
1844.56,1846.48, I L I L the at
1846.48,1852.16, 1946 is a collection of all of the original game and all the expansions that have come out since
1852.96,1857.84, And some new stuff and the point the only point I could make I can't this is a first for me
1858.08,1862.8," So I can't compare it to you and actually I thought about this. I was like okay, it would be utterly useless for me"
1863.1999999999998,1867.52, To review it officially in the magazine at least for people that
1868.0,1870.6399999999999, You know are discriminating combat flights him
1871.36,1877.6," Players and that want to look and see just how this differs from the last up. However, I think my perspective on it is valuable in that"
1878.8,1883.76, It's kind of like a dying breed right and it's the only way you're going to get around that
1883.84,1887.84," By having buying checking some new new players into the mix, you know, which is exactly what I am"
1888.0,1893.76," And here's this case where I went I got you know, I got a flight very nice flight stick for my I think I inherited it indirectly from Darren"
1893.76,1898.16," I got oh, oh, the one that I loaned a christman. Yeah, the site tech one and it's just just awesome"
1898.4,1900.4, It's like a $200 thing
1900.4,1902.4, Could you play it without it?
1902.64,1904.8, I heard you couldn't so I didn't bother first thing
1904.8,1909.44," I hooked it up to that and uh, but I mean all I could say about it really quickly is that"
1910.0,1915.92, It's it's so satisfying in ways that you don't get with other games. It's like a big duck
1915.92,1918.96," You're if your sim players yourself out there you're like well, yeah, we'll come to the club"
1918.96,1921.68, But it's like even doing performing in the most
1921.68,1925.92, Media tasks somehow takes on the significance because you're pressing so when you got damn buttons to do it
1926.56,1931.92," But you're like I just did something like when you take off when you finally take off and you didn't mess up, you know"
1932.48,1938.0800000000002," And we're like the first time that you you get to a serious stall the spinning stall in fact, and then you recover from that"
1939.52,1941.52, I mean everything you're just like
1941.52,1945.28," This is a sense of achievement, you know, and it's actually really cool and and of course you can get into it"
1945.28,1953.3600000000001," You're looking around the cockpit and you're moving all the levers and stuff. I mean, I was proud of I'm taking off in a dual engine planes now and depending on you know the the model of the plane"
1954.96,1959.52, Like both engines are spinning in the same direction and it creates this like this this force that wants to push the
1959.76,1964.88, The plane on the left of the runways you take off so you might adjust the pitch on the left engine slow down slow down
1965.7600000000002,1969.2," And all this cool stuff, but you get to get the hang of it and then you don't really think about it anymore"
1969.2,1973.5200000000002, It's like driver's head when you're when you know when you first get in a car and you're learning to drive and
1974.0800000000002,1979.92, All the shit now that you don't even you don't you don't consider part of driving like if you're like if you drive an automatic
1979.92,1983.2, All there is to do is put your foot on one of two pounds and turn a wheel
1983.6000000000001,1988.24, But when you're 16 and you know what you're 15 like whoa you got to take you buckle up
1988.8000000000002,1992.5600000000002, You just the mirrors and you pull that you let the hand break down
1993.12,1999.28," And all that stuff, but so it's like you know that you got the the rear wheel that you unlock and your front wheels and but long story short"
1999.28,2004.24, It's fun even though my first time I got airborne and it's a couple bombers down and then I was dog fighting
2004.96,2011.6, But just the fact that it's combat I mean there's there's just the more you put into it the more you get out of it and there's just so many subtleties
2012.72,2016.72, Complex these two to it's just like aerial combat and it's so far. It's pretty cool
2016.72,2019.9199999999998, And I think if you if you're even slightly interested you're like on a different experience
2020.24,2026.24, Provide it you have a flight stick of some sort you don't need the one that I have but as long as you got one of some sort of game padwork or now
2026.24,2028.24, It have to be a stick
2028.24,2029.92," I really say get the damage. Yeah, yeah"
2029.92,2034.5600000000002, Like the game is made for it and if you're flying any kind of like plain outside of uh just as
2035.28,2038.0800000000002, Early war single seat fighter you're gonna need all the buttons you can get
2038.48,2040.24, There's actually some some slightly older
2040.24,2042.88, Choice sticks you can get on a lot flight sticks you can get online like
2043.28,2046.64," 30 40 bucks like yeah, that's an unfortunate barrier to entry right there"
2046.88,2049.36," Yeah, it is but but I suppose that's like any"
2050.16,2055.04, Game like a console game where you need that you know guitar hero or whatever it's so whatever
2055.04,2058.8, I mean you like I mean you just to play you know battlefield and about before you two and all these moves
2058.8,2063.12," I mean you like you start keep going do it. Yeah, and you start trying to do the stuff you do in that"
2063.6800000000003,2070.2400000000002, To the same extent without adjusting your engines and stuff and you stall you rip your wings off you set your engines on fire
2070.2400000000002,2073.28, And then there's so many things that can go wrong you like really appreciate like
2074.4,2079.6800000000003," Can perform those maneuvers in these planes, but you don't do it just by pulling back on the stick and and put your foot down"
2079.68,2084.96," One of the pedals, you know have you gone back to a battlefield lately just to see what it's like, you know, you know"
2085.3599999999997,2090.24," Yeah, I usually throw a teamly play like 42 on the all-playing server, so"
2090.96,2094.48, It's different and it actually helped me the stuff I've learned. I mean like moves like yo-yo
2094.72,2099.12, Inverse yo-yo's I mean just ways to close gaps between people keep in your firing zone
2100.96,2104.64," All the technical flat voice stuff, but it actually it works you can even watch out"
2104.96,2106.96, I watched that this is my turn to nerd out
2107.44,2112.08," This is your turn to make fun of me, but I watch that show on the history channel. You got dog fights"
2112.48,2115.52, They got they put CG on that shit make it all fancy
2116.16,2119.12, They show you just how these things went down you got old men
2119.6,2123.04, Moving their hands around when you fast forward actually because Chris been to say hi
2123.04,2129.6," I'm gonna yeah, yeah, it looks like old dudes raven like when you fast forward through episodes of this and uh"
2130.16,2131.28, But
2131.28,2136.64, So even watching that and here hearing them explain you know the ways that they're they're using their vector roles and stuff for the way that like
2136.72,2141.04, actually simulate like ways to odd that the engine and the stall
2141.68,2147.12, Characteristics of like say a how cat versus a zero and they actually work you go in the game
2147.12,2150.08, And if they try to follow you into a loop and you're in a how cat and they're in a zero
2150.08,2155.12," Then they're gonna stall first, you know and it's cool stuff. Yeah, I like it so I'm getting nerd out"
2155.12,2158.64, Maybe maybe come next next game. I might actually be qualified to do a
2159.68,2162.48, Do a review on it. So I'm only bringing Sims back
2162.96,2167.04, You know this who are the magazine used to be heavily similar
2167.04,2168.68, All this you all see with the
2168.68,2170.68, I'm like least
2170.68,2175.72, When we were going back for that retrospective figure like one year would have like five at least
2175.72,2179.36, It's tough or at least when I first started we would actually kind of argue about it
2179.36,2184.2," We'd be like please let's not have another plane on the cover. Yeah, it's not even an option"
2184.72,2191.04, It's not it's not like completely gone. I mean like flight right 10 it was I'm assuming it must have done pretty well
2191.12,2195.04, I mean there are magazines devoted just to right you know flight Sims and
2195.84,2198.48, But that's very different than having it genre full of
2199.12,2203.2799999999997," Of sims totally different. Yeah, I mean and there were driving Sims"
2203.2799999999997,2207.24," I wasn't even three flight Sims in the top five, you know, and I wouldn't even just be flight"
2207.24,2210.04, You know some Marines driving anything
2211.36,2212.36, sad
2212.36,2216.0, Not just those and now saw console ports and pebble
2216.84,2218.56, Nothing like this game on wait and do
2218.56,2221.36," But it's like yeah, I forgot the numbers like you can have like 80"
2221.36,2226.56, I think if I remember I was like over 100 people online and that's some serious dog fight
2226.56,2229.4," And also like just tons of people and co-op, you know"
2229.4,2234.32, I mean just get all big our mod of this together and go on some crazy like bombing run of you know
2234.32,2238.76," Fight or escort and you can get a lot of people together and wow Sean yeah, I know you"
2239.76,2241.76, It's not as cool
2241.76,2242.6000000000004, So we say
2242.6000000000004,2246.6000000000004," Speak narrate each other. Oh, man. I'm getting some terminus over"
2248.7200000000003,2251.5200000000004," All right, so we need to take that break"
2252.2400000000002,2254.2400000000002," Okay, well, right"
2259.5200000000004,2261.5200000000004," Oh, hello, I didn't see there"
2261.5200000000004,2268.44," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live the weekly podcast from the editors of electronic gaming monthly along with the wonderful sounds of"

2293.16,2295.16, Oh
2296.7599999999998,2298.7599999999998, That was a good break
2299.48,2304.64," We all feel better now. Yeah, we're ready to go along this one. We got it. Are we ready for the long haul?"
2304.64,2309.48," Yeah, let's see why derives yeah, we're gonna keep going on. I get the feeling Ryan's getting ready to unleash some"
2309.48,2315.72," Ryan's massive hate best on us. Oh, bring the paint or other son. There's an item here about a guild wars two"
2317.12,2319.12," Oh, boy"
2319.3599999999997,2325.8399999999997, What actually did that item say that it well where the deep did an offering details
2325.8399999999997,2331.7599999999998," Probably would have helped by printed it out rather than the URL to know I got it. Oh, you got it. What's so what did we learn now, Ryan?"
2332.3199999999997,2335.3199999999997," Well, there was a big interview. I think on Kotaku"
2336.16,2341.08," Yeah, they were interviewing Jeff Strange who's one of the lead to the arena net"
2341.56,2347.08," Talking about guild wars two, which is supposed to enter a public beta at some point next year"
2347.6,2356.1," Okay, and the huge thing about this game compared to the original is that it's going to be a persistent world rather than a world full of"
2356.72,2357.72, Interesting
2357.72,2359.56, So fees no
2359.56,2365.88," No, no, they're they're saying it's still going to be free to play wow and how long are they gonna be around?"
2365.88,2368.36," How are they gonna do that? Yeah, how are they gonna do that? I don't know"
2369.2,2371.44, We all said wow and there's also
2371.96,2372.96, Same time
2372.96,2374.96, This going to be multiple servers
2376.16,2383.9," Which you know, I mean it sounds like a big real MMO that's right gonna be a nice or light nut"
2384.8,2386.8, It sounds cool. It's like actually
2386.8,2388.8," Yeah, I mean"
2388.8,2390.8, Pull that off what how
2390.8,2396.6," What ways could you accomplish that? I mean yeah, well, they probably won't tell us now and public no first right"
2396.76,2398.96, There's a little secrets of how they would make that work
2398.96,2402.44," I mean yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was the first thing I popped in my head a lot of"
2402.44,2407.68, Separation H billboards on the hills of Nargoo make or rock to meet by Doritos make that's billboards
2408.92,2410.92, Guild time it war's
2410.92,2412.92," Well, I hope they can do it in a way that"
2413.64,2418.96, Doesn't piss a bunch of people off. Yeah. What do you think Ryan? How play it?
2420.44,2425.12," Well, there are there hard work and over there to read in there. I always got some new guild wars thing going on"
2425.52,2427.52, I think got another expansion
2427.92,2433.52, Coming out for the original guild wars. I can't keep up really what's this one what's this one called?
2435.2,2436.2, I
2436.2,2438.56, The North I think that sounds right
2439.2,2442.8, I believe this was one to feature in another competing magazine
2443.8,2444.8, Over
2444.8,2451.12," Well, this was okay in expansion in that you have to have one of the other ones to play it, right from what I understand this this is"
2452.36,2456.8, a first in that it's it's it's geared toward completely toward players
2457.52,2459.52, Who have already completed other
2459.96,2462.2, Go-bores campaigns and who have a reasonable level cap
2463.2,2468.68," So so I love so I did a little things up. Mm-hmm. They're hooking people up. Yes, oh"
2469.92,2472.24, It's supposedly the last
2472.44,2474.44, Go-bores one product
2475.88,2478.04, They just keep that spit in for a while. Funny they
2478.04,2485.2, It comes along with a lot quicker than other games move on to the two in the online space they've been down from guild wars
2485.2,2488.52, We got to do the math that they move on from guild or I know they didn't but it would be fun
2488.52,2493.8399999999997, They moved off from guild wars one guild wars two before half-light episode one went to half-light
2496.48,2499.0," Oh gosh, you could be right. That would be so red"
2499.3599999999997,2506.2," I know we got to find that that's not the case, but I start counting syneposodes. It could be though if they did depending on when episode two comes out"
2506.2,2511.6, I'm sure we can make that is bad. That's over a full year like this is the point like we were on here
2511.6,2516.7799999999997, We're like you know what episodics a great idea and I still think that and there's still quite a few developers to say that
2516.7799999999997,2518.7799999999997, But give me a fucking break
2518.7799999999997,2521.96, Sorry for that bomb at that is not an episode. That is the sorry
2523.96,2525.36," Wow, you're a hater now. I"
2525.36,2531.7, We're all four I'm gonna bite. It's probably gonna be great and Valve hasn't given me any reason to believe that they're gonna make a shitty game
2531.7,2535.68," Just change the name to happen with the time thing though, but that is like yeah"
2535.68,2541.08, Don't call it an episode. I mean just call it at this point call it like expansion or it's remember our cover of the cover
2541.6,2544.5, It's every three months. Yes
2545.96,2550.44," No, but hey tell tail games is pulling it off"
2551.08,2554.08, Sam and Max they're on episode five
2554.08,2555.04, I've never been a
2555.04,2561.88, Even proxerops to tell tail for actually doing an episodic game and coming through and coming through quality wise from what I understand
2562.6,2566.16, That's what I think funny to our own reviews. I have not like here's the criminal part
2566.16,2570.24, I'm actually holding off until the full season one is done. I'm doing that too
2570.24,2573.16, But I but still I think it'll actually be better
2573.8799999999997,2575.8799999999997, For people who do that
2575.8799999999997,2580.8399999999997," To play it all once I think so well, that's like getting the whole season of TV yet next"
2581.16,2585.24, Or something all lost all in one shot right very different experience
2585.9599999999996,2590.4599999999996, So wait when did the episode one come out this last year
2591.12,2597.04," Anyway, it was like early last year. I can't remember one example. So it's been a wasn't it least a year was it? I just said one no way"
2597.04,2601.56, It did our like spring wasn't there something we did our cover story in the August

2676.7599999999998,2680.24, Some soul searching that this dude's he works in like a deli
2680.9599999999996,2687.52, This goes out to you my man. He works in a deli and so he says it's the heart it's the most bummed out shady can ever do
2687.52,2690.7599999999998, But they let him turn the music on sometimes so we put on our podcast
2691.16,2697.7599999999998, He said that that's his favorite part. He looks forward to every time it makes a lot of shit in there at the freaking petrami cutting machine

2780.24,2782.24, None of its fit for human consumption
2782.44,2788.3199999999997, But the part that's fit for years web is that they in instituted a program where you're able to marry
2788.7999999999997,2790.7999999999997, these characters

3385.38,3387.38, I the probably just more like baseball cards right
3389.54,3392.98, You get a strong rookie here. You get a bonus DVD with
3393.46,3395.46, With a concept art
3395.62,3398.58, So that'll make for a good time a computer screen there
3401.02,3403.02, Click them through those files
3406.78,3408.78, I
3410.78,3420.78, Then if you pre order to get the collector's edition so there's even more beyond getting the collectors so you can pre order it and then you get the ability to reserve your username
3421.1000000000004,3425.46, For online you so so man you get a poster. That's a value prop in marketing
3425.46,3427.7400000000002, I am so grabbing new bariser one one one one
3427.9,3429.9, So we're
3429.9,3438.1800000000003, Bring in this up in a kind of mocking way if you're meeting till if you can inter up are we jaded because we just work here and so we get stuff like that free
3438.5400000000004,3443.28," Would we would or what do we think about collectors editions? Well, or what yeah?"
3443.28,3448.1800000000003, Well collectors editions used to be cool things about have all these really interesting pre-neas in the box a cloth map the
3448.18,3454.8599999999997," Warcraft ones or doesn't right, but it doesn't totally right, but yeah, it doesn't I mean maybe I have to see it"
3454.8599999999997,3459.7799999999997, But like on paper that does not sound right hold on let's compare and what's in the world of warcraft
3459.7799999999997,3463.74, What's in it? It's a hard-bown art book and their art books are all always really cool
3463.74,3469.22," Yes, it's a nice hard-bown and the difference there are hundreds of characters in that game in"
3469.22,3472.06, Right workcraft also probably like
3472.74,3478.1, What's 16 characters in Quake Wars right and also a hard-bown
3478.18,3480.18, Book versus a desk
3480.18,3486.2999999999997," I think we see got something you can yeah, yeah, you get the mouse pad with the map"
3486.58,3491.46," That's all right, yeah, behind the scenes DVDs and there's I think there's all the cinematics on it"
3491.46,3495.2599999999998, Maybe there's more on this disc you get the soundtrack
3495.2599999999998,3499.22, You get the in-game pet right in the original
3499.94,3503.52, Resolution you could pick between like a panda and the mini Diablo and like a
3503.52,3509.48," Trade trading card getting the trading cards. Okay, so to be fair that some of the stuff is similar"
3509.48,3511.48, It does are both washa
3511.68,3515.72, But actually I like the in-game pet that's like one of the things
3517.0,3521.74, I enjoy my stupid little right useless pets and people like that in the game
3521.74,3526.7599999999998," Yeah, but even if you could say this we're gonna answer that people like the shit the trading cards"
3526.7599999999998,3530.98, There's got to be some kid where that art this he puts it on his iPod and in class
3530.98,3535.62, He sits there look at that art like going out the two hours to I get to go home and fix it more
3536.78,3539.62," Hope and that's the kid. Okay. So yeah, you're right"
3541.62,3546.46," Okay, okay, so let's let's say then is there any difference between the Warcraft one and this"
3547.26,3549.26, Why are we why are we giving that one a pass?
3549.26,3552.94," Yeah, because we're in bed with Blizzard cloud maps why are we giving that a cloud"
3553.18,3556.62, Why don't say cloud map if you think there's a lot more tent change a build stuff to it
3556.62,3559.62, So you can like hold in your hands. I okay. I can see why I'm paying extra money
3559.62,3566.7799999999997," It's also yeah, they put a lot of money and Karen to it too. That's everything's nicely done. That's that's just like like stalkers got a"
3566.7799999999997,3568.7799999999997," Cluckers edition that's yeah, I'll pull to me too and that um"
3569.7799999999997,3577.62, I mean there are games where like a big overworld map could help you perhaps you know or like there's just a lot of like different ways to do things
3577.62,3582.2999999999997," You know, I mean you could you could probably I mean if you really are that kind of person"
3582.2999999999997,3584.2999999999997, And I know you are Jeff here in your voice
3584.86,3586.86, You're going to bed
3586.86,3593.5, You're going to bed and you just like look at the you look at your map of as a Roth kind of plot out your your activities for the next day
3593.5,3596.0600000000004, It's really more like I'm trying to memorize it for my dreams later
3596.0600000000004,3600.5, If I look at it long enough before I got a sleep I'll actually be in strankle funnily
3601.5,3605.1000000000004, And I'm screaming if it's just Peter figured I need to fill oh so he can read to a goblin
3605.6600000000003,3609.34, It seems like you could I don't know like you could get some use out of a book like that though. Yeah
3609.34,3615.42, I just keep you know it all kind of stems from like you know the good old days when info com would pack in like all these crazy things to supplement a text adventure
3615.42,3619.58," All right, but of course leading calm collectors additions back then that's just what everybody got"
3619.58,3621.58," Yeah, because they put cool packages together"
3621.58,3628.6200000000003, You didn't have to pay a premium port. I mean isn't part of this just like this is just a scam that's going on everywhere with DVDs sure
3628.6200000000003,3633.02, Right CDs. I think this you know they're just like milking the fans who they know
3633.58,3638.1400000000003, If they pay are willing to pay a little extra because they're fans and they got to get that extra thing
3638.3799999999997,3643.74, Right and I think the difference between like my perception of the Blizzard one is like I actually would like an art book for that
3643.74,3646.54, Whereas like I don't really care about in the me wars
3647.3399999999997,3649.58, And right so there you go
3649.58,3650.94, Yeah
3650.94,3655.02," Individual perception right what do you think is cool for each game right so, but I'm not a wild fan boy"
3655.02,3662.22," And I still think it's a substantial thing that you have like on your book shelf, but it's certainly like you feel like you're getting something"
3662.22,3663.02, Tangibly
3663.02,3666.14, You I was impressed looking I mean played well
3666.22,3668.14, I was impressed looking you know
3668.3799999999997,3672.3799999999997," Yeah, they just looked special but then on the other hand to take father stream"
3672.62,3675.74, We write it's heavy. I mean it's a big thing. You know it looks cool
3676.14,3680.62, Whereas on the other side of the spectrum there's the Jade Empire special edition
3680.8599999999997,3682.22, Which came in the other day
3682.22,3683.18, Which is in the
3683.18,3689.18, I want walk and we love bioware if we you know we've given them nothing but good reviews throughout their entire history
3689.18,3691.8199999999997, This and the game is good itself
3692.06,3698.2200000000003, But this collectors edition or I think they called special edition don't they all right the special thing is that they finally ported it
3698.54,3700.54, So that's
3700.54,3704.3, That very special special special special special is it doesn't play on the Xbox
3704.86,3705.7400000000002, So
3705.7400000000002,3707.1000000000004, And
3707.1000000000004,3714.3, There's nothing in this box of any substance right I mean there's there's a game on DVD
3715.1800000000003,3717.1800000000003, There's a
3717.5,3721.1, Art book but it's not like the hardbound warcraft art book
3721.3399999999997,3724.54, This is like the size of the manual in the little box now
3725.5,3726.94, in you know
3726.94,3732.7, You know just like a staple paper thing that's what they did with the other one of the most shameful
3732.7,3738.54, Special edition ever was for half life too and instead of you know how there's the raising the bar hardcover art book
3738.54,3744.3799999999997," Yeah, it came with a shiny staple together pamphlet of a couple pictures from the art book"
3744.46,3746.46, It was a second
3746.46,3748.2200000000003, It was a commercial if you want to see more
3748.2200000000003,3753.26, There's even a freaking like just a big cardboard box too. It was a big empty-ass cardboard box
3753.26,3756.78," Yeah, and you pulled out and there's just a little jewel case and the floating around in the middle of it"
3756.78,3758.78," It was gross and yeah, trusty t-shirt"
3759.42,3763.1," I felt ripped off I felt ripped off by that one. Yeah, that was horrible"
3763.1,3766.1400000000003, I remember when we worked at the same magazine we worked at this magazine
3766.1400000000003,3769.6600000000003, They're out of business now shone and I did it was called game star
3769.82,3773.6600000000003, There's like there's something Jeremy and stuff now. It's not that one. It was when we both worked there
3773.74,3780.8599999999997, The half life two came out. We both got the special edition and open it up and we're just completely just felt completely ripped off
3780.8599999999997,3785.98," Yeah, I think you're oval team, but see we'll buy it. We'll keep doing it don't you think"
3786.62,3790.14, Yeah suckers that way. Here's where a lot the franchise you like you'll buy it
3790.14,3792.94, Here's what's weird because like people complain you know
3792.94,3795.74, I'm not gonna enough of these limited editions. I would not want them
3796.7799999999997,3802.7799999999997, To add anything to the game that would change the game in a limited edition because I've heard people say I want you to put like an extra map or something in there
3803.74,3807.2599999999998, I don't want that why because I don't want to have to I don't want to have to buy it
3807.2599999999998,3808.7799999999997, That's a quality buy yeah
3809.18,3811.18, What are you gonna feel resentful yeah
3811.42,3815.98, Wonderful. I ever have a point where it's like instead of the special edition that's the retail edition
3815.98,3820.46, Like retailers to try to convince you to keep going as soon as the actual hard copy of things
3820.46,3824.46, Then automatically start throwing all that stuff in and everything else is just the digital
3824.46,3826.7799999999997, It starts doing it with like a
3826.7799999999997,3828.7799999999997, Once-old games about gotta work too
3829.02,3833.34, It's just regular version and in it came like the behind the scenes bonus DVD
3834.3,3836.3, And that's like well I didn't ask for that but that's something that
3837.1800000000003,3840.2200000000003, Was included with it as an extra disc obviously an extra disc equals
3841.1000000000004,3843.42, You know bring me a mf some sort right so
3844.2200000000003,3850.2200000000003, I'm having a shit now with music right now actually where I'm trying to go all digital
3850.2200000000003,3854.7000000000003, But I'm still coming back to CDs because sometimes I just want the stuff that's in
3855.5800000000004,3857.98, CD especially with the box set
3857.98,3861.9," Yeah, there's a book and I've heard that the book is good. I feel like I'm missing out"
3861.9,3865.34, And by by if I buy it one line one day
3865.34,3871.58, I noticed that doing like nothing go too far off topic but like with music CDs that'll include like a DVD sometimes like a concert disk or videos or whatever
3871.58,3876.94, Or extra content that's that's what I'm the sucker and I'll buy the music right I mean that that's what I mean like whenever
3876.94,3882.3, There's a music CD that comes out if there if it comes out in two versions and it's some but an artist that I really like and
3882.3,3884.94, There's the regular and then there's a quote on a quote collectors
3885.18,3888.3, I will always get the collectors just because I'm a sucker for that
3888.7000000000003,3891.42, Thing even if I know that there's probably nothing
3891.9,3896.94," Worth it. I think oh I'm a fan. I got to get the collectors. Yeah, all the real fans to get in the collector"
3898.2200000000003,3901.42, And I'm one so I better get it so I don't want to get that
3901.42,3904.7000000000003, I don't want to get the start with cards of
3905.98,3912.3, Cartabond and the annancy and the other vehicles so you know like hardcore it fans got a spring for that collector's edition
3915.9,3920.54," All right, do we know we don't know about pricing yet, do we it wasn't in the best ever?"
3921.26,3925.66, I don't think maybe it might be available for three hundred and dollars
3926.54,3930.46," Yeah, maybe it's like a dollar more and then suddenly like oh yeah, that's okay. That's great for a dollar"
3930.78,3932.38," Well, it was the best thing ever Sean"
3932.38,3938.86, It was like the the digital version of the box set that you give her free but like what valve does with their commentary modes
3939.66,3942.94," Oh, yeah, I'll see more that it was so cool in episode one and I mean"
3942.94,3946.46," Especially I don't know if it'll be as cool depending on the developer, but I'd love to see I mean"
3946.46,3951.9, I'm looking forward to seeing them in team forches to and in episode two and it would be cool to see other developers pick that up
3951.9,3953.9, That's like that's something I'd pay extra for
3953.98,3958.3, But I want to tell a commentary but like if if there was the equivalent of that quick or
3959.02,3962.54," Yeah, but I wonder how a commentary mode working on a most strictly multiplayer game though"
3962.7000000000003,3965.7400000000002, That's that's what I mean that's kind of a talk about map design
3965.7400000000002,3969.82," Like a shop design or if they had like a training mode, we just kind of like run through the map and like give you tips"
3969.9,3975.7400000000002, The thing you go into a map like on your own or their or valve is working out if you could do it with other people with you
3976.06,3979.6600000000003, But where you're all accessing it in that same context in the commentary context
3980.46,3983.98, And then yeah exactly if you're saying map design just other things about I mean
3984.7000000000003,3988.46, They could put anything in there they could talk about I mean you could talk about the character design animation
3989.1800000000003,3996.86, Bouncing of classes any of that you could technically fit in there and you could trigger I mean they can they can introduce in the way that they did with
3997.1800000000003,4001.7400000000002, Episode once commentary where all of a sudden they bring in character models of like say
4002.46,4007.9, It demo man using this demo jump or something and saying how they tweak it so that these like more useful now and stuff and
4008.78,4012.94, Each also teach new players like for once like here's how to concussion jump and especially
4012.94,4015.6600000000003, Console people get it and know what the hell that is right
4015.9,4017.82, You know what I got to tell you like now that I think about it with the
4018.06,4022.78, The quick worst package if they added some kind of commentary mode like that because like wedge would totally take people to school
4022.78,4023.34, Like you know
4024.3,4028.6200000000003, Explain not just the map just how it wedge with it is all ledger signer. We're Paul if you're listening
4028.6200000000003,4033.34, I know I know I know Paul listen when we talk about quick worse. I don't know if you listen any other time
4033.34,4037.42, But if you're listening you see quick worse when you do your Google search on quick worse
4037.98,4042.1400000000003, And it comes up in our podcast get some commentary man do it
4042.86,4045.1000000000004, You want to hear your voice when you hear your thoughts
4045.9,4047.9," Anyway, all right"
4048.06,4051.42, Do we have anything else this week? We done you got the little questions
4052.06,4054.06," Well, Peter questions or anything yeah"
4054.78,4058.62," How are we doing it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, at an hour and 10 minutes"
4059.5,4061.5, more into my little thicker here
4064.06,4066.06, I think that
4066.06,4068.06, That's crazy
4069.98,4073.34," Yeah, topic dude don't want to add on there the main"
4073.98,4077.42, We didn't even do the main topic yet. Wow. We are so on top of our shit
4078.38,4083.1, All done except for the main thing we were gonna talk right and looks like you're ready to bounce on yeah
4083.7400000000002,4088.46, Well Ryan did come down here with the stuff which was sort of like a some kind of passive aggressive sign
4088.46,4092.86," Yeah, he came down here with his little you know his backpack and his"

4112.780000000001,4116.42, My mom wouldn't let me have Capri sign and now looking back. I just like why
4116.9400000000005,4122.38," Why would you bang? I don't know too much sugar. I make a sugar man. No, but I was allowed to have like you know that of the boxes"
4122.700000000001,4123.42, Like the height

4379.28,4383.4, We like stand up on the controller thing like we jump up
4383.4,4388.5599999999995, So you know your feet are on where the buttons are and yell that every time you did it and they have to jump back down
4389.4,4393.679999999999, When you're playing but then always want to kick us out for that and then like really

4468.28,4471.36, But I was always a kid you wanted to yeah about to say
4472.36,4478.16, Because there's I mean I learned that stuff from other kids. It's like it's just the cycle of life pass it down like I mean that day
4478.16,4480.719999999999, I remember like there could have been an age when you know
4480.719999999999,4486.639999999999, Maybe I was in junior high it was like kite day and I'm flying my kayak my kite the highest and then a rocker
4486.639999999999,4490.5599999999995, Comes by with the switch blade and he tells me to hold the string on my own kite and cuts it and it laughs
4490.799999999999,4495.92," So that day I learned it from him, you know then I go to arcade. Yeah, but that there's no one younger than me"
4495.92,4497.92, Of course I'm gonna hook them up
4497.92,4503.68," Well, I passed up knowledge down but the difference is you you took those lessons and then you applied them and then you know"

4542.5599999999995,4544.5599999999995, We're seeing that
4544.5599999999995,4550.5599999999995," No, right, but really saw that yeah, and then also it's cool to like someone you know how there's always like a"
