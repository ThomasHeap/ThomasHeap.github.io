0.0,9.0, Hello and welcome to the first of our special GDC podcast for GFW radio that would be
9.0,16.0," games for Windows radio. This is Jeff Green, the other in chief of the mag and the host"
16.0,23.0," and I'm here with two of the regulars of the podcast, Sean Elliott and Robert Ashley,"
23.0,29.0," Sean Maloy and Ryan Scott are finishing the magazine, sorry boys and we're here with two very special guests"
29.0,33.0, and I'll let you guys introduce yourselves.
33.0,39.0," Well I'm Paul Weddered, I'm the owner of Smash Damage that developed as an"
39.0,43.0, energy-touchy quite well and moved from Stein to an energy territory and creative director at
43.0,44.0, Smash Damage.
44.0,50.0," And I'm more inspector on the studio general manager and creative director at Junction Point Studios,"
50.0,53.0, which became a part of the Disney family last year.
53.0,57.0," It's great to have both of you guys here, so thank you for coming."
57.0,61.0, I know it's a crazy week for all of us so we really appreciate you coming out here to
61.0,64.0, to yak with us on this podcast.
64.0,69.0," And Sean Elliott, you have a whole page of questions and I don't know you're always"
69.0,70.0, a main agenda.
70.0,72.0," We're definitely not going to go through in any order there,"
72.0,77.0, but it's there for us to get thinking before we head you guys in the studio.
77.0,79.0, But we'll go wherever it goes.
79.0,82.0," But to start off, the one thing that comes to mind that you have,"
82.0,85.0," the both of you guys have in common, aside from both being outspoken,"
85.0,90.0," I think if you as inspirational father figures, father figures,"
90.0,91.0, I don't say that.
91.0,95.0," No, no, but I think if you as great spokespeople for the development community,"
95.0,99.0, you're well very articulate and I appreciate your insight.
99.0,108.0," But you're both now you're working on Warren, you're working with Disney on a venture"
108.0,112.0," and Paul, your past gives about Wolf and the Beast and the Wolf and the"
112.0,114.0, Einstein universe and then the Quake universe with that
114.0,116.0, and territory Quake Wars respectively.
116.0,120.0, So you both have experience or Warren also with Ultima working with
120.0,122.0, other people's playgrounds.
122.0,124.0, And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
124.0,128.0," I mean, is it finding, does it help you bring out the best"
128.0,130.0, new in other ways?
130.0,131.0," You know, it's just different."
131.0,135.0, There's a real appeal to creating something from scratch and it's entirely
135.0,139.0, around the DSX stuff and some of the games I worked on were
139.0,143.0," ground up creations but working in someone else's sandbox,"
143.0,145.0, it imposes some different creative constraints.
145.0,151.0, But if you can't be creative in the game space in a world as expansive as
151.0,155.0, Ultima or if you can't look at some of the amazing characters and
155.0,158.0," worlds that Disney's created over the last 80 years and go,"
158.0,161.0," you know, that's probably at least as good as I could come up with myself."
161.0,163.0, Let's do something really cool with them.
163.0,166.0," If you can't get excited about that, you know, you're just not thinking hard enough."
167.0,169.0, I just thought it'd be really cool to kill Nazis.
171.0,174.0, We all think that all the time.
174.0,176.0, I think all the never get solved.
176.0,179.0, The thing is I was so absolutely in awe of everything that it's
179.0,182.0, software had ever done already anywhere in a massive wolf and
182.0,184.0," stine fan, Doom fan, Quake fan."
184.0,188.0, That when we got splashed damage started and we had the opportunity to work on
188.0,192.0, that intellectual property that's better for us than creating something
192.0,195.0," ourselves because it's like, Oh my god, they got to let us do this."
195.0,197.0, That was really cool.
197.0,200.0," And then of course, because with our first game, it was built on a"
200.0,201.0, return to Castle Wolf and stine.
201.0,204.0, That was already a really strong game with a defined
204.0,206.0, style and loads of media and assets and everything.
206.0,209.0, So we could just focus in on working on the gameplay with
209.0,212.0, it's software based on a lot of the ideas that they had
212.0,214.0, left over from return to Castle Wolf and stima.
214.0,218.0," I think that's a really good point because what he just said was,"
218.0,222.0," how exciting it was to be a part of that world, to make a game."
222.0,224.0," You know, they're letting us do that."
224.0,226.0, That's the way I feel every time I talk to guys at Disney.
226.0,229.0," Every time I go to the Disney Archives, it's like, they're really letting me"
229.0,231.0, work on this holy cow.
231.0,236.0," And it must be a kind of pressure that could be like creatively inspiring,"
236.0,238.0," right? I mean, you don't want to blow it, right?"
238.0,241.0, You don't want to let down either the company or the millions of
241.0,244.0, fans of these characters and these franchises.
244.0,247.0," I mean, I think you like maybe if it's your own thing in some way"
247.0,250.0, you're like a little more free to just fail.
251.0,254.0," Yeah, you know, when we're creating JC Denton and you know,"
254.0,256.0," his brother and the universe of DSX, it's like,"
256.0,258.0, it's not like anybody had any expectations.
258.0,260.0," Now, the second one, people kind of had expectations, but,"
260.0,263.0," you know, when you're working with a New York property,"
263.0,264.0," yeah, you're absolutely right."
264.0,268.0," It's a huge, you know, it's an honor, it's pressure,"
268.0,272.0," it's cool, it's scary, it's everything you want as a person who's,"
272.0,273.0," you know, creating stuff."
273.0,277.0," So, what would you tell fans who maybe heard the news and"
277.0,279.0," don't really know much, well, I'm not of a certain way"
279.0,281.0, know much about what you're working on right now.
281.0,283.0, And I won't try to pry it out of you here.
283.0,284.0, Thank you.
284.0,288.0," But, but people may just get like a gut feeling of,"
288.0,291.0," oh, Warren Spectre sold out to Disney or instead of doing"
291.0,294.0," this great franchise that we love that he created,"
294.0,297.0," now he's just going to do whatever, you know,"
297.0,300.0, a dumbbell game or something.
300.0,304.0," You know, I'm really pretty ready for people say"
304.0,308.0," and that, it seems inevitable, but I just don't think about it that way."
308.0,310.0," I've been a Disney fan all my life, you know?"
310.0,313.0, It's cool not having to explain who you're working for.
313.0,316.0," You say, you know, yeah, I work for Ironstorm or I work for"
316.0,318.0," Orgen, it's like everybody gives you like, you know,"
318.0,320.0," dog being shown a magic trick looks, right?"
320.0,323.0," Jeff Davis, you know, and you say I work for Disney and"
323.0,325.0," people kind of get it, so it's cool that way."
325.0,328.0," And the critical thing is, you know,"
328.0,332.0," games are not about, I can't believe I'm the guy who's going to"
332.0,334.0," say this out loud, oh my God."
334.0,336.0," But they're not about stories, you know,"
336.0,337.0, they're about doing stuff.
337.0,341.0, They're about game play and the context is just that it is just
341.0,344.0," the box that the gameplay happens in, you know?"
344.0,348.0, I'm not going to compromise my sort of design philosophy just because
348.0,351.0," I'm making a game about, you know?"
351.0,354.0," That's not going to change, so I think, I think that two"
354.0,355.0, syllables.
355.0,357.0," Yeah, or, yeah."
357.0,360.0," Yeah, you're going to slow that down and"
360.0,362.0, you want it backwards and figure out what I just said.
362.0,363.0, Yeah.
363.0,364.0, Yeah.
364.0,368.0," Yeah, so it's about, if you really believe it's about the gameplay,"
368.0,371.0," I think, you know, when we finally do get around talking about this fence,"
371.0,373.0," we're going to be pretty pleased, you know?"
373.0,374.0, We'll see.
374.0,376.0," I used to really believe like,"
376.0,378.0, wholeheartedly that the only thing you should work on is
378.0,382.0, brand new developer IP and then I played Lego Star Wars.
382.0,385.0," And you're just like, you know, it's like two huge,"
385.0,386.0, huge franchises.
386.0,388.0, I hate the word franchise.
388.0,390.0," On my big list of things that I hate is like,"
390.0,394.0," skewed to cake, or detached rate, play a chair, and franchise product,"
394.0,396.0," they're horrible, horrible, horrible words."
396.0,400.0," But Lego Star Wars is a really fun game, so it's just not"
400.0,402.0, worth being so anti-establishment.
402.0,404.0," If it's something's fun, it's fun, isn't it?"
404.0,405.0, Couldn't agree more.
405.0,406.0, Definitely.
406.0,410.0," So did you, um, Paul, did you run into any any cases in the"
410.0,412.0," development of either of your games where, you know,"
412.0,414.0," someone it said, this isn't going to work."
414.0,417.0," I mean, this isn't, I mean, because it's pretty flexible,"
417.0,419.0," you know, universe that universe set of"
419.0,421.0, universes you're working with there.
421.0,423.0," I mean, I can imagine, with Disney, I can imagine"
423.0,425.0," they're, they're definite lines and moments when they say,"
425.0,429.0, this does not fit the Bible for this character.
429.0,432.0," And clearly, they're, you know, Disney, they're willing to give you"
432.0,433.0, wiggle room as well.
433.0,436.0," But I mean, but even with with the franchise as you worked in Paul,"
436.0,438.0," did you ever come to points where they said, this isn't going to"
438.0,439.0," fly, we can't do this."
439.0,441.0," Well, we had, I think the thing to appreciate is that when we"
441.0,444.0," had finished, we'll find an enemy territory, we'd still never"
444.0,445.0, made a complete game.
445.0,448.0, So the only reason that enemy territory quite was was
448.0,452.0, possible was because of the masses of of mentoring we got from
452.0,456.0," Ed Software both on a kind of design standpoint, the art direction"
456.0,459.0," and, you know, giving us help with technology and things like that."
459.0,462.0," So I don't, I, it never really bothered me, you know, like if they"
462.0,464.0," stepped in and said, we want you to change this thing, I think we"
464.0,467.0," did, when we did our first kind of drug character concept, I"
467.0,471.0," think we did 50 different, drug character concepts before, you know,"
471.0,473.0, we sat on one that it worked completely happy with.
473.0,476.0," Working with Kevin Cloud, you know, you know, pretty well"
476.0,480.0," Sean, and the thing is that that really meticulous"
480.0,482.0, attention to detail is the thing that sets the quality
482.0,484.0, bar for their games.
484.0,487.0, So you'd be kind of crazy to take on the challenge if you didn't
487.0,490.0," expect to have a preparedness to cut stuff that didn't, you"
490.0,493.0," know, wasn't going to be successful, but the pressure you put on"
493.0,494.0, yourself can be huge.
494.0,497.0," I mean, I remember hearing, long into kind of Val's"
497.0,500.0," success story, I remember hearing an anecdote about why Val"
500.0,502.0," started and apparently it was because gave you, you know, why"
502.0,505.0," sat at Microsoft with his millions of millions of shares,"
505.0,507.0, realized that doing was installed on more machines than
507.0,512.0," windows, and that was kind of his, his, his, a moment,"
512.0,515.0," his epiphany, when he said, I should really be in the games industry,"
515.0,517.0," you know, not at Microsoft, and that's why he left started,"
517.0,520.0, licensed their tech and started working on that.
520.0,523.0," So for us now, the challenge obviously is can we create something"
523.0,527.0, completely new ourselves from scratch and still do a really
527.0,528.0, really good job with it.
528.0,531.0," You know, something you said, if I could jump in here, you"
531.0,536.0," said, Disney has lines, and I'm sure they're there, but"
536.0,539.0, one of the reasons I signed on with these guys and one of the reasons
539.0,542.0, why I'm doing this project that we're not going to talk about is
542.0,545.0," because they really, they, they made a really compelling case"
545.0,548.0, that they wanted me to really push things beyond where they
548.0,552.0," might themselves, you know, and so far, and we've, we're"
552.0,556.0," with these guys for a long time, so far, they really lived up to that."
556.0,557.0," If there's a line, I haven't found it yet."
557.0,558.0, And you got to keep it.
558.0,559.0, You got to keep it.
559.0,560.0, Are they creating?
560.0,561.0," Well, that's it."
561.0,562.0, That's what I'm going to do.
562.0,565.0," Man, I, I sat in a room with some really important people at Disney,"
565.0,568.0," and I had some things on a, on a board some concept art."
568.0,570.0," We're going to make the first, right?"
570.0,572.0," Did Disney, I mean, I don't know about that."
572.0,574.0," In the area, I'll topless here."
574.0,576.0," But I, I'm just not ready to do that."
576.0,577.0, Yeah.
577.0,580.0," I had some concept art that I thought was too extreme, and I put it"
580.0,582.0, out there because I knew these really important exactly where to
582.0,584.0," look at that and go, all right, you've crossed your cross line,"
584.0,587.0," you've gone too far, but this other stuff that's also too far."
588.0,591.0," It's okay because this stuff was so extreme, and they didn't even bat on"
591.0,592.0, on.
592.0,595.0," I mean, it's a unique imprint in the way that say, you know,"
595.0,598.0," comics, I think I wanted to bring up because it's, it's a similar"
598.0,601.0," scenario where you have tons and tons of top talent,"
601.0,605.0, perineally drawn to which can either be a source of good or just this
605.0,608.0," black hole, like a Batman or something like that, but they'll"
608.0,609.0, create these things called else worlds.
609.0,612.0," And that's their way of saying, they're not in normal"
612.0,613.0, continuity.
613.0,614.0, They can do what they want.
614.0,616.0, So it's Disney going to create a junction point else
616.0,618.0, where you're able to do what you will.
618.0,619.0, That's a really interesting point.
619.0,623.0," Disney's not going to create it, but that's kind of something that I wanted."
623.0,625.0, I just looked around at my handler here.
625.0,629.0, I should step in for Warren as handler and anytime you guys
629.0,632.0," you say, you won't get a press in with his stuff when he"
632.0,633.0, you got your mask.
633.0,634.0, I know that question.
634.0,637.0, I think that's a really good approach to things when you
637.0,639.0, really are out there trying to take some chances.
639.0,641.0, That's exactly what I did when I started working on
641.0,644.0," ultimate games, years and years and years ago."
645.0,648.0," I said, I never want Richard Garrett to be able to say that"
648.0,650.0, wouldn't happen in Britannia or Lord British wouldn't do that.
650.0,654.0," So I created the world of Savagem, Pir and Martian Dreams"
654.0,656.0, where it was still Ultima.
656.0,659.0," And you still had some of the same characters, but I could sort"
659.0,661.0, of set the tone for it.
661.0,664.0," And that's why Serpent Isle, which was the sequel to Ultima"
664.0,665.0, Seven.
665.0,666.0, That's why we created Serpent Isle.
666.0,668.0," I mean, that was a very consistent decision."
668.0,672.0," So I could play in his sandbox, but build my own castle there."
672.0,676.0," And really, I mean, there's no Disney continuity per se."
676.0,680.0," I mean, there's no timeline of Mickey Mouse's life that you could"
680.0,681.0, destroy.
681.0,682.0, You're just not the intention.
682.0,684.0, I might not pay attention.
684.0,687.0," Well, I mean, what was Disney's reaction to Kingdom Hearts"
687.0,689.0," and I mean, pretty sure they loved it."
689.0,690.0, Right.
690.0,691.0," I mean, it's very important for them."
691.0,692.0, No.
692.0,693.0, Yeah.
693.0,695.0," So, you know."
695.0,697.0," Um, Robert, you brought Sysam?"
697.0,700.0," No, I was just like opening my mouth and looking like expected."
700.0,701.0, Okay.
701.0,706.0," Um, so it has a really good impression of a fish."
706.0,708.0, You actually have cameras.
708.0,709.0, Yeah.
709.0,712.0, That would have been a great moment for Robert.
712.0,716.0," Both of Paul Warren, you contributed to a story called Three Wishes that's coming out"
716.0,718.0, the next GFW.
718.0,722.0," And that's basically where I propose this, both of our other"
722.0,727.0," non-propos this sort of game-genie that's able to make one thing,"
727.0,731.0," you know, one production problem vanished so that you can go ahead and then do something."
731.0,735.0," And in the course of that Paul, you sort of talked about how ideas, you said that"
735.0,739.0, ideas are cheap and that it's the execution that's important and expensive.
739.0,744.0," And in the course of that, you know, I mean, you were bringing that up talking about ways in which"
744.0,748.0, you would want some sort of machine that would allow you to test your crackpot ideas so that you don't.
748.0,750.0," My sleep, it probably is a typing box."
750.0,751.0, Right.
751.0,752.0, Exactly.
752.0,754.0, So you're matching this on to the poor programmers and stuff.
754.0,755.0, Right.
755.0,758.0," Maybe it's the wrong question to ask from them, but it did make me think,"
758.0,763.0, I want to know about both of your guys's oddest ideas that got shit
763.0,765.0, can because they weren't practical.
765.0,769.0, But that where your little darling's for however amount of time until someone finally
769.0,772.0," prevailed and said, look, Paul, Warren, this is not an order."
772.0,774.0, How much time do you have?
774.0,779.0," Well, you can pick the very, you know, what do you think it will be the most entertaining to hear?"
779.0,781.0, Wow.
781.0,784.0," If you got one off top of your head, I'm going to have some editing here."
784.0,788.0," One of the ones, one of the, we came up for an idea early on in the project."
788.0,792.0," Actually, it was such a bad idea that I should take credit for it because it wasn't a team effort."
792.0,794.0," It was my really, really bad idea."
794.0,798.0," And, you know, when I presented it to Ed and the stuff, they just kind of said, no,"
798.0,803.0," and it was for a combat role that was a kind of graveton, a gravitate guy."
803.0,807.0, And he would essentially be able to control the physics in the environment.
807.0,810.0," And I was thinking, yeah, this would be absolutely fantastic."
810.0,811.0, But it's just sandbox.
811.0,814.0," You know, it's kind of that thing where, you know, you get, you get games."
814.0,818.0," Or when you play as a kid, you'd be in a sandbox and you'd have like your plane and your Jeep and your truck."
818.0,820.0, And you'd play with each of those.
820.0,822.0," But as soon as you got bored, you're now just bored of it."
822.0,825.0," But when you grow a little bit older, and a friend was with you in the sandbox."
825.0,828.0," You'd establish some rules for, you know, I can move three places forward."
828.0,832.0," And now suddenly, it's 12 hours in the sandbox with exactly the same three vehicles,"
832.0,834.0, just because of the additional rules.
834.0,840.0," And so, what I hadn't really clicked in my head was that if you had some kind of gravitate combat role that had control over physics and stuff,"
840.0,844.0, all you've really done is given someone the ability to interact with the environment.
844.0,847.0, He's not there because he's actually a compelling combat role that it augments.
847.0,851.0," You know, the preferred playing styles of all of the other people that are on the team with you."
851.0,857.0, It's just something that I wrote because I thought it would be cool and it would make me look cool for coming up with the idea.
857.0,859.0, And the worst possible kinds of things to do.
859.0,864.0," And luckily for us, I mean, that's the kind of benefit we get for always working with mentors."
864.0,866.0," As you have Sony says, pull your an idiot."
866.0,868.0," And it's like, okay, I'm hitting delete now."
869.0,871.0, So you never sent that to them and they.
871.0,877.0," Yeah, now we, we talked through obviously we talked through tons and tons and tons of things because it would, would develop loads of ideas."
877.0,881.0," I mean, even from the very beginning, you know, the high concept went back and forth."
881.0,884.0, It'd be very hard to attribute that high concept to either company.
884.0,892.0, But Kevin never has bad ideas and I have tons and tons of bad ideas and that seems to be the way the balance works nicely.
892.0,896.0," You got to be throwing the bad ideas out there though, because that's how you get to the good ones right?"
896.0,901.0," And that was that was the point about ideas or cheap. I think the thing is really, and none of them are cheaper than mine."
901.0,906.0," So they're like, it's so easy to come up with really cool ideas and worse."
906.0,913.0," If you're really excited about it, it's so easy to get the whole company on board and behind you because, you know, you're just really passionate about this is going to absolutely rock."
913.0,917.0, And it just turns out to be something completely terrible that an absolute waste of time.
917.0,923.0," And you, you pull your stuff through all of that pain and trying to produce something, you know, and trying to meet your vision of what you should be working on."
923.0,927.0," Of course, it's wasted effort for them and to my allies is that."
927.0,931.0," My favorite thing is when people come to me, I'll answer your question and then I promise."
931.0,936.0," But you know, my favorite thing is when people come to me and say, I have a great idea."
936.0,942.0," I'll give you my idea and then you make the game and we'll split the profits, 50, 50."
942.0,945.0, Is that happening? Have some kids all the time.
945.0,946.0, It's like funny.
946.0,950.0," Dude, I have more ideas. I'm going to die before I make all the games I got ideas for."
950.0,954.0," And that doesn't even take into account the 100 people work for me. You know, I mean, come on."
954.0,955.0, Good at it.
955.0,962.0, And I did the hard work last night in the couch with my bang and I just served 50% of the profits.
962.0,966.0," I know it's going to take you a couple of years, but mom, I just met this guy."
966.0,967.0, I don't know him.
967.0,971.0," Mom, bro, I feel like if you're looking at this mom, don't listen."
971.0,973.0," No, but like bad ideas. I'll see."
973.0,976.0, I had one for a game called Roach Motel.
976.0,977.0, Where you were.
977.0,978.0, That was a bad idea.
978.0,979.0," Yeah, that was a bad idea."
979.0,983.0," You know, your Roach trying to survive in a really filthy house."
983.0,984.0, That was a good one.
984.0,986.0, It was a game like that.
986.0,988.0," Yeah, sure. Somebody made that game."
988.0,989.0, I'm sure.
989.0,994.0," I had another one. Here's one where that every, okay, two ideas that that at origin in 1990."
994.0,995.0, I have the documentation.
995.0,997.0, 1990. Everybody told me these were bad ideas.
997.0,1004.0," One was called real life where you're just, you know, doing little, little computer people, basically."
1004.0,1005.0," Oh, wait, that turned into the Sims."
1006.0,1007.0," Yeah, that was a bad idea."
1007.0,1008.0, I couldn't get anybody to order the game.
1008.0,1009.0, It'd be bad idea.
1009.0,1010.0, Not to make that one.
1010.0,1011.0," Yeah, really."
1011.0,1013.0," Well, let me confuse people."
1013.0,1014.0, I've got made.
1014.0,1016.0, It was a couple of 64 games.
1016.0,1019.0," And, oh, because you keep hearing this thing about Sims being the first game to do that."
1019.0,1021.0, I was playing that when I was 12.
1021.0,1022.0, What happened?
1022.0,1023.0," You know, because there was this game."
1023.0,1025.0," Yeah, people went to round the house."
1025.0,1027.0, They did everything that they do in 3D in this other game.
1027.0,1030.0, And I wanted to rip it off and we'll got to it first.
1030.0,1032.0, There was that one.
1032.0,1035.0," And then I said, hey, let's do a virtual Lego's game."
1035.0,1038.0," You know, and it's like, no, that's a bad idea."
1038.0,1040.0," You know, those were bad."
1040.0,1043.0," You know, those were probably, the one that actually,"
1043.0,1046.0," That's kind of the plot in the Microsoft's, right?"
1046.0,1049.0," Aren't they making their making a program that lets you use, like,"
1049.0,1051.0, virtual Lego's to build stuff?
1051.0,1052.0, Yeah.
1052.0,1053.0, Yeah.
1053.0,1055.0, And slip and flat food under the door.
1055.0,1056.0, Yeah.
1056.0,1058.0, Yeah.
1058.0,1059.0, Yeah.
1059.0,1063.0," The other one, I had an idea for a game called the,"
1063.0,1064.0, What was it?
1064.0,1066.0," Death and destruction, D&D is."
1066.0,1067.0," I was trying to, yeah."
1067.0,1072.0," The mad scientist in the way where I really wanted to do a cartoonies sort of, sort of game about,"
1072.0,1077.0," You're the evil guy, you know, trying to kill all the people investigating, you know,"
1077.0,1078.0, You're in a various activities.
1078.0,1084.0," You know, I had a, there was a mission that he said in the chopping mall where you were a serial killer."
1084.0,1086.0," And you know, I played this."
1086.0,1093.0," You know, I was a great idea, you know, you know, you're the, you have to send out your monsters to go destroy the villagers and everything."
1093.0,1096.0," It's kind of like, uh, evil genius, is that what that was called?"
1096.0,1098.0, What was that game that came out of Wallyg?
1098.0,1099.0, Evil genius.
1099.0,1100.0, So it was called?
1100.0,1106.0," There's Peter Mohn who did a game, you know, a years ago, uh, a dungeon keeper, you know,"
1106.0,1109.0," And it's like, I was going, they, and that was my idea."
1109.0,1112.0," You know, and again, I couldn't sell it to anybody, so."
1112.0,1113.0, Okay.
1113.0,1115.0," So basically, you're saying on this podcast, you thought of the Sims first."
1115.0,1116.0, Yep.
1116.0,1118.0, You thought of the Lego games first.
1118.0,1119.0, Yep.
1119.0,1121.0," And you thought of, uh, dungeon keeper first."
1121.0,1123.0, I still have the day and there's you want to tell me.
1123.0,1127.0," I have, I have the dated files on my concept docs."
1127.0,1129.0, I still have all of those this man.
1129.0,1131.0," I am, I am a, I'm a historian."
1131.0,1133.0, I'm keeping all you people in court.
1133.0,1135.0," No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
1135.0,1136.0," No, no."
1136.0,1138.0," Seriously, this gets back to what we're saying a minute ago."
1138.0,1140.0, It's like ideas really are the easy part.
1140.0,1142.0," That's why I've never, this is the first time my life."
1142.0,1144.0," I actually have to keep secrets, you know, because the bottom one is,"
1144.0,1146.0, the idea is the easy bit.
1146.0,1152.0," And if, if I say something and you go and steal that idea, and you can do a better job of it."
1152.0,1153.0, Right.
1153.0,1155.0," What, what did I, you know, what did I lose, right?"
1155.0,1159.0," I mean, what I'm going to do it differently and I hope better than you."
1159.0,1161.0," So the idea is, who cares about the idea?"
1161.0,1162.0, Right.
1162.0,1164.0," So far, say, say, you're saying, do it."
1164.0,1165.0, Keep it secret.
1165.0,1167.0, So you can get away of doing the West job.
1167.0,1171.0," You know, I wouldn't have put it that way, but now that you have, I'm going to steal that."
1172.0,1175.0," No, I mean, actually, I mean, we've, we've been through that where we've,"
1175.0,1182.0, we've gone to like a show like E3 and we've shown up on new game and we've had all these really cool ideas that we think are really innovative.
1182.0,1186.0," And somebody from a big publisher's wand around and we've thought, oh, we're talking to this big publisher."
1186.0,1188.0, We've shown them everything in three months later.
1188.0,1194.0," They announced exactly the same game with the same bullet points with the same, you know, almost the same vehicles mocked up and stuff like that."
1194.0,1196.0," And it's just, it's just one of those things, isn't it?"
1196.0,1200.0," I think that the, um, yeah, do you think that's natural sort of convergence?"
1200.0,1203.0, Or do you think there was actually a case of them lifting ideas?
1203.0,1207.0," I think the two, I think the two co-exist, I think there's definitely this notion that"
1207.0,1215.0," most of the people certainly in our area of game development multiplayer combat, a lot of us are having the same ideas and thinking about the same kind of evolution and stuff."
1215.0,1217.0, They're facing the same problem.
1217.0,1218.0, Right.
1218.0,1221.0," But then at the same time, I think there's kind of two sites to the industry as well."
1221.0,1225.0, And I really do believe strongly this idea of creating rather than competing.
1225.0,1228.0," You know, that you don't kind of climb the ladder and throw it down behind you."
1228.0,1233.0, You just try and look for something that's completely new and different and it hasn't been done before and you kind of do it your own way.
1233.0,1234.0," And you know, you don't care."
1234.0,1238.0," I'd much rather have, you know, twice the audience and the other half of the audience still buy the game."
1238.0,1244.0," They were buying already, then actually still the audience from another game because it has no, there's no benefit to me and it doesn't help me in any way at all."
1244.0,1250.0," And I think that on, if you kind of, if you try and live by that mantra of creating rather than competing,"
1250.0,1256.0," then you worry less about plagiarizing good ideas from other genres because you're ultimately not trying to,"
1256.0,1268.0," I don't mean plagiarizing in the criminal sense. I mean like, you know, like, like a, with a Warren adding role playing game elements to a first person shooter, which was an amazing move and it made such a big difference to the game."
1268.0,1274.0," And obviously that came from RPGs, but Warren was already an expert in RPGs from his time origin."
1274.0,1280.0," So you couldn't really say, well, you know, he kind of stole that from someone else's genre because he'd been there building the other genre before he shifts it over his shooters."
1280.0,1296.0," But there's, but there's nothing wrong with any of that stuff because you're just trying to create something really new, but there's definitely a big part of the industry, which is focused solely on what is the other publisher doing, how fast can we bring something out that competes with it and still is market share and stuff like that. And that's a shame really, but it's not going to change and it's pointless complaining about it."
1296.0,1302.0," Well, it, you know, the, the, to give you a specific example of how ideas are are almost irrelevant."
1303.0,1311.0," Back at that junction point, this is a while back now, but we just, we did, we took a month and just said, let's just throw out as many concepts as we can."
1311.0,1320.0," And we had, there was one idea, you know, I'll even say what it was, it was an archeology game. We just said, hey, what would an archeology game be like, you know, on the DS."
1320.0,1324.0," And, and a bunch of us wrote up proposals and they were all different."
1324.0,1327.0," They were all cool, but they were all different."
1327.0,1333.0," So, you know, the idea, it's just, it's the seed. It's not even a seed because the seed always grows into the same kind of plant."
1333.0,1337.0," It's just an idea is nothing, you know, it's all about execution."
1337.0,1340.0," But it's got to be worth going through exercises like that, right?"
1340.0,1346.0," Oh, it's awesome. You must have got something out of that archeology thing, right, that was something you could, you could build for us."
1346.0,1353.0," Sure, I mean, there were, there were different proposals where we could put ideas together, you know, that were, were complimentary ideas."
1353.0,1358.0," I discovered that one of my artists is a genius designer, who thought, who knew, you know?"
1358.0,1361.0," So, you learn a lot by doing that sort of stuff. And it's kind of fun too."
1361.0,1369.0," And I think this feeds into the other, into, into war and response to our same three wishes article about what you wish you could have."
1369.0,1373.0," If, if you know, just magically you could remove technological constraints from development."
1373.0,1382.0," And you talked about, you know, wishing that there was a standardized, easy accessible cheat platform to build games with so that you could take these ideas that you just,"
1382.0,1389.0," you know, have on the couch one night and see that turned into a game and, you know, quick."
1389.0,1398.0," Yeah, be able to actually get through some of these ideas and not spend three years on something, you know, and toss out all your other creative work."
1398.0,1401.0," Yeah, you know, I don't envy them."
1401.0,1414.0," Maybe you guys much, but I envy them the fact that they can go down, you know, basically to a corner store and read a camera and a, and a, a sound recorder and a bunch of lights and make a movie over the weekend, you know?"
1414.0,1419.0," And you can do it on a credit card, right? I mean, Robert Townsend and Robert, because, you know, those guys made movies on a credit card."
1419.0,1426.0," We can't do that because, you know, we're, we have to, you know, it's the old cliche. We have to build the camera every time we're making a game."
1426.0,1434.0," There is no engine out there that supports what I want to do in games. And, and as, as the hardware changes, the software has changed along with it."
1434.0,1439.0," So I'm constantly inventing a camera while I'm trying to make a movie. It's crazy, you know?"
1439.0,1450.0," It's, it's, if, if I could wave that magic wand, a genre free, no assumptions about workflow engine would be not the my last for sure."
1451.0,1466.0," Did you find the development as hard in that way as it was, you know, 20 years ago? Is it just a different set of 15 years ago, a different set of, of, challenges that are exactly the same, or, or is it a whole different ballgame."
1466.0,1470.0," Well, let me tell you, some, hey, hey, get me old days."
1471.0,1484.0," No, it, it's really easy to fall into the, the rose tinted glasses, you know, look at the past and think, oh, it was so much better than, you know, I think team of 10 guys and, you know, 10 guys, 10 guys was a big team."
1484.0,1491.0," And, you know, I made my first game, I made for $273,000 and I got bitched out by my boss because I only had a budget to $225, you know?"
1491.0,1501.0," We spent that, like, a week now, it's crazy, you know? And so it's, it's easy to look back and say it was more fun or it was easier, but it was just different, you know, back then we had to create everything."
1501.0,1509.0," It's like we didn't even have stuff like, you know, Gabriel or Unreal or, we didn't have anything to build on it was just all from scratch. So, you know, it's a different."
1509.0,1516.0," I was going to see if you, since this shows about YouTube, if you have any questions for each other."
1516.0,1518.0, Now it's turning out.
1518.0,1523.0, Not to be put on the spot.
1523.0,1530.0," I've got my easy out because I've already read everything there is to read about, we're in spank."
1530.0,1536.0," From what coming from the generational difference between your two, I mean, there could be some point."
1536.0,1539.0, I think not to look like a young punk.
1539.0,1545.0," Not to ruin the kind of exclusive on the magazine printing, the three design issues, the design wishes thing."
1545.0,1554.0," But it's, is the perfect example of the ideas thing because, in essence, what you asked, were in I fall were three ideas on, on games languages."
1554.0,1561.0," And although the execution is different, the end result on the first two, if I read into what were on said was correct, is exactly the same as the end result that I wanted."
1561.0,1569.0," Right, and we put, I mean, we paired those together in the story as well because I mean, there was convergence across the board, not with yours, but there were themes."
1569.0,1575.0, And part of the reason why we did that is to see which theme submerge on what's on everyone's mind over the course of the year.
1575.0,1578.0," And then that will help shape, you know, sort of follow-ups that we ask."
1578.0,1590.0," Yeah, and I think the thing, just to kind of put the thing to bed about the ideas, the cheap, I don't mean that in a kind of, you know, in a kind of nasty sense that ideas themselves have no value."
1590.0,1596.0," It's more, it's more kind of compared, it's that ideas, a cheap compared to execution, which is expensive."
1596.0,1608.0," I guess is the right way to say it. And so, yeah, it's that it is absolutely execution. That's the thing that I know that, you know, personally, I've got wrong a bunch of times in the past on little elements and little features and things that we've worked on."
1608.0,1613.0," And I think the thing is a company that we really, really striving to become much, much better at doing."
1613.0,1617.0," Well, I'm not sure there's, I'm going to talk for a second and I might get to a question for you."
1617.0,1622.0," I'm late. No, I'm not a good one. But one of the things that I've made it, then I didn't actually ask you a question."
1622.0,1633.0," I noticed that, that's pretty good. But you know, I often, you know, sit around with my, commercially old friends and we talk about, man, I'm glad I'm not getting started in the game business now."
1633.0,1646.0," Because it's that it's that roasted a glass thing. You know, there was, you know, the first GDC I went to, there were 300 people, 250 people, I think, you know, and now they put that many people in a room for one of the smaller talks, right?"
1646.0,1652.0," And, and it just seems like the dollars and sense have gone up so much. It's breaking in and doing cool stuff is tough for all the time."
1652.0,1660.0," I mean, do you have like, do you have a strategy for like moving beyond doing, you know, it, I piece stuff and building your studio."
1660.0,1667.0," So it's, I mean, for sustainability and stuff. I mean, I just spent three years and got, you know, frankly pretty frustrated at the state of the business these days."
1667.0,1671.0," Well, that would be the perfect time to plug my GDC space tomorrow."
1672.0,1684.0," And I didn't even know, wait, wait, no, no, no. I think I don't think I have any answers, but I think that that that I'm pretty good at seeing which things I've really messed up and writing those things down."
1684.0,1689.0, So it would be really nice to have a guiding set of principles that would work for everybody in every case.
1689.0,1702.0," But I do think that the same things that made people successful in any business in the past are still just as relevant, you know, it's loyalty to your and commitment to your customers and being really passionate about the thing that you're working on."
1702.0,1715.0," And, you know, like in, in our case for splash damage, we had a pretty straightforward goal, which was to shamelessly pursue critical acclaim and to make sure that our staff could pay rent."
1715.0,1729.0," And that was basically it. That was kind of our only two goals in life. And we thought, well, we don't really know anything about sales or how publishers sell games or anything about manufacturing or distribution or, you know, these other businesses and stuff."
1729.0,1741.0," And so, but the thing we do think we know about is, is what the community at large is going to like about the games that we make and there's no point making the same games as everybody else. So we find and cool to do something slightly different."
1742.0,1761.0," I think that the biggest thing, the one thing for us that's worked is having like a mentor and I think that there are enough really good big independent developers, many of them self funding still. The people like id software and Bethesda softworks and epic and Val software who have a multitude of small developers working for them."
1761.0,1779.0," Either on additional content for their own intellectual properties or creating new intellectual properties for those companies where you're not instantly in this relationship with a huge bullish publisher that's going to, you know, come at you and aggressively want to buy you and all this kind of stuff. And I think that makes a really big difference. I think that just it's huge."
1779.0,1789.0," On that note, an EA representative, if anyone can recall who specifically it was just as past week sort of announced the death of garage games, but the way that it was is announcement was written."
1789.0,1814.0," It was really as though he was saying announcing not the death of the garage studio in the Pachem programmer, but basically outfits like splash damage or junction points saying that you, this was him addressing the acquisition of bioware and pandemic and saying that this is natural, but this is also inevitable. So you guys are kind of, you're you're just outlining, you know, working for Valve and in need and all these."
1814.0,1822.0," And this is timely because there's this rumor around the net today that you know, Epic have been offered one billion by Microsoft or whatever."
1822.0,1830.0," And yeah, I think that the thing is, again, I guess when Warren got into gaming, it wasn't with an exit strategy."
1831.0,1840.0," And the same for me, I honestly someone told me what skewed stood for last week and I've been doing this now for seven years and I think it's stock keepers unit or something."
1840.0,1849.0, I've managed to survive six or seven years in the games industry without what knowing what any of those phrases mean or those terms or anything. I learned what player turn meant about a month ago.
1849.0,1858.0," And seriously this year my accountant explained to me how a balance sheet and a profit and lost statement works. And so you know, and I've been citing those for six years."
1858.0,1871.0, So there's obviously a lot of things that you really don't need to know anything about and I think over analysis of especially the business and strategy of the games industry can just be really bad for the sole of a new games company.
1871.0,1885.0, And it surprises me that it's someone from EA would say that because most of those folks have been around long enough to know that it's just it's a cyclical thing right I mean this industry has gone I've never been doing this for 25 years and I've seen I've seen the old all development should be internal.
1885.0,1900.0," Oh, all development should be external it's too expensive to have internal studios. Oh, we want to be internal to be just want to control things. Oh, we want to you know, it just goes back and forth and right now it that I mean your mileage may vary you know it's flash damage, but my my view of the where the industry is right now with rising costs for triple a title."
1900.0,1919.0," And you know new platforms which require new new cameras were build a new cameras again guys. You know trying to figure out how to I mean I'm like I try to figure out how to make a game in the in this day and age is crazy, but you know my my view is this is a better it is better to be an internal studio right now than the next one."
1919.0,1921.0, You know three years from now. Better it's different.
1921.0,1937.0," So for other people clearly it's different now. Yeah, I mean I dare to disagree with Lauren on this but for us and that's why I say I think a lot of this advice especially for you start up some stuff. It doesn't always suit the candidate, you know it depends on the genre you're working and I mean there's no mod making scene for console games."
1937.0,1944.0, So telling a group of mod makers that the best thing they could pursue for commercial success was to go and make a next generation 360 appears three game wouldn't be the best advice.
1944.0,1950.0, But perhaps making a game that they could publish on PSN or experts live arcade.
1950.0,1953.0, Arcade might be you know have potential for them.
1953.0,1962.0, In my case you know a couple of times over the years we've had you know approaches from publishers and things like that trying to buy splash damage and stuff.
1962.0,1971.0, And I think the quote that I gave them was that I was going to sit like sign on the pavement and wore my hands on the burning embers of the building before I sold them the coming out.
1971.0,1989.0, But I mean it just it's just that for us right now at this moment of time we really enjoy being independence but at the same time it's so scary financially all the time and it's always a huge risk and every transition you make from project to project you have to figure out what you know because it is as Warren said you know.
1989.0,1993.0, But burn rates that's a quote yet another horrible phrase.
1993.0,2009.0, I mean burn rate as a phrase is one that was created by the movie industry I believe or dot comm industry to talk about how fast companies were burning the money you were giving them as if whatever they were creating was a complete waste of time and yet we've adopted that as a perfectly valid expression for the finances of game development.
2009.0,2018.0, So it's terrible but that those periods it's so tough independent developers and you know it ultimately if you really do want staff to be stable and be able to pay rent or that kind of stuff.
2018.0,2024.0, Then perhaps you know being internal studio is a good idea for the long term financial stability the company.
2024.0,2038.0, But then you see what happens to people like Westwood who were a fantastic developer and and just don't exist anymore and you wonder you know what's going to happen with bio where and pandemic are they actually going to exist as brands three to five years from now do they just get swallowed up.
2038.0,2040.0, But it's not in two or is it the same way.
2040.0,2046.0, But then look at a bungee like bungee was able to get out right I mean to take it depends on on the company.
2046.0,2054.0, Right both the publisher and the developer too it probably has to do with the personalities and cultures of those companies themselves you know.
2054.0,2064.0, Like I quite liked one of a publisher recently said to me that the way that they work with developers is that they'd like to work with them for a year or two and think about chemically there's a good fit almost like the kind of honey
2064.0,2083.0," Not that they kind of fiance period and then they kind of get married and they'd like to acquire the studio a couple years down the line and it's a really I mean not once his name names, but it's a really nice publisher who who have a great reputation amongst developers and it makes you realize that you know they might not be the most financially successful but they're probably the ones with the best karma right now."
2083.0,2092.0, I guess we want to step in and see that the the the person from EA who said this is CEO John Ricky tell you Ricky Teefe.
2092.0,2105.0," Ricky Teefe. Ricky Teefe. Oh, what a scene. Oh CEO of EA. Pretty smart guy. He's a pretty smart guy. I don't know the times of anybody in the industry that does business or pay our own marketing."
2105.0,2116.0, Of course they do restructure all the time over there. It seems right every year there's something now it's the same studio and the whatever studio and then it's going to be a big.
2116.0,2129.0, Hello every year at some different. But the thing is they do they do the internal studios do put out such amazing games. I mean if you look at I mean we we were always huge fans of activism. We've really enjoyed working the past five or six years with them.
2129.0,2145.0, And last year I mean call of duty for and then guitar hero three in the space about two weeks is just such you know they're both such huge titles and and they are different and fun and you know graphically impressive and and you know there's
2145.0,2163.0, I don't know I don't know enough about the situation to know whether I agree or disagree with the notion of buying red octane and harmonics and the issue of that and everything but it looks like you know harmonics and now with the aid and they're working on rock band and that's a cool game as well. So it seems like that the whole internal studios can definitely make really really really good games.
2163.0,2168.0, But I mean conversely and this is the worst part of the industry I think if you look at metacritic.com
2168.0,2181.0, Two of the highest selling games for the whole of 2007 across all platforms were also the two lowest rated games across the entire industry and it's because they were backed by massive movie licenses
2181.0,2191.0, And it's just and that that's a bit frustrating to see because the signal it sends to other startups and independence and worse the kind of people that were coming to the industry just for the money
2191.0,2202.0, Which is what happened with the with the movie industry is that there is loads and loads and loads of money to be made just making crap that happens to match with a big movie release for a big marketing release
2202.0,2210.0, Or whatever else that's going on and you guys I mean you're not in long-worn and you're saying this but but of course both of you guys work with other people's existing properties
2210.0,2218.0, But the difference with these games is that they're I mean green lip from the very beginning with the idea of getting something out as fast as possible
2218.0,2222.0, Simply to coincide to be on the shelf at the time that the movie's out there.
2222.0,2228.0, Irrespective of the quality of the game and I don't think that necessarily means that that you know that a publisher doesn't want to do a really good job
2228.0,2231.0, But at the end of the day that deadline is completely immovable
2231.0,2236.0, We've had the luxury you know working with its software just doing when it's done stuff for six or seven years
2236.0,2243.0, So we actually got to write the milestone schedule and then we'd say what we're going to deliver on those dates and how much we should be paid for it and all this stuff
2243.0,2246.0, And it was a really really nice way to work
2246.0,2256.0, But you can't do that of course and a big movie wants to you know merchandise and and you know generate as much cash as it can so it's going to pursue every possible outlet
2256.0,2262.0, But I do believe that to the to the company you know the one that is trying to generate capital on the basis of the movie
2262.0,2271.0, They don't really see the computer game as any different from you know the McDonald's cup sponsors ship or anything else that generates revenue for them directly you know as a result of that intellectual property
2271.0,2276.0, Sometimes it seems like the the main thing to worry about is like the box it comes in
2276.0,2279.0, I mean that's a really spiffy box for that movie game
2279.0,2284.0, You know I bet they go through like you know 15 variations on it and they really
2284.0,2286.0, I assure you they do
2286.0,2293.0," Yeah, and they they really study like what they want to say on the back because you know that what's inside is like you know a Twinkie cream filling of shit"
2293.0,2295.0, Well you know
2296.0,2301.0," Yeah, they really want to get the outside you know you say that but you know when I take my curse"
2301.0,2306.0, It's really easy for me to get rante and you know my crumudge and head on and all like when I take it off
2306.0,2308.0, Which I would have you for like five seconds
2308.0,2311.0, You just call me polyanifer minute
2311.0,2319.0, One of the cool things about the the game business right now is how how much variety there is. I mean it seems like for the first time in a very long time
2319.0,2326.0, There's room for you know the the shit in a box license right and it's okay for me to say that right of course awesome
2326.0,2329.0," Okay, mom I didn't say and"
2329.0,2336.26, There's room for you know boutique MMOs and there's room for the big you know Blizzard style extra
2336.26,2346.0, A Ganson and there's room for mods and there's room for you know seven kids from Digi Pen to make portal and there's room for there's room for just about everything right now
2346.0,2347.0," It's crazy, you know"
2348.0,2356.0, It really seems to me like the audience for games compared to the audience for movies is pretty amazingly informed about what you know
2356.0,2362.0, What is you know worth playing and what isn't I mean games that that make it tend to be pretty good
2362.0,2368.0, I mean you can disagree about whether or not you really love Call of Duty for whatever
2368.0,2372.0," You know, I'm not the biggest fan of that game, but I can see that it's a worthwhile thing people"
2372.0,2378.0, You know it's end to buy pretty good games compared to you know there are a lot of crap movies that make a lot of money
2378.0,2383.0, You know if you look at if you look at the best-selling games in any given year they tend to be the the highest rate
2383.0,2387.0, They quality really does seem to make a difference in the game business which is kind of cool
2387.0,2388.0, Oh
2388.0,2395.0, On the note of all that variety when to ask if there are any games that either you really want to play but that haven't been made
2395.0,2402.0," It's kind of assuming that they're that they are good ideas, but just that because of either the market or whatever whatever reason"
2402.0,2405.0, I want to play that archaeology game that you know what you're now
2405.0,2406.0, Anyone
2406.0,2407.0, Oh
2407.0,2413.0, I guess I have the luxury of being in the position of just starting on the game that I really wanted to play that hasn't been made yet
2413.0,2416.0," Okay, but I'm not going to talk about it at all. Unfortunately"
2416.0,2421.0, But I mean that's that's the only reason to be a game designer is that you get to make that decision
2421.0,2423.0, I'll be right about that
2423.0,2428.0," Yeah, you know the bit where I said I'm not going to talk about it at all right. That's the counts that still counts"
2428.0,2429.0, I'm not gonna talk about it
2429.0,2433.0, Where in that we're in the process of negotiating stuff with publishers right now and it would be wrong of me to you
2433.0,2441.0, So you know whatever it is that they will plan on one today. I have to say you know the legitimate answer to your question is I would really love to play a small group
2441.0,2450.0, Multiplayer game with a really kick ass story. You know I would love something that that could recreate the the old d and d
2450.0,2452.72, the old D&D experiences to have with my gaming group.
2452.72,2454.64," And I don't get that charge out of,"
2454.64,2457.44," well, any of the multiplayer games that are out there"
2457.44,2459.28, now because they all tend to be either competitive
2459.28,2463.92," or, you know, focused on basically killing everything"
2463.92,2464.72," the moves, right?"
2464.72,2467.12, And I don't get that charge out of MMOs
2467.12,2469.28," because I really don't want to hang out with 10,000"
2469.28,2470.28, of my close personal friends.
2470.28,2473.04, I want to find the six guys and girls
2473.04,2474.48, that I like to hang out with.
2474.48,2477.36," The guys dressed as go, then yeah, well, there is that."
2477.36,2480.08, But I want to avoid all those people.
2480.08,2482.36, I want to become kids in there.
2482.36,2484.6400000000003," You know, if someone could really just nail"
2484.6400000000003,2487.2000000000003," the multiplayer storytelling problem,"
2487.2000000000003,2488.1200000000003, might be a happy guy.
2488.1200000000003,2490.2000000000003, And that seems like there's a lot of people trying
2490.2000000000003,2491.8, to do that or they've been trying to do that.
2491.8,2492.8," Yeah, nobody's done it."
2492.8,2494.1200000000003," Yeah, nobody's got it right."
2494.1200000000003,2495.8, That's why that's that's a little gym manager.
2495.8,2498.4, But the other side of the answer is what Paul just said.
2498.4,2501.1600000000003," It's like, you know, I have been lucky enough"
2501.1600000000003,2506.1600000000003, in my life that I've actually never been a signed a project.
2506.16,2508.3999999999996, I have always picked my projects.
2508.3999999999996,2510.72, And so every project I'm working on is the one I really
2510.72,2512.08, want to be working on.
2512.08,2515.3199999999997," And right now it's like, I don't want to put a percentage"
2515.3199999999997,2515.52, on it.
2515.52,2519.96," A large part of the reason why I joined Disney was because,"
2519.96,2522.3199999999997," you know, when this project shifts,"
2522.3199999999997,2526.3999999999996," the one of the projects we're talking about with these guys,"
2526.3999999999996,2529.96," it's like I feel like you know, my work will be done."
2529.96,2532.16," I mean, it's the dream project for me."
2532.16,2534.92," And even if everybody in the world hates it, I don't care."
2534.92,2537.0, And that's the reason to do stuff.
2537.0,2539.92," As far as I'm concerned, it's not so people's hate it."
2539.92,2542.08, That sort of came out.
2542.08,2543.08, I hope they love it.
2543.08,2545.52," But even if they do, for a creative standpoint,"
2545.52,2548.0," it's going to be, you know, this is a project I really need to do."
2548.0,2549.84," Yeah, let's be sure to miss quote him in the magazine."
2549.84,2551.96," Oh, I hope people hate my game."
2551.96,2556.96," Well, it's part of the wide variety of games that are out there."
2556.96,2559.56, There's at least theoretically games for your parents.
2559.56,2562.12, And I know that neither of your parents play games.
2562.12,2563.56, Mind us.
2563.56,2563.92, Really?
2563.92,2566.6800000000003," Yeah, my dad's, he'll hate me for saying this,"
2566.6800000000003,2568.0, but almost 70.
2568.0,2570.52, And he's a huge red alert and command and concafan
2570.52,2571.84," on the PC to the,"
2571.84,2573.4, properly hard course coming out.
2573.4,2577.7200000000003, And can be seven computer enemies on the highest setting
2577.7200000000003,2578.64, in the game as well.
2578.64,2579.16, Wow.
2579.16,2580.0, Wow.
2580.0,2581.6800000000003, Do you ever challenge him?
2581.6800000000003,2584.0," No, he'd absolutely kick my ass."
2584.0,2585.0, But let him do it.
2585.0,2586.0, Great.
2586.0,2589.84," Sorry, Jolly, I'm doing this video at the moment."
2589.84,2591.24, He's kind of sat behind me.
2591.24,2593.6," I guess is my PR handler, but I've got headphones on,"
2593.6,2595.2, which is cool because I can talk about anything.
2595.2,2596.04, I like it.
2596.04,2597.8," I can't hear everyone say, don't say that."
2597.8,2600.8, But we used to play a lot of red alert
2600.8,2602.48, and command and concafan stuff in the studio
2602.48,2605.44," when we first started out, which was our horrible place to be"
2605.44,2607.52, because we were like four floors above a pub with no air
2607.52,2609.4, conditioning and it was like 42 degrees.
2609.4,2612.12," What's that like, 80 something in the office?"
2612.12,2614.44," You know, it's splash challenge."
2614.44,2617.0, But we used to play a lot of red alert and command and conca.
2617.0,2621.2400000000002, And we got into such massive foul arguments about stuff
2621.2400000000002,2624.2400000000002, and especially Richard because he would find the most
2624.2400000000002,2628.2400000000002, devious tactic like there's this guy who could plant C4
2628.2400000000002,2630.44," and he'd build one of them, build a helicopter,"
2630.44,2632.44, put him in the helicopter or whatever vehicle
2632.44,2634.6, could get to my base as fast as possible.
2634.6,2636.12, And before I had the little dogs that could
2636.12,2637.84, defend the guys that stupid spy
2637.84,2639.44, and then he'd turn up the volume on his speakers.
2639.44,2643.7200000000003," So I can hear his spy guy, okay, sir, I will."
2643.72,2645.08," I'm on my shoulders, I'm blood."
2645.08,2645.9199999999996," I'm okay, sir."
2645.9199999999996,2649.48," And I'd look at him, he'd have such a big evil smirk on his face."
2649.48,2652.9599999999996," And I was thinking, if I can't beat our director"
2652.9599999999996,2655.3599999999997, then I'm not playing my dad.
2655.3599999999997,2657.64, What did you pitch your dad against our director?
2657.64,2661.68," That's right, I love to say he would absolutely"
2661.68,2662.68, look at the ringer.
2662.68,2663.9599999999996, My mom will touch.
2663.9599999999996,2667.3599999999997, She can barely touch a computer email as complicated
2667.3599999999997,2668.04, she's gonna get.
2668.04,2671.64, But I actually play guitar hero and now rock band
2671.64,2673.4399999999996," with my mother-in-law and my father-in-law,"
2673.44,2675.04, which is freaky.
2675.04,2678.2400000000002," I said, I know the guys at her monics."
2678.2400000000002,2682.2400000000002," And I sent them pictures of my 70-year-old mother-in-law playing,"
2682.2400000000002,2683.52," you know, rock and out."
2683.52,2684.96, Is that slightly vindicated though?
2684.96,2686.52," I mean, to either, for either of you,"
2686.52,2688.56, to at least have that one connection
2688.56,2691.64, where that they're at least remotely connecting to one.
2691.64,2694.04, There's a weird anecdote at Christmas.
2694.04,2696.0," We'd been out, not this Christmas,"
2696.0,2698.16, the Christmas just beforehand.
2698.16,2700.2400000000002, My fiance and I arrived back at the house
2700.2400000000002,2702.0, and Richard Mayart just parents were
2702.0,2703.96, over visiting mine at the house.
2703.96,2706.12, And I came into the house and they had the weak controller
2706.12,2708.32, and Richard had just bought a Richard was living at the time
2708.32,2710.12, and he just bought a Wii for the house.
2710.12,2711.64, And they're stood.
2711.64,2713.44, So you've got the plasma TV up on the wall
2713.44,2714.76, in the lounge and then there's a big hallway
2714.76,2716.4, and then there's another dining room.
2716.4,2718.28," And they're at the other end of the dining room,"
2718.28,2719.6, waving the weak controller
2719.6,2721.68, because they've decided if they stand further away
2721.68,2724.12," from the plasma, like in real bowling."
2724.12,2725.24, They'll be better at it.
2725.24,2727.24, LAUGHTER
2727.24,2730.48," Whoever it is, then they'll come up with Wii bowling"
2730.48,2733.0, like deserves some piece prize or something.
2733.0,2735.76," I mean, that prevented so many arguments"
2735.76,2737.0, that thanksgiving.
2737.0,2738.0, Oh yeah.
2738.0,2740.0, Paul takes me to the gym come up and turn on the Wii.
2740.0,2740.84, Yeah.
2740.84,2742.28," And those things, what is this all about?"
2742.28,2745.12," With my fiance, Lanny, when I met her,"
2745.12,2747.88, she was an absolute out and out empty gamer
2747.88,2749.36, in every way that you could think of.
2749.36,2752.92, Just thought that gamers were sad and dirty and geeky
2752.92,2755.28, and wasn't her kind of thing and all this stuff.
2755.28,2757.76," And now, like two, three times a week"
2757.76,2758.76, I'll come to the house and she'll be
2758.76,2760.8," standing in front of the, in front of the plasma"
2760.8,2762.32, with a guitar Harry three controller.
2762.32,2764.2000000000003, Founcing around the room and everything.
2764.2000000000003,2766.2000000000003," Say, well, it's not a real game."
2766.2000000000003,2768.0," You know, it's not a real game."
2768.0,2769.8," Yeah, okay."
2769.8,2770.8, Nice.
2770.8,2773.36, So I don't have that problem in my wife's name.
2773.36,2776.0400000000004, I met her in a comic shop and we ended up working.
2776.0400000000004,2778.0, It's Steve Jackson Games together.
2778.0,2781.2400000000002," She is, I guarantee she is playing World of Warcraft"
2781.2400000000002,2782.48, at this very moment.
2782.48,2783.32, Wow.
2783.32,2785.8, She might be playing Rock Band out on a rock band
2785.8,2786.6400000000003, or World of Warcraft.
2786.6400000000003,2788.1600000000003, I was at the Dreamhouse.
2788.16,2789.16, Right.
2789.16,2790.16, Now we know.
2790.16,2791.16, Zero.
2791.16,2792.16, I've got a question for you.
2792.16,2795.16, With Steve Jackson was not around the same time they were doing the books.
2795.16,2796.16," Well, okay."
2796.16,2799.16," See, it's a different Steve Jackson."
2799.16,2800.16," Yeah, there are three."
2800.16,2802.16," Well, I don't know how many there are now."
2802.16,2804.16," But there in, when was that?"
2804.16,2808.16," 83, I got my job at Steve Jackson Games and there were three different Steve"
2808.16,2809.16, Jack.
2809.16,2810.16, So there's games workshop.
2810.16,2812.16, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone and the UK.
2812.16,2814.16, That's the game's workshop.
2814.16,2815.16," And he's not, he's not the same owner."
2815.16,2816.16, There was the company over here.
2816.16,2817.16," No, Steve Jackson Games and all."
2817.16,2818.16, There's no Jackson Games and Austin Texas.
2818.16,2819.16, There's a couple of different areas.
2819.16,2820.16, There's another one in Arizona.
2820.16,2821.16, You mean the game?
2821.16,2822.16," Yeah, I worked with the groups."
2822.16,2823.16, There you go.
2823.16,2824.16, Wow.
2824.16,2825.16, That's a way to be remembered.
2825.16,2826.16, That's my legacy.
2826.16,2830.16, That's a shame because I had a cool anecdote about majoring my pre-conj�s era.
2830.16,2833.16, Stealing Steve Jackson books out of the store.
2833.16,2835.16, But I won't tell you that story now.
2835.16,2837.16," Well, that's Steve Jackson's a good guy."
2837.16,2838.16, I was telling you.
2838.16,2839.16, That's a criminality.
2839.16,2840.16, You're always welcome.
2840.16,2841.16," Yeah, we've told our own."
2841.16,2843.16," Yeah, we've had a whole bunch of my own."
2843.16,2844.16, I don't have.
2844.16,2848.16," Yeah, if you do want to tell us about how you figured this books."
2848.16,2854.16," So Sean, you're underlying question about the parents before it seemed to me."
2854.16,2860.16, You were kind of getting our honor or maybe implying the thing that we understand amongst ourselves.
2860.16,2871.16," But I wonder if you guys feel it to the sort of like legitimate, you know, whether a gaming career is a legitimate one say in the eyes of your own folks say or your relatives."
2871.16,2876.16," And, you know, I wonder if now it must be easier for you to be able to say why work for Disney."
2876.16,2880.16, But certainly both of you have had great success.
2880.16,2884.16, And I wonder if that success is actually acknowledged by your family.
2884.16,2886.16, So if they don't even understand what they do.
2886.16,2894.16," And it isn't like, is it more awkward or is it like actually a good thing when it's your nephew's and stuff that are the ones that understand and appreciate it and that come to you?"
2894.16,2897.16," Yeah, listen, I dropped out of a PhD programming."
2897.16,2903.16," I did my orals. I was done. I said, I write my dissertation and I dropped out."
2903.16,2906.16, And my mom is still crying.
2906.16,2909.16," I mean, she stopped crying recently, you know, like a year ago."
2909.16,2912.16, But so I was the black sheep of my family.
2912.16,2920.16," You know, it's like there's there's the doctor there's the lawyer there's the vice president of the bank, you know, and there's Warren making video games."
2920.16,2921.16," It's like, oh, it was hard."
2921.16,2923.16," Even until recently, you know what it changed?"
2923.16,2925.16, I can tell you the exact moment it changed.
2926.16,2931.16," Whenever we shipped the ultimate underworld, I can't remember the 991 something like that."
2931.16,2940.16," And my banker cousin went into a software store and said, I need a gift for a 13 year old boy."
2940.16,2945.16, What should I buy? And the guy brought out a game that had mine on the back of the box.
2945.16,2949.16," And half an hour later, the spectrophone lines were burning up."
2950.16,2954.16," And at that, I got a call from the lawyer guy saying, you want to represent me."
2954.16,2957.16," I got a call from my cousin, the bank or saying, can I be your financial advice?"
2957.16,2964.16, It was really pretty funny. That was the moment when I went for being the black sheep to the family celebrity.
2964.16,2965.16, Pretty funny.
2965.16,2966.16, And it's just now.
2966.16,2968.16," I mean, games are hot, right?"
2968.16,2970.16, Everybody knows about them.
2970.16,2972.16, They're legitimate.
2972.16,2977.16," You know, at least mainstream in terms of what people think about them, even if they're not in terms of sales and stuff."
2978.16,2980.16," No, it's it's all good now."
2980.16,2989.16," Because the families are so like nonchalant and detached from it, you ever find it weird when you do have an encounter that that's like celebrity or pseudo celebrity or something."
2989.16,2991.16, Or are you going to a game store or something?
2991.16,2993.16, That happened to me the other day.
2993.16,3002.16," I was here on on what is it on Powell Street on the in the in the e-B and and I'm buying a game and a guy guy came under and said, you're a war inspector."
3002.16,3004.16," And he started like, what do you buy?"
3005.16,3008.16," You know, it's like a phone that goes flying in porn or something."
3008.16,3011.16," You know, I don't want you to see that I'm buying that."
3011.16,3013.16, So what about the real thing though?
3013.16,3015.16, Did you talk to him or did you just go to awkward?
3015.16,3017.16," No, I mean, it's weird."
3017.16,3018.16, But it's fun.
3018.16,3020.16, It's nice that people recognize your work and stuff.
3020.16,3021.16, It's weird.
3021.16,3023.16," They recognize you, you know, but whatever."
3023.16,3024.16, It's cool.
3024.16,3025.16, How about you Paul?
3025.16,3033.16," I think that, you know, in multiplayer gaming, the community support has been ahead of most of the rest of the industry for such a long period that all the most of them."
3033.16,3045.16, All the multiplayer combat developers have been chatting to all their fans for ages and then we have these huge huge lamb parties where six or seven thousand people turn up and these things are running monthly all across Europe and all across the states.
3045.16,3052.16," So we kind of had that pseudo rock star feeling back as mod makers, you know, in their days."
3052.16,3059.16, But it's so easy to be to kind of become completely up yourself and you see it happening to other people.
3059.16,3063.16," So, you know, we just try not to really fall into that at all."
3063.16,3073.16," You know, just like not to, you know, if somebody wants an autograph and stuff like that, we've done, I mean, obviously sign, you know, hundreds of posters and game box companies and stuff like that."
3073.16,3077.16, But just I think it's really important for for game developers just to remember.
3077.16,3085.16," I mean, in our case you see, we were in such big fans of Ed that for us kind of being in a bar with Ed at that first, quite come back in 2000 was absolutely amazing."
3085.16,3102.16," Oh my god, we're in a bar with Ed and like getting loads of gossip on them and all this kind of stuff and and I think that that feeling is is really, really cool and I think I probably don't quite appreciate, you know, how many people now know me because you do get a lot of people shaking your hand and saying hello and all that kind of stuff."
3102.16,3109.16," But I mean, I think I guess I'm probably kind of the opposite of of Warren in that at 15, I got expelled from school."
3109.16,3123.16," So as far as my mum was concerned, like the only way is up, like if I turn out to be like a dustbin collector then that's a good thing because you know it's better than the whatever else my future held for Neil and Steve Jackson."
3123.16,3132.16," You know what, what the reason I was going to prove that is quite funny because I think the moment it kind of hit me that I was in the games industry and smashed, I mean, it was a success and everything."
3132.16,3138.16," I was flying business class, I think for the first time on British airways or something a few years back."
3138.16,3147.16, I think it was one of the early E3s that I went to and and in Livingstone was was was was about to sleep next to it and Livingstone which is a fairly odd.
3147.16,3149.16," Oh, I do."
3149.16,3155.16," And I said and I said to me, I said to me, hey, you're in Livingstone, you said, yeah, that's me or whatever and we shook hands."
3155.16,3164.16, I told him where I was from and he'd heard of splash damage not because he'd actually heard of me but because Richard my art director and him had been on a panel for a quiz show and kick jazz sounds.
3164.16,3173.16," Anyway, that's a whole separate thing and I said to him, I'm a really big fan of your work and he said, oh, thank you very much for the role, he's like being a bit kind of a bit nasty back to me."
3173.16,3176.16," And I was thinking, no, I stole the wall."
3177.16,3190.16," But yeah, I think there is you definitely that transition that happens in the games industry where you realize that you know where you find yourself typing your own name into Google and you're like, oh my god, I've never been doing that again."
3190.16,3198.16, And I closed the browser and there's no point because in Google apps now you can actually submit to this thing and it sends you links about yourself all day.
3198.16,3199.16, Oh my god.
3199.16,3201.16, I have I have for it.
3201.16,3202.16, I'm joking by the way.
3202.16,3203.16, That's true.
3203.16,3205.16, I have friends who do that.
3205.16,3207.16, It's like they never I never read any press.
3207.16,3209.16," I mean, I just I can't do it."
3209.16,3213.16, The bottom line is if you if you start believing the good stuff you have to start believing the bad stuff too.
3213.16,3219.16, So I just talk and I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't even else from my friends you say.
3219.16,3224.16," Yeah, I just Google doesn't me an automatic message that you did another interview you know."
3224.16,3226.16, I was like I just I can't deal with that.
3226.16,3236.16," How do you deal with I with hate mail from those fans, especially you know for you on the multiplayer side since every little tweak you do when a patch is going to just like produce right."
3236.16,3239.16, We had you know and then in addition to that.
3239.16,3244.16, Do you do communicate with them on message board and stuff like those to either you do ever get an e-battle.
3244.16,3251.16," I think back in like 2000 when we were doing the mode stuff, we used to run that that website key three F dot com from mode."
3251.16,3257.16," And we had really really active forums and we'd been we'd been really lucky, but I think probably lucky beyond."
3257.16,3265.16," You know, it was just the right mod at the right time for the right community and the right game and everything and happened to become really popular and really successful."
3265.16,3271.16," And the forums went completely mad there were 125,000 hits a week I think to the forums at that point."
3271.16,3278.16," And it was because I think you know I only sounds like I'm being overly humble, but it was because there wasn't a lot else would be able to play at the time."
3279.16,3289.16, But we would get the most insane rants and the most personally offensive things you know that people could possibly say about you on the internet.
3289.16,3297.16, But I mean from people for a game that we're giving away for free for nothing to them direct to that matter.
3297.16,3305.16, And I remember when we did the mod we had a really good friend of ours who used to live out in Dallas he was an old guy probably in his 50s or 60s.
3305.16,3314.16, And he was a really really big fan of our game and when we went out to Dallas a quick and we'd hang out with him and he'd buy us a few beers and stuff to say thanks for the mod and what have you.
3314.16,3330.16, And well he died so we dedicated one of the releases for the mod to this player he we were we were you know such big fans of about two years later I think this is how weird the press can get.
3330.16,3343.16, Daring Gladstone who you guys know of course he came to our studio a couple years ago and while he was interviewing me snuck to my desk got my car keys out of the car ran outside got in the car and got a photo of him pretending to steal my car.
3343.16,3346.16, Which I thought was really really funny.
3346.16,3362.16, But someone put a photo up on the internet of me and front the splash to me sign on the same on the same blog post and part of my jeans were like folded over you know so it just created a bit of a shadow and so on put her her splashed a splashed on his pool wedged pisses himself on camera or something like this.
3362.16,3367.16, So really offensive post and then down below like 12 post down is a reply from some guy who says.
3367.16,3373.16, Who gives a crap about splash to his they sold out what he dedicate your next game to your dead friends or something.
3373.16,3378.16," Okay, this is like got so far. I'm not reading any of it anymore or it's completely irrelevant."
3378.16,3386.16," Yeah, so we stick to our forums we have forums on splashdowns.com and community dot enemy territory dot com. Oops plug and."
3387.16,3393.16, But we just hang out there and our own little corner of the the kind of thing you've got your finger on the band button and the intro web.
3393.16,3410.16," Yeah, I just again I don't read that stuff. I can't you know I my wife reads it religiously and gets in sense about the things people are saying about me, but if I knew it, I'd either get like totally depressed or I'd get a swelled head and neither one is good for me. So she keeps up on on the."
3411.16,3417.16," Yeah, you ever have to tell her to stop when she starts to share with you. Yeah, I do. I just I just don't want to hear it."
3417.16,3419.16, That she posted anonymously defending you.
3419.16,3422.16, Is there so I do not know and I do not want to know.
3422.16,3425.16," You know, I have a blog. I started you've caused a four now."
3425.16,3428.16, I know. I was wondering what was like no way.
3428.16,3431.16," My vector is so sexy and I was like, who is this person?"
3434.16,3436.16, That doesn't sound like my wife.
3437.16,3448.16," No, but I've got a blog and I go on there and I interact with those guys not not as often as I'd like as a boy. I could totally get sucked into that and spend the rest of my life blogging and responding to, you know, comments and stuff."
3448.16,3451.16, Is the other developers that that blog on the I mean that respond to you as well?
3451.16,3452.16, There.
3452.16,3456.16," Some yeah, there's it's a lot of fans stuff and some some developers."
3456.16,3461.16, Do you think that developers talk with one another enough? I mean outside of their own studios.
3461.16,3465.16," Oh, yeah. I mean, there are there are all sorts of super secret, you know, secret masters of gaming."
3466.16,3471.16," Mailing lists that I probably shouldn't even have said that, but ah, there's a crack in it."
3471.16,3477.16," There is there is a lot there is, there's a lot more communication than there's enough communication."
3477.16,3486.16, Let's just say to keep things keep people honest and make sure that the game community is is well served with better and better games.
3486.16,3489.16," Paul, are you on the secret list of ones or?"
3489.16,3494.16," Yeah, I'm on a couple of them. I didn't. If I'm on the one I'm on one the Warren was on a few years ago. I think."
3494.16,3499.7," But yeah, there's a there's some good places for hanging out where you know publishers are banned"
3501.7,3507.16, We've got to go on to discover it's all it's all just kind of independent game developers chatting to each other openly with no fear of
3507.16,3514.08, So being each other or anything like that and you'd be surprised how many you know disputes are resolved in these places without having to worry about
3514.08,3516.08, I'd love to see that
3516.08,3518.08, We need to spy years
3518.48,3520.48, Collect them see what comes out of them
3521.68,3523.68, Actually one of them which I'm not gonna name
3524.3199999999997,3528.0, The the intention is some day to make all of the posts public
3528.0,3535.7599999999998, There's people it's it's anonymous until you know there things can't be damaging anymore and then the plan is actually to release all that stuff like a Warren commission
3535.7599999999998,3539.2799999999997," Sort of yeah, yeah, I mean that's that'll be really cool when it happened"
3539.2799999999997,3541.2799999999997, If it ever gets to lose but then I think
3543.2799999999997,3546.96, I think the strategy for those sites and things because they exist in loads of other industries
3546.96,3551.92, I know that there's one just for game development stuff that owners are allowed to join
3551.92,3557.44, It's a huge forum and they can basically write what they like about a game development company in an as the owner
3557.44,3561.36, I can't go there and defend myself or other developers can't develop as calm
3561.84,3567.92, There's a public relations one where just PR stuff allowed to go there and talk to the witches are really scary
3567.92,3570.96, I didn't know that there's a marketing one as well
3570.96,3576.36," So yeah, they're at there are tons of these things and I imagine it's not just the games of the streets probably searching for films people"
3576.36,3582.84," Again, everything has no such thing though. Yeah, well the key to the key to the presence the key to having any invite Jeff"
3583.32,3588.44," The key to having any kind of talk about you. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna say it now. No, I'm sorry"
3588.44,3592.2000000000003, I think the key to kind of presence on those things is just to
3593.4,3596.52, Somebody said to me I think a couple years ago never write anything down
3596.76,3602.2400000000002, You know like if I I see cure messenger email or anything that you wouldn't want to appear on a newspaper
3602.56,3606.08, Kind of from page and I just that's just the way I treat that things now
3606.08,3609.04, I learned that lesson the hard way. I mean when I was at ion storm
3609.04,3616.4399999999996," I don't know if you guys remember the Dallas observer. Oh, yeah, actually got a got hold of of the ion storm male server and and they"
3616.4399999999996,3621.52, They posted email messages. I mean I felt so violated when that story came out
3621.52,3625.8399999999997," Holy cow, but what was the gist of their story like what we got emails?"
3626.4,3633.44," No, I was a pretty crazy place. I mean and and that's been well chronicle delts where we don't need to go into a"
3634.0,3639.52, But but part of the the the the expose of how crazy on storm was
3640.2400000000002,3644.8, Was a result of you know employees leaving and sort of sharing
3645.44,3650.96, emails from the owners to other owners and from employees to other people at other companies
3650.96,3652.96, I mean it was a pretty spooky thing
3653.68,3661.08," Yeah, seeing you know like contract negotiation emails in a newspaper it was it was bad"
3661.08,3665.6," It was bad so that's kind of grim you know, but you know what I miss this is"
3666.8,3671.48, How's how's my handle looking back at? She looks okay. Okay. Okay. Good. He's my one
3671.48,3674.84, What you guys remember? She just furiously tapping under pda
3674.84,3676.84, Oh boy
3676.84,3680.8, This is quite good. It's radio Warren's just being a premature daughter. There's no handling
3684.2400000000002,3685.56," Oh, darn the secret"
3687.56,3691.78," You know you're gonna get you remember a bitch x oh yeah, you know there was oh, yeah"
3691.78,3694.38, There were there for a while there were all these stuff like fat
3695.38,3698.6400000000003," Yeah, it was the spot the same time. Yeah, it was about the same time. Yeah, it was about the same time"
3698.6400000000003,3704.44, fat babies and bitch x and I can't remember where I was working then if it was looking on sort of origin or I don't know where it was
3704.44,3708.82, But you know the first thing we everybody in the game business used to do with every day
3708.82,3710.88, You get in the office. It's like you didn't read email
3710.88,3719.76, You just went online and check bitch x and fat babies and and I remember one day and email went around saying ignore everything on fat
3719.76,3725.16, They ignore everything here. It's not true. It's you know and and it's like I was sitting in a thinking wait
3725.8,3727.8, Every single thing I know about
3727.8,3732.1000000000004, About that I read on fat babies and bitch x is completely accurate
3732.1000000000004,3736.0800000000004, Why would I assume that that this thing you're talking about isn't true to it's like
3736.0800000000004,3738.88, I don't know where they got their information from but what was that?
3738.88,3740.88, What's that? What was on there?
3740.88,3742.1600000000003, I can't
3742.1600000000003,3743.1600000000003, I don't honestly I don't know
3743.1600000000003,3748.04, I would I would tell you if I remembered but like it must have been a really cool
3748.7200000000003,3754.1600000000003, On the without plugging something specific there are some really cool tools on the internet for going back and looking at website post
3754.16,3759.96," Oh, sure years and years and years ago. Yeah, and if you just like Google, you know web archives"
3759.96,3764.08," So whatever that arc of yeah, there's a few of those and that absolutely amazing"
3764.08,3767.6, Just kind of go back and read websites like 97 90
3767.6,3773.24," I used net is great to go back to yeah, there's tons of pulse I regret making that's crazy"
3773.24,3778.6, It's all this lawsuit material and it's all completely accurate and it's all just out there for anybody who wants to read it
3778.6,3781.16, I was wonder if everything eventually
3781.16,3787.0, No matter how anonymous you think you're being on the internet will one day actually come to be tied to your name
3787.52,3792.44, You know that like some day people just get it all sorted out of a matrix like you know wait
3792.44,3794.6, I think I just got the plot for day sx3 a way
3794.6,3799.8399999999997," Not working on the x3, right? I think there there must be a lot of jackasses online who would really regret"
3799.8399999999997,3801.8399999999997, Jackasses on the god
3801.8399999999997,3807.7599999999998, What people people being able to go back and read everything they've ever said online would be really embarrassing for the
3808.7200000000003,3812.5600000000004, Defront up day sx3 so in any order. I've been meaning to ask Paul
3813.5600000000004,3818.1200000000003, Being a former you know team fortress clan leader what your thoughts on team fortress two are and
3818.8,3821.84, Warren to ask you how much hope you have in
3822.0400000000004,3826.2400000000002, Day sx3 and it being a good game and answer the simultaneous
3828.6400000000003,3834.8," Hey, yeah, dx3. I you know I talk to the guys that I'd ask and you know if I if I if I weren't"
3834.8,3838.1600000000003," Completely thrilled and happy to be a part of Disney, you know"
3838.1600000000003,3840.1600000000003, I it'd be really cool to be a part of that
3841.28,3845.04, I have I have hopes. I mean I don't know the guys working on it. I'm not gonna claim I do
3846.0800000000004,3851.28, But certainly you know their hearts seem to be in the right place and I'm just glad that that someone's doing it
3851.28,3853.28, I mean that that's a world that
3853.84,3858.04, There were so a lot of stories. I wanted to tell on that universe and I still love those dent and boys
3858.04,3864.0800000000004, You know I'm glad it's coming to have a free to consult with you if I I can't have anything to do with it
3864.16,3868.16, I mean that's I that that would be you know helping a competitor get stronger sadly
3869.44,3871.2799999999997, I'll just be a player what it'll be cool to
3872.64,3879.6, For team fortress two I think you know I was because I was one of the kind of original team fortress one clan players back in like late
3879.88,3883.2, 97 and stuff when team fortress two was first announced
3884.64,3889.88, Robin Walker and John Cook you know the guys who were the original team fortress team that had been hired by Valve
3889.88,3892.88, They came out to ECTS and London in 1998 and
3893.28,3895.28, At the time I was writing news for
3896.0,3899.36, Like tiny fans like called the UK fortress news desk
3903.92,3909.52, And so we dispatched the report that to go to ECTS and kind of interviewed John Cook and Robin Walker
3909.52,3912.8, And we got some some screenshots and things and I remember you know
3913.6,3920.8, Posting up these screenshots and and there was this kind of image of a of a of a medic healing a guy who was manning a gun and
3920.96,3926.0800000000004, Shooting out a window at somebody and there was a helicopter in the background or something and I just remember thinking you know
3926.0800000000004,3932.32, This game is gonna be so absolutely amazing and that's the power of a chief idea a single screenshot or a couple of things
3932.48,3937.92, Because what they released team fortress two is really I mean to be fair team fortress classic incredibly
3938.4,3945.44," Well executed with a ton more polish and everything else, but it's basically a very very similar game with but with a whole new art style"
3946.0,3948.88, And working really well on the consoles and being
3949.2000000000003,3954.2400000000002, One fifth of our inch box and just everything about the way it's been executed is absolutely perfect
3954.7200000000003,3959.04, So I think that you know cut us about for doing doing something really good the fact is that
3959.36,3967.12, Team fortress has a game type was incredibly good fun in 1997-98 apart from you know the brief kind of release of team fortress classic and you know
3967.12,3970.7200000000003, I think maybe 5% of the online Valve community play TFC
3971.6800000000003,3973.6800000000003, Compared to Counter strike and the other really big games
3974.0,3982.72," So it isn't the big big half-life game the original team fortress classic, but but to reimplement it as as something new and fresh and you know"
3982.72,3983.72, Things like those
3983.72,3988.64, You know getting rewards that that tell you things you've achieved in your past life and all that kind of stuff
3988.64,3994.6, They're just it's tons and tons and tons of very small ideas executed really really well with a fantastic art style
3994.9199999999996,3999.72, Some super marketing like the character movies and things and then released to a console audience
3999.72,4003.72, Which of course has never had any experience of team fortress to whatsoever in the past?
4003.9599999999996,4008.7599999999998, So I think it's just yeah really really really well done have you personally been able to get into it though?
4008.7599999999998,4010.7599999999998, I mean all right now you feel compelled to play it
4011.64,4013.48, It's weird because of you know
4013.48,4020.4399999999996," Because obviously I can't talk about what we're working on next, but it's taken me in lots of different directions for kind of reviewing"
4021.3199999999997,4025.0, You know other people's games and things and I had the the honor of being
4025.72,4027.72, Baffed a judge last year
4028.68,4033.56, Although I had to play 15 RPGs and two weeks and then makes some kind of
4034.04,4036.2799999999997, Sensitive which one should be correct
4038.7599999999998,4042.56, And you know that one of the one of the really ironic things is that one of the games
4043.6,4050.0, Was a I played all weekend to get my character to the level where I could actually play the expansion pack and Mel that was said
4050.0,4056.64, You know I've played this game for 27 hours and I'm still at like level 10 and I'm supposed to get as a level 20 before I can open up the expansion
4056.64,4060.8799999999997, They said oh we could just send you an account for that on menus like that would have been good to have in advance
4063.3599999999997,4069.24," So he's saying but yeah, I've managed to play a whole ton of stuff that I didn't get to do"
4069.6,4073.68," Including Sean you sent me a recommended games list as well. Thank you very much for that. Yeah, the problem"
4073.68,4077.7599999999998, I mean because this wasn't when you were deep in the middle of our everything quick
4077.7599999999998,4080.72," Worst you were you know, I was asking you do you have time to play any games. Yeah"
4080.72,4085.3599999999997, I think I think almost once it's good at the point you've gone beat and I mean for us
4085.36,4090.52, You know a good beta where it is kind of six months between beta and then and then actually code releasing
4091.04,4095.44, There's just nothing that you complain another game that can have any impact whatsoever on what you're doing
4095.44,4098.32, Because what you're trying to do is just polish everything else that you're working on right now
4098.32,4101.32, So it's too late to really change features add additional ideas and stuff
4101.4400000000005,4104.72, So that was all just kind of head down get the game done for the team
4104.72,4108.72, And I probably worked less hours than anybody else in my company doing that period
4108.72,4110.88, I mean everybody was crunching so hard
4111.2,4116.16, You know to get the game finished for the PC release and then as soon as that that finished
4116.400000000001,4121.52," We started working on updates and there was some basic design work, you know for improving accessibility and stuff"
4121.52,4127.24, But I had a lot more free time so I've just played I can't it's one of those horrible questions because when everyone says to me
4127.24,4129.6, So watch a lot of movies and I think you were I've got like
4129.84,4133.76, 2000 DVDs at home and so I do is watch movies and they say so what did you like recently?
4133.76,4138.4800000000005, It's like I can't remember anything I've watched and yet I know I've watched 20 films in the past three months
4138.48,4142.16, But I can't actually think suddenly if I'm asked on the spot something I particularly liked
4142.48,4146.719999999999, But I think going complete you're going to the grain for sandbox game play
4146.719999999999,4151.679999999999, I think the Assassin's Creed really stands out for me recently as just being fun for a good few hours
4151.679999999999,4153.599999999999, Just really had a good time with it for good few hours
4153.599999999999,4157.679999999999, I know I understand why people have said you know it can get a bit repetitive and all that kind of stuff
4157.679999999999,4161.679999999999, But I played it for five six hours and then I haven't had time to go back to it since so I'm not left with that
4161.679999999999,4164.959999999999, I haven't finished it yet so maybe if I finish it I'd feel more frustrated or whatever
4164.959999999999,4167.44, But I really enjoyed that and that's been cool for me
4169.04,4174.879999999999," Yeah, the game is on your recently played list. Well team fortress two certainly has taken over my office"
4175.5199999999995,4180.16," Sadly, I'm not sadly not because it's a bad game but because we really need to be working on other stuff"
4181.5199999999995,4186.16, And rock man. I'm in them all over rock man and I'm kind of a DS for you
4186.16,4190.32," I mean, you know, I'd finally got around finishing the late as Eldegame"
4191.04,4195.839999999999, Just I've been playing that what do you think I love fanomers glass? I thought it was terrific. Well game
4196.0,4199.4400000000005, I've been liking it all except for I mean I've heard it's come up a bit
4199.4400000000005,4205.92," But just the ocean king temple. I mean how they constantly like shuttle you back there. Yeah, it gets a little easier for you stick stick with it"
4206.16,4209.360000000001," Stick with it. Um, you know, so I've been doing a bunch of that and"
4210.24,4217.360000000001," Mostly what I do is I play you know two three hours of a game and say okay, I've pretty much gotten what I need out of this one and and move on to the next"
4217.76,4221.92, Do you find that I mean both you said Paul you see you play five hours of Assassin's Creed where
4222.8,4226.96, Just the way that we actually play games doesn't always match up with the way that
4227.36,4232.0, There may to be played or the way that that when you hear people talk about how games are supposed to work
4232.4,4236.96, Cuz I mean like recently I've been getting grief for you know playing a few games for about five hours or so
4236.96,4242.24, And then deciding that they weren't entertaining. I was no longer gonna take you play him and it's either like
4242.64,4246.88," Well, it's your moral obligation to finish it or like Zelda I was actually thinking I was like you know"
4247.2,4251.2, Had this ended at the point where I'm playing now. I would have felt satisfied that I had got my money
4251.28,4255.92, I don't think that I mean people that make movies know that they need to keep your attention past the first half an hour
4255.92,4260.48, And if you don't enjoy a movie after the first half an hour 45 minutes or maybe around the hour
4260.639999999999,4264.16, Especially if you're at home and there's other things you could be doing or other movies you could be watching
4264.5599999999995,4270.8, I'm the quickest at like just stopping the DVD and just thinking and I get there a couple of movies recently where I thought that
4270.96,4275.44, And one movie in particular where I was so offended by the first kind of 20 minutes of the movie
4275.84,4277.84, I actually snap the DVD in half
4277.92,4279.12, What would be worth if you got it?
4279.12,4285.92, It was just something where this hideous rap scene that was completely gratuitous and irrelevant and unnecessary and and it was done
4286.4800000000005,4292.88, Absolutely for titillation not for not as any part of the story or anything and it just really frustrated me and I just thought it was a shame
4293.360000000001,4297.6," But um, but and I think it's the same with games. I think people you know as as"
4298.08,4303.84," Obviously games are much more expensive and they're supposed to promise much longer experiences, but the latest call of duty for is what like"
4304.24,4308.64, Five hours people some people in my office can complete it into a three now. I think I mean
4308.64,4312.96," You know, but it doesn't stop it being a really really really cool game"
4313.28,4319.04, So I think that's probably quite a good thing if we can bring down kind of people's perceptions of how long they need to play for to have fun
4319.2,4323.28," Yeah, I'm a total of six to eight hours is the right length for a game sort of guy these days"
4323.28,4328.64," Right, it's with that too. The the problem is it's so expensive to make high quality"
4328.64,4334.160000000001, 68 hours because your game boy every time exact unless you have a level where you're like manning a gun for 10 minutes
4334.160000000001,4337.52, So what the enemies are gonna keep coming. This is the really yeah
4338.0,4342.64, I just I can't deal with the the the 20 30 40 hour game anymore
4342.64,4346.0," You know, and I don't know many people who can I think it depends on the type of game"
4346.0,4347.12, I mean I
4347.92,4349.92, I played tons and tons of
4350.320000000001,4356.64, Of oblivion and I know Richard is here now. He's played that for like 110 hours now his here's oblivion game
4357.12,4362.8," I'm up around the kind of 15 20 mark and really enjoying it, but it's something I can go back to him play and then carry on playing"
4362.8,4366.72, And I know I'm gonna have exactly the same opinion of Fallout 3 when it comes out that I'm just
4366.96,4370.96, Really looking forward to just exploring the universe. That's actually what I want to do with the game
4370.96,4372.56, It's not so much about
4372.56,4376.88, Following the rail and getting to the end as fast as I can well I definitely not the real guy
4376.88,4380.72, I mean I hate games about me on rails and and tell me to go but
4382.0,4384.8," You know, I I can't do it. You just describe it. You know"
4384.96,4386.4800000000005, It's like
4386.4800000000005,4392.320000000001," Bioshock you know, I think Bioshock's a swell game. I mean, it's it's very much, you know the kind of game that I like to make"
4392.320000000001,4393.92, It's very much the kind of game I like to play
4394.64,4401.84," I know the guys who made it. They you know, we all sort of came up through through the origin looking glass sort of sort of philosophy and and"
4402.24,4404.24," You know, but I got to"
4404.24,4407.12," Well, I don't want to reveal anything, but I got through a particular point where I went"
4407.68,4412.320000000001, Great. I've played this game for about six hours. I had a climactic moment
4412.639999999999,4418.24," There was a there was a little you know, sort of reward after that and then I got dropped back in the game again"
4418.24,4425.28, And it's like oh my god. I've got like a bunch more to do here and I I'm already done and and so I kind of stopped
4425.28,4430.24," I'm gonna come back to it and I tried to come back to it and I had lost the skills, you know"
4430.24,4436.16, Like there's there's this muscle memory you get when you're playing a game and so and and dropping back into the middle of a game
4436.16,4438.88, After not playing it for you know a couple of months
4439.28,4446.16," I can't do it and so now I'm kind of stuck as I really do want to finish it and the first time I've confessed that I haven't finished the game, you know"
4446.16,4450.16," Which bugs me, but I I don't have the stomach to start it over from the game"
4450.16,4454.72, I think it has to do with how competing the stories as well because if you specifically about shooters and things
4454.72,4456.0, I mean for me
4456.24,4461.2, Deus Ex is still is definitely one of my I mean even having played half life two recently and stuff like that
4461.2,4465.76, Which I was really I really don't know which would now kind of vibe for the top spot for me
4465.84,4472.0, Whether it be Deus Ex or whether it be half life two but but I was I think that it would be I mean
4472.96,4477.04, Deus Ex had a cool story with the illuminati and stuff like that and I just found it incredibly
4477.04,4482.4800000000005, Interesting and at the time you know personally I was reading about the prior of Zion or something like that
4482.4800000000005,4488.96, I don't think I'm quite about the prior of Zion the whole plot of of the Da Vinci code rise in the original
4488.96,4490.96, I'm just I think it's I
4492.0,4494.0, For that
4495.76,4503.04, The prior is Zion in there and the blood lot the blood line of of Christ well that stuff and I pulled it out because
4503.04,4505.04," Hey, I didn't think you two video"
4506.4800000000005,4508.4800000000005," Hey, I"
4508.4800000000005,4510.4800000000005, I'm gonna ignore you guys keep talking
4511.360000000001,4516.72, It was appropriate for a game to really kind of challenge people's religious beliefs that way and and and
4516.72,4520.320000000001, But also I just didn't think anybody would believe it even though it was like it was right out of you know
4521.2,4525.4400000000005," The the they're oh god, what was the book? Holy blood holy grail, you know all right"
4525.5199999999995,4532.24, And and I mean I read that book and I went oh we got to put this in the game and I cut it out and then like you know two years later the
4532.24,4533.44, The division cook I was like oh
4533.679999999999,4540.96," But the thing was that yeah, that's a good example because I think like I don't because I'd read a fair amount about the prior of Zion and about"
4540.96,4544.879999999999, Kind of different aluminum and our teorganizations like you know and and you know
4544.879999999999,4550.5599999999995, All these kind of rumors about you know nice templar being the 12th degree of free masonry and all this cool stuff
4551.04,4554.72, Whether dementia came code came out it wasn't really like your revelations
4554.72,4559.84, Means like really there's this stuff with this you know and everyone's country and say have you heard about this and that's like for
4559.92,4564.56," Everybody knows about it. Oh, they and so I didn't find it that compelling and I tried reading the book and I"
4564.56,4567.6, I read it for a couple of hours and put it down and forgot to go back to it
4567.6,4573.52, And I watched the movie for about half an hour and turned it off and it just didn't grab me at all because I thought I'd been interested in that for a few years
4573.52,4576.240000000001," And it was it wasn't a new subject for me, but I think"
4576.8,4580.5599999999995, I think that's the perfect example of the idea. I think going back to you know
4581.36,4586.88, And I also go when we're talking about it is the fact that I think there's a bunch of us who think we had the idea for
4586.88,4592.24, Devin chicote before it became famous and that we all should have we all should have done it
4592.48,4595.76, But the on the day of sex thing to get to the point I was making earlier
4596.0,4601.5199999999995, I wanted to complete it because I wanted to know what happened in the end and then you bastard
4601.5199999999995,4603.84, You didn't really like finish it off properly and I had all the
4607.2,4609.2," Yeah, sorry about that"
4611.2,4612.88, But the
4612.88,4620.32, I mean our Ed Stern his our senior game designer at splash damage. I mean he's he's an absolutely amazing writer and he loves the same stuff
4620.32,4624.5599999999995, You know this idea that there is a really compelling story that drives things and I think the challenge
4625.36,4630.24," You lay down a challenge earlier for multiplayer game development, which was that it should incorporate more story"
4630.5599999999995,4635.76, And I think Sean would probably agree that that's pretty much all we've done for the past five or six years is tried to introduce
4636.24,4640.16, You know the pursuit of military objectives with the proper setting with the proper plot and all that kind of stuff
4640.16,4644.5599999999995," And it is a real challenge, but we but we have an advantage over the pure single-player stuff"
4644.96,4650.639999999999, In that we have all of their stuff that we can go look at for reference about how to execute really really good story
4651.04,4653.44, Whereas of course in single-player gaming
4654.16,4656.719999999999, You know until the the only way to truly simulate
4656.96,4662.96, You know the complete unpredictability of a human playing against you is to make it an almost unplayable human you know enemy
4663.5199999999995,4665.5199999999995, You know with it with AI
4665.84,4672.4800000000005, Whereas of course in multiplayer combat people just do really crazy stupid silly funny things and that's something that we really enjoy doing
4672.4800000000005,4676.56, So for for single-player where they're given the challenge of boring these cool things for multiplayer
4676.56,4679.360000000001, It's like how do we emulate the better human where it's for multiplayer
4679.360000000001,4682.320000000001, It's like how do we tell a better story or just play all these single-player games?
4682.320000000001,4685.120000000001, They'll teach us how to do that right so we're really really
4685.120000000001,4688.56, I know that I looked a single player against for a much advice about how to tell stories
4690.080000000001,4691.84, I guess how to execute the narrative
4691.84,4695.4400000000005," Yeah, I haven't experienced one of these days. I'm gonna I got a blog post or an"
4695.52,4697.52, article or writer and lecture to give or something
4697.52,4700.320000000001, I haven't figured out yet so don't push me too hard on this
4700.320000000001,4704.88, But I've been thinking about things in terms of like the the act to problem that games have I mean like the
4705.6,4709.52, You know movies and books and and TV shows they have you know the sort of three acts
4709.52,4713.6, Strunged right you know you get the you set up the situation you get the character in trouble
4713.6,4719.040000000001," Yeah, you chase the character up a tree you know and throw rocks at them and then you get them out of the tree"
4719.040000000001,4721.200000000001, And that's the the sort of basic storyline and
4722.0,4725.120000000001, For us and that works great in in the context of you know a
4725.12,4731.92," 200 or 300 page novel or a two hour movie, but when you're trying to fill 12 15 hours it's like you do your set up"
4731.92,4739.12, That takes you an hour you've got your conclusion that takes you a couple of hours and then you've got the act to problem
4739.12,4744.32, Which is you know he did this and then he did this and then he did this and then he did this and then he did this and then he did this and then he did this
4744.32,4749.2, And everybody goes to sleep and then everybody forget about your story got that's where the short games can come in
4749.2,4752.0," Exactly, I want shorter games so we can tell better stories"
4752.0,4757.6, That's why I got that portal work so well for one thing yeah because that game did tell story
4758.32,4761.52, And they got in they told it and then they got out
4761.52,4765.52," You know there was nothing superfluous in there. Yeah, I mean game stories are"
4766.0,4769.44, Full of filler and and it's it's because we charge
4769.76,4776.0, You know $60 for a game now and we have to because we charge so much we have to give you value for money
4776.24,4778.88, Which means we have to give you 20 hours a game play
4779.2,4785.92, You know it's like it's like it's the like saying with bioshock a game that I I totally think is you know a 90 plus review score game
4785.92,4790.4800000000005, I mean absolutely and I'd be frankly for the audio. It's worth you know it was worth the price
4790.4800000000005,4793.76, I mean but you know I got to the point where I
4794.56,4798.24, felt like I had done what I wanted to do and needed to do and then it kept on going you know
4798.24,4801.84, And that's like and I'm not singling them out sorry can I'm not singling you guys out
4802.16,4805.36, It's that's the way games are structured now and I think we need to solve that problem
4805.92,4807.92, And I don't know how all right tell you
4808.0,4816.56, You brought up a religious themes and gaming and correct me if I'm wrong with in the past you expressed interest in making a game based on the golden compass
4816.96,4818.24," Oh, yeah"
4818.64,4822.72," So uh, and how would you I mean any thoughts on that? I mean how would you handle that?"
4822.72,4826.8, I mean what what specifically? I mean do you think it's possible to hand to handle religious themes?
4826.96,4833.04, Yeah sure. I mean you know it's it's you have to have the right publisher and the right partners and you know
4833.6,4836.56, Either decide you're I mean you have to be respectful right? I mean it's not
4837.2,4840.64, You don't want to just say oh you guys are idiots for believing what you believe so
4840.64,4845.36, you know I think I think Philip Pullman made a real challenge in the
4845.76,4848.56, His dark material series you know in the books especially he made a really
4849.36,4854.24, Kind of compelling argument that doesn't usually get made that hey maybe you guys should think about what you believe
4854.4,4858.08, Not not you shouldn't believe it well I think pullman believes you shouldn't believe it but
4858.72,4862.08, That isn't what I took from the books and that's not what I took from the movie you know
4862.16,4864.8, It's just hey think about this you know if you're if you're belief
4865.44,4867.92, Can't stand up to to that kind of challenge?
4868.24,4871.2, Maybe you should rethink your belief and if it can more power to you
4871.2,4874.88, I didn't see the movie but my understanding was that it had been kind of
4875.5199999999995,4877.5199999999995, Bleached out they don't it down a little bit yeah
4877.5199999999995,4881.92," Yeah, they don't at least than I expected based on you know hearing about it before the movie came out"
4882.5599999999995,4886.24, And if you've read the books you certainly can you can read between the lines and it's all still there
4886.48,4889.44, It didn't seem like yeah saved them any controversy though because now
4890.08,4891.28, certainly
4891.28,4896.5599999999995, Still vastly protested and well the protest started before the movie was even out right
4896.5599999999995,4902.639999999999," Right idea of the movie exactly. Yeah, I like you just one there again. Yeah"
4904.24,4909.12, And I mean the from what I remember of the books it was really more that the organized
4909.5199999999995,4911.5199999999995, aspect of it itself rather than
4912.24,4916.16," Well, I mean I think you're right I think he has actually come out and just said it he's an atheist right"
4917.12,4920.4, But but I believe that the the primary thrust was against
4920.8,4927.84," Organized religion per se as opposed to belief exactly. Oh, that's that's what I took from the books and right yeah, yeah for sure"
4928.48,4934.24," You know and it almost doesn't matter what he thinks he was writing about it matters, you know how you interpret what he wrote"
4934.24,4938.0," Sure, but I wonder you know to Sean's question if if you"
4938.5599999999995,4945.76, Any game maker who was taking on that kind of story would have maybe even more pressure than a movie studio did in
4945.92,4947.2, Not
4947.2,4951.12, Broaching that particular subject is just doing a story about armored bears
4951.76,4958.08, The response to the hot coffee in the sexuality and video games and when that's so extreme you tend to think that it's just going to be that much
4958.08,4962.64, You know that you'll have an equivalent response to any sort of religious theme that what I think you have to be careful
4963.04,4968.16, As a game developer you know one of the things I'm I'm actually pretty happy about in the game businesses that we have a
4969.04,4972.24," Really pretty good rating system, you know"
4972.24,4976.719999999999," It's it's probably the best rating system of of any rating system in any medium, you know"
4976.719999999999,4981.76, You can you can look at the back of a box and really get a pretty good idea of what you're about to get and and so
4982.08,4988.4, You know like Deus Ex was was rated M and you know we knew we were gonna give up some sales as a result and that was fine with me
4988.4,4994.96," I I never wanted kids playing that game not because it's bloodier violent or whatever, you know"
4994.96,4999.599999999999, People want to think or it's just because I didn't think kids should have to think about
4999.92,5004.08," Do I trust my government, you know should the world be you know"
5005.68,5009.52," Kids should not think about if you's a free will and what it means to be human, you know"
5009.76,5011.76, But once you get above the age of you know
5012.4800000000005,5016.96," 14 15 16 it's okay to start thinking about that stuff, you know, so I am an emrade a game 17 what is what is the am it?"
5016.96,5018.96, I guess it's 16 up or 17
5018.96,5021.360000000001, I don't know you know so once you get to that age
5021.360000000001,5024.88," Hey, we're all enough to buy them start thinking about that stuff"
5024.88,5028.08, So I was pretty pleased and if I made a game based on his dark materials
5028.16,5031.92, I would want to make it an emrade a game too and that's the reason why I didn't get to well
5031.92,5035.76, There are many reasons why I didn't get to make it and it was probably a good thing for everybody concerned
5035.76,5039.68, I think also if that the emrating I mean certainly in the UK
5040.32,5045.04, It's that you know we have a different rating space it's the same thing having the emrating is the only way you know
5045.04,5047.68, What you should be watching and playing when you're 12 or 13
5048.32,5050.32, Because they're
5051.12,5056.64," Oh, yeah, I mean it's not like there's any lack of a religious material in games though"
5056.72,5063.360000000001, I mean Japanese games tend to have like really heavy religious content like I've been playing a devil make cry for
5063.84,5070.240000000001, This last week and it's just all these like imagery of crosses and angel right and it's like virtually
5070.56,5072.56, Content free but
5072.56,5076.240000000001, But a specific indictment of of organized religion or something
5076.240000000001,5080.72," I think is different than having like the demons and yeah, although in this in the game"
5080.72,5084.320000000001, It's like your the sort of main bad guys this kind of
5085.28,5088.759999999999, Bishop Pope kind of figure who turns it that Christ
5088.759999999999,5090.759999999999, You know I
5090.759999999999,5094.04, It's funny bringing that up because you know we were talking earlier about bad game ideas
5094.04,5098.16," I don't actually think this is a bad idea, but I had a proposal that was shopping around a while ago"
5099.44,5105.36, After I left I am storming and started junction point which was basically the starting point for that game was what it
5105.84,5107.36, What if every
5107.36,5111.5199999999995, world's religion was real and and what if tomorrow
5112.4800000000005,5117.360000000001, Absolute irrefutable evidence that that that God exists
5118.240000000001,5121.52, What if that appeared tomorrow and and nobody could deny it anymore?
5121.52,5126.040000000001, What would that do to the world and I built a whole game around a game idea around that and
5126.400000000001,5128.64, That a lot of apologizing to do on this podcast
5129.280000000001,5134.84," That's so good great. I mean it's something good. Well, nobody was it was not it was not the Western God"
5134.84,5139.64, It was not it was not it was it was if every world's religion was proved to be true
5139.64,5144.860000000001, It's just a different facet of of something that really really really existed and no one could deny it anymore
