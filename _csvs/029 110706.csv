10.82,17.96, Company of Heroes is recently given a top score of 10 out of 10 that I won at the dot com.
17.96,22.240000000000002, Hello and welcome to the GFW Radio podcast.
22.240000000000002,26.44," This is the podcast for November 6th, 2006."
26.44,31.400000000000002," This is Jeff Green, the editor-in-chief of GFW Magazine."
31.400000000000002,35.52," And I'm here with the gang of GFW, which includes."
35.52,38.760000000000005," Brian Scott, Darren Gladstone, Sean, and Elliot."
38.760000000000005,39.760000000000005," Oh, I'm a lawyer."
39.760000000000005,40.760000000000005," Hello, John."
40.760000000000005,42.2, This is to go backwards next time.
42.2,43.2, Just to mix it up.
43.2,45.56," Yeah, we should mix it up."
45.56,46.56, We do that now.
46.56,47.56," No, that'd be waste."
47.56,48.56," Well, it'd be a waste of airtime."
48.56,49.56," No, we shouldn't."
49.56,51.120000000000005," Okay, we won't do that."
51.120000000000005,56.120000000000005, So we've had a kind of busy week here at the ranch.
56.16,57.12, What is it?
57.12,58.28," Yeah, that's one way to say it."
58.28,59.64, I think we've agreed.
59.64,62.12, We're not going to be labor this point too much.
62.12,68.03999999999999, You can read any of the 8 billion posts all over the internet about our fun last few
68.03999999999999,70.47999999999999, days.
70.47999999999999,74.32," But I can't say as a result of all this, I can tell you what I'm now playing in the"
74.32,76.56, what you're playing section of this podcast.
76.56,80.12, I'm playing never winter nights too.
80.12,84.92," I figured if it was going to take over my whole life, I might as well play the damn thing."
84.92,88.84," So yeah, that's what I'm playing."
88.84,91.48, And so do I say how I'm enjoying it or not?
91.48,92.48, I think you should.
92.48,94.48, You owe it to the people.
94.48,96.52, I kind of them.
96.52,98.32000000000001, There's two games in Never Winter nights.
98.32000000000001,102.32000000000001, The first game is figuring out how to get it to run on your machine.
102.32000000000001,103.84, Another one of these.
103.84,106.08," So yeah, it's another one of those."
106.08,112.28," And so my first hour, so it was a zero star game because I could not freaking get it to"
112.28,113.28, run.
113.28,118.84," After I turned down basically every effect and I was rated in 800 by 600, then it was"
118.84,121.56, playable for the most part.
121.56,123.44," Look, what graphics are you using for this?"
123.44,124.84," Well, it's just a 6800."
124.84,128.4, But I got two gigs of RAM.
128.4,130.16," You know, I have a fast processor."
130.16,136.8," I mean, my graphics card doesn't need an upgrade, but I'll tell you here at GFW world."
136.8,138.96, I ran it today.
138.96,140.4, And it was basically the same thing.
140.4,141.4, It's still ran.
141.4,142.4, It's still ran Poke as hell.
142.44,146.64000000000001," Did you have to turn off the environmental normal mapping, which was the word that everyone"
146.64000000000001,148.08, has been having to do?
148.08,153.44," No, I did have to turn shadows all the way off that I had to do."
153.44,154.96, And there's big camera issues.
154.96,157.24, It's a pain in the took a sat way.
157.24,159.20000000000002, There's some serious technical issues here.
159.20000000000002,165.32," However, after I got over all that and slogged my way through the opening boring part,"
165.32,167.04000000000002, I did start enjoying it.
167.04000000000002,169.6, I can see a lot about this campaign that's going to be fun.
169.6,173.64, It has some airmarks of obsidian's humor.
173.64,175.64, I don't know.
175.64,177.79999999999998, We'll see.
177.79999999999998,180.6," But actually, all of this is just to deflect from the..."
180.6,182.32, Let's give us an example of the humor.
182.32,186.24," Because last week, Ryan told us about the, whatever, the Drake's on the platform."
186.24,187.24, Great.
187.24,188.24, Great to play.
188.24,189.24," Okay, so there's this."
189.24,190.51999999999998, There's this dwarf.
190.51999999999998,192.12, There's this dwarf.
192.12,194.24, And he drinks a lot.
194.24,196.92, He wants to fight people everywhere.
196.92,197.92," Hi, Larry."
197.92,198.92, He's afraid of water.
199.23999999999998,202.64," No, but he like every time he meets someone, he goes like,"
202.64,203.92, I'm gonna hit you.
203.92,205.07999999999998, Thank you.
205.07999999999998,206.95999999999998, There's a lot of funny.
206.95999999999998,209.27999999999997, I can't stop laughing.
209.27999999999997,211.44, But you were pretty earnest when you saw that.
211.44,212.44," No, I was pointing."
212.44,213.44," No, it is."
213.44,214.72, So so I can't give you an example.
214.72,217.04," I can't, I'm not gonna tell never win or night jokes."
217.04,218.16," Well, you could give an example."
218.16,221.2," You could be like, yes, I'll bore out the other night and he comes out and goes,"
221.2,224.48," my wife, Savah, Jean, it's like a wizard's thief."
224.48,226.67999999999998, And I did the sheetiest impression of him.
226.67999999999998,227.67999999999998, Okay.
227.67999999999998,228.67999999999998, But it's the content.
228.68,231.52, I really say that nothing in everyone or night's too is funny is anything
231.52,232.52, borrets.
232.52,233.52, Okay.
233.52,237.0," But there's like good, reparté between the NPCs."
237.0,240.72," You know, these guys like in, well, they didn't make code to her,"
240.72,242.04000000000002, but they make code to her too.
242.04000000000002,244.64000000000001," You know, the NPCs are sort of like arguing with each other"
244.64000000000001,246.44, and not approving of what you do.
246.44,251.0," And it's sort of like done in a very, I mean, a very good,"
251.0,254.92000000000002, they will actually respond to your behavior in the game with snarky
254.92000000000002,257.08," comments, which is always cool in games like this."
257.15999999999997,260.2," These are the guys who created like, you know, I swindale stuff like that."
260.2,260.35999999999996, Right.
260.35999999999996,264.28," I mean, the Axie, the designer was the lead designer of Plainscape"
264.28,266.52," torment, which is one of the, one of the,"
266.52,268.35999999999996, that's the RPGs maybe ever.
268.35999999999996,271.44," So, you know, this is no B team of designers."
271.44,272.71999999999997, This is an A team.
272.71999999999997,276.12," And the game is, it's pretty good, but, you know,"
276.12,280.79999999999995, there's some technical crap here in the way that's definitely not good.
280.79999999999995,283.15999999999997, And you haven't had a chance to play the tool set at all because
283.15999999999997,284.15999999999997, not at all.
284.15999999999997,286.4," Yeah, actually, I'm going to try to get that going like for next week"
286.4,288.4," because I want to try to create a module, my own, but,"
288.4,291.4," I know, I'm probably seeing way too much already, but,"
291.4,294.4," because I mean, to me, like everyone makes a big debate with the campaign"
294.4,296.96," that I always feel, I mean, so I was actually reading the,"
296.96,299.76, some comments on Pony Arcade earlier and they made a really good point
299.76,301.56," that, that's just like the campaign."
301.56,303.91999999999996, It's just kind of like a base level to kind of get you started.
303.91999999999996,304.76," Well, yeah, right."
304.76,306.03999999999996," I mean, never went in a night one."
306.03999999999996,307.03999999999996, It was the same way.
307.03999999999996,310.32, The campaign in both these games is basically just like an example
310.32,312.15999999999997, of what you could do with the tool set.
312.15999999999997,315.35999999999996, This game has always been about empowering the gamer
315.36,319.16, to make their own D&D adventure.
319.16,324.0, I do think that these guys sort of sitting in made a good one this time.
324.0,325.88," And in fact, this campaign is to me,"
325.88,329.52000000000004," feels much better than the first one, which I thought was just drives"
329.52000000000004,330.36, dirt.
330.36,331.56, I couldn't even get through that one.
331.56,332.96000000000004, I think that's so boring.
332.96000000000004,336.48," You didn't actually, in the first thing, you didn't even get any,"
336.48,338.44," where you got one companion, right?"
338.44,339.92, One NPC.
339.92,343.04," I mean, you're party and I think you couldn't even control him."
343.20000000000005,345.64000000000004," So at least this feels more like a real RPG again,"
345.64000000000004,349.0, where you've got a party of four people that you can control
349.0,351.72, on an individual basis and they level up with you.
351.72,353.36, You can give them equipment.
353.36,358.28000000000003," It feels like a real party based RPG, which I like."
359.56,360.08000000000004, There.
360.08000000000004,360.92, Look good.
360.92,361.92, Isn't that good for me?
361.92,362.28000000000003, Yeah.
362.28000000000003,365.6, It makes me like the D&D movie again.
365.6,367.40000000000003, Marlin Williams needs to come back.
367.40000000000003,369.40000000000003," I mean, does it want to see some sort of yak?"
369.40000000000003,373.0, Do we want to talk about the pulling of their review or not?
373.24,375.96," Do we need to, what's there to say?"
375.96,378.92," Well, I, we pulled the review already said million times."
378.92,381.28, I said it online a million times already.
381.28,383.48," Here, if you're curious as to why we pulled the never-winner"
383.48,386.44," nights to review, I encourage you to read my blog."
386.44,391.24," Blogs, blogs at gfwjf.1up.com."
391.24,394.44," Or you can probably just Google it and you can read the 8,000"
394.44,396.52, messages on why I'm a jerk.
396.52,397.56, You can also do that.
397.56,398.84," Wait, was it jerk?"
398.84,401.08," Well, that would be the nice word."
401.08,401.4, Yeah.
401.47999999999996,405.0," Sellout or, hey, it's a step on my territory."
405.0,405.47999999999996, All right.
405.47999999999996,405.96, Run you.
405.96,406.76, Run you.
406.76,407.47999999999996, Run you.
407.47999999999996,408.2, I want to call me a grime.
408.2,410.03999999999996, I'm a little bit slow to let you run you.
410.03999999999996,412.2, Now I'm upset.
412.44,415.32," So, you know, it's all there online."
415.32,419.08," You can, you can see all my angst and full display."
419.08,420.76," And let's move on, huh?"
420.76,421.47999999999996, Yeah.
421.47999999999996,422.76," What are you playing, Ryan?"
422.76,424.76, I'm just wrapping up Guild Wars.
424.76,425.71999999999997, Really?
425.71999999999997,427.15999999999997, Surprise.
427.15999999999997,428.12, Rapping it up.
428.12,430.76," Well, I mean, I, well, I just finished the single player"
431.0,434.52," campaign, or I guess in my case, the single player campaign has"
434.52,435.64, it held up.
435.64,436.59999999999997," It has, yeah."
436.59999999999997,439.32, I were 100 on that or help.
439.32,442.2," Anyway, it's, you, did you keep a track of how long this campaign took?"
442.2,447.08," Um, no, I know it took."
447.88,451.15999999999997, I think there was about a difference of about 50 hours at the point that I was
451.15999999999997,453.71999999999997, at the final mission.
453.71999999999997,454.84, I don't know what it's gone up.
454.84,457.0," I played more since then, but."
457.0,458.28, That was a lot of hours.
458.28,459.64, Yeah.
459.64,463.0, But I'd say it's probably out of all the three campaigns.
463.0,464.28, It's probably the best one.
464.28,467.4," If someone's never played any Guild Wars, I would tell you."
467.4,468.12, I wouldn't get this one.
468.12,468.44, Really?
468.44,470.44," I suppose the original, so that's pretty awesome."
470.44,470.84, Yeah.
470.84,471.15999999999997, Really?
471.15999999999997,472.44, That's a recommendation.
472.44,473.96, That says a lot.
473.96,475.8," You know, I mean, that says a lot for them, I think."
475.8,477.4, The third one would be the best.
477.4,478.76," Actually, here's a stupid question for us."
478.76,482.2," So, so if you were to buy the, the third one,"
482.2,486.2," nightfall, all the other character classes are fully unlocked."
486.2,487.8," Or do you, or how, I mean, how does that work?"
487.88,491.64," There, the six main character classes from the original,"
491.64,494.2, come with it with every product.
494.2,495.88, You get those no matter which one you buy.
495.88,498.92," Now, factions had two character classes,"
498.92,500.28000000000003, the assassin and the returist.
500.28000000000003,502.04, You only get those if you own factions.
502.04,502.68, Gotcha.
502.68,503.48, Okay.
503.48,505.0, And the pair gone and he derives.
505.0,507.16," So, okay, so it's not like a cumulative thing."
507.16,511.40000000000003," You actually, there's two character classes tied to each of the two."
511.40000000000003,513.88, It's the pair of gun just like a pallet and pretty much.
513.88,514.36, Yeah.
514.36,515.08, Sounds like a good.
515.08,516.92, It's all group oriented.
517.0,521.0, Why didn't they just call my pallet and they like their little wacky names.
521.0,522.5999999999999, What's the dervish then?
522.5999999999999,529.4," The dervishes, like a hybrid spellcaster and warrior sort of class."
529.4,530.04, Really?
530.04,530.52, Yeah.
530.52,531.3199999999999, Huh.
531.3199999999999,533.0799999999999, Is there a monk?
533.0799999999999,533.7199999999999, There's a monk.
533.7199999999999,535.0," Yeah, I think that's an original."
535.0,535.7199999999999, A healer.
535.7199999999999,536.04, Right.
537.4,540.12," Uh, there's the element list, which is like a,"
540.12,542.1999999999999," your major, you occur, major guy."
542.1999999999999,543.9599999999999," There's the warrior, the ranger."
543.9599999999999,545.0, Do they come warrior?
545.0,545.4, Uh-huh.
545.4,548.12," So they call the warrior warrior, but they call the pallet and a pair of gun."
548.12,548.76, Right.
548.76,550.36, I'm sure there's some lore or reason for that.
551.0,554.6," And then maybe illusionist or enchant or whatever you want to call, they call them"
554.6,555.0, Mezmer.
556.6,557.24, So.
557.24,558.52, They mesmerizes.
558.52,559.3199999999999, Yeah.
559.3199999999999,561.0," Yeah, it's kind of pretentious if you ask me."
561.0,562.52," And the shaman, the colon, Ricky."
562.52,566.04," Yes, as you're eating a caviar while you're hitting wasty."
568.04,570.1999999999999," There's some pretty mid-mismix, excuse me."
570.1999999999999,571.48, Now he's not a wizard.
571.48,572.36, He's a Mezmer.
573.0,574.28, Who takes you fool?
574.36,575.8," Hey, around."
577.56,578.04, I'm sorry.
578.04,579.0799999999999, I mean the pick on your game.
579.0799999999999,581.3199999999999," No, it takes a pretty first really."
581.3199999999999,582.04, I do.
582.04,583.4, It's sitting there next to my computer.
583.4,587.48, I would have been playing at this month or this week if I hadn't had to play a
587.48,588.12, never-winner.
588.12,589.64, I shouldn't say had to.
589.64,590.76, Played never-winner.
590.76,594.28," No, because you're playing a fantasy star universe, right?"
594.28,595.24, Is it a fantasy universe?
595.24,596.4399999999999, I can't see a fairy universe.
596.4399999999999,596.68, Yeah.
597.72,599.3199999999999," There anyone to talk about, fantasy story."
599.3199999999999,599.64, Sure.
599.64,601.8," You were a good first of all, full disclosure."
601.8,604.8399999999999, Where are you playing the PC version or the Xbox 360 version?
604.8399999999999,605.3199999999999," Actually, but..."
605.3199999999999,605.9599999999999, Be honest.
605.9599999999999,609.24," Actually, I want it to compare, compare, contrast, the two."
609.24,609.7199999999999, Okay.
609.7199999999999,611.64, And obviously the PC version looks better.
611.64,615.0799999999999, And the keyboard now center face is works so much better with this game.
615.0799999999999,615.56, Really?
615.56,618.8399999999999," Yeah, I mean granted you can still plug in the 360 controller for windows."
618.8399999999999,619.88, And it'll work.
619.88,624.1999999999999," But it really is a lot easier, especially because you got a type-in chat commands and stuff like that."
624.1999999999999,625.0," So, it just..."
625.0,626.92, Are you playing online or are you playing the single player?
626.92,629.88," Oh, I wasn't playing online because I got a PAN extra 10 bucks for that."
629.88,630.52, No.
630.6,632.04," That's an MMO, isn't it?"
632.04,632.28, No.
632.28,632.76, No.
632.76,634.4399999999999," Or not an MMO, but an MMO."
634.4399999999999,635.16, An MMO.
635.16,639.16, It works similarly to Guild Wars in the multiplayer game.
639.16,640.4399999999999, That's the concept.
640.4399999999999,645.0799999999999," It basically, it's like, you go to a hubworld, you meet before you go into the instances."
645.0799999999999,646.04, But you have to pay more?
646.04,646.76," Oh, damn."
646.76,647.72, That should be free.
647.72,648.76, That's what I was saying.
648.76,650.12, That was the one thing I brought up.
650.12,654.12," I previewed the game and the Ellen Wake issue, I think."
654.12,656.52," But the point was there, I was kind of saying how it's..."
656.52,658.84, It's really cool when they have a full single player game.
658.84,659.84, Yeah.
659.84,662.88," Japanese anime, sci-fi style."
662.88,665.76," And if you're into that thing, cool, but there's some kind of..."
665.76,667.6," I wouldn't say pervy moments, but you'd be..."
667.6,667.76, You'd be...
667.76,668.76, You'd be...
668.76,669.76, I would.
669.76,671.76," Well, I didn't notice the..."
671.76,672.96, The upskirt shots there.
672.96,688.96," Maybe it's from having a daughter myself, but, you know, there's a scene right at the beginning of the single player game, or there's some young girl. And, you know, first she's like far away in the camera, you know, like, oh, that's some like kind of hot chicken, like a little cheerleader laugh at that's an eat."
688.96,691.2800000000001, And then the camera zooms in and she's like 11.
691.2800000000001,692.2800000000001, You know what I mean?
692.2800000000001,693.2800000000001," Like, ah!"
693.2800000000001,695.84," Well, I was thinking that was hot."
695.84,697.2800000000001," This is a horrible, real bad."
697.2800000000001,698.88, We're definitely like a band service.
698.88,699.88, Yeah.
699.88,704.88," And it's a world where, as I was describing, there's a term for a person called the Chikon."
704.88,710.52," And it's basically a pervert, pederast that goes on to public trains and grab schoolmas."
710.52,712.4000000000001," Well, that's how this game made me feel for like..."
712.4000000000001,715.0, It's like I ripped the CD out of the drive.
715.0,717.0," I know, I'm not playing the music."
717.0,718.88, I don't know what the story was more of.
718.88,721.4," In fact, that you noticed, I was a chaky-dy."
721.4,722.4," You were right, right?"
722.4,725.4, I was just another normal moment in Darren's life.
725.4,729.64," Let's even notice, I got a lot of DVDs like this."
729.64,733.88," The rationality's like, hey, well, the porn subscription costs me 99."
733.88,736.52, The game is only 99.
736.52,740.72," But seriously, I mean, it's weird that they would be charging."
740.72,741.72, Right.
741.72,743.84, I'm all for them having a full single player game.
743.84,748.28, And I kind of see where they're going with this multiplayer subscription base model for whatever
748.36,749.28, reason.
749.28,750.28, But what justifies the pain?
750.28,751.28, Right.
751.28,752.28, I think it's not an animal.
752.28,753.28, What are they giving you?
753.28,755.28, Like in terms of how should we already have Xbox Live?
755.28,757.28," It's basically a thing that they basically, yeah."
757.28,760.56," Well, things which you're paying for is the ability to pay other than people, which"
760.56,761.56, you could do with the multiplayer.
761.56,762.56, That's absolutely great.
762.56,763.56, That's exactly right.
763.56,764.56, I totally agree.
764.56,767.9599999999999," And right, if you're playing it on Xbox Live, you're already paying what are"
767.9599999999999,768.9599999999999, Xbox Live?
768.9599999999999,772.36," What about number of like, you know, dungeons and missions because the original game,"
772.36,773.36, when we had four?
773.36,774.36," Well, I think there's more than that."
774.36,775.8399999999999," I mean, they actually address that point."
775.8399999999999,777.36, I don't have an exact number.
777.36,778.36," I mean, right."
778.36,779.64, You've been sent to the worst numbers.
779.64,780.64, Go with an MMO.
780.64,784.72, With an animal game that you're paying money for.
784.72,788.16, You're paying money because it's a service and they're constantly giving you new content.
788.16,789.16, Right.
789.16,790.16, Is fantasy sorry universe going to do that?
790.16,791.16," Again, don't know."
791.16,795.5600000000001," I believe they will, but I can't answer that one with 100% knowledge."
795.5600000000001,797.28," One thing, another thing I kind of bugs me about this."
797.28,801.44," I mean, like so you go through the whole single player campaign and you get to the end,"
801.44,802.84, you get that cinematic pattern on the back.
802.84,803.84, Congratulations.
803.84,804.84, You save the world.
804.84,807.04, And anything you accomplish in the 40 hours of thanks.
808.0,809.52, That's kind of feeble already.
809.52,811.4," Yeah, that's the weakest one yet."
811.4,812.4, I know.
812.4,816.8399999999999," But I mean, so you finish the single player campaign and you get this, you know, congratulations"
816.8399999999999,817.8399999999999, you win.
817.8399999999999,818.8399999999999, That's it.
818.8399999999999,820.8399999999999," There's no like, you can't pass."
820.8399999999999,821.8399999999999, I don't know.
821.8399999999999,825.3199999999999," Just in past 40 hours, been I still pass along some kind of item that I could take to my"
825.3199999999999,826.3199999999999, avatar.
826.3199999999999,828.12, If I were to go online or yeah.
828.12,831.5999999999999," So you can do that with, I mean, Guild Wars, technically is always online, but I do"
831.5999999999999,835.8," in a game like Titanquest, your character, ports over back and forth."
835.8,836.8, So I don't know.
836.8,837.8," It's a shame, really."
837.8,840.52," I mean, I think there's some potential there still and for those who are die hard that"
840.52,841.8, want to get a good experience.
841.8,846.1999999999999," Well, it sounds to me like Sonic the headshot just has some house payments to make."
846.1999999999999,847.1999999999999, You think?
847.1999999999999,848.1999999999999, Yeah.
848.1999999999999,851.4799999999999," Yeah, that could be it."
851.4799999999999,853.68," Actually, I have to pay a new security deposit or something."
853.68,854.68, I don't know.
854.68,855.88," Yeah, I mean, it's lame."
855.88,857.9599999999999," I'm, how's the single player campaign?"
857.9599999999999,861.9599999999999, Because that's the only reason I would actually do it because I like my nostalgia trip
861.9599999999999,865.5999999999999," because I used to like, I'm of the, oh my god, if that is just I do is one of the most"
865.6,866.6," amazing, amazing."
866.6,867.6," These are, yeah."
867.6,869.6," And that respect is pretty, and that respect is okay."
869.6,873.76," I mean, it's like, it's kind of like if it's a fan, if you're a fan of that old school,"
873.76,878.28," sci-fi, anime kind of vibe, so they're knocking."
878.28,879.28, I don't know.
879.28,880.28, They're going.
880.28,884.08," Anyway, so that's, yeah, whoever, that's the deal."
884.08,889.6800000000001," I mean, if you like it, then you'll kind of appreciate the single player part of it, at least."
889.6800000000001,892.84, And we'll have to get my information on what they're offering online.
892.84,893.84, Yeah.
893.84,894.84, See if it's worth $10 a month.
894.84,895.52, Exactly.
895.52,898.28, That's the same deal on the PC as I just know from the outside.
898.28,901.4," I mean, it's the same deal all around, but my knee jerk reaction is, Guild Wars is free."
901.4,903.68, Why can't this be?
903.68,904.68, Here it is.
904.68,905.68, So what's Sean Plan?
905.68,907.68, I'm playing some hot stuff.
907.68,911.88," Basically, I had a nice three day weekend when it's out, and up to the redwood"
911.88,912.88, coast.
912.88,918.84, And so it was there in a miniature golf arcade where I discovered a game called feeding
918.84,919.84, frenzy.
919.84,923.24, And I immediately recognize as something available on popcalfs games.
923.32,924.8," Oh, can I interrupt you for a sec?"
924.8,926.44," Where are you on your anniversary, dude?"
926.44,929.5600000000001," I was in and it was, it was her who wanted to play."
929.5600000000001,931.5600000000001," I mean, we were playing silly miniature golf."
931.5600000000001,933.5600000000001," And it was like, it was like a couple of good rounds there, right?"
933.5600000000001,936.36," Well, it was like located like right next to where we were staying."
936.36,939.04," So, and he wanted to go onto the arcade."
939.04,940.04," Like, he did."
940.04,941.04," Yeah, she totally did."
941.04,942.04, Okay.
942.04,944.0," And so she wanted to play, it's got a track ball."
944.0,948.76, And so we started playing it there and I came home and downloaded feeding frenzy to play
948.76,949.76, with her.
949.76,950.76, I got all into it.
950.84,952.64, Like there are 60 levels in the story mode.
952.64,953.96, I got it yesterday and played all.
953.96,954.96, What is this dog?
954.96,955.96," Oh, feeding frenzy."
955.96,956.96, The story mode.
956.96,959.64," There's like this, some kind of motivation."
959.64,963.24," Alien, benthic like fish that appears in the friendly lagoon."
963.24,968.08," And he's his mystery needs to be solved, but ultimately by shrinking him an eating"
968.08,972.28," him with a, but aside from that, the game's fun."
972.28,975.6," It's, it's, it's an arcade sort of game in the sense that, and normally, you know, when"
975.6,979.3199999999999," I look at popcalf games, I stick to the puzzle type stuff, the begeralds and zoomis, because"
979.32,983.5600000000001," the arcade stuff, like the basically whack them all with nooms or whatever, like elf"
983.5600000000001,987.1600000000001," boolean stuff just like, like, try and rock at medium and I love, I love that game."
987.1600000000001,988.1600000000001," Yeah, we got that."
988.1600000000001,989.1600000000001, We're playing that too.
989.1600000000001,991.1600000000001, That's going to be a popcat fest.
991.1600000000001,992.1600000000001, Yeah.
992.1600000000001,993.1600000000001," Oh, so."
993.1600000000001,998.5200000000001," So the game is, I don't know, just sounds so radity like, what do you play at feeding frenzy"
998.5200000000001,999.5200000000001," to, man?"
999.5200000000001,1004.8000000000001," But you basically a small fish and you go around eating fish smaller than you, while avoiding"
1004.8000000000001,1008.44, fish larger than you until you become larger.
1008.44,1009.44, That's a growth process.
1009.44,1012.44, You can take your fish and work your way up and up.
1012.44,1013.44, It's a game of the game.
1013.44,1014.44, Yeah.
1014.44,1017.44," That's the game on my cell phone called Insana Quarium, which is exactly the same."
1017.44,1018.44," Oh yeah, that's a popcat."
1018.44,1019.44," Yeah, that's another popcat game."
1019.44,1020.44, It's on there.
1020.44,1022.44," It didn't look as cool as, well, I'll check it out."
1022.44,1023.44, Someone's open someone up.
1023.44,1029.04," But, but what's fun about it is that the fish moves, like, so, I mean, if you ever"
1029.04,1032.52," watch, like, you know, David Atmbro, darker something, you see just like a mesmerizing"
1032.52,1035.8400000000001," school of fish, darting back and forth, and you look at it and you're like, I'm not trying"
1035.8400000000001,1036.8400000000001, to get Phil soft going.
1036.84,1040.36, It's a guy who's trying to justify his friends.
1040.36,1049.6599999999999," He's doing the thing, he's moving every week with his face, but basically, there is"
1049.6599999999999,1055.1799999999998," a fund that's a natural kind of like, spasticness that translates well, I guess, into"
1055.1799999999998,1056.1799999999998, gaming.
1056.1799999999998,1057.1799999999998, So I'm trying to say.
1057.1799999999998,1059.52," So it's not the deep or anything, but it's like, it's fun."
1059.52,1061.9199999999998," It's like, you look at it and you're like, hey, this could be whatever, it could"
1061.9199999999998,1063.6599999999999, be just a ball zipping around the screen.
1063.66,1066.26, But it makes sense that it's a fish because they do move this way.
1066.26,1067.26, Right.
1067.26,1071.8600000000001," And you play it in, you know, in all the way that those games do, it increasingly"
1071.8600000000001,1076.6200000000001," complicates the levels as you go, make it so you need to get, like, photo planked into,"
1076.6200000000001,1080.7," keep the diving bell on your, on your deep sea fish illuminated."

1102.8999999999999,1107.22," go to the red, everyone go to the red, you know, no, no, I'm just kidding."
1107.22,1108.22, Don't do that.
1108.22,1110.02, I said that before and gotten trouble.
1110.02,1112.46," We love the red, you know, see, go to the red, you know, it's for them."
1112.46,1113.46, We love them.
1113.46,1115.46," Well, let's, yeah."

1171.14,1172.58, We're gaming was much better.
1172.58,1173.58, Okay.
1173.58,1182.86," So we have 20 minutes, retro, not the big mean retro nuts guys gave us 20 more minutes."
1182.86,1183.86, And gave right a black eye.
1183.86,1185.82, Then they're going to come back and come back and come back again.
1185.82,1187.6599999999999, Here and talk about super Mario Brothers.
1187.6599999999999,1188.6599999999999, Yeah.
1188.6599999999999,1189.6599999999999, Okay.
1189.6599999999999,1190.6599999999999, So back to your fish game pronounce Mario.
1190.6599999999999,1191.6599999999999, Okay.
1191.6599999999999,1192.6599999999999, Yeah.
1192.6599999999999,1194.82, So anyway long story short on that eventually you get to become a shark.
1194.82,1200.6599999999999," You get to come, uh, larger, more, uh, significant fish in the ecosystem."
1200.66,1201.66," Um, but it's cool."
1201.66,1205.8200000000002," Yeah, eventually do become a shark and you're eating great, uh, killer whales and"
1205.8200000000002,1209.66," everything from, from moving on up to like whatever clown fish type thing and a beef eating"
1209.66,1214.9," in a reef eating, uh, eating larger clown fish, trigger fish and whatnot."
1214.9,1216.5400000000002, So is this a pop cap?
1216.5400000000002,1217.5400000000002, It's not a pop cap.
1217.5400000000002,1218.5400000000002, I like that.
1218.5400000000002,1219.5400000000002, I had it.
1219.5400000000002,1221.8200000000002," I got it via steam, but it's also on the pop cap website."
1221.8200000000002,1223.5400000000002, And it's a good one to get.
1223.5400000000002,1226.22," I mean, like Melissa, she's, she's totally into it."
1226.22,1228.14," I mean, she's just, this was playing it all last night."
1228.14,1232.1000000000001, I woke up this morning talking about fish and so it's got all the signs of being
1232.1000000000001,1233.1000000000001, a clown fish.
1233.1000000000001,1234.1000000000001, Everybody needs games like that.
1234.1000000000001,1235.1000000000001," No, no."
1235.1000000000001,1236.1000000000001, Yeah.
1236.1000000000001,1237.1000000000001, I've been playing a lot of luminous live.
1237.1000000000001,1238.1000000000001," Um, it's box 360."
1238.1000000000001,1239.1000000000001, Despite the twitchy controls.
1239.1000000000001,1241.1000000000001, I'm okay with the controls.
1241.1000000000001,1244.0600000000002," The only thing that pisses me off is the, uh, you know, the song packs."
1244.0600000000002,1245.0600000000002, Yeah.
1245.0600000000002,1246.3400000000001, How many times have you bought it so far?
1246.3400000000001,1247.3400000000001, Just only once.
1247.3400000000001,1248.3400000000001, Okay.
1248.3400000000001,1249.3400000000001, Only once.
1249.3400000000001,1250.3400000000001, That's good.
1250.3400000000001,1251.3400000000001," Uh, sorry."
1251.3400000000001,1255.66, I feel like I let everyone down by would be playing more hardcore games.
1255.66,1256.66, Yeah.
1256.66,1260.9," I mean, need to get into flights him 10 unless it's X, whatever."
1260.9,1261.9, It's now.
1261.9,1263.9, And I don't know how you pronounce it.
1263.9,1264.9, It's still okay.
1264.9,1265.9, It's our site over.
1265.9,1267.26, So we'll hear more on that later.
1267.26,1268.9, Lights in X.
1268.9,1269.9, Extreme.
1269.9,1271.9," Uh, Mr. Milo, why, what do you plan?"
1271.9,1274.6200000000001," Uh, I was playing a whole lot of box pushing."
1274.6200000000001,1275.6200000000001," Uh, that's right."
1275.6200000000001,1276.6200000000001, You were moving.
1276.6200000000001,1277.6200000000001, I can't move.
1277.6200000000001,1279.22, So it's going to be not playing any computer games?
1279.22,1281.22, I had no computer to play anything on.
1281.22,1283.66," So technically, there's a world, a real world, Tetris."
1283.66,1285.22," Yeah, or boxle or show."
1285.22,1287.22, So it was a casual game.
1287.22,1290.22," Uh, the moving game sucked."
1290.22,1293.22, Did you didn't even play the wild trading card game?
1293.22,1296.74," No, we can play it really early and I got really mad about it."
1296.74,1297.74, You got mad about it.
1297.74,1298.74," Oh, you packed it."
1298.74,1302.9," Well, the mood like we had the movers come and these came six hours after they"
1302.9,1303.9, said.
1303.9,1306.26," So I was like, getting really restless and just forced to fall trading game."
1306.26,1307.26, Why did we pack that?
1307.26,1308.26, Damn it.
1308.26,1310.54, So I tried playing that with my kid.
1310.54,1312.7, And I got to say that manual sucks.
1312.7,1313.7, Yeah.
1313.7,1315.7, So I was playing the wild trading card game.
1315.7,1317.7," It was like, I don't know."
1317.7,1318.7, The same so easy.
1318.7,1319.7, And the producer was explaining it to me.
1319.7,1320.7, I know.
1320.7,1322.7," Well, when you have the guy who made the game sitting right there, walking you"
1322.7,1325.7," through the game, somehow it's pretty easy."
1325.7,1326.7, So I told you it's a little sad.
1326.7,1328.7, Like they walked me through this game.
1328.7,1329.7, This is going to be totally easy.
1329.7,1331.7, We took it all out and then I was sitting there going.
1331.7,1333.7, Eee.
1333.7,1335.7, So she was all frustrated with me.
1335.7,1336.7, Did you guys get a turtle mount?
1336.7,1337.7," No, we don't get a turtle mount."
1337.7,1341.7," Actually, I have to say part of the problem is that when I wasn't looking, she, like,"
1341.7,1342.7, opened up all the cards.
1342.7,1347.7," Like for the booster packs plus all the starter that cards, and she kind of mixed them all up."
1347.7,1348.7, So I blame her.
1348.7,1350.7," Yeah, my thumb daughters fall."
1350.7,1351.7, Not that you can't teacher.
1351.7,1354.7," And she blew the eBay value, man."
1354.7,1356.7," Yeah, totally."
1356.7,1357.7," No, but we didn't get a turtle mount."
1357.7,1358.7, I didn't get any loop cards at all.
1358.7,1359.7, People are still complaining.
1359.7,1362.7," Like two weeks after it's released, they can't find it anywhere."
1362.7,1364.7, Can't find what the user is.
1364.7,1365.7, That's a card game.
1365.7,1366.7, Yeah.
1366.7,1367.7, Yeah.
1367.7,1368.7, It's all sold out everywhere.
1368.7,1369.7, The man is high.
1369.7,1370.7, I'm sure.
1370.7,1371.7, Yeah.
1371.7,1372.7, It's great.
1372.7,1373.7, That's just like how they do things.
1373.7,1374.7, That's a garbage code.
1374.7,1375.7, It's limited cards.
1375.7,1378.7," Generates demand, and then off you go."
1378.7,1379.7, Right.
1379.7,1381.7, So speaking of wow.
1381.7,1384.7, So we talk about one of the big news items.
1384.7,1385.7, Yeah.
1385.7,1387.7, And now here's Darren with the news.
1387.7,1390.7, We're going to keep where he sort of likes our tab.
1390.7,1391.7, Everybody keep working.
1391.7,1392.7, This is channel one.
1392.7,1393.7, That was written with his.
1393.7,1394.7, He goes into classroom.
1394.7,1395.7," Yeah, channel one."
1395.7,1397.7," Mr. and Mr. America, all ships same."
1397.7,1398.7, Yeah.
1398.7,1399.7," No, no."
1399.7,1401.7, It's straight from wow.
1401.7,1402.7, Okay.
1402.7,1406.7, So actually this is the report saying that overrated the only US who are killed currently clearing
1406.7,1411.7, Blizzard's most recent raid dungeon in wow was banned in mass for wall hacking.
1411.7,1412.7, Okay.
1412.7,1413.7, Band completely.
1413.7,1414.7, Band completely from the world.
1414.7,1416.7," Well, now the guild was banned."
1416.7,1417.7, Yeah.
1417.7,1418.7, The guild is banned all the world.
1418.7,1419.7, Hang it.
1419.7,1420.7, Okay.
1420.7,1421.7," I mean, meaning the players can't."
1421.7,1422.7," Well, actually."
1422.7,1423.7," Well, he's basically they cleared all of."
1423.7,1425.7, And now you guys are going to correct me on this.
1425.7,1426.7, I'm sure.
1426.7,1427.7, Correct.
1427.7,1428.7, Yeah.
1428.7,1429.7, That's good.
1429.7,1430.7, Okay.
1430.7,1431.7, So they cleared all of that in the final 40 man dungeon.
1431.7,1432.7," Wow, but the hacks occurred in."
1432.7,1433.7, On Karaj.
1433.7,1434.7, Of course.
1434.7,1436.7, That's exactly what I was going to do.
1436.7,1437.7, Good.
1437.7,1438.7, Good.
1438.7,1439.7, Right.
1439.7,1440.7, Anyway.
1440.7,1441.7, So on the official.
1441.7,1442.7, Wow.
1442.7,1443.7, Forums.
1443.7,1444.7, And the.
1444.7,1446.7, An overrated member.
1446.7,1447.7, Panther.
1447.7,1448.7, Loons.
1448.7,1449.7, It says.
1449.7,1450.7, Awesome.
1450.7,1452.7, It says the following.
1452.7,1453.7, It's true.
1453.7,1454.7, A few minutes ago.
1454.7,1455.7, We went from having a near raid online to having seven.
1455.7,1456.7, A few minutes ago.
1456.7,1457.7, Ч〜
1457.7,1458.7, Worked up.
1458.7,1459.7, The third OR.
1459.7,1460.7, The second.
1460.7,1461.7, What do we think about the team.
1461.7,1462.7, How do we start following the tournament.
1462.7,1463.7, 4.
1463.7,1466.7, Declare up with pressure after the deathstrom and enjoy your swimming.
1466.7,1467.7, Are there any remaining evidence.
1467.7,1469.04," I part with an education or a winner terms or something, like that"
1469.04,1470.7, yet thể van der Weihann developing that among many once again.
1470.7,1471.7, Mhm.
1471.7,1472.7,�서 Kelly.
1472.7,1474.18," Because this is something very important, what to help them."
1474.18,1475.18, Yeah.
1475.18,1475.7, So probably.
1475.7,1477.7, 101warts.
1477.7,1478.7, 21st of Aてnez.
1478.7,1479.7, London.
1479.7,1480.7, A party like
1480.7,1481.7, costing.
1481.7,1482.4, 12 boxes
1482.4,1485.5, ablaid
1485.5,1489.5, all the little monsters in between the bosses are called trash mobs.
1489.5,1491.5, So it's just things you have to kill the
1491.5,1495.5, pretty good way to the mic. We get to the big guys to get to the guys that actually dropped the good loot.
1495.5,1501.5, So they want to get the mic and attach cards in the card game version of what we're going to play.
1501.5,1504.5, So it just takes a long time to have to slog through the garbage.
1504.5,1508.5, So basically the wall hacks were cutting off a couple of hours from these questions.
1508.5,1514.5, Right. Scram is the first boss in AQ 40 is what they call it on Karaj 40 man.
1514.5,1516.5, And a cut thun is the last boss.
1516.5,1520.5, And there's a 7 or so in between the two of them that you have to get through.
1520.5,1523.5, So they keep the wall hacks and they cheat it.
1523.5,1527.5, You know what I love by the way is the fact that Sean's breaking this down for me while we're having a
1527.5,1529.5, quest giver cap.
1529.5,1532.5," That's right. That's actually actually, actually,"
1532.5,1533.5," he's actually wearing a bit, you can't tell us what he's wearing."
1533.5,1535.5, I'm basically all cap of the big question mark on it.
1535.5,1538.5, Right. That means we solved the quest.
1538.5,1540.5, That's right. Or maybe we're ready for a new one.
1540.5,1541.5, I like the logic in this.
1541.5,1543.5, I want my reward by the way.
1543.5,1550.5, The guy's complaint is that this game is so freaking boring that they got a cheat to get done with it.
1550.5,1554.5," But instead of like, what happened to like just don't play it?"
1554.5,1556.5, They're making so bad.
1556.5,1559.5, We got a cheat just to not saying that it's broken.
1559.5,1563.5, That's just so the pre-gothon trash is painful.
1563.5,1565.5, It's one of those things that these are.
1565.5,1567.5, Why are you taking it out many times?
1567.5,1571.5," Yeah. That like it's just, it does get boring after a while."
1571.5,1574.5," And then you, there's skip it or you start cheating apparently."
1574.5,1577.5," You probably, at that point, you just want to not play it."
1577.5,1578.5," I mean, yeah."
1578.5,1583.5," So were they, were the players actually banned from while or was just the guild?"
1583.5,1585.5, Do we know the difference here?
1585.5,1586.5," I mean, it's like the guild."
1586.5,1588.5," I think the players, I think I can't log in or I think all the players."
1588.5,1589.5, You're bad.
1589.5,1590.5, I don't shit them.
1590.5,1591.5, I think all the players are bad.
1591.5,1592.5, I don't shit them.
1592.5,1593.5," I don't know much, much better."
1593.5,1594.5, I like it much better.
1594.5,1597.5," Pretty much like skipping all the way to Kuthan, like, get you some really good gear."
1597.5,1599.5, You really shouldn't have if you can't get your ass.
1599.5,1603.5," I think they try to appeal to Blizzard because, but I don't know what the, I mean,"
1603.5,1606.5," who knows what they're going to do, but something tells me they're different."
1606.5,1608.5, You think they should be banned?
1608.5,1609.5, Yeah.
1609.5,1610.5, Yeah.
1610.5,1611.5," I mean, it literally, like, we're wall hacking."
1611.5,1612.5, Yeah.
1612.5,1613.5," I think that's like, but it's not like, he's the pay."
1613.5,1615.5," I mean, they were just, I don't know."
1615.5,1616.5, Yeah.
1616.5,1617.5," But they didn't, so they didn't."
1617.5,1618.5, They didn't lose someone else's game.
1618.5,1622.5," Well, that's the thing is they, they could be ruining someone else's game with that gear."
1622.5,1623.5, Right.
1623.5,1624.5, How?
1624.5,1626.5, Was it a PVP start?
1626.5,1627.5," Like, right in people that way."
1627.5,1630.5," Like, that's, that's some pretty good PVP gear."
1630.5,1631.5, I think that's probably a little bit.
1631.5,1632.5, Yeah.
1632.5,1634.5," I mean, like, actually, he ignores, the bottom of the, other, rapid, rapid, rapid."
1634.5,1635.5, Yeah.
1635.5,1637.5, So he acknowledges at the bottom of the post.
1637.5,1638.5," And he was, yeah, yeah, whatever."
1638.5,1639.5, We know we deserve it.
1639.5,1642.5," He, he, he, he, he just, like, hoping to get his, his case appeal somehow."
1642.5,1645.5," But, the meantime, he understood that, you know, he kind of saw the consequences."
1645.5,1646.34, This comes as common.
1646.34,1649.74, Blizzard does not like the cheaters or the gold farmers.
1649.74,1651.46, You gotta kind of know that at this point.
1651.46,1652.1, They have cheating.
1652.1,1654.54," Not been shy, but I don't think it's just make them run the"
1654.54,1657.22, pre-kit on trash like 50 times as a punishment.
1657.22,1658.34," Yeah, you can break it on the,"
1658.34,1659.34, they get naked.
1659.34,1660.34, Yeah.
1660.34,1662.86, Or maybe just make them run through stormwind naked or something.
1662.86,1664.62, Or nerf from down to like level 30 or something.
1664.62,1667.06," They don't, they don't need that gold."
1667.06,1668.06, Blizzard.
1668.06,1669.62," Yeah, they got enough people."
1669.62,1672.26, Good to do without a overrated or whatever.
1672.26,1673.62," Yeah, they're probably not losing it."
1673.62,1674.62, They're not playing that.
1674.62,1675.62, They're not playing that.
1675.62,1676.62, They're not playing that.
1676.62,1677.62, Because they know they're such fiends anyway.
1677.62,1679.62, They're just going to go buy new accounts.
1679.62,1683.4599999999998, When they got through next ramus like before or after they'd
1683.4599999999998,1684.4599999999998, started cheating.
1684.4599999999998,1685.6999999999998," Yeah, that was a really count."
1685.6999999999998,1686.6999999999998, And then.
1686.6999999999998,1689.2199999999998," And by the way, if you're one of the five people,"
1689.2199999999998,1692.62," me included who don't know what the hell next ramus is, go to the"
1692.62,1696.1799999999998," WoW and Cyclopedia, which just launched on the on the WoW site."
1696.1799999999998,1699.1, So go to worldenworkcraft.com and somewhere on there's a whole
1699.1,1701.62, lately launched on the Cyclopas are paying you for that plug there.
1701.62,1702.62, Yeah.
1702.62,1704.62," Okay, as I'm a horn to sell out."
1704.62,1707.62, I think my life is Richard not knowing what next ramus is.
1707.62,1712.62," Yeah, it says like a feeding frenzy guy."
1712.62,1714.62," There's real world knowledge in that game, right?"
1714.62,1715.62, It was like a Chicago show.
1715.62,1716.62, I learned about that.
1716.62,1719.62," It was a real life, psychoshike, the corolli."
1719.62,1720.62," Tiger shi-a-k, the corolli."
1720.62,1721.62, KG-sieck.
1721.62,1722.62, Yeah.
1722.62,1724.62, So what is your ramus ready on?
1724.62,1725.62, Thank you.
1725.62,1726.62," Thank you, Mr. Shons."
1726.62,1729.02," Yeah, that's what I don't get that about the about the wow and"
1729.02,1730.62, Psychopedia that there's already wicked media.
1730.62,1731.62, Right.
1731.62,1733.62, So blizzers even a wow wiki.
1733.62,1734.62, Yeah.
1734.62,1735.62, Why did they have to do that?
1735.62,1736.62, I don't know.
1736.62,1738.62, They got too much money of her blizzard.
1738.62,1739.62, They don't know what to do with it.
1739.62,1741.62, They want to make it a psychopathia.
1741.62,1743.62, But they have all the stuff lying around anyway.
1743.62,1746.62," Guys, I have an idea if we produce our own"
1746.62,1748.62," No Wikipedia related to World of Warcraft,"
1748.62,1751.62, maybe blizzard grew by us at some point or higher us.
1751.62,1755.62, I think that's probably the conversation that
1755.62,1756.62, Beget.
1756.62,1758.62," Yeah, but this isn't, I thought this was a blizzard thing."
1758.62,1760.62, It's all internal.
1760.62,1761.62, My bad.
1761.62,1762.62, That's the only reason I brought up.
1762.62,1764.62, I have no idea what the hell have the stuff.
1764.62,1765.62, You guys talk about the high levels.
1765.62,1767.62," Well, now you know, you know, a little more."
1767.62,1768.62, I need every night.
1768.62,1769.62, I know he's half the battle.
1769.62,1771.62," If you do want to know what next ramus is, just ask."
1771.62,1772.62, Just ask Shons.
1772.62,1774.62, He'll be glad to invite you.
1774.62,1776.62, How many minutes do he have left?
1776.62,1777.62, I think it's time to reture him.
1777.62,1778.62, Damn it.
1778.62,1779.62, Damn it.
1779.62,1780.62, I hate them.
1780.62,1781.62, Shit.
1781.62,1784.62, I like with so much easier before retre not.
1784.62,1787.62, So we can talk about all that Diablo 3 stuff that we had planned for
1787.62,1788.62, today next week.
1788.62,1789.62, All right.
1789.62,1790.62, All right.
1790.62,1791.62, All right.
1791.62,1793.62, We have a Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2.
1793.62,1794.62, Yeah.
1794.62,1796.62, We can't do it five minutes right now.
1796.62,1797.62, No.
1797.62,1798.62, We don't have time.
1798.62,1801.62, The stew back because we had pretty much the full scoop on both games.
1801.62,1802.62, Yeah.
1802.62,1803.62, We're going to talk about our next three.
1803.62,1804.62," Oh, well."
1804.62,1806.62," Well, if it wasn't for retre not, so you don't know."
1806.62,1807.62, She could be here.
1807.62,1809.62, We're just kidding.
1809.62,1810.62, We know nothing about either game.
1810.62,1813.62, I can't be mad at us and don't be mad at retre not.
1813.62,1814.62, You'd be mad at blizzard.
1814.62,1815.62, Really?
1815.62,1816.62, That's what it all comes out.
1816.62,1821.62, So what else could we talk about in ten minutes?
1821.62,1823.62, You got in your little scoop report there.
1823.62,1824.62, All right.
1824.62,1825.62, Somebody else burped.
1825.62,1827.62, What is it with the gas on the show today?
1827.62,1828.62, Drink it a lot of coax and stuff before.
1828.62,1829.62, Yeah.
1829.62,1830.62, I need to get some more fluids beforehand.
1830.62,1831.62, Look.
1831.62,1835.62, Look at this one valve and braces multi core process.
1835.62,1836.62, Come on.
1836.62,1837.62, Okay.
1837.62,1838.62, Don't keep it there.
1838.62,1839.62, It doesn't sound exciting.
1839.62,1841.62, But there is actually some cool stuff that could happen out of this.
1841.62,1843.62, I'll skip all the technical BF.
1843.62,1848.62," But the short version is you're going to have, okay, with multiple cores."
1848.62,1851.62, Obviously there's a lot of different ways it could happen.
1851.62,1853.62, You'd be explained what multiple cores are for those.
1853.62,1854.62, Okay.
1854.62,1855.62, Not basically.
1855.62,1856.62," You know, okay."
1856.62,1859.62," So you might have heard the term like, you know, dual core or stuff like that."
1859.62,1863.62, Two CPUs working together kind of like how graphics cards work and slot in SLI or
1863.62,1864.62, Crossfire.
1864.62,1867.62, So it's getting up to the point now with Kent's field.
1867.62,1868.62, It's the new chip set for Intel.
1868.62,1870.62, You can use four CPUs.
1870.62,1873.62," It's kind of like the Razors, you know."
1873.62,1874.62, Yeah.
1874.62,1875.62, And they got like five blades.
1875.62,1878.62, We have four processors now.
1878.62,1883.62, Like the fusion set are five blades and then there's like a back blade for like edging your like sideburn.
1883.62,1886.62, How many frickin times you have to put a blade in your back right now.
1886.62,1887.62, There's like they also bite.
1887.62,1888.62," Oh, yeah."
1888.62,1890.62, Five blades at vibrate exactly.
1890.62,1891.62, Wasn't one good enough.
1891.62,1892.62, So sorry.
1892.62,1893.62, Sorry.
1893.62,1895.62, So like the sign folder routine.
1895.62,1896.62, I'll just have to try.
1896.62,1898.62, What's the deal with the four blades?
1898.62,1900.62," Well, these people wasn't one good enough."
1900.62,1901.62, All right.
1901.62,1902.62, So that's okay.
1902.62,1906.62, So basically I'm going to skip all the tech BS but the short version is in a demo at
1906.62,1910.62," Valve recently they showed people an extreme tech, always technical bunch of guys."
1910.62,1912.62, How they had two demos.
1912.62,1918.62," One was on a machine running for four CPUs, four cores, two gigs of RAM."
1918.62,1923.62, And basically you would have like 500 of the ant lions running around on screen at the same time.
1923.62,1924.62," Oh, these were ants."
1924.62,1925.62," Oh, ants."
1925.62,1926.62, That's right.
1926.62,1927.62, Okay.
1927.62,1928.62," So they had, okay, 500 critters."
1928.62,1929.62, It's called critters if you love them.
1929.62,1930.62, So they're running around.
1930.62,1931.62, Not a lie.
1931.62,1932.62," Oh, my."
1932.62,1935.62, I'm going to talk about I make fun of.
1935.62,1937.62, Vamped in trash.
1937.62,1938.62," Well, Darren."
1938.62,1941.62, There's a significant difference between the ant and an ant lion.
1941.62,1942.62, An ant lion.
1942.62,1944.62, And just the lion.
1944.62,1945.62, Okay.
1945.62,1946.62, But now that we cleared that.
1946.62,1947.62, That we could do that.
1947.62,1950.62," So basically 500 of these things running around reacting to the environment,"
1950.62,1952.62, intelligently at the same time.
1952.62,1954.62, And a similar test on.
1955.62,1959.62," I mean, you see a single core 3.2 gigahertz penny before they can only manage 100."
1959.62,1960.62, It's at once.
1960.62,1963.62," So I mean, it's getting a net gain of 400 ant."
1963.62,1964.62, Yes.
1964.62,1965.62, 400 ants.
1965.62,1966.62, That in a game.
1966.62,1968.62, The really interesting part of the story.
1968.62,1969.62, You pick that right there.
1969.62,1973.62," It's because like a year ago in our, in our, not our last valve cover story, but the one prior to that."
1973.62,1974.62, Uh-huh.
1974.62,1980.62," Gabe Newell actually said, you know, among his things that we're not making his life any easier is a developer."
1980.62,1982.62, We're multi core process.
1982.62,1986.62, And so now this is interesting because it's a turn about for the company.
1986.62,1989.62," And they're embracing it and saying, well, hey, actually we got a grip on this now."
1989.62,1992.62, We think we're two years ahead of everyone else and getting a grip on it.
1992.62,1994.62, And we could do a lot of neat stuff with it.
1994.62,1997.62, So they're going to have more ants per game than other game comes.
1997.62,1998.62, That's right.
1998.62,2001.62," So no, but I mean, what's, it sounds like we come with this lighter maybe."
2001.62,2006.62," Is just as we got the lost coast level, which was, which was more or less a demo for the HDR."
2006.62,2011.62," Yeah, for people that had high resistance, their uses with multi core processors will likely get."
2011.62,2015.62, Access to a new level created just to show off what that hardware could do.
2015.62,2016.62, Exactly.
2016.62,2022.62," And the cool part is, I mean, the fact is it's the source engine that can literally flip a switch and just kind of where have that work into all the other stuff."
2022.62,2024.62, So they can add other features in.
2024.62,2025.62, Right.
2025.62,2026.62, And they go back and put it into.
2026.62,2032.62," So I think what that would do, if they went back and they, they sort of put multi core support in like half like two."
2032.62,2040.62," What I think most obviously, it would be more intelligent AI because you're able to have multiple AI tasks spread across the different."
2040.62,2041.62, CPUs.
2041.62,2046.62," You know, that are just have like serious Sam caliber levels of like head crab is jumping at you from every angle."
2046.62,2047.62, Right.
2047.62,2048.62, That's freaking nuts.
2048.62,2055.62," And interestingly, it'd be interesting to see what's going on with it, but they're saying that, you know, they're also spread physics calculations across the CPU."
2055.62,2061.62," So I wonder wonder if, if kind of the whole physics card thing that's going to turn out that it wasn't necessary after all."
2061.62,2062.62," Well, that's what it does."
2062.62,2069.62," Well, that's kind of what the, that was an ongoing, you know, that like, like 80, 80, I was looking to address with their latest crossfire cards."
2069.62,2074.62, Because they had so much computing power that they were saying it could do physics calculations as well as graphics.
2074.62,2075.62, Right.
2075.62,2076.62, So it's a sign here.
2076.62,2077.62, It's already passing out.
2077.62,2078.62, Honestly.
2078.62,2079.62, Yeah.
2079.62,2080.62," But I mean, yeah, I don't want to eat."
2080.62,2082.62, No physics and guild wars.
2082.62,2084.62, The only physics is Ryan's death.
2084.62,2085.62, And there's no red guy.
2085.62,2086.62, I got it.
2086.62,2088.62, I got a little problem with it.
2088.62,2090.62," I mean, I'm sure this is great news."
2090.62,2093.62," But the reason it's, I'm feeling a little sour about this."
2093.62,2095.62, Forced upgrades.
2095.62,2096.62, Yeah.
2096.62,2101.62," It's like right now, these games keep coming out right now that are already like taxing all our current systems."
2101.62,2106.62," You know, it's like we're already in a force upgrades thing with, with this current round of stuff."
2106.62,2108.62," You know, it would current round the games."
2108.62,2113.62," And that's why I tell everybody, I mean, some people just came by earlier because they're looking to buy a new computer."
2113.62,2117.62," They're looking forward to playing some stuff for the holidays, whenever I said don't buy a new computer."
2117.62,2118.62, Wait.
2118.62,2120.62, Also think of how long it took that.
2120.62,2125.62, I think it once once a developer like that does establish some sort of proprietary technology that they're going to use.
2125.62,2126.62, Going forward.
2126.62,2127.62, Yeah.
2127.62,2133.62," I mean, look at like when they first started showing off half life too when we finally got it by the time that it came out our computers were ready for it."
2133.62,2135.62, That's true for the most part.
2135.62,2136.62, Yeah.
2136.62,2138.62," So I mean, this isn't stuff that's just going to start happening tomorrow."
2138.62,2142.62, And that's what we need to go out along with direct X10 and visit by yourself.
2142.62,2144.62," I mean, I mean, a lot of processor."
2144.62,2146.62, The merciful part is that it's being slowly leaked.
2146.62,2149.62," You know, trickled out as opposed to like upgrade now."
2149.62,2150.62, Right.
2150.62,2151.62, That's the part that I appreciate.
2151.62,2154.62, Because there we either will be years when it's still split all up again.
2154.62,2155.62," And that I mean, that could be complicated."
2155.62,2157.62," You know, I mean, just for other developers too."
2157.62,2163.62," I mean, when you've got half of your audience or one third of your audience, it's got dual core part of multi, you know, more than more than."
2163.62,2165.62, We definitely can like a crossroads right now.
2165.62,2166.62, It definitely feels away.
2166.62,2171.62," I mean, you know, we keep running into problems with all the new releases now of performance issues."
2171.62,2180.62," And I'm really feeling like, wow, this machine that I thought like a year ago was cutting edge is suddenly, I think about to expire."
2180.62,2181.62, I think I got it.
2181.62,2183.62, I'm thinking I keep thinking with every new game.
2183.62,2188.62," Oh, I guess I have to add a giga ram or I have to get a new processor or I need another graphics card."
2188.62,2191.62," Some of the games that I did though, Dartmouth's I is definitely the game."
2191.62,2198.62," I'm willing to bet that with never win or nights, all the problems you're having are not because like in adequate hardware."
2198.62,2200.62," Yeah, because the way that it is put together."
2200.62,2207.62," And don't forget really briefly when when company heroes first came out, there's a problem with any graphic, any slide card use those like, yeah, yeah."
2207.62,2209.62," There was a quick, I mean, that was created."
2209.62,2211.62, That was solved in like a matter of days and the game.
2211.62,2212.62, Right.
2212.62,2217.62," But in that case, it was the opposite was like the the harder core hardware actually performed poorly."
2217.62,2218.62, But it just had a bug.
2218.62,2219.62, Right.
2219.62,2220.62, The point is you're kind of coding to something.
2220.62,2222.62," It's kind of like that, you know, newer technologies."
2222.62,2224.62, So it's kind of creating issues.
2224.62,2227.62, That's going to be the same way with multi core CPUs and stuff like that.
2227.62,2228.62," Actually, it does."
2228.62,2229.62, Right.
2229.62,2230.62, Yeah.
2230.62,2231.62, Yeah.
2231.62,2233.62, Hopefully bad timing too because this is like the new console season.
2233.62,2237.62, So like this is the kind of thing that pisses people off enough that are like screw PCs.
2237.62,2238.62, I'm not going to buy it.
2238.62,2239.62, Right.
2239.62,2248.62," And that's the problem is that like, I mean, if if this to rolled out when they were hoping to like around this time of year, then you would have had DX 10 out there and you would have had like all these things that are addressing all these issues people are having right now."
2248.62,2252.62," But here you have the hardware out on its proper time table, but the software isn't ready yet."
2252.62,2259.62," So that's why when you buy a new PC, I think starting now or at least around Thanksgiving time, they're giving away slips in the box saying,"
2259.62,2262.62," You can get a, a, a, a, a VISTA upgrade."
2262.62,2263.62, A VISTA upgrade.
2263.62,2264.62, Yeah.
2264.62,2266.62, I think I'm just going to wait for VISTA and that's yeah.
2266.62,2267.62, I'm hanging there as long as you can.
2267.62,2268.62, I'm excited about the.
2268.62,2269.62, Yeah.
2269.62,2271.62, The retro nuts are about to break in like the cool aid man.
2271.62,2273.62, So we have a round of stuff.
2273.62,2278.62," I said, one of these weeks, man, there's just going to be an on air rumble between us and"
2278.62,2279.62, Ratchanauts.
2279.62,2281.62," I think we can take, we can take them."
2281.62,2284.62," But, uh, a bunch of little skinny."
2284.62,2285.62, Take them all my own.
2285.62,2286.62, Yeah.
2286.62,2287.62, No kid.

2289.62,2290.62, Fine.
2290.62,2291.62, Yeah.

2298.62,2299.62, I'm really kidding.
2299.62,2304.62," Please don't make fun of, don't give them crap online because somebody did that last"
2304.62,2306.62, time when I was joking.
2306.62,2307.62, Great.
2307.62,2308.62, And that was that serious.
2308.62,2309.62, And that wasn't good.
