115.56,116.56, 10.
116.56,118.56, And a 9.5.
118.56,120.56, 9.30 to 40 grand cops up to speed.
120.56,126.56, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio.
126.56,129.56, This is the podcast for December 4th.
129.56,133.56, 2007 we are going to be rushing through this one sadly.
133.56,136.56, Unfortunately because we're on one of those.
136.56,140.56, God awful horrible schedules were like 800 people need the room.
140.56,143.56, So apologies in advance.
143.56,147.56, Fortunately there's nothing to talk about this week since really nothing happened.
147.56,148.56, Right?
148.56,150.56, Nothing at all.
150.56,153.56, The business is usual here in the games industry.
153.56,159.56, This is Jeff Green and I'm here with the other gang of rest of the gang from GFW.
159.56,161.56, Which includes Ryan Scott.
161.56,163.56, Sean Maloy and Sean Elliott.
163.56,173.56," And Dern Gladstone is in fact alive and well he's very very busy with lots of text stuff these days, but he is alive and he says hi."
173.56,182.56, So we're all kind of living in a sort of a post-Gurseman world now.
182.56,192.56, And I'm not sure where to begin on that thing or even how we want to approach it because we don't prepare for this podcast.
192.56,194.56, Take mental notes.
194.56,203.56, But I do want to say first of all we are going to talk about this issue because really there's it's hard to not talk about this issue.
203.56,211.56, But I am going to issue the standard disclaimer which is very necessary that we don't know anything more here.
211.56,230.56, About what went down with the game spots firing of Jeff Gersman other than what all of you listening know from various new stories and blogs and foreign messages all of which involve a lot of speculation.
230.56,240.56," So some of what we're talking about is just us being kind of righteous blowhards without any real information, but that doesn't mean we can't be righteous blowhards."
240.56,244.56, But if you do that's our right springboard to talk about the industry.
244.56,245.56, It definitely is.
245.56,246.56, It definitely is.
246.56,248.56, It definitely is.
248.56,249.56, It definitely is.
249.56,252.56, It's the way that we interface with publishers and developers and our editorial team and our marketing teams and all these things.
252.56,257.56, And by talking around it and it's sort of about that and the state of the industry.
257.56,264.56, I think it does make sense and it will show and I believe once we do talk about it it will it will show you to some extent why.
264.56,270.56, It's plausible to take the speculation and put the connected dots in the way that people are connecting them.
270.56,276.56, Right. Why it's a possible move for people to make not why it's possible that this is actually that you know.
276.56,280.56," Yeah, I'm tripping over myself basically we know you mean that it's not very."
280.56,281.56, It's not very.
281.56,282.56, It's not very.
282.56,283.56, It's not very.
283.56,284.56, It's not very.
284.56,285.56, It's not very.
285.56,286.56, It's not very.
286.56,293.56," The fact that that it is very, very believable in is in of itself is very telling and said the fact that a story like this could come."
293.56,299.56, And we all are sort of assuming it's probably true or aspects of an or true.
299.56,303.56, This should never be the case in journalism.
303.56,305.56, This should just the this this.
305.56,308.56, Rumors shouldn't even have happened.
308.56,313.56, You know the fact that it did is why the story so big and why it's not going away for a lot of us.
313.56,314.56," I mean, I'm sure."
314.56,318.56, Seeing it and games bought and I'd also are hoping it just goes away now.
318.56,320.56, But I think for a lot of us.
320.56,325.56, It's not really going to because it raises some huge huge questions.
325.56,329.56, If you're listening and you don't know what happened.
329.56,330.56, The.
330.56,335.56, The things we do know are that Jeff Gersman is the editorial director.
335.56,337.56, I think it was his title at Gamespot.
337.56,340.56, He'd been there for 11 years.
340.56,343.56, And he was fired from.
343.56,347.56, From Gamespot and from what I understand from the stories we've read anyway.
347.56,349.56, He was so merely fired.
349.56,352.56, Meaning he showed up at work and found out he was fired.
352.56,353.56, Right.
353.56,354.56, Exactly.
354.56,355.56, This is what we know.
355.56,358.56, We also know that around the same time.
358.56,360.56, Gamespot had a.
360.56,366.56, Massive advertising campaign going on on their website on the front door of their site.
366.56,368.56, For the game came and went from I.
368.56,378.56, And we also know that Gersman had written a largely unfavorable review and had filmed a video review of the same game.
378.56,382.56, Both were were fairly negative.
382.56,385.56, And then the video review was taken down.
385.56,386.56, Right.
386.56,389.56, So all in all in the same sequence of events.
389.56,391.56, Mr. Gersman lost his job.
391.56,393.56, The video review was pulled down.
393.56,396.56, The print review received some edits.
396.56,401.56, And then that started there after the ad got removed from Gamespot.
401.56,402.56, Right.
402.56,411.56, And then we started seeing some blog posts from the Gamespot editor themselves referring to the incident and a couple websites.
411.56,416.56, Kotaku and Joysticks started picking up some comments and a valley wag.
416.56,423.56, A Silicon Valley kind of gossip site started getting anonymous.
423.56,426.56," And then they started saying,"
426.56,431.56, I think it's a good idea.
431.56,445.56," So, you know, one thing is that all of us here know all of us in the summer that the game publishers aren't happy when they get negative reviews."
445.56,448.56, This happens all the time.
448.56,452.56," They will get cranky to the point of calling our bosses and saying,"
452.56,456.56," We're going to pull our ads if you don't, you know,"
456.56,460.56," If since you don't like our games apparently, we don't need to advertise with you."
460.56,461.56, This happens all the time.
461.56,465.56," And again, you know, we can't prove it."
465.56,467.56, We don't know what really happened.
467.56,468.56, This is what I was saying.
468.56,477.56, It's not entirely unrealistic because that we know that publishers exercise a great deal of pressure on writers for magazines and websites.
477.56,481.56, And that they're all these pressures to give games high scores.
481.56,483.56," So, they might be indirect."
483.56,486.56," I mean, there's there's that where in most cases,"
486.56,490.56," People on the editorial side of the firewall shouldn't hear about this, right?"
490.56,492.56," I mean, they will go to the advertising departments."
492.56,494.56," But every time we talk about it and we say,"
494.56,495.56, We know it exists.
495.56,497.56," Like I've heard other people say, Oh, we know it exists,"
497.56,498.56, But it's never happened to us.
498.56,502.56," Like, well, I don't believe that because you got to know it exists somehow."
502.56,503.56, Right.
503.56,505.56," Once in a while, a whisper will slip through the firewall,"
505.56,509.56," And you'll be made aware of the fact that, Oh, someone's punishing us."
509.56,510.56," You know, actually, that's true."
510.56,514.56," I can definitely tell you that there's times where it will filter down to me,"
514.56,516.56," Say, as editor and chief of this magazine,"
516.56,521.56," that some advertiser got annoyed about something we wrote in the magazine,"
521.56,523.56, And it went down the chain.
523.56,524.56, And it gets to me.
524.56,527.56, But then even getting to me is unusual.
527.56,528.56, Right.
528.56,532.56," But when it gets to me, like, I won't often tell one of you because that's,"
532.56,534.56, It's just an unfair pressure that I should say.
534.56,536.56, You should never have to think about that.
536.56,539.56," And I mean, I think that that's, I want to hit that sub-later,"
539.56,543.56," But I think a lot of times if you look very closely at reviews and stuff,"
543.56,545.56," I will, you know, at least in my mind,"
545.56,549.56," I will think that I see people writing for publishers to some extent,"
549.56,552.56," or writing with an awareness of the publisher,"
552.56,555.56, rather than writing just for their audience.
555.56,558.56," You know, they'll do certain things that I think are indicative of that."
558.56,561.56," But so in addition to that side,"
562.56,564.56," we have, I mean, and there, well, let's talk about,"
564.56,568.56, for a possible solution there in the dream world is for magazines and websites
568.56,571.56, to have what are known as non-indemic ads.
571.56,572.56, Right.
572.56,575.56," And that means that we're not, they're not advertisements for the products"
575.56,577.56, that we cover in our editorial.
577.56,578.56, Right.
578.56,580.56," So in other words, mountain do, we don't write about mountain do."
580.56,581.56," You know, that's fine."
581.56,584.56, The mountain do is not going to get pissed off and say they're not going to support us
584.56,586.56," because we said that their new latest drink,"
586.56,588.56, it talk about taste like crap.
588.56,589.56, Right.
589.56,593.56," And this is totally my dream scenario that the game press,"
593.56,597.56," that the gaming media all across the board for all of us,"
597.56,601.56, that we can get away from being reliant on the very people we write about
601.56,605.56, to support us with advertising.
605.56,608.56," You know, it doesn't happen in any other media right now."
608.56,611.56," And it's one of the reasons why, quote unquote,"
611.56,615.56, games journals in such an infantile state.
615.56,618.56," You know, I was saying before we went on the air,"
618.56,622.56," you know, it's as if TV shows were, you know,"
622.56,625.56," had product placement that was then, you know, that was Curtis,"
625.56,627.56, when not product placement.
627.56,631.56," Like let's say, let's say you're watching according to Jim"
631.56,635.56," and Jim Belushi says, like, man, this guy Pepsi tastes like urine."
635.56,639.56," And the guys who make a die Pepsi who bought an ad are going,"
639.56,640.56, what the fuck?
640.56,641.56, Fuck you.
641.56,644.56, Why Jim Belushi saying die Pepsi tastes like piss.
644.56,645.56, And it's okay.
645.56,646.56, We're pulling our ads.
646.56,647.56, Fuck you.
647.56,650.56," Because the review will appear on the very same, you know,"
650.56,652.56, opposite page of an advertisement.
652.56,653.56, It would be like booze.
653.56,656.56, She's saying that and then it cutting immediately to a commercial
656.56,658.56, break and then it being die Pepsi.
658.56,659.56, Right.
659.56,663.56," So Pepsi can just take their, you know, their urine flavor"
663.56,665.56, drink and go home.
665.56,671.56," So, you know, what we need here is a magazine and a website,"
671.56,674.56," like games, Potter think full of like automobile ads"
674.56,676.56, and so to ads and potato chip ads.
677.56,679.56, Where you can make fun of me.
679.56,680.56, Make good.
680.56,686.56, Where you can write a six out of 10 review and not get fired for it.
686.56,687.56, Yeah.
687.56,690.56," People left it in my griddle thing, but that is the root to honesty."
690.56,693.56," Honestly, don't look at the griddle in the mouth."
693.56,694.56, Yeah.
694.56,701.56, And that would go a long way to solving that part of the problem.
701.56,704.56, I don't believe that is the solution though.
704.56,709.56," Because the difference is if say the show, you know,"
709.56,712.56," say what is this, I haven't ever watched it recording the gyms."
712.56,713.56, I what you called it.
713.56,715.56, I haven't watched it here in a while.
715.56,717.56, So say what is it for the first time?
717.56,720.56," It is for the right, the scripts for recording the gym."
720.56,722.56, They needed the help of Pepsi company.
722.56,723.56, Mm-hmm.
723.56,727.56," And this is the circumstances that the circumstance that we're in, you know,"
727.56,731.56, because say if we even want to write something that's not a preview or
731.56,734.56," that's not not a review, you know, we can ultimately"
734.56,736.56, we can write reviews free of their assistance.
736.56,737.56, We can go to the store and buy them.
737.56,739.56," So that means, but that's there's another pressure there."
739.56,740.56, And that's to be timely.
740.56,744.56," And to be timely and to be sooner, you have to get the code in advance"
744.56,746.56, from the developer and the publisher.
746.56,750.56," If they're pissed off at you, they're not going to want to give it to you in advance."
750.56,753.56," If you're going to write, let's go beyond the preview and say,"
753.56,755.56, we're going to just story like now.
755.56,758.56," You know, in our next issue, we're looking at all these reasons"
759.56,763.56," to what games are delayed, some classic cases of games have been delayed."
763.56,768.56," And so if we want to talk about, you know, these case studies,"
768.56,769.56," you know, what happens?"
769.56,772.56," Getting, getting all, paying a broad picture by talking to all these individuals"
772.56,775.56," and seeing what in particular went wrong or what happened,"
775.56,777.56," what, what's called their development process."
777.56,781.56," Well, if one of those companies that made one of those games is upset with you"
781.56,785.56, because you gave a score that they weren't happy with one of their games
785.56,787.56," or the publisher, maybe the developer does fine."
787.56,790.56, But the publisher's not happy.
790.56,792.56, You will not have access to those people.
792.56,795.56," Right. So again, that's limiting your information."
795.56,798.56," And almost every story that you could possibly write for one of these,"
798.56,800.56," you know, for one of our sites or magazines,"
800.56,805.56, at some point is going to need some source or some sort of contact.
805.56,807.56," And well, that's another step for this."
807.56,810.56," Practice though, yes, from advertising."
810.56,812.56," It's another issue, yes."
812.56,816.56," But I kind of, but I just want to look at like to, to make it in the broad sense,"
816.56,819.56, all these pressures for doing positive things.
819.56,820.56, But so that is still a pressure.
820.56,823.56," If you know, if we give this game this score,"
823.56,825.56," the score that we truly believe it deserves,"
825.56,830.56," right, we know that we risk not getting information."
830.56,834.56, We not getting the next cover story based on the game that the developer makes.
834.56,836.56, Another game by the same publisher.
836.56,837.56, Right.
837.56,838.56, Any follow-up stuff?
838.56,841.56," And you know, after thoughts sorts of interviews, stories like the kind of"
841.56,842.56, I'm talking about.
842.56,843.56," So all these are there, too."
843.56,844.56, Right.
844.56,847.56," But they need that our gants, the hell gate London,"
847.56,852.56, to cover story are probably severely diminished at this point.
852.56,853.56, Right.
853.56,855.56, I would say they're probably slim to none.
855.56,856.56, Right.
856.56,860.56," And that's, and of course, this, it's not the publishers,"
860.56,863.56," you know, it's not our right to demand any of this information."
863.56,864.56, Of course.
864.56,865.56, Of course.
865.56,867.56," To think, this is all private, you know, I mean, they're making, they're making entertainment to sell."
867.56,868.56, These are businesses.
868.56,870.56, They don't know anyone anything.
870.56,872.56, They don't need to let you go to their events.
872.56,875.56," They don't need to be in shots, and they don't want, you need to speak to the people who make the games."
875.56,879.56, And they do it because it's in their interest to get the word out.
879.56,883.56," But if the word that you're getting out is negative or if they think that when they're review comes,"
883.56,884.56, it's going to be negative.
884.56,885.56, Then they can pull it.
885.56,887.56, And so that's the thing that makes me wonder.
887.56,893.56," I mean, is it even to the extent where we need to separate magazines and sites that do editorial stuff from those that do reviews?"
893.56,896.56, Do you have to like keep the two apart in general?
896.56,898.56, Because it's always on the reviews where you get slammed.
898.56,899.56, Right.
899.56,900.56, So you keep those things separate.
900.56,903.56, Then then we are just a wing of their PR department.
903.56,904.56," Not necessarily, though."
904.56,905.56, You can write critical previews.
905.56,907.56, I'm a firm believer in that.
907.56,910.56, And all the sorts of stories that I'm talking about.
910.56,914.56, But the critical preview is that it's critical is going to have the same negative impact.
914.56,915.56, That's true.
915.56,916.56, You know.
916.56,917.56, So the other story.
917.56,919.56, What if it was entirely feature based?
919.56,920.56, Right.
920.56,923.56," And it was automatic, like I say, you know, you're looking at various trends in 2008."
923.56,925.56," I mean, 2007 game making and all these things."
925.56,927.56, And you do need to talk to the developers.
927.56,932.56," You want to look at how a studio functions and how it works, you know, how differs from"
932.56,933.56, others.
933.56,934.56," I mean, that's totally different."
934.56,935.56," I mean, that's totally different."
935.56,936.56, Saying that.
936.56,937.56, And say what?
937.56,938.56, There are places that do that.
938.56,939.56," Like, like, like, gummissure trends."
939.56,940.56, Right.
940.56,941.56, Right.
941.56,942.56, That's true.
942.56,943.56, Yeah.
943.56,945.56," But I mean, look at something even like entertainment weekly."
945.56,947.56," I mean, this is a magazine comes out every week."
947.56,952.56," And they have totally insider, he suck up the interviews with people."
952.56,954.56, And they have glowing previews or whatever.
954.56,960.56," But then in the same issue, they'll give Fs to major movies or D's or to major CDs."
960.56,966.56," You know, so obviously, in that case, the machine reads in place where they are able to take"
966.56,975.56, these very critical stances and still operate with or work with the same companies to get insider information.
975.56,977.56," You know, I mean, what's a difference."
977.56,978.56, How come it doesn't exist?
978.56,981.56," I don't know if maybe, I mean, maybe we're not aware of maybe the our cases where this"
981.56,989.56, grows holding and stuff and they're covers that get changed in the last minute because one company is more eager to work with you than another.
989.56,992.56, Or maybe sometimes there is a bit of a fallout.
992.56,996.56, And that cover story runs in the same issue as a negative review.
996.56,997.56, Right.
997.56,1002.56," I mean, it also probably is that, you know, entertainment weekly is owned by what is it a time Warner."
1002.56,1006.56," So really, the advertising is happening way, way, way up the food chain."
1006.56,1007.56, Right.
1007.56,1008.56, And it is on the dynamic.
1008.56,1010.56," I mean, there's, I mean, that is there."
1010.56,1013.56," I mean, that's the point you're making is that that's a huge help."
1013.56,1014.56, And I think that I agree.
1014.56,1018.56, That's an absolutely important place to get to.
1018.56,1020.56, But I just don't think it solves everything.
1020.56,1021.56, I think you have to deal with that pressure.
1021.56,1027.56," And I think this is why I like to talk about is that I don't, I never hear publicly anyone acknowledging these things."
1027.56,1030.56," You know, that's your mic."
1030.56,1031.56, You're rubbing your beard.
1031.56,1032.56, Rubbing my beard.
1032.56,1034.56," And it's making, sorry."
1034.56,1038.56, And it's like just pretending they don't exist doesn't make it not true.
1038.56,1042.56," You know, I mean, immediately you see so many people's reactions from other outlets."
1042.56,1043.56," Well, we never do this."
1043.56,1046.56, I can guarantee you that nothing like this ever happens here.
1046.56,1047.56, And that's to simplify the thing.
1047.56,1049.56," It's like, well, of course, it hasn't happened."
1049.56,1055.56," And we can all say, yes, no one's ever told us that we need to say to be kinder or to raise our scores."
1055.56,1060.56, But we also are all aware of the way the business works and the pressures.
1060.56,1063.56, And we do know the good things that come with kissing S.
1063.56,1073.56," And when you, when you write reviews in such a way that you're basically trying to sell a product when you're writing it like a sales pitch, there's good things that come of that, you know."
1073.56,1076.56, And there's other things too.
1076.56,1081.56," I mean, there's so many different lines that you can cross that cause problems and everyone's aware that they're full of shit if they say otherwise."
1081.56,1088.56," So if you, for example, if we had an exclusive review on our cover and it were to get, we were to say, wow, this isn't that good."
1088.56,1090.56, We're not going to give it a good game.
1091.56,1095.56," Someone in that department would say, we better tell."
1095.56,1098.56, We better give this publisher a heads up.
1098.56,1103.56," Yes, because this is going to seriously strain our relationship or if you just do it, then that would be it."
1103.56,1107.56, You would do it and they would be pissed off and you'd face all the repercussions that we've just outlined.
1107.56,1109.56," You know, so that's there."
1109.56,1111.56, And that means that is still a subtle pressure.
1111.56,1115.56, So if you're the person reviewing the game and you know what's the cover story and it's the exclusive review.
1116.56,1131.56," And you know, in addition to that, that it's supposed to be the big sell for your magazine and it's most, you know, that there's even since more eyes are going to be on it and it's going to be the only representative of scores on medic critic for some some period of time."
1131.56,1132.56, That pressure is there.
1132.56,1138.56," Well, this is a little bit reason why we stop doing exclusive reviews a while ago to avoid this issue entirely."
1138.56,1141.56, This specific issue of exclusive reviews.
1141.56,1146.56, We stop doing them in this magazine because because we didn't want to have to deal with that idea.
1146.56,1147.56, Right.
1147.56,1151.56," I mean, and that's yeah, anything you can do to just reduce that pressure."
1151.56,1156.56," I mean, so yeah, it's like, instead of burning all these bridges because we know we wouldn't, you know,"
1156.56,1161.56, we basically call it like we see it.
1161.56,1166.56, And we were also aware that that potentially means burning bridges with a lot of people over these high stake things.
1166.56,1167.56, Yeah.
1167.56,1173.56, And I think also it's kind of like reaching this hysteria in this fever pitch this year and all the years I've been in the business.
1173.56,1176.56, You've got much more experience so you can come out to this.
1176.56,1180.56, But it seems like this year is almost is worse than ever.
1180.56,1196.56," And this person thing, this is to me, this was inevitable something like this like it's been building this this bullshit pressure that the publishers will put on the media because they have so much power over people and charge it."
1196.56,1208.56," The media outlets, pop financial power, monetary power that eventually somebody was going to buckle the firewall is going to break somebody was going to do it and it appears to have happened here."
1208.56,1210.56, Maybe didn't.
1210.56,1211.56, Maybe we don't know enough.
1211.56,1212.56, We don't know.
1212.56,1213.56, But that's yet to know.
1213.56,1216.56, Maybe this way we're not dismissing it immediately.
1216.56,1219.56, Why were at least entertaining the thought along with everyone else?
1219.56,1222.56," Right. And you know, I mean, look, it took a scene at what?"
1222.56,1228.56, Like a week here or a few days to come up with a kind of public announcement.
1228.56,1236.56," First of all, the fact that they had to make a public announcement, you know, who has to write a public press release about about a employee."
1236.56,1241.56, When does this ever happen in the games media that a press release comes out because an editor got fired?
1241.56,1242.56, Right.
1242.56,1245.56, I'm clearly there's something fishy about this that they're acknowledging.
1245.56,1250.56," But I mean, of course, it probably says there was nothing fishy about it that in fact,"
1250.56,1252.56, actually I have an infront of me.
1252.56,1253.56, I should read that.
1253.56,1254.56, I'll read this.
1254.56,1258.56, This is on the front page of GameSpot.
1258.56,1261.56," The headline is Gersdman GameSpot, part ways."
1261.56,1262.56, That's the headline.
1262.56,1268.56," The deck is after nearly 11 years of news reviews and previews, editorial directors tenure ends."
1268.56,1272.56, GameSpot editors address controversies surrounding his departure.
1272.56,1274.56, Okay. That was the long-winded deck.
1274.56,1276.56, Here's the article.
1276.56,1282.56, The past week marked the end of an era at GameSpot after over a decade in a variety of editorial roles.
1282.56,1286.56, Jeff Gersdman's tenure as editorial director has ended.
1286.56,1288.56, It just ended.
1288.56,1289.56, Right.
1289.56,1290.56, It has ended.
1290.56,1298.56," There are, you know, to be fair though, when when you terminate an employee, well, of course, you're not able to go to the public statement as to why."
1298.56,1305.56, And then the employees are going to say Jeff Gersdman's tenure as editor has ended because we fired his ass.
1305.56,1306.56, Right.
1306.56,1307.56, Or who knows what it can be?
1307.56,1308.56," Not him, but he's someone else."
1308.56,1310.56," Say there was, you know, it company X."
1310.56,1314.56, There was someone was fired for sexual harassment or something like that.
1314.56,1319.56," You're not going to go out and say, and I'm not, I don't mean you don't apply that this is the case with him whatsoever."
1319.56,1320.56, Right.
1320.56,1325.56, But by way of analogy to show that it's one of the reasons why you don't disclose the reasons that you fire people.
1325.56,1326.56, Of course.
1326.56,1330.56," And there's so many, there's so much potential for lawsuits and going back and forth."
1330.56,1335.56," So I'm just saying to keep it in mind, I mean, they aren't going to be able to say that much."
1335.56,1336.56, Of course I can't.
1336.56,1339.56, And that has this is why Jeff can't either.
1339.56,1345.56," You know, neither parties can, which is why we're really going to never, honestly, really never know exactly what happened here."
1345.56,1346.56, Right.
1346.56,1354.56," And so yeah, and you wouldn't even know, like say, if, you know, he signed, along with the severance package, he signed an agreement to not talk for X number of years."
1354.56,1355.56, Right.
1355.56,1359.56," Even after those years pass, and then he does talk about it, then that's still one side of the story."
1359.56,1360.56, Right.
1360.56,1370.56," In fact, they say, I'm skipping a little bit here, but due to legal constraints and the company policy of game spot parents seen at networks details of Gersmons departure cannot be disclosed publicly."
1370.56,1379.56," However, contrary to widespread and unproven reports, his exit was not a result of pressure from an advertiser."
1379.56,1388.56, And then they quote quotes neither seen at networks nor gamespot has ever allowed its advertising business to affect its editorial content.
1388.56,1398.56," The Greg Bran and scene at networks entertainment vice president of programming quote, the accusations in the media that has done so are unsubstantiated and untrue."
1398.56,1407.56, Jeff's departure stemmed from internal reasons unrelated to any buyer of advertising on game spot.
1407.56,1414.56," Though he will be missed by his colleagues, just leaving does not affect game spots core mission of delivering the most timely news."
1414.56,1422.56, Video content in the previous and unbiased reviews in games journalism said Ryan McDonald executive editor of Game Spot Live.
1422.56,1428.56, Game Spot is an institution and it's code of ethics and duty to its users remains unchanged.
1428.56,1432.56," Okay, so that's their official statement."
1432.56,1443.56," You know, without any real evidence or or or quotes or anything to the contrary, all you can do is take it at face."
1443.56,1446.56, You can take it at face value.
1446.56,1455.56," And will you do look, I mean the dots are at least worth examining and some of those as you know we've pointed out are when it seems like everyone who works for the company is uniformly."
1455.56,1466.56," Distraught and being really really weird and awkward about it, you know, and understandably so you know by which I mean to blog and then five minutes later edit that down and apologize."
1466.56,1472.56," Well, let's take it from our own perspective like imagine, you know."
1472.56,1482.56," Well, I guess you could take me right. I would kind of be just parallel. He was a gamespot for eleven years and I've been here for about eleven years. So imagine."
1482.56,1489.56, You come in one day and I've been fired or review I had written was pulled.
1489.56,1497.56, A video review I had done was pulled and now you're supposed to carry on. I mean what's going through your heads.
1497.56,1501.56, I mean I can't imagine well maybe part of it is like thank God that moron's gone.
1501.56,1509.56, But you know maybe the rest of it is you know oldies what am I supposed to write now what what happens next time.
1509.56,1511.56, I write a negative for you. Talk to us too.
1511.56,1524.56, Right and then I was just gone and then I would assume that you talk talk to us and then at that point we'd say well we've worked with you for however many years we feel like we know you and we can trust you and then it's not.
1524.56,1533.56, You know then then we can judge whether or not we feel you're giving us some bullshit story and you really didn't get fired for stealing or something else ridiculous now you're making this whole thing up.
1533.56,1539.56, Right maybe I was like taking a dump in the urn all.
1539.56,1540.56, You wouldn't admit that.
1540.56,1545.56, No right of course I'd rather probably to say that I lowballed a review rather than admit that.
1545.56,1548.56, And that was not in fact my dump in the urn all that way.
1548.56,1566.56, To go back to the to the sort of hysteria that's happening this year the most sense I can make from that is that the stakes are now so high to make to successfully make and market a game that Ryan's laughing.
1566.56,1570.56, Sorry trying to try and change the series from the dumps in the year.
1570.56,1578.56, No but so it cost an extraordinary amount of money to make what we call triple a game.
1578.56,1590.56, And the market is tighter than ever I mean you see these big games that you know were developers and publishers clearly spent millions making them in marketing them and then they fail.
1590.56,1597.56, And that's like a huge wage or to make and not many companies can withstand failing you know losing those bets indefinitely.
1597.56,1611.56, And so they want to do everything in the power to hedge that bet and scores is one way to do it and that's also tied into meta critics and that I think is another in addition to the high stakes nature things now is also the way that.
1612.56,1620.56, Agregate scoring sites the role that that that decides play right because it's even if in the past before those sites existed.
1620.56,1630.56, You have whatever eGM say gives a game a six that a lot of other sites gave us some fiber and eight you know it's just well that's fine that's an eGM thing but now.
1630.56,1634.96, The employees of these companies are getting bonuses based on the
1634.96,1639.0, Metacritic score and that's factoring into whether or not they immediately
1639.0,1643.52," greenlight a sequel, even before they have sales figures, you know."
1643.52,1647.2," Then it's more, well, what is your sixth doing to the average?"
1647.2,1648.2, What does it mean?
1648.2,1649.2, It's influencing it.
1649.2,1651.6799999999998," So when you can just look at the whole thing, it's like, well, what are you doing for our"
1651.6799999999998,1653.0, Metacritic thing?
1653.0,1656.28, And I hear this like time and time again from people that work in development and PR and
1656.28,1659.48, everything is that they live and die by that average.
1659.48,1661.72," What we've talked about this in the podcast before, right?"
1661.72,1664.24," This is the, that's the phone call we always get."
1664.24,1665.24, Right.
1665.24,1669.56," How come it was seven on Earth's eight on Metacritic and you guys gave it a five,"
1669.56,1672.24," you know, well, because we thought differently about the game."
1672.24,1673.72," And then that, but that's what we always did."
1673.72,1678.3600000000001," Or even just be, you know, they're not waiting our numbers properly."
1678.3600000000001,1682.28," You know, there's these, like, all of that to think where the averages are in this"
1682.28,1683.28, fairly different.
1683.28,1685.04, And we say a five is an average.
1685.04,1686.28, We try to enforce that.
1686.28,1689.2," And this is like, say, for example, if you look at the game spot, Kail, interview"
1689.2,1693.04," in the video review that that would spin pulled, when I listen to those and when I read"
1693.04,1695.1200000000001," that, I don't see a six at all."
1695.1200000000001,1699.04," I see like a four, you know, maybe a between somewhere between three, five and four,"
1699.04,1700.04, five or whatever.
1700.04,1701.24, And I don't see the six at all.
1701.24,1707.0," My coat, he's describing an unfun game through and through and talking about some"
1707.0,1710.8," potential at my to had, but didn't deliver on, but that in my mind, and then saying,"
1710.8,1712.16," hey, that's an above average score."
1712.16,1713.16, That doesn't add up.
1713.16,1716.28," So yeah, I mean, like, that's a difference in between that, that's indicative of the"
1716.28,1720.32," fact that, you know, in our, you know, Rubrik of five is the average."
1720.32,1724.56, I do actually find it ironic that of all things for this to blow up over.
1724.56,1730.52," It is a game like this where, you know, which by all accounts is fairly mediocre."
1730.52,1734.48," And in fact, his six isn't that far out of line even from the meta critics."
1734.48,1736.72," I mean, this isn't like, you know, that's a line at all."
1736.72,1742.2," A game that was getting 9.5 or something that the sky had, you know, so to wildly"
1742.2,1744.32, different opinion from everybody else.
1744.48,1744.92, Right.
1746.32,1748.84, Not that the things are too related at all.
1748.84,1754.48, We know that his review and his leaving were not the fact related according to
1754.48,1757.92, scene at what's clarified that they've cleared the air now.
1757.92,1762.52," So, last I be accused of throwing stones."
1762.52,1763.52, I'm not.
1763.52,1766.0," Yeah, we've explained that."
1766.0,1773.48," I mean, so if you earlier, I was saying how sometimes it seems to me like a writer of"
1773.48,1775.72, review is writing for a publisher.
1775.72,1776.72, Sure.
1776.72,1779.3600000000001, A little bit in in one bit of evidence for that.
1779.3600000000001,1780.68, I don't think it might be deliberate.
1780.68,1784.0," I don't think it's ever conscious where someone says, wow, I got to make sure that this"
1784.0,1785.88, is just okay for the publisher.
1785.88,1788.72," But again, it's like when I talk about these pressures, they're indirect, but they're"
1788.72,1789.72, there in the back of your mind.
1789.72,1792.1200000000001, And I think the influence the way you go about things.
1792.1200000000001,1794.8, So there's this phenomenon in game reviews.
1794.8,1797.1200000000001, I don't quite have a name for it.
1797.1200000000001,1798.3600000000001, Maybe someone can help me coin one.
1798.3600000000001,1803.3600000000001," But it's basically a flip flop, you know, or it's just, it's kind of like letting"
1803.8799999999999,1807.9199999999998, something critical slip through and then immediately backtracking and apologizing it away.
1807.9199999999998,1810.3999999999999, I didn't really mean to say negative thing.
1810.3999999999999,1812.76," The close, this is a, well, it's a strong man, right?"
1812.76,1814.6," I mean, it's a,"
1814.6,1815.84," Hey, Brandon now, gee, I got this."
1815.84,1820.1599999999999," It chimpanzees have been documented to, you know, it's going somewhere."
1820.1599999999999,1826.8799999999999," Well, they basically show their teeth when they're teeth when they're frightened, right?"
1826.8799999999999,1831.08, But some chimps have also been observed hiding covering their mouth after they've shown
1831.08,1836.24," it because in a dominant hierarchy, say you're one of the more dominant figures."
1836.24,1840.3999999999999, And you've inadvertently shown revealed that you're afraid of someone that's subordinate
1840.3999999999999,1841.3999999999999, to you.
1841.3999999999999,1842.3999999999999, You want to cover that up.
1842.3999999999999,1843.3999999999999," You don't want to hide it, right?"
1843.3999999999999,1847.04," They've also covered their, not to take it back to sex, but they'll cover their, their"
1847.04,1851.3999999999999, genitals and stuff if they have an erection and they're seen by a female that is actually
1851.3999999999999,1854.1999999999998," not supposed to be in his access, you know?"
1854.1999999999998,1855.1999999999998, So it's kind of like that.
1855.1999999999998,1856.96, I just feel like you read these things.
1856.96,1858.84," It's like, hey, you just got caught bearing your teeth."
1858.84,1859.84, You better cover that shit up.
1860.32,1865.0," For someone notices and, and calls out the fact that you were actually doing something"
1865.0,1866.0, you weren't supposed to be doing.
1866.0,1868.4399999999998," And that's actually being, being a critic, being critical."
1869.4399999999998,1876.6799999999998," So an example would be this from a, from a major source, it says, the pretty face lift"
1876.6799999999998,1880.6799999999998," and refined game mechanics are great, but they can only mass the fact that SmackDown"
1880.6799999999998,1883.12, 07 is still frustrating button measure.
1883.9199999999998,1888.08," And then the very next sentence is, that's not to say it isn't an enjoyable experience,"
1888.12,1891.8799999999999," however, SmackDown 07 isn't undeniably good looking game."
1891.8799999999999,1898.08," So, I mean, like in there, you have, I mean, a frustrating button measure, and then suddenly"
1898.08,1899.08, it's enjoyable.
1899.08,1900.56," I mean, well, what is it?"
1900.56,1903.3999999999999," You know, I mean, and, and not saying everyone does it, but it's fairly common."
1903.3999999999999,1905.52," I think you start looking, you'll see it over and over again."
1905.52,1906.96," I mean, to be fair, it's everywhere."
1906.96,1908.52, I just saw them shirts and our own magazine.
1908.52,1913.28," I saw something went up on one up today, where, I mean, it was immediately, it's"
1913.28,1916.12," said, you know, unfortunately the game will act tense, we'll feed back when we shot"
1916.12,1919.76," a opponent and occasionally repeated firewood seemed to do nothing, but bounce off any"
1919.76,1920.76, armor.
1920.76,1926.76," And then the next sentence, again, is, however, the graphics look polish, the map layouts were"
1926.76,1929.1599999999999, strong and the grenades were a blast to use.
1929.1599999999999,1934.3999999999999," So, well, some of this is just probably writing ability and structure."
1934.3999999999999,1940.6799999999998," I mean, it's completely like any, any product, any piece of art or literature, whatever,"
1940.6799999999998,1942.4799999999998," has its pros and cons, right?"
1942.4799999999998,1946.08," I mean, so being able to say like this one part of the game is great."
1946.08,1948.32, And the southern part of the game sucks.
1948.32,1950.1599999999999," It's not, there's nothing wrong with that."
1950.1599999999999,1951.1599999999999, Right.
1951.1599999999999,1952.1599999999999, Of course.
1952.1599999999999,1953.1599999999999, It's sort of like juxtaposing these two things.
1953.1599999999999,1954.1599999999999," In fact, that's always juxtaposing."
1954.1599999999999,1960.56," And it's always in that order, too, where some good comes around immediately after the"
1960.56,1961.56, bad to try to undo it.
1961.56,1962.56, Right.
1962.56,1966.52," To show you, you know, to be fair, that could just be a result of this established, like"
1966.52,1968.3999999999999, this is how game reviews go structure.
1968.3999999999999,1974.04," Yeah, it could be that too, where you just see exactly you just put this, but this, but this,"
1974.04,1978.8," conclusion, right, for all these time, it's writing reviews."
1978.8,1982.32, Let's send that out to our staff.
1982.32,1983.32, Please follow this for me.
1983.32,1987.56," And then like, the my one thing is, you know, you see so many, there's always this, like,"
1987.56,1989.24," one sentences, my one complaint."
1989.24,1990.84," If it's all good, that's how you will."
1990.84,1992.3999999999999, I'm not totally retarded.
1992.3999999999999,1993.3999999999999, Here's another one.
1993.3999999999999,1995.04," I've got some, like, I got one critical."
1995.04,2000.1599999999999," And then another one, usually there's many, many concluding paragraphs that start"
2000.1599999999999,2001.1599999999999, niggles aside.
2001.1599999999999,2002.96," Yes, that's the same version of."
2002.96,2003.96, Yeah.
2003.96,2004.96, It goes aside.
2004.96,2008.96," And that's really, I mean, yeah, I believe that's true."
2008.96,2013.96," Exactly what you're saying, Sean, because you know what happens is, you have reviews."
2013.96,2016.96," And especially with websites and stuff, you have to get these things out fast."
2016.96,2019.32," But yeah, it's a long, it takes you to get it out."
2019.32,2021.72, The less people are going to care about reading it.
2021.72,2022.72, Right.
2022.72,2024.1200000000001," And the more, there's so many games coming out."
2024.1200000000001,2025.1200000000001, And you've got to crank it out.
2025.1200000000001,2030.16, And the only way to do that is to rely on these structures on these boiler plates.
2030.16,2033.16," And unfortunately, the boiler plates are largely bullshit, you know."
2033.16,2035.64, And that's like you gave an example of one.
2035.64,2037.92," And if you've been doing it for a while, you'll recognize all the boiler plates."
2037.92,2038.92, Yeah.
2038.92,2039.92," Oh, he used boiler plates."
2039.92,2040.92, See.
2040.92,2042.8000000000002, And you just fit in the game names.
2042.8000000000002,2046.1200000000001," The problem with that, of course, those, I mean, if you want useful reviews is that"
2046.1200000000001,2050.32," you're not, it's not just that you're looking at templated writing, but I think that the"
2050.32,2052.6," template structure of the thinking, you know."
2052.6,2056.6," So you're not actually, it's, it's actually the lack of insight and engagement with the"
2056.6,2057.6, game and just filling it in.
2057.6,2059.28, And you have these really weird scenarios.
2059.28,2063.0," You know, maybe I could talk later today about Soldier Fortune payback, which I just"
2063.0,2067.32," reviewed and browsing around, you'll see people commenting on, you know, one paragraph"
2067.32,2070.24," they'll comment on, you know, blowing people's faces off."
2070.24,2073.52," And this, and then the very next one, they'll say how, and then the music's catchy."
2073.52,2078.24," We're doing normal person, that seems, you know, like a sign of social pathie, right?"
2078.24,2080.24," I mean, very much."
2080.24,2084.6," I mean, you know, if you're in, if someone's in a room and they're talking about, you"
2084.6,2086.32," know, blowing, blowing these dudes away."
2086.32,2087.72, And it's very lifelike.
2087.72,2089.92, And they drag their bloody stumps across the ground.
2089.92,2091.08, And the music's pretty catchy.
2091.16,2095.0," You would, you say, well, this is a social pathie."
2095.0,2096.0, I don't feel it.
2096.0,2098.56," But it's again, it's just a sign of the template there."
2098.56,2099.56, And but I think it's both.
2099.56,2101.96," It's, the template is making it a bad review."
2101.96,2105.44," And the template's also providing someone from thinking, even understanding what they're"
2105.44,2106.44, saying.
2106.44,2107.44, Yeah.
2107.44,2110.68," So it's like, hey, I have to have the audio paragraph that comes after the, whatever, that's"
2110.68,2111.84, a control paragraph.
2111.84,2115.2, And then you have those things that make you look like a social path because you really
2115.2,2118.0," aren't thinking about what it is you're saying, you know, right?"
2118.0,2121.68, Did you get that one out there?
2121.68,2123.0, Just like that one.
2123.0,2124.0, Right.
2124.0,2126.4," Not to, not to tute my own horn here."
2126.4,2133.4," But the, that green speak I wrote a while ago, that the Cuddle of Xanthor story, you"
2133.4,2137.2," know, that that, that people still think is, is a legitimate."
2137.2,2141.68," Well, that's why I'm bringing it up because because, because what I did there was I took"
2141.68,2144.68," every, I took this cliche that we're talking about this format."
2144.68,2149.3199999999997," I did the, the, the, the graphics paragraph, the water effects paragraph, the sound paragraph."
2149.3199999999997,2150.3199999999997, Yeah.
2150.3199999999997,2151.3199999999997, And you did it.
2151.3199999999997,2152.3199999999997, I thought like a hands-on preview.
2152.3199999999997,2153.3199999999997," I did, I said it was, it wasn't a review."
2153.3199999999997,2154.64, It was a hands-on preview.
2154.64,2157.52," But in fact, there was nothing, nothing existed in this game."
2157.52,2159.44," I mean, first of all, I made it up in my head."
2159.44,2162.3199999999997, But the point was that the company itself had nothing to show me.
2162.3199999999997,2163.6, There wasn't a game.
2163.6,2166.2," But I, yet I still wrote about all those things."
2166.2,2168.2799999999997," And I, and I kept saying how great it all was."
2168.2799999999997,2170.24, And it was so clearly parody to us.
2170.24,2171.24, Right.
2171.24,2174.64," And yet I still will get emails from people saying, like, that game sounds really good."
2175.6,2177.2799999999997," And you, how good sound good."
2177.2799999999997,2178.2799999999997, I didn't say anything.
2178.2799999999997,2181.96," There's a big shed on, the big shed on, on game thread."
2181.96,2183.08," No, on game shed."
2183.08,2183.92, The whole game shed.
2183.92,2184.92, I'm sure.
2184.92,2188.3199999999997," And people are arguing about, well, listen to this fucking hypocrite."
2188.3199999999997,2189.72, You ever listened to GFW radio?
2189.72,2192.3199999999997," Oh, yeah, but people who didn't shed that, yeah, I'm not writing."
2192.3199999999997,2193.16, Look at this.
2193.16,2193.52, Right.
2193.52,2196.0," And then like, even in a point, that was awesome."
2196.0,2197.0, That was awesome.
2197.0,2198.8799999999997," And the whole jumps in the thread and like, oh, God, did a freelancer do this?"
2198.8799999999997,2199.8799999999997, Yeah.
2199.8799999999997,2200.8799999999997," It was like, wow, really watched it."
2200.8799999999997,2202.4," You were a little too subtle, I guess."
2202.4,2203.6, Even though I thought it was beating us.
2203.6,2206.6, I thought it was way over the top.
2206.6,2207.6, Yeah.
2207.6,2214.2," But what that told me was that, you know, people will just read that."
2214.2,2221.2," You know, if you operate within that template, you know, you can make literally anything"
2221.2,2222.2, sound great.
2222.2,2223.2, Right.
2223.2,2224.4, I made nothing.
2224.4,2227.2, Absolutely nothing be a game that people wanted to play.
2227.2,2229.7999999999997, I can't wait for this game.
2229.7999999999997,2232.0, This is still tied into tune.
2232.0,2233.0, I think that previews.
2233.0,2239.6," I have a problem with non-evalutive hands-on previews, especially when we're talking,"
2239.6,2243.08," you know, in the months of immediately prior to the game's release, where you know that"
2243.08,2246.6," for the most part, they're working eliminating bugs."
2246.6,2247.6, That's it.
2247.6,2250.24, The game that you're playing is the game that's going to be people's hands.
2250.24,2251.24, Right.
2251.24,2252.24, Give her takes on the bugs.
2252.24,2254.88," And, you know, a lot, it's been this big debate."
2254.88,2260.48," And it kind of, you know, EGM went through it with their two human hands-on story."
2260.48,2261.48, Right.
2261.48,2262.48, E3.
2262.48,2265.2400000000002, And it's odd to me to still see people.
2265.2400000000002,2266.2400000000002," You know, there's this one guy."
2266.2400000000002,2270.8," This one guy was blogging about how that was a, he was calling it a review that they"
2270.8,2271.8, reviewed.
2271.8,2273.8, They misledingly reviewed this game that wasn't done.
2273.8,2274.8, Which was really insane.
2274.8,2278.04," I mean, not because they're in the same building, because I used to work there, but"
2278.04,2283.56," because, I mean, rationally, it was packaged in a previews feature."
2283.56,2287.64," And when you start off, it says that this is a previous feature and that this, you know,"
2287.64,2290.88," where this annual games convention, where we're able to play these games and what we're"
2290.88,2295.12, going to do is sort of evaluate our experience with these games.
2295.12,2299.4," It's not, we're not going to give it scores that are consistent with the scoring system"
2299.4,2300.7200000000003, we use for our review section.
2300.7200000000003,2301.7200000000003, That's later in the book.
2301.7200000000003,2302.7200000000003, You'll see that there.
2302.7200000000003,2306.2400000000002," And you'll see how different it is from this, you know, just going to comment on these."
2306.2400000000002,2309.2000000000003," And the reason being is to make it worth your while, right?"
2309.2000000000003,2311.92, Because there's no one that goes to these things and plays these games and doesn't
2311.92,2313.6, form some opinion.
2313.6,2318.92," And also, the beginning of that article pointed out that, like, hey, these opinions can"
2318.92,2319.92, change.
2319.92,2322.08, This is the game's contingent and they'll change along with the game.
2322.08,2326.0," So all that in place, someone was freaking out about that and a lot of people were freaking"
2326.0,2327.36, out about that.
2327.36,2331.92," But, but, but, but, but, but it's hard for some people to understand the difference between"
2331.92,2340.92," a review and a preview, kind of like a, I don't show it on the website."
2340.92,2341.92, There you go.
2341.92,2342.92," Just today, wasn't it?"
2342.92,2344.92," It was just a story, at least."
2344.92,2349.88," Yeah, I think it's gone now, but it was pointed out on Cataco and you could find"
2349.88,2356.88," it on NeoGafts so you can, you could find images of what happened that these guys,"
2356.88,2361.88," just, they're, they really want some good keen and interviews that they could add us."
2361.88,2363.12, They're going to some extremes.
2363.12,2365.32, So there was no way it could have been an accident.
2365.32,2366.32," Well, of course."
2366.32,2370.96," There were, there were quotes taken from previews of games and they were accompanied"
2370.96,2371.96, with five stars.
2371.96,2372.96, Right.
2372.96,2375.96, And they were taken from some sites that used stars like games buying others.
2375.96,2376.96, Right.
2376.96,2381.12," And by, in fact, had reviewed the game and given it three stars."
2381.12,2386.32," However, I'd asked very cleverly, chose to quote from a preview that games by road before"
2386.32,2390.32," the game came out, which was a glowing preview sentence."
2390.32,2395.56," And above that glowing sentence from the preview, they had a five star, they had a five"
2395.56,2397.04, star logo above it.
2397.04,2398.04, Right.
2398.04,2402.04," I guess as someone over there, there's a total speculation just like convince themselves"
2402.04,2403.64, that it's just a design element.
2403.64,2404.64, It's okay.
2404.64,2405.64, Right.
2405.64,2410.4," So it's like, it's like, it's like, it's such a deliberate attempt to mislead."
2410.4,2413.64," Even if you say, even if you're like, oh, it's a design element."
2413.64,2418.6, That's basically packaging your alibi with the crime at the time that you commit the game.
2418.6,2419.6, Right.
2419.6,2420.6, Right.
2420.6,2421.6, It is.
2421.6,2422.6, I'm here.
2422.6,2423.6, That's what I meant by convinced themselves.
2423.6,2424.6, Yeah.
2424.6,2426.6," And in fact, it's peer fucking bullshit."
2426.6,2427.6, They shouldn't have done it.
2427.6,2428.6, They got called.
2428.6,2429.6, They're not going to be a part of the game.
2429.6,2430.6, They're not going to be a part of the game.
2430.6,2431.6, They're not going to be a part of the game.
2431.6,2432.6, They're not going to be a part of the game.
2432.6,2433.6, They're not going to be a part of the game.
2434.08,2435.08, They shouldn't have done it.
2435.08,2437.52," They got called on it and in fact, now it's gone."
2437.52,2438.24, It does.
2438.24,2439.92, To show that they knew it was wrong.
2439.92,2444.52," And it does highlight the disparity between the content of previous interviews very nicely,"
2444.52,2447.8399999999997," though, because when you look at the comments, you're like, huh?"
2447.8399999999997,2450.68," And then you're like, you know, then you're like, hey, well, then there's the review."
2450.68,2451.68, And it's what?
2451.68,2454.72," So though for that, for after the government thing to do that this way,"
2454.72,2456.2799999999997," it's like, are you kidding me?"
2456.2799999999997,2457.52, That is mind blowing.
2457.52,2461.68," I mean, that's like the dumbest move that anyone could."
2461.68,2465.16, We're not sure if everybody hates us enough yet.
2465.16,2466.7599999999998, What could we do?
2466.7599999999998,2470.3199999999997, There are some people still are giving us some credibility here.
2470.3199999999997,2474.16, We haven't completely shot our reputation as shit.
2474.16,2475.9199999999996," I know, sir."
2475.9199999999996,2476.9199999999996, What the hell?
2476.9199999999996,2479.96," I just just forums are a mess right now too, aren't they?"
2479.96,2480.56, Really?
2480.56,2481.7999999999997," Well, they were over the weekend."
2481.7999999999997,2484.6, I haven't been there lately since I got trash.
2484.6,2487.52," I'm sorry, Sean, I interrupted your, you're, no, that's why those,"
2487.52,2489.6, that needed to be said.
2489.6,2492.16, That was a vital part of the conversation.
2492.16,2493.0, It was.
2493.0,2495.44," I mean, that's mind blowing that that happened."
2495.44,2496.6," It's, it's sad."
2496.6,2497.6, Yeah.
2497.6,2500.44," Well, what about the previous thing, the fished up?"
2500.44,2501.6, Yep.
2501.6,2504.8," Like I've said before, you know, game companies internally, you know,"
2504.8,2508.4, employ people that are evaluators and they are there to play early
2508.4,2509.4, builds.
2509.4,2511.44," Sometimes they just look at design documents, you know, or they'll play"
2511.44,2512.44," late builds, whatever."
2512.44,2516.12," And they come to these conclusions and say, this game's going to be fun."
2516.12,2518.2799999999997, It's going to make some money.
2518.2799999999997,2522.0, So game companies themselves very clearly believe in people's
2522.0,2525.08," ability to evaluate unfinished product, right?"
2525.08,2526.88," But then whenever it comes to previous and you ask people,"
2526.88,2529.96, why is it that you never voice any skepticism?
2529.96,2532.08," They say, well, because we can't, you know."
2532.08,2534.04," So even, I don't even believe in that."
2534.04,2535.24, I think you do have to be careful.
2535.24,2536.64," If it's early, it's early."
2536.64,2538.2799999999997, But a lot of times you will get a sense.
2538.2799999999997,2541.6," I bet if you, if you ask any of us in this, in this floor,"
2541.6,2545.52," say, go back to the various times that you saw any given game."
2545.52,2548.52," It probably was very much like you thought, you know, you weren't"
2548.52,2551.12," probably, if you're gut, even if you never wrote it or told anyone"
2551.12,2553.84," and your gut's like, this is probably going to be like a six game,"
2553.84,2555.24," you know, or this is really bad."
2555.24,2557.6, This is going to be below average.
2557.6,2560.92," Oftentimes, they turn out exactly like you're thinking."
2560.92,2561.4, Sure.
2561.4,2562.4, And I know that for fact.
2562.4,2566.48," But so that aside, when we're talking about hands on previews that"
2566.48,2569.6," are immediately proceeding the launch, I think that there is"
2569.6,2571.4, dishonesty there.
2571.4,2573.72, I think a lot of times they just don't.
2573.72,2575.7999999999997, It's dishonesty by omission.
2575.7999999999997,2579.16, You just don't say anything bad or sometimes like you can.
2579.16,2580.72," I mean, again, not to pick on anyone."
2580.72,2582.72," I'll pick on every, you know, ourselves."
2582.72,2583.9599999999996, We do what everyone does it.
2583.9599999999996,2585.8399999999997, But just this was a convenient example.
2585.8399999999997,2586.8399999999997, I had available.
2586.8399999999997,2589.2799999999997, And it's about black site because I was looking to see after
2589.2799999999997,2592.7599999999998, I write a review all often compared my perspective with other
2592.7599999999998,2597.16, critics and see if I was like off in my own little world or one.
2597.16,2600.8399999999997," And so this preview says, you know,"
2600.8399999999997,2603.48, made way shout to new levels of its upcoming shooter black site area
2603.48,2607.44," 51, which got us even more excited for its November 5 ship date."
2607.44,2609.52, The game play in black site is always a treat.
2609.52,2611.84, And it's keeping head black side of shaping up to be one of the hottest
2611.84,2615.2400000000002, shooters of the holiday season with two player co-op play online multiplayer
2615.2400000000002,2617.04, and a cool blend of reality with science fiction.
2617.04,2619.56, We're looking forward to several close encounters with black site
2619.56,2621.08, when it ships on November 5.
2621.08,2624.0," So aside from the date, the constant pimping of the date there"
2624.0,2626.2400000000002, and the sales stuff.
2626.2400000000002,2630.2400000000002," This is, so two hands on levels in the way that the date goes out."
2630.24,2635.12, I believe you could play 15 minutes with any level in this game
2635.12,2640.4799999999996, and immediately understand that this is not going to be an excellent game.
2640.4799999999996,2642.72, At least it's not going to be one that you look forward to several
2642.72,2647.2," close encounters with as the quote says or very clever though,"
2647.2,2648.7599999999998, or to get it close encounters.
2648.7599999999998,2649.7599999999998, I get it.
2649.7599999999998,2650.7599999999998," Yeah, that's trying not to."
2650.7599999999998,2651.7599999999998, You know what?
2651.7599999999998,2655.56, They should use that in the app or to say that it's always a treat.
2655.56,2658.6," So I mean, to just pick on that, but I see a lot of things like that."
2659.04,2662.8399999999997, And that's why I remember when I got it and started playing it.
2662.8399999999997,2664.48," Remember, you were here Sean and you're right."
2664.48,2665.48, I kept calling you guys over.
2665.48,2669.52," I was like, wow, why did no one say anything about this?"
2669.52,2671.88," You know, I'm a leaf of the one warned me."
2671.88,2673.08," Yeah, no one."
2673.08,2674.7599999999998," And it was like, I know the demos out."
2674.7599999999998,2676.6, I never played it the one that was on Xbox Live.
2676.6,2679.52," You know, it was like, why did no one ever say anything about this?"
2679.52,2680.8399999999997," This game sucks, dude."
2680.8399999999997,2683.96," And it was like, there's no way a month ago that I would have been saying,"
2683.96,2687.2799999999997," well, maybe this guy's opinion just different than yours."
2687.28,2690.0," Hey, even the head developer thinks that came sucks."
2690.0,2691.7200000000003," Well, he's not hit the developer anymore."
2691.7200000000003,2692.6800000000003, He was fired.
2692.6800000000003,2696.88, It was a great week for me to realize he didn't get in the same problem.
2696.88,2698.8, Was he fired or did he leave?
2698.8,2699.8," Yeah, we don't know this."
2699.8,2700.28, Right.
2700.28,2701.28, I take that back.
2701.28,2702.2000000000003, A mutual agreement.
2702.2000000000003,2703.0800000000004, I take it back.
2703.0800000000004,2704.52," He wasn't, or we don't know."
2704.52,2704.88, We don't know.
2704.88,2706.6400000000003, But he doesn't work there anymore.
2706.6400000000003,2708.6400000000003, He did say the game was messed up.
2708.6400000000003,2708.92, Right.
2708.92,2712.84," And after saying how messed up it was, he said it, but it deserved a net."
2712.84,2713.84, Right.
2713.84,2714.36," Yeah, true."
2714.36,2719.84," So he even in his complaints of the game, he's on the 7 to 9 scale with everybody else."
2719.84,2720.84, Which was great.
2720.84,2722.84, But we should have actual quote with us.
2722.84,2724.7200000000003," It was like this game, the development was fucked."
2724.7200000000003,2726.56, Developed was not saying seriously fucked up.
2726.56,2727.56, That's not necessarily the game.
2727.56,2728.56, That's like game trash.
2728.56,2729.56, It could have been a better.
2729.56,2730.56, That's true.
2730.56,2735.0, The tone of all this comments didn't seem to indicate any sort of confidence or pride in
2735.0,2736.0, the thing other than the story.
2736.0,2738.1200000000003, And I've talked about before and that is bold.
2738.1200000000003,2741.6800000000003," No, it was a reverse and move on their part."
2741.6800000000003,2742.6800000000003, But that was kind of weird.
2742.68,2746.04," And that, hey, you know, in all of this, you got to point out."
2746.04,2750.2799999999997," And that's why it's one reason why it's so frustrating when, you know, the whole Y-cell"
2750.2799999999997,2751.2799999999997, little thing.
2751.2799999999997,2755.08," You know, we get this pressure all the time."
2755.08,2759.08," You have to understand anyone ever writing a view is getting the pressure, like I said,"
2759.08,2761.2, indirectly and they're aware of it.
2761.2,2762.7599999999998," But it's there, right?"
2762.7599999999998,2766.12," And so the one, you're like, what's the only reason to fight it, right?"
2766.12,2768.7599999999998," Aside from just like ethics, I'm an ethical person."
2768.7599999999998,2771.56, I'm going to do the right thing as I believe it would be right.
2771.56,2775.6," Well, I'm also going to be doing the right thing specifically for an audience."
2775.6,2780.2, And then when the audience itself is actually with got the publishers back.
2780.2,2783.0, And when the audience is demanding on exactly what the publisher wants.
2783.0,2784.0, Right.
2784.0,2788.0," Then you start to say, well, why am I fighting so hard?"
2788.0,2789.6, Why am I causing myself trouble?
2789.6,2790.6, Right.
2790.6,2793.88," And why are we compromising the ability of, you know, our website magazine or whatever"
2793.88,2798.16," to provide, you know, content as soon as possible."
2798.16,2799.88, Like whatever we can't get it if our scores.
2799.88,2803.4," And when the, when our damn audience is mad, that the right should not meeting up"
2803.4,2807.36, the expectations of the bullshit fabricated scores on the press release on the game's
2807.36,2808.36, website.
2808.36,2810.92," So indeed Sean, why so low?"
2810.92,2811.92, Yeah.
2811.92,2815.92," And that was, Gertman's career is no, like, one of his big bullet points is that he"
2815.92,2819.52, gave Zelda an 8.8 and then the world like they're loaded on.
2819.52,2821.8, And there still are youing about that.
2821.8,2822.8, That's coming up.
2822.8,2823.8, Good thing he got fired.
2823.8,2824.8, He deserved it.
2824.8,2828.6," And it's like those people, like, yeah, God, if it weren't for the same people that are"
2828.6,2831.8399999999997," out there in the God bless him, yeah, like, I would be out of this business."
2831.8399999999997,2835.6," Like that's the same thing that has those people are completely, I got to keep reminding"
2835.6,2836.6, myself.
2836.6,2837.6, Man to the right.
2837.6,2838.6, They are.
2838.6,2839.6, People are out there.
2839.6,2840.6," Yeah, you're right."
2840.6,2841.6," Those people who are like, good."
2841.6,2844.6, Thank God he's gone because that 8.8 fuck you.
2844.6,2848.0," You're the reason that the guy's like, him or out of a job."
2848.0,2851.48," Did you do the, the other thing about it, the whole with the whole E to Dick thing in that"
2851.48,2852.48, blog?
2852.48,2858.44," I did hear that like, they were all mad and, and they were insinuating and"
2858.44,2862.52," people in their forms or whatever were insinuating that like, I was a PR hack."
2862.52,2866.28," And that was the best bit of like, or well, and logic, it was like, I don't get that."
2866.28,2870.32," Because it's games for Windows magazine and games for Windows podcasts, right?"
2870.32,2874.64," Because we're, because we're a, because we're, so if we're Microsoft PR hacks, why wouldn't"
2874.64,2876.2000000000003, we have given crisis a 10.
2876.2000000000003,2877.2000000000003, Exactly.
2877.2000000000003,2880.68, How long did it take you to reason that it was in my head?
2880.68,2884.8," But there are three seconds still on the internet, including some that run blogs that aren't"
2884.8,2886.8, able to make that.
2886.88,2887.8, That's a big stand that.
2887.8,2892.04," If, right, I mean, by that logic, every game in our magazine would get a 10."
2892.04,2893.04, Right.
2893.04,2894.04, Game for Windows is great.
2894.04,2897.84," But instead, no, it was a move, Dick hit a Microsoft wanted us to lowball."
2897.84,2898.84, They're big.
2898.84,2899.84, All right.
2899.84,2900.84, He's a game of the season.
2900.84,2901.84," Yeah, because that would make sense."
2901.84,2902.84, And lowball is in scare quotes there.
2902.84,2909.36," So I, glad we, if I came to the conclusion that people on the internet are dumb."
2909.36,2911.84, Except for everyone listening to this podcast.
2911.84,2912.84, So that's Martin.
2912.84,2913.84, We love you.
2913.84,2914.84, Yes.
2914.84,2916.44," I think people listening are going to wonder, well, what can we do about it?"
2916.96,2921.16," Also, and if they're wondering why we're bitching about this, the point of this is not"
2921.16,2927.64," to point fingers or to, to scold, seeing it because again, honestly, we don't know what"
2927.64,2928.64, happened.
2928.64,2932.28, There could have been a million complications to the girlsman think we don't know.
2932.28,2936.0, But with the scary part of it and the reason that we talk about it is because it's very
2936.0,2940.44, close to home to us for all the reasons Sean that you were saying that like these pressures
2940.44,2942.56, really are real.
2942.56,2951.56, And these barriers that we face in trying to write honest stories versus what the publishers
2951.56,2957.7599999999998," want, what some of the audience wants, some of the fanboys want are huge to us."
2957.7599999999998,2962.16," And this one just really, it was scary this girlsman think because it was so plausible."
2962.16,2965.6," Yeah, all it would take is, I mean, you get the right person at the top, you know, or"
2965.6,2968.6, the right people at the top and they just change their mind about that thing.
2968.6,2970.04," And then, yeah, it's all that it takes."
2970.12,2974.44," Oh, yeah, I know that all the incentives there and it takes that one person to not be"
2974.44,2975.44, steadfast.
2975.44,2980.56," You've got, I'm sure there have been a ton of times here on this floor that somebody on the"
2980.56,2982.56," other side of the building, the sales marketing."
2982.56,2986.7599999999998," So I'd have said out loud to other people in the room, can we just go for and tell those"
2986.7599999999998,2989.88, fuckers and editorial to stopping so harsh?
2989.88,2992.92," You know, they just never have actually done it."
2992.92,2993.92, Right.
2993.92,2996.8," I'm sure amongst themselves, they're like, they're killing themselves every time we publish"
2996.8,2997.8, a really mean review.
2997.8,2998.8, Yeah.
2998.8,3001.52," And they're going, God, David, there goes my fucking bonus."
3001.52,3003.7200000000003," And they're probably thinking like, we're trying to help you guys."
3003.7200000000003,3005.7200000000003, You guys are shooting yourself in the foot doing that.
3005.7200000000003,3006.7200000000003," Right, you know."
3006.7200000000003,3011.52," So for the listeners that wonder what they could do, I think one, obviously, would"
3011.52,3018.44, be to don't become a raving zeal at yourself when it comes to scores and demanding
3018.44,3022.92," people's heads on pikes because they give games, they give Zelda 8.8."
3022.92,3024.6000000000004," You know, that's definitely one thing."
3024.6,3031.2," Another would be to support the sorts of content that goes beyond, hey, we got the first"
3031.2,3035.6," look, we got the exclusive look at this, we got a new bullet point to add to the list of"
3035.6,3037.04, features of this game.
3037.04,3040.68," But hey, here's a story that we have to have an audience for that."
3040.68,3045.72," If you, you know, we talk about those kind of stories and how they are, they still do rely"
3045.72,3049.72," on cooperation of a publisher and stuff, but they're far less so than any of the other"
3049.72,3050.72, crap.
3050.72,3056.9599999999996," And like, I think demand that don't just sit there, we're hitting refresh on a website"
3056.9599999999996,3061.7599999999998," every five seconds hoping to get that extra bullet point about a new weapon, you know, or"
3061.7599999999998,3065.04, a new vehicle that's been announced in the game.
3065.04,3068.9599999999996," And I mean, you've got to want, you've got to help us, you know, we want that we want"
3068.9599999999996,3073.3199999999997," to do certain things, but it's like, if the audience doesn't want it, publishers don't want"
3073.3199999999997,3078.24," it, then everyone's going to end up writing them happy, happy press releases called"
3078.24,3079.24, pre-use.
3080.24,3083.3999999999996," I'll keep reading your story, Sean, because I'm paid to."
3085.3999999999996,3088.04, We'll be paid to our boss writing around.
3088.04,3090.3999999999996, We'll read some other stuff on this note.
3090.3999999999996,3091.3999999999996, We did.
3091.3999999999996,3095.7599999999998," I do want to pivot that Robert Ashley and I wrote, Robert wrote it and I helped with some"
3095.7599999999998,3100.72," their reporting story that's on gumma sutra about, I guess if you just put our names"
3100.72,3105.16," in gumma sutra.com and your Google engine, you'll find the story."
3106.04,3109.64," It's basically about a lot of the things that we've been talking about, but in greater"
3109.64,3113.24, depth and with a lot of input from people that actually work in PR.
3113.24,3117.8399999999997," At the time, you know, I tried to spread awareness for it on message boards and people"
3117.8399999999997,3120.7599999999998," are like, well, okay, so the game industry's corrupt."
3120.7599999999998,3124.44," This is supposed to be new because it was like absolutely missing the point, right?"
3124.44,3125.44, They clearly didn't read it.
3125.44,3127.3199999999997," It was like, well, it's not necessarily saying it's corrupt."
3127.3199999999997,3132.64," It's saying there are some ways and subtleties to the, you know, to the, to the workings of"
3132.64,3134.3199999999997, the industry that you might not be aware of.
3134.3199999999997,3140.8799999999997, We want to make you aware of them and to see how potentially when things could go wrong
3140.8799999999997,3142.2, and make it corrupt.
3142.2,3143.2, Yeah.
3143.2,3144.2," And, you know, what's necessary?"
3144.2,3147.2, And also like that outlining the part of the reader to do something else in it.
3147.2,3148.8799999999997," And so, yeah, this is a stand by the story."
3148.8799999999997,3154.08," I think it was an excellent, excellent piece and I would like more people to read it."
3154.08,3155.08, Yeah.
3155.08,3162.08," To me, it's like the scariest thing about like the mergers and the growing gigantic companies"
3162.08,3169.6, is just like it puts more power in the hands of fewer companies to potentially have an
3169.6,3173.68, influence on editorial direction by withholding money.
3173.68,3177.18," You know, this is something that's really, really changed over the last 10 years in this"
3177.18,3178.18, industry.
3178.18,3183.72," When it was all small companies, you know, even if the ads were all related to gaming,"
3183.72,3188.56, one little company getting mad that they got a bad score could not really have this kind
3188.56,3190.04, of influence.
3190.04,3201.64," But now if you've got, you know, active blizzard vision with $8 billion worth of revenue"
3201.64,3206.12," hovering over you, you know, the pressure is definitely there on the advertising side."
3206.12,3207.12, Yeah.
3207.12,3208.12," So, let's hit that."
3208.12,3210.32, Which was my long-winded way of making that transition.
3210.32,3211.32," That's part, yeah."
3211.32,3213.32," Consolidation is a, right."
3213.32,3214.32, Right.
3214.32,3215.32, And a lot of these days.
3215.32,3216.32, Right.
3216.32,3226.84," Because the Vendee Games acquired 52% of activation over the weekend on Sunday, it was announced."
3226.84,3231.0800000000004, And the Vendee Games is comprised of a few studios.
3231.0800000000004,3234.44, One of which is Blizzard.
3234.44,3238.8," So really, this, this is a merger of the Vendee Games and Activision."
3238.8,3245.32, And it's being called the very clever Activision Blizzard is the name.
3245.36,3249.1600000000003," Really, if, if you're wondering what that all means, you should really just substitute out"
3249.1600000000003,3252.56, the name Blizzard and put in Vendee because that's what it is.
3252.56,3254.84, Activision and Vendee merged.
3254.84,3260.4," It's just that because Vendee has this very, very nice crown jewel called Blizzard in it"
3260.4,3263.56, that they sort of promoted that brand name up to the top.
3263.56,3264.56, Right.
3264.56,3268.1200000000003, So it's Activision Blizzard.
3268.1200000000003,3275.0800000000004," And I, I talked to Mike Morhing the CEO over the weekend on Sunday and CEO of Blizzard."
3275.12,3276.08, Thank you.
3276.08,3283.48, And he basically reiterated what's up on Blizzard website and what we're seeing everywhere
3283.48,3291.56," else in the media, which is that it's mostly just a, this is a corporate thing that is probably"
3291.56,3297.52," not, at least they're all saying it's not going to affect the bottom line for gamers at"
3297.52,3304.2," all that Blizzard for one, I mean, for one thing, Activision didn't buy Blizzard."
3304.2,3306.12, That's one thing that's going around.
3306.12,3313.1," There's not going to be, you know, orcs on skateboards in the next Tony Hawk or vice versa,"
3313.1,3316.4399999999996, Tony Hawk's not going to be skateboarding around and Azeroth.
3316.4399999999996,3319.64," You know, these are separate, there's separate entities still."
3319.64,3323.9199999999996," And if anybody owns anybody, it's Vendee on Activision, not the other way around."
3323.9199999999996,3327.96," So you come this to better opportunity because I've heard that before, that would be"
3327.96,3329.7999999999997, shrake in World Warcraft.
3329.7999999999997,3330.7999999999997, Oh yeah.
3330.7999999999997,3331.7999999999997, Hmm.
3331.7999999999997,3332.7999999999997, Instead would make a little more.
3332.8,3338.4," Also like all the names, I really like, act hard, a black, hard, a black division,"
3338.4,3340.6800000000003," black division, active division."
3340.6800000000003,3342.6800000000003, You should do it in the future when they were deciding.
3342.6800000000003,3343.6800000000003, Yeah.
3343.6800000000003,3347.0," That's kind of get old like we jokes because, because Activision Blizzard, it's after we've"
3347.0,3348.0, done to.
3348.0,3349.0," Yeah, they're done already."
3349.0,3353.4, They're not funny yesterday already.
3353.4,3359.6000000000004," And most important, you know, this new name Activision Blizzard is not going to show up"
3359.68,3366.4," on any Gameboxes anywhere on Blizzard products, on the Vendee products or on Activision"
3366.4,3367.4, Products.
3367.4,3371.36," You know, it's as basically just acknowledging that name Activision Blizzard is a"
3371.36,3376.3199999999997," acknowledging that all the games from Activision, their whole stable games and all the"
3376.3199999999997,3381.8399999999997," games from Vendee, which includes Blizzard are now controlled by one big company."
3381.8399999999997,3382.8399999999997, Right.
3382.8399999999997,3387.16," But Blizzard itself, Blizzard Entertainment is a publishing label."
3387.16,3390.16, The only games that are going to be on that publishing label with the name Blizzard
3390.16,3392.44, on them are games that Blizzard makes.
3392.44,3393.44, Okay.
3393.44,3394.44, Right.
3394.44,3395.96, I would not care about a logo change.
3395.96,3402.08," I mean, who gives a crap, but I would be more concerned if there were definite repercussions"
3402.08,3404.56, for like how Blizzard operates that comes out of this.
3404.56,3405.7999999999997," And I don't think there are, right?"
3405.7999999999997,3406.7999999999997, There are.
3406.7999999999997,3407.7999999999997, Right.
3407.7999999999997,3410.52," I mean, they're saying it's completely business as usual for them."
3410.52,3415.3999999999996," So, the main, the most, the only really thing that happened here for Blizzard is that"
3415.4,3418.88, they got their name elevated to a higher level.
3418.88,3424.96," That's the only reason Blizzard is even coming up in the story, which is just Vendee"
3424.96,3430.8," just acknowledged, hey, this is the most high profile name and within the name with the"
3430.8,3432.32, best reputation.
3432.32,3438.28, And so they're able to use this event as a way of rebranding the whole thing.
3438.28,3439.6800000000003," So, there you go."
3439.6800000000003,3440.6800000000003, Am I borrowing it at Earth?
3440.6800000000003,3441.6800000000003, No.
3441.6800000000003,3442.6800000000003, No.
3442.6800000000003,3443.6800000000003, No.
3443.7599999999998,3448.04," And just related to the other story, the only reason I even think we could take"
3448.04,3453.6," it as bad news is just, yeah, you know, the more everybody merges and becomes one giant"
3453.6,3461.04," active blision, EA, UBI.com, the less, you know, it just worries me."
3461.04,3462.04, Right.
3462.04,3465.6," On the last big one was about EA, Pyrower."
3465.6,3466.6, That was just a great thing.
3466.6,3469.04, Because it caused a lot of worry too.
3469.04,3472.2799999999997," So who knows, right?"
3472.2799999999997,3474.72, consolidation time.
3474.72,3477.6," That's happening everything with media that covers games too, though."
3477.6,3479.12," You know, yeah, for sure."
3479.12,3480.8, And they're all owned by.
3480.8,3481.8, Right.
3481.8,3482.8, Three companies.
3482.8,3484.8, Who the hell even owns us at this point?
3484.8,3485.8, Yeah.
3485.8,3486.8, Donald.
3486.8,3487.8, I don't know.
3487.8,3489.8," On that, for the."
3489.8,3490.8, I agree.
3490.8,3491.8, I'm so beat-o-t-t.
3491.8,3496.8, How are we doing on time there?
3496.8,3498.84, We've got 10 minutes.
3498.84,3501.6000000000004, We haven't even talked about games that we love this week.
3501.6000000000004,3505.1600000000003," Well, I was gonna say this was the rant of attending to find some way to transition"
3505.1600000000003,3508.76, and talk about Unreal Termat 3 in soldier fortune.
3508.76,3511.6800000000003," This is going to be happy, talk, though."
3511.6800000000003,3512.6800000000003, Not really.
3512.6800000000003,3514.76," I mean, do we need happy talk?"
3514.76,3515.76, No.
3515.76,3516.76, This is going to be awesome.
3516.76,3517.76," Are you, are you?"
3517.76,3518.76, I can't.
3518.76,3519.76, I might edit and she'll tell me I can only say good things.
3519.76,3524.04," Sean, please say something positive about our games, about the games we cover so that"
3524.04,3525.84, the advertisers will like us.
3525.84,3529.6800000000003, The bad about UT3 isn't necessarily the game is doing.
3529.6800000000003,3533.84, It's probably connected to a bot is just said it doesn't.
3533.84,3536.4, Nothing is indicating to me that it's doing very well.
3536.4,3537.96, That's selling well.
3537.96,3542.6400000000003," And the only thing, my only judge for that is, online discussion, but more importantly,"
3542.6400000000003,3546.2400000000002, number of active servers.
3546.2400000000002,3550.4," So hey, a lot of people could be playing offline with bots."
3550.4,3553.48," I mean, they've always said that a lot of, that's how a lot of people play it."
3553.48,3554.48," So I'm people prefer it, though."
3554.56,3556.52, So people prefer it that way.
3556.52,3558.92, Others like myself don't.
3558.92,3567.48," But I know that for online, right now, I've, facts from a very few different sources"
3567.48,3572.76," in one is basically game, spies, server, stuff, information."
3572.76,3579.08," As of like, sometimes yesterday at peak, it sounds like that, while 385 people were playing"
3579.08,3584.52," flat out two, which is the racing game, sort of hillbilly racing game."
3584.52,3588.7999999999997, There were 282 people playing Unreal tournament three.
3588.7999999999997,3589.7999999999997," Oh, God."
3589.7999999999997,3594.16," However, this morning when I looked on, when you look at gametracker.com, which is actually"
3594.16,3599.2," really interesting site, you can look at every server online for every major multiplayer"
3599.2,3603.6, PC game at any given moment and see how many people are playing.
3603.6,3606.2," When I looked before we taped, I sent you the link, Jeff."
3606.2799999999997,3611.6," Yeah, like there were about 40 people playing online on Unreal tournament three."
3611.6,3616.3599999999997," And when you compare that to soldier of fortune payback, actually, had hundreds of people"
3616.3599999999997,3617.3599999999997, playing.
3617.3599999999997,3620.2799999999997, So they actually had quite a few more people playing many more of the Germany.
3620.2799999999997,3621.2799999999997," Yes, 40 people."
3621.2799999999997,3624.3199999999997," Okay, so everybody's a school in work that during the day."
3624.3199999999997,3625.64, So this is global too.
3625.64,3630.12," Well, so this is servers in Australia, UK, Germany, all these other, like crucial"
3630.12,3631.12, holidays.
3631.12,3632.12," That is, like 40 people worldwide."
3632.12,3633.12, It is unbelievable.
3633.12,3634.12, We're playing Unreal tournament.
3634.12,3636.12," Yeah, that means they're like more people."
3636.12,3637.3599999999997, People listening to this podcast.
3637.3599999999997,3643.8399999999997," But like two, like three or four, we need the prices right."
3643.8399999999997,3644.8399999999997, Loser music there.
3644.8399999999997,3647.48, And it was really sad to look at a few things on there.
3647.48,3651.24," Like when I looked at fortress forever, it's just the mod that just came out."
3651.24,3657.72, And it's basically a more classic take on team fortress than team fortress two.
3657.72,3660.96, And they were about like eight people playing that.
3660.96,3662.92, They were two occupied servers.
3662.92,3666.6, And that's really sad considering that it took like at least two years to make that
3666.6,3669.52, insurgency is another big mod that came out.
3669.52,3672.8, And there weren't very many people playing that.
3672.8,3676.8," Meanwhile, team fortress two, called duty four are absolutely packed."
3676.8,3677.8, Yeah.
3677.8,3680.36," All of this, the usual day to feed source and the other strike source."
3680.36,3682.76, But COD4 and team fortress two are loaded.
3682.76,3684.96, Page after page of populated servers.
3684.96,3685.96, Right.
3685.96,3688.16, And we knew that would have a ripple effect on all these other games.
3688.16,3689.16, Right.
3689.16,3690.16, And those are right.
3690.16,3691.16, And those are right.
3691.16,3692.16, Those are quite useful.
3692.16,3693.16, Yeah.
3693.16,3694.16, And exact same position.
3694.16,3696.52, It was actually looked like it was like fewer people were playing the Unreal
3696.52,3697.52, tournament three.
3697.52,3698.52, Right.
3698.52,3700.52, Of course that's that's build much more as a single player game anyway.
3700.52,3701.52, Exactly.
3701.52,3702.52, Unreal tournament three though.
3702.52,3703.8399999999997," I mean, this is that's bad."
3703.8399999999997,3704.8399999999997, Yeah.
3704.8399999999997,3710.68," And the thing is, is I can like sympathize with it because I've been playing it."
3710.68,3712.08, I just don't like the game.
3712.08,3716.16, I always I can play for about 10 to 15 minutes and then I always want to just turn it
3716.16,3717.16, off.
3717.16,3720.0, And I just don't it's not very entertaining to me.
3720.0,3721.0, I don't like it.
3721.08,3722.4, Despite I really want to.
3722.4,3724.92," I mean, you get in and sometimes certain things look so great."
3724.92,3728.92," You know, I was playing a vehicle CTF in this map called Sandstorm."
3728.92,3733.76," And with all the technical neckers vehicles flying around and you know, actual sandstorms"
3733.76,3737.24," ripped through it and they've got headlights that are like, you know, kind of like blazing"
3737.24,3738.24, through there.
3738.24,3742.76," And so much stuff is going on and they got this, this fantastic if, you know, like battlefield"
3742.76,3744.32, to even look anything like this.
3744.32,3746.2," God, I would have been like, go crazy."
3746.2,3747.2, Mm-hmm.
3747.2,3750.12, Then you just play it and like this game is just a spaz fest.
3750.12,3751.7999999999997," You know, it's just nonsense."
3751.7999999999997,3754.8399999999997," So really you could take, you could take your comments."
3754.8399999999997,3756.16, You could reverse them.
3756.16,3759.3599999999997, And then you could actually have that exact review text you were quoting earlier.
3759.3599999999997,3760.3599999999997, Good.
3760.3599999999997,3761.3599999999997, You could say.
3761.3599999999997,3763.12, But this game is a complete spaz fest.
3763.12,3764.72," However, man, it looks great."
3764.72,3767.72," It does look very, very nice."
3767.72,3768.72, That's all I see.
3768.72,3773.72," And yeah, that's."
3773.72,3775.44," But it's like, I think the demo was out there."
3775.44,3777.44, And that was the same impression I got from the demo.
3777.44,3780.16," You know, it's like I wouldn't want it to buy it based on the demo."
3780.16,3784.48, And I don't know if people are concerned about if the problem is that they're worried
3784.48,3786.84, about how much hardware it takes to run it.
3786.84,3789.68," But again, though, Unreal Engine 3 is very scalable."
3789.68,3795.04, You can strip that game down to nothing but just like basically untextured polys
3795.04,3796.04, and play.
3796.04,3799.12," And a lot of people do play this unreal games that way anyway, because they want the performance"
3799.12,3800.68, over the appearance.
3800.68,3801.68, Right.
3801.68,3804.92," So I don't know if that's, I don't know how I feel about that excuse."
3804.92,3809.56, I don't think that the technology is as much of an impediment in an entry barrier
3809.56,3815.6, as you can make it out to be as it would be a cry clearly is of crisis.
3815.6,3819.2400000000002," But yeah, I did talk a little bit about that game last time we recorded so."
3819.2400000000002,3825.6," I don't even say that much more other than that it's just very, I don't know."
3825.6,3828.8, It's very unsatisfactory to play.
3828.8,3833.96, But soldier fortune payback is interesting because there are more people playing in
3834.0,3837.28, Europe online that play.
3837.28,3842.28," That game, I just say something about it's like, you kind of go in expecting not so much"
3842.28,3844.08," because it's labeled a value game, right?"
3844.08,3845.08, It's labeled a budget game.
3845.08,3847.44, And then that was making me think about some other stuff too.
3847.44,3849.92," I was like, hey, I'm looking around and reviews for this."
3849.92,3853.32," Everyone's being really critical of this is getting low scores well below five,"
3853.32,3855.92, even for sites that their average is a seven or an eight.
3855.92,3862.76," And I was quite wondering, I was like, hey, is labeling it a budget game kind of"
3862.76,3864.5600000000004," the publisher's way of saying like, it's okay."
3864.5600000000004,3865.2400000000002, We understand.
3865.2400000000002,3868.88," You can, you could say you can write a real review with this one."
3868.88,3870.2000000000003," I think in a lot of cases, you know,"
3870.2000000000003,3872.0400000000004," Sir way of saying, please don't review this."
3872.0400000000004,3873.32," It is, it is that too."
3873.32,3874.8, You don't get their saying code.
3874.8,3877.0," Yeah, they're saying, don't, this isn't for you guys."
3877.0,3881.5600000000004," So I don't want to get the, you know, the order of operations mixed up here and say that,"
3881.5600000000004,3885.32," like, oh, well, people are extra harsh on budget games, but because of course,"
3885.32,3888.92," they're often budget games because, right, they suck, you know."
3889.16,3894.96," But in cases like, I found that area 51 and soldier fortune, if you take away two crucial"
3894.96,3900.12," elements, you take away the, the temps to work the narrative into area 51 and you take"
3900.12,3904.16," out the gratuitous score, which you actually can do with an option in soldier fortune."
3904.16,3906.32, They're basically the same game.
3906.32,3910.2000000000003," They're the same, just completely mediocre, templated game."
3910.2000000000003,3917.84," And I was like, hey, why, but then area 51's got all the sevens and six, fives and stuff."
3917.84,3919.6000000000004," And this is the one on the same side, it's getting lower."
3919.6000000000004,3920.6000000000004, And I kind of wondered about that.
3920.6000000000004,3925.6800000000003," What does an area 51 have a little bit more, I could be one, but a little bit more of an"
3925.6800000000003,3927.28, interesting story.
3927.28,3928.28, That's what I was saying.
3928.28,3929.28, Right.
3929.28,3930.28, The story is kind of there.
3930.28,3934.56," I don't think that the story, I think it's interesting to look at the fact that"
3934.56,3940.4, someone attempted to make a AAA mass market game with the story as diverse as this.
3940.4,3941.4, Right.
3941.4,3943.4, I'm not saying I think that the story is especially successful.
3943.4,3944.4, Right.
3944.4,3945.4, It's an interesting story.
3945.4,3946.4, Right.
3946.56,3951.56," But I mean, it's not enough to when you're done playing the game while you think"
3951.56,3955.64," about the story, it's not enough to say, okay, this game sucked, that story was good."
3955.64,3957.04, You shouldn't play it for the story.
3957.04,3958.04, Right.
3958.04,3959.04, It shouldn't play it.
3959.04,3960.04, No.
3960.04,3966.36," And soldier fortune, I mean, it's very much the same game where you know, you enemies pop"
3966.36,3971.6," up from scripted locations, which is normal, but they always run at the same points."
3971.6,3973.1600000000003," If you die, they'll do it again and again."
3973.1600000000003,3976.08," And then when you do anything unpredictable, they're never able to react to it."
3976.08,3979.68," So say, you know, they're going to jump out of a window and run over to this part in"
3979.68,3980.68, the street.
3980.68,3984.12," If you continue to walk past them, they're going to just stay there in the street because"
3984.12,3988.0, that's the end of the line that they can go no further than that.
3988.0,3993.6," But so soldier fortune will do a few, it'll do a few things where it's kind of like,"
3993.6,3995.68," hey, let's let's put the equivalent of a boss in here."
3995.68,3997.68, But this is supposed to be a very realistic game.
3997.68,3998.68," You know, it's real world game."
3998.68,3999.68, You're an Afghanistan.
3999.68,4000.68, You're in various parts of the Middle East.
4000.68,4002.84, Go throughout Southeast Asia.
4003.76,4009.52," And you'll have inexplicably, though, you'll have, okay, this is like the chief"
4009.52,4010.36, terrorist.
4010.36,4014.96, And that in their world means that he's basically got eight to ten times the hit points
4014.96,4015.96, is the other guys.
4015.96,4019.52," And the other guys, their heads explode in the gory mess when you hit him with one bullet."
4019.52,4023.1600000000003," And suddenly, here's this guy that, you know, it's not, he doesn't have a helmet on."
4023.1600000000003,4025.84," He's not wearing, you know, a flat jacket or anything."
4025.84,4026.84," Yeah, but he's a boss."
4026.84,4028.08, But you got to shoot this guy.
4028.08,4029.6000000000004," Yeah, you got to shoot this guy forever."
4029.6000000000004,4031.08, Why don't you get that?
4031.24,4033.7599999999998," And then both of them, too, they both loved exploding barrels."
4033.7599999999998,4037.56," It's like that's always the sign where, I mean, like, in one mission, you're up in"
4037.56,4038.2, these mountains.
4038.2,4042.84," And there's all these, you know, catapult, uh, uh, plank walkways and stuff."
4043.48,4046.72," And put up there, there's just barrels and dude's hiding behind them."
4046.72,4050.24," So it's like they, they erected these elaborate, you know, rope bridges and all the stuff."
4050.24,4052.48, Just so they could then bring the barrels up there with them.
4052.48,4057.12," And then chill, it is very convenient of all those bad guys and all those games"
4057.12,4059.3199999999997, to bring those to have flammable barrels.
4059.4,4063.56," So it's like, I pointed on that because that's now like, just that's just the token sign"
4063.56,4066.28," of, okay, you're just making this game by that you got this book."
4066.28,4070.36," You got like how to make an FPS for dummies or, you know, and there's like the chat"
4070.36,4071.36, I never would like.
4071.36,4075.2400000000002, Players love to feel in control of their empowered in their environment by causing
4075.2400000000002,4076.92, explosions and other other stuff.
4076.92,4081.88," But don't be afraid to throw, you know, customizable barrels wherever you want."
4081.88,4084.88, So then you see the guy up on the top of the mountain and then he's just up there alone
4084.88,4085.88, with the barrel.
4085.88,4086.88, They dropped it.
4086.96,4090.56, It brought a helicopter in and dropped that thing on one exploding barrel.
4090.56,4091.88, Much of hot in the end of this.
4091.88,4096.04," You just sit in there and then, of course, like if you're ever like somewhere and you're"
4096.04,4100.84," not by a barrel, you're, you're, your key thing should be to run toward one, you know,"
4100.84,4102.56, and some of it gets ridiculous like that.
4102.56,4108.08," But the thing about this game is that it builds itself as, I mean, you know, one of the"
4108.08,4112.08," key, you know, box pull out some of the things that they've, you know, made a great, they"
4112.08,4115.400000000001, brought a great deal of attention to in the promotional materials and their websites
4115.4,4117.639999999999," stuff is how gory it is, right?"
4117.639999999999,4122.12," I mean, like in my review, I compared it to human bodies in this game, what trees are"
4122.12,4125.839999999999," to crisis where you hit someone at the point of impact, the limb comes off."
4125.839999999999,4127.12, Gorsc squirts out.
4127.12,4130.839999999999," They continue to bleed if you take off the foot, they'll just drag themselves around and"
4130.839999999999,4131.839999999999, they'll still fight.
4131.839999999999,4136.599999999999," And so you're then encouraged to go up and deliver the coup de grante, shoot your face"
4136.599999999999,4138.0, off in in Mangalum.
4138.0,4141.92," If there's bottles, bodies pile up, you throw a grenade in them and the chunks of gorge"
4141.92,4143.719999999999, just paint the environment and they go everywhere.
4143.8,4144.72," Oh, actually."
4144.72,4148.2," I mean, that's always been a staple of the series, you know, I mean, this has always been"
4148.2,4150.360000000001, the thing about soldier fortune.
4150.360000000001,4152.8," And the thing is, this is the timing now."
4152.8,4157.04," And I was thinking about that is that now, I mean, since salt and the terrace, you're"
4157.04,4160.52," going all these places that we understand, like, oh, this is very much like canned harr."
4160.52,4165.92," Something, you know, it's like I'm reacting differently to it, you know, I mean, you"
4165.92,4168.84," make the apps like, sorry, I'm getting the wrap up thing, so I got to wrap this"
4168.84,4169.84, up.
4169.84,4171.84, But they have pocket and we're done.
4171.84,4173.84, I don't know.
4173.84,4177.84," I always talk about gamesmen and fuck me for one, the talk about games."
4177.84,4179.84," It's a fuck you for talking about games, John."
4179.84,4181.84, Don't you know what this is?
