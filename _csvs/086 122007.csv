37.92,47.040000000000006," I've come here to chew bubble gum and podcast, and I am all out of gum. How's that?"
48.88,54.24," Second, that was me as Duke Nuke. That was you as Arnold's fortune. That was you."
54.24,60.88, That was me. Oh my god. I totally full-shot in the law. I knew it. I knew I'd get somebody.
61.6,68.48, This is Duke Nuke as Arnold as Jeff Green in CFW Radio. I almost said CGW again.
68.48,73.76," Or 9.75, the Brodio. I'm here with the original All-Star Cast."
75.6,76.96000000000001, Introduce yourselves. Please.
78.16,82.64," Starting over there. Sean Malois, menstrual blood magic."
85.19999999999999,92.8," Today is your video name. Sean Elliott. Ryan Scott. And back from the dead, Daring"
92.8,99.36, Gladstone. Welcome back from the dead. You live in corpse you. Maximum chill. Dr. Maximum
99.36,105.36," chill is not with us. Is it Dr. No? Yeah, to me he is. It's on a rift. You're my doctor of love."
105.36,111.75999999999999, Where is he? Where is Max Joe? He's out doing Christmas preparations before he flies to Texas tomorrow.
111.76,117.84, That's a fun show. He's going to Texas. Okay. So I stole the Cowboys flag office in 10 and he's trying to find it.
121.44,127.92, Just get some stilets. So I did that. Yuck filled a topical opening sentence because
128.88,135.36, because it was the big day. We had 25 hours of hype about Duke Nuke and forever. So the whole internet
135.36,139.36," blew up yesterday. Oh my god, it's happens. Everybody here at one up was like, oh my god,"
139.52,145.52," can we do a Duke cover? Oh, wow. So then it came out this morning and what did everybody think?"
147.52,150.88000000000002, Transition. Yeah.
152.16000000000003,156.88000000000002, To implication really. I don't know if it deserves a wet fart about that trailer.
158.56,163.28000000000003, Do the Duke. It was a teaser trailer. It was a commercial. It looks exactly like what you'd
163.28000000000003,168.64000000000001, expect if like if the the basic assumption about Duke Nuke is that it was doomed with the
168.72,173.51999999999998, pal- a few pal- swaps and then some like cheesy one liners thrown over the top of it.
173.51999999999998,179.2," Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then that take that into, you know, 2007 and you basically have a Doom 3 or"
179.2,186.16," pray. What? Yeah. Character model swap was right. Boys, boys, clips thrown over it. Judging from"
186.16,190.16," what's on the video, I don't know. I think that's all there is to say. I think most people at this"
190.16,196.48," point are reacting to their nostalgia and in the same way that, you know, people swear that"
196.56,201.44, CGW was so wonderful in these years. That EGM was the best in the years and then you go back and
201.44,205.76," you look at those years and it was basically a bunch of screenshots and some sort of, you know,"
207.35999999999999,212.32," pseudo-babbling and but it's like, you know, that's you remember that from when you were a kid and it"
212.32,218.07999999999998," it was cool. It's coming back and it's the reason to say it again. I'm gonna say. Yeah, I don't get this"
218.07999999999998,222.79999999999998," games that feel whatsoever. Never, ever, ever got the first time around. No, never. I'm"
222.8,228.32000000000002," actually going to join you, Mr. Malay, and saying I was also not in the Duke camp. I did not"
228.32000000000002,233.60000000000002, understand that games appeal at the time. I'm sorry if I'm offending certain listeners. I was not in the Duke
233.60000000000002,237.36, camp. The only thing I dug about at the first time around was the interactivity. That was probably one of
237.36,241.28," the first games that let you do all sorts of stuff in the in the game in the world. Okay, now that is"
241.28,246.0," it, that is the common meme. No way, you're right. The third time around. You're talking about"
246.0,250.88000000000002," do you do like a 3D 3D. Okay, but the first time we're such a activity other than like you could flush"
250.96,254.79999999999998," the toilet. You could actually, they had ball physics, and you could shoot pool. You could actually"
254.79999999999998,261.04," shoot right. Okay, but see like all that's just my day. That was like tech demo stuff that didn't"
261.04,265.04," actually affect the game. It didn't at all. Like half, well like we're at least in half life. You're"
265.04,270.8," talking about like the gravity guy. I agree. So that even back then, I was like, I was all excited"
270.8,274.4," at, you know, when I heard about it. Wow, you can interact with the world. I'm like, do where"
274.4,279.04," it's all just sort of like painted walls or whatever. I can interact with Duke, you know, I could"
279.04,284.8," be Duke and interact with the world. And then I was like, I can flush the toilet. Okay. Yeah."
284.8,289.76000000000005," Anyway, well, maybe there's a game I could play. Yeah, it was stupid. It didn't contribute to the"
289.76000000000005,292.72," game at all, but I mean, I'm just saying like back then through the eyes of God, how old was I"
292.72,297.12," when I was playing it? You know, it was defective. I mean, yeah, it was different. But of course,"
297.12,300.88, that's what they chose to do with the interactivity. What sort of says something about? True.
300.88,305.12," For today's market, it really is a matter of like the same reason that we have transformers,"
306.08,311.6, live action films this year. The reason the same reason that blood bowls announced that Area 51
312.16,316.96, is Area 51 and not some other sci-fi shooter with a different name every time it comes out.
317.52,321.2," And you know, like it sounds cynical and sounds obvious when you put it in that context. She's like,"
321.2,327.68," hey, who is ever so in love with their E51 like in game that they were guaranteed sell on a version"
327.68,331.44," that has more or less nothing to do with it that comes out this year, right? But then when it's Duke"
331.52,336.0," Newcomen, it happens or transformers and it's something that was especially prominent in your youth"
336.0,340.88," and your experience, then all of a sudden the allure is there. And I think that that's part of what is"
340.88,345.76," there. The other thing is that maybe the time a lot of people were sort of like responding to, you know,"
345.76,352.88," when the American flag pops up at the end and the thing, but that's not the point though. I think even then"
353.44,360.8," it was okay, you know, whatever late 80s, early 90s, people around, I mean, you know, Rambo's"
360.8,365.52000000000004," 80s, but you know, and the Schwarzenegger Flicks, I'm looking at this is like, okay, for sure this is the"
365.52000000000004,369.36," fall of Western civilization, right? This is late stage capitalism and it's on like the fast track to"
369.36,374.24, hell. So let's let's parody it and like look at just a while ridiculous everything's gotten.
374.24,378.0," People were, this is also an era in which people were wearing shirts to school that said like"
378.0,383.2," kill them all, let God sort them out, right? And it's sort of right. It's going to happen that"
383.92,389.52, mentality out Ryan still is. That's where I guess you're doing. That's just tag in many first
389.52,397.2, person shooters too. So the thing for me now is that if they take what made it work then and they
397.2,402.48," just remake it and they play it straight. Yeah, which I have no, I don't think the trailer is enough"
402.48,408.08," to indicate one way or the other, but if they do, I think that's going to not work because look at,"
408.08,412.15999999999997," okay, so if that was supposed to pretend the fall of Western civilization, look what's happened in"
412.24,418.24," the 15, 20 years since then. Now we're so fucked up that Duke Nukem talking about chewing"
418.24,424.48," bubble gum and kicking ass is sounds like something Bart Simpson would say, right? So now instead of"
424.48,431.84000000000003," that they have to have like, I came to eat fruit by the foot and watch German, Shaisamovies and"
431.84000000000003,438.56," you guys and I'm a lot of fruit by the foot and German. You know, like they have to do something"
438.64,442.88, I'm going to ramp it up and to respond to today's environment. What made it that much more
442.88,448.08, than they're going to make it. I'm like ironic commentary on what Duke used to be. I think they're
448.08,452.56, going to play it straight. Don't you? They probably are. That's Sally's that we're not going to
452.56,458.4, hear like squealing Steve Vy sounding and Tar's thrown in at random moments. Like that would be
458.4,462.72, so rather like safe you're in a big fight and there's no music just ambient sound effects. Then
462.72,466.24," when it's done and you're just walking down a random hall for a key, then it just plays some"
466.32,470.8, random. I absolutely do not think they're going to make that parody of that would be too far.
470.8,476.0," I mean, the trailer we saw had that like cheesy like generic metal music in it, which I don't"
476.0,480.40000000000003," think they were playing for laughs. You know, like Duke is pumping iron in between the little"
480.40000000000003,485.2, two second shots of gameplay and you're just hearing that that hair metal shit. I think you were supposed
485.2,492.72," to go, yeah, back. I don't know. What's funny is, we were joking about it as possible. It is because"
492.72,498.0," they're looking at the mirror. They do when they may do. That's pretty much who they were, right?"
498.8,504.72," Yes, they had the hair and they liked the metal and the whole, you know, demons and shit and"
504.72,508.8, that's like this. How do we do that? What do we do to get better than they got demons and they got
508.8,512.64, it blows about how we're going to beat that. You haven't shit down their fucking throat after you
512.64,518.64," killed the demon. And then you got the nuke, right? By the way, it's being a bit of what was the"
518.64,524.56," tagline at the end? Can anyone remember? It was something like, I need to park a brick."
524.56,529.92," Wait, I need to tell. I need to, I need to toilet to park my brick. Who's first?"
529.92,534.56," The alien toilet. My brick, something like that. Because they're fucking hit all of that."
534.56,538.48, I don't know what a new man. I have to hear it five times and I didn't get it.
540.48,544.8," You know what, I think, yeah, I think they should go back to the side scrolling to"
545.68,552.0799999999999," had be awesome. Why, dude? Why don't we get a kick your ass off to the retranot?"
552.0799999999999,556.9599999999999, Because those guys are too forever. Those games were rad.
556.9599999999999,563.92, Then they went all 3D. First person. He screwed it all 3D. Everything was better. We shouldn't be.
563.92,568.0, I should tell them to do a retranot. I got youngest old man at the property.
568.0,570.88," You work on it, right? You also have to kind of put ourselves to like figure out what"
570.88,575.28, is going to be. Put ourselves in the shoes of someone who's been working on this game for 10 years.
575.28,579.76," Yeah, to like figure out like still listening to Andrew Deskley. What has transformed in their"
579.76,584.8," head are they just like, are they mad? Are they insane? Are they just right? What would that"
584.8,587.4399999999999," do? That's what I wanted. That's why when that trailer came out, that's what I'm asking"
587.4399999999999,592.08," about that last line. It was like, you had how many years to come out with a trailer and you"
592.08,596.64," ended on that line? Which is just like, huh? That's what I'm saying. They need like Garth"
596.64,601.04, and it's for someone to do lines. He's got that one character who's sort of like this
601.04,606.56," Arab militia dude and he's always talking about like, I swat you like the flies that buzz around"
606.56,611.92," my cockhead. You can't like swear right? I mean, they can get guys like that in there."
611.92,615.92," They could have like Duke, Duke should be driving. Have you seen Eddie Ocarcine, the police cars?"
615.92,619.92," Yeah, no, I want to. He should be driving one of those things. It's like a little tiny S car,"
619.92,624.88," but it's got like, you know, like tribal banding around it and then like the police logo looks like"
624.88,630.32," it was from a big dog shirt from Walmart or something. Yes, he took this game that over the top"
630.32,635.2," and made him that over the top. Yeah, it could be fun. But it would be, yeah, that's what we're saying."
635.2,639.52," Just don't play it straight and don't play it like, hey guys, we know you have so many"
639.52,643.68," expectations about Duke, Nukem. What we need to do is live up to these expectations. This is"
643.68,647.92," you can understand much is the way that people who've made movies like, you know, film adaptations"
647.92,653.6," of Harry Potter, right? Or all these other popular franchises, we have, you know, all these"
653.76,657.36, new fans to please and we have this legacy that we have to remain true to. It's like there's no
657.36,663.0400000000001, fucking legacy of a group of a group of offlines from Bruce Campbell or whatever. Right. So they should
663.0400000000001,668.48," go completely go for it and then it could be actually good. And I don't believe, well, I'm not going to say"
668.48,673.12," that. Don't. I think the first time or so I'm giving the vibe for the second, so clip. So no,"
673.12,677.84," you're right. Yeah, we can't believe. But that clip didn't make me think what I'm trying to say is that"
677.9200000000001,683.0400000000001," clip didn't make me think that they know it's a joke. No, because they did when they showed that"
683.0400000000001,689.76," octopoeic point thing, he would have went like, I thought this thing in prey. Yeah. Right. Yeah."
689.76,693.9200000000001, So ironic. Yeah.
694.64,700.8000000000001," Duke, what's funny is when we when before this came out and we were joking, like, what, you"
700.8000000000001,704.5600000000001," know, we're, we're all assuming like, okay, after all this time, whatever the internet's"
704.5600000000001,706.96," making a big deal about it, we're going to see this trail and there's going to be some"
707.9200000000001,712.24," we're hoping like everyone else would be cool. But then we were joking, like, okay, what,"
712.24,717.44," what's it actually, like, what would it be if it sucked? And it was like, yeah, he's just going to be,"
717.44,720.5600000000001," like, you know, they're going to show them like walking solely down a hall and then there's he's"
720.5600000000001,725.36, going to puss cigarette smoke and say something badass at the end. And like that's almost what I want.
725.36,730.4000000000001," We were like, Sean, call the exact. We got the cigarette going to cigars. He's going to puss smoke"
730.4000000000001,735.36," would it say, if you said that, pretty much what happened. Yeah. Do you hear some metal, right?"
735.36,739.76, And it will end on some bullshit tagline. At least like it's like walking over into
739.76,747.6," Donahos cube. Did it. It's smoking metal. At least, at least a consistent. Yeah, over 10 years."
748.48,754.8000000000001, We'll see. We will see. I do. I credit them though because they did manage to blow up the internet
754.8000000000001,761.04," over this thing. I was looking at a game tab, you know, the news aggregator site sponsor by Zif"
761.04,768.4," Davis Incorporated and at game tab, like every number one story was to do. And it like,"
769.1999999999999,773.8399999999999," what's a good story to them for getting that. When Brian Wilson smile came out, even if you"
773.8399999999999,778.3199999999999," never liked the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson, you still want to read. And like if Chinese democracy"
778.3199999999999,782.56," by guns and roses comes out, if you think guns and roses suck, you're still going to want to read about it."
782.56,787.52," Right? I've read every article about generous records and I don't like them. Yeah. I mean,"
787.52,792.16," it's a story. It's like what I'm saying. Oh, it's great. Any time someone falls out the face of the"
792.16,798.48," year at the past to justify, you know, a 10 year money sink. It's just, it's good news. It's a good story."
798.48,803.04, Right. The thing about this to transition into another news item from this week is that
804.16,808.8," I think a lot of us are expecting it to be a budget game. It's just makes, I don't know. I've heard"
808.8,812.24," that around the office. I know, shoe is kind of assuming is like, it looks like a budget game, right?"
812.24,816.16," I think it's more of a joke. I mean, like it would be a, I mean, for a considering the subject matter,"
816.24,820.8," it probably be like a best-shell of Walmart, but I mean, I don't know. But this is a thing."
820.8,825.76," Not a state's not a joke, right? Okay. Say it's 39.99. Say it's being better yet. It's 29.99."
825.76,830.4," Okay. And it gets, you know, it is has prone to placement in Walmart and other, you know,"
830.4,835.52," best buy and stuff like that. And then you compare it to say crisis in UT3, which we know"
836.7199999999999,843.68," as in US sales as of last week or something. We're 30,000 units for Unreal Tournament 3 and 86,000"
844.0,847.92," for crisis, right? And that's another part of the discussion which we can transition into."
847.92,853.92," Why so low for that? That was all your scourmet. Yeah. Yeah. Way to go, Sean."
853.92,858.9599999999999," And but you feel like maybe maybe hardware, system requirements and just the sort of the assumption"
858.9599999999999,863.3599999999999," that you don't have the right rig to play and then you look and you're like, hey, this is business based"
863.3599999999999,866.8," on, you know, on a palligetically on the Doom 3 engine. But guess what, you could play it."
866.8,870.56," Yeah. Whatever you got, you bought the computer at Walmart. You buy the game Walmart. Take"
870.56,873.76, out when you play both. It would be surprised. You get a bundle. You can forever.
873.76,879.04, Whatever the quality is sold more than crisis. Run Unreal Tournament 3. I totally believe it.
879.04,882.64," At this point, yeah. Oh, another than I know what they sold. I was a little shocked."
882.64,886.56," Yeah. Yeah. For novelty, say good sell more. I mean, if they have it for 20 bucks,"
886.56,890.0," it gets sell more than like, who do I think, like, a game like, who do I"
890.0,895.1199999999999, just road trip sold well? Because it's a technological barriers are obviously like one of the
895.1199999999999,898.9599999999999, secrets to wow success because that requires so it's a little hard. Right.
899.44,904.0," Actually, one thing I didn't want. I was wondering though was like, what is Duke's, you know,"
904.0,909.36," what does that name even mean to younger gamers who, I mean, it's been forever since it was a Duke"
909.36,913.6800000000001, game. Isn't there now a whole generation of teenage gamers who never even heard of Duke's?
913.6800000000001,917.76, The source material is not going to make sense and there's a huge gap of living in that time
917.76,921.6," that they're going to miss. So it's not just Schwarzenegger movies and such, but yeah,"
921.6,927.9200000000001," comic bookfad. You remember when you had in the 80s spawned anti-captin America, it was always a guy"
928.0,932.4799999999999," sort of dressed in the stars and stripes, but he was like, instead of the super soldier serum,"
932.4799999999999,937.36," it was like this, the US government version of like super crack or something to spawn."
937.36,941.8399999999999," Frank Miller created? No, Frank. You, Ryan knows exactly what I'm talking about. Especially"
941.8399999999999,946.7199999999999," anyone who read Marvel Comics, but like American flag also, okay, the characters in Marvel Comics"
946.7199999999999,952.48," where there were subsequent a tent, instead of the Starry I'd 1940s version of Captain America,"
952.5600000000001,959.44," you get these super cynical America representations, representatives of America projecting its power abroad,"
960.24,965.44," and you have basically just, yeah, these drug addicted psychopaths that were in the stars and stripes."
965.44,970.48, And it kind of the Duke Nukem thing is part of that too. And you're saying that Duke has an icon
970.48,974.5600000000001," is an activist. The character's name is Nukem. So for Marvel Comics, I'm thinking of Nukem."
974.5600000000001,979.12," Yeah. He was no, we think of it in inspiration for Duke Nukem. Right."
979.12,985.04," Yeah. You think like, what I mean is besides the iconography of Duke, I mean he himself does his"
985.04,989.68," name, actually, mean anything if you're 13. The name will, doesn't mean anything. I'm saying"
989.68,995.28, even more so even looking at him and hearing the lines is not going to mean anything. Yeah. Right.
995.28,999.44," Most of most of the modern kids are like, they know Rainier Wolf Castle, like the parody of"
999.44,1004.64," Marvel Comics. Right. They'll be trying to connect, they'll just be trying to connect with"
1004.72,1008.88, they've seen in this trailer to say like team America or something. Right. Yeah.
1008.88,1012.96," Yeah. They're parody. But it's like, that is like, I mean, like trying to go back and watch"
1012.96,1016.96," like it all like command. Oh, it won't Schwarzenegger movie today, which takes itself very seriously."
1016.96,1022.0, Right. That's kind of what Duke Nukem is to me. Right. But they couldn't get away with that now.
1022.0,1026.8," Right. I mean, they just know. This is the age of like snide, you know? I mean, everything is"
1026.8,1031.92," facetious and snide. And you need a barat, a barat. Yeah. You know?"
1032.88,1037.52," That's why I'm saying to play with it. I mean, just like have fun with right. How the like the equivalent"
1037.52,1042.24, of the Garth and his characters that can't that fuck up swearing. Maybe they will fit up a
1042.24,1048.3200000000002, cost of it. Yeah. Yeah. So what do we think about this crisis? You teething. We want to move on to that.
1048.3200000000002,1052.8000000000002, Yeah. How are we? Are we done with Duke? Yeah. Let's go right into that. That's why I brought him up
1052.8000000000002,1058.16," until the next trailer in 2020. 2020. I think it's pretty alarming. I mean, right?"
1058.16,1064.72," Well, a little bit. It's pretty far to look at it as good news. Yay. I certainly hope to see"
1064.72,1069.76," crisis sell a bowload. You know, I mean, just because I wanted other people to experience it as an"
1069.76,1074.4," FPS fan and you know, someone who talks with other people about FPS play. One thing I mentioned in the"
1074.4,1079.52, course of the discussion after I played it was that it's the kind of game where you really do need to
1079.52,1084.0800000000002," play to understand the range of experiences in a genre. You know, the thing the possibilities."
1085.04,1089.52," I wonder, I mean, we've talked about this before and I think it's like accepted wisdom now that"
1089.52,1094.96," I think I believe, but it definitely, I think, got tainted by the by the requirements thing."
1094.96,1097.9199999999998, And I'm sure I can actually back that up big time because actually I'm in the middle of
1097.9199999999998,1101.1999999999998, working on the ultimate game machine competition right now. Right. And we're using that as one of our
1101.1999999999998,1105.76, benchmark tests. And so what we're doing is every single game we have we're we're we're throwing a bunch of
1105.76,1111.52," games these like machines that have like three graphics cards like, you know, 8800 altres and S all"
1111.52,1116.24," I so it's like this crazy powerful $10,000 system they can do three now they can do three now."
1116.24,1122.4," The hell. This is how retarded it is. So basically, I have we we tried throwing every game at 2560 by 1600"
1123.04,1128.4," and the only game that would not run is crisis. Now there's like $10,000 fucking machine and I can't"
1128.4,1134.0," run crisis at that level. So there's an obvious concern, but I think that, um, well, it's two parts."
1134.0,1139.84," One, they are working on a performance patches. I've talked to their to EAPR people. There are"
1139.9199999999998,1143.52," actively working on a performance, but it's going to lower the bar a little, but still. Right."
1144.32,1148.3999999999999, That game is not meant to be run at these high resolutions on the current machines. Right.
1148.3999999999999,1153.28," But that's, I mean, part of the, at least part of their argument, whether it's clearly it's failing."
1153.28,1157.9199999999998, We don't know if it's the reason why. Right. But was that their future proofing it and that you could
1157.9199999999998,1162.56," play it at acceptable resolutions today on acceptable hardware. And so that was like, if you like"
1162.56,1168.72," my home rig, you know, but I do have an 8800 in there and I was I played it like medium settings."
1168.8,1172.8," Right. Yeah. It has to, but you have to say though that medium settings, the game still looks"
1172.8,1178.64," far superior to anything else available. And that's counting, of course, on real tournament."
1178.64,1183.28, That's counting. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It looks like significantly superior to anything else that you
1183.28,1188.08," could play. But the fact that people like you have to keep saying that means that, you know, that"
1188.08,1193.52," that barrier is in people's minds. I mean, look, I have an installed it at, um, my own machine at home,"
1193.52,1198.4," because I'm thinking my machine's not going to run it well. It may very well, but I bought into"
1198.8000000000002,1204.48, it as well as everybody has that I'm not ready for this game. You and Sean haven't played it. Yeah.
1204.48,1209.92," Right. So I feel like it's not going to work. It actually crashes every text. You know, you know,"
1209.92,1214.0800000000002," you might want to try actually I've ran it to the same problem. And and I agree with Sean. I mean,"
1214.0800000000002,1217.0400000000002, like actually you can run this at lower resolutions and lower settings and you're going to get a
1217.0400000000002,1221.2800000000002," great experience matter of fact. We have a sub $1,000 machine in the office. I've been testing it on"
1221.2800000000002,1226.0800000000002," it lower settings and then you could play it fine. But you're missing on all the cool, you know, all the"
1226.1599999999999,1230.24," high end effects, right. But try running actually, try running it in a window. It sounds"
1230.24,1234.24," got me sounds kind of crazy, but it actually moved a lot of the crashes issues that I saw home."
1235.04,1239.36," The whole future proofing thing. I mean, don't a lot of games do that to some extent."
1239.36,1243.12," Yeah. Well, let me like you can actually, you could backtrack that you started as though. Yeah. I'm"
1243.12,1247.6799999999998," that's all I agree with either. I mean, maybe better to do it in patches. You know, the way the"
1247.6799999999998,1251.9199999999998, way people work in games work is like if something something's not top of mind pretty close to
1251.92,1256.5600000000002," when it comes out and then, you know, it's on the next big thing. So yeah, we're not going to be"
1256.5600000000002,1260.16," people in two years. I'm going to go all time for crisis because that would be like, and that was"
1260.16,1267.1200000000001," crisis. Oh, yeah. I remember crisis. Yeah. It needed to be awesome for everybody right now and it needed to"
1267.1200000000001,1273.68," look awesome and play awesome right now. This, this was its moment. It depends on, I haven't looked at"
1273.68,1280.0," the results from the latest like steam survey for hardware survey, but I mean, it kind of depends on"
1280.0,1284.24," what most people have right now. Well, those are always, because I said, it does run really well"
1284.24,1289.12," at those settings on 80 100, but that's the top of the line card right now. But I'm, I was talking"
1289.12,1292.96," about, you know, not the whatever one it is, the lower budget one is the one that I'm. The GTs."
1292.96,1296.72," Yeah. Actually, you know what you could, seriously, like for what people could spend right now"
1296.72,1301.6," on the the GTX is that you got, people can get 280 and 100 GT's and run them in SLI and they"
1301.6,1307.2," can get really good performance on that. Whoop by and two video cards. It sounds crazy. I know,"
1307.2,1312.56," but even the one GT is still good. One GT is so awesome. One GT is pretty good, but I'm just saying,"
1312.56,1316.96, it's actually more economical now to get two cheaper cards and have run an SLI that is to buy one
1316.96,1321.76," on high-end card. Most people aren't going to understand that though. Yeah, that's true, but it really"
1321.76,1325.8400000000001," isn't that tough. It's actually, it's a simple plugin in the card and you say SLI and you've lost like"
1325.8400000000001,1329.3600000000001," half the game. Yeah, I actually might be in. I'm making a stick to some of people who do the"
1329.3600000000001,1334.96," tech sections. So do we think, I don't what? I don't think that the system, you know,"
1335.04,1340.08," entry requirements are the sole. No, of course. It's not the only, absolutely not. Passee is always"
1340.08,1344.88, going to come up and we do know that the version that the game was pirated before it's launched. We were
1344.88,1352.08," at lunch today with folks from EA actually, Ryan Scott and I and that came up. We brought up the"
1352.08,1360.48," issue of crisis sales and he, the guy we were talking to who's producer, not on that series said that"
1360.56,1367.84," I think it was just a morning did he say he was on a pirate, you know, a site, a website and"
1368.56,1373.44, there was some astronomical number of copies of crisis being downloaded that very moment.
1373.44,1377.1200000000001," It was like 14,000 or something like 14,000. Yeah, like 14,000. And when you can share the game"
1377.1200000000001,1381.04," sold like well, like 86,000, that's going to be off when you say it when you see that, that's going to piss"
1381.04,1385.68," people off. I mean, that's. World markets are also important to factor in when you look at PC"
1385.68,1389.6, get yourself. We know that right now. We know the German markets huge. We know that there are
1389.6799999999998,1394.6399999999999," significant game populations in Sweden, Norway and New Zealand Australia, you know, all throughout"
1394.6399999999999,1399.6799999999998," Eastern Europe. So that's not enough to say that hey, well, they ended up selling two more"
1399.6799999999998,1404.0, million in those markets. I don't think that. I think it's something else to keep in mind.
1404.6399999999999,1408.7199999999998," But yeah, I wonder when you look at this, that you know, more and more developers are just like"
1408.7199999999998,1412.56," about PC. I'm doing console only from now on. So basically, yeah, what you just said like"
1413.52,1417.9199999999998," right now, 14,000 people were downloading crisis that is just ridiculous compared to how much"
1418.0,1422.0800000000002, it actually so why would you why would you do that to yourself? I totally forget it up for
1422.0800000000002,1429.04," us gamers. It's it's horrible for us because yeah, like crisis is the one, you know, out for single"
1429.04,1435.2," player, the one PC exclusive shooter this year outside of you know, stocker was also great."
1436.0,1440.4," I don't know how well that sold. But and we want, you know, and to push the tech envelope"
1440.4,1444.24," and stuff and if the lesson now is like, you know, basically they put their hand on the stove"
1444.24,1448.16," and they got burned. It's like, don't reach for the stars and your graphics anymore."
1448.72,1452.32," Playing for like low end machines. I mean, what are the, you know, what are the repercussions for this?"
1452.32,1456.8," I mean, dude, do you just, you know, do you a play at safe on every count? Do you just do multiple"
1456.8,1460.8," platforms? That said, and it was really upsetting to see Shane Betonhausen for a, EGM,"
1460.8,1466.32," glowed about it. He hit me up on aim and it was like, this is where I first heard about these sales"
1466.32,1470.8," figures. You know, and it was followed with like, ha ha, PC gaming is dead, exclamation mark. So"
1471.76,1477.2, says the guy who's a champion of the of the most failed console system of this generation.
1478.8,1483.28," Sorry, credibility hit that. I don't know if you're going to play. It's like, that was upsetting to me."
1483.28,1487.44," Of course, like, I will do you think that like, what if you work for a PlayStation magazine or something?"
1487.44,1492.0," And I'm saying, like, hey, guess what? Dude, your platform is a, this fucking failed PC shit."
1492.0,1496.1599999999999," I mean, like your job. You're going to have it for a long."
1497.1200000000001,1502.4," Thank you. So that was stupid, but it was also like, I don't understand why you'd want anything to fail."
1502.4,1508.8000000000002," Right. And then, but even more, he has this thing where he was like, no, but here's what, what it means is that PC is no longer"
1508.8000000000002,1513.2, sort of the four runner platform for first person shoot right. He said that. I want up your own.
1513.2,1519.52," And this is a bizarre sort of claim to me. For one, it's absolutely an entirely wrapped up in sales."
1519.52,1525.6000000000001," Like the only, it's, it's putting your blinders on and seeing the gaming world only through an economic lens, right?"
1527.1200000000001,1534.8000000000002," And to us, it's like, well, that, no, we, this year, we still got stocker, we still got, you know, crisis."
1534.8000000000002,1541.28," And we're still, even though they're multi-platform team fortress two and, you know, we're COD four and stuff too."
1541.28,1546.96," And it's like, it's not just this box. To me, it's not just, you pick, I don't understand."
1546.96,1550.3200000000002," Like, what is it, are you just trying to say, will this platform sold more copies of it?"
1550.3200000000002,1554.96," I don't really care about that sort of thing. And when we should have shane on the podcast here,"
1554.96,1560.56," we should inhabit at with them. As a PC, you know, gamers, so an hyperverse play FPS on PC."
1560.56,1565.3600000000001," It's not about that. It's about, well, it's, it's viable and it's valid to me and it's the forefront to me."
1565.3600000000001,1572.4," Because for the very reasons that console gamers don't like it, you know, it's like, I like to play in front of a monitor at a desk."
1572.4,1576.88," I like to use, you know, the networking options that I have on PC, you know, been trillow."
1576.88,1581.1200000000001, And then I'm able to talk to a group of people that way. And then also to the people in the game through
1581.12,1586.6399999999999," VIPs, so we're able to sort of put that like dramatic irony wall there in between us and talk about them and"
1586.6399999999999,1592.9599999999998," and talk to them. And it's just like the way I like the interface, the mods and all the other things."
1592.9599999999998,1597.9199999999998," There's slowly changing and leveling out, but it's like, I enjoy playing it that way. It's valid to me."
1597.9199999999998,1603.6799999999998," And it's like, I'm not, I don't understand the whole mentality of like, this is the best platform ever."
1603.6799999999998,1606.56," Here's a war PC is the best, because you could see this guy scar."
1607.04,1609.44, You're not that. I don't know.
1610.48,1612.24," I doubt a very, very, very, really in person."
1613.28,1620.1599999999999," Yeah. Right. I mean, my other, my other, what I'm concerned about with the crisis,"
1620.1599999999999,1625.44," or not concerned with it, what I think what I suspect might be part of the problem is that there was"
1625.44,1633.2," within the game industry, like an insular, maybe misperception of its recognition factor."
1633.28,1636.8," Like, I don't know if anybody outside of a very hardcore group of people, even knew what the"
1636.8,1642.56, fuck it was. I don't feel like EA necessarily did the greatest job advertising this thing.
1642.56,1646.96," We compared to like, what, you know, Halo coverage and, right, or rock band, you know,"
1646.96,1651.76," some of EA's own games, where was the big push for crisis? I never saw it."
1651.76,1655.68," They did, they had events and stuff for it. I don't see, but that's, well, they have it."
1655.68,1658.56," But I mean, for a more mainstream audience, right. Exactly."
1658.56,1662.32," Right. They did a great job of preaching to the choir, but that's what I'm saying. Right."
1662.8,1670.32," If this was the big, great, awesome PC game for the PC this year, there could, there should have been"
1670.32,1677.36, much more aggressive push. Right. Yeah. No mainstream stories. Right. Was overlooked from the beginning.
1677.36,1680.8799999999999," Like, even when we were saying, like, it weren't E3, it was like, you know, the fact that it"
1680.8799999999999,1684.96," exactly didn't even get like the graphics darling word, which made no sense, because it was clearly"
1684.96,1689.36," now that all the games from the E3 are out. I mean, like, buy it. But when you think about that,"
1689.6799999999998,1694.08," right, that E3 when Microsoft, we talk about the Microsoft press conference, they had their"
1694.08,1698.1599999999999," things show it. They had their big freaking thing in that outdoor auditorium and there were like,"
1698.1599999999999,1706.1599999999999," games for windows. And then the most awesome platform ever, scouting better."
1707.4399999999998,1711.4399999999998, And then the first signature show is like fucking Viva Pignon. The B movie. Yeah.
1711.4399999999998,1716.7199999999998," Which they are so close for the Xbox. And it's like show crisis, man. So crisis. You got an"
1716.72,1722.32," 8,000 foot toss cream. And they did it. And it was like, okay. Well, the second ever in a montage."
1722.32,1725.6000000000001," Yeah, you fail. And it should have had a walk through. They should have had"
1725.6000000000001,1730.8, crytick on the stage. They should have everything that that's great about the game. They should have
1730.8,1733.52, shown a scenario. Did what they did with Call Duty 4 right exactly. Because the
1733.52,1738.48," call duty 4 was the one everybody walked with game. Oh. And when they also left, they stole all"
1738.48,1744.8, those ass pads. Because this was the year and you to explain to the listener out there.
1745.76,1751.12, It was in a high school auditorium. And it was basically just brick to sit on. So Microsoft
1751.12,1754.72, provided these these butt cushions. And they have right for soft branding on. There's like
1754.72,1758.8," cheap, fun butt cushions. And when it ended and all these sloppy ss were sitting there"
1758.8,1763.36," sharding on them for the whole evening. Right. And then when the thing ends, people who start,"
1763.36,1767.6," you see guys leaving with like four of them, I'm sorry. Like what are you going to do with that?"
1767.6,1771.9199999999998," Dude, what are they? Take back your baby. The people that put them on the my mom."
1771.92,1781.92," I started like fucking dude. Dude, Nucum. That was crazy. Yeah, the swiping. The mass swiping of"
1781.92,1785.92," swiping of wipes. This one due to two armloids, I remember just seeing the hat. Yeah."
1785.92,1789.92, Yeah. You mean he's grinning from ear to ear. Like I want to make a fortune that like
1789.92,1795.92," nice school. Do that next year. Like have just just dot E3, Hall of Shame. You know, just dot"
1796.48,1805.1200000000001, photodocometry of human filth. I'm I'm. So then so that was crisis. But way worse is
1805.1200000000001,1812.5600000000002, 33. And that's very scalable. So that's why I'm saying like maybe not just the actual requirements.
1812.5600000000002,1817.8400000000001," It's true. I can't argue with that though. I wouldn't buy, I don't like UT3 enough to buy"
1817.8400000000001,1824.24," or write. Okay. So what happened, Nucum? Here we have a unlike crisis, which was arguably recognizable,"
1824.32,1830.88, UT totally recognizable franchise. Right. And it's a pleasure. You got like the whole like from
1830.88,1834.16, the guys who just did games of war. Right. So you just keep getting the war. It's the very
1834.16,1839.92," next game from the guys who did games of war. And this thing was a or late, I said, I want to say it"
1839.92,1846.32," was a turd, but it late, a turd in terms of the sales this week. So how do you explain that?"
1846.88,1850.88," I don't think we can. I think as soon as well, maybe you guys can. Why can't everyone?"
1850.88,1854.0," I was like, I hypothesized something. I'm able to shoot it down immediately."
1854.88,1857.92," Did it come out for the console, too? It came out for the PS3."
1857.92,1861.68, It's a very hard game. It's very hard game. It's interesting. Right. It's three doesn't really help.
1861.68,1863.92, Shooters are good now because there's one on the PS3.
1866.8000000000002,1870.0800000000002, I'd like to see the sales figures for the PS3 version versus the PC version.
1870.0800000000002,1874.64, I'm sure the PS3 version will do better because they don't only have many options for that kind of stuff.
1875.2800000000002,1878.16, Yeah. But I'm kind of...
1878.24,1882.8000000000002, That there's an excellent link below because anyone who is ever into UT on PC would continue to
1882.8000000000002,1886.88," want to play it on PC. That's how it goes. And I say this is someone, like, I'm in the know because"
1886.88,1891.92," I love first first shooters on PC. And then given the option, I will always play them on the platform"
1891.92,1895.92, with the exception of games like Halo that are made for. They're very clearly made from the
1895.92,1900.8000000000002," beginning for the other platform. So it's not like someone who says, you know, I played tournaments"
1900.8000000000002,1905.52," in 2K4. It was a huge fan of, you know, the previous ones. But this year, I just decided I really"
1905.52,1910.72, wanted to play it on PS3. That person doesn't exist. Right. Right. And less or maybe they do in
1910.72,1916.0," their like, hey, I just gave up on it wouldn't be, it would be more I gave up on upgrading my computer."
1916.0,1921.04, Right. I gave them that and I got a P3 for Christmas shirts. I could just be a multi player
1921.04,1925.6, FPS glut right now. Like imagine this is come out a year ago when a lot of the stuff that
1925.6,1930.48, actually came out now was maybe going to come out. Like because we got we got that was no problem to
1930.96,1934.24, forward though. It's no problem for Team Fortress 2. Maybe it is only a certain number of
1934.24,1937.6, I'm right. I was talking to the top. Team Fortress 2 came out early enough in that cycle. So that
1937.6,1942.32," guy was like, and it was so awesome. It wouldn't matter. Team Fortress 2 would be, yeah."
1942.32,1948.16, But what if you came out first of all of these? Maybe it wouldn't. I don't know. Look at
1948.16,1950.72, quite a word. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That's not well. That hasn't done very well.
1950.72,1954.56, I came up to get for all of them. I don't think the order matters. This is what I mean by
1954.56,1959.92, shooting down my own hypothesis. One would get contemporary and real life settings seem to do well.
1959.92,1963.76," As you take the evidence from Call of Duty 4 right. But then you're like, well, bio-shark was"
1963.76,1969.3600000000001, sold phenomenally well. So did half life episode 2. Those aren't really shoot that down. Another
1969.3600000000001,1975.76, thing though is that there's this trend where every time when you take a genre that's been
1975.76,1979.68, around for a while and after it's around for so many generations they're continually
1980.48,1986.0, iterating on them based on feedback from hardcore players and pleasing the hardcore. And every time
1986.08,1990.56, of spoken with epic it's always been very much about pleasing that audience. And
1991.12,1995.28," Valve did the opposite thing with Team Fortress 2 right. Instead of I was one of the skeptics,"
1995.28,1998.56," you know, because I was that hardcore audience there. Instead of saying, well, let's make Sean"
1998.56,2004.88, happy and put the Kongs back in and do all this other stuff. Let's actually simplify this game.
2004.88,2009.04," Whereas the trend with like the multiplayer and crisis and the multiplayer in UT3,"
2009.92,2015.68," simple CTF and death match now, standing is at this point like one of my complaints was"
2015.68,2023.28, that it's convoluted right? Maybe it's getting to that part in the cycle of the genre
2024.0,2027.84," where to get more and to get new players, the simplicity actually helps."
2027.84,2033.44, Yeah. And also maybe those franchises themselves have like worn out there welcome. Maybe
2033.44,2039.6000000000001," there's just like a lifespan to how long. You know, maybe unreal, unreal tournament 3 is like"
2039.6000000000001,2044.96," smokey in the band at 6. Like how many smoking the band at movies do you see before, you know,"
2044.96,2049.6, first it's burnt Reynolds a smokey and then he and then after a while he doesn't want to be in it anymore.
2049.6,2054.8," So Jackie Gleason's a star. Then after Jackie Gleason dies, they gotta have like Andrew Dice Clay is"
2054.8,2058.8, like Jackie Gleason's cousin. And then it's smokey in the band at whatever.
2058.88,2067.6000000000004, Yeah. So maybe maybe maybe at a certain point those of us who used to be into unreal are
2067.6000000000004,2073.92," sort of like yeah, okay, already. Um, well, I just just two quick thoughts one. I agree with both"
2073.92,2078.8," you guys. First of all, what I do think like UT actually kind of scaled down it's complexity"
2078.8,2083.76," as opposed to the Quake Wars, which actually is a lot more complex. Right. But I do agree with"
2083.76,2088.4," you guys and that I think it's one of those like eras not gone by but definitely like evolving. I mean,"
2088.88,2094.0," UT still remains like if you sit down and play it, it really is a twitch fest. Right. And you look at"
2094.0,2098.88," most other I think with you know, TF2 being the exception. I think that most games are slowing down the"
2098.88,2104.4, pace of some. So but that but is that preventing people from buying it though? Like does that explain why?
2104.4,2108.7200000000003, I don't know. I have like like you guys. I don't know anything like this. Because most the
2108.7200000000003,2113.36, sales that really make these games successful aren't coming from people who are articulating any of
2113.36,2117.44, these things. Not that they're dumb. It's just they don't think about them. They don't care. They just go
2117.76,2123.76, the store and like this looks like a fun game. Right. Whatever. It's in that thought process.
2123.76,2126.7200000000003," You know, it might be they've heard a few things from friends but then they quickly scan the"
2126.7200000000003,2131.76," aisle and say, you know what? That's worth my 50 bucks. Like it's hard to say what what is,"
2131.76,2134.7200000000003," you know, in there but that could be something they could think about like yeah, I remember"
2134.7200000000003,2140.7200000000003, you used to play that game but I'm a little older now and I just be more big gone. I don't know.
2140.72,2150.56," It's hard. $20. Yes. Well, I think soldier fortune selling fairly well if it. Oh, please"
2150.56,2167.7599999999998," got is it? Well, I was playing that so I could say something about it."
2168.32,2172.5600000000004, The keep it keep the abbreviated since I did talk about it on a note podcast but
2172.5600000000004,2176.4," I basically history channel. Well, that's for people come out. Jeff."
2177.76,2182.0800000000004, This is pretty admit. That's for people who listen to multiple shows and don't want to
2182.0800000000004,2186.5600000000004," you say that last week. Oh, fine. You show us in the multiple shows. It's like a history channel"
2186.5600000000004,2190.96, world-roar to a game. The thing is when you when you put a history channel stamp on something. Uh-huh.
2190.96,2197.1200000000003," It's not I mean, I like a library of fucking Congress but it still it says something. Right. It says that"
2197.2,2202.48, this isn't just a game where you go and just blow people. It wants you you should at least be aware that
2202.48,2207.2799999999997, this was based it says. It says a game that a basic cable TV channel has endorsed.
2209.2799999999997,2219.2799999999997," I know I fuck up my gosh. Yeah. Yep. You could say that about that. Hey, I'm history"
2219.2799999999997,2222.96, channel's demographic. I like watching it as long as it's not just the same. When they have
2222.96,2227.2," interesting stuff, I'm a fan of the dog fights and then shoot out series that they have where they"
2227.2,2231.92," recreate them. I'm kind of like anything but World War II. To get to the point, the problem is of all"
2231.92,2237.44, the world or two and you know historic we based shooters out there. This is probably the least concerned
2238.2400000000002,2243.84, with accuracy of all of them. It's just they just put the name on there. Right.
2243.84,2249.84, It's a little random motorcycle with a laser gun. But a few of the fun parts cybernetic Hitler.
2250.8,2255.6800000000003, But there's one I'm convinced that there's one character model in the entire game. And so that
2255.6800000000003,2262.0, means that all of your allies are the same guy. Right. And they can make a bus test. I think it's
2262.0,2265.92," going to model. No, they don't bother with it. They don't bother with it. They don't bother with the"
2265.92,2271.84, clothes or anything. So it's the same guy. And they have the same animation. And so sometimes you have
2271.84,2278.08, to stick with them as the other thing. And this is a game that when you move like I don't know 30 yards
2278.16,2283.6, away from the guy who is yelling at you follow me follow me follow me follow me the whole time
2283.6,2288.0, over and over again with one voice loop he doesn't even change in flexion. Then it will just stop
2288.0,2292.56, just game over right. So oh my god. That means you have to stay with these like fucking
2292.56,2297.6, knuckleheads that are all from the same cloning cylinder. And not only that look back at him now and then
2297.6,2301.92, and they have one idol animation and it looks like a crackhead like no Dave Chappelle's character
2302.4,2308.88, always that like blow all over his face. He's scratching his neck. So they have they look like that.
2308.88,2313.6800000000003, I think it's supposed to be them like settling their their kid their gear. But it looks like their
2313.6800000000003,2318.48, crackhead doing the crackhead scratch and I look and they were all cute up doing it exactly the same
2318.48,2324.0, time like synchronized crackheads scratching. And then you look into his face and as he's doing
2324.0,2335.2, he's like follow me. That game is pretty bad. You know that you're talking about it to convince
2335.2,2341.36, people because there's no working for it. I probably want this. Now in that there's a flat gun
2341.36,2347.12, say because they want to spice it up. She down some planes. The planes come through on a fixed circuit
2347.12,2351.92, and it's basically just looping the way that they fly through. And so you get on the flag and shoot
2352.56,2357.12, and it sounds you know I've said it sounds like someone throwing a penny on a baking pan but like
2357.12,2362.56, very sporadically like only you don't once every 15 seconds. Meanwhile you have a rapid fire gun hitting
2362.56,2366.88, it and they come through you can't tell you're doing anything to it you know you can't tell you don't
2366.88,2370.8, they don't blow up or anything and you see it going at circuit and you're like oh I think it's on fire
2370.8,2375.44, a little bit and it keeps coming through and then that ends and it's like they have this big
2375.44,2379.92, feed or say you're in an airfield and then we're called duty would say okay this is going to be
2380.0,2384.4, a defense thing figure out what you're going to do because he's army is going to counter attack
2384.4,2389.44, you right now. So they throw in like five like Japanese soldiers come down the middle of the runway
2390.2400000000002,2394.56, and they just they just come down and then you kill them and then another five common another five
2394.56,2397.36, and it just keeps doing that and then you're like this is dumb I'm not going to wait for them I'm
2397.36,2401.12, going to go down the end of the runway so you go down the end of the runway so you don't have to wait
2401.12,2405.36, so long for them to run exposed down the runway to get you very historically accurate again
2405.84,2410.48, they run past you to the same spot that they were going to go no matter what so you just like
2410.48,2416.6400000000003, piece out see you guys she's doing the back and then you do that's what that must be the way
2416.6400000000003,2419.76, it happened because it's got the history channel stamp on it that's the history channel
2419.76,2424.0, it's one of those games though we're going to look the whole time I'm playing it every single thing
2424.0,2429.04, it is a lesson like oh god of all it makes you appreciate the stuff that goes right in
2429.04,2433.76, in games that do get it right like oh I shouldn't take the stuff for granted because
2434.7200000000003,2441.5200000000004, so maybe you should play this as kind of just reset your bar right right oh oh oh
2441.5200000000004,2446.2400000000002, then we could adjust our rating scale accordingly every game can be based on whether it's
2446.2400000000002,2451.6000000000004, better than that history channel it's that on the history channel scale this gets a 10
2455.28,2460.48, well it gets anything as good as that Sean Lloyd's been playing something he loved
2460.48,2471.76, actually finished it huh oh oh oh oh no no no no no no no no no I'm sorry let's take a break we'll get back
2471.76,2477.36, to the okay we'll take a break and we'll hear what what so excited just tell me a week ago

2509.76,2516.1600000000003, details like a pebble that has been rounded over the centuries by the gentle splashing of the
2516.1600000000003,2524.6400000000003, ocean waves hey now three has become the perfect hardcore first person combat simulator
2526.1600000000003,2532.7200000000003, by the end of painstaking labor on the part of its developer bungee it has been refined over three
2532.7999999999997,2538.7999999999997, instalments to the point where it delivers only peer under-doubt-to-rated gaming bliss
2540.56,2547.6, every combat is even cited in complex and can be waged in multiple ways using an awesome
2547.6,2555.12, of long and short range weapons plus grenades and hand-to-hand moves every little one is perfectly
2555.2,2562.4, past and balanced and grazed with soaring architectural compositions plus it's graphically gorgeous
2563.52,2572.24, the epic storyline and the stirring score don't hurt either in one of the greatest guests video gaming
2572.24,2580.96, has ever seen hey low three is the very best of the bunch was that a knight who said me right there
2581.12,2590.48, yeah that's uh i want to read them all that was uh that was number one in times top ten video
2590.48,2596.64, games of 2007 roundup and this was something else it's a holdover from long we didn't podcast
2596.64,2601.68, because this came out a week or so ago this is written by Lev Grossman what one of my favorite
2603.44,2608.8, my favorite writers of all time everything this guy writes makes me want a fucking kill
2610.96,2616.64, Wagner game though yeah this is just i don't i don't know i shouldn't i shouldn't disempercely
2616.64,2622.08, maybe we'll meet someday and shake hands you know live grossman we probably went to the same
2622.08,2632.08, tempo growing up but dude and you could look at a singing with the Harvard and Yale he's got
2632.08,2636.56, you know there's things on his on his bio that are like you know he's he's one district at a
2637.44,2642.4, probably thinks he's slumming by writing about video games but dude please stop writing about video games
2643.68,2649.12, because he he made a top ten lesser of uh his best video games of the year this is time magazine
2649.12,2655.6, we spent week after week dising you know lame websites and magazines on our own industry our own
2655.6,2661.36, magazine but you expect a little better from time to your really these little one maybe you don't
2661.76,2669.04, i don't anymore that was hailed so his list of games actually is okay the top ten games he picked
2669.04,2675.44, it's like this is like the list of like generally agreed upon right i mean it's time so you're not
2675.44,2681.1200000000003, gonna you know they're not gonna go on that much of a limb is combat the right well i was number one
2681.1200000000003,2687.2000000000003, probably question i like that he he used his you know small word count to describe that the game has
2687.2,2691.52, long and short range weapons you can do hand-to-hand combat just like let me just like well right
2691.52,2696.3999999999996, but these right up to ridiculous the one i read to you i mean first of all does he he calls it a combat
2696.3999999999996,2701.12, simulator because you know he works for time and he went to Harvard and Yale so he can't just call it a
2701.12,2707.7599999999998, fucking shooter right combat simulator that's really that's what halo is that's the thing here is like i
2707.7599999999998,2712.48, understand i think actually i think the language is fine i'm a problem with i've no problem with the language
2712.48,2717.92, and that he had a very small amount of space very limited word count to say a gladi he
2717.92,2722.72, compared it to a pebble in the ocean that part is bullshit but the content is that it's just
2722.72,2728.2400000000002, vapid right yes and and so for example you have for mass effect it says choose a class love
2728.2400000000002,2732.8, love urn weapons and armor assemble your party talk to startlingly realistic aliens
2732.8,2737.44, mass effect has all the good stuff that games used to be about before the internet came along right
2737.44,2743.28, that's one of my favorite lines of another word uh since the internet there's never been a
2743.28,2748.56, game with that let you choose class yeah some will your party uh will the work of mine is
2748.56,2753.04, the startlingly realistic aliens part you know yeah things like that startling realistic aliens
2753.04,2760.2400000000002, and parts that one from architecture of stuff i mean i guess love knows what
2760.2400000000002,2764.64, day onions look like he's one of the startlingly realistic coming to the church
2764.96,2769.3599999999997, yeah i was what it was like out there and out of space love i think you got something going on
2769.3599999999997,2775.04, with this guy though they this leading you to want to pick on and start beef with them i do i call
2775.04,2780.7999999999997, him as a special vendetta i i do because he he's using many words to say absolutely nothing
2780.7999999999997,2785.2, yes which is what you just said i mean that that one line i want to i want to repeat that one
2785.2,2789.7599999999998, you said because that's my favorite one of this whole thing i i have to rant one more second about this
2790.2400000000002,2797.76, um yeah uh mass effect has all that good stuff the games used to be about before the internet came
2797.76,2805.44, along what the fuck are you talking about really what does that mean before the internet came
2805.44,2811.92, on the internet did not change how games are how they're played there's more games added other things
2811.92,2816.88, yes because of the internet now but single player RPGs existed before the internet yes right
2816.88,2821.44, and they still exist now so shut the fuck up you don't know what you're talking about even
2821.44,2827.04, don't write articles like that for time magazine if you're embarrassing everyone especially you
2828.2400000000002,2834.88, oh god i think sorry oh still long day and he's making it worse you know i can't wait to see
2834.88,2841.92, the day that you and he are on a panel together you and him and me in the Hogwarts guy from that
2841.92,2849.6800000000003, blog what's it yeah i can't remember his name a patchy Hogwarts oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
2850.7200000000003,2854.96, we'll have some white so low man i got i got a story about him i don't like a shirt on the air
2854.96,2858.0, but no we'll be alright we don't get everybody yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
2858.0,2862.4, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but we were talking about i was reading about mass effect so that's
2862.4,2865.84, good second and that's a good second right Sean is it in fact every good thing
2865.84,2868.64, that games used to be about before the internet came along yeah yeah yeah
2868.64,2877.04, back canceled my my DSL after playing it no i don't know i was gonna like last week
2877.04,2881.04, I was already to rant about it but now it's like kind of the games already at the point where
2881.52,2885.12, people like had the initial oh my god and it's already had the backlash so i don't want
2885.12,2889.2799999999997, to have a backlash yeah i think it has could you countered the backlash you could be the
2889.2799999999997,2894.7999999999997, backlash to the backlash there's a couple of points i want to to to make that i still think
2894.8,2899.04, are important um are there spoilers here no i'm gonna i'm gonna dodge spoilers here like i
2899.04,2903.28, last week i would have just bash specific scenes and stuff i mean i ultimately like the game i
2903.28,2907.76, had a really really tough time getting into it so you're broadly responding to all the claims
2907.76,2912.2400000000002, that this was the finest story ever told in the middle right yeah it's no that's all nonsense
2912.2400000000002,2917.6800000000003, meaning it's good it's a pretty good game yeah it's just keep has it respectfully flawed and some
2917.7599999999998,2925.44, really awesome stuff to it but to bring it back to what i think biores going the wrong way here
2925.44,2931.2799999999997, like a since coat or and then i've been with jd empire and i would this it's just seems to be
2931.2799999999997,2934.96, going in the wrong direction the main thing i don't want them to ever do ever ever again
2935.6,2941.7599999999998, is have their good and evil meter uh you mean like the visible meter that like yeah like
2941.7599999999998,2945.8399999999997, in coat or thing you know you're that much more evil there i mean i'm a lot of people yeah more
2945.92,2951.52, biores all about it seems like one of their trademark's not is like the people who make morality
2951.52,2958.1600000000003, games and they've taken it and almost just turned it into too much of a science so there's just
2958.1600000000003,2962.6400000000003, no like the boulders get you play boulders get one of those yeah there are moral choices in those
2962.6400000000003,2967.52, games there's always been moral choices in games with a give you dialogue trees they were a lot
2967.52,2971.92, more subtle they weren't like you know you would you do something evil and you wouldn't like get
2972.56,2976.96, devil horns of your head and you wouldn't start going red but that's kind of what they're doing now
2976.96,2983.12, kind of a bio shock right yeah yeah i guess so yeah so it's it's just so binary like right so
2983.12,2987.12, every decision either darkens or lightens right you can either character model like your
2987.12,2991.6, your options are and they've been like this for like even jd empire so if someone has to paper a
2991.6,2995.44, plastic and you were just getting devil horns by answering a plastic yeah and just sometimes you don't
2995.44,2998.96, even know but then you find out though that it takes more to even though the plastics were
2999.04,3003.2, recyclable that it takes more energy to process to make the plastic back with those things exactly
3003.2,3006.96, that's another problem i have with the game is that when you make your choices sometimes you're like
3006.96,3010.32, well well the reason i made that choice is totally different than what you just thought and you're
3010.32,3013.76, getting devil horns when you really thought you're going to get an angel halo yeah so it's just so binary
3013.76,3018.96, they never give you because they're like every one of your like choices in the game gives you these
3018.96,3025.12, points and it's either a good point or your evil point there's no incentive whatsoever because
3025.2799999999997,3031.04, they've made it a stat that has the tangible gameplay effect there's no reason whatsoever to kind of
3031.04,3036.24, just play it by ear like if you're not pure good if you're not like pure evil right i call it
3036.24,3040.72, paragon and renegade or whatever it's still like you know save the baby or eat the baby
3041.6,3048.48, the i say the baby you just know i i was playing the game in the very kind of middle of the roadway
3048.96,3051.68, yeah and ultimately i just like ended up
3052.8,3058.72, dumping myself this way i'm a suit options we're not a perfect game because of the option yeah and it just
3059.52,3064.56, what do you say i don't get that what they need it was a granular it's positive and just say that's the
3064.56,3067.2, question the week did so i'm so and figure out what that's about
3068.32,3071.68, Kevin guard okay all right what is the winner get nothing
3071.68,3076.0, copy a mask you get to get it get podcast it comes out on the Tuesday how about a copy of
3076.64,3080.4, pause the back of the car actually we can come on don't get the flag dot was branded keyboard
3080.96,3084.48, on okay move on so that's the that's the main thing i want to i want them
3085.28,3091.76, by wear if you're listening bring it back to like just ditch that system entirely the other problem
3091.76,3097.6, of the fact that you know the conversation system has that wheel yeah all of the good choices are
3097.6,3101.92, at the top of the wheel and all of the bad ones are at the bottom of the wheel right and if it's
3101.92,3106.2400000000002, really good it's blue and if it's really bad it's red so it almost becomes like a good and
3106.2400000000002,3110.8, evil minigame like and because of the way they write the dialogue you know you know how it works it's
3110.8,3114.48, like you pick a choice and it says uh-huh but then he says something really long-winded and right
3114.48,3120.0, uh-huh right sometimes you just like the only reason i know which one is good or bad
3120.0,3126.4, is because of the color or because of red right and that's just like it i don't like it how many
3126.48,3130.7200000000003, the wrong way and like it the you know the presentation after you do engage in these conversations
3130.7200000000003,3135.92, is pretty damn awesome and you know aliens are starting to leave realistic the humans are not
3136.48,3141.12, just a different problem right the women in that game all looked like just like play to go
3141.12,3147.52, limbs that's the hardest though yeah how about how about the combat uh uh i got here's a war
3147.52,3151.6, to agree i hated it at first hated it like it almost made me stop the game hated it
3152.32,3155.92, and then i got into it later like after i had all of my powers and everything it's just
3156.48,3162.48, it yeah like you said it wants like a half-ask years of war and a half-ask rpg i wouldn't have
3162.48,3167.52, had a problem with it if they hadn't scaled back the rpg kind of yeah elements to it
3168.2400000000002,3173.76, if they just like physically remove that good evil meter would i don't know what that would have
3173.76,3177.92, done yeah actually i have one question for you i was just thinking like in previous games that
3177.92,3181.92, by or did there it there was always a key point in the game where it just kind of like doesn't
3181.92,3185.76, matter what your choice to work beforehand you could be all of a sudden really good or all of a sudden
3185.84,3192.8, really bad does it have that here and kind of screw up that whole there's no no actually they do
3192.8,3197.0400000000004, well okay maybe i shouldn't have asked that because it could be like leave it to spoil the whole
3197.0400000000004,3200.96, and okay you know what i thought i was with that we could have a bio shark mime bio shark
3200.96,3206.48, mass effect spoiler things some other day but i don't know it's still worth playing yeah that was
3206.48,3211.1200000000003, that is what i mean good for the part of it at pc the driving crap is just absolute nonsense
3211.1200000000003,3215.0400000000004, like when you land on a planet just it's horrible it's absolutely terrible like they wanted to do
3215.12,3220.16, like a word hog kind of halo thing it's all about fired it's just backfire they should not
3220.16,3224.8, have put that in there so they added the word hog from halo and then they added the run crotch thing
3224.8,3230.24, from here so yeah yeah totally like the cover system totally yeah i got far enough in mass effect
3230.24,3238.48, to have to to do that to do the run run crotch thing and i was like no another thing is they
3238.48,3243.84, they came they took away like it in so many ways this seems like it was trying to be like
3243.84,3249.2, this is bio wears own IP but it's also just nights of the older public again like they were
3249.2,3252.56, they seemed like that's what they're trying to do is nights of the old republic but without star wars
3253.12,3258.48, and they took away some like key character development options that they just just thought was
3258.48,3264.56, so why are you going back to so no great NPC along the lines of hk 47 and really like many of them
3264.64,3269.36, what about rax i thought he's pretty cool rax is the best one but he's also like the most side character one
3270.4,3274.72, because they have been they also don't let you control them which really bugs me like are you only
3274.72,3279.36, control your main control yourself and that makes your your make sure squad members almost seem like
3280.0,3284.7999999999997, they're not there or that they're just extra powers you have because the way the game works is you
3284.7999999999997,3290.32, go into a radial menu to do anything positive the game and you just target something and then like
3290.4,3294.88, you know character a is up in the top left of the radial menu but his powers are really similar to yours
3294.88,3298.32, so if you're going to throw him who cares if a girthroer has throw so it just becomes
3298.96,3303.6800000000003, they become almost invisible in a way which really bugs me especially because you can't select them
3303.6800000000003,3308.8, and control them which I thought things are big help to make them feel more like actual characters you should
3308.8,3312.2400000000002, well you can't point to a location telling where to go but they're totally useless the AI sucks
3312.8,3315.6800000000003, that but yeah and that seems like a complete uh
3316.3199999999997,3320.56, downgrading of cousin cotore you could totally control it switched between all of a minute so
3320.56,3325.52, I'm a real micromanager player when I play when I play ballers gate I was constantly pausing I was
3325.52,3330.48, constantly giving orders to all six of my characters I played ballers gate and cotore that way
3330.48,3334.96, yeah that's just how I play so yeah as like the hardcore RPG player who likes that about by
3334.96,3340.3199999999997, or to see these things taken backwards right really bugging me right so like if I just hope
3340.4,3346.8, Dragon Age or whatever's next kind of goes back to the old way you hear that you listen
3347.44,3350.32, Heddoctors got a prescription for you
3355.44,3357.76, but there was my rant I had more
3359.76,3364.48, most of it most of it I'm not angry about anymore because like I said my experience with it was
3364.48,3368.48, starting off hating it and then eventually going okay that was pretty good I was happy to see
3368.48,3372.8, enough good stuff in here that yeah during that last week or so that you were playing it you were
3372.8,3377.92, aiming me multiple times a day and this was when we were at work where you don't have your 360 so
3377.92,3381.92, I know it was a song your mind you just kept aiming me at random I got to tell you Jeff
3381.92,3387.2, Mass Effect is really good so you were really in yeah I was really into it totally work and you
3387.2,3393.12, recommend to skip the side quests or go with them or um I stopped going with them it's it does a
3393.12,3396.64, stupid thing where it like prevents you from doing them after certain point you don't realize
3396.72,3401.2799999999997, it tells too late I won't spoil why but I hate when they do that too it's like oh so now I can't
3401.2799999999997,3408.08, even do them with you game to which are those that too because why why don't I get that why are you
3408.08,3412.7999999999997, cutting my options off here so options are good and oh that's a good great that's one reason why
3412.7999999999997,3418.24, Mario Galaxy is so good yeah that's a good Galaxy before for it after I set that up though because Jeff
3418.24,3424.96, you you had such a obvious look of just being pissed off whenever I had Kevin Carter and interrupted
3425.28,3431.12, but I wanted to show you that it was relevant. Sean said your choices you know of course
3431.12,3435.44, are to save the baby or eat the baby Kevin Carter was the famous photographer who took a picture of
3436.16,3443.28, the starving Ethiopian infant with a vulture poised behind it ready to eat it he neither saved the
3443.28,3448.08, baby nor ate the baby he took a picture of the baby he later on killed himself after it and then
3448.08,3454.32, you know and despair however by taking the photograph and having it become you know distributed
3454.4,3458.88, worldwide he ended up saving other babies so I was making a point about other options.
3458.88,3466.0, Oh I see. Yeah see there is no whatever whatever step that is what's that with that.
3467.6000000000004,3472.8, Said said national geographic ish yeah I get before we get into Mario Galaxy Ryan Scott's looking at his
3472.8,3478.1600000000003, watch. Oh he's an important man with things to do. Gosh. He has a time table. Places he go people to see
3478.1600000000003,3483.76, train. Right now are you skipping out of us in moments? Yeah I got a for the for the one thing I
3483.76,3490.48, had out there. Oh I'm on dude you got plenty of fans. I'm one of them. You're the one.
3491.5200000000004,3495.1200000000003, Are you are you leaving us right now? Yes I'm sorry I just just a point you Darren.
3495.6800000000003,3499.84, See my one fan. Well I'd show up next time on the the new lost trailers.
3500.5600000000004,3506.6400000000003, That would come back and I wanted to rant about ultimately three so. Oh god. If I don't get a change
3506.6400000000003,3510.8, of the far from our. But hey whatever. Oh it's someone it's another team. Whatever you're going to say about
3510.8,3516.5600000000004, Swim Mario Galaxy. I agree. You're in there and spirit. Yeah. You're playing a career. Yeah. Okay.
3517.44,3524.4, So we should have talked about that first. So bye. Bye. Is this our last podcast of 2007?
3524.4,3532.0, Uh it entirely uh I am sure it is. Yes. Okay. Give it up frequently. We've been getting this together
3532.0,3537.04, lately. Don't pretend where I apologize. Don't give it to anyone. So right I want to I can't even
3537.12,3546.16, top up Ryan. Oh well. Happy New Year. I will see uh. Well I'll see all you guys tomorrow. Yeah you
3546.16,3554.08, will. Everybody else. Yeah back in 2008. We. Okay. So bye Ryan. Bye Ryan.
3556.56,3563.2799999999997, What a dick. Oh he's still on the road. Oh yeah. Let's wait for a door. I was going to talk about that
3563.36,3571.52, motherfucker. Okay. Ryan's out. Mario Galaxy. Mario. That shit is good like Ryan said. So I just got
3571.52,3575.92, by we recently I traded it in for the PS3 and it was like the best thing I could have possibly done.
3577.1200000000003,3582.0, For for entertaining myself right because I wasn't playing anything on the PS3 and immediately
3582.7200000000003,3588.0, I got a bunch of games from E. J.M.'s library for we. And at first had a great time playing
3588.96,3593.2, marble mania and if someone out there is same to themselves. Oh I know that one. That's
3593.2,3602.08, corner of impact. You need to check yourself kid. That's like a super fun game. It's your
3602.08,3607.92, traditional ball roll or thing where like uh no it's marble mania. Is it like marble
3607.92,3614.48, man? It's like little it is but it's actually closer to super monkey ball. Mercury and some other
3614.48,3619.68, games like that. So basically um in marble man there isn't here and we'll be back it up. There
3619.68,3623.44, is not like marble man. This is that marble man is you basically rolled a ball. You move the
3623.44,3628.32, ball across the static environment. And these you it what it simulates is you moving the environment.
3628.32,3632.56, The way that you go to Spencer gifts or something and get a little bored with the BB in it. And
3632.56,3636.72, you're trying to run it through a maze and to get it in the hole. So the we control it perfectly
3636.72,3642.2400000000002, simulates the feeling of holding the board in your head. And it's so bizarre and that there's
3642.3199999999997,3646.7999999999997, almost no right side up. You lose all sense of orientation for the controller. You stop
3646.7999999999997,3650.72, paying attention to it. You're constantly turning it around like it's an object. You know it's an actual
3650.72,3656.3199999999997," artifact in your hands and just nudging it, lifting it by very very fine degrees to get the ball rolling"
3656.3199999999997,3662.24," a little faster, gradually moving it another way. So the feedback on that is just phenomenal."
3662.24,3667.7599999999998, Sean have you played it? No. Okay. We'll get over to it. We'll get back the Mario quick. But I
3667.7599999999998,3672.08, did want to address a few of these kind of games because the sense is you hear a lot in this building
3672.08,3675.2799999999997," that these aren't games. They don't count. They're not what we're talking about. Well yeah,"
3675.2799999999997,3679.04," I mean, before you've been brought it up, I've seen it in the star all the time. And I've just"
3679.04,3683.68," totally dismissed it. I would like why would I buy marble in here? Yeah, I mean, the universal sentiment"
3683.68,3688.0," here is that when you get a Wii you get Zelda, you get Mario, you get Metroid, you're going to get"
3688.0,3692.08, Mario Cart now in the future along with Smash Brothers and then that's it. You retire your system.
3692.08,3697.7599999999998, I actually traded it specifically to play these kinds of games. And that was one reason why
3697.84,3702.32," with a 360 already in the PC, the variety of games available on PS3 aren't really doing anything"
3702.32,3707.28, for me. I already have that outlet and I wanted games of another nature and games I can play when
3707.28,3712.48," I have visitors over people that are casual. All the reasons you know, grandma, but just instead of"
3712.48,3719.76," grandma, it's girlfriend and stuff. It's completely fun that way. It's completely enjoyable."
3719.76,3723.76," The marble mania is great. I recommend it in that respect. It does some weird things, though."
3723.76,3728.2400000000002," I mean, you play it and you're kind of say like, well, what if instead of just like getting this"
3728.2400000000002,3732.7200000000003," game out quickly, put the love into it that Nintendo would? So instead of just ramping up the"
3732.7200000000003,3736.7200000000003," difficulty uniformly so that your last hours with the game are your most frustrating,"
3738.2400000000002,3742.8," if they said, let's put a little bit more variety into this. There's a couple cool series of"
3742.8,3746.88," levels where it's like a candy lantern, you know, you're moving across cakes and infections and stuff"
3746.88,3750.6400000000003," like that. You're like, that's neat. And then it just goes with these boring kind of gray street"
3750.72,3754.48," environments, you know, and you're like, let's throw some imagination in there. Let's do some weird environments."
3756.4,3760.7999999999997," Let's, you know, make just make the game accessible to people. I also played out"
3760.7999999999997,3766.64, Elebits and Warriorware. And the thing that was disturbing to me with those while they're both fun
3766.64,3771.6, in their own way. And I say this is a huge Warriorware series fan. Is it I got this system to play
3771.6,3777.3599999999997," these kind of games and to play them socially with other people. And yet they don't, there's no multiplayer"
3777.44,3781.76," and Warriorware. I mean, that seems like it's just an unanswerable."
3783.04,3786.6400000000003," Fuck, there's a lot of, you know, why would you? Well, it's like multiplayer. You just kind of switched off"
3786.6400000000003,3790.88," the controller, right? That's about it. Yeah, there's no, there's no distinct. There's no like"
3790.88,3794.6400000000003," really they sat down and thought about how to make a multiplayer. And if you're talking about,"
3794.6400000000003,3799.2000000000003, most of your talking about little mini games that you can unlock. And that's another thing with
3799.2000000000003,3802.96," like, Elibit's save. If you want to play multiplayer, you get one level. You could play multiplayer."
3802.96,3807.04, Then you have to play the single player to unlock them. And so it's assuming that will you get
3807.04,3811.2, it. And multiplayer is the bonus. But what if I got it just to play with other people and I'm never
3811.2,3815.84, going to play this on my own. Right. Why I got it. So none lock. It's just really old and to
3815.84,3819.92, quitted mentality. And I think there's no Mario Party has the same problem. Who the hell is going to sit
3819.92,3824.88," there in place single player Mario Party to unlock more stuff. Yeah, that's how it is. Yeah,"
3824.88,3830.96," so we're stupid. And so Warriorware, though, they had, they teased at the possibilities with the"
3830.96,3836.16, gamecube version. Because it had a multiplayer mode where four people could all play and you basically
3836.24,3840.72," take turns doing the games. But then for every time you each take turns doing something,"
3840.72,3844.64, you're throwing into a mini game that you all play at once. Right. And the problem there was that
3844.64,3848.48," there weren't enough. Yeah. So if they took that and said, well, let's just throw hundreds of these"
3848.48,3852.72, where everyone's involved in. They've could have made and used the Wii mode. They could have had such
3852.72,3856.56," a fantastic game there. And instead, I think that they really, they don't have enough variety. The"
3856.56,3861.2, multiplayer is lacking. And that's kind of a let that. I totally agree. Because that was one that we played
3862.08,3865.8399999999997," twice. And then when the the normal people that come over to play these things, like, it's"
3865.92,3869.6800000000003, no longer part of our rotation of games of play. Yeah. It's like an out for a few minutes.
3869.6800000000003,3874.4," And it shouldn't there's no excuse because that game has so much potential. I mean, they've done some"
3874.4,3878.08," cool things. Actually, I think the one I was most excited about when I first saw the Wii and"
3878.08,3881.28," I was playing and I was parading around the E3 with the thing like, what's in here? What's in here?"
3881.28,3885.1200000000003," What's in here? What's in here? Oh, that's going to be so rad. Yeah, that's like reason to get to say that."
3885.1200000000003,3889.6800000000003," That was why I wanted it when it came out last years to get to play that, not for"
3890.64,3896.96," Zelda. Also now after Mario, I'm kind of inclined to want to try it, but then Rory, who just got a Wii"
3896.96,3903.2799999999997, based on hearing me going crazy about Mario. Saying that I think it's probably the best game of 2007
3903.2799999999997,3910.7999999999997," across all platforms. What single player? Hey, no, blast femur. So let's go right on crazy. That is"
3910.7999999999997,3916.08, is that your sentiment too? It's almost where the game. I haven't sat down in a sign
3916.08,3920.4," in my one two and three, but it's certainly one two or three. Wow. It's up there. Even though it"
3920.4,3926.64," makes me a little nauseous, I ended up that on my list for some reason that game like, I'm going to have to buy it."
3926.64,3931.7599999999998," Well, that's part of what's awesome about it. It's just like how insane the levels are and how"
3931.7599999999998,3936.4," well they work despite their insanity. The whole time I'm playing it, I get for the for all the"
3936.4,3940.48," reasons that I've, you know, appreciate valve in the way that they make games and the kind of"
3940.48,3944.88," games they make. You know, I've talked about that along in the podcast. I'm looking at it and saying"
3944.96,3950.4," Nintendo and Valve are like, they're just like cousins, you know, on opposite sides of the world."
3950.4,3954.96," They have to have some, and it makes me also wish that Nintendo was a little more open with the press."
3955.52,3960.7200000000003," You know, they're infamously secreted. Yeah, very much. And I would, I would guess now that their"
3960.7200000000003,3965.52," procedures are really similar. Just the whole notion of testing, putting something up at me,"
3965.52,3969.76," Lee, you know, testing it and the iterating on it, rather than just trying to throw something down."
3969.76,3974.2400000000002," Because everything in there, you feel that it's been worked. All the bugs have been worked out,"
3974.3199999999997,3978.3999999999996," of course, but it's been many people have tried it to get the difficulty just right, not to"
3978.7999999999997,3984.0," risk pissing too many people off too soon, not to alienate anyone by having them become fatigued"
3984.0,3988.08," doing a certain type of task, you know. So the variety, and even when we talk about the"
3988.08,3992.64, the pacing and the variety and halfway to up so too that works so well and it make that game so great.
3992.64,3998.9599999999996," Our compliments that I can give 100% to Mario Galaxy and in some extent, you know, even greater"
3999.84,4005.2," um, props to it just because like, you know, every time you do a level, it's like something"
4005.2,4010.08," entirely different. The interface will often change, you know, so that one moment you're basically"
4010.08,4014.48, walking on a ball and you're holding the we mode up as though and controlling it as though we're
4014.48,4019.12," a virtual joystick and where it's like, but analog so little tilt moves and stuff. And yeah,"
4019.12,4023.76, the music is perfectly timed with the rate of your acceleration. So that's that extra feedback.
4023.76,4027.76, You're getting the feedback from the controller. Then the next level suddenly you're riding on a
4027.84,4033.76," mantle, you're tilting the we-mo this way, then another is like a 2D platformer. So if we, if you don't"
4033.76,4039.28, mind like just backing up from in it because I actually haven't even seen any footage of this game.
4039.28,4044.8," And I am someone who's played, I didn't play a whole lot of sunshine even though I own it,"
4044.8,4050.88, but I did play Super Mario 64 as far as I could until I started sucking at it. But how does this
4050.96,4058.0, play as a game and how does it relate to like those two series just for a new like me and a
4058.0,4062.7200000000003," PC gamer? Did you want to answer shown? Trying to think of how to answer that. I mean, I think it's"
4062.7200000000003,4068.56," much better than sunshine, which I was in too far. I liked sunshine. I didn't think it was like"
4068.56,4072.8," that much different from Mario though, whereas this one I do feel is like, I mean Mario 64,"
4072.8,4079.28, when I say Mario. The interface and your range of movements for the majority of levels are identical
4079.36,4085.28, with the exception of this spin attack that you get by sort of flicking the we-mo in your hand.
4087.1200000000003,4090.8," And that actually feels really good, it's really natural. You're thinking like, oh, is this going"
4090.8,4095.52," to be weird? Is this actually just good for gimmick games? Or, and I don't mean gimmick in a bad"
4095.52,4100.0, way. Is it game? Games for that are just simplified control schemes. That don't have traditional
4100.0,4106.56," foundations like Mario. And it actually implements it so well that, you know, if you have the"
4106.56,4111.120000000001," fire flower right to throw a fireball rather than press a button, you make a little throwing motion."
4111.120000000001,4116.0," And it comes so casually and it's fun. I mean, you kind of, you know, you ever get that thing when"
4116.0,4120.400000000001, you go up to something and it's a crystal that's loaded with goodies and you want to do your
4120.400000000001,4123.280000000001, spin attack to break it and you kind of get that little extra bit of it in your-
4123.280000000001,4130.56," It's like, I'm excited about it. It gets those, you know. Even the split controller to that"
4130.56,4135.6," extends great in that you can stretch- Oh, I love one of your arms off the couch and you don't have to"
4135.6,4139.4400000000005," hold them both in front of you like grandma at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel. You know,"
4139.4400000000005,4142.88, you just constantly have to cross your arm. The none-checking is so comfortable.
4142.88,4147.360000000001," These are good, good solutions. So, to answer your question, it's very similar with, you know,"
4147.360000000001,4151.200000000001," you know, the triple jump, you know, that you can turn backwards and jump to go higher,"
4151.200000000001,4155.52," you know, that you can crouch and jump, that you can run it. All that moves that is still there."
4155.52,4163.200000000001," And then a whole, another moves that utilizes the new interface and it will introduce you to that"
4163.5199999999995,4168.16," in discrete levels so that you're never overwhelmed. So, so is it all of it that is making it so great"
4168.16,4175.04, to it. It's the we-moit plus the level design plus the polish. It's all of those things and it's-
4175.04,4181.84," it's perfect answer to the design of Mario, right? So, here's what I mean by that."
4181.84,4187.44," Mario's all- Mario levels always existed in this kind of weird game space. So, when it went"
4187.44,4191.76," 3D, it was kind of an issue like you have to put mountains on the sides because it's like this is just"
4191.76,4196.0, this little snippet of a world made for platforming. Right. Now we're trying to put in a natural
4196.0,4200.24," environment, a little snow globe. Is it a playground? It's a snow globe. Yeah. So, they took that and"
4200.24,4205.360000000001," they made a game and said, well, let's let's celebrate that and let's utilize that and make every"
4205.360000000001,4213.84," world very obviously a snow globe in the form of a planetoid. And then also in that, you have the"
4213.84,4219.12, ability to have the bottom of the world become useful and the world isn't useful in the round.
4219.12,4222.8," So, every level, if you think of like an ant walking around a sculpture or something,"
4222.8,4227.36, that's the place based then instead of just a snow globe where it's got a bottom to it.
4227.36,4232.5599999999995," Mm-hmm. That's part of the fun. It's just delightful to be. I mean, it does- it makes you-"
4232.5599999999995,4236.16," you want to use cheesy words. The whole time I'm playing it. You're like, it's just so-"
4236.16,4238.96, you just want to do it. Yeah. It's like- I'm a f- you've never ever heard of a
4238.96,4243.44," white fool. It's endearing. It's all these like- Grandma words, you know, but in the best way."
4243.44,4247.04," But that's- but the best in kind of games have always been that way, right?"
4247.12,4252.08," This- they always have, but this one more. So I think maybe I got to a point where"
4252.72,4257.5199999999995," kind of like, get, I understand the Nintendo worship. I was there all along. In fact,"
4257.5199999999995,4262.32," that was, you know, like, I was with you. But then when you see the kind of the cult,"
4262.32,4267.36," then Nintendo followers sort of push me away from it times, right? Because not every game that comes"
4267.36,4270.8," out of Nintendo is the discuss goal. Not at all. Right, but I mean- Right. But I mean-"
4270.8,4275.12, of Nintendo's- Right. The finest pieces of software they've ever produced. But this was like certain
4275.2,4279.92, bands that like you can't- you can't fall to the- the band for its like- like lame fans.
4279.92,4285.5199999999995," Right. The band is still good. Exactly. And it's- yeah, you can't just help it. Yeah, you can't help it."
4285.5199999999995,4290.0," That it's got some shitty fans in this. And this one kind of got me where it's like, okay, this-"
4290.0,4294.32," I mean, you just play it in all that goes away. Like, this is just so good. Every single level,"
4294.32,4299.04," I can't wait to see what's next. That it's- it's just so brilliant. Rather than- here,"
4299.04,4302.72," here's part of the thing with the variety and pasting. A lot of developers say we got a clever idea,"
4303.12,4307.52, and you can pick anyone from this game. Another one would be where you get in a bubble.
4307.52,4312.64, And then you use your remote as though it were an air blaster. And you move it like a sort of like a
4312.64,4316.96, remote wand and pressing the button gives it a little puff. And you do it in these little like-
4317.84,4321.52, and it's kind of like you're juggling bubbles with a little can of compressed air.
4321.52,4326.0, Mm-hmm. It feels so great. So most of the developers would say we're onto something here.
4326.0,4329.6, Let's figure out how we can keep people doing this for the next hour and a half. Yeah.
4329.6,4333.280000000001, And just do it over and over again. And then what's going to happen is it's going to become increasingly
4333.280000000001,4337.120000000001, difficult to the last 10 minutes of that hour. You're ready to pull your hair out and you're just
4337.120000000001,4341.84, relieved to be done with it. And so what started off is this excellent idea is now something you despise.
4342.4800000000005,4346.56," They never do that. They never let it get to that point. You know, what they do is they"
4346.56,4351.6," introduce it to you sort of let you get the taste and then they pull it away. You know, like"
4351.6,4355.6, it's so your memory that was that was fantastic. And then before you can sit there and get
4355.6,4360.240000000001," nostalgic about it, the next thing is blowing your mind even more. And you know, say the entire"
4360.240000000001,4366.400000000001," level is a giant robot like in the form of, you know, the old 1940s, 10 wind up robots and stuff."
4366.96,4371.200000000001," And the level of his body is the level, walking around it in three dimensions and saw the"
4371.200000000001,4376.160000000001," little ports that shoot rockets at you, going all around that pulling out, spinning around the"
4376.160000000001,4382.0," screws to undo them to have the limbs fall off and doing that by, you know, whipping the we"
4382.08,4388.32, motor rounds with that dumb sound was just over and over again and hitting you with it's surprising
4388.32,4392.72," you like that on that degree that when you're done, it's like I can't wait to play this again."
4392.72,4397.12," It's a lesson to everyone who wants to make a game of this quality, like just pay close attention to"
4397.12,4402.32, this and then tend to let some people in and see what you do instead of being so.
4402.32,4406.64," Will he want us to talk about it? Yeah, very much so it is. Will he want us to talk about it?"
4407.12,4411.04, So he will put a code in the game. So this is a game buying machine.
4411.04,4415.68," I should buy a Wii for this. I would. Yeah, you would and you'll feel so great. It'll give you"
4415.68,4419.52, that you know when you get a new console and you want that experience where like this is
4419.52,4424.160000000001," thank God. No buyers. Yeah, it's like the last thing on my mind. Yeah. Which is like all that was"
4424.160000000001,4429.6, there for P.S.T. for me because I had again. And if I didn't have a 360 and I didn't have a PC that
4429.6,4433.04," would have been different, I probably would have been in love. Right, but I think it was the third one I had."
4433.04,4437.12," And it's just so different, you know, another fun thing. It's kind of like you just want to"
4437.12,4440.96, blabba everything that's cool. There's no like coherence or structure to the way I'm going through this.
4440.96,4446.4," But you know when you get those, those little fireballs and you spin, you bring them into your"
4446.4,4452.24," sort of orbit by spinning around. Right. And then it's like throwing a ball around and,"
4452.24,4455.44," you know, this intro, this intro, this intro, but a force. So you're kind of like whipping the"
4455.44,4459.92, Wii mode around is though you're really spinning like a ball and string and then you hit with that into the
4460.0,4464.56," boss. It's like, it's just really cool. Like it. They did some good stuff."
4464.56,4467.4400000000005, I had games for Windows recommends.
4467.4400000000005,4471.92, That's a parbario. Mario. Yeah. There's so much about it. It's a second-looking looking in the
4471.92,4477.28," back burner. Or maybe two, which was a better thing. Wow. That's actually a really fun game for two players"
4477.28,4483.36," as well. Well, Zach and Weki. Yeah. Actually Mario's more into players. I've been tried it, but"
4483.36,4488.56," go ahead. I know, I know, I know. Like, um, the second player you think it would just be gimmicky and"
4488.64,4492.64," it's actually kind of fun for some reason. Can collect star bits, which are these little things that"
4492.64,4497.120000000001," if you point at them with the, you know, the cursor, you get them and then you can shoot them at things."
4497.120000000001,4502.72," So you can shoot them and it means just, and you can stun them by grabbing them, which is actually like"
4503.360000000001,4506.96, a great little cult mechanic. Because if you're fighting a boss or over the person who's
4506.96,4510.8," controlling Mars, like, can you grab that thing? Yeah. And then you can go, oh, yeah, I'll hold it in place for you."
4510.8,4515.120000000001," And then when the difficulty does ramp up, that seems like it would be a huge help because not only"
4515.2,4519.04," it does make it, you're worried about it's, it's worried some enough to figure out where you're"
4519.04,4522.72," going to jump and what you're going to dodge. And then when you're also trying to fight things,"
4523.28,4527.68," and there's projectiles coming at you from the distance, there are things underneath your feet."
4527.68,4532.0," I mean, that's the part where I got, I'm just trying to get a nauseous because like my buddy was"
4532.0,4535.599999999999," controlling Mario and I'm like sitting there doing the, the skeet shooting with the stars."
4536.0,4538.96," And you can't predict where he's going to go. So all of a sudden, like, the whole world"
4538.96,4544.64," spinning around you and I'm just, yeah, I'm busy doing it. Actually, my self getting nauseous in games"
4544.64,4548.4800000000005," like that, or even if the S Games to some degree, if I'm not in control direct. I see it."
4548.4800000000005,4551.68," Right, right, right, right, right, right, even watching an FPS game never affect me."
4552.08,4556.64," Mario Gals, the first game that ever got me like remotely like nauseous. As soon as I'm like in the"
4556.64,4560.08," driver's here, there's no problem at all, but like, true, watching other people is a little good."
4560.08,4565.12," Absolutely, the human mind that's based that that's rooted in a sense of an open"
4565.2,4571.92, down absolutely unduzz all of that. There. That's where the levels are just so bizarre where
4571.92,4579.76," you might be on an orb. And it's, there's nothing. It's so great. They think of like every little"
4579.76,4585.12," detail. If you're, you're fighting like Bowser on an orb, for example, right, they make the orb"
4585.12,4589.36," have transparent spots so that when you hit him and spin him and he's going around the back of it,"
4589.36,4593.44, you're able to see when he's going to be making completing the rotation and hitting your side
4593.759999999999,4597.28, of it so that you can get your spin attack ready to hit him back on the other side. But then
4597.28,4601.12, say there's a smaller orb next to it. You just jump off of yours and then suddenly
4601.679999999999,4607.44," up is entirely another direction, you know, because you're now at this angle. I'm sort of like"
4607.44,4611.5199999999995," making my arm in a 45 degree angle. And you can walk around the back of that,"
4612.24,4616.16, go to the other side of it and jump on to get another orb or another little planetoid. And
4616.96,4621.5199999999995, there are things that go even beyond that that really mess with your sense of space. And you
4621.6,4626.080000000001," always get it though. I mean, it's just, it's another testament to flexibility, even to mine,"
4626.080000000001,4630.240000000001," to just deal with different orientation. Like in the same way that when you put glasses on,"
4631.52,4635.040000000001, you put glasses on people that have mirrors in them that project the world upside down
4635.6,4640.72," and when they wear those for like 23 days or so, then it's no longer an issue for them."
4641.120000000001,4648.080000000001," Then they, their mind is able to automatically reverse the image. Really? Yes, this is real."
4648.16,4651.6," This is, yeah, the perception psychology is really interesting to me, but it's kind of like that."
4651.6,4655.84," And it just happens immediately. You're like, yeah, at first like crap, when I push down on the"
4655.84,4660.64," stick, is I going to make me move toward the screen or away from the screen to this. It makes me think of,"
4660.64,4666.5599999999995," and I'm sure it's the totally wrong, totally not true, but it's hearing you talk makes me think of portal."
4666.5599999999995,4670.08," I was just about to say, yeah, by the same kind of thing. Does it it all relate to that?"
4670.08,4675.76," It has a sense. Yeah, in terms of, in terms of, yeah, I mean, like you don't"
4676.24,4682.72," perceive space in the way you do in Mario and our world, nor is, yeah, it causes you to look at space and"
4682.72,4687.68," dimensionality in the different way. It has everything to do with it. That's yeah, very much."
4689.280000000001,4695.360000000001," It's it's like a lot to damn. I got, I got second way, he also based on people's recommendations."
4695.360000000001,4699.360000000001, And I want the reassurance from you guys that played more that the whole thing is not like the first
4699.76,4704.16, 30 minutes where it's nonstop. We're bubbles coming up with shitty dialect.
4706.24,4710.8," It's just, it's a kind of shit that people who like, I mean, it's the pillows of like,"
4710.8,4715.360000000001," underage like anime girls on them love. Well, thank you guys. It's very much about the puzzles."
4715.360000000001,4720.320000000001," Like, once you get into a puzzle, it's just like zero dialogue actually. It's just like,"
4720.320000000001,4723.2," you figuring out how to use it. You have to observe this, you have to observe this, you have to have a note"
4723.2,4727.76," this game is who are this like, Mickey, who are this. Almost agree with this. It's a place to"
4727.76,4733.360000000001," practice a picture in terms of like how you control it and what you know, but it's also more of a puzzle"
4733.5199999999995,4737.5199999999995," game than a graphic adventure. So basically, like between, so basically like you use your remote,"
4737.5199999999995,4742.16," your remote, like you would use like any other devices you interact with in the game. So if like you have a key,"
4742.96,4747.04," like you move it like into a key slot, it's a key hole and then turn it like a key and stuff like that."
4747.04,4751.759999999999," Okay. But I mean, it's about, yeah, it's about manipulating objects and using it to"
4752.4,4756.639999999999," the puzzles basically. It's really cool. Soldiers through the first 30 minutes, like, yeah, those"
4756.639999999999,4759.92," were those were bowls, so I go in a way. I got to the kind of introduce like the concepts and how it works."
4759.92,4764.64," Yeah, it was so talky. It gets old really fast. I don't know. And I couldn't skip those. I couldn't"
4764.64,4768.88, accelerate it. It's not ultimately it is not talking. Like you're probably in the part where he's
4768.88,4773.28, meeting all of his pirate friends or whatever. That's another lesson along with like making them
4773.28,4777.4400000000005, multiplayer components available from the beginning. Japanese programmers need to learn to like let us
4777.4400000000005,4783.92, skip the fucking dialogue. I don't care how good your localizers are. That shit. I don't even
4784.24,4788.64, I don't even want to live for no. Let me go the way to our games. Let me ask you a more Mario
4788.64,4795.04," question. And that's about the difficulty. Because I, I, I, if I, if I, if I am honest with myself,"
4795.84,4802.72," I, I realize with every Mario game, I am more a Mario appreciator than someone who can actually"
4803.36,4806.8, play these games very well. Because I really find them to be difficult. There's some hard
4806.8,4811.76, aspect in the super Mario 64. I didn't not come close to completing. I was afraid because I had
4811.84,4815.84," to chain in the other people commenting on how difficult the game was. So it's like sort of, uh,"
4816.400000000001,4822.320000000001, has tend to buy it. I found that it's not that difficult until late in the game. And the way that it
4822.320000000001,4829.04, works is the beginning is really just nice. And that's one thing I'd have is like to always keep in mind
4829.04,4833.92," that the whole notion of game. I mean, of course, when you, when you, when you teach a player a skill set"
4833.92,4836.88," and then you want to continue to challenge them, you assume that they're becoming increasingly"
4836.88,4841.360000000001," familiar with the controls. And you want it. But if you go too far, you always make the last"
4841.44,4845.2, parts of your game frustrating. The first part's delightful to go back to that theme. And that was
4845.2,4848.88," exactly what you want to. I'm like, I don't want this to be where it's great to pop in these"
4848.88,4853.44," worlds, get a look and then that like, you know, it's fucking swear at my TV. Right. For them,"
4853.44,4857.759999999999," like, and it's, and it's still based, it is an accurateistic. The game has like the one-ups."
4857.759999999999,4862.48," And that's part of the legacy of, of being in our arcade game and wanting your money. So, I mean,"
4862.48,4866.639999999999," that's another question I have to do, do you even need those at this point? You know, why not just let"
4866.639999999999,4871.2," me keep trying? If I want to try all night on this one thing, why can't I? Right. I mean, especially"
4871.2,4875.28, for us PC players. What does there be big rise of betrayal if they took out? They would. All the
4875.28,4879.12," people that, again, the people that sleep with the pillows with the anime girls with with cry and"
4879.12,4884.16," scream and, you know, and home to pillows and they must understand it. And it, but it doesn't matter"
4884.16,4888.48," anyway, because when you save the game, if you had, I had like 41-ups at one point and I"
4888.48,4891.76, turned the game back on the next data find that it put me right back down to five. It starts
4891.76,4895.599999999999," getting five every single time. So it's kind of like halfway there in the first place. It's like,"
4895.6,4899.52," oh, quick, fucking around. But so, so, so that tends to your question on that Jeff, it's like,"
4900.64,4906.400000000001," once you unlock a little planetoid, a little galaxy that got it and there's multiple challenges within"
4906.400000000001,4910.64," each one, you can get in and say, I really don't like this. I don't like swimming. It's too"
4910.64,4914.08, difficult for me to orient myself. Right. We're all something I'm going to go to the next one.
4914.08,4919.6," And you'll always have enough, you know, but it's based on stars as the progress. You get"
4919.6,4923.76, X amount of stars to get access to the next galaxy and there are other things that happen where
4923.76,4928.88," you get these little, I don't know, star nuggets that open up other extra galaxies. But you're"
4928.88,4934.24," all gonna say, I don't want to do this. Yeah. And then you could beat the game at what?"
4934.24,4939.68, 60 stars? Something like that. And there are like more than 100 stars. And that's when it's like
4939.68,4944.16," for, you know, the people who really like the challenge. So if you're like, I don't want to be frustrated."
4944.16,4949.6," I just want to, you know, enjoy this wonderful craftsmanship in the, the thinking and innovation"
4949.68,4954.0," and just like the aesthetic of all this, just go to 60 and don't worry about the people that tell"
4954.0,4957.6," you, oh, you didn't really beat it because you didn't get 100 more. Yeah. I mean, I have to get over my own"
4957.6,4964.4800000000005," cycle. I, you know, that does not anybody who's, you know, kind of, you know, measuring their"
4964.4800000000005,4969.280000000001," manliness by how well they did it. Mario. Mario still is not really anybody. Yeah, you don't get"
4969.280000000001,4974.240000000001," to know me to worry about that. Yeah. I mean, I have to get over my own psychological block of,"
4974.240000000001,4978.56," if I, if I complete a galaxy, we'll not complete a galaxy. If I get the first star in the galaxy,"
4978.56,4982.4800000000005," and then says, hey, look, there's another star in this galaxy. I got to go get that star."
4982.4800000000005,4987.200000000001," And even if a new galaxy is opened up, like, right, the key to start. Oh, so you can write it."
4987.200000000001,4991.52," And that's when you start, like you said, you get the later stars in the same level are the ones"
4991.52,4994.88," that are the harder ones. And those are exactly what I avoid. I never do more than, I don't think"
4994.88,5001.76," I could totally not do it. But I have that obsessive. I have that. I have that. Well, it is"
5001.76,5007.04," off topic. But I do have the same thing with guitar hero three right now. I get OCD with like,"
5007.04,5011.2," I need to get five stars on everything. Oh, I don't know. Even though I'm on hard right now,"
5011.2,5016.16, I'm looking at my medium list. And I'm seeing some three-user forves where I kind of screwed up.
5016.16,5020.48, And I'm feeling bad that I'm doing hard. Because I feel like I didn't fully finish medium yet.
5020.48,5025.84," Yeah. I don't have that with that. Different mindsets. Yeah. I mean, I can like break if I am"
5025.84,5029.84," really getting stuck on something. There's a couple that have just been like, fuck this one. I'd be like,"
5029.84,5034.96," oh, wait, I can go over here to fish planet and start over again. I'm actually compadding. I can be,"
5035.04,5038.4800000000005," I'm actually compadding. I can, that complete this thing in Mass Effect right now. So,"
5038.4800000000005,5042.56," I didn't have that trouble with Mass Effect. Taking your advice, I am not going to scow it every"
5042.56,5046.4800000000005, planet. I'm not going to take every side quest. I'm just going to mold it through some horrible
5046.4800000000005,5050.8," entry barriers and do want to decide quests. So, I think, challenge is still getting the freaking"
5050.8,5056.32," we. Yeah. I still can't really, it's so hard to get one a year later. Yeah, crazy. I know the lines"
5056.32,5061.44," to like, I have five of these things are like as long as the one I stood in the day it came out."
5061.5199999999995,5067.919999999999," It's nuts. Yeah. I'm on the whatever's called wheeler thing. So, I get the little thing in my,"
5068.799999999999,5072.719999999999," in my email box. It's at the address. I want to available. And every time I double click on it,"
5072.719999999999,5077.759999999999, it's gone already. Which is just like playing that fucking trivia game with Shane today.
5078.639999999999,5083.36," And then this podcast. Yeah. I don't want to think it was going to be on buzz the mega. Yeah, buzz the"
5083.36,5089.5199999999995, mega quest. I played the thing with Shane and Kathleen Sanders and Mike Donahau and just to spoil that
5090.400000000001,5096.72, because I guess folks who listen to one up or read one up.com could vote for who they thought was
5096.72,5103.52," going to win. And I think I did really well on the voting. Like, I think many or I'm not even been"
5103.52,5107.6," the top vote. People who were estimate your deal. People are like, oh, just for me. He's the old guy."
5107.6,5112.64," And he's and he's smart. You know, he he knows how that older guy wisdom. So, I'm going to"
5112.64,5118.56," vote for him. But in fact, the reflex action I lost on the timing. I could never buzz."
5118.56,5124.320000000001," Could not buzz. Clearly, I would suck being on jeopardy. But then that's not the buzz. Every question was"
5124.320000000001,5128.56," one that people had to answer for immediately, right? That much searching that there's thoughts."
5129.12,5136.240000000001," The questions on this game were not difficult. Okay. Yeah. So, your name colors kind of. Yeah."
5136.240000000001,5139.6," I mean, but here you guys, the fourth grader, you see that video with like,"
5140.08,5144.56," yeah, fifth graders. Can you beat up them? No, but no, that's it. It's how you smart and third"
5144.56,5147.84, grader fourth grader something. I'm getting it wrong because I've only gets fifth. Been excited to
5147.84,5152.96, it. Yeah. Yeah. And what did they ask? Do you know what the capital of Hungary is?
5153.68,5159.92," Just like, is that? Is it a place? Really? No. It's not an on it. It's increasingly,"
5159.92,5163.84," yeah. Okay. Well, I'm holding up the controller for this game. They can't see it on the podcast."
5163.84,5169.280000000001, But it's one of these big ass got a big red button and a blue orange green yellow on under it.
5169.36,5172.96," And like you would have to like, through there's such a mom joking there. Yeah, depending on"
5172.96,5179.2," you. I'm not going to say it though. Down I'll say it. Depending on the, whoa. Sorry. Depending on the"
5180.0,5185.5199999999995," the type of question in this game show. Like, sometimes it was you have to buzz the fastest, but sometimes"
5185.5199999999995,5189.599999999999, it was like press the color of the right one. And I was totally doing that old man thing of like the
5189.599999999999,5193.759999999999," question would come up and I got to look down every time like, and which ones do you want to win again?"
5193.759999999999,5197.28," And by then, like the other three people have already answered. Got to push down by"
5197.28,5202.08," vocals. Yeah, push down the butt with you're not kidding about I'm holding them. So like fuck."
5202.08,5206.24, So I actually not only did I not win for those people who voted for me. I came in last.
5206.24,5209.679999999999," Good series. Which I'm looking at the manual here, which character did you pick to the"
5209.679999999999,5214.88," mind or Napoleon or the cheerlead? I was the old lady. Okay. Oh, and then insult to injury because"
5214.88,5219.12," the video of this thing might go up because I was totally doing the old guy thing of, I don't know how"
5219.12,5223.12," to use this thing. What, hey, what's it? What's this? When everybody named themselves, you know,"
5223.2,5231.04, my name was Player 4. Ultimate loser couldn't even figure out how to enter my name. Oh man.
5232.8,5237.76," Man. Yeah, what do you got there, Sean? I've got before we forget as well. Yeah, I'm holding"
5237.76,5243.44," us here. Oh, you're right. We're in a contest and it was now two weeks ago and the prize is to win"
5243.44,5248.96, company here as a company here as a posing front. And I have three winners and each of them is going to
5248.96,5254.8," get both of those games. And the contest was, well, at the time, in that episode, we were sort of"
5254.8,5262.4, making fun of video game holiday buyers guides. And so I asked people to make their own sort of bullshit
5262.4,5268.0," entries for the guides that would sort of make, at the same make fun of how ridiculous and overpriced"
5268.0,5276.16, and undesirable and things in these guides are and how also how frequently the writeups are basically
5276.24,5282.0, pasted PR press release information. I do want to extend extra special kudos to the people who
5282.0,5289.12," link to our own shitty writeups on one up.com. Oh, you mean like this one that you guys read? Well,"
5289.12,5293.5199999999995," it wasn't, I mean, that's the part of the thing. It's a real hard part. It was the network and we were like,"
5293.5199999999995,5297.5199999999995," right, we meant to say, I mean, I meant to say that we have our own glass houses and right,"
5297.5199999999995,5304.639999999999," thing is like I have no problem making fun of those. Right. So here, I haven't even, here, here,"
5304.64,5310.8, the winner. So one of them goes to kid Kainland. He actually gave three or four separate entries.
5310.8,5316.4800000000005," And any of them was a contender for winner. El 1 is the true Messiah, Stainglass window."
5316.4800000000005,5325.4400000000005," And the price is $899.99. And his writeup was, are you sick and tired of the frigid breeze"
5325.4400000000005,5329.84, blowing through the gaping hole in your bedroom wall? Are you fed up with being fed upon in your
5329.84,5333.92, sleep by transient mosquitoes and buzzards? Are you desperately searching for a way to show
5334.0,5338.24, your friends and family how truly hardcore you are? And is your ultra religious mom worried that
5338.24,5343.68," your obsession with halo is reaching unhealthy levels? At last, for a modest fee, you can decorate your"
5343.68,5348.8, halo sanctuary with a sleek translucent effigy of your true savior. Show your mom what a real
5348.8,5353.92, Messiah looks like. What has her got ever done for you anyway? What did Jesus ever do a wheeled?
5353.92,5361.4400000000005, Loves and fish? Boaring? Making mom cry. A question or own faith by praying aloud to the Stainglass
5361.44,5365.44, image of a fictional video game character? Decorating your chosen religion is the
5365.44,5373.759999999999, bombination and in front to the master chief. So it was a master chief. So is there a picture with
5373.759999999999,5376.96," that that would have been awesome? There is. Oh there is. Oh no, it's because someone made a real"
5377.599999999999,5381.28," yeah. So if you go, if anyone wants to see the pictures for these, just go to the one-up"
5381.28,5386.0," forums and you'll see if the red sticky at the top says GFW radio contest, company here is contest."
5386.48,5390.24," And this one's probably like page three or four. And it's a nice, pester chief Stainglass."
5390.8,5395.04, Looks kind of nice. He also had one on a real bench and I won't read the right up.
5395.04,5399.679999999999, It was rock band for PC and what he did was he took the image of the guys playing the
5399.679999999999,5406.5599999999995, shatterrun box from that. So they're all playing the rock band box. But instead there's like
5407.84,5412.48," guitars laid out like keyboard. The guys playing it like Stevie Wonder, you know like just like kind of"
5413.2,5417.28, y'all again. And then another one like the guys like holding a microphone like as he's like
5417.599999999999,5424.88, shot this screen. And then he's just talking. It's the picture alone. Loan was worth it.
5427.04,5431.599999999999, The coffee mug gave a few that were pretty good. He's he's getting one of the the price packs.
5431.599999999999,5436.4, He has this is a direct rep on something you read Jeff about the the lead shirts. So he has all
5436.4,5442.0, your base are belong to us T-shirt. Where's that the Dorkey booth at the flea market between the
5442.08,5447.84, Evangelion DVDs and the hundred bullets trades. The price is $27. It's making you come back.
5447.84,5451.36, Let your friends in on the greatest internet phenomenon of all time. Remember mind them.
5451.36,5456.08, Why they subscribe to CompyServe. Nothing says it should get signal like a classic inside joke.
5456.08,5461.76, And this shirt depicts the most hilarious moment in video game and internet history as of 2002.
5461.76,5466.48, This piece is timeless with its pixelated text. The yellow phone and the blue or black shirt symbolizes
5466.48,5471.12, the stark difference between Japanese and English languages. Gitchery English on and set us the
5472.0,5478.72, up as the bomb for someone you love. This holiday season. Then Panda Claus is the third winner.
5479.76,5484.96, He had a bunch as well. And one of them was that thing Protado salad.
5484.96,5495.68, Oh God. It was that we game with like a dog hoping a guy. That was not the winning entry. That's not
5495.68,5502.08, good for radio. But I had fun. So he gives you the official Epic Games featureist at Combat
5502.08,5510.56, Armor for 174.95. That's pretty good deal. This combat armor is just in time for this 2007 holiday
5510.56,5515.360000000001, season. Epic's game is finally released a fully functional version of their patented featureist
5515.360000000001,5520.320000000001, at Combat Armor designed for office and recreational use. Well this is a shitty gift for the ones
5520.320000000001,5525.4400000000005," you love. If you actually like unreal games, you probably don't have any friends or family"
5525.679999999999,5533.12," friends. Famously use on. And we do not, you know, these are not a GFW opinion. These are the"
5533.12,5540.24, the conscious. Nice display. Famously used in nearly every Epic Games since just Jack
5540.24,5544.96, Rabbit 2. This armor is a completely original piece of classical design that merges sleek aesthetics
5544.96,5549.839999999999, with brilliant function to provide you with a cool and durable protection against the poorly
5549.839999999999,5554.719999999999, design weapons of the future. Well unable to stop any modern projectiles that chess shoulder armor
5554.8,5559.6, will be a valuable win if 50 years or so suspiciously struggled like aliens somehow alter the
5559.6,5564.96," physical, the universal physics that govern chemistry we use on our planet to create gun power"
5564.96,5569.280000000001, and will be forced to design a new type of shotgun that slowly fires a heart rubber pellet
5569.280000000001,5574.72," rather in traditional buckshot. A new and less deadly automatic nerve gun, a biffy sewage launcher,"
5574.72,5580.240000000001," a photonic energy rifle, a photonic submachine gun, a slow moving rocket launcher for some reason,"
5580.32,5587.84, a long range of electricity rifle. While this retarded future is uncertain and too far off for you
5587.84,5592.8," to give a shit, the armor still totally looks you make like a generic badass. So buy it for yourself"
5592.8,5598.719999999999," anyway in screen. If yeah, in order. So buy it for yourself in screen at the end, oh, whatever you"
5598.719999999999,5606.719999999999, do something mildly not worthy. Nice. Those are the winners you guys all send them PMs and I'll put my
5606.8,5612.400000000001, work email in there for you give me your addresses and I'll send you some games. Congratulations.
5612.400000000001,5616.8," Congratulations. I'll actually know what that last one. I'm going to throw a, I'm going to throw"
5616.8,5620.56," a keyboard and mouse for those guys because that might go in fact. Yeah, we've got some extra wolf king"
5620.56,5626.0," keyboard. Yeah. I think he's wearing that armor. Wolf king. Well, if you're a wolf king,"
5626.0,5631.84, it's like these keyboards that are they're like on the dinner plate. Just one of these like
5631.84,5637.360000000001, circular pads. I hate that. But what I love about these is that it has pink trim like in
5637.360000000001,5641.76, honor of the frag gul. So you can. But it doesn't even say that the press does have cheap. They are
5641.76,5645.6," that the press releases it, but they couldn't even afford to put that on the packaging. It doesn't"
5645.6,5651.4400000000005," even, it's just like here's the Wolf King. Why do people keep thinking? It's been wonder if they"
5652.4800000000005,5658.72, accidentally made it with pink and then like shit. So I totally started explaining stuff. He's
5658.8,5675.360000000001," crap on it. Yeah, the, we are the green. All the newfangled keyboards that baffle"
5675.360000000001,5679.92, boggle my mind. Gaming accessories are the worst offenders though for the landfill shit. Yeah.
5679.92,5683.52, Like did you see that they make condoms for weak controllers?
5683.52,5688.080000000001, Two. It's like what? It's like talking about a rubber that you slip over your weak
5688.080000000001,5692.0, controllers. You get a better grip on it or that you don't like like damage your controller when
5692.0,5696.400000000001," you spas out and hit a glass on the table. Oh yeah, I've seen those. I think that was the second thing"
5696.400000000001,5702.8," to Nintendo offered after the thicker strings or whatever didn't quite work out. I'm like, who"
5702.8,5708.160000000001," is still throwing these at TV isn't people? Yeah. And like now they're like, okay, well, now"
5708.160000000001,5712.080000000001," here's some rubber crappy can put around and so at least you won't make any, you know, I just"
5712.08,5718.5599999999995, don't understand like the the whole cottage industry of people making controllers that like try
5718.5599999999995,5725.04," to do something, you know, this controller you wear on your neck. It's a gift. You left your left"
5725.04,5731.04," left your left leg. It's like simulating a double click. Finally, Rick Allen can play this game."
5731.04,5735.36, Look at Dan's office and he's got this shit. It looks like that fucking that movie dead ringers.
5735.36,5739.5199999999995, You know what? We're kind of galactic tools. It's like this.
5739.52,5746.080000000001," That's actually Jeff. Those are actually weird. Oh, they're like a different podcast."
5746.88,5751.68, They're other classics are a magnifying glass for your screen for your gameplay. Remember my
5751.68,5755.84," god? Yeah, you're like literally a magnifying glass that you can't remember that. And then a light"
5755.84,5760.160000000001," that you light above their light. So they did look like you know either better like a dentist tools,"
5760.160000000001,5764.8," you know, all the I had one of those lights. I had a light. You had all these like strap on's on top of your"
5764.8,5769.84, skin. But the light was mandatory. You had a good way of getting it. You're sitting in the middle
5769.84,5775.52, of like a fucking supernova and you can't just screw you in. All right. And you feel really the best.
5775.52,5780.24, The best ever was a Gameweight cartridge changer. And what? Okay. So check this out. Like it.
5780.24,5784.8, Because it's such a fucking hassle to pull a cartridge out of a game. Put another one in.
5785.6,5790.56, There's this thing that's roughly twice the size of the Gameboy itself. And it has three
5790.64,5794.4800000000005," cartridge slots. And not only that. So ridiculous that one is on this side, on the right,"
5794.4800000000005,5799.04, one's on the left and there's one on the top. So then you plug this piece of shit into your
5799.04,5804.64, Gameboy. And then you have you then plug three games into that at once. And there's like a little
5804.64,5808.64," selector space. Oh, like a toggle. Do you want to play the game in slot one, two or three? But so you've"
5808.64,5814.320000000001, now added like three pounds to your your portable device to hold to save you the trouble of like
5814.320000000001,5819.04, maybe you don't want to cart the other two games along. All right. Pocket. It's the whole like are you tired?
5819.2,5824.64, It's wiping your ass. You know like the info commercial trying to tell you trying to create some
5824.64,5830.24, imaginary need. It's like the guys always like trying to get his hand get his ass. But you can't do it.
5830.24,5834.4, So now. Because they're trying to give you some solution to alternative to toilet paper.
5835.44,5838.88," Okay, you know what actually you just reminded me of like this one thing when I first started out in"
5838.88,5843.04, journalism years and years ago at some like business magazine. I got this press release was like some
5843.04,5847.76, dude in Canada and it was like obviously he made it himself as a pick. It was a press release and I
5848.320000000001,5853.92, photo of a mannequin head with and then no shit. I was like imagine like the top part of a toilet bowl
5853.92,5859.52, like the seat part around the mannequins head and then there's a little metal bar coming out of it and then
5859.52,5864.08, you velcro on this little strap and then you put velcro on the back of your hand your phone
5865.04,5867.76, and yeah. Yeah. Shop is kinky dog. Why?
5869.84,5873.12, There's like a business magazine and some nice sense. It's like legitimately expecting like
5873.12,5876.72," all my right that shit up. So wait, that's how that's how you would. What was it supposed to be?"
5877.2,5883.92, It was supposed to hold a phone close to your head. It's like a hands-free turn hands turn your phone into
5883.92,5887.68, a hands-free phone but they couldn't they couldn't actually pay they couldn't find a real model
5887.68,5892.400000000001, and we voluntarily wear this contraption so they got a mannequin head to where the toilet seat on his head.
5893.12,5898.400000000001," Well, they just bend a wire around your head. Why did they have to put a toilet seat somewhere around?"
5899.76,5903.92," That's like a good invention. No, it's real the big John toilet seat. You've seen that. I posted a"
5904.0,5910.08, piss. Oh yeah. It's a toilet seat because many people in America's asses at this point in the new century to big are
5910.08,5917.84," yeah, the two standard big for the flimsy old school toilet seat. So they make the big John seat and it's a lot of plastic there."
5917.84,5922.32, Yeah. They're at your decline of the USM pilot. A lot of the Congress are over.
5922.32,5924.64, Yeah. Yeah. They're going to be a big. Do you agree with the intranet?
5924.64,5930.16, That the doos nook does have the big John seat in it. Then I just I ain't going to play in it. I hear it.
5931.12,5936.32, Yeah. They missed the boat. It's not too late. They're still pretty alpha.
5937.5199999999995,5943.84, Someone took a that picture and they animated like one of you know how people end up picking on a foreign
5943.84,5951.04, poster. Yeah. I was on there was that one guy in for a week. His face appeared and everyone's out
5951.04,5954.96, and everyone's signature's down in the bottom and someone took the little John seat and they gave
5954.96,5960.08, from the brochure like a view of the bottom. So that you could see your ass because what they were
5960.08,5963.92, trying to do is make the case that your ass is seriously too big for a normal toilet seat.
5963.92,5970.0, And if I ever I tell you yeah so the seat was from down within the bowl like a ball cam.
5970.0,5973.92, So they took that and they photoshopped so they did sheaks with part and then this guy
5973.92,5977.2, this poster's face with a mornish. But in between the cheese.
5979.36,5981.92, I don't know you know you've become a mess. Just board pariah.
5983.5199999999995,5985.36, Don't don't come back again. Yeah.
5986.32,5989.44, We're good to go. We're done. We're done. We're good to go. Yeah.
5989.44,5991.12, That's a good Christmas message everyone.
5992.32,5998.0, Whatever they celebrate happy holidays. Last week we did we got a whole lot of support from the gaming
5998.0,6004.0," age form fans. Yes, we did. They were upset that our podcast and come out and our one-up fans"
6004.0,6009.12," is always so those two communities get a special thanks. Yes, thank you guys. Right."
6010.08,6016.88, In 2008 we resolved to podcast. Well let's keep it something we can actually meet once a week at least.
6016.88,6022.16," No, I was going to say twice a month. Now we've been good mostly. We've been trying to go every week."
6022.16,6027.92, We've had a fairly hell of schedule. Last week was the first time we skipped in a very long time.
6027.92,6031.92, We've always been late. I don't think we're going to. Yeah. No. We did.
6031.92,6038.72, If it helps explain it. Sean just you literally finish shipping the last page for an issue.
6039.12,6043.44, Minutes before we walked in here. Yeah. I'm a life-finished issue and then he walked
6043.44,6047.44," basically straight from turning in the last page and said, okay, I am finally ready. Yeah."
6047.44,6051.84, So that's the kind of dedication we have. And we're here late. We're all state. It's like almost what?
6051.84,6055.2, Seven. It is almost seven. It is almost seven. PM. We have our loved ones.
6055.2,6059.28, Family. But waiting for us normally we try to go here. It's not do that. And that's a problem we
6059.28,6063.5199999999995, recorded in the day and it's like it's space. The usage of the space is at a premium system. Yeah.
6063.5199999999995,6066.96," It's got to get in here. So if you don't like us, blame us. Sports and only."
6067.44,6071.2, They're always kicking aside here. Are they are new enemies? Yeah. They're the
6071.2,6074.88," general of my Jeff. He's sitting there stone faced. Yeah. No. You're the one who's like,"
6074.88,6079.2," oh, we got to go after them now. That's how you guys blogging about how he thinks he's going to be the best."
6079.2,6081.44, I'm not stone faced. So I was trying to think how to rip them hard.
6083.6,6086.08," I know what else to say. I was in Fox Sports and I'm like,"
6087.28,6093.52," yeah, they're the new. They're the wereatronats that worked before. Yeah. Yeah. If you're a"
6093.52,6100.0," dedicated GFW fan, I recommend you go to Todd's and EGUS blog. I want up that calm and tell him that"
6100.0,6104.72," his podcast is full shit. And GFW is actually number one. If you're a true fan,"
6104.72,6112.64," you have a straight kid. Jeff, it means that's a lot. Just kidding. I love you. You're just kidding."
6113.280000000001,6116.64," We're just about that. Just kidding. That was just kidding. Oh, no."
6116.64,6120.64," I was like, what your bull negatives, you know, is what's really mean. Yeah. Who knows?"
6121.04,6128.240000000001," Um, we got one more thing to say before we got Mr. Dan Gladstone, who's been kind of in and out."
6128.240000000001,6133.200000000001, I'll see out the last number of weeks. He's a very busy man. Miss Gladstone.
6134.4800000000005,6138.320000000001," This is part of, I guess I should say, like, I feel like the luckiest man on the face of the earth."
6138.320000000001,6145.200000000001," But the short version is as my last podcast guys. I'm going to miss GFW. But I'm, I'm heading out."
6145.92,6153.92," Dan Gladstone is getting on his, uh, his robot horse, but that he got delivered from"
6153.92,6158.0, some more and he's gulping off to another magazine. Can you say where?
6158.72,6162.639999999999," Um, I took care of me. You can say where. All right. Not any gamer."
6164.72,6172.24," No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm actually going to PC world. So, uh, right. Uh, a pretty straight up"
6172.32,6177.28," tech magazine, right? Tech magazine. It's, it's a lot more mainstream. And, uh, hopefully I can, I can,"
6177.28,6181.599999999999," I could explain them to love that is video games and break it down to a whole different audience,"
6181.599999999999,6185.76, which I think is going to be a really interesting challenge. Right. So you still be doing games coverage?
6185.76,6190.88," Well, not so much. I'm going to do, like, I'm going to try to do some, but I, you know, obviously,"
