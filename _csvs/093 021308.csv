157.86,161.86," Well, first of all, we need to get this done."
161.86,164.86, The infamous cab ride that Sean and I had weeks ago.
164.86,165.86, You've been teasing this.
165.86,166.86, We've been teasing that.
167.86,168.86," Hey,さ's."
168.86,169.86, There's at least a few sparsitis.
173.86,175.86, There'll be a wait to come in.
175.86,177.86, On the chances.
177.86,180.86, I will be looking forward to the first weeks.
180.86,181.86, Umm.
181.86,183.86, Thank you.
189.86,190.86,這是.
190.86,192.86, The police emergent.
192.86,193.86, Also she has herself.
193.86,194.86, Maybe she has her size?
194.86,197.06, and Emory Bale California to see sport.
197.06,197.9, Right.
197.9,199.02, And we want to let the talk after the shoot
199.02,201.70000000000002," to have a story, we can get into sport."
201.70000000000002,202.70000000000002, Right.
202.70000000000002,206.74," So after the sport event, which we will talk about later,"
206.74,210.5," we took a cab ride home back to Berkeley, Sean and I."
210.5,213.70000000000002," And that, oh wait, who else was in the cab with us?"
213.70000000000002,216.54000000000002, Says are from Game Videos and the one-up show.
216.54000000000002,217.54000000000002, That's right.
217.54000000000002,219.74," In fact, that's how the conversation started, right?"
219.74,221.22000000000003, Because the three of us got into this cab.
221.22000000000003,223.82000000000002, We had the call cab at like 10.30 at night
223.82,227.42, and Emory built from the Amtrak station
227.42,228.85999999999999," and Emory built, train station."
228.85999999999999,232.73999999999998, This cab comes and the three of us get in there
232.73999999999998,234.98, and says our house is big camera.
234.98,236.42, A big nice HD.
236.42,237.01999999999998, Right.
237.01999999999998,239.01999999999998, Really nice video camera that he puts in the cab
239.01999999999998,240.45999999999998, he's front seat and the first thing
240.45999999999998,243.29999999999998," that the cab says is, what is it?"
243.29999999999998,246.26," Like, are you guys cops or what is it?"
246.26,247.1," Well, is it?"
247.1,248.42, He gave us a choice of two.
248.42,249.94," I don't know how well we can do the accent,"
249.94,251.26, but he was an Arab guy.
251.26,252.1, Yeah.
252.1,253.26," He ate a thick airbags and he's like,"
253.26,254.1, are you police?
255.34,256.18, Right.
256.98,257.82, No.
257.82,258.98, Yeah.
258.98,260.09999999999997, Not a good way to start a conversation.
260.09999999999997,262.3, He had another choice though.
262.3,264.42, He was taking a second guess with the video.
264.42,265.3," Well, yeah, what was it?"
265.3,267.21999999999997," Like, do you thought we were like record and porn"
267.21999999999997,268.06, or something?
268.06,268.9," So, yeah."
268.9,269.74," Well, that's the option."
269.74,271.09999999999997, It was the least part of the porn or what?
271.09999999999997,274.26," Yeah, we were like now we're like a media company, you know?"
274.26,276.34, Then we said media then what it was something else
276.34,277.9," where did he was, too?"
277.9,278.9," Or I don't know, it was weird."
278.9,279.86, He thought weird.
279.86,282.21999999999997, Why would we have a HD camera for police anyway?
282.22,283.62," Like maybe detectives or something,"
283.62,286.22, but they've only seen the show cops.
286.22,288.90000000000003," Well, the reason is because all the rest of what he said"
288.90000000000003,290.26000000000005, was police are related.
290.26000000000005,291.5, He thought you were Chris Hanson
291.5,295.02000000000004, and we were going to drive him over to sell his DSL.
295.02000000000004,298.3," Yeah, so you take it from here."
298.3,299.66, Where'd it go from here?
299.66,300.66, Let's try to remember.
300.66,303.5," Well, first off, he just starts in general."
303.5,304.42," It's not, I don't know."
304.42,306.46000000000004, Some people like talking if cavies.
306.46000000000004,307.3," Yeah, there's don't."
307.3,309.26000000000005, I'm in the party where I'd rather just sit there
309.26000000000005,312.18, and listen to whatever messed up music's going.
312.18,314.94, And just enjoy the ride.
314.94,317.22, He was one of those talkie cabbys.
317.22,319.46," Yeah, he was talk the whole way."
319.46,324.02, He started off with this like hot story of how he had witnessed
324.02,327.54," a hit and run and then he decided, well, his vehicle wasn't struck."
327.54,330.54," He decided that he was going to be like a vigilante,"
330.54,334.22," you know, cab driving the punisher and chasing guy down."
334.22,335.78000000000003," So because he sees something wrong,"
335.78000000000003,338.22," he's not, he's a kind of guy that's got to do something."
338.22,339.42," Yeah, you know."
339.42,341.78000000000003," You would, which he emphasized over and over."
341.78,345.29999999999995," That was this, yeah, he had, he had like a chorus to his story."
345.29999999999995,348.73999999999995," That he would be like the Chris Rock stand up routine, you know."
348.73999999999995,349.73999999999995, Yeah.
349.73999999999995,350.73999999999995, Maybe some people don't do anything.
350.73999999999995,352.38, I'm the kind of guy he's got to do something.
352.38,353.38, I see something wrong.
353.38,354.38, I'm going to fix it.
354.38,359.82," So he's like, he's describing this high speed chase and, you know,"
359.82,363.34," like, pull in the handbrake and flip in 180s around intersections,"
363.34,366.02," shit and chasing a guy through a tunnel,"
366.02,367.53999999999996, eventually losing him.
367.53999999999996,371.73999999999995," But then having going back to the scene and calling the police,"
372.1,375.26, and a large piece of the vehicle's bumper was there.
375.26,377.18, It had the license plate on it or something.
377.18,377.54, Great.
377.54,379.98, And understanding that like the fear of a sort of sitting in the back seat.
379.98,382.14," And we, nothing prompted this."
383.14,386.18," It wasn't, it was like a complete one-sided conversation."
386.18,387.90000000000003, You just start telling us a story.
387.90000000000003,391.90000000000003," So then he's like, they ended up, I mean, we could, we could throw the time"
391.90000000000003,394.02, laps on this part of the story because it went on and on.
394.02,400.62," But in the end result, they tracked the car back to like the house or something."
400.62,403.5, And they knock on the door and it'll police officer knocks on the door and it's like
403.5,407.74, some like quite old guy and his slippers and answers and it turns out it was a son
407.74,412.78000000000003, pulled the shenanigans and then just slipped the cab driver or thought he did and then went
412.78000000000003,413.78000000000003, back home.
413.78000000000003,418.14," So, they're like, okay, like that was the build up, you know, and then he just, again,"
418.14,422.62," it was emphasizing, couldn't witness a crime and not do something to prevent it."
422.62,425.06," And then all of a sudden he says,"
425.06,428.18," you know what, I would do anything for this country."
428.18,433.18," And like, okay, well that's cool."
433.18,437.66," Like we did question that, you know, and then all of a sudden he's like, but I'm not a"
437.66,438.66, snitch.
438.66,445.1," And then he starts saying, you know what, then the police put, I don't know if it was like"
445.1,448.1," right after, but then he starts saying he's like, one time, he's like, that's one thing."
448.1,453.02," I got thrown in jail because, but no, no, okay, I'm fucking it all up."
453.02,454.58, This is why it was so bizarre.
454.58,459.65999999999997," And he says, you know, we're just commenting on him on his good deeds, you know, on"
459.65999999999997,462.14," his like, upper, yeah, we're just like, cumoring him."
462.14,463.14, And that's great.
463.14,468.74," And he's like, yeah, I, I, I know all the police and he's like, but one time they threw"
468.74,471.21999999999997," me in jail and we're like, oh, whoa, why was that?"
471.21999999999997,472.21999999999997, You're all gonna nervous.
472.21999999999997,473.21999999999997," Yeah, I'm against it."
473.21999999999997,474.21999999999997, How are you gonna?
474.21999999999997,477.21999999999997," You don't really get a fucking horror movie, it's way to something."
477.21999999999997,478.21999999999997," Yeah, I'm not."
478.21999999999997,484.5," And then he's like, because I wouldn't talk or like, that's weird."
484.5,488.3," It's like, I don't know if anyone that's got put in jail for not saying something."
488.3,489.78," Then he's like, I don't snitch."
489.78,490.78," Yeah, I'm no snitch."
490.78,494.58," And he's like, I would do anything for this country, but I won't snitch."
494.58,498.86," And then he, it sounded like they were, it's like they were trying to turn him into being"
498.86,501.9," an informant against, right, you know, terrorists."
501.9,504.78," Yeah, he was like, turned into a whole natural security thing."
504.78,508.86," And he won't, he's no snitch, you know, he loves this country, but he's no snitch."
508.86,512.42," So at that point, then we're starting to trickle off, he says, ours the first to get out."
512.42,513.74, And then we're sitting there.
513.74,516.86," And I know Jeff and I were both looking at each other like, shit, who's going to be"
516.86,517.86, the last one?
517.86,518.86," Yeah, I know."
518.86,522.5, And I know it was me because I lived the forest away.
522.5,525.3," And then we started pulling this maneuver, where I was like, oh, well, Jeff, you're"
525.3,529.3399999999999," using your corporate card for this, this cat, maybe you want to swing my plays for it."
529.3399999999999,533.6999999999999," And then the cabby hears that and he goes, no, no, he can just pay and then I'll let you"
533.6999999999999,534.6999999999999, out after you.
534.6999999999999,535.6999999999999," Yeah, I do know."
535.6999999999999,536.6999999999999," Yes, fuck man."
536.6999999999999,540.18," So then he is Shawn, he's got another story after that."
540.18,541.8199999999999, And then it's that he got.
541.82,546.7800000000001," Yeah, that he witnessed, he saved some guy from getting, or some guy was getting"
546.7800000000001,547.7800000000001, stabbed.
547.7800000000001,549.38, He pulled over and saved his life.
549.38,551.38," Yeah, we found the cop part out later."
551.38,552.38, Yeah.
552.38,554.58," So he's again, you know, so I couldn't let it happen."
554.58,556.34," You know, as if my fellow man, I couldn't let him happen."
556.34,557.98," We're like, wow, man."
557.98,562.58, You got balls for one chasing another car after hitting run in Oakland.
562.58,563.58, I wouldn't fucking do that.
563.58,564.58," Oh, be honest with you."
564.58,565.58, And then you live in Oakland too.
565.58,566.58, Would you do that?
566.58,567.58, Hell no.
567.58,568.58, Fuck no.
568.58,570.7800000000001," So he, we're like, you're one."
571.54,575.54," It's Duke Nukem would say, falls of steel."
575.54,578.3," And then he's like, oh, yeah, and it was a police officer, too."
578.3,580.18," Yeah, it was a police officer who got stabbed."
580.18,584.9399999999999," And this cabbie super cabbie here saved, saved the stab policemen."
584.9399999999999,589.26," And he's got like, so now he's got some, you know, maybe it all happened with it"
589.26,590.26, with the police officer.
590.26,591.5799999999999, And he'll stop in his store.
591.5799999999999,592.8199999999999, He could talk about his store.
592.8199999999999,593.5799999999999, Right.
593.5799999999999,595.42, He's going to come into the story later.
595.42,596.9, And then so this is going on.
596.9,600.06," And over here, I'm just like, Jeff, you keep looking at me with this fucked up"
600.06,601.06, face.
601.06,603.78," No, I'm like, dude, the cab driver's looking in a rear mirror every two seconds."
603.78,606.14, I'm not going to change like looks with you.
606.14,607.14, I'm rolling.
607.14,608.14," Fuck, I can't look at it."
608.14,611.8599999999999," I'm like, he's doing like, uh, can you believe this guy?"
611.8599999999999,612.8599999999999, Yeah.
612.8599999999999,614.14, And then he called me on it at a one point.
614.14,615.14, He got kicked.
615.14,616.14," Yeah, yeah."
616.14,617.14," He was like, do I talk too much?"
617.14,619.14," Yeah, that was weird because when you meet someone who's just like,"
619.14,620.14," yeah, I'm looned."
620.14,621.14, That's one thing.
621.14,622.14, But when they're aware that they're scaring you.
622.14,623.14, Yeah.
623.14,624.14, And then they keep doing it.
624.14,628.2199999999999," Yeah, he might have caught my, like, look of like, uh, what the hell's gone on this"
628.22,629.22, cab.
629.22,630.26," I might talk, do I talk too much?"
630.26,631.6600000000001, Maybe I shouldn't talk so much.
631.6600000000001,633.3000000000001, And then he started another story.
633.3000000000001,634.3000000000001, Yeah.
634.3000000000001,639.26," So eventually, you get out and then you go to pay with your card and he wasn't prepared"
639.26,643.22," for that and he's like, well, you know, can you, can you, uh, I'm going to, I'm going"
643.22,645.86, to rub your card on a piece of paper.
645.86,649.7," But it wasn't even like, like, you know, paper, whatever, you know, it was like a piece"
649.7,654.1," of, he was doing some like old school, uh, it was the doctor science show."
654.1,655.74, So that old guy's day on rubings.
655.74,656.74, Yeah.
656.74,660.98," So you take a quarter and rub a pencil over to break, he pulled that maneuver on it."
660.98,662.78," And then he said, it's going to be funded."
662.78,665.38, It's going to show up to a fucking grocery store.
665.38,666.38, Yeah.
666.38,670.62," So it's, you know, I don't have my, I don't have my official, my visa set up for this cab"
670.62,671.62, for this cab.
671.62,673.26, So it's going to go to my store.
673.26,675.58," So when you get your bill, it's going to say like something groceries."
675.58,676.58, It's in the grocery store.
676.58,678.26, She was a secret grocery store.
678.26,679.26, Right.
679.26,680.26, That's great.
680.26,681.74, What's no doubt is some kind of terrorist front.
681.74,686.3, I'm probably on some most wanted one.
686.3,690.98," Oh, do anyway."
690.98,693.58, That was just a weird end to the sport event.
693.58,700.46," I was like, actually, you know that, you're like, am I just being an idiot?"
700.46,702.02," You know, like, dude, this guy's just chill."
702.02,703.98," And he's just like, he's got good stories."
703.98,704.98, The fucking storyteller.
704.98,706.1800000000001, And I can appreciate that.
706.1800000000001,707.58, But it actually crossed my mind.
707.58,711.62," I like, when we were going, I made sure I was, I didn't have my seatbelt on and the door"
711.62,716.66, was unlocked in case I had to kick it open and pull it over and fucking escape.
716.66,718.66, Like some GTA shit.
718.66,722.98," But he basically, he just kept talking about his store because I asked him, like, I was like,"
722.98,725.94," man, do you got to go to your store when you get off the shift tonight?"
725.94,729.0600000000001, And then he was just saying how his brother runs the store mainly.
729.0600000000001,731.86, And he goes in there now and then he let me out.
731.86,732.86," And I was like, good night."
732.86,736.5," Oh, and then he kept giving me tons of his cards telling him anytime I need a cab ride."
736.5,737.5, And he called me.
737.5,741.5," And I was like, I was thinking about after I'm, I'm just going to go to the gym."
741.5,742.5, I'm still alive.
742.5,748.1," And if you got stabbed, he'd be a good guy to have around."
748.1,749.94," That's no joke, man."
749.94,752.42, Everyone had that cab ride before.
752.42,753.42, Yeah.
753.42,754.78, He definitely was that cab ride.
754.78,758.42," And it was just one of those like, you know, I've had those many times before."
758.42,759.7," And you know, we were at that event."
759.7,760.7, It was 10 o'clock at night.
760.7,761.7, It was a weekday.
761.7,762.7," And I was like, oh, no."
762.7,764.26, It's just going to be one of those rides.
764.26,765.82, And then it was.
765.82,767.62, Can't you just drive?
767.62,768.62, Yes.
769.58,772.14, So that was coming back from sport.
772.14,772.86, Yeah.
772.86,777.18," So now we can talk about sport going backwards in time, going backwards in time."
777.18,779.18, That's a good.
779.18,780.18, Did you like sport?
780.18,782.18, I did like sport.
782.18,785.02," I said it on, I said it on one up here."
785.02,789.22," So we could go and head, garnet scoff at me or whatever about it."
789.22,790.22, But the series?
790.22,791.22, Yeah.
791.22,792.22, You could talk about that when you talk.
792.22,793.86, I just got into those guys.
793.86,795.86, They're scoffing at you about sport.
795.86,796.86, Yep.
796.86,797.86, A little bit.
797.86,798.54, Why?
798.54,802.6999999999999, I guess it's maybe the backlash of it being so long since since anybody
802.6999999999999,807.8199999999999," seen anything on it or, you know, I think this game has sort of gotten that like,"
807.8199999999999,810.02," yeah, just slows."
810.02,811.26," See, I want to come out now."
811.26,811.78, Right.
811.78,812.78, Maybe just been understanding.
812.78,813.26, Yeah.
813.26,814.62, That's not scoffing at it.
814.62,818.14, The biggest question I've always had is just because we've seen all of the
818.14,820.62, individual pieces and we've kind of been told what they are.
820.62,823.9," Like, this phase of the tribal phase is, you know, cellular phase."
823.9,827.3399999999999, But how it all works together is a game is still in ludes.
827.6600000000001,831.4200000000001," Well, what's interesting is that at this event, they didn't really answer that question."
831.4200000000001,832.4200000000001, Mm-hmm.
832.4200000000001,836.7800000000001," Like, they, in fact, had all the different stages divided up into separate stages."
836.7800000000001,840.4200000000001," Physically in the, at the Maxis bill."
840.4200000000001,844.86," Yeah, their numerous stages situated throughout their studio, where you'd move from one to another."
844.86,849.9," And the problem was, I thought, it's got to be, it's a difficult game in general"
849.9,852.0600000000001, to demonstrate this on what I think.
852.0600000000001,856.7800000000001," But given that sort of compartmentalizing, you know, approach that they took there,"
857.66,861.3399999999999," it just was a disservice to the game because you'd hop at one station all of a sudden,"
861.3399999999999,864.4599999999999," you're with like three other journalists, you know, you don't want to ask your best"
864.4599999999999,867.66," questions. You're saving those for when you got like one on one time with Will Wright and,"
867.66,870.6999999999999," you know, Lucy Bradshaw, who's, you know, executive producer on the game."
871.42,876.3," Um, when you sit down, you're not like seeing, you're seeing entirely different characters."
876.3,880.3," It's not like various iterations of the same game, where, you know, you see,"
880.3,884.78," someone create one creature on station one, move over and see the same creature, like, you know,"
885.74,889.42," um, and it's next phase and they're like, okay, pay attention. I'm going to make a few decisions here,"
889.42,893.3399999999999," and you can see the carry over on the next station you go to. There was none of that. It was just basically,"
893.3399999999999,899.18," you go into one, see something, move onto another and see something else. And the other problem was that,"
899.66,904.22," why don't know if it's a problem so much as, you know, indicative of what the game is,"
904.9399999999999,911.02," is every station's, you know, person was super interested in emphasizing the character,"
911.1,916.78," I mean, the creature creation, um, just all, just the content creation system of the game,"
916.78,921.34," you know, you make spaceships and buildings and cities and things like this. Um,"
922.06,926.06," so most of it, right? Well, set their, they were, they were in menus, adding parts to things."
926.06,930.14," Yeah, that's moving around and morphing on and, and it looks entirely fun and cool."
930.78,935.1," Right. And by some people, that is, it's what's the game, part of that. Right. Yeah."
936.0600000000001,943.02, That's true. And a lot of that they didn't spend a lot of time on its trail. I was able to get
943.02,949.4200000000001," stuff that was reassuring, but so, you know, kind of going now, chronologically rather than reverse order."
950.7,954.7," That was where I was at at first. After I had made the rounds from the first two stations,"
955.5,960.62," I was like, God, because I'd always been afraid that this game is going to end up like a monster"
960.7,964.78," mix up book, you know, where you have like three panels, right? And they're on each page,"
964.78,968.3," just another monster, but then you're able to flip the top of the center and the bottom pieces to"
968.3,973.74," get these stars, star-tripe combinations. And I was like, that's like super fun, but I wanted something"
973.74,979.58," else from it. And that, because I'm, I'm very into, you know, evolutionary biology, um, I mean,"
979.58,983.26," sociology, so many of the things that are even, theology, I mean, all these things that the game"
983.26,990.3," touches on in one form or another, or at least promised to touch on. Um, and I really want to see,"
990.4599999999999,994.4599999999999," you know, when I go into it, I want to, I'm far more interested in say, like, what had, when there's a"
994.4599999999999,999.5," rival tribe, it's the same species as yourself, and they're saying, well, what you need to do is basically"
999.5,1003.02," unite all of your tribes into a proper civilization, so that you're, you know, moving from a"
1003.02,1007.9799999999999," tribal state to a civilization state. And they're like, you can do this by fighting them, or by"
1009.02,1014.2199999999999," sort of befriending them. And then when there's like a button that pops up on the screen, and it's like"
1014.2199999999999,1018.9399999999999," press A to fight, or press B to give them a present, then you know, I was able to ask,"
1018.94,1022.22," well, what happens? Can, can you go over there and watch them and steady see what their food"
1022.22,1026.8600000000001," source is? Can I destroy their food source? And then will they starve? And they would be like, oh, yeah,"
1026.8600000000001,1032.54," you can. Um, can I go over there and sort of create this equivalent of a selection pressure on,"
1032.54,1037.1000000000001," on their society by, off by playing them with gifts and musical performances and things?"
1037.1000000000001,1042.14," And then get their guard down so that their culture stops developing, you know, spears and,"
1042.14,1046.78," and warfare, you know, weapons to, to which warfare with, and then pull out my guns,"
1046.78,1051.5," to Trojan Horus scenario, right? And they're like, you know, yeah, I'm pretty sure you could do that,"
1051.5,1055.8999999999999," too, or like, depending on the question I asked someone had already tried it, or you could, and that"
1055.8999999999999,1061.34, was super fascinating to me. That's what makes the character customization worthwhile. Right.
1061.34,1065.34," But basically, like, practically, it seemed every question we asked them and will could,"
1065.34,1071.82," would this work? It was almost always yes, no matter what it was. In terms of how your species would"
1071.8999999999999,1077.8999999999999," evolve, how would evolve, evolve versus other species that were in the world, and even what would"
1077.8999999999999,1085.5, happen to your species and other people's games? Or there was even the notion of what happens when
1085.5,1092.62, you're one of your species gets abducted. Right. Let's back it up for us to explain how the game works
1092.62,1097.02," now because they added some, they filled in some of the blanks on how it works with other people."
1097.02,1101.5, So it's like a multiplayer game that you've never directly interact with other players with
1101.8999999999999,1105.8999999999999," we've known that, but here's an example of how massive are these single players, how they,"
1106.62,1113.82," that's the buzzword they use. And the way that works is by you create a bunch of content,"
1113.82,1117.4199999999998," you're able to send it to a friend or whatever, or they're able to search for it. They're able"
1117.4199999999998,1121.8999999999999," to subscribe to your content. Like a YouTube is the model here, and YouTube's going to come into"
1121.8999999999999,1126.86," play, and I'll talk about that in a minute. But so say you create a whole bunch of stuff, and people"
1126.86,1131.1," are like, oh, this guy did some really cool things in the past. Maybe he made, and it, you know,"
1131.1799999999998,1137.8999999999999, an entire beast-yery that is composed of creatures that are the shapes of the alphabet. So there's
1137.8999999999999,1141.5," an A creature, a B creature, and so on and so forth. People really like that, and they might want to"
1141.5,1145.74," subscribe to the content. And they could download that entire creature set as one thing, or maybe"
1145.74,1149.74," you're like entirely sprung on the Beatles, Yellow Summarine, and you're making like blue,"
1149.74,1153.34," meanies, and Yellow Summarines, and all this stuff. You could port that over to there."
1154.2199999999998,1157.8999999999999," You know, you can import it from someone else. If they make it, and they can tag it,"
1157.98,1161.8200000000002," you could search for these things, just like you didn't like a YouTube. You put whatever titles you"
1161.8200000000002,1167.98, want on there. So you see it been podcasting as another analogy. And if they call it a course for
1167.98,1174.46," cast. So like if you know that Sean Maloy is a great sport content maker, you just subscribe to"
1174.46,1180.0600000000002," Sean Maloy, and every time you create something, it would just automatically get uploaded to my machine."
1180.0600000000002,1184.0600000000002, Why is it a good player game? I don't want to do that. Okay. But for example. And that's the
1184.1399999999999,1188.3," other fun thing in the game. Because rather than like the game is not, so you know,"
1189.26,1193.58, the lover biology and things like that in me is disappointed to find out that the game is not
1193.58,1197.1799999999998," interested in natural selection at all. I mean, it's it's clearly an intelligent design"
1197.1799999999998,1201.6599999999999," sim, right? Where you have people just creating things however they want. There's no repercussions."
1201.6599999999999,1206.06," Like, I want to have fins on my back feeding. I hope some of my front one. It's not like the"
1206.06,1209.6599999999999, world and selection pressures are going to punish me for making the stupid monster. And that's why I
1209.66,1214.8600000000001," said the monster makes up book. You know, but I thought that you're you're a creature can fail in the"
1214.8600000000001,1219.02, you can. I'll get that in two minutes. I believe fish to start though because what what it is with the
1220.8600000000001,1225.74, with the sport cast and the content and the cross pollination there is like aesthetic or like
1225.74,1232.7, ideational uh pre selection. So survival of you know the hippest in the sense. So you can then track and see
1233.74,1238.7, what if this creature you may turn out to be the most popular among all sport users. There's like
1238.78,1243.1000000000001," multiple millions of copies of this thing gone around. That's like another wave saying like, oh,"
1243.1000000000001,1248.46," I mean, so what what it would it constitutes like a fit design as far as coolness, you know, it's like"
1248.46,1253.82, poke him on like the guy that made the poke him on the all the kids loved and latched onto and wrote
1253.82,1260.54, fanfick about having sex with. So wait for you to snap out. There probably will be some sport.
1261.5800000000002,1268.06, So the players are like a pantheon of gods vying for for the favor of other players. I don't understand
1268.1399999999999,1273.74," how how do you find out what happens is when you imp okay, so finish it. Well, this is an unrelated"
1273.74,1280.06," question, but part two, how how do you know how does a tag in the game that you are seeing someone"
1280.06,1285.02," else is monster walking around or is it completely transparent? No, I'm sure you what you do is"
1285.02,1288.78," you'd probably click on the creature and then pull up the like some information. Yeah, you know,"
1288.78,1293.58, if I say some of it is I would imagine in the game well the self it'll be transparent. You'll
1293.58,1297.5," just see these creatures going around and they're going to be from other people's games. And yeah,"
1297.58,1301.74," you probably won't know until you're clicking. I may have that wrong, but that's how I was right."
1301.74,1307.34," You can definitely do and if you want to go rod dog, which is slang expression first,"
1307.34,1313.18," sex without a condom, that's like you open off your ports in the game and you just let it all"
1313.18,1317.74, content for anyone. But it's like it's you know the worst thing that's going to be built right
1317.74,1324.14," is that term to. All right, it's like if you want to go rod dog, don't worry. You'll see a creature"
1324.22,1328.5400000000002, that looks like a boner. I'm going to try to carve this shape like a boner and it's planned.
1328.5400000000002,1333.5800000000002," It will be a giant set of things. No, but that's how you're going to get plenty of that. Yeah,"
1334.46,1338.22, that's about as bad as it's going to get. They actually in fact they actually talked about that.
1338.22,1343.42," They thought Lucy Bradshaw, the executive producer, talked about you know being a mom and being"
1343.42,1347.9," executive producer of this game, you know, of a gaming which other people's content was going to"
1347.9,1352.14, come into your game and they are going to totally have filters to prevent that kind of stuff from
1352.14,1355.74," happening. So you're not going to see like a swastika creature running around. Well,"
1355.74,1360.3000000000002, how's it going to filter it? Is it some guy you filter and you say I'm not going to accept content
1360.3000000000002,1364.8600000000001," other than from a proved people. Right. It's like a friend of not going to accept any. All right,"
1364.8600000000001,1369.26," it's not like smartly deciding that this thing looks like a penis. No, not going to let it in."
1369.8200000000002,1373.18," No, it's not doing that. It's more like your aim list or something. Yeah, okay. Yeah,"
1373.18,1377.74, it makes sense. The other thing though is they were it was funny to hear Jeff and Lucy talk about this
1377.82,1382.6200000000001," because both of you guys are parents and so you're like, oh yeah, your whole concern was what you"
1382.6200000000001,1388.06," don't want to come into your game. Well, of course, the grief for me is like, what can I put it"
1388.06,1395.58," and I create? But it was also the fun of like, and I didn't get a chance to ask them. We"
1395.58,1402.7," had limited time, but about modding opportunities where you can have greater freedom to control"
1402.7,1407.42," the variables and the characteristics of your creature, not just their superficial appearance,"
1407.5,1411.3400000000001," but their attributes, like reproduction rates and stuff so that you can make the equivalent of a"
1411.3400000000001,1417.1000000000001, triple or something in some like high-to-set of a mod where you create these creatures that go in and
1417.1000000000001,1421.74, just multiply like rabbits and just get out of hand or breaks them. Or things that like maybe
1421.74,1426.22," maybe that they seem entirely inert and they're just there and they're fine. But after like,"
1426.22,1431.8200000000002," you know, 30 generations, then they evolve into something that just becomes like absolutely catastrophic"
1431.8200000000002,1436.54," for whatever the plan it is or something like that. But fun things, you know, I mean,"
1436.62,1441.26," like that. Yeah, yeah. So what's real fun? What kind of stats do your creatures have? You're talking"
1441.26,1445.8999999999999," like reproduction rate or whatever. They don't control that, but you have, you could like look at them,"
1445.8999999999999,1451.18," though. You determine, I mean, when you put on, say, for example, when you're coming out of the"
1451.18,1456.3," the primordial pool and you decide that you're going to have talents as opposed to web feed,"
1456.3,1460.78," that will start pushing you along a path where you're going to be a carnivore or something,"
1460.78,1464.06," right? You're going to want to do something with those talents, same thing with like, if you have"
1464.06,1469.02," like a duck bill for sifting mock or if you have, you know, like an eagle's bill,"
1469.02,1474.06," eagle's beak. And that's going to determine if you're like in your early stages,"
1474.06,1477.98, if you're going to be a creature that sort of just gets by with the equivalent of diplomacy
1477.98,1482.78," and stuff, making other creatures happy or, you know, if you're simply putting an"
1482.78,1488.22, herbivore in your eaten plants and stuff or if you're eaten other creatures. But nothing
1488.22,1492.3799999999999," so extreme, though, where it's like, I mean, now here's what you said, there are fail conditions"
1493.3400000000001,1497.8200000000002, you have to have eyes at some point. That would be an example and it's going to make you get them.
1497.8200000000002,1501.8200000000002," And if you go in it, I think it'll let you go in, but then you'll see that your creature can't do anything"
1501.8200000000002,1507.5800000000002," and then it's like that's your way of saying, we'll back it up and develop back a location."
1507.5800000000002,1512.22," No, it's not like that. I wish it was. We're like, go live in a cave."
1512.22,1515.42," Is it like a blind cave creature? Yeah, it isn't kind of like that. They will like,"
1515.42,1519.98," kind of set you back, won't they? That's what? Yeah, you can, I mean, that was interesting, you know,"
1520.06,1524.38," you can, that you can die that you can fail, not because because after a while, you don't control"
1524.38,1529.42," just want a creature, but entire populations. Right. And so you can get to these, the fact that you can"
1529.42,1536.38," get to a fail state was surprisingly me because because the game's so flexible, it'd be fairly,"
1536.38,1540.3, it seems like it'll be fairly easy and actually will write confirmed that it is fairly easy to
1540.3,1547.42," create these scenarios where it's impossible to proceed or you just, some creature comes into play and"
1547.42,1551.98, you just can't deal it or you made the wrong decisions and it's like you're just absolutely
1552.54,1557.66," unprepared to handle whatever, you know, turn of events. So what will happen is the pull you back"
1557.66,1561.5," to the very beginning of that phase and there's five phases in the game, you know, there's like the"
1562.14,1566.94," cellular state, the primitive, you know, animal creature, creature game, then there's a tribe game,"
1566.94,1571.26," the civilization game, and then the space game. And they'll just bump you back to the beginning of that."
1571.26,1575.9," And that's not a really unreasonable thing to do. I mean, there's certainly a whole legacy"
1575.9,1582.38," of strategy games, even Sims games where your city might evolve to a place where you just fucked up."
1582.38,1588.38," Right. You know, your town layout or whatever, you've got yourself into a place or maybe the"
1588.38,1594.5400000000002," way you manage the economy, you've just hit a dead end. So I didn't feel like having a, you know,"
1594.5400000000002,1600.7, a fail state and sport be anything but kind of logical. So at what point so you're allowed to go in
1600.7,1604.46, and basically play God is just of the transitional things where you attach the eyes and stuff
1604.46,1609.74," or can at any point you and reach your hand in in the middle of the tribal phase for an example and say,"
1609.74,1613.58," oh, they're not doing very well without this limb. So I'm going to, I think in our mind,"
1613.58,1619.26," at any point in the in the game as far as I understood it, you can alter them and manipulate them."
1619.26,1623.3400000000001, And that's because you get evolution points or you get social points or things depending on the phase
1623.3400000000001,1626.7," you're playing. So that could be a way to get out of it. Like, say it's like I have enough social"
1626.7,1630.8600000000001," points on going to buy clubs, spike clubs for my creatures. And that would be another,"
1630.86,1635.58, couldn't like armor and stuff will have different roles. Like a ceremonial head dress might make you
1636.1399999999999,1640.3799999999999, that much more likely or to please a rival tribe when you go into a dance form and you have some
1640.3799999999999,1645.74," instruments and backup instruments for your for your other guys or if you have, you know, armor and"
1645.74,1651.58," stuff on that. So it looks cool, but it also does have some, you know, there's like it has some properties"
1651.58,1657.1, that will affect the game. No way. Okay. Playing. Is the entire game like a sandbox situation?
1657.4199999999998,1662.54," Not entirely. I mean, in fact, that's one of the cool things that I learned from that day that I thought"
1662.54,1666.9399999999998, was really neat was that they've they've definitely planted some stuff out there in the galaxy.
1666.9399999999998,1671.74," You know, the galaxies huge. There's a like, I don't even know how you would possibly visit it all,"
1671.74,1675.4199999999998, but they've they've definitely put stuff that's going to be in everybody's game that they're hoping
1675.4199999999998,1682.78," people will find. But there are achievements, Jeff. I would be surprised if there aren't. Yeah,"
1682.94,1687.98," the game. That's what I would say. But we don't know because they're so like determined to chase,"
1687.98,1694.3," you know, as wide of an audience as possible, the sandbox game does it's rather not is this just"
1694.3,1699.34," the sandbox game, but what do you need to do to make it the sandbox game that you want it to be?"
1699.34,1705.42, Because there's a very straightforward game there for like just someone who heard from a friend on
1705.42,1710.1399999999999, on aim that she should go to Walmart and pick this game up or something. That will walk you through
1710.22,1714.6200000000001," every step of the way. It's like you need to go and collect, you know, you need to go and eat five"
1714.6200000000001,1720.5400000000002, of these carnazers. You need to go and make this tribe happy. And then like that's when it comes
1720.5400000000002,1723.42, into play where I said you can go over there and press the button to make your guys attack or you can
1723.42,1726.94, go over there and press the button to do a dance or something. But it's actually going to have the whole
1726.94,1731.5, every stage of the game unlocked from the very beginning. So you don't even have you get to start
1731.5,1735.66," in the space age if you want. Yeah. They're not making a play at one year. Well, so you just can"
1735.74,1741.98," randomly seed an entire universe for you. If you guys want it, we'll do. Yes. And it does that."
1741.98,1746.38," It does that. I mean, it kind of does it intelligently, right? It's not going to in order to prevent"
1746.38,1750.8600000000001," these, you know, these catastrophic game states. It's going to know not to throw in something that's"
1750.8600000000001,1755.3400000000001," so hard that you can't deal with it. Likewise, when you're importing content from other people,"
1755.3400000000001,1759.8200000000002," it's not going to take someone's like insane monster. And you know, I keep talking about"
1759.8200000000002,1763.8200000000002, dinosaurs because there is a feature in the game. It's called epic sizing. You can actually take
1763.82,1768.54, whatever creatures you create and make just this grand version of it. So it knows it's not going to
1768.54,1773.5," throw you up against those kind of odds. And it's actually like a really, I mean, they're very clearly"
1773.5,1779.4199999999998, concerned about the difficulty curve and keeping everyone playing and enjoying it. And then it does
1779.4199999999998,1783.1799999999998," ratchet up to the point that there's like, you know, another surprise about the games. It's got an end"
1783.1799999999998,1788.78," game. You can beat the game. And what happens is as you get to your, you get off your planet."
1788.78,1793.26," You start exploring stars in your local solar system. I mean, planets in your solar system."
1793.34,1797.58," Then you'll go to other stars and other solar systems. And ultimately, you see your spiral"
1797.58,1802.46," galaxy. And you want to work your way across its arms toward the center, the nebula, the center,"
1802.46,1810.06, the galaxy. And around its perimeter is like a highly advanced species. It didn't say what exactly
1810.06,1814.54," they do. But whether if you take a diplomatic course with them, they're going to be like very"
1814.54,1817.18," tough to bargain with. You know, they're going to take a lot of work that way. And if you're going"
1817.18,1820.86," to fight them, they're going to take a lot of work that way. You get past them and then there's some"
1820.9399999999998,1827.6599999999999," big surprise awaits. We'll very casually said. And I think, you know, we surprising in"
1827.6599999999999,1833.1," you'll like it. You could tell, but me the the composer that he seemed pretty proud of it. I don't"
1833.1,1836.9399999999998," know, did you, I took that. Oh, definitely. Yeah. They would have worked up some kind of like epic"
1836.9399999999998,1842.4599999999998," boss and game thing. Oh, are we? That's what you're right. You took from it. Well, I mean, at least"
1842.4599999999998,1847.02," not maybe the very last surprise, but definitely that race you're talking about this center there."
1847.1,1851.9," But what about the very, very center? Who knows what the hell that's going to be? I mean,"
1851.9,1855.5," I figured they'll want to do something. Right. Floating head. Yeah, it's going to be wheelset."
1855.5,1860.86," Maybe with a wall cat. Well, I know knowing will in his interests, you know,"
1860.86,1865.42, and the reading he doesn't cause malagene stuff. My guess is like it's either going to be some
1865.42,1871.98," play on, you know, a universal contraction expands and constantly recreates itself, right? So,"
1871.98,1876.62," you know, the serial big bang sort of theory or the parallel multiple, the multiverse type thing,"
1876.6999999999998,1881.02," where you find out that there, there's, there's something else, you know, that you can do."
1881.58,1888.06," So we get to a six stage, the multiverse. Oh, God. I make the green lantern."
1889.1,1891.9799999999998," You know, you probably can't do it. Oh, we know it Ryan's going to do."
1892.62,1897.34," Look at green lantern, spaceship. Can you create black holes? I'm brought out the sun. No."
1899.1,1905.58," But you can't, but you can't eradicate. You can do planets, though. Oh, I really. Yes, you can."
1905.6599999999999,1910.9399999999998, Just erase a pretty good white outside of the entire planets. The Death Star type series. Nice.
1912.06,1915.98," Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can. Yeah, and you'll be able to track it. You can't look like it does."
1915.98,1920.46," How, how well did your race do it in other other people's games, too. So they'll have also to"
1920.46,1926.6999999999998," track and things. So, you know, this whole, the whole notion of, you know, did you make a survival race?"
1926.6999999999998,1930.54," And yeah, it did not just be in your own game. Did people want to kill it or did they want to"
1930.54,1936.22," befriend it? That's the other thing about the interaction that, like, their certain scenarios that"
1938.46,1942.54," that most people will probably encounter in one form or another, that are cool. And that will be like where,"
1943.34,1948.22," say you're in your, your tribal state, there might be like a UFO or something, a little visit."
1948.22,1953.1," And at that point, it's kind of foreshadowing what's to come. Maybe later on, you might actually"
1953.1,1959.02," run into that same, to that same species or whatever it was, it visited your planet."
1959.74,1963.74," Or if it's in a friends game, maybe maybe the UFO was one of your friends or something."
1963.74,1968.3799999999999," The, the really cool scenario where things like, we're interesting to me is when, you know, I asked"
1968.3799999999999,1972.7," if, if it's possible to have the kind of scenario where, you know, you're playing the game,"
1972.7,1977.82," you're the creature phase, and you start sending out your, your creations to friends or whatever"
1977.82,1984.86," anyone on the internet, they go out and then you continue to play. And then, as you're re-importing,"
1985.02,1989.82," you know, other people's stuff, you end up getting, you end up either inadvertently pulling back"
1989.82,1993.8999999999999," that very creature that you had in the creature stage, but maybe with some various modifications,"
1993.8999999999999,1997.4199999999998," people might have made to it and it ends up on some other planet. So then when you leave, you know,"
1997.4199999999998,2002.3799999999999," your, your planetary cradle and you're out exploring the universe, you kind of like find your own ancestors"
2002.3799999999999,2007.26," on another planet. So I mean, this is, that's the kind of stuff I think that, and they said, they said,"
2007.26,2011.74," yes to that, they said that could. They said that, yeah, that definitely can't happen. Right. So you,"
2011.82,2016.06," yeah, so you might, you're playing your own game and you'll fly off to some distant star and see"
2016.06,2022.22, like your dude evolved in a completely different way. And that could happen even if you don't import
2022.22,2027.9," from your, from somebody else's game, right? Yeah, because you could get abducted by an NPC alien"
2027.9,2033.42," early on in the, in the creature game and then fly off many, many, many years later and find that"
2033.42,2037.34," that creature had evolved. Yeah, he's, he's worshiped as a god somewhere else. You know,"
2037.82,2043.6599999999999," it sounds cool. So all that has got me like really excited about it. I mean, it's taken some time."
2043.6599999999999,2049.34," And you know, to be fair, like, we'll write has made like sim-life and stuff. They've made games that"
2049.34,2056.14," are essentially natural selection sims. And the problem there, like again, you know, why, why they,"
2056.14,2061.8199999999997," they're not running with that here is because, I mean, it takes so many generations and it takes"
2061.8199999999997,2066.38," such enormous populations to approach anything like real natural selection. You know, we're"
2066.46,2071.42," going to have to have like 300 generations and a population that's at least like 20,000 or something."
2072.1400000000003,2076.2200000000003," And then it becomes such an abstraction to the player that they don't feel that immediate,"
2076.2200000000003,2079.9," like, connection that they want in this game is about connecting to these like, cucumbers."
2080.94,2084.94," Right. But, but again, the reason why the other is interesting to me is because"
2085.7400000000002,2090.7000000000003," it's the possibility you're basically talking about a game that would surprise you in ways that,"
2090.7000000000003,2093.6600000000003," like, instead of this cute stuff like, oh, what if I ran into myself? I mean,"
2094.3799999999997,2099.1," you could just do the same things. You know, you would basically, you could just have your own species"
2099.1,2104.7," divide into two tribes. Sit one of them across a river and then basically trigger some sort of,"
2104.7,2110.06," like, an eruption or or a continental activity. I mean, I'll play the iconic activity, bring up a"
2110.06,2114.06, mountain range and separate them. And then you'd have them speciate along different lines where you
2114.06,2119.1," start to, you put in different plants and different other animals to like, pressure them to do something"
2119.1,2122.06," else. And then you kind of just see what happens, how they diverge. You know, basically, like,"
2122.14,2127.74," watching evolution, you know, happen on the screen before you and see. Or instead of like,"
2127.74,2133.98," and then it makes you think, instead of like, hey, I just, I know I got to get 15 evolution points to"
2133.98,2137.82," get to the next level. Then you have to think, well, are there, what are our evolutionary"
2137.82,2142.2999999999997, dead ends? What are mutations that are like not going to work and which ones are working?
2142.2999999999997,2147.18," So obvious ones, you'd like, hey, we know that like, you know, fingers and claws are going to work,"
2147.18,2151.1, but what if I tried something really odd with that work? And then if you find the game find some
2151.18,2156.2999999999997," weight and it actually does work, you know, that game will be around modern. It's my,"
2156.2999999999997,2161.66," you know, the, I'm actually, it's really, it's really fascinating and it's just sort of boggles my"
2161.66,2167.02," mind that there's this kind of a little bit of nacing going on. I mean, you know, at this point,"
2168.2999999999997,2171.74, I feel like will write this kind of earned a little bit of a better than the doubt.
2172.46,2176.38," After, you know, years of making like fucking amazing games, you know,"
2176.7000000000003,2184.1400000000003," right. Oh, I think there's some, some element of it might be just the fact that no matter how rich"
2184.1400000000003,2190.3," the simulation and Sims was, or Sims 2, it kind of is known now as the dress-up doll game."
2191.26,2195.42," Like, you, you look in the shelf and you see like the, you know, H&M style packs and I was like,"
2195.42,2199.6600000000003," kind of just throwing in the towel at that point saying, right. Well, that was that, you know,"
2199.6600000000003,2205.82," that, that in particular is a case of the franchise. It's so far beyond what it originally was,"
2206.06,2210.2200000000003," you know, and, and they're catering to a specific demographic with the stuff like the H&M."
2210.2200000000003,2215.02," Of course. I don't want to be an apologies for the Sims here, but, you know, that started out as a pretty"
2215.02,2220.94," hardcore strategy game, actually, you know, originally. Right. There is a really detailed simulation"
2220.94,2225.98, going on under there. And I think part of maybe this backlash from the sport might just be associating
2227.26,2232.06," the other stuff, you know, they, you know, dress up your space dolly. Well, it's a different way there."
2232.06,2236.62," They're definitely going for both. It's like, they have both volumes. Yeah. They are,"
2236.62,2240.7," it's like huge success in the Sims. What the question is the question for me, as long as like,"
2240.7,2244.06, because it will be ideal if you hit them both up. You have a game where you have just all this
2244.06,2249.82," creative freedom, but then you also have like this game and this like a sandbox that's complex enough"
2249.82,2255.2599999999998," and that's surprising enough and that outcomes, situations that that arise from it, that I'll be entertained"
2255.2599999999998,2260.06," on both levels. But, but, yeah, I mean, it is a real thing. It's, it's a real concern because,"
2260.38,2266.06," they found out with a lot of their games, Max has found out that people had more fun just dressing up"
2266.06,2270.54," the dolls or even if it's like SimCity, just making buildings and stuff, not worrying about whether"
2270.54,2274.38," or not the buildings actually made sense in the city or anything, but if they just look cool,"
2274.38,2278.62," how tall they were and things like that. That, and you know, I don't want to knock that at all."
2278.62,2282.62," It's totally, that's totally fun stuff to do. But then the fear would be that they say,"
2282.62,2288.7799999999997, this is what people really want. So we need to make this our number one sort of priority in
2288.78,2292.2200000000003, our design document and then we'll worry about the other stuff later and then you have a like
2292.2200000000003,2296.6200000000003," a relatively rudimentary game that doesn't deliver on any of the promise. But I honestly,"
2297.7400000000002,2303.1800000000003," I'm pretty excited for it now. I don't, by the end of, end of that visit, I was cool."
2303.1800000000003,2308.1400000000003, Did they say when they're coming out? I feel reassured now. They were very far along.
2308.1400000000003,2312.3," They didn't give us a date on when it's coming out, but it was, it was far along. It did."
2312.3,2317.5," This year. I don't even know. Yeah, it was definitely it's this year, but we have no idea what they"
2317.5,2322.54, talked about that like card game or whatever again since that he three a couple years ago.
2323.58,2327.18, That even come up during it. It hasn't come up. So I don't know if they've moved on from that.
2327.18,2331.66," I don't know if the sport PDA, which is the name that they've given for this whole, you know,"
2333.5,2339.18, the whole sport casting mechanism. I don't know if that's replaced the card mechanism.
2340.06,2345.74," Yeah, the card idea was that your, basically it was like trading cards, right, for, for"
2345.8199999999997,2349.02, everybody's creatures like you with your creature would have a card.
2349.02,2353.1, A Pokemon card. Basically like a Pokemon card. Where do you could monitor it? Stats.
2353.1,2356.14, I don't know if they've lost that model. It doesn't click it. I think it's still there.
2356.14,2359.74," They're just might still be virtual cards. Okay. Yeah, it's their, their stephead."
2359.74,2365.2599999999998," Two last things about it before we go on to something else is that the, the YouTube connection."
2365.2599999999998,2369.02, Right. You can record videos in the game while you're playing or whatever you're doing.
2369.02,2373.3399999999997, And then just click a button and put someone in YouTube. So you don't have to go to an EAP page or
2373.34,2377.1000000000004," okay, yeah, they're basically built and they made a deal with YouTube. So there's a button"
2377.1000000000004,2380.94, right in the interface to go straight to YouTube. That's pretty awesome. Yeah.
2380.94,2385.9," It's just a meeting like if they had the EA video page, people are just going to like take it out"
2385.9,2390.38," and put it on YouTube. But anyway, so people will see it. So it's like why waste any one's time."
2390.38,2394.94," Same thing with like the reasoning for letting you jump in. If you're inclined, jump into any phase"
2394.94,2398.6200000000003, of the game you want and play. It's like you've paid money for the game. You do what you want.
2398.94,2403.8199999999997," And hey, you can't, you can't shit on that. I mean, if you want to play the game the, the right way,"
2403.8199999999997,2407.9, which is the interesting way to me because then you can look for continuity as you develop over the
2407.9,2413.66," the course of your your species lifemen or if you want to do the other thing, that's like you."
2413.66,2417.3399999999997," It just because other, it shouldn't upset you if you're playing it the right way to know"
2417.3399999999997,2424.7799999999997," that other people are just doing whatever, you know. And then the other thing is that they have the 3D printer"
2424.86,2430.6200000000003," in their own office and they've been making these really cool, um, basically 3D painted models"
2430.6200000000003,2436.78, of the creatures that they've been making. But they're at least looking into kind of service where
2436.78,2439.98, you can order one of your own creatures. Like the world of workcraft. Like the world of workcraft.
2439.98,2444.2200000000003," Of course, we know that's like prohibitively expensive. They're 100 dollars for your world of workcraft"
2444.2200000000003,2447.9," character. But hey, they're really cool. And if you like your sport, then and maybe you're proud."
2447.9,2453.7400000000002," You reach like the the million down, I mean, you know, downloads, swapmark. You want to"
2453.74,2463.18," celebrate with a little trophy. You can buy it for $100. So wait. That's that. Sorry,"
2463.18,2467.58, I almost belched to the mic there. It's wonderful that that face wasn't like the end of
2467.58,2475.66," these sports. Yeah, no, I'm okay. So uh, but it's been a little from series to a quick sideline"
2475.66,2480.4599999999996," and Anthony, you want to, we'll talk about our new series of names for our series of A-Leases"
2481.1,2487.9," for what is on the bat? Well, Anthony played, I play a company here. There's pretty much every"
2487.9,2491.98," online PC game with Anthony and you heard me talk about Rory and said, the guys met in James."
2492.7,2498.7, And we'd like to come up with like names that say we're a group. Not only do you
2498.7,2504.2200000000003," cook, of names to say you group, but when it comes to like naming a particular match of co,"
2504.2200000000003,2508.7, you guys have all these different strategies to get people to come in. The current favorite is a
2508.8599999999997,2515.2599999999998," 44 Ron Paulicost. That's a good one. That one tends to incite the people or there was,"
2515.2599999999998,2522.7799999999997, they come in and their names like Ron Paul. Exactly. The Gromple rules. You mean you set up that
2522.7799999999997,2526.54," name and that attracts people? Yeah, because we're always trying to figure out what will get"
2526.54,2532.3799999999997, people to come in fastest. And it's already that it was for a while they figured out using like
2532.38,2539.98, current movies. So like 44 Transformers. I can play and we can chat about Transformers.
2539.98,2544.1400000000003," You're right. The worst that was when they let Sean name the game, so on a regular basis,"
2544.1400000000003,2551.1," Sean starts making like horrible, horrible, sleazy names for it. Like, like,"
2551.1,2556.38," chili dog, chili dog was the worst shit. I didn't think you're going to say that dude."
2557.34,2562.38," I got to explain it. Well, you did. Or do I want you to do the chili dogs not even fit for"
2562.38,2567.82," you. Oh my god, really? That must be bad. I'm already getting in a bad image. I don't want to hear"
2567.82,2572.86, this. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably not what you think. The chili is what you think. The dog is what you think.
2572.86,2577.42," But the bun's not what you think. Okay. Well, the chili and thinking about the bun,"
2578.78,2584.54," just telling me in the dog and a lawn or a lot. All right, to paint a bad visual. But I got like,"
2585.2599999999998,2590.7799999999997," well, I got to change it now because the pictures of this on our boards. My name is my name."
2590.7799999999997,2598.22, My name is using essential sharding. But that kid does it off. She can's
2599.1,2606.38," very found this picture of like, an obese, like a morbidly obese woman in lingerie"
2607.58,2613.18, from a website called Gorgeous and Gorgeous. And she's just like devouring.
2613.2599999999998,2620.46," Don't want to touch. She's just covered in like, you know, jelly donuts and like cream puffs and stuff."
2622.7799999999997,2630.06," Yeah, good luck. We had a good laugh over that and decided that that was our new theme."
2631.1,2635.74," Gorgeously what and gorging. Yeah, that's a good word. So that's all. That's all."
2635.74,2639.5, Our name gorgeous and gorging. Now he's feasting and facon.
2639.98,2648.78, So that's the thing. So like what what are some other ones? You're wapo-y gorda. Good looking in fat.
2648.78,2652.78," It's nice. What other we had like,"
2654.22,2658.54, did you guys jump? We just sat there like making like tons of them to give to everyone
2659.74,2664.94, for a siding team names. I don't know if I could play with you. But that's just beneath me.
2665.82,2668.7," Well, that and we always wonder if everyone can tell where a team we're like, we have to make it"
2668.7,2672.3799999999997, so we don't look like a team. But we look like a team when we're guarding.
2676.54,2678.22, You're taking it the next step with the sharding one.
2683.8999999999996,2688.7799999999997, So that's it. Or there was another game that drew a lot of people and was four
2688.7799999999997,2694.14," before big beautiful women. Like, that was a weird woman. Yeah, just like because they think they're"
2694.22,2698.22," like playing hot chicks. W-O-M-Y-N. Then you ask, are you, are you,"
2698.22,2703.2599999999998," well, mine when they come in and then or like when we when we have different names and people can't"
2703.2599999999998,2708.06, tell one person goes on the other team and then while you're chatting because the thing is an
2708.06,2714.06, RTS is it's it's a pain in the ass to get people to join your game to play. You sit there and wait
2714.06,2717.58, and wait for people to like come in and you get enough people to fill the game and then you start to
2717.58,2722.2999999999997, so as you're sitting there anytime someone comes in you don't want them to leave. So you want to
2722.3,2726.54, talk to show them that you're there and you're ready to go when you fill up the game. So we'll say
2726.54,2733.34," things like, hey, like ASL and like, are you using your personal? Yeah, except like you"
2733.34,2737.1800000000003, try and keep them from getting scared of our stats so you start talking like the biggest retard.
2737.1800000000003,2743.34," Like, like sending stats like, hey, what what name is it? Start leaving out vowels and"
2744.3,2752.94," hi to all hi to all utterances. Oh, I haven't done that in a long time and I don't miss it. Like"
2752.94,2759.7400000000002, random pickup strategy games. I just have so many bad memories of that. This can be tough.
2759.7400000000002,2764.94," Most mostly if people logging off when the going gets tough, you know, like up you see your"
2764.94,2771.34, losing so you're at. So you're pretty good at strategy games. You kick some ass. I'm not saying
2771.42,2776.06," you can't. You kick ass so much that people have the log-offs to avoid being. No, I'm just saying,"
2776.06,2780.7000000000003," yet no, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying at the soon as sign of even any challenge,"
2780.7000000000003,2785.26, some people will just bail or they'll just bail for no reason at all or you get the guy you just
2785.26,2789.26, decides he's going to go get a sandwich in the middle of the game and say anything and you're just
2789.26,2794.86," like, on hello, hi, your turn. I mean, it's a turn. It's better that they do it when the game"
2794.86,2799.9, starts than like they wait in there for 30 minutes and then you finally get four people on the other
2799.9,2805.98," team and then one of them just leaves. Right. Like why did you do that? Well, we proceeded by got to go."
2806.54,2813.42," So, and then they're just out. That's great. Yeah, you always happen and take it to ride, which"
2813.42,2819.26," which is, I don't know if you guys know that but it's an awesome board game that got translated"
2819.26,2826.3," onto into a PC version recently, not recently a year or so ago and I used to play that all the time"
2826.78,2832.38, that's a game where there's like a lot of build up to aggression. So you're like build up your
2832.38,2839.42, rail road lines and it was sort of like a common understood like gentleman's agreement that you wouldn't
2840.38,2845.34," you wouldn't do something, you know, basically you're just trying to build your own lines. You have"
2845.34,2849.82, your own goals. Everybody has their own goals that they're working towards and at the end they're
2849.82,2854.1400000000003, sort of like a reckoning. I could did this the best and you can you can play it just sort of
2854.14,2858.8599999999997, benignely like I'm just going to build my railroad lines and see make sure that I win and come
2858.8599999999997,2864.3799999999997, up with the best way or you can like choose to fuck with the other guy. And it's kind of the gentleman's
2864.3799999999997,2868.7, thing online that you're not going to you're not really going to do that. It's a little bit of the
2868.7,2873.8199999999997, assult thing to do like block somebody's line. You could see okay they're trying to build a railroad line
2873.8199999999997,2879.9," from New York to to Miami. I see that they're doing that and if I put this, just play this thing"
2879.9,2885.82, right here it's going to fuck up their line. You could do it but usually you just don't. Or maybe
2885.82,2889.58," you would like at home in the board game if you're playing with your own family. But no, we're"
2889.58,2893.82, just decided upon for you to get in the game. But if we're going to have a little bit of a challenging
2893.82,2897.9, someone to do it. Right. But of course you can do it. It's part of the game. Right. I mean if you
2897.9,2902.86," want to win, you can do it. But what's what happens is if you choose to do it and you might do it"
2902.86,2907.7400000000002," because you just feel like winning or just because maybe you know that that player's an ass or something,"
2907.8199999999997,2912.7, you'll start getting yelled at in the chat. You know like fuck you. What are you playing the game
2912.7,2917.66, like this before? Of course that kind of makes you want to do it even more. But then the
2917.66,2924.3799999999997, interesting thing is that community evolved that way. Yeah. Do not use the game rules to win.
2924.3799999999997,2928.9399999999996, Yeah exactly. Which would always be people's argument back. Which was mine when I felt like doing it.
2928.9399999999996,2934.7," It was like, of course I can block. That's, you know, if I couldn't block the game when it let me"
2934.7799999999997,2938.9399999999996, block. Sorry. Well you get to a point where you just know where the people's are out. Sorry because
2938.9399999999996,2942.54," you know what. Right. No, you can see what they're trying to do. Well that's part of the strategy of the"
2942.54,2948.7799999999997, game is to build your route in a way that they can't really tell. Right. You go out of from opposite ends
2948.7799999999997,2953.8199999999997," or whatever you try to, you try to bluff people. Right. Sounds ridiculous. That's like a gentleman's game."
2954.9399999999996,2958.14," It is what you're saying. I'm like, okay. This is a game. It's about competitive railroad"
2958.14,2961.8999999999996, tycons. Right. Yep. And then you're not supposed to do anything. That's not even cut throw. You're
2961.9,2965.82," like, you're not supposed to do anything. It's slightly aggressive. Right. The line where do you draw"
2965.82,2971.42," the line? What does it? It's a strange way in the country. We'll make five, uh, it's not in a line."
2971.42,2976.46," Well it is a bit of a best men win. I mean, this is somewhere between like a casual game and a"
2976.46,2981.5," and a serious strategy game. So yeah, it depends on who you're playing with. Some people will,"
2981.5,2986.38," will, will all be into the competitiveness. And other people will get mad at you. Yeah, they'll do that."
2986.38,2989.9, Yeah. Even even even their their text chat sounds like that voice.
2990.38,2994.46," Well, you have to play that way. Settle is a katana. It kind of has a similar"
2995.34,2999.1800000000003, mechanic. I don't know if you played that right. I played that. Sure. You're building your roads out.
2999.1800000000003,3003.98, And it's really easy to build your road and just fuck someone over. So they can't go where they're
3003.98,3007.98, obviously trying to go. And some people I play with or that's how they want to play. And some people are
3007.98,3012.46," just like, I can't believe you did that. I'm quitting. I would, you know, right. They have the"
3012.46,3018.62," gentleman's understanding, even though you don't, you just, right. We're, yeah, I'll get it. It's like,"
3018.62,3025.74," no, this is part of the game. So when I play in the game that I, I bought, I'm not playing"
3025.74,3030.38, some imaginary version of that game. It's like Street Fighter when like they people's had
3030.38,3037.02, to throw. Yeah. Yeah. Or like no ringouts on SoulCowder. Yeah. I agree. Those are dumb. The
3037.02,3040.54, extreme end of things is. We're seeing it enough to be on the edge of the ring when you just
3040.54,3045.18," heard the end of the world. Well, it's kind of like people like, you know, complaining and yelling"
3045.18,3052.7799999999997," about dying on a PvP server in, wow. Yeah. You had the game, can you? Yes, because we're on a PvP server."
3053.3399999999997,3058.7," Therefore, I had to kill you. Sorry. I can push the limits of that though. Like when, you know,"
3058.7,3063.02," we'll see other people like, they find an exploit where you can build a century on under the map"
3063.02,3067.18," and team fortress two. And then people like, they're like, dude, it's in the game. I wouldn't be able"
3067.18,3073.66," to doubt if they didn't want me to do it. Okay. Okay. Explain why did that before? But actually,"
3074.14,3079.42," on the same side, it's not just gentleman's games like ticket to ride like a team fortress classic."
3080.46,3086.46," Anthony, did you play that much? Nope. They, there was sort of this like, de facto rule that would be"
3087.2599999999998,3092.3799999999997, you had to have an offense team and you had to have a defense team for each side. And when you're
3092.3799999999997,3099.42," crossing the bridge or the no man's land in the middle, you couldn't attack other offensive teams."
3099.5,3103.42," So if you're an offensive team going in and you're going to pass by their offensive team,"
3103.42,3108.3, you don't waste your time fighting each other. You just go and hit each other's defense.
3108.3,3111.5," And it seems so weird, right? You know, there's like their snipers in the game to shoot you when"
3111.5,3115.82," you're crossing that bridge. And so some would say, well, snipers defense of that's okay."
3115.82,3119.02," Others would say, no, you can't have snipers in the game. We don't want them in here because it"
3119.02,3122.38, ruins it. But it would be the same thing. You pop into a server and people start yelling at you
3122.38,3126.54, because you go out into the middle of the map. You start shooting the enemy. Turned sure enough turns out
3127.5,3132.7799999999997," some reason for it. In the old days of battlefield 1942, I would often"
3133.74,3139.34," high tail it over to the enemies base. And I wouldn't, wouldn't exactly be. I wouldn't"
3139.34,3143.66," call it spawn camping. He's camping is what it's called. But basically base camping. And it,"
3143.66,3150.7," but I felt the same way like like if you don't like it, then find me and kill me. But in the meantime,"
3150.7,3156.3, I'm going to get these frags. And that is definitely that was a decision on Dice's part to allow that.
3156.62,3161.18, Because all I have to do is they've already had the code for like no entries.
3161.18,3164.3," Ons, right? When you go outside the borders in the app, it gives you a warning. You have five seconds"
3164.3,3168.3, to get back to your job. All they have to do is code that base. Sure. No entry. Right. They could have
3168.3,3172.46," absolutely done that. Or yeah. And so it's like, hey, they didn't want to do it. And it's a fun way to"
3172.46,3178.94," get points, man. You take your help. Absolutely. Over there. Over there spawn. And the map's"
3178.94,3183.9, shark eye I can say because it was so fun. We get the helicopter and we called it anti-eating because
3183.9,3188.46, on the top of the building there's like a stairwell. And it's a spawn right in front of it and
3188.46,3194.14," inside of it. And we pushed it. We'd fly it. However, the helicopter so close to the building that the"
3194.14,3199.1, the gattling gun would go into the doorway. It would look like an anti-tutor's tongue going into the
3199.1,3202.7000000000003, ant hive. And then the ants would spawn in there. We just blow them up the second day appeared.
3203.34,3209.9, That's fun stuff. Something about sniping in games where it just feels so wrong and so
3209.9,3214.78, cheating unless you're the sniper and then it's like the most fun thing ever. I just remember
3214.78,3221.98," so many death matches in the old days of CGW where some other fucker, you know, be Dave Salator,"
3221.98,3228.54," the old tech editor or Joe Volina, the old managing editor. These guys were like expert snipers."
3228.54,3232.46, And they would find some spot. It would just take you forever to figure out where the fuck they were.
3232.46,3237.02, And they'd just be picking off one after another just cracking up the frack. And you just want to
3237.02,3243.34," kill them. But then if you would do it back, you know, Dave in particular, he was tech editors"
3243.34,3248.54," two before Darren when he left. This guy would get so angry if he would snip him. He would like,"
3249.66,3254.38, it was ironic because he was a tech editor. This dude broke more equipment in the office
3254.38,3260.38, from getting mad from being sniped. And yet he was like the king of all douchebags snipers.
3260.62,3270.06, Seven max dude. Seven max. It's here about seven max. Seven max. So three of season two.
3270.06,3275.02," Just reviewed it. Night of the raving dead, which um, okay, if we're posting this on February 13th,"
3275.02,3280.86, you should be able to get it. I think it on the website now on telltale's website. It's
3280.94,3287.34, Sam and Max meet some zombies. It's pretty cool. How would you rate it on these in terms of the
3287.34,3294.7000000000003," series as far as like just season two. The first episode, I stationed Santa was one of the best"
3294.7000000000003,3301.98," episodes in the whole series. I agree. And then the second episode, Moai Better Blues is probably the"
3301.98,3307.6600000000003, worst episode. That's the one that you just released funny. Go when you see the puzzles in that one.
3307.66,3313.98," But I thought it was at the most misses in the in the humor department. Yeah, it was three years"
3313.98,3319.42," short humor. Yeah. And in this one's sort of in the middle. So it's on year, but maybe the puzzle's"
3319.42,3326.46," on it is. I mean, the humor is a lot better. It's way funny. But uh, the puzzle's are just kind of annoying."
3327.5,3332.54," Can you do these standalone? I mean, yeah. Yeah. Like this with a zombie one and a matter. As of"
3332.54,3339.02," episode two, there was like very little problem in it. There's an arc that's coming together."
3339.02,3342.54," I mean, there's a couple of threads that have been kind of in a background. The first couple of"
3342.54,3348.3," so it's like, okay, we're going somewhere with these now. Okay. But the puzzles and this even"
3348.3,3352.7799999999997," with like the built-in hand system, it's like, what do they want me to do? It's like a couple of"
3353.5,3360.7799999999997, but those games have always kind of been that way. Not to this degree. Like this in the last episode.
3360.86,3365.34," To me, like you told me, you like the puzzles. I thought the puzzles and that one were perfect."
3365.34,3369.1800000000003," No, I bet if lose I thought they were kind of dumb. Like everything like clicked when I"
3369.1800000000003,3372.86," went at was supposed to. And like, you know, you have those little revelations in your head. Like this"
3372.86,3378.7000000000003," plus this, oh, and never got stumped and just did the random walking around and clicking on everything."
3379.6600000000003,3386.3," Which most games like that, I inevitably at one point have to do. Yes, the original Sam and Max"
3386.38,3392.38, hits the road. I have a memory of just taking every single thing in my inventory. Just randomly
3392.38,3396.78, clicking on binding it. That was just a bit. That is just a bit of a piece of Lucas art games. Yeah.
3397.42,3403.1800000000003, Yeah. So this is have because the trailer had that like 30 silent movie vibe to it.
3403.1800000000003,3406.78, Is that actually part of the episode two? Is that just a trailer gimmick?
3407.82,3414.54, I wouldn't say that this episode has that sort of vibe. It's like a goofy like
3415.34,3419.98," these like, well, look like disco raves on bees and because they look totally did a nose for"
3419.98,3424.62," a two like with a complete with no sound they would talk and then they put up a title card. Yeah,"
3424.62,3428.3, there's no that. That's a shame. I thought they were going to do something clever. You there are the you
3429.58,3435.5," that I hope this isn't a very big spoiler, but there are there's a zombie salmon Max. Oh great Ryan cheese."
3436.3,3444.3," That's not a big spoiler. Fuck. It's it's cool though. I like it. Yeah, I guess"
3444.3,3449.5800000000004, it would have been great if it had been spoiled by you. Dang. There's other stuff.
3450.86,3453.26, It's not a fixed plan. I'm God. I've done with you.
3454.54,3460.6200000000003, All right. There's anything else to say about salmon Max. I'm so three. Season two.
3460.6200000000003,3466.94, Once you're review it going to be online or at by the time you listen to this.
3466.94,3470.46, It's going to get a letter grade isn't it? Wow. You need to get a letter grade.
3470.78,3478.78," That's revolutionary. Holy crap. So salmon Max, it's nine episodes in and it's still."
3479.7400000000002,3485.42, They're still going to do a good one. Right on. All right. All right.
3485.98,3490.38, Shall we take a break? Stick a break. We'll take a break. We didn't take a break. We'll be back.
3492.14,3496.46, You were a member of a secondary 15 that is brought in to find more information regarding the
3496.46,3501.5, secret project at all in the channel. Expect the intensity of battle to continue in the second
3501.5,3507.58, expansion pack to the critically-adlaimed first person shooter fear. We're back.
3509.02,3513.98, I hope you enjoyed that advertisement and I recommend you buy five of whatever it was we just sold
3513.98,3519.98," them. You've only read the joke last time. Did I? No, the exact one. Five five copies and"
3519.98,3525.02, I did. Shit. You've been making that. I need to make a five material. Five months. I know.
3525.02,3528.7, I got like five this would happen when you get all you got like five jokes you just put them in
3528.7,3537.34, rotation to you die. So if you become Dane Cook or my dad or okay my dad just sent me an email yesterday
3537.34,3545.26, Sunday and the whole email said it said deer Jeff. I have an eaten in two weeks in case it was food in
3545.5800000000004,3553.0200000000004, my mouth when you called me. Because I have a talk to him in two weeks. I have an eaten in two weeks
3553.0200000000004,3557.7400000000002, in case it was food in my mouth when you called me. Basically saying calm call me because I Jewish guilt.
3560.3,3564.78, Like you could calm down for myself until you call me that's when you're saying that was his point.
3564.78,3572.86, I'll have a strange way for a leading. Anyway. As an entity here at guest to sweet. So as our guest
3573.7400000000002,3580.2200000000003, I like to know what do you plan? I don't know. I don't know.
3580.2200000000003,3586.06, I don't mean to treat you like you're a retard. He's talking about dad. He works for my teacher.
3586.06,3589.6600000000003, I'm a stranger. I'm a stranger. He's been on the fridge. He's not a dumb guy over the
3589.6600000000003,3600.38, teeth side. Actually I've just been playing a lot of ketchup ever since I built my new computer
3600.46,3604.94, because there's like a lot of games I'd never played. I'd never played through Half Life 2.
3606.3,3613.26, You've now beat Ryan. I don't play shooters. I don't play shooters. It doesn't matter.
3614.1400000000003,3619.7400000000002, But keep trying to tell him. And then since I bought the orange box on Steam I got a peggle with it
3619.7400000000002,3628.86, which I was like amazing. I quickly played through like the like 20 stage Half Life one that
3629.1800000000003,3633.26," came with and then. Oh, come back. I go extremely. Yeah. And then I bought peggle deluxe"
3633.26,3638.1400000000003, like immediately afterwards because I loved it so much. That's actually a good order because the Half Life
3638.1400000000003,3645.02, version is kind of like a after you've you played the original. But that it's like I think it would
3645.02,3650.3, make a great demo for getting the original game. It does. I like that you bought like a brand new computer
3650.3,3655.58," and one straight to go. Yeah. The Brad. Oh, it's true. Since I built a new computer like the"
3655.58,3661.18, first things I put on. Those are too well on quadcar. It was like that and I started playing
3661.18,3668.62, wow again and yeah. And Ralph and Galsive too. Which again. I'm not too far.
3669.42,3674.94," And so besides that then there's always the staple of company heroes with Sean. Which is like,"
3674.94,3680.62," I don't know if my remits has I got a problem. Really? And then there's been a lot of second. Well,"
3680.62,3684.54, there was second life. But I guess we've kind of moved on from that. Oh thank God. And then
3686.14,3694.14," with my girlfriend. I'll go back. Yeah. When I need to revive the penis. Yeah, you know, I have a"
3694.14,3699.34, beef with you because there were a couple of a couple of raids that were going to happen in our
3699.34,3704.22, in our guild and wow that we talk about on legendary thread where it guys didn't show up because
3704.22,3710.22, they were fucking around in second life. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's funny. I saw like tons of people
3710.2999999999997,3715.3399999999997, posting pics and like they took my word for it and we didn't have to sell some fun. Yeah.
3715.3399999999997,3721.5," It's like, hey man, what's this place called T1? You got to go man. 599. You get free drinks all night."
3723.2599999999998,3728.2999999999997, So you're my thanks. I think there's a whole district just for sensual sharding.
3730.8599999999997,3736.4599999999996," But then as far as the games that I guess are new or about to come out, me and Sean have now"
3736.46,3741.42, this started a Plinksensis will empire. Aha. Yes. You have joined the cult. It's
3741.42,3746.38, very true. Right on. You're back to right. A strategy guide for that. What are you? How
3746.38,3751.5, said? Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah. What did you sign yourself up for? I didn't sign myself up.
3751.5,3756.54, That was definitely a last assignment. This is my learn this game. I'm using the third. Yeah.
3756.54,3761.58, That thing. That would be a task. Yeah. A strategy guide for that game. A lot of people
3761.58,3765.66," playing it though. So I think you'll find plenty of sources of, I'm sorry. I called you stupid."
3765.66,3768.54, But that's the thing. You got to be careful because it's like you don't want to just go to
3768.54,3773.34, some like fax site because then people like use you of plagiarizing. Yeah. I'm at
3773.34,3776.94," internal like people here, you know, yeah, friends you're playing with. Yeah. I mean,"
3776.94,3780.7, most of the time it's just done like we play the crap out of it and then write up stuff we've
3780.7,3784.94, seen that works. But the thing is it takes so much time because it would be like if someone asked
3784.94,3788.7799999999997, me in the first week that we were playing company here was when they came out to write the
3788.78,3793.6600000000003," strat. Oh, God. Yeah. If you ask me now two years later, like oh shit. Yeah. You give like entry"
3793.6600000000003,3797.42, level tips and stuff at this point. Yeah. Exactly. That's I guess it's a strategy to develop
3797.42,3800.86," over and yes. Even with the community, people want to figure things up for a long time. Right."
3801.82,3805.98," That's so just beginner like some opening. You know, that's true. Good stuff. I think if you could"
3805.98,3809.98," do a good one, you'd be doing a great service to a lot of people. Yes. Because when you play that"
3809.98,3814.2200000000003," game, when you open it up, my first thing, you know, we got in there and I was like, I was telling"
3814.22,3818.9399999999996," Roy, I was like, all right, just walk me through the build order like one build order, not the"
3818.9399999999996,3825.4199999999996," build, but just one, so I just have a foundation to like, you know, improvise from on subsequent games."
3825.4199999999996,3829.4199999999996, Yeah. Even though I've done like even little stuff like knowing to build up your planets
3829.4199999999996,3834.22," infrastructure first. So it's not yes losing money and then gaining money, stuff about how"
3834.22,3837.66, the pirate or whatever. Yeah. That's totally a good call. That's what I would do. Some like new
3837.66,3840.62, team because you can go wiped off the map if you don't know how to deal with the pirate thing.
3840.62,3843.98, I played it for like five hours and then talked to Sean today and I still learned to like 10
3843.98,3848.94," things I didn't know at all. Right. So, and I asked him how he knew it and he said it was just from playing."
3848.94,3853.98, Like there was never anything that told him. Yeah. The tutorial in the game only gives you like the
3853.98,3859.58," most rudimentary rudimentary instructions and it's kind of broken too. Playing that tutorial man,"
3859.58,3863.74," it was scary. I was like, this is what I'm going to get into and I opened up the tech tree."
3863.74,3868.14," Yeah. That's like, there's like a sub. Yeah. There's a logistics tech tree of no-"
3868.14,3872.8599999999997," there's another one. Each one has three trees within the tree. Yes, with that. And in the"
3872.8599999999997,3878.3799999999997," collectors edition, which I got comes with the fucking pull out folder. It's like a wall poster. That's"
3878.3799999999997,3885.42, the tech tree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was afraid. I said on last week's podcast that I walked it over to
3885.42,3894.2999999999997," EGM to show Shane and Brian. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's a why we hate PC games. Scary. Did there's an every"
3895.02,3900.0600000000004," all three races have their own unique sub-devided tech trees. Yeah. If you learn each side,"
3900.0600000000004,3905.02," yeah, it's it's daunting. The fact that there's I want to meet whoever hung that poster up."
3906.0600000000004,3912.94, That's kind of garage next to Cindy Crawford for my 1982. Yeah. Change the oil. I'm going to
3912.94,3920.7000000000003," learn how to play the Zarkon some. Zarkon are good. I should do that. I should, you know, I"
3920.7,3926.2999999999997," just just like particularly freaked my wife out. You know, replaced the Monet print. Just start putting"
3926.2999999999997,3929.8999999999996, this shit up. See how she really is. I'm going to say it's all our empire. You've never
3929.8999999999996,3935.1, used to take it up. I have it. I have to be honest. I have never put any that kind of shit on my wall.
3935.1,3939.5, I guess I always wondered why it comes in. EGM routinely would pack in posters and stuff and
3939.5,3943.8199999999997," it'd be like, why are they? I guess I'm doing this. I guess I'm one of those Dorkanomalies because"
3943.8199999999997,3947.58," you know, living in like the clan houses that used to live like seven people when you'd enter. There was"
3947.58,3953.02," like a clan houses. Yeah. Well, I lived with eight people during the siege. Hong. And just saying"
3953.02,3956.14," there was eight of us. Yeah. So we were like, we had the same thing. We had a lot of reacted."
3956.14,3960.7, Planet of Cape bear not the fucking Kuklook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There were a clan. Maybe I said.
3960.7,3964.54," I don't know. But yeah, when the soon as you walk in, there's like, you mean the kind of four by six"
3964.54,3972.7," foot like poster of map of middle earth like in our, I didn't know how to. You go in the garage and it was"
3972.7,3977.02," like the women like the man, women hated cover whatever. Like we're playing war hammer. We're like,"
3977.02,3981.74, no girlfriend's allowed. If someone had a girlfriend. Dude. Yeah. That's like a soothing. Yeah.
3981.74,3985.18," Yeah. That's your way to. Well, that's not how girlfriends because they would just interfere. Exactly."
3986.46,3991.34, Yeah. I had a middle middle earth poster up when I was a kid. That was probably the last time I did that.
3991.34,3995.5, Hook it up. Let's do an experiment and see what your wife's wife does. That would be great. I do that.
3995.5,4000.78," That would make a great show of it. Not show, but a clip for game videos because the game's also got"
4000.86,4007.7400000000002, like posters of screenshots. And of course the game is because it's meant to hold up when you're
4007.7400000000002,4012.0600000000004, looking at things unlike this galactic level. It's not going to be that detailed when you zoom into
4012.0600000000004,4016.46, it actual ship. And then the posters like a couple of the ships pretty close to each other fighting.
4016.46,4022.1400000000003," So it looks all like ghetto legos, you know. Oh, hey, I wouldn't say that. I would say that that bad. Yeah."
4022.7000000000003,4027.1000000000004," Right. But I see. Well, I've seen better space videos. Even though many of them. Even if it was a"
4027.1,4033.18," painting worthy of like a sci-fi paperback, which isn't saying much. Right. Who would hang it up?"
4033.18,4037.42," But Jeff, you need to do it. I challenge you. I've done it. Then I need to take I can't"
4037.42,4043.02, just sit in. It's just a free act. It's over in his eyes. You want mine? They're still in my box
4043.02,4048.06, if you want them. I have the box. I just haven't hung it up yet. Okay. Yeah. Being the key word.
4048.06,4051.5, Now that you know the right there. Are you going to go and look at them tonight? Probably.
4051.98,4058.46, I wish it was a cloth map. The cloth map. Yeah. That's another video. I wanted to do. I
4058.46,4064.06, actually proposed this to the game videos guys. What did they say? Ryan knows a video. What role
4064.06,4070.94," on your eyes, man? I know. He's talking. Yeah. Yeah. This is my last podcast. Get your train."
4070.94,4077.58," Then there we know more of these stories. So there's a, I went over to them and we were going through"
4077.58,4081.98, all their old boxes from our library and looking at all the cloth maps and the characters edition.
4081.98,4085.2599999999998, And I just wanted to do like it and absorb and see test with them. Like it.
4085.98,4091.18, Dijkers or if you can. Some of that blue liquid. Yeah. You do the blue liquid stuff on them.
4092.2999999999997,4097.5, That was I had one hang in there. I had one more in cloth today. Yeah. That was really unpleasant.
4097.5,4102.78, You had some map around you. Growing. So fantasy world map. They assume he was fully closed.
4103.099999999999,4108.46," No, yes. He did have a he had pants on. But that's like I never wanted his at that"
4108.46,4114.139999999999, continent again. Because the cloth is at least like it's around a little longer than the paper.
4115.099999999999,4119.58," So why I mean the paper is like, okay, that's that's for my recycling bin. But the cloth map"
4119.58,4123.9, who uses those? Like we pull that out and lay it across your dashboard of your your expedition
4123.9,4129.099999999999, and the idea of the ever quest map on my wall. So did I. I needed to get around.
4129.42,4134.46," Yeah, actually no one gave up in that game. That's true. I did that too. That's true because"
4135.02,4138.06, it was a lot of it. It was a lot of it. It's a reason. That's right. And then you stick
4138.06,4143.1, in for you. Because they did not have this in game out. They were so stinty. They didn't want to have
4143.1,4147.740000000001, one. They only were very reluctantly years later put out that out. It was part of the vision.
4147.740000000001,4152.700000000001, Right. I don't know why they were just being explored. That was it. That was a reason.
4153.26,4157.26, You had to explore. Some reason you wouldn't have access to this. But it's crazy. You would actually
4157.26,4161.5," go to websites and like, you know, people would map it. Yeah. You would just like download other"
4161.5,4166.38, people's maps just to have a visual reference. It was crazy. I used to have a text file during
4166.38,4170.62, during the brief time. I played it because I used to have a text file filled with coordinates.
4171.42,4176.06," Yep, coordinate. Because like you had to. You just find it out yourself like where this"
4176.780000000001,4180.54," point of interest is at this coordinate. Yeah, I would. I would. I would show you all these days."
4180.54,4183.820000000001," Might in magic maps. I do like the arts. I do like the arts. I do like the idea. Just I mean,"
4183.9,4188.139999999999," just exploring in a game. There's not, you know, I mean, not even that, but just actual like"
4188.139999999999,4192.7," contours of a continent, you know, the landmass and looking for islands. There was really something to"
4192.7,4197.34," this. Yeah. There was something to that. Yeah. I mean, I do miss that a bit and wow. It's like"
4197.34,4202.0599999999995, there's no sense of like wonders you're coming over the horizon. Like you kind of know it's over there.
4202.0599999999995,4208.78," Yeah. Well, it would be frustrating and everquest for sure. It was a hard core frustration. But there"
4208.86,4214.78," was also the sense of discovery, too. There really is not there. Yeah. Every inch of wow has been"
4214.78,4219.9," mapped out. I mean, it, but you don't have to look at those, right? But it's so freaking tempting."
4219.9,4224.0599999999995," Yeah. You know, you can't help it. I mean, just last night I was playing wow and I was in"
4224.78,4229.9, Niagara and that was in the area where I hadn't done any quest yet even though I'm 70 now. And
4229.9,4235.58," so I was faced with all these new quests. And I totally as soon as I got the quest, I barely"
4235.66,4241.18," read the quest text. But I just looked at what I was going to get. Quest text. And then, and then,"
4241.18,4245.42," you know, instead of like looking at the description that said like it go to the northeast corner of"
4245.42,4251.5," this, I just went straight to Alixeam and found the exact numerical coordinates. Okay, Quest go to"
4251.5,4258.3," 42 72. There he has boom dead. Dude, I'll do like like like four different from no fun man. I know."
4258.3,4263.58," If you want to be the lovers, I took up the love. I got Magellan, Captain Cook, or do you want to be"
4263.58,4274.46," in dude with the GPS and that's Ryan. I've got a record in it, I'm out. I've got like a quest helper"
4274.46,4280.3, thing that feeds like wow head data into a pain next to my quest log. And points. You click on a
4280.3,4284.3, quest objective and it'll show the coordinate to pinpoint on your map. That's what I'm going to have.
4284.3,4289.0199999999995, You have to get the mod that plays the game for you. And I have like a bet. The quest helper mod that
4289.02,4293.02," like draws like the most efficient line between your quest. Right. See, you need the one or more"
4293.02,4298.22," mod just does the quest. Yeah, Ryan, and then you're going to sleep. Oh, great. I've heard a total"
4298.22,4302.700000000001, of my guy. You're probably one thing I think. It's because you can automate so much of it. Cool.
4303.42,4307.580000000001, That's one thing that I didn't don't understand about why I was ever locked in to put in game
4307.580000000001,4313.26," coordinates. Yes, that's true. You know what? They're there in incorporating a bunch of"
4313.9800000000005,4316.3, commonly used add-on functionality. Are they?
4316.3,4320.46, X patch. So he sounds like they might just be admitted to feet in that case because they were kind of
4320.46,4324.78," adamant about the coordinates. Yeah, the other thing that bothers me about the mapping,"
4324.78,4329.900000000001, even though they do give you so much is you'll discover a new area. And then they don't put that on the
4329.900000000001,4333.900000000001," map. I feel like well, if I've just if you're putting a thing in the game that says you've"
4333.900000000001,4339.900000000001, not discovered whatever areas landing. Why is areas landing not on the map? And minor quipple.
4340.379999999999,4344.86, So I can bury three out of everywhere. We haven't had a podcast in the background
4344.86,4349.0199999999995, when you're in the room when your wife's discovering the the true post-robo.
4351.5,4355.74, I blame it on my mother. She enabled me too much. She still has
4356.54,4361.42, photos birthday on the calendar at her house. Wow. Because I put it on there one year.
4361.42,4364.139999999999," And she's like, I'm going to put photos birthday on every here. It's for you."
4364.700000000001,4369.660000000001," Like, thanks. Wow. So I went home for Christmas. I'm like, it's a birthday on her. I haven't"
4369.660000000001,4372.62," lived here in seven years. It's still putting photos birthday into calendars. Like, yep."
4372.62,4377.18, So when is first birthday? I don't even remember. It's September or something. Wow.
4377.58,4380.860000000001," That's very touching. There's a certain similarity between the way that like, you know,"
4380.860000000001,4385.820000000001," Ryan and Anthony and Shawn, the way that you're all talking about this with, you know, when you're"
4385.820000000001,4388.62," with like, grease monkeys or something and they're talking about the new camshaft, they're just"
4388.62,4392.62, through where they're selling the camera. But the differences is that you're always you're always
4392.62,4397.82," aware. Unlike the guy who talking about this new manifold, who's like, it can't get it through"
4397.82,4402.0599999999995, his mind that the manifold's not going to be as exciting to every single person on the planet.
4402.0599999999995,4407.099999999999," Yeah. Yeah. You're kind of like aware that, yeah, I did this. But I want to see you guys come"
4407.099999999999,4411.82," through with this shit like the guy in this new manifold. Like, just like bring that shit next time."
4411.82,4416.7," Like when you're talking about how you got under control, yeah, that's called bringing that"
4416.7,4421.34," ish. To be bring the addition legendary thread, where we assume everyone does care about the"
4421.34,4425.82, manifold. Yeah. We do. I listen to it. And that's not like to me. Cool.
4425.82,4431.58, I'm going to get you on that one day. Straight up poster. Hang in right above my monitor.
4432.38,4436.46," Show everyone the come over. Give me a little tour. Man, I have to show you"
4436.46,4442.62, that pictures of my old bedroom. I would like this boy. I got a place for those called the internet.
4444.62,4450.9400000000005," I was too bad. To give us a sample. Like what, what kind of wonder would we see in that"
4450.94,4456.94," bedroom if he was. Oh, God. There were any S and Game Boy boxes all over the walls. You're"
4456.94,4460.94," hanging them on the wall. Yep. Anthony, why are you popping a fist? That's right."
4460.94,4465.82," That's a bad one. Yeah. So what, what did you got both of you guys? That's my last bedroom."
4465.82,4469.419999999999, Had three Star Wars posters. And I had a tiny as bedroom. Three Star Wars posters.
4469.419999999999,4476.299999999999, A warhammer online poster. Wow. Wow. That was a key. That's how you want to do.
4476.299999999999,4479.82, You're going to work out the more on your ceiling. I had to wake up and just just
4479.82,4487.099999999999," all posters. I had to keep in common. God, I can't. I'm sure I had many video game posters."
4487.099999999999,4491.66, I don't remember specifics. But there were some geeky as posters hanging all over my room.
4491.66,4496.78, I had movie posters. Lots of movie posters. But I worked with the theater. And I got them for free.
4497.42,4501.82, So I'd have like shit like man's best friend up. I had action figures. Everyone too.
4501.82,4506.299999999999, I love it. It was a little bit more paper around the house. We had our butt.
4506.860000000001,4511.1, That one. I want to hear what you guys keep in crimdating.
4515.1,4519.1," The grand inquisitor of this shit. Ryan, what else did you have in that fucking bedroom?"
4519.1,4522.3," There's action figures. There's all the like Final Fantasy 8, the whole set."
4523.5,4525.820000000001, Big years. That's a hard action figures on the floor.
4525.820000000001,4526.38, On open.
4526.38,4527.18, Hang on.
4527.18,4528.62," On open. No, that's for key."
4528.62,4529.26, Yeah.
4529.26,4533.26," Unopened. That's an extra thing. Wait, did you have them on your wall?"
4533.5,4537.1, Because I saw a picture of that. You had a fucking unopened action figure.
4537.1,4538.38, Pinging on the wall. Yes.
4538.38,4541.820000000001, I had a whole series about it mounted on the wall.
4541.820000000001,4542.860000000001," Yeah, like home."
4542.860000000001,4543.5, Unpened.
4547.1,4548.54, I wish you could take a picture of Sean.
4551.58,4554.22, Anthony's coloring because he's not the worst to address.
4554.22,4559.02," That's like the red of you can, you could, in my head, that's like taking like a fucking soy sauce packet."
4559.02,4561.02, That's a totally blue tag.
4561.9800000000005,4563.580000000001," That's a bit of a roof here, Dorm."
4563.580000000001,4564.620000000001, How's this version?
4564.620000000001,4566.700000000001, Having an intendial game box on the wall.
4567.9800000000005,4570.14," You know, like the same as the long width."
4570.14,4572.9400000000005, The same thing as I don't understand why it is ridiculous to you.
4572.9400000000005,4575.02," I'm just like, why it's ridiculous."
4575.02,4575.9800000000005, What's wrong with this?
4575.9800000000005,4576.46, What's wrong with this?
4576.46,4577.02, This is cool.
4577.02,4582.700000000001," Well, did either, I mean, I get too personal, but did either of you guys entertain the company of women in these rooms"
4582.700000000001,4583.580000000001, in this state?
4584.22,4584.860000000001, Yes.
4584.860000000001,4585.02, Yes.
4587.42,4589.02, We'll see they must have been very cool.
4589.02,4593.02," Oh, gosh, oh, god, what did they do for this from Yalu?"
4593.02,4595.1, Who's the person who's broken Sean?
4595.820000000001,4596.46, What is it from?
4596.46,4597.18, You know what?
4597.18,4601.34," I'm saying, like, I'm very fortunate that my girlfriend is like, it's big a geek as I am."
4601.34,4602.3, That is very cool.
4602.3,4604.14, So that's that her room is the same thing.
4604.14,4605.740000000001," There's a little pony, like,"
4605.740000000001,4608.38," or take it by the hair, hanging off the ceiling fan."
4609.660000000001,4614.14," In our apartment, our apartment's a little more normal than my old friend lives."
4615.740000000001,4618.9400000000005," But I mean, you know, like, we got like an iron man."
4619.02,4620.540000000001, Movie poster from somewhere.
4620.540000000001,4622.700000000001," She's like, who will have to aim into the kitchen?"
4622.700000000001,4624.06," Wow, okay."
4624.06,4626.620000000001," Wow, you're living a geek stream there."
4626.620000000001,4628.14," Carbon, say, times."
4628.14,4629.740000000001, I think mine was probably a...
4629.740000000001,4631.740000000001, Reins are made on the street.
4633.740000000001,4635.1, What about you at the least?
4635.1,4636.14, So what did the woman think?
4636.14,4639.660000000001," Well, I think mine was probably more terrifying experience, because like when they'd meet me,"
4639.660000000001,4641.5," and college and stuff, they'd have no idea."
4641.5,4644.700000000001," Like, I wouldn't talk about video games and stuff like that, and then they'd come over and"
4644.700000000001,4646.3," it's like, works."
4646.3,4647.9800000000005, There you look at the outside.
4647.98,4653.339999999999," Like, how are you gonna kick it though when you got the more hammer-on-line poster right over the bed?"
4654.379999999999,4655.66," It's like, it's like mootkill."
4655.66,4658.219999999999," You're like, you're like, you're like, you got a berry white on the stairs."
4658.219999999999,4659.179999999999," She's like, let me light a candle."
4659.179999999999,4661.98," No, no, no, no, that'll black in some of my warmer posters."
4663.419999999999,4665.66," It's like a test if she's not with it, then exactly."
4665.66,4667.82, I was on a apologetic about it.
4667.82,4669.5, That's the way to beat it then.
4669.5,4670.139999999999, Right on.
4670.139999999999,4671.099999999999, And you still kicked it.
4671.099999999999,4673.82," That's like the dude who's got the all the sports skills,"
4673.82,4678.54," or it didn't match some stuff like taped up in his garage, and he still kicks it in there."
4678.54,4679.34, That's how it's.
4679.34,4681.179999999999, That's how it's gonna do to make that.
4683.74,4684.219999999999, Right on the floor.
4684.219999999999,4685.58, None of the sounds for it underneath me.
4685.58,4686.86, I don't know where we got from here.
4687.259999999999,4689.259999999999, Excavation's mainly a breakdown.
4689.259999999999,4690.219999999999," Yeah, aren't you all there?"
4690.86,4692.139999999999," Nerdroom, archaeologists."
4692.94,4696.0599999999995," Yeah, I don't even remember I've been domesticated for so long."
4696.0599999999995,4697.58," Rummage, inter-round, through that stuff."
4698.0599999999995,4702.94," And I have a daughter too, so I don't have a, like, you know, a dorky son who would"
4703.259999999999,4704.86, further enable that back.
4704.86,4707.98," Yeah, where you're like, kind of like looking at him like, oh man."
4708.54,4710.0599999999995," No, no, I would support it."
4710.0599999999995,4710.54, Support it.
4710.54,4711.179999999999, What is right?
4711.179999999999,4711.5, What is right?
4711.5,4712.299999999999, What is right?
4712.299999999999,4714.46, I would have been living by Carrie C through him if he had.
4714.46,4715.82," Well, there's the age thing too."
4715.82,4719.5," And then it is like, you're talking about college years, at least that, well, Ryan, I don't know."
4719.5,4721.419999999999," You've got to Iron Man Post, you're not going to leave you."
4722.219999999999,4724.139999999999, Because I fucking made me change in your head.
4724.139999999999,4727.82," But you're in your college years, and that's like, when in college,"
4727.82,4731.179999999999," did you ever go to like a fellow like a peers place,"
4731.26,4736.14," and it wasn't actually like a cess pit of some, you know, like a very, very, very, very"
4736.14,4737.14, important.
4737.14,4743.26," My dorm room in, you know, I lived in a dorm at UC Berkeley, my freshman year, and it was"
4744.06,4749.5," eight stories, I think, and our room, my roommate, we won messiest room of the whole building."
4749.740000000001,4751.5, And it was a fucking pit.
4752.06,4754.14," It was, it was no room."
4754.14,4755.34, There was no floor.
4755.34,4756.54, We had no floor at all.
4757.26,4758.3, It was grotesque.
4758.3,4758.780000000001, Yeah.
4759.099999999999,4764.0599999999995," That roommate Derek Evans had the beauty of the week from like some kind of like,"
4764.0599999999995,4765.259999999999, Ebony Magazine or something.
4765.259999999999,4768.86," And then we put them all on this wall, but they're fully new, though, what's the thing?"
4768.86,4772.7," So it wasn't Ebony, but it was they were fully new, and beauties of the week, and he would just"
4772.7,4779.259999999999," line them up each each time he would get him, and he would tell me, like, I just, I just like,"
4779.259999999999,4782.46," looking at these, and I wake up in a morning, it makes me feel good looking at this, and he's like,"
4782.46,4784.219999999999," you know, you could put some stuff up too if you want."
4784.54,4785.42," And I was like, I can't."
4785.82,4786.46, That's cool.
4786.46,4787.099999999999, I really wanted to.
4788.06,4791.34," I was like, and I was breaking my girlfriend Lindsay over to the dormant that's all the time,"
4791.34,4795.26," which was heinous in and of itself, because I'm sure it's a single tiny ass room."
4795.26,4798.3, And we had this system where we'd put like a fucking rubber band on the handle.
4798.3,4798.700000000001, Yeah.
4798.700000000001,4800.38," Don't fucking come in this door, dude."
4800.38,4801.820000000001, And he would always be so drunk.
4801.820000000001,4803.660000000001, He would never notice the fucking rubber band.
4804.06,4807.5," And like, one time a, like, Derek, just fucking beauty of the week on the wall."
4808.14,4809.660000000001, Here I got the rubber band on the door.
4809.660000000001,4810.54, What's it going to take?
4810.9400000000005,4812.780000000001, And then the same guy.
4813.34,4816.62," He, uh, he also would, would have these like,"
4816.62,4819.179999999999, porn-over viewing sessions and have all of friends over.
4819.66,4821.259999999999, But I picked up a few good lines from that.
4821.259999999999,4823.9, I just want to say this because there's a rhyme to remember.
4823.9,4825.66, One of them was satisfaction Jackson.
4826.62,4827.66, I haven't told you this.
4827.66,4828.7, Don't know what I think.
4828.7,4830.219999999999, So satisfaction Jackson.
4830.219999999999,4831.5, And the plot of this movie.
4832.0599999999995,4833.0199999999995, That's the name of the movie.
4833.0199999999995,4833.42, Yeah.
4833.42,4836.62, This satisfaction was basically like a surrogate that you provide.
4836.62,4838.78," When you can't, when you can't pleasure your wife properly,"
4838.78,4840.54, you bring her into satisfaction Jackson.
4840.54,4842.219999999999, And he'll he got you covered.
4843.179999999999,4843.66, Okay.
4843.66,4844.219999999999, Okay.
4844.219999999999,4845.5, That's one of the things that I'm living with.
4845.5,4848.139999999999, This was one of these red like cross-court
4848.139999999999,4850.219999999999," show experiences at the time because I was like,"
4851.259999999999,4852.219999999999, let's meet different people.
4852.219999999999,4853.82," He, so we're watching this."
4853.82,4856.46," And the group of his friends and the first thing is there's this,"
4856.46,4858.219999999999," like, really scrawny guy."
4858.219999999999,4859.5, And that was the husband.
4860.219999999999,4862.78," And he comes in and he's with his, uh,"
4862.78,4864.86," and he's with his wife and she's, of course,"
4864.86,4867.179999999999," the porn-over-star, you know, doesn't make any sense."
4867.82,4871.259999999999," And then she's like, my, my husband brings home plenty of bacon."
4871.74,4873.34, But not enough pork.
4873.34,4874.06," And he's like,"
4874.06,4877.34," to back woman, you know, damn well, my expertise is designed."
4877.34,4879.1, That computer's not fucking pussy.
4879.1,4883.66," And then like, that, I mean, this is, this is an exploitation movie."
4883.66,4885.02," So, did I log this?"
4885.02,4887.1, Is that bad?
4887.1,4888.9400000000005," And then like, it was all quiet."
4888.9400000000005,4890.46," Like, because I wanted to laugh at that."
4891.18,4892.54, Because it was really funny.
4892.54,4894.7," I was like, I don't want anyone to think the wrong thing."
4894.7,4895.820000000001," If I got, I don't want to think like,"
4895.820000000001,4897.9800000000005," to you through that guy, it's just like Peter's."
4898.94,4900.94," And then someone else, the Derek's friends, like,"
4900.94,4902.94," fucking, you know, design computers."
4902.94,4905.259999999999, And then everyone starts cracking up.
4905.259999999999,4908.139999999999," But then the, the good line from that movie was, um,"
4908.139999999999,4912.299999999999," after satisfaction with, with sort of present his course on"
4912.299999999999,4914.299999999999," the art of satisfaction, he broke it, uh,"
4914.299999999999,4917.099999999999," the guy, the husband broke it down as such observing."
4917.099999999999,4919.9," He said, actually, I can't play this."
4921.9,4922.94," Down the soul, scarring."
4922.94,4924.299999999999," Oh, it was not building up for this."
4924.299999999999,4926.7," And I was like, about to sit on like, actually, I can't."
4927.66,4929.42, But how could you do that one day?
4929.42,4931.34," Yeah, I want to hear this."
4931.34,4932.22, Maybe I'll let it go.
4932.22,4935.34," This is bad. And now like, okay."
4936.46,4938.3, I'll mark the time. Maybe I'll put our marker.
4938.3,4939.26, The time to put a warning.
4939.26,4942.62," Okay. If you are under 18, or if you have any taste whatsoever,"
4942.62,4944.22, you should have stopped this thing a long ago.
4944.22,4945.26, A long time ago.
4945.26,4948.7," So the guy was watching and like, as he's supposedly watching this wife"
4948.7,4951.9," being pleasure, he's like, pulls out his hand in front of him."
4951.9,4953.82," And he starts counting an office like,"
4953.9,4956.219999999999," lick, stroke, kiss, suck."
4956.219999999999,4958.0599999999995, Only then did you give your fuck.
4958.0599999999995,4959.0199999999995, Make him happy.
4959.0199999999995,4960.62, It's the main attraction.
4960.62,4962.78, But just call it Saddest Faction.
4963.82,4969.74," So that went with the, uh, through the rest of my, my, my education."
4969.74,4972.219999999999, So that's a rhyme you continue to tie yourself here.
4972.219999999999,4973.0199999999995, That was my great.
4973.0199999999995,4973.42, That was my great.
4973.42,4974.219999999999," I was like, you're getting a good one."
4974.219999999999,4975.66, That's a little bit right there.
4975.66,4976.46, That was it.
4976.46,4977.82, That was the switch.
4977.82,4978.299999999999, Hip hop.
4979.5,4980.94, All right. On that note.
4980.94,4981.42, Okay.
4981.42,4982.46, I got to get out of here.
4983.42,4985.02, Right. It's been K said at the room.
4985.02,4989.42," The fucking the Iron Man Iron Man secret, uh, research center weights."
4993.1,4996.78," What's bad though is when you get, don't get to the point where you make so much money"
4996.78,5001.02," that the posters no longer set his factory and you start buying like the, the, the, the"
5001.02,5002.86," replica arm, our Iron Man armor."
5002.86,5003.26, Okay.
5003.26,5005.9," No, that's putting it in like a glass case."
5005.9,5006.7, That's okay.
5006.7,5007.66, Never say never.
5007.66,5009.74," I don't, I'm gonna say never."
5010.38,5011.74, Okay.
5011.74,5012.54, All right.
5012.54,5014.38, I have a train to catch.
5014.38,5015.34," All right, Mr. Scott."
5015.34,5016.139999999999, Goodbye.
5016.139999999999,5016.94, We'll see you next week.
5020.139999999999,5020.78, Bye Ryan.
5020.78,5021.34, Bye.
5021.34,5021.98, Sorry.
5021.98,5022.86, Now that he's got story.
5023.74,5026.54, And now we thought about the real line from that movie.
5026.94,5029.58," Because that one was that, that was the Ryan Mollner as one."
5030.38,5030.7, Not.
5033.34,5034.219999999999, Oh god.
5034.219999999999,5036.219999999999, So we had a for editing that out.
5036.219999999999,5037.98," Yeah, we actually had actual news items."
5038.0599999999995,5040.219999999999," They got, and we replaced it with porn talk."
5040.219999999999,5041.259999999999," Well, we can hit a lot."
5041.259999999999,5042.62, That's part for the course.
5042.62,5044.299999999999, I don't know.
5044.299999999999,5045.66, I don't know if it's all I think.
5045.66,5046.7, I'm not gonna say that word.
5047.66,5047.98, Why don't you?
5047.98,5048.94, Huh?
5048.94,5050.299999999999, What should I do?
5050.299999999999,5051.66, I'll hit us up with some news.
5051.66,5052.459999999999, Okay.
5052.459999999999,5054.379999999999, Here's the news segment of our podcast.
5054.379999999999,5055.98," Uh,"
5056.86,5058.62, usually I'll support talk.
5058.62,5059.0199999999995, Yeah.
5059.0199999999995,5059.179999999999, Yeah.
5059.179999999999,5059.9, That's the old bad.
5059.9,5061.339999999999," I'm like, actually, he's shaved a whistle."
5061.339999999999,5062.299999999999, Yeah.
5062.299999999999,5062.7, I don't know.
5062.7,5063.5, I don't know.
5063.5,5064.86, I'm gonna be in like five more minutes.
5064.86,5065.5, Yeah.
5065.5,5066.299999999999, Yeah.
5066.299999999999,5066.86, Okay.
5067.339999999999,5069.74," Well, there were two related, uh,"
5069.74,5072.299999999999, MMO news things or semi related things that came up.
5072.299999999999,5076.46," Uh, one with over at gama sutra gama sutra.com."
5077.82,5079.5," They, uh, uh,"
5079.5,5082.7," made the announcement that the NPD group, the group that"
5082.7,5086.0599999999995," is notorious for reporting, uh,"
5086.0599999999995,5091.179999999999," sales of, uh, of software video game software, uh,"
5091.179999999999,5093.5," and computer game software, um,"
5093.5,5094.86, I shouldn't say notorious.
5094.94,5097.42, I'm only using that word because of late.
5097.42,5101.66," There's been a lot of controversy about how they report on, uh,"
5101.66,5103.42, sales of PC games.
5103.42,5105.82," And there's been a lot of complaints about them not, uh,"
5105.82,5108.62," covering uh, subscription games like MMO."
5108.62,5111.98," And so, uh, they announced today as reported by gama sutra,"
5111.98,5115.259999999999, a new initiative to track the online market for software.
5115.259999999999,5120.0599999999995," Uh, NPD says, uh, the reports will, uh, uh,"
5121.099999999999,5124.78," will chart, quote chart market size and title shares for MMO."
5124.94,5129.66," PC games, gaming websites and game console services like Xbox Live."
5129.66,5134.38," Any service that gets revenue from paid online subscriptions, uh,"
5134.38,5137.5," said NPD vice president Martin Zagart,"
5137.5,5142.3, sec quote to these products are an important step towards NPD's ultimate goal
5142.3,5147.98," providing a truly complete view of the North American PC game and video game markets,"
5147.98,5151.34," including all the different ways consumers pay for and play video games,"
5151.34,5153.42, PC games and related products.
5153.5,5155.02, So that's good news. Right.
5155.74,5160.7," Yeah. Don't we think it's a good step on that note the last, uh, NPD also surprised"
5160.7,5162.9400000000005, it had parts of the burning sea on there.
5162.9400000000005,5165.1," Yeah. I know. So yeah, that was cool."
5165.1,5167.82, On the North's total for all top 10 or was it?
5167.82,5169.82, Oh wow. A series. Yep.
5169.82,5172.22, You guys were all excited about it.
5172.22,5174.78, I Ryan is special in playing it a little bit.
5174.78,5177.18," What about you Jeff and I know Ryan hasn't well,"
5177.18,5181.66, I mentioned that I created my character Peppey Lepue and I was having trouble in the early
5181.74,5186.38," going at the French town. And after that, I lost a little bit interest,"
5186.38,5189.34, but I'll try to get back to it. I wasn't joined the ship combat.
5189.34,5194.86, The little I did. What about you Anthony? You like? Yeah. I'm a level four Spanish
5194.86,5200.22, wave fair. I think it was a warm cold. Is that pirate? No. No.
5200.22,5203.0199999999995, I figured everyone was going to go right there. I think that's what I had tried.
5203.0199999999995,5205.58, So I tried to go something that wasn't pirate. Is that kind of like
5205.58,5207.58, something that you're searching for? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
5207.58,5211.82, So I am a French wave fair. Yeah. I don't know. Antonio Gagos.
5211.82,5215.0199999999995, That's my ex-heating. My real name. Wow. That's so nice.
5215.0199999999995,5220.38, So he doesn't look anything. What do you do? Is it just like some version of grinding so far?
5221.26,5226.22," A little bit. I was actually surprised how instant it is. Like every time like take on a quest,"
5226.22,5229.5, it'll be like the city's under attack and you'll exit the door of the room. You're in and
5229.5,5232.94, you'll be in like a fake version of the city that's on fire and stuff like that.
5232.94,5235.98, With people that are in your party. If you're partyed?
5236.0599999999995,5240.299999999999, Yeah. Or just by yourself. So like all the other people players that we're running around the town
5240.299999999999,5244.299999999999, are now no longer there. But it's like it's still pretty cool. Yeah. I like it all right.
5245.5,5249.9, Okay. I think like Adrian Conan does that like at the event. I went to a couple of
5249.9,5254.7," weeks ago they instanced the town by making you go to sleep. So if you click on a bed,"
5254.7,5257.58, you get the nighttime version and there's no one around. Which actually was kind of an
5257.58,5261.5, interesting way to make it not so obvious you're at an instance.
5262.14,5268.38, Mm-hmm. But that just seems more too many instances is just counterintuitive to the whole point of
5268.38,5272.3, Emma Mos. Yeah. Well then you're kind of more like in a guild wars scenario or something where
5273.26,5277.5, I don't know. I guess maybe they're just afraid of people messing with you or something. I don't know.
5277.5,5280.7, Sometimes it's the only way to do something like you describe like if you want to
5281.1,5285.9, make the town explode. If someone else is sailing around the town and just spontaneously
5285.9,5289.82, combust it's gonna be like what the hell? What date is the game set in?
5292.62,5295.82," So it's all three of you have been playing it pirates? Yeah, I haven't actually I was"
5295.82,5298.62, no no um I'm talking about sins of the solar empire.
5301.5,5306.299999999999," Yeah, I like I don't want to see like a pirate song game we're talking about two seconds ago."
5306.86,5311.259999999999, Or the one two hours ago. Like what if I mean what century I want to say it's a 16th
5311.34,5315.9800000000005, but I'm not sure. Okay and so it's possibly 17th. Is it possibly that?
5315.9800000000005,5320.14, Going back to our talk about maps and stuff. Well if it's 16th I mean like his entire world charted at
5320.14,5324.38, that point. No just the Caribbean you only sail. Yeah you only sail. Oh that's okay duh. Yeah.
5325.1,5330.54, I'm not necessarily duh. Burning sea. Burning sea can be anywhere. It's true. Okay because I was saying
5330.54,5335.900000000001, that would be a fun sort of a game to have that element of exploration and discovery. Especially
5335.9,5341.98, can go around the world you know good Paul Neasian stuff like that. That's expansion here. Yeah.
5341.98,5348.7, So another thing on the sales is that Amazon's list had since a solar empire like I think was like
5348.7,5355.339999999999, number two last week and it was very well-for-worked. It's really cool to see the kind of buzz that
5355.339999999999,5361.98, this game has you know it seems unexpected to me but it's so good I think it's just kind of
5362.299999999999,5367.259999999999, transcending you know. It'll play on on yeah it does surprise me when I looked at this
5367.259999999999,5372.0599999999995, this is my first 4x game even though it's kind of like 4x RTS hybrid you know when and I'm like
5372.86,5379.98, and then you guys explain that Gal Siv is basically this but with even like more rudimentary combat
5379.98,5385.66, if any. Yeah just as complicated I'm like God and these games sell so well same thing with Siv you know.
5386.219999999999,5390.379999999999, It's like it's surprising but that's reassuring though because it's like they take a lot of investment
5390.46,5394.38, but you don't associate it with like when a lot of times when you think games it's so well
5395.1,5398.54, just at any place you're like God's gotta be the guy that goes in the Walmart and gets like
5399.26,5403.900000000001, redneck rampage and like a bell's big game hunter part 16 but it's like clearly.
5404.7,5408.54, Yeah there's there's yeah like the combat in the right group. The comment in these you mentioned that
5408.54,5413.42, you're talking about this earlier it's nothing like they say I art RTS in the you know and the
5413.42,5418.54, acronym they make up but it's nothing like I'm the level of a starcraft or a company or no one's going to be
5418.62,5424.46, screened by battling it up but but again it's way more complicated than like a Gal Siv 2 situation
5424.46,5429.74, where you're literally your stack of ships has certain numerical value and you compare it to the
5429.74,5434.38, other stack of ships numerical value and then you put one on top of the other and then math results
5434.38,5440.54, it all and like Gal Siv 2 you have the option to watch this ship which I've done like once it's
5440.54,5445.9, the most boring thing in the world to watch a simulation play out based on the numbers in your stack
5446.62,5450.94, but that that is what the combat is I mean literally you move one on top the other and then one disappears
5450.94,5455.58, it's like it works though because it's not just military combat all the right that's such a
5455.58,5462.139999999999, good yeah you're just a whole big picture which you know Gal Siv has that too and since the
5462.139999999999,5467.9, silver has that too and you know more complicated tactical battles which is human
5468.7,5471.74, I like it a lot I'm still addicted
5473.5,5476.7, great game I know it's gonna take me some time excited I'm supposed to
5477.42,5480.299999999999, if you'd ever played civilization or anything like that I'll be interesting to see what
5480.299999999999,5486.139999999999, do how you feel about it I'm not sure if I do yet I'm really interested in the the notion of
5486.139999999999,5491.0199999999995, I mean I see the potential in the same way I like devcon but which is like a super simplistic form
5491.0199999999995,5495.82, of it when you get when you get for more people in the game the more people the better
5495.82,5501.66, yeah that way you can have these like really shaky alliances and in backstabbing and
5502.38,5507.42, duplicity and all sorts of like cool things like that helping each other out because the combat
5507.42,5511.42, itself since that doesn't seem like that's ever going to be satisfying to me and did you ever
5511.42,5518.219999999999, play the plot but no I didn't know I probably didn't even have a computer then no more often than
5518.219999999999,5523.58, not in sins of a soul empire I'm not really my commanding to come at that much because
5524.38,5528.46, you kind of you don't necessarily last so afliat but they're in there's a little bit of
5528.46,5532.0599999999995, making sure like the long range guys are hitting who's supposed to be and the capships are
5532.0599999999995,5536.38, using the powers that they're supposed to but other than that yes I don't necessarily
5537.34,5542.46, get to into it but the big the big moves on the risks board so to speak are the fun ones when
5542.46,5549.66, you're actually in the jet and you're maneuvering to come through to guard certain wormholes
5549.66,5552.46, where you're gonna converge on an enemy at the same time or you're gonna actually like block
5552.46,5555.82, his retreat like you're waiting in a wormhole where you know he's gonna come out of
5557.02,5561.5, yeah that stuff that means for compelling stuff all the all the text stuff the fact that it's like
5561.5,5565.26, it's got like the you know rudimentary version of a black market in it and that the price is actually
5565.26,5570.46, go up that you have inflation based on how you know who's buying crystal line what I mean all
5570.46,5575.58, those things are super interesting to me so yeah that's that's very that's all the civilization
5575.58,5580.78, stuff that aspect so yeah most of the time you you start a battle and then you spend
5581.34,5585.179999999999, 75% of your time not even looking at that battle right going on I just go right about
5585.179999999999,5589.74, you know I don't see how it's doing yeah that was something new because I constantly just clicking
5589.74,5594.3, like okay so what do I do now just take up some more or I just take that what do you do you go
5594.3,5600.54, take up some more take up another planet right and you're like waiting so I was waiting and I was
5600.54,5604.54, looking at it with an RTS mindset I'm like okay we just tacked up for an hour like where's now
5604.54,5608.94, where's our payoff where's the money shot and then we we had a big battle with our capital ships
5608.94,5615.099999999999, and our entire fleet was like that's it press a button but everyone was being nice in that
5615.099999999999,5620.379999999999, game too like oh yeah I understand them in agreement I like this is not how you play and you need
5620.379999999999,5625.9, you don't play one v1 either you I mean it very clearly it's any more than like deftcon you know it's
5625.9,5631.339999999999, like you want to I mean you have these options that the diplomacy menu and saying like let's
5631.339999999999,5635.5, negotiate a ceasefire you could pay someone to quit attacking you like come on dude I'll give you
5635.5,5639.82, some money to stop yeah which is red you can give me like whenever type of resources you want all
5639.82,5644.94, those are like where it's gonna be fun and you're just not gonna get there with two players and thank god
5644.94,5648.86, you can say you probably went over this all last week so don't go over but thank god you can say
5648.86,5653.98, you can play your game yes that is wonderful because yeah they're if you are gonna play a game
5653.98,5658.22, at the scale that you just described yes we're going to actually human beings we if this didn't
5658.22,5664.14, have a good save feature you just be screwed because how you're gonna get 10 people or whatever to
5664.14,5670.9400000000005, commit to like a 48-word block it's really a nice nice thing in the evolution of multi-player
5670.9400000000005,5676.54, games that there's they you could do that now I feel it needs to not be the case at all be Slider
5676.54,5680.38, but I guess more in speed Slider yeah yeah but even in multi-player games there are times
5680.38,5684.38, for but you're simply a player just like I'm not doing anything else there's a speed Slider right
5684.38,5687.900000000001, it would more a very a depth on it has to be yeah very able because you can write it the
5687.900000000001,5692.06, beginning of the game you can pick slow normal or fast right but you're locked into that the whole
5692.700000000001,5696.620000000001, even if you but won't want to save a game okay that's part of the game people could vote like
5696.620000000001,5701.740000000001, a devcon that's exactly yeah yeah that's very good that you play people can vote on because there are
5701.740000000001,5707.34, slow periods where you are watching TV because you're not really doing anything it is waiting for
5707.34,5711.42, something to kick in yeah there's time so now I wanted to play it in the I wanted to play it in a window
5713.02,5717.580000000001, well you can okay I did that you can't we go to option you can Peter we can you want to
5718.22,5722.0599999999995, re the one upwards where you're playing go for it yeah I definitely can't play this game
5722.0599999999995,5726.78, I'm going to start with point it at night though because those part tour like nothing's happening my
5726.78,5731.1, head starts nodding you know like oh like what's your agreeing with the computer?
5731.9,5737.66, yep nope I mean yeah anyway okay and in those walls I tend to just like routinely go through
5737.66,5742.94, everything is everything okay still everything okay still and there's a circle yeah
5743.0199999999995,5748.7, it's a totally complicated emergency facility yeah I tried to overlook that and did you really
5748.7,5753.58, it's something you can rename everything in that game oh my god you're in the back of it oh my god
5753.58,5757.58, that chips right in comment you were in your adventure with this while we were playing that one
5757.58,5761.9, v1 and I was waiting for him when I knew he was coming I went and did a failed attack on his
5761.9,5766.62, system and I retreated to mine and I was like well if he's coming in here he's at least gonna like
5766.62,5771.98, have to stare at some fucked up names which we thought planning so I changed them all yeah they were like
5772.0599999999995,5778.139999999999, yeah they were all wretched names I just went with the lame things if my whole system was just disgusting
5779.74,5784.78, what a surprise okay should we get to the other news item?
5784.78,5794.0599999999995, geez also in in MMO news we had the announcement no it was not an announcement it was merely a
5794.0599999999995,5797.5, confirmation oh my gosh did I not get the website do you have it?
5798.14,5803.66, no but I'm not right where I stole this news item from oh wasn't it the MTV multiplayer
5803.66,5811.58, was MTV multiplayer yeah reported they had an interview with Shane Kim the head of Microsoft Game
5811.58,5819.18, Studios and he confirmed what we mostly knew already which is that the Marvel MMO is now dead and gone
5819.18,5823.5, this is where we see we should have done this while we're not still in the room so I have nothing
5823.5,5830.14, I'd be like okay bye yeah we have to talk comics with him too we saw that's true oh me yeah
5830.14,5837.58, we have to splice in what the hell from Ryan why actually Ryan doesn't like Marvel so much as DC so
5837.58,5846.3, he probably doesn't care yeah so just a card from him Shane Kim told MTV
5846.9400000000005,5852.860000000001, Marvel and we have agreed to end development on the MMO it was an amicable decision it's just
5852.860000000001,5856.62, something that we felt that for us and for them it would be better if we ended development
5858.38,5865.18, and then when they asked what went wrong mr. Kim said I quote I don't think it's necessarily a
5865.18,5869.9800000000005, case of what went wrong I don't think that's the way we had to put it for us we look at our
5869.9800000000005,5875.58, priorities and all of the things we have to do it's a tough space it's a very competitive space
5875.58,5880.38, and it's a space that's changing quite a bit when we first entered development and agreement
5880.38,5884.38, of the development of marvel universe online we thought we would create another subscription based
5884.38,5889.9, MMO and if you really look at the data there's basically one that's successful and everything else
5889.9,5896.7, wouldn't meet our level or definition of commercial success and then you have to look and say can we
5896.7,5902.22, change the development model for that is that really viable given how far we in in development and so forth
5902.22,5909.1, those marvel want to do that there's a whole bunch of factors um so it sounds less and to learn
5909.900000000001,5915.66, considering they at least theoretically learned it with true fantasy life with with true fantasy online
5915.66,5921.740000000001, with uh in the uh methic with what other how did they all say in guard more ended up at at that
5921.740000000001,5927.900000000001, Sony Microsoft's got more more uh aborted MMO host to don't they is probably probably a
5928.219999999999,5934.0599999999995, more but those are had some of them in that the game feature yeah in parritor one another I remember any
5934.0599999999995,5939.5, more I mean yeah it sounds basically like marvel said make us a wow and then Microsoft was like we can't
5940.0599999999995,5946.139999999999, which is smart right so I'll be a good call and the agreement part of the subtext might be
5947.179999999999,5951.98, being a flammout reading too far into it is that maybe Microsoft was willing to say let's look at
5952.0599999999995,5957.66, some alternative business model and go from there right in marvel didn't want to happen with that
5958.379999999999,5962.7, well I think you know his quote there about that there's one successful one and you know all the
5962.7,5967.98, rest don't meet their standards yes yes you know it's pretty right on yeah far into it
5967.98,5974.7, do you want to be the next fourth string MMO to wow you know I mean the marvel license you would think
5974.7,5982.38, would be strong enough to to get over but I have to say personally I've been scoped go along
5982.38,5988.54, of both comic MMO licenses you know I just I don't I don't really get it even when they've
5988.54,5993.98, tried talking to us about it I still don't get it like if I can't be spider manner Batman all right
5993.98,5998.38, then who the fuck is the problem they ran into with Star Wars galaxies just like oh yeah you're a
5998.38,6003.74, chair maker right so then are we all just like minions of spider man you know I just do
6003.74,6008.7, spag man you'll meet I'll give you some quests to go by go find them five at that
6008.7,6012.7, right you actually five of the heroes which is yeah long I'm just spider magic your Rob life
6012.7,6017.18, will make some new characters put some sticks on their backs right well then I might as well play
6017.18,6025.900000000001, three here yeah yeah well right it was cryptic so bike but it's been city for was two basically
6025.9,6031.259999999999, but licensed yeah more or less I would imagine so now I'm shedding any tears Anthony you're
6031.259999999999,6037.339999999999, not I don't it's a rare MMO that you look at and say you know what that's proud of Larry
6037.339999999999,6042.7, floss I mean there's we go right over and over again but I mean it's from guilt over it's time to
6042.7,6047.74, play multiple MMOs I mean yeah well you you found time to play some parts of the burning sea
6047.74,6052.46, barely but yeah and I I'm still not level seven you dabble that takes present
6052.54,6060.14, presidents yeah it's a tough thing too because getting into a new MMO takes getting other people
6060.14,6064.54, into the new MMOs that they have reluctance with your friend group that you normally play with then
6065.34,6068.06, you're just not gonna do it it's just everyone I've una tried it yeah it's so
6068.86,6073.66, it's like tabular rossa came out you know I was like that was fun playing it when we did but then
6073.66,6078.7, when we got the box copy it came out we played it for one evening and then we were just like
6079.58,6085.099999999999, it's a play team fortress too uh but here's stuff you know but why is that do you think and it's
6085.099999999999,6088.78, weird it couldn't entertain me for more than a week why did they make these games are supposed
6088.78,6092.78, to entertain you for like a lifetime and and I say a lifetime because like with you know
6092.78,6097.9, with a lot of the rings they saw the lifetime subscription right if you think you're gonna be playing
6097.9,6102.54, that she five years from now let alone and it's still people that are playing it while it's going
6102.54,6108.62, to be four years and you know yeah this fall so I'd like to think all of the personality types
6108.62,6114.38, who are into this already have their game of choice so it's gonna be harder right but they've
6114.38,6118.78, said that before right they said that before with everquest when that came out and that had a
6118.78,6123.18, couple hundred thousand subscribers you know the common wisdom was like well okay we've now
6123.18,6128.3, nabbed any loser who would spend this much time playing one game and then while came around and
6128.3,6132.38, got that many more people in right so maybe there's another step maybe there's another level
6133.18,6137.74, if you on to wow's ten million that's true that will get a hundred million people playing
6137.74,6141.58, everyone always promises to do something different with a two we want to look back on it and
6141.58,6146.3, of all the mm of dabble then they're really all the same and yeah I'm looking at like the
6146.3,6150.86, differences are really like negligible super hard of it's just the nature of that kind of game
6150.86,6155.58, and it's like and it's just how do you make a game that has something for people to do
6155.58,6159.66, indefinitely and that's not gonna take us and they're definitely in a amount of time to create content
6159.66,6164.0599999999995, for yeah and it all comes back to the fucking grind and it's like yeah that's right and I look
6164.0599999999995,6169.099999999999, out at the upcoming ones you know the ages of Conan's and all those other ones on the future and
6169.099999999999,6174.46, and I don't see anything that's newer different about any of them yet yeah like some of these are
6174.46,6179.34, like years and development still and you know I was just different that's not really but that's
6179.34,6183.66, what there are different ones it's like e-von line and stuff that's why that is like kind of more
6183.66,6186.78, inner I like hearing about that more than when I look at that was like that though
6187.74,6191.5, last thing about it but for the people who are into that right that that's a whole different
6191.5,6195.82, model than wow yeah it seems that seems like it's entirely different for me then the experience that we
6195.82,6201.9, go in and we're just gonna beat up on some shit so we can get something to beat up on because that's
6201.9,6208.38, why I had the laugh went and I like low-trial a lot I still like it but you know when I first went
6208.38,6213.099999999999, in there and there were lots of players in there who were like well I never would play wow you know
6213.1,6217.820000000001, that that's kind of a baby game the low-trial here this is this is serious and I was like
6218.860000000001,6223.9800000000005, sorry this is wow with a low-trial skin what are you talking about you know but you get people
6223.9800000000005,6229.18, thinking like well I'm playing a different mechanic here I tried to find it before it's been
6229.18,6233.820000000001, a while kind of retired here the with here is a web for a little bit but I had something that I wanted
6233.820000000001,6238.54, to bring in the read and I I don't have it but I can tell the story of Anthony's heard it
6239.18,6244.78, the guys that we play there's no like feces or anything or dick so don't worry if you're out there listening
6245.58,6250.3, they're all turning like we've had that cover already today we've covered those characters
6250.3,6256.54, but they just they're playing Lord of the Rings online and they basically go around looking for
6256.54,6262.54, GM's to grief and they find the GM's and they figure out that this is probably someone in India and
6262.54,6266.78, they're just they're not they don't play this game or really know the game they got the manual
6266.86,6270.86, and they look at my questions and are they looking their database and someone types this and they're
6270.86,6275.82, able to pull up a page and just read it right it's like singular cell phone tell text about something
6275.82,6281.58, so they just live to like drive those guys crazy and they find them and then they start asking
6281.58,6286.46, them all these questions and they know to like sprinkle in a few words now and then that will pull
6286.46,6291.5, up something to make them think they found it but really they're talking about Star Trek so like
6292.46,6296.54, somebody's shit they're saying I don't know eventually got so elaborate he was like I'm telling
6296.54,6304.3, Jordy to engage engage the warp but he wasn't engaged the warp and they're like I understand that
6304.3,6310.78, your warp is broken I'm sorry that this is a disservice to you sorry for the inconvenience
6310.78,6315.26, because like warp would come in or something you know and then just get going and go in and so I'll have
6315.26,6319.58, to get this greed they have they have them saved from their like it's just all text based you know
6319.58,6327.18, you see in the window down at the bottom so we're now talking about dilatium crystals that's a great idea
6328.38,6333.26, it's good even your board it's better than grinding that's a merchant gameplay
6336.0599999999995,6340.78, so real life interaction that these are my most promote anything else on our agenda there
6340.78,6345.5, or show we call we had a podcast let's do some quick we're gonna put this off but we have like
6345.5,6352.06, this big topic oh yeah we did the big topic that we wanted it to go we want to that but at least
6352.06,6357.34, like I wanted to talk about let's talk about some off topic shit real quick Chris wear
6358.14,6365.02, ah yes lost episode 2 and we gotta wait for that Ryan he's not a resident okay let me say this
6365.02,6370.38, then okay the fucking egon with the dust devil acto pack or whatever it was
6371.34,6377.26, had a ghostbuster yeah that shit was stupid and it like that guy that shit was dumb it was
6377.26,6382.14, kind of dumb the dumbest thing you know it didn't even strike me as dumb it just struck me it was like
6382.14,6389.26, a like that flat like you're trying to be weird and I don't care that's how I reacted to it
6389.26,6395.58, also that was a pretty low rent ghostbuster no it was like it was like a fucking black just
6395.58,6400.78, no bar yes that's a very black and decar thing with like a spinning contraption on the bottom
6400.78,6404.54, yeah I wanted to like they ran out of a budget for that first I thought it was like that's
6404.54,6408.14, what you came up with that first it was just you know that's his hookster equipment right he was
6408.14,6413.18, another con just like all right like so yeah and then they're like oh no he's really doing this
6413.18,6417.1, and this is really helping him he's dead people like I could deal with it on the island with all
6417.1,6422.46, the shenanigans and the fucking cabin with Vincent and the rocking chair that's okay it's been
6422.54,6429.1, the dog way but for for some reason I'm even I'm even able to smile at little things we're like you see
6429.74,6435.1, that same guy miles and he's he's faking that he was you know unconscious or something and he
6435.1,6439.82, got to read you know right from the helicopter and then jack a back doctor runs up and the first thing
6439.82,6444.38, he does is yanks the helmet off it's like I could deal with that that's dumb or the fact that
6444.38,6448.38, they're parachuting from a helicopter well still I got because don't have parachute they didn't
6448.38,6452.14, at low altitude like that which is already it's like that's fine but it was the black and
6452.14,6456.46, decker that did it for me I don't even care that guys saw dead people the fact that he had the
6456.46,6461.26, fucking have the like yeah they didn't really need the machine he could have just come in and sat down
6461.26,6466.62, on the bed and maybe it was just there to like drown out the noise he was making a white noise
6466.62,6472.9400000000005, thing it's just you wouldn't hear him back I don't know who cares oh that's that's probably
6472.94,6477.5, Ryan's because Ryan is like the biggest apologies for anything and everything yeah oh hell yeah
6477.5,6482.0599999999995, you can't you can't say negative worry about that sure I'll be like what the hell
6484.379999999999,6489.0199999999995, did you see did you see did you see it's fun though I wish I could get that in this yes I
6489.0199999999995,6496.379999999999, got this stupidness I can't though I kind of can't I don't know it's it's I'm very much along for the
6496.379999999999,6502.54, ride yeah I I I it lost to me is contained within the hour that it is on television and then
6502.54,6508.14, apparently in these podcasts when we discuss it right I can't get them bored and read stuff about it
6508.14,6515.34, it beats 24 which is I know I shouldn't have been trying to watch 24 when I need to get wire
6515.34,6521.1, the wire yes but it was like I happened to have had the 24 season one set in my house that's
6521.1,6527.66, so alone me forever and ever and ever and I like put that on and it reminded me of like hey as
6527.66,6534.0599999999995, bad as lost can seem it's a hell a lot better than this that that was a ridiculous show I
6534.0599999999995,6538.94, two episodes in that was enough for me it was like an after school special you know that shit
6538.94,6543.5, like it would make you watch sure of course right you watch after school it's like telling you
6543.5,6547.42, about like sure don't don't try and don't smoke pot because you're gonna end up like a
6547.42,6551.66, hair when feeding the next week it was like that you know there's like this girls that get up
6551.66,6558.22, ducted jack's daughter gets abducted it was not doesn't it jack bar you think this is the
6558.22,6562.94, ludicrous one you you need to watch it later seasons well look how can you get worse than this okay so
6562.94,6567.98, his daughter's get abducted no well first they go and it's like oh older boys and then the older
6567.98,6573.099999999999, boys like fucking slip and roofies and they're just like you got you know they won't let them go home
6573.099999999999,6577.0199999999995, and then it turns to fall on but I want them I stopped watching it was just going in the background
6577.1,6581.1, next thing I know one of them got run over by car and it's got a broken arm and then she's back
6581.1,6586.06, in like the petto van and then the guys like here all help the pain and then he's like shooting her
6586.06,6591.42, up with heroin to ease the pain and then like the girls parents are out looking for them and they're
6591.42,6595.820000000001, like pulled over on the side of the road by cop and then the same petto van just right by there it
6595.820000000001,6602.22, goes I promise you you are not at the ludicrous parts of 24 you really aren't it gets so much worse
6602.22,6607.02, what about the chick who who has somehow gets this high-tech bomb on a commercial airliner she's
6607.02,6612.780000000001," flying at 30,000 feet has no mask or like no suit to deal with the fact that it's like freezing you"
6612.780000000001,6618.22, know below freezing temperatures and then blows herself off the tour before blowing up the entire
6618.22,6623.26, plane and you're gonna start to like dead people coming back you're gonna see you know every
6623.26,6628.3, stupid ass thing you could possibly dead people coming back well essentially yeah or former bad
6628.3,6633.1, guys are now good guys and former good guys are now bad guys every every lame twist that can
6633.1,6638.78, possibly happen what happened it's basically it's it's like a roadrunner cartoon every it is
6638.78,6643.26, it's kind of like he thought he's run you know he runs until he he's like off the cliff and
6643.26,6647.820000000001, doesn't realize he's off the cliff and then he looks down and then he falls so you know something
6647.820000000001,6652.38, stupid happens to jack bow every week and then it's a sad if it's the next well in the very first
6652.38,6656.9400000000005, episode he shoots he's an FBI or whatever he shoots his fucking station chief in the the leg with
6656.94,6663.339999999999, like an elephant tranquilizer dart in his office right and then when he wakes up a lot of people
6663.339999999999,6669.259999999999, going forward and then it's like then the next episode they're all chill again but yeah yeah okay so
6669.9,6674.219999999999, never watch that show so that's just a warning it's gonna have it to pause just it will write
6674.219999999999,6679.98, in and hate us for discing it yeah tell me about runfall too send me some videos from google
6679.98,6689.339999999999, video about the gold standard okay where else are we at here so we wrap up Sean and I wanted to
6689.339999999999,6697.099999999999, I recently pushed the work of Chris wear on him and we need to convince you guys to become lovers
6697.099999999999,6705.58, yes what does he do right he's a you love a graphic novelist I didn't enough at the store
6706.22,6711.42, I guess he comes from like the you know Daniel plows if you're gonna have to like pick peers
6711.42,6717.1, that I'm you might be familiar with like the Daniel clouds kind of modern life but like the sad
6717.1,6722.38, dark side of it well I'm not date ball yeah so if it's got any relation to that kind of thing
6722.38,6728.94, it's darkly humorous but it's mostly like sad and in ways that are it just intensely familiar to you
6730.38,6735.1, even if like I mean these are like it's about like the saddest sex in the universe in my sad I mean either
6735.82,6743.1, like just pieces of crap or just clinically depressed kind of people like you know you you feel bad
6743.1,6747.26, for them and it's not you don't necessarily think it's their fault the things are going this way you think
6748.0599999999995,6752.94, someone else built them up this way they're selling this thing yeah no I know
6753.74,6758.0599999999995, well they've just given you a fair warning because like yeah more guys it's funny here this
6758.0599999999995,6762.94, interesting like yeah it's going on here like you know you're take on it because well the the first
6762.94,6769.98, one you gave me was rusty brown so he's got one arc that for a equine novelty library that's
6769.98,6774.78, name of the series um called Jimmy Carg and we did earlier which is a I don't know how many
6774.78,6779.259999999999, quote issues it was but you can be a big hard cover it's like 15 of them but the one I read first
6779.259999999999,6785.259999999999, was the one after that um which is called rusty brown it was just like three issues total so far
6785.259999999999,6789.58, yeah that remember basically he self published some in hard cover format for the individual
6789.66,6793.98, issues but there's a lot there they're basically like many graphic novels and he's been getting
6793.98,6801.9, those out at a pace about one per year so there it's three into its uh 17 and up or 16 and up was it
6801.9,6807.0199999999995, is that one it's yeah 16 17 and 18 are out now and that's for the new story arc so it's totally
6807.0199999999995,6812.3, self contained you could pick it up um you can get it on Amazon like a local comic shop if it's decent
6812.38,6820.3, but um yeah each other the books are beautiful like each one is totally constructed differently
6820.3,6824.46, like they have different we know cover each different stock different gimmicks to them yeah
6825.5,6830.54, the okay uh so he gets a way I was just thinking about it was like you know because it is
6830.54,6834.78, ultimately so depressing there's like almost never any light at the end of the tunnel at least
6834.78,6840.3, for the principal characters in the story right but there there's lights in the world though
6841.02,6847.02, yeah and and I was thinking it's not necessarily I like it's kind of a good it's not like
6847.02,6852.22, a not only happy when it rains type of like reason to like the book i mean in the same way
6852.22,6857.26, that I like I don't know you've seen you know welcome to the dollhouse that guy's like movies that
6857.26,6861.02, came after that I think you know like happiness stuff are a little too much like okay this is just
6861.02,6865.58, to move about fucked up people in the fucked up world right or like the worst case scenario it's not
6865.58,6871.18, like this at all but uh recon4 dream it's just like uh no i thought it's not slick you're is too
6871.18,6874.62, yeah it's not like that at all like welcome to dollhouse there's there's enough there where
6875.42,6879.82, you care for the people and but it's always like you can really laugh too right you're able to
6879.82,6885.0199999999995, laugh you and her stuff there's their humor in this for sure but but not slapstick not like uh
6885.82,6890.22, like you know the polian dynamite type stuff i mean that's not like just like juxtaposition of
6890.38,6896.780000000001, bizarre images that just like did it make it laugh because they're kind of saturday around like
6896.780000000001,6902.22, the the reason i like it though is because it's not just like if you for for one like Chris
6902.22,6907.34, where is just like the consummate graphic novelist i think in my mind i mean there are a few others
6907.34,6914.06, but he he's like the presentation of his books is just incredible there's nothing at all like it at all right
6914.06,6919.18, now there's there's my one that doesn't anything like it and so rather than so and just presenting you know
6919.26,6924.700000000001, like a mediocre artist or even a b-level artist just drawing just illustrating stories about
6924.700000000001,6931.02, about people and their their day-to-day you know trials and stuff um he's communicating a majority of
6931.02,6936.62, his message through the actual layouts and selves through you know his compositional techniques
6937.34,6943.34, and there's like a play with the medium there that is like it's crazy that it's taken this long
6943.34,6947.26, when you look at it you're like wow i mean there's all the way back to winter decay and some of
6947.34,6951.820000000001, the earliest you know guys and he's really more inspired by that you can tell he he's more you know
6952.62,6957.9800000000005, interesting stuff like that than anything contemporary at all but you look at it like how is
6957.9800000000005,6962.860000000001, it's crazy that it's taken that let's almost taken 100 years for the the format for people to do
6962.860000000001,6967.74, the things that he's doing in the four minutes some of them i mean they do go back to the mccare
6967.74,6973.1, i think were like he might have an entire page and it will be divided into a number of panels and
6973.740000000001,6980.780000000001, um basically it's a it depicts a single scene but each panel is some different point in time
6980.780000000001,6985.58, it might not even be like chronological right but so you're still seeing you're getting a sense of
6985.58,6989.1, movement and stuff so it's a panel school vibe but it's not though it's not just a traditional
6989.1,6993.26, where the character is walking through a static environment and the dialogue changing i mean they'll
6993.26,6997.660000000001, be like they could be years and years apart there might be a hundred years apart in the pictures but
6997.660000000001,7002.22, you basically can take in the entire page at a single glance and on that level it's communicating
7002.3,7007.26, something to you about time and about place and all this stuff and then inside of it there's like
7007.26,7013.900000000001, stories within that um you'll i mean just kind of like family circus it is like family circus
7013.900000000001,7018.780000000001, exactly other tricks he has will be you'll look at the entire you'll look at the entire page or you'll
7018.780000000001,7023.66, start reading and some place on the page and as you're going through it you're like you're turning
7023.66,7030.06, the book this way in that way because he'll create this giant diagram of like interconnectivity between
7030.22,7034.14, the various figures and stuff at the page and it's still man just to tell stories so you might see
7034.54,7038.700000000001, you know someone's walking and then there's an instead of like his wallet and then there's a
7038.700000000001,7042.38, picture and his wallet and then that goes into a drawer and then the drawer is placed in a house and
7042.38,7046.38, another point of time it was hospital and that comes out and it right and the picture you're
7046.38,7050.38, like you're like two two two like two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two uh two
7050.38,7055.1, go back to his parents and then again it's able to show you like and obviously it's
7055.1,7060.22, completely wordlessly like those house the house drawings you know that I think you're probably
7060.22,7065.9800000000005, referring to he has big spreads you just kind of turn the book vertically and there's this three
7065.9800000000005,7069.9800000000005, story house and it kind of tells the stories of each of the characters living there in different
7069.9800000000005,7074.3, points of time by like you know pointing like you said like maybe something under the floorboards
7074.3,7079.02, that the person left there before so it'll kind of do a little pointer to a box telling that little
7079.02,7085.580000000001, story and then maybe they left something in the garden that someone in the present found and
7085.580000000001,7089.42, his hang out in the wall and it's complicated. And he looked at him at first you're like what the hell
7089.42,7094.14, is this and you stare at him for I don't know good 10 minutes like just getting these stories of
7094.14,7098.780000000001, these people out of it and like I said it's completely wordless but sometimes you still learn a lot
7098.780000000001,7103.26, about these people. The building he gives the building you know gives the building the character
7103.26,7107.02, that way like that those specific building stories that series in the back of the book
7107.1,7111.26, it'll like there'll be on one page then you'll skip a page and there won't be one and then there's another one
7111.820000000001,7115.900000000001, another like installment it's the same house the layouts exactly the same but it's like a big
7115.900000000001,7121.18, jump in time yep so then you can flip back and forth between these and you see the lives how the
7121.18,7126.14, lives have changed between them each page on its own tells a story between the tenants like on each floor
7126.14,7129.26, and the way that they're connecting with one another or they're not connecting because like you
7129.26,7135.660000000001, know what was it wings of a dover whatever the movie um and you know so there's relations on that level
7135.74,7139.34, you can go back and forth in the time and you see the building kind of has a character but the other
7139.34,7145.42, thing is as you're going through these you might end up uh he's he's so expertly leading your eye
7145.42,7150.38, around the page both with the story and not just a traditional you start comics on the top left and
7150.38,7155.74, you work your way scan it basically like text you end up somewhere on the page and there's like the
7155.74,7161.5, equivalent of you know boom here's this big important piece of this puzzle on this page and it was
7161.58,7165.66, a front of you the whole time but you didn't notice it like there's one and there's like this little
7165.66,7171.26, there's like a underground there's a coffin with the what but if you just look you're like there's
7171.26,7174.54, this coffin there but as you go through it and you read it and he takes you there you didn't even you
7174.54,7178.94, didn't even notice it and then you end up and you're like oh that's the character yeah that's the end
7179.58,7185.98, you know it's like so many just like fantastic things like that it's sense of space is unlike I can't even
7185.98,7191.1, imagine coming up with some of the stuff it does you so careful and precise about all of his building
7191.1,7194.620000000001, layouts like even like not in these building story you're talking about the layout of the school and
7194.620000000001,7200.700000000001, rusty brown yeah every everything is mapped out extremely carefully um in that particular story
7200.700000000001,7207.9800000000005, he goes so far as to if that one's got the main stories kind of on the top of the page and at the
7207.9800000000005,7212.46, bottom there's these little this little strip of some other characters going about their lives and
7212.46,7216.22, and at first you're like how are these people connected the selling suit separate stories
7216.780000000001,7221.9800000000005, about halfway through it dawns on you that the panels almost have a one-to-one correlation
7221.9800000000005,7226.3, in terms of like what you're looking at like if someone's walking through a door in one panel
7226.3,7230.860000000001, on the top the other set of characters are walking through a door too and eventually it all
7230.860000000001,7234.860000000001, converges in the one place and like sometimes you're seeing things from the opposite angle on the bottom
7234.860000000001,7238.9400000000005, right around the top and it's just wow when when you realize those kind of things just like oh my god
7238.9400000000005,7243.5, I can't believe that it's been he's been doing this this whole book and just kind of flooring right
7244.14,7247.18, yeah that's the best thing and you look back and like oh great it's kind of like you know the
7247.18,7252.38, great moments when you're watching you know momentum or something and then you're like ah let's go back
7252.38,7256.78, and actually see how well this puzzle is constructed now that I'm aware of what the puzzle
7256.78,7261.26, supposed to what the solution supposed to be this was actually what I was raving to about with the wire
7261.26,7267.82, that they've got you know this five season uh story arc that's been building over the years
7267.82,7272.78, and that now that there's the fifth season and it's been so carefully controlled by a writer with
7272.94,7278.94, utterly brilliant grasp of his characters and of the story he wanted to tell that he's able to
7278.94,7283.82, you're able to realize now that things that seemed a little random or whatever in season two
7284.3,7290.139999999999, are now paying off in season five but he was so patient with his story telling that he was able to wait
7290.139999999999,7295.179999999999, three years right and just if you were if you're and I I don't even pick these things up
7295.179999999999,7300.0599999999995, except I'm reading off the web it's like from more diligent you know people are people who have
7300.14,7306.14, watched the episodes 18 times in a row you know that he's put it in there as a reward for those who have
7306.14,7312.54, carefully followed but you can appreciate it on its own on one level as it is. Sounds right a bit like this
7312.54,7316.620000000001, and then going back to loss that's one thing I don't get from that show. Does it rise to be
7316.620000000001,7321.02, seen yeah like if you if they can get those from it and it was all it does when they're right now I'm
7321.02,7326.22, not feeling it and then it can go back and then even mediocre episodes could become like yeah sure
7326.22,7330.14, interesting I think they bang it's over the heads with things that are ultimately unimportant I
7330.14,7334.54, think that might be a lot of right here and that shows legacy but we'll see yeah. So what's the name of
7334.54,7340.14, this writer again for people who is this is where the books that are the books are acne novelty
7340.14,7345.42, library but you get the first questions called Jimmy Corgan the smartest kid on earth and
7346.14,7351.5, definitely recommend all of his stuff but to continue on that thought aside from like any kind of a
7351.5,7357.58, gimmick or anything just the way he handles space works for me in other ways as well and
7357.58,7362.22, it's like although he uses this flattened sort of elongated perspective that you would see doesn't
7362.22,7368.22, sort of communicate a great deal of depth when you're looking at things you always get a very
7368.86,7374.22, like really well it's almost like an isometric thing. This is a huge perspective very much so you know
7375.18,7383.18, print tradition but he he always has a very perfect sense of what the world is and where things are
7383.18,7389.5, placed and how people move through them and that that's like a very basic thing but the majority of
7389.5,7394.38, people who illustrate comic books are do pay no attention to it whatsoever so what you see in the
7394.38,7399.820000000001, shittiest of comic books and looking at the superhero ones it's just runs rampant because the
7399.82,7404.62, illustrators there essentially wanted to draw people flexing and posing and stuff so they just do it
7404.62,7409.66, and then the background doesn't matter and then paneled a panel there's no real sense of continuity
7409.66,7413.9, that he throw his right fist and did it hit the sky here and then did it not come back into the
7413.9,7418.78, trash can that we know is in the salivacus three panels ago and every subsequent panel we've seen it
7418.78,7423.5, in space exactly where it ought to be and that's another thing why you know ultimately some
7423.66,7430.78, the first stop books by hitch and malar were were so good is because like hitch is perfect at that
7430.78,7434.54, he completely tracks all that and then when there's actually a fight which is ultimately
7435.1,7438.94, could be the worst thing in a comic book ever because if it just is a bunch of people grit in their
7438.94,7443.42, teeth and flexing it actually seemed as though there's some choreography there where it's now the
7443.42,7448.62, new ultimate is exactly that the guy Joe Maddie's doing it is just complete hack and the writers
7448.7,7456.86, and idiot so there what the so that's garbage but so what Chris where you so good at it
7456.86,7461.5, as you're moving through the story walking through a school so instead these grand environments
7461.5,7465.98, and stuff they're just they're very normal they're very you know quote-tating into drop a word
7467.099999999999,7472.62, and it takes you back like the one in the school it's set in like an elementary school it's like
7472.62,7476.46, a junior high it's like a boat you know it's got both and the kids all one of the the kids older
7476.54,7481.9800000000005, sisters and the junior high part of it and the book is presented in this lavish hardcover that
7481.9800000000005,7487.02, looks like something you would maybe get when you're in junior high it's all embossed and stuff and
7487.02,7490.7, it's got like it looks like a yearbook it's got you know when you're signing your name when you get
7490.7,7496.46, the book that year it's all presented like that and you're going through the school it's just
7496.46,7501.02, really transports you you're like oh god I remember all these things to the way that they have like the
7501.900000000001,7507.1, inflatable letters and stuff over it and the alphabet the school launches and the capteories and
7507.1,7513.02, everything it's like it's just you for for some reason when I read his books it was entirely engrossed
7513.02,7517.900000000001, in the mercy of the world I think that's why it was so like I was saying to me before depressing to
7517.900000000001,7523.740000000001, me because it just hit so close to home in so many levels I mean ultimately I hope I am not as
7524.9400000000005,7529.580000000001, messed up with some of these people in here but I recognize certain certain traits and I'm like oh man
7529.82,7535.58, yeah that was kind of me and that was kind of the room that happened and he's kind of yeah he's like
7535.58,7542.86, his the book will close you mentioned art chrome all these guys are kind of like self-loaters
7542.86,7549.58, yeah right and he's definitely got that going if you look in in the the new volumes the art teacher is
7549.58,7555.58, actually him oh really I don't know if it's supposed to be him in every single way okay I mean
7555.58,7560.3, obviously well yeah it's clearly not because he didn't teach elementary or junior high art
7560.3,7566.3, art school but the physical likeness is exactly him that's interesting and he if you look at it
7566.3,7572.14, matches up because he dropped out of art school that it was a total farce and it kind of comes through
7572.14,7577.26, and on to become the the guy he is now a few other things about him to finish up is that he's uh
7577.66,7582.38, it's incredible to me that he's so it seems like he's so underred very few people even know that
7582.38,7588.7, it exists but he he makes the rounds among a certain group of people and that he's uh
7588.7,7593.02, he's friends with chip kid who's one of the the countries you know the world's most famous
7593.02,7600.3, sub book jacket designers he does covers for New Yorker periodically he'll design jacket saw you
7600.3,7605.900000000001, know sweetie's literary journal right he did a uh addition for them edited that right when I was reading
7605.900000000001,7609.900000000001, that Michael Shabun book you were asking me if it was that was a Chris wear yeah if I'm really
7609.9,7614.299999999999, like the typeface and everything yeah treats his own typeface isn't I mean every single thing in
7614.299999999999,7620.299999999999, his book is like all coming from him and that seemed inspired by him another thing is like he's
7620.299999999999,7625.0199999999995, uh I or glass from NPR he's friends with him and they didn't animated version of a thing
7625.0199999999995,7630.379999999999, all building stories also in a program but yeah he'll he'll be remembered I think along
7630.379999999999,7638.379999999999, at when when all the Joe Mads and stuff for uh forgot oh god good stuff that's our recommendation this week
