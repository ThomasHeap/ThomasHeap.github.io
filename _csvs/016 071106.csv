60.72,67.44, Alius yeah my handle. I was a part of war on game pro part of war again. I was going to say Dingo wasn't dignified

81.44,85.6, Ryan and Darren and me and we're here and we're sorry we haven't been around for a couple weeks
85.68,88.0, We tried two weeks ago dinner week
88.16,92.72, We were actually sitting here with our headphones on ready to record even have a special guest
92.72,97.6, We had a special guest from Blizzard or ex from Blizzard actually not not Blizzard anymore
98.16,101.03999999999999, But the equipment failed us and then last week
102.0,107.2," Well last week we were just lame last week's our fault. Yeah, well in normal time we were gone"
107.2,113.60000000000001," Because the holiday all right, I blame our forefathers. It was their fault everything for freeing us from England"
115.2,120.64000000000001," Okay, so we're here. We'll we're sorry. We'll stay here. We'll keep recording regularly"
121.28,125.2," And now that we've had two weeks ago, but that means we have a lot to talk about don't we?"
126.48,128.48000000000002, We sure do
129.04,133.44, Sean slash scene was on vacation and then I was in Germany
134.56,137.67999999999998," For the cover story we're working on now right, so"
138.79999999999998,142.39999999999998," That's well, I guess like I said it's game time. I was playing crisis"
142.95999999999998,144.95999999999998, But not so much time to be playing you know
145.51999999999998,149.28," Playing games here. Yeah, I didn't touch a computer while I was gone great you guys are you"
149.28,154.32, I know I blame all you should detect so we come back after two weeks and you you come on to say you haven't been playing games
154.88,156.88," Well, that's it that next week. I did"
156.96,161.92," Okay, and what did you play the following week? That's what I downloaded the parade demo"
162.48,163.76, Wow
163.76,165.76, See now we're talking and
166.4,169.92," I liked it. I mean, there was I had no expectations whatsoever for it"
170.32,177.28," Yeah, but the portal stuff was cool and the anti-gravity stuff was cool and gonna be very interesting to see how this game does"
177.44,180.64," Yeah, it was like there was three thing they had the spirit walking. It was all like"
181.04,184.8," Yeah, things that were like hey, these are kind of things that haven't really seen in first person shooters"
185.76000000000002,188.8," Right, but what I want to know is see that this stuff exists"
189.52,193.04000000000002, Way back in the original design of this game like if prey had come out in
193.76000000000002,196.24, 1998 would have had the spirit walking and the
197.04000000000002,202.56, The portal stuff or it was the psych all response to newer FPSs. Well the portal stuff the portal stuff was there obviously
202.56,207.68, That was the big deal right at the first time or I think like the spirit walking on stuff was kind of like when they reinvented the game
208.72000000000003,210.72000000000003, When human head was short of work on it. Yeah
211.35999999999999,216.64," And I don't I mean, I play through the whole game and I actually I mean the single player game. I enjoy it"
216.64,220.88," I mean it's it's kind of you know, it's a little cliche it pulls off the whole like you know the heroes journey the"
220.88,227.6," Right, you know rise to power of so let's interrupt quickly to talk about that just just my favorite part is that in the demo you start off"
227.92,229.92," Yeah, let's get in there. Yeah"
230.32,232.32, Grandpa's messages
232.32,235.52," That's a bee you know, we need to be you know, we need to be true to our culture and our heritage"
235.92,237.92, So you look around you
237.92,242.55999999999997, We got Judas priests on the jukebox you've got gambling machines. You know
243.11999999999998,246.07999999999998, The first thing grandpa does and then the first and then grandpa's
246.56,247.83999999999997, Sweet and firewater
247.83999999999997,250.64," Yes, he said monishing you and then you grab a wrench here"
252.32,260.24," Yeah, I mean, so what we're referring to if you haven't seen this is the the protagonist of the game is an is a native American"
260.8,262.8, That's right. Is it a zombie hawk?
263.76,265.76," No, it's"
265.76,269.76, The delicious pun isn't it Tommy Tobody and Tobody is Cherokee for Hawk
270.56,272.56, Well pretty much
272.56,274.56, So that's so
274.56,279.03999999999996, His name is Tommy Hawk but at least you'll be your coincidence exactly they make you work for it now though
280.24,286.08, Work for the racism the hard part is that said like that's actually a cool scene when you're starting off the game and you're like
287.12,289.36," You're like first you know, all right grandpa's drink a firewater"
289.36,293.92," Do this pre-selling the jukebox and I'm playing you know, I'm playing whatever five-guard draw on"
293.92,297.6," Yeah, I'm like wait a minute. I'm playing five-guard draw on a shooter"
297.92,302.48, I got you just pre-se you know hearts are next and I'm drank a grandfathers drinking firewater
302.96000000000004,304.96000000000004, Like I don't know if this is what I can't get in their life
305.84000000000003,308.64000000000004, So it's not it is a stereotype it's actually a good time
309.12,311.12, It's kind of a good time
311.12,314.72, I was rackin up the score on Roonman. It's a really odd way to start the game
314.72,319.44, It is the first 60 seconds of the game where you encounter all this stuff and it just I was playing it going
320.08,325.6," Do I want to play this any further? This is already kind of a lot. Yeah, I mean, you know, and that's"
326.08,328.08, Intention is later aside and what they may have done
328.88,334.96, Like with the character eventually in the game. That's the first 60 seconds in the game right and if you're at all sensitive to that kind of stuff
334.96,339.84," I don't know if I was extra sensitive that day, but my head I was like I can't believe Grandpa just walked over and got a drink"
340.64,347.36," Yes, did they establish some context helps make the otherworldly stuff seem all the more otherworldly because if you just started off"
347.84000000000003,349.36, Like in the series of you have a duchin
349.92,354.56," I mean, you'd be like oh, here's quite far again because you know, rightly it's guys on the"
355.12,360.72, But then think of the million different ways. I could have started it it could have been on regular old earth for the first
361.2,365.76," Five minutes, but he could have been anywhere he could have been sitting at a diner with a cheeseburger"
365.76,368.72," You know, he didn't have to be in a bar with gambling machines"
369.52000000000004,376.0," And it's all stuff that like they had how long ten years they were gonna? Yeah, I mean he could have been on a bookstore reading purses"
376.0,381.84," He could have asked you know, it's true. You know, and his name didn't have to be Tommy Hawk, you know"
383.2,388.16, So they made some weird kind of weird decision their entry barriers. I call them
388.56,392.64," Yeah, but after that it's you know, once you get yeah the other entry barriers"
392.64,398.68, They it does seem a media that like click for because you're like hey people are getting strong right the people right
398.68,402.24," That's kind of a weird thing, but then once you start getting into the game play mechanics"
402.24,403.6, That's what it started to make right
403.6,409.36," Yeah, maybe I do want this and the people over two was also as a combination of of both of the the"
409.36,414.16," Quake four people who were stuff and then also from half life too, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
414.16,419.16," So elaborate, weren't you asking like the ultimate end is to like basically run like a spike through someone's chest"
419.16,424.72," But like instead they give you a good, you know two miles of track like it's cedar point and so right years something"
424.72,427.36," You know, yeah, I mean those are following these"
427.36,433.84000000000003, Following these people who are these poor humans who have been a you know captured by the aliens and they're going along this conveyor belt
434.40000000000003,439.24, And you're winding your way through this entire level it gets to the end and they just get like a spike through
439.24,440.44," Yeah, you know"
440.44,444.08000000000004, Why did they just put a bolt in the first second? Why did they have to yeah
444.08000000000004,448.48," Mind them all right because that conveyor belt must have been expensive for them the foot in their spaceship, you know"
448.48,454.76, It was a humanitarian end because it was like instead of cruel and unusual punishment you get Mr. Toys wild ride and then
455.71999999999997,460.08, So it's kind of like a train ride in the world war two in Nazi Germany
461.76,462.76, So I'm sorry
465.76,470.4," That's actually like something that that Kroll was the same on his show the other day, but we won't go there"
470.4,472.4," Yeah, my I need to bleep that out"
473.03999999999996,476.92, Well work on that they got it's not funny about seven minutes and 30 seconds
477.92,479.92," Okay, remember that mark that"
479.92,482.92," So yeah, anyway, so if you just heard a curious"
482.92,488.56, Erasure sound or whatever you're listening. That's why that's my Holocaust joke
488.92,493.52000000000004," Yeah, because it sits but in general, so we're all sort of like in pride despite the sort of yeah"
493.52000000000004,499.6, Once vaguely racist opening second. I'm dear lucky I continued to play it because it was cool
499.6,505.92, After I got past like my mental block with it that whole ashore like first level that is amazing. I thought you know
505.92,512.2, I really hadn't played anything like that that kind of anti-gravity stuff there in can answers if that stays fresh
512.2,519.84, If they do enough if they iterate enough on it so that it's not like because I mean imagine if you're doing that for six hours and not not twisting it
519.84,524.24, It's gonna it's obviously it's a gimmick they play with in different degrees
524.24,530.4000000000001, There's like these targets you hit and when you hit them a change it reorings the gravity of a room you're in right
530.4000000000001,534.84," So you're on that error so that you're sitting the wall that you shot is now the floor, but does that stay"
534.84,535.84," That's yeah, that's yeah"
535.84,538.72," Yeah, you know, but the things like they take advantage of it in different ways later on"
538.72,542.52," So yeah, I mean like you'll be walking you'll be walking on a platform and these guys"
542.52,546.08," Material is dematerialized and it'll appear on the wall, but it'll be like they're ground"
546.64,551.08," Right, so you're kind of like throw a grenade and it all sorts shifts to the right"
551.36,557.4, through enemies and now allegedly it's their their natural environment to they utilize it in clever ways
557.4,562.4, They do utilize it in some basic ways. I mean I haven't seen like some some seriously crazy cool stuff
562.4,565.2, But like they are a self aware of like oh
565.44,568.6800000000001, Like I'm about to die so like they'll run they'll they'll double back
568.6800000000001,572.84, They'll actually run to the same health spawns that you would go to and I'll grab the health before you can
572.84,576.0, What about like using the gravity inversions and what again?
576.0,582.0," You know, yeah, they would they actually actually they actually do what they can to like try to hit me or like no actually turn off while walking"
582.0,586.8000000000001, Like I'll be on a wall and one's part and like they actually killed the gravity on me
586.8000000000001,592.24, And I'm like a crap and I fell and I did I already cool like puzzles with the spirit walking and
592.8,597.72," Portals because I remember yeah, yeah, they're thinking like hey, this could be really cool"
597.92,602.16, If they did the following things with this setup because it's when you disconnect yourself and then you right now
602.16,606.04, There actually are places where it's it seems like when I realized it was a spirit walking
606.04,607.4, Postal I was very happy
607.4,610.16, There's a place where it just seems like there's no way you can get by here
610.4,615.08, But that's because they have you standing in one place and you have to go over there the other place the spirit
615.08,616.08, There's a case
616.08,618.72," Yeah, definitely it does a pretty good job of mixing it up"
618.72,619.6800000000001, I mean
619.68,623.76, I mean like it seems like I really cheap gimmick to keep using the portals and the gravity and all that
624.0799999999999,628.0, But it's used to a decent effect and I had it is I just had a fun time playing it
628.0,632.3199999999999," No, I just say this was like the most original. Yeah, shooter. I've played in a long time"
632.3199999999999,636.76, I was seriously disoriented repeatedly like in a good way not yeah
636.76,639.5999999999999," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then they're just they're disorienting me"
639.5999999999999,645.3599999999999, But like it made me have to like reorient myself like because they intended it and it was fun and cool
645.36,650.4, It made me confused in the way I think the player like you know Tommy would have actually been in that situation
650.4,657.62," Mr. Hulk so yeah, and he's got a pet hawk too. Oh, yeah, he's like tell old G. I Joe character that came with the little plastic"
657.62,661.58," Oh, oh, oh, don't his wrist. I don't know. It's like saying there's a patchy chief on justice league"
661.58,662.58, I don't know
662.58,664.58, He has a pet hawk
664.58,669.4200000000001," Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna start that's right. That's right. Yeah, so actually you like"
669.4200000000001,673.82," Talk guys how far along are you? Well, they commune better with nature. You know the true Americans"
675.36,677.66," Yeah, I'm just I'm completely"
677.66,682.28," That's the assumption in the game. That's what I mean. Yeah, it's a spirit hog. It's a spirit guide"
683.04,686.96, He's on a visual. Hopefully essentially the twist at the end is the whole things of vision quest
687.6,694.3000000000001," Yeah, and then I recognize Cody comes out and cries rise. Yeah, you puke up. You see in first person"
694.3000000000001,696.76, You puke up the pay-o-de-buttons and then this is like oh
697.58,699.58, Oh
699.96,701.64, We're gonna pray everybody pray
702.64,704.64," Yeah, pray. We thumbs up from us"
704.76,712.0," We've got to pray just to make it today just despite a few misgivings. We like it so far. Yeah, the game. I've been playing. I think there's been playing"
712.0,719.38, tight-knit-titan quest Chon too. It thumbs up for tight-knit quest. I gotta say it's a harsh done it a few podcasts
719.38,724.48," I apologize, you know, it's it's my mind. It's basically a perfect version of the upload"
724.8000000000001,729.74," It is Diablo 2 again, which is what I listed about the first time, but you know"
729.74,734.64, What turns your rounds is quite a few years since the upload. It's not it's not too soon for
735.16,739.44," I mean, I don't know if it's a perfected version, but it's not too soon for an iteration of it"
739.44,743.84," Yeah, I think oh it's there's a lot of little things that are like you know"
743.84,746.88," It's still kind of like you know issues, but I think that it took a lot of the things that"
747.4,754.12, Made it fun Diablo 2 and probably won't find with better graphics and then still kind of like tweaked it like like this the skill trees
754.48,759.26, The skill trees the team then masteries are kind of interesting having the two trees to focus on
759.46,764.66, Give you a lot to think about in terms of how to allocate your points and you get that like the Mulligan
764.66,769.48," In fact, or so like if you if you don't like your situation, you can like pay to undo them and just mix it up a little"
770.2,772.7, Have you played it after the patch online?
772.7,779.12," Yeah, when I was playing not on law to disconnect issues or slates issues. Yeah, I've played it single player since the patch"
779.76,784.4, Which is nice it actually still hasn't fixed my graphics problem. I gotta say I still got to play the
784.48,787.6800000000001," Game in window mode weird. Yeah, that's crazy"
787.6800000000001,792.24, I mean I heard some people have an audio problems in this and then but I played it without problem
792.6800000000001,796.4," Yeah, I really like it. I mean it just it doesn't really do you know"
796.4,801.4," You can say that there's some innovations in terms of the skill tree or whatever, but it is basically is yeah"
801.4,803.84," Yeah, too, right it's got scorpions"
804.2,807.8000000000001, You go to the spider you go to the orient it turns into manned
808.8000000000001,812.16, I mean it's got all the kids those are the Asian scorpions scorpions
812.16,824.16," Yeah, I mean yeah, I mean yeah, I mean yeah, I mean it's not like someone cheating you encounter strike or something with a name box like how do you cheat in a cooperative game?"
824.16,825.16, What you do?
825.16,827.76, I mean some people that's confused a little bit of your characters
827.76,832.0, I've seen is like they've that skill tree you're talking about experimenting in and taking them all again
832.0,839.56, They don't have to because they basically have all the character and see what basically they're capable of at the end and kind of do like a test drive and say
839.9599999999999,846.3599999999999," All right, I think I'm gonna go with the spirit expertise for something like that, you know and then also back and forth with characters"
846.3599999999999,851.56, Like I even had someone so and gave me some gold basically took one character joined the server
851.56,855.3599999999999," Came in dropped a bunch of stuff for me. Yeah, came back in with the other one"
855.3599999999999,858.0799999999999, So little stuff like that and then some people like I don't know for some reason
858.0799999999999,862.04, I think it's because of the physics even though you ramp up and you kill everything in one click
862.28,867.9599999999999, It's just like and this is ultimately this is a game about clicking. It's like I realized those on the tough boss
867.96,871.6800000000001, I was like I killed me in two hits like if I could just click him three times
874.44,879.5600000000001, Because you don't even have the time at first when you start off I was a Paul because like I didn't even need my left hand
879.5600000000001,884.2800000000001," I was like yeah, even you know there was like no W a s d needs right. I was just like oh wow"
884.2800000000001,887.48, So this is a game where I just click on stuff huh and
887.88,895.3000000000001," But no, of course, it's not that way, but no, I mean you do need to try keys. He need all all your spells and attacks ready to go and I"
895.3,899.8599999999999," Mean when you get in the bigger fights with like a hoard of dudes all at once. Yeah, I quickly"
899.8599999999999,904.06, There is a little bit of tactics involved. I mean you're kind of right though
904.06,906.9399999999999, Well when you hit those guys with the big spells and stuff it's cool though
906.9399999999999,911.74, I mean if it's kind of like whoa physics is the stuff that you brag about in a shooter six years ago
911.74,917.8599999999999, But it's cool in a game like this because you're not used to at least I'm not used to you know hitting five guys and sending them over a cliff with some
917.8599999999999,920.8599999999999," Yeah, that's kind of farce bow and they get stuck in a tree sometimes"
921.38,924.34," Yeah, I like it then the you know the loot you know"
924.34,929.02, It's still impossible to not want to click on every chest and hope some cool piece of loot shows up
929.42,935.48," Have you have you been able to collect an entire set of like artifacts? No, I have oh of artifacts"
935.48,939.74," I mean, you know like a beat that art if whatever it is like the armor the gloves"
939.74,943.22, Lavin gotten a full set of like epic armor if that's what you mean
943.22,948.78," Yeah, I like it full sets of the relics to use to enchant armor. I mean, I mean another I meant the"
948.78,954.14, You know the full sets armor and whatever I worry that MMOs may have spoiled me for games like this for you
954.14,958.5799999999999, You know collecting these big epic sets armor because there's no one around really to brag to brag
958.5799999999999,963.86," Yeah, yeah, we'll jump in there and check out your armor. Yeah, we'll look just your armor"
964.6999999999999,968.14," Yeah, you could just have us cry around your monitor. See look it"
970.14,972.14, It doesn't have to be like
972.4599999999999,975.1," You know this goes for guild wars, too. It doesn't have to be a"
975.1,980.7, But Jillian people all trying to load the bizarre so they can buy a linen shirt or nothing
980.7,984.4200000000001, I mean you can have four people in the game or six people in the game and it's still you know
984.98,990.1, It's got the gauntlet vibe going to it and yeah two of those six people might really appreciate your armor
991.4200000000001,995.1800000000001," So buck-up shun all right, we'll we'll apologize for the armor"
996.3000000000001,999.6600000000001, What about they made a big deal about how all items in the game like
999.98,1004.54," Armored that the enemy wears is actual and that when you killed him it falls to the ground, but it seems so far like"
1005.18,1011.66, You can't really do anything with it like you kill some giant ogre chief didn't fool and you have his oversized harness and it's like
1011.98,1015.3," It all said instantly size to fit you or something. No, you can't use it"
1015.3,1018.14, It's just you got some your carrying around some ogre shirt
1018.14,1023.74," You can sell when you can use it some of it. Yeah, you get a salad. That's all those towers to me"
1023.74,1030.14," There's like oh, there's way too much money and there's way too much loot in the game like I haven't had money problems and forever"
1030.14,1035.6200000000001," I could buy whatever yeah, I got well over a million. I'm like well. Yeah, I have no concept of money and all the white armor"
1035.6200000000001,1039.26, I just see on the ground. I don't even loot that stuff. I only take any food
1039.26,1045.5," Yeah, so is that not challenging because of that or is it that's so challenging still is I mean the bigger fights are still"
1045.7,1049.1," Challenging and the you know, they're still that drive to want to get the cool loot"
1049.1,1053.26, So let's keep what's preventing you from being like super Uber is that you can't
1053.9,1058.6200000000001, Buy all of the great armor or inflation for the health just think about inflation let's do this
1060.6200000000001,1063.9," You get a lot of go, but it costs something you cost a lot of gold to get the cool magic stuff"
1064.38,1065.9, We need to play this multiplayer
1065.9,1072.38, We should make a map we should design a campaign that we can share with people actually working on that nice
1072.38,1077.18, Make sure you have a lot of like bottomless pits make it make it such a cave in the sense you walk in
1077.18,1079.68, You fall into a bottomless pit. But that you don't die
1079.68,1081.68, You just
1081.68,1085.6000000000001," It's kind of like what I did on the first person shooter thing, but I'm working we're really closely with Lord Gailin"
1086.16,1090.68, And we're gonna scorpion slayer too. It was like your first he's shooter Darren exactly
1091.5600000000002,1093.5600000000002, Ryan snap I don't want to you. I'm a buy-in
1095.2,1098.2," Wait, I don't think I've replied Darren's first person true. It was awful"
1099.0,1103.28, I'll we game it one star in week like I gave it zero stars a zero stars
1103.28,1106.5600000000002, Did we put it on the disk and like people couldn't get it to work or did
1106.56,1111.24," No, no, I reached that point no, actually we couldn't get we the timing didn't work out for the disk so I just made it"
1111.24,1113.74, I put it up online the timing didn't work out
1114.24,1119.04, Conveniently didn't get past our quality control people missed a whole lot
1119.6799999999998,1126.36," The room the room with every weapon in the game on it, but as soon as you you've dropped down like you couldn't jump in that game or something"
1126.36,1129.56, So as soon as you drop down over the one foot depression you can't get back out of the room
1130.56,1133.3999999999999," No, actually no, you could jump but you couldn't jump very far"
1133.4,1135.4, So I basically had it so you
1135.4,1139.6000000000001, This is a little platform you could walk out like one like it's a half-flate of stairs and then it drops out and there's nothing there
1139.6000000000001,1142.24, So you just kind of stuck in this room with all the cool all the cool weaponry
1142.24,1149.3600000000001, There's a little bit of that in Titan Quest and I think we maybe we've talked about that in the podcast before haven't we about the sort of weird
1149.6000000000001,1152.8600000000001, You know like the tank that can't get past the picket fence sort of thing
1153.1200000000001,1154.52," No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
1154.52,1157.48, It's a little bit of like you know you come upon these like one foot
1158.2,1163.28," High ridges that your character can't jump up. Yeah, the artificial barriers. Yeah"
1163.68,1168.88, I thought you're gonna talk about less time you you were passing by and you were complaining about how some guy
1168.88,1173.52, Needed you to clear out some scorpions so we could take the path to the next town and then you do it
1173.52,1177.6," You can't need still be there. You'd be like I cleaned all the scorpions. Yeah, that annoyed me"
1177.6,1180.1200000000001," Yeah, there's one quest early on in Titan Quest where yeah"
1180.1200000000001,1182.84, There's this old dude standing by the side of the rug with his cows
1182.84,1189.24, He can't get I can't get past you because he got the gobbins up ahead and he hooks you up with go-and thanks you
1189.24,1193.8799999999999," But that doesn't go right. Yeah, well you go back. You kill all the gobbins. He go back right and he says"
1193.8799999999999,1196.24, I think you're now I can get down to road with my couch
1196.6399999999999,1200.6599999999999, And you come back like five hours later. He's still standing there and if you click on it
1200.6599999999999,1205.32," He says the same will thank you again. Well, you're thanking me, but get going move"
1205.32,1207.24, I want to see like it's more a radiant day
1207.24,1212.4," If I get it I can't hear it. Oh, they're what in I mean how hard would it have been for me"
1212.4,1217.52, Think of help for the narrative if you saw that guy in that town and every time you saw him with his cows and the stall
1217.52,1221.04," You'd be like, you know, he's there there alive, but for me, but for my interview"
1221.04,1224.28," That's right, and he maybe he could tell some of the other townsfolk. I helped him"
1224.28,1227.96," That's a good John. Yeah, that's such a little little detail"
1227.96,1232.16, But like that's totally the kind of thing that when you're playing this breaks like a mercy
1232.16,1234.84," Kind of I mean, I'm sort of kidding, but I'm sort of not like"
1234.84,1239.1999999999998, We're not gonna stuff the hell of a blue shoot and spells and chopping at him because then it just makes it feel that much more
1239.1999999999998,1244.56, Artificial he's just gonna be standing there forever. It's just a theme bar. He doesn't he doesn't exist for real
1245.6799999999998,1247.84, He's there's not really an old man in the road
1247.84,1250.3999999999999, They were saying like if they do make that world of workcraft movie
1250.52,1254.84, What's there's gonna be a bunch of heroes in a line and you'll see like before the climatic battle at the end
1254.84,1257.36, And if I did drag and you'll see a bunch of people just killing it
1257.6,1259.6," Then the rest all right guys, we're up"
1260.36,1262.7199999999998, That would have to be the very last scene of the wow move
1262.7199999999998,1264.7199999999998," Yeah, you're a monster respawning"
1267.3999999999999,1272.28, It's weird we kind of get over that though. Don't you I mean like at this point that doesn't bother me in
1272.9199999999998,1279.1999999999998," MMO anymore. Yeah, I don't I can't even I've thought of trying to think about like how else they could possibly do it and still make it in MMO"
1279.1999999999998,1284.6399999999999, And I can't think of any way and obviously no one else can so I just remember one time and a long time ago
1284.64,1289.1200000000001, Wow a bunch of us who are online and we didn't know each other was just in general chat
1289.1200000000001,1292.96, We're having the sort of meta discussion about who's the guy you kill in a
1293.8400000000001,1295.3600000000001, Goldshire
1295.3600000000001,1296.96, It's like van cleafers
1296.96,1301.3200000000002, Oh in deadlines van cleaf here dead my that's right on top of the planet somebody somebody said in general
1301.48,1307.5600000000002, There was a group looking for a group. You know looking for a group to kill van cleaf and somebody said like man poor van cleaf
1307.5600000000002,1311.68, That dude's been killed like 40 times today already. You know and everyone just talked about
1312.68,1313.68, You know
1313.68,1319.24," Yeah, but what can we do get die forever? Yeah, it's just kind of like Disney world"
1319.24,1323.2, You kind of accept that there's other people going to go on the Indiana Jones adventure when you're done
1324.3200000000002,1328.72," Right able get the gold to yeah, and it's fun than you kind of deal with that"
1329.28,1331.44, And that's why something like a blivy and like
1331.92,1337.44, Works because you're actually affecting the world and like there is someone coming along even though
1337.44,1342.16, There's a lot of similar gameplay mechanics and you're like I'm still in an open-ended RPG world like
1342.88,1346.48, There's this all there's no one's gonna come around and do what you just did yeah
1346.48,1351.0800000000002," No, there's a question you solve to though, I mean, but the quests do end and they do have"
1351.76,1356.0400000000002, Consequences right but sometimes it's like you pick some dudes pocket or something and all of sudden
1356.0400000000002,1359.0800000000002, He turns around the next guy. How do you neighbor and punch him in the face and like
1359.64,1363.3200000000002," Second yeah, I still some of that never mind"
1364.3600000000001,1371.52," So did you did you kill van cleaf? Yeah, of course with prejudice all right any new can kill van cleaf"
1371.52,1373.52," Yeah, Ryan oh"
1374.28,1377.6399999999999, Maybe I you talking like that. I can't kill van cleaf and kill the world
1377.6399999999999,1382.8," Hello, I still playing guild wars by the way. Yeah, we have to do this every week"
1382.8,1389.6399999999999, The guild wars check how many hours are you times because of how many hours though? I think the character that I've been playing my Ranger
1389.6399999999999,1399.0, I think I just broke 200 hours 200 something at this point. Wow a 200 hours of your life gone or maybe God when I wrote through a view was like
1399.0,1401.0, 172 hours and that was
1402.0,1404.8," Nearly a month ago, so you've only played 30 hours"
1404.8,1411.9, It's gotta be up in the high 200. I just broke a million experience with him now. Bravo. So I
1412.8,1416.0, Thought your mom was proud. I just broke a million van cleaf
1417.56,1422.86, If your mom heard that what she'd be proud my son. She has a million XP now
1423.76,1425.76, All this talk is shameful
1429.0,1431.0," Wow, he won't even answer me"
1431.0,1435.0, I'm sorry Ryan. We'll give us some more at least we were talking guilders give us something really
1435.0,1441.96, Crimidating it's some for the folks out there listening drop a pro with how do you what have you done in that game when you even where you stopped and said yourself
1441.96,1446.72, I can't let it anyone find out about this and then now's your chance to let him off find the opposite
1447.36,1452.44, So I'm the one everyone in the side. I was such a baddest tonight because I did
1455.88,1457.88, I
1457.88,1464.72, I've gotten I've gone through all of the all the main story missions. There's there's three tiers of rewards in each of them
1465.5200000000002,1467.92, Depending on like how quickly you complete the missions
1468.2800000000002,1475.72, You can get like a standard expert in masters reward. I just say I just finished all those on master this weekend
1475.72,1478.7600000000002, I got my last one for awesome remember when actually
1479.3600000000001,1482.3200000000002, Back on the Atari days would have like these patches
1482.32,1484.32, Get like you guys
1484.52,1489.24," Cerm go with this you remember that yeah, like so if you buy their game or or beat it or get some score"
1489.24,1493.32, You get a patch for it and you put them on this jacket like if you can get that for guilders would you rock it?
1493.6399999999999,1495.6399999999999, I'll know
1497.08,1499.28, Come on the guild worship you. I could you tell it rock that I
1500.32,1502.62, Rock it first I feel those past I don't feel
1504.52,1508.5, I thought you don't wear my game sound you know where I just plan on where that crap
1508.5,1511.22, Oh give me a break
1511.22,1513.22, I mean a freaking break
1513.78,1518.22, Skate said that when you first started you said something like you know this test isn't for sale
1518.82,1520.82, When I said if you wanted a game shirt
1522.82,1528.26, Excuse me working for you as a walking go mine is I just try not to like where your name brands like that
1528.26,1531.7," I also it's not just gaming no, it's not just gaming. I mean it's like"
1532.74,1537.3, I don't know it's like people got a pay for every time now. They're always just kind of like my face
1537.3,1541.98," Ungrur shirts, you know like under this I got a black button down shirt. I'm gonna strip"
1543.78,1545.94," Yeah, I'll say Bethesda"
1546.94,1553.3799999999999, It's not as bad as like if you're wearing a NASCAR jacket where you're like tipping to biscoe and Oreo and Pepsi and Walmart
1553.3799999999999,1559.8999999999999, I saw some guy wearing I was at a cafe in San Francisco the sky's wearing like a leather bud light jacket
1560.06,1562.06, It's nice. That's nice. That hell
1563.1399999999999,1566.26, We've brought a little bit of leather and buddy. There's some guy
1566.26,1570.06, I take the train that's like a silk boons farm sweater
1570.74,1574.42," Yeah, I take the train to and from work every day and there's this guy"
1574.42,1580.42, It's always on the train when I go home when he's always wearing like there's star wars leather jacket with like Darth Maul on the back
1580.42,1582.42," Oh, man. I'm like an Indiana drone shirt"
1582.42,1588.74," Is it less or is it one of those? Yes, it's leather those pseudo silk polyester ones where they've got you know"
1588.74,1593.22, It's like the print everywhere on it. It's like though. How have some dungeons and dragons drag like
1593.22,1597.98, Rehive fire like down the sleeves and all the belly. Hey Ryan isn't like our demographic
1597.98,1600.7, What if the guy's listening to us on the podcast as you're describing it?
1600.7,1602.84," Well, no, I'll try it on how we just know right now"
1602.84,1606.84, It's me not we just want to say that you're cool to burn or we'll give you some free games
1607.58,1610.78," Now we think your cool sir. Yeah, if you're listening"
1610.78,1612.78, If you're not you're a jack
1613.58,1617.8600000000001," By some real please put Darth Vader on right? Yeah, I was just noticing he's wearing a shirt"
1617.8600000000001,1622.44," This is strictly for my ninjas, but there's like there's irony in that though like the Darth Maul"
1623.0,1625.3600000000001," Like the guy's trick. I mean well, maybe you're like"
1625.72,1628.92," You wind it these are my ninjas these are ninjas, but the Darth Maul guys"
1629.72,1631.96, That's probably the most significant
1632.96,1635.44, Edition to the Star Wars Sith gallery
1639.72,1641.72, Biggie's funny
1641.72,1644.52," Yeah, you know you're right if you're gonna pick any star as character"
1645.0,1647.88, I mean isn't he just like I'd not talk about Jar Jar
1648.48,1649.76, He's bad
1649.76,1650.6, He's bad
1650.6,1656.02, He was the only thing was nice. He came out and the even like the the most
1656.52,1660.2," Hopeless apologetics people for that would be like well, it's got Darth Maul"
1660.2,1664.64, You see those lightsaber battles. He left me so called he doesn't say anything
1665.24,1668.2, He's like a robot. It's just it's just a
1668.84,1675.8, He's just a dream screen wire stunt fool boy if we circumvent the stars here all right that'll be great for the letters though
1675.8,1678.12," Yeah, start excuse me"
1680.56,1687.68, You know if you just like or if you know the names of the random Jedi council people and I mean I'm pretty bad since I said Jedi council
1688.68,1693.04," It's written a row dude sitting in a semi-circuit. Yeah, but the glow sticks, but"
1694.28,1698.56, But like if you know you know how there's all those random ones the guys with like the big bone or heads and stuff
1699.16,1701.16, You know that guy's name
1701.16,1704.24, A ragnars shotgun. You just been alive for a four thousand
1705.2,1710.2, By the way when he said boner he meant this like a like a bone like in right
1711.24,1715.58," No, it's joke. Oh, yeah, what a bone are you made? Yes, okay?"
1717.64,1723.56, You know somebody somebody on the forums called our early podcast a train wreck
1723.56,1725.56, I think this might be
1726.56,1729.4, Look at let's train that con topic. It's talking about
1730.2,1736.0400000000002, Recently it turns out I guess that a lot of people are dying in half life two episode one
1736.0400000000002,1741.2800000000002, I love it or seen that's right. That's basically the part if you haven't played where you're you're going down on an elevator
1741.2800000000002,1745.4, You've got your psychic Alex with you in the large pieces of the citadel are falling on your head
1745.4,1752.96, Right and Alex is your indication that you need to look up and use your gravity gun to grab these things before they fall and break your glass elevator
1752.96,1757.52, So I guess all the stats because you know steam tracks everything you do in the game
1757.52,1761.78, Whether you're looking at Alex's ass or trying to get through the elevator allow
1762.28,1764.28, trouble so it turned out that
1764.56,1770.72, A lot of people were dying so they actually patched the game now to make that significantly easy and the controversy then is you know
1770.72,1774.08, Is that catering to the lowest common denominator and dumb in the game down because
1775.28,1777.28, Maybe that was actually just nice
1777.84,1779.84, Maybe they were just doing people a favor
1780.28,1782.68, What if what if what if you don't want that favor
1783.2,1787.68," Like how hard was that section for you? You know, it's like you maybe died once like I died one skin"
1787.68,1792.04," Then I realized oh yeah, I gotta take care of I probably died a few more times than once"
1792.04,1796.6000000000001," But but you know, I mean first you have to figure out what's going on right like oh geez"
1796.6000000000001,1799.4," Okay, so I have to make sure these things don't hit the platform"
1800.04,1803.92, And then it took me like two or three times to get it right. It's basically like a shooting gallery
1803.92,1808.28," Yeah, you just have to look up will you look up and catch the thing catch it and shoot them before they"
1808.28,1811.64, It is interesting kind of design thing in that game because
1812.2,1818.44," You have to get the cue and then do something or your face with the reloading screen, you know, yeah, and that's like"
1819.5600000000002,1824.44," That was probably the biggest annoying, right was the reloading screen might have been nice if Alex just said"
1825.3200000000002,1827.64, I don't know well how could hells could they have done it?
1827.64,1832.1200000000001," Yeah, I mean that's just the thing this you create a scenario like that where I mean something is coming"
1832.1200000000001,1835.72, It's coming in a scripted moment you have to do something to get away from it
1835.72,1838.7800000000002, Are you dying it's really like early old school mentality and
1839.1,1844.62," To die first to learn what you should do yeah, I mean just the way things have gone like for example"
1844.62,1850.94, I mean I can't I can give one anecdote for my visit to CryTech in Germany and what they're doing with crisis and we were actually talking about that scene
1851.34,1853.82, And that sort of thing is actually like you know
1853.82,1856.1399999999999, It's anathema to them and what they're trying to accomplish so
1857.26,1858.46, In this case
1858.46,1863.5, Put a hypothetical example out where you're trying to get on the back of a plant a cargo plane and you're in a Jeep and
1863.8999999999999,1867.74, You know say if you make that you got the timing and you get your Jeep in there and you take off
1867.82,1873.58," That's fine, but if you miss it, they're not gonna make you restart the level then you go wait and something else happens and maybe a helicopter will come and get you"
1873.58,1879.18," Or maybe you can take a back road in the Jeep and and just end up doing something else, but I mean"
1879.58,1883.74," So yeah, I mean I suppose we're people to say that it's just not a good"
1884.14,1889.18, Maybe the debris just could have kept falling down. I mean there might have been a way to not have you hit the end game screen
1889.58,1894.94, I don't know you're right that part because I guess it kind of comes down to like I mean say you know immediately before that
1894.94,1902.06, We're a dog throws you over the pit in the car and if it was like if you didn't press mouse one at the right time and then you'd actually
1902.46,1906.3400000000001, Instead of making it you'd actually get crushed or something like that and then after reload
1906.3400000000001,1909.18, I don't know it's really it's really like that really rigid really simple
1909.8200000000002,1915.26, There's no funny. I don't go away from that hole incident was more it wasn't the fact that they patched or which I don't care
1915.26,1919.3400000000001, I got past it but whatever the just the fact that they're actually tracking all that stuff
1919.3400000000001,1921.8200000000002, I thought was the interesting part. Yeah definitely you know
1921.82,1926.1, I mean they're watching they can watch everything we do in the game and they'll now well creep
1926.1,1930.22, They showed graphs like if you could opt in I think I mean basically the if you in the lot in the menu
1930.22,1933.06," Just so you can like opt in for no floating your stats. No, they're watching"
1933.06,1937.46," You don't stop in in city can but I guess okay leave it on for everything. Yeah, this this one"
1937.46,1944.1799999999998, It's it's everything and you can't see their graphs like where they have curves for where people are dying and you'll see him spike on certain areas
1945.1799999999998,1950.62, How long they're spending and how far they're making it for they turn and turn the game off and all that stuff
1950.62,1956.3799999999999," It is great feedback for them, I guess right I mean yeah, it's holy should be it's just a matter of I mean"
1956.3799999999999,1957.9799999999998, I don't know I don't really
1957.9799999999998,1963.26," Suspect their danger of it, but just like kind of design by committee where you're letting right I mean games are interactive"
1963.26,1968.62," And you've got to have you know you've got a cater to the player obviously, but the ramifications are just kind of huge"
1968.62,1973.8999999999999," Oh, yeah, I don't want a game company to know that I might you know dancing around naked. You know"
1975.5,1977.5, I mean I guess I won't do that in real life
1977.5,1981.06," But if I'm doing it inside their game, I mean what can you really do and"
1981.58,1984.98," What it's not like they're getting a lot of credit. Yeah, releasing your credit card number"
1984.98,1990.86," It was like you did 50 times on the elevator thing. I mean it's it's a criminalating, but it's not like it's not like they caught you"
1990.86,1996.02," Oh god, that's so true that dance around naked like you're saying right, but what if you're what if you're reviewing the game?"
1996.54,2002.5," And that's the rad part that's kind of cool isn't it? Yeah, because you review the game and you give it a lame score say and"
2002.5,2008.42," They say hey, you know what we know from watching you only played for half an hour, dude right that actually happened once a while ago"
2008.42,2011.22," Yeah, that's not slow no, no, tgw"
2011.22,2012.42, Not with the way to the end
2012.42,2014.62, It was a game spot pad
2014.62,2016.62, Don't say nope sorry
2016.62,2021.46," All right, it was a freelance well we just we think I could be wrong. No, no, the game was a savage"
2022.1,2025.54," No, the multiplayer game and they did statt they do stat tracking on"
2026.1,2030.42, People will have the whole game right person reviewed the game whoever it was I know
2030.74,2036.5," Yeah, you can do that with battlefield too because I mean I personally went to like you know as we were playing the last the booster that came out"
2036.5,2041.5800000000002, I actually you know I saw the people in the test things and like oh this guys from this place and this guys from that
2041.5800000000002,2046.5800000000002, And I was kind of curious to see if anyone else out there is as into it as I am and I won't name name is
2046.5800000000002,2052.1, But I found quite a few who had less fewer than a hundred global points which is about what I'll average in a single game
2052.66,2057.2200000000003," So and if I'm a you know if a lot of people are at about 800,000 or something"
2057.74,2062.3399999999997, They'll give you an idea of how Thoritative us so what reviews are out there?
2062.8599999999997,2064.3799999999997, That's good to know I
2064.7799999999997,2069.7, Think and it breaks it down at the time too. I mean you could see they spent so and so amount of time on this specific map
2070.02,2075.14," They died this many times. I mean, basically everything every kind of information you can want from the thing"
2075.7,2079.9399999999996, So I would make a difference. I would certainly want to know if I was for the game company
2080.14,2082.4599999999996, How long some more on your game making a five
2082.86,2086.9," blade. Yeah, I mean you don't want it. Yeah, you don't want to go to the ad home and thing or be too insecure"
2086.9,2092.82," But it's like yeah, if you did put all your livelihood into something in someone rips it at least if you look you're like"
2093.18,2097.66," All right, they definitely played it more than what we expect the average person to I mean"
2097.66,2103.34, That's a third definitely qualified to come to these conclusions or just inversely like you found out
2103.82,2111.42, I mean they barely got past the curve that they expect most people to to go through in one day and then continue to play for months and months after that
2112.46,2117.34, And then I think it's a valid point that you can make I think they're they're qualified to make a case for themselves
2120.62,2122.62, I agree
2123.5,2130.06, So I think they think they should track our hours playing when we review games in general
2130.38,2131.58," Well, I mean"
2131.58,2137.34, You're the reviews editor some games they just they just do I mean like I'm sure they track like wow
2138.2200000000003,2144.02, It's almost like a third party a third this interest at party would have to do it for it to seem like really
2144.9,2148.86, Fair because then there's like this potential for this kind of weird antagonism where a
2149.1800000000003,2154.26, Publishers trying to police the critics and that's that kind of can lead to some bad precedent and then
2155.02,2161.1400000000003, This and that but if there's like some kind of like the gaming obmbed to monitor something who's just like out there to make sure everyone's
2161.58,2163.58, playing right
2163.58,2168.04," I mean somebody's not playing right that's partially, you know the publications fault"
2168.5,2176.2999999999997," Right, well you would think it would show up in the review you know like you can tell any of us can tell we can tell when we're reading the review"
2176.2999999999997,2180.58, And it's clear they played the game for five hours. I'm just saying you don't want those scenarios
2180.58,2184.8199999999997, Words like say you made I don't know what some horrible don't movie that just came out
2184.8199999999997,2189.98," But anyway, you're the the director of that and you read a review and then you start to click email"
2189.98,2193.5," Or you buy a page in the times, you know for clicking you're like you just this guy"
2193.5,2198.02, He just didn't understand he didn't see the significance that the Ramot is really like the holy grail
2200.02,2202.02, So I mean you get to some
2204.26,2211.7400000000002," Subtential nastiness I guess yeah, I think we'll work with a third party, but as far as I mean I like the idea behind it"
2211.7400000000002,2215.9," Kind of keeps everyone honest, but at the same point everyone's gonna have an agenda with that"
2215.9,2219.26, So you have to have a gaming obmbudsman or home ever right
2219.98,2224.14, I think it's probably safe to say that will never happen exactly so in that case to horrible thing
2224.62,2228.62, It'd be interesting to see how it feeds conspiracy theories though because just the very idea
2228.62,2232.46, I mean you see how we react you have to think about it as soon as you know you're being watched immediately people
2232.46,2236.78, I honestly my take on what valve did is I don't see it as a problem at all
2236.78,2238.06, I mean
2238.06,2241.7400000000002, It just speaks to their design technique just instead of like
2241.98,2245.14, You know the lead designer saying what I have done is gospel
2245.14,2248.54," They kind of yeah, it is the players and the reactions right"
2248.62,2253.42," I mean, I don't know if you're the developer and you're watching the stats and I didn't look at the stats for this"
2253.42,2256.7799999999997, But if 80% of people play are getting stuck there
2257.34,2259.1, Why not why not make it easier?
2259.1,2263.42, Well the other thing too is that like because you're not it's not a patch that
2263.9,2267.66," You know, as a matter of a mission where you're deciding to download it's gonna auto update"
2267.98,2273.2599999999998, So unlike other games where there are various patched iterations and you could say well one point two is the best
2273.2599999999998,2277.58," And that's how I want to remember this game. That's yeah, play it's like it's conceivably gone"
2277.66,2281.1, You're the game that was your I mean if this sort of thing would continue hypothetically
2281.1,2286.54, So you know right here from now the game that you played and experience would well no one here exists or be available
2286.94,2289.9," Right, I mean, but just keep in mind it's like this decision they made here"
2290.06,2294.7, Those are the decisions are making all along when they're developing a game. They are right? I mean every puzzle
2294.7,2300.14, Every jumping thing every shooting matches is balanced and all so this is just they did arrayed it on according to
2300.7,2304.06, According to their own play testing right so this is just further play testing
2305.66,2307.42, You didn't bug me
2308.2999999999997,2310.2999999999997, All in a touch of mercy that wasn't cut to versatile
2311.2599999999998,2314.94," Yeah, so we got we got have some that all we got well"
2315.34,2318.62, How we doing on time they're down you can say out loud about 40 about
2318.62,2323.2599999999998, I think about 38 minutes that's a lot of times a lot of time maybe we're done for this week
2323.66,2324.62, Right
2324.62,2326.94," All right, it's got a little teaser here. Oh, I"
2327.5,2329.5," Got before we go yes, sir"
2331.2599999999998,2334.06," Our August cover story. Oh, yeah"
2334.14,2339.9," Is it August is August? It's August. Okay, um should we get our copybacks in the printer is really soon?"
2340.2999999999997,2346.38," Yeah, well the issue that we just we just finish and you will be seeing on store shelves around the 25th"
2347.1,2352.38, Subscribers will begin this week. I believe has a little game called salmon max on it
2353.2599999999998,2356.2999999999997, Whoot and people have been waiting
2357.42,2363.98, 13 13 13 years and have weathered two canceled games for like a real sequel
2364.06,2366.06, to salmon max hit the road and
2367.18,2373.5," We've got the story for you. Yeah, so go buy our magazine only in CGW on sales soon"
2373.66,2380.86, It's looking awesome so far. I'm very psyched for you can see all those cool covers to the ones the box that they made that we didn't use there on there on the telltale
2380.86,2382.86, Side telltale game on our box
2383.58,2390.06," Yeah, yeah, salmon max artist steeper sell drew us and painted an original piece of artwork for our cover"
2390.2999999999997,2396.38," Right, so when you see the August cover that is an original piece of art by the the very creator of salmon max"
2396.38,2398.38, He did it just for us
2399.2599999999998,2404.22," So we're very excited about that sir, and if you didn't play the first salmon max you are missing out on one of the"
2404.86,2409.7799999999997, Greatest I won't even say adventure games one of the greatest games. He greatest of all PC game
2410.7799999999997,2412.7799999999997, You really think that is I
2412.7799999999997,2415.9, You know what adventure games are really adventure like that it's
2416.86,2421.9, For a vintage game has always been a toss up for me between that and Gabriel night one like those are my two
2422.2200000000003,2423.7400000000002, favorite of interiors
2423.7400000000002,2429.7400000000002, That's always bring up that's Gabriel night three is the one one one and two were good
2430.46,2434.8, So I put salmon max in the top ten. It would definitely be up there
2436.62,2439.26, You would agree yeah
2439.82,2443.5, hilarious game and so finally a sequel and we got the story
2444.46,2446.46, Xie Ryan got the story
2446.7,2448.7," Way to go Ryan oh, yeah"
2450.46,2454.86," All right, I think we're done for this thing so we're sorry that we weren't here for two weeks"
2455.42,2457.42, We're sorry that we sucked this week
2458.62,2460.94, Rambled on for like 40 minutes so we did
2461.9,2466.22, But thank y'all for listening and thank you for missing us this last couple weeks
2466.62,2471.1," I don't know who all those people were we said they miss us, but I have a feeling they might have been it's probably the furry is"
2471.58,2473.3399999999997, My furries and Darren's mom
2473.98,2478.94, Hopefully it goes on to sing hopefully there's no crossover last I heard no she's quit cold turkey
2479.66,2485.66," You okay? All right, we will see y'all again next week and thank you for listening love you well"
