96.16000000000001,102.84," Yeah, we think like they used to and we're on a big nostalgic kick here at CGW because we're working on the very last issue"
102.84,106.56, And that we're doing a retrospective feature and by the way
106.56,110.36," It's official now, so I'll say it on air all all three formers"
110.76,115.24000000000001, CDW editors enter and chiefs are contributing to this piece so that's gonna be a lot of fun
115.74000000000001,123.48, And some some extra special surprise that we're gonna get that surprise right? What's going on? What about Scorpia with the with the five extra special things?

136.35999999999999,141.96, But we've been looking through these old issues here and there's some just really great stuff really funny stuff
141.96,148.28, Just sitting here off the bat the first thing I think the good thing about going back through the old issues is just to remind you that it's same as it ever was
148.28,150.16, I mean for all this stuff that's changed like
150.16,151.76, I think on rip and off armans
151.76,155.16, We've matured to now where we have women in baths that was with toe scars in there with them
155.16,160.16, But like Ryan was just holding it's purely black and white the entire thing's black and white
160.16,163.04, But it's like 70% of the games and they're have to do the world war two
163.04,168.14," Yeah, oh yeah, I was a special world war two issue. Oh, it's a matter of fact"
168.14,173.34, So there's quite a few in the one I've got right here as well. So it's just kind of like a you know two's always always positive
173.34,179.0, It's usual it's funny my my wife looked at the picked up the situation last night and it's what's a total page count there Ryan?
179.0,180.0, It's like
180.0,182.0, If he
182.0,185.0, 58 pages and it's black and white and it looks like you know
185.0,189.84, So you put together and print shop and high school and I think and I think it's just keep with that together
190.8,193.74, Pretty much but her reaction was was
194.22,198.48000000000002, Say boy it sure had a lot less ads and you guys have now as if that was a good thing
199.44,205.48000000000002," Well, that's because no one would advertise in there. There are some ads in there, but they're they're just completely random"
205.48000000000002,209.64000000000001," Yeah, I was like kind of like you know by Joe's games and then there's like a PO box"
209.64000000000001,214.24, I'm trying to find a war again. We're increasingly getting off topic in the new this topic
214.24,216.24, We're not even on
216.24,220.28, Start it we started talking when we get to him later in the podcast and I find you have some awesome
220.92000000000002,224.32000000000002, advertisements for porn based games in this 95 issue
226.32000000000002,228.12, For those so they must be in the back. All right
228.12,233.28, Like I'd have it. Okay. Here we go. There you go. There you go. Bloods interactive to imprecede a pleasure and great game
233.28,237.44," By the way, okay, it's like a woman with a Canadian Mounties jacket on open up and"
238.20000000000002,240.04000000000002, a bikini bottom and then a
240.04,244.35999999999999, of a grizzly bear with the bikini top in his mouth is just prepping inside
244.92,249.23999999999998, Wow and then then the tagline is even butter than the first one
250.95999999999998,255.0," Wow, wow, then we've got and they say we've gone downhill"
256.24,260.56," I'm around. Yeah, so yeah, what people right in because in our last"
260.96,263.92, We'll not our last issue but two issues are going on the letter bag
263.92,267.71999999999997," We had you know someone complaining about the quality of the ads and stuff. Yeah, so look at here"
267.72,272.68, We've also in addition to the C-Mor butts too. We have dirty debby tons to the Asian invasion
272.92,275.8, So with this one CD right there's a
279.8,281.8, And then there's like
282.6,289.68, Vieta means looking woman in the background and then like the craziest pub stash dude with giant aviator glasses down in the bottom
289.68,291.68, And like stickiness tongue out
291.68,293.68, I want to give me some of that
293.96,300.2," It's so bad. Yeah, you know people may not know this who are our recent when I say recent like within this decade"
300.92,306.08," Computer gaming older readers we used to have poor nets in the back of the magazine nice. Yeah, so"
307.16,309.16, So stuff complaining
309.16,311.64, Or maybe start complaining if you wish they were back
313.12,315.12, We want poor nets
315.12,319.92, Actually my highlight of my favorite part of that issue that you're holding song was the ad for
320.28000000000003,326.24, Wing commander three up front where a wing commander three was very much in the interactive movie days
326.24,330.28000000000003, So it started a Mark Hamel. There we go Mark Hamel and Malcolm up down
330.6,335.44," Yeah, and the active tag line is don't watch the game play the movie"
336.32,342.44," Nice FMV all the time even though yeah, my favorite part is that the cover asks the question are"
342.44,345.88," Doce games to head. Yeah, I think the answer was yes"
346.8,351.14, I think we know the answer though in fact actually I read the article and we hedged a little bit
351.14,353.14, We said
353.14,355.14, Yep
355.14,357.14," Well, maybe they're dead"
357.14,361.74, We're actually saying if you like to graphic 3D graphic intensive games at that time
361.74,366.96, You may not want to upgrade when 95 yet you may want to hold on to a gosh the background art
366.96,368.24, I love it's just some like
368.24,373.12," Well Google didn't exist at the time. I don't believe it did, but just it's like a photo shot"
373.12,378.12, Just like a picture of lightning stores like the kind you'd have from like whatever it's a dignity and then it would define it for
380.12,383.24, It's like a success race poster or something like that with like yeah
384.24,388.88," synergy or something yeah, of course, you know, we're sitting here now making fun of this if you and right"
388.88,393.16, 11 years from now yet the current staff will be making fun of our crappy if you
393.16,396.68, I expect no other half of cars but goes around comes around. That's how it goes
397.12,399.44, That's just like the what we deal with though
399.44,403.24," It's such a you know, I mean as much as we want to talk about timeless classics and games"
403.24,406.28, I mean there are relatively there's so few of them you know
406.28,409.4, I mean I look back on stuff that I reviewed you know three years ago
409.8,413.32, Like what the hell was that how did that come out? Why did it exist?
413.8,418.8, I remember this is that game freaky flyers and it was like a a cart racing game with planes
419.0,424.24, But they all had like these you know baditude personalities and they're all extreme each one of a generic
424.8,425.8, ethnicity
425.88,428.08, But it hadn't had an awesome song anyway
428.08,431.44, You're right. I was sitting up to sing the song and she'll give it the cut
431.72,434.44," Get the shit on road no is a scratching my neck. Oh, okay"
437.24,441.90000000000003," What happens when the sound guy makes gestures. Yeah. Well, am I alright? I'm knocking this funny"
441.90000000000003,443.8, I wonder what that gesture was too. He was just
444.92,447.92," What but I now see if I was like the rapid-up box. No, no, sorry"
448.76,453.40000000000003," I'm not being ready careful Sean. Yeah, I believe you have twitch power Sean. That's how this board makes me powerful"
454.35999999999996,459.4," Okay, so we actually do have topics today other than random stuff. We have the usual what do you plan?"
459.88,461.88, we had
461.88,467.08, a friend the analyst come out today with an interesting comments on PC gaming a guy for
467.56,472.03999999999996," Well, we'll talk about a later, but he said some things about PC gaming that we want to like completely like"
472.71999999999997,474.71999999999997, Make fun of basically
474.71999999999997,476.71999999999997, Because my mom out of this
476.71999999999997,481.56," I don't want to say anything bad about the guy, but these statements are kind of moronic and he must be sort of an idiot"
481.56,484.28000000000003, But you don't want to say I don't want to say I don't want to say I don't want to say

726.56,730.3199999999999, And I had some I ran into some serious problems this weekend could not
730.84,734.7, Try check in the rage drivers and all the other you know what I'll spray the nerd talk basically
734.7,738.9000000000001, I spent about four and a half hours on tech support calls over the weekend
738.9000000000001,744.82, Oh God and no one had an answer for me and then when it got to like the last like I was like after you being transferred
744.82,746.62, I think I'm I feel like a world traveler this weekend
746.62,750.58, I was talking all like all these I've been these new friends in India now and then afterwards
750.58,751.58, I got I
751.58,754.7800000000001, You're gonna put the ATI drive out of me to the end video
756.0600000000001,757.58, Yeah
757.58,759.58, Man I had to say
759.58,762.94," Not PC, but I've had it happen before it is not compatible"
763.0600000000001,766.0600000000001," No, but actually I got to say like disclaimer for our Indian friend"
767.0600000000001,769.0600000000001, So but I got to say
769.0600000000001,772.0600000000001, Every week we do love you
773.34,777.6600000000001, Everyone I talked to was actually really cool about it like they were trying to be supportive and helpful
777.6600000000001,783.0200000000001, They didn't know it was going on until I got to the last guy like I was the tier two support who basically says to me
783.0200000000001,784.0200000000001, He goes
784.0200000000001,788.94, Do you you might you might need a new floppy disk and I like what it goes
788.94,793.58," Yeah, your driver's might be corrupt and you need a new floppy disk or something and what would that ever do it?"
793.58,795.82," a floppy that's what I said anyway, so"
796.46,801.6600000000001, Since that I mean it's kind of funny. So I bet I basically I went through this whole thing acting as Joe consumer
801.6600000000001,803.4200000000001, I did not pull the the
803.4200000000001,806.1400000000001," You know who I am yeah, yeah, yeah, for me"
807.74,809.1, I didn't pull any of that crap
809.1,813.6600000000001, I just wanted to see you know how it worked you know as you know the Joe consumer experience and I got to tell you
813.6600000000001,815.6600000000001, I it sucked
815.6600000000001,816.7, I
817.1800000000001,822.5400000000001, Have a whole new level of respect for people who got to deal with this day in day out just you know who buy the computers and such
823.74,826.1400000000001, So so far in this podcast we have alienated
826.94,831.9000000000001, Dell we're making it and the people of India we're making it all right because we're self-deprecating now
831.9000000000001,833.9000000000001, Let's just parody ourselves
833.9000000000001,835.9000000000001, Got this computer
835.9000000000001,838.7," Yeah, well, is it held there all is it plugged in?"
839.98,841.34, No
841.34,843.34, All right now we're even okay
843.34,844.0600000000001, Exactly
844.06,847.5," Well, I mean like I so I look for all thank you C.G.W"
847.5,848.3, Exactly
848.3,851.5799999999999," Oh, come so I'm just wrapped this up really quick but basically I"
852.8599999999999,858.78, They say I got obviously I got to kind of like a different kind of level of treatment because I talked to the PR person the morning saying hey
858.78,865.26, What's going on and and immediately I got a call back from some guy who is a part in charge of tech support right and and the way he
865.26,869.9, Explains it to me goes like every once in a while there these calls that they they don't get the service they expect and this is this guy
869.9,871.42," Actually, it's this guy's job"
871.5799999999999,879.02, To call people every day who don't get the service they expect so it is a learning experience for them to and he's saying that he told me that
879.42,883.9799999999999, You know obviously they try to like find these trouble cases that have these problems and he makes like
884.62,887.8199999999999, He deals with like 10 specific or so cases a week like mine
887.9799999999999,891.18," That's gotta be a fun job. Yeah, I can imagine I mean I I"
891.18,893.3399999999999, Appreciate what the dude was doing and I mean
893.9799999999999,896.6999999999999," Well, hopefully we'll get it hopefully get the problem results and I can write about it"
896.6999999999999,900.62," Well, just some a second time next week sweet. I got seven days all"
902.38,906.2199999999999, The Vulture waiting in the in the wings to get feet on your your life
906.2199999999999,911.9799999999999," My carry in yeah, you totally is but then you like I was gonna set to go pick up some parts over the weekend and Darren's like"
912.38,915.42, Got a copy of windows you got a hard drive. I was like
916.6999999999999,918.6999999999999," Yeah, he's got a reform at the hard drive"
919.8199999999999,922.78, So so so basically I'm gonna get the thing fixed and I mean like
923.5799999999999,926.86, Again the people who who I actually talked to with the phone were pretty you know
926.94,930.3000000000001," They were they were try to be as helpful as possible, but you know at the end of the day"
930.3000000000001,935.1, I that last call just kind of like I was like dude why talking to me like I'm who's talking like I was the guy who puts the
935.26,938.0600000000001, Coffee cup inside the city around thinking it's a cup older
939.1800000000001,940.86, That's the
940.86,942.86, There though I guess I guess
942.86,944.86," Wait, isn't the lowest coming"
944.86,948.46, But I think you're I mean you figured on the XPS line it's gonna be like that the more leaps
948.46,951.66, Oftentimes they're reading from a script right?
951.66,955.9," Yeah, you tell them you specified nature of your problem and they flick flip to that page in the handbook"
955.98,958.4599999999999," Yeah, and all that's got instructions for you know and also"
959.1,962.38, The two-joder adventure and the other thing is this was kind of a gray area too because
963.26,966.54, Because this really is a whole new kind of area for for Dell like I bought it
966.54,968.54," I mean, rather I have for for review"
968.54,972.9399999999999, It was strictly the case and it wasn't like they provided the OS or any like that
972.9399999999999,978.06, I had to basically put it together myself and they kind of falls in between the gray area of what Microsoft covers and what Dell covers
978.38,980.06," Yeah, I bought an XPS"
980.06,984.78, No book just for my home use and I and I had to call text support right after I bought it
985.18,990.06, And they were I actually was really impressed you know with the whole XPS personal
990.62,996.6999999999999," Service, you know like they assigned one person to me and she followed up, you know the next day she called me back"
996.6999999999999,1000.86," Wait, you see I think you have to wait for an hour either on the foot of the answer to right away"
1000.86,1005.9," Yeah, I think it might be one of this might be one of those in between areas. There's probably shot iron out the bugs on because really"
1006.22,1011.42, Like Dell is kind of experimenting with this whole idea if you can order as much or as little as you want on there on the right
1011.42,1013.1, Right and this is kind of like where the
1013.26,1017.5, There were some get lost in the cracks. I don't know oh and I have to give a quick shout out
1017.5,1020.94," I forgot to do this last week, but this is awesome free where at retro gaming dot org"
1021.4200000000001,1026.3, They're having these competitions to recreate classic games with a modern twist so like discs of tron
1026.46,1031.58, The old star wars vector graphics arcade game all that stuff so check it out retro gaming dot org
1032.3,1035.26, Maybe I quite a few on there right there and just made five dollars for a fan
1035.26,1037.26, That's it's made
1037.26,1039.26, Nice
1039.26,1042.78, Sean Elliott. I'm still in demo land and
1044.06,1048.4599999999998," Get on the faces of Warren a minute, but first some more about call of war is which I mentioned last week"
1048.4599999999998,1055.02, Where is the amazing thing about this game is and as you know it's a first person shooter set in the wild west
1055.02,1058.78," Is it made it right now or is it no it's a demo. It's actually a demo. Oh, great. Yeah"
1059.74,1066.6999999999998, The hilarious thing is I mean for one the name what what the hell is the call of war is other than like listing next to call of duty in the in the or in the
1067.1,1068.54, section of store you know
1068.54,1071.1," Yeah, I didn't even what is what as far as call out you know"
1071.1799999999998,1073.1799999999998, I don't know anyway
1075.1799999999998,1079.02, Actually one bit of I don't if you realize this so you know it's out in Europe now or yeah
1079.02,1083.6599999999999, And the funny thing is they actually decided to delay it here in the states right it's got to be out because of people
1084.1399999999999,1090.06, Playing the demo have access only to two classes and then to two weapons sets one on you see people other people come in with a full
1090.06,1093.4199999999998, You know a sort of you know character classes and stuff but anyway
1093.98,1099.26, This game the part that's cracking me up. It's funny because it's basically like cowboy counterstrike or something
1099.26,1103.98," Really the multiplayer is really straightforward as it gets, but it's like oddly compelling because there's no"
1104.78,1108.94, I don't know there's no punishment for team killing and stuff and you just go war as on everyone
1110.14,1115.58, But is that now loaded with hacks already and it's a demo. It's like how reassured me it's like backfarned
1115.58,1120.06, It's like hey by this game because the demos already out in the very day the demo drop
1120.06,1124.22, We've already got hackers in here and there's only that there's a whole hacking griefing clan
1124.7,1128.86," I forget their tag but I mean, I've got this crap where they basically push a button"
1129.26,1134.78, Fault pass through the floor and underneath the map or they can they've got a super high jump so they can jump up and then on the descent
1134.78,1138.54, They can press their sort of phase button and go through buildings
1138.7,1142.54, But on the upside whenever they're inside of a building or beneath the map on the floor
1142.54,1147.82, They can still shoot a chew and it will hit you their shots will connect so immediately they phase down
1147.82,1151.42, We tried to team kill them from the beginning. You know we spin around and and aim for them and
1152.3799999999999,1157.06, Start start using auto commands like I see them some of each I see them some of each like that's actually
1157.1399999999999,1161.3, You press V you know four three and you you can see that's one of their built in yeah
1161.3,1165.6599999999999," Yeah, yeah, it's all it's all stuff like that because it's basically like Mexicans versus Native Americans"
1165.6599999999999,1169.7," So depending on which side you're on and anyway, there's no white men in this"
1170.34,1175.86, There are a couple that looked that way but the audio doesn't audio doesn't really reflect that
1177.22,1179.22, So it's not like so
1179.22,1183.86," But anyway, once they pass through the ground they immediately kill off all their teammates and then just go around the map"
1183.86,1187.86, You'll see them sometimes fly up and then you'll see them up in the mountains that are supposed to be surrounding
1188.02,1190.82, Because instead of a skybox to create the illusion of a background
1190.82,1194.8999999999999, It's an actual geometry that you just as know that is like the wild less to tell
1195.9399999999998,1201.26, You see like why are you trying once upon a time and trying to part three gently up in the hills like
1205.54,1208.4199999999998, That was hilarious just because it's like like again
1208.74,1211.2199999999998, Here's the demo and here's why you need to get this game
1211.22,1213.22," Yeah, Mad Hacks"
1214.34,1217.34, Test your hacks the single player game is with anything like guns
1217.34,1221.9," I haven't even played it since the E3. Yeah, I played it early. I played the same built"
1221.9,1224.58, Is there any relation to Activision's gun or no?
1224.58,1229.7, What a different experience. No straight up a first person shooter. This is developed in what Poland Poland by
1230.74,1235.9, Techland right guys. The techland is that's all all the servers like the best paying you can help for is like
1235.9,1239.18, 190 because all the servers are hosted then in Poland or whatever and
1240.7,1245.46," Not so many of my players on there, but it seems really popular among Germans and Austrians which are on there a lot"
1245.46,1249.8000000000002," Really a star for entertainment right now, I guess yeah, and then on the upside also by"
1250.18,1256.9, Published by Ubisoft as faces of war and it's a tag. It's a real-time tactic scheme and I just kind of grabbed it like
1256.9,1261.74," Yeah, something what see what it is and I totally like fall in love with it. I'm really digging this game"
1261.74,1266.72, Now this is the game that it's the sequel to soldiers heroes of World War II that get from code masters a couple years back
1266.72,1269.72," Yeah, and got a name change, but"
1270.28,1274.22, I mean this but especially easy that like over look right now because you know all the world war two
1274.86,1277.74, Top down the used stuff the tension center on company heroes
1278.22,1281.66, But you play this and it's like you can take direct control of an individual unit
1281.66,1286.78," So you know you can drive a tank in a second action game, but you still have your unit following you if you grouped them with them"
1287.78,1290.3799999999999, And you just you don't have to worry about resources
1290.3799999999999,1294.7, You know you have it's all based on time and it fixed a lot meant and you just spawn in what you need
1294.7,1299.46, You know as you know as you're able to get it in set it up the way you want and then let the tactics play from there
1299.62,1305.8999999999999, So it's massively dependent upon micromanagement and I like I'm just totally getting into all these new genres now
1305.8999999999999,1308.3," So I mean it's got that stigma, but for me"
1308.3,1312.22, I'm like who would normally be averse to anything overly complex in this type of game
1312.22,1316.8600000000001, It's like it's fine because you never have that many units and because you can actually control each one
1316.8600000000001,1321.42, Maybe they're learning from last time it got a little unwieldy and like and especially the AI was a little busted
1321.42,1324.14, So like let's say you had to like take direct control of a dude in a tank
1324.14,1328.14," Yeah, the rest of your squad was just kind of sitting there like waiting out me open and get shot or like the right"
1328.14,1333.6200000000001," Like yeah, you had to really micromanage everything and better on their own their problem is path finding you know that"
1333.6200000000001,1334.98, That all right
1334.98,1335.98, All right
1335.98,1339.48," Yes, right because in this game everything in the environments destructible"
1340.0,1344.56, Buildings trees and everything and they always take the path of most resistant
1344.56,1350.56, But that's like a direct line to where you click so instead of like going through the the road or the gateway between two
1350.84,1356.04, Factories they'll just go through the factory themselves just bust through the walls and everything as opposed to
1356.04,1360.2," Company heroes that would actually try to like yeah, the path finding company here is as excellent in that way"
1360.2,1362.1200000000001, I mean it will totally get it down right
1362.1200000000001,1368.96," But despite all that it's still fun because it's like just when you switch to that like independent control and the tank rush, you know"
1369.48,1373.16," Machine gun, you know go to the machine gun on the guy in the back or whatever take out a few guys"
1373.32,1376.08, Then you see in artillery shells skips off the top of the tank
1376.08,1377.88, It's all real physics and stuff like coming here
1377.88,1385.4, It's like you know blast that guy's head off and then you go back to the main turret use that switch over to direct control of artillery drop a few like you know
1385.4,1391.24, Precision surgical strikes with artillery and switch to the bazooka guys on the side and use their rockets
1391.24,1396.92," I mean it's a lot of like said a lot of micromanagement direct control, but I'm totally enjoying it so far and then plus it's got"
1397.72,1399.72, The Soviets and the Americans so
1400.64,1406.0," It's you know, let's got it's got a lot more to the campaign. I'm I'm suspecting been the other game and"
1406.3200000000002,1411.68, Just tons of little stuff you know it's like even hooking up your I mean it correct me if this is just a standard in games
1411.68,1416.8000000000002, But you know you hook up your artillery to your trucks or your tanks and drive it around if you want throw your guys on the back of the tanks
1416.8000000000002,1417.7, Have them getting the
1417.98,1424.24, Getting the storage bins and pull out you know repair kids and dynamite to do you know all this little little crap with and well
1424.24,1428.36, That was one of the cool things I have with the last game right. They kind of they broke forward. I'm just new to it
1428.36,1432.0, But they're pretty cool like and I recommend that people try the demo at least
1433.2,1437.44, It's kind of a shame that it's just it's obviously it's just going to get completely dwarfed
1437.44,1440.44, It's not no one's going to be noticed it with company heroes out at the same time
1440.44,1442.68," Yeah, it's kind of well, I mean it's coming out this week, right?"
1442.68,1446.08," Yeah, it's supposed to be out tomorrow. I think yeah, they're gonna they get to me a rough one"
1446.08,1450.08, But I don't know maybe the fight on the bargain bins or something or it's worth checking out
1450.08,1453.4399999999998," I'll consider that a recommendation. Maybe we'll make a few sales. Yeah, it's fun"
1453.4399999999998,1455.4399999999998, I'm playing online with this. I
1455.4399999999998,1462.48, The last game of the CGW forum is we get games going pick up games known then back back when we way back in the golden days when we actually still scored
1462.48,1468.8," That get the last one got four out of five so cool. What did it? Yeah, I'm definitely excited like I should"
1468.8,1470.96, I should clarify too that not even just like hey
1470.96,1473.1999999999998, This is kind of fun because I didn't expect it to be fun
1473.1999999999998,1478.36, Like I actually went to bed thinking about what I was gonna try the next time I played it in the morning when I woke up
1478.36,1481.4799999999998, So that's pretty good. That's a very good sign
1483.4799999999998,1487.12, Mr. Maloy you can probably just cut and paste the last
1487.84,1493.4199999999998, I mean in 27 guys got a lot of games now. It's tough when you get sucked into that wow vortex
1493.4199999999998,1498.8," It's it's hard to get out. Yeah, you know you feel like any any any time you're playing another game"
1498.8,1503.76, You're wasting time where you could be doing this or that in wow that's how it was it's very battlefield
1503.76,1508.08, It was good when like I finally got to the point where I'm like it just kind of naturally happened in the now
1508.08,1510.08, I'm like trying everything I can
1510.08,1514.8, Well that I mean I'm sure that happened with you with wow right Sean I mean I'm sure it happened before right
1514.8,1518.8799999999999, It has a steep first time that I've been addicted right I mean you go through phases
1518.8799999999999,1520.72, I am getting completely burned out
1520.72,1525.36, So what are you addicted to now? Are you is it a new group of people you're playing it's the new guild
1525.36,1530.96, I'm in like I finally found a guild that like I enjoy playing with them like the rate experiences are total nightmares
1531.04,1537.2, So is it more like because you feel like a devotion like a soldier in the alliance or amy kind of thing or are you just cut or is it hard?
1537.8400000000001,1539.8400000000001," Alliance okay, good"
1539.8400000000001,1542.24," I'm just good, but actually not actually because it's not I have someone to kill"
1543.68,1545.68, For the hard
1546.4,1548.4," Yeah, no it's"
1548.4,1553.28, Right now I guess it's just the the whole rating thing is just really got my attention because the I don't know
1553.28,1558.64, I just found the boss battles and this the coordination going on fascinating and it's really interesting because they're like a
1558.8000000000002,1563.0400000000002, Very went the later dungeon raid battles are like so carefully orchestrated that
1563.6000000000001,1568.96, There's so many like need ideas going on and just like it's pretty phenomenal how how long does fighting the boss take?
1569.5200000000002,1574.72," One of the bosses can take like 10 minutes. Okay, that's fine. I thought you're gonna say like an hour"
1574.72,1576.72, But it's not the yard
1576.96,1583.76," You go well a whole raid dungeon, which is like molten core for example is a series of like nine ten bosses. I can't be a ten nine"
1584.56,1590.16, But the each take like ten minutes plus there's like ten minutes of travel time in between
1590.56,1592.16," Yeah, whatever that is"
1592.16,1596.48, That's a bit of a stop. You're not sitting there wailing away on the same dumbass dragon for no
1596.48,1599.6," You know, you know, you know the like is every mistake"
1599.6,1604.24," Yeah, like a 15 minute experience you like I'll gather up your like our let's go in and then like ten minutes"
1604.24,1606.0, She's down and you leave yeah
1606.8,1610.8, The raid itself is long but the bosses they have enough variety and they
1611.36,1614.24, You know you're traveling doing doing all the time and they all have like their unhooks and stuff
1614.6399999999999,1620.56, And I have like mad props to the people who figured this stuff out because like when you go in you got a like study your role
1621.2,1626.48," Okay, if I screw this up then like you know the whole raid's gonna blame me so someone"
1627.04,1629.04, Some guild had to go and like
1630.24,1636.72, Figure everything out like what all 40 people in the raid need to be doing and like what the bosses is really doing and like
1637.68,1639.68, I'm thinking that's crazy
1640.8,1642.8, Bring it Ralph you back to comment on that
1647.04,1650.6399999999999," Yeah, you go bring them in here. Yeah, I mean a me tongue ass on a question like how"
1651.36,1658.24," You know, have you ever had it where like people there if they're venom and like fights in your guild because someone did mess it up and someone like blame them"
1658.24,1661.12, And they were ready to do it. They're ready to rocket jam at that night
1661.9199999999998,1667.84," Someone had to go and screw it all up. Oh, that's what they leave our Jenkins thing is all about right? I mean, it was a guy right"
1668.08,1674.6399999999999," Right, so I mean you have that housing the solid spirit. What do I mean? Where they're there where they're legitimately mad into the point where it's like"
1674.6399999999999,1678.56, You know how people get like maybe you don't but like arguing over like fantasy football and crap
1678.56,1681.9199999999998, You know they start like those don't pick man. You just don't have any game
1682.1599999999999,1685.6, They just get so personal after that you got a god-complet it hasn't gotten
1685.6,1688.6399999999999, I'm talking not from personal experience before from an anecdote that I
1689.84,1694.0, Haven't had any like I haven't experienced anything too horrible a little bit like last week
1694.32,1698.32, We're in the final boss of molten core. Would you beat in a few times and like we didn't
1698.4,1702.48, Bring him down for a number of reasons we all had their own like we should have had more you know
1702.48,1707.76, DPS classes or whatever the raid later kind of flipped out and he's like it's cuz you guys didn't end up fire was just gear
1707.76,1710.88, You need to get fire was this gear next by right over
1710.88,1712.08," No, it's like I"
1714.08,1716.08, Is like it would have happened
1716.08,1718.08, That you do not just step away and go
1718.56,1719.76, Who the hell is this?
1719.76,1720.56," Yeah, it's on teams"
1721.52,1727.04," This is typed so you kind of okay, you kind of apply your own tone of voice you can hear it is 11 year old voice"
1727.04,1735.28," Well, it's it's a well- I don't know how in force this is but I'm pretty sure it's pretty in force is 18 and over only in this one"
1735.28,1741.2, Which is why the last guild sucked but like at least you have like you're pretty sure
1741.76,1746.56, What's well you suspect someone's not so you're pretty sure you're all you're playing with the quote adults unquote
1747.04,1748.3999999999999, But
1748.4,1754.96, I don't know did that like I said like I think that's a big part of why I've stick around with this one because that the meltdowns and the weird stupid
1754.96,1759.2800000000002, Crits and tapping that off and and even when things do go wrong most of the time people laugh about it
1759.76,1764.3200000000002, So it is true though that it's hard when you're playing this to like play all the new stuff
1764.4,1769.0400000000002, I mean it really is I have to make myself stop while for a while and then play all the new things
1769.44,1773.2, I'm kind of just like waiting because all these like company peruses
1773.2,1777.92," So when I think I'm most anxious. Yeah, Thursday comes out right wait to watch a mile"
1778.48,1780.4," Yeah, it's gotta be soon it's gonna be the one"
1780.4,1784.5600000000002," Someone who actually went to work for today. So yeah, can't wait empty hand"
1786.72,1788.72," Okay, so"
1788.72,1790.72, We let's let's move on
1790.72,1796.96," Oh, uh, break break. Okay. Now that we've gone through what you plan it's taking us longer and longer every week to get past us part"
1796.96,1798.96," Anyway, no"
1798.96,1801.8400000000001, It's good stuff. It's like up to the minute you know commentary
1801.8400000000001,1805.2," No, it's important and that's cool too because you know I mean we've got like in the viewpoint"
1805.28,1807.2, We've got the more measured you know
1807.44,1813.1200000000001, Studied response to the games after we've had time to play them and here's a good chance for us to like stay up to date and just yep
1813.1200000000001,1816.8, You know whatever just be in touch with the top of the you know top of the head right
1818.16,1821.28, But when we come back we'll get on to all the next topics
1822.48,1826.0800000000002, On our agenda for this week will be right back now right
1827.44,1831.68, Is this where we just be quiet and pretend it's in that or do we just this is where we stop talking for five
1831.68,1836.0," Actually, I'm making that all right, so we're gonna try that again. No, let go"
1836.0,1839.1200000000001," Okay, I was deliberate. I was trying to make a joke there. Okay, okay"
1839.1200000000001,1844.16," It's the way we're back and we're not back yet. Okay, now we'll be back in a minute"

1901.6,1906.8799999999999," Okay, so I think this thing went up today. Didn't Darren this thing up from this analyst moron"
1907.9199999999998,1909.9199999999998, I just stop saying that you might be a
1909.92,1915.6000000000001, Mr. Packer I've great respect for you and you're analysis infinite respect. I'm just kidding you a master of your domain
1916.16,1921.2, So Darren once you explain that to the folks out there and the listening audience what this item is about
1921.2,1924.88, All right Michael Packer who's a he's a gaming analyst at wed bush Morgan securities
1924.88,1927.52, He said this and a gama suture article recently
1928.16,1932.72, The PC game is market is becoming a niche substantial inside this but a niche nonetheless
1934.4,1939.68, There will always be PC games and the MMOs are likely going to remain PC based because of the required internet
1940.16,1941.68, Because you know consoles aren't
1942.24,1947.8400000000001, There are also games that just make sense for on a PC like RPG RTS and you know puzzle games
1948.5600000000002,1953.44," Well, you know thanks for dismissing our major audience. I major audience as you know totally"
1954.0,1956.0, Great good job buddy. Well
1956.88,1958.88, It's interesting. I mean
1958.88,1963.8400000000001, First of all how do you become a gaming analyst? That's one thing. I want to know that seems like a good job
1963.8400000000001,1965.8400000000001, That's a good great. I you know what I could do
1966.32,1968.32, Wait we are
1968.32,1971.76, We just don't get paid enough. Right. Well he might not either
1973.12,1975.12, I don't know how wrong
1975.12,1977.76, He I think is his phrasing is terrible
1978.0,1980.24, But I'm not sure if he's wrong wrong
1980.72,1985.36, I mean it is a niche to some extent. I don't net doesn't necessarily have to be
1987.1999999999998,1989.1999999999998, But he's saying it's becoming an hp bad thing
1989.52,1992.48," But yeah, becoming a niche substantial in size, but in its non-life"
1992.48,1995.36," I mean, I think it's it is it's a segment of gaming"
1995.9199999999998,1997.9199999999998, Maybe I may be I'm over
1998.56,1999.9199999999998, You know
1999.9199999999998,2006.32, It doesn't I don't know well I guess my my big beef of it is that he's making this assumption that like you know
2006.32,2008.32, It's just the territory of
2009.04,2013.6, You know art like I'm gonna play an MMO RPG and that's it. I mean
2013.6,2017.9199999999998, So then MMO RPG RTS puzzle games. I mean that's a lot of games
2017.9199999999998,2019.12, Yeah
2019.12,2023.76, Because no one's going to want to play crisis no one's right because he did leave out shooter
2023.84,2030.08, Let's get no one's going to play a first person shooter on the PC of course right sport is only coming to the PC as it as of right now
2030.24,2032.64," So yeah, no one's playing PC games"
2033.84,2041.76, Does he even like look at the NPD listings where like the sims is still coming in like number two in sales like years later right
2042.48,2043.68, I mean
2043.68,2045.2, I don't know I think you it's like
2047.28,2049.04, You've got all the all the consoles
2049.68,2056.96, If you just like take away this the numbers involved. I mean really PC gaming is a separate thing right you've got Nintendo
2058.8,2062.4, PlayStation and Xbox all basically fighting over the same
2063.44,2065.44, Crowd and all all
2066.0,2070.24, Representing a certain type of experience which is playing games in front of your tell-through all though
2070.24,2074.0, To stick clarify that Nintendo would insist that they're fighting for a different crowd now
2074.48,2078.64," Well, okay, let's not say the same crowd, but that's the same gaming experience right?"
2078.64,2085.04, It's the same thing. It's a new topic software are going ahead right where is the PC is sort of its own different thing?
2085.04,2088.16," I mean, I'm I'm willing to say that it's not you know we don't"
2088.8,2093.12, We're not going head to head with those guys and we don't need to it is a separate experience
2093.12,2096.08, I think I think it's a big thing. I think it's complimentary. I think it's own words. Yeah
2096.08,2101.6, I got a contradict each other because to me a niche means not substantial in size so he's well right
2101.92,2106.92," It's a niche but it's a really big niche so that means well, and it's you know then it's not"
2107.92,2112.24, substantial niche. I don't think it's an oxymoron because like furries probably a substantial niche
2113.68,2117.04, Like that you know look at look at stuff like glycic civilizations
2118.08,2121.44," Yeah, you call that a niche, but there's a hell of a lot of people who play those games"
2122.16,2124.4," Yeah, he just look on their forums like the number of"
2125.44,2128.3199999999997, I don't know what what what do you think listener?
2128.8,2133.44, Let us know on our on our bars. I'd be curious what you think is that a bad thing first of all are we in niche
2133.44,2134.1600000000003, I
2134.1600000000003,2137.92, I bet I should show you me and I'm just like because I think the automatic reaction for us would be like
2138.8,2140.88," Damn this guy, you know like what I'm saying"
2141.6000000000004,2145.6000000000004, We kind of are because they will write that's it by how many people do you know that even
2146.0,2150.0, No half of the crap that go into our PCs to even let us play these games
2150.32,2153.04," Come back or do they know that you know? I mean, they know about Xbox and stuff"
2153.04,2154.8, But it's like honestly think like you know
2155.1200000000003,2159.36, I tried to tell Melissa why I was gonna go over to Darren's to get another computer and we have two right now
2159.36,2161.36, I said why do you need another one?
2161.36,2163.36, Like because it's better
2163.36,2165.1200000000003," It just doesn't compute you know, it's like it"
2165.1200000000003,2171.28, I think I think part of the problem is right now and actually I'm gonna do a shameless plug for our upcoming issue where I interviewed Mark Rain
2171.84,2175.04, And he he expand expand on this at length
2175.04,2177.2000000000003," Yeah, I think he would agree that it's niche. I think well"
2177.84,2182.0," He would say that it's it's niche right now, but has a lot of potential to grow and I think part of that is"
2182.48,2186.88, The way he puts it is you go like Joe consumer who goes out and buys a computer right now
2187.04,2190.24, They can buy an 800 P.C. that has a dual core CPU
2190.56,2195.36, But the integrated graphics and that thing can't support doing the three at at at at 60 frames per second
2196.24,2201.92," So you know, there's obviously a disconnect. They focus so much on the integrated graphics can support wall to work"
2202.72,2206.96," So yeah, it's a great so that's perpetuating the MMO myth, but not you know"
2207.52,2213.44, So but the general idea is if you can have an 800 LPC according to Mark Rain at least he says that you
2213.76,2219.2, It'll cost them five dollars per board if they just throw in enough enough horsepower behind the integrated graphics solution
2219.68,2224.64, So that you can plug in a monitor and you can expect to get at least a certain base level of good performance from the get-go
2225.2,2227.44, And I think that's part of it is like you know
2227.44,2234.32, We have like it's kind of weird because they still try to I mean they still try to advertise themselves like when you get those kind of computers as like
2234.32,2238.2400000000002," Yes, you can you know on the it's always pretty big on the bullet points of what you get out of it"
2238.2400000000002,2242.0," You could play games and stuff. Yeah, they don't just like it just doesn't tell you what you can play"
2242.0,2243.36, You know popcapped games
2243.36,2250.1600000000003," Exactly, I think that's part of the problem is like the expectations of someone as they they I just spent a thousand plus"
2250.1600000000003,2254.2400000000002, So however many dollars on any computer right why why is that I got to spend more
2254.8,2257.36, So I mean integrated graphics could be a possibility
2257.44,2261.6800000000003, You know way for that to work and I think with the merger with ATINM AMD
2262.08,2264.3199999999997, There's a possibility of like they could sell that to
2265.68,2272.3999999999996," Board manufacturers and so okay, you're gonna have a computer that's gonna work in a certain base level at least as good as a 360 right"
2273.8399999999997,2278.0, So I don't know maybe maybe it's definitely in a crossroads
2278.0,2284.48, I think that there's a chance that you know it could swing in our in piece of gaming's favor of like getting you know
2284.96,2286.48, More more people in on it. I
2286.72,2290.32, I just find that I find them to be very complimentary
2291.04,2294.64, Past times as somebody maybe Ryan you you mumbled that a few minutes ago
2294.64,2301.2," I forget somebody that was you yeah, I feel there's a place for both. I mean we we've said this many times on this podcast"
2301.2,2305.36, Most of us in the sort of all have all the machines. I got them all PC and constantly
2305.36,2307.6," That's why we you know, it's in the 360 kind of ridiculous"
2307.6,2313.36," It's a good one. We're a gamer nation. Yeah, it's very very agnostic care. So I'd I sort of hate that old"
2313.6800000000003,2318.8, Consul versus PC war. I never sort of irrelevant to to us it just depends on the experience you want
2318.8,2323.2000000000003, I mean like that quick you was you want to play something when a big screen TV or just be right in right up in the action
2323.2000000000003,2329.76, That's all I would I would never play a game like wow or whatever on a console and I would never play like Zelda on a PC
2330.48,2335.36," Right even if they were all available, you know, you know, I'll be platform. That's just instinctively"
2335.84,2338.48," Yeah, and that's kind of the point right"
2340.0,2341.52," Okay, so we all agree"
2341.52,2343.52, That's beautiful. I have to wonder if you can
2345.52,2348.96, I have to wonder if these analysts really even play a lot of games
2349.7599999999998,2352.24, Some guys just like they're paid to predict the future
2353.6,2358.8, You know what what even they wave their doubts a rod over the computer and just kind of figure out what's gonna happen next?
2359.2,2361.2," Yeah, so kind of like us"
2363.2,2365.2, So so the Islamo gaming
2366.16,2370.08, I don't like to be one of those podcasts where we just sort of plug our own magazine
2370.08,2375.2, So that's not really what this is about but in the September issue we wrote a story on
2376.56,2379.12, On games being I don't know what's wrong with my threat today. I'm sorry
2379.7599999999998,2381.7599999999998, I apologize to everybody else because I keep going
2382.64,2385.6, the whole time but we wrote a feature on
2386.72,2388.72, on
2388.72,2390.72, Sean Ali's looking at the porn ads again
2391.68,2393.68, I think I think
2395.68,2397.68, You're in section
2401.68,2403.68," Sean, we'll be back in 10 minutes"
2405.68,2409.7599999999998," Yeah, but that's a 19 you can probably I'll be some of these names. This is what about to get serious with this long"
2409.7599999999998,2410.7999999999997," Again, right"
2410.7999999999997,2415.7599999999998, So we wrote a piece that was actually written by a regular writer for the village voice
2416.7200000000003,2418.0800000000004, on
2418.0800000000004,2421.44, the phenomenon of games we made by Islamic groups and
2423.0400000000004,2426.2400000000002, We had no agenda with this piece the piece was just
2428.7200000000003,2435.6800000000003, Information it was letting people know that this phenomenon existed out in the world that was the point that's often the point of magazine articles
2436.1600000000003,2441.2000000000003, Is to you know talk about stuff you maybe never heard of and and inform
2441.6000000000004,2443.6000000000004, So that that's what this feature was
2444.24,2450.56, But the mail's been running hot and cold of course on this piece what with a lot of very knee jerk
2451.04,2455.8399999999997, That we had taken a certain stand by even publishing this thing at all. We were we were somehow
2456.56,2463.6, Taking aside or making some kind of political in that that I wonder if it's almost just the place where we're at
2463.92,2466.48, In terms of writing about games because I think like if you grabbed
2467.04,2473.2799999999997, You know whatever vanity fair something you read a story about you know to run you're not going to immediately assume that because they're turning
2473.36,2479.1200000000003, Their gaze in that direction that they're advocating whatever it is that they're going to discuss and you know the pages that follow
2479.36,2485.28, Whereas for in game stuff it so so much of the time and and and and in most people's experience when you grab a game
2485.28,2487.92, I'm saying if something's in there and it's not a review it's pretty much
2488.4,2492.8, You know advocating it in some way right you know saying like this is worth your attention
2492.8,2496.6400000000003, This is you know usually because this is cooler. This is something then that we sit with but
2497.28,2502.48, There's really I mean well that one letter of criticism we got a week or so go where the guy was saying like
2502.8,2507.68, You know you don't even not only was it lousy but like you didn't even say like where to get these games
2508.16,2512.48, You know it's like well that was the point in the article it wasn't a pretty good preview
2512.88,2516.44," Yeah, but it just sort of was beyond him that we'd even we would even run and all right"
2516.44,2522.08, But it wasn't a preview or review the cool thing about it when I decided to chase it and you know approach you know
2522.08,2527.6," At halter about it was that not only is it you know, but because you just don't think of it and you don't think of it and"
2527.6,2529.84," You don't think of the middle east in those terms and like okay, now I'm with you know"
2529.84,2530.8, They have
2530.88,2536.0," Quite a few different games, but then when you do look at them it's interesting regardless like well, what's going on in them?"
2536.0,2542.4, You know and then like immediately some people you know wanted to look and then certainly they were vindicated by what they found that they are
2542.48,2547.2400000000002," Basically sort of agenda tools, you know, that's it that they were training you know"
2547.2400000000002,2550.96, Either you know decent sizing whatever they were real rallying cries for eams and that was true
2551.28,2557.44, At the same time though as I thought what I thought found interesting about it and reading some of Ed's work elsewhere
2558.6400000000003,2560.6400000000003, Is that as you look at it
2560.72,2568.72, And as you made that call is this you know is this stuff just completely obnoxious is this horrendous is is this basically tears training tools or what or is there something more to it
2568.72,2573.68," I found myself saying well, you know, how does it compare to American stuff?"
2573.68,2579.2," Which I'm clearly behind totally avid war gamer, you know and consume you know American made in European made war games and"
2579.68,2583.9, And just just in the I mean even when you try to strip out the politics and say hey basically
2583.9,2590.48," It's just some made up war, but the two teams happen to be it just happens to be that the guys are wiping out or this or that"
2590.64,2595.2," Or the other you know, but then when you flip it it's weird it just it just kind of exposes your"
2595.8399999999997,2602.24, Your biases next which turns you know and you're like wow and you find like if you find yourself immediately offended by the notion that Americans
2602.24,2607.04, I mean killed in it which you I think we all rightfully do it just but it just reminds you that you know
2607.04,2610.96," Hey, how do you think they might this is how they're seeing it whether they're right or wrong seeing it?"
2610.96,2614.48, This is how they're doing it. You know when we ask all these questions or about you know
2614.64,2618.64, Why do people do the things they do? I think perceptions key so I think it honestly
2618.64,2622.72, I wonder how all these World War II games go over in Germany
2622.72,2626.96, That's the one that all the time you know the Nazis are never the good guys
2627.52,2632.24, You know the misunderstood I mean that's got the benefit of being you know historicized I mean
2632.24,2637.8399999999997, It's not like a yeah future projection like I mean if if we did if if we tended to make it so then about you know
2637.8399999999997,2645.2, What 60% of our games were fighting Germany five years in the future from now and they happen to be not a Nazi state again
2645.68,2651.9199999999996, And that would be even more in San Diary then right and that's kind of like what because basically all these games are coming out of here
2651.9199999999996,2656.7999999999997, You know are they're America at least they're they're setting career in Venezuela and all these places and stuff and they totally
2656.7999999999997,2661.9199999999996," You know for all these reasons we can say it makes sense, but at the same time just acknowledging that well"
2661.9199999999996,2667.12, If you're depending on where you're living it might not make as much sense as quickly to someone else that does to us
2669.12,2671.8399999999997," Yeah, not yeah, and and I"
2672.0,2673.84, So and I'll say as to about you know
2674.0,2680.76, In our I think I read or male in this list about other sorts of stories like that that we want to pursue and I find it interesting everywhere
2680.76,2682.76," It's not just the the terrorism slide, but"
2683.6000000000004,2688.1600000000003," Well, we get to know now put it in a whole lot on China right and massively interesting Korea"
2688.1600000000003,2694.6400000000003, I mean the Eastern block I mean we're gonna turn I think we're gonna turn you know and and do some stuff on all these areas
2694.6400000000003,2699.32," So yeah, actually there's one thing I've ever wanted to check out this in in in Russia"
2699.32,2706.38, Well form like you know in Moscow or either there is this former KGB office that's now being used as a testing center for
2706.6400000000003,2710.84," For games. Oh, you shouldn't have said that on the air. Oh, you're so dead now"
2712.6000000000004,2719.56," They're listening down. I think we should just go back to tips and tricks article. Yeah, that's a scare. Yeah, but that's like I mean"
2719.56,2723.1200000000003, I think the fact that it's getting where's it when you do a story that gets
2723.92,2728.7, Responses of that you know variety and in and that kind of passion
2728.7,2730.94, This is we're doing something right it was very cool
2730.94,2732.94, That thought that we got picked up by Fox News
2733.18,2735.16," Yeah, whatever you think about Fox News"
2735.16,2737.8399999999997, I mean the fact that we were on the radar that way and look at this
2737.8399999999997,2739.68, We didn't credit us when we were right of course
2739.68,2742.48, I got credited to extreme tech yeah in fact
2742.48,2747.74, They did not do that article. It was computer game real. Thank you very little and when we get the letters of guys
2747.74,2749.54, You just tied your heart into your
2749.54,2754.4, Finding the court of my mic that was something bad was gonna happen
2754.4,2757.7799999999997, I'm sorry. So I say what we got like the letter that we got today
2757.7799999999997,2762.44," We can't talk about because the letter writer copyrighted his letter. Yes, so while we're not gonna quote"
2762.44,2767.42, I think you talk about it. It's not it's in our legal right to it to explain that we received the letter. Yes it is
2768.74,2771.46, You he was basically saying that the whole thing was pro
2771.9,2773.18, Whatever pro
2773.18,2780.08," Mozji hot is your whatever, you know, yeah and and but the but it Fox news not necessarily known for being"
2780.08,2786.66, You know having a liberal slander anything is gonna pick it up and and reprint it word for word and it's it wasn't like an incendiary thing
2786.66,2788.66, It wasn't like a
2788.66,2793.52, So an editorializing and say hey can you believe that these guys wrote this thing they just put it and if they were doing that
2793.52,2797.7799999999997, They were pretty confident that their readers whose expectations are probably you know
2797.78,2804.2200000000003, Guess or are more conservative than not the may were confident enough in its impartiality to do right
2804.2200000000003,2811.5," In fact, it would be fair enough to read that piece that we wrote and and be"
2813.0600000000004,2819.0400000000004, Angry that these games existed the end we should put but you shouldn't be angry at those who wrote the story
2819.0400000000004,2827.42, But letting you know that it's there it'd be cool to take it point if you had to find some liberal friend and point them to the story on the Fox news site
2827.42,2833.26," And have read it if it didn't have the extreme table, well, but that's true and then let them read it say hey is this is this bias"
2833.42,2836.62," Conservative and see if they're more likely me do like some kind of poll, you know"
2836.98,2842.92, People you know liberal readers that read it in this context thought it was more likely to be conservative and then you know conservative readers
2842.92,2844.92, That read it in our context thought it's more likely to be liberal
2845.54,2848.54, This is why Sean the line I are happier in Azeroth
2850.1,2854.7000000000003," It's just a happier nicer place there, but it's not like really worried about it. It's K.P"
2854.7,2859.7799999999997, But it's but isn't there recent amongst the trolls in the elves true? I get a lot of crap as they are no
2860.3799999999997,2867.18, You know I like you know I'm like walking down the road in iron forward to whatever and people like will pat my head like
2867.18,2869.66," Hey, excuse me I'm a grown man"
2870.5,2872.5, Ecuador's level 56 pat my head
2874.14,2876.14, I'm sorry
2876.14,2878.14, I'm sorry
2878.14,2880.14, I
2880.14,2884.0, Who are we we're finally in the smart up the magazine
2884.56,2886.56, Sean's back to the porn
2887.2799999999997,2890.3799999999997, I tried to be smart. We were in pure for a minute
2891.18,2897.74," Back to the right. Yeah, it's a good deal. And that did want to assure people that it hopefully enjoyed that kind of thing because we've got a lot more"
2898.62,2904.46, Sort of stuff like that in radar coming up and future issues in C.G.W. and games for Windows. Yeah
2904.46,2906.46, I
2906.46,2909.8199999999997," Seriously, I am very proud of that and I'll go in all the articles we were unlike that"
2909.82,2915.82, And I do hope that some readers out there appreciated at least because Lord knows we've gotten a lot of negative over this one
2916.3,2918.3," For not being American enough, right?"
2918.3,2922.3, But it's happened to I mean when we covered when we covered the uh
2922.86,2927.34," In the story god mode where we covered Christian gaming plans. Yes, just some shins were there as well"
2927.34,2932.46, That we were actually half of the assumptions were that that we were Christians proselytizing in our magazine the other
2932.7400000000002,2934.7400000000002, actually no one accused us of
2935.2999999999997,2941.54," Just ripping these guys, you know, no, but then again, but then when when we ran the story on the gay lesbian guilds in"
2941.62,2947.06," Will the warcraft it was like, you know, you guys are all like all of a sudden you're whatever the rainbow coalition or something"
2947.06,2952.8199999999997," I mean, it's just I think it's just getting people to get to that comfort level where they can see that we're covering these things"
2953.22,2958.1," Right, we're aiming for impartialing that it's just because we're looking at it doesn't mean we're right necessarily"
2958.3399999999997,2962.74," Yeah, with the with the Christian gaming article in fact, most of the letters from"
2963.7,2969.62, Excuse me from Christians or or series believers was was that they were amazed that we were so
2970.02,2974.66," Right, so impartial it was the angry letter sacs he came from the people who wish we had"
2974.66,2978.74," Smack just for the mob, yeah, you know, which of course would have been the easy way out"
2978.8999999999996,2983.14," Right, but as again, it's just said that that we were doing our jobs the right way I think on that sort of thing"
2983.14,2989.06, I mean it pays first to editorialize more playing at game hands on and we can tell you that's we're supposed to be experts on this
2989.54,2991.22, But stuff like that where there's you know
2991.22,2994.2599999999998, We just support it so I think what well what our basic point is we're great
2996.02,2998.02, To some awful
2998.02,3002.98, We love our our dear advancing the arts I would subscribe to us if we didn't write us
3003.2999999999997,3005.2999999999997, If we are editorial lead
3006.2599999999998,3011.06, People will read into things whatever they want indeed and if you're not getting paid mainly not doing your job
3012.1,3013.7, Very true
3013.7,3015.3799999999997, How are we doing on time?
3015.3799999999997,3020.4199999999996," 49 minutes okay, okay, I will pass through out of here. I get it on the train. Oh"
3020.5,3027.14," Sean I just go carry on, but okay, well, Darren I'll I want you to take over and breathe through them as"
3027.7000000000003,3032.42," As you see fit all right this will be going really quick. Okay, so quickly about that xbox 360 no"
3032.42,3036.1, I got it I got to give some Matt props to nerd nerd supreme Ben heck
3036.58,3038.58, He basically created a custom 360
3039.38,3041.38, Portable with a 17 inch display
3042.26,3045.86, Y5 report USB hub a keyboard the whole deal and
3046.5,3052.34, And weighs 14 pounds so I don't know what it's like a it's basically it's it's a portable xbox 360
3052.9,3057.3, It looks like a no thick notebook like a desktop replacement notebook. It's in the 360 heavy though
3057.86,3062.02, It weighs in a 14 pounds it says weighs about 14 pounds the whole thing with the monitor
3062.02,3065.54, So I'm just like you know what that's kind of cool and seriously nerdy way
3066.34,3070.1, I guess on the xbox podcast I can talk about that there you go all right done
3070.82,3072.82, Here's something actually I
3073.1400000000003,3075.1400000000003, Told you be cross over don't you be quick
3076.9,3082.42," Okay, so the let me see so over at I get to read one of these man which one you want to read?"
3082.7400000000002,3086.34," Are you gonna do hayloona? Yeah, I was about to you want to do it. All right. I'll do the first part"
3087.6200000000003,3092.1800000000003, The mod halogen and RTS take on halo is ground to a halt by Microsoft
3092.6600000000003,3097.86, That reading this exactly so don't this has ground to a halt by Microsoft the hell's that dude
3098.42,3100.42, Anyway
3102.82,3106.9, It is mode after work you go to the game for the last three years
3107.54,3108.9, Let's back you know
3108.9,3110.9, Fucking we're fucking weptor over here. Oh
3111.78,3116.5800000000004," So it's the easy on the language yeah, oh man. It's just playing dude my notes"
3117.86,3119.86, I got we got it in this podcast
3119.86,3122.02," Yeah, I got a lucky lucky"
3122.02,3125.54," Okay, okay, I'll be the fire which is I'm trying to make it exciting"
3125.86,3131.1400000000003," It was gonna be that was exciting. We have a close here. I know go ahead John. No, I'm done"
3132.1,3135.7," Wow, oh my there's just dropping F bombs. He's losing it"
3136.42,3138.66, Read my notes make a fun of my huge cring knew
3139.7,3141.7, I just read that I realized that
3141.7,3144.74, Apple more good. We're having a good podcast suddenly it's imploded
3144.74,3146.8199999999997, It's getting like a pot roast. It's making cooking
3146.8199999999997,3148.8199999999997, It was 16 hours
3149.94,3153.3799999999997," Okay, everyone want to take this news item. We just move in on"
3154.98,3156.98," Wow, okay"
3156.98,3159.22," Okay, I'll finish it then. It's basically we got a mod"
3160.18,3165.7799999999997, Called halogen's Nartias take on halo and Microsoft's put the heel on it after uh working on the game for three years
3166.4199999999996,3169.8599999999997, The makers of halogen got a season to sister from bungee on September 8
3170.58,3175.2999999999997," Wow, they worked on it for three years and now Microsoft gave him a season to sister"
3176.5,3179.06, A bungee give me because that was because it was using their IP
3179.4599999999996,3185.2999999999997," It was faithfully it was like we created it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was just were they making a profit on it"
3185.38,3187.46," No, it's just kind of like they're doing their own thing"
3187.86,3192.6600000000003, They wanted to like they love the game. They wanted to make it RTS out of it so they're creating a mod for I think I think it was
3192.98,3199.3," Command and Conquer generals so it's up there with the like well, no, not necessarily I was gonna say the classic cases of American litigation"
3199.3,3202.82, Where you've got Disney's doing it like a home daycare center for having Mickey Mouse
3203.0600000000004,3207.1400000000003, You're all in the wall right but actually in that case you could argue that they are making money off it
3207.1400000000003,3211.1400000000003, But what this actually reminds me of is the old days of PC gaming it seems like the same
3211.3799999999997,3214.42, Crap is starting to come over into the console world because
3214.9,3216.9, in the old days of like
3217.8599999999997,3218.9, the
3218.9,3223.54, You know before before it was all legitimized the map making and the mod making I remember
3224.2599999999998,3227.06, Westwood used to get really upset with people making
3227.7799999999997,3233.94," Command and Conquer maps, you know, they just didn't buy into the whole thing at first people were just we're hacking it and and"
3234.5,3240.5, Making their own mods and maps and Westwood felt like it was money that they should have been making that they were getting ripped off
3241.14,3243.7, You know from people making money off there what year was that?
3244.9,3246.1, 18
3247.06,3249.8599999999997," Because it's like no, yeah, yeah, it seems so long ago like"
3250.9,3256.42," That's well, it's not well, then it's not really that long ago, but like everything that we associate with PC gaming"
3256.66,3259.46, You know now right good stuff about you know being able to have
3260.1,3265.2999999999997," Access to all these mods, well, that's what I'm saying is that like I don't feel like this issue would even be happening on the PC"
3266.18,3270.02, Really that what's happening now with halogen and bungee seems like something
3271.14,3274.66," That wouldn't happen on our platform right it's a video. Well, no, it's just which over"
3274.66,3276.66," Oh, it is just for PC"
3276.66,3281.3799999999997," Yeah, it did make it never mind. I was wondering what you got to make no this is actually yeah, that's why you guys are all looking to me"
3281.3799999999997,3288.58," Well, it's still holds because it's like maybe if it was a PC franchise like if it was half-life say and they made a half-life based RTS"
3288.98,3290.02, That was free
3290.02,3296.1," Yeah, you know, maybe it wouldn't be happening right but because it's got its origins in console land that maybe that's"
3296.66,3300.9," You know, I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm saying as you know if if Microsoft or a bungee had any plans"
3301.14,3305.62, An RTS Halo game find stop it. I mean for me. He's a dude hopefully
3305.62,3308.42," Maybe there's some kind of secret thing in the works, but even if they do though"
3308.42,3313.3799999999997, It's like come on that would be like valve shutting down fortress forever because they decided they're gonna
