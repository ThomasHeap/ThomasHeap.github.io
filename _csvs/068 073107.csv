270.6,271.6," That's, please do."
271.6,276.6," When was the last time any of you have had to deal with like one of your parents, computers, assuming they have a computer?"
276.6,277.6," Oh, God."
277.6,278.6, I was at all the time.
278.6,281.6, I was just thinking of like the last time I did this.
281.6,283.6, My girlfriend's dad's computer.
283.6,285.6," You know, you go to use it."
285.6,289.6," And in the startup program as bar, there's like 600 programs."
289.6,291.6," And then you go, like, you get through that."
291.6,294.6, And the thing is running like fucking reading.
294.6,295.6, I just did.
295.6,299.6," And then after you get it working, you turn off like internet explorer."
299.6,302.6, There's like 60 different search windows.
302.6,303.6, Yeah.
303.6,306.6, Is like an individual search engine for like Viagra.
306.6,308.6, There's an individual one for home loans.
309.6,311.6, There's like one for everything for you.
311.6,313.6," But then, so I offered."
313.6,314.6," I was like, you got going."
314.6,316.6," Hey man, this is pretty bad."
316.6,322.6," You know, you want me to do a little work so that when you turn your computer on, you're not like basically trying to run a simulation of,"
322.6,325.6," I don't know, whatever world worth read or something."
325.6,326.6, It's not a lot more.
326.6,328.6," So he's like, okay, sure."
328.6,330.6, So I did it and I just stripped it down.
330.6,334.6," You know, the basic, you know, the MS can fake to the basic things."
334.6,336.6," And then as soon as I turned it on, he was so horrified."
336.6,338.6, He started screaming and freaking out.
338.6,341.6," Like, oh my god, what did you do?"
341.6,347.6," I'm gonna figure out that there are like one of the billion colorful, like icons all over the desktop."
347.6,350.6, As you had another way to get those programs running.
350.6,351.6, That are trying to start.
351.6,352.6, I started a computer.
352.6,354.6, So he made me turn it back.
354.6,355.6, I thought of that.
355.6,357.6, I was wondering if you guys had some cause.
357.6,361.6," On some other, just in general too, like parents, you know, when you're that age,"
361.6,363.6, your dad doesn't want you to play a video game.
363.6,364.6, It's on the TV.
364.6,365.6, You're gonna break my TV.
365.6,366.6, Yeah.
366.6,368.6," You know, I remember when I was like 20 something."
368.6,370.6," My dad, they had this piece of shit computer."
370.6,371.6, And I went to print something out on it.
371.6,373.6, And he was a stressant and sweating.
373.6,377.6, Like I was gonna break it by putting a document on the computer.
377.6,381.6," Yeah, I get that shit every time I go home to either of my mom or my dad."
381.6,384.6," It's like me being there is like, like, they've saved up stuff."
384.6,385.6," Could you like it, my computer?"
385.6,387.6, Because there's a few things wrong on it.
387.6,389.6, I don't know what's going on at all.
389.6,392.6," And it's always just like the most normal, like, you know,"
392.6,395.6, it's usually like windows update.
395.6,397.6, It wants to put these things on my computer.
397.6,398.6, I don't know what it is.
398.6,402.6, And I heard on the radio that I shouldn't put anything on there.
402.6,405.6, They said I'm on a talk show that there's viruses.
405.6,408.6," Like yeah, these are like updates at windows as put out."
408.6,409.6, So you won't get any.
409.6,410.6, This is okay.
410.6,415.6, Makes it like 10 times worse because it now asks you for permission to do anything.
415.6,416.6, So they get all super paranoid.
416.6,417.6, I better.
417.6,418.6," Well, like I don't, but I'm sure."
418.6,419.6, But then it's just that.
419.6,420.6," Yeah, right."
420.6,425.6, But when those update doing it to him on a on a buy and your basis now every time they try to like do anything.
425.6,428.6, If are you sure you want to open this program?
428.6,430.6," No, I'm scared."
430.6,433.6, And it asked for this requires administrators privilege.
433.6,434.6, Ministers.
434.6,435.6, We'll see administrators.
435.6,436.6, That's you.
436.6,437.6, Is that who bought the computer?
437.6,441.6," The best the best call I got from my dad was he left a message on my,"
441.6,443.6, on my voice mail.
443.6,446.6," It was like, Jeffrey, I needed to call me back right away."
446.6,447.6, It's really urgent.
447.6,450.6, I'm really need your help with my computer.
450.6,454.6," So I call him up and he tells me that he had,"
454.6,461.6, I guess one afternoon he had gone to an adult website.
461.6,462.6," Oh, shit."
462.6,463.6, We're talking about.
463.6,464.6, It made me proud of my 70 for.
464.6,465.6, You might have trained my day.
465.6,466.6, I still interested.
466.6,468.6, Did I tell the story?
468.6,471.6," No, I was just about to sit something similar."
471.6,472.6, Okay.
472.6,476.6," But he, but the problem was he went to the site and it was one of those sites where like,"
476.6,480.6," you, you go there and if you click whatever it resets your home,"
480.6,481.6," yeah, so that's not."
481.6,482.6," Yeah, so that's not."
482.6,483.6, I don't know.
483.6,484.6, That's.
484.6,485.6, But.
485.6,487.6," So, and then when when you load internet explorer,"
487.6,490.6," not only does the does that site come up,"
490.6,492.6, but pop ups come off all over the screen.
492.6,494.6," And so my step mom, you know,"
494.6,498.6," he, he needed to get the six before my step mom was going to come home and use the computer"
498.6,499.6, because I shared.
499.6,501.6," He was like, I can't every time I load internet explorer,"
501.6,503.6, there's poor and all over my window.
503.6,504.6, What do I do?
504.6,507.6, Maybe I'll help you dad.
507.6,508.6, I don't know.
508.6,510.6, This is kind of a funny predicament.
510.6,511.6, Maybe I'll help you.
511.6,514.6," You're a little bit, you're a little even twisted in the wind."
514.6,516.6," Yeah, so I told him had to change your home page,"
516.6,517.6, but it was amazing.
517.6,521.6," You know, that to me, that's like everybody knows how to do that."
521.6,523.6, But guess not true.
523.6,525.6," Then I told him all about clear history,"
525.6,527.6, which made him really happy.
527.6,528.6," Oh, this was amazing."
528.6,530.6," So, for no one else could I clear it."
530.6,531.6, That's what is there for today.
531.6,532.6, I want to do the cash.
532.6,535.6," So, your step mom started looking to see if the history had been cleared."
535.6,539.6, You mean to say you looked at target.com all day today?
539.6,541.6, I don't have the day off.
541.6,544.6, I've got a good spirit for just going to tell him embarrassing internet.
544.6,545.6, Okay.
545.6,548.6," When I was home with my mom for Christmas, I think."
548.6,552.6," She wanted to show me my cousins, like literally it was a pony webpage."
552.6,555.6," It's like, oh, your 12-year-old cousin has a really good pony webpage."
555.6,557.6, Let's look at the pony webpage.
557.6,558.6," So, we're going to the computer."
558.6,560.6, She was seriously wanting to show it.
560.6,562.6," You know, is this like a solid or out person?"
562.6,563.6, What's it?
563.6,565.6, How old is the person with the pony webpage?
565.6,566.6, Like 12-year-old.
566.6,567.6, Okay.
567.6,568.6, We're just chatting about things.
568.6,569.6, Okay.
569.6,570.6, Members that I haven't seen in nine years are doing.
570.6,571.6," Okay, sure."
571.6,572.6, I'll look at the pony webpage.
572.6,573.6, We go there.
573.6,574.6," She's like, hmm, my was there yesterday."
574.6,575.6, It opens up the history bar.
575.6,577.6, It's the most my brothers computer.
577.6,580.6, Long list of porn websites come up.
580.6,582.6, And we just kind of evolved to ignore it.
582.6,583.6, And move on to the class.
583.6,585.6," We're just like, all right."
585.6,587.6, Let's just go past that one.
587.6,588.6, That one.
588.6,589.6, Where's the pony?
589.6,590.1, Find the plow.
590.1,592.1, Where they out like kind of nasty names.
592.1,593.1," Like, oh, yeah, they're a total nasty."
593.1,594.1, Yeah.
594.1,595.1, It's funny though.
595.1,597.1," See, it's dangerous stuff."
597.1,599.1," Looking at it, you know what the brother is like,"
599.1,601.1, She'd be experiencing general.
601.1,602.1, It's one I find myself in those.
602.1,604.1," Like, you know, a friend's come over and you're hanging out"
604.1,606.1," and you're like flipping through TV and you're like,"
606.1,608.1," you realize there's nothing on, nothing even make fun of."
608.1,610.1," But you're like, shit, dude, there's probably a billion things"
610.1,612.1, on a line that we could do.
612.1,614.1," And then it's like, we all just kind of huddler around."
614.1,617.1," Like, it's the fucking, uh, what is it?"
617.1,619.1, The monolith in the chest.
619.1,620.1, Yeah.
620.1,621.1, The little bones and shakes them with the other one.
621.1,622.1, It's a phone set.
622.1,626.1," Yeah, a lot of laugh at the quarter inch sized thumbnail YouTube screen."
626.1,629.1," They're really, although it is about your readers that do not,"
629.1,634.1, they do not want to enable even two people sitting by them.
634.1,635.1, I don't know what it is.
635.1,639.1, Somebody was somebody at another gaming publication was hitting me up
639.1,644.1," because they were working on a story on multi upcoming multiplayer games,"
644.1,648.1, upcoming PC multi-player games that you would play with somebody.
648.1,651.1," But like at the computer, like hot seated or not."
651.1,652.1, Yeah.
652.1,653.1, And I couldn't think of one.
653.1,654.1," Paggle, I played that way."
654.1,656.1, That's like a casual game.
656.1,659.1," But it's like, yeah, like, look at you sharing the keyboard."
659.1,660.1, It's really my girlfriend.
660.1,662.1," So you just throw our legs over each other, you know."
662.1,664.1," But it's like you're sharing the keyboard and it's, you're still kind of like,"
664.1,666.1, the monitors turn more to you.
666.1,667.1," No, it's turn more to you."
667.1,668.1, Yeah.
668.1,669.1, I can't line up my shot.
669.1,670.1, Turn the fucking monitor.
670.1,671.1, Right.
671.1,673.1, PC is a personal experience.
673.1,674.1," It's really, yeah."
674.1,675.1, So it's always tried to.
675.1,677.1," So it's not going to work for a fun, let's you get a lot of music"
677.1,679.1, to play with the size like 30 inch monitors or something.
679.1,680.1, Yeah.
680.1,682.1," It's weird too because you know, when it's like when I have friends come from"
682.1,686.1," out of town, it's not so much more, but like, you know, just like sleepovers,"
686.1,689.1," you know, come over have some beers and play some games at night."
689.1,692.1," But then like if friends come from out of town now,"
692.1,695.1," it's like, it's like, all the good games we'd be playing multiplayer"
695.1,696.1, are online.
696.1,699.1, It'd be more fun if we had our own screen in our own thing anyway.
699.1,703.1, So the exception of a place sold caliber and bomber man and stuff like that.
703.1,705.1," All the people out there, they're like, that's why"
705.1,707.1, splits Korean can never die.
707.1,709.1, You need to have a camera just what the weed for others.
709.1,710.1, They're not doing splits.
710.1,711.1, That's what the weed for.
711.1,712.1, Yeah.
712.1,713.1, Yeah.
713.1,714.1, We did that.
714.1,715.1, I toy.
715.1,717.1, You show that kind of shit to strangers in the same way.
717.1,719.1, Is the feeling you had when you saw the pony page?
719.1,723.1, I was at a wedding yesterday with a bunch of non gaming people.
723.1,728.1, And some woman came up and asked me about what I thought about the why.
728.1,730.1, And it took me like three times.
730.1,732.1," It was like, you mean the weed?"
732.1,734.1," And that's what she, the thing way you wait."
734.1,736.1, You just think you were in realising you were correcting one of the
736.1,738.1, differentiation of the weed.
738.1,739.1," Like, why?"
739.1,743.1," Like, how do you even know what it is if you don't know it's even called the weed?"
743.1,744.1, This has been speaking.
744.1,745.1, I guess.
745.1,746.1, You've been seeing it in text.
746.1,747.1, Why?
747.1,748.1, Right about in the tech pages.
748.1,751.1," Like, if you're calling it the why, this is not something you need."
751.1,753.1," She reads the paper, but doesn't watch the news."
753.1,754.1, Yeah.
754.1,756.1," Well, Jeff, that's shameful, man."
756.1,757.1, What?
757.1,758.1, Did I make it fun or hurt for it?
758.1,761.1," Well, you're mad at someone because they mispronounced the fucking weed."
761.1,764.1, I'm just saying it for that far away from the weed.
764.1,766.1, That you don't even know how to pronounce it.
766.1,767.1, Three letter word.
767.1,770.1," It's a digitizing, not digitating."
770.1,771.1, It's a digitizing.
771.1,775.1," Is it a job or no, it's a digitizing."
775.1,776.1, Not a rooto.
776.1,779.1, She was trying to make a leave it.
779.1,780.1, Good.
780.1,781.1, She was trying to make conversation.
781.1,785.1," And I was just being a pissy little, you lead us bitch."
785.1,786.1, Yeah.
786.1,787.1, Excuse me.
787.1,788.1, It's weed.
788.1,791.1," It's stretching back from beyond this morning, then."
791.1,794.1," It goes, it has far region."
794.1,798.1," I just, you know, I don't like it when, I mean, I know people are like trying to make up."
798.1,804.1," But when you don't, don't you get annoyed when people hear you're, you know, related to the gaming industry."
804.1,808.1, And then they ask you whatever random question that has nothing to do with that just because it was in the news.
808.1,810.1, I know they're trying to make conversation wherever you know.
810.1,811.1," Oh, I played mess."
811.1,812.1, But you've done that's great.
812.1,813.1, Okay.
813.1,814.1," Well, that was 13 years ago."
814.1,815.1, I don't give a fuck.
815.1,816.1, Yeah.
816.1,817.1," No, when you could tell the game."
817.1,819.1," Well, now that we're, I'm playing on sweet for kids."
819.1,820.1, I don't want to beat this love.
820.1,822.1, Random random random random random.
822.1,825.1, We might not even get to PC gaming stuff where at least talking to
825.1,827.1, potentially about computers and games.
827.1,830.1, So put them together and we're having a few more gaming.
830.1,831.1, But this is more than just all the world.
831.1,833.1, The whole casual thing is going nowhere.
833.1,836.1," And today someone posted, you know, reviews for the PS3 game,"
836.1,843.1, Lair started going up and I don't eat GM's were less favorable than any developer would like it.
843.1,846.1, We used and one of the studio heads posted it.
846.1,848.1, Or a sponsor for him.
848.1,852.1, And it was really interesting because it was basically the weed defense.
852.1,854.1, It was like the wee alibi.
854.1,856.1," It was like, well, you just don't get it."
856.1,859.1, This is a game for for everyone.
859.1,861.1," You know, it's supposed to be accessible to everyone."
861.1,863.1," And he goes, let me tell you a story."
863.1,864.1, Oh.
864.1,865.1, And then maybe he was being nice.
865.1,867.1, So let me not throw an asshole.
867.1,868.1, It's super defensive.
868.1,869.1," Hi, but defensive tone on it."
869.1,871.1," But he told the story is, hey, my great."
871.1,873.1, My grandfather or step grandfather.
873.1,875.1, He's a pretty real grandfather.
875.1,876.1, That was really good.
876.1,877.1," Yeah, played this game."
877.1,880.1, I was watching him play the first level and he was loving it.
880.1,882.1, Grandpa was loving this shit.
882.1,885.1, And what do you got to say about that?
885.1,887.1, Make a game for everyone.
887.1,890.1," So that was a slap in because for one,"
890.1,898.1, when you make a game designed from the get go for and it really is for everyone like we sports.
898.1,900.1, That's a whole other story then.
900.1,904.1," Well, you've got a game where Grandpa can, you know, wave his arm,"
904.1,910.1, flail his arms around and he sees or some loose correlation with what's happening on screen and kind of laugh for the first level of things.
910.1,913.1," I mean, did you got to dig grandpa beat the fucking game?"
913.1,915.1, I'm sure his love that shit.
915.1,917.1, He might have died from way to the armor and about the.
917.1,918.1, Beat that game.
918.1,919.1, Everybody has to grab a beat.
919.1,920.1, I'm like cracking.
920.1,922.1, I'm not a fucking game.
922.1,924.1," And also it's like the difference between I said this in a post,"
924.1,926.1, between Toy Story and like rain a fire or something.
926.1,928.1, There are some things that are clearly from the beginning.
928.1,933.1," You're like, okay, this is going to be something that people of all ages will be seeing."
933.1,936.1," Whereas when you make rain a fire and you start from the very, you know,"
936.1,939.1," concept drafting phase, you say, you need to immediately like."
939.1,943.1," You know, many people off of our, you know, to check this out list."
943.1,947.1," I can't believe it was trying to say that layer is supposed to be this, you know,"
947.1,948.1, grandpa.
948.1,953.1," And the funniest thing was book, the stupidest thing is that if you're going to argue that the."
953.1,956.1, This whole game is about accessibility to everyone.
956.1,964.1," Well, then why not put access for the people who want to play with an analog stick in buttons in it when you've got a system that's got a controller that's got analog stick in buttons."
964.1,965.1, Give us the choice.
965.1,968.1," I mean, that alone just kills the whole thing."
968.1,972.1," Maybe you would have a case if someone was bitching about and they had the option and they didn't like the one,"
972.1,976.1, the sick because this is all coming from problems with the success of control for it.
976.1,980.1," It's like, well, what are you going to say?"
980.1,985.1," I mean, you took away a choice from us and you're trying to use like."
985.1,987.1, Accessibility is an alibi just doesn't work.
987.1,995.1," Anyway, I thought that was funny and I'm curious to see if we see more and more of this in the future where, oh, you just don't get it because it's for everyone."
995.1,996.1, It's not for you.
996.1,998.1, Like like like hell.
998.1,999.1, They're just for me.
999.1,1000.1, And everyone.
1000.1,1002.1," Actually, it was made for me from the minute, fuck it."
1002.1,1003.1, Let's decide.
1003.1,1006.1," You know, like, it's not for my great grandpa."
1006.1,1007.1, He wouldn't even touch that shit.
1007.1,1008.1, For your dog.
1010.1,1011.1, Yeah.
1011.1,1013.1, So as anyone been playing any PC games.
1014.1,1015.1, Yeah.
1015.1,1016.1, Yeah.
1016.1,1017.1, Technically.
1017.1,1022.1," I don't know what we can talk about, but we'll, well, they actually, before we leave the console thing, one quick thing went through out there that,"
1022.1,1028.1," if you check out this last weekend's weekly free play, it's, it's something pretty cool, which actually I tried this weekend."
1028.1,1034.1," If you have a way and you do the we browser, there's a bunch of flash games you can play that if you, you know, flash games it just require a mouse control."
1034.1,1036.1, So you could use the we remote to play them.
1036.1,1039.1, So there's just one actually I forward you the link earlier.
1039.1,1040.1, Check it out.
1040.1,1041.1, The Rose versus Camilla.
1041.1,1043.1," It's actually basically, it's, it's the weirdest thing."
1043.1,1045.1, It's like an anime slap fight anime slap.
1045.1,1050.1," It's a, it sounds stupid and it's kind of, it's a little, it's a little, it's a little time wasted."
1050.1,1052.1, But if you check out last week's weekly free play.
1052.1,1054.1," Jeff, Jeff, here's anime and slapping."
1054.1,1055.1," He's like, yeah."
1055.1,1057.1, That's the rib Jeff had fun.
1057.1,1058.1, It's awesome.
1058.1,1061.1," The dust clock, except if you're racing back to his desk."
1061.1,1062.1, You're dead.
1062.1,1066.1," He's a whole, he's a whole, he's a whole favorite Japan animation."
1067.1,1070.1, But that was just one of the games I was checking out.
1070.1,1072.1," But seriously, check out last week's free play."
1072.1,1074.1," My, my work and they get that."
1074.1,1076.1, I love the game.
1076.1,1077.1," Yeah, thank you."
1077.1,1078.1, Very nice.
1078.1,1079.1," Wow, well trained here."
1079.1,1080.1," Oh, yeah."
1080.1,1081.1, Here's a fish.
1081.1,1082.1, What a cool.
1082.1,1084.1," She has to be a, yeah."
1084.1,1093.1, So what you play it is anyone playing a PC games.
1093.1,1095.1," Yeah, I'm not, you fellows playing a popular rock."
1095.1,1096.1, He maybe liar of a big term.
1096.1,1097.1," Oh, man."
1097.1,1098.1, That was cool.
1098.1,1099.1, We can talk about it now.
1099.1,1101.1," That was from Saoam NDA, LITHING email Lo."
1101.1,1103.1, But one on the word before you showed up here?
1103.1,1104.1, Oh.
1104.1,1105.1, You want to kick a talk?
1105.1,1107.08, Get you play more on the I did this weekend?
1107.08,1111.8799999999999," Yeah, I've been, well, I've been played for, like, a week now, and I got to level"
1111.8799999999999,1119.12, 10 and decided that I didn't want to play anymore because I like it enough to to be
1119.12,1121.08, convinced I'm going to buy it and play the retail game.
1121.08,1122.3799999999999, But it comes out.
1122.3799999999999,1124.1999999999998," So then, just this is interesting, John Ellyett, because you're a"
1124.2,1128.24," because you are a MMO, a noted MMO, cynic."
1128.24,1131.16," Yeah, and it's, I mean, part of the whole thing is,"
1131.16,1133.6000000000001," as promised, there's an action element to it."
1133.6000000000001,1137.32, So that the combat and the way that the flow of the game
1137.32,1140.32," works, it's more engaging to me than standing next to someone."
1140.32,1142.2," I mean, and I'm describing a tank character."
1142.2,1143.72, I know you don't stand next to someone
1143.72,1147.32, in press 1 through 10 on your number key and win.
1147.32,1151.44," But for me, to be really reductive, that's how I feel."
1151.44,1152.28," I mean, that's what I feel."
1152.28,1153.28, I'm doing.
1153.28,1156.92," Or than that, and then even if you don't support classes"
1156.92,1159.08," and stuff, and I played Guild Wars and liked it a lot,"
1159.08,1160.72, and mainly because of the group dynamic.
1160.72,1164.2, But I was also an element to list in there.
1164.2,1167.56," But just because when you get in this game,"
1167.56,1171.56," you have access to guns and skill sets, and all these things"
1171.56,1171.92, like that.
1171.92,1174.28, But you have a crosshair.
1174.28,1175.68," So that's immediately appealing to me,"
1175.68,1177.76, because I'm used to playing games with the crosshairs
1177.76,1178.56, and whatnot.
1178.56,1182.28," And it's an interesting combination between,"
1182.28,1183.96," if you want everything to lock on,"
1183.96,1186.24, if you want to just immediately auto lock
1186.24,1188.48," to target cycle through lockable targets, you can."
1188.48,1191.56, So if you're completely averse to playing
1191.56,1193.76," in the way you would a shooter or an action game,"
1193.76,1196.08," let's like a shooter, like a half life,"
1196.08,1199.08," than a strangleholder, something a max pain."
1200.2,1201.24," But if you want, you can."
1201.24,1203.6399999999999," Your crosshair is still bigger, depending on the weapon."
1203.6399999999999,1206.0," If you've got a shotgun, it's basically"
1206.0,1210.44," the size of a deluxe piece, a paste it over your monitor."
1210.44,1214.8," And so just, I find that that alone is fun."
1214.8,1216.3600000000001," The fact that you can crouch, like,"
1216.3600000000001,1218.64," so let me give you, I think the best way to do this"
1218.64,1221.8400000000001, is to give you an example of some of the combat in the game.
1221.8400000000001,1224.24," It compats usually with Boris, me and MMOs."
1224.24,1227.3200000000002, And basically that's 90% of any of them.
1227.3200000000002,1228.64, Because cover actually matters.
1228.64,1231.72," Kill, kill, kill, into you can get enough,"
1231.72,1235.64, whatever object it is that you need to satisfy your mission.
1235.64,1239.3200000000002," So here, you can see enemies from a great distance away."
1239.32,1241.72," And if you have a sniper rifle, you crouch down"
1241.72,1245.28," and you'll improve your accuracy, you get the first shot off that way."
1245.28,1247.1599999999999," Then they might see it, you can continue to shoot them."
1247.1599999999999,1249.8799999999999," And if they're, whatever, a berserk or type creature,"
1249.8799999999999,1251.84, they're going to try to rush and close the gap.
1251.84,1254.12," And then as soon as they do, you might want to switch over"
1254.12,1255.08, to a shotgun.
1255.08,1260.36," But then, in the RPG manner, they might be a group of mixed units."
1260.36,1262.08, So some of them might be mechanical.
1262.08,1263.8, You might want to have to hit them with electro-magnetic
1263.8,1266.3999999999999, pulse weapons so that you strip their shields.
1266.3999999999999,1268.72, And then you can do damage to them with ballistics.
1268.72,1271.16, It could be another creature that's entirely immune to the MP
1271.16,1273.0," and for those, you're going to want to have someone"
1273.0,1276.08, hitting it with a chain gun with some other type of ammo
1276.08,1278.1200000000001, using a certain skill set on it.
1278.1200000000001,1281.96," Electricity, if usual RPG stuff,"
1281.96,1284.8," run creatures, we just added to this element"
1284.8,1286.64, instead it will just be this kind of power.
1286.64,1288.88," But anyway, it's just fun."
1288.88,1291.44," Like the combination of that part of RPGs, which I always"
1291.44,1294.28," like, you know, even a final fantasy, the tricks of hitting"
1294.28,1296.72, undead with healing items and stuff like that.
1296.72,1300.52," But in a real time and fast action game, where..."
1300.52,1302.68, It definitely feels more like an action game for sure.
1302.68,1304.76, But how about like the questing stuff?
1304.76,1306.92, And is that in the beta yet?
1306.92,1310.08," That simple quest, I mean, there are all the"
1310.08,1311.64, quest and instances are in the beta yet.
1311.64,1315.48," But I mean, a lot of things that Richard Garry or General"
1315.48,1322.68, British has been saying is in previous demos and stuff.
1322.68,1326.28, He talked a lot about how the questing in Tableau Riser
1326.28,1330.56, was going to have some moral choices and emotional
1330.56,1331.36, resonance to it.
1331.36,1333.32, Have you experienced any of that kind of stuff yet?
1333.32,1335.6," Or I haven't got a link of that yet, but again,"
1335.6,1337.92, I'm just saying when I got to level 10.
1337.92,1338.2, OK.
1338.2,1343.92, What it does have that that's cool is the instant sections.
1343.92,1346.44, Our much will compare to the stuff we
1346.44,1349.6399999999999, are running around doing missions in the MMO that everyone
1349.6399999999999,1352.2, is thrown into on your server on your planet at the same
1352.2,1355.04, time where missions are almost always
1355.04,1357.12, like 10 of these or 5 of these in stuff.
1357.12,1359.36," As soon as you get into an instance, it's cool to graphics"
1359.36,1363.92," become massively, massively sharper and better."
1363.92,1365.76, And assets look a lot better.
1365.76,1367.32," And it looks like if someone was just walking by,"
1367.32,1369.24," they would think, oh, this is just a dedicated action"
1369.24,1372.2, game where they were able to invest all this work into the
1372.2,1374.36, appearance of things and stuff.
1374.36,1377.68," The missions are more inspired, they're cleverly"
1377.68,1379.8," designed, they're more fun to do."
1379.8,1381.96, And that was where I really started liking it.
1381.96,1383.36," And first, that was super skeptical."
1383.36,1387.08," When I turned it on because the introduction is just,"
1387.08,1389.24, it's like I had a friend that was playing.
1389.24,1391.04, And I wanted to jump into the world and just
1391.04,1393.24," get messing around, but you had to do the solo stuff"
1393.24,1394.3999999999999, to get used to it.
1394.3999999999999,1394.76, Right.
1394.76,1396.08," And it was like, yeah."
1396.08,1399.6799999999998," And it totally reminded, it does remind me of auto assault"
1399.6799999999998,1401.24, in a lot of ways.
1401.24,1402.6799999999998," I mean, even to the point where it's just"
1402.6799999999998,1404.24, that it does design things.
1404.24,1407.8," And in the cities, the town, the buildings for the armories"
1407.8,1411.12, and the medic shops and stuff like that.
1411.12,1413.52," It's just very eagles of any like, our P-D-D-A-M-M-O,"
1413.52,1415.28, this is basically.
1415.28,1419.52," But just all in all, that's, I mean, just,"
1419.52,1422.7199999999998, I think it's exciting because I know that all I get a group
1422.7199999999998,1424.6799999999998, of people together and all actually want to play it.
1424.6799999999998,1428.3999999999999," And but it's a shooter fan, why would this"
1428.3999999999999,1433.1599999999999," interesting more than say a battlefield, too, or a quick"
1433.1599999999999,1433.6799999999998, person?
1433.6799999999998,1435.4399999999998," Because it's different, because like say, for example,"
1435.4399999999998,1437.84," if I don't want to get into Quake Wars, and if,"
1437.84,1439.9199999999998," it may be, I hope we have a few friends online"
1439.92,1441.96, and then we're put on the team that sucks ass.
1441.96,1444.8000000000002," And they just, the other team is wiping us out over and over again."
1444.8000000000002,1446.8000000000002, Or I just keep getting frustrated because things
1446.8000000000002,1447.8400000000001, aren't going my way.
1447.8400000000001,1450.68," And then just the high stakes of, you know, people come in"
1450.68,1452.0800000000002, and they know I am.
1452.0800000000002,1454.24, And I want to be playing my best because I got a reputation
1454.24,1455.8400000000001, uphold and all this stress of that.
1455.8400000000001,1457.52, When I just want to get into it like a server
1457.52,1460.04," and just talk shit with friends and still play,"
1460.04,1461.04, find some cool stuff.
1461.04,1463.48," For all the reasons that people do play on the most, you know?"
1463.48,1465.48," But for me, for whatever reason,"
1465.48,1467.88, either the MMO that's been able to do that
1467.88,1470.8000000000002, and keep me playing has been fun for a long time.
1470.8000000000002,1472.96," And I think this has the potential,"
1472.96,1475.2800000000002, at least to keep me around for a longer than a month.
1475.2800000000002,1476.96, How many people can go into an instance?
1476.96,1477.8000000000002, For like theÁ≠â.
1477.8000000000002,1478.5600000000002," I think that's the count on that,"
1478.5600000000002,1481.2800000000002, because I was basically doing with a few people.
1481.2800000000002,1482.3200000000002," Yeah, actually I haven't emailed into them"
1482.3200000000002,1483.6000000000001, and I haven't heard back on that yet.
1483.6000000000001,1484.44, About him.
1484.44,1485.44, So it's variable?
1485.44,1485.92, Yeah.
1485.92,1488.44, How much have it is instanceed?
1488.44,1490.8400000000001, I don't know because I've only played the level 10.
1490.8400000000001,1491.68, Right.
1491.68,1494.0400000000002, So I get any statement I make is from experience
1494.0400000000002,1496.16, and knowledge within that set bit of gameplay.
1496.16,1497.48, So it's like I really have no idea.
1497.48,1499.16, I know there are other planets that you go to.
1499.16,1501.16," Well, I mean, a lot of the questions that you've done"
1501.16,1502.88, have eaten a lot of the instant stuff.
1502.88,1504.44," Even on the place where I'm at,"
1504.44,1505.28, I can see a lot of the...
1505.28,1508.0, Is it quite a few instances?
1508.0,1510.4, I still had first wilderness area or...
1510.4,1513.64," Well, I've covered the entire map on that planet."
1513.64,1514.24," Oh, okay."
1514.24,1515.68, Yeah.
1515.68,1517.92," So, but there are a lot of instances all over it."
1517.92,1519.52," I mean, it's pretty cool."
1519.52,1521.68," I mean, the buzz seems pretty cool on the so far."
1521.68,1524.24," That's a good thing, because it seems for a while."
1524.24,1525.16, I could go either way.
1525.16,1526.6, And I guess it still can't go either way.
1526.6799999999998,1527.4399999999998, Right.
1527.4399999999998,1528.28," Really, no."
1528.28,1530.3999999999999," But, well, I have kind of pegged this in my head"
1530.3999999999999,1533.48," is like the thing that might distract me from, wow."
1533.48,1535.1999999999998," Like, of all the games I've really seen."
1535.1999999999998,1536.1999999999998, Yeah.
1536.1999999999998,1537.1999999999998, You thought this before.
1537.1999999999998,1538.1999999999998, I think it's good to me.
1538.1999999999998,1539.1999999999998, Yeah.
1539.1999999999998,1540.1999999999998," It might not be your favorite one ever, but..."
1540.1999999999998,1541.1999999999998, Right.
1541.1999999999998,1542.1999999999998," Yeah, yeah."
1542.1999999999998,1543.1999999999998, This is a bit of a...
1543.1999999999998,1545.0," It's not just a different version of, wow."
1545.0,1546.3999999999999, Which is like what a lot of people complain
1546.3999999999999,1547.6, to learn the rings online is.
1547.6,1548.6, Sure.
1548.6,1549.6, And it is.
1549.6,1550.6, That is what learn the things.
1550.6,1551.6, This is totally different.
1551.6,1555.04," Well, there it has made a lot of noise about this being like..."
1555.04,1557.04, I don't think he's actually come out and said this is
1557.04,1560.8," the next generation of MMOs, but he's all but implied it"
1560.8,1562.36, if he hasn't said it.
1562.36,1564.52," And so, you know, I guess we'll just have to see"
1564.52,1566.2, how much of a game changer this is.
1566.2,1568.32, There's a few other things to know.
1568.32,1569.1599999999999, Okay.
1569.1599999999999,1570.0, Go ahead.
1570.0,1570.84, Go ahead.
1570.84,1571.68, I was kind of winning this.
1571.68,1572.8799999999999," There's one point that I, it may be kind of minor,"
1572.8799999999999,1574.28," but to me it actually, there's actually"
1574.28,1575.52, stopping from playing some of MMOs.
1575.52,1577.6," It's like, does that moment in any MMO,"
1577.6,1579.84," where some kind of, some guys shooting an arrow"
1579.84,1581.6399999999999, or some kind of melee missile or whatever.
1581.6399999999999,1583.28," Like, it has his heat-sick ability."
1583.28,1584.8, It just can follow me around buildings
1584.8,1585.6399999999999, or whatever.
1585.6399999999999,1587.48, Even though I'm well out of shot range
1587.48,1589.8799999999999, because he got it off the wall the timer changed.
1589.8799999999999,1591.24, I can still get hit by him.
1591.24,1594.32," In this game, it actually pays"
1594.32,1596.96, more attention to that action aspect.
1596.96,1598.9199999999998," So, you mean like to environment?"
1598.9199999999998,1601.36, To a more environmental acknowledgement of what's going on.
1601.36,1602.3999999999999," Well, if you're getting behind the pillar"
1602.3999999999999,1604.08," or crouching or something, aren't you like,"
1604.08,1605.08, less of a roller-wielding?
1605.08,1606.8799999999999," Well, we played in the same game."
1606.8799999999999,1607.9199999999998," Well, the times I've been playing it,"
1607.9199999999998,1609.8," like if I try to attack if somebody,"
1609.8,1613.56," and I'm dodging a shot, the shot doesn't warp around"
1613.56,1615.8, and it'll just go right through the object.
1615.8,1616.6399999999999, It is.
1616.6399999999999,1619.6799999999998, It's not a big claim that it would do a dare in a second.
1619.6799999999998,1621.8," Because, well, when they definitely"
1621.8,1623.52," are a baited thing, but 100% of the time"
1623.52,1625.6799999999998, because we spent a good deal of the time laughing at this
1625.6799999999998,1629.1599999999999, is that if an enemy fires the shot and they had you
1629.1599999999999,1632.04," in their line of sight, even if you move beyond their line"
1632.04,1635.84," of sight or have cover in between you and the shot,"
1635.84,1637.48, it will go right through your mind.
1637.48,1638.48," Yeah, that's not right."
1638.48,1641.04," Yeah, that's not what's supposed to happen here."
1641.04,1641.8799999999999," Oh, yeah."
1641.88,1644.24, I thought he was like banana curbs.
1644.24,1645.7600000000002, I think the colors are nothing actually.
1645.7600000000002,1648.24, Was the cover what essentially altered the di roll involved?
1648.24,1649.2," Yeah, that's right."
1649.2,1651.64, That's what looked to me when they were demoing it.
1651.64,1653.3600000000001," Yeah, it's supposed to be behind cover."
1653.3600000000001,1655.5200000000002," You'll still be hit, but your chance of being hit"
1655.5200000000002,1657.3600000000001, is low and the bullet is still fly to you.
1657.3600000000001,1658.2, Yeah.
1658.2,1660.0800000000002, So I don't think I saw the right environment.
1660.0800000000002,1661.72," You're right, that he had said that the..."
1661.72,1663.1200000000001," Yeah, right, it's a more time there."
1663.1200000000001,1664.1200000000001," Yeah, you're right."
1664.1200000000001,1665.1200000000001," You'll see it a lot, dude."
1665.1200000000001,1667.24," It's more of a cover modifier, like,"
1667.24,1668.5200000000002," I mean, you said that he was like,"
1668.5200000000002,1669.8400000000001," I mean, the odds must have been with me,"
1669.84,1671.52, because I think he just started there.
1671.52,1672.52," Like, how far did you get?"
1672.52,1674.8," I only level five, so I'm not that far."
1674.8,1676.0, Isn't it the beginning of the game
1676.0,1678.48, almost all enemies are using melee?
1678.48,1679.08," Oh, no, actually."
1679.08,1681.36," I was doing with, like, shots coming out and man stuff."
1681.36,1683.6," So when you get the droids out,"
1683.6,1685.36, they like to shoot you with electric bolts
1685.36,1687.8, and they go through and missiles and they go straight through.
1687.8,1689.76," So tell me more about instances here,"
1689.76,1692.3999999999999," because I want to know, because, like, in, wow,"
1692.3999999999999,1694.04, your five guys going in the way
1694.04,1695.1999999999998, instances are set up in that game
1695.1999999999998,1698.3999999999999," as you have, like, very specific groups of enemies"
1698.3999999999999,1699.04, milling about.
1699.04,1702.32," And you go kind of sit there with your friends and you go, okay."
1702.32,1704.3999999999999," There's two kinds of this guy, three kinds of this guy"
1704.3999999999999,1705.24, that's one over here.
1705.24,1706.08, That's how it is.
1706.08,1707.2," Okay, so there's these poles that you have."
1707.2,1708.6399999999999," And they're like, they're just a clip on the boss,"
1708.6399999999999,1709.84," like, characters, you know, where, like,"
1709.84,1712.92, maybe a big giant walker will come up out of the ground.
1712.92,1713.76, Yep.
1713.76,1715.84," And he's not the last boss, but on the way,"
1715.84,1716.96," and you'll know that that's coming,"
1716.96,1717.84," and you're going to want to take,"
1717.84,1720.1599999999999," how one guy take his shields down as fast as we can,"
1720.1599999999999,1723.28," maybe with, like, maybe he's got an EMP chain gun,"
1724.3999999999999,1727.36," which is pretty cool for a game like that, just blast."
1727.36,1728.12," And, you know,"
1728.1999999999998,1729.8799999999999, but they're not like just constantly dynamically
1729.8799999999999,1730.7199999999998, spawning around you.
1730.7199999999998,1731.56," No, it's not."
1731.56,1733.8," And there are certain types, you know, then you get inside."
1733.8,1736.04," So, for example, one of the instances,"
1736.04,1738.9199999999998," you know, you go into this underground facility"
1738.9199999999998,1740.76, and basically a robot factory.
1740.76,1742.6799999999998," And inside there, there's also all these places,"
1742.6799999999998,1744.04," very doom like, you know, where they're doing"
1744.04,1747.36, by organic experiments on human hosts and things.
1747.36,1748.56, And that's what all I'm going to do.
1748.56,1751.04, Just monstrous things come out.
1751.04,1752.52," And the first time you see him, it's kind of like,"
1752.52,1754.04," oh, crap, I don't know what to deal with that."
1754.04,1756.1999999999998, You can see that he's got a really high level on him.
1756.1999999999998,1757.9199999999998," And then he starts, you know, throwing up things,"
1757.92,1759.96, like reflect on various weapons you're using.
1759.96,1761.3200000000002," And you're going to like back off and say,"
1761.3200000000002,1762.96," all right, just everyone stops shooting at him"
1762.96,1764.0, because we're killing ourselves.
1764.0,1764.8400000000001," Yeah, man."
1764.8400000000001,1765.68, Yeah.
1765.68,1767.28," So that's very, that's very well-"
1767.28,1768.1200000000001, Instance.
1768.1200000000001,1770.1200000000001, Another criminal thing about this game that's going to make
1770.1200000000001,1772.48, it stand out as the cloning system.
1772.48,1773.3200000000002, And right.
1773.3200000000002,1774.16, Because that sounds good.
1774.16,1775.68," There are equivalents to this and other,"
1775.68,1776.8400000000001, I don't think that's in a rock.
1776.8400000000001,1778.04," Yeah, this is very cool."
1778.04,1780.52," But at any point in the game after you,"
1780.52,1782.64," you reach a certain, you know, level,"
1782.64,1784.5600000000002, you can say I'm going to create a clone of myself.
1784.5600000000002,1786.76," And then the clone will stay at the same level,"
1786.76,1790.8799999999999, but it won't have the attribute point spent.
1790.8799999999999,1793.44," So you can basically, like, re-roll constantly"
1793.44,1794.12, throughout the game.
1794.12,1796.16, So you can clone like three versions of yourself
1796.16,1798.68," and say, hey, I want one where I take the route"
1798.68,1801.72," where I just completely maximize my melee, which is funny,"
1801.72,1802.84, because then you can go up and rifle
1802.84,1805.28, but someone intends to him flying across the screen.
1805.28,1807.04," And then you can go to, you know, then shoot him"
1807.04,1808.84, with your rifle because he's knocked him in the good range
1808.84,1810.68, for that.
1810.68,1813.12," Your electricity or shielding, you call in air strikes"
1813.12,1814.44, and stuff like that later on.
1814.44,1815.76," I mean, if you want to, you have drones"
1815.76,1817.0, that fight with you.
1817.0,1819.8, So if you want to go and specialize in anyone of those
1819.8,1822.36," more than the other, and the important one always can."
1822.36,1825.32, You don't have to sit and see another guy meet another player
1825.32,1827.0," and say, ah, what's it like playing that?"
1827.0,1828.84," I thought about doing that build, but I never did."
1828.84,1829.84, I kind of regretted.
1829.84,1831.68, I think I'm playing with you when I see yours
1831.68,1833.56, as a little more kick ass in mind.
1833.56,1834.8799999999999, So an important distinction for this game
1834.8799999999999,1836.64, is that you're kind of classless at the beginning
1836.64,1839.32, and you have various points you kind of keep branching
1839.32,1840.24, into different classes.
1840.24,1842.44," Unlike, while or whatever, where you've just picked priest."
1842.44,1843.28, Right.
1843.28,1844.8," Because like, while has the talent structure"
1844.8,1846.0, where you can respawn at any time
1846.0,1847.32, and become a different kind of priest?
1847.32,1847.68, Yeah.
1847.68,1850.12, So that you can't go all the way back and be something else.
1850.12,1850.48, Right.
1850.48,1852.72, Whereas this was a pretty clever.
1852.72,1855.3999999999999, So that's the trick those cloning at those key points
1855.3999999999999,1857.48," at those key, so if you miss it, if you're screwed."
1857.48,1858.32, For sure.
1858.32,1859.1599999999999, Mm-hmm.
1859.1599999999999,1861.12, That was a clever design decision though.
1861.12,1864.8," I mean, that eliminated one of those big hurdles,"
1864.8,1865.9199999999998, which is the regret.
1865.9199999999998,1869.2, Not wanting to start over from the beginning with the same
1869.2,1872.2," content you've done, get the level on content again."
1872.2,1873.08, That was pretty smart.
1873.08,1874.0," Now, I think that's awesome."
1874.0,1875.44, I'm sure there's going to be so-and-out there
1875.44,1877.04, that fun is a reason to bitch about it
1877.04,1879.8, because it's not the way that they've been eaten there.
1879.8,1881.76, They're meal with the peas and the wild-vrient.
1881.76,1882.6, Of course.
1882.6,1883.6," Yeah, they're most good."
1883.6,1884.72, Kill versus them like that.
1884.72,1885.8, There are still people that shouldn't
1885.8,1887.8, that things aren't the way they were in the original
1887.8,1890.8," UO and, you know, yeah."
1890.8,1892.36, No one here though.
1892.36,1893.84, You're Ryan.
1893.84,1894.84, You're Ryan.
1894.84,1896.24," Ryan, are you going to play Tabiola or else?"
1896.24,1897.24, Do you think?
1897.24,1898.24, I am.
1898.24,1899.24, That appeals to you.
1899.24,1900.04," Well, the only thing that matters to Ryan"
1900.04,1901.04, is if there's PvP at it.
1901.04,1901.88, That's a good gill.
1901.88,1903.48," I was going to ask, but you guys got"
1903.48,1904.32, PvP.
1904.32,1906.0," I haven't played it yet, but it's got PvP."
1906.0,1907.16, Did it have Baby PvP?
1907.16,1908.6, It should be fun PvP.
1908.6,1909.8, What's Baby PvP?
1909.8,1912.32, Anything where you can't just walk up to somebody
1912.32,1913.52, and attack them is Baby PvP.
1913.52,1914.32, It's Baby PvP.
1914.32,1915.16," Okay, then."
1915.16,1916.0, Yeah.
1916.0,1917.0, Good.
1917.0,1918.0, Planners.
1918.0,1919.0, I'd like another observation about this.
1919.0,1921.3600000000001, You can make that happen.
1921.3600000000001,1924.24, And that's when you're out with a group of friends
1924.24,1925.44, and you're doing a mission with them.
1925.44,1927.92, And then you realize that you didn't officially
1927.92,1928.92, take that mission.
1928.92,1929.76, Yeah.
1929.76,1931.92, But you've completed all of the requirements.
1931.92,1932.92, Yeah.
1932.92,1934.0800000000002, You fulfilled all the requirements to complete the mission
1934.0800000000002,1935.28," and you go, but you don't get credit."
1935.28,1938.2, It's just like the end of Star Wars when they're giving out
1938.2,1940.88," the medals and the fall of a sudden, if they put the"
1940.88,1942.96, medal around Luke and then Haul and Solo and then they get
1942.96,1944.52," the chewy and they're like, sorry, dude."
1944.52,1946.5600000000002, You didn't talk to the princess.
1946.5600000000002,1947.4, That's the question.
1947.4,1949.52, This probably happened to go back and rescue her again.
1949.52,1950.52, Wow.
1950.52,1952.88, I gone some long thing and then everybody's getting
1952.88,1954.8400000000001," the head off the guy and I'm like, how come I'm like,"
1954.8400000000001,1957.24, I never had the quest.
1957.24,1958.5600000000002, Yeah.
1958.5600000000002,1959.68, So you'll be back.
1959.68,1960.04, Yeah.
1960.04,1960.68, That's got to go.
1960.68,1961.68, MMO.
1961.68,1963.48," That's another thing where you're like, why is it"
1963.48,1968.24, take so long for various changes to occur in MMOs?
1968.24,1969.8," Well, was wild the first one to do."
1969.8,1973.44, Somebody will correct me if not you guys and the listeners.
1973.44,1977.0, The share quest option that wild has.
1977.0,1977.64, I don't know.
1977.64,1978.64, Wow.
1978.64,1980.92," Well, let you share a quest with people in your party who"
1980.92,1981.92, don't have it yet.
1981.92,1984.3200000000002," Oh, there's a city of heroes like you."
1984.3200000000002,1985.3200000000002, There are restrictions.
1985.3200000000002,1986.3200000000002, Right.
1986.3200000000002,1989.0," If you're not on the right part of the chain or something,"
1989.0,1991.56," further is like the quest give her a gave you a basket,"
1991.56,1992.48, put the apples in.
1992.48,1993.64, You're not going to be able to get a kill.
1993.64,1994.48, Yeah.
1994.48,1995.48, That's how the anyway.
1995.48,1996.28, One of you would go talk to the guy.
1996.28,2001.96," Because like, for example, there's one NPC in"
2001.96,2005.64," Tabularasa who wants you to, I'm just trying to figure out a way"
2005.64,2007.96," to talk around it without saying, giving you the specifics"
2007.96,2009.56, of the quest because it could not be there.
2009.56,2010.24, It's a beta.
2010.24,2011.56, They might erase it all together.
2011.56,2012.84, It was actually a cool quest.
2012.84,2015.56, But I'm just using a random example.
2015.56,2018.72, And he's basically running an illicit practice.
2018.72,2021.32, And he wants you to help him continue.
2021.32,2025.68, And you can either choose to go and work against him.
2025.68,2027.84," And ultimately, this boils down to who you talk to."
2027.84,2030.56, It's not like you have some well-developed relationship
2030.56,2031.96, with this guy or anything.
2031.96,2033.6000000000001," But it would be like, it's so funny."
2033.6000000000001,2036.32," Because it's kind of like a behind the circle K meeting,"
2036.32,2037.76," you know, that takes them over here."
2037.76,2039.96, But then everyone in your party's got to go have the same thing.
2039.96,2040.76," Well, right."
2040.76,2042.32, That's just kind of like stretches.
2042.32,2045.56," Well, that's a suspension of disbelief that there always is."
2045.56,2048.7599999999998," I mean, like, you know, it's like the wow quest where you do have to"
2048.7599999999998,2049.96, like get some guys head.
2049.96,2051.12, And there's a party of five.
2051.12,2053.4, And then you each have to go up one by one and get his head.
2053.4,2053.88, Yeah.
2053.88,2055.92," And I remember I was going to be like, he didn't have five heads."
2055.92,2059.7999999999997," It's just, it's just, it's just, you see everyone get his nose."
2059.7999999999997,2060.7999999999997, Right.
2060.7999999999997,2061.7999999999997, You get it.
2061.7999999999997,2062.7999999999997, You get it.
2062.7999999999997,2063.7999999999997, Yeah.
2063.7999999999997,2064.7999999999997, The 19th time you kill him.
2064.7999999999997,2065.7999999999997, Right.
2065.7999999999997,2068.84," That's when I have those moments of like, I feel sorry for these guys"
2068.84,2073.32," because because these guys being the NPCs, because they have a lifespan"
2073.32,2075.56," of about like two minutes, they're born."
2075.56,2076.96, They get ganked.
2076.96,2077.96, They get their heads taken.
2077.96,2079.36, They come back and come back.
2079.36,2080.36, Yeah.
2080.36,2085.96," The sad, the sad, the poor hogger dead over and over and over and over and over"
2085.96,2087.76, for all eternity.
2087.76,2088.76, Is this a facility?
2088.76,2091.76," Do you guys know who, who, who Gammon is?"
2091.76,2092.6000000000004, No.
2092.6000000000004,2093.6000000000004," Am I, am I being saying it was me wrong?"
2093.6000000000004,2094.6000000000004," It's a, oh, that part of my life."
2094.6000000000004,2095.88, You guys don't find more for you.
2095.88,2097.2000000000003," I know he's in the program, right?"
2097.2000000000003,2101.92, He's used this toron in PC that spawns and the program are in.
2101.92,2105.36, And he's like part of some rogue quest where you have to pick pocket him.
2105.36,2106.6800000000003, But he's yellow when he spawns.
2106.6800000000003,2107.96, So anybody can kill him.
2107.96,2110.56, So he'll just spawn in somebody alone immediately.
2110.56,2113.16, He'll just spawn over and over.
2113.16,2115.76, It's a good way to get linen cloth.
2115.76,2120.56," Yeah, that's the other thing about MMOs when the quest might be to get five tusks"
2120.56,2124.64, or whatever and you just find a field and you see a bunch of guys just all standing around
2124.64,2126.92, waiting for this shit to spawn in.
2126.92,2130.2400000000002, That's the kind of thing that's funny because I hear about it and then the guy I'm playing
2130.2400000000002,2131.2400000000002," with Roy is like, oh yeah."
2131.24,2134.68, And he says whatever the name is for that like I heard about this shit.
2134.68,2135.68, Why do I have to be living it?
2135.68,2139.8799999999997," You know, it's like the most ridiculous aspects of MMOs just like that."
2139.8799999999997,2142.68, Everyone standing waiting for some dumb spawn.
2142.68,2143.68, Yeah.
2143.68,2146.24," And he was like, yeah, this was crack me up too."
2146.24,2149.12, I guess there's some game where they determine the spawn ends.
2149.12,2152.52," The loot drops or whatever based on like your name and some kind of like,"
2152.52,2154.9599999999996, alter them they got with like how it's alphabetized.
2154.9599999999996,2158.0," Well, there's people freaking out like, I didn't get my drop."
2158.0,2159.0, I didn't get my drop.
2159.08,2162.44, This has got to be that fucked up system where they're only given it to people that are like
2162.44,2163.96, jeetersy or what?
2163.96,2164.96, That's ridiculous.
2164.96,2165.96, I don't know.
2165.96,2166.96, They're just that.
2166.96,2167.96, Yeah.
2167.96,2168.96, Yeah.
2168.96,2173.52," Drop rates are, you know, all these things you're bringing out these are like constant"
2173.52,2174.52, endless.
2174.52,2175.52, Yeah.
2175.52,2177.32," I mean, instances of resolution to the major problem."
2177.32,2179.16," Yeah, they are instances fixed a lot."
2179.16,2181.04," And while it is a lot of like dynamic,"
2181.04,2183.8," like the more people killing it, the more things will spawn."
2183.8,2187.0," So from most places, it's not too terrible."
2187.0,2188.4, Remember camp checks?
2188.44,2189.44," Yeah, really."
2189.44,2190.76, I don't really do that anymore.
2190.76,2194.12, And everything like camp checks or that might be old EQ.
2194.12,2197.48," So like every other thing, people would just, you know, because there were no"
2197.48,2198.0, instances.
2198.0,2201.96," So all the biggest, the most important things that people needed, they were always like"
2201.96,2203.28, Disneyland lines form.
2203.4,2205.76, And it was a free for all because it wasn't your space.
2205.76,2206.1600000000003, Yeah.
2206.1600000000003,2207.56, So people would just camp.
2207.56,2211.04," You know, they would just sit there and wait and then, you know, there'd be disputes."
2211.04,2212.36," Like, oh, it was your first."
2212.36,2215.1600000000003, If you like people would just come on and go camp check it on.
2215.16,2216.16," Yeah, but I don't know."
2216.16,2218.7999999999997," But I'm pretty much like playing Pinata, you know, that the candy breaks up."
2218.7999999999997,2220.3199999999997, Everybody just runs for it.
2220.3199999999997,2225.16," Yeah, that's when they're back back when they had like big server-wide like"
2225.16,2226.64, message boards for raids.
2226.64,2228.7999999999997," So like, okay, we're going to kill the dragon on Tuesday."
2228.7999999999997,2231.12, That's other guilds going to kill the dragon on Wednesday.
2231.12,2233.96, And then there's other guilds going to get on Thursday unless they don't finish.
2233.96,2235.7599999999998, That's some fucked up repugnant shit.
2235.7599999999998,2236.96, I don't do that anymore.
2236.96,2239.8799999999997," And it's way easy to refal that stuff, too."
2239.8799999999997,2240.8799999999997, That's some good.
2240.8799999999997,2242.24," If you want to be a jerk, yeah."
2242.24,2243.24, It's not too.
2243.3199999999997,2244.72," If you take a break, we'll do there."
2244.72,2245.72," Yeah, okay."
2245.72,2246.72, We'll take a break.
2246.72,2249.16, We'll be back with more hatred.
2249.16,2253.16, This one up podcast is brought to you by Games for Windows.
2253.16,2255.3599999999997, Welcome to Better PC Gaming.

2272.0,2273.0," Well, we're back."
2273.0,2276.7999999999997, And we're going to talk about trailers in a segment we like to call trailer trash.
2276.7999999999997,2277.64," Oh, okay."
2277.64,2278.24, That's it.
2279.0,2280.12, I didn't catch you.
2280.12,2280.68, Is that good?
2284.3599999999997,2285.08, That's great.
2287.08,2290.24," So, what, there were at least a couple trailers that came out last week."
2290.24,2291.72," One of them being, come on."
2291.72,2296.8399999999997," Yeah, the TV game stuff lost in the heroes."
2297.16,2299.3999999999996," What do we, what do we think of lost?"
2299.7200000000003,2302.0, The gloss looks like a bad PS2 game.
2302.0,2302.84, Yeah.
2302.84,2303.36, Yeah.
2303.36,2304.04, I don't know.
2304.04,2305.04, It could have been anything.
2305.04,2306.04, I don't know what it was.
2306.04,2308.2400000000002," It's, there's so, like, nothing coming out of that right now."
2308.2400000000002,2309.48, I can't get a vibe.
2309.48,2312.2400000000002," I mean, are you supposed to be Jack or like,"
2312.2400000000002,2314.08, they show you like someone by the hell?
2314.08,2315.08, Unknown character.
2315.08,2316.08," Yeah, you're supposed to be."
2316.08,2317.8, But he had a Jack haircut.
2317.8,2320.4, And I think they're trying to convince you that you were Jack.
2320.4,2321.96, But they were Jack like.
2321.96,2323.52, Jack like Ryan.
2323.52,2324.52, He did a music though.
2324.52,2325.52," I mean, I got excited."
2325.52,2328.12, There was some moment when you're watching that trailer.
2328.6,2332.68," And despite being a jaded gamer, you were like, all right."
2332.68,2333.88, All right.
2333.88,2335.56, Same way the people react to you and they saw the
2335.56,2336.7599999999998, and movie.
2336.7599999999998,2337.56, Not really.
2337.56,2340.8399999999997, I could try to crack the meta code in this game and see how it ties into the show.
2340.8399999999997,2344.2," You didn't have any, any mom out of."
2344.2,2348.44," Not, I mean, you know, you, like, there's lock on the screen, but he looks like some"
2348.44,2350.24, the Sawyer mirror.
2350.24,2351.44, I believe you some glass.
2351.44,2351.88, Yeah.
2351.88,2353.12, He has two characters.
2353.12,2353.88, Yeah.
2353.88,2357.4," This looks like, I mean, we didn't know if this was actually going to be a real game"
2357.4,2359.48, or like shovel where for.
2359.48,2361.32, I thought it was going to be like a stabbing.
2361.32,2362.4," Yeah, our games."
2362.4,2362.6, Yeah.
2362.6,2364.6, My first fear is going to be like one of those like CSI.
2364.6,2365.2000000000003, Yeah.
2365.2000000000003,2366.64, And some activations emerge or games.
2366.64,2368.6, And doesn't assume it's going more that way.
2368.6,2368.92, Yeah.
2368.92,2372.4," Well, it looks like the gameplay is following arrows on trees."
2372.4,2373.12, But yeah.
2373.12,2374.88," But, you know, from really just can't tell."
2374.88,2375.08, Yeah.
2375.08,2375.7200000000003," Well, there."
2375.7200000000003,2381.0," You know, it's going to be made for, you know, Walmart for, I don't"
2381.0,2383.2000000000003," know, you know, you pick up, you see, hey, lost."
2383.2000000000003,2384.32, I watched that show.
2384.32,2385.76, What could they do in this game?
2385.76,2386.76, They have my got to be a pewter.
2386.76,2389.36," You know, they're not going to, they can't answer it."
2389.36,2390.36, Of course not.
2390.36,2391.36, So that is going to be.
2391.36,2392.36, Right.
2392.36,2393.36, You can't go.
2393.36,2394.36," I mean, it's going to have to be like your say."
2394.36,2396.1600000000003, Here's this mysterious passenger.
2396.1600000000003,2400.1600000000003," And they'll write some cock and Amy story about how, you know, none of the set."
2400.1600000000003,2403.76, Why did it tell a vision series that we've all been watching didn't acknowledge the existence
2403.76,2404.76, of the other.
2404.76,2405.76, It'll be Mickey and Palo all over again.
2405.76,2406.76, Right.
2406.76,2407.76, Right.
2407.76,2408.76, It's definitely what it is.
2408.76,2409.76, Right.
2409.76,2410.76, Right.
2410.76,2412.76, The only possible solution is that we get killed at the end.
2412.76,2413.76, That's why we're not.
2414.76,2415.76, Very loud.
2415.76,2416.76, I'm hoping for.
2416.76,2417.76, Yeah.
2417.76,2421.76," What if it's not like I heard that the JJ Aims and all the people behind the show,"
2421.76,2424.76, that you're actually one of the others.
2424.76,2428.76," And everything that you see that you play and experience in the game,"
2428.76,2430.76, you're basically writing into the next season.
2430.76,2431.76," Shut up, shut up."
2433.76,2434.76, I was a little bit of a stupid.
2434.76,2435.76," No, you play."
2435.76,2437.76, You play as Jacob.
2437.76,2438.76," Oh, there you go."
2438.76,2439.76, Yeah.
2439.76,2440.76," It's like, you're going to be sort of like a great place."
2440.76,2442.76, You're sitting that chair for a spoiler.
2442.76,2444.76, I was always for last season three.
2444.76,2445.76, You play as a bad host.
2445.76,2446.76, Yeah.
2446.76,2447.76," You know, just by saying that."
2447.76,2448.76, Jacob.
2448.76,2450.76," Players, players, players, players."
2450.76,2452.76, They've been cool.
2452.76,2453.76, He got to play as the dog.
2453.76,2455.76, Jacob's like the haunted mansion ride.
2455.76,2456.76, It Disneyland.
2456.76,2458.76, Jacob is the haunted mansion ride.
2458.76,2459.76, It's the haunted mansion ride.
2459.76,2461.76, It's like a police station.
2461.76,2462.76, It's like a police station.
2462.76,2464.76, You show us a picture of your cart.
2464.76,2469.76, You show us a picture of your cart.
2469.76,2472.76, So did you see that Michael's coming back to the cast?
2472.76,2473.76, Yes.
2473.76,2475.76, I saw an angry post on court of three.
2475.76,2478.76, Some guys saying that it was bullshit that he was coming back.
2478.76,2479.76, What?
2479.76,2480.76," You know, he never got off the aisle."
2480.76,2483.76, They didn't finish his story.
2483.76,2484.76, Yeah.
2484.76,2485.76, They just put on a tubboat.
2485.76,2486.76, So it's okay.
2486.76,2487.76, Check off.
2487.76,2488.76, There's no strings attached.
2488.76,2489.76, It's not bad.
2489.76,2491.76," The bad thing is if he's still running around,"
2491.76,2492.76, scream and walk.
2492.76,2493.76," Yeah, that'd be the bad."
2493.76,2496.76," Well, even though given what happened at the end of season three,"
2496.76,2497.76," obviously, right?"
2497.76,2498.76, It doesn't.
2498.76,2499.76, You know what?
2499.76,2500.76, I'm going to say right now.
2500.76,2502.76, I think Michael's the guy in the coffin.
2502.76,2505.76, Or that I still think it's what's his face.
2505.76,2507.76," The, you know,"
2507.76,2508.76, Mark?
2508.76,2509.76," No, the leader Ben."
2509.76,2510.76, There you go.
2510.76,2511.76, Thank you.
2511.76,2512.76, It's a good song.
2512.76,2513.76, Right?
2513.76,2514.76, All right.
2514.76,2515.76, All right.
2515.76,2516.76, Now first.
2516.76,2517.76, So that game look good.
2517.76,2519.76, What the game?
2519.76,2520.76, That game look good.
2520.76,2521.76," Oh, yeah."
2521.76,2523.76, There was actually not coming to PC.
2523.76,2526.76, There's the Iron Man game trailer and Iron Man movie trailer.
2527.76,2529.76, You like how to see animation for turn in the missile round.
2529.76,2530.76, I didn't.
2530.76,2531.76," There's a game too, of course."
2531.76,2532.76, It's a game.
2532.76,2535.76," The movie trailer was kind of funny because again, I'm like,"
2535.76,2538.76, I haven't even watched for being somewhat into superheroes.
2538.76,2541.76, I haven't seen Superman movie or Hulk or.
2541.76,2542.76, I haven't seen either.
2542.76,2543.76, I didn't have much there.
2543.76,2545.76," I didn't haven't seen a lot, but I kind of was like,"
2545.76,2547.76," it looks like like down in junior,"
2547.76,2550.76, it could pull it like he could be the secret ingredient that
2550.76,2552.76, would work if it works.
2552.76,2553.76, Like it'll be on him.
2553.76,2555.76, I forgot who was told me that's what's the story.
2555.76,2557.76, Who was told me that's what someone who was down at
2557.76,2560.76, Comic Con was saying they actually watched like a extended trailer from
2560.76,2561.76, the movie.
2561.76,2562.76, They look pretty sick.
2562.76,2564.76, So they kind of run and that is super.
2564.76,2566.76," Dude, there's probably if you were someone that was"
2566.76,2568.76, that comment on like there it by the fall.
2568.76,2569.76, No way.
2569.76,2571.76," Well, that was like someone in the movie."
2571.76,2572.76, Someone in the movie.
2572.76,2575.76, For someone like the game industry at Comic Con by the fall.
2575.76,2577.76, I have a free separate conversation.
2577.76,2578.76, This is on Newt.
2578.76,2580.76, This is like a Robert Altman movie.
2580.76,2583.76," It's Nashville, the podcast."
2583.76,2585.76, This is bad because we can't hear ourselves.
2585.76,2586.76, I know.
2586.76,2587.76, We have paused for that talk.
2587.76,2591.76, I think it's probably a talk about over on this corner of the podcast.
2591.76,2592.76, We were talking about.
2592.76,2595.76," I said that they're running out of, they're starting to run out of"
2595.76,2597.76, super heroes to make movies up.
2597.76,2598.76," No, there's there's plenty."
2598.76,2600.76, And then Ryan counter that with the cat.
2600.76,2602.76, There's cat in America.
2602.76,2603.76, I went for Ryan's.
2603.76,2606.76," Before they even made, yeah, before they even got to Ironman,"
2606.76,2610.76, they made a goddamn electro movie and they made a cat woman movie.
2610.76,2612.76, So we had a little bit of a story about that.
2612.76,2614.76, I think it was a little bit of a story about that.
2614.76,2616.76, They made a terrible Captain America movie.
2616.76,2618.76, But you can't look for it.
2618.76,2619.76, Would David Hasselhoff?
2619.76,2620.76, No.
2620.76,2621.76, Straight to cable.
2621.76,2622.76, It was awesome.
2622.76,2624.76, The David Hasselhoff Nick Fury.
2624.76,2626.76," Dude, it's down here."
2626.76,2629.76, David Hasselhoff Nick Fury.
2629.76,2630.76, Yeah.
2630.76,2632.76, It's out there in the super heroes.
2632.76,2633.76, There are no problems.
2633.76,2635.76, There's the Duff Lunger and Punisher.
2635.76,2636.76," But yeah, they're all gone."
2636.76,2637.76, To Zeal.
2637.76,2639.76, All the big guys are there.
2640.76,2642.76," Again, we're having fun."
2642.76,2643.76," Again, it's happening."
2643.76,2644.76, This is the problem.
2644.76,2645.76, This is the problem.
2645.76,2646.76, This is a problem.
2646.76,2647.76, Yeah.
2647.76,2649.76, Why do we always have the equipment failures?
2649.76,2650.76, Why is it always us?
2650.76,2651.76, I suck.
2651.76,2652.76," We should just, you know, suck."
2652.76,2653.76, This is our last.
2653.76,2654.76, Last.
2654.76,2655.76, You have W Radio.
2655.76,2656.76, This is a crap.
2656.76,2658.76," Yeah, we're leaving cancer."
2658.76,2661.76," It's just, we just go continue."
2661.76,2663.76, Just discussion on our own time.
2663.76,2664.76, This is a good one.
2664.76,2665.76, How about heroes?
2665.76,2666.76, Do we have anything to say about heroes?
2666.76,2667.76, The game.
2667.76,2668.76, I'm just a little bit more special.
2668.76,2669.76, Yeah.
2669.76,2670.76, Let's do it.
2670.76,2671.76, Come on.
2671.76,2674.76, I think heroes are a better chance of being a game than lost.
2674.76,2676.76, I will say that much.
2676.76,2677.76, Yeah.
2677.76,2681.76, Because there are a bunch of different characters all with different abilities that all
2681.76,2682.76, each individual person.
2682.76,2685.76, You could play as them and they would that would be cool.
2685.76,2688.76, I don't think they'd have to make up a hero for you to be.
2688.76,2691.76," My only fear is that they'd focus on like, like, like, the route with like,"
2691.76,2696.76, X2 Wolverines revenge and focus on one guy and your stuck planks on crap ass plot with.
2696.76,2697.76," Yeah, I don't know."
2697.76,2699.76, Have they said anything at all about it?
2699.76,2701.76, Just the fact is going to be one.
2701.76,2706.76, Biggest seen the guy who plays sila got cast as Mr. Spock in the start.
2706.76,2709.76, I think he's the worst thing ever.
2709.76,2711.76, But that's pretty cool.
2711.76,2713.76, Has anyone played the battle star game?
2713.76,2714.76, Was that a E3?
2714.76,2715.76, That scares me.
2715.76,2716.76, Yeah.
2716.76,2718.76, That was not really a battle star game.
2718.76,2719.76, Lots of heroes are okay.
2719.76,2720.76, But battle star game.
2720.76,2721.76, I don't want battle star.
2721.76,2722.76, I don't want battle star.
2722.76,2723.76, Okay.
2723.76,2724.76, I will lead by a game.
2724.76,2725.76, Keep your game too.
2725.76,2726.76, Keep your game too.
2726.76,2727.76, From battle strike.
2727.76,2729.76, I like to go too high for looting for that.
2729.76,2730.76, Right.
2730.76,2731.76, Yeah.
2731.76,2733.76, This is television literature.
2733.76,2734.76, Exactly.
2734.76,2735.76, That's a low-brow art.
2735.76,2737.76, It'd be like a dead-wood game or the wire game.
2737.76,2739.76, Don't mess with that dead-wood game.
2739.76,2742.76," Really, it'd be like cursing in the old West."
2742.76,2743.76, That'd be awesome.
2743.76,2744.76," What, Sean?"
2744.76,2748.76," I just, this whole time I'm realizing we've been talking over one another."
2748.76,2750.76," No, it's that one part."
2750.76,2753.76, It was just a second ago we were just doing it.
2753.76,2754.76, I think it was funny each other?
2754.76,2755.76, I don't know more than usual.
2755.76,2756.76, I hate it.
2756.76,2757.76, You've done it.
2757.76,2758.76, You ain't saying it word.
2758.76,2760.76," No, but yeah."
2760.76,2763.76, Someone brought up the battle star game.
2763.76,2764.76, Yeah.
2764.76,2765.76," I saw it at E3, anyone else?"
2765.76,2766.76, No.
2766.76,2768.76, Is it just like ship combat?
2768.76,2769.76, It's ship combat.
2769.76,2771.76, It's like a top-down shooter kind of game.
2771.76,2773.76, You don't need to knock pit or anything.
2773.76,2774.76, Okay.
2774.76,2776.76, I don't get to have dialogue trees with O'Dama.
2776.76,2777.76, No.
2777.76,2778.76, No.
2778.76,2779.76, Is it an Xbox live game?
2779.76,2781.76, It's an Xbox live arcade game.
2781.76,2782.76, They'll talk about bringing it to the PC.
2782.76,2785.76," Well, actually, I think they are thinking about bringing it to the PC."
2785.76,2786.76, Yeah.
2786.76,2787.76, That sounds like it.
2787.76,2789.76," But basically, it's on the talking like 1942."
2789.76,2794.76," Or kind of kind of, it's just kind of like actually, it's like wind commander arena actually."
2794.76,2796.76, That'll sort of mod a basic.
2796.76,2797.76, Yeah.
2797.76,2798.76," Basically, it's just kind of like top-down shooting."
2798.76,2799.76, You have like teams.
2799.76,2802.76, You can have a single player campaign against bots.
2802.76,2803.76, What did you do?
2803.76,2805.76, I just are the characters in it.
2805.76,2806.76, The main characters.
2806.76,2807.76, I don't think so.
2807.76,2808.76, No.
2808.76,2809.76," It make, okay."
2810.76,2812.76, They quit from inside their car pits.
2812.76,2814.76," If I think,"
2814.76,2816.76," If I think, guys, ball-tower, I'm out."
2816.76,2823.76," Any game that starts off with like, I'll be your TV license already is dropped down a peg before I even know anything about it."
2823.76,2824.76," Hey, check."
2824.76,2825.76, You know what?
2825.76,2828.76, You've got a NASA Comic Con that will be cool.
2828.76,2829.76, Web.
2829.76,2830.76, Lego Indiana Jones.
2830.76,2831.76," Oh, didn't see no that look."
2831.76,2832.76, Yeah.
2832.76,2833.76, I agree.
2833.76,2834.76, That's right.
2834.76,2835.76, Is that coming to the PC?
2835.76,2836.76," Shons like oh, god."
2836.76,2837.76, I think so.
2837.76,2838.76," I mean, yet it won't show."
2838.76,2839.76, That's a good idea.
2839.76,2843.76," That to me is like the people that like send me like, like, role videos."
2843.76,2844.76, You get it.
2844.76,2846.76, It's Lego into me and Jones.
2846.76,2847.76, It's great.
2847.76,2848.76, It's the one words.
2848.76,2850.76, It is Lego.
2850.76,2852.76," Hey, it's the one words."
2852.76,2853.76, Lego Star Wars.
2853.76,2856.76," No, it looks like a dumb fucking platformer."
2856.76,2857.76, Lego Star Wars.
2857.76,2858.76, I don't know.
2858.76,2859.76, I haven't even played it.
2859.76,2860.76, I've watched people play it.
2860.76,2861.76, It looks cool.
2861.76,2863.76, Lego makes anything bad cool.
2863.76,2867.76," Because you can, you can turn what you don't understand is it's not just a kid even here."
2867.76,2871.76, You can manipulate the world because it's constructed of legos.
2871.76,2872.76," I just, I just kind of curious."
2872.76,2874.76, Is there like a Lego MMO coming up?
2874.76,2875.76, Yes.
2875.76,2876.76, Yeah.
2876.76,2877.76, Because I know like net doubles working on that.
2877.76,2878.76, Yes.
2878.76,2879.76, Yes.
2879.76,2880.76, They are.
2880.76,2881.76, It makes it a lot.
2881.76,2882.76, I'm not going to exactly.
2882.76,2883.76, The sky is the limit.
2883.76,2886.76," But Lego MMO is going to be like, how about hotels?"
2886.76,2888.76," Now, this is the guy who made Auto Assault."
2888.76,2891.76," See, if they had done Auto Assault out of Lego,"
2891.76,2893.76, it probably still be running today.
2893.76,2895.76, It definitely was still running.
2896.76,2898.76," Like, by the way, we haven't brought that up since."
2898.76,2902.76," But you know, it's still on like we talked once on this podcast about how we are going to make a"
2902.76,2905.76," counts and you know, be revving our engines as the lights go down on."
2905.76,2907.76, I don't think it's making a count.
2907.76,2908.76," Oh, really?"
2908.76,2909.76, I didn't quite about this.
2909.76,2912.76," I totally, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I don't want to do this."
2912.76,2914.76," Like, you know, right off into the sunset kind of thing."
2914.76,2916.76," They do, they're not trying to get PR."
2916.76,2917.76," For, you know, the fact that it's cool."
2917.76,2919.76," And the thing on the business,"
2919.76,2920.76, will fail your coming.
2920.76,2921.76, Come MMO.
2921.76,2922.76, I still have any count.
2922.76,2923.76, I can get in there.
2924.76,2925.76, Yeah.
2925.76,2926.76, Get in there and take some screen.
2926.76,2927.76," It goes marauders, man."
2927.76,2928.76, We ride.
2928.76,2929.76, Please.
2929.76,2930.76, How we roll.
2930.76,2931.76," My name and, uh,"
2931.76,2933.76, I'm a familiar rossler for the world.
2933.76,2935.76," If anyone else is in the beta wants to say hi, I'm so you lead."
2935.76,2937.76, So you lead here.
2937.76,2938.76," So you leash,"
2938.76,2939.76," Oh, bea."
2939.76,2940.76, I'm not a runner.
2940.76,2941.76, I'm a runner.
2941.76,2942.76," Oh, bea."
2942.76,2943.76, So you lead.
2943.76,2944.76," Oh, bea."
2944.76,2945.76, That's who it is.
2945.76,2946.76, Part of the family.
2946.76,2947.76," And, uh,"
2947.76,2948.76, the tremendous.
2948.76,2950.76, We get a whole team.
2950.76,2952.76," Well, that's because it comes from the,"
2952.76,2955.76," the big fun series when we play in, uh,"
2955.76,2957.76," company heroes, which, oh, by the way,"
2957.76,2958.76," once that went on steam,"
2958.76,2961.76, just massively reinvigorated the online community.
2961.76,2962.76, Is that right?
2962.76,2963.76, Yeah.
2963.76,2964.76, You look in it.
2964.76,2966.76, It was to a point where you'd go on to play in their own way.
2966.76,2967.76," Like, I don't know."
2967.76,2968.76," I'm sure I'm getting it wrong,"
2968.76,2969.76," but, you know, maybe like a thousand."
2969.76,2971.76, And now it's like way way more.
2971.76,2972.76," Hopefully, you know,"
2972.76,2974.76, orders of magnitude ten times as many people.
2974.76,2975.76, I'm thinking about this team.
2975.76,2976.76," Do you know if you, I would think about,"
2976.76,2978.76, I'm going to check this after work.
2978.76,2979.76," But is it possible if you, like,"
2979.76,2980.76," like, let's say I have, like a company here,"
2980.76,2982.76," for example, I don't want to carry the discount anymore."
2982.76,2984.76," If you bought the retailer,"
2984.76,2985.76, if you can use them.
2985.76,2986.76," If I use my cereal code on steam,"
2986.76,2987.76, and then I haven't tried.
2987.76,2989.76," I'm guessing not,"
2989.76,2991.76," but that would sure be nice though, wouldn't it?"
2991.76,2992.76, Sure.
2992.76,2993.76, Yeah. I want to ditch my business.
2993.76,2994.76, So it props to Valve.
2994.76,2995.76, Check this out.
2995.76,2997.76," Uh, this is,"
2997.76,2999.76," you know,"
2999.76,3000.76," I first everyone was like,"
3000.76,3002.76," uh, I don't know what to think about this."
3002.76,3006.76," And this being that Valve decided that you can't just buy,"
3006.76,3009.76," um, the strip down black box or whatever it is of episode two,"
3009.76,3012.76," that you have to get the whole orange box that comes with,"
3012.76,3013.76," um,"
3013.76,3014.76," Half-Life 2,"
3014.76,3015.76, Half-Life 2 episode 1.
3015.76,3016.76, Right.
3016.76,3018.76," Episode 2 and all this other stuff, and you're like,"
3018.76,3019.76," but the thing is,"
3019.76,3021.76, this is not costing you any more really.
3021.76,3022.76, It's still a value.
3022.76,3024.76," Even if, if it didn't have those,"
3024.76,3026.76," it would still be a value for team forcers 2,"
3026.76,3028.76, which they could so easily charge full retail for.
3028.76,3029.76, Yeah.
3029.76,3030.76," With the, the history,"
3030.76,3032.76," the legacy of that game,"
3032.76,3034.76," um, and then portal and then episode."
3034.76,3035.76," But the thing is,"
3035.76,3036.76," is that now if you buy it,"
3036.76,3038.76," and you've already got them,"
3038.76,3039.76," you get codes for them,"
3039.76,3041.76, and you can give them to anyone you want.
3041.76,3043.76," So you can, you know, remotely."
3043.76,3044.76," So it's like say,"
3044.76,3045.76," I buy this box,"
3045.76,3046.76," and I'm like,"
3046.76,3047.76, I don't need Half-Life 2.
3047.76,3048.76, I don't need episode.
3048.76,3049.76," Episode 1,"
3049.76,3050.76," I can just tell my friend,"
3050.76,3051.76," and he's like,"
3051.76,3052.76, I don't know where whatever.
3052.76,3053.76," Hey, check this out,"
3053.76,3054.76," and he gets an email and then boom,"
3054.76,3055.76, he's got those two games.
3055.76,3056.76, I just thought that was crazy.
3056.76,3057.76, How many games did that?
3057.76,3058.76," Half-Life 2,"
3058.76,3059.76, It just points.
3059.76,3060.76, You can just pick up some of these.
3060.76,3061.76, A lot of people.
3061.76,3062.76, Yeah.
3062.76,3063.76, I was just talking to someone who was just playing it.
3063.76,3065.76, Robert Ashley of freelance is for us.
3065.76,3067.76," It was just playing it for the first time,"
3067.76,3069.76, and it was just past month.
3069.76,3070.76," So,"
3070.76,3071.76," yeah,"
3071.76,3073.76," it takes a lot of people to wild upgrade their computers, you know?"
3073.76,3074.76," Yeah, exactly it."
3074.76,3075.76, Yeah.
3075.76,3077.76," You can still download the pieces of ice by a steam, right?"
3077.76,3078.76," If you don't want those,"
3078.76,3080.76, if you don't want to go retail.
3080.76,3081.76, Right.
3081.76,3082.76," Yeah, you can get that stuff."
3082.76,3083.76, Yeah.
3083.76,3084.76," So, go steam."
3084.76,3086.76, I think that's probably just another way to promote.
3086.76,3089.76," Well, actually, it's another way to promote their,"
3089.76,3090.76, their game.
3090.76,3091.76," I mean,"
3091.76,3092.76, it's so annoying.
3092.76,3093.76," But it's still cool though that you don't,"
3093.76,3094.76," you know,"
3094.76,3095.76," you're not stuck with just something you can't,"
3095.76,3096.76," you have another version of these,"
3096.76,3099.76, and I can install it on whatever computer I own or whatever.
3099.76,3100.76," It's like,"
3100.76,3101.76, that was pretty cool.
3101.76,3103.76," But still the,"
3103.76,3105.76," I mean, the black box version would have been nice though."
3105.76,3106.76, Don't you think?
3106.76,3109.76, I think if they had never announced the other version that they canceled.
3109.76,3110.76," Yeah,"
3110.76,3111.76, I know what it would have been like.
3111.76,3112.76, I thought on it.
3112.76,3113.76," Like,"
3113.76,3114.76, Yeah.
3114.76,3115.76, Yeah.
3115.76,3116.76, I'm getting these games that can.
3116.76,3117.76," Right, because it has a little bit of the,"
3117.76,3118.76," the width of,"
3118.76,3120.76, but I actually want you to buy them more expensive one
3120.76,3122.76, and never mind the cheap one.
3122.76,3123.76, Mm-hmm.
3123.76,3124.76, It's because an option was taken away.
3124.76,3125.76," It's not just a way, but it's still like you said."
3125.76,3126.76, It's hard.
3126.76,3127.76, It is.
3127.76,3128.76, Yeah.
3128.76,3129.76," Like you said, it's still a crazy bargain."
3129.76,3130.76, Yeah.
3130.76,3131.76, Yeah.
3131.76,3133.76," It was interesting to see Robert play this for the first time,"
3133.76,3135.76, because it just totally reminded me.
3135.76,3136.76," If you know when you, when you,"
3136.76,3137.76," you have some favorite thing like,"
3137.76,3138.76," you know,"
3138.76,3139.76," preacher comic,"
3139.76,3140.76, I'm really fond of it.
3140.76,3141.76, And it seems like every year I hook someone else on it.
3141.76,3143.76, Although it might have been like years and years since I've read it.
3143.76,3146.76, But it's always kind of like cool to vicariously relive like when you first read it.
3146.76,3148.76," As they keep coming back,"
3148.76,3149.76," he like,"
3149.76,3150.76," Oh, shit."
3150.76,3151.76, What about this part?
3151.76,3152.76, What's up with according to Jim?
3152.76,3154.76," Every time he walks on one of the wards,"
3154.76,3156.76, the comedic stylings of Jim Belushi for the first time.
3156.76,3157.76, Yeah.
3157.76,3159.76, They ride get really happy for them.
3159.76,3160.76, No.
3160.76,3163.76, And he walks there and so he'll get sucked out into the TV.
3163.76,3165.76," That made me sad, Jeff."
3165.76,3166.76, I'm sorry.
3166.76,3167.76, I didn't get it.
3167.76,3168.76, I haven't seen it.
3168.76,3169.76, Yeah.
3169.76,3170.76," It's just, I don't ever have to."
3170.76,3171.76, I understand that.
3171.76,3172.76, Yeah.
3172.76,3173.76, It's not video games.
3173.76,3174.76, I don't know anything about it.
3174.76,3176.76, But the Jim might be great.
3176.76,3178.76," Oh, hey, I'm not in the register."
3178.76,3180.76," Oh, according to Jim, that's that shit,"
3180.76,3181.76," shit, com?"
3181.76,3182.26, Yeah.
3182.26,3183.26, They did a state of priority.
3183.26,3184.26, I heard about that.
3184.26,3185.26, I watched it.
3185.26,3186.26, Yeah.
3186.26,3189.26, I just went to the throw up before I forget.
3189.26,3191.26, Just bring a speaking of valve.
3191.26,3192.26," For anyone who's in the Dallas area,"
3192.26,3193.26, you go in a quake on the sweet.
3193.26,3195.26, They're going to be letting people play left for dead.
3195.26,3196.26," Oh, cool."
3196.26,3198.26, So they're going to be on display there.
3198.26,3200.26," I think you can't just be on the Dallas area, right?"
3200.26,3202.26," You have to have, well, I mean, like,"
3202.26,3203.26, past to get in.
3203.26,3204.26, Yeah.
3204.26,3205.26," I mean, it's worth checking out for that."
3205.26,3206.26, How much they charge for this past?
3206.26,3208.26, I don't know how much they charge for the thing these days.
3208.26,3211.26, But there's a lot of developers showing up for these things now.
3211.26,3212.26, I want to go to the field.
3212.26,3214.26, I wanted to go to Comic Con this year.
3214.26,3218.26," Reminded me of because, uh, went to high school in San Diego."
3218.26,3222.26, We used to always go down there and buy people's passes for a dollar as they were leaving.
3222.26,3225.26," And then go in and then whatever we'd have the,"
3225.26,3227.26," the misfortune of going to a booth and the guys says,"
3227.26,3230.26," Oh, yeah, you're from, uh, San Luis Obispo."
3230.26,3232.26," My, my son goes to high school out there."
3232.26,3235.26," What, what school you going to have to make this in?"
3235.26,3236.26, I'm just going to start.
3236.26,3237.26, Just move there.
3237.26,3238.26, Not being.
3238.26,3240.26," But that told me not to talk to strangers,"
3240.26,3241.26, especially at the Comic Con.
3241.26,3244.26," And that was, especially when dressed as Boba Fett."
3244.26,3249.26," The Comic Con was like legit, but it will legitly like fuck back."
3249.26,3251.26, Back before the whole world got screwed up.
3251.26,3257.26," Like, I remember going upstairs there and they had like rooms just where they play anime."
3257.26,3260.26, And I remember opening the door one of those motherfuckers.
3260.26,3261.26," Oh, no."
3261.26,3262.26, It closed in that door.
3262.26,3263.26," Oh, my."
3263.26,3264.26, It was like a hen type.
3264.26,3267.26," It's just cracking up because I was like, so this is like, you know,"
3267.26,3269.26, I've been writing to 93.
3269.26,3270.26, It's just bad.
3270.26,3272.26," Now it's like, they've taken over the world."
3272.26,3273.26," No, it's big time."
3273.26,3274.26, There's a cartoon.
3274.26,3275.26, I just heard about coming out.
3275.26,3276.26," No, it's already out."
3276.26,3278.26, It's called the Stormhawks.
3278.26,3280.26, And why am I talking about?
3280.26,3281.26, I know.
3281.26,3282.26, I don't know.
3282.26,3283.26, I actually see in the commercials for this.
3283.26,3284.26, I'll tell you about Stormhawks.
3284.26,3286.26," Well, when we always, in our here, the web,"
3286.26,3290.26," we always, we'll not always, but it's common that we have furries and people that"
3290.26,3295.26, fetishize game characters and animals and all this kind of stuff.
3295.26,3300.26," And at some point, I was wondering, like, okay, what if there's just, you know,"
3300.26,3304.26, I'll have this to entertain this conspiracy theory and say that the people that make the
3304.26,3308.26," Sonic games and stuff, not the first on, but the sequels and the sequels of the sequels say,"
3308.26,3313.26," hey, we understand that a big portion of our audience is into this kind of stuff."
3313.26,3316.26," Like, let's cater to them a little bit into it."
3316.26,3318.26," You mean, like, into it into it."
3318.26,3322.26," Yeah, like wanting to get into their problems with Sonic wanting to really get into their characters."
3322.26,3323.26, That's not a problem.
3324.26,3328.26," So anyway, like, along with that, I kind of like entertained that put inside it."
3328.26,3330.26, Now there's this show called Stormhawks.
3330.26,3333.26," And if you look at it, I swear to God, it's straight up there."
3333.26,3337.26," This, someone said, hey, that's a lucrative market."
3337.26,3340.26, There's people that like that shit and we're going to like give it to them.
3340.26,3345.26," So they have, like, a whole part of the huge cast are straight up furries."
3345.26,3348.26," It's not, and I, when I say furry, I don't mean like,"
3349.26,3350.26," that my reaction guy's,"
3350.26,3355.26," bugs bunny and shit, you know, where, you know, it's like that's a body and that's like a body with like dynamite,"
3355.26,3356.26, when I was asked.
3356.26,3360.26," But they're like people, they're, they're very like highly anthropomorphized animals."
3360.26,3362.26," But yeah, this shows loaded with them."
3362.26,3365.26," So what we did is we're like, okay, are we just being like freaks,"
3365.26,3369.26, are might be becoming like the jack Thompson of the furry generation?
3369.26,3371.26, So what are we doing?
3371.26,3372.26, Tell the banner to hold their.
3372.26,3376.26," Is I Googled, I Googled furry, plus Stormhawks,"
3376.26,3378.26, and what do you know?
3378.26,3382.26," Almost everything that comes up, it's like furry forms and stuff and their favorite things."
3382.26,3385.26," There's like little box on the side, what are your favorite things in this world?"
3385.26,3390.26," Stormhawks is, wow, a very, very common, common favorite."
3390.26,3392.26," So basically if your kids are watching Stormhawks, there's a smoking gun."
3392.26,3394.26," You're warning, so that's the smoke that you got."
3394.26,3396.26, You smoke the jack Thompson of you are a toon for this.
3396.26,3400.26," Just wondering, because it's like, at the point of view,"
3400.26,3403.26, the details are turning our kids in the furry.
3403.26,3405.26," It's fine, a final fancy, catering."

3434.26,3436.26, and I had to take that thing out of my machine.

3453.26,3455.26, of love dolls in his house.
3455.26,3458.26," And besides that, he doesn't need a real woman,"
