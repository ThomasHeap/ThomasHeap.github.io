0.0,6.08, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio's 100th podcast.
6.08,8.16," Actually, this is not podcast."
8.16,10.8, You're gonna have to come back next week for the 100th podcast.
10.8,15.52," Because the usual leader of GFW Radio, Jeffrey Green,"
15.52,17.28, is out sick this week.
17.28,19.36," And other things have prevented us from taping,"
19.36,21.12, even though we're sitting here taping right now.
21.12,23.12, So you know we're lying to your asses.
23.12,25.68, And this is Sean and I'll be speaking by the way.
25.68,27.92, I'm here with Ryan Scott.
27.92,30.8, And Sean Malay because we need an intro for an announcement.
30.8,31.28, And right.
31.28,33.04, So Jeff is sick.
33.04,34.32, Proof of his sickness.
34.32,36.0, I hold in my hand right here.
37.2,39.92, He and I have been working on what was supposed to be a new promo
39.92,40.64, for the podcast.
41.28,44.32," Zudy, Granny, put together what he dubbed an old school beat"
44.32,45.760000000000005, at Jeff's request.
45.760000000000005,48.24," Jeff wanted some Eric B. Rock, him style shit."
48.24,51.52, So he could spit a promo rap.
52.160000000000004,54.400000000000006, And he sent me some of his lyrics that he was working on.
55.28,57.6," And what I saw was that one, he was sick."
58.32,62.480000000000004, And that too there's no way this is going to fly with an EIC
62.480000000000004,65.76, saying this shit on the promo that appears on all of our podcasts.
65.76,67.12, So what'll probably happen?
67.12,70.8," I'm not going to read it all because that will, I don't want to spoil it"
70.8,73.6, because we'll probably make it just like an intro or a skip for the
73.6,75.52000000000001, art or a regular episode.
75.52000000000001,77.76, Maybe next week if Jeff gets well.
77.76,80.4, But so he sends me his sample lyrics.
80.4,81.76," He's all getting excited, which is awesome."
81.76,82.8, I can't wait to hear this.
84.16,86.4," But the lyrics though, some of them go like this."
87.12,88.4, Would you have to have a you bitch?
88.4,90.08000000000001, We got a fan's by the thousands.
90.08000000000001,92.48," We take our girlies in the bed like so many takes Shane,"
92.48,93.28," Betten, Housing."
94.24000000000001,96.24000000000001, And wow.
96.80000000000001,99.44000000000001, Turn based work game stack that units on the hexes.
99.44000000000001,102.56, Why don't you bend it over backwards and let me show you now what sex is.
104.56,106.08000000000001, So Jeff wrote that?
106.08000000000001,106.24000000000001, Yeah.
107.28,108.32000000000001, That came from Jeff.
108.32000000000001,113.12," And I was, I was saying, well, I actually haven't written my part yet."
113.12,115.52000000000001," But I was, I was going to write it like the whole snares"
115.6,118.08, his mom and his daughter coming into his bedroom and catching
118.08,121.84, a recording his his shit because he's going to have to record his lines at home.
121.84,124.72," He, I gave him the copy of the beat and I told him it's like play it."
125.75999999999999,130.48," Rapp that your microphone stay on beat, send it over to the producer and he'll put it"
130.48,130.96, together.
130.96,134.56, But you got to imagine like you're just wife and you walk in the room.
135.51999999999998,137.84, And you hear your husband saying these things.
138.64,139.76, Add his computer screen.
140.64,144.24, So that's only one one form of Jeff's sickness.
144.56,147.28," He's Sean, you know more than all the rest of us."
147.28,148.96, He's got some of the bad guys in the super flu.
149.76000000000002,152.08, So it's pretty serious.
152.08,155.28," And the rest of us too, we just am in plain enough games this week."
155.28,156.56, It's been a busy week.
156.56,160.88," We just happens now and then yeah, you can hear me talk about all the work"
160.88,162.4, after if you want it then I'll think you want to do that.
162.4,162.8, Right.
162.8,165.76000000000002, You'll be able to hear that on legendary thread.
166.0,168.8, You guys taped something sounds pretty cool for retranauts.
168.8,169.92000000000002, Is that already out now?
170.8,172.48000000000002, Because I'm out when you hear it's out tomorrow.
173.11999999999998,175.11999999999998, Sin series anything with Simon front of it.
175.67999999999998,178.56, It didn't accept can't sin tower apparently.
178.56,179.51999999999998," Yes, we miss some tower."
181.28,182.88, That's an oversight. I can't forgive.
183.92,187.44, It's not I'll be on one of yours and come in on a Friday.
187.44,188.07999999999998, Oh boy.
189.04,189.67999999999998, That about.
191.76,194.16," Well, they take in sounds since we're about anything can you rhyme?"
195.44,196.07999999999998," Sure, I can."
196.07999999999998,199.28, All these we joke about we we never have any preparation.
199.36,202.8," You I mean and we rarely have any real preparation for the show, but"
202.8,206.32, at the same time I try to play games at least in preparation for it.
206.32,209.68," And so just because of you know, I was doing a few other things this week."
209.68,211.12, It didn't get much time to catch up.
211.12,212.24, But I'm now in mythos.
212.24,216.4," So next week on GFW, we'll talk in that and I can get you guys accounts if you want to try."
216.4,219.12," Oh, I'll yeah, I'm trying that for third version just came out."
219.92000000000002,223.52, And then I have to play some more games for one of yours.
223.52,224.08, Yours.
224.56,225.36, The battlefield.
225.92000000000002,226.64," Okay, that's out."
226.64,228.24, The longest announcement ever.
228.32000000000002,228.88," Yeah, send."
228.88,230.0, Send Jeff. Sorry.
230.0,231.68," If you play well, send them pair of pies."
232.08,233.52, The account is eggbird.
234.08,234.72, Not just sentiment.
234.72,235.44, I'll get well now.
235.44,237.76000000000002, Two is in box and one up farms or whatever.
238.96,239.76000000000002, He'll need it.
239.76000000000002,240.88, He'll appreciate it.
241.20000000000002,243.52, He'll be he'll be he's probably online looking right now.
243.52,245.76000000000002," Yeah, they better be pissed off that there's no show this week."
246.96,251.68, So Ryan you got to like a five of one minute version of your input for the podcast.
254.0,256.56, Lost one don't oh God.
257.28000000000003,258.96, You know you want to get me started on long.
258.96,262.56," Dude, we can do a quick version of the theory of time bullets."
263.36,264.72," Yeah, we got to talk about it."
264.72,265.04," Okay, so."
265.04,265.2, So.
265.2,266.64, It's a spoiler zone.
267.44,268.8, And you want to turn this shit.
268.8,270.96, You didn't want to turn this on in the first place.
270.96,272.0," Yeah, being out for the time."
272.0,274.0," Yeah, if you haven't already turned this crap off."
274.0,277.2," Yeah, this podcast is over, but we're just going to say and talk for one more minute."
277.2,280.32," So last week show the characters Carl,"
281.04,283.44, who I know is the Habsburg lip.
284.16,285.84000000000003," And, uh, Danielle."
286.64,287.6, We're shot.
287.6,288.24, Yeah.
288.24,294.0, And it was it was edited in such a way that you can't tell who or under what specific circumstance
294.0,294.64, they're shot.
294.64,300.32, And that is left some people to speculate according to what I'm calling a time bullets theory.
300.64,302.8," And because it's been established that on the island,"
303.76,306.16, there's some sort of temporal nominally surrounding it.
306.16,309.04," You know, when they shot the rocket in, it was off time."
309.04,313.6," It took you know, however many minutes longer to arrive in it out to a 31 minutes."
313.6,314.4, Oh God.
315.35999999999996,316.4," Thanks, Ryan."
316.4,318.08, So 31 minutes.
318.08,323.52," Now, giving that that they took the time to establish something like that."
323.52,326.56," People are saying, well, the guys that were shooting clay, you know,"
326.56,330.47999999999996, clay is off of the ship off the freighter that it was their bullets.
331.12,332.0, The time bullets.
332.0,332.56, The time bullets.
332.56,334.96," The heads, the time bullets that landed on the island."
334.96,335.67999999999995, Really?
335.67999999999995,336.96, And they're serious about it.
336.96,339.35999999999996," And they've actually edited, you know, gifts,"
339.35999999999996,344.23999999999995," dot gift files together, splicing the two scenes, showing you that like every"
344.32,349.76," pause and the fire that you could see in the final scene is like perfectly, you know, coordinated with any,"
349.76,352.40000000000003," you know, reloading and stuff that's going on in the scene on the boat."
353.44,354.40000000000003," Of course, it's totally stupid."
354.40000000000003,357.12," The first thing you're like, well, MP5 can't doesn't have that right."
357.12,358.96000000000004," I mean, do the idea of shooting an MP."
358.96000000000004,360.96000000000004, You can't even see land from the boat.
360.96000000000004,362.24, So it's not just time bullets.
362.24,364.96000000000004, It's like gravitation or magnetism.
364.96000000000004,365.92, Tets are actors on them.
367.92,373.2," And then, of course, everyone else is pulled, you know, stills from that scene where, you know,"
373.2,376.4, the assassination scene where you could see people moving around in the bushes.
376.4,377.84, You can actually see this silhouette.
377.84,382.0," And then there's some guy who like, he had a close up of the dude, like whatever the person"
382.0,385.52," should shoulder whatever he's like, there's a dorm of logo right there on the shoulder."
385.52,387.76, There's like a little patch of white.
387.76,388.71999999999997, I did the dummy.
388.71999999999997,389.52, Maybe like one of those sharks.
390.71999999999997,391.91999999999996, It could have been the shark.
391.91999999999996,394.56," It could have been, it could have been what's his name Vincent."
394.56,394.88, Yeah.
394.88,395.52, Yeah.
395.52,396.15999999999997, Oh.
397.12,402.48," So, and we have all the, I mean, we're like, we mean, me and Ryan,"
402.48,405.6," we're just like, well, Ben wants both of those people dead."
406.48,410.32, And that's makes perfect sense that if he's in contact with any of the other authors.
411.04,412.48, Guy liner among them.
412.48,413.84000000000003, Guy liner forget his name.
413.84000000000003,416.0, But he was pirate man.
416.0,417.44, His name is Richard Alpert.
417.44,418.0, Yeah.
418.0,419.28000000000003, So it's probably Guy liner.
419.28000000000003,425.12," And he, that guy, that actor, he left the show to do another show for a different"
425.12,426.48," network, which got canceled."
426.48,428.56, I believe as part of the writer's strike.
428.56,430.16, And so he's going to be back on last.
431.12,432.08000000000004, So there we go.
432.08000000000004,432.88000000000005, That's him.
432.88000000000005,434.0, Glad story continuity.
434.0,434.40000000000003, Can exist.
436.40000000000003,437.44, There's something else to say about.
437.44,437.92," Oh, yeah."
437.92,440.8, In the process of before I had it confirmed.
440.8,445.6, And I saw that the animated clip showing that the people were moving around in the bushes
445.6,447.20000000000005, at the side of the murder.
447.20000000000005,448.0, Mm-hmm.
448.0,450.16," I was arguing with Roy, who's like a time."
450.16,451.44000000000005, He's the time bullet.
451.44000000000005,452.08000000000004, Time light.
452.08000000000004,455.44000000000005," We're going to, and we're really curious about the real."
455.44000000000005,456.24," Oh, it's yes."
456.24,459.04," As far as I can tell, he's, that's what he believes happened."
459.04,460.16, He doesn't want it to be.
460.16,461.6, And he thinks it's totally stupid.
461.6,464.8, But he's in the point where he doesn't like to show anymore.
464.8,466.64000000000004, So he's looking for reasons to hate it.
466.64000000000004,467.04, Right.
467.04,468.24, So I think that's what he's like.
468.24,469.04, Yeah.
469.04,470.24, Yeah.
470.24,473.76000000000005," But I was, I stupidly went to the lost forums."
473.76000000000005,475.92, The official ones just to see.
475.92,477.44, Because I figured they would track all this.
477.44,479.76," That this is the place to go when you want to find the, you know,"
479.76,480.72, steals from the show.
480.72,482.32000000000005," Oh, I'll give you the place to go for that."
484.32000000000005,484.72, Sign up.
484.72,485.6, I'll give you a message.
485.6,488.08000000000004, I'll give you a better place to go for that.
488.15999999999997,488.96, Okay.
488.96,490.08, You could send me then.
491.44,495.68," And on this forum, it's kind of like the version of every form I guess."
495.68,498.88," But I was just surprised to see like, you have signatures and forms."
498.88,499.28, Mm-hmm.
499.28,503.03999999999996, And it would be like pictures of Vincent and it would just say like Vincent forever.
503.03999999999996,504.96," And then there's all these ones of couples, you know?"
504.96,507.44, It's like either a picture of like Jack and Kate together.
508.4,511.28," Or like, um, what's his name?"
511.28,511.91999999999996, Sawyer.
511.91999999999996,513.36, Sawyer and Kate together.
513.36,516.4, And then all these like poetic lines about true love and shit.
518.1600000000001,518.96, I don't know man.
518.96,520.08, It is.
520.08,522.0," It is the theories they're talking about like,"
522.0,524.1600000000001," I mean, just anything that happened on the show."
524.1600000000001,524.64, It didn't matter.
524.64,527.44, Like someone did you notice the so-and-socks had to stay on it.
527.44,531.2800000000001," And then there'll be like 10,000 words devoted to figuring out how like that there."
532.0,533.5200000000001, It was like the mind of madness.
533.5200000000001,534.1600000000001," Well, I showed you."
534.1600000000001,534.32, I showed you.
534.32,535.84, I lent you guys to that theory.
535.84,539.0400000000001, I'm always going off the bat as like the pinnacle of insane theories.
539.0400000000001,542.1600000000001," The one with like lock where the dude thinks that like lock is a,"
543.36,545.6, a death throwing me and he's like on the electric chair.
545.6,547.84, And he's imagining all this stuff while he's frying.
547.84,550.88, And like all these characters are aspects of like lock's personality.
550.88,552.0, And that was a John Q.
552.0,552.48, Zach movie.
553.6,555.12," Yeah, well, apparently."
555.12,555.2800000000001, The bad.
555.2800000000001,559.0400000000001, According to this very devoted fan who's written about eight billion words about it.
559.0400000000001,560.1600000000001, That's lost as well.
560.1600000000001,560.96, A preferred.
560.96,564.64," If it turned out to be the same plot as identity, I'm going to close one."
564.64,566.88," The version of this, this that I prefers."
566.88,574.08, There's a photograph of a bunch of people and some Florida carlot that have come because of an image
574.08,576.64, of the version appeared on one of their windows.
576.72,580.72," And of course, what it was is that the sprinklers for the palm trees around the lot"
581.52,586.4, were hitting the window and it crazed whatever the acetate sheet or whatever they had to block
