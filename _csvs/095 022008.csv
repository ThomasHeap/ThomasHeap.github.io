0.0,4.28, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio.
4.28,9.36, This is Jeff Green from GFW Magazine and I'm here with the full editorial crew today and
9.36,15.72, two special guests who are giving us a little chunk of their time from today graciously
15.72,21.52, in the spizzy conference and as I did yesterday I'm going to let the men introduce themselves.
21.52,22.72, Starting with you sir.
22.72,25.36," Hello, Chris Taylor."
25.36,27.64," I'm a CEO founder, Gasparard Games."
27.64,34.64," Great to be here on this fine, fine, exhausting with the afternoon."
34.64,38.64, Yeah and I'm Josh from Skara Design Director at Rullock.
38.64,41.480000000000004, One of the guys responsible for company heroes.
41.480000000000004,43.08, Were you like lead designer?
43.08,44.08, Yeah.
44.08,45.08," You know, to be so humble."
45.08,46.08," Yeah, I was one of the guys."
46.08,47.68," But really it's really a team thing, right?"
47.68,49.120000000000005, I can't pick all the credit.
49.120000000000005,50.120000000000005, Just most of it.
50.120000000000005,52.96, Three percent.
52.96,54.96," And so company heroes won and two, right?"
54.96,57.2," Well, opposing friends."
57.2,58.2, Two.
58.2,59.2, Right.
59.2,60.2, Okay.
60.2,61.2, That doesn't count about.
61.2,63.4," Yeah, that's how much I played your game."
63.4,67.88, And a whole world too before that.
67.88,69.24000000000001, But not the dawn of war series.
69.24000000000001,71.08, I asked before a week podcast.
71.08,73.44, Is it to be good to mention Chris's games?
73.44,76.6," No, we're just going to talk with Josh and we're going to make Chris feel shitty though."
76.6,77.6, Great.
77.6,79.0, Commander as the expansion's about feelings.
79.0,83.04, Fourth coming space siege as well as some oversight over Demi gone.
83.04,84.04, Right.
84.04,85.04, And then we'll go on our last cover.
85.04,86.04, That's right.
86.04,87.64, So see we have some love for you.
87.64,88.64, Yeah.
88.64,89.64, Appreciate that.
89.64,90.64, That was a great cover.
90.64,91.64, Thank you.
91.64,93.28," Really, really love that cover."
93.28,94.64, So I'm glad you did.
94.64,97.92, Actually my first question for you was about that.
97.92,102.44000000000001," It was just, you know, when we first started talking about that game, it actually didn't"
102.44000000000001,108.56," come out right away that you weren't the, you know, that you were working with an outside"
108.56,109.56, development team on that.
109.56,115.04, And I'm just wondering for you what the experience of that is for you personally being
115.04,119.16, in that sort of position as opposed to like the lead guy in charge on the project.
119.16,123.32000000000001," How it, well, it's an internal, it's an internal team."
123.32000000000001,127.96000000000001, I'm just in a role where I sit down with the guys and I talk about the design with them.
127.96000000000001,131.08, But I'm not the lead visionary designer.
131.08,134.56, Like typically I come up with a game and I lead it.
134.56,137.72, And I'm the creative force behind it.
137.72,143.52," Well, this was John Colms and he worked with his guys, the producer Bob Barry and Nate"
143.52,146.28," Simpson, the lead designer of the lead artist."
146.28,150.48, And they really formed the creative vision of the game.
150.48,155.84, And I'm the guy who supports it and into some degree shields the world from it.
155.84,159.24, There's a certain amount of shielding that goes on.
159.24,165.8," In this case, it's not as hard because, you know, when I run the company, you know,"
165.88000000000002,168.56, I have an easier time of it.
168.56,174.28," But if I go back 10 years to Cave Dog where Ron Gilbert, for example, was doing that role"
174.28,182.52," with me on total annihilation, he was shielding me from GT who bought humongous, who, in"
182.52,187.88000000000002," a situation like that, where a company buys a developer, and actually they were a publisher"
187.88000000000002,188.88000000000002, developer.
188.88000000000002,192.0," It'd be easy for them to come in and say, hey, what's this game?"
192.0,193.0, Total annihilation.
193.0,194.0, We're going to get our fingers in there.
194.08,196.08, We're going to rip it apart.
196.08,196.92, We're going to change it.
196.92,197.88, We're going to do all this stuff.
197.88,198.88, So he did a lot.
199.16,201.36, He really had to work harder to shield.
201.36,204.4," I don't have to work as hard, but I'm in that position."
205.12,208.6, So that's kind of what my role is and so forth.
208.6,211.48, So are you allowed to contribute design ideas?
211.48,212.72, Or do you want to or do there?
212.72,215.76," She's like, yeah, yeah Chris, that's great."
216.32,217.52, We'll get the hell out of here.
217.52,218.36, So we can work.
218.36,218.96, That'd be great.
219.08,222.12," If I have any ideas, I'll throw them out there."
222.20000000000002,225.96," I'm happy too, and I'm sure the guys would feel those ideas."
225.96,232.36," And but I've got a lot going on as well, creatively in the company."
232.36,237.20000000000002, So I'm not really a monkey on their back creatively.
237.20000000000002,242.4, So they're really quite free to just focus on that.
242.4,244.64000000000001," Well, I'm busy doing the other stuff."
244.64000000000001,249.12, Josh is relicking a position where you need shielding from THQ presumably.
249.52,252.20000000000002," You know, actually a relationship with THQ is actually really awesome."
252.20000000000002,253.52, They sort of let us do our thing.
253.52,256.8," You know, it's actually is more of the other where Rome keeps kind of going to them"
256.8,259.72," and trying to ask them, especially from the marketing side."
259.72,263.92," You know, so what do you guys, you know, how can we help you guys sell our games?"
263.92,264.72, Like things.
264.72,266.04, So generally they're pretty hand off.
266.04,266.56, Okay.
266.56,269.12, So that's like how we are with Microsoft.
269.76,270.76, Actually it is.
270.76,271.52, It kind of is.
271.52,272.16, They don't.
272.16,272.76, Yeah.
272.76,275.52, Most of the time we forget that there's a right.
275.52,277.52," Shouldn't be saying that I'm there, but most of the time."
277.52,280.71999999999997," I mean, that's a good thing though for from an editorial side of the last thing we'd"
280.71999999999997,284.12," want is any sort of dabbling on, you know, right."
284.12,287.88," Yeah, now people always ask us, you know, like, so how much is Microsoft and offering"
287.88,291.47999999999996," your magazine where like, well, you don't think they remember they have a magazine."
291.47999999999996,292.71999999999997, Which is awesome.
292.71999999999997,298.03999999999996," You guys clearly, you know, all your experiences, not all of it, but experiences in our"
298.03999999999996,299.03999999999996, T.S. is.
299.03999999999996,302.15999999999997," And the question, I know it's been a concern for you."
302.15999999999997,304.44, And I'm assuming it's a concern for you as well.
304.44,308.0, I want to say you are something to Josh and some sort of listeners can't see my finger.
308.0,310.76," Now, I'm including Chris."
310.76,315.92, This is that our T.S. is in danger of falling into a place where fighting games got where
315.92,319.88," at first they were, you know, Street Fighter came out, Street Fighter II, ton of people played"
319.88,320.88, it.
320.88,325.88," And then they continued to cater to the most die hard segment of their other fan base,"
325.88,329.52," becoming, you know, increasingly complex, but giving more, the more that, you know, it was"
329.52,332.8, great for those of us that were that into it because the more that we had invested in
332.8,334.44," the game, the more we take from it."
334.44,340.28000000000003," But I was just wondering if, if you guys worry about, you know, RTS is a genre, if it's"
340.28000000000003,343.84000000000003," potentially, you know, shrinking it's potential audience."
343.84000000000003,345.16," Yeah, I think so."
345.16,350.32," I think for me, one of the warning signs was when they lumped us with the AIS awards"
350.32,354.84000000000003," with simulation, which at one point in the 80s was one of the big genres right, but now"
354.84000000000003,357.44," it's sort of like, you know, you can hear the crickets."
357.44,361.92," So when it's like you're, you've got your calculator wristwatch on there."
361.92,366.0," And when they lumped strategy games, the simulation games together, that's kind of like,"
366.0,369.40000000000003," you know, it's no longer a strong enough category to be by itself."
369.40000000000003,370.40000000000003, Right.
370.40000000000003,373.96000000000004," So I do think that there is a huge concern with, you know, the over-compliment, you know,"
373.96000000000004,376.16, we make our games a little too complex.
376.16,377.16, Right.
377.16,382.32," And I think it's really easy for us to, to forget there's a difference between depth"
382.32,383.32, and complexity.
383.32,385.36," And a lot of the times, I think we go for complexity."
385.36,388.6, And that's necessarily what we really want from our games.
388.6,389.6, So.
390.52000000000004,391.36," Yeah, I tend to agree."
391.36,399.6," I think there's a component of complexity, but also piracy that contributes heavily"
399.6,400.0, to it.
402.0,404.6, We're seeing across over and out of the console.
404.6,406.6, So we'll see how we do there.
406.6,411.92, We could really come back strong now that we're on multiple platforms.
411.92,416.96000000000004, And we'll see it's going to be interesting to see how the console community votes
416.96,420.32, with their dollars now on that platform.
420.32,427.76," And if they, if they welcome the genre there, it'll be, it'll strengthen it."
427.76,429.79999999999995, And we can go deeper and more complex.
429.79999999999995,430.79999999999995, Or we can back off there.
430.79999999999995,434.08," But in general, I tend to agree."
434.08,441.84, We still need to dial back the complexity knob across the board out of principle.
441.84,443.71999999999997, We need to be able to jump in.
443.72,447.96000000000004, I think tutorials in general just don't belong in video games.
447.96000000000004,451.24," I mean, I don't think tutorials belong in entertainment."
451.24,453.72, I don't want to read a tutorial.
453.72,459.0," If I'm running a VCR hell, if I had to read a tutorial to run my microwave oven,"
459.0,463.96000000000004, I'd probably have a fit.
463.96000000000004,467.8," You know, let alone any other entertainment device or any other device in my house."
467.8,472.6, So why do I want to run a tutorial on a video game?
472.68,474.20000000000005, When you're about to have fun with it.
474.20000000000005,474.68, Yeah.
474.68,478.44," Do you think like, are you thinking along the lines of rather than like an all or nothing?"
478.44,482.6, Our games need to become uniformly less complex where you have that element of complexity
482.6,483.24, still there.
483.24,487.48, But then you also have like some other access point that's not a tutorial that can get people in.
487.48,492.28000000000003," Because my big thing was I was an RTS player long long ago, stepped away for it forever."
492.28000000000003,495.40000000000003, And then when I wanted to come back on frequently see something.
495.40000000000003,496.52000000000004, This looks really interesting.
496.52000000000004,497.64000000000004, I think I could like this.
497.64000000000004,501.48," But then you open the box and the first thing, even before I get to the tutorial,"
501.48,506.20000000000005," I'm looking through the manual and I'm like, good god, this is work."
506.20000000000005,508.84000000000003," And I'm like, I want to have fun right now."
508.84000000000003,514.44, But then it's like when I do finally get down and when I finally got back down and it was with
514.44,519.32," company heroes and played and played, you finally hit the moment where you're no longer"
519.32,522.6," worrying about the system, you're no longer thinking about the things and you're just engaging"
522.6,523.64, the system and having fun.
523.64,527.8000000000001," And then it's incredible and you get in my experience, you get a lot more out of it than you do"
527.8000000000001,530.6800000000001, from all these other genres that are immediately accessible.
530.76,533.4, So it's like I hate to lose the one and the expense of the other.
533.4,537.4," But then whenever I try to turn someone else on, let's go play Spring Commander,"
537.4,540.76," Company Heroes, it's like, where do I start?"
540.76,541.7199999999999, Should I play the campaign?
541.7199999999999,543.0, Will that teach me multiplayer?
543.0,543.7199999999999, Will it not?
543.7199999999999,545.56," I mean, they're a huge barrier to entry."
545.56,548.76, And I think one of the things that's important is we're not necessarily saying that we need to
548.76,550.3599999999999," dumb the RTS down, right?"
550.3599999999999,554.68," But just really, we think some of the assumptions, we need to rethink some of the conventions"
554.68,557.16, that we hold to the early ones and we can't change that.
557.24,562.52," And really start asking ourselves, how can we do a better job of taking players into the"
562.52,567.4," experience, let them do all that learning so they can start seeing all the nuances and all the"
567.4,569.64, all the juice that makes it a strategy game really awesome.
569.64,571.88, But in a way that it doesn't totally intimidate them.
571.88,575.3199999999999," And one of the examples we can be using at Relic is, wow, right?"
575.3199999999999,579.8," Now, one of the cool things about, wow, is if you look at the screen or somebody who's level five"
579.8,585.16," and then you look at their screen with a level 60, the comparison is very little, you are a very simple"
585.24,589.48," but level 60, there's all this crazy complexity, like it almost looks like you're staring at a"
589.48,595.8," sort of Vegas casino. But what's the timeframe there? Right? We're talking days, months, weeks and"
595.8,600.6," stuff like that. Whereas in an RTS, you go from zero complexity to maximum complexity in 20 minutes."
600.6,603.48, Right. And that's one of the big barriers that we have to bring.
603.48,610.8399999999999," I always think about, along with, wow, Blizzard did a great job with their strategy games in"
610.9200000000001,615.32," terms of, you know, instead of tutorials and certainly they're not the only company that did that with"
615.32,621.88, their RTS as of kind of building an invisible tutorial into the first few levels of the single player
621.88,628.6800000000001," campaign. You know, the first scenario or two of Warcraft 2 was like, you know, build four farms."
628.6800000000001,633.48, So it's basically just like teaching you the mechanics and then ramping it up sort of invisibly.
633.48,638.76," So by the time you're at like the fifth level of the single player campaign, you're now engaging"
638.84,642.84, the system as Sean was talking about. Right. And that's both both of your games as well. Your
642.84,646.84," campaigns do. Right. I mean, so don't you feel like, I mean, Chrissy said you don't want to ever see"
646.84,651.16, a tutorial in your game again. And I think I probably agree with you. But but certainly you've
651.16,656.84," done that, too, in terms of making it just be part of the experience of work of getting the player"
656.84,663.16," up to speed just in the course of the game. Yeah, we do. We integrated into the early campaign."
664.04,670.76, We add the tutorial anyway for for people who want to just go through it. It's there for comfort.
670.76,675.9599999999999," But unfortunately, there is a lot of complexity to the game that just kind of needs"
677.0,684.76, tutorial advance command systems and stuff like that. And it's kind of like we create a game
684.76,692.04, that is so deep that it it would it's not about it's not about what the game actually is.
692.12,695.56, It's about what the game looks like in a box on the shelf from from 10 feet away
696.1999999999999,702.12," that you would bounce off of if you're in the store going, it's a nice Saturday. I think I will buy"
702.12,707.7199999999999," a pleasant game to take home and curl up with, you know, it's like, no, that's not it. That"
707.7199999999999,714.76," looks like it'll hurt my brain kind of complexity like chess versus, you know, peggle. Sure."
714.76,723.88," Yeah, who said that? Yeah. You know, that's that competitive brain melting feeling versus the"
723.88,733.88, relaxation sort of entertaining. I mean TV movies listening to a music CD. That's pure entertainment
733.88,740.36, and video games historically haven't really embraced pure entertainment. They've embraced. It's
740.44,747.96, like it's like just the hard puzzles in a crossword puzzle book. And I've firmly believed
747.96,753.08," that we've got to and I'm getting away from just our TS discussion here, but our our our whole"
753.08,757.96," industry has has already made several steps towards it, but we've yet to fully really"
758.6800000000001,764.84," march over into the land of just hey, I got a video game and I played it all weekend and I didn't"
764.84,770.2, really try to get a high score and I didn't really try to test my reflexes and I didn't try to
770.84,777.88, test my memory retention and my problem solving skills. I just played this video game all week
777.88,783.72," and long gone. I had fun with it and and somebody says really and yeah, I didn't do any of those"
783.72,788.84, other. I didn't do any of those those things that I talked about. That's going to be an important step
788.84,794.9200000000001," forward for our our our our craft. It does I mean well, PC those games are certainly, you know,"
794.9200000000001,799.08, notwithstanding Sims and World of Warcraft. Those are the games that are selling right now. I mean
799.8000000000001,806.12," the casual games, you know, the pop cap games like Peggle that came up. There's still still skill"
806.12,813.48, in them though and there's and I'm a table is it's very very close because because just chaos is such
813.48,818.9200000000001," a huge you know, component in that game that it is very close to where I think you have to"
818.9200000000001,822.76," if you're going to defend the game, you're going to have to do the bulk of your work explaining"
822.76,829.64, why it's anything other than like a slot machine and we've all done that right we've all done
829.64,834.28," that in our show, but I think when most people play it's fun because pretty colors come up and"
834.28,839.24," I feel like I did something and I get points. But again it's like you get points, but you can't"
839.24,843.08," do anything but get points, you know, so it's not quite it's just I worked on the points all"
843.08,850.84, link on you know prices right. You you mentioned piracy and as you know as a limiting factor
851.1600000000001,856.6800000000001, and I just want to say like how how extensive of an issue do you think that is for for PC gaming
856.6800000000001,862.2800000000001, you know well I look at metrics like I look at Nvidia how many video cards they're selling
862.9200000000001,869.32, how successful that company is and I know how how most of the success of that company comes from
869.32,877.0, the high-end video cards and the dual SLI treatments that hardcore gamers are installing and I know
877.08,881.88, that they typically go up and buy the you know they're the kinds of players that buy the high-end
881.88,887.32, games and the difficult games they're very smart players and when you look at the sales of games
887.32,893.0, like prices and Call of Duty 4 and compare those to the sales of like take Call of Duty 4 out
893.72,902.76, compared to the Xbox 360 sales there's an incredible difference in the sales and you know that
903.72,910.76, there's probably way more people in the world that have rigs that will run the game on the PC
910.76,917.16, so there's something something's broken and it's kind of all back of an app can theory but
917.88,924.68, somebody somewhere is buying really high-end video cards and they're not buying games to go and play
924.76,931.4, on them and so there's it's like there's there's something going on there
931.4,936.5999999999999, what about you Josh I mean you have any any more direct evidence for like say company heroes
936.5999999999999,940.92, nothing you like you catch people I mean are you able to see our people with crack versions able to
940.92,945.4799999999999, even play online well they're able to circumvent all our stuff we try to put up there to try to
945.4799999999999,950.28, prevent and you know some of again there's nothing direct and stress is all behind the napkin type
950.28,954.6, stuff but if you just compare the number of you know downloads of our patches compared to the
954.6,959.64, number of copies that are sold and everybody like everybody must be downloading like five copies of
959.64,965.9599999999999, those patches for whatever reason to but those numbers are totally skewed on that magnitude to five times
965.9599999999999,971.3199999999999, well I wouldn't say the the the the magnuses it's it's it's it's high when it's a five times
971.3199999999999,975.88, or might have been exaggerating but it's it's noticeable right and it's you know it hurts
976.4399999999999,980.76, and so with this affecting your studios you know when you when you look at the future
980.76,985.16, and the platforms that you're going to develop on has a absolutely good factors heavily in
985.16,991.0, that's absolutely impressive to you feels kind of as down on the PC right now as Chris kind of
991.0,996.04, sounds just in terms of that you know what we have a lot of challenges right on the PC market I
996.04,1000.28, think I mean part of it is I mean piracy I think is a really big one and I think the whole
1000.28,1004.44, sort of comparing how many people buying video cards and people buying games is a really good
1004.5200000000001,1011.96, analogy but even our system requirements are insane really like forcing people to spend anywhere
1011.96,1015.72, from a thousand to three thousand dollars for the privilege of playing your game the way it's meant to
1015.72,1020.12, be played we're limiting our potential markets we're limiting how many people we can get
1020.6800000000001,1025.16, you know to jump on board and try these really awesome games on so okay so I I wonder about that
1025.16,1031.24, because you know when you're working on the on the design docs I mean you know look this is a
1031.32,1035.4, classic example that gets brought up all the time right now and I'm sorry for bringing it up again
1035.4,1042.84, but you know but look at wow I mean they've been able to sustain not just interest but incredible
1042.84,1049.0, growth in their game over four years now with the system spec that's like amazingly low so why
1049.0,1058.1200000000001, couldn't guys at relic making a game like company furrows sort of look at their design spec and see
1058.1999999999998,1064.36, where it's going and scale it back and maybe compromise here there to to make that game that would be
1064.36,1068.36, comparable to wow in terms of requirements you know it's still at the same game play I think to be honest
1068.36,1072.9199999999998, there's sort of a lot of drinking the cool life happening is you know growing up in a sort of PC
1072.9199999999998,1078.52, studio is sort of like you sort of you get sort of like totally like enamored with the whole sort of pushing
1078.52,1083.7199999999998, technology and really driving things things forward and you don't know which realising immediately
1083.72,1089.8, with the cost of sort of pushing those decisions forward right and I also think that a lot of PC games have
1089.8,1094.28, really awesome technical art direction and then this is really really awesome art direction and again
1094.28,1098.04, wow is really good example that it's the main spec they really matter because the game looked awesome
1098.04,1102.04, right and look awesome because of the art style TF2's another one I would say you know
1102.92,1106.92, I mean but so that's what I wonder sometimes when I'm hearing developers talk about
1107.48,1111.16, it's just it's just superhibitive and nobody's you know that then we got a force people to buy these
1111.24,1115.64, video cards that makes me feel like well this is kind of your guys fault oh for sure I think you know
1115.64,1119.4, we're we're really responsible for a lot of this stuff because we're the ones making it right we're
1119.96,1125.72, we're really guys pushing the crack out right yeah so yes it's hard to be recognized with a new game
1125.72,1135.24, when it doesn't look really sexy and sexy is high in graphics it's really cool shaders it's uh
1135.32,1142.84, how you get recognized so there's a little bit of uh you know we're we're creating this problem but we're
1143.8,1148.1200000000001, you know we're kind of prisoners of it too or yeah you know what I'm getting at yeah it's hard
1148.1200000000001,1153.08, to articulate it and so yeah if we want to if we want to say okay let's create something with a
1153.08,1158.52, really really cool art style and let's bet on the fact that people are gonna recognize really
1158.52,1164.84, cool art style that's a really that's a really risky bet to make that they're gonna appreciate
1164.84,1171.32, deep gameplay but with uh what could could with it with one slip up look like dated graphics
1172.1999999999998,1179.48, but it's gonna run on 50 million computers that are $800 computers you know woo and uh oh but you know
1179.48,1184.76, to the to the to the world of workcraft point that's a secure environment there's no piracy and
1184.76,1189.8799999999999, those guys I mean they have something magical they have the the world's greatest brand on the PC it's
1189.96,1197.4, unmatched um and uh you just you don't have that out of the gate uh so you don't you don't
1197.4,1204.6000000000001, build a business plan and say oh yeah we can reproduce that I mean how many MMOs have tried and
1204.6000000000001,1209.72, failed and how many more will try and fail I don't even want to know I don't want to see the pile of
1209.72,1214.92, money that is gonna be burned up yep that scares the hell out of me yep all right yeah we get those
1214.92,1221.48, demos every week or so it scares me and it's not even my money it seems like there's a couple
1221.48,1225.4, paths too I mean we'll far more in a couple I mean there's the let's okay let's go to the consoles
1225.4,1230.28, and see how that works where we have a certain guarantee and then there's like you know dice recently
1230.28,1234.04, and out it's about a field heroes game and that's got a strategy I'm curious to see what you guys
1234.04,1239.8000000000002, make of that if that seems viable and also tied up into that is to knowing that you want to make a
1239.8000000000002,1243.72, game I mean because that's a double edge thing with that right it's like well it's free so you can't
1243.8,1248.04, rip it off you know but also you're gonna keep cling back you can see the advertisement but for you
1248.04,1252.6000000000001, guys like you know because you're talking about how wow is secure in that way to get our T.S. is where
1252.6000000000001,1257.64, they are actually secure in a comparable fashion based on the way that you design it with you know
1257.64,1261.88, leveling up or whatever the case may be designing communities into it so that it's really
1262.6000000000001,1267.48, or even making it so that it's like if you ban someone from using it that's gonna basically kill the
1267.48,1274.04, game for them you know so I mean the original question is I mean is it just a case of well here's
1274.04,1278.6, our answer we're gonna go to console or are you very seriously looking at these alternatives and
1278.6,1282.6, and even other ones that I haven't mentioned so what I mean we're really sure so about exploring
1282.6,1289.0, them so the gamut right I think console is only like sort of in-term solution you know I mean none
1289.0,1292.6, of those sort of console strategy games are really sold really well yet right because again
1292.6,1296.28, there's still sort of adhering to the old paradigm of what an art yes is and trying to sort of find
1296.28,1300.76, a way to copy and paste that onto the console right when somebody starts figuring out a way of
1300.76,1305.24, how to inject some of the sort of RTS magic in a way that works on a console that might change
1305.24,1309.72, just like what you be soft as attempting with end war maybe Microsoft with you know Halo
1309.72,1313.6399999999999, Halo Wars yeah but definitely we're exploring sort of different avenues like you mentioned
1313.6399999999999,1318.84, battle field heroes right now we're working with Shanda in China to do company heroes online which
1318.84,1323.08, is essentially used this is the same model that battle field heroes is working on and I mean initially
1323.1599999999999,1326.6799999999998, we're just releasing that in China but you know essentially I've planned that if it works there
1326.6799999999998,1330.76, we're gonna start propagating it across so but really we're trying to attack this on many different
1330.76,1334.9199999999998, fronts right so we're tracking attacking it from a sort of gameplay and a design perspective
1334.9199999999998,1339.48, by trying to find ways to ease players into the experience without overloading with complexity
1339.48,1348.36, or exploring different platforms and sort of different delivery methods as well Chris what was the
1349.32,1354.76, so you're moving you're taking your ball and going over to the console court oh yeah yeah
1354.76,1360.36, you're already remember yeah I was going to randomly make my name a court and it's not that
1360.36,1367.7199999999998, attractive anymore now that 41 so that's not saying much um the yeah the the console the copy
1367.7199999999998,1374.9199999999998, paste point is interesting we're really happy a little plug here shamelessly about subcom 360 we're
1374.92,1380.28, really happy with how that turned out and the big thing was the strategic zoom being able to pull
1380.28,1386.6000000000001, out the camera and push it in if you have a big map and you're trying to slide that that map around
1386.6000000000001,1393.8000000000002, with the with the with the controls with it with a console controller that's really cumbersome no matter
1393.8000000000002,1401.0800000000002, how you dress it up but by pulling out and pushing in it's super buttery and some of you guys may have
1401.24,1408.84, actually seen it in passing of through uh I don't know uh it's um it's great so when people
1408.84,1415.08, get their hands on it it's going to do a lot for RTS games on the consoles and uh there's there's
1415.08,1419.48, probably a whole bunch of fine tuning and refinements that are going to be made from here on in but it's
1419.48,1426.76, it's just just that it's fine tuning how are you handling a unit selection we do we do double click
1426.92,1432.12, to select groups we do we have grew a lot of ton of group selection stuff our stuff is only one
1432.12,1437.8, layer deep though so we don't do a whole lot of complex select this do this bring up this menu and
1437.8,1444.04, select that we do very very simple stuff and you can get access to almost every single
1444.04,1450.84, command system on the original PC game with the console controller so it's just really great you can
1450.9199999999998,1456.6, ferry units around with the with the with with transports and just do all of that stuff laid out
1457.56,1462.52, waypoint systems and adjust waypoint you can do all that stuff so it's really cool and because it's a
1462.52,1468.28, strategy game that allows you to pull out and operate at a strategic level you don't find yourself
1468.28,1473.48, in a click fest like a starcraft type game or a workcraft type you actually operate in this big
1473.48,1478.84, theater of war so it works beautifully because it isn't a contest of clicks so we're really excited
1478.84,1486.6, I can't wait to to see how how that works and because it's it's a multi threaded application
1486.6,1493.08, when went over to the 360 it ported over very very well to the multi to the multi processors 360 runs
1493.08,1501.9599999999998, really smoothly handles all that action it's it's worked out really well so I'm really quite excited
1501.9599999999998,1507.9599999999998, I don't know that we're going to have to hit it like a dumbet down in the future or do anything
1508.04,1515.0, radical to it it might actually just continue to just go through refinement to to exist there
1516.1200000000001,1521.56, so I'm optimistic so is this certain dip it is that it worked out so well for on the console
1521.56,1525.8, or like going back years ago and you started conceptualizing subcom was it in the back of your mind
1525.8,1529.96, that like you know maybe this thing's going to go to a console someday so let's build in some
1529.96,1536.2, groundwork for that I'm not going to try to try to convince you that I was luck the strategic
1536.28,1542.04, zoom was just was just pure design that's what I wanted to do on the PC and then the light came on
1542.3600000000001,1548.44, when you have HD and you when you look at the power of the 360 when you when it emerged and I was like
1548.44,1554.1200000000001, you know the strategic zoom would work really great on the 360 and it turned out to be just that
1554.1200000000001,1562.44, and and people who play it when I walk through a QA room and there's you know 20 people all testing
1562.52,1567.56, sup come 360 and you stand back and you watch 20 computers and they're all zooming in and out
1567.56,1572.68, like all at different times oops oops oops and you're like going yep look at them it's not like
1572.68,1577.48, I'm telling them hey you should zoom in and out it'll work better for you they're all just doing
1577.48,1582.8400000000001, it on their own and you put someone in front of the game five minutes they're zooming and you
1582.8400000000001,1588.76, realize that it's natural it's what you do on Google Maps it's what you do in an art program
1588.84,1593.4, when you're modeling it's what you do in any application where you want to get the big picture
1593.4,1597.72, and then you want to go in and fiddle and you come out get the big picture zoom in and fiddle
1597.72,1602.36, and you're zooming under the cursor you're never zooming to the center of the screen you're always
1602.36,1608.84, zooming under the cursor it's super intuitive and it's mind boggling that it took till 2000 in
1609.3999999999999,1616.9199999999998, friggin you know eight for this to come to the surface you know we should have been here 10 years ago
1618.4399999999998,1625.08, do you wonder it all because I do in terms of the
1626.6,1632.1999999999998, viability of not the viability of so that's right word but here's what I wonder I'll start again
1633.16,1639.64, the art he has genre on the console to me is is a leap that that I wonder if everybody can
1639.64,1645.24, really make just in terms of the kind of game it is and the kind of gaming it is because it is
1645.24,1651.64, to some extent you know a fairly wonky exercise no matter how much you know you make a pretty
1651.64,1658.1200000000001, or make the interface work or the controls work you're still dealing with you know managing units
1658.12,1666.12, and it's an intense mental experience which to me is often counter to what you're doing on a
1666.12,1670.6799999999998, console which is sitting back on your couch I'm not saying that there's not complex games on
1670.6799999999998,1676.4399999999998, the console at all I just mean that this particular type of game genre to me feels more like
1676.4399999999998,1685.4799999999998, not but I mean like just even in terms of like the way you might sit when you're playing a game
1685.48,1690.28, like this like I feel much more comfortable when I'm playing a game like this basically being like
1690.28,1693.96, three inches from my screen which is just because I'm pretty don't do supreme commanding with
1693.96,1700.04, your feet up on the coffee table and send or or company here as we are sending actual you know
1700.04,1706.1200000000001, humans to their death go here it's more of a moderate commanding kind of such a
1708.92,1714.1200000000001, do you get what I'm saying maybe I'm not making it clear I just think that I wonder if that's
1714.12,1720.84, a barrier to console players playing our tests is at all well it's you know first person
1720.84,1726.28, shooters on the console can get pretty intense too but I do agree I like being in a relaxed
1726.28,1733.2399999999998," posture when I play console games really you know lean back, feed up sort you know drunk whatever"
1733.2399999999998,1742.12, and I'm kidding I don't drink I don't touch this stuff really but we got at a little sort of adult
1742.12,1747.32, content right I get beside it for the whole show there oh no well we'll take it anyway you
1747.32,1755.3999999999999, want to go all abuse no animals were harmed during the show but the the the point is though
1755.3999999999999,1759.8799999999999, I mean there's still a lot of games on the console though that'll have you in a sweat you know
1759.8799999999999,1764.12, so right I'm not saying that their camping and tents experience I mean just like with an RTS
1764.12,1769.4799999999998, you're talking about small units on a screen that you're manipulating around a map you want to
1769.48,1773.72, be to direct this when you're playing exactly the same type of experience you're going to get on a
1773.72,1780.1200000000001, television and you're couch what well that's what we always call like we used to do really drive and
1780.1200000000001,1784.04, you know the the guy in your passenger seats got to see it all up and just like reach over and
1784.04,1790.1200000000001, grab the things a kickback almost wrecked his stuff so he's like oh that's cool but that's what we
1790.1200000000001,1794.04, called like the the PC game posture and you're sitting there especially in the days of the boom
1794.04,1797.88, mic you're up on your table guys you're coming into our back base get back your HQ you know
1797.88,1802.7600000000002, that kind of thing isn't that what you're doing every night with I do it every day here else yeah
1803.5600000000002,1806.2800000000002, it's up I got a I don't have a boom mic now I got a mic in my head to it
1807.8000000000002,1812.44, I'm not saying that you guys need to get to that posture for PC gaming yeah they're looking at you
1812.44,1816.2800000000002, a little blank yeah you guys well we just don't want to take the softball pitch on home or
1816.2800000000002,1822.92, rectus yeah we don't want to touch we don't want to touch that I mean this is a family show
1822.92,1830.04, not really no I mean don't think that's like a vegan a bea some butt head
1832.04,1836.04, well I'm aware of the every death part of the part of why the origin of the term but
1837.24,1844.44, it's a bright man sure it's sure it's not just go with that let's go with that
1844.44,1848.8400000000001, I want to know who comes up with these terms I want to meet the guy who said you know we need a term
1848.84,1856.76, here how about homeorectus and yeah that sounds great Bob sounds like a good job let's go to lunch
1858.04,1863.9599999999998, yeah that's a job well days all in a day yeah okay
1866.36,1872.76, you guys you guys are a question in there yeah you guys it's a turn it series to turn it from homeorectus
1872.76,1878.28, to total seriousness again you feel you're able to that your studios you're developing
1878.36,1882.2, precisely the games you want to be developing right now and you're getting the funding from publishers
1882.2,1887.56, or is it always a matter of compromise is just normal course of things that you have to
1887.56,1891.24, compromise and say well we need to do this and this is going to be on the back burner until we can
1891.24,1896.92, eventually prevail in one of these you know dog and pony shows and get someone to sign up and
1896.92,1902.52, and write the check for this well I think I mean at least for us I'd really really like you
1902.52,1907.4, around THQ is basically this we're making the thing kind of games that we want to make and we're
1907.4,1912.52, making the games at THQ wants us to make so where where's my next company here is expansion oh
1912.52,1918.36, oh it's it's coming okay it is well you know it's you know it's it's it coming well it just
1918.36,1921.48, we love the franchise right right again and I keep saying it and this one of those
1921.48,1925.8, of course we win the answers but we have plans for it okay no you don't just give birth to
1925.8,1929.8799999999999, something like that and just drop it right so I know I don't really conflate what I love with
1929.88,1935.0800000000002, why your studio really wants to be doing but I think the game was a labor love so it was
1935.0800000000002,1941.88, assuming it was an epic yeah actually we have guys working on it like Quinn Duffy's our senior
1941.88,1946.3600000000001, designer has not been working on company heroes longer than we'll work to last it
1947.4,1953.48, comes up that works for me wow real war short yeah entertainment experiences long yeah
1954.44,1960.68, yeah but you Chris well we you know we sort of split it if you look at my career most
1960.68,1966.44, most everything I've done has been original um and you know some of the stuff's you know done
1966.44,1970.92, well some of it's the sort of medium but it's all original and I'm proud of the fact that I don't
1970.92,1976.84, just chase after dollars you know I'm not in the little the glass dollar cage and I'm and
1976.84,1981.16, you know it's I mean I mean the art cage more I'm sort of I'm sort of going hey I want to
1981.16,1987.64, I want to expand the I want to expand the the the the art and craft of game making
1988.68,1993.96, and that's a tough that's a tough deal because you got to keep paying the payroll and you
1993.96,1999.5600000000002, got to keep the the lights on and the business and and the industry's getting more you know more
1999.5600000000002,2005.24, corporate and you know it's getting it's getting more complex so we got to pay attention to the way
2005.8,2012.28, the the market's going and we got to listen to our customers and we got to innovate because you can't
2012.28,2017.16, just always look to the market because that tends to be a reflection of what has already happened
2018.76,2025.64, so it's a complex process but we still find that the stuff we're doing moving forward is
2025.64,2032.84, some of the most original games we've ever we've ever made so the stuff will announce at E3
2033.6399999999999,2039.8, the stuff will announce at E3 next year if we do announce at E3 or could be a GDC or could just go
2039.8,2045.08, out like Demi God did this this January so you've got announcements then I mean obviously you
2045.08,2053.64, know yeah spacey gin oh yeah oh yeah we got we've got two more games at least to talk about
2053.64,2062.52, and maybe another one after that so lots of stuff in the pipe and uh two of those very
2062.52,2071.08, very original very wacky crazy stuff that you will look at and go my goodness that's that's wild
2071.08,2079.7999999999997, Chris that's very homo erectus the P.C. too the no effort for homo and the homo erectus game as we
2079.8,2086.52, call it that's it is it's a game of what a working title it's a game of what a guy who wakes up one
2086.52,2093.32, morning and says I don't want to go to work today I'm gonna just stay in bed now it's uh it's a I was
2093.32,2104.6000000000004, into it yeah like this he just he just drinks pop just like cover but uh these these titles are
2104.6,2111.72, it's some are console some are console and P.C. so real mix and cover in a spectrum because
2111.72,2118.2, really moving forward it's about it's about making creating IP and getting kind of a full spectrum
2118.2,2122.8399999999997, across multiple platforms and when you build content now and I don't want to sound all weird but this
2122.8399999999997,2128.8399999999997, business tends to kind of pound your flat in terms of getting all this lingo but when we create content
2128.92,2136.2000000000003, we create all this all this rich expensive content we really have to get it into as many people's hands
2136.2000000000003,2143.4, as we can and that really means going out onto as many uh many platforms as possible so
2144.76,2149.4, that's what we're doing all right I think do we have to get mr. Taylor out of here oh
2150.2000000000003,2155.0, oh we got five more minutes about that I'm not giving you the kind of I got a good question I see
2155.0,2161.72, quiet if until now okay so I'm just totally serious quiet and it's not for you what so
2161.72,2165.64, would you you gotta be honest what do you what do you think of the dungeon see to movey
2167.48,2173.8, we you know we are in for a whole theater out and uh we took the whole company down there and man
2173.8,2181.24, we had the time of our lives we had a blast but you don't drink we we were not drinking we did not
2181.24,2185.8799999999997, get drunk in the theater um but we had a we had a riot no we did not drop out of it
2188.2799999999997,2193.4799999999996, all great ideas mini film which they're giving out at the convention you said it for that
2193.4799999999996,2199.0, oh no we had a lot of fun I tell everyone I try to I try to be as honest as I can that I'm not a
2199.0,2204.7599999999998, movie critic so I'm not really a guy who who hands out a critical reviews of the movie
2205.0800000000004,2213.96, everybody's in the creative okay well I I thought that you know it's definitely um one of the best
2214.76,2221.96, films that uh Uv is done and that's uh that's really key that's a real key data point so
2223.1600000000003,2228.5200000000004, we had a lot of fun with what if you didn't you had no association with the property on it
2228.5200000000004,2234.44, and a friend was asking you hey should I go pay 1050 tonight and see this if you were a Bert Reynolds fan
2234.52,2243.0, absolutely it's the reason there's nothing like we and Ray Leota at Bert Reynolds and John Rye's Davies
2243.0,2248.52, all together on the silver's been real actors all starca yeah it really is it's just it's just it's just
2248.52,2255.7200000000003, good fun and you know if you if you needed your Lord of the Rings fix for 2008 and nothing's coming
2255.7200000000003,2262.92, down the pipe uh there it is for you there you go there you go don't just a dragon's a movie
2263.0,2268.28, either of you yeah no I did actually what that now that's what you said no no don't don't don't
2268.28,2273.08, don't you see the the the the name of the king blows that out of the water I got to tell you the truth
2274.76,2279.96, the the don't you see the pardon me the uh don't you just a dragon's movie was a smoke and pile
2279.96,2285.8, okay and I'm not a critic I don't I don't judge but that was a terrible movie so uh
2286.6800000000003,2291.2400000000002, last one for we we we we put the coffee I mean they nailed the coffee on this one what's better

2311.16,2316.2799999999997, it on the DVD now I don't think so but when it does I highly recommend checking it out and and
2316.28,2324.1200000000003, emailing me at Jeff's email and he'll pour it on it what's up with the name of the movie
2324.76,2329.6400000000003, who came up with that I really don't know that's that's a decision that the the movie guys
2330.36,2335.96, figured out uh the kinesk called Dungeon Seed I don't know you know that's I didn't have a whole lot of
2335.96,2341.7200000000003, a close involvement but I was just happy to see the project move forward it was an adventure to uh
2342.04,2348.4399999999996, to to to see the property go to the screen and uh and at the end of the movie you know see my name up there
2348.4399999999996,2355.24, it was fun to to say hey I'm I took I created this property one you know one day and made a game
2355.24,2359.24, and then it's got went to the one to the screen you know I asked my friends who made games you know
2359.24,2364.3599999999997, I say how many how many games have you made that turned into movies and uh that always shuts them up
2364.44,2369.32, yeah that'll shut Sid my right

2417.64,2423.96, about to Chris Taylor all right thanks a lot yeah thanks coming in Chris Chris I did want to ask you
2423.96,2433.16," you know relics work on other people's IP and so barring warhammer and 40,000 as an answer"
2433.16,2439.16, is there any like dream IP that you would like to turn into an RTS or a game of any sort
2441.16,2443.24, an answering bow start glad to go and make a lot of this
2448.52,2453.56, you know what uh got so many things like coming to mind yeah bells are galactic will be awesome but
2453.56,2458.6, I think we would call it homeworld right yeah that's how you've got that's how you worked out you
2458.6,2462.92, got your you have your own games and then you've got you know like you got down a war that you just keep
2462.92,2468.44, you know putting the love into yeah um jazz there's so many like I mean right off the top of my
2468.44,2473.4, headmink cuz I'm reading right now but the game of thrones uh I think that would just been awesome
2473.88,2478.28, so me and on this you you enjoyed our martin fantasy series great fantasy series but it's it's like
2478.28,2484.12, fantasy without the sucky parts of fantasy yeah it's more down the earth fantasy about any sense no
2484.12,2489.0, it's you know what it's I would I would almost call it you know um you know the whole like cyberpunk
2489.0,2492.52, you know if they were gonna do like the fantasy version of cyberpunk it would be like it's
2492.52,2499.4, like fantasy punk it is a really sort of gritty um low fantasy it's just a really awesome kind of dark
2499.4,2503.64, he kills off main characters all the time and in a most awesome way too is like you can't
2503.64,2508.92, believe in like he just killed them I just read 700 pages and he just killed them yeah but yeah
2508.92,2512.84, I think a lot of really interesting things in terms of what could be done within a strategy setting
2512.84,2517.56, that makes it a mystery and it's really interesting um Josh have you played uh Sims of a Solar
2517.56,2521.96, Empire yet no I haven't that's actually all my desk at home um waiting for me to actually have
2521.96,2526.2000000000003, time to play and I'm really really curious about about that again anything in the normal spaceships
2526.2799999999997,2531.24, employing the crap under spaceships I'm all over so yeah it definitely riffs off of home
2531.24,2535.48, world for your instinct the only thing and I can confirm this is apparently there's no single
2535.48,2540.52, player there's no single person in the campaign at all which goes back to the whole tutorial
2540.52,2545.16, but scouting we're having yeah it has a really lame tutorial it's like four different
2545.16,2548.52, little buttons you push and it tells you very rudimentary things and then it just tosses you
2549.24,2554.04, and it's the fray and then later in the discussion after you get through this part throw
2554.12,2558.52, in too many questions that you want but just like what you know how how strongly do you believe
2558.52,2563.16, in the past of rts is a genre to tell stories because clearly you've been you know you wrote
2563.16,2567.08, some of the story some of the dog for a couple of years yeah I have uh and again it's a team
2567.08,2571.56," effort and it's like there's 20,000 lines with dialogue in that game so you know what I think"
2571.56,2577.08, although the other the other meme is the haunts it's the septemish no oh yeah I wrote that one
2577.08,2582.12, because that goes around my circuit it's really that that that the credit goes to a steven nine
2582.2,2586.7599999999998, heart of narrative designer you gotta make um yeah I think yeah you actually doesn't really
2586.7599999999998,2591.56, really awesome stuff um and again it's story it really is really important but I think we're
2591.56,2595.3199999999997, gonna make the distinction between story and narrative because frankly things story sucks in games
2595.3199999999997,2600.7599999999998, right and if you whenever people say story they sort of automatically try to mimic what Hollywood
2600.7599999999998,2605.3199999999997, does what novels do and frankly it's from much better mediums of story but narrative on the other
2605.3199999999997,2610.7599999999998, hands I mean that it's sort of experiential so make that really the setting sort of makes the world
2610.84,2614.0400000000004, come alive to you and you sort of like interacting with it I think it's different so that's why
2614.0400000000004,2618.0400000000004, we don't call them story designers because on narrative designers and within the frame of an
2618.0400000000004,2624.28, artist I think there's a lot of potential for for that kind of narrative again at the Kevin Levenes talk
2624.28,2628.5200000000004, this morning talk about storytelling in bio-shock and it said there me there may means of
2628.5200000000004,2632.36, communicating their story to the player or their narrative to the player was to the environment
2632.36,2636.2000000000003, and that is something you can do really well in an artis because what are you looking at most of the
2636.68,2641.0, world right you have this really awesome gods live view on that world and I don't think we've
2641.0,2646.68, done enough to exploit it to really sort of turn our settings into our main narrative devices so
2646.68,2650.8399999999997, would you say you're doing some of that like in the posing front campaign mission where
2651.48,2655.48, there's a bit of persistence to omission in that you know you might take a town on one evening
2655.48,2660.8399999999997, and then you continue to hold it over the next few days and then you I mean again like narrative I
2660.8399999999997,2664.04, guess what work in the sense that you're not really telling a specific story with all these
2664.12,2668.84, plot details and stuff but you're getting a sense of like this is these are the long-term
2668.84,2673.56, consequences of this kind of interaction you know and this kind of a space and then when you're
2673.56,2677.4, done and you leave and you go on the next thing it's like well that town was level that's it
2677.4,2681.56, exactly that was one of the reasons why I know huge technological hurdles to get this
2681.56,2685.56, or map persistence to work but we thought it was really important for that reason because again
2686.12,2690.12, stories in our ts are very sort of they're really sort of quite work because you don't have a
2690.2,2694.3599999999997, singular point of view and it's and they're really difficult to tell because really the experience
2694.3599999999997,2699.0, of an artist is very nonlinear and to tell it really good story needs to be very linear so again
2699.0,2703.16, getting players the ability to go from one map and the choices that they make and what that they're
2703.16,2707.48, destroying or they're not destroying and the way it affects the next map allows them to craft their
2707.48,2712.2799999999997, own sort of personal narrative of that experience and it automatically makes it their own and every
2712.2799999999997,2716.68, time we would have like focused us with campaign heroes and even after release we keep getting all these
2716.7599999999998,2722.2, awesome stories of all these little moments it just happened uniquely to each player that made the
2722.2,2727.72, experience come alive to them like their stories of like guys and bell towers and they got you know
2727.72,2731.08, tank went up destroyed the bell tower like I went flying out and there's all these really
2731.08,2736.3599999999997, awesome sort of micro personal narratives it's interesting that the choice you guys took for the
2736.3599999999997,2741.48, campaign stories and coming here is is you try to tell you know you try to communicate some of
2741.48,2745.48, some of the events and stuff through the individual people and individual soldiers and their
2745.48,2749.48, characters and that respect that you'll see them and this is as opposed to like you know say CNC
2749.48,2753.72, 3 where you are the general or your an admiral or you know you're you're you're you're so
2753.72,2758.76, one higher up on the the chain of command so I'm curious why you made that decision and if you see
2758.76,2763.2400000000002, potential in the other format so like say for example if there's a company here it was too and it was
2763.2400000000002,2767.8, setting you know modern conflict and then you have these sort of pictures and pictures that are
2767.8,2772.36, like satellite info and it's treating you as though you were someone who was you know working in
2773.32,2779.1600000000003, back at base and orchestrating the flow you know that's something we might I mean I think personally
2780.52,2784.84, I think one of the reasons homeworld really work as a story in a game narrative it's because
2784.84,2790.2000000000003, the player was always implied but it was never directly stated who you are within that's that
2790.2000000000003,2795.08, framework and in a game in the NARTS where really can you controlling so many different things I think
2795.08,2800.28, the more sort of implied the player is the more sort of believable and contextualized experience can
2801.2400000000002,2805.6400000000003, and one of the problems that you run into when you have your little guy on screen and you know
2805.6400000000003,2809.88, you gotta worry about where they can die or not and just it starts introducing all these questions
2810.52,2815.6400000000003, well love said like yeah we're you're never so in the option I'm putting it's like you're never
2815.6400000000003,2820.2000000000003, showing on screen or anything it's basically you and your chair home it's home or rectus is the character
2820.2000000000003,2825.5600000000004, and he is you never need to film specific details for for him or her other than to say like
2826.12,2830.36, you know this is what's happening these are the stakes we we need you to you know we expect
2830.36,2835.24, like casually rate over this percentages intolerable we need you to do these things and here's the
2835.24,2839.4, broader picture and so that it's kind of playing to the fact that you know there's a dramatic irony
2839.4,2843.88, that when you're controlling all this you're aware that say these guys are losing even though
2843.88,2847.0, you're simultaneously giving orders to this squad over here and you know these guys aren't going
2847.0,2850.2, to make it and you know it would be that equivalent of telling guys on this side of screen
2850.2,2852.92, and reinforcements are on the way but you know they're not on the way you know
2853.8,2858.44, yeah I think there's there's there's a potential in that and and again this we were already starting
2858.44,2863.88, to explore some of that on some of the projects we're working on and just try to add a bit more
2863.88,2868.6800000000003, agency because again like home it was awesome because the player was inferred but conversely you know
2868.6800000000003,2872.76, a disembodied nobody is not really somebody you can really get behind and get excited about playing
2873.16,2877.0, so there's definitely a lot of exploration over doing and again that's back to your question
2877.0,2880.12, well look are we doing the kind of games that we really want to do and that's been a really awesome
2880.12,2884.8399999999997, thing about sort of relic and being part of THQ is it they're linked as they're playing these
2884.8399999999997,2889.08, really awesome sandboxes and try to sort of figure out how to release their push things forward so
2890.6,2895.48, sorry do you see yourself going in the direction of more longer complicated narratives or
2895.48,2899.56, of scaling it back like not maybe not to the level of sense of the soul to Empire where there isn't
2899.56,2903.48, one but they're are you happy with their year at now on which direction are you heading um I think
2903.48,2907.24, we're heading and again definitely being said this morning the best stories of the simplest stories
2907.3199999999997,2913.9599999999996, right again half life right so all about just escaping right chronicles of ridics not really a really
2913.9599999999996,2919.0, good example of of a game that has really good story but it's really paper thin homeworld again
2920.04,2925.8799999999997, get home right so I think it's the key of having really simple narrative that doesn't mean they can't
2925.8799999999997,2930.52, be deep or they can't have meaning or anything but I think sometimes you get too enamored with
2930.52,2935.8799999999997, where storytellers and we got to tell you this complex story so it's really finding the balance between
2935.88,2940.76, having a believable pretext and it's sort of satisfying context for your game and on this is
2940.76,2945.0, certainly playing the player with tons and tons of dialogue well like I mean you know all the
2945.0,2951.2400000000002, game is that we were spotting to a GFW well you know the narrative fasty like portal you know by
2951.2400000000002,2954.6800000000003, a shock and stuff there's really not that may I mean there's there's not much that dialogue a lot
2954.6800000000003,2959.6400000000003, of it's just applied you just put enough on there to let people fill in a reactive emotionally
2959.64,2966.04, and fill in the rest with their imagination you know can we uh because they're all looking
2966.04,2970.52, I don't want to start geeking out on specific company here or stuff but we're all going to leave
2970.52,2973.7999999999997, you guys could do that if you have to because there's I know there's a lot of our listeners
2973.7999999999997,2977.4, I've turned on in the game and they want to hear but I want to know I mean even basic stuff like
2978.2,2983.0, I know most people play the game that he won v1 I'm really into playing it either 2v2
2983.0,2987.4, 3v3 or 4v4 and I want to know you know if you got more 3v3 and 4v4 maps coming
2988.36,2994.76, We have a number of things on the pipe I think nothing me I think we're in the final stages of
2995.08,3002.04, releasing our latest patch is actually going to introduce team automatch right and I think that's
3002.04,3006.2000000000003, running smoothly we'll start introducing more maps that really sort of support and encourage sort of
3006.2000000000003,3010.6800000000003, team team games how's the the beta been going because you know in the past what you've done is you've
3010.6800000000003,3016.04, released you've waited wait and you released a patch then you find out that maybe you're a
3016.12,3020.68, looks something right and so now you get this thing where all players can access the beta patch and
3020.68,3024.84, it's constantly being revised sometimes it's like boom the very next day you figure something out
3024.84,3029.64, and it's going back and forth on all the various acts is of how powerful something is if it's too
3029.64,3035.56, effective or under effective is that working out well for you guys Jeff just already dying
3035.56,3044.52, over here in the corner wow no our our beta patch is going fantastic it's been a really great process
3044.6,3049.24, again the more you're involved with community the better the feedback you get and the more buy
3049.24,3054.12, and you get from them right there I mean without the community you really don't have a sustainable game right
3054.12,3059.88, so giving them a chance to sort of help guide that process and telling us what you do in a way that
3059.88,3064.12, we don't really piss them off because it's not the final patch I think it really really good
3065.08,3069.4, good step you ever considered at throwing together like maybe a couple cooperative missions for people
3069.7200000000003,3075.0, they also don't really really wanted yeah like I haven't finished it this is that thing come
3075.0,3078.52, here my favorite game I haven't finished any of the campaigns I've dabbled in them all and it's
3078.52,3082.44, because I can't play my own yeah I know that's the one to play I don't know so that's one of the
3082.44,3086.36, challenges we're tackling this year okay that would be awesome yeah it would be very good I would
3086.36,3091.96, second the the idea that and it would be well because I find in the game you're talking about whether
3091.96,3096.92, you find other ways to bring people in and you know I thought it tutorials and stuff I find through
3097.08,3101.0, you have some coach you through it right and the buddy system yeah and that way you're able to
3101.0,3105.64, do it other than just say let's all right gone we got it like tonight it's like I got you know Robert
3105.64,3111.0, Ashley aka Bobito he's a regular show I got him hooked up he's gonna go in and learn and he's been
3111.0,3114.52, trying to campaign and today at lunch he's asked me what about this and this and like okay we got
3114.52,3118.28, a play but I'm like great now I get a look forward to an evening of like compost stomping is I tell
3118.28,3123.96, him like you don't do that quit it's not stark out of quit making as many of this fucking unit as
3123.96,3133.48, you possibly claim yeah so they would be cool yeah I think all this is a big mixing so a big thing for
3133.48,3141.16, future future product or for oh yeah I think I think I think again co-op is huge right I mean I've never
3141.16,3146.52, finished any of the hails by myself right it's always been cool off right and in fact you know
3146.52,3150.52, Call of Duty 4 is an awesome game right but I wanted to share that also this with someone right
3151.4,3156.52, so I think I think all of us are really big yeah so I did T. S. mean like like what two of you would
3156.52,3161.56, go against the AI well imagine the campaigns as they are they they clearly have to change them you
3161.56,3165.8, know they you'd have to have more enemies or depending on how it works out you know each of you
3165.8,3169.72, you get a bounce differently if each of you're playing different roles and stuff but I think you're basically
3169.72,3174.04, going through the story to clarify that right now you can actually play co-op because you can play what we call
3174.04,3178.44, skirmish mode so we can all get together and we can you know a chance that comp stom so playing
3178.52,3182.36, into computer and so that's a that's a co-op experience really what what I'm referring to
3182.36,3186.84, when I say co-op experiences take our sort of like finally crafted single player experience where
3186.84,3191.7200000000003, like we're carefully taking the player through as a series of really really cool experiences
3191.7200000000003,3197.0, and allow players to share that you know with with with their buddies right so so we're already
3197.0,3201.4, we do skirmish are just adding co-op to our our single player campaigns right there's some
3201.4,3205.64, cut tons of single player campaigns have you playing you know whatever faction you're playing and then
3205.96,3211.4, the other faction maybe faction b have to do a camp over there so imagine imagine your friend
3211.4,3215.24, takes over that and is or is the guy sending the reinforcements every five minutes or something like
3215.24,3222.92, the that would be pretty rare so when when can we expect to hear more about the the expansion
3223.56,3228.6, and it's cool stuff because you listen to the show ever you like that would about how I need
3228.6,3233.96, the off-road or like I could deal with like the T.O. the Mediterranean theater operations or
3234.12,3239.0, you know which it also includes Africa you mentioned a specific thing but it's like if you
3239.0,3243.08, guys listen to that you guys laugh or you like smart you know we're a little bit later we have like
3243.08,3248.36, we have a five-year plan for company heroes I'm we're in year we're beginning of year two or three
3248.36,3254.68, even in which when you when we start the clock so we love the franchise you know sales could be
3254.68,3260.2, better right and again I think you know piracy high systems aspects of a part to playing that as well
3260.2,3266.3599999999997, did you pick up quite a few players this past holiday season yeah yeah yeah we we broke our
3266.3599999999997,3271.08, maximum players online records we keep breaking it every couple of weeks we break it so it's a really
3271.08,3275.3199999999997, good sign it's more and more people are playing you know that's that's really awesome so how have your
3275.3199999999997,3280.9199999999996, steam numbers banders opposed to retail steam has been fantastic can you give us those numbers if I could
3280.9199999999996,3285.24, actually find those numbers I would be really happy that's up to you guys though right it's I mean you
3285.24,3288.9199999999996, guys can say hey we we're willing to share a steam numbers because your no one does that
3289.88,3294.76, I just I don't know there's a whole sort of machinery in place and getting those numbers
3294.76,3298.28, it's really requires like you know you gotta talk to somebody and somebody's gonna take somebody
3298.28,3302.12, in it just takes a while for those numbers okay back from it because that's interesting because
3302.12,3305.4, what valve is pitching with their new you know how they're they're they're making this available
3305.4,3309.88, that steam works available everyone's that like in real time you're able to see like so hey
3310.6,3314.76, you know there was like whatever something just happened and then now the stuff we got more
3314.84,3320.6000000000004, more downloads the with there was an advertisement that ran that the game is 20% off boom then we just picked
3320.6000000000004,3324.84, up a bunch all sorts of things so you're you're saying there's some like well I just your
3324.84,3329.5600000000004, accuracy involved and look at the steam works so the the what I'm trying to say is is generally where
3329.5600000000004,3332.6000000000004, we get ourselves when you're somewhere to say where I get them again we're a sort of in the
3332.6000000000004,3338.1200000000003, development sign and you know we don't really you're wearing Vancouver and they're call of us you
3338.1200000000003,3343.0, need to know only as far as it keeps the keeps your check coming yeah well that's so much but
3343.0,3347.72, we usually get a data from MPD but it doesn't track any of the steam sales that has to go through
3347.72,3352.36, a whole difference or reporting mechanism the the only thing I've heard is that we're selling this
3352.36,3358.28, well on steam as we do it best by right and those are huge numbers wow yeah and it's it's been really
3358.28,3363.4, good and it's it's it's it's just great you know that is interesting though because there's a lot of
3363.4,3368.36, us it's like the Paulianna approach when you hear about you know the horrible sales of PC high profile
3368.44,3374.84, games you want to say well there's a whole lot going down through digital distribution so not like you
3374.84,3380.52, don't want to hear the steam numbers are as good as a specific retail of giant but as it is that they
3380.52,3386.04, rival retail sales period yeah across all again I don't have the data but I don't think they're quite
3386.04,3391.32, right right like if you get at up all the retail sales and all the distribution sales I don't think
3391.32,3397.0, they're they're on par yet but it's definitely I mean I mean I all the games I bought in the last
3397.0,3401.24, year and half have all been through steam right I actually bought a posting front so on steam
3401.88,3407.08, you know you had to buy it by right I I want to do I want to do because it's just one extra
3407.08,3412.04, no effort because steam is just so easy right I didn't want to think I didn't want to install it
3412.04,3416.76, because yeah I'm sorry you I just want to apologize for all the people who are just like we had a
3416.76,3422.84, really long install time so yeah sorry about that so what about like steam you know using steam
3422.92,3427.6400000000003, works for achievements and stuff you know that yeah there's some very interesting stuff there's
3427.6400000000003,3433.0, something that we've been trying to do like on our own and also about as much as I can say about that but
3434.2000000000003,3439.56, it's definitely interesting it's interesting because you the game launched as a games for Windows
3439.56,3445.2400000000002, brand at game so you've got that on the one but it's not a game for Windows live game no um and that's
3445.2400000000002,3448.76, confusing in it of itself that there's differences in that but then it's like now you got a
3448.76,3453.48, achievements on steam it might be an option to go with with the games for Windows live thing can
3453.48,3458.28, you even talk about that I mean what's your take on games for Windows live um well my personal take for PC you
3458.28,3464.5200000000004, know I mean that is it works fantastic on the 360 because there's no other way of doing that kind of
3464.5200000000004,3471.2400000000002, stuff on the 360 on on the PC they have some big challenges right I mean really I don't think there's
3471.2400000000002,3475.7200000000003, any studios there are any other big studios they have a jumped on on the Xbox live and it's just
3476.12,3483.08, they're just trying to apply the same model they had on the console onto the PC and there's some really
3483.08,3487.9599999999996, good stuff in there but I do think being a little bit more flexible or serving courage more
3488.52,3496.3599999999997, sort of developer basically doing what's valves doing I possible I'm getting the wrap up singles
3496.9199999999996,3504.3599999999997, well Ryan and I have to us but okay you guys can keep talking if you want you've got a GDC appointment
3506.04,3513.9599999999996, carry on Ryan says carry on like I have like ten or some more minutes okay we could be good then we
3513.9599999999996,3523.3999999999996, you want throw a throw finale and okay okay so now that you can give us this wonderful conclusion
3525.48,3530.68, thank you how about this how am I right this and we out thanks for coming to Josh
3531.64,3538.12, you really you're editing magic to make that awesome fact I didn't there's no editing
3538.12,3543.24, these these this is GDC it's like he's doing these over and over again all day you press
3543.24,3548.68, out process he presses post is really bad I'll do this now this is all we want to
3549.3199999999997,3553.3199999999997, this is all part of the show and we out that's why I said we out
